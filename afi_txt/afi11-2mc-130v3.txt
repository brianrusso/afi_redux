Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.  (T-2) 1.4.1.  Although  this  publication  provides  guidance  for  aircraft  operations  under  most circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment.  When it is necessary to protect the crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate action is  required,  the  Pilot  In  Command  (PIC)  has  ultimate  authority  and  responsibility  for  the course  of  action  to  be  taken.    Report  deviations,  without  waiver,  through  channels  to MAJCOM/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report, if requested.  Unless otherwise indicated,  HQ AFSOC/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for  operational  procedure  requirements contained in this volume.  Request waivers through Stan/Eval channels.  (T-2) 1.4.2.  In  the  absence  of  a  designated  Commander  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces (COMAFSOF);  the  HQ  AFSOC/A3  may  grant  COMAFSOF  waiver  authority  to  an individual in writing.  (T-2) 1.4.2.1.  When waiver authority is delegated, HQ AFSOC/A3V will receive a copy of all approved waivers.  (T-2)   14  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 1.4.3.  This  instruction,  AFI  11-2MC-130,  Vol  3,  is  a  source  document  for  guidance  and procedures within AFSOC.  The dynamic nature of flying operations demands crew members and  mission  planners  reference  the  parent  source  documents.    Parent  source  documents  are listed  in  order  to  ensure  the  operators  have  the  most  current  and  accurate  information available to conduct flying operations. 1.4.4.  Tier Waiver Authority IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management  is as follows: 1.4.4.1.  “Tier 0” (T-0) Requirement is external to the Air Force and consequence of non-compliance is determined by respective non-AF authority.  Requests for waivers must be processed through command channels to publication OPR for consideration. 1.4.4.2.  “Tier  1”  (T-1)  Non-compliance  puts  Airmen,  commanders,  or  the  USAF strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or unacceptable,  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waiver  authority  is  the  MAJCOM/CC  (Delegable no lower than the MAJCOM Director) with concurrence of the publication’s Approving Official 1.4.4.3.  “Tier  2”  (T-2)  Non-compliance  may  degrade  mission  or  program  effectiveness or  efficiency  and  has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable, fraud, waste or abuse.  Waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (Delegable no lower than the MAJCOM Director) 1.4.4.4.  “Tier  3”  (T-3)  Non-compliance  may  limit  mission  or  program  effectiveness  or efficiency  and  has  a  relatively  remote  potential  to  create  risk  of  mission  or  program failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable,  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waiver authority is the Wing/CC (Delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent) 1.5.  Distribution.  Distribute this instruction as shown in Table 1.1.  (T-2) Table 1.1.  Distribution.

Local  Operating  Procedures.    In  accordance  with  (IAW)  Chapter  10  of  this instruction.  (T-2) 1.7.  Roles and Responsibilities.  Refer to Paragraph 1.4.   16  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  Operational  Control  (OPCON).  AFSOC  is  designated  as  the  controlling  agency  for United  States  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)-assigned  Air  Force  Special Operations  Forces  (SOF)  aircraft,  while  Theater  Special  Operations  Commands  (TSOC)  have OPCON  of  theater-based  assets.    In  practice,  responsibility  for  planning  and  executing  home-station AFSOC missions is routinely delegated to the Wing or Group Commander.  (T-3)   The Wing (Wg) or Group (Gp) Commander (CC), in turn, normally exercises control of home-station missions  through  the  command  post  supporting  the  wing  or  group.    (T-3)    In  the  event  that assigned  forces  undergo  a  Change  in  Operational  Control  (CHOP),  responsibility  for  mission monitoring  passes  from  the  wing  or  group  Command  and  Control  (C2)  facility  to  the  gaining command.    (T-3)    Changeover  will  be  accomplished  IAW  the  pertinent  Operational  Plan, Operational Order, or deployment or execution order.  (T-2) 2.1.1.  Waiver request will be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control of the mission.  Operational waivers will be coordinated through the Stan/Eval channels.  (T-2) 2.2.  Waiver and Approval Authorities. 2.2.1.  Wg/CCs  hold  waiver/approval  authority  for  items  normally  authorized  at  or  below wing level Including:  (T-3) 2.2.1.1.  Deployments. 2.2.1.2.  Air Apportionment Allocation Conference taskings. 2.2.1.3.  Joint Air Apportionment Allocation Conference (JAAAC) taskings. 2.2.1.4.  Joint  Combined  Exchange  Training  (JCET)/Counter  Narcotics  Training missions. 2.2.1.5.  Other specified missions as tasked via the SOF Air Tasking Order (ATO) in the special ops application software suite (SOFAPPS). 2.2.1.6.  Continental  United  States  (CONUS)  and  outside  continental  United  States (OCONUS)  forces  depart  a  TSOC/Joint  Special  Operations  Air  Component  (JSOAC) Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)  en  route  to  United  States  Northern  Command (NORTHCOM) AOR. 2.2.2.  Operational waivers will be coordinated through Stan/Eval channels.  Waiver requests will  normally  be  the  responsibility  of  the  C2  agency  with  the  operational  control  of  the mission. 2.2.3.  Wg/CC  OPCON  terminates  when  forces  enter  a  TSOC/JSOAC  AOR  and  picks  up when forces exit a TSOC/JSOAC AOR. 2.3.  Mission  Monitoring.  Except  for  selected  close-hold  missions  and  above  wing  level (AWL)  taskings,  the  individual  wing  command  centers  monitor  their  aircraft  to,  from,  or between off-station locations.  (T-3)  The Command Centers track off-station aircraft via the Air Mobility  Command  (AMC)  C2  system  and  direct  reporting  from  aircrew  and  command  post AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   17  personnel.    (T-3)    Key  components  of  the  AMC  C2  system  are  the  Airlift  Implementation  and Monitoring System (AIMS), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS), and the various AMC C2  facilities  at  theater  and  wing  locations.    Information  on  scheduled  activity  comes  from  the wings  who  input  AIMS  data  for  all  upcoming  missions  except  local  missions  not  scheduled  to land  outside  the  local  flying  area  or  close-hold  missions  that  cannot  be  accommodated  by classified AIMS setups.  When aircraft are deployed in support of operations and exercises, the C2  agency  with  OPCON  obtains  additional  information  from  situation  reports  (SITREP)  and Deployed Status Reports (DSR).  (T-3)  The following mission monitoring procedures primarily apply  to  missions  that  are  not  close-hold  in  nature  and  have  not  been  chopped  to  another  C2 agency: 2.3.1.  Wing (or equivalent) Command Posts track CONUS movements of their aircraft and directly input mission information into the GDSS.  (T-2) 2.3.2.  Data  on  CONUS  movements  of  theater-based  aircraft  are  collected  by  the  AFSOC Command Center via GDSS updates.  These are based on information received from AMC Command  Posts  and  direct  reporting  from  aircrews  who  takeoff  or  land  at  non-AMC locations.  (T-1) 2.3.3.  Information  on  OCONUS  movements  of  AFSOC  aircraft (CONUS  or  theater-based) comes  to  the  AFSOC  Command  Center  via  GDSS  or  telephone  notification  from  the overseas host group command posts.  The host unit command posts receive their data from the  aircrews  directly  or  via  the  Special  Operations  Command  and  Control  Squadron (SOCCS) or Special Operations Command and Control Element (SOCCE). 2.3.4.  PIC or mission commander flight reporting duties: 2.3.4.1.  Unclassified Missions at Bases with an AMC C2 Facility.  Mission commanders will ensure that the following information  is relayed to the AMC C2 facility at least  30 minutes prior to landing:  call signs, mission numbers, Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA), maintenance  status,  and  additional  service  requirements.    After  landing,  the  mission commander will contact the C2 facility with ground handling requirements and departure information.  In addition, CONUS based crews operating within the CONUS must keep their  home  station  command  posts  appraised  of  all  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times, projected takeoff times, and other related information.  (T-2) 2.3.4.2.  Unclassified  Missions  at  bases  without  an  AMC  C2  Facility.    Mission commanders  will  report,  as  soon  as  possible,  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times, maintenance  status,  projected  takeoff  times,  and  other  pertinent  data  to  the  host  wing command post, special operations control center, or AFSOC Command Center whichever is most applicable.  Methods of communicating this information include high frequency (HF),  phone  patch,  defense  switched  network  (DSN),  and  commercial  telephone.  CONUS  based  crews  operating  within  the  CONUS  must  also  ensure  that  their  home station command posts receive real-time reports on aircraft movements.  (T-2) 2.3.4.3.  AIMS  Missions.   When  operating  on  classified  missions,  the  mission commander  will  pass  movement  reports  to  the  appropriate  C2  facility.    (T-2)    If necessary, the mission commander can call on an unclassified line and report.  (T-3)  For example:    “Loaded  and  ready  to  go  at  site  X,  estimated  time  of  departure  (ETD)  is 1400Z”.   18  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 2.3.4.4.

The final responsibility regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the PIC.  If one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with the same item or system inoperative.  When the PIC considers an item essential, designate the component mission essential (ME) on the Air Force Technical Order (AFTO) Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.  (T-2) 4.2.  Policy.  This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment.  If the PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  system(s),  coordinate  mission requirements  (i.e.,  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  maintenance  requirements,  etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions.  (T-2) 4.3.  Aircraft Operating Guidelines: 4.3.1.  Pressurization  and  Air-Conditioning  Systems:   Pressurization  and  both  air-conditioning systems should be operational if patients are carried.  If a system fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue (coordinate with the senior medical crew member when patients  are  carried)  to  a  destination  with  repair  capability.    Required  en  route  stops  are authorized.  Brief the passengers and patients on the possibility of personal discomfort.  This is  not  required  for  low-level  missions  if  a  reasonable  temperature  can  be  maintained.  Aircraft must comply with applicable TO avionics cooling requirements.  (T-2) 4.3.2.  Electrical System.  All engine generators should be operational prior to departure from home  station.    If  a  generator  fails  at  an  en  route  stop,  the  mission  may  continue  to  a destination with repair capability.  Required en route stops are authorized.  If the aircraft is not  equipped  with  generator  disconnects,  the  generator  will  be  removed  and  the  mount padded before flight.  (T-2) 4.3.3.  An  operative  air  turbine  motor  (ATM)  or  auxiliary  power  unit  (APU)  generator  is required  for  unrestricted  flight.    If  the  system  is  inoperative,  flight  in  daylight  visual meteorological  conditions  (VMC)  within  100  nautical  miles  (nm)  of  a  suitable  airfield  is permissible provided no other electrical malfunction exists.  (T-2) 4.3.4.  Fuel  System.    The  primary  concern  with  inoperative  fuel  boost  pumps  or  quantity indicators  is  fuel  balance  and  wing  loading.    Degraded  operation  is  permissible;  however, flight  crews  must  consider  potentially  trapped  fuel  and  decreased  range  should  further degradation  occur.    The  following  paragraphs  provide  guidelines  for  degraded  fuel  system operations under most circumstances.  (T-2) 4.3.4.1.  One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel. 4.3.4.2.  One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative.  Two main tank indicators may be inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   27  4.3.4.2.1.  Verify  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  and  its  symmetrical  tank quantity using a fuel tank dipstick. 4.3.4.2.2.  At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank. 4.3.4.2.3.  Begin cross feed operation when any main tank decreases to 2,000 pounds. 4.3.4.2.4.  Engine  out  training  using  the  engine  corresponding  to  the  inoperative indicator  or  its  symmetrically  opposite  will  not  be  conducted  during  tank  to  engine operation. 4.3.4.2.5.  Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow. 4.3.4.2.6.  Plan to land with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel. 4.3.4.3.  One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel tanks  are  checked  full  or  empty.    Both  external  fuel  tank  indicators  may  be  inoperative provided  both  external  tanks  are  checked  empty.    When  an  external  tank  indicator  is inoperative  and  the  tank  cannot  be  visually  checked  empty  due  to  foam  modification, comply with the following prior to flight: 4.3.4.3.1.  Check  pressure  with  each  pump  in  the  external  tank.    If  no  pressure  is obtained, the tank is verified empty. 4.3.4.3.2.  If  pressure  is  obtained,  ground  transfer  the  fuel  from  the  external  tank.  Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer. 4.3.4.3.3.  When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the tank on cross feed until no pressure is obtained.  This will be completed prior to takeoff. 4.3.4.4.  Both  auxiliary  tank  indicators  may  be  inoperative  provided  auxiliary  fuel quantity is verified by the tank sight gauge. 4.3.4.5.  Both  a  main  and  external  fuel  tank  indicator  may  be  inoperative  on  the  same wing provided steps in Paragraphs 4.3.4.2 and 4.3.4.3 are followed. 4.3.4.6.  For  other  than  normal  ground  refueling/defueling  operations  and  associated guidelines per this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external fuel  tank  with  an  inoperative  indicator  or  its  symmetrical  tank  except  per  the  following guidance: 4.3.4.6.1.  Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel situations only.  All transfers, under these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the pilot/copilot as a backup for lateral wing balance. 4.3.4.6.1.1.  A  reliable  source  of  known  quantity  transferred  must  be  available.  This  source  can  be  either  AAR  gauges  or  internal  operating  fuel  tank  quantity indicators (Tanker Air Refueling). 4.3.4.6.1.2.  Maintain  symmetrical  tanks  within  1,000  pounds  at  all  times.    If small  amounts  (4,000  pounds  or  less)  must  be  transferred,  then  transfer  up  to 1,000  pounds  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  followed  by  an  equal   28  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 amount into the tank(s) with operative indicator(s).  If large amounts of fuel must be  transferred,  then  transfer  1,000  pounds  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative indicator,  then  up  to  2,000  pounds  as  needed  into  the  tank(s)  with  the  operative indicators,  then  up  to  1,000  pounds  as  needed  into  the  tank  with  the  inoperative indicator  to  bring  all  tanks  symmetrical,  or  continue  up  to  2,000  pounds  as needed, repeating the cycle until desired fuel quantity and balance is achieved in applicable tanks. 4.3.4.6.2.  During  tanker  AAR  operations,  fuel  may  be  transferred  from  tanks  with inoperative  main  or  external  tanks  only  if  the  receiver  requires  emergency  fuel.    In this situation, the following procedures will apply: (T-2) 4.3.4.6.2.1.  The  fuel  flow  counter  for  the  refueling  pod  being  used  must  be operational to track the amount of fuel transferred. 4.3.4.6.2.2.  Transfer from only one tank at a time. 4.3.4.6.2.3.  Transfer no more than 1,000 pounds at a time between the tanks with the inoperative indicator and its symmetrical tank to monitor fuel balance. 4.3.5.  Antiskid  System:    The  antiskid  may  be  inoperative  for  flight  to  a  destination  with repair capability.  Required en route stops are authorized. 4.3.5.1.  A local training flight may continue once airborne if the antiskid fails provided the system is turned off.  The mission is restricted to one termination landing.  (T-2) 4.3.5.2.  Maximum effort landings are not authorized with antiskid inoperative.  (T-2) 4.3.6.  Landing  Gear  System:    If  a  landing  gear  system  or  position  indicator  malfunction  is encountered, only a full stop landing will be made.  The discrepancy will be corrected prior to Exception:    If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a  positive  determination  is  made  that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position.  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-2) next the flight.   4.3.7.  Doors  and  Ramp  System:    Aircraft  will  not  depart  on  a  pressurized  flight  unless  the door warning light system for the cargo ramp is operative.  (T-2) 4.3.7.1.  Aircraft will not depart with a crew entrance door or crew entrance door warning light malfunction.  (T-2) 4.3.7.2.  Aircraft  will  not  be  flown  pressurized  with  a  cargo  ramp  lock  malfunction.  Unpressurized flight is authorized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction only when mission requirements dictate.  (T-2) 4.3.8.  Navigation Systems. 4.3.8.1.  Heading  Sources.    Two  independent  sources  of  heading  are  required.    The standby Note:  For flights above 72° of latitude, two inertial navigation units (INU) or one INU and an operable global positioning system (GPS) are required.

On  aircraft  equipped  with  dual  INUs,  both should  be  operational.    If  all  the  available  INU(s)  are  inoperable  refer  to  the  flight manual to determine additional restrictions.  (T-2) 4.3.8.2.  Compass Systems.  When two systems are installed, both should be operational.  If  one  system  fails,  refer  to  the  flight  manual  to  determine  what  other  equipment  is affected.  (T-2) 4.3.8.3.  For  flights  on  all  other  Category  I  routes,  the  PIC  determines  the  minimum navigational  capability  required  to  safely  accomplish  the  mission.    Consider  the following:  length and route of flight, weather, experience, and proficiency of the crew. 4.3.8.4.  Drift  and  Ground  Speed  (GS).    Two  independent  sources  of  drift  and  GS  are required for flight.  (T-2) 4.3.9.  Radar.    Weather  mode  radar  must  be  operative  for  flights  into  areas  of  known  or forecast thunderstorms.  (T-2) 4.3.10.  The  following  systems  (if  equipped)  should  be  operational  as  listed  below  for  all departures unless parts are not available on station to repair the system. 4.3.10.1.  Enhanced  Traffic  Alert  and  Collision  Avoidance  System  (ETCAS).    Comply with host nation rules governing aircraft flying without ETCAS.  (T-2) 4.3.10.2.  Ground Collision Avoidance System (GCAS). 4.3.10.3.  Cockpit  Voice  Recorder  (CVR).    For  failure  after  departure,  flight  may continue to a destination with repair capability.  Required en route stops are authorized. 4.3.11.  Standby Instruments.  On the MC-130H, if the standby Attitude Direction Indicator (ADI)  or  standby Vertical Velocity Indicator (VVI)  is  inoperative, the aircraft  may  only  be flown  in  day  VMC  conditions.    If  any  of  the  other  standby  pitot-static  instruments  are inoperative, the aircraft will not be flown.  (T-2) 4.3.12.

Deviations: 5.9.1.1.  The  nonflying  pilot  will  inform  the  flying  pilot  when  heading  or  airspeed deviations  are  observed,  or  when  altitude  is  more  than  100  ft  from  the  desired  and  no attempt is being made to correct the deviation.  (T-2) 5.9.1.2.  Any crew member seeing a deviation of 200 ft altitude or 10 knots in airspeed, or  a  potential  terrain  or  obstruction  problem,  will  immediately  notify  the  flying  pilot.  Deviations from prescribed procedures will also be announced.  (T-2) 5.10.  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR)  and  Runway  Surface  Condition  (RSC).  The performance  charts  used  to  determine  braking  action  are  based  on  concrete  runways.    The runway  surface  should  be  considered  wet  when  water  on  the  runway  causes  a  reflective  glare.  Use  the  RCR  values  for  the  following  runway  surfaces  in  Table  5.5  in  the  absence  of  TO information/guidance directing RCR calculations.  Refer to performance manual TO or Section B  of  the  Flight  Information  Handbook  for  generalized  changes  in  landing  roll  based  on  RCR.

Limit C-130 operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering of one inch.  This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one inch of slush or water.  (T-2) 5.11.  Wake Turbulence Avoidance.  Pilots must ensure wake turbulence avoidance criteria are met  during  flight  operations.    Acceptance  of  a  visual  or  contact  approach  clearance  or instructions  to  follow  an  aircraft  is  acknowledgment  the  pilot  will  maintain  a  safe  interval  for wake  turbulence  avoidance.    Adhere  to  aircraft  wake  turbulence  avoidance  and  separation criteria contained in DoD FLIP planning (General Planning (GP) Chapter 5).  (T-2) 5.12.  Landing  Zone  (LZ)  Markings.  LZ  markings  may  vary  depending  upon  the  supporting agency  (refer  to  AFI  13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations).    The  markings  to  be used  must  be  firmly  established  during  mission  planning  and  included  in  the  aircrew  briefing.  (T-2) 5.13.  Aircraft  Rescue  Firefighting  (ARFF)  Requirements.  ARFF  requirements  are  as follows: 5.13.1.  Not more than four takeoffs and four landings within seven consecutive days may be accomplished  at  a  LZ  or  airfield  without  ARFF.    Each  Group/Wing  should  track  totals  at airfields under their control.  If totals are not tracked at airfields owned/controlled by other agencies, Wing/Group current operations will track to ensure the restriction is not exceeded for assigned aircraft.  (T-2) 5.13.2.  For  more  frequent  operations  at  a  LZ  or  airfield,  refer  to  Air  Force  Pamphlet (AFPAM)  322004,  Aircraft  Fire  Protection  for  Exercises  and  Contingency  Operations,  to calculate ARFF requirements and determine if MAJCOM/A3 approval is required.  Requests will Note:    Non-USAF  ARFF  vehicles  may  be  used  if  the  agent  and  pumping  capabilities  are equivalent. case-by-case considered basis.  (T-2)    be on a 5.14.  Wind  Limitations.  Maximum  crosswind  limits  are  in  accordance  with  aircraft  TO limitations.  Remain within the “Recommended” or “Caution” areas of the crosswind charts for normal  takeoffs  and  landings.   All  maximum  effort  operations  must  fall  within  the “Recommended”  area  unless  otherwise  approved  by  the  Group  Commander/COMAFSOF  (for contingency operations). (T-3) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   35  5.15.  Operating  in  the  Vicinity  of  Thunderstorms.  Avoid thunderstorms and cumulonimbus clouds (CB) using the following criteria:  (T-2) 5.15.1.  Climb Out, En Route, and Descent: 5.15.1.1.  FL 230 and above:  20 nm. 5.15.1.2.  Below FL 230:  10 nm. 5.15.1.3.  Low-level operations:  5 nm. 5.15.2.  The  size  and  intensity  of  thunderstorms  or  CBs  are  so  variable  that  the  PIC  must determine  avoidance  takeoff  and  landing  criteria.    Takeoff,  approach  and  landing  may  be made without regard to the criteria in Paragraph 5.15 of this instruction, provided:  (T-2) 5.15.2.1.  The thunderstorm or CBs and associated gust front, if present, can be avoided. 5.15.2.2.  The  distance  from  the  thunderstorm  or  CBs  is  increased  as  soon  as  possible after takeoff to meet the criteria in Paragraph 5.15. 5.15.2.3.  The  missed  approach  course  from  the  missed  approach  point  will  provide separation similar to that of climb out. 5.15.2.4.  The  aircraft  is  not  flown  below  thunderstorms,  CBs,  or  through  the  rain  shaft associated with these clouds. 5.15.3.  Avoid gust fronts and winds preceding a rapidly moving thunderstorm, and the rain shaft and cloud base of thunderstorms and CBs.  Do not fly under the anvil of a CB.  (T-2) 5.15.3.1.  Avoid  thunderstorms  visually,  by  airborne  radar,  or  by  specific  request  of  a ground-based  radar  with  a  weather  mapping  capability.    When  relying  exclusively  on ground-based radar for weather avoidance and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by either changing routing or diverting to  an  alternate.    If  unable  to  maintain  VMC,  declare  an  emergency  and  request  priority assistance. Note:    The use  of  ground-based radar  as  the  primary  means  of  thunderstorm  avoidance should  be  used  only  to  depart  an  area  of  significant  weather.    It  should  never  be considered a normal avoidance procedure.  (T-2)    5.16.  Departure/Arrival  Planning.  Comply  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  and  AFMAN  11-217, Vol 1, Instrument Flight Procedures.  If using a flight plan furnished by another agency, the PIC and navigator will verify routes and flight altitudes to ensure proper terrain clearance.  (T-2) 5.16.1.  The  PIC  will  provide  the  obstacle  height,  distance,  and  gradient  information necessary for performance computations for the departure, alternate, and destination airfields to the flight engineer.  A pilot crew member or additional flight engineer will cross-check the Takeoff  and  Landing  Data  (TOLD)  card(s)  for  accuracy  using  the  performance  manual, TOLD computer, or approved tabulated data.  At a minimum, the person checking the data will:  (T-2) 5.16.1.1.  Verify gross weight independently from both TOLD cards. 5.16.1.2.  Cross-check air minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds.   36  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 5.16.1.3.  Review  and  compare  the  computed  distances,  ground  roll,  and  climb  gradient (if applicable) with the actual conditions, runway available, and departure procedures. 5.17.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  Use  normal  takeoff  and  landing  procedures whenever  practical.    For  mission  accomplishment,  if  approach  end  overruns  are  available  and stressed or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for  takeoff.    All  speeds  and  distances  will  be  computed  “without  nosewheel  steering”.    When required  for  mission  accomplishment,  the  PIC  may  authorize  “with  nosewheel  steering” corrections  on  dry,  hard-surfaced  runways.    Minimum  runway  width  is  60  ft  or  19  meters.  Minimum taxiway width is 30 ft or 9 meters.  (T-2) 5.17.1.  Normal Operations:  (T-2) 5.17.1.1.  Takeoff Minimum.  The minimum runway length is the greater of balanced or unbalanced critical field length (CFL). 5.17.1.2.  Landing.    Minimum  runway  length  is  landing  distance  plus  the  following corrections: 5.17.1.2.1.  Runway Visual Range (RVR) less than 4,000 ft (3/4 mile) – add 1,000 ft. 5.17.1.2.2.  RVR equal to or greater than 4,000 ft (3/4 mile) – add 500 ft. 5.17.1.2.3.  If  runway  length  available  for  landing  is  less  than  required  by  the previous criteria, crews may use landing ground roll plus 1,500 ft when approved by the  squadron  commander.    Landing  touchdown  must  occur  in  the  first  500  ft  of  the runway/landing surface. 5.17.2.  Short Field Operations. 5.17.2.1.  Only maximum effort landing qualified crews may use short field procedures.  Use  of  non-hard-surfaced requires  Group  Commander (COMAFSOF  for  contingency  operations)  approval.    (T-3)    Groups  may  list  approved locations in Chapter 10. runways  or taxiways 5.17.2.2.  Takeoff.    Minimum  runway  length  is  charted  minimum  field  length  for maximum effort takeoff (MFLMETO).  If runway available is greater than MFLMETO, then  correct  for  one-engine  inoperative  air  minimum  control  speed  in  ground  effect (Vmca).  (T-2) 5.17.2.2.1.  When  obstacles  are  a  factor,  use  actual  maximum  effort  takeoff  speed (Vmeto)  and  climb  out  at  maximum  effort  obstacle  clearance  speed.    (T-2)  WARNING:  Aircraft performance and obstacle clearance is based on obtaining and then  maintaining  obstacle  clearance  speed  as  quickly  as  possible.    Aircraft performance  below  obstacle  clearance  speed  may  not  allow  safe  clearance  of obstacles. 5.17.2.2.2.  When conditions permit, takeoff at Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater. 5.17.2.3.  Landing.  Minimum runway length is ground roll plus 500 ft. 5.17.2.4.  Training: 5.17.2.4.1.  Minimum runway length is 3,000 ft. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   37  5.17.2.4.2.  Compute  landing  performance  with  2  engines  in  reverse,  2  engines  in ground idle, and full brakes.  (T-2) 5.17.2.4.3.  Takeoff speed will be Vmca or Vmeto, whichever is greater. 5.17.2.4.4.  Obstacle  clearance  speed  will  be  actual  maximum  effort  obstacle clearance speed, or 10 knots above takeoff speed, whichever is greater.  (T-2) 5.17.2.4.5.  Simulated obstacle clearance height will not exceed 50 ft.  (T-2) 5.17.2.4.6.  Squadron commanders may authorize the use of actual max effort speeds (takeoff and obstacle clearance) on a case-by-case basis.  (T-3) 5.17.3.  NVG Operations: 5.17.3.1.  NVG  normal  and  short  field  operations  will  be  conducted  IAW  Paragraphs 5.17.1  and  5.17.2,  respectively.    If  the  touchdown  zone  is  greater  than  500  ft,  or unmarked,  minimum WARNING:    On  blacked  out  runways,  a  go-around  point  will  be  identified  to  all  crew members prior to execution.  (T-2) runway ground length 1,000 is roll plus ft.   5.18.  Aircraft Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria. at 5.18.1.  Without  wing walkers, avoid  taxi  obstructions by at least  25 ft; with  wing walkers, by Exception:  Locally based aircraft may taxi within 25 ft of obstacles without a wing walker when fixed taxi routes are marked and the obstruction is permanent, but will still be no closer than  10  ft.    Taxi  routes  must  be  used  by  the  same  model  aircraft  for  which  they  were designed and in the specifically designed parking spots.  Support equipment shall be located in appropriately designated areas.  (T-2) least 10 ft.   5.18.2.  Whenever  taxi  clearance  is  doubtful,  use  a  wing  walker.    If  wing  walkers  are unavailable, deplane a crew member to ensure obstruction clearance.  (T-2) 5.18.3.  Use  low  speed  ground  idle  when  practical.    If  foreign  object  damage  (FOD)  is  a problem, the outboard engines may be shut down provided gross weight, taxiway conditions, brake pressures, and weather are favorable. 5.18.4.  After landing and clearing the runway, with the approval of the pilot, the loadmaster may open the aft cargo door and lower the ramp to approximately 12 inches above horizontal to prepare for cargo offload or onload.  Ensure all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the cargo compartment.  (T-2) 5.18.5.  Pilots  will  be  advised  of  any  known  obstructions  that  exceed  the  shaded  area  in Figure 5.1.  (T-2)   38  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 Figure 5.1.  Ground Operations Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  5.19.  Reverse Taxi. 5.19.1.  The  pilot  will  coordinate  engine  status/utilization  with  the  flight  engineer  and  taxi directions and signals with the loadmaster and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi operations.  (T-2) 5.19.2.  Ensure all passengers are seated and cargo is secure prior to aircraft movement.  (T-2) 5.19.3.  Open  aft  cargo  door  and  lower  the  ramp  to  approximately  12  inches  above horizontal.  (T-2) 5.19.4.  The loadmaster will be on the ramp in a position to provide maximum visibility and direct  reverse  taxi.    Report  any  hazards  and  provide  the  pilot  with  timely  interphone instructions  on  turns,  distance  remaining,  condition  of  the  maneuvering  area  and  stopping point. CAUTION:  If more than three ground loading ramps or three canary slides are installed, at least one will be removed to allow unobstructed vision from the cargo ramp while backing.  During night reverse taxi operations, the pilot and loadmaster will ensure that visibility in the taxi area is sufficient to conduct safe taxi operations.  With or without wing walkers, avoid taxi obstacles by at least 25 ft during night reverse taxi operations.  (T-2)  (T-2)   5.20.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria. 5.20.1.  PICs  will  comply  with  the  ASRR  requirements  prior  to  operating  at  airfields classified as “special PIC airports” or “certification airfields” by the ASRR.  (T-2) 5.20.2.  An  airfield  is  considered  suitable  for  C-130  operations  when  no  obstructions penetrate into the shaded area of Figure  5.2.  This ensures obstruction clearance only if the aircraft is maintained within 35 ft of runway centerline and the angle of bank does not exceed 5°. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   39  5.20.3.  When an obstruction exceeds the shaded area of Figure 5.2, specific approval by the Group Commander/COMAFSOF (for contingency operations) is required and the PIC must be  advised  of  the  height  and  location  of  the  obstruction,  as  well  as  specific  procedures  to avoid the obstacle (i.e., landing beyond the obstacle).  (T-3) Figure 5.2.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  5.21.  Operations Over Arresting Cables. 5.21.1.  Avoid  landing  on  (touching  down  on)  arresting  cables  (does  not  include  recessed cables).  If the aircraft lands on or before the cable, the crew will contact the tower to have the cable inspected.  (T-2) 5.21.2.  Operations  on  runways  where  the  arresting  cable  has  less  than  eight  tie-downs  are authorized when required for mission accomplishment. 5.21.3.  For all  operations over arresting  cables, cross the cable on runway centerline at the minimum  practical  speed  to  minimize  the  potential  for  damage  to  the  aircraft.    Maintain appropriate back pressure on the aircraft yoke during taxi operations to reduce nose landing gear downforce.  (T-2) 5.22.  Buddy  and  Windmill  Taxi  Starts.  Buddy  and  windmill  taxi  starts  may  be  performed when  required  by  the  training  syllabus  or  when  approved  by  the  Group  Commander (COMAFSOF for contingency operations). 5.22.1.  Group  commanders  may  delegate  this  authority  to  their  squadron  or  mission commanders  when  the  unit  is  deployed.    This  authorization  will  not  be  construed  to  allow repeated  buddy  or  windmill  taxi  starts  at  various  scheduled  en  route  stops.    Load  all passengers after completion of a buddy or windmill taxi start.  (T-2) 5.23.  Inter.  Takeoffs will normally be made from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.  The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.  Base TOLD computations on the runway remaining at the point the takeoff is initiated.  (T-2)   40  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 5.24.  Minimum Engine Performance.  Predicted torque will be checked on all AFSOC aircraft prior to the first flight of the day.  If predicted torque for a 95% engine cannot be obtained on all engines,  the  aircraft  will  not  be  flown.    If  this  check  is  not  performed  prior  to  lineup,  a  static takeoff will be performed to confirm torque prior to takeoff roll.  (T-2) 5.24.1.  Request clearance from ground control or tower controller prior to an engine run-up.  At no time will an engine run-up be attempted (throttles out of the ground range) unless the aircraft is in an approved engine run-up site or the active runway.  Ensure the area behind the aircraft Note:  Clearance from either ground or tower does not constitute a safe environment for an engine run.  Advise controller anytime propeller wash will cross the runway.  (T-2) starting engine an is clear before run.   5.25.  Reduced  Power  Operations.  Reduced  power  operations  are  intended  to  prolong  engine service life. 5.25.1.  During  proficiency  flights  (operations  that  are  primarily  confined  to  the  traffic pattern), turbine inlet temperature (TIT) will be at least 900° for takeoff, not to exceed 19,600 inch-pounds (in-lbs) of torque.  (T-2) 5.25.2.  TIT for tactical operations will normally be 970° for takeoff, not to exceed 19,600 in-lbs  of  torque.    Higher  power  settings  may  be  used,  as  required,  and  will  be  briefed  by  the flying pilot.  (T-2) 5.25.3.  Climb  power  to  cruise  altitude  will  be  970°  unless  mission  requirements  dictate otherwise, not to exceed 19,600 in-lbs of torque.  (T-2) 5.25.4.  Use  maximum  power  for  max  effort  takeoffs  (actual  or  simulated),  not  to  exceed 19,600 in-lbs of torque.  (T-2) 5.26.  Three-Engine Takeoffs.  Actual engine-out takeoffs require MAJCOM/A3 (COMAFSOF for contingency operations) approval. 5.27.  Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces.  Aircrews should not attempt to recover an aircraft after inadvertent entry onto surfaces that are not suitable for taxi.  Ground crews using appropriate equipment  will  normally  recover the  aircraft.   Aircrews  may  recover  the  aircraft  at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no aircraft damage and the surface will support the aircraft.  (T-2) 5.28.  Engines  Running  Onload  or  Offload  (ERO).  Do  not  use  ERO  procedures  when explosive  cargo  (hazard  class  1.1-1.4)  is  involved  unless  authorized  by  the  Joint  Airborne/Air Transportability  Training  (JA/ATT)  or  exercise  operation  order  or  contingency  air  tasking orders.  Exception:  Small arms ammunition hazard class 1.4S may be on/offloaded using ERO procedures providing the total net explosive weight (NEW) does not exceed airfield restrictions at the assigned on/offload location. 5.28.1.  The  ERO  procedures  in  this  paragraph  may  be  used  for  any  mix  of  personnel  or cargo.  The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.  The  PIC  will  assess  prevailing  weather,  lighting,  and  parking  location  to  ensure  safe operations.  (T-2) 5.28.2.  General Procedures: AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   41  5.28.2.1.  The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing specific crew member duties.  (T-2) 5.28.2.2.  The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone and radio.  (T-2) 5.28.2.3.  Operate  engines  in  ground  idle  (low  speed,  if  applicable).    If  conditions warrant, open air deflector doors and lower flaps to further reduce propeller blast. 5.28.2.4.  Turn wing leading edge lights on during night EROs.  Taxi lights may be used at the discretion of the pilot.  (T-2) 5.28.2.5.  Complete  passenger  and  cargo  manifests,  crew  lists  and  DD  Form  365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, for the subsequent sortie.  Note  DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty.  (T-2) 5.28.2.6.  Resume taxi after the LM has stated “Cleared to taxi”.  (T-2) 5.28.2.7.  Do  not  onload  or  offload  through  two  different  doors  simultaneously.  WARNING:  Due to the hazards involved (i.e., propeller blast, proximity to engines and propellers, lack of paratroop door steps, etc.), only hand transferable items of cargo may be on/offloaded through the paratroop doors during EROs.  (T-2) 5.28.3.  Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door.  (T-2) 5.28.3.1.  The PIC will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.  (T-2) 5.28.3.2.  During  on/offload,  station  a  crew  member  (normally  the  LM)  on  interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 ft and at a 45° angle from the aircraft axis.  (T-2) 5.28.3.3.  Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.  (T-2) 5.28.4.  Personnel or cargo on/offload through the aft cargo door and ramp. 5.28.4.1.  After  the aircraft  has  slowed  to  taxi  speed,  the LM may remove all tie-downs except  one  forward  and  one  aft  restraint.    Remove  remaining  restraints  only  after  the aircraft  is  stopped  and  vehicle  drivers  are  in  place.    Drivers  will  not  release  vehicle parking brakes until all restraints are removed and cleared to proceed by the LM.  (T-2) 5.28.4.2.  Upon  clearance  from  the  PIC,  open  the  aft  cargo  door  and  lower  the  ramp  to approximately 12 inches above horizontal.  (T-2) 5.28.4.3.  The  LM  will  direct  all  on/offload  operations  using  prebriefed  signals.  Passengers will be escorted by a crew member when enplaning or deplaning.  (T-2) 5.28.4.4.  Other  qualified  LMs  may  direct  the  operation,  if  available,  but  the  crew loadmaster retains overall responsibility for the operation. 5.28.5.  Engine  Running Crew Change (ERCC).  The enplaning crew will not  approach the aircraft until the deplaning LM is in position on headset outside the aircraft.  Keep ERCCs to the absolute minimum necessary to accomplish the mission.

See  AFI  11-301,  Vol  1,  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (AFE)  Program,  for  minimum aircrew clothing requirements.  All aircrew members will have flight gloves readily available during all flights and will wear them for takeoffs, landings, and when operating in a combat environment.  (T-2) 6.1.2.  Crew members will remove rings and scarves before performing aircrew duties.  (T-2) 6.2.  Personal Requirements and Professional Equipment. 6.2.1.  Passports.    Carry  passports  on  missions  when  required  by  the  Foreign  Clearance Guide (FCG). 6.2.2.  Shot  Records.    Aircrew  members  will  ensure  they  meet  immunization  requirements for the mission.  (T-2) 6.2.3.  Identification Tags.  Identification tags should be worn around the neck or carried in a flight suit pocket. 6.2.4.  Restricted Area Badges.  Carry the restricted area badge on all missions (except actual combat missions).  Display the badge only in designated restricted areas.  (T-2) 6.2.5.  Tool and Airdrop Kits.  A tool kit will be on board for all flights.  Individual units will establish requirements for tools to be included in these kits and the crew member responsible for the kit (AFRC aircraft tool kits/aircraft Hostile Environment Repair Kit (HERK) satisfy this requirement).  One LM airdrop kit will be on board for aerial delivery missions.  (T-2) 6.2.6.  Hostile Environment Repair Kit.  One HERK will be on board for all OCONUS and contingency deployment missions.  Units will identify where the HERK will be stored on the aircraft in the local supplement to this AFI.  The flight engineer will ensure the HERK is on board and serviceable (secured) during the aircraft preflight prior to departure.  (T-2) 6.2.7.  Carry a headset, helmet and oxygen mask, and operable flashlight on all flights.  Crew members will not wear wigs, hairpieces, rings, ornaments, pins, clips, other hair fasteners, or earrings Exception:  Plain elastic hair fasteners or plastic barrettes are allowed, providing they do not interfere with the wearing of headsets or helmets, or the donning of oxygen equipment.  All devices will be accounted for before and after flight.  (T-2) aircraft the the flightline.   in or on 6.3.  Aircrew Publications Requirements. 6.3.1.  Publications specified in Table 6.1 will be carried during all ground/flight operations.  (T-2) 6.3.2.  Electronic  Publications  (e-Pubs).    All  electronic  media  will  be  of  equal  or  higher quality  than  paper  versions  and  if  used  will  require  redundant  e-tool  viewing  sources (hardware)  on  board  the  aircraft.    Reference  the  most  current  command  guidance  on electronic flight bags (EFB) for information on regulatory guidance.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   43  6.3.3.  Abbreviated  checklists,  approach/departures  plates,  standard  instrument  departure (SID), and standard terminal arrival route (STAR) publications will remain in paper format unless an approved e-tool device is authorized.  FLIP may also be viewed/utilized inflight via an approved e-tools device.  (T-2) 6.3.4.  Operations Group Stan/Eval (OG/OGV) will develop procedures and standards for the  e-Pubs program.  At a minimum, procedures will address a data backup plan at the OG/OGV level  for  the  master  publications  file.    For  this  purpose,  utilize  three  separate  data  media storage devices (e.g., CD-ROM, hard drive, and local area network drive).  If at all feasible, these data sources should be physically separated from each other in the event of catastrophic failure  (e.g.,  fire,  tornado,  etc.).    Additionally,  OG/OGVs  will  develop  a  plan  to  obtain  the most  current  publications  and  aircrew  members  will  update  their  publications  at  least monthly  and  prior  to  performing  flight  duties.    OG/OGVs  will  also  develop  a  method  by which read-only publications will be provided to the end user/aircrew and the timing of and process  by  which  supplements  to  each  publication  will  be  posted.    This  method  will  also include  procedures  for  maintaining  electronic  and  paper  publications  concurrently,  if appropriate.    Each  level  (MAJCOM,  Group,  and  Squadron)  will  be  responsible  for  posting their  particular  supplements  to  publications;  ultimately,  the  end  user  still  bears  the responsibility  for  properly  posted  publications  in  either  electronic  or  paper  format.    Lastly, OG/OGVs will establish procedures for inflight use focusing on accessibility and reliability of  information.    In  this  regard,  OG/OGVs  are  encouraged  to  restrict  data  source  types  to ensure  hardware  capability  in  all  crew  positions.    OG/OGVs  will  publish  additional restrictions  as  necessary  to  ensure  the  e-Pubs  program  does  not  require  a  greater  workload inflight than the current model of paper products.  (T-2) 6.3.4.1.  Electronic  copies  (CD-ROM,  flash  media,  etc.)  of  unit  publications  library  are acceptable  for  deployments  with  appropriate  equipment/software  to  view  publications.  Ensure  all  copies  are  up-to-date  and  publications  not  available  electronically  are  to  be maintained in paper format.  Appropriate equipment to view these files must be available.

(T-2) 6.7.1.  The base COMSEC custodian has access to the AFKAG 44/AFKAG 14 and can assist in  obtaining  the  material  required  for  the  mission.    Squadrons  maintain  the  COMSEC material  used  on  most  missions.    All  squadron  members  that  require  access  to  COMSEC material  will  be  properly  trained.    Base/squadron  COMSEC  Responsible  Officer  (CRO)  is the point of contact (POC) for current training requirements.  (T-2) 6.7.2.  Command  and  Control  Centers  (CCC)  will  provide temporary  storage  for COMSEC/classified  materials  during  ground  time  at  en  route  stops.    Issue  and  turn-in  of AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   47  COMSEC  is  normally  a  function  of  the  squadron  CRO.    At  locations  where  no  storage facilities exist, classified materials may be stored in the aircraft safe, if available.  (T-2) 6.7.2.1.  Remove  classified/sensitive  information  (such  as  secure  voice/DAMA,  IFF, mission information) stored in all aircraft systems.  (T-2) 6.7.3.  In the event of an emergency, destroy classified material and equipment prior to crash landing or bailout, if possible. 6.8.  Briefing  Requirements.  Refer  to  the  appropriate  AFSOC  briefing  guides  for  content.  Crew  members  will  not  fly  unless  they  attend  the  crew  briefings  for  their  mission.   Exception:    When  pre-mission  requirements  dictate,  PIC  may  excuse  certain  crew  members from the briefing.  The PIC will ensure that those personnel receive a face-to-face briefing prior to engine start.  (T-2) 6.9.  Checklists.  Aircrews  must  be  familiar  with  notes,  warnings,  and  cautions  without  direct reference to the TO.  (T-2) 6.9.1.  The  only  pages  (or  inserts)  authorized  in  checklist  binders  are  C-130  series  TO aircrew  checklists,  AFSOC-approved  checklists,  briefing  guides,  and  unit-approved information  guides.    Units  may  construct  locally  approved  inflight  guides  using  AF  Form 4124, Flight Crew Information Guide.  (T-2) 6.9.2.  Any  personal  notes  on  checklists,  briefings,  or  information  guides  must  be  current.  (T-2) 6.9.3.  Abbreviated checklist items that do not apply to unit aircraft or mission may be lined out.  (T-2) 6.9.4.  The FE may read all checklists. 6.10.  Call  Signs.

(T-2) 6.10.2.  Search  and  Rescue  (SAR).    When  tasked  to  participate  in  SAR  operations,  use  the call sign "AIR FORCE RESCUE" plus the last five digits of the aircraft tail number.  (T-2) 6.11.  AFTO  Form  781.  Review the AFTO Form 781 before applying power to the aircraft or operating  aircraft  systems.    The  exceptional  release  (ER)  must  be  signed  before  flight.    A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the ER.  If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER.  Ensure that the DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identiplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft.  (T-2) 6.12.  One-Time  Flights.  Refer to TO 00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures, for downgrade authority and procedures. 6.12.1.  One-time  flight  approval  authority  is  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF.    (T-3)    The  owning Maintenance  Group  (MXG)/CC  (or  designated  official),  the  senior  maintenance  officer,  or the  on-site  chief  of  an  AFMC  repair  team  must  first  authorize  the  release.    (T-2)        PIC concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.  (T-2)   48  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 6.13.  Dash One Preflight.  The aircrew Dash One preflight inspection, once completed, is valid for  72  hours  provided  the  aircraft  is  sealed,  or  continuously  monitored  by  squadron  personnel.  (T-2) 6.13.1.  When  an  aircrew  assumes  a  preflighted  spare  or  quick-turn,  a  thorough  visual inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or servicing.  (T-2) 6.13.2.  Dash  One  preflight  inspections  are  normally  done  in  preparation  for  flight  by  the aircrew assigned to fly the mission designated for that aircraft, that day. 6.13.2.1.  The  following  guidelines  apply  to  aircrew  assigned  to  preflight  and/or  seal aircraft.  A crew will not preflight more than four aircraft in a 12-hour period.  Refer to crew  rest/flight  duty  period  guidance  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    Aircrews  performing preflight duties will be afforded 12hours rest between preflight shifts.  (T-2) 6.13.2.2.  Duties  not  involving  flying  (DNIF)  crew  members  may  accomplish  preflights with the concurrence of the flight surgeon.  It is the responsibility of the crew member to know his/her duty limitations.  Crew members should have the flight surgeon document the  AF  Form  1042,  Medical  Recommendations for  Flying  or  Special  Operational Duty, appropriately IAW with AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. 6.14.  Alert Aircraft Procedures.  Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows:  (T-2) 6.14.1.  Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff. 6.14.2.  Aircraft  preflight  times  should  align  the  alert  period  and  aircraft  preflight  validity period, eliminating the need to update the preflight during the alert period. 6.14.3.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are met: 6.14.3.1.  Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet alert commitments. 6.14.3.2.  Maintain communications with the primary controlling agency. 6.14.3.3.  If  maintenance  actions  are  not  required,  the  aircraft  can  be  resealed  for  alert once  the  THRU-FLIGHT  inspection  is  completed.    In  all  cases,  a  new  preflight  is  not required until the end of the initial preflight period. 6.14.4.  A  DD  Form  365-4  should  be  prepared  for  the  alert  aircraft,  when  practical.    Alert crews  are  authorized  to  prepare  a  TOLD  card  using  the  worst  weather  conditions  expected for the alert period.  Use the TOLD for alert scrambles.  If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD for the existing weather conditions. 6.14.5.  If  the  alert  aircraft  is  changed  to  a  different  preflighted/sealed  aircraft,  or  an  alert crew change occurs and the same aircraft remains on alert, the preflight or alert crew will, at a minimum, apply power to the aircraft and check the following systems (as applicable): 6.14.5.1.  AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document. 6.14.5.2.  Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment. 6.14.5.3.  Fuel quantity. 6.14.5.4.  Survival and emergency equipment. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   49  6.14.5.5.  Navigation and communication equipment. 6.14.5.6.  Liquid oxygen quantity. 6.14.5.7.  Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges. 6.14.5.8.  Publications. 6.14.6.  Should an aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, a complete aircrew Dash One preflight is then required. 6.14.7.  Once the aircraft is accepted for alert, the flight engineer will ensure an entry is made in  the  AFTO  Form  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Report  and  Maintenance  Document, stating, at a minimum, the date and time the aircraft was preflighted. 6.14.8.  Alert  aircraft  are  off  limits  to  all  personnel  except  alert  crew  members.    No maintenance  may  be  performed  on  the  aircraft  without  the  approval  of  the  unit/mission commander.  Upon receiving orders to launch, the crew is required to check the area in which maintenance was performed prior to flight. 6.15.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. 6.15.1.  Aircraft Refueling.  Crew members may perform refueling duties at austere locations or at stations without maintenance support.  Aircrews should not refuel except in cases when maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. 6.15.2.  Concurrent Ground Operations.  Simultaneous aircraft refueling/defueling and cargo loading or maintenance operations is authorized in accordance with TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding.  Refueling or defueling with passengers or patients on board is only authorized for aeromedical evacuation missions.  (T-2) 6.15.3.  Liquid Oxygen (LOX) Servicing.  Under no conditions are crew members allowed to service liquid oxygen.  (T-2) 6.15.4.  Forward  Area  Refueling  Point  Operations.    Refer  to  AFI  11-235,  Forward  Area Refueling Point (FARP) Operations. 6.15.5.  Fire Protection, Ground Operations and Crash Rescue. 6.15.5.1.  The aircraft engine fire extinguisher system fulfills the minimum requirements for fire protection during engine start.  If available, position a portable fire extinguisher for added fire protection.  (T-2) 6.15.5.2.  A fireguard is required for all engine starts.  In the absence of additional ground personnel, the LM or ground controller may act as fireguard.  (T-2) 6.15.6.  Propulsion System Checks (Engine Runs).  When conducting maintenance-requested propulsion system checks, comply with the following:  (T-2) 6.15.6.1.  Prior  to  conducting  the  checks,  complete  an  operational  risk  management (ORM) assessment and review risk mitigation actions.  The minimum crew complement for  the  checks  will  be  the  crew  complement  required  for  aircraft  taxi.    Start  with  the preflight  checklist  and  accomplish  all  checklists  through  BEFORE  LEAVING  THE AIRCRAFT checklist.   50  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 6.15.6.2.  During the propulsion system checks, follow normal flight manual procedures and limitations (do not combine maintenance procedures/limitations into the checks).  Set power as requested and relay instrument readings, but limit troubleshooting to the scope of the aircraft flight manual.  Checks requiring functional check flight (FCF) procedures will be performed by FCF-qualified crews. 6.15.6.3.  When conducting propulsion system checks in areas of reduced traction, ensure all personnel on board are seated with lap belts fastened. 6.15.7.  Towing.  Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations.  The PIC  will  coordinate  with  the  senior  maintenance  officer  or  superintendent  to  ensure  the towing  supervisor  and  crew  are  qualified.    At  non-USAF  installations,  the  PIC  must  have approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing.  The PIC will ensure the  tow  team  supervisor  briefs  all  personnel  on  their  duties  and  the  associated  hazards.  Proper  checklists  will  be  used.    If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  the  qualification  of  tow  team personnel  or  the  safety of  the  operation,  make  no  attempt  to  tow  the  aircraft  until qualified Air  Force  personnel  can  be  located.    Under  no  circumstances  will  any  crew  member  act  as the towing supervisor.  (T-2) 6.15.8.  When  thunderstorms  are  reported  within  10  nm  of  the  airfield,  only  operations leading to an immediate engine start and departure may continue.  However, personnel must be  prepared  to  cease  all  activities  in  the  event  lightning  within  5  nm  is  declared.    When advised  of  lightning  within  5  nm  of  the  airfield,  all  flightline  activities  will  cease  and personnel will seek shelter.  (T-2). 6.15.9.  Aircraft  taxiing  to  parking  or  hot  cargo  when  lightning  is  declared  within  5  nm should  not  expect  a  marshaller.    The  aircrew  will  hold  in  place  or  proceed  to  parking  if clearance  is  assured.    Remain  in  the  aircraft  if  ground  transportation  cannot  be  arranged.  Time permitting, coordinate with Base Operations if the aircraft will be parked in a location other than one assigned.  (T-2) 6.16.  Aircrew Flight Equipment and Oxygen Requirements. 6.16.1.  The  PIC  or  designated  representative  will  ensure  appropriate  serviceable  protective clothing, aircrew flight equipment, survival equipment, and Dash 21 equipment for the entire mission are available prior to flight and all personnel are briefed or trained in their use prior to departing home station.  (T-2) 6.16.1.1.  Prior to departing home station and following en route crew changes, the PIC or  designated  representative  will  review  the  AFTO  Form  46,  Prepositioned  Aircrew Flight Equipment, to ensure all required equipment is on board and required inspections have  been  completed.    The  PIC  or  designated  crew  member  will  document  and  ensure missing aircrew flight equipment is annotated in both the AFTO Form 781A and AFTO Form 46.  (T-2) 6.16.2.  Oxygen.    Oxygen  on  board  for  takeoff  will  be  a  minimum  of  5  liters.    On  aircraft with two LOX systems, if a system is operational it must contain a minimum of 5 liters.

Aircraft  transporting  Division  1.1  and  1.2  explosives,  nuclear weapons, and Hazardous Materials requiring a special assignment airlift mission (SAAM),  i.e.,  Toxic  Chemical  Ammunition,  are  normally  parked  at  remote  (hot cargo) spots. 6.42.2.5.2.2.  Division  1.3  and  1.4  explosives  may  or  may  not  require  hot  cargo parking depending on quantity of explosives. 6.42.2.5.2.3.  Transient  aircraft  with  explosives,  when  cargo  is  not  handled,  may be parked at isolated locations other than hot cargo spots. 6.42.2.5.2.4.  Other  hazardous  materials  normally  do  not  require  remote  or isolated parking. 6.42.2.5.2.5.  Military  installations  are  responsible  for  proper  placarding  of aircraft. 6.43.  Hazardous Medical Equipment. 6.43.1.  Nonstandard  equipment  possessed  by  medical  facilities  that  use  AFSOC  air evacuation  services  should  be  regarded  as  potentially  hazardous.    Two  types  of  equipment are of major concern: AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   63  6.43.1.1.  Electronic  medical  equipment  produces  electromagnetic  interference  (EMI) which  is  commonly  beyond  the  limits  specified  by  Military  Standard  (MILSTD)  461A and  462,  and  therefore  can  interfere  with  aircraft  communication  and  navigational equipment. 6.43.1.2.  Therapeutic  oxygen  systems  present  an  increased  hazard  of  fire  or  explosion.  A  potential  hazard  is  the  inadvertent  disruption  of  the  cylinder  neck,  manifold,  or regulator resulting in explosion and propulsion of the container or accessories. 6.43.2.  For nonstandard electronic medical equipment, take the following precautions: 6.43.2.1.  Medical  personnel  must  inform  the  PIC  when  nonstandard  electronic  medical equipment is brought on board the aircraft.  (T-2) 6.43.2.2.  The  PIC  must  be  informed  of  the  anticipated  period  of  use  of  the  equipment during the mission.  (T-2) 6.43.2.3.  The  PIC  must  be  alert  for  any  interference  with  aircraft  communications  or navigation equipment during periods of use of this equipment.  (T-2) 6.43.2.4.  When  continuous  use  of  the  equipment  is  required  throughout  the  duration  of the  mission,  flight  must  be  restricted  to  VFR  conditions.    Furthermore,  exercise additional  caution  on  night  VFR  missions  to  ensure  there  are  no  adverse  effects  on navigational equipment.  (T-2) 6.43.3.  For nonstandard oxygen equipment, take the following precautions:  (T-2) 6.43.3.1.  All  compressed  oxygen  equipment  with  exposed,  unprotected  cylinder  neck, manifold, or regulator must be completely secured from all movement in its longitudinal and lateral axes. 6.43.3.2.  Medical personnel must continually monitor the operation of the equipment to detect possible malfunction during exposure to altitude.  (T-2) 6.43.4.  Mission capable parts (MICAP), very, very important parts (VVIP), sensitive cargo, courier materials, and registered mail moving within the normal airlift system are receipted at the  onload  and  offload  stations  using  the  air  cargo  manifest.    For  unit  moves  operated  in accordance  with  Defense  Transportation  Regulation  (DTR),  Part  III,  Mobility,  classified  or sensitive  cargo  movement  is  normally  manifested  utilizing  the  DD  Form  2130-2,  C-130A/B/E/H Load Plan, or similar automated product (such as CALM or AALPS), and will normally be accompanied by a unit courier.  (T-2)  However, if classified/sensitive unit cargo is  offered  without  an  accompanying  courier,  the  DD  Form  1907,  Signature  Tally  Record, must be used.  (T-2) 6.43.4.1.  Defense  Courier  Service  (DCS).    Couriers  coordinating  with  the  PIC  are authorized  to  designate  officer  or  enlisted  (E-5  and  above)  crew  members  on  military aircraft  as  couriers  to  escort  and  safeguard  courier  material  when  other  qualified personnel  are  not  available.    Qualified  passengers,  if  carried,  are  designated  before designating crew members.  The following restrictions apply:  (T-2) 6.43.4.1.1.  Primary crew members will not be designated couriers without the PIC’s consent.   64  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 6.43.4.1.2.  Crew members on aircraft scheduled to make an extended en route stop at a location where DCS couriers cannot provide en route support will not be designated as couriers. 6.43.4.2.  During stops at en route locations supported by DCS stations, DCS couriers are required to meet designated couriers, guard and protect the material.  (T-2) 6.43.4.2.1.  During  unscheduled  en  route  stops  crew  members  may  place  courier material  in  temporary  custody  of  the  following  agencies  in  descending  order  of priority.  (T-2) 6.43.4.2.1.1.  DCS courier. 6.43.4.2.1.2.  TOP SECRET control officer of the US armed forces. 6.43.4.2.1.3.  US Department of State Diplomatic Courier. 6.43.4.2.1.4.  US Department of State activity. 6.43.4.2.1.5.  US military guards. 6.43.4.2.1.6.  US DOD civilian guards. 6.43.4.3.  If  unable  to  follow  the  itinerary  to  the  destination  of  the  courier  material,  or material  is  lost,  stolen,  or  otherwise  compromised,  report  circumstances  to  the  nearest Defense Courier Station and notify the local US military commander or US Government activity.  (T-2) 6.43.4.4.  Life or death urgency shipments consist of biological or other medical supplies of such urgency that human life is dependent upon immediate receipt.  Shipments will be manifested  separately  and  the  manifest  annotated  with  the  words  “LIFE  OR  DEATH URGENCY”.  All shipments will be handled on a hand-to-hand receipt basis, using either the air cargo manifest or the DD Form 1907 for unit moves.  The PIC will be briefed on the urgency of the shipment and be made the custodian during flight.  (T-2) 6.44.  Border Clearance. 6.44.1.  Normal Operations:  (T-2) 6.44.1.1.  Border Clearance Requirements.  The requirements will be IAW the applicable Foreign  Clearance  Guide  and  AFI  24-203,  Preparation  and  Movement  of  Air  Force Cargo. 6.44.1.2.  Pilot In Command Responsibility.  Border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC,  although  many  of  the  duties  have  been  assigned  to  ground  personnel  and  to  the loadmaster.  The PIC will ensure: 6.44.1.3.  Crew  members  and  passengers  possess  current  passports  and  valid  visas,  if required. 6.44.1.4.  Crew  members  and  passengers  have  current  shot  records  or  certificates  of immunization. 6.44.1.5.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order. 6.44.1.6.  Departure or arrival to the US is through a port of entry where border clearance can be obtained. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   65  6.44.1.7.  Border clearance for aircraft cargo, passengers, crew and baggage, if required, is obtained before takeoff to a foreign area, or after arrival from a foreign area. 6.44.1.8.  Aircraft spraying is accomplished, if required (see Paragraph 6.52). 6.44.1.9.  En  route  to  the  US,  the  loadmaster  has  distributed  personal  customs declarations  to  all  passengers  and  crew  members,  has  briefed  passengers  and  crew members  on  customs  regulations,  and  has  prepared  and  compiled  necessary  border clearance forms for PIC signature. 6.44.1.10.  En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change in ETA to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing. 6.44.1.11.  A  Permit  to  Proceed,  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP)  Form  1400, Record  of  Vessels  Engaged  in  Foreign  Trade  Entered  or  Arrived  Under  Permit  to Proceed, or CBP Form 1401, Record of Vessels Engaged in Foreign Trade Cleared and Granted Permit to Proceed, is obtained when the mission requires an aircraft, which has landed in the US for customs clearance, to proceed to another US base to obtain border clearance.    The  permit  delays  customs  inspection  of  cargo,  passengers,  and  crew  until arrival  at  the  offload  station,  saving  intermediate  offloading  and  reloading  normally required  for  customs  inspection.    The  Permit  to  Proceed  is  valid  only  to  the  airport  of next  landing, where  the border  clearance must  be completed, or  a new permit obtained.  Do not make intermediate stops unless required by an emergency situation or directed by C2 authority. 6.44.1.12.  When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US customs representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents.  Do not deplane passengers or  crew  members,  except  a  scanner,  unless  necessary  for  safety.    Do  not  unload  until approved by customs and agriculture personnel or their designated representatives.  This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all subsequent landings until crew, passengers, and cargo complete final border clearance. 6.44.2.  Exercise and Contingency Operations.  (T-2) 6.44.2.1.  General.  Certain missions, which do not transit normal ports of entry or exit, require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health, immigration,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding (MOU) establishes procedures and waivers. 6.44.2.2.  Implementation.  Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the  agreement  as  necessary  for  each  operation.    Inspection  and  clearance  may  be accomplished at the CONUS onload or offload base instead of the normal port of entry, or at the foreign onload or offload base. 6.45.  Customs Procedures. 6.45.1.  Outbound.  No requirements.  Filing of a CBP 7507, is waived.  (T-2) 6.45.2.  Inbound.  Prepare one copy of the following documents before arrival.  (T-2) 6.45.2.1.  CBP 7507 (passenger list not required). 6.45.2.2.  Cargo manifest.   66  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 6.45.2.3.  For troops out of country less than 140 days. 6.45.2.3.1.  Troop commander’s certificate from examination of troop baggage. 6.45.2.3.2.  One  copy  of  CBP  6059B,  Customs  Declaration,  for  each  passenger  not under  command  of  the  troop  commander,  to  include  observers,  support  personnel, civilians, news reporters, and crew members. 6.45.2.3.3.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  Customs  representative  meets the  aircraft  and  accepts  the  troop  commander's  certificate  with  respect  to  troop baggage.    Individual  baggage  declarations  are  not  required.    The  troop  commander should  have  inspected  troop  baggage.    Troops  debark  under  the  observation  of  the Customs representative with only a spot check of articles and baggage.  The Customs officer may elect to make a more extensive inspection. 6.45.2.4.  For troops out of the country 140 days or more.  (T-2) 6.45.2.4.1.  One  copy  of  CBP  6059B  for  each  passenger.    This  includes  observers, support personnel, civilians, news media personnel, and crew members. 6.45.2.4.2.  Upon  arrival  at  a  CONUS  offload  base,  a  Customs  representative  meets the aircraft and collects all declarations.  Troops debark under the observation of the Customs representative, who may make discretionary examination of the baggage. 6.46.  Immigration Procedures. 6.46.1.  Outbound.  No requirements. 6.46.2.  Inbound.  Submit one copy of CBP 7507 to the Immigration inspector.  (T-2) 6.47.  Customs, Immigration and Agricultural Inspections. 6.47.1.  Obtain Customs, Immigration, Agriculture, and Public Health clearance, as required, prior  to  opening  any  doors,  hatches,  or  windows,  other  than  the  crew  entrance  door,  or enplaning and deplaning personnel.  (T-2) 6.47.2.  Proceed  directly  from  the  aircraft  to  Customs,  Immigration,  or  Agricultural inspection for processing when required by the inspector.  (T-2) 6.47.3.  US  military  aircraft  are  sovereign  territory.    When  cleared  to  overfly  or  land  in foreign  territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges and  immunities  which  customarily  are  accorded  to  warships.    These  privileges  and immunities include, in the absence of stipulations to the contrary, exemption from duties and taxation,  immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment,  or  cargo  on  board.    The  PIC  will  not  authorize  search,  seizure,  inspection  or similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.  (T-2) 6.47.3.1.  The  PIC  will  not  permit  the  inspection  of  their  aircraft  by  officials  of  any foreign government.  If requested to submit to these actions, the PIC and crew will deny access to the aircraft and seek aid from the senior AFSOC (or other USAF) representative in the US Embassy or Consulate within the host nation.  Customs or other officials will be informed of the above policy and requested to confirm their request through their own AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   67  government and with US Department of State representatives.  If necessary, the crew will seal the aircraft, the crew entered into crew rest, and departure intentions will be canceled until resolution of the matter by the appropriate authority.  Inform C2 authorities by the fastest available means should this situation occur.  (T-2) 6.47.3.2.  When confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews should consider the following procedures:  (T-2) 6.47.3.2.1.  In  most  cases,  search  attempts  may  be  stopped  by  a  statement  to  the foreign  officials  that  the  aircraft  is  sovereign  and  not  subject  to  search  without consent  of  USAF  or  the  chief  of  mission  in  the  country  concerned.    This  should  be clearly conveyed  in a polite manner so as not to offend foreign  authorities that may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. 6.47.3.2.2.  If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate to  delay  the  search  until  contact  is  made  with  AF/A3OOA  or  the  appropriate embassy.  The PIC should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent to  the  search  and  that  they  must  relay  the  host  nation  request  to  these  agencies  for decision.    The  PIC  should  then  notify  these  agencies  of  the  request  by  the  most expeditious means available.  Thereafter, the PIC should follow instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and USAF. 6.47.3.2.3.  If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should indicate  that  they  would  prefer  to  fly  the  aircraft  elsewhere  (provided  fuel  and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 6.47.3.2.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way  on  board  an aircraft,  the  PIC  should  state  that  they  protest  the  course  of  action being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and  USAF  of  the  foreign  action.    The  PIC  should  then  allow  the  foreign  agents  on board  the  aircraft,  without  physical  resistance,  and  thereafter  report  the  incident  to USAF and appropriate embassy, as soon as possible. 6.47.3.3.  In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo or equipment.  These instructions and applicable provisions of classified supplements to the FCG should be followed, where applicable. 6.48.  Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program: 6.48.1.  The  military  customs  program  outlined  in  DTR  4500-9-R  Part  5,  Department  of Defense  Customs  and  Border  Clearance  Policies  and  Procedures,  was  developed  to  assist the  DOD  and  other  US  Government  agencies  in  the  control  of  narcotics,  contraband,  and prohibited  agricultural  products,  and  to  expedite  entry  of  DOD  personnel  and  material  into the customs territory of the United States. 6.48.2.  Military  Customs  Inspectors  will  accomplish  this  inspection  immediately  prior  to departure  and  may  conduct  more  than  one  preclearance  inspection  on  CONUS-bound aircraft.    When  security  considerations  necessitate  deviation  from  this  policy,  mission planners  must  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  agency  to  ensure  the  mission  is  not jeopardized.  (T-2) 6.49.  Insect and Pest Control (Aircraft Spraying).   68  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 6.49.1.  The PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished (if applicable), and certify the spraying on required forms.  (T-2) 6.49.2.  Aerosol normally is dispersed at a flow rate of 10 seconds per 1,000 cubic ft.  Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.  Do not spray any plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it.  (T-2) 6.49.3.  Spray  spaces  inaccessible  from  within  the  aircraft  after  completely  loading  fuel, baggage,  cargo,  and  passengers,  including  baggage  compartments,  wheel  wells,  and  other similar spaces.  (T-2) 6.49.4.  Spray the cabin, cockpit, and other spaces accessible from within the aircraft after the crew is on board and after closing all doors, windows, hatches, and ventilation openings.  (T-2)   CAUTION:  If the insecticide label directs disembarkation after use, spray prior to boarding crew or passengers.  Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board. 6.49.5.  Spray  for  50  seconds  unless  longer  periods  are  specified  for  the  country  being transited.  (T-2) 6.49.6.  When  seeing  any  insect  or  rodent  infestation  of  the  aircraft  inflight,  notify  the destination  CCC,  base  operations,  or  airport  manager  of  the  situation  before  landing  so  the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.  (T-2) 6.49.7.  Upon  arrival,  do  not  open  cargo  doors  or  hatches  except  to  enplane  officials inspecting  the  aircraft  for  insect  or  rodent  infestation.    Do  not  onload  or  offload  until  the inspection  is  satisfactorily  completed.    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.

AFSOC  MC-130  aircraft  are  Protection  Level  "3"  resources  IAW  AFI  31-101, Integrated  Defense.    This  security  priority  designation  applies  to  operational  aircraft,  wherever they  are  located,  worldwide.    Some  aircraft  contain  equipment  and  documents  that  require protection  per  DoD  5200.01,  Vol  3,  DOD  Information  Security  Program:    Protection  of Classified Information, and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management. 7.2.  Procedures.  The  Wg/CC  or  OG/CC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their aircraft  when  located  away  from  home  station.    The  Sq/CC  or  Mission/CC  will  ensure  the PIC/MC receives an aircraft security recommendation from the local threat working group or a suitable  source  and  ensure  the  Wg/CC  or  OG/CC  is  aware  of  any  aircraft  security  issues.    Air Force  Joint  Instruction  (AFJI)  31-102,  Physical  Security,  covers  security  arrangements  when USAF aircraft are located on other DOD  installations.  Arrangements must be made to protect the aircraft during crew rest status at non-US protected locations.  If US military security forces are not available, the US embassy assigned to that country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made.  For missions involving a planning agency, the agency must coordinate with the SOG/CC or designated official (authority may not be delegated lower than the MC) to ensure the planned security measures conform to mission requirements.  The amount of security required will vary depending on location and ground time.  (T-3) 7.2.1.  For  nonpermissive  or  uncertain  environments,  airfield  and  LZ  security  is  the responsibility  of  the  agency  requesting  the  airlift.    Aircrews  will  work  with  the  agency requesting the airlift to ensure security meets the requirement for the mission.  (T-3) 7.2.2.  For  permissive  environments,  PIC/MC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates  en  route,  if  required.    When  landing  at  a  DOD  component  installation,  the installation  commander  is  responsible  to  provide  adequate  security  for  the  aircraft.    The PIC/MC  will  determine  if  security  is  adequate.    Planning  agencies  and  PIC/MC  will  use Table 7.1 to help assess the risk to parked aircraft for planned overnight stops located at non US Note:  Aircrews do possess the training to provide the appropriate security when present at the aircraft.  For unscheduled or emergency landings at non USAF installations, PIC/MC will assess  the  aircraft  security  situation  and  take  the  following  actions,  if  force  protection capability appears insufficient:  (T-3) installation overseas military and civilian airfields.   7.2.2.1.  Aircrew  surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrews  are capable of maintaining appropriate aircraft security.  The PIC/MC will direct armed crew members  to  remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and activities in the aircraft vicinity.  (T-3) 7.2.2.2.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include backup  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15.  (T-3)   70  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 7.2.2.3.  Departure  without  Crew  Rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable,  the  PIC/MC  may  waive  flight  duty  period  (FDP)  restrictions  and  depart  as soon as possible for a destination with adequate force protection.  If unable to depart the location  due  to  system  malfunction,  the  aircrew  must  secure  the  aircraft  to  the  best  of their  ability.    In  no  case,  will  the  entire  crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    Crew  rest requirements  will  be  subordinate  to  aircraft  security  when  the  airframe  may  be  at  risk.  The PIC/MC should rotate a security detail among the crew to  provide for both aircraft protection and crew rest until relief is available.  PIC/MC will coordinate through home station channels to acquire additional security.  (T-3) 7.2.3.  Tailored Security Measures.  Standard physical security measures may be impractical at  times  due  to  mission,  terrain,  climate,  sociopolitical  sensitivities,  or  other  factors.    For example,  some  countries  don't  allow  armed  security  personnel.    On  other  deployments,  the mission  may  rely  on  maintaining  a  low  profile  and  attracting  as  little  attention  as  possible.  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary.  At a minimum, lock aircraft entry points and hatches.  If it is not possible to lock aircraft, secure aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry, i.e., taping hatch release  handles  or  using  seals.    The  PIC/MC  is  the  final  authority  for  determining  tailored security  measures.    Contact  with  US  Embassy  personnel  is  required  at  locations  where security agreements are not in existence.  (T-3) 7.2.4.  Ground  security  teams.    Ground  security  teams  may  be  considered  to  guard  the aircraft for planned overnight stops.  Teams may travel in MEP status and are responsible to the PIC/MC at all times.  The PIC/MC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate.  The squadron commander is the  final  approval  authority  for  the  need  of  ground  security  teams  for  their  aircraft  and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC/MC.  (T-3) 7.2.4.1.  Ground  security  teams  will  comply  with  AFMAN  24-204  at  all  times  when carrying weapons, ammo, and equipment on board the aircraft.  (T-3) 7.2.4.2.  Due  to  the  sensitivity  of  weapons  in  foreign  countries,  ground  security  teams will  keep  their  weapons  inside the  aircraft  and  out-of-sight  of  foreign  nationals,  even  if the  FCG  allows  them  to  be  carried  outside  the  aircraft.    (T-3)    If  a  destination  requires weapons  be  carried  outside  the  aircraft,  the  controlling  MAJCOM  must  approve  such action prior to deployment.  (T-2) 7.2.5.  Unauthorized entry.  If, in the PIC/MC’s judgment, the aircraft needs to be locked and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry:  (T-3) 7.2.5.1.  Use Note:  The aircraft should be locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight. aircraft lock. the  (T-3)      7.2.5.2.  If the aircraft lock is unavailable comply with Paragraph 7.2.3.  Close and seal the  main  crew  entrance  door  using  a  metal  boxcar  seal  or  other  controllable  device  to identify forced entry.  Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry.  If the seals are damaged or have been tampered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.  (T-3) 7.2.5.3.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   71  will  be  left  with  base  operations  or  the  representative  for  servicing  and  maintenance personnel.  (T-3) 7.2.6.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  During  preflight  activities,  aircrews  will  inspect  accessible  areas,  to  include  aircraft  wheel wells,  air-conditioning  compartments,  and  cargo  compartment  for  unauthorized  packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices.  Report any suspicious items to host security forces.  Aircrews  will  maintain  a  heightened  security  posture  throughout  all  pre-takeoff  activities.  (T-3) 7.3.  Aircraft Security Recommendation Matrix.  Planning agencies and the PIC/MC will use this  matrix    IAW  AFI  31-101  to  help  assess  the  risk  to  parked  aircraft  in  a  permissive environment  (see  Table  7.1).    This  matrix  will  be  used  for  planned  overnight  stops  at  non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.  A cumulative score of 20 or below implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate and fly-away security is normally not recommended.  Commanders may consider additional security measures.  If the cumulative score  is  greater  than  21,  a  fly-away  security  team  is  normally  recommended  and  commanders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel.   IAW AFI 31-101 the SOG/CC or designated  official  must  approve  any  tailored  security  measures  and  is  the  final  approval authority for aircraft security issues.  Authority may be delegated no lower than the MC.  (T-3)  Exception:  For unscheduled or emergency landings at unplanned airfields, the PIC will assess the  aircraft  security  situation  and  take  actions  as  needed.    If  the  aircrew  is  not  capable  of providing adequate security, the PIC will request/coordinate security through available channels and  notify  the  respective  air  operations  center  (AOC)  as  soon  as  possible.    The  PIC  should contact  the  US  Embassy  or  US  Defense  Attaché  Officer  (DAO)  for  security  assistance.    (T-2)   Note:  Normally, additional security for the aircraft is not required at military installations within a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) country or US civilian airfields approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

Protective  Standards  for  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors.  This  paragraph applies  specifically  to  aircraft transporting  DV Code  4  or  above.    PIC/MCs  are responsible  for aircraft security at en route stops. 7.4.1.  DOD Installations.  Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure times.    Request  continuous  security  surveillance  during  the  entire  ground  time.    If  the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.  (T-3) 7.4.2.  Non-DOD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange for force protection.  If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15.  (T-3) 7.5.  Arming of Crew Members.  When directed, at least one crew member each from the flight deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and AFMAN 31-229, USAF Weapons Handling Manual.  (T-3) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   75  7.5.1.  Weapons Issue.  Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain weapons, ammunition, lock, and key.  Crew members must present a current AF Form 523, USAF  Authorization  to  Bear  Firearms,  to  be  issued  a  weapon.    Crew  members  will  be reissued  the  same  weapon  until  the  mission  terminates  at  home  station.    If  an  armed  crew member  must  leave  the  crew  en  route,  transfer  the  weapon  to  another  authorized  crew member, using AF Form 1297.  (T-3) 7.5.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels/facilities if available.  To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the weapon on a flat surface.  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.  (T-3) 7.5.3.  Wearing  of Weapons.  When arming  for anti-hijacking  purposes, wear  weapons in  a holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity of armed crew members.  Do not wear weapons  off  the  flightline,  except  to  and  from  the  CCC,  armories,  and  other  facilities associated  with  aircrew  activities  such  as  base  operations,  fleet  service,  cargo  or  passenger terminals, flightline cafeterias, snack bars, etc.  (T-3) 7.5.4.  Weapons Storage.  Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or onload duties.  When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may  be  stored  in  the  gun  box  inflight.    If  no  gun  box  is  available  retain  weapon  for  the duration  of  the  flight.    Crew  members  will  rearm  before  landing.    Weapons  need  not  be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.  (T-3) 7.5.5.  Crew  Rest.    During  crew  rest,  store  weapons  in  the  most  secure  facility  available, normally  the  base  armory.    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable  or  the  country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.  (T-3) 7.5.5.1.  Aircraft  without  a  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories,  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  and  US  civil  law enforcement  armories.    If  none  of  these  are available,  or  the  PIC/MC  believes  weapons security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters; however, one crew member will remain with the weapons at all times.  In this case, turn the ammunition over to the PIC. 7.6.  Antihijacking Guidance.  Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an aircraft hijacking  attempt.    Resistance  may  vary  from  dissuasion  to  direct  physical  confrontation, including the use of deadly force.  Due to the sensitive nature of antihijacking procedures, crew members  should  reference  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft  Piracy  (Hijacking) (FOUO)  and  the  FIH  for  specific  guidance.    Aircrews  will  not  release  any  information concerning  those  procedures  or  hijacking  attempts.    Antihijacking  is  a  crew  duty  performed exclusively  by  aircrew  personnel.    The  hijacking  of  an  AFSOC  aircraft  could  create  a  serious international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property.  An aircraft is most vulnerable  when  the  crew  is  on  board  and  the  aircraft  is  ready  for  flight.    Hijackers  cannot  be dealt with as ordinary criminals.  Some are mentally disturbed, emotionally unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.  (T-3)   76  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 7.6.1.  Acceptance  of  Passengers.    The  host  station  passenger  processing  and  manifesting facility should conduct antihijacking inspections.   Do not board passengers unless the PIC is fully  satisfied  with  these  inspections.    Exception:    Supporting/supported  forces  may  be antihijack inspected at the aircraft by the aircrew.  (T-3) 7.6.1.1.  Aeromedical Procedures.  Military medical facility commanders are responsible for the antihijacking inspection of patients.  When patients are delivered to the aircraft by civilian sources, the aircrew will perform required inspections before departure.  (T-3) 7.6.1.2.  Contingency  and  exercise  movements.    During  contingencies  in  support  of combat operations and exercises involving the movement of large numbers of personnel, the supported unit should manifest passengers and perform antihijacking inspections. 7.6.2.  Arms  and  Ammunition.    Passengers  (including  MEP)  will  not  carry  weapons  and/or ammunition  on Exception:    special  agents/guards  of  the  Secret  Service  or  State  Department  and  other individuals  specifically  authorized  to  carry  weapons  with  coordination  of  the  PIC.    In  all cases the crew will be aware of the location of weapons and ammunition.  (T-3) in  hand-carried  baggage  on  board  an  aircraft.   their  person  or 7.6.2.1.

Move  to  a  safe,  clear  area  at  least  50  ft  from  any  aircraft,  equipment,  or personnel before unholstering/unslinging their weapons. 7.6.2.1.2.  Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. turn it in but  will 7.6.2.2.  Troops and deadhead crew members will not retain custody of ammunition on an aircraft Exception:    During  combat  operations,  troops  may  carry  unloaded  weapons  and ammunition  on  board  the  aircraft.    When  the  tactical  situation  dictates,  personnel  who will  engage  an  enemy  force  immediately  upon  deplaning  at  the  objective  may  carry loaded weapons aboard the aircraft at the discretion of the troop commander/team leader, with the PIC’s concurrence.  Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.  (T-3) commander to the troop or PIC.   AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   77  Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  This  chapter  contains  a  description  of  applicable  reports  and  forms.    For assistance in completing safety forms contact the wing/group, unit, or local flight safety officer. 8.2.  AF  Form  457,  USAF  Hazard  Report.  Refer  to  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap Prevention  Program.    The  USAF  hazard  reporting  system  provides  a  means  for  Air  Force personnel  to  alert  supervisors  and  commanders  to  hazardous  conditions  requiring  prompt corrective  action.    A  hazard  is  any  condition,  act,  or  circumstance  that  jeopardizes  or  may jeopardize  the  health  and  well  being  of  personnel,  or  which  may  result  in  loss,  damage,  or destruction of any weapons system, equipment, facility, or material resource. 8.3.  AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report.  Refer to AFI 91-202. 8.3.1.

(T-3) 9.3.  Debriefing.  Review and assess overall training performed.  Each student or crew member should thoroughly understand what training has been accomplished.  All required documentation should be completed as expeditiously as possible.  (T-3) 9.4.  Simulated Emergency Procedures (EP). 9.4.1.  Simulate EPs (engine shutdown, placing switches in other than their normal positions, or  an  abnormal  configuration  such  as  no  flap  landings  or  simulated  engine  failure)  only during training, evaluation, or currency flights when an instructor or flight examiner pilot is in one of the pilot seats.  Instructor pilot candidates who occupy a pilot seat and are under the supervision of a flight examiner pilot, not in a pilot seat, may practice simulated emergency procedures  during  initial  or  requalification  upgrade  evaluations.    Preface  all  simulated emergencies  with  the  word  "simulated"  and  terminate  simulated  emergencies  if  an  actual emergency arises.  (T-2) 9.4.2.  When conducting simulated engine(s)-out training, the flight engineer will post actual charted  minimum  control  speeds  on  the  TOLD  card  (refer  to  the  flight  and  performance manuals).  The instructor pilot will maintain positive torque, of no less than 1,000 in-lbs, on the simulated inoperative engine(s).  (T-2) 9.4.3.  Turns  into  the  simulated  inoperative  engine(s)  should  be  minimized.    Such  turns require a higher degree of pilot skill than with actual inoperative engines and must be smooth and WARNING:  Improper rudder or power application can lead to an immediate out-of-control condition where recovery may not be possible.  (T-2) coordinated.   9.4.4.  Simulated  EPs  are  prohibited  with  passengers  on  board  unless  such  personnel  are required for mission accomplishment, such as FCFs and test missions.  Limit personnel to the absolute minimum required.  (T-2) 9.4.5.  Conduct  simulated  EPs  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  Chapter  5,  and  this instruction.  Use a realistic EP scenario and do not compound EPs.  Limit simulated EPs to noncritical  phases  of  flight  when  possible.    (T-2)      Notify  the  controlling  agency  if  a nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.  (T-3) 9.5.  Maneuver Restrictions.

During  takeoff  and  landing,  cross-check available  flight  instruments  and  navigational  aids  with  the  airborne  radar  to  ensure  the aircraft  remains  clear  of  obstructions.    On  all  departures  and  arrivals,  have  the  appropriate approach plate open to monitor course, timing, and altitude.  Backup the pilots and assist as   88  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 necessary.    Report  any  deviations  immediately.    Assist  in  clearing  for  other  aircraft  when possible.  Confine activities to these critical duties during all departures and arrivals.  (T-2) 11.4.2.  Flight Records Completion.  On standard routes record entries in ETA/actual time of arrival (ATA) blocks of AF Form 4116, Navigator Flight Plan and Log, or other applicable form.    On  routes  when  portions  of  the  planned  route  transit  oceanic  airspace  and  the  total time between the last suitable airfield and the first suitable airfield is 5 hours or more, record time, aircraft position, and spot wind at least once each hour when present and future position is  assured  by  either  valid  Self-Contained  Navigation  System  (SCNS)/Mission  Computer (MC)  data  or  moving  map  system.    Begin  manual  log  procedures  using  AF  Form  4116  or other  applicable  form  from  last  recorded  fix  when  positional  accuracy  of  these  systems  are degraded or denied. Whichever form is used, it will be completed in sufficient detail to fully evaluate Note:    Immediately  report  malfunctions  or  loss  of  navigational  capability  that  will  degrade course centerline accuracy to ATC.  (T-2) reconstruct the or flight.  (T-2)   11.4.2.1.  Each hour after initial level off, plot each fix or position along with time at that position.    Fixes/positions  may  be  numbered  and  corresponding  numbers  entered  into position column of the log instead of the geo-coordinates or descriptive position.  (T-2) 11.4.3.  True Airspeed (TAS) Check.  Compute a TAS check on all flights when portions of the planned route transit regions with no or unreliable navigation aids (NAVAID) exceeding three hours.  Compute within one hour after reaching the initial cruise altitude.  (T-2) 11.4.4.  Deviation  Check.    Perform  a  compass  deviation  check  for  all  magnetic  compass systems  on  flights  when  route  portions  transit  regions  with  no  or  unreliable  NAVAIDs exceeding  three  hours.    Accomplish  as  soon  as  practical  after  initial  level  off  or  coast  out.  Refer to AFTTP 3-3.MC-130 Attachment 5 for deviation check calculations.  (T-2) 11.4.5.  Inflight  Fuel  Management.    Inflight  fuel  management  is  required  on  all  missions.  Monitor  fuel  status  once  per  hour  on  all  flights.    Compute/record  fuel  status  once  per  hour when route portions transit regions with  no or  unreliable  NAVAIDs exceeding  three hours.  Averaging current en route burn rate and planned terminal fuel flow (TFF) to calculate fuels may  be  used.  Refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.MC-130  Attachment  5  for  additional  fuel  management methods.  (T-2) 11.4.5.1.  Alternate MC-130H AF Form 4116 Inflight Fuel Management Procedures. 11.4.5.1.1.  The  MC-130H  fuel  and  power  management  computations  provide  a highly flexible and accurate alternate means of continuously monitoring aircraft fuel status.    The  advantages  of  this  system  include  the  ability  to  react  to  flight  and atmospheric  changes;  the  ability  to  include  expected  fuel  burnoff  increases  (off-course  maneuvering,  icing,  etc.)  on  the  exact  legs  on  which  they  apply,  and  the capability to continuously monitor fuel status.  System limitations include Bingo fuel calculations that may not match the requirements in this regulation, the assumption of level flight at the constant speed specified for a leg, and reliance on indicated (gauge) fuel  quantity  only.    In  the  interest  of  safety,  the  following  alternate  inflight  fuel management procedure is authorized only if the mission computer fuel remaining for the current leg does not exceed the calculated fuel value +1,500 pounds.  As long as AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   89  mission computer and totalizer gauge fuel remaining values are the same, calculated and gauge values can be used to verify this requirement.  (T-2) 11.4.5.1.2.  Ensure leg data entries for current and all future leg altitudes, OAT, TAS, and winds reflect the best estimate of actual conditions.  TAS should be flagged as the controlling  item  for  time  or  speed  calculations.    The  flight  plan  must  be  set  up  to include legs through the AREP and EAR for segments ending in air refueling.  Ensure EAR fuel is sufficient to fly to AR abort base.   Do not enter the planned fuel on-load, but off-loads to match expected icing, delays, etc., should be included.  Block entries on the AF Form 4116 are as follows:  (T-2) 11.4.5.1.2.1.  ETA DEST.  Revised ETA at destination/EAR. 11.4.5.1.2.2.  TIME.    Enter  takeoff  time  in  the  first  column.    Starting  with  the second column, record level-off time and time intervals of approximately 1 hour (± 10 minutes). 11.4.5.1.2.3.  GROSS WT.  Aircraft gross weight at the time of the fuel reading.  Can  be  interpolated  from  the  Fuel  and  Power  Management  page  of  the  mission computer. 11.4.5.1.2.4.  PAGE  NO.    Enter  “MC”  (for  fuel  reading  obtained  from  the Mission Computer). 11.4.5.1.2.5.  FUEL REM.  MC fuel remaining for the destination/EAR leg (from the Fuel and Power Management page of the mission computer). 11.4.5.1.2.6.  O/H FUEL.  Alternate and missed approach fuel plus holding fuel, plus approach and landing fuel (Block 13 on front of AF Form 4116). 11.4.5.1.2.7.  DIFF.  Subtract O/H FUEL from FUEL REM. 11.4.5.1.2.8.  Leave  remaining  entries  blank  (FUEL  ETE,  ETE  DEST,  EXT TIME, and TEMP DEV/ALT). 11.4.5.1.2.9.  Prior  to  the  ETP,  if  DIFF  becomes  negative,  plan  to  return  to departure  base  or  the  last  suitable  airfield,  or  continue  to  first  suitable  airfield.  Evaluate  carefully  in  order  to  arrive  over  the  chosen  field  with  fuel  required overhead destination. 11.4.5.1.2.10.  The  navigator  may  terminate  these  procedures  one  hour  from destination, when the Category I route segment is completed, or at the discretion of Note:  These procedures are valid only if the Mission Computer flight plan agrees with  the planned route of flight.  If the planned route of flight is  changed, these computations  will  be  in  error  until  the  flight  plan  is  corrected  and  waypoint steering selected. Aircraft the Commander.   11.4.6.  ETP.  Recompute the ETP when the actual arrival over any reporting point prior to the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind and the change was caused by erroneous wind information.  If the change was caused by factors other than a change in the wind (i.e., slow TAS or deviation for weather), simply compute a new ETA to the ETP, as the ETP itself will not have changed.

General.  In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  the  flight  manual,  other  applicable  technical orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties to the flight engineer, as necessary. 12.2.  Authority  to  Clear  a  Red  X.  Flight  engineers  are  normally  not  authorized  to  clear  a red  X.  In a situation where the aircraft is on a red X and qualified maintenance personnel  are unavailable, the flight engineer may obtain authorization to clear the red X from the home station MXG/CC or designated representative in accordance with TO 00-20-1.  (T-2) 12.2.1.  At  en  route  stations,  flight  engineers  are  authorized  to  clear  red  X  symbols  for:  intake and exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft panels removed and installed to facilitate other maintenance.  (T-2) 12.2.2.  The  Flight  Engineer  will  obtain  the  PIC’s  signature to  clear  a red  X  and/or sign  an exceptional release if qualified maintenance personnel are not available.  (T-2) 12.3.  In-Process Inspections.  Flight engineers must be aware of their responsibility to perform in-process  inspections  when  clearing  red  X  symbols.    During  the  assembly  where  further assembly  will  prevent  the  required  inspection  of  the  item,  an  in-process  inspection  will  be performed.  The inspection will be documented IAW TO 00-20-1.  (T-2) 12.4.  Aircraft Servicing.  Flight engineers are normally not required to refuel or defuel aircraft; however,  the  flight  engineer  is  qualified  and  authorized  to  accomplish  these  duties  when maintenance personnel are not available.  If ground support personnel are not available, the flight engineer will act as the refueling supervisor and the  PIC will designate other crew members to assist  the  flight  engineer.    Use  the  appropriate  checklist  during  all  refueling  and  defueling operations.  (T-2) 12.4.1.  Concurrent  Ground  Operations.    The  PIC  and  Concurrent  Servicing  Supervisor (CSS)  shall  ensure  aircrew  members  and  servicing  personnel  accomplish  concurrent servicing (CS) in accordance with TO 00-25-172 and servicing technical orders.  (T-2) 12.4.1.1.  Simultaneous fuel and oxygen servicing is not authorized.  (T-2) 12.4.1.2.  Winching  of  rolling  stock  and  non-spark  producing  (i.e.,  wooden)  pallets  is authorized.    Driving  vehicles  equipped  with  spark  arresters  is  authorized  during  fuel servicing.    When  loading  vehicles  without  spark  arresters,  the  vehicles  must  be  either completely  inside  the  cargo  compartment,  or  outside  of  the  established  fuel  servicing safety Exception:    Diesel  and  turbocharged  (without  waste  gates)  gasoline-powered  vehicles can be on/offloaded without having to stop fuel flow.  (T-2) servicing before zone, fuel lines can be pressurized.   12.4.2.  Hot Refueling.   Hot refueling (refueling with  aircraft engines  running) will only  be conducted by crews that have been authorized and certified according to AFI 11-235. 12.5.  Preparation for NVG Operations.

(T-2) 12.6.2.  Maintain outside vigilance and taxi clearances when flight deck duties allow.  (T-2) 12.6.3.  Advise and assist the pilots in maintaining required climb and cruise power.  (T-2) 12.6.4.  Monitor  TF/low-level  operations,  particularly  altitude,  bank  angle,  airspeed,  and heading.  (T-2) 12.6.5.  Ensure  both  pilots  heading  markers  are  set  correctly  during  the  turn  point  briefing (MC-130P  low-level  operations).    Ensure  both  pilots  and  navigator  radar  altimeters  are  set correctly for the specific TF/low-level altitude or instrument approach.  (T-2) 12.6.6.  State “17,000” over interphone when any engine torque approaches this value.  (T-2) Note:  In the event of an inadvertent over-torque, refer to Table 12.1.  Carefully consider the over-torque actions criteria in order to determine mission impact.  (T-2) Table 12.1.  Over-Torque Actions  (T-2).

Reduction  Gearbox  may require change if gearbox oil pressure is lower than before over-torque. WARNING:    Failure  to  comply  with  these  criteria  could  result  in  catastrophic  structural failure. Note:    The 25-flight hour limit is based on flight time to return the aircraft for maintenance.  AFSOC  aircraft  that  experience  an  over-torque  over  23,000  in-lbs  are  to  immediately  return the aircraft for inspection and required maintenance. 12.6.7.  Notify the pilots when aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver.  (T-2) 12.7.  Forms  Management.  In  addition  to  the  procedures  in  TO  00-20-1  and  AFI  11-401,  the flight engineer will assist the pilot in maintaining the AFTO Form 781.  Verify the exceptional release is signed before flight and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops.  (T-2)   96  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 12.7.1.  After  each  flight,  ensure  the  number  of  discrepancies  (if  any),  landings,  flight duration time(s), etc., are entered on the AFTO Form 781H.  Review all AFTO Form 781A discrepancies and ensure symbols, date discovered, and clear, detailed entries are entered and the discovered by blocks are signed for each discrepancy.  (T-2) 12.7.2.  IAW DESC-I-31, Purchase of Aviation Fuel and Services at Commercial Locations, all  off-station  fuel  purchases  (to  include  FARP  and  inflight  refueling)  will  be  logged  on AFTO Form 781H and AF Form 664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, if applicable.  (T-2) 12.7.3.  An  automated  inspection,  repair,  corrosion  and  aircraft  tracking  (AIRCAT) worksheet (electronic or paper copy) will be completed for all flights IAW TO 1C-130-101, Aircraft  Usage  Report  Instructions.    Automated  Inspection,  Repair,  Corrosion  and  Aircraft Tracking (AIRCAT) worksheets will be entered into the AIRCAT reporting system within 3 duty  days  of  the  flight  or  return  from  TDY.    Deployed  units  will  establish  criteria  to  input AIRCAT data within a reasonable time period depending on network support of the deployed unit.    If  unable  to  obtain  connectivity  with  the  AIRCAT  server  due  to  austere  conditions, units will attempt to inform OGV of the situation and any delays in AIRCAT reporting.  (T-2) 12.7.4.  IAW  AFMAN  23-110,  USAF  Supply  Manual,  the  flight  engineer  will  record  all inflight  transfers  from  C-130  tanker  aircraft  to  any  receiver  aircraft  on  the  AF  Form  791.  This form will also be accomplished for FARP offloads and fuel jettison in excess of 1,000 pounds.    Turn  completed  forms  into  maintenance  debrief.    Instructions  for  completing  AF Form 791 can be found on the HQ AFSOC/A3V SharePoint Website.  (T-2) 12.8.  Performance Data Computations AF Form 4064, C-130 TOLD Card. 12.8.1.  Flight engineers will complete TOLD cards using the performance manual, approved TOLD Computer, or approved tabulated data.  Flight engineers should make every effort to use  the  performance  manual  when  computing  performance  data  for  the  first  takeoff  of  the day.    TOLD  for  takeoff  will  be  completed  prior  to  the  BEFORE  STARTING  ENGINES checklist.    Complete  data  applicable  to  the  type  of  takeoff  and  landing  to  be  made  (i.e., landing distance for normal landing; ground roll for assault landings).  Base all performance calculations  on  100%  engine  efficiency  without  nosewheel  steering.    If  100%  engine efficiency  cannot  be  obtained,  calculate  performance  using  95%  efficiency.    Do  not  accept any engine with less than 95% efficiency.  (T-2) 12.8.2.  When stop-and-go operations are planned, the flight engineer will compute and post critical field length using either reduced power TIT or maximum power.  (T-2) 12.9.

(T-2)   104  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 Chapter 15 AIRBORNE MISSION SYSTEMS SPECIALIST (AMSS) PROCEDURES 15.1.  General.  The  Airborne  Mission  Systems  Specialist  is  responsible  to  the  PIC  for  the proper  programming,  management,  operation  and  inflight  troubleshooting  of  communications, navigation,  IFF/SIF,  and  specialized  mission  equipment.    In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  the flight  manual,  other  applicable  technical  orders,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may  assign  other duties to the AMSS as necessary.  This chapter provides guidance on AMSS procedures for all missions and completion of applicable forms. 15.1.1.  Specifically, the AMSS will tune, configure, operate, and troubleshoot voice and data communications systems and manage communications nets to support mission requirements; perform  frequency  management,  recommend,  and  make  required  communications  changes; compile  and  transmit  required  inflight  and  position  reports  to  appropriate  facilities;  be familiar  with  communication  threat  systems;  and  coordinate,  obtain,  use,  and  control COMSEC and transmission security (TRANSEC) material and equipment.  (T-2) 15.1.2.  Further,  the  AMSS  will  scan  for  ground  and  air  threats  using  night  vision  devices; direct aircraft defensive maneuvers and operate aircraft defensive systems as required; scan for terrain and aircraft avoidance during ground/airborne operations.  (T-2) 15.1.3.  Additionally,  the  AMSS  will  provide  assistance  to  the  pilots  and  navigators  by monitoring  aircraft  altitude,  heading,  and  position  through  SCNS,  control  and  display  unit (CDU),  Portable  Flight  Planning  System  (PFPS)  and  charts.    The  AMSS  will  establish  and maintain  communications  with  appropriate  C2  agencies;  to  include  airborne  warning  and control system (AWACS), ATC, FSS and Oceanic Control as directed.  (T-2) 15.2.  Mission  Planning.  The  AMSS  will  verify  COMSEC/TRANSEC requirements, frequencies, call signs, routing, altitudes, terrain clearance, airspace deconfliction and equipment status with the PIC and/or navigator prior to departure.  Preferably mission planning should be accomplished  the  day  prior  to  flight.    For  overseas  flights,  verify  the  flight  plan  with  the navigator  and  clarify  position  reporting  duties.    If  mission  planning  is  completed  by  another AMSS  for  any  reason,  the  flying  AMSS  will  ensure  all  required  items  are  accomplished  and briefed to the PIC and navigator.  (T-2) 15.2.1.  Non-Mission Sortie.  Most sorties not using either the COMBAT ENTRY/COMBAT EXIT  or  INFIL/EXFIL  checklist  will  be  considered  non-mission  sorties.   Allied Communications Publications (ACP) 121-series, as supplemented, prescribes procedures for HF communication between aircraft and ground stations for most circumstances.  All AMSSs must  be  proficient  in  the  use  of  these  ACP  series  (http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/)  in addition  to  ACP 122,  131,  135,  160  (US  Sup  1C),  and  Joint  Army  Navy  Air  Force Publication (JANAP) 146.  Ensure long-range communication, primarily HF and SATCOM secondary, are established prior to departing VHF/UHF range. 15.2.2.  Mission Sorties.  Any sortie using either the COMBAT ENTRY/COMBAT EXIT or INFIL/EXFIL checklist will be considered a mission sortie.  Communications requirements in support of covert or sensitive operations dictate the AMSS blend in with certain existing or mobile  ground  stations  and  avoid  attracting  attention  to  the  mission.    The  AMSS  will  use "ground" style communication procedures in accordance with ACP 125, instead of ACP 121 AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   105  US  Supp-2,  when  flying  in  a  tactical  environment  and  will  make  every  effort  to  avoid identifying their station as an aircraft.  (T-2)   Long-range communication channels will be as directed by the mission controlling authority.  (T-3) 15.2.3.  Aircraft Status.  As soon as possible, verify communication, navigation, and IFF/SIF equipment  status  with  maintenance.    Advise  the  PIC  and  navigator  of  any  limitations  to support  mission  requirements. Note:    Once  airborne,  the  PIC  must  approve  continued  operations  of  malfunctioning equipment that would affect the mission.  (T-2)   If  possible,  have  a  work-around  plan  available.   for current frequencies. 15.2.4.  Frequencies  and  Call  Signs.    The  AMSS  will  review  the  ATO  prior  to  each  flight when  deployed  or  during  exercise  participation;  additionally,  review  at  a  minimum  SPINS Chapters  2,  3,  and  7.    Use  current  FLIP,  inflight  guides  (IFG)  and  other  documents  and publications at:  (https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/Aeronautical/FlightInfoPubs/Pages/default.aspx).  Obtain emergency airfield information from the navigator and identify communications and  available  services  at  the  designated  emergency  airfields.    Obtain  aircraft  types  and  call signs for all aerial refueling operations; check IFGs and applicable DOD FLIP Area Planning publications for A/R track information as required.  Be prepared to brief the crew on mission communications. Note:    Figure  15.1  through  Figure  15.5  contain  listings  of  commonly  used  frequencies, including  search  and  rescue,  citizen  band,  and  the  AN/ARC-222  International  Maritime Channel presets. obtained FLIP   can be (T-2)   15.2.5.  Communications Threat Planning.  When deployed or during exercise participation, the  AMSS  will  obtain  information  on  enemy  systems  that  can  effect  communications, navigation  and  IFF  equipment  in  the  mission  area.    On  operational  missions,  the  AMSS should  be  prepared  to  employ  antijam  communications.

Additionally, the AMSS will report "Ops Normal" as required by appropriate operations order (OPORD).  If  SATCOM  is  inoperative,  the  AMSS  will  send  traffic  via  USAF  Global  HF  stations primary,  or  by  any  available  means,  including:    military  affiliated  radio  station  (MARS), military  aeronautical  communications  system  (MACS),  or  FSS  relays  to  the  controlling  C2 agency as specified in the OPORD, operations plan (OPLAN), theater concept of operations (CONOPS), and/or mission directive. 15.3.5.  Frequency  Monitoring.    The  AMSS  will  normally  control  the  use  of  primary  C2 frequency  and  notify  the  PIC  of  the  primary  C2  frequency  and  other  mission/tactical frequencies in use.  The AMSS will coordinate on radio configuration and use with the pilots and navigator.  (T-3)  Support agencies may advise aircrews via the controlling ATC agency to  establish  contact  when  communication  is  needed.    Periodic  "Ops  Normal"  calls  or continuous monitoring of global HF station frequencies is normally not required.  In times of increased tensions, constant monitoring of command and control channels may be required. 15.3.6.  Joint Spectrum Interface Resolution (JSIR) Reports.  EMI can be caused by enemy, neutral,  friendly,  or  natural  sources,  the  primary  difference  between  hostile  and  non-hostile EMI  is  intention.    The  AMSS  will  report  any  hostile  interference  experienced  while supporting  joint  operations  in  accordance  with  Joint  Task  Force  or  Combatant  Command procedures (see SPINS).  When EMI is suspected to be non-intentional, file reports through the  unit  frequency  manager.

General.  This  volume  establishes  procedures  for  AFSOC  Direct  Support  Operators (DSO)  for  employment  of  MC-130  aircraft.    In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  applicable technical  orders,  directives,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may  assign  other  duties  as  necessary.  The DSO is primarily responsible for providing inputs to enhance aircrew situational awareness.  Refer to the DSO AFSOCI. 16.2.  Mission Planning Factors. 16.2.1.  Mission Planning.  Detailed information on mission planning can be found in AFTTP 3-1.General  Planning  (S),  AFTTP  3-1.Threat  Guide  (S),  AFTTP  3-1.MC-130  (S),  and AFTTP 3-3.MC-130 (U). 16.2.2.  The  DSO,  after  coordinating  with  the  supporting  analyst  and  other  appropriate agencies,  will  conduct  mission  planning  with  the  aircrew  of  all  combat  mission  scenarios.  The DSO will brief expected scenario inputs based on the analytical data, as required. 16.2.3.  The  DSO  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  all  appropriate  agencies  to  obtain  all required or anticipated mission planning, professional, and SILENT Shield equipment for the duration  of  the  flight/deployment.    The  DSO  will  ensure  all  equipment  is  inventoried  and inspected prior to flight/deployment. 16.3.  Preflight/Inflight Responsibilities.  The DSO will: 16.3.1.  Brief  the  crew  on  the  SILENT  SHIELD  equipment  configuration  and  anticipated inputs. 16.3.2.  Ensure the crew is aware of SILENT SHIELD capabilities and limitations, as well as operational security considerations. 16.3.3.  Monitor  situational  awareness  information  and  relay  pertinent  information  to  the crew. 16.3.4.  Advise the crew of any change in the status of mission equipment. 16.3.5.  The  DSO  is  responsible  for  knowing  approximate  aircraft  location,  altitude,  and intentions at all times. 16.4.  Communications  Procedures.  When  missions  require  the  DSO  to  communicate,  they will obtain proper frequencies, time hack, schedules, and call signs prior to flight.  Depending on the nature of the mission and the communications, the DSO will keep the crew updated on any pertinent information and will coordinate with the PIC for authorization to transmit.  On MC-130 aircraft,  the  DSO  will  coordinate  with  the  crew  during  mission  planning  regarding  interphone connectivity. 16.5.  Post Mission.  In addition to appropriate debriefs, the DSO will also ensure: 16.5.1.  Equipment write-ups are passed on to maintenance. 16.5.2.  Post mission technical summary (TECHSUM) inputs are provided to the supporting analyst.   114  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 16.5.3.  Provide information to their units summarizing mission events, as required. 16.6.  Augmentation.  Some contingency operations may require operators from other units, or in  some  cases,  non-aircrew  personnel  to  provide  tactical  cryptologic  support.   In  these  cases,  a mission-ready instructor-qualified DSO will fly as the primary DSO and be responsible for DSO inputs. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   115  Chapter 17 COMMON EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 17.1.  General.  This  chapter  provides  regulatory  guidance  for  MC-130  common  employment procedures.    This  instruction  and  the  tactical  manuals  are  not  exclusive  sources  for  their respective subject matters.  Some duplication exists to more effectively convey the information. 17.2.  Mission  Planning.  All  pilots,  navigators,  and  EWOs  will  conduct  a  route  study  prior  to any  low-level  operations.    The  route  study  will  emphasize  aircraft  limitations  and performance factors and their impact on terrain and obstacle clearance.  (T-2) 17.2.1.  Survival  and  Protective  Equipment.    All  personnel  will  wear  the  survival  and protective gear provided during hostile environment operations.  Exception:  Pilots may doff equipment that interferes with   control  yoke movement.  Additionally, other crew positions may doff equipment at the Aircraft Commander’s discretion.  Such equipment, if available, includes,  but  is  not  limited  to  the  following:    flak  vest,  LPU,  survival  vest  and  kit, parachute/harness (chute readily available), and protective headgear.  (T-2) electronic 17.2.2.  Charts.  Planned routes will be drawn on a TPC or larger scale chart.  Crews will use a  JOG  or  larger  scale  chart  for  overland  threat  penetration  operations,  mountainous  NVG low-level  operations,  and  objective  areas,  unless  not  available  or  of  inferior  quality  to  the TPC.  If a TPC is used for planning, adjust MSA altitudes to account for the larger contour interval  unless  terrain  elevation  can  be  positively  verified  by  other  means.    If  electronic charts are used, a backup paper chart must be immediately available for each crew member using WARNING:    Aeronautical  charts  do  not  depict  man-made  obstacles  less  than  200  ft  AGL (may  be  higher  outside  the  US)  or  a  change  in  terrain  until  it  exceeds  the  chart  contour interval.  The worst situation would occur if a 199 ft tower sat on terrain with an elevation just below the next higher contour.  For a TPC with a contour interval of 500 ft, this results in an  uncharted  obstacle  existing  698  ft  above  charted  terrain.    Additionally,  the  highest  spot elevation  on  any  given  leg  may  not  be  the  highest  terrain  as  in  the  case of  gradually  rising elevations.    Crews  must  ensure  accurate  terrain  analysis  by  evaluating  spot  elevations,  the highest  contour Note:  If an NVG route (any terrain condition) has been planned using a JOG and elevations and altitudes are verified, the route may be flown with reference to a TPC. terrain  elevation  data level,  and  digital (DTED) information.   charts.  (T-2)   17.2.2.1.  Color  copies  and  laminated  charts  are  acceptable  provided  the  contour  and contrast remains intact and the same chart is used for preflight route study and flight.  If laminated charts are used, the crew will ensure the laminate does not degrade quality or readability of the chart and all data remains intact.  (T-2) 17.2.2.2.  Minimize chart clutter.  NVG altitudes will be annotated on charts when NVG low-level  is  planned.    Start  climb  points  and  the  controlling  terrain  location  will  be annotated on charts if required due to mission factors such as terrain elevation changes, hidden terrain, reduced visibility or low lunar illumination.  (T-2) 17.2.2.2.1.  NVG  altitudes.    NVG  altitudes  are  an  altitude  designed  to  provide  a degree  of  terrain  masking  and  clearance  along  the  planned  flight  path.    Base  NVG   116  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 altitudes on terrain elevation 0.5 nm either side of flight planned route, added to the planned en route AGL altitude.  (T-2) 17.2.2.2.2.  Start  climb  points  are  determined  to  identify  where  along  the  planned route of flight a climb must be initiated to maintain a specific NVG altitude profile in mountainous  terrain.    These  points  are  determined  by  working  backwards  from  the NVG  altitude  along  the  planned  route  of  flight  using  a  preplanned  VVI  or  climb gradient. 17.2.2.3.  A  daylight  route  survey  will  be  conducted  for  all  unpublished  training  routes prior  to  night/IMC  operations  below  500  ft  AGL.    Any  route  or  route  segment  not surveyed  within Exceptions:  Any published IMC area and the United Kingdom Low Fly System.  (T-2) 12  months  will considered unsurveyed.   last the be 17.2.3.  En  Route  Planning.    Crews  should  fly  tactical  missions  at  the  highest  altitude commensurate  with  the  threat  environment.    During  training,  greater  weather,  or  altitude minimums may be dictated by FLIP, ICAO procedures, or training considerations. 17.2.3.1.  Mountainous terrain is defined as a 500 ft or greater terrain differential in 1/2 nm or less. 17.2.3.2.  Emergency Safe Altitude (ESA).  ESA is an altitude that will provide positive terrain  clearance  in  any  weather  condition  during  situations  requiring  exiting  the  low-level  environment.    To  compute  ESA,  add  1,000  ft  (2,000  ft  in  mountainous  terrain)  to the  highest obstacle,  contour  line,  or  terrain  feature  within  10  nm  of  route  centerline  or planned  flight  path,  rounded  up  to  the  next  100  ft  increment.    Use  of  area  ESAs  is recommended whenever possible; however, a single ESA is sufficient when there are no significant changes in topography.  ESA will be annotated on all flight charts.  (T-2) 17.2.3.3.  Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA).  An MSA will be computed and annotated for each leg, route segment, or  entire low-level route.  MSA provides terrain  clearance and limited threat avoidance during situations interrupting low-level operations.  To compute MSA,  for  each  leg  or  leg  segment,  add  500  ft  (or  the  planned  set  clearance  for  TF operations) to the highest obstacle, contour line, or terrain feature, within 3 nm of route centerline or the planned flight path, rounded up to the next 100 ft increment.

Threat  Penetration  (TP).    Must  be  preplanned  and  is  restricted  to  flat/rolling terrain and coastal penetrations.  Limit the time at TP altitude to the duration needed to avoid/negate the threat.  Minimum TP altitude is 100 ft AGL.  (T-2) 17.2.3.8.  Altimeter  settings.    Use  the  best  available  altimeter  setting.    Aircrews  will accurately update all altimeters prior to low-level/objective areas.  When a current local altimeter setting is not available, or a reliable altitude calibration (ALT CAL) or altitude update (ALT UPDATE) cannot be accomplished, use the lowest forecast altimeter setting (or TRUE ALT generated if lower than forecast for MC-130H).  (T-2) 17.2.3.8.1.  An altimeter setting other than ATC provided should only be used outside ATC  controlled  environments.    Use  sound  judgment  when  updating  aircraft altitude/altimeters  and  cross-check  elevations  and  new  settings  with  all  available information. WARNING:    Obtaining  an  ALT  CAL/ALT  UPDATE  at  a  significantly  higher  or lower  altitude  than  the  target  can  induce  substantial  altimeter  error.    Use  extreme caution  when  updating  the  pressure  altimeter  to  a  higher  setting,  as  lower  absolute altitudes will result.  (T-2)    17.2.3.8.2.  Apply  cold  weather  altimeter  corrections  to  any  barometric  altitude (MSA, ESA, NVG altitudes,  drop  altitudes, SCA backup  altitudes,  SCA  minimums, etc.)  during  low-level  operations  when  the  outside  air  temperature  is  below  32F/0C observed  or  forecast.    (If  the  aircraft  has  an  operable  TRUE  ALT  function  cold weather barometric altimeter corrections are not required.)  (T-2) 17.3.  Self-Contained Approach (SCA) Planning. 17.3.1.

To  compute  MDA  for  VMC  operations,  add 100 ft to the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE).  For approved IMC SCA operations, add 200 ft to the TDZE.  (T-2) 17.3.3.  Missed Approach Point (MAP).  The MAP is no later than zero distance to go on the Mission Computer/SCNS.  (T-2) 17.3.4.  SCA  Template  Construction.    Use  the  most  current  sources  for  topographic,  point obstruction, and airfield information.  (T-2) 17.3.4.1.  En Route Altitude.  The altitude profile may consist of MSL altitudes, TF radar Set Clearance Plane (as appropriate), NVG altitudes, or any combination.  In all cases, an MSL altitude profile will be planned.  (T-2) 17.3.4.2.  Obstacle  Clearance.    The  location  of  terrain  and  obstructions  will  dictate  the glide slope and altitude profile used.  Use the following procedures to analyze obstacles:  (T-2) 17.3.4.2.1.  Straight-in  SCAs.    Draw  the  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template, depicted  in  Figure  17.1,  on  a  1:250,000  or  larger  scale  chart,  if  available.    The template begins 0.3 nm either side of LZ centerline at the touchdown point, extending outward to 1 nm either side of centerline at 3 nm from the touchdown point and then extended  1  nm  beyond  the  planned  descent  point  (For  example,  a  3.2  nm  planned descent  point  requires  a  4.2  nm  long  template).    If  the  planned  descent  point is  less than 2 nm from the touchdown zone, then the standard 3 nm template will not require extension.   Note:  These are minimum distances and may be increased.  Consider such factors as the availability of radar or IDS targets, recent NAVAID performance, and time of last system position/altitude update. Figure 17.1.  SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template.  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   119     17.3.4.2.2.  Turning  and  Circling  SCAs.    The  obstacle  template  for  a  turning  or circling  SCA  consists  of  a  modified  version  of  the  straight-in  template.    Draw  the turning  SCA  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template,  depicted  in  Figure  17.2,  on  a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart if available.  Draw the straight-in portion of the SCA template  as  if  planning  a  straight-in  SCA.    Select  the  feeder  distance  where  the aircraft will intercept runway centerline.  From the pre-planned radius intercepting the feeder  distance  draw  an  inner  and  outer  corridor.    For  the  outer  corridor,  draw  a concentric  circle  with  radius  1  nm  greater  than  the  planned  radius  of  turn.    For  the inner  corridor,  draw  a  concentric  circle  with  a  radius  1  nm  less  than  the  planned radius of turn.  Connect the inner and outer corridors with a line that is perpendicular to the approach path at the point where TERM CNST will be selected or 1 nm prior to glide  slope  intercept,  whichever  occurs  first.    When  the  TERM  CNST  distance  or glide slope intercept occurs prior to intercepting the turning path, draw lines parallel to  the  offset  course  tangent  to  the  outer  and  inner  corridors.    When  using  a  large   120  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 radius with a short feeder distance, draw a tangent line from the inner corridor to the template 0.3 nm abeam the runway.  See Figure 17.2 example B. Figure 17.2.  Turning SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template (Note  Not to scale) (1 of 2).  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   121  Figure 17.3.  Turning SCA Horizontal Obstruction Clearance Template (Note  Not to scale) (2 of 2).  17.3.4.3.  Significant  and  critical  obstacles.    Using  current  large-scale  charts,  airfield diagrams,  airfield  sketches,  approach  plates,  and  imagery,  locate  significant  obstacles within  the  boundary  of  the  horizontal  template.    Significant  obstacles  are  those  within 300  ft  of  the  desired  glide  slope.    Determine  the  HAT  for  each  obstacle  by  subtracting TDZE from the MSL elevation of the obstacle.  For each obstacle, plot the along-course distance  from  touchdown  and  HAT  on  the  critical  obstacle  graph  as  shown  in  Figure 17.4,  Critical  Obstacle  Chart.    An  obstacle  is  considered  critical  if  it  falls  above  the reference line for the planned glide slope or its extension along the depicted baseline.   122  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 Figure 17.4.  Critical Obstacle Chart.  17.3.4.3.1.  For each critical obstacle identified, preplan and brief a specific means of avoidance  to  be  used  during  the  approach.    The  following  options  may  be  used separately or in combination:  (T-2) 17.3.4.3.1.1.  Use  a  steeper  glide  slope.    Glide  slopes  exceeding  4.0°  should  be carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required. 17.3.4.3.1.2.  Move the touchdown point further down the runway. 17.3.4.3.1.3.  Increase MDA. 17.3.4.3.1.4.  Establish  an  intermediate  step-down  altitude  above  the  MDA  at which  the  aircraft  will  level  off  until  positive  separation  from  the  obstacle  is assured. 17.3.4.3.1.5.  Change  the  approach  to  the  opposite  end  of  the  runway,  to  a crossing runway, parallel runway, etc. 17.3.4.4.  SCA  Vertical  Template  Construction.    Starting  at  the  touchdown  zone, construct  a  glide  slope  using  the  desired  gradient  (ft/nm)  to  a  point  along  the  final approach  course  (or  transition  path,  if  applicable)  where  it  intercepts  the  planned approach  altitude  (refer  to  Figure  17.5).    Annotate  the  glide  slope  MSL  and  AGL altitudes for each 0.5 nm distance-to-go increment out to the planned descent point.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   123  Figure 17.5.  SCA Vertical Template.  17.3.4.4.1.  Draw  the  relative  position  of  each  critical  obstacle  on  the  template  and annotate its distance-to-go, distance abeam final course centerline, and height (AGL and MSL).  (T-2) 17.3.4.5.  Missed  Approach  and  Departure.    For  planning,  allow  a  minimum  of  0.3  nm along track error and 0.3 nm cross track error at the MAP.  Assume IMC when choosing the  missed  approach/departure  flight  path.    Construct  a  horizontal  obstacle  clearance template beginning at the MAP and incorporating the planned missed approach/departure flight  path.    Use  TDZE  as  the  MSL  start  point  for  the  missed  approach.    If  the  terrain along  this  flight  path  (including  the above  errors)  rises  at a  rate  greater  than  200  ft/nm, refer  to  the  performance  manual  to  verify  that  three-engine  climb-out  will  clear  terrain.  Use the three-engine climb angle in place of glide slope (refer to the formula below).  (T-2)  Angle of Climb = Rate of Climb (ft/min) x 0.5652/GS (knots) 17.3.4.6.  The  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template  for  climb-out  extends  from  the approach  end  of  the  runway  out  to  1.0  nm  past  level  off  at  the  initial  escape  en  route altitude.    The  lateral  limits  of  the  climb-out  template  are  the  same  as  for  the  straight-in approach.  (T-2)   124  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 17.3.4.6.1.  If  any  critical  obstacles  are  identified,  consider  using  turns  during  climb out  to  avoid  them.    Ensure  that  the  three-engine  climb  path  provides  sufficient clearance from obstacles and terrain along the flight path.  (T-2) 17.4.  Airdrop  Planning.  Airdrops  may  be  conducted  in  IMC  and  VMC.    For  detailed information on drop zone (DZ) sizes, markings, types, and weather and wind limits, refer to AFI 13-217.    For  information  on  aerial  delivery  airspeeds  and  altitudes,  refer  to  AFI  11-231, Computed  Air  Release  Point  Procedures.  AFI 13-217  wind  limits  take  precedence  if  there  are discrepancies between AFI 13-217 and AFI 11-231. 17.4.1.  The  PIC  and  the  navigator(s)  will  review  the  DZ  survey  during  mission planning/route study.  (T-2) 17.4.2.  Only equipment rigged in accordance with TO 13C7-series and FM 10-500-series or USSOCOM  350-series  rigging  manuals,  properly  marked  with  accurate  weights  and shipper’s declarations will be airdropped.  Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific instructions and waivers from HQ AFSOC/A3V or Air Force Special Operations Air Warfare Center (AFSOAWC) prior to airdrop.  (T-2) the  AFJI  13-210,  Joint  Airdrop 17.4.3.  A DD Form 1748, Joint Airdrop Inspection Record, will be accomplished prior to all equipment airdrops.  Completion, retention, and disposition of the form will be in accordance Inspection  Records,  Malfunction/Incidents, with Investigations Exception:    A-7A  and  A-21  containers  rigged  for  door  bundles.    The  aerial  delivery  unit supporting  movement  of  equipment  and  supplies  will  ensure  current  publications  are available  to  the  loadmaster  to  ensure  standardization  of  joint  inspections.    Aerial  delivery units  supporting  AFSOC  unilateral  airdrop  training  will  provide  copies  of  required publications.  (T-2) Reporting, as supplemented.   and Activity 17.4.4.  Minimum en route time from takeoff to time over release point will be sufficient to safely  accomplish  all  required  checklists.    For  airdrop  involving  personnel,  the  jumpmaster must approve en route time of less than 25 minutes.  (T-2) 17.4.5.  Jumpmaster  directed  (JMD)  personnel  airdrops  require  Special  Operations  Group (SOG)/CC  approval.    The  SOG/CC  may  delegate  to  the  unit  or  mission  commander.    The user  accepts  all  responsibility  for  airdrop  accuracy  and  damage  to  equipment  or  injury  to personnel.  (T-3) 17.4.5.1.  Specific  inflight  visual  signals,  verbal  signals,  and  interphone  procedures  will be coordinated between the jumpmaster and crew.  (T-2) 17.4.5.2.  Navigators  will  accomplish  a  computed  air  release  point  (CARP)  or  high-altitude  release  point  (HARP)  calculation  to  verify  the  jumpmaster’s  computations  and inflight directions.  (T-2) 17.4.5.3.  Navigators will update the jumpmaster inflight on actual wind information and any changes to the briefed computed CARP/HARP location.  (T-2) 17.4.5.4.  After  the  slowdown  checks  are  completed,  the  loadmaster  permits  the jumpmaster  access  to  the  door  to  begin  spotting  procedures.    The  slowdown  should  be adjusted to allow the jumpmaster to begin spotting procedures not less than two minutes AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   125  out.  The jumpmaster will visually relay steering signals to the loadmaster to relay to the pilot.  The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door.  (T-2) 17.4.5.5.  One minute prior to the navigator’s release point (or as briefed), the nonflying pilot  turns  on  the  green  light  to  indicate  clearance  for  the  jumpmaster  to  make  a  final decision as to the exact exit point.  Jumpers may exit on the jumpmaster’s direction while the  green  light  is  illuminated.    The  red  light  is  turned  on  at  the  end  of  the  navigator’s computed usable DZ distance and time or when the last jumper or load exits, whichever comes Note:  The LM will not attempt to stop any remaining parachutists after the red light has been illuminated.  The LM will count any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated.  (T-2) jumpers  should  exit  after   No the red first. light is turned  on.   17.4.5.6.  JMD releases will not be mixed with any other type of airdrop method.  If JMD drop procedures are called for, the crew will follow the jumpmaster’s instructions, while adhering  to  normal  safety  concerns.    Should  the  crew  believe  the  drop  would  occur outside  of  safe  parameters,  they  will  call  "No  Drop"  and  ensure  the  red  light  is illuminated.  (T-2) 17.4.6.  Crews will not perform airdrops using parachutes for which AFI 11-231 does not list ballistics  unless  the  user  provides  ballistic  data  or  K-factor  that  has  been  verified  by  HQ AFSOC/A3V  or  AFSOAWC.    Aeronautical  Systems  Division  (ASD/ENFC),  or  US  Army Soldier’s  System  Center  Natick can  also  approve  ballistic  data  or  K-factors.    This  does  not apply  to  formal  test  missions  where  the  purpose  of  the  test  is  to  derive  ballistic  data  for  a specific load.  (T-2) 17.5.  Preparation  for  NVG  Operations.  Additional  equipment  and  actions  are  necessary  to prepare  the  aircraft  and  crew  members  for  NVG  operations.    The  minimum  aircraft  equipment requirements and aircrew responsibilities are as follows:  (T-2) 17.5.1.  Aircrew Equipment.  The PIC will ensure there is one spare set of preflighted NVGs for  the  flight  deck  crew  members.    Crew  members  will  carry  IR-filtered  flashlights,  finger lights, lip lights, or chem lights, as required. 17.5.2.  Aircraft NVG Kit.  At a minimum, this kit will include aircraft blackout and eyebrow curtains,  porthole  covers  for  the  cargo  compartment,  and  chem  lights  for  use  in  marking emergency  exit  handles.    Aircraft  are  normally  configured  for  NVG  operations  prior  to departure. 17.6.  Low-Level Procedures. 17.6.1.  Inflight  Use  of  Laptop  Computers.    EMI  Certified  laptop  computers  and  software, such  as  PFPS  or  FalconView  are  allowed  inflight  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.    Depending  on aircraft  modification,  these  laptops  can  receive positional  data  from  a  portable  GPS  system with  external/window  mounted  antenna  or  from  the  navigational  system  data  bus.    If  used properly,  these  systems  enhance  situational  awareness  (e.g.,  "Moving  Map",  FalconView, Task  View,  Threat  Overlays,  Intel  Feeds,  etc.)  and  provide  an  ability  to  replan  missions inflight.  These systems do not replace existing navigation equipment, will not be used as the sole means of navigation, and must not interfere with the accomplishment of normal duties.  (T-2)   126  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 17.6.2.  Climb to MSA (segmented authorized) or 500 set clearance plane (SCP), when either pilot  leaves  the  seat  during  low-level  flight.    During  planned  seat  swaps  when  a  qualified instructor remains in the seat, the crew may continue the low-level flight or climb to a safe altitude.  (T-2) 17.6.3.  Obstacle  clearance  speeds  (0  and  50%)  will  be  posted  for  all  low-level  flights  and updated hourly or after significant changes in aircraft gross weight.  (T-2) 17.7.  Low-Level Emergency Procedures. 17.7.1.  Crew Disorientation.  Threat permitting, when a crew becomes disoriented on a low-level mission, start a climb to ESA.  Continue the climb until the ESA is reached or a positive fix is obtained.  After obtaining a positive fix, descend and resume low-level operations.  The navigator(s)/EWOs will cross-check timing and adjust as necessary.  (T-2) 17.7.2.  Spatial Disorientation.  The nonflying pilot will be ready to immediately take control of the aircraft if the flying pilot experiences spatial disorientation or a NVG malfunction.  In either event, start a climb to at least MSA until the pilot experiencing the problem is ready to assume flying duties.  (T-2) 17.7.3.  Inoperative NVGs.  During a NVG takeoff or landing, the nonflying pilot must react quickly  to  assume  control  and  execute  the  appropriate  action,  regardless  of  qualification  or pilot position.  The crew must be ready to turn on overt landing and taxi lights to assist in the maneuver.  During NVG low-level flight, begin a climb to MSA in the event of pilot NVG failure or transition to an alternate form of low-level (i.e., radar terrain following).  (T-2) 17.7.4.  Aircraft  System  Failure.    Begin  a  climb  to  MSA  when  a  known  or  suspected malfunction prevents continued safe low-level operations.  (T-2) 17.7.5.  Emergency Climb.  The procedure should be considered in cases of, but not limited to:    certain  equipment  malfunctions,  spatial  disorientation,  inadvertent  weather  penetration, aircraft altitude and/or airspeed is critically low, and/or loss of situational awareness during low-level  operations.    Any  crew  member  may  initiate  this  procedure  and  emergency  climb execution should be as soon as possible.  (T-2) Table 17.1.  Emergency Climb Procedure. 1.  Announce “Emergency Climb” to the crew over interphone. 2.  Set maximum power on all operating engines and close all bleed air valve switches. WARNING: Power settings greater than 19,600 in-lbs of torque may be required to clear an obstacle. CAUTION: Closing the bleed valves will result in depressurizing the aircraft.  Use caution in areas of high terrain as cabin altitude may exceed AFI 11-202, Vol 3 oxygen requirements and the onset of hypoxia symptoms may complicate judgment. CAUTION: Closing  the  bleed  air  valves  may  result  in  decreased  equipment  cooling  and  may  degrade critical component operation. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   127  3.    If  initiating  a  climb  at  speeds  greater  than  flaps  up  obstacle  clearance  speed  (~140kts) climb  at  flaps  up  obstacle  clearance  speed.    If  initiating  a  climb  at  speeds  below  flaps  up obstacle clearance speed, set flaps to 50% and climb at 50% flap obstacle clearance speed. WARNING: 0% flap obstacle clearance speed provides the best angle of continuous climb.  However, when obstacles  are  a  factor  and  the  aircraft  begins  the  maneuver  at  speeds  less  than  0%  flaps obstacle clearance speed, crews should not delay initiating a climb attempting to accelerate to 0%  flaps  obstacle  clearance  speed,  in  these  cases  it  is  appropriate  to  use  50%  flap  obstacle clearance speed. 4.    Ensure  temperature  datum  valve  switches  are  in  auto  (unless  malfunction  prevents compliance). 5.  Close ramp and door (if open). 6.    Turn  away  (with  consideration  for  stall  margin)  from  terrain  if  feasible.    If  not  possible, climb straight ahead for the maximum climb angle. WARNING: If  at  flaps  up  obstacle  clearance  speed  and  turning  is  required,  additional  flaps  may  be necessary  to  avoid  an  accelerated  stall.    To  prevent  a  stall,  do  not  slow  below  obstacle clearance speed.  A low altitude stall has a high probability of resulting in a crash and loss of life. Note: A wings level climb will result in the maximum angle/rate of climb.  Any bank angle during this procedure will result in a lower than possible climb gradient and increases stall speed. 7.  The nonflying pilot will monitor and call airspeed as appropriate. 8.    The  navigator/EWO  will  state  an  MSA,  monitor  terrain  (via  radar,  chart,  etc.)  and  call “Clear of Terrain” when above all critical terrain. 17.8.  Defensive Maneuvers and Equipment. 17.8.1.  Practice  Combat  Maneuvers.    All  crew  members  will  be  prebriefed  and  advised  of the time period/portion of the flight when practice threat maneuvers will be executed.  Crew coordination  is  essential  in  avoiding  injury  to  crew  members  during  practice  threat maneuvers.  (T-2) 17.8.2.  Expendables/ECM  Training.    Conduct  all  expendables  training  IAW  CJCSM 3212.02C,  Performing  Electronic  Attack  in  the  U.S.  &  Canada  for  Tests,  Training,  and Exercises,  AFI 11-214,  AFI  10-706,  Electronic  Warfare  (EW)  Operations,  AFI  13-212, Range Planning and Operations, and applicable host nation directives.  Dispense only when approved  by  the  controlling  agency  IAW  agency  procedures  and  restrictions.    When  over open water, do not drop expendables below 500 ft AGL or within 3 nm of any surface vessel, platform, or landmass.  Operational electronic attack (EA) software may be used for training missions in CONUS, but only after the signal collection risk has been evaluated (see CJCSM 3212.02 OPSEC considerations).

During  airdrop,  after  acknowledgement  of  the 20-minute warning, loadmasters may clear off interphone, with the PIC’s approval, to facilitate movement  around  large  platforms  or  CDS  loads.    The  flying  pilot  conducting  the  airdrop  will accomplish  the  brief  associated  with  the  20-minute  warning,  or  delegate  the  brief  to  the nonflying pilot.  After completing the required 20-minute checklist items, the primary loadmaster will remain on interphone throughout the remainder of the airdrop.  (T-2) 17.9.1.  Training Operations.  Radio transmissions with the DZ are those required for safety of flight considerations or factors effecting airborne force employment.  This includes ATC directions, range clearance, unsafe surface conditions or mission changes.  When the mission dictates  radio  silence,  transmission  of  wind  information  and  range  or  drop  clearance  is  not required.  Radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution.  (T-2) 17.9.2.  Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZs.  The aircrew observing the proper briefed authentication confirms drop clearance in VMC.  A no-drop or mission cancellation is communicated by the absence of pre-briefed markings (visual or electronic), jumbled block letter, observation of the block letter X, or red smoke, light, or flare.  (T-2) 17.9.3.  In IMC, drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition.  In IMC, a no-drop  or mission  cancellation  is  communicated  by  an  authenticated  radio  transmission  or absence of the beacon. 17.10.  Ramp Operations.   WARNING:  The ramp and door and paratroop doors will not be open at the same time during flight. Paratroop Door Door and and 17.10.1.  Do not open the ramp and door to accomplish SATB/simulated airdrops with loads rigged  with  an  extraction  parachute  in  the  bomb  rack  or  HSLLADS  sling  attached.    If  the actual  airdrop  loads  cannot  be  dropped,  the  extraction  parachute  will  be  removed  from  the bomb rack and secured forward of the load and HSLLADS slings will be disconnected.  (T-2) 17.10.2.  The pilot may direct ramp and door/paratroop door opening any time after the six-minute advisory has been completed for personnel drops or six minutes prior to the time over target  (TOT)  for  non-personnel  drops  and  clearance  from  the  loadmaster  is  received.    This option  must  be  planned  and  briefed  prior  to  execution.    After  opening,  the  loadmasters  are cleared to complete their slowdown and three-minute checklist.  Consider added drag, power available, climb requirements, built up areas, and the possibility of dropped objects when the door is opened.  (T-2) 17.10.3.  Tailgate drops are when parachutists are dropped utilizing the cargo ramp and door.  Use  only  one  anchor  cable  for  personnel  static  lines  per  pass  to  a  maximum  of  20.    Static lines  for  equipment  will  be  attached  to  opposite  anchor  cables  and  must  be  rigged  for breakaway. Exception:  When airdrop loads are rigged with pilot chutes packed in T10 bags, they will be attached  to  the  same  anchor  cable  as  personnel  and  are  included  in  the  20  maximum  limit.  Static lines will be retrieved after each pass. (T-2)    17.10.4.  Multiple  Passes  (i.e.,  Racetracks).    When  performing  multiple  equipment  airdrops across the same DZ, all airdrop checklists will be accomplished.  When performing multiple AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   129  personnel  drops  across  the  same  DZ,  checklists  may  resume  at  the  6-minute  warning assuming no airdrop parameters or aircraft configuration changes are made from the previous drop.    Ensure  the  loadmaster  has  adequate  time  to  complete  all  checklist  items  before  the drop.   Exception:    During  pilot  directed  airdrops,  the  checklist  may  be  initiated  at  a  point commensurate  with  the  available  time  and  type  of  drop.    This  will  be  coordinated  at  the briefing  between  the  crew  and  jumpmaster.    When  airdrop  parameters  or  aircraft configuration changes are made between drops, all checklists will be accomplished.  Airdrop time  advisories  and  checklists  may  be  compressed,  except  for  the  one  minute  warning.  Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PIC.  (T-2) 17.10.5.  If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will not be used.  (T-2) 17.10.6.  Combination  drops  are  when  parachutists  exit  from  the  ramp  and  door  in conjunction with an airdrop load.  The item requiring the highest altitude will determine the drop  altitude.    In  addition  to  the  equipment  CARP,  the  navigator  will  compute  a  personnel CARP  down  track  from  the  equipment  release  point  using  the  computed  exit  time  for  the equipment  drop  as  the  interval  between  the  equipment  and  personnel  CARP.    Both  the equipment and personnel CARP will be based on the same airspeed and altitude.  Aircrews will maintain 130 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS)/KCAS plus or minus 5 KIAS/KCAS for all  combination  drops  involving  static  line  personnel.    If  the  computed  release  point  will result  in  any  jumper  landing  within  150  yards  of  any  boundary  of  the  DZ,  inform  the jumpmaster.    Release  the  equipment  at  the  equipment  CARP,  followed  by  the  parachutists when the door is clear.  (T-2) 17.10.7.  Airspeed  will  not  be  increased  above  140  KIAS/KCAS  until  static  lines  are retrieved.    Under  normal  conditions,  static  lines  that  cannot  be  retrieved  manually  will  be retrieved utilizing the static line retriever.  If the static line retriever fails, static lines will be manually retrieved using procedures outlined in AFTTP 3-3.MC-130.  During combat, static lines that cannot be retrieved will be cut so doors can be closed.  (T-2) 17.11.  Low  Altitude  Airdrop  Procedures.  All  equipment  planned  to  be  airdropped  will  be rigged in accordance with TO 13C7-series, TO 1C-130A-9, FM 4-20.102, and USSOCOM 350-series  directives  and  aircraft  configurations  will  be  IAW  TO  1C-130A-9.    Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific instructions and waivers from HQ AFSOC/A3V.  (T-2) 17.11.1.  Personnel.     WARNING:  A potential problem has been identified with T-10R reserve parachutes and/or the D-rings that are attached to the personnel parachute harness.  (During a parachute test at 140 KIAS both D-rings on the parachute harness fractured and completely separated from the harness when the reserve canopy became fully inflated.)  Aircrews will maintain 130 KIAS plus  or  minus  5 KIAS  for  all  static  line  personnel  airdrops,  including  combination  drops.  Crews must be aware that the lower airspeed decreases the margin of safety above stall speed and must be vigilant to ensure they maintain airspeed. 17.11.1.1.  The  loadmaster  will  ensure  the  configuration  of  the  anchor  cables  and  seats are consistent with the number of personnel to be airdropped.  Floor loading is authorized in accordance AFTTP 3-3.MC-130.  During aircraft preflight, the loadmaster will ensure that all seats have a serviceable retaining strap attached.  Fit seats without a serviceable   130  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 retaining strap with a suitable length of type III nylon, premeasured for sufficient length to  secure  the  seat  in  a  raised  position  to  the  seat  back  support  frame.    For  single  pass drops, ensure that parachutists have secured all seats (as required) and no part of the seat protrudes into the aisle.  On multiple passes, the number of parachutists to be dropped on that pass determines the number of seats raised.  Troop seats will be raised and secured, or  lowered,  as  required,  by  personnel  under  the  supervision  and  instruction  of  the loadmaster.  (T-2) 17.11.1.2.  When  an  aircraft  emergency  occurs  during  or  after  the  time  the  parachutists stand and hookup, the following procedures will apply: 17.11.1.2.1.  Under  acceptable  conditions  when  parachutists  bailout  is  required, maintain  an  acceptable  altitude  and  airspeed  for  the  parachutists  to  evacuate  the aircraft.    The  minimum  acceptable  altitude  is  as  briefed  due  to  the  differences  in parachute  employment  limitations.    If  the  jump  airspeed  will  be  in  excess  of  150 KIAS/KCAS, advise the parachutists of the airspeed and altitude.  Order evacuation of the aircraft by giving the pre-briefed bailout emergency signals. 17.11.1.2.2.  When  conditions  are  not  acceptable  for  parachutist  bailout  or  a  drop  is aborted for other reasons, the following procedures apply: 17.11.1.2.2.1.  The red light will be turned on and will remain on until exit doors are closed. 17.11.1.2.2.2.  The  pilot  will  advise  the  loadmaster,  who  in  turn  will  advise  the jumpmaster  to  have  the  parachutists  unhook,  take  their  seats,  and  fasten  safety belts. 17.11.2.  Container Delivery System (CDS). 17.11.2.1.  CDS  is  designed  to  airdrop  A-22/A-23,  A-7,  A-21,  double  A-22/A-23 containers  and  loads  rigged  on  combat  expendable  platforms.    The  weight  of  each container  and  type  parachute  used  should  be  IAW  TO  13C7-1-11,  Airdrop  of  Supplies and  Equipment:    Rigging  Containers,  FM  10-501  and  SOCOM  350-series  rigging manuals. 17.11.2.2.  CDS rigging procedures.  Utilize rigging procedures outlined in TO 1C-130A-9.  The following describes the types of CDS releases that may be used on AFSOC MC-130 aircraft. 17.11.2.2.1.  Normal System Release.  A normal system release utilizes the static line retriever and guillotine knife to  cut/release the CDS gate.  When using this method, the  loadmaster  may  assist  the  release  by  pulling  down  sharply  on  the  static  line retriever WARNING:    MC-130H  Loadmasters  will  not  utilize  the  Low  Altitude  Parachute Extraction  System  (LAPES)/CDS  switch  for  CDS  airdrops  due  to  compromised wiring integrity. winch cable.    17.11.2.2.2.  Manual  Gate  Cut.    A  manual  gate  cut  is  defined  as  using  a  knife  or  V blade  type  knife  to  cut/release  the  CDS  gate  for  all  single  stick  container  loads.  Loads  rigged  with  type  VIII/XXVI  nylon  not  exceeding  5,000  pounds  may  be manually cut using these procedures. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   131  17.11.2.2.3.  Manual Combat Cut.  A manual combat cut is defined as using a knife or V  blade  type  knife  to  cut  the  CDS  gate  regardless  of  amount,  weight,  and configuration  of  CDS  on  board.    It  is  used  only  when  authorized  as  part  of  specific exercise operations order or plan, contingencies, or by COMAFSOF. 17.11.2.3.  When  a  manual  gate  cut  or  manual  combat  cut  is  used,  navigators  should subtract 1.5 seconds from the parachute and load location exit time listed in AFI 11-231.  The  exit  times  in  AFI  11-231  have  been  calculated  using  the  static  line  retriever;  the manual gate cut and manual combat cut release the load faster.  Failing to adjust the exit time score.  WARNING:  The aircraft tends to pitch up as the load exits the aircraft.  This pitch must be anticipated and controlled to allow no more than 2 or 3 degrees additional pitch.  Do not over control to the point that negative g-forces are encountered. result short drop will in a 17.11.2.4.  The flaps should be set to 50% as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear".  If  there  is  a  malfunction  or  no  drop,  the  flaps  will  immediately  be  reset  to  the prebriefed/most appropriate position. 17.11.3.  Combat Rubber Raiding Craft (CRRC) Drop. 17.11.3.1.  CRRCs  may  be  dropped  in  a  stacked  configuration  allowing  up  to  four CRRCs to be dropped on a single pass.  One CRRC platform can be dropped using the standard  CDS  or  CRS  checklist.    When  two  CRRC  platforms  are  dropped  on  a  single pass,  use  the  CDS  checklist.    Rigged  IAW  TO  13C7-51-21.    If  aircraft  gross  weight exceeds  120,000  pounds,  perform  the  airdrop  at  140  KIAS/KCAS  using  the  140 KIAS/KCAS Exception:    For  combination  drops  above  120,000  pounds,  perform  the  airdrop  at 130 KIAS/KCAS using the 130 KIAS/KCAS flap setting chart. setting flap chart.   17.11.4.  Rigging Alternate Method Zodiac (RAMZ). 17.11.4.1.  The  RAMZ  consists  of  a  deflated  Zodiac  F470  combat  rubber  raiding  craft.  The  RAMZ  engine  is  configured  in  a  plywood  box  and  secured  in  a  standard  A-22 container using two T-10 parachutes. 17.11.4.2.  The  package  is  dropped  using  normal  CDS  combination  procedures  or  CRL procedures. 17.11.4.3.  The  anchor  cable  stop  will  be  rigged  at  FS  749  for  RAMZ  followed  by military  free-fall  (MFF)  jumpers.    Static  lines  will  be  immediately  retrieved  prior  to jumpers  exiting  the  aircraft.    Static  line  jumpers  will  exit  immediately  after  the  load release.  (T-2) 17.11.4.4.  The flaps should be set to 50% as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear".  If  there  is  a  malfunction  or  no  drop,  the  flaps  will  immediately  be  reset  to  the prebriefed/most appropriate position.  (T-2) 17.11.5.  Door Bundle. 17.11.5.1.  A7A or A-21 containers weighing up to 500 pounds (excluding the weight of the  parachute)  that  are  dropped  through  the  paratroop  door  or  ramp  and  door  using  the personnel  airdrop  checklist.    Door  bundles  may  be  dropped  independently  or  in   132  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 conjunction  with  personnel.    A  joint  airdrop  inspection  (JAI)  is  not  required  for  door bundles. 17.11.5.2.  Paratroop  Door.    Door  bundle  drops  are  limited  to  one  bundle  per  paratroop door.    When  dropped  with  personnel,  the  bundle  will  be  the  first  object  to  exit  the aircraft, and rigged non-breakaway.  The maximum bundle size for paratroop door loads is 66” (height) x 48” (width) x 30” (length) or as specified in specific rigging manual. 17.11.5.3.  Ramp and Door.  Door bundles dropped off the ramp and door,  followed by personnel, will be equipped with breakaway static lines in accordance with TO 13C7-1-11  or  with  parachutes  packed  in  T-10  bags.    Door  bundles  dropped  from  the  ramp  and door that exceed the weight or dimensions specified above will be equipped with a skid board compatible with the intermediate roller conveyors.  When dropped with personnel, the bundle will be the first object to exit the aircraft.  (T-2) 17.11.5.4.  When door bundles are dropped with personnel, compute a personnel CARP.  Compute an additional CARP for the door bundle and plot the vectors from the personnel release point to ensure that it will impact within the DZ boundaries.  Release the bundle at the personnel CARP, followed by the parachutists when the door is clear.  When a door bundle is the only object dropped, base the CARP on the bundle.  (T-2) 17.11.6.  Container Ramp Load (CRL). 17.11.6.1.  CRL  will  be  rigged  in  accordance  with  TO  13C7-1-11,  FM  10-500,  and USSOCOM 350-series  directives.    Skid  boards/combat  expendable  platforms  will  be compatible  with  intermediate  roller  conveyors.    The  loads  will  be  released  by  the loadmaster and may be followed by parachutists.  These procedures can be accomplished from either side of the cargo ramp or from centerline.  Specific aircraft preparations and rigging procedures are contained in TO 1C-130A-9.  (T-2) 17.11.6.2.  When CRL bundles are dropped with personnel, compute a personnel CARP.  Compute an additional CARP for the CRL and plot the vectors from the personnel release point to ensure it will impact within the DZ boundaries.  Release the CRL bundle at the personnel  CARP,  followed  by  the  parachutists  when  the  door  is  clear.    An  alternate procedure is to add the exit time of the CRL bundle to the personnel CARP and release the bundle at this point, followed by the jumpers.  If this method is used, the crew must coordinate  with  the  user  to  ensure  the  load  lands  at  the  desired  location.    When  a  CRL bundle  is  the  only  object  being  dropped,  base  the  release  on  the  CARP  for  the  bundle.  (T-2) 17.11.7.  Container Release System (CRS) 17.11.7.1.  The CRS is employed to airdrop "A" series containers, HSLLADS containers, CRRC,  and  the  Ahkio sled  by  MC-130H  aircraft.    Combination  airdrops  are  authorized when  dropping  CRS,  personnel  follow  the  containers  after  the  time  interval  required  to confirm the pilot or cargo parachute has deployed properly (approximately 2 to 4 seconds after  load  exit).    Aircraft  attitude  and  aircrew  procedures  are  similar  to  those  for  CDS delivery.  The flap setting will be computed using the CDS/CRS flap setting chart.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   133  17.11.7.2.  The flaps should be set to 50% as soon as the loadmaster calls "Load Clear".  If  there  is  a  malfunction  or  no  drop,  the  flaps  will  immediately  be  reset  to  the prebriefed/most appropriate position.  (T-2) 17.11.8.  Low Cost Aerial Delivery System (LCADS). 17.11.8.1.  LCADS is a one-time use, stand-alone airdrop system consisting of a modular suite of low cost airdrop items comprised of parachutes, containers, platforms, and other air items configured for low-velocity, high-velocity, and free-fall aerial delivery. 17.11.8.2.  Refer to the most current FCIF guidance for LCADS-Low Velocity (LCADS-LV),  LCAD-High  Velocity  (LCADS-HV),  and  Low  Cost  Low  Altitude  (LCLA) ballistics, procedures, and restrictions.  (T-2) 17.11.9.  Free-Fall  Delivery  System.    Free-fall  airdrop  is  the  delivery  of  non-fragile  items without  parachutes  at  very  low  altitudes  (as  low  as  100  ft  AGL).    Use  the  HSLLADS, personnel,  or  CDS  checklists  or  appropriate  checklist  depending  on  flap  setting  and  deck angle desired.  Additional crew members may be needed to eject the load.  (T-2) 17.11.10.  Standard Airdrop Training Bundle (SATB).  Conduct SATB drops at the altitude and  airspeed  specified  for  the  type  of  drop  being  simulated  and  use  the  applicable  tactical airdrop checklist.  (T-2) 17.12.  High-Altitude Airdrop Procedures. 17.12.1.  Airdrops  conducted  above  3,000  ft  AGL  are  considered  high-altitude  drops.    For HALO,  positive  identification  of  the  drop  zone  area  must  be  confirmed  electronically  or visually prior to calling the release.  For HALO or HAHO, all available navigational aids will be used to assist in positioning the aircraft over the HARP.  (T-2) 17.12.1.1.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible  on  training  and  exercise  missions,  unless prevented by airspace restrictions or other mission factors, update the preflight winds at each altitude used to compute the HARP.  Obtain these winds as near the DZ as possible. 17.12.1.2.  Drop scores are required after each pass in order to ascertain the presence or previously  unobserved  wind  phenomena  (i.e.,  wind  shear)  or  other  environmental considerations  in  the  vicinity  of  the  drop  zone.    Aircrews  conducting  military  free  fall training operations will coordinate with drop zone control personnel to obtain drop scores after each pass in order to make any necessary adjustments to subsequent passes.  Crews will pass this information to the jumpmasters for consideration prior to each subsequent pass.  (T-2) 17.12.2.  High-Altitude  Mission  Requirements.    In  addition  to  the  normal  mission  planning requirements, the following are unique to high-altitude operations: 17.12.2.1.  Aircrew  will  ensure  all  aspects  of  HALO/HAHO  airdrops  are  discussed  in detail  at  the  aircrew/jumpmaster  briefing.    Insist  on  positive  feedback  when  discussing HARP  location  and  wind  data  as  well  as  resolving  what  items  will  be  passed  to  the jumpmaster during flight.  Terminology should be clear and unambiguous.  (T-2) 17.12.2.2.  For all HALO/HAHO operations, navigators will provide the jumpmaster with a magnetic course ± 5° and a distance from the release point to the drop zone.  Inflight   134  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 changes  to  the  HARP  location  or  significant  wind  changes  will  be  relayed  to  the jumpmaster as soon as possible.  (T-2) 17.12.3.  Cabin  differential  pressure  will  be  managed  to  have  cabin  altitude  equal  to  the ambient  pressure  prior  to  completion  of  the  10-minute  checklist.    Depressurization  will  not exceed  3,000 FPM.    Pressurization  after  the  drop  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with mission requirements, but should return to a cabin altitude commensurate to the flight profile and duration as detailed in AFI 11-202, Vol 3, or below 10,000 ft MSL as soon as possible.  (T-2) 17.12.4.  High-Altitude  Oxygen  Requirements.   Only  essential  personnel  who  have accomplished  appropriate  physiological  training  described  in  AFI  11-403,  Aerospace Physiological Training Program, are permitted on mission aircraft for airdrops.  AFI 11-202, Vol  3,  General  Flight  Rules,  is  the  source  document  for  oxygen  requirements  for unpressurized  and  pressurized  aircraft  operations  and  the  associated  time  limitations.    AFI 11-409,  High-altitude  Airdrop  Mission  Support  Program,  is  the  source  document  for  high-altitude oxygen, prebreathing, and Physiology Technician (PT) requirements/restrictions. 17.12.4.1.  Incident Notification.  USAF/SGPA and MAJCOM/SG will be notified by the most expeditious manner of any physiological incident.  (T-2) 17.12.4.2.  General  Emergency  Procedures.    If  any  person  experiences  decompression sickness or unusual pain, the pilot will:  (T-2) 17.12.4.2.1.  Abort  the  mission  and  begin  a  descent  (pressurization  and  descent  will be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain). 17.12.4.2.2.  Proceed  to  the  nearest  base  at  which  qualified  medical  assistance  is available.    Advise  the  control  tower  of  the  emergency  and  request  a  flight  surgeon and an ambulance to meet the aircraft. 17.13.  Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS) Procedures. 17.13.1.  The  term  JPADS  refers  to  GPS-guided  equipment,  I-CDS,  and  MFF  airdrops  that utilize the JPADS Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) system. 17.13.2.  JPADS  Restrictions.    Wind  data  derived  from  the  JPADS  four  dimensional  wind model is suitable for mission use, but JPADS CAT does not calculate MFF HARP correctly.  AFSOC  crews  will  not  use  JPADS  CAT  as  the  sole  source  for  personnel  MFF  HARP calculations until authorized.  Aircrews will use sound judgment and evaluate the dropsonde derived  winds,  forecasted  winds  and  preflight  HARP  location  before  conducting  MFF operations.  (T-2) 17.13.3.  JPADS  certified  aircrews  are  authorized  to  use  the  JPADS  CAT  laptop  and software  (a stand-alone system)  to  calculate  release  points  for  JPADS  operations.   Refer  to AFTTP 3-3.MC-130 for the most current JPADS employment guidance.  (T-2) 17.13.3.1.  For  MFF  airdrops  only,  aircrews  can  input  dropsonde  collected  winds  into onboard  airdrop  systems,  utilize  the  Air  Force  Weather  Agency  forecast/model  during mission planning, and incorporate dropsonde collected winds when calculating HARP in AFSOC approved airdrop planning software for personnel. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   135  17.13.3.2.  (MC-130H)  Navigators  may  enter  dropsonde  collected  winds  into  the wind/temperature summary layer for use in HARP calculation.  Note:  JPADS winds are collected  in  magnetic  or  true  so  winds  may  require  conversion  to  true  before  entry  into mission computers. 17.13.4.  JPADS certified crews are authorized JPADS airdrop operations in VMC and IMC above  3,000  ft  AGL  without  the  use  of  a  Radar  Beacon  or  Ground  Radar  Aerial  Delivery System (GRADS). 17.13.5.  Drop  zone  size  criteria  during  contingency  operations  are  at  the  discretion  of  the user.  Ultimately, the user accepts responsibility for the accuracy and the condition of these airdrop loads. 17.13.6.  Wind Limits.  Refer to AFTTP 3-3.MC-130 for JPADS and dropsonde wind limits. 17.13.7.  Altitude  Restrictions.    Refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.MC-130  for  JPADS  and  altitude restrictions. 17.14.  No Drop Decisions. 17.14.1.  Prior  to  the  1-minute  warning  (2  for  HALO/HAHO),  notify  the  PIC  when  any condition exists that could jeopardize a safe drop.  (T-2) 17.14.2.  After  the  1-minute  warning  (2  for  HALO/HAHO),  any  crew  member  observing  a condition that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "No Drop" on the interphone.  (T-2) 17.14.3.  A “No Drop” will be called if all checklists are not completed by the “10 Second” call.  (T-2) 17.14.4.  The  nonflying  pilot,  navigator,  and  loadmaster  will  acknowledge  the  "No  Drop" call.    (For  MC-130H)  The  nonflying  pilot  or  flight  engineer,  loadmaster,  and  the  navigator will  immediately  configure  their  automatic  airdrop  switches  switch  to  prevent  automatic release of the load.  (T-2) 17.14.5.  If  a  no  drop  is  called  after  the  load  restraint  is  removed  and  a  racetrack  is  not planned, reapply the load restraint.  (T-2) 17.14.6.  Stopping  a  drop  in  progress.    Any  crew  member  recognizing  an  unsafe  condition during  an  airdrop  will  state  "Red  Light".    The  nonflying  pilot  will  turn  on  the  red  light  to signal airdrop termination.  (T-2) 17.14.7.  On  personnel  airdrops  where  surface  winds  are  unknown,  advise  the  jumpmaster and the airborne ground force commander when drop altitude winds exceed 30 knots.  In this instance, the decision to drop is at the user's discretion.  (T-2) 17.14.8.  During  training  operations,  the  drop  zone  safety  officer  (DZSO)  will  determine when surface conditions on the DZ are hazardous to airdrop operations.  (T-2) 17.15.  Airdrop Malfunction  and  Emergencies.  Specific emergency procedures for each type airdrop are located in the expanded checklist of the applicable flight manual or this instruction.  During airdrop missions, crews will identify what checklists will be run, a salvo area, and a race track  option  for  an  immediate  re-attack.    Prior  to  stations  time,  the  pilot  will  ensure  all  crew members  have  reviewed  the  emergency  procedures  for  the  proposed  airdrop.    The  loadmasters will conduct detailed emergency briefings.  Loadmasters will brief visual and verbal signals and   136  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 establish coordinated tasks for their crew position prior to the combat entry point or initiation of airdrop checklists, whichever occurs first.  (T-2) 17.15.1.  Amplified Fouled/Towed Parachutists Procedures. 17.15.1.1.  The  jumpmaster/safety  observer  is  responsible  for  watching  the  fouled-parachutist  to  determine  how  the  parachutist  is  entangled.    If  being  towed  by  anything other than the static line, the jumpmaster or safety will attempt to free the parachutist.  If being  towed  by  the  static  line,  the  jumpmaster/safety  observer  will  recommend  to  the pilot,  through  the  loadmaster,  whether  to  retrieve  or  cut  the  parachutist  free.    If  all parachutists  have  exited  the  aircraft,  and  there  is  no  safety  on  board,  this  responsibility rests  with  the  loadmaster.    The  pilot  will  make  the  final  decision  whether  to  retrieve  or cut  the  parachutist  free.    The  loadmaster  will  initiate  retrieval  or  cut  the  parachutist’s static  line  on  the  pilot’s  command.    If  the  parachutist is  fouled  during  a  paratroop  door exit, the first priority is to retrieve, whether the parachutist is conscious or unconscious.  If the parachutist cannot be retrieved and indicates consciousness, the parachutist will be cut free.  For a ramp exit, the first priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicates  consciousness.    If  the  parachutist  is  unconscious,  does  not  signal,  cannot  be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency retrieval WARNING:  There is not an effective or consistently reliable means to manually retrieve a fouled parachutist from either the paratroop door or ramp and door.  Manual retrieval techniques  should  be  exercised  with  extreme  caution.    During  training,  while  towing  a fouled parachutist, the pilot will maintain at least the minimum drop altitude (AGL) for the  type  parachute  being  used  and  the  mission  employed,  and  not  more  than  drop airspeed, WARNING:    If  possible,  avoid  turning  the  aircraft  in  the  direction  of  the  fouled parachutist.  Turning into the parachutist often starts violent swinging of the parachutist and poses an increased possibility of injury.  The parachutist will indicate consciousness and that his reserve parachute is ready by maintaining a tight body position and with both hands on his reserve parachute or as briefed. emergency greater procedures.   unless a exists.    17.15.1.2.  There are three methods of retrieval for towed parachutists from the paratroop door.    The  primary  method  of  retrieval  is  the  Towed  Paratrooper  Retrieval  System (TPRS).    The  secondary  method  of  retrieval  is  the  paratroop  retrieval  bar  for  aircraft equipped with this system.  The third and last method is to rig a 5,000 lb tie-down strap in the  paratroop  door  prior  to  retrieval.    The  maximum  allowable  weight  for  a  towed paratrooper,  without  the  TPRS,  for  troop  door  exit  is  250  pounds.    The  limit  is  400 pounds  when  utilizing  the  TPRS  (Does  not  apply  to  combat  or  actual  contingency missions).    Jumpmasters  are  responsible  for  parachutist  weight  restrictions.    Use  of  the retrieval assist strap (RAS) without the roller assembly, is authorized for retrieving static lines only.  The RAS together with Roller Assembly will be used for retrieval of a towed parachutist.     WARNING:    The  maximum  weight  of  parachutists  dropped  off  the  cargo  ramp  during training is 325 pounds.  Jumpmasters are responsible for parachutist weight restrictions. 17.15.2.  CDS/CRS/LCLV/LCHV Emergency Procedures. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   137  17.15.2.1.  When  notified  of  a  malfunction  the  flying  pilot  will  direct  the  FE  to  extend additional flaps and lower the nose to maintain a slight nose down attitude until the ramp and door are closed. 17.15.2.2.  The  flying  pilot  will  maintain  drop  airspeed  and  no  lower  than  the  drop altitude  AGL  (if  possible)  and  avoid  flying  over  or  upwind  of  water  or  built  up  areas.  Maintain a stable platform until the LM can secure the load and close the ramp and door. 17.15.3.  CRRC Emergency Procedures.  Use CRS/CDS airdrop emergency procedures. 17.15.4.  RAMZ  Emergency  Procedures.    Follow  either  the  CDS  emergency  procedures  or fouled parachutist procedures. 17.15.5.  Amplified Heavy Equipment (HE) Emergency Procedures 17.15.5.1.  When  notified  of  a  malfunction,  the  pilot  will  maintain  drop  airspeed  and altitude (if possible) and turn toward the salvo area.  Avoid overflight of built up areas to the  maximum  extent  possible.    The  loadmaster  will  take  the  appropriate  corrective actions  and  notify  the  pilot  when  complete.    After  completion  of  the  malfunction checklist, WARNING:    Do  not  proceed  aft  of  the  platforms/load  until  it  is  properly  restrained.  Preposition emergency aft restraint chains and additional tie-down equipment forward of the  airdrop  load.    Attach  emergency  restraint  to  the  item  that  has  the  extraction  force applied to it and remove all slack.  Total required restraint will be in accordance with TO 1C-130A-9. completion drop perform the of checklist.     17.15.6.  SATB Emergency Procedures.  If a training bundle is outside and fails to separate, make no attempt to retrieve it.  Cut the bundle loose over the pre-briefed salvo area or DZ.  If the bundle falls on the ramp, close the cargo ramp and door.  Do not attempt to remove the bundle from the ramp prior to closing the ramp and door.  When using the cargo ramp and door, a hung bundle could become wedged in the aircraft elevator during turns.  If possible, cut the static line prior to making a turn. 17.16.  GCAS  Operations.  During  low-level  operations  and  in  the  objective  area,  without  an active or operable TF system, GCAS will be operated in the tactical mode (audio or visual).  (T-2)     WARNING:  When the visual alert button is deselected there will NOT be a visual “LOW ALT” warning when the aircraft is below the radar altimeter’s variable altitude limit index (VALI) or low altitude bug. 17.17.  ETCAS  Operations.  ETCAS  may  be  operated  in  traffic  advisory  (TA)  only  mode during  formation,  low-level,  air  refueling  and  helicopter/tilt-rotor  air  refueling  operations  or IAW aircraft TO. 17.18.  SCA Procedures. 17.18.1.  SCAs  will  be  conducted  IAW  applicable  TO  guidance  (INFIL/EXFIL  checklist) and  the  MDS-specific  procedures  given  in  Chapters  18  and  19.    All  MDS-specific procedures will comply with the following:  (T-2) 17.18.1.1.  Radar  Altimeter.    All  radar  altimeters  will  be  set  to  MDA  prior  to  initiating the SCA descent unless specified otherwise in MDS employment chapter.   138  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 17.18.1.2.  Mandatory SCA calls: 17.18.1.2.1.  (MC-130P)  “Begin  Descent”.    Announced  to  initiate  descent  on  the SCA glidepath.  Prior to making this call, the navigator will verify that actual aircraft position is inside the planned SCA obstacle template. 17.18.1.2.2.  (MC-130H)  “Expect  descent  in  1  mile”.    Announced  to  prepare  pilots to descend on the SCA glidepath.  Prior to making this call, the navigator/EWO will verify that actual aircraft position is inside the planned SCA obstacle template.   Announced 17.18.1.2.3.  “100  Above”. Note:    MC-130P  crews  conducting  IMC  SCAs  will  not  descend  below  the  “100 Above”  altitude  until  the  LZ  environment  is  positively  identified  on  the  IDS.    This restriction  is  not  applicable  if  the  LZ  environment  has  been  visually  identified  and confirmed by both pilots. the  MDA.   above 100 ft 17.18.1.2.4.  “Minimums”.    Announced  at  the  MDA.    Do  not  descend  below  the MDA until the LZ environment is visually identified. 17.18.1.2.5.  “Go-Around”.  A go-around will be announced and initiated at the MAP if the LZ has not been visually acquired, a safe landing cannot be accomplished, or if directed. 17.18.1.2.6.  “Immediate Landing Feasible”.  If a go-around occurs and an immediate landing  is  feasible  and  desired,  the  flying  pilot  will  announce  intentions  and maneuver Note:    When  performing  IMC  SCAs,  the  copilot  normally  flies  the  IMC  portion  of the  SCA  and  the  pilot  assumes  control  for  the  VMC  portion  and  landing.    All  units will ensure IMC SCA procedures are incorporated into continuation training. VFR to a pattern.   17.19.  Tanker Air-to-Air Refueling. 17.19.1.  Minimum Altitudes.  Minimum Tanker Air Refueling altitude is 500 ft AGL.  Low altitude  Tanker  Air  Refueling  training  below  1,000  ft  AGL  will  not  be  conducted at  tanker gross weights above 130,000 pounds or without three engine climb capability of at least 500 FPM whichever occurs first.  Select a refueling altitude based on the threat environment, not lower than 500 ft AGL without a waiver.  In these cases, the receiver join-up altitude will be at least 300 ft below the refueling altitude for all receiver low procedures and at least 200 ft above  the  refueling  altitude  for  all  receiver  high  procedures.    When  refueling  tilt-rotor aircraft:    Prior  to  positive  identification,  a  minimum  vertical  separation  of  500  ft  will  be maintained  between  tanker  and  receiver  during  all  rendezvous.    Once  the  receiver  is positively  identified,  minimum  vertical  separation  may  be  reduced  to  300  ft.    A  minimum vertical  separation  of  500  ft  will  be  maintained  when  conducting  rendezvous  to  another  C-130 Exception:    A  minimum  vertical  separation  of  1,000  ft  will  be  maintained  between  tanker and receiver during tanker orbit rendezvous procedures with tilt-rotor receivers. simulating receiver. aircraft a  (T-2)     17.19.2.

(T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   139  17.19.3.  Minimum Visibility.  Minimum visibility for a visual rendezvous is 3 nm and 1 nm for electronic rendezvous.  (T-2) 17.20.  Formation  Procedures.  For  detailed  information  on  formation  procedures,  refer  to MDS-specific employment chapters. 17.20.1.  Ground operations.  Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length.  (T-2) 17.20.2.  Takeoff.    Minimum  takeoff  interval  is  15  seconds.    For  simultaneous  departures, aircraft separation must be at least 3,000 ft between aircraft.  Lead must have at least 3,500 ft of useable runway for takeoff.  Minimum visibility for formation takeoff is 1 mile (RVR 50). 17.20.3.  Rejoins.    Aircraft  joining  a  formation  en  route  will  rejoin  as  briefed  to  en  route position.  Otherwise, notify lead and remain at least 500 ft above or below the formation until the formation is in sight and clearance to rejoin is granted.  (T-2) 17.20.4.  En Route Procedures. 17.20.4.1.  Visual formation spacing will be no closer than 500 ft (200 foot close trail for qualified  MC-130P  crews).    En  route  spacing  will  normally  be  flown  between  500  – 6,000 ft between aircraft utilizing fluid trail geometry.  IMC formation spacing will be no closer than 6,000 ft.  (T-2) 17.20.4.2.  At night or in IMC, lead will announce unplanned airspeed changes of greater than 15 knots, unless briefed otherwise.  (T-2) 17.20.4.3.  Aircraft  aborting  after  assembly  will  notify  lead  and  turn  away  from formation.  The aborted aircraft will either rejoin at the end of the formation or proceed to a suitable recovery field.  Aircraft within a flight will reposition as briefed.  (T-2) 17.20.5.  Formation Objective Area Procedures. 17.20.5.1.  VMC.  MC-130 crews are authorized to conduct all high-speed and 50% flap airdrops  in  visual  formation  and  radar  trail.    Minimum  spacing  for  visual  formation airdrop is 2,000 ft (Exception:  MCADS minimum airdrop spacing is 500 ft).  Minimum spacing  for  reduced  flap  setting  drops,  i.e.,  CDS  and  CRS,  is  6,000  ft  between  aircraft.  Waiver authority for reduced airdrop spacing is the Group Commander or COMAFSOF.  (T-3) 17.20.5.2.  IMC.  Minimum spacing for formation IMC airdrops is 6,000 ft.  (T-2) 17.20.6.  Landings.  For 50% flap minimum interval landings, the desired landing interval is 20  seconds;  minimum  landing  interval  is  15  seconds.    For  100%  flap  minimum  interval landings, the desired landing interval is 30 second, minimum landing interval is 20 seconds.  Consider  extending  the  landing  interval  for  excessive  wind  conditions  or  wet/slippery runway conditions.  A combination of simultaneous and minimum interval landings may be planned.  Unless otherwise briefed, for other than simultaneous landings, bring throttles into the  ground  range  at  3,000  ft  remaining,  brakes  and  reverse  at  2,000  ft  remaining.    For simultaneous  landings,  followers  will  slow  to  a  safe  taxi  speed  prior  to  the  preceding aircraft's touchdown point.  Minimum spacing between simultaneous landing elements is 90 seconds.    Use  30  seconds  minimum  spacing  for  a  minimum  interval  element  following  a simultaneous  element.    Touch-and-go  landings  out  of  formation  recoveries  are  prohibited.  Minimum visibility for formation landing is 1 mile (RVR 50).  (T-2)   140  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 17.20.7.  Dissimilar Formations.  All AFSOC C-130 variants are authorized to fly formation with  other  AFSOC  C-130  aircraft  when  mission  requirements  dictate.    500  ft  lateral separation  is  the  minimum  spacing  for  different  MDS  aircraft.    For  formation  Tanker  Air Refueling,  use  geometries,  positions  and  lost  contact  procedures  described  in  ATP  56(B), parts  3  and  4.    For  formation  AAR  use  geometries  and  positions  described  in  ATP  56(B), parts 1 and 2.  (T-2) 17.20.8.  Command and Control.  Clear lines of command must be planned prior to formation flight.  Personnel in the following roles will be identified during mission planning and will be annotated on the flight orders (unless noted otherwise).  (T-2) 17.20.8.1.  Air  Mission  Commander  (AMC)  and  Deputy  Mission  Commander  (DMC).  For AMC and DMC formation duties see Paragraphs 2.7 and 2.8. 17.20.8.1.1.  Formation  Commander.    Required  on  every  formation  mission.    The designated  commander  of  a  formation  of  aircraft  is  responsible  for  the  successful completion  of  the  formation's  portion  of  the  mission  and  is  chosen  from  the  PICs, navigators,  and  EWOs  involved  in  the  mission.    The  formation  commander  works closely  with  the  AMC  (if  one  is  utilized)  to  accomplish  the  overall  mission,  and  is usually designated DMC on missions employing a dedicated AMC. 17.20.8.1.2.  Formation Lead.  The lead aircraft in a formation flight is responsible for proper mission execution and other immediate action events during a formation flight. 17.20.9.  Dissimilar Formation Briefings.  A face-to-face briefing between all involved crew members is highly desired.  At a minimum, dissimilar formation briefings must be attended by all PICs and at least one navigator from each crew.  When geographic separation between units  precludes  a  face-to-face  briefing,  the  AMC  will  coordinate  directly  with  each  PIC  to ensure  each  crew  receives  all  appropriate  formation  and  mission  information  prior  to  their individual crew briefings.  At a minimum, brief the following items:  (T-2) 17.20.9.1.  Communications,  air-to-air  TACAN  assignments,  aircraft  lighting,  power settings  (differences  between  H/P  and  J),  speeds,  inadvertent  weather  penetration,  and formation geometry.   Note:  Inadvertent weather penetration speeds for MC-130J range from 180 – 220 KCAS.  Speeds found in Paragraph 17.20.10 of this instruction should be used during dissimilar formations due to aircraft performance and limitations.  Inadvertent weather penetration speeds will be agreed upon and briefed prior to flight. apply: procedures 17.20.10.  Inadvertent  Weather  Penetration.    Upon  entering  marginal  VMC  or  IMC,  the following WARNING:  Inadvertent weather penetration procedures must be briefed.  These procedures are designed for use from trail formation during straight and level flight with no more than 3 aircraft.    It  may  be  necessary  to  modify  these  procedures  due  to  formation  geometries, terrain, airspace restrictions, etc.  Inadvertent weather penetration in mountainous terrain may be extremely hazardous.  Mission planners must devise and brief procedures that best suit the situation.   Note:    Inadvertent  weather  penetration  procedures  are  for  emergency  use  and  do  not constitute  authority  to  violate  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  or  Federal  Aviation  Regulations  (FAR).  Exercising  these  procedures  under  actual  weather  conditions  is  a  violation  subject  to  (T-2)     AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   141  appropriate  action  by  the  Air  Force  and  FAA.    Individual  aircraft  should  maintain  VFR  if there is sufficient warning to take evasive action.  Flight leads will take all practical measures to avoid entering controlled airspace without clearance. 17.20.10.1.  Wing  aircraft  immediately  initiates  a  climbing  turn  as  required  for  its position in the formation and gives "(Call Sign)” then “IMC Break" three times over the primary  interplane  radio.    The  lead  aircraft  responds  with  call  sign,  heading  and  base altitude.  Base altitude will be as follows:  MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor; or ESA, if not.  Note:  During training and exercise operations, the IMC Break call will be  made  on  a  non-secure  radio.    Lead’s  response  will  be  made  on  the  same  nonsecure radio by the Navigator (unless briefed otherwise), and the response should be called twice to ensure all wingmen copied the heading and altitude. 17.20.10.2.  All aircraft turn navigation lights to bright and turn transponder modes 1 and 3 to normal (if the threat environment allows). 17.20.10.3.  Lead  aircraft  sets  TIT  to  1,010°  C  (if  necessary)  and  climbs  at  180 KIAS/KCAS  straight  ahead  until  reaching  base  altitude  or  VMC  conditions,  whichever occurs first.  Upon reaching this altitude, maintain 180 KIAS/KCAS. 17.20.10.4.  The #2 aircraft immediately turns right 10 degrees or more (if feasible), sets TIT at 1,010° C (if necessary), and climbs at 170 KIAS/KCAS to base altitude plus 500 ft or VMC conditions, whichever occurs first.  After 30 seconds, resume original heading.  Upon reaching altitude, maintain 180 KIAS/KCAS. 17.20.10.5.  The  #3  aircraft  immediately  turns  left  10°  or  more  (if  feasible),  sets  TIT  at 1,010° C (if necessary), and climbs at 160 KIAS/KCAS to base altitude plus 1,000 ft or VMC  conditions,  whichever  occurs  first.    After  30  seconds,  resume  original  heading.  Upon reaching altitude, maintain 180 KIAS/KCAS. 17.20.10.6.  If  still  IMC  at  completion  of  the  maneuver,  wingmen  should  immediately maneuver  into  Radar  Trail  and  continue  on  track  using  radar  and  air-to-air  TACAN  to maintain position until VMC is encountered.  Recommended position of aircraft is in trail at 1 mile spacing.  If air-to-air TACAN is not operational, continuing with radar alone is permissible.    Note:    Lead  may  increase  cruise  airspeed  after  ensuring  all  aircraft  have completed their climb.  Accelerating helps keep the formation on time to its objective and makes transition to Radar Trail easier. visually after 17.20.10.7.  If  VMC  conditions  are  reencountered  and  can  be  maintained,  rejoin  the formation WARNING:  The direction of turn for IMC breaks is  based on a “no terrain” situation.  Terrain, threats, or fluid trail position may dictate a direction of turn different from what your  formation  position  calls  for.    Situational  awareness  is  critical  to  terrain  and  threat avoidance when weather is inadvertently encountered. permission obtaining from Lead.    17.20.11.  Preplanned Weather Penetration.  These procedures enable weather penetration en route to a VMC objective area.  They are designed to transition a formation from visual trail to Radar Trail prior to entering weather and permit continued formation flight in IMC.  Using these  procedures,  it  is  possible  to  fly  an  IMC  route  segment  at  a  preplanned  safe  altitude while still maintaining formation integrity.   142  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 17.20.11.1.  On  lead’s  signal,  lead  accelerates  20  KIAS/KCAS,  #2  maintains  en  route airspeed, and #3 reduces speed 20 KIAS/KCAS.  The formation maintains this airspeed differential  for  3  minutes,  then  resumes  en  route  airspeed.    This  should  establish approximately  1  mile  separation  between  aircraft.   On  the  same  signal,  lead maintains/climbs  to  base  altitude,  #2  climbs  at  1,000  ft  per  minute  to  base  altitude plus 500, and #3 climbs at 1,000 ft per minute to base altitude plus 1,000 ft.  Base altitude will be as follows:  MSA, if position is within the MSA corridor; ESA if outside the corridor, or  an  appropriate  en  route  altitude if  outside the  low-level environment.    Depending  on threat  environment,  altitudes  may  be  amended  (i.e.,  base  plus  100  ft,  base  plus  200 ft).  Note:  Radar  Trail requires the lead aircraft to  report all heading, altitude, and airspeed changes on interplane radio when operating in a permissive environment or requires these changes  be  thoroughly  preplanned  and  flown  precisely  when  operating  in  a  hostile, comm-out environment. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   143  Chapter 18 MC-130H EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 18.1.  General.  This chapter describes the specific equipment requirements, training restrictions, and regulatory guidance for employment procedures for the MC-130H Combat Talon II.  It is not a  stand-alone  reference  and  should  be  used  in  conjunction  with  AFTTP  3-3.MC-130  and  other directives.  In the case of any conflict between AFTTP 3-3.MC-130 and this regulation, AFI 11-2MC-130, Vol 3, takes precedence. 18.2.  Low-Level Procedures. 18.2.1.  Minimum Operating Equipment.

If all pilot VDTs are operational, both pilots will have an ADI selected at all times. 18.2.1.1.  The RALT OVRD function on the navigator/EWO E2 will only be used during VMC or combat/contingency operations.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   145  18.2.2.  Change  of  Control.    The  flying  pilot  will  initiate  the  change  of  control  and  state speed and steering reference when not following computer guidance.  (T-2) 18.2.3.  Altimeters.  The pilot, copilot, and navigator will acknowledge all manual changes in altimeter  setting.    If  TRUE  ALT  is  selected,  the  navigator  must  still  perform  the  required terminal  area  ALT  CALS.    Crew  members  will  monitor  TRUE  ALT  altimeter  settings  for accuracy.  The standby altimeters will be set to the lowest  forecast altimeter setting for the route or area of operations.  If TRUE ALT is selected, and the TRUE ALT altimeter setting falls  below  the  lowest  forecast  altimeter  setting,  the  TRUE  ALT  value  will  be  set  in  the standby  and  used  as  the  lowest  altimeter  setting  for  the  route  or  area  of  operations.    Use standby altimeters as the primary altitude reference when flying at MSA/ESA or reacting to an obstacle warning.  (T-2) 18.2.4.  Obstacle  Procedures.    Any  tower  or  man-made  obstruction  within  3  nm  of  planned flight path must be positively identified visually or on radar.  If not identified by 3 nm prior to the tower or obstacle, climb to at least 250 ft above the obstruction until clear.  (T-2) 18.2.5.  Terrain Following. 18.2.5.1.  Terrain  Following.    250  SCP  (500  ft  for  Ku-band  TF)  is  authorized  for  all terrain and meteorological conditions. 18.2.5.2.  IMC  Low-Level.    Crews  may  fly  low-level  in  IMC  provided  they  have  an operable  TA,  GM  or  PGM  display.    When  an  operable  TF  system  is  not  available,  the minimum altitude is MSA.  During training, conduct planned IMC routes under IFR on a published or surveyed route unless FLIP or host nation rules define other procedures.  (T-2) 18.2.5.3.  The nonflying pilot will alert the crew, select the desired SCP and set the radar altimeter  to  80%  of  SCP.    After  both  pilots  have  selected  TF  and  verified  TF  system tolerances  are  being  met,  they  can  intercept  selected  SCP  after  coordinating  with  the navigator WARNING:  Perform an inflight check of the TF system, and a level or cresting check, when  commencing  low-level  operations  to  ensure  the  system  is  operating  within tolerances.  If the TF system is flying out of limits low, TF operations will not be flown.  If  the  TF  system  is  flying  out  of  limits  high,  TF  operations  are  restricted  to  VMC.   Note:  Autopilot will not be used during low-level operations. EWO. or  (T-2)     18.2.6.  Visual, NVG, and Threat Penetration Low-Level. 18.2.6.1.  Minimum visibility to conduct NVG low-level is 3 sm.  (T-2) 18.2.6.2.  Set the RALT TF function to the desired altitude, no less than 300 ft (100 ft for threat  penetration  operations).    The  radar  altimeter  will  be  set  to  no  lower  than  80%  of this altitude.  (T-2) 18.2.6.3.  Prior  to  accepting  any  update,  the  navigator  will  inform  the  pilots  by  stating "Updating" followed by a heading or clearance to follow computer steering.  (T-2) 18.2.6.4.  Following  each  update,  time  and  conditions  permitting,  the  navigator  will determine  which  navigation  mode  is  most  accurate  (GPS/INS,  INS1,  INS2,  GPS,  etc.) and make the appropriate selection.  (T-2)   146  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 18.2.7.  Turn Point Procedures and Off Course Maneuvering. 18.2.7.1.  The navigator or EWO will provide the new course and MSA prior to the turn point.  The EWO will brief anticipated threats and aircraft deviations for the next leg.  (T-2) 18.2.7.2.  The  navigator  and  nonflying  pilot  share  the  primary  responsibility  of  clearing terrain in the direction of turn and no other duties must be allowed to interfere with this responsibility.  (T-2) 18.2.7.3.  Use caution whenever maneuvering in excess of 2 nm from the planned flight path, as terrain in the immediate area may exceed the MSA and terrain masking may be rendered  ineffective.    NVG  altitudes  may  also  be  inadequate  for  the  unexpected  flight path. 18.3.  Low-Level Emergency Procedures. Warning 18.3.1.  Obstacle WARNING:  These procedures are not written to allow crews to “visually” clear themselves while  reacting  to  a  TF  system  generated  OW.    Sound  judgment  and  clear  crew communication needs to be exercised throughout the execution of these maneuvers to quickly resolve the cause of an unplanned OW, regardless of its validity. (OW) Reactions.     18.3.1.1.  Straight ahead corridors.  The flying pilot will increase power towards max TIT (not to exceed 19,600 inch/pounds torque, if able), initiate a positive G pull-up (to attain a pitch approaching climb limit angle (CLA)) and begin a climb towards MSA, while the nonflying pilot, navigator and EWO cross-check all other available means to identify the cause  of  the  OW.    The  navigator/EWO  directing  the  navigation  will  provide  lateral guidance/direction in response to the determined cause of the OW.  The flying pilot will resume flying the system after receiving confirmation from the navigator/EWO directing the  navigation  the  TF  system  is  functioning  properly  (i.e.,  no  radar  system  fails  or pointing errors).  (T-2) 18.3.1.2.  Course  correction  and  turning  corridors.    If  the  OW  occurs  as  a  result  of exceeding  10°  angle  of  bank,  the  flying  pilot  will  immediately  lessen  the  bank  to  less than 10° while executing the steps outlined in Paragraph 18.3.1.1.  (T-2) 18.3.1.2.1.  If the cue returns after the reduction in bank angle to less than 10 degrees, the flying pilot will resume flying the system (i.e., no radar system fails or pointing errors).  (T-2) 18.3.1.2.2.  If the OW remains after the reduction in bank angle to less than 10°, the crew will continue with the procedures outlined in Paragraph 18.3.1.1.  (T-2) 18.3.2.  Planned  OW  Reactions.    Crews  will  thoroughly  brief  and  positively  identify  a  safe altitude, straight or turning path, distance to go and intended crew actions for the OW during preflight  planning  and  route  study.    Crews  will  execute  the  procedures  outlined  in Paragraph 18.3.1.1 if the OW occurs differently than planned.  (T-2) 18.3.3.  Avionics/Aircraft  Systems  Failure.    When  a  failure  of  the  selected  TF  system  or other  required  equipment  occurs  or  is  suspected  during  IMC  low-level  operations, the  pilot will  immediately  begin  a  climb  to  at  least  MSA  for  the  leg  or  segment  and  select  another low-level  method  (if  available).    Maintain  the  MSA  until  the  malfunction  is  corrected  and AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   147  not deselect continued  safe  low-level  operations  can  be  resumed.    When  the  failure cannot  be  corrected and  an  alternate  low-level  method  is  not  available,  discontinue  low-level  operations.    (T-2)   WARNING:  It is essential to verify terrain clearance prior to deselecting Radar TF.  In IMC, do CAUTION:  Due to possible system damage, do not use the X OVRD, KU OVRD and SPC OVRD  keys  on  the  navigator/EWO  E2  layer  except  during  actual  combat  or  contingency operations.     Note:    Weather  conditions  can  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  mission-essential  sensors  to  the point of effective failure.  If this occurs, comply with the appropriate emergency procedures. directing cue the is TF if a climb.    18.3.4.  Engine Failure. 18.3.4.1.  Discontinue low-level operations if feasible.  If terrain following is necessary, select the X-band radar TF/TA mode if available, verify the system is in the three-engine TF  mode,  check  the  route  of  flight  for  obstacles  which  could  exceed  available  climb performance, and select the highest SCP commensurate with the threat.  (T-2) 18.4.  Airdrop Operations. 18.4.1.  The engineer runs all airdrop checklists and will operate the flaps.  (T-2) 18.4.2.  The navigator may decide at any time to accomplish the drop visually, using NVGs if necessary.    For  ground  marked  release  system  (GMRS)  airdrops,  the  pilot  will  visually position the aircraft and call the release.  (T-2) 18.4.3.  The MSL altitude used on the drop leg  must be the true altitude for the drop (block 3 on  AF  Form  4015)  if  the  MC  BALT  setting  is  derived  by  inflight  altimeter  calibration.    If using a preflight altimeter use the indicated MSL altitude (block 8 on AF Form 4015). 18.4.4.  After the IP.  Upon departing the IP (or the slowdown point if one is programmed), the navigator, EWO, and pilots will confirm the MC is on a DROP or HARP leg.  (T-2) 18.4.5.  Slowdown.    Unless  otherwise  briefed,  reduce  power  to  1,000  in-lbs  of  torque  and depending  on  the  tactical  situation,  maintain  altitude  or  climb  immediately.    As  airspeed permits, extend flaps to 50%, slowing to drop airspeed.  If descent is required, reduce power to 1,000 in-lbs of torque and maintain level flight.  (T-2) 18.4.6.  The flying pilot may select TERM CNST at slowdown unless radar TF cues will be the planned airdrop altitude reference.  The non-flying pilot should normally retain radar TF vertical guidance in order to monitor terrain clearance (when practical).  The navigator will cross-check their manually-computed CARP/HARP with the MC-computed CARP/HARP to verify its accuracy.  (T-2) 18.4.7.  Crews will set the VDT radar altimeter to 50 ft below the briefed drop altitude when conducting  personnel  or  combination  airdrops,  and  should  set  50  ft  below  the  briefed  drop altitude  when conducting dual TERM CNST airdrops.  Otherwise, the VDT radar altimeter setting should be based on ensuring the aircraft is at the appropriate altitude during the run-in to the DZ (adequate terrain clearance for all ridge crossings) and across the DZ itself (ensure load  survivability).    The  planned  VDT  radar  altimeter  setting  and  use  of  the  TERM  CNST function WARNING:  Prior to selection of TERM CNST, careful evaluation of all sensors (or visual references)  will  be  made  by  the  nonflying  pilot,  navigator,  and  EWO  to  ensure  the  MC thoroughly briefed. will be  (T-2)       148  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 guidance will not direct the aircraft into terrain.  The MC will command a descent if TERM CNST is selected above the programmed DROP leg altitude.  The DROP leg altitude could be set below the  minimum en route altitude  required for the terrain, weather,  and degraded equipment conditions actually encountered. 18.5.  SCA Procedures. 18.5.1.  Crew Duties.  Normally the copilot flies the SCA and the pilot assumes control for the landing.  During  NVG operations, an NVG landing qualified  pilot (non-instructor) may takeoff and land from the right seat provided an NVG landing qualified pilot is in the left seat and  normal  (non-assault)  procedures  are  used.    In  this  case,  either  pilot  may  fly  the  SCA, with the other pilot accomplishing the landing and subsequent takeoff.  Instructor pilots may fly  both  the  SCA  and  landing  for  demonstration  purposes.    During  day  operations  or  overt night operations to lit runways, either pilot may fly the SCA and landing.  (T-2) 18.5.1.1.  The  navigator/EWO  will  determine  the  most  accurate  altimeter  setting  for  the LZ using all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station reporting and  altitude  calibration,  as  available.    Use this altimeter  setting in  the MC  BALT.    The standby altimeters will normally remain set at the lowest altimeter setting for the route or route segment.  (T-2) 18.5.1.2.  The  flight  engineer  will  have  NVGs  ready  for  immediate  use.    The  nonflying pilot will back up the flying pilot on the displays and confirm terrain clearance using all means  available.    The  nonflying  pilot  and  flight  engineer  will  clear  for  obstacles  and other traffic.  (T-2) 18.5.2.  At the Initial Point. 18.5.2.1.  The  navigator/EWO  will  verify  final  course  guidance  accuracy.    The  pilots, navigator, and EWO will confirm the system is in the APPR mode.  (T-2) 18.5.2.2.  The navigator/EWO will confirm LZ alignment with GM/PGM radar and IDS and give final headings as required.  (T-2) 18.5.3.  Slowdown. 18.5.3.1.  Slowdown  should  normally  be  initiated  no  closer  than  3  nm  prior  to  the planned  glide  slope  intercept  point  unless  previously  briefed.    The  navigator/EWO  will initiate  the  slowdown.    Maintain  a  minimum  of  50%  threshold  speed  (50%  approach speed  for  turning)  until  landing  gear  is  down  and  tracking  flaps  to  100%.    The  FE  will state  “Tracking”  once  cleared  for  50%  flaps.    When  the  flaps  reach  50%  and  airspeed passes 165 KIAS, the FE will state “Landing Gear”.  As soon as gear is down the FE will state “Gear Down, Flaps” and standby for clearance to set flaps to 100%.  Upon receiving clearance  to  move  flaps,  the  FE  will  state  “Tracking”  and  resume  the  INFIL/EXFIL BEFORE LANDING checklist at the “Landing Gear” step.  (T-2) 18.5.3.2.  Do  not  slow  to  threshold  speed  until  established  on  final  for  both  straight-in and turning SCAs.  For turning SCAs, maintain 140 KCAS or approach speed for given aircraft configuration, whichever is higher in the turn.  Once the slowdown is initiated, no further airspeed corrections for TOA control should be made.  (T-2) 18.5.4.  Altimeters.    The  nonflying  pilot  will  set  the  radar  altimeter  to  the  MDA  (HAT).  Throughout  the  approach,  the  pilot  will  monitor  radar/barometric  altimeters  to  ensure AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   149  terrain clearance appropriate WARNING:    The  obstacle  clearance  procedures  in  this  chapter  are  not  applicable  to  NVG operations conducted in a visual pattern.  The pilot must maintain visual contact with the LZ and with surrounding terrain in order to execute a successful approach. landing. taking until over the for  (T-2)     18.5.5.  One Mile Prior to Glide Slope Intercept. 18.5.5.1.  When  approaching  the  glide  path  (or prebriefed  distance  to  go),  the  navigator or  EWO  will  clear  the  pilots  to  select  TERM  CNST  after  cross-checking  all  available sensors  for  significant  terrain.    The  copilot  will  select  TERM  CNST  after  receiving clearance/confirmation WARNING:    The  navigator  will  verify  the actual  aircraft  position  is inside the  planned SCA  obstacle  template  prior  to  initiating  descent  (and  prior  to  pilots  selecting  terminal consent).

The  flying  pilot  will  begin  descent  following  the  flight director  cue  unless  directed  otherwise  by  the  navigator/EWO,  nonflying  pilot,  or  flight engineer.    The  flying  pilot  will  not  descend  the  aircraft  below  MSL  MDA  until  the touchdown  zone WARNING:  The nonflying pilot, navigator, and EWO must closely monitor radar altimeters to ensure accuracy of altimeter settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums. identified  and  confirmed  by  both  pilots. is  visually  (T-2)     18.5.6.1.  At glide slope intercept the navigator/EWO will monitor course and glide slope deviation using the VSD or HSD display.  Report deviations greater than 50 yds laterally (not  required  during  turning  SCAs)  or  50  ft  vertically,  along  with  an  advisory  as  to whether the aircraft is correcting to, paralleling or diverging from course/glide path.  (T-2) 18.5.6.2.  Upon  completion  of  the  final  position  update,  the  navigator/EWO  will  verify the  runway  has  been  correctly  identified  and  is  clear  of  obstructions  and  should  set  the IDS to FPV mode and MED FOV.  (T-2) 18.5.7.  Level Off/Minimums. 18.5.7.1.  Level  off  at  MDA  if  the  nonflying  pilot  has  not  taken  control  of  the  aircraft.  The  flying  pilot  will  maintain  the  MDA  until  the  nonflying  pilot  takes  control  of  the aircraft or until reaching the MAP (system position distance-to-go is 0.0 or as briefed by the  navigator/EWO).    The  nonflying  pilot  may  direct  the  flying  pilot to  the  LZ  (remain at/above MDA) or may maneuver the aircraft himself.  (T-2) 18.5.7.2.  IMC/VMC  SCA.    Do  not  descend  below  MDA  until  the  touchdown  zone  is visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.  (T-2) 18.5.8.  Visual Acquisition of the LZ. 18.5.8.1.  The flight engineer will assist in field acquisition and visually check the LZ is clear. 18.5.8.2.  Aircraft lighting will be as briefed/directed by ground parties for authentication purposes.    The  use  of  covert  lighting  will  be  thoroughly  briefed  in  respect  to  threat, runway environment, and authentication procedures.  (T-2)   150  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 18.5.9.  After Touchdown. 18.5.9.1.  The  copilot  and  flight  engineer  will  assist  the  pilot  in  locating  the offload/onload  point  once  taxi  speed  is  reached  and  clear  for  other  aircraft  and obstructions.  If the pilot makes the landing from the right seat, the pilot in the left seat will be prepared to assume aircraft control once taxi speed is reached.  (T-2) 18.5.10.  Go-Around Procedures. 18.5.10.1.  The  navigator/EWO  will  advise  the  pilots  upon  arriving  at  the  MAP  and repeat the terrain clearance altitude (e.g., radar TF SCP, RALT TF, MSL altitude, pattern altitude,  etc.),  the  initial  heading,  and  will  call  altitudes  climbing  through  from  50  ft  to 200 ft AGL (i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200) if a go-around is executed.  (T-2) 18.5.10.2.  The flight engineer will monitor engine instruments, airspeed, altitude, rate of climb, configuration, and terrain clearance.  (T-2) 18.5.10.3.  Go-Around-Immediate  Landing  Feasible.    The  pilot  will  state  "Go-Around, Immediate Landing Feasible".  After establishing a safe climb, the flying pilot will direct the flaps set to 50%.  The flying pilot will call for 100% flaps before or after rolling off the perch and call for the appropriate checklist.  The engineer will pick up the checklist by reconfirming the landing gear position and accomplishing the remaining items of the checklist.  Maintain 140 KCAS or approach speed, whichever is higher until established on final.  (T-2) 18.5.10.3.1.  This  maneuver  should  only  require  the  movement  of  flaps  and  landing light switches.  If any other change in configuration is accomplished, then the entire checklist will be used.  (T-2) 18.5.10.3.2.  The go-around (G/A) button will be activated if terrain near the airfield dictates  use of TF  to  safely fly visually back  to the runway.  The pilot's  decision to use  the  go-around  button  should  be  coordinated  with  the  navigator/EWO  during preflight WARNING:    Be  aware  after  G/A  is  selected,  radar  TF  will  not  be  active,  nor  will lateral WARNING:  If G/A is not selected and the system remains in the APPR leg, the pilot must fly the MSL altitude directed by the navigator/EWO to ensure terrain clearance.  The cue will not give reliable vertical guidance until reestablished on the glide slope. planning. selected until steering begin the SCP is reached.     (T-2)     18.5.10.3.3.  If the G/A button was selected, TERM CNST must be selected prior to descending below the selected SCP to prevent a LOW ALT.  (T-2) 18.5.11.  Takeoff Procedures. 18.5.11.1.  Accomplish  the  ON  THE  RUNWAY  portion  of  the  INFIL/EXFIL  checklist.  If a visual pattern or turning SCA back to the LZ is to be accomplished, use the ON THE RUNWAY touch-and-go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, if desired.  Use the normal checklist  procedures  IAW  TO  1C-130(M)H-1,  when  not  using  the  INFIL/EXFIL checklist.  (T-2) 18.5.11.2.  The  navigator/EWO  will  provide  a  departure  heading,  altitude,  and  terrain considerations. Note:  For departures into TF en route procedures, the navigator/EWO will program an (T-2)    AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   151  APPR  leg  on  the  ground  to  ensure  the  selection  of  G/A  results  in  an  active  TF  system with valid steering. 18.5.11.3.  The  flying  pilot  will  make  the  takeoff  wearing  NVGs.    The  nonflying  pilot will wear  NVGs and be prepared to fly the planned departure on NVGs or  transition to instruments and fly the navigator’s directions in the event of NVG failure.  (T-2) 18.5.11.4.  Use  IR  taxi  and  landing  lights  to  the  minimum  extent  required  to  maintain visual references during takeoff roll.  Interior lighting is the same as for the approach and landing.  The flight engineer will clear the LZ for obstacles.  (T-2) 18.5.11.5.  Use  normal  takeoff  performance  unless  max  effort  performance  is  required.  At  refusal  speed,  the  copilot  will  call  "Go".    At  takeoff  speed,  the  copilot  will  call "Rotate".  If takeoff and refusal speed are equal, the copilot will call "Go".  (T-2) 18.5.11.6.  At takeoff speed, the pilot will rotate the aircraft to establish a positive climb rate.    The  copilot  checks  the  pitch  attitude  and  will  raise  the  landing  gear  on  the command  of  the  pilot  after  ensuring  a  positive  rate  of  climb.    The  flight  engineer  will back  up  the  pilot  using  NVGs  during  climb  out.    The  copilot  may  take  control  of  the aircraft  if  directed  by  the  pilot  and  continue  the  climb  out  to  the  egress  route  altitude.  The  flying  pilot  directs  the  accomplishment  of  the  appropriate  AFTER  TAKEOFF checklist.  (T-2) 18.5.11.6.1.  At or before takeoff speed, the pilot will select MC G/A mode.  (T-2) 18.5.11.7.  The navigator/EWO will advise the pilots of the initial on course heading and call altitudes climbing through from 50 ft to 200 ft AGL (i.e., 50, 100, 150, 200).  (T-2) 18.5.11.8.  As  soon  as  conditions  permit,  the  loadmaster  will  check  equipment  restraint and condition/needs of the onboard user.  (T-2) 18.6.  Defensive Maneuvering. 18.6.1.  When  operating  in  VMC,  pilots  must  clear  terrain  prior  to  and  during  any  threat reaction.  (T-2) 18.6.2.  When operating in IMC, the EWO or navigator will use the GM or PGM to clear for terrain  prior  to  calling  a  turn  or  break  that  requires  a  faster  turn  rate  than  the  radar  turning scan capability.  In IMC, the navigator may clear the pilot up to a 30° bank angle using this method.

Unless an emergency fuel condition exists, receiver crews will not attempt probe to drogue contact in a turn at night.  Once in contact, turns are permitted.  (T-2) 18.9.  Radar Trail Procedures. 18.9.1.  Type  and  Size.    Radar  trail  formation  is  normally  flown  in  two  or  three  ship elements, with each successive element separated by one minute.  The squadron CC/DO may authorize  20 second  spacing  between  elements  for  phases  of  the  mission  where  reduced separation is required. 18.9.2.  Weather Minimums.  IMC rejoins are not authorized during training.  (T-2) 18.9.3.  Altitudes.  Comply with Chapter  17 altitude restrictions.  Threat Penetration is not authorized during peacetime in radar trail formation.  (T-2) 18.9.4.  Aircraft  Lighting.    If  preceding  aircraft  have  other  than  full  external  lighting,  all crews will use NVGs.  Formation and position lights set to dim, lower anticollision light and the  IR  rotating  beacon  on,  are  required  for  NVG  formation  operations  in  an  ATC environment.  (T-2) 18.9.5.  Acceleration.    Use  a  common  reference  for  formation  acceleration  (e.g.,  time  or geographic point).  If elapsed time is used, begin timing when lead starts takeoff roll. 18.9.6.  En Route Rejoin Procedures. 18.9.6.1.  General.  No more than three aircraft will rejoin at the same geographic point.  Plan  to  rejoin  30  seconds  in  trail  then  close  to  the  briefed  spacing  (no  closer  than  20 seconds).  (T-2) 18.9.6.2.  Rejoin  Abort.    If  a  crew  determines  they  will  miss  their  rejoin  time  of  arrival (TOA) by greater than 10 seconds, they will inform lead.  The late aircraft will climb to a predetermined MSL altitude (threat allowing) and attempt  to  join the formation  as  soon as possible, but prior to the IP.  Follow briefed instructions if proper formation position cannot  be  established  prior  to  the  IP.    If  any  aircraft  experiences  aircraft/equipment problems just prior to the rejoin, they may elect to rejoin at the end of the formation or proceed  to  a  suitable  recovery  airfield.    Remaining  aircraft  within  the  formation  will reposition as instructed by the formation leader to close the formation.  (T-2) 18.9.7.  En Route Procedures. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   153  18.9.7.1.  Airspeed/Groundspeed  Changes.    Airspeed  and  groundspeed  changes  should occur  at the  same  geographic  point  referenced  by  a  Navigation  Reference  Point  (NRP).  Use  timed  spacing  off  of  serial  lead  as  a  backup  or  when  NRP  is  unavailable.    This ensures proper timed spacing is maintained. 18.9.7.2.  Formation  Positioning.    Formation  navigators  will  plan  and  brief  the  latest allowable time to a turn point and the subsequent actions to be taken if this time cannot be Note:  Using PGM at high-altitude will result in increased spacing due to the slant range computations.  TA and weather (WX) presentations will reflect the actual aircraft in-trail position.   Note:    During  high  level  ops,  formation  aircraft  may  use  autopilot  to  relieve  crew  task loading.  Autopilot during low-level ops will not be used. made.  (T-2)    18.9.8.  Formation Airdrops.  For visual formation airdrop spacing, see Chapter 17.  Normal radar  trail  airdrop  spacing  is  20  second  trend  dot  spacing  for  all  high-speed  and  50%  flap setting  drops.    During  contingencies,  close-interval  CDS/CRS  airdrops  may  be  flown  using less  than  30 second  trend  dot  spacing  with  Group  Commander/COMAFSOF  approval.    30 second trend dot spacing equates to the 6,000 ft spacing requirement outlined in Chapter 17. 18.9.9.  Formation Air-to-Air Refueling.  Lead aircraft is responsible for weather avoidance during the rendezvous until 0.5 nm from contact position.  Any aircraft in the formation may advise the formation of inclement weather on the refueling track.   154  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 Chapter 19 MC-130P EMPLOYMENT PROCEDURES 19.1.  General.  This chapter describes the specific  equipment  requirements and restrictions for MC-130P  Combat  Shadow  employment.    It  provides  directives  for  aircraft  employment  and operational procedures found in AFTTP 3-3.MC-130, AFTTP 3-1., and other instructions.  In the case  of  any  conflict  between  AFTTP  and  this  regulation,  AFI  11-2MC-130,  Vol  3,  takes precedence. 19.2.  Minimum  Operating  Equipment.  Refer  to  Table  19.1,  Tactical  Operations,  for minimum  tactical  equipment.

Degraded  Systems  Restrictions/Procedures.    Degraded  Systems  Training  (DST)  is used  to  prepare  crews  to  accomplish  the  mission  simulating  certain  pieces  of  equipment inoperative  (or  intentionally  turned  off  for  emission  control).    Specifically,  DST  serves  the purpose of training, via simulation of inoperative equipment.  Designate DST route segments during the route brief.  DST will not be performed by inexperienced crews, and will be taken into  consideration  during  the  ORM  assessment.    The  following  restrictions  and  procedures are designed to maximize training and safety.  (T-2) 19.2.1.1.  DST Specific Restrictions: 19.2.1.2.  PICs  will  brief  the  equipment  simulated  as  inoperative,  aircrew  coordination, crew duties, and disorientation/emergency procedures prior to flight.  (T-3) 19.2.1.3.  Visibility must be at least 5 sm in mountainous terrain.  (T-2) 19.2.1.4.  Illumination:  Effective illumination must be greater than 10% or DST must be conducted between the forecasted hours of sunset and estimated end of nautical twilight (EENT).    Effective  illumination  must  be  greater  than  25%  if  a  safety  observer  is  not aboard  IAW  Paragraph  19.2.1.9.    Otherwise,  DST  may  be  conducted  between  the forecasted hours of sunset and EENT.  (T-2) 19.2.1.5.  Equipment/Personnel Requirements:  (T-2) 19.2.1.5.1.  Radar  Altimeter.    The  aircraft’s  radar  altimeter  must  be  operational  and on during the entire flight.  Additionally, both pilot and navigator indicators must be fully functioning. 19.2.1.5.2.  Ground  Mapping  (GM)/Weather  Radar.    The  radar  must  be  fully functional  before  flight.    The  navigator  will  function  check  the  radar  periodically during DST NVG low-level operations to verify functionality.  If at any time during the function check it is determined that the radar will not sufficiently provide terrain avoidance, DST operations will be discontinued.  At this time tactical operations will revert to restrictions provided in Table 19.1. 19.2.1.5.3.  Navigation equipment.  The SCNS INS or GPS must be operational and on during DST.  A GPS moving map laptop with PFPS and DTED installed may be employed  by  the  navigator.    DTED  coverage  should  encompass  the  planned  flight area within 25 nm of course centerline. if  not  manning 19.2.1.5.4.  Personnel:  A mission qualified instructor pilot must be at the controls.  A mission  instructor/evaluator  navigator  must  be  on  board.    The  instructor/evaluator navigator, in  an instructor/evaluator capacity.  Restriction:  During NVG low-level radar denied DST operation, a second mission qualified navigator (or mission qualified pilot) will act as the safety observer, and will monitor  the progress  of the mission  using NVGs.  The scanner will wear NVGs and carry an additional low-level chart. the  navigator  position,  will  be  acting 19.2.2.  Procedures:  (T-2) 19.2.2.1.  Single  Radar  Altimeter  Operations.    For  single  radar  altimeter  operations  the navigator’s radar altimeter repeater only will be placed to off and the nonflying pilot and   156  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 flight  engineer  will  assume  all  responsibilities  for  radar  altimeter  altitude  calls referencing  the  pilot’s  radar  altimeter  as  directed  by  the  PIC.    Equipment/Personnel requirements must be met IAW Paragraph 19.2.1.5. low-level, radar  denied  operations 19.2.2.2.  Radar  Denied  Operations.    The  radar  will  be  placed  in  the  standby  position during  NVG simulate  an inoperative/unavailable  radar.    A  safety  observer  will  be  on  board  IAW  Paragraph 19.2.1.9.  Having the radar in standby will allow a quick transition to normal NVG low-level procedures during limited visibility or in emergency situations (inadvertent weather penetration, emergency climb, etc.).  The navigator will turn on the radar any time cloud cover  degrades  effective  illumination  inflight.    Equipment/Personnel  requirements  must be met IAW Paragraph 19.2.1.5. in  order to denied/degraded 19.2.2.3.  Simulated  SCNS   Simulated  SCNS denial/degradation  maybe  accomplished  during  any  phase  of  flight  regardless  of  the illumination.    Additionally,  any  crew  position  integrated  display  computer  unit  (IDCU) may  be  dimmed. the copilots/navigator’s  charts  and  moving  map  PFPS.    If  any  crew  member  becomes disoriented  an  immediate  climb  to  ESA  must  be  accomplished.    Equipment/Personnel requirements must be met IAW Paragraph 19.2.1.5.   The  crews  primary  navigational references  become operations. 19.3.  En Route Operations. 19.3.1.  The pilot and copilot may share a single low-level chart during flight.  If this option is  used,  both  the  pilot  and  copilot  must  participate  in  pre-mission  route  analysis  using  the single chart.  (T-2) 19.3.1.1.  IMC Low-Level.  The minimum en route altitude is MSA for the planned route.  During training, conduct planned IMC routes under IFR on a published or surveyed route unless FLIP or host nations rules define other procedures. 19.3.2.  The  radar  altimeter  will  be  set  to  no  lower  than  10%  below  the  planned  en  route altitude for low-level operations.  (For example, the radar altimeter will not be set below 450 ft when  flying 500 ft  NVG contour).  The pilot and navigator  will use  the same setting for their Exception:  When authorized per MDS TO checklists.  (T-2) radar altimeters.   19.3.3.  Radar  Altimeter  Low  Lights.    Any  crew  member  noting  illumination  of  the  low warning  light  on  the  radar  altimeter  will  call  “Low”  to  indicate  this  to  the  flying  pilot.  WARNING:  Lack of immediate action could result in controlled flight into terrain (CFIT).  WARNING:    The  radar  altimeter  may  indicate  a  higher  altitude  than  the  aircraft's  actual clearance  overwater,  due Note:    Regardless  of  the  radar  altimeter  setting  you  use,  if  you  are  below  the  desired modified contour altitude, a correction to altitude should be made.  Do not wait for the low light to illuminate to begin a correction.  This is especially important when using the lower limit on the radar altimeter.  (T-2) the  water  surface.   from  beneath to  energy reflected 19.4.  Airdrop Operations. 19.4.1.  SCNS Airdrop (AD)/Troop Jump (TJ) Computer-Manual Select Switch will be set to AD/TJ manual.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   157  19.4.2.  The Radar Altimeter will be set to no lower than 50 ft below planned drop altitude.  Exception:  High-Altitude Airdrops.  (T-2) 19.4.3.  High-speed  operations  with  the  paratroop  doors  open  will  not  be  accomplished during training missions.  (T-2) 19.4.4.  A maximum of six static line parachutists may be deployed out a paratroop door that has  a  Benson  tank  installed  on  that  side.    Consideration  should  be  given  to  the  amount  of equipment each parachutist will carry. 19.4.5.  IMC Airdrops. 19.4.5.1.  IMC Airdrop Procedures.  The following procedures may be practiced in VMC.  IMC airdrop from the MC-130P requires SOG/CC approval.  (T-3) 19.4.5.2.  IMC  Drop  Altitude.    Fly  minimum  IMC  drop  altitudes  at  500  ft  above  the highest obstruction to flight (man-made obstruction, terrain feature, or spot elevation), or 400 ft plus one contour interval above the highest depicted terrain contour, whichever is highest, within 3 nm either side of the run-in centerline from DZ entry point to DZ exit point or as specified in AFI 11-231, whichever is higher.  The IMC drop altitude may be segmented per AFTTP 3-3.MC-130. 19.4.5.3.  DZ Entry Point.  The DZ entry point is a fixed point on DZ run-in course where an aircraft or formation of aircraft may safely begin descent from IMC en route altitude to IMC drop altitude.  The DZ entry point is a maximum of 40 nm prior to the DZ exit point according to FAA FAR exemption 4371C.  Formation descent will not begin until the last aircraft in the formation is at or past the DZ entry point.  (T-2) 19.4.5.4.  DZ Exit Point.  The DZ exit point is a fixed point on the DZ escape flight path centerline, established during pre-mission planning, at which the formation will be at the minimum  IMC  en  route  altitude.    Calculate  the  exit  point  based  upon  three-engine performance at airdrop gross weight.  This point will be planned no less than 4 nm track distance beyond the DZ trailing edge.  (T-2) 19.4.5.5.  Earliest Descent Point (EDP).  The earliest descent point is the earliest point on the DZ run-in course where the lead aircraft may begin IMC descent to IMC drop altitude and be assured of terrain clearance for the entire formation.  Compute EDP by subtracting formation length from the computed DZ entry point. 19.4.5.6.  In IMC, drop clearance is confirmed via radio call or beacon acquisition. 19.4.5.7.  To  position  the  aircraft  accurately  at  the  release  point,  use  the  following pilot/navigator procedures:  (T-2) 19.4.5.7.1.  Upon departing the IP (or the slowdown point if one is programmed), the LN  and  pilots  will  confirm  that  the  airdrop  leg  and  sensitive  steering  are  active.  Normally,  navigate  to  the  DZ  using  SCNS  guidance.    Once  on  final  run-in  course, position updates will correct steering information supplied to the flight directors.  The LN  will  confirm  DZ  alignment  with  radar  and  IDS  if  available  and  provide  final headings  off  steering  if  required.    The  pilot  flying  will  steer  to  the  CARP/HARP using  the  flight  director  system  or  follow  the  navigator's  headings.    The  LN  will confirm  SCNS  position  using  preplanned  update  points  and  provide  corrections  if required.    Normally,  the  LN  will  provide  course  guidance,  distance  to  go,  and  drift   158  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 information approximately every mile during the run-in.  The RN must be prepared at any  time  along  the  run -in  to  assume  navigation,  make  all  required  calls,  and accomplish the drop visually using NVGs if capable. 19.4.5.8.  At the release point.  The  nonflying pilot and the LN will confirm the aircraft is  positioned  within  the  pre-briefed  visual  safety  box  during  VMC  operations.    Both pilots  and  both  navigators  will  confirm  the  aircraft  is  positioned  within  the  pre-briefed IMC safety box (i.e., ± 200 yds, ± 3 secs) for IMC operations. 19.5.  SCA Procedures. 19.5.1.  Ensure the radar is operational, no less than a GPS of figure of merit (FOM)-2, and a system  update  and  altimeter  update  are  conducted  within  10  minutes  of  starting  the  IMC SCA.  (T-2) 19.5.2.  IMC  SCA  Altitude.    Fly  minimum  IMC  SCA  altitudes  at  500  ft  above  the  highest obstruction  to  flight  within  2  nm  either  side  of  the  run-in  centerline  from  10  nm  or  IP  to Begin  Descent  point  whichever  is  closer  to  the  LZ.    The  IMC  SCA  altitude  may  be segmented.  (T-2) 19.5.3.  Crew Duties. 19.5.3.1.  The pilot flying will steer to the LZ using the flight director system or follow the navigator's headings.  The LN will confirm SCNS position using preplanned update points and provide corrections if required.  The right navigator will confirm LZ centerline alignment  on  short  final  using  all  available  means  and  correct  aircraft  alignment  if required.  (T-2) 19.5.3.2.  The  navigator  will  determine  the  most  accurate  altimeter  setting  for  the  LZ using all available sources including GPS, weather forecasts, ground station reporting and altitude  calibration,  as  available.    Once  on  final  run-in  course,  position  updates  will correct steering information supplied to the flight directors.  (T-2) 19.5.3.3.  The  flight  engineer  will  have  NVGs  ready  for  immediate  use.    The  nonflying pilot  will  back  up  the  flying  pilot  on  the  instruments/displays  and  confirm  terrain clearance  using  all  means  available.    The  flying  pilot  and  flight  engineer  will  clear  for obstacles and other traffic.  (T-2) 19.5.4.  At the Initial Point. 19.5.4.1.  The  left  navigator  will  make  distance  calls  at  every  mile  inside  ten  miles  and every half mile inside three miles (or as briefed).  (T-2) 19.5.4.2.  The left navigator will confirm LZ alignment with radar and IDS and give final headings as required.  (T-2) 19.5.5.  Slowdown. 19.5.5.1.  Slowdown  should  be  initiated  approximately  3  nm  prior  to  the  planned  glide slope intercept point.  The navigator will initiate the slowdown.  (T-2) 19.5.5.2.  Do  not  slow  to  threshold  speed  until  established  on  final  for  both  straight-in and turning SCAs.  For turning SCAs, maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed whichever AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   159  is higher in the turn.  Once the slowdown is initiated, no further airspeed corrections for TOA control should be made. 19.5.6.  Altimeters.    Radar  altimeters  should  remain  set  at  en  route  altitude  setting  until slowdown.  Once slowdown is initiated, the radar altimeters  may be reset as briefed by the pilot.  The left navigator will maintain en route setting until the “Begin Descent” call is made and WARNING:    The  obstacle  clearance  procedures  in  this  chapter  are  not  applicable  to  NVG operations conducted in a visual pattern.  The pilot must maintain visual contact with the LZ and with surrounding terrain in order to execute a successful approach.

The  pilot  flying  will  begin  descent  upon  navigator direction unless  directed otherwise by the navigator,  pilot, or flight engineer.   The pilot flying WARNING:  The nonflying pilot, LN, and RN must closely monitor radar altimeters to ensure accuracy of altimeter settings to prevent inadvertently flying below planned AGL minimums.  (T-2) descend aircraft below MSL will not the MDA.   19.5.7.3.  At glide slope intercept the left navigator will state “Begin Descent” and state the desired initial descent rate.  The left navigator, backed up by the right navigator, will provide  glidepath  advisories  referenced  from  navigator’s  pressure  and  radar  altimeters backed up by SCNS.  These calls will be made at 1/2 nm intervals until reaching the “100 ft”  or  “Minimums”  call.    State  deviations  in  excess  of  100  ft  above  and  50  ft  below explicitly.    The  left  navigator  also  advises  the  pilot  if  the  aircraft  is  correcting  to  or diverging from glide path and how rapidly if appropriate.  Descending below minimums, the  left  navigator  will  call  “100”,  “50”,  “25”,  and  “10”  ft  off  the  radar  altimeter,  to provide the flying pilot an audible rate of descent.  (T-2) 19.5.8.  Level Off/Minimums. 19.5.8.1.  Do not descend below MDA until the LZ environment is identified visually and confirmed  by  both  pilots.    Whoever  identifies  the  LZ  first  will  call  “Zone  In  Sight”, relative clock position and any discrepancies (i.e., lights out, etc.).  Both pilots will then confirm the zone and cross-check the alignment for the proper heading.  (T-2) 19.5.8.2.  VMC SCA.  Do not descend below 100 ft until the touchdown zone is visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.  (T-2) 19.5.8.3.  IMC SCA.  Do not descend below 300 ft until the LZ environment is positively identified,  either  visually  or  on  the  IDS.    Do  not  descend  below  200  ft  until  the  LZ environment is visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.  (T-2) 19.5.9.  Visual Acquisition of the LZ.   160  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 19.5.9.1.  The flight engineer will assist in field acquisition and visually check the LZ is clear.  (T-2) 19.5.9.2.  Aircraft lighting will be as briefed/directed by ground parties for authentication purposes.    The  use  of  covert  lighting  will  be  thoroughly  briefed  in  respect  to  threat, runway environment, and authentication procedures.  (T-2) 19.5.10.  After Touchdown.   The copilot  and flight  engineer will assist the pilot  in  locating the  offload/onload  point  once  taxi  speed  is  reached  and  clear  for  other  aircraft  and obstructions.  If the pilot makes the landing from the right seat, the pilot in the left seat will be prepared to assume aircraft control once taxi speed is reached.  (T-2) 19.5.11.  Go-Around Procedures. 19.5.11.1.  The  left  navigator  calls  “Missed  Approach”  at  the  pre-briefed  missed approach  point    and  repeat  the  terrain  clearance  altitude  (e.g.,  MSL  altitude,  pattern altitude, etc.), the initial heading, and will call altitudes climbing from 100 ft through 300 ft AGL (i.e., 100, 200, 300) if a go-around is executed.  (T-2) 19.5.11.2.  The flight engineer will monitor engine instruments, airspeed, altitude, rate of climb, configuration, and terrain clearance.  (T-2) 19.5.11.3.  Immediate  Landing  Feasible.    The  pilot  will  state  "Go-Around,  Immediate Landing  Feasible".   After  establishing a safe climb, the pilot  flying will direct the flaps set to 50%.  The pilot flying will call for 100% flaps before or after rolling off the perch (if  required)  and  call  for  the  appropriate  checklist.    The  engineer  will  pick  up  the checklist  by  reconfirming  the  landing  gear  position  and  accomplishing  the  remaining items of the checklist.  Maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed, whichever is higher until established on final.  (T-2) 19.5.11.3.1.  This  maneuver  should  only  require  the  movement  of  flaps  and  landing light switches.  If any other change in configuration is accomplished, then the entire checklist will be used.  (T-2) 19.5.12.  Takeoff Procedures. 19.5.12.1.  Accomplish  the  ON  THE  RUNWAY  portion  of  the  INFIL/EXFIL  checklist.  If a visual pattern or turning SCA back to the LZ is to be accomplished, use the ON THE RUNWAY touch-and-go steps of the INFIL/EXFIL checklist, if desired.  Use the normal checklist  procedures  IAW  applicable  TO  1C-130(M)P-1,  when  not  using the INFIL/EXFIL checklist.  (T-2) 19.5.12.2.  The  navigator  will  provide  a  departure  heading,  altitude,  and  terrain considerations.  (T-2) 19.5.12.3.  The  pilot  flying  will  make  the  takeoff  wearing  NVGs.    The  nonflying  pilot will wear  NVGs and be prepared to fly the planned departure on NVGs or  transition to instruments and fly the navigator’s directions in the event of NVG failure.  (T-2) 19.5.12.4.  Use  IR  taxi  and  landing  lights  to  the  minimum  extent  required  to  maintain visual references during takeoff roll.  Interior lighting is the same as for the approach and landing.  The flight engineer will clear the LZ for obstacles.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   161  19.5.12.5.  Use  normal  takeoff  performance  unless  max  effort  performance  is  required.  At refusal speed, the copilot calls "Go".  At takeoff speed, the copilot calls "Rotate".  If takeoff and refusal speed are equal, the copilot will call "Go".  (T-2) 19.5.12.6.  At takeoff speed, the pilot will rotate the aircraft to establish a positive climb rate.    The  copilot  checks  the  pitch  attitude  and  will  raise  the  landing  gear  on  the command  of  the  pilot  after  ensuring  a  positive  rate  of  climb.    The  flight  engineer  will back  up  the  pilot  using  NVGs  during  climb  out.    The  copilot  may  take  control  of  the aircraft  if  directed  by  the  pilot  and  continue  the  climb  out  to  the  egress  route  altitude.  The  pilot  flying  directs  the  accomplishment  of  the  appropriate  AFTER  TAKEOFF checklist.  (T-2) 19.5.12.7.  The  left  navigator  will  advise  the  pilots  of  the  initial  on  course  heading  and call altitudes climbing from 100 through 300 ft AGL in 100 foot increments.  (T-2) 19.5.12.8.  As  soon  as  conditions  permit,  the  loadmaster  will  check  equipment  restraint and condition/needs of the onboard user.  (T-2) 19.6.  Tanker/Receiver Air Refueling. 19.6.1.  The pilot in control of the airplane during air refueling operations with the autopilot engaged  will  keep  one  hand  on  the  control  column  and  the  other  hand  available  for immediate  throttle  operation,  in  order  that  prompt  action  can  be  taken  in  the  event  of  an autopilot malfunction.  (T-2) 19.7.  Formation Restrictions. 19.7.1.  Rejoins.  Minimum altitude for rejoin is 500 ft AGL.  (T-2) 19.7.2.  En  Route.

Leaflet airdrops are accomplished in both hostile and permissive environments. 20.2.  Mission  Description.  Mission  requirements  vary  widely  depending  on  the  volume  of leaflets  airdropped,  leaflet  packaging,  and  the  altitude  of  the  airdrop.    Loads  will  normally  not exceed 25,000 pounds.  Drop altitudes may vary from 500 ft AGL to the aircraft service ceiling.  Leaflet  drops  require  the  movement  of  boxes  of  various  weights  from  throughout  the  cargo compartment via intermediate rollers (if required) to the ramp area for dispersal off the ramp.  If specific  mission  requirements  dictate  deviation  from  information  contained  in  this  publication, modify Note:    For  all  airdrops  conducted  above  FL250  comply  with  oxygen  requirements  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3.   Long  duration  high-altitude  drops will require the  aircraft remain  open.    Consider outside air temperature and clothing requirements prior to step.  (T-2) procedures meet to specific requirements.   20.3.  Equipment.  In  addition  to  normal  aircraft  equipment,  the  following  items  may  be required to perform leaflet drops: 20.3.1.  Parachutes  or  restraining  harnesses  must  be  available  for  use  by  all  personnel working in the cargo compartment.  Normally six are required.  (T-2) 20.3.2.  A portable oxygen console will be used IAW AFI 11-409. 20.3.3.  An  interval  timer  is  desirable  (alternating  red  and  green  jump  lights  may  serve  for sequencing the drops). 20.4.  Aircraft  Configuration.  Determine  if  leaflets  are  floor  loaded  (on  aircraft  dual  rail intermediate conveyers) or are configured on pallets.  Based on how the leaflets are prepared and the volume of leaflets to airdrop, there are several possible configurations. 20.4.1.  Palletized Loads.  Preload large volumes of leaflets on pallets and load as palletized cargo.    Resources  permitting,  this  is  the  recommended  procedure  for  large  volumes  of leaflets. 20.4.1.1.  Use modified pallets with warehouse rollers attached to the top of the pallets in two sticks. 20.4.1.2.  Stack  the  leaflet  boxes  on  the  pallets  in  two  sticks  and  secure  them  to  the pallets before loading aircraft. 20.4.1.3.  In addition to the modified pallets, provide a bridge to span the gap between the last floor pallet and the ramp pallet. 20.4.1.3.1.  Construct the bridge so the rollers on it are the same height as the rollers on top of the pallets when loaded on the aircraft dual rails. 20.4.1.3.2.  Install  the  bridge  after  the  ramp  is  lowered  to  the  airdrop  position  and before completion of the slowdown or 3-minute checklist. 20.4.2.  Floor  Loads.    Leaflets  may  also  be  loaded  directly  on  the  aircraft  intermediate conveyors,  if  available.    Employ  this  procedure  for  smaller  loads  of  leaflets  or  when  the equipment mentioned above is not available. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   163  20.4.2.1.  Individual boxes have to be hand loaded and each group of boxes individually secured using aircraft tie-down equipment. 20.4.2.2.  Configure the aircraft IAW the applicable volume and addenda. 20.4.2.2.1.  Recommend  the  intermediate  conveyors  be  moved  inboard  to  the  high-speed configuration (MC-130H), if size of the load permits. 20.4.2.2.2.  If the intermediate conveyors must remain in the outboard configuration, exercise care during loading to ensure the individual boxes contact two intermediate rollers.    The  boxes  may  not  roll  or  may  be  damaged  if  loaded  on  only  one  roller conveyor.  (T-2) 20.4.2.2.2.1.  If  the  intermediate  conveyors  must  remain  in  the  outboard configuration,  consider  using  CDS  skid  boards  or  sheets  of  plywood  as  skids under the leaflet boxes.  (T-2) 20.4.2.2.2.2.  If  using  this  option,  secure  each  skid  of  leaflets  individually  using aircraft tie-down equipment.  (T-2) 20.4.2.2.2.3.  Drift each skid back to the ramp hinge during the airdrop, exercising caution not to let the skid board exit the aircraft.  (T-2) 20.4.2.2.2.4.  Secure  the  empty  skids  against  the  side  wall  until  the  airdrop  is completed.  (T-2) 20.5.  Preparation for Loading.  Complete applicable portions of the appropriate TO 1C-130A-9 checklists as follows:  (T-2) 20.5.1.  Cargo Loading Preparation. 20.5.2.  Cargo Loading (Palletized/Floor Load). 20.5.3.  General Airplane Preparation for Ramp and Door Airdrop/Extraction. 20.5.4.  Anchor Cables.  Rig one anchor cable on each side of the aircraft. 20.5.4.1.  Attach the aft latch of each anchor cable to the inboard U-bolt on the aft anchor cable support on each side of the airplane. 20.5.4.2.  Position the anchor cable stops  to the very forward or  aft end of the cable, or remove and stow the stops, unless they are used as stops for the restraint harness restraint strap. 20.5.4.3.  Attach  the  forward  latch  to  the  center  U-bolts  on  the  forward  anchor  cable support. 20.5.4.3.1.  If the center U-bolts are not accessible because of aircraft configuration, attach the forward latch to the outboard U-bolts. 20.5.4.3.2.  If  connecting  the  forward  latch to  the  outboard  U-bolts, leave  additional slack in the cable to allow anchor cable installation in the outboard location on the A-frame during the airdrop. 20.5.4.3.3.  Lower  the  center  anchor  cable  supports  and  lock  them  in  the  vertical position with the tubular supports.  Do not  connect  the anchor cable to the A-frame   164  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 during  rigging.    The  cable  may  block  the  cargo  door  from  properly  opening  and closing. 20.5.4.3.4.  The aft anchor cable support arm micro switches should be isolated so the cargo ramp will operate with the anchor cables lowered. 20.5.4.3.4.1.  Isolate  the  micro  switches  by  securing  them  back  with  1/4-inch cotton webbing or gutted Type III nylon. 20.5.4.3.4.2.  Test the ramp for operation with the micro switches secured and the anchor cables lowered to ensure the ties were properly installed. 20.5.5.  Static  Line  Retrievers.    Suspend  oxygen  hoses  from  static  line  retriever  cables  for high-altitude missions (not required if airdropping below 10,000 ft MSL). 20.5.5.1.  Unwind static line retriever cable(s). 20.5.5.2.  Install quick disconnects on the aft end of cable(s). 20.5.5.3.  Secure the quick disconnects to the inboard side of the A-frame with two turns of  1/4-inch  cotton  webbing.    Make  this  tie  approximately  18  inches  above  the  anchor cable  attaching  point.    If  the  static  line  retriever  is  inadvertently  rewound,  the  tie  will break and will prevent damage to the A-frame or static line retriever. 20.5.5.4.  Remove all slack from static line retriever cables. 20.5.6.  Oxygen  Hoses  and  Interphone  Cord.    Tape  or  tie  extended  oxygen  hoses  and interphone cords together and suspend from static line retriever cables with G-13 clevises or suitable substitutes. 20.5.6.1.  Ensure that approximately 12 G-13 clevises or suitable substitutes are available to tie oxygen hoses to the static line retriever cable(s). 20.5.6.2.  Recommend the kicker use the oxygen regulator and interphone cord aft of the left paratroop door.  Route the cord and hose up and over the overhead structural beams, and  back  down  next  to  the  overhead  ADS  release.    This  technique  keeps  the  hose  and cord off the floor preventing them from becoming tangled or damaged.   It also keeps it out of the kicker's way while kicking boxes and retrieving static lines. 20.6.  Securing Boxes.  Secure five boxes on the ramp for airdrop.  If loading preloaded pallets, two sticks of five boxes each, are secured on the ramp pallet.  (T-2) 20.7.  Connecting Static Lines.  Connect static lines to the anchor cable aft of the A-frame.  (T-2) 20.8.  Restraint  Strapping.  Place a single length of Type III nylon, as final restraint, over the stick of boxes.  The cargo restraint strap over the boxes on the ramp is removed at the 1-minute warning.  The Type III nylon final restraint is cut at the release point.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   165  Figure 20.1.  Leaflet Box Rigging Procedures. 20.9.  Leaflet  Box  Rigging  Procedures.  Rigging  boxes dissemination.  (T-2) for  high-altitude  static line  20.9.1.  Using a punch, cut four holes approximately 2 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches as indicated in Figure  20.1.  If a punch is not available, a knife can be used.  When using a punch, the box  must  first  be  placed  upon  an  object  slightly  deeper  and  smaller  than  the  box  so  that  a hard-surface is provided when striking the punch. 20.9.2.  Cut through the box from one hole to another as illustrated in Figure 20.1. 20.9.3.  Place  a  2-inch  wide  length  of  webbing  through  the  holes.    The  length  of  webbing depends upon the size of the box, but must be long enough to tie after the box has been filled with leaflets. 20.9.4.  Place a 3- or 4-inch strip of masking tape over the 2-inch wide webbing. 20.9.5.  Cut all four corners of the box from the top to about three-fourths of the way down (or less). 20.9.6.  Again  using  masking  tape,  tape  one  strip  up  the  cut  portion  and  two  across,  as illustrated. 20.9.7.  After filling the box with leaflets, tie the two strips of webbing. 20.9.8.  Attach  one  end  of  the  static  line  to  the  webbing  ties.    The  length  of  the  static  line depends upon the type of aircraft, but it is normally about 15 ft long.  The box is rolled out of   166  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 the aircraft and as the container comes to the end of the static line, the sides of the box split.  In effect, it is turned inside out.  The leaflets fall away followed by the empty box. 20.9.9.  This  is  one  method,  and  may  not  be  the  method  suited  for  your  mission.    Other variations do exist; however, this is the most universal and least complex. 20.10.  Preparation  for  Airdrop.  After  takeoff,  take  the  following  actions  before  starting  the leaflet airdrop checklist.  (T-2) 20.10.1.  Tape all ramp control panel switches, except the auxiliary pump and ramp switch. 20.10.2.  Lower  anchor  cables  and  connect  them  to  the  outboard  side  of  the  anchor  cable supports. 20.10.3.  Safety tie the aft anchor cable support micro switches. 20.10.4.  Position/don emergency equipment and survival gear. 20.10.5.  Begin Leaflet Airdrop checklist. 20.11.  Aircrew  Procedures.  Under  normal  circumstances  the  crew  required  for  leaflet operations  consists  of  a  tactical  crew  plus  two  aerospace  PTs  (for  high-altitude  airdrops)  and three  additional  crew  members  to  act  as  feeders.    The  senior  loadmaster  will  assign  specific positions for activity in the cargo compartment.  (T-2) 20.11.1.  Drop  Configuration/Maneuvering.    Base  configuration  on  desired  coverage  and airframe airspeed limitations.  All personnel should be constantly aware of the possibility of an emergency break upon encountering a threat. the drop the unless 20.11.1.1.  Flaps.  Flaps are normally set at 50% and flap settings should not be changed during Note:  At very high-altitudes, the aircraft may not be able to maintain drop airspeed with 50%  flaps.    Under  these  conditions,  use  an  intermediate  flap  setting  that  allows  for aircraft  performance  and  also  produces  an  acceptable  deck  angle  for  the  drop.    A  flap setting  near  20%  gives  the  best  aircraft  wing  performance  while  providing  high  rudder boost for controllability. loadmaster is notified.   20.11.1.2.  Airspeed.  Base KIAS/KCAS on desired groundspeed.  This may range from 125 to 150 KIAS (MC-130P) or 125 to 250 KCAS (MC-130H).  Other speed ranges may apply if not dropping off the ramp (i.e., cargo door only). 20.12.  Static Lines.  To increase speed of closing the ramp if a hostile threat is detected and to prevent damage to the aircraft, the static lines should be stowed after each box goes out.  Do this if the interval between boxes permits safe operation.  Static lines may be cut in an emergency. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   167  Chapter 21 SEARCH AND RESCUE PROCEDURES 21.1.  General.  Most searches are part of an effort to save life; therefore, make every effort to complete  the  search  as  rapidly  and  efficiently  as  possible.    A  thorough  scan  of  the  search  area and accurate navigation significantly increase the probability of detection.  Reactions to sightings must  be  timely  and  accurate.    This  section  outlines  operational  procedures  for  conducting effective  searches  in  the  C-130  aircraft.    Refer  to  the  International  Aeronautical  and  Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Volumes I/II for additional information.  (T-2) Table 21.1.  Search and Rescue Frequencies.

Search  and  Rescue  Satellite-Aided  Tracking  (SARSAT).  SARSAT  is  an international satellite system for SAR.  It consists of a constellation of seven satellites in low earth orbit, 5 geostationary satellites and a network of earth stations, which provide distress alert  and  location  information  to  appropriate  rescue  authorities  anywhere  in  the  world  for users in distress.  The SARSAT satellites detect beacons broadcasting on 406.025 Megahertz (MHz).    The  current  SARSAT  system  consists  of  64  Local  User  Terminals  (LUT)  and  26 Mission  Control  Centers  in  32  countries,  including  12  in  the  United  States.    SARSAT coverage on 406.025 MHz is worldwide.  The Rescue Coordination Center (RCC) at Langley Air  Force  Base  (AFB),  VA,  maintains  a  deployable  LUT  capability  (camper  sized,  air transportable vans) to provide contingency coverage. 21.2.  Search  Altitude.  Select  an  optimum  search  altitude  based  upon  the  object  of  search, weather in the search area, electronic or visual location aids used, and any other known factor, which  would  affect  the  search  altitude.    Generally,  the  lower  the  search  altitude,  the  better  the chance  of  seeing  an  object,  provided  the  altitude  is  not  so  low  that  the  aircraft  speed  becomes detrimental.  During preliminary searches, the altitude will be higher to detect possible signals at greater distances.  Also, see Table 21.7. 21.3.  Search Procedures.   170  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 21.3.1.  Rescue  missions  often  involve  commitment  based  upon  calculated  risks.    Give  full consideration to all safety factors.  Timely reaction to all search missions is essential to the safety  of  personnel  or  equipment.    Do  not  jeopardize  safety  by  inadequate  preparation  or short cuts to expedite takeoff, or arrival at search areas.  Aircrews will comply with all other applicable directives, which govern their duties, such as:  (T-2) 21.3.1.1.  Accomplish  complete  predeparture  flight  planning  except  for  scramble missions.  On scramble missions, complete essential flight planning prior to and shortly after takeoff. 21.3.1.2.  Use inflight procedures in accordance with the appropriate theater of operation flight regulations. 21.3.1.2.1.  Aircraft  will  maintain  vertical  and  horizontal  separation  in  the  search area.  This is critical when several aircraft are searching within close proximity. Table 21.7.

Continually  cross-check  headings,  drift,  time,  airspeed,  and  altitude  to maintain the best possible search coverage.   172  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 21.3.2.7.4.  Use  a  large-scale  chart  when  searching  over  land  to  ensure  terrain  and obstacle clearance.  Use a search pattern graph as a suitable reference while searching over water. 21.3.2.7.5.  Record sighting information on log and plot position on navigation chart. 21.3.2.7.6.  Monitor equipment during radar and electronic searches. 21.3.2.7.7.  Debrief  controlling  agency  with  an  accurate  depiction  of  any  areas searched. 21.3.2.7.8.  When  other  aircraft  are  involved,  with  the  assistance  of  the  nav/EWO, track and assign search areas for other aircraft. 21.3.2.8.  The  PIC  will  direct  a  crew  member  to  maintain  radio  communications  with other search aircraft and the controlling agency as required. 21.3.2.9.  The  loadmaster  will  assume  supervision  of  the  scanners  and  will  schedule rotation and rest periods.  Scanners should be rotated every 30 to 45 minutes of scanning and rested after two hours, if enough scanners are available. 21.3.2.10.  All crew members will assist with the scanning duties when possible. 21.3.2.11.  When a search is completed with negative results, consider searching the area again.  Normally, position subsequent search legs between or 45° to the previous search legs.  This procedure, in effect, results in smaller track spacing. 21.3.3.  In the search area:  (T-2) 21.3.3.1.  Descend to search altitude, see Table 21.7. 21.3.3.2.  Have  navigator  obtain  the  wind  at  search  altitude.    To  visually  cover  the area thoroughly,  slow  the  airspeed  during  search  patterns  (refer  to  the  Aircraft  Performance Manual). 21.3.3.3.  Notify ATC of arrival on scene and estimated endurance. 21.3.3.4.  Vector other aircraft to the scene. 21.3.3.5.  Use radar (some life rafts carry reflectors). 21.3.3.6.  Assume  on-scene  command  until  relieved  by  another  duly  appointed  SAR aircraft.  As other aircraft arrive, do the following: 21.3.3.6.1.  Establish contact on channels other than Guard. 21.3.3.6.2.  Obtain aircraft type identification, endurance, and rescue capability. 21.3.3.6.3.  Assign  altimeter  setting,  frequencies,  search  areas,  patterns,  and  altitude separation. 21.3.3.7.  If leaving the search area because of lack of fuel, assign another aircraft as on-scene commander. 21.3.4.  Determine an accurate wind prior to and throughout the search by INS.  Use Table 21.9 to estimate wind velocity near the surface.  (T-2) AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   173  21.3.5.  When  flying  search  patterns,  turns  must  be  accurate  and  uniform  as  possible.    The following procedures are provided to assist the aircrew in making precise turns:  (T-2) 21.3.5.1.  Fly the aircraft on autopilot when possible. 21.3.5.2.  Prior  to  starting  the  pattern,  the  navigator  will  brief  the  crew  on  the  direction and rate of turn and the turn command procedure used. 21.3.5.3.  Normally, all turns are standard rate (3° per second) unless track spacing is less in  distance  than  the  diameter  of  a  standard  turn  at  a  given  speed.    In  this  situation, continue turn to 180° and adjust turn rate as required to remain within the pattern. Table 21.8.  Sector Search Pattern Computation.

If survivors are in life jackets, make attempts as soon as possible to furnish them with life rafts or other survival equipment and signaling devices. 21.3.5.5.  Direct  potential  rescue  or  recovery  vessels  and  other  aircraft  to  the  scene  by radio  or  visual  signals.    Radio  and  visual  signals  you  may  use  to  direct  a  vessel  to  the scene to include: 21.3.5.5.1.  Radio message to the vessel. 21.3.5.5.2.  Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) to take bearings on a vessel's LF or MF transmissions. 21.3.5.5.3.  VHF  or  UHF  direction  finder  to  take  bearings  of  VHF  or  UHF transmissions. 21.3.5.5.4.  Radar and IFF. 21.3.5.5.5.  Signal light. 21.3.5.5.6.  Dropping message containers. 21.3.5.5.7.  Pyrotechnic flares. 21.3.5.6.  When radio communications are not possible, establish self-identification, then indicate location of the target by:  (T-2) 21.3.5.6.1.  Circling the vessel at least once at low altitude. 21.3.5.6.2.  Flying across the bow of the vessel at least once, and rocking wings at the same time. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   175  21.3.5.6.3.  Sending a message by signal light or dropping a message, if possible. 21.3.5.6.4.  Heading  in  the  direction  of  the  target.    Repeat  this  procedure  until  the vessel acknowledges by following the aircraft, or indicates that it is unable to comply by hoisting the International Flag, November (the International Flag, November, is a blue and white checkerboard).  Crossing the wake of the vessel close astern at a low altitude  means  that  the  service  of  the  vessel  to  which  the  signal  is  directed  is  no longer required. 21.3.5.7.  In daytime, use any of the following means to inform survivors they have been sighted:  (T-2) 21.3.5.7.1.  Fly low over survivors with landing lights on. 21.3.5.7.2.  Blink a signal light in the direction of survivors. 21.3.5.7.3.  Drop two marker signals a few seconds apart. 21.3.5.8.  Aircrews sighting survivors at night should: 21.3.5.8.1.  Mark  the  position  by  dropping  marker  smoke  or  strobe  lights  with floatation collars. 21.3.5.8.2.  Request assistance from other search aircraft or ships. 21.3.5.8.2.1.  If a rescue vessel arrives in the area, direct it to the scene by giving the target position in relation to the float light.  Drop parachute flares to assist the rescue or recovery vessel in sighting the target.  (T-2) 21.3.5.8.2.2.  If  the  objective  has  not  been  located,  but  its  position  is  fairly  well established, drop two strobe lights or datum marker buoys to outline the limits of the  search  area,  the  most  probable  position  of  target  being  halfway  between  the lights.  Start the search from one light to the other, dropping parachute flares for illumination.  (T-2) 21.3.5.8.2.3.  If no surface vessel is available, but two aircraft are on-scene, have one aircraft fly over the area  at 3,000 ft dropping flares at 2 or  3-mile  intervals.  Station the other aircraft 3 miles behind the illuminating aircraft, slightly upwind at 500 ft to search.  (T-2) 21.4.  Departing Search Area. 21.4.1.  Notify  ATC  and  the  appropriate  SAR  agency  on-scene  SAR  aircraft,  Rescue Coordination Center, etc.  (T-2) 21.4.2.  If  other  search  aircraft  have  not  arrived,  reconfirm  position,  and  advise  survivors when further assistance will arrive, if known.  (T-2) 21.5.  Rescue  Airdrops.  Rescue  airdrops  of  rescue  equipment  allow  rapid  deployment  of  Sea Rescue  Kits,  pyrotechnics,  emergency  equipment,  etc.,  in  an  unplanned  and  rapidly  changing environment.    An  example  would  be  dropping  a  Sea  Rescue  Kit  to  a  helicopter  that  ditched during  helicopter  air  refueling.    Specific  patterns  are  Sea  Rescue  Kit  deployments  and Parabundle and Free-fall equipment drops. 21.5.1.  The pilot will always brief the pattern and delivery to be flown.  (T-2)   176  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 21.5.1.1.  At  a  minimum,  brief  the  type  of  equipment  to  be  delivered,  delivery  method (pattern shape, relationship to wind, etc.), altitudes, airspeeds, commands to be used, and required actions for malfunctions.  (T-2) 21.5.2.  Sea  Rescue  Kit  Deployment.    The  Sea  Rescue  Kit  is  designed  to  meet  conditions, which require aerial delivery of emergency floatation and survival gear.  The kit is dropped free-fall  and  abeam  during  a  crosswind  pass  over  the  target.    When  correctly  dropped,  a straight line is formed on the water with an inflated raft at each end.  After delivery, the two rafts  with  their  high  freeboard  will  begin  to  drift  downwind  until  retarded  by  the  partially submerged supply containers.  Thus, when the kit is properly deployed, wind conditions will cause the kit to form a "U”, partially encircling the target. 21.5.2.1.  Surface wind will affect the kit and target in varying amounts in proportion to the  area  exposed  above  the  water  and  displacement  below  the  water.    The  kit  will  drift faster  than  nearly  all-seagoing  vessels  (outboards,  cabin  cruisers,  trawlers,  heavy displacement deep draft vessels and 1 man life rafts) but slower than a 6-, 7-, or 20-man raft.  If a kit drifts faster, it will be delivered upwind.  If the target drifts faster, the kit will be delivered downwind.  When the surface wind is less than 15 knots, the delivery pass will be offset approximately 50 ft.  Distance will be increased 25 ft for each 10 knots in excess Exception:    Downwind  kit  drops  will  always  be  offset  approximately  50  ft.    Do  not correct for wind.  (T-2) 15-knot base.   of the 21.5.2.2.  When deploying a Sea Rescue Kit in high winds the kit may be deployed with the rafts deflated to improve drop accuracy.  See Paragraph  21.11.2 for special rigging instructions. 21.5.2.3.  Pyrotechnics  may  be  useful  in  determining  wind  strength  and  direction,  and maintaining pattern orientation. 21.5.2.4.  Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern Procedures (Figure 21.2). 21.5.2.4.1.  Maneuver  the  aircraft  onto  a  flight  path  that  is  crosswind  and approximately  50  ft  from  the  target  on  the  side  opposite  to  that  of  the  intended  kit delivery.  Maintain drop altitude and airspeed. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   177  Figure 21.2.  Standard Sea Rescue Kit Pattern.  21.5.2.4.2.  When abeam the target, begin the count (use seconds).  Two seconds past the  target,  release  a  smoke  marker  (if  available).    The  pilot  will  count  over interphone, "One Thousand One, One Thousand Drop".  On the command of "Drop" the  copilot  or  flight  engineer  will  activate  the  appropriate  flare  launching  switch  on the  copilot's  flare  launcher  control  panel  or  the  loadmaster  will  manually  launch  a smoke marker.  (T-2) 21.5.2.4.3.  Maintain  heading  for  10  seconds  and  drop  second  timing  signal  (if available).  Turn 45° to the right and hold that heading for 15 seconds.  Make a 180° left-hand standard rate turn.  Adjust turn to final so as to pass upwind or downwind of the target (as required for the delivery).  Distance will vary with the type of target and wind velocity.  Rolling out, the pilot will notify the crew:  "30 Seconds To Target".  (T-2)   178  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 21.5.2.4.4.  Approximately  10  seconds  from  the  smoke  marker,  the  pilot  will  notify crew:  "10 Seconds".  Just prior to abeam the smoke marker, the pilot will command "Ready", and then abeam the marker, "Drop".  Note:  Aircraft without marker signals should fly the pattern as described and attempt to drop the kit 4 seconds prior to the target.  (T-2) 21.5.2.5.  Navigator Assistance for Sea Rescue Kits.  The navigator can assist the pilot by the  use  of  onboard  systems.    The  navigator  will  advise  the  pilot  when  the  aircraft approaches the final delivery track.  (T-2) 21.5.2.5.1.  The  navigator  should  set  up  the  onboard  navigation  system  as  follows (SCNS-equipped aircraft):  (T-2) 21.5.2.5.1.1.  During  the  flight  plan  programming  portion  of  the  preflight,  the navigator  should  load  two  dummy  waypoints  that  will  later  serve  as  the  IP  and target.  (The target will be the location of the survivor or position to which the kit will Note:    This  step  will  save  time  inflight  by  eliminating  the  need  to  modify  the flight plan sequence. delivered).   be 21.5.2.5.1.2.  As the aircraft flies over the target on the initial pass, the navigator will mark this position and store it.  The wind (e.g., 180/015) should be noted and recorded at this time.  The onboard system will allow the navigator to direct the pilot perpendicular to the wind on the final run-in to the target. 21.5.2.5.1.3.  Go to the plan page.  Call up the dummy waypoint that was initially designated the target and redesignate it as the mark point (stored target position).  Verify this waypoint. 21.5.2.5.1.4.  Go to the preceding waypoint and redesignate it as the mark point. 21.5.2.5.1.5.  Define  an  initial  point  (IP)  using  a  range  and  bearing  from  the original mark point and save it as the waypoint prior to the target.  Use a bearing that  is  the reciprocal  of  the  desired  run-in  heading  (e.g.,  090/270  degrees)  and  a range of 5 to 10 nm and verify.  The pilot must confirm the final run-in heading before Note:  Keep in mind that the target will drift.  This is basically a visual maneuver; the  navigation  systems  are  used  as  a  backup.    The  pilot  should  make  every attempt to keep the target in sight. navigator load can the the bearing.   21.5.2.5.1.6.  The pilot will use the system to help maintain situational awareness and  line  up  on  the  target  for  the  delivery  pass.    During  the  run-in,  the  pilot  will offset upwind or downwind as necessary (see Paragraph 21.10.2.1). 21.5.3.  Parabundle and Free-fall Deployment:  (T-2) 21.5.3.1.  When practical, use a racetrack pattern with the drop heading into the wind for equipment  drops.    However,  circumstances  may  dictate  a  modified  pattern.    Equipment may  be  dropped  from  the  paratroop  doors  or  the  aft  cargo  door  and  ramp.    The  first bundle dropped is, in effect, a spotter bundle.  Therefore, it should be the least critical to the  survivors.   Water  deliveries  must  consider  wind,  drift,  and  sea  state.   AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   179  WARNING:  The delivery  of equipment, no  matter how vital,  must  never endanger  the lives of the receivers. 21.5.3.2.  Equipment deliveries to land drop zones should be planned to impact within 50 yards of the target.  Water deliveries should be planned to impact within  5 yards of the target  or  within  a  45°  sector  centered  on  the  drift  line  for  100  yards.    In  any  case, deliveries should never be in excess of 5 yards up-drift of the target. 21.5.3.3.  Pilot  Procedures.    Pilots  are  responsible  for  determining  the  mode  of deployment,  drop  location,  and  type  pattern  to  be  flown.    They  must  ensure  the loadmaster is aware of the desired PI.  When the situation permits, the pilot will make an observation pass over the drop zone.  Final free-fall altitude will be no lower than 150 ft AGL.  Final parabundle altitude should be no lower than 300 ft AGL.  Minimum altitude for WARNING:  Keep turns below 300 ft AGL to a minimum. airdrops night 500 all is ft AGL.   21.5.3.3.1.  Aircraft  altitude,  attitude,  course,  and  airspeed  should  be  established  by 30 seconds to  target and no later  than 10 seconds to  target.  The pilot  will keep  the crew apprised of their position in the pattern.  At a minimum, on final the pilot will state  "30  Seconds  To  Target",  then  "10  Seconds".    Once  the  loadmaster  spots  the target, he will state, "Target In Sight" and provide the pilot with course corrections if time permits. 21.5.3.4.  Loadmaster  Procedures.    Loadmasters  must  understand  the  location  of  the desired PI.  When looking for the target, the loadmaster will use either paratroop door.  If the PI is difficult to spot, ask the pilot to give a countdown to the PI on the run in.  (T-2) 21.5.3.4.1.  The loadmaster will hook up the restraint system as described in Chapter 6.    The  jump  platform  will  be  extended  and  the  air  deflector  doors  opened.    The loadmaster  may  align  the  aircraft  for  the  airdrop  by  sighting  down  the  edge  of  the jump  platform  to  the  drop  zone  and  steering  the  aircraft  with  standard  calls  of “Steady”,  “Right,  (number  of)  Degrees”,  or  “Left,  (number  of)  Degrees”.   Note:  If the loadmaster places their head on the jump platform to sight and align the aircraft,  they  should  place  their  head  toward  the  forward  edge  for  parabundle airdrops, and move their head aft for free-fall airdrops and to compensate for higher altitudes.  (T-2) 21.5.3.4.2.  Bundle  dimensions  for  paratroop  door  drops,  including  the  parachute, must not exceed 48 by 30 by 66 inches.  Bundles in excess of 100 pounds require a second  pusher  and  those  between  350-500  pounds  require  two  additional  pushers.  For equipment to be delivered from the paratroop door, attach the static line (if used) to tie-down ring 26-B or 26-F.  Secure equipment until it is ready for delivery.  (T-2) 21.5.3.4.3.  If equipment cannot be delivered from the paratroop door, the loadmaster may  prepare  and  position  the  equipment  on  the  ramp  for  delivery,  and  use  another thoroughly  briefed  crew  member  to  release  the  equipment.    The  equipment  will  be secured until ready for delivery.  For equipment to be delivered from the ramp, attach the static line (if used) to a tie-down ring in row 30.  The crew member assisting the loadmaster will connect to the same restraint cable as the loadmaster with the shuttle aft support. anchor center cable the of  (T-2)       180  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 WARNING:  The shuttle will not be moved aft until after the ramp is lowered.  (T-2)   WARNING:  The shuttle must be moved forward of the center anchor cable support before raising the ramp to close.  (T-2) 21.5.3.4.4.  The loadmaster will normally spot the target 8 seconds prior to the release point, and give the preparatory  command "Ready"  and the deployment command of "Drop".  After each delivery, the loadmaster will report status of drop (load clear or status) and impact point whenever possible.  (T-2) 21.5.3.5.  Equipment  Delivery  in  Forested  Areas.    Due  to  the  possibility  of  equipment hang-up  in  trees,  consideration  should  be  given  to  attaching  drop  lines  to  equipment intended to be delivered by parachute.  The drop line needs to be long enough to allow the chute to hang up in treetops, and still permit ground forces to recover the equipment.  In addition to the drop lines now in use by units (local design and manufacture), consider the possibility of using equipment already maintained on the aircraft, such as Sea Rescue Kit  buoyant  rope  (210  ft  long).    Drop  lines  will  be  secured  to  the  parachute  riser snaps/connectors  and  equipment  package  "D/V  rings"  with  carabineers  or  equivalent.  The  drop  line  will  be  assembled  into  accordion  "S"  folds,  secured  with  retainer  bands, and  attached  to  the  equipment  package.    Note:    Final  approach  altitude  should  be adjusted to compensate for tree height, but never less than 150 ft above the treetops.  (T-2) 21.5.3.6.  Pattern  for  Night  Aerial  Delivery.    NVGs  may  be  used  for  night  operations.  Aircrews will accomplish the appropriate low-level checklist to configure the aircraft for NVG operations.  (T-2) 21.5.3.7.  Night  Delivery.    Equipment  to  be  delivered  at  night  will  have  marker  lights attached.    For  water  drops,  attach  the  light  by  securing  a  double  5  ft  length  of  type  III nylon (550/cord) to the marker light, then attach the other end to the equipment.  Stabilize the light to the equipment with type number 5 cord.  Pass the parachute static line under the  type  number  5  cord  to  ensure  light  breakaway  when  deployed.    For  land  drops, chemical  lights  are  recommended.    Attach  chemical  lights  securely  to  prevent detachment.  (T-2) 21.6.  Sea Rescue Kits. 21.6.1.  The Sea Rescue Kit consists of five bundles: 21.6.1.1.  The  two  end  bundles  (1  and  5)  contain  either  a  six,  seven  or  20  man  raft.  Bundles 2 and 4 contain emergency radios and bundle 3 contains medical gear. 21.6.1.2.  The  total  weight  of  all  five  bundles  is  232  pounds  for  a  MA-1  kit  and  311 pounds for a MA-2 kit. 21.6.1.3.  Each bundle is connected by 210 ft of buoyant rope. 21.6.1.4.  The kit is deployed manually off the cargo ramp. 21.6.2.  Rigging Sequence.  (T-2) 21.6.2.1.  Rigging sequence will be as shown in Figure 21.3. 21.6.2.2.  During inflight rigging, the cargo ramp and door will remain closed.  Attach a tie-down strap across the kit to prevent movement. AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   181  21.6.2.3.  Unsnap the inflation lanyard protection flap of container #1 (raft), marked 1 of 5  and  leave  open.

Hazards.    In  general,  pyrotechnics  contain  materials  of  a  hazardous  nature.    Even though each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within itself, it may react with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an even greater hazard.  Pyrotechnics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition because  they  are  more  easily  activated.    These  items  should  not  be  handled  roughly  or exposed to moisture.  When subjected to fire, most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat. 21.7.2.1.  Toxic Hazards.  Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if taken  internally.    This  also  applies  to  the  residues  of  burned  pyrotechnics.    From  an inhalation standpoint, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a serious problem.  Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are considered nontoxic, heavy concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and may be lethal, for they reduce the amount of available oxygen in the air. 21.7.3.  Handling.  Besides the hazardous basic compositions, pyrotechnics contain sensitive elements such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers.  Pyrotechnics should be handled with  care  and  protected  against  moisture,  shock,  friction,  or  heat.    Care  should  be  taken  to avoid  premature  ignition  or  damage  that  may  cause  failure  when  fired.    Boxes  containing pyrotechnics  should  not  be  dropped  or  thrown.    Protective  or  safety  devices  should  not  be removed until just before use.  Care should be taken to avoid damage to fiber cases and rip cords  located  outside  the  casing  of  flares.    Pyrotechnics  should  be  handled  so  as  to  avoid denting or deforming the barrel or case.  Do not use pyrotechnics that are dented, deformed, cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, loped closing, or have shipping covers with an  illegible  lot  number,  manufacture  date,  or  other  required  identifying  information.  Pyrotechnics  will  be  handled  only  under  the  supervision  of  a  competent,  qualified  person.  Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be adequately prepared to handle an emergency situation (e.g., heat resistant gloves and broom).  (T-2) 21.7.4.  Storage.  Units that have a requirement for storing pyrotechnics will obtain a license from the host base.  (T-3) 21.7.5.  Issue  Procedures.    Pyrotechnics  that  have  been  issued  for  training  purposes  will  be marked in bold capital letters with the word TRAINING.  These pyrotechnics will always be stored separately from operational stock within storage areas.  (T-2) 21.7.6.  Safety.    All  of  the  pyrotechnics  described  contain  combustible  chemicals  which, when  ignited,  generate  a  flame  or  smoke  (or  combination  of  both)  for  a  broad  variety  of purposes.    These  purposes  include  visual  signaling,  area  or  target  illumination,  and  point marking.  Most are intended to burn with intense heat. 21.7.6.1.  Initiation  Mechanism.    Pyrotechnic  devices  normally  are  equipped  with  some type of safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation mechanism.    Any  pyrotechnic  which  shows  sign  of  damage  to  safety  features  is considered  unserviceable  and  must  be  carefully  segregated  for  prompt  disposition  by explosives ordinance disposal (EOD).  (T-2). 21.7.6.2.  Accidental Initiation.  If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited, in all  cases  its  functioning  will  result  in  a  fire  hazard.    The  gases  generated  by  this AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   185  combustion could present a serious toxic hazard.  Signaling devices containing propellant charges create an extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited. 21.7.6.3.  Fighting  Pyrotechnic  Fires.   Pyrotechnic  compositions  characteristically contain  their  own  oxidants,  and  therefore  do  not  depend  upon  atmospheric  oxygen  for combustion.  For this reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective.  Many  pyrotechnic  mixtures,  particularly  illuminating  flare  compositions,  burn  with intense heat up to 4,500° F.  Normally, available extinguishers are of little or no value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may produce toxic or poisonous gases. 21.7.6.4.  Safe Altitudes and Distances.  Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when they land may ignite combustible material.  Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the burning  time,  rate  of  descent,  and  drift  of  the  flare.    Such  factors  will  be  considered  in determining minimum altitudes and distances of release.  Signal flares are also a potential fire  hazard  when CAUTION:  Flares will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emergency.    If  such  an  emergency  exists,  flares  should  be  dropped  from  sufficient altitude to allow complete burnout before hitting the surface.  (T-2) the  parachute support fails to the signal  properly.   21.7.6.5.  Reporting  Instructions.    Prepare  instructions  for  mishaps,  accidents,  and incidents  in  accordance  with  AFI  91-204.    Prepare  unsatisfactory  reports  in  accordance with TO 00-35D-54, USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation, and Resolution. 21.7.7.  Pyrotechnics Launching:  (T-2) 21.7.7.1.  Personnel  launching  pyrotechnics  through  open  doors  or  hatches  will  wear  a restraint harness or parachute, and will have aramid or heat resistant gloves and a broom or  wood stick readily available in case of fire.   Wearing  nomex gloves when deploying pyrotechnics  is  recommended.    When  manually  launching  parachute  flares  from  the aircraft, only the cargo ramp will be opened unless the mission dictates otherwise.  (This is to assist in eliminating pyrotechnics missile hazard). 21.7.7.2.  The  aircraft  will  be  prepared  for  flare  jettison  prior  to  handling  any pyrotechnic.    Only  the  cargo  ramp  will  be  opened  unless  mission  requirements  dictate otherwise.    All  parachute  flares  hand-launched  from  the  ramp  will  use  a  10  ft  lanyard (Refer  to  Figure  21.5).    The  flare  will  be  hand-launched  upon  command  of  the  PIC  or designated CAUTION:    Personnel  launching  flares  will  ensure  the  lanyard  system  is  clear  of extremities and equipment before launching.  Excess lanyard should be accordion folded and held against the body of the flare or taped with paper tape. crew member.   21.7.8.  Pyrotechnics Description and Operation:  (T-2) 21.7.8.1.  LUU-2/B, 2A/B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute: 21.7.8.1.1.  Description.  The LUU-2/B, 2A/B is an air-launched parachute flare.  It is 36  inches  long,  4.875  inches  in  diameter  and  rated  as  providing  2-million candlepower illumination for approximately 300 seconds (5 minutes).  Some uses are illumination of areas for crash landing, ditching, landing, target, dropping of supplies, hovering of rescue aircraft, etc.   186  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 21.7.8.1.2.  Operation.    Remove  the  flare  from  the  shipping  container  and  set  the desired ft of fall in the flare timer end cap.  A setting of 500 ft represents a time delay of 6.3 seconds.  A launch altitude of 3,000 ft AGL is recommended and will provide a light at 2,500 ft AGL.  The flare descends approximately 2,500 ft during burning and will burn out and dump at ground level.  The snap hook in the lanyard package of the flare  shipping  container  may  be  used  for  the  flare  attaching  end.    The  10  ft  lanyard secured to a tie-down ring near the aft end of the ramp will be attached to the lanyard or to the timer dial knob.  Upon launch signal, toss the flare overboard from the rear of the ramp, or floor jettison port with ignition end out first (ignition end is opposite from the timer end cap).  A force of 30 to 35 pounds is required to extract the timer dial knob and drogue cover strip.  The knob and cover strip will remain with the static line.    Retrieve  the  static  line  and  remove  the  timer  dial  knob  from  the  snap  hook.  Stow the timer dial knob until mission is over; then dispose of all residue. 21.7.8.2.  LUU-4B; Flare, Aircraft Parachute: 21.7.8.2.1.  Description.  The LUU-4/B is an air-launched parachute flare.  It is 25.5 inches long, 4.875 inches in diameter, and rated as providing 1.6-million candlepower illumination  for  approximately  180  seconds  (3  minutes).    Uses  are  the  same  as  the LUU-2/B, 2A/B. 21.7.8.2.2.  Operation.  The flare altitude should be planned so as that burnout occurs approximately 300 ft AGL over water and higher over land.  Recommend maximum deployment  airspeed  of  200  KIAS/KCAS  due  to  possible  failure  of  the  parachute system.  Manual launch procedures are the same as LUU-2/B procedures. 21.7.8.3.  LUU-2/B, LUU-2A/B, LUU-4/B Emergency Procedures: - Cut; 21.7.8.3.1.  Premature  timer  release/ignition  in  aircraft  or  storage  container:    Nylon cord WARNING:  In the event the timer end cap is separated from the flare, do not pull on the  nylon  cord  or  the  parachute.    An  approximate  50-pound  pull  on  one  of  the suspension cables of the parachute will cause the flare to ignite.  Return the flare to the shipping container and turn flare over to EOD at mission completion. Container Taped; Pilot - - Notified.   21.7.8.3.2.  Pre-ignition  of  Flare:    Jettison  flare  or  container  immediately;  Pilot  - notified.   WARNING:    In  the  event  of  flare  ignition,  an  attempt  will  be  made  to  jettison  the flare.    In  event  of  candle  ignition,  intense  light,  heat,  and  lethal  gas  will  be experienced.  Adequate respiratory, eye, and hand protection will be sought as soon as emergency permits.  Flare suppression will be attempted as a last resort. 21.7.8.3.3.  Flare  breakaway  fails  to  release:    Static  line  -  Cut;  Pilot  -  Notified.  WARNING:    Packaged  aircraft  parachute  flares  dropped  in  excess  of  3  ft  or unpackaged flares dropped in excess of 1 ft shall be considered unserviceable. 21.7.8.4.

Crew Notified Checked On “Indicates (LM)  (LM)   296  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015 Conscious/Unconscious” or “Parachutists Released”  NOTE: The jumpmaster/safety will determine how the parachutist is entangled.  If being towed by anything other than the static line, the jumpmaster will attempt to free the parachutist.  If being towed by the static line, the jumpmaster/ safety will recommend whether to retrieve or cut free.  If all parachutists have exited and no safety is on board, this responsibility rests with the loadmaster. NOTE: The parachutist will indicate consciousness and that a reserve parachute is ready by maintaining a tight body position with both hands on the reserve.     5.  Static Line Cut on Command NOTE: It will be necessary to partially rewind the retriever cable to reach the static line for cutting. WARNING: First priority is to cut the parachutist free if the parachutist indicated consciousness.  If the parachutist is unconscious, does not signal, cannot be observed, or a condition exists that prevents cutting the static line, implement emergency retrieval procedures. NOTE:                AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   297  If the decision is to retrieve follow the procedures below.  a.  5,000 lb Strap Installed NOTE: To retrieve a parachutist over the aircraft ramp, the loadmaster will install a 5,000 lb strap to the emergency retrieval rings or HSLLADS rings located at approximately FS 848.  Attach the hook end of the strap on the ring closest to the static line with the hook facing forward on the emergency retrieval rings/down on the HSLLADS rings and attach the ratchet end on the other side.  Using the static line retriever, the static lines will be retrieved over the strap and the parachutist will be brought in by hand.              b.  Static lines Retrieve static line(s) over the 5,000 lb strap     WARNING: During retrieval attempts ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time.  This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary. WARNING: The last 5 ft are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist.  A wildly oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp headfirst.  If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, then continue with the retrieval.            298  AFI11-2MC-130V3  28 MAY 2015   NOTE: Once the parachutist is pulled up into the ramp and is being controlled, slightly unwind the retriever cable so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.  6.
