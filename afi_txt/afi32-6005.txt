The professionals and individuals who comprise a specific CMT will vary based on the needs of the individual and their family (e.g., health care provider(s), nurse case manager, therapist, social worker, chain-of-command representative, transition coordinator, and all others providing care, benefits, and services), but at minimum, will consist of a medical case manager and a non-medical case manager.  Recovering Service Member (RSM) - A member of the military services who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy and is in an inpatient or outpatient status, who incurred or aggravated a serious illness or injury in the line of duty, and who may be assigned to a temporary disability retired or permanent disability retired list due to the Military Department’s disability evaluation system proceedings.  Service Animals - Dogs that are individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are blind, alerting people who are deaf, pulling a wheelchair, alerting and protecting a person who is having a seizure, reminding a person with mental illness to take prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, or performing other duties. Service animals are working animals, not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.  Service Dog - A dog obtained from an accredited service dog organization approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a physical or mental disability. The dog is trained to respond to a verbal command or condition of the qualified Service member. Other species of animals, whether wild or domestic, trained or untrained, are not service dogs for the purposes of this definition. Dogs that are “in training” or whose sole function is to provide emotional support, comfort, therapy, or companionship are not service dogs.   2  BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 32-6005 29 JANUARY 2016 Civil Engineering UNACCOMPANIED HOUSING MANAGEMENT  COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and forms are available on the e-Publishing web site at www.e-Publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering.

Philosophy: 1.1.1.  Leadership at all levels is accountable for the success of the Air Force Unaccompanied Housing (UH) Program.  Emphasis on UH as a Quality of Life (QoL) issue and the impact on readiness  and  retention  have  driven  new  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  standards  and priorities.  Air Force dormitories and how we manage them are critical  to the development process  of unaccompanied Airmen.  The Secretary  of the Air Force (SECAF)  and Chief of Staff  of  the  Air  Force  (CSAF)  are  dedicated  to  providing  a  quality  unaccompanied  living environment  that  balances  needs  of  Airmen  with  the  needs  of  the  Air  Force.    Our  Air  and Space Expeditionary Force requires trained warriors and leaders, and the first 3  years of an Airman’s career are key years in shaping a future noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps. 1.1.2.  Development  and  training  extends  into  the  private  lives  and  living  quarters  of  each Airman.    The  UH  is  an  Airman’s  personal  residence  and  it  should  be  modern,  functional, well  maintained,  and  comfortable,  as  well  as  promote  pride,  professionalism,  and  personal dignity. 1.2.

(T-0) AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   13  Chapter 2 POLICY 2.1.  Unaccompanied  Housing  (UH)  Management  Concept.  Installation  UH  management  is the  responsibility  of  the  UH  Management  Section  aligned  under  the  Installation  Management Flight  within  the  CES/CEG.    UH  management  duties  are  performed  by  highly  motivated personnel dedicated to ensuring residents receive quality service. 2.1.1.  UH  Managers  carry  the  special  duty  identifier  (SDI)  8H000,  Airmen  Dorm  Leader, per  the  Air  Force  Enlisted  Classification  Directory,  and  assigned  for  two  years.    The  term Airmen  Dorm  Leader  (ADL)  is  equivalent  to,  and  may  be  used  synonymously  with, Unaccompanied Housing Manager (UH Manager). 2.1.1.1.  Installations  establish  a  local  ADL  hiring  process  to  advertise  and  solicit  best qualified  Airmen  from  assigned  base  personnel,  in  concert  with  the  AFPC  Personnel Services Delivery Guide for AFSC 8H000.  Process includes procedures to fill vacancies with  qualified  non-volunteers  when  vacancies  cannot  be  filled  with  volunteers.  The Installation  CCM  monitors  the  status  of  the  hiring  process  and  assignments  to  provide program management stability. 2.1.1.2.  ADLs  shall  not  be  functionally  responsible  for  furnishings  management  as  an additional duty.  (T-1) 2.1.2.  Manpower  authorizations  are  inherently  governmental  and  earned  based  on  an established manpower variance (currently one manager for a minimum of 50 rooms up to 145 rooms  and  one  manager  for  every  145  rooms  thereafter  based  on  the  long-range  DMP requirements).  Refer to AF Manpower Standard (AFMS) 44EH and 44EH0P (for Privatized Housing  locations)  for  variance  of  UH  manpower  standards  (see  AFI  38-201,  Chapter  2, para 2.8). 2.1.3.  Manning is primarily military to provide for mentoring and leadership responsibilities.  At least one civilian authorization is appropriate for program continuity. 2.1.3.1.  As  a  minimum,  designate  a  Master  Sergeant  or  civilian  equivalent  as  the  UH Management Section Chief /UH Superintendent. 2.1.3.2.  As  a  minimum,  designate  one  civilian  as  an  UH  Manager  (if  not  as  the  UH Management Section Chief) as appropriate based on total manpower authorizations. 2.1.3.3.  All other UH Managers are limited to NCOs (Technical and Staff Sergeants). 2.1.4.  BCE will ensure UH Managers receive required training to be proficient in the tasks identified  in  Air  Force  Job  Qualification  Standard  (AFJQS)  8H000,  Airmen  Dorm  Leader, within  90  days  after  being  appointed.  (T-1)    UH  managers  (superintendents  and  their deputies) are required to attend the Unaccompanied Housing Management course within six-months of assignment (within three-months is desired). (T-1)  Superintendents and deputies assigned  to  outside  the  continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  EQUAL-Plus  locations  are encouraged  to  obtain  training  prior  to  assignment.    As  needed,  consult  the  unit  training manager for guidance on the maintenance of training records.   14  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 2.1.5.  ADLs deploy in their primary AFSC and no more than 50 percent of the ADLs will be deployed at one time. (T-1)  ADLs (and their supervisors) are responsible for ensuring they remain  current  on  all  primary  AFSC-related  certifications  required  to  remain  worldwide deployable. (T-1) 2.2.  Unit    Integrity.  Unit  integrity  is  required  in  dormitories  at  all  installations  to  promote esprit-de-corps, camaraderie, and wingman principles among squadron and group members.  (T-1)  The Commander must approve space allocation for individual groups based on rooms being located in the same dormitory facility, on the same wing or floor, and grouped together.  (T-1)  The  focus  for  assignments  remains  on  the  squadron  level,  but  assignment  at  the  group  level complies  with  unit  integrity  policies  and  principles.    Where  space  is  not  available  in  a  single dormitory  for  an  individual  group,  assemble  together  additional  required  rooms  in  the  nearest dormitory. 2.3.  Space Allocation: 2.3.1.  The  UH  Management  Section  Chief  monitors  space  allocation  and  recommends changes  to  the  Housing  Manager.    At  minimum,  UH  Management  Section  will  conduct  a thorough space allocation assessment semi-annually. (T-1)  The Commander approves space reallocation adjustments that: 2.3.1.1.  Reallocate  existing  inventory  to  maintain  95  percent  utilization  in  each  UH facility. 2.3.1.2.  Authorize redistribution of required UH space based on a squadron population of Priority 1 and 2 unaccompanied personnel. 2.3.2.  Eligible members are assigned to rooms identified for use by their squadron. 2.3.2.1.  If a room is unavailable in the squadron allocated space for an arriving member, assign  member  to  a  hospitality  room  or  another  squadron  space  until  a  room  becomes available. 2.3.2.2.  Moves  resulting  from  space  reallocation  or  to  unit  integrity  are  considered government-directed.  Members directed to relocate are authorized a government-funded move and reimbursed services reconnection fees. 2.4.  Utilization: 2.4.1.  The  minimum  Air  Force  standard  for  utilization  of  permanent  party  dormitory, UNCOQ  and  UOQ  facilities  for  Priority  1  and  2  personnel  is  95  percent.    Optimum utilization is 95 percent for all priorities. 2.4.2.  Do  not  authorize  BAH  for  E-1  through  E-3  and  E-4  with  less  than  three  years  of service unless overall base-wide 95 percent utilization is maintained, or a validated hardship as approved by the Commander.  Authorize BAH based on UH assignment priorities. 2.4.3.  Dormitory  facilities  no  longer  needed  to  house  Priority  1  and  2  personnel  are considered surplus.  Identify surplus dormitories and take action to remove facilities from the UH inventory IAW the base DMP (see Paragraph 2.6). 2.4.3.1.  If  95  percent  utilization  cannot  be  maintained  in  each  dormitory,  UNCOQ  or UOQ for two consecutive quarters, the Commander must establish a get-well plan. (T-1)  The Installation Commander will submit an explanation regarding this circumstance with AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   15  the base quarterly UH metric along with the get-well plan and estimated completion date. (T-1) 2.4.3.2.  If 95 percent utilization cannot be maintained for four consecutive quarters (one year),  the  Commander  must  reallocate  the  existing  inventory  to  meet  95  percent utilization and remove surplus rooms from the inventory. (T-1) 2.4.4.  Utilization  of  pipeline  facilities  or  rooms  used  to  house  non-prior  service  (NPS) students are not included in installation utilization rate for Priorities 1 and 2. 2.5.  Diversions: 2.5.1.  The  total  base-wide  diversions  cannot  exceed  two  percent  of  the  base  inventory. Diversions included in the two percent threshold are: 2.5.1.1.  Divert  rooms  anticipated  to  be  unavailable  for  less  than  90  days  due  to  the accomplishment  of  minor  repairs  or  COM.  These  diversions  are  included  in  the  two percent diversion cap and in the utilization rate calculation. 2.5.1.2.  Divert rooms anticipated to be unavailable for individual assignment due to use as  UH  management  administrative  offices,  storage  space,  hospitality  rooms,  or  first sergeant  rooms.    These  diversions  are  included  in  the  two  percent  diversion  cap  but excluded in the utilization rate calculation. 2.5.2.  Exception to the two percent diversions threshold are: 2.5.2.1.  Divert rooms for use by pipeline students in facilities other than pipeline student dormitories.  These diversions are  excluded from the two percent  diversion cap and the utilization rate calculated separately. 2.5.2.2.  Divert  rooms  for  major  repairs  or  renovations  (structural,  plumbing,  electrical repairs,  or  renovation  work  such  as  bath  fixtures,  window  and  door  replacement,  or complete refurbishment).  These diversions are excluded from the two percent diversion cap  and  excluded  in  the  utilization  rate  calculation.    Diversions  can  start  when  projects are provided authority to advertise for award to allow timely relocation of residents prior to award date. 2.5.3.  Report diverted rooms on the quarterly UH metric as appropriate.  Conditions related to  the  diversion  of  rooms  for  more  than  4  consecutive  quarters  should  be  assessed  and consideration given to initiating action to surplus these facilities. 2.6.  Change-In-Use of Surplus Unaccompanied Housing (UH): 2.6.1.  The Commander can approve permanent changes in use of surplus UH facilities, while maintaining  the  integrity  of  the  DMP  (AFI  32-9002,  Use  of  Real  Property  Facilities).  The Commander  will  notify  MAJCOM  civil  engineer  and  AF/A4CF  when  a  change  in  use  of surplus UH facilities is accomplished.  (T-1) 2.6.1.1.  The  Commander  and  MAJCOM  civil  engineer  must  take  a  proactive, coordinated approach to identify and determine the disposition of surplus dormitories to maintain sound dormitory investment strategies. (T-1)   16  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 2.6.1.2.  Consider the  Area  Development  Plan),  activity management plans (AMP), force protection (FP) concerns, and building conditions when determining surplus dormitory facilities. the  DMP  (specifically 2.6.2.  The  Commander  must  ensure  surplus  dormitory  facilities  are  divested,  either demolished or permanently converted to another use, IAW DoD 4165.63-M.  (T-0) 2.6.2.1.  In  Continental  United  States  (CONUS),  surplus  dormitory  facilities  (721-312) may be converted to  UNCOQs (721-314)  and offered to  members in  grades E-4 with  3 YOS  or  higher  on  a  space-available  basis  (Priority  3  and  4)  if  base  anticipates  that  95 percent occupancy rate can be maintained.  See Paragraph 4.2 for Assignment Priorities. 2.6.2.2.  In  OCONUS,  surplus  dormitory  facilities  may  be  converted  to  UNCOQs  (721-314) or UOQs (724-415) and offered on a space available basis if base anticipates that 95 percent occupancy rate can be maintained. 2.6.2.3.  If  converted  to  UOQs  or  UNCOQs,  use  base  operations  and  maintenance (O&M)  funds  to  maintain  and/or  upgrade.    Apply  the  Air  Force  UH  Design  Guide standards and management practices for facility upgrades. 2.6.3.  Ensure  appropriate  approval  documents  are  obtained  and  real  property  records adjusted for surplus dormitory facilities to include the application of the UOQ and UNCOQs real property accounting codes.  AFI 32-9002, AFI 32-9003, Granting Temporary Use of Air Force  Real  Property,  AFI  32-9004,  Disposal  of  Real  Property,  and  AFI  32-9005,  Real Property  Accountability  and  Reporting,  apply to  managing  disposition  of  surplus dormitories. 2.6.4.  The  Commanders  do  not  have  the  authority  to  change  the  use  of  DMP-required facilities without AF/A4C approval. (T-1) 2.7.  Unaccompanied  Housing  Metric.  The  UH  metric  is  the  Air  Force  tool  for  determining utilization  of  UH  facilities,  providing  justification  for  space  reallocation,  authorizing  BAH, managing change of occupancy timelines, and supporting construction and renovation of assets. Installations  must  accomplish  reporting  requirements  via  MAJCOMs  IAW  latest  AF/A4CF guidance.  (T-1) 2.7.1.  The UH Management Section Chief maintains daily  auditable occupancy records for all UH facilities, accomplishes the UH quarterly metric as of 31 Mar, 30 Jun, 30 Sep, and 31 Dec  each  calendar  year  and  forwards  to  the  MAJCOM  accompanying  get-well  plan  IAW paragraph 2.4.3.1. 2.7.2.  Installation will certify and submit semi-annual utilization report and MAJCOMs will verify  their  installations  updates  in  eMH  UH  module  by  end  of  reporting  period  and  send forward to AF/A4CF to pull eMH utilization and occupancy reports.  (T-1) 2.8.  Tenant and Attached Unit Support.  The host base provides UH support to eligible tenant and attached unit personnel under the responsibility of the host installation, when possible. 2.8.1.  Support  is  provided  through  Support  Agreements  IAW  AFI  25-201,  Support Agreement  Procedures,  if  a  unit  or  element  of  one  MAJCOM  is  located  on  or  near  an installation  of  another  command.    Inter-Service  support  agreements  are  used  if  units  of another Service are located on or near an Air Force installation. AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   17  2.8.2.  Host base UH policy prevails where policy conflicts between tenant and host unit. The host base is the approving authority for tenant and attached unit UH BAH authorizations. 2.8.3.  If  Regular  Air  Force  members  are  assigned  to  a  geographically  separated  unit  at Reserve Component (AFRC and ANG) installations, the parent  MAJCOM commander will determine  whether  adequate  and  affordable  community  housing  is  insufficient  and government  leased  or  contracted  housing  is  necessary  to  meet  mission  or  training requirements for priority 2 members.  For these locations, Paragraph 2.10.1 applies. 2.9.  Training Facilities: 2.9.1.  Airmen  Training  Complex.  Housing  facilities  to  accommodate  basic  enlisted military  training  (BMT)  are  located  at  Joint  Base  San  Antonio-Lackland  (JBSA-Lackland).  These facilities are not administered by UH Managers. 2.9.2.  Non-Prior  Service  (NPS)  Student  Housing  (also  referred  to  as  ‘Pipeline Student’).  UH facilities constructed to support initial skills training for pipeline students at locations  defined  by  AETC  Instruction  36-2216,  Administration  of  Military  Standards  and Discipline  Training.    These  UH  facilities  are  not  administered  by  UH  Managers.    Refer  to AETC  Instruction 36-2216 for guidance regarding these facilities.  Non-AETC installations may  house  NPS  students  in  permanent  party  dorms  when  there  are  no  separate  pipeline student facilities.  These airmen are physically separated from permanent party residents by the  most  appropriate  means  (for  example,  a  different  floor  or  wing  of  the  building).    See Paragraphs 2.4.4 and 2.5.1.3. 2.9.3.  Officer  Training  School  (OTS).  Housing  facilities  constructed  to  support  OTS  are located at Maxwell AFB.  These facilities are not administered by UH Managers. 2.9.4.  Unaccompanied  Officer  Quarters  (UOQs).  Housing  facilities  used  to  support officer training other than OTS are administered by the UH Managers using this AFI. 2.9.5.  Cadet  Dormitories.  Housing  facilities  to  accommodate  United  States  Air  Force Academy  cadets  are  located  at  the  Academy.    These  facilities  are  not  administered  by  UH Managers. 2.10.  Leased and Contract Housing.  The Commander may lease or contract for UH facilities for Priority 1 and 2 personnel when adequate government-owned quarters are unavailable (IAW AFI 32-9001, Acquisition of Real Property). 2.10.1.  If  Regular  Air  Force  members  are  assigned  to  a  geographically  separated  unit  at Reserve component installations, the parent MAJCOM will provide contracted or leased UH quarters  for  regular  AF  members  in  the  grades  of  E-1  through  E-3  and  E-4  with  less  than three YOS assigned to a geographically separated unit at a AFRC or ANG installation when government provided housing is necessary to meet mission or training requirements. 2.10.2.  If Regular  Air Force members are assigned to  a  geographically separated unit at  or near non-DoD agencies, Government owned or leased UH housing can be acquired through inter-agency support agreement on a reimbursement basis for Priority 1 and 2 personnel from the  non-DoD  agency  when  the  parent  MAJCOM  commander  determines  adequate  and affordable  community  housing  is  insufficient  and  government-controlled  housing  is necessary to meet mission.   18  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 2.10.3.  If Air Force/DoD members are assigned to the Department of State (DoS) missions under  the  Chief  of  Mission  authority,  the  DoS  Chief  of  Mission  may  mandate  embassy housing  for  DoD  members  when  self-leasing  in  a  community  using  overseas  housing allowance (OHA) is  not  a viable option or due to safety/security  concerns.  When embassy housing  is  mandatory,  these  members  are  designated  as  Priority  1  and  housing  cost  and associated fees are funded from using O&M as required.  Use of FH funds is not authorized to  support  UH  requirements  and  the  MAJCOM  must  verify  status  of  member’s accompanying dependent. 2.10.4.  MAJCOM  may  authorize  installation  or  requiring  activity  to  lease/contract  UH quarters from private sector; 2.10.4.1.

Adequacy Standards for Constrained Housing Locations.  In areas where the installation Housing  Requirements  and  Market  Analysis  (HRMA)  justifies  a  deficit  of  adequate  and affordable off-base housing for any portion of unaccompanied E-4 with over 3 YOS through E-9 personnel and officers, the MAJCOM/CC may designate the affected grades of unaccompanied personnel as Priority 2, space required.  Installations should program to build UH for the affected grades as outlined in their base DMP.  At these installations, grades affected in the HRMA are housed on base at the appropriate standard provided in Table 3.1, Table 3.2 or Table 3.3. AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   29  3.3.  Exceptions to Adequacy Standards.  The Commander may reduce adequacy standards for a  period  not  to  exceed  (NTE)  30  days  for  reasons  of  military  necessity  or  to  satisfy  mission needs.  For periods exceeding 30 days, the MAJCOM civil engineer is the approval authority and must  provide  written  approval  to  the  installation  before  standards  are  reduced.    MAJCOMs notify  AF/A4CF  in  writing  of  the  approval  and  include  the  basis  for  reducing  standards,  the estimated get-well date,  and plan of action to  correct.   At AETC technical  training centers, the Commander may  approve the waiver for a period NTE 120 days.  MAJCOM CE will approve waivers for periods beyond 120 consecutive days. 3.3.1.  For AETC student  training dormitories on a non-AETC installation, the Commander may reduce adequacy standards for a period NTE 30 days for reasons of military necessity or to  satisfy  mission  needs.    For  periods  exceeding  30  days  to  NTE  120  days,  the  AETC Numbered AF commander (or equivalent at HQ AETC) must provide written approval to the base  before  standards  are  reduced.    Send  notification  to  AF/A4CF  via  the  AETC  Civil Engineer  and  include  the  basis  for  reducing  the  standards,  the  corrective  action  plan,  and estimated get-well date. 3.4.  Non-Air Force Installations.  When Air Force personnel are assigned to an Army, Navy or Marine  Corps  installation,  host  installation  service  adequacy  standards  apply,  except  where otherwise provided for in an official support agreement. 3.5.  Unaccompanied  Housing  (UH)  Programming  Criteria.  To  ensure  that  MAJCOMs  and bases appropriately plan, program, and budget for UH requirements, the Air Force uses a master planning  process.    The  plan  quantifies  projected  UH  requirements,  captures  facility  data, identifies  deficits  and  requirements  for  replacement,  and  provides  recommendations  and  cost estimates for  each installation UH program.     For current  dormitory programming information, Refer the latest Installation/Air Force DMP and AFMAN 32-1084, Facility Requirements. 3.6.  Unaccompanied  Housing  (UH)  Design  Guidance.  For UH design guidance, refer to the Air  Force  Unaccompanied  Housing  Design  Guide,  located  in  the  CE  Portal,  Housing  Program Group site, https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/ceportal/ProgramGroups/Housing/Pages/PolicyandStandards.aspx.

(T-1)    When  local  community  housing  is adequate  or  sufficient  to  house  civilians,  at  the  Commander’s  discretion,  issue termination notices to civilians who have occupied UH for 5 years or longer.   32  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 4.1.3.  US  Coast  Guard,  US  Public  Health  Service,  and  National  Oceanic  and Atmospheric  Administration.  Unaccompanied  personnel  from  these  agencies  may  be assigned  UH  using  priorities  determined  by  the  Commander.    Normally,  full-time unaccompanied personnel are assigned on the same basis as military members. 4.1.4.  Contractor Employees and Technical Representatives.  Unaccompanied personnel are not authorized to apply for or be  assigned UH unless designated K&E.  Exceptions are approved by MAJCOMs. 4.1.5.  US  Government,  non-DoD  personnel  in  foreign  areas  and  US  Territories  and Trusts.

Unaccompanied  personnel  (all  grades)  on  active  duty for  training  (school  and  annual  tours)  and  for  reasons  other  than  training  (man-days, activation,  mobilization),  as  determined  by  the  Commander  at  the  permanent  duty  station (PDS).    NOTE:    The  PDS  for  members  of  AFRC  and  ANG  components  ordered  to  active duty  for  training  is  the  training  location  to  which  each  member  travels.    The  PDS  for members  ordered  to  active  duty,  other  than  for  training,  is  their  monthly  drill  or  training station.    The  PDS  for  AFRC  members  who  have  no  monthly  drill  or  training  station,  i.e., individual ready reserve, some individual mobilization augmentees, standby reservists, is the place from which they were called or ordered to active duty. 4.1.8.  Foreign  Military  Trainees  (Foreign  Military  Sales  Trainee,  International Military  Education  and  Trainee  and  Security  Assistance  Trainee).    Unaccompanied members are eligible for UH on a space-available basis, or as stated in official agreements. 4.1.9.  Foreign Exchange Personnel in CONUS.

Personnel  (all  grades)  required  to  live  on  base  for reasons  of  military  necessity,  readiness  (to  include  FP),  training  mission,  or  discipline, including  unmarried  and  unaccompanied  married  incumbents  of  designated  K&E  positions and members with a bona fide hardship as determined by the Commander. 4.2.1.1.  Pipeline  students  who  are  not  authorized  per  diem  or  BAH  are  considered Priority 1. AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   33  4.2.1.2.  E-4 personnel who attain over 3 YOS and have less than 6 months remaining on station due to permanent change of station (PCS) or separation, convert from Priority 2 to Priority 1 and are not authorized to relocate off base with BAH. 4.2.1.3.  K&E positions that are listed in the base supplement to AFI 32-6001. 4.2.1.4.  For hardship assignments, members initiate and submit a request with squadron commander  endorsement  to  the  UH  Management  Section  Chief  who  processes  the request  to  Housing  Manager  with  a  recommendation.    The  Commander  is  authority  for approval; approval authority may be delegated, in writing, to the Mission Support Group commander or equivalent, but disapproval action remains with the Commander. 4.2.1.5.  Installation Commander must revalidate status of Priority 1 personnel (hardship assignment) annually. (T-2) 4.2.1.6.  Wounded  Warriors  (reporting  identifier  AFSC  9Wxxx)  are  provided  Priority  1 assignment status, but are not required to live in unaccompanied housing unless directed by the squadron commander on advice of the medical case manager. 4.2.2.  Priority  2,  Space  Required.    Beginning  with  the  most  junior  member,  Priority  2 includes: 4.2.2.1.  Personnel in grades E-1 through E-3 and E-4 with less than 3 YOS. 4.2.2.2.  All enlisted and officers assigned a location that has been approved as a housing constrained location for their specific grade. 4.2.2.3.  Involuntarily  separated  enlisted  and  officer  personnel  assigned  to  dependent- restricted areas. 4.2.2.4.  Unaccompanied  personnel  in  CONUS  and  non-foreign  OCONUS  with  no entitlement to family member travel and HHG transportation. 4.2.2.5.

Unaccompanied personnel in grades E-1 to E-9. 4.2.4.2.  Unaccompanied officers in OCONUS locations with established UOQs.   34  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 4.3.  Assignment  Priorities  in  Constrained  Housing  Locations.  When  the  HRMA  reflects  a deficit of adequate, affordable and safe off-base housing to support unaccompanied members in grades  E-4  with  3  or  more  YOS  through  E-9  and  officers  at  any  location,  the  MAJCOM commander  designates  the  affected  grades  of  unaccompanied  personnel  as  Priority  2,  space required. 4.4.  Waiting  List.  The  UH  Management  Section  manages  waiting  lists  for  assignment  to  and termination from UH. 4.4.1.  Priority  1  members  must  have  written  approval  from  the  Commander  to  relocate  off base.  (T-1) 4.4.2.  Priority 2 waiting list for BAH.  Maintain a base-wide BAH waiting list of Priority 2 members desiring to relocate off base with BAH.  Ensure local procedures require squadron commander  and/or  first  sergeant  approval  prior  to  member  notification  of  selection  and authorizing BAH. (T-3) 4.4.3.  Priority  2  waiting  list  for  assignment  to  UH.    Maintain  a  list  of  members  waiting assignment to UH due to insufficient UH space in grades E-1 through E-3, E-4 with less than 3  YOS,  and  others  in  approved  constrained  housing  locations  in  the  grades  of  E-4  with  3 YOS through E-9 and officers. 4.4.4.  Priority 3 and 4 waiting list for assignment to UH.  Maintain a list of Priority 3 and 4 members requesting assignment to UH on a space available basis. 4.5.  Temporary Accommodations: 4.5.1.  Hospitality  Room.  Provide  a  hospitality  room  as  temporary  accommodations  for unaccompanied  eligible  personnel  arriving  and  departing  during  non-duty  hours.    Include designated rooms in the total rooms authorized for diversion but do not assign the member to the room. 4.5.1.1.  UH  Manager  notifies  first  sergeant  or  squadron  commander  when  there  is  no available UH permanent party room or hospitality room for arriving eligible members, so arrangements can be made for temporary accommodations in lodging.  Members eligible for UH and occupying lodging facilities pay the daily lodging fee. 4.5.2.  First Sergeant Room.  Installations may elect to use UH rooms to provide space for temporary  accommodations  for  personnel  involved  in  extraordinary  situations  (such  as domestic  altercations).    Keep  the  number  of  rooms  used  for  this  purpose  to  an  absolute minimum (minimum adequacy standards do not apply) and limit a member’s stay to no more than a total of 72 hours.  Give special consideration to location within the dormitory campus for  rooms  designated  for  this  purpose  and  furnish  with  only  essential  furniture  (i.e.  bed, chest).    Include  designated  rooms  in  the  total  rooms  authorized  for  diversion  but  do  not assign the member to the room. 4.5.2.1.  The UH Management Section Chief will be responsible for the management of First Sergeant rooms. (T-1) 4.5.2.2.  The First Sergeant must certify/sign for each usage of these rooms.  (T-1) AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   35  4.6.  Assignment  Criteria  and  Procedures.  The Air Force assignment standard is one private room  for  each permanent  party  Airman  (E-1 through E-3 and  E-4 with  less  than 3 YOS).  See Paragraph 3.3 for exceptions to adequacy standards. 4.6.1.  Assignment Criteria. 4.6.1.1.  UH Manager assigns member to a private room, including UOQs and UNCOQs, as soon as possible after an eligible member arrives on the installation. 4.6.1.2.  Assign  members  to  appropriate  UH  allocated  for  their  group  or  squadron  to ensure unit integrity. 4.6.1.3.  Authorize BAH to inbound Priority 2 members who are E-4s within 60 days of having three YOS so that they may obtain off-base housing immediately upon arrival on station. 4.6.1.4.  E-4s residing in dormitories reaching 3 YOS may voluntarily become a Priority 3 and occupy a dormitory on a space-available basis without BAH (Exception:  E-4s in this category with less than 6 months remaining on station convert to Priority 1).  If the government  requires  a  move  to  another  on-base  facility,  the  move  is  at  government expense.  Voluntary moves to another on-base facility are at the member’s expense.  Any subsequent move off base is at government expense. 4.6.1.5.  Priority 3 and 4 members relocating from off base into UH on a space-available basis,  are  not  authorized  a  government-paid  move.    Lower  grade  members  have precedence for space available assignment. 4.6.1.6.  MIL-to-MIL  members  on  separate  unaccompanied  assignments  to  a  same dependent-restricted  location  are  treated  as  individual  members.    Each  member  is assigned individual UH quarters/room and can be assigned to the same module in 1+1 or 2+2 configurations, but not in a D4A module; joint residence is not allowed as it creates an accompanied housing requirement; and dependent children are not authorized.  Other procedures in this paragraph apply. 4.6.2.  Assignment  Considerations.  When  determining  room  assignments  UH  Managers address the following issues: 4.6.2.1.  Males  and  Females.  UH Managers must house males and females in separate modules but may assign them in the same facility. (T-1)  A module is either a D4A four-room suite, or the two-room/one bathroom suite in the 1+1 and 2+2 dorms. 4.6.2.2.  Smokers and Non-smokers.  UH Managers must attempt to assign smokers with smokers  and  nonsmokers  with  nonsmokers  considering  UH  room  and  module configurations. (T-1) See  Paragraph  2.20.  If a smoker and nonsmoker are assigned to the  same  room  or  module,  the  rights  of  the  nonsmoker  prevail.    If  a  nonsmoker  detects second-hand smoke, regardless of its source, the rights of the nonsmoker prevail. 4.6.3.  Assignment  Procedures.  UH  Managers  process  following  assignment  actions, including UOQs and UNCOQs and will: 4.6.3.1.  Make  assignment/termination  actions  in  writing  using  approved  automated software system. (T-1)  Ensure Priority 3 and 4 personnel acknowledge, in writing, that: (T-1)   36  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 4.6.3.1.1.  They are occupying UH on a space-available basis and may be required to terminate quarters with 30 days’ notice. 4.6.3.1.2.  Moves into and out of UH, including local drayage, nontemporary storage (NTS)  of  personal  property  and  service  reconnections  (cable  TV,  telephone,  and internet)  are  at  their  own  expense.    Exception:  Government-funded  moves  are authorized when space-available members are directed to move from an assigned on- base  dormitory  room  to  another  on-base  dormitory  room  for  the  convenience  of  the government for reasons such as major repairs, renovations, and demolitions. 4.6.3.2.  Accomplish  AF  Form  594,  Application  and  Authorization  to  Start,  Stop  or Change Basic Allowance For Housing (BAH) or Dependency Redetermination for every UH assignment to include E-1 through E-3 and E-4 with less than three YOS personnel. (T-1) 4.6.3.3.  Perform  an initial inspection of the UH facility and room with the resident and ensure discrepancies are annotated in writing  and acknowledged by the resident and the UH Manager. (T-0)  See Attachment 2 for location of sample checklist. 4.6.3.4.  Provide  a  Resident  Brochure  identifying  applicable  Air  Force,  MAJCOM,  and local base standards. (T-1) See Attachment 2 for location of sample brochure. 4.6.3.5.  Provide bedding to include sheets, pillowcases, mattress pads, pillow protectors, blankets, bedspreads, etc. (T-1) 4.6.3.6.  Perform  an  inventory  and  assessment  of  furnishings  and  use  AF  Form  228  or eMH generated form to issue and identify condition of room furnishings. (T-1) 4.6.3.7.  Use locally developed checklists to ensure residents acknowledge receipt of the Resident Brochure, linens, condition of room and any other locally required information. (T-3) 4.6.3.7.1.  UH Managers will ensure members acknowledge in writing that they are to reside in the assigned room provided unless otherwise approved by the first sergeant or squadron commander. (T-1) 4.6.3.8.  Maintain all UH records to include those related to determinations made by the Commander. (T-1) 4.7.  Involuntary Assignments.  Involuntary assignments to UH are made when: 4.7.1.  Required for reasons of military necessity, readiness or discipline.  This applies to all personnel and to adequate and inadequate quarters. 4.7.2.  Occupancy  of  adequate  UH  by  Priority  1  and  2  personnel  is  below  95  percent utilization. 4.7.2.1.  Involuntary assignments in CONUS and OCONUS apply to all Priority 1 and 2 personnel  and  those  grade  groups  identified  in  constrained  location  approval.    Make assignments beginning with the most junior member. 4.7.2.2.  Provide members 30 days advance written notice of an involuntary assignment. 4.7.3.  Make  every  effort  to  fill  UH  vacancies  with  newly  arrived  personnel.    If  projected unaccompanied personnel gains do not increase the utilization rate to 95 percent within 120 AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   37  days, the Commander must recall Priority 1 and 2 personnel previously authorized to live off base and receive BAH, unless the member is a Priority 2 with grade of E-4 within 60 days of reaching  three  years  of  service.    (T-1)    Additionally,  before  recalling  personnel,  the Commander  reviews  the  member’s  situation  (i.e.,  lease  term  and  other  commitments  the member  may  have  incurred  as  a  result  of  moving  off-base)  to  prevent  a  financial  hardship situation. Moves are at government expense. 4.7.4.  Unless  required  for  military  necessity,  readiness  or  discipline,  do  not  involuntarily assign  personnel  in  grades  E-1  to  E-3  and  E-4  with  less  than  3  YOS,  under  the  following conditions: 4.7.4.1.  Member has official notification to depart the installation due to PCS. 4.7.4.2.  After the death of a sole family member. 4.7.4.3.  A military married to military couple resides off base.  One spouse is reassigned to another base and one remains at the original location. 4.7.4.4.  The  Commander  determines  that  a  member  is  experiencing  a  hardship.    (For example, member made permanent  off-base housing arrangement;  requires the sale of a home; or requires financial penalties resulting from the terms of existing lease.) 4.7.5.  Civilian  employees  may  not  be  involuntarily  assigned  to  occupy  on-base  quarters, except  when  required  by  military  necessity  or  FP.    If  the  civilian  employee  refuses permanent,  adequate,  and  available  on-base  housing  in  foreign  countries  and  U.S.  overseas areas (DoDI 1400.25, Volume 1250), LQA is not authorized for off-base housing. 4.8.  Termination  Criteria  and  Procedures.  UH Managers process termination actions for all UH to include UOQs and UNCOQs.  UH Managers must: 4.8.1.

To  provide  needed  space  for  Priority  1  and  2  personnel.    Use  the  following guidelines: 4.8.1.6.1.  Terminate Priority 4 and then Priority 3 personnel, senior member first. 4.8.1.6.2.  Authorize  BAH  to  Priority  2  personnel  (all  grades)  on  the  BAH  waiting list,  senior  member  first,  when  utilization  of  total  space  required  (Priority  1  and  2) personnel exceeds 95 percent.  Note: Airmen approved from the BAH waiting list are authorized for a government paid move. 4.8.2.  Terminate assigned dormitory room in two phases: (T-1) 4.8.2.1.  Prefinal  Inspection.    UH  Manager  conducts  the  prefinal  inspection  in  advance (generally 30 to 45 days) of member vacating UH. 4.8.2.1.1.  Provide residents written cleaning standards used for final inspection. See Attachment 2, Sample Cleaning Standards, which may be adjusted to meet local base needs. 4.8.2.1.2.  Assess condition of assigned rooms/shared common space and furnishings as compared to discrepancies noted at the initial inspection to determine damages or loss.  Provide members detailed written information regarding financial liabilities and include  alternatives  for  restitution  and/or  repair  as  soon  as  possible  to  ensure requirements are accomplished before final inspection. 4.8.2.1.3.  Identify maintenance required to make the unit ready for the next resident. See Attachment 2 for location of sample COM checklist. 4.8.2.2.  Final  Inspection.    Ensure  resident  meets  cleaning  standards  established  by  the Commander  and  the  room  is  cleared  of  personal  property.    Allow  resident  to  correct minor  items  during  the  final  inspection.    If  the  unit  fails  inspection,  schedule  a reinspection  at  the  earliest  mutually  acceptable  time  to  minimize  delay  of  resident departure. 4.8.2.2.1.  After  a  successful  final  inspection,  the  UH  Manager  initiates  and  issues computer-generated  Unaccompanied  Quarters  Assignment-Termination  Record certifying termination. 4.8.2.2.2.

An unaccompanied member’s entitlement to BAH may  be  affected  by  assignment  to  UH.    The  implementing  DoD  Directive  is  DoDD  5154.29, DoD  Pay  and  Allowances  Policy  and  Procedures.  Refer  to  Joint  Travel  Regulation  (JTR), Chapter 10. 5.1.1.  Unaccompanied personnel assigned to UH are authorized partial BAH.  Partial BAH is  not  authorized  when  members  occupy  leased  or  contract  quarters  which  cost  more  than BAH or OHA.  The FSO automatically starts partial BAH for unaccompanied members not authorized without-dependent BAH. 5.1.2.  Unaccompanied personnel are authorized to live off base and receive single rate BAH when  dormitory,  UNCOQ,  and  UOQ  utilization  of  Priority  1  and  2  personnel  exceeds  95 percent (in any of these housing categories, not all three categories together).  Members, with approval  by  the  first  sergeant  or  squadron  commander,  are  eligible  to  apply  for  the  BAH waiting list.  Local procedures may also require obtaining squadron commander and/or first sergeant approval prior to member notification of selection and authorization of BAH. 5.1.2.1.  Personnel who voluntarily live off base without BAH are not  automatically the most eligible and must compete with other members on the BAH waiting list to receive BAH. (T-1) 5.1.2.2.  The  UH  Management  Section  maintains  a  single  BAH  waiting  list  system  by seniority.  Installation  Commander  must  ensure  the  waiting  list  provides  equitable allocation  of  dormitory  space  among  squadrons  and  minimizes  frequent  dormitory resident  moves.  (T-1)    The  UH  Management  Section  Chief  will  monitor  individual dormitory  utilization  rates,  advise  the  Housing  Manager  when  individual  facilities  are causing the base-wide dormitory utilization rate to fall below 95 percent, and recommend space reallocation or change in use.  (T-1) 5.1.2.2.1.  Single  base-wide  BAH  waiting  list.  When  a  single  base-wide  BAH waiting  list  adversely  impacts  unit  integrity  or  causes  hardship  to  unaccompanied Airmen  by  forcing  frequent  moves  among  dorms,  the  Commander  may  authorize BAH waiting lists by individual facility (dormitory) or unit. 5.1.2.2.2.  Facility  (dormitory)  or  unit  BAH  waiting  list.  If  the  base-wide utilization rate is greater than 95 percent and the dormitory rate of a specific dorm is below 95 percent  utilization,  do not  issue BAH until  that dormitory  rate  exceeds 95 percent. 5.1.3.  There  are  conditions  when  unaccompanied  personnel  are  authorized  to  live  off  base with  allowances, regardless  of the utilization rate or availability of  government quarters, as long  as  the  Commander  does  not  require  them  to  live  on  base  for  reasons  of  military necessity,  readiness,  or  discipline.    The  following  moves  from  UH  to  off  base  are  at government expense. 5.1.3.1.  Personnel  (without  dependent  family  members  anywhere)  in  grades  E-4  with  3 YOS and above.   40  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 5.1.3.1.1.  Inbound  E-4  members  within  60  days  of  attaining  3  YOS  will  be authorized  BAH  and  they  obtain  off-base  housing  immediately  upon  arrival  on station.  (T-3) 5.1.3.1.2.  E-4s attaining 3 YOS will not be authorized to move off base with BAH if they have less than 6 months remaining on station prior to PCS or separation from the Air Force unless the move meets requirements in paragraph 5.1.3.4, 5.1.3.6 or 5.1.3.8.  (T-1) 5.1.3.1.3.  Normally,  BAH  for  newly  assigned  members  in  grades  E-4  with  3  YOS and above continues from their last duty station; however, if necessary, the local FSO starts  BAH  during  in-processing  once  the  member  has  certified  non-occupancy  of government quarters. 5.1.3.1.4.  Airmen  who  become  eligible  for  BAH  as  a  result  of  promotion  or  due  to reaching  3  YOS  as  an  E-4  during  a  deployment  may  make  arrangements  to  out-process prior to departure.  Another military member, with a valid power of attorney, may  terminate  UH  on  behalf  of  the  deployed  member  on  the  date  he/she  becomes eligible  for  the  entitlement.    Airmen,  who  chose  to  move  off  base  and/or  store  the contents prior to that date, may do so at their own expense and with approval from the first  sergeant  or  squadron  commander.    The  UH  Management  Section  Chief  will process  an  AF  Form 594 only  when the member is  eligible  and the room  is  cleared IAW with local policies.  (T-1) 5.1.3.2.  Personnel  with  a  hardship  may  submit  a  unit  commander-endorsed  request  to reside in community housing and receive BAH based on a hardship condition to the UH Management Section Chief for coordination. 5.1.3.2.1.  The Commander is the approval authority for a hardship request.  Approval authority may be delegated, in writing, to the Mission Support Group commander or equivalent, but disapproval action remains with the Commander. 5.1.3.2.1.1.  A  hardship  can  be  described  as  a  unique  and  unusual  circumstance that,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Commander,  imposes  an  extraordinary  burden  on  a member  not  normally  encountered  by  other  members  of  similar  grade  at  that installation. 5.1.3.2.2.  The  UH  Management  Section  Chief  provides  a  recommendation  to Housing  Manager  who the  Commander  for approval/disapproval. then  forwards the  request to 5.1.3.2.3.  The  member  must  provide  annual  recertification  to  the  UH  Management Section Chief to continue the entitlement.  (T-0) 5.1.3.3.  Personnel  with  privately  owned  mobile  homes  moved  from  the  previous  duty station  to  the  new  duty  station  at  government  expense  if  the  mobile  home  is  acquired on/before  the  member’s  PCS  order  effective  (publish)  date.    Single  members  with privately  owned  mobile  homes  may  submit  a  request  to  reside  in  the  community  and receive BAH.  The request must include a copy of the authorization to move the mobile home  to  the  new  duty  station  at  government  expense  and  the  member  must  certify  the intent to use the mobile home as a residence at the new location. (T-0)  See Joint Travel AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   41  Regulation  (JTR),  Chapter  5,  Part  A,  Section  7,  for  eligibility  for  mobile  home transportation. 5.1.3.4.  Pregnant women may be authorized to move from UH with BAH per 2.18.1. 5.1.3.5.  Personnel with extensive HHG may submit a unit commander-endorsed request to the UH Management Section to reside in community housing and receive BAH when the  annual  cost  of  drayage  and  storage  would  exceed  50  percent  of  authorized  BAH (drayage  +  12  months  storage)/by  12  months  >  (monthly  BAH  rate)/2).    UH Manager/ADL  must  conduct  a  physical  inventory  of  items  against  HHG  shipping documents with a member and forwards requests to the Commander for approval.  (T-1)  If  annual  cost  is  below  50  percent  of  authorized  BAH,  Priority  1  or  2  members  may request  storage  of  items  that  were  shipped  at  government  expense  and  do  not  fit  in  the assigned  dormitory  room  or  in  a  secured  dormitory  storage  area.    UH  Manager/ADL prepares  an  AF  Form  150,  Drayage/Storage  Authorization  -  Government  Quarters  for approval  of  Non-Temporary  Storage  (NTS).    See  Paragraph  5.3  for  local  drayage  and NTS of personal property. 5.1.3.6.  Personnel within 60 days of marriage, if setting up a household in the local area. Members  may  submit  an  unit  commander-endorsed  request  to  the  UH  Management Section to reside in community housing and receive BAH up to 60 days prior to pending marriage.    BAH  may  not  be  started  until  the  member  properly  out-processes  his/her dormitory  room.    Within  30  days  after  the  date  the  marriage  was  scheduled  to  occur, member  must  submit  proof  of  marriage  to  continue  BAH.      If  the  marriage  does  not occur, paragraph 4.2 applies. (T-1) 5.1.3.7.  Personnel  who  are  military  married  to  military  (join-spouse  assignment)  who have  an  approved  join-spouse  assignment  may  submit  a  request  to  move  from  assigned UH to community housing and receive BAH 60 days prior to arrival of the spouse.  If the join-spouse assignment does not occur, paragraph 4.2 applies. 5.1.3.8.  Agents  or  agent-trainees  with  the  Office  of  Special  Investigation  (OSI)  may submit  a  request  to  the  UH  Management  Section  to  reside  in  community  housing  and receive  BAH.    The  request  includes  an  Air  Force  OSI  region  commander  or  squadron commander certification that assignment to UH would impair agent or the agent trainee’s mission effectiveness. 5.1.3.9.  Personnel with approved terminal leave may request to move from assigned UH to  community  housing  and  receive  BAH.  The  request  includes  documentation  that  the member is on terminal leave. 5.1.3.10.  AFRC  and  ANG  personnel  on  active  duty  for  training.  BAH  entitlement for  AFRC  and  ANG  members  is  determined  by  the  availability  of  UH  at  each  training location.  Each training location is viewed as a different PDS. 5.1.3.10.1.  When UH is not available, the unit at the PDS prepares and sends to the UH management section chief an AF Form 594 and member’s orders on an AF Form 1373,  MPO  Document  Control  Log-on  Transmittal,  and  include  a  letter  of determination  from  the  unit  commander  when  necessary.    The  UH  management section  chief  signs  and  forwards  all  documents  to  the  member’s  servicing  pay  FSO (provided by the ARC component) for processing.   42  AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016 5.1.3.11.  Members in an ARC component on active duty tours other than for training are entitled to BAH under the same conditions as members serving on full-time active duty. Use the same process specified in paragraph 5.1.3.10.1. 5.1.4.  Members  who residing elsewhere.  Members with dependents residing elsewhere may occupy UH without affecting their right to receive BAH, at the with-dependent rate, under certain circumstances. are  unaccompanied  but  have  dependents 5.1.4.1.  A  member  may  occupy  UH  or  other  government  housing  that  does  not  exceed UH standards (Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3) for the member’s  grade without dependents  and still  be  eligible  to  receive  BAH  at  the  with-dependent  rate  if  (a)  the  member  is unaccompanied and (b) family members are not residing in adequate government quarters elsewhere (JTR Paragraph 10306-H). 5.1.4.2.  The  following  only  applies  to  personnel  designated  K&E  (all  others  are ineligible for this exception).  If the member occupies UH or other government quarters which  exceed  the  unaccompanied  standard  for  the  member’s  grade,  BAH  will  be terminated  unless  the  quarters  are  the  only  quarters  available  and  (a)  quarters  are  not suitable  for  joint  occupancy  (see  Table  5.1)  or  (b)  quarters  are  suitable  for  joint occupancy  and  are  jointly  occupied  with  another  member  of  the  appropriate  grade permanently assigned to the duty station.  (T-0) 5.1.4.2.1.  Air  Force  policy  is  to  discourage  the  use  of  government-owned  or privatized  FH  units  as  temporary  UH.    FH  units  or  other  quarters  temporarily designated as UH will be considered adequate for joint occupancy if they have at least two private bedrooms, two separate full bathrooms, with a total net living area at least equivalent to the total net living area the joint residents would each be entitled to if it were permanent UH. (T-1) Members in grades O-1 to O-10, W-1 to W-5 and GS-10 and above must have access to a living room, kitchen and dining area (not necessarily private) as shown in Table 5.1. (T-1) 5.1.4.2.2.  Regarding  clause  (b)  in  paragraph  5.1.4.2,  the  quarters  must  actually  be jointly  occupied,  although  such  quarters  may  be  singularly  occupied  for  no  longer than  30  days  in  order  to  accommodate  a  change  in  one  of  the  joint  residents  who departs  PCS.    (T-0)    The  Deputy  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for Environment,  Safety  and  Infrastructure  (SAF/IEE)  must  approve  waivers  to  this policy to relieve hardship circumstances (other than financial). 5.1.4.3.  This  policy  does  not  apply  to  unaccompanied  members  residing  in  privatized housing since members pay rental charges for PH. 5.1.4.4.  This policy applies to all locations and to FH units or other government quarters temporarily designated as UH. 5.1.4.5.  Unaccompanied  members  should  be  assigned  quarters  that  meet  adequacy standards for their grade, whenever possible. 5.1.5.  The  UH  Management  Section  is  responsible  for  processing  AF  Form  594  for unaccompanied personnel assigned UH. 5.1.5.1.  The  UH  Management  Section  prepares  AF  Form  594  annotating  the  date  and address  of  the  UH  being  assigned  or  terminated  and  forwards  the  AF  Form  594  to  the AFI32-6005  29 JANUARY 2016   43  FSO for processing.  The FSO determines dependency and BAH entitlements and records required changes on the AF Form 594. 5.1.5.1.1.  For  Army,  Navy,  and  Marine  Corps  members,  the  UH  Management Section prepares the AF Form 594 and forwards to the appropriate servicing FSO as identified by the squadron or member. 5.1.5.2.
