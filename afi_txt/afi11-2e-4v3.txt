The CCO/NCOIC should recommend needed EWO personnel.  3.3.  Flight Duty Period (FDP). 3.3.1.  Reserve Crews. FDP begins one hour after the crew is notified to report for duty. 16 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 3.3.2.  FDP  Extensions.  When  requested  by  the  aircraft  commander,  the  55  WG/CC  may grant  a  2  hour  FDP  extension  to  a  basic  crew  FDP.  Any  augmented  crew  FDP  extension requires HQ ACC/A3 approval. 3.3.2.1.  FDP extensions apply to both flight crew and mission crew in an equal amount. 3.3.3.  Because the mission crew is considered augmented, the mission crew FDP is 24 hours. When  mission  requirements  dictate,  consider  adding  additional  mission  crewmembers  as necessary  to  maximize  in-flight  rest  opportunities.  EXCEPTION:  The  maximum  FDP  for mission  crews  with  less  than  the  applicable  crew  complement  outlined  in  Table  3.2  is  16 hours. 3.3.3.1.  Mission  crewmembers  may  have  their  FDP  terminate  in  flight.  These  mission crewmembers  will  cease  performing  official  in-flight  duties.  (T-2)  Per  AFI  11-401, paragraph  3.3.5,  these  crewmembers  will  log  other  time  during  periods  of  crew  rest  or sleep. (T-2) 3.3.4.  The flight crew must complete transition training (i.e., multiple patterns, approaches, landings, and/or A/R training) during the first 12 hours of the flight crew’s FDP. (T-2) In no case  can this prevent  missions from  continuing to the final  destination once training  events are  accomplished.  Mission  crew  FDP  does  not  affect  the  events  associated  with  this paragraph. EXCEPTION: Transition training may be completed during the first 16 hours of the  flight  crew’s  FDP  for  aircrew  evaluation  or  initial  qualification  sorties  with  OG/CC approval to extend transition duty day to 16 hours. 3.4.  Crew Rest.  Consult AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules, for additional guidance. 3.4.1.  En Route Crew Rest and Ground Times. 3.4.1.1.  Non-alert missions should be planned with a minimum of 17 hours ground time between  engine  shutdown  and  subsequent  takeoff.  If  extended  post  flight  duties  are anticipated, ground time is adjusted to allow a full 12 hours crew rest prior to the start of the next FDP. When possible, flight crews should be afforded crew rest times in excess of the minimum to give crews the opportunity to overcome the cumulative effects of fatigue while flying consecutive days or transiting time zones. 3.4.2.  Alert/SSM Missions. Once provided the opportunity for at least 8 hours uninterrupted rest, an aircrew member may start a new FDP. The crew rest period for alert is defined as the period  when  official  alert  duties  are  not  being  performed.  Crew  rest  is  free  time,  which includes time for meals and rest. 3.4.2.1.  Mission  crews  may  perform  a  maximum  of  12  hours  ground  alert  duty  after flight and/or deadheading, provided they are afforded the following: 3.4.2.1.1.  Eight  hours  continuous  rest  in  the  10  hours  immediately  preceding  the ground duty alert period. 3.4.2.1.2.  Each applicable mission crew member will be provided an on-board bunk or passenger seat for their crew rest. (T-2) 3.4.2.1.3.  After this ground alert duty, mission crew members will be afforded a full 12 hours crew rest before subsequent FDP can begin. (T-2) AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 17 3.4.2.1.4.  Mission  crew  members  will  be  relieved  as  soon  as  suitable  replacements are crew-rested IAW 3.4.2. (T-2) 3.4.3.  Post-Mission  Crew  Rest  (PMCR).  Aircrew  members  returning  to  home  station  from extended, multi-day missions should be given sufficient time to recover from the cumulative effects  of  the  mission  and  tend  to  personal  needs.  PMCR  begins  upon  mission  termination and/or  the  completion  of  official  mission/alert  duties.  Crewmembers  should  receive  1  hour (maximum of 96 total hours) for every 3 hours off-station and/or on alert. 3.5.  Standby Force Duty. 3.5.1.  Reserve  Standby  Force.  As  required,  the  1  ACCS/CC  shall  posture  aircrews  as  a Reserve Standby Force able to show for duty 1 hour after notification. (T-3) Unless approved otherwise  by  the  1  ACCS/DO,  the  Reserve  Standby  Force  will  remain  in  the  local  Omaha area  (able  to  respond  to  work  within  1  hour  from  time  of  notification).  (T-3)  The  1 ACCS/DO may adjust response times as necessary for mission accomplishment.  3.5.2.  Telephone  Standby  Crews.  As  required,  the  1  ACCS  shall  posture  aircrews  as  a Telephone Standby Force ready to enter pre-mission crew rest within 2 hours. (T-3) Tasked aircrews will be legal to show for duty 12 hours after entering crew rest. (T-2) 3.6.  Mission Alerting Procedures. 3.6.1.  Crewmembers normally self-alert for all missions and trainers. 3.6.2.  When  necessary,  the  1  ACCS/DO  may  set  a  crew  legal-for-alert  (LFA)  time  to provide greater flexibility for mission accomplishment. Crews with a LFA time do not show for duty until notified.  Crews will show NLT 1 hour after notification. (T-2) 3.7.  Aircrew Release Policy.  The aircrew release policy is as follows: 3.7.1.  Reserve and Telephone Standby Crews. Release time is 0730 the first duty day after assuming standby duty or as established by the 1 ACCS/DO. 3.7.2.  Aircrews with a LFA Time. If not “alerted” within 12 hours of the LFA time, the crew will be released or reentered into crew rest. 3.7.3.  Local Trainers. 3.7.3.1.  If a training sortie cannot depart within 4 hours of the scheduled takeoff time due to  maintenance,  weather  or  other  events,  the  crew  should  be  released.  The  AC,  with 1ACCS/DO  concurrence,  may  extend  the  takeoff  window  as  necessary  for  mission accomplishment. 3.7.4.  Operational Missions (Alert, PSM, SSM, etc). The 1 ACCS/DO, in conjunction with the NAOC OTC, will direct aircrew release. (T-0) 18 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 AIRCRAFT OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  General.  Aircrews will reference the aircraft flight manual T.O. 1E-4B(II)-1, E-4B Flight Manual,  T.O.  1E-4B-1-1,  E-4B  Performance  Data  Manual,  T.O.  1E-4B(II)-43-1-1,  E-4B Command Control and Communications (C3) Systems Operations Manual  and T.O. 1E-4B(II)- 43-2-1, E-4B Organizational Flightline Maintenance Instructions  C3 Systems, Boeing Dispatch Deviation Guide and/or the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), as applicable, to determine aircraft status and any pertinent operating restrictions. (T-2) AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 19 Chapter 5 OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES 5.1.  Duty Stations.  Both pilots and the engineer shall be in their seats during critical phases of flight  and  as  required  by  AFI  11-202  V3.  (T-0)  During  non-critical  phases  of  flight,  only  one pilot or the flight engineer will be absent from his/her duty station at any one time. (T-1) When additional  crewmembers  are  on  board,  the  jump  seat  should  be  occupied  to  assist  the  crew  in avoiding  other  aircraft,  birds,  etc.,  during  critical  phases  of  flight.  Cockpit  crewmembers  will notify the pilot prior to departing their assigned primary duty station. (T-2) 5.2.  Takeoff and Landing Policy.  A qualified AC will occupy one of the pilot seats during all takeoffs and landings. (T-2) The designated AC is not required to occupy a primary position, but still retains overall authority for conduct of the mission. 5.3.  Seat Belts.  All occupants will have a designated seat with a seat belt. (T-2) Crewmembers will  have  seat  belts  fastened  when  occupying  a  duty  position  unless  crew  duties  dictate otherwise. (T-2) 5.4.  Flight  Deck  Communications  Policy.  Recorded  aircraft  crew  communications  represent official communications, and aircrew should be aware they have no expectation of privacy. 5.4.1.  Sterile  Flight  Deck.  Limit  conversation  to  that  essential  for  crew  coordination  and mission  accomplishment  during  taxi,  critical  phases  of  flight,  and  flight  below  10,000  feet MSL. 5.4.2.  Advisory  Calls.  The  pilot  flying  periodically  announces  his/her  intentions  during critical phases of flight and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. 5.4.2.1.  In addition to the mandatory calls found in the flight manual, the pilot not flying (PNF)  will  make  calls  when  passing  transition  level,  approaching  1000  feet  above  or below  any  assigned  altitude,  VVIs  in  excess  of  1000  ft/min  below  500  feet  AGL,  and during landing when the pitch exceeds 8 degrees. (T-2) 5.4.2.2.  Any  crewmember  will  announce  an  altitude  deviation  of  200  feet  or  more,  an airspeed  deviation  of  10  knots  or  more,  or  any  potential  terrain,  obstruction  or  traffic clearance problem.(T-3) 5.4.3.  Aircraft  Interphone.  All  crewmembers  will  monitor  interphone  except  when  crew duties  or  physiological  needs  dictate  otherwise.  (T-3)  Hot-mic  (if  available)  should  be monitored to the max extent possible, but may be toggled off for short periods when its use impedes  the  accomplishment  of  essential  duties.  Crewmembers  will  notify  the  AC  prior  to checking off interphone and/or hot-mic. (T-2) 5.4.4.  Command Radios 5.4.4.1.  The  flight  deck  requires  at  least  one  UHF  command  radio  plus  guard,  for  all flights. (T-1) 5.4.4.2.  The PNF normally makes all air traffic control (ATC) radio calls. 5.4.4.3.  A  designated  crewmember  will  monitor  the  primary  command  radio  unless directed otherwise, during all phases of flight. (T-2) 20 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 5.4.4.4.  A  flight  deck  crewmember  will  monitor  guard  regardless  of  the  primary  radio. (T-2) 5.4.5.  Datalink, SATCOM voice, and Airline Operational Control (AOC). 5.4.5.1.  The PNF and/or navigator normally accomplish all datalink correspondence with ATC. Verify the content and accuracy of all downlinks with the other pilot or navigator prior to sending a downlink to ATC. 5.4.5.2.  Prior to sending any ATC downlink report containing aircraft position, altitude, altitude climbing/descending to, airspeed, or routing information, the PNF will coordinate with the navigator to ensure the Flight Management System (FMS) is providing accurate information for the report. (T-2) 5.4.5.3.  The navigator (or PNF) normally monitors, replies to, and initiates all SATCOM voice, AOC, and Air Traffic System datalink communications. 5.4.6.  HF Communications. Perform HF radio ground checks prior to takeoff when HF radio use may be required for ATC or C2 communications. 5.5.  Runway, Taxiway, and Airfield Requirements. 5.5.1.  Runway. The minimum required runway length and width is 7000 feet by 147 feet. 5.5.1.1.  Intersection Takeoffs. Normally, takeoffs should be initiated from the beginning of  the  approved  usable  portion  of  the  runway.  However,  pilots  may  accomplish intersection  takeoffs  provided  the  aircraft  gross  weight,  takeoff  obstructions,  weather, runway  condition,  etc,  allows  for  a  safe  takeoff  and  departure.  The  decision  to  make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the AC. 5.5.1.2.  Contaminated  Runways.  During  operations  on  runways  partially  covered  with snow or ice, base takeoff computations on the reported Runway Surface Condition (RSC) or Runway Condition Reading (RCR) for the cleared portion of the runway. A minimum of  50  feet  either  side  of  centerline  should  be  cleared.  If  the  runway  cannot  be  cleared, compute  takeoff  data  based  on  the  un-cleared  portion  up  to  50  feet  either  side  of centerline. 5.5.1.3.  Use  of  Overruns.  If  approach  end  overruns  are  available  and  stressed  or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for takeoff. Departure end overruns may also be used for landing (as needed) if stressed and authorized. 5.5.1.4.  RCR  Limitations.  Minimum  RCR  for  takeoff  and  landing  is  the  lowest  RCR depicted in the T.O. 1E-4B-1-1 (never less than 4). When no RCR is reported, aircrews should consider the runway wet when there is sufficient water on the surface to cause a reflective glare or when rain is falling. 5.5.2.  Taxiways. Minimum required taxiway width is 74 feet. 5.5.2.1.  RCR Limitations. Aircrews will not taxi on surfaces where the reported RCR is less than 4 without approval from the 55OG/CC, or the NAOC OTC on off-station HHQ missions.  (T-0)  Aircrews  should  use  caution  during  periods  of  degraded  RCR  since taxiways and ramps may have an even lower RCR than reported for the runway. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 21 5.6.  Wind  Limitations.  Airfields  are  considered  below  minimums  for  takeoff  and  landing when winds (including gusts) are greater than: 5.6.1.  Maximum wind (any direction) – 50 knots. 5.6.2.  Tailwind – 10 knots. 5.6.3.  Crosswind – 30 knots, uncorrected for RCR. 5.7.  Aircraft Taxi Speeds.  Aircraft taxi speeds should be limited to 10 knots during turns of 90 degrees  or  more  and  30  knots  when  taxiing  straight  ahead.  Aircrews  should  adjust  speeds accordingly for turns between 0 and 90 degrees. 5.8.  Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria and Foreign Object Damage Avoidance. 5.8.1.  Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 feet of obstructions without wing walkers. With wing walkers,  avoid  obstructions  by  at  least  10  feet.  Use  extreme  caution  when  scanning  from inside  the  airplane  since  wing  tip  and  tail  growth  in  turns  make  determination  of  actual clearance  very  difficult.  EXCEPTION:  IAW  AFI  11-218,  Aircraft  Operations  and Movement  on  the  Ground,  aircraft  may  taxi  without  marshallers/wing  walkers  at  home station  along  fixed  taxi  lines  which  have  been  measured  to  ensure  a  minimum  of  10  feet clearance from any permanent obstacles. 5.9.  Seat Belt/No-Smoking Sign Policy. 5.9.1.  To enhance “Seat Belt” sign credibility and compliance, the flight crew turns the sign on just prior to taxi and off just after the parking brake has been set for parking. The flight crew  will  also  turn  on  the  seat  belt  sign  during  air  refueling,  anytime  the  landing  gear  is extended, and at the discretion of the AC. (T-2) 5.9.2.  In order to comply with AFI 11-202V3 guidance, the “No Smoking” sign policy and the use of portable electronic devices on E-4B aircraft is as follows: 5.9.2.1.  The flight  crew will turn on the “No Smoking” sign prior to  engine start and it will remain illuminated anytime the aircraft is operating below 10,000 feet MSL.  (T-2) Prior to takeoff, the FA will make a PA announcement directing all personnel to turn off, or  set  to  airplane  mode,  and  stow  all  non-approved  portable  electronic  devices  and cellular phones. (T-2) 5.9.2.2.  When  the  aircraft  descends  through  10,000  feet  MSL  and  the  “No  Smoking” light  illuminates,  the  FA  will  make  a  PA  announcement  directing  all  personnel  to  turn off, or set to airplane mode, and stow all non-approved portable electronic devices. (T-2) 5.9.2.3.  Anytime in flight when the “No Smoking” sign is illuminated, all personnel will turn  off  and  stow  all  non-approved  portable  electronic  devices.  (T-2)  EXCEPTION: During air refueling, portable electronic devices may be used above 10,000 AGL with the “No Smoking” sign illuminated unless otherwise directed. 5.10.  Aircraft Door Operations. 5.10.1.  The  flight  crew  will  not  conduct  taxi  operations  with  a  cargo  door  or  hatch  open. EXCEPTION: EWO operations. 22 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 5.10.2.  Door operators will be selected from qualified personnel and assigned a specific door by  their  section  supervisor.    (T-2)  Table  5.1  specifies  E-4B  door  assignments  by  section. Personnel assigned duties as a door operator will: 5.10.2.1.  Complete  the E-4B  emergency  egress  training  before  being  designated  a  door operator. (T-2) 5.10.2.2.  Identify doors  armed in the  automatic  mode of operation  with  the appropriate flag. (T-2) 5.10.2.3.  Utilize  the  “buddy  system”  when  opening  any  of  the  main  deck  doors  except during actual emergency egress situations. (T-2) 5.10.2.4.  Immediately inform the FA of any problems arming/disarming any door. (T-2) Table 5.1.  Aircraft Door Assignments. Door Section 1 Left, 1 Right 2 Left, 2 Right 3 Left, 3 Right 4 Right 5 Left, 5 Right Flight Attendant Battlestaff Battlestaff Communications Communications 5.11.  Maximum Number of Personnel Aboard Aircraft. 5.11.1.  Normal.  Unless  directed  otherwise  by  the  JCS  or  HQ/ACC  and  approved  by ACC/A3,  the  AC  will  not  exceed  the  maximum  number  of  personnel  using  a  standard configuration (111 aircrew and passengers). (T-2) 5.11.2.  Emergency. The emergency authorization is for planning purposes and the AC must consult it in the event of emergency evacuation. (T-2) In this situation, the maximum number of  personnel  (aircrew  and  passengers)  is  330  with  a  standard  configuration.  However,  the passenger load may be varied depending on the urgency of the evacuation, the distance to be flown,  and  the  overall  condition  of  the  aircraft.  Weight  and  space  limitations  for  survival equipment and personal baggage are not considered in these numbers. 5.12.  Communication Systems Hazard Area Procedures. 5.12.1.  Do  not  open  the  flight  deck  escape  hatch  when  SHF/UHF  SATCOM  and/or MILSTAR are in use. (T-2) 5.12.2.  At no time will maintenance (MX) personnel enter an area level with or higher than the blue line on the fuselage without first verifying with communications personnel that the SHF/UHF SATCOM, INMARSAT and MILSTAR systems are operating in receive only, not operating,  or  are  pointed  at  an  angle  not  to  interfere  with  planned  maintenance.  (T-2)  This area includes walking on the wings outboard of the inboard engines. 5.12.3.  The SHF SATCOM antenna should not normally be operated below an angle of +10 degrees. If operation below +10 degrees is necessary, the SHF operator will coordinate with maintenance  to  ensure  personnel  are  outside  the  hazard  distance  associated  with  the  power output. (T-2) AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 23 5.12.4.  MILSTAR  operators  should  not  normally  transmit  below  an  angle  of  +5  degrees from the horizon. If operation below +5 degrees is necessary, operators will coordinate with maintenance  to  ensure  personnel  are  outside  the  hazard  distance  of  217  feet.  (T-2)  This restriction includes personnel in and around surrounding aircraft. 5.12.5.  The HF radio may be transmitting anytime the aircraft is on alert. Crewmembers will take precautions to avoid contact with the aircraft surfaces when the HF radio is transmitting. (T-2) 5.13.  Aircraft  Electrical  Power  Transfers.  With  mission  equipment  operating,  all  power transfers for the mission busses will be via Non Interruption of Power Supply (NIPS). (T-2) If a NIPS  transfer  cannot  be  made,  coordinate  with  Technical  Control  prior  to  any  switching  or restoring of electrical power. Power transfer is extremely critical and the must be done properly to  avoid  mission  equipment  damage.  (T-2)  If  power  transfers  cannot  be  made  via  NIPS,  FEs and/or maintenance personnel will ensure that Technical Control has ample time to power down critical equipment prior to any electrical  configuration changes. (T-2) Clearly communicate the power needs of the aircraft to the ground crew. 5.14.  Fuel Jettison Procedures. 5.14.1.  Aircrews  should  burn  down  fuel  versus  jettison  unless  safety  of  flight  dictates. Except  in  emergencies,  notify  ATC  or  a  flight  service  facility  of  intentions,  altitude,  and location  prior  to  jettison.  If  available,  aircrews  should  use  designated  jettison  areas  except when  safety  of  flight  would  be  compromised.  Never  jettison  fuel  in  a  circular  descending pattern. 5.14.2.  For NAOC and HHQ missions, the OTC may authorize fuel jettison when an urgent operational  requirement  dictates  immediate  recovery/reconstitution  of  the  aircraft  and/or aircrew  (alert  force  exercises  are  not  considered  urgent).  The  55  OG/CC  may  also  approve fuel jettison for training missions when an urgent operational requirement exists to expedite recovery of the aircraft and all alternatives have been exhausted. 5.15.  Bird/Wildlife  Aircraft  Strike  Hazard  (BASH)  Program.  BASH  programs  are centralized  unit  efforts  that  provide  information  cross-feed,  hazard  identification,  and  a consolidated course of action. Aircrews will comply with guidance found in 55 WG BASH Plan 91-212. On operational NAOC missions the OTC is the BASH waiver authority. (T-3) 5.16.  Participation  in  Aerial  Events.  See  AFI  11-209,  Aerial  Event  Policy  and  Procedures, and the appropriate ACC supplement. The 55 OG/CC must ensure aerial events  are sanctioned and individually approved by the appropriate military authority and the FAA.

Briefing Requirements. 6.9.1.  Aircraft Commander Briefing. Cover all applicable items on the 55th Wing-approved Briefing Certificate to ensure safe and effective mission accomplishment. Items expanded on in the standards guide and understood by all participants may be briefed as “standard.”  All flight  crew  members  will  attend  this  briefing  unless  excused  by  the  AC.  (T-3)  The AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 27 communications  team  Flight  Commander  and  NCOIC  (or  their  representatives)  will  also attend (as applicable) and back-brief team members on all pertinent items. (T-3) If more than 72 hours have elapsed between the initial brief and scheduled takeoff, the AC shall re-brief any items deemed critical for safe mission accomplishment. (T-3) 6.9.2.  Pre-Alert  (NAOC  4-Hour)  Briefing.  All  Flight  crew  members  should  attend  if possible. As a minimum, the AC and the CCO will attend a NAOC pre-alert briefing. (T-2) If,  due  to  mission  requirements,  the  AC  and/or  CCO  are  unable  to  attend,  a  designated representative will be sent who will brief the on-coming crew prior to assuming alert. (T-2) The AC and CCO will, in-turn, brief all remaining crewmembers. (T-3) 6.9.3.  Pre-Deployment  Briefing.  The  NAOC/CC  and/or  1  ACCS/CC  (or  designated representative) will conduct specialized briefings for aircrews deploying on PSMs/SSMs. (T-0) This briefing is used to advise aircrews of the latest mission changes, deployment issues, intelligence  situation,  and  review  other  applicable  information.  All  primary  and  alternate crewmembers should attend the briefing. The DO or AC may exempt crewmembers from this briefing on a case-by-case basis. If excused, crewmembers will be back briefed by the AC or section head before deployment. (T-3) 6.9.4.  Weather Briefings. 6.9.4.1.  Home Station Departures. Weather briefings may be faxed, emailed or posted on the  Offutt  weather  website,  as  requested  by  the  aircrew.  When  faxing  weather  request, aircrews  will  call  to  verify  receipt,  clarify  any  questions  they  have,  and  receive  any critical updates that may arise. (T-2) Verbal briefings are authorized for flights. 6.9.4.2.  En  Route  Stops.  Aircrews  should  obtain  weather  information  from  the  local military weather flight, Offutt AFB weather flight, or the Operational Weather Squadron (OWS)  responsible  for  weather  support  at  their  location.  If  adequate  services  are  not available  and  the  crew  cannot  contact  their  home  station  weather  flight,  obtain  weather through an OWS or MAJCOM-approved source in accordance with AFI 11-202V3. 6.9.4.3.  NAOC Controlled Missions. Weather products and services will be provided or arranged  for  by  the  supporting  AF  organization  according  to  AFI  11-202V3,  AFH 11203V2, Weather for Aircrews, Products and Services and the DoD Flight Information Handbook (FIH). 6.10.  Flight  Plan  Verification.  Computer  Flight  Plans  (CFP)  are  the  official  source  of performance,  navigation,  and  climatic  data,  including  enroute  wind  information.  Each  mission segment should use the best wind data available. 6.10.1.  Verify CFPs for route of flight and fuel computation accuracy before departure. CFP wind data should be considered inaccurate if the average wind for a route segment exceeds either 30 degrees in direction or 25 knots in speed from forecast conditions. 6.10.2.  As a minimum, the Navigator will optimize CFPs for winds and include the route of flight, headings and airspeeds, winds, enroute times, air refueling information, and fuel log. (T-2)  Best  range  airspeed  should  be  used  for  general  flight  planning  unless  mission requirements dictate otherwise. 6.11.  Jeppesen  Flight  Planning  Procedures.  Jeppesen Dispatch services will only be utilized on HHQ missions. (T-2)  Jeppesen Milplanner may be used for any sortie. 28 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 6.12.  Departure Planning.  Comply with T.O. 1E-4B-1-1, AFI 11-202V3, AFMAN 11-217V1; Instrument Flight Procedures, and this chapter for departure planning. Regardless of the type of departure  flown,  review  the  following  (as  appropriate):  IFR  Departure  Procedures,  Standard Instrument  Departure  (SID),  instrument  approach  plates,  NOTAMS,  Global  Decision  Support System (GDSS) Giant Report (if available), and suitable terrain charts including obstacles. Pilots and Flight Engineers will check IFR SIDS at all departure and destination airfields to ensure that all  published  climb  gradients  can  be  met  for  forecast  weather  conditions.  (T-0)  Crews  will  be trained and certified prior to flying Special Departure Procedures (SDP). (T-0) 6.13.  Weather Minimums for Takeoff. 6.13.1.  Departures  with  weather  below  landing  minimums  are  authorized  IAW  AFI  11-202V3,  chapter  4.  When  weather  is  below  approach  and  landing  minimums  (ceiling  and visibility), a departure alternate is required (see paragraph  6.14). 6.13.2.  RVR  Requirements.  For  NAOC  operational  missions,  the  NAOC  Team  Chief  may waive  takeoff  RVR  down  to  1000  ft  (300  M).  For  Special  Airlift  Missions  (SAM),  takeoff RVR  is  1000  ft  (300  M).    Minimum  takeoff  RVR  for  all  other  sorties  is  1600  ft.    NOTE: Aircrews will comply with AFI 11-202V3 basic requirements when RVR is below 1600 ft. 6.14.  Departure Alternates. 6.14.1.  A  departure  alternate  is  required  if  ceiling  or  visibility  is  below  landing  minimums for  an  available  approach  (at  departure  aerodrome).  Do  not  use  CAT  II/III  Instrument Landing System (ILS) minimums to determine if a departure alternate is required. 6.14.2.  When a departure alternate is required, the AC will ensure the aircraft is capable of maintaining  the  Minimum  Enroute  Altitude  (MEA)  or  minimum  obstruction  clearance altitude (MOCA), whichever is higher, to the alternate using One Engine Inoperative (OEI) performance criteria. (T-2) 6.14.3.  Suitability. 6.14.3.1.  To qualify as a departure alternate, the selected airfield must be  within 1 hour flying time at cruising speed. The existing weather (takeoff time) at the alternate must be at  least  500-1  above  the  lowest  compatible  published  approach  minimums,  but  not  less than 600-2 for a precision approach or 800-2 for a non-precision approach, and forecast to remain so for 1 hour after Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) at the alternate. 6.15.  Destination  Requirements  (for  filing  purposes).  The  forecast  destination  weather  will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 and the following: 6.15.1.  Destination Weather  Below Minimums.  On operational  missions, aircrews may file to  a  destination  airport  which  is  forecast  to  be  below  the  lowest  published  approach minimums provided they comply with the guidance in paragraph 6.15.2. 6.15.2.  File two alternates when: 6.15.2.1.  The forecast visibility (intermittent or prevailing) is less than published for an available DoD or National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) precision approach; or 6.15.2.2.  The  forecast  ceiling  or  visibility  (intermittent  or  prevailing)  is  less  than published for all other approaches. For approaches with no published ceiling requirement (e.g.  Jeppesen  approaches),  the  minimum  required  ceiling  shall  be  computed  by  taking AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 29 the  published  HAA  or  HAT  and  rounding  it  up  to  the  nearest  one  hundred  feet  (or  as determined by MAJCOM Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPs) review). (T-2) 6.15.2.3.  The forecast surface winds to include gusts (intermittent or prevailing) exceed limits corrected for RCR. 6.15.2.4.  When  filing  two  alternates,  both  must  be  at  least  45  nm  apart,  have  an operational and compatible precision approach, and meet the criteria for alternate airport weather  outlined  in  AFI  11-202V3,  Chapter  4.  Include  fuel  for  an  approach,  missed approach, and divert to the most distant alternate in the total flight plan fuel. (T-2) 6.15.3.  File  an  alternate,  regardless  of  forecast  weather,  when  the  destination  aerodrome  is outside the 48 conterminous states. EXCEPTION: OCONUS, intra-theater flights that do not exceed 3-hours, comply with basic AFI 11-202V3. 6.15.4.  Remote or Island Destination. When filing to a remote or island destination, aircrews will  use  1+15  holding  fuel  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  (plus  45  minutes  reserve  fuel).  (T-2)  A remote or island destination is defined as any aerodrome which, due to its unique geographic location,  offers  no  suitable  alternate  (civil  or  military)  within  2  hours  flying  time.  The forecast weather at the remote or island destination must meet the following criteria: 6.15.4.1.  The  prevailing  surface  winds,  to  included  gusts,  corrected  for  RCR,  must  be within limits at ETA and forecast to remain so for 2 hours thereafter. (T-2) 6.15.4.2.  The prevailing ceiling and visibility must be equal to or greater than published minimums  for  an  available  non-precision  approach  [excluding  Approach  Surveillance Radar (ASR)], for ETA plus 2 hours. (T-2) However, if a precision approach is available, the  ceiling  or  visibility  may  be  intermittently  below  non-precision  approach  minimums (excluding  ASR),  but  not  below  precision  approach  minimums  (for  ETA  plus  2  hours). NOTE:  See  paragraph    14.3.3  of  this  AFI  for  fuel  planning  considerations  for destination requirements. 6.16.  Adverse Weather. 6.16.1.  Turbulence. 6.16.1.1.  Do  not  fly  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  turbulence.    Additionally, avoid areas of known or forecast moderate or greater mountain wave turbulence. 6.16.1.2.  Crews should confirm the type of aircraft the forecast turbulence applies to, or what  type  of  aircraft  reported  the  encounter,  to  gain  a  more  accurate  picture  for  their route of flight. The E-4B is a category II aircraft for turbulence. 6.16.2.  Icing. 6.16.2.1.  Do not  fly into areas of forecast  or reported severe icing.  If moderate icing is encountered, every effort will be made to exit the icing conditions. 6.16.2.2.  Do  not  takeoff  under  conditions  of  freezing  rain.  Do  not  takeoff  under conditions of freezing drizzle/fog except when the aircraft has been properly de-iced/anti-iced with approved commercial fluids  IAW applicable aircraft T.O. procedures.  NOTE: technical  note  AFWA/TN  98/002,  Meteorological Air  Force  Weather  Agency Techniques, states that freezing drizzle is equivalent to moderate clear icing and freezing rain is equivalent to severe clear icing. 30 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 6.16.2.3.  Freezing precipitation, snow, freezing fog, or temperatures near 0oC may cause ice  or  frost  to  accumulate  on  aircraft  surfaces.  When  the  aircraft  requires  de-icing/anti-icing prior to takeoff refer to the 1E-4B(II)-1 and the following guidance: 6.16.2.4.  In all cases, a visual inspection of the aircraft will be made within 5 minutes of takeoff.  (T-2) Aircrews can assume that the condition of the horizontal stabilizer is the same as the wing provided a visual inspection of the entire aircraft is made just prior to taxi. 6.16.2.5.  Aircrews may utilize FAA/AFFSA published holdover times when the aircraft is de-iced with other than Type I de-icing fluids. 6.16.3.  Thunderstorm Avoidance. 6.16.3.1.  To minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards when approaching or departing airports  in  areas of convective  activity, aircrews  will maintain at  least  5  NM separation from heavy rain showers. (T-2) Aircrews can further minimize exposure to thunderstorm hazards  by  attempting  to  maintain  VMC  and  avoiding  areas  of  high  lightning  potential (clouds within + 5,000 feet of the freezing level or + 8oC of the freezing level). 6.16.3.2.  Aircrews  should  avoid  flying  in  areas  of  recently  dissipated  thunderstorms, advected  clouds  (horizontal  movement  of  clouds  caused  by  wind)  downwind  of thunderstorms, or underneath a thunderstorm’s anvil cloud. 6.16.3.3.  On operational missions, approaches or departures may be accomplished when thunderstorms  are  within  10NMs.  The  thunderstorms  must  not  be  producing  any hazardous conditions (such as hail, lightning, strong winds, gusts fronts, heavy rain, wind shear, or microburst) at the airport, and must not be forecast or observed to be moving in the  direction  of  the  route  of  flight  (to  include  the  planned  missed  approach  corridor,  if applicable). 6.16.3.4.  Alert  Missions.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  alert  aircraft  will  avoid ground alert at locations where severe thunderstorms are forecast. (T-3) Aircrews should consider  launching  when  severe  thunderstorms  are  observed  within  50  NM,  but  will launch without delay when thunderstorms are observed to be on course to the airfield. (T-2)  When  in  doubt,  ACs  should  err  to  the  conservative  side  and  launch  since thunderstorms develop quickly, with little or no warning in an unstable atmosphere, thus providing little to no window for safe escape. 6.16.3.5.  Consideration should be given to accomplish TRT takeoffs in areas where wind shear and thunderstorm activity is forecast. 6.17.  Risk  Management  (RM).  RM  is  a  logic-based,  common  sense  approach  to  making calculated  decisions  on  human,  material,  and  environmental  factors  that  impact  safe  mission accomplishment.  ACs  will  accomplish  the  1  ACCS-approved  RM  worksheet  during  preflight mission planning activities. (T-2) Section 6C—Preflight 6.18.  AFTO  Forms  781  Series.  Review  AFTO  Forms  781  series  before  performing  any preflight duties or checks. An authorized official must sign an Exceptional Release (ER) before flight. (T-2) A maintenance (MX) officer, superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 31 the  ER,  but  the  AC  may  sign  if  one  of  these  individuals  is  not  available.  Ensure  that  the  DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate and Air Card are aboard the aircraft. Verify a current MX dash-six inspection is completed and annotated on the AFTO form 781H. 6.19.  FMS  Flight  Plan  Accuracy.  Either a pilot or another navigator will verify all waypoint data  inserted  into  the  FMS  by  the  navigator.  Check  both  the  coordinate  information  and  the distances  between  waypoints  against  the  flight  plan.  This  information  will  also  be  checked against the IFR flight plan filed with ATC. 6.20.  Aircraft Servicing and Ground Operations. 6.20.1.  Refueling  and  De-fueling.  Qualified  FEs  are  authorized  to  refuel  or  de-fuel  the aircraft. Refer to Chapter 12 of this instruction for further guidance. 6.20.1.1.  Alert  Missions.  Standard  fuel  load  is  180,000  pounds  regardless  of  location. Fuel  loads  may  be  adjusted  as  mission  requirements  dictate  provided  the  change  is approved by the OTC and/or CCOC and aircraft performance factors allow it. 6.20.1.2.  Hot Refuel Procedures. Hot Refueling is authorized on alert missions with one or more engines operating. The AC and senior crew chief on duty will determine the need for  hot  refueling  and  ensure  that  all  operations  are  accomplished  in  a  safe  manner  and IAW applicable T.O. guidance. (T-3) 6.20.1.2.1.  Only  essential  personnel  are  authorized  on-board  the  aircraft  during  hot refueling.  All  NAOC  Operations  Team  (OT)  personnel  may  remain  with  their classified material on board the aircraft. 6.20.1.2.2.  Both the base and the refueling team must be certified and current. The 55 Maintenance Group Quality Assurance section maintains a list of certified and current bases. (T-2) 6.20.1.2.3.  Refueling will not begin until sufficient fire coverage is present. (T-2) If sufficient fire coverage cannot be maintained, hot refueling will be terminated. (T-2) Do not resume operations until sufficient fire coverage is restored. 6.20.2.  Potable Water. 6.20.2.1.  Operational Missions. Service 400 gallons of fresh potable water (4 full tanks). Drain and re-service water every 72 hours. 6.20.2.2.  Training  Sorties.  Service  a  minimum  of  200  gallons  of  fresh  potable  water when outside temperatures allow or as directed by the 1 ACCS/DO (for example, Trailing Wire Antenna (TWA) sorties). Drain and re-service water every 72 hours. 6.20.3.  Hot liquid oxygen (LOX) Servicing Procedures. Hot LOX servicing is authorized on alert  missions  with  one  or  more  engines  operating.  The  AC  and  senior  crew  chief  on  duty will  determine  the  need  for  hot  LOX  servicing  and  ensure  that  all  operations  are accomplished in a safe manner and IAW applicable T.O. guidance. (T-3) 6.20.3.1.  Only  essential  personnel  are  authorized  on-board  the  aircraft  during  hot  LOX servicing.  No  personnel  are  permitted  in  the  forward  lower  lobe.  All  NAOC  OT personnel may remain with their classified material on board the aircraft. 32 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 6.20.3.2.  Limit  maintenance  activities components inside the aircraft. to the  physical  replacement  of  avionics 6.20.3.3.  Hot LOX servicing will not begin until sufficient fire coverage is present. (T-2) If  sufficient  fire  coverage  cannot  be  maintained,  servicing  will  be  terminated.  (T-2)  Do not resume operations until sufficient fire coverage is restored. 6.20.4.  Tire  Rotation.  Although  a  72-hour  tire  rotation  is  not  mandated,  T.O.  4T-1-3, Inspection,  Maintenance  Instructions,  Storage  and  Disposition  of  Aircraft  Tires  and Tubes, recommends a three-day tire rotation cycle. If the aircraft has not been moved in several days and tire flat-spotting is suspected, the crew must perform sufficient taxiing to roll out tire flat spots prior to attempting a high-speed taxi and/or takeoff. (T-2) 6.20.5.  Non-Contract  Fuel.  In  limited  cases,  NAOC  operational  mission  requirements  may necessitate  the  use  of  an  airfield  where  no  contract  fixed  based  operator  (FBO)  exists.  In these cases, the use of non-contract fuel is approved. 6.21.  Life Support Requirements. 6.21.1.  Oxygen. Minimum liquid oxygen (LOX) quantity is 200 liters with 4 operable LOX converters  and  150  liters  with  3  operable  LOX  converters.  The  AC  may  authorize  lower amounts. 6.21.2.  Meals  Ready  to  Eat  (MREs).  Fifty  seven  cases  are  pre-positioned  aboard  the  alert aircraft. Section 6D—Departure 6.22.  On  Time  Takeoffs.  Mission departures are considered on time if the aircraft is  airborne within 30 minutes of scheduled takeoff time.  6.23.  Cabin Security Procedures for Takeoff and Landing.  The following procedures should be followed prior to all takeoffs and landings: 6.23.1.  The  FA  should  assure  all  carry-on  luggage  and  supplies  are  secured  as  soon  as possible after boarding personnel. Ensure all personal carry-on baggage is stowed to prevent a  hazard  during  emergency  landings.  Notify  the  AC  when  excessive  amounts  of  baggage preclude safe stowage. 6.23.2.  The FA will confirm the anticipated taxi time with the AC prior to commencing any cabin service before takeoff. (T-2) 6.23.3.  The FA will notify the cockpit crew that the cabin is secure prior to being seated for takeoff to include number of souls on board. (T-2) Section 6E—En Route 6.24.  Flight  Progress.  In-flight,  use  all  available  navigational  aids  to  monitor  Flight Management  System  (FMS)  performance.  Immediately  report  malfunctions  or  any  loss  of navigation capability that degrades centerline accuracy to the controlling air route traffic control center (ARTCC). Use the following procedures for flight progress: AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 33 6.24.1.  The  flight  crew  will  enter  Oceanic,  Trailing  Wire  Antenna,  air  refueling, communication  exercise,  and  Category  I  routes  into  an  approved  mission  planning  system and a display using a moving map.  (T-2) If a new route of flight is received, enter the new route of flight when able. When the approved mission planning system and/or moving map are  unavailable,  crews  will  use  an  appropriate  navigational  chart  to  plot  and  record  route data. (T-2) 6.24.2.  Another  pilot  or  navigator  will  verify  all  waypoint  data  inserted  into  the  Flight Management System. (T-2) 6.24.3.  When  approaching  each  waypoint  on  a  Category  I  or  over-water  route,  recheck coordinates for the next waypoint and crosscheck actual versus planned fuel remaining. 6.24.4.  Operations  in  Territorial  and  International  Airspace.  (See  FLIP,  FCG,  and  Area Planning (AP) for further guidance). 6.24.4.1.  Territorial  Airspace.  Includes  airspace  above  territorial  seas,  archipelagic waters,  inland  waters,  and  land  territory,  and  is  sovereign  airspace.  Consistent  with international  law,  the  US  recognizes  sea  claims  up  to  12  NMs,  however,  specific guidance from certain US authorities may establish limits which differ from this standard. Do  not  enter  the  territorial  airspace  of  another  nation  without  the  proper  diplomatic clearance. 6.24.4.2.  International  Airspace.  This  includes  all  airspace  seaward  of  coastal  states’ territorial seas. Military aircraft may operate in such areas free of interference or control by  the  coastal  state.  A  Flight  Information  Region  (FIR)  does  not  reflect  international borders  or  sovereign  airspace.  Aircraft  may  operate  within  an  established  FIR  without approval of the adjacent country, provided the AC avoids flight in territorial airspace. 6.24.4.3.  Aircrews  should  not  amend  diplomatically  approved  entry  point(s)  when  on  a flight plan route which takes them from international airspace into territorial airspace. 6.24.4.4.  In  the  event  an  ATC  agency  challenges  the  validity  of  a  flight  routing  or attempts to negate existing clearances, ACs must evaluate the circumstances. The normal response  is  to  advise  ATC  that  the  aircraft  is  continuing  to  the  planned  destination  as cleared in international airspace. The key phrase is "in international airspace." Safety of flight is paramount in determining mission continuation. 6.24.4.5.  Aircrews  should  not  normally  fly  "due  regard"  routings  unless  specifically required  by  the  mission  directives.  Operating  under  "due  regard"  obligates  ACs  to  be their own ATC agency and separate their aircraft from all other air traffic. If operational requirements dictate, ACs may exercise the "due regard" option to protect their aircraft. Comply  with  the  guidance  found  in  FLIP  General  Planning.  Aircraft  should  return  to normal air traffic services as soon as safety permits. 6.25.  Special Qualification Airspace. 6.25.1.  E-4B  aircraft  are  approved  for  operations  in  Required  Navigation  Performance (RNP)  airspace  down  to  RNP-0.3,  Required  Vertical  Separation  Minimum  (RVSM)  and Future Air Navigation Systems (FANS) airspace.  The E-4B is Stage-3 Noise Compliant. 34 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 Section 6F—Arrival 6.26.  Instrument Approach Procedures (IAPs). 6.26.1.  Weather. Prior to starting an instrument approach or beginning an en route descent, pilots will confirm that existing weather is reported to be at or above required minimums for the lowest compatible approach. 6.26.2.  Aircraft Category. The E-4B is designated a category D aircraft. Instrument approach RVR/visibility  and,  if  required,  ceiling  minimums  are  as  published  for  a  category  "D" aircraft.  If  the  approach  speed  will  exceed  165  knots,  the  minimums  for  category  "E"  are used. 6.26.3.  ILS Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) Approaches. Both pilots must be certified to conduct  ILS PRM approaches.  (T-0) The PIC must  comply with  the following operational procedures: (T-0) 6.26.3.1.  PIC will brief the approach as an ILS/PRM approach. (T-0) 6.26.3.2.  Two operational VHF communication radios are mandatory. 6.26.3.3.  All  breakouts  from  the  approach  will  be  hand  flown.  Pilots  will  disengage autopilots when a breakout is directed. (T-1) 6.26.3.4.  Should  a  Traffic  Collision  Avoidance  System  (TCAS)  Resolution  Advisory (RA)  be  received,  the  pilot  shall  immediately  respond  to  the  RA.  (T-0)  If  following  an RA  requires  deviating  from  an  ATC  clearance,  the  pilot  shall  advise  ATC  as  soon  as practical.  (T-0)  While  following  an  RA,  comply  with  the  turn  portion  of  the  ATC breakout instruction unless the pilot determines safety may be compromised by following ATC directions. 6.26.4.  ILS Cat  1. Category  1 minimums  will be as published on the  Instrument Approach Procedures (IAP). When authorization is stated on the IAP, Category 1 ILS approaches may be flown to minimums as low as 1800 RVR (feet). When TDZ/CL is not available and RVR is  below  2400  feet,  aircrews  will  fly  an  autopilot  coupled  approach  (single  channel)  until reaching the altitude at which the decision to land or go-around is made. 6.26.5.  ILS Cat II/IIIa Approaches. Multiple airfield/aircraft systems and equipment must be operational  for  Cat  II/IIIa  approaches.  Consult  AFM  11-217VI,  Instrument  Flight Procedures, T.O. E-4B(II)-1, and applicable AFIs for additional guidance. (T-2) 6.26.5.1.  Unless  circumstances  dictate  otherwise,  aircrews  should  comply  with  the following guidance to maximize aircraft performance during Cat II/IIIa approaches: 6.26.5.1.1.  Intercept localizer at an angle of 45 degrees or less. 6.26.5.1.2.  Intercept localizer not less than 8 miles from the runway threshold. 6.26.5.1.3.  Capture localizer at a speed of Vref + 40 knots or less. 6.26.5.1.4.  Capture glide slope at or above 1500 feet AGL. 6.26.5.1.5.  Stabilize  aircraft  on  localizer  and  glide  slope  not  later  than  the  outer marker or as soon as possible after passing the Final Approach Fix (FAF). AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 35 6.26.5.1.6.  Sterile  Approach  Path.  Advise  and  get  confirmation  from  ATC  that  you are flying a coupled and/or auto-land approach. 6.26.5.1.7.  Check  aileron  and  rudder  trim  prior  to  engaging  the  autopilot  for  the approach. 6.26.5.1.8.  Maintain symmetrical thrust on all four engines throughout the approach. Note:  If  any  of  these  conditions  cannot  be  met  and  weather  conditions  permit,  the pilot may elect to hand-fly a Cat II approach with three or four engines operating. 6.26.5.2.  “RA-NA” Minimums.  CAT II approaches without an RA setting for Decision Height  (DH)  are  authorized.  In  this  case,  the  terminology  “RA-NA”  is  annotated  in  the minimums section of the IAP. This denotes irregular terrain changes that affect RA. The PIC must determine DH solely from the barometric altimeter. 6.26.6.  ILS Cat IIIa. Minimums will be as published on the IAP, but no lower than 700 RVR (feet).  Accomplish a go-around if there is no visual reference with the touchdown zone by 50  feet  AGL  or  upon  receiving  a  report  of  controlling  RVR  below  minima  prior  to  this height. 6.26.6.1.  Weather  Below  Minimums.  If  an  aircrew  has  begun  the  en  route  descent  or published  approach  and  subsequently  determines  the  weather  is  below  approach minimums  (reported  or  observed),  the  pilots  must  not  deviate  from  the  last  ATC clearance  until  obtaining  a  new  or  amended  clearance.  CAT  I  approaches  may  be continued to the missed approach point and land, if the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing and the runway environment is in sight. (T-1) 6.27.  Border  Clearance/Customs.  Refer documentation and host nation procedures for border clearance/customs procedures. to  Foreign  Clearance  Guide,  DoD  FLIP 6.27.1.  Normal Operations: 6.27.1.1.  The 1 ACCS is normally responsible for border clearance of all aircraft. When staff support is not available, border clearance is the responsibility of the AC. 6.27.1.2.  The  AC  may  delegate  duties  to  ground  personnel  or  to  other  designated crewmembers,  but  he/she  retains  ultimate  responsibility.  The  AC  will  ensure  the following: 6.27.1.2.1.  Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas, when required. (T-0) 6.27.1.2.2.  Crew  members  and  passengers  possess  current  certificates  of immunization. (T-0) 6.27.1.2.3.  Depart  or  enter  the  United  States  through  an  air  base  where  border clearance can be obtained. (T-0) 6.27.1.2.4.  Obtain  border  clearance  for  aircraft  passengers,  crew  and  baggage,  if required, before takeoff to a foreign area or after arrival from a foreign area. (T-0) 6.27.2.  Procedures for US Entry: 6.27.2.1.  En  route,  the  FA  or  designated  crewmember  will  distribute  personal  customs declarations  to  all  passengers  and  crew  members.  (T-2)  The  FA  or  designated 36 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 crewmember  will  also  brief  passengers  and  crew  members  on  customs  regulations  and prepare and compile necessary border clearance forms for the FA’s signature. (T-2) 6.27.2.2.  En  route,  notify  the  C2  agency  or  airfield  contact  at  the  base  of  intended landing of any change in ETA to ensure that border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing. 6.27.2.3.  Obtain  a  permit  to  proceed  when  military  necessities  require  that  an  aircraft (which has landed in the United States for customs clearance) proceed to another base in the  US  to  obtain  border  clearance.  The  permit  to  proceed  delays  customs  inspection  of passengers  and  crew  until  arrival  at  the  off-load  station  and  saves  intermediate  off-loading and reloading normally required for customs inspection. The permit to proceed is valid only to the airport of next landing where the AC must ensure the border clearance is completed or a new permit to proceed issued by a customs official.  (T-0) Do not make intermediate stops between the issue point of the permit to proceed and destination unless required by an emergency situation or directed by the controlling authority. 6.27.2.4.  When an aircraft lands for a US border clearance, a US Customs representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents. Do not deplane passengers or  crew  members  unless  absolutely  necessary  for  safe  recovery  of  the  airplane  or  the preservation  of  life  and  property.  Do  not  unload  until  approved  by  customs  and agriculture  personnel  or  their  designated  representatives.  This  procedure  applies  to  the initial landing in the US and all landings required when operating on a permit to proceed or until all crew and passengers complete final border clearance. 6.27.3.  Inspections of E-4B aircraft by foreign officials: 6.27.3.1.  Follow  US  Air  Force  policy  on  status  of  military  aircraft  as  stated  in  the Foreign  Clearance  Guide,  General  Information,  Chapter  3.  In  substance,  this  policy states  that  US  military  aircraft  are  immune  from  searches,  seizures,  and  inspections (including customs and safety inspections) by foreign officials. In addition, ACs must be aware  of  and  adhere  to  any  specific  Foreign  Clearance  Guide  provisions  for  individual countries. (T-0) 6.27.3.2.  If confronted with a search request by foreign authorities, aircrews will follow the direction of the NAOC OTC.  (T-0) ACs should also consider the following guidance: 6.27.3.2.1.  In most cases, search attempts may be halted simply by a statement from the  AC  to  the  foreign  official  that  the  aircraft  is  a  sovereign  instrumentality  not subject to search without consent of US Air Force headquarters or the US Department of State officials in the country concerned. This should be clearly conveyed in a polite manner  so  as  not  to  offend  foreign  authorities  who  may  honestly,  but  mistakenly, believe they have authority to search US Air Force aircraft. 6.27.3.2.2.  If foreign  authorities insist  on conducting a search, the AC should  make every effort to delay the search until he or she can contact US Air Force headquarters or the appropriate embassy officials. The AC should then notify these agencies of the foreign request by the most expeditious means available and follow their instructions. 6.27.3.2.3.  If  foreign  officials  refuse  to  desist  in  their  search  request,  pending notification to US Air Force headquarters or the appropriate embassy, the AC should AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 37 indicate that he or she would prefer to fly the aircraft elsewhere (provided fuel, flying time, and mechanical considerations permit a safe flight) and request permission to do so. 6.27.3.2.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way  on  board  an  aircraft,  the  AC  should  state  that  he  protests  the  course  of  action being pursued and that he intends to  notify both  US  Air Force headquarters and the appropriate American Embassy of the foreign action. The aircraft commander should not  attempt  physical  resistance,  and  should  thereafter  report  the  incident  to  US  Air Force  headquarters  and  appropriate  embassy  as  soon  as  possible.  The  AC  should escort foreign authorities if the inspection cannot be avoided. 6.27.3.3.  Other  procedures  may  apply  when  carrying  sensitive  materials  or  equipment. Follow  these  procedures  and  applicable  portions  of  classified  Foreign  Clearance  Guide supplements. 6.27.4.  Payment of Services and Refusal of Fees: 6.27.4.1.  Consistent  with  U.S.  Government  policy,  DoD  aircraft  shall  not  be  subject  to air  navigation,  overflight,  or  similar  fees  for  transit  through  the  national  airspace  of another  country  or  through  Flight  Information  Regions  in  international  airspace.  DoD aircraft  shall  not  be  subject  to  landing  and  parking  fees  (or  other  use  fees)  at  foreign government  airports.  Reasonable  charges  for  services  requested  and  received  at  foreign airports shall be payable. 6.27.4.2.  If a foreign  government  insists on collecting a landing or parking fee, the AC should make every effort to delay the payment until he or she can contact US Air Force headquarters. 6.27.4.3.  If payment of a fee is demanded by the foreign government in order to depart, the AC may pay the fee “under protest” and shall notify the foreign government that he intends to notify both US Air Force headquarters and the appropriate American Embassy of the foreign action. 6.28.  Insect and Pest Control.  ACs will ensure required spraying is accomplished according to the FCG, or as directed by higher headquarters. (T-2) Certify the spraying on a CF 7507, or on forms  provided  by  the  country  transited.  Aircraft  should  never  be  sprayed  with  passengers  on-board. The only exception is when the FCG mandates it (for example, Australia). 6.28.1.  When spraying is conducted, use insecticide, aerosol d-phenothrin-2 percent, USAF approved or equivalent, to spray the aircraft. Use the following guidelines: 6.28.1.1.  Direct  the  nozzle  toward  the  ceiling  of  the  compartment  or  space  being sprayed. 6.28.1.2.  Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar spaces. 6.28.1.3.  Spray  the  cabin,  cockpit,  and  other  spaces  accessible  from  within  the  aircraft after  the  crew  is  aboard  and  after  closing  all  doors,  windows,  hatches,  and  ventilation openings.  CAUTION:  If  the  insecticide  label  requires  disembarkation  after  use,  spray 38 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 prior  to  boarding  crew  or  passengers.  Close  all  doors  and  hatches  for  10  minutes  after dispensing and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board. 6.28.2.  Spraying  Times.  Spray  the  aircraft  for  118  seconds  unless  longer  periods  are specified for the country being transited. 6.28.3.  Responsibility  of  Aircraft  Commander  In-flight.  When  seeing  any  insect  or  rodent infestation  of  the  aircraft  in-flight,  notify  the  destination  C2  facility,  base  operations,  or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft. 6.29.  Aircraft Recovery Away From Main Operating Base (MOB). 6.29.1.  When an aircraft is scheduled to land at a base other than home station, crew chiefs should accompany the aircrew.  In the absence of E-4B maintenance personnel (i.e. weather divert),  the  flight  crew  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  aircraft  is  turned  to  meet  subsequent mission taskings. 6.29.2.  In  all  cases  where  qualified  maintenance  specialist  assistance  is  not  available,  the flight crews will ensure compliance with the appropriate maintenance T.O. (T-2) 6.30.  Maintenance  Debrief.  Complete  the  AFTO  Form  781  series  after  each  flight.  After landing, crewmembers will debrief maintenance personnel on the condition of the aircraft. (T-2) 6.30.1.  ACs  or  Flight  Attendants  will  provide  one  copy  of  the  AFTO  Form  781,  ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Log to maintenance personnel. (T-2) 6.30.2.  Turn  in  Offutt  Form  791,  Aerial  Receiver  In-Flight  Receipt  Log,  AF  Form  664, Aircraft Fuels Documentation Log, AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Status and Maintenance  Document,  AFTO  FORM  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work Document, and the Offutt Form 73, Engine Condition Sheet, to the maintenance debriefer. Section 6G—Miscellaneous 6.31.  Engine Maintenance Runs.  Aircrews are authorized to perform engine maintenance runs which cannot be performed on the Echo Row and/or by maintenance personnel. When an aircrew is needed, the following procedures apply: 6.31.1.  AMU should notify 1 ACCS/DO no later than 14 hours prior to the scheduled engine run time. This provides 2 hours to organize a crew and 12 hours for pre-mission crew rest. A minimum of two pilots and one engineer are required for all engine runs. (T-2) 6.31.2.  Maintenance  personnel  will  accomplish  all  necessary  inspections  and  preparations for the engine run prior to crew show time and document the AFTO 781 series appropriately. (T-2) 6.31.3.  Engine run crews will comply with the following guidance: (T-2) 6.31.3.1.  Prior  to  departing  for  the  aircraft,  notify  command  post,  SOF,  Maintenance Operations Center (MOC) and base operations about the engine run. CP, in turn, notifies Central  Security  Control  (CSC).  Aircrews  pre-coordinate  with  the  control  tower  if runway use is required. 6.31.3.2.  Verify all engine run parameters/requirements (type of run, power settings, etc) with the maintenance supervisor prior to starting engines. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 39 6.31.3.3.  Follow  normal  aircrew  checklist  procedures.  Flaps  will  be  set  to  the  UP position. (T-2) 6.31.3.4.  Power  Settings  Above  Ground  Idle.  Operate  symmetrical  engines  with  the parking  brake  set  for  all  power  settings  above  ground  idle.  For  engine  runs  at  or  above the  takeoff  power  range,  aircrews  may  open  the  AURAL  WARN  circuit  breaker  to eliminate  nuisance  warnings.  When  opened,  crews  should  pay  special  attention  to  all visual  warning  indications  for  the  engine  and  APU.  Delay  opening  the  circuit  breaker until just prior to commencing the engine run and close it immediately upon completion. 6.31.3.5.  Terminate engine run at the first indication that damage to the aircraft or base equipment may occur. 6.31.4.  Military  Power  Assurance  (MPA)  Runs.  Engine  runs  are  normally  accomplished  at MPA  settings  with  no  bleed  air  or  electrical  loads  on  the  associated  engine.  These  runs normally use an N2 power setting instead of N1. MPA runs may be performed on any Echo Row parking spot up to maximum power. 6.31.5.  Takeoff  Rated  Thrust  (TRT)  Runs.  TRT  runs  are  only  accomplished  on  the  active runway.  When  runway  use  is  necessary,  engine  runs  should  be  de-conflicted  with  the  local flying schedule. Position the airplane into the wind (as best as possible) at approximately the mid-field position. 6.31.6.  If the aircraft is not ready 4 hours after show time, the crew is released. 6.32.  Life Support Equipment.  The Flight Attendant or the AC designated representative will: 6.32.1.  Ensure  appropriate  serviceable  protective  clothing,  life  support,  and  survival equipment for the entire mission is aboard the aircraft before departing home station. (T-2) 6.32.2.  Review,  sign,  and  date  the  AFTO  46,  Prepositioned  Life  Support  Equipment,  to ensure  all  required  protective  clothing  and  life  support  and  survival  equipment  have  been certified  as  installed  by  aircrew  life  support.  (T-2)  The  FA  will  ensure  appropriate  number and  type  of  life  preservers  are  aboard  for  over-water  missions  if  carrying  children  and/or infants. (T-2) 6.32.3.  Equipment Discrepancies. Aircrews discovering defective or missing equipment will document  the  discrepancy  in  the  AFTO  781A.  (T-2)  Normally,  do  not  sign  the  AFTO  46 until  the  discrepancy  has  been  corrected.  If  the  mission  continues  without  the  missing equipment, annotate the discrepancy on the AFTO 46 when signing and dating the form. 6.32.4.  Additional  Equipment.  If more equipment  is  discovered during the preflight  than is annotated on the AFTO 46, notify the maintenance supervisor. Extra equipment is normally stored  in  the  main  deck  Technical  Control/Rest  Area  overhead  compartment.  Excess equipment  should  be  removed  by  life  support  personnel  during  the  next  life  support inspection. 40 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance on aircraft security and preventing  and resisting hijacking  of  E-4B  aircraft.  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft  Piracy  (Hijacking), AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense,  and  specific  ACC  security  publications  contain  additional guidance. Aircrews will not release information concerning hijacking attempts or identify armed aircrew members or missions to the public. (T-2) 7.2.  Security.  All E-4B alert aircraft are Protection Level (PL) 1 resources. All other E-4Bs are PL 2 resources. Aircraft security at non-United States military installations is the responsibility of the controlling agency. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 41 Chapter 8 OPERATIONAL REPORTS AND FORMS 8.1.  General.  Applicable  reports  and  forms  are  contained  in  this  chapter.  Specific  reports  and forms applicable only to the flight engineer are in Chapter 12. 8.2.  AF FORM 457, USAF Hazard Report.  The AF FORM 457 is a tool to notify supervisors and commanders of a hazardous condition that requires prompt corrective action. For hazardous weather, complete the front side of an AF FORM 457 and send it to the parent wing flying safety office. 8.3.  AF FORM 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR).  The AF FORM 657 is a tool to report  near  midair  collisions  and  alleged  hazardous  air  traffic  conditions.  See  Attachment  3  of AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap  Prevention  Program,  for  more  information  concerning the HATR program. 8.3.1.

Human factors related situations. 8.4.1.13.  All cases of departure from intended takeoff or landing surface onto a surface not designed to normally support takeoff or landing loads. 8.4.1.14.  All in-flight fires regardless of damage. 8.4.1.15.  All bird strikes, regardless of damage. 8.4.1.16.  Any dropped object. 8.4.1.17.  Any  occurrence  which  does  not  meet  the  established  criteria  for  a  reportable mishap,  but  in  the  judgment  of  the  reporting  individual,  needs  to  be  emphasized  in  the interest of mishap prevention. 8.4.2.  Report mishaps as soon as possible to the 1 ACCS/DO and as directed on the OAFB 3404.  When  transiting  en  route  USAF  bases,  ACs  should  contact  the  local  Flight  Safety office  to  comply  with  local  reporting  requirements  and  seek  any  additional  assistance required.  Retain  a  copy  of  all  relevant  information,  and  turn  it  into  the  home  station  safety officer upon mission completion. 8.4.3.  Required  Information.  Complete  all  appropriate  areas  of  the  form.  Provide  as  much detail as possible. 8.5.  Report  Violations,  Unusual  Events,  or  Circumstances.  ACs shall document events that require them to deviate from AFI 11-202V3 (unless waived by competent authority) or alleged navigation  errors  (include  over-water  position  errors  over  24NMs,  border,  or  ATC  violations). (T-2) 8.5.1.  Use OPREP-3 reporting procedures contained in AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting, 8.5.1.1.  When  notified  of  a  navigation  position  error,  the  AC  (or  agency  that  receives initial  notification)  shall  document  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  incident  (using report format below) and ensure C2 agents submit an OPREP-3. (T-2) 8.5.2.  ACs shall expeditiously report unusual events/circumstances that impact their mission to appropriate ACC agencies. (T-2) Most events require C2 agents to forward OPREP reports to higher headquarters. In all cases, pass the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the incident to the appropriate C2 agency. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 43 Chapter 9 TRAINING POLICY 9.1.  Touch-and-Go Landings.  The following limitations apply: 9.1.1.  Comply with all flight manual procedures and restrictions. 9.1.2.  Runway. 9.1.2.1.  Minimum runway length is 8,000 feet.  9.1.2.2.  RCR shall be 15 or greater. (T-3) 9.1.2.3.  Do  not  accomplish  touch-and-go  landings  on  slush,  ice,  or  snow  covered runways.  EXCEPTION:  When  conditions  are  “patchy”  (ice  or  snow),  touch-and-go landings may be accomplished provided RCR is 9 or greater and minimum runway length is 9,000 feet. 9.1.3.  Maximum crosswind component is 20 knots. 9.1.4.  Accomplish all touch-and-goes under the direct supervision of an IP/EP in one of the pilot  seats.  There  is  NO  limitation  on  accomplishing  touch-and-go  landings  while  MEP  or passengers  are  onboard.  No  emergency  procedures  may  be  accomplished  while  MEP  or passengers  are  onboard.  AFI  11-401  contains  other  restrictions  based  on  the  type  of  flight profile.  9.1.5.  Weather.  Must  be  at/above  minimums  for  the  lowest  compatible  approach,  but  no lower than 200 foot ceiling / 2400 RVR (1/2 mi when RVR is not reported). (T-3) 9.2.  Short-Field  Landings  &  LPVRs.  When  conducting  practice  short-field  landings  and LPVRs, aircrew will comply with local guidance defined in the 1 ACCS Standards Guide. (T-3) 9.3.  Full  Stop/Taxiback  Landing  Procedures.  Full  stop/taxiback  landings  are  authorized under the following conditions: 9.3.1.  Compute a brakes-on speed which requires the dissipation of less than 20M ft-lbs of brake  energy.  If  manual  braking  is  used,  the  runway  length  and  condition  should  allow withholding brake application until the computed brakes-on speed is reached and still permit a safe stop. 9.3.2.  Brake energy is cumulative (landing, taxi, possible abort on subsequent takeoff, etc). Compute  the  total  brake  energy  accumulation  possible.  Use  a  limit  of  50M  ft-lbs  for  this calculation. 9.3.3.  Brake Cooling. The landing gear remains down on the subsequent  takeoff. The crew will  not  perform  further  full  stop/taxibacks  until  the  required  brake  cooling  time  has  been observed and actual brake cooling is confirmed at the Flight Engineer (FE) station. (T-3) 9.3.4.  The crew should  carefully  consider the possibility of  exceeding the brakes’ stopping capability  during  a  high-speed  abort  on  the  subsequent  takeoff.  The  brakes  are  effective  to approximately 58M ft-lbs of brake energy. 9.3.5.  So long as flight crew maintain control of the aircraft, for the purpose of scheduling, a taxi-back is not considered an additional sortie and does not require Form 2407, nor does it 44 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 require a Maintenance Quick Turn Checklist  be accomplished. Taxi-backs need not  be pre-coordinated and may be performed to change aircrew or to have quick inspections following a suspected bird strike. (T-3) 9.4.  Simulated  In-Flight  Emergency  Procedures.  Simulated  emergency  procedures  are conducted  IAW  AFI  11-202V3  and  this  instruction.

(T-2)  48 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 11 NAVIGATION PROCEDURES 11.1.  General.  This chapter consolidates unique navigation procedures into one location. 11.2.  Mission Planning. 11.2.1.  The  AC  or  designated  representative  shall  verify  proposed  routes  and  flight altitudes/levels provide proper terrain clearance and meet FLIP and FCG requirements. (T-2) 11.2.2.  Flight Plan. Cross-check the CFP planned route against the route of flight entered on the  DD  175,  Military  Flight  Plan  or  DD  1801,  DOD  International  Flight  Plan,  and  the approved diplomatic clearance. 11.2.3.  Navigator Station. The navigator who prepares or accepts the flight plan will remain on  duty  at  the  navigator's  station  during  departure  and  briefs  the  relieving  navigator.  (T-3)The  navigator  ensures  all  required  fuel  computations  are  accurate  and  complete,  and,  in addition, will ensure ramp fuel load is compatible with mission requirements. (T-0) 11.3.  Flight  Charts.  Prior  to  flight,  navigators  will  plot  oceanic,  TWA,  air  refueling, communication exercise, and Category  I  routes on an appropriate navigational  chart.  (T-2)  If a new route of  flight  is  received,  record and plot the new route  of flight  on the chart when able. This  requirement  may  be  met  using  paper  charts  or  electronic  charts  produced  with  approved mission  planning  software.  If  electronic  charts  are  used  in  flight  and  become  unavailable, navigators will transition to paper charts. (T-2) Required symbology and chart annotations are in accordance with AFPAM 11-216, Air Navigation and the flight manual. 11.3.1.  Annotate the following information on the chart: 11.3.1.1.  Flight plan course depicting reporting points, names and/or coordinates. 11.3.1.2.  On A/R missions, plot the ARIP, ARCP, turn, and exit points. 11.3.1.3.  Restricted,  warning,  and  prohibited  airspace  located  within  50  NM  of  the intended  route  of  flight.  Note:  Special  use  airspace  need  not  be  annotated  on  the  chart when the appropriate FLIP enroute chart is used. 11.3.1.4.  Highest terrain and/or obstacle within 50 NM of the intended route of flight. 11.3.1.5.  Air  Defense  Identification  Zone  (ADIZ)  for  all  flights  conducted  off  airways which penetrate the ADIZ on the inbound leg. 11.3.2.  Multiple legs on the same chart are permissible when practical. 11.4.  Navigator Procedures. 11.4.1.  General  Procedures.  General  navigation  (fixing  requirements)  begins  upon completion  of  the  published  departure  or  when  cleared  off  SID/on  course  by  the  departure control  agency  and  ends  when  the  pilot  or  air  traffic  controller  assumes  navigation  to  the terminal facility. 11.4.2.  Navigation Log. The navigator is required to record flight information on an in-flight log  during  general  navigation  only  when  operating  with  degraded  automated  navigation systems. (T-2) ACC-approved or locally-produced forms are acceptable for use. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 49 11.4.2.1.  Obtain  a  position  at  either  the  planned  departure  point  or  the  final  level  off point not to exceed takeoff time plus 30 minutes. 11.4.2.2.  As  a  minimum,  record  position  time,  compass  or  true  heading,  true  airspeed, groundspeed,  and  drift  at  intervals  not  to  exceed  30  minutes.  Record  a  position  for unplanned turns of 20 degrees or more off compass heading. 11.4.2.3.  Terminate fixing requirements and record a position when one of the following occurs: arrival at the initial point of a Standard Terminal Arrival Route (STAR), arrival at a high Initial Approach Fix (IAF), or start of the enroute descent. 11.4.2.4.  Navigation  log  entries  are  not  required  for  minor  heading  changes,  ATC vectors, etc. In-flight information/fixing requirements are not applicable during departure, holding,  air  refueling  (rendezvous,  orbits  and  anchor  patterns),  weather  avoidance, airway/jet route navigation, trailing wire orbits, mission rendezvous, and upon initiation of penetration and approach. The navigator must monitor the position of the airplane, at all times using all available aids. (T-2) 11.4.2.5.  Log  entries  may  be  delayed,  postponed,  or  altered  due  to  operational requirements  or  restrictions,  unscheduled  rendezvous  or  anchor  air  refueling,  weather deviations requiring immediate action, or EMCON limitations. Pacing  is  vital  to  ensure navigation accuracy. During periods when log entries are not required, the navigator will use all available resources to verify and cross-check navigation systems. (T-2) 11.4.2.6.  Dead  Reckoning.  The  primary  means  of  navigation  is  dead  reckoning  (DR). DR  positions  may  be  manual  or  automatic.  Use  automatic  DR  to  the  maximum  extent possible. Manual DR is not required when at least one Inertial Navigation System (INS) or GPS is operating satisfactorily. 11.4.2.7.  Fixing. The primary method of  fixing is  the FMS. For normal  FMS operation (Actual  Navigation  Performance  [ANP]  is  less  than  the  RNP  for  the  airspace  being flown),  the  FMS  position  will  be  cross-checked  by  radio  aid  or  radar  (when  available) and the compass magnetic heading. (T-2) INS track or true heading will be cross-checked with the flight plan or manually computed data. (T-2)  11.4.3.  Training  Sorties.  Navigation  legs  should  be  planned  for  a  minimum  duration  of  30 minutes. Do not plan navigation legs (1) during departure, prior to level off and prior to the planned departure point, (2) during A/R or when within the trailing wire area, or (3) during arrival,  from  10  minutes  prior  to  the  planned  enroute  descent  point,  initial  position  of  a STAR, or high altitude IAF until landing. 11.5.  High Latitude Operations.  Operations when flying north of 70 degrees and south of 60 degrees  latitude  require  thorough  study  and  understanding  of  all  instrument  approach  and INS/FMS  procedures  as  well  as  heading  displays.  The  AC  will  decide  whether  headings  are magnetic  or  true  oriented  and  ensure  all  crewmembers  understand  what  type  heading  is  being displayed on the HSI. Consider provisions for conversion of heading systems from magnetic to true and contingency plans for INS failures. Refer to operations manuals for specific procedures. (T-3) 11.5.1.  Currently, the use of Polar Routes is not authorized. 11.5.2.  INS(s) Inoperative. Comply with FLIP and other applicable procedures. 50 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 11.5.3.  AR Rendezvous. Coordinate with the tanker to ensure a common heading reference is used. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 51 Chapter 12 FLIGHT ENGINEER (FE) PROCEDURES 12.1.  General.

All  qualified  FEs  will  have  a  working  knowledge  of  airplane-specific  refueling procedures.  (T-2)  Although  FEs  are  normally  not  required  to  refuel  the  aircraft,  they  are authorized  to  accomplish  these  duties  when  maintenance  personnel  are  not  available. EXCEPTION:  FEs  will  not  perform  Concurrent/Hot  Refueling,  De-fueling,  Multiple  Fuel Servicing, or Battery Power Only Refueling unless assisting a maintenance refueling team. 12.6.2.  Aircrews will only refuel in cases where maintenance support is not readily available and the mission would be delayed. (T-2) However, crewmembers may augment maintenance refueling teams as required. 52 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 12.6.3.  If ground support personnel are not available, the AC may designate other qualified crewmembers to assist the FE with refueling duties (safety/fire observer, etc). In these cases, the  FE  will  act  as  the  refueling  team  supervisor.  (T-2)  Other  crewmembers  will  be thoroughly briefed on their respective duties. (T-2) 12.6.4.

Procedures. The FE should remain at the FE station to control the refuel and monitor aircraft  power.  To  facilitate  a  smooth  refuel  operation,  the  FE  should  ground  the  aircraft, position and bond the stand, hook-up and bond the initial hose to the SPR, hook up headsets, and accomplish any other preparation details prior to refuel operations as appropriate. 12.6.6.  Unless environmental conditions dictate otherwise, the primary emergency exit is the air stairs. 12.6.7.  Transient  Alert  (TA)  Assistance.  TA  personnel  are  authorized  to  refuel  the  E-4B provided  they  have  the  proper  refueling  checklists.  The  FE  will  coordinate  the  refueling process and assist the refuel supervisor during the refuel. (T-2) 12.7.  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity  Program.  The  flight  engineer  will  complete  the  AFTO Form 141, Individual Aircraft Tracking Program (IATP) Flight Log, on every flight. (T-2) This form documents usage data for the E-4B. 12.7.1.  Use the instructions on the form. 12.7.2.  Turn in completed forms during the MX debrief. The E-4B Flight Log manager will check these forms. (T-2) The log manager will forward completed forms on a quarterly basis to OC-ALC/ENFOC, 7803 Arnold Street, Bldg 3, Suite 128, Tinker AFB, OK, 73145- 9145. (T-2) 12.8.  Engine  Condition  Sheet.  Engine  Condition  Sheet  program  data  becomes  a  permanent part of an aircraft engine's history. In order to track potential engine failure, make every effort to record engine performance data on the Offutt Form 73 (engine coupon)  or approved electronic versions for each sortie. Discontinue procedure any time safety would be compromised. Turn in completed coupons or electronic versions during the MX debrief. Ensure all coupons are hand- carried to home station when returning from depot modifications or maintenance inputs. The FE must ensure the following conditions are achieved in order to capture valid data: (T-2) 12.8.1.  Power  is  stabilized  for  5  minutes  at  cruise  speed  with  the  autothrottle  off  prior  to recording data. 12.8.2.  Do not change conditions (power setting, altitude, airspeed, etc) once the FEs begin recording  data.  Conditions  must  remain  constant  for  a  minimum  of  12  seconds  to  capture valid data. (T-2) 12.8.3.  Turbulence. Light turbulence is permissible. 12.8.4.  Altitude. Optimum altitude includes FL 250 up to FL 450.

The  FA  is  the  direct  contact  between  the  US  Air  Force  and  the passenger. The FA primary duties include meal preparation, door and air stair operation, border clearance  requirements,  passenger  instruction  on  the  use  of  emergency  equipment  and  the conduct  of  emergency  egress  when  necessary.  Additionally,  FAs  act  as  the  AC’s  cabin representative, provide cabin service and maintain cabin cleanliness throughout the mission. On multi-FA  crews,  the  first  FA  acts  as  FA  supervisor  and  delegates  specific  duties  and responsibilities  to  each  FA.    Instructor  Flight  Attendants  are  authorized  to  teach  E-4B  AFE Familiarization  Training  (LL01),  E-4B  Egress  Training  (LL03),  and  AFE  Recurrent  Training (LL06). 13.3.  FA Standards. 13.3.1.  When  making  contact  with  the  party,  FAs  will  wear  the  appropriate  uniform  as prescribed by the 1 ACCS/DO. (T-3)  Comply with all FCG requirements. 13.3.2.  Any  problems  encountered  with  passengers  during  the  mission  (i.e.  mistreating  the aircraft,  disorderly  behavior,  etc.)  should  be  forwarded  to  the  contact  through  the  AC  for appropriate action. 13.3.3.  FA Augmentees. Occasionally, multiple mission taskings create shortages in the FA crew  force.  In  these  cases,  the  1  ACCS/DO  may  elect  to  augment  missions  with  other qualified  E-4B  crewmembers,  FAs  from  SAM  aircraft,  and/or  upgrading  E-4B  initial qualification FAs. In all cases, augmentees must be under the supervision of an instructor FA and cannot perform FA-specific flight manual procedures (aircraft preflight, etc).  (T-2) 13.4.  Pre-Mission Duties. 13.4.1.  Contact the AC or navigator for itinerary times. Determine all wet/dry ice and bottled water requirements at this time. 13.4.2.  Meal  Service.  The  first  FA  or  designated  representative  will  make  contact  with  the mission  POC  to  determine  cabin  service  requirements  and  obtain  necessary  funds.  (T-2)When  funds  are  not  available  prior  to  mission  execution,  obtain  funds  from  the  in-flight funds  custodian.  Complete  all  portions  of  AF  4084,  Air  Passenger  Specialist  Mission Planning Worksheet. Procure needed supplies (food, beverages, special requirements, etc.) and retain all receipts. 13.4.3.  The first FA will conduct an FA brief and assign all FA positions and duties. (T-2) During  the  pre-mission  briefing,  the  AC  and  first  FA  should  clearly  define  aircrew  duties during emergency situations. This includes, but is not limited to, egress, cabin smoke and/or fire, hot brakes, and emergency passenger handling duties. During emergency situations, the highest qualified FA should assume command of the emergency and direct all FA actions. 13.4.4.  Prior  to  flight,  FAs  will  place  one  copy  of  the  completed  flight  orders  and  Entry Authorization List (EAL) in the location designated by the 1 ACCS/DO. (T-2) AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 55 13.5.  Pre-Flight Duties. 13.5.1.  Perform  applicable  preflight  or  enroute  checklists.  When  more  than  one  FA  is assigned to a mission, this preflight may be accomplished by one FA or divided into zones, as necessary. Check that applicable passenger information cards are properly distributed. 13.5.2.  Upload  food  and  fleet  items  and  stow  as  necessary.  If  aircraft  availability  and maintenance  scheduling  allows,  consideration  should  be  given  to  loading  non-perishable items the day prior to departure. 13.5.3.  Prepare  meals  as  required.  Focus  of  preflight  duties  is  directed  toward  passenger service to ensure completion prior to station time and not inhibited by crew meal service. 13.5.4.  Coordinate receipt of passenger manifests. 13.5.5.  Coordinate passenger baggage loading and security. 13.6.  Passenger Handling. 13.6.1.  Do  not  unduly  alarm  passengers  by  relaying  details  of  abnormal  conditions  not readily discernible by passengers. 13.6.2.  Inform the AC immediately of passenger problems such as those involving unusual requests or bizarre or disruptive behavior. 13.7.  Border  Clearance.  Certain  forms  for  border  clearance  are  mandatory  by  customs, immigration, public health and agriculture. The FA is the custodian for these and other required forms and will ensure adequate quantities are aboard the aircraft prior to takeoff. (T-2) The first FA  should  be  familiar  with  the  Foreign  Clearance  Guide  and  AMC  Border  Clearance  Guide requirements for applicable destinations and will distribute forms to the crew and passengers, as necessary, for completion prior to landing. (T-2) 13.8.  En Route and Post-Flight Duties. 13.8.1.  FAs will provide cabin and meal service while maintaining the highest standards of safety  and  cabin  discipline.  (T-2)    During  critical  phases  of  flight  or  turbulence,  ensure  all loose items are stowed. Suspend cabin service if necessary. 13.8.2.  Operational  Missions.  Meal  service  is  provided  on  all  operational  missions  as directed by the 1 ACCS/DO, OTC, AC, and/or mission directives. 13.8.3.  Training  Missions.  Meal  service  may  be  offered  for  all  sorties  when  at  least  45 minutes  of  cruise  time  is  available  (TWA  sorties,  navigation  legs,  etc).  In  all  other  cases, meal preparation is at the discretion of the FA. Instructor FAs may also use local trainers to instruct meal preparation. When meal service is not practical, the FA will order and pick up meals from the flight kitchen for crewmembers who desire a meal. (T-2) 13.8.4.  Attend to flight crew needs when passenger service duties permit. 13.8.5.  Assist with passenger deplaning and baggage offload or transfer. Ensure passengers do not leave baggage unattended around aircraft or personal items on the aircraft. 13.8.6.  FAs  are  responsible  for  aircraft  cleanliness.  They  are  also  responsible  for  ensuring that  all  food  items  are  properly  stored  and  aircraft  is  mission  ready  before  departing  home station. All perishable items not used are disposed of in appropriate trash containers prior to 56 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 leaving the aircraft. Follow host nation rules IAW FCG and border clearance guide. Ensure all passenger cabins, galleys and lavatories are cleaned. Blankets and pillowcases should be changed (if needed) at enroute stops and upon return to home station. 13.8.7.  Arrange or procure food and beverages required for subsequent mission legs. When purchasing wet/dry ice from vendors who do not accept an AF 15 or credit card, obtain funds from  the  in-flight  funds  custodian  and  provide  him/her  with  a  receipt.  The  in-flight  funds custodian, in turn, will submit a SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement of Expenditures. (T-2) 13.8.8.  Under no circumstances can either perishable or non-perishable items purchased for the official party be consumed by crewmembers or ground support personnel or taken from the airplane for personal use. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 57 Chapter 14 FUEL PLANNING 14.1.  General.  This chapter provides fuel planning policy and procedures for E-4B operations. It  is  designed  to  assist  aircrews  in  planning  any  and  all  operational  mission  or  trainers.  Fuel conservation and optimization are a priority for all missions. Aircrews and planners should make every  effort  to  reduce  fuel  consumption  on  every  sortie  without  compromising  flight  safety  or training objectives. 14.2.  Cruise Speed.  Normal cruise speed for the E-4B is 350 KIAS/0.84 M, whichever is less. Use high speed cruise only when needed to  satisfy the requirements of the DV or mission. Do not exceed flight manual limitations or FAR and/or host nation aircraft speed restrictions. 14.3.  Fuel Planning.  Fuel planning requirements are in Table 14.1 14.3.1.  Safety.  ACs  retain  the  final  authority  for  and  will  ensure  that  all  factors  are considered when determining the minimum required ramp fuel load (RRFL). (T-2) Factors to consider  include  mission  requirements,  routing  (oceanic,  mountainous  region,  etc),  one engine inoperative (OEI) performance capability, ETPs, destination/alternate weather, and en route hazards and alternate suitability. 14.3.2.  At  a  minimum,  RRFL  consists  of  all  fuel  required  for  engine  start,  taxi,  warm-up, APU  operation,  takeoff,  climb,  cruise,  en  route  reserves  (if  required),  alternate/missed approach (if required), descent, approach, landing, holding (minimum required fuel reserve) and any other mission-essential fuel requirements (alert, PSM, etc). 14.3.2.1.  Do  not  carry  extra  fuel  for  convenience,  but  when  solid  ORM  and  safety  of flight  considerations  call  for  it,  do  not  hesitate  to  mitigate  risk/safety  factors  by  adding fuel. 14.3.2.2.  Refueling at  Enroute Stops. When fuel  availability  is  limited or not  available, mission  requirements  preclude  refueling,  or  refueling  would  be  detrimental  to  mission accomplishment, extra fuel may be added to RRFLs. 14.3.3.  Alternate  Fuel.  As  a  minimum,  alternate  fuel  includes  fuel  for  a  flight  from  the intended destination to  the furthest  alternate  aerodrome at  optimum altitude and long  range cruise  speed.  When  holding  is  necesssary,  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  at  a  remote  or  island destination,  compute  holding  for  2+00  (1+15  holding  in  lieu  of  an  alternate  and  0+45  fuel reserve). 14.3.4.  If  decompression  would  cause  descent  to  an  altitude  resulting  in  fuel  consumption exceeding planned fuel, add fuel to recover at a suitable airfield from the Equal Time Point (ETP) at the appropriate altitude. This is not required if the aircraft can recover to a suitable airfield at FL 250 at long range cruise (LRC) speed from ETP.   58 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 Table 14.1.

Commercial Jet A1+ Note: Commercial airports and military airfields may  refuse  to  defuel  airplanes  (USAF  Airfields  accept  all  authorized  fuels).  Ensure  airplane defueling is preplanned accordingly. 14.5.  Standard Ramp Fuel (SRF).  SRFs for the E-4B are authorized as follows: 14.5.1.  Home Station. SRF is 180,000 pounds. 14.5.2.  Alert Mission. SRF is 180,000 pounds at all locations. 14.5.3.  Local  Training  Sorties.  Plan  to  arrive  at  the  IAF  with  30,000  pounds  plus  any required alternate fuel. 14.5.4.  SRFs  may  be  adjusted  by  the  1  ACCS/DO,  AC  or  OTC  as  necessary  for  mission accomplishment. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 59 Chapter 15 AIR REFUELING (A/R) PROCEDURES 15.1.  General.  This  chapter establishes procedures for air  refueling the E-4B. Crews will also comply with all procedures and restrictions in the flight and air refueling manuals. 15.2.  Limitations.  The following limitations apply: 15.2.1.  AC’s  will  not  conduct  air  refueling  will  not  be  conducted  under  the  following conditions: (T-2) 15.2.1.1.  A/R  Without  Tanker  Disconnect  Capability.  Without  tanker  disconnect capability means the boom operator cannot initiate an immediate disconnect. If A/R must be  accomplished,  receivers  will  use  emergency  boom  latching  (EBL)  procedures published in the flight manual and must initiate all disconnects. (T-2) 15.2.1.2.  Emergency  Boom  Latching.  Failure  of  the  receiver’s  signal  amplifier  has occurred.  If  A/R  must  be  accomplished,  the  receiver  must  initiate  all  disconnect  since tanker disconnect capability is inoperative. (T-2) 15.2.1.3.  Engine-Out.  Either  the  tanker  or  receiver  has  less  than  the  full  number  of engines operating 15.2.1.4.  The tanker is unable to retract the landing gear. 15.2.1.5.  Conditions  are  encountered  that,  in  the  opinion  of  either  AC  or  the  boom operator, result in marginal control of either aircraft or the boom. 15.2.1.6.  Tanker  or  receiver  experiences  any  flight  control  problem.  Note:  If  A/R  must be  accomplished,  aircrews  will  not  approach  closer  than  1  NM  until  it  is  positively ascertained  that  A/R  operations  are  safe  to  conduct.  (T-2)  Note:  Boom  operator  and receiver  pilot  must  coordinate  all  actions  as  required  by  applicable  directives  and checklists  when  making  A/R  contacts  during  the  situations  listed  above.  (T-2) EXCEPTION:    Fuel  emergency  situations,  Single  Integrated  Operations  Plan  (SIOP), and  when  executing  HHQ-directed  taskings.  Limit  contacts  to  the  minimum  number required to complete mission. 15.2.2.  Reverse-flow A/R.  Accomplish only during a tanker fuel emergency situation. 15.2.3.  Emergency  Separations/Breakaways.  Follow  procedures  in  IAW  T.O.  1E-4B(II)-1. Once  the  situation  has  stabilized  and  the  receiver  is  well  clear,  notify  the  tanker  and coordinate clearance back to pre-contact. 15.2.4.  Receiver A/R Training for Unqualified Pilots. In-flight training will be accomplished under  direct  IP  supervision.  (T-2)  IPs  will  occupy  one  of  the  pilot  seats  no  later  than  pre-contact until post A/R. (T-2) 15.2.5.  Seat Swaps. If a receiver seat  change takes place, move back to  at least 100 feet in trail of the tanker and to a point where the receiver pilot can maintain visual contact with the entire tanker until the seat change is complete. 15.2.6.  Weather Limitations. 60 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 15.2.6.1.  Turbulence. Terminate refueling if the actual turbulence encountered creates a situation where safe refueling operations are not assured. 15.2.6.2.  Visibility.  Do  not  approach  closer  than  1  NM  unless  you  have  visual  contact with  the  tanker(s).  Discontinue  refueling  if  in-flight  visibility  is  insufficient  to  continue safe refueling operations. 15.3.  Communications  Failure.  ACs  will two-way communications failure while conducting A/R continue flight in accordance with the following procedures. (T-2) experiencing ensure aircraft 15.3.1.  Discontinue  refueling.  EXCEPTION:  EWO  operations  and/or  bona  fide  fuel emergencies. 15.3.2.  Rendezvous.  Maintain  a  minimum  of  1,000  feet  vertical  separation  until  reliable radio communications are established. 15.4.  Altitude  Reservations  (ALTRV).  An  ALTRV  is  an  authorization  by  one  of  the  central altitude reservation functions (Central Altitude Reservation Function (CARF), European Control Altitude  Reservation  Function  (EUCARF),  Pacific  Military  Altitude  Reservation  Function (PACMARF))  or,  under  certain  circumstances,  the  appropriate  ARTCC/Combined  Enroute Radar Approach (CERAP) for airspace utilization under a given set of conditions. Air refueling on operational missions often utilizes an ALTRV. ALTRVs may include all or only portions of the intended route of flight. 15.4.1.  PICs will ensure an ALTRV approval is received prior to mission execution. (T-2) 15.4.2.  PICs  will  ensure  aircraft  departs  within  the  assigned  AVANA  (ALTRV  Void  if Aircraft  Not  Airborne)  time  for  the  purpose  of  providing  separation  between  altitude reservations. (T-2) Normal AVANA time is 30 minutes. If a mission is to be delayed beyond the AVANA time, coordinate with the C2 authority as soon as possible. 15.4.3.  PICs will operate aircraft on an ALTRV within the altitude, time, and areas specified in  the  approval.  (T-2)  An  ALTRV  APVL  authorizes  the  aircraft  to  climb  or  descend  as specified.  Controllers  are  not  required  to  issue  a  climb  or  descent  clearance  for  the  various flight segments. They may, however, request that the pilot advise them prior to initiating an altitude change. 15.4.4.  In  a  non-radar  environment,  the  PIC  shall  advise  ATC  if  actual  fix  timing  is  more than plus or minus 5 minutes from the planned ALTRV en route fix estimate. (T-2) 15.4.5.  File  flight  plans  (1801  or  DD175)  containing  ALTRVs  IAW  FLIP  GP.  Include  the name of the ALTRV in the remarks section of the flight plan. ALTRV requests or approvals do not eliminate the responsibility to obtain proper diplomatic clearance or file flight plans. 15.5.  Alternate  Planning.  Aircrews  will  designate  an  alternate  airport  for  each  A/R  event. Suitable A/R alternates must meet the destination alternate weather and fuel reserve requirements outlined in AFI 11-202V3 and this AFI. To the maximum extent possible, aircrews should plan divert  fuel  from  the  A/R  exit  point.  In  every  case,  aircrews  will  not  proceed  beyond  the designated “bingo” point unless the desired offload is complete. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 61 Chapter 16 ALERT PROCEDURES 16.1.  Concept.  The  55  WG  is  directed  to  provide  operationally  ready  E-4B  aircraft  and aircrews to support the NAOC/CC and perform the NAOC mission on a continuous basis. (T-0) To accomplish  this, the 55 WG will  schedule primary crew and aircraft to  ensure a continuous 24-hour alert response capability. (T-2) 16.1.1.  Additional  Aircraft  Generation.  The  55  WG  may  also  be  tasked  to  generate secondary, tertiary, and, if available, quaternary aircraft during times of increased DEFCON or heightened world tensions. 16.1.2.

This  briefing  normally  includes  pertinent  mission,  show-time,  and/or planned event changes as well as any operational limitations or special mission tasking from the NAOC staff. 16.7.7.  Rendezvous  Procedures.  Only  essential  personnel  will  be  out  of  their  seats.  (T-2) Normally, essential personnel include the FA, OTC, CCOC, OT NCOIC, security forces, and two crew chiefs. The FA or designated representative will operate the cargo door. (T-2) 16.7.8.  De-Icing.  The  AC  and  MX  Superintendent  will  ensure  de-icing  service  is  readily available at all times during months when frost or other contamination build-up is possible. (T-2) 16.7.9.  Personnel  will  immediately  inform  their  supervisor  of  any  condition  that  could adversely  affect  the  mission  or  compromise  crew  and/or  aircraft  safety.  (T-3)  Problems should  be  elevated  to  a  level  appropriate  to  the  perceived  impact  on  the  mission.  Any problem serious enough to be elevated to the OT, condition that may affect aircraft status or non-routine  MX  will  be  coordinated  through  the  AC  first.  The  AC  will,  in  turn,  notify  the OTC and/or CCOC. (T-2) 16.7.10.  ATC Procedures. 16.7.10.1.  NAOC operational priority and “Bust Out” procedures are defined in Federal Aviation  Administration  Order  (FAAO)  Joint  Order  (JO)  7610.4S,  Special  Operations, and FAAO JO 7110.65V, Air Traffic Control. 16.7.10.2.  ACs  will  keep  a  copy  of  the  IFR  flight  plan  on  file  with  the  local  base operations  flight  (enroute  locations)  or  in  the  1  ACCS  Mission  Planning  Room  (home- station operations). (T-2) The DD  Form  175 should contain the remark “NAOC Routes and Altitudes May Apply” in the REMARKS section. 16.8.  Mission Changes. 16.8.1.  Aircraft  Status  Changes.  The  AC  will  inform  the  1  ACCS/DO  via  secure  means anytime the aircraft status changes. (T-2) 16.8.2.  Unscheduled Movements.

It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  host  base  weather  flight  (or command post if there is no local base weather shop) to pass all weather advisories, watches and warnings without delay to the NAOC watch officer. The requirements below are those Watches, Warnings, and Advisories that have been coordinated. 16.9.1.  Advisories. Issued for visibility of less than one mile. 16.9.2.  Watches  and  Warnings.  Issued  for  hail  (of  any  size),  winds  35  knots  or  greater, freezing precipitation, heavy snow, moderate/severe thunderstorms, lightning, and tornadoes. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 65 16.10.  Alert Force Exercises. 16.10.1.  Limitations.  The  AC  shall  immediately  notify  the  CCOC  and  1  ACCS/DO  when any  condition  exists  which  would  preclude  executing  alert  force  movement  exercises (weather,  maintenance,  airfield  limitations,  crew  rest,  etc).  (T-2)  Aircrew  may  reference NAOC Manual 9-3 for a list of weather factors or other conditions which affect an alert force movement exercise. 16.10.2.  Safety.  Minimum  launch  timing  is  mandatory  and  thus,  necessitates  close coordination between all personnel and agencies. Safety remains paramount in all exercises. The AC is the final authority in determining when conditions warrant a greater safety margin. Immediately  terminate  exercises  when  any  unsafe  condition  develops  which  presents  a hazard to the aircrew and/or aircraft. 16.10.3.  Boarding  the  Aircraft.  Proceed  in  an  expeditious  and  safe  manner  to  the  aircraft. Board  via  the  forward  lower  lobe  air-stairs  and  accomplish  all  appropriate  procedures  and checklists. To enhance safety, respond to the aircraft with items properly secured and stowed. 16.10.4.  A NAOC battle staff member will deliver the AC's notification card to the navigator or other flight crewmember as soon as possible. (T-2) 16.10.5.  FA will get a verbal or visual signal from the CCOC or Operations Superintendent that  all  required  personnel  are  on-board  the  aircraft.  (T-2)  The  FA  will  then  pass  this information to the flight-deck. (T-2) 16.10.6.  Taxi. Comply with the restrictions of paragraph 5.10.1. Limit taxi speeds to those listed in paragraph 5.7. 16.10.7.  Simulated Takeoff. To simulate takeoff, momentarily advance the throttles to TRT then smoothly retard the throttles to idle. Reverse thrust should not be activated. 16.10.8.  Exercise Timing Sheet. The navigator will record alert exercise timing by denoting key times on the timing sheet. (T-2) At the completion of the exercise, the AC will validate exercise timing with the NAOC watch officer and sign the NAOC exercise timing sheet. (T-2) 16.10.9.  Termination  Procedures.  Terminate  all  exercises  by  broadcasting,  “This  is  (call sign), Terminate, Terminate, Terminate” on the appropriate radio frequency. Command post, tower,  ground,  UHF  guard  frequencies  may  be  used.  Notify  the  watch  officer  when  the termination is broadcast. If an exercise is terminated prior to arriving at the aircraft, proceed to  the  aircraft  with  caution  and  await  further  instructions  from  the  OTC.  Aircrews  may review NAOC Manual 9-3 for expanded termination procedures. 16.11.  Minimum  Response  Posture  (MRP).  MRP  allows  for  faster  response  times  during periods of heightened world  tensions.  The flight  crew  and OT remain aboard the aircraft when operating under MRP. Aircrews will comply with the following guidance: 16.11.1.  Maintain an immediate engine start and launch capability. (T-2) 16.11.2.  Assume MRP either in the normal parking location or at the end of the runway. If parked  at  the  end  of  the  runway,  use  self-sustained  alert  procedures  to  maintain  on  board electrical, pneumatic, and engine start capability. (T-2) 66 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 16.11.3.  The  AC  and  CCOC  will  coordinate  all  aircraft  servicing  and  security  forces protection as required. (T-2)  16.11.4.  The FA will coordinate meal requirements with the AC and OT NCOIC. (T-2) 16.12.  Deployed Alert. 16.12.1.  ADVON  Team.  Prior  to  deployment,  an  ADVON  team  will  review  the  deployed location's  support  plan  and  procedures  as  well  their  ability  to  sustain  alert  operations.  (T-2)The  team  will  coordinate  any  changes  to  the  base’s  support  plan  and  procedures  prior  to the  alert  team  arriving.  (T-2)  Headquarters  (HQ)  ACC/A3CN  retains  overall  responsibility for ADVON as outlined in ACC OPORD 84-CY. 16.12.2.  Aircraft Arrival. The ADVON team will brief the alert team on the current support plan  and  procedures.  (T-2)  The  NAOC  Plans  and  Operations  will  also  review  any NIGHTWATCH conflict reports with the AC while the alert aircraft is on station. (T-2) 16.12.3.  Security. Procedures and instructions for alert at deployed locations are contained in AFI 31-118. 16.13.  Maintenance Requirements. 16.13.1.  Manning of Alert Aircraft. Alert aircraft  are “cocked”, ready to  fly  at  a moment’s notice  and  require  continuous  monitoring  of  aircraft  systems.  MX  personnel,  including  the aircraft  quick-start  team,  satisfy  this  need  by  maintaining  a  continuous  watch  on  the  alert aircraft  24/7.  During  alert  launches,  the  quick-start  team  will  initiate  the  alert  engine  start checklist.  (T-2)  Once  in  place,  the  flight  crew  will  continue  the  checklist  at  the  point  and clean up any remaining items. (T-2) Note: During self-sustained operations with one or more engines operating, a member of the quick-start team or flight crew will be in one of the pilot seats. (T-2) 16.13.2.  Maintenance personnel will not: (T-2) 16.13.2.1.  Adjust the pilot's vertical or reclined seat positions. 16.13.2.2.  Change radio, interphone, volume or other switch settings. 16.13.2.3.  Reconfigure the FE’s panel without prior coordination with the FE. 16.13.2.4.  Rearrange aircrew flight/pro gear. 16.13.3.  Maintenance  superintendents  will  obtain  AC  and  CCOC  approval  prior  to performing any non-routine aircraft MX and/or servicing. (T-2) 16.13.4.  Aircraft  Parts  and  Mission  Equipment  Components.  The  authority  to  order  and obtain  repair  parts  rests  solely  with  the  MX  superintendent  (aircraft  equipment)  and/or technical  controller  (mission  equipment).  Either  makes  AFTO  781  write-ups,  obtain  job numbers, and make entries into CAMS. 16.13.4.1.  “Routine”  status  is  the  default  classification  assigned  for  all  part  order requests. Routine orders require delivery within 24 hours. 16.13.4.2.  At  times,  an  “Immediate”  (12  hour  delivery)  or  “Urgent”  (4  hour  delivery) status  may  be  necessary.  Coordinate  either  type  of  request  through  the  CCO  (mission AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 67 equipment) or AC (airframe equipment). In cases where special airlift is needed, NAOC staff operations is the validation authority. 16.13.4.3.  The  MX  superintendent  and/or  CCO  will  brief  the  AC  and  CCOC/OTC  on mission impact, as applicable. (T-2) 16.13.5.  Ground-Flight Deck Coordination. It is imperative that all communications between ground  personnel  and  the  flight  deck  be  clear  and  concise.  Ground  personnel  will acknowledge and read back all instructions  from  the flight  deck. (T-2) To avoid  confusion, use  standard  terminology.  Exercise  close  coordination  and  great  care  when  disconnecting ground  equipment  from  the  aircraft.  Unexpected  aircraft  power  interruptions  can  adversely affect mission equipment and thus, mission operations. 16.14.  Base Restrictions.  Aircrews are normally restricted to those base facilities with operable klaxons. Crewmembers will use established alert routes and paging devices for notification when in transit between facilities with klaxons. (T-2) The OTC may modify alert crew movement areas as  required.  Reference  AFI  31-118  for  local  procedures  and  instructions  at  deployed  locations. Note: Alert crews are restricted to the area south of the runway at Offutt AFB. 16.15.  Transportation. 16.15.1.  Use  of  NAOC  alert  vehicles  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  1  ACCS/DO  and  OTC. Individuals must possess a valid Government Driver’s License and AF Form 483, Certificate of  Competency,  stamped  for  the  Offutt  AFB  flight  line  before  operating  any  NAOC  alert vehicle  on  the  flight  line.  (T-2)  All  vehicles  supplied  for  alert  team  support  are  considered government  owned  vehicles  (GOVs).  Drivers  will  comply  with  instructions  governing  the use of GOVs. (T-2) 16.15.2.  Individuals  will  coordinate  an  alert  response  plan  with  the  personnel  whom  they share a vehicle with prior to its use. Notify personnel of departure and return. (T-2) 16.15.3.  Klaxon  Response.  Use  the  alert  vehicle  response  lights.  Observe  posted  speed limits  in  all  areas.  Only  park  in  designated  parking  areas.  Drive  defensively  and  do  not assume the right-of-way. Always expect that the base populace is unfamiliar with what  you are  doing  when  responding  to  a  klaxon.  Note:  Responding  alert  forces  are  subject  to traffic violations. 16.15.4.  Parking. Do not park vehicles in front of the alert aircraft. For klaxon responses at Offutt  AFB,  park  vehicles  behind  the  blast  fence  along  the  side  of  the  aircraft  to  avoid  jet blast  damage.  When  parking  behind  the  guard  shack,  park  in  single  file  behind  the  white lines to allow wing tip clearance on taxi out. 16.15.5.  Vehicle Inspection. The first driver of each day will inspect the vehicle and sign off the AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report. (T-2) Annotate vehicle discrepancies  and  report  them  immediately  to  the  1  ACCS  Vehicle  Control  NCO  (Offutt AFB) or OT vehicle NCO (enroute stations) so that repairs can be made in a timely fashion. 16.15.6.  Unless restricted by the OTC, personnel may travel anywhere on base provided it is on the alert route. Do not leave the alert route without permission from the OTC. 16.16.  Security.  Security  force  protection  guidelines  are  outlined  in  AFI  31-101  and  DoD Manual S-5210.41-M, Nuclear Weapon Security Manual. 68 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 16.16.1.  Do not escort personnel onto alert aircraft without prior approval from the AC and OTC.  All  personnel  escorted  into  the  PL  1  area  shall  be  signed  in  on  the  AF  Form  1109, Visitor Registration Log. (T-2) Preannounce all visitors with the OT and security forces. 16.16.2.  Maintain  positive  control  of  all  briefcases  and  baggage  to  help  prevent  attacks against the aircraft and/or billeting quarters. 16.16.3.  Cameras.  Use  is  prohibited  on  E-4B  aircraft  without  prior  permission  from  the NAOC/CC  (primary  and  secondary  aircraft)  or  the  1  ACCS/DO  (tertiary  and  quaternary aircraft). 16.16.4.  Security  Forces  Support.  Armed  security  forces  personnel  assigned  to  the  mission and  aboard  alert  aircraft  will  retain  control  of  their  weapons.  (T-2)  The  security  forces section chief will identify those individuals which are armed to the AC and FA. (T-2) 16.17.  Communications  During  Ground  Alert.  NAOC utilizes a system of crew notification klaxons and land mobile radios (LMRs) to maintain continuous communication with and recall capability of alert crews. 16.17.1.  Klaxon  System.  Permanently  installed  klaxon  systems  are  positioned  at  various support  bases  around  the  CONUS  and  other  worldwide  locations.  A  current  list  of  klaxon locations for each support base can be found in NAOC Manual 9-3. 16.17.1.1.  Activation. Except during the daily test, personnel will consider any activation of the klaxon system or alerting device as valid unless specifically notified otherwise by valid  authority.  (T-2)  If,  during  the  daily  test,  the  klaxon  continues  to  sound  for  longer than 10 seconds, it should be treated as a real-world klaxon. 16.17.1.2.  Testing. The OT watch officer will initiate a daily test of the klaxon system at 1400 hours (plus or minus 2 minutes) for the primary  alert location.  (T-2) Tests should last  approximately  10  seconds.  When  arriving  at  a  new  alert  location  after  1400  hours, conduct the initial test as soon as possible. Personnel will immediately notify the watch officer of locations for which the klaxon fails to test properly. (T-2) 16.17.1.3.  Outages.  The  OT  watch  officer  will  notify  the  OTC,  OT  COMMO,  and  1 ACCS COMM personnel when a klaxon test reveals an inoperable klaxon(s). (T-2) Alert personnel will not visit locations with an inoperable klaxon without OTC approval and a second  alerting  device.  (T-2)  In  the  event  of  complete  klaxon  failure  or  when  a significant number of klaxons are inoperable, the OTC will provide specific guidance to the alert force. (T-2) 16.17.1.4.  Repairs. 1 ACCS COMM will initiate repairs with the base CE office. Notify the OT COMMO and watch officer when klaxons are operational. (T-2) 16.17.1.5.  Voice-Klaxon  Procedures.  Utilized  during  periods  of  klaxon  outages  and/or malfunctions,  awaiting  a  successful  system  test,  or  as  directed  by  the  OTC.  When implemented, personnel will be notified that “voice klaxon procedures are in effect.” (T-2)  Do  not  respond  to  klaxon  activation(s)  until  notified  that  “normal  klaxon  procedures are  in  effect.”  Personnel  will  ensure  that  they  have  a  minimum  two  LMRs  in  their possession if they travel away from the primary alert aircraft or crew-rest location. (T-2) 16.17.2.  LMRs. These devices are issued to alert personnel for use when transiting locations other than the aircraft. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 69 16.17.2.1.  Activation.  When  the  OT  watch  officer  activates  the  klaxon  alert  system, LMRs  emit  a  tone  to  alert  all  personnel.  Tones  should  be  followed  by  applicable  voice commands.  In  the  absence  of  a  voice  command,  consider  the  tone  a  real-world  alert response and take action appropriately. 16.17.2.2.  Testing.  LMR  function  is  tested  in  conjunction  with  the  daily  klaxon  test. Personnel will immediately notify the watch officer of locations for which the LMR fails to test properly. (T-2) 16.17.2.3.  COMSEC.  Turn  off  LMRs  when  entering  the  alert  aircraft  or  secure  areas where classified information might be discussed. LMR batteries are to be removed from the  radio  when  applicable.  Notify  the  OT  watch  officer  of  location  and  phone  number prior to turning off the radio. 16.17.2.4.  Security.  Safeguard  all  LMRs  to  eliminate  the  possibility  of  unauthorized access and/or having them returned with surveillance and/or explosive devices installed. 16.17.2.5.  Hazard  Areas.  Do  not  operate  LMRs  within  50  feet  of  open  fuel  sources  or refueling operations. LMRs are capable of generating sufficient electrical and/or thermal energy to ignite combustible materials. Do not make electronic voice transmissions from the aircraft while hot-refueling procedures are in progress. 16.18.  Generating Additional Aircraft. 16.18.1.  Aircrews  may  be  tasked  to  generate  additional  E-4B  aircraft  for  a  variety  of reasons.  The  type  of  notification  used  depends  upon  the  type  of  aircrew  response  required. Crewmembers  will  pay  special  attention  to  the  exact  words  used  in  recall  messages  and accurately relay the message along the notification chain. (T-2) 16.18.2.  Full  EWO  Generation  and  Mobilization.  Commanders  will  initiate  all  alert  recalls utilizing the pyramid recall roster. (T-2) All personnel will report immediately with full alert or mobility gear and in the duty uniform unless instructed otherwise. (T-2) 16.18.3.  Limited  Generation  and  Mobilization.  The  NAOC/CC  and/or  1  ACCS/CC  will direct the recall of applicable personnel. (T-2) All personnel will report immediately with full alert or mobility gear and in the duty uniform unless instructed otherwise. (T-2)  16.18.3.1.  Single aircraft generation for alert aircraft tail-swaps normally only require the recall  of  the  reserve  standby  force.  Section  show  times  may  be  staggered  based  on individual preflight requirements. 16.18.3.2.  Generation of an additional aircraft for sustained operations may be performed by non-Reserve or Reserve crew members as circumstances dictate. 16.18.3.3.  Aircrews  assuming  alert  following  generation  activities  can  expect  a  seven- day alert (minimum) and will comply with the requirements of paragraph  16.4 (T-2) 16.18.4.  When  recalling  personnel  not  in  conjunction  with  a  55  WG-initiated  base-wide recall, the 1 ACCS/CC will contact the following agencies to ensure full coordination: (T-2) 16.18.4.1.  Command Post. 16.18.4.2.  The 55 OG/CC. 16.18.4.3.  The 1 ACCS Operations Scheduling. Recall flight crew(s) as directed. 70 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 16.18.4.4.  The 1 ACCS Communications Branch. Recall mission crew(s) as directed. 16.18.4.5.  The  1  ACCS  Operational  Support  Team.  Activate  the  alert  facility,  prepare flight orders, and generate mission packages. 16.18.4.6.  The  1  AMU  Maintenance  Branch.  Notify  appropriate  MX  personnel.  Ensure Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) personnel are also notified and initiate their recall. Confirm fuel loads, tail number, and aircraft status. 16.18.5.  COMSEC/Operations  Security  (OPSEC).  Use  great  care  in  what  and  how information is passed. Use secure means to relay any and all classified information. 16.18.6.  Timing.  Safely  generate  aircraft  as  expeditiously  as  possible.  For  expeditious generation, comply with the following guidance: 16.18.6.1.  Maintenance. The 1 AMU will provide a fully mission capable (FMC) aircraft fueled to meet the next scheduled sortie’s requirements as soon as possible and/or prior to each weekend. (T-2) 16.18.6.2.  Operations.  When  airborne  aircraft  flying  training  sorties  must  be  generated immediately, 1 ACCS/DO will recall the aircraft. (T-2) Once recalled, the crew will call 1  ACCS/DO  by  any  means  available  with  ETA,  maintenance  status,  and  estimated landing fuel as soon as possible and continue to monitor Ops frequency.

TERPS—Terminal Instrument Procedures TWA—Trailing Wire Antenna TC—Tech Controller VO—Voice Operator Terms ADVON—Advanced Echelon; personnel who arrange support for an upcoming E-4 deployment. Bird Watch Condition (BWC) Low—Bird activity on and around the airfield representing low potential for bird strikes. Bird Watch Condition Moderate—Concentrations of small birds or isolated large bird activity observable  near  the  runway  or  in  locations  that  represent  a  potential  hazard  to  safe  flying operations. Bird  Watch  Condition  Severe—Heavy  concentrations  of  small  birds  or  significant  large  bird activity  on  or  immediately  above  the  active  runway,  taxiways,  in-field  areas  or  the arrival/departure corridor which represents a significant hazard to safe flying operations. Category  I  Route—Any  route  that  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  a  category  II  route, including tactical navigation and over water routes. Category  II  Route—Any  route  on  which  the  position  of  the  aircraft  can  be  accurately determined  by  the  overhead  crossing  of  a  radio  aid  (NDB,  VOR,  TACAN)  at  least  once  each hour with positive course guidance between such radio aids. Critical Phase of Flight—Engine start, takeoff, landing, and emergencies. Deadhead  Time—Duty  time  for  crewmembers  positioning  or  de-positioning  for  a  mission  or mission support function and not performing crew duties. Due Regard—Operational situations that do not lend themselves to International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO)  flight  procedures,  such  as  military  contingencies,  classified  missions, politically  sensitive  missions,  or  training  activities.  Flight  under  "Due  Regard"  obligates  the military aircraft commander to be his or her own air traffic control (ATC) agency and to separate his or her aircraft from all other air traffic. (See FLIP General Planning, section 7.) Equal  Time  Point  (ETP)—Point  along  a  route  at  which  an  aircraft  may  either  proceed  to destination or first suitable airport or return to departure base or last suitable airport in the same amount of time based on all engines operating. AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 77 Flight  Crew—For the purposes of this AFI, the flight  crew is  defined as all pilots,  navigators, flight engineers, and flight attendants. Instructor  Supervision—Supervision  by  an  instructor  of  like  specialty.  For  critical  phases  of flight,  the  instructor  must  occupy  one  of  the  seats  or  stations,  with  immediate  access  to  the controls. Maintenance Status—x A-1;—No maintenance required. A-2;—Minor maintenance required, but not serious enough to  cause delay. Add  system phonic code that identifies the affected units or systems, Alpha, Bravo, etc. A-3;—Major  maintenance  required.  Delay  is  anticipated.  Affected  units  or  systems  are  to  be identified as in A-2 status above. Mission Crew—For the purposes of this AFI, the mission crew is defined as all communication specialist crewmembers. Nightwatch—The  unclassified  callsign/nickname  for  the  Joint  Staff  Battlestaff  and  USAF support of the NAOC mission. Operational  Control  (OPCON)—Transferable  command  authority  that  may  be  exercised  by commanders at any echelon at or below the level of combatant command. Operational control is inherent in combatant command (command authority). Operational control may be delegated and is  the  authority  to  perform  those  functions  of  command  over  subordinate  forces  involving organizing  and  employing  commands  and  forces,  assigning  tasks,  designating  objectives,  and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission. Operational control includes authoritative  direction  over  all  aspects  of  military  operations  and  joint  training  necessary  to accomplish missions assigned to the command. Operational control should be exercised through the  commanders  of  subordinate  organizations.  Normally  this  authority  is  exercised  through subordinate  joint  force  commanders  and  Service  and/or  functional  component  commanders. Operational  control  normally  provides  full  authority  to  organize  commands  and  forces  and  to employ those forces as the commander in operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions. Operational  control does not, in  and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM)—A  logic-based,  common  sense  approach  to  making calculated decisions on human, materiel, and environmental factors before, during, and after Air Force  operations.  It  enables  commanders,  functional  managers  and  supervisors  to  maximize operational  capabilities  while  minimizing  risks  by  applying  a  simple,  systematic  process appropriate for all personnel and Air Force functions. Power-on Checks—Aircraft checks accomplished by aircrews which do not involve engine start and/or  aircraft  acceptance.  Primarily  used  to  verify  proper  system  configurations  and  switch positions at aircrew duty stations during ground alert duty. Primary Aircraft—The first generated E-4B aircraft able to fully perform the NAOC mission. Quaternary Aircraft—A fourth E-4B aircraft capable of being generated to perform the NAOC mission. 78 AFI11-2E-4V3  17 DECEMBER 2015 Secondary Aircraft—A second E-4B aircraft capable of being generated to perform the NAOC mission Tertiary  Aircraft—A  third  E-4B  aircraft  capable  of  being  generated  to  perform  the  NAOC mission.
