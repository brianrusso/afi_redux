SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  instruction  has  been  totally  revised  and  must  be  reviewed  in  its  entirety.    Major  changes include realignment and renumbering of chapters, new section and sub-section titles and revised tables.    The  rewrite  updates  roles  and  responsibilities  for  the  responsible  offices.    The Furnishings  Management  Office  (FMO)  is  renamed  to  the  Furnishings  Management  Section (FMS).  The rewrite removed the title “Dormitory Manager” and replaced with “Airmen Dorm Leader  (ADL)”.    It  establishes  policy  for  mandatory  use  of  the  DoD  and  Air  Force  approved automated system, Enterprise Military Housing (eMH) to record, manage, monitor and track the furnishings  for  life  cycle  management.    The  rewrite  eliminates  the  Quarters  Improvement Committee  and  the  Quarters  Improvement  Plan.    A  new  requirement  is  the  5-year  long-range furnishings  plan  which  requires  Installation  Commander  approval.    The  back-up  stock  level  is established  at  no  more  than  three  percent  (3%)  of  current  furnishings.    The  furnishings authorizations  are  modified  and  a  new  authorization  for  furnishing  the  Airmen  Dorm  Leader office has been added.

Use the date of receipt to determine depreciation allowances on statements of charges, cash collection vouchers, deficiency reports, and reports of survey. 3.5.  Repair and Replacement of Furnishings.  Repair and maintenance may be performed in-house or through local service contracts.  Furniture may not be replaced unless the estimated cost of  repair  or  rehabilitation,  including  any  transportation  expense,  exceeds  at  least  75  percent  of the cost of a new item of the same type and class.  An exception is authorized in those unusual situations when rehabilitation of the furniture at 75 percent of the cost of a new item would not extend its useful life for a period compatible with the cost of rehabilitation.  Replace appliance if the one-time cost for repair of the appliance is greater than 55 percent of replacement value. 3.5.1.  Use manufacturer’s warranty service to the fullest extent. 3.5.2.  Use O&M funds to repair furnishings procured with O&M funds; Use MFH funds to repair furnishings procured with FH funds. 3.5.3.  Establish  a  repair  and  preventive  maintenance  (PM)  Program  within  FMS  for  APF-purchased  items.  This  program  includes  minor  re-gluing,  minor  touch-up  of  surfaces  (i.e., touchup stain pens), tightening and adjusting hardware, and replacement of small parts (i.e., knobs on stoves, refrigerator drawers, etc.). AFI32-6004  27 JANUARY 2016   21  3.5.4.  Use contract repair services when furnishings repair requirements exceed capability of the  installation  FMS  PM  program.    Also,  consider  using  contractor  pickup  and  delivery  of items. 3.5.5.  In CONUS and non-foreign OCONUS, the HMO competitively sources the appliance Maintenance  &  Repair  (M&R)  contract  and/or  repairs  may  be  provided  on  an  as-needed basis via Government Purchase Card (GPC).  In foreign OCONUS, appliance M&R is done either  in-house  or  through  a  maintenance  contract,  depending  on  the  most  cost  effective method at the location. 3.5.6.  Use  NAF  for  repairs  of  furnishings  items  purchased  with  NAF  funds  IAW  AFI  65-106. 3.5.7.  Members may deliver furnishings items to FMS for repair or may request FMS pickup and  delivery  service.    FMS  inspects  the  furnishings  to  determine  whether  it  needs replacement because of fair wear and tear or negligence and informs the member. 3.5.8.  Dispose replaced or unserviceable furnishings to DLADS. 3.6.  Calculation of Depreciation Cost.  FMS will implement a depreciation method to allocate, in  a systematic  way, the total  amount to  be depreciated between each accounting period of the useful economic life of the asset.  (T-3)  The straight line method of depreciation is widely used and simple to calculate.  It is based on the principle that each accounting period of the asset life should bear an equal amount of depreciation.  Use Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1 to determine repair or replacement decision based on straight line depreciation model. Table 3.1.  Furnishings/Appliance Life-Cycle Guide. Furniture Life-Cycle Guide.

The  Housing  management  Office  must  market/advertise  items that are determined to be excess at an installation for use by other AF installations before final disposition.  (T-1) 3.7.1.  Installations and MAJCOMs initiate actions to advertise excess furnishings. 3.7.1.1.  The Housing Manager submits to the MAJCOM of the items that are determined to  be  excess  at  an  installation  using  the  template  datasheet  (located  in  AF/CE  Portal, Housing  Program  Group  website).    Installation  request  must  include  a  written economic  determination  that  the  future  use  of  the  excess  items  can  be  made  without costly  repairs  and/or  refinishing,  transporting  can  be  done  without  severe  damage  to AFI32-6004  27 JANUARY 2016   23  item(s), and transportation cost are economically feasible (supported by a comparison of item value with the remaining useful lifecycle including wrapping and packing). 3.7.1.2.  MAJCOM  validates advertises to other installations within the MAJCOM. the installation  excess  furnishings  submission  and 3.7.1.3.  If needed, MAJCOM forwards information to AF/A4CF to maximize marketing across AF for posting on the AF/CE Portal, Housing Program Group website. 3.7.1.4.  MAJCOM monitors AF-wide marketing efforts.  If excess furnishings items are not required by other Air Force installations within 30 day, then approves the installation Base Civil Engineer to make offer excess furnishings to other agencies on the installation. 3.7.2.

Agency  representatives  accept  furnishings  and  appliances  for  their  respective facilities  by  signing  a  master  AF  Form  228  to  acknowledge  the  type,  quantity,  serial number, and condition of the items. 4.3.1.2.  For unaccompanied housing, the senior ADL accepts furnishings and appliances on a master AF Form 228 and then reissues items to residents by room assignment.

For  members  in  government  family  housing,  as  well  as  members  stationed  at OCONUS  installations  and  residing  in  a  rental  housing  in  community,  the  HMO/FMS issues furnishings and appliances to members using AF Form 228 (furnishings) and AF Form  227,  Quarters  Condition  Inspection  Report  (in-place  appliances  for  government housing).
