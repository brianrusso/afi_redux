Unit-level operations along with maintenance and support functions must ensure KC-135  aircraft  are  properly  configured  in  accordance  with  this  chapter.  Units  will  prepare aircraft  configuration  worksheets,  Figure  1.1  thru  Figure  1.9,  based  on  the  configuration required.  Aircraft  configurations  may  be  amended  by  specific  command  and  control  (C2) mission tasking. AFE will prepare AFTO Form 46, Prepositioned Aircrew Flight Equipment. Each  affected  agency  is  responsible  for  the  actual  aircraft  configuration  check.  Units  may utilize locally developed or approved computer products as the configuration checklist. 1.6.6.1.  When  used,  two  copies  of  the  aircraft  configuration  worksheet  prepared  by  the originating  unit  will  accompany  all  aircraft  to  off  station  employment  locations.  One copy  will  be  filed  on  top  of  the  DD  Form  365-3,  Chart  C,  Basic  Weight  and  Balance Record. The second copy is used at the off station employment location to verify arrival or re-deployment configuration of the aircraft and to provide aircraft weight and balance data for mission planning. AFI11-2KC-135V3_ADDENDA-A  25 APRIL 2012   7  1.6.6.2.  The  off  station  employment  location  will  notify  the  originating  unit  of configuration discrepancies. 1.7.  Aircraft  Configuration  Waivers.  Follow  waiver protocol in  AFI  11-2KC-135 Volume 3 paragraph 1.4. 1.8.  Supply  Accountability.  See  AFMAN  23-110V2,  Standard  Base  Supply  Customer Procedures,  for  accountability  and  transfer  provisions,  except  when  specific  command  and control (C2) mission tasking provides additional guidance. 1.9.  Corner Braces And Cargo/Baggage Bins And Tie-Down Shackles. 1.9.1.  Local manufacture of corner braces for cargo/baggage bins per the instructions listed in this chapter is authorized. Bins are constructed with 3/4 inch Douglas fir plywood. Secure bins in aircraft IAW Figure 1.13 1.9.2.  Operations  personnel  must  identify  specific  needs  for  braces  on  other  deployments and  missions  and  coordinate  with  appropriate  maintenance  agencies  for  number  and availability of devices. 1.9.3.  The maintenance squadron Dash 21 section will store and control braces when not in use. 1.9.4.  These  devices  will  enhance  safety  and  improve  operational  capability  of  KC-135 aircraft  in  the  cargo  and  passenger  environment.  In  order  to  implement  this  program,  units should comply with the following instructions: 1.9.4.1.  Air  refueling  squadron.  Based  on  previous  off  station  requirements  and  known contingency commitments determine total number of braces required and coordinate the total requirement with the AME section. 1.9.4.2.  At off station locations, evaluate the need for storing additional devices to build more baggage bins if needed. 1.9.5.  In order to utilize these devices, pre-cut plywood shoring for each bin as follows: 1.9.5.1.  Forward  and  aft  ends  of  bin.  Utilize  3  feet  by  4  feet  pieces  of  plywood.  Units may opt to use 4 foot wide bins. Bin top pieces must be cut to match bin width. In order to exercise this new size option do not discard serviceable 3 foot by 4 foot plywood end pieces  until  deemed  unserviceable.    Sides  of  bin  will  utilize  a  full  4  foot  by  8  foot plywood sheets. 1.9.5.2.  Top of bin. Utilize one 3 foot by 8 foot piece of plywood. Experience has proven that pre-cut shoring won’t degrade operational requirement of providing adequate shoring material for cargo requirements. If the option to increase bin sizes in paragraph 1.9.5.1 is used, the bin top size will be a full (4 X 8 feet) sheet of plywood. 1.9.6.  For planning purposes, use the following weights for empty bins 1.9.6.1.  Bins  constructed 3 feet  in  width  are approximately 250 pounds each to  include corner braces. 1.9.6.2.  Bins  constructed 4 feet  in  width  are approximately 285 pounds each to  include corner braces.   8  AFI11-2KC-135V3_ADDENDA-A  25 APRIL 2012 Table 1.1.
