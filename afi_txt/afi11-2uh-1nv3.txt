General.  This  instruction  and  AFI  11-2UH-1NV3,  Checklist  1  (CL-1),  UH-1N  Crew Briefing  Guides/Checklists,  are  used  in  conjunction  with  aircraft  flight  manuals,  Flight Information  Publications  (FLIP),  and  applicable  USAF  publications  to  describe  all  UH-1N training, normal, and contingency operations. 1.1.1.  HQ AFGSC/A3TO has overall responsibility for administration of this instruction and associated checklists.  Submit suggested improvements to this instruction on AF Form 847, Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication,  through  MAJCOM  channels  to  AFGSC/A3T according to AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Program (FMP). 1.1.2.  Throughout this Air Force Instruction (AFI) references are made to Major Command (MAJCOM)  and  Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF)  levels  of  responsibilities.    Due  to  the  diverse nature of the structure of UH-1N units, all references to a particular MAJCOM or NAF office are  intended  to  mean  that  office  or  equivalent.    MAJCOM  supplements  to  this  AFI  will indicate if there is a different office of responsibility (T-2). 1.1.3.  For purposes of this AFI, the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) is considered a MAJCOM. 1.1.4.  For  Air  Force  Global  Strike  Command  (AFGSC),  the  582d  Helicopter  Group Commander  (HG/CC)  is  equivalent  to  OG/CC  and  has  all  WG/CC  authorities  for  all references within this AFI to the OG/CC and/or WG/CC. 1.2.  Deviations  and  Waivers.  The  waiver  authority  for  this  instruction  is  the  MAJCOM/A3 unless otherwise indicated.  When an operational necessity exists and time does not allow pursuit of  a  waiver  through  normal  channels,  the  OG/CC  has  one-time  waiver  authority  to  this instruction.    Report  all  deviations  without  an  approved  MAJCOM  waiver  to  the MAJCOM/A3 within 10 duty days of the occurrence.  MAJCOM POCs will forward a copy of waiver or details of circumstances to AFGSC/A3TO for information only (T-2).  Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this instruction except: 1.2.1.  Aircraft  Commanders  (AC)  may  deviate  from  this  directive  as  necessary  to  protect their crew and aircraft and/or to save lives (T-2). 1.2.2.  When  circumstances  require,  this  publication  provides  guidance  for  helicopter operations under most circumstances, but it does not substitute for sound judgment.  If within communications  range  of  command  and  control  agencies,  deviations  due  to  unusual circumstances should be pre-coordinated. (T-2). 1.3.  Supplements.  MAJCOM supplements shall not be less restrictive than this instruction and shall be IAW AFI 33-360 (T-2). 1.4.  Development  of  New  Equipment  and  Procedures.  Units  desiring  to  use  new  or  not previously  approved  equipment,  to  include  mission  equipment,  must  obtain  individual MAJCOM,  HQ/AFGSC  and  WR-ALC  approval  via  AF  Form  1067,  Modification  Proposal, prior to testing and/or use (T-2). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 7 Chapter 2 GENERAL OPERATING GUIDANCE 2.1.  General.  AFGSC  is  the  Lead  Command  for  UH-1N  operations  and  will  coordinate instruction  changes  and  dissemination  of  revised  information.    Individual  MAJCOMs  may establish command and control guidelines in their supplements (T-2). 2.2.  Aircraft  Commander  Responsibility  and Authority.  For all flights, units will designate an  AC  on  a  flight  authorization  form,  or  equivalent,  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-401,  Aviation Management, as supplemented by MAJCOMs (T-2). ACs are: 2.2.1.  In command of all persons aboard the aircraft and vested with the authority necessary to manage their crew and accomplish the mission. 2.2.2.  Responsible for the welfare of the crew and the safe accomplishment of the mission.  This  begins  upon  notification  and  terminates  upon  completion  of  the  debrief.    If  the  AC determines that conditions  are not  safe to  prosecute the mission, the aircraft will not  depart until the condition is adequately mitigated (T-2). 2.2.3.  The final mission authority and will make decisions not specifically assigned to higher authority (T-2). 2.2.4.  Charged  with  keeping  the  applicable  commander  informed  concerning  mission progress and/or difficulties. 2.2.5.  The final authority for asking for and accepting waivers affecting the crew or mission. 2.2.6.  Responsible for ensuring aircraft security when away from home station. 2.2.7.  The focal point for interaction between aircrew and mission support personnel. 2.3.  Flight  Lead.  Units will designate a Flight  Lead (FL)  for all formation  flights  (T-2).  The Flight Lead is in charge of the entire formation and is responsible for mission accomplishment.  Other  than  formation  training,  MAJCOMs  may  supplement  what  missions  are  considered formation and require a Flight Lead. 2.4.  Mission  Monitoring.  Units  will  accomplish  local  and  off-station  mission  monitoring  in accordance with MAJCOM supplements and Operations Group policies (T-2). 2.5.  Support  to  Civil  Authorities/Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Agencies  .  Within the United States and its territories, request for helicopter support by civil authorities is handled IAW AFI 10-801,  Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities.    Defense  Support  of  Civil  Authorities  (DSCA) operations  are  divided  into  three  broad  categories-domestic  emergencies,  designated  law enforcement  support,  and  other  activities-and  may  overlap  or  be  in  effect  simultaneously, depending upon the event.  MAJCOMs operating outside of the United States and its territories may provide support IAW Combatant Command guidance and local directives. 2.5.1.  Civil Search and Rescue (SAR).  Units within the continental United States must have an Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) mission number prior to conducting an operational  civil  SAR  Mission  (T-2).    This  does  not  preclude  a  unit  from  preparing  and posturing for a mission while waiting for the AFRCC number.  An AFRCC mission number does  not  shift  OPCON  and  confirms  the  request  meets  specific  criteria,  but  units/ACs  may 8 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 withdraw  support  if  the  mission  details  have  changed  significantly.    The  AFRCC  may  be reached  24/7  at  1-800-851-3051  or  DSN  523-5955.    All  Civil  SAR  support  will  be  IAW DoDI 3003.01, DoD Support to Civil SAR, and AFPD 10-45, Air Force Support to Civil SAR (T-2).  Additional  source  documents  for  the  national  SAR  system  can  be  found  at http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg534/NSARC.asp. 2.5.2.  Posse Comitatus Act.  Assistance to Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies.  In general, military  units  are  prohibited  by  law  from  participating  in  civil  law  enforcement  activities (this does not include SAR requests from law enforcement agencies). See AFI 10-801, USC Title  10  Chapter  18,  Military  Support  for  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Agencies  or  consult with  your  Judge  Advocate’s  office  for  more  information.    Units  will  report  all  requests  for assistance and coordinate all requests from  civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate chain of command (T-2). 2.5.3.  Utilization  of  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  or  Medical  Personnel.    Civilian  law enforcement  or  medical  personnel  may  be  required  to  perform  duties  at  an  incident  site.  These  duties  may  include  death  determination  or  human  remains  removal.    Local/ international  laws  may  affect  mission  prosecution  and  should  be  reviewed  prior  to deployment/pickup of civilian personnel. 2.5.3.1.  Approval  Authority.    Approval  Authority  to  carry  civilian  law  enforcement  or medical  personnel  on  SAR  or  Medical  Evacuation  (MEDEVAC)  missions  may  be delegated to the AC under certain circumstances (T-3).  If the AC determines passengers are essential for the successful completion of the mission, and they are unable to contact their controlling agency for approval, passengers may be carried on the segments of flight requiring  their  presence.    Leave  a  copy  of  the  passenger  manifest  with  a  responsible person IAW AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. 2.5.4.  Human Remains.  Rescue personnel should not normally remove human remains from crash or incident sites.  The decision to remove the remains from the site will be made solely by  the  local  authorities  (T-2).    Except  as  per  paragraph  2.5.4.1,  units  will  not  commit resources  to  the  removal  of  human  remains  until  the  mission  approval  and/or  releasing authority  (normally  the  Wing/Group  Commander)  has  been  informed  and  approved  the request  (T-2).  The AC is  responsible for the safety of  resources and should  not  jeopardize them for the recovery of human remains (T-3).  The AC is responsible for compliance with all directions given by local civil authorities concerning the proper removal and handling of remains  in  that  jurisdiction  (T-3).    Written  authorization  from  the  proper  local  authorities should  be  received  prior  to  removal;  however  factors  such  as  accessibility  to  the  area, weather  conditions,  darkness,  etc.  may  preclude  the  practicality  of  receiving  written authorization from local authorities.  In such cases, a verbal authorization may be accepted if followed by a written authorization.   In  extreme  situations  where 2.5.4.1.  Exceptional  Cases. is  critical  and communications  are  impossible,  the  AC  may  remove  remains  and  deliver  them  to  the proper  authorities  if  given  authorization  from  the  appropriate  civil  official.    This procedure  is  authorized  only  if  conditions  already  make  it  impossible  to  obtain  timely approval from the mission approval and/or releasing authority.  Whenever this procedure is  employed,  the  AC  shall  request  and  comply  with  all  directions  given  by  local  civil authorities concerning the proper removal and handling of remains in that jurisdiction (T-time AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 9 3).    Again,  do  not  remove  human  remains  without  permission,  or  prior  to  positive declaration  of  death  by  competent  medical  authority.  (See  Attachment  2,  Example Authorization to Remove Human Remains.) 2.6.  Passenger  Policy.  The  UH-1N  is  a  utility  aircraft  and  is  utilized  through  a  variety  of mission  sets,  including  passenger  transport.  DoDI  4515.13,  Air  Transportation  Eligibility,  and AFI  11-401  contain  guidance  on  passenger  airlift  and  orientation  flights.    Units  must  ensure compliance  with  these  publications  for  passenger  transport  covered  by  their  provisions  (T-2).  The  following  guidance  addresses  passenger  transport  not  covered  by  the  provisions  of  DoDI 4515.13 and AFI 11-401. 2.6.1.  Passengers may be flown on UH-1N aircraft during the normal course of exercise and contingency  operations  of  the  unit.    MAJCOMs  will  detail  the  approval  authority  of  these passengers in a supplement to this AFI (T-2). 2.6.2.  Direct  Mission  Support  (DMS)  denotes  a  mission  where  passengers  are  flown  for specific  purposes  in  support  of  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  missions  (e.g.  missile  site support) where helicopter airlift is specifically needed to accomplish the mission.  This does not include routine point-to-point travel of a passenger. MAJCOMs will detail the approval authority of these missions in a supplement to this AFI (T-2). 2.6.3.  Restrictions.    Aircrew  will  not  perform  simulated  emergency  procedures  with passengers onboard (T-2).  Passengers will be restrained by the safest means possible while still enabling the supported passenger to accomplish their mission (T-2).  The AC will ensure passengers  are  given  a  safety  briefing  and  are  familiar  with  the  mission  profile  and  events before the flight (T-2). 2.6.4.  Manifests.  Units/aircrew will manifest and brief all passengers IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL1, Pilot’s Flight Crew Checklist, AFI 11-401, and MAJCOM guidance (T-2). 2.6.5.  When  passengers  are  in  the  cargo  compartment,  aircrew  will  ensure  the  cargo  doors remain  closed  during  flight  unless  an  aircrew  member  is  also  in  the  cabin  (T-3).    Unit commanders  may  authorize  aircrew  to  open  the  cargo  doors  if  a  valid  need  exists  and  the passengers are thoroughly briefed on cabin personnel and equipment security (T-3). 2.7.  Mission Essential Personnel (MEP).  Refer to AFI 11-401 and MAJCOM Supplement. 10 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 3 AIRCREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Primary  Crewmembers.  Crewmembers  occupying  a  primary  duty  position  during  flight must be UH-1N qualified and current for the mission events to be flown, conducting training/re-currency for that crew position/mission IAW AFI 11-2UH-1NV1, Helicopter Aircrew Training, or designated as a supervisory flyer IAW AFI 11-401 (T-2). 3.1.1.  Instructor  Training  Requirements.    One  instructor  is  required  for  each  duty  position requiring student flight training. Instructors are responsible for the actions of their students. 3.1.2.  MAJCOM supplements will specify operational missions on which training is allowed and provide waiver authority guidance for other operational missions (T-2). 3.1.3.  Functional  Check  Flight  (FCF)  certified  crewmembers  maintaining  basic  aircraft qualification  that  are  non-current  or  unqualified  for  operational/special  mission  items  may perform FCFs. 3.1.4.  After  completion  of  the  Key  Staff  Course  (see  AFI  11-2UH-1NV1),  supervisory flyers,  as  designated  in  AFI  11-401,  may  fly  on  all  mission  profiles  approved  by  their MAJCOM.    Only  supervisory  flyers  who  are  rated  pilots  are  allowed  to  access  the  flight controls. 3.2.  Interfly.  An  interfly  is  the  exchange  and/or  substitution  of  aircrews  and  aircraft  between MAJCOMs.    The  OG/CC  (or  equivalent)  of  the  unit  possessing  the  aircraft  is  the  approval authority for MAJCOM interflys. 3.3.  Intrafly.  An intrafly is the exchange and/or substitution of aircrew members from separate units  under  the  same  MAJCOM.    The  OG/CC  possessing  the  aircraft  is  approval  authority  for intrafly between units. 3.4.  Minimum  Crew.  The  minimum  crew  required  for  flight  defined  in  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1, USAF  Series  UH-1N  Helicopter,  is  one  pilot.    MAJCOMs  will  supplement  the  minimum  crew required for all mission profiles flown by their assigned units, including waiver authority  (T-2).  MAJCOMs will ensure minimum crew requirements are set to minimize risk to safety of flight and mission accomplishment in all conditions that may be reasonably encountered (T-2). 3.4.1.  At  no  time  will  personnel  not  authorized  per  AFI  11-401  manipulate  flight  controls. (T-2). 3.5.  Maximum Flight Duty Period.  IAW AFI 11-202V3, and MAJCOM Supplements. 3.6.  Predeparture  Crew  Rest:  Medical  personnel  called  to  duty  for  urgent  SAR/MEDEVAC missions  with  less  than 12  hours  of  crew  rest  can  perform  lifesaving  duties.    Because  Medical Technicians are Operation Support Flyers (OSF) performing in-flight medical care, no crew rest is  required  for  urgent  SAR/MEDEVACs.    Medical  Technicians  require  adequate  crew  rest  to conduct flying training. AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 11 Chapter 4 MISSION PREPARATION 4.1.  Responsibilities.  The  responsibility  for  mission  planning/preparation  is  shared  jointly  by the individual aircrew members and the operations and intelligence functions of the organization. 4.1.1.  Flight Lead/Aircraft Commanders (or designated crewmember) are responsible for: 4.1.1.1.  Overall  mission  planning,  route  study,  navigation,  personnel  recovery  planning and mission execution. 4.1.1.2.  Verifying Go/No-Go status for all crewmembers. 4.1.1.3.  Assess  risk  management  and  mitigate  appropriately  for  the  flight  using MAJCOM guidance. logical  briefing that  promotes  safe,  effective  mission 4.1.1.4.  Presenting  a accomplishment.  The AC is responsible for ensuring appropriate mission/event briefings are completed prior to accomplishment (T-2).  Mission elements/events may be modified and  briefed  airborne  as  long  as  flight  safety  is  not  compromised.    ACs  will  ensure changes  are  acknowledged  by  all  flight  members/crewmembers  (T-2).

Night unaided: minimum of 1000 foot ceilings and 2 statute miles visibility (T-3).  Note: The above weather minimums do not apply to hover and air taxi operations at the aerodrome. 4.2.3.  Instrument Flight Rules (IFR).  In addition to AFI 11-202V3, the following applies: 12 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 4.2.3.1.  For  planned  flights  in  Instrument  Meteorological  Conditions  (IMC)  or  when IMC is likely, aircrew will complete an instrument cockpit check prior to takeoff (T-2). 4.2.3.2.  The  AN/ASN-175  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  is  not  considered  a "suitable"  Area  Navigation  (RNAV)  system  under  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA) Advisory Circular (AC) 90-108, Use of Suitable RNAV Systems on Conventional Routes  and  Procedures  mission  enhancement  system.    The  AN/ASN  GPS  is  not authorized  as  a  primary  instrument  for  IFR.  It  may  be  used  to  assist  in  maintaining situational  awareness  (SA)  on  conventional  routes  and  procedures  IAW  AFI  11-202V3 (T-2). 4.2.3.3.  Aircraft  equipped  with  Helicopter  Terrain  Awareness  Warning  System/Traffic Collision  Avoidance  Device  (HTAWS/TCAD)  modification  TCTO  1H-1(U)771  or 1(U)N(I)-505  are  approved  for  use  during  all  phases  of  flight  as  the  primary  means  of IFR/VFR navigation to include RNAV GPS Approaches. 4.2.3.4.  IFR  Training  Flights.    Aircrew  will  not  takeoff  unless  weather  is  equal  to  or greater  than  published  approach  minimums  (ceiling  and  visibility),  but  no  less  than  1/2 mile  (2,400  runway  visual  range  [RVR])  at  the  departure  airfield  for  scheduled  takeoff time plus one hour (T-2). 4.2.3.5.  IFR Operational Flights. 4.2.3.5.1.  Without a departure alternate, aircrew will not takeoff unless weather at the departure  airfield  is  equal  to  or  above  the  published  visibility  required  for  the appropriate aircraft category for an available approach (T-2). 4.2.3.5.2.  With  a  departure  alternate,  aircrew  will  not  takeoff  unless  weather  at  the departure  airfield  is  equal  to  or  above  one-half  the  published  visibility  minimum required for the appropriate aircraft category, but no less than 1/4 mile (1,200 RVR) for  an  available  approach  (T-2).    Weather  must  be  equal  to  or  above  published visibility minimum if aircrew use a copter-only approach at the departure airfield (T-2).  Pilots will select the departure alternate using the following criteria: (T-2). 4.2.3.5.2.1.  Departure alternate should be within one hour flying time (T-2). 4.2.3.5.2.2.  Weather  enroute  to  the  departure  alternate  permits  flight  within aircraft  limitations  and  complies  with  AFI  11-202V3,  Selecting  an  Alternate, Helicopter criteria.  The aircraft must be capable of maintaining minimum enroute altitudes (MEA) or minimum obstruction clearance altitude (MOCA), (whichever is higher) to the alternate if an engine fails (T-2). 4.2.3.5.3.  Life or Death Missions.  The Wing Commander (or equivalent) determines if a mission is a life or death situation.  During these missions, aircrew may take off if the visibility is sufficient to taxi to the takeoff area.  The AC ensures an appropriate course of action is available (and briefed) in the event of an emergency after takeoff (T-3). 4.3.  Adverse Weather  : 4.3.1.  If adverse weather is encountered, the AC will take immediate action to avoid further flight in hazardous conditions by either diverting or landing (T-2). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 13 4.3.2.  No  mission  requires  a  helicopter  to  penetrate  a  thunderstorm.  Aircrew  may  fly  into areas  of  known  or  forecast  thunderstorms  if  Visual  Meteorological  Conditions  (VMC)  are maintained and thunderstorm activity is avoided by a minimum of 5 nautical miles (NM) (T-2).  Aircrew will not fly into rain shafts beneath cumulonimbus clouds (T-2). 4.4.  Fuel Planning  : 4.4.1.  For  all  flights,  aircrew  will  plan  to  arrive  at  the  destination  with  a  minimum  of  200 pounds of reserve fuel (T-2). 4.4.2.  In  addition  to  landing  at  the  destination  with  the  required  reserve  fuel,  when  flying IFR  and  using  visibility-only  criteria  for  the  approach  or  when  destination  weather  may  be unreliable, aircrew will plan to use no less than 250 pounds of fuel for descent, approach, and missed approach (T-2). 4.5.  Altitude  Restrictions  .    Aircrew  will  conduct  all  operations  at  or  above  300  feet  Above Ground  Level  (AGL)  except  when  lower  altitudes  are  required  for  takeoff,  departure,  arrival, landing, operational missions, training flights in approved areas, approved exercise missions, or when directed lower by a FAA/National Aeronautical Charting Office (NACO) Helicopter Route Chart (T-2). 4.5.1.  For unaided night flight, aircrew will maintain an enroute altitude of 500 feet Above Highest  Obstacle  (AHO)  within  5  NM  of  the  flight  path  unless  directed  lower  by  a FAA/NACO Helicopter Route Chart (T-3). 4.5.2.  Operational Searches.  Altitudes are determined by the AC. 4.5.3.  Training  Searches.    For  search  training  below  300  feet  AGL,  aircrew  must  be  in  a surveyed low level area (T-3).  Aircrew will conduct day and NVG search training no lower than 100 feet AHO.  Aircrew will not conduct night unaided search training (T-3). 4.5.4.  Low-Level.    Flight  below  300  feet  AGL  is  considered  low-level.    Published FAA/NACO Helicopter Routes are not considered low-level. 4.5.4.1.  For  enroute  operations  over  land,  aircrew  will  fly  no  lower  than  50  feet  AHO during the day or at night with NVGs (T-2). 4.5.4.2.  During  enroute  flight  over  water, aircrew will fly no lower than 50 feet  Above Water Level (AWL) during the day or 150 feet AWL at night with NVGs (T-2). 4.6.  Low-Level  Flight.  Aircrew  will  only  conduct  low-level  training  in  a  surveyed  low-level flight  area  (T-2).    Specific  geographical  areas  such  as  missile  complexes  and  operational  areas may be designated as low-level flight areas.  Units will establish defined boundaries and meet the following requirements prior to any low-level flight: (T-2). 4.6.1.  Established  low-level  surveyed  routes  or  Low  Altitude  Tactical  Navigation  (LATN) areas.  MAJCOMs  will  establish  guidance  IAW  AFI  13-201,  Air  Force  Airspace Management (T-2). 4.6.2.  Units  will  annually  survey  all  helicopter  low-level  flight  areas  (T-2).    For  low-level flight areas, units will verify all man-made obstacles above 50 feet AGL (or commensurate with the lowest altitude flown within the area) and document all new man-made obstacles on the  master  chart  and  flight  charts  (T-2).    Annotate  the  survey  date  on  the  master  chart.  WARNING:  During low-level surveys, pay close attention to the possibility that wires may 14 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 be draped across a valley while the supporting poles are not visible from low-level navigation altitudes. 4.6.3.  If low-level helicopter flight operations have not been conducted in a designated area for  greater  than  six  months,  units  will  conduct  a  resurvey  before  any  low-level  training flights are conducted in the area (T-2). 4.7.  Illumination and NVG Requirements.  WARNING:  Lack of sufficient illumination may prevent  NVG  contour  operations  in  otherwise  VMC  conditions.    WARNING:  NVGs  worn  in very low illumination conditions can lead to induced motion illusions and spatial disorientation. 4.7.1.  NVG operations at any altitude require sufficient illumination to safely identify terrain and hazards commensurate with aircraft speed and altitude. 4.7.2.  The  decision  on  whether  sufficient  illumination  exists  to  complete  the  mission  rests with the AC. 4.7.3.  Due  to  increased  risk,  units  will  establish  an  additional  level  of  Operational  Risk Management  (ORM)  for  training  or  operational  flights  during  periods  of  low  effective illumination (T-2).  Low effective illumination is defined as less than 10% moon disk/moon illumination  on  a  clear,  cloudless  night  on  any  portion  of  the  route  of  flight.    ORM  and mission planning must consider cloud cover, visibility, moon angle, cultural lighting, etc. (T-3). 4.8.  Takeoff and Landing Data (TOLD). 4.8.1.  In  accordance  with  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1,  aircrew  will  complete  and  brief  TOLD  cards prior to  takeoff  (T-2). Compute data applicable to the mission profile.  For mission events, aircrew should complete a separate worst case TOLD card during pre-mission planning.  Tab Data is provided in T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 to facilitate computing TOLD while in flight.  TOLD may be computed using flight manual charts, Tab Data contained in T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL-1, or MAJCOM approved TOLD application for an approved Electronic Flight Bag (EFB). 4.8.2.  Aircrew  must  recalculate  and  brief  TOLD  for  approaches  if  conditions  become  less favorable (i.e., gross weight, pressure altitude, or temperature increase) (T-3). 4.8.3.  Aircrew  will  confirm  and  brief  TOLD  prior  to  beginning  approaches  when  power required  is  within  10%  of  power  available,  when  out-of-ground-effect  (OGE)  power  is  not available,  or  at  the  discretion  of  the  AC  (T-2).    Aircrew  will  post  the  TOLD  card  at  the discretion of the AC (T-2). 4.9.  Weight and Balance. 4.9.1.  The  AC,  or  designated  crewmember,  will  compute  crew/passenger/equipment  off- loading or on-loading to ensure center of gravity (CG) and weight limits are not exceeded (T-2).    Confirm  basic  aircraft  weight  and  moment  with  certified  DD  Form  365-3,  Weight  And Balance Record, Chart C – Basic.  These computations will address the maximum number of personnel/maximum  amount  of  equipment  allowed  in  the  cargo  compartment  without exceeding  CG  or  structural  limitations  (T-2).    This  procedure  applies  to  all  operations  in which  CG  or  weight  limits  may  be  exceeded  as  a  result  of  personnel/equipment  on  or  off-loading.    A  manual  or  electronic  DD  Form  365-4/Form  F,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance Form F – Tactical/Transport may be used.  MAJCOMs must approve any electronic system other than the Automated Weight and Balance System (AWBS) (T-2). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 15 4.9.2.  AWBS.  Use the most recent version of AWBS found on their official website.  Refer to  T.O.  1-1B-50,  Aircraft  Weight  and  Balance,  for  installation  requirements.    Use  the transport side of the form. 4.9.3.  Use  a  DD  Form  365-4/Form  F,  for  each  flight.    The  DD  Form  365-4  records  the weight,  moment,  and  CG  calculations  for  a  specific  loading  arrangement  on  a  specific aircraft to  ensure the aircraft remains  within its safe weight  and balance limitations.  These forms are prepared for use on a one-time basis. 4.9.3.1.  Standard Aircraft Configurations (Canned).  Aircraft configuration encompasses weight,  CG,  cabin  equipment/seating/personnel  layout,  and  mission  equipment  (i.e., Forward  Looking  Infra-red  (FLIR),  hoist,  life  raft,  cargo  hook,  Alternate  Insertion  and Extraction  [AIE]  devices,  guns,  etc.).    DD  Forms  365-4  may  be  prepared  for  standard aircraft  configurations  used  by  the  unit.    These  canned  forms  are  authorized  when  an aircraft’s weight, moment, and CG remain within limits found in T.O. 1H-1(U)N-5, Basic Weight  Checklist  and  Loading  Data.    These  forms  (either  computerized  or  expendable pad version) must be filed and maintained in both the primary and supplemental weight and balance handbooks (T-3).  Aircrew may use these forms only for the configurations they were designed/computed for, and units must check them for accuracy at least every 180 days (T-3). 4.9.4.  Initial Takeoff Gross Weight. 4.9.4.1.  If  the  initial  takeoff  condition  gross  weight  changes  by  more  than  500  lbs, aircrew must generate a new or corrected DD Form 365-4 (T-3). 4.9.4.2.  When initial  takeoff  condition  gross weight  does not  change by  more than 500 lbs,  then  a  new  or  corrected  DD  Form  365-4  need  not  be  generated.    Even  though  no written adjustments are required, aircrew will calculate the new gross weight and CG and ensure limits are not exceeded (T-2). 4.9.4.3.  Brief the AC on the new gross weight and CG prior to take-off, as required. 4.9.5.  Aircrew will make zero fuel weight computations on the DD Form 365-4 (T-2). 4.10.  Charts. 4.10.1.  Units  will  maintain  a  master  chart  depicting  the  low-level  flight  areas  for  flight planning purposes (T-2).  Units will annotate all man-made obstacles over 50 feet AGL (or commensurate  with  the  lowest  altitude  flown)  (T-2).    Additionally,  annotate  any  published low-level routes, no-fly areas, noise abatement areas, or other hazards within the boundaries.  Master charts will be updated monthly using the Chart Update Manual (CHUM) supplement (T-2).    The  date  of  the  CHUM  update  will  be  annotated  on  the  master  chart  (T-2).  Crewmembers should continuously scan for uncharted obstacles.  When uncharted obstacles are found, aircrew will temporarily suspend training and record appropriate information on to the  aircrew  chart  (location  and  approximate  height  AGL)  (T-3).    ACs  will  ensure  this information is immediately passed to appropriate supervisors upon landing (T-3). 4.10.2.  Units  will  ensure  charts  used  for  flying  reflect  the  same  information  as  the  master chart  (T-2).    Crewmembers  will  ensure  the  chart  is  updated  and  annotated  using  the  latest CHUM (T-2).  ACs will ensure a copy of the planned route or flight log/AF Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, is available at the unit (T-3). 16 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 4.11.  Route Planning  .  Aircrews will review and de-conflict low altitude charts for IFR, VFR, and  slow  speed  low  altitude  (IR,  VR,  and  SR)  training  routes  and  annotate  potential  conflict areas along the proposed routes during pre-mission planning (T-2). 4.12.  Over  Water.  The  aircraft  is  considered  “over  water”  anytime  it  is  not  in  a  position  to autorotate to the shore.  All altitude restrictions, power requirements, aircrew flight  equipment, and aircraft equipment requirements apply. 4.13.  Alert Aircraft.  Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows: 4.13.1.  Park  the  aircraft  in  a  designated  alert  parking  area/hangar  to  expedite  taxi  and takeoff. (T-3). 4.13.2.  Plan preflight validity periods to limit the need to update the preflight during an alert period.  Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, regardless of whether it has flown or not, a complete aircrew preflight and Acceptance Check is required (T-2). 4.13.3.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are met: (T-3). 4.13.3.1.  Alert  requirements  can  be  met  with  sufficient  fuel  to  meet  mission requirements (T-3). 4.13.3.2.  Communication contact is maintained with the primary controlling agency (T-3). 4.13.3.3.  Controlling  agencies  are  notified  any  time  the  alert  aircraft  departs  the  local area (T-3). 4.13.4.  Thru-Flight Inspections. 4.13.4.1.  IAW  T.O.  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance Inspection, Documentation,  Policies,  and  Procedures,  the  maintenance  thru-flight  inspection  is  a between flights inspection and will be accomplished after each flight when a turnaround sortie,  continuation  flight  or  continuation  of  alert  is  scheduled  and  a  basic  post-flight inspection  is  not  required  (T-2).    The  thru-flight  inspection  consists  of  checking  the aerospace  vehicle  for  flight  continuance  by  performing  visual  examination  and/or operational  checks  of  certain  components,  areas,  or  systems,  according  to  established T.O.s  to  ensure  that  no  defects  exist  which  would  be  detrimental  to  further  flight.    An alert  crewmember  or  other  UH-1N  aircrew  member  designated  by  the  Mission Commander will be present during the thru-flight inspection or at the completion of the thru-flight  inspection  to  ensure  all  cowlings/access  doors  are  secure  and  to  check  the areas in which the inspection and/or maintenance was performed (T-2). 4.13.5.  Aircrews will perform an Acceptance Check and Cocking Check (hoist and weapons inspections as applicable) to place the aircraft on alert status (T-2).  Once accepted for alert, make  the  following  entry  in  the  AFTO  FORM  781A,  Maintenance  Discrepancy  and  Work Document: - “Aircraft accepted for alert_______(time/date).  Acceptance Check, hoist check (as applicable), and weapons check (as applicable) performed.” IAW T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL1, an alert crewmember will be present whenever maintenance is performed  (T-2).  If an alert crewmember  is  not  available,  Mission  Commanders  may  authorize  another  UH-1N  aircrew member to check the area in which maintenance was performed and ensure the alert crew is briefed on the maintenance actions.  The check must be performed prior to flight (T-2). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 17 4.14.  Alert  Procedures.  Alert crews will conduct an aircrew briefing at the beginning of each alert period (T-2).  Alert crews are authorized to prepare TOLD and DD Form 365-4 using the worst  weather  conditions  expected  during  the  alert  period.    This  TOLD  will  be  used  only  for alert scrambles. If the alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, new TOLD will be accomplished (T-3).    Weather  and  TOLD  will  be  updated  and  briefed  at  least  once  each  24  hour  period  and also  when  conditions  change  significantly  or  are  forecasted  to  change  significantly  from  the original forecast (T-3). 4.14.1.  When an alert crew change occurs, and the same aircraft remains on alert, there is no requirement to perform another preflight.  Should the aircraft remain on alert for more than 72 hours, regardless if it has flown or not, complete another full Acceptance Check.  When an alert aircraft changes, the alert crew will perform Acceptance and Cocking Checks of the aircraft  (T-2).    If  the  alert  crew  is  not  available,  other  qualified  aircrew  may  perform  the Preflight, Acceptance, and Cocking Checklists at the Mission Commander’s discretion. 18 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 5 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES 5.1.

All aircrew  will  maintain  current  copies  of  all  flight  publications  (electronic  or  paper  copy)  listed under  Publications  Check  in  AFI  11-2UH-1NV2,  UH-1N  Aircrew  Evaluation  Criteria  (T-2).  Crewmembers may omit checklist pages not applicable to their unit operations as determined by the unit commander (T-3). Insert current, approved flight manual checklists in the USAF flight crew checklist binder or electronically in an approved EFB  (T-3).  Additional notes amplifying checklist  procedures  and  limitations  may  be  added.    Currency  of  notes  is  the  crewmember’s responsibility. 5.2.1.  Copies of the Before Takeoff, Before Landing, Hoist Operators Before Pickup, Hoist Operator’s  After  Pickup,  Smoke/Flare  Drop,  Scramble,  and  Weapons  System  Emergency checklists may be posted in the cockpit and/or cabin at the discretion of the unit (T-3). 5.3.  Mission  Kits.  Unit commanders may supplement the minimum  contents of the kit shown in Table 5.1.  Items carried by crewmembers or stored on the aircraft need not be duplicated in the mission kit.  A mission kit is required for all flights except on FCFs (T-3).  During FCFs, a copy of the T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1 and T.O. 1H-1 (U)N-6CF-1, Acceptance and Functional Checklist Procedures, is required on board (T-3).  FLIP shall include coverage for entire area of planned operations  (T-3).    Any  aircrew  member’s  EFB  that  has  all  mission  kit  contents  may  act  as  the mission kit,  with the following exceptions: AF Form 70;  AF Form 457;  USAF Hazard Report; AF Form 651, Hazardous Air Traffic Report (HATR); SF44, Purchase Order-Invoice-Voucher; AFI 11-2UH-1NV3 CL-1; and T.O. 1H-1(U)N-1CL-1 will be on board as paper copies (T-3). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 19 Table 5.1.

A current chart consists of the most recent edition available with updates from the Chart Updating Manual posted on it and annotated as such.  ACs will ensure HTAWS database in the aircraft is current prior to flight (T-2).  Unit Commanders will ensure procedures are in place to maintain the currency of HTAWS databases on unit assigned aircraft (T-3). 5.5.  Minimum  Aircraft  Equipment  and  Instrumentation.  Minimum  aircraft  equipment  and instrumentation is listed in Table 5.2.  Additional information can be found in AFI 11-202V3 and AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting. 5.5.1.  In addition to requirements in AFI 11-202V3, the final decision regarding equipment required for a mission rests with the AC.  When the AC considers an item essential for the accomplishment of the mission, the AC will designate the component mission-essential and it will be repaired or replaced prior to departure (T-3).  Acceptance of an aircraft by an AC to operate  one  mission  (or  mission  segment)  without  an  item  or  system  does  not  commit  that AC or a different AC to subsequent operations with the same items/systems inoperative. 5.5.2.  Radar Altimeter.  Two operational radar altimeters are required for all low-level flight.  At  least  one  radar  altimeter  must  be  operational  for  night  operations  (aided  and  unaided) below 500 feet AHO (T-2). 5.5.3.  Water  Operations  Training.    Crews  conducting  water  training  sorties  may  use  a helicopter covership or safety boat in lieu of carrying a life raft for non open-ocean training (T-2). 20 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 5.5.3.1.  Helicopter  Covership  Requirements.    Helicopter  coverships  will  maintain constant line-of-sight communications with deploying helicopter at all times and remain within 5 NM  (T-2).   Coverships will be equipped with  an operable hoist or carry  a life raft for deployment (T-2). 5.5.3.2.  Cover  (Safety)  Boat  Procedures.    The  boat  party  and  helicopter  will  maintain positive  visual  contact  at  all  times  and  minimize  the  distance  between  the  boat  and deploying  team  to  ensure  prompt  response  (T-2).    All  live  swimmer  water  operations require  positive  radio  contact  (T-2).    If  radios  are  unavailable  or  inoperable,  swimmer team lead will carry an overt and pre-briefed emergency signal (T-2). Table 5.2.  Minimum Aircraft Equipment and Instrumentation.

At least one operative, on whichever side is occupied by the AC. 2.  2.  As required for flight profile. 3.  3.  At least one operational. 4.  4.  If infrared filter installed on the searchlight, the landing light must be operational (T-2). 5.  5.  IMC flight requires two operative ADI’s. 6.  6.    Life  rafts  are  not  required  for  non-open  ocean  water  training  sorties  when  cover  is provided by a boat  or hoist  equipped helicopter.  See paragraph 5.5.3 for covership/safety boat requirements. 5.6.  Restraint  Devices.  When  rotors  are  engaged,  at  least  the  pilot  on  the  controls  will  have his/her seat belt and shoulder harness fastened and secured (T-2).  All crewmembers will wear a seat  belt  when  conducting  practice  emergency  procedures  (T-2).    All  occupants  in  the  cabin AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 21 compartment will wear a seat belt, authorized restraint device, or parachute when doors are open during flight (T-2). 5.6.1.  With the cabin doors closed, the AC may direct crewmembers to perform duties in the cabin unrestrained for brief periods when required to don harnesses, attend to passengers, or change  seats  (T-3).    Parachutists  may  change  positions  with  doors  open  if  parachutes  are worn and the aircraft is higher than 1,000 feet AGL (T-3). 5.6.2.  For  alternate  loading  of  passengers  and  crewmembers,  refer  to  AFTTP  3-3.H-1, Combat Aircraft Fundamentals—H-1. 5.6.3.  The AC may direct crewmembers to perform duties requiring the use of a MAJCOM approved  restraint  device  in  lieu  of  a  seat  and  seat  belt  when  mission  requirements  dictate.  Attach the restraint device to any tie down ring on the floor or to any seat belt ring as long as the seat belt is not simultaneously in use (does not prevent crewmember from attaching their restraint device to their own seat belt ring) (T-2).  Only one restraint device can be attached to a tie down ring at the same time (T-2).  Do not attach the restraint device to cargo tie down rings  on  the  bulkhead  or  ceiling.    Adjust  the  length  of  the  restraint  device  to  preclude accidental exit from the aircraft (T-2).  WARNING: An improperly adjusted restraint device may result in injury or loss of life. 5.6.4.  If a valid mission requirement exists, in lieu of seat belts, ACs may permit OSFs and MEPs  to  be  restrained  with  a  MAJCOM  approved  restraint  device.    ACs  must  ensure  that these personnel are thoroughly familiar with the use of restraint devices and are fully briefed on all pertinent safety considerations (T-3). 5.7.  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Data  Document  .    A  crewmember  must  review  all  applicable aircraft  forms,  AFTO  Forms  781,  before  applying  power  to  the  aircraft  or  operating  aircraft systems  (T-2).    An  authorized  maintenance  person,  if  available,  or  the  AC  must  sign  the exceptional/conditional release before flight (T-2).  Ensure the AIR card and DD Form 1896, Jet Fuel Identaplate, are aboard the aircraft. 5.8.  Communications Policy  : 5.8.1.  Primary Radio.  The AC will tell the crew which radio is the primary radio (T-2).  All crewmembers  will  monitor  the  primary  radio  unless  specifically  directed  otherwise  by  the AC (T-2). 5.8.2.  Intercom.  All crewmembers will listen to  the intercom  (T-2).  Clearance is required from the AC prior to switching off the intercom.  During critical phases of flight, intra-plane transmissions  will  be  limited  to  those  essential  for  crew  coordination  (T-2).    Note:  Avoid discussing classified information on intercom.  If classified discussion is necessary, ensure all wafer switches are in the Internal Communications System (ICS) position.  Also ensure the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) Mute Switch and FLIR Recorder Mute switch are on. 5.9.  Dual Engine Power Available Check  . 5.9.1.  Perform the power check as near as possible to the same Pressure Altitude (PA) and Outside Air Temperature (OAT) as the operating area.  Slowly apply collective pitch without drooping  Nr  below  97  percent  until  computed  power  or  a  limit  (as  defined  by  the  flight manual, section 5) is  reached.  The engines need to produce power equal to or greater than computed from the power available charts in the flight manual.  If the engines fail to produce 22 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 computed power or Nr droops below 97 percent prior to reaching computed power or a limit, terminate the sortie.  Perform a dual engine power available check for: 5.9.1.1.  Operations  below  300  feet  AGL  (except  when  operating  on  routes  depicted  on published FAA/NACO Helicopter Route Charts) 5.9.1.2.  Unprepared Landing Area Operations 5.9.1.3.  Search Operations 5.9.1.4.  Cargo Sling Operations 5.9.1.5.  AIE Operations 5.9.1.6.  Water Operations 5.10.  Single  Engine  Power  Available  Check  .    Ensure  torque  is  below  single  engine  power available.  Gradually roll one throttle back to flight idle while monitoring the engine instruments to  ensure  the  other  engine  is  able  to  produce  adequate  power  to  sustain  flight.    Slowly  apply collective pitch without drooping Nr below 97 percent until computed power available or a limit (as defined by the flight manual, Section 5) is reached.  If the engine fails to produce computed power or Nr droops below 97 percent prior to reaching computed power or a limit, terminate the sortie. 5.11.  Power  Required.  All  primary  flight  crewmembers  are  required  to  know  the  power margin for intended operations.  Power available versus power required will be briefed prior to final approach (T-2).  For multiple approaches to the same area, power available/power required will  be  briefed  for  the  applicable  landing/AIE  with  the  smallest  power  margin  (T-2).    Updates will be briefed if gross weight or temperatures increase (T-2). 5.11.1.  Comparing  power  available  with  highest  power  required  (landing/takeoff/AIE) determines  power  margin.    This  is  the  excess  power  available  for  go-around  or  unforeseen conditions (e.g., wind shifts, null areas, etc.).  When the power margin is 10 percent or less, a second aircrew member will re-compute TOLD to confirm power requirements (T-2). 5.11.2.  Consider that power available at the site may differ from power available in flight if temperature or PA differs.  Reaccomplish power check if conditions change from worst case which will result in a decrease in power available. 5.11.3.  Prior  to  landing,  ensure  that  sufficient  power  to  depart  the  planned  landing  site  is available.  Factor in any weight that will be added at the site (e.g., survivors). 5.11.4.  If sufficient power is not available for the approach, landing and/or departure, lighten the helicopter, locate a more suitable landing site, or abort the mission. 5.11.5.  Landing Zone Power Requirements: 5.11.5.1.  Clear Escape  Route.  The minimum  power available required  for areas with  a clear escape route is computed hover power for the intended hover height at the landing location (T-3). 5.11.5.2.  Restricted  Escape  Route.    The  minimum  power  available  required  for  areas with a restricted escape route is computed OGE hover power for the landing location (T-3). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 23 5.11.5.3.  Water Operations.  Minimum power available required for water operations is computed OGE hover power (T-3). 5.11.5.4.  Restricted  Visibility  Approach:  Any  time  the  pilot  flying  anticipates  losing ground  references  due  to  sand,  dust,  snow,  or  other  obscurations,  the  minimum  power available must be hover power + 5% for the intended hover height (T-3). 5.11.5.5.  When landing to a surface area equal to or smaller than the rotor diameter, such as a pinnacle or ridgeline, computed OGE hover power must be available (T-3). 5.12.  Engine  Running  Crew  Change.  For  engine  running  crew  changes,  the  new  AC  will review the AFTO Forms 781, aircraft weight and balance, configuration, and TOLD (T-2). 5.13.  Fuel Management. 5.13.1.  Preflight.  The AC, or designated crewmember, will ensure the pre-planned fuel load is  on  board  the  aircraft  and  will  brief  the  crew  on  fuel  loads  that  do  not  meet  mission requirements (T-2). 5.13.2.  In  flight.    The  AC,  or  designated  crewmember,  will  monitor  fuel  transfer  and  fuel consumption and keep the crew advised of fuel status (T-2). 5.14.  Forced  or  Precautionary  Landings.  Aircraft security  and accessibility for maintenance are  secondary  considerations  to  aircrew  safety.    Report  all  precautionary  landings  through appropriate channels as soon as communications are established. 5.14.1.  Forced or Precautionary Landings due to In-flight Malfunction. 5.14.1.1.  Aircraft  malfunctions  must  be  investigated,  corrected,  and  inspected  by qualified  maintenance  personnel  (T-2).    Coordinate  maintenance  support  via  radio, telephone,  or  any  other  means  available.    The  OG/CC,  MXG/CC,  or  designated representative  (cannot  be  delegated  below  unit  Director  of  Operations  [DO])  is  the approval authority required prior to further flight when the precautionary landing occurs at a location where qualified maintenance is not available. 5.14.1.2.  In  the  event  a  forced  or  precautionary  landing  occurs  at  a  location  where communications  are  not  available,  and  the  AC  determines  the  aircraft  is  safe  for  flight, the  AC  may  authorize  further  flight.    The  decision  to  resume  flight  under  these circumstances  must  be  based  on  a  thorough  evaluation  of  all  the  hazards  and  risks involved (T-2). 5.14.2.  Precautionary Landings Due to Weather. 5.14.2.1.  If  deteriorating  weather  is  encountered  during  VFR  operations,  consider  a precautionary landing a viable option in addition to course reversal, course deviation, or continuing under IFR. 5.14.2.2.  The AC may authorize further flight after a precautionary landing for weather.  Make a reasonable effort to notify appropriate agencies of the precautionary landing and to determine additional weather information. 5.15.  Obstacle Clearance.  Prior to maneuvering the helicopter in close proximity to obstacles, the aircrew will ascertain that the area is clear (T-3).  Whenever horizontal rotor clearance is 25 feet  or  less,  the  scanner  will  inform  the  pilot  of  the  clock  position  relative  to  the  nose  of  the 24 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 aircraft and estimated distance to the obstacle from the edge of the tip path plane (for example: “Tree, nine o’clock, 20 feet”) (T-3). 5.16.  Fire  Guard.  A  fire  guard  will  be  used,  when  available,  for  all  engine  starts  (T-3).    If  a wheeled  extinguisher  is  not  available,  the  fire  guard  will  have  a  hand-held  fire  extinguisher readily available (T-3).  Should a fire occur, the fire guard’s primary duty is to assist the crew in evacuating the aircraft, not fight the fire at the engine compartment. 5.17.  Refueling Duties  .  Aircrew members certified in refueling may perform refueling duties.  Crewmembers used as refueling supervisors/panel operators will comply with T.O. 00- 25-172, Ground  Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static  Grounding/Bonding  and  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-2-1  CL-2,  to max  extent  possible  (T-3).    At  locations  with  refueling  support,  aircrews  will  not  refuel  unless extenuating circumstances dictate (T-3).  When not directly involved in the refueling operation, personnel  will  remain  at  least  50  feet  from  the  refuel  operation  and/or  any  pressurized  fuel carrying servicing component (T-3). 5.17.1.  The  AIR  Card  is  used  to  pay  for  services  at  commercial  Fixed  Base  Operators (FBO).  These include aviation fuel, aircraft oil and fluids or other minor maintenance items.  Charges incurred during this routine aircraft servicing generate a charge receipt.  The AC is responsible  for  ensuring  the  receipt  is  correct  and  all  appropriate  signatures  are  obtained before  departing  the  FBO.    Log  refuel  information  on  the  AF  Form  664,  Aircraft  Fuels Documentation  Log,  and  AFTO  Form  781H,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Flight  Status  and Maintenance,  located  in  the  aircraft  781  forms  binder  IAW  T.O.  00-20-1.    The  AC  then ensures that all charge receipts are transferred to the unit document control officer (DCO) at the completion of the mission. 5.17.2.  Charges incurred for other services, including landing fees, aircraft de-icing, follow-me trucks, and other airfield related services might not generate a receipt that is given to the aircrew.  If no receipt for the services is generated and provided to the aircrew, the AC will ensure the location and services performed are noted (AF Form 664 meets this requirement) and relayed to the unit DCO when the receipts are turned in upon mission completion (T-3).  If a separate receipt is generated, turn it in to the unit DCO. 5.17.3.  In  the  event  the  AIR  Card  is  not  accepted  aircrew  will  use  the  Standard  Form  44 (SF44) for payment purposes (T-3).  The aircrew shall complete the SF 44 and attach it to the merchant vendor ticket/invoice when the merchant also declines use of the SF 44 and uses its own  invoice/receipt  (T-3).    Fuel  purchases  shall  be  documented  on  a  separate  SF  44  from ground  services  and  other  authorized  products,  since  the  merchant  must  invoice  Defense Energy  Support  Center  (DESC)  for  the  fuel  portion  of  the  invoice  and  the  customer  home station payment office for any non-fuel product and services (T-3). 5.18.  Minor  Maintenance  Actions.  When  authorized  by  the  terms  of  the  Performance  Work Statement  in  the  maintenance  contract,  MAJCOMs  may  train  and  certify  Flight  Engineers  in Minor Maintenance actions using an approved syllabus.  After certification, Flight Engineers are authorized  to  remove  access  panels,  remove,  inspect,  and  install  chip  detectors,  reset  cannon plugs,  reset  circuit  breakers/voltage  regulators,  and  service  fluid  levels  when  away  from  home station to allow continued mission execution or return flight for maintenance actions (T-3). 5.18.1.  ACs will inspect minor maintenance action performed by certified Flight Engineers and sign off red-X prior to flight (T-3). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 25 5.18.2.  Certified Flight  Engineers will have  a tool  kit on board for all flights  departing the local  traffic  pattern  (T-3).    Individual  units  will  establish  requirements  for  tools/parts  to  be included in these kits (T-3).  As a minimum, the kit will include enough tools to remove and install chip detectors. Supplement accountability procedures per MAJCOM guidance (T-2). 5.19.  Cabin  Security.  During  preflight  inspections,  pay  particular  attention  to  panels  and components  that  are  potential  dropped  objects.    Air  crew  must  secure  all  cargo/mission equipment  inside  the  aircraft  prior  to  any  aircraft  movement  (T-3).          WARNING:  Loose objects can become hazardous projectiles during any violent maneuver or hard landing and must be secured to prevent injury to personnel and/or damage to the aircraft. (T-2). 5.20.  Standard Configurations.  Standard configurations will be IAW MAJCOM and unit local procedures (supplement or operating instruction) (T-2).  Each flying unit will publish diagrams and mission equipment lists for each configuration used by the unit (T-2).  Prepare a DD Form 365-4  IAW  paragraph  4.9  for  each  of  these  configurations  (T-3).    Additional  special  mission equipment may be added at the option of the unit commander (T-3).  All equipment authorized for  and  installed  on  the  aircraft  will  be  categorized  and  managed  IAW  applicable  Air  Force Instructions  (T-2).    Aircraft  will  not  be  modified  to  secure  and/or  install  equipment  unless authorized by aircraft technical orders or applicable Air Force Instructions (T-2). 5.20.1.  Cargo/Equipment.    Securing  life  support/medical  equipment/medical  kits  with  seat belts  is  authorized.  In  addition,  items  weighing  less  than  200  pounds  that  require  constant access,  such  as  navigation  or  mission  kits,  may  be  secured  with  seat  belts.    Secure cargo/equipment items not requiring rapid removal during an aircraft or medical emergency with devices identified in T.O. 13C2-1, Cargo Tie-Down Equipment, and the flight manual.  Do not modify tie down devices in any fashion. 5.20.2.  Deployment/Exercise  Configuration.    Every  effort  will  be  made  to  establish  the standard  configuration(s)  prior  to  deployment/exercise  participation  (T-3).    In  lieu  of  an exercise  coordinator,  the  mission  commander  will  establish  the  standard  configuration  for each  planned  mission  (T-3).    The  configuration(s)  may  be  altered  to  carry  additional observers,  ferry  simulated  survivors,  etc.    Survival  equipment  required  by  MAJCOM  or multi-command guidance will be included in these configurations (T-3). 5.20.3.  Deviations.    Unit  commanders  may  authorize  deviations  from  the  standard configuration.    Deviations  from  tactical  configuration  requirements  are  authorized  at deployment locations (including exercises) when the mission dictates. 5.20.4.  FCF Configuration.  Unit commanders may establish standard FCF configurations as required. 5.20.5.  Discrepancies.   Document all standard configuration discrepancies using the  AFTO Form 781A. 5.21.  Alternate  Insertion/Extraction  Operations  (AIE).  Reference  AFTTP  3-3.H-1  for additional  information.    WARNING:  For  all  AIE  operations,  it  is  the  AC's  responsibility  to ensure  all  crewmembers  are  aware  of  the  length  of  the  rope(s).    Failure  to  do  so  may  result  in serious injury to deploying personnel and/or damage to the aircraft.  WARNING: Devices used for  non-live  AIE  training  will  be  clearly  distinguishable  from  operational  equipment  (T-2).  Training devices will be configured the same as operational equipment (T-2).  Only operational equipment will be used for live AIE operations (T-2).  WARNING: UH-1N crews will not use 26 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 the rope ladder for emergency extraction of personnel unless the threat to personnel remaining on the ground is higher than the risk associated with the in-flight rope ladder failure (T-2).  If used in  forward  flight,  altitude  will  be  the  absolute  minimum  required,  airspeed  will  not  exceed  30 (Knots Indicated Airspeed) KIAS, and crews will continually assess the risk and the possibility for rope ladder failure (T-2). 5.21.1.  Live Hoist Training.  Accomplish live hoist training at the minimum altitude required to  accomplish  desired  training,  but  in  no  case  higher  than  40  feet  AGL  (T-3).    Live  hoist operations  may  be  performed  at  higher  altitudes  with  Sq/CC  or  DO  approval  when conducting a Search and Rescue exercise (T-3). 5.21.1.1.  Hoist Hook Safety/ Retaining Pin Procedures.  To prevent dropping the rescue device, use the hoist hook safety/retaining pin for all ground recoveries.  When raising or lowering an empty Stokes litter or rescue strop, the use of the hoist hook safety/retaining pin is not required.  This allows easier removal of litter cables, or attachment of one/both sides  of  the  rescue  strop  when  used,  from  the  hoist  hook.    Ensure  the  hoist  hook safety/retaining pin is installed prior to hoisting the litter, or strop, with a survivor. 5.21.1.2.  Unit  commanders  or  DOs  must  approve  hoist  riders  for  training  (T-3).    Any military  member  or  DOD  civilian  may  serve  in  a  survivor  role  and  ride  the  hoist.  Personnel not familiar with AIE operations will complete familiarization training with a Flight Engineer prior to flight or require a qualified observer on the ground during hoist operations (T-2).  This requirement may be met by lowering a qualified crewmember to the ground to assist the survivor/personnel not familiar with AIE ops (T-3). 5.21.1.3.  Hoist  Exercise  Procedures.    Exercises  are  distinct  from  currency  training.  Exercises are designed to add elements of realism not normally provided during currency training.  The following are special provisions for exercises: 5.21.1.3.1.  Select a clear recovery area to enhance speed and safety and to allow the helicopter to land or use the extraction device from as low a hover altitude as possible and/or practical.  If a recovery is to be accomplished from a forested area, the foliage must  be  sparse  enough  to  ensure  the  survivor  will  not  be  dragged  through  the branches  (T-2).    When  practical,  select  areas  with  trees  of  a  minimum  height  to decrease recovery time and provide additional safety for the survivor in the event of a hoist or other equipment malfunction. 5.21.1.3.2.  Other exercise personnel.  Every practical effort will be made to recover other  exercise  personnel  by  landing  (T-2).    They  may  be  recovered  by  hoist  if  the remaining  range  time  prevents  movement  of  these  personnel  to  a  suitable  landing area, or when an extended period of time is required to reach a suitable landing area.  These personnel will be briefed to select an area within a reasonable distance that will allow the helicopter to hover as low as practical (T-2). 5.21.2.  Rope  Ladder Operations.  The maximum number of personnel  on the ladder at  any one time is three. 5.21.3.  AIE  Storage  and  Maintenance.    Units  will  develop  a  program  to  ensure  all  unit-owned  equipment  is  tracked,  maintained  and  serviceable  (T-2).    As  a  minimum  units  must ensure  compliance  with  current  manufacturer  procedures  (T-2).    Units  will  document  these procedures per MAJCOM guidance. AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 27 5.22.  Weapons  Employment:  Units will ensure that weapon systems  employment  procedures and training standards are included in the unit weapons and tactics training program (T-2).  Refer to  AFI  11-214,  Air  Operations  Rules  and  Procedures,  AFTTP  3-3.H-1,  and  local  range procedures/restrictions  for  guidance.    Units  will  ensure  that  detailed  local  weapons  procedures are documented per MAJCOM guidance (T-2). 5.23.  Armed  Crewmembers.  Squadron  commanders  may  direct  arming  of  crewmembers  as deemed  necessary  by  mission  threat  analysis  (T-3).    During  all  operations  with  an  aircraft weapon system on board, an aircrew member will be armed  (T-2).  Protect these weapons, and other installed weapons, in compliance with AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of force by Air Force Personnel, and AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense.  If a crewmember is armed for the sole purpose of providing security for an aircraft weapon system, they may be armed with any approved Air Force sidearm (T-2). 5.24.  Armed Passengers.  The AC is the final approving authority for armed passengers.  At the discretion of the AC, a crewmember may collect, secure, and transport weapons for passengers who are authorized to carry them. 5.25.  Aircraft Lighting:  Aircraft lighting will be IAW AFI 11-202V3 (T-2). 5.26.  Aircraft Lighting for NVG Operations. 5.26.1.  An operable white light (landing or search) is required for all NVG flights (T-2). 5.26.2.  Position lights will be set to steady/bright for NVG flights (T-2). 5.26.3.  Use  of  one  anti-collision  light  is  permitted.    The  anti-collision  light(s)  may  be extinguished and the position lights set to dim, if it creates a hazard to the aircrew IAW AFI 11-202V3. 5.26.4.  An operable searchlight equipped with an infrared filter is required for NVG flights when effective illumination (regardless of methodology or measurement) is below 20 percent and is highly recommended for all NVG flights. 5.26.5.  During  NVG  formation  operations  in  aircraft  that  have  not  undergone  the  NVIS modification, pull the NAV LTS and FUS LTS circuit breakers and apply tape over the tail lights as necessary. 5.26.6.  Interior Lighting/Configuration. 5.26.6.1.  For  aircraft  not  modified  with  TCTO  1H-1(U)N-738,  MODIFICATION  OF THE  NVG  INTERIOR  COCKPIT  AND  EXTERIOR  LIGHTING  ON  UH-1N HELICOPTERS, the only NVG cockpit modifications currently approved for use on UH-1N  helicopters  are:  blue-filtered  secondary  instrument  lights,  NVG  compatible  Master Caution  segment  panel,  NVG  compatible  peanut  lights,  NVG  compatible  flip  filters  for the Master Caution and Revolutions Per Minute (RPM) warning lights, NVG compatible filters on the overhead pilot and copilot map lights, NVG compatible bulb replacements for the fire pull handle lights, an NVG compatible filter that can be temporarily mounted over  the  Master  Caution  segment  light  panel,  the  chip  detector  caution  panel,  the  fuel system  caution  panel,  gooseneck (NSN  1680-01-230-0533)  and  any permanent/temporary  modification  that  has  been  approved  in  writing  by  the  UH-1N System Program Office (SPO).  At a minimum, all helicopters will be equipped with the blue filtered secondary instrument lights (T-2). lights 28 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 5.26.6.2.  Aircrew  should  tape  all  lights  that  are  not  NVG  compatible.    Ensure  critical information  is  not  rendered invisible by  excessive taping.   The tape must allow  enough light  to  be  emitted  to  alert  the  pilot  of  critical  information.    Note:  Use  of  lip  or  finger lights to illuminate gauges in lieu of secondary lights is not authorized. 5.26.7.  Over  water  flights.    All  cockpit  and  cabin  emergency  exits  will  be  marked  by chemical lights, which will be activated prior to flight over water (T-2).  The chemical lights will be placed inside the cockpit and cabin compartment as follows: (T-2). 5.26.7.1.  Center one light immediately above each cockpit and cabin door. 5.26.7.2.  Attach one light to each cabin window emergency release handle (when doors are closed). 5.26.7.3.  Attach one light to the handle of each cockpit door and cargo door (when doors are closed). 5.26.7.4.  Attach one light to the life raft. 5.27.  Maintenance Debriefing  .  The AC or representative will debrief maintenance personnel on  the  condition  of  the  aircraft  and  equipment  following  flight  (T-2).    The  AC  will  make  the following entries in the AFTO Form 781A, when appropriate: (T-2). 5.27.1.  Aircraft subject to salt spray when flown below 3,000 feet over salt water. 5.27.2.  Aircraft flown below 30 feet above salt water. 5.27.3.  Hoist and rescue device used.  Specify the length of cable used, the particular device used, and if they were used in salt water. 5.27.4.  Aircraft flown through volcanic ash. AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 29 Chapter 6 TRANSITION AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES TRAINING 6.1.  Prohibited  Training  Maneuvers.  In  addition  to  T.O.  1H-1(U)N-1  restrictions,  aircrew will not intentionally accomplish the following maneuvers in the aircraft: (T-2). 6.1.1.  Actual in-flight engine shutdown (T-2). 6.1.2.  Blade stall and power settling (T-2). 6.1.3.  Dual fuel control failures (T-2). 6.1.4.  Dual hydraulic system failures (T-2). 6.1.5.  Dual  engine  forced  landing  (i.e.,  the  surprise  approach  to  conditions  leading  to  an autorotation by intentionally rolling both throttles to flight idle unannounced) (T-2). 6.1.6.  Hovering autorotation (T-2). 6.1.7.  Touchdown autorotations (T-2). 6.2.  Training Requirements: 6.2.1.  Special  Restrictions.    Unusual  attitude  training  and  emergency  procedure  training involving  engines  (to  include  simulated  autorotations),  engine  fuel  systems,  or  hydraulic systems will be accomplished only: (T-2). 6.2.1.1.  During visual meteorological conditions (T-2). 6.2.1.2.  After  official  sunrise/prior  to  official  sunset  (extended  daylight  hours  may  be authorized  by  MAJCOM).    Night  Emergency  Procedures  may  be  authorized  by MAJCOMS and procedures will be addressed in MAJCOM Supplements (T-2). 6.2.1.3.  During training, currency, or evaluation flights (T-2). 6.2.1.4.  When passengers are not on board (T-2). 6.2.1.5.  When  an  instructor  pilot  (IP)/flight  evaluator  pilot  (EP)  is  designated  on  the flight  orders  under  Duty  Position  as  IP  or  EP  and  occupies  a  pilot  seat  with  a  set  of controls (T-2). 6.2.2.  Unusual  Attitude  Training.    Entry  must  be  at  or  above  1,000  feet  AGL  (T-2).  Simulated  unusual  attitude  training  will  not  exceed  30  degrees  of  bank,  a  20  degrees  nose high attitude, or 10 degrees nose low attitude (T-2). 6.3.  Slide  landing  training  areas.  Local  slide  landing  training  areas  are  used  for  emergency and normal procedure maneuvers (e.g., single engine).  Minimum dimensions will be IAW UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning and Design (T-2). 6.3.1.  The AC will accomplish the following: (T-2). 6.3.1.1.  Brief the hazards of the slide landing area prior to commencing any maneuvers (T-2). 6.3.1.2.  Visually inspect the slide area for hazards and surface condition (N/A for active runways and active taxiways at airports with an active control tower) (T-2). 30 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 6.3.1.3.  If  the  visual  inspection  was  inconclusive,  test  the  surface  prior  to  commencing emergency  procedures  by  accomplishing  a  slide  landing.    Accomplish  a  slide  landing with both throttles at full open to determine its slide characteristics (T-2). 6.3.1.4.  If the slide area is not safe, discontinue training or go to a suitable slide or hard surface area (T-2). 6.3.1.5.  Hard surface areas such as runways, taxiways, or ramp areas may be used if free of obstacles/hazards (T-2). 6.4.  Airport  Rescue  and  Fire  Fighting  (ARFF).  Units  will  establish  procedures  to  ensure ARFF support is readily available during emergency procedure training (T-2).  Aircrews will not accomplish simulated emergency procedures while operating at civil airfields unless  authorized in a letter of agreement (LOA) (T-2). 6.5.  Maneuver Parameters. 6.5.1.  Traffic Pattern.  If a rectangular pattern is flown, aircrew should fly the downwind leg at  500  feet  AGL  and  90  KIAS.    During  the  turn  to  base,  aircrew  will  descend  to  300  feet AGL and slow the aircraft to 70 KIAS (T-3).  These altitudes will be used whenever possible if local conditions permit, otherwise comply with appropriate local traffic patterns (T-3). 6.5.2.  Normal Takeoff.  The pilot flying will initiate from the ground or hover using 5-foot hover  power  plus  10  percent  (T-3).    The  pilot  flying  will  terminate  the  maneuver  when reaching minimum safe single engine airspeed (or 70 KIAS if safe single engine airspeed is not available or as directed by the AC) (T-3).  Note: A normal takeoff should minimize time in the AVOID area of the height-velocity diagram. 6.5.3.  Marginal Power Takeoff.  The pilot flying will initiate from the ground or hover using 5-foot hover power  (T-3).  Simulate a 50-foot obstacle.  The pilot  flying  will terminate the maneuver  when  clear  of  the  simulated  obstacle  and  above  minimum  safe  single  engine airspeed (or 70 KIAS if safe single engine airspeed is not available or as directed by the AC) (T-3). 6.5.4.  Maximum Performance Takeoff.  The pilot flying will initiate from the ground or 5-foot hover using 5-foot hover power plus 10 to 15 percent or as specified by the IP/EP (T-3).  Simulate a 100-foot obstacle (T-3).  The pilot flying will terminate the maneuver when clear of the simulated obstacle and above minimum safe single engine airspeed (or 70 KIAS if safe single engine airspeed is not available or as directed by the AC) (T-3). 6.5.5.  Slide Takeoff.  The pilot  flying will initiate from  the ground using approximately 5-foot hover power minus 5 percent (T-3).  The pilot flying will terminate the maneuver when at  minimum  safe  single  engine  airspeed  (or  70  KIAS  if  safe  single  engine  airspeed  is  not available) (T-3). 6.5.6.  Normal Approach.  The pilot flying will initiate the approach from approximately 300 feet AGL and 70 KIAS using a 30° apparent angle (T-3).  The pilot flying will terminate the approach at a touchdown or 5-foot hover (T-3). 6.5.7.  Steep Approach.    The pilot  flying will initiate the  approach from approximately 300 feet AGL and an apparent 30 Knots Ground Speed (KGS) using a 45° apparent angle (T-3).  The  pilot  flying  will  terminate  the  approach  at  a  touchdown  or  5-foot  hover  (T-3).  WARNING:    During  approaches  at  less  than  40  KIAS,  do  not  exceed  800  feet  per  minute AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 31 descent rate.  If descent rate exceeds 800 feet per minute at less than 40 KIAS, aircrew will execute a “go-around.” (T-2). 6.5.8.  Shallow Approach.  The pilot flying will initiate the approach from approximately 300 feet  AGL  and  70  KIAS  using  a  10°  apparent  angle  (T-3).    The  pilot  flying  will  terminate approach at a touchdown or 5-foot hover (T-3). 6.6.  Emergency Procedures Training 6.6.1.  Manual Fuel Operations.  The IP may simulate fuel control malfunction indications at any time.   If aircrew accomplish the Fuel Control System Actuation Checklist in flight, the aircraft must be at a minimum of 500 feet AGL and 70 KIAS before initiating step 1 of the checklist  (T-3).    The  pilot  flying  will  ensure  collective  setting  is  below  computed  single-engine torque available prior to retarding the throttle to flight idle (T-3).  The pilot flying will maintain torque on the  manually  governed engine approximately  5 to  10 percent  below  the governed engine, but it may be less than 5% under high density altitude conditions (T-3). 6.6.2.  Single Hydraulic System Failure Operations.  Aircrew may enter the maneuver on the ground or in the air.  If in the air, aircrew will be at a minimum altitude of 500 feet AGL and 70 KIAS and in straight-and-level flight prior to moving the Hydraulic Selector Switch (T-3). 6.6.3.  Simulated  Single-Engine  Emergencies.    Aircrew  will  not  reduce  a  throttle  to  initiate practice single-engine  emergencies lower than 150 feet  AGL and 55 KIAS.  Note:  Practice single-engine  emergencies  may  be  initiated  below  the  above  listed  altitude  as  long  as throttles are left at full open and torque available is limited on both engines versus reducing the  throttle  on  the  simulated  failed  engine.    Aircrew  will  not  reduce  a  throttle  on  the simulated failed engine unless indicated dual torque is below single-engine torque available (T-3).  If unsafe conditions exist, aircrew will use both engines for the go-around or landing, as required (T-3). 6.6.3.1.  Aircrew will practice single-engine approaches and landings to a unit approved slide  area  or  hard  surface  landing  area  (T-3).    The  pilot  flying  will  identify  a  go/no-go point for the approach (T-3). 6.6.3.2.  Aircrew  will  perform  a  single  engine  power-available  check  prior  to  beginning the approach if the simulated single-engine landing will be performed with one engine at flight idle (T-3). 6.7.  Practice Autorotations. 6.7.1.  Aircrew  will  terminate  autorotations  and  initiate  a  power  recovery  at  the  first indication of abnormally high/low rotor RPM, excessive sink rate, low airspeed, ineffective flare, or at any time an inadvertent touchdown might occur (T-2). 6.7.2.  Aircrew  will  enter  straight  ahead  and  90-degree  autorotations  at  least  500  feet  AGL and 60-100 KIAS (T-2).  Aircrew will enter autorotations of 180-degrees or greater at least 800 feet AGL and 60-100 KIAS (T-2). 6.7.3.  Aircrew  will  terminate  all  practice  autorotations  of  180  degrees  or  less  to  a  power recovery  no  lower  than  5  feet  AGL  with  a  maximum  ground  speed  of  30  knots  (T-2).  Aircrew will terminate practice autorotations in excess of 180 degrees to a power recovery no lower than 500 feet AGL (T-2). 32 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 6.7.4.  For  the  first  autorotation  during  training  and  currency  sorties,  the  instructor  or evaluator  pilot  will  fly  a  straight-ahead  autorotation  to  evaluate  aircraft  performance  (T-2).  During instructor upgrades, the instructor pilot candidate may perform this autorotation. 6.7.5.  When performing any autorotation, prior to descending below 150 feet AGL, aircrew must  maneuver  the  aircraft  to  wings  level,  have  a  minimum  of  60  KIAS,  have  rotor  RPM within limits, and be aligned within 30 degrees of the landing/recovery heading (T-2).  The pilot flying will initiate the flare at approximately 100 to 75 feet AGL with a minimum of 60 KIAS  (T-2).    If  any  of  these  conditions  are  not  met,  aircrew  will  initiate  a  power  recovery immediately (T-2).  The wings level requirement does not prohibit minor heading corrections on final. 6.7.6.  Wind  Requirements.    When  steady-state  winds  are  less  than  15  knots,  aircrew  will align the aircraft landing within 90 degrees of the wind direction; if steady-state winds are 15 knots or greater, aircrew will align the aircraft landing heading within 45 degrees of the wind direction (T-2). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 33 Chapter 7 INSTRUMENT PROCEDURES 7.1.  Climbout/Descent.  The  pilot  not  flying  will  make  the  following  calls  during  instrument climb out/descent: (T-3). 7.1.1.  “500  feet  below/above”  assigned  altitude  and  “100  feet  below/above”  assigned altitude (T-3). 7.1.2.  “500 feet above/below” initial approach fix altitude, step down fix altitude, or holding altitude (T-3). 7.1.3.  “100 feet above/below” initial approach fix altitude, step down fix altitude, or holding altitude (T-3). 7.2.  Deviations.  Any  crewmember  seeing  deviations  greater  than  10  degrees  of  heading,  10 knots  of  airspeed,  or  100  feet  of  altitude  will  inform  the  pilot  flying  (T-3).    Deviations  from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced (T-3). 7.3.  Non-Precision Approaches.  The pilot not flying will make the following calls during non-precision approaches: 7.3.1.  “100 feet above MDA” (Minimum Descent Altitude) (T-3). 7.3.2.  “Minimums” at MDA (T-3). 7.3.3.  “Runway  in  sight.”  Call  when  the  runway  environment  is  in  sight.    Do  not  call  too soon when obstructions to vision (such as fog, haze, low stratus clouds, etc.) are present (T-3). 7.3.4.  “Go-around.”  Call at missed approach point if the runway environment is not in sight or at any time the aircraft is not in a safe position to land (T-3). 7.4.  Precision Approaches.  The pilot not flying will make the following calls during precision approaches: 7.4.1.  “100 feet above Decision Altitude” (DA) (T-3). 7.4.2.  “Continue.”    Call  at  DA  if  only  the  approach  lights  can  be  seen,  indicating  that  the pilot may continue descent to 100 feet above threshold elevation (THRE) or touchdown zone elevation (TDZE) using the approach lights as a reference (T-3). 7.4.3.  “Land.”    Call  at  DA  if  sufficient  visual  reference  with  the  runway  environment  has been established and the aircraft is in position to execute a safe landing (T-3). 7.4.3.1.  If the term “Continue” was used as in paragraph 7.4.2, call “Land” at 100 feet above THRE or TDZE when the red termination bars or the red side row bars are visible and identifiable and the aircraft is in a safe position to land (T-3). 7.4.4.  “Go-around.”  Call at DA if the runway environment is not in sight or at any time the aircraft is not in a safe position to land (T-3). 34 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 7.4.4.1.  If the term “Continue” was used as in paragraph 7.4.2, call “Go-around” at 100 feet above THRE or TDZE when the red termination bars or the red side row bars are not visible and identifiable or if the aircraft is not in a safe position to land (T-3). AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 35 Chapter 8 MISSION EVENTS Section 8A—Non-surveyed/Unprepared Landing Areas 8.1.  Non-surveyed/Unprepared  Landing  Area  Procedures.  Operations  will  be  IAW  the procedures for helicopter landing areas in AFI 11-202V3 (T-2).  For all tactical and non-tactical operations to non-surveyed/unprepared or unfamiliar landing areas, aircrews must analyze winds, power  margin,  hazards,  and  approach  and  departure  plan  (T-2).    Only  one  site  analysis  is required  during  successive  approaches  when  conditions  are  equal  to  or  better  than  previous approaches to the same area. 8.2.  High and Low Reconnaissance. 8.2.1.  Aircrew  will  conduct  a  High  and  Low  Reconnaissance  for  all  operations  to  non-surveyed/unprepared landing area other than: (T-3). 8.2.1.1.  Conducting tactical approaches (T-3). 8.2.1.2.  During a mission where, in the judgment of the AC, the accomplishment of the high  and reconnaissance  would  degrade  or  dangerously  delay  mission accomplishment (T-3). low 8.2.1.3.  Operational  Sites.  (T-3).    OG/CCs  will  define  what  constitutes  an  operational site and requirements in a local instruction. 8.2.2.  Aircrew will overfly the landing area and begin the high reconnaissance at a minimum of 300 feet Above Landing Site (ALS) (T-3).  Aircrew may descend no lower than 100 feet Above  Highest  Obstacle  (AHO)  after  the  initial  overflight  if  necessary  to  analyze  elements affecting  the  LZ  (winds,  terrain,  etc).    To  the  maximum  extent  possible  for  the  high  recon, aircrew should maintain  above minimum  safe single engine airspeed.    If  safe single engine airspeed  is  not  available,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  aircrew  should  maintain  at  or above  minimum  rate  of  descent  airspeed.    If  flying  below  minimum  safe  single  engine airspeed, or if single engine airspeed is unavailable, the AC will ensure a viable escape route is briefed (T-3). 8.2.3.  Aircrew  will  accomplish  a  low  reconnaissance  at  a  minimum  of  50  feet  AHO  along the  flight  path  (T-3).    Aircrew  will  maintain  at/or  above  Effective  Translational  Lift  (ETL) (T-3).  At the pilot's discretion, the low reconnaissance may be performed on final approach if OGE power is available. Section 8B—Low-Level Operations/Tactical Procedures 8.3.  General.  Tactical  operations  may  consist  of  low-level  flight,  normal  flight,  or  a combination of both.  Minimum enroute altitude will be at or above 50 feet AHO or as directed by MAJCOM (T-2). 8.4.  Evasive  Maneuver  Training.  Aircrew  will  maintain  100  feet  AHO  during  en  route evasive  maneuver  training  (T-3).    Pilots  will  make  crew  advisory  calls  prior  to  turns  and  will 36 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 clear their flight path throughout maneuvering (T-3).  If hovering, this does not preclude turning the tail of the helicopter to mitigate the threat or minor heading changes during takeoff. Section 8C—Formation Procedures 8.5.  Formation Types/Maneuvers.  A description of formation types and maneuvers is listed in AFTTP 3-3.H-1. 8.5.1.  Safety Considerations. Perform knock-it-off and terminate calls IAW AFI 11-214. 8.5.2.  Formation Spacing Requirements. 8.5.2.1.  The minimum distance between aircraft in flight is one rotor diameter. 8.5.2.2.  The minimum distance between aircraft taxiing is two rotor diameters. 8.5.2.3.  Rejoins  may  be  straight  ahead  or  turning.    Maximum  bank  angle  for  turning rejoins is 20 degrees. 8.6.  Dissimilar  Formation.  Formation  flights  with  dissimilar  aircraft  are  authorized  when  all participating  crewmembers  are  briefed  and  are  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  other  aircraft’s performance and tactics.  Rotor disk separation will be based on the largest rotor disk diameter (T-3). 8.7.  Blind  Procedures.  Use members/elements lose visual contact within the formation in VMC: the following  procedures  when  one  or  more flight 8.7.1.  Two conditions may result in the formation losing visual contact: 8.7.1.1.  An  Anticipated  Blind  is  when  terrain/environmental  factors  cause  a  loss  of visual cues for a short duration or when visual cues are lost when using pre-coordinated non-visual  station  keeping  that  provides  sufficient  SA  to  ensure  de-confliction.  Examples: Holding one aircraft in terrain while the other unmasks for line of sight to the objective;  crews  see  terrain  that  will  briefly  come  between  the  formation;  using  non-visual means to maintain aircraft separation (i.e. A/A TACAN). 8.7.1.2.  An Unanticipated Blind situation is when visual cues are the sole references used for  formation  separation  and  these  cues  no  longer  provide  sufficient  distance,  aspect  or closure  rate  cues  to  ensure  de-confliction,  or  when  non-visual  methods  do  not  provide sufficient  SA  to  ensure  positive  de-confliction.    Examples:  The  wingman  loses  lead  in ground lights or while maneuvering independently such as during evasive maneuvering. 8.7.2.  Anticipated Blind Procedures: 8.7.2.1.  If  anticipated  blind  occurs,  any  flight  member/element  calls  "Blind  with  SA."  Then the other flight member/element will immediately acknowledge with "Visual" and an informative position call or acknowledge with “Blind.” (T-3). 8.7.2.2.  Flight lead will direct the prebriefed de-confliction plan (T-3). 8.7.3.  Unanticipated Blind Procedures: flight 8.7.3.1.  If  any member/element  will  immediately  acknowledge  with  "Visual"  and  an  informative position call or acknowledge with “Blind.” (T-3). flight  member/element  calls  "Blind," the  other then AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 37 8.7.3.2.  If the other flight member/element is also "Blind", then the flight lead will take action  to  ensure  separation  between  flight  members/elements  (T-3).    When  unable  to ensure separation using non-visual means, flight lead will direct an altitude separation of at least 200 feet (T-3).  The flight lead will specify either AGL or MSL when directing the  formation  to  de-conflict  with  altitude  (T-3).    Climbs/  descents  through  the  de-confliction altitude should be avoided if possible. 8.7.3.3.  If there is no timely acknowledgment of the original "Blind" call, then the flight member/element  initiating the call will maneuver away from  the last known position of the other flight member/element and alter altitude if unable to ensure aircraft separation by non-visual means (T-3). 8.7.3.4.  If  visual  contact  is  not  regained,  the  flight  lead  will  take  additional  positive action to ensure flight path de-confliction within the flight to include a “Knock-It-Off” if necessary (T-3).  Scenario restrictions such as sanctuary altitudes and/or adversary blocks must be considered (T-3). 8.8.  Lost Wingman Procedures.  When a wingman goes inadvertent IMC and loses sight of the preceding  aircraft,  all  members  of  the  formation  must  react  quickly  and  precisely  to  prevent  a midair collision (T-3).  In such a case, the aircraft losing visual contact will call, "Formation Call Sign, Position, Lost Wingman." (T-3).  Formation lead will immediately initiate the breakup by announcing  "Formation  Call  Sign,  Execute,"  the  type  of  breakup  (i.e.  mountainous  or  non-mountainous)  unless  prebriefed,  base  “heading”  (magnetic),  base  “airspeed”,  and  base “Minimum Safe Altitude” (MSA) (T-3).  Formation lead will maintain base parameters and all wingmen will take action based on the base heading, airspeed and MSA  (T-3).  Wingmen will acknowledge lead's call.  Once the formation executes the IMC  breakup, lead will announce or brief any changes to magnetic headings, airspeed, and MSA (T-3). 8.9.1.  If  a  wingman  calls  lost  wingman  and  lead  is  still  VMC  and  able  to  ensure terrain/obstacle clearance, lead should stay VMC.  Formation lead must still make heading, airspeed, and MSA calls for the wingman executing the lost wingman procedure (T-3). 8.9.2.  If another aircraft in the formation calls lost wingman and  you still have sight of the preceding aircraft, maintain formation position on that aircraft.  If you then lose sight of the preceding  aircraft,  execute  lost  wingman  procedures  for  your  original  position  in  the formation. 8.9.3.  Non-Mountainous  Procedures.    The  following  lost  wingman  procedures  are  for  non-mountainous operations (Figure 8.1). 8.9.3.1.  Formation  lead  maintains  base  heading  (usually  straight-ahead),  airspeed,  and climbs to MSA. 8.9.3.2.  Wingmen  turn  away  from  the  preceding  aircraft  and  climb  according  to  the following procedure: Chalk 2 will turn 20° and climb to MSA plus 300, Chalk 3 will turn 30° climb to MSA plus 600 feet, Chalk 4 will turn 40° and climb to MSA plus 900 feet, etc.  (T-3).    Timing  for  all  wingmen  is  30  seconds  and  starts  once  reaching  required altitude.  At the end of timing, all aircraft return to the announced heading. 38 AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 Figure 8.1.  Non-Mountainous Procedures.  8.9.4.  Mountainous  Procedures.  The  following mountainous operations (Figure 8.2). lost  wingman  procedures  are  for 8.9.4.1.  Formation  lead  will  maintain  announced  base  airspeed  or  higher  and  climb  to MSA (T-3).  If possible, lead should accelerate to allow the formation more maneuvering room and to avoid excessively slow airspeeds for wingmen. 8.9.4.2.  Aircraft number two will adjust to maintain announced airspeed minus 10 knots, and climb 300 feet above MSA (T-3). 8.9.4.3.  Aircraft  number  three  will  adjust  to  maintain  announced  airspeed  minus  20 knots, and climb 600 feet above MSA (T-3). 8.9.4.4.  Aircraft number four will adjust to maintain announced airspeed minus 30 knots, and climb 900 feet above MSA (T-3). 8.9.4.5.  As  each  aircraft  reaches  its  assigned  altitude,  maintain  heading  and  assigned airspeed for 3 minutes, then accelerate to the base airspeed. AFI11-2UH-1NV3  30 AUGUST 2017 39 Figure 8.2.
