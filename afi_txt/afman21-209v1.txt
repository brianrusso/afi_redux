Salley) Pages: 16 This publication implements Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 21-2, Munitions and supports Air Force  Instruction  (AFI)  21-201,  Munitions  Management.    This  publication  is  the  primary authorization source that units and command functional  areas use to  forecast  ground munitions needs throughout the Air Force (AF).  Units and command functional areas must use Air Force Catalog  (AFCAT)  21-209,  Volume  2,  Demolition  Munitions  when  forecasting  demolition munitions  needs  (e.g.,  blasting  caps,  demolition  blocks,  dynamite).    This  manual  contains operational  and  training  ground  munition  authorizations  and  explains  how  authorizations  are established,  reviewed,  changed  and  forecasted.    It  applies  to  individuals  at  all  levels  who  use ground munitions, including the Air Force Reserve (AFR) and Air National Guard (ANG), except where noted otherwise.  This publication may be supplemented at any level, but all supplements must be routed to the office of primary responsibility (OPR) listed above for coordination prior to certification and approval.  Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the OPR listed above using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate chain of command.  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number  following  the  compliance  statement.    See  AFI  33-360,  Publications  and  Forms Management,  Table  1.1  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated  with  the  Tier  numbers.

Ground  Munitions  Authorization  Tables  (GMAT).  The  GMAT  contains  the  munitions authorizations for users to forecast and validate known munitions requirements.  The GMAT are located domain: https://www.my.af.mil/ammoprod/wm/.    Figure  1.1.  depicts  the  coordination  and  approval process.  All units requesting ground munitions will maintain supporting documentation associated with establishing requirements and/or forecasting for these assets. (T-1). the  GACP  web homepage site on through the following 2.1.1.  Units will use the GMAT to forecast for known ground munitions requirements. (T-1). 2.1.2.  No GMAT reference is required for unique and one-time requirements (e.g., specialized shooting schools, one-time unique events). 2.1.3.  Requesting GMAT Changes. Units or functions responsible for an operational mission, training  program  or  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  requirement  will send requests to the parent MAJCOM MUFM for consideration (Figure A2.1.). (T-1).  The MUFM forwards the request to the AFGMM to create or change a munitions GMAT.  Figure 1.1. depicts the coordination and approval process. Figure 1.1.  Establishing or Changing Munitions Authorizations.  2.2.  Establishing  or  Changing  Allocations.  Units  or  functions  responsible  for  an  operational mission, training program  or research, development,  test and  evaluation  (RDT&E)  requirement should submit Out Of Cycle Requests (OOCR) through their supporting Munitions Accountable Systems Officer (MASO) to establish initial munition authorizations.  Accomplish the OOCR in accordance  with  AFI  21-201.    Future  munition  requirements  are  established  by  submitting forecasts IAW paragraph 2.3. 2.2.1.  Ground Munitions Users. 2.2.1.1.  Ground  munitions  users  will  ensure  each  OOCR  request  contains  a  complete explanation and justification of the need for each specific munition item and must include the  computations  used  to  determine  the  requirements.  (T-1).    For  example,  the computations include the rounds needed per person for the approved training course, the number  of  courses  scheduled  and  the  number  of  students  per  course/class.    Requests include  the  office  of  primary  responsibility  (OPR)  for  the  guidance  directing  the requirement,  the  Air  Force  publication  or  other  governing  policy  that  establishes  the AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 7 requirement,  the  FUC  and  the  Requirement  Code.    Refer  to  AFI  21-201  if  a  FUC  or Requirement Code does not exist. 2.2.2.  MUFM.    The  MUFM  will  attempt  to  support  training  OOCRs  with  excess authorizations  within  their  FUC.    If  the  request  is  unsupportable,  the  MUFM  approves  the request and forwards the OOCR to the applicable MAJCOM Munitions Staff.  Refer to AFI 21-201 if the requesting unit does not have an assigned MUFM. 2.2.3.  MAJCOM  Munitions  Staff.    The  MAJCOM  Munitions  Staff  will  attempt  to  support training  OOCRs  with  excess  authorizations  within  their  MAJCOM.    If  the  request  is unsupportable,  the  MAJCOM  Staff  will  approve  the  request  and  forward  the  OOCR  to  the AFGMM. 2.2.4.  AFGMM.  The AFGMM reviews and validates each request, determines supportability and updates the authorization accordingly.  Disapproved requests are submitted electronically through the chain with reasoning included. 2.2.5.  Units  may  request  one-time  authorizations  or  interim  changes  for  items  needed  for special projects, missions or training not covered by this publication or the applicable GMAT authorizations.  Requesting units must use the OOCR procedures identified in AFI 21-201 for one-time authorizations (e.g., specialized shooting schools, one-time unique events). (T-1). 2.3.  Developing  Forecasts.  Use  the  authorizations  in  the  GMAT,  located  within  the  GACP website, under the Community Information Module to develop annual munitions forecasts.  Each unit that has a requirement for ground munitions will: 2.3.1.  Compute  the  total  munitions  required  in  accordance  with  this  publication,  MUFM instructions,  AFI  21-201  and  the  PCAR  memorandum.  (T-1).    Include  previous  year expenditures  as  applicable  and  justification  for  any  variance  larger  than  10  percent.  (T-2).  Follow the guidance in paragraphs 2.2.1.1. of this manual when calculating requirements. 2.3.2.  Prior to unit submission, the unit commander will review and sign the ground munitions forecast and compare it to previous expenditure history or other locally produced expenditure tracking products, to ensure Category D (training) requirements are consistent with historical expenditure data. (T-2).  If the amount requested exceeds the previous year’s expenditure rate by 10 percent or more, the account custodian must include detailed justification for the increase within the forecast module in the Agile Munitions Support Tool (AMST). (T-2). 2.3.3.  Required  Documentation.    Units  forecasting  for  ground  munitions  will  maintain  all appropriate documentation (e.g., signed forecast, training plans, past expenditure reports, all calculations used) associated with generating munitions forecasts in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). (T-1). 2.3.3.1.  Units  must  have  an  approved  course  of  fire  (see  AFI  36-2654,  Combat  Arms Program) for proficiency, sustainment and/or dye marking cartridge training. (T-1).  Units will incorporate the course into the annual training plan or training memorandum endorsed by the unit commander. (T-2).  This plan must indicate the number of rounds required per student, per training event and it will become the basis for the annual forecast  for these munitions. (T-1).  Note:  See Attachment 3 for examples. 2.3.3.2.  Each  unit  will  develop  a  tracking  system  identifying  the  number  of  personnel trained,  the  names  of  the  individuals  trained,  the  date  and  time  training  occurred,  the 8 AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 weapon type, number of munitions fired (by caliber and type) and the lot number(s) of the munitions expended. (T-1).  This includes units firing blanks, birdshot and dye marking cartridges,  proficiency  or  sustainment  munitions  (e.g.,  Honor  Guard,  Force-on-Force).  Combat  Arms  uses  the  Security  Forces  Management  Information  System  (SFMIS)  for qualification training as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  Note: Any tracking system developed must comply with the provisions of Title 5 United States Code Section 552a, The Privacy Act of 1974. (T-0). 2.3.3.3.  .  Combat  Arms  (CA).    For  CA  qualification  and  orientation  courses,  use  the number of rounds required by the course of fire in AFMAN 36-2655, USAF Small Arms and Light Weapons Qualification Program, times the number of students requiring small arms  qualification  training,  using  the  annual  unit  training  requirements  provided  by  the units supported for forecasting, as directed by AFI 36-2654.  CA must adjust the quantities per student for any approved deviations or waivers they have for orientation or qualification courses. (T-1).  For example, if a Combat Arms unit has an approved waiver not to conduct the night fire table of the Rifle/Carbine Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC), they do not forecast for the rounds needed for this table.  Note:  See Attachment 3 for forecast examples. 2.4.  Validating  Munitions  Forecast.  Munitions  validation  is  a  tier-stepped  approach  to finalizing the munitions forecast.  Each step in the process is crucial providing a level of scrutiny to ensure munitions forecasts are generated appropriately, accurately and to prevent forecasting of excess quantities of assets. 2.4.1.  Munitions Accountable System Officer (MASO).  The MASO will ensure units with munitions accounts submit forecasts and follow procedures in accordance with (IAW) AFI 21-201,  this  publication,  PCAR  memorandum  and  MAJCOM  munitions  staff  direction.  (T-1).  Note:  See paragraph 2.3.2., for unit responsibilities prior to submitting forecast to the MASO. 2.4.2.  MUFM.    The  MUFM  validates  forecasted  munitions  requirements  and  ensures  the forecasts are submitted IAW AFI 21-201, this publication, PCAR memorandum; MAJCOM munitions staff direction and AFGMM direction. 2.4.2.1.  The MUFM ensures all Category  D (training) munition forecasts are within 10 percent of the previous  year’s forecast.  If above 10 percent, the MUFM will validate a detailed justification was loaded in AMST and may reduce the forecasted amount to within 10 percent of the previous year’s expenditure, if the unit does not provide a detailed and acceptable justification in AMST. 2.4.2.2.  Prior to MUFM validation, the MUFM will review the ground munitions forecast and compare it to the Munitions Expenditure Report, or other locally produced report, to ensure Category D (Training) requirements are consistent with historical expenditure data. 2.4.3.  AFGMM.  The AFGMM verifies that the requirements are supportable and attainable throughout the Five Year Budget cycle and performs Level 1 verification during the annual PCAR working group. 2.4.3.1.  The AFGMM will review munition-training accounts on 14 March each year.  If units  are  below  a  50  percent  expenditure  rate  without  justification,  the  AFGMM  may redistribute the unused allocations to meet Air Force mission needs.  For example, if the AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 9 unit’s expenditure rate for an item is 38 percent on 1 March, the AFGMM may redistribute 12 percent of the allocated munitions. 2.4.3.1.1.  The AFGMM will notify the MASO and the unit custodian.  If the unit has a continued need for the munitions, the unit custodian will provide justification to retain the munitions before the AFGMM makes the final decision to redistribute allocations. (T-1).  Units should notify the MASO of their intent to utilize their remaining assets in order  to  ease  the  redistribution  of  munitions.    The  AFGMM  may  re-allocate  assets without account custodian concurrence to meet Air Force needs. 2.4.3.1.2.  Redistributed allocations may be supportable at the requesting installation if assets are available.  However, if not available, physical movement during the fiscal year may or may not be possible depending on transportation funding. 2.4.3.1.3.  Custodians  with  known  excess  allocated  munitions  will  submit  a memorandum  to  the  MUFM,  with  informational  copy  to  the  MASO  requesting redistribution.  (T-1).    Reasons  for  known  redistribution  may  be  for  range  closure, removal  of  weapon  authorization,  etc.    If  the  MUFM  is  unable  to  redistribute,  the MUFM will forward the memorandum to the AFGMM. 2.4.3.1.4.  Expenditure Rates:  In addition to the March review (paragraph 2.4.3.1.), the AFGMM will review expenditures of Category D munitions in September and October each  year.    The  AFGMM  will  identify  accounts  with  expenditure  rates  below  90 percent and may reduce the forecast for these munitions for the next fiscal year unless the account custodian provides adequate justification for the low expenditure rate. 2.5.  Special Instruction 2.5.1.  To  use  or  procure  commercial  off-the-shelf  (COTS)  munitions,  the  requesting  units must process a request and comply with the guidance in AFI 21-201. (T-1). 2.5.2.  If  training  conditions  do  not  permit  use  of  identified  munitions,  MAJCOMs  may authorize units to forecast for substitute items (e.g., approved units may forecast for and use 7.62mm ball in lieu of 7.62mm tracer due to fire hazards on their training ranges). 2.5.3.  Munitions  requirements  forecast  categories:    Refer  to  AFI  21-201,  for  applicable information on munitions categories and requirement codes. 2.5.4.  Lead Time for Delivery of Munitions.  New or increased munitions requirements can take  two  or  more  years  after  forecast  before  items  are  available.    Programming,  approval, funding and procurement actions make up this lead-time.  The Air Force's ability to support operational and training requirements is directly dependent upon the timeliness and accuracy of forecasts.  Munitions users should order only what they can use and use what they order.  By following this simple methodology, end-of-year munitions excesses will be minimal. 2.6.  GMAT  Authorizations.  Munitions  authorized  in  GMAT  table  Category  TRAINING MUNITIONS AUTHORIZATION are for training, exercises, evaluations and competitions.  They are  maximum  authorizations  and  account  custodians  will  consider  factors  such  as  storage requirements, past average expenditure history and future training requirements when preparing munitions  forecasts.  (T-2).    Units  will  not  simply  forecast  for  the  maximum  number  of  items authorized in the GMAT. 10 AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 2.7.  Munitions  Authorizations and Competitions.  Foreign government students or personnel from any branch, department or activity of the US government attached to the Air Force as a student (including Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps) for training receive the same authorizations as Air Force personnel. Evaluations Exercises, for Training, 2.8.  Operational  Munitions.  Munitions  authorized  in  GMAT  table  Category  OPERATIONAL MUNITIONS AUTHORIZATION are for operational peacetime and wartime missions.  They are the  maximum  authorizations,  and  functional  managers  should  consider  factors  such  as  storage requirements when preparing munitions forecasts. table  Category  MOBILITY 2.9.  Mobility  Munitions.  Munitions  authorized MUNITIONS  AUTHORIZATION  are  for  contingency  missions  that  may  require  the  physical shipment or transportation from the home station unit in support of tasked and/or assigned Unit Line Numbers.  They are the maximum authorizations and functional managers should consider factors such as storage requirements when preparing munitions forecasts. in  GMAT  JOHN B.COOPER, Lt Gen, USAF DCS/Logistics, Engineering & Force Protection AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 11 GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION Attachment 1 References AFI 21-201, Munitions Management, 3 Jun 2015 AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, 1 Dec 2015 AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms Program, 13 Jan 2016 AFMAN 33-363, Management of Records, 1 Mar 2008 AFMAN 36-2655, USAF Small Arms and Light Weapons Qualification Programs, 12 Aug 2016 AFPD 21-2, Munitions, 18 May 2017 Prescribed Forms None Adopted Forms AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication Abbreviations and Acronyms ACC—Air Combat Command AFCAT—Air Force Catalog AFDPO—Air Force Departmental Publication Office AFGMM—Air Force Ground Munitions Manager AFI—Air Force Instruction AFIMSC—Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center AFMAN—Air Force Manual AFPD—Air Force Policy Directive AFQC—Air Force Qualification Course AFR—Air Force Reserve AFRIMS—Air Force Records Information Management System AFSFC—Air Force Security Forces Center AMST—Agile Munitions Support Tool ANG—Air National Guard COTS–Commercial-Off-The—Shelf CTG—Cartridge DCS—Deputy Chief of Staff 12 AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 FUC—Functional User Code GACP—Global Ammunition Control Point GMAT—Ground Munitions Authorization Tables IAW—In Accordance With MAJCOM—Major Command MASO—Munitions Accountable Systems Officer MUFM—Munitions User Functional Manager OOCR–Out-Of-Cycle—Request OPR—Office of Primary Responsibility PCAR—Peacetime Conventional Ammunition Requirements RDS—Records Disposition Schedule rds—Rounds RDT&E—Research, Development, Test and Evaluation SFMIS—Security Forces Management Information System US—United States USAF—United States Air Force  AFMAN21-209V1  3 OCTOBER 2017 13 Attachment 2 EXAMPLE GROUND MUNITIONS AUTHORIZATION CHANGE REQUEST Figure A2.1.
