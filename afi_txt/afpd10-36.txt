Overview. 2 AFPD10-36  5 JUNE 2017 1.1.  This  publication  mandates  a  process  to  ensure  proper  aircraft  airworthiness  (AW), aircraft  status,  aircrew  qualification,  safety,  maintenance  and  liability  when  planning  or supporting a procurement of contracted ADAIR and CCAS. 1.2.  When available organic Air Force assets are insufficient to meet all Battlefield Airmen and  Aircrew  training  requirements  to  maintain  Combat  Mission  Readiness  (CMR),  air support for training should be contracted pursuant to this AFPD. 2.  Policy. 2.1.  DoD contracted aircraft may be authorized to operate in areas designated (by the FAA) as  Special  Use  Airspace,  such  as  Military  Operating  Areas  (MOA)  and  DoD  ranges.    Air Force  contracts  shall  require  compliance  with  applicable  FAA,  ranges,  and  local  operating regulations and procedures. 2.2.  Contracted aircraft shall be assessed for AW IAW AFPD 62-6, USAF Airworthiness. 2.3.  Contracted aviation services shall be acquired and operated IAW DCMA 8210.1C (AFI 10-220). 2.4.  Contracted  flights  are  Civil  Aircraft  Operations  (CAO)  unless  specifically  designated and  declared  as  Public  Aircraft  Operations  (PAO)  by  the  Air  Force.    NOTE:  Only  flights within the National Airspace System are legally eligible for PAO status. 2.5.  When  the  Air  Force  designates  and  declares  contracted  flights  as  PAO,  the  Air  Force becomes responsible for oversight of the operation, including aircraft airworthiness, aircrew qualification and training, maintenance procedures, and safety standards in accordance with 49.U.S.C§ 40102(a)(41) and 40125. 3.  Responsibilities. 3.1.  Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations (AF/A3): 3.1.1.  Develop policy for the use of contracted ADAIR and CCAS aircraft activities. 3.1.2.

Evaluate  options  affecting  CAO  or  PAO  status  considering  potential  program  impacts including requirements, oversight responsibilities, cost, and schedule.  Confirm with the Air Force Airworthiness Authority that the elected option is technically feasible. AFPD10-36  5 JUNE 2017 3 3.3.4.  Designate  and  declare  flights  within  their  contracted  aircraft  portfolios  as  PAO, when appropriate, in accordance with 49.U.S.C§ 40102(a)(41) and 40125. 3.3.5.  Provide  oversight  of  aircrew,  maintenance,  and  safety  standards  for  flights designated and declared as PAO. 3.3.6.  Assign  and  execute  installation  level  program  management  and  contracting support  for  functional  commanders  and  functional  directors  (FC/FD)  as  applicable  for contracted aircraft. 3.4.  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  Commander  (AFMC)/CC,  in  addition  to  the responsibilities identified in para 3.3  : 3.4.1.  As  the  Air  Force  Airworthiness  Authority,  utilize  the  Technical  Airworthiness Authority (TAA) to conduct airworthiness assessments, conduct CAO/PAO assessments to evaluate the technical feasibility of conducting proposed contractor operations as CAO or PAO, and issue airworthiness flight authorizations. 3.4.2.

Aggressor squadrons use enemy tactics, techniques, and procedures to give a realistic simulation of air combat (as opposed to training against one's own forces). Airworthiness  Flight  Authorization—Document  issued  by  the  TAA  which  affirms  that  the appropriate  tenets  of  the  airworthiness  process  are  met  and  that  the  aircraft  or  air  system  was assessed  against  the  required  airworthiness  standards  and  any  residual  risk  to  aircrew,  ground crew,  passengers,  or  to  third  parties  has  been  accepted  by  the  appropriate  authority.    An airworthiness  flight  authorization  may  be  a  Military  Type  Certificate  (MTC),  Military  Flight Release (MFR), or Civil Aircraft Operation (CAO) verification letter. Civil Aircraft Operation (CAO)— CAO are all aircraft operations other than those conducted as PAO in accordance with applicable law. Close  Air  Support  (CAS)—  CAS  is  air  action  by  fixed-wing  (FW)  and  rotary-wing  (RW) aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces and requires detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces. Dry Contract Close Air Support— Contract aircraft using CAS procedures that do not release ordnance, practice munitions, or weapons firing in support of JTAC training events. Dry Terminal  Attack  Control—Control of live aircraft where air-to-ground munitions are not present or release is not intended, also known as “Dry CAS”. Live  Contract  Close  Air  Support—Contract  aircraft  using  CAS  procedures  that  release ordnance, practice munitions, or weapons firing in support of JTAC training events. Live  Terminal  Attack  Control—Control  of  live  aircraft  where  air-to-ground  munitions  (live, inert  or  training  ordnance)  are  present  and  release  is  intended,  also  known  as  “Live  CAS”.  Actual munition release must take place to count towards live control requirements. National  Airspace  System—  Airspace,  navigation  facilities  and  airports  of  the  United  States along  with  their  associated  information,  services,  rules,  regulations,  policies,  procedures, personnel and equipment.  It includes components shared jointly with the military. It is one of the most complex aviation systems in the world and services air travel in the United States and over large portions of the world's oceans. Public  Aircraft  Operation  (PAO)—  PAO  is  the  operation  of  an  aircraft  that  meets  the  legal definition  of  “public  aircraft”  established  in  49  U.S.C.  §  40102(a)(41),  and  the  legal qualifications for public aircraft status outlined in 49 U.S.C. § 40125.  Whether an operation may 6 AFPD10-36  5 JUNE 2017 be  designated  as  PAO  is  determined  on  a  flight-by-flight  basis,  in  accordance  with  applicable law.    A  specific  determination  by  an  appropriate  government  authority  is  required  before operations will be deemed to be in PAO status, and notification to the FAA is expected.  Absent a  specific  PAO  declaration  by  the  government  sponsor,  all  contracted  operations  remain  civil aircraft operations.
