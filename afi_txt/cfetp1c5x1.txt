This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel with a clear career path to success in all aspects of career field training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  It contains administrative details and a specialty description, explains the purpose and use of the CFETP, identifies career field requirements and progression, provides career field information, and documents training decisions.  Each skill level is also defined, known resource constraints are identified, and a list of continuation training for the specialty is provided.  Note:  Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD), contains the specialty description.    2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core tasks, and correspondence course requirements; Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a qualification training package (QTP) which may be developed to support proficiency training.  Section D identifies a training course index, which is used to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements.    3.  This CFETP is designed to ensure individuals in AFSC 1C5X1 receive comprehensive and effective training at the appropriate phases of their career.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.            3  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL).

This CFETP provides information necessary for the Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient 1C5X1 career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas: initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT), and continuation training (CT).  Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty (AFS)-specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion required for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge training required for the job.  Continuation training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required.  The CFETP also serves other purposes, to include the following:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training program.  2.  Uses.  The AFCFM will maintain this CFETP in accordance with AFI 36-2201.  MFMs will review the CFETP at least annually to ensure currency and accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM. Training managers at all levels will use this plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available and instituted for each individual in the 1C5X1 career ladder.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies to obtain resources needed to meet training requirements.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and upgrade skills requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can establish identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training resources.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is approval authority.  AFCFMs will review the CFETP annually to ensure it is accurate and current. Assess whether the AFS has undergone any mission or role related changes, and as a result, if a U&TW is necessary. The review will also satisfy the annual certification requirements of AFI 33-360, Volume 1, Publications and Forms Management.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  Applicable inputs/changes to this CFETP will be routed to 334 TRS/TRR, 610 Hangar Road Building 4214, Suite 105, Keesler AFB MS 39534-2235.   7 PART I CFETP 1C5X1, 20 Sep 2016 SECTION B - CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION  4.

The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure individuals receive viable training at the appropriate points in their career.  The following narratives, and the AFSC 1C5X1 career field charts, identify the training career path.  They define the training required in an individual’s career.  5.1.  Apprentice (3) Level.  Initial skills training in this specialty consist of the tasks and knowledge training provided in the 3-skill level resident courses (E3ABR1C531) located at Keesler AFB, MS. The decision to train specific task and knowledge items in the initial skills courses is based on a review of the occupational survey report (OSR) data, training requirements analysis data, and 1C531 subject matter expert (SME) input.  Task and knowledge requirements are identified in the specialty training standard in Part II of this CFETP, Section A.  Individuals will work with a trainer to enhance their knowledge and skills and prepare for duty position qualification.  Individuals must complete the initial skills courses to be awarded AFSC 1C531.    5.2.  Journeyman (5) Level. Training for the 5-skill level consists of task and knowledge training provided through the specialty training standard (STS) and is based on an analysis of duties contained in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  Career knowledge is provided in the 1C5X1 5-skill level career development course (CDC).  Individuals are entered into 5-skill level upgrade training (UGT) upon arrival at their initial duty station.  All individuals upgrading to 5-skill level in this specialty must complete the following: 1C5X1 CDCs; certification on all core tasks indicated on the STS; unit-specific duty position tasks; and 12 months in upgrade training (9 months for re-trainees).  Once upgraded to the 5-level, journeymen begin to broaden their experience through continuation training and should seek qualification in multiple duty positions.  Five-levels may be assigned/qualified at job positions as listed in the career field pyramid and AFI 36-2618..  Individuals will complete required Professional Military Education (PME).  Appointment as unit trainers is authorized for individuals considered the “most qualified”.  Individuals use their CDCs to help prepare for promotion testing under the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  They should consider continuing their education towards a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree in Air and Space Operations Technology.     5.3.  Craftsman (7) Level.  Training for the 7-skill level consists of task and knowledge training provided through the specialty training standard and is based on analysis of the duties contained in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  Individuals selected for promotion to SSgt are entered into 7-level upgrade training on the first day of the promotion cycle.  All individuals upgrading to the 7-skill level in this specialty must complete the following: 1C571 CDCs; certification on all core tasks indicated on the STS; unit-specific duty position tasks; and complete a minimum of 12 months in upgrade training (6 months for retrainees).  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions as listed in the career field pyramid and AFI 36-2618.. They may also be assigned to staff positions such as NCOIC of various duty sections as well as positions in standardization/evaluation and training offices.  They can also be assigned to Group and MAJCOM positions.  1C571s should take courses and otherwise increase their knowledge in management of resources and personnel.  Continued academic education through CCAF and higher degree programs is strongly encouraged.  When promoted to Technical Sergeant, individuals will complete required PME.  7-level CDC are being developed and will be a prerequisite for award of the 1C5X1 7-skill level.  5.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.  To be awarded AFSC 1C591 an individual must be a SMSgt complete PME and any other requirements specified in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  A Superintendent can expect to fill positions as listed in the career field pyramid and AFI 36-2618.  Additional training in the areas of training development, budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  Higher education and completion of courses outside the career AFSC core competencies are also recommended.  5.5.  Chief Enlisted Manager (CEM) (00) Level.  To be awarded AFSC 1C500 an individual must be a CMSgt and complete any requirements specified in the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  A CEM is expected to fill positions as listed in the career field pyramid and AFI 36-2618.

Higher education and completion of courses outside the career AFSC core competencies are also recommended.  6.  Training Decisions.  This CFETP uses a building block approach to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Command and Control Battle Management career field.  It was developed to include life-cycle training requirements for this specialty.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.    6.1.  Initial Skills Training.  At the September 2014 STRT, the 1C5X1 STS was changed to eliminate system initialization task performance requirements from the initial skills course.  6.2.  Five-Level Upgrade Training.  At the September 2014 STRT and the April 2015 meeting, training requirements were updated to meet current career field training requirements.  CDCs are now being revised and will incorporate these changes.  6.3.  Seven-Level Upgrade Training.  At the September 2014 STRT and the April 2015 meeting, training requirements were established to meet current career field training requirements.  CDCs are now being developed to implement these changes.    6.4.  Continuation Training.  The purpose of continuation training is to provide additional training that exceeds the minimum upgrade training requirements and allow individuals to become proficient at their present and future duty positions.  Continuation training also assists individuals in maintaining proficiency at their duty position and affords them an opportunity to reach their full potential.  MAJCOM FMs must develop a continuation training program that ensures individuals in the 1C5X1 career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  7.

This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning 20160511 and graduating on 20160620 for 3-skill level training.  Projected implementation of the updated 5-skill level CDC is November 2016 and initial implementation of the 7-skill level CDC is projected for January 2017.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, this STS and in collaboration with the Command and Control Battle Management Operations, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is mandatory for all command and control specialties, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record.  The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and qualification training is the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) and the application is located on the Advanced Distribution Learning Services (ADLS) web site at https://golearn.adls.af.mil.   2.1.  Column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference): Lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  2.2.  Column 2.  2.2.1.  Core Task.  Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column.  As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all core and critical tasks for skill level upgrade.  Third party certification is required for all core and critical tasks.  NOTE:  All 5-level core tasks are also considered 7-level core tasks by default in the automated training record since a 5-level upgrade must be achieved before an individual can enter into 7-level upgrade.   2.2.2.  Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column 4A(1) are considered wartime tasks.  In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment when implemented by HQ AETC. 2.3.  Column 3. (Certification for OJT).  Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use the automated training record application to document individual qualifications.  Task certification of core and critical tasks require a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier.  All non-core tasks require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only. 2.4.  Column 4 (Proficiency Codes Used to Indicate Training/Information Provided).  Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements. It  shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.   See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.  Course descriptions and reporting instructions for course E3ABR1C531 are identified in the Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) database which is located at the following URL: https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp.  2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.   2.6.  Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  The STS becomes the JQS for on-the-job training (OJT) when placed in the automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  2.6.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training.   2.6.1.1.  Duty Position.  Duty position titles and task requirements for each position will be developed / identified by the workcenter supervisor in the automated training application.  Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under trainees User Profile section of the trainee’s automated training record.  NOTE:  The AFCFM may supplement the duty position titles and task requirements as needed or deemed necessary for the career field.   2.6.1.2.  Duty Position Change.  To change a trainee duty position title select the User Profile section under the trainee record and select the new duty position from the dropdown box, entry the date entered new duty position and  19 PART II CFETP 1C5X1, 20 Sep 2016 save the update.  Under the trainee JQS section you will see the new tasks associated with the selected duty position.  The trainee and trainer/certifier will need to sign off the tasks associated with the new position.    2.6.1.3.  Transcribe Function for Automated CFETP.  The trainee supervisor will follow the guidance established by the automated training record in transcribing tasks from previous paper version to the new automated CFETP version.  The AFTR 2.0 Tutorial Guide is located on the AFTR sharepoint site https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-A6/24048/OO-EN-CE-22/default.aspx.   2.6.1.4.  Transcribing External Training Certification.  If a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.  If the course title is not listed, contact the Unit Training Manager (UTM) to have it loaded from the master catalog.  If it is not listed in the master catalog a request can be send to the AFCFM to have it loaded in the master catalog.  2.6.1.5.  Documenting Career Knowledge.  When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. NOTE: Career Knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  2.6.1.6.  Decertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title.  The supervisor shall select the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the task was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training.  The individual is recertified using the normal certification process.  2.6.1.7.  Recertification.  When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to annual or bi-annual requirements.  The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the recertification was completed.    2.6.2.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. This equates to a 3c in the proficiency code key.   Graduates of the 3-level resident course are trained to the level indicated by the codes in column 4 of the STS, as they relate to the proficiency code key at the front of the STS, NOT to the CMR level. 2.7.  Specialty Training Standard.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces. 3.  Recommendations.  Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC training.  A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisors’ convenience.  For a quick response to concerns, call our CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or fax us at DSN 597-3790, or e-mail us at, 81trg-tget@us.af.mil.

Task Performance Levels  *Task Knowledge Levels  **Subject Knowledge Levels Proficiency Code Key Definition:  The individual Scale Value 1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D Can do simple parts of the task.  Needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task.  (Extremely Limited) Can do most parts of the task.  Needs help only on hardest parts.  (Partially Proficient) Can do all parts of the task.  Needs only a spot check of completed work.  (Competent) Can do the complete task quickly and accurately.  Can tell or show others how to do the task.  (Highly Proficient) Can name parts, tools, and simple facts about the task.  (Nomenclature) Can determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  (Procedures) Can identify when and why the task must be done and why each step is needed. (Operating Principles) Can predict, isolate, and resolve problems about the task.  (Advanced Theory) Can identify basic facts and terms about the subject.  (Facts) Can identify relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject.  (Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Explanations * A task knowledge scale value may be used alone or with a task performance scale value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b)  ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  -  This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.  X  This mark is used alone in the course columns to show that training is required but not given due to limitations in resources.  NOTE: All 3-level tasks and knowledge items shown with a proficiency code are considered wartime tasks.  See paragraph 2.1.1. for description of wartime schedule/tasks.   24 CFETP 1C5X1, 20 Sep 2016 PART II Attachment 2  A2.  Specialty Training Standard.    A2.1.  Identification.
