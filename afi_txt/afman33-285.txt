Objectives.  This  manual Training,  Certification  and  Workforce  Management,  15  August  2004  and  DoD  8570.01-M, Information  Assurance  Workforce  Improvement  Program,  19  December  2005  and  specifically identifies  AF  requirements,  roles,  and  responsibilities.  The  primary  objective  of  the  Air  Force (AF)  Cybersecurity  Workforce  Improvement  Program  (WIP)  is  to  train,  educate,  certify,  and qualify personnel commensurate with their responsibilities to develop, use, operate, administer, maintain,  defend,  and  dispose/retire  DoD  Systems.  All  authorized  users  of  DoD  information systems (ISs)/Platform Information Technology (PIT) systems must receive initial cybersecurity user  awareness  training  as  a  condition  of  access  to  an  IS  IAW  DoD  8570.01-M,  Paragraph C6.2.2.; thereafter, all users will complete annual cybersecurity awareness refresher training (T-0). This training can be found on the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Information Assurance Support Environment (IASE) portal: http://iase.disa.mil/eta/Pages/index.aspx. This manual  also  identifies  AF  cybersecurity  workforce  positions,  certification  and  qualifications requirements, and provides policy on cybersecurity workforce reporting, metrics and validation Unless noted, the cybersecurity position requirements (e.g. certification, training, etc.) specified in this manual are the minimum required. Commanders are authorized to increase requirements to reflect specific duties and or function(s). 1.2.  Goal.  IAW  DoD  8570.01-M,  the  goal  of  the  Cybersecurity  WIP  is  to  “develop  a  DoD cybersecurity  [IA]  workforce  with  a  common  understanding  of  the  concepts,  principles,  and applications of cybersecurity for each category, level, and function to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,  and  availability  (CIA)  of  DoD  information,  information  systems,  networks  and information stored within.” The Cybersecurity WIP provides warfighters qualified cybersecurity personnel  in  each  category,  specialty  and  level:  Information  Assurance  Technical  (IAT), Information  Assurance  Management  (IAM),  Computer-Network  Defense  -  Service  Providers (CND-SPs),  IA  System  Architects  and  Engineers  (IASAEs),  Authorizing  Officials  (formerly called Designated Accrediting/Approving Authorities [DAAs]), and Assessing Functions. 1.3.  Applicability.  Cybersecurity  workforce  functions  and  associated  DoD  approved  baseline cybersecurity  certifications  are  identified  in  DoD  8570.01-M  by  category  (IAT  and  IAM)  or specialty  (CND-SP  and  IASAE).  The  cybersecurity  workforce  positions  on  a  unit  manning document  (UMD)  will  reflect  the  certification  required  using  established  special  experience identifiers (SEIs). The cybersecurity workforce consists of all civilian, military, and  contractors performing a cybersecurity function IAW DoD 8570.01-M, requires possession of a current/valid cybersecurity  baseline  certification,  and  all  Airmen  who  are  required  to  possess  a  valid/current baseline  cybersecurity  certifications  as  a  precondition  of  their  respective  Air  Force  Specialty Code  (AFSC).  This  manual  applies  to  all  AF  civilian,  military,  and  contractor  (US  citizens, Foreign  Nationals  [FNs],  and  Local  Nationals  [LNs])  personnel  performing  cybersecurity functions  or  tasks  IAW  DoD  Chief  Information  Officer  (DoD  CIO)  policies.  AFMAN  33-285 compliance is required for the Intelligence Community (IC) and Special Access Program (SAP) unless AFMAN conflicts with the Office of Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) or the DoD Director, Special Access Programs Central Office (DoD SAPCO) directives respectfully. When in  conflict,  the  ODNI  and  DoD  SAPCO  Guidance  take  precedence  for  the  IC  and  SAP AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 7 community.  Although  DoD  8570.01-M  requirements  have  been  vetted  through  OSD  legal channels  and  with  National  Unions,  DoD  CIO  has  strongly  recommended  continuous engagements  with  appropriate  local  parties  such  as  the  local  or  country  Human  Resources section of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) or local unions. 1.3.1.  For this manual, the term civilian includes AF employees (US citizens, FNs and LNs) paid by appropriated funds. The definitions for FNs and LNs can be found in DoD 8570.01-M, Appendix 1. 1.3.2.  For  this  manual,  the  term  military  reflects  the  Total  Force  (Active  Air  Force,  Air National  Guard,  and  Air  Force  Reserve  Components).  Also,  the  term  military  includes  US citizens and FNs. 1.3.3.  For the manual, the term contractor includes US citizens, FNs, and LNs. 1.3.4.  For  this  manual,  the  term  major  command  (MAJCOM)  includes  field  operating agency (FOA) and direct reporting unit (DRU). 1.3.5.  For  this  manual,  the  term  Program  Management  Office  (PMO)  is  synonymous  with the Program/Project Manager (PM) or System Manager. PMOs or PMO-like entities manage the  acquisition,  delivery,  and  sustainment  of  information  technology,  including  ISs/PIT systems. 1.3.6.  For this manual, the term IA Managerial (IAM) refers to the management category of 8570-related  certifications,  but  is  not  synonymous  with  the  Information  System  Security Manager (ISSM) (formerly called Information Assurance Manager) position. 1.3.7.  For  this  manual,  the  term  Base/Wing  ISSM  is  synonymous  with  the  Wing Cybersecurity Officer (formerly called Wing Information Assurance Officer). 1.3.8.  For  this  manual,  the  term  AF  8570  Program  (centralized)  funds  refers  to  the budget/funds managed by AF Space Command Cyber Support Squadron (AFSPC CYSS) to pay for both cybersecurity baseline certifications exams and maintenance fees for AF civilian and military personnel. 1.4.  Requirements.  Commanders and supervisors will do the following: identify cybersecurity workforce positions in manpower databases/systems; ensure personnel are trained, certified, and qualified;  record  cybersecurity  workforce  information  in  personnel  systems;  track  and  ensure certifications  are  current;  and  report  certification  status  (T-0).  DoD  has  agreed  to  adhere  to certification  currency  requirements  as  stipulated  by  the  International  Organization  for Standardization/International  Electro-technical  Commission the commercial  cybersecurity  certifications.  For  civilian  and  military  personnel,  the  cybersecurity workforce  information  will  be  recorded  in  manpower  and  personnel  databases/systems  (e.g. Military  Personnel  Data  System  [MILPDS]  and  Defense  Civilian  Personnel  Data  System [DCPDS]),  to  include  but  not  limited  to,  AFSC  or  civilian  occupational  series  (T-0).  For contractors, all cybersecurity requirements, including currency, must be recorded in the contracts (new or modified)/Performance-Based Work Statement (PWS) IAW DoD 8570-01-M, Paragraph C1.4.4.5 (T-0). Details on the contractor cybersecurity workforce must be locally collected and tracked (T-3). (ISO/IEC)  17024 for 1.4.1.  All  AF  workforce  (civilian,  military,  and  contractor)  positions  regardless  of  AFSC, occupational  series,  or  job  title  performing  one  or  more  cybersecurity  functions  must  be 8 AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 identified,  managed,  and  tracked  as  part  of  the  DoD  cybersecurity  workforce  IAW  DoD 8570.01-M, Paragraph C1.4.4.7 (T-0).  Individuals occupying these positions will attain and maintain a DoD approved cybersecurity baseline certification(s) as outlined in DoD 8570.01-M, Paragraph AP2.1.2.1 (T-0).

IAW DoD 8570.01-M, Paragraph  AP1.22,  an individual  who  has  access  to  system  control,  monitoring/security,  administration,  criminal investigation  or  compliance  functions  to  an  IS/PIT  system  must  be  classified  as  an  AF “privileged user,” except for exemption specified in Paragraph  3.2.11 (T-1). 22 AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 3.2.11.  Cybersecurity Baseline Certification Requirement Exemption Process for Individuals Supporting  IS/  PIT  System.  Cybersecurity  is  critical  for  ensuring  information  is  protected and IS/PIT system meets the operational requirements as designed under any cyber situation. Select AF workforce personnel (e.g. aircrew, maintenance, and system technicians) may need limited elevated permissions to perform tasks as required by AF-approved publications (e.g. Technical  Orders,  aids,  software  handbooks,  checklists  and  contractor-developed  technical manual  procedures)  to  facilitate  operation,  troubleshooting  and  repair  of  IS/PIT  system. These  tasks  may  not  require  additional  training,  certifications,  or  qualifications  beyond  the requirements established in publications such as Mission Design Series (MDS) 11 documents and Technical Orders. The AF-approved publications have been vetted and approved by the responsible  AO  to  prevent  the  unauthorized  alteration  of  IS/PIT  system  cybersecurity posture.  An  AO  can  make  a  certification  requirement  determination,  exempting  individuals who  have  limited  elevated  network/system  permissions  to  an  IS/PIT  system.  The determination  must  apply  only  to  IS/PIT  system(s)  under  the  AO’s  authority  and responsibility for risk acceptance. The exemption determination memos must be initiated by Program  Managers,  signed  by  the  ISSM,  and  routed  to  MAJCOM  and  AO  for  in-turn signatures. 3.2.11.1.  The exemption determination memo: 3.2.11.1.1.  Provide a general description of specific IS/PIT system. 3.2.11.1.2.  Provide  details  on  specific  positions,  including  AFSCs/occupational series to be exempted. 3.2.11.1.3.  Provide  rationale  why  a  cybersecurity  baseline  certification  is  not required. 3.2.11.1.3.1.  Include  details  on  specific  actions  to  be  performed  as  required  by AF-approved publications with limited elevated permissions. 3.2.11.1.3.2.  Include  details  on  security  risk  mitigations  implemented  to  enable limited  permissions.  Details  should  include  reference  info  of  AF-approved publications  (e.g.  Technical  Orders,  aids,  software  handbooks,  checklists  and contractor-developed technical manual procedures). 3.2.11.1.4.  Annotate  AO  has  vetted  and  accepted  risk  as  described  in  AF-approved publications. 3.2.11.1.5.  Identify  process  on  how  exempted  personnel  will  be  vetted  initially  and annually. 3.2.11.1.6.  Provide  details  on  the  specialized  training  and  recurrence  of  exempted individuals.    For  example,  personnel  have  to  be  recertified  every  X  months  on checklist procedures by 7-level evaluator or technician. 3.2.11.1.7.  Include  a  statement  that  exempted  individuals  sign  a  user  agreement, stipulating the authorized actions/procedures to be performed. 3.2.11.2.  The PMO or functional  system  owner  will maintain the exemption  memo  (T-1). Also, for recordkeeping purposes, a copy of signed memo must be forwarded to the AF SISO for the affected specific IS/PIT system. AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 23 3.2.11.3.  Exempted  individuals  will  sign  a  user  agreement,  stipulating  the  authorized actions/  procedures  to  be  performed  (T-1).  The  PMO  or  functional  system  owner  will maintain and track these signed user agreements. 3.2.11.4.  Exempted individuals will be classified as an "Authorized User" (T-1). The AF SISO,  for  the  affected  IS/PIT  system,  will  provide  the  instructions  to  request network/system account via DD Form 2875 process for these individuals. 3.2.11.5.  The  PMO  must  complete  and  document  in  memo  format  an  annual  (i.e. occurring on anniversary date of exemption approval) validation of exemption memo to include personnel  and  IS/PIT system  (T-1). The  ISSM will sign the memo and route to the  MAJCOM  and  AO  for  in-turn  signatures  (T-2).  PMOs  must  maintain  and  track validation  memos  locally  (T-2).  For  recordkeeping,  a  copy  of  a  signed  validation  letter must also be forwarded to the AF SISO of the affected IS/PIT system (T-1). 3.2.12.

Also,  the  DoD  approved  certification  must cover knowledge areas, in sufficient detail, secure software development in keeping with the  intentions  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2013,  Section 933  (Improvements  in  Assurance  of  Computer  Software  Procured  by  DoD).  The knowledge  areas  must  include,  but  not  limited  to  secure  software  requirements  and design, secure coding techniques, and secure software deployment strategies) (T-1).   24 AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 3.2.12.3.  Effective  1  April  2018,  all  new  contracts,  modified  contracts,  and  contracts beginning with a new option year must include the following certification requirement for any  contractor  software  developer/engineer/programmer  position  supporting  IS  or  PIT system (T-1): 3.2.12.3.1.  Individuals  will  possess  a  DoD  approved  cybersecurity  baseline certification commensurate to category and level of the assigned position  (T-1). The DoD link: http://iase.disa.mil/iawip/Pages/iabaseline.aspx. approved found this listing can be at 3.2.12.3.2.  The DoD approved certification, also, must cover knowledge areas in the secure software development life cycle (e.g. secure software requirements and design, secure coding techniques, and secure software deployment strategies) (T-1). 3.2.12.4.  By  1  October  2018,  PMO/unit  must  have  all  assigned  civilian  and  military positions  filled  by  individuals  possessing  a  DoD  approved  cybersecurity  baseline certification (T-0). Also, the DoD approved certification must cover knowledge areas, in sufficient  detail,  in  the  secure  software  development  life  cycle  (e.g.  secure  software requirements  and  design,  secure  coding  techniques,  and  secure  software  deployment strategies) (T-1). 3.2.12.5.  This  mandate  does  not  apply  to  software  developer/engineer/programmer positions that do not support either an IS/PIT system. Also, this mandate does not include web site administrators such as SharePoint or others who incorporate pre-built modules in their organizational web sites. 3.2.13.  Wing Cybersecurity Office (WCO). 3.2.13.1.  The Base/Wing ISSM will attain and maintain at a minimum an IAM Level II cybersecurity baseline certification (T-1). 3.2.13.2.

The AF link: https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/SAFCIOA6/A6S/A6SF/8570/default.aspx.  Those  certifications on the AF preferred list have priority for funding. preferred found can be list at this 5.2.2.  Even though AF has a preferred list, personnel can attain/maintain certification from the DoD approved cybersecurity baseline certification list that is category/specialty and level specified for the assigned position. 5.3.  Minimum Cybersecurity Baseline Certification Requirement for Five Enlisted AFSCs (3D0X2,  3D0X3,  3D1X1,  3D1X2,  and  1B4X1).  Certain  military  enlisted  personnel  have mandatory  certification  requirements.  Personnel  in  the  3D0X2,  3D0X3,  3D1X2,  and  1B4X1 AFSCs  will  attain  and  maintain,  at  a  minimum,  an  IAT  Level  II  cybersecurity  baseline certification  (T-1).  Personnel  in  the  3D1X1  AFSC  will  attain  and  maintain,  at  a  minimum,  an IAT Level I cybersecurity baseline certification, effective until 30 October 2015 (T-1). Effective 31 October 2015, the 3D1X1 AFSC will transition to a new minimum certification, an IAT Level II cybersecurity baseline certification  (T-1). All 3D1X1 personnel will attain and maintain, at a minimum,  an  IAT  Level  II  cybersecurity  baseline  certification  by  31  October  2016  (T-1). Personnel  in  these  five  career  fields  will  maintain  currency  in  a  DoD  approved  certification applicable  to  category  (T-1).  Note:  A  higher  level  certification  may  be  required  for  assigned position. 5.3.1.  Exam.  AF  centralized  funds  pay  for  one  (1)  exam  voucher  at  the  specified  AFSC requirement unless member occupies an assigned position with different/higher cybersecurity requirements. 5.3.1.1.  Through  30  October  2015,  personnel  in  3D1X1  AFSC  can  request  one  exam voucher for either an IAT Level I or IAT Level II cybersecurity baseline certification. 5.3.1.2.  AF  centralized  funds  will  pay  for  additional  exam  voucher(s)  from  the  AF preferred  list  when  individual  is  assigned  to  a  cybersecurity  coded  position  requiring  a AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 33 higher  level  certification  requirement,  certification  in  a  new  category/specialty,  or multiple cybersecurity baseline certifications. 5.3.2.  Maintenance. Civilian and military personnel will comply with Paragraph  5.8 (T-1). 5.3.3.  Military  personnel  in  3D0X2,  3D0X3,  3D1X1,  3D1X2,  and  1B4X1  AFSCs  will maintain  the  highest  level  baseline  certification  attained  in  good  standing,  to  meet  AFSC requirement, even while serving in a joint or special duty assignment (T-1). 5.3.4.  3D  CMSgts/SMSgts.  Cybersecurity  certifications  are  not  mandatory  for  3D CMSgts/SMSgts,  except  for  those  members  assigned  to  cybersecurity-coded  positions.  The AF  centralized  funds  will  pay  certification  maintenance  fees  for  those  individuals  already possessing a DoD-approved certification off the AF preferred list. The AF centralized funds will not provide exam vouchers for new certifications for CMSgts and SMSgts unless filling a cybersecurity-coded position. 5.4.  Future Minimum Cybersecurity Baseline Certification Requirements for 17X Officer Career  Field.  To  be  prepared  for  the  future  and  fast-paced  challenges  in  cyberspace,  17Xs require a solid foundation in cybersecurity.   Graduates of Undergraduate Cyber Training (UCT) will  continue  to  attain  IAM  Level  I  cybersecurity  baseline  certification  as  a  precondition  for matriculation into the career field (T-1).  The intention is for the 17X Company Grade Officers (CGOs)  (O-1  to  O-3  ranks)  to  possess,  at  a  minimum,  an  IAM  Level  I  cybersecurity  baseline.  Going forward, 17X Field Grade Officers (FGOs) (O-4 to O-5 ranks) will attain and maintain, at a  minimum,  an  IAM  Level  II  cybersecurity  baseline  certification  demonstrating  increased foundational  knowledge  and  continued  professional  progression  (T-1).    Certifications  for Colonels  will  be  based  upon  assigned  position  requirements.    The  17X  career  field  manager  is OPR for implementation guidance and policy. 5.4.1.  If  assigned  to  cybersecurity-coded  position,  17X  officers  will  attain  required cybersecurity baseline certification within six (6) months of duty assignment (T-1). 5.4.2.  Exam  Vouchers.    Effective  immediately,  AF  centralized  funds  will  pay  for  one  (1) Level I exam voucher from the AF preferred list for a CGO and one (1) IAM Level II exam voucher for 17X Captains, Majors and Lieutenant Colonels.  Caveat:  17X officers, who use AF funds to attain IAM Level I certification as a Captain, must wait 18 months before they can request an IAM Level II exam voucher (T-1). Otherwise, 17X Captains are encouraged to  pursue  their  IAM  Level  II  certification  prior  to  promotion  to  the  rank  of  Major.  Attainment of IAM Level I is not a prerequisite to attain IAM Level II. 5.4.2.1.  AF  centralized  funds  will  pay  for  additional  exam  voucher(s)  from  the  AF preferred list when an individual is assigned to a cybersecurity coded position requiring a higher  level  certification  requirement,  certification  in  a  new  category/specialty,  or multiple cybersecurity baseline certifications. An example is a 17X CGO is assigned to a cybersecurity-coded position, requiring an IAM Level III certification. 5.4.3.  Maintenance. Individuals must comply with Paragraph  5.8 (T-0). 5.4.4.  Once cybersecurity  baseline certification is attained, 17X officers  will maintain their baseline certification in good standing, even while serving in a joint assignment, special duty assignment or deployment (T-1). 34 AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 5.5.

This  section  applies  to  every  military member  who  fails  cybersecurity  baseline  certification  exams  or  does  not  possess  the  required cybersecurity baseline within six months of assignment of duties. Likewise, this section applies to  civilians  who  do  not  possess  the  required  cybersecurity  baseline  within  six  months  of assignment of duties. Furthermore, this section applies to civilians, military, and contractors who become decertified.  Military and civilians may be subject to administrative action if they do not attain or maintain baseline certifications. 5.6.1.  Except for re-testing conducted at schoolhouses, AF centralized funds will not pay for any re-testing required after an initial exam failure or decertification for civilians or military. SAF/CIO  A6  may  make  exceptions  on  a  case-by-case  basis.  The  individual  will  be responsible for paying to re-test. The PMOs/units may fund with internal resources for a re-testing. 5.6.2.  Civilian,  military,  and  contractor  personnel  who  fail  to  maintain  certification(s)  in good  standing  will  not  be  allowed  privileged  access  IAW  DoD  8570.01-M,  Paragraph C3.2.4.6 (T-0). 5.6.3.  Civilian  Personnel.  If  a  civilian  has  not  attained  a  DoD  approved  cybersecurity baseline certification commensurate to category and level of the assigned position within six months  of  assignment,  then  the  civilian  will  not  perform  any  assigned  cybersecurity  duties unless  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  cybersecurity  certified  individual  (T-1).  The commander  determines  appropriate  actions  IAW  civilian  personnel  policies  if  civilian  does not  attain  requisite  cybersecurity  baseline  certification(s)  within  six  months  of  duty assignment. 5.6.3.1.  Primary  Duty.  The  commander  will  immediately  contact  the  servicing  civilian personnel section and local administrative procedures will be followed (T-3). 5.6.3.2.  Additional  Duty.  Those  additional  duties  (cybersecurity)  must  be  reassigned  to another  individual  who  has  the  appropriate  certification  in  good  standing  (T-1).  The AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 35 commander will have the discretion to allow individuals to resume additional duties, once baseline certification is attained. 5.6.3.3.  Embedded Duty. Those  embedded duties (cybersecurity) must be reassigned to another  individual  who  has  the  appropriate  certification  in  good  standing  (T-1).  The commander  will  have  the  discretion  to  allow  individuals  to  resume  embedded  duties, once baseline certification is achieved. 5.6.4.  Military  Personnel.  Military  personnel  who  fail  their  initial  cybersecurity  baseline certification  exam  may  be  placed  in  remedial  supervised  training  (e.g.  CBTs,  hands-on training,  or  instructor-led  training).  If  a  military  member  has  not  attained  a  DoD  approved cybersecurity baseline certification commensurate to category and level of assigned position within  six  months  of  assignment,  then  the  commanders  of  PMOs/units  will  reassign cybersecurity  duties  to  another  individual  who  has  the  appropriate  certification  in  good standing  (T-1).    Commanders  will  adhere  to  Attachment  3  for  the  Military  Certification Failure Matrix (T-1). 5.6.4.1.  The  commander  should  meet  with  both  the  supervisor  and  military  member  to reassess  whether  the  individual  possesses  the  necessary  skills  to  perform  in  a cybersecurity  position.  This  assessment  should  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  an individual’s  aptitude,  motivation,  experience,  and  knowledge  level  to  perform  in  a cybersecurity position. 5.6.4.2.  Initial  Certification  Attainment.    Where  attainment  of  a  cybersecurity  baseline certification  is  a  requirement  for  matriculation  (i.e.  entry)  into  an  AFSC,  commanders will begin AFSC disqualification actions IAW AFI 36-2101, Paragraph 4.1 after second test  failure  (T-1).    Otherwise,  commanders  of  PMOs/units  have  the  discretion  to  retain the individual or pursue other appropriate administrative actions. 5.6.4.3.  If  the  military  member  is  retained,  supervisors  should  validate  the  member’s readiness for re-testing and ensure the person is scheduled to retake the certification. 5.6.5.  Contractors.  Contractor  personnel  will  meet  certification  requirements  as  outlined  in their contract and will not be assigned nor perform any cybersecurity duties in which they are not  certified  IAW  DoD  8570.01-M,  Paragraph  C2.3.9  (T-0).  Timelines  for  contractor software  developers/engineers/programmers  to  be  certified  are  noted  in  Paragraph  3.2.8. Any issues concerning contract cybersecurity certification requirements should be addressed through the procuring contracting office. 5.6.6.  Decertification:  Decertification  includes  those  individuals  whose  certifications  are terminated  or  expired  (e.g.  failure  to  meet  CEU  standards,  failure  to  pay  maintenance  fees, etc.). Decertification equates to an “exam failure”.  If decertification occurs for the following individuals, the commander of the PMO/unit: 5.6.6.1.  Military.  Has the discretion to retain the individual or pursue other appropriate administrative actions. 5.6.6.2.  Civilian.  Determines  the  appropriate  action(s)  IAW  local  civilian  personnel policies if civilian has not maintained requisite cybersecurity baseline certification(s). If desired, has the discretion to allow up to six (6) months additional time for recertification. However,  the  commander  of  PMO/unit  will  reassign  cybersecurity  duties  to  another 36 AFMAN33-285  20 MARCH 2015 individual  who  has  the  appropriate  certification  in  good  standing  until  recertification  is achieved (T-1). 5.6.6.3.  Contractor. Must immediately remove the individual from the position according to contract provisions and in coordination with the CO (T-0). 5.7.  Continuing Education Units (CEUs).  DoD approved cybersecurity baseline certifications require  CEUs  to  stay  current.  Commercial  certification  providers  define  the  criteria  for acceptable  continuing  education  units.  All  certification  holders  (civilians,  military,  and contractors)  will  adhere  to  CEU  policies  set  by  their  respective  certification  provider(s)  IAW DoD 8570.01-M, Paragraph C3.2.3.7 (T-0). Some commercial certification providers may allow CEUs for work experience that is documented and verified. Also, CBTs may count toward CEUs (please  check  with  the  commercial  certification  provider)  and  are  available  via  various  DoD resources such as the AF e-Learning program for civilians and military.
