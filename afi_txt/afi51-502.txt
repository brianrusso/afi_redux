Purpose.  The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees Claims Act (PCA), 31 USC 3701 &  3721,  is  a  gratuitous  payment  statute.    Congress  passed  the  PCA  to  lessen  the  hardships  of military life by providing prompt and fair payment for certain types of property loss or damage.  Payment  does  not  depend  on  tort  liability  or  Government  fault.    Most  common  is  loss  of  or damage  to  property  that  occurred  during  a  government-directed  move  or  while  residing  in government  housing.    The  Air  Force  aims,  within  approved  guidelines,  to  compensate  military members  and  civilian  employees  for  property  loss  or  damage,  incident  to  their  service,  to  the maximum  extent  possible.    However,  the  PCA  does  not  provide  insurance  coverage  and  is  not designed to make the United States (US) a total insurer of the personal property of claimants. 1.1.1.  PCA  payments  are  not  based  on  negligence  by  either  the  Air  Force  or  by  Air  Force personnel acting within the scope of employment. 1.1.2.  Recovery under the PCA is based on the member’s or civilian employee’s status at the time of the loss (that is, the loss is incident to service). 1.1.3.  Generally, PCA claims are processed by the Air Force Claims Service Center (CSC). 1.1.4.  Claims based on tortious liability are processed in accordance with AFI 51-501, Tort Claims.  Note:  it is critical to establish whether a claim is being processed under the PCA or as a Tort claim. 1.2.  Authority.  The  Air  Force  may  pay  meritorious  claims  for  loss  of  or  damage  to  personal property of members and civilian employees of the Air Force incident to service under: 1.2.1.  The Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act (PCA), 31 USC §§ 3701 and 3721. 1.2.2.  Full Replacement Value (FRV) Claims Program.  The John Warner National Defense Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2007  mandated  that  contracts  for  the  transportation  at government  expense  of  baggage  and  household  effects  of  military  personnel  and  civilian employees  of  the  DoD  include  FRV  protection  (see  Public  Law  109-364  and  10  USC  § 2636a).  The FRV Claims Program has been implemented through various sources, including the Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR).  To benefit from this program,  members file claims  for  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  directly  against  the  Transportation  Service  Provider (TSP)  within  9  months  of  delivery.    Claims  for  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  may  be  filed against the TSP through the Defense Personal Property System (DPS).  Claims filed through DPS may be transferred, in total or an item at a time, to the Air Force when appropriate (see paragraph 1.2.2.1).  Claims filed directly against a TSP using a method other than DPS may be transferred to the Air Force as directed by the CSC.  While many of the principles found in this instruction are relevant to the FRV Claims Program, only claims for loss, damage, or destruction of household goods filed directly against the Air Force, or claims against a TSP and  properly  transferred  to  the  Air  Force  by  a  member,  are  within  the  scope  of  this instruction.  Payments for loss, damage, or destruction under this chapter may be affected by payments under the FRV Claims Program. 8 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 1.2.2.1.  If claims negotiations with the TSP are unsuccessful, claimants may transfer the claim and file against the Air Force through the CSC.  The CSC will adjudicate and pay claims against the Air Force for damage to or loss of personal property under the PCA.  (T-1)    Except  as  noted  in  Paragraph  1.2.2.2.,  all  claims  are  paid  at  depreciated  value.  Claimants assign any right to recover from the TSP to the Air Force when they make a claim against the Air Force.  The CSC will pursue payment from the responsible TSP to the extent of the TSP’s legal liability up to FRV.  (T-2)  The CSC will make additional payments  to  claimants  if  the  recovery  from  the  TSP  is  greater  than  the  initial  payment CSC made to the claimant.  (T-1) 1.2.2.2.  The  Ike  Skelton  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2011 authorizes  the  military  departments  to  pay  FRV  under  the  PCA  for  personnel  claims involving the shipment of baggage and household effects of military members or civilian employees  of  the  DoD  under  certain  circumstances  (see  Public  Law  111-383  and  10 U.S.C.  §  2740).    In  paying  a  claim  under  section  3721  of  title  31  arising  from  loss  or damage  to  household  goods  stored  or  transported  at  the  expense  of  the  Department  of Defense, the Air Force may pay the claim on the basis of full replacement value in any of the following cases in which reimbursement for the full replacement value for the loss or damage is not available directly from a carrier under 10 USC 2636a: 1.2.2.2.1.  A  case  in  which  the  lost  or  damaged  goods  were  stored  or  transported under  a  contract,  tender,  or  solicitation  in  accordance  with  10  USC  2636a  that requires  the  transportation  service  provider  to  settle  claims  on  the  basis  of  full replacement value; and the loss or damage occurred under circumstances that exclude the transportation service provider from liability. 1.2.2.2.2.  A  case  in  which  the  loss  or  damage  occurred  while  the  lost  or  damaged goods  were  in  the  possession  of  an  ocean  carrier  that  was  transporting,  loading,  or unloading the goods under a Department of Defense contract for ocean carriage; and the land-based portions of the transportation were under contracts, in accordance with 10  USC  2636a,  that  require  the  land  carriers  to  settle  claims  on  the  basis  of  full replacement value. 1.2.2.2.3.  A  case  in  which  the  lost  or  damaged  goods  were  transported  or  stored under a contract or solicitation that requires at least one of the transportation service providers  or  carriers  that  handled  the  shipment  to  settle  claims  on  the  basis  of  full replacement value pursuant to 10 USC 2636a; the lost or damaged goods have been in the  custody  of  more  than  one  independent  contractor  or  transportation  service provider;  and  a  claim  submitted  to  the  delivering  transportation  service  provider  or carrier  is  denied  in  whole  or  in  part  because  the  loss  or  damage  occurred  while  the lost or damaged goods were in the custody of a prior transportation service provider or carrier or government entity. 1.3.

Scope.  This  chapter  defines  what  a  proper  PCA  claim  is  under  the  law.    Guidance  on administrating, processing, adjudicating, and paying PCA claims may be found in Chapter 3 of this Instruction. 2.2.  Defining  PCA  Claims.  The  PCA  sets  forth  basic  requirements  for  what  constitutes  a properly  payable  claim.    This  chapter  explains  these  requirements.    Claims  personnel  must analyze claims to determine whether the following requirements exist in each case: (T-0) 2.2.1.  A Proper Claimant (Chapter 2, Section B). 2.2.2.  Loss or Damage Incident to Service (Chapter 2, Section C). 2.2.3.  The Timely and Proper Presentation of a Claim (Chapter 2, Section D). 2.2.4.  An Appropriate Loss (Chapter 2, Section E). 2.2.5.  Loss  or  Damage  to  Property  that  was  Reasonable  or  Useful  to  Possess  (Chapter  2, Section F). 2.3.  Finality.  In  accordance  with  31  USC  §  3721(k),  Air  Force  administrative  settlements  of PCA claims are final and conclusive.  Claimants do not have a right to pursue their claim in any court of law (i.e., not subject to judicial review). 2.4.  Recovery under PCA Subject to All Other Sources.  Claimant’s recovery under the PCA is  subject  to  recovery  from  any  other  source.    Claimants  who  have  received  compensation  for loss or damage from an insurance company, tortfeasor, carrier, contractor or warehouseman, or any other source may not receive a duplicate award for the same loss or damage under the PCA.  Claimants have an affirmative obligation to inform the Air Force of any recovery received both prior  to  and  after  filing  a  claim  under  the  PCA.    Claims  personnel  must  ensure  all  awards  are deducted accordingly.  (T-0) 2.5.  Disclaiming  or  Waiving  Liability.  Generally,  unilateral  disclaimers  (on  signs  or  other postings), as to liability for loss or damage to personal property, do not prevent claimants from making an otherwise valid claim under the PCA.  However, claimants may sign an agreement or contract  in  which  they  waive  their  right  to  file  in  consideration  for  some  benefit.    All  such agreements should clearly and prominently state that, upon signing, the party waives his or her right to file a claim under the PCA. 2.6.  Relation  to  Other  Claims  Statutes.  Claim personnel must first assess whether all claims by Air Force employees and military members are payable under the PCA.  (T-0)  If, consistent with this Instruction, a claim is determined not to be payable under the PCA, it shall be reviewed under  other  applicable  claims  statutes,  such  as  the  Military  Claims  Act  (MCA)  or  the  Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), before it is denied.  (T-0)  The CSC provides the member or employee with appropriate guidance. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 13 2.6.1.  Vehicle  Claims  Exception.    Incident-to-service  damage  to  vehicles  caused  by  the negligence of a member or employee of the armed forces acting in the scope of employment is  investigated  and potentially paid  under the MCA first,  rather than the PCA.  (CAVEAT:  Incident-to-service damage to vehicles caused by the negligence of a member or employee of the armed forces acting in the scope of employment that involves damage because of contact with  a  quarters  (including  landscaping  of  quarters)  is  still  investigated  and  if  appropriate, paid under the PCA, rather than the MCA.) 2.6.2.  Article 139, UCMJ Claims Exception.  If a claim  is  cognizable under Article 139 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), it should be investigated and potentially paid under that process first (see AFI 51-501). 2.7.  Handling Claims Resulting From Negligent Acts of Third Parties.  Generally, claims for which a third party may be liable should not be paid under the PCA.  Exceptions to this rule may be  found  in  Paragraph  2.24  and  include  Government  Bill  of  Lading  (GBL)  carriers,  contract carriers, and warehousemen.  Claims personnel can refer claimants who suffer loss or damage to personal  property  resulting  from  the  fault  or  negligence  of  a  GBL  carrier,  Contract  Carrier,  or warehouseman (collectively referred to as Transportation Service Providers or TSPs) who moved or  stored  their  goods  (HHGs  and  POV  claims)  to  the  carrier  or  warehouseman  if  the  shipment moved  under  a  Full  Replacement  Value  contract.    While  claimants  maintain  their  independent right  to  file  a  claim  against  a  carrier,  contractor  or  warehouseman,  they  may  file  such  claims directly against the Air Force under the PCA. Section 2B— 2.8.  Who May File a Claim.  These individuals may file a claim: 2.8.1.  A proper claimant. 2.8.2.  An authorized agent or legal representative of a proper claimant. 2.8.3.  A survivor of a deceased proper claimant.  See Paragraph 2.10. 2.9.  Defining  Proper  Claimants.  The  following  categories  of  individuals  qualify  as  proper claimants under the PCA: 2.9.1.  Active duty Air Force personnel. 2.9.2.  Retired or separated Air Force military personnel who suffer loss or damage resulting from the last entitled storage or movement of their personal property. 2.9.3.  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  personnel  for an incident that occurs while they are performing federally funded active duty, inactive duty for training, or full-time National Guard duty. 2.9.4.  ANG technicians under 32 USC § 709. 2.9.5.  Civilian employees whom the Air Force pays from appropriated funds. 2.9.6.  Civilian employees of the Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) who work on an Air Force installation. 2.9.7.  DoD Dependent School (DoDDS) teachers and administrative personnel employed at schools on or serviced by Air Force installations. 14 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 2.9.8.  AF  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  cadets  while  traveling  at  Government expense or on active duty for summer training. 2.9.9.  US Air Force Academy cadets. 2.10.  Survivors of Deceased Proper Claimants. 2.10.1.  Survivors  of  deceased  proper  claimants  may  file  a  claim  for  the  decedent’s  loss.  Only one survivor may file.  The following is a list of proper survivors in order of priority: 2.10.1.1.  Spouse. 2.10.1.2.  Child. 2.10.1.3.  Father or mother. 2.10.1.4.  Brother or sister. 2.10.2.  The  highest  priority  survivor  may  file  a  claim.    If  two  or  more  people  are  equal  in order, the first claim filed eliminates the right of all others to file. 2.10.3.  The  estate  of  a  deceased  claimant  is  not  a  proper  claimant,  nor  is  an  executor  or personal representative. 2.11.  Members or Employees of Other Armed Forces or Agencies. 2.11.1.  By  agreement  among  the  services,  the  gaining  service  processes  a  personnel transportation  claim  from  a  civilian  employee  transferring  to  that  service.    This  includes civilian  employees  who  have  gone  from  active  duty  in  a  military  service  to  civilian employment with a different service (the gaining service). 2.11.2.  The  services  have  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  that  the  service controlling  the  installation  where  a  DeCA  claimant  is  assigned  adjudicates  and  settles  that claimant's personnel claims. 2.12.  Joint Spouses as Proper Claimants.  Military members married to military members are each proper claimants. 2.12.1.  Each  individual  may  file  a  claim  for  his  or  her  separate  or  jointly  owned  property, but should ensure that no duplication exists between their claim and the spouse’s claim. 2.12.2.  If no duplication exists, each member may receive up to the statutory maximum. 2.13.  Defining Those Who Are Not Proper Claimants.  Persons, organizations, or groups that do  not  fall  into  any  of  the  categories  in  paragraphs  2.9  through  2.12  are  not  proper  claimants, agents or survivors, and the CSC denies such claims.  Examples of improper claimants include: 2.13.1.  Insurers, subrogees, and assignees of proper claimants and other similar third parties. 2.13.2.  Lien holders and conditional vendors. 2.13.3.  Employees of Government contractors. 2.13.4.  Independent contractors. 2.13.5.  Red Cross and United Service Organization (USO) personnel. 2.13.6.  Military personnel of foreign governments. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 15 2.13.7.  Former spouses and other ex-family members are not proper claimants, even if they receive  property  by  court  order.    Former  spouses  and  other  ex-family  members  may  file  a claim only as a proper claimant's agent in accordance with paragraph 2.15. 2.14.  Nonappropriated  Fund  Instrumentality  (NAFI)  Employees.  NAFI employees are not proper claimants under the PCA.  However, such claims are accepted  and processed consistent with this Instruction and forwarded to the NAFI for action.  Claims personnel shall never pay a NAFI claim under the PCA using appropriated funds.  (T-0) 2.14.1.  NAFIs  include  the  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  and  other instrumentalities  of  the  Air  Force  supported  by  nonappropriated  funds  as  described  in  AFI 34-201, Use of Nonappropriated Funds (NAFS). 2.14.2.  While NAFI employees are not  proper  claimants under the PCA and the CSC does not  pay  their  claims,  the  CSC  receives,  processes,  adjudicates,  and  settles  such  personnel claims  consistent  with  this  Instruction.    The  CSC  then  forwards  the  file  to  the  proper authority  for  payment.    This  may  include  initial  assertion  of  carrier,  contractor,  or warehouseman recovery claims. 2.14.3.  Forward all AAFES claims payable for any amount to:  HQ AAFES, FA-T/RM, P. O. Box 650428, Dallas, TX 75265-0428. 2.14.4.  Send  civilian  welfare  NAFI  claims  for  payment  or  collection  of  more  than  $100  to Air  Force  Civilian  Welfare  Fund,  2261  Hughes  Ave.,  Ste  156,  Lackland  Air  Force  Base, Texas 78236, and for $100 or less to the local civilian welfare NAFI which gave rise to the claim. 2.14.5.  Send all other Air Force NAFI claims for payment or collection of $500 or more to AF  Services  Agency  (HQ  AFPC/SVXHI,  2261  Hughes  Ave.,  Ste  156,  Lackland  Air  Force Base, Texas 78236), and for less than $500 to the local NAFI which gave rise to the claim. 2.15.  Claims Filed by Agents.  The authorized agent of a proper claimant may file on behalf of the claimant if the agent has been granted power of attorney or granted guardianship through a court order.  The proper claimant can also authorize their spouse (not any other person) via the website.  The CSC website provides the spouse a user  ID and password to allow the spouse to file  on  the  claimant’s  behalf.    NOTE:  It  is  not  appropriate  for  a  claimant  to  simply  provide  a spouse  or  agent  the  claimant’s  user  ID  and  password  without  a  power  of  attorney  or  spousal authorization.    With  a  power  of  attorney,  spouses  or  agents  receive  their  own  user  ID  and password to file on behalf of the claimant. in  paper 2.16.  What Constitutes a Claim.  A claim is a written and signed demand against the US or the Air  Force  for  a  sum  certain  (a  specified  or  determinable  amount  of  money).    Claims  may  be submitted the  Air  Force  CSC  website (https://claims.jag.af.mil)  or  through  e-mail  or  fax  timely  received  by  proper  authority,  or transferred from an official DoD claims website.  Only one claim may be filed based on a single incident, giving rise to loss or damage.  Multiple claims for loss or damage by a claimant based upon a single incident are combined and adjudicated as a single claim. form,  electronically  online  at 2.16.1.  For specific information on the filing process, see paragraph 2.27. 2.16.2.  Signature authenticity.  All signatures are presumed to be authentic unless evidence exists to cause claims personnel to question the signature. 16 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 2.17.  What Constitutes an Amendment to an Existing Claim.  A request for indemnification for  loss  of  or  damage  to  personal  property  due  to  an  incident  that  serves  as  the  basis  of  an existing  claim  is  an  amendment  to  that  claim  and  not  a  new  claim.    For  an  amendment  to  be considered payable under the PCA, the claimants file the amended claim prior to the expiration of  the  statute  of  limitations.    Claimants  amend  the  claim  by  submitting  a  written  and  signed demand or an email to a proper authority at the CSC for specified payment for additional  items of  personal  property  lost,  damaged,  or  destroyed  as  a  result  of  the  same  incident.    An  increase only in the dollar amount claimed for an item is not an amendment, and claimants may request such increases, even after the statute of limitations expires. 2.18.  What Constitutes Separate Claims.  A request for indemnification for loss of or damage to personal property due to an incident that has not served as the basis of another claim is a new claim,  regardless  of  how  many  claims  the  claimant  has  pending.    A  claimant  files  a  separate claim  for  each  incident  that  causes  loss  or  damage.    For  personnel  transportation  claims, claimants file separate claims for each shipment, but usually not for multiple deliveries from the same shipment. Section 2C— 2.19.  Loss  or  Damage  Incident  to  Service  Required.  By the terms of the PCA, only loss or damage  incident  to  service  is  payable.    Loss  or  damage  is  incident  to  service,  if  it  occurs  at  a place  and  time  that  is  connected  with  the  service  of  an  active  duty  military  member  or employment  of  a  civilian  employee.    The  connection  between  service  or  employment  and  the cause of property loss also play a role in making the determination. 2.20.  Active-Duty  Military  Members  (Loss  Incident  to  Service).  Because  active-duty military  members  are  considered  to  be  on  duty  24  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week,  the determination of whether a claimed loss was incident to service will hinge on: (1) the place and (2)  cause  of  the  loss.    Paragraphs  2.23  and  2.24  list  the  locations  and  causes  of  loss  that  are deemed incident to service. 2.21.  Civilian  Employees  (Loss  Incident  to  Service).  Determining  whether  a  civilian employee’s  loss  or  damage  is  incident  to  service  is  often  more  challenging  than  with  military members.  There may be occasions where the Air Force does not pay for a civilian employee’s loss  or  damage,  even  though  it  may  pay  for  the  same  loss  or  damage  as  incident  to  a  military member's service.  In order for a civilian’s loss or damage claim to be considered as incident to service, claims personnel consider and document the following:  (1) the time and place the loss or damage occurred, and (2) a direct connection to the civilian’s employment or duty. 2.21.1.  Time.    Generally,  loss  or  damage  should  occur  during  actual  duty  hours  to  be incident to service.  Loss or damage occurring outside duty hours, while on leave or during break time (lunch), is not usually incident to a civilian employee's service.   However, there may  be  circumstances  when  claims  for  loss  or  damage  occurring  outside  of  duty  hours  are payable.    Such  claims  are  considered  on  a  case  by  case  basis.    Time  spent  at  temporary quarters while on TDY or Permanent Change of Station (PCS) orders are incident to service. 2.21.2.  Place.    Incident  to  service  losses  or  damage  occur  at  the  employee’s  duty  location (the duty location at the time of loss). AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 17 2.21.3.  Cause of Loss.  Paragraph 2.24 sets out causes and types of loss that (if occurring at the appropriate time and place) are incident to service. 2.21.4.  Civilians  Assigned  Outside  the  US.    Special  criteria  apply  to  claims  of  civilian employees outside the US. When civilian employees are assigned, on official orders, outside the  US,  including  US  territories  and  possessions,  their  homes  may  be  authorized  places incident to their service.  This is true even for damage that occurs during non-duty hours. 2.22.  Property Must be Properly Located at an Authorized Place.  In order for a claim to be payable, the claimed property must be properly located at an authorized place.  Property damage at an authorized place is presumed to be properly located, unless evidence exists to suggest that its  placement  was  unreasonable  under  the  circumstances.    In  other  words,  there  must  be  some connection  between  the  claimant’s  service  and  the  location  of  the  property.    This  service connection exists, not only when the member is performing official duties, but also whenever the claimant  or  family  members  living  with  the  claimant  possess  property  while  participating  in activities  or  using  facilities  open  to  them  only  by  virtue  of  the  claimant’s  status  as  a  military member.  In situations where no connection to military service can be perceived, the claim is not payable. 2.23.  Locations  Incident  to  Service  (Quarters  and  Other  Authorized  Places).  Settlement authorities  pay  for  loss  or  damage  only  if  it  occurs  at  authorized  places.    Authorized  places include: 2.23.1.  Government  Housing.  Government-owned or Government-leased housing assigned or  otherwise  provided  to  a  military  member  is  considered  an  authorized  place.    The  PCA specifically  prohibits  payment  for  loss  or  damage  in  quarters  within  the  US  that  the Government does not assign or provide. 2.23.1.1.  Privatized  Housing.    Privatized  housing  is  housing  provided  to  a  member  by the Air Force (in kind) through contracts, leases, financing and other agreements with a third party and can be located both on and off military installations. 2.23.1.2.  Privatized  housing  is  considered  Government  housing  for  the  purposes  of  the PCA, provided housing is within the fence line of a military installation or on federal land in which the DoD has interest. 2.23.2.  Quarters  Outside  the  US.    Outside  the  US,  authorized  off-base  quarters,  as  well  as assigned quarters, including quarters in US territories and possessions, are authorized places.  This is true of both military members and civilian employees. 2.23.2.1.  Settlement  authorities  do  not  consider  a  civilian  employee’s  residence  an authorized place if the claimant is a local inhabitant. 2.23.2.1.1.  Consider an overseas civilian employee, who is not a US citizen, to be a local inhabitant. 2.23.2.1.2.  Consider  a  US  citizen,  who  becomes  a  civilian  employee  while  residing abroad, to be a local inhabitant. 2.23.3.  TDY  Quarters.    Authorized  temporary  quarters  anywhere,  including  hotels,  motels, guesthouses,  dormitories,  and  billeting  rooms  that  the  claimant  occupies  during  TDY  are authorized places.  Temporary quarters during permissive TDY are only authorized places if on a military installation. 18 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 2.23.4.  PCS temporary quarters locations.  Temporary quarters when a member or employee is in PCS status are authorized places.  However, if a claimant significantly deviated from a direct travel route, the location is not an authorized place. 2.23.5.  Travel En Route.  Locations en route pursuant to travel on Government PCS or TDY orders  are  authorized  places.    However,  if  claims  personnel  determine  the  claimant significantly  deviated  from  a  direct  travel  route,  the  location  is  not  an  authorized  place.  Permissive TDY locations en route are not authorized places. 2.23.6.  Privately Owned Vehicles Parked at an Authorized Place.  Privately owned vehicles parked at an authorized place are themselves authorized places.  Damage to or loss of items in the vehicle or to the vehicle may be paid if the time and cause of loss are also incident to service  and  otherwise  payable  under  the  PCA.    However,  privately  owned  vehicles  are  not authorized places if: 2.23.6.1.  The vehicle is being driven for routine use such as to and from a duty location. 2.23.6.2.  The owner has failed to register or insure the vehicle in compliance with state laws or Air Force requirements. 2.23.7.  Privately  Owned  Vehicles  Authorized  for  Official  Use.    When  a  claimant  is authorized  by  the  Government  to  use  a  privately  owned  vehicle  during  military  duty,  that vehicle is  an authorized  place, i.e., the  claimant is authorized to  drive his  or her POV on  a TDY.  Damage to or loss of items in the vehicle or to the vehicle may be paid if the time and cause  of  loss  are  also  incident  to  service.    Orders,  or  other  documentary  evidence,  must reflect authorization to use a POV at the time an incident occurs before any claim for loss or damage can be adjudicated in favor of the claimant. 2.23.8.  Personal  Property  Shipped  or  Stored  at  Government  Expense.    Goods  in  the possession  of  a  TSP,  contractor,  or  warehouseman  while  being  shipped  or  stored  at Government  expense  are  in  authorized  places.    Government  facilities  where  property  is stored  at  the  claimant’s  expense  or  for  their  convenience  without  an  entitlement  are  NOT authorized places for the purpose of this provision.  Examples of locations that would not be authorized for the purposes of this provision include but are not limited to: 2.23.8.1.  Resale lots (to include “Lemon Lots”). 2.23.8.2.  Storage lots such as recreational vehicle lots, marinas, or any location designed or utilized for the sole purpose of storing personal property. 2.23.9.  Personal Property Otherwise Shipped or Stored. 2.23.9.1.  When  a  claimant  is  entitled  to  file  a  claim  for  delivery  out  of  storage  at Government  expense  after  a  period  of  both  Government  storage  and  storage  at  the claimant’s  expense,  attribute  any  loss  or  damage  to  storage  at  Government  expense unless specific evidence exists of when the loss or damage occurred. 2.23.9.2.  Claimants receive an incentive payment for Personally Procured Moves (PPM).  Formerly  known  as  "do-it-yourself"  or  DITY  moves,  members  do  their  own  packing, loading, transporting, off-loading, and unpacking  of the property in  a PPM.  Settlement authorities  pay  only  for  loss  or  damage  to  property  during  a  PPM  move  resulting  from events outside claimant’s control. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 19 2.23.10.  Duty locations.  Locations where personal property is used, stored or held because of official duties are authorized places.  Recognized duty locations MAY include: 2.23.10.1.  Any place on a military installation not otherwise excluded by this instruction. 2.23.10.2.  In  any  office,  building,  recreation  area,  or  real  estate  the  Air  Force  or  any other DoD element uses or controls. 2.23.10.3.  Any  place  a  military  member  is  required  or  ordered  to  be  pursuant  to  their duties, while performing such duties. 2.23.11.  Entitlement  or Benefit  Locations.    Locations  where  property  is  used,  or  stored  for use at that location as part of an entitlement or benefit, such as the employee lockers at the commissary or member  lockers at  the  golf  course, are authorized places.  However, for the site to be an authorized place the claimant must have used it for its intended purpose and the property  located  at  the  site  must  be  reasonably  linked  to  that  use.    Claimants  should  show that precautions and security measures were taken to the extent possible to prevent incidents of loss or damage from occurring. 2.24.  Payable  Causes  of  Loss  Incident  to  Service.  Because  the  PCA  is  not  a  substitute  for insurance, settlement authorities pay for loss or damage at quarters and other authorized places, during  duty  hours  (24/7  for  active  military),  only  if  caused  by:  (1)  an  unusual  occurrence,  (2) theft,  vandalism  or  other  malfeasance,  (3)  hostile  action,  (4)  a  carrier,  contractor  or warehouseman storing or moving goods or privately owned vehicles at Government expense, (5) an agent of the US, or (6) a permanent seizure of a witness’s property by the Air Force. 2.24.1.  Unusual Occurrences.  Settlement authorities pay for loss or damage at quarters and other authorized places if caused by  an unusual  occurrence.  For  a hazard to  be an unusual occurrence  it  must  be  outside  the  normal  risks  of  day-to-day  living  and  working.    Unusual occurrences are never continuous conditions.  The CSC determines what constitutes and what qualifies as an unusual occurrence.  Examples of unusual occurrences may be: 2.24.1.1.  A suddenly occurring, substantial defect in a building. 2.24.1.2.  Violent natural events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions, that are unanticipated and over which no one has any control. 2.24.1.3.  Fires, regardless of whether the fire was caused by an Act of God or by human fault, such as faulty wiring or  arson.  Do not  pay for fire loss or damage  caused by the wrongful or negligent conduct of the claimant, their dependents, their agent, houseguest or other persons with a contractual relationship with those previously mentioned. 2.24.1.3.1.  Potential  claimants  should  maintain  their  quarters  and  supervise  small children to minimize the risk of fire.  Failure to do so is negligence. 2.24.1.3.2.  Settlement authorities are not bound by a police report or report of survey stating  that  the  claimant  was  not  negligent,  but  reach  an  independent  conclusion based on all the evidence. 2.24.1.4.  Flooding caused by weather conditions or burst pipes in quarters. 2.24.2.  An  event  of  a  common  nature  that  occurs  to  an  unexpected  degree  of  severity.  Typically, customary and reasonable precautions, based upon local conditions, have failed to protect against damages in this scenario.  Some examples include: 20 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 2.24.2.1.  Storms  of  extreme  intensity  that  causes  damage  to  an  unexpected  degree  of severity for that locale. 2.24.2.2.  Power  surges  affecting  electrical  or  electronic  devices,  when  lightning  has actually  struck  the  claimant's  residence  or  objects  outside  the  residence,  such  as  the transformer box. 2.24.2.3.  Power  surges  affecting  electrical  or  electronic  devices,  when  power  company records  or  similar  evidence  show  that  a  particular  residence  or  group  of  residences  was subjected to a power surge of unusual intensity. 2.24.2.4.  Power outages of enough length to spoil food. 2.24.2.5.  The falling of a large tree or a significant portion of one. 2.24.2.6.  Infestation by termites, other insects, or rodents, if such infestations are rare in the local area and a reasonably prudent person would not have taken preventive action. 2.24.3.  Regularly occurring events are not unusual occurrences.  Some examples include: 2.24.3.1.  Routine or regularly occurring storms. 2.24.3.2.  Ice and snow sliding off a roof onto a vehicle or object. 2.24.3.3.  Falling branches or sap settling on vehicles. 2.24.3.4.  Common,  minor  deficiencies  in  buildings  that  are  known  to  the  claimant  and cause predictable damage to personal property. 2.24.3.5.  Infestation by termites, other insects, or rodents in areas where such infestation is common, well known, and individuals can take effective precautions. 2.24.3.6.  Gradual  deterioration  of  furniture  and  other  items  due  to  climatic  conditions, such as cracking or shrinkage of wooden panels in an extremely dry area. 2.24.3.7.  Vehicle collisions, including those with deer or other animals and objects such as shopping carts. 2.24.3.8.  Structural  or  mechanical  failures  in  vehicles,  appliances,  electronics  or  any other item  caused by normal  operation or wear  and tear  and expected during the life of the item. 2.24.4.  The  following  situations  are  not  unusual  occurrences  and  should  be  investigated IAW AFI 51-501: 2.24.4.1.  Spotting, etching, discoloration, or other damage allegedly caused by airborne chemicals or other discharges from Air Force activities.  Consider the discharge to be an unusual  occurrence  only  when  investigation  reveals  that  unusual  weather  conditions caused it. 2.24.4.2.  Paint over-spray. 2.24.4.3.  Errant objects  from ball fields and golf courses (e.g., baseballs and golf balls) and rocks thrown up by lawn mowers, weed-eaters, or vehicles. 2.24.4.4.  Damage  to  moving  vehicles  caused  by  defects  or  foreign  objects  in  the roadway. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 21 2.24.5.  Theft,  Robbery,  Larceny,  Burglary,  Housebreaking,  Vandalism  and  other Malfeasance.  Settlement authorities pay for the intentional, wrongful taking of or damage to property  that  occurs  at  quarters,  or  at  other  authorized  places  during  duty  hours  (24/7  for active military members). 2.24.5.1.  A  claimant  who  fails  to  report  a  criminal  taking  of  his  or  her  property immediately, or as soon as practical, may fail to prove that a theft occurred. 2.24.5.2.  Where the perpetrator of a crime (that served as the basis of the claim) has been identified, settlement  authorities may suspend the claim  if a good chance  exists that the claimant  can  obtain  payment  for  the  loss  or  damage.    However,  if  a  responsible  party cannot pay the claim quickly and without undue burden, the claim should be adjudicated under  the  PCA.    Settlement  authorities  never  deny  a  claim  solely  because  a  perpetrator has been identified. 2.24.6.  Privately  Owned  Vehicle  (POV)  Theft  and  Vandalism.    Due  to  the  mobility  of vehicles,  settlement  authorities  require  a  higher  degree  of  evidence  than  in  other  cases  to show  that  the  damage  or  loss  actually  occurred  at  quarters  or  an  authorized  place.    Unless claimants  prove  that  such  damage  occurred  at  the  appropriate  time  and  at  an  authorized place, claims for damages to vehicles are not payable. 2.24.7.  POV Hit and Run Claims.  Generally, settlement authorities do not pay for loss of or damage to  a POV caused by  hit and  run.  Settlement authorities may  consider payment  for damage  to  a  POV  caused  by  a  hit  and  run,  only  if  the  vehicle  was  used  while  performing temporary duty away from the claimant’s home station and the use is specifically authorized on their Government orders. 2.24.7.1.  For  POV  claims  to  be  considered  meritorious  for  theft,  vandalism  or  hit  and run, claimants provide: 2.24.7.1.1.  Evidence of the location where the damage or loss was first discovered (if the  place  of  discovery  and  the  location  of  the  incident  are  not  the  same).    This evidence is verified by a police report. 2.24.7.1.2.  A statement from a witness who either saw the event or can confirm the vehicle's presence during the time period the damage occurred. 2.24.7.1.3.  Other evidence proving the location  of the vehicle when loss or damage occurred. 2.24.8.  Enemy  Action,  Hostile  Acts,  Confiscation,  Evacuation,  or  Public  Service.  Settlement authorities pay for loss or damage that results directly from: 2.24.8.1.  Enemy  action  or  threat,  including  combat,  guerrilla,  or  other  belligerent activities, whether or not the US was involved.  This includes action to prevent capture or confiscation. 2.24.8.2.  Acts of mob violence, terrorist attacks, or other hostile acts directed against the US, military members, or employees. 2.24.8.3.  Unjust confiscation of property belonging to Air Force members or employees by a foreign government or its nationals.  The term "confiscation" includes situations in 22 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 which an unjust change or application of foreign law forces surrender or abandonment of property. 2.24.8.4.  Action by the claimant in an attempt to: 2.24.8.4.1.  Stop a civil disturbance. 2.24.8.4.2.  Assist during a public disaster. 2.24.8.4.3.  Save a human life. 2.24.8.4.4.  Save Government property. 2.24.8.5.  Evacuation  from  a  foreign  country  on  the  recommendation  or  order  of competent authority, in response to an act of political unrest or a hostile act by people in that country. 2.24.9.  GBL Carriers, Contract Carrier or Storage Company.  Damage caused by carriers or storage companies storing or moving goods at Government expense are types of loss incident to  service.    Settlement  authorities  consider  property  lost  or  damaged  in  shipment  at Government  expense  to  be  lost  or  damaged  incident  to  service,  even  if  the  shipment  is overweight and the claimant pays part of the shipping costs. 2.24.10.  Loss of Money Delivered to an Agent of the US.  Settlement authorities pay for the loss  of  money  delivered  to  Government  personnel  authorized  or  apparently  authorized  to accept funds. 2.24.11.  Property  of  a  Victim  or  Witness  Held  as  Evidence.    If  authorities  hold  property belonging to the victim or witness of a crime as evidence for an extended time, and, the loss or damage of the property creates a hardship on the victim, settlement authorities may (at the request  of  the  witness  or  victim)  consider  the  property  permanently  lost,  retain  it  and  if  a properly authorized claimant, pay for the loss or damage.  Such items should be turned over to Defense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO) when no longer needed. 2.24.12.  Property  of  an  Accused.    Settlement  authorities  do  not  pay  a  person  suspected  or accused of an offense for property seized as evidence from them. 2.24.12.1.  EXCEPTION:  If competent authority find the suspect or accused not guilty of the offense for which the property was seized, then settlement authorities may pay claims for loss, damage, or destruction of that property. 2.25.  Maximum  Allowable  Payments.  Consistent  with  the  paragraph  2.38  on  quantities  and qualities  in  Section  2E,  the  military  claims  services  have  created  the  Allowance  List  - Depreciation Guide.  This guide notes the maximum amount payable under the PCA for certain items and categories of items.  These amounts are considered to generally reflect the amount of a given type of property that is reasonable or useful to possess under the circumstances.  Apply the maximum allowable payments when adjudicating personnel claims. 2.25.1.  Authority to Waive the Maximum Allowable: 2.25.1.1.  Generally, maximums exist because payment under the PCA is limited to items of  a  quantity  and  quality  that  are  reasonable  or  useful  to  the  average  person.    To  the extent a claimant owns property beyond this threshold, he or she is expected to provide private  insurance  coverage  or  accept  the  risk  of  loss.  The  Air  Force  recognizes  that  the AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 23 maximum allowable amounts may not be appropriate in all cases.  As such, the Chief or Deputy  Chief  of  the  CSC  may  waive  maximums  when  it  is  determined  to  be  an appropriate payment. 2.25.2.  Process for Waiving the Maximum Allowable: 2.25.2.1.  Claimants  are  not  required  to  request  a  waiver  of  the  maximum  allowable; consideration for waivers is automatic. 2.25.2.2.  The  claims  examiner  will  create  a  memo  for  record  (MFR)  when  a  waiver  is applied that provides the facts determining the decision to waive the maximum.  (T-3)  If the waiver is not approved up to the full-adjudicated amount of the relevant item(s), the MFR will provide the reason for this determination.  (T-3)  The MFR shall be placed into the claims file. (T-3) The waiver of a maximum allowable must be considered prior to the final settlement of the claim itself. (T-3) Section 2D— 2.26.  Time  Prescribed  for  Filing  (Statute  of  Limitations).  In  accordance  with  the  PCA, settlement  authorities  pay  no  claim  under  this  chapter  filed  after  the  two-year  statute  of limitations has expired. 2.26.1.  Authorities  may  not  waive  the  statute  of  limitations  (SOL),  even  if  the  claimant alleges or proves erroneous advice by claims personnel. 2.26.2.  Generally, the two-year period for filing a claim begins: 2.26.2.1.  At the time of the incident causing the loss or damage; or 2.26.2.2.  At the time when the claimant discovered or should reasonably have discovered the loss or damage. 2.26.3.  The two-year period for filing transportation loss or damage claims normally begins on the last date of delivery or upon notification of a total loss for a shipment. 2.26.4.  The two-year period for filing loss or damage from storage at Government expense normally begins when: 2.26.4.1.  The claimant receives notification of a total storage loss; 2.26.4.2.  The claimant is able to assess the extent of the loss or damage.  Normally, this assessment  occurs  when  a  Government  carrier  delivers  the  goods  out  of  storage.    If claimants choose to retrieve their personal property on their own, they should complete a DD  Form  1840,  Joint  Statement  of  Loss  or  Damage  at  Delivery,  prior  to  leaving  the facility with their items; 2.26.4.3.  The claimant's storage entitlement at Government expense expires and there is no further Government involvement in the shipment; or 2.26.4.4.  A Government carrier delivers the property from storage after the Government entitlement expires. 2.26.5.  In computing the two-year period, if the last day falls on a non-workday (a Saturday, Sunday,  or  legal  holiday),  claims  personnel  extend  the  two  years  to  the  next  workday  for 24 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 physical  claims  forms  mailed  through  the  US  Postal  or  military  postal  system.    For  claims filed on-line or emailed to the CSC, an extension is not warranted. 2.26.6.  The CSC determines whether any extension of SOL is warranted.  The two-year SOL may be extended if the claimant can demonstrate the following two elements: 2.26.6.1.  The two-year period began: 2.26.6.1.1.  Within two years before the US enters a war or armed conflict, OR 2.26.6.1.2.  During a war or an armed conflict involving the US; and 2.26.6.2.  Good cause for delay in filing the claim related to an armed conflict. 2.26.7.  Any extension of the SOL expires not later than two years after the earlier of: 2.26.7.1.  The end of the US participation in the war or armed conflict. 2.26.7.2.  The end of any period of captivity. 2.26.7.3.  The date the good cause for delay in filing the claim ceased to exist. 2.27.  Filing (Presenting) a Claim.  A claimant has officially filed a claim under this Instruction when it is submitted in one of the following ways: 2.27.1.  A  claim  submitted  through  the  mail  has  been  deemed  presented  when  it  has  been properly addressed and received at the CSC. 2.27.1.1.  For  purposes  of  the  PCA  only,  a  claim  submitted  in  accordance  with  the preceding paragraph is considered to have been received at CSC when postmarked by the United  States  Postal  Service.    This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  other  delivery  service (e.g. FEDEX, DHL, UPS, etc). 2.27.2.  Claimants may file a claim by facsimile (fax) or by scanning and emailing the signed DD  Form  1842,  Claim  for  Loss  or  Damage  to  Personal  Property  Incident  to  Service,  and additional  documents  to  the  CSC.    A  claimant  has  officially  presented  a  faxed  or  e-mailed claim when a facsimile machine at the CSC receives it.  Confirmation notice received by the claimant on his or her facsimile machine or e-mail does not satisfy the requirement of receipt by the CSC. 2.27.3.  An electronic claim submitted to the CSC website online is deemed presented when the claimant acknowledges the disclaimer and presses the submit button.  The DD Form 1842 is no longer required for electronically filed claims. 2.27.4.  The CSC is the military claims office (MCO) for the Air Force.  An electronic claim transferred to the Air Force from an official DoD claims website is deemed presented when the claimant has performed the tasks necessary to transfer the claim.  In the DPS, individual line items are transferred by pressing the “Transfer to MCO” button on the claims menu on each separate line item. 2.27.5.  Claimants  may  file  a  claim  by  personally  delivering  a  signed  DD  Form  1842  and additional documents to the CSC or an AF base legal office.   For those installations where there  is  no  AF  base  legal  office  (e.g.,  joint  bases  where  another  Service  has  primary responsibility the  CSC (https://claims.jag.af.mil ) or the closest servicing AF legal office. for  mission claimants support), should file  with AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 25 2.28.  Improper Filing of Claims. 2.28.1.  Receipt  by  a  National  Guard  or  Reserve  unit  or  by  a  Federal  Agency  outside  the DOD does not constitute a proper filing. Section 2E— 2.29.  Loss Generally Payable Under the PCA.  Settlement authorities only pay claims for the loss  of  or  damage  to  tangible  personal  property  owned  by  the  claimant  and  immediate  family members  residing  with  the  claimant  who  qualify  as  dependents.    Property  owned  by  claimants includes items properly leased, rented, or borrowed. 2.30.  Types  of  Property  Properly  Payable  (Tangible  Personal  Property).  The  PCA  only authorizes  payment  for  loss  of  or  damage  to  tangible  personal  property.    Payment  is  not authorized for real or intangible property. 2.30.1.  Real  Property.    Real  property  includes  land  and  whatever  is  permanently  erected, growing upon or affixed to land (fixtures).  Settlement authorities do not pay for damage to real property. 2.30.2.  Intangible Property.  Settlement  authorities do not  pay  for the loss of or damage to intangible  property,  because  individuals  who  lose  such  property  still  retain  their  property rights.  Examples include (but are not limited to): 2.30.2.1.  Non-negotiable stock certificates. 2.30.2.2.  Promissory notes. 2.30.2.3.  Bonds. 2.30.2.4.  Insurance policies. 2.30.2.5.  Bank books (Register/Ledgers). 2.30.2.6.  Bills of lading. 2.30.2.7.  Art objects, documents or other property that the claimant made or wrote. 2.30.2.7.1.  Settlement  authorities pay for the value of the materials  used in  creating such items. 2.30.2.7.2.  Settlement authorities pay for such items if the claimant can demonstrate an  independently  established  marketable  value  for  the  object  or  document.    The existence of such a market value would make the item tangible personal property. 2.30.3.  Negotiable  Instruments.    Settlement  authorities  pay  for  the  loss  of  or  damage  to  a negotiable  instrument,  such  as  a  check,  only  if  the  claimant  can  show  that  the  bank  or institution that issued the instrument cannot reissue it or otherwise provide payment. 2.31.  Repair and Replacement Expenses.  In addition to tangible personal property, settlement authorities  may  pay  for  certain  expenses  associated  with  the  repair  or  replacement  of  personal property,  including  sales  tax,  shipping  and  handling  fees,  pick-up  and  delivery  fees,  estimate fees, hazardous waste fees and appraisal fees (see paragraph 3.31). 2.32.  Fees  for  Obtaining  Certain  Documents.  Settlement  authorities  pay  fees  for  replacing official documents (originals or certified copies only) created by a third party which have a cost 26 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 associated with replacement. However, settlement authorities do not pay in advance of actually incurring the cost of replacement.  Paid receipts may be required before the claimant can be paid.  Settlement  authorities  pay  for  birth  certificates,  marriage  certificates,  college  diplomas, passports, or similar documents if lost or damaged incident to service. 2.32.1.  Pay only for replacing necessary, official documents with a raised seal. 2.32.2.  Do not pay for: 2.32.2.1.  Documents that are representative of value, such as stock certificates. 2.32.2.2.  Personal letters or records created by the claimant. 2.33.  Incidental  and  Consequential  Damages.  Award  under to compensation for actual  loss of or damage to  property.  Settlement  authorities may not  pay  for incidental expenses or consequential damages connected with the loss of or damage to personal property, including: the  PCA is limited 2.33.1.  Costs of preparing a claim. 2.33.2.  Costs associated with loss of use. 2.33.3.  Attorney’s fees. 2.33.4.  Inconvenience expenses, such as the cost of lodging or food while awaiting arrival of a shipment. 2.33.5.  Cost of transporting the member or member’s family. 2.33.6.  Telephone calls. 2.33.7.  Financial losses due to canceled orders. 2.33.8.  Cost incurred due to canceled leave. 2.33.9.  A claimant's own labor charges. 2.34.  Normal  Wear  and  Tear.  Claims  personnel  do  not  pay  for  normal  wear  and  tear  to personal property.  Normal wear and tear is any damage to property that is reasonably expected from the normal use of the property.  This includes mechanical failure or other damage to parts that  are  designed  to  be  replaced  during  the  life  of  the  property.    For  example,  minor  dents  or chips  caused  by  driving  a  vehicle  or  minor  scratches  on  furniture  are  normal  wear  and  tear.  Similarly,  wearing  out  of  a  vehicle  clutch,  brakes  or  other  mechanical  device  is  also  normal wear. Section 2F— 2.35.  The Reasonable or Useful Requirement.  The PCA states that settlement authorities may pay  a  claim  only  when  the  claimant's  possession  of  the  property  claimed  was  reasonable  or useful under the circumstances. 2.36.  Determining  Reasonable  or  Useful.  While some property is never reasonable or useful to  possess,  most  reasonable/useful  determinations  will  be  based  upon  the  circumstances surrounding  possession.    Claims  personnel  should  use  their  experiences  and  those  of  others, insight and common sense to determine if a reasonable person would possess a particular item at AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 27 a  given  place  or  time.    For  example,  some  items  that  are  perfectly  reasonable  to  possess  in quarters serve no useful purpose in the field or on temporary duty (TDY) travel. 2.36.1.  In  general,  the  workplace  is  not  a  proper  place  for  storing  personal  property  other than tools and equipment.  Items such as televisions are not considered reasonable or useful.  However,  coffeepots,  radios,  microwave  ovens,  decorative  items  such  as  pictures  or  plants, and  items  such  as  professional  books,  are  normally  reasonable  and  useful  to  keep  at  the workplace. 2.36.2.  As a general rule, $200 cash on the person and $300 cash in quarters is the maximum reasonable amount to possess.  However, if the claimant has a valid and substantiated reason for possessing more than that amount, it could be considered reasonable for purposes of this AFI.  No amount of money is considered reasonable for shipment or storage. 2.36.3.  The only items deemed appropriate to ship with a vehicle or store in a parked vehicle are  child  car  seats,  tools  for  emergency  road  repairs,  spare  tires,  snow  or  mud  tires,  the catalytic  converter  and  components,  and  small  comfort  items  like  thermos  bottles  or  car cushions.    For  campers  or  other  recreational  vehicles,  at  an  authorized  location,  items normally  used  for  such  activity  such  as;  sleeping  bags,  lanterns,  outdoor  paddles,  oars,  and utensils, may be stored in the vehicle and considered reasonable and useful. 2.37.  Personal  Items,  Tools,  and  Other  Equipment  Used to  Perform  Official Duties.  Personal  items,  tools  and  other  equipment  are  generally  not  useful  or  reasonable  to possess  in  the  work  place  during  duty  hours.    Normally,  Air  Force  personnel  do  not  have  a reasonable  need  to  use  their  personal  items  for  official  duties.    For  example,  privately  owned personal computers are generally inappropriate for use in performing official duties. 2.37.1.  Settlement authorities may pay for loss of or damage to personal tools and equipment only  if  the  claimant  used  them  to  perform  assigned  tasks  on  a  temporary  basis  with  the expressed authorization of a supervisor or commander, or the use was so brief or limited that it would not be reasonable to expect authorization. 2.37.2.  Settlement authorities may pay for useful personal items such as diplomas, pictures, and books that one would expect to find in the workplace setting, as long as the quantity and value of the items possessed was reasonable. 2.38.  Quantities and Qualities  of Property.  The quantity and quality of items should also be looked at in order to determine whether property loss or damage was reasonable or useful under the law. 2.38.1.  Settlement authorities should consider whether quantities of property far in excess of what a claimant can use under the circumstances violate the reasonable or useful rule. 2.38.2.  Settlement  authorities  should  consider  the  quality  of  property  (both  exceptionally high and low) in their reasonable/useful evaluation.  Items that were old or broken and had no value or could not be used for their intended purpose prior to the loss or damage are by definition not useful under the law.  Items of exceptionally high value, such that they require special  handling,  protection  and  security  may  not  be  reasonable  for  the  average  person  to possess under the PCA. 28 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 2.39.  Items Stored in Lockers.  As a general rule, it is reasonable to store up to $250 worth of property,  to  include  $100  cash,  in  a  locker.    Settlement  authorities  may  pay  more  than  $250  if justification exists. 2.40.  Property Never Deemed Reasonable or Useful. 2.40.1.  Because the Air Force does not consider business property to be reasonable or useful for  military  service  or  employment,  settlement  authorities  do  not  pay  for  property  that claimants acquire and keep for resale, or for use in a private business or enterprise. 2.40.1.1.  Settlement  authorities  pay  for  items  that  claimants  acquire  for  both  personal and  business  use,  only  if  the  business  use  is  incidental  and  the  item  is  of  the  type commonly owned for personal use.  However, settlement authorities never pay for items lost or damaged while the claimant is using them for business. 2.40.1.2.  Settlement authorities do not pay for an item occasionally used for business if the item is designed for professional use and is not normally intended for personal use. 2.40.2.  Settlement  authorities  do  not  pay  for  contraband  and  other  items  that  claimants illegally acquire, possess, or transport. 2.40.3.  Settlement authorities do not pay for loss or damage when the owner fails to properly register  or  insure  property,  such  as  a  vehicle,  in  compliance  with  a  contract,  state  law,  Air Force Instruction, or installation requirements. 2.40.4.  Settlement authorities do not pay for items whose only purpose is to violate the law, such as radar detectors. 2.40.5.  Settlement authorities do not pay for money (other than coin or currency collections), expensive  jewelry  (i.e.  more  than  $1000)  or  other  items  highly  subject  to  pilferage  that  are lost  in  shipment  or  storage  at  Government  expense.    CSC  recommends  that  those  items  be separately  insured  and  securely  transported  or  hand  carried.    Carriers,  contractors,  or warehousemen  may  still  be  liable  for  such  losses,  especially  if  those  items  are  listed  on  a high risk/high value inventory. 2.40.6.  Settlement authorities do not pay claims for enemy property or war trophies procured by the claimant. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 29 Chapter 3 ADMINISTERING, PROCESSING, AJUDICATING AND PAYING PERSONNEL CLAIMS Section 3A— 3.1.  Publicity.  The CSC has overall responsibility to  provide  guidance and updates for claims covered  by  this  Instruction.    They  may  however,  request  installation  legal  office  assistance  in publicizing specific information. 3.2.  Base Emergency Support and Disaster Relief.  Base legal office personnel are the critical first  responders  to  any  event  with  significant  impact  on  claims,  to  include  any  major  incident, natural  disaster,  or  an  event  deemed  an  “unusual  occurrence”  under  the  PCA  (see  paragraph 2.24.1).    The  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA)  will  ensure  the  base  leadership  is  aware  of  this responsibility.    (T-1)    The  base  legal  office  will  educate  the  base  population  on  the  claims process and claims issues that may arise as a result of a major incident or natural disaster. (T-3) 3.2.1.  Legal  offices  at  active  duty  installations  may  utilize  the  following  forums  to  present and  address  key  claims  issues  to  the  base  population:    speaking  at  newcomer’s  orientation and  commanders’  calls,  publishing  articles  in  the  local  newspapers,  and  coordinating  with Family  Services  and  Traffic  Management  Offices  (TMO)  concerning  the  “Smooth  Move” Program. 3.2.2.  Base  legal  offices  will  brief,  as  appropriate,  the  base  community  on  the  availability and  circumstances  under  which  partial  and  emergency  partial  payments  can  be  made  (see paragraph 3.8). (T-3) 3.2.3.  Should an event happen on an installation that could lead to a large volume of claims being filed against the AF, the SJA will make the initial report of the event to the CSC using the quickest means possible.  (T-3)  Once such a report is made, the SJA will provide updates as appropriate. (T-3)   If the initial report was not made in writing, a follow-up written report should be submitted as soon as practical. Examples of significant claims events may include but are not limited to: 3.2.3.1.  Natural  disasters,  such  as  severe  weather,  floods,  and  fires,  or  any  other  major incidents  involving  wide-scale  loss  of  or  damage  to  personal  property  and/or  requiring expert advice, assistance, or numerous emergency partial payments. 3.2.3.2.  Incidents and investigations (UCMJ, DoD, or other) of fraud, waste or abuse in claims covered under this Instruction. 3.2.3.3.  Incidents involving claims that may receive widespread media coverage. 3.2.4.  At a minimum the SJA should include the following in the written report: 3.2.4.1.  The  type  of  incident/disaster  to  include  the  date  and  time  (if  known)  and  the  cause (if applicable) of the event. 3.2.4.2.  Information on whether or not the base claims response team was activated, and if activated, an estimated or actual time the team arrived to the scene. 3.2.4.3.  The number of deceased or injured (if applicable). 30 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 3.2.4.4.  The  extent  of  property  damage  with  an  estimate  of  the  number  of  potential claims and the dollar amount of damage. 3.2.4.5.  The need for emergency or partial payments. 3.2.4.6.  The status of cash funds available at the installation for immediate payment. 3.2.4.7.  Potential or actual need for additional claims personnel, equipment, or expertise. 3.2.4.8.  Any other pertinent information. 3.2.5.  Base legal  office  personnel  should visit the incident/disaster site, if possible, and get first-hand  view  and  understanding  of  the  devastation.    The  CSC  and/or  AFLOA/JACC should be notified of revised estimates as quickly as possible. 3.3.  Responding  to  Events  with  Significant  Claims  Impact.  The SJA will ensure base legal personnel  are properly trained, equipped, and prepared to  set  up  claims operations and provide claims  support  in  response  to  such  events.    (T-3)    Where  circumstances  prevent  the  base  legal office  at  the  affected  installation  from  responding,  the  legal  office  closest  to  the  affected installation will take on the role of critical first responders.  (T-3)  Upon request by the SJA of the affected installation, through the appropriate chain of command, AFLOA/JACC may provide equipment and/or personnel to assist and augment the base legal office’s claims mission. 3.4.  Field  Augmentation  Support  Team.  The  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC  or  their  designee  will train  and  equip  a  Field  Augmentation  Support  Team  (FAST)  to  provide  rapid  contingency response  by  supplementing,  substituting,  or  otherwise  assisting  local  installation  claims  teams with expertise and on-site claims processing as needed.  (T-2)  The FAST will consist of trained and experienced AFLOA/JACC personnel or other qualified, designated individuals. 3.5.  Requesting  FAST  Support.  The  SJA  of  any  installation,  NAF,  DRU,  or  MAJCOM affected  by  a  major  incident,  natural  disaster,  or  “unusual  occurrence”  that  may  require augmentation by the FAST should request assistance in the following manner:  The commander of the affected installation’s owning MAJCOM requests assistance through the Air Force Crisis Action Team  (CAT).  The CAT should inform  AF/JA of the request.   The request  should then flow from AF/JA to AFLOA/CC to JACC, who should in turn mobilize the FAST.  To the extent practicable, the SJA should provide AFLOA/JACC with a general assessment of the incident or disaster, the organic assets available to the SJA to provide claims services, the specific nature of the augmentation required, and any other relevant details. 3.5.1.  Based  on  the  severity  of  the  emergent  circumstances  and  the  volume  of  anticipated claims, the Chief, AFLOA/JACC may place the FAST on standby, immediately dispatch the FAST,  or  maintain  the  status  quo,  notifying  the  requestor  and  the  requester’s  MAJCOM accordingly. 3.5.2.  The  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC  will  notify  the  Director,  AFLOA/JAC,  AFLOA/CC,  and TJAG of any decision on requests for FAST support or a decision to mobilize the FAST by providing  the  relevant  details,  including  the  particulars  of  the  request,  the  degree  of anticipated damage, the volume of claims anticipated, and the size, scope, and duration of the FAST's on-scene response (if any).  (T-2) 3.6.  Assisting Claimants.  Both the CSC and the active installation legal offices are responsible for assisting claimants as to their respective functions.  (T-2)   The underlying goal should be to restore claimants to the condition they were in prior to their loss to the extent permitted by the AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 31 PCA or other applicable claims statute.  To assist the active installation legal offices, the Claims Service Center Handbook is available on the CSC website.  In addition, CSC provides training to installation legal offices on a periodic basis. 3.6.1.  General Guidance. The CSC assists claimants by telephone with highly-trained claims personnel and by maintaining an up-to-date website detailing the claims process.  Telephone calls from claimants to CSC shall be answered promptly and courteously.  (T-3)  In addition, all  claims  personnel  should  advise  claimants  to  accurately  describe  the  facts  and circumstances giving rise to the claim and assist them through the process of filing a claim on-line.    The  on-line  claims  program  allows  CSC  personnel  to  view  the  claimant’s  claims application  so  claims  personnel  can  address  any  issues  the  claimants  are  experiencing  with their on-line claims application. 3.6.2.  Guidance for PCA Claims Arising Out of Government Sponsored Transportation. 3.6.2.1.  Timely  Notice  to  TSP,  Contractor  ,  or  Warehouseman  of  Loss  or  Damage.  Active  duty  installation  legal  offices  and  CSC  Personnel  shall  inform  all  potential claimants of the obligation to properly notify the carrier, contractor, or warehouseman of Government sponsored transportation.  (T-1)  Potential claimants should be informed that a failure to properly and timely give notice may result in a reduction or forfeiture of any potential award under the PCA.  Under Full Replacement Value (FRV) contracts, a TSP has no obligation to pay claims for which there is no timely notice. 3.6.2.1.1.  Household Goods (HHG) Claims.  Claimants and delivery personnel may identify losses or damages during the delivery process.  No specific format is required but the TSP may provide their own form or use a DD Form 1840, Statement of Loss or Damage at Delivery.  Claimants  also notify the TSP of damages or losses that are identified after their household goods have been delivered.  Claimants have 75 days after delivery to make this notification.  If the shipment was processed in the Defense Personal  Property  System  (DPS),  the  notification  should  be  made  online  through DPS.    Otherwise,  this  notification  has  no  specific  format  but  the  TSP  may  provide their  own  form  or  use  a  DD  Form  1840R,  Notice  of  Loss  or  Damage.    These  DD forms are commonly referred to as the “pink forms.” 3.6.2.1.2.  How  the  Notice  Works.    Damage  or  loss  discovered  during  the  delivery process should be noted at the time delivery is completed.  Regardless of format, the TSP retains a copy and provides a copy of the completed notation to the member at that  time.    For  all  later  discovered  losses  or  damages,  claimants  notify  the  TSP  in DPS  online  within  75  days  of  the  completed  delivery.    If  the  notification  is  made outside  of  DPS  (through  a  form  provided  by  the  TSP,  on  a  DD  Form  1840R,  or otherwise),  the  claimant  ensures  the  TSP  receives  the  notification  within  75  days.  The  installation  legal  office  can  transmit  (dispatch)  the  notification  to  the  TSP.  However, to ensure delivery to the TSP within 75 days, claimants should provide the notification to the installation legal office within 70 days after delivery. 3.6.2.2.  Completing the Notification of Loss or Damage. 3.6.2.2.1.  There is a comprehensive checklist for the Notification of Loss or Damage on the CSC website.  Active duty installation legal  office personnel  assist  claimants by  accepting  and  verifying  that  information  on  any  notification  of  loss  or  damage 32 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 after delivery contains the information required for a complete DD Form 1840R prior to dispatching it to the TSP and scanning and uploading a copy to the CSC website.  (T-1)    A  brief  description  of  how  to  complete  the  1840R  follows.    This  is  no substitute  for  the  comprehensive  checklist  on  the  CSC  website,  which  may  be updated based on changing regulatory conditions. 3.6.2.2.2.  Claimants  are  responsible  for  completing  Sections  1  and  2  of  the  form.  When  filling  out  Section  2,  claimants  need  only  provide  enough  information  to  put the TSP on notice regarding the general type of loss or damage.  However, claimants should  list  as  much  specific  or  obvious  loss  or  damage  as  possible.    Each  item identified as either missing or damaged is required to include an inventory number. 3.6.2.2.3.  Active duty installation legal office personnel complete Sections 3 and 4 of the form and ensure all pages are numbered.  Include someplace visible on the form:  (T-1) 3.6.2.2.3.1.  An  estimate  of  the  total  amount  of  loss  or  damage  for  the  entire shipment.  Use the following language: “I estimate my total loss or damage to be $_______.”  (T-1) 3.6.2.2.3.2.  A  request  for  copies  of  any  repair  estimates  or  inspection  reports prepared by the TSP, contractor, or warehouseman or their agent.  (T-1) 3.6.2.2.3.3.  Request  for  the  TSP  to  send  any  inspections  or  tracer  actions  to  the Air Force Claims Service Center.  (T-1) 3.6.2.3.  Dispatching  Forms.    Active  installation  legal  office  personnel  must  review  all forms presented and dispatch them to the appropriate TSP, contractor, or warehouseman within 75 days of delivery.  (T-1)  The date of dispatch must be noted on the form.(T-1)  This “dispatch date” must be the date the form was actually sent.  (T-1)  Any DD Form 1840R  received  between  70  and  75  days  from  the  date  of  delivery  of  claimant’s  HHGs shall be both mailed and faxed to the TSP.  (T-1)  The address to which the notice is sent depends upon the type of HHG shipment. 3.6.2.3.1.  Direct  Procurement  Method  (DPM)  HHG  Shipments.    Send  notice  to  the name and address noted in block 15c of DD Form 1840. 3.6.2.3.2.  All other types of HHG Shipments.  Send notice to the name and address noted in block 9 of DD Form 1840. 3.6.2.3.3.  Contact  the  Air  Force  Claims  Service  Center  for  guidance  if  the information is missing. 3.6.2.4.  Dispatching Forms received after 75 days.  Claims personnel shall dispatch the DD  Form  1840R  to  the  TSP,  contractor,  or  warehouseman  even  if  the  form  is  received after  the  75th  day.    (T-1)    This  is  done  because  the  notification  time  period  may  be extended  for  good  cause.    Evidence  of  good  cause  should  be  provided  by  the  claimant and dispatched with the DD Form 1840R or soon as possible after dispatch.  Good cause includes, but is not limited to, hospitalization or TDY. 3.6.2.5.  CSC personnel shall advise claimants not to throw items away before the claim is  settled  or  before  the  inspection  or  salvage  period  ends  for  any  TSP  involved.    (T-1) AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 33 However,  claims  personnel  may  advise  claimants  to  dispose  of  hazardous  or  unsafe items. 3.6.2.6.  CSC  personnel  shall  advise  claimants  that  any  involved  TSP  has  the  right  to inspect  damaged  items.    (T-1)  Claimants  who  refuse  this  right  may  forfeit  a  portion  of any award available to them under the PCA or through FRV. 3.6.3.  Claims  processed  under  the  PCA  are  normally  filed  on-line  by  the  claimant  at https://claims.jag.af.mil.    The  site  requires  claimants  to  first  either  log-in  with  their Common Access Card (CAC) from a government computer or the claimant can call the CSC to  receive  their  username  and  password  that  allows  them  to  file  from  home  or  any  other computer.    If an individual does not have access to a government computer, they may call the CSC for a user ID and password. 3.6.3.1.  The active duty installation legal office will provide claimants who are unable or unwilling to file their claim on-line with a hard-copy claims package for the type of claim they will be filing.  (T-1)  The active duty installation legal office personnel can find the necessary  forms  at  the  CSC  website.  These  forms  can  be  mailed  or  faxed  to  the  CSC either by the claimant or by the legal office through official mail. 3.6.4.  Inspections  Requested  by  the  CSC.    Active  duty  installation  legal  office  personnel may assist claimants by performing timely inspections of claimed items as requested by the CSC  when  it  determines  that  an  inspection  is  necessary  to  the  proper  adjudication  of  the claim.  (T-3) 3.7.  Prohibited Assistance.  While claims personnel provide telephone assistance to claimants, they  should  remember  that  they  represent  the  US  Air  Force  and  not  the  claimant.    Claims personnel may not: 3.7.1.  Provide legal advice or produce evidence to support the claim. 3.7.2.  Receive any gift, financial reward, share, or interest from any claim other than his or her own personal claim. 3.7.3.  Prejudge a claim.  Before the settlement authority acts, claims personnel do not: 3.7.3.1.  Give any opinion to the claimant about approval or disapproval of the claim. 3.7.3.2.  Reveal recommendations that claims personnel make to settlement authorities. 3.8.  Partial  Payments.  The  CSC  may  authorize  SJAs  at  active  duty  installations  to  make partial  payments  or  emergency  partial  payments.    Active  installation  legal  office  personnel coordinate  with  the  local  Accounting  and  Finance  office  (AFO)  and  have  a  current  fund  cite authorization  letter,  a  copy  of  which  is  available  on  the  CSC  website,  to  allow  settlement authorities to make an emergency partial payment of $2,000 or less to a claimant.  (T-2)  These claims are expedited to alleviate a claimant’s hardship. 3.8.1.  Only claimants suffering a hardship because of loss or damage payable under the PCA may request such payment.  The SJA of the local active duty installation shall determine (in writing) the existence of a hardship.  (T-2)  Active installation legal offices may issue more than one partial payment to a claimant, if individual circumstances warrant.  The combined value of all partial payments in a claim shall not exceed $2,000. 3.8.2.  To receive a partial payment, the claimants: 34 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 3.8.2.1.  Demonstrate that a hardship exists. 3.8.2.2.  File a claim for at least the amount of the partial payment.  List enough lost or damaged  items  to  support  and  justify  the  full  partial  payment.    Claims  personnel  may suggest that the claimant list a few high-value items to cover the partial payment amount, rather  than  providing  a  lengthy  list  of  small  items.    The  claimant  may  later  amend  the claim for the full extent of the loss or damage.  Failure to provide required evidence may result in recoupment action by the Government. 3.8.2.3.  File  with  their  insurance  company  if  they  have  a  private  insurance  policy  that may cover all or part of their loss.  If claimants are filing for partial payment while they await insurance company response, a final accounting of payments made by the insurance company  for  the  loss  may  be  necessary.    Claimants  may  be  required  to  reimburse  the Government for any payments made that are later covered by the insurance company. 3.9.  Private  Insurance  Coverage.  Claimants  have  a  personal  responsibility  to  protect themselves from loss or damage to personal property.  This includes purchasing insurance from a private insurance company that would protect them from loss involving vehicle damage while it is located on a federal facility. 3.9.1.  Personnel  Claims  with  Insurance.    Once  an  incident  occurs,  e.g.,  vandalism  to  their vehicle  or  theft  at  home,  the  claimant  first  files  the  claim  with  the  claimant’s  insurance provider and, once the claim is settled, the claimant may file with the CSC for any amount left  unpaid.    This  may  or  may  not  include  a  deductible.    The  claimant  may  choose  not  to purchase private insurance, in which case the amount of their total potential recovery may be significantly impacted. 3.9.2.  HHG  and  GPOV  Claims.    Generally,  claimants  filing  for  loss  of  or  damage  to property from movement or storage at Government expense are not  required to file a claim under  a  private  insurance  policy  (personally  procured  moves  such  as  DITY  or  PPM  moves are  an  exception).    Claims  personnel  notify  claimants  of  their  obligation  to  inform  the  Air Force of any recovery obtained from another source. Section 3B— 3.10.  Publicity.  The CSC has the overarching responsibility to publicize the Personnel Claims Program  to  Air  Force  personnel.      The  CSC  will  do  this  by  ensuring  its  public  and  internal websites  remain  current,  distributing  information  (such  as  newspaper  articles)  Air  Force  wide, and  by  working  with  Base  Legal  Offices  to  disseminate  claims  information  tailored  to  base personnel.   (T-3) 3.11.  Claims from CSC Personnel. 3.11.1.  Claims from CSC personnel. 3.11.1.1.  These  claims  are  assigned  to  ensure  that  no  one  adjudicating  or  settling  the claim  is  rated  by  or  in  the  same  flight  as  the  claimant.    The  assigned  examiners  should assemble the file, conduct investigations and inspections as needed, adjudicate the claim, and send the claim to the Chief, AFLOA/JACC, for approval. 3.11.1.2.  Claimants may not initiate contact with the individual or individuals processing their claims to discuss the merits of their claims.  CSC personnel may contact claimants AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 35 to  request  additional  information  needed  to  adjudicate  the  claim  and  to  discuss administrative matters. 3.11.1.3.  CSC  personnel  have  60  days  from  the  date  of  settlement  to  file  for reconsideration  with  the  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC.    If  full  relief  is  not  granted,  the  file  is forwarded  to  the  Director,  Civil  Law  and  Litigation  Division  (AFLOA/JAC)  for  final settlement on the reconsideration request. 3.11.2.  Claims  by  the  Judge  Advocate  General,  the  Deputy  Judge  Advocate  General, AFLOA/CC, Director, AFLOA/JAC, and Chief, AFLOA/JACC. 3.11.2.1.  Per reciprocal agreement with sister-service military claims office, claims filed by  the  Judge  Advocate  General,  the  Deputy  Judge  Advocate  General,  AFLOA/CC, Director, AFLOA/JAC, and Chief, AFLOA/JACC are adjudicated by the sister-service in accordance with the PCA.  CSC personnel will process the payment voucher for payment from Air Force claims funds.  (T-0) 3.12.  Records  Managers  and  Custodians.  The  Chief,  CSC,  designates  CSC  personnel  to perform  the  duties  of  Functional  Area  Records  Managers  and  Records  Custodians  within  a Flight,  as  necessary,  in  accordance  with  the  records  disposition  schedules  in  the  Air  Force Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS)  on  all  claims  under  this  instruction  for which the CSC is responsible.  (T-3) 3.12.1.  Claims files contain sensitive personal information and are marked “For Official Use Only”  (FOUO).    (T-0)    Information  contained  in  these  files  may  be  exempt  from  release under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA).  in  accordance  with  DoD  5200.01-V2, Information  Security  Program,  AFI  33-332,  The  Air  Force  Privacy  and  Civil  Liberties Program,  and  AFMAN  33-363,  Management  of  Records.    Refer  to  DoD  5200.01-V2  for specific information on proper FOUO marking requirements. 3.12.2.  Sensitive  information  includes  medical  and  financial  information,  social  security numbers,  or  other  personal  information  that,  if  accessed  by  unauthorized  personnel  or released to  the public, would  reasonably be  expected to  cause  an individual harm or public embarrassment.    Sensitive  information  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  an  individual's  home address,  phone number,  social security number, dependent  identification, date of birth, race or marital status.  Sensitive personal information can include photographs. 3.13.  Records Databases.  Personnel in each flight should manage information from the Armed Forces  Claims  Information  Management  System  (AFCIMS),  and  any  computerized  database utilized in filing electronic claims. 3.14.  Disclosing  Information  and  Releasing  Records.  CSC  personnel  who  receive  requests for the release of any records, whether it is a request for a person’s own records or the records of a third party, ensure the requests are processed according to current regulatory guidance.   (T-0) The  CSC  processes  such  requests  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  DoD  Regulation 5400.7-R/Air  Force  Supplement,  DoD  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  Program,  and  AFI 33-332, The Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program.  Note that there are strict processing time standards for these requests and only the designated approval or disapproval authorities can take action on these requests. 36 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 3.14.1.  Generally, a request by a claimant for a document he or she originally submitted to the CSC may be released to the claimant. 3.14.2.  Requests by individuals for files pertaining to a third party or  requests by claimants for  their  entire  claims  file  or  documents  not  originally  submitted  are  carefully  reviewed  to ensure they are properly releasable under FOIA and the Privacy Act. 3.14.3.  Do  not  release  any  documents  that  are  attorney  work  product,  deliberative documents, or fall under any other category exempt from release. 3.15.  Reporting Unauthorized Releases.  Claims personnel immediately report any incident of unauthorized release or  possession  of any part of an Air  Force claims file to  the CSC Chief or Attorney-Advisor.  (T-1) 3.16.  Inspections.  Claims  personnel  should  request  an  inspection  be  performed  by  the installation  legal  office  nearest  to  where  the  claimed  items  are  kept  as  soon  as  possible  after receiving and reviewing the claim  and making the determination that an inspection is  required.  If a TSP has contracted with a repair firm to perform an onsite inspection, claims personnel use that estimate in determining payment on the claim.  If the claimant has obtained his or her own estimate  and  the  total  overall  amount  is  less  than  the  TSP’s  representative  repair  estimate,  the claimant’s  estimate  of  repair  is  used  in  determining  payment.    Payment  is  made  from  one estimate only. 3.17.  Managing  Claims  Funds.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Chief,  CSC,  (delegable  to  the Deputy  Chief)  to  manage,  track,  and  account  for  and  reconcile  monthly  the  funds  expended under  the  authority  of  the  PCA.    (T-2)    The  CSC  also  requests  additional  funds  from  higher headquarters as required to sustain uninterrupted operations. The CSC will keep local records of all awards, collections, and deductions made under the PCA.  (T-1) 3.17.1.  The  CSC  also  makes  payment  on  all  other  claims  vouchers  that  are  paid  from “claims funds.”  The CSC has procedures for Air Force functions to forward claims vouchers electronically to the CSC for processing. Section 3C— 3.18.  Taking in a Claim.  Claims personnel accept any claim that is presented in writing for a sum certain.  This is true even if the claim is incomplete or lacks proper substantiation.  Claims may be received by the CSC via fax, E-mail, on the website, and paper copies that are mailed to the center. 3.18.1.  For claims received without sufficient substantiation or information, CSC personnel advise the claimant in writing, preferably by e-mail, that without additional supporting proof the claim may be denied in whole or in part.  The correspondence should: 3.18.1.1.  Identify the information or evidence required to properly adjudicate the claim. 3.18.1.2.  Give  the  claimant  a  reasonable  time  limit  (specify  a  date)  for  providing  the needed  information.    Generally,  allow  no  more  than  30  days  unless  circumstances warrant a greater time frame.  Advise that settlement authorities may adjudicate the claim without  the  information  if  it  is  not  received  by  the  specified  date.    After  adjudication close the claim in AFCIMS. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 37 3.18.2.  Appropriately  track  and  document  when  all  forms,  documents,  or  other  evidence submitted by the claimant were received via any means other than on the web. 3.18.2.1.  Mark or stamp the document or form with the actual date and time received. 3.18.2.2.  Identify the office and individual who received the document or form. 3.18.3.  Convert  Foreign  Currency.    When  claims  are  received  from  members  stationed outside  the  US,  there  may  be  estimates  of  repair  or  purchase  receipts  provided  that  are  in foreign currency.  Claims personnel convert the dollar amounts from foreign to US currency using  conversion  rates  provided  in  online  trading  tools,  such  as  www.oanda.com  and www.xe.com, on the date the claim is approved for payment. 3.18.3.1.  Claims  personnel  may  adjust  any  award  if,  because  of  a  significant  change  in the  exchange  rate,  it  appears  that:  (1)  the  claimant  would  receive  a  windfall,  or  (2)  the claimant  would  suffer  an  economic  loss.    Any  such  adjustment  is  to  be  recorded  on  a memorandum for the record. 3.18.4.  Translated Documents.  Prior to adjudicating a claim, have all documents written in a foreign  language  translated.  Translate  estimates  of  repair,  receipts,  and  similar  items necessary for payments, verbatim. 3.19.  Splitting  a  Claim.  A  claim  includes  all  damages  that  a  claimant  sustains  because  of  an accident  or  incident.    Even  if  local  law  or  procedure  permits  filing  a  separate  or  split  claim, settlement  authorities  do  not  settle  or  pay  a  separate  or  split  claim  without  AFLOA/JACC advance approval. 3.20.  Required  Documents.  Claims  personnel  must  ensure  that  claimants  have  provided sufficient documentation to prove: (1) the loss or damage is properly payable under the PCA as discussed in Chapter 2; (2) they own the property claimed; (3) the property was lost or damaged; and (4) the value of the loss or damage.  (T-0) 3.20.1.  Properly Payable under the PCA.  Claimants provide evidence that a claim is payable under  the  PCA.    Consistent  with  this  Instruction,  claimants  show  that  they  were  a  proper claimant,  suffered  an  appropriate  loss,  that  the  loss  was  to  property  that  was  reasonable  or useful  to  possess,  that  they  were  not  negligent,  and  that  the  loss  was  incident  to  service.  Demonstrating that loss is incident to service is of prime importance. 3.20.1.1.  HHG  and  Global  POV  Contract  (GPOV).    Loss  of  or  damage  to  property shipped  or  stored  at  Government  expense  is  a  loss  incident  to  service.    Thus,  claims personnel ensure that claimants clearly prove items claimed were properly tendered to a TSP, contractor, or warehouseman. 3.20.1.2.  POV Claims.  The Notice of Loss or Damage to a POV, Vehicle Inspection and Shipping  Form  (VISF)  or  DD  Form  788,  Private  Vehicle  Shipping  Document  for Automobile,  is  generally  used  to  give  notice  of  loss  or  damage  to  the  carrier  and  the primary form to notify the GPOV contractor of loss or damage to vehicles.  The form is used in two ways: 3.20.1.2.1.  To show the condition of the vehicle when tendered.  Claimants should be clearly  informed  of  the  importance  of  this  step  before  they  ship  a  vehicle.    Any damage  noted  on  this  form  at  the  time  the  vehicle  is  tendered  will  be  presumed 38 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 accurate.    Claimants  should  not  agree  to  any  damage  noted  if  they  believe  the notation is incorrect, exaggerated, or misplaced. 3.20.1.2.2.  To show the  condition  of the vehicle  at  the time of delivery.    Claimants should be asked to inspect the vehicle and note any new damage.  Claimants should carefully inspect their vehicle and note all new damage on the form before leaving the Vehicle  Processing  Center  (VPC).    Claimants  should  receive  instruction  on  this process before their vehicle is picked up. 3.20.1.3.  If  a  claimant  discovers  damage  after  he  or  she  leaves  the  port,  the  claimant should  take  steps  to  document  the  loss  or  damage  as  soon  as  possible.    Any  damages discovered  after  the  claimant  has  departed  the  VPC  with  his/her  vehicle  should  be reported  to  the  VPC  as  soon  as  noticed.    The  claimant  should  provide  a  statement explaining why the damages were not initially noticed and timely reported on the VISF or DD Form 788 when the vehicle was picked up. 3.20.2.  Ownership of Property.  Claimants must submit proof that they owned or possessed the item(s) claimed.  When a claim is made for unusually expensive items or a large quantity of items, a greater amount of proof will be required.  Claims personnel must determine when a claimant has provided evidence sufficient to substantiate the claimant’s loss, as well as the value and weight of such evidence.  (T-2)  Proof that a claimant owned an item in the past does  not  necessarily  mean  it  was  owned  at  the  time  of  the  loss.    Claims  personnel  must consider the age of the evidence when weighing its value.  (T-2) 3.20.3.  Property  Lost  or  Damaged.    Claimants  must  demonstrate  they  suffered  loss  of  or damage to personal property.  Loss may be shown by proving ownership of an item no longer possessed.    Proving  damage  is  generally  accomplished  by  showing  the  condition  of  the property before the incident causing damage and its condition after.  Such proof can include: purchase  receipts,  credit  card  bills,  cancelled  checks,  and  appraisals;  photographs  or  video footage  of  the  item  with  descriptive  statement;  written  title  to  property;  insurance  policies that specifically list an item; HHG inventory sheets or VISF; and witness statements stating personal knowledge of ownership 3.20.4.  Value  of  Loss  or  Damage.    Claimants  must  prove  the  value  of  the  loss  or  damage they  have  suffered.    (T-0)    There  are  three  general  measures  of  damage:  fair  market  value, repair cost, and compensation in lieu of repair (see Section D of this Chapter).  In each case, the claimant must provide proof of the relevant measure of damage.  Such proof can include the same or similar item from catalog, web site, local merchant, or Base Exchange. 3.20.5.  Repair  Estimates.    Claims  personnel  must  ensure  that  repairs  recommended  on  an estimate are necessary to fix the transit related damages.  (T-3)  Repairs should generally be limited  to  the  most  economical  option.  Repair  estimates  must  be  by  a  qualified,  reputable firm who is willing and able to repair an item for a specific price. 3.20.5.1.  To serve as proof of internal or concealed damage, estimates should contain a repair firm’s professional opinion that a normal sturdy internal component was damaged and the cause of the damage. 3.20.5.2.  To  serve  as  proof  that  an  item  is  not  economically  repairable  or  cannot  be repaired, repair estimates should clearly state either the unreasonable cost of the repair or why the item cannot be fixed. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 39 3.20.5.3.  Estimates presented by claimants that are unreasonably high or do not meet the standards  above  are  not  valid  evidence.    Claims  personnel  may  require  claimants  to obtain additional estimates. 3.21.  Fraudulent Claims.  When claimants seek payment for loss or damage, they must submit accurate and truthful documentation to support their claim. 3.21.1.  When  settlement  authorities  determine  that  a  claimant  has  committed  fraud,  the claim  may  be  denied  in  total.    If  the  claimant  is  a  military  member,  the  claim  will  be evaluated for referral to the local installation legal office or Office of Special Investigations where  the  member  is  stationed  as  a  military  justice  matter.    These  actions  are  required whether or not a request for reconsideration is submitted. Section 3D— 3.22.  Adjudication  Generally.  Adjudication  of  a  claim  consists  of  making  the  findings necessary to determine whether the claim is payable and, if so, the appropriate amount to be paid under the PCA.  Claims personnel adjudicate claims carefully to compensate claimants fairly for loss or damage incident to their service. 3.22.1.  The  following  documents  are  required  for  the  adjudication  of  claims  referenced  in this  instruction.    Settlement  authorities  and  claims  personnel  should  have  access  to  each  of these documents. 3.22.1.1.  Allowance List - Depreciation Guide (ALDG, 1 Jun 07). 3.22.1.2.  Military-Industry Memorandum of  Understanding on Loss  and Damage Rules (24 Jan 92). 3.22.1.3.  Military-Industry  Memorandum  of  Understanding  on  Salvage  for  Code  1  and Code 2 Shipments (1 Apr 89). 3.22.1.3.1.  Military-Industry Memorandum of Understanding on Salvage for Code 1 and Code 2 Shipments Addendum (11 Jun 01). 3.22.1.4.  Joint Military-Industry Agreement on Carrier Recovery Claims $25 and Under (1 May 87). 3.22.1.5.  Joint Military-Industry Table of Weights (1 May 87). 3.22.1.6.  Non-Temporary Storage Depreciation Guide (1 May 87). 3.23.  Ensure Claim is Properly Payable.  Claims personnel shall review all evidence presented by  the  claimant  to  ensure  that  the  claim  is  payable  under  the  PCA,  consistent  with  this Instruction.  (T-1) 3.24.  Two-Person Policy.  When possible, one person investigates a claim, prepares the report, and recommends the action.  A separate individual will act as settlement authority and approve or disapprove the recommended action.  EXCEPTION:  For claims under $100 when settlement authority has been delegated to the examiner processing the claim.  (T-2) 3.25.  Measure  of  Damages.  After  determining  which  items  are  properly  payable,  claims personnel must determine the value of the claimant’s loss or damage.  (T-1) The Air Force uses 40 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 four measures to determine the value of loss of or damage to an item:  Fair Market Value, Full Replacement Value, Repair Cost, and “Fair and Reasonable" (F&R) compensation. 3.25.1.  Fair Market Value.  The PCA is intended to compensate claimants for the fair market value of their loss, and since most items owned by claimants are “used,” paying the claimant for the cost of a new item would be inappropriate, placing them in a better financial position than they were in before their loss.  Fair Market value is the amount the item was worth at the time  of  loss  or  damage.    Fair  Market  Value  is  either  a  value  determined  by  a  clearly established market or the Full Replacement Value minus depreciation.  Claims personnel pay the Fair Market Value for items missing or damaged beyond repair. 3.25.1.1.  Established  Market.    Value  may  be  determined  without  depreciation,  if  an established market exists which clearly sets the value for a class of items.  Such markets should  be  widely  accepted  and  recognized  by  the  community  as  a  whole  or  individuals and collectors in the business of trading or selling the items at issue.  Use such markets to establish the value of an item similar in age, quality, and condition to  the item claimed.  When an established fair market value exists, do not deduct depreciation. 3.25.1.2.  Appraisals.    An  appraisal  should  be  prepared  by  a  certified  appraiser.  Assessments in qualified appraisals reflect the Fair Market Value. 3.25.1.3.  Depreciated  Value.    When  no  appraisal  is  available  or  no  established  market exists,  value  is  established  by  depreciating  the  Full  Replacement  Value  of  an  item.    In order to award the claimant the market value of their “used” item, a depreciation rate is applied  to  a  new  item  of  similar  quality.    Ensure  the  item  used  to  determine  the replacement cost  is  as  close as possible in  quality, description, and  function  to  the item owned.  For personal property other than vehicles, these rates and guidance on their use are in the Allowance List-Depreciation Guide (ALDG). 3.25.1.3.1.  Claims personnel may decrease or increase the listed ALDG depreciation rate if evidence (such as an inspection  report,  a  photograph, or  a witness statement) indicates that the property was in better than average condition or worse than average condition before the incident giving rise to the claim.  The depreciation rate is based on the age, usage, or condition of the property before it was lost or damaged.  Make decisions to increase the rate of depreciation cautiously and make sure it is based on very good evidence. 3.25.1.3.2.  Do  not  depreciate  an  item  that  the  claimant  purchased  less  than  six months from the date of tender (for HHG, GPOV, or personal property in a vehicle) or the date when the loss or damage occurred (for Personnel Claims). 3.25.1.3.3.  In order to  determine the  appropriate depreciation  rate,  claims personnel determine the age of the item (in months).  To determine the age of an item, count the number  of  months  from  the  purchase  date  to  the  date  the  item  was  lost  or  damaged (Personnel  Claims)  or  tendered  to  a  TSP,  contractor,  or  warehouseman  (HHG  or personal property in a vehicle shipped under the GPOV program).  Do not count the actual  month  of  purchase  or tendered  or damaged/destroyed in determining the total number of months. the  goods  were the  month AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 41 3.25.1.3.4.  If  an  item  was  restored  to  an  almost  new  condition  after  the  claimant acquires it, measure the age of the item for depreciation purposes from the date of the repair, rather than the original purchase date. 3.25.1.3.5.  Never depreciate an item by more than 75 percent. 3.25.2.  Full Replacement Value.  Full replacement value is the cost to replace an item at the location where the loss is realized.  Claims personnel only pay the Full Replacement Value for items missing or damaged beyond repair and only under specified conditions found in the John  Warner  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  and  the  Ike  Skelton  National  Defense Authorization Act.  See paragraph 1.2.2. for additional information regarding this program. 3.25.3.  Repair Costs.  Claims personnel pay claimants the cost of repairing items when that cost is reasonable and does not exceed the value of the item.  Claimants may, on a case by case basis, also be compensated for any loss of value (LOV) suffered despite repair. 3.25.3.1.  The cost of repair should be substantiated.  This is most often accomplished by a paid bill or an estimate provided by a competent professional who is willing and able to make the repairs for the price stated.  Claims personnel may request a claimant to obtain a second estimate if the first appears unreasonably high. 3.25.3.2.  Routine maintenance is neither damage nor a repair.  Settlement authorities do not  pay  for  normal  maintenance  expenses,  including  charges  for  cleaning,  servicing, aligning,  or  tuning.    Settlement  authorities  may  pay  such  expenses  if  the  damage sustained was the proximate cause for the maintenance. 3.25.3.3.  Settlement  authorities  do  not  pay  for  the  reassembly  of  items  that  the  TSP disassembled.    Members  should  be  referred  to  the  local  transportation  office  for assistance. 3.25.4.  F&R  Payments.    Claims  personnel  may  set  an  F&R  payment  for  missing  or destroyed  property  if  they  decide  that  other  measures  would  under-compensate  or  over-compensate the claimant.  Because F&R payments may be subjective, do not use them when a more appropriate and/or reliable measure is available.  An F&R payment for a missing or destroyed  item  should  reflect  the  value  of  an  item  similar  in  quality,  description,  age, condition, and function to the greatest extent possible.  When making such payments, explain the basis for the award to the claimant.  Consider an F&R payment when: 3.25.4.1.  The item is obsolete. 3.25.4.2.  The claimant cannot replace the item in the local area. 3.25.4.3.  The claimant cannot replace the item at any cost. 3.25.4.4.  The  claimant  asks  for  a  replacement  price  considerably  higher  than  what  is reasonable for the item described. 3.25.4.5.  The claimant is unable to get a competent estimate of repair due to his location, e.g., some overseas areas, and the adjudicator feels  they can arrive at a fair amount and avoid lengthy deferrals. 3.26.  Pre-existing Damage (PED).  PED is damage to an item that predates the incident giving rise to a claim.  Claims personnel should make sure the damage claimed is not PED. 42 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 3.26.1.  Identify  Potential  PED.    Claims  personnel  should  review  documents  or  other evidence that identifies the condition of an item prior to the incident that damaged it.  If this evidence  shows  the  existence  of  PED,  compare  the  PED  with  the  damage  claimed.    If  the PED  and  claimed  damage  is  similar,  claims  personnel  may  need  additional  documentation, e.g.,  photographs  and  estimates  of  repair  to  distinguish  between  PED  and  possible  new damage. 3.26.2.  Deducting  PED.    Claims  personnel  do  not  pay  for  PED.    If  an  estimate  of  repair includes work done to repair PED, the cost of this repair is deducted from the claim.  (T-0)  Claims personnel should contact the repair firm to determine an appropriate deduction.  Such deductions are annotated in the claims file in a memorandum for record. 3.26.2.1.  When new damage to an item necessitates repairing PED at no additional cost, claims  personnel  pay  the  full  cost  of  repairs.    However,  deductions  should  be  taken  if there is more PED being repaired than new damage.  Contact the repair firm to determine an appropriate amount for the deduction. 3.27.  Insurance  or  Other  Third  Party  Payments.  Claims personnel ensure claimants do not receive  compensation  under  the  PCA  for  loss  or  damage  compensated  by  another  source,  to include payments by TSPs under FRV. 3.28.  Loss  of  Potential  Carrier  Recovery  (PCR).  PCR is money withheld from a claimant’s PCA award due to actions of the claimant that cost the Air Force money it otherwise could have recovered  from  a  TSP,  contractor,  or  warehouseman.    Claims  personnel  may  deduct  PCR whenever a claimant has limited the Government’s recovery rights  by failing to  file the 1840R (or equivalent) in a timely or complete manner. 3.28.1.  Unless claimant can clearly show good cause as to why he or she did not annotate the damage  claimed,  all  such  damage  is  subject  to  a  PCR  deduction.    The  settlement  authority determines the existence of good cause. 3.28.2.  Settlement  authorities  may  find  that  good  cause  existed  even  if  the  evidence  is insufficient  to  prove  the  same  to  the  TSP  under  the  Military-Industry  Memorandum  of Understanding  on  Loss  and  Damage  Rules.    Examples  of  the  good  cause  exception  to  the PCR deduction rule may include: 3.28.2.1.  Claimant’s temporary duty (TDY) away from his or her primary duty station. 3.28.2.2.  Hospitalization of claimant or immediate family member. 3.28.2.3.  Improper  counseling  from  Government  personnel  concerning  the  DD  Form 1840R. 3.28.2.4.  First time moves where the military member or civilian employee demonstrates justifiable confusion regarding timely notice. 3.28.3.  In cases where PCR is to be deducted from an item that has been lost or destroyed, claims  personnel  first  determine  the  amount  of  the  loss  or  damage  to  the  item.    For  items where  depreciation  is  applied,  deduct  the  potential  carrier  recovery.    This  is  done  by comparing the Service’s depreciation rate with the TSP, contractor, or warehouseman’s rate as  listed  in  the  ALDG  on  the  right  side.    When  the  TSP,  contractor,  or  warehouseman's depreciated value of an item is less than the Service's depreciated value, pay the claimant the difference between the two depreciated values.  For items where there is an established fair AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 43 market value (paragraph 3.25.1.1 of this Instruction) and depreciation is not applicable or for items  where  the  measure  of  the  damage  is  for  the  repair,  deduct  the  entire  amount  the  Air Force could have recovered from the claimant’s award. 3.29.  Salvage.  Items damaged beyond  repair (to include replacement  of  vehicle parts) may be salvaged  by  the  TSP  or  disposed  of  by  the  claimant  after  the  TSP  has  refused  their  rights  to salvage.  There is no process in place that provides easy salvage and disposal by the government.  As  a  guide,  the  Services’  agreement  with  the  TSP  industry  on  salvage  allows  for  a  25% deduction when TSPs are denied salvage.  Examiners should determine: 3.29.1.  The extent of the damage (while it may not be repairable and a replacement value is paid, it may still be usable). 3.29.2.  If the item is part of a set and the claimant would want to keep it even though it is damaged. 3.29.3.  If  it  is  a  large  piece  of  furniture  with  cosmetic  damage  or  an  appliance  that  has cosmetic damage but can be used for its intended purpose. 3.29.4.  If it is a family heirloom. NOTE:  If any of these situations apply, 25% should be deducted from both the claimant’s award and the TSP assertion and the settlement letter should read:  “When you are paid the replacement value of an item, the TSP has the right to pick up the item for salvage; therefore, we deducted 25% from the amount paid for (description of item) to allow you to keep the item.”  If the claimant requests reconsideration and is willing to let the TSP salvage the item, pay the claimant the balance and assert the full award value against the TSP. 3.30.  Repair and Replacement Expenses.  Settlement authorities may pay for certain expenses associated with the repair or replacement of personal property, including: 3.30.1.  Estimate fees.  Settlement authorities pay only for nonrefundable estimate fees, those for which a claimant has not  received credit toward payment  for the completion  of repairs.  This is true whether or not the claimant chooses to have the repairs done. 3.30.2.  Appraisals.  Settlement authorities do not routinely pay for an appraisal.  Appraisals are generally considered to be a cost associated with the preparation of a claim.  Settlement authorities may authorize payment for an appraisal by a certified appraiser only when it is in the best interest of the Air Force. 3.31.  Sales  Tax,  Shipping,  Handling,  Pickup,  Delivery,  and  Hazardous  Waste Fees.  Settlement  authorities  do  not  pay  for  disposal  of  items  to  be  replaced  or  unpaid  fees.  Payment may be authorized once paid receipts are provided to the CSC.  Claims personnel may pay the following costs if incurred by the claimant: 3.31.1.  Costs to replace property by mail. 3.31.2.  Costs of transporting property to or from a repair shop. 3.31.3.  Sales tax paid on items purchased to replace or repair lost or damaged property. 3.31.4.  Hazardous waste fees associated with repairs. 3.32.  Sets.  Sets  are  groups  of  complementary  and  related  articles  that  make  a  whole,  such  as crystal, china, furniture or stereo speakers.  As a general rule, when component parts of any set 44 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 are damaged beyond repair or missing, the claimant should only be reimbursed for the missing or damaged pieces.  An exception may be made when the claimant provides sufficient proof that the component pieces cannot be replaced, and as a result, the integrity of the set has been destroyed.  In  such  cases,  either  a  LOV  award  or  replacement  of  the  set  should  be  considered.    When  the entire set is replaced the TSP or the government may exercise salvage rights. 3.33.  Uniform  Claims.  Claims involving military  uniform  items,  for both  officer and  enlisted members, are first adjudicated under the PCA and the provisions of this chapter.  Both officers and  enlisted  personnel  receive  an  initial  monetary  allowance  to  purchase  uniform  items.    In addition, enlisted personnel receive an annual allowance to maintain uniforms.  As such, claims for  damage  or  destruction  of  uniform  items  due  to  routine  or  regularly  assigned  duties  are  not normally  paid  under  the  PCA.    If  payment  is  not  appropriate  under  the  PCA,  then  only  for enlisted member uniform items that are part of the enlisted clothing monetary allowance system (issue  uniform initiate  consideration  of reimbursement  under  the  provisions  and  procedures  of  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force  Materiel Management, Chapter 8.  Claims personnel should consult this provision of AFI 23-101 prior to final adjudication of any uniform item claim. items),  claims  personnel  notify  claimants to Section 3E— 3.34.  Action  of  Settlement  Authorities.  Settlement  Authorities  must  review  and  make  an independent assessment regarding disposition on all claims prior to approving or denying them.  (T-1)    This  includes  reviewing  the  examiner’s  recommendation,  inspection  reports,  witness statements,  and  claimant’s  substantiation  prior  to  taking  action.    Settlement  authorities  should ensure  the  file  contains  proper  documentation,  such  that  any  person  reviewing  the  file  in  the future  (for  TSP,  contractor  or  warehouseman  recovery  or  reconsideration)  may  clearly understand the decisions reached and the basis for the decision. 3.35.  Claims  Exceeding  $40,000  in  Adjudicated  Value.  Claims  may  be  paid  in  an  amount over  $40,000  (but  cannot  exceed  $100,000)  if  they  arose  from  an  emergency  evacuation  or extraordinary  circumstance.    For  claims  that  are  filed  based  on  an  evacuation  or  extraordinary circumstance  having  demand  amounts  over  $40,000  there  is  a  two-tier  claims  procedure  that applies.  The first tier is the adjudication of the initial $40,000 to speed up the initial recovery for the  service  member.    The  second  tier  is  adjudicated  for  claims  over  $40,000  and  the  Chief  or Deputy Chief of the CSC specifically assigns those claims to examiners at their discretion.  The following should be addressed in the initial $40,000 action: 3.35.1.  For loss or damage to HHGs exceeding $100,000 and caused by a hostile action, see AFI 51-501. 3.35.2.  Each  item  in  the  claim  is  adjudicated  and  the  claim  file  contains  sufficient information and documentation to support their adjudication. 3.35.3.  All ALDG item or category maximum allowable limits reached have been identified.  The CSC Operations Superintendent provides a determination on all such maximums before a  claim  is  forwarded  for  processing  over  $40,000.    (T-2)  The  claim  file  should  clearly document and support any decision to waive or not waive a maximum. 3.35.4.  The  claim  is  paid  up  to  his  or  her  settlement  authority  of  $40,000.    The  claim  file should contain a copy of the payment voucher and clearly state which items have been paid AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 45 and for what value.  Assert a recovery claim against the TSP, contractor or warehouseman, if applicable. 3.35.5.  The  claimant  is  sent  an  award  letter.    (T-1)    Include  in  the  $40,000  award  letter  a notice that the claim is being further processed consistent with the original demand amount.  Do not include reconsideration rights in the letter. 3.35.6.  The  original  claims  examiner  shall  prepare  a  memorandum.   The memorandum  should  include  a  summary  of  all  relevant  facts  and  legal  issues,  a recommendation regarding the additional payment  and the status  of any  ongoing contractor recovery effort.   (T-3) 3.35.7.  Adjudication of the remaining portion of the claim will be conducted by the second tier examiner and monitored by the Chief, CSC until settlement of the remaining portion of the claim.  (T-3) 3.36.  Deferred Items.  Claimants who have not provided sufficient substantiation for an item or claim  after  being  notified,  may  have  their  claim  (or  specific  items)  denied  or  deferred  by  the settlement authority.  The claimant is notified of the deferred items in a settlement letter, clearly establishing  a  specified  period  for  the  claimant  to  provide  the  additional  substantiation.    (T-3)  Claims  personnel  should  defer  items  only  if  they  believe  the  needed  evidence  exists  and  is readily obtainable.  Settlement letters containing deferred items inform the claimant that a failure to provide the additional information by time set in the letter may result in the items being denied and the claim closed. 3.37.  Settlement.  Once  a  settlement  authority  has  made  a  final  determination  on  a  claim,  the claimant will be promptly notified by claims personnel.  (T-3)  When authorities settle the claim, claims personnel record the action in the appropriate blocks on the DD Form 1842 and generate an SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchase and Service Other Than Personal, for signature of the settlement  authority.    (T-3)    The  signature  of  the  settlement  authority  verifies  that  the  claim meets all requirements for payment in the amount specified or that the claim warrants denial. 3.37.1.  At  least  one  form  of  notification  will  be  by  letter.    (T-3)  The  letter  to  the  claimant should be detailed and: 3.37.1.1.  State the amount claimed and the total award approved. 3.37.1.2.  Identify the items denied or reduced and give the claimant a detailed, clear, and understandable reason for the action. 3.37.1.3.  Include a copy of the claim adjudication worksheet as an attachment. 3.37.1.4.  Explain to the claimant his or her reconsideration rights and the process. 3.37.2.  Settlement authorities should, if practicable, memorialize the basis for all awards  or denials  in  a  memorandum  placed  in  the  claim  file.    Claims  personnel  must  create  such  a memorandum  if  the  claim  involved  unique  facts  or  application  of  the  PCA.    (T-3)    Such documentation must also be added to the file if claims personnel expect the claimant to file a reconsideration request, Inspector General Complaint, or Congressional Inquiry.  (T-3) 3.38.  Paying Approved Claims.  Once settlement authorities approve a claim for payment, the signed SF Form 1034 is given to the CSC Accounting Clerk. 46 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 3.39.  Recovered  Property.  Recovered  property  is  property  claimed  missing  but  later  found either  during  adjudication  of  the  claim  or  after  the  claimant  has  been  paid.    Missing  items  are those items whose location is unknown and is not expected to be determined within a reasonable time.  Delayed property (whose location is known) is not missing. 3.39.1.  Property  Recovered  During  Adjudication.    Generally,  settlement  authorities  do  not pay for property that is recovered prior to settlement of a claim.  However, in rare instances, items discovered before a claim is settled may be paid if claimants do not desire to accept the found  property.    The  claimant  may  not  wish  to  retain  such  items.    This  is  authorized  only when all of the following elements are met: 3.39.1.1.  The item has been missing for an unreasonable period of time from the date of incident or expected arrival date; 3.39.1.2.  The  item  is  necessary  for  daily  life,  such  that  it  must  be  replaced  within  a reasonable time; 3.39.1.3.  The item has in fact been replaced; and 3.39.1.4.  The item must be of a durable nature and not routinely replaced.  Items, such as socks, undergarments, cosmetics, and food, are routinely replaced and would not qualify under this provision. 3.39.2.  Property  Located  After  Settlement.    If  lost  property  is  located  after  a  settlement authority has approved the claim for payment, claims personnel shall advise the claimant of his or her options to either:  (T-1) 3.39.2.1.  Accept  any  or  all  of  the  items  located  and  repay  the  amount  already  paid  for such items. 3.39.2.2.  Disclaim in writing further interest and ownership in the property and keep the amount that the settlement authority has approved for payment. 3.39.3.  If the settlement authority determines the recovered property is substantially different in quality, quantity, or price from the property claimed, the settlement authority may require the claimant to return the amount allowed for such property and accept the property. 3.39.4.  Recovered  property  that  has  not  been  included  in  any  claim  is  returned  to  the member. 3.40.  Erroneous  Payment.  An  erroneous  payment  is  a  payment  that  settlement  authorities make:  (1)  based  on  facts  from  the  claimant  that  are  later  determined  to  be  incorrect,  or  (2) without legal authority.  A claim is paid without legal authority if it was paid without the specific authorization of the PCA as implemented by this Instruction. 3.40.1.  Erroneous payments should be recouped when it is found that the claimant provided false  information  or  if  the  CSC  had  no  authority  to  pay  the  claim.    This  can  be  done  by  a voluntary  collection  in  full,  or  in  installment  payments,  once  a  claimant  has  acknowledged receipt  of  the  demand  for  payment.    It  may  be  deducted  through  payroll  deductions  if claimant refuses to return the money voluntarily. All payments should be received in a timely manner and promptly deposited.  If a claimant stops making payments, the CR Flight collects the balance due through involuntary collection. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 47 3.40.2.  Involuntary Collection.  If the claimant refuses to repay voluntarily or fails to meet an arranged payment schedule, the CR Flight collects the amount owed through involuntary collection.    Generally,  claims  personnel  prepare  a  DD  Form  139,  Pay  Adjustment Authorization, for DFAS and submit it through their local AFO to collect.  Contact the local AFO for specific guidance on local procedures. Section 3F— 3.41.  Reconsiderations  Generally.  Reconsideration  is  the  review  of  an  initial  settlement action.  A claimant or claimant’s agent who is not satisfied with the outcome of his or her claim may  request  that  it  be  reconsidered.    A  reconsideration  authority  may  reverse  any  previous claims settlement decisions, including denying the entire claim, if appropriate.  A reconsideration authority’s  decision  is  final  and  conclusive,  and  claimants  may  not  appeal  the  decision  of  a reconsideration authority to any other Air Force agency or court. 3.41.1.  Claimants submit requests for reconsideration within 60 days of the claim settlement date  and  provide  a  legal  basis  or  evidence  to  support  their  claim.    The  reconsideration authority may waive the 60-day period for good cause.  This good cause and the decision to waive the time requirement is documented in the file. 3.41.2.  If  claims  personnel  discover  adjudication  errors  or  new  facts  after  settlement,  they may  reopen  a  claim  without  a  request  from  the  claimant  (Resume  Processing  in WebAFCIMS) and re-adjudicate it.  Such self-identified actions are not reconsiderations. 3.42.  The  Initial  Settlement  Authority.  The  initial  settlement  authority  is  the  settlement authority that originally acted on the claim.  That person reviews any request for reconsideration and, based on the claim file and the evidence presented in the reconsideration request, determine whether to grant relief as follows:   (T-1) 3.42.1.  Approve payment for the full amount requested; or 3.42.2.  Approve  payment  for  the  full  amount  requested,  applying  appropriate  depreciation; or 3.42.3.  Approve  payment  less  than  the  amount  requested,  provided  the  claimant  agrees  to accept the amount and the acceptance is documented in the file; or 3.42.4.  Forward  the  claim  to  the  reconsideration  authority  for  final  settlement  if  the  claim does  not  merit  a  full,  depreciated,  or  agreed-to  settlement.    Prepare  a  memorandum documenting  the  relevant  facts,  history  and  providing  a  recommendation  for  each  item contained in the reconsideration request. 3.43.  The  Reconsideration  Authority.  Any  settlement  authority  specifically  delegated  in  this instruction may act as reconsideration authority up to their maximum amount of their authority.  Reconsideration authority may not be further delegated. 3.43.1.  No  settlement  authority  may  act  as  reconsideration  authority  if  that  settlement authority took initial action on the claim or was actively involved in the adjudication of the claim.  Merely acting on an ALDG item or category maximum allowable does not disqualify the reconsideration authority.  Otherwise, settlement authorities should pass reconsideration requests  to  the  next  higher  settlement  authority  if  there  is  even  the  appearance  that  the settlement authority was actively involved in the initial adjudication of the claim. 48 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 3.44.  Reconsideration  Actions.  The  reconsideration  authority  personally  decides  all  requests for reconsideration within his or her settlement authority if the person who originally settled the claim denies relief.  The individual assuming the reconsideration authority on any given claim: 3.44.1.  Conducts  an  independent  and  personal  review  of  the  claim  and  reconsideration request, item by item;  (T-1) 3.44.2.  Must  be  familiar  with  the  requirements  of  the  PCA,  adjudication  rules  in  this Instruction, the ALDG, AFCIMS, and current CSC guidance;  (T-1) 3.44.3.  Reviews  the  file,  and  as  necessary,  talks  with  claims  personnel  who  worked  the claim, gathers further evidence, and talks with the claimant; (T-1) 3.44.4.  Acts on all requests for reconsideration within 30 days  (T-1); and 3.44.5.  Sends  the  claimant  a  letter  upon  settling  the  claim.    The  reconsideration  authority shall clearly explain in the letter the basis for his or her determination and shall state that the determination is final.  (T-1) AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 49 Chapter 4 PROCESSING AND SETTLING CARRIER RECOVERY CLAIMS 4.1.  Introduction.  The basis for a TSP recovery or carrier recovery (CR) claim is the failure of a TSP, warehouseman, or contractor to adequately protect goods entrusted to them for shipment.  The  goods  must  be  delivered  in  the  same  condition  as  when  the  TSP  took  possession  of  them.  This chapter details the basic tasks for a claims examiner to process a carrier recovery claim. 4.1.1.  Full  Replacement  Value  (FRV)  Claims  Program.    See  paragraph  1.2.2.  for  an explanation of the FRV Program.  Only claims for loss, damage, or destruction of household goods filed directly with the CSC, or properly transferred to the CSC from a TSP, are within the scope of this chapter.  Be advised that payments  for loss, damage, or destruction under this chapter may be affected by payments under the FRV Claims Program. 4.1.2.  The Government presents a legally sufficient (prima facie) case of TSP liability when it shows: 4.1.2.1.  The TSP received the goods, 4.1.2.2.  in a certain condition of which the TSP is required to have record, 4.1.2.3.  the  TSP  did  not  deliver  the  goods  or  delivered  them  in  a  more  damaged condition as annotated on a timely filed DD Form 1840/1840R (or equivalent), and 4.1.2.4.  the amount of loss or damage. 4.1.3.  Two legal  authorities establish our prima facie  case, the  Carmack  Amendment  to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 USC § 14706, and Missouri Pacific R.R. v. Elmore & Stahl, 377 U.S. 134, 138 (1964).  Once the Air Force has established each of the elements for the prima facie  case, the burden shifts  to  the TSP to  show the loss or damage did  not  result from  the TSP’s failure to exercise reasonable care to protect the goods. 4.1.4.  TSP  rebuttal  arguments  should  question  one  of  the  four  elements  that  establish  the prima  facie  case  of  TSP  liability  and  where  possible  should  cite  a  legal  authority.    The following  are  examples  of  legal  authorities  which  the  TSP  have  access:  Defense  Office  of Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  decisions;  Military/Industry  Memoranda  of  Understanding (MOUs);  Defense  Transportation  Regulation  4500.9-R  (DTR)  (contains  the  Tender  of Service  (TOS)  Agreement  and  the  Basic  Ordering  Agreement  for  Storage);  Joint  Military-Industry  Depreciation  Guide  (JMIDG);  and  any  other  relevant  statutes,  contracts,  and regulations. 4.2.  Review.  The Carrier Recovery Flight Supervisor oversees the assignment of claims taking into account the settlement authority of each paralegal and should: 4.2.1.  Look  at  each  TSP  recovery  claim  objectively  and  independently.    Paying  a  claimant does not always equate to TSP liability.  Only request payment on damage for which a TSP is liable. 4.2.2.  Review  the  Government  Bill  of  Lading  (GBL).    This  is  the  Government’s  contract with the TSP. Confirm the name of the TSP on the GBL, inventory, and the DD Form 1840 is the same.  This ensures the correct TSP is being held liable for the loss/damage. 50 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 4.2.2.1.  Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC) (Block #2).  This is a four-letter code used to identify the agent who bills the Air Force for transportation related services. 4.2.2.2.  Service Code (Block #3).  This  code can identify the type of property shipped, how it was moved, mode of transportation, and limitations of TSP liability. 4.2.2.3.  Shipment No. (Block #4).  Members may have more than one household goods shipment and knowing this can explain unrelated documents in the file. 4.2.2.4.  Owner Name (Block #10).  Compare this information to other documentation in the  file.    Ensure  subrogation  claims  are  asserted  on  behalf  of  the  correct  member  on military married to military moves. 4.2.2.5.  Extra Pickup/Delivery (Block #13).  This can reflect goods picked up from more than one residence or storage facility. 4.2.2.6.  Department/Agency  (Block  #14).    Affiliation  in  this  block  should  read USAFunless a special provision allows otherwise. 4.2.2.7.  Pickup  Location  (Block  #19).    This  block  shows  the  household  goods  were picked up from a Non-Temporary Storage (NTS) facility. 4.2.2.8.  Remarks  (Block  #25).    This  lists  special  instructions  to  include  Storage-In-Transit  (SIT)  increase  to  the  TSP’s  basic  liability  valuation  based  upon  purchase  of additional coverage.  This block may also identify whether a shipment is  covered FRV, with a potential increase of basic valuation to $4.00 times the net weight of the shipment.  Whether  a  shipment  is  covered  under  FRV  may  also  be  determined  by  the  solicitation under which the shipment is moved.  That information is usually found in Block 31. 4.2.2.9.  Shipment Weight (Block #28).  This is not always entered.  The shipment weight can be found on the DD Form 1840/1840R or by contacting the origin/destination TMO office.    The  weight  should  not  be  overlooked  since  it  determines  the  TSP’s  maximum liability. 4.2.2.10.  BLUEBARK (Block #10).  These words sometimes appear in Block 27.  This designation is used for a shipment to the next of kin of a deceased military member. 4.2.3.  Verify  that  the  GBL  TSP  is  not  nonuse  or  bankrupt  by  using  Surface  Deployment Distribution Command’s (SDDC) Approved Carrier listing web site.  If so, return the file to the  Recovery  Flight  Superintendent,  who  assigns  it  to  the  claims  paralegal  handling bankrupt/nonuse TSPs. 4.2.4.  Review the DD Form 1840.  Examine the following: 4.2.4.1.  Shipper’s Name.  This must be the same as in the GBL and inventory 4.2.4.2.  Shipment Weight.  This is necessary to determine maximum TSP liability 4.2.4.3.  GBL Number.  This must match the GBL in the claim file 4.2.4.4.  Carrier  Name/Address  (Block  #9).    The  DD  Form  1840R  is  dispatched  to  this address 4.2.4.5.  Code of Service (Block #10).  If this block contains a two-letter service code that begins with “B” or “H” then it is a Direct Procurement Method (DPM) shipment.  DPM AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 51 shipments  are  not  offset  through  CSC  and  DFAS  but  are  sent  to  the  base’s  contracting office if settlement is not reached. 4.2.4.6.  SCAC. 4.2.4.7.  Signatures. 4.2.4.8.  Date of Delivery. 4.2.5.  Review the DD Form 1840R and Electronic Equivalent in Online Filing.  This form is used  to  notify  the  TSP  of  damage  or  loss  discovered  after  delivery,  but  within  75  days  of delivery.  Verify that every item asserted against the TSP is listed on the DD Form 1840, the DD Form 1840R, or a properly completed continuation sheet. 4.2.5.1.  Section  B  –  Name/address  of  Carrier.    This  should  be  addressed  to  the TSP/contractor that is listed in BLOCK # 9 on the DD Form 1840. 4.2.5.2.  Dispatch Date.  To assert a TSP recovery claim, this date cannot exceed the 75th day  of  delivery  (Exception:  unusual  circumstances  such  as  a  lengthy  TDY  or hospitalization; supporting documents should be included in the file). 4.2.6.  Ensure  the  correct  inventory  is  in  the  file.    The  top  right-hand  corner  will  normally specify the carrier’s reference number, contract number if it is from NTS and GBL number. 4.2.7.  Review  the  DD  Form  1842  and  Electronic  Equivalent  in  Online  Filing.    Review  the name on the form, amounts paid by the AF, if any, and if the claimant had private insurance.  See Paragraph 3.15. regarding insurance coverage for losses or damage to household goods moved or stored at government expense. 4.2.8.  Review the DD Form 1844.  Review the claims examiner’s adjudication: 4.2.8.1.  Verify  all  items  listed  on  the  DD  Form  1844,  List  of  Property  and  Claim Analysis Chart, are on either the DD Form 1840 or 1840R.  If items are listed on the DD Form 1840R, verify the 1840R was dispatched to the proper TSP and within 75 days of delivery.    If  there  are  items  listed  on  the  DD  Form  1844  that  are  not  listed  on  the  DD Form  1840/1840R,  there  may  be  no  TSP  liability  for  that  item  and  PCR  should  be deducted. 4.2.8.2.  Make  sure  all  items  on  the  claim  have  been  settled.    If  there  are  any reconsiderations or deferred items still pending, return  the claim to the Chief, Recovery Flight, who returns it to the appropriate Flight Chief. 4.2.8.3.  Determine whether the shipment was delivered from a non-temporary warehouse facility,  and  if  so,  ensure  that  depreciation  IAW  the  NTS  Depreciation  Guide  was applied. 4.2.8.3.1.  Any  and  all  items  claimed  with  the  member’s  insurance  company  should also be listed on the DD Form 1844.  After the TSP has made payment on the claim, or in the event of offset, the insurance company is entitled to a share of the recovery.  This type of claim is commonly referred to as a CRI (carrier recovery to the insurance company for their pro rata share). 4.2.8.3.2.  For all claims involving insurance, mark the front of the file folder “CRI” in  large  letters  to  alert  others  there  is  an  additional  process  to  be  completed  once 52 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 settlement  is  reached  or  the  offset  is  complete.    Do  not  close  the  claim  in  AFCIMS until the CRI is processed IAW the CSC Operating Instruction for processing CRIs. 4.2.8.3.3.  Compare  the  amount  the  claimant  was  paid  to  the  amount  of  the  TSP’s liability  for each item  claimed.   If the TSP’s liability is  more, mark the line “CRC” and  the  difference.    CRC  indicates  carrier  recovery  to  the  claimant.    If  the  total difference for the claim is more than $25, mark the front of the file folder “CRC” in red  marker  to  alert  others  there  is  an  additional  process  to  be  completed  once settlement  is  reached  or  the  offset  is  complete.    Do  not  close  the  claim  in  AFCIMS until the CRC is processed IAW the CSC guidance for processing CRCs. 4.2.8.3.4.  If  the  claims  examiner  needs  to  make  changes/revisions  to  the  DD  Form 1844,  copy  the  original  and  make  your  changes  on  the  copy.  Recalculate  the  TSP’s liability  and  place  the  calculation  tape  on  the  revised  DD  Form  1844.    Place  the revised DD Form 1844 on the left hand side of the file folder.  Include a signed and dated MFR in the file explaining why it was necessary to make the changes. 4.2.9.  Verify  that  the  notice  requirements  of  the  Federal  Debt  Recovery  Act  are  met  and documented in the file.  Correct deficiencies in notice or documentation.  Ensure an adequate response was submitted to all TSP correspondence addressing all of the TSP’s concerns. 4.3.  Processing.  If  after  reviewing  the  claim  the  paralegal  agrees  with  the  TSP’s  offer,  the paralegal  responds  with  a  letter  of  acceptance  and  include  the  specific  date  the  CSC  should receive the check.  Suspense the file for that date.  If no check is received within 120 days from assertion, send the TSP a letter notifying them the claim may be forwarded for offset since they failed to provide payment as agreed.  Include a signed and dated MFR in the file and return the file to the Chief, Recovery Flight, who handles the offset procedure. 4.3.1.  Paralegals  may only settle claims within  their settlement  authority.   If the settlement amount  is  above  the  paralegal’s  authority,  he  or  she  should  provide  a  signed  written recommendation and place it on the left inside of the claim file and submit the claim to the Chief, Recovery Flight, for approval.  The approving authority should write “Reviewed and Approved” and other desired comments on the claims paralegal’s recommendation, then date and sign it. 4.3.2.  If the TSP’s check is already in the file and is current, it is ready to be processed for deposit  (see  Section  4.4).    Ensure  the  check  is  for  the  amount  of  the  demand  or  has  been approved  for  a  lesser  amount.    (T-2)    Depositing  the  check  has  the  effect  of  accepting  the TSP’s counter-offer of payment, even if it is significantly lower than the demand.  The CSC has  no  opportunity  to  request  more  money  from  a  TSP  once  the  check  has  been  deposited, even if it is deposited in error. 4.3.3.  If the TSP’s check is already in the file but has expired, copy the check and return the original to the TSP with a letter accepting their offer and requesting a new check for the full amount and include the specific date the CSC should receive the check.  Suspense the file for that  date.    If  no  check  is  received  within  120  days  from  assertion,  claims  personnel  should send the TSP a letter notifying them the claim will be forwarded for offset since they failed to provide payment as agreed.  Include a signed and dated MFR in the file and return the file to the Chief, Recovery Flight. AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 53 4.3.4.  If the claims examiner disagrees with the TSP’s offer, claims personnel should prepare a letter stating the AF position and cite all applicable MOUs, statutes, DOHA decisions, etc. as stated in Para. 4.1.3. above. 4.3.5.  The TSP has 120 days to settle the claim.   If attempts at settlement are unsuccessful after 120 days, claims personnel should draft a letter recommending offset and give the file to the Chief, Recovery Flight. 4.4.  Check Accountability, Security, and Depositing Procedures 4.4.1.  Check Accountability and Security.  Checks are retrieved from incoming mail by CSC postal personnel and given to the Carrier Recovery Flight (CRF).  CRF matches checks with claim numbers and places them onto a daily check log and transfers accountability to CSC.  The CSC will verify and receipt for checks by signing daily check log and providing CR with a  signed  copy  for  accountability  purposes.    (T-2)  The  CSC  will  enter  checks  on  a  master check  log  and  secure  the  checks  in  a  safe  until  their  final  disposition  is  determined.  (T-2)  Checks  are  maintained  and  controlled  IAW  DOD  Financial  Management  Regulation (DODFMR) Volume 5, Chapter 3.  (T-0) 4.4.2.  Depositing  Checks.    The  Carrier  Recovery  Flight  prepares  a  DD  Form  1131,  Cash Collection Voucher, to deposit checks and provides to the CSC.  (T-0)  The CSC will use a 2-person verification process to ensure all checks and amounts are correctly listed on the DD Form  1131.    (T-2)    Checks  are  marked  deposited  on  the  master  check  log  after  the verification of deposit is complete.  (T-2)  Deposit slips will be prepared and checks taken to the  bank  for  deposit  in  a  US  Treasury  account.      (T-2)    Deposits  of  $100,000.00  or  more requires an escort.   (T-2)  CSC/FM sends DD Form 1131 and deposit receipt to the servicing AFO for verification of deposit and assignment of voucher number.  (T-2)  Deposits will be verified  using  Commanders  Resource  Integration  System  (CRIS)  by  matching  the  voucher number,  amount  and  transaction  date.    (T-2)    Transaction  dates  are  annotated  on  DD  Form 1131 and maintained by the CSC.  (T-2) 4.5.  Unearned  Transportation  Charges.  TSPs  bill  the  Air  Force  for  the  personal  property weight that the service member ships.  Under the TOS, if a TSP loses or destroys property they were  paid  to  ship,  they  are  not  entitled  to  compensation  for  transporting  the  lost  or  destroyed item unless the TSP gives the member full replacement value for all lost or destroyed items.  The deduction  associated  with  having  been  paid  to  transport  lost  or  destroyed  items  is  called unearned transportation.  The Joint Personal  Property Shipping Office (JPPSO) deducts  money from  TSPs for unearned transportation.  When a claim  includes missing  or destroyed items  for which  the  member  has  not  been  given  full  replacement  value  for  all  items,  claims  examiners notify  JPPSO  that  a  deduction  against  the  TSP  for  unearned  transportation  charges  is  in  order.  Claims examiners satisfy this requirement by forwarding a JPPSO Package.  The JPPSO Package should contain: 4.5.1.  Copy of initial assertion letter to the TSP. 4.5.2.  DD  Form  1844.    Highlight  all  items  in  which  the  TSP  is  liable  for  the  full  or depreciated  replacement  cost.    Annotate  “AP”  (Amount  Paid)  for  that  item.    If  the  claim involves only repaired items, a JPPSO package is not required. 4.5.3.  GBL 54 AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 NOTE:  JPPSO packages are not prepared for DPM or NTS shipments. 4.6.  Database  Inputs.  The  Chief,  Recovery  Flight  makes  the  appropriate  AFCIMS  or  other database  inputs  for  claims  needing  to  be  forwarded  to  other  Flights.    The  claims  examiner completes the appropriate AFCIMS input for all other dispositions. 4.7.  Administrative  Errors  Less  than  $25.  In  accordance  with  the  Joint  Military-Industry Agreement, no refund is made because of an error, administrative or otherwise, on a claim if the refund is $25.00 or less.  If CSC is refunding other items and the payment is over $25.00, CSC refunds the error.  In exchange for this agreement not to grant refunds for $25.00 or less, the TSP industry  and  the  Military  Claims  Services  have  agreed  not  to  offset  claims  where  the  dollar amount is $25.00 or less. 4.8.  Claimant  Paybacks  (Recoupment).  The  Chief,  CSC,  is  the  only  person  authorized  to waive  a  payback.    (T-3)    The  claims  examiner  should  prepare  a  signed  and  dated  MFR explaining  that  the  amount  was  found  and  make  a  written  recommendation  as  to  payment  or waiver in the best interest of the Air Force.  Present the claim file with the recommendation to the Chief, Recovery Flight. 4.9.  Offset Recommendations.  It is important to review the evidence that establishes elements of  the  prima  facie  case  in  conjunction  with  the  TSP  arguments  relative  to  the  laws,  contracts, regulations,  MOUs,  and  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeal  (DOHA)  decisions  before recommending a claim for offset.

Congress has passed these laws in recognition that the personal property of armed forces personnel is often subject to greater risks than civilians' property because of the nature of their service.   The benefits Congress has provided service personnel has significantly increased over the years to take into account the changing nature of the service as well as unique situations that members face.  However, the laws Congress enacted were never meant to replace the need for the individual member and employee to purchase private insurance to fully protect his or her property. 1816   On 9 April 1816, Congress authorized the payment for property lost, captured, or destroyed by the enemy               while in the military service of the United States and for other purposes. 14 Cong Ch 40; 3 Stat 261.  1849  Another statute that followed in 1849 was limited to loss of personal horses (POV).  30 Cong Ch 129; 9 Stat 414.  1885  On 3 March 1885, Congress gave military personnel the right to file claims for property determined to be                   reasonable, useful, necessary, and proper for an officer or enlisted man to have while in quarters or engaged in public service in the line of duty.  Recovery was limited to cases of lost or destroyed property shipped by competent orders aboard an unseaworthy vessel; or loss or destruction of such property when the owner gave his attention to saving government property in danger.  This statute excluded claims for losses due to war or Indian hostilities.  48 Cong Ch 335; 23 Stat 350. 1915       The 1885 Act was extended to cover loss or damage to baggage in shipment under orders.   1918 The 1885 Act was further extended to include members of the Nurses Corps, and covered losses in both war and peace time.  That Act also provided that items required by regulation could be claimed, as well as the items mentioned under the 1885 Act.  40 Stat 880.   The Act of 4 March 1921 amended the 1885 Act and incorporated the provisions of the 1915 and 1918 amendments into one statute and extended the scope of the Act to cover losses sustained in an incident where the property owner gave his attention to saving-human life or government property, or where property damage resulted from authorized military duties.  66 PL 391; 66 Cong Ch 163; 41 Stat 1436. The 3 July 1943 Act extended coverage to civilian-employees of the Army or War Department, authorized the Secretary of War to delegate his authority to settle claims, and included a finality of settlement provision.  Before this Act, all personnel claim settlements were subject to final review by the Comptroller General.  78 Cong Ch 189; 78 PL 112. 1921 1943 1945  On 29 May 1945, the Military Personnel Claims Act was enacted and it repealed all previous legislation.  This Act enlarged the administrative powers of the Secretary of War with respect to personnel claims.  The Judge Advocate General of the Army took final action on all personnel claims under his delegation from the Secretary of War until this statutory authority was transferred, for Air Force personnel, to the Air Force in July 1949.  The Act also provided for consideration of claims of military and civilian personnel of the Department when the property was determined to be reasonable, useful, necessary, or proper under attendant circumstances as prescribed by regulation, and the loss, damage, destruction, capture, or abandonment was incident to service.  Another provision was that any such claim would be paid unless it was caused in whole or in part by negligence of the claimant, his agent or employee, or occurred at quarters the claimant occupied within the CONUS (excluding Alaska) that the government did not assign to him or her or otherwise provided in kind.  The three last provisions of this Act included a one year statute of limitations (but did include a war saving clause), made action of the Secretary or his designees final, and placed no statutory ceiling on the amount of payment.  79 Cong Ch 135; 79 PL 67; 59 Stat 225.  1952  On 3 July 1952, Congress amended the 1945Act by (1) providing that the Secretary of the Department  involved or his designee could not pay any claim in excess of $2,500; (2) providing for payment of survivor claims; (3) increasing the statute of limitations from one year to two years; and (4) requiring that heads of the Departments make an annual report to Congress of claims paid under the Act.  82 Cong Ch 548; 82 PL 439.  In June 1956, the statutory maximum was increased to $6,500, retroactive to July 1952. 84 PL 571; 84 Cong Ch 376.    AFI51-502  5 AUGUST 2016 61 1964      In August 1964, Congress enacted the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees' Claims Act.  This Act               1980 restated the law that was in effect at that time and made it applicable to all federal agencies; it also increased the settlement authority to $10,000 for military departments and the Coast Guard.  An attorney fee provision was included in the law for the first time; it limited the fee to 10 percent of the amount paid in settlement of each claim. 88 PL 558; 78 Stat 767. On 18 October 1974, Congress increased the amount payable to $15,000.  93 PL 455; 88 Stat 1381. In December 1980, Congress increased the amount payable to $40,000 for any claim for damage or loss of personal property in a foreign country incurred on or after 31 December 1978, which resulted from: evacuation from the country on the recommendation or order of the Secretary of State or other competent authority, political unrest or hostile acts by people in that country, and/or acts of mob violence, terrorist attacks, or other hostile acts directed against the United States Government, its officers, or employees.  96 PL 519; 94 Stat 3031. 1982  On 28 July 1982, Congress increased the maximum amount payable to $25,000 for claims arising on or after that date; the increase was not retroactive.  97 PL 226; 96 Stat 245. 1988  On 31 October 1988, Congress increased the maximum amount payable on personal property claims to 1991 $40,000.  100 PL 565; 102 Stat 2833. In June 1991, the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption near Clark AB, Republic of the Philippines, caused millions of dollars in both government and personal property damage and loss.   1992     In August 1992, Hurricane Andrew totally devastated Homestead AFB, Florida, also resulting in millions of dollars of government and personal property damage.  Following these two huge disasters, at least 150 Air Force members suffered catastrophic losses of their household property which exceeded the present $40,000 payment limit under the Personnel Claims statute.   1996      In response, the Air Force initiated legislative effort to provide further claims payment for these individuals and future claimants.  The final legislative result is Section 1088 of the Fiscal Year 1996 National Defense    Authorization Act (NDAA).  This legislation contains two parts: 1) a service secretary may approve payment beyond $40,000 up to $100,000 for claims which arise from "emergency evacuations and extraordinary circumstances;" and 2) the new secretarial authority may be applied retroactively to the beginning of the Personnel Claims Act.  104 PL 106; 110 Stat 186. 2006  On 17 October 2006, Congress amended 10 USC 2636a to authorize the Secretary of Defense to contract with carriers to provide for full replacement value on loss or damage to baggage and household goods of active duty military members and civilian employees.  The deadline for contract changes was established as 1 March 2008.  109 PL 364; 120 Stat 2083 (2167).    2011  On 7 Jan 2011, Congress authorized the military services to pay full replacement value under limited circumstances when household goods are lost or destroyed during a shipment where any part of the shipment was carried under a contract that provided for full replacement value.  The limited circumstances include situations where the carrier is excluded from liability, the damage occurred while in the possession of an ocean carrier, or a carrier denies liability claiming a prior handler is responsible.  111 PL 383; 124 Stat 4194.
