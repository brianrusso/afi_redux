Overview.  Airfield  damage  assessment  is  the  process  of  locating, classifying, and measuring airfield damage and unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) after an attack. Traditionally, this task is performed by Airfield Damage Assessment  Teams traveling predetermined routes and reporting damage to the Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS) Selection Cell.  1.1.1.  The  MAOS  Selection  Cell  should  be  co-located  with  the  Emergency Operations  Center  (EOC)  whenever  possible.  (Note:  damage  is  recorded  and plotted  in  the  alternate  EOC  and  Civil  Engineer  [CE]  Unit  Control  Center [UCC]  to  provide  redundancy  and  crosschecks  for  accuracy).  The  MAOS Selection  Cell is  managed under Emergency Support Function (ESF) 3-Public Works  and  Engineering  Responsibilities.  The  MAOS  Selection  Cell  is subordinate to the EOC Director and serves as an advisory element to the EOC and Installation Commander. The ADATs collect necessary data for the MAOS selection  cell  to  select  at  least  three  MAOS  candidates  to  be  briefed  to  the Installation Commander as soon as possible after the attack. 1.1.2.  From  an  engineering  perspective,  damage  assessment  activities  are categorized two  distinct  areas:  airfield  damage  assessment  and facility/utility  damage  assessment.  Resources  permitting,  both  assessment operations should be conducted simultaneously and, depending on the situation at hand, may be of equal importance.  1.1.2.1.  Airfield  damage  assessment  includes  evaluation  of  runway,  taxiway, and parking apron surfaces, and airfield infrastructure such as lighting, aircraft arresting systems, utility lines, signage, etc. The ADATs should also report any visual damage to navigational aids (NAVAIDs) along their routes. The ADAT model will eventually transition towards the Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment System  (RADAS)  concept,  whereby  airfield  damage  assessment  is  conducted via remote sensors mounted on unmanned vehicles, stationary towers, and other platforms.  RADAS  will  remove  personnel  from  the  hazardous  UXO-laden environment and should significantly accelerate the assessment process. 1.1.2.2. Facility damage assessment includes evaluation of damage to all other airbase facilities, infrastructure, and utility systems. into AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         5  1.1.3.  This  publication  is  limited  to  airfield  damage  assessment  procedures. Facility  damage  assessment,  conducted  by  teams  referred  to  as  Damage Assessment  and  Response  Teams  (DART),  is  presented  in  AFPAM  10-219, Volume 3, Civil Engineer Disaster and Attack Recovery Procedures.  1.2.  General  Information.  The  ADATs  must  be  comprised  of  experienced personnel;  provided  adequate  communications, transport,  and  protective equipment; and trained on airfield damage assessment procedures. In addition, a pavement  reference  marking  system  (PRMS),  used  to  assist  in  identifying locations of damage and UXO on the runway, must be employed if the airfield damage assessment process is to be within required accuracy. The military grid reference  system  (MGRS)  is  used  when  reporting  damages  on  airfield pavements not on the takeoff and landing surface.  1.2.1. Airfield damage assessment is the critical first  step toward recovering a damaged  airfield.  Since  major  recovery  tasks  cannot  start  until  damage assessment  and  MAOS  selection  are  completed,  speed  and  accuracy  during damage  assessment  are  essential  for  the  success  of  subsequent  rapid  airfield damage repair (RADR) activities.  1.2.2.  The  MAOS  Selection  Cell  enters  reported  damage  into  the  Geospatial Expeditionary  Planning  Tool  (GeoExPT)  for  automated  MAOS  selection,  or uses the backup legacy method to manually plot damage on maps. The MAOS Selection  Cell  must  consider  damage  to  the  entire  airfield  operating  surfaces including  takeoff  and  landing  surfaces,  access  taxiways  and  aircraft  parking areas, when selecting MAOS candidates. The MAOS Selection Team briefs the MAOS  candidates  by  order  of  preference  to  the  Installation  Commander  or Senior  Airfield  Authority  who  then  selects  the  preferred  MAOS  that  must  be cleared and repaired to launch and recover aircraft.  1.2.3. To shorten airfield recovery time, damage assessment and locating UXO should  be  accomplished  jointly.  Accordingly,  the  damage  assessment  team  is organized  to  locate  and  classify  UXO  and  conduct  ground  assessments  of runway, taxiway, and parking apron pavement. The assessments are conducted either mounted in hardened vehicles or dismounted on foot when damage and/or UXO prevent the use of vehicles.   6                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  Chapter 2 RESOURCES  2.1.  Team  Composition.  An  ADAT  normally  consists  of  one  engineering specialist  (usually  an  engineering  craftsman)  and  two  Explosive  Ordnance Disposal  (EOD)  technicians  (a  CE  member  trained  as  an  EOD  assistant  may substitute for one EOD technician when two are unavailable). Due to the size of a  typical  airfield,  more  than  one  ADAT  is  usually  required  to  meet  the  air tasking order (ATO). The exact number of ADATs is determined by the Base Civil Engineer (BCE). 2.1.1. The engineering craftsman reports location and size of craters, camouflets, spall  fields,  camouflet  fields,  bomblet  fields,  damage  to  airfield  infrastructure such  as  lighting,  arresting  systems,  signage,  underground  utilities,  and  any visible damage to NAVAIDs along their route to the MAOS Selection Cell. 2.1.2.  Explosive  ordnance  technicians  typically  operate  the  armored  vehicle; accurately  locate,  classify,  and  report  UXO;  perform  limited  “render  safe” procedures  on  selected  ordnance;  and  safely  guide  the  team  when  near  UXO. Note: As a general rule, “render safe” procedures are not performed unless two EOD members are present. 2.2.  Equipment.  Equipment  requirements  will  depend  upon  the  assessment technique.  For  example,  dismounted  ADATs  have  different  requirements  than mounted teams. In addition to chemical warfare defense ensembles, each team member  may  require  specific  equipment  to  perform  a  particular  function. Explosive  ordnance  disposal  personnel  should  reference  AFTTP  3-32.5V6, Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  UXO  Operations,  for  EOD  equipment requirements.

Recommend  using  a PRMS  to  assist  with  locating  damage  and  expediting  the  damage  assessment process (Figure 2.1). This reference system should be in place prior to an attack and  be  able  to  withstand  its  effects.  To  achieve  maximum  effectiveness,  the PRMS should be employed on all takeoff and landing (TOL) surfaces. Figure 2.1. Typical Pavement Reference Marking System. 2 2 2 3 2 5 50 100 3  8                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  2.3.1. A zero point is established for each pavement  surface. To eliminate the need  for  time-consuming  measurements,  the  PRMS  provides  a  visual  cue  to locate  damage  and  UXO.  Damage  and  UXO  may  be  located  by  determining how far down the pavement they are from the zero point and how far they are right or left of centerline. These markers are painted on the pavement surface at 50- or 100-foot intervals along the centerline and along the marked runway edge starting at the zero point. Additionally, raised markers (Figure 2.2) are placed at 50- or 100-foot intervals at a distance between 25 to 50 feet from the pavement edge  on  both  sides  of  the  runway.  Spacing  these  markers  from  the  marked runway  edge  helps  ensure  the  reference  system  remains  usable  following  an attack  and  during  recovery  operations.  Normally,  placement  of  these  raised markers  is  accomplished  as  part  of  attack  preparation  and  is  included  on  the engineer  attack  preparation  checklists  in  the  CE  Contingency  Response  Plan (CRP). Three basic rules need to be followed when using the PRMS: Figure 2.2. PRMS Raised Marker.  2.3.1.1.  Zero  Point  Rule.  For  an  airfield  pavement  section,  the  zero  point  is fixed. It does not switch from one end of the pavement to the other. The zero point  is  usually  established  at  the  runway  threshold  where  normal  aircraft operations occur. 2.3.1.2. Centerline Rule. All distances along the length of the pavement section are measured along the centerline from the zero point for that pavement. 2.3.1.3. Right/Left Rule. Right and left of the centerline are determined as the ADAT faces down the centerline of the pavement away from the zero point.  AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         9  2.4. Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). The ADATs use the MGRS to locate damage NOT on the TOL surface.  2.4.1. There is only one rule to remember when reading or reporting MGRS grid coordinates,  always  read  to  the  RIGHT  and  then  UP.  The  first  half  of  the reported set of coordinate digits represents the left-to-right (easting) grid label, and  the  second  half  represents  the  label  as  read  from  the  bottom  to  top (northing). The grid coordinates  may represent the location to the  nearest 10-, 100-,  or  1,000-meter  increment.  The  following  paragraphs  explain  how  to determine grid coordinates of a point on a military map. 2.4.2. A military map has vertical lines (top to bottom) and horizontal lines (left to right). These lines form small squares 1,000 meters on each side called grid squares. The lines that form grid squares are numbered along the outside edge of the map picture. No two grid squares have the same number.  2.4.3. The precision of a point location is shown by the number of digits in the coordinates: the more digits, the more precise the location such as: • • • 1996 – 1,000-meter grid square. 192961 – to the nearest 100 meters. 19269614 – to the nearest 10 meters. 2.4.4. Your address is grid square 1181 on Figure 2.3. To determine this, start from the left and read right until you come to 11, the first half of your address. Then read up to 81, for the other half. Your address is somewhere in grid square 1181. Figure 2.3. Determining a Six-Digit Grid Coordinate.  10                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  2.4.5. Grid square 1181 gives your general neighborhood, but there is a lot of ground  inside  that  grid  square.  To  make  your  address  more  accurate,  just  add another  number  to  the  first  half  and  another  number  to  the  second  half—now your address has six numbers instead of four. 2.4.5.1. To get those extra numbers, pretend that each grid square has ten lines inside  it  running  north  and  south,  and  another  10  running  east  and  west.  This makes 100 smaller squares. You can estimate where these imaginary lines are. 2.4.5.2. Suppose you are halfway between grid line 11 and grid line 12. Then the next number is 5 and the first half of your address is 115. Now suppose you are 3/10 of the way between grid line 81 and grid line 82, which makes the second half of your address 813 (if you were exactly on line 81, the second part would be 810). Your address is now 115813.   AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         11  Chapter 3 AIRFIELD DAMAGE ASSESSMENT PROCESS  3.1.  Introduction.  Airfield  damage  assessment  is  the  critical  first  step  toward restoring  an  operational  runway  after  an  enemy  attack.  Airfield  damage assessment includes evaluation of damage involving runway surfaces, taxiway surfaces,  and  other  facilities  which  directly  support  aircraft  operations.  Speed and accuracy during damage assessment are essential to enable airfield repairs to begin as soon as possible. 3.1.1.  Dedicated  ADATs  determine  location,  types,  and  numbers  of  UXO; location, types, and quantity of airfield pavement damage and report findings to the MAOS Selection Team. The MAOS Selection Team uses this information to select  the  MAOS,  which  must  be  cleared  and  repaired  in  order  to  launch  and recover aircraft.  3.1.2.  This  chapter  provides  guidance  for  accomplishing  airfield  damage assessment  after  attack  operations.  Organization,  team  composition,  and required equipment are described as well as assessment techniques and damage recording and reporting procedures. 3.2. Damage Assessment Phases. Damage assessment planning is based on a two-phased approach: initial reconnaissance and detailed damage assessment.  3.2.1.  Initial  Reconnaissance.  The  purpose  of  initial  reconnaissance  is  to rapidly assess the attack recovery environment by identifying broad areas where airfield pavement was damaged. This initial gross assessment is made from the control tower, manned observation posts, usually splinter protected and elevated to afford clear visibility, around the airfield. From these vantage points, trained personnel  can  quickly  locate  areas  with  UXO  and  pavement  damage  on  the airfield.  Precise  damage  locations  or  measurements  are  not  expected  because most observations are made at some distance from the damaged area. The results of the initial reconnaissance assists the MAOS Selection Cell to quickly direct ADATs to those areas requiring detailed damage assessment, or avoid areas that appear to be too heavily damaged to warrant consideration in MAOS selection. 3.2.1.1. Reporting procedures  will depend upon attack preparation instructions and available communications equipment. Some observers  may report directly to  the  EOC,  while  others  report  to  their  UCC.  For  example,  security  forces observers  may  report  directly  to  the  security  forces  Base  Defense  Operations 12                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  Center  (BDOC),  and  then  relayed  to  the  EOC.  From  these  initial  reports, pavement  areas  showing  promise  as  possible  MAOS  candidates  or  areas  too heavily  damaged  may  become  readily  apparent.  As  a  result,  the  MAOS Selection  Cell  may  adjust  ADAT  routes  to  avoid  severely  damaged  areas  and concentrate on areas that show promise. This adjustment may save valuable time by shortening the ADAT routes. 3.2.1.2.  When  available,  remote  sensing  systems  such  as  tower  mounted cameras or remotely-piloted aircraft (RPA) may be used to get a "snap-shot" of airfield operating surface damage.  3.2.2.  Detailed  Damage  Assessment.  Detailed  damage  assessment  requires precise reporting as this data forms the basis for MAOS selection. Depending on the level of damage, detailed damage assessment may be extremely hazardous and therefore time consuming. 3.2.2.1. Predetermined damage assessment routes and checkpoints are normally identified during attack preparation planning to expedite the assessment process and  prevent  duplication  of  effort  by  the  different  ADATs.  These  routes  are planned to assess airfield priorities as soon as practical. 3.2.2.1.1. ADAT travel routes are normally predetermined to begin at dispersed ADAT  personnel  shelters,  move  to  the  RADR  staging  area,  and  then  travel toward the more critical aircraft pavements. These routes are updated or altered as required based on initial damage assessment reports. Generally, ADAT travel routes proceed to survey the airfield in the priority order identified in Table 3.1. Each installation should develop specific routes suitable for their airfield. Table 3.1. Assessment Priorities. Priority Airfield Location 1 2 3 4 5 6 Takeoff and Landing Surfaces (i.e. runways, alternate launch and recovery surfaces, and taxiway segments long enough to permit aircraft launch and recovery) Access pavements to takeoff and landing surfaces Aircraft parking areas Infrastructure such as lighting (including Precision Approach Path Indicators [PAPIs], utility lines, signage, etc.) Aircraft arresting systems Aircraft rearming and refueling areas AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         13  7 Other specified locations as defined in the Facility Prioritization List or as determined by installation leadership 3.2.2.1.2. Predetermined routes may be altered as initial reconnaissance reports are received and analyzed.  When applicable, the EOC  notifies  ADATs of any changes  to  predetermined  routes,  including  new  checkpoints  and  special instructions necessary to complete their assessment route. 3.2.2.1.3. Upon declaration or ALARM BLACK, Initial Release, ESF 3/5 within the  EOC  will  inform  the  ADATs  to  begin  their  routes  from  their  dispersed sheltered locations. The ADATs report the extent and location of damage along their  predetermined  or  modified  routes,  including  damage  on  the  route  from their shelter to the airfield.  3.2.2.2. Techniques. Detailed damage assessment may be conducted using one of two possible techniques—mounted (vehicular) or dismounted (on foot).  3.2.2.2.1.  Mounted.  The  mounted  technique  provides  the  most  speed  and protection for the ADAT and is the primary detailed reconnaissance technique. The  ADAT  composition  for  the  mounted  assessment  may  vary  with  vehicle capacity, but should generally be the same as the team composition discussed in paragraph 2.1. Ideally, armored vehicles are used to transport ADATs between UXO  and  pavement  damage  while  providing  protection  from  UXO  blast  and fragmentation  effects;  however,  these  benefits  are  not  provided  without  some cost to effectiveness, visibility from inside the vehicle is restricted by the armor protection.  This  limitation  may  contribute  to  errors  in  reporting  the  size, position,  and  identification  of  UXO  and  damage.  Field  tests  have  proven  that with practice damage assessment teams can estimate short distances (less than 100  feet)  and  crater  diameters  with  acceptable  accuracy  without  manual measurements, and estimate spall, camouflet and bomblet numbers within fields without precise counting. The accuracy of this method will vary from person to person. Observation distance, weather conditions, time of observation (night or day), and other human factors such as fatigue and fear will affect accuracy. 3.2.2.2.1.1.  Armored  vehicles,  such  as the  up-armored  high  mobility multipurpose  wheeled  vehicle  (UAH)  shown  in  Figure  3.1,  provide  increased protection from explosive hazards in the UXO-laden environment. If an armored vehicle is  not available, substitute  with hardened dump trucks or other  heavy-duty vehicles.    14                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  Figure 3.1. UAH.  3.2.2.2.1.2.  Armored  vehicles  offer  varying  degrees  of  protection  from  UXO. Armored crews can reduce their risk from some but not all UXO threat areas by remaining  mounted.  When  conducting  risk  assessment,  type  and  size  of  the potential UXO must be considered. Although some UXO may only immobilize vehicles, others may result in catastrophic injury. 3.2.2.2.1.3.  Personnel  in  non-armored  vehicles  face  nearly  the  same  risk  from UXO  as  dismounted  forces  because  the  protection  afforded  by  non-armored vehicles is negligible. The non-armored vehicles are also vulnerable to damage or destruction from UXO. 3.2.2.2.1.4. The best travel route will normally be along the pavement centerline. This route gives equal visibility to both sides of the runway and allows ADAT personnel  to  visually  sweep  the  area  in  front  and  to  the  sides  of  the  vehicle. Obviously,  a  meandering  path  may  be  required  to  avoid  UXO  or  pavement damage.  When  straying  from  the  centerline  is  necessary,  the  team  must  be careful  not  to  miss  damage  or  UXO  on  the  far  side  of  the  runway.  Team members  should  remain  in  the  vehicle  for  protection  from  explosive  hazards except  in  extreme  cases  where  not  dismounting  would  seriously  hamper  the assessment effort.  3.2.2.2.1.5. When a large UXO is encountered, the damage assessment vehicle should approach on the far runway shoulder as shown in Figure 3.2. The ADAT will  then  stop,  record  and  immediately  report  as  much  of  the  following information  as  possible:  location,  shape,  color,  markings,  fuze  type  and condition, coordinates, and estimated time to render-safe.  Warning: Make radio transmissions from a minimum safe distance of a UXO threat of 25 feet for handheld or 100 feet for vehicle mounted radios. UXO are AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         15  highly  susceptible  to  electromagnetic  radiation  (EMR)  and  may  explode.  This could come from communication and other transmitting devices. Warning: Do  not  move or remove anything on or  near a UXO. UXO can be extremely  sensitive  and  can  cause  serious  injury  or  death  if  disturbed  in  any way. If a sub-munition is found there may be many more sub-munitions in the same area. Small size does not diminish the danger of sub-munitions. Figure 3.2. Single Large UXO Assessment.  3.2.2.2.1.6.  When  the  ADAT  sights  a  bomblet  (Figure  3.3),  or  bomblet  field, they should approach the closest ordnance (Figure 3.4) at a safe distance and record  the  following  information:  number,  shape,  location,  field  width,  field length, color, markings, fuze type and condition, and render-safe time. After this information  is  reported  to  the  EOC,  the  ADAT  should  drive  past  the  field  in such  a  manner  as  to  provide  the  maximum  standoff  distance  between  the bomblet field boundaries and the ADAT vehicle. Figure 3.3. Bomblet Examples.  16                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  Figure 3.4. Bomblet Field Assessment.  3.2.2.2.1.7. Crater. Craters are generally divided into two broad categories: large or small. Large craters are greater than 20 feet in diameter and small craters are 20  feet  in  diameter  or  less  (Figure  3.5).  In  either  case,  approach  craters  with caution. If the surrounding area appears free of UXO, move as close to the crater as  possible  to  assess  the  damage  and  to  determine  if  a  UXO  is  in  the  crater. Record coordinates for the center of each crater and its apparent diameter. 3.2.2.2.1.8.  Crater  Field.  Small  craters  located  close  together  (less  than  two feet),  where  their  pavement  upheaval  joins  the  neighboring  crater,  should  be reported as a crater field, or mix of a field and individual craters. The decision of which  method to use  must reflect the balance between speed (calling in  many grouped  small  craters  individually  will  use  a  lot  of  time  and  tie-up  radio frequencies) and accuracy of  the picture for the EOC and  Crisis  Action Team (CAT);  if  the  field  is  too  broad  or  spread  out,  it  will  not  give  the  MAOS Selection  Cell  enough  information  to  make  an  appropriate  MAOS  selection. Crater fields are similar to bomb craters and should be carefully examined from a distance  for the presence of UXO. If  no UXO is sighted, the  ADAT should move  the  vehicle  into  the  area  and  record  the  following  information:  center coordinates for the leading and trailing edges, leading and trailing field widths, and number of craters within the field. Be sure to report any UXO or spalls in the  field  as  well.  Provide  the  MAOS  plotters  with  as  much  of  a  picture  as possible; for instance, if the field is 100 feet wide, but 80% of the craters are in the left-of-center 50 foot section, say so in your report.   AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         17  Figure 3.5. Large and Small Crater Profiles.  3.2.2.2.1.9.  Camouflets.  As  related  to  RADR,  a  camouflet  is  created  when  a munition  punctures  the  pavement  surface  and  bursts  underground,  creating  a cavity with little to no surface rupturing (Figure 3.6). Camouflets are considered to  be  a  type  of  small  crater.  When  camouflets  are  present  the  ADAT  should approach  the  area  with  caution.  If  the  surrounding  area  appears  free  of  UXO, move  just  close  enough  to  the  camouflet  to  assess  the  damage.  Record  its coordinates and entry-hole size and report the camouflet to the MAOS Selection Cell. Additionally, estimate the cavity size according to nearby craters (e.g., if the closest craters to the camouflet are 5-foot in diameter, the cavity size would be  estimated  to  be  5-ft).  Note:  It  may  be  possible  to  find  camouflet  fields, especially when an enemy uses flechette munitions. Figure 3.6. Camouflet in Concrete Surface.  3.2.2.2.1.10. Spall Fields. A  spall is pavement damage that does not penetrate through the pavement surface to the underlying soil layers. A spall’s damaged area could be up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in diameter. The same as bomb craters, spall fields (Figure 3.7) should be carefully examined  from a distance for the presence  of  UXO.  If  no  UXO  is  sighted,  the  ADAT  should  move  the  vehicle 18                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  into  the  area  and  record  the  following  information:  center  coordinates  for  the leading  and  trailing  edges,  leading  and  trailing  field  widths,  and  number  of spalls within the field. Because spalls are not highly visible even at close range, spall counts and field dimensions may be difficult to determine, especially since spalls are likely to be covered with debris. Figure 3.7. Spall Field.  3.2.2.2.1.11.  Multiple  Ordnance/Damage  Sites.  It  is  possible  an  ADAT  will encounter  a  situation  where  damage  and  UXO  presence  are  so  severe  that continuation of the planned assessment route is impossible. Before attempting to reach the other side of the blocked area, the ADAT should inform the MAOS Selection Cell of the situation. The selection cell may see a pattern developing based on the damage reported, which allows adjustment of travel routes to have a different ADAT finish assessing the planned route (Figure 3.8). In this type of situation, both ADATs would assess damage from their respective sides of the blockage and report their findings to the MAOS Selection Cell.  Figure 3.8. Multiple UXO/Damage Assessment.  AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         19  3.2.2.2.2. Dismounted. Dismounted damage assessment is a slow and hazardous technique that requires the runway and taxiway surfaces to be surveyed on foot. Although  the  dismounted  technique  is  the  most  accurate  damage  assessment method, it is extremely time consuming and exposes ADAT members to UXO fragmentation  and  blast  hazards.  Damage  assessment  team  members  walk specified  areas  of  the  runway  to  identify  and  locate  UXO,  pavement  damage, and  damage  to  support  systems.  Make  distance  measurements  by  visual estimation  using  the  PRMS  or  pacing,  whichever  is  most  appropriate  for  the situation. In addition, the team should specify if there is adequate pavement for taxing  aircraft  around  taxiway  damage  so  repairs  can  be  delayed  until  a  more opportune  time.  Actions  of  the  individual  team  members  are  outlined  in  the following paragraphs. 3.2.2.2.2.1. Dismounted forces face the greatest risk from UXO. To reduce this risk,  dismounted  forces  need  to  be  able  to  identify  UXO  threats  correctly, understand procedures for avoiding and reporting these threats, and be aware of UXO threat areas previously reported. 3.2.2.2.2.2.  The  senior  EOD  technician  is  responsible  for  safe  travel  routes through  hazardous  areas.  The  EOD  member  assigns  areas  or  lanes  of responsibility to each of the team members. As the team progresses through its area of responsibility, the EOD representative assists in the proper classification of UXO and relays pertinent information to the MAOS Selection Team. 3.2.2.2.2.3.  The  engineering  team  member  has  the  overall  responsibility  for damage  assessment.  The  engineering  craftsman  may  be  assisted  in  damage location and recording by one or more augmentees.  3.2.2.2.2.4.  Team  members  are  responsible  for  following  the  safe  routes identified by the senior EOD member and identifying all pavement damage and UXO locations in the assigned area. Any identification problems are reported to the  EOD  or  engineering  representative  for  resolution.  Augmentees  may  also assist If communication  difficulties  are  experienced,  the  augmentees  are  usually  called upon to serve as runners. 3.3. Summary. Airfield damage assessment teams, directed by the EOC, assess airfield pavement damage so repair teams can repair the minimum operational airfield surfaces as quickly as possible. If effective airfield damage assessments are  to  be  realized,  ADATs  must  be  comprised  of  experienced  personnel;  be provided adequate communications, transport, and protective equipment; and be the  MAOS  Selection  Cell. transmitting in information to 20                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  completely  knowledgeable  of  damage  assessment  procedures.  In  addition,  a pavement  reference  marking  system,  used  to  identify  the  locations  of  damage and  UXO  on  airfield  pavements,  must  be  employed  if  the  airfield  damage assessment  process  is  to  be  within  the  required  accuracy.  The  success  of subsequent  RADR  activities  to  a  large  degree  hinge  upon  the  accuracy  of  the airfield damage assessment efforts.  AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         21  Chapter 4 RECORDING AND REPORTING DAMAGE  4.1. Damage Assessment Data. During damage assessment, ADATs gather two types  of  information—location  and  details  of  pavement  damage  caused  by bombs, rockets, etc., and UXO data. The following damage information should be  included  in  each  report:  damage  type  (crater;  UXO;  camouflet;  spall, camouflet or bomblet field, etc.); location (by PMRS for runways or MGRS for areas other than the runway); size (crater diameter; crater, camouflet, spall, or bomblet  field  dimensions;  etc.);  and  number  (of  craters,  spalls,  camouflets  or bomblets in a field). Unexploded explosive ordnance must be accurately located, classified, and immediately reported in sufficient detail to the EOD supervisor within the EOC to determine risk to aircraft operations. Immediate reporting not only aids in hastening the MAOS selection process but also serves to keep the ESFs 3/5 and MAOS Selection Cell aware of the team’s position on a frequent basis. Include the following information in the UXO report: location, quantity, size, shape, color, distinctive markings, and fuze type and condition. All UXO within 300 feet of repair operations or aircraft operating surfaces (marked edges of  runways  and  taxiways)  must  be  identified  and  reported  (and  any  obvious visible hazard at a greater distance that may threaten RADR operations). Entry holes for subsurface UXO and camouflets must also be reported. 4.2.  Recording  and  Reporting  Damage.  As  damage  is  assessed,  it  must  be recorded and immediately reported to the EOC for damage plotting and MAOS selection. The speed of reporting depends upon the complete understanding of the  information  being  relayed  and  strict  adherence  to  radio  discipline  by  both MAOS Selection Cell and ADAT personnel. A written list of reported damage should  be  kept  by  each  ADAT  and  provided  to  the MAOS  Selection  Cell  for verification purposes upon their return. Each damage item is recorded as shown in  Figure  A2.1  and  reported  as  a  series  of  letters  and  numbers.  An  example airfield  damage  reporting  form  for  copying  may  be  found  in  Figure  A2.2. Figure  4.1  provides  an  example  of  how  the  MAOS  Selection  Cell  plots  the damages. 4.2.1. Damage Type or UXO. Enter damage or ordnance type here, using a letter coding of “C” for crater, “X” for UXO, “S” for spall, “B” for bomblet, and “M” for camouflet.  4.2.2. Location. Distance from the zero pavement reference point to the center of 22                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  the crater, camouflet, UXO, or to the closest leading edge of the spall, camouflet or bomblet field. Figure 4.1. Data Report and Plot of Damage.  4.2.3. Left or Right of Centerline. “L” stands for left, “R” stands for right. They denote  the  direction  from  the  pavement  centerline  to  the  damage/UXO  center point. 4.2.4. Distance from Centerline. Distance from the centerline to the center of the crater,  UXO,  camouflet,  or  to  the  center  of  the  leading  edge  of  the  spall, camouflet or bomblet field. 4.2.5.  Diameter  /  Width.  For  craters  or  circular  spall,  camouflet  and  bomblet fields,  enter  the  letter  “D.”  For  rectangular  spall,  camouflet  or  bomblet  fields, enter the letter “W.” 4.2.6.  Size  of  Diameter  or  Width.  This  is  the  numerical  estimation  of  the apparent diameter or field width for that point along the pavement. 4.2.7. Field Identifier (F). If required, enter the letter “F” to alert the EOC the following information completes the leading edge description of a spall, small crater,  camouflet,  or  bomblet  field.  The  next  alphanumeric  group  after  “F” stands for the same as above and describes the trailing edge of the field. AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         23  4.2.8. Number Identifier (N). The letter “N” alerts the EOC the field identifier is completed  and  the  next  number  is  the  number  of  spalls,  small  craters, camouflets, bomblets, or a mix. 4.2.9. Number of Bomblets, Small Craters, Camouflets or Spalls. The numerical estimate  of  the  number  of  bomblets,  small  craters,  camouflets  or  spalls  in  the field previously identified. If it is a mix, show the total number first followed by the breakdown by type. For instance, if the spall field in Figure 4.1 was a mix of 50  small  craters,  25  spalls,  and  25  UXO;  it  would  be  reported  as: C320R50W40F520L40W60N100(C50X25S25). The first digit (damage type) is determined by the most prominent type of damage (C). 4.2.10.  Description.  Record  additional  information  here  to  help  accurately identify pavement damage or describe the UXO.  4.3.  Communications.  The  success  of  the  damage  assessment  operation depends  upon  dedicated  communication  instruments  and  strict  communication procedures to ensure accurate transmission of damage information. The current concept  calls  for  separate  EOD  and  CE  radio  nets  for  transmission  of  this information. The EOD and CE representative on each ADAT will transmit UXO and damage information to the EOC.  4.3.1. With multiple ADATs passing information to the control center, as well as other  CE  and  EOD  personnel  around  the  base,  the  potential  for  confusion  is great.  It  is  essential  to  use  clear  and  concise  radio  transmissions  while maintaining strict radio discipline. Unnecessarily keying the mike, transmitting unorganized thoughts, and interrupting other transmissions  will  necessitate the repeat of transmissions, which results in the delay of MAOS selection and repair operations.  4.3.2. Radio communications are usually quick and generally effective, but can be  jammed  or  intercepted  if  not  secured.  If  secure  communications  are unavailable,  procedures,  such  as  a  runner  system,  should  be  preplanned  to address  these  problems.  Use  locally-developed  “comm-out”  procedures  when necessary.     JOHN B.

Typically  the  route  will  meander  to  avoid  damage.  The  time  to clear or repair the access route is a consideration in MAOS selection. The terms “transition path, taxiway, and transition route” are sometimes used to indicate an access route on a launch/recovery surface. Actual crater diameter—The actual crater diameter is the diameter across the crater after the heaved pavement has been removed; in other words, the actual size of the required repair, in most cases is significantly larger than the apparent diameter. Airfield—An  area  prepared  for  the  accommodation  (including  any  buildings, installations, and equipment), landing, and takeoff of aircraft. Air  tasking  order  (ATO)—A  method  used  to  task  and  disseminate  to components,  subordinate  units,  and  command  and  control  agencies  projected sorties,  capabilities  and/or  forces  to  targets  and  specific  missions.  Normally provides specific instructions to include call signs, targets, controlling agencies, etc., as well as general instructions. Source: JP 3-30. Airfield  damage  assessment—Locating,  classifying,  and  measuring damage (camouflet, crater, spall, and UXO) on the airfield operating surfaces. Airfield  Damage  Assessment  Team  (ADAT)—An  airfield  recovery  team, typically located in or near the EOC and directed by the ESF 3, used to identify and locate airfield damage and UXO following an attack. Their initial efforts are normally  targeted  towards  the  airfield  proper;  but  can  also  be  employed elsewhere as deemed necessary. The ADAT usually consists of one engineering technician and two EOD technicians. A CE member trained as an EOD assistant may replace one of the EOD technicians when two are unavailable for ADAT. The  ADAT  should  be  equipped  with  an  armored  vehicle  and  communications enabling  them  to  report  their  observations  to  the  MAOS  Selection  Cell.  The ADAT damage reports must be accurate as this information is used in MAOS selection. the AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         27  Alarm  black—An  alert  condition  signifying  the  attack  is  over,  but  chemical agent contamination is possible. Personnel are cleared to leave shelters, but must wear chemical protective ensembles. Apparent crater diameter—The visible diameter of the crater, inside edge to inside edge, at the original surface level prior to debris being removed. In actual practice, this can be measured from pavement edge to pavement edge. Apparent diameter  is  the  information  forwarded  to  the  MAOS  Selection  Cell  by  the ADATs. Apron/ramp—A defined area on an airfield intended to accommodate aircraft for the purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance. Bomblet field—A cluster of sub-munitions within a defined area. Camouflet—Craters  with  relatively  small  apparent  diameters,  but  deep penetration and subsurface voids created by the munition puncturing through the pavement  surface  and  exploding  in  the  base  material.  Note:  Munitions  that penetrate the surface but do not explode are also treated as a camouflets. Camouflet field—A cluster of spalls within a defined area. Crater—The pit, depression, or cavity formed in the surface of the earth by an explosion. It may range from saucer-shaped to conical, depending largely on the depth of burst. Crater field—A cluster of small craters (less than two  feet apart) where their upheaval joins the neighboring crater within a defined area. Damage assessment—1. The determination of the effects that attacks have on targets.  2.  (DOD  only)  A  determination  of  the  effect  of  a  compromise  of classified  information  on  national  security.  3.  (AF/CE)  The  process  of identifying and locating damage and unexploded ordnance following an attack. Damage  assessment  activities  generally  are  separated  into  two  categories: airfield pavements and facility/utility. Dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability. Emergency Operations Center—A temporary or permanent facility where the coordination  of  information  and  resources  to  support  domestic  incident management activities normally takes place. 28                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  Explosive hazard—Any hazard containing an explosive component to include unexploded  explosive  ordnance  (including  land  mines),  booby  traps  (some booby  traps  are  nonexplosive),  improvised  explosive  devices  (which  are  an improvised  type  of  booby  trap),  captured  enemy  ammunition,  and  bulk explosives. Explosive  ordnance—All  munitions  containing  explosives,  nuclear  fission  or fusion materials, and biological and chemical agents. Explosive  ordnance  disposal  (EOD)—The  detection,  identification,  on-site evaluation, rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include explosive ordnance which has become hazardous by damage or deterioration. Initial reconnaissance—The initial, long-range damage assessment conducted from  observation  posts,  control  towers,  airbase  point  defense  positions,  and other airfield vantage points. MAOS  selection—The  process  of  plotting  damage  and  UXO  locations  on  an airbase  runway  map  and  using  this  information  to  select  a  portion  of  the damaged  runway  which  can  be  repaired  most  quickly  to  support  aircraft operations. Minimum  airfield  operating  surface  (MAOS)—The  combined  requirement for airfield surfaces for both runway and access routes. For example, the MOS is part of the MAOS. Minimum  operating  strip  (MOS)—1.  A  runway  which  meets  the  minimum requirements  for  operating  assigned  and/or  allocated  aircraft  types  on  a particular  airfield  at  maximum  or  combat  gross  weight.  2.  The  MOS  is  the smallest  amount  of  area  to  be  repaired  to  launch  and  recover  aircraft  after  an attack.  Selection  of  this  MOS  will  depend  upon  mission  requirements,  taxi access, resources available, and estimated time to repair. For fighter aircraft, the typically accepted dimensions are 5,000 feet long by 50 feet wide. Ordnance—Explosives,  chemicals,  pyrotechnics,  and  similar  stores,  e.g., bombs, guns and ammunition, flares, smoke, or napalm. Pavement  upheaval—The  vertical  displacement  of  the  airfield  pavement around  the  edge  of  an  explosion-produced  crater.  The  pavement  upheaval  is within the crater damage diameter, but is outside the apparent crater diameter. In other  words,  it  is  that  part  of  the  pavement  out  of  “flush”  tolerance  which  is AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016                                                                         29  elevated above the adjacent undamaged surface. Personnel—Those individuals required in either a military or civilian capacity to accomplish the assigned mission. Procedures—Standard,  detailed  steps  that  prescribe  how  to  perform  specific tasks. Ramp—see “apron.” Rapid Airfield Damage Assessment System (RADAS)—A remotely operated system to rapidly assesses airfield damage and UXO after an attack and provides data  necessary  to  rapidly  repair  the  airfield  to  meet  Combatant  Commander ATO requirements. RED HORSE—Air Force units wartime-structured to provide a heavy engineer capability  that  are  mobile,  rapidly  deployable,  and  largely  self-sufficient  for limited periods of time. Reconnaissance—A  mission  undertaken  to  obtain,  by  visual  observation  or other  detection  methods,  information  about  the  activities  and  resources  of  an enemy  or  adversary,  or  to  secure  data  concerning  the  meteorological, hydrographic, or geographic characteristics of a particular area. Render  safe  procedures—The  portion  of  the  explosive  ordnance  disposal procedures  involving  the  application  of  special  explosive  ordnance  disposal methods and tools to provide for the interruption of functions or separation of essential  components  of  unexploded  explosive  ordnance to  prevent  an unacceptable detonation. Runway—A  defined  rectangular  area  of  an  airfield,  prepared  for  the  landing and takeoff run of aircraft along its length. A runway is measured from the outer edge of the thresholds from one end of the runway to the others. The width of the  runway  is  typically  measured  from  the  outer  edge  of  the  load-bearing pavement  on  one  side  to  the  outer  edge  of  the  load-bearing  pavement  on  the other side. In some cases the runway may be measured from the outside edge of the runway marking line on one side to the outside edge of the marking line on the other side and any remaining load bearing pavement is considered shoulder. Safing—As applied to weapons and ammunition, the changing from a state of readiness for initiation to a safe condtion. Spall—Pavement damage that does not penetrate through the pavement surface 30                             AFTTP 3-32.11   1 FEBRUARY 2016  to the underlying soil layers. A spall damage area could be up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) in diameter. Spall field—A cluster of spalls within a defined area.
