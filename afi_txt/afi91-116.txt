Nuclear weapons shall not be intentionally exposed to abnormal environments except in an emergency. (T-0) 4.4.  Nuclear  weapons  shall  not  be  used  for  training  or  for  troubleshooting  (i.e.,  to  confirm the existence of a fault, aid in fault isolation, or verify that a fault has been corrected except as explicitly allowed by a specific safety rule). (T-0) 4.5.  Nuclear  weapons  may  be  used  for  exercises  except  when  explicitly  prohibited  by specific safety rules. (T-0) 4.6.  Only  certified  procedures,  personnel,  equipment,  facilities,  and  organizations, authorized  by  the  appropriate  level  of  authority,  shall  be  employed  to  conduct  nuclear weapon system operations. (T-0) 4.7.  The  total  number  of  personnel  performing  nuclear  weapon  system  operations  shall  be held to the minimum consistent with the operations performed. (T-0) 4.8.  At  least  two  authorized  persons  must  be  present  during  any  operation  with  a  nuclear weapon, except when authorized by a specific safety rule; i.e., alert fly. They must be able to detect incorrect or unauthorized procedures in the task being performed. They must also have knowledge of and understand applicable safety and security requirements. (T-0) 4.9.  Personnel  that  have  physical  access  to  nuclear  weapons  must  be  qualified  under  the PRP,  in  accordance  with  DoD  Instruction  5210.42,  Nuclear  Weapon  Personnel  Reliability Program (PRP). (T-0) 4.10.  Physical  security  will  be  maintained,  in  accordance  with  DoDD  5210.41,  Security Policy for Protecting Nuclear Weapons. (T-0) the  Combatant 4.10.1.  Nuclear  weapons  will  be  transported  as  determined  by Commander  or  the  Military  Department,  in  accordance  with  DoD  Instruction  4540.05, DoD  Transportation  of  U.S.  Nuclear  Weapons.  Additionally,  the  following  safety guidance applies: 4.10.2.  Movement(s)  will  be  kept requirements. (T-0) to  a  minimum  consistent  with  operational 4.10.3.

(T-0) 4 AFI91-116  8 DECEMBER 2015 4.13.  Deviations from safety rules are permitted in an emergency, except as follows: (T-0) 4.13.1.  U.S. custody must be maintained until receipt of a valid nuclear control order that permits transferring U.S. nuclear weapons to non-U.S. delivery forces. (T-0) 4.13.2.  Nuclear  weapons  shall  not  be  expended  unless  a  valid,  properly  authenticated nuclear control order conveying release or expenditure authority is received. (T-0) 5.  Specific Guidance. 5.1.
