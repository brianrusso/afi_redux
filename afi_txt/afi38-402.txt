Measure Savings.  (T-2). 3.8.6.1.  Monetary  savings  are  calculated  and  reported  based  on  first-year  savings.  Exceptions  may  be  made  in  cases  where  an  improvement  with  a  high  implementation cost  yields measurable savings continuing more than one  year.   If implementation  costs exceed 50 percent of first-year savings, calculations are based on average annual savings over a period of up to five years or the lifecycle of the improvement, whichever is less. 3.8.6.2.  For  ideas  proposing  an  option(s)  to  satisfy  a  new  mission  requirement,  do  not use the cost difference between options to calculate/validate dollar savings. 3.8.6.3.  Man-hour  savings  (even  when  associated  with  depot  repair)  may  not  be considered  in  calculation  of  dollar  savings.    The  only  two  exceptions  are:    (1)  a documented elimination of a manpower authorization (funded through the Future  Years Defense  Plan)  from  the  Unit  Manpower  Document,  and  (2)  elimination  of  documented overtime.    In  those  instances,  the  reductions  are  directly  attributed  to  the  suggested improvement.  Eliminated manpower positions are returned to the owning MAJCOM to be redistributed to higher priority workload that has been recognized, but not funded (an unfunded manpower position).  In those cases, use AFI 65-503, US  Air Force Cost  and Planning  Factors,  to  determine  the  annual  cost  of  the  manpower  authorization  and  use that cost figure in savings calculation. 3.9.  Servicing Manpower Office will: 3.9.1.  Use  CPI  techniques,  as  needed,  for  idea  submissions  identified  as  problems  versus implementable  ideas  (dialogue  with  commander/director  regarding  workload  priorities  may be warranted). 3.9.2.  As requested, assist submitters with documentation of process improvement ideas, to ensure current method (current state), proposed method (future state), expected benefits, and cost of implementation (countermeasures) are fact-based proposals. 3.9.3.  As requested, assists implementers with development of implementation plan. 3.10.  Submitter (any Airman who submits an idea) will: AFI38-402  5 FEBRUARY 2015   9  3.10.1.  Work with a local CPI expert on validating and solving problems when the API Idea Cell determines the idea is a problem without a proposed method.  (T-2). 3.10.2.  As  requested  by  the  API  Idea  Cell,  provide  additional  information,  to  improve  the quality of idea submission prior to evaluation, within 30 calendar days of request. 3.10.3.  As  requested  by  the  evaluator,  provide  additional  information  to  facilitate  the evaluation of the idea by the suspense date established by the evaluator. 3.10.4.  In the case of a group submission, positively identify members of the group in initial idea submission.  Group idea submissions are limited to five individuals.   10  AFI38-402  5 FEBRUARY 2015 Chapter 4 AIRMEN POWERED BY INNOVATION IDEA PROCESS 4.1.  Airmen  Powered  by  Innovation  Idea  Process.  As  depicted  in  figure  4.1,  the  API  Idea Process  is  comprised  of  four  phases:   Ideation/Submission  Phase,  Evaluation  Phase, Implementation Phase, and Hold-the-Gains Phase.  The process is triggered by the submission of an idea from an Airman. Figure 4.1.  High Level API Idea Process Map.  4.2.  Ideation Phase.  During the ideation phase, ideas are generated, reviewed, and improved to ensure  fact  rich ideas are forwarded for evaluation.  Additionally, during the ideation phase an idea  is  reviewed  and  the  submitter  is  afforded  a  quality  assist  by  the  API  Idea  Cell.    The objective  is  to  take  a  “seed”  of  an  idea  and  transform  it  into  a  specific  idea  that  has  sufficient fact-based information to move to the evaluation phase. 4.2.1.  Generating Ideas.  Ideas can be submitted at any time by any Airmen at the following website:    https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/site/API.    Additionally,  ideas  may  be generated through crowdsourcing, a focused effort on a very specific problem or seed of an idea.  This method uses digital communications to leverage the creativity and experience of a large number of Airmen.  This method can be used not only prior to submitting an idea, but also  after  the  API  Idea  Cell  has  returned  the  idea  to  the  submitter  requesting  additional information  to  improve the quality of the idea submission prior to  evaluation.   The method can also be used by an OLDM who has received an idea for evaluation, but determines more information needs to be gathered. 4.2.1.1.  Initial Review.  The API Idea Cell reviews each idea submission and categorizes them in order to select an appropriate response to the submitter. AFI38-402  5 FEBRUARY 2015   11  4.2.1.1.1.  Specific  idea.    The  idea  is  valuable,  practical,  usable,  clearly  articulated, and  ready  to  be  evaluated  with  no  additional  work  necessary.    The  idea  is  ready  to enter the evaluation phase. 4.2.1.1.2.  Seed  idea.    The  idea  is  an  interesting  starter  idea  but  not  ready  for evaluation.    The  idea  enters  the  quality  assist  activity  wherein  the  API  Idea  Cell identifies additional information needed from the submitter prior to forwarding to an OLDM for evaluation. 4.2.1.1.3.  After-the  Fact  Ideas.    An  after-the-fact  idea  is  an  idea  that  has  been presented  formally  or  informally  to  management  prior  to  submission  to  the  API Program.  Management is defined as an individual who has the authority to pursue or give submitter approval to pursue the idea.  The idea needs to be submitted to the API Program within 90 working days of presentation of the idea.  The submission includes the date of presentation and to whom (name, duty title, telephone number, and e-mail address) it was submitted. 4.2.1.1.4.  Commonly  Received  Ideas.    Ideas  that  address  issues  the  Air  Force  is already cognizant of and/or is already addressing is to be closed after initial review.  Even  though  closed  in  the  API  system,  these  ideas  may  be  analyzed  by  the appropriate  headquarters  subject  matter  experts  to  identify  trends  or  improvement opportunities. 4.2.1.1.5.  Ideas Governed by Policy External to the Air Force.  Ideas recommending improvements  beyond  the  authority  of  the  Air  Force  to  approve  and  implement  are closed after initial review.  Even though closed in the API system, these ideas may be analyzed by the appropriate headquarters subject  matter experts to identify trends or improvement opportunities. 4.2.1.1.6.  Non-actionable Ideas (personal complaint, personal attack, venting, etc.)  - Submitter  advised  this  process  is  not  designed  to  respond  to  the  nature  of  the submission. 4.2.1.1.7.  Problem without a proposed solution - Submitter advised to resubmit with a  proposed  solution  and  to  consider  seeking  out  local  CPI  expert  for  assistance,  as needed. 4.2.1.1.8.  Uniform Change Request (UCR) - API cell will forward UCRs to Uniform Board  POC  (AF/A1SR)  to  determine  whether  UCR  is  to  be  presented  to  the  next Uniform  Board.    (T-1).    If  AF/A1SR  determines  the  idea  is  not  going  to  meet  the Uniform Board, they provide disapproval notice and rationale to the API Cell.  If they determine  the  idea  is  going  to  meet  the  Uniform  Board,  API  Cell  will  hold  those UCRs  in  a  database  until  the  next  Uniform  Board,  at  which  time  they  compile  and forward  them  to  AF/A1SR.    After  CSAF  final  decision,  AF/A1SR  will  return  the compiled  list  of  UCRs  to  AFPC  indicating  each  as  approved/disapproved.  SAF/US(M) will accomplish monetary award payment requests for approved UCRs. 4.2.1.1.9.  Patents/Inventions  -  Submitter  advised  that  patents/inventions  are  no longer accepted in the API Idea Process and redirects them to AFI 51-303 Intellectual Property--Patents, Patent Related Matters, Trademarks and Copyrights.   12  AFI38-402  5 FEBRUARY 2015 4.2.1.1.10.  Technical Order (T.O.) Changes - Submissions to make T.O. changes are not  accepted  in  the  API  Program.    Airmen  are  redirected  to  Air  Force  Technical Order Guidance 00-5-1 to submit those types of change requests.  However, after an “improvement-type”  T.O.  change  is  adopted  and  implemented,  Airmen  may  submit the completed AFTO Form 22 along with an excerpt from the published/updated T.O. for consideration in the API Program.  If the idea is a technical order change (already approved  and  implemented)  OLDM  is  the  wing-level  authority  for  the  technical content manager who approved the AFTO  Form  22 proposing the improvement.   In this case, the OLDM is required to:  (1) confirm idea is a true process improvement vice  improvement  to  the  technical  order,  (2)  confirm  results  (dollars/manpower /time/costs to implement) and (3) recommend award.  (T-1). 4.2.1.1.11.  Price Challenge & Verification Program (formerly Zero Overpricing) - Price Challenges, in and of themselves, are not accepted in the API Program.  Airmen are redirected to AFI 23-101 Air Force Materiel Management to submit those types of change requests.  However, after a Price Challenge is adopted and implemented, Airmen may submit the supporting Defense Logistics Agency memorandum detailing the cost savings for consideration in the API Program.  4.2.2.  Outcome.  The outcome of the Ideation Phase is an “evaluate-able” idea that increases the  effectiveness  and/or  efficiency  of  the  Air  Force.    In  other  words,  the  present  method, proposed method, expected benefits, and cost to implement are addressed in the idea. 4.3.  Evaluation Phase. 4.3.1.  Activity.    During  the  evaluation  phase,  the  OLDM  evaluates  the  idea  through validation  of  the  current  method,  proposed  method,  expected  benefits,  and  cost  of implementation. 4.3.2.  Outcome.  There are three potential outcomes of the evaluation phase:  (1) approved or approved in part with intent to implement, (2) approved or approved in part without intent to implement, or (3) disapproved. 4.3.3.  If an idea is approved with intent to implement, it then moves to the implementation phase. 4.3.4.  If an idea is approved without intent to implement, the OLDM must provide rationale and  identify  constraints  to  implementation.    (T-2).    Approved  ideas  without  intent  to implement are reviewed and briefed during the quarterly performance review. 4.3.5.  If  an  idea  is  disapproved,  the  OLDM  must  provide  rationale  or  justification  for  the decision.    (T-2).    Disapproved  ideas  are  reviewed  and  briefed  during  the  quarterly performance review. 4.3.6.  Evaluator disapproves the idea if it is already being considered or is already in use, but not  as  a  result  of  the  idea  submission.    The  API  cell  will  provide  feedback  why  the  idea submission is disapproved via e-mail to the submitter. 4.4.  Implementation Phase. 4.4.1.  Activity.  During the implementation phase, implementation plans are developed and executed. AFI38-402  5 FEBRUARY 2015   13  4.4.2.  Outcome.  There are two potential outcomes of the implementation phase:  (1) the idea is fully implemented and results can be confirmed or, (2) a deliberate decision is made by the OLDM to suspend/cancel implementation. 4.4.2.1.  If an idea is fully implemented, it moves to the hold-the-gains phase. 4.4.2.2.  If  an  idea  is  suspended  or  canceled,  the  OLDM  must  provide  supporting rationale for the action.  (T-2). 4.5.  Hold-the-Gains Phase. 4.5.1.  Activity.    During  the  hold-the-gains  phase,  the  OLDM  confirms  results  and  where practical,  sets  a  new  standard  of  performance  and  measurement.    The  API  Cell  will  report confirmed  savings  (manpower  and/or  hard  savings)  to  SAF/US(M)  for  harvesting  through corporate planning, programming, budgeting and execution processes.   14  AFI38-402  5 FEBRUARY 2015 Chapter 5 AWARDS 5.1.  Awards.  The Air Force uses non-monetary and monetary awards to recognize Airmen for successfully implemented ideas.  The maximum monetary award per idea is $10,000.
