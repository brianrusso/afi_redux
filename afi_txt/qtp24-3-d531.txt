However, this procedure is designed to see that any safety device operates correctly as air pressure drops from normal to a low air condition.  For safety purposes, in areas where an incline is present, the operator will use wheel chocks during the air brake check.  The proper procedures for inspecting the air brake system are as follows:  5.2.3.3.1.    With  the  air  pressure  built  up  to  governor  cutoff  (120  –  140  pounds  per square inch (psi)), shut off the engine, chock the wheels if necessary, release the parking brake (all vehicles) and fully apply the foot brake.  Hold the foot brake for one minute.  Check the air gauge to see if the air pressure drops more than three pounds in one minute (single vehicle).  5.2.3.3.2.    Without re-starting the engine, turn electrical power to the “on” or “battery charge” position.  Begin fanning off the air pressure by rapidly applying and releasing the foot brake.  Low air warning devices (buzzer, light, flag) should activate before air pressure drops below 60 psi or level specified by the manufacturer.  5.2.3.3.3.    Continue to fan off the air pressure.  On single vehicle types, the parking brake valve should close (pop-out).  5.2.3.4.  Sign  AF  Form  1800.    Verify  Standard  Form  (SF)  91,  Motor  Vehicle  Accident Report and Department of Defense (DD) Form 518, Accident Identification Card are on-hand.  5.2.3.5.  Post-operation inspection.  5.2.3.5.1.    Check fuel level (< ¾ tank, refuel).  5.2.3.5.2.    Check diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) level (< ¾ tank, refill).  5.2.3.5.3.    Ensure vehicle and components are cleaned.      5.2.3.5.4.    Park vehicle.  Ensure transmission in neutral, apply parking brake. 5.2.3.5.5.    Follow manufacturer’s shut-down procedures. 5.2.3.5.6.    Shut off lights and accessories. 5.2.3.5.7.    Drain air tanks. 5.2.3.5.8.    Post 360 walk-around.  Check for leaks and damage.  5.3.

The following are safety items and procedures to be followed  during  dump  truck  operations.    The  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  will  also provide  safe  operating  procedures  and  the  vehicle  itself  may  have  warnings,  cautions  and danger stickers that the vehicle operator should be aware of.  5.4.2.  Vehicle  data  plate.    Be  familiar  with  the  location  and  information  found  on  the  data plate.  5.4.3.  Plan the route.  5.4.3.1.  Overhead  clearance.    Check  the  clearance  height  of  the  vehicle  relative  to  the overhead obstructions such as power lines, trees, and bridges.  5.4.3.2.  Width restrictions/construction zones, over-the-road.  5.4.3.3.  Weight restriction (roads, bridges, off-road conditions).  5.4.3.4.  Inclines.  5.4.3.5.  Uneven ground.  5.4.3.6.  Soft surfaces.  5.4.4.  Over the road operation.  5.4.4.1.  Greater vehicle weight.  The operator needs to consider the combined weight of the dump truck and the load.  This will affect the following:  5.4.4.1.1.    Operator’s ability to stop.  Do not tailgate the vehicle in front.  Allow more distance between vehicles in order to increase reaction time.  5.4.4.1.2.    Vehicle’s  ability  to  accelerate/follow  the  flow  of  traffic.    Accelerate smoothly  and  gradually  so  the  truck  does  not  jerk.    Rough  acceleration  causes unnecessary, premature mechanical damage to the truck’s drive train.  Maintain a safe speed (typically 5 miles per hour (mph) below the posted speed limit).  5.4.4.2.  Downgrades/upgrades.    The  operator  will  use  lower  gears  more  frequently  to climb hills or mountains with increasing grade steepness, length and/or heavy load weight.  Plan ahead to identify downgrades/upgrades on the route of travel.  If possible, talk to other drivers  who  are  familiar  with  the  grades  to  find  out  what  speeds  are  safe.    When encountering downgrades/upgrades as described, the operator will need to address:  5.4.4.2.1.    Speed.  On downgrades, gravity causes the speed of the vehicle to increase.  The operator must select an appropriate safe speed, use a low gear, and proper braking techniques.  The operator must go slow enough so as to not overheat the truck brakes.  5.4.4.2.2.    Stopping.    If  the  brakes  become  too  hot,  they  may  start  to  “fade”.    This means the operator will need to apply the brakes harder and harder to acquire equivalent stopping power.  5.4.4.3.  Sharp turns.  Slow down before entering the turn.  During the turn, avoid sharp sudden movements with the steering wheel.  This reduces the chance of shifting the load in  the tank, and also  prevents  the possibility of tipping over due to  the higher center of gravity.  5.4.4.4.  Surroundings.  Operating an dump truck requires the operator’s constant attention.  Many  situations  can  be  avoided  by  simply  paying  close  attention  to  the  surrounding conditions.    Road  signs  such  as  “steep  grade”,  “low  overhead  clearance”,  “sharp  turn ahead”, and special speed limits are posted for the driver’s safety.  5.4.5.  Backing.  5.4.5.1.    Use a spotter and hand signals.  5.4.5.2.    Back slowly and keep the spotter in view at all times.  If the operator loses sight of the spotter, the operator must immediately stop the vehicle.  5.4.5.3.    See  AFMAN  24-306  for  standard  AF  spotter  hand  signals  and  additional guidance on spotter safety.  5.4.6.  Dumping operations.  5.4.6.1.  Always use a spotter while backing.  5.4.6.2.  Look for overhead obstructions.  5.4.6.3.  Be aware of tipping hazards when raising bed/dumping to include, but not limited to:  5.4.6.3.1.    Inclines.  5.4.6.3.2.    Uneven ground.  5.4.6.3.3.    Soft surfaces.  5.4.6.4.    Tailgate  position.    Note:    Tailgate  position  will  depend  on  haul  material  and application.  5.4.6.5.  Lower dump bed/latch tailgate, as required, before leaving the dump site.  5.4.7.  Tailgate  removal.    Refer  to  CBT  on  CE-VLC  Dump  Truck  Tailgate  Removal  and Installation.  5.4.7.1.  Tailgate removal hazards.  5.4.8.  Towing operations.  5.4.8.1.  Proper trailer size for load capacity.  5.4.8.2.  Proper pintle hook/lunette size for trailer/load.  5.4.8.3.  Set safety pin.  5.4.8.4.  Connect air lines, lights, and safety chains.  5.4.8.5.  Secure landing gear.  5.4.8.6.  Always use a spotter.  5.4.8.7.  Trailer will off-track when being pulled.  5.4.9.  Dump truck attachments (if applicable), including, but not limited to:  5.4.9.1.  Snow plow.  5.4.9.2.  Snow broom.  5.4.9.3.  Sander/spreader.  5.4.9.4.  Liquid tank (deicer/water).  5.4.9.5.  Water skid (rapid airfield damage repair (RADR)).  5.4.10.  Tire changing safety.  5.4.10.1.   Consider  where  the  vehicle  is  located.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve,  road  with  no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location.  5.4.10.2.   Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack and jack stand.  5.4.10.3.   Turn on the four-way flashers.  5.4.10.4.   Set parking brake.  5.4.10.5.   Place warning triangles or flares.  5.4.10.6.   Block the wheels.  If changing a front tire, block the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, block the front wheels.  5.4.10.7.   As required, place dunnage or cribbage under the jack and/or jack stand.  CAUTION:    Notify  VCO/VCNCO,  the  supervisor,  and/or  vehicle  maintenance  if  split  rim requires servicing.  5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  General vehicle operation.  5.5.1.1.  Complete a pre-operation vehicle inspection.  5.5.1.2.  Sign the current AF Form 1800.  5.5.1.3.  Climb into the vehicle.  Always use three points-of-contact.  5.5.1.4.  Adjust the seat and mirrors, as needed and fasten seat belt.  5.5.2.  Starting the vehicle.  5.5.2.1.  To start the vehicle, ensure the parking brake is  set and the gear selection is in neutral.  5.5.2.2.  Turn the ignition key to the ON position.  If the vehicle is equipped with a starter button press and release the button once the engines starts.  CAUTION:  Do not engage the starter for more than 10 seconds.  5.5.2.3.

Start the Engine and Check Test for Hydraulic Leaks   o o o o  o o o   o o o o  o o o o o  o Left rear turn signal light and both stop lights clean operating, and proper color (red, yellow, or amber). Get in vehicle. Turn-off lights not needed for driving. Check for all required papers, trip manifests, permits, etc. Secure all loose articles in cab (they might interfere with operation of the controls or hit the operator in a crash). Start the engine. Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. o o o o o o  o  Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes). Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. Cargo, cargo covers.  Lights, etc. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Drivers of trucks and truck tractors when transporting cargo must inspect the securement of the cargo within the first 50 miles of a trip and every 150 miles or every 3 hours (whichever comes first) after. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.  Figure A4.2.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes System.  Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting     o o o o  Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. 7.  Final Air Brake Check  o o o o  o o o o o  o o Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time. If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate.  o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o  o o  psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. o o o o o o Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. o o  Wait for normal air pressure.   Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action.  
