SRDs  are  not  normally  assigned  to items  that  are  already  work  unit  coded  (WUC)  under  established  SRDs.  SRDs  may  be assigned for aircraft blocks or communications-electronics (C-E) versions as required by the program manager. 6.2.  Maintenance  Data  Documentation  (MDD).  With  the  exception  of  engines,  assign SRDs  for  MDD  only  if  the  item  meets  the  requirements  and  rules  for  on-equipment maintenance action documentation IAW Technical Order (T.O.) 00-20-2, Maintenance Data Documentation.  (T-1).    MDD  reportable  end  items  must  have  a  reportable  SRD  as  well  as WUCs  to  document  completed  on-equipment  maintenance  actions.  (T-1).    Do  not  assign individual  SRDs  for  MDD  to  items  that  are  defined  for  off-equipment  maintenance documentation    IAW  T.O.  00-20-2;  instead,  use  the  SRD  for  the  end  item  they  comprise.  . (T-1). 6.3.  Mission  Capability  (MICAP).  Failure  of the  system/equipment  will  prevent performance  of  the  required  mission.  The  types  of  equipment/system  that  fall  in  the categories or requirements for MICAP reporting are: 6.3.1.  Aerospace vehicles and ground launch missiles. (T-1). 6.3.2.  Aerospace engines. (T-1). 6.3.3.  Type  I  aircrew  training  devices  and  direct  mission  support  trainers.    Include ground training aircraft assigned to technical training school units. (T-1). 6.3.4.  C-E,  cryptologic,  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  (ISR),  nuclear command,  control  and  communications  (NC3)  and  photographic  equipment  when AFI23-106  5 MAY 2017 9 uninterrupted  service  is  essential  to  combat  mission,  support  mission  or  task accomplishment. (T-1). 6.3.5.  Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) family of vehicles. (T-1). 6.3.6.  Vehicles  classified  as  support  equipment  (SE)  and  mission  essential  registered vehicles (excluding administratively used, general-purpose vehicles). (T-1). 6.3.7.  SE  that  is  in  direct  support  of  aerospace  vehicles  or  other  MICAP  reportable systems,  when  failure  of  the  SE  will  directly  cause  MICAP  in  the  other  reportable systems. (T-1). 7.  Time  Compliance  Technical  Order system/equipment modifications. (TCTO).  Used for tracking  completion  of 8.  Inventory.  AF visibility of system/equipment is required. 9.  SRD Request Procedures: 9.1.  The  program  manager  (PM)  or  product  group  manager  (PGM)  requests  the  SRD assignment  during  the  acquisition  phase.  The  single  manager  forwards  the  requests  (AF Forms  1230)  to  the  AFMC  Center  SRD  manager/focal  point.  (See  REMIS  web  page  for specific POC.) The AF Form 1230 must be filled in according to the instructions on the back of  the  form.  (T-1).  Submission  of  AF  Form  1230  also  applies  to  significant  equipment modifications or configuration changes that may warrant additional SRD assignments. (T-1) 9.1.1.  The Lead Command program office requests SRD assignment prior to fielding for systems  under  their  purview.  Forward  the  requests  (AF  Forms  1230)  to  the  appropriate MAJCOM/FOA  SRD  manager  who  forwards  the  form  to  the  prime  equipment  SRD manager. (See REMIS web page for specific POC.) The AF Form 1230 must be filled in according  to  the  instructions  on  the  back  of  the  form.  (T-1).  Submission  of  AF  Form 1230  could  also  apply  to  significant  equipment  modifications  or  configuration  changes, which may warrant additional SRD assignments. (T-1) 9.2.  Field  activities  submit  requests  for  SRD  assignment  on  items  not  assigned  during acquisition,  or  for  changes  to  existing  SRD  data  elements,  to  the  owning  MAJCOM/FOA SRD  manager/focal  point  using  data  from  the  equipment  data  plate,  i.e.,  nomenclature, manufacture, model number, and part number. (T-1). 9.2.1.  Upon  approval,  the  owning  MAJCOM/FOA  SRD  manager/focal  point  forwards the request to the appropriate  program office 10.  Assignment and management of SRDs: 10.1.  All requests for new SRDs must meet the requirements cited in paragraph 9. 10.2.  Assign  SRDs  to  selected  equipment  in  the  Air  Force  active  inventory  or  new equipment undergoing acquisition. The first character of the SRD (Attachment 3) identifies a general type of equipment such as "A" for aircraft, "M" for ground-launched missiles, "T" for training equipment, etc. The last two characters of the SRD code are used to identify specific equipment.  They  have  no  other  specific  meaning  but  provide  a  quantity  of  codes  to  draw from when you initially assign the SRD (i.e., "ACH" for C-130E aircraft, "XGN" for T56-7 engines, and "BKP" for AN/GRR-23 radios). 10 AFI23-106  5 MAY 2017 10.3.  Multiple  SRDs  may  be  assigned  for  end-items  having  dual  applications,  such  as  a stand-alone  configuration,  as  well  as  a  component  of  another  system  requiring  cost  data tracking. (e.g. aerospace vehicles with non-interchangeable engine or avionics configurations or engines installed to diverse aerospace vehicles). 10.4.  Location  of  SRD  data.  REMIS  maintains  the  master  table  of  valid  unclassified  AF SRDs,  which  is  transmitted  to  some  interfacing  MISs;  as  they  occur.  Valid  SRDs  for classified  equipment  are  found  in  other  AF  systems  and  publications.  SRD  codes  for Command Mission Equipment (CME) are in the REMIS SRD table. 10.5.  Use  valid  SRDs  to  administer  data  management  in  the  following  MIS  or programs: 10.5.1.  Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS/G099) (T-1). 10.5.2.  Mission Change Data (MCD) (T-1). 10.5.3.  High Priority Mission Support Kit (HPMSK) (T-1). 10.5.4.  Air Force Total Ownership Costs (AFTOC) (T-1). 10.5.5.  Comprehensive Engine Management System (CEMS/D042) (T-1). 10.5.6.  Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS/G105) (T-1). 10.5.7.  CAMS for Mobility (G081). (T-1). 10.5.8.  Special Studies. 10.5.9.  Deficiency  Reports  (DR)  and  Materiel  Improvement  Projects  (MIP)  as maintained in Information Central (INFOCEN/G021). 10.5.10.  Logistics Composite Model (LCOM). 10.5.11.  Readiness Spares Package (RSP). 10.5.12.  Weapon System Management Information System (WSMIS/D087). 10.5.13.  Mission Capability (MICAP) and Awaiting Parts (AWP) (LIMS-EV). 10.5.14.  Air Force Data Services (AFDS). 10.6.  Local levels assign "L" (IMDS) and “Z” ‖ (Supply) prefixed SRDs. These are for local reporting purposes only and will not be reported up-channel from the base. 10.7.  By  accessing  the  SRD  table  directly  through  REMIS,  you  can  also  find  the  Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA) Weapon System  Designator Code  (WSDC) as defined in  AFI  23-101 Air Force  Materiel Management. 11.  Deactivation of an SRD. 11.1.  When  the  equipment  is  no  longer  in  the  AF  inventory  or  no  longer  supported  by AFMC,  the  lead  Command  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the  removal  of  the  SRD  from REMIS and sending a message to applicable field units stating disposition instructions for the end item. 12.  General Responsibility. AFI23-106  5 MAY 2017 11 12.1.  Supply Discipline.  It is the responsibility of all logistics personnel to comply with all written guidance to ensure required repairs, inspections, and documentation are completed in a  compliant,  safe,  timely,  and  effective  manner.    Supervisors  are  responsible  for  enforcing and  establishing  a  climate  that  promotes  maintenance  and  supply  discipline.    Failure  to observe the prohibitions and mandatory provisions in this publication by military members is a  violation  of  Article  92  of  the  UCMJ.  (T-1).    Civilian  personnel  who  violate  punitive publications  may  also  be  subject  to  disciplinary  action.    See  AFI  33-360  for  more  detailed information on the use of punitive language in publications.  JOHN B.
