The CFETP will provide our people with a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of our career field training. The CFETP consists of two parts used by the supervisor to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty. •  Section A provides general information about how the CFETP will be used. •  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression  information,  duties  and  responsibilities, training strategies, and the career field path. •  Section C associates each skill-level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, and training). •  Section D indicates resource constraints. •  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. Part II includes the following: •  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) to include duties, tasks, and technical references to support Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, and correspondence course requirements. •  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards supervisors will use to determine if an Airman has satisfied training requirements. •  Section C identifies available support materials. •  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory and optional courses, and exportable courseware. •  Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM-unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. •  Section F identifies home station training references and courses material required for this specialty in support of contingency/wartime training. Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers. This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs. At the unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this guide. 4              ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED CFETP 3E7X1 C1, 1 January 2017 Advanced Distributive Learning System (ADLS).

Eligibility criteria for award and wear of AF occupational badges can be found in AFI 36-2923 Aeronautical, Duty, and Occupational Badges. B5.2. CE Badge Heraldry. The gear wheel and compass have historically been used to represent the engineering profession, in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents the essence of  engineering:  applying  scientific  principles  and  technology  to  practical  ends.  To  Air  Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that meshes with other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to perform its mission.  The  compass  is  a  precision  tool  historically  used  by  engineers  in  designing  and constructing facilities and equipment. The gear and compass together symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air Force civil engineer. Finally, the wings help to portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components; and that the built environment is the foundation supporting Air Force mission and people. B5.2.1. Basic Badge.  The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of the apprentice course.  B5.2.2. Senior Badge.  The senior badge adds a star to the top of the badge.

This section is reserved.”  PART II SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD A1.  Implementation.  This  STS  will  be  used  for  technical  training  provided  by  AETC  for Apprentice Fire Protection Specialist course. A2.  Purpose.  As  prescribed  in  AFI  36-2201,  this  STS,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  and  in collaboration with the Civil Engineer, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record. The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and qualification training is an application located on the AFCEC-VLC. A2.1. Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and supporting technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. A2.2. Column 2. A2.2.1. (Core Tasks). Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub-column. As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all core and critical tasks for skill level upgrade. A2.2.2. Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment. A2.3. Column 3 (Certification for OJT). Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training  requirements.  Use  the  automated  training  record  application  to  document  individual qualifications.    Task  certification  of  core  and  critical  tasks  require  a  training  start  and completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier. All non-core tasks require training start and completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  Start dates are not required when transcribing tasks. A2.4.  Column  4  (Proficiency  Codes  Used  to  Indicate  Training/Information  Provided). Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements. It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the initial skills training course, correspondence course, and read- ahead material. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for current CDC listings. A2.5. Qualitative Requirements. Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by WBT, resident training and career development courses. 37            CFETP 3E7X1 C1, 1 January 2017 A2.6. Job Qualification Standard (JQS). The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in the automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: A2.6.1. Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training. A2.6.1.1.  Duty  position.  Duty  position  titles  and  task  requirements  for  each  position  will  be developed/identified by the Assistant Chief for Training or section supervisor in the automated training application. Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under trainees Profile I section of the trainee’s automated training record. A2.6.1.2. Duty position change. To change a trainee duty position title select the Profile section under the trainee record and select the new duty position from the dropdown box, entry the date entered new duty position and save the update. Under the trainee JQS section you will see the new tasks associated with the selected duty position. The trainee and trainer/certifier will need to sign off the tasks associated with the new position. A2.6.1.3.  Transcribing  from  previous  versions  to  the  new  CFETP.  Most  items  should transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP. The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core or non-core tasks and add those tasks to their duty positions. A2.6.1.3.1.  Previous  training  certification  not  listed.  If  previous  training  certification  is  not listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button. Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the task(s). The  trainee  will  then  sign  off  the  task(s)  to  finalize  the  transcription  of  previous  training certification. The automated application will place an  entry into the trainee 623a  and must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee. A2.6.1.3.2. Transcribing external training certification. If a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623  III section of the user automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.   If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog. If it is not listed in the master catalog contact the Force Development Manager at AFCEC to have it loaded in the master catalog. A2.6.2.  Documenting  Career  Knowledge.  When  a  certification  course  is  not  available,  the supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). A2.6.2.1. Two-time certification course exam failures. Because firefighter certification courses are part of a national certification system that has been accredited by the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress operated by Oklahoma State University, the waiver authority for two time certification course failures for this career field rests with the AFCFM located at HAF. See AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Table 6.1, note 1 for specific waiver procedures. A2.6.2.2. Certification course waiver packages must be fully justified and be approved by the applicable training and fire protection representatives at the squadron, wing, and MAJCOM levels prior to being forwarded to AFCEC for final approval/disapproval.  See AFI 36-2201, Air 38             CFETP 3E7X1 C1, 1 January 2017 Force Training Program for specific waiver procedures.  For two time certification course exam failures, supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the certification course.   The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier, and receives certification on the STS after successful completion of the task. NOTE:  Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a certification course waiver. A2.6.3. Decertification. When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title. The supervisor shall select the Decertify  button  on  the  screen  menu  and  enter  a  623a  comment  explaining  why  the  task  was decertified, and then enter the Airman into qualification training. The individual is recertified using the normal certification process. A2.6.4. Recertification. When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to annual or bi-annual requirements. The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the recertification was completed. A2.6.5. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and certified to the job performance requirements as specified in the applicable NFPA standard. A2.7. Specialty Training Standard. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their  career  fields.    The  tests  sample  knowledge  of  STS  subject  matter  areas  judged  by  test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotions  References  and  Requirements Catalog. Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces. A3. Recommendations.

(Example: b and 1b) ** A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks. - This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CC. X Training is required but not given due to limitations in resources. Specific tasks not identified with a symbol or proficiency code key (blank) indicates that no training is provided in the course or CC. Major commands and /or units may establish scale values and combat training as dictated by mission requirements. Note 1: Trainers are responsible for annotating references to identify current sources pending STS revision. Note 2: Underlined training references are commercial publications or other publications essential for enlisted specialty training and mission accomplishment. Note 3: Items located in column 4 of the STS that list an NFPA standard as a technical reference, the supporting knowledge/tasks, and their associated behaviors are found in the referenced NFPA standard. These items will not include a proficiency code, but will be trained in the resident course or certification course to a level that meets minimum NFPA requirements as defined by AFCEC/CXF and as authorized by the MAJCOMs. Note 3 is referenced as N3 in the STS.  For advanced and supplemental course taught at Goodfellow AFB, the schoolhouse will develop a course training standard (CTS) approved by the CFM. Note 4:  When a knowledge/task in a referenced NFPA standard cannot be taught in a resident course, the affected knowledge/task will be identified in this training standard using the standard proficiency code key found on the previous page. Note 5: NFPA knowledge/tasks that are requirements for a previous certification level will normally not be repeated in a resident course. Note 6: All STS knowledge/tasks listed in the 3-level residence column are considered core/war tasks and will be taught in a 3-level wartime course.  When an item lists an NFPA standard as a reference, all supporting knowledge and tasks are trained in the resident wartime course unless otherwise noted. Note 7: Specialized courses are designed and specifically geared towards duty position qualifications. Although they are listed in the five skill level column, these courses are applicable for people filling 5-, 7-, 9- and CEM skill level duty positions. For example, an Assistant Chief for Operations must be certified at the Fire Officer III, Fire Instructor II, Fire Inspector II and HAZMAT Incident Commander levels.  Applicable duty position certification requirements are listed in Part II of the CFETP. 40         CFETP 3E7X1 C1, 1 January 2017 A5.  Specialty Training Standard A5.1.  Identification.  In the automated training record User Profile section the UTM will assign individuals to the correct workcenter upon in processing into the unit. A5.1.1. For new trainee the UTM will assist them in creating a training record on the AFCEC-VLC  and  placing  them  in  the  correct  workcenter  and  specialty  within  their  unit.  Additional information will need to be entered into the following areas: A5.1.1.1. User Administrators: A5.1.1.1.1.  Individual UTM A5.1.1.1.2.  Workcenter Supervisor A5.1.1.1.3.

The following are tasks the workcenter supervisor will use to create the duty task list for each 3, 5, and 7 skill level duty position created for their workcenter.  The STS contains only the minimum tasks necessary for each skill level.  Duty positions that require tasks above the minimum can be referenced in Part I, verified through the DoD Firefighter Certification Lookup site, and correlated to the applicable NFPA standard for job performance requirements.  1.

Purpose.  This section of the CFETP identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements available for the fire protection specialty.  Refer to Air Force Civil Engineer Center Virtual Learning Center (AFCEC-VLC) for information on the courses. E2.  MAJCOM-Unique Training Courses. Course Title Spacelift Firefighting Course Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Firefighting Course MAJCOM AFSPC AFGSC  SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING F1.  Purpose.  The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  identify  the  tasks,  training  references,  and training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Civil Engineer forces will train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges  from  knowledge-type  training  conducted  in  a  classroom,  to  task-oriented  hands-on training conducted in the field. These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in  AFI  10-209,  RED  HORSE  Program  and  AFI  10-210,  Prime  Base  Emergency  Engineer Force (BEEF) Program. F2. Home Station Training (HST). HST is knowledge-based and hands-on training that is conducted at the individual’s home station for contingency operations. The CE Commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. F3. Combat Skills Training (CST). CST must be institutionalized as an integral part of any HST program. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught us the importance  of  maintaining  a  higher  level  of  combat  readiness.    Although  the  inclusion  of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps taken to enhance training will help elevate units to a readiness  level  capable  of  supporting  safe  and  effective  operations  in  low  to  medium  risk combat environments.  F4. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEETS). Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations. Due to the cost and complexity, mission essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found at CONUS installations. Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP. AFI 10- 210,  Attachment  4,  identifies  minimum  number  of  personnel  to  be  trained,  positions  by specialty, frequencies and locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.  F5. AF Expeditionary (ES) Training Requirement. AETC, as lead MAJCOM for AF ES training, revamped ancillary home-station and advanced (mission specific) expeditionary skills training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force. The AF ES training is 61   CFETP 3E7X1 C1, 1 January 2017 described as Tier 2 and Tier 3 training below:  F5.1. Tier 2: deployment-ready expeditionary skills training. ES for all Airmen delivered at the wing level in alignment with assigned AEF band. Completion of this training is a requirement to maintain mission-ready status to produce a deployment-ready Airman, up to and including a major combat operation. Tier 2 is designed to ensure every Airman maintains ES proficiency and sustains readiness currency for deployment. Tier 2 curriculum is centrally maintained, but executed at the local level to afford commanders maximum flexibility. Tier 2 is divided into two categories; 2A: ES proficiency training (mostly CBT), and 2B: home-station pre-deployment training.  F5.2. Tier 3:  advanced  ES training (mission specific). Enhanced  ES for  selected Airmen as determined by factors including deployment location, threat assessment, specific mission, duty assignment, role, operation, or special requirement. Tier 3 training provides mission specific ES for the individual Airman and/or team and includes courses designed in response to organic Air Force need or combatant commander-directed theater-specific requirements. Airmen will attend Tier 3 training such as combat Airmen skills training (CAST) when identified through the force generation process and directed in appropriate line remarks/reporting instructions.
