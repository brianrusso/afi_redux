Mission  and  Vision.  The  mission  of  NM  is  to  optimize  health  and  performance  through nutrition.  The NM vision is to be the global leaders in nutrition, fueling performance. 1.2.  Organization.  If  a  separate  NM  Element/Flight  is  feasible,  then  all  NM  personnel  are assigned  to  the  NM  unit  under  Functional  Account  Code  (FAC)  5520  and  matrixed  to  Health Promotion as appropriate to complete health promotion nutrition interventions and provide MNT when indicated.  In clinics, the Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) Commander decides the best location  in  the  organization  for  NM  personnel.    Regardless  of  location,  NM  clinics  with  an assigned  Registered  Dietitian/Registered  Dietitian  Nutritionist  (RD/RDN)  will  simultaneously provide  health  promotion  nutrition  education  programs,  as  well  as  complete  referrals  for  MNT IAW AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management (T-2). Organizational structure for NM flights and elements is more fully described in Chapter 3, Personnel Administration. 1.2.1.  In Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) units, NM personnel may be assigned to the Medical  Squadron  or  Aeromedical  Staging  Squadron  (ASTS)  where  they  may  provide nutrition  education  programs  and  support  the  Air  Force  Fitness  Program.    AFRC  NM personnel are also assigned to active duty NM units.   6  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.  Air Force Surgeon General (AF/SG) shall: 2.1.1.

The  purpose  of  long  and  short  term  strategy  is  to  ensure NM operations and associated activities are aligned with the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) strategy  map.    Individual  NM  organizational  strategies  should  also  be  aligned  with  current, overall  strategic  plans  for  the  career  field.    Management  strategies  provide  the  NM  flight  an opportunity to establish instruction and policies that focus and allocate NM resources.  Strategies should  encompass  both  NM  operations  as  well  as  efforts  to  make  improvements.    Strategic planning  sessions  will  include  representation  from  airmen,  civilians,  contractors,  NCOs,  and senior NM leaders. (T-3).  The NM Organizational Strategy should be consistent with the MTF Strategic  Plan,  and  outline  management  objectives,  improvement  efforts,  and  resources.    Each NM flight  should maintain a department  strategic plan which includes a mission statement and organizational chart, and goals/ objectives/action plans. (T-3) 3.1.1.  Continuous  communication  with  NM  personnel  and  MTF  senior  leaders  should  take place throughout the planning process and implementation of the NM action plans. 3.2.  Performance  Improvement  (PI).  Performance Improvement is a continuous activity that involves  measuring  the  function  of  important  processes  and  services  and  when  indicated, identifies  changes  that  enhance  performance.    These  changes  are  incorporated  into  new  and existing  processes,  products,  or  services  and  are  monitored  to  ensure  improvements  are sustained.    PI  focuses  on  clinical,  administrative  and  cost-of-care  issues  as  well  as  patient outcomes  (results  of  care).    The  fundamental  components  of  PI  include  staff  education, measuring performance through data collection, assessing current performance, utilizing the data collected  to  improve  organizational  processes,  services,  and  overall  performance  and  re-education.  PI includes evaluating the following attributes: efficacy, appropriateness, availability, timeliness, effectiveness, continuity, safety, efficiency, respect, and care.  Performance measures should  focus  on  critical  processes  in  nutrition  care,  food  production  and  management  of personnel  and  financial  resources.    In  addition,  peer  review  is  conducted  and  submitted  in accordance  with  local  credentialing  authority  guidance  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  Dietitian. (T-3). 3.2.1.  PI  activities,  based  on  facility  scope  of  practice  and  capability,  are  focused  on  high-risk, problem prone, high volume and high cost areas but are not limited to those areas. 3.2.1.1.  Examples  of  high-risk  patient  process  include:    patient  tray  food  temperatures, NPO/clear liquid tracking, nutrient-drug interaction counseling documentation, inpatient screening timeframes, and patient tray and menu accuracy. 3.2.1.2.  Examples  of  problem  prone  processes  include:    nutrition  clinic  no-show  rates, kardex  accuracy,  absenteeism  per  time  period,  and  number  of  work  injuries  per  hours worked. 3.2.1.3.  Examples  of  high  volume  and  high  cost  areas  include:    outcomes  of  MNT  for management  of  hyperlipidemia,  diabetes,  and  weight  control,  cost  per  dining  facility meal, cost per patient meal, and cost per unit. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   9  3.2.2.  NM  will  have  Performance  Improvement  Teams  consisting  of  a  team  leader, facilitator, recorder and team members as appropriate.  Meeting minutes will be recorded and maintained. (T-3). 3.3.  Disaster and Contingency Planning.  NM with in-patient feeding capabilities must have a plan  that  establishes  responsibilities  and  basic  procedures  for  feeding  patients  and  staff  during both wartime and peacetime contingency and disaster operations. (T-1).  This plan is an annex in the MTF's Medical Contingency Response Plan (MCRP). 3.4.  Menu  Planning.  The  Flight  Commander/Element  Chief  is  responsible  for  planning  the regular selective cycle and any special menus for the hospital to which they are assigned. (T-3).  The  Chief,  Clinical  Dietetics  is  responsible  for  writing  the  therapeutic  menus.    All  regular  and therapeutic  menus  will  be  approved  by  the  NM  Flight  Commander/Element  Chief.  (T-3).    At hospitals  with  no  dietitian  assigned,  regular  and  therapeutic  menus  will  be  written  by  the NCOIC, NM and approved by the MAJCOM Dietitian. (T-3). 3.4.1.  Cycle  Menu  Planning.  Menu  planning  considerations  should  include  subsistence ordering  and  delivery  schedules,  subsistence  storage  capacity,  available  equipment, subsistence budget,  subsistence seasonal availability, personnel  skills  and abilities, seasonal and  religious  holidays,  patron  preferences,  average  inpatient  length  of  stay,  disease prevalence of patient population, patient age group considerations, cultural nutritional needs, type  of  inpatient  food  service  operation  and  facility  menu  style  (room  service,  a  la  carte, electronic menus, etc.). 3.4.1.1.  All menus are designed to achieve or maintain optimal nutritional status.  To the greatest extent possible, regular/general menus will adhere to the Joint Subsistence Policy Board,  Department  of  Defense  menu  standards,  which  promote  the  United  States Department  of  Agriculture  (USDA),  and  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Service (DHHS)  Dietary  Guidelines  for  Americans.  (T-0).      Therapeutic  menus  will  follow current recommendations for the MNT treatment of such acute and chronic disease states.  Consult  the  AND  Nutrition  Care  Manual  (NCM),  Pediatric  Nutrition  Care  Manual (PNCM), Sports Nutrition Care Manual (SNCM), Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service’s Menu Magic for Children and/or other professional sources for additional information on planning healthy menus. 3.4.1.2.  Evaluate  all  menus  for  nutritional  adequacy.    (T-3).    At  a  minimum,  assess compliance  to  Joint  Subsistence  Policy  Board,  Department  of  Defense  Menu  Standards and  compare  nutrient  content  to  the  USDA  MyPlate  suggested  servings  for  each  food group.    Computrition  and/or  other  commercial  nutrient  analysis  programs  may  be  used for more detailed nutritional analysis as needed. 3.4.1.3.  Develop  the  therapeutic  cycle  menu  using  items  from  the  regular  menu  and  in the  same  sequence,  as  much  as  possible.  (T-3).    The  content  of  the  various  therapeutic diets are a function of and defined by the literature contained within the NCM. 3.4.1.4.  Establish  the  type  of  inpatient  food  service  operation  as  appropriate  for  the facility.    (T-3).    Examples  may  include  but  are  not  limited  to  non-select  menus,  select menus,  buffet-style  selection,  hotel  or  room  service,  or  any  combination.    Create  a hospital master menu in a format most appropriate to easily transfer to the style of menu   10  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 for the facility, i.e., AF Forms 1737 or 1739, Selective Menu, Hotel/Room Service menu, Computrition, etc. (T-3).  Reproduce menus as necessary. 3.4.1.5.  Develop  standard  daily/weekly  rotations  for  nutritional  supplements  and food/snack items, as necessary, to ensure appropriate variety.  (T-3). 3.4.1.6.  At a minimum, update and modify menus annually.  (T-3). 3.4.1.7.  Develop  a  patient/customer  feedback  process  to  evaluate  patient  satisfaction with  menu  items  and  NM  service.    (T-3).    Results  of  patient  satisfaction  surveys  and customer  feedback  can  be  valuable  when  updating  and  modifying  menus  and  food production and service processes. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   11  Chapter 4 PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION  4.1.

Support  for  coordinated undergraduate,  professional  practice,  advanced  degree  dietitian  programs,  or  independent study  programs  for  dietary  managers  must  be  coordinated  through  the  AF  SG  Consultant Dietitian/BSC  Associate  Chief  for  Dietetics.    Additional  staffing  will  not  be  authorized  to support these programs. 4.7.  Workload Reporting. 4.7.1.  Medical  Expense  Personnel  Reporting  System  (MEPRS).  MEPRS  is  an  accounting system  used  by  the  AF  Medical  Service  that  provides  NM  managers  with  manpower,  cost distribution,  expense  and  workload  reporting  data.    NM  expense,  personnel  utilization  and workload data are collected for this system through manual and automated processes.  Since MEPRS  data  are  used  to  determine  manpower  requirements,  expense  allocation  and productivity, NM input needs to be current, accurate and complete. 4.7.1.1.  Personnel Time/Utilization. The timely and accurate control of personnel data is essential for the total success of the MEPRS as personnel costs are the largest expense in the MTF budget.  Time (hours) worked is reported through manual entry into the Defense Medical  Human  Resources  System-internet  (DMHRSi).    Each  individual  is  responsible for accurately reporting hours worked to the correct Functional Cost Codes (FCC). (T-3).  A  work  center  monitor  should  be  appointed  whose  job  it  is  to  review  DMHRSi  for   16  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 accuracy, consistency, and appropriate FCCs, before they are submitted to the DMHRSi Program Manager. 4.7.1.2.  Contract Services/Sharing Agreements. For contracts in any area within dietetics services, the cost should be allocated in the appropriate MEPRS account codes based on the type of work accomplished.  This allocation may be based on contractor estimates or any  method  that  NM  management  deems  appropriate  to  reflect  the  percent  of  cost allocated in each code based on the cost of labor and supplies used. 4.7.2.  Functional  Cost  Codes  (FCCs)  and  Usage.  FCCs  are  used  for  all  DoD  Nutritional Medicine  organizations.  FCCs  are  used  to  record  NM  expenditures,  personnel  time,  and workload.    Specific  written  guidance  governs  MEPRS  procedures  and  FCC  usage:  DoD 6010-13-M, Medical Expense and Performance Reporting System for Fixed Military Medical and  Dental  Treatment  Facilities  Manual,  and  AFI  41-102,  AF  Medical  Expense  and Performance Reporting System (MEPRS) for Fixed Military Medical and Dental Treatment Facilities.  The FCCs that are used most frequently in NM are as follows: 4.7.2.1.  (EIA)  Patient Food Operations. Provides meal service to inpatients, outpatients, and transient patients.  It includes activities such as routine inpatient rounds, therapeutic menu  development,  patient  tray  assembly,  and  any  activities  related  to  patient  feeding. Supply expenditures include the following examples: enteral nutrition formulas, diet kits, paper  products  for  patient  tray  use  only,  insulated  mugs  and  bowls  used  for  the  patient tray line, selective menus, tray mats, office supplies used solely for inpatient feeding. 4.7.2.2.  (EIB)  Combined  Food  Operations.  Includes  subsistence,  food  preparation,  and services that are used for inpatient or non-patient feeding in the dining facility.  This may include  menu  and  recipe  development  for  regular  menu  items,  sanitation  of  combined areas, and subsistence accounting.  Supply expenditures include the following examples: cleaning supplies, plastic wrap, cooks’ knives, flatware, china, glassware, general office supplies, and paper products used for both patient tray assembly and the dining facility. 4.7.2.3.  (EIC)  Inpatient Clinical Dietetics. Includes basic and comprehensive nutritional care  for  patients.    Activities  include  coordination  of  changes  in  diet  requirements; developing  nutrition  care  plans;  nutritional  assessment  and  counseling,  and  clinical nutrition  management  activities.    Supply  expenditures  include  pocket  computers  for inpatient dietitians. 4.7.2.4.  (FDC)  Non-patient  Food  Operations.  Includes  nutrition  management  expenses unrelated to patient care, but in support of staff and visitors.  To include cashiers, serving line, and dining facility functions.  Supply expenses include dining facility trays, supplies for cafeteria serving line, cash register tape, and napkins for dining facility use. 4.7.2.5.  (BAL)  Outpatient  Nutrition  Clinic.  Includes  comprehensive  nutritional  care  to outpatients  including  appointment  scheduling,  assessing  and  planning  nutrition  care, individual  and  group  instruction,  and  publication  management  of  instruction  materials and  handouts.    Supply  expenses  include  nutrient  analysis  programs  used  for  weight management,  nutrition  clinic  office  supplies,  instructional  materials  used  for  outpatient counseling. 4.7.2.6.  (FCGH)  Health  Promotion.    Includes  awareness,  education,  and  interventions that  support  the  Health  Promotion  target  areas  of  Tobacco-Free  Living,  Nutritional AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   17  Fitness,  Physical  Activity,  Healthy  Weight  and  other  Health  Promotion  initiatives  as indicated.    EBBH  should  be  used  for  administrative  oversight  of  Health  Promotion programs.  Non-MNT nutrition education should be counted as FCGH versus BALA. 4.7.3.  Inpatient weighted nutrition procedures are provided to RMO monthly for inclusion in MEPRS.  This is critical manpower data and should be reviewed monthly by NM leadership to ensure accuracy.  (T-3).   18  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 5 NUTRITION CARE 5.1.  Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT). 5.1.1.  MNT  is  the  development  and  provision  of  specific  nutrition  procedures  in  the treatment  of  a  disease  or  condition,  or  as  a  means  to  prevent  or  delay  disease  or complications  and  optimize  health  and  performance.    MNT  includes  performing  a comprehensive  nutrition  assessment  to  determine  a  nutrition  diagnosis,  planning  and implementing a nutrition intervention using evidence-based nutrition practice guidelines, and monitoring and evaluating an individual’s progress over subsequent visits.  The level, content and  frequency  of  nutrition  services  that  are  appropriate  for  optimal  care  and  nutrition outcomes are individualized by the nutrition professional providing the MNT. 5.1.1.1.  MNT  is  provided  using  the  Nutrition  Care  Process  (NCP)  developed  and advocated  for  by  AND.  Documentation  of  care  within  the  NCP  utilizes  established terminology,  with  the  goal  of  effectively  communicating  well  defined  components  of MNT.    The  NCP  is  a  systematic  approach  to  providing  high  quality  nutrition  care  and consists  of  four  distinct  and  interrelated  steps:    nutrition  assessment,  diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring/evaluation. 5.1.1.2.  Evidence-Based Dietetics Practice and Standards.  MNT is provided based on an integration of the best available and up-to-date scientific evidence, professional expertise and client values to improve outcomes.  The AND’s NCM and PNCM are the preferred source  for  evidence-based  dietetics  practice  and  patient  education.    However,  other professional  sources  may  include  but  are  not  limited  to:  the  AND’s  Evidence  Analysis Library,  Veteran’s  Health  Administration  (VA)/DoD  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines, National  Kidney  Foundation,  American  Society  for  Parenteral  and  Enteral  Nutrition (ASPEN),  American  Heart  Association,  American  Diabetes  Association,  the  National Institutes  of  Health  (NIH),  TRICARE  Online,  Medline  Plus,  Military  One  Source,  and the U.S. National Library of Medicine. 5.1.1.3.  The NCM, PNCM, and SNCM are comprehensive online resources that cover all aspects of nutrition management, and each MTF is encouraged to purchase each manual that  is  appropriate  to  service  their  specific  patient  population,  in  the  volume  of subscriptions  adequate for their facility.  Prior to  purchasing, coordinate with  AND and the local Information Technology (IT)/Systems department to ensure the MTF’s range of computer URLs can access the manual(s) at any one time up to the limit of subscriptions purchased.    Ideally,  access  to  the  NCM  should  be  through  the  local  intranet  (vs.  with  a username and password), but local IT guidance should be sought.  Ensure the link to the care  manuals  are  centrally  located,  i.e.,  Medical  Group  (MDG)  Intranet,  for  all  MTF personnel and providers to access, and market the availability and use of these resources. 5.1.2.  Reproducible  patient  education  materials  from  sources  other  than  those  listed  above may be utilized at the discretion of the credentialed RD. 5.1.3.  Providing MNT. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   19  5.1.3.1.  Credentialed  RDs  and/or  authorized  diet the supervision of a credentialed RD) provide MNT. (T-0).  MNT is an essential component of  comprehensive  healthcare.    Appropriate  screening  processes  should  be  developed  to identify  those  beneficiaries  who  would  benefit  from  MNT  in  either  the  inpatient  or outpatient setting. therapy  personnel  (under 5.1.3.2.  The screening and referral process should be coordinated to involve appropriate medical, nursing and ancillary personnel, and to identify those patients who would most benefit from the provision of MNT.  . 5.1.3.3.  Patients who will benefit from MNT include (but are not limited to) those with diabetes,  pediatric  failure  to  thrive,  dyslipidemia,  hypertension,  malnutrition,  high-risk pregnancy,  renal  disease,  inflammatory  bowel  disease,  celiac  disease,    liver  disease, obesity  or  pre  or  post  bariatric  surgery,  metabolic  syndrome,  or  are  receiving  enteral and/or parenteral nutrition. 5.1.4.  RDs  and  other  providers  such  as  physicians,  dentists,  certified  nurse-midwives (CNM), physician assistants (PA), nurse practitioners, and pharmacists may provide nutrition education  IAW  their  MTF  clinical  privileges  and  AFI  44-119,  however  this  information should  be  consistent  with  evidence  based  care  guidelines  and  appropriate  to  the  patient condition or disease state. 5.1.4.1.  Diet therapy craftsmen provide MNT as authorized by AF Form 628 and can be authorized  to  provide  MNT  IAW  Attachment  2,  Diet  Counseling  Authorization  Guide.  (T-3).    Using  this  guide,  the  authorizing/credentialed  RD  determines  what  diets  a  diet therapy  craftsman  may  be  certified  on  based  on  their  assessment  of  the  diet  therapy craftsman’s knowledge,  ability, and skills.    In  addition,  the authorizing/credentialed RD defines  the  diet  therapy  craftsman’s  scope  of  practice  and  required  level  of  supervision for each diet authorization. 5.1.4.2.  MNT  for  inpatients  may  be  provided  without  consult  based  on  the  patient’s assessed nutrition  risk per the MTF’s inpatient nutrition  screening procedures.  Medical staff  can  also  consult  for  inpatient  NM  services  using  SF  513,  Medical  Record  – Consultation Sheet, or electronic/MTF equivalent. 5.1.4.3.  Inpatient  diet  orders,  to  include  enteral  nutrition  support,  nourishments,  and nutritional  supplements,  are  ordered  via  the  inpatient  electronic  medical  record  system.  (T-3). 5.1.4.4.  Diet  orders  will  be  for  regular  or  therapeutic  diets  offered  at  the  facility.    The available  therapeutic  diets  will  be  based  upon  the  needs  of  the  population  served.  Components  and  defining  characteristics  of  therapeutic  diets  will  be  consistent  with guidance  from  the  Nutrition  Care  Manual.  (T-0).      Nonstandard  diets  requested  by  the ordering provider to meet unique patient needs will be coordinated with the RD providing care to that patient and/or the NM Flight Commander/Element Chief.  See paragraph 5.3.  (T-3). 5.1.4.5.  For  Nutritional  Medicine  Clinics  (NMCs)  with  an  assigned  RD,  MNT  for outpatients  is  provided  based  on  provider  referral  using  SF  513  or  electronic/MTF equivalent.    (T-3).      Clients  may  also  self-refer  IAW  MTF/Outpatient  Nutrition  Clinic guidance.    Generally,  self-referrals  to  the  outpatient  nutrition  clinic  are  limited  to   20  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 participation  in  group  classes.    Local  considerations,  including  characteristics  of  the beneficiary  population,  resource  constraints  and  MTF  leadership  priorities,  will  drive decisions  regarding  provision  of  outpatient  MNT.    The  MTF  Commander  will  consider options  to  ensure  that  all  patients  receive  high  quality  nutrition  services  when  the  MTF does  not  have  an  outpatient  RD  or  diet  therapist  assigned,  or  when  the  need  for  MNT within  the  beneficiary  population  exceeds  resources  available.  (T-3).      Possible  options include hiring a full-time or part-time civilian RD, contracting for nutrition services, tele-wellness referral (if available/appropriate), or referral to an off-base provider if the MNT benefit  is  covered  by  TRICARE.    The  MAJCOM  Dietitian  is  also  a  resource  for coordinating MNT. 5.1.5.  MNT Outcomes and Outcomes Management 5.1.5.1.  MNT outcomes are measurable benefits and include: improvements in patients’ clinical,  functional/behavioral,  quality  of  life/satisfaction,  or  financial  status  as  a  direct result  of  MNT.    Tracking  and  documenting  MNT  outcomes  is  important  because  in managed care, medical services are reimbursable insurance benefits only if they produce positive outcomes in a cost-effective manner. 5.1.5.2.  For  NMCs  with  an  assigned  RD,  each  MTF  will  identify,  prioritize  and  track MNT outcomes significant for their patient population and relevant to the AF and/or the MTF’s  interdisciplinary  teams,  case  managers,  and  disease  and  condition  management programs. (T-3).   Committees such as the Integrated Delivery System (IDS), Population Health  Working  Group,  and  Environment  of  Care,  may  be  resourceful  avenues  for tracking and marketing MNT outcomes. 5.1.5.3.  The USAF Dietetics Benchmarking Tool can be used to track key metrics within USAF  dietetics.    Within  the  domain  of  MNT  and  clinical  dietetics,  relevant  metrics  for inpatients  include:    number  of  inpatient  meals,  number  of  inpatients,  weighted  diet census,  inpatient  weighted  nutrition  procedures,  and  staffing  metrics.    For  outpatient MNT,  RVU  generation,  Defense  Enrollment  Eligibility  Reporting  System  (DEERS) population numbers, presence of civilian and contracted RDs providing outpatient MNT, and relevant MEPRS data should be tracked.  This information is reported up from each NM to  the MAJCOM Dietitian and to  the AF SG Consultant Dietitian.  (T-3).  Metrics being tracked by the Population Health Working Group, such as patients with abnormal HgbA1C  values  or  elevated  lipid  levels,  may  be  appropriate  targets  for  MNT  outcomes collection.    For  RDs  or  Diet  Therapy  Craftsman  who  must  divide  their  time  between population  health  and  MNT,  this  information  may  assist  in  prioritizing  patient populations to serve and time spent.  The NM Flight Commander/Element Chief should be  aware  of  unique  factors  within  the  population  (e.g.,  related  to  the  mission  of  the installation), top 5 or top 10 ICD-9 diagnosis codes pertinent to nutrition, stated concerns or  objectives  of  the  MTF  leadership  or  installation  leadership  that  are  pertinent  to dietetics, and should use this information when establishing local outcomes for tracking.  The NM Flight Commander/Element Chief should also consult with MTF coding experts, Resource Management Office (RMO) personnel, and other MTF personnel, to understand expectations  regarding  RVU  generation,  tracking  and  facility  standards  which  will pertain to the NM Flight/Element.  NM Flight Commander/Element Chief should look to optimize coding and documentation in accordance with local and USAF guidance.  When selecting  appropriate  local  outcomes  for  tracking  MNT  effectiveness,  the  NM  Flight AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   21  Commander/Element  Chief  should  consider  use  of  the  Nutrition  Care  Process  (NCP).  The  NCP  is  appropriate  for  use  at  the  individual  patient  level,  or  for  populations  and groups.    Appropriate  population  assessment,  establishing  specific  nutrition  problems which  require  nutrition  intervention,  and  selection  of  meaningful  monitoring  and evaluation criteria are part of effective outcomes management. 5.2.  Patient Rights and Privacy. 5.2.1.  All patients have the right to be informed about and participate in their nutrition care.  Reasonable  efforts  should  be  made  to  ensure  patients’  food  preferences  are  noted,  menus individualized,  learning  needs  accommodated  and  special  needs  are  met  when  applicable.  NM  personnel  will  comply  with  all  Privacy  Act  guidance  and  instructions  such  as  AFI  33-332,  Air  Force  Privacy  Act  Program,  and the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability Act (HIPAA). (T-0). 5.3.  Nutrition Screening. 5.3.1.  MTF/NM will develop  a nutrition  screening process  to  determine the nutritional risk for both inpatients and outpatients. (T-0).  The screening and referral process should include appropriate  medical,  nursing  and  ancillary  personnel  both in  development  and implementation to best capture those patients who would most benefit from the provision of MNT. 5.3.2.  MTF  policies  and  operating  instructions  will  detail  both  inpatient  and  outpatient populations  to  be  screened,  screening  criteria  and  local  processes  and  documentation techniques.  (T-3).    A  RD  will  educate  the  MTF  staff  on  nutrition  screening  policies  and procedures  as  applicable.  (T-3).    Regardless  of  the  screening  process  developed,  the  NM Flight  Commander/Element  Chief  should  ensure  that  existing  policies  (inpatient  and outpatient)  are  updated  appropriately,  compliance  with  the  policy  is  enforced,  training  is conducted regularly, and modifications to the process are reflected in policy revisions. 5.3.2.1.  Nutrition screening is not considered part of the Nutrition Care Process, but is an essential precursor to the NCP.  A selected nutrition screening process should reflect the unique needs of the population served as well as the resources and considerations of the facility.  The AND’s Evidence Analysis Library (EAL) can serve as a resource to locate validated, reliable screening and assessment tools.  Other resources for use in developing a nutrition screening process include, but are not limited to, the AND’s Pocket Guide to Nutrition  Assessment,  ASPEN  Core  Curriculum  or  practice  guidelines,  and  the  CNM Nutrition Screening Practices in Health Care Organizations. 5.3.3.  Inpatient screening. 5.3.3.1.  It is advisable that the existing admission assessment documentation (e.g., initial nursing assessment and/or the history and physical) be reviewed and incorporated into a nutrition  screening  process.    This  documentation  may  be  a  standard  Essentris  form  and modifications should be coordinated with Information Technology (IT) staff. 5.3.3.2.  Inpatient  nutrition  screening  is  completed  within  24  hours  of  admission  to  the MTF.    (T-0).    This  screening  can  be  conducted  by  medical  personnel  outside  of  NM according to locally developed processes.  NM Flight Commander/Element Chief should   22  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 regularly  monitor  the  performance  of  the  local  screening  process  to  ensure  compliance and efficacy. 5.3.3.3.  Pre-admission  screening  procedures  are  developed  depending  upon  NM resources and facility needs. 5.3.3.4.  Dietitians will initiate the provision of MNT for inpatients identified as being at nutrition risk, based upon local procedures and timelines. (T-3). 5.3.4.  Outpatient screening 5.3.4.1.  Diagnoses  of  interest  should  include:  diabetes,  pediatric  failure  to  thrive, dyslipidemia,  hypertension,  malnutrition,  high-risk  pregnancy, renal  disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, liver disease, obesity or pre or post bariatric surgery, metabolic syndrome, or those requiring enteral and/or parenteral nutrition.  Other diagnoses could be added based upon local population needs as determined by providers. 5.3.4.2.  Coordination with the local contracted entity performing appointment scheduling is  recommended.    Additionally,  the  provider  staff  should  be  educated  on  appropriate wording and information to include in consults to NM.  This will minimize inappropriate self-referrals or unclear provider referrals. 5.3.4.3.  NM/MTF  will  develop  operating  guidance  for  an  outpatient  nutrition  clinic  to include patient referral, scheduling, class preparation, patient/family check-in procedures, lesson  plans,  education  evaluation  tools,  communication  with  other  health  care professionals,  and  documentation.  (T-3).    Upon  outpatient  check  in,  two  patient identifiers need to be requested to validate the patient’s identify.  (T-0). 5.3.5.  Additional  considerations  for  specific  inpatient  populations  such  as  obstetrics  or pediatrics are considered as appropriate. 5.4.  Documentation and Peer Review. 5.4.1.  MNT is documented in the inpatient EHR (Essentris) and outpatient electronic health record  (AHLTA)  or  other  MTF  equivalent  using  the  Assessment,  Diagnosis,  Intervention, Monitoring, Evaluation (A.D.I.M.E.) format, as applicable.  (T-3). 5.4.1.1.  Additional hard-copy document forms include SF 513, SF 509, Medical Record Progress Note, and SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care. 5.4.1.2.

When documenting MNT via hard-copy  forms  the signature block format will be (T-3): Name, Grade, USAF, BSC AFSC 43D3, Registered Dietitian or  Name, Grade, USAF AFSC 4D0X1, Diet Therapy Journeyman/Craftsman 5.4.2.  Assessment  data is found on the following forms  or electronic/MTF equivalent:   AF Form  2572,  Nutritional  Assessment  of  Dietary  Intake;  AF  Form  2508,  Calorie  Count;  DD AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   23  Form  792,  Twenty-four  Hour  Patient  Intake  and  Output  Worksheet;  and  AF  Form  3067, Intravenous Record. 5.4.3.  Peer  review  is  conducted  quarterly.    See  paragraphs  9.2.4.4  and  9.2.4.4.1-3  for  peer review details.  (T-3). 5.4.4.  RDs  conduct  and  attend  inpatient  dietary  patient  rounds,  medical  patient  rounds, nutrition  support  committee  rounds,  and  discharge  planning  whenever  possible.    (T-3).  Pertinent patient data/notes are recorded in the MTF electronic health record.  (T-3). in such 5.4.5.  Participation interdisciplinary,  patient-centered  activities  enhances communication  between  care  providers  and  allows  the  RD  to  obtain  additional  patient information  for  assessments  and  re-assessments,  menu  selection  assistance,  information regarding  food  preferences  or  intolerances,  food  allergies,  educational  needs,  etc.    In addition, nutrition needs after discharge can be coordinated as needed. 5.5.  Ordering Inpatient Meals and Nourishments. 5.5.1.  Nursing Service uses AF Form 1094, Diet Order, AF Form 2567, Diet Order Change, Composite Health Care System (CHCS), Essentris or electronic/MTF equivalent to order or communicate the following to NM:  therapeutic and non-therapeutic diets, Nothing Per Oral (NPO), or out on pass; tube feedings; Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN); food allergies; age of pediatric  patients;  special  tray  preparations;  and  new  patient  admissions,  discharges,  or transfers. 5.5.1.1.  Local  NM/MTF  establishes  guidance  when  diet  orders  and  diet  order  changes are  required  by  NM  to  properly  and  effectively  serve  patient  meals  and  nourishments.  Ideally,  Nursing  Service  submits  diet  orders  daily  NLT  0500  hours,  and  diet  order changes NLT 1000 and 1500 hours. 5.5.1.2.  All  diet  orders  will  comply  with  the  AND  as  well  as  both  print  and  online versions of the NCM, PNCM, and SNCM. (T-0). 5.5.1.3.  Therapeutic  in-flight  meals  (TIM)  for  patients  in  the  aeromedical  evacuation system are ordered using AF Form 2464, CTIM Telephone Diet Order, or electronic/MTF equivalent. (T-3). 5.5.2.  Nourishment Service. 5.5.2.1.  Individual Nourishments. 5.5.2.1.1.  The  RD  or  other  authorized  health  care  provider  will  order  additional individual  patient  nourishments  on  AF  Form  2568,  Nourishment  Request,  on  AF Form 1094 or electronic/MTF-equivalent as appropriate. (T-3). 5.5.2.1.2.  NM personnel ensure the individual nourishment is in compliance with the current  diet  order.  (T-3).    NM  will  call  the  RD,  Nursing  Service,  and/or  patient’s provider to clarify all ambiguous nourishment requests. (T-3). 5.5.2.1.3.  All  individual  nourishments,  diet  specific  or  additionally  ordered,  will  be maintained on AF Form 1741 or electronic/MTF-equivalent. (T-3).   24  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 5.5.2.1.4.  NM  prepares  nourishments  and  nourishment  labels  to  include:    patient’s name, inpatient unit, room number, hour to serve, food item(s), preparation date and time, and expiration date.  (T-3). 5.5.2.1.5.  NM  delivers  nourishments  to  Nursing  Service  or  patients  based  on  local guidance.  (T-3). 5.5.2.2.  Bulk Nourishments. 5.5.2.2.1.  NM will develop guidance for Nursing Service to order bulk nourishments for  supplemental  patient  feeding.  (T-3).    For  example,  frozen  meals  are  commonly obtained  by  nutritional  medicine  and  distributed  to  the  inpatient  units  on  a  nightly basis  in  case  a  patient  is  admitted  after  the  evening  meal  tray  collection,  ensuring these patients receive a hot meal as needed.  In addition, meals for residents working overnight are commonly prepared and delivered IAW facility-specific guidance. 5.5.2.2.1.1.  Outpatient  clinics  will  procure their  own  supply  of  patient nourishments  using  their  own  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC)  and  funding source.    (T-3).

Nursing  Service  will  order  bulk  nourishments  on  AF  Form  2568  or electronic/MTF-equivalent.   NM  will  approve,  prepare,  and  deliver  bulk nourishment requests IAW local guidance.  (T-3).  Nursing will sign for receipt of nourishment delivery.  (T-3). 5.5.2.2.1.3.  All bulk nourishment items are labeled with the following:  Inpatient unit, food item, date and time prepared, and expiration date.  (T-3). 5.5.2.3.  All nourishments, individual or bulk, are for patient feeding only.  Nourishments are not to be consumed by hospital staff or visitors.  (T-3). 5.5.2.4.  Nourishments are modified based on food tolerances, food allergies, preferences and diet order as appropriate and whenever possible.  (T-3). 5.5.2.5.  Inpatient Nourishment Refrigerators. 5.5.2.5.1.  Nursing  Service  will  monitor  temperatures  for  inpatient  refrigerators  and freezers used for patient nourishments. (T-3). 5.5.2.5.2.  Temperatures  are  monitored  three  times  a  day  with  thermometers  located in  the  interior  of  the  refrigerator  and  freezer  compartments.  (T-3).    The  outside temperature  gauge  on  the  equipment  is  not  always  reliable  and  will  not  be  used  to monitor interior temperatures. (T-3). 5.5.2.5.3.  Record  temperatures  on  a  temperature  chart  according  to  local  guidance. (T-3). 5.5.2.5.4.  Acceptable temperature range for refrigerators is 34 to 40˚ Fahrenheit.  The acceptable  temperature  range  for  freezers  is  -10  to  10˚  Fahrenheit.    Acceptable temperature ranges should adhere to AFMAN 48-147_IP, Tri-Service Food Code. 5.5.2.5.5.  Local  guidance  must  indicate  specific  procedures  to  be  followed  should temperatures fall below standards. (T-3). AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   25  5.6.  Inpatient Meal Service 5.6.1.  NM will develop local procedures for providing inpatient meal service. (T-3).  Several variations  of  service  are  available  and  may  include  selective  menus,  nonselective  menus, room service or hotel style, or a combination of them all. 5.6.1.1.  Procedures will outline how often patients on non-selective therapeutic diets are visited on inpatient dietary rounds as applicable. (T-3). 5.6.2.  Menu  tickets,  hard  copy  or  electronic  (Computrition),  are  used  to  assemble  and identify  food  trays  for  inpatients.  (T-3).    In  accordance  with  Joint  Commission  standards, menu tickets are to contain two patient identifiers.  (T-0).  As such, menu tickets are treated as  personal  information  and  are  protected  under  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and Accountability  Act  (HIPAA)  and  must  be  either  filed  or  disposed  of  in  an  appropriate  and consistent  manner  (i.e.  shredded  upon  discharge).  (T-3).    In  addition,  menu  tickets  must contain  the  appropriate  privacy  act  information,  such  as:  “FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY.  This page contains information protected under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. Do not disclose without authorization”.  (T-0). 5.6.2.1.  The NM flight of each MTF generates their own menu tickets based on type of menus  offered,  type  food  service  operation  employed,  and  existing  specific  therapeutic diets. (T-3).  This allows for personalization of menu items relative the diet-types offered and  enables  menus  to  be  updated  as  needed  based  on  food  item  availability  from  their prime vendor. 5.6.3.  Menu patterns are modified based on food tolerances, food allergies, preferences and diet order as appropriate and whenever possible. (T-3). 5.6.4.  Salt Substitute.  Do not give salt substitute to patients unless ordered by the healthcare provider.    Use  mixtures  of  appropriate  herbs  and  spices  (non-sodium  and  non-potassium based) instead. (T-3). 5.6.5.  Disposable Tray  Service.  Isolation trays need not  be routinely used for patients  with contagious  diseases  or  infections  per  AFI  44-108,  Infection  Control  Program.  (T-3).    Use disposable tray service for radiation ablation therapy patients according to local procedures.  (T-3). 5.6.6.  Psychiatric  Patients.  Nursing  Service  orders  “paper  products  for  precautionary measures”  for  patients  who  could  hurt  themselves  or  others.    Identify  these  patients  by stamping menu slips with “paper products.” (T-3).  Other patient populations (e.g., radiation ablation) may also require similar considerations; policies should reflect patient needs. 5.6.7.  Mothers  of  breastfed  pediatric  inpatients  are  authorized  inpatient  meal  service.  Follow all procedures outlined above for inpatients. (T-3). 5.6.7.1.  Provisions  may  be  made  to  provide  postpartum  mothers  and  their  guest  a  one-time “Proud Parent” meal.  One guest of the post-partum mother may purchase a meal at the proportional BDFA rate and must pay for the meal prior to the meal service. 5.7.  Dietary Kardex (AF Form 1741) or Electronic/MTF-Equivalent. 5.7.1.  NM  will  establish  local  procedures  for  use  of  AF  Form  1741  or  electronic/MTF-equivalent. (T-3).   26  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 5.7.2.  Create  and  complete  a  patient  Kardex  to  communicate  current  and  future  nutritional care to other dietitians and diet therapy personnel.  (T-3). 5.7.2.1.  Patient  information  to  record,  maintain,  and  update  on  the  Kardex  include patient’s  name,  age,  gender,  diet  order,  nutritional  risk  level,  food  preferences,  food allergies,  scheduled  nourishments,  nutrient/drug  interactions,  etc.    As  appropriate,  these considerations will be incorporated into provision of patient meals (see 5.5). (T-3). 5.7.3.  Initial/sign  each  entry  made  to  the  patient  Kardex  when  more  than  one  person performs dietary rounds or charting procedures. (T-3). 5.7.4.  A  patient  Kardex  is  maintained  until  the  patient  is  discharged.  (T-3).    Create procedures  to  maintain  a  Kardex  file  for  patients  who  are  frequently  re-admitted  to  ensure continuity of care. (T-3). 5.7.5.  Use the reverse side of AF Form 1741 to compute nonstandard therapeutic diets. (T-3). 5.7.5.1.

NM  does  not  prepare,  provide,  or  administer parenteral  nutrition solutions.  (T-3). 5.11.4.  Arrangements for home TPN are available through discharge planning. 5.12.  Therapeutic Diets for Outpatients. 5.12.1.  Outpatients are generally not provided meals at the expense of the NMF.  There are situations  that  vary  between  installations  wherein  meals  or  snacks  are  provided  to  diabetic patients who have been in the Emergency Department (ED) for over 4 hours and admission to the hospital is anticipated. 5.12.2.  Various  outpatient  locations  (i.e.  ED,  Hematology/Oncology)  may  request  snack items  for  patients  for  whom  they  anticipate  an  extended  stay  in  the  MTF  while  in  nursing care that require nutrition, and may be requested on SF 513 or electronic/MTF equivalent. 5.13.  Patient and Family Education. 5.13.1.  Patient  and  family  education  is  provided  throughout  the  continuum  of  care  to  meet ongoing nutritional and behavioral needs. (T-3).  It should include interactive, collaborative, and  interdisciplinary  processes  that  promote  healthy  behavior  and  encourage  patient/family involvement in the nutritional plan of care. 5.13.2.  The  need  for  patient  and  family  education  for  inpatients  is  assessed  during implementation  of the NCP.  (T-3).  The need  for outpatient education is  assessed  at  clinic encounters.  (T-3). 5.13.3.  Nutrition  intervention  takes  into  consideration  cultural  and  religious  practices, emotional  barriers,  desire  and  motivation  to  learn,  physical  and  cognitive  limitations, language barriers, and financial implication of care choices. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   29  5.13.4.  Patient  and  family  education  is  interactive  and  addresses  potential  nutrient-drug interactions,  nutrition  interventions,  modified  diets,  patient  and  family  responsibilities,  and follow-up information on accessing future care or community resources.  (T-3). 5.13.5.  Patient  education  is  documented  as  part  of  the  care  provided,  in  the  inpatient  or outpatient  EHR  as  appropriate.    (T-3).    Additional  hard-copy  document  forms  include  SF 513,  SF  509,  and  SF  600.    Nutrition  education  and  MNT  for  patients/families  commonly offered  should  be  IAW  AFI  44-102  and/or  based  on  the  needs  of  the  MTF/base  patient population and NM staffing and resources. 5.14.  Health Promotion Nutrition. 5.14.1.  Nutrition  plays  an  important  role  in  the  AF  Health  Promotion  Program  (HPP).  Health status is dependent upon the collective behaviors, attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs of family and community.  To meet nutrition and fitness goals and outcomes, all interventions should  use  multiple  modalities  of  the  Intervention  Pyramid  (see  AFI  40-101,  Guidance Document).    Delivery  of  programs  and  services  are  provided  in  locations  where  target populations  live,  work,  and  play  with  emphasis  on  high  population  reach  programs  and strategies. 5.14.2.  The  scope  of  practice  for    Health  Promotion  is  to  assess  base  population  and environmental  nutrition  needs,  plan,  collaborate,  implement  and  evaluate  community nutrition  strategies,  interventions  and  programs  and  use  multiple,  evidence-based  strategies and interventions with the largest reach to impact population eating behaviors and outcomes.  Health Promotion Nutrition is addressed in AFI 40-104.   30  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 6 FOOD PRODUCTION AND SERVICE 6.1.  Production Planning. 6.1.1.  (Automated)  Production  Planning.    NM  personnel  will  utilize  Computrition  to automate  their  production  planning  processes  IAW  the  current  instructions  outlined  in  the Computrition Training & Reference Guide and Food Operations Management (FOM) User’s Reference Guide. (T-3). 6.1.1.1.  Menu Maintenance. 6.1.1.1.1.  All  meal  changes  and  assignment  of  meals  to  cycle  days  is  performed under the Menu Maintenance function in Computrition. (T-3). 6.1.1.1.2.  All  recipes  and  food  items  are  verified  as  being  on  the  menu  either  by crosschecking the screen or by using the View at Glance Report. (T-3). 6.1.1.1.3.  Once  the  recipes  and  food  items  are  verified,  run  the  Menu  Item  Cost Report. (T-3).  This report must be run at least monthly, however, running the report weekly to update the food costs in the system is recommended. (T-3). 6.1.1.1.4.  Next, run the Recipe Price Report to obtain the updated costs. (T-3).  Note:  The Menu Cost Report must be run prior to running the Recipe Price Report.  (T-3). 6.1.1.2.  Forecasting. 6.1.1.2.1.  Forecasting is available when the menu is corrected and verified. 6.1.1.2.2.  Forecast for menu items that require controlled quantity production. (T-3).  Daily  consumables  such  as  PC  condiments,  fountain  soda,  fresh  fruit  and  other similar items do not need to be forecasted within Computrition, but can be monitored each  month  in  Computrition  to  better  help  with  ordering.    To  monitor  daily consumables,  create  a  Cost  Center (system setup>tables>items>cost centers) and use the Requisition Out to show how much was used  during  the  week.    The  review  of  the  previous  month’s  daily  consumables utilization should assist with ordering/forecasting. the  Cost  Center  Table in 6.1.1.2.3.  The  Menu  Maintenance  function  of  Computrition  is  where  the  site manager identifies what courses are to be forecasted (soup, entree, vegetable, etc.). 6.1.1.2.4.  In  Computrition,  go  to  Menus  Post  Meal  Count  function  and  enter  the number of meals served into the actual count fields. (T-3).  Click calculated prepared button to automatically populate amounts in the prepared field. (T-3).  There are three options  for  forecasting  to  choose  from:  1.  Do  not  apply  batching,  Forecast  equals Prepared  (selected  by  default).    This  option  sets  all  prepared  amounts  to  forecasts amounts.  2. Batch (each menu meal separately).  Select this option if batching should be included for prepared amounts.  3. Overwrite existing prepared figures.  Select this option to overwrite any numbers that have been entered in the prepared fields.  Once an  option  is  chosen,  click  in  the  Served  field  of  each  recipe  and  type  the  amounts served.  When amounts are placed in this field, figures are automatically entered into AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   31  the  Leftover  and  Next  Time  fields.    The  Percent  Count  field  is  active  if  the  Served amount  is  less  than  the  prepared  amount.    Click  the  Review  Counts  button  to  show counts and have the ability to copy them forward to the next time the menu is served.  A  number  must  be  in  the  Served  and  Next  Time  fields  of  each  recipe  in  order  for counts to be copy forward. 6.1.1.3.  Calculate  Yield  Adjust.    The  post  meal  count  function  of  Computrition  to forecast must be used at least five days prior to the day that the user would like to yield adjust. (T-3).  This is necessary for the pulling of food items three days prior to use (early withdrawal;  frozen  meats,  etc.)  and  prepping  of  items  two  days  prior  to  actual  meal service (pre-preparation; gelatins, etc.). 6.1.1.4.  Run Production Reports.  Once the Post Meal Counts have been completed and copied forward, run the Production Worksheet Report.  (T-3). This report provides a list of  recipes  and  amounts  required  for  producing  the  selected  menus  and  meals  for  the selected dates.  Also, print the Menu Scaled Recipes Report this will print recipes for the date and meal selected scaled to the amount required in the menus. (T-3). 6.1.2.  (Manual)  Production Planning.  The Production Worksheet Report (Computrition) is normally  used  to  perform  production  planning.    If  Computrition  or  computer  systems  are down, temporarily perform manual production planning (forecast food production needs for the  meals  in  the  cycle  menu,  establish  a  food  use  monitoring  system,  and  communicate instructions to food production personnel in the planning, preparing, cooking and serving of meals)  according  to  local  procedures.  (T-3).    Facilities  with  inpatient  feeding  only  should establish an alternate method of creating an audit trail for food use, AF Form 543, Food Issue Record,  menus  and  tally  sheets.    If  the  NM  cash  register  does  not  have  the  capability  of inputting patient meal counts, menu items served to patients and the total number of servings provided  to  patients  must  be  documented  according  to  local  procedures.  (T-3).    The  tally sheet  for  patient  meals  and  late  trays,  to  include  therapeutic  menus,  should  also  be  tracked and recorded according to local procedures. 6.2.  Purchasing Non-Food Supplies. 6.2.1.  Items  for  Patient  Tray  Service.    Establish  local  operating  procedures  to  request  and purchase  nonfood  supplies  needed  for  patient  tray  service,  dining  facility  operations,  food production,  and  sanitation.  (T-3).    These  procedures  must  reflect  types  of  items  needed, amounts  used,  replacement  factors,  stock  levels,  and  delivery  times.  (T-3).    Prepackaged flatware sets and dining packets containing straw, napkin and condiments (sugar, salt, pepper and sugar substitute) are allowed and are ordered by NM as supply items. (T-3). 6.2.2.  Enteral  Formulas  and  other  Medical  Foods,  and  Infant  Formulas.  See  Chapter  5, Section 5.10 for information on purchasing these items. 6.3.  Food Portion and Waste Control. 6.3.1.  Standardized recipes, serving utensils, and dishes are used to control portions, quality, and cost of food served. (T-3).  Foods should be cooked progressively, in small amounts as needed to  help  ensure a  fresher, more acceptable product.   This  practice  also  results in  less waste  by  cooking  only  what  is  needed  as  it  is  needed.    NM  production  managers  should periodically  observe  plate  waste  in  the  dish  room  from  dining  facility  service  and  patient   32  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 trays to evaluate patient’s consumption related to food quality, taste, portion control, quantity prepared and acceptability. 6.4.  Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP)  HACCP is the prevention-based food service safety system that must be used in NM.  HACCP systems are designed to prevent the occurrence of potential food safety problems.  HACCP involves seven principles. 6.4.1.  Analyze  hazards.    Potential  food-related  hazards  and  measures  to  control  potential hazards are identified.  (T-0).  The hazard could be biological, such as a microbe; chemical, such as a toxin; or physical, such as ground glass or metal fragments. 6.4.2.  Identify critical control points. (T-0).  These are points in a food's production, from its raw  state  through  processing  and  shipping  to  consumption  by  the  consumer,  at  which  the potential  hazard  can  be  controlled  or  eliminated.    Examples  are  cooking,  cooling,  and packaging. 6.4.3.  Establish  preventive  measures  with  critical  limits  for  each  control  point.  (T-0).    For example, for a cooked food this might include setting the minimum cooking temperature and time required to ensure the elimination of any harmful microbes. 6.4.4.  Establish  procedures  to  monitor  the  critical  control  points.  (T-0).    Such  procedures might  include  determining  how  and  by  whom  cooking  time  and  temperature  should  be monitored. 6.4.5.  Establish corrective actions to take when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been  met.  (T-0).    For  example,  reprocessing  or  disposing  of  food  if  the  minimum  cooking temperature is not met. 6.4.6.  Establish  procedures  to  verify  that  the  system  is  working  properly--for  example, testing  time-and-temperature  recording  devices  to  verify  that  a  cooking  unit  is  working properly.  (T-0). 6.4.7.  Establish  effective  record  keeping  documenting  the  HACCP  system.  (T-0).    This would  include  records  of  hazards  and  their  control  methods,  the  monitoring  of  safety requirements and action taken to correct potential problems. 6.4.8.  Food  Temperatures.  NM  personnel  complete  AF  Form  2582,  Food  Temperature Chart,  or  local  equivalent,  before  and  during  each  meal  to  ensure  foods  are  served  at appropriate  temperatures  IAW  the  AFMAN  48-147_IP,  Tri-Service  Food  Code.  (T-0).  Foods at other than optimal temperatures must be reheated or chilled as appropriate. (T-0). thermometer inside the  unit  which  can  be  viewed 6.4.9.  Storing  Subsistence  Items.    Subsistence  storage  rooms  and  refrigerators/freezers MUST  remain  locked  at  all  times  when  not  in  use.  (T-0).    Entry  for  all  but  authorized personnel  must  be  prohibited.  (T-0).    NM  refrigerators  should  have  the  following:    an accurate the refrigerator/freezer, a temperature chart to record readings taken at specific times IAW local guidance  unless  centrally  monitored  by  Facilities  Management,  a  warning  sign  such  as “Determine No One is Inside Before Locking,” a safety lock release that lets the door open from  inside  when  externally  locked,  an  electric  light  preferably  mounted  overhead  with  a glass-dome  bulb  protector  and  a  grid-type  metal  cover,  and  a  sign  indicating  the  type  of food(s) stored within and the required temperature range IAW the AFMAN 48-147_IP, Tri-Service Food Code. from  outside AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   33  6.5.  Sanitation and Infection Control.  Sanitation and Infection Control.  Refer to AFI 48-116, Food Safety Program, AFMAN 48-147_IP, Tri-Service Food Code, AFI 48-117, Public Facility Sanitation, and AFI 44-108, Infection Prevention and Control Program, for NM sanitation and infection  control  policies.    Limit  access  to  food  preparation  and  service  areas  by  unauthorized personnel.    NM  personnel  performing  dishwashing  duties  must  always  wear  gloves  as  a protective device against possible infections or contamination. (T-3).   6.6.  Patient  Tray  Assembly.  Patient  trays  are  assembled  using  a  centralized  food  service, which  places  all  food  service  workers  under  the  supervision  of  the  NM  officer  or  diet  therapy supervisor.  (T-3).    Using  the  right  patient  tray  service  system  aids  in  the  appropriate  use  of employees  assigned.    The  size  of  the  medical  treatment  facility  determines  the  type  of  patient tray assembly system used.   6.6.1.  Heated  Base  With  Enclosed  Pellet  System.    Larger  MTFs  use  the  heated  base  with enclosed pellet system. (T-3).  This system can also be used to augment the hot and cold cart system used in smaller facilities, if the tray carts cannot maintain a high enough temperature for hot foods. 6.6.2.  Hot and Cold Tray Cart System.  The hot and cold tray cart systems are typically used at smaller facilities due to reduced labor requirements.  One person can prepare all trays and additional personnel are needed only to deliver trays to patient inpatient units.  If an MTF's number of operational beds would normally dictate using a hot/cold food cart system, but the contingency plan calls for an expansion capacity making the heated base with pellet system desirable, retain and use the heated base with enclosed pellets system and conveyor belt. 6.6.3.  Insulated  Stacking  Trays  System.  The  Insulated  Stacking  Tray  System  is  generally used at small facilities that are supported by base food service. 6.6.4.  Point of Service Trolley/Cart System. This system is intended for cook-serve meals to be plated on the patient care units by food service workers.  Food service workers will obtain meal  orders  from  patients  at  the  bedside  and  then  plate  the  food  from  a trolley/cart  outside the room.  The trolley/cart typically has heated wells and refrigeration compartments to keep foods at proper temperature.  This system is designed to cater to patient food preferences at mealtimes.   34  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 Chapter 7 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 7.1.  Budgets.  The  purpose  of  an  operations  and  maintenance  budget  is  to  plan  for  the expenditure of funds in a manner that meets mission objectives within financial limitations.  The budget planning process requires time and effort to ensure sufficient funds are available for NM operations.    The  MTF  budget  cycle  usually  begins  a  few  months  before  the  start  of  the  fiscal year.    NM  operating  budgets  are  developed  to  include  projections  for  supplies,  equipment purchases  and  maintenance  costs,  and  required  travel.    To  develop  an  operating  budget  the following steps are followed: 7.1.1.  Collect  data, to  include the previous  year’s budget,  actual expenses for the last  year, projections for new programs or services, inflation rate, and workload trends. (T-3). 7.1.2.  Compare  data:  Analyze  last  year’s  budget  versus  expenditures,  and  reasons  for variation. (T-3). 7.1.3.  Compile data: Obtain current  cost data for equipment  and supplies, projected supply usage,  anticipating  needs  in  all  NM  areas,  including  educational  materials.  (T-3).    Obtain input from key NM personnel. (T-3). 7.1.4.  Draft the budget: Determine annual and quarterly costs. (T-3). 7.2.  Prime  Vendor.  Prime  Vendor  is  a  concept  of  support  whereby  a  single  commercial distributor  serves  as  the  major  provider  of  products  to  various  federal  customers  within  a geographical  region  or  zone.    The  vendor  supplies  commercially  available  subsistence  items under a contractual agreement established by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). 7.2.1.  NM  personnel  must  have  a  thorough  knowledge  of  their  Prime  Vendor  contract, especially renewal timeframes. (T-3).  Prime Vendor contracts are developed by DSCP in a number of steps called the acquisition process.  NM communication throughout  this process for generating new or renewing existing contracts is essential ensure specific NM subsistence purchasing needs are met.   Further information  on establishing Prime Vendor contracts  can be found in the DSCP Prime Vendor Manual available on the DSCP website. 7.2.2.  NM  must  communicate  to  DSCP  specific  subsistence  needs  such  as  low-fat  dairy products, special bread items, ice cream novelties and any dietetic items  (low sodium, low-fat,  sugar-free).  (T-3).    NM  must  detail  what  is  unique  to  its  operation  and  the  support needed. (T-3).  Any special requests or unusually large orders must be communicated to the vendor.  (T-3).    Problems  with  vendors  should  be  reported  to  DSCP  for  resolution,  after reasonable attempts to arrive at settlement have occurred with the vendor.  Communication in writing  with  DSCP  on  vendor’s  performance,  both  positive  and  negative,  is  essential  in determining  continuing  contracts  or  future  awards.    Vendors  must  communicate  with  NM and  DSCP  representatives  during  all  phases  of  the  contract  award  process.  (T-3).    It  is  the prime vendor’s responsibility to communicate his  terms  not  only to  DSCP but  also  to  NM. (T-3).  The Contractor Representative must be accessible to NM and the vendor’s customer service  must  be  available  and  easily  reached  by  phone.  (T-0).    Vendor  communication  and the  level  of  service  should  be  the  same  with  government  customers  as  it  is  with  all  others.  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   35  DSCP is responsible for explaining the contract and identifying the customer’s requirements.  DSCP  is  responsible  for  communications  with  all  parties  during  the  acquisition  process.  DSCP  must  act  as  the  customers’  advocate  in  communicating  with  the  vendors  and  must require vendors to adhere to the conditions and terms of the contract. 7.3.  Financial  Accountability.  The  duties  of  personnel  purchasing  subsistence  will  be separated from the duties of personnel completing ration accounting so that no one individual is responsible  for  both  originating  data  (source  records)  and  inputting/processing  data.  (T-3).  Therefore,  individuals  who  issue  food  will  not  be  authorized  to  close  verify  or  issue/return documents  to  the  official  inventory.  (T-3).    Storeroom  personnel  will  not  be  responsible  for completing the NM Accounting Spreadsheet. (T-3). 7.4.  Subsistence  Purchasing.  NM  will  purchase  subsistence  through  DSCP  or  DVA  prime vendor  contracts  and  local  direct  delivery  contracts.  (T-0).    Small  facilities  with  limited  NM operations  may  use  Government  Purchase  Card  (GPC)  accounts  to  purchase  subsistence  items needed for patient feeding.  The cost of food purchased is charged to the medical sub-account of 04(X), Essential Station Messing (ESM), Military Personnel Appropriation. (Example: 5703500 320 48 562 525725).  The correct ESM accounting classification number is updated annually and is  effective  1  October.  A  letter  from  the  Air  Force  Services  Activity  (AFSVA),  coordinated through  the  AF  SG  Consultant  Dietitian/BSC  Associate  Chief  for  Dietetics,  and  distributed  to MAJCOMs and MTFs indicates the updated ESM account classification number. 7.4.1.  Subsistence orders are submitted according to locally established procedure. (T-3). 7.4.2.  Subsistence  acceptance  authority  is  assigned  to  NM.  (T-3).    NM  must  designate individuals  authorized  to  accept  or  reject  subsistence  or  supplies  delivered  under  prime vendor programs or other DSCP contracts. (T-3). 7.4.2.1.  Designated  personnel  should  verify  the  hard  copy  purchase  order  with  the vendor  invoice  from  the  driver.    Ensure  that  products  received  match  those  ordered  at time  of  receipt  so  that  the  vendor’s  delivery  ticket  may  be  annotated  with  any discrepancies. (T-3).  When discrepancies are detected upon receipt, the vendor’s invoice will  be  annotated  to  indicate  actual  quantities  received  by  striking  through  the  listed quantity and entering the received quantity and reasons for the differences (i.e., damaged, short quantity, missing, substitution, high temperature, etc.). (T-3).  These changes must also be made in STORES before the STORES receipt is sent for payment.  (T-3).  If the vendor  substitutes  more  expensive  food  items,  NM  personnel  should  follow  procedures outlined in the prime vendor contract for resolution.  The individual making the change should  initial  all  corrections  to  the  distributor’s  invoice.    The  carrier’s  representative should sign the invoice when such corrections are made.  Any invoice changes must be verified with prime vendor.  When discrepancies are detected after receipt confirmation, NM personnel should phone the distributor’s customer representative to request a one for one replacement for the discrepant quantity. 7.4.2.1.1.  Invoices must reflect only items/quantities accepted and signed for by the NM receiving official. (T-3). 7.4.2.1.2.  Invoices must be receipted through STORES DLA. (T-3).   36  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 7.4.2.1.3.  STORES  receipt  prices  must  be  used  to  upload  data  into  Computrition (Vendor receipts are used to verify items and quantity of items received, but vendor prices are not used). (T-3). 7.4.2.1.4.  Check each function in the billing chain: NM storeroom personnel, DSCP or  VA  Account  Manager  and  Contract  Specialist,  and  Prime  Vendor  Billing Department,  to  make  sure  all  codes  and  billing/accounting  information  are  correct. (T-3). 7.4.2.1.4.1.  Billing  errors  may  result  from  many  causes:    invalid  Department  of Defense  Activity  Address  Code  (DODAAC),  incorrect  Military  Standard Requisitioning and  Issue Procedure  (MILSTRIP) profile, TAC 3 billing address, and/or ESM accounting classification. 7.4.2.1.4.2.  The DODAAC is the unique code that identifies the NM activity.  All NM  activities  must  have  a  DODAAC  beginning  with  "FT"  and  followed  by  a four-digit  number.    Codes  with  other  two-letter  prefixes,  such  as  "FB”  or  "FM” are  incorrect.    Questions  or  concerns  about  this  code  should  be  referred  to  the MAJCOM Dietitian. 7.4.2.1.4.3.  MILSTRIP PROFILES are the “ship to” address for delivering food. The  NM  MILSTRIP  profile  must  be  current  in  the  DSCP  system  for  proper billing and payment. 7.4.2.1.5.  Each  month  the  SF  1080,  Voucher  for  Transfers  Between  Appropriations and/or  Funds,  will  be  verified.  (T-0).    The  SF  1080  is  obtained  from  DFAS-JDCBB/CO-EBS (Address:  Defense Finance and Accounting Service; Attn:  DFAS-JDCBB/CO-EBS;  P.O.  Box  182204;  Columbus,  OH    43218-2204).    Any  billing errors are corrected through the DSCP account manager.  Procedures to verify the SF 1080  may  vary  from  base  to  base.    Each  base  must  coordinate  with  their  DSCP account manager to determine the correct method.  The typical method is as follows:  The  SF  1080  will  be  verified  with  Computrition  reports  and  vendor  receipts.  (T-1).  At  the  end  of  each  month,  the  NM  accountant  or  NCOIC  will  compare  the  amount disbursed by DFAS to the amount of subsistence purchased as shown on the invoices. (T-0).  This is accomplished by comparing the total subsistence purchases recorded in Computrition  with  total  disbursements  for  the  month.    Each  invoice  paid  will  be verified  and  marked  if  accurate  payment  was  made.  (T-0).    A  Memorandum  for Record will be attached to the report indicating invoices from previous months paid during the current month and an annotation made by invoices to be paid in the next month.    Any  discrepancies  in  amounts  reimbursed  by  DFAS  or  invoices  not  paid within two months will be submitted in a letter format to the regional DFAS office for correction. (T-0).  NOTE: Throughout the month the accountant may want to record each  invoice  number  and  dollar  value  to  facilitate  reconciliation  at  the  end  of  the month.    Invoices  must  reflect  only  items/quantities  accepted  and  signed  for  by  the NM receiving official. 7.4.3.  The  subsistence  GPC  card  in  NM  activities  will  be  used  for  the  purchase  of subsistence  items  only.  (T-3).    This  card  is  not  authorized  for  any  other  purchases.  Items other than subsistence to support the preparation or serving of foods may not  be purchased with this card.  The government purchase card can typically only be used to purchase items AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   37  from  DeCA.  The  NM  government  purchase  card  is  for  urgent  clinically  driven  nutritional requirements.  Urgent purchases include foods for patient feeding when these foods are not available  through  the  prime  vendor  or  DECA.    If  they  are  available  through  the  prime vendor,  then  the  prime  vendor  must  be  used.    The  GPC  cannot  be  used  to  purchase subsistence  from  any  other  local  sources  unless  approved  by  Corporate  Food  Service  with coordination with the Deputy Assistant Secretary Financial Operations. 7.4.3.1.  Contact  the  base  contracting  office  and  request  the  GPC  Procurement  Program Cardholder and Approving Official Account Set-Up Information application forms. Each cardholder and each approving official must complete an application form.  For address, use  the  duty  section  address.    Submit  a  letter  of  request  for  GPC  card  listing  all individuals  responsible  for  subsistence  procurement.    Identify  the  primary  approving official  as  well  as  all  designated  alternates.    All  cardholders  will  receive  monthly statements  of  their  account  activity.    The  approving  officials  can  view  a  monthly summary statement on line.  The approving official will not be a cardholder. (T-3). 7.4.3.2.  Each cardholder must maintain a GPC account documentation binder IAW AFI 64-117, Air Force Government-Wide Purchase Card Program. (T-3). 7.5.  Unauthorized  Uses  of  Subsistence  Items.  MTF  staff  and  visitors  are  not  authorized  to consume unused trays, leftover food, or nourishments on inpatient care units. (T-3).  Food items purchased  for  use  by  NM  activities  will  not  be  issued  or  given  to  the  Pharmacy  or  nursing service  for  making  medications  or  coloring  tube  feedings.  (T-3).    Food  items  for  blood  sugar testing,  gastric  emptying  studies,  etc.  are  purchased  through  their  respective  departments.  Pharmacy, nursing service and any other departments may purchase necessary subsistence items, such as sugar, baking soda, cornstarch, or food  coloring from  DeCA or other vendors via their own  GPC  accounts.    Nonfood  items  such  as  charcoal  and  lighter  fluid  for  NM  theme  meals should be purchased with NM supply funds. (T-3).  Subsistence funds and food items purchased with  subsistence  funds  are  not  used  for  guest  meals,  snacks,  coffee  breaks,  cooking demonstrations, parties of any type, blood donor or health promotion programs.  Food items for health promotion activities are purchased via separate health promotion GPC accounts. (T-3).  If food  items  for  blood  donor  or  health  promotion  programs  are  purchased  by  other  departments and  are  stored  in  NM,  they  will  not  be  posted,  included  in  the  NM  subsistence  inventory,  or physically  located  with  other  subsistence.  (T-3).    These  items  will  be  controlled,  specially marked, and used only in support of the programs for which they were purchased. (T-3). 7.6.  Perpetual  Inventory.  The  Storeroom  Manager  is  responsible  for  keeping  the  perpetual inventory  system  of  subsistence  stock  records  and  source  documents  for  subsistence  purchases and  issues.  (T-3).    Entries  include  vendor  receipts  and  purchase  invoices,  GPC  statements  and receipts, or AF Forms 543, Food Issue Record. 7.6.1.  (Automated)  .  Access  the  Computrition  online  user  manual  for  appropriate procedures by pressing F1 while logged into Computrition. (T-3). 7.6.2.  (Manual)  . AF Form 542, Subsistence Stock Record, is used to maintain a perpetual inventory of all food items in the storeroom. (T-3). 7.7.  Physical Inventory. 7.7.1.  A  physical  inventory  is  performed  each  month  on  one  of  the  last  three  normal  duty days and is representative as of the date of the inventory (with the exception of FY close-out   38  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 when  the  inventory  is  performed  on  the  last  duty  day  of  the  month).  (T-3).    Pre-pulled subsistence to be used for the weekend through the last calendar day must be issued on the actual  day  used.    Any  inventory  adjustment  is  to  be  posted  to  AF  Form  546,  Food  Cost Record,  or  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet  as  of  the  date  of  inventory.  (T-3).    Post  the remaining days of the month and close out the AF Form 546 or NM Accounting Spreadsheet on the last day of the month.  The FY close-out in September should be conducted on the last day of the fiscal year when possible; otherwise, it is taken on the last duty day and the above procedures followed for closing out the account. 7.7.2.  The  MTF  Commander  or  designee  appoints  a  disinterested  person  (officer  or noncommissioned officer in grades E-7 or above) to perform a physical inventory of all food items.  (T-3).    The  inventory  officer  must  be  trained  on  their  responsibilities  and  inventory procedures.  (T-3).    This  training  should  include  directions  on  using  the  wall-to-wall inventory  method  (shelf-by-shelf,  top  to  bottom)  to  count  and  record  the  total  quantity  of each item on hand.  A NM representative will assist the inventory officer.  The storeroom is closed and no food issues are made until the inventory is completed. (T-3).  Any food issues made after the inventory are dated for the following day. (T-3).  A physical count is taken of each  unissued  food  item  on  the  inventory  listing  obtained  from  Computrition.  (T-3).    The inventory  officer  delivers  the  completed  and  signed  inventory  listing  to  the  Commander’s Support Staff and NM Officer/NCOIC.  (T-3). 7.7.3.  Inventory  Certification.  After  the  inventory  is  done,  the  inventory  officer  and  NM inventory representative sign the following statement on the last page of the inventory listing: "I certify this physical count of inventory is correct." (T-3). 7.7.4.  If  the  physical  count  and  the  inventory  records  do  not  agree,  attempt  to  recount  the item(s)  and  reconcile  the  differences  using  purchase  invoices,  issue  logs,  GPC  receipts, and/or  Computrition  reports.  (T-3).    When  differences  cannot  be  reconciled,  an  Inventory Adjustment Report is prepared. (T-3). 7.7.4.1.  Inventory Adjustment Report. When approved, this report is a valid accounting document  used  to  adjust  discrepancies  found  during  a  regularly  scheduled  inventory.  NM will keep a copy of the approved report. (T-3). 7.7.4.1.1.  The MSA officer and NM Accountant prepares the  Inventory  Adjustment Report  from  the  costed  inventory  listing  to  show  actual  overages  and  shortages  by item  and  the  net  total  monetary  adjustment.  It  must  also  show  the  total  value  of  all subsistence  issued  since  the  last  inventory  and  the  value  of  one  half  of  one  percent (0.005)  of  that  total.    NM  Storeroom  personnel  are  not  authorized  to  prepare  this report. (T-3). 7.7.4.1.2.  NM  submits  the  report  to  the  squadron  commander,  who  is  authorized  to approve net dollar discrepancies of not more than one-half of one percent (0.005) of the total dollar value of food used since the last inventory. (T-3).  Food items that are not  approved  for  adjustment  by  the  squadron  commander  as  well  as  losses  or damages due to other than normal NM operations (fire or theft) may require Report of Survey action by the commander. 7.7.5.  Inventory Control. At the end of each quarter and the fiscal  year, the dollar value of the closing inventory, as reported on AF Form 541, Nutritional Medicine Service Subsistence AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   39  Cost  Report,  or  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet,  will  be  between  15  and  30  percent  of  the cumulative average monthly cost of food used for the fiscal year to date. (T-3).  MTFs using Prime Vendor for subsistence will reduce inventory levels to 2-3 days’ supply, or not more than 15 to 30 percent of the cumulative average monthly cost of food used for the fiscal year to date. (T-3).  Optimal inventory levels must be determined locally to ensure that adequate food  is  on  hand/available  in  case  of  disaster  or  emergency  situations  when  deliveries  are likely  to  be  disrupted.    (T-3).      Additionally,  it  is  important  to  review  cumulative  (versus exclusively quarterly) dollar value of the closing inventory to meet monetary standards at FY close out. 7.7.5.1.  Additionally  OCONUS  locations  may  have  special  circumstance  that  preclude strict adherence to a closing inventory value of 15-30 percent, secondary to varying costs and  transportation  time,  depending  on  availability  and  location  of  the  prime  vendor utilized. 7.8.  Closing  a  NM  Activity.  No  less  than  four  months  prior  to  closing,  start  dropping  the inventory level to below the 25 percent level. (T-3).  Adapt menus to use food in stock instead of purchasing  more  food.  (T-3).    Gradually  drop  the  inventory  level  so  that  two  months  prior  to closure,  the  inventory  level  is  approximately  15  percent.    At  closure,  transfer  the  last  bit  of inventory to other base dining facilities. (T-3). 7.9.  Issuing Subsistence. 7.9.1.  (Automated)  Items  are  issued  in  Computrition.  (T-3).    Access  the  Computrition online  user  manual  for  appropriate  procedures  by  pressing  F1  while  logged  into Computrition. 7.9.2.  (Manual)  AF Form 543 is used to issue food supplies manually. Once able to access Computrition,  transcribe  all  information.    AF  Form  543  is  a  source  document  used  by  the MSA  officer  and  NM  storeroom  personnel  to  maintain  the  official  perpetual  inventory  of food items.  Storeroom personnel complete AF Form 543 for each day of the week and issue direct delivery items on the day they are received.  Perishable fresh fruits and vegetables may be  issued  the  day  of  purchase  and  receipt.    High  volume,  low-cost  items  may  be  issued  as needed  each  day,  or  for  a  longer  use  period.    Food  items  being  issued  should  be  listed  by food  groups  or  some  other  internal  order  on  the  form  to  expedite  issuing,  posting,  pricing, and receiving. 7.9.2.1.  The person receiving the food items from the storeroom counts and verifies food received and signs the form in the “received” block. (T-3).  If more food items are issued than needed, return to inventory under “returned” column of form. 7.9.2.2.  No  later  than  the  day  following  issue  of  food,  post  issues  to  AF  Form  542 writing the balance of the item issued in column 1 as the item is posted, and the signed forms are reviewed and checked by NM management. MSA office gets the original and a copy; NM keeps a copy. (T-3). 7.9.2.3.  The MSA office cost-extends the two copies of AF Form 543 marking column 2 of  the  form  as  each  item  is  posted.    One  copy  of  the  cost-extended  form  is  returned  to NM for review and filing.   40  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 7.9.2.4.  The  MSA  office  retains  on  file  the  original  cost-extended  form  and  returns  the duplicate to NM for filing.  NM retains the file for three years for audit purposes. (T-3). 7.10.  Costing  Subsistence  Items.  All  MTFs  use  the  Last-In  First-Out  (LIFO)  costing  method for recording purchases and costing items. (T-3).  With this method, the value of the inventory is based on the last purchase price of each line item and as food items are purchased, the new unit price, if applicable, is used to re-value the entire balance of that line item in the inventory.  This practice  is  designed  into  the  automated  system.    (Note:  First-In  First-Out  is  still  the  preferred method for rotating food items.) 7.11.  Excess  Cost.  Excess  Costs  are  feeding  costs  that  exceed  the  monetary  allowance authorized  for  individual  food  components  or  needs.   Examples  of  situations  where reimbursements  are  authorized  include:  use  of  operational  rations  (the  cost  of  the  operational ration that exceeds actual earnings), substituted food items, unsatisfactory subsistence (spoilage upon  delivery),  beverages  for  medical  readiness  exercises,  and  lost  meals  due  to  disaster  or exercise  situations.    These  credits  are  not  added  to  earnings,  but  rather  subtracted  from  issues. (T-3).    The  resulting  dollar  amount,  Food  Served,  is  used  to  calculate  monetary  status.  (T-3).  Monetary  credit  is  taken  and  annotated  on  the  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet  in  the  excess  cost column;  this  is  calculated  into  the  earnings  minus  issues.    The  dollar  value  of  issues  will  not reflect any cost of subsistence items that were credited. (T-3). 7.11.1.  The NM officer or diet therapy supervisor prepares a statement to support the other income (credit), including the date and hour of the disaster, combat mission or field, alert or medical  readiness  exercise.    Certification  of  this  statement  is  required  by  the  MTF Commander. (T-3). 7.12.  Cashier  Operations.  Separation  of  financial  duties  and  responsibilities  in  authorizing, processing, recording and receiving cash transactions is essential to prevent loss of funds.  NM must develop a local instruction to detail how cashiering and accounting duties are separated so as to establish adequate internal controls to prevent theft and abuse. (T-3). 7.12.1.  Change Fund. DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol 5, Disbursing Policy and Procedures,  Chapter 3, Keeping and Safeguarding Public Funds, authorizes and states how the NM Officer requests a change fund. 7.12.2.  Cash Control. For A la Carte (ALACS) operations, a cash control supervisor must be designated in  writing. An adequate funds storage safe must be available to  hold  the change fund, cash sales, and controlled forms.  (T-3). 7.12.2.1.  AF Form 2570, Nutritional Medicine Service Cash and Forms Receipt, is used to issue the cash drawer, and AF IMT 79, Headcount Record, to the cashier as required.  The same AF Form 2570 is used by the cashier to return the cash drawer, cash collected, and AF IMT 79 to the cash control officer after the meal. (T-3).  Discrepancies are also noted on AF IMT 79. (T-3). 7.12.3.  Control of signature and cash collection forms and cash.  The cash control supervisor indicates funds and controlled forms (AF IMT 79) for turn in to MSA using AF Form 1305, Receipt for Transfer of Cash and Vouchers, for cash collected and AF Form 1254, Register of  Cash  Collection  Sheets,  for  controlled  forms  used  to  document  the  transfer  of responsibility from NM to MSA. (T-3).  If the forms used vary by installation, comply with local policies. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   41  7.12.3.1.  The AF IMT 79 is a controlled form used to obtain the signatures of all persons who  eat  in  NM  dining  facilities  at  government  expense  (i.e.,  ESM),  except  inpatients.  The  AF  IMT  79  is  also  used  to  collect  and  record  all  funds  of  cash  paying  customers.  The  designated  NM  representative,  who  must  be  a  government  employee,  keeps  a separate file of completed AF IMT 79 forms in numerical order by serial number.  This file  must  be  physically  checked  at  least  once  each  month  to  see  that  all  forms  are accounted for by number. (T-3).  No two AF IMT 79 forms bear the same number in the same fiscal  year.  All numbered and unused forms must be kept in a locked safe. (T-3).  The MSA clerk furnishes the NM representative as many numbered AF IMT 79 forms as may be required.  The AF IMT 79 forms issued to NM are tracked on AF Form 1254 by MSA.  (T-3).    Completed  AF  IMT  79  forms  are  turned  in  by  the  NM  cash  control supervisor by listing the serial  numbers on the same AF  Form  1305 used to  turn in  AF IMT 79 forms and cash to MSA. 7.12.4.  Cash and Forms turn in to MSA. All cash collected and AF IMT 79 forms used must be  turned  in  to  the  MSA  office  daily,  excluding  weekends.  (T-3).    However,  if  the  storage limit  on  the  safe/funds  storage  container  is  inadequate  to  support  the  amount  of  cash collected  over  a  2  or  3  day  weekend,  make  arrangements  with  the  MSA  office  to  turn  in excess  cash  to  the  MSA  office  during  the  weekend  period,  or  request  an  increase,  through Finance, in the amount of funds the safe/funds storage container can store. 7.12.4.1.  Cash  deposit  paperwork  (AF  Form  544,  Nutritional  Medicine  Daily  Facility Summary  Report,  AF  Form  1305,  and  AF  Form  2570)  must  be  done  on  a  daily  basis, even if the money must be held over the weekend. (T-3). 7.12.5.  ALACS  Cash  Register  Operations.  Cash  registers  are  used  with  the  capacity  to identify ESM diners by their last four social security numbers; record meal charges; produce daily  cumulative  reports  of  total  charges  to  each  social  security  number;  calculate  discount and  standard  meal  prices;  receive  cash;  record  diner  head  count  by  category,  including transient  patients,  inpatients  eating  in  the  dining  facility,  and  second  servings  from  ESM customers;  produce  both  patient  and  dining  facility  food  consumption  reports;  and  record totals  for  Food  Service  Operating  Expenses  collected.    Care  must  be  taken  that  the  cash registers  are  correctly  programmed  to  both  calculate  and  charge  cash  patrons  the  standard, with surcharge rate as well as the discount rate, and correctly total the surcharges from each meal period.  See section 6.13. ALACS Recipe Pricing Operations, for additional information on standard and discount rates. 7.12.5.1.  The DoD subsistence surcharge (operating expense) is proportionately divided between  the  AF  Military  Personnel  Appropriation  (MPA)  and  the  Defense  Health Program  (DHP)  O&M appropriation based on the percentage of the MTF dining hall’s military and civilian manpower authorizations (per the Unit Manning Document).  MTF military personnel are funded by the AF MPA and civilians are funded by the DHP O&M appropriation.  MTF MSA officers will proportionately divide the surcharge accordingly with the start of each FY. (T-3).  For example, if the FY surcharge collected is $100 and the  MTF  dining  hall  manpower  authorizations  are  three  military  and  seven  civilian personnel,  then  the  proportionate  amount  to  deposit  to  MPA  is  $30  and  the  amount  to deposit to the DHP O&M is $70 (e.g., out of 10 employees, 30 percent are military and 70 percent are civilian, therefore $100 would be divided respectively).   42  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 7.12.5.2.  Cash  register  maintenance  contracts  are  established  and  adequate  supplies  of tapes and ribbons are procured locally through Medical Logistics. (T-3). 7.12.5.3.  Cashiers must offer all customers a receipt for their purchases. (T-3). 7.12.6.  Subsistence  Credit  Allowance  Management  System  (SCAMS)  Cashier  Operations. In  SCAMS  operations,  all  diners  in  a  government  dining  facility,  except  ambulatory  and transient patients, sign for meals. The cashier verifies the diner's identification.  In overseas areas,  authorized  medical  facility  local  national  employees  will  pay  for  meals  according  to the  Status  of  Forces  Agreement  (SOFA)  for  that  country.  (T-0).    Local  disaster  plans  may address use of personal checks and/or lost meals due to disaster situations. 7.12.6.1.  Meal rates at appropriated fund facilities using SCAMS.  Meal rates at SCAMS facilities  are  established  by  the  Office  of  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  (Comptroller).  Meal rates are posted annually effective 1 January and can be downloaded from Tab G of the table, http://comptroller.defense.gov/rates/.   This  table also  describes who is  eligible for the standard or discount rate. Reimbursable Department Rates of Defense FY 7.12.6.2.  All non-ESM persons entering the dining facility must pay the posted price of the  meal  being  served,  regardless  of  the  type  of  meal  items  or  quantity  selected.  (T-3).  Some small volume feeding overseas facilities do not have cash registers and use the AF IMT 79, Headcount Record, to record patron meals.  Separate AF IMT 79 forms are used for cash and ESM diners. (T-3). 7.12.6.3.  The  cashier  ensures  the  AF  IMT  79  forms  are  completed  daily  for  each  meal period.  (T-3).    A  separate  AF  IMT  79  is  used  for  non-U.S.  citizen  civilian  employees overseas who are allowed to eat in the dining facility. (T-3).  Use a separate AF IMT 79 for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (T-3).  These forms will not be "carried over" from one meal to another.  Therefore, in facilities where an authorized change fund is allotted for both dollars and the local currency, three AF IMT 79 forms are issued per meal (one for meal card holders, one for dollars, and one for local currency). (T-3). 7.12.6.4.  Air  Force  Reserve  members  must  present  verification  of  eligibility  for  ESM meals  (reserve  active  duty  orders  or  AF  Form  40a,  Record  of  Individual  Inactive  Duty Training) while on active duty training or inactive duty for training, sign AF IMT 79 as required, and write their names and last four social security numbers legibly on the forms. (T-3).  NM will make a copy of the member’s orders and turn in copies to MSA with the AF IMT 79s for the day. (T-3).  AD and Reserve members who receive the subsistence portion of per diem are not authorized to subsist at government expense and must pay for their meals. (T-3).  When a guard or reserve unit member does not receive the subsistence portion of per diem, they do not pay for their meals, but instead sign a separate AF Form 79 (separated by unit). (T-3).  Note:  Billing may be required by MSA. 7.12.6.5.  After the meal, the NM supervisor verifies entries on the AF IMT 79, signs the form,  and  then  transfers  the  number  of  meals  for  each  different  category  onto  the appropriate  entries  in  the  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet  (automated)  and  AF  Form  544. (T-3). 7.12.6.6.  When  the  amount  of  cash  collected  varies  from  the  number  of  signatures  and total  amount  due,  the  supervisor  investigates  and  states  the  explanation  for  overages  or AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   43  shortages on AF  IMT 79. (T-3).   Include the name(s) of the cashier(s) during the meal. (T-3).  If no reason for the cash variance is apparent, state that there is no apparent reason for the cash variance. (T-3).  NMs should establish local policies and procedures to track cashier overages and shortages so corrective action or training can be initiated. 7.12.6.7.  The completed AF IMT 79 forms and collected cash are delivered to the MSA officer  at  least  once  each  normal  duty  day.    The  MSA  officer  will,  upon  receipt  of completed AF IMT 79 forms, and the cash from the NM cash control supervisor, verify the cash receipts against the total amount of cash received. (T-3). 7.12.6.8.  Small  volume  feeding  facilities  will  use  Computrition  to  track  inventory,  as well  as  all  purchases  and  requisitions.  (T-3).    The  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet (automated) is used to record daily earnings, issues, and purchases, as well as all relevant patient feeding activities (APV/SDS) and patient bed days. 7.12.6.8.1.  In the event  the computer systems  were down for  an extended period of time,  the  SCAMS  facility  would  utilize  standardized  AF  Form  processes  (i.e.,  AF Form  542,  AF  Form  543,  AF  Form  544,  and  AF  Form  541)  to  track  earnings  and issues until appropriate entries could be made in the NM Accounting Spreadsheet or Computrition, once automated operations resumed. (T-3). 7.13.  Eligibility  and  Identification  of  Diners.  DOD 1338.1 0-M, Manual for the Department of  Defense  Food  Service  Program,  AFI  41-115,  Authorized  Health  Care  and  Health  Care Benefits  in  the  Military  Health  Services  System,  and  AFH  41-114,  Military  Health  Services System Matrix, state who is eligible for medical care in AF medical facilities, prescribe the extent of care allowed, provide guidance for care, and delineate who pays standard and discount meal rates (see Attachment 3). Meal rates are published annually by the Office of Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller)  and  are  typically  released  by  HQ  USAF/SG3  to  resource  management officers in December, with an effective date of 1 January.  All meal rate prices must be posted at the  dining  facility  entrance  or  serving  areas.    All  MTF  staff  members  must  pay  for  all  food consumed. 7.13.1.  Transient  patient.  Transient  patients  in  the  aeromedical  evacuation  system  or  Non-Medical Attendants (NMAs) do not pay or sign for meals.  They are identified by the patient identification wristband or IAW local procedures.  A patient ceases to be a transient patient when  admitted  to  a  MTF.    The  number  of  transient  patients  at  each  meal  is  recorded  as  a Remain Over Night (RON) patient on the NM Accounting Spreadsheet (automated) and AF Form 544, Nutritional Medicine Daily Facility Summary Report (manual). (T-3).  Breakfast meals are calculated to receive .20 meal credit; lunch and dinner, .40 meal credit.  (T-3). 7.13.2.  Nonmedical  attendant  (NMA).  The  nonmedical  attendant  of  a  hospitalized  patient pays the appropriate charges for all meals consumed. 7.13.3.  Essential Station Messing (ESM). ESM diners are enlisted members authorized to eat at government expense. Medical enlisted personnel and airmen assigned to the MTF present their  DoD  Common  Access  Card  (CAC)  Identification  Card.  (T-3).    Enlisted  personnel  in TDY status must show valid orders and their DoD CAC Identification Card. (T-3).  Follow installation-specific guidance for identifying eligible personnel as appropriate. 7.13.3.1.  The OIC/NCOIC of NM validates ESM diners using last name and last four of Social  Security  Numbers  for  identification  and  spot  check  signature/cashier  records  to   44  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 ensure  that  only  authorized  personnel  are  subsisting  at  government  expense.  (T-3).    A current listing of ESM diners from the base Force Support Squadron should be received and reviewed at least monthly. 7.13.4.  Inpatients  and  ambulatory  procedures  visit  (APV)/same  day  surgery  (SDS). Inpatients  and  APV/SDS  patients  are  identified  by  nursing  staff  using  AF  Form  1094  or through the Essentris-Computrition interface.  (T-3). 7.13.5.  Outpatients. Outpatients in the MTF for treatment may purchase meals from vending machines or directly from NM as guests. 7.13.6.  Wounded  Warrior  (WW)  Meals.  In  accordance  with  the  National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009, section 602, MTFs provide meals at no cost (and no surcharge)  to  certain  injured  members  of  the  Armed  Forces  while  receiving  healthcare services  for  an  injury,  illness,  or  disease  incurred  in  support  of  OPERATION  IRAQI FREEDOM,  OPERATION  ENDURING  FREEDOM,  or  any  other  operation  or  area designated  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense.  (T-0).    Healthcare  services  include  medical recuperation or therapy or other continuous care as an inpatient or outpatient. 7.13.6.1.  Wounded Warriors (WW) will present DoD Form 714,  Meal Card, indicating that member is a WW entitled to a meal free of charge. (T-0).  In addition, WW’s must present CAC Military Identification Card. (T-3). 7.13.6.1.1.  For bases that do not have a local WW Liaison Office or Coordinator to issue  WW  meal  card  (DoD  Form  714,  Meal  Card),  NM  will  establish  a  local guidance to properly identify eligible WWs to help prevent fraud, waste and abuse of this privilege. (T-3). 7.13.6.2.  The  NM  cashier  will  process  the  WW’s  meal  at  no  cost  and  input  meal purchase into the cash register system IAW local procedures. (T-3). 7.13.6.3.  WW will sign a separate AF IMT 79 entitled, “Wounded Warrior”. (T-3).  AF IMT  79  will  include  at  a  minimum  WW  name,  rank,  unit  of  assignment,  and  contact information. (T-3). 7.13.6.4.  The number of WW meals  served will be entered daily  as a wounded warrior into the AF Accounting Spreadsheet. (T-3). 7.13.6.5.  A tally of total WW meals will be tracked on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet and  NM  will  provide  monthly  cost  and  service  summaries  per  local  guidance  obtained from AFSVA. (T-3). 7.13.6.6.  NM will advertise the WW meal program by posting the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Memorandum dated 4 February 2009 on bulletin board(s) in the  NM  department  visible  to  patrons.  (T-0).    The  memorandum  can  be  located  at http://www.tricare.mil/ocfo/_docs/20090204%20Permanent%20Waiver%20of%20Meal%20Surcharge.PDF. 7.13.7.  Non-admitted meals (NAMs).  This is a category of meal accounting for designated outpatients in the MTF.  The Diet Therapist will annotate on AF Form 2573, Weighted Diet Census.  (T-3).    Follow  local  infection  control  policy  when  providing  food  to  non-admitted patients. (T-3). AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   45  leave the  area 7.13.7.1.  Outpatients  in  the  MTF  for  treatment  (not  APV  or  SDS)  for  greater  than  4 hours (i.e. chemotherapy clinic, dialysis clinic, emergency room) who by virtue of their care  cannot to  obtain  food  or  beverage  may  be  provided nourishment/meals.    Meals/nourishments  provided  are  accounted  for  under  “non-admitted meals” on the accounting spreadsheet.  NAM eligible outpatients do not visit the dining facility to obtain a “free” meal.  The NDAA 2012 provision of food guidance can be http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf.    The  guidance  can  be  located  on  page  175,  section  704,  0178b (Provision  of  food  to  certain  members  and  dependents  not  receiving  inpatient  care  in military medical treatment facilities). found at: 7.13.7.2.  Parents (non-patients) who are required by the physician to stay on the pediatric inpatient unit to be with their child (the patient) may be served meals on the unit.  Meals are accounted for under “non-admitted meals” on the accounting spreadsheet. (T-3). 7.13.7.3.  Breastfeeding  mothers  (non-patients)  of  infants  admitted  to  the  hospital  may receive a tray in place of the infant.  Meal cost is tracked on the accounting spreadsheet in the “non-admitted meals” column. 7.13.7.4.  When  requesting  food  and  beverages  from  the  MTF’s  Food  Service Department it is important that: (1) communication is accomplished in a timely manner to take  care  of  the  patient’s  nutritional  needs,  (2)  dietary  restrictions  are  addressed  at  the time the order is placed, and (3) food and beverages are provided in a timely manner in accordance with the MTF’s routine food service procedures. 7.14.  ALACS  Recipe  Pricing  Operations.  In ALACS each recipe item  is  priced and sold  on an individual item  basis.  Computerized menu pricing  reports such as the Computrition Recipe Price Report must be available. (T-3).  Each recipe cost that is not available from these programs must be manually calculated, per DoD guidance:  When using an “a la carte” menu, the price of every item on the menu shall be established at 133 percent (surcharge) of the food cost (i.e., the cost of unprepared food multiplied by a factor of 1.33).  The following category of diners will be charged a discount price. (T-3).  This discount price is the menu cost minus the 33% surcharge. The discount rate shall not be charged to: (a) spouses and other dependents of enlisted personnel in pay grades E-1 through E-4. (b) members of organized nonprofit youth groups sponsored at either the national or local level and permitted to eat in the general dining facility by the Commanding Officer of the installation.  Such groups include: Civil Air Patrol, Junior ROTC and Scouting units. (c)  officers,  enlisted  members,  and  federal  civilian  employees  who  are  not  receiving  the  meal portion of per diem and who are either: (1) Performing duty on a U.S. Government vessel, (2) On field duty, (3) In a group travel status, or (4) Included in essential unit messing (EUM) as defined in the JFTR, Volume 1. (d) officers, enlisted members, and federal employees who are not receiving the meal portion of per diem, and who are on a U.S. Government aircraft on official duty either as a passenger or as a crew member engaged in flight operations. (e) officers, enlisted members, and federal employees on Joint Task Force operations other than training at temporary U.S. installations, or using temporary dining facilities.  In addition, when calculating the base menu item cost, an additional 20% condiment fee may be added to the basic cost per portion of all items served in appropriated fund food activities.  This   46  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 addition  is  intended  to  cover  condiments,  and  items  that  are  not  recipe  ingredients  (nonstick spray, fryer oil), and food preparation losses from spillage, burning, discarded, etc.  Ideally this variable percent  should  be adjusted per menu item.   As an example, if French  Fries cost  $0.50 per serving from the prime vendor, a 33% surcharge is  added.  In addition, since this is a non-ready-to-eat food (needs to be fried), a 20% condiment charge is added, making the cost to the patron $0.80.  Conversely, a pre-portioned ready-to-eat food item such as an 8 oz carton of milk should  have  a  surcharge  of  33%  (per  DoD  ALL  menu  items  are  assessed  surcharge)  and condiment additive of 0% since it is ready to eat. 7.14.1.  ALACS  facilities  are  encouraged  to  round  menu  item  prices  at  the  registers  to  the nearest $0.05. 7.15.  Special  Feeding  Circumstances.  Responsibilities  for  control  measures,  when  feeding under disaster and combat conditions or during field, alert, and medical readiness exercises, are the same as those under normal circumstances.  Personnel who receive monetary allowance for subsistence must pay for their meals, including paying for operational meals such as MREs.  In normal  NM  management  procedures  apply  during  disasters,  in  combat  areas,  and  during  field, alert or medical readiness exercises as often as possible.  Special cashier procedures may have to be instituted during disaster or emergency conditions.  The installation commander provides the MTF  Commander  with  a  statement  (verbal,  followed  in  writing)  that  emergency  or  disaster conditions  prevail  and  that  it  is  essential  to  furnish  food  to  persons  other  than  those  normally allowed.  (T-3).      Those  persons  able  to  pay  for  meals  sign  AF  IMT  79  if  required,  and  pay according to Attachment 3 of this Manual. (T-3).  Those persons unable to pay for meals sign a separate  AF  IMT  79.  (T-3).    The  diet  therapy  supervisor  or  other  specified  person  writes  the name  of  the  group  of  persons  being  fed  on  the  AF  IMT  79  above  the  title.  (T-3).    If  it  is  not feasible  to  obtain  signatures,  as  in  the  case  where  food  support  is  provided  to  another  civilian hospital, the NM officer certifies the number of meals  furnished on a separate AF  IMT 79 and includes the statement: “I certify that (number of meals) were provided to (the name hospital) in (location)  due  to  (situation,  such  as  hurricane)  for  (the  meal  period,  meal  date).”  (T-3).    The number of meals is included on AF Form 544 and NM Accounting Spreadsheet. (T-3).  Credit is taken  for  all  meals.  (T-3).    The  MSA  officer  and  NM  accountant  maintains  documentation  to prove  entries  on  AF  IMT  79  and  544  and  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet.  (T-3).    If  feasible,  the MSA officer bills the appropriate agency for the costs of meals provided. 7.16.  NM  Ration  Accounting.  For accurate NM financial reports, NM accounting parameters must  be  accurate  and  up  to  date,  whether  calculated  on  the  AF  Accounting  Spreadsheet  or manually.  (T-3). 7.16.1.  A ration is the quantity of nutritionally adequate food required to subsist or feed one person for one day. 7.16.2.  The Food Cost Index is a DoD prescribed list of food components and quantities that represent  the  allowance  for  fifty-five  standard  ration  food  items,  which  is  used  to  compute the Basic Daily Food Allowance (BDFA). (T-3). 7.16.3.  The BDFA is a prescribed quantity of food, as defined by components and monetary value, required to provide a nutritionally adequate diet for one person for one day. 7.16.3.1.  (Automated)  . The MTF BDFA is calculated monthly on the NM Accounting Spreadsheet  using  the  most  current  Food  Cost  Index.  (T-3).    The  BDFA  can  also  be AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   47  calculated  using  the  Joint  Culinary  Center  For  Excellence  Quartermaster  Website  at http://www.quartermaster.army.mil/jccoe/operations_directorate/quad/BDFA/bdfa_main.html.    The  template  built  into  the  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet  must  follow  the Food  Cost  Index  obtained  from  the  Defense  Logistics  Agency.  (T-3).    For  correct computation  of  this  allowance,  using  prime  vendor  contracts  or  DeCA,  the  exact subsistence items  referred to  by the National  Stock Number (NSN) need  to  be verified. (T-0).  When verifying items and calculating the BDFA, food substitutions may only be used  if  the  exact  food  item  listed  by  the  stock  number  is  unavailable  through  prime vendor. (T-3).  Even if the item is not used, if it is available, it must be priced for BDFA calculation.  Do not substitute higher cost items not intended for use to artificially raise the BDFA, and do not substitute higher cost items because of personal preference. (T-3). 7.16.4.  Patient  Basic  Daily  Food  Allowance  (Patient  BDFA)  is  the  MTF  BDFA  with  an added 15 percent  supplemental  allowance (Patient  Supplemental Percentage) to  help  defray the cost of bulk nourishments.  The Patient BDFA is only used to calculate patient meal day earnings.  Only one Patient BDFA applies for the full calendar month. 7.16.4.1.  (Automated)  Use NM Accounting Spreadsheet to compute Patient BDFA for patient meal days served each day. (T-3). 7.16.5.  Small  Volume  Feeding  Allowance/Percentage.  NM  activities  using  SCAMS  and serving  less  than  100  average  daily  meal  days  for  both  patient  and  dining  facility  patron rations are authorized an additional supplemental allowance of 15 percent of the MTF BDFA in order to adjust for the increased costs of feeding a smaller number of people. (T-3).  This eligibility  is  determined  at  the  end  of  each  month  using  the  previous  months  average  daily meal  days,  and  is  applied  to  ESM  and  SCAMS  dining  facility  patrons  only.    It  is  not authorized for ALACS cash sales. (T-3).  If allowed, the 15 percent supplemental allowance is  used  to  figure  the  next  month’s  MTF  BDFA.    As  an  example,  if  calculating  the  small volume  allowance  for  August,  you  would  take  the  total  meal  days  for  July,  divide  by  31 (days in month), if the total is less than 100, then the allowance is authorized. 7.16.6.  Therapeutic In-flight Meal (TIM) Allowance. A special monetary allowance equal to 80 percent of the MTF BDFA is authorized for each TIM furnished by the NM activity for aeromedical evacuation patients to be consumed in flight.  Additional guidance may be found in  AFI  41-301,  Worldwide  Aeromedical  Evacuation  System,  and  AFI  41-307,  Aeromedical Evacuation Patient Considerations and Standards of Care. 7.16.7.  Holiday and Special Meal Percentages/Allowances. An additional meal allowance is permitted for certain  federal  holidays, typically  Christmas and Thanksgiving, the Air Force birthday,  and  Airmen  appreciation  meals.    The  extra  earnings  allowed  for  holidays  and special meals are designed to recoup additional costs incurred, to include serving items in the dining facility to ESM patrons at all facilities and cash patrons at SCAMS facilities, as well as for holiday meal enhancements for inpatients (e.g., nut cups, ice cream, cake, candy, etc.). For  these  meals,  an  additional  25%  meal  allowance  is  permitted.    For  Airman  appreciation meals,  an  additional  15%  is  allowed.    Christmas  and  Thanksgiving  holiday  meals  must  be served  at  the  lunch  meal.    If  holiday  or  special  meals  are  served  on  dates  other  than  the holiday, the Accounting Spreadsheet manager should be informed.  There must be a special menu planned and served to qualify for the additional allowance.  A la Carte facilities do not   48  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 receive  an  additional  25%  on  cash  customers  as  any  additional  cost  associated  should  be calculated into the cost of the food. 7.16.7.1.  (Automated)  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet  automatically  calculates the additional  25  percent  holiday  lunch  percentage  for  Thanksgiving  and  Christmas.    To calculate  extra  earnings  for  other  holidays  and  special  meals  in  SCAMS  facilities,  the number of ESM lunch meals  served is  added to the number of cash patron lunch meals served  and  this  is  then  multiplied  by  25  percent  (or  15  percent  for  airman  appreciation meals) to equal the additional number of meal days.  This additional number of meal days multiplied by the current MTF BDFA will equal the amount of additional earnings for the holiday  lunch  meal.    For  ALACS  facilities  the  same  procedure  is  followed,  only  the additional meal day earnings for other federal holidays is determined only by the number of ESM customers, and patients served. 7.16.8.  Occupied  Bed  Day  refers  to  the  number  of  inpatients  subsisting  in  the  MTF  and equals  beds  occupied  minus  bassinets  from  the  Admission  and  Disposition  Recapitulation Report. 7.16.9.  A Meal Day is a value in which the number of meals is weighted by a predetermined percentage (IAW DOD 1338.10-M) to balance the cost and attendance variances between the meals.    The  number  of  meal  days  for  a  given  day  is  figured  by  multiplying  the  number  of breakfast,  lunch,  and  dinner  meals  served  by  the  factored  percentages  of  20,  40,  and  40 percent,  respectively,  and  totaling  the  results.    TIMs  are  valued  at  80  percent,  APV/SDS meals at 40 percent, holiday meals at 65 percent, and, if served, midnight meal at 20 percent.  If APV patrons utilize the dining facility for breakfast,  they are valued at  20 percent  of the BDFA.  Beginning in Fiscal Year 2016, the number of meal days for a given day is figured by  multiplying  the  number  of  breakfast,  lunch,  and  dinner  meals  served  by  the  factored percentages of 25, 40, and 35 percent, respectively, and totaling the results. 7.16.10.  Patient  Meal  Days  are  obtained  by  multiplying  the  occupied  bed  days  times  the appropriate meal factors. 7.16.11.  ESM Meal Days are obtained by multiplying the number of ESM patrons multiplied by the appropriate meal factors. 7.16.12.  Cash Patron Meal Days are obtained by multiplying the number of cash customers times the appropriate meal factors. 7.17.  Subsistence Account Reporting and Management. 7.17.1.  AF  Forms  544,  Rations  Earning  Record,  the  NM  Accounting  Spreadsheet  and Computrition  are  used  to  assist  NM  managers  and  the  MSA  Officer  in  overseeing  the subsistence  account,  inventory  value,  earnings  and  collections.    AF  Form  544  or  electronic equivalent, and the NM Accounting Spreadsheet will be made available to the MSA Officer to  facilitate  daily,  monthly,  quarterly,  and  end  of  fiscal  year  oversight  of  subsistence accounting.  (T-3).    NM  operations  are  encouraged  to  place  electronic  versions  of  the  544, and the NM Accounting Spreadsheet on a shared drive, with limited access to key personnel within NM and MSA. 7.17.1.1.  (Automated)  . AF Form 544 and the NM Accounting Spreadsheet have all of the information needed to monitor key financial indicators in NM. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   49  7.17.1.1.1.  The  Computrition  Inventory  Movement  Summary  Report  provides detailed information pertaining to food purchases.  The report can be sorted by food categories or dollar value.  The verified total from this report should be compared to the cost of food purchased for the day from invoices received. 7.17.1.1.2.  The  Computrition  Inventory  Cost  Report  lists  inventory  items  by category, NSN, vendor issue unit, issue cost, quantity on hand, and value of current inventory.  This value is entered on the NM Accounting Spreadsheet. 7.17.1.1.3.  AF Form 544 is used to record the number of meals served in MTFs.  The information on AF Form 544 is used as a guide for determining the number of meals to  prepare,  deciding  on  quantities  of  food  to  purchase,  store  and  issue,  helping  to control  food  costs,  and  providing  cumulative  daily,  monthly,  quarterly,  and  yearly cost  data.    The  form  covers  categories  of  inpatients  and  categories  of  diners  in  the dining facility, and TIMs.  A separate form is used daily and then taken to the MSA office.    Note:  At  minimum  a  copy  of  the  AF  Form  544  or  electronic  equivalent showing  the  categories  of  diners,  ration  earnings  by  meal,  and  daily  food  cost  data will be submitted to MSA daily, or by the first duty day following a weekend. (T-3).  The form will be signed by the NCOIC, Nutritional Medicine, or equivalent, and the MSA officer.  Both MSA and NM file a copy. (T-3). 7.17.1.2.  (Manual)  . The following three manual cost data records and financial reports may  be  used  in  NM  and  the  MSA  office  to  determine  financial  status.    Follow  specific instructions  on  forms  for  completion.    Manual  accounting  will  only  be  accomplished when computer access and the NM Accounting Spreadsheet are unavailable. (T-3).  This would not include short term system failures, as the NM Accounting Spreadsheet can be updated when systems come back online. 7.17.1.2.1.  AF  Form  544  is  completed  by  following  the  instructions  on  the  back  of the form. 7.17.1.2.2.  When documenting manually, AF Form 541 is used to provide quarterly and  cumulative  fiscal  year  summary  data  on  food  purchased  in  NM.    It  shows  the financial status operating under the SCAMS management system.  The AF Form 541 is only used in facilities performing manual accounting.  If required, the AF Form 541 is completed quarterly by the MSA Officer using data provided by NM on AF Forms 544, and 546. 7.17.1.2.3.  AF  Form  546  provides  an  overview  of  daily  financial  transactions  and current  monthly  cumulative  totals.    AF  Form  546  will  be  provided  to  the  MSA Officer each month, on a date mutually agreed upon. (T-3). 7.17.1.3.  Inpatient  Diet  Census.  Workload  figures  for  the  number  of  trays  served  to patients on the nursing units and the number and types of therapeutic diets served will be documented  on  AF  Form  2573,  Diet  Census,  or  electronic  substitute,  once  daily,  using breakfast,  lunch, or dinner data (typically lunch is used).  (T-3).  Additional  instructions are printed on the reverse side of the form.  NM gives the workload figures and weighted diet  census  from  AF  Form  2573  to  the  MSA  Office  per  local  guidance.    The  AF  Form 2573 provides critical manpower data and should be reviewed monthly by NM leadership to ensure accuracy.   50  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 7.17.1.4.  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Agency  (AFMOA)  Reporting.  On  a  monthly basis,  MTFs  with  food  service  operations  will  submit  a  spreadsheet  including  the information/data in Attachment 4 to their MTF MSA Office and Functional Manager. (T-3).  The MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) will submit a consolidated report (Excel spreadsheet),  for  their  MAJCOM,  by  MTF,  to  the  AFMOA  Uniform  Business  Office IAW AFI 41-120,  Medical Resource Management  Operations. (T-3).  The consolidated MAJCOM  report  will  be  submitted  to  AFMOA  by  the  MFM  by  no  later  than  close  of business on the 5th calendar day following the last day of the month. (T-3).  Example, the April report will be submitted by no later than 5 May. (T-3). 7.17.2.  Subsistence  Account  Management.  Primary  indicators  which  evaluate  the  financial status of the NM operation are: earnings less cost of food served, earnings minus purchases, inventory level, and periodic inventory adjustment. 7.17.2.1.  Financial  Parameters.  The  financial  status  of  the  NM  subsistence  account  is measured using food issues adjusted for spoilage and supplemental/other income, which is  referred  to  as  cost  of  food  served.  The  status  of  earnings  minus  cost  of  food  served must not exceed plus or minus 5 percent of the average monthly ration earnings at the end of each of the first  three quarters of the fiscal  year, as annotated on the AF Accounting Spreadsheet.  At the end of the fiscal  year, earnings minus cost of food served must not be more than $100.00 or plus or minus 2 percent of the average monthly credit earnings, whichever  is  greater.  (T-3).    When  calculating  the  5  percent  for  the  quarter  or  the  2 percent for the end of fiscal year, always use fiscal year to-date figures.  As an example, at the end of March take the total earnings fiscal year to-date and divide by 6 to get the monthly average, then multiply that number by 5% or 0.05 to get the plus or minus range.  Your fiscal year to-date earnings, minus cost of food served, must fall within that range. 7.17.2.2.  Fiscal Year Close-out. If, at the end of the fiscal year, the earnings minus cost of food served on the NM Accounting Spreadsheet exceeds (plus or minus) 2 percent of the average monthly earnings (total earnings, fiscal year to date, divided by 12), the MTF Commander may consider initiating a Report of Survey action. 7.17.2.3.  Transferring  a  Subsistence  Account  when  Food  Served  Exceeds  Credit Earnings. A report of survey is initiated when a NM officer or NCOIC (when no dietitian is  assigned),  accepts  a  subsistence  account  where  the  authorized  parameters  for  the current  quarter  have  not  been  met.    The  officer  who  writes  the  report  of  survey determines if there is an excessive loss, the cause of the loss, and any financial liability.  If  financial  liability  is  found,  the  commander  can  take  disciplinary  action.    If  the investigation shows an excessive loss, the MTF commander may request MAJCOM/SG authority to over purchase at the end of the subsequent fiscal quarters and at the end of the  fiscal  year,  that  portion  of  the  loss  that  exceeds  2  percent  of  the  monthly  monetary credit  earnings.    The  request  must  show  that  the  MTF  cannot  absorb  the  loss  over  a period of 3 months or by the end of the fiscal year unless it reduces food services or menu quality to the point where it would harm the morale and welfare of the subsisting patients and enlisted personnel. 7.17.2.4.  Nutritional  Medicine Service  Oversight Checklist  can be found  at  Attachment 6. AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   51  Chapter 8 PROCEDURES FOR MEDICAL FACILITIES SUPPORTED BY BASE FOOD SERVICE AND DIETETIC SHARING AGREEMENTS 8.1.

Purpose.  The  purpose  of  the  AF  Dietetic  Consultant  Program  is  to  support  the  AFMS mission through efficient  NM operations that provide quality services.   Consultant services are available  at  various  levels  of  operations.    The  Consultant  Dietitian  advises  the  AFMS,  AF/SG, AFMOA,  and  MAJCOM  SGs,  and  provides  consultant  services  to  bases  where  NM  personnel (diet  technicians)  are  assigned  without  a  credentialed  RD  and  where  no  NM  capabilities  or personnel are assigned.  The AF Career Field Manager (CFM) is the senior enlisted consultant to the  Associate  Chief  for  Dietetics,  AF  SG  Chief,  Enlisted  Medical  Force  (CMEF),  MAJCOM CMEF, and Diet Therapy MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), ensuring the development of all enlisted personnel. 9.2.

Storing Subsistence:   Are subsistence storage rooms, refrigerators, and freezers secure (locked) when not in use; (exception:  produce, and direct deliver/milk refrigerator)?  Is entry for unauthorized personnel controlled, prohibited?    Inventory Controls:  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   83   Is the storeroom manager maintaining the perpetual inventory system of subsistence stock records, source documents for subsistence purchase and issues (entries include vendor receipts and purchase invoices, GPC statements and receipts, or AF Forms 543, Food Issue Record)?  Is a physical inventory performed each month (except September) on one of the last three normal duty days and representative as of the date of the inventory (with the exception of FY close-out)?  The FY close-out in September should be conducted on the last day of the FY when possible (if not possible, then on the last duty day).   Does the MTF Commander appoint a disinterested, trained person (officer or SNCO) to perform a physical inventory of all food items?  The inventory official delivers the completed and signed inventory listing to the MSA Officer and NM Officer/NCOIC.  If there are discrepancies/differences between the physical count and inventory records (that cannot be resolved), is an Inventory Adjustment Report prepared?   At the end of each quarter and the FY, is the dollar value of the closing inventory between (not more than) 15% and 30% of the cumulative average monthly cost of food used for the FY to date?  MTFs using Prime Vendor should reduce inventory levels to 2-3 days’ supply.  Optimal inventory levels should be determined locally to ensure that adequate food is on hand/available in case of disaster or emergency situations when deliveries may be disrupted.  Issuing and Costing Subsistence:   Do storeroom personnel issue subsistence using Computrition (automated) or AF Form 543 (manual)?  Direct delivery items may be issued on the day they are received.  Perishable fresh fruits and vegetables may be issued the day of purchase and receipt.  High volume, low-cost items may be issued as needed each day, or for a longer use period.     Does the person receiving the food items from the storeroom count and verify food received and sign the form in the received block?  If more food items are issued than needed, are they returned to inventory under the returned column?   Does the MTF use the Last-In First-Out (LIFO) costing method for recording purchases and costing items?  Cashier Operations:  Is there separation of financial duties and responsibilities in authorizing, processing, recording, and receiving cash transactions?  Cashiering and accounting duties must be separated to ensure adequate internal controls to prevent loss of funds.   Does NM have:  appropriate and authorized change fund (IAW DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Vol 5);  for a la carte operations, a cash control supervisor designated   84  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016 in writing; and, an adequate funds storage safe to hold the change fund, cash sales, and guarded forms (such as AF IMT 79)?  Is AF Form 2570 used to issue the cash drawer and AF IMT 79 to the cashier?  Is the same AF Form 2570 used by the cashier to return the cash drawer, cash collected, and AF IMT 79 to the cash control officer after the meal?  Are any discrepancies noted on the AF IMT 79?   Does the cash control supervisor indicate funds and guarded forms (AF IMT 79) for turn in to MSA Office using AF Form 1305 for cash collected and AF Form 1254 for guarded forms used to document the transfer of responsibility from NM to the MSA Office?   Does the cash control supervisor indicate funds and guarded forms (AF IMT 79) for turn in to MSA Office using AF Form 1305 for case collected and AF Form 1254 for guarded forms used to document the transfer of responsibility from NM to MSA?  Is all cash collected and AF IMT 79 forms used turned in to the MSA office daily, excluding weekends?  If the storage limit on the safe/funds storage container is inadequate to support the amount of cash collected over a 2 or 3 day weekend, NM should make arrangements with the MSA Office to turn in cash during the weekend or request an increase in the amount of funds that can be stored.  In any case, cash deposit paperwork must be done on a daily basis, even if the funds must be held over the weekend.   Are cash registers correctly programmed to calculate both the charge cash patrons the DoD-directed surcharge and correctly total the surcharges from each meal period?   Is the MTF MSA Office correctly dividing the surcharge between the AF Military Personnel Appropriation and the Defense Health Program O&M appropriation?  MSA Office is supposed to proportionately divide the surcharge accordingly with the start of each FY. If the NM DFAC does not have cash registers (SCAMS operations), do all diners, except ambulatory and transient patients, sign for meals using the appropriate number of AF IMT 79s for each meal?  Does the cashier verify the diner’s identification?   Are completed AF IMT 79 forms and collected cash delivered to the MSA Office at least once each normal duty day and the MSA Office verifies the cash receipts against the total amount of cash received as annotated on AF IMT 79s? Is diner eligibility and identification correctly verified?   Eligibility and Identification of Diners:    Are diners appropriately processed based on their status?  Recipe Pricing:  AFMAN44-144  20 JANUARY 2016   85  1.  For a la carte operations, is each recipe item priced and sold on an individual item basis?  Computrition menu pricing reports such as the Computrition Recipe Price Report should be used/available; if not, each recipe cost must be manually calculated.  Menu item pricing must include DoD surcharges.  NM Ration Accounting:   Are NM accounting parameters accurate and up to date, whether calculated/using the AF Accounting Spreadsheet (Excel) or manually?      Is the MTF Basic Daily Food Allowance (BDFA) accurately calculated, on a monthly basis, using the most current monthly Food Cost Index (FCI)? Is the Patient BDFA correctly calculated (BDFA plus 15% supplemental allowance)?  Is the Patient BFDA only used to calculate patient meal day earnings? If applicable, were NM activities using SCAMS and serving less than 100 average daily meal days for both patient and DFAC patron rations applying the authorized additional supplemental allowance of 15% of the MTF BDFA (this is called the small volume feeding allowance/percentage)?  This eligibility is determined at the end of each month and is applied to ESM and SCAMS DFAC patrons only.  It is not authorized for a la carte cash sales.  If allowed, the 15% supplemental allowance is used to figure the next month’s MTF BDFA. If applicable, was the Therapeutic In-flight Meals (TIMs) allowance appropriately applied/used?  A special monetary allowance equal to 80% of the MTF BDFA is authorized for each TIM furnished by NM for aeromedical evacuation patients to consume in-flight.   Were holiday and special meal percentages/allowances of an additional 25% (for federal holidays, the AF birthday, and Easter) and 15% (for airman appreciation meals) appropriately applied to ESM DFAC patrons at all facilities and cash patrons at SCAMS facilities (a la carte facilities do not receive an additional 25% for cash customers of patients during these meals)?  To claim the additional percentage, holiday meals must be served on the actual day designated as the holiday.  Christmas and Thanksgiving holiday meals must be served at the lunch meal.  There must be a special menu planned and served to qualify for the allowance.   Are occupied bed days accurately calculated?  Occupied bed day refers to the number of inpatients subsisting in the MTF and equals beds occupied minus bassinets from the Admission and Disposition Recapitulation Report.   Are meal days accurately calculated?
