General.  This  AFI  provides  guidelines  and  restrictions  for  AC-130W  operations  and applies  to  AC-130W  aircrews  at  all  management  levels  concerned  with  operation  of  the AC130W.    It  is  a  compilation  of  information  from  aircraft  flight  manuals,  Flight  Information Publications (FLIP) and other Air Force directives, and is an original source document for many areas.  This instruction supersedes all guidance in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP).   It  is  written for normal  and contingency operations to  reduce  procedural  changes at the  onset  of  contingencies.    Training  procedures  are  included.    When  guidance  in  this  AFI conflicts  with  another  basic/source  document,  that  document  takes  precedence.    For  matters where  this  AFI    is  the  source  document,  waiver  authority  is  in  accordance  with  (IAW) Paragraph  1.4.    For  matters  where  this  AFI  repeats  information  in  another  document,  follow waiver  authority  outlined  in  the  basic/source  document.    HQ  AFSOC/A3V  has  overall responsibility for the administration of this AFI.  (T-2) 1.2.  Applicability.  This AFI is applicable to all crew members operating the AC130W. 1.3.  Key Definitions: 1.3.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.3.2.  “Should” indicates a preferred, but not mandatory, method of accomplishment. 1.3.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.3.4.  “WARNING”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  may  result  in personal injury or loss of life if not carefully followed. 1.3.5.  “CAUTION”  indicates  operating  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  which  may  result  in damage to equipment if not carefully followed. 1.3.6.  “Note” indicates operating procedures, techniques, etc., which are considered essential to emphasize. 1.3.7.  See Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for additional terms. 1.4.  Deviations and Waivers.  Do not deviate from the policies and guidance in this AFI except when the situation demands immediate action to ensure safety.  (T-2) 1.4.1.  Although  this  publication  provides  guidance  for  aircraft  operations  under  most circumstances, it is not a substitute for sound judgment.  When it is necessary to protect the crew and aircraft from a situation not covered by this instruction and when immediate action is  required,  the  Pilot  in  Command  (PIC)  has  ultimate  authority  and  responsibility  for  the course  of  action  to  be  taken.    Report  deviations,  without  waiver,  through  channels  to  HQ AFSOC/A3 within 48 hours, followed by a written report.  (T-2) 1.4.2.  Unless  otherwise  indicated,  HQ  AFSOC/A3  is  the  waiver  authority  for  operational procedure  requirements  contained  in  this  volume.    HQ  AFSOC/A3  may  delegate  this authority to  Commander  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces  (COMAFSOF)  for operationally  assigned  Special  Operations  Forces  (SOF)  during  contingency  operations.    If   12  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 the  AFSOC/A3  chooses  to  delegate  waiver  authority,  it  will  be  done  in  writing  and  will specify which portions of this instruction may be waived by the COMAFSOF.  When waiver authority is delegated, HQ AFSOC/A3V will receive a copy of all approved waivers.  (T-2) 1.4.2.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk IAW AFI 33-360: 1.4.2.1.1.  “Tier 0”  (T-0)  Requirement is external to the Air Force and consequence of  non-compliance  is  determined  by  respective  non-AF  authority.    Requests  for waivers  must  be  processed  through  command  channels  to  publication  OPR  for consideration 1.4.2.1.2.  “Tier 1”  (T-1)  Non-compliance puts Airmen, commanders, or the USAF strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or unacceptable,  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waiver  authority  is  the  MAJCOM/CC (Delegable  no  lower  than  the  MAJCOM  Director)  with  concurrence  of  the publication’s Approving Official. 1.4.2.1.3.  “Tier  2”    (T-2)    Non-compliance  may  degrade  mission  or  program effectiveness  or  efficiency  and  has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable, fraud, waste or abuse.  Waiver  authority  is  the  MAJCOM/CC  (Delegable  no  lower  than  the  MAJCOM Director). 1.4.2.1.4.  “Tier  3”    (T-3)    Non-compliance  may  limit  mission  or  program effectiveness  or  efficiency  and  has  a  relatively  remote  potential  to  create  risk  of mission or program failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable, fraud, waste or abuse.  Waiver  authority is the Wing/CC (Delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent). 1.4.3.  Crews requiring waivers or technical assistance should contact the controlling agency for  proper  coordination.    The  PIC  must  consider  all  factors  (Crew  Duty  Time/Flight  Duty Period  (FDP)),  aircrew  qualification  levels,  type  mission  and  sortie  duration,  weather, Notices to Airmen, and alternates) before requesting the waiver.  It is highly recommended that the PIC contact squadron Top 3 (Squadron Commander (CC), Director of Operations & Assistant  Director  of  Operations)  or  Operations  Group  Standardization/Evaluation (OG/OGV) for any advice or assistance prior to waiver request (time permitting).  Transmit mission  data  to  the  controlling  command  and  control  (C2)  agency  by  any  means  available (i.e., Defense Switching Network (DSN), High Frequency (HF) radio, Iridium phone and L-Band Satellite Communication (SATCOM), etc.). 1.5.

See Attachment 1 for common terms used herein. 1.10.  Aircrew Operational Reports.  The information requirement contained in this Instruction is  exempt  from  licensing  in  accordance  with  Chapter  C4.,  paragraph  C4.4.,  of  DoD  8910.1-M, Department  of  Defense  Procedures  for  Management  of  Information  Requirements  (reference (C4.4.2.)).   14  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Chapter 2 COMMAND AND CONTROL 2.1.  General.  The AFSOC C2 system is based on the principles of centralized monitoring and decentralized  control  and  execution.    The  result  is  a  C2  mechanism  which  keeps  the  AFSOC Commander informed of the current status of AFSOC forces while enabling the Wing or Group Commander to exercise control over day-to-day operations. 2.2.  Operational  Control  (OPCON).  AFSOC  is  designated  as  the  controlling  agency  for United  States  Special  Operations  Command  (USSOCOM)  assigned  Air  Force  SOF  aircraft, while Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOC) have OPCON of theater-based assets.  In practice,  the  Special  Operations  Wing  or  Group  Commander  routinely  exercises  delegated responsibility  for  planning  and  executing  home-station  AFSOC  missions,  off-station  training missions,  and  missions  transiting  to/from  other  Areas  of  Responsibility  (AORs).    The  Wing  or Group  Commander,  in  turn,  exercises  control  of  home-station  missions  through  the  command post (CP) supporting the wing or group.  In the event that assigned forces undergo a Change in Operational  Control  (CHOP),  responsibility  for  mission  monitoring  passes  from  the  wing  or group C2 facility to the gaining command.  Changeover will be accomplished IAW the pertinent Operational Plan, Operational Order, or deployment or execution order.  (T-2) 2.2.1.  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  OPLAN/CONPLAN,  Wing  or  Group  OPCON terminates  when  forces  first  land  in  the  gaining  TSOC/Joint  Special  Operations  Air Component  (JSOAC)  AOR;  Wings/Groups  resume  OPCON  of  redeploying  forces  when those forces first land outside the TSOC/JSOAC AOR.  (T-2) 2.3.  Waiver and Approval Authorities. 2.3.1.  The AFSOC/A3 holds waiver/approval authority for items normally authorized above wing level, and for those items identified as COMAFSOF authorities.  (T-2) 2.3.2.  Waiver request will be the responsibility of the C2 agency with the operational control of the mission.  Operational waivers will be coordinated through the Stan/Eval channels.  (T-2) 2.4.  Mission  Monitoring.  The  AFSOC  Operations  Center  monitors  all  off-station  AFSOC aircraft  via  Theater  Battle  Management  Core  Systems  (TBMCS)  –  Execution  Status  and Monitoring (ESTAT), the Global Decision Support System (GDSS), Theater Situation Reports, and aircrew Deployed Status Reports (DSR).  Aircraft equipped with Blue Force Tracker (BFT) devices  are  tracked  near  real  time  via  the  Common  Operating  Picture  (COP).    Inputs  to  these various tracking tools are provided by the C2 agency with OPCON. 2.4.1.  PIC or mission commander flight reporting duties: 2.4.1.1.  Stations With Mobility Air Force  (MAF) C2 Agency.   Aircrews will provide a “Thirty  Minute”  Out  Call.    Transmit  an  Ultra  High  Frequency  (UHF)  or  Very  High Frequency  (VHF)  arrival  advisory  to  the  destination  C2  agency  approximately  30 minutes  prior  to  arrival.    Provide  Estimated  Time  in  Blocks  (ETB).    Local  MAF  C2 agents will enter mission data (arrival, departure, and advisory messages) in GDSS when applicable.  Additionally, aircrews must keep their controlling C2 agency appraised of all AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   15  actual  takeoff  and  landing  times,  projected  takeoff  times,  and  other  related  information within 30 minutes after landing.  (T-2) 2.4.1.2.  Stations  Without  MAF  C2  Agency.    Transmit  mission  data  (arrival,  departure, and advisory messages) to the controlling C2 agency, within 30 minutes after landing, by any  means  available.    (Preference  in  the  following  order:    DSN/commercial  telephone, HF  phone  patch,  Iridium  Phone).    For  critical  C2  communications,  i.e.  aircraft  waiver request, maintenance delay, etc., voice communications are the primary method.  (T-2) 2.4.1.3.  Provide controlling C2 agency with daily DSR. 2.4.1.4.  Reporting Agencies.  See Table 2.1. Table 2.1.  Reporting Agencies.

Search  and  Rescue  Satellite-Aided  Tracking  (SARSAT).  SARSAT  is  an  international satellite system for Search and Rescue (SAR).  It consists of a constellation of seven satellites in low earth orbit, 5 geostationary satellites and a network of earth stations, which provide distress alert and location information to appropriate rescue authorities anywhere in the world for users in distress.  The SARSAT detect beacons broadcasting on 406.025 Megahertz (MHz).  The current SARSAT system consists of 64 Local User Terminals (LUT) and 26 Mission Control Centers in 32 countries, including 12 in the United States.  SARSAT coverage on 406 MHz is worldwide.  The  Rescue  Coordination  Center  (RCC)  at  Langley  AFB,  VA,  maintains  one  deployable  LUT (camper sized, air transportable van) to provide contingency coverage. 2.6.  Designation of a COMAFSOF.  The Commander, USSOCOM, or TSOC may designate a COMAFSOF.    This  should  be  done  in  writing,  and  the  designation  letter  will  include  the individual  by  name,  and  the  geographic  area  of  authority.    In  the  absence  of  a  USSOCOM  or TSOC designated COMAFSOF, AFSOC/A3 may designate an individual with waiver authority equivalent to a designated COMAFSOF.  This must be done in writing, and the designation letter should  include  the  individual  by  name,  and  the  geographic  area  of  authority.    The  designation letter should be updated to reflect any personnel changes as a result of prolonged deployments. 2.7.  Mission  Commander.  A  mission  commander  will  be  designated  when  more  than  one aircraft or crew is deployed away from home station for training, exercises, or other operations.  The mission commander will be rated,  and should be  a field  grade officer.  The mission or  air AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   17  mission  commander  will  not  be  a  primary  crew  member  for  exercises,  but  may  fly  as  a  crew member  on  non-exercise  related  missions.    Mission  commanders  are  responsible  for  overall mission execution as well as aircraft and personnel supporting the mission.  Mission commander duties include, but are not limited to:  (T-2) 2.7.1.  Briefing crews on local operating procedures. 2.7.2.  Coordinating with Air Traffic Control (ATC), Combat Control Team (CCT), Special Tactics Squadron (STS), Range Control Officer (RCO), users, and others  that may have an impact on the mission. 2.7.3.  Ensuring personnel have ample and adequate billeting, sustenance, and transportation arrangements. 2.7.4.  Ensuring maintenance personnel know of aircraft and fuel requirements. 2.7.5.  Submitting timely reports on aircraft movements. 2.8.  Pilot  in  Command  Responsibility  and  Authority.  AF  Form  4327A,  Crew  Flight Authorization (FA), designates a PIC for all flights.  PICs are: 2.8.1.  In command of all persons on board the aircraft. 2.8.2.  Responsible  for  the  welfare  of  their  aircrew  members,  Mission  Essential  Personnel (MEP), and the safe accomplishment of the mission. 2.8.3.  Vested  with  the  authority  necessary  to  manage  their  crew  and  safely  accomplish  the mission. 2.8.4.  The  final  mission  authority  and  will  make  decisions  not  specifically  assigned  to  a higher authority. 2.8.5.  The final authority for accepting a waiver affecting the crew or mission. 2.8.6.  Charged  with  keeping  the  applicable  commander  informed  of  mission  progress  and difficulties. 2.8.7.  Responsible for the timely reporting of aircraft movements in the absence of a mission commander. 2.8.7.1.  Maintenance Delays Away from Home Station.  PICs will coordinate with local maintenance  for  available  support,  and  then  report  to  AFSOC  Combat  Logistics Operations  (CLO):    DSN  579-8925,  (850)  884-8925  or  1-800-451-7705.    When reporting, describe the problem, the assistance available (if any) and assistance required.  Any time the aircraft experiences over a 2-hour maintenance delay the PIC will report to AFSOC Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) as soon as practical (regardless of the support being received from the deployed location).  (T-2) 2.9.  Airborne  Mission  Commander  (AMC).  The  individual  responsible  for  the  overall employment  of  all  air  assets  assigned  to  the  mission.    Required  for  multi-element,  multi-event formations,  and/or  where  mission  complexity  dictates.    The  AMC  will  not  be  a  primary  crew member and should be on headset.  (T-2) 2.10.  Deputy  Mission  Commander  (DMC).  Required on all missions employing a dedicated AMC,  on  all  multi-element  formation  missions,  and  on  all  single-element  formations  of  three   18  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 aircraft or more.  The DMC assumes command if conditions prevent the AMC from controlling the  mission.    The  DMC  may  be  a  primary  crew  member,  and  is  usually  the  Formation Commander on AMC controlled missions.  The DMC should not be on the same aircraft as the AMC.  (T-2) 2.11.  Mission  Clearance  Decision.  The final  decision to  delay a mission may be made either by the agency with OPCON or the PIC when, in the opinion of either, conditions are not safe to start or continue a mission.  Final responsibility for the safe conduct of the mission rests with the PIC.  If the PIC refuses a mission, it will not depart until the conditions have been corrected or improved so that the mission can operate safely.  Another PIC and aircrew will not be alerted to take the same mission under the same conditions.  (T-2) 2.11.1.  Diverting  or  rerouting  a  mission  must  be  authorized  by  the  commander  with OPCON,  except  in  an  emergency  or  when  required  by  en  route  or  terminal  weather conditions or facilities.  In the event of an emergency or weather related divert or reroute, the mission commander PIC must notify the controlling authority as soon as possible.  (T-2) 2.11.1.1.  The  controlling  agency  directing  the  diversion  or  rerouting  is  responsible  for ensuring destination requirements or facilities are adequate for the aircraft and aircrew. 2.11.1.2.  The PIC will notify the controlling agency of any aircraft or aircrew limitations that may preclude diverting or rerouting the mission.  (T-2) 2.11.2.  When directing an aircraft to an alternate airfield, the controlling agency will ensure the PIC is provided existing and forecasted weather for the alternate.  If the planned alternate is unsuitable upon arrival at destination, the controlling agency will advise the PIC of other suitable alternates.  (T-2) 2.12.  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Support.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  Department  of  Defense  to cooperate  with  civilian  law  enforcement  officials  to  the  maximum  extent  practicable.  AFI 10801,  Defense  Support  of  Civilian  Authorities  (DSCA),  incorporates  the  appropriate directive  and  provides  uniform  policies  and  procedures  service  members  must  follow  when supporting  federal,  state,  and  local  civilian  law  enforcement  agencies.    It  establishes  specific limitations and restrictions on the use of Air Force personnel, equipment, facilities, and services by civilian law enforcement organizations.  Report all requests for assistance and coordinate all requests from civilian law enforcement authorities through the appropriate C2 channels.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   19  Chapter 3 CREW COMPLEMENT AND MANAGEMENT 3.1.  Aircrew Qualification.  Each person assigned as a primary crew member must be qualified or in training for qualification in that crew position, mission, and Mission Design Series (MDS) aircraft.  (T-2) 3.1.1.  Basic  Aircraft Qualified (BAQ) crew members may perform  primary  crew duties on any  non-mission  sortie  and  on  missions  (including  unilateral  training,  joint  training  and exercises) when receiving mission qualification training or evaluations under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their respective crew position. 3.1.2.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)  crew  members  may  perform  primary  crew  duties  on any unilateral training mission.  For other missions, the unit commander must determine the readiness of each basic mission capable crew member to perform primary crew duties. 3.1.3.  Noncurrent  (NC)  or  Unqualified  (UNQ)  pilots  may  perform  crew  duties  only  on designated training or evaluation missions under the supervision of a qualified instructor or flight  examiner  pilot.    Both  pilots  must  be  fully  qualified  unless  exempted  by  AFI  11-401, Aviation Management.  (T-2) 3.1.4.  Other NC or UNQ crew members may perform duties in their primary crew position on any mission when under direct supervision of a qualified instructor or flight examiner in their  respective  crew  position.    In  this  case,  the  student  crew  member  and  the  instructor  or flight examiner fulfills the requirement for one primary position as specified in Table 3.1. 3.1.5.  For  the  purpose  of  aircraft/mission  familiarization,  the  Group  Commander,  or COMAFSOF  may  authorize  unqualified  personnel  to  perform  duties  in  non-pilot  crew positions  during  flight  under  direct  instructor/flight  examiner  supervision.    (T-3)    The purpose of this familiarization training is to enhance crew esprit and to enable the individual to gain a better understanding of the crew concept.  This training will only be conducted in permissive environments, and only when mission accomplishment is not impacted.  Comply with AFI 11401.  (T-2) 3.1.6.  Unqualified  personnel  attending  the  SOF  Weapons  Instructor  Course  (WIC),  may perform  duties  during  non-critical  phases  of  flight  in  all  crew  positions  on  WIC  syllabus-approved  training  sorties  when  under  the  direct  supervision  of  an  MDS-qualified  WIC instructor in that crew position. 3.2.  Crew Complement.  Minimum crew complement will be as specified in the flight manual and Table 3.1.  The group commander or COMAFSOF is the waiver authority for all other crew positions above the minimum specified by the flight manual.  (T-3) Table 3.1.  Crew Qualification Complement  (T-3).

Note 2:  Both ACs must be qualified in all phases of the mission to be accomplished.  Transfer of PIC duties between qualified ACs will be briefed to the crew. Note 3:  Comply with the following requirements: - During training, all BAQ events, Night Vision Goggle (NVG) takeoffs and landings, tactical recoveries, and hot refueling may be conducted without a NAV or CSO on board the aircraft. - PICs may elect to have the NAV remain at the Mission Operator Pallet (MOP) for Air-to-Air Refueling (AAR) when mission dictates. - A CSO is not required to accomplish AAR. - A NAV or CSO that is NC or is undergoing training for weapons systems added after their initial qualification may be supervised by an instructor occupying the other MOP position.  An UNQ NAV or CSO requires a standing instructor.  If both the NAV and CSO are UNQ, two standing instructors are required.   EXCEPTION:  If the instructor assesses that the training for a specific sortie can be accomplished with one instructor and two students (MOP instruction only), the squadron director of operations may waive the requirement for 2 standing instructors. Note 4:  Unit/mission commanders may authorize local mission training flights without a CSO on board when manning or systems limitations dictate.  In this case, live fire operations are not authorized. Note 5:  One AG is required on augmented basic crews if other crew members can periodically scan the cargo compartment. Note 6:  Comply with the following requirements during mission sorties: - Only one AG is required during mission training sorties that will not conduct Common Launch Tube (CLT) installation/removal procedures or live fire any Gun Weapon Systems (GWS).  One AG is authorized to configure GWS for motion, but will not place rounds in the GWS. - Hot refueling may be conducted with one AG performing panel operator duties. - Two AGs are required to conduct CLT installation/removal procedures. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   21  - Two (three for augmented mission) AGs are required to perform live fire operations when only one GWS will be utilized. - Three (four for augmented missions) AGs are required to perform live fire operations when utilizing multiple GWS. - Instructors may act as a primary crew member while instructing a single NC AG.  Instructors will not act as a primary crew member while actively instructing UNQ AGs.  Instructors will not instruct more than two UNQ/NC AGs at one time.

A fully mission capable aircraft is the ultimate objective of the logistics effort.  The  final  responsibility  regarding  equipment  required  for  a  mission  rests  with  the  PIC.    If  one crew accepts an aircraft to operate a mission or mission segment without an item or system, this acceptance does not commit that crew, or a different crew, to accept subsequent operations with the  same  item  or  system  inoperative.    When  the  PIC  considers  an  item  essential,  designate  the component  mission  essential  (ME)  on  the  Air  Force  Technical  Order  (AFTO)  Form  781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document, and the item will be repaired or replaced prior to departure.  (T-2) 4.2.  Policy.  This chapter provides guidance on how to operate with degraded equipment.  If the PIC  elects  to  operate  with  degraded  equipment  or  aircraft  systems,  coordinate  mission requirements  (i.e.,  revised  departure  times,  fuel  requirements,  maintenance  requirements,  etc.) prior to flight with the mission control agency to ensure the decision does not adversely impact follow-on missions.  (T-2) 4.3.  Aircraft Operating Guidelines: 4.3.1.  Pressurization  and  Air-conditioning  Systems:   Pressurization  and  both  air-conditioning systems should be operational.  If a system fails at an en route stop, the mission may continue to a destination with repair capability.  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-2) 4.3.2.  Electrical System:  All engine Alternating Current (AC) generators will be operational prior  to  departure.    If  a  generator  fails  at  an  en  route  stop,  the  mission  may  continue  to  a destination with repair capability.  Required en route stops are authorized.  If the aircraft is equipped  with  a  failed  bearing  indicating  system,  the  generator  may  be  turned  off  and monitored in lieu of disconnecting the generator.  (T-2) 4.3.3.  An operative Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) generator is required for unrestricted flight.  If  the  system  is  inoperative,  flight  in  daylight  Visual  Meteorological  Conditions  (VMC) within 100 nm  of  a  suitable  airfield  is  permissible  provided  no  other  electrical  malfunction exists.    An  inoperative  APU  generator  will  be  removed  and  padded  prior  to  operating  the APU.  (T-2) 4.3.4.  Fuel  System:    The  primary  concern  with  inoperative  fuel  boost  pumps  or  quantity indicators  is  fuel  balance  and  wing  loading.    Degraded  operation  is  permissible;  however, flight  crews  must  consider  potentially  trapped  fuel  and  decreased  range  should  further degradation  occur.    The  following  paragraphs  provide  guidelines  for  degraded  fuel  system operations under most circumstances. 4.3.4.1.  One pump must be operable for each external tank containing fuel.  (T-2) 4.3.4.2.  One main tank fuel indicator may be inoperative.  Two main tank indicators may be inoperative provided they are not symmetrical tanks or on the same wing.  (T-2) 4.3.4.2.1.  The  tank  with  the  inoperative  indicator  and  its  symmetrical  tank  quantity will be verified by use of a fuel tank dip stick.  (T-2)   24  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 4.3.4.2.2.  At en route stops when engines are shut down, dip check the tank with the inoperative indicator and the symmetrically opposite tank.  (T-2) 4.3.4.2.3.  Begin  cross-feed  operation  when  the  symmetrically  opposite  quantity indicator  has  decreased  to  1,500  pounds  (inboards)  and  2,500  pounds  (outboards).  (T-2) 4.3.4.2.4.  Engine  out  training  using  the  engine  corresponding  to  the  inoperative indicator or it’s symmetrically opposite will not  be conducted during tank to  engine operation.  (T-2) 4.3.4.2.5.  Maintain symmetrical engine fuel flow.  (T-2) 4.3.4.2.6.  Plan to terminate flights with a minimum of 8,000 pounds calculated main tank fuel.  (T-2) 4.3.4.3.  One external fuel tank indicator may be inoperative provided both external fuel tanks  are  checked  full  or  empty.    Both  external  fuel  tank  indicators  may  be  inoperative provided  both  external  tanks  are  checked  empty.    When  an  external  tank  indicator  is inoperative  and  the  tank  cannot  be  visually  checked  empty  due  to  foam  modification, comply with the following prior to flight:  (T-2) 4.3.4.3.1.  Check  pressure  with  each  pump  in  the  external  tank.    If  no  pressure  is obtained, the tank is verified empty.  (T-2) 4.3.4.3.2.  If  pressure  is  obtained,  ground-transfer  the  fuel  from  the  external  tank.  Defuel the external tank if unable to ground transfer.  (T-2) 4.3.4.3.3.  When unable to verify an external tank is empty prior to engine start, place the tank on cross-feed until no pressure is obtained.  This will be completed prior to takeoff.  (T-2) 4.3.4.4.  Both  auxiliary  tank  indicators  may  be  inoperative  provided  auxiliary  fuel quantity is verified by the tank sight gauge.  (T-2) 4.3.4.5.  Both  a  main  and  external  fuel  tank  indicator  may  be  inoperative  on  the  same wing provided steps in Paragraphs 4.3.4.2 and 4.3.4.3 are followed.  (T-2) 4.3.4.6.  For  other  than  normal  ground  refueling/defueling  operations  and  associated guidelines in this chapter, fuel will not be transferred into or out of a main or external fuel tank with an inoperative indicator or its symmetrical tank except the following:  (T-2) 4.3.4.6.1.  Fuel transfer into a main or external tank with an inoperative indicator may be accomplished during contingency or emergency fuel need situations.  All transfers, under these conditions, will be coordinated verbally and visually with the P/CP as a backup  for  lateral  wing  balance.    Compliance  with  Paragraphs  4.3.4.2,  4.3.4.3  and sub-paragraphs still apply.  (T-2) 4.3.4.6.2.  A  reliable  source  of  known  quantity  transferred  must  be  available.    This source  can  be  either  the  internal  aircraft  operating  fuel  quantity  indicators,  the Tanker’s Air Refueling System, or the fuel truck.  (T-2) 4.3.4.6.3.  Maintain symmetrical tanks within 1,000 pounds at all times.  Initiate fuel transfer  by  opening  only  the  refuel  valve  corresponding  to  the  inoperative  fuel AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   25  quantity  indicator.    Verify  fuel  is  being  transferred  into  the  tank,  and  then  open  the remaining  refuel  valves.    When  the  symmetrical  tank  reaches  the  desired  fuel  level, close  both  refuel  valves  while  verifying  a  pressure  increase  on  the  fuel  pressure transmitter.  Close the other refuel valves as appropriate.  (T-2)          Note:  To avoid an  inadvertent  pressure  disconnect,  coordinate  with  the  tanker  to  use  only  one  fuel transfer pump until all receiver refuel valves are open.       Note:  If the refuel valve corresponding  to  the  inoperative  fuel  quantity  indicator  loses  power  during  fuel transfer, the only indication will be an increase in the manifold fuel pressure.  If this occurs, fuel  transfer  will be terminated until  the  failed refuel  valve is  identified and the other power source is selected.  (T-2) 4.3.5.  Anti-skid  System:    The  anti-skid  may  be  inoperative  for  flight  to  a  destination  with repair capability.  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-2) 4.3.5.1.  A local training flight may continue once airborne if the anti-skid fails provided the system is turned off.  The mission is restricted to one termination landing.  (T-2) 4.3.6.  Landing Gear System:  If a landing gear or position indicating system malfunction is encountered, only a full stop landing will be made.  Gear will not be moved from the down and  locked  position.    The  discrepancy  will  be  corrected  prior  to  the  next  flight.    (T-2)         Exception:    If  repair  capability  does  not  exist  and  a  positive  determination  is  made  that further flight can be accomplished with the gear down and locked, the aircraft may be flown to a destination where repair capability exists provided the gear is not moved from the down and locked position.  Required en route stops are authorized.  (T-2) 4.3.7.  Doors  and  Ramp  System:    Aircraft  will  not  depart  on  a  pressurized  flight  unless  the door warning light system for the cargo ramp is operative.  (T-2) 4.3.7.1.  Aircraft  will  not  be  flown  with  a  crew  entrance  door  or  crew  entrance  door warning light malfunction.  (T-2) 4.3.7.2.  Aircraft  will  not  be  flown  pressurized  with  a  cargo  ramp  lock  malfunction.  Unpressurized flight is authorized with a cargo ramp lock malfunction only when mission requirements dictate.  (T-2) 4.3.8.  Navigations Systems:  Comply with FLIP series publications for required navigational systems while operating in the Minimum Navigation Performance System (MNPS).  (T-2) 4.3.8.1.  For  flights  in  MNPS  airspace  and  below  in  the  North  Atlantic  Region  or  the Composite Hawaii/Mainland Route System, the following minimum operable navigation systems are mandatory:  (T-2)       Note:  ATC uses the same reporting and investigating criteria for gross navigational errors that occur below as well as within MNPS airspace. 4.3.8.1.1.  Two  independent  sources  of  drift  and  ground  speed  (GS),  i.e.,  doppler velocity  system  (DVS)  and  inertial  navigation  system  (INS),  DVS  and  global positioning system (GPS), or INS and GPS.  (T-2) 4.3.8.1.2.  Two independent sources of heading, i.e., one C-12 compass system and an INS or two C-12 compass systems.  The C-130 standby compass is not considered a separate source for the purposes of this paragraph.  (T-2)     Note:  For flights above 72 degrees North an operable INS and GPS are required.  (T-2)   26  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 4.3.8.2.  For  flights  on  all  other  Category  I  routes,  the  following  minimum  operable navigation systems are mandatory:  (T-2) 4.3.8.2.1.

Aircraft  will  not  depart  with  an  inoperative  IFF/SIF without the approval of ATC and the PIC.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   27  Chapter 5 AIRLAND OPERATIONS 5.1.  Aircraft  Maximum  Gross  Weight  Policy.  Aircraft  maximum  gross  weight  is  155,000 pounds.  Waiver authority for operations up to 165,000 pounds is Operations Group Commander or COMAFSOF/Commander Air Force Forces for AFSOC C-130 operations within their AOR.  (T-3)  Waiver authority for operations above 165,000 pounds, not to exceed 175,000 pounds, is HQ AFSOC/A3.  Operations above 155,000 pounds require an AFTO Form 781A entry with the actual  gross  weight  at  which  the  aircraft  was  operated.    Operations  above  155,000  pounds, although structurally possible, are not advisable for routine operations and should be limited due to  the  increased  airframe  fatigue  and  maintenance  costs  incurred.    When  operating  aircraft  at gross  weights  in  excess  of  155,000  pounds  use  primary  fuel  management  and  check  the  limit flight speed versus altitude chart in Section 5 of the flight manual.  Aircraft will not be operated in  such  a  manner  to  exceed  flight  manual  or  performance  manual  limitations  during  ground  or flight  operations.    Preflight  Operational  Risk  Management  (ORM)  will  focus  on  takeoff conditions/obstacles  and  extreme  diligence  will  be  used  when  computing  takeoff  and  landing data (TOLD).  Climb out factor and 3-engine climb performance will be incorporated into TOLD cross-check.    Tactical  operations  above  155,000  pounds  for  non-contingency  missions  are  not authorized.  Aircraft will land at or below 155,000 pounds.  (T-2) 5.2.  Checklists.  Accomplish  all  checklists  with  strict  discipline.    A  checklist  is  not  complete until  all  items  are  accomplished.    (T-2)              Exception:    The  After  Takeoff  Checklist  may  be called  complete  with  the  exception  of  the  leading  edge  check.

The PIC  may  turn  off  anti-collision  lights  when  it  is  in  the  best  interest  of  safety  to  do  so.    30  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Aircraft  with  both  anti-collision  lights  and  strobe  lights  inoperative  may  continue  to  a  base where repairs can be made.  (T-2) 5.10.3.  Formation  and  leading  edge  lights  should  be  on  in  addition  to  the  anti-collision/strobe and position lights during operations below 10,000 ft.  Landing lights will be used in accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol 3 Chapter 5.  (T-2)    Note:  Formations may vary lighting as necessary provided adequate visual identification of the formation is maintained. 5.10.4.  NVG operations may dictate that external lights are turned off or Infrared (IR) lenses used.  Conduct training operations with reduced or no external lighting within the confines of designated Restricted or Warning areas or host nation approved areas IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.    Single  ship  aircraft  will  display  normal  aircraft  lighting  outside  Special  Use  Airspace (SUA).    In  standard  formation,  all  aircraft  except  the  last  in  the  formation  will  display formation lights with brightness set and IR anti-collision lights as required.  The last aircraft in the formation will display lights in accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 5.10.5.  Contingency operations may dictate that external lights are off and internal lights are limited to the minimum necessary for aircrew activities. 5.11.  Advisory/Required Calls. 5.11.1.  The  PF  will  announce  intentions  during  departures,  arrivals,  approaches,  and  when circumstances  require  deviating  from  normal  procedures.

The pilot may continue to 100 Height Above Touchdown (HAT)/Height Above Threshold (HATh) with reference to the ALS but may not descend below 100 ft above touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are distinctly visible and identifiable. Note 2:  The PF will announce his/her intentions to either land, continue, or go around.  Respond intention to “Land” if runway environment is in sight, will remain in sight throughout touchdown and the aircraft is in a position for a safe landing. 5.11.2.  Deviations: 5.11.2.1.  The PM will inform the PF when any of the following situations are observed and no attempt is being made to correct the deviation:  (T-2) 5.11.2.1.1.  Heading or airspeed deviations.  (T-2) 5.11.2.1.2.  Altitude deviation greater than 100 ft.  (T-2) 5.11.2.2.  Any crew member seeing a deviation of 200 ft altitude or 10 knots in airspeed, or a potential terrain or obstruction problem, will immediately notify the PF.  Deviations from prescribed procedures for the approach being flown will also be announced.  (T-2) 5.12.  Communications Policy. 5.12.1.  Aircraft Interphone: 5.12.1.1.  All  crew members will monitor the primary NET.  Crew members will notify the PIC before going off headset and advise when back on headset.  (T-2) 5.12.1.2.  Do not  discuss classified information  on the interphone during  unsecure  radio transmissions.  (T-2) 5.12.1.3.  Classified interphone or radio transmissions will be recorded on the CVR if it is operating.  Ensure the CVR remains on and running until the tape is clear of any recorded classified conversations.  (T-2) 5.12.1.4.  Non-aircrew  members  may  monitor  interphone  or  radio  transmissions  only when  specifically  approved  by  the  PIC.    The  PIC  will  brief  communications  policy  to these  personnel  prior  to  flight.    The  PIC  must  ensure  no  one  monitors  classified information  for  which  they  are  not  cleared  or  transmits  classified  information  over unsecure radios.  (T-2) 5.12.1.5.  Sterile Cockpit.  Limit conversation to that essential for crew coordination and mission  accomplishment  during  checklists,  taxi,  munitions  upload/download,  takeoff, weapons delivery, AAR, approach, landing, and any other critical phase of flight.  (T-2) 5.12.2.  Command Radios: 5.12.2.1.  The  PM  (or  designated  crew  member)  will  inform  the  crew  which  radio  is primary.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   33  5.12.2.2.  All crew members will monitor the primary radio unless specifically directed to do  otherwise  by  the  PIC  or  subsequent  chapters  of  this  instruction.    The  PIC  will designate crew members required to monitor other radios as required.  (T-2) 5.12.2.3.  During emergencies, request  simultaneous UHF and VHF transmissions when operating in a terminal area under radar control.  (T-2) 5.12.2.4.  One of the pilots  will record and read back all ATC clearances.   This may be disregarded  when  ATC  instructions  require  immediate  execution  or  when  such  action interferes with timely completion of more important duties.  All available crew members will  back  up  ATC  communications  for  accuracy,  unless  otherwise  directed  by  the  PIC.  (T-2) 5.12.2.5.  Communication  Reports.    Comply  with  mandatory  communication  and reporting procedures in the Flight Information Handbook.  (T-2) 5.13.  Pilot Proficiency with Munitions. 5.13.1.  AC-130Ws  may  conduct  pilot  proficiency  training  at  joint-use  or  military  (MIL) fields  with  munitions  on  board  provided  a  letter  of  agreement  between  the  OG/OGV  or COMAFSOF and airfield manager is on file.  A list of approved airfields will be published in local area procedures.  (T-2) 5.13.1.1.  If  an  emergency  situation  requires  landing  at  the  airfield,  the  PIC  will  ensure the aircraft is parked IAW Chapter 15, Table 15.2.  (T-2) 5.14.  Wind  Limitations.  Maximum  crosswind  limits  are  in  accordance  with  flight  manual limitations.    Remain  within  the  “recommended”  or  “caution”  areas  of  the  crosswind  charts  for normal  takeoffs  and  landings.    (T-2)    Simulated  engine  out  landings  (one  or  two  engine inoperative) must fall within the “Recommended” area unless otherwise approved by the Group Commander, or COMAFSOF (for contingency operations).  (T-3) 5.15.  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR)  and  Runway  Surface  Condition  (RSC):  The performance  charts  used  to  determine  braking  action  are  based  on  concrete  runways.    The runway  surface  should  be  considered  wet  when  water  on  the  runway  causes  a  reflective  glare.  The  RCR  values  for  the  following  runway  surfaces  in  Table  5.6  are  estimates  based  on operational experience and should be used only as a guide. Table 5.6.  RCR Values. TYPE SURFACE Asphalt Aluminum Matting M8A1/With Anti-Skid (Pierced Steel Planking (PSP)) M8A1/Without Anti-Skid (PSP) Clay Crushed Rock/Coral RCR (DRY) RCR (WET) 23 20 20 13 16 16 12 10 8 3 5 5   34  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 5.15.1.  Limit operations into and out of slush or water covered runways to a covering of one inch.  This number is based on performance charts where an RSC of 10 is equal to one inch of slush or water.  Performance data where more than one inch of slush or water is present may not be accurate.  (T-2) 5.16.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  Adhere  to  aircraft  wake  turbulence  avoidance  and separation criteria contained DoD FLIP planning (General Planning Chapter 5).  Acceptance of a visual or contact approach clearance, or instructions to follow an aircraft, is acknowledgment that the pilot will maintain a safe interval for wake turbulence avoidance.  (T-2) 5.17.  Runway  and  Taxiway  Requirements.  Use  normal  takeoff  and  landing  procedures whenever  practical.    For  mission  accomplishment,  if  approach  end  overruns  are  available  and stressed or authorized for normal operations, they may be used to increase the runway available for  takeoff.    All  speeds  and  distances  will  be  computed  “without  nose  wheel  steering.”    (T-2)  For  mission  accomplishment  the  PIC  may  authorize  “with  nose  wheel  steering”  corrections  on dry hard surfaced runways in lieu of downloading cargo/fuel.  Use of non-hard surfaced runways or taxiways requires Group Commander, or COMAFSOF approval.  (T-3) 5.17.1.  Normal Operations: 5.17.1.1.  Takeoff.  Minimum runway length is critical field length.  (T-2) 5.17.1.2.  Landing.    Minimum  runway  length  is  landing  distance  plus  the  following correction factors:  (T-2) 5.17.1.2.1.  Runway Visual Range (RVR) less than 40 (¾  mile)--add 1,000 ft. 5.17.1.2.2.  RVR equal to or greater than 40 (¾  mile)--add 500 ft. 5.17.1.2.3.  If  runway  length  available  for  landing  is  less  than  required  by  the previous criteria, crews may use landing ground roll plus 1,500 ft when approved by the squadron commander.  (T-3)  Landing touchdown must occur in the first 500 ft of the runway/landing surface.  (T-2) 5.17.1.3.  Minimum runway width is 60 ft or 19 meters.  (T-2) 5.17.1.4.  Minimum taxiway width is 30 ft or 9 meters.  (T-2) 5.18.  Aircraft Taxi and Taxi Obstruction Clearance Criteria. 5.18.1.  Do not taxi an aircraft within 25 ft of obstructions without wing walkers monitoring the clearance between aircraft and obstructions.  With wing walkers, avoid taxi obstructions by at least 10 ft.  (T-2)      Exception:  IAW AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operations and Movement on  the  Ground,  aircraft  may  taxi  without  marshallers/wing  walkers  at  home  station  along fixed taxi lines which have been measured to ensure a minimum of 10 ft clearance from any obstruction  and  the  obstruction  is  permanent.    Aerospace  Ground  Equipment  (AGE)  and vehicles  are  considered  a  permanent  obstruction  provided  it  is  parked  entirely  within  a designated area.  Areas will be designated by permanent markings such as painted boxes or lines  on  the  ramp  or  another  suitable  means.    Adjacent  aircraft  are  also  considered  a permanent obstruction, provided the aircraft is parked properly in its designated spot and is not moving.   (T-2) 5.18.2.  When taxi clearance is doubtful, use one or more wing walkers.  If wing walkers are not  available,  the  PIC  will  deplane  one  or  more  crew  members  to  maintain  obstruction AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   35  clearance  and  provide  marshaling  using  AFI  11-218  signals.    Use  wing  walkers,  deplaned crew members, or a crew member on interphone positioned at the paratroop door(s) to act as an  observer  while  maneuvering  on  narrow  taxiways.    During  night  taxi  operations, marshallers will have an illuminated wand in each hand.  Wing walkers are only required to have  one  illuminated  wand.    Observers  should  be  in  a  position  to  see  wing  walkers  at  all times (through door or windows) and communicate with the pilot.  (T-2) 5.18.3.  Use  low  speed  ground  idle  when  practical.    If  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD)  is  a problem,  the  outboard  engines  may  be  shut  down  provided  gross  weight,  taxiway,  and weather  are  favorable.    Verify  all  sources  of  brake  pressure  before  shutting  down symmetrical engines. 5.18.4.  After landing and clearing the runway, with approval of the pilot, the AG may open the  aft  cargo  door  and  lower  the  ramp  to  12  inches  above  horizontal,  to  prepare  for  ammo offload or onload provided all equipment, cargo, and passengers remain secured in the cargo compartment. 5.19.  Reverse  Taxi.  Use  extreme  caution  while  backing  the  aircraft  due  to  inherent  hazards.  (T-2) 5.19.1.  The pilot will coordinate engine status/utilization with the FE, and taxi directions and signals to be used with the AG and marshaller prior to commencing reverse taxi operations.  (T2) 5.19.2.  Secure all cargo and ensure all passengers are seated.  (T-2) 5.19.3.  Open  the  aft  cargo  door  and  lower  the  ramp  to  approximately  12  inches  above horizontal.  (T-2) 5.19.4.  The AG will be on the ramp in position to direct reverse taxi, report any hazards, and provide the pilot with timely interphone instructions on turns, distance remaining, condition of the maneuvering area, and stopping point.  (T-2) 5.19.5.  During  night  reverse  taxi  operations,  the  pilot  and  AG  will  ensure  that  visibility  in the  taxi  area  is  sufficient  to  conduct  safe  taxi  operations.    The  loading  lights,  retracted landing  lights,  NVGs,  or  any  other  source  that  provides  adequate  lighting  of  the  taxi  area may be used.  (T-2) 5.19.6.  Avoid all taxi obstructions, with or without a wing walker, by at least 25 ft.  (T-2) 5.19.7.  The  FE  will  primarily  monitor  engine  instruments  and  overheat  detection/warning systems for all engines.  (T-2) 5.19.8.  The  CP  will  primarily  monitor  outside  the  aircraft  and  backup  the  FE  on  engine instruments.  (T-2) 5.20.  Buddy and Windmill Taxi Starts.  Buddy and windmill taxi starts must be approved by the  Group  Commander  or  COMAFSOF.    Group  Commanders  may  delegate  this  authority  to their squadron or mission commander when the unit is deployed.  (T-3)  This authorization will not be construed to allow repeated buddy or windmill starts at various scheduled en route stops.  Load  all  remaining  crew  members  after  completion  of  the  windmill  taxi  start  IAW  applicable flight manual.  (T-2) 5.21.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Criteria.   36  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 5.21.1.  PICs  will  comply  with  the  ASRR  requirements  prior  to  operating  at  airfields classified as “special PIC airports” or “certification airfields” by the ASRR.  (T-2) 5.21.2.  An airfield is considered suitable for C-130 operations when: 5.21.2.1.  After  review  of  HQ  AMC/DOAS  ASRR  the  airfield  is  listed  as  suitable, see AFI 11202,  Vol  3  AFSOCSUP1,  Chapter  2.    Waiver  authority  for  the  ASRR  rests with the HQ AFSOC/A3.  (T-2) 5.21.2.2.  No obstructions or rising terrain  exceed the shaded areas of  Figure  5.1.  This ensures clearance only if the aircraft is maintained within 35 ft of runway centerline and a bank of five degrees is not exceeded.  (T-2) 5.21.2.3.  When an obstruction or terrain exceeds the shaded areas of Figure 5.1, specific approval  by  the  Wing  or  Group  Commander,  or  COMAFSOF  is  required  and  the  PIC must  be  advised  of  the  height  and  location  of  the  obstructions  as  well  as  specific procedures to avoid the obstruction (e.g., landing beyond obstacles).  (T-3) 5.21.3.  Figure 5  2 provides obstruction clearance criteria for ground operations.   It depicts maximum obstacle or terrain heights at specified distances to ensure clearance with the main landing  gear  on  the  edge  of  the  operating  surface.    PICs  will  be  advised  of  any  known obstructions that exceed the shaded areas.  (T-2) Figure 5.1.  Takeoff and Landing Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   37  Figure 5.2.  Ground Operations Obstruction Clearance Criteria.  5.22.  Inter.  Normally, initiate takeoffs from the beginning of the approved usable portion of the runway.  The decision to make intersection takeoffs rests solely with the PIC.  Base TOLD card computations on runway remaining from the point the takeoff is initiated.  (T-2) 5.23.  Reduced  Power  Operations.  Reduced power operations  are intended to  prolong engine service life and should be used any time maximum power is not required. 5.23.1.  During  proficiency  air  work  (flights  or  operations  that  are  mainly  confined  to  any local traffic pattern), when reduced power is used, Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) will not be less than 900º Celsius (C) for takeoff, not to exceed 19,600 inch-pounds of torque.  (T-2) 5.23.2.  Reduced  power  for  formation  takeoffs  to  a  torque  corresponding  to  no  less  than 1010º  C  TIT  for  takeoff.    Lead  will  reduce  power  to  970º  C  TIT  once  climb  speed  is obtained.  (T-2) 5.23.3.  Climb  power  to  cruise  altitude  will  be  1010º  C  TIT,  not  to  exceed  19,600  inch-pounds of torque, unless mission requirements dictate otherwise.  (T-2) 5.24.  Three-Engine  Takeoffs.  Actual  engine-out  takeoffs  require  HQ  AFSOC/A3  waiver.  (T2) 5.25.  Aircraft Recovery from Unprepared Surfaces.  Aircrews should not normally attempt to recover  an  aircraft  after  inadvertent  entry  onto  soft,  unprepared  surfaces  not  suitable  for  taxi.  Ground crews using the appropriate equipment will accomplish aircraft recovery.  Aircrews may accomplish recovery at austere locations if, after thorough inspection, the PIC is sure there is no damage and the surface will support the aircraft.  If there is damage or if there is any doubt that the surface will support the aircraft, aircrews will not attempt recovery.  (T-2)   38  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 5.26.  Engines  Running  Onload  or  Offload  (ERO).  Do  not  use  ERO  procedures  when explosive cargo is involved unless authorized by the Joint Airborne/Air Transportability Training (JA/ATT)  exercise  operation  order  or  contingency  Air  Tasking  Order  (ATO).    (T-2)     Exception:    Ordnance  intended  to  be  employed  by  the  aircraft  may  be  loaded  with  engines running IAW appropriate flight manual and local operating procedures. 5.26.1.  The  ERO  procedures  in  this  paragraph  may  be  used  for  any  mix  of  personnel  or cargo.  The aft cargo door and ramp is preferred when more than 10 passengers are involved.  The  PIC  will  assess  prevailing  weather,  lighting,  and  parking  location  to  ensure  a  safe operation.  (T-2) 5.26.2.  General Procedures: 5.26.2.1.  The PIC will brief crew members on the intended ERO operation, emphasizing specific crew member duties.  (T-2) 5.26.2.2.  The parking brake will be set and one pilot will monitor brakes, interphone, and radio.  (T-2) 5.26.2.3.  Operate  engines  in  ground  idle  (low  speed,  if  applicable).    If  conditions warrant,  open  air  deflector  door  and  lower  flaps  to  reduce  prop  or  jet  blast  aft  of  the aircraft.  (T-2) 5.26.2.4.  Turn wing leading edge lights on during night ERO.  Taxi lights may be used at the discretion of the PIC.  (T-2) 5.26.2.5.  Resume taxi after the AG has verbally acknowledged that the aircraft is ready for  taxiing.    Complete  passenger  and  cargo  manifests,  crew  lists  and  DD  Form  365-4, Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F,  for  the  subsequent  sortie.    (T-2)        Note:    DD Form 365-4 is not required for the subsequent sortie if the aircraft will depart empty. 5.26.2.6.  Do  not  onload  or  offload  through  two  different  doors  simultaneously.    (T-2)    WARNING:  Due to the hazards involved (i.e., propeller blast, proximity to engines and propellers, lack of paratroop door steps, etc.), only hand transferable items of cargo may be on/offloaded through the paratroop doors during EROs.  (T-2) 5.26.3.  Personnel onload and offload through the crew entrance door.  (T-2) 5.26.3.1.  The PIC will give clearance to open the crew entrance door.  (T-2) 5.26.3.2.  During enplaning and deplaning, station a crew member (normally the AG) on interphone (cord held taut) approximately 25 ft and at a 45 degree angle from the aircraft axis.  (T-2) 5.26.3.3.  Brief deplaning personnel to remain forward of the interphone cord.  (T-2) 5.26.4.  Personnel or cargo onload and offload through the aft cargo door and ramp.  (T-2) 5.26.4.1.  After clearance from the pilot, open the aft cargo door, and lower the ramp as required.  (T-2) 5.26.4.2.  The  AG  will  direct  all  onload  and  offload  operations.    Passengers  will  be escorted  by  a  crew  member  when  enplaning  or  deplaning.    Deplane  passengers  before cargo and enplane passengers after cargo unless cargo size or location dictates otherwise.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   39  5.26.5.  ERO  for  crew  changes  during  local  training  missions  is  authorized  provided  the enplaning  crew does not  approach the aircraft until  the deplaning AG is  in  position outside the aircraft.  Keep ERO for crew changes to the absolute minimum necessary to  accomplish the mission.  (T-2)   40  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Chapter 6 GENERAL OPERATING PROCEDURES Section 6A—Pre-Mission 6.1.

The  PIC  will  provide  the  obstacle  height,  distance,  and  gradient  information necessary for performance computations for the departure, alternate, and destination airfields to the FE.  As a minimum, review the appropriate terrain chart or sectional chart in addition to the SID (if applicable).  The FE will complete the AF IMT Form 4064 C-130 Takeoff and Landing  Data  Card,  and  the  AF  IMT  Form  4063  Mini  C-130  TOLD  Card,  in  accordance   44  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 with Chapter 12.  A pilot or additional FE will cross-check the AF IMT Form 4064/4063 for accuracy by using the performance manual, TOLD computer, or approved tabulated data.  As a minimum, the person checking the data will:  (T-2) 6.10.1.1.  Verify gross weight independently from the AF IMT Form 4063/4064.  (T-2) 6.10.1.2.  Cross-check air minimum control, takeoff, and landing speeds.  This should be done  for  the  initial  takeoff,  landing,  and  for  significant  changes  in  operating  conditions (e.g., flaps up, etc.).  (T-2) 6.10.1.3.  Review  and  compare  the  computed  distances,  ground  roll,  and  climb  gradient (if  applicable)  with  the  actual  conditions,  runway  available,  and  departure  procedures.  (T-2) 6.10.2.  Normally use reduced power for takeoffs provided Refusal Speed (Vr) is equal to or greater than takeoff speed.  Use normal takeoff power if Vr is less than takeoff speed.  (T-2) 6.10.3.  Flight Rules.  Comply with AFI 11-202, Vol 3 AFSOC Supplement 1, and AFMAN 11-217,    Vol  1/2  requirements  for:    Instrument  Flight  Rules  (IFR)  and  Visual  Flight  Rules (VFR) departures and arrivals; en route weather requirements; and weather requirements for departure, alternate, and destination airfields.  (T-2) 6.10.3.1.  VFR  Departures.    Comply  with  AFMAN  11-217,  Vol  2,  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3, and  the  following:    The  aircraft  must  be  capable  of  clearing  all  obstacles  along  the planned departure path or emergency return route with one engine inoperative.  When no higher climb gradient is required, the aircraft must always be able to climb at least 200 ft per minute on three engines at obstacle clearance speed.  When no obstacle exists on the planned  departure,  plan  climb  out  to  1,000  ft  Above  Ground  Level  (AGL)  or  pattern altitude whichever is higher.  (T-2) 6.11.  Airfield Review.  Accomplish review IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 and AFSOC Supplement 1.  (T-2) 6.12.  Intelligence Briefing.  Before departing on missions outside the United States, crews will receive  an  intelligence  briefing  that  will  emphasize  terrorist,  enemy,  and  friendly  political  and military  development  in  the  area  in  which  they  will  be  operating.    In  theater,  aircrews  should receive  intelligence  updates  on  initial  arrival  at  a  forward  operating  location,  or  en  route  stop, and thereafter when significant developments occur.  Report information of possible intelligence value to the local intelligence officers at the completion of each mission.  (T-2) 6.13.  Authenticators  and  Classified  Material.  Obtain  and  safeguard  current  authenticators and other classified materials required for the area being transited.  Carry authenticators and IFF Mode  IV  codes  when  flying  into  an  Air  Defense  Identification  Zone  (ADIZ),  participating  in exercises, on overseas missions, deployments, and when specified in operation plans.  (T-2) 6.13.1.  The Communications Security (COMSEC) material required depends on the theater of  operation  and  user.    The  base  COMSEC  custodian  can  assist  in  obtaining  the  material required  for the mission.  Base  Operations at  AMC bases maintains the COMSEC  material used on most missions. 6.13.2.  Turn in authenticators and other classified materials at your ultimate destination and obtain receipts for classified material.  Command and Control Center will provide temporary storage for authenticators/classified materials during ground time at en route stops.  Issue and AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   45  turn-in  of  authenticators  is  normally  a  function of Base  Operations.  At locations where no storage facilities exist, classified materials may be stored in the aircraft safe, if available.  (T-2) 6.13.2.1.

Anytime  wind  shear  may  be  encountered  on  departure  or  approach,  it  is recommended that aircrews select wind shear mode on a radar display. 6.16.1.2.  The  PIC  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  passengers  are  seated,  with  seat  belts fastened,  when  areas  of  moderate  or  greater  turbulence  are  encountered  or  anticipated.  (T-2)      WARNING:  Serious injury may occur if passengers do not have their seat belts fastened and the aircraft encounters moderate or severe turbulence. 6.16.2.  Flight  into  areas  of  forecast  or  reported  severe  icing  is  prohibited.    Prolonged operation, such as cruise flight or holding, in areas of moderate icing should be avoided.  (T-2) 6.16.2.1.  Do not takeoff under conditions of freezing rain or freezing drizzle.  (T-2) 6.16.2.2.  Freezing  precipitation,  snow,  freezing  fog  (consider  equivalent  to  moderate icing),  or  temperatures  near  0°C,  may  cause  ice  or  frost  to  accumulate  on  aircraft surfaces.    When  an  aircraft  requires  de-icing/anti-icing  prior  to  takeoff,  refer  to  the following: 6.16.2.2.1.  Aircrews will only use de-ice and anti-ice fluids listed in their respective flight  manual.    Aircrews  will  be  familiar  with,  and  follow  all  restrictions  in  their associated  flight  manual  with  respect  to  anti-ice/de-ice  procedures  and  holdover times.  (T-2) 6.16.2.2.2.  Military (MIL)-A-8243 Type I and Type II de-icing fluids do not provide any  antiicing  benefit,  and  therefore  do  not  have  holdover  times.    As  a  guide,  for approved  anti-icing  fluids,  crews  may  use  published  anti-icing  holdover  times  IAW TO 42C-1-2, Aircraft Anti-icing Procedures, and AFFSA holdover tables are located at  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/AFFSA/A3O/A3OF/Forms/AllItems.aspx.   The holdover time begins when anti-icing fluid is first applied and the PIC shall use time, temperature,  and  dilution  of  mixture  to  determine  when  times  are  exceeded  and reapply fluid if required. 6.16.2.2.3.  In  all  cases,  PICs  will  ensure  a  visual  inspection  of  the  aircraft  is completed within 5 minutes of departure.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   47  6.16.3.  Do not  fly  directly above (within  2,000 ft) thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds.  If unable to clear thunderstorms or cumulonimbus clouds by at least 2,000 ft vertically, avoid them by at least:  (T-2) 6.16.3.1.  20 nm at or above flight level (FL) 230. 6.16.3.2.  10 nm  below  FL 230.         CAUTION:  Aircraft damage may  occur 20 nm  or more  from  any  thunderstorms.    Aircrews  must  familiarize  themselves  with  information on thunderstorm development and hazards.  Refer to AFH 11-203, Weather for Aircrews. 6.16.4.  The use of ground-based radar as a means of thunderstorm avoidance should only be used to assist in departing an inadvertently penetrated area of significant weather.   It should never  be  considered  a  normal  avoidance  procedure.    When  relying  exclusively  on  ground-based radar for weather avoidance, and the ground controller is unable to provide avoidance instructions, attempt to maintain VMC by: 6.16.4.1.  Changing routing. 6.16.4.2.  Diverting to an alternate location. 6.16.4.3.  Declaring an emergency and requesting priority assistance. Section 6E—Pre-flight 6.17.  Operational Risk Management (ORM).  ORM is a logic based, common sense approach to  making  calculated  decisions  on  human,  material,  and  environmental  factors  before,  during, and  after  all  operations.    USAF  policy  on  ORM  is  contained  in  Air  Force  Policy  Directive (AFPD)  90-9,  Operational  Risk  Management.    PICs  will  accomplish  ORM  worksheets  IAW AFSOC/MAJCOM and local guidance as part of preflight activities.  (T-2) 6.17.1.  Flying  units  will  develop  a  local  ORM  program  to  include  personal  ORM  risk assessment for all missions.  (T-2) 6.17.2.  The PIC will ensure an ORM risk assessment is accomplished by all crew members as part of preflight activities.  (T-2) 6.18.  C-130 Dash One Preflight. 6.18.1.  The  aircrew  Dash  One  preflight  inspection,  once  completed,  is  valid  for  72  hours provided the aircraft is either sealed or continuously monitored by squadron personnel.  (T-2) 6.18.2.  When  an  aircrew  assumes  a  preflighted  spare  or  quick-turn,  a  thorough  visual inspection will be performed, paying particular attention to areas affected by maintenance or servicing.  (T2) 6.18.3.  Dash  One  preflight  inspections  are  normally  done  in  preparation  for  flight  by  the aircrew  assigned  to  fly  the  mission  designated  for  that  aircraft.    Do  not  schedule  pre-flight crews  to  perform  pre-flight  inspections  on  primary  aircraft  for  local  training  flights.    (T-2)       Exception:    Preflight  crews  may  be  scheduled  to  preflight  aircraft  during  Operational Readiness Exercises (OREs), Consolidated Unit Inspections (CUIs), and contingencies. 6.18.4.  The following  guidelines apply to  aircrew assigned to  preflight and/or seal  aircraft.  Crew members will not preflight more than 4 aircraft in a 12-hour period or perform preflight duties  for  more  than  12  hours.    Crew  rest  according  to  AFI  11-202  Vol3  is  required.    48  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Aircrews  performing  preflight  duties  will  be  afforded  12  hours  crew  rest  between  preflight shifts.  (T-2) 6.18.4.1.  Duty  Not  Including/Involving  Flight  (DNIF)  crew  members  may  accomplish preflights only with the concurrence of the flight surgeon.  It is the responsibility of the crew  member  to  know  his/her  duty  limitations.    If  possible  crew  members  should  have the  flight  surgeon  document  the  AF  Form  1042  appropriately  IAW  with  AFI  48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards, Vol 3.  (T-2) 6.18.5.  Unqualified crew members may not preflight aircraft except under the supervision of an instructor.  (T-2) 6.19.  AFTO  Form  781.  Review the AFTO Form 781 before applying power to the aircraft or operating  aircraft  systems.    The  Exceptional  Release  (ER)  must  be  signed  before  taxi.    A maintenance officer, maintenance superintendent, or authorized civilian normally signs the ER.  If one of these individuals is not available, the PIC may sign the ER.  Ensure that the DD 1896, Jet Fuel Identiplate and AIR card are on board the aircraft.  (T-2) 6.20.  Authority to Clear a Red X.  Aircrew are not normally authorized to clear a Red X.  In a situation where the aircraft is on a Red X and qualified maintenance personnel are unavailable, the PIC or FE may obtain authorization to clear the Red X from the home station Maintenance Group  (MXG)/CC  or  designated  representative  in  accordance  with  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.  (T-2) 6.20.1.  At  en  route  stations,  FE’s  are  authorized  to  sign  off  Red  X  symbols  for intake/exhaust inspections, dust covers and plugs installed, and aircraft panels removed and installed to facilitate other maintenance when qualified personnel are not available.  (T-2) 6.20.2.  Other crew members are not authorized to clear a Red X.  (T-2) 6.21.  In-Process  Inspections.  FEs must be aware of their responsibility to perform in-process inspections  when  clearing  Red  X  symbols.    During  the  assembly  or  reassembly  of  an  item  at those  stages  where  further  assembly  will  prevent  the  required  inspection  of  the  item,  an  in-process  inspection  will  be  performed.    The  inspection  will  be  documented  IAW  TO  00-20-1, Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures.  (T-2) 6.22.  One-Time Flights.  An aircraft may be released for a one-time flight with a condition that might be hazardous for continued use, provided the aircraft is airworthy for one flight to a repair station.    Refer  to  TO  00-20-1,  Aerospace  Equipment  Maintenance  Inspection,  Documentation, Policies,  and  Procedures,  for  Red-X  downgrade  authority  and  procedures.    (T-2)    One-time flight  approval  authority  is  OG/CC  or  COMAFSOF.    (T-3)    The  owning  MXG/CC  (or designated official), the senior maintenance officer, or the chief of the AFMC repair team must first  authorize  the  release.    After  the  maintenance  release  is  obtained,  contact  OG/CC,  via stan/eval channels, for flight authorization.  The PIC's concurrence is required before the aircraft can be flown.  (T-2) 6.23.  Alert Aircraft Procedures.  Maintain aircraft on alert status as follows:  (T-2) 6.23.1.  Park the aircraft in a designated alert parking area to expedite taxi and takeoff.  (T-2) 6.23.2.  Aircraft  preflight  times  should  align  the  alert  period  and  aircraft  preflight  validity period,  eliminating  the  need  to  update  the  preflight  during  the  alert  period.    Whenever operationally feasible, have a crew other than the alert crew preflight the alert aircraft. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   49  6.23.3.  The alert aircraft may be flown for purposes other than actual alert missions provided the following conditions are met:  (T-2) 6.23.3.1.  Ensure sufficient fuel remains on board to meet alert commitments. 6.23.3.2.  Maintain communications with the primary controlling agency. 6.23.3.3.  If  maintenance  actions  are  not  required,  the  aircraft  can  be  resealed  for  alert once  the  through-flight  inspection  is  completed.    In  all  cases,  a  new  preflight  is  not required until the end of the initial preflight period. 6.23.4.  A DD Form 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance, Form F, will be prepared for the alert  aircraft.    Alert  crews  are  authorized  to  prepare  a  TOLD  card  using  the  worst  weather conditions  expected  for  the  alert  period.    Use  the  TOLD  for  alert  scrambles.    If  the  alert aircraft is flown for other reasons, use TOLD for the existing weather conditions.  (T-2) 6.23.5.  If the alert aircraft is changed to a different, preflighted/sealed aircraft, the preflight or alert crew will, as a minimum, apply power to the aircraft and check the following systems (as applicable):  (T-2) 6.23.5.1.  AFTO Form 781, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Data Record. 6.23.5.2.  Interior and exterior for proper configuration and special equipment. 6.23.5.3.  Fuel quantity. 6.23.5.4.  Survival and emergency equipment. 6.23.5.5.  Navigation and communication equipment. 6.23.5.6.  Liquid oxygen quantity. 6.23.5.7.  Hydraulic reservoirs and accumulator charges. 6.23.5.8.  Publications. 6.23.6.  When  an  aircraft  remains  on  alert  for  more  than  72  hours,  a  complete  aircrew preflight is then required.  (T-2) 6.23.7.  Once  the  aircraft  is  accepted  for  alert,  the  FE  will  ensure  an  entry  is  made  in  the AFTO Form 781H, Aerospace Vehicle Flight Report and Maintenance Document, stating as a minimum, the date and time the aircraft was preflighted.  (T-2) 6.23.8.  Alert  aircraft  are  off  limits  to  all  personnel  except  alert  crew  members.    No maintenance  may  be  performed  on  the  aircraft  without  the  approval  of  the  unit/mission commander.

If conducted, the appropriate -1 procedures will be used.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   51  6.24.6.  Propulsion System Checks (Engine Runs).  When conducting maintenance-requested propulsion system checks, comply with the following:  (T-2) 6.24.6.1.  Prior to conducting the checks, complete an ORM assessment and review risk mitigation  actions.    The  minimum  crew  complement  for  the  checks  will  be  the  crew complement required for aircraft taxi.  Start  with the preflight  checklist  and accomplish all checklists through before leaving the aircraft checklist.  (T-2) 6.24.6.2.  During the propulsion system checks, follow normal flight manual procedures and limitations (do not combine maintenance procedures/limitations into the checks).  Set power as requested and relay instrument readings, but limit troubleshooting to the scope of the aircraft flight manual.  Checks requiring Functional Check Flight (FCF) procedures will be performed by FCF-qualified crews.  (T-2) 6.24.6.3.  When conducting propulsion system checks in areas of reduced traction, ensure all personnel on board are seated with lap belts fastened.  (T-2) 6.24.7.  Towing.  Aircrew members will not normally participate in towing operations.  The PIC  will  coordinate  with  the  senior  maintenance  officer  or  superintendent  to  ensure  the towing  supervisor  and  crew  are  qualified.    At  non-USAF  installations,  the  PIC  must  have approval from the airfield operations officer or manager prior to towing.  The PIC will ensure the  tow  team  supervisor  briefs  all  personnel  on  their  duties  and  the  associated  hazards.  Proper  checklists  will  be  used.    If  any  doubt  exists  as  to  the  qualification  of  tow  team personnel  or the safety of the operation, make no attempt to  tow the aircraft until  qualified Air Force personnel  can be located.   Under no  circumstances  will any  crew member act  as the towing supervisor.  (T-2) 6.24.8.  When  thunderstorms  are  reported  within  10  nm  of  the  airfield,  only  operations leading to an immediate engine start and departure may continue.  However, personnel must be  prepared  to  cease  all  activities  in  the  event  lightning  within  5  nm  is  declared.    When advised  of  lightning  within  5  nm  of  the  airfield,  all  flightline  activities  will  cease  and personnel will seek shelter.  Unless an immediate takeoff is a safer course of action, taxiing aircraft will return to parking.  (T-2) 6.24.8.1.  Munitions  loading  will  not  be  initiated,  unless  it  can  be  completed  before lightning  becomes  a  hazard.    If  munitions  loading  has  begun  and  lightning  becomes  a hazard, the crew will cease loading and depart the flightline/hot cargo area.  Ensure that the Command Post notifies security forces that there will be an unattended aircraft with munitions.  Unless immediate takeoff is a safer course of action, any taxiing aircraft with munitions  aboard  will  return  to  hot  cargo  area  or  other  approved  parking  location  if lightning is declared within 5 nm.  (T-2) 6.24.8.2.  Aircraft taxiing to parking or hot cargo area when lightning is declared within 5 nm should not expect a marshaller.  The aircrew will hold in place or proceed to parking if clearance is assured.  Seek shelter or remain in the aircraft if safer.  Time permitting, coordinate  with  Base  Operations  (Pilot  to  Dispatcher  frequency)  if  the  aircraft  will  be parked  in  any  location  other  than  one  assigned  by  the  Air  Mobility  Control  Center (Maintenance Operations Control Center) through the Command Post.

Each crew member will fit a parachute and have it readily available prior to all  weapons  delivery,  combat,  contingency  and  FCF  missions.    Units  will  dictate  use  of parachutes during acceptance flights.  (T-2) 6.25.4.  Restraint Harness.  Personnel performing in-flight duties near an open door will wear a  parachute  or  restraining  harness.    Wear  a  restraining  harness  during  all  open  door operations  below  1,000  ft  AGL.    Fit  the  restraint  harness  and  adjust  the  lifeline  prior  to stations time.  Note:  Connect the hook to a point that will preclude the wearer from exiting the aircraft.  Connect the lifeline when at or anticipating moving aft of flight station (FS) 677.  (T-2)     WARNING:  Position one restraint harness forward and aft of FS 245 in event the crew entrance door must be inspected during flight.  (T-2) 6.25.5.  Survival Kits/Vests. 6.25.5.1.  All AC-130W aircraft will be configured with one survival kit (ML-4) for each aircrew member.  Survival vests may be used in  lieu of survival kits  if the mission will not take them beyond gliding distance of land.  (T-2) 6.25.5.2.  All  crew  members  will  have  individual  survival  vests  readily  available,  and should  wear  them  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  during  combat  and  contingency missions.    The  PIC  will  determine  minimum  wear  requirements  based  on  threat assessment, mission, and crew considerations.  (T-2) 6.25.6.  Rafts.    Ensure  sufficient  wing  well  life  rafts  are  on  board  to  accommodate  all personnel on overwater flights.  (T-2) 6.25.7.  Life Preserver Unit (LPU): 6.25.7.1.  Ensure sufficient quantities of life preservers are on board for all personnel for overwater  flights.    While  overwater,  LPUs  will  be  sized  and  available  at  the  crew member’s station, and worn whenever below 2,000 ft overwater (except for takeoff and landing).  (T-2) 6.25.7.2.  If overwater and the mission requires wear of the parachute, the LPU will also be worn.  (T-2) 6.25.8.  Anti-exposure  suits.    Anti-exposure  suits  will  be  available  during  overwater  flights when  route  of  flight  is  beyond  power  off  gliding  distance  from  land  and  the  water temperature is 60º Fahrenheit (F) or below.  (T-2)     Exception:  Anti-exposure suits are not required when only the approach or departure is flown overwater).  If the water temperature ranges  between  51º  F  and  60º  F,  the  unit  or  mission  commander  may  waive  or  extend  the anti-exposure suit requirement after carefully considering the following factors: 6.25.8.1.

(T-2)  Exception:    Aircrews  will  ensure  they  have  an  operable  Mode  4  prior  to  departure  if  the aircraft will transit an area where safe passage procedures are implemented or when required for mission accomplishment.  (T-2) 6.27.5.  Mode S.  Mode S equipped aircraft have the capability of assigning a unique default code that is associated with a specific aircraft registration as well as the flight identification that corresponds to the filed flight plan call sign. 6.27.5.1.  Military  aircraft  have  the  ability  to  change  the  Mode  S  and  Flight  ID  codes.  Erroneous  Mode  S  codes  and/or  Flight  ID  mismatch  to  filed  aircraft  identification degrade  the  safety  and  efficiency  of  air  traffic  control.    Inadvertent  duplication  of  an address will seriously degrade or even disable ETCAS operability. 6.27.5.2.  Aircrew  and  squadron  operations  staff  must  ensure  that  the  assigned/unique Mode S address (default code) be loaded in to the transponder correctly.  Flight plan filed call signs must match exactly to the Flight ID inserted into the transponder.  There will be neither leading zeros nor spaces/dashes ahead of or between the characters entered in the Flight ID.  If the call sign is less than 7 characters, the inserted Flight ID will have spaces only at the end.  This procedure is IAW DoD FLIP General Planning.  (T-2) 6.27.5.3.  Ensure  Mode  S  operation  is  IAW  the  aircraft  flight  manual.    Due  to  its importance,  anytime  a  Mode  S  code  is  entered,  it  will  be  verified  by  a  second  crew member.  (T-2) 6.28.  Cargo Documentation.   56  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 6.28.1.  AC-130W  aircraft  do  not  normally  transport  cargo  through  normal  AMC  channels.  If tasked to do so, ensure proper cargo documentation  accompanies each load when possible.  Proper  cargo  documentation  should  include  a  load  plan,  cargo  manifest,  and  any  special handling documentation (i.e., registered mail, perishable cargo).  Additionally all hazardous cargo  will  be  accompanied  by  a  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods  IAW  AFMAN  24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment.  (T-2) 6.29.  Dropped  Object  Prevention.  During  aircraft  exterior  visual  inspections,  pay  particular attention to  surfaces, panels,  and components which could  potentially be dropped objects.    If a dropped object is discovered and the mission is continued, the flight crew will:  (T-2) 6.29.1.  Ensure the write-up is entered in the AFTO Form 781A. 6.29.2.  Notify  the  AFSOC  Command  Center  as  soon  as  practical.    Include  route  of  flight, altitude, and weather (i.e., turbulence, etc.). 6.30.  Narcotics.  Crew  members  will  ensure  narcotics  and  other  unauthorized  items  are  not smuggled on board the aircraft.  (T-2) 6.31.  Flight Deck Congestion and Loose Objects. 6.31.1.

A subcategory of space-required passenger defined by this instruction as US and foreign military, DoD civilians, and US civilian employees under contract  to  the  DoD,  who  directly  support  the  mission  or  a  deployment  of  an  AFSOC unit.  This may include, but is not limited to; maintenance, communications, intelligence, logistics,  fuels,  and  flight  test  personnel,  unit-supporting  chaplains,  civilian  contractors   58  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 required  for  in-flight  checks  or  deployment  support,  Federal  Aviation  Administration (FAA)  representatives,  STS,  fire  support  officers,  and  other  military  personnel  who  are on  board  to  communicate/coordinate  with  ground  forces.    Off-station  travel  is documented by travel orders.  Flights will be documented by letter of authorization from the Group CC or COMAFSOF.  Squadron Commanders may approve squadron assigned personnel or maintenance personnel required for mission accomplishment.  18 Flight Test Squadron/CC  is  the  approval  authority  for  supporting  forces  in  conjunction  with  test missions.    When  frequent  local  flights  are  necessary,  commanders  may  issue  annual authorizations  by  name  or  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  as  appropriate.    When  using  this option, PICs will ensure that all restrictions in the following paragraph are complied with for each individual mission.  Manifest all supporting forces on a DD Form 2131.  (T-2) 6.32.5.2.1.  Restrictions.  Both pilots must be fully qualified unless excepted by AFI 11-401.  Simulated EPs are prohibited.  There are no restrictions on mission events.  Passengers  will  be  seated  with  belts  fastened  during  threat  maneuvers.    PICs  will ensure  that  supporting  forces  are  briefed  on  the  mission  profile  and  mission  events before  flight.    (T-2)              Exception:    EPs  required  for  the  purposes  of  a  FCF  are authorized.  Limit personnel to absolute minimum required.  (T-2) 6.33.  Military Customs Preclearance Inspection Program. 6.33.1.  The  military  customs  program  was  developed  to  assist  the  DoD  and  other  US Government  agencies  in  the  control  of  narcotics,  contraband,  and  prohibited  agricultural products, and to expedite entry of DoD personnel and material into the customs territory of the United States. 6.33.2.  Military  Customs  Inspectors  will  accomplish  this  inspection  immediately  prior  to departure  and  may  conduct  more  than  one  pre-clearance  inspection  on  CONUS  bound aircraft.    When  security  considerations  necessitate  deviation  from  this  policy,  mission planners  must  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  agency  to  ensure  the  mission  is  not jeopardized.  (T-2) Section 6F—Departure 6.34.  Engine Run-Up/Propulsion Checks. 6.34.1.  An  engine  propulsion  check  may  be  performed  anytime  the  crew  deems  necessary.  If  95%  engine  efficiency  cannot  be  obtained  on  all  engines,  the  aircraft  will  not  be  flown.  Accomplish the check IAW the specific flight manual.  (T-2) 6.34.1.1.  Request  clearance  from  the  ground  or  tower  controller  prior  to  an  engine propulsion check.  Advise controller when prop wash will cross the runway.  (T-2) 6.34.1.1.1.

At no time will an engine run-up be attempted (throttles out of the ground range)  unless  the  aircraft  is  in  an  approved  engine  run-up  site  (per  Base Operations/Fixed  Base  Operator)  or  the  active  runway.    (T-2)                      Note:    ATC clearance does not constitute a safe environment for an engine run-up.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   59  6.34.1.1.3.  Using the MDS flight manual danger areas figure, ensure the area behind the  aircraft  is  clear  before  starting  an  engine  run-up.    (T-2)             WARNING:    Prop blast  from  engine  run-ups/propulsion  systems  checks  is  hazardous  to  people, buildings, equipment, and other aircraft. 6.34.1.1.4.  If an engine run-up/propulsion systems check was not accomplished, the first takeoff of the day will be static to allow for an engine efficiency check.  (T-2) 6.34.2.  The  propeller  static  feather  check  procedure  is  normally  considered  a  periodic maintenance function; however, if the FE elects to perform this procedure, ensure engine oil temperature is 20º C or greater.  (T-2) 6.35.  Ground Collision Avoidance System Operation.  Operate the GCAS in the normal mode (Audio  On  and  Visual  On)  for  all  non-tactical  operations.    Crews  may  override  the  flap/glide slope advisory during the approach to landing as long as the alert is acknowledged by both pilots.  (T-2) 6.36.  Traffic  Collision  Avoidance  System  TCAS/ETCAS  Operations.  Use the above/below/normal  settings  as  appropriate  for  the  phase  of  flight  and  mission.    The  “below” setting should be used for tactical descents.  (T-2) 6.37.  Power  Application.  To  help  prevent  over-torque,  the  FE  will  make  a  call  over  the interphone any time torque reaches 17,000 in-lb.  Pilots and FEs will monitor torque as throttles are  advanced.    (T-2)                  CAUTION:    The  M2  sensor  will  be  stowed  for  takeoff.    It  can  be returned to normal operation when airborne.  (T-2) 6.38.  Departure  Monitoring.  The PM and Navigator (NAV) will back up the pilot and report any deviations from  the  planned departure.  When radar facilities are  available, departures will be radar monitored to the maximum extent possible.  (T-2) 6.39.  Flight  Progress.  Use  all  available  navigational  aids  to  maintain  course  centerline  and positive fixing of the aircraft’s position.  (T-2) 6.40.  Navigation Aid Capability.  Refer to Chapter 4 for minimum navigation capabilities. 6.40.1.  North Atlantic Region and the US West Coast/Hawaii Route System.  Aircraft must have an operable INS/GPS/Self-Contained Navigation System (SCNS) prior to airspace/track entry.  Aircraft without this equipment must return to a station with maintenance capability or re-file via routes specified in FLIP.  (T-2) 6.40.2.  North  Pacific  (NOPAC)  Region.    Comply  with  the  following  procedures  when transiting  the  Anchorage/Tokyo  Oceanic  Control  Area/Flight  Information  Region  (FIR)  on the NOPAC north route:  (T-2) 6.40.2.1.  Westbound  aircraft  on  the  NOPAC  north  route  experiencing  loss  of  radar capability at any point shall, fuel permitting, refile a flight plan on another track or return to the nearest facility with radar maintenance capability.  (T-2) 6.40.2.2.  Westbound  aircraft  on  the  NOPAC  north  route  that  have  a  single  drift  and groundspeed  source  and  experience  loss  of  that  source  at  any  point,  may  continue  the NOPAC north route if the radar system is fully operable.  Verify in-flight that satisfactory returns  are  being  received  on  all  ranges,  particularly  the  longer  ranges  (100  nm  or   60  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 greater).    If  the  radar  system  is  marginal  or  inoperative,  fuel  permitting,  refile  a  flight plan to another track or return to the nearest facility with maintenance capability.  (T-2) 6.41.  Communications  Instructions  Reporting  Vital  Intelligence  Sightings  and  Other Reports.  Refer  to  AFI  10-206,  Operational  Reporting.    Report  all  vital  intelligence  sightings from aircraft as indicated in the FLIP Planning or FIH.  (T-2) 6.42.  In-Flight Meals.  The P and CP will not consume meals within 90 minutes of each other, before or during flight, if the meals were procured from the same vendor and consist of the same menu.  (T-2) 6.43.  In-Flight  Emergency  Procedures.  Report  deviations  from  directives  that  occur  as  a result of an emergency IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 and this instruction.  (T2) 6.43.1.  Notification  of  Controlling  Agencies.    As  soon  as  practical  after  completing  the aircraft emergency action checklist, furnish the controlling agency and appropriate command, control,  and  communications  (C3)  a  description  and  extent  of  the  difficulty,  assistance required, intentions, and any further pertinent information.  (T-2) 6.43.2.  Emergency  Landing.    Aircrews  must  be  prepared  to  divert  to  the  nearest  suitable airfield.  The NAV (PM if the NAV is unable to return to the flight deck) must be ready to provide pertinent information including headings, distance, and frequencies.  (T-2) 6.43.3.  Conference  HOTEL.    Lockheed  Martin’s  In-flight  Conference  HOTEL  personnel can  be  contacted  by  calling  the  Warner  Robins  Air  Logistics  Center  Command  Post  at  the phone  numbers  listed  in  Table  6.5.    They  are  manned  24  hrs/day  and  are  tasked  with arranging contact  between operational  units and  appropriate WR-ALC Personnel,  including management level as well as technical.

The PIC may initiate the conference when additional expertise is necessary to cope  with  emergencies  or  other  conditions.    It  convenes  at  the  lowest  level  where expertise is available, and will not be elevated for the purpose of keeping the next higher echelon informed. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   61  6.43.3.2.  Technical Assistance Service.  The PIC may request (at anytime in the decision process)  technical  support  and  additional  assistance  from  their  home  unit,  MAJCOM staff, maintenance representatives, and/or civilian contractor support. 6.43.3.3.  When in  UHF or VHF range, initiate the conference over appropriate discrete frequencies.  When out of VHF or UHF range, use HF radios to establish a phone patch with  the  nearest  or  controlling  C3.    Provide  a  narrative  description  of  the  situation including actions taken, intentions, and type of expertise desired.  (T-2) 6.43.4.  Turnaround Procedures.  Use procedures IAW FLIP.  (T-2) 6.43.5.  Continued  Flight  with  Engine  Loss.    A  flight  may  proceed  on  three  engines  to  its destination  if  two-engine  capability  exists,  favorable  operating  conditions  prevail  both  en route and at the point of intended landing, and a suitable alternate airfield is available at all times.    If  these  conditions  cannot  be  met,  the  flight  will  terminate  at  the  nearest  facility (preferably military) which, in the judgment of the PIC, offers safe and favorable operating conditions.  (T2) 6.43.6.  Fuel  Jettisoning.    Fuel  will  not  be  jettisoned  except  for  combat  conditions, emergency conditions, or rescue missions requiring gross weight reduction.  (T-2) 6.43.6.1.  Advise ATC should it become necessary to jettison fuel.  (T-2) 6.44.  Medical  Assistance.  When a person on board the aircraft requires medical  care the PIC will inform the station of next intended landing in sufficient time so medical personnel may meet the aircraft.  The request will include the individual’s sex, approximate age, and the nature of the medical problem.  (T-2) 6.44.1.  Suspected  Laser  Exposure.    If  exposed  to  a  laser,  the  PIC  will  ensure  appropriate command  and  control,  intelligence,  safety,  and  medical  agencies  are  notified  as  soon  as possible.    Aircrew  who  suspect  exposure  to  laser  radiation  from  either  friendly  or  hostile sources  should  report  to  the  Flight  Surgeon’s  Office  or  nearest  emergency  room  where individual can be examined by an ophthalmologist immediately upon landing.  (T-2) Section 6G—Arrival 6.45.  Crew  Coordination.  The PF the approach will brief the crew on  the descent,  approach, and  landing  IAW  the  flight  manual  and/or  SOG/OGV  approved  briefing  guides.    The  PM  and NAV will monitor the approach and report any deviations from prescribed procedures.  (T-2) 6.46.  Flight Instrumentation Requirements and Procedures. 6.46.1.  Flight  Instrumentation  Requirements.    If  full  flight  instrumentation  is  not  available and operational, aircraft are limited to a DA or MDA based on a HAT of 300 ft and RVR 40, or ¾ mile visibility (1,220 meters) with no RVR.  (T-2) 6.46.1.1.  Full flight instrumentation for a Category (CAT) I ILS consists of:  dual flight displays,  complete  differential  pressure  instruments,  heading/compass  systems,  and attitude direction indicators (ADI) in the P and CP positions.  (T-2) 6.46.1.2.  Full  flight  instrumentation  for  a  precision  approach  radar  (PAR)  consists  of:  complete differential pressure instruments, heading/compass systems, and ADIs in the P and CP positions.  (T-2)   62  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 6.47.  After Beginning an En Route Descent.  IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 after starting an en route descent and the weather is reported or observed to be below approach minimums, the PIC has the option  of  continuing  the  approach  to  the  MAP/DH.    Comply  with  the  last  assigned  clearance until a new or amended clearance is received.  (T-2) 6.48.  Coupled  Approach  Procedures.  When  a  coupled  approach  is  flown,  assume  manual control at or above published MDA or DH.  (T-2) 6.49.  Self-Contained Approaches (SCA).  Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) SCAs are operational procedures not normally intended for publication in FLIP. 6.49.1.  All  IMC  SCAs  must  conform  to  the  criteria  specified  in  AFI  11-230,  Instrument Procedures,  and  be  approved  through  stan/eval  channels  by  the  HQ  AFSOC/A3.    Refer  to SCA construction guidelines in Chapter 11 of this volume and SCA procedures in Chapter 15 of this volume.  (T-2) 6.50.  Radar  Altimeter  Procedures.  Set  the  radar  altimeters  to  the  HAT  or  height  above aerodrome for the approach being flown in accordance with the flight manual.  Pilots and NAVs will crosscheck radar altimeters during descent to ensure adequate terrain clearance is provided throughout  the  descent  and  maneuvering  portion  of  the  approach.    Once  established  in  a  VFR traffic pattern, the radar altimeter may be set at the discretion of the pilot.  (T-2) 6.51.  Wake  Turbulence  Avoidance.  Pilots  must  exercise  the  discipline  necessary  to  ensure wake turbulence avoidance criteria are observed during flight operations.  Acceptance of a visual or contact  approach  clearance, or instructions to  follow an aircraft, is  acknowledgment  that the pilot  will  maintain  a  safe  interval  for  wake  turbulence  avoidance.    The  following  instructions expand wake turbulence avoidance criteria, but do not replace guidance in DoD FLIP planning (General Planning Chapter 5).  (T-2) 6.51.1.  For  VFR  traffic  patterns  behind  heavy  jets  follow  the  “Vortex  Avoidance Procedures” in FLIP General Planning.  (T-2) 6.51.2.  Low  approaches  behind  heavy  jets  will  be  flown  no  lower  than  that  altitude  which ensures the aircraft remains well above the flight path of the heavy jet.  (T-2) 6.51.3.  Pilots  operating  under  IFR  into  US  civil  airports  will  request  5  miles  separation under  radar  control  or  2  minutes  non-radar  control  from  heavy  jets  (departure  and  arrival).  (T-2) Section 6H—Postflight 6.52.  Impoundment.  If  an  aircraft  is  involved  in  a  serious  incident,  the  PIC  should  impound the  aircraft  immediately  and  contact  the  AFSOC  Command  Center  or  controlling  agency  for further instructions. 6.52.1.  Impoundment  is  the  isolation  or  control  of  access  to  an  aircraft  or  equipment  item and applicable historical records so an intensified investigation can be completed. 6.52.2.  If  required,  impound  the  aircraft  IAW  AFI  21-101,  Aircraft  and  Equipment Maintenance Management , Chapter 9.  (T-2) Section 6I—Debriefing AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   63  6.53.  Maintenance.  The PIC and the FE ensure crew members complete the AFTO Form 781.  (T-2) 6.53.1.  Immediately after arrival, the PIC and any crew position documenting a maintenance discrepancy will debrief maintenance personnel on the status of the aircraft and subsystems and discrepancies entered into the AFTO Form 781A document.  At stations where there is no AFSOC maintenance and maintenance support is required, the PIC will ensure a thorough debrief is provided to the controlling CCC prior to entering crew rest.  (T-2) 6.53.2.  Aircrews will complete the AFTO Form  781A as needed.  The PIC will review the aircraft  forms,  determine  those  discrepancies  considered  as  mission  essential  and  may indicate  them  by  entering  ‘ME’  in  block  letters  in  the  lower  left  hand  corner  of  the  AFTO Form  781A  discrepancy  block.    Use  ‘MC’  (mission  contributing)  to  indicate  any discrepancies  that,  if  not  corrected,  would  substantially  affect  mission  accomplishment,  but are not mission essential.  (T2) 6.53.3.  Use  Block  14  (discrepancy)  of  the  AFTO  Form  350,  Repairable  Item  Processing Tag, with an AFTO Form 781 entry to identify and tag any defective item of equipment such as headsets, thermos jugs, etc.  (T-2) 6.53.4.  Ensure  flight  time,  landings,  aircraft  condition,  and  fuel  onloaded/offloaded  during refueling operations is entered in the AFTO Form 781H.  (T-2) 6.53.5.  Enter  “Aircraft  subjected  to  salt  spray”  on  the  AFTO  Form  781A  any  time  the aircraft is flown under 3,000 ft AGL over salt water, excluding takeoffs and landings.  (T-2) 6.53.5.1.  Bird  Bath  procedures.    AC-130W  will  not  use  the  bird  bath  due  to  water intrusion problems with AC-130W Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) Small Laser Turret Assemblies (SLTA).  (T-2) 6.54.  Debriefing.  The  PIC  or  a  designated  representative  will  pass  significant  information  to support  agencies,  such  as  weather,  ATC,  or  base  operations.    Debrief  intelligence  when applicable.    The  PIC  will  conduct  a  crew  debriefing  after  each  mission.    The  debriefing  will include all  applicable crew members so that common problems can be  discussed and resolved.  Crew members may be excused from the debrief at the discretion of the PIC.  (T-2) 6.55.  Aircrew Notification Procedures.  When transiting installations, the PIC will establish a point  of  contact  with  the  local  command  post,  local  base  operations,  or  local  airport  manager.  The  PIC  will  be  notified  immediately  in  case  of  incident  or  emergency  affecting  the  safety  or security of the aircraft.  (T-2) Section 6J—Miscellaneous Procedures 6.56.  Customs, Immigration, and Agriculture Inspections. 6.56.1.  Obtain  Customs,  Agriculture,  and  Public  Health  clearance,  as  required,  prior  to opening any doors, hatches, or windows, other than the crew entrance door, or enplaning and deplaning personnel.  (T-2) 6.56.2.  Proceed  directly  from  the  aircraft  to  Customs,  Immigration,  or  Agricultural inspection for processing when required by the inspector.  (T-2)   64  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 6.56.3.  US  military  aircraft  are  sovereign.    When  cleared  to  over-fly  or  land  in  foreign territory,  it  is  US  policy  to  assert  that  military  aircraft  are  entitled  to  the  privileges  and immunities  which  customarily  are  accorded  warships.    These  privileges  and  immunities include,  in  the  absence  of  stipulations  to  the  contrary,  exemption  from  duties  and  taxation; immunity  from  search,  seizure,  and  inspections  (including  customs  and  safety  inspections); or other exercise of jurisdiction by the host nation over the aircraft, personnel, equipment, or cargo  on  board.    USAF  PICs  will  not  authorize  search,  seizure,  inspection,  or  similar exercises of jurisdiction enumerated above by foreign authorities except by direction of HQ USAF or the American Embassy in the country concerned.  (T-2) 6.56.3.1.  The  PIC  will  not  permit  the  inspection  of  their  aircraft  by  officials  of  any foreign government.  If requested to do so, the PIC and crew will deny access and seek aid  from  the  senior  AFSOC  or  other  USAF  representative,  US  Embassy,  or  consulate within the host nation.  Customs or other officials  will be informed of the above policy and  requested  to  confirm  their  request  through  their  own  government  and  with  US Department of State representatives.  If necessary the aircraft will be sealed by the crew and  the  crew  entered  into  crew  rest  and  departure  intentions  will  be  canceled  until resolution  of  the  matter  by  appropriate  authority.    Inform  command  and  control authorities by the fastest available means should  this situation occur.  When confronted with  a  search  request  by  foreign  authorities,  aircrews  should  consider  the  following procedures:  (T-2) 6.56.3.1.1.  In most cases, search attempts may be stopped by a statement of the PIC to the foreign officials that the aircraft is sovereign and not subject to search without consent of HQ USAF or the chief of mission in the country concerned.  This should be  clearly  conveyed  in  a  polite  manner  so  as  not  to  offend  foreign  authorities  who may honestly, but mistakenly, believe they have authority to search USAF aircraft. 6.56.3.1.2.  If foreign authorities insist on conducting a search, the PIC must negotiate to delay the search until contact is made with HQ USAF/A3OOA or the appropriate embassy.  The PIC should unequivocally state that they have no authority to consent to  the  search  and  that  they  must  relay  the  foreign  request  to  these  agencies  for decision.    The  PIC  should  then  notify  these  agencies  of  the  foreign  request  by  the most  expeditious  means  available.    Thereafter,  PICs  should  follow  instructions provided by the appropriate embassy and HQ USAF. 6.56.3.1.3.  If foreign officials refuse to desist in their search request, the PIC should indicate  that  they  would  prefer  to  fly  the  aircraft  elsewhere  (provided  fuel  and mechanical considerations permit a safe departure) and request permission to do so. 6.56.3.1.4.  If permission is refused and the foreign authorities insist on forcing their way on board  an aircraft, the PIC should state that  they protest the course of  action being pursued and that they intend to notify both the appropriate American Embassy and HQ USAF of the foreign action.  The PIC should then allow the foreign agents on board  the  aircraft,  without  physical  resistance,  and  thereafter  report  the  incident  to HQ USAF and appropriate embassy as soon as possible. 6.56.3.1.5.  In all instances, specific instructions may be briefed because of sensitive cargo  or  equipment.    These  instructions  and  applicable  provisions  of  classified supplements to the foreign clearance guide should be followed where applicable. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   65  6.57.  Border Clearance. 6.57.1.  Normal Operations: 6.57.1.1.  Border Clearance Requirements.  The requirements will be IAW the applicable Foreign  Clearance  Guide  and  AFI  24-203,  Preparation  and  Movement  of  Air  Force Cargo.  (T2) 6.57.1.2.  PIC Responsibility.  Border clearance is the responsibility of the PIC, although many of the duties have been assigned to ground personnel and to the AG.  The PIC will ensure: 6.57.1.2.1.  Crew members and passengers possess current passports and valid visas if required.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.2.  Crew members and passengers have current shot records or certificates of immunization.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.3.  Cargo entry documents are in proper order.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.4.  Departure  or  arrival  to  the  US  is  through  an  air  base  where  border clearance can be obtained.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.5.  Border  clearance  for  aircraft  cargo,  passengers,  crew  and  baggage,  if required,  is  obtained  before  takeoff  to  a  foreign  area,  or  after  arrival  from  a  foreign area.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.6.  En route to the US, the AG has distributed personal customs declarations to  all  passengers  and  crew  members;  has  briefed  passengers  and  crew  members  on customs  regulations  in  accordance  with  Chapter  13  of  this  instruction;  and  has (CF)  7507,  General  Declaration prepared  and  compiled  Customs  Form (Outward/Inward), for the PIC’s signature.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.7.  En route to the US, the base of intended landing is notified of any change in ETA, to ensure border clearance is accomplished as soon as possible after landing.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.8.  A  Permit  to  Proceed  is  obtained  when  the  mission  requires  an  aircraft, which has landed in the US for customs clearance to proceed to another US base to obtain border clearance.  The permit delays customs inspection of cargo, passengers, and  crew  until  arrival  at  the  offload  station,  saving  intermediate  offloading  and reloading normally required for  customs inspection.  The Permit  to  Proceed is  valid only to the airport of next landing, where the border clearance must be completed, or a  new  permit  obtained.    Do  not  make  intermediate  stops  unless  required  by  an emergency situation or directed by AFSOC.  (T-2) 6.57.1.2.9.  When  an  aircraft  lands  for  a  US  border  clearance,  a  US  Customs representative normally meets the aircraft to obtain the required documents.  Do not deplane  passengers  or  crew  members,  except  a  scanner,  unless  necessary  for  safety.  Do  not  unload  until  approved  by  customs  and  agriculture  personnel  or  their designated representatives.  This procedure applies to the initial landing in the US and all  subsequent  landings  until  crew,  passengers,  and  cargo  complete  final  border clearance.  (T-2)   66  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 6.57.2.  Exercise and Contingency Operations: 6.57.2.1.  General.   Certain  missions, which do not  transit normal  ports of entry or exit, require  special  procedures  to  expedite  compliance  with  customs,  public  health, immigration,  and  agricultural  requirements.    A  joint  memorandum  of  understanding establishes procedures and waivers. 6.57.2.2.  Implementation.  Traffic and border clearing agencies implement all or part of the  agreement  as  necessary  for  each  operation.    Inspection  and  clearance  may  be accomplished  at  the  CONUS  onload  or  offload  base  instead  of  the  normal  air-point  of entry, or at the foreign onload or offload base. 6.57.2.3.

The PIC will ensure required spraying is accomplished when required by the Foreign Clearance Guide and certify the spraying on CF 7507, or on forms provided by the country transited.  (T-2) 6.58.2.  Use  insecticide,  Aerosol  D-Phenotrin-2%,  NSN  6840-01-067-6674  (or  equivalent), to spray the aircraft.  Aircraft should never be sprayed with passengers on board.  The only exception is when mandated by the FCG.  (T-2) 6.58.2.1.  Aerosol normally is  dispersed at  a flow rate of 10 seconds per  1,000 cubic ft.  Direct the nozzle toward the ceiling of the compartment or space being sprayed.  Do not spray any plastic surface or allow the spray to wet it.  (T-2) 6.58.2.2.  Spray spaces inaccessible from within the aircraft after completely loading fuel, baggage, cargo, and passengers, including baggage compartments, wheel wells, and other similar  spaces.    (T-2)                CAUTION:    If  the  insecticide  label  directs  disembarkation after use, spray prior to boarding crew or passengers.  Close all doors and hatches for 10 minutes after dispensing  and ventilate for 15 minutes before allowing anyone on board.  (T-2) 6.58.3.  Spray  for  50  seconds  unless  longer  periods  are  specified  for  the  country  being transited.  (T-2) 6.58.4.  When  the  crew  discovers  insect  or  rodent  infestation  of  the  aircraft  while  in-flight, notify the destination C3, base operations, or airport manager of the situation before landing so the proper authorities can meet the aircraft.  (T-2) 6.58.5.  Upon arrival, do not open cargo doors or hatches except to enplane officials required to  inspect  the  aircraft  for  insect  or  rodent  infestation.    Do  not  onload  or  offload  until  the inspection  is  satisfactorily  completed.    This  procedure  may  be  altered  to  satisfy  mission  or local requirements, as arranged by the base air terminal manager.  (T-2) 6.59.  “Due Regard” Procedures.  When a unit commander authorizes a mission to be flown in international  airspace  over  the  high  seas  and  in-flight  operational  requirements  conflict  with International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  rules  and  procedures,  the  PIC  may  make  the decision to proceed using “due regard” procedures, IAW FLIP General Planning and AFI 11202, Vol 3. 6.60.  Hazardous Material Procedures.  The term “hazardous material” as used in conjunction with  airlift  operations  applies  to  the  following  classes  and  types  of  materials  covered  by  Air Force Joint Instruction (AFJI) 11-204, Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous   68  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Materials,  and  includes  any  material  which,  because  of  its  quantity,  properties,  or  packaging, may  endanger  human  life  or  property.    Procedures  in  this  paragraph  apply  whenever  aircraft carry  DoD  Hazard  Class/Division  1.1,  1.2,  or  1.3  explosives,  Department  of  Transportation (DOT) Class A and B poisons, etiological or biological research materials, radioactive materials requiring yellow III labels, and inert devices.  Also included are DoD Hazard Class/Division 1.4 explosives,  oxidizers,  compressed  gases,  flammable  solids  and  liquids,  and  corrosive  liquids listed in AFMAN 24-204. 6.60.1.  Briefing.  Reference AFMAN 24-204.  (T-2) 6.60.2.  Cargo  Documentation.   Do  not  accept  hazardous  materials  unless  proper documentation,  certification,  and  identification  of  cargo  are  provided.    This  includes transportation control number entered correctly on both the cargo manifest and the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods.  (T-2) 6.60.2.1.  Shipper’s  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods  prepared  by  the  shipper  in accordance  with  AFMAN  24-204  and  AF  Form  127,  Traffic  Transfer  Receipt,  will accompany the manifest, if required.  (T-2) 6.60.3.  Flight Planning.  The PIC (unless specifically briefed otherwise): 6.60.3.1.  Enters “Hazardous Cargo” and the mission number in the appropriate section of the  flight  plan.    Use  remarks  section  of  DD  Form  175,  Military  Flight  Plan,  and  other information section of DD Form 1801, DoD International Flight Plan.  (T-2) 6.60.3.2.  Plans the flight to minimize over flying heavily populated or otherwise critical areas.  (T-2) 6.60.3.3.  Prepares  a  departure  message.    (T-2)    The  remarks  section  of  the  departure message should include the following: 6.60.3.3.1.  DoT  class  and  DoD  hazard  class  or  division,  if  applicable,  of hazardous material on board (include net weight of DoT Class A or B poisons and net explosive weight (NEW) of Class A or B explosives). 6.60.3.3.2.  Request  for  special  support;  e.g.,  isolated  parking,  security,  technical escort teams, etc. 6.60.3.3.3.  Inert devices (when applicable). 6.60.3.4.

Avoid flying over metropolitan or otherwise critical areas.  (T-2) 6.60.6.  Before  Landing.    Accomplish  the  following  unless  specifically  prohibited  by  the theater commander or FLIP planning.  (T-2) 6.60.6.1.  Contact  the  base  operations  dispatcher,  control  tower,  approach  control,  or other agency specified in FLIP at least 30 minutes (or as soon as practical) before ETA to announce  that  hazardous  materials  are  on  board  and  to  verify  that  the  appropriate  base support  agencies  have  received  the  departure  message.    If  not,  transmit  the  mission number, ETA, and information listed in Paragraph 6.60.3.3. 6.60.6.2.  If landing at a CONUS civil airport without a tower, give the above information to the nearest FAA flight service station. 6.60.6.3.  Request the information be relayed immediately to base operations or the civil airport manager, crash or fire protection agency, and other support activities. 6.60.7.  Parking: 6.60.7.1.  DoD  requires  aircraft  carrying  DoD  Hazard  Class  or  Division  1.1,  1.2, explosives, DoT Class A poisons, and certain biological agents and munitions be parked in areas isolated from personnel.  The PIC is responsible for ensuring cargo is correctly identified to the tower and ground control.  When aircraft are not directed to an isolated area,  identify  the  cargo  again  to  tower  or  ground  control.    When  identification  is acknowledged, the host is solely responsible for selecting the parking area.  Should host procedures  be  questionable,  submit  trip  reports  or  hazard  reports,  as  appropriate,  to document such occurrences.  (T-2) 6.60.7.2.  The  military  host  is  responsible  for  placarding  aircraft.    For  non-military installations, the briefing to the PIC will include placarding requirements and, if required, placards will be furnished at the onload base.  The shipper must make prior arrangements with the airport manager for shipments of hazardous materials requiring placarding.  The shipper  is  responsible  for  cargo  identification,  fire-fighting  procedures,  and  isolated parking requirements.  (T-2) 6.60.8.  Unscheduled  Landing  Due information to the appropriate air traffic control facility as follows:  (T-2) to  In-flight  Emergency.   Transmit  unclassified 6.60.8.1.  Nature of emergency and intent to land. 6.60.8.2.  Aircraft position and ETA. 6.60.8.3.  Number of personnel and location in aircraft. 6.60.8.4.  Fuel on board. 6.60.8.5.  That  hazardous  materials  are  on  board,  location  of  the  cargo,  and  applicable information listed in Paragraph 6.60. 6.60.9.  After  Unscheduled  Landing.    Contact  the  AFSOC  Command  Center  or  appropriate C2  agency  concerned  by  telephone,  HF  radio,  or  message,  giving  arrival  notice,  hazardous materials’ information, and other pertinent information as required.  (T-2)   70  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Chapter 7 AIRCRAFT SECURITY 7.1.  General.  This  chapter provides  guidance  for aircraft security  on the  ground  and in-flight.  AFSOC AC-130W aircraft are Protection Level "C" resources.  This security priority designation applies  to  operational  aircraft,  wherever  they  are  located,  worldwide.    Some  aircraft  contain equipment  and  documents  that  require  protection  per  DoD  5200.1-R  and  AFI  31-401, Information Security Program Management. 7.2.  Procedures.  The  PIC  is  ultimately  responsible  for  the  security  of  their  aircraft  when located  away  from  US  military  installations.    AFJI  31-102,  Physical  Security,  covers  security arrangements  when  US  Air  Force  aircraft  are  located  on  other  DoD  military  installations.  Arrangements must be  made to  protect  the aircraft during crew rest  status at  non-US  protected locations.    If  US  military  security  forces  are  not  available,  the  US  embassy  assigned  to  that country must be consulted to ensure security arrangements are made.  For missions involving a planning  agency,  the  agency  must  coordinate  with  the  PIC  to  ensure  the  planned  security measures  conform  to  mission  requirements.    The  amount  of  security  required  will  vary, depending on location and ground time.  (T-2) 7.2.1.  For  non-permissive  or  uncertain  environments,  the  agency  requesting  the  mission  is responsible for airfield and runway security.  The crew will work with the agency requesting the mission to  insure security meets  the  requirement  for the mission.  See AFTTP  3-33 for security and planning details for these types of operations.  (T-2) 7.2.2.  For  permissive  environments  the  PIC  will  receive  a  threat  assessment  and  force protection  capability  evaluation  briefing  at  home  station  prior  to  departure  and  receive updates en route, if required.  When landing at a DoD component installation, the instillation commander  is  responsible  to  provide  adequate  security  for  the  aircraft.    The  PIC  will determine  if  security  is  adequate.    Planning  agencies  and  PIC  will  use  Table  7.1  to  help assess  the  risk  to  parked  aircraft  for  planned  overnight  stops  located  at  non-US  military installation overseas and civilian airfields.  (T-2)       Note:  Aircrews do possess the training to  provide  the  appropriate  security  when  present  at  the  aircraft.    For  unscheduled  or emergency landings at non-USAF installations, PIC will assess the aircraft security situation and take the following actions, if force protection capability appears insufficient:  (T-2) 7.2.2.1.  Aircrew  surveillance.    If  the  aircraft  is  not  remaining  overnight,  aircrews  are capable  of  maintaining  appropriate  aircraft  security.    The  PIC  will  direct  armed  crew members  to  remain  with  the  aircraft  and  maintain  surveillance  of  aircraft  entrances  and activities in the aircraft vicinity.  (T-2) 7.2.2.2.  Area Patrol.  Request area patrol coverage from local security forces to include back-up  response  forces.    If  local  authorities  request  payment  for  this  service,  use  AF Form 15, USAF Invoice.  (T-2) 7.2.2.3.  Departure  without  Crew  Rest.    If  local  security  forces  are  unacceptable  or unavailable, the PIC may waive FDP restrictions IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3 and depart as soon as possible for a destination with adequate force protection.  If unable to depart the location  due  to  system  malfunction,  the  aircrew  must  secure  the  aircraft  to  the  best  of their  ability.    In  no  case,  will  the  entire  crew  leave  the  aircraft  unattended.    Crew  rest AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   71  requirements  will  be  subordinate  to  aircraft  security  when  the  airframe  may  be  at  risk.  The  PIC  should  rotate  a  security  detail  among  the  crew  to  provide  for  both  aircraft protection  and  crew  rest  until  relief  is  available.    PIC  will  coordinate  through  home station (T-2) additional acquire channels to security.   7.2.3.  Tailored Security Measures.  Standard physical security measures may be impractical at  times  due  to  mission,  terrain,  climate,  sociopolitical  sensitivities,  or  other  factors.    For example,  some  countries  don't  allow  armed  security  personnel.    On  other  deployments,  the mission  may  rely  on  maintaining  a  low  profile  and  attracting  as  little  attention  as  possible.  At such locations, tailor security measures to meet unique requirements when necessary.  As a minimum lock aircraft entry points and hatches.  If it is not possible to lock aircraft, secure aircraft entry points and hatches in a manner to indicate unauthorized entry, i.e., taping hatch release handles or using seals.  The PIC is the final authority for determining tailored security measures.    Contact  with  US  Embassy  personnel  is  required  at  locations  where  security agreements are not in existence.  (T-2) 7.2.4.  Ground  security  teams.    Ground  security  teams  may  be  considered  to  guard  the aircraft  for  planned  overnight  stops.    Teams  may  travel  in  Mission  Essential  Personnel (MEP) status and are responsible to the PIC at all times.  The PIC will ensure security team members receive a mission briefing, aircraft egress, and passenger briefings, as appropriate.  (T-2)    The  squadron  commander  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  the  need  of  ground security teams for their aircraft and authority may be delegated no lower than the PIC.  (T-3) 7.2.4.1.  Ground  security  teams  will  comply  with  AFMAN  24-204  at  all  times  when carrying weapons, ammo, and equipment onboard the aircraft.  (T-2) 7.2.4.2.  Due  to  the  sensitivity  of  weapons  in  foreign  countries,  ground  security  teams will keep their weapons  inside the aircraft  and out-of-sight of  foreign nationals, even if the FCG allows them to be carried outside the aircraft.  If a destination requires weapons be carried outside the aircraft, the controlling MAJCOM must approve such action prior to deployment.  (T-2) 7.2.5.  Unauthorized  Entry.    If,  in  the  PIC’s  judgment,  the  aircraft  needs  to  be  locked  and sealed as a measure to detect unauthorized entry: 7.2.5.1.  Use the aircraft lock.  (T-2)  Note:  The aircraft should be locked during all off-station missions remaining overnight. 7.2.5.2.  If the aircraft lock is unavailable comply with Paragraph 7.2.3.  Close and seal the  main  crew  entrance  door  using  a  metal  boxcar  seal  or  other  controllable  device  to identify forced entry.  Wipe the immediate area around the seal clean to help investigate forced entry.  If the seals are damaged or have been tampered with, notify the appropriate local authorities, the controlling agency, and inspect the aircraft thoroughly.  (T-2) 7.2.5.3.  Coordinate  with  the  local  base  operations  representative  on  procedures  for servicing the aircraft while the crew is away.  If a padlock is used, the key or combination will  be  left  with  base  operations  or  the  representative  for  servicing  and  maintenance personnel.  (T-2)    Note:  At a Temporary Duty (TDY) location with munitions on board a crew member or maintenance personnel will be at the aircraft at all times or the aircraft   72  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 will  be  locked.      If  the  aircraft  is  left  unattended,  the  PIC  will  ensure  the  appropriate protection is provided by flightline security forces.  (T-2) 7.2.6.  Security  awareness  is  crucial  to  effective  mission  accomplishment.    Aircrews  must always remain vigilant to their surroundings, especially at high threat, low security locations.  During pre-flight activities, aircrews will inspect accessible areas, to include aircraft wheel-wells,  air-conditioning  compartments,  and  cargo  compartment  for  unauthorized  packages, personnel, or other unfamiliar devices.  Report any suspicious items to host security forces.  Aircrews  will  maintain  a  heightened  security  posture  throughout  all  pre-takeoff  activities.  (T-2) 7.3.  Aircraft  Security  Risk  Assessment  Matrix.  Planning agencies and the PIC will use this matrix to help assess the risk to parked aircraft in a permissive environment.  This matrix will be used for planned overnight stops at non-US military installations overseas and civilian airfields.  A cumulative score of less than 55 implies that normal unmanned aircraft security measures are adequate.  A score of 55 to 90 implies moderate security risk.  (T-2)  Commander may consider additional  security  measures.    If  the  cumulative  score  is  greater  than  90,  commanders  should consider  deploying  or  contracting  security  personnel.    The  squadron  commander  or  mission commander  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  aircraft  security  issues.    Authority  may  be delegated  no  lower  than  the  PIC.    (T-3)          Exception:    During  unscheduled  or  emergency landings the PIC is the final approval authority for aircraft security.  The PIC should contact the US  Embassy  or  United  States  Defense  Attaché  Office  for  security  assistance.            Note:  Normally,  additional  security  for  the  aircraft  is  not  required  at  military  installation  within  a NATO country or US civilian airfields approved by the FAA/TAS. Table 7.1.

If a security response team and security patrol is not present, commanders should consider deploying or contracting security personnel. 7.4.  Protective  Standards  for  Aircraft  Carrying  Distinguished  Visitors  (DV).  This paragraph applies specifically to aircraft transporting DV Code 4 or above.  PICs are responsible for aircraft security at en route stops.  (T-2) 7.4.1.  DoD Installations.  Notify the base security forces of estimated arrival and departure times.    Request  continuous  security  surveillance  during  the  entire  ground  time.    If  the installation is unable to comply, arrange for the best protection available.  (T-2) 7.4.2.  Non-DoD  Installations.    Contact  the  airport  manager  or  installation  commander  to arrange for force protection.  If available security is inadequate, purchase additional security using AF Form 15, US Air Force Invoice.  (T-2) 7.5.  Arming of Crew Members.  When directed, at least one crew member each from the flight deck and cargo compartment will carry weapons.  (T-2) 7.5.1.  Issue.  Before departing home station, authorized crew members will obtain weapons, ammunition,  lock,  and  key.    Crew  members  must  present  a  current  AF  Form  523,  USAF   74  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Authorization to Bear Firearms, to be issued a weapon.   Crew members will be reissued the same weapon until the mission terminates at home station.  If an armed crew member must leave the crew en route, transfer the weapon to  another authorized crew member, using AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt.  (T-2) 7.5.2.  Loading  and  Transfer  of  Weapons.    Load  and  unload  weapons  at  approved  clearing barrels/facilities if available.  To transfer a loaded weapon to another crew member, place the weapon on a flat surface.  Do not use a hand-to-hand transfer.  (T-2) 7.5.3.  Wearing of Weapons.  Wear weapons in a holster, concealed at all times to protect the identity of armed crew members.  Do not wear weapons off the flightline, except to and from the  C3,  armories,  and  other  facilities  associated  with  aircrew  activities  such  as  base operations,  fleet  service,  cargo  or  passenger  terminals,  flightline  cafeterias,  snack  bars,  etc.  (T-2) 7.5.4.  Weapons Storage.  Crew members will be armed before beginning preflight or onload duties.  When no passengers are on board and after a satisfactory stowaway check, weapons may be stored in the gun box during flight.  If no gun box is available retain weapon for the duration  of  the  flight.    Crew  members  will  rearm  before  landing.    Weapons  need  not  be unloaded before being placed in the gun box.  (T-2) 7.5.5.  Crew  Rest.    During  crew  rest,  store  weapons  in  the  most  secure  facility  available, normally  the  base  armory.    If  a  weapons  storage  facility  is  unavailable  or  the  country prohibits or restricts the entry of weapons, secure firearms and ammunition in the gun box.  (T-2) 7.5.5.1.  Aircraft  without  a  Gun  Box.    If  an  aircraft  without  a  gun  box  must  remain overnight at a location where a government-owned storage facility is unavailable, use the nearest  acceptable  facility.    Acceptable  storage  facilities  are  US  or  Allied  military services  armories,  US  National  Guard  and  Reserve  armories,  and  US  civil  law enforcement  armories.    If  none  of  these  are  available,  or  the  PIC  believes  weapons security may be compromised, crew members may secure their weapons in their quarters, one  crew  member  will  remain  with  the  weapons  at  all  times.    In  this  case,  turn  the ammunition over to the PIC.  (T-2) 7.6.  General  Anti-Hijacking Guidance.  Aircrews must make every reasonable effort to resist an  aircraft  hijacking  attempt,  resistance  may  vary  from  dissuasion,  to  direct  physical confrontation,  including  the  use  of  deadly  force.    Due  to  the  sensitive  nature  of  anti-hijacking procedures,  crew  members  should  reference  AFI  13-207,  Preventing  and  Resisting  Aircraft Piracy (for official use only,) and the FIH for specific guidance.  Aircrews will not release any information  concerning  those  procedures  or  hijacking  attempts.    Anti-hijacking  is  a  crew  duty performed exclusively by aircrew personnel.  The hijacking of an AFSOC aircraft could create a serious international incident and jeopardize the safety of passengers and property.  An aircraft is most vulnerable when the crew is on board and the aircraft is ready for flight.  Hijackers cannot be  dealt  with  as  ordinary  criminals.    Some  are  mentally  disturbed,  emotionally  unstable individuals for whom the threat of death is not a deterrent, but a stimulus to crime.  Delay tactics have been most successful in saving lives and property.  Detection of potential hijackers before they board the aircraft is the best solution to the problem.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   75  7.6.1.  Anti-hijacking  inspections  of  space-required  passengers  may  be  conducted  at  the aircraft  by  the  aircrew.    Passengers  (including  MEP)  will  not  carry  weapons  and/or ammunition  on  their  person  or  in  hand-carried  baggage  on  board  an  aircraft.    (T-2)           Exception:    Special  agents/guards  of  the  Secret  Service  or  State  Department,  and  other individuals  specifically  authorized  to  carry  weapons  with  coordination  of  the  PIC.    In  all cases the crew will be aware of location of weapons and ammunition.  (T-2) 7.6.1.1.  If individuals must  clear their weapons  before boarding the aircraft, and access to clearing barrel/facilities is limited, as a minimum, direct them to: 7.6.1.1.1.  Move  to  a  safe,  clear  area  at  least  50  ft  from  any  aircraft,  equipment,  or personnel before un-holstering/un-slinging their weapons. 7.6.1.1.2.  Clear their weapons in accordance with standard safety procedures. 7.6.1.2.  Deadhead  crew  members  will  not  retain  custody  of  ammunition  on  an  aircraft but will turn it in to the troop commander or PIC.  (T-2)          Exception:  During combat operations, personnel may carry unloaded weapons and ammunition on board the aircraft.  When  the  tactical  situation  dictates,  personnel  who  might  engage  an  enemy  force immediately  upon  deplaning  at  the  objective  may  carry  loaded  weapons  aboard  the aircraft  at  the  discretion  of  the  troop  commander/team  leader,  and  with  the  PIC’s concurrence.  Weapons will not be breached until clear of the aircraft.  (T-2) 7.7.  Specific  Anti-Hijacking  Guidance.  It  is  imperative  that  all  crew  members  are  familiar with the ground and in-flight resistance actions, covert communications, and forced penetration of unfriendly airspace procedures in AFI 13-207 and the FIH.  In the event of a hijacking, crew members  must  act  immediately  and  resourcefully,  without  instruction,  in  order  to  counter  the attacker successfully.

The following guidance applies to all engine(s) out training on AFSOC C-130 aircraft: 9.4.3.1.  Instructor pilots should review TO 1C-130H -1-1, Performance Data, Chapter 3 and  appropriate  TO  1C-130(A)W-1  Chapter  3  information  with  their  trainee(s)  before flight.    A  complete  understanding  of  minimum  control  speeds  and  the  factors  affecting those speeds are critical to performing simulated engine(s) out training successfully. 9.4.3.2.  Normally, turns should be planned to be in the direction of the good engines.   84  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 9.4.3.3.  Turns into simulated failed engines should be minimized.  Turns into simulated failed engines are permissible but  require  a higher degree of pilot  skill  than with  actual failed  engines  and  must  be  smooth  and  coordinated.            WARNING:    Improper application  of  rudder  or  power  can  lead  to  an  immediate  out-of-control  situation  from which recovery might not be possible. 9.4.4.  Simulated  EPs  are  prohibited  with  passengers  on  board.    (T-2)            Exception:  Simulated EPs required for the purposes of a functional check flight are authorized.

Conduct  simulated  emergency  flight  procedures  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3  Chapter  5 and  this  instruction.    Use  a  realistic  approach  and  do  not  compound  emergencies.    Limit simulated emergencies to non-critical phases of flight when possible.  Notify the controlling agency if a nonstandard traffic pattern or pattern requiring special sequencing is anticipated.  (T-2) 9.4.6.  During  live-fire  operations,  limit  simulated  emergency  procedures  to  strike-specific scenarios  (i.e.,  sensor  malfunctions,  gun  malfunctions,  etc.)  to  preclude  channelizing attention away from the life-fire.  (T-2) 9.4.7.  Training maneuver restrictions for specific flight maneuvers and missions are listed in Paragraph 9.8. 9.5.  Touch-and-Go Landings.

(T-2)   88  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Chapter 11 NAVIGATOR PROCEDURES 11.1.  General.  In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  the  flight  manual,  other  applicable  technical orders,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may  assign  other  duties  to  the  NAV,  as  necessary.  All AC130W  flight  operations  requiring  a  NAV  will  use  the  navigation  forms  found  in Paragraph 11.1.1 of this instruction.  (T-2) 11.1.1.  Forms.    This  volume  contains  instructions  for  completion  of  AF  Forms  4116  and 4139.  Computer Flight Plans  (CFP) may be used in lieu of the AF Form 70,  Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log and the flight plan portion of the AF Form 4116. 11.1.2.  Definitions.  Category II Routes are defined as any route on which the position of the aircraft can be accurately determined by the overhead crossing of a radio aid (Non directional beacon  (NDB),  VHF  Omnidirectional  Radio  (VOR),  Tactical  Air  Navigation  (TACAN))  at least  once  each  hour  with  positive  course  guidance  between  such  radio  aids.    Category  I Routes are defined as any route that does not meet the requirements of a Category  II route, including lowlevel and overwater routes. 11.2.  General Mission Planning Procedures. 11.2.1.  Flight  Plans.    Regardless  of  whether  a  flight  plan  is  prepared  by  the  aircrew  or  is furnished  by  another  agency,  the  PIC  and  NAV  will  verify  routes  and  altitudes  to  ensure proper  terrain  clearance.    On  overseas  flights,  verify  the  flight  planned  routing  against  the diplomatic  clearance,  if  applicable.    Ensure  all  required  fuel  computations  are  accurate  and complete, and confirm the ramp fuel load is compatible with mission requirements.  (T-2) 11.2.2.  Category  I  Routes.    Accomplish  flight  planning  using  the  AF  Form  4116,  or  a Computer Flight Plan (CFP).  Compute the required fuel load using the AF Form 4116 or AF Form 4139.  (T-2) 11.2.3.  Category  II  Routes.    Use  the  AF  Form  70,  AF  Form  4116,  or  a  CFP.    Compute required fuel  using the  AF  Form  4116, or AF  Form  4139.  Not required in  the local  flying area.  For local training sorties, a personal log may be used.  (T-2) 11.2.4.  Provide a copy of the flight plan to the pilot.  (T-2) 11.2.5.  Fuel Planning.  Required on all missions.  Use AF Form 4116 or AF Form 4139.  For tactical  missions  and  local  training  sorties,  a  personal  log  may  be  used.    Fuel  requirements and  calculations  will  be  accomplished  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3  AFSOC  Sup  1,  this instruction,  and  appropriate  performance  TO.    Accomplish  fuel-planning  IAW  TO 1C130H11 and TO 1C130(A)W1.  CFP en route fuel may be used for fuel analysis in lieu of en route fuel derived from the performance TO.  (T-2) 11.2.6.  NAVs will compute an abort point along the AAR track where conditions will allow for a safe return to  a refueling base with  appropriate fuel  reserves  IAW AFI 11-202,  Vol 3 and this instruction.  This will be used in the event AAR is unable to be completed.  Label this point on the NAV's chart.  (T-2) 11.2.7.  Signature  Block.    If  using  AF  Form  4116,  or  equivalent  CFP,  sign  the  form  after completing  the  flight  plan  portion  (or  verifying  the  CFP)  and  completing  the  time  and  fuel AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   89  analysis, wind factor, and Equal  Time Point (ETP) data.   The Navigator  Signature block is found in Section II of the AF Form 4116.  (T-2) 11.3.  Computer Flight Planning.  The aircrew is always responsible for accuracy of data used in-flight.  All computer generated flight plans will be verified for correctness prior to each flight.  Use  only  AFSOC  approved  computer  flight  planning  software.    Untested  or  Beta  versions  of developing software will not be used for actual mission planning.  (T-2) 11.3.1.  Creating Flight Logs.  CFPs from approved flight planning software may be used in lieu of manual flight log (AF Form 4116) so long as the CFP provides the same information found on the manual flight log.  (T-2) 11.3.2.  Electronic Data Transfer.  If the flight planning computer transfers a flight plan to the aircraft  electronically,  it  must  be  an  AFSOC  approved  system.    Aircrews  will  not  use unapproved versions of any system to load an aircraft navigation computer.  (T-2) 11.3.3.  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  CFPs.    AMC  CFPs  may  be  available  for  missions that meet CFP support criteria and are within the capability of the system.  Obtain the CFP through  the  command  post,  base  weather  facility,  or  base  operations  dispatcher.    Review AMC provided CFP to ensure accuracy for AC-130 missions.  (T-2) 11.3.4.  Computer Fuel Plans.  Computer aided flight-planning systems (that meet the criteria in Paragraph 11.3.1) produce flight plans and fuel calculations for C-130 and other aircraft.  Computer Flight Plans may be used in place of the AF Form 4116.  However, add alternate, identified  extra,  and  reserve  fuel  in  addition  to  the  calculation.    The  printed  format  is  user configurable and may be tailored to local needs.  (T-2) 11.4.  ETP Calculations. 11.4.1.  Use  Section  II  (Fuel/ETP  Planning),  ETP  Calculation  portion,  of  AF  Form  4116.  Wind  Factor  and  ETP  Data  Computations  are  required  on  Category  I  routes  or  Category  I portions of routes when the total time between the last suitable airfield (LSAF) and the First Suitable Airfield (FSAF) is  5 hours or more.  Suitable airfields are those  within 100 nm  of flight  planned  course  centerline  meeting  weather,  fuel,  and  AFSOC  C-130  runway requirements.  (T-2) 11.4.1.1.  For  air-to-air  refueling  missions,  make  a  separate  computation  for  each  fuel analysis required.  The ETP should drive the location of your planned AAR track.  Plan to have sufficient fuel at each End-Air-Refueling (EAR) point to proceed to an abort base if  the  tanker  does  not  show  or  if  otherwise  unable  to  complete  refueling.    Use  a  point abeam the AAR abort base as the LSAF or FSAF for wind factor computations.  (T-2) 11.4.1.2.  Wind factor and ETP computations are not required for round robin or search missions. 11.4.2.  Wind  Factor  Data.    For  wind  factor  data,  LSAF  means  level-off,  abeam  or  over LSAF,  or  closest  planned  checkpoint  or  radio  aid  within  100  nm  of  LSAF.    FSAF  means abeam  or  over  FSAF,  closest  planned  checkpoint  or  radio  aid  within  100  nm  of  FSAF, descent point, or destination.  Use any of the options in the ETP options graph, Figure 11.1.  Specify  the  option  used  in  the  ETP  computations  section  of  the  AF  Form  4116.    Record computations in the ETP computations section.  (T-2) 11.4.2.1.  Total.  Compute the average GS between LSAF and FSAF.  (T-2)   90  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 11.4.2.2.  1st  Half.  Compute the average GS  between  LSAF and approximate midpoint between  LSAF  and  the  FSAF.    Subtract  flight-planned  average  True  Airspeed  (TAS) from the computed average GS to obtain the 1st half wind factor.  (T-2) 11.4.2.3.  2nd Half.  Compute the average GS between the approximate midpoint and the FSAF.  Subtract flight planned TAS from the computed average GS to obtain the 2nd half wind factor.  (T-2) 11.4.3.  ETP Data. 11.4.3.1.  DISTANCE  (LSAF  TO  FSAF).    Enter  the  total  distance  (regardless  of  level off)  from  or  abeam  the  LSAF  along  course  from  departure  to  or  abeam  the  FSAF  long course toward destination.  (T-2) 11.4.3.2.  (T)  MIN.  The flight time from the ETP to the FSAF or return to the LSAF. 11.4.3.3.  TOTAL  TIME  TO  FSAF  -  T  =  TIME  TO  ETP.    Subtract  the  time,  (T)  MIN, from  the  total  flight  plan  time  to  the  FSAF.    TIME  TO  ETP  is  the  total  time  from departure to the ETP (departure and takeoff may not necessarily be the same).  Compute and record ETA to ETP by adding TIME TO ETP to departure time.

Maintain a plotting chart showing flight progress on all Category I routes and tactical missions.  The following information will be shown on the chart:  (T-2) 11.7.1.1.  NAV’s  name  and  coordinated  universal  date  in  the  vicinity  of  departure  or coast  out  point.    Chart  number,  and  chart  edition  will  be  annotated  on  the  back  of  all stripped  charts.    Check  the  Chart  Updating  Manual  (CHUM)  on  all  charts  (Global Navigation  Chart  (GNC),  Jet  Navigation  Chart  (JNC),  etc.).    CHUM  information  is  not required on high-level charts.  (T-2) 11.7.1.2.  The flight plan centerlines and portions of ADIZ and FIR boundaries pertinent to  the  route.    Label  reporting  points  with  proper  names  or  geographical  coordinates.  Place the applicable portion of the “No Fly” line on all charts used for missions flown in the vicinity of unfriendly territory or other no-fly areas.  Prominently mark warning and restricted  areas  within  25  nm  of  planned  course  and  3,000  ft  of  planned  altitude  on  the chart (not required if a FLIP en route chart with this information is immediately available and  used).    Annotate  airfields  along  the  planned  route  which  could  serve  as  possible emergency  landing  areas.    Consider  the  following  factors  when  selecting  emergency airfields:    type  aircraft,  weather  conditions,  runway  length,  runway  weight-bearing capacity, runway lighting, radio  navigational  aids, and proximity to  planned flight  path.  (T-2) 11.7.1.3.  Fixes or position plots and clearly designate time of each fix or position.  Fixes or  positions  may  be  numbered  and  the  corresponding  numbers  entered  in  the  position column of the log instead of the geographical coordinates or descriptive position.  (T-2) 11.7.1.4.  Annotate the calculated ETP along the route if ETP is required for the mission.  (T-2) 11.7.1.5.  Annotate AAR abort point as described in Paragraph 11.2 if applicable for the mission.  (T-2) 11.7.2.  In the interest of conservation, re-use flight charts for high level missions whenever this would not affect plotting accuracy of fixes or position determination.  (T-2) 11.7.3.  Approved  laptop  computers  running  a  current  version  of  Falcon  View  with appropriate chart coverage and chart scale may be used for tactical missions instead of paper charts.  Required paper charts must be available should Falcon View not be accessible.  (T-2) 11.8.  In-Flight Procedures. 11.8.1.  Communications  &  Radios.    Monitor  the  primary  command  radio  unless  otherwise directed by the PIC.  Record ATC clearances and monitor the read back.  This  includes all ATC  instructions  during  departure,  en  route,  and  approach.    This  procedure  is  not  required when  ATC  instructions  require  immediate  execution  by  the  pilot,  or  when  such  action interferes with the timely performance of other time-sensitive NAV duties.  (T-2) 11.8.2.  Departure  and  Approach  Monitoring.    Immediately  after  takeoff,  cross-check available  flight  instruments  with  the  airborne  radar  to  ensure  the  aircraft  remains  clear  of terrain  and  obstructions.    During  departure  and  arrival  in  IMC  with  airborne  radar inoperative,  use  all  available  navigational  aids  to  accurately  position  the  aircraft.    On  all departures and arrivals, have the appropriate approach plate open to monitor course, timing,   102  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 and altitude.  Backup the pilots and assist as necessary.  Report any deviations immediately.  Assist in clearing for other aircraft when possible.  Confine activities to these critical duties during all departures and arrivals.  (T-2) 11.8.2.1.  To  monitor  aircraft  on  approaches  and  departures,  the  NAV  will  use  a  terrain chart  in  ONC,  TPC,  or  JOG  scale  with  current  CHUM  depicting  all  terrain  and obstructions within 25 nm of the airfield terminal area.  (T-2) 11.8.3.  Flight  Following.    The  NAV  will  flight  follow  on  all  missions  using  a  suitable plotting  chart  (JNC,  JNCA,  or  GNC).    This  is  not  required  in  the  local  flying  area  for Category II routes, pilot proficiency sorties, or tactical missions.  (T-2) 11.8.4.  Heading Deviation Checks.  Heading deviation checks are not required on Category II routes or tactical missions.  On Category I routes or route segments of 3 hours or longer, compute heading deviation for each compass system as soon as practical after initial level-off or  coast-out.    Record  deviations  for  all  compass  systems.    Use  procedures  in  Paragraph 11.13.  (T2) 11.8.4.1.  On  aircraft  with  reliable  single  INS  or  SCNS  with  a  reliable  INS,  accomplish an initial heading deviation check to validate the INS heading.  This can be accomplished by  comparing  the  airfield  diagram  runway  heading  found  in  the  approach  plate  and applying magnetic variation.  (T-2) 11.8.4.2.  A deviation check is not required on flights transiting Category I routes of less than 3 hours if:  the aircraft is equipped with two or more operable heading systems (the standby  compass  is  not  considered  a  system  for  this  requirement)  and  the  difference between systems does not exceed 2 degrees. 11.8.5.  TAS  Checks.    TAS  checks  are  not  required  on  Category  II  routes  or  tactical missions.    Compute  TAS  check  on  all  Category  I  routes  of  3  hours  or  longer  using procedures  in  Paragraph  11.14.    Compute  within  1  hour  after  reaching  the  initial  cruise altitude.    Aircraft  without  an  operable  or  reliable  air  data  computer  or  transducer  will accomplish a TAS check after every change in altitude greater than 4,000 ft in addition to the initial TAS check.  (T-2) 11.8.6.  In-flight  Fuel  Management.  Required  for each flight  over  a Category  I  route when the flight time between LSAF and FSAF airfields is 4 hours or more.  Record first entry upon level-off.  Time between level-off entry and next entry may be up to 1 hour and 30 minutes, and no more than 1 hour each entry thereafter.  Use the in-flight fuel management sections of the AF Form 4116 or AF Form 4139 when air-to-air refueling is performed.  The NAV may terminate these procedures one hour from destination, when the Category I route segment is completed, or at the discretion of the PIC.  See Paragraphs 11.11 and 11.12 for procedures.  (T-2) 11.8.6.1.  Tactical  and local  training missions.  NAVs will calculate a “Bingo” fuel  that ensures  the  crew  will  have  enough  fuel  to  leave  the  operating  area  and  return  to  the recovery  airfield  with  the  appropriate  fuel  reserves.    If  AAR  is  planned,  NAVs  will calculate  a  fuel  requirement  that  ensures  the  crew  will  have  enough  fuel  to  leave  the operating  area,  travel  to  and  transit  the  planned  AAR  track,  and  return  to  the recovery/divert  base  with  appropriate  fuel  reserves  in  the  event  AAR  is  unable  to  be completed.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   103  11.8.7.  Fix  Interval.    NAVs  will  maintain  a  flight  log  on  Category  I  routes  of  3  hours  or longer.    Time  between  recorded  fixes/positions  will  not  exceed  1  hour.    NAVs  will periodically  record  spot  readings  between  recorded  fixes/position  that  include  time  of reading,  aircraft  heading,  drift  angle,  GS,  wind  data,  and  TAS.    Use  procedures  in Paragraph 11.10.  Perform associated fix/position plotting on flight chart IAW Paragraph 11.7.1.3.  (T-2) 11.8.8.  ETP  Calculations.    Recompute  the  ETP  when  the  actual  arrival  over  any  reporting point prior to the ETP exceeds 15 minutes ahead or behind time when the change was caused by erroneous wind information.  If the change was caused by factors other than a change in the  wind  (slower  TAS  flown  than  planned,  weather  deviation,  etc.),  simply  compute  a  new ETA to the ETP, as the ETP itself will not have changed.  Follow procedures in Paragraph 11.4.  (T-2) 11.8.9.  Immediately  report  malfunctions  or  loss  of  navigational  capability  which  will degrade course centerline accuracy to the air traffic control center.  (T-2) 11.9.  Laptop  Computers.  Laptop  computers  running  Falcon  View  moving  map  software  and connected to a handheld GPS may be used to provide in-flight situational awareness (SA).  (T-2) 11.9.1.  Laptop computers and handheld GPS will be used IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 11.9.2.  NAVs will carry a handheld GPS unit on all Category I route sorties.  (T-2) 11.9.3.  Laptop computers with handheld GPS Falcon View moving map displays will not be used as the primary source of navigation.  (T-2) 11.10.  Flight  Records.  Use  AF  Form  4116,  Section  I,  Flight  Data,  and  Section  IX,  In-Flight Data.  Record enough detail to reconstruct the mission.  Units may publish their standards for log procedures in the unit supplement.  This form will consist of planning and in-flight progress data.  It  will  be  completed  in  sufficient  detail  to  fully  evaluate  or  reconstruct  the  flight.    See Figure 11.6 and Figure 11.7 for examples for completed AF Form 4116 Sections I and IX.  (T2) 11.10.1.  Flight Data.  Section I of AF Form 4116 is used to record data for the planned route.

Between recorded fixes/positions, periodically record spot readings at regular intervals  to  allow  for  calculating  a  DR  plot  in  the  event  of  a  navigation  system  failure.  Spot  readings  will  include  time  of  reading,  aircraft  heading,  drift  angle,  GS,  wind  data, and TAS.  (T2) 11.10.2.5.  As  soon  as  practical  prior  to  coast-in,  NAVs  will  verify  aircraft  position  by either navigation aid fix or radar fix.  (T-2) 11.10.2.6.  In the  event  of a navigation system failure (INS  or GPS) full log procedures will be implemented.  Beginning at the last plotted position, compute a DR plot up to the present  position.    Plot  a  fix/position  at  a  minimum  of  once  per  hour.    A  DR  plot associated with the fix/position will be plotted on the chart prior to plotting the position.  If  the  navigation  system  failure  is  resolved,  the  NAV  may  resume  log  procedures  as outlined in Paragraph 11.10.2.  (T2) 11.10.2.7.  Course Deviations.  If deviating from planned course for weather or directed by ATC, at a minimum, record the aircraft position and spot data when initially deviating from  course.    Unless  other  action  is  required,  record  this  information  again  at  the approximate  farthest  point  away  from  course  during  deviation  prior  to  returning  to course.  (T-2) 11.10.2.8.  In  Section  IX,  In-flight  Data  of  the  AF  Form  4116,  deviations  may  be recorded as an altered heading line (documented as “A/H”).  If unable to maintain log due to weather avoidance, the NAV may write “WEATHER DEVIATIONS” on the line after the previous recorded fix/position data line.  Once clear of weather and heading back to planned course or on course, resume AF Form 4116 entries as required.  (T-2) 11.10.2.9.  Clearance/Remarks.  Enter ATC clearances as discussed in Paragraph 11.8.1.  When  practical,  record  assigned  ATC  frequencies  on  departure  and  approach  in  this section.  Use this section to record other pertinent flight information as required.  (T-2) 11.10.2.10.  RADAR/NAVAID Data.  Use Section VIII of the AF Form 4116.  Use this section  to  record  actual  and  corrected  readings  (if  applicable).    Compare  Doppler,  INS,   106  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 SCNS, and GPS positions (latitude and longitude, or distance-to-go and cross track) for each position fix.  At minimum, record the integrated navigation solution.  If a navigation solution  is  updated,  record  its  incorrect  position  and  show  that  it  was  updated  (in  the remarks section).  Fix data substantiated by ICAO identifier or coordinates in the position block on the actual side of the AF Form 4116 need not be duplicated in this section.  See Figure 11.5 for an example of this section.  (T-2) Figure 11.5.  AF Form 4116 -  & VIII, Fix Positions & NAVAID Data.  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   107  Figure 11.6.

Use Section VII of the AF Form 4116.  In-flight fuel management may be accomplished using the actual in-flight engine burn rates.  Using  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   109  the actual  in-flight  burn  rate method will produce an acceptable error, in that projected  current four engine burn rates will lower as gross weight decreases and power is reduced to maintain a constant TAS.  Block entries are as follows: 11.11.1.  ETA DESTINATION.  Revised ETA at destination/EAR. 11.11.1.1.  NAVs may use flight plan generated by MCs to update ETAs.  Also, laptops with current version of PFPS may be used to update ETAs.  NAVs should update paper log in the event either of these options are unavailable. 11.11.2.  TIME.    Record  the  departure  time,  level  off  time,  and  subsequent  reading  times.  Time intervals between readings will be done IAW Paragraph 11.8.6.  Typically, column 1 will be the takeoff entry and column 2 will be the level-off entry. 11.11.3.  TERM FUEL FLOW.  Terminal Fuel Flow. 11.11.4.  FUEL FLOW.  Fuel burn rate at time of reading. 11.11.5.  AVG FUEL FLOW.  Calculate by adding TERM FUEL FLOW and FUEL FLOW and dividing the sum by 2. 11.11.6.  FUEL REMAINING.  Fuel quantity at time of reading. 11.11.7.  MIN  DIV/REQ  OVHD.    Required  fuel  overhead  (item  13  of  the  AF  Form  4116 Fuel Plan). 11.11.8.  DIFFERENCE.  Subtract MIN DIV/REQ OVHD from FUEL REMAINING. 11.11.9.  FUEL  ETE.    This  is  the  DIFFERENCE  converted  to  time.    Calculate  by  dividing DIFFERENCE by AVG FUEL FLOW. 11.11.9.1.  The NAV may choose to calculate FUEL ETE by dividing DIFFERENCE by FUEL FLOW (current burn rate) instead of using AVG FUEL FLOW.  This will produce a more conservative FUEL ETE. 11.11.10.  ETE  DESTINATION.    Estimated  Time  En  route  to  destination.    Subtract  TIME from ETA DESTINATION. 11.11.11.  EXTRA  TIME.    Subtract  ETE  DESTINATION  from  FUEL  ETE.    Report  this value to the pilot.  If this is a negative value, check the computation and values for errors.  If they are correct, evaluate destination options.   110  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Figure 11.8.  Example AF Form 4116 - Section VII, In-Flight Fuel Management.  11.12.  AF  Form  4139  In-Flight  Fuel  Management.  Use  the  reverse  side  of  AF  Form  4139, Special  Operations  C-130  Air  Refueling  In-flight  Management,  for  manual  in-flight  fuel management  on  missions  incorporating  one  or  two  air-to-air  refuelings.    Using  the  actual  in-flight burn rate method will produce acceptable error in that projected current four engine burn rates will lower as gross weight decreases and power is reduced to maintain a constant TAS.  The TAKEOFF TO EAR #1 and TAKEOFF TO AAR #1 ABORT BASE sections are applicable to both  single and double air refueling missions, while the EAR #1 TO EAR #2 and EAR #1 TO AR #2 ABORT BASE sections only apply to missions requiring two air-to-air refuelings.  For all air-to-air refueling missions, use the AF Form 4116 Fuel Management section after completing the last air-to-air refueling.  The GROSS WEIGHT and PAGE # blocks  are not  required.   The NAV may use one of these blocks to record current fuel flow.  All other entries on the form are self-explanatory except for the following:  (T-2) 11.12.1.  From takeoff to End AAR #1 simultaneously work two en route fuel management solutions,  Takeoff  to  EAR  #1  to  ensure  proper  en  route  fuel  management  to  continue  the mission, and Takeoff to AAR #1 Abort Base to ensure sufficient fuel in the event of a missed AAR.  (T-2) 11.12.2.  From  End  AAR  #1  to  End  AAR  #2  simultaneously  work  two  en  route  fuel management solutions, End AAR #1 to EAR #2 to ensure proper en route fuel management, and EAR #1 to AAR #2 Abort Base to ensure sufficient fuel in the event of a missed AAR for refueling number 2.  These two sections are only applicable to missions requiring two air refuelings.  (T-2) 11.12.3.  Use the AF Form 4116 fuel management section for EAR to destination using item 49 for the O/H Fuel entry.  (T-2) 11.12.4.  TAKEOFF TO EAR #1 section. 11.12.4.1.  EAR #1 FUEL, No Onload (47 / 7).

The  purpose  of  the  TAS  check  is  to  ensure  the  air  data  computer (ADC) is computing a proper calibrated airspeed/TAS and temperature.  Use AF Form 4116,   114  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Section IV.  Heat of Compression and Standard Temperature tables are included on the form.  Block entries are as follows:  (T-2) 11.14.1.1.  TIME.  Time of reading.  Aircraft should be at a stable cruise airspeed. 11.14.1.2.  ALT.  Pressure Altitude at time of reading.  Set 29.92 in altimeter (for reading only). 11.14.1.3.  IOAT.    Indicated  outside  air  temperature.    Apply  Heat  of  Compression numbers to get Total Outside Air Temperature (TOAT).  Record TOAT in this block next to IOAT.  (T-2) 11.14.1.4.  IAS,  CAS,  EAS,  TAS.    Use  the  ICE-T  method  in  AFPAM  11-216,  Air Navigation,      to  convert  indicated  airspeed  (IAS)  to  TAS.    Use  the  appropriate  flight performance  manual  for  airspeed  corrections.    On  aircraft  with  TAS  displays  from operable  air  data  computers/transducers  (ADCs/ADTs),  enter  only  the  displayed  TAS value.  Where two values are displayed from different ADCs/ADTs, enter the average of the two values.  (T-2) 11.14.1.5.  ITAS.  Indicated TAS from ADC.

Example AF Form 4116 -  Section (TAS Check).  11.15.  SCA Construction.  Use the most current sources for topological, point obstruction, and airfield information.  Consider using existing airfield NAVAIDS to increase the reliability of the approach.  (T-2) 11.15.1.  Obstacle Clearance.  The location of terrain and obstructions will dictate the glide slope and altitude profile used.  Draw the horizontal obstacle clearance template, depicted in Figure 11.12, on a 1:250,000 or larger scale chart, if available.  The template begins 0.3 nm either  side  of  runway  centerline  at  the  touchdown  point,  extending  outward  to  1  nm  either side of centerline at 3 nm from the touchdown point.  The template will encompass all terrain 1 nm either side of centerline from the planned descent point extending to 1 nm beyond the planned descent point (For example, a 3.2 nm planned descent point requires a 4.2 nm long template).  If the planned descent point is less than 2 nm from the touchdown zone, then the standard 3 nm template will not require extension.  Refer to  Figure 11.13, SCA Horizontal Obstruction Template (Example).  (T-2)       Note:  These are minimum distances and may be AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   115  increased.    Consider  such  factors  as  the  availability  of  radar  or  EO/IR  targets  recent NAVAID performance, and time of last navigation system/computer update. 11.15.2.  Significant  and  critical  obstacles.    Using  current  large-scale  charts,  airfield diagrams, airfield sketches, approach plates, and imagery, locate significant obstacles within the boundary of the horizontal template.  Significant obstacles are those within 300 ft of the desired  glide  slope.    Determine  the  HAT  for  each  obstacle  by  subtracting  TDZE  from  the mean  sea  level  (MSL)  elevation  of  the  obstacle.    For  each  obstacle,  plot  the  along-course distance from touchdown and HAT on the critical obstacle graph as shown in Figure 11.14.  Critical Obstacle Chart.  An obstacle is considered critical if it falls above the reference line for the planned glide slope or its extension along the depicted baseline.  (T-2) 11.15.2.1.  For  each  critical  obstacle  identified,  preplan  and  brief  a  specific  means  of avoidance  to  be  used  during  the  approach.    The  following  examples  may  be  used separately or in combination:  (T-2) 11.15.2.1.1.  Use  a  steeper  glide  slope.    Glide  slopes  exceeding  4.0º  should  be carefully considered due to the high rate of descent required. 11.15.2.1.2.  Move the touchdown point further down the runway. 11.15.2.1.3.  Increase MDA. 11.15.2.1.4.  Establish  an  intermediate  step-down  altitude  above  the  MDA  at  which the aircraft will level off until positive separation from the obstacle is assured. 11.15.2.1.5.  Change  the  approach  to  the  opposite  end  of  the  runway,  crossing runway, parallel runway, etc. 11.15.2.2.  Draw  the  relative  position  of  each  critical  obstacle  on  the  template  and annotate its distance-to-go, distance abeam final course centerline, and height (AGL and MSL).

For planning, allow a minimum of 0.3 nm along track error and 0.3 nm cross track error at the MAP.  Assume IMC when choosing the missed approach/departure flight path.  Construct a horizontal obstacle clearance template beginning at the MAP and incorporating the planned missed approach/departure flight path.  Use TDZE as the MSL start point for the missed approach.  If the terrain along this flight path (including the  above  errors)  rises  at  a  rate  greater  than  200  ft/nm,  refer  to  the  performance  manual  to verify  that  three-engine  climb  out  will  clear  terrain.    Use  the  three-engine  climb  angle  in place of glide slope (refer to formula in Table 11.2).  (T-2) Table 11.2.  Example Horizontal Obstacle Clearance Formula.  11.15.3.1.  The  horizontal  obstacle  clearance  template  for  climb  out  extends  from  the approach  end  of  the  runway  out  to  1.0  nm  past  level  off  at  the  initial  escape  en  route altitude.    The  lateral  limits  of  the  climb  out  template  are  the  same  as  for  the  straight-in approach.  (T-2) 11.15.3.1.1.  If any critical obstacles are identified, consider using turns during climb out  to  avoid  them.    Ensure  that  the  three-engine  climb  path  provides  sufficient clearance from obstacles and terrain along the flight path.  (T-2) 11.15.4.  SCA Vertical Template Construction.  Starting at the touchdown zone, construct a glide slope using the desired gradient (ft/nm) to a point along the final  approach course (or transition  path,  if  applicable)  where  it  intercepts  the  planned  approach  altitude  (refer  to Figure 11.15).  Annotate the glide slope MSL and AGL altitudes for each 0.5 nm distance-to-go increment out to the planned descent point.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   119  Figure 11.15.

In  addition  to  the  duties  listed  in  the  flight  manual,  other  applicable  technical orders, and this instruction, the PIC may assign other duties to the FE, as necessary.  Except for ferry  flights,  hostile  environment  repair,  and  C-130  operations  with  suspected  fuel  tank  foam fires these items need not be briefed and will be performed as normal procedures.  (T-2) 12.2.  Fuel Management.  In order to comply with the intent of Primary Fuel Management and provide  the  greatest  flexibility  for  maintenance  and  operations,  standard  ramp  fuel  loads  in excess of 30,000 pounds should be loaded as follows: 12.2.1.  Outboard main tanks.  7,800 pounds each is the minimum to be considered full. 12.2.2.  Inboard main tanks.  7,200 pounds in each tank is the minimum to be considered full. 12.2.3.  Operational  commitments,  availability  of  fuel  services,  or  planned  landing  criteria will in some cases, dictate that these procedures be adjusted; however, every effort should be made to comply with these guidelines and the flight manual to maximize airframe life. 12.3.  Forms  Management.  In  addition  to  the  procedures  in  TO  00-20-1  and  AFI  11-401,  the flight  engineer  will  assist  the  PIC  in  maintaining  the  AFTO  Form  781  series.    Verify  the exceptional release is signed before starting engines and resigned, if necessary, at en route stops.  (T-2) 12.3.1.  After  each  flight,  ensure  the  number  of  landings,  flight  duration  time(s),  etc.,  are entered on the AFTO Form 781H.  Review all AFTO Form 781A discrepancies and ensure clear,  detailed  entries  are  made,  symbols,  and  date  discovered,  are  entered  for  each discrepancy and the discovered blocks are annotated appropriately.  (T-2) 12.4.  Flight monitoring.  The flight engineer will monitor aircraft systems during all phases of flight  and  ground  operations.    Notify  the  PIC  of  all  abnormal  indications  and  take  appropriate action.  (T-2) 12.4.1.  Maintain outside vigilance when flight deck duties allow.  (T-2) 12.4.2.  Monitor the primary radio, interplane radio, and interphone Net.  (T-2) 12.4.3.  Advise and assist the pilot in maintaining required climb and cruise power.  (T-2) 12.4.4.  State “17,000” over interphone when any engine torque approaches this value.  (T-2)   Note:  In the event of an inadvertent over-torque, refer to Table 12.1.  Carefully consider the over-torque actions criteria in order to determine mission impact.  (T-2) Table 12.1.  Over-Torque Actions. Torque Reading (in-lbs.) Required Actions 19,600 – 21,500 781A Entry.  Historical tracking only.  No inspection required. 21,500 – 23,000 781A Entry.  Visual inspection within 25 flight hours. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   121  Over 23,000 781A Entry.  Maintenance required for NDI and engine mounts change within 25 flight hours.  Mag plug check.  Reduction Gearbox may require change if gearbox oil pressure is lower than before over-torque. WARNING:  Failure to comply with these criteria could result in catastrophic structural failure. Note:  The 25-flight hour limit is based on flight time to return the aircraft for maintenance.  AFSOC aircraft that experience an over-torque over 23,000 in-lb are to immediately return the aircraft for inspection and required maintenance. 12.4.5.  Notify the pilot when either of the following conditions is noted:  (T-2) 12.4.5.1.  Deviation of more than 200 ft from assigned altitude. 12.4.5.2.  The aircraft configuration is incorrect for the maneuver being performed. 12.5.  Prestrike/Poststrike  Checklists.  When  the  Prestrike  checklist  is  initiated,  ensure  the aircraft is configured to enter the combat environment.  When the Poststrike checklist is initiated, ensure  the  aircraft  is  configured  properly  (tactical  environment  permitting)  for  recovery  to  the landing airfield.  (T-2) 12.6.  AF Form 4064, C-130 TOLD Card: 12.6.1.  Complete  TOLD  card  for  takeoff  prior  to  the  BEFORE  STARTING  ENGINES CHECKLIST.  (T-2) 12.6.2.  Complete data applicable to the type of takeoff and landing to be made (i.e., landing distance for normal landing).  (T-2) 12.6.3.  Record  computed  data  in  accordance  with  the  flight/performance  manual  and  this instruction.  (T-2) 12.6.4.  Base  all  performance  data  on  95  percent  engine  efficiency  unless  mission requirements  dictate  otherwise.    Calculate  an  additional  torque  value  based  on  100  percent engine efficiency so you can identify the actual efficiency of the engines when setting takeoff power.  Do not accept an engine that produces less than 95 percent efficiency.  (T-2) 12.6.5.  TOLD  card  computations  will  be  accomplished  using  the  appropriate  performance manual, approved tabulated data, or approved TOLD Computer.  (T-2) 12.6.6.  Record  adjusted  speeds  to  be  used.    For  example,  record  minimum  control  speed (one engine inoperative in ground effect) as takeoff speed if minimum control speed is higher than computed takeoff speed.  (T-2) 12.6.7.  Computed data must equal or exceed the requirements of this instruction.  (T-2) 12.6.8.  Following  initial  takeoff  and  landing  recalculate  affected  speeds  if  favorable conditions  afford  an  additional  margin  of  safety  in  all  other  areas  (e.g.,  gross  weight decreases  due  to  fuel  burn  off,  while  pressure  altitude  and  temperature  remain  constant).  New data is required for pressure altitude changes of 1,000 ft, gross weight changes of 5,000 pounds, or temperature change of 5ºC.  (T-2)   122  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 12.6.9.  The  minimum  TOLD  card  computations  (airspeeds)  required  for  a  termination landing  are:    Air  Minimum  Control  Speeds,  Obstacle  Clearance  Speed,  3-Engine  Climb Speed, 100 & 50% Flap Landing Speeds and Distances, 0% Flap Landing Approach Speed (Night or IMC), and 3 Eng ft per nautical mile.  (T-2) 12.6.10.  AF  Form  4063,  Pilot  Information  Card.    OG/OGV  is  authorized  to  approve overprinting  the  blank  blocks  of  the  AF  Form  4063,  Pilot  Information  Card  (Mini  TOLD Card).  Submit information copies to HQ AFSOC/A3V upon approval.  (T-3) 12.6.11.  When  practicing  no-flap  landings,  compute  both  Air  Minimum  Control  Speed (Vmca) for 50 percent flaps and for no flap configuration (low rudder boost).  Record both sets of speeds on the TOLD card.  (T-2) 12.6.12.  When cruise time will exceed 4 hours, the flight engineer will post applicable cruise data 1 hour after the start of the cruise.

(T-2) 13.5.3.2.  Linked 30mm ammunition may be left in AHS provided no rounds extend past the flexible feed chutes into the hard chutes.  Place all un-linked 30mm rounds, regardless of  serviceability,  in  an  empty  ammunition  can.    If  possible,  place  serviceable  and unserviceable rounds in separate ammunition cans.  Serviceable rounds may be re-linked and placed in AHS.  (T-2) 13.6.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Maintain  emergency  exits  and  safety  aisles  IAW appropriate configuration/mission planning guide.  (T-2)   126  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 13.7.  Cargo Loading/Downloading. 13.7.1.  AFSOC AC-130 aircraft do not routinely airlift channel cargo; however, if so tasked, coordinate  with  the  air  terminal  operations  center  (ATOC),  airlift  control  element,  or  air freight/passenger service to obtain the cargo and passenger breakdown and assist in planning of proposed load.  Security requirements for ammunition and weapons will be briefed to the AG during the initial load briefing by ATOC personnel.  (T-2) 13.7.2.  Normally  all  air  freight,  fleet  service,  and  servicing  personnel  are  authorized  to perform  assigned  duties  in  all  AFSOC  aircraft  when  escorted  by  an  authorized  individual.  Air freight personnel are responsible for completion of cargo documentation, palletizing, and movement  of  cargo  to  and  from  the  aircraft.    They  will  advise  the  AG  of  destination,  size, weight,  and  type  of  cargo  (classified,  hazardous,  etc.)  to  permit  proper  positioning; coordinate traffic  activities that may  affect  loading and offloading;  and assign sufficient  air freight  loading personnel for cargo handling.  Air freight  personnel  are responsible for safe positioning  of  material  handling  equipment  and  cargo  to  and  from  aircraft  cargo  ramp  or auxiliary  ground  loading  ramps.    Air  freight  personnel,  under  the  direction  of  the  AG, prepare  the  aircraft  for  loading  or  stowing  loading  equipment  if  the  aircraft  is  not  to  be reloaded,  tiedown,  and  physically  offload  cargo.    If  cargo,  aircraft  equipment,  or  aircraft structure  are damaged during loading  or offloading, or if loading personnel  are injured, the AG will notify the AC, command post, or terminal operations officer.  (T-2) 13.7.3.  The  AG  is  responsible  for  aircraft  preflight;  load  planning;  preparation  of DD Form 3654,  operation  of  aircraft  equipment;  supervision  and  direction  of  loading, offloading,  tiedown,  and  coordination  with  loading  crew  supervisor  for  checking  the  cargo against  manifests.    The  AG  is  responsible  for  safe  movement  of  cargo  into  and  out  of  the aircraft.  (T-2) 13.7.4.  At  locations  with  no  air  terminal  or  traffic  personnel,  the  shipper  assumes responsibilities in Paragraph 13.2.1. 13.7.5.  Cargo  will  be  loaded  and  restrained  IAW  TO  1C-130A-9,  Cargo  Loading  Manual.  (T-2) 13.7.6.  At  stations  where  aircraft  tiedown  equipment  is  exchanged,  make  every  effort  to ensure that a one-for-one exchange occurs.  If this is not possible, the AG will inform the PIC of  lost  or  missing  equipment,  make  an  AFTO  Form  781  entry  for  the  discrepancy  and annotate missing items on the AFSOC Form 31, Aircraft -21 Equipment Inventory.  (T-2) 13.8.  Passenger Handling. 13.8.1.  Most  personnel  carried  aboard  AFSOC  aircraft  are  aboard  to  perform  a  specific mission.    Every  effort  should  be  made  to  advise  them  of  mission  progress  and  deviations.  The troop commander should be identified prior to boarding. 13.8.1.1.  Determine  if  the  troop  commander  has  any  special  requirements  prior  to departure, and advise the PIC of these requirements, if appropriate.  (T-2) 13.8.1.2.  Determine if specific communications requirements exist and coordinate these requirements with the PIC.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   127  13.8.1.3.  Ensure that troops do not have access to classified aircraft equipment during the mission unless required and authorized.  If troops require access to classified equipment, the requirement should be made known to the PIC prior to the mission.  (T-2) 13.8.2.  AFSOC aircraft will not normally be tasked to support AMC passenger missions, nor will passengers be manifested or loaded aboard AFSOC aircraft without the prior approval of the aircraft/mission commander.  (T-2) 13.8.2.1.  Prior  to  releasing  seats,  ensure  terminal  operations  passenger  handling personnel are aware that passenger comfort latrine facilities are extremely limited, and of the possibility of an in-flight diversion.  (T-2) 13.8.2.2.  Space-available passengers will not be transported on AC-130 aircraft.  (T-2) 13.8.2.3.  Ensure  all  classified  equipment  is  covered  prior  to  passenger  boarding  and remains  covered  while  they  are  aboard.    The  AG  is  the  key  figure  concerning  good passenger  relations.  Be aware of the doubts and fears which may arise in  the minds of passengers and anticipate their questions and actions.  (T-2) 13.8.2.4.  Passengers may move about the cargo compartment.  Good judgment must be exercised on the number of passengers allowed out of their seats at one time.  Encourage passengers to keep seat belts fastened when seated.  (T-2) 13.8.2.5.  Do  not  allow  passengers  to  lounge  on  or  tamper  with  equipment,  cargo,  or baggage.  (T-2) 13.8.2.6.  The AG will ensure passengers are properly manifested on the DD Form 2131 or suitable substitute.  Give one copy of the manifest to the PIC for filing with the flight plan  and  retain  sufficient  copies  for  border  clearance.    The  AG  will  complete  anti-hijacking requirements IAW this instruction.  (T-2) 13.9.  Border  Clearance.  Customs,  Immigration,  and  Agriculture  require  certain  forms  for border clearance.  The AG will ensure that required forms are contained in the aircraft mission kit.  Distribute the forms to the crew and ensure their completion prior to landing; deliver them to the proper persons.  Also comply with the requirements of this instruction.  (T-2) 13.10.  Weight and Balance.  Accomplish weight and balance for the aircraft IAW TO 1-1B-50, Weight and Balance, and this instruction.  A basic handbook of weight and balance, TO 1-1B-50, Weight and Balance Data, containing current aircraft status, is maintained by the unit possessing the aircraft which provides a supplemental weight and balance handbook for each aircraft.  This supplemental  handbook  is  in  a  wear-resistant  binder  and  may  not  contain  TO  1-1B-50  if  a certified copy of Chart C provides the current basic weight, basic moment, and basic index.  The binder  will  include  the  applicable  TO  1C-130(M)W-5,  Basic  Weight  Checklist  and  Loading Data.    Also  maintain  the  appropriate  Aircraft  Configuration  /  Mission  Planning  Guide  in  each binder.  (T-2) 13.10.1.  Compute  weight  and  balance  by  using  the  Chart  E  mathematical  (moments) method.    Prepare  DD  Form  365-4  IAW  applicable  Configuration/Mission  Planning Instruction, and applicable TO 1C-130(M)W-5.  (T-2) 13.10.2.  The weight and balance section of the unit possessing the aircraft is responsible for providing  the  appropriate  agency  with  information  required  to  keep  documents  current  and accurate.  (T-2)   128  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 13.11.  Pyrotechnics. 13.11.1.  This  section  provides  information  in  preparation  for  launching  pyrotechnics.  Reference:  TO 11A10-25-7, Storage and Maintenance Procedures – Pyrotechnic Markers, and 11A10-26-7, Storage and Maintenance Procedures – Pyrotechnic Signals. 13.11.2.  Hazards.    In  general,  pyrotechnics  contain  materials  of  a  hazardous  nature.    Even though each of the ingredients in a pyrotechnic composition may be relatively stable within itself, it may react with one or more of the other materials to cause deterioration and create an even greater hazard.  Pyrotechnics are more dangerous than many other types of ammunition because  they  are  more  easily  activated.    These  items  should  not  be  handled  roughly  or exposed to moisture.  When subjected to fire, most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat. 13.11.2.1.  Toxic Hazards.  Many chemicals used in pyrotechnic devices are poisonous if taken  internally.    This  also  applies  to  the  residues  of  burned  pyrotechnics.    From  the inhalation standpoint, the products of pyrotechnic devices and smoke generators present a serious problem.  Although most of the smoke and fumes given off by pyrotechnics are considered nontoxic, heavy concentrations in closely confined spaces are dangerous and may be lethal, as they reduce the amount of available oxygen in the air. 13.11.3.  Handling.    Besides  the  hazardous  basic  compositions,  pyrotechnics  contain sensitive elements such as fuses, friction compositions, and primers.  Pyrotechnics should be handled  with  care  and  protected  against  moisture,  shock,  friction,  or  heat.    Care  should  be taken  to  avoid  premature  ignition  or  damage  that  may  cause  failure  when  fired.    Boxes containing  pyrotechnics  should  not  be  dropped  or  thrown.    Protective  or  safety  devices should not be removed until just before use.  Care should be taken to avoid damage to fiber cases and rip cords located outside the casing of flares.  Pyrotechnics should be handled so as to avoid denting or deforming the barrel or case.  Do not use pyrotechnics which are dented, deformed, cracked, broken, or have signs of advanced rust, or have shipping covers with an illegible information.  Pyrotechnics  will  be  handled  only  under  the  supervision  of  a  competent,  qualified  person.  Most pyrotechnics burn with intense heat; therefore, personnel should be adequately prepared to handle an emergency situation (e.g., heat resistant gloves and broom).  (T-2) lot  number,  manufacture  date,  or  other  required identifying 13.11.4.  Storage.    Units  which  have  a  requirement  for  storing  pyrotechnics  will  obtain  a license from the host base.  (T-2) 13.11.5.  Issue Procedures.  Pyrotechnics which have been issued  for training purposes will be  marked  in  bold  capital  letters  with  the  word  “TRAINING.”    These  pyrotechnics  will always be stored separately from operational stock within storage areas.  (T-2) 13.11.6.  Safety.    All  of  the  pyrotechnics  described  contain  combustible  chemicals  which, when  ignited,  generate  a  flame  or  smoke  (or  combination  of  both)  for  a  broad  variety  of purposes.    These  purposes  include  visual  signaling,  area  or  target  illumination,  and  point marking.  Most are intended to burn with intense heat. 13.11.6.1.  Initiation Mechanism.  Pyrotechnic devices normally are equipped with some type of safety pin, lock, or tape designed to prevent accidental activation of the initiation mechanism.  Any pyrotechnic that shows sign of damage to safety features is considered unserviceable and must be carefully segregated for prompt disposition by EOD.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   129  13.11.6.2.  Accidental Initiation.  If a pyrotechnic device should be accidentally ignited, in  all  cases  its  functioning  will  result  in  a  fire  hazard.    The  gases  generated  by  this combustion could present a serious toxic hazard.  Signaling devices containing propellant charges create an extremely dangerous missile hazard if accidentally ignited. 13.11.6.3.  Fighting  Pyrotechnic  Fires.    Pyrotechnic  compositions  characteristically contain  their  own  oxidants,  and  therefore  do  not  depend  upon  atmospheric  oxygen  for combustion.  For this reason, excluding air from a pyrotechnic fire usually is ineffective.  Many  pyrotechnic  mixtures,  particularly  illuminating  flare  compositions,  burn  with intense heat up to 4,500 degrees F.  Normally, available extinguishers are of little or no value in fires of this kind, and in addition, may produce toxic or poisonous gases. 13.11.6.4.  Safe Altitudes and Distances.  Flares not entirely burned out and cooled when they land may ignite combustible material.  Safe altitudes and distances depend upon the burning  time,  rate  of  descent,  and  drift  of  the  flare.    Such  factors  will  be  considered  in determining minimum altitudes and distances of release.  Signal flares are also a potential fire  hazard  when CAUTION:  Flares will not be launched over areas subject to fire except in an extreme emergency.    If  such  an  emergency  exists,  flares  should  be  dropped  from  sufficient altitude to allow complete burnout before hitting the surface.

(T-2)           WARNING:  Jettison MK 6 markers from the aft cargo door and/or ramp  or available paratroop door.  At no time will any object be jettisoned out of any other location.  (T-2) 13.11.8.3.  MK-25 MOD 3; Marker, Location Marine: 13.11.8.3.1.  Description.  This signal marker provides approximately 13-18 minutes of marker illumination. It is used to mark sightings at sea, make sea evaluations, and to simulate targets for the firing of weapons. It may be used to provide smoke on land if a fire hazard does not exist. 13.11.8.3.2.  Operation.  To activate the marker, the base plate must be rotated from the  safe  to  the  armed  position  to  allow  the  battery  cavity  ports  to  be  opened.    The ports are opened by pressing the two brass colored port plugs into the battery cavity using  the  thumb  and  forefinger.    A  one-pound  force  is  required  for  plug  removal.  This  device  is  considered  to  be  a  sealed  unit  until  its  base  plugs  (one  or  both)  have been pushed in.  Do Not push in the port plugs until immediately prior to jettisoning the mark.  If a MK 25 must be retained inside the aircraft and the port plugs have not been pushed in, rotate the base plate to the safe position and return it to its package.  The  MK  25  will  not  be  retained  inside  the  aircraft  after  the  port  plugs  have  been pushed in.  (T-2)          WARNING:  The nose end of this marker must be kept out of line with the body or with other personnel at all times.  If marker is initiated, the nose plug is expelled with considerable force creating a missile hazard.  (T-2) 13.11.8.3.3.  Special  Precautions.

General.  This  volume  establishes  procedures  for  AFSOC  Direct  Support  Operators (DSO) and Tactical Systems Operators (TSO) for employment on AC-130W aircraft.  In addition to  the  duties  listed  in  applicable  technical  orders,  directives,  and  this  instruction,  the  PIC  may assign other duties as necessary.  The DSO/TSO is primarily responsible for providing inputs to enhance  aircrew  SA.    For  the  purpose  of  this  chapter  the  DSO  and  TSO  will  be  referred  to  as “operator.”    The  mission  requirements  will  determine  whether  a  DSO  and/or  a  TSO  will  be employed. 14.2.  Mission Planning Factors. 14.2.1.  Mission  Planning.    Detailed  information  on  mission  planning  can  be  found  in AFTTP 31.General  Planning(S),  General  Planning  and  Employment  Considerations, and  Considerations, AFTTP 31.Threat  Guide(S), AFTTP 31.AC130W(S) and AFTTP 33.AC130W(U) (or equivalent), Combat Aircraft Fundamentals. equivalent),  Combat  Aircraft  Fundamentals, (or Threat Reference  Guide 14.2.2.  The  operator,  after  coordinating  with  the  supporting  analyst  and  other  appropriate agencies,  will  conduct  mission  planning  with  the  aircrew  of  all  combat  mission  scenarios.  The operator will brief expected scenario inputs based on the analytical data, as required.  (T-2) 14.2.3.  The  operator  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  all  appropriate  agencies  to  obtain all  required  or  anticipated  mission  planning,  professional,  and  mission  equipment  for  the duration of the flight/deployment.  The operator will ensure all equipment is inventoried and inspected prior to flight/deployment.  (T-2) 14.3.  Preflight/In-flight Responsibilities.  The operator will:  (T-2) 14.3.1.  Brief the crew on the mission equipment configuration and anticipated inputs. 14.3.2.  Ensure  the  crew  is  aware  of  mission  capabilities  and  limitations,  as  well  as operational security considerations. 14.3.3.  Monitor SA information and relay pertinent information to the crew. 14.3.4.  Advise the crew of any change in the status of mission equipment. 14.3.5.  The operator is  responsible for knowing  approximate aircraft location, altitude, and intentions at all times. 14.4.  Communications Procedures.  When missions require the operator to communicate, they will obtain proper frequencies, time hack, schedules, and call signs prior to flight.  Depending on the  nature  of  the  mission  and  the  communications,  the  operator  will  keep  the  crew  updated  on any  pertinent  information  and  will  coordinate  with  the  PIC  for  authorization  to  transmit.    On AC130W aircraft, the operator will coordinate with the crew during mission planning regarding interphone connectivity.  (T-2) 14.5.  Post Mission.  In addition to appropriate debriefs, the operator will also ensure:  (T-2) 14.5.1.  Equipment write-ups are passed on to maintenance.   132  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 14.5.2.  Post mission Technical Summary inputs are provided to the supporting analyst. 14.5.3.  Provide information to their units summarizing mission events, as required. 14.6.  Augmentation.  Some contingency operations may require operators from other units, or in some cases, non-aircrew personnel to provide cryptologic support.  In these cases, a mission-ready instructor-qualified operator will fly as primary operator, and be responsible for operator inputs.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   133  Chapter 15 AC-130W EMPLOYMENT 15.1.  General.  This chapter describes the specific equipment requirements, training restrictions, and regulatory guidance for AC-130W employment.  This chapter is not a stand-alone reference and should be used in conjunction with the rest of this instruction, the AFTTP series, and other directives.  All crew members must actively participate in keeping tactics and publications up to date.    Submit  proposed  publications  and  tactics  changes  to  HQ  AFSOC/A3V  IAW  this instruction.  (T-2) 15.1.1.  Employment  Decisions.    The  PIC  is  the  decision  authority  on  tactics  and employment.    They  are  responsible  for  risk  assessment  and  mission  execution.    Select weapons  and  munitions  prior  to  flight  whenever  possible.    This  is  not  intended  to  limit flexibility, but to reduce task loading in the employment area.  (T-2) 15.1.2.  Publications.    Joint  terminology  will  be  used  for  mission  planning  and  execution.  Crew members will have a working knowledge of the information contained in the following publications:    JP  303,  Joint  Interdiction;  JP  309.1,  Joint  Laser  Designation  Procedures (JLaser); JP 309.3, Joint Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Close Air Support (CAS).  Crew  members  will  also  maintain  a  working  knowledge  of  AFTTP(I)  32.6,  Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, And Procedures For The Joint Application Of Firepower (JFIRE).  (T-2) 15.2.  Minimum  Operating  Equipment.  Refer  to  Table  15.1,  Tactical  Operations,  for minimum tactical equipment requirements.

DST is used to prepare crews to accomplish the mission  simulating  certain  pieces  of  equipment  inoperative  or  intentionally  turned  off  for emission control. 15.2.1.1.  The equipment simulated as inoperative, aircrew coordination, crew duties, and disorientation/emergency procedures will be briefed prior to flight.  (T-2) 15.2.1.2.  For terminal area operations in mountainous terrain weather must be VMC and the pilot and NAV radar altimeters must be operational and on.  (T-2) 15.2.1.3.  During  SCNS  degraded  operations  the  radar  must  remain  operational  and  on.  (T-2) 15.2.1.4.  An  instructor  must  be  in  either  a  pilot  or  NAV/Combat  Systems  Operator (CSO) position.  (T-2) 15.2.1.5.  The  SCNS  INS  or  GPS  must  be  operational  and  on  during  DST.    Integrated Digital  Control  Units  (IDCU)  and  flight  director  mode  switches  can  be  positioned  to simulate the INS and/or GPS inoperative.  (T-2) 15.2.1.6.  DST Procedures. 15.2.1.6.1.  Radar denied operations.  The radar will be placed in the standby position to simulate an inoperative/unavailable radar.  Having the radar in standby will allow a quick return to normal procedures during limited visibility or in emergency situations (inadvertent  weather  penetration,  emergency  climb,  etc.).    When  operating  at  low altitude,  do  not  place  the  radar  in  standby  if  cloud  cover  degrades  effective illumination.  (T-2) 15.2.1.6.2.  SCNS  degraded  operations.    Simulated  SCNS  degradation  may  be accomplished  during  any  phase  of  flight  regardless  of  the  illumination.    The  flight director mode switches can be positioned to simulate the INS and/or GPS inoperative or the NAV may select a degraded SCNS sub-mode via the IDCU.  Additionally, any crew  position  IDCU  may  be  dimmed.    The  crew’s  primary  navigational  references become  the  CP/NAV  charts  while  utilizing  Brimstone  and  PFPS  moving  map  to enhance SA.  (T-2) 15.2.1.6.3.  C-MIGITS  failure.  Simulate C-MIGITS  failure by turning it off.  VMC required.  (T-2) 15.3.  En Route Operations. 15.3.1.  Altimeter Updates.  The NAV should perform  an altimeter update within 20 nm  of airfields and prior to glide slope intercept for SCAs.  Update locations will be briefed prior to flight as required and verbalized in-flight when conducted.  (T-2) 15.3.2.  Radar  Altimeter.    During  en  route/CAS  operations,  radar  altimeters  will  be  set  per crew discretion but should not be lower than 3,000 ft.  (T-2) 15.3.3.  GCAS.    Normal  mode  (audio  and  visual  on)  will  be  used  during  en  route/CAS operations.  (T-2) 15.3.4.  ETCAS.  Use the Above, Below, and Normal settings as appropriate for the phase of flight and mission.  The Below setting should be used for tactical descents.

Use the following procedures to launch any marker flares or illuminated targets:  (T-2) 15.6.1.1.  “AG, P/CP standby to launch marks.” 15.6.1.2.  “In-progress AG” – Ensure jettison location/paratroop door is open and mark is prepared  according  to  appropriate  launch  preparation  procedures.    Rotate  base  plate  to ARMED at this time. 15.6.1.3.  “AG standing by to launch marks” – Reply when ready to jettison mark. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   137  15.6.1.4.  “AG, P/CP launch marks, now”  – For MK 25, push in port plugs and jettison mark.  For MK 6, pull igniter plug and jettison mark.     Note:  P/CP allow approximately 10 seconds for the AG to arm each MK 25. 15.6.1.5.  “Mark(s)  away”  -  Mark(s)  jettisoned.                Note:    MK  25  flares  burn  for approximately  13  minutes,  if  more  flares  are  needed  the  CP  and  AG  should  pre-coordinate for further launches. 15.7.  Crew Duties.  General crew member responsibilities during CAS:  (T-2) 15.7.1.  The PIC is primary on flying the aircraft and is the final authority on weapons/fusing selection and weapons release parameters. 15.7.2.  The CP is primary for SCNS operation and ATC, C2, and air stack communications. 15.7.3.  While stationed on the Mission Operator Pallet (MOP), the NAV is primary for M1 sensor operations, battlefield SA and friendly position SA. 15.7.4.  The  CSO,  as  the  MOP  Lead,  is  primary  for  M2  sensor  operations,  ground  party communications,  weaponeering,  targeting,  fire  control  systems,  battlefield  SA  and  friendly position SA. 15.7.5.  Once  the  NAV  transitions  to  the  MOP,  the  FE  assumes  control  of  all  flight  deck NAV panel equipment and is primary for monitoring defensive systems. 15.7.6.  The  AGs  are  primary  for  scanner  duties  and  weapon  systems  monitoring  and operation, to include movement of CLT between the storage rack and the cargo door. 15.8.  Pre-Strike Coordination. 15.8.1.  Order of Battle (OB) Analysis.  The CSO and NAV will coordinate with intelligence personnel to obtain a current and complete OB for the area of operations.  Based on analysis of  the  OB,  the  CSO  and  NAV  will  ensure  the  planned  route  of  flight  minimizes  aircraft exposure to the threat and the probability of detection.  (T-2) 15.8.2.  Chart  Preparation.    Use  1:50,000  Topographical  Line  Maps  (TLM)  for  all  CAS objective areas when available; however, charts smaller than 1:250,000 should not be used.  Grid lines must be clearly displayed for accurate point annotation.  A 10 nm minimum safe altitude (MSA) will be computed for every assigned objective area.  (T-2) 15.8.3.  During  CAS,  the  NAV  repositions  to  the  cargo  compartment  to  perform  primary crew duties on the MOP. 15.8.3.1.  Prior to the repositioning to the MOP the NAV will give a navigation hand-off briefing  to  the  CP  and  FE.    The  briefing  will  cover:    radar  set  up,  SCNS  settings, BULLSEYE,  steering,  defensive  system  settings,  MEA,  MSA,  and  general  situation  (to include distances to SUA/Airspace Control Measures (ACM)).  (T-2) 15.8.4.  Navigation.   Once the NAV has transitioned to  the MOP, the pilots  are responsible for en route and tactical navigation.  SCNS will be primary for en route navigation.  Tactical navigation may be performed via Brimstone or SCNS.  (T-2) 15.8.4.1.  Brimstone will normally be the primary means of navigation within the tactical environment.  The CSO will ensure the Brimstone airspace overlays are loaded onto the work stations.  Workload permitting, the CP/FE should enter relevant tactical navigation   138  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 points into SCNS throughout the mission.  In the event of Brimstone degradation, the CP or FE will input tactical navigation points into SCNS.  (T-2) 15.8.5.  Laser usage.  The AC-130W has capabilities for laser designation, range finding, and illuminating.    All  air-to-surface  laser  operations  on-range  will  be  IAW  AFI  13-212,  Range Planning  and  Operations,  this  instruction,  and  local  range  procedures.    Off-range  laser emissions  are  authorized  IAW  AFI  11-214  Air  Operations  Rules  and  Procedures.    The following  paragraphs  contain  information  discussing  operation  of  the  airborne  Switchable Wavelength  Laser  Subsystem  (SWLS)  and  Laser  Illuminator  (LI)  systems.                  Note:  Aircrews will use J-Laser terminology when talking with air and ground forces.  (T-2) 15.8.5.1.  SWLS.  The 1.06 micron SWLS (designator) will only be fired in combat or on laser approved ranges.  If ground parties are present they will be advised prior to lasing.  At no time will the 1.06 micron SWLS be used during dry fires outside of laser approved ranges.  The 1.57 micron SWLS (range finder) may be used to simulate the 1.06 micron SWLS in dry fire areas while complying with the 80m minimum slant range, IAW AFI 11-214.    Due  to  the  requirement  for  an  elevation  update  to  the  fire  control  system,  the NAV/CSO may have to frequently fire the 1.57 micron SWLS throughout the course of the  mission.    The  AC  will  advise  the  NAV/CSO  if  it  is  unsafe  to  fire  the  1.57  micron SWLS.    (T-2)            WARNING:    The  NAV/CSO  will  notify  the  crew  prior  to  firing  the 1.06 micron SWLS laser.  On training missions they will only be fired on laser-approved live-fire ranges.  If ground parties are present they will be advised prior to lasing.  (T-2)       WARNING:  Crew members will not use binoculars during any lasing operations when weather is in close proximity to the aircraft or when firing a non-eye-safe laser.  (T-2) 15.8.5.1.1.  When  cleared  by  the  PIC,  the  NAV/CSO  will  state  “LASER  COMING ON” prior to firing the 1.06 micron SWLS.  The crew will avoid looking out of the aircraft.  Upon completion of firing the designator, the NAV/CSO will state “LASER OFF” to notify the crew that the laser designator is off.  (T-2) 15.8.5.2.  Laser  Illuminator (LI).  The  LI is  authorized for use in  live and dry fire areas while complying with the 732m minimum slant range, IAW AFI 11-214. 15.8.5.2.1.  When  cleared  by  the  PIC,  the  NAV/CSO  firing  the  LI  will  state “SPARKLE  ON”  prior  to  firing  the  LI.    To  notify  the  crew  that  the  LI  is  OFF,  the NAV/CSO will state “SPARKLE OFF.”  (T-2) 15.9.  Air-to-Surface and Air-to-Air Training. 15.9.1.  AFI  13-212  is  the  parent  instruction  for  all  AF  ranges.    Wings/Groups  will  publish range procedures for frequently used weapons ranges  IAW AFI 13212, Vol  1 and  Chapter 10 to this instruction.  (T-2) 15.9.1.1.  If  not  using  an  AF  range  aircrews  will  use  the  component/Host  Nation  range procedures.  (T-2) 15.9.2.  Aircraft bank will be limited to 60º and pitch is limited to +/- 15º.  (T-2) 15.9.3.  AFI 11-214 describes minimum weather requirements for training. 15.9.3.1.  Air-to-surface minimum weather will be sufficient to allow the crew to visually observe the round to impact.

Visually clear the target area and weapon safety footprint areas on AF Class B and Class C ranges before live firing.  (T-2) 15.9.4.2.  Visually  clear  the  target  area  and  weapon  safety  footprint  areas  at  non-AF ranges.  (T2) 15.9.4.3.  The  crew  will  contact  the  range  controller  to  determine  the  ground  parties’ status  and  contact  ground  parties,  as  required,  as  a  prerequisite  to  the  CSO  calling  the range  clear  for  live-fire  operations.    The  CSO  will  coordinate  with  the  NAV  to  ensure range clearance and state, "Pilot, CSO is satisfied the range is clear" when complete.  (T-2) 15.9.4.4.  Range Clearance.  The PIC or CP will call the range controller providing firing clearance and advise them of "going hot.”  The PIC will ensure all range restrictions have been met, proper clearance is attained and the range is clear prior to authorizing the AG to put the gun on line and use of the laser designator.  (T-2) 15.9.4.5.  Modify  these  procedures  as  necessary  in  order  to  comply  with  different ordnance delivery regulations/procedures at off-station locations.  (T-2) 15.10.  Dry-Fire Operations. 15.10.1.  On sorties accomplishing both  live and dry fire objectives, the PIC will notify the crew  whether  to  accomplish  live  or  dry  fire  actions  during  the  target  briefing  of  the  Pre-Strike checklist.  (T-2) 15.10.2.  AGs will not forward rounds into the 30mm gun during dry fire operations.  During all dry fire operations, all calls to bring the gun online will be prefaced with “simulated.”  (T-2) 15.11.  Live-Fire  Operations.  WARNING:    Any  crew  member  detecting  an  unsafe  condition during  live  fire  will  call  "CEASE  FIRE."    Firing  will  not  resume  until  the  unsafe  condition  is corrected.  (T-2) 15.11.1.  Maintain  a  minimum  of  1,000  ft  altitude  separation  from  the  highest  known trajectory  during  combined  live-fire  operations  with  ground  artillery,  mortar,  or  helicopter fire.  (T-2) 15.11.2.  Danger  Close.    JP  3-09.3,  Close  Air  Support  (CAS),  defines  danger  close  as  the 0.1%  probability  of  incapacitation  (PI)  based  on  Joint  Munitions  Effectiveness  Manual (JMEM) data.  AC-130W danger close distances are listed in  AFTTP(I) 3-2.6,  JFIRE.  For targets  inside  the  0.1%  PI,  the  ground  commander  or  authorized  controller  (fire  support officer,  team  leader,  etc.),  must  accept  responsibility  for  risk  to  friendly  forces  IAW  JP  3-09.3  by  passing  his  initials  or  stating,  “CLEAR  DANGER  CLOSE.”    If  the  mission  is preplanned, the ground commander or designated representative should pre-brief acceptable minimum engagement distances. 15.11.3.  Peacetime  Restrictions.    The  following  restrictions  apply  to  all  peacetime  live-fire training  missions.    These  restrictions  do  not  apply  anytime  the  Ground  Forces  Commander (GFC)  requests  fire  support  under  CJCSI  3121.10,  Standing  Rules  of  Engagement  for  US Forces.   140  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 15.11.3.1.  A  tweak  will  be  completed  prior  to  live  fire  training  with  ground  personnel.  (T-2) 15.11.3.1.1.  Crews will select a tweak target a minimum of 750 meters away from all ground  parties  to  compensate  for  untweaked  system  accuracy  and  fragmentation effects.    Once  the  tweak  is  complete  and  the  fire  control  system  has  been  verified accurate  (impacts  are  within  five  mils  of  aim  point),  crews  will  fire  no  closer  to ground parties than 500 meters with 30mm.  (T-2)    WARNING:  During peacetime, never point a trainable gun at a friendly position or slew the sensor while the gun is trainable.  Failure to heed this warning could cause injury or death to friendly forces if inadvertent gun firing should occur.  (T-2)      WARNING:  Use of “Live” function while  not  actively  tracking  a  target  may  result  in  inadvertent  targeting  of  friendly forces.  (T-2)          WARNING:  The NAV/CSO will not engage Automatic Video Tracking (AVT) while firing any weapon.  (T-2) there  has  been  a  gun  alignment,  gun  replacement,  or  M2 15.11.3.1.2.  If removal/replacement  then  increase  distance  from  tweak  target  as  much  as  possible during  initial  tweak  while  maintaining  required  range  buffer.    The  initial  tweak should be performed no higher than 6,000 ft AGL.  (T-2) 15.11.3.2.  Ground  Parties.    The  CSO/NAV  will  notify  the  ground  party  prior  to  use  of the 1.06 micron SWLS, prior to going hot, when tweak is complete, and when ready for calls for fire (if such training is desired).  “Comm out” calls for fire may be performed, but  will  be  requested  and  briefed  by  the  ground  party  prior  to  commencing  and  will  be done at the discretion of the aircrew.  (T-2) 15.11.3.3.  Unplanned  Ground  Parties.    Face-to-face  briefings  are  not  required  when performing live fire training with qualified ground parties on local ranges.  If no face-to-face briefing is accomplished, the ground party will brief the crew on the primary radio frequency  the  following  information  prior  to  commencing  live  fire  training  operations:  Unit  (if  not  already  known),  call  sign(s),  primary  controller  (if  applicable),  radio frequencies,  ground  party  location,  number  of  personnel,  number  of  vehicles,  types  of marking devices, comm out procedures, ground party procedures for hot gun, verify that the  range  has  been  cleared,  number  and  type  of  calls  for  fire  or  other  training  (if applicable).  The NAV/CSO will read back all information.  (T-2) 15.12.  Precision Guided Munitions (PGM) Employment. 15.12.1.  PGM  engagements  are  normally  initiated  by  mission  tasking,  5-line,  or  9-line, depending on situation, munitions type, targeting method (coordinates vs laser guidance) and current  TTPs.    All  available  crew  members  should  record  engagement  information  as  it  is received. 15.12.2.  Both  the  NAV  and  CSO  will  confirm  the  target.    (T-2)              Exception:    During multi-weapon  engagements,  the  PM  and  FE  will  assist  the  NAV/CSO  in  maintaining  PID when only one of them is able to confirm the target.  (T-2) 15.12.3.  Any  crew  member  recognizing  an  incorrect  confirmation  (friendly  or  target)  or incorrect bearing/range will immediately advise the crew.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   141  15.12.4.  The  NAV/CSO  conducting  the  PGM  employment  will  conduct  a  weapons  brief.  (T-2) 15.12.5.  Unless otherwise coordinated, the initiation of the NAV/CSO weapons brief clears the pilots to maneuver the aircraft for weapon(s) employment. 15.12.6.  All  switches  will  be  returned  to  their  pre-launch  condition  after  weapons  impact.  (T-2)  Exception:  The PIC’s Master Arm switch may remain on. 15.13.  30mm Employment. 15.13.1.  Restrictions.  Weather must be sufficient for the CSO to observe round impact.  (T-2) 15.13.2.  A  30mm  engagement  will  normally  be  initiated  by  5-line.    All  available  crew members should record the information as it is received. 15.13.3.  Both  the  NAV  and  CSO  will  confirm  the  target.    (T-2)              Exception:    During multi-weapon engagements.  The PM and FE will assist the NAV/CSO in maintaining PID to the max extent possible.  (T-2) 15.13.3.1.  Any  crew  member  recognizing  an  incorrect  confirmation  (friendly  or  target) or incorrect bearing/range will immediately advise the crew.  (T-2) 15.13.4.  The  CSO  will  conduct  the  weapons  brief  for  30mm  employments.    (T-2)    WARNING:    During  live  fire  procedures,  the  CSO  will  not  depress  the  Gun  Fire  button unless tracking the target and attempting to fire the weapon.  (T-2) 15.14.  RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE. 15.15.  Multiple Weapon Engagements. 15.15.1.  Multiple weapon engagements are normally initiated by 5-line or 9-line, depending on munitions types, targeting method(s) (coordinates vs laser guidance) and current TTP.  All available crew members should record engagement information as it is received. 15.15.2.  The NAV and CSO will confirm their respective targets.  The PM and FE will assist the NAV/CSO in maintaining PID to the max extent possible.  (T-2) 15.15.3.  The CSO will conduct the weapons brief for Multiple Weapon engagements.  (T-2) 15.16.  Delaying Weapon Release. 15.16.1.  Any crew member that observes a condition that may jeopardize a successful safety when utilizing any weapon will call “CEASE FIRE” over the primary NET.  Upon hearing this call:  the CSO selects Inhibit for the 30mm and the PIC turns PGM and Trainable Gun Mount (TGM) Consent Switches Off.  After resolving the issues that led to a “CEASE FIRE” call, the crew will re-accomplish the weapons brief prior to continuing engagements.  (T-2) 15.16.2.  If a crew member observes a situation requiring a pause in 30mm engagement, they will call “CHECK FIRE” over the primary interphone NET.  Upon hearing this call: the CSO selects Inhibit for the 30mm.  The pilot will normally turn Gun consent off after the CSO has selected inhibit.  (T-2) 15.17.  PostStrike Coordination.   142  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 15.17.1.  Run  the  POSTSTRIKE  checklist  upon  completion  of  strike  operations  or  when transitioning between dry fire and live fire operations.  (T-2) 15.17.2.  The CP and FE will brief the following once the NAV is on the flight deck:  radar set  up,  SCNS  settings,  BULLSEYE,  steering,  defensive  system  settings,  MEA,  MSA,  and general  situation  (to  include  distances  to  restricted  operating  zones  (ROZs)  or  other  SUA), departure  plan,  aircraft  configuration,  SCNS  setup  (control  points,  reference  points, waypoints, and BULLSEYEs) radar, and defensive systems.  (T-2) 15.18.  Defensive Tactics. 15.18.1.  Specific  defensive  procedures  are  contained  in  AFTTP  3-1.AC-130W  (or equivalent). 15.18.2.  Practice  Defensive  Maneuvers.    All  crew  members  will  be  advised  of  the  time period  when  they  may  expect  threat  maneuvers.    This  simulated  threat  time  will  provide maximum  safety  to  prevent  personnel  injury  during  the  rapid  changes  of  aircraft  position.  Crew  members  should  be  prepared  for  abrupt  maneuvers  during  any  phase  of  flight  and should  remain  strapped  in  whenever  flight  duties  do  not  require  them  to  move  about  the aircraft.  During training, defensive maneuvers should not feature sustained zero G profiles.  (T-2) 15.19.  Collateral Missions. 15.19.1.  Strike Coordination and Reconnaissance.  Refer to AFTTP 3-1 Volume 1, General Planning  Considerations,  and  AFTTP  3-1.AC-130,  Tactical  Employment,  AC-130.    When working  with  ground  parties,  gunship  crews  will  not  give  weapons  release  authority  unless authority is delegated to the gunship.  (T-2) 15.19.2.  Combat  Search  and  Rescue  (CSAR).    The  AC-130W  should  act  as  On-Scene Commander (OSC) until relieved. 15.20.  Self-Contained  Approach  (SCA).  SCA  procedures  are  used  to  place  the  aircraft  on final  approach,  properly  configured,  in  a  position  to  identify  the  landing  area  and  complete  a landing.  SCA procedures may be used for  approaches to  conventional  airfields.  Comply  with local ATC restrictions and host nation agreements, as appropriate.  (T-2) 15.20.1.  Weather minimums.  All SCAs must be conducted in VMC unless HQ AFSOC/A3 approves  IMC  operations.    If  approved,  IMC  SCA  minimums  will  be  no  lower  than  300  ft and 1 sm.  (T-2) 15.20.2.  SCAs  are  flown  to  a  Minimum  Descent  Altitude  (MDA)  and  Missed  Approach Point (MAP). 15.20.2.1.  MDA.  To compute MDA for VMC or approved IMC operations, add 300 ft to the Touchdown Zone Elevation (TDZE).  (T-2) 15.20.2.2.  MAP.  The MAP is 1 nm distance to go (DTG) on SCNS.  (T-2) 15.20.3.  Glide Slope.  SCAs will normally be planned for a 3-degree glide slope but may be tailored  as  required  for  tactical  consideration.    Plan  to  intercept  a  3-degree  glide  slope  no later than one mile from touchdown unless terrain or obstructions dictate otherwise.  (T-2) 15.20.4.  SCA Procedures. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   143  15.20.4.1.  DESCENT Checklist.  The PF the SCA and NAV will brief the SCA.  (T-2) 15.20.4.1.1.  The  PM  will  check  the  runway  data  in  SCNS  using  approved  sources (the SCA plate, Form 70, Pilot’s Flight Plan and Flight Log, or FLIP approach plate).  (T-2) 15.20.4.1.2.  The  NAV  will  give  course  corrections  to  intercept  the  final  approach course prior to or at the IP.  (T-2) 15.20.4.2.  BEFORE  LANDING  Checklist.   The  PF  will  initiate  the  BEFORE LANDING checklist as required to ensure the aircraft is configured and the checklist is complete prior to glide slope intercept.  (T-2) 15.20.4.2.1.  The PM and NAV will set their radar altimeters to the MDA (normally 300 ft).  The PF may set their radar altimeter as required to provide the most SA for accomplishing the landing (100 ft, 10 ft, etc.).  (T-2) 15.20.4.2.2.  The PM will make mandatory calls IAW Table 5.4 of this guidance.  (T-2) 15.20.4.3.  Glide  Slope  Intercept.    The  BEFORE  LANDING  checklist  should  be completed prior to glide slope intercept. 15.20.4.3.1.  Approaching  glide  slope  intercept,  the  NAV  will  confirm  the  accuracy of the barometric altimeter setting by comparing actual AGL and MSL altitudes with those depicted on the SCA template.  (T-2)      WARNING:  The NAV will verify that the  actual  aircraft  position  is  inside  the  planned  SCA  obstacle  template  prior  to initiating descent.  (T-2) 15.20.4.3.2.  At  the  prescribed  descent  point,  the  NAV  will  state  "Begin  Descent," and  state initial descent rate.  The NAV will provide course and altitude corrections as appropriate (approximately every 1 nm).  (T-2) 15.20.4.3.3.  The  PM  will  back  up  the  PF  on  the  SCNS/instrument  displays.    (T-2)    Note:    The  NAV  and  at  least  one  pilot  will  monitor  the  SCNS  Airborne  Radar Approach (ARA) page for glide slope cross-check.  (T-2) 15.20.4.4.  Landing. 15.20.4.4.1.  The  FE  will  visually  scan  the  runway  and  verbalize  any  conditions preventing a safe landing.  (T-2) 15.20.4.4.2.  The CSO will use a sensor to aid in visual acquisition of the runway and verbalize any conditions preventing a safe landing.  (T-2) 15.20.4.4.3.  Do  not  descend  below  300  ft  until  the  runway  environment  is  visually identified and confirmed by both pilots.  (T-2)        CAUTION:  The M2 sensor will be stowed prior to touchdown.  Both sensors will remain powered on for landing.  (T-2) 15.20.4.5.  Go Around Procedures.  Do not descend below the MDA until the runway is in sight.  A go-around is required when the runway is not in sight at the MAP or a safe landing cannot be made.  (T-2)   144  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 15.20.4.5.1.  The PM will  advise the PF upon arrival at  the MAP and the NAV will state the initial MSL altitude and heading required.  (T-2)        CAUTION:  Pilots are more susceptible to spatial disorientation during NVG go-arounds and departures. 15.21.  Loss of NVG Procedures: 15.21.1.  Airborne.    If  the  P  or  CP  loses  use  of  their  NVGs  inside  of  1  nm,  perform  a  go-around.  (T-2) 15.21.1.1.  If the FE loses use of NVGs, land at the discretion of the PIC.  Use other crew members  and  all  available  sensors  as  necessary  to  clear  for  hazards  and  confirm  the landing zone.  (T-2) 15.21.1.2.  After  takeoff,  continue  the  climb  out  and  follow  the  appropriate  procedures for loss of NVG.  (T-2) 15.21.2.  On  the  Ground.    The  PF  will  determine  whether  to  continue  the  takeoff  roll  as applicable.  The FE should be prepared to turn on overt lighting at the direction of the PIC in case of NVG failure during takeoff or landing roll.  (T-2) 15.21.3.  The  PM  must  be  ready  to  immediately  take  control  of  the  aircraft  if  the  PF experiences  spatial  disorientation  or  an  NVG  malfunction.    When  necessary,  take  the appropriate action required regardless of qualification.  Situation permitting, start a climb to at  least  MSA  until  the  pilot  experiencing  the  problem  is  ready  to  assume  PF  or  PM  duties.  (T-2) 15.22.  Tactical  Recoveries.  Options  are  to  enter  the  traffic  pattern  via  an  initial,  downwind, base,  straight-in,  or  perpendicular  to  the  runway.    During  hostile  activity,  the  pilot  can  control several  factors  that  may  reduce  the  time  in  a  threat  envelope.    These  are  altitude,  arrival  and departure  flight  path,  proximity  to  the  airfield,  and  proximity  to  known  threats.    The  approach must be unpredictable.  Comprehensive mission planning and knowledge of the threat location, density,  and  capability  will  dictate  the  specific  tactics  to  be  employed.    The  recommendations below are some examples; however, ingenuity is the key in determining what type of approach to fly.        WARNING:  Aircrew will conduct a thorough pre-brief of terrain and obstacles in any area where low altitude operations are performed.  (T-2) 15.22.1.  Overhead.  Establish initial on the runway extended centerline and fly the entry at 1,500 ft above field  elevation, pattern altitude, or as cleared by tower and, normally, at 200 KIAS.  (T-2) 15.22.1.1.  Break as the tactical situation permits.  Perform a 45° bank turn and retard the throttles to  flight  idle.   Make a level  turn to  the downwind  leg with  power reapplied  as necessary  to  maintain  150  KIAS.    Delay  configuration  until  established  on  downwind.  And complete the before landing checklist.  (T-2) 15.22.1.2.  Final.  Roll out on final at no less than 300 ft and ¼ nm from the end of the runway.    Airspeed  during  the  turn  to  final  will  be  140  KIAS,  or  approach  speed, whichever is higher.  Slow to final approach speed when established on final.  (T-2) 15.22.2.  Downwind.  Enter a downwind leg for the active runway, normally maintaining 200 KIAS  and  1,000  ft  above  field  elevation  or  traffic  pattern  altitude,  whichever  is  higher.  Position the downwind to allow for a continuous turn to final.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   145  15.22.2.1.  Break.    Break  approximately  ½ nm  past  the  end  of  the  runway  with  a  45° angle  of  bank  and  retard  power  to  flight  idle.    Complete  the  BEFORE  LANDING checklist as airspeed permits.  (T-2) 15.22.2.2.  Final.    Make  a  level  turn  until  reaching  150  KIAS  or  approach  speed, whichever  is  higher,  and  then  descend  at  this  airspeed  while  completing  the  turn.    Roll out on final at no less than 300 ft and ¼ nm from the runway.  Make sure to correct for winds on the approach to prevent over/undershooting.  (T-2) 15.22.3.  Random  steep  approach.    This  maneuver  is  based  on  a  modified  360  degree overhead  approach  to  a  normal  landing.    Conditions  may  require  that  the  example  random steep approach described below be modified to satisfy local conditions (Figure 15.1). 15.22.3.1.  Establish  initial  at  approximately  4,500  ft  AGL  and  accomplish  the  before landing checklist.  (T-2) 15.22.3.2.  When  approximately  one-third  of  the  distance  down  the  runway,  extend  100 percent flaps and commence descent while beginning a 360 degree turn to final.  (T-2) 15.22.3.3.  Maintain 140 KIAS or approach speed, whichever is higher, until wings level on final.  Plan the approach to remain within two miles of the airfield and to enter no less than  a  ¼   mile  and  not  more  than  a  one  mile  final.    The  maneuver  can  be  modified  to enter on other than an initial; i.e., 270° or 90° overhead.  In these cases change the initial altitude according to the pilot’s judgment.  (T-2) 15.22.4.  Random shallow approach.  These maneuvers are based on approaching the airfield from various directions at low en route altitude (e.g. 500 ft AGL) and en route airspeed with the  descent/before  landing  checklist  accomplished.    The  random  shallow  straight-in  and random  shallow  abeam  are  two  examples  of  random  shallow  approaches  (Figure  15.2  and Figure  15.3).    WARNING:    Aircrew  will  conduct  a  thorough  route  study  and  pre-brief  of terrain and obstacles in any area where low altitude operations are performed.  (T-2) 15.22.4.1.  Begin  a  level  slowdown  maneuvering  to  approach  speed  at  a  predetermined point.  While remaining at low altitude, maneuver the aircraft to enter a point on final no less than ¼ nm from the runway, accomplish the before landing checklist, and complete the landing IAW the flight manual.  (T-2) 15.22.4.2.  The  pilot  may  elect  to  make  a  climbing  slowdown  to  normal  traffic  pattern altitude.  Maneuver the aircraft to enter no less than a ¼ nm final, accomplish the before landing checklist, and complete the landing IAW the flight manual.

Random Shallow Tear Drop Approach.  15.23.  AAR.  NATO  publication  ATP  56(B)  Parts  1  and  2  provide  the  basic  guidance  for refueling  terminology  and  procedures.    Crews  will  refer  to  the  aircraft  technical  order  for expanded  receiver  guidance  and  procedures.    The  following  policies  apply  to  all  air  to  air refueling conditions regardless of emission control or type of rendezvous (RV):  (T-2) 15.23.1.  Minimum  crew  requirement.    AAR  qualified  P,  CP  certified  in  AAR  pre-contact, NAV certified in AAR and a FE certified in AAR (or in training under the supervision of an instructor).    (T-2)          Exception:    PIC’s  may  elect  to  have  the  NAV  remain  at  the  MOP during  AAR  as  mission dictates.    In  this  case  the  NAV  may  perform  AAR  duties  from  the MOP, as directed by the PIC. 15.23.2.  Use  manual  boom  latching  procedures  only  during  fuel  emergencies  and contingency  operations.    (T-2)          Exception:    Manual  boom  latching  procedures  are authorized  for  all  AAR  operations  with  the  KC-10A  if  the  tanker’s  independent  disconnect system  is  operational.        WARNING:    Do  not  make  HF  radio  transmissions  during  AAR operations.  (T-2) 15.23.3.  LAIRCM may be left in OPERATE mode during AAR. 15.24.  Formation  Procedures  General.  Formation  is  defined  as  aircraft  maneuvering  with respect  to  a  common  leader  exercising  mutual  support  for  a  common  objective.    For  specific tactical  formation  employment  reference  3-1  and  3-3.AC-130W  (or  equivalent).    This  section prescribes  basic  formation  procedures.    They  are  a  guideline,  primarily  designed  to  be  used  in VMC.  IMC procedures are employed in extraordinary circumstances when IMC is encountered inadvertently or when the mission demands IMC penetration. 15.24.1.  Limit formations to three aircraft.  (T-2)   148  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 15.24.1.1.  Dissimilar  Formations.    Deployment  operations  may  require  different  MDS AFSOC aircraft to fly together in formation.  The minimum lateral spacing for different MDS aircraft will be 500 ft.  If flight in visual conditions is not possible, use pre-briefed IMC  procedures  to  provide  separation  between  aircraft.    The  lead  aircraft  will  direct wingmen to  assume  IMC spacing well prior to  the formation  entering the weather.  For formation  AAR  use  geometries  and  positioning  described  in  ATP-56(B).    (T-2)       WARNING:  When flying alternate formations it may be necessary to modify inadvertent weather penetration procedures. 15.24.2.  Command  and  Control.    Clear  lines  of  command  must  be  established  during formation flight.   This does not prevent other formation members from suggesting a course of  action.    Personnel  in  the  following  roles  will  be  identified  during  mission  planning  and will be annotated on the flight orders (unless noted otherwise):  (T-2) 15.24.2.1.  Airborne  Mission  Commander  (AMC).    The  individual  responsible  for  the overall safe and effective employment of air assets.  Required where mission complexity dictates.  The AMC should not be a primary crew member.  When communicating to the rest of the formation as the airborne mission commander, use that call sign.  (T-2) 15.24.2.2.  Formation  Commander.    Required  on  every  formation  mission.    The designated  commander  of  a  formation  of  aircraft  and  responsible  for  successful completion  of  the  formation's  portion  of  the  mission.    Usually  chosen  from  the  PICs involved in the mission (usually the lead pilot).  The pilot of the lead aircraft (if not the airborne mission commander) is empowered to conduct the mission as planned including any  planned  alternates  and  immediate  actions  necessary  for  formation  safety.    The airborne  mission  commander  has  the  responsibility  to  direct  all  other  changes  to  the mission.  The formation commander works closely  with  the AMC  (if one is  utilized) to accomplish  the overall  mission.  The formation  commander is  usually designated DMC in missions employing a dedicated AMC.  (T-2) 15.24.2.3.  Deputy  Mission  Commander.    Required  on  all  missions  employing  a dedicated  AMC,  on  all  multi-element  formation  missions,  and  on  all  single-element formations of three aircraft or more.  The DMC assumes command if conditions prevent the AMC from controlling the mission.  The DMC may be a primary crew member, and is usually the Formation Commander on AMC controlled missions.  (T-2) 15.24.2.4.  Formation  Lead.    The  lead  aircraft  in  a  formation  flight.    Responsible  for proper mission execution and other immediate action events during a formation flight. 15.24.3.  Specified Times.  The mission commander determines the sequence of events  and mission  times  based  on  staff  input,  fuel  requirements,  user  needs,  taxi  distances,  briefing requirements, etc.  (T-2) 15.24.4.  Pre-takeoff Procedures: 15.24.4.1.  Taxi (formation taxi is optional).  Minimum taxi interval is one aircraft length.  (T-2) 15.24.4.2.  Runway  Positioning.    Aircraft  alternate  sides  with  nose  to  tail  clearance.    If feed-on  method  is  used,  subsequent  aircraft  move  into  takeoff  position  as  preceding aircraft  start  takeoff  roll.    This  method  is  used  when  runway  length  or  gross  weight AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   149  demands the entire runway be used or maximum power be applied prior to brake release.  (T-2) 15.24.5.  Takeoff: 15.24.5.1.  Interval.    Minimum  takeoff  interval  between  aircraft  in  VMC  is  15  seconds.  (T-2) 15.24.5.1.1.  If the weather does not allow a VMC departure the formation will depart single  ship,  minimum  one  minute  separation,  and  rejoin  after  VMC  conditions  are attained.  If VMC cannot be attained fly radar/TACAN in-trail.  (T-2) 15.24.5.2.  Application  of  Power.    To  prevent  damage  to  succeeding  aircraft,  do  not advance power above flight idle until takeoff roll is started.  Use a smooth application of power to  achieve takeoff torque.    If full power is required prior to  brake  release ensure adequate  separation  or  use  feed-on  method.    Lead  will  pre-brief  takeoff  power  settings.  (T-2) 15.24.5.3.  Abort During Takeoff.  If an aircraft aborts during takeoff roll, the NAV/CSO, designated by the PIC, will immediately transmit on inter-plane frequency and the CP on primary  ATC  frequency  (after  completing  emergency  procedures  requiring  immediate action)  the  formation  position  and  the  word  “Aborting”  three  times.    For  example, “Number 1 aborting, Number 1 aborting, Number 1 aborting.”  The aborting aircraft will clear the runway as expeditiously and as safely as possible.  Succeeding aircraft will hold until the runway is clear.  If takeoff run has already been started by succeeding aircraft, they will abort and clear the runway.  (T-2) 15.24.6.  En  Route.    In  the  ATC  environment,  all  aircraft  not  in  a  standard  formation (standard formation is defined as less than 1 mile horizontal separation and less than 100 ft vertical, IAW FAA) will be fully lighted as required by AFI 11-202, Vol 3.  (T-2) 15.24.6.1.  At  night,  lead  will  announce  unplanned  airspeed  changes  of  greater  than  15 knots, unless briefed otherwise.  (T-2) 15.24.6.2.  Aircraft  aborting  after  assembly  will  notify  lead  and  turn  away  from  the formation  and  rejoin  at  the  end  or  proceed  to  a  suitable  recovery  field.    Aircraft  within flight will reposition as briefed.  (T-2) 15.25.  Formation AAR. 15.25.1.  Weather  Minimums.    RV  closure  will  not  be  continued  inside  1  sm  unless  visual contact is established with the tanker.  AAR will not be continued when in-flight visibility is deemed insufficient for AAR operations.  Lead is responsible for weather avoidance during the RV until ½  nm from contact.  Any aircraft in the formation may advise the formation of inclement weather on the refueling track.  (T-2) 15.25.2.  Lead will direct the formation to either a right echelon or in-trail (IMC), stacked up 500 ft, prior to the entry point or rendezvous initial point (RVIP).  Lead will call out the base altitude  and  occupy  that  altitude  while  maintaining  1,000  ft  separation  between  the  highest receiver and lowest tanker.  (T-2) 15.25.2.1.  If visibility is 2 nm or greater.  Wingmen maintain a loose visual, 300 ft nose-to-tail clearance and 150 ft lateral wingtip clearance until lead calls AAR complete.  Lead   150  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 will make this call on air refueling frequency when established in a loose visual position on the tanker’s left wing.  After lead calls AAR complete, number two is cleared to pre-contact.    Number  two  calls  AAR  complete  on  air  refueling  frequency  when  established on  lead’s  left  wing.    After  number  two  AAR  complete,  number  three  is  cleared  to  pre-contact.  Number three will call AAR complete when established on lead’s left side.  (T-2)       WARNING:  Do not cross behind an aircraft in pre-contact/contact.  (T-2)  TOD D.

Point  of  Impact  (PI)—The  point  on  the  drop  zone  where  the  first  airdropped  parachutist  or cargo item lands or is expected to land. Popeye—In air intercept, a code meaning, “In clouds or area of reduced visibility.”  In gunship air-to-surface, a code meaning a visual sensor is no longer able to track the target due to clouds or area of reduced visibility. Quick  Turn—A set of procedures designed to  expedite the movement  of selected missions by reducing ground times at en route or turnaround stations. Rendezvous Control Point (RVCP)—The planned geographic point over which the receiver(s) arrive in the observation/astern position with respect to the assigned tanker. Rendezvous  Initial  Point  (RVIP)—A  planned  geographic  point  prior  to  the  RVCP  to  which tankers  and  receivers  time  independently  to  effect  an  arrival  at  the  RV  control  time.    If  the tanker/receiver  is  not  already  at  its  assigned  RV  FL/altitude,  it  commences  a  climb/descent  to that FL/altitude.  This point may be a designated position established at the planning or briefing stage, or as directed by the tanker/GCI/AEW controlling the RV. Self—Contained  Approach  (SCA)—An  approach  conducted  using  self-contained,  onboard navigation systems. Serial—Any  number  of  aircraft  under  a  commander,  usually  conveying  a  unit  to  a  landing, extraction, or drop zone. Special Tactics  Squadron (STS)—Air Force special operations combat control and pararescue forces. Standby Force, Aircraft, or Crews—Designated aircraft and crews capable of being launched in less than the normal alert-to-takeoff time period. AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   167  Station  Time  (Air  Force)—A specified time at which aircrew, passengers, and material are to be  in  the  aircraft  and  prepared  for  flight.    Passengers  will  be  seated  and  loads  tied  down.  Aircrews  will  have  completed  briefing  and  aircraft  preflight  inspection  prior  to  station  time.  Normally, station time will be 30 minutes prior to takeoff time. Station Time (Airborne)—A specified time when parachutists will be seated in the aircraft with seat belts fastened.  This time normally will be 5 minutes prior to Air Force station time. Supported  Forces—Space-required passengers consisting of US and foreign military members who are on board an AFSOC aircraft as an integral part of the mission being performed. Supporting Forces—Space-required passengers consisting of US and foreign military members, DoD civilians, and US  civilian employees under contract  to  the DoD, who directly support the mission or deployment of an AFSOC unit. Tactical  Control  (TACON)—Command  authority  over  assigned  or  attached  forces  or commands,  or  military  capability  or  forces  made  available  for  tasking,  that  is  limited  to  the detailed  and,  usually,  local  direction  and  control  of  movements  or  maneuvers  necessary  to accomplish  missions  or  tasks  assigned.    Tactical  is  inherent  in  operational  control.    Tactical control  may  be  delegated  to,  and  exercised  at  any  level  at  or  below  the  level  of  combatant command. Time of Fall—The time in seconds for a projectile to travel from the gun muzzle to the target. Time Over Target (TOT)—The actual time an aircraft is at a geographic point or area carrying out an assigned mission. Tweak—A  computation  performed  either  manually  or  by  fire  control  computer  to  correct  for errors  in  weapon  or  sensor  alignment  and  to  solve  for  the  ballistic  wind.    The  purpose  of performing a tweak is to cause ordnance to impact on target.

Zero  Fuel  Weight  (Maximum)—That  weight  expressed  in  pounds  where  an  addition  to  the aircraft gross weight can be made only by adding fuel in wing tanks.  This value is referred to as "Limiting Wing Fuel.”    168  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 Attachment 2 PERSONNEL AIRDROP A2.1.  High-Altitude Personnel Airdrop Planning. A2.1.1.  Airdrop  Planning.    Airdrops  may  be  conducted  in  IMC  and  VMC.    For  detailed information on drop zone (DZ) sizes, markings, types, and weather and wind limits, refer to AFI 13-217,  Drop  Zone  and  Landing  Zone  Operations.    For  information  on  aerial  delivery airspeeds  and  altitudes,  refer  to  AFI  11-231,  Computed  Air  Release  Point  Procedures.  AFI 13217  wind  limits  take  precedence  if  there  are  discrepancies  between  AFI  13-217  and AFI 11231. A2.1.1.1.  The  PIC  and  the  NAV  will  review  the  DZ  survey  during  mission planning/route study.  (T-2) A2.1.1.2.  Airdrop  Computations.    During  mission  planning,  the  NAV  will  compute  a HARP  using  AF  Form  4015,  AF  Form  4017,  or  approved  computer-aided  HARP program.    Both  the  navigator  and  CSO  will  verify  the  results.    At  the  aircraft,  the navigator  will  verify  the  actual  number  of  jumpers  and  parachute  type  matches  the planned HARP  data.  (T-2) A2.1.1.3.  Only  equipment  rigged  in  accordance  with  TO  13C7-series  and  FM  10-500-series or USSOCOM 350-series rigging manuals, properly marked with accurate weights and shipper’s declarations will be airdropped.  Nonstandard equipment and loads require specific  instructions  and  waivers  from  AFSOC/A3V  (AFRC/A3V  for  AFRC  approved missions) and AFSOC/A3VW prior to airdrop.  (T-2) A2.1.1.4.  Minimum  en  route  time  from  takeoff  to  time  over  release  point  will  be sufficient  to  safely accomplish  all required checklists.  For airdrop involving personnel, the jumpmaster must approve en route time of less than 25 minutes.  (T-2) A2.1.1.5.  Jumpmaster  directed require  unit/mission commander approval (SOG/CC may delegate lower).  The user accepts all responsibility for airdrop accuracy and damage to equipment or injury to personnel.  (T-3) (JMD)  personnel  airdrops A2.1.1.5.1.  Specific in-flight  visual  signals,  verbal  signals,  and procedures will be coordinated between the jumpmaster and crew.  (T-2) interphone A2.1.1.5.2.  NAVs  will  accomplish  a  computed  air  release  point  (CARP)  or  high-altitude  release  point  (HARP)  calculation  to  verify  the  jumpmaster’s  computations and (T-2) in-flight directions.   A2.1.1.5.3.  NAVs  will  update  the  jumpmaster  in-flight  on  actual  wind  information and any changes to the briefed computed CARP/HARP location.  (T-2) A2.1.1.5.4.  After  the  slowdown  checks  are  completed,  the  AG  permits  the jumpmaster access to the door to begin spotting procedures.  The slowdown should be adjusted  to  allow  the  jumpmaster  to  begin  spotting  procedures  not  less  than  two minutes out.  The jumpmaster will visually relay steering signals to the AG  to  relay to the P.  The jumpmaster may spot from the aircraft ramp or a paratroop door.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   169  A2.1.1.5.5.  One minute prior to the NAV’s release point (or as briefed), the PM turns on the green light to indicate clearance for the jumpmaster to make a final decision as to  the  exact  exit  point.    Jumpers  may  exit  on  the  jumpmaster’s  direction  while  the green  light  is  illuminated.    The  red  light  is  turned  on  at  the  end  of  the  NAV’s computed  usable  DZ  distance  and  time  or  when  the  last  jumper  or  load  exits, whichever comes first.  No jumpers should exit after the red light is turned on.    (T-2)                  Note:  The AG will not attempt to stop any remaining parachutists after the red light has been illuminated.  The AG will count any parachutists that exit the aircraft after the red light has illuminated.  (T-2) A2.1.1.5.6.  JMD releases will not  be mixed with  any other type of airdrop method.  If  JMD  drop  procedures  are  called  for,  the  crew  will  follow  the  jumpmaster’s instructions, while adhering to normal  safety concerns.  Should the crew believe the drop would occur outside of safe parameters, they will call "No Drop" and ensure the red light is illuminated.  (T-2) A2.1.1.6.  Crews will not perform airdrops using parachutes for which AFI 11-231 does not list ballistics unless the user provides ballistic data or K-factor that has been verified by AFSOC/A3VW.  Aeronautical Systems Division (ASD/ENFC), or US Army Soldier’s System Center Natick can also approve ballistic data or K-factors.  This does not apply to formal test missions where the purpose of the test is to derive ballistic data for a specific load.  (T-2) A2.1.2.  Communication Procedures.   The pilot  flying the airdrop will accomplish  the brief associated with the 20-minute warning.  (T-2) A2.1.2.1.  Training  Operations.    Radio  transmissions  with  the  drop zone  (DZ)  are  those required  for  safety  of  flight  considerations  or  factors  effecting  airborne  force employment.    This  includes  ATC  directions,  range  clearance,  unsafe  surface  conditions or  mission  changes.    When  the  mission  dictates  radio  silence,  transmission  of  wind information and range or drop clearance is not required.  Radio silence procedures will be coordinated prior to mission execution.  (T-2) A2.1.2.2.  Drop clearance is normally inherent with mission clearance to unmanned DZs.  The  aircrew  observing  the  proper  briefed  authentication  confirms  drop  clearance  in VMC.  A no-drop or mission cancellation is communicated by the absence of pre-briefed markings (visual or electronic), jumbled block letter, observation of the block letter X, or red smoke, light, or flare. A2.1.2.3.  In  IMC,  drop  clearance  is  confirmed  via  radio  call  or  beacon  acquisition.    In IMC,  a  no-drop  or  mission  cancellation  is  communicated  by  an  authenticated  radio transmission or absence of the beacon. A2.1.3.  Ramp and Door and Paratroop Door Operations.        WARNING:  The ramp and door and paratroop doors will not be open at the same time during flight.  (T-2) A2.1.3.1.  The P may direct ramp and door/paratroop door opening any time after the six-minute advisory has been completed and clearance from the AG is received.  This option must be planned and briefed prior to  execution.  Consider added drag, power available, climb requirements, built up areas, and the possibility of dropped objects when the door is opened.  (T-2)   170  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 A2.1.3.2.  Multiple Passes (i.e., Racetracks).  When performing multiple personnel drops across the same DZ, checklists may resume at the 6-minute warning assuming no airdrop parameters  or  aircraft  configuration  changes  are  made  from  the  previous  drop.    Ensure the  AG  has  adequate  time  to  complete  all  checklist  items  before  the  drop.    (T-2)            Exception:    During  pilot  directed  airdrops,  the  checklist  may  be  initiated  at  a  point commensurate with the available time and type of drop.  This will be coordinated at the briefing  between  the  crew  and  jumpmaster.    When  airdrop  parameters  or  aircraft configuration  changes  are  made  between  drops,  all  checklists  will  be  accomplished.  Airdrop  time  advisories  and  checklists  may  be  compressed,  except  for  the  one  minute warning.  Doors may remain open at the discretion of the PIC.  (T-2) A2.1.3.3.  If an air deflector door cannot be opened, its respective paratroop door will not be used.  (T-2) A2.1.4.  Airdrops  conducted  above  3,000  ft  AGL  are  considered  high-altitude  drops.    For high-altitude  low-opening  (HALO),  positive  identification  of  the  drop  zone  area  must  be confirmed electronically or visually prior to calling the release.  For HALO or high-altitude high-opening (HAHO), all available navigational aids will be used to assist in positioning the aircraft over the HARP.  (T-2) A2.1.4.1.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible  on  training  and  exercise  missions,  unless prevented by airspace restrictions or other mission factors, update the preflight winds at each  altitude  used  to  compute  the  high-altitude  release  point  (HARP).    Obtain  these winds as near the DZ as possible.  (T-2) A2.1.4.2.  High-altitude  Mission  Requirements.    In  addition  to  the  normal  mission planning requirements, the following are unique to high-altitude operations: A2.1.4.2.1.  Aircrew will ensure all aspects  of HALO/HAHO airdrops are discussed in  detail  at  the  aircrew/jumpmaster  briefing.    Insist  on  positive  feedback  when discussing  HARP  location  and  wind  data  as  well  as  resolving  what  items  will  be passed  to  the  jumpmaster  during  flight.    Terminology  should  be  clear  and unambiguous.  (T-2) A2.1.4.2.2.  For  all  HALO/HAHO  operations,  NAVs  will  provide  the  jumpmaster with a magnetic course +/- 5 degrees and a distance from the release point to the drop zone.    In-flight  changes  to  the  HARP  location  or  significant  wind  changes  will  be relayed to the jumpmaster as soon as possible.  (T-2) A2.1.4.3.  Cabin differential pressure will be managed to have cabin altitude equal to the ambient  pressure  prior  to  completion  of  the  10-minute  checklist.    Depressurization  will not  exceed  3,000  feet  per  minute.    Pressurization  after  the  drop  will  be  maintained  in accordance  with  mission  requirements,  but  should  return to  a  cabin  altitude commensurate to the flight profile and duration as detailed in AFI 11-202, Vol 3 or below 10,000 ft MSL as soon as possible.  (T-2) A2.1.4.4.  High-altitude  Oxygen  requirements.    Only  essential  personnel  who  have accomplished  appropriate  physiological  training  described  in  AFI  11-403,  Aerospace Physiological Training Program, are permitted on mission aircraft for airdrops.  AFI 11-202,  Vol  3  is  the  source  document  for  oxygen  requirements  for  unpressurized  and pressurized  aircraft  operations  and  the  associated  time  limitations.    AFI  11-409,  High-AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015   171  altitude  Airdrop  Mission  Support  Program,  is  the  source  document  for  high-altitude oxygen, prebreathing, and Physiology Technician (PT) requirements/restrictions.  (T-2) A2.1.4.4.1.  Incident  Notification.    USAF/SGPA  and  MAJCOM/SG  will  be  notified by the most expeditious manner of any physiological incident.  (T-2) A2.1.4.4.2.  General  Emergency  Procedures. decompression sickness or unusual pain, the pilot will:  (T-2)  If  any  person  experiences A2.1.4.4.2.1.  Abort  the  mission  and  begin  a  descent  (pressurization  and  descent will be determined by the type and degree of sickness or pain). A2.1.4.4.2.2.  Proceed to the nearest base at which qualified medical assistance is available.  Advise the control tower of the emergency and request a flight surgeon and an ambulance to meet the aircraft. A2.1.5.  No Drop Decisions. A2.1.5.1.  Prior  to  the  2  minute  warning;  notify  the  PIC  when  any  condition  exists  that could jeopardize a safe drop.  (T-2) A2.1.5.2.  After  the  2  minute  warning,  any  crew  member  observing  a  condition  that would jeopardize a safe drop will transmit "No Drop" on the interphone.  (T-2) A2.1.5.3.  A  “No  Drop”  will  be  called  if  all  checklists  are  not  completed  by  the  “10 Second” call.  (T-2) A2.1.5.4.  The PM, NAV, and AG will acknowledge the "No Drop" call.  (T-2) A2.1.5.5.  Stopping  a  drop  in  progress.    Any  crew  member  recognizing  an  unsafe condition during an airdrop will state "Red Light.”  The PM will turn on the red light to signal airdrop termination.  (T-2) A2.1.5.6.  On  personnel  airdrops  where  surface  winds  are  unknown,  advise  the jumpmaster and the airborne ground force commander when drop altitude winds exceed 30 knots.  In this instance, the decision to drop is at the user's discretion.  (T-2) A2.1.5.7.  During training operations, the drop zone safety officer (DZSO) will determine when surface conditions on the DZ are hazardous to airdrop operations.  (T-2) A2.1.6.  Safety Equipment/Precautions. A2.1.6.1.  Mobile crew members in the cargo compartment will wear helmets during all actual  airdrop  operations  from  the  Twenty-Minute  Warning  through  the  completion  of the airdrop checklist.  (T-2) A2.1.6.2.  Eye Protection.  All personnel aft of FS 617 should wear eye protection during any mission requiring doors to be open. A2.1.6.3.  Apply cloth-back tape over inboard CLT storage rack latches to avoid potential entanglement with parachutist and their equipment during exit.  (T-2) A2.2.  High Altitude Personnel Airdrop Procedures. A2.2.1.  Initial Point (IP).  Terrain permitting, the NAV will sequence steering to the airdrop leg in order to roll out on final course guidance without overshooting.  (T-2)   172  AFI11-2AC-130WV3  1 MAY 2015 A2.2.1.1.  Departing the IP (or the slowdown point if one is programmed), the NAV and PM will confirm that the airdrop leg and sensitive steering are active.  (T-2) A2.2.1.2.  The NAV will confirm DZ alignment with radar.  The CSO will  confirm DZ alignment and DZ status if possible.  (T-2) A2.2.1.3.  The  NAV  and  PM  will  visually  confirm  SCNS  position  using  preplanned visual  update  points  and  provide  corrections  if  required.    (T-2)    WARNING:    The  PF must  be  aware  of  paratroopers  standing  in  the  back  and  avoid  abrupt  pitch  or  bank changes after the Six Minute Advisory.  (T-2) A2.2.2.  Slowdown.    Slowdown  at  a  distance  commensurate  with  the  proficiency  of  crew, atmospheric  conditions  (pressure  altitude  and  outside  air  temperature),  and  the  threat environment.  (T-2) A2.2.2.1.  All  controlled  ETA  procedures  should  be  completed  prior  to  reaching  the slowdown point. A2.2.2.2.  After  the  navigator  calls  for  the  slowdown,  the  PF  will  acknowledge  the slowdown call and reduce the throttles (0-1,000 in-lbs of torque).  (T-2) A2.2.3.  Release point. A2.2.3.1.  During  VMC  operations,  the  PM  and  the  NAV  will  confirm  the  aircraft  is positioned within the pre-briefed VMC safety box.  (T-2) A2.2.3.2.  During  IMC  operations,  both  pilots  and  the  NAV  will  confirm  the  aircraft  is positioned within the pre-briefed IMC safety box.  (T-2) A2.2.4.  Escape.  The NAV will call "Red Light" at the expiration of the usable DZ time or upon hearing the AG call "Load Clear," whichever occurs first.  (T-2) A2.2.4.1.  Begin the escape procedure no earlier than the “Load Clear” call.  (T-2) A2.2.4.2.  After the paratroop doors and air deflectors are closed and the flaps have been reconfigured, the remainder of the COMPLETION OF DROP checklist may be deferred if required for threat avoidance. A2.2.5.  Airdrop malfunctions and Off-DZ airdrops.  Reporting of airdrop malfunctions and off-DZ  airdrops  will  be  AFJI  13-210  and  AFI  13-217.    Local  reporting  procedures  will  be detailed in the group or unit supplement to this instruction.  (T-2) A2.3.  Amplified  High-altitude  Personnel  Airdrop  Checklists.  Refer  to  Tables  A2.1-A2.4  (T-2) Table A2.1.  Amplified High-altitude Personnel Airdrop Checklist (P/CP/N/CSO/E).
