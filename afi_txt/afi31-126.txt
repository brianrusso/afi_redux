Responsibilities  and  Functions.  The Department  of the  Air Force  has DoD procurement responsibility for the part of National Stock Class 8820 as it pertains to MWDs. The Air Force has integrated materiel management responsibilities for all MWDs used by the DoD components. The Department of the Air Force, as Executive Agency (EA) for the DoD MWD Program, has assigned  logistical  management  responsibilities  to  341st  Training  Squadron  (TRS),  JBSA-Lackland, TX. and functional user management responsibility to Headquarters, United States Air Force, Directorate of Security Forces (AF/A4S). 1.1.1.  Dog  equipment  and  supply  items  are  available  through  supply  channels  within  each service  department  or  defense  agency.  Each  DoD  Component  will  purchase  its  own equipment. (T-3). 1.1.2.  Responsibility for MWD commodity management, procurement and logistics support is delegated to the 37th Training Wing (TRW), Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA)  - Lackland, TX. The commander, 341st Training Squadron (TRS), JBSA-Lackland, TX, will: 1.1.2.1.  Acquire, evaluate, receive and process prospective MWDs. (T-1). 1.1.2.2.  Account for, determine requirements, control records, budget for, price, catalog and perform other related inventory management responsibilities. (T-1). 1.1.2.3.  Maintain custody and care for MWDs under direct control of the 341 TRS. (T-1). 1.1.2.4.  Maintain  appropriate  levels  of  dog  supplies  and  equipment,  such  as  dog  gear, shipping  crates  and  food  to  support  the  kennel  population,  as  well  as  perform  other support requirements. (T-1). 1.1.2.5.  Receive,  determine  authorization-based  equitable  distribution,  issue  and  make arrangements for shipment  of dogs from  the 341  TRS to  using agencies by  commercial and military air transportation. (T-1). 1.1.2.6.  Provide  disposition  instructions  to  DoD  components  worldwide  for  the  return, redistribution or other disposition of excess dogs. (T-1). 1.1.2.7.  Maintain central repository for all retired, adopted or deceased DoD dog records. (T-0). 1.1.2.8.  Ensure,  through  veterinary  support,  newly  acquired  dogs  meet  health  and physical  standards  and  ensure  proper  nutritional,  kenneling  and  sanitary  needs  are  met. (T-1). 1.1.3.  The Air Force through AFIMSC PSU (AFSFC), Army, Navy and Marine Corps will: 1.1.3.1.  Establish a central point of contact or clearing unit to submit MWD procurement and replacement requirements to the 341 TRS. 1.1.3.2.  Monitor and approve subordinate activities’ MWD requirements. 1.1.3.3.  Budget and fund support equipment or supplies, as required.  6 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 1.1.3.4.  Report excess or overage trained MWDs as indicated in paragraph 2.9. 1.1.3.5.  Program Managers maintain a current prioritized list of MWD shortages by base. This  list  will be utilized when the Service point-of-contact  responds  to the 341 TRS on inquiries concerning distribution of available qualified MWD’s. 1.1.3.6.  Program  Managers  identify  minimum  monthly/weekly/work-cycle  substance detection utilization and proficiency training standards for service certified MWDs within individual service guidance. 1.2.  Annual  Trained  Dog  Requirements  (TDR).  The  Joint  Services  Military  Working  Dog Committee  (JSMWDC)  determines  annual  MWD  requirements  through  the  Trained  Dog Requirements (TDR) process. The JSMWDC will convene a meeting in the third quarter of each fiscal year to confirm the TDR for the three years following the coming FY and identify any out-of-cycle  requirements.  The  steady-state  TDR  is  the  required  MWD  production  number  to maintain  an  acceptable  percentage  of  Service-validated  requirements.  MWD  requirements  are independent  of  student  training  quotas  placed  on  the  341  TRS.  Each  Service’s  TDR  may  be reduced based on dog training manpower commitment shortfalls throughout the FY. 1.2.1.  Service  Initiated  Revision  of  TDR.  Service  MWD  program  managers  (PM)  can request an out-of-cycle increase in existing MWDs that will result in a revised service TDR for the current four year plan. Requests should be directed in writing to the DoD MWD PM stating  reasons  for  the  TDR  revision.  Requests  are  reviewed  on  a  case  by  case  basis; however, these are kept  to a minimum and used only to support unexpected urgent mission changes. (T-1). 1.2.2.  341  TRS  Initiated  Adjustment  of  TDR.  Based  on  historical  MWD  training  data,  the EA  shall  compute  the  projected  341  TRS  MWD  Training  Section  requirement  six  months prior to  the beginning of each  FY and in  turn, forecast  the manpower  requirement for each service based on the agreed TDR. The service manning level established at the beginning of the FY will be the basis for computing manpower shortfalls during the remainder of the FY. The 341 TRS may adjust each Service's TDR based on semi-annual reviews of each service's manpower allocation.  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 7 Chapter 2 INSTRUCTIONS, PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR MWD PROCUREMENT AND MANAGEMENT 2.1.  Requisitioning  MWDs.  Requisitions  for  MWDs  are  independent  of  student  training quotas. Requisitions are filled on an equitable distribution basis. Each Service has a set number of  MWDs  they  receive  each  year  based  on  the  steady-state  TDR.  The  Service’s  MWD  PM should distribute the MWDs to their units as needed. 2.1.1.  Requests for initial or increase in existing MWD authorization(s) should be forwarded by  the  Service  MWD  PM  to  the  DoD  MWD  PM  stating  where  (by  installation/fleet command)  each  new  authorization  should  be  applied.  The  installation/fleet  command  will need  to  send  a  brief  explanation  of  mission  change  or  reason  for  MWD  request  and appropriate  documentation  (Service  validation  letter,  etc.)  to  the  service  MWD  PM.  (T-0). Service MWD PMs will validate the request against manpower authorizations. (T-0). Funded manpower  position(s)  or  billet(s)  should  be  in  place  90  days  after  the  date  the  increase  is submitted.  If  the  request  cannot  be  validated  or  does  not  meet  manpower  criteria,  new authorization  increases  are  not  recognized  and  requisition(s)  not  entered.  It  is  the responsibility  of  the  Service  MWD  PM  to  validate  all  authorization  increases  using  these criteria. A memorandum, signed by the first O-6 or civilian equivalent in the Service MWD PM’s  chain  of  command,  stating  all  requirements  of  this  paragraph  have  been  met,  must accompany each request for authorization increase. (T-0). 2.1.2.  Each  Service  MWD  PM  should  publish  instructions  relating  to  the  establishment, validation and adjustment of MWD authorizations on military bases. The Service MWD PM will request TDR revisions IAW para. 1.2.1. (T-0). 2.1.3.  Service  PM’s  will  ensure  MWDs  are  used  as  long  as  they  are  physically  and temperamentally fit to perform their duties. Service PMs will not identify MWDs as excess to requirements on the basis of age alone. (T-1). 2.2.  Shipping/Transportation  of  MWDs.  MWDs  are  shipped  according  to  Defense  Travel Regulation  (DTR)  4500.9-R,  Part  I;  Passenger  Movement;  DTR,  Part  II,  Cargo  Routing  and Movement,  and  Air  Mobility  Command  Instruction  (AMCI)  24-101,  Vol.  11,  Cargo  and  Mail, also  applies.  PMs  must  coordinate  all  MWD  transportation  to  JBSA-Lackland,  TX  for  the purpose  of  returning  MWD  to  the  341  TRS,  with  the  341  TRS  Logistics  Flight  Freight  Rate Specialist at (MWDTransportation@us.af.mil). (T-2). 2.2.1.  MWDs shipped Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), from or to JBSA-Lackland, must be escorted by a person who has successfully completed a recognized DoD MWD  handler  course.  (T-2).  If  an  escort  from  JBSA-Lackland  is  not  available,  the appropriate  Service  MWD  PM  is  notified  and  will  be  responsible  for  providing  a  qualified escort  (at  requesting  service’s  expense)  within  15  days  of  notification  that  a  MWD  is available. (T-3). 2.2.2.  MWDs  shipped  within  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS),  may  be  shipped  by commercial air without an escort; however, situations may dictate an escort is required at the discretion  of  the  341  TRS  (i.e.,  live  animal  embargo  due  to  weather,  etc.).  Handler  escorts should have sufficient  funds to defray the cost of reimbursable variations authorized MWD  8 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 expense  as  excess  baggage  and  possible  pet  fees  per  the  Joint  Travel  Regulations  (JTR), Appendix  G.  Handler  escorts  will  be  provided,  with  all  initially  trained  MWDs  shipped against  requisitions,  the  applicable  DD  Form  1834,  Military  Working  Dog  Service  Record and an AF Form 2110A, Health Record. (T-3). 2.2.3.  MWD  shipments  are  closely  monitored  by  all  personnel  involved  to  ensure compliance  with  rules  and  regulations  of  carriers  governing  classifications  and  tariffs. Personnel must ensure proper safety and comfort standards are maintained at all times. (T-3). 2.2.4.  Shipper  will  pay  costs  for  MWD  when  shipped  as  freight.  (T-3).  When  a  MWD travels with a handler, the MWD is ticketed as (Excess Baggage) per the JTR, Appendix G, and charged to  the traveler’s fund cite using Controlled Spending  Accounts  or  Individually Billed Accounts. 2.3.  Procuring  MWDs.  The  341  TRS  is  the  only  agency  authorized  to  procure  and  distribute MWDs for use by DoD components or other agencies participating in the DoD MWD Program, unless written authorization is provided by the DoD MWD program management office and the Veterinarian  Corps,  to  the  requester’s  Service  MWD  PM.  Pre-screened  dogs  who  meet qualification  standards  are  obtained  through  procurement  (MWDProcurement@us.af.mil)  or donation to the 341 TRS from United States and foreign country sources. The DoD MWD PM should authorize any deviation to policy, in writing. 2.3.1.  DoD  components  may  be  requested  to  support  the  341  TRS  by  providing  temporary kenneling facilities, veterinary and logistics support for MWD acquisition campaigns. 2.3.2.  Military  veterinarians  are  responsible  for  performing  physical  examinations  on  all prospective MWDs to determine if they are medically suitable for the DoD MWD Program. 2.3.3.  When a dog is accepted as Government property, it is assigned a tattoo number, which is  placed on the underside of the left  ear. Tattoo numbers should not  be issued, changed or reassigned by any service/agency other than the 341 TRS. 2.4.  DoD  Owned/Contract  Supported  Working  Dogs.  The  use  of  Contract  supported Working Dogs that are procured and trained for a specific service mission will be considered as MWD’s  for  operational  standards,  care,  and  housing.  The  associated  team  support  should  be restricted  to  those  situations  in  which  the  DoD  MWD  pipeline  is  unable  to  meet  operational demands,  and  such  use  is  deemed  essential  for  exigent  mission  accomplishment  in  terms  of numbers  of  dogs  and  duration  of  use.  Such  use  of  contractor  support  should  be  requested  and coordinated  in  advance  through  the  DoD  MWD  program  management  office  and  the Veterinarian Corps, by the requester’s Service MWD PM. The scope of these programs should be limited to a last resort, utilized as a solution for emerging requirements identified by  service branches. 2.4.1.  Contract  coordination  should  be  conducted  by  a  panel  consisting  of  the  DoD  MWD program  management  office,  and  the  Director,  LTC  Daniel  E.  Holland  Military  Working Dog Hospital. The panel will confer with the JSMWDC members for lessons learned in past contract efforts. This panel reviews all aspects of the proposed contract, and the DoD MWD PM will provide comments to the servicing program manager within seven work days of the request. (T-0).  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 9 2.4.2.  If the 341 TRS cannot meet the Service MWD requirement and contractor support in procurement  is  utilized,  the  requester  should  coordinate  with  the  Director,  Department  of Defense Veterinary Service Activity  (DODVSA) to  determine if  DoD veterinary support is authorized and available. If such support is available, ensure the contract includes provisions stipulating  the  contractor  will  fully  reimburse  the  government  for  all  costs  associated  with provision of veterinary care. (T-0). If DoD veterinary support is not available, the contractor will  be  solely  responsible  for  veterinary  availability  and  care  of  its  dogs,  and  the  contract should stipulate this fact. (T-0). 2.4.3.  Contract Working Dog (CWD) teams that are contracted as a service and not owned by  the  DoD  are  not  normally  eligible  for  military  veterinary  services.  If  applicable,  and included  in  the  provisions  of  the  contract,  non-emergency  veterinary  services  may  be provided  to  CWDs,  within  the  capabilities  of  the  deployed  veterinary  unit  in  the  theater  of operations, on a reimbursable and space available basis. Upon termination of these contracts, the DoD is not responsible for the disposition and adoption of contractor owned CWDs. 2.4.4.  Emergency  veterinary  procedures  required  to  prevent  undue  suffering  or  to  save  the life or limb of CWDs may be provided by military veterinarians, on a reimbursable basis, as time and resources permit, before referral of such cases to a civilian practitioner for follow-up care. 2.4.5.  Payment  for  civilian  veterinary  medical  care  (emergency  and  non-emergency)  of CWDs in the theater of operations remains the responsibility of the contractor. 2.4.6.  Contract statement of work (SOW) should require dogs or dog teams to be certified or validated  at  the  frequency  and  task  performance  standards  as  established  by  the  using Service’s component directive for DoD MWDs. 2.4.7.  Although  CWDs  are  to  meet  or  exceed  established  Service  component  performance standards  for  MWDs,  they  should  only  be  classified  as  or  referred  to  as  MWDs  when procured/owned by the DoD. 2.4.8.  Service  branches  responsible  for  CWD  programs  or  contracts  being  executed  to augment their MWD program will address disposition and retirement events within the CWD contracts or individual service policies, to ensure the contractor provides proper care for the dogs. 2.4.8.1.  Upon  contract  termination,  all  Contract  Supported  Working  Dogs  procured/ owned  by  the  DoD  will  be  absorbed  into  the  DoD  MWD  program  within  the  owning service  first,  and  when  feasible,  the  dogs  will  be  distributed/transferred  as  MWDs  to other service branches according to current fair share standards or as operational demands dictate.  When  a  DoD  procured/owned,  contractor  trained  MWD  is  deemed  excess,  they will  be  processed  for  adoption  from  341  TRS  or  the  closest  DoD  Installation  MWD Kennel  per  established  DoD  standards  as  outlined  within  this  instruction  and  its attachments. 2.4.9.  The  341  TRS,  DoD  Dog  Training  Center,  through  the  Executive  Agent  may  not exercise adoption or disposition responsibility of special program canines, if not required by individual  Services.  The  service  responsible  for  the  contract  will  be  responsible  for disposition of the canines.  10 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 2.5.  Accountability.  The 341 TRS assumes accountability for all dogs accepted as DoD MWD Program  dogs.  The  341  TRS  Inventory  Manager  maintains  accountable  records  on  all classifications of MWDs by a Capability Code Number (CCN). Accountability transfers from the 341  TRS  to  the  gaining  installation/fleet  command  upon  receipt  of  the  MWD.  Service  MWD PMs may redistribute their MWDs within their installations/fleet commands with notification to the  341  TRS.  Redistribution  to  another  service  requires  Service  MWD  PM’s  approval  and notification  of  redistribution  in  writing,  to  the  341  TRS.  Written  notification  to  the  341  TRS Inventory  Manager,  1239  Knight  Street,  JBSA-Lackland,  TX  78236-5151,  is  made  within  15 days after transfer. 2.5.1.  MWDs should be distributed from the 341 TRS to the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force  and  Transportation  Security  Administration  (TSA)  at  no  cost  to  the  gaining service/agency with the exception of second destination transportation costs. 2.5.2.  Operational  costs such as food, medical,  transportation and other expenses related to the kenneling and welfare of MWDs are considered common Service costs. When a shipment requires  an  escort/handler,  the  receiving  Service  should  provide  funding  for  the  MWD shipment and the escort. Dogs supplied to other Federal or governmental agencies should be shipped  on  a  reimbursable  basis  according  to  agreements  between  supplying  and  receiving activities. 2.5.3.  Adopted, transferred or deceased MWDs should be removed from accountable records of  the  owning  installation/fleet  command  according  to  appropriate  materiel  management directives, within 15 days of adoption, transfer or death (includes euthanasia). A copy of the MWDs original DD Form 1834, (Service Record), with the final disposition and date boxes annotated and when adopted by a former handler indicate in the remarks section; Covenant Not to Sue; or DD Form 1743 (Death Certificate), will be provided to the 341 TRS. A copy of  DD  Form  1834  and/or  DD  Form  1743  should  be  maintained  and  forwarded  to  the  341 TRS/DOL  Central  Repository,  1239  Knight  Street,  JBSA-Lackland,  TX,  78236-5151  for retention. In the event of death, a copy of the DD Form 1743 may be faxed or emailed to the 341 TRS/DOL Central Repository, 1239 Knight Street, JBSA-Lackland, TX, 78236-5151 for retention.  In  the  case  of  an  adoption  or  transfer,  a  copy  of  the  “Covenant  not  to  Sue  with Indemnity  Agreement”  (Attachment  7,  Adoptions,  and  Attachment  8,  Law  Enforcement) should  be  faxed  or  emailed  to  the  341  TRS  for  retention  by  the  adoption/disposition coordinator, to  AFI  48-131,  AR  40-905, SECNAVINST 6401.1B, Veterinary Health Services, for regulatory guidance for disposition of medical records.) (MWD.Disposition@us.af.mil). (Refer 2.6.  Nomenclatures  and  National  Stock  Numbers  (NSN).  MWDs  are  sensitive  high  value assets with assigned NSNs to identify capabilities; however they are not referred to as equipment since  they  require  continuous  training  to  maintain  that  capability.  The  exception  to  this terminology is use of MWDs in support of civilian law enforcement as defined in DoDI 3025.21, Defense  Support  of  Civilian  Law  Enforcement  Agencies,  and  10  United  States  Code  (USC) sections  372,  374.  All  MWDs  have  a  tattoo  and  chip  identification  number  much  like  military personnel  have  a  social  security  number;  the  MWD  identification  number  is  used  to  track  and account for MWDs. MWD Nomenclatures and NSNs are: 2.6.1.  Patrol Dog (PD), 8820-00-435-9005 2.6.2.  Patrol/Drug Detector Dog (P/DDD), 8820-00-243-7542  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 11 2.6.3.

Working  Dog  Management  System  (WDMS)  is  the accepted  DoD  program  management  computer  system  for  MWDs  at  all  units.  The  program manager  for  WDMS  is  the  DoD  MWD  PM  assigned  at  AF/A4S.  DoD  components  should maintain accurate data in WDMS so reports can be retrieved from the system. 2.8.1.  The WDMS manages the full lifecycle of a MWD. This information is fully integrated within WDMS, capturing all data on when MWDs are procured, trained, and then assigned into active service in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. The system provides a  12 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 critical  function by  enabling Service PMs  to  have a  comprehensive view of the operational readiness of all MWDs and their handlers across the Service’s MWD programs. The system is employed at all units with MWDs supporting over 1,800 users. 2.8.2.  The  WDMS  Configuration  Manager  is  responsible  for  maintaining  configuration control  of  WDMS.  The  Configuration  Control  Board  (CCB)  is  the  official  body  for  final review  and  documentation  of  changes  to  the  established  WDMS  baseline.  Only  the  CCB Chairperson,  or  designated  representative,  has  the  authority  to  approve  or  disapprove  the actions  of  the  CCB.  Functional  users  are  persons  authorized  to  log-on  to  resources  on WDMS. When logging-on to resources on WDMS, every functional user must comply with WDMS  security  policies  and  procedures  outlined  in  CJCSI  6510.0  IE  as  well  as  report security incidents to the Information Assurance Officer. (T-0). 2.8.3.  Users  are  given  access  to  the  WDMS  based  on  a  need  to  perform  specific  work. Access  to  WDMS  is  granted  by  local  System  Administrators.  Assigned  users  shall  access only  the  data,  control  information,  software,  hardware,  and  firmware  for  which  they  are authorized access  and have a need-to-know,  and assume only those roles and privileges for which  they  are  authorized.  (T-0).  Users  shall  not  divulge  account  access  procedures  to  any unauthorized user. (T-0). All WDMS  users must have an  approved  DD Form 2875,  System Authorization Access Request (SAAR) and signed WDMS System Rules of Behavior on file with  their  MWD  PM  prior  to  being  approved  access  for  to  WDMS.  (T-0).  A  copy  of  the WDMS is site https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfod-mwdoffice.html. the  web System of Behavior Rules located at 2.8.4.  A  WDMS  standard  user  is  any  individual  who  has  an  account  which  does  not  have elevated  permissions  (ex:  a  dog  handler).  A  Functional  System  Administrator  (FSA)  is  any individual  with  elevated  WDMS  permissions  (ex:  a  Kennel  Master,  a  MAJCOM/Regional Representative (Rep), a Service PM Rep or a DoD Rep. In the event a standard user or a FSA temporarily  (ex:  a  security  violation  that  is  being  reviewed,  a  supervisor  decision,  or  a Commander decision) or permanently (ex: a PCS, retirement, a Commanders decision, etc.) should  no  longer  have  access  to  the  system,  it  is  the  responsibility  of  a  FSA  to  ensure  the users  access  is  removed  within  48  hours  of  the  event.  Any  unit  with  personnel  who  access WDMS,  is  required  to  have  an  action  within  their  units  out  processing  procedures  (service variations: Change of Station or Separation Checklist) to remove a departing users access to WDMS. 2.9.  Redistribution  and  Reporting  of  an  Overage  of  Trained  MWDs.  Only  the  341  TRS should  authorize  return  of  an  MWD  to  the  341  TRS.  Trained  MWDs  over  and  above  the requirements of a unit are reported to the appropriate MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet Command (Cmd), who should determine if there is a need for the MWD within that command. If the MWD is an overage to the command, it should be reported to the appropriate Service MWD PM for possible redistribution within that service. If the Service MWD PM determines the MWD is an overage, a letter should be sent to the 341 TRS requesting assistance in redistributing the MWD to another service/agency. 2.9.1.  The overage letter should contain the following information: 2.9.1.1.  Reason  MWD  declared  overage reduced authorization,  etc.)  to  include  a  statement  that  no  requirement  exists  (include (such  as  unit  deactivation,  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 13 endorsements  declaring  the  MWD  excess  to  the  MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet  Cmd  and Service MWD PM). 2.9.1.2.  Name, tattoo number and NSN. 2.9.1.3.  Age and length of service. 2.9.1.4.  Statement regarding MWD temperament and qualification status. 2.9.2.  If  the  MWD  is  approved  for  return  to  the  341  TRS,  the  MWD  is  dropped  from  the owning  unit/activity’s  account  upon  acceptance  at  the  341  TRS.  If  instructions  authorize redistribution directly to another DoD Component, accountability should be dropped by the shipping  unit/activity  and  assumed  by  the  gaining  unit/activity  on  transfer  of  the  MWD. Additionally, the transfer should be indicated in the accountability documents referred to in para 2.5. 2.9.3.  When a MWD is  approved for return to the 341 TRS, shipments are made using the losing service’s fund cite. When an MWD is approved for transfer (either within the service or to another service), shipments are made using the gaining unit/agency's funds cite. 2.10.  MWDs that fail initial field evaluation.  Upon arrival at the MWD’s initial assignment, the gaining unit is to conduct all of the MWD transition activity and initial evaluations IAW the "Qualified  MWD  Field  Transition  and  Evaluation  Guide"  distributed  by  the  341  TRS.  The purpose  of  this  process  is  to  determine  if  the  MWD  can  successfully  operate  in  the  field environment and perform at the level as certified on upon leaving the 341 TRS. If the MWD is unfit  or  unable  to  successfully  pass  the  gaining  unit's  initial  field  evaluation,  the  following: action applies: 2.10.1.  If  the  MWD  has  a  medical  disqualifier,  obtain  a  statement  from  the  attending veterinarian supporting that the MWDs physical condition has a bearing on the failure. 2.10.2.  If  the  MWD  has  a  skill  performance  issue,  document  the  apparent  deficiency.  All MWD  team  familiarization,  training  and  qualification  activity  will  be  recorded  in  WDMS. All  initial  qualification  evaluations  at  the  owning  unit  are  to  be  based  on  the  MWD performance levels during evaluation at the time of transfer from the 341 TRS as described in the “Qualified MWD Field Transition and Evaluation Guide". 2.10.3.  By  the  75th  calendar  day  after  arrival  at  the  owning  unit,  the  kennel  master  is  to complete  the  MWD  Field  Questionnaire  (FEQ)  located  in  the  WDMS.  The  MWD performance  is  documented  as  to  whether  the  MWD  meets  the  standard  or  there  are deficiencies  identified  based  off  the  "Qualified  MWD  Field  Transition  and  Evaluation Guide".  In  cases  where  deficiencies  are  noted,  the  kennel  master  should  explain  the deficiency in the comments section. If additional assistance is required from the Service PM and/or the 341TRS; contact should be made IAW service program directives. 2.10.4.  If an MWD successfully completes initial evaluation but displays performance issues during  the  gaining  unit's  subsequent  advanced  MWD  training  (i.e.  new  odor  imprinting, buried aid detection, etc.) and detection validation, the Service PM shall contact the 341 TRS for  assistance.  After  120  calendar  days  in  the  field,  an  MWD  with  performance  issues  will not  be  considered  for  return/exchange  unless  the  341  TRS  was  previously  notified  of  the situation  by  the  Service  PM.  MWDs  returned  prior  to  the  120  day  deadline  will  not  be  14 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 counted  as  a  qualified  delivery  on  the  Service's  TDR  and  the  Service  will  receive  another MWD IAW para. 1.2. to package 2.10.5.  As  directed  by  the  341  TRS,  the  Service  PM  should  forward  a  complete documentation to (341TRS.Evaluations@us.af.mil),  or  the  341  TRS/DOQE,  1220  Truemper  Street,  Suite  2, JBSA-Lackland,  TX,  78236-5151.  This  package  should  include  complete  copies  of  all training  and  utilization  records  as  generated  from  WDMS  in  addition  to  any  clarification deemed  necessary  utilizing  the  https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/Default.aspx  web page. point of contact the 341 TRS at 2.10.6.  After review of the documentation package, the 341 TRS advises the service to either continue  retraining  efforts  per  the  specific  guidance  given,  or  process  the  MWD  for disposition IAW the instructions provided. 2.11.  Euthanasia.  On the authority of the Accountable Unit Commander (AUC) or designated representative,  MWDs  may  be  euthanized  after  consultation  with  the  attending  military veterinarian.  With  the  exception  of  medical  conditions  that  warrant  emergent  euthanasia, attending  military  veterinarians  must  consult  with  military  specialists  at  the  DoD  MWD Veterinary  Service  (DoD  MWD  VS),  JBSA-Lackland,  TX.  (T-0).  When  an  MWD  is experiencing undue suffering with a poor prognosis for return to duty, the attending veterinarian is authorized to euthanize the MWD without prior consultation with DoD MWD VS personnel. Euthanasia  is  in  accordance  with  acceptable  standards  as  outlined  in  the  American  Veterinary Medical  Association’s  Council  on  Euthanasia.  Anytime  a  MWD  is  euthanized,  the  attending veterinarian must complete and submit a DD Form 1743, listing the reason for euthanasia, to the DoD MWD VS and provide a copy of this form to the unit commander to allow requisition of a replacement MWD. (T-0). 2.11.1.  An MWD may be euthanized under the following circumstances: 2.11.1.1.  To  terminate  suffering  caused  by  disease,  injury  or  permanent  physical disability. 2.11.1.2.  To prevent the spread of contagious disease. 2.11.1.3.  When  unable  to  perform  as  the  result  of  an  incurable  disease  or  physical disability. 2.11.1.4.  When  behavioral  disorders  are  diagnosed  that  are  not  responsive  to  humane training therapy designed to return the MWD to normal use. 2.11.2.  When  other  conditions  exist  which  may  warrant  euthanasia,  such  as  viciousness  or behavioral  instability,  the  unit  and  the  attending  veterinarian  must  consult  with  the  DoD MWD VS before euthanasia is authorized. (T-0). 2.11.3.  If  MWD  is  in  a  deployed  location,  remains  may  be  hand-carried  or  shipped  by United  States  Postal  Service  (USPS).  Ensure  they  are  in  a  non-metal,  sift-proof  container such as double bagged and in  a  cardboard box.  If shipped, handlers need to  identify on the customs label as cremated remains. 2.12.  Disposition of Trained, Failure to Qualify and Medically Eliminated MWDs.  MWDs are deemed excess to the needs of the DoD, by the 341 TRS, before they are disposed of by any DoD  component  or  participating  federal  agency  through  sale,  adoption,  transfer  to  Law  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 15 Enforcement or euthanasia. The disposition process established by the 341 TRS is governed by the  requirements  of  Title  10  USC  Chapter  153  Section  2583.  Once  an  owning  unit  has determined  their  MWD  can  no  longer  meet  mission  requirements,  the  unit  may  begin  the disposition  process.  The  owning  unit  will  contact  their  MWD  PM  to  identify  their  MWD  as  a possible  candidate  for  elimination  from  the  MWD  program  and  to  initiate  the  disposition process. (T-0). The owning unit will ensure no MWD procured for utilization in the DoD MWD program is disposed of by transfer to any agency (i.e., medical, research and development (R&D) or clinical  investigation) for the purpose of invasive research or training that  would potentially compromise the health of the MWD. (T-0). 2.12.1.  To initiate disposition of a MWD, the AUC, should coordinate the package through the  Service  MWD  PM  who  submits  it  to  the  341  TRS  Adoption/Disposition  coordinator utilizing  the  https://safe.amrdec.army.mil/SAFE/Default.aspx  web  page.  All  pertinent documents  involving  the  MWDs  disposition  are  scanned  and  uploaded  to  this  website  for submission. A Bite Muzzle Video (reference, Evaluation Prognosis Key, Attachment 10), is also  recorded  for  all  patrol  trained,  previously  patrol  trained,  or  any  MWD  that  displays aggressive behaviors, and uploaded using Windows Media Player, unless a safety exemption is made by local Veterinary staff. When this occurs, the attending Veterinarian must submit a letter  explaining  the  safety  reasons  the  MWD  cannot  safely  perform  the  evaluation.  (T-0). Air Force packages should  be submitted via their respective chain  of command determined by their Service MWD PM. Army packages are submitted through ACOM/ASCC/DRU, with an  information  copy  provided  to  the  Service  MWD  PM.  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  packages should  be  submitted  through  the  chain  of  command  to  the  Service  MWD  PM.  NOTE:  An Adoption Suitability Assessment and bite muzzle video is NOT required for MWDs that will only be considered for Transfer to LEA. 2.12.2.  Service  PMs  will  scan  all  disposition  packages  in  the  following  order  (see Attachment 6 for AUC checklist). (T-1). 2.12.2.1.  Kennel Master (KM) drafts a recommendation letter signed by the AUC, letter identifies a medical problem or the cause of failure and a summary of retraining efforts. (See Attachment 2) 2.12.2.2.  AFSFC/MWD PM recommendation for USAF units, Service MWD PM letter for Army, Navy and Marine Corps units. 2.12.2.3.  Bite muzzle video (for MWDs that are or, have received, bite work training, or display aggressive behaviors) is sent to regional veterinarian first for evaluation. 2.12.2.4.  Bite  muzzle  test  assessment  form  (for  MWDs  that  have  completed  the  Bite muzzle video). (See Attachment 5) 2.12.2.5.  MWD  Adoption  Suitability  Checklist  (AUC  must  indicate  if  MWD  was deemed suitable or not suitable for adoption). (T-2). (See Attachment 3) 2.12.2.6.  Training records (only if a training issue exists) consist of training records from start  of  training  issue  to  present  or  if  unit  recommends  return  to  341  TRS  as  a  training aid. 2.12.2.7.  Veterinarian letter to  AUC  (must  describe the MWDs physical  condition  as it relates to performance failure and medical eligibility for adoption). (T-1).  16 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 2.12.2.8.  Consultation/Referral Form from Veterinarian. 2.12.2.9.  DD Form 2619, Master Problem List. 2.12.2.10.  DD  Form  1829,  Record  of  Military  Working  Dog  Physical  Examination, rendered within 30 days of the report and containing a complete synopsis of the medical history. 2.12.2.11.  Relevant SF 600, Chronological Record of Medical Care. 2.12.2.12.  Relevant SF 519-B, Radiologic Consultation Request/Report. 2.12.3.  Any  change  to  required  supporting  items  or  documents  is  enumerated  on  the  341 site, TRS http://www.37trw.af.mil/units/37traininggroup/341sttrainingsquadron/index.asp, or published Disposition and Adoption Procedures Guidelines. web 2.12.4.  Following  the  review  of  the  package,  the  341  TRS  Disposition  Review  Board  will provide  a  recommendation.  (T-1).  If  the  MWD  is  deemed  excess  to  the  needs  of  the  DoD, this written recommendation is forwarded to the MAJCOM/ACOM/Navy/Marine Corps PM. 2.12.5.  The Disposition Review Board may take the following actions: 2.12.5.1.  Declared excess to the DoD. 2.12.5.2.  Direct MWD stay on duty at present location. 2.12.5.3.  Direct return of MWD to JBSA-Lackland, TX, for use in training. The unit will coordinate transportation arrangements with the 341 TRS inventory manager and freight rate specialist. (T-3). When the MWD fails to initially certify or the MWD is returned to the 341 TRS as a training aid, the 341 TRS will be responsible for the cost of returning the MWD. (T-2). The accountable unit that has a MWD will fund any transportation fees associated with a military escort of the MWD back to the United States. (T-0). 2.12.6.  When a MWD is declared excess or unsuitable for DoD use by 341 TRS and deemed by the AUC as suitable for adoption, the MWD should be disposed of to the greatest extent possible by the following priorities: (T-0). 2.12.6.1.  Adoption by a former handler should have first preference when determined to be in the best interest of the MWD or DoD owned CWDs and then other persons capable of humanely caring for the dog. It is the MWD handler’s responsibility to make adoption requests known to the KM. The KM is to annotate the “loss remarks” box in the “MWD Management”  Tab  of  WDMS  when  a  handler  has  identified  their  request  to  adopt  their MWD  upon  retirement.  In  the  event  of  multiple  handlers  desiring  to  adopt  a  retiring MWD, the AUC will determine the adopter in the best interest of the MWD and the KM will inform all handlers of the decision. See Attachment 9 for the MWD Adoption Form that should be completed by candidate adopter and maintained by the AUC or designee. 2.12.6.2.  Transfer  to  a  Law  Enforcement  Agency  (LEA).  MWDs  that  have  not successfully completed training or operational MWDs that are considered too aggressive for adoption by private citizen or a handler should be considered for transfer, if otherwise healthy.  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 17 2.12.6.3.  Humane euthanasia by VCO supporting the AUC when not disposed of under above methods.  Euthanasia should only  be used  as a last  resort when all  other methods have been exhausted. 2.12.7.  The appropriate “Covenant not to Sue with Indemnity Agreement” in Attachments 7 and  8  is  completed  for  both  an  (adoption,  private  citizen)  and  a  (transfer,  Law Enforcement/Government agency). 2.12.8.  Veterinary Corps Officer (VCO) will neuter or spay all MWDs prior to adoption, but this can be waived for transfer to Law Enforcement/Government agency. (T-1). 2.12.9.  Adoptions/transfers take place at the kennels where the MWD is declared excess and the DoD cannot incur transportation costs for adoptions. The VCO and the 341 TRS/CC or designee  will  give  prior  approval  before  any  MWDs  who  are  suitable  for  adoption,  law enforcement transfer or euthanasia can be returned to the 341 TRS. (T-1). 2.12.10.  MWDs can be recognized by the AUC as providing exceptional service for specific incidents  or  summation  during  transfer  or  adoption.  For  an  alterable  example  of  the  MWD Certificate to  https://afsfmil.lackland.af.mil/sfod-mwdoffice.html. of  Meritorious  Service go 2.12.11.  The  bite  muzzle  evaluation  and  video  are  routed  to  their  respective  Regional Veterinarian  for  behavioral  evaluation.  In  unique  cases  where  a  determination  cannot  be made,  the  Animal  Behavior  Specialist  assigned  to  the  LTC  Daniel  E.  Holland  Military Working  Dog  Hospital  at  JBSA-Lackland  TX  will  provide  necessary  input  for  evaluation. (T-2). All Regional Veterinarians conducting adoption suitability evaluations must be trained by the Animal Behavior Specialist. (T-2). The only exceptions to the bite muzzle evaluation are: 2.12.11.1.  The MWD is  a danger to  itself and/or others (these records have a  Behavior Consult  in  them  with  a  "DO  NOT  ADOPT"  statement,  concurring  with  the  VCO's decision to humanely euthanize the MWD). 2.12.11.2.  Completing the video would severely compromise the MWDs welfare (severe injury/disease/pain;  these  records  also  contain  a  Behavior  Consult  supporting  this decision and providing a working prognosis if the MWD is otherwise adoptable). 2.12.11.3.  When a MWD poses an immediate threat to kennel staff or is suffering due to an incurable medical illness the local Veterinarian may euthanize the MWD. 2.13.  Local  Training  of  Qualified  Patrol  MWDs.  With  MAJCOM/ACOM/Fleet  Cmd approval, units may locally train single purpose detector dogs that have received training by the 341 TRS in explosives or drugs as patrol/detector dogs. Units will contact the 341 TRS/DOQE for  training  protocol  prior  to  initiating  training.  (T-2).  Once  local  training  is  completed,  the MWD is initially certified. The 341 TRS/DOQE (or personnel authorized in writing by the 341 TRS/CC) must certify locally trained explosive detector dogs as well as patrol dogs. (T-2). The requesting unit pays for associated TDY expenses unless other arrangements are made with 341 TRS.  Non-341  TRS  patrol  MWD  evaluators  will  conduct  patrol  certification  evaluations  using the 341 TRS Operating Instruction (OI) patrol certification protocols. (T-2). 341 TRS evaluators will assist with consultation about those standards and their application, and provide the OI and evaluation forms. (T-2).  18 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 2.13.1.  Following  a  successful  patrol  MWD  certification,  non-341  TRS  patrol  MWD evaluators  should  transmit  copies  of  completed  and  signed  JBSA-Lackland  Form  375  for each certified MWD to their MWD program manager, who should execute a cover letter and forward this letter along with any other required documentation to 341 TRS Evaluations. 341 TRS  Evaluations  forwards  these  copies,  along  with  letters  requesting  appropriate  NSN changes, for approval by the commander and for action by the Logistics Flight. 2.14.  Inquiries  Concerning  Procurement.  Persons  offering  dogs  for  sale  or  donation  to  the Government should contact 341 TRS/DOLMP, 1239 Knight Street, JBSA-Lackland, TX 78236-5151, DSN 473-5895, or toll free 1-800-531-1066 or via (MWDProcurement@us.af.mil). 2.15.  Deployment Categories and Deployment Medical Procedures for MWDs.  MWDs are frequently deployed to austere environments with high operational tempos and limited veterinary care.  Consequently,  it  is  important  that  all  VCOs  and  KMs  continually  evaluate  and  prepare MWDs in a consistent manner to meet medical readiness requirements. This ensures the MWD arrives fit for duty. 2.15.1.  IAW  AR  40-905/SECNAVINST  6401.1B/AFI  48-131  and  AR  40-3,  it  is  the  joint responsibility of the VCO and the KM to meet no less than quarterly to discuss the medical condition,  training  proficiency  and  physical  fitness  status  of  each  MWD.  VCOs  advise  and support KMs and MWD unit commanders on MWD medical issues affecting readiness and fitness for duty. 2.15.2.  MWDs are assigned a deployment category as defined herein by the attending VCO in  consultation  with  the  KM.  This  deployment  categorization  serves  as  a  valuable management tool to define current medical readiness for each MWD, and is intended for use by KMs, unit commanders and service MWD program  managers to  apportion  MWD assets based  upon  medical  readiness  and  fitness  for  duty.  Only  the  attending  VCO  assigns  the deployment  category.  VCOs  should  ensure  that  the  medical  deployment  categories  of  all MWDs are updated at least monthly, at every routine exam or sick call, or any time a medical condition  develops  that  warrants  a  change  in  the  deployment  category.  VCOs  should  also ensure  this  information  is  concurrently  documented  in  the  Health  Record  (HR),  updated  in the WDMS database and provided to the KM and MWD unit commander. 2.15.3.  Deployment categories for MWDs are as follows: 2.15.3.1.  CATEGORY 1, Unrestricted Deployment. 2.15.3.1.1.  Medically fit for any contingency or exercise. 2.15.3.1.2.  No limiting or compromising factors (lack of stamina, etc.). 2.15.3.1.3.  No  existing  or  recurring  medical  problems  that  limit  performance. Chronic or minor medical problems may exist or be under treatment but do not limit performance.  Medications  or  special  diets  are  not  considered  limiting  factors  unless unavailable. 2.15.3.2.  CATEGORY 2, Restricted Deployment. 2.15.3.2.1.  Medically  fit  for  regions  or  missions  after  consideration  of  known medical problems and consultation with KM. 2.15.3.2.2.  No significant limiting or compromising factors.  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 19 2.15.3.2.3.  Medical  problems  may  exist  which  slightly  limit  performance  but  are controlled. 2.15.3.2.4.  Reason  for  restriction  is  reported  in  the  HR  and  to  the  KM,  MWD  unit commander and service MWD PMs. 2.15.3.3.  CATEGORY 3, Temporarily Non-deployable. 2.15.3.3.1.  Medical  condition  exists  that  impedes  daily  duty  performance  and  is under diagnosis, observation or treatment. 2.15.3.3.2.  Reason for non-deployability is reported in the HR and to the KM, MWD unit commander and Service MWD PMs. 2.15.3.3.3.  An Estimated Release Date (ERD) is reported in the HR and to the KM, MWD unit commander and service MWD PMs. A MWD in CATEGORY 3 requires periodic  follow-up  exams,  further  consultation  with  Veterinary  Corps  Clinical Specialists  and  consistent  reevaluation  of  the  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  plan  for return to duty. 2.15.3.4.  CATEGORY 4, Non-deployable. 2.15.3.4.1.  Unresolved  medical  or  physical  problems  exist  that  frequently  or regularly impede daily duty performance and ERD cannot be given. 2.15.3.4.2.  Medical  or  physical  conditions  warrant  submission  to  the  MWD Disposition  Process  with  subsequent  replacement  within  one  year.  CATEGORY  4 MWDs  are  specifically  authorized  for  limited  missions  on  their  installation,  within their  medical  condition  and  training  proficiency  capabilities  at  the  discretion  of  the KM and MWD unit commander. 2.15.3.4.3.  Reason for non-deployability is reported in the HR and to the KM, MWD unit commander and PMs. 2.15.4.  Pre-deployment medical procedures are as follows: 2.15.4.1.  Generally,  MWDs  are  in  CATEGORY  1or  2  status  to  be  eligible  for deployment  OCONUS  or  outside  their  home  theater  of  operation.  For  all  MWD deployments,  however,  the  final  deployment  authority  resides  with  the  MWD  unit commander. 2.15.4.2.  VCOs  will  refer  to  deployment  medical  intelligence  assets  before  deployment to  determine  any  specific  medical  requirements.  (T-2).  This  information  is  conveyed  to the  KM,  MWD  handler  and  unit  commander  to  ensure  widest  dissemination  of  this critical information. 2.15.4.3.  All  MWDs  have  a  physical  examination  and  be  current  on  all  required immunizations  prior  to  deployment  in  order  to  confirm  fitness  for  duty  and  to  issue  a health certificate. 2.15.4.4.  A  Deployment  Health  Record  (DHR)  accompanies  the  MWD  whenever  it deploys  from  its  home  station.  MWD  health  records  are  reviewed  evaluating  specific COCOM/deployment area veterinary considerations. At the time of MWD return to home station, all new forms and data are transferred into the permanent HR.  20 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 2.15.4.5.  VCOs  must  send  an  adequate  supply  of  all  chronic  and  prophylactic medications, such as heartworm and ectoparasite preventives, to last through the duration of anticipated deployment. (T-2). 2.15.4.6.  Vector-borne infections are a major concern for MWDs in most deployed areas of operation. Aggressive vector control efforts are required. All MWDs should receive a monthly  oral  heartworm  preventive  combined  with  an  intestinal  parasite  preventive  and monthly  broad-spectrum  topical  non-permethrin  non-organophosphate  acaracide  or acaracide with insect growth regulator. The attending VCO will provide these items. (T-2). 2.15.4.7.  Routine prophylaxis should be supplemented with amitraz collars and/or daily non-permethrin,  non-organophosphate  acaracide  (such  as  fipronil  spray),  if  necessary, when a MWD deploys to an area with high risk of tick-borne illness (e.g., Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia, the Balkans). 2.15.4.8.  Routine prophylaxis  should be supplemented with  a four percent  deltamethrin collar when a MWD deploys to an area with endemic or epidemic leishmaniasis and sand fly infestation (e.g., the Mediterranean basin, Southwest Asia). 2.15.4.9.  The VCO will issue a health certificate not  more than 10 days prior to  travel. (T-2). 2.15.5.  The  attending  VCO  will  instruct  the  MWD  handler  on  general  dog  care  and  any special instructions necessary for the geographic region to include the following: (T-2). 2.15.5.1.  Feed  only  the  standard  diet  to  MWDs,  and  only  the  prescribed  diet  to  other MWDs  as  directed  by  the  attending  VCO.  Ensure  proper  storage  of  MWD  diet,  with particular attention to rodent control and protection from contamination. 2.15.5.2.  Use only potable water for MWD. 2.15.5.3.  Administer  heartworm  preventive  and  external  parasite  preventive  monthly. Administer  oral  doxycycline  or  tetracycline  with  food  and  water  as  directed  by  the attending VCO. Remove medicated collars when the MWD is  not under direct  physical control in order to reduce risk of accidental ingestion and intoxication. 2.15.5.4.  Examine  MWDs  for  external  parasites  daily  and  report  any  infestation  to  the KM. 2.15.5.5.  Employ heat and cold prevention measures, as appropriate and emergency first aid treatment for heat exhaustion or hypothermia. 2.15.6.  MWD medical procedures during deployment are as follows: 2.15.6.1.  MWD handlers and KMs will watch individual MWDs for behavior and health problems, and report problems to their supporting veterinary personnel. (T-2). 2.15.6.2.  MWD  handlers,  KMs  and  theater  program  managers  must  establish  reliable communications  with  veterinary  assets  in  theater  as  soon  as  possible  to  coordinate veterinary  support,  medical  evacuation  (MEDEVAC)  and  emergency  care  policies  and procedures. (T-2).  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 21 2.15.6.3.  Because of the potential adverse effect on a MWD, use of non-approved items such as: cooling vests, pad covers, booties, ballistics vests, goggles and so forth, should be discussed with the KM and theater veterinary personnel before use. 2.15.7.  MWD medical procedures during redeployment are as follows: 2.15.7.1.  Because of the potential of introduction of foreign animal  diseases, as well as the health of the MWD, the following actions take place within 72 hours of arrival of an MWD returning from OCONUS missions: 2.15.7.2.  A  physical  examination  and  evaluation  including  submission  of  clinically appropriate  lab  tests,  update  of  permanent  HR  and  nutrition  (diet  and  weight) information. 2.15.7.3.  Treat the MWD for any external parasites and internal parasites. 2.15.7.4.  The MWD is separated from other MWDs as much as possible for 14 days. The MWD  may  continue  to  work  during  this  time  provided  it  does  not  show  any  signs  of illness.    22 AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 2.15.7.5.  Collect and submit post-deployment blood samples. 2.15.7.6.  MWDs returning to CONUS  from any region  of the world  where screwworm exists (e.g., Central  and  South  America, Cuba, Southwest  Asia) should be accompanied by  a  certificate  signed  by  the  VCO  or  a  full-time  salaried  veterinary  official  of  the exporting region stating that the dog was inspected within five days preceding shipment to  CONUS  and  was  found  to  be  either  free  of  screwworm  or  was  found  to  be  infested with  screwworm  and  was  held  in  quarantine  and  treated  until  free  prior  to  leaving  the region of export. These MWDs are re-examined at five days and 14 days after arrival at home station. JOHN B.

Background:  Bite  Muzzle  Video  (BMV)  is  accomplished  for  each  Military  Working Dog  (MWD)  with  prior  training  and/or  employment  in  controlled-aggression  that  is  being considered  for  adoption.  This  video  is  produced  by  the  owning  unit  and  evaluated  by  a veterinarian trained by the Veterinary Behaviorist at the LTC Daniel E. Holland MWD Hospital at Joint Base    San Antonio-Lackland, TX, for use by the attending veterinarian and owning unit Commander. The evaluation is accomplished as  part of a Request  for  Disposition to  determine whether  a  MWD  is  “Excess  to  Government  Needs”  (and,  therefore,  adoptable  and/or transferrable outside of the DoD). It should be noted that the “Excess” determination is based on medical,  behavioral  and/or  training  deficiencies  of  a  MWD,  but  the  decision  to  adopt  or  not adopt a MWD determined to be “Excess” is the responsibility of the owning unit Commander in accordance  with  the  guidelines  provided  in  the  below  assessment  chart.  (Public  Law  106-446, November 2000). A10.2.  Procedure:  The  Bite  Muzzle  video  is  accomplished  according  to  a  published  protocol and  forwarded  as  a  digital  video  for  evaluation.  This  video  is  evaluated  for  signs  of  overt aggression  as  well  as  canine  behavior  and  body  postures  that  are  suggestive  of  increased  or decreased potential for future aggressive behavioral problems. The video is assessed along with the  Request  for  Disposition,  Adoption  Suitability  Checklist  (ASC)  and  Veterinary  Record  to provide  an  over-all  assessment  of  liability  for  the  adoption  of  a  MWD.  The  assessment  is reported on a Medical Record Consult Sheet (SF 513) to the MWDs attending veterinarian and owning unit chain of command. The attending veterinarian provides consultation to the owning unit  commander  regarding  the  advisability  of  adopting  a  MWD,  based  on  its  medical condition(s)  and  behavior.  The  fundamental  behavioral  recommendation  is  provided  as  a “Prognosis for Successful Adoption.”  AFI31-126  28 FEBRUARY 2017 43 Figure A10.1.  Prognosis for Successful Adoption.
