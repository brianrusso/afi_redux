Purpose.  The purpose of this instruction is to identify Air Force roles and responsibilities and  provide  Air  Force  specific  procedures  for  the  identification,  investigation,  reporting,  and remediation of potential ADA violations in compliance with DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume. 14, Administrative Control of Funds and Antideficiency Act Violations. 1.2.  The  Antideficiency  Act.  The ADA is codified in Title 31, United States Code (USC), §§ 1341(a), 1342, and 1517(a). The ADA prohibits the obligating or expenditure of funds in excess or  in  advance  of  a  Congressional  appropriation  or  an  agency’s  apportionment  or  formal administrative subdivision.  ADA violations may be caused by violating statutory limitations in the use of funds as it relates to an appropriation’s purpose, period of availability, or amount. 1.3.  Administrative  Controls  Over  Funds.  The Department  of Defense (DoD) is  required to establish and operate a system of administrative controls over appropriated and non-appropriated funds  (31  USC  §  1514(a)).    DoD  controls  are  codified  in  the  DoD  FMR.  These  controls  are designed  to  regulate  the  quarterly  rate  of  obligation,  the  management  approval  levels  for obligations according to timing of individual contract actions, cumulative program dollar values, and  the  purposes  for  which  the  funds  are  used.    The  system  also  tracks  funds  availability  and often  facilitates  a  determination  of  those  individuals  responsible  for  ADA  violations.    See  the DoD FMR Volume. 14, Chapter 1, Administrative Control of Funds. 1.4.  Violation Causes.  ADA violations  can be  caused and result from a variety of actions or omissions. See the DoD FMR Volume. 14, Chapter 2, Antideficiency Act (ADA) violations for detailed information and examples. 1.5.  Reporting Suspected/Potential ADA Violations.  Military members or civilian employees  who  identify  possible  improper  uses  of  appropriated  Air  Force  funds  that  may  constitute potential ADA violations must promptly report their concerns to their organization’s comptroller.  Local  comptrollers  will  then  perform  an  initial  review  of  the  matter  as  discussed  in  Chapter  4.  (T-1).  Where  circumstances  dictate,  individuals  may  report  potential  violations  to  their  Major Command  (MAJCOM)  comptrollers  or  SAF/FMFA.    Special  Access  Programs  (SAPs)  are handled  on  a  case  by  case  basis  often  in  conjunction  with  SAF/  FMF,  SAF/FMBIB  and  the Security  Assistance  Policy  Coordinating  Office  (SAPCO),  see  paragraph  2.5.1.    In  addition, individuals may contact the DoD or Air Force Offices of the Inspector General. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   7  Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES  2.1.  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force.

The disciplinary official’s decision to administer a given level of discipline shall be  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  negotiated  agreements  applicable  to  the  responsible individual.    In  considering  appropriate  disciplinary  action,  the  disciplinary  official  will  review applicable  and  relevant  evidence  (which  generally  includes  the  ADA  Report,  underlying documentary and testimonial evidence, and the SAF/FMF determination of an ADA violation). (T-1).  Disciplinary  officials  will  consider  appropriate  disciplinary  action  in  consultation  with their Staff Judge Advocate or servicing legal office (as well as the Civilian Personnel Office, in the  case  of  a  civilian  employee).    Any  disciplinary  action  considered  appropriate,  because  of facts disclosed in the ADA investigation, must be accomplished in a timely manner. 2.13.  Legal Advisor.  Generally, the PRO or IO’s local Staff Judge Advocate will assign a legal advisor  to  support  the  IO.  (T-1)  This  local  legal  advisor  should  have  fiscal  law  experience  or training.    The  legal  advisor  will  interpret  statutes,  regulations,  and  administrative  guidance relevant  to  the  ADA  investigation  and  will  work  with  the  PRO  and  IO  throughout  the investigation.  The local legal advisor may prepare a written legal opinion before the Appointing Official’s SJA renders its legal opinion, on request of the Appointing Official’s SJA. 2.14.  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU  Staff  Judge  Advocates  (SJA).  MAJCOM,  FOA,  and  DRU SJAs  are  responsible  for  reviewing  all  preliminary  reviews  and  formal  investigations  and providing a legal opinion to the appointing official prior to a report’s submission to SAF/FMF. 2.15.  Supporting  Functional  Experts.  Additional  functional  experts  are  made  available through  the  Comptroller  or  ADA  focal  point  to  support  the  PRO  or  IO,  as  needed.      All functional  experts  that  support  the  PRO  or  IO  in  completing  their  report  must  complete  a Statement of Independence before advising the PRO or IO.  (T-1) 2.16.  Air Force Military Members and Federal Employees.  All Air Force military members and  federal  employees  must  follow  requirements  for  administrative  control  of  Air  Force  funds when  involved  in  authorizing,  incurring  or  expending  Air  Force  funds.    (T-1)  Only  authorized military members or federal employees may obligate Air Force funding. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   11  Chapter 3 SELECTING THE ADA INVESTIGATOR  3.1.  Background.  Both Preliminary Reviews (Chapter 4) and Formal Investigations (Chapter 5) require  the  appointment  of  a  qualified  investigator  or  investigation  team.      The  general qualifications,  selection,  and  responsibilities  of  these  investigators  are  set  forth  in  DoD  FMR Volume 14, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. 3.2.  Investigator  Selection.  All  Formal  IOs  and  PROs  are  appointed  by  the  Appointing Official. An Appointing Official shall initiate a preliminary review or formal ADA investigation upon receipt of written notification by SAF/FMF.  (T-0) The appointing official shall select and appoint  the  PRO  or  IO  in  writing  no  later  than  2  weeks  after  SAF/FMFA  directs  the  ADA investigation.  (T-0)    The  Appointing  Official  selects  the  investigator  from  a  roster  of  qualified individuals.   The Appointing Official is responsible for ensuring that the individuals selected are qualified and independent/impartial.  If a decision of the appointing official is the subject of an investigation  or  the  Appointing  Official  otherwise  has  a  personal  interest  in  the  subject  or outcome  of  an  investigation,  he  or  she  must  recuse  themselves  from  the  appointment  process.  (T-0) SAF/FMFA shall serve as the Appointing Official in such cases. 3.3.  Qualified  ADA  Investigator  Roster.  The  ADA  Focal  Point  develops  and  maintains  an updated  roster  of  trained  and  qualified  PROs  and  IOs.    The  roster  is  to  be  used  to  select individuals  to  investigate  potential  ADA  violations.    The  Focal  Point  maintains  a  roster  of current data including: the date of last fiscal law training, rank/grade, organization to which the PRO/IO  is  assigned,  functional  specialty,  number  of  investigations  previously  conducted,  and when the investigations were conducted. 3.3.1.  The  PRO,  or  IO,  must  have  successfully  completed  fiscal  law  training  and  have knowledge in financial management and the functional area that is involved in the potential violation.  (T-0)    The  following  is  a  suggested  list  of  courses:  the  Distance  Learning  Fiscal Law Course of the Air Force Judge Advocate General’s School, the in-residence Fiscal Law Course  of  the  Army  Judge  Advocate  General’s  School,  the  Fiscal  Law  portion  of  the  Air Force Institute of Technology’s Air Force Systems and Logistics Contracting Course, or the Fiscal  Law  Course  offered  through  the  FM  Distributed  Learning  Center.    The  ADA  Focal Point ensures that a refresher course is available, as needed, but in no event is an individual designated  to  serve  as  an  IO  more  than  three  years  after  completing  their  last  fiscal  law training course. 3.3.2.  ADA  Focal  Point  updates  the  roster  on  the  15th  of  January  and  the  15th  of  July  of every  year to ensure a sufficient number of qualified PROs and IOs remain available in the appropriate  rank/grade.    The  updated  roster  should  be  submitted  to  SAF/FMFA.    If  a sufficient  number  of  previously  qualified  PROs  or  IOs  are  not  available  to  complete  an investigation, the ADA Focal Point may provide a nominee with training, add his/her name to  the  Command  roster,  and  recommend  to  the  Appointing  Official  that  the  individual  be appointed  as  a  provisional  PRO  or  IO,  pending  completion  of  fiscal  law  training  at  the earliest practical opportunity. 3.4.  Investigator Independence.  In all matters associated with the ADA work, the investigator and/or  the  investigation  team  are  free  in  both  fact  and  appearance  from  personal,  external,  and   12  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 organization  impairments  to  independence.    The  Appointing  Official  considers  the  following when appointing a PRO or an IO. 3.4.1.  PROs and IOs may have no vested interest in the outcome of an investigation to which they are assigned. 3.4.2.  PROs  and  IOs  must  be  capable  of  conducting  a  complete,  impartial  and  unbiased investigation. 3.4.3.  To  ensure  independence,  the  Appointing  Official  will  select  the  IO  or  PRO  from  an organization  external  to  the  immediate  organization  being  investigated  (e.g.,  outside  the program office or squadron where the potential ADA violation may have occurred). (T-1) 3.4.4.  While not  mandatory, it is  suggested that  the  IO’s rank/grade be equal  to,  or  greater than, the highest-ranking individual whose actions/decisions are under review. 3.4.5.  The  Appointing  Official  should  contact  his  or  her  servicing  SJA  concerning  any independence/conflict of interest issues or questions. 3.4.6.  If no independent PROs or IOs are available, contact SAF/FMFA for assistance. 3.4.7.  Maintaining  independence  is  a  continuing  responsibility.  Investigators  at  all  levels have  a  responsibility  to  maintain  independence  so  that  their  opinions,  conclusions, judgments,  and  recommendations  are  impartial  and  viewed  as  impartial  by  knowledgeable third  parties  and  those  named  responsible  for  the  ADA  violation.    An  investigator  avoids situations  that  could  lead  reasonable  persons  with  knowledge  of  the  relevant  facts  and circumstances  to  conclude  the  investigator  is  not  capable  of  exercising  objective  and impartial judgment on all issues associated with conducting and reporting on the ADA work. investigators  and  supervisors  must  complete  an 3.5.  Independence  Statement.  The  appointing  official  is  required  to  certify  the  investigator’s independence  in  the  formal  appointment  letter.  (T-1)  Before  performing  or  assisting  an  ADA investigation, independence  statement (Attachment  15)  certifying  they  have  no  relationships  and/or  beliefs  that  might  cause  them  to limit the extent of the investigation, limit disclosure, or slant investigative findings in any way. (T-1)  Copies  of  the  independence  statement  are  retained  in  the  ADA  case  file.    The  required independence  statement  extends  to  all  investigators  and  specialists  (e.g.  civil  engineering, contracting, and legal) associated with the investigation. 3.6.  Investigator Qualifications.  When selecting an IO/PRO, the Appointing Official considers the  individual’s  experience  or  expertise  in  financial  management,  their  knowledge  of  financial management policies and procedures and the ADA, and their ability to perform an independent investigation. Additionally, the appointing official considers: 3.6.1.  Completion  of  Fiscal  Law  Training.  At  a  minimum,  all  PROs  and  IOs  will successfully complete either the Distance Learning Fiscal Law Course of the Air Force Judge Advocate General’s School, the in-residence Fiscal Law Course of the Army Judge Advocate General’s  School,  the  Fiscal  Law  portion  of  the  Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology’s  Air Force Systems and Logistics Contracting Course, or a comparable program of instruction. (T-0)  An  IO  must  have  completed  their  last  fiscal  law  training  within  3  years  of  their appointment for a formal ADA investigation. (T-0)  However, in extenuating circumstances, the Appointing Official may direct the individual selected to receive the required training and place the individual on the roster of qualified individuals before appointment. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   13  3.6.2.  Completion of Investigator Training.  The IO must have completed the Investigation Officer training within 3 years of their appointment for a formal ADA investigation. (T-0) 3.6.3.  Time  and  Availability.  The  Appointing  Official  should  select  an  IO  that  is  available for the full 12 months required to complete all phases of an ADA investigation. 3.6.4.  Functional Area Knowledge. An IO or PRO has adequate experience in the functional area that is involved in the apparent violation. 3.6.5.  Rank  and  Grade.  It  is  also  desirable,  but  not  mandatory,  that  the  investigator’s rank/grade  be  equal  to,  or  greater  than,  the  highest-ranking  individual  whose  actions  are under review. 3.7.  The  Appointment  Memorandum.  The  formal  appointment  memorandum  includes  the following (see Attachment 5 for an example): 3.7.1.  ADA case control number. 3.7.2.  Specific time frames to be met (17 weeks for the investigation). 3.7.3.  A statement noting that the  IO is  certified as properly trained and qualified.  The IO must attach a copy of their latest fiscal law and ADA Investigator training certificates to the ADA Report. (T-0) 3.7.4.  A  statement  noting  that  the  IO  is  free  of  personal,  external  and  organizational impairments.    The  IO  must  attach  a  signed  copy  of  the  ADA  Reviewer/Investigator Independence Statement to the ADA Report. (T-0) 3.7.5.  A  statement  noting  that  the  investigation  is  the  individual’s  primary  duty  until completion.   14  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 4 PRELIMINARY ADA REVIEWS  4.1.  Background.  A  preliminary  ADA  review  is  performed  to  gather  basic  facts  and circumstances,  determine  whether  a  potential  ADA  violation  has  occurred,  and  provide  the information  necessary  to  decide  whether  a  formal  ADA  investigation  is  needed.  A  preliminary review does not attempt to identify the responsible individual(s), recommend corrective actions, or collect other information required during a formal ADA investigation. 4.2.  Sources  of  Potential  ADA  Violations.  Potential  ADA  violations  are  often  identified through  internal  reviews  or  based  on  the  findings  and  recommendations  presented  in  audit reports.    However,  it  is  not  uncommon  for  preliminary  ADA  reviews  to  be  initiated  based  on information  provided  by  individuals  who  suspect  a  potential  ADA  violation  as  a  result  of information acquired through the normal course of business. 4.3.  Inspector  General  (IG)  Hotline  Complaints.  If the need for a preliminary  ADA  review results  from  a  DoD  IG  or  SAF/IG  hotline  complaint,  SAF/FMFA  will  notify  the  appropriate ADA  Focal  Point  (SAF/FMF  at  the  Secretariat  and  Air  Staff),  and  provide  them  with  a preliminary  ADA  review  control  number.  The  PRO  is  advised  that  the  hotline  complaint  is protected communication.  As a result, it is not released, reproduced, or  shared (in whole or in part)  with  any  individual  outside  the  Air  Force  without  the  approval  of  the  Inspector  General who received the complaint. 4.4.  Initial  Review.  When  a  suspected  violation  is  discovered  or  reported,  the  Comptroller  thoroughly researches, analyzes, and discusses the problem with the ADA Focal Point and SJA or servicing legal office, to determine whether it is in fact a potential ADA violation, or just an accounting error.  For accounting errors, the Comptroller takes appropriate corrective actions to correct the errors and report the intended corrective actions to SAF/FMFA for review. 4.4.1.  Preliminary  checks  of  the  applicable  transaction(s)  and  accounting  records  (i.e.,  to identify  recording  duplications  or  errors,  to  ensure  commitments  and  obligations  are  valid and properly chargeable against the funds involved, to validate the actual fund status in the account  affected  at  the  time  the  questionable  transaction  occurred,  etc.)  occurs  prior  to  the reporting of a potential violation and the initiation of a preliminary or formal investigation. 4.4.2.  The initial review may find that there is no potential ADA to report, finding that any discrepancy was the result of a reporting error.  In such cases, no report is needed. 4.4.3.  The  initial  review  may  find  that  an  improper  appropriation  was  obligated  for  an expense,  but  that  a  potential  ADA  may  be  avoided  by  an  accounting  adjustment.    In  such cases,  sufficient  funds  are  clearly  available  for  the  activity  at  issue  at  the  applicable subdivision,  both  at  the  time  the  relevant  obligation  was  incurred  and  when  the  obligation adjustment  is  properly  recorded  in  the  proper  appropriation.    If  such  adjustments  may  be made, no report is needed. Accounting adjustments should be completed in coordination with the servicing legal office. 4.4.4.  If  the  initial  review  determines  that  there  is  credible  evidence  of  a  potential  ADA violation, the suspected violation is reported to SAF/FMFA. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   15  4.5.  Identifying and Reporting  Potential  ADA  Violations.  If, after initial review, a potential ADA  violation  is  suspected,  it  is  reported  through  the  appropriate  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DRU Comptroller  organization  to  SAF/FMF.    The  reporting  comptroller  shall  provide  SAF/FMF  the results of the initial review and sufficient information about the funds involved and the nature of the violation to support its conclusion. (T-1) 4.6.  Preliminary  Review.  If  SAF/FMFA  agrees  that  a  potential  ADA  violation  has  been identified  and  the  potential  violation  cannot  be  avoided  with  accounting  corrections  SAF/FMF will  request  a  Preliminary  ADA  Review  and  assign  a  Preliminary  Review  case  number. (Attachment  3)  This  preliminary  case  number  is  included  in  the  PRR  and  any  subsequent correspondence regarding the preliminary review. 4.6.1.  The  MAJCOM  will  appoint  a  PRO  in  writing,  (Attachment  4)  to  investigate  the potential  ADA  violation  within  two  weeks  of  SAF/FMFA  assignment  of  a  Preliminary Review case number. PROs are selected consistent  with  DoD FMR Volume 14, Chapter 3, Para  030202B  and  Chapter  3  of  this  instruction.  The  suspense  date  for  submitting  the completed PRR to SAF/FMFA is 90 days from the date of the SAF/FMFA Request for the Preliminary Review. 4.6.2.  The  PRO  will  complete  the  potential  ADA  information  sheet  and  provide  the information  sheet  to  the  ADA  Focal  Point  who  will  forward  the  information  sheet  to SAF/FMFA  within  4  weeks  of  the  date  of  the  SAF/FMF  request  for  a  preliminary  ADA review.  An example is provided at Attachment 2.  (T-0) 4.6.3.  The information sheet includes the following information: 4.6.3.1.  Accounting  classification  of  funds  involved,  and  the  associated  line  of accounting (LOA) 4.6.3.2.  Name and location of the activity where the alleged violation occurred 4.6.3.3.  Name and location of the activity issuing the fund authorization 4.6.3.4.  Amount of the alleged violation 4.6.3.5.  Nature of the alleged violation 4.6.3.6.  Date the alleged violation occurred and date discovered 4.6.3.7.  Means of discovery 4.6.3.8.  Description of how the potential violation occurred 4.6.3.9.  Copies  of  any  reports,  investigations,  or  legal  opinions  already  completed  in relation to the potential ADA violation 4.6.3.10.  Expected completion date for the PRR 4.6.3.11.  The  name(s)  and  contact  information  (email  and  telephone  numbers)  of  the PRO and any supporting functional experts that advised the PRO. 4.6.3.12.  A copy of the PRO appointment memorandum. 4.7.  Preliminary  ADA  Review  Timeline.  The DoD FMR, 7000.14-R, Volume 14, Chapter 3, paragraph 030202, November 2010, requires preliminary review completion within 14 weeks of MAJCOM, FOA or DRU Comptroller notification of a potential ADA violation.  The PRO must   16  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 complete  the  ADA  PRR  and  provide  the  PRR  to  the  ADA  Focal  Point  within  9  weeks  of notification to the MAJCOM Comptroller of the potential ADA violation.  (T-1) The ADA Focal Point will review the PRR within two weeks and then coordinate with the SJA or servicing legal office to obtain a legal review of the PRR within two weeks.  The ADA Focal Point will provide a legally sufficient PRR to SAF/FMFA no later than 13 weeks after notification to the MAJCOM Comptroller of the potential ADA violation. 4.8.  Legal Advisor.  Once a PRO has been identified, the Appointing Official’s SJA will assign a judge advocate or civilian attorney to advise the PRO. (T-0) 4.9.  Assignment  of  Functional  Expert.  Functional  expertise  will  be  provided  to  the  PRO through  the  ADA  focal  point,  as  needed.    Areas  of  expertise  may  include  civil  engineering, contract management, and financial management.  The financial management directorate for the installation will provide assistance, as required. 4.10.  PRR  Requirements.  The results of the preliminary ADA review are reported in  a PRR.  Assertions  and  conclusions  presented  in  the  PRR  are  supported  by  documents  attached  to  the PRR  and  referenced  in  the  body  of  the  PRR.    The  PRR  should  discuss  the  issues,  procedures, processes and the areas or functions that were reviewed, evaluated, and investigated. 4.10.1.  The  PRR  should  discuss  the  evolution  of  the  issues  investigated,  mitigating circumstances surrounding the violation, issues that could or could not be proven during the investigation  and  the  supporting  rationale,  any  issues  that  cannot  be  agreed  upon  by  those individuals involved, and any other comments that are pertinent to the investigation. The preliminary review should include results of interviews of individuals involved in the violation, the names, ranks, and titles of the individuals that were interviewed. Testimonies are  sworn testimonies. 4.10.2.  The PRR should summarize relevant testimony and state any presumptions that were sustained  or  rebutted  through  facts  established  by  the  review,  any  questions  of  fact  that cannot be resolved without a formal ADA investigation and any other comments or findings that  are  pertinent  to  the  subject  of  the  review.    An  ADA  violation  may  be  avoided  if  fund control personnel are able to properly certify that the proper funds were available at the time of the initial  obligation  and proper funds are  available at  the time of the correction or fund substitution. The potential violation may be corrected when the proper accounting corrections are complete. If fund control personnel do not provide the certification, then the preliminary review report includes evidence to support a determination that there is a violation of 31 USC § 1341 31 USC § 1517. 4.10.3.  The PRR should describe the roles of the individuals involved, or provide follow-up questions if necessary. 4.10.4.  The  PRR  should  develop  and  explain  the  underlying  basis  for  the  choice  of appropriation.  If an exercise in professional judgment as to the choice of funds appears to be rationally  based,  properly  documented,  and  not  clearly  outside  the  parameters  of  published funding  guidance, at  the time of the decision, then a formal ADA investigation may not  be warranted. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   17  4.10.5.  The  PRR  should  provide  the  impact  of  a  funding  correction  to  an  un-obligated balance  (e.g.,  was  the  un-obligated  balance  in  the  proper  account  sufficient  to  absorb  the funding correction). 4.10.6.  The PRR should establish the context for the alleged funding error or omission (e.g., is  this  really  a  potential  ADA  violation,  or  was  it  simply  an  accounting  error)?    An accounting error is more likely to have occurred if the mistake is discovered shortly after it is made,  and  it  can  be  easily  corrected  without  the  need  for  reprogramming  actions  or withdrawals from a higher-level subdivision of funds. 4.10.7.  The PRR should describe whether the appropriation was exceeded (31 USC § 1341), or whether the lowest administrative subdivision of funds was exceeded (31 USC § 1517).  If the  latter  occurred,  an  ADA  violation  is  still  possible,  but  the  remedy  does  not  require  a supplemental appropriation.  If funds are available for withdrawal from  another program or account,  at  the  lowest  subdivision  of  funds,  to  cover  the  corrective  entry,  and  no  other regulatory or statutory limitation  has been exceeded, then a  formal ADA investigation may not be warranted. 4.10.8.  The  information  required  for  a  complete  PRR  is  presented  in  Attachment  9, Preliminary ADA Review Report Checklist. 4.11.  Legal  Opinion.  The  PRR  is  incomplete  without  an  attached  legal  opinion  from  the Appointing  Official’s  SJA.  However,  the  legal  opinion  should  not  declare  that  an  actual  ADA violation occurred (this is the function of the formal ADA investigation).  The legal office should review  the  completeness  of  the  investigation,  the  legal  validity  of  the  conclusions,  and compliance with this instruction. If the SJA legal opinion identifies a problem with the PRR, the PRR is  sent  back  to  the PRO,  through  the  ADA  Focal  Point,  and  all  issues  are  addressed.  The PRO may review, investigate further, agree or disagree with the SJA and either modify the report or not.  Once all issues have been addressed, the SJA is given the opportunity to review the PRR again and either agree with changes, renew an objection, or recommend further changes. 4.12.  Final  PRR  Transmittal.  After  the  PRR  has  been  completed  and  the  legal  review attached, the ADA Focal Point will prepare the PRR for approval by the Appointing Official and transmittal  to  SAF/FMFA.    The  ADA  Focal  Point  will  communicate  PRR  coordination  delays for signature via email or memorandum, and in the weekly ADA status report to SAF/FMFA. 4.13.  SAF/FMFA  PRR  Review.  SAF/FMFA  will  review  the  final  PRR  for  completeness within one week of receipt. The SAF/FMFA review will assess whether the report is complete, meets  all  administrative  requirements,  and  contains  sufficient  documentation  and  analysis  to support its findings. 4.13.1.  SAF/FMFA shall return any PRR that is incomplete, or otherwise insufficient, to the appropriate ADA focal point for action by the PRO.  SAF/FMFA’s return package contains a transmittal memorandum, which addresses all identified report deficiencies. Upon receipt the PRO should: 4.13.1.1.  Address any deficient areas noted by the SAF/FMFA review. 4.13.1.2.  Gather additional documentary evidence, re-interview witness, and/or interview new witness if and as required.   18  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 4.13.1.3.  Issue  a  formal  addendum  to  the  PRR,  if  the  remedial  action  requires  a substantive  modification  of  the  PRR.    Any  questions  concerning  whether  a  change  is substantive or an addendum is needed should be directed to SAF/FMFA. 4.13.1.4.  Once the PRO and the focal point have resolved all open issues, the focal point will  return  the  revised  report  to  SAF/FMFA  for  review.      The  ADA  Focal  Point  shall ensure that the returned PRR is promptly acted upon and returned to SAF/FMFA within one week, or by the deadline set by SAF/FMFA. 4.13.1.5.  Once  SAF/FMFA  is  satisfied  with  the  PRR  (agreeing  with  its  analysis  and conclusion),  SAF/FMFA  shall  either  issue  a  memorandum  (referring  the  matter  for  a formal investigation or closing it) or forward the PRR to SAF/GCA for legal review. 4.14.  SAF/FMF Action.  In the event SAF/FMF agrees with the findings of the PRO, finds the PRR sufficient, and determines that no additional legal review is required, SAF/FMF shall issue its final decision on the preliminary investigation. 4.14.1.  PRR  Recommendation  of  No  Formal  Investigation.    Once  all  issues  have  been addressed  and  SAF/FMFA  agrees  with  the  PRR  findings  of  no  formal  investigation,  a SAF/FMF transmittal memorandum will be prepared, notifying the ADA Focal Point that the case will be closed. 4.14.2.  PRR Recommendation of Formal Investigation. Once all issues have been addressed and SAF/FMFA agrees with PRR findings that a formal investigation is required, SAF/FMF shall document its final decision in a memorandum to the appropriate MAJCOM appointing official,  initiating  the  formal  ADA  investigation.    SAF/FMFA  will  also  provide  a  copy  to OUSD(C) as notification that a formal ADA investigation has been initiated. 4.15.  Legal  Review.  If  SAF/FMFA  requires  a transmittal memorandum  will be prepared requesting SAF/GCA legal  review of the PRR.  The transmittal memorandum  includes  the  final  PRR,  the  legal  review  of  the  PRR,  and  documentation  of  any accounting adjustments that were made to correct the potential violation.  The entire Preliminary case  file  is  provided  concurrent  with  the  delivery  of  the  transmittal  memorandum.    SAF/GCA will complete their legal review of the PRR, and provide a written opinion to SAF/FMF within a recommended 4 weeks. legal  review,  a  SAF/FMF 4.15.1.  If  SAF/GCA  issues  a  legal  opinion  agreeing  with  the  PRR,  that  no  formal investigation is required, a SAF/FMF transmittal memorandum will be prepared notifying the ADA Focal Point that the case will be closed and documenting its decision in the case. 4.15.2.  If  SAF/GCA  issues  a  legal  opinion  agreeing  with  the  PRR,  that  a  formal investigation  should  be  initiated,  SAF/FMF  shall  document  its  final  decision  in  a memorandum  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  appointing  official.    SAF/FMFA  will  also provide  a  copy  to  OUSD(C)  as  notification  if  a  formal  ADA  investigation  is  initiated.    If SAF/GCA’s  opinion  agrees  with  the  PRR’s  conclusion,  but  rejects  the  PROs  analysis  and rationale  (and  SAF/FMF  concurs),  the  SAF/FMF  memorandum  initiating  the  formal investigation shall document the analysis that served as the basis for its decision. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   19  4.15.3.  If SAF/GCA issues a legal opinion disagreeing with the conclusion of the PRO, and SAF/FMFA  agrees,  SAF/FMFA  shall  document  its  final  decision  and  rationale  in  the pertinent  transmittal  memorandum.    The  transmittal  memorandum  must  contain  sufficient detail to document the report’s new finding.   20  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 5 FORMAL ADA INVESTIGATIONS  5.1.  Background.  The purpose of an ADA violation investigation is to determine the event that caused  the  potential  violation,  the  responsible  individual(s),  action(s)  required  to  correct  the violation,  and  action(s)  taken  to  ensure  that  a  similar  violation  does  not  occur  in  the  future.  When  a  preliminary  review  determines  a  potential  ADA  violation  has  occurred,  a  formal investigation is needed under the provisions of DoD FMR Volume 14. Generally, the existence of  a  potential  violation  is  established  during  the  preliminary  review  and  before  a  formal investigation  begins.  Formal  ADA  investigations  are  requested  by  SAF/FMF  after  the determination  that  a  potential  ADA  violation  has  occurred  and  a  formal  investigation  is warranted.    A  formal  ADA  investigation  is  also  performed  when  specifically  requested  by OUSD(C) or SAF/FM. 5.2.  Formal ADA Timeline.  The Appointing Official ensures the formal ADA investigation is the IO’s primary duty until the formal case is closed.  The Appointing Official also ensures that a legally  sufficient  ADA  Report  is  transmitted  to  SAF/FMF  within  17  weeks  of  the  start  of  the formal investigation.  See Attachment 16 for timeline.    The DoD FMR, Volume14, Chapter 7, requires  the  delivery  of  the  final  ADA  Report  to  OUSD(C)  Deputy  Chief  Financial  Officer (DCFO) within 12 months and 2 weeks (54 weeks) from the date the preliminary review ended.  If there was no related preliminary review, the final ADA Report is due twelve months from the formal investigation start date. 5.3.  Suspected Criminal Conduct.  The DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14, Chapter 5 requires if at any time during an investigation, the IO believes there may be a criminal issue(s) involved, the investigation is stopped immediately.  The IO consults with legal counsel to determine if the issue  should  be  referred  to  appropriate  criminal  investigators  for  resolution.  When  appropriate, formal  ADA  investigations  are  coordinated  through  the  servicing  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigations  (AFOSI)  detachment,  where  a  determination  is  made  on  whether  to  open  an AFOSI investigation. 5.4.  Investigation of Senior Leader Actions. 5.4.1.  If the subject of the ADA report involves actions of a O-6 (Colonel) and/or GS/GM-15  or  equivalent  SAF/FMFA  will  notify  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Office  of  the Inspector  General,  Complaints Resolution  Directorate  (SAF/IGQ)  for  allegations  against an O-6 (Colonel) and/or GS/GM-15 or equivalent (AFI 90-301, chapter 5). 5.4.2.  If the subject of the ADA report involves actions of an O-7 (Brigadier General), O-7 select or above, current or former Civilian above the grade of GS/GM-15, or equivalent grade in  other civilian pay schedules, current  or former members of the Senior Executive Service (SES),  or  current  or  former  Air  Force  (Civilian)  Presidential  Appointees  (AFI  90-301, chapter  4).  SAF/FMFA  will  notify  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Office  of  the  Inspector General, Senior Official Inquiries Directorate (SAF/IGS). 5.5.  IO  Appointment.  The  MAJCOM,  FOA,  and  DRU  Commander,  or  SAF/FMF  for  the Secretariat and Air Staff (hereinafter, referred to as the “Appointing Official”), in a written letter of designation, appoints a qualified IO to conduct a formal ADA investigation.  The Appointing Official  may  delegate  appointing  authority  to  a  member  of  their  staff  (e.g.  Comptroller).    The AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   21  Appointing Official may designate the same person that served as the PRO to serve as the IO for the formal investigation. See Chapter 3 of this AFI, “Selecting an Investigating Officer”. 5.6.  IO Responsibilities.  The IO will prepare an ADA Report that contains all of the evidence required to support a factually and legally sound determination that an ADA violation has or has not  occurred.    (T-0)  The  IO  will  also  accomplish  the  formal  ADA  investigation  within  the framework  of  DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation  7000.14-R,  Volume  14,  with  proper regard  for  the  substantive  and  procedural  rights  of  the  potentially  responsible  individual(s),  as explained within this guidance.  (T-0) 5.6.1.  The IO identifies and documents the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding the potential  ADA  violation,  which  consists  largely  of  a  validation  of  facts  found  in  a preliminary ADA review. 5.6.2.  The IO states a conclusion as to the existence of an actual ADA violation, supported by the evidence and applicable legal precedent. 5.6.3.  The IO identifies the events which caused the ADA violation. 5.6.4.  The IO establishes whose action or inaction brought about the ADA violation, and the highest level of management that could have prevented the violation.  The person identified may be named as the responsible party at the conclusion of the investigation. 5.6.5.  The  IO  identifies  the  required  procedural,  accounting  and  funding  corrections  and whether the corrections have already been made. 5.6.6.  The  IO  documents  management  actions  taken  to  prevent  a  recurrence  of  the  ADA violation. 5.7.  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA)  Investigative  Role.  The  Appointing  Official’s  SJA  or servicing  legal  office  will  assign  an  attorney  to  advise  the  IO.  (T-0)    The  IO  consults  with  the legal advisor before beginning the investigation and should consult with the legal advisor on the case periodically thereafter. 5.7.1.  A  formal  investigator  may  face  a  number  of  legal  issues  during  the  course  of  the investigation  and  is  expected  to  take  statements.  A  formal  investigator  consults  with appropriate legal counsel on any legal issues associated with the investigation. 5.8.  Assigning  Functional  Experts.  If  a  potential  violation  appears  to  involve  a  complex situation  or  a  multitude  of  functional  areas,  then  a  “team  approach”  may  be  necessary.    The Appointing  Official  ensures  the  IO  receives  adequate  support,  including  access  to  additional personnel with the requisite knowledge in all of the functional areas involved. 5.9.  Gathering  and  Reviewing  Evidence.  The  IO  does  the  following,  when  gathering  and reviewing evidence: 5.9.1.  Reviews the PRR and legal  review(s) to  ensure a full understanding of the  facts  and circumstances of the potential ADA violation. 5.9.2.  Identifies by name, rank/grade, and duty title, the holder of the funds (e.g., Colonel J. J. Smith, 9999 Air Wing Commander) and obtains an evaluation of the performance of their funds control responsibilities.  The level of command immediately above the holder of funds normally furnishes this evaluation.   22  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 5.9.3.  Examines the documentary evidence associated with the potential ADA violation (i.e., transaction  and  funding  documents,  management’s  approval  of  the  transaction  and  funding documents, regulatory or statutory limitations, etc.), lists each document, and includes a copy of each document in the ADA Report.  Citations are included in the body of the document if references are made to attachments or other information in the ADA Report. 5.9.4.  Examines  relevant  circumstantial  evidence,  associated  with  the  potential  ADA violation, and describes how each piece of circumstantial evidence relates to the case, as well as,  the  weight  given  to  such  evidence  in  arriving  at  a  conclusion.    Circumstantial  evidence consists of facts or circumstances from which the existence or nonexistence of a fact may be inferred. 5.9.5.  Obtains and documents pertinent personal testimony per section 5.10, below. 5.9.6.  Assembles and analyzes the documented evidence.  Specifically: 5.9.6.1.  Develops  and  documents  a  list  of  findings,  based  upon  the  evidence,  and identifies the evidence that supports each finding. 5.9.6.2.  Develops  and  documents  a  list  of  conclusions,  including  which  specific  act  or failure  to  act  that  caused  the  potential  ADA  violation,  and  identifies  the  evidence  and findings that support each conclusion. 5.9.6.3.  Determines and confirms whether an ADA violation actually occurred and, if so, documents  the  specific  section  of  Title  31,  U.S.C.  (e.g.,  Sections  1341(a),  1342,  and 1517(a)) that was violated.  This determination should be made in consultation with the assigned legal advisor. 5.9.6.4.  Identifies  the  date  the  ADA  violation  occurred,  the  date  the  violation  was discovered,  the  amount  of  the  violation,  and  the  Treasury  symbol,  year,  and  title  of  the appropriation (e.g., 5703400, Air Force, Fiscal Year 2010, Operations and Maintenance). 5.9.6.5.  Determines  if  the  acts  that  caused  the  ADA  violation  were  in  compliance  with established internal controls or local operating procedures. If not, the IO determines why the  internal  controls  or  operating  procedures  were  deficient  and  recommends  the appropriate improvements necessary to prevent future violations. 5.9.6.6.  Determines the individual or individuals responsible for the ADA. 5.10.  Obtaining Testimony.  The IO should obtain sworn testimony from all individuals having knowledge  of  the  transactions  and  events  surrounding  the  suspected  ADA  violation,  including the  individual(s)  tentatively  identified  as  responsible  for  the  ADA  violation.    Sworn  testimony (provided  under  oath  to  the  IO)  is  desired  because  it  has  greater  evidentiary  value,  puts  the witness (interviewee) on notice that the interview is a serious matter, and subjects the witness to penalties for perjury or making a false statement.  Electronically recorded (verbatim) transcripts of  testimony  should  be  obtained  whenever  possible.    The  IO  must  include  the  results  of  all testimonies obtained, including documentary evidence, in  the  ADA Report.   (T-0)  If testimony given by a witness conflicts with documentary or testimonial evidence, the IO must re-interview the  witness  and  seek  corroboration  by  interviewing  additional  witnesses,  if  appropriate.    (T-0) The ADA Investigator Training provides instructions on how to prepare for and conduct an  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   23  interview  under  oath.    The  IO  may  also  use  the  investigative  procedures  described  in  AFI  90-301,  Inspector  General  Complaints  Resolution,  as  a  point  of  reference  only,  for  obtaining testimony. Specifically, when obtaining sworn testimony the IO will:  5.10.1.  Interview  all  of  the  individuals  involved  with  the  suspected  transactions  and documents  their  testimony.  (T-0)    This  includes individuals  who  either  initiated  the  actions under investigation, or who provided input or advice to the individuals that made or approved the decisions.  The IO must establish the role of all participants in the specific decisions or actions taken, as well as, their functional responsibilities in the organization. (T-0) 5.10.2.  Provide  the  individual(s)  with  a  copy  of  the  Privacy  Act  Statement,  Attachment  7, (before  the  interview  begins),  asks  the  individual(s)  to  read  the  statement,  then  ask,  for  the record, if they have read and understand the Privacy Act Statement. (T-1) 5.10.3.  Recognize  that  an  unqualified  promise  of  confidentiality  cannot  be  offered  to  a witness  during  a  formal  ADA  investigation,  due  to  the  regulatory  requirement  that  the responsible individual(s) must be provided with a copy of the ADA Report, for comment and presentation  of  rebuttal  evidence  or  additional  witnesses.  (T-0)  Only  personal  information protected under the Privacy Act, or qualifying for an exception to release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), can be withheld from release. 5.10.4.  Elicit  an  explanation  from  the  individual(s),  who  is  potentially  responsible  for  the suspected ADA violation, for their role or actions in the violation.  Before interviewing the individual(s),  the  IO  should  consult  the  assigned  legal  advisor  and  installation  SJA  or servicing  legal  office.    If  the  individual(s)  knowingly  and  willfully  committed  the  ADA violation,  or  that  the  individual(s)  made  a  conscious  and  deliberate  attempt  to  circumvent fiscal  law  or  established  procedures,  the  individual(s)  may  be  a  “suspect”  and  entitled  to  a rights  advisement  in  accordance  with  Article  31,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice,  and/or the  5th  Amendment,  United  States  Constitution.    Similarly,  if  during  the  interview  an individual(s)  becomes  a  suspect,  the  IO  should  immediately  terminate  the  interview  and consult the legal advisor and installation SJA or servicing legal office.  The SJA or servicing legal office will then coordinate the matter with the AFOSI, to determine whether a separate criminal investigation should be initiated. (T-0) See paragraph 5.3. of this instruction. 5.10.5.  Consult  with  the  assigned  legal  advisor  and  installation  SJA,  if  civilian  employees (including  non-appropriated  fund  employees)  are  members  of  a  collective  bargaining  unit. Specifically,  these  employees  may  have  a  right  to  union  representation,  if  they  reasonably believe that disciplinary actions can be taken against them, as a result of the interview, and they request representation. (or if union representation is otherwise required under the terms of  the  existing  collective  bargaining  unit)  Similarly,  contract  employees  might  also  be afforded  certain  rights  under  their  respective  contract.    DoD  FMR  7000.14-R,  Volume  14, Chapter  7,  requires  that  the  person(s)  named  responsible  in  an  ADA  Report  be  given  an opportunity  to  read  the  report  of  facts  and  circumstances  leading  to  the  violation.    This includes  transcripts  of  witness  statements.    However,  a  responsible  individual’s  right  to review  a  copy  of  the  ADA  Report  does  not  automatically  create  a  corresponding  right  of access  in  third  parties,  and  until  the  report  is  approved  by  OUSD(C)  for  transmittal  to  the President,  through  OMB,  and  to  the  Congress,  it  should  be  treated  as  a  pre-decisional document.    Pending  approval  by  OUSD(C),  the  ADA  Report,  summary  report,  and  all   24  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 interim  drafts  should  be  marked  “For  Official  Use  Only.”    See  DoD  Manual  5200.1  for  a discussion of the proper application of the FOUO legend. See AFI 33-332 for a discussion of promises of confidentiality covered under the Privacy Act. 5.11.  Determining  Responsibility.  A  responsible  individual  is  the  person  who  authorized  or created the distribution, obligation, or expenditure in  question.  A formal ADA investigation is considered  incomplete  until  at  least  one  individual  has  been  named  responsible  for  the  ADA violation,  or it has been  determined that no ADA violation has occurred.   The  IO’s conclusion that  a  responsible  individual  could  not  be  identified  for  an  ADA  violation  is  not  acceptable.  Identification  of  more  than  one  responsible  individual  may  be  required,  under  certain circumstances. The IO does the following, when determining responsibility:  5.11.1.  Analyze  all  pertinent  facts  and  circumstances  before  affixing  responsibility  for  an ADA violation.  The responsible individual(s), generally, is the highest-ranking official that had  actual  or  constructive  knowledge  of  precisely  what  actions  were  taken  and  the impropriety or questionable nature of such actions.  Often, the responsible individual(s) have knowledge of either factor.  However, the person in the best position to prevent the ultimate error  is  the  highest-ranking  official  who  was  aware  of  both  factors.    The  IO  attempts  to discover  the  specific  act  or  the  failure  to  act,  that  caused  the  violation  and  who  was responsible.    The  IO  will  clearly  document  what  the  individual(s)  did,  or  failed  to  do,  to cause  or  contribute  to  the  ADA  violation.  (T-0)    The  IO  will  also  assess  and  document whether the responsible individual(s) committed the ADA violation knowingly and willfully. (T-0) 5.11.2.  Determine to what extent, and to what degree, the individual(s) was responsible for the ADA violation. (T-0)  Specifically, 5.11.3.  If  operating  personnel  failed  to  follow  established  internal  controls  or  operating procedures,  identify  that  individual(s)  as  bearing  a  significant  responsibility  for  the  ADA violation. (T-0) 5.11.4.  If a supervisor requested the employee(s) to disregard established internal controls or operating  procedures,  identify  the  supervisor  as  bearing  a  significant  responsibility  for  the ADA violation. (T-0) 5.11.5.  If  the  established  internal  controls  or  operating  procedures  are  deficient,  and  the deficiencies were a major contributing cause of the violation, identify the supervisor that was responsible for the controls  or procedures as bearing significant  responsibility for the ADA violation. (T-0) 5.11.6.  May  identify  a  Commander,  budget  officer,  or  fiscal  officer  as  responsible,  due  to their overall responsibility and position, or the fact that they are designated as the holder of funds,  but  only  if  they  failed  to  properly  exercise  their  responsibilities.  (T-0)      If  it  is impossible  to  identify  the  individual(s)  whose  actions  or  inactions  brought  about  the  ADA violation, the IO must assign the Holder of Funds as the responsible individual. (T-0) 5.11.7.  If  the  violation  involves  a  centrally  managed  allotment,  identify  the  head  of  the operating  agency,  at  the  time  the  violation  occurred,  as  responsible  for  the  ADA  violation. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   25  (T-0)    However,  other  individuals  may  also  be  identified  as  responsible  for  the  ADA violation. 5.11.8.  If an accounting error caused the ADA violation, identify the individual(s) who made the  accounting  error  as  responsible,  assuming  no  other  official  should  have  detected  the mistake.   (T-0) 5.12.  Corrective Actions and Lessons Learned.  The IO determines why the internal controls or  operating  procedures  were  deficient  and  makes  recommendations  to  improve  processes  to prevent future violations.  The IO identifies any remedial action taken or planned by the affected organization,  to  correct  the  accounts  and  properly  fund  the  subject  liability,  and  to  prevent  a recurrence. 5.12.1.  In accordance with the DoD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 14,  the  investigating  officer’s  responsibilities  include  recommending  actions  to  prevent future  violations  of  a  similar  type  (procedural  corrections)  and  correct  the  specific  adverse funding condition (funding corrections) that resulted from the violation. When the causes and the  individual  (s)  responsible  for  the  violation  have  been  determined,  the  DoD  Component under  investigation,  working  with  the  IO,  determines  the  corrective  actions  necessary  to ensure a violation of a similar nature does not recur.  Those actions are included in the ADA Violation Report. 5.12.2.  The DoD Component under investigation provides a list of “lessons learned,” for use by others in  addressing  similar circumstances, by  consulting with  the management officials involved.  The  DoD  Component,  working  with  the  IO,  shall  develop  a  summary  of  lessons learned  from  the  specific  circumstances  of  the  case  that  can  be  applied  to  the  installation involved, the major command, the DoD Component, or all DoD Components.  (T-0) 5.13.  Preparing  the  ADA  Report.  The  IO  must  document  the  results  of  the  formal  ADA investigation in an ADA Report. (T-0)   The Report is either an “ADA Violation Report” or an “ADA No Violation Report,” depending on the outcome of the formal investigation. The Appointing Official, in consultation with his/her MAJCOM SJA or servicing legal office approves the ADA Report and makes a determination as to whether the draft ADA Report recommends reporting an ADA violation to SAF/FMF. The report is considered a draft until the IO’s conclusion has been reviewed by OSD and received their concurrence.  The ADA Report should provide all information necessary to support the IO’s conclusion, properly referenced and documented, in the prescribed format.  The format is prescribed in the Formal ADA Report Checklist (Attachment 10).   5.13.1.  The IO completes the ADA Report Checklist, (Attachment 10), at the conclusion of the formal ADA investigation, to ensure that all requirements have been met, except for the administration of disciplinary actions, if warranted. 5.13.2.  The IO includes a copy of the signed completed checklist in the ADA Report. 5.13.3.  The  IO  forwards  the  ADA  Report  (including  all  attachments,  addenda,  and checklists) to the ADA Focal Point (SAF/FMFA, at the Secretariat and Air Staff) for review within  8  weeks  of  the  formal  investigation  start  date.    The  ADA  Focal  Point  will  obtain  a legal  opinion from  the  Appointing Official’s SJA or servicing legal  office.  After the ADA Report has been determined legally sufficient, the Focal Point will provide the ADA Report,   26  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 signed ADA Report Checklist, and SJA legal review to SAF/FMFA no later than 17 weeks after the formal investigation start date.  However, SAF/FMF may allow less time, depending on the extent of the violation. 5.14.  Releasing  the  ADA  Report  to  the  Responsible  Individual(s)  for  Comment.  Once the SJA or appropriate servicing legal office has determined the ADA Report to be legally sufficient the individual(s) initially determined by the  IO to be responsible must be notified that they are being held responsible for the violation, and provided the opportunity to review the ADA Report and provide pertinent additional information.  The ADA Focal Point will direct the IO to do the following: 5.14.1.  Provide  the  responsible  individual(s)  an  opportunity  to  read  the  ADA  Report  (after Appointing  Official’s  SJA  or  servicing  legal  office  approval),  excluding  any  written  legal advice  provided  to  the  IO.    The  IO  should  prepare  a  cover  memorandum,  mail  the  ADA Report to the responsible individual(s) (via registered mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested).  The IO should advise the responsible individual(s) of the following: 5.14.1.1.  An  ADA  violation  has  occurred,  and  there  has  been  an  initial  determination that  they  are  a  responsible  individual  for  the  violation,  and  they  are  being  allowed  an opportunity to review the ADA Report and examine evidence on which the determination was based. The individual must be given the opportunity to comment or provide rebuttal evidence and may provide pertinent  additional information,  which was not  addressed in the  ADA  Report,  including  the  names  of  additional  witnesses.    The  responsible individual(s)  may  also  refute  statements  made  by  others,  through  a  sworn  or  un-sworn statement, or identify additional documentary evidence. 5.14.1.2.  The responsible individuals may consult with private legal counsel at their own expense or, when applicable, a union representative.  Military members may also consult the Area Defense Counsel. 5.14.1.3.  The  responsible  party  may  submit  documentary  evidence,  physical  evidence, and  a  statement/rebuttal  to  the  IO.    In  addition,  the  responsible  party  may  designate witnesses  to  testify  on  their  behalf.    Designated  witnesses  are  either  interviewed,  or provided an opportunity to make a written statement for the record. 5.14.2.  Document  the  refusal  to  comment.    Generally,  the  IO  will  allow  10  days  for  the responsible individual to respond.  If the individual(s) declines to make a statement, the IO will indicate this in an addendum to the ADA Report.  If the responsible individual(s) refuses to give a statement, they should submit a signed statement of declination.  If the responsible individual(s) refuses to sign a statement of declination, the IO should include a statement to that  effect  in  an  addendum  to  the  ADA  Report.    If  the  responsible  individual(s)  cannot  be located,  despite  a  diligent  effort,  the  IO  should  include  a  statement  to  that  effect  in  an addendum to the ADA Report. 5.14.3.  Collect and evaluate all comments and rebuttal evidence provided by the responsible individual(s),  make  a  final  determination  of  who  should  be  held  responsible  for  the  ADA violation and why, determine whether the individual(s) knowingly or willfully committed the violation,  and  include  all  of  this  information  in  an  addendum  to  the  ADA  Report.    ADA Report attachments and the ADA Report Checklist should be updated accordingly. AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   27  5.14.4.  The  IO  must  revise  the  ADA  Report,  if  substantial  changes  occur  (due  to  new  or conflicting facts and circumstances discovered or comments and rebuttal evidence received), and provide the responsible individual(s) an opportunity to read the revised ADA Report and provide additional comments or rebuttal evidence to the revision. 5.15.  ADA  Report  Transmittal.  The  ADA  Focal  Point  will  review  the  ADA  Report  for accuracy and completeness after responsible individual(s) comments have been addressed by the IO,  and  forward  the  revised  ADA  Report  to  the  Appointing  Official’s  SJA  or  servicing  legal office for further legal review.   If the SJA determines that the amended ADA Report is legally sufficient, the ADA Focal Point does the following: 5.15.1.  Prepares  a  Comptroller  Transmittal  of  ADA  Report  Memorandum  (see  Attachment 11), and forwards the ADA Report package to the Comptroller, for review and approval. 5.15.2.  Transmits  an  electronic  version  of  the  original  ADA  Report  package  and  ADA Report to SAF/FMFA, via email or another file transfer method established by SAF/FMFA. 5.15.3.  Retains  a  copy  of  the  ADA  Report  package.    If  it  is  determined  that  an  ADA violation  occurred,  the  ADA  Focal  Point  will  have  to  forward  these  documents  to  the Appointing Official. 5.16.  SAF/FMFA  review  of  the  ADA  Report.  SAF/FMFA  will  review  the  ADA  report  for completeness, adequacy of facts presented in support of the conclusions reached, sufficiency of analysis, and the adequacy of evidentiary documentation. SAF/FMFA shall: 5.16.1.  Assess  whether  the  report  is  complete,  and  meets  all  administrative  requirements.  SAF/FMFA  will  ensure  all  Formal  ADA  Checklist  requirements  are  included  in  the  ADA report. 5.16.2.  Review  and  approve  the  draft  ADA  Report  provided  by  the  ADA  Focal  Point  to ensure the testimony, documentation, analysis, and conclusions are acceptable. 5.16.3.  Review any accounting corrections proposed or made pursuant to the investigation to ensure  propriety  and  accuracy  of  the  adjustment  and  adherence  to  proper  accounting standards. 5.16.4.  Review  the  adequacy  of  the  procedural  or  policy  changes  already  instituted  or otherwise proposed by the IO to prevent similar violations from recurring. 5.16.5.  Ensure  the  IO  has  properly  identified  the  individual(s)  responsible  for  the  violation (providing sufficient evidence and analysis), named the holder(s) of the funds, and evaluated the execution of DoD administrative fund controls. 5.16.6.  Review  and  address  any  other  matters  related  to  the  report’s  administrative compliance, quality, and completeness. 5.17.  SAF/FMF  Identified  Deficiencies.  SAF/FMFA  shall  return  any  ADA  Report  that  is incomplete,  or  otherwise  insufficient,  to  the  appropriate  ADA  focal  point  for  action  by  the  IO.   SAF/FMFA’s  return  package  shall  contain  a  transmittal  memorandum,  which  addresses  all identified report deficiencies. Upon receipt the IO shall: 5.17.1.  Address any deficient areas noted by the SAF/FMFA review. (T-1)   28  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 5.17.2.  Gather  additional  documentary  evidence,  re-interview  witnesses,  and/or  interview new witnesses if and as required. 5.17.3.  Issue  a  formal  addendum  to  the  ADA  report,  if  the  remedial  action  requires  a substantive modification of the report. (T-1)   Any questions concerning whether a change is substantive or an addendum is needed should be directed to SAF/FMFA. 5.17.4.  Once the IO and the focal point have resolved all open issues the focal point returns the  revised  report  to  SAF/FMFA  for  review.  (T-1)  SAF/FMFA,  in  coordination  with  the ADA focal point, shall determine whether any changes to the report require additional review by the responsible parties.  The ADA Focal Point shall ensure that the returned ADA report is promptly acted upon and returned to SAF/FMFA within one week or by the deadline set by SAF/FMFA. 5.18.  Request  for  Legal  Opinion.  Once  SAF/FMFA  is  satisfied  with  the  ADA  Report,  a SAF/FMF  transmittal  memorandum  will  be  prepared  requesting  SAF/GCA  legal  review  of  the ADA Report.  The transmittal memorandum summarizes SAF/FMFA’s review and conclusions, identifying  any  specific  concerns  or  deficiencies  noted.  The  memorandum  includes  the  final report (with all addendums), all attachments to the report, the SJA legal review, documentation of  any  accounting  adjustments  that  were  made  to  correct  the  potential  violation,  and  the  entire preliminary investigation file. 5.19.  Legal Review.  SAF/GCA shall review the package and provide a written legal opinion. 5.19.1.  If  SAF/GCA  finds  the  ADA  Report  legally  insufficient,  such  that  additional information,  analysis,  or  interviews  are  necessary  before  a  determination  on  the  potential ADA  violation  may  be  made,  SAF/GCA  shall  provide  a  written  legal  opinion  which identifies  all  noted  deficiencies.      The  opinion,  along  with  the  package,  is  returned  to SAF/FMFA.  SAF/FMFA  works  with  the  appropriate  ADA  focal  point  and  IO  to  resolve these  deficiencies  in  accordance  with  paragraph  5.17,  above.  Once  all  deficiencies  are addressed, SAF/FMF shall resubmit the package to SAF/GCA for review. 5.19.2.  If SAF/GCA issues a legal opinion agreeing with the IO (in whole or in part), that a potential  ADA  violation  has  occurred,  SAF/FMF  shall  document  its  final  decision  in  a memorandum  to  OUSD(C).      If  SAF/GCA’s  opinion  agrees  with  the  IO’s  conclusion,  but rejects the IO’s analysis and rationale (and SAF/FMF concurs), the SAF/FMF memorandum must  document  the  analysis  that  served  as  the  basis  for  its  decision.    In  these  cases, SAF/FMF (in coordination with SAF/GC) must determine whether the change in rationale is substantively  significant,  such  that  the  responsible  parties  did  not  have  a  meaningful opportunity to review the basis for the ADA and provide a response.  Where the new basis for the ADA is a significant departure from the rationale of the IO, the responsible parties are granted  another  opportunity  to  review  the  package  with  the  FMF  final  decision.    In  these instances, FMF shall issue a transmittal memorandum to the ADA focal point for action. 5.19.3.  If  SAF/GCA  issues  a  legal  opinion  disagreeing  with  the  conclusion  of  the  IO  and SAF/FMFA agrees with the IO, SAF/FMFA shall document its final decision and rationale in the pertinent transmittal memorandum. 5.19.4.  Where SAF/GCA and FMF disagree with the IO and determine that an ADA has not occurred the memorandum should be sent to OUSD(C). AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   29  5.19.5.  Where SAF/GCA and FMF disagree with the IO and determine that a potential ADA has occurred, the memorandum is sent to the appropriate ADA focal point for action by the IO.    The  FMF  transmittal  memorandum  must  document  the  new  conclusion,  its  basis, analysis  and  supporting  facts.    In  these  cases,  the  IO  is  charged  with  identifying  the responsible parties and providing them an opportunity to respond to the report (as amended by  the  FMF  transmittal  memorandum).    This  work  (identifying  responsible  parties  and providing  them  an  opportunity  to  be  heard)  is  documented  through  an  addendum  to  the report. Upon receipt of the amended ADA report, FMF will review and forward the package to SAF/GCA, consistent with this instruction.  Once the legal review is complete, SAF/FMF shall document its final decision in a memorandum to OUSD(C). 5.20.  The  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  Comptroller  (OUSD(C)  Review  and Determination.  The  OUSD  Comptroller  makes  the  final  determination  with  respect  to  the existence of an ADA and identification of the responsible individual (s). 5.20.1.  Once the responsible individual (s) have been provided the opportunity to review and respond  to  the  ADA  report  and  the  SAF/GCA  legal  opinion  is  obtained,  SAF/FMFA forwards  the  ADA  Report  to  OUSD(C)  for  the  review  and  determination.    OUSD  (C) provides  an  advance  decision  on  the  ADA  case  prior  to  the  administration  of  disciplinary actions. 5.20.2.  The  report  for  submission  to  OUSD  (C)  should  include  the  following:  The transmittal  memorandum  from  SAF/FMF,  the  Report  of  Violation,  Summary  Report  of Violation, statements of responsible person (s), and all associated legal reviews. 5.20.3.  If  OUSD(C)  notes  deficient  areas  of  the  report  OUSD(C)  notifies  SAF/FMFA  and SAF/FMFA ensures that all deficient areas noted by the OUSD(C) review are addressed. SAF/FMFA works with the appropriate ADA focal point and IO to resolve these deficiencies in accordance with paragraph 5.17, above. Once all deficiencies are addressed, SAF/FMF shall resubmit the package to OUSD(C) for review.  5.20.4.  If  OUSD(C)  and  DoD  Office  of  the  General  Counsel  (Fiscal)  (OGC  (F))  make  a determination of no ADA violation, SAF/FMFA will notify the ADA Focal Point.  The ADA Focal Point notifies the individual (s) named responsible of the determination of no violation and generally, no disciplinary actions is administered, and the case is closed. However, if the investigation reveals other potential misconduct the matter may be referred to appropriate Air Force  officials  for  further  investigation  and/or  consideration  of  appropriate  disciplinary action. 5.20.5.  If OUSD(C) agrees that an ADA violation did occur, SAF/FMFA notifies the focal point to refer the matter to the disciplinary official(s), so that appropriate disciplinary action may  be  considered  for  individuals  found  to  be  responsible  for  the  ADA,  including  the designation of an appropriate disciplinary official(s). 5.20.6.  If  OUSD(C)  disagrees  with  a  finding  of  no  violation,  SAF/FMFA  will  notifies  the ADA  focal  point  who  will  direct  the  IO  to  re-open  and  complete  the  case,  including  the identification of the responsible individual(s). 5.20.6.1.  Once  the  responsible  individual  (s)  have  been  provided  the  opportunity  to review  and  respond  to  the  ADA  report  and  the  SAF/GCA  legal  opinion  is  obtained,   30  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 SAF/FMFA shall resubmit the package along with the addendum to OUSD(C) for review and determination. 5.20.6.2.  If OUSD(C) agrees with the addendum to the report and that an ADA violation did  occur, SAF/FMFA  will notify the ADA focal  point, so that appropriate disciplinary action may be considered for individuals found to be responsible for the ADA, including the designation of the appropriate disciplinary official(s). 5.21.  Upon  Completion  of  the  Review  and  Determination  and  the  OUSD  (C)  Final Determination of the Responsible Individual: 5.21.1.  SAF/FMFA  will  complete  the  Summary  Report  of  Violation  (SRV)  and  the  final closure package to OUSD(C). 5.21.2.  Upon  completion  of  disciplinary  actions,  SAF/FMFA  will  update  the  SRV  and prepare the transmittal letter.  The transmittal letter documents the completion of disciplinary actions, and the resolution of the case. 5.21.3.  SAF/FMFA  will  submit  a  final  closure  package  to  OUSD(C).    The  final  closure ADA  case  file  includes:  the  transmittal  memorandum,  the  SRV,  the  acknowledgment statement  (Attachment  13)  and  Commensurate  Action  Statement  (Attachment  14)  from  the disciplinary official (with responsibility for determining the appropriate disciplinary action), corrective actions, and legal coordination. 5.22.  Releasing the ADA Report to Internal or External Agencies: 5.22.1.  The  PRO,  IO,  ADA  Focal  Point,  Appointing  Official,  Comptroller  or  any  other individuals involved in a preliminary ADA review or formal ADA investigation should not release the PRR or ADA Report to anyone that is not participating in the ADA investigation.  The  ADA  Report  is  incomplete  until  finally  approved  by  OUSD(C).    The  ADA  Report should  be  protected  in  accordance  with  AFI  31-401,  Information  Security  Program Management. 5.22.2.  The  Appointing  Official  or  Comptroller  should  consult  with  the  Appointing Official’s  SJA  or  servicing  legal  office  (AF/JAA  and  SAF/GCA,  at  the  Secretariat  and  Air Staff) before releasing the Final ADA Report to any internal or external agency.  Report all substantiated  findings  of  ADA  violations  along  with  disciplinary  actions  to  SAF/IGQ  IAW AFI 90-301, Chapter 5 Table 5.3 Rule 8. 5.22.3.  All  legal  reviews  provided  in  the  course  of  a  preliminary  or  formal  ADA investigation are privileged and may not be released outside the Air Force or DoD without a waiver of the privilege by the proper official.   These privileges should not be waived without consultation with SAF/FM and SAF/GC. 5.23.  Monthly Status Updates for On-Going ADA Investigations: 5.23.1.  The MAJCOM ADA Focal Point will provide, at a minimum, monthly status updates to  SAF/FMFA  for  all  on-going  preliminary  reviews  and  formal  ADA  investigations.    The status update includes detailed information on case progress and estimated completion dates, for each open case. 5.23.2.  If  the  investigation  is  proceeding,  as  planned,  and  the  MAJCOM  ADA  Focal  Point anticipates the ADA Report (including the legal sufficiency review) be mailed to SAF/FMFA AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   31  on-time (before the required due date), then state this as the update and provide completion dates for each stage of the investigation (i.e., the date the PRR/ADA Report was completed, the  date  the  PRR/ADA  Report  was  provided  to  the  Appointing  Official’s  SJA  or  legal servicing  office,  the  date  the  legal  sufficiency  review  was  completed,  the  date  that  each responsible individual responded to the formal ADA Report, the date the final package was mailed to SAF/FMFA, etc.). 5.23.3.  If the ADA Report is not completed by the suspense date, or if the MAJCOM ADA Focal Point becomes aware that the ADA report cannot be transmitted to SAF/FMFA before the suspense date, then state this as the update and provide the estimated completion dates for each  stage  of  the  investigation  (i.e.,  the  estimated  date  the  PRR/ADA  Report  is  to  be completed,  the  estimated  date  the  PRR/ADA  Report  is  to  be  provided  to  the  Appointing Official’s SJA or legal servicing office, the estimated date the legal sufficiency review is to be completed, the estimated date that each responsible individual responds to the PRR/ADA Report, the estimated date the final package is to be transmitted to SAF/FMFA, etc.). 5.23.4.  SAF/FMFA  is  required  to  submit  a  detailed,  ADA  status  report  for  formal investigations  to  OUSD(C)  each  month;  therefore,  the  MAJCOM  ADA  Focal  Point  must provide the monthly status update, via e-mail, no later than the second-to-last working day of each month.   32  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 6 INTERAGENCY ADA INVESTIGATIONS  6.1.

The need for this preliminary review is based on allegations that personnel used FY2000 funds to cover FY2001 expenses for the 2001 Symposium. Consequently, this could be a violation of the Time Limitation Statute (Title 31, U.S.C. § 1502), which in turn could lead to a violation of the Antideficiency Act (Title 31, U.S.C. §1341). Further, personnel may also have violated the Miscellaneous Receipts Statute (Title 31 U.S.C. § 3302(b)) by failing to deposit funds collected in FY2000 into the United States Treasury.  We have assigned control number P11-50 to your preliminary ADA review and you should use this control number in all your correspondences.  Starting 21 May 2002, you have 90 calendar days to complete and forward the preliminary review report (PRR).  Accordingly, 19 August 2002 is the suspense date for submitting the PRR to SAF/FMFA for review and coordination.  Please refer to Chapter 4 of Air Force Instruction 65-608, Antideficiency Act Violations, 18 March 2005, for instructions on performing the preliminary review.  (Note:  The instruction is available at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI65-608.pdf).  If the Preliminary Review Officer determines that no violations exist and your legal personnel agree, this case will likely be closed.  Additional reporting requirements and milestones will be provided if a formal ADA investigation is necessary.  Please  update  Attachment  2  and  forward  it  to  SAF/FMFAS  by  20  June  2002.    Additionally, please  ensure  that  your  review  follows  and  incorporates  the  checklist  in  Attachment  2.    If  you  have questions,  please  contact  the  FMFA  ADA  Team  at  DSN  612-5210,  or  via  e-mail  at  usaf.jbanafw.saf-fm.mbx.saf-FMFas-ada-workflow@mail.mil  Director, Accounting & Reporting Financial Operations (Financial Management) Attachments: 1.

The need for this preliminary review is based on an internal review of questionable obligations that identified a potential violation of 31 U.S.C. Section 1301.  FY2010 O&M funds were used to obligate support services performed in FY20XX.  The purpose of the preliminary review is to determine if a potential ADA violation occurred at HQ AFABC.  If the research results determine no violation exists and the HQ AFXYZ/JAQ legal review agrees this case will be closed.  2.  Please incorporate your findings and conclusions, as well as supporting documentary evidence, into a written draft Preliminary Review Report (PRR).  The format for this report may be found in AFI 65-608, Antideficiency Act Violations.  Moreover, DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14, in conjunction with AFI 65-608, establishes procedures for identifying, investigating, and reporting ADA violations.

You are appointed to conduct a formal investigation of potential violations of the Antideficiency Act (ADA) in accordance with DoD Financial Management Regulation (DoD FMR) 7000.14-R, Volume 14.  An internal HQ AFABC/FM review identified questionable obligations that might lead to a potential violation of 31 U.S.C. Section 1301.  FY2010 O&M funds were used to obligate $999,999.99 in support services that were performed in FY2011.  The preliminary review officer (PRO), in his report, determined FY2010 O&M (3400) funds were used to obligate support services that should have been funded with FY2011 3400 funds.  FY2011 3400 funds were not available at the appropriate administrative subdivision to execute an accounting correction, creating a potential violation of 31 U.S.C. Section 1341 (a)(1)(B).  The events described above require AFXYZ to appoint an investigating officer to complete a formal investigation.  Your findings and conclusions as well as supporting testimony and other documentary evidence are to be incorporated into a written ADA Report.  The format for this report can be found in AFI 65-608.  DoD FMR 7000.14-R, Volume 14, in conjunction with AFI 65-608, establishes procedures for identifying, investigating, reporting and processing ADA violations.  Volume 14, Ch 5 includes a checklist for appointing officials and investigating officers, ADA investigation reporting instructions and a sample ADA Report format.

A  ADA INVESTIGATING OFFICER TRAINING The DoD and Air Force policy require all appointed investigating officers receive the ADA Investigating Officer Training Course and certify their completion of this training before they begin an investigation, and include a copy of the training certification as an attachment to their ADA Report.  SAF/FM sponsored the development of an Antideficiency Act (ADA) Investigating Officer Training course that delivers training to individuals designated as ADA investigating officers and preliminary review officers.  The training focuses on (1) identifying and documenting the facts, circumstances, and causes surrounding the potential ADA violation; (2) taking sworn testimony from individuals having the knowledge of transactions and events surrounding the suspected violation, including the individual(s) identified as potentially responsible; and (3) reporting the investigation results in an ADA Report.  This is a self-administered and self-certifying training course intended to improve the quality and timeliness of ADA investigations.  The ADA Investigating Officer Training Course is located on the FM Distributed Learning site.      (or Civilian Equivalent) is responsible for the ADA violation, please contact SAF/FMFA immediately so that SAF/FMFA can promptly coordinate this issue through SAF/IG.  If during the course of your investigation, you identify that a Senior Official or Colonel The ADA Focal Point will review the Draft ADA Report, including all supporting documentation for completeness, and will forward the report to the SJA for a legal review.  Once the legal review is complete, the responsible individual(s) must have the opportunity to read the report and to provide comments.  The responsible individual’s comments must be addressed by   42  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 the IO in an addendum to the report. The focal point will review the report and addendum, and provide the revised report to the SJA for another review.  If the SJA finds the revised report legally sufficient, the focal point will prepare the transmittal letter for comptroller review and approval, and then transmit the ADA Report package to SAF/FMFA. SAF/FMFA will review the report for completeness and adequacy of facts presented in support of the conclusions reached. Once SAF/FMFA is satisfied with the ADA report, a transmittal letter will be prepared, requesting the SAF/GCA legal review. SAF/GCA will review all ADA Reports and the determinations made within, and will provide a legal sufficiency review.   Once SAF/GCA’s review is complete, SAF/FMFA will forward all case files to OUSD(C). OUSD(C) will review and provide an advance decision, as to whether or not an ADA Violation has occurred.   If OUSD(C) determines that a violation has occurred, the case will be returned to Air Force for consideration of appropriate disciplinary action.  In accordance with applicable laws, regulations and negotiated agreements, a properly designated disciplinary official(s) should consider disciplinary action for individual(s) found responsible for the ADA violation(s).   Upon completion of any disciplinary actions, SAF/FMFA will forward the Final ADA Report for review and coordination to SAF/GCA, and then to OUSD(C) for concurrence and closure.  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   43  Attachment 7 PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION TAKEN DURING WITNESS TESTIMONY Policy:  The Privacy statement is required to be read and acknowledged by each witness at the beginning of the interview process.

JANE DOE  FROM:  HQ AFXYZ/FM    SUBJECT:   Antideficiency Act Violation Case No. F11-50, FY2011 Support Services at HQ AFABC    On 1 March 20XX, HQ AFXYZ appointed me to conduct a formal investigation of a potential violation of the Antideficiency Act (ADA), pursuant to AFI 65-608 and DoD 7000.14-R, Volume 14.  The results of this investigation concluded that a violation of the ADA, in the amount of $999,999.99, occurred because FY2010 O&M (3400) funds were used to obligate support services that should have been funded with FY2011 3400 funds.  FY2011 3400 funds were not available at the appropriate administrative subdivision to execute an accounting correction.  As a result, a violation of 31 U.S.C. Section 1341 (a)(1)(B) occurred.    By law, it is mandatory that the party or parties responsible for this violation be identified, and that any extenuating circumstances are considered prior to a final determination regarding remedial and disciplinary action.  This memorandum is to advise you that you have been identified as a responsible party, in light of your duties as a [xxxxxxxxx ].  You have a right to review the report prior to finalization and to examine evidence on which the determination was based.  A copy of the ADA Violation Report, which contains the facts and circumstances leading to the determination of your responsibility, is attached for your review.  You are entitled to comment on the evidence, which formed the basis for determining responsibility, and to identify any extenuating facts or mitigating circumstances believed to be relevant to your responsibility.  You may also submit a sworn or un-sworn written statement, commenting on the matters set forth in the ADA Violation Report, and designate additional witnesses to testify on your behalf.    Please submit your written statement, or declination to comment in writing, within 10 days of receipt of this memorandum.   You may consult with private legal counsel, at your own expense and, if applicable, a union representative.  You are also hereby advised that upon OUSD(C) approval of this ADA Violation Report, your name will be provided to the President, through OMB, and to the Congress of the United States, as a responsible individual in this ADA violation.  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   45  If you have any questions concerning this matter, please address them to the undersigned at HQ AFXYZ, DSN 345-6789.

Obtain a written Acknowledgement Statement signed by the Disciplinary Official (responsible for determining the appropriate disciplinary action (Attachment 13)) which   54  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 acknowledges that he or she understands that a an ADA violation is a violation of Federal Statute, b) an ADA violation constitutes a misuse of DoD funds even though the misuse may not have been knowing or willful, and despite whether the disciplinary official considers the misuse harmful to DoD or the Air Force; c) the Department is required to report the violation to the President (via the Director, Office of Management and Budget), the U.S. Congress, and to the Government Accountability Office (GAO); d) an unintentional violation does not justify a decision not to administer disciplinary action; and e) disciplinary action shall be commensurate with the severity of the violation, and factors leading to the violation or its resolution may be considered.  13.2. Obtain a written Commensurate Action Statement (Attachment 14) from the Disciplinary Official, which states what type of disciplinary action, if any, was taken and provide documentation of the disciplinary action.  If no action was taken, then explain why.  (The statement must address why he or she believes that the disciplinary action taken, or the failure to take disciplinary action, is commensurate with the severity of the violation.  If there are extenuating circumstances, they must be considered.  In civilian disciplinary actions, the notice of decision letter issued by disciplinary official (otherwise known in civilian personnel as the deciding official) may be used as the Commensurate Action statement, provided it adequately addresses the matters cited above.   _____14. Corrective Action(s) Taken.  State what funds were used to make necessary accounting corrections, such as appropriation, title, and fiscal year.  Provide either the date that the funding correction was posted, or the date that it will be posted, and explains how the funding correction was accomplished (i.e., additional funds received, funds realigned, etc.).  A deferred posting of a corrective entry does not preclude the necessity to report a potential ADA violation.  In addition, state what procedural actions were taken and completed to preclude violations from happening in the future.  This includes improvement of overall and specific policies, procedures, and processes used by the functional areas involved in the violation; revised statutes or regulatory guidance that may have been involved; established or improved internal procedures; and assurance that a similar violation will not occur in the future.  The IO must describe remedial actions, in detail, so they may be evaluated for possible Command-wide application.  The IO must also state what corrective actions were actually taken, or are being taken, to preclude similar violations in the future.  Recommendations for future consideration of installation-level corrective actions are not acceptable. _____15. State whether the administrative control of funds prescribed in DoD FMR Volume 14, Chapter 1 is adequate.  If the official signing the report recommends changes to this chapter, then submit the proposed changes to the OUSD(C) DCFO. _____16. State steps taken to coordinate the report with the other components or agencies involved, when applicable. Specifically, if another DoD Component or another federal agency is involved, make a statement concerning the steps taken to coordinate the report with the other component or agency.  _____17. Provide the name and title of holder of the funds subdivision, and a brief statement of their responsibility in the potential violation.  The identification of the holder of funds must be supported with documentation.  The DoD FMR defines Fund Holder as “an individual holding an administrative subdivision of funds or an operating target, who is responsible for incurring obligations against the administrative subdivision or target and for managing the use of such AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   55  funds.”  Include an evaluation of the performance of the fund holder control responsibilities.  The level of command immediately above the holder will normally furnish this evaluation.  See 2.11 for appropriate information to be included. _____18. Other Areas of Discussion.  This section discusses any other issues that may not have directly caused the potential ADA violation, but are essential in completing the ADA Report.  The IO will obtain, from the Air Force management officials involved, any lessons learned from the violation, for use by others in addressing similar circumstances.            56  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015         _______________________________ Investigating Officer Name   _______________________________ Investigating Officer Signature     ________________________________ ADA Focal Point Name   ________________________________ ADA Focal Point Signature   AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015   57         ________________________________ SAF/FMFA Reviewer Name  ________________________________ SAF/FMFA Reviewer Signature    58  AFI65-608  29 DECEMBER 2015 Attachment 11 SAMPLE COMPTROLLER TRANSMITTAL OF ADA REPORT MEMORANDUM Street Address, Room Number   City, State, Zip MEMORANDUM FOR SAF/FMF   FROM:  HQ AFXYZ/FM    SUBJECT: Transmittal, Antideficiency Act ADA Violation Report and Legal Review, Case Number F11-50   1.
