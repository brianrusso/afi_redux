This  directive  establishes  the framework for Air Force PA operations and applies to all Air Force organizations including the Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard.

It reflects the merger of the PA and visual information career fields; transfer of Air Force News Agency capabilities to the  Defense  Media  Activity  (DMA)  as  mandated  by  the  2005  Base  Realignment  and  Closure Commission; and stand-up of the Air Force Public Affairs Agency for centralized PA support. 1.    The  Air  Force  conducts  comprehensive,  active  communication  programs  at  all  levels  of command—in  garrison  and  while  deployed—to  provide  Airmen  and  their  families,  Congress, and  the  public  timely,  factual  and  accurate  DoD  and  Air  Force  information  that  contributes  to awareness  and understanding of the Air Force mission. This  directive conveys the policies that enable commanders and PA personnel to conduct these programs. 1.1.  The  Air  Force  will  respond  to  requests  for  releasable  information  and  material.    To maintain  credibility  of  all  communications,  it  is  Air  Force  policy  that  commanders  at  all levels will ensure a free flow of information in a timely and responsive manner. 1.1.1.  Review of information proposed for public release will be delegated to the lowest echelon  competent  to  evaluate  the  content  and  predict  implications  of  releasing  the information,  ensuring  it  is  not  classified  and  does  not  conflict  with  established government policies or programs. 1.1.2.  Propaganda,  disinformation  or  activities  intended  to  misinform,  mislead  or  deny otherwise releasable information will not be practiced in any PA program. 1.2.  The Air Force will develop and maintain cooperative and responsive relations with the public  and  media.  To  foster  public  trust  and  support,  Airmen  and  their  families  are encouraged to be active in their communities and participate in service organizations. 1.3.  Air  Force  command  information  programs  will  be  planned  and  executed  to  increase awareness  and  understanding  of  the  mission,  policies,  priorities  and  programs;  inform Airmen  of  developments  affecting  them;  educate  Airmen  and  families  about  the  need  to protect sensitive information; and provide avenues for feedback. 1.4.  The Air Force will collect, preserve and accession visual information products to meet operational, informational, training, research, legal, historical and administrative needs. 1.5.  The Air Force will organize, train and equip its bands to foster sustained public trust and support,  provide  precise  ceremonial  engagement,  sustain  warfighter  morale,  build partnerships, foster military pride, patriotism and service, and recruit talented Airmen — in public, garrison and while deployed. 2.  This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities: 2.1.  The  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Office  of  Public  Affairs  (SAF/PA)  is responsible  for  policy,  resource  advocacy  and  oversight  of  Air  Force  PA  programs.

They  will  also  initiate,  manage  and  evaluate  PA  programs  for  their  command’s assigned organizations and units. 2.6.
