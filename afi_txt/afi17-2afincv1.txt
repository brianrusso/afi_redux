Be responsible for monitoring and completing all training requirements. (T-3) 1.3.5.2.  Ensure  they  participate  only  in  operational  activities  for  which  they  are qualified/certified, current, and prepared. (T-3) 1.4.  Training  .  Cybercrew  training  is  designed  to  progress  an  individual  from  Initial Qualification  Training  (IQT),  through  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT),  to  annual Continuation  Training  (CT).  Requalification  training  (RT),  upgrade  training,  and  instructor training are additional training requirements for AFINC employment. 1.4.1.  Initial Qualification Training (IQT). Training needed to qualify for basic crewmember duties in an assigned crew position for a specific weapon system, without regard to the unit’s operational mission. See Chapter 2. (T-3) 1.4.2.  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT).  The  purpose  of  MQT  is  to  qualify crewmembers in assigned crew positions to perform the command or unit mission IAW the unit’s DOC statement. See Chapter 3. (T-3) 1.4.3.  Continuation  Training  (CT).  The  CT  program  provides  crewmembers  with  the volume,  frequency,  and  mix  of  training  necessary  to  maintain  proficiency  in  the  assigned certification/qualification level. 1.4.3.1.  Ready  Cybercrew  Program  (RCP).  RCP  is  the  CT  program  designed  to  focus training  on  capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit’s  core  tasked  missions  and  fulfill DOC statement mission requirements. Upon completion of IQT and MQT, crewmembers will  have  received  training  in  all  the  basic  mission-sets  of  the  unit.  After  MQT 8 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 completion, crewmembers will then be assigned  to  a MR or BMC crew  position within the  unit  and  maintain  the  appropriate  level  of  proficiency  and  currency  per  the  RCP tasking memorandum. (T-3) 1.4.4.  Requalification  Training  (RT).  RT  is  designed  to  provide  the  training  necessary  to requalify  a  crewmembers  member  with  an  expired  qualification  evaluation  or  loss  of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in Chapter 4). (T-3) 1.4.5.  Mission  Ready  (MR).  A  crewmember  who  satisfactorily  completed  IQT  and  MQT, and maintains qualification and proficiency in the unit mission. 1.4.5.1.  All  CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z designated positions will maintain certification/qualification status.  The OG/CC may require other Cybercrew Position Indicator (CPI)-6/B positions not  assigned  to  the  squadron  to  be  certified/qualified.  See  Attachment  4  for  CPI explanation and definitions. (T-3) 1.4.5.2.  MR crewmembers will maintain currencies that affect MR status, accomplish all core designated training (missions and events), and all mission related training. Failure to complete required MR training or maintain currencies will result in regression to BMC. Failure  of  an  MR  crewmember  to  maintain  BMC  currencies  will  result  in  regression  to non-MR (NMR) status. MR crewmembers, regressed to BMC, may perform missions and events in which they are certified at the discretion of the SQ/CC. (T-3) 1.4.6.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A crewmember who satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, is qualified in some aspect of the unit mission, but does not maintain MR status. The crewmember  must  be  able  to  attain  full  MR  status  as  specified  in  MAJCOM-provided guidance. (T-3) 1.4.6.1.  BMC-coded  positions  are  assigned  to  crewmembers  with  the  primary  job  of performing  wing  supervision  or  staff  functions  that  directly  support  cyber  operations (e.g., numbered air force staff, wing staff, OSS personnel, etc.). (T-3) 1.4.6.2.  Active  Duty  BMC  crewmembers  and  activated  ARC  BMC  crewmembers  must be  able  to  attain  MR  status  and,  if  required,  certification/qualification  in  30  days (respectively).  (T-2) 1.4.6.3.  BMC  crewmembers  accomplish  all  mission  related  training  designated  by  the RTM.  (T-2) 1.4.6.4.  BMC crewmembers may participate in any real-world mission in which they are current,  proficient,  and  certified/qualified,  without  any  additional  training,  with  the supervision of an instructor as determined by the SQ/CC.  (T-3) 1.4.6.5.  Failure to complete required BMC training will result in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will determine missions the crewmembers may perform and ensure an instructor supervises the member during real-world mission. (T-3) 1.5.  Training Concepts and Policies: 1.5.1.  Units  will  design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  readiness consistent with  safety and resource availability.  Training must balance the need  for realism against  the  expected  threat,  crew  capabilities,  and  safety.  This  volume  provides  training AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 9 guidelines and polices for use with operational procedures specified in applicable operational publications. 1.5.2.  Design  training  to  achieve  mission  capability  in  squadron-tasked  roles,  maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RCP training missions should emphasize  either  live  network  operations  or  training  scenarios  that  reflect  procedures  and operations  based  on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition capabilities. Use of Tactics, Tips and Procedures (TTP’s) applicable to mission scenarios are desired. (T-2) 1.5.3.  Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to  accomplish  the  required  training.  An  instructor  is  required  if  mission  objectives  include introduction  to  new  or  modified  tasks  and/or  instruction  to  correct  previous  discrepancies. (T-3) 1.6.  Experienced Crewmember Requirements.  AFINC operators are declared experienced on the weapon system when they meet the requirements in Table 1.1. (T-3)   10 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 Table 1.1.  Experienced Crewmember Requirements (T-3).

SMQ experience = Operator (360 hours) + SMQ (e.g., 300 hours) 1.7.  RCP Policy and Management: 1.7.1.  The  RCP  training  cycle  is  12  months  in  duration,  begins  each  fiscal  year  and  is executed IAW the RTM. Each RCP status (i.e., MR or BMC) is defined by a total number of RCP  missions,  events,  and  associated  currencies  determined  by  HHQ  guidance  and  unit commanders. (T-3) 1.7.2.  Total  number  of  missions  and  events  for  MR  or  BMC  is  the  primary  factor  for maintaining an individual's RCP status. Failure to accomplish all training requirements may lead to an individual’s regression by the SQ/CC, IAW HHQ guidance. (T-3) 1.7.3.  Logging  of  an  effective  RCP  mission  requires  accomplishing  a  tactical  mission  or training mission, and completion of the RCP mission/events. (T-3) 1.7.4.  For RCP, non-effective sorties  are logged and reported  when  a sortie is  planned  and started,  but  a  majority  of  valid  training  for  that  type  of  mission  is  not  accomplished  due  to system malfunction, power failures, etc. (T-3) AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 11 1.7.5.  Progression from BMC to MR requires:  (T-2) 1.7.5.1.  A 1-month lookback at the MR mission rate. (T-3) 1.7.5.2.  Certification/qualification in all core missions and events required at MR. (T-3) 1.7.5.3.  Confirmation the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of mission and event requirements remaining at MR by the end of the training cycle. (T-3) 1.7.5.4.  Completion  of  mission-related  training,  to  include  a  current  certification  as applicable to the assigned unit’s Designated Operational Capability (DOC) statement. (T-3) 1.7.6.  MR  and  BMC  crewmember  will  complete  the  required  monthly  mission  rate.  If unable, refer to Regression, paragraph 4.9.  (T-3) 1.7.7.  End of cycle training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level, as outlined in paragraph 1.7, on the last day of the current training cycle. (T-3) 1.8.  Training Mission Program Development: 1.8.1.  RTM  MR  or  BMC  mission  and  event  requirements  apply  to  all  MR  and  BMC crewmembers,  as  well  as  those  carrying  special  mission  certifications/qualifications  (see Attachment 2). The standard mission requirements listed in the RTM establish the minimum number of missions per training cycle for MR and BMC levels of training. The RTM takes precedence  over  this  volume  and  may  contain  updated  requirements,  missions,  events,  or tasks not yet incorporated into Attachment 2. The RTM applies to all AFINC crewmembers. (T-3) 1.9.  Training Records and Reports: 1.9.1.  Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW: 1.9.1.1.  AFI 17-202V1 1.9.1.2.  AFI 17-202V2, Cybercrew Standardization & Evaluation 1.9.1.3.  Any additional Higher Headquarter (HHQ) supplement to the above mentioned volumes. 1.9.2.  Track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable): 1.9.2.1.  Mission-related  training  (e.g.,  tactics  training,  crew  resource  management training, etc.). (T-3) 1.9.2.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  mission  types,  and events cumulatively for the training cycle. (T-3) 1.9.2.3.  RCP  mission  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  1-month  and  3-month running totals for lookback commensurate with CT status (MR or BMC). (T-3) 1.9.2.3.1.  One-Month Sortie Lookback: Total individual RCP sorties that are tracked for  a  30-day  time  period.  This  lookback  is  used  to  assess  individual  progress  in achieving the Total Sorties (minimum) required for the 12-month training cycle. (T-3) 12 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 1.9.2.3.2.  Three-Month Sortie  Lookback:  This  lookback is  used to  assess individual progress in achieving the Total Sorties (minimum) required for the 12-month training cycle. (T-3) 1.9.2.3.3.  ARC will use 3 month lookbacks. (T-3) 1.10.  Crewmember Utilization Policy: 1.10.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  wing/group  crewmember  (CPI-1/-2/-A)  fill  authorized positions  IAW  Unit  Manning  Documents  (UMD)  and  that  crewmember  status  is  properly designated (see Attachment  4 for CPI explanation and definitions). The overall objective is for crewmembers to perform mission-related duties. Supervisors may assign crewmember to valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  operational  review  board  (ORB),  etc.,)  but  must continually  weigh  the  factors  involved,  such  as  level  of  crewmember  tasking,  proficiency, currency,  and  experience.  For  inexperienced  crewmember  in  the  first  year  of  their  initial operational  assignment,  supervisors  should  limit  non-crew  duties  to  those  related  to  unit mission activities.  (T-3) 1.11.  Sortie Allocation and Unit Manpower Guidance: 1.11.1.  In  general,  an  inexperienced  CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z  crewmember  should  receive  priority over experienced crewmember. (T-3) 1.11.2.  There  is  no  maximum  sortie  requirement  for  MR  crewmember.  The  RCP  Tasking Memorandum  (RTM)  defines  the  minimum  sortie  requirements  for  crewmembers  per training cycle. (T-3) 1.12.  Training  on  Operational  Missions.  Unless  specifically  prohibited  or  restricted  by weapons  system  operating  procedures,  specific  theater  operations  order  (OPORD),  or  specific higher-headquarter  (HHQ)  guidance,  the  OG/CC  exercising  operational  control  may  approve upgrade,  certification/qualification,  or  special  certification/qualification  training  on  operational missions.

(T-2) AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 17 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  MQT  is  a  unit-developed  training  program  that  upgrades  IQT-complete crewmember to BMC or MR status to accomplish the unit DOC statement missions. Guidance in this  chapter,  which  represents  the  minimum,  is  provided  to  assist  SQ/CCs  in  developing  their MQT  program,  which  must  have  OG/CC  approval  prior  to  use.  Squadrons  may  further  tailor their  program  for  individual  crewmember,  based  on  current  qualifications  (e.g.,  USAFWS graduate,  Instructor),  certifications  (e.g.,  MC,  DCC,  Stan/Eval),  experience,  currency, documented performance, and formal training. Squadrons may use applicable portions of MQT to create a recertification program for crewmember that have regressed from MR to BMC status. (T-3) 3.1.1.  MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days (180 days for ARC) starting from the day  after  completion  of  IQT  or  the  crewmember’s  first  duty  day  in  the  gaining  unit  if  IQT was completed prior to arrival. If the crewmember elects to take leave prior to being entered into MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the leave. Training is complete upon SQ/CC  certification  of  MR  or  BMC  status  (subsequent  to  the  successful  completion  of  the MQT  MSN  qualification  evaluation).  Notify  MAJCOM/A3T  (through  MAJCOM/A3TT  or equivalent)  either  if  training  exceed  the  90-day  time  period  or  there  is  a  delay  beginning MQT (e.g., due to security clearance) that exceeds 30 days (90 days for ARC). (T-3) 3.2.  Mission-Related Training: 3.2.1.  Units  will  develop  blocks  of  instruction  covering  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission  as determined by the SQ/CC. Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this requirement. (T-3) 3.2.2.  Mission-related training may be tailored to the individual's background and experience or  particular  local  conditions.  Current  and  available  reference  materials,  such  as  AFTTP  3-1.AFINC,  other  applicable  AFTTP  3-1s  and  3-3s,  unit  guides,  and  other  available  training material and programs, will be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible.

(T-3) 18 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 3.3.  Initial Certification: 3.3.1.  Initial  Certification  of  MR  crewmembers  will  be  completed  within  30  days  after completing MQT (recommended, but not required for BMC crewmember). Failure to comply will result in regression to NMR until complete. Suggested briefing guides are at Attachment 3. (T-3) 3.4.  Mission Training: 3.4.1.  Supervision.  A  squadron  instructor  is  required  for  all  training  missions  unless specified otherwise. (T-3) 3.4.2.  Minimum  Sortie  Requirements.  The  minimum  sorties  required  in  a  local  MQT program will be IAW the MQT course syllabus (not required if portions of the MQT program are  used  to  recertify  crewmembers  that  have  regressed  from  MR  to  BMC).  Reference  the paragraphs  below  for  further  details  and  recommended  sortie  flows  the  SQ/CC  may  use  to develop the unit's MQT program. (T-3) 3.4.3.  Mission  sequence  and  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  appropriate  unit  MQT  course syllabus (unless waived).  (T-2) 3.4.4.  Mission Objectives: Be familiar with local area requirements and procedures. Specific Mission Tasks: local area familiarization, emergency procedures, and other tasks determined by the unit. (T-3) 3.4.5.  Individual events may be accomplished anytime during MQT, however all events will be accomplished prior to SQ/CC certification of MR or BMC status.  (T-3) 3.4.6.  Mission Types. AFINC mission types are defined in current SPINS. 3.4.6.1.  Reference standing SPINS for mission type definitions. 3.4.7.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  syllabus.  Failure  to complete training within the specified time limit requires notification through channels to the MAJCOM/A3T  with  crewmember’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  delay,  planned  actions,  and estimated completion date. (T-2) 3.4.8.  Crewmembers in MQT will train under the appropriate supervision as annotated in the formal course syllabus until completing the qualification evaluation. (T-3) 3.4.9.  Formal  course  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for IQT. However, additional training events, based on student proficiency and background, may be incorporated into the IQT program with SQ/CC authorization. Additional training due to student non-progression is available within the constraints of the formal course syllabus and may be added at SQ/CC discretion. (T-3) 3.5.  MQT for Senior Officers: 3.5.1.  All  senior  officer  training  (colonel  selects  and  above)  will  be  conducted  at  the  unit. (T-2) 3.5.2.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived by the MAJCOM/A3. (T-2) AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 19 3.5.3.  Senior  officers  will  be  considered  in  a  formal  training  status  for  the  duration  of  the course.  Their  duties  will  be  turned  over  to  appropriate  CDs  or  CVs  until  training  is completed. Waiver authority for this paragraph is the MAJCOM/CC (submitted through the MAJCOM/A3). (T-2) 3.6.  Difference Training.  When Difference Training is required, DOT will need to update IQT and MQT and provide training to all crewmembers. Training will be documented IAW AFI 17-202V1.  Difference  Training  does  not  disqualify  members  from  MR  status.  However,  all untrained members cannot perform tasks associated with the new guidance until trained, unless under  the  supervision  of  an  instructor/evaluator.  New  training  and  procedures  should  be reviewed immediately following the initial training session and updated; then updated a second time by end of the following quarter.  (T-2) 20 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  crewmember  training  requirements  to maintain  MR  or  BMC  status  for  an  assigned  training  status.  The  SQ/CC  will  ensure  each crewmember receives sufficient training to maintain individual proficiency (T-3). 4.2.  Crewmember  Status.  SQ/CCs  will  assign  AFINC  crewmembers  a  status  using  the following criteria: 4.2.1.  Mission  Ready  (MR).  For  SORTS,  a  crewmember  member  who  satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, and maintains qualification, certification, currency and proficiency in the command or unit operational mission. 4.2.1.1.  The  crewmember  shall  be  able  to  attain  full  unit  mission  certification  to  meet operational tasking within 30 days.  (T-2) 4.2.2.  Non-Mission  Ready  (NMR).  A  crewmember  that  is  unqualified,  non-current  or incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. (T-3) 4.2.3.  MR and BMC crewmembers will accomplish and/or maintain RCP requirements, for their respective status, and the appropriate events in the RCP tables in this Instruction and the RTM. (T-3) 4.2.4.  Operators will maintain all required certifications to operate on the network or will be subject to decertification if those requirements are not met. (T-3) 4.3.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  training  events  identifiers  and  descriptions  are located in Attachment 2. Units will include unit-specific events comprising a description in their local training documentation. (T-3) 4.3.1.  Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit events accomplished on training, operational missions and satisfactory evaluations or certifications toward RCP requirements and establish a subsequent due date. Use the date of successful evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all mission-related training events that were trained during a formal course. A successful evaluation establishes a new current and qualified reference date for all accomplished events. For IQT or requalification training, numbers of events accomplished prior to the evaluation are  not  credited  to  any  crew  position.  In  all  cases,  numbers  of  events  successfully accomplished during the evaluation or certification are credited toward the crew position. (T-3) 4.3.2.  For an unsatisfactory evaluation, do not log CT requirements for those events graded U/Q3 (according to AFI 17-202V2) until re-qualified. (T-3) 4.3.3.  Instructors and evaluators may credit up to 50 percent of their total CT requirements while instructing or evaluating. (T-3)   AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 21 4.4.  Continuation  Training  Requirements.  Completion and tracking of  continuation training is  ultimately  the  responsibility  of  the  individual  crewmember.  Crewmembers  should  actively work  with  their  supervisors,  unit  schedulers  and  training  offices  to  ensure  accomplishment  of their  continuation  training  requirements.  Crewmembers  attached  to  units  are  responsible  for reporting accomplished training event to their attached unit. (T-3) 4.4.1.  Mission-Related  Training  Events.  Crewmembers  will  comply  with  requirements  of Table 4.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to NMR status.  (T-3) 4.4.1.1.  Weapons  and  Tactics  Academic  Training.  Units  will  establish  a  weapons  and tactics  academic  training  program  to  satisfy  MQT  and  CT  requirements.  Training  is required semi-annually during each training cycle. SQ/CCs will provide guidance to unit weapons shops to ensure all crewmember are informed/reminded of new/current AFINC systems, and mission-specific TTP.  (T-3) 4.4.1.1.1.  Academic instructors will be Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) graduates or have attended the applicable academic portion(s) of school, if possible. (T-3) 4.4.1.1.2.  Instruction should include (as applicable), but is not limited to:  (T-3) 4.4.1.1.2.1.  Applicable AF Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (AFTTP) 3-1 & 3-3  series  publications,  AFI  17-2,  Air  Force  Intranet  Network  Control  (AFINC) Operations  and  Procedures,  Volume  3  (AFI  17-2  AFNICV3)  and  other documents pertaining to the execution of the unit’s mission. (T-3) 4.4.1.1.2.2.  Specialized  training  to  support  specific  weapons,  tactics,  mission capabilities, rules of engagement (ROE), and other mission related activities. (T-3) 4.4.1.2.  Risk  Management  (RM).  Crewmember  will  participate  in  RM  training  once every training cycle. Briefings will include the concepts outlined in AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management  (RM)  Guidelines  and  Tools.  RM  training  will  be  tracked.  Failure  to complete RM training will result in NMR status. (T-3) Table 4.1.  AFINC Crewmember Mission-Related CT Requirements. (T-3). Code Event GTR001  Weapons & Tactics   Position Frequency All  179d  Notes 1, 2  GTR003  Risk Management Notes:  1. “d” is the maximum number of days between events. 2. Failure to complete this event within the time prescribed leads to NMR status. Crewmembers will  not  be  able  to  accomplish  unsupervised  crew  duties  until  the  delinquent  event  is accomplished or waived.  365d All 1, 2 4.4.2.  Mission  Training  Events.  Crewmembers  will  comply  with  requirements  of  the  RCP Tasking  Memorandum  (RTM)  for  their  respective  position.  Total  sorties  and  events  are minimums which ensure training to continually meet all DOC tasked requirements and may not be reduced except in proration/waiver. Unless specifically noted the OG/CC is the waiver 22 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 authority for all RCP requirements and for all provisions in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of this volume. Failure to accomplish events in these tables may lead to NMR status. (T-3) 4.5.  Specialized  Mission  Training.  Specialized  Mission  Training  is  any  special  skills necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit's  assigned  mission  that  is  not  required  by  every  crewmember member.  Specialized  Mission  Training  consists  of  upgrade  training  such  as  special  mission qualification (SMQ), instructor upgrade, etc. Specialized training is normally accomplished after a crewmember is assigned MR or BMC status. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers in MR or  BMC  positions  may  hold  special  mission  certifications  as  long  as  additional  training requirements are accomplished. (See Chapter 5) (T-3) 4.5.1.  The  SQ/CC  will  determine  which  crewmembers  will  train  for  and  maintain  special mission qualifications and certifications. (T-3) 4.6.  Currencies, Recurrencies and Requalification. 4.6.1.  Currency. The RTM defines currency requirements for MR and BMC crewmembers. Crewmembers  may  not  instruct,  evaluate  or  perform  any  event  in  which  they  are  not qualified  and  current  unless  under  instructor  supervision.  Currency  may  be  established  or updated by: 4.6.1.1.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  provided  member’s currency has not expired. (T-3) 4.6.1.2.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  under  supervision  of  a current instructor. (T-3) 4.6.1.3.  Events  satisfactorily  performed  on  any  evaluation  may  be  used  to  establish  or update currency in that event. (T-3) 4.6.1.4.  If a crewmember loses a currency, thereby requiring recurrency, that mission or event  may  not  be  performed  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining  currency.  Non-current events  must  be  satisfied  before  the  crewmember  is  considered  certified/qualified  (as applicable) to perform those events unsupervised. Loss of currencies affecting MR status will require regression to BMC (see paragraph 4.9); loss of currencies not affecting MR status does not require regression.  (T-3) 4.7.  Loss  of  Instructor  Status  and  Requalification/Recurrency.  Instructors  may  lose instructor status for the following: 4.7.1.  Loss of currency for greater than 180 days. (T-3) 4.7.2.  They  become  noncurrent  in  a  mission  or  event  which  causes  removal  from  MR  or BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require complete decertification (but not a complete loss of qualification). (T-3) 4.7.3.  As  long  as  the  affected  crewmember  retains  instructor  qualification  IAW  AFI  17-202V2, recertification will be at the SQ/CC’s discretion. (T-3) 4.7.3.1.  If  the  SQ/CC  does  not  elect  to  decertify  the  individual  or  if  the  individual becomes  noncurrent  in  missions  or  events  which  do  not  require  removal  from  MR  or BMC  status,  instructor  status  may  be  retained,  but  the  instructor  will  not  instruct  that mission or event until the required currency is regained. (T-3) AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 23 4.7.4.  Instructor  Lack  of  Ability.  Instructors  serve  solely  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC. Instructors should exemplify a higher level of performance and present themselves as reliable and authoritative experts in their respective duty positions. Instructors exhibiting substandard performance should be reviewed for suitability of continued instructor duty. Instructors will be decertified if: 4.7.4.1.  Awarded an unsatisfactory grade in any area of the evaluation. (T-3) 4.7.4.2.  Failure of a qualification. (T-3) 4.7.4.3.  SQ/CC  deems  instructor  is  substandard,  ineffective,  or  providing  incorrect procedures, techniques, or policy guidance. (T-3) 4.7.4.4.  Decertified  instructors  may  regain  instructor  status  by  correcting  applicable deficiency and completing the training and/or evaluation as specified by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.8.  Regression. 4.8.1.  MR or BMC Regression for  Failure to  Meet  Lookback. Only RCP training missions and  cyberspace  operations  sorties  may  be  used  for  lookback.  If  the  crewmember  does  not meet  lookback  requirements  throughout  the  training  cycle,  SQ/CC  can  regress  the crewmember from MR to BMC or NMR.  (T-3) 4.8.1.1.  Failure  to  meet  3  month  lookback  requires  a  review  of  the  crewmember’s  3-month sortie history. If the 3-month lookback was met, the crewmember may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain in MR or BMC status. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in regression to BMC or NMR/N-BMC, as applicable, or the crewmember may be placed in  supervised  status  at  the  SQ/CC's  discretion.  If  probation  is  chosen,  the  only  way  to remove a crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is to reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation period (not applicable to ARC).  (T-3) 4.8.1.2.  Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The crewmember must maintain 1-month lookback until a 3-month lookback is possible (not applicable to ARC).  SQ/CCs  may  apply  supervisory  rules  as  described  in  paragraph  4.9.1.1  if  a  new MR or BMC crewmember fails to meet currency and proficiency requirements during the 1-month  lookback  while  establishing  3-month  lookback.  In  addition,  1-month  lookback will start the first full month of MR or BMC status.  (T-3) 4.8.2.  Regression  for  Failed  Evaluations.  Crewmembers  who  fail  a  periodic  evaluation  are unqualified  and  will  regress  to  NMR  as  applicable.  Crewmembers  will  remain  NMR  until successfully completing required corrective action, re-evaluation, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC.  (T-3) 4.8.3.  Failure  to  Maintain  Standards.    If  a  qualified  crewmember  demonstrates  lack  of proficiency  or  knowledge  the  SQ/CC  may  elect  to  regress  the  individual  to  NMR  as applicable. These crewmembers will remain NMR until successful completion of corrective action  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC,  an  evaluation  if  required  and  are  re-certified  by  the SQ/CC.  (T-3)  24 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 4.9.  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  Crewmembers  who  fail  to  complete  mission  or  event requirements by the end of training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and  magnitude  of  the  deficiency.  Refer  to  paragraph  4.11  for  proration  guidance.  In  all  cases, units will report training shortfalls to the OG/CC. (T-3) 4.9.1.  Crewmembers  failing  to  meet  annual  RCP  events  or  minimum  total  sortie requirements may continue CT at MR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if additional training is required. (T-3) 4.9.2.  Failure to meet specific MR or BMC mission type requirements will result in one of the following:  (T-3) 4.9.2.1.  Regression  to  NMR  if  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  mission  type  deficiency  is significant.  To  regain  MR  or  BMC  status,  the  crewmember  will  complete  all  deficient mission types. These missions may also be counted toward the total requirements for the new training cycle. (T-3) 4.9.2.2.  Continuation  at  MR  or  BMC  status  if  total  RCP  missions  and  lookback  are maintained and the mission type deficiencies are deemed insignificant by the SQ/CC. The SQ/CC will determine if any additional training is required to address shortfall. (T-3) 4.9.3.  Failure  to  accomplish  missions/events  required  for  Special  Mission  capabilities  or certifications/qualifications  will  result  in  loss  of  that  certification/qualification.  The  SQ/CC will  determine  recertification  requirements.  Requalification  requirements  are  IAW  AFI  17-202V2 applicable HHQ guidance, and AFI 17-2AFINCv2. (T-3) 4.10.  Proration of Training. 4.10.1.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements.  At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC may prorate any training requirements precluded by the following events: initial arrival date in  squadron,  emergency  leave,  non-mission  TDYs,  exercises,  or  deployments.  Ordinary annual leave will not be considered as non-availability. Other extenuating circumstances, as determined by the SQ/CC,  that prevent the crewmember from mission duties for more than 15  consecutive  days  may  be  considered  as  non-availability  for  proration  purposes.  The following guidelines apply: 4.10.1.1.  Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies. 4.10.1.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for mission duties in the training cycle. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of cumulative non-mission duty calendar days. (T-3) 4.10.1.3.  If MQT is re-accomplished, a crewmember’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share following completion of MQT. (T-3) 4.10.1.4.  No  requirement  may  be  prorated  below  one.  Prorated  numbers  resulting  in fractions  of  less  than  0.5  will  be  rounded  to  the  next  lower  whole  number  (one  or greater). (T-3) 4.10.1.5.  Newly  assigned  crewmembers  achieving  MR  or  BMC  status  after  the  15th  of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes. A prorated share of RCP missions must be completed in CT. (T-3) AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 25 4.10.1.6.  A  crewmember’s  last  month  on  station  prior  to  PCSing  may  be  prorated provided 1 month's proration is not exceeded. Individuals PCSing may be considered MR for reporting purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last mission/sortie, or until loss of MR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first. (T-3) 4.10.1.7.  Activated  ARC  members  on  orders  for  30  consecutive  days  or  greater,  will maintain  active  duty  proficiencies  and  currency  requirements  prorated  for  the  duration they are on orders. (T-3) 4.11.  Operational  Missions.  The  following  procedures  are  intended  to  provide  flexibility  in accomplishing  the  unit's  CT  program.  Sorties  conducted  during  operational  missions  will  be logged.  These  sorties  count  toward  annual  RCP  requirements  and  will  be  used  for  lookback purposes.  Operational  missions  and  events  may  be  used  to  update  proficiency/currency requirements if they meet the criteria in Attachment 2. (T-3) 4.11.1.  Example:  Capt  Jones  was  granted  17  days  of  emergency  leave  in  January  and attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. The SQ/CC  authorized  a  total  of  two  months  proration  from  his  training  cycle  (two  months  for the 73 cumulative days of non-availability). Table 4.2.  Proration Allowance. (T-3).

Regaining MR or BMC Status. 4.12.1.  If  MR  or  BMC  status  is  lost  due  to  failure  to  meet  the  end  of  cycle  event requirements, re-certification/re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.10.  (T-3) 4.12.2.  If MR or BMC status is lost due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph 4.10, the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came off MR or BMC status):  (T-3) 26 AFI17-2AFINCV1  23 MAY 2017 4.12.2.1.  Up  to  90  Days.  Complete  a  SQ/CC  approved  recertification  program (documented  in  the  individual’s  training  folder)  to  return  the  crewmember  to  MR  or BMC  standards.  Upon  completion  of  the  recertification  program,  the  MR  or  BMC crewmember  must  also  meet  the  subsequent  1-month  lookback  requirement  prior  to reclaiming  MR  or  BMC  status.  The  missions  and  events  accomplished  during  the recertification  program  may  be  credited  towards  their  total/type  mission  and  event requirements for the training cycle as well as for their monthly mission requirement.  In addition, all RCP event currencies must be regained. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to MR recertification. (T-3) 4.12.2.2.  91-180 Days. Same as above, plus open/closed book qualification examinations (IAW AFI 17-202V2. Open/closed book exams will be documented IAW AFI 17-202V2. (T-3) 4.12.2.3.  181  Days  and  Beyond.
