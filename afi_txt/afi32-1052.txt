Section B—–Responsibilities 2.  Air Force Director of Civil Engineers (A4C): 2.1.  Formulates  Air  Force  instructions  and  implementing  guidance  for  facilities  asbestos management. 2.2.  Directs  implementation  of  applicable  public  law,  safety  standards,  and  Department  of Defense (DOD) directives. 3.  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  -  Operations  Directorate,  Engineer  Division (AFCEC/COS): 3.1.  Develops  requirements  and  provides  guidance  necessary  for  base  facility  asbestos management programs. 3.2.  Provides  operational  technical  support  to  the  AFCEC/CZ  or  MAJCOM  environmental program  manager  (for  those  areas  that  retain  that  function,  such  as  ANG  and  AFRC) overseeing facility asbestos management programs. AFI32-1052  24 DECEMBER 2014   3  4.  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  -  Environmental  Directorate  (AFCEC/CZ)  or MAJCOM  Environmental  Program  Manager  (for  those  areas  that  retain  that  function, such as ANG and AFRC): 4.1.  Provides oversight and environmental support to ensure facility asbestos management is effective at each base. 5.  Base Civil Engineer (BCE): 5.1.  Develops a base asbestos management plan (paragraph 7.1) and maintains an inventory of  all  facilities  with  known  asbestos-containing  materials  (ACM)  and  ensures  real  property records  are  properly  annotated.  (T-0)  ACM  is  any  material  containing  more  than  one  (1) percent asbestos. 5.2.  Develops  and  implements  a  comprehensive  written  asbestos  operating  plan  (paragraph 7.2). (T-0) 5.3.  Examines ACM in base facilities (any ACM that is non-friable or intact and any ACM that  is  friable  or  not  intact)  and  decides  whether  repair,  maintenance,  or  removal  of  the material is necessary. (T-0) The BCE also determines whether extraordinary precautions are necessary  to  protect  personnel  until  recommended  actions  are  completed  (e.g.,  frequent monitoring,  removal  of  personnel  from  the  area,  temporary  controls,  or  other  protective measures).    To  accomplish  these  actions,  the  BCE  will  work  together  with  the  base Bioenvironmental Engineer (BE). 5.4.  Decides  whether  asbestos-related  work  will  be  accomplished  with  in-service  resources or by contract. 6.  Bioenvironmental Engineer (BE): 6.1.  Works directly with the BCE to determine if recommended actions are necessary (e.g., frequent  monitoring,  removal  of  personnel  from  the  area,  temporary  controls,  or  other protective measures) to protect human health. 6.2.  With  the  BCE,  conducts  direct  evaluation  of  facilities  containing  ACM  that  cannot  be reliably  maintained,  repaired,  or  isolated  and  that  is  likely  to  become  friable  or  not  remain intact.  Provides advice to the installation commander regarding health issues associated with "Must remove" mandates. 6.3.  Where  there  is  no  mandate  to  remove  asbestos,  BE  will  provide  advice  to  the  BCE regarding the health risk to facility occupants. Section C—Program Management 7.  Purpose  and  Scope.  Each  installation  with  maintenance  responsibility  must  have  a  written management plan and operating plan to carry out the objectives of facility asbestos management. (T-0)  These  plans  serve  two  purposes:  to  detail  how  tasks  are  done;  and  to  document  the installation’s  commitment  to  protect  the  health  of  personnel.  They  may  be  combined  into  one document  if  each  section  clearly  delineates  associated  requirements.  Current  and  past  records created pursuant to this instruction must be permanently maintained. (T-0) 7.1.  Asbestos  Management  Plan.  The  objective  of  the  asbestos  management  plan  is  to maintain  a  permanent  record  of  the  current  status  and  condition  of  all  ACM  in  an   4  AFI32-1052  24 DECEMBER 2014 installation’s  facility  inventory.  The  management  plan  provides  the  documentation  for  all asbestos  management  efforts,  and  procedures  for  overseeing  the  entire  facility  asbestos management  program,  including  procedures  to  ensure  bases  comply  with  applicable Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and state and local regulations. (T-0) 7.2.  Asbestos Operating Plan.  The asbestos operating plan dictates how the base will carry out  asbestos-related  projects.  The  plan  will  assign  responsibilities;  establish  inspection  and repair capabilities; and provide repair procedures and personnel protection instructions. The plan  will  refer  to  and  explain  applicable  OSHA  and  EPA  rules,  AFPD  32-70,  and  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force  Mishap  Prevention  Program,  with  provisions  for  enforcement.  The operating plan addresses (T-0): 7.2.1.  Organizational structure for carrying out asbestos-related work. 7.2.2.  Project  coordination  and  communication  necessary  for  construction  and renovation work involving facilities containing asbestos. 7.2.3.  Personnel training programs. 7.2.4.  Equipment and supply requirements. 7.2.5.  Identification of worker manuals or other written procedures. 7.2.6.  Yearly budget estimates. 7.2.7.  Procedures for interim control measures and extraordinary precautions. 7.2.8.  Procedures  for  asbestos  certification  and  asbestos  disposition  statements  on programming documents. 7.2.9.  Requirements for a special response team and in-house inspection. 7.2.10.  Requirements for contractor asbestos analysis and abatement. Section D—–Program Requirements 8.  Applicable Regulations.  29 CFR 1910.1001; 29 CFR 1926.1101; 40 CFR Part 763, subpart E;  15  USC  2641-2656;  and  40  CFR  Part  61,  subpart  M,  prescribe  requirements  for  identifying ACM,  notifying  building  occupants  of  potential  asbestos-related  hazards,  and  acquiring specialized  asbestos-related  training.  In  addition,  they  provide  specific  guidance  for  asbestos identification, labeling, control, and abatement in schools, government, public, and commercial buildings.  Planned  asbestos  abatement  efforts  must  comply  with  these  and  other  applicable federal,  state,  and  local  regulations  prior  to  commencing  work.  (T-0)  Current  and  past  records created pursuant to this instruction must be permanently maintained. (T-0) 8.1.  Asbestos  Abatement.  All  damaged  ACM,  either  friable  or  not  intact,  is  presumed hazardous due to its potential to release asbestos fibers into the air. Damaged ACM must be repaired  or  removed  to  eliminate  this  potential  hazard.  (T-0)  Bases  will  abate  hazardous ACM through inventory management, isolation, containment, and removal. (T-0) 8.2.  Asbestos Removal. 8.2.1.  Bases must remove ACM that cannot be reliably maintained, repaired, or isolated and that is likely to become friable or not remain intact.  (T-0) "Must remove" mandates AFI32-1052  24 DECEMBER 2014   5  will be issued by the installation commander with advice from BE and the BCE, based on their direct evaluation of the material and the facility.  (T-0) If asbestos is present at any detectable  level  (determined  by  bulk  sampling  in  accordance  with  40  CFR  Part  763, paragraphs  763.85–87)  and  is  disturbed  during  maintenance,  repair,  or  removal  actions, then the regulatory requirements of 29 CFR 1910.1001 and 29 CFR 1926.1101 apply. (T-0) 8.2.2.  Where there is  no mandate to  remove asbestos, the BCE will consult with  BE to determine the health risk to facility occupants and will evaluate the material’s condition, use  of  the  facility,  the  feasibility  or  frequency  of  repair,  and  cost-effectiveness  when deciding whether to remove or repair non-friable, intact ACM. (T-1) 8.2.3.  When  safety  and  budgetary  considerations  permit  (e.g.,  if  asbestos  is  non-friable and  intact,  encased,  appropriately  treated,  or  cost  of  asbestos  removal  is  less  than  10 percent  of  project  cost),  include  complete  removal  of  ACM  when  planning  operations, maintenance, and military construction program facility projects. (T-1) 8.2.4.  Remove  existing  ACM  at  opportune  times  during  minor  construction  or  repairs (e.g., if wall sections are opened and ACM is exposed, or carpeting is replaced over vinyl asbestos flooring). (T-1) 8.2.5.  Refer  to  AFI  32-7042,  Waste  Management,  and  40  CFR  Part  61,  Subpart  M,  for standards  and  requirements  related  to  asbestos  removal,  renovation,  and  demolition including  thresholds  for  pre-work  notification;  licensing;  site  preparation;    removal  and emission  control  procedures;  and transportation  and  disposal  requirements  and limitations. 8.3.  Facility  Management.  To  ensure  ACM  does  not  become  airborne,  the  BCE  will closely monitor facilities in accordance with paragraphs 6.3.1 through 6.3.3. (T-0) 8.3.1.  Conduct  asbestos  surveys  to  identify  all  installed  ACM.  29  CFR  1910.1001 requires  installed  thermal  system  insulation  (TSI)  and  sprayed-on  and  troweled-on surfacing materials be classified as Presumed ACM (PACM) in buildings constructed no later  than  1980.  (T-0)  Asphalt  and  vinyl  flooring  material  installed  no  later  than  1980 must also be treated as asbestos-containing. (T-0) To verify whether PACM and flooring material  contain asbestos, complete an asbestos survey in accordance with 40 CFR Part 763,  subpart  E  (sampling  methods  are  specified  in  paragraphs  763.85–87).  (T-0)  One commercially  available  non-regulatory  survey  method  is  ASTM  E2356-10,  Standard Practice for Comprehensive Building Asbestos Surveys. 8.3.2.  Determine  if  visibly  damaged  TSI,  existing  spray-  or  trowel-applied  surfacing  or fireproofing, or miscellaneous ACM is in immediate danger of becoming friable or non-intact, and releasing airborne asbestos fibers; ensure such material is quickly repaired by personnel trained in accordance with 40 CFR Part 763, subpart E, Appendix C. (T-0) 8.3.3.  Inspect identified ACM and PACM to verify that the material’s condition has not changed.  Approved  methods  are  specified  in  40  CFR  Part  763,  paragraphs  763.85–87.
