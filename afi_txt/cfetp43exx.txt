Preface 1.1.1.  The  43EXX  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  is  a  comprehensive  core  training document  that identifies life-cycle  training  and education  requirements,  support  resources,  and  minimum core  task  requirements  for  the  43EXX  specialty.  The  plan  is  a  "training  road  map"  for  the  career  field, providing  personnel  with  a  clear  career  path  to  success  and  makes  career  field  training  identifiable, measureable, and budget defensible. The CFETP provides personnel with a defined career path and instills rigor  in  all  aspects  of  career  field  training.  It  consists  of  two  parts;  supervisors  use  both  parts  to  plan, manage, and control 43EXX training. NOTE: Civilians occupying BE positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 1.1.1.1. Part I provides information necessary for overall specialty management. Section A explains what  the  CFETP  is  and  how  it  should  be  used.  Section  B  identifies  career  field  progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and defines the career field path. Section C  associates  each  skill  level  with  specialty  qualifications  (knowledge,  education,  training, experience,  and  other  mandatory  requirements).  Section  D  identifies  resource  constraints  and impacts.  1.1.1.2. Part II  provides a comprehensive list of training courses and standards available to support career  field  training  requirements.  Section  A  is  entitled  Course  Training  Standard  (CTS),  but highlights  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  –  an  AF  publication  that  describes  an  Air  Force Specialty  (AFS)  in  terms  of  tasks  and  knowledge  an  Airman  in  that  specialty  may  be  expected  to perform or to know on the job. The STS is the foundational document for the development of formal courses.  Section  B  contains  the  training  course  index  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  resources available  to  support  training.  Included  here  are  both  mandatory  and  optional  courses.  Section  C identifies  available  support  materials,  e.g.,  AF  Qualification  Training  Packages  (AFQTPs),  which are  developed  to  support  proficiency  training.  Section  D  identifies  Major  Command  (MAJCOM)-unique  training  requirements  supervisors  can  use  to  determine  additional  training  required  for  the associated qualification needs. At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.   1.1.2.  Use  of  the  guidance  provided  in  this  CFETP  provides  the  foundation  for  effective  and  efficient training of individuals in the 43EXX career field at the appropriate points in their career. This plan will enable us to train today’s workforce for tomorrow’s jobs.       4  1.2. Section A – General Information 1.2.1.  Purpose.  This  CFETP  provides  information  necessary  for  the  Biomedical  Science  Corps  (BSC) Associate  Chief,  43EXX  MAJCOM  Bioenvironmental  Engineers,  Enlisted  MAJCOM  Functional Managers  (MFMs),  Commanders  (CCs),  Unit Training  Managers  (UTMs),  supervisors,  trainers  and  the United States School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) Force Development Division (OED) to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field education and training program. The plan outlines the training individuals in this Air Force Specialty (AFS) should receive in order to develop and  progress  throughout  their  careers.  For  purposes  of  this  plan,  training  is  divided  into  entry  level, upgrade,  and  proficiency  training.  Initial  skills training  is  mandatory  training  for  all  officers.  Normally, this  training  is  conducted  by  USAFSAM.  Upgrade  training  (UGT)  identifies  the  mandatory  courses, qualification requirements, and educational requirements for award of the intermediate (43E2X), qualified (43E3X)  or  staff  (43E4X)  level.  Proficiency  training  is  additional  training  provided  to  personnel  to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  1.2.2.  CFETP  Use.  The  CFETP  is  maintained  and  certified  by  the  43EXX  BSC  Associate  Chief.  The USAFSAM/OED  staff  and  MAJCOM  Bioenvironmental  Engineers  review  the  plan  annually  to  ensure currency  and  accuracy.  USAFSAM/OED  is  the  primary  office  of  responsibility  for  facilitating  CFETP maintenance.  Career  field  training  managers  at  all  levels  use  the  plan  to  ensure  a  comprehensive  and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the career ladder. 1.2.2.1.  The  USAFSAM/OED  staff  develop  and  revise  formal  resident,  nonresident,  field,  and exportable  training  based  on  requirements  established  during  Utilization  and  Training  Workshops (U&TWs).  Those  training  offerings  are  documented  in  Part  II  of  this  CFETP.  They  also  develop procurement and acquisition strategies to obtain resources needed to provide the identified training. 1.2.2.2. MAJCOMs must ensure that any MAJCOM-unique training programs complement the CFETP mandatory  initial  skill,  upgrade,  and  proficiency  requirements.  For  any  such  unique  training requirements,  MAJCOMs  must  also the  needed  AF  Job  Qualification  Standards (AFJQSs)/AFQTPs  to  document  unique  UGT  and  continuation  training  requirements.  MAJCOM-unique  requirements  are  satisfied  through  On-the-Job  Training  (OJT),  resident  training,  contract training,  or  exportable  courseware/courses.  The  MAJCOM  must  identify  MAJCOM-developed training  to  support  this  AFS  for  inclusion  in  this  plan,  and  the  training  must  not  duplicate  available training resources. identify 1.2.2.3.  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  all  officers  will  complete  advanced  or supplemental  education/training  courses  as  required  by  the  BSC  Associate  Chief.  This  includes  all requirements  listed  in  the  specialty  description  of  the  Air  Force  Officer  Classification  Directory (AFOCD) and CFETP. Failure to progress in training IAW this CFETP may result in a Commander’s recommendation to withdraw the member from training and from the AFSC.  1.2.2.4. The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 1.2.3. CFETP  Coordination  and  Approval. The BSC Associate Chief is the approval authority.  Also, the BSC Associate Chief will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and USAFSAM/OED training personnel will identify and coordinate on career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.   5  1.3. Section B – Career Field Progression Information 1.3.1. Specialty Description. The AFOCD describes the 43EXX AFS.  It is the guiding document for all Air Force officer classification issues and takes precedence over this CFETP for any classification issues. Headquarters Air Force Personnel Center (HQ AFPC/DPSIDC) is the OPR for the AFOCD as well as all classification (https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/home). The following reflects the most current AFOCD information for the 43EXX career field.  It has been republished here for your reference and information.   issues.

Skill and Career Progression. 1.3.2.1.  Adequate  training  and  timely  progression  from  entry  level  to  the  qualified  level  play  an important  role  in  the  AF’s  ability  to  accomplish its mission.  It  is  essential  that  everyone  involved  in training does his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career. 1.3.2.1.1.  Entry  Level  (43E1A).  For  entry  into this  specialty,  an  officer  must  meet the  mandatory requirements listed in the AFOCD. 1.3.2.1.2. Intermediate Level (43E2A). For award of 43E2A, completion of the BE Officer Course is required. 1.3.2.1.3. Qualified Level (43E3A). For award of 43E3A, completion of upgrade training IAW the current CFETP, completion of the BE Officer Advanced Course, and possession of AFSC 43E2A is required. NOTE: Details on applicability are described in Part I, Section C of this document. 1.3.2.1.4. Staff Level (43E4A). Education and training requirements for this level are the same as the Qualified Level (43E3A). Officer must be appointed to a planning and policy-making position above  the  Wing  Level  where  the  primary  function  is  the  development  of  policies,  plans  and procedures. 1.3.2.2. Specialty Shredouts. Refer to the latest version of the AFOCD for descriptions of educational requirements  for  each  specialty  shredout  for  43EXX  officers.  Specialty  shredouts  include:  General (A);  Industrial  Hygiene  (B);  Architecture/Medical  Construction  (C);  Environmental  Engineering  and Science (D); Health Physics (G); and Medical Physics (M). 1.3.3. Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach to encompass the entire spectrum of  training  requirements  for  the  43E  career  field.  The  spectrum  includes  a  strategy  of  training 7  requirements for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements in a specific time period. The strategy  must  be  apparent  and  affordable  to  reduce  duplication  of  training  and  eliminate  a  disjointed approach to training. Initial skills and  UGT requirements were reviewed, updated, and expanded during the 43EXX U&TW held 17 November 2014 – 21 November 2014 at USAFSAM. Task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS (Part II, Section A of this CFETP).   1.3.3.1. Initial Skills. Initial training is developed and taught by USAFSAM. Initial training is outlined in Part I, Section C of this document. 1.3.3.2.  Upgrade  Requirements.  Upgrade  requirements  are  outlined  in  Part  I,  Section  C  of  this document.  1.3.3.3. Proficiency Training. Proficiency training requirements are outlined in Part I, Section C of this document.  In  addition to formal  training  requirements,  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  Flights should focus  on  a  combination  of  OJT,  in-house  training,  participation  in  the  USAFSAM  Individual Proficiency  Analysis  Testing  (I-PAT)  Program,  and  attendance  of  optional  USAFSAM  courses  in order to maintain the required level of proficiency for critical tasks.   1.3.4.  Career  Path.  This section summarizes  and  depicts the  officer  career path education  and training required for each skill level and function within this specialty. Officers should strive to begin a successful career  by  building  a  primary  job  proficiency  through  a  strong  technical  foundation.    Follow  that  up  by building  depth  through  increased  leadership  opportunities.  Finally,  officers  should  focus  on  building breadth by expanding possibilities at different levels. Career progression opportunities must be carefully planned  by  not  only  considering  professional  goals,  but  personal  ones  as  well  (e.g.,  marriage,  children, special needs, etc.).    8     1.3.4.1. 43EXA/B/D Career Field Pyramid.

In  the  summer  of  2015,  the  Career  Path  Tool  (CPT)  was  re-launched  as MyVECTOR.  MyVECTOR  is  an  enterprise  solution  that  supports  the  Air  Force's  goal  to  provide  a standardized process available to all Airmen for career development and mentoring. The latest version of MyVECTOR will allow Airmen to establish mentoring relationships. Mentors will be able to see an Airman's  career  pyramid  and  duty  history  in  order  to  facilitate  career  planning  within  MyVECTOR. The program is not mandatory but is encouraged. Mentors ensure all mentees under their guidance are personally  and  professionally  developed  so  they  can  achieve  their  work-related  personal  and organizational goals, and ultimately strengthen the overall mission of the Air Force. MyVECTOR and the CPT are both located on the Air Force Mentoring website at https://afaems.langley.af.mil/afmentoring. User guides are available under the ‘Help’ tab upon login.      1.3.4.5.1. Mentoring.  MyVECTOR enables a web-based mentoring network that allows mentees to manage their career development with the input and guidance from a mentor. Mentees will be able to,  in  real-time,  invite  participants  to  serve  as  mentors,  select  mentors  based  on  preferences,  chat with  their  mentor  online,  and  complete  a  mentoring  plan.  Airmen  with  an  existing  mentoring relationship will likely choose the “Direct Connect” mentor option. By officially connecting to your mentor  through  MyVECTOR,  your  mentor  can  view  your  career  progression  and  future  plans. 12  Airmen with a specific need or who are unable to find a mentor will likely use the “Find a Mentor” function.  Mentors  are  selected  by  mentees  based  on  whom  they  admire/respect  and  who  have appropriate insight into professional and personal development.   1.3.4.5.2.  Career  Planning.  MyVECTOR  allows  the  user  to  view  their  duty  experience  through career field specific experience codes. This structure also allows the user to build career plans based on  real  opportunities  and  to  share  these  career  plans  with  development  teams  and  mentors.  A Bullet-Tracker option allows the user to track specific events and accomplishments throughout the year for Performance Reports. 1.3.4.5.3. Knowledge Sharing. MyVECTOR provides Discussion Forums and links to resources for online  books  and  courses  that  discuss  mentoring  benefits,  the  differences  between  coaching  and mentoring and techniques for managing mentoring relationships.  1.3.5. BE  Assignments.  BE officers should work with their supervisors and/or mentors to inquire about assignment opportunities and determine where these opportunities may fit into the BE officer career plan. Career  field  authorizations  and  requirements  can  be  searched  at  the  Assignment  Management  System (AMS) website at https://w20.afpc.randolph.af.mil/afpcsecurenet20/CheckPortal.aspx. Authorizations are approved  and  funded  positions  listed  by  rank  and  AFSC  specific  to  a  location.  Access  to  authorization information is available at all times. Requirements are positions which will become available in the next assignment  cycle.  Requirements  are  posted  three  times a  year  to coincide  with the  spring,  summer,  and fall  move  cycles.  Information  related  to  requirements  is  available  only  a  few  weeks  prior  to  each assignment  cycle.  Not  all  requirements  are  posted  on  the  site.  The  BSC  Associate  Chief  designates  a senior BE Colonel (O-6) to facilitate assignment management. This individual provides a comprehensive list of requirements at the beginning of the assignment cycle. Officers at the rank of 2nd Lieutenant (O-1) and  higher  should  know  the  designated  BE  assignment  facilitator.  For  specific  questions  about  officer assignments, contact the BSC Assignment Officer assigned to the 43EXX career field at AFPC/DPAN.  1.3.5.1.  Base  Level.  A  BE  officer’s  initial  assignment  will  normally  be  at  base  level.  In  this assignment the BE officer will support the operational mission forming the foundation of a career. A successful BE officer can complete an entire career in operational base level assignments or can blend several educational and developmental opportunities with base level assignments. A minimum of three base  level  assignments  is  generally  necessary  to  establish  a  sufficient  operational  experienced-based foundation. Typically, new BE officers start as an element chief or lower, then progress to a Deputy Flight Commander and then to a Flight Commander. As a general rule of thumb, a BE officer should always be within one assignment from a base level/operational job. Base level assignments can range from a small base with only one BE officer to a large Air Logistics Complex with a BE flight of 40 or more personnel. Multiple assignments as a Flight Commander should normally progress from smaller bases with smaller BE Flights to larger bases with larger BE Flights.      1.3.5.1.1.  At  a  base  level  assignment,  BE  officers  should  not  focus  on  a  single  area  of  technical expertise but seek to develop broad-based experience. 1.3.5.1.2.  An  overseas  tour  can  provide  invaluable  experience  and  an  opportunity  to  fill  gaps  in professional development. 1.3.5.1.3.  Experience  in  different  MAJCOMs  will  provide  a  broader  view  of  the  total  Air  Force mission and deeper understanding of how the pieces fit together. 1.3.5.2. BE Officer Technical Assignments. 1.3.5.2.1.  USAFSAM  Consultant.  Individuals,  typically  with  master’s  and/or  doctoral  degrees, provide reach back consultative support to Air Staff, MAJCOMs, home-station and expeditionary BE personnel. Two base level assignments are typically necessary prior to this assignment. 1.3.5.2.2.  USAFSAM  Faculty  Assignments.  Individuals  with  master’s  and/or  doctoral  degrees provide  Team  Aerospace  formal  education  and  training  through  course  development,  distance 13  learning  tools,  and  in-residence  instruction.  Two  base  level  assignments  are  typically  necessary prior to this assignment. than through  an  AFMS  or  BE 1.3.5.3. Developmental Assignments. Developmental assignments provide perspective on the AF and DoD  with  a  focus  other lens.  Adequate  career  field experience/knowledge  is  highly  recommended  prior  to  developmental  assignments.  BE  officers  (and their  mentors  and/or  supervisors)  should  time/plan  developmental  opportunities  carefully  with promotion  schedules.  Some  opportunities  may  make  an  individual  less  competitive  at  Lieutenant Colonel (O-5) and O-6 boards if not timed appropriately. The key thing to remember about any special duty or developmental assignment is that it should be accomplished at the right career point. While the exact  timing  will  vary  by  individual  (typically  mid  Capt  to  junior  Maj),  BE  officers  must  weigh personal  and  professional  desires  for  broadening  with  their  overall  development  and  career  goals. Developmental opportunities available to BE officers include, but are not limited to: 1.3.5.3.1. USAF Academy (USAFA). USAFA is a career broadening opportunity typically filled by Captains  (O-3s),  and  occasionally  1st  Lieutenants  (O-2s)  and  Majors  (O-4s).  There  are  instructor positions that require master’s degrees, and support positions without any specific requirements. As an instructor, the commitment may cost 6-7 years away from BE career field if an advanced degree is required; however, USAFA will fund the advanced degree. For PhD, the time commitment will be near 8-9 years. 1.3.5.3.2.  Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology  (AFIT)  Instructor.  AFIT  is  an  academic/technical opportunity to teach and manage AFIT courses at WPAFB. A PhD is required and the commitment is typically 6-7 years (3 years for PhD plus 3-4 years for the assignment). 1.3.5.3.4.  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory  (AFRL).  AFRL  is  a  technical/program  management opportunity focused on strategic research and development. Assignments involve developing safety and  health  standards  for  emerging  technology  through  research,  development,  test  and  evaluation (RDT&E) activities. 1.3.5.3.5. National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI). NCMI is a 3-4 year career broadening opportunity  typically  for  O-4s  and  O-5s.  NCMI  is  located  in  the  National  Capital  Region  (DC, southern  Maryland,  northern  Virginia)  and  provides  chemical  warfare  defense  analysis.  This organization  also  prepares  medical  intelligence  products  for  SECDEF,  Joint  Staff,  other  national-level  policy  officials  and  COCOMs.  Officers  must  possess  or  obtain  top  secret  clearance.  (Two positions.) 1.3.5.3.6. Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC). AFPC is a 3-year career broadening opportunity for O-4s  or  O-5s  with  no  academic  requirement.  AFPC  is  located  at  Randolph  AFB.  This  is  a  43B assignment (open to all BSCs) that works assignments for several BSC disciplines. 1.3.5.3.7.  Chief  of  Compliance  (Data  Masked).  The  AFPC  Green  Door  assignments  team  pre-screens  and  offers  assignments  to  qualified  officers.  Two  officer  slots  provide  installation compliance  for  federal,  state  and  local  environmental  laws.  Officers  must  possess  or  obtain  top secret clearance. 1.3.5.3.8. Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) position at Eglin AFB, FL. This  position  requires  acquisition  training  as  part  of  the  assignment.  The  duties  include  leading operational  testing  and  evaluation  (OT&E)  planning,  execution,  analysis  and  reporting  of  joint acquisition weapon systems. 1.3.5.3.9. Joint Requirements Office (JRO)-CBRN Development. This is a joint staff (J-8) position in  Crystal  City,  Maryland.  JRO  is  responsible  for  research,  development,  planning,  and implementing joint CBRN equipment and activities. 1.3.5.3.10.  Armed  Forces  Radiobiology  Research  Institute  (AFRRI).  This  position  is  for  43E3G, health  physics  shred.  AFRRI  develops  radiological  medical  response  policy/guidance  and teaches 14  Medical  Effects  of  Ionizing  Radiation  (MEIR)  course.  Additional  duty  is  adjunct  professor  at Uniform Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS). 1.3.5.3.11.  International  Health  Specialist  (IHS).  BE  officers  with  the  appropriate  skills  and experience  may  serve  in  IHS  positions  and  teams.  IHS  teams  optimize  military-military  and military-civilian  partnerships,  develop  mutual  understandings,  promote cross-cultural communications, participate in host nation exercises, facilitate international officer exchanges, and partner  in  international  educational  opportunities.  The  skills  required  to  execute  these  missions include  language  proficiency,  cultural  competency,  expertise  in  regional  medical  threats  and resources,  knowledge  of  joint  and  interagency  coordination,  and  the  ability  to  support  coalition partnerships.  1.3.5.3.12.  43B  Positions.  Multiple  43B  positions  (open  to  all  BSC  officers)  and  multi-corps positions  4XX  (open  to  all  AFMS  personnel)  are  available  for  qualified  individuals.  These assignments are contingent upon BE career field needs and subsequent release of an individual by the Associate Chief, BE. 1.3.5.4. AF  Staff  Assignments. Staff assignments provide an opportunity to develop policy, monitor the  effectiveness  as  the  policy  is  executed,  and  adjust  policy  as  necessary.  Staff  positions  in  the  BE career field include Air Staff (HQ USAF, AFMSA and AFMOA), AF Inspection Agency, Secretary of the Air Force for Installations, Energy and Environment (SAF/IEE), Numbered Air Forces (NAF), and MAJCOMs. There are also Joint staff positions available to BE officers at the Office of the Secretary of  Defense  (OSD),  Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA),  Defense  Intelligence  Agency  (DIA),  Defense Threat  Reduction  Agency  (DTRA),  and  in  select  Combatant  Commands  (COCOM).  All  staff assignments are leadership positions, and are typically O-4s and O-5s. BE officers should have at least two base level assignments, Flight Command, and completed PME commensurate with rank prior to Staff assignments. For Joint positions on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL), Joint PME will be required to obtain Joint Duty credit. A listing of staff assignments can be found at Attachment 4. 1.3.5.5. Joint Staff Assignments.  An update of DoDI 1300.19, DoD Joint Officer Management (JOM) Program, allowed non-line assets (NLA) to have positions on the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL).  Currently there are two NLA positions on the JDAL, both 43E4A positions at Ft Belvoir and Ft Eustis respectively.  Neither of these are critical positions which require a Joint Qualified Officer (JQO).  Additional positions may be added in the future annually during the JDAL Validation Board in December.  In 2015, the board is reviewing 30 medical positions.  Any approved new JDAL positions will appear by late summer of the next year.  No specific training is required for the current two NLA JDAL positions (incumbent or backfill).  However, if these officers want to obtain the JQO designation they will need to complete the following:  Joint PME II (10 week course in Norfolk, VA) or equivalent (SDE in-residence); be O-4 or above; have a Master’s degree; have no unfavorable quality force indicators and;  accrued 36 joint qualification points.  These points can primarily be earned by completing a Standard-Joint Duty Assignment S-JDA 36-month tour (24-month tour for General Officers). https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/30397.  Any commissioned officer may accrue joint duty credit which can be applied for through the Joint Qualification System (JQS) but only O-4 and above may be JQOs.  Joint duty credit can also be earned through Experience-Joint Duty Assignments (E-JDA).  This can be earned from joint exercises, deployments predominately however but they must be applied for within 12-months of completion.  JQOs are not intended to serve in only joint assignments National Defense University (NDU) Graduates that are JQOs must be assigned to an S-JDA as their next duty assignment.  At least 50% of all non-JQO graduates must be assigned to an S-JDA as their next duty assignment and all others must be assigned to an S-JDA for their second assignment following graduation.  Active duty officers must be designated as a Level III JQO in order to be eligible for O-7.  There are “scientific and technical” and “professional” waivers available and they are required to attend Capstone within 2 years of Senate confirmation.  Officers en-route to new joint duty assignment are second highest priority for JPME II seats.  JOM resources are located on MyPers, search “Total Force Joint Officer Management”.  The Total Force (TF) Joint Officer Management (JOM) Handbook (11 Aug 2014) was recreated and 15  published by the Air Force Personnel Center Joint Officer Management Section. This TF handbook will be a useful tool to help you understand the process of applying for experience joint duty credit. 1.3.5.6. Command. Some BE officers will have the opportunity to command a Squadron or Medical Group.  It  is  critical  for  AFMS  officers  to  understand  the  command  application,  nomination  and selection  process.  This  process  is  very  competitive.  Squadron  Commanders  are  O-5s  and  O-6s,  and Medical Group Commanders are O-6s. Squadron Command (O-5) or equivalent is generally required for  promotion  to  O-6.  O-5  Squadron  Command  is  a  two-step  process.  First,  eligible  O-5s  (or  O-5 selects) compete to be selected for consideration. The BSC Developmental Team selects 1.5 to 2 times more BSCs than vacant positions. If selected, the officer must then compete to be matched to a specific squadron.  The  sitting  Group  Commanders  choose  their  Squadron  Commanders.  Additional information located on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx9/MedicalSqCommand/Pages/home.aspx. is 1.3.5.6.1. Command Candidate Selection.  Typically, in the spring of each CY, AFPC will release a PSDM with specific information and schedule of events for the squadron commander candidate selection process.  BE officers interested in applying for command should review this document in  its  entirety  and  pay  particular  attention  to  the  “Health  Professions  Officers  Specific  Career Field Guidance” Appendix. This Appendix provides specific guidance for eligibility and outlines the process for BSC squadron command opportunities.  Eligible officers deciding to compete for squadron command must complete a Statement of Intent (SOI) via the Airman Development Plan (ADP)  and  secure  Senior  Rater  (SR,  i.e.  Wing  CC  level  or  higher)  endorsement.    The  BSC Development Team will meet after the application suspense date to review applications and select the strongest candidates. 1.3.5.6.1.1. Command opportunities are rare and not to be taken  lightly.  When the call for  candidates  initially  goes  out,  BE  officers  should  review  the  accompanying  list  of projected  vacancies  to  determine  the  type,  location  and  mission  of  potential  command opportunities.  Not all locations are ideal matches for all candidates.  “Command is about command”  and  “every  command  opportunity  is  a  good  command”,  therefore,  the decision to apply for command should not be taken solely with location in mind.  There are no guarantees a candidate will match to any command assignment (recall that the DT selects  more  candidates  that  command  opportunities).    Additionally,  officers  should consider  the  unique  and  sometimes  difficult  demands  command  places  on  an  officer and/or  his  or  her  family.    Determining  “when”  a  command  assignment  is  right  for  an officer is unique to each officer and his or her family.   1.3.5.6.1.2.  After  the  BE  Officer  submits  their  SOI/ADP  to  AFPC  but  before  the Command Candidate list is released, they should pull together their command candidate package  that  they  will  submit  to  those  locations  with  projected  vacancies  that  the candidate is interested in applying.  This package typically consists of a cover letter with references,  the  candidate’s  biography  or  CV,  their  SURF,  their  last  three  to  five OPRs/TRs,  and  their  most  recent  fitness  evaluation  score.    This  package  should  be tailored to each command vacancy to which the Candidate intends to apply (i.e. the cover letter that location/mission/MTF, the bio should have a photo if one is requested by the MTF/CC, etc.)  or  for  any  base  that  requests  the  candidate  submit  an  application.    It  is  extremely important for the candidate to have this package complete and ready to send to each MTF as early as possible with the goal of submitting these packages on the day the command candidate list is released.  BE officers should ensure their applications are complete and free of errors or typos. the  Candidate state  why specifically could is interested in 16  1.3.5.6.1.3.  In  addition  to  working  on  their  application  between  the  time  a  BE  officer applies for command and until the command candidate list is released, BE officers should line  up  one  to  three  references  or  “advocates”  who  are  willing  to  call  and/or  email  the sitting senior leaders (i.e. group commanders) of the locations for which the BE officer is most  interested  in  matching  to  command.    MTF  CCs  place  considerable  value  in endorsements  from  their  peers,  especially  other  sitting  and  graduated  Group  CCs.    BE officers  who  provide  a  short  list  of  their  preferences,  with  appropriate  contact information,  to  their  advocates  early  in  the  process  are  more  likely  to  have  those advocates  intercede  on  their  behalf  and  thus  may  increase  their  chances  of  matching  to command.    These  advocates  may  be  the  BE  officer’s  mentor(s)  or  current/previous commanders  for  whom  the  BE  officer  has  had  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  their command leadership potential. 1.3.5.6.2.  Command  Candidate  Release.    In  late  summer/early  fall,  the  results  of  the  DTs’ squadron  commander  candidate  selection  process  will  be  released.    Again,  it  is  imperative  that officers  who  are  selected  as  candidates  submit  their  applications  to  prospective  command locations as close to the release date as possible.  MTFs will be monitoring for the release of the command candidate list and will act quickly to fill their vacancy with those whom they perceive to be the strongest candidate.  Candidates who wait to send their applications risk not matching to command or even securing an interview.  1.3.5.6.3.  Interview.    While  the  SRs  are  typically  the  hiring  authority  for  their  subordinate commanders,  most  SRs  delegate  the  responsibility  for  vetting  medical  squadron  command candidates  to  the  MTF  CC  and  place  a  high  level  of  confidence  in  the  hiring  recommendation made  by  the  MTF  CC.    Therefore,  it  is  imperative  the  candidate  understand  the  specific application  requirements  for  each  command  they  intend  to  apply.    Most  MTF  CCs  prefer  to interview  their  prospective  future  commander  but  they  will  most  likely  not  interview  every candidate who applies.  MTFs are likely to “rack and stack” the candidates based on any number of  criteria  but  typically  the  strength  of  the  candidates  record,  any  specific  skillset  the  MTF  CC believes will come in handy (i.e. a non-clinical BSC for an AMDS command or a clinical BSC for an MDOS, etc.), and peer “word-of-mouth,” etc. play a significant role in making the initial cut.  Making the command candidate list does not ensure BE officers will secure an interview nor is securing an interview a guarantee that an individual will “match” to command. 1.3.5.6.4. Matching. BE officers who make the command candidate list should focus on securing a  “1-to-1”  match  or  commitment  from  the  prospective  command  vacancies.    This  entails  a commitment from both the MTF and the candidate that they will submit each other as #1 “picks.”  The  candidate  is  required  to  submit  to  AFPC  within  three  to  four  weeks  from  release  of  the command  candidates  list  a  “rack  and  stack”  of  their  top  5  preferences.    Hiring  authorities  will submit their rank ordered bids based on the roster of all the candidates’ preferences.  MAJCOMs will  de-conflict  any  duplicate  bids  (i.e.  multiple  bases  submit  the  same  candidate  as  their  #1 match) and provide the final bids to AFPC three to four weeks after the candidates’ preferences were  due.    Approximately  one  month  after  the  MAJCOM  bids  are  in,  AFPC  will  release  the squadron  commander  select  PSDM.  BE  officers  are  encouraged  to  secure  rank  ordered commitments  from  at  least  their  top three choices  in case  there  are any  conflicts  that  may  arise during the bid process. 1.3.5.6.5.  Mentorship.    Without  a  doubt,  having  a  strong  mentor  is  critical  through  squadron command selection process. Your mentor must be someone you can confide in, someone you can discuss matching strategy  and someone who you can just ask “dumb” questions without fear of repercussions.    Additionally,  a  strong  mentor  can  help  BE  officers  decide  when  command  is “right”  for  them  and  their  family.    The  matching  process  can  be  extremely  frustrating  but  the process  does  work.  Someone  will  match  to  command,  will  that  someone  be  you?    A  strong mentor increases your chances that you will be that “someone.”    17  1.3.5.6.6 Multiple Commands. Recently, BSC officers were granted the opportunity at a second squadron  command.    The  process  is  the  same  as  described  above,  however,  only  sitting  or graduated  squadron  commanders  may  apply  for  locations  designated  as  “second  command” opportunities.      1.3.5.6.7.    O-6  Squadron  Commanders  are  matched  through  the  Colonels  Group  (completely separate and distinct process). 1.3.5.7. Airman  Development Plan  (ADP). The ADP facilitates the Force Development process for officers  (2Lt  through  Lt  Col)  and  civilians.  ADP  provides  raters/commanders  with  access  to  Career Briefs, Career Planning Diagrams, and eRecords (officers only: OPRs, training reports and decoration citations).  Additionally,  it provides  officers/civilians with the capability  to  communicate assignment, developmental,  and  educational  preferences,  command/leadership  opportunities,  and  career-broadening requests to their Development and Assignment/Career Field Teams. Officers must keep in mind  when  filling  out  their  ADP  that  their  assignment  preferences  are  just  that;  the  mission  will always be the primary consideration in assignment decision. Tutorials and answers to frequently asked questions  pertaining  to  the  ADP  can  be  found  on  the  AFPC  myPers  website  at  https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/22179.  1.3.5.8. Establishing who is vulnerable to move. The intent of designating an officer “vulnerable” for reassignment  is  to  alert  the  officer  that  he/she  can  expect  to  be  matched  with  an  assignment  in  an upcoming assignment cycle. There are three assignment cycles: spring, summer and fall. Vulnerability is  determined  by  Date  Arrived  Station  (DAS),  tour  length  requirements,  and  current  Air  Force requirements. Basic eligibility for reassignment is 48 months Time on Station (TOS) by the pending departure  date  for  moves  CONUS  to  CONUS  and  24  months  TOS  for  moves  CONUS  to  overseas. Although  these  represent  the  minimum  requirements  (per  AF  policy),  unique  career  field  dynamics may  drive  eligibility  differences  among  Air  Force  specialties.  For  example,  Rated  officers  have  a minimum TOS for CONUS to CONUS moves of 36 months. As a result of force structure changes, the end-strength  drawdown,  AFSC  mergers/consolidations,  and  manning  shortages  in  certain  grades,  the minimum TOS listed above may, at times, be unattainable. Waivers must be sought in the event career field  manning  and  requirements  obligate  an  Officer  Assignment  Team  (OAT)  to  dip  beneath  these minimums and should be used by exception only. In general, officers on stabilized CONUS tours or overseas with a Date Eligible for Return from Overseas (DEROS) will be identified as vulnerable to coincide  with  the  expiration  of  the  tour  or  DEROS.  Officers  on  CONUS  un-stabilized  tours  and overseas officers on an indefinite DEROS are eligible for assignment once they meet minimum TOS requirements or have completed the normal prescribed overseas tour length by the Projected Departure Date  (PDD)  of  the  assignment.  Each  AFAS  cycle  commences  when  the  Vulnerable  to  Move  List (VML) is published in AMS. Approximately 7-10 months out from PCS cycle, the OAT will generate a VML. When the Initial VML is made available, commanders must review it closely. This gives them visibility of officers assigned to their organization who are vulnerable to move. In addition, there is a small window where a commander has an opportunity to request a reclama (i.e. request to add/ remove officers to/from the VML). These requests are commander-initiated in AMS and should be based on mission  needs  and/or  extenuating  circumstances.  These  requests  should  be  submitted  during  the reclama window; if they are not completed in conjunction with the established timelines, they may not be considered. (Source: Air Force Assignment System (AFAS) User’s Guide) 1.3.6.  Education.  Together  with  training  and  experience,  education  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  military professionalism, particularly for AF BE officers. While the Air Force will provide some formal education, it  is  usually  only  through  highly  competitive  processes.  Ultimately,  it  is  incumbent  upon the  individual officer to prioritize and manage their time, both on and off duty, to achieve his or her educational goals. 1.3.6.1.  Professional  Military  Education  (PME).  Air  Force  Developmental  Education  (DE) programs expand knowledge and increase understanding of the role of air, space and cyberspace power in times of peace and war. Air Force education programs prepare Air Force personnel to anticipate and successfully  meet  challenges  across  the  range  of  military  operations  and  build  a  professional  corps. 18  Further,  they  positively  impact  both  recruitment  and  retention  efforts.  The  objectives  of  PME programs  are  reflected  in  the  AF  Institutional  Competency  List  and  implemented  through  the  Air University  Continuum  of  Education.  To  be  competitive  for  promotion,  selective  assignments,  and other  developmental  opportunities,  officers  MUST  complete  the  appropriate  level  of  PME  for  their grade.  Officers  have  a  limited  window  of  opportunity  to  complete  PME,  governed  by  AFI  36-2301, Developmental  Education. Given  the time  constraint, officers are  highly  encouraged  to  complete  the available non-resident programs at their first opportunity. Deployments, remote assignments, and other life events may hinder an officer’s ability to complete non-resident or resident programs if they wait until the end of their eligibility window. PME is divided up into three sub-categories: 1.3.6.1.1.  Primary  Developmental  Education  (PDE).  PDE  programs  are  Squadron  Officer  School (SOS).  BSC Officers are only eligible to attend the in-residence course at Maxwell AFB, AL even though  there  are  SOS-equivalent  Inter-American  Air  Forces  Academy  (IAAFA)  course  (Source: AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education) listed. The main focus of SOS is officership based on Air Force core values. SOS provides Air Force captains the leadership tools they need to build military teams  and  lays  a foundation  for  critical  thinking  in  air  and  space  power through  education  on  air power history and doctrine. Captains and Captain-selects are the target audience for PDE. 1.3.6.1.1.1. The PDE requirement can be met by completing SOS either in residence at Maxwell AFB,  AL,  or  by  distance  learning  (correspondence).  However,  Active  Duty  BSC  officers  are prohibited from enrolling in SOS DL until two years of time-in-grade as a captain (Source: AFI 36-2301,  Developmental  Education).  The  Air  Force  goal  is  for  all  Captains  to  attend  in-residence  SOS.    Each  Wing  will  have  quotas  for  SOS  in-residence.   The  Medical  Groups  will then have the opportunity to nominate officers when they meet eligibility requirements.  It is the member’s  responsibility  to  ensure  their  Squadron  Commander  knows  of  their  desire  to  obtain SOS  in-residence.    If  there  is  no  way  to  achieve  in-residence  attendance  due  to  assignment  or education  in  the  eligibility  window,  the  member  will  apply  for  a  waiver  to  complete  SOS  by correspondence  as  an  alternative.    While  not  ideal  this  will  meet  the  minimum  requirement.  Captains  not  assigned  to  Wing  level  organization  should  contact  AFPC  to  obtain  a  limited number of BSC slots available for that population. 1.3.6.1.2.  Intermediate  Developmental  Education  (IDE).  IDE  programs  are  specified  as Intermediate-Level  Colleges  (in  the  joint  community  and  identified  foreign  schools)  and/or Command  and  Staff  Colleges,  internships  and  fellowships,  as  well  as  certain  graduate  degree programs  through  Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology  (AFIT),  Naval  Postgraduate  School  (NPS), Advanced  Study  of  Air  Mobility  (ASAM)  and  National  Defense  Intelligence  College  (NDIC). Command and Staff Colleges include: Air Command and Staff College (ACSC), sister service and Joint PME-I equivalent IDE-level foreign schools. Majors and Major-selects are the target audience of IDE (Source: AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education).  1.3.6.1.2.1.  The  IDE  requirement  can  be  met  by  completing  Air  Command  and  Staff  College (ACSC) either through distance learning, by attending an in-residence course at Maxwell AFB, AL or completing one of several equivalent in-residence IDE program options. AFPC publishes a list of IDE programs for each academic year on an annual basis. This publication can be found on either the AF Portal or on the myPers website. Non-resident distance learning is available to all officers selected for Major. Eligible officers can enroll in the distance learning course through the Air University Portal website https://www.my.af.mil/aurepmprod/auportal/welcome.AirUniversity.  The  availability  of  in-residence  IDE  options  varies  each  year;  in-residence  slots  are limited. There is potential to receive in-residence credit if IDE is completed in conjunction with a  master’s  degree.  Other  options  include  AF  Legislative  Fellowship  Program,  AF  National Laboratory Technical Fellowship Program, and Army Command and General Staff College. An officer  will  not  be  able  to  apply  for  in-residence  IDE  until  notified  by  AFPC  of  eligibility. Completing  IDE  by  correspondence  is  recommended  for  officers  wishing  to  be  considered  to attend in-residence IDE.   Completion of IDE as soon as possible after notification of selection for  promotion  to  Major  is  recommended  to  ensure  the  member  has  the  skills  necessary  for 19  positions in the  next  grade.    Completion  of  IDE  by  correspondence  can  be  available  to  boards reviewing  records  with  early  completion  presenting  a  favorable  representation  of  officer professionalism. 1.3.6.1.3. Senior Developmental Education (SDE). SDE programs are categorized as Senior-Level Colleges  (in  the  joint  community  and  identified  foreign  schools)  and/or  each  Service’s  War College,  National  Defense  University  (NDU)  programs  (National  War  College  and  Industrial College  of  the  Armed  Forces),  and  certain  fellowships.  Lt  Cols,  Lt  Col-selects,  Colonels  and Colonel-selects are the target audience of SDE (Source: AFI 36-2301, Developmental Education). 1.3.6.1.3.1.  The  SDE  requirement  can  be  met  by  completing  Air  War  College  (AWC)  either through  distance  learning,  by  attending  an  in-residence  course  at  Maxwell  AFB,  Alabama,  or completing one of several equivalent in-residence SDE program options. AFPC publishes a list of SDE programs for each academic year on an annual basis. This publication can be found on either the AF Portal or on the myPers website. Non-resident distance learning is available to all officers  selected  for  Lieutenant  Colonel.  Eligible  officers  can  enroll  in  the  distance  learning course  through  the  Air  University  Portal  website.  Selection  for  in-resident  SDE  is  extremely competitive,  with  very  limited  opportunity  for  BSC  officers.  The  availability  of  in-residence SDE  options  varies  each  year;  the  most  common  SDE  option  is  AWC  in-residence.  Other options include RAND Fellowships and National Laboratory Technical Fellowship Program. An officer  will  not  be  able  to  apply  for  in-residence  SDE  until  notified  by  AFPC  of  eligibility. Completing  SDE  by  correspondence  is  generally  a  prerequisite  for  officers  wishing  to  be considered  for  attending  in-residence  SDE.    Completion  of  SDE  as  soon  as  possible  after notification  of  selection  for  promotion  to  Lieutenant  Colonel  is  recommended  to  ensure  the member  has  the  skills  necessary  for  positions  in  the  next  grade.    Completion  of  SDE  by correspondence can be available to boards reviewing records with early completion presenting a favorable representation of officer professionalism. 1.3.6.2.  Advanced  Academic  Degrees  (AAD).  Obtaining  an  AAD  makes  a  BE  Officer  more knowledgeable/credible, may assist in promotion opportunity at the O-6 board, enhances a member’s value to the Air Force, and can bolster a resume in case a member decides to separate. Currently, it is not required to obtain a Master’s degree until the O-6 board. However, since historically the policy on masking degrees at promotion boards has changed, a one should still consider completing any career milestones  like  this  at  the  earliest  opportunity  in  case  the  policy  changes.  BE  Officers  (and  their mentor  /  supervisor)  should  time/plan  AAD  opportunities  carefully  with  promotion  schedules;  some opportunities may make an individual less competitive at O-5 and O-6 boards. Current trends show an individual  to  be  less  competitive  at  the  O-5  board  if  the  individual  is  in  a  Master’s  Degree  or  PhD program when considered by a board 1 year Below the Primary  Zone (BPZ) or In the Primary Zone (IPZ). Therefore, it is not recommended for individuals to be enrolled in an AFIT program during that time  period  of  their  careers.  When  applying  for  in-residence  AAD  opportunities,  officers  should  be mindful of the perception of being in school too long, especially while in the zone for promotion. For BE  officers,  there  are  essentially  two  options  to  obtain  an  AAD:  1)  obtain  the  AAD  through  one  of many  off-duty  education  programs;  or  2)  attend  a  full-time  education  program  offered  through  the AFIT  AAD  Program.  Funding  for  the  AFIT  AAD  Program  is  available  either  through  the  Air  Force Medical Service (AFMS) or the Air Force Academy Instructor Program. 1.3.6.2.1. Off-Duty Education. Off-duty education is the best option for a member who desires to complete  an  AAD  early  in  his/her  career.  Tuition  assistance  (TA)  is  available  through  the  Base Education  Office if  a  member  elects to  obtain  an  AAD  using  this  option.  Using  TA  generates  an active duty service commitment (ADSC). 1.3.6.2.2. AFIT AAD. Acceptance into an AFIT AAD program is extremely competitive. Program availability  varies  from  year  to  year  due  to  AFMS  funding  and  other  requirements.  Through  this option,  members  can  obtain  master’s  and/or  doctoral  degrees  through  AFIT-sponsored  education. Detailed information related to AFIT AAD opportunities can be obtained on the AFMS Knowledge 20  Exchange (Kx) BSC Education Branch website at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/AFBSCEducation/Pages/home.aspx.  Positions which use the newly obtained degree are preselected and should expect to go to the designated position after graduation.  If the designated position is no longer available after  graduation,  expect  to  be  placed  in  a  similar  position  where  the  new  education  can  be  used.  Performance in a shredded position (B, C, D, G, M) or board certification is required to earn a fully qualified status within that shred. 1.3.6.2.3.  Air  University  AAD.  A  virtually  no-cost  (some  books  may  need  to  be  purchased  by enrollees) opportunity for BEEs to obtain an AAD is to complete Air University’s Online Distance Learning Course. Active Duty USAF Captains who have Total Active Federal Commission Service of  6  or  more  years,  completed  SOS,  and  do  not  have  a  master's  degree  may  enroll  into  the Leadership  Concentration  component.  Successful  completion  of  this  33-semester-hour  program yields  an  accredited  Master’s  Degree in  Military  Operational  Art and  Science,  which  is  the  same degree  that  individuals  who  complete  in-residence  ACSC  earn.  Additionally,  eligible  O-4  selects, who  currently  do  not  possess  both  IDE  credit  and  a  Master’s  Degree,  may  enroll  in  a  combined program, in which successful completion yields Joint-PME Phase I credit, IDE credit, and the same Master’s  Degree  in  Military  Operational  Art  and  Science.  This  combined  program  consists  of eleven 8-week courses. More information on AU’s online Master’s Degree programs can be found at http://acsc.maxwell.af.mil/masters.aspx.  1.3.6.2.4.  Fellowships.  Fellowships  are  designed  to  develop  leadership  and  broaden  perspectives through  observation  and  interaction  with  senior  DoD,  legislative,  political,  and  academic  leaders making  strategy  and  policy  decisions.  In  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  36-2301,  Developmental Education, officers who have attended, are currently attending, or who have been selected to attend programs  where  they  were  competitively  selected  by  the  AF,  may  be  considered  for  IDE/SDE equivalency  credit.  For  BSC  officers,  those  programs  are  limited  to  fellowships  that  are  part  of either  the  AFMS  Advanced  Development  Program  or  AFMS  Executive  Development  Program. Notice of upcoming fellowship opportunities are posted on the AFMS Knowledge Exchange (Kx) BSC Education Branch website at https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx3/AFBSCEducation/Pages/home.aspx.  Fellowships  on  this  listing  that  are  eligible  for  IDE/SDE  equivalency  credit  are  denoted  as  being open  to  ‘Any  BSC’  officer.  Fellowships  that  are  restricted  to  a  subset  of  BSC  officers  are  not eligible. 1.3.6.3. Continuing Health Education (CHE). Officers are encouraged to continue their professional development through CHE. IAW AFI 41-117, Medical Service Officer Education. BSC officers must complete  the  minimum  CHE,  Continuing  Medical  Education  (CME),  or  Continuing  Education  Unit (CEU)  requirements  necessary  to  meet  or  maintain  licensure  or  certification  credentials  for  their specialty.  BSC  officers  who  do  not  have  a  licensure  or  certification  requirement  must  complete  20 CHE (any category) each year.  1.3.6.3.1. AFIT offers a variety of short courses that meet the CHE requirement. CHE opportunities are also provided by various civilian institutions through online and in-residence course offerings. BE  officers,  especially  at  the  CGO  level,  are  highly  encouraged  to  attend  short  courses  and technical  refresher  training  on  a  regular  basis.  Officers  should  consult  with  their  local  chain  of command for CME funding.   1.3.6.4. Language Enabled Airman Program (LEAP). The Air Force Culture and Language Center (AFCLC)  is  chartered  to  develop  Airmen  who  can  communicate,  build  relations,  negotiate  and influence  across  cultural  boundaries  in  support  global  expeditionary  operations.  AFCLC  runs  the LEAP  program  to  sustain,  enhance  and  use  the  existing  language  skills  and  talents  within  the  Air Force.  The  stated  goal  of  LEAP  is  to  develop  a  core  group  of  general  purpose  force  Airmen  across specialties and careers possessing the capability to communicate in one or more foreign languages. To become a participant in LEAP, Airmen must already possess moderate to high levels of proficiency in a foreign language specified on the Air Force Strategic Language List. For more information, go to the website at https://cmsweb.maxwell.af.mil/Leap/jsp/VisitorsHome.jsp.  21   1.3.6.5.  Intermediate  Executive  Skills  (IES)  Course.  The  IES  course  is  targeted  for  field  grade officers  (Maj/Lt  Col)  and  senior  enlisted  members  (SMSgt/CMSgt)  who  are  selected  as  healthcare executive team members at the SGA, SGB, SGD, SGH, SGN, SGP, Squadron Commander and Group Superintendent  level.  It  is  intended  to  bridge  the  gap  between  initial  management  training  and advanced  leadership  training  received  prior  to  command.  The  course  consists  of  morning  core curriculum  lectures  and  afternoon  breakout  sessions  targeting  corps-specific  requirements.  Distance learning  modules  and  presentations  focus  on  the  executive  skills  core  competencies  in  the  areas  of Military  Medical,  Leadership  and  Organizational  Management,  Health  Law  and  Policy,  Health Resources Allocation, Ethics in the Health Care Environment, Individual and Organizational Behavior, Clinical Understanding, and Performance Measurement and Improvement.  Annually each MAJCOM BSC  executive,  each  BSC  Associate  Chief,  and  each  Medical  Group  are  asked  to  nominate  eligible officers.  It is the member’s responsibility to ensure their leadership knows of their desire to attend IES to facilitate their nomination. 22  1.4. Section C - Proficiency Training Requirements 1.4.1.

The  training  requirements  are  the  same  as  those  for  the  qualified  AFSC (43E3X),  but  applied  to  developing  broad  policies,  plans,  and  procedures.  (Source:  AFI  36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted)) 1.4.2.4.4. Experience. The experience and skill requirements are the same as those for the qualified AFSC (43E3X), but applied to developing broad policies, plans, and procedures. 24  1.4.2.4.5. Other. Designation of staff level relates only to the level of functional responsibility and is restricted to positions above wing level. It does not denote additional specialty qualifications. 1.4.2.4.6.  Training  Sources  and  Resources.  There  are  no  mandatory  training  requirements. However,  staff  officers  should  attend  appropriate  supplemental  training,  advanced  skills  courses, local training courses, and professional seminars and symposiums that enhance their staff skills and expertise in their area of responsibility. 1.4.2.4.7.  Implementation.  This  AFSC  is  awarded  upon  assignment  to  some  staff  positions  above wing  level.  Manpower  will  use  the  staff  AFSC  requirements  for  determining  applicability.  The 43E4X AFSC is used to identify planning and policy-making positions above wing level IAW AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted). 1.4.3.  Special  Task  Certification and  Recurring  Training.  BSC Associate Chief-directed special task certification  requirements  are  centralized  as  home  station  training  (HST)  (i.e.  in-service  training) requirements. The execution of HST requirements is decentralized (i.e. to be accomplished at individual bases). Remember that 43EXX skill level training and certification are still expected to be accomplished at  the  required  time  and  frequency  (when  specified).  It  is  recommended  that  local  periodic  refresher training and/or continuation training should supplement both the HST requirements and upgrade training requirements.   Reference  the  ‘4B0X1  HST  Calendar’  found  at  the  ‘Education-Training-Force Development’ section of the AF Portal BE Functional Area to align local officer and enlisted special task requirements.  Special  task  certification  and  recurring  training  specified  in  this  section  are  not  the  sole sources of training and certifying of an individual’s currency, proficiency, and competency. 1.4.3.1.  AF  IMT  1098.  BSC  Associate  Chief-directed  requirements  are  established  on  the  AF  IMT 1098.  The  AF  IMT  1098s  that  are  to  be  considered  part  of  HST  for  officers  are  listed  in  the  table below.  These the  AF  Portal  BE  Functional  Area  at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s2D8EB9D6408E0AD001414B3FCEDF1549&command=function&parentCategoryId=s2D8EB9D6408E0AD001414B3FCEDF1549. forms  may  be found  on Table 1.

Section D - Resource Constraints 1.5.1.  Purpose.  This  section  identifies  known  resource  constraints  that  preclude  optimal  and  desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower. Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has  on  training  are  included.  Also  included  in  this  section  are  actions  required,  office  of  primary responsibility,  and  target  completion  dates.  Resource  constraints  will  be,  as  a  minimum,  reviewed  and updated annually.  1.5.2. Training. 1.5.2.1. Entry Level Training – BE Officer Course. The BE Officer Course (B3OBY43E1 0A1A) is a training course that emphasizes the protection of Air Force personnel through operational health risk assessment,  communication,  management,  and  casualty  prevention  from  physical,  radiological, chemical, and laser hazards in garrison and deployed environments. The course length is 59 training days  (not  to  include  weekends),  which  encompasses  approximately  three  calendar  months.  Students develop  skills  in  identifying  and  evaluating  hazards  and  environmental  problems  and  in  designing control  measures. Additionally,  students  spend  three  days  at  the  Ohio  Fire  Academy  in  Columbus, Ohio, to earn certifications that comply with DoD Fire Emergency Services Certification System. The skills obtained during this course will address duties commonly encountered by BE Officers. 1.5.2.1.1. Constraints. The BE Officer Course is a well-developed course that is reviewed through the U&TW process IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. Improvements and upgrades to  the  course  are  constrained  by  a  constantly  revolving  staff  of  officer  instructors.  Since USAFSAM/OED  is  typically  staffed  with  instructors  who  have  recently  completed  Air  Force Institute  of  Technology  (AFIT)  assignments  at  Wright-Patterson  AFB,  those  instructors  typically experience  a  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  after  only  two  years  at  USAFSAM.  Since instructor training takes approximately 9-12 months to complete, the result is a constantly revolving staff of core officers who do not have a long learning curve to be able to develop curriculum.   1.5.2.1.1.1.  Impact.  The  BE  Officer  Course  is  the  initial  skills  training  course  for  the  43EXX AFSC.  Constant  updates  and  modifications  are  required  to  stay  current  with  changing  AFMS objectives and mission requirements. 1.5.2.1.1.2. Resources Required. Aside from manning constraints, there are no resource requests at this time that require a Course Resource Estimate (CRE).    1.5.2.1.1.3.  Action  Required.  USAFSAM  would  benefit  from  having  officers  from  base-level assignments fill USAFSAM instructor positions. These officers would be able to stay for a full PCS cycle (3-4 years), providing up-to-date perspectives and experience with base-level matters, continuity, and staffing for curriculum development.  1.5.2.1.2. OPR and Target Completion Date. USAFSAM/OED is the OPR for course development and will continue to maintain the course. 1.5.2.2.  Qualified  Level  Training  –  Upgrade  Training  Materials.  Upgrade  training  is  mandatory training that leads to the attainment of the qualified level (43E3X) AFSC.  1.5.2.2.1. Constraints. Upgrade training materials are currently under development. 1.5.2.2.1.1. Impact. Upgrade training in the 43EXX AFSC allows officers to continually develop the  skills  required  of  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  officers.  Exposure  to  upgrade  materials ensures that qualified officers have similar levels of expertise in concepts that are essential to the 43EXX AFSC.      1.5.2.2.1.2.  Resources  Required.  A  CRE  is  not  required  to  fulfill  resource  requests  for  this training. 26  1.5.2.2.1.3.  Action  Required.  Develop/implement  new  upgrade  material  content  based  on  the STS that was generated from the November 2014 U&TW.  1.5.2.2.2. OPR and Target Completion Date. USAFSAM/OED is the OPR for developing upgrade training  materials.  These  materials  should  be  available  for  new  officers  graduating  from  the  BE Officer Course in the spring of 2016.    1.5.2.3.  Qualified  Level  Training  –  BE  Officer  Advanced  Course.  This  course  will  focus  on technical  competency  in  Industrial  Hygiene  techniques  and  execution  of  the  comprehensive  Health Risk  Assessment  program.  This  course  is  separate  from  the  BE  Advanced  Workshop  for  newly-assigned Flight Commanders and Flight Chiefs.  1.5.2.3.1. Constraints. The BE Officer Advanced Course is currently under development.  1.5.2.3.1.1.  Impact.  The  intent  of  the  BE  Officer  Advanced  Course  is  to  expand  upon  a  BE Officer’s technical knowledge and skill sets, ensuring that qualified officers have similar levels of expertise in advanced concepts that are essential to the 43EXX AFSC.  1.5.2.3.1.2.  Resources  Required.  A  CRE  covering  course  parameters,  manpower  requirements, equipment, facilities requirements, and other costs was submitted to and approved by the  BSC Associate Chief in January 2015. 1.5.2.3.1.3. Action Required. Develop/implement new course content based on the STS that was generated from the November 2014 U&TW.  1.5.2.3.2.  OPR  and Target Completion  Date.  USAFSAM/OED  is the  OPR for developing the  BE Officer Advanced Course. This course is tentatively scheduled for a proposed start date in FY 2017.       27  Part II 2.1. Section A – Course Training Standard  2.1.1. Purpose. The Air Force uses the Course Training Standard (CTS) to identify the training students receive  in  a  specific  course.  It  describes  course  content  and  the  standard  of  proficiency  each  student  is expected to achieve in order to successfully complete the course. It is also used as the basis for the Course Resource Estimate (CRE) which describes the human, physical, and fiscal resources required to execute the course. In essence, the CTS is a contract between the BSC Associate Chief and the training provider and  can  only  be  modified  through  the  U&TW  process  and/or  BSC  Associate  Chief’s  policy  directives. The  CTS  is  based  on  the  contents  of  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)  which  can  be  found  in Attachment 2 of this CFETP. 2.1.2.  Documentation. Documentation for upgrade qualification training will be documented on the AF Form  797,  Job  Qualification  Standard  Continuation/Command  JQS.  In  the  future,  documentation  may transition  to  a  web-based  information  management  system  such  as  the  Air  Force  Training  Records (AFTR) program. Alternately, members may use the STS at Attachment 2 of this CFETP. As a minimum, complete  the  following  columns  at  Attachment  2:  Start  Date,  Complete  Date,  Trainee’s  Initials,  and Trainer’s Initials.  2.1.3.  Qualitative  Requirements.  AETC  uses  standardized  proficiency  codes  to  describe  the  level  of expertise  (knowledge  or  performance  based)  required  for  each  STS  line  item.  Deceptively  simple,  the proficiency codes drive all phases of course development, from the language used in training objectives to the formulas used for the CRE. See Table 2 below for the Training Proficiency Code Key. Table 2. Proficiency Code Key Proficiency Code Key Definition:  The individual Scale Value   Task Performance Levels  Task Knowledge Levels  Subject Knowledge 1 2 3 4 a b c d A B C D Can do simple parts of the task.  Needs to be told or shown how to do most of the task.  (Extremely Limited) Can do most parts of the task.  Needs only help on hardest parts.  (Partially Proficient) Can do all parts of the task.  Needs only a spot check of completed work.  (Competent) Can do the complete task quickly and accurately.  Can tell or show others how to do the task.  (Highly Proficient) Can name parts, tools, and simple facts about the task.  (Nomenclature) Can determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  (Procedures) Can identify why and when the task must be done and why each step is needed. (Operating Principles) Can predict, isolate, and resolve problems about the task.  (Advanced Theory) Can identify basic facts and terms about the subject.  (Facts) Can identify relationship of basic facts and state general principles about the subject.  (Principles) Can analyze facts and principles and draw conclusions about the subject.  (Analysis) Can evaluate conditions and make proper decisions about the subject.  (Evaluation) Levels Explanations 1.  A task knowledge level value may be used alone or with a task performance level value to define a level of knowledge for a specific task.  (Example:  b and 1b)  2.  A subject knowledge level value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks.  3.  “-“ This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC.   2.1.4.  Qualification  Training  Requirements.  All formal  courses  and  upgrade materials  are  offered  by USAFSAM. The BE Officer Course is provided as a combination of distance learning and an in-residence course. Upgrade training materials will be accomplished via distance learning. The BE Officer Advanced Course will be offered as an in-residence course.  28  2.1.5. Proficiency Designator Table. Table 3 provides course requirements and experience requirements necessary for each AFS level.   Table 3.

History & Knowledge.  A5.1.1.  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  History.  A  historical  summary  of  Bioenvironmental Engineering  can  be  found  at  the  site  https://www.milsuite.mil/wiki/Bioenvironmental_Engineering.  The paragraphs below are an excerpt from the above-referenced site.   A5.1.1.1. Bioenvironmental Engineering Career Field Origins. During the Civil War there were 1.6 casualties from non-combat diseases to every 1 combat casualty. To address this non-effectiveness rate due to non-combat diseases during World War I  (WWI) the Army Surgeon General, General William Gorgas, created the Army Sanitary Corp on 30 June 1917 under War Department General Order No. 80. The Army Sanitary Corp was comprised of Sanitary Engineers, Industrial Hygienists, Clinical Laboratory Officers, Entomologists, and Aviation Physiologists.  A5.1.1.2. Creation of the Bioenvironmental Engineer (BEE) Officer. Following WWII there was a great  need  for  Army-Air  Force  Environmental  Sanitary  Engineers  in  Europe  as  the  U.S.  rebuilt Germany's  infra-structure  and  constructed  U.S.  military  installations  overseas.  Also,  intermediate maintenance on aircraft was shifting from being done only at depots to more and more being done at  operational  Air  Force  Bases  (AFB).  Commands  began  to  recognize  the  need  for  Industrial Hygienists  (IH)  to  be  located  at  all  their  AFBs  and  incorporated  requirements  for  them  into manning  documents.  The  need  for  IHs  continued  to  grow  at  operational  AFBs  as  the  Air  Force upgraded its weapons system technology to jet aircraft and missiles. It became obvious that these technological  leaps  also  drove  more  hazardous  maintenance  operations  (i.e.  noisier,  radiation  and industrial chemical usage). These operations were potentially hazardous to AF personnel as well as to the public outside our fences. It was after the creation of the Air Force and prior to the Korean conflict that the idea of marrying Environmental Sanitary Engineers with the Industrial Hygienists was  born.  The  merging  of  these  two  specific  areas  of  expertise  to  create  AF  Sanitary/Industrial Hygiene  Engineers  is  the  main  reason  the  AF  requires  engineering  degrees  of  its  IHs,  unlike  the Army.  In  1964,  AF  Sanitary/IH  Engineers  were  renamed  Bioenvironmental  Engineers  to  better reflect our affiliation with the Biomedical Science Corp and the preventive medicine community.  A5.1.1.3. History of Bioenvironmental Engineering and Public Health. From the 1960s until 1983, the  Air  Force  had "preventive  medicine" functions called  Environmental Medicine  at  every  AFB, generally  composed  of  an  Environmental  Health  Nurse,  a  BEE  Officer,  and  several  Preventive Medicine  Technicians  (became  Environmental  Health  Technicians  in  1973).  Environmental Medicine tracked communicable disease prevalence, trained on disease prevention, and monitored industrial  workplaces,  environmental  sanitation,  and  disease  vectors  to  prevent  environmentally caused diseases. The Air Force also had Veterinary Services that treated military working dogs and inspected food processing plants, purchases, and preparation facilities to prevent zoonotic and food borne  illnesses.  By  1983,  the  Air  Force  abolished  the  Veterinary  Corp  and  reorganized  its "preventive medicine" functions into Environmental Health Services (EHS) and Bioenvironmental Engineering.  EHS  took  on  communicable  disease  prevention  and  food  safety  programs,  while Bioenvironmental Engineering focused on workplace hazard prevention (a.k.a. IH), environmental quality, and radiological health. In the 1980's, the AF realized the technical expertise of EHS and Bioenvironmental  Engineering  personnel  could  be  used  in  Nuclear,  Biological,  and  Chemical (NBC) agent detection and defense. The military practice of "preventive medicine" expanded from preventing  non-combat  casualties  to  preventing  combat  casualties  as  well.  In  1989,  EHS  was renamed Military Public Health, then in 1992 it was renamed Public Health.  A5.2.  BSC  Occupational  Badge.  43EXX  officers  wear  the  BSC  badge.  The  BSC  badge,  a  medical caduceus with an “S” superimposed, symbolizes the application of science to the medical profession. The 63  “S” on the badge symbolizes the BEs original Sanitary and Industrial Hygiene Engineering mission when they were attached to the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps. Eligibility criteria for award and wear of Air Force (AF)  occupational  badges  can  be  found  in  AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force Personnel.  A5.2.1. Basic Badge. The basic badge is awarded upon successful completion of technical school or after attaining fully qualified AFSC when technical school is not available. A5.2.2. Senior Badge. The senior badge adds a star to the top of the badge. Wear the senior badge after 7 years in the career field.  A5.2.3. Master Badge. The master badge indicates the final step in the occupational series. Wear the master badge after 15 years in the career field.  A5.2.4. Constructive Credit. Medical Service officers’ time in specialty will include any constructive credit awarded at the time of appointment.  A5.2.5. Prior Enlisted Officers. When serving as an officer in the same career field as when enlisted, count both time in the enlisted and officer career fields to determine the earned badge level.  A5.3.  BE  Officer  Accession  Programs.  Many  officer  accession  programs  exist  for  entrance  into  the 43EXX  AFS.  The  list  below  is  not  all-inclusive.  However,  this  listing  could  be  considered  for  use  by current BE officers for recruitment and mentoring purposes (e.g., enlisted-to-officer, civilian accessions, etc.). A5.3.1. U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA). USAFA is a military academy for officer candidates for the  U.S.  Air  Force.  Graduates  of  the  Academy’s  four-year  program  receive  a  Bachelor  of  Science degree,  and  are  commissioned  as  Second  Lieutenants.  The  program  at  USAFA  is  based  on  the  four pillars of military training, academics, athletics, and character development. In addition  to a rigorous military  training  regimen,  cadets  also  take  a  broad  academic  course  load  with  an  extensive  core curriculum  in  engineering,  humanities,  social  sciences,  basic  sciences,  military  studies,  and  physical education. An Academy education is valued at more than $416,000, yet is offered at no cost to cadets. More information can be found at http://www.usafa.af.mil/ or http://www.academyadmissions.com/.   A5.3.2.  Air  Force  Reserve  Officers’  Training  Corps  (AFROTC).  AFROTC  is  a  college-based program  for  training  commissioned  officers  of the U.S  .Air  Force.  AFROTC  students  attend  college like other students, but also receive basic military training and officer training through the  AFROTC unit  at  or  nearby  the  college.  A  variety  of  full  and  partial  AFROTC  scholarships  provide  for  an attractive way to relieve the financial burden of college education.  More information can be found at https://www.afrotc.com/.   A5.3.3.  Commissioned  Officer  Training  (COT).  COT  is  a  4.5  week  program  that  provides  initial officership training for Air Force judge advocates, chaplains, health professions officers, and medical scholarship recipients. COT conducts training for Air Force active duty, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve officers. This training is provided to qualified officers after commissioning.  A5.3.4. 4B0-to-43E. Enlisted members of the BE career field (4B071) may be eligible to become BE officers  if  they  meet  the  requirements  outlined  in  the  AFOCD.  Interested  members  should  direct questions through their chain of command to either the BSC Associate Chief or the 4B071 Air Force Career Field Manager. A5.4. Leadership.   A5.4.1.  Leadership  is  an  inherent  responsibility  of  every  military  officer.  Over  the  ages  many  great military leaders have displayed their unique talents both on and off the battlefields. All great leaders seem to understand and possess certain core values (or principles), which help them navigate through the  tough  times  of  leadership.  These  principles  include  honesty,  integrity,  commitment,  enthusiastic energy, humility, faith and vision.  64  A5.4.2. Leadership in the Air Force begins with understanding and living our core values every day. The Air Force core values of: Integrity first; Service before self; and Excellence in all we do, help us to  continue  being  the  absolute  best  at  what  we  do.  Former  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Dr.  Sheila Widnall, summed up core values like this:  “Core  values  make  the  military  what  it  is;  without  them,  we  cannot  succeed.  They  are  the values that instill confidence, earn lasting respect, and create willing followers. They are the values  that  anchor  resolve  in  the  most  difficult  situations.  They  are  the  values  that  buttress mental and physical courage when we enter combat. In essence, they are the three pillars of professionalism that provide the foundation for military leadership at every level.”  A5.4.3. One great example of what it takes to be an effective leader can be found in these words, “BE A LEADER” (Source: AFSC 32EX CFETP):  A5.4.3.1. B – BE BETTER than those you have admired and respected. The best way to pay back those who have helped mentor your growth is to be better than even they hoped you would be.  A5.4.3.2.  E  –  EXPECT  THE  UNEXPECTED – You’ve been promoted because of your proven potential to take on more responsibility. This brings with it a lot of unforeseen, unexpected terrain. Be ready to take on whatever comes your way head on. A true leader can afford to get surprised, but he/she can’t afford to let surprise trip him/her up!  A5.4.3.3. A – ACCOUNTABILITY – You will fly lead more than ever now, take the heat for your mistakes  and  those  of  your  team.  Give  your  team  all  the  credit  you  can  and  always  provide  top cover for your troops – even when it hurts.  A5.4.3.4.  L  –  LEARN/LOVE/LOOK  AHEAD  –  Learn  every  day  –  it’s  the  key  to  not  only continuously improving, but also to sustaining yourself as the best of the best (which is what those who  follow  you  will  expect/hope  for).  Love  your  troops  and  your  family  –  always  keep  your priorities  here  in  clear  focus;  never  neglect  either  one.  Look  Ahead  –  you  must  constantly  hone your  vision for  the  future. Without  doing  it,  you  will be  blind  and  worse  yet,  your  troops  will  be too.  A5.4.3.5.  E  –  EXPERT  –  Never  assume  you  are  one;  always  strive  to  be  one.  Be  prepared  for others to automatically expect you are one by virtue of your rank/position.  A5.4.3.6.  A  –  ATTITUDE  &  ACCUMEN  –  There  is  no  substitute  for  a  sustained  positive, proactive,  and  professional  attitude  –  especially  when  you  must  lead  something  you  don’t particularly agree with. There is also no substitute for looking and acting like an all-pro at all times. Remember, a shiny penny catches the eye before a dull one every time! A5.4.3.7. D – DOER – If you are not leading by doing, by example, then you’re not leading. Never ask/task others to do anything you would not do yourself. Always consider this before you levy the task.  A5.4.3.8.  E  –  EXCELLENCE  is  largely  a  function of  mission  success  and  what  the  people  you serve  with  think  about  you  and  your  leadership;  it’s  never  easy  to  do  well  in  both  arenas consistently, but that’s what you must always strive for.  A5.4.3.9. R – RESPECT comes with the grade; what really counts is what you earn!  A5.4.4.  Mentorship.  Mentorship  is  a  critical  component  of  the  AF's  Force  Development  construct.  Mentorship  is  normally  a relationship in  which  a  person  with  greater  experience  and  wisdom  guides another  person  to  develop  both  personally  and  professionally  and  is  designed  to  prepare  Airmen  for increased responsibilities. Reference AFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program, for additional guidance on mentoring in the Air Force. A5.4.4.1.  Mentoring  Benefits:  There  are  several  benefits  to  a  mentoring  relationship,  to  include receiving further professional career development, enhancing capacity to translate core values and 65  strategies  into  productive  actions,  and  increasing  mastery  of  the  institutional  and  occupational competencies.    Officers  are  encouraged  to  engage  in  building  and  maintaining  a  productive relationship  with  a  mentor.  A  logical  choice  for  a  mentor  is  a  supervisor.  While  the  immediate supervisor  should  be  a  logical  choice  for  a  professional  mentor,  they  may  not  always  be  the  best one.  Should  the  immediate  supervisor  not  be  a  good  fit,  Airmen  might  instead  look  for  a professional  mentor  a  couple  of  levels  higher  up  the  career  ladder.  This  person  may  be  a  BE enlisted, commissioned officer or civilian, or work in a completely different AFSC.   A5.4.5.  Feedback.  The  officer,  enlisted,  and  civilian  promotion  systems  require  formal  feedback sessions.  Initial  feedback  to  your  subordinate  establishes  your  expectations  for  their  performance. Follow-on  feedback  sessions  allow  you  to  communicate  to  the  subordinate  just  how  well  they  are meeting your expectations. Just as importantly, the informal feedback you give your subordinates will enhance communication and help improve job performance.  A5.5.  Supervision.  Initial  training  for  all  newly  assigned  supervisors  helps  bridge  the  gap  between  the skills  required  at  the  working  level  and  those  required  at  the  supervisory  level.  Before  first-level supervisors assume their new duties, or within six months after assignment to a supervisory position, they will be provided the initial training described below. A5.5.1.  U.S.  Air  Force  Supervisor’s  Course  (USAF  SC).  This  course  is  designed  to  provide first-level  supervisors,  regardless  of  organizational  component,  with  leadership  and  management  skills required  in  supervisory  positions.  While  most  students  are  civil  service,  military  supervisors  who haven’t  obtained  equivalency  training  through  PME  or  through  the  waiver  options  should  enroll. Experienced  supervisors  (3  or  more  years  documented  supervision)  should  consider  enrolling  in  the Advanced USAF SC. To register, visit the PPDS Virtual Campus, located at the Air University Portal at  https://auportal.maxwell.af.mil/auportal/welcome.AirUniversity.  Contact  your  local  FSS  for  more information on available training for supervisors. A5.5.2. Supervising Officers.  A5.5.2.1. Officer Evaluation System (OES). AFI 36-2611, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, discusses  the  OES.  This  document  includes  information  on  the  objective  of  the  program, documenting job performance as well as dealing with Promotion Recommendation Forms (PRFs).  A5.5.2.2.  Officer  Promotion  System  (OPS).  AFI  36-2501,  Officer  Promotions  and  Selective Continuation, describes the purpose and details of the OPS. Detailed information on such things as promotion opportunities, phase points, selection criteria, and selection boards are included. AFPAM 36-2506,  You  and  Your  Promotions  –  The  Air  Force  Officer  Promotion  Program,  contains additional  information  on  officer  promotion  as  well  as  selective  continuation.  Talk  with  your supervisor and commander on the details of the OPS. Promotion board schedules are also available on the myPers web page at https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/home.  A5.5.3. Supervising Enlisted.  A5.5.3.1.  The  Enlisted  Force  Structure.  AFI  36-2618,  The  Enlisted  Force  Structure,  defines  the enlisted  force  structure  and  implements  AFPD  36-26,  Total  Force  Development.  It  establishes leadership  and  development  levels,  responsibilities,  and  official  terms  of  address  for  enlisted Airmen. It describes special senior noncommissioned officer positions and standardizes duty titles.  A5.5.3.2.  Enlisted  Evaluation  System  (EES).  AFI  36-2406,  Officer  and  Enlisted  Evaluation Systems,  is  the  governing  document  for  the  EES.  It  includes  information  on  such  areas  as performance  feedback,  enlisted  performance  reports,  as  well  as  other  pertinent  information.  This AFI is accessible on AF e-publishing.  A5.5.3.3.  Airman  Promotion  Program.  AFI  36-2502,  Airman  Promotion/Demotion  Programs, covers  the  airman  promotion  program.  It  contains  information  on  promotions  from  Amn  through CMSgt.  66  A5.5.3.4.  Enlisted  Training.  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  covers  the  management and development of enlisted training.  A5.5.4. Supervising Civilians.  A5.5.4.1.  Throughout  your  career  you  will  be  required  to  supervise  civilians.  This  is  a  unique leadership  opportunity  that  requires  specific  knowledge  and  training.  These  areas  include  union agreements, civilian appraisals, time keeping, etc. You can locate the most current information on the civilian personnel system by contacting the Civilian Personnel Office at your base.  A5.5.4.2.  Civilian  Performance  Program.  Refer  to  AFI  36-1001,  Managing  the  Civilian Performance  Program,  for  the  latest  information  on  how  to  manage  the  civilian  performance program.  This  instruction  includes  information  on  such  issues  as:  performance  planning  and appraisals,  incentive  awards,  monetary  incentive  awards,  time  off  incentive  awards,  honorary incentive awards, dealing with performance problems, as well as keeping records.  A5.5.4.3. Civilian Personnel Management Course (CPMC). CPMC is a federally-mandated course and is a requirement for all first-time supervisors of civilian employees.  The course is hosted by the  Air  Force  Personnel  Professional  Development  School  (PPDS).  This  course  is  designed  to provide  military  and  civilian  first-level  supervisors  with  background  information  and  an understanding  of  applicable  personnel  laws  and  regulations  needed  to  effectively  carry  out  their civilian personnel management responsibilities. To register, visit the PPDS Virtual Campus, located at the Air University Portal at https://auportal.maxwell.af.mil/auportal/welcome.AirUniversity.  A5.5.5. Overseas. MAJCOMs and servicing civilian personnel flights (CPF) in overseas areas develop and present training courses for military and civilian supervisors of local national (LN) employees to meet  local  needs.  No  standard  Air  Force  course  will  be  developed  due  to  the  wide  diversity  in  LN personnel programs.  A5.5.6.  Awards  and  Decorations.  One  of  the  most  important  responsibilities  of  a  supervisor  is  to properly recognize and reward subordinates for exceptional performance. AFI 36-2803, The Air Force Military Awards and Decorations Program, contains the latest information on the Air Force Awards and Decorations Program. Some other programs are listed below:  A5.5.6.1.  The  AFMS  Awards  Program.  The  AFMS  Awards  Program  is  an  annual  program designed to recognize and reward outstanding performance in a number of different categories.  A5.5.6.2.  Squadron/Wing  Recognition  Programs.  Local  recognition  programs  vary  by  locations. Contact  your  first  sergeant  or  squadron  section  commander  for  a  full  listing  of  recognition programs available.  A5.5.6.3.  Civilian  Awards.  Civilian  awards  vary  by  location  as  well.  Contact  your  civilian personnel office for local information. A5.6.  Promotion  Guidance.  Officer  promotion  is  based  on  the  whole  person  concept.  Demonstrated expertise and performance within and outside the BE career field is considered at the time of promotion. An  individual’s  assignment  history  should  show  increasing  responsibility  and  clearly  demonstrate examples  of  applied  leadership.  BE  officer  must  take  control  of  his/her  career  –  do  not  leave  it  up  to chance. A5.6.1. PME. Generally “how” Developmental Education (DE) is completed (e.g., by correspondence, seminar, or in-residence) is not as important as getting it completed and doing it is early as possible. All things being equal, in-residence DE attendance may add some weight because of the competitive selection process  for  in-residence  attendance.  BE officers  should enroll  and complete  DE  as  soon  as eligible, which is as soon as you receive notification (line number) of promotion to the next rank (i.e. you  can  enroll  in  ACSC  via  correspondence  as  a  Captain  with  a  line  number  to  Major).  Distance learning PME programs can be found at the Air University website: http://www.au.af.mil/au/spaatz/schools.aspx.  Additionally,  consider  that  performing  sister-service  PME  (e.g.  Marine  Corps  Command 67  and  Staff  College  by  correspondence)  will  heighten  your  professional  knowledge  and  may  provide advantage at competitive selection boards. A5.6.2. AF Form 707, Officer Performance Report (OPR). Performance reports are the bread and butter  of  a career  and  the key  documents  behind:  medal  considerations,  promotions,  AFIT  selection, specialized  training  assignments  and  special  duty  selection.  A  well-written  OPR  should  paint  a quantitative  and  qualitative  picture  assessing  the  officer‘s  performance.  It  is  vital  for  an  OPR  to contain  stratification  statements.  Stratification  shows  how  a  member  ranks  against  peers  within  an organization.  A  stratification  statement  sends  a  message  from  leadership  to  the  promotion  board regarding  the  member‘s  readiness  for  promotion.  Absence  or  strength  of  impact  in  a  stratification statement  will  significantly  affect  the  OPR  (and  PRF  when  the  time  comes).  One  of  the  most  often asked  questions  is,  ‘Should  I  write  my  own  OPR?’  The  answer  is  no.  However,  given  that  it  is  the most important document to career progression, it is strongly recommended that you involve yourself in  the  writing  process  by  submitting  bullets  and  accomplishments  to  your  supervisor  early.  Many times, this is accomplished via a draft OPR authored by the member. For more tips on OPRs, refer to Table A5.1 below. A5.6.2.1.  Awards,  Decorations  and  Recognition.  Quarterly  and  annual  awards  are  important  and should  always  be  highlighted  in  an  OPR.  Awards  are  an  important  discriminator  and  impact stratification  within  an  organization.  Awards  may  seem  insignificant  early  on,  but  they  become extremely  important  in  supporting  OPR  stratification  statements  that  end  up  on  the  PRF.  Other forms of recognition such as Distinguished Graduate, Honor Graduate, etc. during formal courses also become useful discriminators on OPRs that can be used for stratifications. Military decorations are also important for promotion. Promotion boards may consider the receipt of a decoration after each  assignment  as  an  important  factor.  Boards  may  also  consider  the  order  in  which  the decorations  are  received  as  an  indicator  of  career  progression  (e.g.,  receiving  a  Commendation medal after already receiving Meritorious Service Medal may be detrimental to your career). Table A5.1. Tips on OPRs      Throughout  the  performance period  you  should  be  collecting  key  accomplishments  and  outcomes and crafting bullets. This will do two things: 1) it helps you become a better mentor/supervisor in the future when you have to write OPRs and advise others and; 2) it provides key input to your supervisor in case they may not know the full impact of your contributions and accomplishments. If you are not disciplined  in  periodically  capturing  OPR  input,  a  good  habit  is  to  keep  most  of  your  e-mail  traffic over a rating period and review the subject/content. You will find most of what you need to construct meaningful input. You may be asking, ‘Should I put the bullets on the OPR form?’, and, ‘What if my supervisor  does  not  ask  me  for  input?’  Each  is  certainly  at  the  discretion  of  the  supervisor,  but  you should  always  be  tracking  your  OPR  due  date  and  60  to  45  days  out  have  your  input  constructed in order to provide to your supervisor. It will be their choice if they use it.       The  next  thing  you  will  want  to  do  is  get  an  up  to  date  OPR  guide  and  local  instructions  for completing  OPRs.  Don’t  get  too  hung  up  on  the  formatting  (e.g.,  do  I  use  a  dot,  dot,  dot  or  dash  – dash).  As  soon  as  you  learn  the  style  at  one  location  you  will  move  and  the  next  unit  will  have  a different style. What does not change is what should go into constructing bullets that jump off the page at  the  reader.  Each  bullet  should  be  fact-based,  hard  hitting,  and  paint  a  picture  of  accomplishment. The  three  parts  to  an  effective  bullet  are:  1)  Action  (what  was  done);  2)  Info  (how  it  was accomplished); and 3) Impact (what was the result/significance). Avoid the use of flowery words and acronyms that may either affect the readability of a bullet or serve as a distraction to a review board.      Another area you should watch closely is what goes into the top and bottom  lines in the rater and rater’s rater sections; especially the push statements. Make sure from year to year there is consistency especially  in  those  bottom  lines  that  show  continuous  growth  or  at  least  a  consistent  strong recommendation. For example let‘s say they push really hard for school and command one year and then  just  school  the  next  year.  Even  if  not  intended,  it  might  send  the  wrong  message  to  a  board 68  reviewing your record. Bottom line… make sure you review the previous OPRs every time your OPR is due. Make sure the push lines on the most recent ones at least agree with previous ones if they don’t already make them stronger.      Finally, be aware of the importance of stratifications on you OPR. Stratifications are a quantitative comparison  of  an  officer’s  standing  amongst  other  officers  within  a  definable  group  and  within  a specific  rater’s  scope  of  authority.  Stratifications  are  arguably  the  most  important  discriminator  that can  be  used  on  an  OPR.  Stratifications  can  be  especially  useful  when  authoring  a  Promotion Recommendation  Form  (PRF).  Generally,  there  are  three  tiers  of  stratifications.    The  first  tier  is stratification  within  your  rank/peer  group  (e.g.,  1/7  Captains,  2/12  CGOs).  The  next  tier  is  amongst your vocation (e.g., 2/10 instructors). Finally, the third tier is an organizational stratification (e.g., 4/50 Wing CGOs). A superstar performer could have 3-4 stratifications on his/her OPR. Consult with your organizational  leadership,  including  your  BSC  Executive  Officer,  about  the  importance  of stratifications in performance reports.  A5.6.3.  AF  Form  709,  Promotion  Recommendation  Form  (PRF).  The  PRF  is  the  single  most important  document  at  the  O-4,  O-5,  and  O-6  promotion  boards.  The  PRF  briefly  summarizes  an officer‘s career and highlights to the promotion board why he/she should or should not be promoted. All  the  information  included  in  the  PRF  is  obtained  from  OPRs,  decoration  citations,  and  training reports. Additionally, officers who are prior enlisted or prior service in other branches of the military can use information from EPRs, or the equivalent. See AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, for specific guidance on PRFs.  A5.6.3.1. Starting at the IPZ for O4, PRFs will be accomplished for every promotion board. Along with  your  career  brief,  the  PRF  is  the  primary  document  the  selection  board  reviews.  Promotion boards do not have a great deal of time to thoroughly review each record, and may rely heavily on the PRF. BE officers must make sure the PRF is very strong. If PCSing near an upcoming O-4 or O-5 promotion board, watch the timing closely. It is typically better to have the PRF written from the previous organization because a gaining commander may not stratify a new BSC officer above those  currently  working  for  him/her.  This  could  mean  the  difference  between  a  Definite  Promote and a Promote recommendation. (This statement holds true for OPRs as well. Always think about stratification on OPRs.)  A5.6.3.2.  The  Senior  Rater  signs  the  PRF.  The  Senior  Rater  will  make  a  promotion recommendation:  Definite  Promote  (DP),  Promote  (P),  or  Do  Not  Promote.  Strive  for  DP  as  this increases  promotion  percentages  well  above  90%.  The  Senior  Rater  (or  Wing)  will  only  have  a small number of DPs to give; the percentages change but it is about 1 per every 5 or 6 BSCs in the promotion zone. If the Senior Rater does not have enough officers meeting the board to qualify for a  DP  quota,  a  MAJCOM Management  Level  Review  (MLR) is held to distribute  the  DPs.  MLRs are  held  90  days  prior  to  the  promotion  board  and  members  score  records  just  like  a  promotion board.  A5.6.3.3. Mentoring. Officers should seek the advice of others when drafting a PRF. Drafts should be created at least 3-4 months prior to the due date. A member should draft their PRF, send it to a mentor  (e.g.,  senior  BSC  officer),  then  edit  and  send  to  another  mentor.  This  process  should  be accomplished  at  least  three  times  in  order  to  formulate  a  good  PRF.  Also  consider  seeking  the advice of a knowledgeable line officer who may be able to provide a different perspective. A5.6.4.  Education.  Reference  Part  I,  Section  B  –  Career  Field  Progression  Information,  Paragraph 1.3.6.  –  Education  of  this  CFETP  for  more  details  and  guidance  on  educational  opportunities  as  an officer in the BE Career field.    69  A5.6.5. Duty.  A5.6.5.1. Flight Command. The position of Flight Commander is a highly sought-after position in the  BE  career  field.  The  BE  career  field  places  much  emphasis  on  this  position  since  it  is  a prominent  leadership  position  at  an  operational-level  assignment.  Obtaining  and  succeeding  in  a Flight  Commander  role  is  a  key  discriminator  for  selection  to  Lt  Col  (O-5).    BE  officers  should strive to become a Flight Commander at the first available opportunity to ensure that they complete this milestone in time. Also, experience as a Flight Commander is almost certainly a prerequisite to be competitive for a Squadron Command position.   A5.6.5.1. Timing and Promotion. If the timing of the first Flt/CC position is close to the member’s Lt Col board, the member should make every effort to arrive early enough to generate an OPR, or push for an out-of-cycle OPR so that a flight command OPR is on the top of the member’s record for the review board to see. A5.6.6.  My  Career  Brief  /  Single  Uniform  Retrieval  Function  (SURF).  A  member’s  ‘My  Career Brief’ (i.e., SURF) is available through the AMS. Each member should verify accuracy of information in  the  SURF  at  least  annually.  If  information  is  incorrect,  make  corrections  through  self-service functions  in  Virtual  Military  Personnel  Flight  (vMPF).  Other  corrections  may  require  contacting  the local Military Personnel Flight or Commander Support Staff.  A5.6.6.1. Duty Titles. Ensure that duty titles conform with guidance in Attachment 4 of the AFMS Flight  Path  located  at  https://kx2.afms.mil/kj/kx5/FlightPath/Pages/home.aspx.  Duty  titles  that  do not conform with this standard may be confusing to a promotion or reviewing board and, as a result, may not accurately reflect the level of responsibility associated with a certain position.   A5.7. Retirements / Separations. Hopefully your goal is to have a long and successful career that leads to a retirement at the time of your choosing and planning. However, that will not always be the case so make  sure  you  give  special  attention  to  retirement  and  separation.  Separation  requires  special  attention and it goes without saying it should not be made without detailed thought and consideration. Don’t make the decision based on short-term conditions such as not liking your current job or not getting selected for AFIT.  Certainly  there  is  nothing  wrong  with  separating  when  you  have  considered  all  the  factors  both personal and professional, and understand the impacts if at a future date you decide that you may want to return. Make sure you consult mentors and supervisors to help you identify some of the key factors; once the decision is made to separate, contact your BSC Executive Advisor for an exit interview. A5.7.1.  Transition  Assistance  Program  (TAP). The key to a successful transition to civilian life is career  readiness  planning,  which  requires  a  carefully  thought-out  Individual  Transition  Plan  (ITP) incorporated into the entire span of a service member’s career. The re-designed Transition Assistance Program (TAP) initiated by the Veterans Opportunity to Work (VOW) Act of 2011, and the Veterans Employment Initiative (VEI) requires that 4 mandates be completed by all Military Personnel prior to separation or retirement: 1) Pre-separation Counseling; 2) The TAP Goals, Plans, and Success (GPS) Workshop; 3) The Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Briefing; and 4) the Capstone activity. Elements of a successful career ready ITP are depicted in Figure A5.1 below. Contact the local Airman & Family Readiness  Center  to  schedule  pre-separation counseling  and  to  receive  detailed information  on  other available at http://www.afpc.af.mil/lifeandcareer/transition.asp.  services.  More information transition can also be found  70   Figure A5.1. Individual Transition Plan (ITP) Elements  A5.7.2. AF Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG). Both the AF Reserve and ANG provide opportunities for officers wishing to continue their military service beyond active duty.   A5.7.2.1. Air Force Reserve. Operating in various locations around the world, the Air Force Reserve has evolved from a "stand by" force for emergencies into a Major Command (MAJCOM) of the active duty Air Force. The Air Force Reserve currently performs about 20 percent of the work of the Air Force, including traditional flying missions and other more specialized missions, such as Weather Reconnaissance (Hurricane Hunters), Aerial Fire Fighting and Personnel Recovery (Pararescuemen). Opportunities exist for prior service officers wanting to transition to the AF Reserve. For more information, visit https://afreserve.com/.  A5.7.2.2. Air National Guard. Serving part-time in the Air Guard, you’ll continue to receive the benefits of military service with the freedom to pursue a civilian career or continue your education. With more than 140 Air Guard units in the United States and its territories, you can serve where you live. Plus, you can choose from over 200 career options, so you can continue in your military specialty or re-train into a completely new field. Prior service officers can take advantage of various transition programs for entrance into the ANG. For more information, visit https://www.goang.com/.  71
