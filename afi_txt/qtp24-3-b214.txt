Desired learning outcomes:  5.1.2.1.  Understand the safety precautions to be followed pre-, during-, and post-operation of the oversized cargo trucks.  5.1.2.2.  Understand the purpose of the oversized cargo truck and its role in the mission.  5.1.2.2.1.   Purpose  various  based  on  vehicle  type  (cargo  movement,  passenger movement, emergency services support, etc.).  5.1.2.2.2.   Role in the mission (Unit/Base/Community (during natural disasters)/Air Force). 5.1.3.  Oversized  Cargo  Truck  Design.    The  design  of  an  oversized  cargo  truck  varies depending on the vehicle type.  Refer to the manufacturer’s operator’s manual for additional information on the specific oversized cargo truck being operated, and to the data plate for safe load capacity guidance.  The oversized cargo truck normally can be identified by the following characteristics:  5.1.3.1.  4WD  Vehicle.    A  four-wheeled  vehicle  with  a  drive  train  that  allows  all  four wheels to receive torque from the engine simultaneously. 5.1.4.  The 4WD System.  A vehicle equipped with 4WD has the ability to use all four wheels to power itself.  This increases traction which may enable the operator to safely drive over terrain and road conditions that a conventional two-wheel drive vehicle cannot.      5.1.3.2.  2-3 axles.  5.1.3.2.1.   1 front (steer).  5.1.3.2.2.   1-2 rear (drive, dual wheels). 5.1.3.3.  6-10 wheels total.  5.1.3.4.  Additional common components:  5.1.3.4.1.   Air brakes. 5.1.3.4.2.   Manual transmission.    Figure 5.1.  The 4WD System.    5.1.4.1.  Power is supplied to all four wheels through a transfer case or power transfer unit.  4WD vehicles allow the operator to select different drive modes as necessary.  5.1.4.2.  Refer  to  the  manufacturer’s  operator’s  manual  for  information  on  shifting procedures and maintenance. 5.1.4.3.  On some 4WD models, the initial shift from two-wheel drive to 4WD while the vehicle is moving can cause a momentary clunk and ratcheting sound.  These sounds are normal as the front drivetrain comes up to speed and is not cause for concern.   5.2. Vehicle Inspection.  5.2.1.  Pre-trip vehicle inspection test.  Use Attachment 2 as a walk around guide along with AF Form 1800.  5.2.2.  A Seven-Step Inspection Method will help ensure the inspection is the same each time it is conducted, and that nothing is left out.  See Attachment 5 for the Seven-Step Inspection Method.  5.2.3.  Types of Vehicle Inspection.  If discrepancies are found they must be reported to the Vehicle  Control  Officer/Vehicle  Control  Non  Commissioned  Officer  (VCO/VCNCO),  the supervisor, and/or vehicle maintenance:  5.2.3.1.  Pre-trip inspection – find items/problems that could cause accident or breakdown.  5.2.3.1.1.   Vehicle maintenance may authorize continued use for all other maintenance discrepancies.     5.2.3.1.2.   Cleanliness/damage/missing items. 5.2.3.1.3.

The potential for a vehicle to rollover increases for vehicles with a high gross weight (20,000 lbs or more) or a high center of gravity.  Check the vehicle’s data plate to determine if the vehicle is at higher risk for rollover.  5.4.2.  Tire Changing Safety.  5.4.2.1.  Consider  where  the  vehicle  is  located.    If  on  a  bridge,  curve,  road  with  no shoulder, etc.; it is safer to move a vehicle on a flat tire to a safe location. 5.4.2.2.  Find a location with a firm and level surface for the jack. 5.4.2.3.  Turn-on the four-way flashers. 5.4.2.4.  Block the wheels.  If changing a front tire, block the rear wheels.  If changing a rear tire, block the front wheels. 5.4.2.5.  Place the vehicle in “Park” if it has an automatic transmission and low gear if it has a standard shift.  If the vehicle does not have “Park”, place the vehicle in neutral and engage the parking brake. 5.4.2.6.  Ensure the jack is rated for the weight of the vehicle.  Ensure proper placement of jack. 5.4.2.7.  If available, use jack stands after lifting the vehicle.  Once the vehicle is lifted; never at any time get under the vehicle. 5.4.2.8.  Before removing lug nuts, ensure lug wedges are loose (double check). 5.4.2.9.  After  changing  the  tire,  return  the  jack  and  lug  wrench  to  the  location recommended by the manufacturer (keep them from becoming flying projectiles and makes them available for future tire changes).          5.4.2.10.   Secure the damaged tire and once it is repaired, return the spare tire back to its proper location.  5.4.3.  Off-road driving.  For more information on off-road driving and safe vehicle operation guidance, refer to AFMAN 24-306.  5.4.4.  Cargo  loading  and  tie-down  procedures.    For  more  information  on  safely  loading, transporting  and  unloading  cargo,  refer  to  AFMAN  24-306  the  manufacturer’s  operator’s manual for the specific vehicle type.  5.4.5.  Hazardous cargo.  For more information on transporting hazardous cargo, refer to the Hazardous Cargo Lesson Plan and AFMAN 24-306  5.4.6.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  Vehicle operators will remove FOD from tires during daily the vehicle inspection.  Before entering the airfield, a physical check for loose/unsecured objects and an inspection of the tire treads for FOD will be accomplished, with the exception of emergency vehicles responding to actual situations.  5.4.6.1.  Any vehicle which has been driven on an unpaved surface will have a tire FOD inspection accomplished prior to re-entering the airfield area.  Vehicles that frequent the flight line will be equipped with a FOD picker and a covered FOD container. 5.4.6.2.  FOD picker will be etched with the vehicle number painted on red or orange (or have a red streamer attached). 5.4.6.3.  FOD picker will be annotated on vehicle inspection form. 5.4.6.4.  FOD containers will be identified with the letters "FOD"  and will be emptied daily. 5.4.6.5.  FOD checks are performed so that aircraft damage can be kept at a minimum.        5.5. Vehicle Operation.  5.5.1.  4WD operation (if equipped).  5.5.1.1.  High ratio, two wheel drive (H2):  This setting is used for driving in most street and highway situations.  The front axle is not engaged in H2.  This setting also provides the best fuel economy. 5.5.1.1.1.   Shifting in or out of H2 can be done at any vehicle speed.  It may be harder to shift when the vehicle is cold.  5.5.1.1.2.   Maintain a constant speed while shifting in and out of H2 and avoid slowing down.  5.5.1.1.3.   Shift transfer case lever in one continuous motion.  5.5.1.2.  High ratio, four wheel drive (H4):  Use this setting when extra traction is needed (snowy or icy roads and most off-road situations).  This setting also engages the front axle and is best used when plowing snow.  5.5.1.2.1.   Shifting in and out of H4 can be done at any vehicle speed.  It may be harder to shift when the vehicle is cold.  5.5.1.2.2.   Maintain a constant speed while shifting in and out of H2 and avoid slowing down.  5.5.1.2.3.   Shift transfer case lever in one continuous motion. 5.5.1.3.  Neutral (N):  Shift to this setting only when the vehicle needs to be towed.  5.5.1.3.1.   With the vehicle running and the engine at an idle, set the vehicle parking brake.  5.5.1.3.2.   Place the transmission in Neutral.  5.5.1.3.3.   Shift the transfer case in one continuous motion into or out of the Neutral position. 5.5.1.4.  Low ratio, four wheel drive (L4):  This setting engages the front axle and delivers extra torque.  It sends maximum power to all four wheels.  Choose L4 for driving off-road in deep sand, deep snow and while climbing or descending steep hills.  5.5.1.4.1.   Shifting the transfer case into L4 while moving at speeds faster than 3 mph may cause premature wear to the transfer case and may cause gears to grind.  5.5.1.4.2.   Shift the transmission into Neutral.  5.5.1.4.3.   Shift the transfer case lever in one continuous motion into the L4 position.  5.5.1.4.4.   When in L4 do not drive faster than 45 mph.  This will reduce wear and extend the life of the transfer case.  5.5.2.  Refrigeration  unit  operation  (if  equipped). Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual for more information and recommendations.    Refer  to  the  specific  vehicle’s 5.5.2.1.  Adjust thermostat to desired temperature.  5.5.2.2.  Place Cool – Idle – Heat switch to idle position.  5.5.2.3.  Hold Pre-heat switch to the on position.     5.5.2.4.  Preheating temperatures and times:  5.5.2.4.1.   Above 60 degrees, ½ minute.  5.5.2.4.2.   32-60 degrees, 1 minute.  5.5.2.4.3.   0-32 degrees, 2 minute.  5.5.2.4.4.   Below 0 degrees, 3 minute.  5.5.2.5.  Turn start switch until engine starts.  5.5.2.6.  If engine fails to start, check starter for overheating and low oil pressure.  Repeat above steps.  5.5.2.7.  After engine starts, idle for 2 min and place Cool – Idle – Heat switch to cool or heat as required.  5.5.2.8.  Ensure the unit is empty of all personnel prior to locking doors.

Safe operation of a CMV with an air brake system, requires knowledge of:  Air Brake System  nomenclature;  the  dangers  of  contaminated  air  supply;  implications  of  severed  or disconnected air lines between the power unit and the vehicle implications of low air pressure readings;  procedures  to  conduct  safe  and  accurate  pre-trip  inspections;  procedures  for conducting enroute and post-trip inspections of air actuated brake systems (ability to detect defects, which may cause the system to fail).  8.1.2.  Air brakes are really three different braking systems:    8.1.2.1.1.   Service brake.  Applies and releases the brakes when the operator uses the brake pedal during normal driving. 8.1.2.1.2.   Parking brake.  Applies and releases the parking brakes when the operator uses the parking brake control. 8.1.2.1.3.   Emergency brake.  Uses part of the service and parking brake systems to stop the vehicle in the event of a brake system failure.  8.1.3.  Parts of an Air Brake System:  Figure 8.1.  Air Brake System Components.    8.1.3.1.  Air  compressor.    Pumps  air  into  the  air  storage  tanks  (reservoirs).    The  air compressor is connected to the engine through gears or a v-belt.  The compressor may be air cooled or may be cooled by the engine cooling system.  It may have its own oil supply, or be lubricated by engine oil.  If the compressor has its own oil supply, check the oil level before driving.  8.1.3.2.  Air compressor governor.  The governor controls when the air compressor will pump air into the air storage tanks.  When air tank pressure rises to the “cut-out’ level (around  125  pounds  per  square  inch  or  psi),  the  governor  stops  the  compressor  from pumping air.  When the tank pressure falls to the “cut-in” pressure (around 100 psi), the governor allows the compressor to start pumping again.  8.1.3.3.  Air storage tanks.  Air storage tanks are used to hold compressed air.  The number and size of air tanks varies among vehicles.  The tanks will hold enough air to allow the brakes to be used several times, even if the compressor stops working. 8.1.3.4.  Air tank drains.  Compressed air usually has some water and some compressor oil in it which is bad for the air brake system.  The water can freeze in cold weather and cause brake failure.  Drain the air tanks completely.  Each air tank is equipped with a drain valve in the bottom.  There are two types:  8.1.3.4.1.   Manually  operated.    Turn  a  quarter  turn  or  pull  a  cable  to  operate.    See Figure 8.2.  Manually drain the tank at the end of each day of driving.  Figure 8.2.  Manual Drain Valve.     8.1.3.4.2.   Automatic.    The  water  and  oil  is  automatically  expelled.    They  may  be equipped for manual draining as well.  Automatic air tanks are available with electric heating devices to help prevent freezing of the automatic drain cold weather.  8.1.3.5.  Alcohol evaporator.  Some air brake systems have an alcohol evaporator to put alcohol into the air system.  This helps to reduce the risk of ice in air brake valves and other parts during cold weather which can make the brakes stop working.  Check and fill the alcohol container as necessary, every day during cold weather.    8.1.3.6.  Safety valve.  A safety relief valve is installed in the first tank the air compressor pumps air to.  The safety valve protects the tank and the rest of the system from too much pressure.  The valve is usually set to open at 150 psi.   If the safety valve releases air, something is wrong.  8.1.3.7.  The brake pedal.  Put on the brakes by pushing down the brake pedal.  (It is also called the foot valve or treadle valve.)  8.1.3.7.1.   Pushing the pedal down harder applies more air pressure.  Letting up on the brake pedal  reduces the  air pressure  and releases the brakes.   Releasing the brakes releases some compressed air go out of the system, so the air pressure in the tanks is reduced.  8.1.3.7.2.   It must be made up by the air compressor.  Pressing and releasing the pedal unnecessarily  can  release  air  out  faster  than  the  compressor  can  replace  it.    If  the pressure gets too low, the brakes won't work. 8.1.4.  Foundation brakes.  Used at each wheel.  The most common type is the s-cam drum brake, shown in Figure 8.3.  Its parts include:  8.1.4.1.  Brake drums, shoes, and linings.  Located on each end of the vehicle's axles.  The wheels are bolted to the drums.  The braking mechanism is inside the drum.  To stop, the brake shoes and linings are pushed against the inside of the drum.  This causes friction, which slows the vehicle (and creates heat).  The heat a drum can take without damage depends on how hard and how long the brakes are used.  Too much heat can make the brakes stop working.  8.1.4.2.  S-cam brakes.  When the brake pedal is pushed, air is let into each brake chamber Air  pressure  pushes  the  rod  out,  moving  the  slack  adjuster,  thus  twisting  the  brake camshaft.  This turns the s-cam (so called because it is shaped like the letter "S").  The s-cam forces the brake shoes away from one another and presses them against the inside of the brake drum.  When releasing the brake pedal, the s-cam rotates back and a spring pulls the brake shoes away from the drum, letting the wheels roll freely again.     Figure 8.3.  S-cam Air Brakes.    8.1.4.3.  Wedge brakes.  The brake chamber push rod pushes a wedge directly between the ends of two brake shoes.  This shoves them apart and against the inside of the brake drum.  Wedge brakes may have a single brake chamber, or two brake chambers, pushing wedges in at both ends of the brake shoes.  Wedge type brakes may be self-adjusting or may require manual adjustment.  8.1.4.4.  Disc brakes.  In air-operated disc brakes, air pressure acts on a brake chamber and slack adjuster, like s-cam brakes.  But instead of the s-cam, a "power screw" is used.  The pressure of the brake chamber on the slack adjuster turns the power screw.  The power screw clamps the disc or rotor between the brake lining pads of a caliper, similar to a large c-clamp.  8.1.5.  Supply pressure gauges.  All air-braked vehicles have a pressure gauge connected to the air tank.  If the vehicle has a dual air brake system, there will be a gauge for each half of the system.  (Or a single gauge with two needles.)  Dual systems will be discussed later.  These gauges tell the operator how much pressure is in the air tanks.  8.1.6.  Application pressure gauge.  This gauge shows how much air pressure is being applied to the brakes.  (This gauge is not on all vehicles.)  Increasing application pressure to hold the same speed means the brakes are fading.  Slow down and use a lower gear.  The need for increased pressure can also be caused by brakes out of adjustment, air leaks, or mechanical problems.  8.1.7.  Low air pressure warning.  A low air pressure warning signal is required on vehicles with air brakes.  A warning signal that can be seen must come on before the air pressure in the tanks  falls  below  60  psi.    (Or  one  half  the  compressor  governor  cutout  pressure  on  older vehicles.)  The warning is usually a red light.  A buzzer may also come on.     8.1.7.1.  Another type of warning is the "wig wag."  This device drops a mechanical arm into the view when the pressure in the system drops below 60 psi.  An automatic wig wag will rise out of the view when the pressure in the system goes above 60 psi.  The manual reset type must be placed in the "out of view" position manually.  It will not stay in place until the pressure in the system is above 60 psi.   8.1.8.  Stop light switch.  Drivers behind the vehicle must be warned when the brakes are put on.  The air brake system does this with an electric switch that works by air pressure.  The switch turns on the brake lights when the air brakes are put on. 8.1.9.  Front brake limiting valve.  Some older vehicles (made before 1975) have a front brake limiting valve and a control in the cab.  The control is usually marked "normal" and "slippery."  When the control is in the "slippery" position, the limiting valve cuts the "normal" air pressure to the front brakes by half.  8.1.9.1.  Limiting valves were used to reduce the chance of the front wheels skidding on slippery surfaces.  However, they actually reduce the stopping power of the vehicle.  8.1.9.2.  Front wheel braking is good under all conditions.  Tests have shown front wheel skids from braking are not likely even on ice.  Make sure the control is in the "normal" position to have normal stopping power.    8.1.9.3.  Many vehicles have automatic front wheel limiting valves.  They reduce the air to the front brakes except when the brakes are put on very hard (60 psi or more application pressure).  These valves cannot be controlled by the driver. 8.1.10.  Spring brakes.  Tractor and straight truck spring brakes will come fully on when air pressure drops to a range of 20 to 45 psi (typically 20 to 30 psi).  Do not wait for the brakes to come on automatically.  When the low air pressure warning light and buzzer first come on, bring the vehicle to a safe stop right away, while the brakes can still be controlled.  Brakes must be properly  adjusted to work  correctly and to prevent the braking power  from being affected. 8.1.11.  Parking brake controls.  In newer vehicles with air brakes, engage the parking brakes using a diamond-shaped, yellow, push-pull control knob.  Pull the knob out to put the parking brakes (spring brakes) on, and push it in to release them.  On older vehicles, the parking brakes may be controlled by a lever.  Use the parking brakes whenever the vehicle is parked.  Note:  Never push the brake pedal down when the spring brakes are on.  The brakes could be damaged by the combined forces of the springs and the pressure.  8.1.11.1.   Modulating control valves.  A control handle on the dash board found in some vehicles that may be used to apply the spring brakes gradually.  It is spring loaded so the operator has a feel for the braking action.  The more the control lever is moved, the harder the spring brakes come on, so that the operator can control the spring brakes if the service brakes fail.  When parking a vehicle with a modulating control valve, move the lever as far as it will go and hold it in place with the locking device.  8.1.11.2.   Dual parking control valves.  A dual valve is used when main air pressure is lost to release the spring brakes so the vehicle can be moved in an emergency.  A push-pull type valve used to put the spring brakes for parking, and a spring loaded valve in the “out” position.  When pushing the control in, air from the separate air tank releases the spring brakes so the vehicle can move.  When releasing the button, the spring brakes come on again.  There is only enough air in the separate tank to do this a few times. Plan carefully when moving or the vehicle may be stopped in a dangerous location when the separate air supply runs out.  8.1.11.3.   Antilock Braking System (ABS).  Truck tractors with air brakes built on or after March 1, 1997, and other air brakes vehicles, (trucks, buses, trailers, and converter dollies) built on or after March 1, 1998, are required to be equipped with antilock brakes.  ABS is a  computerized  system  that  keeps  the  wheels  from  locking  up  during  hard  brake applications.  8.1.11.3.1.  On newer vehicles, the malfunction lamp comes on at start-up for a bulb check, and then goes out quickly.  On an older system, the lamp could stay on until the vehicle is driving over 5 mph.  8.1.11.3.2.  If the lamp stays on after the bulb check, or goes on once the vehicle is under way, the operator may have lost ABS control at one or more wheels.   8.1.11.3.3.  ABS is in addition to the normal brakes.  It does not decrease or increase the normal braking capability.  It only activates when wheels are about to lock up. 8.1.12.  Dual  air  brakes.    Two  separate  air  brake  systems  which  use  a  single  set  of  brake controls.  Each system has its own air tanks, hoses, lines, etc.  Both systems supply air to the trailer (if there is one).  8.1.12.1.   One system (the “Primary”) typically operates regular brakes on rear axle or axles.  8.1.12.2.   The other system (the “Secondary”) operates regular brakes on front axle (and possibly one rear axle).  8.1.12.3.   Before  driving  a  vehicle,  allow  time  for  the  air  compressor  to  build  up  a minimum  of  1000  psi  pressure  in  both  the  primary  and  secondary  systems,  or  to  the recommended psi in the Manufacturer’s Operator’s Manual.  Note:  Pay attention to the low air pressure warning light and buzzer.  Never operate if the warning light or buzzer is on (typically when the air pressure drops below 660 psi).  Bring the vehicle to a stop right away and safely park the vehicle if this happens while driving.     8.1.13.  Inspecting  air  brakes,  there  are  added  items  to  be  included  in  Step  2  “Engine Compartment Checks”, Step 5 “Walk-Around Inspecting”, and Step 7 “Final Air Brake Check” of the Seven-Step Inspection Process.  See Attachment 5.  Note:  If any of the below tests fail, they must be reported to the VCO/VCNCO, the supervisor, and or vehicle maintenance.  8.2. Using Air Brakes.  8.2.1.  Normal stops.  Push the brake pedal down.  Control the pressure so the vehicle comes to a smooth, safe stop.  If the vehicle has a manual transmission, do not push the clutch in until the engine rpm is down close to idle.  When stopped, select a starting gear.  8.2.2.  Emergency stops.  When stopping in an emergency situation, the operator should brake in a way that will keep the vehicle in a straight line and allow the operator to turn if it becomes necessary.  The operator can use controlled or stab braking methods.  Note:  If driving a vehicle with anti-lock brakes, read and follow the directions found in the owner’s manual for stopping quickly:  8.2.2.1.  Controlled braking:  8.2.2.1.1.   Apply the brakes as hard as possible without locking the wheels.  8.2.2.1.2.   Keep steering wheel movements very small while doing this.  8.2.2.1.3.   Release the brakes if it is necessary to make a larger steering adjustment or if the wheels lock, and reapply the brakes as soon as possible.   8.2.2.2.  Stab braking:  8.2.2.2.1.   Apply the brakes all the way.  8.2.2.2.2.   Release brakes when wheels lock up.  8.2.2.2.3.   As soon as the wheels start rolling, apply the brakes fully again.  8.2.3.  Stopping distance.  The total stopping distance for vehicles with air brake systems is made up of four different factors:  Perception Distance + Reaction Distance + Brake Lag Distance + Effective Braking Distance = Total Stopping Distance   8.2.4.  Brake fading or failure:  8.2.4.1.  Brakes can fade or fail from excessive heat caused by using them too much and not relying on the engine braking effect.  Excessive heat causes chemical changes in the brake lining which reduces friction and causes expansion of the brake drums. 8.2.4.2.  Brake fade is also affected by adjustment.  Brakes out of adjustment will not be able to share the workload with brakes that are properly adjusted, causing the other brakes to overheat and fade from overuse.  8.2.5.  Proper Braking Technique.  Once the vehicle is in the proper low gear, follow the proper braking  technique:    Note:    The  use  of  brakes  on  along  and/or  steep  downgrade  is  only  a supplement to the braking effect of the engine.   8.2.5.1.  Apply the brakes just hard enough to feel a definite slowdown.  8.2.5.2.  When the speed has been reduced to approximately 5 mph below the "safe" speed, release the brakes (for appx. 3 seconds).  8.2.5.3.  When the speed has increased to the "safe" speed, repeat the above.  8.2.6.  Low Air Pressure:  8.2.6.1.  If the low air pressure warning comes on, stop and safely park the vehicle as soon as possible.  8.2.6.2.  Spring brakes will come on when the air pressure drops into the range of 20 to 45 psi.  8.2.7.  Parking Brakes.  To use the parking brake, pull the parking brake control knob out.  The control will be a yellow, diamond shaped knob labeled “parking brakes” on newer vehicles.  On older vehicles, it may be a round blue knob or some other shape (including a lever that swings from side to side or up and down).  Note:  Never leave the vehicle unattended without applying the parking brakes or chock the wheels.  The vehicle might roll away and cause injury and damage.  8.2.7.1.  Do not use the parking brakes if the brakes are very hot or they can be damaged (e.g. from just coming down a steep grade).  Let hot brakes cool before using the parking brakes.  8.2.7.2.  Do not use the parking brakes if the brakes are very wet in freezing temperatures (vehicle will not be able to move if they freeze).  Use wheel chocks to hold the vehicle.  If brakes are wet, use the brakes lightly while driving in a low gear to heat and dry them.  8.2.7.3.  If the vehicle does not have automatic air tank drains, drain air tanks to remove the moisture and oil.  8.2.8.  Safety Reminders.  8.2.8.1.  ABS will not prevent power or turning skids.  8.2.8.2.  ABS will not increase or decrease ultimate stopping power.  8.2.8.3.  ABS will not necessarily shorten stopping distance.  8.2.8.4.  ABS will not change the way the vehicle normally brakes.  8.3. Combination Vehicle Air Brakes.  8.3.1.  Trailer hand valve (Trolley Valve/Johnson Bar).   8.3.1.1.  Works the trailer brakes.  8.3.1.2.  Should be used only to test the trailer brakes.  Do not use in driving due to the risk of making the trailer skid.  8.3.1.3.  Never use the hand valve for parking because all the air might leak out unlocking the brakes.  8.3.1.4.  If trailer does not have spring brakes, use wheel chocks to keep the trailer from moving. 8.3.2.  Tractor  Protection  Valve.    Keeps  air  in  the  tractor  should  the  trailer  break  away  or develop a leak.  8.3.2.1.  “Trailer  air  supply”  control  valve  in  the  cab  controls  (opens/closes)  tractor protection valve.  8.3.2.2.  Will close automatically if air pressure is low (20-45 psi).  This stops air from going out of the tractor, and lets the air out of the trailer emergency line which causes the trailer emergency brakes to come on.  8.3.3.  Tractor Air Supply Control.  8.3.3.1.  Red eight-sided knob which is used to control the tractor protection valve.  8.3.3.2.  Push in to supply the trailer with air.  8.3.3.3.  Pull out to shut the air off and put on the trailer emergency brakes.  8.3.4.  Trailer Air Lines.  Every combination vehicle has two air lines that run between each vehicle:  8.3.4.1.  Service Air Line.  The service line (also called the control line or signal line) carries air which is controlled by the foot brake or the trailer hand brake.  Depending on how hard the operator presses the foot brake or hand valve, the pressure in the service line will similarly change.  The service line is connected to relay valves.  These valves allow the trailer brakes to be applied more quickly than would otherwise be possible.  8.3.4.2.  Emergency Air Line (also called supply line).  Supplies air to the trailer air tanks, and controls the emergency brakes on combination vehicles.  Loss of air pressure in the emergency line causes the trailer emergency brakes to come on.  The pressure loss could be caused by a trailer breaking loose, thus tearing apart the emergency air hose.  Or it could be caused by a hose, metal tubing, or other part which breaks, letting the air out.   8.3.4.2.1.   Emergency lines are often coded with the color red (red hose, red couplers, or other parts) to keep from getting them mixed up with the blue service line.   8.3.4.3.  Hose Couplers (glad hands).  Coupling devices used to connect air lines from tractor to the trailer.  They have a rubber seal which prevents air from escaping.  8.3.4.3.1.   Check for cracks and splits in the rubber seal.  Clean the couplers and rubber seals before a connection is made and check for dry rotting/cracked seals and proper seat.  8.3.4.3.2.   "Dead end" or dummy couplers.  A place to attach the hoses when not in use that prevents water and dirt from getting into coupler and air lines.  If unavailable, glad hands can sometimes be locked together depending on the couplings.  8.3.4.3.3.   When  connecting  the  glad  hands,  press  the  two  seals  together  with  the couplers at a 90 degree angle to each other.  A turn of the glad hand attached to the hose  will  join  and  lock  the  couplers.    Make  sure  to  couple  the  proper  glad  hands together.  8.3.4.3.4.   Look for color coding and tags marked service or emergency.  Service lines are blue and emergency (supply) lines are red.  8.3.4.4.  If the airlines are crossed, supply air will be sent to the service line instead of going to charge the trailer air tanks.  Air will not be available to release the trailer spring brakes (parking brakes).  If the spring brakes don't release when pushing the trailer air supply control, check the air line connections.  8.3.4.5.  Older trailers do not have spring brakes.  If the air supply in the trailer air tank has leaked away there will be no emergency brakes, and the trailer wheels will turn freely.  If the air lines were crossed, the operator could drive away, but they wouldn't have trailer brakes.  8.3.4.5.1.   Always  test  the  trailer  brakes  before  driving  with  the  hand  valve  or  by pulling the air supply (tractor protection valve) control.  Pull gently against them in a low gear to make sure the brakes work.  8.3.5.  Trailer Air Tanks.  Each trailer and converter dolly has one or more air tanks.  They are filled by the emergency (supply) line from the tractor.  They provide the air pressure used to operate trailer brakes.  8.3.5.1.  Air pressure is sent from the air tanks to the brakes by relay valves.  The pressure in the service line tells how much pressure the relay valves should send to the trailer brakes.  The pressure in the service line is controlled by the brake pedal (and the trailer hand brake).  8.3.5.2.  It is important that water and oil don’t build up in the air tanks.  If they do, the brakes may not work correctly.  Each tank has a drain valve on it, and each tank should be drained every day.  If the tanks have automatic drains, they will keep most moisture out.  But open the drains to make sure.  Tank drains should not be left open over night after draining.  8.3.6.  Shut-off valves (Cut-out cocks).  Shut-off valves (also called cut-out cocks) are used in the service and supply air lines at the back of trailers used to tow other trailers.  These valves permit closing the air lines off when another trailer is not being towed.  Check that all shut-off valves are in the open position except the ones at the back of the last trailer, which must be closed. 8.3.7.  Trailer service, parking and emergency brakes.  8.3.7.1.  Newer trailers have spring brakes just like trucks and truck tractors.  However, converter dollies and trailers built before 1975 are not required to have spring brakes.  8.3.7.2.  A major leak in the emergency line will cause the tractor protection valve to close and the trailer emergency brakes to come on.    Attachment 1   GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION References AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations, 5 May 2016 AFI 13-213, Airfield Driving, 1 June 2011 AFMAN 24-306, Operation of Air Force Government Motor Vehicles, 9 December 2016  Adopted Forms AF Form 171, Request for Driver’s Training and Addition to U.S. Government Drivers, 15 March 2011 AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication, 22 September 2009 AF Form 1800, Operator’s Inspection Guide and Trouble Report  Abbreviations and Acronyms ABS—Antilock Brake System AF—Air Force AFI—Air Force Instruction AFIMSC—Air Force Installation Mission Support Center AFMAN—Air Force Manual AFQTP—Air Force Qualification Training Plan CDL—Commercial Driver’s License FOD—Foreign Object Damage H2—High Ratio, Two Wheel Drive H4—High Ratio, Four Wheel Drive HAZMAT—Hazardous Materials IAW—In Accordance With L4—Low Ratio, Four Wheel Drive RM—Risk Management TO—Technical Order VCNCO—Vehicle Control Non Commissioned Officer VCO—Vehicle Control Officer 4WD—Four Wheel Drive   OVERSIZED CARGO TRUCK INSPECTION GUIDE Attachment 2   GENERAL  STEP 1.

CERTIFIER COMMENTS:     Go                             Notes Notes         Attachment 4 PERFORMANCE TEST GUIDE  A4.1.   Straight Line Backing.  Back through and out of the alley/lane, without touching boundary lines or cones on either side of the alley/lane.  Figure A4.1.  Straight Line Backing.       A4.2.   Offset Backing – Left/Right.  Adjust boundary depending on vehicle.  At the start of the exercise, the vehicle is positioned in the right lane; the operator moves straight ahead and stops at the outer barrier lines/cones.  The operator then backs the vehicle so it is positioned in the left lane and continues backing until the vehicle has cleared the forward set of cones with the front of the vehicle.  A4.2.1.   The  outer  and  side  boundaries  are  containment  boundaries  and  are  used  as  a reference only.  A4.2.2.   The opposite lane is used for Offset Back-Right.  The driver drives straight in the left lane to the outer barrier, and backs the vehicle so it is positioned in the right lane and continues to back the vehicle until the front vehicle has cleared the forward set of cones.  Figure A4.2.  Offset Backing – Left/Right.   A4.3.   Parallel Parking.  The length of the parking space must be adjusted for the operator’s vehicle before the driver does this exercise.  The space must be the length of the vehicle plus 15 feet.  The operator must drive past the entrance to the parking space, remaining parallel to the space.  From this position the driver must back into it.  There are two types of parallel parking exercises.    “Sight-sided”:  the  parking  space  is  on  the  driver’s  side  of  the  vehicle;  and “Conventional”: the parking space is on the passenger side of the vehicle.     Figure A4.3.  Parallel Parking.    A4.4.   Alley Dock.  The length of the parking space must be adjusted for the operator’s vehicle before the driver does this exercise.  The space must be the length of the vehicle plus 15 feet.  The operator must drive past the entrance to the parking space, remaining parallel to the space.  From this position the driver must back into it.  There are two types of parallel parking exercises.  “Sight-sided”: the parking space is on the driver’s side of the vehicle; and “Conventional”: the parking space is on the passenger side of the vehicle.    Figure  A4.4.    Alley  Dock.    The  outer  boundary  must  be  adjusted  for  the  vehicle  class.    The operator will drive by the entrance to the alley so that the entrance is on the driver’s side of the vehicle and the vehicle is parallel to the outer boundary.  The operator must back into the alley and stop within three feet of the rear of the alley.    A4.5.   Left/Right  Turn  (4).    Include  turns  at  traffic  lights,  stop  signs,  and  uncontrolled intersections.  The turns should range from easy to somewhat difficult for commercial vehicles.  The operator should try to get a mixture of types of intersections so that they vary in complexity.  Try to include turns that have multiple approach lanes and a single approach lane turning onto a street with multiple lanes.  A4.6.   Lane Change (2).  Include two lane changes maneuvers.  Each maneuver must include a lane change to the left and to the right.  The lane change maneuvers can be conducted during any portion of the road test.  The locations should be suitable for conducting lane changes and allow enough time for the driver to complete each lane change.  The lane change maneuvers may be conducted during the expressway, urban or rural driving sections provided a sufficient amount of driving distance is available.  A4.7.   Urban Highway.  This section should be at least two miles long.  It should contain through intersections and intersections with traffic lights.  It should have moderate traffic density.  The section should be one that allows the operator to see how the operator copes with traffic in a typical business area.  One set of lane change maneuvers may be conducted within this section.  A4.8.   Intersections.  Select two through intersection and two intersections where a stop has to be made (a stop sign is preferred.  These intersections should not be included in the urban section.  One of the stop intersections should not be controlled by traffic lights (2- or 4-way stop).  A4.9.   Railroad Crossing.  Try to have an uncontrolled (no lights or stop arms) railroad crossing.  The crossing should have enough sight distance to see if the operator checks left and right while approaching the crossing.  The operator’s looking left and right down the track will often be the only way to tell if the operator has noticed the crossing.  A4.9.1.   If there is no railroad crossing in the testing area, do the following.  Find a lightly traveled street or road that contains a landmark which the observer will point out to the operator.  Tell the operator to pretend that there is a railroad crossing at that point.  The landmark can be an intersection, an entrance to the road, or a road sign or billboard.  Give the operator instructions out of traffic, while the vehicle is stopped.  A4.10.  Curves (2).  Try to get curves that are tight enough to produce noticeable off tracking on a truck/tractor trailer.  The curves should have clearly marked driving lanes.  In many cases, a highway on-ramp or exit ramp can be used as a curve.  A4.11.  Expressway.  A4.11.1.  The operator should use a roadway segment in or close to the testing area.  If there is no roadway, freeway, etc., then use a road or highway with high speeds.  A4.11.2.  The roadway section should be a four-lane controlled access highway such as an interstate highway.  The section should start with a conventional ramp entrance and end with a conventional ramp exit.  One set of lane change maneuvers may be conducted within this section.  A4.11.3.  If using a rural highway section, it should be at least two miles long.  (In general, look for an area of rural road that provides driving challenges similar to those found on an expressway.)  One set of lane change maneuvers may be conducted within this section.  A4.12.  Roadside Stop/Start.  The section of the road selected for this maneuver must allow the driver to pull the vehicle safely over and stop out of the normal flow of traffic.  Be sure to select a location where commercial vehicles can safely exit and enter the roadway.    A4.13.  Low Clearance, Weight Restriction, or Traffic Sign.  This task requires the operator to observe  vehicle  height  and/or  weight  restrictions.    A  variety  of  situations  could  be  used  with overpasses  and  bridges  being  good  candidates.    The  overpass  should  have  a  posted  clearance height.  The bridge should have a posted weight limit.  If overpasses or bridges with posted limits cannot be found, use ones that do not have posted limits.  If any low clearances or bridges cannot be found, look for places or situations where there are signs that a heavy vehicle operator should see.  Examples would be signing for “No Commercial Vehicles after 11:00 p.m.” or “Bridge with 10 Ton Weight Limit in 5 Miles.”   Attachment 5 SEVEN-STEP INSPECTION PROCESS  Figure A5.1.

Additional Steps for Inspecting Air Brakes Step 2.  Engine Compartment Checks 5.  Walk-Around Inspecting 7.  Final Air Brake Check • • o o o o • • o o o o • o o o o o • o Procedure Check air compressor drive belt condition and tightness (if compressor is belt driven). Check manual slack adjusters on S-cam brakes.  Note:  Vehicles with automatic slack adjustors still must be checked. Park on level ground and chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes so the operator can move the slack adjusters. Use gloves and pull hard on each slack adjuster that it can be reached. Check slack adjuster, more than 1-inch indicates adjustments required (vehicles with too much brake slack can be very hard to stop).  Adjust it or have it adjusted. Check brake drums (or discs), linings, and hoses. Test low pressure warning signal. Shut the engine off when the vehicle has enough air pressure so that the low pressure warning signal is not on. Turn the electrical power on. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce air tank pressure. Low air pressure warning signal should come on before the pressure drops to less than 60 psi in the air tank with lowest pressure. Check that the spring brakes come on automatically. Chock the wheels. Release the parking brakes when enough air pressure is built up. Shut the engine off. Step on and off the brake pedal to reduce the air tank pressure. "Parking brake" knob should pop out when the air pressure falls to the manufacturer's specification. Check rate of air pressure buildup Refer to manufacturer’s recommendation for average buildup time.   o If not within recommended time, the air pressure may drop too low during driving operations. Test air leakage rate. • o  With a fully-charged air system (typically 125 o o o o • psi). Turn-off the engine. Release the service brake and time the air pressure drop. The loss rate should be less than 2 psi in one minute for single vehicles. Not less than 3 psi in 1 minute for combination vehicles. Then apply 90 psi or more with the brake pedal. After the initial pressure drop, if the air pressure falls more than 3 psi in 1 minute for single vehicles. Not more than 4 psi for combination vehicles. Check air compressor governor cut-in and cut-out pressures. Air compressor should start at about 100 psi and stop at about 125 psi. Run the engine at a fast idle. Air governor should cut-out the air compressor at about the manufacturer's specified pressure. Engine idling, step on and off brake to reduce air tank pressure. Compressor should cut-in at manufacturer's specified cut-in pressure. Test parking brake:  Stop the vehicle; put the parking brake on; gently pull against it in low gear to determine if parking brake will hold. Test service brakes. Wait for normal air pressure. Release the parking brake. Move the vehicle forward slowly (about 5 mph). Apply the brakes firmly using the brake pedal. Note any vehicle "pulling" to one side, unusual feel, or delayed stopping action. o o • o o o o o o   • • • •
