Overview.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  completing initial  mission  qualification  and  mission  requalification.    Upon  completion  of  mission qualification  training,  the  squadron  commander  will  assign  a  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC), Mission Ready (MR), or Combat Mission Ready (CMR) training status to the aircrew member.  (T-2). 3.2.  General Requirements.  The primary method of mission qualification or requalification is to  complete  the  appropriate  formal  training  course  listed  in  the  ETCA.    Completing  the appropriate formal course satisfies the training requirements of this chapter.  If no requalification course  exists,  conduct  requalification  using  the  initial  mission  qualification  course.    When attendance is not practical or quotas are not available, units may request waivers to conduct SMT for mission requalification IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, as supplemented and Paragraph 4.4 of this instruction.  (T-2). 3.3.  MQT Prerequisites.  Course prerequisites are IAW the appropriate formal course syllabus listed  in  the  ETCAand  AFI  11-202,  Vol.  1.    The  formal  school  syllabus  designates  the  course prerequisite approval authority. 3.3.1.  This  does  not  preclude  simultaneous  basic  qualification  and  mission  qualification training.    Simultaneous/concurrent  multiple-MDS  qualification  upgrades  will  not  be accomplished.  (T-2). 3.3.2.  If there is not a separate mission requalification course, aircrew members requalifying in  the unit’s mission  will  comply with  the initial  mission qualification course prerequisites.  (T-2). 3.4.  Ground Training Requirements.  Complete all required ground training IAW AFI 11202, Vol. 1, and applicable RTM  prior to certifying individuals as MR.  Completion of training will establish  due  dates  for  recurring  ground  training  required  in  Chapter  4.    Credit  any  training accomplished  at  a  formal  school.    (T-2).    Qualified  MR  crewmembers  transferred  from  other units require only unit specific MR training events or events which are due/overdue. 3.4.1.  Academic  Training.    Complete  all  academic  and  ground  training  delineated  in applicable courseware.  (T-2). 3.4.2.  Written Examinations.  Formal school end of course examinations or group stan/eval or equivalent examinations for SMT satisfy this requirement. 3.5.  Flying  Training  Requirements.  Satisfactorily  completing  the  appropriate  formal  course satisfies  the  requirements  of  this  section.    Approved  in-unit  qualification  training  must  be accomplished IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 1  and the guidance below  (T-2): 3.5.1.  Flying  training  lessons  will    be  completed  sequentially.    If  mission  scheduling  or student  progress  dictates  otherwise,  changes  to  the  in-unit  training  sequences  may  be authorized by the unit operations officer or designated representative.  (T-3). 3.5.2.  Training  on  operational  missions  must  be  conducted  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol.  1,  and AFI 11-2CV-22, Vol. 3.  (T-2).   12  AFI11-2CV-22V1  17 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General  Requirements.  The  requirements  in  this  section  and  the  RTM  satisfy  minimum flying and related ground to maintain currency to the assigned training status.  (T-2).   Unqualified  crewmembers  do  not training 4.1.1.  Applicability. requirements  until  completion  of  qualification/requalification.    Events  completed  on  a satisfactory  qualification  or  mission  qualification  evaluation,  or  certification  event  may  be credited toward currency requirements. log  continuation 4.2.  Training  Levels.  The  use  of  experience  based  flying  training  levels  (FTL)  allows  the squadron commander to prioritize training resources.  Aircrew members must meet the minimum criteria  established  in  Paragraph  4.2.1  and  Table  4.1  before  assignment  to  the  respective training  level.    (T-2).    When  these  minima  are  met,  awarding  a  training  level  is  at  the  sole discretion of the squadron commander or designated representative.  Once a semiannual  period begins, personnel will not be moved to a level requiring fewer events until the next semiannual period.    (T-2).    Note:    The  aircrew  member’s  availability  to  fly  should  not  be  a  factor  in assigning FTL. 4.2.1.  FTLs are based on minimum MV/CV-22 time and total time per Table 4.1. 4.2.1.1.  FTL “A”-Highly experienced CMR/MR/BMC aircrew members. 4.2.1.2.  FTL “B”-Experienced CMR/MR/BMC aircrew members. 4.2.1.3.  FTL “C”-Inexperienced BAQ and BMC/MR/CMR aircrew members. Table 4.1.  FTL Assignment Criteria  (T-2).

MV/CV-22 time includes all categories of flight time logged with exception of “other” time. 4.3.  Prorated Training Requirements.  See AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, as supplemented. 4.4.  Recurrency  and  Requalification  Training.  Training  is  required  whenever  an  aircrew member does not meet a currency requirement in this instruction.  (T-2). 4.4.1.  Loss of Currency.  Aircrew members will receive training under the supervision of an instructor when the requirements listed in the RTM are not met.  (T-2). 4.4.1.1.  Loss of Currency Exceeding 6 Months. Non-currency in designated BAQ events in excess of 6 months results in loss of BAQ.  Non-currency in BMC events excess of 6 months results in loss of mission qualification status.  (T-2). 4.4.1.2.  Loss  of  currency  in  any  mission,  special  mission,  or  instructor  certified  event item  does  not  affect  the  individual's  basic  aircraft  qualification.    Crewmembers  non-current  in  any  mission,  special  mission,  or  instructor  certified  event  may  perform  crew duties  and  log  currency  on  missions  not  involving  the  non-current  item  for  up  to  6 months.  (T-2). 4.4.2.  Regaining  Currency.    Crewmembers  non-current  in  any  BAQ,  mission,  special mission, or instructor  certified events  up to  6 months require performing those items  under the  supervision  of  an  instructor  in  as  many  repetitions  as  necessary  to  demonstrate proficiency  in  each  delinquent  event.    Events  performed  under  the  supervision  of  an instructor can be credited toward applicable currency requirements.  (T-2). 4.4.3.  Requalification Training.  Crewmembers requiring requalification (noncurrent over 6 months)  will  accomplish  training  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol.  1,  applicable  MAJCOM supplements,  Chapter  2,  Chapter  3, and  Chapter  5 of this instruction,  and  the applicable RTM.    Previous  instructors  unqualified  less  than  51  months  may  requalify  directly  to instructor status.  (T-2). 4.4.3.1.  For special mission  and instructor certified event  qualifications, delinquency in any special mission or instructor certification currency requirement does not preclude the crewmember  from  being  mission  qualified.    Non-currency  in  special  mission  items  for more than 6 months renders the individual unqualified for that special mission event.  To requalify  in  that  special  mission,  the  individual  will  complete  all  initial  training  and evaluation  requirements  for that special mission.  (T-2).   For instructor certified events, certification is regained by showing proficiency in that event to an instructor.  Previously qualified instructors may requalify/recertify directly to instructor status in special mission or instructor certified events, if unqualified for a period less than 51 months. 4.4.3.2.  Shipboard  Operations.    Pilots  require  recertification  if  currency  is  exceeded.  FEs, if non-current for 1 year or less, may regain currency by demonstrating proficiency to  an  instructor.    FEs  noncurrent  over  1  year  require  recertification.    For  shipboard operations recurrency, cross-service instructor pilots  (IPs) will be  from  like-MDS (refer to CNO/USSOCOM Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)).  (T-0). 4.5.  Ground Training Requirements.   14  AFI11-2CV-22V1  17 APRIL 2015 4.5.1.  General  Information.    AFI  11-202,  Vol.  1,  and  applicable  RTMs  designate  ground training  requirements  for  all  aircrew  members.    Ground  training  tables  in  the  RTM  specify which  items  are  considered  either  grounding,  result  in  training  status,  or  are  required  for mobility  status.    Unit  commanders  may  add  additional  training  items  to  meet  specific  unit requirements.    Events  are  considered  current  until  the  end  of  the  month  in  which  they  are due.  (T-2). 4.6.  Flying Training. 4.6.1.  Applicability.    BAQ,  BMC,  MR,  or  CMR  crewmembers  will  accomplish  all  of  the applicable events as required in the RTM.  (T-2). 4.6.2.  When to Credit Events.  Training requirements may be completed on any sortie if the requirements of this instruction are met.  Profiles and compatible events may be credited on the same flight. 4.6.2.1.  When more than one event is required, a proportionate share will be completed during  the  training  period  rather  than  finishing  the  total  requirement  on  one  sortie.  Commanders  must  ensure  flying  training  accomplishments  are  spread  as  evenly  as possible over the training period, to ensure maximum aircrew proficiency.  (T-3). 4.6.2.2.  Night  Vision  Goggle  (NVG)  events  may  be  counted  toward  other  similar  day and non-NVG currency events, i.e.,  NVG sortie credits both night sortie and basic sortie requirements. 4.6.2.3.  Logging  Flying  Currency  in  Simulators.    Pilots  and  FEs  may  log  events  in  the simulator as allowed per the RTM. 4.6.2.3.1.  Regaining  Currency  in  a  Simulator.    Individuals  require  an  Air  Force qualified instructor (military or contract) to regain currency in all items that may be logged  in  the  simulator.    Note:    Consecutive  recurrency  in  the  same  event  is  not permitted in the simulator. 4.6.2.3.2.  Simulator Crew Complement.  Simulator crews will consist of the standard crew  complement  for  the  type  of  mission  being  flown,  minus  the  cabin  FE.    (T-3).  Except for EP sorties, BAQ events do not require an FE in the seat. 4.6.3.  Unqualified  Crewmembers.    Unqualified  crewmembers  will  not  log  continuation training  requirements  until  completion  of  qualification/requalification.    (T-2).    Events completed on a satisfactory qualification, mission qualification, or requalification evaluation may be credited toward currency requirements. 4.7.  Multiple Qualifications. 4.7.1.  Multiple  aircraft-qualified  crewmembers  must  complete  100  percent  of the requirements  for  qualification  and  continuation  training.    (T-2).    Basic  qualification requirements  must  be  maintained  in  each  MDS  (Exception:    Basic  qualification  volume requirements in  the RTM may be completed in  a CV-22, MV-22, or the simulator).  (T-2).  Example:    A  sortie  and  instrument  approach  must  be  completed  every  45  days  in  each aircraft  qualified.    Multiple  aircraft-qualified  individuals  maintain  mission  ready  status  by completing 50 percent of the mission requirements for each MDS aircraft in which qualified. AFI11-2CV-22V1  17 APRIL 2015   15  4.7.2.  Procedures for approval  of multiple qualifications are contained in AFI 11-202, Vol. 1, as supplemented and AFI 11-2CV22, Vol. 2. 4.8.  BAQ Event Definitions. 4.8.1.  BAQ Continuation Training Events.  The definitions of required simulator and flying training events to maintain basic qualification in the aircraft are located in the RTM. 4.9.  Mission and Special Mission Definitions and Accrediting Criteria. 4.9.1.  General  Requirements.    If  circumstances  beyond  the  control  of  the  aircrew  prevent completion of all sub-events on a single sortie, those items or events not completed may be accomplished on a subsequent sortie. 4.9.1.1.  Two or more flying currency requirements may be logged on a single flight by all crewmembers accomplishing the required maneuvers. 4.9.1.2.  Pilots must perform the maneuver to log individual currency for that event.  (T-3). 4.9.1.3.  Other  qualified  crewmembers  must  perform  duties  associated  with  their  crew position to log currency.  (T-3). 4.9.2.  Mission Event Definitions.  See current MAJCOM RTM.   16  AFI11-2CV-22V1  17 APRIL 2015 Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General  Requirements.  This  chapter  outlines  the  prerequisites  and  training  requirements for qualified aircrew members upgrading to additional levels of qualification and certification in specialized flight events. 5.2.  Aircraft  Commander  (AC)  Certification.  Pilots  certifying  to  AC  must  meet  the  flying time requirements listed in Table 5.1.    These time limits are the minimum and are not intended to  be  the  standard.    Prerequisite  flying  time  levels  for  AC  certification  are  based  upon  pilots gaining  the  knowledge  and  judgment  required  to  effectively  accomplish  the  unit  mission.  Commanders will ensure continuation training programs emphasize these areas.  (T-2). 5.2.1.  Basic  AC.    This  certification  entitles  pilots  that  have  completed  the  mission qualification course but do not meet the requisite hours in Table 5.1 to perform as AC duties for qual/ instrument and remote operations IAW the RTM.  In addition they may perform AC duties  on  functional  check  flights  (FCF)  and    hot  refueling  operations.    These  pilots  are restricted from performing AC duties for any mission events listed in the RTM.  Pilots that have  only  completed  the  Senior  Officer  BAQ  course  are  restricted  from  performing  AC duties in any capacity. Table 5.1.
