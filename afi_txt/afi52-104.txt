Chaplain  Corps  RSTs  execute  mission  as  directed  by  the  command  and  functional authorities.  The RST must only engage in religious functions, such as providing ministry to the sick and wounded, and spiritual care to the fighting force, which do not violate the provisions of Geneva Conventions I and II.(T-0) 3.1.1.  Chaplain  Conduct.  Chaplains  will  refrain  from  all  activities  that  could  create perceptions of combatant behavior or that compromise the protected status of other chaplains in  the  field.    Chaplains  will  carry  their  Common  Access  Card  (CAC)  as  proof  of  their noncombatant status regarding the Geneva Convention per DoDI 1000.13.  Under the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) it is a violation to use chaplains in any direct military capacity that  jeopardizes a chaplain’s noncombatant status.  Chaplains will not act nor give the appearance of acting as informants, intelligence officers, or political agents.  Chaplains will not take part in psychological operations or in manipulating civilian relationships for political or military motives.  Chaplains do not bear or transport arms or ammunition.  Chaplains will not engage in other traditional combatant activities, e.g., assisting in planning military actions, collecting or conveying military intelligence or directing response to hostile fire. (T-0) 3.1.1.1.  Non-compliance  with  Noncombatant  Status.    A  violation  of  the  chaplain’s obligations as a noncombatant may constitute a breach of duty as well as a failure to meet AF  standards.    Actions  may  be  taken  against  an  offender  and  may  result  in  corrective action  or  punishment  under  the  provisions  of  the  Uniformed  Code  of  Military  Justice (UCMJ) IAW AFI 51-401, Training, and Reporting to Ensure Compliance with the Law of Armed Conflict. 3.1.1.2.  Military Chaplains in  Service to  Detainees or Enemy  Prisoners of War (EPW).  The requirements of the  Geneva Conventions are to  be followed in  the spiritual care of detainees and EPWs (Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, August  12,  1949,  Chapter  V  and  Geneva  Conventions  relative  to  the  Treatment  of Prisoners  of  War,  Article  37).    Military  chaplains  may  assist  and  support  retained religious  leaders  and  appointed  lay  leaders  in  facilitating  the  spiritual  care  of  detainees and/or EPWs as identified by the commander. 3.1.2.  Chaplain  Assistant  Conduct.  Chaplain  Assistants  assist  in  force  protection  for Chaplain  Corps  assets  and  resources,  which  include  chaplains  with  consideration  of  their unique noncombatant LOAC status.

The means to train these forces are described in Chapter 5. Reference the Management Internal Control Toolset (MICT) for the self assessment communicator (SAC) requirements. 3.4.  Chaplain  Corps  Resourcing.  Senior  RSTs  at  deployed  locations  will  ensure  resource requirements are identified in the Ministry Support Plan. (T-3) 3.4.1.  Appropriated  Funds.    Funds  for  mission  support  identified  in  the  Ministry  Support Plan  will  be  provided  by  the  commander  and  used  IAW  AFI  52-105  volume  1,  Chaplain Service  Resourcing, Appropriated Funds and AFI 65-601, volume 1,  Budget  Guidance and Procedures. 3.4.2.  Chapel  Tithes  and  Offering  Funds  (CTOF)  at  deployed  location.    The  collection  of CTOF is prohibited at deployed locations. (T-1) 3.4.3.  Grant  Funds.    Grant  funds,  sourced  by  CTOF,  are  a  one-time  request  based  on  the number  of  Chaplain  Corps  personnel  assigned  to  a  deployed  location.    Additional information on obtaining and utilizing funds is found in AFI 52-105 volume 2, Chapel Tithes and Offering Fund (CTOF). 3.5.  Major  Accident  or  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear  and  High  Yield Explosives (CBRNE Role).  Chaplains and chaplain assistants support the all-hazards approach to  incident  response.    These  threats  and  hazards  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  major accidents,  natural  and  man-made  disasters,  enemy  attacks  with  CBRNE  and  conventional weapons or materials.  (T-2) 3.5.1.  The primary role of Chaplain Corps personnel is to support authorized Department of Defense (DOD) personnel during incident response. 3.5.1.1.  Air National Guard (ANG) Chaplain Corps personnel under state control provide religious support to non-DOD personnel in accordance with ANG guidance applicable to those forces. 3.5.1.2.  All commanders have the authority to request religious support for an immediate response to support the religious and spiritual needs of command personnel. 3.5.2.  The safety of AF personnel is a primary consideration during incidents.  RSTs must do everything possible to prevent becoming casualties while seeking to provide spiritual care to victims.    RSTs  will  normally  operate  in  a  secure,  decontaminated  area  (cold  zone),  unless inside  a  collective  protected  facility  or  in  the  appropriate  Mission-Oriented  Protective Posture  (MOPP)  level  for  the  contamination  threat.    (T-1)  RSTs  will  communicate  through appropriate chain of command while responding. (T-3)   14  AFI52-104  6 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 4 WING/INSTALLATION READINESS ENVIRONMENT (TACTICAL) 4.1.  In-Garrison Expeditionary Site Plan.  The in-garrison expeditionary site plan (IGESP) is the installation-level planning document (see AFI 10-404, Base Support and Expeditionary Site Planning).  The  Wing/Installation  senior  RST  will  annually  review/update  the  Chaplain  Corps portion  of  the  IGESP.  (T-3)  The  Chapel  Contingency  and  Emergency  Support  OI  and  IGESP will be exercised annually and/or to meet unit requirements. (T-1) 4.2.  Workplace  Violence,  Major  Accidents,  Mass  Casualty  Response,  Natural  Disasters, National Emergencies, and Humanitarian Support.  Chaplain Corps personnel have a critical role  in  responding  to  workplace  violence,  major  accidents,  mass  casualty  events,  natural disasters,  national  emergencies,  and  humanitarian  support.    Chaplain  Corps  personnel  provide spiritual care to survivors, their dependents and to the dependents of casualties. (T-0) Providing crisis  counseling  to  the  emergency  responders  and  advice  to  commanders  on  issues  that  may arise during the subsequent investigation can also be expected. 4.2.1.  Chaplain Corps personnel may be directly involved in the installation effort to support the  surrounding  community  in  response  to  a  natural  disaster.  The  wing/installation  senior RST  develops  a  plan  to  determine  the  level  of  support  provided  to  the  community  while continuing to accomplish the wing/installation mission. (T-3) 4.2.2.  Chaplain Corps personnel identify manning shortfalls where military personnel cannot fully  support  mass  casualty  events.    If  resource  personnel  (as  defined  in  AFI  52-101)  are utilized to support mass casualty events, ensure they are equipped and trained. (T-1) 4.2.3.  Assess  resource  personnel  and  identify  those  who  are  trained  for  mass  casualty response events and appropriately resource as needed. AFI52-104  6 AUGUST 2015   15  Chapter 5 CHAPLAIN CORPS TRAINING PHASES 5.1.

definitions of terms. Terms Administrative  Control  (ADCON)—  Direction  or  exercise  of  authority  over  subordinate  or other  organizations  in  respect  to  administration  and  support,  including  organization  of  Service forces, control of resources and equipment, personnel management, unit logistics, individual and unit training, readiness, mobilization, demobilization, discipline, and other matters not included in the operational missions of the subordinate or other organizations.  (JP 1-02) Chapel  Tithes  and  Offerings  Fund  (CTOF)—  Cash  and  other  assets  received  within  Armed Forces religious communities as the expression of one’s faith. Command and Control (C2)— The exercise of authority and direction by a properly designated commander over assigned and attached forces in the accomplishment of the mission. Command and  control  functions  are  performed  through  an  arrangement  of  personnel,  equipment, communications,  facilities,  and  procedures  employed  by  a  commander  in  planning,  directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1-02). Emergency  Responders—  The  response  elements  of  a  Disaster  Response  Force  (DRF)  that deploy  to  the  accident  scene  after  the  First  Responders  to  expand  C2  and  perform  support functions.  Emergency  Responders  include  follow-on  elements  such  as  firefighters,  law enforcement  personnel,  security  personnel,  emergency  medical technicians,  emergency management  personnel,  EOD  personnel,  physicians,  nurses,  medical  treatment  providers  at medical  treatment  facilities,  public  health  officers,  bioenvironmental  engineering  personnel, mortuary affairs personnel and include any specialized teams. Not all Emergency Responders are First Responders, but all First Responders are Emergency Responders.  Emergency Responders are not assigned to additional duties that will conflict with their emergency duties. Grant  Funds—  Funding  supplemental  to  appropriated  funds,  which  are  sourced  from  CTOF resources.    This  funding  may  only  be  requested  one  time  by  the  deployed  RST,  usually  at  the beginning of the deployment. Low Density/High Demand (HD/LS)— Limited assets/forces with unique mission capabilities stressed by continual high OPTEMPO because of Combatant Commander requirements. AFI52-104  6 AUGUST 2015   21  Individual  Augmentee  (IA)—  Individual  Augmentation  represents  unfunded  temporary  duty positions  (military  or  civilian)  requested  to  augment  a  supported  combatant  commander’s  or governmental  agencies  staff  operations  during  contingencies.    Similar  to  requests  for  forces (RFFs) in support of contingencies, IA requirements are inherently temporary in nature and are not to be used to solve permanent manning or capability shortages (see AFI 10-401 for additional information on IAs). Joint  Expeditionary  Tasking  (JET)—  When  a  standard  force  solution  (i.e.  a  mission  ready, Joint  capable  force  with  associated  table  of  organization  and  equipment  executing  its  core mission) cannot  be made, the Joint Force Provider (JFP) may recommend a non-standard force solution.  While the Joint Staff has defined three categories of non-standard force solutions, the AF  collectively  refers  to  its  contribution  to  these  as  JET.    A  JET  sourcing  solution  becomes  a factor  when  the  traditional  force  provider  for  the  requested  force  or  capability  cannot  fill  the requirement or there is no traditional force provider.  (see AFI 10-401 for additional information on JETs) Mission Capability (MISCAP)— A short paragraph that describes the capability a specific unit type code is expected to have at execution.  The statement usually contains pertinent information such  as  type  base  to  be  deployed  to,  functions  included,  and  other  augmentation  requirements necessary to conduct specific missions. Noncombatant  Evacuation  Operation (NEO)— Operations  directed  by  the  Department  of State,  the  Department  of  Defense,  or  other  appropriate  authority  whereby  noncombatants    are evacuated from areas of danger overseas to safe havens or to the United States. Operational  Control  (OPCON)—  Operational  control  normally  provides  full  authority  to organize  commands  and  forces  and  to  employ  those  forces  as  the  commander  in  operational control considers necessary to accomplish assigned missions; it does not, in and of itself, include authoritative direction for logistics or matters of administration, discipline, internal organization, or unit training. Operations  Tempo  (OPSTEMPO)—  A  readiness  term  referring  to  the  number  of  hours personnel are working in support of military operations. Personnel  Reclama—  When  a  wing/tasked  unit/installation  cannot  meet  an  individual augmentee tasking, they will request relief by submitting a personnel reclama through the local manpower and military personnel flight to the CRF. Personnel Tempo (PERSTEMPO)— A readiness term referring to length of time personnel are TDY from their home base in support of military operations. Reachback—  The  process  of  obtaining  products,  services,  and  applications  or  forces, equipment,  or  material  from  AF  organizations  that  are  not  forward  deployed.    This  capability allows  commanders  to  obtain  or  coordinate  support  from  units  not  physically  located  with  the forward  force.  By  leveraging  advances  in  communications  technology,  reachback  capabilities make it possible to utilize CONUS and/or rear-based assets and organizations to perform various functions in  support of  AEF operations.   Effective use of reachback will reduce the number of personnel  and  amount  of  equipment,  which  deploys  to  the  AOR,  reduce  airlift  and  support requirements,  and  will  positively  impact  a  commander’s  ability  to  protect  the  deployed  force. Reachback  is  predicated  on  global  communications,  rapid  global  mobility,  and  time-definite resupply capabilities.   22  AFI52-104  6 AUGUST 2015 Ready  Reserve—  The  Selected  Reserve,  Individual  Ready  Reserve,  and  Inactive  National Guard  liable  for  active  duty  as  prescribed  by  law  (US  Code,  Title  10  (DOD),  sections  10142, 12301, and 12302). Required  Delivery  Date  (RDD)—  A  date,  relative  to  CDAY,  when  a  unit  must  arrive  at  its destination and complete off-loading to properly support the concept of operations (JP 1-02). Religious Support Team (RST)— A team that is composed of an AF chaplain and AF chaplain assistant.  The  team  works  together  in  designing,  implementing,  and  executing  the  command religious program (AFI 52-101 and JP 1-05). Tactical  Control  (TACON)—  The  detailed  and  usually  local  direction  and  control  of movements or maneuvers necessary to accomplish missions or tasks assigned (JP 1-02). Time  Phased  Force  and  Deployment  Data  (TPFDD)—  The  JOPES  data  base  portion  of  an operation  plan  contains  time-phased  force  data,  non-unit-related  cargo  and  personnel  data,  and movement data for the operational plan, including: in-place units, units to be deployed to support the operation plan with  a priority indicating the desired sequence for their arrival at the port of debarkation, routing of forces to be deployed, movement data associated with deploying forces, estimates of non-unit-related cargo and personnel movements to be conducted concurrently with the  deployment  of  forces,  and  estimate  of  transportation  requirements  that  must  be  fulfilled  by common-user lift resources as well. Total Mobilization— Expansion of the active Armed Forces resulting from action by Congress and the President to organize and/or generate additional units or personnel, beyond the existing force structure, and the resources needed for requirements of a war or other national emergency involving an external threat to the national security. Unit  Line  Number  (ULN)—  A  seven-character  alphanumeric  code  that  uniquely  describes  a unit entry (line) in a JOPES TPFDD (JP 1-03.2). Unit Type Code (UTC)— A five-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies each type unit of the Armed Forces (JP 1-02). UTC  Shortfall—  When  a  wing/installation  tasked  does  not  possess  sufficient  qualified personnel  to  support  a  UTC  tasking,  they  will  request  relief  by  submitting  a  UTC  shortfall request from the installation deployment office to their MAJCOM operation plans or deployment office. This request will be coordinated with the local manpower office and MPF.  There are two types  of  personnel  UTC  shortfalls:  a  wing/installation  cannot  support  the  entire  UTC  and  a wing/installation can support part of the tasked UTC,  but  cannot  fill  one  or more of the AFSC requirements within the UTC. War and Mobilization Plan (WMP)— Provides the Air Staff and AF commanders with current polices  and  planning  factors  for  conducting  and  supporting  wartime  operations.  It  establishes requirements  for  developing  mobilization  and  planning  programs  for  industrial  production  to support sustained contingency operations of the programmed forces (WMP-1).  AFI52-104  6 AUGUST 2015   23  Attachment 2 CHAPLAIN CORPS CONTINGENCY AND EMERGENCY SUPPORT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTION (OI) Prepare Contingency and Emergency Support Operating Instruction per unit-level guidance and IAW AFI 33-360.
