Course provided by Air Force Safety Center, Kirtland AFB, NM. Airfield Operations—All ATC, AM, ATCALS, airfield and associated functions supporting the flying  mission  at  a  particular  location.  Although  normally  centered  on  a  single,  terminal environment, this may include enroute control, range complexes and multiple airfields. Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)—CFETP  is  a  comprehensive  core-training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements; training support resources,  and  minimum  core  task  requirements  for  a  specialty.  The  CFETP  aims  to  give personnel  a  clear  path  and  instill  a  sense  of  industry  in  career  field  training.  It  is  the  formal training contract between the AF Career Field Manager and AETC for formal accession and life-cycle skills training. Compliance  Inspection—Inspections  conducted  to  assess  areas  mandated  by  law  as  well  as mission areas that are critical or important to the health and performance of organizations; failure to comply with the established directives in these areas could result in legal liabilities, penalties, or mission impact. Control  Tower  Operator  (CTO)—Includes  local  control,  ground  control  and  flight  data positions. Controlled  Movement  Area  (CMA)—As  defined  in  Airfield  Operations  Instructions,  any portion  of  the  airfield  requiring  aircraft,  vehicles  and  pedestrians  to  obtain  specific  Air  Traffic Control  approval  for  access  (normally  via  two-way  radio  contact  with  the  control  tower).  Controlled Movement Areas include but are not limited to areas used for takeoff, landing and as AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010   29  required taxiing of aircraft.  Note: This definition is used in lieu of "movement area" as defined in the FAA Pilot Controller Glossary. Also called CMA. Controlled  Movement  Area  Violation  (CMAV)  Event—An  airfield  infraction  caused  by aircraft,  vehicles,  or  pedestrians  entering  the  control  movement  area  without  specific  control tower  approval.  This  definition  includes  Runway  Incursions  (RI)  and  infractions  caused  by communication errors.

Additional services are provided within  system  capability.  A  controller  assigned  to  the  radar  final  control  position  (called  the radar final controller) normally provides this service. Runway  Incursion—Any  occurrence  at  an  aerodrome  involving  the  incorrect  presence  of  an aircraft, vehicle or person on the protected area of a surface designated for the landing and take-off of  aircraft.   For the  purpose of this instruction, the protected area is  the same as the CMA. These are further classified into three operational categories: 1)    Operational  Error  (OE)—A failure of the  air traffic control system that results in  loss of separation. 2)  Pilot Deviation (PD)—The action of a pilot that results in the violation of ATC instructions, AFIs and/or FARs. 3)    Vehicle/Pedestrian  Deviation  (V/PD)—Any  entry  or  movement  on  the  controlled movement area by a vehicle (including aircraft operated by non-pilots) or pedestrian that has not been authorized by Air Traffic Control. Special Interest Item (SII)—An area of focus for management; used to gather data and assess the status of specific programs and conditions in the field.   30  AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010 Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS)—An  Air  Force  publication  that  describes  an  Air  Force specialty  in  terms  of  tasks  and  knowledge  that  an  airman  in  that  specialty  may  be  expected  to perform and identifies the training provided to achieve a 3-, 5-, or 7-skill level within an enlisted Air  Force  specialty.  It  further  serves  as  a  contract  between  Air  Education  and  Training Command  and  the  functional  user  to  show  the  overall  training  requirements  for  an  Air  Force Specialty Code that are taught in formal schools and correspondence schools.  AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010   31  Attachment 2 SAMPLE ATSEP REPORT  (DELETED)     32  AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010 Attachment 3 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (WHEN FILLED) SAMPLE AFRSAT REPORT UNITED STATES AIR FORCE RUNWAY SAFETY ACTION TEAM REPORT  Blank AFB, 27-31 July 2010  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (When filled)  Section I - Executive Summary  Purpose and Scope: This AFRSAT visit was initiated as a result of Blank AFB having the third highest number of runway incursions in 2009.  It included:  an evaluation of management of the airfield driving program; air traffic and flight procedures; airfield infrastructure, Squadron Airfield Driving Program Management (ADPM) and Wing Safety.  This report includes recommendations proposed to the Wing/CC to help reduce the number of runway incursions. Overview: Blank AFB has adequate procedures in place to promote runway safety.  All units and agencies interviewed displayed a high level of experience and knowledge of the runway incursion problem.  Personnel expressed significant interest in reducing the number of runway incursions, and welcomed any inputs by the team.  Blank AFB is a 24/7 airfield, averaging more than 55K runway operations per a year.  There are multiple types of aircraft missions; helicopter operations, unmanned aircraft, fighter and mobility operations. Assigned aircraft include C-130s, and B-1s.    Wing Leadership: The Wing leadership is keenly aware of their runway incursion trend and have aggressively implemented several measures that have already shown progress in reducing the number of runway incursions.  The following actions have been taken:    1.  Installed runway guard lights at taxiway Hotel at Runway 36 and  repainted airfield markings 2.  Created a Runway Incursion Board to evaluate runway incursions and make recommendations for improvements.  3.  Initiated project to build perimeter road around the approach end of Runway 24.  Airfield Configuration: Blank AFB has three runways: runways 18R/36L, 18L/36R and 6/24.  Runway 6/24 is the primary instrument runway.   Runway 6 and 36L cross each other at their approach end.  Aircraft must taxi across runway 36L on taxiway Hotel to get to the approach end of Runway 6 and normally taxi down Runway 6 to takeoff the full length of runway 36L.  This particular intersection (36L & Hotel) contributed to 45% of all runways.  Another “Hot Spot” for runway incursions is access to the Army Ramp on the South side of the airfield.  For vehicles to get to where the Army helicopters are parked, drivers must cross the approach end of Runway AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010   33  24.  This crossing accounted for 30% of all runway incursions.  See airfield diagram, Attachment 1.     Air Traffic Control: The control tower provides excellent view of all runways.  The height of the Control Tower, and it’s location from the runways are adequate.  An almost constant flow of aircraft and vehicular traffic emphasize the need for positive control and keen situational awareness by the controllers. Controllers received additional training on Controlled Movement Area Violations (CMAV) /Runway Incursions, and incorporated a “Lessons Learned” document for all controllers to review in the facilities Recent Information File (RIF).  Controllers are keenly aware of the runway incursion potential and pay particular attention to runway crossing procedures to ensure the safety of operations while meeting the flying mission requirements.     Airfield Management: Airfield Management is effectively managing the Airfield Driving Training Program and airfield safety.  The Airfield Manager and Deputy Airfield Manager have taken positive steps to improve training of airfield drivers and improve airfield markings and signs.  Runway incursions are briefed at the Airfield Operations Board.  The Wing’s Airfield Driving Program is extremely large and challenging with 40 units.  Currently, Airfield Management tests all airfield drivers.  On average more than 200 personnel are tested each month.  There were several areas discovered should be improved on the airfield to include airfield markings and signs.  The Airfield Driving Training Program was adequate, however several changes are recommended to improve the overall management of the program and the training of airfield drivers.   Airfield Driving Program Managers: The team evaluated 20 unit airfield driving training programs and found that 20% were not managing their program in accordance with local guidance.  More than 50 drivers were checked for AF IMT 483 and several drivers were discovered did not have them.  The units ADPMs were notified and an investigation into those organizations found several problems with personnel in-processing, lack of supervision involvement and program management.  Section II – Trend Analysis  A thorough analysis was conducted of all CMAVs and Hazardous Air Traffic Reports (HATRs) runway incursions that occurred over the past five years (Figure A3.1).  In 2009, Blank AFB had a 9% increase in the number of runway incursions from 2008.  Thus far in 2010, there have already been 12 runway incursions with five months left in this year.     34  AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010 Figure A3.1.  Blank AFB Runway Incursion Trends. Historically, the months of June, September, and November are peak months for runway incursions.  These time frames appear to be high traffic periods due to scheduled exercises and the influx of new and inexperienced airfield drivers significantly contributes to the increase in incursions. (Figure A3.2)  Figure A3.2.  Runway Incursions by Month. Similar to Air Force trend data, Aircraft Maintenance, Security Forces and Civil Engineering have committed the most runway incursions on the airfield (54%).  These organizations have the majority of the airfield drivers and due to the airfield layout are required to cross the runways at several locations to perform their duties.  There are currently no specialized briefings or training provided to these high risk installations. ( Figure A3.3)      AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010   35  Figure A3.3.  Blank AFB 2008- 2009 Runway Incursion Violators. Section III - Problems and Recommendations  Airfield:  1. Problem: Several runway hold position sign’s internal lighting was inoperative for extended periods.  Taxiway A1 is missing a runway hold sign.  Also, the runway hold sign is not collocated with the runway hold marking at several locations.  Work orders and NOTAMs are submitted to correct/mitigate these problems.      Recommendation:  Immediately repair runway hold signs.  Ensure a bench stock of replacement parts is available to repair frequent outages.  Install runway hold sign on taxiway A1.  Ensure a runway hold sign is installed adjacent to all runway hold lines.        2.  Problem:  Several runway hold line markings are faded, non-reflective or barely visible on taxiways leading to runway 18L/36R.  In addition, several old runway hold lines have been blacked out instead of being removed, thus leading to confusion on where the actual hold lines are located.   IAW AFI 32-1042, runway hold lines cannot be blacked out, they must be removed.    Recommendation: As required, repaint new runway hold lines and markings for Runway 18L/36R and other taxiways and aprons.  Immediately contract or gain the capability to remove old runway hold lines.  Consider power washing runway hold line markings that are barely visible due to dirt obscuring the marking.    Air Traffic Control: 3. Problem:  Several phraseology errors were consistently noted. Specifically, phraseology pertaining to observed abnormalities and intra-facility coordination for runway crossings.    Recommendation: Increased training and facility management oversight is required to reduce   36  AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010 and  identified these coordination and phraseology errors.  Ensure phraseology used is IAW FAAO JO 7110.65, Ch 2-7, 9 & 10.      4.  Problem: Construction floodlights create a glare in the Control Tower reducing visibility of controllers.  Recommendation:  CE and Airfield Operations must ensure there is close coordination with the Control Tower before starting construction projects using floodlights for night operations.    Airfield Management: 5. Problem: Procedures are not developed for contractor personnel to receive training on airfield safety and airfield driving requirements before work can commence on the airfield.  Recommendation: Ensure these procedures are not delineated in airfield construction contracts. 6. Problem: There is limited use of local resources to educate/inform airfield users on runway incursion prevention.   Recommendation: Utilize local resources, base paper, bulletins, commander’s channel, locally developed posters/advertisements, etc. to provide updates, promote runway incursion prevention and lessons learned information to airfield drivers.    Airfield Driving: 7. Problem: Training criteria and procedures for issuing AF 483s are not included in the current airfield driving instruction. Recommendation: Immediately rewrite the airfield driving instruction and ensure compliance with AFI 13-213.   8. Problem: Not all airfield drivers are completing all local training required by local Airfield Driving Instruction (ADI) or supplemental messages.  The Blank AFB Airfield Driving PowerPoint slide presentation and training video are not clearly delineated as required trainings item for all airfield drivers.   Recommendation: Immediately provide all official training material to ADPMs.  Ensure all training requirements are specifically identified in Blank AFB ADI, to include any local video training, PowerPoint slides, etc.   9. Problem: Not all vehicles operating in the Controlled Movement Area (CMA) have mobile radios installed in the vehicle.   Recommendation: To the maximum extent possible, require the installation of mobile radios in all vehicles that routinely operate in the CMAs.  Use handheld radios as a backup.  Ensure all personnel who operate a vehicle on the runway and CMA are trained on how to operate radios and effectively communicate with ATC.     AFI13-204V2  1 SEPTEMBER 2010   37  10. Problem: No checklists are being used to complete the day and night orientations or practical airfield drivers test.    Recommendation:  Develop and utilize a checklist for airfield driver trainers to use when conducting the airfield driving orientations and practical driving test.  A checklist will ensure all airfield drivers are shown all required areas of the airfield and complete all required training during practical drivers test.

REFERENCE:  CFR Part 77,  UFC 3-260-01   or applicable ICAO, NATO or STANAG standards. 7.1.  Are all airfield and base obstructions identified and documented?  Note:  Contact the Community Planner and TERPS for assistance in making this  determination. 7.2.  Are all obstructions allowed (permissible deviations) or waived? Are they  properly marked and lighted? 7.3.  Are all permissible deviations sited and constructed in accordance with applicable criteria?  If not, has a temporary waiver been submitted? Section 8.    Arresting Systems.  REFERENCE:  AFI 32-1043, AFH 32-1084, UFC 3-260-01 or applicable  ICAO, NATO or STANAG standards. 8.1.  Are unidirectional systems and nets located no closer than 35 feet from the  threshold of the runway?  Note:  Runway threshold markings begin 20 feet  inboard of the full strength pavement; therefore, do not install a unidirectional  system within 55 feet of the threshold markings. 8.2.    Are energy absorbers (except BAK-13 and ships’ anchor chains) located  below grade or at least 275 feet from the centerline of the runway pavement?  BAK-13 installations may be as close as 150 feet from runway edge if installed in  a semi permanent configuration.  BAK-12 systems require 290 meters (950 feet),  or 366 meters (1,200 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for unobstructed run out  (See FLIP to determine configuration at your base).  BAK-13 systems require 290  meters (950 feet) plus the length of the aircraft for unobstructed run out.  (Note:  Runout from one system must not conflict with the cross-runway location of  another system.) 8.3.    Are paved transitions and buried crushed stone ramps provided around the  arresting system components located on the runway shoulders? Is the area over  the fairlead tube finished to a grade of 1V: 30H or flatter? See AFI 32-1043 for  additional information. 8.4.   Do the shelters used for above-grade systems comply with the requirement in  AFI 32-1043 and UFC 3-260-01, Section 13? 8.5.  Is the minimum effective pendant height greater than 1.5 inches?  If the effective pendant height is 1.75 inches or less has a repair action been initiated?  If  the effective pendent height is less than 1.5 inches, has an emergency repair been  initiated? 8.6.  Do aircraft arresting systems meet location and siting requirements?                   8.7.  Do arresting system cables have proper tension, doughnut spacing, and tie-  downs?  Are there any broken tie downs? 8.8.  Is the pavements type the same in the critical area (the center 75 feet of pavement within 200 feet on either side of the cable)?  Exception:  This does not  apply to installation of sacrificial polyethylene panels or to emergency systems  located within the overrun. 8.9.  Is the pavement within 200 feet either side of the cable free of excessive paint  build up that could cause a tail hook skip? Section 9.  Other Hazards.
