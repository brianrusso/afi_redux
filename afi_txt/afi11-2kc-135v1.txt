KC-135  Boom  Operator  Weapons Systems  Trainer  (BOWST)  and  Boom  Operator  Simulation  System  (BOSS)  gain/maintain Air  Refueling  Airplane  Simulator  Qualification  (ARASQ)  Level  1  Certification.    Each simulator  has  unique  conditions  and  maintenance  actions  that  require  the  device  to gain/lose/regain  certification by DET 2 AMCAOS or their equivalent  NGB representatives.  These actions have  a direct  impact  on flight  events  creditable in  the  ATD (Table  4.3,   4.4, and  4.5). 1.4.9.1.  Units  who  require  currency  updates  should  check  with  their  host  ATD  site manager for latest status. 1.4.9.2.  ATD  Motion  Requirements.    For  crewmembers  to  log  flying  training  events motion  systems  must  be  used  unless  otherwise  specified  (see  Chapter  4  tables  for simulator creditable events).  KC-135 OFTs modified with motion systems are capable of dramatic  change  in  pitch  and  roll  sufficient  to  cause  occupants  to  be  injured  if  not secured.    When  training  or  conducting  tours  aboard  the  ATD  equipped  with  motion systems, if motion is applied, all parties aboard will occupy a seat and wear the seatbelt; the  Instructor  Operator  Station  (IOS)  will  have  a  certified  operator  (see  Paragraph 5.6.5).    If  the  amount  of  people  in  the  ATD  exceeds  the  amount  of  seats  or  a  certified operator is not aboard, do not use motion. 1.5.  Waiver Authority. 1.5.1.

Guest  Instructors  are  approved  (verbal  approval  is acceptable) by the 509 WPS/CC. 1.10.3.  When  performing  crewmember  duties,  the  following  personnel  will  be  under  direct supervision of an Instructor of like specialty: 1.10.3.1.  All non-current crewmembers.  Direct  Instructor supervision is required while performing the non-current event (see Paragraph 4.9.3.1.1). 1.10.3.2.  All  crewmembers  in  initial  qualification  flying  training  unless  syllabus  states that direct supervision is not required. 1.10.3.3.  All  crewmembers  in  upgrade  training  accomplishing  upgrade  training  events during  critical  phases  of  flight,  unless  the  syllabus  states  that  direct  supervision  is  not required. 1.10.3.4.  All  crewmembers  in  requalification  flying  training  during  critical  phases  of flight, unless the syllabus states that direct supervision is not required. 1.10.3.5.  See Paragraph 5.3.5.1 for MPD requirements. 1.10.3.6.  All crewmembers designated by the Wg/CC, OG/CC, or Sq/CC. 1.10.4.  All  unqualified,  upgrading,  or  FTL-E  crewmembers  require  direct  Instructor supervision during all critical-phases-of-flight in the aircraft. 1.10.5.  Only  designated  ATS  contractors  or  Sq/CC  certified  USAF  crewmembers  may operate an OFT or BOWST/BOSS, as appropriate (see Paragraph 5.6.5). 1.11.  Distribution.  Units will establish distribution requirements of this AFI. 1.12.  Transfer  of  Aircrews.  Before a crewmember will interfly  from one unit to  another, the gaining unit will review and assess their qualification and currency.  See also AFI 11-401. 1.12.1.  A  crewmember  qualified  in  the  same  Mission-Design  Series  (MDS)  according  to AFI 11-202V2 (e.g., KC-135R/T) will be considered qualified throughout the USAF KC-135 force  with  the  same  MDS-model  and  mission.    Certified/qualified  MR  crewmember transferring between units, accomplish only unit specific training and any applicable events in  which  they  have  lost  currency.    See  AFI  11-2KC-135V3,  Chapter  3,  Interfly,  for additional information. 1.12.2.  For  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  training  and/or  exchange  officers,  see  training requirements in  AFI 11-401.   Initial and/or continuation training requirements are specified AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 19 in  the  appropriate  MOU,  OPLAN,  agreements  and  International  Program  Directives  (IPD) and should mirror training requirements of this AFI to maximum extent possible. 1.13.  Aircrew  Training  While  DNIF.  Crewmembers  whose  status  is  designated,  “Duty  Not Involving  Flying  (DNIF),”  may  log  ground  training  events,  including  simulator  training,  if  the member’s  physical  condition  allows  it.    Consult  the  Flight  Surgeon  initiating  AF  Form  1042, Medical  Recommendation  for  Flying  or  Special  Operational  Duty,  if  the  DNIF  status  includes ground training limitations IAW AFI 48-123, Medical Examinations and Standards. 1.14.  Aircrew Rated Management Overview. 1.14.1.  Programmed Flying Training (PFT).  AETC/A3R or AMC/A3T fulfills  the training command’s  role  IAW  AFI  11-202V1.    A  key  product  of  this  process  is  the  PFT.  The  PFT balances  available  training  quotas,  ATS  throughput,  schoolhouse  capacities  and  course requirements on a Fiscal Year basis.  Annually, units will send projected PFT requirements to their respective MAJCOM quota managers, who in turn compile and forward projections to AF/A3XI,  for  inclusion  into  the  Graduate  Program  Requirements  Document  (GPRD).  Training  commands  will  determine  training  capacity  and  report  shortfall  in  the  GPRD  to AF/A3XI. 1.14.1.1.  AF/A3XI sponsors an annual PFT conference for attendees to balance training capacity,  MAJCOM  training  requests,  and  pipeline  Undergraduate  Flying  Training students  (Rated  and  CEA)  against  Formal  Training  Unit  (FTU)  capacity.    The  training command  allocates  approved  quotas  to  user  commands,  which  in-turn  allocate  training quotas to subordinate units.  The training command publishes the annual PFT document. 1.14.1.2.  Throughout  the  training  year,  MAJCOM  training  staff  and  PFT  managers  use assigned/allocated  training  quotas  to  assign  individual  crewmembers  to  formal  training quotas.    Daily  student  quota  adjustments  to  the  annual  PFT  are  made  on  quota management worksheets.

If  a  student  fails  to  progress  according  to syllabus  or  training  requirements,  the  command  accomplishing  the  training  will  conduct  a Progress  Review  (PR)  IAW  AFI  11-202V1.    Exception:  The  509  WPS  will  follow  USAFWS policies. 1.17.  Career  Enlisted  Aviator  (CEA)  Skill  Levels.  CEAs  are  not  tied  to  AFI  36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel  (Officer and Enlisted),  skill  level  upgrade.  All  enlisted aircrew qualifications are separate and distinct from skill level qualification.  Flight evaluations result in an AF Form 8, Certificate of Aircrew Qualification, IAW AFI 11-202V2.  After an AF Form 8 is completed for the applicable flight evaluation, the crewmember is qualified to perform all duties assigned  to  that  crew  qualification  regardless  of  skill  level.    Aircrew  Instructor  and  flight examiner  (FE)  qualifications  are  also  separate  and  distinct  from  OJT  trainer  or  certifier designation and are reflected in AFSC by use of “K” prefix (aircrew Instructor) and “Q” prefix (standardization  and  evaluation  flight  examiner)  IAW  AFI  36-2101,  Classifying  Military Personnel  (Officer  and  Enlisted),  as  well  as  the  Air  Force  Officer  Classification  Directory (AFOCD) and Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD). 1.18.  Aircrew  Training  Quota  Management.  The  following  describes  AMC's  quota management policy  and  procedures.  Mandatory  for all  AMC  units; all other units follow their MAJCOM guidance. 1.18.1.  Wing training offices (OSS/OST) will submit the rank, full name, SSAN, course, and class  number  via  e-mail  to  AMC/A3TF  NLT  45  days  prior  to  class  start  date  (CSD).  Training  quotas  not  filled  45  days  prior  to  CSD  will  be  offered  to  the  next  unit  on  the AMC/A3TF  standby  list.    Training  offices  should  confirm  all  scheduled  training  with  their units at least 10 days prior to CSD to ensure training notification, ADSC acknowledgement statement, and orders were properly issued. 1.18.1.1.  All  course  prerequisites  should  be  completed  NLT  30  days  prior  to  CSD  to allow  for  remedial  training  or  substitution.    Units  will  internally  identify  an  alternate candidate for each allocated quota.  If the primary candidate becomes unavailable, send AMC/A3TF a substitution request with the alternate's information. 1.18.1.2.  Foreign  exchange  officers  cannot  be  locally  substituted  (they  must  also  be identified when submitted to load against an allocation), send the replacement's full data to AMC/A3TF. 1.18.1.3.  Return all unused quotas to AMC/A3TF NLT 45 days prior to CSD. 1.18.1.4.  All  no-shows  and  cancellations  within  7  days  of  CSD  must  be  explained.  Forward an initial report of circumstances to the AMC/A3TF Quota Manager within 24 hours  of  notification.    The  initial  notification  will  be  followed  by  a  memorandum  of explanation from the OG/CC to AMC/A3T within one week.  Please send the e-mail to:  AMC.A3T@us.af.mil and courtesy copy the appropriate AMC/A3TF Quota Manager. 1.18.1.5.  Send  requests  for  additional  quotas  to  AMC/A3TF.    If  unit  capability  is  in jeopardy,  AMC/A3TF  will  coordinate  with  Air  Staff  and  AETC  to  add  or  reallocate additional  quotas.    AMC/A3TF  quota  managers  will  coordinate  with  the  wing  training offices  (OSS/OST)  exclusively.    Squadrons  or  individuals  will  be  referred  to  their  OSS training  office.    Please  submit  the  name/phone  number/e-mail  for  the  primary  and alternate point of contact for quota management in wing training office. AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 21 1.18.1.6.  AMC  units  are  prohibited  from  coordinating  quota  exchanges  with  other commands.    OSS/OST  training  offices  will  forward  all  requests  to  the  AMC  quota manager for coordination with other commands.  Please allow for extended coordination time when considering this option. 1.18.2.  HQ AMC Orientation Tour / GRACC.

General  Requirements.  AFI 11-202 Volume 1 defines initial qualification training.  This chapter  specifies  the  minimum  training  requirements  for  initial  qualification,  re-qualification, conversion/difference  qualification,  and  senior  officer  courses.    The  primary  method  for  initial qualification and requalification training is to attend and complete the appropriate formal training course  listed  in  the  ETCA.    When  a  formal  training  course  (quota)  is  not  available,  units  may request  a  waiver  to  conduct  in-unit  qualification  training  using  formal  school  courseware  (See Paragraph 1.5.6.). 2.2.  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT)  Prerequisites.  Complete  initial  qualification prerequisites IAW AFI 11-202V1, this publication, and the course syllabus.  See Chapter 6 for formal IQT course listing and prerequisites in Table 5.1. 2.3.  Ground  Training  Requirements  .    Complete  ground  training  requirements  for  initial qualification  IAW  AFI  11-202V1  and  this  instruction.    During  formal  training,  aircrews  may complete  and  receive  credit  for  Mobility  Training  and  Ancillary  Training  events  in  Table  4.2.  See the appropriate formal training course syllabus. 2.3.1.  The events in Table 2.1 should be accomplished at the FTU.   If events  in Table 2.1 are not accomplished at the FTU, they must be completed at the gaining unit.  The FTU will provide  the  gaining  unit  with  documentation  indicating  completion  of  items  in  Table  2.1 using standard ARMS Event Identifiers.  If in-unit training is accomplished in lieu of formal school attendance, unit is responsible for ensuring all requirements are completed. 2.3.2.  Ground  training  events  accomplished  during  formal  training  will  use  the  course completion  date  to  establish  the  due  dates  for  all  subsequent  currency  and  requirements.  Completion  of  initial  Survival,  Evasion,  Resistance,  and  Escape  (SERE)  schools,  combat (SS20)  and  water  (SS32)  IAW  AFI  16-1301,  Survival,  Evasion,  Resistance,  and  Escape (SERE) Operations, and initial aircrew flight equipment training (during formal school) will establish the follow-on due dates of training (based on the date first completing the course) for recurring training requirements.

Initial training is called S-V80-A (CST), S-V88-AL Evasion Conduct After Capture  (ECAC) or S-V90-A Water Survival Training (WST) IAW AFI 16-1301 (see Paragraph 2.3.2).  This training is not accomplished at the FTU, but should be completed before member arrives at the gaining unit.  If the member arrives at the gaining unit without this training, it will be scheduled as soon as practical.   4.  Flight physicals become due the 366th day after the previous physical and expire after the 455th day or as indicated on the AF Form 1042, whichever occurs first.  The required frequency may vary to address waivers and/or individual physical limitations (as determined by the Flight Surgeon), but in no case will exceed 455 days IAW reference directives. 5.  IAW AFI 11-202V1, refer to reference publications which provide guidance for accomplishment of ancillary training requirements.   2.4.  Flying  Training  Requirements  .    Complete  flying  training  requirements  for  initial qualification IAW AFI 11-202V1 and this instruction. 2.5.  Conversion/Differences Qualification Training Requirements.  When possible, qualified Instructor aircrew members will provide the training to create an initial cadre.  In some instances, it will be necessary for units to form an initial cadre of crewmember personnel for whom specific training qualification requirements may be waived upon request.  The following conditions will apply to the management of initial cadre crewmember qualification: 2.5.1.  Tasked  MAJCOM,  in-coordination  with  lead  and  training  command,  will  develop  a training plan for unit conversions. 2.5.1.1.  The training plan should include provisions to form  a nucleus of crewmembers to include Instructor and flight examiners (initial cadre). 2.5.1.2.  Initial cadre will not be designated in a crew position higher than currently held, e.g. C-17 Mission Pilot (MP) to KC-135 Evaluator Pilot (EP), unless previously qualified in the conversion aircraft. 24 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 2.5.2.  Units  with  unique  aircraft  modification  (e.g.,  KC-135RT,  etc.)  or  missions  (e.g., SOAR,  Receiver  Air  Refueling,  etc.)  will  develop  and  maintain  in-unit  difference  training programs  for  assigned/attached  crewmembers,  if  not  available,  as  described  in  Paragraph 5.6.    Units  will  submit  these  training  programs  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM/CC  (or MAJCOM/A3 if appropriately delegated) for approval.  Use the appropriate ARMS events in Table 2.2 and include details in local supplement or OGI. (T-1). 2.5.2.1.  Difference  Certification.    Sq/CC  will  complete  crewmember  certification  when difference  training  is  complete  and  an  evaluation  is  not  required.    When  applicable, annotate “Q0XX Difference Certification” (see  Paragraph  1.8 and applicable events  in Chapter 7).  Away from home station, the assigned unit will complete an AF Form 1381 and the individual will hand-carry to their host unit. 2.5.3.  In-unit Difference Training.  Difference training assumes the student is qualified in the ‘X’C-135 (e.g., OC-135, RC-135, etc.).  A formal course may be appropriate (e.g., TX-3) or units  may  develop  a  Difference  Qualification  Training  (DQT)  program  based  on  available training resources (e.g., simulator, CBT, workbooks) and guide in Table 2.2.  MAJCOM/CC (or MAJCOM/A3 if appropriately delegated) staff is approval authority for DQT on case-by-case only. (T-1). 2.5.4.  Table 2.  2 is intended as a guide only; Unit Commanders will dictate actual training requirements on case-by-case basis in accordance with AFI 11-202V1. Table 2.2.

Crewmembers will attend a formal initial qualification course for dual  qualification  in  different  MDS  aircraft.    Crewmembers  maintaining  dual  qualification  in different  model  aircraft  will,  as  a  minimum,  maintain  FTL-A  currency  requirements  in  each aircraft (N/A for senior officers; see Paragraph 2.7). 2.6.1.  KC-135R,  and  T-model  aircraft  are  considered  the  same  MDS  and  do  not  meet multiple qualification criteria in AFI 11-202V1. 2.7.  Senior  Officer  Qualification  Requirements  .    AFI  11-202V1  identifies  senior  officer qualification requirements.  KC-135 R-model SOC is available on ETCA. 2.7.1.  After  qualification  IAW  AFI  11-202V1  and  with  OG/CC  approval,  senior  officers (assigned  or  attached)  may  seek  training  which  leads  to  a  higher  FTL  and/or  qualification.  The unit OSS/OST is responsible for determining training requirements based on the senior officer’s  flying  experience  and  familiarity  with  the  weapons  system.    MAJCOM/CC  (or MAJCOM/A3  if  appropriately  delegated)  will  approve  the  proposed  training  plan  prior  to execution. 2.7.2.  Senior  Officers  that  complete  full  qualification  training  requirements  will  maintain FTL-A continuation training requirements. 2.8.  Flight Surgeons  .  Flight Surgeons are allowed to fly locally as defined by OG/CC and log time  while  in  training  for  initial  (mission)  qualification.    See  AFI  11-202V1  for  training requirements. 2.9.  Requalification  Training  (RQT).  AFI  11-202V1  specifies  requalification  training  limits and  requirements.    An  aircrew  member  is  unqualified  upon  expiration  of  the  qualification evaluation, loss of currency exceeding 6 months (for currency items specified in Chapter 4), or completion  of  a  qualification  evaluation  in  a  different  MDS  (unless  multiple  qualification  has been approved prior to the evaluation), whichever occurs first.  The duration of unqualified time is  from  the date the aircrew member became unqualified until  the specific retraining start  date.  For ADSCs related to aircrew training, see AFI 36-2107.  For in-unit RQT using ATS support, see Paragraph 1.5.5. 2.9.1.  Individuals  requalifying  as  KC-135  crewmembers  will  complete  in-unit  or  formal school those  mission qualification/certification events from Tables 2.1,  3.1,  3.2,  4.1, and  4.2 that have expired or are overdue. (IAW  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1)  and  accomplish training 2.9.1.1.  A thorough review of the individual‘s flying training/history documentation will be  conducted  by  appropriate  training  authority  (Sq/DOT  for  in-unit  requalification,  or AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 27 FTU  if  formal  school  requalification)  and  items  to  be  accomplished  during  the requalification will be determined.  These items will be annotated on the AF 4024 in the individual‘s training folder and specified on the in-unit requalification letter if applicable. 2.9.2.  Former KC-135 Instructors may accomplish Instructor requalification concurrent with basic requalification (in-unit or formal course) for their crew position.  In all cases of loss of qualification  exceeding  39  months,  the  Sq/CC  will  determine  which  special  qualifications and certifications must be re-accomplished and training required to recertify.  If the gaining squadron  commander  determines  that  the  individual  requires  additional  seasoning  prior  to performing Instructor duties, an individual can be certified as an aircraft commander (Pilots) or  basic  qualification  (Boom  Operators)  until  the  squadron  commander  determines  the individual is ready to be certified as an Instructor. 2.9.3.  Requalification  Training  Courses.    Unqualified  crew  members  will  complete  the appropriate TX-1, TX-2, TX-3 (longest to shortest) courses outlined below. 2.9.3.1.  Unqualified for up to 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or up to 51 months at the end of any active (or current) flying assignment may accomplish an in-unit  training  program  (see  Paragraph  5.4)  or  TX-3  course.    A  flight  evaluation  is required  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and  AFI  11-2KC-135V2,  KC-135  Aircrew  Evaluation Criteria.    Crewmembers  may  simultaneously  requalify  as  an  Instructor  during  in-unit training  with  an  approved  waiver.    Crewmembers  may  simultaneously  requalify  as  an Instructor while attending TX-3 course if the gaining unit’s Sq/CC submits the request to the  97  TRS  prior  to  the  training  start  date.    The  FTU  may  decide  not  to  qualify  the individual to Instructor status based on performance or resources. 2.9.3.2.  Unqualified 39 or more months at the end of a non-flying assignment, or 51 or more months at the end of any active (or current) flying assignment, up to 8 years, will complete  TX-2  course  and  a  flight  evaluation  IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and  AFI  11-2KC-135V2.    Crewmembers  may  simultaneously  requalify  as  an  Instructor  while  attending TX-2 course with approved waiver. 2.9.3.3.  Unqualified for over 8  years will complete TX-1 course and a flight evaluation IAW  AFI  11-202V2  and  AFI  11-2KC-135V2.    Crewmembers  may  not  simultaneously requalify as Instructor. 2.9.4.  Units  conducting  simultaneous  requalification  and  Instructor  training  must  compare the  formal  requalification  course  syllabus  and  Instructor  course  syllabus  to  develop  an individual  training  plan.    The  plan  must  include  all  phases  of  training  and  an  appropriate (suitable)  substitute  (e.g.  CBT,  Instructor  Based  Training  (IBT),  simulators,  number  of flights, etc.). 2.9.4.1.  See AFI 11-2KC-135V2 for simultaneous Instructor re-qualification training and evaluation requirements. 2.10.  Navigator/CSO Training.  Navigator/CSO training includes three training phases: 2.10.1.  Basic Navigator/CSO.  KC-135 unit level staff Navigator/CSO who may perform in-flight duties not including rendezvous (RV).  These basic Navigator/CSO duties are limited to system operation, communication, and crew coordination.  Units may also maintain a local training  program  for  initial  and  requalification  training  that  focus  on  FMS-3  (B-Kit) 28 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 operations, checklist procedures, CRM and communication training.  The maximum level of qualification is BMC (FTL-C or FTL-E).  See ground and continuation training requirements in Chapter 4. 2.10.1.1.  Basic Navigator/CSOs may fly any sortie with  an FMS-3 suite installed.  The BMC  basic  Navigator/CSO  may  fly  without  an  Instructor  once  qualified.    A  BMC Navigator/CSO  may  deploy  and  fly  as  a  staff  Navigator/CSO  (mission  planning  cell, scheduler, etc.).  When used, basic Navigator/CSO will complete requirements in Table 3.1  and  Table  3.2.    BMC  basic  Navigator/CSOs  will  comply  with  Theater  Deployment Requirements (e.g., Concept of Operations (CONOPS), etc.). 2.10.1.2.  Basic Navigator/CSOs non-current (FTL-E) may fly with an IN or IP to regain their currency (M010) with a FMS-3 Navigator/CSO Suite installed. 2.10.2.  SOAR  Navigator/CSO.    KC-135  Navigator/CSOs  complement  designated  SOAR units as additional crewmember.  SOAR Navigator/CSO training is conducted in-unit by 22 OSS/OST,  McConnell  AFB.    SOAR  Navigator/CSOs  will  be  basic-qualified  and  will maintain  MR  status  for  the  SOAR  mission  (USAFWS  SOAR  Navigator/CSOs  may maintain/regain SOAR currency utilizing qualified USAFWS SOAR Instructor Pilots).  See ground and continuation training requirements in Chapter 4. 2.10.2.1.  SOAR Navigator/CSOs may fly any sortie with an FMS-3 suite installed. 2.10.2.2.  SOAR  Navigator/CSOs  non-current  in  SOAR  RV  (S036)  must  fly  with  a current SOAR  Instructor (IN or IP) to regain  currency.  Non-SOAR sorties may still be accomplished while non-current in only S036. 2.10.3.  Instructor  Navigator/CSO.    See  Table  5.2  for  minimum  flying  time  requirements.  When  selected  for  upgrade,  complete  course  prerequisites  (see  Paragraph  5.4.2.2).    The CBT  or  web-based  lessons  (and  testing)  are  a  baseline  program  followed  by  completion  of the appropriate in-unit developed Instructor training and evaluation. AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 29 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  Description.  This  chapter  establishes  minimum  criteria  and  training  requirements  for conventional  and/or  OPLAN-801X  MCT.    Except  where  specifically  stated,  units  conducting initial/requalification  training  and  MCT  may  arrange  mission  sequence  or  sequence  training events as necessary to use flying training hours effectively.  Crewmembers that have graduated from  a  formal  training  course  noted  in  Table  6.1  or  an  AMC/A3T  approved,  in-unit initial/requalification training program, with a valid Form 8 are considered Mission Qualified but not Mission Certified or Mission Ready until the appropriate MCT program has been completed as applicable.  Crewmembers will be MR before entry in special mission certification or upgrade training  unless  noted  in  Table  3.1,  Table  3.2,  and  Table  3.3  or  unless  the  mission  training  is specifically  directed  as  pre-MCT  (i.e.,  SOAR  and  ARR  certification).    Special  mission certifications run concurrent with MCT will not delay MCT completion.  Crewmembers in MCT may participate in exercises. 3.1.1.  Conventional  certification  must  be  completed  prior  to  crewmembers  deploying.    If operational  requirements  exist,  conventional  certification  and  OPLAN-801X  certification may be conducted separately.  If OPLAN-801X certification is not conducted in conjunction with conventional certification, the crewmember will complete OPLAN-801X certification as soon as conditions permit (return from Temporary Duty (TDY), obtain appropriate clearance, etc.) 3.1.2.  MCT is not required for BMC crewmembers assigned to MAJCOMs, Numbered Air Force  (NAF)s,  AOCs,  USAFECs,  Contingency  Response  Wing  (CRW)s,  Contingency Response Group (CRG)s, FTU, USAFWS, Direct Reporting Unit (DRU)s or SOC graduates not on aircrew mobility status unless specified in course syllabus, MAJCOM Supplement or specified in this AFI. 3.2.

Description.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  flying  and  related  ground  training requirements to maintain currency.  The unit commander will ensure each crewmember receives sufficient continuation training to maintain individual proficiency. 4.2.  Aircrew Status.  KC-135 crewmembers are assigned to the following status: 4.2.1.  Mission  Ready  (MR).    For  SORTS,  operational  tasking,  and  deployments  a  MR crewmember is defined as one who is available and qualified in the squadron’s mission (will have  completed  mission  qualification  and  mission  certification  training  for  the  applicable crew position in this AFI). 4.2.2.  Non-Mission  Ready  (NMR).    A  crewmember  that  is  unqualified,  non-current  or incomplete in required continuation training, not qualified, or not certified to perform the unit mission.  See Paragraph 4.9 for specific guidance on crewmembers that are non-current or incomplete in continuation training.  NMR crewmembers cannot deploy. 4.2.3.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC).    A  NMR  crewmember  assigned  to  MAJCOM headquarters,  NAF,  618  AOC  (TACC),  USAFEC,  CRW,  CRG,  FTU,  USAFWS,  or  DRU, who  has  satisfactorily  completed  MQT,  does  not  maintain  MR  status,  but  maintains familiarization  in  the  command’s  or  unit’s  operational  mission.    Basic  (non-SOAR) Navigator/CSOs should be assigned BMC. 4.2.3.1.  The crewmember may maintain qualification in some aspects of the unit mission and should be able to attain full qualification in the unit mission within 30 days. 4.2.3.2.  Formal School (AETC) and USAFWS crewmembers are qualified to conduct all aspects of their respective training mission in accordance to their training syllabi.  AETC and  USAFWS  Instructors  must  be  qualified  in  the  training/unit  mission  before performing  Instructor  duties.    AETC  and  USAFWS  crewmembers  may  fly  CONUS, Alaska,  Hawaii,  and  Caribbean  618  AOC  (TACC)-directed  missions,  but  will  comply with MR requirements to fly all other 618 AOC (TACC)-directed missions.  Current and qualified formal  school  Instructors maintain MR  status  if they  complete the appropriate events in Table 4.3, Table 4.4, and Table 4.5 (unless exempted by note). 4.2.3.3.  BMC crewmembers may log  Instructor or Evaluator time for the portion of the mission for which they are current and qualified and performing  Instructor or Evaluator duties. 4.2.4.  Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ).  A crewmember that has satisfactorily completed initial qualification training and is qualified to perform aircrew duties in the aircraft. 4.2.5.  MR,  BMC,  and  BAQ  crewmembers  must  accomplish  and/or  maintain the requirements in AFI 11-202V1 (for their respective status) and the appropriate events in the ground and semi-annual flying continuation tables in this chapter. 4.3.  Flying Training Levels. 36 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 4.3.1.  Sq/CC  will  assign  FTLs  to  assigned  (and  attached)  crewmembers  (see  Paragraph 1.4.6).    Establish  FTL  assignments  on  experience  and  aircraft  proficiency.    NMR crewmembers assigned to MAJCOM staff, NAF, 618 AOC (TACC), USAFEC, CRW, CRG, formal school, USAFWS, or DRU, are normally categorized as BMC and assigned FTL-A or -E.  Basic (non-SOAR) Navigator/CSOs are assigned FTL-C or -E. 4.3.1.1.  FTL-A  Highly Experienced Crewmembers.  (As a guide, crewmembers having 10  or  more  years  of  operational  flying  experience)    This  may  include  MR  or  NMR MAJCOM  headquarters  staff  and  618  AOC  (TACC)  personnel;  formal  schoolhouse Instructors;  NAF  personnel;  USAFEC  Instructors,  Wg/CC,  OG/CC,  and  Sq/CC, Operations Officers, crewmembers assigned to  OG evaluation  positions, and  Instructors assigned  primarily  to  staff  duties.    NOTE:    NMR  MAJCOM  staff  and/or  NAF Instructor/flight  Evaluators  may  fly  unsupervised  when  maintaining  FTL-A  and applicable  ground  training  in  Table  4.1.    BMC  MAJCOM  Instructors  or  Evaluators assigned  overseas  or  in  the  CONUS  may  fly  unsupervised  on  routine,  non-contingency sorties in  their respective theaters.   Lead Command Evaluators may fly  unsupervised in any theater when maintaining FTL-A and applicable training in Table 4.1 and  4.2. 4.3.1.2.  FTL-B    Experienced,  MR  Crewmember.    (As  a  guide,  crewmembers  having between 5-10 years of operational flying experience). 4.3.1.3.  FTL-C  MR Crewmember or BAQ Crewmember pursuing MR status after initial qualification training.  (As a guide, crewmembers having less than 5 years of operational flying experience)  Initially assign inexperienced MR crewmembers to FTL-C. 4.3.1.4.  FTL-D  No longer used. 4.3.1.5.  FTL-E  —  BAQ  or  BMC  non-Instructor  staff.    May  include  senior  officers, MAJCOM,  NAF,  618  AOC  (TACC)  staff,  and  attached  flyers  that  are  not  maintaining MR  or  Instructor  status.    FTL-E  requirements  are  insufficient  for  MR  status  and crewmembers assigned to FTL-E will fly with an Instructor of like specialty at all times (see Paragraph 1.10.4).  BMC Basic Navigator/CSOs see Paragraph 2.10.1. 4.3.2.  Change of FTL.  Once the semi-annual period begins, do not move a crewmember to a level  requiring  fewer  events.    Exception:  Units  associating  FTLs  with  crew  positions  may change  FTLs  after  upgrade  is  complete  (i.e.,  Instructor  upgrade).    BAQ  crewmembers  may be  placed  into  a  different  FTL  any  time  after  attaining  MR  status.    Prorate  events  upon changing training levels (see Paragraph 4.8). 4.4.  Training Events/Tables.  ARMS training event identifiers and event descriptions are listed in Chapter 7.  The unit may designate Unit Defined Events (UDE) as a “X” event (i.e., X020) and will include local “X” event identifiers in OG/CC level guidance (see Paragraph 7.22). 4.4.1.  Crediting  Event  Accomplishment.    Credit  required  events  accomplished  on  training missions,  operational  missions,  and  satisfactory  qualification  evaluations  toward  the crewmembers  currency  and  continuation   Event  completion establishes a subsequent due date (see Paragraph 4.8 for event proration).  Use date of last satisfactory evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all flying training currency events that  were  trained  during  an  ATS  formal  course  (see  Table  6.1).    All  Crewmembers  may credit  G220,  G230,  G240  G26X  currencies  upon  successful  completion  of  an  ATS  formal course syllabus or if accomplished during in-unit requalification IAW Paragraph 1.5.5 (use training  requirements. AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 37 the evaluation date as the date of accomplishment).  Training requirements for these events will not apply until the next Annual period (Pilots will still be required to accomplish G26X events for the next semi-annual period for currency). 4.4.1.1.  Credit  all  AC  Upgrade,  and  Instructor  course  (formal  or  in-unit)  training  event accomplishments  toward  continuation  training  (currency  and  semi-annual)  requirements for  the  crew  position  in  which  the  individual  is  currently  qualifying,  including  pre-  (or post) Pilot Instructor course training and Boom Operator CRM requirements. 4.4.2.  For  an  unsatisfactory  flight  evaluation,  do  not  log  continuation  training  events  items graded Q-3 (according to AFI 11-2KC-135V2) until re-qualified. 4.4.3.  Make-up  training  (ground  or  flying)  is  creditable  towards  the  new  training  period.  Exception:  If unqualified in an event(s), only credit the event if successfully accomplished in an official requalification program or on a successful evaluation IAW  4.4.1. 4.4.4.  Instructor training requirements and responsibilities.  Instructors and Flight Examiners may  credit  50  percent  of  their  total  continuation  training  requirements  per  event  while instructing  or  evaluating  when  the  events  requirement  is  2  or  more.    Exception:  Instructor and Flight Examiner Pilots may not credit takeoff or landings flown by another Pilot. 4.4.5.  ARMS.  Record all training events in ARMS (with the appropriate exemptions, notes, and adjustment in the course descriptions). 4.4.5.1.  Training  events  conducted  during  block  training  or  phase  training  may  be consolidated under one ARMS entry. 4.4.5.2.  Use one ARMS entry for combined training events. 4.4.5.3.  Input all one-time events and  events  required for Permanent  Change of Station (PCS) in the ARMS database. 4.4.5.4.  Flying  events  accomplished  in  the  simulator  (OFT  or  BOWST/BOSS)  as allowed  in  Table  4.3,  Table  4.4,  and  Table  4.5  will  be  coded  with  an  “S”  prefix  in ARMS.  All simulator accomplishments must be documented and tracked in ARMS. 4.5.  Continuation Training Requirements. 4.5.1.  Completion and tracking of continuation training is the responsibility of the individual crewmember.  Crewmembers shall actively work with unit schedulers and training offices to ensure their continuation training is accomplished as described in this chapter. 4.5.2.  Ground Training Events.  Crewmembers will comply with requirements of Table 4.1 and Table 4.2. 4.5.2.1.  Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to NMR status.  See Paragraph 4.9 for regaining mission ready status. 4.5.2.2.  Failure to complete mobility training in Table 4.2 does not lead to NMR status, but may restrict member from certain missions. 4.5.2.3.  Attached Crewmembers (i.e., NAF, MAJCOM, USAFEC, etc.) may accomplish ground training events at locations other than their unit of attachment.  The crewmember is  responsible  for  reporting  accomplished  training  events  to  their  unit  of  attachment (ARMS office). 38 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 4.5.2.4.  Crewmembers performing alert duty may  accomplish  ground training that does not  degrade  required  response  time  or  mission  accomplishment.    Specify  requirements and or restriction in MAJCOM supplement and local supplement or OGI. Table 4.1.  Aircrew Ground Continuation Training Requirements (Failure to Accomplish = NMR).

Failure to accomplish events may restrict a crewmembers ability to participate in missions that require the event (i.e., contingency missions).  (T-3).  4.5.3.  Flying  Continuation  Training  Requirements.  Use  Table  4.3,    4.4,  and    4.5.  Each training event is accompanied by a required volume and/or a required currency. The currency requirement  only  applies  if  there  is  an  associated  volume.  For  example,  one  F030  (Large Formation) is required per year for FTL A, B, and C. The annual currency does not apply to FTL-E because there is no volume required. See Chapter 7 for event descriptions. 4.5.3.1.  ATD Credit for Training Requirements.  Flight events creditable in the ATD are listed  in  Table  4.3,  Table  4.4  and  Table  4.5  (see  Paragraph  4.4.5.4  for  ARMS tracking). AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 41 4.5.3.1.1.  ATS  contract  Instructor’s  supervision  meets the  requirements  for continuation training (currency and semi-annual) events requiring Instructor or direct Instructor supervision.  Exception: M010 requires supervision from USAF Instructor of like specialty. 4.5.3.2.  As  a  minimum,  SOC  and  all  other  crewmembers  maintaining  BMC  or  BAQ status  in  the  KC-135  will  maintain  FTL-E.    Senior  officers  on  MR  status  will  comply with  Table  4.3  and  Table  4.4.    This  requirement  also  applies  to  additional  aircraft  in which a senior officer may be qualified (see multiple qualifications).  Attached aviators may  conduct  flight  training  at  other  locations;  however,  interfly  agreements  and  other documentation (i.e.…ITS, AF Form 1042, and other Go/No-Go documentation) may be required.  See AFI 11-401 and AFI 11-2KC-135V3 for passenger carrying restrictions. 4.5.3.3.  Each  MAJCOM  provides  flying-hours  to  each  wing  as  training,  test,  and  ferry hours  or  organizational  and  maintenance  (O  &  M)  hours.    Al780902  flying  hours  are based on FTL-C, and are designed to provide all crew positions with sufficient hours to accomplish  all  continuation  flying  training  requirements  with  percentage  of  completion aboard flight simulators. 4.5.3.4.  Mission  Oriented,  Proficiency,  and  Phase  simulator  profiles  (G240,  G250,  and G261-G264) will be flown in the same manner as the aircraft, to include the wear and use of professional gear (headsets, gloves, etc.). 4.5.3.4.1.  Simulator  profiles  will  be  scheduled  as  ground  events  in  the  primary scheduling  program  (GDSS  II,  GTIMS,  PEX,  etc.)  and  event  cancellation  authority will reside with the OG/CC (or designated representative). 4.5.3.4.2.  Simulator  training  pre-requisites  (i.e.,  profile  courseware/workbook,  etc.) must be completed prior to the simulator start time or the training will be cancelled.  Exception:  ARC  members  should  accomplish  pre-requisites  prior to  Phase simulators,  but  the  event  will  not  be  cancelled  if  required  pre-requisites  are  not accomplished. 4.6.

OG/CC may authorize 90-Day currency extension/pro-ration for night events to compensate for climatic adjustments (long-daylight periods in summer) for the period 1 April through 30 September for units north of the 60th North Parallel. (T-3).   4.7.  Ancillary  Training.  Ancillary  Training  is  guidance  or  instruction  that  contributes  to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series.  AFI 11-2KC-135V1 is not the governing directive for completion of ancillary training events.  IAW AFI  11-202V1  and  AFI  36-2201,  the  source  AFIs,  provide  training  frequency  for  these  events unless an approved waiver has been authorized.  See UDM representative to ensure compliance with  additional  USAF  personnel  training  requirements.    Some  USAF  ancillary  training requirements  may  be  accessed  and  tracked  via  the  Advanced  Distributed  Learning  Service (ADLS).  UDMs have access to ADLS training records. 4.8.  Proration  of  Training.  AFI  11-202V1  describes  proration  of  training  requirements  for crewmembers  not  available  for  flying  duties.    In  addition,  prorate  training  for  non-availability due to contingency alerts and contingency flying TDYs when contingency precludes training for certain  mission  events  (PACAF  and  USAFE:  also  contingency  operations  from  home  station).  This  authority  must  be  used  judiciously,  especially  when  prorating  the  same  crewmember  for consecutive semi-annual training periods. 4.8.1.  Use  this  formula  to  determine  training  requirements:  Number  of  Months  Available times the Event Volume divided by Number of Months in the Training Period.  Round down to nearest whole number (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5), but not less than 1 unless the individual was available for less than 15 days total during the Semi-Annual (SA) period.  ARMS is unable to round down so manual calculation or a higher proration is required. AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 47 4.8.1.1.  Use  Table  4.6  to  determine  the  number  of  months  available.    Prorate  only  if absence  is  at  least  15-cumulative  days.    Combining  non-consecutive  periods  of contingency alert is allowed for proration purposes. 4.8.1.2.  When  an  individual  permanently  changes  station  during  the  training  cycle  to  a unit  flying  the  same  model  aircraft  and  enters  the  same  FTL  or  lower,  credit  training accomplished  at  the  previous  base.    Prorate  training  requirements  based  on  the  time available  (e.g.,  time  at  former  base,  plus  time  at  new  base,  minus  number  of  days  not available) during the training period.  Time available starts 45 days after sign-in or on the date of actual accomplishment of the first training event, whichever occurs first.  Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements. 4.8.1.3.  OSS/OST or Sq/DOT (as applicable) will maintain training proration letter for a period  of  two  years  (commanders  may  increase  this  frequency  as  required).    Non-collocated  squadrons  and  detachments  will  forward  proration  letter  to  the  unit  for inclusion in the unit’s records. 4.8.2.  Units may also prorate requirements for individuals changing training levels. Table 4.6.  Individual Availability.

Declare individuals NMR if they 1) fail to complete ground continuation training requirements from Table 4.1,  4.2) fail to complete semi-annual flying continuation training requirements from Tables 4.3,  4.4 and  4.5) fail to maintain flying currencies from Tables 4.3,  4.4 and  4.5; the following guidance applies: 4.9.1.  Failure to Complete Ground Training Events. 4.9.1.1.  Failure  to  Complete.    Individuals  who  fail  to  complete  ground  training requirements  are  declared  NMR.    The  crewmember  cannot  deploy  until  training  is accomplished  (Exception:    Non-current  crewmembers  may  fly  unsupervised  on  local, routine, and CONUS missions according to Table 4.1 on sorties not requiring the ground training  event).    Crewmembers  NMR  in  OPLAN-801X  ground  training  events  (G030, G040,  G041B  or  Q010)  remain  MR-conventional.    Units  will  attempt  to  return  NMR OPLAN-801X crewmembers to MR status as soon as practical. 4.9.1.1.1.  An  individual  NMR  for  failure  to  complete  Hazardous  Cargo  Training (G182)  may  fly  unsupervised  on  local  training  missions  only  with  Sq/CC  approval until training is completed. 4.9.1.2.  Waivers  for  Ground  Training  Events.    The  OG/CC  or  equivalent  may  waive ground  continuation  training  events  identified  in  Table  4.1  and  Table  4.2  according  to 48 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 Paragraph  1.5.7.    The  decision  to  grant  a  waiver  will  be  based  on  the  individual crewmember’s  experience  and  proficiency  level;  waivers  will  not  be  based  on  a crewmember’s availability.  The OG/CC will determine the allowable time period of the waiver.  The make-up training should be accomplished at the earliest opportunity.  This waiver  is  for  unforeseen  circumstances  only  and  only  for  events  that  will  not  degrade mission accomplishment. (T-3). 4.9.2.  Failure to Complete Semi-Annual Flying Training Events. 4.9.2.1.  Failure  to  Complete.    Individuals  who  fail  to  complete  flying  training requirements are declared NMR.  The Sq/CC will review ARMS products at the end of each  semi-annual  training  period.    For  individuals  who  fail  to  accomplish  training requirements,  the  Sq/CC  will  place  individuals  in  supervised  training  status  for  the event(s) and declare them NMR in those unit missions requiring the event(s) 4.9.2.1.1.  Pilots non-current in Data Link  (M007) still maintain MR status, may fly in a non-Data Link mode, and may still deploy OCONUS. 4.9.2.1.2.  If  a  Pilot  or  Navigator/CSO  is  delinquent  in  M007,  the  crewmember  will accomplish  refresher  data  link  CBTs,  review  aircraft  normal/abnormal  data  link operations/procedures, and review appropriate data link courseware. 4.9.2.1.3.  Notify the MAJCOM/SG when Flight Surgeons fail to meet semi-annual or annual  sortie  requirements  (IAW  AFI  11-202V1).    MAJCOMs  establish  procedures to  assess  continued  active  flying  authorization.    Place  a  copy  of  the  MAJCOM/SG notification in the members’ flight training folder. 4.9.2.2.  Waivers  for  Flying  Training  Events.    The  OG/CC  or  equivalent  may  waive flying continuation/currency training events identified in Table 4.3, Table 4.4 and Table 4.5  according  to  Paragraph  1.5.7.    Base  the  decision  to  approve  a  waiver  on  the individual  crewmember’s  experience  and  proficiency  level.    Do  not  approve  a  waiver request  for  the  same  flying  training  event  deficiency  affecting  consecutive  training periods  (if  a  waiver  is  desired  for  consecutive  training  periods,  forward  request  for MAJCOM approval). (T-3). 4.9.2.3.  If  OG/CC  waiver  is  not  accomplished,  place  individuals  who  have  failed  to complete  semi-annual  flying  training  events  in  supervised  status  for  the  event(s)  until Sq/CC  directed  re-training  is  accomplished.    An  AF  Form  4022,  Aircrew  Training Folder, is not required; training may be documented on the NMR letter. 4.9.3.  Flight Training Currency.  Flight currency is associated with those events denoted in the  flying  continuation  training  tables  (Table  4.3,  Table  4.4,  or  Table  4.5)  by  a  specific period  of  time  (i.e.,  Monthly,  Quarterly,  Semi-Annually,  Annually,  etc.)  within  which  the event must be accomplished.  The required currency may be listed in the “CUR” column (in which case, it applies to all FTLs unless the cell is grayed out) or in the appropriate “FTL” column.  A currency event must be accomplished at least once within that specified time in order to maintain the currency. 4.9.3.1.  Loss  of  Currency.  Place  individuals  that  are  non-current  in  one  or  more currency  events  in  supervised  training  status  for  that  event  and  declare  them  NMR  in those  unit  missions  requiring  that  event.    Crewmembers  are  “non-current”  the  day  after AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 49 event currency expires (i.e., a crewmember who accomplished a monthly currency event on  5  September,  becomes  non-current  on  1  November).    Crewmembers  non-current  for events identified by Note in Table 4.3, Table 4.4, or Table 4.5 for greater than 6 months risk loss of qualification. 4.9.3.1.1.  A Pilot non-current in Takeoff (P020, P040), Approaches (P070), Landings (P170, P180, P190), or Landing, Night (unaided) (P192) will not fly unsupervised on any sortie. 4.9.3.1.2.  Pilots non-current in N010 Tanker RV do not require direct IP supervision. 4.9.3.1.3.  A Navigator/CSO who is non-current may be supervised by an IP and may regain currency by the same IP. 4.9.3.1.4.  A  Boom  Operator  non-current  in  M051  MPRS  Sortie  may  continue  to participate  unsupervised  in  all  missions  not  requiring  MPRS  operations.    Boom Operators  may  deploy,  but  not  as  a  MPRS  certified  crewmember  until  currency  is regained with a MPRS certified IBO. 4.9.3.2.  Flight  Surgeon  loss  of  flying  currency.    Flight  Surgeons  that  exceed  60  days between  sorties  require  a  review  of  aircraft  exits  and  oxygen  systems  conducted  by  a member  of  the  flight  crew  designated  by  the  AC  prior  to  the  flight  to  regain  flying currency. 4.9.3.2.1.  The egress review will be signed off by the AC on a copy of the AMC/SGP memo  or  other  approved  form  (e.g.,  AF  Form  1522, locally  generated form/memo/etc.).  Note: Documentation on AFTO 781 is not acceptable.  The Flight Surgeon  must  submit  this  documentation  to  the  local  Squadron/Host  Aviation Resource  Manager  (SARM/HARM)  office  after  the  flight  or  upon  return  to  home station if the flight is in conjunction with a TDY.  The HARM or SARM will place the documentation in the Flight Surgeon‘s training folder. 4.9.3.2.2.  Failure  to  complete  and  document  required  training  before  the  flight  will result in the loss of ability to log primary Flight Surgeon time. 4.9.3.3.  The  crewmember  cannot  deploy  until  currency  is  regained  (see  Paragraph 1.10.3.1). 4.9.3.4.  Aircrew  members  will  not  log  events  in  an  OFT  or  BOWST/BOSS,  as appropriate,  for  which  they  are  non-current  until  demonstrating  proficiency  (regaining currency) under the supervision of an qualified Instructor of like specialty. 4.9.3.5.  Aircrew  members  will  not  log  events  for  which  they  are  non-current  until currency is regained. 4.9.4.  Regaining Currency or Mission-Ready Status. 4.9.4.1.  Loss  of  Currency  or  NMR  for  up  to  6-Months.    Crewmembers  maintain  their current training level and no training folder is required.  Crewmember must demonstrate proficiency  in  the  aircraft  or  simulator  (as  appropriate)  in  all  delinquent  items  while under  supervision  of  an  Air  Force  Instructor  (or  ATS  contract  Instructor  when  Tables 4.3,  4.4 or  4.5 permits regaining currency in the ATD). 50 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 4.9.4.2.  Loss  of  Currency  or  NMR  exceeding  6-Months.    Crewmember  is  declared Unqualified for a loss of currency for events in Table 4.3, Table 4.4, and Table 4.5 with Note  1.    The  crewmember  will  complete  Sq/CC  directed  requalification  training  and evaluation  according  to  AFI  11-2KC-135  Volume  2.    For  all  other  currency  events, regain currency by demonstrating proficiency in the aircraft or ATD to the satisfaction of an Air Force  Instructor (or ATS contract  Instructor when Tables 4.3, 4.4  or 4.5 permits regaining  currency  in  the  ATD)  in  all  delinquent  items.    Unqualified  crewmembers cannot  log  flight  training  events  (except  if  successfully  accomplished  in  an  official requalification program or on a successful evaluation IAW Paragraph 4.4.1 and  4.4.3.). 4.9.4.2.1.  Boom Operators non-current in M051 MPRS Sortie in excess of 6 months will not be considered unqualified but will require re-accomplishment of A006 MPRS Ground Training prior to attempting flight requirements that re-establish currency. 4.9.4.2.2.  Flight  Surgeons  that  exceed  6-months  between  sorties  require  completion of  LL03,  Emergency  Egress  Training,  Non-Ejection  Seat,  with  a  certified  aircrew instructor prior to the next flight. 4.9.4.2.2.1.  Notify  the  MAJCOM/SG  when  Flight  Surgeons  fail  to  meet  semi-annual  or annual  sortie requirements.  MAJCOMs establish procedures to  assess continued  active  flying  authorization.    Place  a  copy  of  the  MAJCOM/SG notification in the members’ flight training folder. 4.9.5.  OSS/OST  or  Sq/DOT  (as  applicable)  will  maintain  NMR  and  Waiver  records  for  a minimum of two years.  Non-collocated squadrons and detachments will forward NMR and Waiver records to the parent unit for inclusion in the parent units’ records. 4.10.  Requirements  Before  PCS  Or  TDY  By  Members  On  Active  Flying  Status.  AFI  11-202V1 specifies requirements before PCS or TDY. 4.11.  Requirements  Before  Removal  From  Active  Flying  Status.  AFI  11-202V1  specifies requirements before removal from active flying. 4.12.  Requirements  While  In  Inactive  Flying  Status.  AFI  11-202V1  specifies  requirements while in inactive flying status. 4.13.  Retraining  .  AFI 11-202V1 specifies retraining restriction before separation, retirement, or mandatory inactive flying status. 4.14.  Aircrews  Flying  in  Non-US  Air  Force  Aircraft  and  with  Non-US  Air  Force Units.  AFI 11-401 addresses individuals flying in this status. 4.15.  Training Period.

Description  .    This  chapter  identifies  general  prerequisites  and  training  requirements  for upgrade. 5.1.1.  OG/CC  is  designated  waiver  authority  for  minimum  prerequisites  for  entry  into upgrade programs (this includes all Table 5.1 flying hour requirements). (T-3). Table 5.1.  Pilot Prerequisites For Upgrade--Selection Matrix. From UP To MP Prerequisite for Prerequisite Before R&C Course Entry Board Certification Notes Previous AC in 100 KC-135 hours (PAA) & (Various (via TX-1 or TX-USAF MDS and/or MPD Phase II guide, if 1,2,3,4 MDS) FP 2) MP (via Aircraft Commander 1000 hours TFT required 1000 hours TFT / 400 KC-135 hours (PAA) and MPD  MPD Phase I, II, & III 1,2,3 Upgrade (ACU)) Phase I & II MP (AC) IP IP EP 200 hours in  KC-135 (PAA) after R&C to AC Sq/CC recommendation   1,3  NOTES: 1.  Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft as a military Pilot including SUPT “student” and “other” time (TFT does not include time in another aircrew specialty or RPA time).  Simulator time is creditable to meet TFT requirement. 2.  100 KC-135 hours Primary Aircraft Authorization (PAA) required before R&C to perform AC duties. 3. KC-135 simulator time is creditable towards PAA Time.  Simulator time is creditable towards total flying hours. 4.  For MAF crossflow with similar skill set (i.e., C-17, C-5, etc.), use TX-2; MPD Phase II guide is not required.  Pilots with dissimilar background (i.e., OSA/FAIP, F-16, etc.), use TX-1; accomplish MPD Phase II guide in-unit.  5.2.  Mobility  Pilot  Development  (MPD).  Mobility  Pilot  Development  is  the  development program  leading  to  Aircraft  Commander  certification.    The  MPD  program  flows  from  Pilot Initial  Qualification  (PIQ)  or  Aircraft  Commander  Initial  Qualification  (TX-1  or  TX-2)  formal training  courses  through  continuation  training  to  upgrade  selection  and  culminates  in certification as an Aircraft Commander.  MPD continuation training is divided into three phases: MPD Phase I (V280), MPD Phase II (V281), and MPD Phase III.  All MPD Pilots will be dual-52 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 seat qualified and maintain qualification requirements according to  AFI 11-2KC-135V2.  MPD Pilots are not Aircraft Commanders.  See minimum flying hour requirements in Table 5.1. 5.2.1.  The  success  of  this  program  depends  on  MPD  Pilots  being  mentored  and  provided with  development  opportunities.    The  upgrade  training  timeline  to  Aircraft  Commander  is based  on  performance  and  at  the  discretion  of  the  Sq/CC,  should  be  tailored  to  match  an individual’s capabilities and experience level. 5.3.  MPD  Continuation Training thru Aircraft Commander Upgrade. 5.3.1.  Documentation.  Completion  of  MPD  Phase  I  and  II  is  documented  in  ARMS  as V280  and  V281  respectively;  GRACC  is  documented  in  ARMS  as  V282.    Document  the completion of the entire course via AF Form 1381 and Sq/CC certification. 5.3.2.  Training  Guides.  MPD  Phase  I  &  II  guides  are  available  for  download  on  the AMC/A3T  SharePoint®  (see  Paragraph  1.15).    Guides  should  be  carried  on  all  sorties  to maximize training opportunities. 5.3.3.  MPD  Phase  I  (V280).  After  completion  of  the  PIQ  course,  Pilots  enter  Phase  I  of continuation training.  This first phase consists of completing the MPD Phase I guide, which focuses  on  core  aircraft  abilities  including  communication,  checklist  discipline,  systems knowledge,  and  basic  mission  planning.    A  Phase  I  MPD  should  not  have  additional squadron duties nor be expected to  act as  an Aircraft Commander,  yet  they  should observe and learn from their aircrew leadership. 5.3.3.1.  During this stage of Pilot development, a Phase I MPD Pilot (FPC) is restricted to the right seat and may only occupy the aircraft left seat with an IP.  FPCs will train in the right seat during Mission Oriented Simulator Training (MOST) and Phase Sims and may occupy the left or right seats for Proficiency Sims (and available proficiency time at the  end  of  a  MOST  or  Phase  Sims).    FPCs  will complete  the  MPD  Phase  I  guide  NLT 180 days (365 days for ARC) after becoming mission ready. 5.3.3.2.  In order to advance beyond Phase I, the FPCs must be at least 6 months from the training start date (as defined in Paragraph 1.7.1), have a minimum of 200 PAA hours, and have completed the MPD Phase I guide.  Once these requirements are met, the FPCs may  be  approved  for  Phase  II  via  the  STRP.    For  FAIP/OSA  or  non-mobility  weapon system Pilots transitioning to MAF aircraft, completion of V280 is not required; however, V281 and V282 are required. 5.3.4.  MPD Phase II (V281)  .  This phase consists of completing the MPD Phase II guide, which  focuses  on  the  core  tasks  of  flying  skills,  mission  situational  awareness,  and  crew management required for Aircraft Commander certification. 5.3.4.1.  Training in this stage will ensure a balanced exposure to both left and right seats in  the  aircraft  with  an  AC  or  above.    Good  judgment  and  Risk  Management  (RM)  will dictate with whom they fly and what seat they occupy.  As Phase II MPD Pilots (FPQs) advance in knowledge, they are encouraged to practice actual mission management skills and decision making under the guidance of their AC or IP. 5.3.4.2.  MPD  Selection  for  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade/Certification.  Phase  II MPD Pilots must meet pre-requisites defined in Table 5.1 as well as complete the MPD Phase  II  guide.    Based  upon  performance,  experience,  and  requisite  flight  hours,  FPQs AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 53 will  be  identified  for  upgrade  by  squadron  leadership  via  the  STRP.    FPQs  require  a minimum of one AF Form 8 evaluation after FP mission ready certification and prior to entry  into  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade  (N/A  for  MAF  crossflow,  FAIP/OSA,  or  non-mobility weapon system Pilots). 5.3.4.3.  HQ AMC Orientation Tour GRACC (V282).  This event provides an in-depth look  at  selected  AMC  and  618  AOC  (TACC)  operations  as  well  as  an  opportunity  to interact  with  command  senior  staff.    The  course  is  offered  through  Defense  Connect Online  (DCO)  only.    Questions  regarding  vGRACC  virtual  class  dates  and  student enrollment  can  be  referred  to  the  POC  at  AMC.A3TA@us.af.mil.    Ideally,  this  course should  be  completed  by  Aircraft  Commander  candidates  after  completing  V281,  but before  beginning  formal  Aircraft  Commander  upgrade  training  (ACU).    vGRACC  is mandatory  for  AMC  Pilots  and  highly  encouraged  for  PACAF,  USAFE,  and  ARC mobility  forces  Pilots  upgrading  to  Aircraft  Commander.    vGRACC  is  transferable between all mobility weapon systems.  For AMC Pilots, V282 will be completed prior to Aircraft Commander certification.  If unable to complete V282 prior to certification, units may  schedule  attendance  up  to  90  days  after  certification;  beyond  90  days  requires OG/CC approval (see Paragraph 1.18.2 for scheduling details).  Additional information is available via ETCA (see Paragraph 1.15.3). (T-3). 5.3.5.  MPD Phase III.  Aircraft Commander Upgrade (ACU).  After the Sq/CC determines (via the STRP) an upgrade training start date, training time begins and the upgrade candidate will  begin  applicable  ACU  training  events,  as  required  (see  Table  1.2  for  in-unit  training time limitations).  Prior to starting training, the training office will open and maintain an AF Form 4022 until  the upgrade candidate is  certified as an Aircraft Commander.  Units using multiple  folders  to  document  a  Pilots  training  progress  may  combine  those  into  a  single training folder at the unit’s discretion.  MAJCOM approved training guides are authorized. 5.3.5.1.  Current  and  qualified  Aircraft  Commander  candidates  may  fly  as  FPQ’s  if  not accomplishing MPD Phase III training events.  If accomplishing MPD Phase III training requirements, IP supervision is required during non-critical phases of flight and direct IP supervision  is  required  during  critical  phases  of  flight.    Two  Aircraft  Commander candidates  may  sit  in  the  left  and  right  seats  under  IP  supervision  in  the  simulator,  as required. 5.3.5.2.  The Aircraft Commander candidate will accomplish the following requirements prior to the Aircraft Commander Review and Certification (R&C) Board: 5.3.5.2.1.  Formation Lead Certification (Q011).  Proficiency as formation lead must be demonstrated (see  Paragraph 5.6.1).  If simulator is used for Lead Certification, reference  Paragraph  5.6.1.2.2  for  Distributed  Mission  Operations  (DMO) requirements. 5.3.5.2.2.  Golf  Day  (Q028),  Heavy  Receivers  (KC-10,  C-5,  C-17,  E-4,  or  B-2).  Q028  is  normally  recommended  at  the  FTU  upon  graduation.    It  is  the  unit Commanders responsibility to determine if Q028 certification will be retained or need to  be re-accomplished during MPD Phase  II  or  Phase  III.   If directed, the  candidate must be able to demonstrate proficiency, as applicable and must be documented on an AF Form 4023 or approved Training Guide (TG) equivalent; ensure documentation is included in ACU training folder. 54 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 5.3.5.2.3.  Hazardous cargo (G182).  Accomplish CBT. 5.3.5.2.4.  Oceanic  Training  (M030).    Oceanic  mission  will  place  emphasis  on  AC duties,  oceanic  crossing  procedures,  as  well  as  enroute  and  mission  management training objectives.  For USAFE, an overnight mission must be accomplished.  IP led G160 will be completed in preparation for M030.  IP supervised current and qualified MPD Pilots will not be considered NMR for this event and may fly OCONUS for the purposes  of  oceanic  training.    Units  may  credit  this  event  during  MPD  Phase  II  if accomplished  with  an  IP  and  documented  on  an  AF  Form  4023  or  approved  TG equivalent; ensure documentation is included in ACU training folder. 5.3.5.2.5.  Demonstrate proficiency in Simulated Engine Failure events, Pattern work, Touch & Go’s, Tactics, and CRM. 5.3.5.2.6.  Aircraft  Commander  candidates  must  accomplish  Mission  Certification Training  events  listed  in  Table  3.1,    3.2,  and    3.3  prior  to  certification  unless identified by note. 5.3.6.  Evaluation  and  Certification.  Accomplish  an  Operational  Mission  Evaluation (OME)  according  to  AFI  11-2KC-135V2  and  document  Evaluation  in  AF4022  IAW  Para A2.2.  ACU culminates with a Sq/CC’s R&C Board recommendation. 5.3.7.  Mobility  Pilot  Designation  Codes.  Mobility  pilot  designation  codes  are  IAW  AFI 11-401 AMCSUP I, Aviation Management, AMC pilot designation codes. 5.4.  Aircrew  Instructor  Program  .    After  the  Sq/CC  determines  (via  the  STRP)  an  upgrade training  start  date,  the  training  office  will  open  an  AF  Form  4022  prior  to  beginning  training.  Instructor candidates will be selected based on experience, judgment, potential ability to instruct, flying skills, and technical knowledge.  Use Instructor upgrade flying time prerequisites in Table 5.1 for Pilots and Table 5.2 for Navigator/CSOs and Boom Operators.  These series of courses are designed to teach pre-selected Pilots and Boom Operators the fundamentals and concepts of instructing an aircrew member.  The courses will lead to qualification as KC-135 IP or IBO and includes  ground,  ATD,  and  flight  instruction  in  the  KC-135  aircraft  and  its  aircrew  training programs.  See the appropriate crewmember Instructor course syllabus for details. Table 5.2.  Navigator/CSO and Boom Operator Upgrade Prerequisites. Aircrew Position Total Flying Time Total -135 Time Navigator/CSO 750-hours 350-hours Note  1500-hours  700-hours Boom Operator Option 1 Option 2 NOTES: 1.  Total Flying Time (TFT) represents all flying time logged aboard a fixed wing aircraft.  ATD time is creditable to meet TFT requirement.   300-hours 500-hours  1 5.4.1.  Units  should  identify  and  send  the  names  of  candidates  to  fill  allocated  Instructor course  quotas to AMC/A3TF, or MAJCOM equivalent training quota managers no later than AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 55 45  days  before  class  start  date.    See  the  appropriate  syllabus  for  in-unit  course  training events. 5.4.2.  Pre-Instructor  Course  Training.  Units  will  provide  pre-attendance  simulator  or flying training to Instructor course candidates before school attendance.  The purpose of the additional flight or simulator training is to help prepare Instructor candidates to instruct while performing  the  maneuvers.    These  events  will  be  completed  by  the  Instructor  candidate demonstrating  to  their  Instructor  on  how  to  perform  the  procedure  and/or  techniques  that would assist other crew members.  When applicable, the Instructor candidate should provide instruction  throughout  the  pre-course  training.    Complete  the  appropriate  pre-attendance workbook  (A044),  lessons,  and  examination  available  on  ATS  contractor  website  (see Paragraph  1.15.2).    Candidates  must  successfully  complete  the  lessons  and  on-line examination  (85%)  before  proceeding  to  formal  school  outlined  in  the  syllabus.    This  pre-attendance  courseware  will  be  started  no  earlier  than  the  candidate  being  identified  by  the Sq/CC  IAW  Paragraph  1.4.5.2.2.    Pre-Instructor  flying  training  will  include,  but  is  not limited  to  the  following  (list  additional  requirements  are  in  the  appropriate  MAJCOM supplement): 5.4.2.1.  Pilot  — Minimum of three profiles (Sim or Sortie) with IP candidate acting in role  of  Instructor  on  all  flights.    Ample  time  will  be  allowed  for  sortie  pre-briefs  and critiques.  One sortie should concentrate on Instructor techniques, Instructor intervention, and  note  taking/communication  skills.    In  addition,  the  Instructor  should  discuss supervision,  situational  awareness,  task  management,  and  intervention  during  air refueling and transition, and personal limitations with the candidate.  Every opportunity should  be  used  for  the  candidate  to  practice  teaching  different  systems  or  procedures.  Examples  include  Amplified  Checklists,  Associated  Directives,  TOLD,  Landing Gear/Flaps  systems,  Flight  Controls,  Hydraulics,  Electrics,  Pneumatics,  Fuels,  or  APU.  Candidates must successfully complete the lessons and on-line examination (85%) before proceeding  to  formal  school  outlined  in  the  syllabus.    Emphasis  should  be  placed  on performing  events  within  prescribed  tolerances  using  appropriate  Instructor  techniques.  Complete  the  events  in  Table  5.3.    Individuals  who  have  not  accomplished  the  ground and  certification  training  (“G”  and  “Q”  events)  listed  in  Table  5.3,  must  complete  the events NLT Pilot Pre-Instructor Training Completion.  Units non-collocated with an OFT may require additional flight training. 5.4.2.1.1.  P215, Landing Attitude Demo must be accomplished in the aircraft. 5.4.2.1.2.

Pilot course for senior officers (O-6 selectees and above) who will fly under Instructor supervision. 5.  Instructor upgrade is available in-unit only (see Paragraph 5.4.2.2)  6.5.  Lesson  Objectives.  Use  lesson  objectives  as  a  reference  to  establish  training  and evaluation  standards.    The  KC-135  ATS  use  the  Master  Task  List  (MTL)  and  the  Evaluation Standards  Document  (MTL/ESD)  available  on  the  ATS  Contractor  website  (see  Paragraph 1.15.2). 6.5.1.  MTL  and  ESD  Purpose.    MTL  and  ESD  provide  the  basis  for  ATS  courseware development,  and  are a  principle source for evaluation  criteria (validate  MDS  crewmember performance). 6.5.1.1.  Courseware  development  and  Instructors  training  KC-135  crewmembers  may use criteria from the MTL and ESD to help determine the ability of an individual to meet performance  levels  required  to  be  mission-qualified.    For  evaluation,  use  AFI  11-2KC-135V2 criteria. 6.5.2.  Crew  resource  management  (CRM)  training.    The  KC-135  ATS  incorporates  CRM principles  during  all  phases  of  training  including  initial  and  continuation  training  to  meet requirements  of  AFI  11-290.    A  CRM  facilitator  course  is  also  available,  upon  request.  Instructors  use  AF  Form  4031,  CRM  Skills  Criteria  Training/Evaluation,  for  CRM  skills training IAW AFI 11-290. 6.6.  Unsatisfactory  Student  Progress  .    (See  Paragraph  1.16).    Any  time  during  a  trainee’s ATS ground instruction for formal school or unit-level continuation training, the ATS Instructor considers  training  progress  is  unsatisfactory,  lack  of  preparation  or  participation,  etc.,  the  ATS contractor will notify the unit training manager. 6.6.1.  Failure to Progress.  If a student fails to progress according to syllabus requirements, the command accomplishing the training will conduct a Progress Review (PR).  The PR can recommend continuation in  training or AFI 11-402, action, e.g., an  FEB  to  the individual’s unit commander.  The ATS contractor will identify students who fail to progress according to the ATS contract (see Chapter 6) AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 73 6.6.1.1.  Failure to Complete Training.  If crewmember fails to complete a formal course, the  formal  school  (ATS  contractor  will  notify  AMC/A3TK  for  training  deficiencies  at McConnell  AFB)  will  send  a  recommendation  of  action  to  the  individual’s  unit.    The recommendation will specify if the student should complete training in-unit, return to the formal  school  to  complete  training,  or  be  referred  to  the  AF  personnel  system  for reassignment. 6.7.  Courseware  Changes  .  While completing CBT, the user may also submit a comment or proposed  change  at  the  point  of  instruction  using  a  “Control  C”  input.    See  CBT  on-screen instructions on the opening to each CBT lesson.  The inputs are consolidated as part of the CBT centralized reporting function.  ATS contractor, in coordination with 97 TRS/TRK (if applicable) will monitor “Control C” inputs for consideration of future courseware updates. 6.8.  Scheduling. 6.8.1.  AMC/A3TK  ATS  Manager,  through  KC-135  ATS  Contracting  office  and  training group (AFMC AFLCMC/WNSPA), will determine Fiscal Year (FY) ATS formal school and continuation  training  requirements  (throughput)  for  all  ATS  courses.    PFT  reflects  the planned  annual  formal  school  throughput  based  on  Air  Force  requirements,  formal  school and ATD capacities, and contract authorizations.  ATD simulator scheduling at formal school is  managed  by  97  TRS,  Altus  AFB  in  coordination  with  the  ATS  Contractor,  Training Management System (TMS) scheduling office. 6.8.2.  Units  with  collocated  ATS  facility  schedule  directly  with  the  local  ATS  site.    Units without an ATS facility have been designated (by AMC/A3TK ATS Manager) to “QUEEN BEE” ATS facilities.  While an ATD undergoes conversions or hardware modifications the ATS  management  team  or  ATS  contractor  may  request  the  host  or  QUEEN  BEE  unit aircrews divert to sites with available training capacity.  The ATS contractors’ TMS office at Altus AFB and AMC/A3TK orchestrate the annual scheduling of KC-135 Pilots and QUEEN BEE sites in coordination with AFMC AFLCMC/WNSPA. 6.8.3.  Cancellation  of  ATS  Formal  School  Course  Quota.    Units  will  notify  their MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) staff (AMC AD call AMC/A3TF) within 45 days before class start date if a quota cancellation or no-fill is pending.  All formal school quota cancellations must  be  made  no  later  than  30  days  prior  to  class  start  date  to  enable  the  quota  to  be reallocated (see ETCA, Paragraph 1.15.3, for additional information).  For cancellations at McConnell AFB, notify MAJCOM/A3T (or equivalent) staff immediately and site scheduler as  early  as  possible  to  permit  reallocation/rescheduling.    Short  notice  cancellation  of  one student may result in the delay/cancellation of the paired Pilot. 6.9.  Administration. 6.9.1.  General.    Recurring  academic  and  ATD  training  ensures  required  subject  training materials are presented in a realistic manner on a programmed/phased basis. 6.9.2.  Objective.    Ensure  all  crewmembers  maintain  the  proficiency  to  safely  operate  the KC-135  aircraft  and  effectively  perform  the  assigned  mission.    Crewmembers  will  use  the ATD  to  enhance  the  training  areas  (e.g.,  windshear/microburst  training,  low  visibility approaches,  systems  knowledge,  emergency/abnormal  procedures,  and  degraded  navigation systems). 74 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 6.10.  Training Implementation/Student Expectations. 6.10.1.  Self-Study.    Each  crewmember  is  responsible  for  their  adequate  preparation  before reporting  for  each  ATD  profile.    Review  the  mission  profile,  pre-course  study  material, associated  normal,  abnormal,  and  emergency  procedures,  and  applicable  aircraft  systems.  Each crewmember must review the applicable portions of the flight publications and answer review exercises questions located in the OFT or BOWST/BOSS profile. 6.10.2.  Pre-mission.  The ATS/military Instructor will conduct a pre-mission briefing before each  OFT  or  BOWST/BOSS  profile  and  cover  the  mission  overview,  academic  session overview  (if  applicable),  systems,  aircraft  loading,  performance  data,  route-of-flight, communications,  takeoff  weather,  simulator  discrepancies,  and  ATD  emergency  egress.  Also  include  mission  objectives,  special  procedures  specific  (required)  training  items, scheduled  systems  and  performance  training,  CRM,  and  any  additional  area  of  emphasis.

These forms are prescribed in AFI 11-2C5 Volume 1, C5 Aircrew Training. A2.1.1.  Create  an  AF  Form  4022  for  ETCA  formal  training  courses  (formal  school  or  in-unit),  mission  certification,  special  qualification  and  certification  (if  simulator  or  flight  is required,  in-unit  upgrade  program  to  the  next  higher  crew  qualification,  requalification training  (formal  school  or  in-unit),  AC  upgrade  training,  and  all  corrective  action  or additional  training  requiring  a  simulator  or  flight  (if  directed  by  the  squadron  commander).  (see  AMC/A3T SharePoint®, Universal  Aircrew Training, for examples  of AF  Form 4022, 4023, 4024, 4025).  Exception: WIC Instructors and students will follow the documentation directed by USAFWS.  MCT requirements may be tracked with Cadre Instructor (CIC) when accomplished simultaneously and do not require a separate AF Form 4022. A2.1.1.1.  The  unit  operations  officer  may  waive  the  training  folder  requirement  if corrective  action  or  additional  training  is  limited  (e.g.,  if  no  simulator  or  flight  is required).    If  initiated,  the  Instructor  or  flight  examiner  who  evaluated  the  aircrew member’s  performance  will  enter  comments  pertinent  to  the  training  deficiency  on  AF Form 4023 or the electronic training folder.  Use the existing AF Form 4022 for end-of-course evaluations that result in additional training. A2.1.1.2.  At  the  unit’s  discretion,  training  folders  for  an  individual  undergoing  more than one training program in a short period of time may combine all training into one AF Form 4022; for example, a MPD Pilot upgrading to AC may have the upgrade, mission qualification, and formation lead training combined in one folder. A2.1.1.3.  Electronic  Training  Folders  and  forms  are  authorized.    MAJCOM  approved Unit Developed Electronic Training Folder programs (i.e. GTIMS) are authorized as long as it complies with Attachment 2 of this section and AF Forms 4023, 4024 and 4025 are used.  Overprints cannot alter the original form.  Altering of AF Forms 4023, 4024, and 4025 are not authorized without AMC/A3TK approval.  Electronic Training Folders and reports not reproduced on paper for inclusion in the AF Form 4022, must be stored in 2 places (a primary and a backup) for at least one year.  After one year, training offices will retain a copy of the AF Form 4025 in a permanent record and provide the crewmember with  a  copy  of  the  electronic  training  folder.    AF  Form  4025s  will  be  sent  with  the members Flight Records Folder upon change of station for the receiving training office to hold on file. A2.1.1.3.1.  Electronic versions must be password protected or require an individual user  to  login  to  ensure  data  integrity  (individual  will  have  read  only  access  to  their files). 176 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 A2.1.1.3.2.  Digital  signatures  are  authorized  using  “//signed//”  plus  the  individuals’ name. A2.1.2.  Formal  schools  will  send  AF  Form  4022  or  electronic  training  folder  with  all training records to the trainee’s gaining unit.  This may be done electronically at the gaining unit’s  request.    Sq/CC  will  review  formal  school  training  records  and  enter  appropriate comments  and  signature  on  the  training  guide  progress  record,  electronic  training  folder  or AF  Form  4023.    Exception:  WIC  training  folders  will  be  maintained  IAW  USAFWS direction at the 509 WPS. A2.1.3.  The  unit  (typically  squadron-level)  will  maintain  the  training  folders  for  assigned personnel  in  a  location  readily  accessible  to  Instructors  and  supervisory  personnel.    The trainee may review his or her folder at any time. A2.1.4.  The Instructor or trainer will review the training folder, to include AF Forms 4023 and  4024  or  the  training  guide,  prior  to  all  training  periods.    Those  areas  not  previously accomplished  or  those  in  which  crewmembers  require  additional  training,  will  be  noted  for possible  inclusion  during  the  current  training  period.    Sq/CC  or  Sq/DO  will  review  active training folders quarterly, and Flt/CCs or Sq training representatives will conduct a monthly review.  Annotate monthly and quarterly reviews on AF Form 4023 or in the training guide.  Quarterly reviews fulfill the requirement for monthly reviews for the month the review was completed.  Note: Due to the frequency of review, and brief course length at the FTU, the 97 OG/CC will determine the requirement to review student training documentation. A2.1.5.

Also,  annotate  the  date  the  training  occurred.    If  one 180 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 form is used to document continuous missions during a single TDY with the same Instructor, annotate each flight date and period. A2.3.2.  AT,  GT,  FLY,  and  ATD  (Items  2,  4,  and  6).    Annotate  time  allocated  for  training and  keep  a  running  total  (Items  3,  5  and  7)  by  adding  previous  totals  to  current  training period  time.    FTU  classroom  academic  training  periods  will  be  annotated  as  AT  and tabulated under the ground training block.  Any training event that does not have an ARMS identifier  will  be  documented  on  an  AF  Form  4023  or  training  guide  (e.g.  RNAV  GPS ground training, Formation Lead ground training, Local Area Brief, Tactics ground training, EMCON 3 & 4, etc.).  Note:  For formal schoolhouse, 97 OG will determine applicability of items 2-8. A2.3.3.  Total Training Time (Item 8).  Keep a running total of all training time (add items 3, 5, and 7). A2.3.4.

Recommendations will be specific and include tasks  requiring  further  training  and  the  type  of  training  required.   If  Instructor recommendations are not followed, document rationale on the AF Form 4025.  If more space is  required for annotating remarks, draw vertical arrows through sortie information  heading section (Items 1 through 8) and continue remarks. A2.3.4.1.  Operations  Review.    In  addition  to  reviewing  all  AF  Form  4023  entries,  the training  Flt/CC  or  a  Sq/DOT  representative  will  conduct  a  monthly  review  of  active status AF Forms 4022.  The Sq/CC or Sq/DO will review active status AF Forms 4022 at least  once  each  quarter.    Document  reviews  on  an  AF  Form  4023  (see  Paragraph 1.4.6.8).    The  reviewer  will  annotate  “monthly  review”  or  “quarterly  review,”  as applicable,  in  the  training  period  block.    Operations  review  will  be  annotated,  and  if required,  a  separate  entry  in  the  training  record  including  comments  on  the  student’s progress will be made.  Initial reviews by Sq/CC’s fulfill the requirement for the monthly and quarterly review for the month and quarter the review was completed. A2.3.4.2.  Monthly  reviews  are  not  required  for  formal  school  courses  except  in documented  cases  of  unsatisfactory  progress.    In  this  case,  the  training  Flt/CC’s  initials on  the  AF  Form  4023  or  training  guide  satisfies  this  requirement.    ATS  personnel  will review  the  student’s  records  and  ensure  all  required  training  is  completed  prior  to entering  flight  training.    If  problems  are  encountered  during  the  flying  phase,  the squadron will conduct reviews necessary to document unsatisfactory progress. A2.3.4.3.  When  the  trainee  attains  sufficient  knowledge,  experience,  and  prerequisites for  upgrade,  the  Instructor  will  recommend  an  evaluation  and  state:    “Recommend evaluation  for  (crew  position)”  on  the  training  progress  record.    Trainees  will  not  be recommended  for  an  evaluation  if  a  TG  required  event  is  incomplete  or  requires corrective  action.    Exception:  MPD  Pilot  ATS  progress  reviews  (evaluations)  may  be administered with open areas in the TG. AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 181 A2.3.5.  Instructor Block (Item 10).

A2.4.11.1.  Regression.    Once  a  crewmember  has  received  “P”  for  an  event,  the  only subsequent grades allowed for that event are either “P” or “U”.  Regression occurs when a maneuver is graded “U” after having achieved “P” in the same task.  Regression from a “P” to a “U” requires an associated remark on AF Form 4023 explanation in the student’s training  folder.    The  overall  grade  is  at  the  Instructor’s  discretion.    For  regression,  the student will re-obtain proficiency prior to the end of the block of training in order to be recommended  for  an  evaluation  (when  applicable)  or  certification  (when  applicable).  Regression rules only apply to the training program that the student is currently enrolled in (i.e., an IQT graduate that starts MCT at their new assignment may be graded “S” on any training event that has not been previously graded “P”). A2.5.  Instructions for AF Form 4025. A2.5.1.  For  each  training  program  complete  a  summary  and  close-out  report,  upon completion of the defined final training program events, including: Evaluation, IP “sign-off” and  Sq/CC  certification.    This  form  summarizes  the  individual’s  strengths,  weaknesses, overall performance, and other pertinent information.  Strengths and weaknesses should be a “Trend” (i.e., noted on at least two training reports).  A copy of this report will be filed in the crewmembers training folder after completion of training (see Paragraph A2.1.5). A2.5.2.  Sq/CC,  Sq/DO  or  training  Flt/CC  will  ensure  the  comments  on  AF  Form  4025  do not  reflect  personal  opinions  or  biases.    All  comments  must  be  supported  by  information contained in  the AF  Forms  4023 and 4024 as applicable.  At formal  schools,  the  Instructor will  accomplish  the  AF  Form  4025,  Sq/CC  signature  is  optional.    Digital  signatures  are authorized.  After one  year, training offices should retain a copy of the AF Form 4025 in a permanent record and return the AF Form 4022 to the crewmember. A2.6.  Aircrew Training Guides (TG)  . A2.6.1.  The FTU ATS contractor will develop a TG.  Units may also produce TGs, but must  coordinate  development  through  appropriate  MAJCOM  for  approval.    Minor  updates  to previously  approved  content  do  not  require  approval;  however,  changes  must  be  sent  to MAJCOM/A3TK for review. 184 AFI11-2KC-135V1  3 JANUARY 2017 A2.6.2.  Initiating TG.  Training and resource management personnel in each unit will initiate a TG on crewmembers prior to their entering any phase of qualification training.  These TG will be inserted in AF Form 4022 and may be used in lieu of AF Forms 4023 and 4024.  An original  AF  Form  4023  is  optional  if  a  MAJOM  approved  training  guide  (see  Paragraph A2.6),  electronic  training  folder  program  or  GTIMS  equivalent  product  is  used  to  record training.
