This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.    NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions may use Part II to support duty position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.  Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, experience, and other mandatory requirements).  Section D indicates resource constraints such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SrA through MSgt.  2.2.  Part II provides information necessary for documenting task completion.  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the course objective list and training standards which supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) which may be developed to support proficiency training.  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.     1  Abbreviations and Terms Explained  Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL).  ADL is an evolution of distributed learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable objects, networks, and learning management systems, yet may include some legacy methods and media.  ADL is structured learning that takes place without requiring the physical presence of an instructor.  Although the Air Force uses the term advanced distributed learning, some federal agencies and DoD components may use the term distance learning.  These terms refer to the same basic concept.  Advanced Training (AT).  Formal course that provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills and knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.  Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced level of the AFS.  Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).  Representative appointed by the respective HQ USAF Deputy Chief of Staff or Under Secretariat, to ensure assigned AF specialties are trained and utilized to support AF mission requirements.  AFCFM is the OPR; however, works in concert with MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, ANG, and AFRC Functional Managers (FMs) as required.  Serves as the primary advocate for the career field, addressing issues and coordinating functional concerns across various staffs. Responsible for the career field policy and guidance.  Air Force Job Qualification Standard/Command Job Qualification Standard (AFJQS/CJQS).  A comprehensive task list, which describes a particular job type or duty position.  They are used by supervisors to document task qualifications.  The tasks on AFJQS/CJQS are common to all persons serving in the described duty position.  Air Force Training Record (AFTR).    An internet application that is accessible from any .mil or .com location via the Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS).  AFTR is designed to track career field management for all Active Duty, Air Force Reserve (AFR), and Air National Guard (ANG) personnel.  Airman Leadership School (ALS).  The first of three career enhancement, professional military education formal training courses teaching leadership and management principles.  Black Belt (BB).  BBs are experienced process improvement practitioners and have significant and recognized process improvement experience.  They are capable of applying Six Sigma and Theory of Constraints process improvement methodologies, as well as Lean concepts.  BBs are equipped with skills and competencies to facilitate teams across organizational boundaries to solve complex process/performance problems, particularly those with vertical/horizontal integration, i.e., cross-functional/cross-echelon.  BBs display a level of mastery of continuous process improvement (CPI) tools and principles on a level that delivers transformation and sustainable lean operations across organizational value streams.  Career Development Course (CDC).  CDCs directly support OJT and satisfy career knowledge requirements for skill level Upgrade Training (UGT). 2   Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP).  A CFETP is a comprehensive core training document that identifies: life-cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for a specialty.  The CFETP aims to give personnel a clear path and instill a sense of industry in career field training.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  A regionally accredited institution where Air Force personnel can earn an associate of applied science degree for the military training they receive.   Continuation Training.  Additional advanced training exceeding the minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present or future duty assignments.  Core Task.

Purpose. This CFETP provides the information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the training that individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use.  The plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courseware can satisfy identified requirements.  MAJCOM developed training to support this AFS must be identified for inclusion in this plan. 7   2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval. The AFCFM is the approval authority.  Also, the AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  Section B - Career Field Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training must do his or her part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure that each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.    6.  Training Decisions. The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Manpower career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  Training decisions were made at the 15-17 July 2014 STRT/U&TW.  6.1.  Initial Skills Training.  The initial skills course was revised to provide training needed to prepare graduates for manpower related positions.   6.2.  Five-Skill Level Training.  The Manpower Career Development Course (CDC), reinforces and expands on the initial skills taught in the apprentice course, while working on-the-job.  9  6.3.  Seven-Skill Level Training.  Completion of local training requirements.    6.4.  Proficiency Training.  This training is job qualification and consists of completing all identified core tasks for their assigned duty position.  Additional qualification training (QT) becomes necessary when personnel transfer to another duty position, the unit mission changes, a new personnel program comes on board, or any time any techniques, procedures, or a need for increased productivity occurs.  7.  Community College of the Air Force.  Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Sciences Degree.  Visit the CCAF website for the current catalog http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/.  In addition to its associate’s degree program, CCAF offers the following:   7.1.  CCAF Instructor Certification (CIC) Program. CCAF offers the three-tiered CIC Program for qualified instructors teaching at CCAF affiliated schools who have demonstrated a high level of professional accomplishment. The CIC is a professional credential that recognizes the instructor's extensive faculty development training, education and qualification required to teach a CCAF course, and formally acknowledges the instructor's practical teaching experience. To learn more, visit CCAF at http://www.au.af.mil/au/barnes/ccaf/.   7.2.  Instructor Educational Requirements.  Individuals desiring to become an Air Education and Training Command Instructor should be actively pursuing an associate’s degree.  A degreed faculty is necessary to maintain accreditation through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.  7.3.  Recommendation. It is strongly recommended that all enlisted personnel in the Manpower and Organization Career Field have CCAF degrees from their prior AFSC and one from their new AFSC.  8.  Professional Affiliations and Fraternal Organizations.   The Air Force recognizes the importance and supports associations with professional organizations and membership in fraternal organizations as a vital tool in your continuing education and professional development.  Such affiliations and membership offer opportunities for tangible benefits in the areas of leadership, networking, team-building, communication, community service, and most of all, career enhancement.  9.  Career Field Path  9.1.  Manpower Life Cycle Training.  The Manpower training cycle is different from most other specialties due to being a lateral career field.  In addition to retraining in personnel from different year groups, recruiting and retraining within different grades compound the challenge of charting a by-year/by-grade progression in this specialty.  The chart below is provided only as an overview of a typical training cycle with consideration for Manpower’s uniqueness.  10  JOB QUALIFICATION AND SPECIAL SKILLS TRAINING UPGRADE TRAINING UPGRADE TRAINING Award AFSC 3 Skill  Level Award 5 Skill Level Award 7 Skill Level Manpower Apprentice Course    In residence 7 weeks Manpower Journeyman  Career  Development Course  Self-Paced     2 MONTHS 9-12 MONTHS 6-12 MONTHS  S E L E C T I V E  R E C R U I T M E N T                         Award CEM Code Award 9 Skill Level 11  • Resources Legislation •• Compliance PPBE/FYDP •• Ceiling/Floors • Military Grades • Consultant Services • Continuous Performance Improvement (CPI) Performance Analysis •• Competitive Sourcing Improve Performance Organization Structure Requirements Determination Program Allocation & Control LCOM •• Wartime • Reengineering • Manpower Standards 9.2.   Manpower and Organization Core Competencies                • Activations  Inactivations • • Redesignations • Reorganizations  • Objective  Structures        9.2.1.  The Manpower and Organization function is structured around four core competencies: Requirements Determination, Program Allocation and Control, Organization Structure, and Improve Performance.  These competencies were established during Manpower’s functional reengineering effort.  A well-rounded training program should introduce and utilize Manpower personnel in as many of these competencies as possible over a period of time.    9.2.2.  The Specialty Training Standard (STS) is organized to reflect these competencies and includes supporting processes, tasks, and subject areas.  Because of the diverse skills offered by this specialty, an individual may perform only a few of these at a particular duty assignment.  The objective of a sound individual development training plan is to expose personnel to as many areas of this specialty through job rotation and different levels of assignment.  9.2.3.  Core tasks identified in the STS and Readiness JQS are intended to ensure the technician has an overarching understanding of the core competencies.  Like previous core task documentation requirements, once upgrade training is completed, supervisors are required to readdress these items as an individual’s duty position and responsibilities change.  For upgrade training requirements, the supervisor will determine at what level and at what depth the core task should be trained for duty performance.  That determination should be documented appropriately in the individuals training record.  12  9.3.

This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC Apprentice classes beginning 151001 and graduating 151124.   2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:  2.1.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.  2.2.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task qualification must show a completed date.  2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.    2.4.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.  2.5.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  2.5.1.  Documentation.  Using the master task list (MTL), identify all duty position requirements, including those core tasks associated with the current duty position as directed by the AFCFM or MFM, by circling the sub-paragraph number next to the task statement.  As a minimum, complete the following columns in Part II of the CFETP:  training start date (day, month, year), training complete date (day, month, year), trainee initials (upon completion of training), trainer initials (upon completion of training) and Certifier initials when required by AFCFM (for tasks requiring third-party certification).  An AFJQS may be used in lieu of Part II of the CFETP only upon approval of the AFCFM.    Note:  The AFCFM may supplement these minimum documentation procedures as needed or deemed necessary for his/her career field.    Note:  All entries on documents contained in or on the AF Form 623, to include the CFETP, AFJQS, AF Form 797, AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, AF Form 803, and any additional training documents as determined by local requirements, will be documented in pencil, unless forms are automated and tracked in an approved electronic system.  17  Entries on forms that are not subject to change, such as the front cover of the AF Form 623, signatures and AF Form 623a entries will be made in black or blue ink.  However, if these publications/forms make up an automated training documentation package, pencil entries are not required.   Note:  Training on all applicable core tasks is still required for upgrade unless otherwise stated by the AFCFM.  Deviations in documentation of the MTL may be necessary when using electronic records as long as all required tasked are recorded on the document.  2.5.1.1.  Transcribing.  Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training.  Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of documentation.  Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of CFETP revision date or from date revision is posted to automated training records system.  Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe:  2.5.1.1.1.  Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP.  2.5.1.1.2.  For tasks previously qualified/certified and required in the current duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion column.  Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column.  2.5.1.1.3.  For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials).  If the task later becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials.  2.5.1.1.4.  Annotate the AF Form 623a or automated version, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.”  Signed and dated by supervisor and trainee).  2.5.1.2.  Knowledge training.  Knowledge training is required if no CDC is available for the AFS or training must be documented for a CDC waiver.  Define (and develop, if necessary) evaluation criteria for career knowledge items to ensure comprehension.  Document knowledge training IAW paragraph 2.5.1.  Note:  Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  2.5.1.3.  Decertification and Recertification.  When a supervisor determines an airman is unqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor erases the previous certification, or deletes certification when using automated system.  Appropriate remarks pertaining to the reason for decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a.  Begin recertification (if required) following procedures in paragraph 2.5.1.  2.5.2.  Performance Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local demands for accuracy, 18  timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go” level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key).  2.6.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the ANG.  3.  Recommendations.  Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC training.  A customer service information line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisors' convenience.  For a quick response to concerns, call our CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or fax us at DSN 597-3790, or e-mail us at 81trg-tget@us.af.mil. Reference this STS and identify the specific area of concern (paragraph, training standard element, etc.).   BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE                                       SAMUEL D.
