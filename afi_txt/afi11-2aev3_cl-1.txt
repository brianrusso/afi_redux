OXYGEN - ON, 100% NOTE: Protective Breathing Equipment (PBE) or Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) may be used if oxygen mask/eye protection are not available. If a PBE is not available and the Emergency Passenger Oxygen System (EPOS) is the only available source, the AECM will cease crew duties and be seated until the PIC has directed crew members to remove emergency oxygen. NOTE: The MA-1 portable oxygen bottle delivers 100% oxygen at all settings. The regulator does not have to be turned to “emergency” to provide 100% oxygen. WARNING: Removal of oxygen masks when smoke or fumes are present can result in personal injury or death. 2. CREW ALERTED 3. FIRE COMBAT AS DIRECTED NOTE: The pilot/LM/BO will direct crewmembers to fight the fire as required. Crewmembers not directly involved with combating the fire will proceed with their emergency procedures checklist. WARNING: Although Halon 1211 vapor has a low toxicity, its decomposition products can be hazardous. On decomposition, Halon 1211 has a characteristic sharp, acrid odor, even in concentrations of only a few parts per million. The odor provides a built-in warning system for the agent and at the same time creates a noxious, irritating atmosphere for those who are in the hazard area during and following a fire. Leave and/or ventilate area after fighting a fire. NOTE: To use the Halon 1211 fire extinguisher, hold in a vertical position, about eight feet from the fire. Remove the pull-ring pin and aim nozzle at base of the fire. Squeeze lever and sweep agent across base of fire. 4.
