Overview.1.1.1.   Force Protection (FP) is a collection of activities that deter, detect, mitigate,or  negate  threats  or  hazards  to  Air  Force  interests,  which  prevent  or  detract  frommission accomplishment.  The AFMS largely contributes to FP through Force HealthProtection  (FHP).    FHP  is  a  total  life-cycle  health  support  system  that  addresseshealth-related threats affecting combat forces and the supporting community before,during, and after deployment.  Three central  pillars  support  FHP:    Healthy  and  FitForce, Casualty Prevention, and Casualty Care and Management.  The ability of theAir Force to conduct sustained combat operations is dependent on the  resilience ofthe human weapons system.  When the human weapons system is injured or becomesill, operations suffer a decrement and additional resources are required to manage thecasualty  and  replace  the  asset.    Air  Force  Medical  Service  casualty  preventionactivities  are  aimed  directly  at  supporting  sustained  combat  operations  bypreserving our most valuable asset:  highly skilled and trained personnel.1.1.2.  This  TTP  provides  guidance  to  medical  commanders  and  personnel  on  theprevention  against  the  full  spectrum  of  health  threats  facing  today’s  forces  whileconducting  expeditionary  operations.    This  chapter  lays  out  the  basic  principles  ofcasualty prevention followed by Roles and Responsibilities in Chapter 2.  The nextthree  chapters  discuss  casualty  prevention  for  expeditionary  operations  through  thephases of pre-deployment, deployment and re-deployment, followed by a section oninformation  management.  Finally,  Chapter  7,  Education  and  Training  lists  some  ofthe  essential  courses  that  help  commanders  and  others  understand  and  implementeffective casualty prevention.1.2. Casualties.  Casualties are personnel unavailable for duty due to illness or injury.The  types  of  casualties  are  Disease/Non-Battle  Injuries  (DNBI)  and  BattlefieldInjuries/illnesses  (BI).    (See  Figure  1.1).    Both  have  operational  relevance,  as  anycasualty is a reduction in the availability of our most valuable asset.  DNBI is largely aresult of our own actions (or inaction),  while BI is a direct or indirect consequence ofenemy actions.  Historically, DNBI has accounted for 60 to 90 percent of the  casualtytotal.    However,  with  our  enemies’  predicted  use  of  asymmetrical  threats  such  asChemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear  and High-Yield Explosives (CBRNE), ourdirect BI rates may increase.  Indirect BI (unexposed anxious personnel) may overwhelmmedical  treatment  facilities  and  dramatically  reduce  combat  effectiveness  if  noteffectively managed-- AFMS has a role in preventing both types of casualties.  AFMSalso has a role in identifying and preventing delayed casualties.  Delayed casualties arethose casualties whose symptoms may not be immediately apparent or whose symptomsdo not manifest for weeks, months, or even  years  after initial exposure or injury.   Forexample, victims of Gulf War Syndrome would be considered delayed casualties.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 20046Figure 1.1.   Types of CasualtiesBattleInjury/IllnessDNBI1.3.  Sources of Casualties. To ensure AFMS addresses the total health risks to an individualand assists commanders in instituting appropriate risk mitigation strategies, we must establish aworking model of the human weapons system environment.  The health hazards that affect thehuman weapons system can be reasonably categorized into three areas: hazards associated withwhere the force deploys (Force Environment), hazards generated by what the force is doing (ForceActivities), and hazards generated by the enemy (Attacks on the Force).  When any of these hazardsalign with human weapon system vulnerability, there is a viable risk and casualties may result(Figure 1.2).Figure 1.2.  Sources of Casualties.ForceEnvironmentAttacks onthe ForceForce Activities1.4.    Prevention  Strategies.  When  the  Sources  of  Casualties  figure  (Figure  1.2)  isoverlaid on the Types of Casualties figure (Figure 1.1), the relationship between hazardsAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 20047and  casualties  becomes  clear.    In  practice,  force  environment  and  force  preventionactivities support the prevention of DNBI (Figure 1.3).  The ultimate goal of preventivemedicine  activities  is  to  improve  mission  effectiveness  by  reducing/eliminating  bothbattlefield  illness/injury  and  Disease  Non-Battle  Injuries  (DNBI).    This  model  isapplicable to both garrison and expeditionary operations; only the proportion of the totalhealth risk on an individual from any single component changes.  An effective balance ofpreventive medicine activities based on a view of total health risk is required to achievethe ultimate goal of ensuring the force is available to prosecute the nation’s wars.Figure 1.3.  Causes and Effects of Casualties.Attacks on theForceForceEnvironmentForceActivities1.5.  Operational Risk Management (ORM). Throughout this document the principlesof ORM are used to give commanders and planners a framework to determine how tobalance risk and mission in terms of casualty prevention. It is useful to visit the conceptsof ORM as outlined in AFPD 90-9, Operational Risk Management.  One way to look atORM  is  the  use  of  a  matrix  (Figure  1.5).  The  matrix  has  two  axis,  severity  andprobability.  If we assign a severity and probability rating to a particular hazard, we canthen give it a risk level on a scale of low to extremely high. The ORM method is valuablebecause it gives us a relatively simple risk assessment methodology that is in the samelanguage as all other force protection vulnerability assessments, thus lending credibilityto the medical commander.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 20048Figure 1.4.  Operational Risk Management Matrix.1.6.    Conclusion.    The  remainder  of  this  TTP  is  devoted  to  providing  the  optimummedical  force  employment  and  planning  considerations  to  ensure  the  full  spectrum  ofhazards  facing  Air  Force  personnel  are  identified,  vulnerabilities  evaluated,  andappropriate risk mitigation strategies are advocated to the command structure.  Specificactions are required during each phase of the deployment cycle in order to minimize AirForce casualties.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 20049Chapter 2ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES2.1.  Overview. Many elements contribute to force protection and casualty prevention.This  section  describes  these  elements  as  well  as  the  linkages  between  Line  of  the  AirForce  and  Health  Service  Support  (HSS)  assets.    Commanders  at  all  levels  have  theresponsibility  for  protecting  Air  Force  personnel.    Command  and  control  structuresshould enable commanders to rapidly and effectively address passive defense issues andquickly  react  to  force  protection  threats  with  active  defensive  or  offensive  operations.The  overarching  nature  of  the  force  protection  effort  requires  it  be  coordinated  andintegrated at the highest levels and across all functional areas (see AFDD 2-4.1, ForceProtection  for  further  guidance).    AFMS  personnel  identify  potential  health  threats,develop  courses  of  action,  and  advise  commanders  of  the  risks  and  countermeasures.Commanders must decide how they will use the advice to ensure their units carry out theactions required (refer to Force Health Protection J-4 Publication.)2.2.  Command Relationships.2.2.1.    The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force.    The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  workingthrough  the  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  exercises  control  over  force  protectionprogramming,  training,  staffing,  manning,  and  developing  force  protection  policy.The Air Staff’s primary function lies in allocating additional forces and funding asneeded to fulfill force protection requirements. (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).2.2.2.    Major  Command  (MAJCOM).  MAJCOM  commanders  should  integrateforce  protection  requirements  into  every  aspect  of  their  activities.  They  shouldauthorize  cross-functional  coordinating  bodies  to  establish  guidance,  program,  andmanage all force protection requirements for the MAJCOM, and to coordinate withthe Air Staff.  (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).2.2.3.    Numbered  Air  Force  (NAF).    The  NAF  provides  representation  to  theMAJCOM cross-functional staffs for  force protection and  input  on  requirements  totheir MAJCOM force protection focal point.  (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).  Air  Force  Forces  (AFFOR). 2.2.4.   A  Commander,  Air  Force  Forces(COMAFFOR), will serve as the commander of Air Force forces assigned or attachedto a joint force. A combatant command-aligned NAF is typically re-designated as theAFFOR  (e.g.,  9th  Air  Force  serves  as  US  Central  Command  Air  Forces).    Thisorganizational structure may be tailored by the COMAFFOR to fit specific missionneeds. This staff does not exercise direct control over casualty prevention activities,but serves a planning, coordination, and oversight role. The combatant commander ofthe AOR is responsible for force protection OCONUS. Centralized control of forceprotection  resources  and  decentralized  execution  of  force  protection  measuresare essential to effectively protect our forces against each threat. (AFDD 2-4.1,Force Protection).AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004102.2.5.    Wing.    Wing  commanders  face  three  major  force  protection  challenges:planning  for  force  protection  integration  and  support  as  tasked  in  applicableoperational plans, training for force protection, and providing force protection forthose  interests  within  their  purview.  Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Wings  (AEWs)have the added responsibility of accomplishing force protection planning for the unitsidentified  to  deploy  to  their  location  during  contingency  operations.  Wingcommanders  should  integrate  force  protection  personnel  into  their  organizations  toestablish guidance, program, and manage force protection requirements for the wings.Wing commanders should also appoint a single force protection focal point, usually aForce  Protection  Working  Group,  that  should  be  trained  and  fully  versed  in  forceprotection issues and methodologies  (AFDD 2-4.1, Force Protection).2.3.    Health  Service  Support  (HSS)  Assets.      All  AFMS  assets  potentially  play  animportant  role  in  casualty  prevention.    This  section  discusses  some  assets  in  casualtyprevention.2.3.1.  Air Force Forces Surgeon (AFFOR/SG).  The AFFOR/SG is a member ofthe COMAFFOR special staff and is the director of USAF health service operations.The AFFOR/SG is responsible for overall health resources management and providesinformation on health surveillance, risk assessments, sustainment, and other casualtyprevention protection issues. AFFOR/SG will ensure preventive medicine personnelare integrated into all aspects of force planning.2.3.2.  Deployed Medical Commander (DMC).  The DMC is the commander of thedeployed  HSS  assets  and  is  responsible  to  the  AEW  commander  for  HSS  of  thedeployed  population.    The  DMC  oversees  health  and  injury/illness  preventionactivities  and  communicates  health  risks  to  the  AEW  commander.  The  DMCcommunicates and coordinates with the AFFOR/SG on theater medical support issuesand with other joint and combined medical units at the location.  The DMC shouldreport  DNBI  and  BI  rates  to  the  AFFOR/SG  as  well  as  medical  intelligence  andhealth risk information gathered at the deployed location.2.3.3.  Preventive and Aerospace Medicine (PAM) Team.  The PAM team consistsof  Aerospace  Medicine  Specialists,  Public  Health (PH),  BioenvironmentalEngineering  (BE),  flight  medicine  personnel,  and  Independent  Duty  MedicalTechnicians  (IDMTs).    The  team  oversees  basic  education  and  training  to  preventdisease  and  briefs  commanders  on  actual  threats,  safety  issues,  current  illness,  andcurrent  health  trends.    The  PAM  team  leader  should  be  considered  the  functionalexpert  in  casualty  prevention.    The  team  consists  of  3  unit  type  codes,  which  candeploy both in phases and simultaneously.2.3.3.3.  Flight Medicine.  The Aerospace Medicine Specialist (AMS) serves asthe  team  leader  and  integrates/directs  all  aspects  of  the  PAM  team.    Theyadditionally  provide  direct  health  care  to  flyers  and  special  operationspersonnel.    They  also  prescribe  prophylaxis/pretreatments,  evaluate  healthAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200411screenings, conduct medical maintenance of human weapon systems, and haveoversight  of  human  factor  issues  (i.e.,  training  and  implementation,  crewresource management, and counter fatigue).2.3.3.2.    Public  Health  (PH).    PH  officers  serve  as  Medical  IntelligenceOfficers  (MIO).    They  develop  the  medical  threat  estimate  and  coordinatepreventive medicine activities for subject matter experts and medical providers.Specifically,  PH  oversees  food  safety/security  surveillance,  communicabledisease control, occupational health education, insect and vector monitoring andcontrol, immunizations policy, as well as enhanced surveillance activities.  PHalso monitors disease trends for indications of overt or covert use of biologicalwarfare agents.in the force prevention environment 2.3.3.3.    Bioenvironmental  Engineering  (BE).    BE  personnel  spearheadcausality throughoccupational/environmental  surveillance  of  force  activities.    BE  personnelperform  an  Environmental  Health  Site  Assessment  (EHSA)  to  preventcausalities  related  to  the  force  environment.    BE  personnel,  as  the  Nuclear,Biological, and Chemical (NBC) Medical Defense Officer (MDO), prepare theenvironmental portion of the medical threat estimate, perform NBC and watervulnerability assessments, and recommend operational solutions that minimizethe adverse effects of NBC attacks on the force (working with Civil Engineeringpersonnel).    BE  personnel,  in  consultation  with  other  health-related  subjectmatter  experts,  are  experts  in  the  health  risk  assessment  of  occupational  andenvironmental  hazards  to  include  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  andNuclear (CBRN) hazards.  Specifically, BE personnel are trained to recognizethese threats, assess the risk to the force, and recommend measures to mitigateor control these hazards2.3.3.4.    Independent  Duty  Medical  Technician  (IDMT).    The  IDMTprovides  aerospace  medicine  support,  primary  care,  initial  site  survey,  andlimited  environmental  monitoring  for  water  and  food  safety,  field  sanitation,pest/vector control, sewage, and heat stress to units.2.3.4.  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and  High  Yield  Explosive(CBRNE) Assets.  In high threat environments, the PAM team is supplemented by theMedical  NBC  Team,  Biological  Augmentation  Team  and  Air  Force  Radiological  (See  AFTTP  3-42.3,  Health  Service  Support  in  NBCAugmentation  Team. Environments for further information.)2.3.5.  Medical Global Reach Laydown Team (MGRL).  The MGRL team is similarto the first increment of the PAM team.  The MGRL provides temporary, time sensitiveadvance team activities for Air Mobility Command (AMC) installations, but is replacedby a PAM team within two weeks.  That is, the MGRL team provides HSS for AMC’sstrategic airlift, rather than to the geographic combatant command. The MGRL shouldrelay all casualty prevention-related information to the next casualty prevention asset orAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200412Unit Type Code (UTC) to arrive at the site.2.3.6.  Life Skills.  Life Skills offers preventive interventions for individuals and units--stress  management,  counseling  services,  command  consultation,  risk  communication,spouses’  support  network,  personnel  input  into  rest  and  relaxation  policies  andschedules, and critical incident stress debriefings. In deployed settings, Life Skills willoperate an outpatient mental health clinic.  These services include mental health triage,management  of  combat/traumatic  stress,  and  psychopharmacological  services  (mostLife Skills providers will not have prescription authority).2.4.  Other Air Force Assets.2.4.1.  Civil Engineering (CE).   CE plays a key role in establishing and operating abase  (utilities,  base  laydown,  pest  control  and  other  functions)  as  well  as  CBNBEpassive  defense.    Close  coordination  with  CE  Operations  and  Readiness  Flights  isrequired to ensure casualty prevention concerns are taken into account.2.4.2.  Intelligence.  Intelligence plays a vital role in force protection as the primarycollection  and  dissemination  point  of  intelligence.    HSS  commanders,  MIOs  andMDOs  should  establish  relationships  with  the  local  intelligence  division,  ArmedForces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC), and/or Area of Responsibility (AOR)sources, as appropriate, and ensure they are receiving regular updates.  It is especiallyimportant that commanders, the MDO and MIO have appropriate security clearancesin order to access the appropriate intelligence information.2.4.3.    Public  Affairs.    Public  affairs  can  be  a  critical  asset  in  disseminatinginformation and dealing with the media.  It is essential that commanders engage withpublic affairs at the earliest possible time prior to deployment, but never give mediainterviews  without  notifying  public  affairs.    .    Public  affairs  aids  in  casualtyprevention by providing accurate, appropriate, and timely information to the public.2.4.4.    Chaplain  Services.    Spiritual  counseling  and  support  from  the  chaplainservice  is  another  preventive  intervention  to  reduce  the  threat  of  combat  andoperational stress reactions.2.4.5.  Services.  Air Force services personnel provide a critical role both in garrisonand deployed.   They manage  food  service  operations,  food  security,  billeting,  andmortuary affairs and oversee Morale, Welfare, and Recreation services.    2.4.6.  Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI).  AFOSI monitors localactivity of groups and individuals.  They provide a liaison with local law enforcementfunctions to aid in investigation of events that may be covert actions.2.4.7.    Force  Protection  Working  Group  is  a  senior  level  group  involving  WingStaff Agencies (Public Affairs, Chaplain, Safety, Judge Advocate), Medical Group,Mission  Support  Group  (Security  Forces,  AFOSI,  CE),  Operations  GroupAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200413(Intelligence) and Maintenance Group. This group evaluates force protection threatsfrom a variety of sources and prioritizes assets to reduce vulnerability.  This includesa coordinated risk assessment and communication strategy.2.4.8.    Family  Support  Activities.    It  is  important  to  communicate  accurateinformation to families in preparation for, during and after a deployment as much asis feasible.  This will serve to eliminate fears and promote a sense of safety amongstthose  family  members  and  active  duty  members  remaining  in  garrison.    Casualtyprevention  efforts  are  compromised  when familydecompensate and/or exhibits dysfunction.  In order to assist with minimizing missioncompromise,  active  duty  members  must  feel  certain  that  their  family  members  arebeing taken care of and that all is well on the home front.the  deployed  member’s 2.4.9.  Air Force Institute for Operational Health (AFIOH). 2.4.9.1.    Deployed  Site  Support.    AFIOH  maintains  a  number  of  readilydeployable highly specialized expert  teams  capable  of  supporting  AFFOR/SGfor  any  CBRNE  incident.   The  expertise  covers  the  full  spectrum—epidemiology, radiological, laboratory, environmental, and occupational health.In  addition,  the  array  of  consultants  can  support  field  study  requirements  asnecessary.2.4.9.2.    Reachback.    AFIOH  provides  chemical  and  radiological  analyticallaboratory services.    The institute is responsible for receiving and analyzingdeployment  health  and  environmental  surveillance  data  as  well  as  providingreports to all decision makers, from the field unit level to higher headquartersstaff throughout the Department of Defense (DOD).  AFIOH also serves as along-term  repository  for  deployment  health  and  environmental  data  from  AirForce  operational  sites.    Occupational,  environmental,  and  radiological  healthrisk  assessments  are  readily  available  as  is  specialized  team  training.Additionally, AFIOH will provide expert consultation on all CBRNE issues toinclude the specialized detection equipment.2.4.10.  Security Forces. Security Forces defend air bases by protecting personnel,resources, and information from threats that could destroy, damage, or compromisethe capability of the Air Force to perform its assigned missions.  Security forces alongwith  the  Services  Agency  (SVA)  are  responsible  for  food  security  (see  Air  ForceInstruction (AFI) 10-246 [Draft] Food and Water Protection for further guidance onthis issue).2.4.11.    Host  Nation/Other  Services.  HSS  is  greatly  enhanced  by  its  ability  tocooperate  with  host  nations.  Host  nation  civilians  and  military  personnel  haveinvaluable information on indigenous diseases, local hazards and other health risks.AFMS  personnel  cooperate  with  host  nations  through  programs  such  as  theInternational  Health  Specialists  program.    These  specialists  are  well  prepared  tointeract with host nations to prevent and if necessary, treat casualties.  Other servicesAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200414also have experience and medical intelligence that can assist in preventing casualties.American  embassies  can  provide  invaluable  information  and  some  assistance  incasualty prevention efforts.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200415                                                                Chapter 3PRE-DEPLOYMENT3.1.  Overview.  Pre-deployment casualty prevention is a broad area that encompasses awide range of activities during a potentially lengthy period of time.  Properly conductedpre-deployment casualty prevention efforts are critical to successful deployed operations.3.2.    Intelligence  Gathering.    Casualty  prevention,  a  force-multiplying  tool  forcommanders, is essential throughout the entire health cycle of deployed operations. Theactions  and  activities  taken  during  the  pre-deployment  phase  are  time  sensitive  andcannot  always  be  reproduced  later  in  the  cycle  of  the  deployment.  For  these  reasons,commanders  at  every  level  must  ensure  the  appropriate  pre-deployment  measures  areadministered  before  leaving  home  station.  These  activities  are  key  to  the  successfulexecution of deployment operations and the prevention of DNBI and BI.Threats and  Identifying Preventable 3.2.1. ImplementingCountermeasures/Infectious  Disease  Prevention.    Identification  of  preventablethreats is a cross functional skill set involving base level organizations (local MedicalTreatment Facility [MTF], Combatant Commander Staff Agencies, Intelligence unitsand support agencies such as the  AFMIC, Central  Intelligence Agency, host-nationAmerican Embassy, and the National Imaging and Mapping Agency).  Every effortmust  be  made  to  include  all  relevant  sources  to  consider  both  naturally  occurringthreats as well as manmade threats, particularly those posed by an enemy and or non-conventional  adversaries  such  as  terrorists.  Use  prior  food  and  water  vulnerabilityassessments,  after  action  reports  and  other  timely  data  at  the  deployed  location  tofurther  develop the  appropriate  assessment  and  countermeasures.  Once  allinformation is assembled, the MIO, in consultation with subject matter experts willdevelop the medical estimate and countermeasures.3.2.2.  Determine Need for Additional Data in the Theater of Operations.  Therepository  of  health  related  intelligence  is  extensive,  but  during  pre-deploymentplanning, it may become apparent that there is insufficient medical intelligence for acomprehensive Medical Estimate. For this reason, planning should include evaluatingthe need to send advance specialized teams to gather data on the specific location ofthe  deployment.    Planners  must  understand  that  due  to  the  time  criticality  ofoperations, casualty prevention decisions may have to be made before these theaterlevel  teams  can  assess  the  most  current  information.    Commanders  may  have  toemploy  the  ORM  strategy  using  available  information  and  be  prepared  to  makeadjustments.3.3.  Pre-Deployment Activities.    Determine  Appropriate  Medical  Surveillance  System  and3.3.1. Documentation  Systems.    Prior  to  deployment,  it  is  critical  for  commanders  andplanners  to  determine  the  appropriate  surveillance  systems.  Future  decisions  andAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200416adjustments  are  made  based  upon  accurate  data.  Selecting the  appropriatesurveillance  system  becomes  crucial.    Commanders  should  develop  surveillancesystems  that  are  redundant,  reproducible,  actionable  and  timely.  Such  systems  willinclude  Global  Expeditionary  Medical  System  (GEMS)  and  Medical  Report  forEmergencies, Disasters, and Contingencies to document deployment data and, GlobalEmerging Infections Systems/ Electronic Surveillance System for Early Notificationof  Community-based  Epidemics  and  Air  Force  Complete  Immunizations  TrackingApplication  to capture baseline data in garrison prior to deployment.3.3.2.   Assessing the Health Status of the Force.  Only healthy and fit membersshould  deploy  in  support  of  contingency  operations.  There  is  a  direct  relationshipbetween  casualty  prevention  and  health  status.  For  this  reason,  members  will  beevaluated for health status using all available resources.  As a minimum, home stationmedical  personnel  will  review  the  Personal  Individual  Medical  Readiness  or  theReserve  Component  Periodic  Health  Assessment  computerized  database  andoutpatient medical record and ensure deploying personnel are medically qualified todeploy.   Immunizations. 3.3.3.   Immunizations  are  provided  IAW  AFJI  48-110,Immunizations  and  Chemoprophylaxis.    When  vaccines  are  available  to  protectagainst  a  validated  disease  or  Biological  Warfare  (BW)  threat,  it  is  DOD  policy(DODD 6205.3, DOD Immunization Program for Biological Warfare Defense) thatpersonnel  will  be  immunized  with  sufficient  time  to  develop  immunity  beforedeployment to threat areas.  Investigational New Drug protocols should be  followed,if  applicable.    The  combatant  or  theater  commander  may  specify  immunizationrequirements for the deployed location that must be followed.3.3.4.    Chemoprophylaxis.    Chemoprophylaxis  for  some  naturally  occurring  andbiological, radiological, and chemical agents are available and will be issued at thetime  of  deployment  IAW  theater  policy  or  issued  from  bulk  storage  at  forwarddeployed  locations.    Theater  deployers  must  be  trained  prior  to  deployment  on  theproper use of these preventive measures.  Examples include nerve agent pretreatmentsand medications for the prevention of endemic diseases such as malaria.3.3.5.    Medical  Estimate  Operational  Health  Risk  Briefing.    The  MIO  (ordesignee) will brief deploying forces on  the  deployed  health  risk  threats  including:environmental  hazards,  endemic  diseases,  hazardous  insects,  plants,  and  animals,NBC threat, and appropriate countermeasures.  MIO guidance found in AFI 41-106,Medical  Readiness  Planning  and  Training.    Medical  intelligence  is  available  frommany sources.  The primary source is AFMIC, however, the MIO should also acquireand be cognizant of current operational intelligence of the deployment location.  Themedical threat briefing should be provided sufficiently early (ideally at the conceptbriefing,  and  directly  to  the  troops)  to  permit  deploying  troops  to  pack  neededclothing and supplies and to take appropriate actions prior to deployments.3.3.6.    Pre-Deployment  Medical  Assessment  (DD  Form  2795,  Pre-DeploymentAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200417Health  Assessment  Questionnaire)  This  assessment  must  be  completed  for  alldeployments that meet the DODI 6490.3 definition of a deployment.  For the purposeof joint health surveillance, a deployment is defined as a troop movement resultingfrom  a  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS)/combatant  command  deployment  order  for  30continuous days or greater to a land-based location outside the United States.  Thedeployed location does not have permanent US military MTFs and may or may not bedirectly  supported  by  deployed  medical  forces.    Use  most  current  guidance  ondeployment health surveillance as mandated by DOD instructions, JCS memoranda,and public law.  The medical assessment becomes important during pre-deploymentplanning because the questionnaire establishes the health status of the individual priorto leaving home station. Individual health readiness is a key component of casualtyprevention.3.3.7.  Classified Material.  Casualty prevention often entails dealing with classifiedmaterial.    AFMS  personnel  should  ensure  personnel  have  the  proper  securityclearances  to  access  the  appropriate  intelligence.    In  addition,  AFMS  commandersshould consider the need for dedicated classified equipment such as Secret InternetProtocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and Secure Transmission Equipment or SecureTelephone  Unit-Third  Generation.    AFMS  personnel  should  also  be  sensitive  tochanges  to  intelligence  classification.    For  example,  a  PH  officer  may  report  someinformation  to  intelligence  that  is  subsequently  made  classified  because  of  itssensitive nature.3.4.  Total Environmental and Occupational Health Pre-Risk Assessment.3.4.1.  Environmental Threat Estimate.  BE and PH should gather intelligence onthe medical threats associated with operating at the deployed location.  Intelligencegathering should at least explore the ambient environment (air, soil, water), specificlocation, and availability/suitability/vulnerability of local food and water.3.4.2.  Potential Threat Identification.  MDO and MIO must consider and researchthe  ambient  threats  potentially  present  at  the  deployed  location  and  makerecommendations to the DMC and line commanders to ensure proper resources aredeployed/in-place and  personalregarding  operations actions/behaviors are implemented to manage the risk of the hazards.that  policies and 3.4.3.  Site Specific Environment:  There are operational risks associated with livingand operating from a specific location.  The amount of information available variesdramatically with the degree of national industrialization.3.4.3.1.  Potential Threat Identification.3.4.3.1.1.    Water  Sources.    The  potable  water  source  is  critical  tosustained  operations.    The  primary  source  of  drinking  water  is  typicallybottled water until the safety of local water resources can be determined.Bottled  water,  however,  must  also  be  tested.    Local  vendors  haveAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200418attempted  to  sell  “contaminated”  bottled  water  to  US  forces  in  recentcontingencies.  Research should be conducted to determine the source oflocal  water  (well,  surface,  desalinated  seawater)  and  vulnerability  topollution and/or covert contamination.  Water treatment options should bedeveloped in partnership with CE and an interim drinking water plan mayneed  to  be  in-place.    If  surface  water  is  to  be  used,  ensure  USAF  orcoalition operations do not contaminate potential water sources.   (Section4.4.2.2. contains further information on Bottled Water sources).3.4.3.1.2.   Toxic  Industrial  Chemicals  (TICs)/Toxic  IndustrialMaterials  (TIMs).    The  presence  of  local  activities  associated  withmanufacturing, mining, or agriculture can present both DNBI (incidentaland accidental releases) and BI (enemy action) threats.  Efforts should bemade in site selection to minimize the risk of TICs/TIMs by optimizinglocations,  but  often  tactics  and  expediency  dictate  the  use  of  a  locationwhere significant risk/threat still exists.3.4.3.1.3.  Ongoing Operations (Pollution).  Ongoing manufacturing andmining  produces  emissions  and  effluents.    The  effects  of  airbornecontamination  are  difficult  to  counter,  but  the  effects  should  beconsidered.    Countermeasures  should  be  developed  for  water  and  soilcontamination.3.4.3.1.4.  Past Operations (Pollution).  For rapid deployments, locationsof opportunity are often used.  These frequently include existing airfields,both  commercial  airports  and  host  nation/seized  bases.    Commercialairports are often in industrial areas with the land occupied by our forcesadjacent  to  the  airport.    The  activities  and  practices  of  both  airfieldoperations  or  past  industrial  operations  may  have  contaminated  the  site.This  should  be  researched  before  deployment,  to  optimize  site  selectionand to serve as the basis for a pre-deployment countermeasures plan.3.4.3.1.5.    Catastrophic  Event.    Catastrophic  release  of  TICs/TIMs  orCBRN agents can be either accidental or a result of enemy action.  Theworst-case scenarios for either are usually equivalent.  Given intelligenceon local manufacturing or TIC/TIM storage/distribution, estimates of theeffect of such a release can and should be modeled prior to deployment.In addition to the sources listed for estimating the threat presented by theambient  environment,  research  any  site  surveys,  historical  or  NationalImagery  and  Mapping  Agency  images,  and  work  with  wing  AFOSI  toaccess other intelligence sources.3.5.    Deploying  Mission  Support  and  Flight  Operations  (Occupational  Health).Many operations that are conducted while in garrison are similar to those accomplishedin a deployed setting, although there may be differences in facilities, operations tempo,and  other  parameters  that  would  impact  the  overall  exposure  and  risk.    Effective  riskAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200419management  strategies  for  deployed  operations  should  be  developed  during  routine,  ingarrison ORM, accounting for potential differences between each working environment.3.5.1.  Deployed Equipment and Materials.  Based on the equipment and materialson the UTC of an organization, expected hazards can be identified and assessed.  Ifadministrative  controls  are  necessary, thesupervisor/commander for inclusion in training and guidance.  If Personal ProtectiveEquipment  (PPE)  is  expected  to  be  required  for  deployed  operations,  it  should  beincluded in the appropriate UTC allowance.  Supervisors/commanders in consultationwith BE personnel should consider the unique exposure circumstances presented byworking  with/handling  deployed  equipment  and  materials  of  host-nation  origin.These  considerations  should  include  high  asbestos  and  other  TIC/TIM  content  ofcommonly used terms, which may prompt worker requirements for additional PPE.should  be  provided this to 3.5.2.    Facilities  and  Engineering  Controls.    Activities  normally  conducted  in  adedicated  facility  may  be  performed  on  the  flightline  or  in  a  common  use  hangarwhen deployed.  Additionally, engineering controls available in garrison will likelybe unavailable in deployed location.  These factors may drive the need to use PPE fordeployed  operations  when  none  are  necessary  in  garrison.    This  need  may  driveequipment, training, and medical monitoring not required in garrison operations.3.6.  Risk Communication.  Risk communication involves communication essential tocasualty  prevention,  and  the  pre-deployment  phase  is  a  prime  opportunity  to  uncoverpotential  threats  and  vulnerabilities  to  the  force  and  suggest  preventive  solutions.  TheHSS community must communicate these potential risks to commanders, supervisors andpersonnel pending deployment as well as to outside agencies such as the media.3.6.1.  Subject Matter Experts.  In all cases, the risk communicator should be thesubject  matter  expert  for  transmission  of  threat,  vulnerabilities  and  recommendedsolutions.3.6.2.    Risk  Communication  Plan.    For  large  scale  events,  develop  a  riskcommunication plan.  The risk communication transmission will provide threat andvulnerabilities information and recommend solutions.  The plan should be exercisedas necessary.3.6.3.    Pre-Exposure  Preparation  (PEP)  Training.    PEP  training  is  a  preventiveapproach to help individuals prepare for and cope with potentially traumatic events. Itis useful for anyone facing  exposure  to  a  potentially  traumatic  event  and  promotesoptimal  performance.  First  responders  should  attempt  to  get  this  training  prior  toexposure to a traumatic event.  This training can be just-in-time training but will beincluded  as  a  separate  pre-deployment  briefing  IAW  AFI  44-153,  Critical  IncidentStress  Management,  attachment  8,  whenever  other  pre-deployment  briefings  areprovided.3.6.3.1.    PEP  training  emphasizes  the  normalcy  of  feeling  stress  in  abnormalsituations.    Training  focuses  on  practice  of  effective  approaches  to  stressAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200420management  and  the  avoidance  of  ineffective  approaches.  The  training,provided by the Critical Incident Stress Team, is conducted when exposure topotentially  traumatic  events  is  expected  (e.g.,  body  retrieval,  or  a  significantdisaster  with  loss  of  life).  Material  for  conducting  pre-exposure  preparationtraining is contained in AFI 44-153.3.6.3.2. PEP training can also be used to prepare an entire community when apotentially  traumatic  event,  such  as  a  mobilization  deployment,  can  bepredicted.3.6.3.3.    When  PEP  training  is  not  possible  and  when  a  potentially  traumaticevent has occurred, individuals not directly involved in the event can be givengeneral educational meetings alerting them of the normal reactions to trauma.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200421Chapter 4DEPLOYMENT4.1.  Overview.  Casualty prevention is an ongoing activity during all phases of militaryoperations.  In this section, specific casualty prevention steps are given during five phasesof deployment—open the airbase, establish the airbase, operate the airbase, sustainment,and base closure.4.2.    Key  Personnel.    IDMTs,  Squadron  Medical  Elements  (SMEs),  PAM  teams,  andMGRL  teams  are  the  primary  actors  during  deployment.    PAM  and  MGRL  teams  arespecifically  intended  to  identify,  monitor  and  prevent  DNBI.    PAM  and  MGRL  teamsdiffer in regards to operational control, staffing, and duration; operationally, they are notinterchangeable.  The geographic combatant commander has operational control of PAMteams.  MGRLs remain under the operational control of the United States TransportationCommand USTRANSCOM commander.Figure 4.1.

Open the Airbase (Site/Airfield Survey).  Environmental threats to forces are theprimary concerns during this phase of deployment.  The task of opening the base beginswith the site or airfield survey.  The survey consists of two phases—Phase I, Initial SiteAssessment and Phase II, Site Layout.  Phase I is a reconnaissance mission to determinesite suitability/feasibility.  Phase II, Site layout, or bed-down (open the base), planningoccurs after the site has already been chosen for a particular mission. (See Figure 4.1).4.3.1.  Phase 1-Initial Site Surveys.  Normally, COMAFFORs organize and conductinitial site surveys.  HSS personnel can and should access the latest site survey bycontacting  the  geographic  combatant  command  AFFOR/SG  representative  and  theUSTRANSCOM AFFOR/SG. The timing and scope of site surveys depends on worldAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200422circumstances.    In  the  deliberate  planning  mode,  COMAFFORs  conduct  andperiodically update site surveys.  In the Crisis Action mode, the site survey may occursimultaneously  with  deployment.    Team  composition  depends  on  the  amount  ofinformation/intelligence that is currently available for the site.   HSS has key roles inthe threat and beddown assessments. Normally, AMS, PH and BE personnel possessthe best skill sets for health and environmental threat and beddown assessments andserve  as  the  HSS  members  on  these  teams.    The  following  list  details  the  fourfunctions of the initial survey, and the corresponding subject matter experts and teammembers.4.3.1.1.  Pavements Evaluation – CE.4.3.1.2.  Airfield Suitability Survey – Airfield Operations.4.3.1.3.  Threat  Assessment  –  Security  Forces,  HSS,  and  AFOSI.    HSSrepresentative  conducts  an  initial  area  health  threat  assessment  for  endemicdisease,  and  initial  assessments  of  local  food  and  water  sources.    Threatassessments also include evaluation of local industries to determine the hazardsassociated with a release of TICs/TIMs during deliberate targeting or collateraldamage.    Host  nation  industrial  hazards  can  present  serious  danger  to  U.S.forces  if  their  infrastructure  is  damaged—either  by  deliberate  targeting  orcollateral damage.  They can also pose a less immediate danger if the base isdownwind or downstream.4.3.1.4.   Beddown  Assessment  –  CE,  Contracting,  Petroleum  Oil  andLubricants, Munitions/Safety Communications, Logistics Plans, and HSS. TheHSS Beddown assessment must address the following:4.3.1.4.1.  Adequacy and Potability of Available Water Sources.  Usethe  water  consumption  planning  factors  from  Air  Combat  CommandField Manual 00-1 “Bioenvironmental Engineering Environmental FieldManual” to determine the adequacy of available sources.  If possible, thesurvey team should collect source water samples to determine potability.HSS personnel should also assess sources of pollution that could impactwater  sources—particularly  during  a  rainy  season—such  as,  landfills,agriculture/livestock activities, and industrial and sewage discharge.4.3.1.4.2.    Drainage  and  Geology.    HSS  team  members  shoulddetermine if the proposed site is in a flood plain, a natural drainage basinor  an  area  with  a  high  water  table.  To  facilitate  camp  drainage  andsoakage  pits,  the  site  should  support  good  percolation.    In  addition,check for large quantities of rock, which will make it more difficult todig  latrines,  drainage  pits  and  interment  sites.    Subsoil  that  consistslargely of clay or sand will not provide stable building platforms.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004234.3.1.4.3.    Environmental  Health  Site  Assessment.    The  HSS  teammembers should perform as much of the “reconnaissance and interview”step as possible during the initial site survey.  The team should identify“areas  of  concern”  where  exposure  scenarios  are  likely,  such  as  whenthere  are  hazardous/radiological  waste  burial  sites,  mine  tailings,  andsoil/ground water plumes.  This information is part of the “preliminaryhazard assessment.”4.3.1.4.4.    Sewage/Waste  Disposal.    The  team  should  note  theavailability,  capacity  and  condition  of  any  available  sewage/wastedisposal systems.4.3.1.4.5.   Local  Health  Service  Support  Capabilities.  Assesscapabilities  of  local  PH,  mental  health  and  medical  care  facilities  (aswell  as  other  services  in  the  area)  for  availability,  accessibility  andstandards of care practiced.4.3.1.4.6.    Food  Source  Approval.    When  food  sources  must  beprocured  locally  at  the  deployed  location,  contracting  in  coordinationwith  services  and  Public  Health  will  help  ensure  only  approved  foodsources are procured/consumed.4.3.1.5.  Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) Capabilities.  Determine the ability toaccess tertiary health care in a timely manner, and return injured personnel toduty.      Early  mobilization  of  AE  assets  will  improve  casualty  prognosis.Consider  distance  from  tertiary  facility  and  time  required  for  AE  to  delivercasualty  under  urgent  conditions.    Critical  Care  Aeromedical  Transport  Teamsupport will also factor into AE considerations.  Also consider airfield/landingstrip capabilities (fixed wing vs. rotary wing support) and availability of MobileAeromedical Staging Facility capabilities.  Also consider the AE transport needsof  contaminated  and  infectious  patients.    (See  AFTTP  3-42.5,  AeromedicalEvacuation.)4.3.2.  Phase 2-Site Layout/Advance Team (ADVON).   The second phase of  thesite survey is usually conducted by a  wing or weapon system ADVON team.  Thesurvey is for the purpose of bedding down  a particular mission or  group of forces.The beddown plan,  which  includes  site  layout,  is  the  primary  product  of  this  phase.HSS has a vital role in this phase since site layout can have a tremendous impact onhuman  health  and  performance.    The  team  should  continue  conducting  the  EHSA,along  with  infectious  disease  and  sanitation  evaluation  to  advise  base  planners  andensure site layout minimizes the number and severity of potential exposure pathways.Casualty prevention  efforts  for the  ADVON team include, but  are not limited to thefollowing:4.3.2.1.  Water Source Selection and Treatment Requirements.  To assist insource  selection  and  treatment  requirements,  HSS  personnel  (normally  BE)AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200424should  perform  initial  screening  using  available  field  equipment.    Referenceinterim  AFMAN  48-138  “Sanitary  Control  and  Surveillance  of  Field  WaterSupplies” for procedures and maximum contaminant limits.4.3.2.2.  TICs/TIMs.  Location of local industrial facilities and any associatedair  emission  plumes  may  affect  base  personnel  in  their  work  or  livingenvironments.  Information on prevailing wind patterns will help determine thebest locations for work, dining and living site layout planning.  Also considerlocations of base and local nation Hazardous Material (HAZMAT) storage sites,hazardous  waste  and  solid  waste  disposal  sites  and  other  landfill  sites  whenplanning work, living or dining facilities.  As the mission allows, PAM/MGRLteam members should develop the sampling plan, and collect vital samples toassess potential  exposure locations.4.3.2.3.    Billeting  And  Dining  Facilities.    HSS  personnel  should  ensurebilleting  and  dining  facilities  are  an  appropriate  distance  from  lavatories,standing  bodies  of  water  and  other  hazards,  such  as  camp  boundaries,  andflightline  noise  hazards.    HSS  personnel  should  also  ensure  there  are  anappropriate  number  of  lavatories  and  hand  washing  units  per  capita,  and  thathand  washing  facilities  are  immediately  accessible  at  lavatories  and  diningfacilities.    They  should  also  conduct  site  surveys  to  ensure  conditions  areappropriate for food storage, and assist CE in designing gray water storage andtreatment,  and  septic  disposal.    HSS  should  influence  site  layout  to  createbilleting  areas  conducive  to  good  rest.    Consider  noise  and  traffic  flow  andgroup workers by shifts to minimize interruptions.4.3.2.4.    Siting  Medicine  Facilities.    Ensuring  ease  of  access  and  increasedavailability  enhances  the  probability  that  individuals  will  seek  care  whenappropriate.    In  determining  the  location  of  MTFs  consider  the  proximity  toprimary targets.  MTFs should be close enough to work and billeting areas to beeasily  accessed,  but  distanced  to  adequately  provide  noncombatant  safety.Consider  the  potential  impact  of  hazardous  noise  exposure  and  speechinterference  levels  which  might  interfere  with  health  care  delivery.    Thereshould be an efficient and safe casualty collection/flow across NBC and defensesectors.    A  plan  to  include  tactical  communication  support  or  have  it  locatednearby will be necessary.4.3.2.5.    Mortuary  Facilities.      In  coordination  with  services  personnel,PAM/MGRL personnel assist in siting mortuary facilities.  In addition, the NBCMDO must assist in developing procedures for the temporary interment of thedeceased  contaminated  with  NBC  agents,  and  physicians  must  help  developprocedures for death certificate completion in these circumstances.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200425Figure 4.2.

Medical  Intelligence  coordinates  with  FlightMedicine,  BE,  AFOSI,  Wing  Intelligence  Officer,  AFMIC  and  Higher  HQ’spersonnel  to  identify  new  or  changing  threats  and  recommend  Force  Protectioninterventions.  Every effort should be made to include all sources of intelligence,both  operational  and  medical.    The  MIO  should  routinely  brief  commanders  anddeployed personnel on changes.4.4.2.  Establishing Safe Water and Food Supplies.4.4.2.1.    Water  Distribution  Systems.    BE  personnel  must  assist  CE  indetermining  the  treatment  requirements  and  assisting  in  distribution  systemdesign.4.4.2.1.1.    After  drinking  water  treatment  is  in  place,  BE  personnelmust  certify  the  “finished”  water  for  consumption.    Finished  watermust comply  with  the  maximum  contaminant  levels  in  AFMAN  48-138.    Normally,  these  standards  will  be  more  stringent  than  thosepublished  in  the  host  nation  Final  Governing  Standards  (FGSs),  butBE should verify this fact, and strive for compliance with any FGSs.BE personnel may use available field techniques for chemicals, and apresence/absence    test  for  biological  contamination  to  make  initialwater  quality/potability  determinations.  However,  they  must  submitadditional  samples  to  an  approved  analytical  laboratory  for  eventualverification,  and  document  the  laboratory  results  in  GEMs.  BEAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200426personnel must also report water monitoring results in accordance withthe AFFOR/SG directions.4.4.2.1.2.   CE personnel must sanitize water storage tanks, trucks andbuffaloes  before  placing  them  in  operation.    Reference  Air  CombatCommand  Field  Manual  00-1,  Bioenvironmental  EngineeringEnvironmental  Field  Manual  for  sanitization  procedures.   BEpersonnel should verify adequacy of sanitation. 4.4.2.1.3.  Throughout the selection and design process, BE personnelshould consider the vulnerability of the water  system  components  tonatural disaster, sabotage/terrorism and conventional attack.  As soonas possible, BE personnel conduct a Water Vulnerability Assessment(WVA) of the entire system using the Air Force Institute OccupationalHealth (AFIOH) “Water Vulnerability and Risk Assessments for DODPotable Water Assets” [draft] Aug 02.   BE personnel will report theresults  of  the  WVA  to  the  installation  force  protection  workinggroup/security  council.    The  Installation  Security  Council  shoulddesign  and  implement  measures  to  reduce  identified  vulnerabilities,and track the status of vulnerabilities, periodically.4.4.2.2.  Bottled Water. Contracting must not locally purchase bottled waterunless  the  bottled  water  is  on  the  DOD  Directory  of  Approved  Sourcesmaintained by the Army Veterinary Services.  If no locally approved source isavailable,  an  approval  inspection  of  the  production/bottling  facility  isaccomplished.    If  an  approval  inspection  is  necessary,  HSS  personnel  willconsult the AFFOR/SG staff, using the appropriate chain of command.  TheAFFOR/SG staff will coordinate the inspection with embassy officials, usingthe  appropriate  chain  of  command,  so  embassy  officials  can  ensurecompliance with international agreements.  If the AFFOR/SG instructs localBE  personnel  to  perform  the  inspection,  they  should  use  Military  Standard3006,  Sanitation  Requirements  for  Food  Establishments  (Army  CentralCommand), and test the bottled water prior to consumption.  AFMAN 48-138,Field  Water  Surveillance  contains testing  procedures  and  maximumcontaminant limits for bottled water.4.4.2.3.    Food  Procurement.    PH  personnel  should  work  with  the  BaseContracting  officer  and  US  Army  Veterinary  services  (when  available)  toinspect  and  approve  local  sources  for  procurement  of  food.    If  US  ArmyVeterinary  services  cannot  perform  local  approval  inspection  for  a  foodsource,  Air  Force  PH  will  perform  local  approved  source  inspections  andmaintain  a  local  approved  source  listing.    Routine  surveillance  of  thesesources will be conducted to ensure a continuous supply of safe food products.4.4.2.4.    Food  Vulnerability.    PH  personnel  should  assess  the  threat  ofintentional  contamination  to  the  food  supply  using  available  intelligenceAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200427sources (i.e., AFOSI data, SIPRNET).  These assessments should be part of afocused  analysis  of  the  installation’s  vulnerability  and  potential  mitigationmeasures.  Food surveillance should be enhanced with any increased threat.Food  vulnerability  assessments  should  be  coordinated  with  other  applicableagencies (services) and updated/reviewed as needed by the force protection-working group.  Specifically, Services Agency (SVA) will apply OperationalRisk  Management  (ORM)  techniques  to  determine  the  acceptability  ofcontracting/hiring host-nation (local) workers to serve as food handlers for theinstallation.    In  such  cases  where  the  decision  includes  hiring  local  foodhandlers,  SVA  will  coordinate  with  SFS  and  AFOSI  on  conductingbackground  security  checks  before  such  individuals  are  hired  and  will  alsocoordinate with Public Health on food handler training.4.4.3.    Disease  Surveillance.    Collect  baseline  and  ongoing  disease  surveillancedata  to  establish  disease  surveillance  to  identify  covert  biological  attacks  orendemic  disease  outbreaks.    Part  of  baseline  data  includes  maintenance  of  list  ofdeployed  personnel  to  determine  rates  of  disease  and  illness.    Report  DNBI  asoutlined  in  Enclosure  C  of  the  JCS  Memo,  1  Feb  02,  “Updated  Procedures  forDeployment  Health  Surveillance  and  Readiness.”    PH  personnel  will  ensurereportable medical events (Enclosure D, JCS Memo, 1 Feb 02) are reported and willconduct  epidemiological  investigations  IAW  Air  Force  guidance  and  clinicalindications.  PH personnel will coordinate with local health authorities to determinelocal  disease  patterns  and  outbreaks.    Intercession  strategies  will  be  targetedaccording to the disease patterns and outbreak information taken as a whole fromboth  DOD  and  local  data.    PH  will  forward  information  gathered  about  diseasepatterns and outbreaks through channels to AFMIC (so others deploying to this areaare aware of updated medical intelligence).4.4.4.  Planning.4.4.4.1.    NBC  Defense  Planning.    During  this  phase  of  deployment,  NBCMDOs  should  coordinate  with  CEX  personnel  to  establish  the  NBCreconnaissance and detection plan, and evaluate the impact of NBC sectors tocasualty collection and transport.  They should also coordinate with CEX onproposed contamination control area  sites.  (See AFTTP 3-42.3, HSS in NBCEnvironments  and  AFMAN  10-2602,  Nuclear,  Biological,  Chemical,  andConventional  Defense Operations and Standards for additional information.)4.4.4.2.    Disaster  Response  Planning.    PAM/MGRL  personnel  mustcooperate  with  Security  Forces,  CEX  and  CEF  personnel  to  develop  HSSannexes for base  response plans, including the base Disaster  Response  Planand the Base Support plan.   In addition to the considerations listed in AFI 10-2501, Full Spectrum Threat Response, PAM/MGRL personnel should plan forestablishing  quarantine  protocols  and  areas  in  the  event  of  an  infectiousdisease episode, and caring for civilians, prisoners of war, and/or refugees.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004284.4.5.    Continue  EHSA.        PAM/MGRL  personnel  should  update  the  EHSAsampling plan begun in the site layout  phase,  and  collect  samples  as  the  missionallows.  Prioritize sampling on the basis of risk.4.4.5.1.    Morale,  Welfare  and  Recreation.    PAM/MGRL  personnel  assessthe health risk of offsite establishments (normally PH) and swimming  areas(normally BE).  These subject matter experts will advise the deployed servicessquadron and Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board.4.4.5.2.  Define Operational Activities and Exposure Groups.  The healththreat from force activities becomes an emphasis during this phase.  To beginassessing and controlling this risk, PAM/MGRL personnel should conduct a“walk  through”  to  identify,  inventory  and  classify  operational  activities  andexposure  groups.    Exposure  groups  consist  of  individuals  who  will  receivesimilar  operational  and  environmental  exposures  during  the  course  of  theirduties.  Activities are operational tasks and processes.  Normally, individualsin an exposure group perform the same operational tasks and processes.  PAMpersonnel  will  enter  this  inventory  into  the  Theater  Occupational  Model(TOMs) module of GEMS.  PAM/MGRL personnel will categorize exposuregroups by risk and prioritize them for exposure assessment.4.4.5.3.    Hazardous  Material  Management  and  Disposal.    In  somesituations,  hazardous  materials  may  be  procured  locally  at  the  deployedlocation.  In these situations, BE personnel must work closely with contractingpersonnel to purchase materials with the lowest degree of associated risk.  Ifhazardous  materials  must  be  obtained,  the  supplier  should  provide  the  AirForce with the constituents of the product at a minimum.   Though  AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous  Materials  Management  Program,  is  intended  for  “ingarrison” use, it can serve as a useful guide for ensuring safe management anddistribution of hazardous materials in deployed settings.  The environmentaland  occupational  health  assessment  process,  described  in  the  “operate  thebase”  section  of  this  chapter  includes  evaluation  procedures  for  hazardousmaterial  use.    BE  personnel  must  also  work  with  CE  personnel  to  ensurepotentially hazardous waste is stored safely, and disposal will not adverselyimpact environment.4.4.5.4.  Accessing Local Medical Care.  Establish cooperative local careagreements,  communications,  surveillance  standards,  terms  for  health  careassistance and reimbursement as appropriate, and then maintain liaison withthese providers.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200429Figure 4.3.

Many of the functions initiated during the beddown period will be maintainedthroughout this phase.  (See Figure 4.3.)4.5.1.    Facility  Sanitation.    PH  personnel  will  conduct  routine  surveillance  of  allfood  facilities  on  base  to  prevent  food  borne  illness  disease  and  outbreaks.    Allaspects of food safety/security, from the receipt of food to serving of meals, should beevaluated.    Adherence  to  the  United  States  Food  and  Drug  Administration  FoodCode,  food  handler  training,  and  food  storage  and  facility  sanitation  should  bemonitored and findings entered in the GEMS database.4.5.2.  Environmental and Occupational Health Assessment.4.5.2.1.  Occupational  Health.  BE  personnel  will  evaluate  the  health  threatsassociated with force activities and provide commanders appropriate mitigativestrategies  to  minimize  risk.    Though  AFMAN  48-145,  Occupational  HealthProgram  is  directed  at  “in  garrison”  occupational  health  surveillance,  its  riskAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200430assessment process is applicable to deployed settings as well.   BE  personnelshould adhere to AFMAN 48-145 as closely as possible.4.5.2.1.1.  After completing initial health risk assessments, BE personnelshould establish a process to routinely review the currency of the healthrisk assessment.  Factors which may change the risk assessment includechanges  in  force  conditions,  changes  in  vulnerability  to  attack  orsabotage,  change  in  mission  or  weapon  system,  significant  changes  tooperations,  and to  Air  and  SpaceExpeditionary Force (AEF) rotations.turn-over  of  personnel  due 4.5.2.1.2.  Due to turnover of personnel during AEF rotations, if missionallows,  routine  surveillance  of  category  1  and  2  workplaces  (asidentified  in  AFI  48-145,  Occupational  Health  Program)  should  beconducted during each rotation.  Emphasis should be placed on ensuringconditions  are  the  same  as  during  the  previous  AEF  rotation.    Whenpossible, this should be done toward the beginning of the rotation.4.5.2.1.3.    Maintenance  of  accurate  similar  exposure  group  personnelrosters is essential for ensuring occupational, environmental, and healthsurveillance  exposure  data  can  be  linked  to  each  individual’s  medicalrecord as required by DOD/Health Affairs policy as delineated in DODI6490.3.4.5.2.2.    Environmental  Health.    The  health  risk  assessment  process  alsoapplies  to  the  interpretation  of  EHSA  and  other  environmental  data.    BEpersonnel should continue to execute the EHSA and update the conceptual sitemodel as the mission allows.  Prioritize sample collection on the basis of risk.4.5.2.3.   Data Management.  GEMS will be used for data management.  SeeChapter  6  for  more  details.   Both  acute  and  chronic  health  risk  informationshould  be  entered  into  GEMS.    GEMS  enables  the  AFMS  to  meet  therequirements  in  Presidential  Review  Directive  5  to  establish  a  longitudinalhealth  record  that  includes  environmental  and  occupational  health  exposures. All  environmental  and  occupational  health  exposures  must  be  tied  to  anindividual. 4.5.3.  Available Standards and Guidance.   AFI  48-145,  Occupational  Health  Program 4.5.3.1. the  primaryoccupational  health  surveillance  guidance.    Much  professional  judgment  isrequired  to  determine  applicable  occupational  and  environmental  healthstandards  and  guidelines.    Army  Technical  Guide  230,  Chemical  ExposureGuidelines for Deployed Military Personnel, should be used as a reference foroccupational and environmental exposure with the following exceptions:is AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004314.5.3.1.1.    Do  NOT  use  the  chemical  agent  warfare  exposurestandards; instead use the values posted in AFMAN 10-2602, NuclearBiological,  Chemical  and  Conventional  Defense  Operations  andStandards, and the procedures established in Chemical Warfare AgentHealth  Risk  Assessment  interim  guidance  published  by  AFMOA  forassessing health risk.4.5.3.1.2.  Do NOT use the drinking water guidance; instead use draftAFMAN  48-138,  Sanitary  Control  and  Surveillance  of  Field  WaterSupplies.4.5.3.2.   The  Overseas  Environmental  Baseline  Guidance  Document(OEBGD) and  FGS usually  do  not  apply  to  deployment  locations,  althoughthey may if forces are deployed at a fixed location.  The OEBGD and FGS canbe used as a guide, as operations allow.  Questions on applicability of thesedocuments should be referred to the AFFOR/SG.4.5.3.3.    Other  sources  of  occupational  and  environmental  health  standardsmay be used if Army TG 230, Chemical Exposure Guidelines for DeployedMilitary  Personnel  does  not  address  them.    These  include  occupationalexposure guidelines established by Air Force Occupational Safety and Health(AFOSH) Standard 48-8.   A great deal of professional judgment is requiredwhen applying these guidelines, and BE personnel must ensure they take intoaccount operational needs when using them.4.5.4.  Monitoring and Sampling Plans/Procedures.4.5.4.1.    BE  personnel  shall  establish  monitoring  and  sampling  plans  andprocedures for environmental and occupational health surveillance.4.5.4.2.    For  drinking  water,  a  routine  surveillance  schedule  should  beestablished based on ORM principles, and AFMAN 48-138.4.5.4.3.    When  sending  samples  to  other  laboratories,  ensure  a  chain  ofcustody is established for the samples.  If the AFFOR/SG has not establishedprocedures, use DD Form 1911, Materiel Courier Receipt.4.5.5.    Epidemiological  Surveillance.    PH  personnel  will  conduct  disease  andsyndromic  surveillance  on  a  daily  basis.    An  effective  tool  for  identifying  andtargeting  health  hazards  is  a  robust  health  surveillance  and  Disease  Non-BattleInjuries (DNBI) monitoring and  reporting system.   PH  personnel  will  educate  allproviders on the importance of compliance with the theater surveillance system andensuring accurate patient encounter information.4.5.6.

In addition to the training listedabove,  encourage  personnel  to  apply  ORM  to  activities—both  duty-relatedand  recreational.    Determination  of  injury  risk  requires  individual  riskassessment.  Personnel should consider pre-existing injuries, activity risk, andfamiliarity  with  the  activities.    Provide  personnel  information  about  fatigueand stress mitigation, and train them to consider these factors.4.5.8.  Flight Medicine Issues.4.5.8.1.  Crew Rest.  In coordination with the Operations Group Commander(or  equivalent),  establish  requirements  and  restrictions  and    monitor  forimplementation and adherence to requirements.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004334.5.8.2.

The  Fatigue  AvoidanceScheduling  Tool  is  useful  to  monitor  operational  use  of  counter-fatiguemedication (go/no-go pills) administration and usage.  The AFFOR/SG willlikely have specific reporting requirements for go/no-go pill reporting.  Flightmedicine personnel work with commanders to develop work/rest cycles andcrew rest requirements.4.5.9.    Detachment  Oversight.    Monitor  detachment  IDMT  status  as  indicated.Conduct  detachment  site  visits  with  appropriate  frequency  to  ensure  training  andoversight of medical care provided by IDMTs.4.5.10.  Reachback Support.4.5.10.1.  The  AFFOR/SG  will  act  as  the  focal  point  for  reachback  support,and can provide (or arrange for) technical consultation as well.4.5.10.2.  If a theater laboratory is established, BE personnel should becomeaware  of  the  laboratory’s  capabilities  and  use  the  laboratory  when  localanalysis  is  not  possible,  or  additional  analysis  is  required.    The  laboratoryshould  also  be  used  for  technical  consultation  on  conducting  health  riskassessments beyond the scope of installation preventive medicine personnel.4.5.10.3.  If a theater laboratory is not available, the AFFOR/SG will establishprocedures for using service level organizations such as AFIOH or US ArmyCenter for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (USACHPPM).  Theseorganizations can also provide technical consultation, and may  be  called  onfor focused health risk assessments. 4.6.  Sustainment.4.6.1.  Ongoing Activities.4.6.1.1.    Team  Aerospace  personnel  should  continue  to  routinely  review  thecurrency of both the occupational and environmental health risk assessments, asdescribed in paragraph 4.5.2.1.1. and 4.5.4.1 above.  DNBI indicators could alsoinitiate additional sampling.4.6.1.2.    For  drinking  water,  a  routine  surveillance  schedule  should  beestablished to include random sampling, as an effort to defeat sabotage.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004344.6.1.3.  For air and surface water, (seasonal changes, etc.), enough data shouldbe collected to ensure seasonal variations are accounted for.  Once a baseline isestablished,  additional  sampling  is  not  required  unless  significant  changesoccur.4.6.1.4.  For soil, there is no need to conduct routine surveillance unless thereare  significant  events  such  as  hazardous  material  spills,  discovery  of  buriedwaste, etc., or other indications.4.6.2.  Data Management.  For most units, GEMS will be used for data management.4.6.3.    Hazardous  Material  Management.    During  the  sustainment  phase,  thedeployed installation may establish a hazardous material management process.  Seereference AFI 32-7086, Hazardous Material Management for more details on the roleof BE personnel in this process.4.6.4.  Life Skills Support Center.4.6.4.1.    Establishment  of  Life  Skills  Support  Center  (LSSC).    Theestablishment of the LSSC should be part of risk communication efforts.   Theteam  will  rapidly  deploy  and  set  up  within  24  hours  after  arrival.    The  teamchief  will  meet  with  the  DMC  upon  arrival  at  the  deployed  location  andcoordinate an initial meeting (within the first week) with Wing commander viathe DMC.  The team will begin their initial assessment after setup is complete todetermine  the  needs  of  the  deployed  location  and  provide  this  assessmentinformation to the leadership.  The Life Skills team will serve as a consultant tothe  Wing  and  Medical  Group  commanders  on  the  emotional  readiness  of  thedeployed forces.  The team will provide a variety of outreach  and  preventionservices, and early detection and intervention services.4.6.4.2.  Family Support Issues.  Recognition of the importance of family orpersonal  stressors  and  their  effect  on  individual  performance  and  safety  isparamount.    Early  recognition  of  these  factors  may  be  key  in  limiting  theireffects.  Prevention begins prior to deployment (see Chapter 3) but ongoing careof  family  and  individuals’  needs  should  be  supported  throughout  thedeployment.4.6.4.3.  Critical Incident Stress Management.  Many types of events have thepotential to produce individual and community traumatic stress. It is Air Forcepolicy  to  provide  Critical  Incident  Stress  Management  (CISM)  preventiveservices to unit and community members whenever possible before potentiallytraumatic  events  occur.    Similarly,  CISM  services  will  be  provided  aftertraumatic events to help those who have experienced the events.  In each case,the goal is to assist those affected by traumatic events to cope with the normalstress reaction in an effective manner.  These actions are intended to minimizethe  impact  of  exposure  to  these  events  and  prevent  or  mitigate  permanentAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200435disability, if possible.  The deployed Wing commander is responsible to ensurethat CISM services are available to deployed personnel.4.6.5.  Food Laboratory Analysis.  PH will develop and refine a food monitoringand  testing  strategy.      Laboratory  personnel  should  ensure  chain  of  custodyprocedures for samples suspected to be from a BW incident.  Reports of suspectedBW  events  should  be  made  in  accordance  with  AFFOR  and  theater  reportingrequirements.4.7.  Base Closure/Redeployment.  As the base closure/redeployment plan is initiated, itis important for HSS to assess the effects of the base activities on the local environmentrelated to possible hazardous exposures and any other health risks identified during thedeployment.    Establish  continued  follow  up  liaison  between  HSS  and  local  healthcarecommunity.    Set  up  avenues  for  continued  cooperative  surveillance  and  reporting  ofinfectious diseases.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200436Chapter 5RE-DEPLOYMENT5.1.  Overview.  Casualty prevention continues to be an important consideration duringre-deployment.    Commanders  should  not  underestimate  the  significant  health  threatsassociated with redeployment.5.1.1.  Ongoing Activities at the Deployed Medical Element: The DMC needs tocontinue  the  ongoing  health  surveillance  program.    The  DMC  must  ensure  post-deployment  health  assessments  are  completed  by  all  deployers  prior  to  leaving  theAOR.    Instruction  on  required  follow  up  for  exposures  and  the  deployed  medicalrecord returns with the individual or unit.  Documentation of all exposures, medicalinterventions,  and  use  of  prophylaxis  or  antidotes  in  the  individual’s  deployedmedical  record  is  critical.  Use  of  the  GEMS  is  invaluable  to  maintaining  anexportable  automated  record  of  the  individual  and  collective  health  events.    Alldeployed  medical  encounter  documentation  should  be  printed  and  placed  in  thedeployed  medical  record  for  inclusion  in  the  patients  permanent  medical  record  athome station.5.1.2.  Completing the Post Deployment Health Assessment (DD Form 2796, PostDeployment Health Assessment Questionnaire).   5.1.2.1.  These assessments must be completed for all deployments that meet theJoint Chief of Staff (JCS) definition of a deployment.5.1.2.2.    At  the  deployed  location,  a  provider  (physician,  nurse  practitioner,physician  assistant,  or  IDMT)  administers  this  assessment  to  all  redeployingpersonnel  within  5  days  of  redeployment.  All  documentation  is  placed  in  thedeployed  medical  record  and  is  returned  to  home  station  by  the  redeployingmedical  element,  troop  commander  or  individual  member  in  the  event  themember does not return as part of a troop movement.  Regardless of how thedeployed  medical  record  returns  to  home  station,  it  is  critical  the  deployedmedical element makes sure it returns intact to the Force Health Managementelement of the PH section.5.1.3.    Continue  Surveillance  Efforts:  Up-channel  surveillance  data  to  the  DODcentral  data  repository  as  specified  in  Joint  Policy  Memorandum  on  DeployedOccupational Health and Environmental Health Surveillance. To the extent possible,surveillance activities, both environmental and epidemiological, should continue foras long as the potential exists to utilize the deployed location for future operations.5.1.4.    Redeployment  of  Equipment  and  Aircraft:  Redeploying  equipment  andaircraft  may  have  special  considerations,  depending  on  the  environment  where  theassets  were  used  or  transited.    Any  assets  used  in  locations  where  chemical,AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200437biological,  or  nuclear  weapons  (especially  dirty  bombs)  were  employed  by  theenemy,  will  need  to  be  decontaminated  before  they  are  redeployed.    Additionally,equipment or aircraft located in areas where there are indigenous infectious diseasesthat can be carried by equipment or aircraft  (to include pests/produce/plant diseases)will  also  need  to  be  decontaminated  before  they  are  redeployed.      The  AORcommander is the proper source for instructions for the redeployment of equipmentand aircraft.5.2.  Risk Communication.   The reconstitution phase of deployment is critical to thereunification  of  active  duty  members  with  their  families.    Reunion  briefings/classesshould be offered to the family of deployed members prior to their return and to deployedactive  duty  members  prior  to  their  return  home.    Upon  return  to  home  station,  thecouple/family should be offered a follow up reunion session along with any children inthe family (see “Communicating in a Crisis: Risk Communication Guidelines for PublicOfficials” [2002]),  U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Substance Abuse andMental MD[http://riskcommunication.samhsa.gov/index.htm.] for further information).Administration, Rockville, Health Services 5.3.    Critical  Incident  Stress  Management  (CISM).    The  deployed  Wing/CC  isresponsible  to  ensure  that  CISM  services  are  available  to  deployed  personnel  by  theLSSC  of  the  deployed  Medical  Group.  CISM  is  an  integrated  system  of  interventionsdesigned  to  prevent  and/or  mitigate  any  adverse  psychological  reaction  (i.e.  post-traumatic  stress  reactions).    The  goal  is  to  assist  those  affected  by  traumatic  events  tocope with the normal stress reaction in an effective manner.  These actions are intendedto minimize the impact of exposure to these events and prevent or mitigate permanentdisability  if  possible.    Moreover,  the  provision  of  these  important  services  assists  inmaking  a  smooth  transition  back  to  the  home  base  and  in  reinsertion  in  the  familyconstellation.  See chapter 4 for further details.5.4.    After  Action  Reports.  The  deployed  medical  element  (Expeditionary  MedicalSupport [EMEDS], SME, IDMT, etc.) must complete an after action report IAW AFI 41-106  Medical  Readiness  Planning  and  Training,  (Section  14.13.1)  within  30  days  ofcompleting  a  deployment  or  other  operations  (including  some  exercise/trainingoperations).    Reports  must  be  sent  to  the  respective  MAJCOM/SG  and  are  meant  tocapture the lessons learned for future operations.5.5.  Delayed Patient Identification.  Casualties can appear days, weeks, months evenyears after a deployment.  These casualties may be the result of previously unidentifiedhazards or be of unknown origin.  Medical providers will evaluate such patients using thetools  and  protocols  of  the  (DOD)  Post-Deployment  Health  Clinical  Practice  Guideline(PDH CPG).  This evaluation will be conducted by the presenting patient’s primary caremanager/team  and  should  be  documented  using  the  PDH  CPG  diagnostic  code.      If  acommunicable  disease  or  deployment  related  illness  is  suspected,  patients  should  bereferred to PH.  PH will conduct an initial investigation.  This investigation may includean interview with the patient, and an epidemiological analysis.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200438Chapter 6INFORMATION MANAGEMENT6.1.  Overview.  It is essential to be able to track and document illness and disease inorder  to  be  proactive  in  preventing  further  spread  and  future  outbreaks  of  disease.    Inaddition, a chronicle of exposures is necessary to assist in the detection and treatment offuture disease processes that may become chronic.  Global  Expeditionary  Medical  System. 6.2.   Overall,  GEMS  improves  thedocumentation  of  delivered  healthcare  and  response  to  health  threats  and/or  CBRNevents that place  our  forces  at  risk.  The  GEMS  reachback  capability  integrates  patientevaluation, epidemiological analysis, occupational/environmental exposures, and medicalcommand and control across the full spectrum of military medical operations and civilsupport  actions.    GEMS  improves,  the  documentation  of  the  healthcare  delivered  andresponse to threats and/or CBRN events that place our forces at risk.  The by-products area better continuity of patient care, improved surveillance of the deployed forces' health,and the direct reduction of illness and death through risk avoidance in the event of attackor  endemic  event.  The  GEMS  medical  information  system  is  a  full  spectrum  medicalmanagement system with the following system components:Figure 6.1.  The Global Expeditionary Medical SystemGEMS is a suite of tools to provide Air Force-wide medical force protection throughstandardized medical surveillance, analysis and Command and Control (C2).  GEMScomponents include:  - Patient Encounter Module (PEM) provides a standard electronic medical record forworldwide patient expeditionary surveillance and rearward connectivity.  - Theater Epidemiology Module (TEM) aggregates field medical data, monitorsdeployed troops for BW/epidemic events, and provides theater medical C2 capability.  - Algorithms produce disease epidemiology reports as indicators of potential BW attack.Personnel may modify these algorithms to meet local requirements.  - A Theater Occupational Module (TOM) designed to monitor and track complexendemic, environmental, occupational, and operational-related exposures in the deployedsetting.  - Force-wide, command-level, data analysis of deployed medical occurrences isarchived at Brooks City Base, Texas, and USACHPMM.6.3.    Patient  Encounter  Module.      The  PEM  is  a  paperless  linked  tool  for  front  linemedics  to  record  individual  patient  assessments.    The  system  works  from  a  handheldAFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200439device  in  mass  casualty  or  combat  environments.    The  information  collected  isaggregated  at  progressively  higher  levels  allowing  for  accurate  theater  assessment,epidemiologic monitoring and decision-making from the local to theater level.6.4.  Theater Occupational Module.  TOM does occupational and environmental healthsurveillance and offers continuous monitoring of deployed individuals and locations forarea  threats  and  condition.  The  users  can  conduct  Environmental  Health  SiteAssessments, Potable Water evaluations, and Industrial Hygiene surveillance. The TOMcreates  a  concise  data  set  for  the  GEMS  theater  database  with  an  integrated  forceprotection  capability.   Until  an  NBC  module  is  developed  and  fielded,  NBCenvironmental surveillance data should be entered into the existing TOM as appropriate.6.5.  Data Reporting and Repository.  USACHPPM maintains a central repository foroccupational and environmental health data.  The GEMS system will be used to transmitTOM  information  to  the  central  repository.    The  information  will  be  provided  to  theAFFOR/SG as well as the AFIOH.  AFIOH will analyze the data as described in interimpolicy  on  occupational  health  surveillance  published  by  AFMOA.    In  addition,  anysurvey  reports  should  be  provided  to  USACHPPM  according  to  DOD,  theater,  andAFFOR/SG procedures.6.6.    Public  Health  Deployed  (PHD).    PHD  documents  all  public  health  relatedinformation  and  exposures.    These  include:  Medical  Entomology,  Food  FacilityInspections, Public Facility Inspections, Food Storage and Procurement Inspections, andRation Inspections.6.7.  Theater Epidemiological Module.  The TEM uses the aggregated field patient datafrom  a  single  site  or  multiple  sites.    It  provides  both  summary  reports  and  graphicrepresentation of disease activity, rates and trends. The TEM generates the Disease Non-Battle Injury Report (DNBI) as well as other surveillance and medical care documents.  Italso tracks important command and control information including dispositions of ill andinjured  patients,  medical  facility  capability  and  PH  concerns  affecting  the  deployedpopulation. Using pre-defined disease and symptom complex information, the TEM actsto automatically monitor and alarm if rates exceed pre-defined thresholds.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 200440Chapter 7EDUCATION AND TRAINING7.1.  Introduction. The goal of education and training, formal or informal, is to impart aworking  knowledge  of  concepts,  principles,  and  procedures  for  casualty  preventionintervention. The education and training building blocks  for Air  Force  medical  servicepersonnel  begins  at  initial  training,  upon  entry  into  the  service,  and  continues  withperiodic refresher training throughout the lifecycle of the service member.  The pieces ofthe blocks can best be described in three phases:  initial training, sustainment training,and just-in-time training.  (See Figure 7.1)7.2.  Initial Training.  Initial training will occur at the accession/entry level course.  Forthe enlisted, these entry-level courses may include Basic Military Training at LacklandAFB, the Expeditionary Medical Readiness Course (EMRC) at Sheppard AFB, or BasicExpeditionary  Medical  Readiness  Training  at  Brooks  AFB.    Officers  receive  initialtraining by attending the Commissioned Officer Training/Reserve Commissioned OfficerTraining  course,  or  through  a  commissioning  program  such  as  a  Service  academy,Reserve Officer Training Corps, or Officer Training School, and technical school at theUSAF School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM) at Brooks AFB.   7.3. Sustainment Training.7.3.1.  Enlisted personnel enter into the sustainment training upon award of the 5-skilllevel.    Officers  enter  sustainment  training  after  completion  of  unit  orientationprogram and being awarded a fully qualified Air Force specialty code (AFSC).7.3.2.  AFSC sustainment training is designed to maintain medical skills of a fullyqualified member to adequately perform the duties required by the member’s AFSCin  a  deployed  setting.    All  personnel  assigned  to  a  UTC  must  participate  inappropriate  AFSC-specific  training.    The  Readiness  Skills  Verification  Program(RSVP) database is the source for AFSC specific sustainment training requirements.The  Wartime  Medical  Planning  System  Office,  www.warmedurl.af.mil,    is  theprimary guide for medical specialty-specific readiness training.7.3.3.  UTC sustainment training requirements are derived from the Mission EssentialTask  Lists  that  are  established  by  the  Manpower  and  Equipment  Force  Packagingowner  of  the  UTC.    MAJCOMs  may  provide  supplemental  guidance  for  medicalpersonnel to complete additional training based on readiness missions.7.3.4.    Sustainment  training  can  be  formal  in-resident  training  or  utilize  distance-learning  capabilities,  which  are  integral  in  reducing  temporary  duty  costs  and  timeaway from home station.AFTTP 3-42.2    20 April 2004417.4.  Just-In-Time (JIT) Training.   Although JIT training is a component of educationand training, it is not the optimal or desired method of training.  Therefore, JIT trainingshould  occur  just  prior  to  the  deployment  phase  (pre-deployment)  of  the  operation  orwhile deployed.  Just-in-time training is specific to the deployed location and situation.Figure 7.1.  Training Pyramid.Just-In-TimeUTCSpecificAFSC SpecificCore TrainingSustainmentTrainingInitial Training7.5.    Casualty  Prevention  Training.    AFI  41-106,  Medical  Readiness  Planning  andTraining  directs  specific  basic  training  requirements  for  medical  personnel.
