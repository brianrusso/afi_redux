This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job  training  for  4P0X1  personnel.    As  a  trainer,  the  QTPs  provide  teachable elements of task breakdowns.  The teachable elements will assist in guiding the trainee towards independent task performance, proficiency, and serve as an evaluation tool for trainers/certifiers.  2.    Review  the  volume(s)  of  the  Career  Development  Course  (s)  (CDC)  and  identify which module(s) of the QTP is needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.  The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area in which the trainee is working.  Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Job Qualification Standard (JQS)/Specialty Training Standard  (STS) marked with a 5 or 7 are core tasks for the 4P career field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.   3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any  task  or  QTP  evaluation.    Review  the  performance  checklist  and  training  objective with  the  trainee.    If  the  trainee  has  questions  about  the  objective,  clarify  the  desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion of the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task independently.    4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow the evaluation instructions.  The performance checklist must be used as you  evaluate  each  task  objective.    When  the  trainee  successfully  demonstrates  and accomplishes the objective, document the task completion appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record (AFTR).  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated in the trainee’s electronic training record.  NOTE:  The individual checklists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s user files.  6.    If  the  trainee  does  not  accomplish  the  objective,  review  the  areas  needing  further instruction.    Conduct  feedback  for  each  module  with  the  trainee,  and  document appropriately in the member’s Air Force Training Record.  As the trainer, once you are satisfied  the  trainee  is  ready  to  perform  the  task;  he/she  will  be  re-evaluated  until  the objective is met.  7.  If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently.  The trainee will then be evaluated by certifier/certifying official.  Tasks requiring certification are identified in column 2 of JQS with a number sign (#).  The certifier/certifying official will  ensure  documentation  in  column  3E  of  the  JQS.  The  certifier  will  ensure  that  a trainer’s signature is documented prior to signing off on the task in AFTR.   3 8.  Tasks associated with a QTP are identified in column 4D of the STS.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job position training.  Such standardization benefits the JQS training concept throughout a member’s career.  These documents may also be used in assessing/certifying pharmacy technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.  9.    Feedback  is  a  vital  and  important  part  of  improving  our  educational  process  for pharmacy  technicians.    Your  first  hand  expertise  is  valued  and  feedback  highly encouraged  ensuring  we  have  the  most  up-to-date  information  and  training  possible.   Please direct all inquiries to:  your immediate supervisor.                                      4  SUBJECT AREA:  Inpatient Pharmacy  TASK NAME(S):   Preparing Cytotoxic & Biological Agents  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(S):  6.2.2; 6.2.3; 6.2.4   EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:   1.

The trainee should be recertified on preparing chemotherapeutic admixtures annually.  5  OBJECTIVE:    1.  Given a provider’s order and the necessary equipment, safely prepare and transport chemotherapeutic admixtures and dispose of hazardous waste.  EVALUATION  INSTRUCTIONS:    In  evaluating  the  trainee’s  knowledge  and technique,  trainer  should  use  non-hazardous  medication  solutions  such  as  Fluorescein that will fluoresce under UV light.  OSHA recommends knowledge and competence of trainee be evaluated after the first training session and annually thereafter.    1.    After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task.  2.    Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished without assistance and without error.  3.    Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s AFTR record.  Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP.  All recurring evaluations should be documented on AF Form 1098.  STEPS IN TASK PERFORMANCE:  1.  Risk Of Exposure To Chemotherapeutic Medications Many medications used in the preparation of chemotherapeutic admixtures are cytotoxic (work  by  eliminating  existing  cancer  cells  but  can  also  harm  and  kill  healthy  cells), mutagenic  (cause  changes  in  the  reproductive  (DNA)  material  of  the  cell  resulting  in miscarriage,  and  birth  defects,  therefore  should  not  be  handled  if  pregnant)  or carcinogenic (cancer causing).  Some are also vesicants and irritants, causing skin rash, blistering,  or  discoloration.    They  must  be  handled  differently  from  less  hazardous medications  in  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  inadvertent  exposure  to  staff  and  patients through inhalation, absorption, ingestion, and accidental injection.    Risk of exposure from inhalation is greatest when drug particles enter the environment through aerosolization while being injected into a vial or parenteral solution, or when air from a drug-filled syringe is expelled.  This risk can be reduced by using the technique of maintaining negative pressure during injection and the use of a Biological Safety Cabinet or a respirator.    Risk of exposure from absorption may occur when the skin comes in contact with the medication through aerosolization, spraying, spills or touching a contaminated surface.  It is important to immediately wash the contaminated area to prevent prolonged exposure.  Additionally,  (should  not  have  ampules  for  chemotherapeutic  medications)  uncapped needles can also lead to exposure.  Use of proper technique in inserting and withdrawing needles  and  capping  and  uncapping  syringes  (to  reduce  potential  injury,  mishap,  and spills, Travis AFB has implemented the use of Vial and Syringe Adaptors).  Also, do not  6 soft contact preparing lenses  when wear chemotherapeutic  medications (chemotherapeutic  medications  should  not  be  prepared  outside  the  BSC).  These  lenses are permeable and may absorb medication particles or dust which can be absorbed into the body.  Risk of exposure from ingestion may occur when medication particles or droplets enter the  body  orally  by  way  of  food,  beverages,  etc.    Never  take  any  items  that  may  be ingested  into  areas  where  chemotherapy  medications  are  stored  or  prepared.  Hand washing is a must before and after any handling of cytotoxic agents to help prevent and reduce the risk of exposure from ingestion and absorption.    Risk of exposure from injection can occur if a contaminated needle or broken glass from an  ampule,  broken  vial  or  medication  container  accidentally  punctures  the  skin.    To prevent  this,  it  is  imperative  to  keep  the  needle  capped  when  not  in  use  or  use  of  the closed-system drug transfer devices - vial and syringe adaptors (if available).  Punctures can occur when capping and uncapping the needle and when opening ampules.  Be sure to always proceed slowly and cautiously during these procedures and even in handling of vials and medication containers.    2.  Reducing Risk Of Exposure To Chemotherapeutic Medications  OSHA  guidelines  for  the  safe  handling  of  hazardous  medications  require  the  use  of  a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (sometimes referred to as a vertical flow hood) and/or Class  III  Biological  Safety  Cabinet  (sometimes  referred  to  as  the  Laminar  Flow Glovebox/Isolator).    The Class II Biological Safety Cabinet or the vertical flow hood equipment provides a Class 100 clean-air workstation while providing some protection to the preparer and the work area from exposure to the product being prepared.  It also has a glass barrier that pulls down on the front for added protection.    The Class III Biological Safety Cabinet or the Laminar Flow Glovebox/Isolator (LFGI) equipment uses a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters to provide the highest level  of  operator  and  product  protection.    By  definition,  a  Class  III  BSC  is  a  totally enclosed ventilated cabinet of leak-tight construction.  The cabinet is maintained under negative air pressure and the supply air is drawn in through HEPA filters. The exhaust HEPA filter handles all air exiting the LFGI and all purged air that is purged inside the HEPA Purge airlock.  All filters are rated to remove particulates and aerosols 0.3 micron in size with a minimum efficiency of 99.99%.   The  Biological  Safety  Cabinet  should  be  certified  according  to  specification  of  the National  Sanitation  Foundation  Standard  49  and  Class  100  specifications  of  Federal Standard 209C before use.      7  to  remove immediately  after  a  spill the  chemical Decontaminate  weekly  or contamination.   The  hood  should  be  decontaminated  per  manufacturer’s recommendation.    Most  hoods  are  decontaminated  by  wiping  down  the  interior  of  the hood with a moisten gauze or towel of detergent, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or sodium hypochlorite.    All  waste  should  be  discarded  in  sealable  plastic  bags  and  placed  in  a plastic chemotherapy waste container for disposal.   In addition to a Biological Safety Cabinet, properly utilized protective clothing and other equipment  can  minimize  the  risk  of  exposure  to  hazardous  medications.    Healthcare workers  preparing  chemotherapeutic  admixtures  should  wear  powder  free  disposable gloves of 8 gauge and 18 gauge in  thickness, lint free disposable gowns with a closed front, long sleeves, tight-fitting elastic or knit cuffs, hair cover, surgical mask, and shoe covers (if needed for clean room).  The 18 gauge outer gloves should have already been tested and verified for use with chemotherapy drugs.  The inner gloves (second gloves) should be at least 8 gauges in thickness. The inner gloves (second gloves) do not require have been tested and verified for use with chemotherapy drugs.  Gloves should also be changed in between each medication, every 30 minutes, or if a puncture occurs (which ever comes first) to prevent contamination.  Proper technique and supplies designed to aid  in  safe  preparation  should  also  be  used.  The  build-up  of  positive  pressure  in medication  vials  and  syringes  must  be  avoided  at  all  times  to  reduce  aerosolization.  Syringes  with  Luer-lock  should  be  used  in  order  to  reduce  the  potential  for  accidental leaks or separation of the fittings.  Venting devices with hydrophobic filters when used properly  can  provide  an  added  safety.    Closed-system  drug  transfer  devices  combined with safe handling practices add an even great level of protection.  3.  Preparing the Work Area     3.1.  Review Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for medication being prepared   3.2. Double check calculations    3.3.   Assemble the supplies needed to make the admixture (sealable bag, 70% alcohol solution, gauze, towels, syringes, needles, filter needles, vials, etc.)  3.4.   Don protective clothing •  Shoe Covers    •  Put on the hair cover tucking all hair inside the cap •  Put on surgical masks  Don respirator and safety goggles (if not using a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet) •  Using proper technique, wash hands with a germicidal cleanser for at least 60 seconds.  (Start at the top of the hands and work your way down to elbow.  It is also very important to clean under the nails and in between  8 the fingers to ensure proper cleaning.  When rinsing, do so from the tip of the fingers to the elbow, do not let the water run off of your fingertips) •  Put on the gown (must be worn with sleeves down) •  Put on the first pair of gloves and tuck them under the cuffs of the gown •  Put on the outer gloves, pulling them securely over the gown cuffs to prevent skin exposure.  Wash gloves with germicidal cleanser if not sterile.  Replace gown if it gets wet.)       •  Pull the gown sleeve into place     3.5.   If using Class II BSC, clean work area with 70% alcohol solution or other approved cleaning solution and lint free gauze or towels (wipe from top to bottom, and back to front).  If using Class III BSC, clean all cytotoxic agent vials with alcohol for any possible cytotoxic residue before placing the items in the purge box of the LFGI.  Also, clean the work area with 70% alcohol solution or other approved cleaning solution with lint free gauze or towels (wipe from back to front).  Discarded waste in sealable plastic bag  3.6.   Place preparation mat in the hood  3.7.   Place plastic bag against a side wall  3.8.   Place all supplies on preparation mat  3.9.   Once all supplies are in the hood, swab the stoppers on vials and ports of injections.  Discard gauze in the plastic bag in the hood.  4.  Preparing the Chemotherapeutic Admixture  4.1.   Prime intravenous (IV) infusion lines and/or filters with the correct base IV solution 4.2.  Attach the “primed” IV infusion line and filter (if applicable) to the base solution  bag     4.3. Reconstitute medication  4.4.   Withdraw liquid from vial. Be sure to use the negative pressure technique when withdrawing from the vials.  Do not fill the syringe more than 75% of the syringe to prevent the stopper from coming out from the bottom of the syringe and risk of exposure/contamination.  9 4.5.  Have pharmacist check the “primed” IV infusion lines and filters (if applicable) to ensure that the lines have no air bubbles trapped inside the IV infusion lines 4.6. Have pharmacist check the solution bag and its expiration of the bag with the pharmacy patient label to ensure that it is the correct base solution that the medication will be injected into  4.7.   Have pharmacist check the drug and diluent (if applicable), expiration date of the drug, and quantity of drug in the syringe with the pharmacy patient label to assure accuracy    4.8. Check the bag and line is locked and closed.   4.9.   Inject the medication solution into the bag/bottle (use the negative pressure technique)  4.10.  Seal IV bag/bottle  5.  Preparing the Medication for Delivery  5.1.   Have pharmacist check the admixture to assure that it is correct   5.2.   Label the admixture with the IV label containing patient’s information and the Chemo Warning Label. Warning label must be clearly visible on the outside of the bag and should read as follow: CAUTION: CHEMOTHERAPY HANDLE WITH GLOVES DISPOSE OF PROPERLY   5.3.   Have pharmacist check pharmacy label and finished product for accuracy  5.4.   Place properly labeled medication in a plastic chemo bag (first bag) labeled with the pharmacy patient label and bag the bag again (double bag) in a plastic chemo bag with the pharmacy patient label.  Ensure bag/bottle is capped and sealed before transport.  Hand-carry to ward or clinic or let the nurse/doctor know the product is ready for pick-up per local procedures.  Ensure anyone transporting the products takes a Chemotherapy Spill Kit and is briefed on safe handling and risks of exposure.  6.  Cleaning the Work Area   6.1.   Place items to be discarded into sealable plastic bag  6.2.   Disinfect Biological Safety Cabinet by wiping down with 70% alcohol and/or other approved cleaning detergent/solution.  Allow alcohol/solution to dry on surface.  Do  10 not rinse or towel dry.  The use of alcohol for disinfecting the BSC or LFGI will not deactivate any hazardous drugs and may even result in the spread of contamination rather than any actual cleaning.  Most MSDSs for many hazardous drugs recommend sodium hypochlorite solutions as an appropriate deactivating agent.   6.3.   Dispose of all gauze and toweling in sealable bag and place in chemotherapy waste container for disposal along with needles, syringes, vials, and other waste  6.4.   Remove protective clothing:  •  First, remove the outer pair of gloves by placing your gloved fingers on the outside of the glove cuff.  Remove one glove halfway by scooping the cuff over the palm of the hand.  Never touch the inner glove or the skin with the outside of the gloved fingers. Once the top glove is over the palm it can be removed easily without touching the contaminated fingertips to any clean area.  Remove the outer glove from the other hand and dispose of both in a plastic sealable bag.  •  Remove and dispose of the gown, glasses, mask, hair cover, shoe covers, and inner gloves.   6.5.   Dispose of all contaminated clothing and disposable equipment in a plastic sealable bag and place in the chemotherapy waste container  6.6.  Wash hands thoroughly  7.
