Major changes  include  incorporating  required  Service  activities  published  in  DoDI  3150.09,  The Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  and  Nuclear  (CBRN)  Survivability  Policy  (e.g.,    including “CBRN  Mission  Critical”  determinations  in  all  CDDs  and  CPDs),  aligning  Headquarters  Air Force  (HAF)  roles  and  responsibilities  with  appropriate  HAF  offices,  and  including  a  decision tool  to  help  make  “mission  critical”  and    “CBRN  mission  critical”  determinations.      Processes assigned  to  be  monitored  by  the  Countering  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  (CWMD)  Policy Working Group (PWG) were deleted. 1.  CBRN Survivability 1.1.  Vision.  The  intent  of  this  Instruction  is  to  facilitate  the  CBRN  survivability  of  MCS/I required  to  support  combatant  commanders.    CBRN  Survivability  is  defined  in  DoDI 3150.09  as  “the  capability  of  a  system  to  avoid,  withstand,  or  operate  during  and  after exposure to a CBRN environment (and relevant decontamination process) without losing the ability to accomplish the assigned mission.”  CBRN survivability policies implemented in the National  Security Strategy, National  Defense Strategy, National  Military  Strategy, planning guidance  outlined  in  the  Quadrennial  Defense  Review,  Strategic  Planning  Guidance,  Joint Programming  Guidance,  Transformation  Planning  Guidance,  and  the  family  of  Joint Operations  Concepts  lay  the  foundation  for  needed  Air  Force  capabilities.  The  capabilities are employed to achieve desired effects in support of the strategies listed above.  The Lead Command/Sponsor  of  an  Air  Force  system  implements  required  CBRN  survivability capabilities  through  planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  execution  (PPBE)  processes; capability  requirements  development;  acquisition  activities;  and  operations.   “Lead Command” and “Using Command” are used in this  Instruction as described in AFPD 10-9, Lead Command Designation and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems; “Sponsor” is used as described in AFI 10-601, Operational Capability Requirements Development. 1.1.1.  The Air Force ensures CBRN survivability  of required Air Force  MCS/I through hardening,  timely  resupply,  redundancy,  mitigation  techniques  (i.e.,  tactics,  techniques, and  procedures  (TTP)),  or  a  combination  thereof.    CBRN  Survivability  considerations apply throughout the system’s/infrastructure’s life cycle. 1.1.2.  Lead/Using  Command(s)  must  ensure  nuclear  systems  and infrastructure addressed by DoDD S-5210.81, United States Nuclear Weapons Command and Control, Safety,  and  Security  (i.e.,  nuclear  command  and  control  (NC2)  systems,  associated facilities  and  equipment)  are  hardened  against  nuclear  attacks  and  have  a  continuing nuclear  hardness  assurance  (HA)  or  hardness  maintenance  and  hardness  surveillance (HM/HS) program in place. 1.1.3.  If  non-NC2  systems/infrastructure  require  hardening  to  survive  in  nuclear environments, Lead/Using Command(s) shall ensure applicable HA or HM/HS programs are  in  place  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  AFI  63-101/20-101,  Integrated  Life  Cycle Management.    They  should  also  maintain  preventive  maintenance  checks  and  services programs  (PMCS)  for  systems/infrastructure  hardened  for  CBR  contamination survivability  and  monitor  facility/structure  effectiveness  in  accordance  with  the operations and maintenance manuals. AFI10-2607  21 APRIL 2016 3 1.2.  The  Lead  Command/Sponsor  should  include  a  “mission  critical”  determination  in  all Capability  Development  Documents  (CDD)  and  Capability  Production  Documents  (CPD) generated  through  the  Joint  Capabilities  Integration  and  Development  System  (JCIDS).  MCS/I  expected  to  survive  and/or  operate  in  CBR  contamination  or  nuclear  environments should  be  designated  “CBRN  Mission  Critical”;  use  Figure  1.1  to  help  guide  “Mission Critical”  and  “CBRN  Mission  Critical”  decisions.    “Mission  Critical”  and  “CBRN  Mission Critical”  designations  determined  by  Lead  Commands/Sponsors  for  Air  Force  systems  are subject  to  review  and  approval  by  the  Air  Force  Requirements  Review  Group  (AFRRG) and/or the Air Force Requirements Oversight Council (AFROC). 4 AFI10-2607  21 APRIL 2016 Figure 1.  Mission Critical Decision Tool.  1.2.1.  Mission Critical Definition. Per DoDI 3150.09, a mission critical system (MCS) is defined  as  “a  system  whose  operational  effectiveness  and  operational  suitability  are essential to successful mission completion or to aggregate residual combat capability.

CBRN  Mission-Critical—That  subset  of  mission-critical  systems  with  operational  concepts requiring employment and survivability in a CBR environment or a nuclear environment. CBRN Survivability—DoDI 3150.09 defines CBRN Survivability as the capability of a system to avoid, withstand, or operate during and/or after exposure to a CBR environment (and relevant decontamination) or a nuclear environment, without losing the ability to accomplish the assigned mission.  CBRN  survivability  is  divided  into  CBR  survivability,  which  is  concerned  with  CBR contamination including fallout, and nuclear survivability, which covers nuclear weapon effects, including blast, EMP and other radiation and shockwave effects. Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP)—The electromagnetic radiation from a nuclear explosion caused by  Compton-recoil  electrons  and  photoelectrons  from  photons  scattered  in  the  materials  of  the nuclear  device  or  in  a  surrounding  medium.  The  resulting  electric  and  magnetic  fields  may couple with electrical/electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges. Lead  Command—The  command  that  serves  as  the  operators’  interface  with  the  Program Manager for a system as defined by AFPD 10-9. Mission Critical System—A system whose operational effectiveness and operational suitability are essential to successful mission completion or to aggregate residual combat capability. If this system  fails,  the  mission  likely  cannot  be  completed.    Such  a  system  can  be  an  auxiliary  or supporting system, as well as a primary mission system. Mission  Critical  Report—An  annual  report  required  by  DoDI  3150.09  that  identifies  a Service’s Mission Critical Systems/Infrastructure and includes CBRN survivability assessments for those systems expected to survive and/or operate in chemical, biological, radiological and/or nuclear environments. NC2  System—The  combination  of  facilities,  equipment,  communications,  procedures,  and personnel  essential  for  planning,  directing,  and  controlling  nuclear  weapons,  weapons  systems, and associated operations. Nuclear Environment—The environment created by nuclear weapon effects (air blast, thermal radiation, nuclear radiation, fallout, and EMP). 12 AFI10-2607  21 APRIL 2016 Nuclear Hardening—The employment of any design or manufacturing technique or component applied  to  an  item/system  that  allows  it  to  avoid  failure  or  destruction,  resist  malfunction (temporary  or  permanent)  and/or  prevent  degraded  performance  induced  by  nuclear  weapon effects. Such systems are considered to be nuclear hardened. Nuclear  Survivability—The  capability  of  a  system  to  withstand  exposure  to  a  nuclear environment  without  interruption  to  its  designated  mission  throughout  its  life-cycle.  Nuclear survivability  may  be  accomplished  by  hardening,  redundancy,  mitigation  techniques  (including operational techniques), or a combination thereof. Sponsor—The  organization  responsible  for  documentation,  periodic  reporting,  and  funding actions necessary to support needed capabilities (e.g., MAJCOM, FOA, DRU, etc.). Using Command—Those commands operating a system, subsystem, or item of equipment.
