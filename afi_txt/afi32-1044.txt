Hasberry) Pages: 9   This  instruction  implements  Air  Force  policy  directive  (AFPD)  32-10,  Installations  and Facilities.  It defines requirements and establishes standards for all visual air navigation facilities at  U.S.  Air  Force  facilities  within  the  continental  United  States  (CONUS)  and  at  overseas locations  supporting  Air  Force  flight  operations.    The  airfield  lighting  systems  engineer  at  Air Force  Civil  Engineer  Center,  Operations  Directorate  (AFCEC/CO),  is  the  primary  point  of contact for definitions and guidance contained within this instruction.  Use this instruction when programming,  designing,  constructing,  and  installing  visual  air  navigation  systems  and  related facilities.  Consult Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation Facilities, for  detailed  information  on  standard  configurations  and  equipment.    This  instruction  applies  to Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  units.  This  publication may  be  supplemented  at  any  level,  but  all  direct  Supplements  must  be  routed  to  the  Office  of Primary Responsibility (OPR) of this publication for coordination prior to certification approval.  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirement in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3”)  number  following  the  compliance  statement.    See  AFI  33-360, Publications and Forms Management, for a description of the authorities associated with the Tier numbers.    Submit  requests  for  waivers  through  the  chain  of  command  to  the  appropriate  Tier waiver  approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  Publication  OPR  for  non-tiered  compliance items.   Refer recommended changes and questions about  this publication to  the OPR using the AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Forms 847 from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command.  Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained in accordance with Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records,  and disposed of in  accordance with  the  Air  Force   2  AFI32-1044  24 DECEMBER 2014 Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System  (AFRIMS).    The  use  of  the  name  or  mark  of  any  specific  manufacturer,  commercial product, commodity, or service in this publication does not imply endorsement by the Air Force.  SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Major changes include  the  addition  of  Tier  levels  as  required  by  AFI  33-360.    Guidance  in  this  publication  is based on requirements prescribed by 14 CFR Part 77, Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace, and 14 CFR, Part 91, General Operating and Flight Rules.  1.  PURPOSE.  This instruction defines requirements for all visual air navigation systems at Air Force  facilities.    See  UFC  3-535-01  for  standard  configurations  and  approved  equipment characteristics. 2.  BACKGROUND. 2.1.  The  term  “visual  air  navigation  systems”  refers  to  lights,  signs,  symbols,  and  other devices  and/or  systems  located  on  and  in  the  vicinity  of  an  airfield  that  provide  visual reference and guidance to pilots when operating aircraft on the ground and in the air.  They supplement  the  guidance  provided  by  markings  and  electronic  aids  such  as  tactical  air navigation (TACAN), precision approach radar (PAR), and instrument landing system (ILS) for operating aircraft. 2.2.  Visual  air  navigation  systems  must  be  standardized  for  operational  safety. Standardization  requires  lights  with  the  same  intended  use  to  be  identical  in  color  and configuration  at  each  airfield  (refer  to  UFC  3-535-01  for  specific  requirements)  to  enable pilots to interpret the guidance readily, with assurance of accuracy and minimal distraction. 3.  APPLICATION.  Use  this  instruction  and  its  complement,  UFC  3-535-01,  for  planning, design,  construction,  sustainment,  restoration,  and  modernization  of  new  visual  air  navigation systems  at  Air  Force  installations,  fields,  ranges,  and  expeditionary  locations.    Do  not  install visual air navigation equipment or configurations not covered in this instruction and UFC 3-535-01 without an appropriate waiver. (T-0) 4.  RESPONSIBILITIES. 4.1.  Air  Force  Director  of  Civil  Engineers  (AF/A4C).  Establishes  policies  for  visual  air navigation systems at Air Force facilities. 4.2.  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center  (AFCEC).  Establishes  technical  requirements through  unified  facilities  criteria  (UFC),  in  accordance  with  mission  requirements  and enforces  UFCs  and  AF  policies  for  visual  air  navigation  systems.    Clarifies  intent  of  AF policies and provides final interpretation of UFCs, as they apply to Air Force systems, for Air Force and Air National Guard installations. (T-1) 4.3.  Base Civil Engineer (BCE).  (T-1) 4.3.1.  Maintains  airfield  lighting  and  associated  grounding  systems,  in  accordance  with UFC, NEC and Federal Aviation Administration requirements. (T-0) AFI32-1044  24 DECEMBER 2014   3  4.3.2.  Performs required testing to validate condition of air navigation systems.  Tests may be used as justification for replacement of systems or subsystems. (T-1) 4.3.3.  Programs  projects  necessary  to  construct,  maintain,  or  repair  visual  air  navigation systems. (T-1) 4.3.4.  Provides  inspection  of  completed  projects  to  validate  contract  compliance,  prior  to project acceptance. (T-1) 5.  BASE  RIGHTS.  Construction  of  an  airfield  in  a  foreign  country  requires  a  grant  of operational  control  which  normally  is  accomplished  pursuant  to  an  international  agreement  (as defined in Department of Defense Directive (DODD) 5530.3, International Agreements) with the host  nation.    This  agreement  may  take  the  form  of  a  Defense  Cooperation  Agreement,  a  Base Rights  Agreement,  an  Implementing  Agreement,  a  Host  Nation  Funded  (Construction) Agreement (HNFA), a Bilateral Infrastructure Agreement (BIA), or an agreement by a different title.  Provisions of these agreements must be observed, but in instances where construction does not conform to international standards or standards of the host nation, seek legal advice.  Many of  these  agreements  require  the  United  States  to  consult  with  and/or  obtain  approval  from  the host  nation  before  beginning  construction.    An  HNFA  allocates  the  responsibilities  for construction  funding  between  the  United  States  and  the  host  nation.  NATO  members  execute BIAs, which are financed by mutual agreement among the parties to the BIA.  If it appears a new international agreement will be necessary, follow the procedures outlined in DODD 5530.3 and AFI  51-701,  Negotiating,  Concluding,  Reporting,  and  Maintaining  International  Agreements.  Seek legal advice prior to taking any action that could result in an international agreement. (T-0) 6.  VISUAL AND ELECTRONIC AIDS.  Air Force installations will use visual air navigation aids  and  associated  electronic  aids  for  operational  categories  outlined  in  Tables  1  and  2  within Attachment 2, Visual Landing Aids Requirements.  (T-0 for all “R” required aids and T-1 for all other aid determinations as noted within Tables 1 and 2)  JUDITH A.
