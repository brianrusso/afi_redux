    DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS, UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON, DC  MEMORANDUM FOR  DISTRIBUTION C MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs AFI36-2909_AFGM2017-01 13 MARCH 2017  FROM  HQ USAF/JA              1420 Air Force Pentagon               Washington DC 20330-1040  SUBJECT:  Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional                  Relationships By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Air Force Guidance Memorandum immediately changes AFI 36-2909, Professional and Unprofessional Relationships, dated                    1 May 1999.  Compliance with this Memorandum is mandatory.  To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails in accordance with   AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.  This Air Force Guidance Memorandum (AFGM) establishes command, supervisory and personal responsibilities in prohibiting retaliation against an alleged victim or other member of the Armed  Forces (hereafter, military members) for reporting a criminal offense.  Retaliation against individuals who report criminal offenses is unlawful and erodes good order, discipline, respect for authority, unit cohesion and ultimately mission accomplishment.  In addition, this AFGM incorporates the specific prohibitions that define unprofessional relationships between recruiters, prospective Airmen, recruits, entry-level trainers and entry-level trainees and mandates discharge processing for certain prohibitions as defined in DoDI 1304.33, Protecting Against Inappropriate Relations During Recruiting and Entry Level Training, 28 January 2015.  It is the responsibility of commanders and supervisors at all levels to ensure compliance with this instruction.    The policy set out in this instruction applies to all Regular Air Force (RegAF) members and to members of the United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard (ANG), except as provided in paragraph 3.8.  Military members, including Reserve members on active duty or inactive duty for training and ANG members in Federal service, who violate the specific prohibitions contained in paragraphs 11 and 19 of this instruction can be prosecuted under either Article 92 or Article 134 of the Uniform code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or both, as well as any other applicable Article of the UCMJ, as appropriate.    The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement.  See AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with 2  AFI36-2909_AFGM2017-01   13 March 2017 the Tier numbers.  Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority, or alternately, to the Publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items.  (ADD New) 11.  Prohibition on Retaliation.  Military members shall not retaliate against an alleged  victim or other military member who reports a criminal offense.  (T-0).  [NOTE:  This paragraph is directive in nature and failure to adhere to the standards set out in this instruction can form the basis for adverse action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  An example would be a dereliction of duty offense under Article 92.]    (ADD New) 11.1.  Retaliation.  Retaliation is taking or threatening to take an adverse personnel action, or withholding or threatening to withhold a favorable personnel action, with respect to a military member because the member reported a criminal offense.  (ADD New) 11.2.  Ostracism.  Ostracism, which is a form of retaliation under this instruction, is wrongfully excluding a military member from social acceptance or membership in or association with a group of which such military member was a part or a reasonable person would conclude wanted to be a part with the intent to do any of the following: (1) inflict emotional distress on the military member; (2) discourage reporting of a criminal offense or sexual harassment; or (3)  otherwise discourage the due administration of justice concerning a criminal offense or sexual harassment; and, because the perpetrator knew or believed that:  (ADD New) 11.2.1.  The member reported or was planning to report a criminal offense or sexual harassment;  (ADD New) 11.2.2.  The member was a victim or alleged victim of a criminal offense or sexual harassment;  (ADD New) 11.2.3.  The member was reported by another as being a victim of a criminal offense or sexual harassment;  (ADD New) 11.2.4.  The member intervened to prevent or attempt to prevent a criminal offense or sexual harassment from occurring; or,  (ADD New) 11.2.5.  The member cooperated in an investigation or the member has served or will serve as a witness or otherwise cooperate in the future in a criminal, disciplinary, or administrative proceeding or investigation involving a criminal offense or sexual harassment.   (ADD New) 11.3.  Maltreatment.  Maltreatment, which is a form of retaliation under this instruction, is treatment by peers or by other persons, that, when viewed objectively under all the circumstances, is abusive or otherwise unnecessary for any lawful purpose, that is done with the intent to discourage reporting of a criminal offense or otherwise discourage the due administration of justice, and that results in physical or mental harm or suffering, or reasonably could have caused, physical or mental harm or suffering.  Maltreatment under this instruction is prohibited by the NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014, 113 P.L. 66, Section 1709(b), 127 Stat. 672, and does not require a senior-subordinate relationship as is required for maltreatment under Article 93, UCMJ.  AFI36-2909_AFGM2017-01   13 March 2017  3 (ADD New) 11.4.  Personnel Action.  Any action taken on a military member that affects or has the potential to affect that military member’s current position or career.  Such actions include promotion; disciplinary or other corrective action; transfer or reassignment; a performance evaluation; decisions concerning pay, benefits, awards, or training, relief and removal; separation; discharge; referral for mental health evaluations in accordance with DoD Instruction 6490.04, Mental Health Evaluations of Members of the Military Services; and any other significant change in duties or responsibilities inconsistent with the military member’s grade.  (ADD New) 11.5.  Member of the Armed Forces (Military Member).  Included in this definition are regular component military personnel, and ARC personnel when performing active duty, full-time  National Guard duty, or inactive duty training.  (ADD New) 11.6.  Criminal Offense.  An act or omission punishable under the UCMJ, or other federal, state or local criminal law.  (ADD New) 12.  Individual Responsibility to Refrain from Engaging in Retaliation.  All military members share the responsibility to refrain from retaliating against an alleged victim or other military member who reports a criminal offense.  (ADD New) 13.  Commander and Supervisory Responsibilities to Prevent Retaliation. Commanders and supervisors at all levels have the authority and responsibility to ensure subordinates do not retaliate against an alleged victim or other military member who reports a criminal offense. Commanders and supervisors have a duty to prevent retaliation and may be held accountable for failing to act in appropriate cases.  (T-0).  (ADD New) 14.  Actions in Response to Retaliation.  A commander or supervisor must take appropriate action if it is reasonable to believe retaliation has occurred. At a minimum, the member or members suspected of engaging in retaliation will be ordered to cease from engaging in any further retaliation. As soon as practicable, the alleged victim, or other military member who is believed to have been retaliated against, will be informed that command is aware of the suspected act or acts of retaliation, and that the alleged offenders have been ordered to cease from engaging in any further retaliation.  The individual retaliated against will be advised to report any further acts of retaliation.  (T-0).  (ADD New) 15.  Relationship of Retaliation to Other Provisions of the UCMJ.  All military members are subject to lawful orders. When a military member has been lawfully ordered to cease from engaging in retaliation, the military member is subject to prosecution under the UCMJ for violation of that order.  (ADD New) 16.  Relationship of Retaliation to Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program.  Cases involving retaliation or allegations of retaliation, should be evaluated to determine if they involve 1) reprisal for making a protected communication in violation of  10 U.S.C. §1034 and DoD Directive (DoDD) 7050.06, Military Whistleblower Protection, Chapter 6, or 2) restriction from making lawful communications to a Member of Congress or an Inspector General (IG) in violation of 10 U.S.C. §1034 and DoDD 7050.06, Military Whistleblower Protection, Chapter 7.  If so, immediately refer the matter to the Inspector General Complaints Resolution Program in accordance with AFI 90-301, Inspector General Complaints Resolution, para. 1.13.6. 0 3 4  AFI36-2909_AFGM2017-01   13 March 2017 (ADD New) 17.  Questions Regarding Retaliation.  Military members who have questions as to the application or interpretation of the policy should consult their commander.  Commanders are highly encouraged to consult their staff judge advocates or servicing legal offices for assistance in interpretation.  (ADD New) 18.  Recruiting, Entry-Level Processing, and Entry-Level Training.  The first impression that most prospective Airmen receive of the Air Force is through contact with a recruiter.  This experience is a critical first step in the development of prospective Air Force members because the recruiter establishes expectations about all aspects of life in the Air Force.  In addition, the relationship provides the prospective Airman the first example of the Air Force core values and standards of conduct.  Once a prospective Airman gains acceptance and enters the Air Force, the next critical developmental steps are entry-level processing and entry-level training.  The positive attitude, approach to professionalism, demonstration of proper professional relationships, and reflection of the Air Force core values by recruiters and trainers in these steps are critical to shaping new Airmen.  These critical developmental steps must not be compromised by unprofessional relationships between recruiters and prospective Airmen or recruits; nor by trainers and trainees.  Paragraph 19 of this instruction, and its subparagraphs, outlines the specific prohibitions that define unprofessional relationships in the recruiting and training environment.    (ADD New) 18.1.  All Air Force personnel treat each prospective Airman, applicant, recruit, and trainee with dignity and respect as they pursue their aspiration of serving in the military.  Air Force policy prohibits inappropriate relations between recruiters and prospects, applicants, and/or recruits and between trainers providing entry-level training and trainees.  (ADD New) 18.2.  Inappropriate relationships and prohibited activities between recruiters and prospective Airmen, applicants, and/or recruits and between trainers providing entry-level training and trainees, as defined in this instruction, are not permitted and appropriate action will be taken.   (ADD New) 18.3.  Paragraph 19 of this instruction, and its subparagraphs, outline the specific prohibitions that define unprofessional relationships in the recruiting and training environment.  (ADD New) 18.4.  This instruction does not change Air Force policy as it relates to Sexual Assault Response and Prevention (SAPR) program.  For questions relating to Air Force or DoD SAPR policy consult AFI 90-6001, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program, 21 May 2015 (incorporating change 1, 18 March 2016); DoD Directive 6495.01, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program, 23 January 2012 (incorporating change 2, effective 20 January 2015); or, DoD Instruction 6495.02, Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) Program Procedures,  28 March 2013 (incorporating change 2, effective 7 July 2015).     (ADD New) 19.  Prohibited activities between recruiter-recruits and trainer-trainees.  Prohibited activities between a recruiter and a prospective Airman, an applicant, or a recruit are outlined in paragraph 19.1 and subparagraphs.  Prohibited activities between a trainer providing entry-level training and a trainee are also outlined in paragraph 19.1 and subparagraphs.  Prohibited activities for which a recruit or trainee may be held accountable are outlined in paragraph 19.2 and subparagraphs.  These prohibitions begin on the date of first contact between a prospective member of the Air Force and a recruiter, through accession and initial skills training, and for six months after the trainee completes initial skills training or ending on the date on which the member physically arrives at that member’s first duty assignment following completion of initial entry training, whichever is greater.  AFI36-2909_AFGM2017-01   13 March 2017  5  [NOTE:  This paragraph is directive in nature and failure to adhere to the standards set out in this instruction can form the basis for adverse action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  An example would be a dereliction of duty offense under Article 92.]  (T-0).  (ADD New) 19.1.

Before performing recruiter duties, recruiters will sign a DD Form 2982 Recruiter/Trainer Prohibited Activities Acknowledgment, to acknowledge their understanding of the prohibitions listed in the subparagraphs of paragraph 19.1 of this instruction and their responsibilities to avoid the prohibited inappropriate behaviors and relations outlined in this chapter.  Recruiters will certify the form annually.  The form will be locally filed and kept for five years after the recruiter has left. (T-0).   (ADD New) 19.3.2.  During the initial visit, recruiters will provide all prospective Airmen with contact information that can be used to notify someone if they believe their recruiter has acted improperly. (T-0).  (ADD New) 19.3.3.  No later than the first visit with a recruiter following a recruit’s entry into the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), recruits must sign a DD Form 2983, Recruit/Trainee Prohibited Activities Acknowledgment, to acknowledge their understanding of the prohibitions listed in the subparagraphs of paragraph 19.2 of this instruction.  The DD Form 2983 will be filed in the recruit’s personnel file and kept in accordance with system policy. (T-0).    (ADD New) 19.3.4.  Exceptions may be granted to accommodate relationships that existed before the recruit started the recruiting process. These relationships include, but are not limited to, family members.  Only the recruiter’s commander in the grade of O-4 or higher, or a higher level authority, has the authority to approve these exceptions.  Recruiters must request the exception in writing to their commander.  Higher level commanders may withhold this authority from subordinate commanders.  All exceptions will be documented on DD Forms 2982 and/or 2983 as applicable. (ADD New) 19.4.  Administrative Requirements for Trainers and Trainees.  At a minimum and as required, trainees and trainers who provide entry-level training will complete the following administrative actions.  Commands may add requirements to this list. (T-0)    (ADD New) 19.4.1.  Trainers providing entry-level training will sign a DD Form 2982 that acknowledges their understanding of the prohibitions listed in the subparagraphs of paragraph 19.1 of this instruction and their responsibilities regarding the policies prohibiting inappropriate behaviors and relations outlined in this instruction.

Higher level commanders may withhold this authority from subordinate commanders.  Trainers and trainees must request the exception in writing to their commander. All exceptions will be documented on the DD Form 2982.  (ADD New) 19.5.  Special Considerations.  The prohibited activities listed in paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2, are not intended to eliminate all trainer and trainee external classroom professional development and mentorship opportunities, as these opportunities are an important part of the learning process and lead to healthy mentoring relationships.  The prohibitions listed in paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2 related to private dwellings, privately-owned vehicles, alcohol, and social gatherings do not apply to command-authorized programs such as the Air Force Academy’s Cadet Sponsorship program or other similar social development programs within ROTC programs, which provide breadth and depth to the education of future leaders.  The prohibitions in paragraphs 19.1 and 19.2 related to private dwellings, alcohol and social gatherings also do not apply to command-authorized unit social or professional development events, such as unit dining in/out events, holiday receptions, or hail and farewell events, or inclusive group social functions, such as those by wing, group, squadron, element, to which all group members are invited.  Leaders are responsible for setting the right command climate and providing guidelines for outside the classroom mentoring and team-building activities.  (ADD New) 19.6.  Accountability for Violations.    (ADD New) 19.6.1.  Violations of the specific prohibitions and requirements of this chapter by military personnel may result in prosecution under the UCMJ, adverse administrative action, or discharge from active duty.  Substantiated violations of the prohibitions outlined in paragraphs 19.1.1, 19.1.2, 19.1.3, and 19.1.4, of this instruction, by any Air Force recruiter or trainer providing entry-level training, will require the offender to be processed for administrative separation, unless the offender is otherwise punitively discharged or dismissed from the Air Force for the violation through UCMJ prosecution.  The requirement to initiate administrative processing does not mean that the result of that processing must be administrative discharge; whether administrative discharge is appropriate depends upon the specific facts of each individual case.  (T-0).  See AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen; AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures for Commissioned Officers; or, AFI 36-3207, Separating Commissioned Officers.  (ADD New) 19.6.2.  Findings of wrongdoing for actions identified in the subparagraphs of paragraph 19.1 of this instruction against any military recruiter or military trainer providing entry-level training will result in the recruiter or trainer being held accountable at the discretion of their commander.  (ADD New) 19.6.3.  Civilian recruiters or trainers providing entry-level training who violate one or more of the subparagraphs of paragraph 19.1 of this instruction may be subject to disciplinary action up to removal.  Activities are reminded to fulfill applicable labor relations obligations before implementing this directive for civilian employees.  Air Force organizations that have Air Force publications, supplements, or other guidance on this topic will immediately review their policies and update them as required. AFI36-2909_AFGM2017-01   13 March 2017  9  (ADD New) 19.6.4.  For contract employees with substantiated violations of the subparagraphs of paragraph 19.1 of this instruction (charges supported by a preponderance of the evidence), the command to whom the contractor provides recruiting or training services will immediately contact the cognizant contracting officer for the contract.  The command should not take disciplinary action against either the contractor or the contractor employee.  The contracting officer has authority to take such action against the contractor as is warranted under the contract to the extent that a substantiated violation by the contractor’s employee is deemed a violation of the terms and conditions of the contractor’s contract with the Air Force.

Moorman) Pages: 10   This instruction establishes command, supervisory and personal responsibilities for maintaining professional  relationships  between  Air  Force  members,  between  Air  Force  members  and members of other uniformed services, between Air Force members and civilian employees of the Department  of  Defense,  to  include  Air  Force  civilian  employees,  and  between  Air  Force members  and  government  contractor  employees.  Unprofessional  relationships  are  those interpersonal relationships that erode good order, discipline, respect for authority, unit cohesion and, ultimately, mission accomplishment. It is the responsibility of commanders and supervisors at  all  levels  to  ensure  compliance  with  this  instruction.  The  policy  set  out  in  this  instruction applies  to  all  active  duty  members  and  to  members  of  the  United  States  Air  Force  Reserve (USAFR) and Air National Guard (ANG), except as provided in paragraph 3.8., below. Officers, including  Reserve  officers  on  active  duty  or  inactive  duty  for  training  and  ANG  officers  in Federal  service,  who  violate  the  custom  of  the  service  against  fraternization  or  the  specific prohibitions contained in paragraph 5.1 of this instruction can be prosecuted under either Article 92 or Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), or both, as well as any other applicable  article  of  the  UCMJ,  as  appropriate.  This  instruction  implements  Air  Force  Policy Directive (AFPD) 36-29, Military Standards. SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document is substantially revised and must be completely reviewed. This instruction has been revised to include specific prohibitions on the formation of personal relationships in the recruiting and training environments (paragraph 3.5); to stress the use of a stepped approach to enforcement of the policy, taking into consideration all the surrounding facts   2  AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999 to and circumstances (paragraph 8.); and, to stress  the prevention of unprofessional relationships through training and leadership by example (paragraph 9.). 1.  General.  Professional  relationships  are  essential the  effective  operation  of  all organizations, both military and civilian, but the nature of the military mission requires absolute confidence  in  command  and  an  unhesitating  adherence  to  orders  that  may  result  in inconvenience, hardships or, at times, injury or death. This distinction makes the maintenance of professional  relationships  in  the  military  more  critical  than  in  civilian  organizations.  While personal relationships between Air Force members are normally matters of individual choice and judgment,  they  become  matters  of  official  concern  when  they  adversely  affect  or  have  the reasonable potential to adversely affect the Air Force by eroding morale, good order, discipline, respect  for  authority,  unit  cohesion  or  mission  accomplishment.  Professional  relationships  are those  interpersonal  relationships  consistent  with  Air  Force  core  values:  integrity  first,  service before  self,  and  excellence  in  all  we  do.  Military  members  understand  that  the  needs  of  the institution  will  sometimes  outweigh  personal  desires.  This  guidance  focuses  on  the  impact  of personal relationships on the interests of the Air Force as an institution. The guidance set forth in this instruction is based, in part, on the custom against fraternization that has been a part of and enforced within the American military for over 200 years. 2.  Policy. 2.1.  Professional Relationships.  Professional relationships are those that contribute to the effective operation of the Air  Force. The Air Force  encourages personnel to communicate freely  with  their  superiors  regarding  their  careers,  performance,  duties  and  missions.  This type  of  communication  enhances  morale  and  discipline  and  improves  the  operational environment while, at the same time, preserving proper respect for authority and focus on the mission. Participation by members of all grades in organizational activities, unit-sponsored events, intramural sports, chapel activities, community welfare projects, youth programs and the like can enhance morale and contribute to unit cohesion. 2.2.  Unprofessional  Relationships.  Relationships  are  unprofessional,  whether  pursued  on or  off-duty,  when  they  detract  from  the  authority  of  superiors  or  result  in,  or  reasonably create  the  appearance  of,  favoritism,  misuse  of  office  or  position,  or  the  abandonment  of organizational  goals  for  personal  interests.  Unprofessional  relationships  can  exist  between officers,  between  enlisted  members,  between  officers  and  enlisted  members,  and  between military personnel and civilian employees or contractor personnel. Fraternization is one form of unprofessional relationship and is a recognized offense under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). 2.2.1.  Fraternization.  Fraternization, as defined by the Manual for Courts-Martial, is a personal  relationship  between  an  officer  and  an  enlisted  member  that  violates  the customary bounds of acceptable behavior in the Air Force and prejudices good order and discipline, discredits the armed services, or operates to the personal disgrace or dishonor of  the  officer  involved.  The  custom  recognizes  that  officers  will  not  form  personal relationships with enlisted members on terms of military equality, whether on or off-duty. Although the custom originated in an all male military, it is gender neutral. Fraternization can occur between males, between females and between males and females. Because of the  potential  damage  fraternization  can  do  to  morale,  good  order,  discipline,  and  unit cohesion,  the  President  specifically  provided  for  the  offense  of  fraternization  in  the AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999   3  Manual for Courts-Martial. (See Manual for Courts-Martial, 1998 Edition, Part IV, para- graphs  59  and  83  for  a  discussion  of  fraternization  and  the  related  offense  of  conduct unbecoming an officer.) for  All  Military  Personnel 3.  General  Guidelines for  Avoiding  Unprofessional Relationships, Including Fraternization.  Military experience has shown that certain kinds of personal  relationships  present  a  high  risk  of  becoming  unprofessional.    Personal  relationships that  are  not  initially  unprofessional  may  become  unprofessional  when  facts  or  circumstances change.  For  example,  a  close  personal  relationship  between  officers  or  between  enlisted members can easily become unprofessional if one member becomes the commander, supervisor or  rater  of  the  other.  Air  Force  members,  both  officer  and  enlisted,  must  be  sensitive  to  the formation of these personal relationships, as well as the possibility that relationships that are not initially  unprofessional  may  become  so  due  to  changed  circumstances.  The  rules  regarding personal  relationships  must  be  somewhat  elastic  to  accommodate  differing  conditions  and operational necessities; however, the underlying standard is that Air Force members are expected to  avoid  those  relationships  that  negatively  affect  morale,  discipline,  respect  for  authority  and unit cohesion. When economic constraints or operational requirements place senior and junior members in close proximity with one another (such as combined ranks or joint use clubs, joint recreational  facilities  or  mixed  officer/enlisted  housing  areas)  military  members  are, nevertheless,  expected  to  maintain  professional  relationships.  The  mere  fact  that  maintaining professional relationships may be more difficult under certain circumstances does not relieve a member from the responsibility to maintain Air Force standards. 3.1.  Relationships  Within  an  Organization.  Familiar  relationships  between  members  in which one member exercises supervisory or command authority over the other can easily be or become unprofessional. Similarly, differences in grade increase the risk that a relationship will  be,  or  will  be  perceived  to  be  unprofessional,  because  senior  members  in  military organizations normally exercise authority or some direct or indirect organizational influence over  the  duties  and  careers  of  more  junior  members.  The  danger  for  abuse  of  authority  is always  present.  The  ability  of  the  senior  member  to  influence,  directly  or  indirectly, assignments, promotion recommendations, duties, awards, and other privileges and benefits, places  both  the  senior  member  and  the  junior  member  in  vulnerable  positions.  Once established,  such  relationships  do  not  go  unnoticed  by  other  members  of  a  unit. Unprofessional  relationships,  including  fraternization,  between  members  of  different services,  particularly  in  joint  service  operations,  can  have  the  same  impact  on  morale, discipline, respect for authority and unit cohesion, as if the members were assigned to the same service, and must be avoided. 3.2.  Relationships  with  Civilian  Employees and  Government  Contractor Personnel.  Civilian  employees  and  contractor  personnel  are  an  integral  part  of  the  Air Force.  They  contribute  directly  to  readiness  and  mission  accomplishment.  Consequently, military  members  of  all  grades  must  maintain  professional  relationships  with  civilian employees and government contractor personnel, particularly those whom they supervise or direct, and must avoid relationships that adversely affect or reasonably can adversely affect morale, discipline and respect for authority or that violate law or regulation. 3.3.  Dating and Close Friendships.  Dating, courtship, and close friendships between men and women are subject to the same policy considerations as are other relationships. Like any personal  relationship,  they  become  matters  of  official  concern  when  they  adversely  affect   4  AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999 morale, discipline, unit cohesion, respect for authority, or mission accomplishment. Members must recognize that these relationships can adversely affect morale and discipline, even when the  members  are  not  in  the  same  chain  of  command  or  unit.  The  formation  of  such relationships  between  superiors  and  subordinates  within  the  same  chain  of  command  or supervision  is  prohibited  because  such  relationships  invariably  raise  the  perception  of favoritism or misuse of position and erode morale, discipline and unit cohesion. 3.4.  Shared Activities.  Sharing living accommodations, vacations, transportation, and off-duty interests on a frequent or recurring basis can be, or can reasonably be perceived to be, unprofessional.  These  types  of  arrangements  often  lead  to  claims  of  abuse  of  position  or favoritism. It is often the frequency of these activities or the absence of any official purpose or  organizational  benefit  which  causes  them  to  become,  or  to  be  perceived  to  be, unprofessional.  While  an  occasional  round  of  golf,  game  of  racquetball  or  similar  activity between a supervisor and a subordinate could remain professional, daily or weekly activities could  result  at  a  minimum  in  the  perception  of  an  unprofessional  relationship.  Similarly, while it might be appropriate for a first sergeant to play golf with a different group of officers from his or her organization each weekend, in order to get to know them better, playing with the same officers every weekend might be, or reasonably be perceived to be, unprofessional. 3.5.  Recruiting,  Training,  Schools  and  Professional  Military  Education.  Personal relationships  between  recruiters  and  potential  recruits  during  the  recruiting  process  or between students and faculty or staff in training schools or professional military education (PME)  settings  are  generally  prohibited.  These  interpersonal  relationships  are  especially susceptible to abuse of position, partiality or favoritism, or can easily create the appearance of such. This is particularly true during the recruiting process and in basic military training, because  the  potential  recruit  or  junior  military  member  is  often  unfamiliar  with  Air  Force standards and dependent on the senior member,  and the senior member is in a position to directly  affect,  positively  or  negatively,  the  career  of  the  junior  member.  Consequently, additional, specially tailored rules are needed in the recruiting and training environments. 3.5.1.  Recruiting.  The  first  impression  of  the  Air  Force  that  most  military  men  and women form is through their contacts with a recruiter. This experience is a critical step in the  development  of  Air  Force  members;  it  establishes  expectations  and  begins  the formation of Air Force core values. The relationship between recruiter and applicant must be  completely  professional.  Consequently,  recruiters  will  not  form  unprofessional personal relationships with applicants. At a minimum, recruiters will not date or carry on a social relationship with an applicant, or seek or engage in sexual activity with, or make sexual advances to, or accept sexual overtures from an applicant. In addition, recruiters will not use grade, position, threats, pressure or promises to attain or attempt to attain any personal  benefit  of  any  kind  from  an  applicant.  Recruiters  will  not  gamble  with,  lend money  to,  borrow  money  from  or  become  indebted  to  an  applicant,  or  use  personal resources to provide an applicant with lodging or transportation or any other benefit. The same  limitations  govern  relationships  between  recruiters  and  an  applicant’s  immediate family members. 3.5.2.  Basic  Military  Training  and  Initial  Technical  Training.  The  integrity  and leadership  of  the  faculty  and  staff  in  basic  military  training  and  the  initial  technical training environment must not be permitted to be compromised by personal relationships with  trainees.  At  a  minimum,  faculty  and  staff  will  not  date  or  carry  on  a  social AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999   5  relationship  with  a  trainee,  or  seek  or  engage  in  sexual  activity  with,  make  sexual advances to, or accept sexual overtures from a trainee. In addition, faculty and staff will not  use  grade,  position,  threats,  pressure  or  promises  to  attain  or  attempt  to  attain  any personal benefit of any kind from a trainee, or share living quarters with, gamble with, lend  money  to,  borrow  money  from  or  become  indebted  to,  or  solicit  donations  (other than  for  Air  Force  approved  campaigns)  from  a  trainee.  The  same  limitations  govern personal  relationships  between  faculty  and  staff  and  a  trainee’s  immediate  family members. Trainees have an independent obligation not to engage in these activities with members of the faculty and staff. 3.5.3.  Other Training and Education Settings . The integrity and leadership of faculty and staff in all formal training and PME settings must not be compromised by personal relationships with trainees or students. At a minimum, faculty and staff will not date or carry  on  a  social  relationship  with  a  trainee  or  student,  or  seek  or  engage  in  sexual activity  with,  make  sexual  advances  to,  or  accept  sexual  overtures  from  a  trainee  or student.  In  addition,  faculty  and  staff  will  not  use  grade,  position,  threats,  pressure  or promises to attain or attempt to attain any personal benefit of any kind from a trainee or student or members of a trainee or student’s immediate family. 3.5.4.  Supplementation  of  this  Instruction in  the  Recruiting,  Training  and Education  Environments.  Commands  providing  recruiting,  training  and  education functions  may,  consistent  with  this  instruction,  publish  supplemental  directives,  to include punitive provisions, to regulate personal relationships in the recruiting, education, training, school and similar environments. 3.6.  Treatment,  Care  and  Counseling.  Persons  undergoing  medical  or  psychological treatment or care, or receiving medical, psychological, pastoral, legal or other professional counseling may be dependent on, and therefore vulnerable to, those providing such services. Personnel providing treatment, care and counseling have a duty to refrain from using their position  to  gain  any  personal  benefit  from  persons  who  are  receiving  their  services.  In particular, personnel providing such services will not seek or engage in sexual activity with, make sexual advances to, or accept sexual overtures from persons who  are receiving their services or the immediate family members of those receiving their services. 3.7.  Other  Relationships.  Other  relationships,  not  specifically  addressed  above,  can, depending  on  the  circumstances,  lead  to  actual  or  perceived  favoritism  or  preferential treatment and, if so, must be avoided. Examples of activities that may result in an adverse impact  on  morale,  discipline  and  respect  for  authority  are  gambling  or  partying  with subordinates, soliciting or making solicited sales to subordinates and entering into business ventures with members who are junior in rank, grade or position. (See DoD Directive 5500-7.R [the Joint Ethics Regulation], subsections 2-205 and 5-409 for guidance on solicitation and commercial activities), (set out in Attachment 1 to this instruction). 3.8.  Air Reserve Component (ARC) Personnel.  In applying the principles set out in this instruction  to  ARC  personnel,  when  not  performing  active  duty,  full-time  National  Guard duty, or inactive duty training, commanders and supervisors should tailor the application and enforcement of the principles to appropriately address unique situations that may arise from part-time service.   6  AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999 4.  Relationship of Unprofessional Conduct to Other Provisions of the UCMJ.  All military members  are  subject  to  lawful  orders.  When  a  military  member  has  been  lawfully  ordered  to cease  an  unprofessional  relationship  or  refrain  from  certain  conduct,  the  military  member  is subject to prosecution under the UCMJ for violation of the order. Similarly, all military members are  subject  to  prosecution  for  criminal  offenses  committed  incidental  to  an  unprofessional relationship  (e.g.,  gambling,  adultery,  assault).  In  addition,  officers  may  be  prosecuted  for violation  of  the  specific  prohibitions  listed  in  paragraph  5.1,  and  its  subparagraphs  (below); violation of the custom against fraternization; and conduct unbecoming an officer. 5.  Specific  Prohibitions  Relating  to  Officers  (Fraternization).  Unprofessional relationships between officers and enlisted members have a high potential for damaging morale and discipline and for compromising the standing of officers. Consequently, officers have an ethical and a legal obligation to avoid certain relationships and activities. Officers must not engage in any activity with an enlisted member that reasonably may prejudice good order and discipline, discredit the armed forces or compromise an officer’s standing. The custom against fraternization in the Air Force  extends  beyond  organizational  and  chain  of  command  lines.  In  short,  it  extends  to  all officer/enlisted relationships. 5.1.  Specific  Prohibitions.  Conduct  that  violates  the  custom  of  the  Air  Force  against fraternization can be prosecuted under Article 134 of the UCMJ. In addition, with reasonable accommodation  for  married  members  and  members  related  by  blood  or  marriage,  the following conduct is prohibited and can be prosecuted under either Article 92 of the UCMJ, Article 134, or both, and any other applicable article of the UCMJ when appropriate: 5.1.1.  Officers Will Not Gamble With Enlisted Members. 5.1.2.  Officers Will Not Lend Money to, Borrow Money From or Otherwise Become Indebted  to  Enlisted  Members.  exception:  Infrequent,  non-interest-bearing  loans  of small amounts to meet exigent circumstances. 5.1.3.  Officers  Will  Not  Engage  in  Sexual  Relations  with  or  Date  Enlisted Members.  Dating  as  set  out  here  includes  not  only  traditional,  prearranged,  social engagements  between  two  members,  but  also  includes  more  contemporary  social activities that would reasonably be perceived to be a substitute for traditional dating. 5.1.3.1.  Officer/Enlisted  Marriages.  When  evidence  of  fraternization  exists,  the fact  that  an  officer  and  enlisted  member  subsequently  marry  does  not  preclude appropriate command action based on the prior fraternization. The fact that an officer is  married  to  an  enlisted  member  is  not,  by  itself,  evidence  of  misconduct.  For example,  some  officer-enlisted  marriages  are  created  by  the  commissioning  of civilians married to enlisted members, or by the commissioning of enlisted members married to other enlisted members. Other officer-enlisted marriages may result from force reductions and nonselection for promotion of some officers who then reverted to enlisted status. Regardless of how the officer-enlisted marriage came to be, married members are expected to respect all customs and courtesies observed by members of different  grades  when  they  are  on  duty,  in  uniform  in  public,  or  at  official  social functions. 5.1.4.  Officers Will Not Share Living Accommodations with Enlisted Members Except When Reasonably Required by Military Operations. AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999   7  5.1.5.  Officers  Will  Not  Engage,  on  a  Personal  Basis,  in  Business  Enterprises  with Enlisted  Members,  or  Solicit  or  Make  Solicited  Sales  to  Enlisted  Members,  Except  as Permitted by the Joint Ethics Regulation. For the application of this rule, members should consult DoD Directive 5500.7-R, the Joint Ethics Regulation, subsections 2-205 and 5-409, (set out in Attachment 1 to this instruction) 6.  Individual Responsibility To Maintain Professional Relationships.  All military members share the responsibility for maintaining professional relationships. However, the senior member (officer or enlisted) in a personal relationship bears primary  responsibility  for maintaining the professionalism  of  that  relationship.  Leadership  requires  the  maturity  and  judgment  to  avoid relationships  that  undermine  respect  for  authority  or  impact  negatively  on  morale,  discipline, respect  for  authority,  or  the  mission  of  the  Air  Force.  This  is  especially  true  of  officers  and noncommissioned  officers  who  are  expected  to  exhibit  the  highest  standards  of  professional conduct and to lead by example. The senior member in a relationship is in the best position to appreciate the effect of that particular relationship on an organization and in the best position to terminate or limit the extent of the relationship. However, all members should expect to be and must be held accountable for the impact of their conduct on the Air Force as an institution. 7.  Command  and  Supervisory  Responsibilities.  Commanders  and  supervisors  at  all  levels have the authority and the responsibility to maintain good order, discipline and morale within their units. They may be held accountable for failing to act in appropriate cases. 8.  Actions in Response to Unprofessional Relationships.  If a relationship is prohibited by this instruction  or  is  causing  (or  if  good  professional  judgment  and  common  sense  indicate  that  a relationship  may  reasonably  result  in)  a  degradation  of  morale,  good  order,  discipline  or  unit cohesion, a commander or supervisor should take corrective action. Action should normally be the least severe necessary  to terminate the unprofessional aspects of the  relationship. The  full spectrum of administrative actions is available and should be considered. Administrative actions include, but are not limited to, counseling, reprimand, creation of an unfavorable information file (UIF), removal from position, reassignment, demotion, delay of or removal from a promotion list, adverse or referral comments in performance reports and administrative separation. One or more  complementary  actions  can  be  taken.  Experience  has  shown  that  counseling  is  often  an effective  first  step  in  curtailing  unprofessional  relationships.  More  serious  cases  may  warrant administrative  action  or  nonjudicial  punishment.  Referral  of  charges  to  a  court-martial  is  not appropriate  except  in  aggravated  cases.  An  order  to  terminate  a  relationship,  or  the  offensive portion  of  a  relationship,  can  and  should  be  given  whenever  it  is  apparent  that  lesser administrative action may not be effective. Officers or enlisted members who violate such orders are subject to action under the UCMJ for violation of the order. Instances of actual favoritism, partiality, or misuse of grade or position may constitute independent violations of the UCMJ or the punitive provisions of the Joint Ethics Regulation. 8.1.  Responses  To  Cases Involving  Dating  or  Sexual  Relationships.  When unprofessional conduct includes evidence of a sexual relationship, the sexual relationship is but one factor to be considered in determining the adverse impact, if any, on the organization and, hence, an appropriate response. It is the impact or reasonably foreseeable consequences of the conduct on morale, discipline, good order, unit cohesion and mission accomplishment that  determines  its  seriousness,  not  its  characterization,  even  if  the  conduct  could  be characterized as adultery or some other potential offense. No fact, standing alone, necessarily warrants  referral  of  charges  to  a  court-martial.  When  a  relationship  has  had  an  adverse   8  AFI36-2909  1 MAY 1999 impact on the Air Force, unprofessional conduct should not be excused simply because the parties to the unprofessional relationship subsequently marry or one of the parties leaves the service. 9.  Training.  Instruction on the concepts of unprofessional relationships and fraternization shall be  made  a  part  of  the  curricula  for  basic  training,  commissioning  programs,  and  professional military education for all military personnel. Commanders, judge advocates and supervisors will familiarize  themselves  with  this  instruction  (in  particular  paragraph  8.)  and  commanders  will make certain all personnel are briefed on this policy on an annual basis or more frequently. 10.  Questions  Regarding  This  Instruction.  Military  members  who  have  questions  as  to  the application  or  interpretation  of  the  policy  should  consult  their  commander.  Commanders  are encouraged  to  consult  their  staff  judge  advocates  or  servicing  legal  offices  for  assistance  in interpretation.  WILLIAM A.

Excerpts from the Joint Ethics Regulation. A DoD employee shall not knowingly solicit or make solicited sales to DoD personnel who are junior in rank, grade or position, or to the family members of such personnel, on or off duty. In the absence of coercion or intimidation, this does not prohibit the sale or lease of a DoD employee’s non-commercial personal or real property or commercial sales solicited and made in a retail establishment during off-duty employment. The posting of an advertisement in accordance with Federal Government building management policies does not constitute solicitation for purposes of this section. DoD 5500.7-R subsection 5-409, Commercial Dealings Involving DoD Employees. Excerpts from the Joint Ethics Regulation. A DoD employee shall not knowingly solicit or make solicited sales to DoD personnel who are junior in rank, grade or position, or to the family members of such personnel, on or off duty. In the absence of coercion or intimidation, this does not prohibit the sale or lease of a DoD employee’s non-commercial personal or real property or commercial sales solicited and made in a retail establishment during off-duty employment. The posting of an advertisement in accordance with Federal Government building management policies does not constitute solicitation for purposes of this subsection. a.  This prohibition includes the solicited sale of insurance, stocks, mutual funds, real estate, cosmetics, household supplies, vitamins, and other goods or services. b.  Both the act of soliciting and the act of selling as a result of soliciting are prohibited. In both cases, however, a solicitation is necessary for a violation to occur. While the standard prohibits a senior from making a solicited sale to a junior or to the junior’s family, sales made because a junior approaches the senior and requests the sale to be made are not prohibited, absent coercion or intimidation by the senior. c.  Personal commercial solicitations by the spouse or other household member of a DoD employee to those who are junior in rank, grade, or position to the DoD employee, may give rise to the appearance that the DoD employee himself is using his public office for personal gain. When a spouse or household member of a DoD employee engages in such activity, the supervisor of the DoD employee must consult an Ethics Counselor, and counsel the DoD employee that such activity should be avoided where it may (1)  Cause actual or perceived partiality or unfairness; (2)  Involve the actual or apparent use of rank or position for personal gain; or (3)  Otherwise undermine discipline, morale, or authority.
