This  instruction  provides  cyberspace  operations  examiners  and  cybercrew members  with  procedures  and  evaluation  criteria  used  during  performance  evaluations  on operational cyberspace weapon systems. For evaluation purposes, refer to this AFI for evaluation standards. Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency  and  capabilities  of  cybercrew  members.  In  addition  to  general  criteria  information and  grading  criteria,  this  AFI  provides  specific  information  and  grading  criteria  for  each  crew position, instructor upgrade qualification and Stan/Eval examiner objectivity evaluations. 1.2.  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication.  Recommendations  for  improvements  to this  volume  will  be  submitted  on  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication, through  the  appropriate  functional  chain  of  command  to  HQ  USAF/A3CX/A6CX.  Approved recommendations will be collated into interim or formal change notices, and forwarded to HQ 24 AF/A3T for HQ 24 AF/A3 approval. 1.3.  Waivers.  Unless  another  approval  authority  is  cited  ("T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3"),  waiver authority for this volume is the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).  Submit requests for waivers using AF Form 679 through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. If approved,  waivers  remain  in  effect  for  the  life  of  the  published  guidance,  unless  the  waiver authority specifies a shorter period of time, cancels in writing, or issues a change that alters the basis for the waiver. 1.4.  Procedures: 1.4.1.  Standardization  and  Evaluation  Examiners  (SEEs)  will  use  the  grading  policies contained  in  AFI  17-202V2  and  the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  instruction  volume  for conducting all AFSPC and AFSPC-oversight units’ weapon system performance, Cybercrew Training  Device  (CTD)  and  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  All  evaluations assume a stable platform and normal operating conditions. Compound emergency procedures (multiple, simultaneous emergencies) will not be used. 1.4.2.  Each squadron will design and maintain evaluation profiles for each mission/weapon system  that  includes  information  on  each  crew  position.  These  profiles,  approved  by OG/OGV, should outline the minimum number and type of events to be performed/observed to  satisfy  a  complete  evaluation.  Evaluation  profiles  will  incorporate  requirements established in the applicable grading criteria and reflect the primary unit tasking (T-3). 1.4.3.  All evaluations fall under the Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN) or Spot (SPOT) categories listed in  AFI  17-202V2. For dual/multiple qualification or difference evaluations that  do  not  update  an  eligibility  period,  list  as  "SPOT"  on  the  front  of  the  AF  Form  4418, Certificate of Cybercrew Qualification, and explain that it was a difference evaluation under "Mission Description." (T-3)   AFI17-2CSCSV2  11 MAY 2017 5 1.4.3.1.  Schedule  all  evaluation  activity  on  one  mission/sortie  to  the  greatest  extent possible. All  performance phase requirements should be accomplished during a training (or  operational  if  training  not  available)  mission/sortie.  If  a  required  event  is  not accomplished during a mission/sortie, OG/CC is the waiver authority for the event to be completed  in  the  CTD.  This  may  be  delegated  no  lower  than  SQ/CC  unless  otherwise authorized in position specific chapters of this instruction volume. (T-2) 1.4.3.2.  During  all  evaluations,  any  grading  areas  observed  by  the  evaluator  may  be evaluated. If additional training is identified for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 4418. (T-2) 1.4.3.3.  This  AFI  contains a table of requirements  for the  written requisites and a table for  the  grading  criteria  for  various  evaluations.  Each  table  may  include  a  "Note"  which refers to a general note found in the individual grading criteria, and/or a number, which refers  to  a  note  shown  below  the  table.  To  complete  an  evaluation,  all  areas  annotated with an "R" must be successfully completed. (T-2) 1.4.3.4.  Unit  examiners  may  administer  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization  to include  administering  evaluations  between  AFSPC,  AFRC  and  ANG  provided  written agreements/understandings  between  the  affected  organizations  are  in-place.  Written agreements/understandings shall be reviewed and updated annually (T-3). 1.4.4.  Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize safety. Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining the overall grade. The SEE will state  the  examinee’s  overall  rating,  review  with  the  examinee  the  area  grades  assigned, thoroughly  critique  specific  deviations,  and  recommend/assign  any  required  additional training (T-2). 1.4.5.  SEEs  will  not  evaluate  students  with  whom  they  have  instructed  50%  of  the qualification/upgrade training or those they recommend for qualification/upgrade evaluation without SQ/CC approval. (T-3) 1.4.6.  All  crewmembers  for  the  mission/sortie  (to  include  students,  instructors,  examinees, and  evaluators)  will  participate  in  and  adhere  to  all  required  mission  planning,  mission briefing, mission execution, and mission debriefing requirements. All crewmembers must be current  on  CIF  and  meet  all  Go/No-Go  requirements  IAW  AFI  17-202  series  instructions, this  instruction  and  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance  prior  to  operating,  instructing  or evaluating on the weapon system (T-2). 1.5.  General Evaluation Requirements: 1.5.1.  Publications  Check.  In  units  where  crewmembers  are  individually  issued  operating manuals,  checklists,  crew  aids,  etc.,  for  use  in  conducting  operations,  a  publications  check will  be  accomplished  for  all  evaluations.  The  publications  check  will  be  annotated  in  the Comments block of the AF Form 4418 only if unsatisfactory. List of Effective Pages (LEP) and annual “A” page checks in individually issued operating manuals must be accomplished, documented and current. Unit OGV will list the required operating publications in the local CIF  Library  and/or  local  supplement  to  AFI  17-202V2.  NOTE:    In  units  where  such resources  are  not  individually  issued  but  made  available/accessible  for  common  use,  the 6 AFI17-2CSCSV2  11 MAY 2017 squadron Stan/Eval office will list those items (version and date) and ensure the accuracy and currency of the information contained in those resources for common use. (T-2) 1.5.2.  Written Examinations: 1.5.2.1.  The requisites in Table 1.1 are common to all CSCS crew positions and will be accomplished  IAW  AFI  17-202V2,  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance  and  unit directives.  These  will  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  mission/sortie  performance  phase unless in conjunction with an N/N QUAL. NOTE:  An N/N evaluation conducted in the examinee’s eligibility period and meeting all required QUAL profile requirements affords the  examinee  to  opt  for  the  N/N  evaluation  to  satisfy  a  periodic  QUAL,  in  which  the examinee  may  complete  written  and  EPE  requisites  after  the  performance  phase. However, the written examination(s) and EPE must be completed prior to the examinee’s expiration date (T-2). 1.5.3.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  Every  Qualification  evaluation,  which updates  an  expiration  date,  will  include  an  EPE.  Qualification  EPEs  will  evaluate  the crewmember’s  knowledge  and/or  performance  of  emergency  procedures,  to  include  use  of emergency  equipment.  Use  the  Emergency  Procedures/Equipment  grading  criteria  for  all emergency  situations.  Use  Systems  Knowledge/Operations  grading  criteria  to  evaluate general  systems  operation.  An  EPE  will  be  accomplished  orally  and  may  be  accomplished prior  to  the  mission  with  any  unit  SEE  conducting  a  scenario-based  evaluation  using question/answer (Q&A) techniques, preferably during the SEE pre-brief with the examinee. Units  will  determine  scenarios  for  EPEs.  The  SEE  will  assign  an  overall  EPE  grade.  The evaluation criteria for EPEs is defined in Area 8, para 2.4.8. Document the accomplishment and result of the EPE in the Written Phase block of Section II Qualification on the AF Form 4418 (T-2). Table 1.1.

The Emergency Procedure Examination (EPE) is required for all INIT QUAL and subsequent periodic QUAL evaluations covering duties in the member’s primary crew position. See paragraph 1.5.3. for procedures/requirements for conducting EPEs.  AFI17-2CSCSV2  11 MAY 2017 7 1.5.4.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluations.  These  evaluations  measure  a  crewmember’s ability  to  meet  grading  areas  listed  on  Table  1.2.  at  the  end  of  this  chapter  and  defined  in Chapter  2  of  this  instruction.  IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  lead  MAJCOM  guidance,  QUAL evaluations  may  be  combined  with  MSN  evaluations.  When  practical,  QUAL  evaluations should be combined with Instructor evaluations, as applicable for the crew position. (T-2) 1.5.5.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  lead  MAJCOM  guidance,  the requirement  for  a  separate  MSN  evaluation  may  be  combined  with  the  QUAL  evaluation. The various procedures and techniques used throughout the different weapon system variants are  managed  through  a  training  program,  which  results  in  a  mission  certification.  Mission certifications  will  be  IAW  AFI  17-202  Volume  1,  Cybercrew  Training,  AFI  17-2CSCS Volume  1,  Cyberspace  Security  and  Control  System  (CSCS)  Cybercrew  Training,  and  all applicable  supplements  and  will  be  documented  in  the  appropriate  training  folder.  MSN evaluation grading areas are also listed on Table 1.2. at the end of this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 of this instruction. (T-2) 1.5.5.1.  For cybercrew members who maintain multiple mission certifications, recurring evaluations  need  only  evaluate  the  primary  mission  events  as  long  as  currency  is maintained in all other required training events. (T-2) 1.5.6.  Instructor Evaluations. Grading areas for these evaluations are listed on Table 1.2. at the  end  of  this  chapter.  See  Chapter  3  of  this  instruction  for  amplified  information  and grading area definitions. 1.5.7.  Stan/Eval  Examiner  (SEE)  Objectivity  Evaluations.  Grading  areas  for these evaluations  are  listed  on  Table  1.2.  at  the  end  of  this  chapter.  See  Chapter  4  of  this instruction for amplified information and grading area definitions. (T-2) 1.5.8.  No-Notice Evaluations. OG/CC will determine no-notice evaluation procedures/goals     (T-3). 1.6.  Grading  Instructions.  Standards  and  performance  parameters  are  contained  in  AFI  17-202V2 and this instruction. A three-level grading system is used for most areas; however, a "Q-" grade will not be indicated under critical areas. 1.6.1.  Critical Area/Subarea. Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by  the  examinee  to  successfully  and  safely  achieve  the  mission/sortie  objectives  and complete  the  evaluation.  These  events,  if  not  adequately  accomplished  could  result  in mission failure, endanger human life, or cause serious injury or death. Additionally, critical areas/subareas  apply  to  time-sensitive  tasks  or  tasks  that  must  be  accomplished  as expeditiously  as  possible  without  any  intervening  lower  priority  actions  that  would,  in  the normal  sequence  of  events,  adversely  affect  task  performance/outcome.  If  an  examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be "Q-3." Critical areas are identified by "(C)" following the applicable area title. (T-2) 1.6.2.  Non-Critical  Area/Subarea.  Non-critical  areas  are  events  or  tasks  deemed  integral  to the performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and  mission  execution.  If  an  examinee  receives  a  "U"  grade  in  a  non-critical  area  then  the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification 8 AFI17-2CSCSV2  11 MAY 2017 based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. Non-critical  areas are identified by "(N)" following the applicable area title. (T-2) 1.6.3.  If  an  examinee  receives  a  "U"  grade  in  a  non-critical  area  then  the  overall  grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SEE, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. (T-2) 1.6.4.  The SEE must  exercise judgment  when the wording of  areas is  subjective and when specific situations are not covered. (T-2) 1.6.5.  Evaluator  judgment  will  be  the  final  determining  factor  in  deciding  the  overall qualification level. (T-2)   AFI17-2CSCSV2  11 MAY 2017 9 Table 1.2.
