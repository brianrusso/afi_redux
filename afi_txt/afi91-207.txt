SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  is  substantially  revised  and  must  be  completely  reviewed.  This  revision implements  a  change  to  categorization  of  vehicles.  The  document  was  reorganized  to  place requirements so they  align with  appropriate  chapter within the document.  A section was added for backing of government-owned motor vehicles and clarified training requirements for vehicle operators  and  spotters.  It  incorporates  changes  from  guidance  memorandum  GM  02-2015  and broadens  guidance  by  reference  to  DoDI  6055.04  and  clarifies  definitions.  It  removes  the requirement to  document  training in  MilPDS.  It  eliminates and modifies  various Traffic Safety Courses requirement to comply with SECAF reducing ancillary training directives.

The  intent  of  this  chapter  is  to  assist  commanders  in  developing  local  traffic safety  program  and  to  identify  minimum  standards  for  government  and  non-government  motor vehicles and motorized transportation devices. 2.2.  Government-Owned Vehicles 2.2.1.  Government Motor Vehicle (GMV): 2.2.1.1.  Commercial  GMVs  for  use  in  the  United  States  and  US  territories  and possessions  shall  meet  all  applicable  requirements  of  49  CFR  (Code  of  Federal Regulations)  571,  Federal  Motor  Vehicle  Safety  Standards  (FMVSS),  and  Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 for the year of manufacture. (T-0) 2.2.1.2.  Commercial  GMVs  of  foreign  manufacture  purchased,  leased  or  rented  for  use outside  the  United  States  and  US  territories  and  possessions  shall  meet  all  applicable safety requirements of the country in which they are to be used IAW DoDI 6055.04. (T-0) 2.2.2.  Government Vehicle Other (GVO): 2.2.2.1.  The  majority  of  GVOs  are  off-highway  motorized  vehicles  such  as specialty/special  purpose,  material  handling,  construction  or tactical  vehicles. Commanders will limit the use of GVOs to off-road areas and tactical operations as much as possible. (T-0) 2.2.2.2.  The use of GVOs in traffic is considered incidental to their travel between off-road areas. Users will ensure their movement on and off AF installations complies with applicable traffic laws and codes. (T-0) 2.2.2.3.  The  installation  commander  may  authorize  the  routine  use  of  GVOs  in  traffic, industrial or pedestrian environments based on a risk assessment IAW AFI 90-802. 2.2.2.4.  Owning  organizations  will  ensure  every  GVO  has  a  written  plan  of  instruction (POI), IAW AFI 24-301 and AFMAN 24-306, to include identifying vehicle operational environment, usage requirements and manufacturer recommendations. (T-1) 2.2.3.  Low Speed Vehicles (LSV): 2.2.3.1.  The installation commander may authorize the use of LSVs in traffic, industrial or pedestrian environments based on a risk assessment IAW AFI 90-802. 2.2.3.2.  LSVs will meet all FMVSS standards and be identified by the  manufacturer as an LSV. (T-0) 2.2.3.3.  Routine use of LSVs will be restricted to low-risk roadways of AF installations with speed limits not exceeding 35 miles per hour. (T-1) 2.2.4.  Motor Vehicle Operations: 2.2.4.1.  Owning  organizations  of  government-owned  motor  vehicles  will  ensure operators meet the requirements of AFI 24-301 and AFMAN 24-306. (T-1) AFI91-207  16 FEBRUARY 2017 11 2.2.4.2.  Transportation  of  munitions/explosives  must  comply  with  AFMAN  91-201, Explosives Safety Standards. 2.2.5.  Motor Vehicle Safety Standards: 2.2.5.1.  Vehicle design  standards will meet  all requirements of DoDI 6055.04, AFI 24-301, AFI 24-302, and this instruction. 2.2.5.2.  Installations  located  in  the  US  will  adopt  and  enforce  the  state  laws  regarding standards  for  motor  vehicles  in  traffic  as  described  in  DoDD  5525.4,  Enforcement  of State Traffic Laws on DoD Installations. (T-0) 2.2.5.3.

(T-0)  Include  the  cost  of damage and injuries resulting from mishaps as a part of the TOC. tactical  and  combat  vehicles  whether  purchased 2.2.5.4.  AF  special  purpose, commercially or designed to contract specifications, shall be equipped with safety belts, shoulder  harnesses  and  occupant  rollover  protection,  unless  the  designated  DoD Component Acquisition Executive determines such equipment unacceptably degraded an essential military characteristic. (T-0) 2.2.5.5.  When available as a procurement option, equip government-owned commercial-designed  vehicles  at  high  risk  of  mishaps,  mechanical  failure  or  abuse  with  safety monitoring devices (e.g., remote tracking and diagnostic monitoring systems) to support monitoring  of  safe  vehicle  operations  and  to  influence  driving  behavior.  (T-0) Determination of vehicles at high risk will be identified by commander’s risk assessment IAW AFI 90-802. (T-1) 2.2.5.6.
