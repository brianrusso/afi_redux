Background.  To  ensure  the  AF  Forces  Commander  can  generate  sorties following  an  enemy  attack,  the  Airfield  Marking  Team  must  apply  expedient techniques to expeditiously mark and stripe minimum airfield operating surfaces (MAOS) to support the commander’s post-attack air tasking order (ATO).  1.1.1.  Aircraft  movement  is  extremely  hazardous  without  appropriate  airfield pavement  markings  in  a  post-attack  environment.  Marking  and  striping  the MAOS  provides  visual  cues  necessary  for  pilots  to  safely  operate  on  a  battle damaged airfield during taxi, launch, and recovery operations.  1.1.2. The minimum operating strip (MOS) is the smallest acceptable length and width  of  operating  surface  that  meets  an  aircraft's  mission  configuration  for launch  and  recovery,  allows  minimum  clearances  for  operations,  and  can  be readied  to  meet  mission  ATOs.  Marking  and  striping  allow  pilots  to  visually acquire the airfield’s MOS on approach. The repaired surface may be larger than the  absolute  minimum  requirements  for  operations  when  there  is  minimal damage  to  the  runway  and  most  of  the  runway  is  rapidly  recoverable.  The selected MOS allows both launch and recovery after mitigating the unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO) threat, clearing debris, and repairing damage.  1.1.3.  The  MAOS  consists  of  access  routes  to/from  aircraft  staging  locations (i.e., hardened shelters, parking ramp revetments, or dispersed parking spots) as well  as  the  MOS;  these  access  routes  must  also  be  marked  when  damage requires deviation from normal routes. 1.2.  Overview.  After  Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  personnel  have cleared  UXO  allowing  sufficient  space  on  the  MOS  for  the  airfield  recovery teams to begin operations, the Civil Engineer (CE) Unit Control Center (UCC) directs  the  Marking  and  Striping  Team  to  begin  operations  when  and  where appropriate.  1.2.1. Layout of the MAOS consists of identifying, with traffic cones or paint, access taxiways, corners and centerline of the MOS, installation locations for the aircraft arresting system (AAS) and airfield lighting system components. Access taxiway  centerlines,  lead-in  and  lead-out  nose-wheel  guidelines,  holding position lines, and changes in direction (curves) are also identified.  4 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 1.2.2. Marker employment consists of MOS threshold and departure end, edge marker placement, runway distance markers (RDM) and AAS markers assembly and placement. Note: RDMs are described as distance-to-go (DTG) markers in T.O. 35E2-6-1, Minimum Airfield Operating Surface Marking System. 1.2.3. Painting consists of striping the threshold, MOS centerline, departure end line, and blackout of existing airfield  markings that  might cause confusion. In addition,  stripe  useable  access  taxiway  lead-in/out  guidelines,  aircraft  holding position lines, and changes in access taxiway direction. 1.3. Variation of Procedures. It is  likely  the entire  MOS and access taxiway layout  cannot  be  accomplished  without  disruptions.  Legacy  procedures  had MOS layout precede pavement repairs. However, the time allotted to repair the amount of expected damage and numbers of recovery equipment, personnel, and vehicles  throughout  the  MAOS  during the  recovery  process  will  likely  dictate changes to the sequence of marking and striping from those described in T.O. 35E2-6-1.  Legacy  marking  procedures  used  “T”  clear  zones  to  mark  crater repair areas that should not be entered by support teams until the crater has been repaired. With today’s threat, it is unlikely “T” clear zones will be used to mark repair areas, doing so would likely produce “T” clear zones throughout the entire MOS  leaving  little  to  no  real  estate  for  support  teams  (i.e.,  AAS,  Marking, Airfield  Lighting, and  Water  and  Fuel  System  Repair)  to begin  their  recovery efforts.  Follow  T.O.  instructions  and  task  sequencing  to  the  greatest  extent possible;  however,  when  marking  and  striping  processes  conflict  with  other recovery operations, task sequencing may be performed as described in Chapter 4 of this publication to help expedite the process. 1.4. Safety Summary. Personnel responsible for determining correct and proper MAOS  marking  and  striping  procedures  should  become  thoroughly  familiar with and frequently review the specific procedures and safety precautions listed in T.O. 35E2-6-1 and Paint Striping Set Operator’s Manual. 1.4.1.  Correct  MAOS  layout  and  marking  is  critical  to  the  airbase  recovery process.  Incorrect  MAOS  striping  or  improper  placement  of  edge,  runway distance,  and  AAS  markers  may  result  in  major  aircraft  damage  and  potential loss of life to flight and ground personnel. 1.4.2.  Coordinate  with  Airfield  Manager  or  designated  representative  on  all matters  pertaining  to  MAOS  establishment  to  ensure  appropriate  set-back clearances  are  achieved  and/or  appropriate  airfield  restrictions  imposed/ disseminated to base agencies. 5 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 1.4.3. Required individual protective equipment (e.g., safety-toed boots, gloves, hearing  and  eye  protection)  are  utilized  by  all  personnel  involved  in  layout, marking, and striping procedures.  1.4.4. Adhere to the following paint striping machine safety precautions. 1.4.4.1. Never put hands or other body parts under or near paint guns while the system is either running or under pressure. Injection of paint or other fluids such as hydraulic oil into the body may result in injury and possible amputation of the affected area. If fluid is injected into the skin, it is important to treat the injury as soon as possible. 1.4.4.2. Never attempt to repair high pressure hoses or fittings—replace them. 1.4.4.3. Never attempt to stop or deflect leaks  with  your  hand or body. Never plug a hose leak with your finger, with adhesive tape or other “stop-gap” device. 1.4.4.4. Never attempt to clean, oil, or adjust the paint machine while in use. 1.4.4.5. Never flush the paint machine system under high pressure. Never spray solvent or other flushing material through the guns with spray tips in place. An explosion  or  fire  may  result  from  static  electricity  build-up  in  the  presence  of flammable vapors. Always remove spray tips prior to flushing the system. 1.4.4.6.  Never  wipe  off  build-up  around  the  spray  tips  until  pressure  is  fully relieved.  When  the  need  arises  to  work  on  paint  guns  and/or  lines,  always depressurize the entire system first.  1.4.4.7.  Never  use  standard  hardware  to  modify  an  airless  or  high  pressure system; use high pressure fittings only. Call the factory for proper replacement parts and components. 1.4.4.8. The high pressure  hose  must  never be kinked or bent less than a  four inch radius. 1.4.4.9.  If  static  sparking  or  slight  shock  is  felt  while  using  the  paint  striping machine, stop spraying immediately. Check entire system for proper grounding. Do not use the system again until the problem is identified and corrected. Make sure the ground strap, when provided, is always in place and in contact with the ground while operating. 1.4.4.10.  It  is  recommended  to  mount  a  dry  chemical  fire  extinguisher  on  the unit in a convenient location. Be familiar with its operation and keep it properly charged. 6 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 1.4.4.11. Never operate unit without guards or shields in place. 1.4.4.12.  Wear  safety  glasses  and  hearing  protection  when  operating  the  paint striping  machine.  Loose  clothing  should  not  be  worn  when  working  around moving parts. 1.4.4.13. Never operate the unit without safety air relief valves in place. Keep them clean and in good working order.   7 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 Chapter 2 RESOURCES  2.1. Personnel. The MAOS Marking Team, totaling six individuals, is split into two crews to provide expeditious marking and striping capabilities. 2.1.1.  Layout/Marker  Placement  Crew.  An  Engineering  Journeyman  (3E551) and three augmentees layout the MOS and access taxiways and then place the remaining elements of the MAOSMS. 2.1.1.1.  The  Crew  Chief  (usually  an  Engineering  Journeyman)  should  be sufficiently  experienced  on  MAOS  layout  procedures,  direct  operations  of  the Layout/Marking  Crew,  and  coordinating  efforts  through  the  Rapid  Airfield Damage Repair (RADR) Support Chief. 2.1.1.2. The augmentees should be trained on basic layout requirements and be familiar  with  assembly  of  all  markers.  Team  members  should  be  physically capable of handling and positioning marker components. 2.1.2.  Paint  Striping  Crew.  A  Structural  Journeyman  (3E351)  and  one augmentee  use  the  paint  striping  set  to  black  out  confusing/unnecessary  lines and stripe the MOS and taxiways.  2.1.2.1.  The  Structures  Journeyman  should  be  sufficiently  experienced  to operate  and  maintain  the  paint  striping  equipment  during  painting.  He/she should also understand basic requirements for MOS layout, direct efforts of the augmentee,  and  coordinate  efforts  with  the  Layout/Marking  Crew  Leader  and the RADR Support Chief.  2.1.2.2. The augmentee should be familiar with basic operation of the equipment and  capable  of  operating  the  vehicle  among  base  recovery  operations.  The augmentee  should  be  physically  capable  of  handling  and  loading  heavy  paint and glass bead supplies. NOTE: If the Paint Striper fails, manual application of paint  with  sprayers  and  rollers,  and  hand  spreading  of  glass  beads  will  be necessary.  Manual  operations  will  likely  require  additional  manpower  to  meet recovery timelines.  2.2.  System  Equipment.  Four  major  vehicle/equipment  items  associated  with the  system  are:  1)  marking  kit  (i.e.,  traffic  cones,  edge  markers,  RDMs,  and AAS markers); 2) paint striping machine; 3) two full-size pickups (one for cones and markers and the other to tow the paint striper) with heavy-duty suspension 8 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 and adequate loading/towing capacity; and 4) one flatbed utility trailer, with at least a 1.5-ton capacity, to transport equipment (e.g., traffic cones, edge markers, and  sand  bags).  The  flatbed  trailer  facilitates  loading  and  unloading  of  the equipment. The pickup and flatbed trailer are required to efficiently and quickly employ  and  layout  the  marking  system.  If  a  trailer  is  not  available,  a  1.5-ton cargo truck, or larger, may be required for cone and marker layout. 2.2.1. Table 2.1 lists items of the marking kit and Table 2.2 lists consumables.

Category determination of beads should be determined on an installation-by-installation basis, taking into consideration local conditions and life-cycle maintenance costs of pavement markings. Figure 2.1. Marking Kit Markers. Figure 2.2. Paint Striper Examples.    2.2.2.  See  T.O.  35E2-6-1  for  a  complete  description  of  system  components. Note:  Research  to  procure  a new  paint  striping  machine  was  underway  at  the time  of  this  writing.  Either  a  self-propelled  or  truck  mounted  striper  may  be included in the paint striping unit type code (UTC) (4FWPS). 2.3. Pavement Reference Marking System (PRMS). The PRMS is not part of the marking system, but should be used to help identify locations on the runway (Figure  2.3).  This  reference  system  should  be  in  place  prior  to  an  attack  and able to  withstand effects of an attack. To achieve  maximum effectiveness, the PRMS  should  be  employed  on  all  takeoff  or  landing  (ToL)  surfaces.  A  zero point is established for each pavement surface.   10 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 Figure 2.3. Typical Pavement Reference Marking System.  2.3.1.  To  eliminate  the  need  for  time-consuming  manual  measurements,  the PRMS  provides  visual  cues  to  rapidly  identify  damage,  UXO,  Emergency Airfield Lighting System (EALS) and AAS locations; and MAOS coordinates. Damage and UXO are located by identifying distance from the zero point and distance right or left of the centerline.  2.3.2. Distance markings are painted on the pavement surface at 50- or 100-foot intervals along the centerline and along each pavement edge starting at the zero point.  Additionally,  raised  markers  (Figure  2.4)  are  placed  at  50-  or  100-foot intervals  at  a  distance  between  25  to  50  feet  from  the  runway’s  edge  on  both 11 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 sides  of  the  runway  to  provide  redundancy  (Marking  UTC  4F9MS  includes  a raised PRMS). Duplication and dispersal from the pavement edge helps ensure reference  system  survivability  following  an  attack  and  during  recovery operations.  Normally,  the  raised  markers  are  installed  prior  to  an  attack  and included  in  the  engineer  attack  preparation  checklists  in  the  CE  Contingency Response Plan (CRP).  Figure 2.4. PRMS Raised Marker.  2.3.3. The PRMS employs three basic rules: 2.3.3.1.  Zero  Point  Rule.  For  an  airfield  pavement  section,  the  zero  point  is fixed. It does not switch from one end of the pavement to the other. The zero point  is  usually  established  at  the  runway  threshold  where  normal  aircraft operations occur. 2.3.3.2. Centerline Rule. All distances along the length of the pavement section are measured along the centerline from the zero point of that pavement. 2.3.3.3.  Right/Left  Rule.  Right  and  left  of  the  centerline  are  determined  as viewed down the centerline of the pavement away from the zero point.    12 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 Chapter 3 PLANNING FACTORS  3.1. The Situation. The MOS is based on width and length of a runway surface supporting  aircraft  and  mission  configurations  for  emergency  launch  and/or recovery.  The  actual  ToL  surface  may  be  larger  than  minimum  aircraft requirements depending upon numerous factors influencing recovery such as: 1) sortie generation deadline; 2) physical damage to the ToL surface; 3) resources available to perform recovery operations; and 4) number of UXO to mitigate. 3.1.1.  The  mission  and  recovery  situation  largely  dictates  markings  used  to identify  the  MOS.  Markings  provide  acceptable  wartime  concessions  to peacetime  practices  and  standards  in  order  to  provide  rapid  launch  and/or recovery. 3.1.2.  The  marking  system  can  employ  within  acceptable  mission  planning timeframes  for  most  useable  ToL  surfaces.  Depending  upon  sortie  generation timetables,  airfield  marking  may  take  place  simultaneously  with  other  airfield recovery tasks, or be one of the final actions completed. Successful marking and striping operations should be coordinated with the following activities: 3.1.2.1. Damage assessment and MOS Selection. 3.1.2.2. Mitigating UXO on routes from team’s dispersal site and the MAOS. 3.1.2.3. Clearance of large debris on routes to the MOS. 3.1.2.4. Crater, camouflet and spall repair operations. 3.1.2.5. Final debris removal and sweeping of the MOS. 3.1.2.6. AAS and airfield lighting installation. 3.1.3.  Damage  from  the  attack  may  require  changes  to  the  basic  layout configuration  described  in  the  T.O.  The  MOS  layout  is  acceptable  and  meets launch  and/or  recovery  criteria  when  it  meets  the  requirements  of  the  Senior Airfield Authority (SAA). 3.1.4. If the wing commander’s priority is for immediate launch, the initial MOS may not be the final MOS and may not include all expedient markings. In this scenario,  the  MOS  will  probably  be  unidirectional.  The  theater  mission  and wing/installation  commander's  launch  priorities  can  dictate  one  MOS  for immediate  launch  purposes,  while  preparations  for  a  fully  capable,  larger, 13 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 bidirectional MOS are under way for follow-on launch and recovery operations. Figure  3.1  and  the  following  two  paragraphs  provide  an  example  of  this possibility. Figure 3.1. Example of Launch-Only MOS.  3.1.4.1. The SAA at Base X requires launch of one fighter squadron as soon as possible after the attack. The 150-ft by 10,000-ft runway is oriented in an 18/36 direction;  the  36-end  is  the  primary  operational  threshold.  The  runway  is extensively damaged with large craters at both ends and ladder taxiways are also damaged.  There  are  large  numbers  of  spalls  and  UXO.  Providing  a  MOS  for takeoff and landing will take at least 6.5 hours.  3.1.4.2. With  less  UXO  mitigation  and  pavement  sweeping  required,  a 50-  by 3,950-foot launch-only MOS may be repaired and available in three hours. For this  launch-only  MOS,  the  SAA  only  requires  edge  and  RDMs,  and  a  mobile aircraft arresting system (MAAS) installed 2,700 feet from the MOS threshold. While generating sorties from the launch-only MOS, EOD continues to mitigate UXO. Other CE forces begin repairing the 36-end and a ladder taxiway for a 75- by  7,500-foot  ToL  MOS.  The  final  MAOSs  require  complete  contingency marking and striping, an EALS, and relocating the AAS.  3.2. Planning Considerations. Consider the following planning factors prior to commencing recovery operations. 3.2.1. Close coordination with EOD personnel is necessary. The entire width of the MOS is cleared and safed as a minimum, to include 300 feet beyond MOS edges and the first 1,500 feet before the MOS threshold (and departure end if the MOS  will support bidirectional operations). Mitigating UXO  will precede any marking activity by at least 2,000 feet ahead of the marking team. 3.2.2.  Efficiencies  may  be  gained  by  either  the  EALS  crew  or  marking  crew placing  both  edge  lighting  components  and  edge  markers  (Figure  3.2) simultaneously.    14 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 Figure 3.2. Installing Contingency Lighting Inboard of Edge Markers.  3.2.3. During initial MOS layout, set traffic cones at the correct positions for the approach  lighting  and  Precision  Approach  Path  Indicator  (PAPI)  units  as  a minimum  IAW  T.O.  35E2-6-1.  If  additional  UXO  and  debris  clearing  is required  in  order  to  complete  the  lighting  installation  along  with  the  MOS layout,  ensure  the  airfield  base  recovery  timetable  reflects  integration  of  the MOS layout and lighting installation.  3.2.4.  Table  A2.1  in  Attachment  2  provides  a  checklist  of  actions  (and questions  to  ask)  that  help  determine  system  layout.  The  table  is  useful  for planning  rapid  runway  repair  efforts  along  with  airfield  marking.  It  provides information to avoid conflicts during layout and installation of the marking and lighting  systems.  The  CE-UCC  and  RADR  Officer  in  Charge  (OIC)  may  use portions of this table to track information required for layout. 3.3.  PAPI  Location  Factors.  It  is  very  important,  especially  for  emergency recovery  of  aircraft,  to  provide  sufficient  stopping  distance  on  a  short  MOS. Adequate  stopping  distances  are  affected  by  the  weather  and  pavement condition, especially in wet conditions and no porous friction course. The pilot of  an  approaching  aircraft  depends  upon  the  PAPI  to  help  safely  descend  and land on the runway or MOS. Properly located and installed PAPI lights guide a pilot  onto  a  runway’s  touchdown  zone,  maximizing  aircraft  rollout  and  safety margins for protection of both the pilot and the aircraft (Figure 3.3). For short MOS operations where stopping distance is a major consideration, there are four approaches to PAPI placement and installation that will provide increased lengths for safer braking distances.   15 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 Figure 3.3. PAPI Guiding Aircraft to a Safe Landing.  3.3.1.  The  first  approach  is  to  use  the  exact  PAPI  to  threshold  distance (Figure 3.4) if that distance is less than the initial 950 feet location. Figure 3.4 provides a graphic range of values for installing the PAPI from the threshold. It provides distances from the threshold to the PAPI location based on glide slope angles ranging from 2.5° to 4.0°, and height variations between 0 and 10 feet. The figure applies to fighter aircraft and cargo aircraft that are capable of, and approved  for,  short-field  landings.  Fighter  aircraft  can  normally  land  with  a PAPI distance to threshold less than the standard 950-foot distance. This is true even  with  large  differences  in  elevation  between  the  PAPI  and  the  MOS.  For example, with a glide slope of 3° and the PAPI installation site is 5-feet lower than the adjacent MOS centerline, the PAPIs may be installed 850 feet from the threshold. However, if the PAPI is adjusted for a 2.5° glide path approach angle for  fighter  aircraft,  the  950-foot  distance  must  be  increased  for  height differences more than 2 feet. 3.3.2. A second approach is to raise the PAPIs so the centers of the lights are the same height as the runway reference point (RRP) at the MOS centerline (the RRP  is  on  the  MOS  centerline  where  the  pilot’s  line  of  sight  intersects  the runway  according  to  the  approach  glide  slope).  This  eliminates  the  need  to increase the distance from the threshold or to change the standard 3.0° angle of the PAPI units. Using the same example as in paragraph 3.3.1, the PAPIs could be sited 760 feet from the threshold if raised to the height of the MOS centerline. The Layout/Marking Crew Leader determines the proper PAPI elevation.   16 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 Figure 3.4. PAPI Distances from the Threshold.  3.3.3. A third approach is to increase the glide path approach angle above 3° in  order  to  provide  additional  runout  area  for  stopping.  This  method  is  only feasible  for  fighter  aircraft  and  cargo  aircraft  capable  of,  and  approved  for, short-field landings. Again, using the example in paragraph 3.3.1, if the glide slope was increased to 3.5° the PAPIs could be sited 735 feet from the threshold. The SAA approves this method. 3.3.4.  The  fourth  approach  is  to  use  a  combination  of  the  methods  above  to increase aircraft runout and braking distance. For example, if the glide slope is 2.5°  and  the  PAPI  installation  location  is  10  feet  below  the  adjacent  MOS centerline, the glide slope could be raised to 3° and the PAPI could be raised one foot. Doing this would allow the PAPI to be placed 935 feet from the threshold. Again, the SAA approves this technique. 3.3.5.  There  may  be  numerous  additional  reasons  requiring  PAPI  relocation other than braking concerns, such as conflicting with the required AAS location, 17 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 the initial PAPI location is too close to the taxiway, damage at the runway or approach zones, or other obstructions. 3.3.6.  The  EOC  and  CE  UCC  should  consider  all  the  above  when  siting  the MAOS. If a conflict becomes evident when siting the PAPI and/or AAS, contact the RADR OIC and the UCC/EOC to consider relocating the units based on the above approaches. Only the SAA can approve the relocation and adjustment of the PAPI units.  3.3.7. Even when there are no extreme variations in height along the runway and MOS, you may have to consider leveling the PAPI installation area if there is a variation in elevation of more than 1 foot between the inside PAPI unit (beam center) and the MOS centerline. In this case, consider grading the areas between the  MOS  and  the  PAPI  units  to  bring  the  units  closer  to  the  elevation  of  the MOS centerline. This will provide a flatter reference plane for pilots and helps eliminate disorientation. Contact the Support Chief to address leveling the PAPI location if necessary. 3.3.8. Some airfields that slope up or down from the threshold may have already established  peacetime  adjustments  for  the  threshold  and  glide  path  approach slope.  If  so,  these  peacetime  adjustments  for  approach  lighting  should  be considered  for  use  if  the  MOS  falls  within  the  same  runway  elevation  slopes. For  more  details  on  adjusting  PAPI  locations,  based  on  runway  to  threshold slopes, see UFC 3-535-01, Visual Air Navigation Facilities. 3.3.9.  An  important  point  to  keep  in  mind  is  that  the  PAPI  units  within  the EALS are a two-box L-881 system. Position the centerline of the inside unit 50 to 60-feet from the edge of the runway. Position the outside unit 20 to 30 feet from the inside unit. This separation is the distance between the outside edge of the inside PAPI  unit and the inside edge of the outside PAPI unit. The larger separation increases the useable range of the system.  18 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 Chapter 4 MOS LAYOUT AND MARKING  4.1. Introduction. This chapter provides alternate MAOS marking and striping sequences after attack and may vary from the sequences in T.O. 35E2-6-1 due to amount  of  damage  resulting  from  the  attack.  The  sequences  provided  in  this chapter  are  recommended  to  reduce  layout  and  marking  time  to  the  greatest extent possible. It is assumed pre-attack preparations have been accomplished as described in T.O. 35E2-6-1. The Marking Team Lead will decide if the situation on the ground dictates variation from the sequences in T.O. 35E2-6-1 or from those within this publication. 4.2.  Modified  MOS  Layout  Sequence.  Layout  MOS  and  associated  access taxiways  as  shown  in  Figure  4.1  when  layout  sequence  in  T.O.  35E2-6-1 requires  modification  to  meet  post  attack  ATO  requirements.  The  sequence shown is recommended when the MOS is inundated with damage, repair crews, vehicles, and equipment preventing the layout sequence as described in the T.O. This sequence concentrates on layout of the peripheral locations to provide time for  EOD  and  crater  repair  teams  to  begin  operations  and  progress  down  the MOS  providing  real  estate  needed  to  begin  MOS  layout.  The  layout  crew follows  paths  made  by  the  Foreign  Object  Debris  (FOD)  Team  to  the  MOS threshold and begins MOS layout. Note: If unable to follow the sequence above, move to the next task (if possible) and  go  back  to  the  skipped  task  when  appropriate.  Whenever  the  situation prevents the team from beginning or continuing layout procedures, contact the Support  Chief  to  see  if  crew  members  may  support  the  progress  of  striping, EALS,  or  AAS.  Otherwise,  assist  crater  repair  teams  or  perform  cleanup activities until layout operations can resume.  4.3.  Modified  Marker  Employment  Sequence.  When  damage,  repair  crews, vehicles,  or  equipment  prevent  marker  deployment  sequence  as  described  in T.O. 35E2-6-1, install the RDMs and AAS markers first (ensure UXO have been mitigated  in  the  installation  location  before  installing  markers).  Then,  employ edge markers as situation on the ground permits (Figure 4.2).   19 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                     14 MARCH 2016 Figure 4.1.

This  chapter  provides  an  alternate  blackout  and  striping sequence  after  attack  from  those  found  in  T.O.  35E2-6-1  due  to  amount  of damage that may be experienced from adversaries. The Team Lead will decide if the situation on the ground dictates variation from procedures found in the T.O. or from those found in this publication. 5.1.1. The  sequences  presented  here  are  recommended  to reduce  blackout  and striping time to the greatest extent possible. It is assumed pre-attack preparations have been accomplished as described in T.O. 35E2-6-1.  5.1.2. To meet recovery timelines, striping cannot wait until all teams are out of the  way  as  was  the  case  during  legacy  Rapid  Runway  Repair  operations. The Striping Crew works as it can, where it can. If an area is available for paint, but repairs have not initially cured (~45 minutes for concrete cap or when asphalt caps have reached 150°F), use a hand-wand to paint stripes over repairs.  5.1.3. Normally, striping with white paint should be done first, blackout painting second, and access taxiway striping  with  yellow paint last. However,  with the expected  amount  of  damage  being  repaired  on  the  MOS,  blackout  painting  is likely to be first. Coordinate paint priorities with the Support Chief. 5.2. Blackout Sequence. When possible use the blackout priorities listed in T.O. 35E2-6-1;  however,  when  operations  prevent  using  this  prioritized  list  it  is recommended  to  blackout  markings  in  the  order  shown  in  Figure  5.1.  This sequence  allows  time  for  the  crater  repair  team(s)  to  open  up  MOS  areas  and may vary depending on the situation. The Striping Crew begins by following the path made by the FOD Team to the threshold. Figure 5.1. Alternate Blackout Sequence. 21  DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE  AFTTP 3-32.13                                                1 APRIL 2016 5.3.  Striping  Sequence.  When  the  Capping  Crew  has  completed  all  but  six repairs, the black is cleaned out of the striping machine and loaded with yellow. 5.3.1. Yellow taxiway stripes are painted as available until ten (10) minutes after last crater repair is capped. Then, yellow is cleaned out of the striping machine and  set-up  with  white.  Any  remaining  yellow  painting  not  achieved  due  to pavement repair personnel and equipment interference is completed manually as time permits.  5.3.2.  White  centerline  stripes  are  painted  as  areas  become  available  and continued until complete. 5.3.3.  The  Crew  Lead  informs  the  Support  Chief  when  personnel  have completed their tasks so they may be loaned to other teams as necessary.     JOHN B.

Airfield  Damage  Assessment  Team  (ADAT)—An  airfield  recovery  team, typically  located  in  or  near  the  EOC  and  directed  by  the  Emergency  Support Function  (ESF)  3,  Public  Works  and  Engineering,  that  identifies  and  locates airfield damage and UXO following an attack. Their initial efforts are normally targeted  towards  the  airfield  proper;  but  can  also  be  employed  elsewhere  as deemed  necessary.  The  ADAT  usually  consists  of  one  engineering  technician 25 DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE  AFTTP 3-32.13                                                1 APRIL 2016 and  two  EOD  technicians.  A  CE  member  trained  as  an  EOD  augmentee  may replace  one  of  the  EOD  technicians  when  two  are  unavailable.  The  ADAT should be equipped with an armored vehicle and communications enabling them to report their observations to the MAOS Selection Cell.  approach zone—That end of the runway nearest to the direction from which the final approach is made. In relation to the EALS, the 1,400-foot clear zone before the MOS/runway threshold where approach zone lighting is installed. apron/ramp—A defined area on an airfield intended to accommodate aircraft for the purposes of loading or unloading passengers or cargo, refueling, parking, or maintenance. bidirectional runway—A runway that can support aircraft operations in both directions. Command  and  Control  (C2)—The  exercise  of  authority  and  direction  by  a properly  designated  commander  over  assigned  and  attached  forces  in  the accomplishment of the mission (JP 1-02). C2 functions are performed through an  arrangement  of  personnel,  equipment,  communications,  facilities,  and procedures employed by a commander in planning, directing, coordinating, and controlling forces and operations in the accomplishment of the mission.  contingency—An  emergency  involving  military  forces  caused  by  natural disasters, terrorists, subversives, or by required military operations. Due to the uncertainty  of  the  situation,  contingencies  require  plans,  rapid  response  and special procedures to ensure the safety and readiness of personnel, installations, and equipment. crater—The pit, depression, or cavity formed in the surface of the earth by an explosion. It may range from saucer-shaped to conical, depending largely on the depth of burst. damage assessment—1. The determination of the effects  that attacks have on targets.  2.  (DOD  only)  A  determination  of  the  effect  of  a  compromise  of classified  information  on  national  security.  3.  (AF/CE)  The  process  of identifying and locating damage and unexploded ordnance following an attack. Damage  assessment  activities  generally  are  separated  into  two  categories: airfield pavements and facility/utility. dispersal—Relocation of forces for the purpose of increasing survivability. 26 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 Emergency  Operations  Center  (EOC)—For  the  purposes  of  Air  Force Incident Management System, the EOC is the C2 support elements that directs, monitors,  and  supports  the  installation’s  actions  before,  during,  and  after  an incident.  The  EOC  is  activated  and  recalled  as  necessary  by  the  Installation Commander.  The  EOC  updates  the  Crisis  Action  Team  (CAT)  with  ongoing incident status and seeks support through the CAT when on-scene requirements surpass  the  installation’s  inherent  capability  and  the  installation’s  cumulative capabilities  acquired  through  mutual  aid  agreements.  EOCs  may  also  support multiagency control systems  and joint information activities.  According to the National Response Framework, the EOC is defined as ―“The physical location at  which  the  coordination  of  information  and  resources  to  support  attack response and incident management activities normally takes place. An EOC may be  a  temporary  facility  or  may  be  located  in  a  more  central  or  permanently established  facility,  perhaps  at  a  higher  level  of  organization  within  a jurisdiction.  EOCs  may  be  organized  by  major  functional  disciplines  such  as fire,  law  enforcement,  and  medical  services,  by  jurisdiction  such  as  Federal, State, regional, county, city, tribal, or by some combination thereof”. explosive  ordnance—All  munitions  containing  explosives,  nuclear  fission  or fusion materials, and biological and chemical agents. This includes bombs and warheads; guided and ballistic missiles; artillery, mortar, rocket, and small arms ammunition;  all  mines,  torpedoes  and  depth  charges;  demolition  charges; pyrotechnics; clusters and dispensers; cartridge and propellant actuated devices; electro-explosive devices; clandestine and improvised explosive devices; and all similar or related items or components explosive in nature. explosive  ordnance  disposal  (EOD)—The  detection,  identification,  on-site evaluation, rendering safe, recovery, and final disposal of unexploded explosive ordnance. It may also include explosive ordnance which has become hazardous by damage or deterioration. Facility—A real property entity consisting of one or more of the following: a building, a structure, a utility system, pavement, and underlying land.  Installation  Commander—The  individual  responsible  for  all  operations performed by an installation. MAOS  selection—The  process  of  plotting  damage  and  UXO  locations  on  an airbase  runway  map  and  using  this  information  to  select  a  portion  of  the damaged  runway  which  can  be  repaired  most  quickly  to  support  aircraft operations. 27 DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE  AFTTP 3-32.13                                                1 APRIL 2016 minimum  airfield  operating  surface  (MAOS)—The  combined  requirement for airfield surfaces for both runway and access routes. For example, the MOS is part of the MAOS. Minimum  Airfield  Operating  Surface  Marking  System  (MAOSMS)—The MAOSMS is a visual marking system that provides material and equipment to mark a MOS between 50 and 150 feet wide and between 5,000 and 10,000 feet long. In addition, the system can mark 25 to 50 feet wide taxiways. minimum  operating  strip  (MOS)—1.  A  runway  which  meets  the  minimum requirements  for  operating  assigned  and/or  allocated  aircraft  types  on  a particular  airfield  at  maximum  or  combat  gross  weight.  2.  The  MOS  is  the smallest  amount  of  area  to  be  repaired  to  launch  and  recover  aircraft  after  an attack.  Selection  of  this  MOS  will  depend  upon  mission  requirements,  taxi access, resources available, and estimated time to repair. For fighter aircraft, the typically accepted dimensions are 5,000 feet long by 50 feet wide. mitigation—Activities  designed  to  reduce  or  eliminate  risks  to  persons  or property  or  to  lessen  the  actual  or  potential  effects  or  consequences  of  an incident. Mitigation measures may be implemented prior to, during, or after an incident.  Mitigation  measures  are  often  developed  IAW  lessons  learned  from prior  incidents.  Mitigation  involves  ongoing  actions  to  reduce  exposure  to, probability of, or potential loss from hazards. Measures may include zoning and building  codes,  flood  plain  buyouts,  and  analysis  of  hazard-related  data  to determine where it is safe to build or locate temporary facilities. Mitigation can include efforts to educate governments, businesses, and the public on measures they can take to reduce loss and injury. Obliteration—To  do  away  with  previous  airfield  pavement  markings  by painting over them with black paint. Ordnance—Explosives,  chemicals,  pyrotechnics,  and  similar  stores,  e.g., bombs, guns and ammunition, flares, smoke, or napalm. personnel—Those individuals required in either a military or civilian capacity to accomplish the assigned mission. procedures—Standard,  detailed  steps  that  prescribe  how  to  perform  specific tasks. ramp—see “apron.” 28 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 through impacted  communities  and recovery—The development, coordination, and execution of service- and site-the  reconstitution  of restoration  plans  for government  operations  and  services individual,  private-sector, nongovernmental, and public assistance programs that: identify needs and define resources; provide housing and promote restoration; address long-term care and treatment  of  affected  persons;  implement  additional  measures  for  community restoration;  incorporate  mitigation  measures  and  techniques,  as  feasible; evaluate  the  incident  to  identify  lessons  learned;  and  develop  initiatives  to mitigate the effects of future incidents. RED HORSE—Air Force units wartime-structured to provide a heavy engineer capability  that  are  mobile,  rapidly  deployable,  and  largely  self-sufficient  for limited periods of time. render  safe  procedures—The  portion  of  the  explosive  ordnance  disposal procedures  involving  the  application  of  special  explosive  ordnance  disposal methods and tools to provide for the interruption of functions or separation of essential  components  of  unexploded  explosive  ordnance to  prevent  an unacceptable detonation. Response—Activities that address the short-term, direct effects of an incident. Response includes immediate actions to save lives, protect property, and  meet basic  human  needs.  Response  also  includes  the  execution  of  emergency operations plans and of incident mitigation activities designed to limit the loss of life,  personal  injury,  property  damage,  and  other  unfavorable  outcomes.  As indicated by the situation, response activities include: applying intelligence and other information to lessen the effects or consequences of an incident; increased security operations; continuing investigations into the nature and source of the threat; ongoing public health and agricultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation or quarantine; and specific law enforcement operations aimed at preempting, interdicting or disrupting illegal activity and apprehending actual perpetrators and bringing them to justice. runway—A defined rectangular area of an airfield, prepared for the landing and takeoff  run  of  aircraft  along  its  length.  A  runway  is  measured  from  the  outer edge of the thresholds from one end of the runway to the others. The width of the  runway  is  typically  measured  from  the  outer  edge  of  the  load-bearing pavement  on  one  side  to  the  outer  edge  of  the  load-bearing  pavement  on  the other side. In some cases the runway may be measured from the outside edge of the runway marking line on one side to the outside edge of the marking line on 29 DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE  AFTTP 3-32.13                                                1 APRIL 2016 the other side and any remaining load bearing pavement is considered shoulder. runway designation—A two-digit number that designates the magnetic heading of a runway.  As  viewed from an inbound aircraft,  measure the heading of the runway centerline clockwise from magnetic north. Round the compass reading to  the  nearest  10°,  and  drop  the  last  digit  (a  zero).  For  example,  when  the magnetic  heading  of  a  runway/MOS  is  068°,  the  runway  designation  is  07 (round  068  to  070  and  drop  the  last  digit).  When  viewed  from  the  opposite direction,  consider  the  pavement  a  separate  runway,  and  its  designation  is  25 (180° in the opposite direction). Painted designations are  normally on ends of runways, but not on a MOS. Runway  Reference  Point  (RRP)—The  RRP  is  the  point  on  the  runway centerline where the PAPI visual glide path intersects the runway. runway threshold—A line perpendicular to the runway centerline designating the beginning of that portion of a runway usable for landing. Green lights mark the threshold end. When the threshold of a runway is co-located with the end of the opposite runway, the threshold/end lights have a split lens with green on one side and red on the other. Senior Airfield Authority (SAA)—An individual designated/appointed by the component  responsible  for  airfield  operations  at  direction  of  the  Joint  Force Commander.  The  SAA  is  responsible  for  control,  priorities,  operation  and maintenance  of  an  airfield  to  include  runways,  associated  taxiways,  parking ramps, land, and facilities whose proximity affect airfield operations. taxiway—A  specially-prepared  or  designated  path  on  an  airfield  or  heliport, other  than  apron  areas,  on  which  aircraft  move  under  their  own  power  to  and from landing, takeoff, service, and parking areas. techniques—Non-prescriptive  ways  or  methods  use  to  perform  missions, functions, or tasks. threat—An indication of possible violence, harm, or danger. unexploded explosive ordnance (UXO)—Explosive ordnance which has been primed,  fuzed,  armed,  or  otherwise  prepared  for  action,  and  which  has  been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard  to  operations,  installations,  personnel,  or  material,  and  remains unexploded either by malfunction or design. 30 AFTTP 3-32.13                                                      14 MARCH 2016 unidirectional  runway—A  condition  where,  for  whatever  reason,  aircraft takeoff  and  land  on  the  runway  in  only  one  direction.  If  that  condition  is  not temporary,  approach  lights  and  strobes  are  required  only  at  the  approach  end, and place RDMs and lights only on the right side of the runway.   31  AFTTP 3-32.13 DRAFT—NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION OR COMPLIANCE                                                1 APRIL 2016 Attachment 2 MAOSMS Layout and MOS Planning Checklist  Table A2.1.
