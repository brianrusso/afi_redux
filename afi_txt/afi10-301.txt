More  specifically,  ANGUS  units  establish  and  maintain  effective  safety and  training  programs  that  are  compatible  with  those  of  the  gaining  commands  (T-2).  In addition, NGB provides gaining commands  with copies of applicable training program policies and  publications (T-2). The NGB, in coordination with ANGUS units, investigates and reports mishaps as prescribed in appropriate USAF publications (T-2).  DELETE  PARAGRAPHS  5  AND  6.
