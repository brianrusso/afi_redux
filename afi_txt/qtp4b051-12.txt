Given a source of ionizing radiation and installation inventory, determine hazards presented to workers and general public successfully completing all checklist items with limited trainer assistance. Notes: Identifying sources of ionizing radiation typically fall on the installation radiation safety officer (IRSO), and requires a technician to do no more than consult the radioactive material inventory maintained by the IRSO.  Under some circumstances a technician may be required to identify new hazards that will need to be reported to the IRSO.  New sources may be reported from a shop supervisor, or identified during routine or special surveillance.  The purpose of this objective is not to measure radiation levels, as that is performed elsewhere.  Instead it is meant to determine if radiation is present and how it is produced; either from radiactive material, such as Cs-137, or from another process, such is in an an x-ray tube head.       1 AFQTP 4B051-12                                                Journeyman Training Guide:  Ionizing Radiation  1.

Record all pertinent information if necessary.3  4.  Determine potential population at risk.4    LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:     NOTES:  1.  Devices containing radioactive material should be labeled with radioactive sticker and isotope contained within.  Serial number of source and equipment will be recorded to compare to the inventory.  2.  X-ray tubes should be labeled with a radiation sticker, if KvP and mA settings are not labeled on machince, other sources of intel should be used, such as an interview with the operator.  3.  If device/material is not listed on the installation inventory, record all pertinent information to report to IRSO.  This includes, but is not limited to: •  Manufacturer •  Model •  Serial number of device •  Source isotope, activity, and date activity was measured •  Serial number of radiation source (if applicable) •  Machine parameters (KvP, mA, duration of exposure) (if applicable) •  Using organization •  Location: Bldg #, Room # for both use and storage areas (if different)  4.  Take in to consideration operators/users, adjacent rooms and areas, and if area is accessible by the general public.  This is necessary when determining priority for special surveillance.    2 AFQTP 4B051-12                                                Journeyman Training Guide:  Ionizing Radiation TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS                   STS Line Item 4.9.2.6:  Identify radiological/nuclear hazards 1.

Select appropriate radiation detection equipment.1 2.  Record diagram of radiation storage area, including all adjacent areas.2 3.  Take background measurements in a radiation-free area near RAM storage area. 4.  Measure gamma/x-ray radiation exposure rate using ion chamber.3 5.  Subtract background readings from readings at each location (in order to obtain net exposure rates). 6.  Determine appropriate Occupancy Factor (OF) for each measurement point.4 7.  Calculate estimated annual exposure for each measurement point.5 8.  Compare measurements and calculated values to appropriate standards. 9.  Prepare survey documentation.6 10.  Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent), as applicable.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  7                    Journeyman Training Guide:  Ionizing Radiation AFQTP 4B051-12                             NOTES: 1.  Refer to the Radiation Detection Instrument Selection Guide (TABLE 6-19) found on page 71 of BGIR 2005 for instrument selection assistance.  In addition, subtasks to this step should include: •  Check battery on selected equipment. •  Perform “bump check” on selected equipment. •  Ensure calibration date on selected equipment is current.  • •  2.  Subtasks to this step should include: Identify all locations where readings will be taken. Identify adjacent areas where workers/general public (GP) may be present (hallways, offices, parking lots, doorways 3.  Normally, average readings should be taken. Readings may be taken in exposure rate mode or cumulative exposure mode over a period of time. Cumulative exposure may be preferable when readings fluctuate greatly. In addition, ion chambers usually read in units of microroentgen or milliroentgen per hour. 1 R/hr of radiation exposure equals approximately 1 rem/hr of gamma or x-ray radiation dose.  Take measurement 30 cm (12 inches) from any surface displaying radiation penetration.  Include key locations within area and surrounding areas in order to assess worker and GP exposures.  •  Refer to AFIOH Report IOH-SD-BR-SR-2005-0004, Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to Ionizing Radiation If more reliable source of occupancy data is available, it may be used instead of the OF as long as it is documented and defensible.  4.  5.  The projected annual general public dose rate is calculated using the following formula: This value is then compared to the 100 mrem/yr standard for the general public.  For occupational exposure, the dose equivalent is calculated as follows: reading�𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇ℎ𝑟𝑟� ×365 �𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟 � ×8 �ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑� × OF ×� 1𝑚𝑚𝜇𝜇reading𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇ℎ𝑟𝑟 × 2000ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟  ×fraction 𝑜𝑜𝑟𝑟 OF × 1𝑚𝑚𝜇𝜇1000𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇� = 𝑚𝑚𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟  1000𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇= 𝑚𝑚𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑟  This value is then compared to the 5 rem/yr standard for the radiation workers.         6.   Legally defensible documentation must be accurately reported and should contain (at a minimum) the following: Information on the RAM or radiation producing services being used/stored. Instruments used for the survey (with serial number and calibration specifications). Individual(s) conducting the survey. 1.  Diagram of the RAM storage/use area (with details on adjacent areas). 2. 3. 4. 5.  AF permit number (if applicable). 6.

Explain if and why the filter paper must be wet or dry before taking a radiological swipe?  A:  It is now recommended that swipe samples should be taken wet by adding a few drops of deionized water (DI) to dampen the swipe/swab. Previously, guidance was given that swipe samples should be taken using a dry swipe. Recent studies have demonstrated that this results in a very low collection efficiency of removable activity, as low as 10%. It has been shown that wet swipes have a much higher efficiency of up to 90%. Thus, to obtain more representative samples, wet swipes are now recommended.

Notes: *The intent of this training is to accurately perform analysis of results collected by the ADM-300 beta probe to obtain surface activity in dpm/100cm2. The concepts provided here carry over to other probes and equipment with minimal effort.  Correctly analyzing swipe samples utilizing efficiency of the swipe and probe used provides invaluable information prior to having a sample analyzed by the USAFSAM radioanalytical  laboratory.  The BE Guide to Ionizing Radiation provides efficiency tables for the BP-100 in Figure B-1.  The chart of nuclides at www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart can be used to determine beta particle energy. Once the isotope of concern is selected, select “decay radiation”  under the chart and find the ‘End-point energy’ (keV) with the highest ‘Intensity’ (from all ‘Beta’ data sets) use that value (keV)” in table B-1 to find the BP-100 efficiency.   If the swipe is taken over a 100cm2 area, the calculation below will give activity (dpm) per 100cm2, adjustments must be made if a greater area is swiped, or if surface measurements are taken directly with the probe.  100cm2 swipe: 𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚100𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚2=(𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚100𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚2=�𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−𝑏𝑏𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑∗𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑)/100𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚2 𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−𝑏𝑏𝑑𝑑𝑐𝑐𝑏𝑏𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑜𝑜𝑐𝑐 𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑∗𝑑𝑑𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚 𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑒𝑚𝑚𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑑𝑑�/100𝑐𝑐𝑚𝑚2 0.15526  Direct measurement using BP-100:   AFQTP 4B051-12                                                  Journeyman Training Guide:  Ionizing Radiation TASK STEPS   1.

One of the key pieces of information needed to analyze and control radioactive material, is the mode of decay and half-life of the isotope of concern.   While Bioenvironmental Engineering Journeymen are not expected to memorize every isotope and its associated information, they should be able to quickly and accurately determine the information using official references such as the chart of nuclides published by the Department of Energy at www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart. Using the chart is relatively simple:  The vertical axis is the number of protons (Z number), the horizontal axis is the number of neutrons.  Any isotope encountered in the Air Force can be located on the chart.  Once the isotope of concern is selected, the half-life and decay mode are displayed on the bottom of the screen.
