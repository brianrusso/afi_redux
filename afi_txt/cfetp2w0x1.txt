This  CFETP  is  a  comprehensive  education  and  training  document  that  identifies  2W0X1 education  and  training  requirements,  training  support  resources,  and  minimum  core  task requirements for the Munitions Systems specialty. The CFETP provides munitions personnel a clear career path to success incorporating all aspects of career field training. NOTE: Munitions managers should utilize Part II to support duty position qualification training for civilian personnel occupying associated munitions positions.   2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the 2W0X1 AFSC.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty and will be maintained  as  part  of  the  work  center  Master Training  Plan  (MTP).    Section  A  explains  how everyone will use the plan. Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities,  training  strategies,  and  career  field  path.  Section  C  associates  each  level  with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other). Section D indicates resource constraints (i.e. funds, manpower, equipment, facilities). Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through SMSgt and other SNCOs as required by the AFCFM.  2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A: identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, TRs to support training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core  task  and  correspondence  course  requirements.  Section  B:  contains  the  COL  and  training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements. Section C: identifies available support materials. An example is a Qualification Training Package, which may be  developed  to  support  proficiency  training;  Section  D  identifies  a  training  course  index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training. Included here are both mandatory  and  optional  courses;  Section  E  identifies  MAJCOM  unique  training  requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs. At  unit  level,  supervisors  and  trainers  will  use  Part  II  to  identify,  plan,  and  conduct  training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure munitions systems personnel (military and civilian)  receive  effective  and  efficient  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  their  career development.      	ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced Training (AT).

All questions or change recommendations regarding the CFETP will be routed through the respective MFM for discussion at the 2W0X1 U&TW.    SECTION B – CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION  B1.  Specialty Descriptions. The source document for Specialty Descriptions is the Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory (AFECD) available online, in myPERS.  URL below: https://mypers.af.mil/  In the upper right side, just above Advanced Search, type in AFECD.  When the next page opens, click on the most recent AFECD.  B1.1.  Specialty Summary.  Refer to the most current AFECD Part I, Section II, paragraph 1 of the 2W0 career field.    B1.2.  Duties and Responsibilities.  Refer to most current AFECD Part I, Section II, paragraph 2 of the 2W0 career field.  B2.  Skill Level and Career Progression. Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission. It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.  B2.1.  Apprentice Level (3). Upon completion of the  Munitions Systems Apprentice course, trainees will work with a trainer to enhance their knowledge and skills. They will use the 2W051 Career Development Course (CDC) and Task Qualification Training identified in the STS, AFJQS, MAJCOM, and base level-identified training programs to progress within the AFSC.  CDCs may be  completed  in  any  sequence.  Supervisors  determine  which  CDC  set  or  volume  an  upgrade Airman  will  enroll.  2W051A  encompasses  a  generalized  approach  to  ‘munitions  systems’ organization structure and processes and materiel; while 2W051B generally references production techniques, equipment, and specific munitions items. It is highly encouraged that Airmen complete the 5-skill level CDC within one year in order to be upgraded within prescribed and anticipated timelines. Once qualified on a task, a 2W031 may perform the task unsupervised, except when prohibited by safety or security requirements. In addition, 2W031 personnel are encouraged to continue  their  education  towards  completing  a  Community  College  of  the  Air  Force  (CCAF) degree.    B2.2.    Journeyman  Level  (5).    Experience  is  mandatory  in  performing  functions  such  as warehousing, accounting, mechanical assembly, electronics, transportation of munitions, use of hand tools, and preparing and maintaining documentation and records for inventory management actions involving manual or automated systems or both.  Once upgraded to the 5-skill level, a Journeyman  will  enter  into  experience-based  career-broadening  continuation  training.  2W051 personnel  will  be  assigned  positions  commensurate  with  their  rank,  abilities,  and  experience. Individuals will use their Career Development Course (CDC) to prepare for Weighted Airman Promotion  System  (WAPS)  testing.  2W051  personnel  are  highly  encouraged  to  consider continuing their education towards the award of a  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.    Journeyman  that  meet  the  minimum  upgrade  and  rank  requirements  will  pursue qualification  in  all  7-level  core  tasks  identified  in  the  CFETP,  tasks  identified  in  the  Master Training  Plan  (MTP)  as  2W071  upgrade  tasks  (UGT)  for  the  duty  position,  and  attend AFCOMAC's  Combat  Ammunition  Planning  and  Production  (CAPP)  course  prior  to  being awarded  a  7-skill  level.  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentees  (IMA)  may  attend  AFCOMAC CAPP if vacancies are available.  B2.3. Craftsman Level (7). Qualification in and possession of AFSC 2W051. Also, experience is mandatory  in  supervising  or  performing  functions  such  as  receipting,  identifying,  inspecting, storing,  reconditioning,  issuing,  delivering,  maintaining,  testing,  and  assembling  guided  and unguided  munitions;  or  preparing  and  maintaining  documentation  and  records  for  inventory management  actions.    Craftsmen  can  expect  to  fill  various  supervisory  positions  within  an organization. They may also be assigned to work in staff positions at squadron, group, wing, or MAJCOM  levels.  Our  7-skill  level  munitions  personnel  are  highly  encouraged  to  continue academic educational pursuits through CCAF, or higher, degree programs.   B2.4.    Superintendent  Level  (9).  Qualification  in  and  possession  of  AFSC  2W071.  Also, experience is mandatory in managing functions such as accountable munitions material operations; munitions  storage,  maintenance,  and  assembly  functions;  munitions  inspection;  equipment maintenance; line delivery and handling functions; computing levels; automated data processing; or maintaining munitions material management accounts.  9-skill level munitions managers can be expected to fill supervisory and management positions within an organization. They should also strive to gain experience in all major functional divisions of the Munitions Storage Area commonly referred to as Systems, Materiel and Production, and should seek additional training in budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management through continuing education programs. They may also be assigned to work in staff positions at squadron, group, wing, or command levels. IMA munitions  personnel  may  attend  the  AFCOMAC  CAPP  course  if  vacancies  are  available.  Completion of CCAF degree is mandatory for promotion to SMSgt.  B2.4.1 AFCOMAC. SMSgt’s and CMSgt’s are listed on an AFCOMAC CAPP roster in order to accurately track and schedule senior enlisted members for attendance for these key ranks. These selected individuals are expected to attend AFCOMAC CAPP when scheduled in order to ensure proper class structure and appropriate training of all attendees is accomplished.  B3.  Training Decisions. Training decisions are made during Utilization and Training Workshops (U&TW). Functional managers utilize survey data in the decision making process. Supervisors must  understand  the  importance  of  surveys  and  ensure  completion  in  a  timely  manner.  The AFCFM, in conjunction with MFMs and Subject Matter Experts (SME), work with curriculum developers  from  the  363d  Training  Squadron,  Sheppard  AFB,  to  develop  munitions  systems training processes. Changes to the process, including this CFETP, the STS, AFJQS, CDCs, and formal course content, will be processed via local 2W0X1 supervision and forwarded to the MFM for coordination and consideration. The MFMs forward their recommendation to the CFM for coordination and approval.  Note: The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 2W0X1 AFSC. The spectrum includes a strategy for when,  where,  and  how  to  meet  the  training  requirements.  The  strategy  is  apparent  and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  Note:    Section  20  (Vehicles)  will  remain  in the  CFETP  to  ensure  technical  school  trainees receive orientation training with primary vehicles.  However, there is no requirement to sign off personnel  in  this  section  at  an  operating  base;  this  is  accomplished  through  the  Vehicle Licensing process.   B3.1.  Initial  Skills.  There  are  currently  no  new  initial  skills  requirements  this  area  is reserved.  B3.2.  5-Level Upgrade Requirements. 8.5.4.  B3.3.  7-Level  Upgrade  Requirements.  There  are  currently  no  new  initial  skills requirements this area is reserved.  B3.4.  9-Level  Upgrade  Requirements.  There  are  currently  no  new  initial  skills requirements this area is reserved.  B4.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF is one of several federally chartered degree-granting institutions; however, it is the only 2-year institution exclusively serving military enlisted personnel.
