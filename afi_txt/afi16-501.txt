DoD PPBE Process.  31.1.  Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) Process.  The PPBE system isthe DoD resource management process with four interrelated phases consistent with national securityobjectives, policies, and strategies.  Its purpose is to identify capability requirements (Planning), andmatch them with resource requirements (Programming), translate them into budget proposals (Bud-geting), and evaluate spending (Execution) to determine how well the desired capabilities will beachieved.  The Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) provides centralized policy direction throughout thefour phases, while delegating program development, execution authority, and responsibility to Ser-vices and DoD agencies.   1.1.1.  MID 913 directed a significant change to the existing PPBS process.  Beginning with theFY04 Program Objective Memorandum, Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Program Anal-ysis and Evaluation (PA&E) implemented a 4-year process comprised of two 2-year planning,programming, budgeting, and execution cycles.  The table below describes the details of each ofthe four years dealt with in 2-year cycles. Table 1.

Planning. The first phase of the PPBE process, planning, begins as a DoD function.  It is a visionof the future with broad strategies and plans.  The planning phase encompasses long-range guidanceout to 20-years, long-range objectives out to 10-years, and mid-term planning out to 6-years.Long-range guidance and objectives are generated to define the major force modernization and invest-ment requirements for each DoD component.  The Strategic Planning Guidance (SPG) and the JointProgramming Guidance (JPG) have replaced the Defense Planning Guidance and guide the mid-termplanning period.  Both documents are published every other year, but the SPG may be published annu-ally at the discretion of the SECDEF. 4AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 20061.2.1.  The SPG is designed to provide focused, timely, strategic direction to resource allocationdecisions of the DoD.  The priorities in the SPG help provide the common analytical and program-matic course to build the joint capabilities needed to overcome the diverse challenges of thefuture. 1.2.2.  The JPG conveys the SECDEF’s decisions on issues developed through the Enhanced Plan-ning Process (EPP) and on other matters of high priority.  The guidance is fiscally constrained,executable, and mandatory.  Implementation must be consistent with strategic direction and prior-ities set forth in the SPG. 1.3.  Programming. The second phase of the PPBE process, programming, applies constraints to theOSD vision developed in the planning phase.  Programming is primarily a military department/agencyfunction.  Programming translates DoD guidance into action, balances allocation of resources to plans(requirements), organizes requirements into packages (programs), and prioritizes programs based oncapabilities/risks. 1.3.1.  The Services’ Program Objective Memorandum (POM) is developed within the fiscal con-straints set forth by the administration.  These fiscal constraints guide the Services to makechoices to meet the requirements of the SPG and JPG.  The POM covers the Future Years DefenseProgram (FYDP).  In even-numbered years, the FYDP covers six years, as opposed to five yearsin odd-numbered years.  Services then submit their POM to the OSD for review and compliancewith directives and guidance. 1.3.2.  OSD Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) is responsible for the Program Reviewcycle and ensures the programs and corresponding resources are consistent with the objectives ofthe SECDEF and the President.  PA&E issues Program Decision Memorandums (PDMs) to theServices highlighting OSD changes to any of the programs. 1.4.  Budgeting. The third phase of the PPBE process, budgeting, involves the formulation and con-trol of near-term resource requirements, allocation, and use, based on the results of the planning andprogramming efforts.  The budget is developed from the POM, as modified by the PDMs.  The budgetphase takes the first two resource years of the POM and prepares the requirements for presentation toOSD and Congress. 1.4.1.  Budget Review is OSD’s opportunity to ensure programs are correctly costed and dollarsare budgeted against them within fiscal management rules and policies.   1.4.2.  OSD Comptroller (OSD (C)) is responsible for the Budget Review cycle and issues Pro-gram Budget Decisions (PBDs) highlighting proposed changes to the Services’ budgets. 1.4.3.  In this process there is some opportunity for the programs to be adjusted to better meetcapability requirements before submittal to Congress.  Services may provide reclamas to draftPBDs, and signed PBDs that contain unacceptable issues and may be appealed with OSD vianegotiation or may be designated major budget issues. 1.5.  Management Initiative Decision (MID) 913. MID 913 makes the Program Review and BudgetReview concurrent under what is now called the Program Budget Review (PBR). Under MID 913, thePDM and PBD cycles both enact changes to Service’s POMs.  The Budget Estimate Submission(BES) phase is no longer independent.   1.6.  Execution. The final phase of the PPBE process is the execution of the program-budget.  Execu-tion is the process by which the performance of the planning, programming, and budgeting phases areAFI16-501   15 AUGUST 20065translated into warfighter capability.  IAW MID 910, the effectiveness of the PPBE must be measuredand validated with metrics.   2.  Air Force PPBE Process.  2.1.  Goal. The goal of the Air Force PPBE process is to provide the best implementation and execu-tion of the defense objectives in support of our national goals established by the President and cap-tured by the SECDEF in the SPG/JPG and other guidance/documents.   2.2.  Headquarters Air Force Responsibilities:  2.2.1.  Prepares inputs for SPG/JPG.  Develops and submits the Air Force POM to OSD.  Devel-ops and submits the Air Force PB to OSD and distributes program documents to the ProgrammingAgencies. 2.2.2.  Implements OSD program directives and guidance during the PBR and ensures the OSDapproved program is reflected in the FYDP. 2.2.3.  Ensures appropriate amendments to program guidance and directives are interpreted,implemented, and direction is provided to Programming Agencies. 2.2.4.  Makes necessary changes within the range of HQ USAF approval authority, funding, andmanpower. 2.2.5.  Ensures requests for program changes initiated within HQ USAF or submitted by the Pro-gramming Agencies are processed IAW procedures defined in Attachment 3. 2.2.6.  Distributes Combatant Commander’s (COCOM) Integrated Priority Lists (IPL) to planningand programming agencies. 2.3.  Programming Agencies Responsibilities : 2.3.1.  Comply with program guidance issued by OSD and HQ USAF. 2.3.2.  Submit program data and briefings according to HQ USAF schedule and direction. 2.3.3.  Coordinate with the appropriate MAJCOM (see table below) to translate COCOM’s capa-bility requirements into programmatic terms, to include program elements and required funding. 6AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006Table 2.

Programming Agencies will provide offsets for allcosts to include budget and execution years and the FYDP. 2.3.7.  Implement the approved Air Force program as directed. 2.4.  Combatant Commander Responsibilities:  2.4.1.  Transmit capability requirements through the appropriate MAJCOM/Component.  TheMAJCOM/Component will vet those requirements internally and highlight the results in theirPOM briefings to the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). 2.4.2.  Coordinate with MAJCOMs to translate capability requirements into programmatic terms,to include program elements and required funding. 2.4.3.  Use the vetting process to identify requirements more appropriately funded by another Ser-vice, and forward for inclusion in the other Service’s POM. 2.5.  Executive Agent Responsibilities. 2.5.1.  HAF and programming agencies will meet the requirements of the agencies and programswhere the Air Force is identified as the Executive Agent.  This responsibility will be highlightedthroughout the POM build process. 3.  Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS).  3.1.  Overview. The Air Force implements the PPBE process through the AFCS.  The strength of theAFCS (see Figure 1.) is the consistency of reviews tied to successive evaluation by grade level andexperience within the functional staff (i.e. SAF/FM, AF/A3, AF/A4, etc.).  It is not intended to sup-plant the functional staff but to enhance it and provide balance when making resource allocation deci-AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 20067sions.  The functional staff continues to conduct its functional business and reviews.  The AFCSincreases overall management effectiveness by applying cross-functional judgment, experience, andanalysis to program adjustments in a resource limited environment. 3.1.1.  The AFCS enables Air Force transformation by supporting a capabilities-based resourceallocation program.  The AFCS presents the best courses of action to the Secretary of the AirForce (SECAF) and Chief of Staff of the Air Force (CSAF) for making resource-based decisions.The top-down deliberative elements of the AFCS are the Air Force Council (AFC), the Air ForceBoard (AFB), the Air Force Group (AFG), and the 13 Mission and Mission Support Panels.  TheAFCS is guided by the Air Force Concepts of Operations (AF CONOPS) (Global Mobility, Glo-bal Persistent Attack, Global Strike, Homeland Security, Nuclear Response, Space and Command,Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR),and Agile Combat Support) and the Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment (CRRA) processinforms investment decisions and the development of the Air Force POM. 3.1.2.  The ultimate goals of the AFCS are to:  provide a multifunctional, cross-staff perspectiveon all key Air Force programs; enhance responsiveness to program issues; support corporate deci-sion-making through interaction with Mission/Mission Support Panels; and cut across organiza-tional barriers to improve the corporate decision-making process. 3.1.3.  Process Timing is on a calendar year schedule.  Refer to Air Force POM PreparationInstruction (PPI) and DoD Instruction 7045.7 for calendar of events. 3.2.  Air Force Council (AFC). The AFC is the senior forum for cross-functional consideration ofthe most critical Air Force issues.  The AFC reviews and evaluates Air Force objectives, policies,plans, programs, budgets, and studies to make timely recommendations to the SECAF and CSAF.The AFC also provides expeditious Deputy Chiefs of Staff (DCS)-level coordination on significant,urgent, and complex issues to ensure that Air Force plans, polices, and programs comply with JointChiefs of Staff (JCS), OSD, and national objectives.  The AFC returns issues to the Air Force Board(AFB) for further study.  The AFC is chaired by the AF/CV, and membership consists of Air Staff andSecretariat Principals (3-star and civilian equivalent with some selected 2-star members). 8AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006Figure 1.  The Air Force Corporate Structure Council membership is as follows: HQ USAF:  CVA | A1 | A2 | A3/5 | A4/7 | A8 | A9 | HC | JA | RE | SE | SG | ST | TE SAF:  AA | AQ | CM | FM | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | MR | SB | XC | US(D) | NGB  Advisory members include: AF/A8P | AF/CCC | AF/CVE | AF/CVAS | AF/CVAE | AF/CX | SAF/AG | SAF/FMB 3.2.1.  The Special Programs Oversight Committee (SPOC) is a separate and distinct decisionmaking body from the AFC.  It is the Senior Air Force review committee for oversight of resourceallocation, management, security, and execution of all Air Force special access programs (SAPs),excluding the National Foreign Intelligence Program.  The SPOC is chaired by the SECAF (seeFigure 1.).  3.3.  Air Force Board (AFB). The AFB provides flag-level (1-2 star and civilian equivalent) review,evaluation, and recommendations within the same broad categories as the AFC.  Members areselected by their AFC counterpart and are responsible for preparing their principal for AFC meetings.Additional members of the AFB are advisory and represent programs with Air Force Total ObligationAuthority (TOA) and a combination of unique functional expertise.  Additionally, panel chairs andAFI16-501   15 AUGUST 20069AF CONOPS Champions are present, each representing mission and functional areas of Air Forceexpertise.  Topics should be limited to important matters requiring corporate consideration and reso-lution.  Its ultimate strength lies in its broad representative span that allows thorough vetting of issuesbefore elevating the most critical issues to the AFC.  Additionally, the AFB directs the focus of theAFG in resolving issues, refines AFG developed recommendations for submission to the AFC, andexpedites Directorate-level coordination on significant issues.  The AFB is chaired by Director of Pro-grams, HQ USAF/A8P, with the Associate Director as his back up, and co-chaired by Deputy Assis-tant Secretary (Financial Management) (SAF/FMB), on non-budget issues.  During budgetformulation and execution, and during the Budget Review cycle, it is chaired by SAF/FMB. Board membership includes representatives from: HQ USAF:  A1 | A2 | A3/5 | A4/7 | A8 | A9 | HC | JA | RE | SG | TE SAF:  AA | AG | AQ | FM | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | PA | XC | USA | ANG Advisory members include: AF/A1M | AF/A7C | AF/A8X  3.3.1.  The Investment Budget Review Committee (IBRC) chaired by SAF/FMBI (GeneralOfficer equivalent), assists the AFC/AFB in evaluating investment appropriations and accounts inthe year of execution, while the Operating Budget Review Committee (OBRC) chaired by SAF/FMBO (General Officer equivalent) assists in evaluating the program budgeting and execution ofthe Operations and Maintenance (O&M) appropriation in the year of execution (see Figure 1.). 3.4.  Air Force Group (AFG). The AFG provides the AFB and senior-level leadership (O-6 andcivilian equivalents) a forum for initial corporate review and evaluation on appropriate issues withinthe same broad categories as both the AFB and AFC.  The AFG is the first level of the AFCS that inte-grates the Air Force mission, mission support areas, and capabilities into a balanced Air Force pro-gram.  Members are selected by their AFB counterpart or two-letter sponsors and are responsible forpreparing their principal for AFB or AFC meetings.  Its ultimate strength lies in its broad representa-tive span that allows thorough vetting of issues before being elevated to the AFB or AFC for reviewand deliberation.  Like the AFB and AFC, the AFG provides a forum for expeditious Division-levelcoordination on significant issues. 3.4.1.  The AFG is chaired by AF/A8P Deputy except for purposes of budget formulation and exe-cution to include the Budget Estimate Submission (BES), Budget Review (BR), and the Presi-dent’s Budget (PB) when it is chaired by SAF/FMBP.  Additionally, Panel Chairs and AFCONOPS Champions are present during AFG meetings.  Panel briefs to the AFG require mini-mum of four briefer support chairs (POC + 3 AOs).  AFG include representatives from: HQ USAF:  A1 | A1M | A1S | A2 | A3/5 | A3O | A3S | A4P | A7C | A7S | A8F | A8P | A8X | A9R| HC | JA | RE | SG | TE SAF:  AA | AG | AQ | FM | FMC | GC | IA | IE | IG | LL | PA | USA | ANG | XC 3.4.2.  The five Mission and nine Mission Support Panels are the Air Force centers of expertise fortheir areas, and they are the first level of corporate deliberation in the AFCS.  The Panels serve asthe initial point of entry for issues arising from the Program Element Monitors (PEMs), IntegratedProcess Team (IPT), MAJCOMS, FOAs, or DRUs that require AFCS review.  Panels review anddevelop options for presentation to the AFG. 10AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 20063.4.3.  The Special Programs Review Group (SPRG) serves as the working-level advisory panelresponsible for integration of requirements and allocation of resources across the SAP portfolio.The SPRG matches resources to requirements and makes recommendations to the SPOC Execu-tive Secretary for presentation to the SPOC.  The SPRG is chaired by SAF/AQL and co-chaired byAF/A8PE (see Figure 1.).  3.4.4.  In addition to permanent SAF/FMB representation on each mission and mission supportpanel, the AFCS requires SAF/FMB appropriations manager coordination on each approved Dis-connect (D), Initiative (I), or Offset (O).  Appropriation manager cooperation at the panel levelensures proper budget level detail review and develops information requirements for the creationof J-Book submissions.  An established working relationship between the panels and the appropri-ation managers ensures funding ramps are avoided when possible and explained to the properlevel of fidelity, when required for mission needs.  This relationship also protects AFCS intentwhen last minute, undistributed cuts emerge during the fall review.  Appropriation managers, withthe help of the panels, can assist in the distribution and programmatic assessment on non-program-matic cuts. Panel Chairs and AF CONOPS Champions are members of the IBRC and OBRC pro-cesses, as well. 3.5.  AF Concept of Operations (CONOPS) Champions. The AF CONOPS Champions assess theportfolio of Air Force through the Integrated Capabilities Review and Risk Assessments (CRRA) pro-cess and evaluate the risk of Panel proposals and issues to the execution of the AF CONOPS.Together, the Panels and AF CONOPS Champions represent a body of highly qualified experts in pro-gram portfolios that align with capability requirements defined by the AF CONOPS and capabilityobjectives identified through the CRRA process.  The Panel structure and organizational chairman-ship is as follows:  MISSION PANELSAir SuperiorityGlobal AttackInformation SuperiorityGlobal MobilitySpace Superiority     CHAIR HQ USAF/A8PC HQ USAF/ A8PC HQ USAF/ A8PI HQ USAF/ A8PM HQ USAF/ A8PS MISSION SUPPORT PANELPersonnel & TrainingInstallation SupportLogisticsResearch, Development, Test and EvaluationCommunications & Information (CI)Special Access Required (SAR)National Intelligence Programs (NIP)Competitive Sourcing and PrivatizationInnovation       CHAIR HQ USAF/A1MT HQ USAF/A4PE HQ USAF/A4PE SAF/AQXR SAF/XCXRC SAF/AQL & HQ USAF/A8PE HQ USAF/A2XR HQ USAF/A1MS SAF/XCOI AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 200611NOTE: Special Access Required (SAR) panel, AF/A8PE-SAR, serves as the SPRG representative to theAF Board and Air Force Group (see Figure 1.).  3.6.  Program Element (PE). Each Air Force PE is assigned a single PEM to act as the focal point forthat PE.  A PEM is usually assigned from within the Secretariat or Air Staff, based on the office of pri-mary responsibility (OPR) for that PE.  HQ AF/A8PE is the approval authority and the AF point ofcontact for all PE actions.  PE documentation is maintained in the AF FYDP Structure ManagementSystem (AF FSMS).  PEMs establish accounts in this web based system and are the AF POC for allPE actions.  PEMs are primary advocates for their PEs, addressing issues and coordinating functionalconcerns across various staffs.  Air Staff PEMs are expected to be the subject matter expert at the AirStaff level on their PEs.  In conjunction with the Mission/Mission Support Panels, they prepare andupdate various planning, programming, and budgeting documents within the PPBE process. 4.  Documentation.  4.1.  Force and Financial Plan (F&FP). The USAF F&FP system fuses with the ABIDES databaseinteractive tool to develop and submit the Air Force FYDP to OSD.  It contains information onresources such as military and civilian manpower, flying hours, aircraft authorizations, and inventoryand procurement quantities, as well as dollars.  The F&FP provides considerable expansion of detailsover the FYDP for Air Force programs.  Modifications to the Air Force Program after submission toOSD require prior approval from OSD, and are implemented only with specific direction from HQUSAF.  Requests to modify the Air Force Program should refer to the F&FP and its resources data. 4.2.  Program. The Air Force disseminates the Program through program documents.  The principalprogram documents and the supplementary program documents list particular resource commoditiesof the overall programs and their OPRs (see Attachment 2).  Responsible HQ USAF organizationspublish the principal program documents after the PB submission.  They may also publish these doc-uments after a significant amended budget submission or any time OSD directs an additional update.These program documents are categorized by PE (where appropriate), consistent with the USAFF&FP, and are implemented only with specific and separate authority from HQ USAF. 4.3.  Program Change Requests (PCRs). PCRs are used to request an operational or fiscal changeoutside the normal PPBE cycle that is mission critical to accomplish in the execution or budget years.Changes to the Air Force Program after execution and budget years will be part of Program Agencyinitiatives or disconnects during the next POM programming phase.  General guidelines for Air ForcePCRs are outlined in Attachment 3. 4.3.1.  PCRs are submitted as fully funded or as no cost.  Reprogramming is necessary if a PCRdirects the transfer of funds between appropriations rather than absorbing the cost within anappropriation.  If the cost of the PCR is absorbed within the appropriation, reprogramming is stillrequired when moving funds between program elements. Examples are transferring Air ForceO&M to Air National Guard O&M, or using procurement funds to pay an O&M bill.  When thisoccurs in the current year, HQ USAF, OSD, and congressional approvals are required to supportthe reprogramming (use of funds in other than original appropriation submitted to and enacted byCongress).  The effective implementation date of PCR actions will be delayed until approved byOSD and Congress.  Failure to do so may result in an Anti-Deficiency Act Violation (DoD7000.14R, Vol. 14, Administrative Control of Appropriations and Anti-Deficiency Act Violations).When a PCR realigns funds between appropriations for the budget years, prior approval from HQUSAF and OSD is required. 12AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 20064.3.2.  Requests for reprogramming/realignment to fund a PCR are not automatically approved.Reprogramming within or between appropriations, within or over dollar thresholds, or involvingCongressional special interest line items all require special oversight.  HQ USAF, OSD, or Con-gress can deny the reprogramming/realignment actions.  MAJCOMs must weigh the risk associ-ated with identifying sources to offset a program change with the benefit of implementing the PCRoutside of the programming or budgeting cycle.  There is less risk when the PCR is sourced withinthe same appropriation. 4.4.  DoD and USAF Program Document Processing and Distribution:  4.4.1.  Program Elements are primary data elements in the FYDP.  They are organized into 11Major Force Programs (MFP)--6 combat force oriented programs, and 5 support programs.  TheAFCS assigns PEs to IPTs and Panels according to their force structure or support function.  Sincesome PEs may affect more than one Panel, cross-Panel coordination is an absolute requirement.The functional DCS, or the Secretariat equivalent functional manager, will coordinate assignmentchanges to existing PEs for approval by SECAF.  PE directives are located at Attachment 7. 4.4.2.  PPBE documents and supporting databases are not disclosed outside DoD or other govern-mental agencies (e.g., OMB) not directly involved in the defense planning and resource allocationprocess.  The OSD office responsible for the PPBE phase to which the document or database per-tains will consider requests for exceptions on a case-by-case basis.  The responsible offices are asfollows:  Under Secretary of Defense (Policy) for the Planning phase, the Under Secretary ofDefense, (Program Analysis and Evaluation) for the Programming phase, and the Under Secretaryof Defense (Comptroller) for the Budgeting phase [see DoD Instruction 7045.7].  The responsibleOSD office coordinates and approves requests with the General Counsel. 4.4.3.  The Air Force, by request, distributes SECAF and CSAF approved PPBE documents anddecisions to OSD and headquarters elements of the Departments of the Army and the Navy.Sub-elements of those departments that require information on Air Force programs should get itfrom their respective departmental headquarters.  The Air Force distributes program documentsinternally on a strict "need-to-know" basis (see DoD 5200.1-R, Information Security ProgramRegulation, January 1997, and AFPD 31-4, Information Security, 1 September 1998). 4.4.4.  HQ USAF distributes program documents to directorates through Programming Agencies.With specific, fully justified requests from the Programming Agencies, HQ USAF may distributedocuments directly to the subordinate commands immediately below MAJCOM level. 4.4.4.1.  HQ USAF/A8 controls the distribution for the principal program documents; theOPRs control supplementary documents (see Attachment 2). 4.4.4.2.  Send all requests for program documents through the Programming Agencies to theHQ USAF OPR. Do not use normal publications channels.  Requests for new or increased dis-tribution must: 4.4.4.2.1.  Be signed at the command’s directorate level. 4.4.4.2.2.  Identify the using agency. 4.4.4.2.3.  Justify the reason for the request. 4.4.4.2.4.  Identify the total number now being received in the command’s headquarters. AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006134.4.4.2.5.  Identify the Programming Agency’s focal point responsible for program docu-ment control. 4.4.4.2.6.  In determining total requirements, Programming Agencies should use focalpoints or classified libraries that can make copies available to several offices in order tominimize the number of copies needed. 4.4.4.2.7.  Using DoD 5200.1-R and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Manage-ment, Programming Agencies should reproduce parts of documents when an individualoffice or subordinate command does not need the whole document. 4.5.  Education and Training (E&T) Requirements Determination Process. A key programmingprocess is the E&T requirements determination process.  E&T issues cut across all MAJCOMs,FOAs, and DRUs, with results that drive extensive programming actions and must follow certaintimelines within the overarching PPBE process.  It is important to establish a framework that AirForce agencies can work with to determine, document and fund E&T requirements.  While thedetailed sub-process guidance resides in other associated AFIs, Attachment 9 to this AFI provides thenecessary overall framework for the E&T build.  Air Force organizations are required to adhere to thisframework and document those actions that drive programming actions. 4.6.  Limitations. Limit access to industrial firms under contract to the Air Force on a strict"need-to-know" basis as provided in DoD 5200.1-R/AFI 31-401 and DoD 5220.22-R, IndustrialSecurity Regulation, December 1985 and AFI 31-601, Industrial Security Program Management, 29June 2005.  Do not release entire documents.  The USD(C) will consider requests on a case-by-casebasis.

Itdoes not replace the functional staff but, rather, enhances it by allowing time critical or time limitedfunctional reviews at the appropriate levels.  The deliberative components of the Corporate Structure arethe Air Force Council (AFC), the Air Force Board (AFB), the Air Force Group (AFG), and the thirteenMission and Mission Support Panels.  This structure increases management effectiveness and improvescross-functional decision-making by providing a forum in which senior Air Force leadership can applytheir collective judgment, experience, and analysis to major programs, objectives, and issues.  Thisprocess balances programs among mission areas, between force structure and support, and betweenreadiness, modernization, and transformation.  Additionally, this approach ensures the Air Force programis capabilities based and supports the Joint warfighter.  Only military or Department of Defense civilianpersonnel assigned to the Air Staff or Office of the Secretary of the Air Force may serve as members ofthe corporate structure. AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 200617AFC (Air Force Council)—Advises and makes recommendations to the Chief of Staff and Secretary onmajor matters, including the responsiveness of Air Force plans and programs to national, Office of theSecretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Air Force objectives.  The Vice Chief of Staff chairs theAFC.  Membership is at the Deputy Chief of Staff (three-star) level, corresponding Secretariat level, andselected Directorate (two-star) level (para 3.2.).  AFB (Air Force Board)—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air Force Council (AFC) onmajor programming and other staffing issues.  In addition, the AFB conducts corporate reviews of theresource allocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and refineproposals prior to presentation to the AFC.  The AFB has decision authority for issues submitted by theAir Force Group (AFG). The Director of Programs chairs the AFB, except for purposes of budgetformulation and execution to include the Program Budget Review (PBR), Budget Review Cycle, andPresident’s Budget (PB), when the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Budget) (SAF/FMB) chairs it.Membership is at the General officer/Senior Executive Service level (para 3.3.) but advisory membersinclude the panel chairs, CONOPS Champions, and those with special expertise. AFG (Air Force Group)—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air Force Board (AFB) onmajor programming and other staffing issues.  Conducts corporate reviews of the resource allocationprocess, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and refine proposals prior topresentation to the AFB and the Air Force Council (AFC).  The Deputy Director of Programs chairs theAFG. Membership is at the Colonel/civilian equivalent level (para 3.4.), but advisory members include thepanel chairs, CONOPS champions, and those with special expertise.  The AFG is the first level in thecorporate structure that integrates the Air Force mission, mission support areas, and capabilities into abalanced Air Force program. Air Force Concept of Operation (AF CONOPS)—An Air Force Concept of Operations delineates thehighest service-level concept comprising a commander’s assumptions and intent to achieve desiredeffects through the guided integration of capabilities and tasks that solve a problem in an expectedmission area.   AF CONOPS Champion—The Air Staff focal point for service-level CONOPS and the capabilitiesdescribed and required by that AF CONOPS.  The Champion promotes the attainment and sustainment ofessential Air Force capabilities required to achieve the effects needed by Joint Force Commanders (JFC)to fulfill their assigned missions.  The Champion is also responsible for leading the Capabilities Reviewand Risk Assessment (CRRA) process, advocating AF CONOPS, effects, and capabilities in allDepartment of Defense, Joint Staff, and Air Staff capabilities-based planning processes, and informingthe Air Force Corporate and the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution System processes.   Air Force Mission/Mission Support Panel—Advises and provides recommendations to the Air ForceGroup (AFG) on major programming and other issues.  Conducts corporate reviews of the resourceallocation process, enhances the corporate decision process, and works to shape and refine proposals priorto the AFG.  Serves as initial point of entry for all issues requiring corporate review.  Panels work closelywith CONOPS Champions to ensure program capabilities are consistent with Integrated CapabilitiesReview and Risk Assessments (CRRA).  Chairs are designated by appropriate Deputy Chief of Staff/Assistant Secretary (para 3.4.2.). Budget Year(s)—The year(s) following the current fiscal year, and for which the budget estimatesubmission (BES) is prepared.  For example, if the current fiscal year were FY 2005, the budget year(s)would be FY 2006-07. 18AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006Capabilities Review and Risk Assessment—The Air Force process for identifying and assessing thelevels of capability needed to execute service-level concepts of operations, determining the status of thesecapabilities to achieve desired effects, and recommending courses of action to rectify overages, shortfalls,and gaps in the capability portfolio.   Disconnect—An approved program, which is unexecutable because of resource shortfalls.  Specific AirForce or Office of the Secretary of Defense Program Budget Decisions (PBDs) that change the programcontent or pace in the Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution cycle are not candidates fordisconnects in the following year’s cycle. D-22—Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, Financial Management and Comptroller,Directorate of Budget Operations (SAF/FMBO) Financial Plan exhibit used as a vehicle to transfer AirForce Operations and Maintenance funds between commands to include approved Program ChangeRequest actions for the budget year but not included in the President’s Budget submission. EIAP (Environmental Impact Analysis Process)—The Air Force program that implements therequirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), and the requirements foranalysis of environmental effects abroad under Executive Order 12114.  Specific procedures are in AFI32-7061, The Environmental Impact Analysis Process, 12 March 2003. Execution Year—The current fiscal year. Fiscal Year (FY)—The 12-month period which begins 1 October of one year and ends 30 September ofthe next year. FYDP—Future Years Defense Program.  The official OSD document and database that summarizesSecretary of Defense approved plans and programs for the Department of Defense. Initiative—A proposal for resources to initiate a new program (new start). Offsets—Resources that are offered to "pay" for a Program Change Request action, disconnect, orinitiative. Out Years—The years of the Air Force Program not included in the execution or budget years. Program Change Request (PCR)—Document used to request an out-of-cycle change to the FYDPprogram structure (during the execution and budget years).  Can be initiated by Headquarters USAF, theMAJCOMs, or other programming agencies.  Changes to the Air Force Program that begin beyond theexecution and budget years should be part of Program Agency initiatives or disconnects during the nextprogramming phase. Prior Year (PY)—The fiscal year immediately preceding the current year (last completed fiscal year).Also referred to as Past Year. USAF F&FP (USAF Force and Financial Plan)—The database that describes the Future YearsDefense Plan.  The Air Force portion of the DoD FYDP, consisting of a series of classified volumes,which shows (by program element code), a projection of the forces, manpower, and dollar resourcesapproved for the Air Force.  Interaction with the F&FP is accomplished using the Automated BudgetInteractive Data Environment System (ABIDES) program.  Changes to the F&FP using ABIDES, areaccomplished through the Resource Allocation Programming Information Decision System (RAPIDS).  AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 200619PROGRAM DOCUMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY PROGRAM DOCUMENTS LISTING Attachment 2    TitlePROGRAM DOCUMENTS ShortTitleHQ USAF OPR Aerospace Vehicles and Flying Hours (Annual)     •Vol I, Aircraft and Flying Hours by Mission Design Series      •Vol II, Aircraft and Flying Hours by Command      •Vol III, Strategic Missiles, Cruise Missiles and Remotely Piloted Vehicles     •Vol IV, Space Systems Installations, Units, and Programs (Annual)     •Section III, Priorities (Annual) PDPA A8PE A8PE A8PE A8PS A7CPB A8PE SUPPLEMENTARY PROGRAM DOCUMENTS TitleFlying Training ProgramManpower and Organization     •Vol I, Regular Forces      •Vol II, Reserve Forces Operational Test and Evaluation ProgramTactical Air Missile ProgramTechnical Training ProgramShort TitleHQ USAF OPR FTPPMPOPTPTTA3O A1M TE A5RW A1MP 20AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006Attachment 3  PROGRAM CHANGE REQUEST GUIDANCE   A3.1.  General Guidelines for Air Force PCRs.  A3.1.1.  Final approval authority is SECAF.   A3.1.2.  Use PCR actions to make off cycle corrections to programs.  Each PCR must be a stand-aloneaction that zero-balances in all years of the FYDP, so the PCR does not drive a bill to the Air Force. A3.1.3.  Gaining and losing MAJCOMs must agree to exact dollar amount of request before submit-ting it to HQ USAF.  PCRs will not be accepted without appropriate offsets identified for the budgetand execution years as well as throughout the FYDP.  All costs, to include tails, must be considered.Coordination between MAJCOM/FMs and MAJCOM/A8s is expected and should be documented forreference.   A3.1.4.  Identify adjustments to total Air Force Officer and Enlisted end strength by fiscal year anddisplay funding by fiscal year.  Transfers of end strengths between agencies and commands do notresult in a change to the Air Force Military Personnel Appropriation unless positions are being addedto or deleted from the Air Force manpower file.   A3.1.5.  After coordinating within Programming Agencies, submit PCRs to HQ USAF/A8P withinformational copies to SAF/FMB, other Programming Agencies, and HQ USAF Mission/MissionSupport Panels, as required.  Submit PCRs by message (Attachment 4) or as an e-mail attachment(Attachment 5 and Attachment 6).  Organizations with Defense Messaging System (DMS) capabil-ity should submit the PCR as a text file (Attachment 6) attached to a DMS message prepared accord-ing to standards.   A3.1.6.  Coordinate all end strength adjustments with HQ USAF/A1M.  SAF/FMBOP will providebudgetary figures for manpower requirements. A3.1.7.  Include in each PCR a detailed explanation of the costs involved for all appropriations/fundsources and Foreign Military Sales (FMS)/Security Assistance impacts.  For Procurement Accounts,in addition to the PE, include the Budget Program (BP).  Include out year costs and BP for PCRactions affecting out years.  Coordinate PCR cost estimates and savings with appropriate MAJCOMor equivalent Financial Management and Comptroller staff prior to submission to USAF/A8P. A3.1.8.  Identify in each PCR the source of cost estimates in each appropriation fund source.  Specifyoffsets within each appropriation/fund source for the execution and budget year and throughout theFYDP.  Offsets generated by FMS or Security Assistance programs must also be identified.  Each off-set will contain funding information to the program element and cost element detail.  For ProcurementAccounts, in addition to the PE, include the BP.  Each PCR will be a stand-alone action.  HQ USAFwill reject using offsets from prior or subsequent PCRs. HQ USAF will return PCRs without actionthat do not contain sufficient offsets. A3.1.9.  To identify PCRs, include the initiating organization name (Air Combat Command, NationalGuard Bureau, etc.), current fiscal year, and a sequential two-digit number (e.g., AMC 08-01 is thefirst PCR AMC submits in Fiscal Year 08).  AF/A8PE, as the Office of Primary Responsibility, willassign PCR numbers for HQ USAF generated PCRs.  The prefix will be HAF, followed by the currentfiscal year and sequence number (e.g., HAF 08-01). AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 200621A3.1.10.  Coordinate all PCRs with Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC/A4) and identify potentialsupport problems prior to sending them to HQ USAF.  AFMC provides impacts then HQ USAF opti-mizes the bed down plan. A3.1.11.  Each PCR will state that the requester has initiated an Environmental Impact Analysis Pro-cess (EIAP), as directed by AFI 32-7061, Environmental Impact Analysis Process, and as promul-gated in AFPD 32-70, will identify which Program Agencies have coordinated on the PCR. A3.2.  PCR Request Message.  A3.2.1.  Programming agencies will submit PCRs as a message or as a text file attached to a DMS ore-mail message.  See Attachment 4 for a sample request message.  See Attachment 5 for a samplee-mail or DMS attachment request. See Attachment 6 for sample e-mail.  As a minimum, the mes-sage will contain the following elements: A3.2.2.  Address to HQ USAF/A8P/A8PE.  Send information copies to all interested MAJCOMs, theother PCR Programming Agencies, SAF/FMBP, HQ USAF Directorates, the National Guard Bureau,and the Air Force Reserve.  HQ AFMC/A4 must be an addressee on all messages that affect forcestructure and flying hours. A3.2.3.  The Programming Agency PCR number and title. A3.2.4.  Brief summary of proposed changes and why it is mission critical to accomplish them in thebudget/execution years versus waiting for the next POM. A3.2.5.  Coordination obtained with other MAJCOMs, Combatant Commanders, etc. A3.2.6.  Force structure, manpower, and flying hour displays of current program and of proposedchanges by quarter of each fiscal year to include out years. When manpower slots are added, deleted,or transferred, display cost impact by fiscal year.  Coordinate any manpower cost data with SAF/FMBOP and note that such data are only approximately correct. A3.2.7.  The cost summary of proposed program should not include program element, appropriation/fund, cost element detail, and BP (for Procurement Accounts) including out years.  As a minimum,identify Flying Hour, Base Operating Support (BOS), Operations and Maintenance (O&M), SupportEquipment, Environmental Compliance, Real Property Maintenance (RPM), Military Family Hous-ing (MFH), Communications, Military Construction (MILCON), and Permanent Change of Station(PCS) costs.  If no impact, so state. A3.2.8.  Summary of proposed offsets to include program element, appropriation and cost elementdetail including out years.  Identify cost savings, over and above proposed offsets, resulting from pro-posed program.  Identify offsets generated by Foreign Military Sales/Security Assistance Programs. A3.2.9.  Discussion of the proposed plan, including the pros and cons of such areas as operationaleffects, combat enhancements, supportability issues, manpower issues, and Congressional concerns. A3.2.10.  Statement that EIAP actions have been initiated and a properly completed AF Form 813,Request for Environmental Impact Analysis, is being forwarded under separate cover. A3.2.11.  Identify any requirement for public announcement, host nation notification, and/or Congres-sional actions. A3.2.12.

It was released by HQ ACC/A8, Gen Smith. Note: This is an example of an e-mail to which a PCR would be attached. Follow these guidelines when using this method to submit a PCR: 1. Send the e-mail to exactly the same commands/offices that are on the addressee list on the message itself (see next page). If the office has a Workflow or SCATS inbox, use that. If not, send it to the office’s Executive Officer. The sender must determine which is appropriate for each addressee, and must determine and verify the e-mail address for each addressee. All HAF Work-flow and SCATS inboxes used in this example are correct as of this writing. Other addresses shown are representative and only for example purposes. Individual names are imaginary.  2. Do not put the PCR in the body of the e-mail itself, since text formatting is often lost when doing so. Make the PCR an attach-ment instead (see Attachment 5). 3. Make the attachment a stand-alone PCR, to include all addressee information. 4. Do not submit an official PCR unless it has been released by the appropriate authority.  5. When e-mailing a "working draft" PCR to the HAF AO for coord, mark the PCR "DRAFT". 6. Note Classification – SEE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE, para 13. AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 200633Attachment 7  PROGRAM ELEMENTS A7.1.  Creating or Changing Program Elements.  A7.1.1.  To create or change PEs, send requests to appropriate Air Staff Panel.  The Air Staff Panelsubmits the request into the current/processing database and coordinates with HQ USAF/A8PE.  HQUSAF/A8PE coordinates with the Secretariat, and then submits the request to the Office of the UnderSecretary of Defense (Comptroller) and the Director, Program Analysis and Evaluation, for approval.The Air Staff Panel will submit the Air Force Program (AFP) request via the current PE database.  HQUSAF/A8PE will confirm AFP request with Panel Chair.  Once the request is approved, HQ USAF/A8PE will notify Panel and ensure the AFP is added to appropriate databases.  When submitting arequest, be sure to include the following information:   A7.1.2.  State whether the request is to create a new PE, or to change an existing PE. A7.1.3.  State the title of the PE. A7.1.4.  State justification for why this PE is needed, or why it should be modified.  Include a recom-mendation for panel assignment. A7.1.5.  PE Description. A7.1.6.  The action officer’s name, office, and telephone number. A7.1.7.  State the AFP code. If the AFP does not exist submit an AFP Request Form (Attachment 8)along with PE request to the Air Staff Panel.   A7.2.  Air Force Programs (AFP).  A7.2.1.  AFP is a time phased set of resources that supports the activities that operate, modify, sustainor acquire weapon or support systems, or relate to the functions that supports the infrastructure neededto operate, maintain and acquire forces, and acquire and train personnel.  The resources include dol-lars, forces and manpower. NOTE: AFPs are only for internal AF deliberative processes. A7.2.2.  An AFP consists of a six-digit program code, title, and description in the F&FP system of theABIDES database tables and in the AF FSMS.  The main purpose of the code is to provide program-matic insight into the F&FP database.  In addition, the coding structure facilitates rapid viewing ofgroupings that cut across programs, program elements, and Panels.  Examples of these cross-cuttersare Depot Purchase Equipment Maintenance (DPEM), Aerospace Vehicle Petroleum (AVPOL), Mil-itary and Civilian Pay, and Military Construction.  No program code will be created without identify-ing dollars to support it. A7.2.3.  Administration of AFP:  HQ USAF/A8PE shall review all AFP additions, deletions, andchanges.  A7.2.4.  Process for Creating or Changing AFPs: A7.2.4.1.  The Panel must receive authorization from Panel Chair before submitting AFP codewithin current database for approval.   34AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006A7.2.4.2.  The request should state the definition and justification for the AFP. A7.2.4.3.  State the current program you are moving dollars from only when applicable. A7.2.4.4.  State the PE and Appropriation (Appn) associated with the proposed program. A7.2.4.5.  Coordinate with Appn Mgr(s), Program Element Monitor(s) and MAJCOM(s). A7.2.4.6.  Panel must submit a Zero Balance Transfer (ZBT) with a temporary AFP code, whenappropriate. A7.2.4.7.  The Panel will propose an AFP Group and AFP Roll-up code when required. A7.2.5.  AF/A8PE will confirm AFP request with Panel Chair.  Once the request is approved, AF/A8PE will notify Panel and ensure the AFP is added to appropriate databases. AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 200635Attachment 8  AIR FORCE PROGRAM (AFP) REQUEST TO AIR STAFF PANEL Date of Request:15-Feb-05 AF Panel Name:   Communications and Information AFP Name:   Information Assurance Support AFP Group:   INFOSEC AFP Rollup:   Counter Info PE Number:   33140F APPNS:   Forces:   Manpower:   Dollars:   01 (PAA)   05 (Active)   10 X   28   51   56   35   02 (Buy Quantity)   06 (Guard)   14 X   30   52   60   37   03 (Flying Hours)   07 (Reserve) X   16   32   54   61   39          04 (PAI)   24   50   55   A1   AFP Definition: Identifies funding targeted for Air Force IA and Info Protect efforts.

Training commands produce reports to detail reduced, additive, and/or balanced resource requirements (force structure, flying hours, facilities, and student load) to meet PRDs/PGLs, and submit to AF/A3OT and AF/A1PT.   weiveRgnicirPdna  stnemeriuqeRAF/A3O, AF/A1P  Brief PRDs/PGLs shortfalls and changes to AFCS AF/A3O, AF/A1P AETC Issue revised planning PRDs / PGLs for Flying Training, Technical Training, and Education to training commands AETC corporately reviews requirements AF/A3O, AF/A1P, AETC/A8P Brief requirements and resources to MAJCOMs MAJCOMs Vote on E&T resourcing 8-Jul  AF/A3OT and AF/A1PT develop and present briefings to the AFCS providing detail of reduced, sustained, and additive requirements to E&T mission areas.  This informational briefing will highlight potential resource implications that may have impact to upcoming programming activities.  The AFCS provides scrutiny and clarification for presented requirements.  Redirection is provided as appropriate. 15-Jul  Based on guidance from the AFCS, revised constrained requirements are documented in planning PRDs / PGLs and delivered to training commands for final costing development. 15-Oct  AETC conducts MAJCOM-level Group, Board and Council to ultimately gain AETC/CC approval of E&T issues being submitted for Air Force program consideration.  (Note: Training commands, other than AETC, who provide products to external customers will follow like procedures for developing E&T issues to be considered in the AF programming exercise.) 1-Nov  MAJCOM programmers are called to a conference where AF/A3OT and AF/A1PT brief AFCS validated E&T requirements, and AETC briefs resource implications (along with other training commands, as necessary).  Supporting documentation is provided to MAJCOMs for their review / action. 16-Nov  Based on E&T requirements, MAJCOMs gain their commander's position on all presented issues.  MAJCOM positions are then presented during the Worldwide Planners and Programmers Conference, and a funding strategy is developed to be part of the programming withhold (proportionate to customer MAJCOMs).  Conflicting MAJCOM positions are discussed and resolved to the extent possible (AF/A8P works with MAJCOM A8s to develop final position). 38AFI16-501   15 AUGUST 2006PHASE  ORGANIZATION TASK AF/A8PE AF/A8P(D) AF/A8P AF/A8PE AF/A8P AETC Brief AFG on proposed withhold Brief AFB on proposed withhold Brief AFC on proposed withhold Insert withhold amounts in APPG Final APPG to the field Provide data to MAJCOMs for new E&T bills not covered in the APPG Withhold MAJCOMs Submit POM to AFCS AF/A3O, AF/A1P  Publish final PGLs and PRDs      perPMOPdnanoitazilaniFGPPA DUE DATE* 5-Dec  E&T funding strategy is presented as part of the PROCESS NOTES overall withhold.  The proposed withhold is presented to the AF Group for consideration / approval. 8-Dec  The AF Board reviews the proposed withhold and develops recommendation for the AF Council. 13-Dec  The AF Council reviews and approves the programming withhold. 16-Dec  E&T issues approved to be part of the AF withhold are presented in the Air Force Planning and Programming Guidance (APPG).  Formulas used to develop the withhold, and how it is apportioned to user MAJCOMs, is also documented. 30-Dec  MAJCOMs develop offsets to pay for E&T bills included in the APPG withhold. 15-Mar  AETC/A8 develops detail and costing package for E&T bills that are new to the programming exercise since the Worldwide Planners and Programmers Conference.  Package sent to all MAJCOM/A8s with potential cost breakout consistent with APPG withhold formulas. 30-Apr  AETC submits E&T disconnects, without associated offsets, to Air Staff.  AETC also submits any offsets resulting from reduced E&T requirements, if not already accounted for in requirements / withhold development.  All MAJCOMs submit their POM to Air Staff, which includes offsets for E&T bills (withhold).  New E&T issues submitted in the AETC POM are presented without offset to the AFCS along with announcement documentation (detailed in previous step).  In these cases, the AFCS determines the most appropriate course of action (such as approval, disapproval, deferral, approval pending customer MAJCOM(s) support, etc.). 30-Jun  Based on AFCS approval of E&T requirements, AF/A3OT and A1PT develop/publish final PGLs and PRDs, and release to training commands. *NOTE:  DUE DATE is for planning purposes.  AF/A8 will set and publish actual due dates, if they vary from the dates pub-lished in this Attachment.
