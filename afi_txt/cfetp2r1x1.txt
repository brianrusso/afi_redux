This  Career  Field  Education  and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  for  AFSC  2R1X1,  Maintenance Management  Production  Specialty  is  a  comprehensive  education  and  training  document  that identifies  life-cycle  education/training  requirements,  training  support  resources,  and  minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE:    Civilians  occupying  associated  positions  will  use  Part  II  to  support  duty  position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; supervisors will use both parts of the CFETP to plan, manage, and control training.  2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan.  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path.  Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other).  Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities.  2.2.    Part  II  includes  the  following:    Section  A  contains  the  course  objective  list  and  training standards  supervisors  use  to  determine  if  Airmen  have  satisfied  Air  Education  and  Training Command (AETC) training requirements.  Section B identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTP) developed to support proficiency training.  Section C identifies a training course index supervisors use to determine resources available to support training; included here are both mandatory and optional courses.  Section D identifies Major  Command  (MAJCOM)  unique  training  requirements  supervisors  use  to  determine additional  training  requirements  unique  to  the  MAJCOM.    Section  E  identifies  the  Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, and technical references to support training; AETC conducted training; wartime course requirements; core tasks; and correspondence course requirements.  3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today’s work force for tomorrow’s jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.    1  ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training (AT):  Formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.

Purpose.  This  CFETP  provides  information  necessary  for  AFCFM,  MAJCOM  Functional Managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in  AFSC 2R1X1 should receive to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon  retraining  into  this  specialty  for  award  of  the  3-skill  level.    Normally,  this  training  is conducted  by  AETC  at  one  of  the  technical  training  centers.    Upgrade  training  identifies  the mandatory  courses,  task  qualification  requirements,  and  correspondence  course  completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance  training  designed  to  qualify  an  Airman  in  a  specific  duty  position.  This  training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance  skills/knowledge  required  to  do  the  job.    Advanced  training  is  formal  specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job (OJT), provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some are:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.    Also,  it  is  used  to  help  supervisors  identify  training  at  the  appropriate  point  in  an individual's career.  1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career.  1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints, which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP. The CFETP will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.    AETC  training  personnel  will  develop/revise  formal  resident,  non-resident,  field  and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training.   2.2. MFMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency  requirements.    Identified  requirements  can  be  satisfied  by  OJT,  resident  training, contract training, or  exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFS is identified for inclusion into this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.  4  engines,  missiles, space and  maintains aerospace  vehicle, 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The lists of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.    Coordination  and  Approval.    The  AFCFM  is  the  approval  authority.    MAJCOM representatives  and  AETC  training  personnel  will  identify  and  coordinate  on  the  career  field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.    Section B - Career Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.  4.1.  Specialty Summary.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play  an  important  role  in  the  Air  Force's  ability  to  accomplish  its  mission.    It  is  essential  for everyone involved in training to do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives necessary training at appropriate points in their career.  5.2.    Apprentice  (3)  Level.    Following  Basic  Military  Training,  initial  skills  training  will  be provided in resident courses at the 82d Training Wing, Sheppard AFB TX.  The courses will lay the foundation for additional training at the graduate’s first duty assignment.  Trainees will utilize the CDC and task qualification training to progress in their career field.  Upon completion of CDC 2R151, Air Force core task qualifications, and commander’s recommendation the trainee will be awarded their 5 skill level.  5.3.    Journeyman  (5)  Level.    Once  upgraded  to  the  5-level,  the  journeyman  will  enter  into continuation training that will broaden their experience base by increasing their knowledge and skill in troubleshooting and solving more complex problems.  After having 48 months in the Air Force or upon selection to Staff Sergeant, 5-levels will attend Airman Leadership School (ALS) to  enhance  their  Professional  Military  Education  (PME).    After  attending  the  formal  trainer’s course, 5-levels can be considered for appointment as unit trainers.  Trainers must be qualified and certified in the appropriate task, before he/she can conduct training in those tasks.  CDC study is continued  to  prepare  for  Weighted  Airman  Promotion  testing.    Airmen  should  also  consider continuing their formal education by pursuing a Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) degree.  5.4.  Craftsman (7) Level.  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions.    Once  upgraded,  7-levels  should  take  courses  to  obtain  added  knowledge  on management of resources and personnel.  They should also become thoroughly familiar with all facets  of  Maintenance  Operations  (MO)  activities.    Once  promoted  to  Technical  Sergeant  see AFI36-2301. (See table A8.2.)    6  5.5. Superintendent (9) Level.  A 9-level can be expected to fill the position of Maintenance Operations Superintendent or MAJCOM functional manager.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.    Individuals  promoted  to  SMSgt  will  attend  the  Senior  Noncommissioned  Officer Academy IAW AFI36-2301.  They should be knowledgeable and possess the ability to apply the AF Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures as outlined in AFTTP 3-3.  Additional higher education and completion of courses outside their career AFSC are also recommended.  6.    Training  Decisions.    The  CFETP  uses  a  building  block  approach  (simple  to  complex)  to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the 2R1X1 Maintenance Management Production career field.   The spectrum includes  a strategy  for when, where, and how to meet training  requirements.    The  strategy  must  ensure  we  develop  affordable  training,  eliminating duplication and preventing a fragmented approach to training.  The following training decisions were made at the Career Field U&TW at Sheppard AFB from 11 January 2016 to 15 January 2016.  6.1.  Initial  Skills.  The  3-level  resident  course  provides  training  in  Maintenance  Management Production.  The U&TW working group members revised the 3-level course. The review included an increased emphasis on maintenance organization and added additional focus areas for TCTO and time change management core areas.    6.2. 5-Level Upgrade Requirements. To upgrade to the 5-level, personnel must meet educational, training, and grade requirements as listed in table A8.1. Enlisted Career Path.  The U&TW made a number of upgrade training changes.  They added subject knowledge objectives for training management.  5-level core tasks were increased significantly.  6.3.  7-Level Upgrade Requirements.  7-skill level upgrade training in this specialty consists of completing all 3- and 5-skill level training requirements.  Upgrade training begins the first day of the promotion cycle upon selection to staff sergeant and requires completion of all training as indicated by task and knowledge training requirements identified in STS 2R1X1, which is included in Part II, Section A, of this plan.  The trainee is also required to complete the 7-skill level CDCs and Maintenance Management Production Craftsman course.  Areas covered are:  Logistics and Resource  Management,  Supply  Management,  Maintenance  Management,  and  Training Management.  Additionally, the trainee must meet all requirements prescribed in the applicable MAJCOM training directives.  During the U&TW, the group made minor changes to the 7-level upgrade training objectives.    6.4.    Continuation  Training.    Any  additional  knowledge  and  skill  requirements  not  taught through  initial  or  upgrade  training  are  assigned  to  unit  training  or  training  detachments.  The purpose  of  the  continuation  training  program  is  to  provide  additional  training  in  excess  of minimum  upgrade  training  requirements  with  emphasis  on  present  and  future  duty  positions.  MAJCOMs  develop  a  proficiency  training  program  that  ensures  individuals  in  the  2R1X1 Maintenance Management Production career field receive necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  The program identifies both mandatory and optional training requirements.  7.  Community College of the Air Force (CCAF).  CCAF offers and awards job-related associate in  applied  science  degrees  and  other  academic  credentials  that  enhance  mission  readiness, 7   contribute to recruiting, assist in retention and support the career transitions of Air Force enlisted members.  The college works with Air Force training centers, regional accrediting agencies, and hundreds of cooperating civilian colleges and universities. The technical nature of most Air Force courses, placed at the same level with college studies, can award Airmen full college credits for most of what they learn through formal coursework and on-the-job training. Enrollment in CCAF occurs upon completion of basic military training.  CCAF provides the opportunity to obtain an Associate in Applied Science Degree.  In addition to its associate degree program, CCAF offers the following:  7.1.    Occupational  Instructor  Certification.

Also included in this section are actions required, 15  office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  As a minimum, resource constraints will be reviewed and updated annually.  12.  No resource constraints identified. PART II  Section A - Course Objective List  1.  Measurement.  Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective consists of a condition, behavior, and standard.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc.).  The behavior is the observable portion  of  the  objective  (i.e.  perform  an  operational  check).    The  standard  is  the  level  of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  Each objective uses letter codes(s) to identify how it is measured.  All objectives use the PC code that indicates a progress check is used to measure subject or task knowledge.  “W” indicates a comprehensive written test and is used to measure the subject or task knowledge at the end of a block of instruction.  “PC/W” indicates a subject or task knowledge progress check and a separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test.  2.  Standard.  The standard for written examinations is 70%. Standards for performance objectives are indicated in the objective and are also indicated on the individual progress check checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress on each task.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test.   3.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective supports.  Review the proficiency code key in Part II, Section E of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest  parts  of  the  task  (partially  proficient).    The  student  can  also  determine  step  by  step procedures for doing the task.  4.  Course Objectives.  A detailed listing of initial skills or craftsman course objectives may be obtained by submitting a written request to 363 TRS/TRR, 520 Missle Road, Sheppard AFB TX 76311-2261 or contacting the OPR by telephone at DSN 736-8777.

This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning  with  course  J3ACR2R131  0S7B,  1  Jan  2017  and  J3ABR2R131  0S3B,  1  Jan  2017.  Course J3AZR2R1XX 0E1B has a separate Course Training Standard (CTS) and is not governed by this STS.    15.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:  15.1.    Lists  in  column  1  the  most  common  tasks,  knowledge,  and  Technical  References  (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  15.2.  Identifies in column 2 (Core Tasks) by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. Core tasks identified with an */R are not required for the AFRC and the ANG.  As a minimum,  all AFCFM-directed core tasks applicable to this specialty must be completed and signed off for skill level upgrade.  There is no longer an Air Force requirement for third-party certification of core tasks in this AFSC.  However, MAJCOMs, commanders, and work center supervisors still retain the option to designate critical tasks (core or non-core) as requiring third-party certification.  To designate a task as requiring third-party certification, circle the appropriate asterisk in the core task column on the specialty training standard (STS) portion of the CFETP in the master task list (MTL) and individual training records.  If the task is not already designated as a core task, place just  the  circle  at  the  appropriate  location  in  the  core  task  column.  Core  tasks,  which  are  not applicable  to  base  assigned  aircraft  or  equipment,  are  not  required  for  upgrade  (units  are  not required to send personnel TDY for core task training).  15.3.    Provides  certification  for  OJT.    Column  3  is  used  to  record  completion  of  tasks  and knowledge  training  requirements.    Use  automated  training  management  systems  to  document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification/completed date.  15.4.    Shows  formal  training  and  correspondence  course  requirements.    Column  4  shows  the proficiency  to  be  demonstrated  on  the  job  by  the  graduate  as  a  result  of  training  on  the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.    15.5.    Qualitative  Requirements.    Attachment  1  contains  the  proficiency  code  key  used  to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.  15.6. Job Qualification Standard.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  15.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training in accordance with AFI 36-2201.  TBA must be used when available. 19   15.6.1.1. Converting from Old Document to CFETP. All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are replaced  by  this  CFETP;  therefore,  conversion  of  all  training  records  to  this  CFETP  STS  is mandatory.  Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201.  15.7. STS. This STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion  System  (WAPS).  Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  (SKTs)  are  developed  at  the  USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron, by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study  references  listed  in  the  WAPS  catalog.    Individual  responsibilities  are  in  AFI  36-2502, Airman Promotion/Demotion Programs.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve.  16.  Recommendations.
