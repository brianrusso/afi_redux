This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training.  2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, Air Education and Training Command (AETC) conducted training, wartime course, core task, and correspondence course requirements; Section B is reserved in this CFETP; Section C identifies available support materials.  An example is a Qualification Training Package (QTPs which may be developed to support proficiency training). These packages are identified in the Air Force Master Catalog; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.    3.  Guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their careers.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.         1 ATTACHMENT 2, STS 2T031/2T051/2T071 ABBREVIATIONS/TERMS EXPLAINED  Advanced Training (AT) —Formal course that provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills and knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.

Purpose.  This CFETP provides information necessary for Air Force Career Field Managers (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective career field training program.  This plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  Normally, this training is conducted by AETC at one of the technical training centers.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or using exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several uses, some are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  It is also used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education/training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training delivery method. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFEPT.  MFMs and supervisors will use this  plan at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop/revise formal resident, non-resident, field and exportable training courses based on requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied using OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable training courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified for inclusion into plan. 2.3.  Each trainee will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference for additional training.  3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager for this specialty will initiate an annual review of this document by AETC and MFMs to ensure requirements are current and accurate.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. 5 ATTACHMENT 2, STS 2T031/2T051/2T071 Section B - Career Progression and Information  4.  Specialty Description.  4.1.

Implementation.   1.1. Specialty Training Standard 2T031/2T051 Traffic Management Apprentice/Traffic Management Journeyman will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning 051003 graduating 051220. 1.2. Specialty Training Standard 2T071 Traffic Management Craftsman will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning February 2006.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, volume 5,this STS: 2.1.  Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical References) spell out the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for airman to perform duties in the  3-, 5-, and 7-skill level of the Traffic Management ladder of the Transportation Career Field.  These tasks and knowledge items are based on an analysis of the duties and responsibilities contained in AFMAN 36-2108.  Wartime tasks are identified by an "*" in the far left of column 1.   2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) represent mandatory specialty-wide training requirements. Core Tasks are identified by an "*" in the proper skill level column(A-3, B-5 or C- 7).  Refer to AFI 36-2201 vol. 3 for more details on core tasks.  Completion of non-mandatory tasks, tasks not identified which are pertinent to the unit, will be accomplished as tasks become available for training. 2.3.  Column 3 (Certification for OJT) provides certification for OJT, it is used to record the status  of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use the Master Task List for the current unit to circle the appropriate items.  Tasks and knowledge items status documentation must show a start date, completion date, trainee/trainer and certifier initials (when required). Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.  Refer to AFI 36-2201 vol. 3 for more details on proper training documentation. 2.4.  Column 4 (Proficiency codes....) shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit training manager for current CDC listings.   2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.6. This STS becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record Folder, and used according to AFI 36-2201, Volume 3.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  2.6.1.  Documentation.  For documentation and transcribing procedures, see AFI 36-2201, volume 3. 2.6.1.1.  Documenting Career Knowledge.  When a CDC is not available:  the supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover the mandatory items in AFMAN 36-2108.  For two-time CDC course exam failures:  supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC.  The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier, and receives certification on the STS.  NOTE:  Career Knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver. 14 ATTACHMENT 2, STS 2T031/2T051/2T071 2.6.1.2.  Decertification and Recertification.  When an airman is found to be unqualified on a task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor lines through the previous certification or deletes previous certification when using automated system.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification.  The individual is recertified (if required) either by erasing the old entries and writing in the new or by using correction fluid (if the entries were made in ink) over the previously certified entry. 2.6.2.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. 2.7.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605,  Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air Force Reserves and Air National Guard.  3.  Recommendations.
