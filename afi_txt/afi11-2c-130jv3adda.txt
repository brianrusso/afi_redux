Sound  Judgment.  Instructions  in  this  AFI  are  mandatory  and  provide  the  best  possible operating instructions under most circumstances, but can not account for every possible situation that  a  crewmember  may  encounter  during  contingency  operations.    During  these  times  the loadmaster must use his/her sound judgment and operational  risk management to  meet  mission demands. 1.2.  General.  This  instruction  establishes  basic  cargo  compartment  configuration,  standard equipment,  and  equipment  locations  aboard  C-130J,  C-130J  (short  version),  and  WC-130J aircraft.  In order to meet HQ AF guidance toward conserving fuel, equipment will be removed when not needed to reduce the aircraft weight In Accordance With (IAW) Table 1.1, Table 2.1 and Table 2.2  Aircraft will not have tool boxes larger than the standard crew chief tool box, nor large  garbage  cans  onboard  the  aircraft.    Some  C-130J  aircraft  have  additional  equipment installed  that  may  affect  configuring  the  aircraft  as  listed.    For  operational  planning  purposes, each  configuration  has  an  average  time  annotated  and  number  of  personnel  to  configure  the airplane.  The times quoted are approximate figures and are configuration times only.  They do not  include  de-configuration  times.    For  example,  reconfiguring  from  a  P-1  configuration,  128 sidewall  and  center  aisle  seats  to  a  C-1  configuration  (clean  floor)  requires  more  than  one-half hour  for  one  person,  which  is  the  time  allocated  to  configure  a  C-1  configuration.    Units  with operational  control  over  the  WC-130J  will  determine  standard  configurations  except  when aircraft are gained to AMC. 1.3.  Responsibility.  Operational  plans  must  consider  the  most  appropriate  configuration  that satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to change.    USAF  units  performing  services  on  C-130J/C-130J(S)/WC-130J  aircraft  (i.e., maintenance,  aerial  port,  and  aircrew  flight  equipment)  are  responsible  for  configuring  the aircraft  IAW  this  instruction  and  as  outlined  in  mission  directives,  to  include  equipment stowage/installation  IAW  the  configuration  and  equipment  tables.    Aircrew  Flight  Equipment (AFE)  personnel  will  ensure  all  life  sustaining  equipment  is  positioned  on  the  aircraft  to  meet mission  requirements  IAW  Table  1.1.  Maintenance  personnel  will  ensure  all  required  and mission specific equipment is positioned aboard the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW Table  2.1  and  Table  2.2.    Some  equipment  listed  in  Table  2.2  is  roll  on/roll  off  equipment controlled by unit designated personnel.  Before home station departure, maintenance personnel are  responsible  for  configuring  the  aircraft  (including  modifications)  to  meet  mission requirements IAW Figure 3.1 thru Figure 3.64.  For the CP-2 through CP-5 configurations, the sidewall  seats  will  be  stowed  to  facilitate  preflight  of  the  Enhanced  Cargo  Handling  System (ECHS)  rails  and  then  lowered  by  aircrew  with  maintenance  assistance.    After  departure  from home  station, the  aircrew  will  accomplish  all  configurations  with  assistance  by maintenance/aerial  port  personnel  if  available.    During  preflight,  aircrew  will  ensure  required mission equipment has been provided and is properly installed.  When the aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the loadmaster will assist in the completion of the configuration,  after  accomplishing  required  pre-departure  duties  (i.e.,  preflight,  loading,  etc.).  Loadmasters have overall responsibility for configuration management and proper installation of equipment on the aircraft. 8 AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA  9 DECEMBER 2009 1.4.  Standard  Configuration  Codes.  Use  the  following  codes  when  referring  to  C-130J/C-130J (short)/WC-130J cargo compartment configurations. 1.4.1.  S – C-130J (short version) 1.4.2.  A* - Armor Equipped Aircraft 1.4.3.  AE - Aeromedical Evacuation 1.4.4.  C - Cargo 1.4.5.  CP - Cargo and Passengers 1.4.6.  P - Passengers 1.4.7.  TAP - Tactical Airdrop Paratroop 1.4.8.  TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo 1.4.9.  NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1.5.  Modifications.  Configuration  codes  of  this  instruction  may  require  modifications  for  a specific  mission.    Each  modification  must  be  carefully  evaluated  prior  to  mission  operation  to ensure maximum flight safety and aircraft equipment compatibility.  Each mission directive will identify  basic  configuration  codes  and  modifications  to  satisfy  mission  requirements.    For example,  an  aeromedical  evacuation  mission  may  require  more  litters  than  available  in configuration  AE-1.    Consult  appropriate  configuration  charts  to  determine  where  the  desired additional  litters  can  be  installed  and  which  seats  must  be  removed.    Indicate  in  the  mission directive,  by  position  (left  or  right,  and  number)  which  seats  are  deleted  and  (by  alphabetical position)  litter  tier  provisions  are  installed.    Example:  Configuration  AE-1(Mod),  remove  seats 12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D. computing 1.6.  Weight  and  Balance.  Configuration  equipment  and  necessary  supply  changes  affect aircraft weight  and balance.  To standardize equipment quantities and location, items  shown in Table  2.1  will  be  included  in  the  aircraft  basic  weight  and  remain  on  the  aircraft  except  for maintenance  and  inspection.    Equipment  listed  in  Table  1.1  and  Table  2.2  will  be  added  as necessary  when in Communications/Navigation/Identification-Management Unit (CNI-MU) and references 5, 6, or 7  of  DD  Form  365-4,  Weight  and  Balance  Clearance  Form  F-Transport/Tactical.    The loadmaster  will  enter  the  weight  contained  in  the  required  equipment  table  for  the  applicable configuration  in  the  CNI-MU  and  when  preparing  the  DD  Form  365-4.    Adjustments  will  be made  when  the  actual  on  board  weight  of  these  items  vary  from  the  data  shown.  Add  aircraft armor  (Table  4.2)  into  the  DD  Form  365-4  (Form  F)  if  armor  is  installed  on  the  aircraft. Paratroop door armor moments need to be re-calculated when armor is re-positioned.  DD Form 365-4 will be completed IAW instructions in Chapter 5 of this instruction. the  weight entered and balance and 1.7.  Revisions.  To  recommend  changes,  conflicts,  suggestions,  or  recommendations  to departmental publications, use the AF Form 847 and route it through the publishing channels to the OPR for the publication. 1.8.  Aircraft  Configuration  Waivers  and  Supplements.  Follow  waiver  protocol  in  AFI  11-2C-130J, Volume 3.  MAJCOMs forward approved requests to HQ AMC/A3V for continuity. AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA  9 DECEMBER 2009 9 1.9.  Aircrew Life Sustaining Equipment Configuration.  Mobility Air Forces C-130J aircraft are  configured  with  standard  quantities  of  aircrew  life  sustaining  equipment  (ALSE)  IAW  this instruction.    Configure  aircraft  as  listed  in  Table  1.1.    During  aircraft  contingency/deployment generations,  it  is  imperative  that  aircraft  deploy  with  the  full  complement  of  ALSE.    This equipment  must  be  at  forward  operating  locations  to  allow  maximum  mission  flexibility  when aircraft are away from home station.  In the event installed ALSE inspection dates expire while the  aircraft  is  on  alert  status  or  away  from  operating  location,  place  these  items  in  the  AFTO Form 781A on a red dash until the aircraft goes off alert or returns to operating location.  When aircraft is released from alert or returns to operating location, upgrade to a red X IAW TO 00-20-1 Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. 1.9.1.  Aircraft  Transfer  Requirements.    When  transferring  aircraft;  position  ALSE  IAW permanent  transfer  configuration.    Losing  unit  will  contact  the  gaining  organization’s  AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records.  The gaining  organization  will  conduct  an  acceptance  inspection  and  forward  a  copy  of discrepancies,  to  include  any  equipment  shortages,  to  their  respective  MAJCOM  IAW  TO 00-20-1.    Without  documented  coordination  and  approval,  do  not  transfer  aircraft  with  less than the required equipment.  The losing organization must make up any shortages from on-hand assets to ensure transferring aircraft has required equipment. 1.9.2.  ALSE Overhead Racks.  Handle ALSE with care to avoid damage to the equipment.  ALSE will always be placed in the overhead racks, unless stowed elsewhere for aircraft CG limitations.    The  primary  purpose  of  all  overhead  racks  is  for  ALSE.    Other  items  of equipment  placed  in  the  overhead  racks  must  not  interfere  with  ALSE  life  sustaining equipment and be easily secured.  Oil, hydraulic fluid or other liquids will not be placed on the rack. 1.9.3.  Aircraft  Returning  From  Off  station.    To  minimize  AFE  reconfiguration  time  upon return from off station operations, crewmembers  must return parachutes,  kits, and AFE life sustaining equipment to their primary position after each mission.  AFE personnel will ensure the aircraft is returned to the local training configuration at earliest opportunity not to exceed 5 workdays.  The five work day rule does not apply if the aircraft will not be flown during that  period.  In  this  case  the  aircraft  will  be  in  the  proper  configuration  prior  to  next  flight.  All added equipment will be removed; under no circumstances will an aircraft be flown in a partial configuration.  NOTE:  Items listed in  the table below  are  for stretch aircraft.

General.  This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan format and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment. 3.2.  Configuration.  Although basic configuration modifications are authorized to meet special requirements, the following factors shall be considered: 3.2.1.  Single  sidewall  seats  shall  not  be  used  unless  connected  to  a  double  sidewall  seat (except for specific configurations). 3.2.2.  Passengers/ambulatory  patients  may  not  be  seated  closer  than  30  inches  in  front  of palletized, netted cargo or cargo secure with straps.  This does not apply to cargo restrained by chains/chain  bridle assemblies.  When palletized or non-palletized cargo is  secured with aircraft  tie  down  chains,  the  30-inch  spacing  is  not  required.    EXCEPTION:    Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters. 3.2.2.1.  Parachutes will be carried IAW Table 1.1.  When passengers/troops are carried with parachutes on board, up to four seats will not be available in the cargo compartment. 3.2.3.  Normal  spacing  for  paratroopers  is  24  inches;  however,  spacing  will  be  as  mission dictates.  Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch spacing. 3.2.4.  Cargo  height  in  pallet  position  two  may  be  restricted  if  overhead  equipment  rack(s) protrude into the cargo area.  This restriction will be 76 inches and will begin at the inboard side of the cargo handling system rails and extend inboard 12 inches.  This restriction could be on either or both sides of the aircraft. 3.2.5.  For  flight,  the  aircraft  ramp’s  cargo  weight  limit  is  5,000  pounds  of  floor  loaded  or palletized  cargo  in  pallet  position  eight  (six  for  short),  (to  include  the  weight  of  pallet  and nets).  See TO 1C-130J-9 for other restrictions. 3.2.6.  Changes in configuration may affect overall aircraft center of gravity (CG).  NOTE:  The  addition  of  aircraft  defensive  systems,  Kevlar,  and  other  modifications  produces  a forward CG which must be countered by adjusting the load center of balance within TO 1C-130J-1 limits.  Weight for this equipment is in Table 4.2 and Table 4.3. 3.2.7.  This chapter’s drawings are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations.  Clear space depicted forward of the first center aisle seat and aft of the last center aisle  seat  on  STAP-1/TAP-1  configuration  is  unusable.   NOTE:  Center  aisle  seats  begin  at the first seat stanchion point LS 357 (262) 3.2.8.  A  20-inch  clear  area  is  required  on  the  forward  right  side  of  a  ramp  pallet  to  allow access to aft latrine facilities.  A safety aisle is required in pallet positions four, five and eight or for C-130J(S) three, four, and six.  (Para 4.2.3, Figure 4.1). 3.2.9.  Trashcans, other than integral containers, will not be carried. 3.2.10.  Seats 1 and 2, left side will be stowed to allow unrestricted flight deck/crew entrance door access when the seats are not needed to accomplish a specific mission. 18 AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA  9 DECEMBER 2009 3.2.11.

Aeromedical  evacuation  (AE)  configurations.    Medical  Crew  Directors  (MCD)  and Charge  Medical  Technician  (CMT)  will  determine  final  litter  equipment  configuration  and aeromedical  evacuation  crewmember  (AECM)  seating.    AECM  seat  locations  may  vary based on patient/cabin observation requirements.  Overhead equipment racks, missile defense system modifications, and secure voice communications system will decrease litter capacity to  six  seats  are  required  for in AECM’s/loadmaster(s)  depending  on  crew  complement.   Seats  are  numbered  for identification  from  front  to  rear  and  will  be  referred  to  as  seat  1-left,  or  seat  1-right,  etc.  Litter tiers  are identified alphabetically  and litter spaces identified numerically  from  lowest (1)  to  highest  (5).    On  litter  tier  configuration  illustrations,  the  number  in  parentheses indicates  total  litters  per  tier.    Roller  conveyers  will  be  stowed  where  litters  and  seats  are rigged.  AE equipment, which may be secured in unused seats if floor space is limited, may reduce  seat  availability.    Portable  therapeutic  liquid  oxygen  (PTLOX)  shall  be  stowed  in  a location  to  prevent  contact  with  fuels  or  hydraulic  fluids.    NOTE:    Five  portable  oxygen bottles/PBEs will be available for AE personnel on AE and NASA configurations.   Up 3.2.14.  Aircraft protective armor will be added as needed, and must be added into Ref. 7 of the DD Form 365-4. 3.2.15.  Some aircraft may be nose heavy due to armor installation and other modifications.  Actual amount of passengers/litter patients/paratroopers/cargo allowed onboard may vary as determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations. 3.2.16.  When  seating  passengers  next  to  cargo,  consideration  should  be  given  to  cargo (palletized/rolling  stock)  size  and  adequate  passenger  legroom.    For  cargo  width  up  to  76 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides.  For widths 77-96 inches, passengers may be seated on one side if the cargo is offset to one side laterally.  For widths 97 inches or greater, no passengers will be seated next to the cargo.  For cargo positioned within the wheel  well area:  cargo width up to 52 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides; for widths 53-72 inches, passengers may be seated on one side of cargo if offset; and for widths 73 inches and greater, no passengers will be seated in the wheel well. 3.3.  Troop Life Preserver.  If paratroopers are jumping near or over large bodies of water, the service  being  airdropped  will  furnish  required  life  preservers.    However,  life  preservers,  as indicated  in  applicable  configurations,  will  still  be  provided  as  required  to  cover  emergency ditching operations. 3.4.  Crew/Passenger/Troop  Drinking  Water.  Each  basic  configuration  provides  for  an adequate  amount of drinking water.  For example, a two-gallon water container will always be provided;  and  for  missions  requiring  more  water  in  accordance  with  Table  5.3,  additional containers  are  available.    Table  5.3  is  provided  to  assist  in  determining  water  quantities.  However, the table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to  cause mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers.  At no time will a mission be flown with no water aboard.  NOTE: When deploying to an austere environment or locations where a potable water source is unavailable, ensure a sufficient amount of water is onboard to complete the mission. AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA  9 DECEMBER 2009 19 3.5.

General.  This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  Load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  the  following emergency exits and safety aisles are available: 4.2.1.  Equipment  will  not  be  positioned  in  a  manner  that  obstructs  the  side  emergency escape hatches.  An obstruction is any equipment that prevents the effective means of rapid evacuation.  Litters  and  seats  erected  across  an  emergency  exit  are  not  considered  to  be  an obstruction. 4.2.2.  One  unobstructed  emergency  exit  will  be  available  for  each  20  passengers/troops.  (This does not restrict overwater flights if the three overhead escape hatches are available for egress.) 4.2.3.  When  passengers  are  being  airlifted,  an  unobstructed  aisleway  will  be  maintained  in the wheel well (C-130J pallet positions 4 and 5) (C-130J(S) pallet positions 3 & 4) and ramp area (C-130J pallet position 8) (C-130J(S) pallet position 6) to provide access to emergency exits.  In the wheel well area, the aisleway will be a minimum of 14 inches wide between the outer edge of the  cargo  and the  aircraft  and will begin  at the  cargo floor or  cargo handling system (CHS) outboard frame.  Tiedown equipment (463L nets, straps, chains, and devices) shall not normally be considered an obstruction.  The CHS outboard frame provides 8 inches of  the  14-inch  requirement  on  the  main  cargo  floor  (Figure  4.1.).    In  the  ramp  area,  the aisleway will be a minimum of 8 inches beginning at the outboard edge of the CHS outboard frame.    The  aisleway  should  normally  be  on  the  left  side  of  the  aircraft.    If  the  aisleway  is placed on the right side of the aircraft, then clearance to the right side of the aircraft must be maintained.  Additionally, access to aft latrine facilities requires a 20-inch clear area on the forward right side of cargo loaded on the ramp.  The clear area must be on the right side of the pallet. 4.2.4.  If  the  aisleway  requirement  in  paragraph  4.2.3.  cannot  be  achieved  on  missions carrying crew only or MEPs authorized by operations order/plan or DIRMOBFOR, then an aisleway  will  be  maintained  in  the  wheel  well  area  that  provides  a  minimum  of  14  inches between  the  outer  edge  of  the  cargo  and  aircraft  beginning  no  higher  than  36  inches  above the floor/pallet/platform or a minimum of 30 inches between the outer edge of cargo and the aircraft  beginning  no  higher  than  60  inches  above  the  floor/pallet/platform.    The  CHS outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the  main cargo floor (Figure  4.1).  MAJCOM/A3/DO  is  authorized  to  waive  this  requirement  based  on  MAJCOM/A3V evaluation and recommendation. 4.2.5.  During  airdrop  missions  loadmasters  shall  have  access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft  to accomplish tactical checklists. 4.2.6.  On all missions, cargo will be loaded in such a way that the crew will have access to the rear of the aircraft.  Loads in Section VI of TO 1C-130J-9 are specific and do not require a waiver. AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA  9 DECEMBER 2009 81 Figure 4.1.  Safety Aisles (Wheel Well Area W/Passengers). Figure 4.2.

The loadmaster is responsible for entering weight and balance data into the CNI-MU Wt. and Bal. pages, and transferring that information onto the DD Form 365-4 Form-F.  This  can  either  be  accomplished  manually,  or  electronically  utilizing  the  Automated  Form  F (AFF) program and printer.  Instructions for use of the AFF program can be found in the C-130 AFF training guide. 5.2.  Load  Planning.  The  cargo  load  must  be  planned  so  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  loaded aircraft  will  be  within  the  specified  forward  and  aft  limits  for  any  given  operating  condition.  Consideration  must  also  be  given  to  offload  sequence,  aircraft  limitations,  and  emergency jettisoning.    Math  charts  contained  in  TOs  1C-130(C)J-5-1,  1C-130J-5-1,  1C-130(C)J-5-2,  and 1C-130J-5-2 are tools, which may be used for load planning.  When the  fuel  load is  unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of MAC zero fuel. 5.3.  General  Instructions.  These  instructions  apply  to  Transport  Forms  F  using  simplified moments.  Copy the information the CNI-MU weight and balance pages onto the Form F, plus the heading information.  A copy of the completed DD Form 365-4 Form F shall be attached to the  flight  plan,  or  given  to  the  controlling  ground  agency,  quality  assurance,  transient  alert, maintenance, etc. 5.3.1.  DD  Form  365-4  Heading.    Enter  date,  mission  number,  aircraft  type,  serial  number, departure  and  destination  station  (name  or  ICAO  identifier),  home  station  of  aircraft,  and pilot's rank and last name. 5.3.2.  Limitations  Column.    Enter  the  appropriate  weight  and  CG  limits  for  the  planned mission using the following criteria:  the maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits specified  in  TO  1C-130J-1  will  not  be  exceeded.    Gross  weights  may  also  be  limited  by operating  conditions;  i.e.,  obstacle  clearance,  rate  of  climb,  weather  conditions,  altitude, runway/taxiway bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions.  The pilot will inform the loadmaster of any gross weight restrictions prior to mission planning so an accurate ACL may be obtained. 5.3.2.1.  Takeoff.    Unless  other  restrictions  are  imposed,  use  164,000  pounds  for  the  C-130J and 155,000 pounds for the C-130J (S). 5.3.2.2.  Landing.  Unless other landing restrictions such as assault landings are imposed, use  164,000  pounds  for  the  C-130J  and  155,000  pounds  for  the  C-130J  (S).    Subtract operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (references 9 and 23).  Refer to the T.O. 1C-130J-1 C-130J Flight Manual for assault landing limitations. 5.3.2.3.  Limiting Wing Fuel.  The CNI-MU is the primary method to compute Limiting Wing Fuel.  The limiting wing fuel chart in TO 1C-130J-1 is based on a 2.5 G maneuver load factor with  indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in  area "C" of the flight  manual limitation  charts.  Specific  mission  requirements  exceeding  area  "C"  limitations  must  be computed using the appropriate flight manual weight limitation charts AFI11-2C-130JV3ADDA  9 DECEMBER 2009 87 5.3.3.  Permissible C.G. Takeoff and Landing.  Compute the forward and aft center of gravity limitations  using  the  center  of  gravity  table  in  the  appropriate  TO  1C-130(C)J-5-2  or  1C-130J-5-2.  Leave the block entitled "Permissible CG Zero Fuel Wt" blank. 5.3.4.  Signature Blocks: 5.3.4.1.  Computed by:  Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate. 5.3.4.2.  Weight and Balance Authority:  Leave blank 5.3.4.3.  Pilot: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate. 5.4.  Instructions for Form F.  Copy the information from data entered in the CNI-MU Weight and  Balance  pages  and  handwrite,  type,  or  computer  generate  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  365-4.  NOTE:    In  the  remarks  section,  enter  a  breakdown  of  takeoff  fuel  weight  for  each  tank  to  the nearest 100 pounds and moments using the CNI-MU.  NOTE:  During engine running onloads or when planned ground times require, a combined load C/B may be used if a validated load plan is presented, and the aircraft is loaded per the load plan. 5.4.1.  Compute and enter zero  fuel  weight  and zero fuel  moment  by zeroing out  the Take-Off  and  Landing  fuels  on  the  Fuel  page.    Return  to  the  main  weight  and  balance  page  to calculate the Take-off and Landing Zero Fuel Weight.  After calculations have been entered return to the fuel page and return the fuel to its original state.  Zero fuel percent of MAC is not required, but may be helpful when targeting a 20-22 zero fuel percent of MAC. 5.4.2.  Reference 22.  If required, subtract airdrop load weight and moment from reference 21 or  changes  in  corrections  column  and  enter  as  adjusted  zero  fuel  weight/moment  on  first blank line in reference 22.
