The potential for a vehicle to rollover increases for vehicles with a high gross weight (20,000 lbs. or more) or a high center of gravity.  Check the vehicle’s data plate to determine if the vehicle is at higher risk for rollover. 5.4.7.  Foreign Object Damage (FOD).  Vehicle operators will remove FOD from tires during the daily vehicle inspection.  Before entering the airfield, a physical check for loose/unsecured objects and an inspection of the tire treads for FOD will be accomplished, with the exception of responses to active, real world emergency situations.  5.4.7.1.  Any vehicle which has been driven on an unpaved surface will have a tire FOD inspection accomplished prior to re-entering the airfield area.  Vehicles that frequent the flightline will be equipped with a FOD picker and a covered FOD container. 5.4.7.2.  FOD picker will be etched with the vehicle number painted on red or orange (or have a red streamer attached). 5.4.7.3.  FOD picker will be annotated on vehicle inspection form. 5.4.7.4.  FOD containers will be identified with the letters "FOD"  and will be emptied daily. 5.4.7.5.  FOD checks are performed so that aircraft damage can be kept at a minimum.         5.4.8.  Location and use of tire jack and accessories.  5.4.9.  Changing dual tires.  5.4.9.1.  Chock the wheel on the opposite side of the ambulance and diagonal from the tire that is flat.  5.4.9.2.

Never use the jack on any part of the underbody other than the axle.  5.4.9.2.2.   Do not raise the entire vehicle at side rail, with jack midway between the front and rear wheels or permanent body damage may result. 5.4.9.2.3.   Do not allow lifting plate fingers to contact the axle cover plate when lifting a rear axle housing. 5.4.9.2.4.   If  the  vehicle  is  equipped  with  a  stabilizer  bar,  do  not  lift  at  rear  axle housing.  5.4.9.3.  Rear duals on the ambulance should be taken off one at a time.  Before raising the vehicle, loosen all lug nuts. Employees must exercise extreme caution when working with split-rim wheels.  5.4.9.4.  Raise the vehicle and take off the lug nuts in a star pattern, placing them on the ground so that you will be able to put them back on in the same order.  5.4.9.5.  When tightening lug nuts on any type of rim, hand tighten all lug nuts while the vehicle is still jacked up.  5.4.9.6.  Lower vehicle to the ground then tighten lug nuts with a lug wrench starting in star pattern to equalize pressure of the rim to the hub of the axle.  5.5. Ambulance Operation.  5.5.1.  Emergency light and siren operation.  5.5.1.1.  Only used in “life/limb” emergencies.  5.5.1.2.  Drivers of emergency vehicles will not assume right of way over other vehicles and will comply with state and local traffic laws and military regulations governing vehicle operations.  5.5.1.3.  Speed limit of ambulances will NOT exceed the legal speed limit.  5.5.1.4.  The use of emergency devices (such as flashing colored lights and sirens) may be used only for their intended purpose…When in use, all warning devices will be considered by the operator as a request for other vehicles to yield the right of way.  5.5.1.5.  Under no circumstances will the use of warning devices be construed to mean such signals give full clearance to operate the vehicle without due regard to life, property and traffic laws.  5.5.1.6.  When responding to an emergency call, drivers of emergency vehicles will stop at all stop signs and signals and proceed only when the intersection is clear of approaching traffic.  Drivers of emergency vehicles will, at all times, use extreme care and caution to safe vehicle operations.  5.5.1.7.  During routine transfer of non-critical patients, warning devices on ambulances will not be used and all traffic laws will be observed.     5.5.2.1.  Proper channel(s) for use.  5.5.2.2.  Terminology.  5.5.2.2.1.   “______ responding.”  5.5.2.2.2.   “______ on scene.”        5.5.2.2.3.   “______ enroute to _______/destination.” 5.5.2.2.4.   “______ in quarters or station.” 5.5.2.2.5.   “______ copies.” 5.5.2.2.6.   “______ what’s your location?” 5.5.2.2.7.   “Contact via landline.” 5.5.2.2.8.   “Disregard.” 5.5.2.

Explain map use and identify medical facility location(s).  5.5.4.  Starting the ambulance.  5.5.4.1.  Ensure the transmission control is in park and the parking brake is applied.  5.5.4.2.  The Master Switch on the driver’s console must be in the OFF position before starting the engine.  5.5.4.3.  Turn the battery switch ON.  5.5.4.4.  Turn the starting key to the extreme right, engaging the motor.  5.5.4.5.  Release the key once the engine starts.  5.5.5.  Turning on the electrical systems.  5.5.5.1.  With the engine running, turn on the Master Switch.  5.5.5.2.  The equipment switches may turned on in any sequence, however, only turn on one switch at a time.    5.5.6.  Stationary vehicle operation.  5.5.6.1.  When the vehicle is to remain stationary, engage the electric fast idle throttle.  Increasing the throttle idle elevates alternator output, enabling the system to support the total electrical load.  5.5.6.2.  Watch the ammeter.  If it shows discharge, turn off as many electrical accessories as possible to prevent system failure.  5.5.6.3.  Do not allow the ammeter to remain in the discharge region.  5.5.7.  Describe the operational procedures for:  5.5.7.1.  Emergency responses.  5.5.7.2.  Being stopped at an accident scene.  5.5.7.3.  Being en route to the medical facility.  5.5.7.4.  Arriving at the medical facility/waiting at the medical facility.  5.5.7.5.  Inflight emergency.  5.5.8.  Vehicle shutdown.  5.5.8.1.  Set parking brake.  5.5.8.2.

Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. • o o o o o • • Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Safety inspection. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.
