TRAINER GUIDANCE 2b Can do most parts of the task.  Needs help only on hardest parts.  Can determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. None •  AFI 32-1001, Operations Management, Sep 2005  •  Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 32-1004 V3, Working in the Operations Flight Facility Maintenance, Chapter 4 4B051 Copies of several previously reviewed work requests. Conduct hands-on training and evaluation. Copies of self-help/work requests previously reviewed can be useful when training this item. Select a variety of self-help and work requests from the flight’s administrative files and remove any documents that address finding of the previous review. The requests selected should cover a broad range of proposed work situations and potential OEH threats. Have the trainee review the work requests and identify and evaluate the potential OEH threats and recommend control measures. Compare the trainee’s conclusions to those produced during the initial review. Given a work order request, determine the potential OEH hazards associated with the work order (project) and recommend appropriate control measures completing all checklist items with limited trainer assistance on only the hardest parts.   1 AFQTP 4B051-1                 Journeyman Training Guide:  Program Management TASK STEPS  1.  Log the work order request, if applicable (*See local requirements). 2.  Review the work order request documents to develop a conceptual model of the project (achieve an understanding of the work to be performed).1 3.  Anticipate OEH threats that could result.2 4.  Determine characteristics of each identified OEH health threat (e.g., toxicity, volatility, transmissibility). 5.  Determine, if possible, exposure parameters (e.g., pathway, duration, concentration). 6.  Identify populations at risk of exposure via all potential pathways.3 7.  Perform an exposure assessment for each population at risk of exposure.4 8.  Analyze the risk.5 9.  Determine appropriate control measures, if needed.6 10.  Document control measure recommendations, as required. 11.  Communicate identified risks and control measures, as necessary.7   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  * Local requirements may or may not require shop personnel to log-in individual work order requests.   NOTES:  1.  AFPAM 32-1004V3 mentions BE must review work requests for health or environmental hazards, but does not cover specifically how the review is conducted.  The reference explains the work order process from a Civil Engineering Facility Maintenance perspective including the review process, evaluation of work orders, and managing work orders which could provide the trainee with a broader understanding of the entire process.   2.  When identifying threats, consider such things as: •  Threats from raw materials (e.g., paints, coatings, cleaners, adhesives). •  Threats from construction activities (e.g., physical hazards, materials to be demolished or disturbed that may contain health hazards such as asbestos or lead, confined spaces).  3.  When identifying populations at risk, consider such things as: • • Individuals performing work. Individuals in the vicinity that could be exposed indirectly (e.g., adjacent workplaces, workplaces sharing same ventilation system as area where work is to be performed, workplaces downwind of ventilation exhaust).  4.  An exposure assessment is a process of estimating or calculating potential exposure of a health threat for an individual or population at risk.  The assessment includes professional judgment, calculations based on estimates or models, actual measurements, collection and analysis of samples, and statistical evaluation.   Previous estimates of exposure from similar operations (whether co-located or not) should also be considered.  5.  When analyzing the risk of the task, research to see if this is a routine task that will need to be addressed during routine assessments.   6.   If another unit/facility on base is doing the same task, review the controls they use to determine what controls to recommend for this task.  2 AFQTP 4B051-1  7. If the work will be done by a contractor, ensure all applicable AF Standards/base regulations are being met and followed. (e.g., RSO notified of any radiation material, CE notified of anything that would affect the water main system).
