Description.  The outline of the responsibilities of organizations and individuals involved in Defense  Joint  Military  Pay  System  (DJMS)  has  changed  due  to  consolidation.    Detailed instructions  for  specific  transactions  are  in  applicable  chapters.    Whenever  procedures, programs, or products do not support the requirements of the organization or member, notify the responsible office as shown in this chapter. 1.2.  Financial  Services  Officer  (FSO).  The  FSO,  as  the  base-level  administrator  of  DJMS, provides  adequate  pay  service  to  the  member  by  resolving  pay  problems  and  inquiries addressed  by the member. Regardless of the source of pay-affecting input, that is, category I, II, III,  IV,  V  (per  Chapter  2),  the  FSO  acts  as  mediator  in  obtaining  information  from  outside sources  so  that  the  member's  pay  problem  can  be  resolved  without  referring  the  member  to another office. 1.2.1.  Pay  Record  Accessibility  (PRA).    The  FSO,  Deputy,  or  a  responsible  supervisor  is responsible for a semiannual audit of pay records of all personnel assigned to the financial management (FM) organization at the base. 1.2.1.1.  Applicability.  PRA control applies to accounts of: 1.2.1.1.1.  FM Personnel with DJMS input capability. 1.2.1.1.2.  Administrators for LeaveWeb and Defense Milpay Office (DMO). 1.2.1.1.3.  A random  sample  of  any  military  relatives  of  the  two  above, regardless of base assignment. 1.2.1.1.4.  A random sample of other, locally assigned FM military personnel 1.2.1.2.  Actions.   The FSO,  deputy,  or  a  responsible  supervisor  (designated  in  writing) maintains  AF  Form  2070,  JUMPS  Pay  Accessibility  Roster  (Figure  1.1),  as  specified below: 1.2.1.2.1.  Remakes roster semiannually in May and November  each  year in original and  one  copy.    Currently,  the  flagged  records  are  included  on  the  listing  obtained from  the  OFFLINE  reporting  control  system (see the OFFLINE users guide), every quarter.  Ensure the listings are downloaded  when  produced and saved until required to perform the audit. 1.2.1.2.2.  Adds new personnel to the roster as PRA is established.  Submits an SC04 transaction  with  a  0  (zero)  in  PRA-INDICATOR  to  establish  the  PRA  indicator.  Deletes  personnel  departing  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS),  separating,  or retiring, and no longer subject to PRA by not putting them on the next roster (do not delete  from  current  roster).    Submits  an  SC04  transaction  with  an  asterisk  (*)  in PRA-INDICATOR to delete the PRA indicator. 46 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1.2.1.2.3.  Includes in column A of the roster, full name (last, first, middle) and SSN of  each  military  member  or  employee  of  the  activity  subject  to  PRA.    Military member  or  employee  complete  columns  B,  C,  and  D.    Enter  "None"  in  column  C and "NA" in column D if not applicable. 1.2.1.3.  Irregular Payments on PRA Accounts.  Follow these rules: 1.2.1.3.1.  Consider each irregular payment on its individual merit and circumstances. 1.2.1.3.2.  Advise  approving  official  if  a  member  is  receiving  frequent  irregular payments. 1.2.1.3.3.  Do not condone offsetting partial payments. 1.2.1.3.4.  Counsel  member  who  receives  more  than  three  partial  payments  in  a 6-month period. 1.2.1.3.5.  Enter appropriate explanatory remark on supporting voucher. 1.2.1.4.  Audit.  The FSO, deputy, or a designated supervisor obtains the latest PRA listing produced  by  the  Off-line  Reporting  Control  System.  For  members  not  appearing  on  the Offline Reporting Control System list, request processing of an SC04 to establish the PRA indicator. Obtain a current copy of the  Master Military Pay  Account (MMPA)  or review the  computer  screen  of  the  MMPA  for  each  individual  on  the PRA  roster.  Although all relatives of members or employees are entered on the roster, only members serviced by the local input station identifier (ISI) are subject to a PRA audit.  In addition to the semiannual requirement, PRA audits are required any time a member, subject to PRA control, departs PCS, is relieved of duties, separates, or retires.  Proceed with PRA audit as follows: 1.2.1.4.1.  Review the Offline Reporting Control list or the  member's current MMPA to  see  if  there  has  been  a  $100  net  change  of  combined  mid-month,  end-of-month, and  carried  forward  amounts  for  current  month  compared  to  prior  month,  or  a monthly  leave  increase  of  over  2.5  days,  or  any  leave  or  indebtedness  cancellation.  Audit record as follows: 1.2.1.4.1.1.  Obtain MMPA printout if necessary. 1.2.1.4.1.2.  Examine  the  source  documents  supporting  actions  identified  in 1 above and determine that transactions are correctly supported and processed. 1.2.1.4.2.  If  member  does  not  have  a  $100  net  change  or  a  leave  increase  over 2.5 days, further audit is not required. 1.2.1.4.3.  Show  that  all  transactions  have  been  processed  properly  by  signing  and dating  the roster.  Original  signature is required  on the  AF  Forms 2070 submitted to the Denver Federal Records Center (DFRC). 1.2.1.4.4.  Send  completed  PRA  roster  to  Customer  Support  at  the  end  of  the semiannual period for inclusion in the shipment of source documents to DFRC.  The roster that is prepared in May is submitted with the quarterly document submission in July,  and  the  roster  that  is  prepared  in  November  is  submitted  with  January’s document  submission.    Keep  duplicate  copy  per  Air  Force  Records  Disposition Schedule. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 47  1.2.2.  Organization  of  Military  Pay  Functional  Area.    FSO  responsibility  for  DJMS processing  is exercised  within a  military pay area.  The organizational  structure must allow for  a  controlled  flow  of  documentation  and  processing,  enhanced  customer  service,  and security,  by  separation  of  duties  and  responsibilities.    Examples  of  variations  are:    pay teams,  responsible  for  all  organizational  function  within  each  team,  or  special  action sections.  The  FSO  makes  sure  that  under  any  organizational  structure  established,  the controls, security, and responsibilities of the military pay section are not compromised. 1.3.  FSO Servicing Policy. 1.3.1.  Active duty Air Force members located on an installation with a host command FSO are  serviced  by  the  host  active  duty  FSO,  regardless  of  command  affiliation.    Reserve members  of  separate  units  collocated  on  an  installation  with  an  FSO  are  serviced  by  that FSO regardless of gaining command affiliation. 1.3.2.  Air Force members assigned to a unit geographically separated from any FSO (a GSU) are serviced  by  the  FSO  that  is  nearest  to  the  duty  location  of  the  member,  where  feasible.  FSO servicing responsibility  should  be aligned  so that the  military  population is  supported for  both  personnel  and  pay  service at  the  same location,  whenever  possible.   For  members serviced by active duty FSOs: 1.3.2.1.  If GSU  members receive  personnel  support  from a  collocated MPF,  the  nearest FSO furnishes pay support. 1.3.2.2.  If GSU  members  do  not receive  collocated MPF  support, the nearest FSO that has a collocated MPF furnishes support provided the distance is not significantly greater than the nearest MPF or FSO. 1.3.2.3.  Where the distance from the collocated MPF/FSO is significantly greater than the nearest MPF or FSO, the nearest FSO furnishes pay service to the GSU. 1.3.3.  Usually,  FSOs  nearest  the  installation  service  all  units  located  on  an  installation separated  from  an  FSO  (GSUs)  regardless  of  their  command  affiliation.    The  host  GSU provides the liaison between the servicing FSO and other GSUs at the installation. 1.3.4.  Servicing  FSO  for  Newly  Established  Units.  The  parent  major  command  of  newly established units determines the servicing FSO for the unit based on the criteria contained in paragraph 1-3.  The parent major command advises the gaining FSO and major command of the  selected  FSO  by  message.  Provide  an  information  copy  of  the  message  to  the  gaining major  command/DPM,  Headquarters  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (HQ  AFPC/DPMYCO) and AFAFO as well as DFAS-JMPA/DE.  The message includes unit designation, personnel accounting symbol (PAS) code, and the effective date of the action.  The action is considered approved unless the gaining major command or AFAFO advises the parent major command of their disagreement. 1.3.5.  Forwarding  FSO  Records,  Source  Documents,  and  Correspondence  Between  FSOs.  Use  the PAS  directory  (HAF-DPM(M)7104)  to  determine  the  gaining  or  losing  FSO.   Use AFDIR 37-135 to obtain the correct mailing address for FSOs. 48 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1.3.6.  Deviations.   Obtain  any  deviations  from  the  above  policy  in  writing  from  AFAFO.  Request  waiver through losing  major  command to  gaining  major  command.  Gaining  major command  will  forward  concurrence  or  non-concurrence  to  AFAFO  for  their  approval  or disapproval.  Indicate name and location of unit, number of accounts involved, proposed date of transfer, and rationale for requesting the waiver.  Also, indicate location of servicing MPF. 1.4.  Chief  of  Customer  Service/Customer  Support.  Under  the  direction  of  the  FSO  or deputy, the  chief  of  Customer  Service/Customer  Support  assigns  duties  and responsibilities  to  the  appropriate  sub-unit  within  Customer  Service/Customer  Support.    The chief of Customer Service/Customer Support also: 1.4.1.  Supervises overall Customer Service/Customer Support operations. 1.4.2.

The Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) used by the Army and the Air Force  is  covered  by  the  acronym  DJMS-AC.    This  chapter  provides  a  general  overview  of DJMS-AC from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service - Denver (DFAS-DE) perspective. 2.2.  Terms Explained: 2.2.1.  MMPA.    A  Master  Military  Pay  Account  (MMPA)  is  maintained  for  every  active duty  Army  and  Air  Force  member  including  Air  Force  Academy  Cadets.    It  contains  all entitlement,  deduction, allotment, collection, payments, status, leave and 12 months' history data.  The MMPA is always in a projected end-of-current month and next  month posture.  There  are  two  central  files  containing  MMPAs  -  one  at  DFAS-DE  for  all  Air  Force members  paid  by  DJMS  and  one  at  DFAS-IN  for  all  Army  members  paid  by  DJMS-AC.  The MMPA is subdivided into seven groups of major data. 2.2.1.1.  The  fixed  data  group  contains  data  of  a  fixed  size,  in  a  fixed  location  within each member’s record, that is always present and used consistently during daily updates. Examples of fixed data are member’s name, SSN, grade, and basic pay entitlement. 2.2.1.2.  Data in the other six groups are variable and present only when applicable to the member.  These  groups  are  comprised  of  allotments,  futures,  suspenses,  entitlements, deductions and history entries. 2.2.2.  Category  of  Input.   Identifies  the responsible  office or area  for input to DJMS.   The five categories of input are: 2.2.2.1.  Category  I  Transactions  -  generated  as  a  by-product  of  updating  the  Advanced Personnel Data System (APDS). 2.2.2.2.  Category II Transactions - originate with the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) and are submitted direct to DFAS-DE. 2.2.2.3.  Category  III  Transactions  -  flow  directly  from  the  source  to  the  Financial Service  Office  (FSO)  for  input  to  the  centralized  MMPA.  These  transactions  do  not update APDS. 2.2.2.4.  Category  IV  Transactions  -  DFAS-DE  computer-generated  changes.    These event-oriented changes are created (within the computer) by other inputs. 2.2.2.5.  Category  V  Transactions  -  DFAS-DE  operating  directorate  input  based  on information received from sources or by means outside the normal DJMS input channels. 2.2.3.  Input  Sources.  There are  eleven principle  sources of input  to  the  central  site  system. They are: 2.2.3.1.  FSOs - Category III 2.2.3.2.  AFPC - Category II 2.2.3.3.  Army Finance Offices (FOs) - Category III AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 57  2.2.3.4.  Military Personnel Flights (MPFs) - Category I 2.2.3.5.  Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) - Category III 2.2.3.6.  Joint Personal Property Shipping Office (JPPSO) - Category III 2.2.3.7.  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  -  Denver  Center's  Directorate  of Military Pay Operations (DFAS-DE/FJ) - Category V 2.2.3.8.  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  -  Indianapolis  Center's  Military  Pay Operations Directorate (DFAS-IN-J) - Category V 2.2.3.9.  Other Service departments - Category V 2.2.3.10.  DJMS/DJMS-AC system generated transactions - Category IV 2.2.3.11.  Air Force Aid Society (AFAS) - Category III 2.2.4.  FID.    The  format  ID  (FID)  identifies  the  type  of  transaction  being  processed. FID 66, for example, denotes Interim Variable Housing Allowance (IVHA). 2.2.5.  AI.    The  action  indicator  (AI)  notifies  the  system  of  the  action  to  be  taken  on  the affected  format.    An  AI  of  01,  for  example,  indicates  a  start.  Therefore,  a  6601  tells  the system to start IVHA. 2.2.6.  Summary  Accounts  File.    The  summary  accounts  file  summarizes  military  pay activity  data  contained  in  each  MMPA  for  the  current  month  and  next  month.    Like  the MMPA,  data  in  this  file  is  also  in  a  projected  end-of-current  month  position.    It  contains certain details for each entitlement, number of members drawing that entitlement by grade, and  other  pay  determining  factors.    This  file  also  reflects  how  the  pay  is  distributed.    It provides the  basis for  most end-of-month reports and data needed to respond to many kinds of  questions  concerning  entitlements.  Whenever  an  item  changes  in  the  MMPA,  a corresponding  adjustment  must  occur  in  the  summary  accounts  file  so  it  is  in  balance  with the MMPAs.  To ensure this equalization  between these two files after each update, MMPA control  totals  are  compared  to  the  detail  summary  account  transactions.    The  summary accounts  file  is  also  used  to  prepare  the  monthly  Summary  of  Military  Pay  Obligation (SOMPO)  report  sent  to  the  appropriate  military  personnel  fund  managers.    Personnel program planners and fund managers also use data from the summary accounts file. 2.2.7.  Statistical File.  The statistical file is updated as transactions are processed.  This file summarizes statistical transaction data to provide the volume of activity processed during the month as well as the type, source, and any rejects that occurred.  Input timeliness, that is, the lag between the  effective date of the event and the date the transaction was processed at the appropriate  central  site  processing  center,  is  tracked  as  well.    The  statistical  file  identifies high  volume  items, high  volume rejects, and  where they  come  from,  which  enables DFAS to identify  problem  areas.   This  file is used as a guide  for  examination  of  the  system  and manuals to determine  where  correction, clarification,  or refinement are needed. 2.2.8.  Central  Pay  Authorizations.  The  central  pay  authorization  files  contain  payroll information for members who are centrally paid by DFAS-DE and DFAS-IN.  These files are used  to  produce  central  payrolls  and  must  balance  to  the  related  amounts  in  the  MMPAs.  There are two types of pay authorizations. 58 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.2.8.1.  First  is  the  regular  pay  authorization,  used  to  pay  members  at  mid-month and/or  end-of-month  paydays.  This  authorization  is  generated  each  time  an  input transaction is processed that causes a member to be due more or less money for the month. If  a  member  has  elected  to  send  his  or  her  check  to  a  financial  organization,  the authorization  is  maintained  in  the  appropriate  central  pay  authorization  file  used  to generate  electronic  funds  transfer  to  arrive  at  that  organization  on  payday.    If  the member  opts  to  receive  a  check,  the  pay  authorization  is  maintained  in  the appropriate  Local  Pay  Master  File  and  a  paper  check  is  cut  and  mailed  to  arrive  on payday. 2.2.8.2.  The  second type of pay authorization is  the one-time pay authorization, used by  the  base-level  FSO  to  make  one-time  payments,  such  as  reenlistment  bonus, continuation pay, or separation pay. 2.2.9.  Feedback.  There are several types of feedback from DJMS-AC.  They include:   This  type  acknowledges  input  from 2.2.9.1.  Routine  Administrative  Feedback. personnel  offices as  well  as  FSOs  and  other  input  sources,  rejected  and  local  personnel input, and replies to certain inquiries that are sent  directly to the input source.   An error description  accompanies  each  reject  explaining  what  was  wrong  with  the  transaction.  The input source must, of course, correct and resubmit the transaction as appropriate. 2.2.9.2.  Daily  Transaction  Register.    The  Daily  Transaction  Register  (DTR)  is  the second major feedback item generated by DJMS-AC.  It is a comprehensive record of all transactions input into the system and transactions generated by the system as a result of processing  certain  transactions.  See  paragraph  2-8  for  an  explanation  of  the  various sections  of  the  DTR.    A  DTR  is  prepared  for  each  FSO/FO  servicing  members  whose MMPAs are affected by transactions processed.  A DTR is also  prepared  for  central  site activities  for  their  input.    The  DTR  includes  all  input,  including  computer-generated transactions,  processed  in  the  update.    It  is  then  produced  on  microfiche  for  the  FSO, FO,  MPF,  DFAS-DE,  and  DFAS-IN.    Hard  copy  and  on-line  inquiry,  through  Report Management System (RMS), are available to certain central site activities.  The DTR is a comprehensive  record  of  transactions  and  a  major  reference  tool.  Its  importance  is highlighted by the fact that it provides: 2.2.9.2.1.  acknowledgment of receipt of transactions, 2.2.9.2.2.  control over rejected transactions, 2.2.9.2.3.  notice of transactions internally generated by the system and input by other sources, 2.2.9.2.4.  a status report which enables the FSO/FO to determine whether a member's MMPA  was  correctly  updated  or  whether  the  transaction  rejected  or  was  deferred pending receipt of additional data, 2.2.9.2.5.  suspense notices of additional actions required to process a transaction, 2.2.9.2.6.  follow-up notices for suspense items, and 2.2.9.2.7.  an auditable record for use by local operators and auditors. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 59  2.2.9.3.  Leave  and  Earnings  Statement.    The  Leave  and  Earnings  Statement  (LES)  is produced  monthly  for  each  member.    After  end-of-month  cutoff,  before  the  MMPA  is restructured  to  the  next  month's  position,  LES  data  is  extracted  and  formatted.    This statement  contains  an  itemized  account  of  all  pay  and  leave  items  contained  in  the MMPA  and  an  explanation  of  all  changes  occurring  during  the  month.    LES  data  is maintained  on the database  for 12  months.    An inquiry  system  allows  the  user  to  view this  information  and  research  questions  regarding  the  member's  MMPA.    (For  more information on the LES, see Chapter 7). 2.2.10.  By-Others Transaction.  Transaction input by the MPF, AFPC, DFAS-DE, or other FSO's which affect a member's MMPA.  Transaction processing details are transmitted to the servicing FSO (PCN UH099CA11) after each DFAS-DE update. 2.2.11.  Payments  and  Collections.    DFAS-DE  records  and  summarizes  entitlements  and disbursements  for  military  pay  on  DD  Form  117,  Military  Pay  Distribution  Voucher,  and sends summary data monthly to the Air Force military pay fund manager for use in obligating funds.  Local FSOs pay from or collect into a clearing account.  Separate clearing accounts are provided for officer and enlisted personnel. 2.2.11.1.  Regular  Payments.    Members  elect  whether  they  want  to  be  paid  by  check or  have  DFAS-DE  send their  checks  to  their banks.  They also elect to be paid once or twice a month. 2.2.11.1.1.  Check  Payments.    Paychecks  are  printed  at  DFAS-DE.    The  money list  is  in  straight SSN sequence officer and enlisted intermixed and is maintained at DFAS-DE.  Regular mid-month (MM), end-of-month (EOM) and monthly payments are  based  on  pay  authorizations  generated  by  DJMS  processing.    Payment  is  made from either the officer or enlisted clearing account. 2.2.11.1.2.  Central  Payments.  DFAS-DE  makes regular  MM and EOM payments  to the  bank  designated  by  member  and  updates  member's  MMPA.    DFAS  Form  703, DFAS  Military  Net  Pay  Advice,  is  forwarded  at  MM  to  each  member  who participates in the Direct Deposit program. 2.2.11.2.  Special  Payments.  Partial and  casual payments are authorized on the  basis of data in the  MMPA  and  LES  history  prints,  and  are  paid  locally  by  the  FSO.    Advance payments  are  authorized  per  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  32,  and  are  paid  by  the FSO.   These payments are reported to DFAS-DE daily. 2.2.11.3.  One-Time  Payments.    Selective  reenlistment  bonus  (SRB),  continuation  pay, separation  pay,  and  other  one-time  payments  are  made  locally  by  the  FSO  based  on pay  authorizations  received  from  DFAS-DE.    They  are  due  and  payable  on  date projected  action  is  complete;  for  example,  SRB  would  be  due  on  date  member reenlists.   Payment data is reported to DFAS-DE immediately after payment. 2.2.11.4.  Cross-Disbursing Payments.  Air Force FSOs may make irregular payments to members  of  other  Services  and  disbursing  officers  of  other  Services  may  make irregular  payments  to  Air  Force  members.    Report  these  payments  to  the  member's Service per Chapter 77. 60 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.2.11.5.  Collections.  Local FSOs  make  collections  for  indebtedness, temporary lodging allowance (TLA) overpayments and canceled and undeliverable checks.  The FSO reports collections, See Chapter 69 through 72 for procedures. together  with  necessary to  DFAS  daily.   identifying information, 2.2.11.6.  Underpayment  or Overpayment  Vouchers  of $10 or  Less.  The  cost  to  process over  or  underpayment  vouchers  of  $10  or  less  exceeds  the  amount  to  be  collected  or disbursed.  Do  not  prepare  vouchers  for  over  or  underpayments  of  $10  or  less.  Per DoDFMR Vol 5, chapter 11, paragraph 110208, if a disbursement to a payee is overpaid by $10  or  less,  there  is  no  requirement  to  collect  the  overpayment.  Similarly,  if  a disbursement to a payee is underpaid by $10 or less, do not issue a supplemental payment unless specifically requested by the payee. 2.2.12.  Edits.   DJMS  category  III  input  is  subjected  to  edits  to  make  sure  only  acceptable and valid  data are used  to update the MMPA.  Incorrect or invalid data is  rejected  from the system. 2.2.12.1.  Supplied Codes.  If immediate recording is essential and an invalid or missing code  is  not critical  to DFAS-DE processing, the  system supplies an arbitrary  valid  code to  make  processing  possible.  In  most  cases  the  supplied  code  will  be  correct.  (For example, if the code for sex of the member is missing or invalid, the system supplies the code for male and continues to process the transaction.)  The supplied code is identified by  an  error  code  and  is  printed  on  the  reject  list  (UH499CA46)  and  on  the  DTR.  Personnel at base level review all supplied codes and either verify that they are correct or submit input transactions to change any erroneous ones. 2.2.12.2.  Rejects.  Data which fails initial edits must be corrected before additional data can  be  entered.  Some  errors  found  in  the  minimal  edits  of  input  transactions  make  it impossible  to  access  the  MMPA  (for  example,  invalid  name  or  SSN);  when  this happens,  the  transaction  is  assigned  appropriate  error  codes  and  rejected  to  the  input source.  In most transactions one error causes the entire transaction to reject; however, if the  MMPA  can  be  accessed,  all  errors  (up  to  a  maximum  of  six)  are  identified  before DFAS-DE rejects a transaction to the input source.   Base personnel research all errors, determine action required and, when applicable, correct and resubmit the transaction. 2.3.  Controls.  DJMS-AC  was  designed  with  as  much  an  eye  toward  internal  control  as  to service.  Without  these  controls,  the  possibilities  for  fraud  are  endless.    The  Federal  Managers' Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA) of 1982, the Auditors General of the Air Force and the Army, and  the Comptroller General  of the United States require safeguards  be in place to provide the most accurate and timely pay service to the members  while  maintaining  fiscal responsibility on behalf of the Government.   To this end, controls in place include, but are not limited to: 2.3.1.  Source  Documents.  Hard  copy  source  documents  are  mailed  to  the  Denver  Federal Records Center (DFRC) on a quarterly basis, by the 15th of the month following the end of the quarter along with the Daily Transaction Listing (DTL) reflecting the date they were submitted. Bases that have cutover to the AFFSC for processing only submit those documents that do not require  processing  to  the  MMPA  (i.e.,  AF  2070  for  PRA)  because  the  source  documents processed  at  the  AFFSC  are  maintained  electronically  in  EIM  and  hardcopy  submission  of those  documents  is  no  longer  required.  Base-level  retention  requirement,  for  documents scanned and sent to the AFFSC, is 90 days which allows time to ensure the scanned documents AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 61  were  legible  when  received  by  the  Center.  These  supporting  documents,  as  well  as  the payment vouchers with amounts actually paid, are kept available for audit, quality examination reviews and claims settlements. 2.3.2.  Pay Record  Accessibility (PRA)  Audit.  Individuals  who  have access to  military  pay records are subject to PRA audit.  These audits are required on a semi-annual basis and help ensure that this access to MMPAs is  not misused. (For  more information  on PRA audit,  see Chapter 1 and Chapter 6.) 2.3.3.  Quality examination is required at base-level and at central site.  This review provides a variety of controls, from minimizing collusion to reducing rejects.  In addition, the quality examination function can alert the FSO to trends or problems developing locally. 2.4.  Documentation.  DJMS processing at base level involves the preparation of Category I and III  source  documents  by  units,  activities  outside  the  FSO,  subject  matter  areas  (SMAs)  within the FSO, and MPFs. The FSO or MPF processes these documents. 2.4.1.  Supporting  documents.    All  entitlements  and  deductions  on  behalf  of  the  US Government  require  signed  and  certified  documents  completely  explaining  each  action taken.   Transactions  not affecting pay and allowances,  but required to  maintain a  member's pay  account,  must  also  be  documented.  All  documents  must  be  prepared  in  ink  or  by typewriter.  Do  not  use  lead  pencil.  The  original  voucher  must  not be a  carbon impression. Where copies of original documents are specified as DJMS supporting documents, they must be legible carbon or non-deteriorating reproduced (bond type) copies. 2.4.1.1.  All corrections will be done in pen and ink and initialed by the individual making the  correction.    Draw  only  one  line  through  the  incorrect  entry.   Do  not  obliterate  the entry being corrected.  Never use whiteout ink or correction tape since these methods are not permanent. 2.4.1.2.  FSO  is  responsible  for  the  accuracy  and  validity  of  all  information transmitted  to  DFAS-DE  for  use  in  updating  MMPAs.  Source  documents  containing questionable  information  or  facts  which  do  not  justify  creation  of  a  DJMS  transaction are rejected.  FSOs may use their own judgment about the evidence. 2.4.1.3.  Signature  requirements.  When  military  pay  procedures  require  that  a  member sign  documents  to  support  payment  of  pay  and  allowances,  the  member  must personally sign the documents.  If the member is unable to sign: 2.4.1.3.1.  Enter  an  X  mark,  in  parenthesis,  between  the  member's  given  name  (or  names)  and  surname.    It  must  be  witnessed  by  one  disinterested  person  whose signature and address are entered immediately after the member's name. 2.4.1.3.2.  If  physically  unable  to  sign  by  mark,  the  member  may  authorize  another person  to  sign.    This  must  be  done  in  the  presence  of  the  member  and  another witness.  Certificates are executed by the person who wrote the signature and by the witness.    These  must  state  that  the  signature  was  made  at  the  request  of  and  in  the presence of the member and a witness. 2.4.1.3.3.  Any circumstances not covered by the above should be referred to AFAFO for guidance. 62 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.4.1.4.  Power  of  Attorney  (POA).    An  FSO  can  release  pay  information  to  a dependent  or an attorney-in-fact if the member has provided a POA to the dependent or attorney-in-fact  that  authorizes  such  disclosure,  or  if  the  member  has  otherwise  given notarized  written  consent  to  the  FSO  authorizing  disclosure  of  pay  information  to  the dependent.  As long as the FSO has the member's notarized written consent to the release of  information,  the  requirements  of  the  Privacy  Act  are  satisfied (AFI 33-332,  Privacy Act Program). 2.4.1.4.1.  All  POAs  and  written  consents  must  contain  clear  and  unambiguous language describing the powers given to the holder of the POA or written consent. 2.4.1.4.2.  A  member  may  designate,  by  POA  only,  that  another  person  pick  up his/her Treasury check. 2.4.1.4.3.  DJMS source documents, and claims for pay and allowances, can only be made by the member and will not be accepted if signed by an attorney-in-fact using a POA.   Use of a General  Power of  Attorney is not acceptable in these types  of pay matters.   The  special  POA,  however,  can  be  completed  in  the  remarks  block  of  the General  POA.    If  the  General  POA  is  used,  only  what  is  written  in  the  remarks block  is  valid.     DoDFMR  7000.14-R,  Volume  5  requires  that  when  an  individual authorizes  another  individual  to  pick  up  checks  on  his  or  her  behalf,  the  POA authorizing such must be prepared on a Special Power of Attorney or by an Attorney at Law.  Accordingly, if the special POA is prepared on the General POA and will be used to authorize another individual to pick up checks on the member’s behalf, it must be prepared by an attorney at law. 2.4.1.4.4.  An  exception  to  the  policy  in  subparagraph  2.4.1.4.3  above  is  that  a Special  POA  may  be  used  to  establish,  change,  or  stop  an  allotment.   The  Special POA  must  specifically  state  the  effective  date  of  the  Special  POA,  to  include  the termination  date  (i.e.,  if  not  used  by  X  date,  POA  expires).  If  a  new  allotment  is established,  all  of  the  current  requirements  to  start  an  allotment  must  be  met  (see Chapter 57 for allotment start requirements).  A General POA is not acceptable to establish, change, or stop an allotment. 2.4.2.  Source  Documents.  DJMS  requires  source  documents  for  all  transactions  to  support changes to the MMPA.  Figure 2.1 contains general requirements applicable to military pay orders. 2.4.2.1.  Types: in 2.4.2.1.1.  Regular  Source  Documents. entitlement  and  deductions  on  the  MMPA.    The  various  chapters  describe  the preparation of supporting documents to be used for each specific DJMS entitlement, deduction,  and  miscellaneous  MMPA  data  input.    Payment  and  collection vouchers  submitted to DFAS-RSAB/DE  support the DJMS payment and collection input.   Authorize  and  support  changes 2.4.2.1.2.  Miscellaneous  Source  Documents.    Authorize  changes  to  the  MMPA which do not involve entitlements and deductions, such as payment options. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 63  2.4.2.1.3.  Military  Leave  Documents.  Used  only  in  the  leave  accounting  system. Instructions on the use of military leave documents are in Chapter 44. 2.4.2.1.4.  Telegram and Telephone.  When the servicing FSO is at a different location from  the  unit,  DJMS  data  may  be  received  by  telegram  or  telephone.    Message should  cite  document  number,  name,  and  SSN  of  member,  effective  date  and description  of  change,  and  any  other  data  necessary  to  support  the  change  in  a member's  pay.   A  confirming certified  source document with the same number must be submitted immediately.  On receipt of confirming source document, verify data on document  with  that  in  message  and  attach  copy  of  message  to  confirming  source document.   Messages must also  be  numbered  sequentially  for  control  of receipt. 2.4.2.1.5.  Facsimile  (FAX)  receipt  of  source  documents.   Members  not  physically located  within  close  proximity  of  their  servicing  FSO  may  FAX  certain  source documents to the servicing FSO for processing changes to their pay accounts.  These documents  will  be  submitted  to  DFAS-DE  with  the  FSO's  regular  quarterly submission (Records Center Handbook available on FTP site for reference) of source documents. 2.4.2.1.5.1.  Authority  to  accept,  via  FAX  from  members,  is  limited  to  source documents necessary to support: 2.4.2.1.5.1.1.  Address changes; 2.4.2.1.5.1.2.  Financial organization account changes; 2.4.2.1.5.1.3.  Allotment starts, stops, or changes; 2.4.2.1.5.1.4.  Leave requests; and 2.4.2.1.5.1.5.  Withholding changes (TD Forms W-4). 2.4.2.1.5.2.  Source documents supporting any  pay-affecting transactions  may  be accepted via FAX,  with review and  signature of  either the member's commander or  the  comptroller/  budget  officer  at  the  member's  duty  location.  Examples include, but are not limited to: 2.4.2.1.5.2.1.  AF Form 220 2.4.2.1.5.2.2.  AF Form 594 2.4.2.1.5.2.3.  DD Form 2367 2.4.2.2.  Forms Used.   DJMS input transactions are documented on  forms suited for the transaction and keyed into the computer.  These are: 2.4.2.2.1.  AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization. 2.4.2.2.2.  DD Form 2558, Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change an Allotment. 2.4.2.2.3.  DD  Form  2559,  Savings  Bond  Allotment  Authorization/Active  Duty  or Retired Pay. 2.4.2.2.4.  SBD-2104,  Authorization  for  purchase  and  request  for  change  United States Series EE Savings Bonds. 64 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.4.2.2.5.  Various source documents prescribed in this volume. 2.4.2.3.  Number of Copies: 2.4.2.3.1.  Initiated  in  FSO.    Prepare  original  and  one  copy.    (Note:    SBD-2104  is available in only one original copy front and back.  The is the DFAS-DE copy, not an FSO retained copy.) 2.4.2.3.2.  Units  or  Base  Activities.    FSO  receives  original  and  one  copy  of  source documents originated by units or base activities other than the FSO.  (Exception:  FSO receives  only  original  of  SBD-2104  source  document.    This  is  the  DFAS-DE  copy, not a copy to be retained by the FSO.) 2.4.2.3.3.  Leave Transactions.  See Chapter 44. 2.4.2.4.  Filing  of  Source  Documents.  Each  source  of  input  keeps  a  suspense  copy  of every source document.   Keep this copy in suspense until acknowledged by an entry on the daily register of tra nsa ctions  (DROT),  or  J UMPS  Data  C ollection  Docu ment Transmittal  List  (DTL),  (UH099CAO3).    Each  input  source  ensures  there  is  a properly  certified  document in  suspense  for  each transaction appearing on the DROT or DTL.  Notify the FSO of any transaction appearing on the DROT or DTL for which you do  not  have  proper  documentation.  Follow  up  to  determine  processing  status  of  any source documents in suspense which have not been acknowledged within 5 workdays by an  entry  on  the  DROT  or  DTL.  Attach  suspense  source  documents  to  the  applicable DROT or DTL and keep per Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. 2.4.3.  Certifications.   Certification  establishes that the  facts  stated in  supporting documents are  correct.   A  certifying  officer  attests  from  personal  knowledge  of  the  facts  acquired  in performance of duty. 2.4.3.1.  Pay-Affecting Documents.  Chief, Customer  Service,  will be  primary certifying official,  with  authority  to  delegate  the  certification  responsibilities  to  subordinates as appropriate to accommodate local circumstances.  Certification is required on original document only.  When an MPO consists of more then one page, sign each original page. 2.4.3.2.  Certification  as  True  Copies.  An  FSO  cannot  certify  any  documents  as  true copies unless they pertain to his or her own personal account. 2.4.3.3.  Signature  Cards.   DD  Form  577,  Appointment/Termination  Record  – Authorized  Signature,  or  appointment  letters  are  maintained  at  each  input  source for  each  certifying  officer appointed  under  DoDFMR,  Volume  5,  chapter  33;  also  see DoDFMR Volume 5, for certification of documents within the FSO. 2.4.4.  Input  Source  Codes.  Two  alphanumeric  characters  assigned  to  each  activity authorized to prepare and submit DJMS documentation.  This code identifies source of input to the system and prints on the DROT or DTL.  The input source code should be annotated in  the  upper  right  hand  corner  of  the  AF  Form  1373,  MPO  Document  Control   Log - Transmittal  (Figure 2.4),  transmittal  number block and in the upper right hand corner of  each  source  document  transmitted.    FSO  retains  AF  Form  1373  per  Air  Force  Records Disposition Schedule.  (See Figure 2.2 for FSO source input table.) AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 65  2.4.5.  Processing  Documentation,  which  originated  outside  the  FSO,  within  Customer Support.  Customer  Support  receives  two  copies  of  category  III  documents,  except  leave forms  and  MPF-originated  AF  Forms  2098,  Duty  Status  Change,  on  AF  Form  1373  (Figure 2.4).   Number  the  AF  Forms 1373 sequentially by  the input  source.   Renumbering of AF Forms 1373 at the beginning of fiscal years is based on FSO  discretion.  FSO retains AF Form 1373 per Air Force Records Disposition Schedule. Document flow within the FSO is: 2.4.5.1.  Within the FSO.  Sends originated category III documents to Customer Support for processing. 2.4.5.2.  Processing  Unit.    Prepares  DJMS-AC  input  by  encoding  the  data  into  the computer. Transcribes transaction  numbers assigned  by JUMPS Data Collection (JDC), or  Defense  Military  Pay  Office  (DMO),  to  source  documents.    Sends  documents  for review. 2.4.5.3.  Review: 2.4.5.3.1.  Obtains  Quality  Assurance  Batch  Print  (UH099CA46)  and  verifies  data input to the computer against  source  document.    Verifies transactions against  source documents.  Corrects or deletes transactions as necessary. 2.4.5.3.2.  Returns  documents  found  to  be  incomplete  or  incorrect  to  input  source.  Uses  AF  Form 48, Source Document Reject Control Slip, to control rejected source documents.    Other  locally developed  forms  may be used instead  of  AF Form 48,  or reject card in 2.4.5.3.3 below. 2.4.5.3.3.  Prepares  optional  FSO  document  reject  card  concurrently  with  rejection of  source  documents  to  input  source.  Deletes  transactions,  input  to  DJMS-AC,  that relate to the rejected  source documents.  Rejected document transactions appear, and are controlled on, the DROT. 2.4.5.3.4.  Returns  source  documents  to  processing  for  preparation  of  DJMS-AC update. 2.4.5.4.  Control Area within Customer Support. 2.4.5.4.1.  Attaches  original  source  document  to  original  DTL  (UH099CAO3).  Places  documents  in  same  sequence as  shown  on the left-hand  side  of the DTL and holds  for  quarterly  submission  to  the  Defense  Federal  Records  Center  (DFRC).  Keeping documents in input source sequence through processing helps in aligning to the appropriate DTL. 2.4.5.4.2.  Keeps  duplicate copy of  source documents  with the duplicate  copy  of the DTL.    To  avoid  unnecessary  reproduction,  it  is  not  necessary  to  make  copies  of source  documents,  that  may  be  kept  in  other  areas,  solely  for  the  purpose  of  filing them  with  the  duplicate  copy  of  the DTL  (for  example, travel  vouchers).   However, these documents must be available within the FSO  for  research  or  to  help  recreate the  quarterly document submission package if  that becomes necessary. 2.4.5.4.3.  Maintains  Copy  of  Disbursement  and  Collection  Vouchers.    This fulfills both MAFR and DJMS documentation requirements. 66 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.4.5.4.4.  Maintains Copies  of all DJMS Generated Reports.   With  the  exception  of the  DTL  and  one-time  pay  authorizations,  all  reports  may  be  maintained  on  a  hard drive or floppy disk. Reports  that require action  will  be printed  first  for the  purpose of  research.    Information  can later  be  added  to  the  disk  to  show  action  taken.   All reports,  either  paper  or  disk,  are  maintained  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Records Disposition Schedule. 2.4.6.  Submission of Source Documents to the DFRC. 2.4.6.1.  Submit  source  documents  on  a  DFAS-DE  processing  month  basis  (original unless  otherwise  specified  in  other  chapters)  to  the  DFRC  by  the  15th  of  the  month following  the  end  of  the  quarter  (Records  Center  Handbook  available  on  FTP  site  for reference). 2.4.6.1.1.  Documents  Supporting  DTL  Entries. supporting every entry on the DTL for the current day's processing cycle number.   Send  source  documents 2.4.6.1.2.  Rejected and Recycled Advance Transactions. 2.4.6.1.2.1.  If  a  transaction  recycled  and  rejected  to  the  input  source,  use  the original document attached to the DTL.  This document must be pulled and lined-off the original DTL and reprocessed, if required, with a new transaction number.  Delete the prior transaction number  on the  document.   If  original  document  has been  submitted  to  DFAS-DE,  use  a  copy  of  the  FSO  retained  copy  as  the supporting document.   Annotate the  document  with the  new transaction  number, retain  original  cycle  and  transaction  number  as  a  reference  to  the  original document. 2.4.6.1.2.2.  If a transaction rejected to DFAS-DE and set up a Case Management System (CMS) case,  do  not  pull  the  document  or  line  it  off  the  DTL.    Instead, submit  the  document  as  if  it  had  processed,  annotating  the  DTL  accordingly.  Advise  DFAS-JM/DE  (the  office  working  the  CMS  case)  of the  DTL transmission and cycle number and date. 2.4.6.1.2.3.  If a transaction cannot be input at your location (i.e., member in `V' status,  etc.)  and  you  request  that  DFAS-JM/DE  do  the  necessary  processing, include  the  source document  with  your next document  submission to DFAS-DE, manually entering the document on the next DTL as if you were the input source.  Include the transmission and cycle  numbers and the  date  from this DTL  in  your request to DFAS-DE, whether ECCS or hardcopy correspondence.  DFAS-JM/DE will  not  process  the  transaction  without  this  information.    Instead,  they  will send  you  a  message  advising  that  the  transaction  cannot  be  processed  until you provide the required information. 2.4.6.2.  How  to  Submit.    Use  AF  Form  1209,  Document  Transmittal  (JUMPS)  (Figure 2.5) to transmit DTLs  with attached  supporting  documents  for  each  processing month's  business  to  the DFRC.    Submit  AF  Form  2070  (Figure  2.3),  with  documents when required.  (See paragraph 1.2). 2.4.6.2.1.  Preparation.   Prepare  AF Form 1209 in triplicate.   Complete all  heading blocks. Using the document data section show: AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 67  2.4.6.2.1.1.  Each  cycle  and transmission numbers which were used for mid month (MM) or end of month (EOM) payrolls. transmission  number.   Identify 2.4.6.2.1.2.  Total cycles must be in DTL and cycle sequence.  All cycle numbers must  be  annotated  on  AF  Form  1209  in  numerical  and  alpha  sequence.  (See Figure 2.5). 2.4.6.2.1.3.  Number of box or package containing the documents. 2.4.6.2.1.4.  Total number of transactions requiring source documents. 2.4.6.2.1.5.  Total number of boxes of packages. 2.4.6.2.1.6.  Certification  at  bottom  of  section:    I  certify  that  the  above  cycles were  transmitted  to  DFAS-DE  and  are  supported  by  required  source  documents in this shipment for the month of (month) (year) - DSN #. 2.4.6.2.1.7.  Annotation  that  AF  Form  2070  is  attached  for  applicable  month's submissions. 2.4.6.2.2.  Signature.    FSO,  chief  of  Military  Pay,  chief  of  Pay  Service  and  Control or designated representative signs AF Form 1209. 2.4.6.2.3.  Packaging.  Package DTLs with documents attached by date.  Place original AF Form 2070 (when required) and original and copy of AF Form 1209 in package #1 of  supporting  documents.  When  sending  original  vouchers  or  DJMS  source documents, ensure all supporting documentation is affixed with staples.  Records must be  contained in  file  folders or accordion  pocket  folders.  File  folders cannot  be more than 1 inch thick.  Do not use shipping cartons that exceed 15" long, 12" wide and 10" deep (dimensions of Federal Supply Service item 8115-290- 3379) to send documents to  the  DFRC.  BOX  NUMBER  -  Box  Number,  month/calendar  year  of  documents; CONTENTS  -  Cycle(s)  of  documents.    Identify  cycle  range  (versus  individual cycles).    Ensure  DFAS-DE  1021  reflects  the  order  the  boxes  are  packed  in.    It  is critical the DFAS-DE 1021 is accurate as it is used to research DJMS substantiating document  requests.  Only  use  black  marker  to  prepare  box.    Record  the  following information on the front of the box: accession number – accession number provided by DFAS-IN  (upper  left-hand  corner),  agency  box  number  (applicable  box  number  i.e., box 1 of 2, upper right-hand corner).  Do not include any additional information on the front of the box.  Do not tape or write over the accession number or agency box number as the DFRC will not accept it that way.   Do not forward boxes without an accession number.  Accession numbers are only valid for 90 days so it is imperative  boxes are forwarded  to  DFRC  ASAP  after  receipt  of  accession  number.    Contact  DFAS-IN Records Manager if you encounter a problem forwarding boxes to DFRC within the 90  day  period.    Prior  to  sealing  boxes  ensure  contents  of  each  box  are  facing  the “front”  of  the  box.    Boxes  should  be  at  least  ¾  full,  if  possible.    Crumpled  paper, computer  paper  (no  printed  information),  brown  wrapping  paper,  cardboard,  etc., should  be  used  as  filler.    Do  not  use  plastic  bubble  wrap  or  anything  that  could  be mistaken  for  records  as  filler.    Box  1  should  contain  a  copy  of  the  SF  135  and applicable  detail list on  top  of the  folders  or in the  front  of  the  first  folder.  Include processing month and year for which submitted, ADSN/ISI, serial number of package 68 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 (for  example,  "1  of  3")  and  DJMS  Supporting  Documents  on  each  package.  Keep duplicate  AF  Form  1209  per  Air  Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule.  Source documents  must  be  fastened  to  the  appropriate  DTL  securely  enough  to  withstand handling during  shipping.  Paper  clips or rubber  bands,  whichever are  most practical, should be used.  Do not use staples to fasten documents. 2.4.6.2.4.  Address.    National  Archives-Rocky  Mountain  Region,  Bldg  48,  Denver Federal Records Center (DFRC), P.O. Box 25307, Denver CO 80225. 2.4.6.2.5.  Mailing.  White  ‘storage’  boxes  are  not  shipping  boxes.  It  is  advisable  to pursue shipping methods other than registered  mail when using ‘storage’  boxes since sending registered is  costly and destroys the ‘storage box’.  If registered mail is used, the  boxes  must  be  packaged  so  that  markings,  tape,  labels  and/or  stamps  do  not compromise  the  box.  The  DFRC  will  not  rebox  files  when  the  ‘storage  box’  is compromised.  All records received, that are not in compliance will be returned at the expense of the originating office.   By the 15th  of the month  following the  end  of the quarter (Jan  – Mar,  Apr – Jun, Jul  – Sep, Oct  - Dec),  submit SF 135 and  applicable detail list to DFAS-IN Records Management, DFAS-JBDM/IN.  Retain a copy of all SF  135s  and  detail  lists  submitted.    Upon  receipt  of  the  SF  135  copy  with  the accession number, replace the copy awaiting an accession number.  SF 135 retention is six (6) years after cutoff, i.e., end of year applicable records were destroyed.  Bases that  have  not  cut  over  to  AFFSC  are  still  required  to  send  documents  to  DFRC quarterly.    Bases  that  have  cutover  do  not  submit  hardcopy  documents  (other  than those  which  do  not  require  DJMS  processing)  because  EIM  is  the  document repository for all source documents that substantiate DJMS processing.  Select one of the following methods for submitting SF 135 and applicable detail list: 2.4.6.2.5.1.  Email Email attachments must be sent in PDF format. irene.lewis@dfas.mil  or  dale.wentling@dfas.mil  Note:        2.4.6.2.5.2.  Fax Commercial 317-510-1120, DSN 699-1120          2.4.6.2.5.3.  Mail   DFAS-JBDM/IN 8899 E 56th  St Indianapolis IN   46249-6540  2.4.6.2.6.  Corrected  Documents.    Use  original  and  copy  of  AF  Form  1209  to submit  documents that  correct  previously  submitted  source  documents that have  not rejected.  If  packaged  in  white  ‘storage’  box,  see  mailing  instructions  in  2.4.6.2.5 above.    Forward  these  submissions  as  generated  and  identify  them  to  the  original DTL for filing.  Send by registered mail to the DFRC. 2.4.6.2.7.  Request  for  Source  Documents.  Copies  of  DJMS  MMPA  histories  are available  online  from  1982  to  current.  LESs  are  available  from  October  1992  to current.  Reference Chapters 5 and 7 of this manual for further information on access to  these  documents.  All  other  requests  for  hard  copies  of  source  documents  and MMPA histories or LESs prior to above dates should be sent to DFAS-IN.  All requests to  retrieve  records  must  be in  writing  and  submitted  via  fax,  email  at  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 69  CIN-RECMgt@dfas.mil, or  mailed as indicated  below, and include  the  month and year  of  the  document,  date,  accession  number,  and/or  box  number  if  known,  in addition to information below.  Records are normally forwarded within two weeks of receipt of request.  FAX to  Commercial  317-510-1120,  DSN  699-1120.    Email  can also be sent to  irene.lewis@dfas.mil or dale.wentling@dfas.mil.  Hardcopy mail to DFAS-JBDM/IN,  8899  E  56th  St,  Indianapolis  IN  46249-6540.  Since  most documents contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII), e.g., name, SSN, phone number, etc., care must be taken to protect this information.  If the request is sent via email, ensure it is encrypted and includes your digital signature so it can be added to the DFAS-IN Records Management contact list. 2.4.6.2.7.1.  Member's SSN. 2.4.6.2.7.2.  Member's full name. 2.4.6.2.7.3.  Input ADSN/ISI. 2.4.6.2.7.4.  Cycle number. 2.4.6.2.7.5.  Transaction number. 2.4.6.2.7.6.

Name  and  DSN  phone  number  of  person  requesting  the  source document.  When  inquiring  about  DJMS  documents,  DFAS-IN  will  need  the ADSN,  cycle  and  the  quarter  or  month/year  of  the  documents.    When  DJMS documents are  first  submitted, the SF 135 that is  included  with the documents is sent back to the base with an accession number.  That accession number, which is on the returned SF 135, is required for the retrieval. 2.4.7.  Processing DD Forms 139: 2.4.7.1.  Preparation.    Details  are  in  Figure  2.6.  Figure  2.8  contains  an  example  of  a completed DD Form 139. 2.4.7.2.  Initiating FSO Responsibilities.  Details are in Figure 2.7. 2.4.7.3.  Receiving FSO Responsibilities.

JPPSO issues  pay adjustment authorizations for incurring costs relating to excess shipments of household goods and trailers.  Detailed processing instructions are in Chapter 69. 2.4.9.  Support Files, Records and Logs: 2.4.9.1.  Purpose.  Servicing FSO maintains these files as references. 2.4.9.2.  Location.    Pay  Service  and  Control,  under  the  supervisor  of  the  chief  of Military  Pay,  maintains  these  files  in  a  convenient  location  in  the  military  pay  area.  These files may be maintained in any sequence that suits local needs. 70 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.4.10.  Management  Files.    A  management  file  must  be  established  to  maintain  the following documentation: 2.4.10.1.  Entitlement Re-certification.

Consist  of  all  computer  products.   Maintained as  specified in Air Force Records Disposition Schedule or as specified in other chapters in this manual. 2.5.  Analyzing  the  MMPA.  In  order  to  research  an  inquiry  or  pay  problem,  the  MMPA must  be  analyzed,  using  all  available  information,  both  internal  and  external.    A  proper analysis of the MMPA requires the DJMS data elements and codes book, the member's MMPA printout,  applicable  DTRs,  and  applicable  LES  history.    The  pay-determining  factors  from  the MMPA which must be considered are: 2.5.1.  MMPA processing date. 2.5.2.  Mid-month cutoff date. 2.5.3.  Individual  closure  process  codes  (see  Attachment  12)  for  all  pay  items  that  have been  closed in  the  current  processing  month.   Account  for  all  items  posted  in payment  and pay computation and collection areas of the account, open and closed entries, for the current processing month. 2.5.4.  Other factors which are needed include: 2.5.4.1.  Member's grade. 2.5.4.2.  Member's pay option. 2.5.4.3.  Member's status. 2.5.4.4.  Number of FITW exemptions 2.5.4.5.  FITW election (marital status). 2.5.4.6.  Open-status entry - number. 2.5.4.7.  Member's conversion date. 2.5.4.8.  Time frame for which the pay computation is required. 2.5.4.9.  Member's date of separation. 2.6.  MMPA  Format.  The MMPA is  organized  by  category of  entry.  All  entries are  identified by  a  FORMAT  ID  which  is  made  up  of  two  digits;  the  first  digit  identifies  the  category  (A--allotments,  B--leave,  numeric--entitlements,  etc.);  the  second  digit  identifies  the  entry (AB--bond allotment, BR--leave balance, 01 basic pay).  See Attachment 18 for a complete list of FORMAT IDs and categories.  Entries can be classified as fixed, open, current month, closed, and  history.   In  addition,  the  MMPA  has  future  and  suspense entries, LES remarks, and cross-references.  The groups and categories of data in the MMPA are discussed below. 2.6.1.  Data Item.  This is the smallest identifiable piece of information in the MMPA.  On an MMPA  printout  or  terminal  screen,  this  shows  up  as  a  data  name  followed  by  code,  date, amount, etc.  Example, SEX M, START 840703, ENTLMT-MM 432.28. 72 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.6.2.  Entry.  MMPA  entries  are  identified  by  FORMAT  ID  and  contain  one  or  more  data item(s).  An  entry  contains  enough  data  to  allow  the  computer  to  perform  some  specific operation(s), allow an individual to read the MMPA and determine why the computer acted as it did, and what it will do if new data is added.  Entries can be described as follows: 2.6.2.1.  Fixed.  These entries are present in all MMPAs whether they contain data or not.  Thus a printout may show entries with all zeros or data name(s) followed by a blank.  The fixed  area  was  designed  to  facilitate  data  processing.    An  entry  open  data  field  will identify when an entry was created or when the latest change to a MMPA entry occurred. 2.6.2.2.  Open  Entries.    These  are  entries  that  are  currently  in  effect.    They  usually contain  a  start  or  effective  date,  code  to  identify  information  and  entitlement  or deduction  amount  field(s)  if  a  monetary  entry.  An  entry  open  data  field  will  identify when an entry was created or when the latest change to an MMPA entry occurred. 2.6.2.3.  Current Month  Closed and History  Entries.  These  entries have an  entry  closed data  field  to  identify  the  processing  date,  update  number,  processing  month  and  mid month/end  of  month flag  for the transaction that caused the entry to close and usually a stop  date  to  show  the  last  day  this  entry  was  in  effect.    History  entries  differ  from current  month closed entries only by money amounts.  The  current  month closed entries with  amount  fields  affect  pay  for  the  current  month;  thus,  they  contain  the  same amount  fields as  open  entries.   Month-end  processing removes  the amount  fields  from the  current  month-closed  entries.    Most  history  entries  are  deleted  from  the  MMPA after 12 months by month-end processing, based on the entry closed data fields. 2.6.2.4.  Future and Suspense Entries.  These entries appear at the end of a printout.  They have the  same  FORMAT  ID(s)  as  the  entries  to  which  they  pertain.    Future  entries  are used  to  establish  a  suspense  for  the  computer  to  generate  transactions  to  update  the MMPA.  Suspense  entries,  on  the  other  hand,  generate  transactions  that  reject  or management notices to notify people of manual actions that are required.  The codes in these entries determine the action taken and the effective date the action will be taken. 2.6.3.  LES Remarks:  The LES remarks group appears on an MMPA print after the suspense entries. LES remarks are generated whenever an action processes which changes the MMPA.  These remarks identify  what the action  was and  when it  processed.  These LES remarks  on the MMPA are used to produce the remarks that are printed on the LES itself at the end of the month  and  are  deleted  from  the  MMPA  by  month-end  restructure.    The  remark  entry consists  of  13  characters  of  data,  usually  constructed  as  follows:  An  LES  remarks  action code,  an  LES  remarks  format  code,  an  effective  date  and  the  Julian  date  on  which  the transaction  processed.    The  LES  remarks  conserve  computer  storage  by  identifying  a meaningful  phrase  in a  computer  lookup  table.   When the  LES remark requires  more than 13 characters, a  second  entry is created.   It contains an LES remarks action code of 99, the same LES remarks format code as the first entry and up to nine characters of variable data. 2.6.4.  Cross-Reference.  The cross-references are the last group printed on an MMPA print.  When a transaction processes  with an  effective  date  before  current month,  a cross-reference is  made  to  each  month  of  history  that  is  adjusted.    There  may  or  may  not  be  data  in  the cross-reference group.  Each cross-reference contains the year and month of the retroactive transaction  corrected  and  month  in  which  the  transaction  processed.  A  separate  entry  is made for each month affected by processing of a retroactive transaction.   During month-end AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 73  restructure,  all  cross-references  that  pertain  to  a  period  before  immediate  access  storage (IAS) history are written to tape and the comparable entry is deleted from the MMPA. 2.7.  AUTODIN: 2.7.1.  Use  of  AUTODIN.    AUTODIN  is  used  to  transmit  data  between  DFAS-DE  and  the personnel community  or  JPPSO.   Transactions  processed  through  these  base-level  systems are  transmitted  to  DFAS-DE  via  AUTODIN  and  DFAS-DE  acknowledges  receipt  of  these transmissions via an XT03 (AUTODIN Acknowledgment Message), which appears as: 2.7.2.  DJMS  AUTODIN  Message  Log  List  +  PGM.   This  is  a  separate  log  accessed  via CICSJ3  (JAUO).    This  log  is  made  available  daily.    To  obtain  missing  transmissions  of incoming AUTODIN, the MPF advises base communications to request a re-transmission. 2.7.3.  Management Notices.  Refer to Attachment 22 for all management notices.  2.8.  DTR: 2.8.1.  Frequency.    DFAS-DE  produces  DTRs  once  a  day  (with  certain  exceptions  noted below) to include all transactions processed in the preceding 24 hours.  For any FSO, a DTR includes  all  transactions  in  one  or  more  transmission  by  the  FSO  or  MPF,  but  not necessarily all transmissions by the base on a single day.   For example, DTR for 10 August (processing  date)  may  include  second  transmission  made  by  FSO  on  9  August,  the  first transmission made by the MPF on 10 August, and the first transmission  made  by  the  FSO on 10  August.    It  may  include  transactions  transmitted  earlier  and  being  processed  again.  Exceptions: 2.8.1.1.  No  input.    If  there  were  no  transactions  in  any  of  the  eight  sections  listed  in paragraph  2.8.3  below  for  any  member  serviced  by  the  FSO,  no  DTR  is  sent  to  that FSO. 2.8.1.2.  Month-End  Restructure.    No  transactions  are  processed  and  no  DTRs  are produced. 2.8.2.  Receipt  and  Control.   QE  technicians  receive  a  copy  of  the  DTR  and  control  action items to ensure that all required processing is completed. 2.8.3.  Sections,  Content  and  Sequence.  The  DTR  contains  eight  sections,  with  category  I (MPF) and category III (FSO) transactions usually segregated. 2.8.3.1.  Sections: 2.8.3.1.1.  Section 1 - Uncleared rejects. 74 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.8.3.1.2.  Section 2 - Uncleared suspense items. 2.8.3.1.3.  Section 3 - Rejected transactions. 2.8.3.1.4.  Section 4 - Processed transactions. 2.8.3.1.5.  Section 5 - Partially processed transactions. 2.8.3.1.6.  Section 6 - Processed transactions originated by others. 2.8.3.1.7.  Section 7 - Advance transactions. 2.8.3.1.8.  Section 8 - Recycled transactions. 2.8.3.1.9.  Transactions in SSN sequence. 2.8.3.2.  Content.    The  first  entry  for  each  transaction  in  all  sections  identifies transaction  and/or  member  affected.    This  entry  usually  includes  trailer  card  indicator, SSN, name (first five of last name), format ID, action indicator and variable data.  It also includes transaction control identification which consists of source of input, transmission number  and  transaction  number  (sequence).  Where  appropriate,  the  first  entry  for  each transaction is followed by other information on as many lines as needed. 2.8.3.3.  Sequence.  Entries  within  each  section  are  normally  in  SSN  sequence  within transmission number within FSO/MPF identifier. 2.8.4.  Section 1 - Uncleared Rejects:   Contents  of  ERR-RECORD  are  data  described 2.8.4.1.  Content.    This  is  a  record  of  error  card  (ERR-CARD)  images  created  for transactions  which  previously  failed  edits  at  DFAS-DE  and  were  returned  to  the  base for  correction  but  have  not  been  corrected.    Transactions  to  which  error  cards apply  do  not  appear. in  paragraph 2.8.3.2 above, with error codes in the variable data areas.   Also, this section contains  date  original  transaction  was  rejected  (P-DATE)  and  next  follow-up  date  (F-DATE).    If  the  original  transaction  was  input  by  an  MPF,  notice  appears  on  the servicing FSO DTR, except if there was an error in identifying data making it impossible to access the MMPA, or, if member is in a PCS status and an arrival transaction has not been received  from  the  gaining  station,  entry  appears  only  on  MPF  DTR.   In  all  other cases,  notice appears  on  the input  source  or  DFAS-DE  DTR  only,  depending  on  which activity received the original rejected transaction for correction. 2.8.4.2.  Follow-up.    An  uncleared  reject  appears  on  the  DTR  of  the  input  source FSO/MPF one time.  A manual control of rejects must be established to control uncleared rejects. 2.8.4.3.  Action.    For  each  item  in  this  section,  QE  determines  why  the  DFAS-DE suspenses  have  not  been  cleared  and  what  control  actions  are  needed  to  clear  reject suspenses.    This  usually  involves  correction  and  re-submission  or  cancellation  of transaction  and  return  of  ERR-RECORD  to  DFAS-DE  which  clears  DFAS-DE  reject suspense. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 75  2.8.5.  Section 2 - Uncleared Suspense Items: 2.8.5.1.  Content.    This  section  contains  miscellaneous  suspense  notices  requiring  FSO action  or submission of transactions before actions can be completed by the central site.  If  DFAS-DE  does  not  receive  required  information  or  transactions,  follow-up  notice appears in this section.  Examples of suspense transactions are: 2.8.5.1.1.  Date DFAS-DE must receive PCS arrival message; 2.8.5.1.2.  Differences  between  DFAS-DE  MMPA  files  and  AFPC  files  detected  on conversion  and  on  comparison  of  accession,  separation  and  change-of-grade transactions; 2.8.5.1.3.  Unsettled  accounts  receivable  -  debt  has  been  established,  but  repayment schedule has not been received; 2.8.5.1.4.  Difference between payments authorized and payments made. 2.8.5.2.  Follow-up.    Suspense  items  appear  on  servicing  FSO  DTR  as  required information becomes needed or before that date.   If required information or transaction is  not  received,  follow-up  appears  in  this  section.    Depending  on  type  and  nature  of suspense,  follow-up  may  be  at  7-day  intervals,  entitlement  held  in  abeyance  may  be stopped or DFAS-DE may contact the base to find out why action has not been taken. 2.8.5.3.  Action.    QE  determines  action  required  for  each  item  and  controls  action  to completion.  This  usually  involves  preparation  and  submission,  to  DFAS-DE,  of  a transaction  or  a  document called  for by the suspense  notice.   Technicians  request MPFs prepare and submit documents when source of input is MPF. 2.8.6.  Section 3 - Rejected Transactions: 2.8.6.1.  Content.    This  section  contains  transactions  from  current  central  processing which  could  not  be  recorded  because  of  error  or  incompatibility  in  MMPA.  It  also includes critical transactions with invalid  or  missing  non-critical  data  which  have  been recorded  in  part  in  the  MMPA  (for  example,  a  casual  payment  for  which  the  voucher number is missing).  Error code explains which part of the transaction requires correction. When  data  in  MMPA is inconsistent  with  data  in transaction,  this  section  also  contains extracts of data in the MMPA. 2.8.6.2.  Format.   For  each rejected transaction, the  ERR-RECORD image appears  first.  It contains all identifying data, error  codes explaining why transaction was rejected, and data extracted from MMPA showing difference between MMPA and transaction.  Trailer record  indicator  field  shows  Z  for  totally  rejected    transactions  and  Y  for  those transactions  recorded  in  part.  ERR-RECORD  image  is  followed  by  contents  of transaction card(s).  For multiple-record transactions, data common to all records (record positions 2-19 and 68-80) appear only once, followed by variable data  from  each record in sequence.  Each record is identified by applicable trailer record indicator.  Extracts of MMPA data, for transactions rejected because of inconsistency, follow the variable data. 76 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 2.8.6.3.  Location.    Rejected  and  partially  rejected  FSO  transactions  appear  on  the DTR  of  the originating FSO.  Rejected or partially rejected MPF transactions appear on the DTR of the servicing FSO.  If an MPF transaction contains errors in identifying data, making  it  impossible  to  access  the  MMPA  and  obtain  the  servicing  ADSN,  the  reject appears only on the MPF abbreviated DTR. 2.8.6.4.  Rejects  to  DFAS-DE.    Certain  transactions  are  programmed  to  reject  to  DFAS-DE for manual intervention (i.e., entitlements retroactive to a period outside IAS).  Such transactions are not rejected to the base.  They appear in this section of the DTR with an error code which indicates that no action is required by input source. 2.8.7.  Section 4 - Processed Transactions: 2.8.7.1.  Content.  This section contains FSO transactions which passed all edits or which could  be  made  valid  by  computer-supplied  codes  and  were  used  to  update  MMPAs.  It includes transactions from  current  transmission,  matured advance  transactions received in  prior  months  and  transactions  that  were  awaiting  the  receipt  of  additional  data.  Most  advance  transactions  from  prior months  which  are  effective  in  current  month  are processed  in  the  first  current  month  update  and appear  on the  first DTR  for  the month.  Recycled  transactions  appear  until  transactions  that  must  precede  them  have  been received  and  processed,  thus  permitting  recycled  transactions  to  process.  If the  missing transactions  have  not  been  received  after  the  prescribed  recycle  period,  the  recycled transactions  are  rejected  to  the  originator  or  the  operating  directorate.  Normally  only transactions input by the servicing FSO are included, but when MPF input transactions are processed with supplied codes (see (3) below) they also appear in this section. 2.8.7.2.  Format.  First entry contains the contents of the first record of the transaction as submitted,  except  when  computer-supplied  codes  have  been  substituted  or  inserted as  described  in  2.8.7.3  below.  If  a  multiple-record  transaction  is  processed  without supplied codes, only the first record is printed to identify the transaction. 2.8.7.3.  Supplied  Codes.   If  certain  data is  missing or invalid in  essential  transactions such as accessions, DJMS  supplies a  valid  code to enable an account to  be  established or  updated.    For  example,  if  in  an  accession  transaction,  the  member's  sex  code  is missing  or  invalid,  the  code  for  male  is  supplied.    An  ERR-RECORD  image  is  printed as  first  entry  for  transaction  with  an  error  code  identifying  the  supplied  code.    This  is followed by  the  first record  of  the  transaction, and if the  supplied  code  applies  to  other than  first  record  of  a  multiple-record  transaction,  the  changed  content  of  the  record  in which the code was supplied.  For example, missing data is supplied in the third record of a  four-record  transaction.  ERR-RECORD  image,  and  first  and  third  record  images,  are printed. 2.8.7.4.  Action.  QE reviews transactions in this section with specific attention to those showing supplied  codes. In  some  cases,  supplied  codes  will  have  been  substituted  to  conform  to  legal requirements  (for  example,  number  of  years  service  for  severance  pay  reduced  to  conform  to maximum  upon  which  computation  may  be  made).   Where this  occurs,  no  further  correction  is necessary  or  permitted.    In  other  instances,  if  the  supplied  code  is  not  correct,  QE  prepares a  new transaction  immediately to correct  the  erroneous data.  Method  of correction  is  the  same   AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 77  as  prescribed  in  e  ach  of  the  applicable  sections,  parts  three  through  seven,  except that  no ERR-RECORD is returned.  Other transactions in this section are spot-checked to ensure they processed as intended. 2.8.8.  Section 5 - Partially Processed Transactions: 2.8.8.1.  Content.    This  section  lists  transactions  which  failed  edits  of  non-critical  data and  were  recorded  in  part  on  MMPAs  and  also  were  rejected  as  described  in subparagraph  2.8.6  above.  They  are  shown  in  the  same  manner  as  transactions  in section  4.    When  required  correction  is  received  and  processed,  the  correction transaction  is  shown  in  section  6.    Reject  entry  and  processed  portion  appear  on  the servicing FSO DTR. 2.8.8.2.  Action.  Items in this section are  primarily  for information purposes.  QE  makes sure that corrective action is taken.  Section 3 of the DTR reflects rejected transactions. 2.8.9.  Section 6 - Processed Transaction Originated by Others: 2.8.9.1.  Content.  This  section  lists  transactions,  applicable  to  members  serviced  by  the FSO,  that  were  input  by  other  than  that  FSO.  It  includes  fully  processed  MPF transactions,  transactions  such  as  accessions  and  promotions  input  by  AFPC,  address changes  from  allottees,  approved  claims adjudicated  by DFAS-DE,  casual payments  by other  FSOs,  and  transactions  generated  by  DJMS.  It  also  includes  transactions  which were originally generated  by the FSO  or the MPF  which  were rejected to  DFAS-DE  for manual  intervention,  and  then  reintroduced  in  modified  format  for  processing.  It includes  matured  advance  transactions  received  in  prior  month  from  other  than  the servicing  FSO  and  processed  recycle  transactions  which  were  input  by  other  than  the servicing  FSO. It does not include partially  processed transactions, regardless of  source. Transactions  in  this  section  may  include  computer-supplied  codes  as  described  in subparagraph 2.8.7.3 above.  Transactions are  shown  in the  same manner as those in section  4.   Transactions  are  shown  in  SSN  sequence regardless of input source.  MPF transactions are commingled. 2.8.9.2.  Action.  This  section  informs  the  FSO  of  actions  taken  by  other  activities affecting members'  services and is used to  respond to  member inquiries.   However, QE analyzes  any  supplied  code  transactions  to  determine  if  correction  transactions  are needed and to control the required corrections. 2.8.10.  Section 7 - Advance Transactions: 2.8.10.1.  Content.    This  section  shows  transactions  which  passed  edit  or  could  be validated, but which  did  not update MMPAs  because they  had a  future  month  effective date  or,  in  the  case  of  allotment  stops,  a  current  month  effective  date.  Allotment  is stopped after current month payment is  made  at  month  end.   Unless  computer-supplied codes  have  been  applied  as  described  in sub-paragraph  2.8.7.3 above, only content of the  first  record  of  the  transaction  is  printed.  If  a  supplied  code  has  been  applied,   ERR-RECORD  image  appears  as  the  first  entry,  followed  by  the  first  record  of  the transaction.    Contents  of  other  records  from  the  transaction  are  not  printed,  whether  or not supplied codes are applied.  Correction, if necessary, to supplied codes cannot be made until  the  transaction  has  been  processed  and  appears  in  section  4  or  6,  as  appropriate. Advance  transactions  are  not  partially  processed.  If  they  contain  erroneous  data  which 78 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 cannot be validated or  data is missing, they are rejected; these rejects must be corrected and entirely resubmitted by the input source. 2.8.10.2.  Action.  Transactions in this section are shown for information only. 2.8.11.  Section 8 - Recycled Transactions: section shows selected 2.8.11.1.  Content.  This transactions  which  passed  inter/intra-record  edits  and  validations  but  failed  consistency  edits  because  of  being processed  out  of  sequence.    After  a  transaction  passes  inter/intra-record  edits  and validation  but  fails to  pass  consistency  edits because of timing sequence, it is recycled against the MMPA.  DJMS programs determine whether additional data is required from the  input  source  of  the  transaction  or  from  a  prior  FSO,  and  assign  a  recycle  code  1  (input is required from prior FSO) or 2 (input is required from input source). Recycled transactions appear on the servicing FSO DTR except when a member is in a PCS status and an arrival transaction has not been received from the gaining station, they appear on the  MPF  DTR.    For  code  1  transactions,  DFAS-DE  contacts  the  prior  FSO  to  obtain departure  message. DTR shows whether additional input is required from the prior FSO or input source.  These transactions are rejected if required transactions are not received. 2.8.11.2.  Action: 2.8.11.2.1.  Transactions  Required  from  Input  Source.  If  the  transaction  is  one  for which  prior  transaction  is  expected  from  the  input  source  of  recycled  transaction (code  2),  QE  determines if required transaction  was previously  sent and rejected,  or was never sent.  If it was never sent, or  was  sent  and  rejected  but  never  resubmitted, the transaction is  sent immediately.  If it  has been submitted or has been resubmitted after being rejected, no action is required. 2.8.11.2.2.  Transaction  Required  from  Prior FSO.  If recycled  transaction  is  one  for which the transaction must be submitted by a prior FSO, no action is required. 2.8.12.  Transactions in SSN Sequence.  This section lists all transactions shown in Sections 1 through  8  in  SSN  sequence.    It  lists  the  section  of  the  DTR  where  the  transaction  was included and the action taken during update processing. 2.8.13.  Disposition.    After all action items on the DTR have been completed, QE sends the DTR  to  Pay  Service  and  Control  for  filing  and  to  be  available  for  research  and  use  in responding to member inquiries. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 79   Figure 2.1.

Description.  The JUMPS  Data  Collections (JDC)  subsystem  has  two  specially  designed applications  to  input  DJMS-AC  transactions  into  daily  updates.   They  are  the  JDC  Key  to Disk  Program  (JDC-III)  which  is  a  personal  computer  application  and  the  JUMPS  On-line Processing  System  (JOPS)  or  JDC  II.    Both  of  these  applications  are  supported  by microcomputers  consisting  of  a  central  processing unit  (CPU),  monitor,  keyboard  and  printer.  This equipment is located at base-level  financial services offices. 3.1.1.  JDC  III  is  used  to  key  DJMS-AC  transactions  for  later  file  transfer  to  the  central computer located at DFAS-DE.   Transactions are edited as  they are keyed in and  stored on either a floppy  disk or hard drive until they are transmitted to DFAS-DE.  Each FSO has the capability  to transmit  another  FSO's  transactions  or  receive  another  FSO's  output  products. When communications are down for an extended time, an FSO will create transactions on a floppy  diskette  and  send  the  floppy  diskette  to  a  nearby  location  (either  an  FSO  or  agent with  connectivity).    That  location  will  file  transfer  the  transactions  to  DFAS-DE  for inclusion  in  the  DJMS-AC  update.    Upon  completion  of  the  DJMS-AC  update  that location can request the output results for the FSO and send the floppy diskette to them for printing. 3.1.2.  JDC II is an on-line application that places transactions into a data storage area on the central  computer.   DFAS-DE  programs  provide  prompted  screen  formats  containing  edits for  most  of  the  DJMS-AC  input  transaction  formats.    Less  common  transaction  formats may  be  entered  on  a  single  generalized  format  screen.   Stored transactions can be accessed for display,  correction  or deletion by authorized  personnel.   A  supervisor  flag is required to indicate  the  transaction  file  has  been  verified.  Verified  transactions  are  automatically included in the next DJMS-AC update.  FSO transactions must be verified. 3.2.  Terms Explained: 3.2.1.  Cycle  is  a  series  of  alphanumeric  characters  sequentially  assigned  to  a  block  of transactions. The cycle is used as a tool for research purposes. 3.2.1.1.  FSO  Cycles.    LeaveWeb  uses  a  number/number  cycle  sequence  numbering system assigned by the user from 01 through 99 (repeating cycle 01 after termination of cycle  99).  For  all  cycles  done  manually  within  the  FSO  (not  LeaveWeb),  or  by geographically  separated  units  (GSU),  cycle  numbers  must  be  alpha/numeric (Example:  A0, A1, A2, B0, B1, etc). 3.2.1.2.  Agents  Cycles.    JDC  III  cycle  numbers  are  sequentially  assigned  by  the  user from  A1  through  Z9  and  are  repeated  after  termination  of  cycle  Z9.    NOTE:    Cycle numbers X1 through X9 are not to be used. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 93  3.2.1.3.  JDC  II  Cycles.    Cycle  numbers  are  systematically  assigned  on  each  terminal from  AA  through  ZZ.    The  next  cycle  number  is  incremented  by  one  when  a  cycle  is verified. 3.2.2.  Keyer ID is a two digit field assigned by the Chief of Military Pay, used to determine who input a transaction through JDC III. 3.3.  Key Functions: 3.3.1.  Program Function Key (PF#).  Press ALT key and corresponding number simultaneously. 3.3.2.  Enter.  ENTER or RETURN key. 3.3.3.  Escape (Esc).  Esc key (top left corner of keyboard). 3.3.4.  Print screen.  Press shift and PRTSC key simultaneously for JDC III screen print.  Press F7 key for JDC II screen print. 3.3.5.  Tab (to  move the cursor).  TAB key to  move  forward;  shift/TAB key  simultaneously to move backwards. 3.3.6.  Page Down (Pg Dn).  Pg Dn Key or Page Down key right side of key board. 3.3.7.  Page Up (Pg Up).  Pg Up key or Page Up key right side of key board. 3.3.8.  Clear JDC II screen.  Press F2 key. 3.4.  Applicable Trans-IDs.  Trans-IDs are four position alphanumeric inputs which identify a specific program function on the DFAS-DE mainframe computer. 3.4.1.  JOLV.    This  function  is  used  to  transfer  the  JDC  III  transactions  from  a  temporary storage  file  to  a  permanent  storage  file.    This  function  is  required  after  an  FSO  or  agent completes  a  file  transfer.  Ensure  the  profile  JAGENTS  has  been  loaded  to  the appropriate  computer  associates  top  secret  (CATS)  user-ID  before  attempting  a  file transfer or the JOLV function. 3.4.2.  JOPS.  This  function  is  used  to  enter  transactions  on-line.  Bases  have  the  ability  to enter transactions 24 hours a day. 3.4.3.  JQEV.    This  function  is  used  by  the  QE  section  to  view,  correct,  verify  and  print transactions, and display the cycles received by DFAS-DE. 3.4.4.  JUPD.  This function allows the user to receive DJMS update results from the current and four preceding, updates.   Output results are usually ready the morning after the update.  Bases have the ability to receive update results 24 hours a day. 3.4.5.  JVSN.    This  function  is  used  to  change  the  destination  of  output  products  for  an ADSN. 94  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Section 3B—JDC III Instructions. 3.5.  Sign-on.  JDC  III  is  used  with  a  stand-alone  personal  computer.    You  do  not  need communications  with  DFAS-DE  to  key  transactions.    JDC  III  must  be  installed  on  the  hard disk  drive  of  your personal computer.  NOTE:  JDC III can be installed or updated from either the A: or B: drive from either 5 1/4” or 3 1/2” disks.  To install JDC III follow these steps: 3.5.1.  Insert  the  installation  disk  (system  disk  8)  in  either  the  A:  or  B:  drive,  whichever  is appropriate for the disk type (3 1/2” or 5 1/4”). 3.5.2.  From  the  C:\>  prompt  type  “A:”  if  you  are  using  the  A:  drive  or  “B:”  if  you  are using the B: drive then press <ENTER>. 3.5.3.  At  the  A:\>  prompt  or  B:\>  prompt,  whichever  is  appropriate,  type  “setup” then  press <ENTER>. 3.5.4.  Follow the on screen instructions carefully, and ensure that all eight systems disks are copied. 3.5.5.  Follow the same procedures listed above for installing changes to JDC III.  Normally when you install changes there will be only one disk.  The change disk will be the installation disk. 3.5.6.  In the past the system forced users to update all eight system disks anytime a change to JDC III was installed.  This will no longer be done with the new installation/update program. 3.6.  Add  Transactions.  The  Add  transactions  option  allows  you  to  begin  processing transactions.    From  the Main Menu,  press  the letter "A" and  you  will receive a prompt  for the Format-ID  and  ACTN  indicator  of  a  DJMS  input  transaction.  Key  the  Format-ID  and  ACTN indicator to receive a prompted screen.  (See Figure 3.3). 3.6.1.  All  prompted  fields  on the  screen are edited  when keyed,  except the SSN and  name.  When a field contains an error, you must correct the initial error before proceeding with the next  field.    After  all  fields  have  been  keyed,  the  transaction  is  re-edited  before  the  input source  is  entered.  If the transaction  contains  multiple  field  errors,  the  cursor  will  return  to the  field  in  error.    The  processing  starts  again  with  the  editing  of  the  changed  data.  If  the transaction  passes  the  edits,  the  transaction  is  added  to  the  accepted  transaction  file  on  the microcomputer and the  message  "Transaction  was added"  is  displayed  at  the  bottom  of  the screen.  (See Figure 3.4). 3.6.2.  At  anytime  before  the  transaction  has  been  accepted  (passed  the  edits),  you  can cancel  the  transaction  by  pressing  the  "F6"  key.  The  transaction  will  not  be  assigned  a sequence  number  and  will  not  be  written  to  the  transaction  file.    To  enter  a  different  DJMS-AC  input  transaction,  enter  the  Format-ID  and  ACTN  Indicator  in  the  NEXT REQUEST  field  and  press  ENTER.    A  new  prompted  screen  will  appear.    When  the transaction is accepted, the  data is automatically  formatted  into a 80 record transaction and stored  in  the  microcomputer  for  file  transfer  to  DFAS-DE.   Exit  the data  entry  function by placing an "X" in the NEXT REQUEST field. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 95  3.6.3.  The  NEXT  REQUEST  field  will  contain  the  same  Format-ID  as  the  previous transaction.    By  pressing  the  "ENTER"  key,  after  the  previous  transaction  has  passed  the edits,  the  same  transaction  screen  will appear.  The  SSN and name  fields  will  be erased but the  common  area  is  retained.  The  F3  key  will  carry  over  the  SSN  and  name  from  the previous  transaction.    This  makes  duplicating  any  fields that are  not changed  easier.  After keying the new SSN and the name, simply "tab" to the field(s) that need to be  changed.  By pressing  the  "Pg  Dn"  after  keying  the  changed  data,  the  cursor  will  go  to  the  input  source field.  If this field is also unchanged, either press the "Pg Dn" key again or press the ENTER key.  The transaction then will be edited for multiple field edits as explained above. 3.6.4.  When a transaction requires a trailer record, the trailer record prompt is displayed when all data fields  for the  prime record pass  the  edits.   When all trailer(s) record  fields  pass the edits, the NEXT REQUEST field (as described above) function takes effect. in  payment  and  collection 3.6.5.  The  money  amounts transaction  prime  records accumulate until a total record is input.  The total of the monies in the prime records and the amount in the total  record is automatically  displayed  after  the  total  record  is  input  so  you can  visually  ensure  that  totals  match. (See  Figure  3.5)    If  the  amounts  do  not  match,  the money  fields  can  now  be  changed  or  corrected.  (See  Transaction  Correction  function.)   If the  money amounts  do  match,  press  ENTER  to add  the transaction to the end of the field.  If the total monies in the prime records are changed, then the total record will show the new detail totals.  (Payment and  collection transactions  should  not  be  entered  by an agent  office without prior approval from the parent FSO.) 3.7.  Exit to DOS.  Key in the letter "X" to return to the DOS prompt. 3.8.  New Cycle (New Day).  The New Cycle (New Day)  function allows you to  change  cycle numbers during the day.  This function will delete the file containing the transactions on the hard drive  from  a  previous  cycle.    (NOTE:    DO  NOT  EXECUTE  THIS  BEFORE  YOU  HAVE TRANSFERRED  YOUR  TRANSACTIONS  TO  A  FLOPPY  DISK  OR  THEY  WILL  BE LOST.)    When  you  press  the  "N"  key  from  the  Main  Menu  you  will  receive  a  warning message  (THIS  SELECTION  WILL  DELETE  THE  AFAFC.DAT  AND  PNTR.FLE  FILES ON  C:\JDC\DATA\.    ENTER  "Q"  TO  QUIT  AND  RETURN  TO  MENU.    ENTER  C  TO CONTINUE.).    After  the  files  are  erased,  you  will  be  requested  to  provide  your  keyer  ID, ADSN and your next cycle number.  (See Figure 3.1)  The Main Menu will appear and you can begin creating transactions by pressing the A key. 3.9.  Correct  Transactions.  The  correct  transactions  function  allows  you  to  change  the ADSN, cycle number and transaction(s) stored on your hard drive. 3.9.1.  From  the  Main  Menu,  press  the  letter  "C"  and  you  will  receive  the  "CORRECT SELECTION" menu.   Enter "A" to  change the ADSN, "C" to change the cycle number and "T"  to  correct  the  transactions.    If  you  select  "T"  you  will  receive  a  prompt  for  the transaction  number  to  be  corrected.    (See  Figure  3.6)  Enter  the  transaction  number  of  the transaction  to be corrected and  press  ENTER.  When the  transaction appears  on  the  screen, move the cursor to the incorrect data and re-key that portion of the transaction. 96 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.9.2.  All  data  entry  edits  are  performed  on  transactions  in  the  transaction  correction function.    The  fields  will  be  re-edited  as  you  tab  through  each  field.    The  complete transaction  will  be re-edited before the input source is entered.   The ADSN, cycle number, transaction  number or  trailer  record indicator cannot be changed when you are correcting a transaction. 3.10.  Delete  Transactions.  The delete  transactions  function allows you to  place a delete code in a transaction stored on your hard drive. 3.10.1.  If  a  transaction  has  a  delete  code  ("DELE"  in  character  positions  6-9),  it  will  be stripped  off  programmatically  before  being  released  into  the  DJMS  update.  To  delete  a transaction, press the letter "D" from the Main Menu.   A prompt will appear requesting the transaction  number  to  be  deleted.  (See  Figure  3.8)    After  keying  the  transaction  number and  pressing  the  ENTER  key,  the  complete  transaction  will  appear  on  the  screen,  with  a message, "DELETE THIS TRANSACTION Y OR N" (See Figure 3.8)  This allows you to view  the  transaction  to  ensure  it  is  the  transaction  you  want  to  delete.    To  delete  the transaction, press the "Y" key. 3.10.2.  If, after the transaction appears, you decide not to delete the transaction, press the "N" key.  If,  after  deleting  the  transaction,  you  decide  the  deletion  was  an  error,  return  to  the Transaction  Correction  function  and  re-key  character  position  6-9  (SSN  field)  with  the correct  SSN.    If  another  transaction  is  to  be  deleted,  enter  the  transaction  number  in  the NEXT  REQUEST  field  and  press  ENTER. Return  to the Main  Menu  by  placing an "X"  in the NEXT REQUEST field. 3.11.  View  Transactions.  The  View  transactions  function  allows  you  to  view  transactions stored on your hard drive. 3.11.1.  From  the  Main  Menu  press  the  "V"  key  and  you  will  receive  a  prompt  asking, "START  AT  THE  1ST?  ENTER  Y  OR  N".    (See  Figure  3.9)    By  pressing  the  "Y"  the complete cycle will appear  on the screen(s).  You may page backward or forward within the cycle  by  pressing  the  Pg  Up  or  Pg  Dn  keys.    By  pressing  the  "N"  key  at  the  prompt,  a prompt  will  ask  for  "STARTING  TRANSACTION  NUMBER".    (See  Figure  3.10)    By entering  the  Starting  Sequence  Number  and  pressing  ENTER,  that  transaction  and  all subsequent transactions in the cycle will appear on the screen(s). 3.11.2.  You  can print transactions  screen-by-screen  while in the Transaction  View  function by  using  Print  Screen.  (See  CRT  Keyboard  instructions.)  To  exit  the  Transaction  View function, press the Esc KEY. 3.12.  Print Transactions.  The Print  transactions  function allows  you to  print transactions  for auditing. By pressing the "P" from the Main Menu you will receive a prompt asking "START AT THE 1ST ENTER Y OR N".   (See Figure 3.11).  By pressing the "Y" the complete  cycle  will print.   By  pressing  the  "N"  a  prompt  will appear asking  what transaction  number  to  begin and end  with.    (See  Figure  3.12).    Enter  the  beginning  and  ending  transaction  number  and  press ENTER.  Only those transactions requested will print. If you decide not to print any transaction, press  the  Esc key  before  pressing the Y  or N key at the  first prompt and  you  will return to the Main  Menu.    You  will  automatically  return  to  the  Main  Menu  after  the  transactions  requested begin printing. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 97  transactions  function  allows  you 3.13.  Transfer  Transactions.  The  Transfer to  copy transactions  from your hard drive to a floppy diskette or from a floppy diskette to a hard drive. By  pressing  the  "T"  from  the  Main  Menu  you  will  receive  a  Transfer  Selection  menu  screen.  Enter  "X"  to  return  to  the  Main  Menu,  "M"  to  copy  transactions  from  your  hard  drive  to  a floppy  diskette  and  "L"  to  copy  transactions  from  a  floppy diskette to your hard drive.  A copy of  JDC  III  cycles  should  be  kept  on  a  floppy  diskette  until  processed  through  the  update. NOTE:  This  selection  will  overwrite  any  previously  keyed  data.  Ensure  any  transactions  you had on your hard drive were transferred to floppy diskette prior to transferring transactions from a floppy diskette to your hard drive. 3.14.  File  Transfer.  To  begin  the  file  transfer  of  the  transactions  on  your  hard  drive  to  a floppy diskette using the transfer  function,  follow the  steps below to  transfer your  transactions from a floppy diskette to DFAS-DE to be included in the next DJMS-AC update: 3.14.1.  If you are in JDC exit from the MAIN menu to the DOS prompt. 3.14.2.  Change  from  the  JDC  directory  to  your  communication  directory  by  keying  the command "cd \directory name (the directory name should be "COMM") and press enter. 3.14.3.  To activate communications, key in the command "LOADSNA", and press enter. 3.14.4.  Toggle to the sign-on  screen by pressing both shift keys  simultaneously.

After  each  message  is  received  press  enter.  The  screen  will  display,  "FILE TRANSFER COMMAND  BEING  PROCESSED  and  "SEND  B:    AFAFC.DAT  AGTINP".  The screen will also show the number of characters (not transactions) transferred so far.  Wait for the message, "TRANS03 TRANSFER COMPLETE". 3.14.10.  TO  TOGGLE  TO  THE  COMMUNICATIONS  SCREEN  press  both  SHIFT  keys simultaneously.    You  will  receive  another  message,  "TRANS  03  FILE  TRANSFER COMPLETE".   Press F2 to  clear the  screen.  NOTE::  At this  point  your data has  been  sent from  your  PC  to  the  mainframe,  but  is  located  in  a  temporary  storage  area  that  is  overlaid each time you do a "SENDDATA". 3.14.11.  Key in "JOLV", and press ENTER.  This puts the transactions in a permanent storage area  for  inclusion  in  the  next  DJMS-AC  update.    This  function  transfers  your  transactions from  temporary to  permanent  storage.   The  JUMPS  File  Transfer  Report  will  appear  with the  number  of transactions passed to the DJMS update.  "JOLV" must be entered after each cycle  is  transmitted.    "JOLV" allows the user to  correct SSN and name errors or to  print a listing of errors for correction at a later time. 98 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.14.12.

Step  "L"  transfers  the  transactions  from  the  temporary  storage  area  to  a permanent  file at DFAS-DE.   ALL  STEPS  MUST BE PERFORMED or the file will not be included in the DJMS update. Section 3C—JDC II Instructions. 3.15.  Sign-on.  To  gain  access  to  JDC  II  you  must  have  an  active  communication  line  to DFAS-DE.  To activate your communications software take the following steps: 3.15.1.  From  your  communication  directory  key  in  the  command  "LOADSNA",  and  press enter. 3.15.2.  Toggle  to  the  sign-on  screen  (see  Figure  3.13)  by  pressing  both  shift  keys simultaneously.  When  you  receive  the  sign-on  screen,  key  in  your  "USERID"  and "PASSWORD", and press ENTER. 3.15.3.  When  you  receive  the  application  selection  screen  (Figure  3.14),  select  CICSJ3, and press ENTER. 3.15.4.  When the  screen displays "SIGN-ON IS COMPLETE"  you are  ready to key in the appropriate "TRANS-ID" to  gain access to a  specific program on the DFAS-DE  mainframe computer.  The paragraphs below contains the instructions for accessing each "TRANS-ID". 3.16.  JOPS.  To  enter  transactions  key  in  "JOPS",  and  press  enter.    You  will  receive  a  menu screen (see Figure 3.15) that allows transaction input (Format-ID and Action Indicator).  You can go to a help screen by pressing PF1 (Alt/1 on your PC) (see Figure 3.16) or a view delete screen by pressing PF2 (Alt/2 on your PC.)  (See View-Delete Function, Figure 3.17). 3.16.1.  By  entering  the  Format-ID  and  Action  Indicator  of  a  DJMS-AC  input  transaction you will receive a prompted screen (Figure 3.18) or a generalized screen (Figure 3.19).  All prompted fields on the screen are edited, including SSN and name.  The SSN and name edits are bypassed if the first position of the Action indicator is a "3", indicating a recent accession. When  a  field  contains  an  error,  the  formatted  screen  is  returned  to  the  user  displaying  the error(s) so corrections can be made (see Figure 3.20).  The processing  starts again  with the editing of the changed data.  If the transaction passes the edits, the transaction is added to the accepted transaction file at DFAS and the cycle and number are displayed. 3.16.2.  The  NEXT  REQUEST  field  will  contain  the  same  Format-ID  as  the  previous transaction.  When  the  previous  transaction  passes  all  edits,  the  SSN  and  name  fields  are erased  and  the  common  area  is  retained.    This  facilitates  duplicating  any  fields  of  the transaction that are not changed.  If you want a  different  DJMS-AC input  transaction, enter the  Format-ID  and  Action  Indicator  in  the  NEXT  REQUEST  field  and  the  new  prompted format  will  be  displayed  after  the  previous  transaction  is accepted.   At anytime before the transaction  has  been  accepted  (passed  the  edits),  the  user  can  cancel  the  transaction  by AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 99  pressing PF6 (Alt/6  on  your PC).   The  transaction  will not  be assigned a  sequence  number and will not be written to the transaction file. 3.16.3.  When  a  transaction  requires  a  trailer  record,  the  trailer  record  prompt  is  displayed when  all  data  fields  for  the  prime  record  passes  the  edits.    When  all  trailer(s)  record  fields pass the edits, the NEXT REQUEST field (as described above) function takes effect. 3.16.4.  The  money  amounts  in  pay  and  collection  transaction  prime  records  accumulate until a total record is input.  The total of the monies in the prime records and the amount in the total record are displayed before acceptance to allow visual verification that the totals match.  The money amounts can now be changed or corrected.  Press enter to add the transaction to the  end  of  the  file.    If  a  user  is  not  authorized  the  P  &  C  function  the  prompt  screen  will appear.    When  the  data  is  edited  at  DFAS,  the  user  will  get  a  message  that  he/she  is  not authorized the P&C function. 3.16.5.  When  all  fields  in  a  transaction  pass  the  edits,  the  data  is  formatted  into  an  80 character record and  stored at DFAS until the  next DJMS-AC update.

After the cycle is verified, transactions can only be deleted, not changed. 3.17.3.1.  Enter the cycle and transaction number you want to change from the QUALITY EXAMINATION MENU.   When the transaction appears on the screen, move the cursor to  the  incorrect  data.    Press  the  ENTER  key  after  keying  the  changes.    The  message "CYCLE  ** TRANS  **** PROCESSED"  will be  displayed.  If  you  make changes to a transaction and decide no correction is needed, press "PF6" (Alt/6 on your PC).  This will cancel the changes and restore the transaction to its  original  data and the  message, "NO CHANGE  TO  TRAN-NUM  ****"  will  be  displayed.  When  you  are  finished correcting a transaction, press ENTER.  The next transaction from the cycle, based on transaction  number,  will appear.  You  can also  request a  specific  transaction by placing the cycle and/or transaction number in the area at the bottom of the screen.  To return to the QUALITY EXAMINATION MENU, place an "X" in the "CYCLE ( )" area. 3.17.3.2.  No edits are performed when a transaction is corrected in this function.  If the correction is erroneous, the transaction will reject in the DJMS-AC update.  You cannot change  the  ADSN,  cycle  number,  transaction  number,  or  trailer  record  indicator.    The QE CORRECT TRANSACTIONS screen is displayed in Figure 3.24. 3.17.4.  Verify Function.

Extracting  Daily  Register  of  Transactions  (DROT)  Data  from  the  Document Transmittal List (DTL).  These procedures allow the DROT to be extracted from the DTL after the DTL is written to a hard  drive.    After  the DTL  is received,  you need to  copy it to a  floppy diskette  to  retain  it  since  this  procedure  deletes  the  DTL.    Take  the  following  steps  to  extract DROT data from the DTL: 3.23.1.  Reboot  by  pressing  CTRL,  ALT,  and  DEL  keys  simultaneously  because  DROT cannot run when communications are active.  This action will sever your communications and will require you to reestablish connectivity with DFAS-DE. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 105  3.23.2.

Individuals  who  need  access  to  the  DJMS  Master  Military  Pay  Account (MMPA) must have their finance office trusted agents (TAs) prepare the necessary paperwork to establish a DJMS user ID.  Prior to obtaining DJMS access, the TA must brief the individual on computer  security  awareness  and  responsibilities  when  accessing  a  service  member’s  pay account.  Once  this  is  done,  the  individual  may  be  given  the  requested  access  within  existing policy and regulations. 3.26.  Assistance  with  Security  Issues/Important  Numbers  to  Remember.  The  Special Actions  Security  Office  is  available  for  assistance  with  any  DJMS  security  problems  that the  TA  or  FSO  cannot  resolve.    The  SA  Security  Office  can  be  reached  via  the  below  listed numbers  and  e-mail  address:    Monday  –  Friday,  7:30  a.m.  to  4:00  p.m.  mountain  time  zone (Denver):             Phone Number: DSN 926-6631 Comm (303) 676-6631 Fax Number: DSN 926-8340 Comm (303) 676-8340 E-mail Address:  DFAS-IN Air Force Security (dfas-inairforcesecurity@dfas.mil) Monday – Friday, 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. eastern standard time Phone Number: DSN 699-2873, 4310, 7500, 7608, 7981, 7182, 7166, 7179, 7114 Comm (317) 510-2873, 4310, 7500, 7608, 7981, 7182, 7166, 7179, 7114 All above phone numbers have voice mail. 3.27.  Appointment of DJMS TAs.  The FSO, or equivalent, will ensure that a TA is designated for every work and/or office area physically located at the site or at least one primary and one alternate  TA  are  appointed  at  the  base  at  all  times.    The  FSO  should  appoint  people  from within the Military Pay SMA who, in his/her judgment, are reliable and will not compromise the system.  When a TA is reassigned, the FSO will ensure that the paperwork to add the new TA and delete the old TA is completed prior to the TA’s departure. 3.27.1.  The request for appointment is made via a trusted agent letter, along with a completed “initial”  DD  Form  2875  (parts  I-IV  (SAAR))  (only  if  the  TA  does  not  currently  have  a USERID)  and  part  V (OS/390)  for  each TA  USERID.   If  the appointment is a replacement of  an  existing  TA,  a  completed  “deletion”  DD  Form  2875  (Part  V  (OS/390)  must  also  be submitted to remove the old TA from the system. 3.27.2.  Upon  receipt  of  the  paperwork,  the  security  office  will  ensure  that  the  forms  are filled  out completely and  correctly.   If  the  forms are  not  completed  correctly,  the  facsimile copy  will  be  discarded  and  an  e-mail  will  be  sent  to  the  originating  TA.    If  the  forms  are AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 107  correct,  the  security  office  will  add  security  privileges  to  the  current  USERID  or  create  a USERID  if  needed  for  each  TA  and  provide  e-mail  notification  the  USERID  has  been created.    In  this  e-mail,  the  security  office  will  also  include  a  small  package  of  security information  for  the  TA  to  read.  The  USERIDs  can  then  be  used  to  administer  DJMS computer security. 3.28.  Additional  TA  Responsibilities.  The  TAs  at  each  site  are  responsible  for  all  of  the USERIDs under the control of their FSO.  In addition, the TAs will: 3.28.1.  Read and become familiar with: 3.28.1.1.  "Security  Access  To  DJMS"  in  this  chapter.  (This  will  be  forwarded  to  each new TA by the Security Office.) 3.28.1.2.  The  DFAS  Denver  Handbook  8000.1,  "Defense  Finance  and  Accounting Service  -  Denver  Center,  Information  Systems  Security  (INFOSEC)  Handbook".   (This  can  be  found  at  address  https://dfas4dod.dfas.mil/library/hbk80001.htm  on  the internet.) 3.28.1.3.  The  DoD  Directive  5200.28,  "Security  Requirements Information http://web7.whs.osd.mil/html/520028.htm on the internet.) (AISs)". Systems found  (This can be for  Automated address  at 3.28.1.4.  Defense  Joint  Military  Pay  System  (DJMS)  and  Defense  Military  Pay  Office (DMO)  and  Army  Case  Management  System  Trusted  Agent/Terminal  Area  Security Officer (TASO) Procedures Manual. 3.28.2.  Not allow access to DJMS without first determining a need for the access. 3.28.3.  Prepare  and  maintain  original  (signed)  DD  Forms  2875  for  each  USERID  within their area of responsibility. 3.28.4.  Submit  proper  documentation  to  the  Security  Office  for  USERIDs  to  be  created, modified,  or  deleted.   (For  security reasons,  these  documents  will  only be  submitted by the TAs.) 3.28.5.  For  audit  purposes,  keep  all  printed  DD  Forms  2875  in  a  locked  area  and  all electronic  forms  in  a  secure  area.    When  relieved  of  TA  responsibilities,  the  out-going  TA will pass all documentation to the new TA. 3.28.6.  Maintain DD Forms 2875 for USERIDs that have been deleted from the system, for a period of one year from the date of deletion. 3.28.7.  Assist  their  users  by  unsuspending  USERIDS  and/or  resetting  passwords.  This responsibility  also  requires  analysis  of  why  a  USERID  was  suspended  (i.e.,  was  the  user trying to access an application that has not been approved?).  Once the problem is identified, appropriate corrective action will be taken by the TA. 3.28.8.  Be observant of any unauthorized personnel around their terminal  area.  Report any suspicious behavior. 3.28.9.  Notify  the individuals within their area, who have USERIDs, of their responsibility for DJMS security.  The TA is the first line of defense for all DJMS security problems. 108 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.28.10.  Complete a  USERID  validation  every  month,  per  paragraph 3.41  in this  section, and forward the results to the Security Office by the first day of the following month. 3.28.11.  Keep  a  TA  book  that  includes  all  of  the  information  provided  by  the  Security Office.  When relieved of TA responsibilities, the TA will pass this book on to the new TA. Because  of  the  sensitive  nature  of  some  of  the  information,  this  book  must  be  kept  in  a locked area. 3.29.  Completion  of  the  Trusted  Agent  Letter.  A  new  Trusted  Agent  Letter  is  required whenever there is a  change in TA.   For  security reasons, the letter  must  be  filled  out  correctly, without  any  changes  or strikeovers,  or  we  must request a new letter  from  the  FSO.   The  letter consists  of  2  pages;  both  must  be  faxed  (along  with  any  required  DD  Forms  2875)  to  the Security Office as one complete package. 3.29.1.  Page 1 of the Trusted Agent Letter. 3.29.1.1.  Date:  Type in the current date. 3.29.1.2.  From:  Type in the organization name and the location of the TA. 3.29.1.3.

If the  TA  is  stationed  overseas,  the  country  code  must  be added to the DSN number. 3.29.1.8.  Fax  #  Comm/DSN:  Type in  the two  complete  fax numbers,  commercial  first, then DSN. If  the  TA is  stationed  overseas, the  country  code must be added to  the DSN number. 3.29.1.9.  FSO or Comptroller  or Division  Chief Signature  & Signature Block:  Type in the FSO's or Comptroller's full signature block. 3.29.2.  Page 2  of the Trusted  Agent  Letter.  The two TAs  must  sign the  form at  the  bottom after reading the complete Trusted Agent Letter. 3.30.  Completion of the DD Form 2875.  For  security reasons, the DD  Form 2875  must also be filled out correctly and completely, without any changes or strikeovers, or a new form will be requested.  All DD Form 2875 must be typed. 3.30.1.  When filling out the DD Form 2875, the TA will type the information into the Form Flow  or  Word  document  that  was  provided  by  the  Security  Office.    When  the  Parts  I-IV (SAAR) is required, the TA requests the Security Manager complete Part III of the DD Form 2875.  The TA obtains the signatures and dates on the form. 3.30.2.  Completing  the  DD  Form  2875,  Parts  I-IV  (SAAR).    See  Figure  3.46  for instructions/information concerning completion of the 2875. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 109   3.31.  Submission of Paperwork for DJMS USERIDs.  For  audit  purposes,  TAs  are  tasked with  the completion and  the  maintaining of all DD  Forms 2875 (Parts  I-IV [SAAR] and  Part V  [OS/390]) and Trusted Agent Letters within their area of responsibility.   If a DD Form 2875 or Trusted  Agent Letter is required for any level of access, a copy of it must reside in the TA’s files. 3.31.1.  TA  USERIDS.    The  Security  Office  will  create,  modify,  and  delete  USERIDs  for TAs  based  on  properly  completed  DD  Forms  2875.    Please  note  that  a  minimum  of  a Background  Investigation  (BI)  is  required  to  establish  a  USERID  and  forms  must  contain all appropriate  signatures.   Foreign Nationals  will  have a  host  nation agreement  or a  status of forces agreement equivalent background check and this will be indicated on the DD Form 2875 in Part II. 3.31.1.1.  DD  Forms  2875  may  only  be  submitted  by  appointed  TAs;  the  Trusted Agent Letter must  be  signed by  the  FSO (or  equivalent) and  must  be  forwarded  by  the TA.   All TA requests must be faxed to the Security Office.  For "Initial" requests, a DD Form 2875, Parts I-IV (SAAR) and Part V (OS/390), along with the Trusted Agent Letter, must  be  completed;  and  all  forms  must  be  submitted  to  the  Security  Office.    For "Modification"  requests,  a  DD  Form  2875,  Part  V  (OS/390),  must  be  completed  and submitted  to  the  Security  Office.    For  "Deletion"  requests,  a  DD  Form  2875,  Part  V (OS/390), must be completed and submitted to the Security Office. 3.31.1.2.  Once the Security Office has completed the request, the ISSO will return it to the TA via fax.  The TA will be notified of completion via e-mail. 3.31.2.  Local National Requests.  If a TA or non-TA is a local national, all paperwork must be faxed, with signatures, to the security office. 3.31.2.1.  DD Forms 2875 will only be submitted by appointed TAs.  All non-TA requests must  be  e-mailed  to  the  security  office  security  mailbox.   For  "Initial"  requests,  a  DD Form 2875, Parts I-IV (SAAR) and Part V (OS/390), must be completed; however, only the  Part  V (OS/390) should  be  submitted  to  the  Security  Office.    The  DD  Form  2875, Parts  I-IV  (SAAR)  will  remain  in  the TA's  files,  with all  required  signatures,  for audit purposes.    For  "Modification"  requests,  a  DD  Form  2875,  Part  V  (OS/390)  must  be completed  and  submitted  to  the  Security  Office.    For  "Deletion"  requests,  a  DD  Form 2875, Part V (OS/390) must be completed and submitted to the Security Office. 3.31.2.2.  Once  the  Security  Office  has  completed  the  request,  it  will  be  signed  by  the ISSO and returned to the TA via fax.  The TA will be notified of completion via e-mail. 3.31.3.  Local National Requests.  If a TA or non-TA is a local national, all paperwork must be faxed, with signatures, to the Security Office. 3.31.3.1.  DD  Form  2875  will  only  be  submitted  by  appointed  TAs.   All  local  national requests must be  faxed to the Security Office.   For  "Initial" requests, a DD Form 2875, Parts I-IV (SAAR) and Part V (OS/390), must be completed and submitted to the Security Office.  For  "Modification"  requests,  a  DD  Form  2875,  Part  V  (OS/390),  must  be completed  and  submitted  to  the  Security  Office.    For  "Deletion" requests, a DD Form 2875, Part V (OS/390), must be completed and submitted to the Security Office. 110 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.32.  Assignment  of  Profiles.  Users  must  have  profiles  that  provide  the  access  required  to perform  their  duties.    The  TAs  are  the  user’s  source  of  information  regarding  the  profiles needed.   The  following  table  describes the most commonly used profiles by name, description, and  most  popular  execution  commands.  Please  keep  in  mind  that  the  user  must  have  profile JJUMPSR (Air Force Inquiry Access) for most of the other profiles below to work properly.  TA profile JMPJYBM will work by itself. Profile Name    Function of the Profile or Subsystem                                Authorized Commands JJUMPSR Air Force inquiry to MMPAs (DJMS AC and DJMS RC) JJAA, JLES,   JJUPDPFL JAGENTS     View/Print Update Results ADSN/Agent File Transfer JDCIII JPPCCPFL Paying and Collecting Transactions JPJOPS Field On-LINE Processing System  JPBBPFL JPBXPFL (Except for Paying and Collecting Transactions) Input EFT Payments Verify/Release EFT Payments JMCLRPFL Message Log Read Authority  (Latest JUMPS Messages) JNPARMKS Net Pay Advice Remarks WATIF2 ADSN What-if for Separations JPQEPFL AFSAR JOPS Quality Assurance View/Print Report Data (Air Force) AFRGSAR View/Print Report Data (AFR and ANG)  Reserves and Air National Guard) ROTSCAR View/Print Report Data (ROTC) REPORT WEB View/Print Report Data JMPJYBM Add ADSN and Printer ID to a USERID     (Profile for TAs Only) MSO, PARM, PRAA, JCCM JUPD, JVSN JOLV, JQEV, IND$ JOPS JOPS JPBB JPBX JAUO JLNA JPAM JQEV SAR4 SAR4 SAR4 JYBM      AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 111  NOTE:  ECCS  Mail  Authority  (old  profile  JECCSR,  otran  MAIL)  is  now  automatic  for  all DJMS  USERIDs.   Locator  (old  profile  SLOC8PFL,  otran  LOCA)  is  also  automatic  as  long as  the  user  has  profile  JJUMPSR  (Air  Force  Inquiry  Access).    Reports  Management System  (old  profile  RMSUSR,  otran  RM01)  is  no  longer  a  valid  profile.    It  has  been replaced by the SARJ profile. 3.33.  Separation  of  Duties.  Several  directives  require  “separation  of  duties”  to  minimize  the possibility  of  fraud  and/or  abuse  of  government  resources.    To  limit  the  direct  capability  to input  and  release  payments  within  DJMS,  we  will  not  assigned  the  following combinations  of profiles to any single USERID. NOTE:  Under special circumstances, e.g. not enough personnel in  some RPOS, a  USERID  may  be  given  both  profiles  except  “A”  below.    In  those  cases,  the local instructions  will clearly stipulate that you  can’t  perform the tasks assigned to both  profile sets while processing payment transactions. 3.33.1.  JPBXPFL  (JPBX-Release  EFT  Payments)  and  JPBBPFL  (JPBB-Input  EFT Payments) 3.33.2.  JPJOPS  (Field  O/L  Processing  System)  and  JPQEPFL Assurance) (Auditor  Quality 3.33.3.  JPPCCPFL  (Field Pay/Collection) and JPQEPFL (Auditor Quality Assurance) 3.33.4.  JAGENTS  (JDC3) and JPQEPFL (Auditor Quality Assurance) 3.34.  Initial  Assignment of  a USERID  and  Password.  The Security  Office  will  provide  the TAs  with all their new USERIDs and ensure that the passwords are set to the default password.  This default password is an expired password and will prompt the users to change it upon initial login.  The TAs will  distribute all  new  USERIDs to  the appropriate  personnel and  notify them of  their  initial  log-on  password. The  users  will  then  establish  their  own  passwords.   The  TAs are  not  authorized  to  sign  on  and  change  passwords  for  USERIDs  that  are  issued  to  anyone other than that specific person. 3.34.1.  All  users,  regardless  of  whether  they  are  a  TA  or  a  non-TA,  will  log  on  to  their USERID immediately upon receipt.  USERIDs that have not been logged on to after 5 days from their creation date will be ASUSPENDED. 112 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.34.2.  Valid passwords consist of 6 to 8 alpha-numeric characters; a minimum of 1 character must be  numeric.    Passwords  will  contain  no  consecutively  repeating  characters.

The  DJMS  system-print  destinations  and  assignment  of  ADSNs  are controlled  by  the DJMS  printer  and  ADSN  control  application  JYBM.   Each  DJMS  USERID must be in this application with the USERID tied to the appropriate ADSN (if used) and printer identification.  If not, the user will not be able to perform any functions within DJMS requiring an  ADSN  or  printer.    TAs  must  remember that  when a new  USERID is created, they must run JYBM and add the new user.  TAs must also remember that  when  a  USERID  is  removed  from the system, it is their responsibility to clean up the USERID in JYBM. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 117  3.36.  Sharing  of  USERIDs  and  Passwords.  It  is  extremely  important  to  remember  that personnel  are  not  authorized  to  share  their  USERIDs  and  passwords  with  anyone.    Failure  to comply  will  result  in  that  USERID  being  “asuspended”  in  DJMS.    An  “asuspend”  is  an administrative  suspend  placed  on  a  USERID  by  the  Security  Office  or  a  TA.    TAs  cannot remove  an  “asuspend”  on  a  USERID,  they  can  only  remove  USERID  “suspends.”    If  a  TA USERID is  “asuspended” as a  result  of a  sharing  violation,  the Security Office will require an e-mail  from  the  FSO  to  the  Security  Office  security  mailbox,  stating  that  the  TA  has  been counseled  on  security  protocols regarding  sharing  of  USERIDs and  passwords.   If a  non-TA USERID  is  “asuspended”  because  of  a  sharing  violation,  the  Security  Office  will  require  an e-mail  from the TA to the Security Office  security  mailbox,  stating  that the INDIVIDUAL has been  counseled on  security protocols regarding  sharing of  USERIDs and  passwords.  USERIDs and  passwords  must  be  protected  at  all  times;  personnel  should  protect  their  USERIDs  and passwords  by  memorizing  them.  Do  not  write  them  down  and  post  around  your  area  or  hide them under keyboards. 3.37.  USERIDS Suspension/Deletion.  USERIDs must be used or they will be “asuspended” or deleted. 3.37.1.  The system will automatically “asuspend” a USERID if it is not used within 35 days and the Security Office will delete the USERID if it is not used within a 100-day period.  No notification will  be  sent out  to  the TAs  or FSO, and a new DD  Form 2875 will  be required to  re-establish  a  deleted  USERID.    If  a  user  will  be  going  TDY  or  on  leave  for  an extended  period  of  time,  the  TA  should  notify  the  Security  Office  via  e-mail  (to  the security  mailbox), and the  USERID  will not be deleted after 100  days.   The  USERID  will merely  remain  “asuspended”  and  reviewed  periodically  by  the  Security  Office.    The  TA should follow-up to ensure the Security Office received the e-mail message and has acted on the TA’s request. 3.37.2.  USERIDs  will  also  be  suspended  if  the  individual  uses  the  wrong  password  in  3 consecutive logon attempts or attempts to use an unauthorized application 3 times.  This will place a “suspend” on the USERID, and the TA will have to remove the “suspend.” 3.38.  Changing Passwords. 3.38.1.  TA  passwords  must  be  changed  every  30  days,  and  non-TA  passwords  must  be changed  every  90  days.    If  a  password  has  not  been  changed  within  the  prescribed  time frame, the system will automatically prompt the user to change his/her password at the 30 - or 90-day point. 118 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.38.2.  Passwords  must be unique  each time and not  shared  or given to anyone.  Passwords should  not  be  similar  to  any  previously  used  password.    Valid  passwords  consist  of  6  to  8 alphanumeric  characters;  at  least  1  character  must  be  numeric.    Passwords  will  contain  no consecutively  repeating  characters.    To  change  a  password  prior  to  the  30-  or  90-day timeframe, do the following at the sign-on screen:       Screen #01_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ KLGLGON1 Entry Validation Date: 05/15/01 Time: 10:46:00 System: MMA Device: TMA02501 Identification: Userid.......

TA Management Tools.  TAs have a few TSS (Top Secret Security) commands at their disposal  within DJMS to list, reset, unsuspend, and  suspend their users.    Remember that these commands must be exact  or the  system  will  not accept them.  They are not  case-sensitive (can be  typed  in  either  upper-  or  lower-case);  however,  the  parentheses  MUST  be  typed  where indicated and spaces MUST be typed where indicated.   Type in  one  command in the upper  far-left-hand  corner  of  the  screen  and  hit  the  ENTER  key.  After  the  command  has  processed successfully, a “successful  completion”  message  will appear.   If an “unsuccessful completion” message appears, normally, the  command  was mis-typed.  Sometimes, the  TA will  have to back out of DJMS to the SUPERSESSION Menu, go back in to DJMS, and re-type the command.  If there is a second command, as in the case of a reset, the second command must be typed in after the “completion” message from the first command is received/displayed. 3.39.1.  Commands to list USERIDs. 3.39.1.1.  To list a single user and all of their access: tss list(userid) data(all)            NOTE:  This command lists a single USERID and the access assigned to it. 3.39.1.2.  To list a single user and his/her profiles (only): tss list(userid) data(profiles)           NOTE:  This command lists all profiles assigned to a USERID and the name of the            profiles. 3.39.1.3.  To list all of your users and their access: tss list(acids) data(all) dept(yourdepartment)           NOTE:  This command lists all of your users and the access assigned to each USERID. 3.39.1.4.  To list only the names of all of your users: tss list(acids) data(names) dept(yourdepartment)           NOTE:  This command lists all your users and the name assigned to the USERID. 3.39.2.  Commands to reset, unsuspend, and suspend USERIDs. 3.39.2.1.  To reset a USERID (which changes the password): tss rem(userid) suspend tss rep(userid) pass(defaultpassword, exp) 3.39.2.2.  To unsuspend a USERID (without changing the password): tss rem(userid) suspend 3.39.2.3.  To suspend a USERID: tss add(userid) suspend       122 LEGEND: AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007     userid = The USERID of the individual that you want to list, reset, unsuspend, or suspend defaultpassword = The default password. yourdepartment = The first 5 positions of your USERID NOTE:  An “asuspend” is an administrative suspend on a USERID that can only be removed by the  Security  Office.    The  TA  must  call  or  e-mail  (security  mailbox)  the  Security  Office  and request  removal.    TAs  can  only  remove  a  “suspend”  on  a  USERID.    To  see  whether  a USERID  is  “asuspended”  or  just  “suspended,”  the  TA  can  list  the  USERID  and  look immediately  underneath  the  list  of  profiles.    If  it  says  "ATTRIBUTES =  ASUSPEND," the USERID is “asuspended” and the Security Office must be contacted by the TA for removal.  If it says "ATTRIBUTES = SUSPEND", the USERID is only suspended; and the TA can remove it. 3.40.  Security  Controls.  Following  are  some  of  the  tools  the  Security  Office  has  to  monitor DJMS security for the Air Force. 3.40.1.  A daily audit of security violations, such as repeated attempts to access unauthorized facilities  or  commands,  is  conducted.    Violations  result  in  an  “asuspend”  and  a  message  to the  TA  (FSO  if  the user is a TA)  for investigation  of the  violation(s).   If  a TA  USERID is “asuspended”  due  to  a  security  violation,  the  Security  Office  will  require  an  e-mail  to  the security mailbox  from the FSO  stating the TA has been counseled regarding proper security protocol.  If  a  non-TA  USERID  is  “asuspended”  due  to  a  security  violation,  the  Security Office will require an e-mail to the security mailbox from the TA with the results of the TA’s investigation. 3.40.2.  An audit report of USERIDs, by name, is periodically run to ensure that a user does not  have  a  USERID  at  two  different  installations  or  two  different  USERIDs  at  one installation.   A discrepancy will result in an “asuspend” of the older of the USERIDs and a message to the TA (FSO  if  the user is a  TA)  for  investigation  of  the  violation(s).   If  a  TA USERID is “asuspended” because of a duplicate USERID violation, the Security Office will require  and  e-mail  (to  the  security  mailbox)  from  the  FSO  explaining  the  results  of  the investigation.    If  a  non-TA  USERID  is  “asuspended”  because  of  a  duplicate  USERID violation,  the  Security  Office  will  require  an  e-mail  (to  the  security  mailbox)  from  the  TA explaining the results of the investigation.  Generally,  we  find that a user  has PCS'd and no longer requires the  USERID.  If this is the  case, the TA can  submit the proper paperwork to have the USERID removed from the system. 3.40.3.  Impromptu  audits  are  conducted  by  the  Security  Office  to ensure  TAs  are  properly maintaining  their  completed  DISA  Forms  41.   During  this  audit,  the  TA  will  be  asked  to fax requested DD Form 2875s to the Air Force Security Office.  These DISA Forms 41 will be audited and a report of findings will be typed up and returned to the FSO. 3.41.  Instructions for Monthly Validation by TAS.  Every month, TAS will formally validate the  USERIDs  within  their  area  of  responsibility.  The  TAS  are  required  to  have  the  validation paperwork  available  to  the  Air  Force  security  office  upon  request  at  the  end  of  every  month.  During  the  validation,  DD  Form  2875's  need  to  be  current  and  up  to  date  on  users  access, AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 123  deleted  USERIDs,  deployments/TDY's,  name  changes,  etc.   A  current  TASO  monthly  review agreement  will  need  to  be  sent  to  the  air  force  security  office  when  TASO  assignment changes  at the  base location.  TASO,  supervisor, and  foundation  data owner (FDO)  will need to sign and date the agreement.  TASOs will also need to update their monthly review checklist with TASO signature (primary or alternate) and date of review for auditing purposes.   A random audit will be given by the air force security office on these reviews.  (paragraph 3.39.1.4 in this section indicates the list commands to run the review.) 3.41.1.

TASO DJMS/DMO Monthly Review Checklist:     Section 3E—ROTC Data Collection. 3.42.  See DFAS-DEM 7073-3. Section 3F—Defense Milpay Office (DMO). 3.43.  Description  and  General  Information.  The  Defense  Milpay  Office  (DMO)  is  a windows-based  transaction  input  system  that  consists  of  a  collection  of  separate  and interconnected  screens.    The DMO  software  consists  of various  pay  modules consolidated into one system.  DMO consists of the following primary modules: 3.43.1.  Input  Module.  Provides  capabilities  for  creating  DJMS  (active  and  reserve component) transactions  for upload to DJMS.   Air  force  finance  offices  will  have access to all  allowable  field  transaction  processing  windows.    The    input  module  provides transaction  processing  for  allotments,  allowances,  deductions,  disbursing,  entitlements, debts, incentive pays, member identification, status and remarks. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 125  3.43.2.  Inquiry  Module.   Provides inquiry  capability known as  the DMO  Standard  Inquiry System  (DSIS).    DSIS  displays  the  8,200  data  elements  within  the  MMPA  and  provides tools  to  navigate  through  the  system.    DSIS  can  download  multiple  DJMS  accounts  and can  retrieve  member  history.  See  DFAS-DEM  7073-1,  chapter  5  for  information  on  the standard inquiry system (DMO), standard inquiry system (DSIS). 3.43.3.  Reports/Queries  Module.    Provides  daily  transaction  register  (DTR),  LES,  NPA, W-2  and  MMPA  information  in  a  DB2  database.    All  current  DJMS  offline-reporting functions are incorporated into the reports module.  Database queries can be performed using Microsoft access. 3.43.4.  DMO Record Replication. 3.43.4.1.  General.  In  order  to  make  the  most  of  DMO,  the  FSO  must  have  the  most current information  from the MMPA  downloaded to  the DMO  server.  As the  records in DMO age, the  chances  that  rejects  will  occur  increase.   Eventually,  the  plan  is  to  have mid-tier  servers  at  DECC  which  will allow  finance to process directly  without the need to replicate the data, but until then, finance must replicate the current MMPA from DJMS onto the DMO server on a regular basis.  DMO produces a report for each base indicating the last time DMO records were replicated. 3.43.4.2.  Automatic  Updates.    Use  the  DMOREPL  utility  to  automatically  set  the interval  for  record  replication  (most  sites  have  replication  configured  to  check  the mainframe  every  6  to  8  hours).    When  updating  automatically,  the  DMO  server contacts the mainframe and checks for new or updated data based on ISI.  If new data is available,  it  will  replicate  it  to  the  local  database.  Since  this  new  data  is  based  on nightly  batch  processing,  replication  could  occur  once  per  24  hours.    If  this  data replication  has  not  been  done  in  some  time,  do  a  full  refresh  of  the  DMO  data-  base before setting up the automatic updates. 3.44.  DMO Functional Keys:  Each input  screen includes a title  bar,  menu bar, tool bar and various  pull-down  menus.    Standard  controls  include  radio  buttons,  group  boxes,  drop  down lists, speed buttons and edit boxes.  NOTE:   A button with an underlined letter means alt + the underlined letter can be used as shortcut keys instead of using the mouse.  Common buttons are: 3.44.1.  OK/Enter.  Completes the processing of the selected function and returns to the next logical screen. 3.44.2.  Cancel.  Aborts the current input or processing and returns to the previously selected screen. 3.44.3.  Help.  Displays the help screen. 3.44.4.  Close.  Closes the existing window and returns to the main screen. 3.44.5.  Delete.  Deletes the highlighted transaction in the change/deleted function. 3.44.6.  Pre-fill.  Accesses the local MMPA cache data. 3.44.7.  Print.  Prints the current screen. 3.44.8.  Modify.  Allows correction of a previously entered transaction. 3.44.9.  History.  Displays all transactions submitted for processing. 126 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.44.10.  View.  Displays the submitted transaction. 3.45.

Select “pre-fill” and choose either the local or corporate database. 3.47.2.  New Cycle.  For creating new transaction files or setting up payroll files: 3.47.2.1.  Select “file” and  click  on “new  cycle”.   Select  service (air  force),  component (active) and  servicing  ADSN.   Under “transaction  type”  click “general”  for all types  of transaction, other than misc.  Payroll and collections. 3.47.2.2.  Get  the  cycle  number  from  the  log  book/file  and  enter  it in  the  “cycle”  field. Click “ok” and the FID “launcher” opens. 3.47.2.3.  Enter  a  SSN  and  the  name  should  pre-fill  (from  the  local  or  corporate database).   Select the  transaction  to  be  input  by  entering  the  FID  in  the  “FID/AI/TIN” field or by entering search terms (i.e. BAQ, BAS, etc.)  In the “searchfield”. 3.47.2.4.  Enter  your  two-character  input  source,  as  assigned  by  your  systems manager,  in  the  “input  source”  field  and  click  “ok”  to  open  the  transaction  layout.

Input any new data or select “change/delete” to edit existing transactions. 128 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 3.47.4.  Submitting Transaction(s) for Audit.  To submit transactions to an auditor for review click  on the  “ready  for  audit”  button.   The  transaction  will  disappear  from  the  “open  input files”  window  and reappear  in the  “audit”  window after  you  select “audit”  from  the  “type” dropdown menu.  The auditor can accept or change the transaction(s) in the cycle.  Once the auditor accepts or corrects the transaction, the input is now ready to transmit. 3.47.5.  Cycle Transmit.   The DMO user  with “transmit”  capability  needs  to  log  into DMO by  selecting  “file”  and  click  on  “transmit”  (NOTE:    The  cycle  can  be  viewed  but  not manipulated). 3.47.5.1.  Transmit  Confirmation.    Select  “transmit”  and  a  confirmation  screen  should appear.    The  cycle  appears  in  the  “corporate”  window  when  the  data  has  physically moved to the corporate server at the DECC in Mechanicsburg. 3.47.5.2.  Backing Out Cycles.  To make  changes to the  cycle prior to the DJMS update, select the  cycle  in  the  corporate  region  and  click  “backout”.    The  “backout  complete” message  will  give  notification  that  the  cycle  has  been  returned  to  the  local  server.  After  the  cycle  is  physically  removed  from  DMO-corporate,  the  cycle  will  appear locally as though it never had been transmitted. 3.48.  DMO Power Tools.  The DMO tools available are mass  transactions, scripts,  import and table 23/50 processing. 3.48.1.  Mass Transactions.  The six steps involved in creating mass transactions are: 3.48.1.1.  Select  Desired  Accounts.    Starting  at  the  file  menu  select  open  accounts.  Complete  the  required  information.    Highlight  the  accounts  to  be  included  in  the  mass transaction.  If all transactions are to be included make no individual selections. 3.48.1.2.  Create/Save a SSN file. Create a SSN file to be used to create mass transactions with a “.SSN” extension.  There are two ways to create a SSN file: 3.48.1.2.1.  Creating  a  file  from  accounts  in  database.  From  the  “open  accounts” screen select “SSN  file”.   Name  the  file  (using the “file  name”  field) and  save  it in a  data  folder  or  on  a  floppy.    The  system  will  respond  with  a  confirmation  for creating a SSN file. 3.48.1.2.2.  Creating a file from an imported text (.txt) file. 3.48.1.2.3.  Create/Open  Cycle.    From  the  DMO  input  screen  click  on  “file”  and select “new cycle” or “open cycle”.   Use the “browse” button to locate the SSN file.  At the bottom of the screen select “mass”. 3.48.1.2.4.  Access  the  SSN  File.  Locate  and  open  the  SSN  file.  Click  “ok”  to  the information dialogue box.  This will open the SSN file.  Click “save” to save the file. 3.48.1.2.5.  Select/Create Transaction.   The mass transaction screen will appear after saving the SSN file.  Select the desired FID and click “ok”.  Complete the transaction and click “ok”. 3.48.1.2.6.  Confirm  Creation  Mass  Transactions. the transaction information for all accounts listed in the SSN file and will add them to the cycle (note confirmation at bottom of screen).   DMO  will  complete AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 129  3.48.2.  Scripts 3.48.2.1.  Setup.    DJMS  requires  that  related  transactions  be  submitted  in  a  particular order.  The following are the steps used for setup: 3.48.2.1.1.  click on the “tools” menu 3.48.2.1.2.  click on “create transaction scripts” 3.48.2.1.3.  the transaction is added 3.48.2.1.4.  the follow on FIDs are added 3.48.2.1.5.  the screen will close when finished. 3.48.2.2.  Usage.   Scripts  will keep the transactions in  order and  drop the  transaction(s) needed  to  support  the  event  on  the  screen  in  the  proper  sequence  (transactions  may  be skipped  if  not  applicable).

The daily register of rejects (DROR) is used for control and resolution of all DFAS-DE  rejects.  The  DROR  lists  DFAS-DE  rejects  one  time  only  as  a  separate  product. Rejects will also print on the daily register of transactions (DROT) as information for the input source. 4.2.  FSO Actions: 4.2.1.  Pay Service and Control clerk: 4.2.1.1.  Receives DROR and sends it and source documents to Quality Examination. 4.2.1.2.  If  corrections  are  required  to  source  documents  which  have  already  been submitted  to  the  Denver  Federal  Records  Center  (DFRC),  sends  corrected  source document  with  AF  Form  1209,  Document  Transmittal  (JUMPS),  to  the  DFRC  (see Chapter  2).    Identify  document  transmittal  listing  (DTL)  on  which  original  document was submitted through use of the transmission number and the outgoing transmission log. 4.2.2.  Quality Examination: 4.2.2.1.  Determines  cause  of  error,  corrective  actions  needed,  and  who  is  to  make corrections. 4.2.2.2.  If  corrections  are  required  to  source  documents  originated  outside  FSO, returns  documents  to  input  source  through  Pay  Service  and  Control.    Input  source makes necessary corrections, then sends corrected documents to Quality Examination. 4.2.2.3.  When  corrections  are  required  to  source  documents  originated  within  FSO, instructs the Pay Service and Control Clerk to correct original and FSO-retained copies. 4.2.2.4.  Corrects or cancels improper transactions when appropriate. 4.2.2.5.  Determines  whether rejected transactions, received after  member's departure on permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  or  temporary  duty  (TDY),  can  be  corrected  and resubmitted.  If  transactions  can  be  corrected,  take  action  in  (1)  through  (4)  above.  If transactions  cannot  be  corrected,  advise  gaining  FSO  by  DD  Form  139,  Pay Adjustment  Authorization.    Give  full  explanation  including  reasons  for  reject  and reasons why reject could not be cleared by losing FSO. 4.2.2.6.  Ensure error that caused the reject is corrected and new transaction is input. 4.2.2.7.  Annotates code for action resolving reject in FSO disposition area on right-hand side of DROR.  Codes and description for each are:    CODE DESCRIPTION 1 2 3 Corrected and resubmitted. Error in source document returned to input source. Transaction erroneous, not resubmitted. 184 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 4.3.  Rejects to DFAS-DE/FJ.  Transactions that cannot be processed because the effective date is  outside  immediate  access  storage  (IAS),  or  the  condition  of  the  file  does  not  allow processing,  reject  to DFAS-DE/FJ for action.  These transactions appear in section 3 of the daily transaction record (DTR) with error code ZBD and the error code(s) with which the transaction rejected to DFAS-DE.  An XZ03 notice will be produced to identify the actual error code of the rejected  transaction.    These  rejects  will  be  controlled  by  the  Automated  Case  Control  System (ACCS) by systematically establishing an ACCS case at DFAS-DE/FJ. 4.4.  ACCS Viewing.  In order to view ACCS cases, the following instructions apply: 4.4.1.  Key  in  JCCM,  press  enter,  and  the  Base  Inquiry  Request  Menu  is  displayed.    This menu has three options: 4.4.1.1.  Individual SSN. 4.4.1.2.  Individual SSN and date received. 4.4.1.3.  (DELETED) 4.4.2.  (DELETED) 4.4.2.1.  (DELETED) 4.4.2.2.  (DELETED) 4.4.2.3.  (DELETED) 4.4.2.4.  (DELETED) 4.4.2.5.

Base-level  terminals  are  used  to  inquire  against  a  member's  master military  pay account (MMPA) maintained at DFAS-DE. 5.1.1.  The  principal  uses  of  MMPA  inquiries  are  to  answer  member  inquiries,  resolve  pay problems,  determine  amounts  for  casual  or  partial  payments,  validate  data  on  input transactions, and  ensure proper separation processing and final separation payments. 5.1.2.  Sign-on procedures are  contained in Chapter 3, paragraph 3.15   Once signed on, enter "JJAA", then "ENTER", on first blank screen. 5.2.  CICS MMPA Inquiry Procedures: 5.2.1.  Inquiry Request.  The MMPA inquiries format is a fill-in-the-blanks prompting format (Figure  5.1).  The  prompting  format  is  used to obtain  either a  screen display  or  a  printout, with repeat options. The cursor is pre-positioned at the SSN field.   As  each field is keyed-in,  the  cursor  automatically  moves  to  the  next  field.    If  an  input  field  is  to  be  skipped, depress the  forward tab key and  the  cursor  will move to the next field.   After a request has been  entered  and  results  displayed,  the  blank  prompting  format  reappears  with  the  cursor again positioned at the password field.  An explanation of each field in the prompting format follows: 5.2.1.1.  SSN OR CMD functions are: 5.2.1.1.1.  PAGING.    Use  the  paging  commands  on  Figure  5.1  to  display  the additional  screens  if  a  data  response  fills  more  than  one  screen.    Password  is  not needed for paging. 5.2.1.1.2.  "X".    Use  the  letter  X  in  the  first  position  of  the  SSN  to  clear  both  the screen and memory.   For  compliance  with  Privacy  Act requirements, it is  important that you clear both memory and screen before you leave the terminal. 5.2.1.2.  SSN.  Use  this  nine-position  field  for  the  SSN  of  the  member.  On  successive inquiries to the same MMPA, you need not reenter the SSN; just tab over the SSN field and enter new request. 5.2.1.3.  REQ.  Use this three-position field to identify the MMPA data you need.  You can request a predetermined table of data, an MMPA category, or an individual FORMAT-ID entry. 5.2.1.3.1.  For table requests, enter T and the two-position table number. 5.2.1.3.2.  Enter  category  (Figure  5.3)  in  the  first  position.   Enter  history  indicator (Figure 5.1) in the last position. 5.2.1.3.3.  For FORMAT-ID request, enter FORMAT-ID in the first two positions and the history indicator in the last position. 186 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 5.2.1.3.4.  The  history indicator allows  you to  specify  whether  you  want to see  open and  current-month-closed,  or  history  entries,  or  combinations  of  these  entries. Use  the  letter  'O'  for  open  data  or  leave  blank  for  all  data.    Other  codes  are  also available for your use. 5.2.1.3.5.  On successive inquiries for the same REQ data but for different SSN, you need not reenter the REQ field.  Instead, depress ENTER key after entering new SSN. 5.2.1.4.  PRNT  IND.    This  one-position  field  is  used  to  request  a  print  of  MMPA  data.  The P  can  be  entered  on the  initial request,  or  it can be entered after the  data  has  been viewed on the screen. 5.2.1.5.  NAME.    Used  by  DFAS-DE  only,  this  field  identifies  the  organization  and individual where centrally prepared MMPA prints are to be sent. 5.2.1.6.  MMPA  entries  are  displayed  in  FORMAT-ID  sequence,  grouped  by  open entries and closed entries.  Closed entries are identified by a dash (-) appearing after the FORMAT-ID. 5.2.1.7.  If the requested data will fill more than one screen of data, the first page appears after  the  remaining  pages  are  formatted  and  counted;  therefore,  the  first  page  will initially  read  "Page  1  of  ??".  The  question  marks  will  be  replaced  by  total  pages available. 5.2.2.  History  MMPA  Inquiries.  MMPAs  for  December  1977  (includes  July  through December  1977)  through  current  are  also  available  on-line  via  the  JJAA  inquiry  process.  For  MMPAs  prior  to  July  1977,  a  written  request  from  the  member  or  FSO  must  be submitted  to  DFAS-DE/CX.  The  following  are  instructions  on  accessing  these  MMPA histories: 5.2.2.1.  Once signed on to CICS, enter JJAA at the first blank screen, and press <PF4> to go to the special inquiries screen. 5.2.2.2.  Enter 4, and follow screen instructions to request either several MMPA histories for one member, or same history time frame for several members. 5.2.2.3.  The message ‘JOB XXXXXXXX HAS BEEN SUBMITTED’ will appear at the bottom of the screen when request is entered.  MMPA prints will be directed to the printer associated with the VTAM address assigned to the terminal or PC used.   This may be a local printer within the office or a central printer located outside the office. 5.2.2.4.  Those offices not having inquiry capability for retrieving a member’s history pay records can contact DFAS-DE/CX via telephone or written request. 5.2.3.  System  Messages.    When  the  system  is  unable  to  respond  to  an  inquiry,  a  system message will appear on the screen.  The message is usually self explanatory.  Figure 5.4 lists system messages and actions required. 5.3.  DJMS  Standard  Inquiry  System  (DSIS).  DSIS is  a  windows  95/NT  based,  user-friendly  system  for  inquiry  against  the  MMPA  via  a  personal  computer  (PC).    DSIS enables  you to inquire  the MMPA, through the use of an icon in a windows environment.  One complete MMPA, per request, will be downloaded. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 187  5.3.1.  The left side of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), known as the tree, contains 8 main folders. The  tree  is  the  avenue  to  select  the  appropriate  entry.   All  current  MMPA  entries are available for inquiry with DSIS.  The eight main folders contain the following categories of information: 5.3.1.1.  Member information 5.3.1.2.  Entitlements 5.3.1.3.  Deductions 5.3.1.4.  Payments 5.3.1.5.  ID’s 5.3.1.6.  Allotments 5.3.1.7.  Status 5.3.1.8.  Remarks 5.3.2.  All  data  is  displayed  with  English  captions  and  descriptions,  and  an  extensive  on-line help facility is included. 5.3.3.  Figure 5.5 is a sample main screen and Figure 5.6 is a sample MMPA entry inquiry. 5.4.  Inquiry  Tables.  An  inquiry  table  is  a  predetermined  set  of  MMPA  entries  which  can  be requested by entering the three-position table number in the REQ field.  (See Figure 5.5). 5.4.1.  The tables are established by DFAS-DE.  New or revised tables are mailed to FSO. 5.4.2.  Send FSO requests for new or revised tables to DFAS-DE/FJEP.  State the purpose of the  proposed  table,  estimate  the  daily  usage  at  the  requesting  office,  and  list  the  preferred sequence  of  items  to  be  displayed.    Tables  must  have  common  requirements  at  most  or  all bases. 5.5.  Release  of  Information  From  Military  Pay  Records.  Privacy  Act  Rules  governing  the release of information from DJMS are found in Chapter 82 of this volume. 5.6.  Types of Inquiries: 5.6.1.  Routine inquiries are those that can be answered by viewing the MMPA. 5.6.2.  Other  inquiries  are,  for  example,  requests  for  data  before  DJMS  was  implemented and  questions  concerning  data  received  as  a  result  of  an  inquiry.  The  requester  must  be certain that the inquiry is clear and that all necessary information is included. 5.7.  Source of Input.  The FSO receives inquiries from sources outside finance. They include, but are not limited to: 5.7.1.  Member. 5.7.2.  Member's dependent. 5.7.3.  HQ USAF. 5.7.4.  Other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies. 5.7.5.  Other agencies of the US Government. 188 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 5.7.6.  Service organizations. 5.7.7.  Individuals (interested parties with need to know). 5.7.8.  Military Personnel Flights (MPFs).  Inquiries are limited to requests for formats (CAT I)  or  categories  that  are  the  responsibility  of  the  MPF  for  input  to  DJMS.    All  other inquiries must be made through the FSO. 5.8.  Requests  for  Source  Documents.  All requests for copies of source documents must be in writing and submitted via fax, email at CIN-RECMgt@dfas.mil, or mailed as indicated below, and include the  month and year of the document, date, accession number, and/or box number if known, in addition to information below.

View  this  file  on  CICS  similarly  to  the  way  the MMPA is viewed. 5.9.1.  Transactions  are  accumulated  from  each  update  by  SSN.    The  transaction  file  is cumulative,  showing rejects, recycles, and processed transactions in  chronological  sequence for each member serviced by DJMS-AC. 5.9.1.1.  Each  update  will  display  transactions  in  chronological  sequence.    Transactions are  coded  as  E-Rejected,  F-Partial  Reject,  G-Processed,  J-Partial  Processed,   K-Processed  By  Others, L-Advance Transaction, and M-Recycle. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 189  5.9.1.2.  The transaction file does not include management notices. 5.9.1.3.  Rejected and recycled transactions contain the reason and/or error codes for the particular reject and/or recycle.  There can be up to six different codes for each reject or recycle.  There is no narrative description; only the code is displayed. 5.9.1.4.  Recycled  transactions  with  control  code  "M"  will  appear  only  once  on  the transaction file. It  will recycle until  it  has processed.  When it’s processed, it  will  show again. 5.9.1.5.  Advance transactions, control code "L" are treated like recycled transactions. 5.9.1.6.  Transactions  are  available  for  viewing  for  current  plus  four  years  before moving to history. 5.9.2.

The  Offline  Reporting  Control  System  provides  access  to  various  data  from the MMPA  via an  on-site  computer  terminal linked  to the  central  site  mainframe at DFAS-DE. Using Offline with its prompting screens (see Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2), the FSO can produce entitlement extracts as well as several formatted reports.  Information requested is transmitted to the  servicing  ADSN  for  printing.  New  releases  are  provided  to  update  Offline  software  and include all specific installation instructions necessary. 6.2.  Functions Performed.  The following products are available through the Offline Reporting Control System: 6.2.1.  Pay  Service  File  (PSF)/Gummed  Label  Prints  -  PSF  or  member  address information  is extracted  on an as-requested basis.   Both  the  PSF print and  gummed  labels are  produced  using  the  same file.  Data is in ORG, SSN or NAME sequence with sorting of the  information  performed  locally.  The  PSF  print  includes  a  total  page  with  the  number  of members assigned. 6.2.2.  Financial Organization/Payroll  Money List  - Extracted  twice  each  month,  sequenced by either SSN or financial organization name. 6.2.3.  Leave  Balance  Listing  -  Monthly,  leave  data  is  extracted  from  the  LES  data  base in name sequence within organization, as contained in the JLES file. 6.2.4.  ETS  Listing  -  Monthly,  Expiration  of  Term  of  Service  (ETS)  data  is  extracted  from the  LES  data  base  in  either  SSN,  Name,  Grade,  ETS  date  or  organization  sequence.  Contains information on members whose ETS will expire during the next calendar month.  It is to be used as a tool by the FSO and MPF to ensure that the member's pay is not interrupted due to an administrative oversight or that the member is not overpaid due to lost time.  The ETS listing  should be  checked against the DTR or the  MMPA  to  ensure  an  E5,  E4,  or  E6 or  TU04  (involuntary)  transaction  has  been  submitted  to  DFAS-DE.    If  appropriate transactions have been submitted, annotate the listing with the date the transactions appear on the DTR.  Contact the member's servicing MPF, separations and reenlistments section, in person or by telephone and request they process appropriate transactions to update the ETS or input the separation information. 6.2.5.  Pay  Record  Accessibility  (PRA)  Audit  Listing  -  PRA  information  is  extracted quarterly (March, June,  September, and December) and transmitted in SSN sequence.   See Chapter 1 for PRA procedures. 6.2.6.  Entitlement  Verification  -  Using  prompted  screen  formats,  information  on  any format ID is available for extract with the data base of all members assigned to the requesting ADSN as the source. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 243  6.2.7.  Family Quarters Verification – Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) data is extracted quarterly (Jan, Apr, July, and Oct)  from DJMS and compared to housing management data. The  results  of  this  comparison  is  posted  to  Report.Web  for  MAJCOM  retrieval  and distribution  to  their  bases  to  be  worked.    The  FSO  provides  applicable  reports  to  the housing office and ensure that all discrepancies are  worked.   FSO  notifies  MAJCOM  when the  report  has  been  worked.    See  Chapter  26  for  additional  procedures.    Working  the OFFLINE Family Quarters Verification report is no longer required. 6.2.8.  US  Savings  Bonds  Report  -  Extracted  on  an  as-requested  basis  sequenced  by  those members  with  and  those  without  bond  deductions.    Those  with  deductions  are  further broken  down  by  SSN within organization.  A subtotal is provided for each member who has more than one bond deduction. 6.2.9.  TD  Form  W-2s  5-Year  Tax  History  -  Information  on  TD  Forms  W-2  and  W-2c  is extracted on an as-requested basis. 6.2.10.  Miscellaneous  Reports  -  The  COLA  Members  Assigned  CONUS,  OHA  Members Assigned CONUS, and Members Receiving BAQ  with no VHA Reports are extracted after month-end  restructure,  with  a  message  on  the  JBTO  screen  when  the  data  has  been transmitted.  Data is in SSN sequence and available for 30 days. 6.2.11.  LES/NPA  Prints  -  LES  and  NPA  information  will  be  extracted  on  an  as-requested basis when the application is available. installed  on  an  IBM  PC  Compatible 6.3.  Operation.  The  Offline  system  must  be microcomputer with a microprocessor chip of the Intel 8086/88 variety; a 286 is acceptable but a 386  or  486  is  preferred  (examples  include  Zenith  248,  Sperry  PC/IT,  UNISYS  PW2,  and EVEREX  386).    Specific  information  about  installation,  start  up,  requirements  for  each application etc., are contained in the users guide included with offline releases. 6.4.  Data Communications: 6.4.1.  After  you  create  the  MILPAY  data  disk  from  the  Offline  system,  immediately  File Transfer  the  data  to  the  mainframe.    There  are  two  routines  used in  this  process.  The  first (JBTR)  is  used  only  for  those  functions  which  are  initiated  from  the  PC  (i.e.,  gummed labels/PSF  print,  Entitlement  Verification,  and  US  Savings  Bonds).    All  other  application code  subsystems  are  scheduled  to  extract  data  on  a  periodic  basis.  The  second  routine (JBTO) is used to extract output results from all application code requests. 6.4.2.  To  receive  your  MILPAY  Offline  files,  redirect to  your microcomputer's  hard drive.    There  are  two  types  of  communications  software  currently in use  - IRMAREMOTE and IRMACOMM.   The  redirect  steps  for  each are  contained in the Offline Reporting Control System users guide. transmission the 244 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 6.1.

Request To Receive And/Or Extend Repayment Of An Advance Housing Allowance  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 249  Chapter 7 PAYROLL AND PAY PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTION Section 7A—Payroll. 7.1.  Description.  Military  members  are  paid  on  a  monthly  basis  with  the  option  to  receive payments once or twice per month.  DFAS-DE pays all Air Force members.  Members receive a statement  of  net  pay  and  the  financial  organization  to  which  it  was  sent  at  mid-month  (if  receiving  a  payment)  and  a  comprehensive  statement  of  pay,  including  explanations  of  all elements of that pay, at end-of-month.  These statements are  created centrally  by DFAS-DE and mailed to the finance office or the mailing address on the member's pay statement. 7.2.  Payroll Processing: 7.2.1.  Local  Payees.    All  payroll  checks  for  local  payees  are  produced  and  mailed  from DFAS-DE.  Paychecks  will  be  mailed  in  sufficient  time  for  payees  to  receive  their paychecks  on  payday at  the address maintained on the JLES address file.  Addresses on the JLES  address  file  can  be  changed  by  using  the  JDC  SC04  transaction.    (See  Figure  7.13)  Only the servicing FSO or DFAS-DE can input an SC04 to update a member’s LES address. 7.2.2.  Central Payees.  Electronic Funds Transfer System (EFTS) payments are delivered to the Federal Reserve no later than 4 workdays prior to payday to ensure delivery to member accounts by pay- day.  Once released, payments cannot be stopped or returned to DFAS-DE. 7.3.  Non-receipt  of  Paycheck  -  Military  Pay  Actions.  Upon  notification  of  non-receipt  of  a paycheck, the military pay section contacts DFAS-JMSA/DE, via establishment of a CMS case, to  determine  if  the  check  was  returned  as  undeliverable.    If  DFAS-JMSA/DE  has  the  check, they will cancel the check and credit funds to the member's pay account.  If the check is lost or stolen,  complete DD  Form 2660, Statement  of  Claimant  Requisition  Recertified  Check,  have member  sign,  and  mail  to  DFAS-JMSA/DE.  Members  must  wait  seven  calendar  days  before submission of DD Form 2660.  If member was a pipeline student at the time of issuance of check, please annotate the FSO's Remark section as such.  Students will have immediate re-issuance of checks while other members must wait for U.S. Treasury response. 7.4.  Return of Funds - Military Pay Actions: 7.4.1.  When  funds are returned  from  either a  financial  organization (F.O.) or  from  the  post office, they will be returned (C1) to the member's pay account.  (See Figure 7.9). 7.4.2.  Members that have funds returned by a F.O. will also have their direct deposit stopped (LH02), unless a change has been processed (LH04). 7.5.  Suppression of  Payment.  When a  member's  pay is  suppressed, annotate  AF  Form 1121, Payment  Suppression  Register  (JUMPS)  accordingly.    (See  Figure  7.3)    Maintain  in accordance  with https://afrims.amc/af/mil.  Notify member whose pay has been  suppressed to minimize inquires on payday. 7.5.1.  Central  Payment.    Submission  of  input  transactions  (status  changes,  BAQ  stop) accomplishes required adjustment to the member's  MMPA and the central pay authorization file.   In  emergencies  a  message  or  telephone  call  may  be  required  to  suppress  a  central 250 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 payment.    Bases  must  contact  DFAS-DE/FJFBA  by  1400  hours  (Denver  time)  on  the payroll processing date. 7.5.2.  Local Payees.  When it is determined that a locally paid member should not receive a check, the servicing  FSO  must  process a  pay  suppression  (P103/P203 Figure 7.12) before cutoff.    The  base  level  input  of  a  P103/P203  goes  directly  into  a  recycle  file  until  payroll programs  are  executed  (immediately  after  the  appropriate  cut-off  update).  Then  they  are matched  against  the  pay  authorization  file.  If  the  P103/P203  finds  a  matching  pay authorization,  a  check  writing  record  is  not  produced  and  a  DJMS  pay  suppression  is created and  put into  the next DJMS update.  Therefore,  the MMPA  will  not reflect the pay suppression until the first update after cut-off.  Use P103/P203 to suppress pay for current or next month.  For permanent suppressions, use the ST04 (Figure 52.8) transaction.  If bases are not  able  to  process  P103/P203  before  cutoff,  they  should  contact  DFAS-DE/FJFBA  for  a check pull. FJFBA will cancel the paycheck into the member's MMPA for next pay period.  DFAS-DE/FJFBA must be notified 5 workdays before payday for check pulls. 7.6.  Even-Dollar  Payments.  FSOs  may  make  payments  in  even  dollars  in  overseas  areas  to reduce  use of  United  States  coins in these areas.   Payments  may also  be  made  in  even  dollars in the United States when specifically requested to alleviate coin shortages. 7.6.1.  Continuing  Payments.    If  even-dollar  payments  are  to  be  continued,  FSO  notifies DFAS-IN.  New pay authorizations in even dollars are issued to FSO.  If reported after EOM cut-off,  two  cycles  (MM  and  EOM)  are  required  to  obtain  new  pay  authorizations  which have  been  reduced  to  even  dollars.    Notification  may  be  made  by  airmail  letter,  courier, telegram  or  narrative  message.    Limited  use  of  telephone  calls  is  also  authorized  but  these must be confirmed in writing.  Include this data in the notification:  "ADSN (no.) must pay in even dollars beginning (date) and continuing indefinitely"; give reason that payment must be made in even dollars, date and signature. 7.6.2.  Stop  Even-Dollar  Payments.    When  no  longer  necessary  to  pay  in  even  dollars,  the FSO  notifies  DFAS-IN.    Include  this  data  in  the  notification:    "ADSN  (no.)  no  longer necessary to pay in even dollars effective (date)"; date; and signature.  Notification is by the same means as in 7.6.1 above. Section 7B—Pay Products. 7.7.  Leave  and  Earnings  Statement  (LES).  The  LES  is  a  comprehensive  statement  of  a member's leave  and earnings.    It  is issued upon accession,  final  separation, and the  end  of the month for which leave and earnings are accrued.  (See Figure 7.1)  The LES provides: 7.7.1.  The  most  current  pay,  taxes,  leave  and  status  information  available  in  the  member's MMPA when the LES was generated by DJMS (at end-of-month cutoff).  If a member has a SAVE  PAY  Leave  Balance,  the  balance  is  listed  in  the  remarks  area  of  the  June  and December LES. 7.7.2.  A statement of the member's pay and leave account. 7.7.3.  The  capability  for  supervisors  to  verify  members'  leave  balances  before  approving leave. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 251  7.7.4.  A  basis  for  the  FSO  to  use  when  answering  inquiries  and  authorizing  casual  and partial payments. 7.7.5.  Remarks information provided by HQ AFPC relating to the member’s retirement plan. 7.7.5.1.  Final  Pay  –  if  date  of  initial  entry  to  military/uniformed  service  (DIEMS)  is equal to or less than 7 Sep 1980. 7.7.5.2.  High 3 – If DIEMS is within the timeframe of 8 Sep 1980 through 31 July 1986. 7.7.5.3.  Choice – if DIEMS is greater than or equal to 1 August 1986. 7.8.  Net  Pay  Advice (NPA).  NPAs are issued to inform members of the amount of their mid-month  pay.  (See  Figure  7.2)    The  NPA  shows  members  the  amount  of  pay  received  at  mid-month along with the financial organization to which their check was sent.  Also included in the NPA  are  pay-related  remarks.  These  remarks  can  be  printed  on  all  NPAs  when  they  apply  to members in general or on NPAs of selected individuals when more specific in nature. 7.9.  TD Form  W-2,  Wage and Tax  Statement  and TD Form  W-2C, Corrected Wage and Tax  Statement.  W-2s  are  produced  by  DFAS-DE  and  are  either  forwarded  to  the  servicing ADSN  for  distribution  through  the  BITS  and  PSC  system  or  mailed  directly  to  the  member's home  address.  W-2c's  are  produced  at  DFAS-DE  and  mailed  directly  to  members'  home addresses.  Duplicate forms W-2 and W-2C are produced by central site and local FSO using the 5-Year Tax History System. 7.10.  Personal  Statement  of  Military  Compensation  (PSMC).  The  PSMC  is  a  statement produced annually which outlines the total value of members' military pay and benefits. PSMCs are sorted and mailed to the member’s mailing address contained in JLES. Requests for duplicate PSMCs  must  be  sent  to  MAJCOM  for  forwarding  to  DFAS  who  will  request  creation  of  the duplicate. The request must include the member's name, SSN, the calendar year of the statement requested (i.e., 2007).  Statements cannot be re-issued prior to 2005; information for earlier years must  be  obtained  from  members'  LES and/or TD Form W-2  for the applicable  year.   Requests typically  take  one  to  two  weeks  to  complete.    Once  complete,  the  form  will  be  emailed  to  the requestor via the finance office. 7.11.  LES Production: 7.11.1.  End-of-Month LESs.    After  EOM  cutoff,  production  of the LESs  begins at  DFAS-DE.    LESs  are  mailed  to  the  base,  home  address  and  to  Geographically  Separated  Units (GSUs) depending on the JLES address file.  (See paragraph 7.18). 7.11.2.  Accession  LESs.  LESs are  generated upon  the accession of basic  military trainees.  Printing  of the accession  LES  is  not  done until  EOM  cutoff,  so that all LESs are produced at one time.  (See Chapter 39 for Accession information.) 7.11.3.  Separation  LESs.    Separation  LESs  are  generated  upon  the  member's  separation.  Printing of the separation LES is not done until EOM cutoff, so that all LESs are produced at one time during the month.  Once members are placed in "T" status LES information will be recycled until they enter "V" status.  Upon being placed in "V" status, a member's LES will be produced at the next monthly production.  (See Chapter 52 for separation information.) 252 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 7.11.4.  Members in  PCS  Status.  When the  member is  departing PCS,  the servicing  ADSN processes an  SH  transaction to  place the  member  in PCS  status.  Inform the  member  of  the options available for LES delivery during PCS.  For those members who wish to receive their LESs  during  this  period,  process  an  SC04  with  an  "A"  in  the  LES-NPA-PRINT-IND.   (See Figure 7.13)  Options include: 7.11.4.1.  Forward member's LES to leave address; 7.11.4.2.  Forward to member's gaining FSO; 7.11.4.3.  Forward to sponsor's address if sponsor agrees; 7.11.4.4.  Retain at DFAS-DE  until the  member arrives  at  the  gaining  station  and  SG  is processed.  Upon  processing  of  the  SG,  the  LES  is  produced  and  mailed  with  the  next month's production; or 7.11.4.5.  Forward to any other address specified by the member. 7.11.5.  Members  Who  Are TDY.  If a  member  is TDY  for an  extended period of time, the TDY  station  FSO  can  process  an  LD01  or  LD04  transaction.    The  LD01  or  LD04 transaction  will cause the member's LES to be routed to the TDY ADSN.  Once an LD02 is processed, DFAS-DE will revert to sending the LES to the permanent ADSN. 7.11.6.  Members  assigned  to  GSUs.    If  a  member  is  assigned  to  a  GSU,  the  servicing ADSN  may request DFAS-DE mail the LESs to the GSU instead  of  mailing the  statements to the servicing base who then forwards the LESs to the GSU.  An SC04 transaction should be  processed  and  a  "B"  placed  in  the  LES/NPA-PRT-ID  field.    (See  paragraph  7.18) DFAS-DE/FJY  must  be  notified  and  coordinated  with  before  GSU  changes  are  initiated.  (See Figure 7.13.) 7.11.7.  Members  Separating  or  Retiring.    Members  who  are  separating  or  retiring  will have their LESs mailed to a designated address upon entering "V" status.  The LF transaction provides  the  future  mailing address  where  the  member's  final  LES  will  be  mailed.    Ensure addresses  contained  in  the  LF  entry  are  postal  addresses.    Members  who  are  on  terminal leave may elect to have their LESs mailed to  their  home address.   The  servicing  FSO  must input an SC04 transaction to update the  member's JLES address file.  (See paragraph 7.18 for mailing options.) 7.12.  NPA Production: 7.12.1.  Mid-Month.  At mid-month cutoff, DFAS-DE starts producing NPAs which are then mailed  to  the  ADSN  or  the  member.    The  NPA  is  issued  at  mid-month  for  twice-a-month payees.    NPAs  will  be  produced  for  once-a-month  payees  when  remarks  require  it.  Normally,  a  message  will  be  sent  to  the  field  indicating  NPAs  were  produced  for  once-a-month payees. 7.12.2.  Members in a TDY/PCS Status.  If a member is in a TDY status, DFAS-DE will send the NPA to the servicing ADSN unless an LD01 or LD04 transaction is processed.  When an LD01 or LD04 is processed, the NPA will be sent to the TDY ADSN.  If a member is in PCS status, the servicing ADSN processes the  SH transaction to update the MMPA accordingly.  The member's NPA(s) will be recycled until the MMPA is updated with the new ADSN (SG and SC04 transactions).   Upon input of the  SC04  and  SG  transactions,  the  members'  NPAs will be produced and mailed with the next monthly production. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 253  7.13.  SC04  Transaction  (JDC  II  and  JDC  III).  This  transaction  is  used  to  update  data  on the  JLES  address  file at DFAS-DE and  can  only  be input  by the  servicing FSO  or DFAS-DE. The  data  on the JLES address  file  is  used  to  distribute  LESs,  NPAs,  W-2s  and  PSMCs.   (See Figure 7.13  for  SC04  format.) DFAS-DE  creates a  quarterly  management notice report that  is titled  "Inaccurate  Delivery  Addresses  Requiring  Research  and  Correction"  PCN UH099C0311.    This  report  is  created  on  a  quarterly  basis  and  reflects  addresses  that  have failed  the  bump  against  the  address  file  called  "FINALIST."    This  file,  maintained  at DFAS-DE, is certified by the United States Postal Service and is a commercially developed database for zip  codes and addresses.  During  the  bump  process, the  members' addresses (JLES, bonds, and allotments)  will  be  checked  for  accuracy,  and  whenever  possible,  an  SC04  or  AA04  will  be systematically  generated to  place  the correct  version  of the address  on the MMPA or the JLES file.  For addresses that "FINALIST" finds unacceptable, the above report will be created.   The report  will  identify  which  address  needs  to  be  corrected  by  noting  the  type  as  "JL"  for  JLES, "AB" for bonds, etc.  The report will be personalized for each ADSN/DSSN.  The time frame for corrections  before  the  next  bump  will  be  approximately  70  calendar  days  to  contact  the member,  obtain a precise address, and  input a  more  accurate address. 7.14.  myPay. 7.14.1.  General.    In  January  2001,  the  Defense  Joint  Military  Pay  System  (DJMS) implemented  myPay,  allowing  members  to  update  certain  pay  information  by  accessing the    pay  system  via  the  internet.    Screen  menus  guide  members  through  desired transactions  once  the  system  has  been  accessed.    After  changes  have  been  made,  the system  asks  the  member  to  confirm  the  action  and  advises  the  member  when  the  change will be reflected on the pay record.  Using a personal identification number (PIN), members are able to: 7.14.1.1.  View, print, and save leave and earnings statements (LES) 7.14.1.2.  View, print and save tax statements 7.14.1.3.  Change Federal and State tax withholdings 7.14.1.4.  Update bank account and electronic fund transfer information 7.14.1.5.  Make address changes 7.14.1.6.  View,  print,  and  save  travel  vouchers  –  currently,  LeaveWeb  does  not  feed information  to  myPay,  so  it  is  not  available  to  Air  Force,  but  the  capability  exists  in myPay. 7.14.1.7.  Control Thrift Savings Plan enrollment 7.14.1.8.  View, print, and save retiree account statement 7.14.1.9.  View, print and save annuitant account statement 7.14.1.10.  Annuitants  are  able  to  provide  report  of  existence  and  update  certificate  of eligibility 7.14.1.11.  Turn off hard-copy LES – mandatory for AF members 7.14.1.12.  Turn off hard-copy W-2 tax statements – mandatory for AF members 254 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 7.14.1.13.  Change personal identification number (PIN) 7.14.1.14.  View 12 months of LES data 7.14.1.15.  Start,  stop  and  change  financial  allotments.    Allotments  can  only  be established  to  financial institutions.    Insurance and bond allotments are  not available at this time, but should be in the future. 7.14.1.16.  Establish  a  restricted  access  personal  identification  number.    This  allows members  to provide  a  spouse  or  trusted  individual  with  a  view-only  PIN.   For  more information  on  the  restricted  access  PIN,  see  subparagraph  7.14.3  (obtaining  a  PIN) below. 7.14.1.17.  Establish  a  personal  e-mail  address  for  future  correspondence.  The  e-mail address will be used to keep members apprised of future events and capabilities, such as e-mail notification of pay changes and other items of interest.  Members can provide the e-mail address by setting up the "personal settings" page. 7.14.2.  FSO  Responsibilities.    When  a  member  makes  a  change  to  his/her  financial information  via  myPay,  a  transaction  is  created  in  DJMS  to  update  the  member’s  record. These  transactions  will  have  an  input  source  of  3848  and  those  that  process  will  appear  in section 6 of the servicing FSO’s DTR as well as the DTR for 3848. 7.14.2.1.  Rejected  myPay  transactions  are  reflected  in  the  E/MSS  Daily  Transaction Report, PCN:  UH099CA12, Section II, via the FACA03D report  in  SAR, and  must be resolved  by  the  servicing  FSO.  Contact  the  member  and  determine  what  the  member wanted to accomplish and reinput the transaction to update the pay record accordingly. 7.14.2.2.  When  processing  the  SC04  transaction  to  change  a  member’s  address  (most  often  at  PCS  arrival,  but  whenever  an  SC04  is  processed),  ensure  that  character position  23  contains  an  "N"  to  ensure  the  myPay  electronic  pay  statements  remain  in place rather than allowing hard copy pay statements to be turned back on. 7.14.3.  Obtaining  a  PIN.    To  obtain  a  PIN,  the  member  selects  "new  PIN"  under  the "Need a new PIN?" title in the lower section of the myPay home page.  The member will be prompted to enter SSN and  then receive instructions based  on  the  information available  for that  specific  member.   In  most cases,  the  PIN  will  be  mailed  to  the  member’s  address  of record  or  e-mailed  to  a  pre-registered  address.    Additional  instructions  are  available within  myPay.    Restricted  access  PINs  (see  item  16  above)  are  obtained  and  used  as follows: 7.14.3.1.  The restricted PIN can be set by signing into myPay and from the main menu, clicking  on  the  "Personal  Settings"  page.    Member  must  click  the  "Restricted  Access PIN"  to  create  and  input  the  restricted  access  PIN  and  provide  it  to  the  spouse/family member/trusted individual. 7.14.3.2.  For the  spouse/family member to use  the restricted access  PIN, the individual signs  into  myPay  with  the  member’s  SSN  under  "LOGINID"  and  then  enters  the restricted access PIN provided by the member.  With the restricted access PIN, the spouse or family member can view and print the LES and W2 but cannot make pay changes. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 255  7.14.3.3.  An  ‘alias’  LOGIN-ID  is  now  available,  allowing  a  member  to  establish  a unique  LOGIN-ID  other  than  his/her  SSN,  which  can  be  used,  along  with  the  PIN,  to access  myPay.  This  LOGIN-ID  must  be  6-8  alpha/numeric  characters  with  no  special characters  or  spaces.   If  a  customer establishes a LOGIN-ID, the  SSN  can no longer  be used  to  access  the  myPay  account.  The  link  to  establish  a  LOGIN-ID  ‘alias’  is  on  the personal settings page. 7.14.4.  Turning  off  hard  copy  LES.    Delivery  of  an  electronic  LES  eliminates  risks associated  with receiving  financial information  in the  mail.  To turn  off hard  copy  LES, the member must click on the "turn off hard copy" button on the LES screen. 7.14.5.  Customer  Support.    Help  with  the  myPay  applications  is  available  online  at  HTTP://WWW.DFAS.MIL/MYPAY/MYPAYFEEDBACK.HTM. customer support  number  is 1-800-390-2348, Monday through Friday between 7 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. EST.

During  EOM  processing  every  month  copies  of  all member LESs  are  created  and  stored  on  this  file.   This  includes  normal  end-of-month  and separation  LESs.  End-of-month  LESs  are  easily  distinguished  by  the  98  in  the   day-of-the  month  field  (example  930898).  A  separation  LES  will  contain  numbers  01-25 in  the  day  field  (example  930813).    History  LESs  for  the  most  recent  13  months  are maintained  on  this  file.  LESs  older  than  13  months  are  moved  to  the  JLES-Archive  Print System. (NOTE:  only the first 10 months are visible to the user; pressing PF8 will take the user to the next screen.) 7.21.2.  JLES-Address  Display  System.    This  file  contains  the  mailing  address  of  all members.    The  SC04  and  LG04  transactions  update  member  addresses.    (Reference Figure 7.13 and paragraph 7.13.2.) 7.21.3.  JLES-Remark  Display  System.    This  file  contains  the  remarks  used  on  the  LES.  FSOs  can  view  this  file,  while  update  access  is  restricted  to  DFAS-DE.    The  remarks contained  on  this  file  are  the  remarks  generated  by  DJMS  and  are  NOT  the  same  as  the remarks covered in paragraph 7.8. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 257  7.21.4.  JLES-Archive  Print  System.    Archive  prints  of  past  LESs  may  be  obtained through this option.  LESs as far back as October 1992 may be obtained from this file.  Prints of this  file  will  go to the  printer  that  receives  the  JLES  History  prints.   If  your  base  does not receive the requested LES prints, contact DFAS-DE/FJGC. 7.22.  Offline  Reporting  System.  The  Offline  Reporting  System  has  replaced  most  of  the products received from the old base level system.  Reference Chapter 6 for specific applications that are available. All of the information used in the Offline Reporting system is extracted from the JLES system. Figure 7.1.

Description.  Basic  pay  is  established  on  a  member's  MMPA  based  on  event-oriented transactions  covered  in  other  chapters.    Individuals  holding  certain  positions  are  entitled  to rates  of  basic  pay  other  than  that  for  their  grade  and  longevity.    See  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A, chapter 1. 8.2.  Source  of  Input.  Basic  Pay  is  started,  stopped  or  changed  based  on  event-oriented transactions  received  from  AFPC.  Processed  transactions  will  appear  as  FID  01  on  the  DTL, section 6. 8.3.  Rate.  Initial rate of basic pay is established based on grade and years of creditable service completed at the time the individual is accessed to the Air Force.  The rate is adjusted or stopped by other events such as: 8.3.1.  Promotion or demotion 8.3.2.  Completion of additional years of creditable service (longevity) 8.3.3.  Non-pay status conditions (AWOL, desertion, excess leave, etc.) 8.3.4.  Basic pay rate changes authorized by Congress 8.3.5.  Separation 8.3.6.  Correction of service dates from MPF 8.3.7.  Assignment to designated positions 8.4.  Additional  Compensation  for  Designated  Positions.  Individuals  serving the following  positions  may  be  authorized  special  rates  of  basic  pay  in  accordance  with  the DoDFMR.   They  may also  be authorized  Personal  Money  Allowance in addition  to  the  special Basic Pay Rate.  (See Chapter 34.) in 8.4.1.  Chief of Staff 8.4.2.

See  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapters  01  through  21,  for  conditions  of entitlement  to  special  pays.  Processed  transactions  start,  change,  correct  or  cancel  the entitlement  and  update  the  MMPA.    Once  established,  computer  programming  adjusts payment  amounts  based  on  years  of  service  completed  without  additional  input.    For information on SAVE PAY, see Chapter 75 of this volume. 9.2.  Payment.  Input  establishes  necessary  entries  to  generate  payment  authorization.    FSO makes payments as outlined in Chapter 37 of this volume. 9.3.  Recoupment.  In the event the individual separates before completion of service outlined in the contract, the unearned portion is recouped per the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 5, 6 or 21. For all special pay, except for recoupment of medical officer bonuses, DJMS will automatically calculate  the  amount  of  recoupment  required  based  on  the  separation  designator  furnished  by AFPC. 9.4.  Effect  on  MMPA.  Processed transactions  will appear  in  section 6 of the  servicing  FSO's DTR for all medical  special  pays except optometry  pay,  which appears in  section 4.   Any FSO may make and report these payments if the pay authorization is present on the MMPA, provided evidence exists to attest to the fact the payment was not made by another FSO. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 273  Chapter 10 SPECIAL PAY FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL OFFICERS AND NURSES 10.1.

Processed  transactions  start,  change,  correct,  or  cancel  the  entitlements  and  update  the MMPA for pay computation.  When a physician/dentist reaches the necessary years that require an adjustment in pay for VSP or BCP, computer programming adjusts the pay without any external input.  For conditions and computation of SAVE PAY, see Chapter 75. 10.3.  Variable  Special  Pay  (VSP).  Payable to physicians/dentists  based  on training  status and years of creditable medical service.  MMPA shows VSP as FID 24 for physicians and FID 20 for dentists. 10.4.  Board  Certification  Pay  (BCP).  Payable  to  physicians/dentists  who  are  board  certified. Officers must be established as physicians/dentists before the BCP is entered on their MMPAs.  If the FID 19 (BCP) is received before FID's 24 or 20 (VSP), the BCP will recycle at 7-day intervals for  49  days.  If  a  physician/dentist  reaches  the  applicable  years  of  medical/dental  service  or certification expiration date, the rate is increased or discontinued programmatically. 10.5.  Additional Special Pay (ASP).  Payable to physicians/dentists who are not in internship or initial  residency  training  and  sign  a  written  agreement  to  remain  on  active  duty  for  a  period  of  1 year from the contract effective date.  A processed transaction will place this entitlement on the MMPA, create an R2 entry showing the effective date, and generate a PJ payment authorization. Payment  is  made  annually  in  advance  as  a  lump  sum  and  shown  on  the  MMPA  as  FID  25. Continuation  Pay  for  dental  officers  is  payable  to  dentists  who  qualify  under  the  saved  pay provisions  of  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  6,  at  the  rates  prescribed.  It  is  shown  on  the MMPA as FID 25. 10.6.  Incentive  Special  Pay (ISP).  Congress revised the ISP program effective 1 January 1991 so that eligible physicians may sign multi-year contracts (1, 2, 3, or 4 years).  The initial payment is paid upon execution of the contract, and subsequent installments are made on the anniversary date of the contract.  A processed transaction will place the entitlement on the MMPA as FID 25, create an RC bonus entry, and generate a PJ payment authorization. 10.7.  Optometry  Pay.  Payable  monthly  to  optometrists  on  active  duty  for  a  period  of  at  least  1 year.  Shown on the MMPA as FID 29. 10.8.  Multi-Year Special Pay (MSP).  Payable to eligible physicians below the grade of 07, with at least 8 years' creditable service or who have completed all active duty service  obligation, who will have completed initial residency training or will complete such training before September 30th of the fiscal year in which the officer enters into an MSP agreement, and are fully qualified in a designated  specialty.  Officers  must  execute a  written agreement to remain  on active  duty  for at least 2 years but no more than 4 years after completion of any active duty service commitment for medical  education or  training.  MSP contracts will be payable in  equal  annual installments.  The initial annual installment will be paid upon execution of the MSP service agreement.  Payments of subsequent  installment  amounts  will  be  made  on  the  anniversary  date  of  the  agreement.  A processed transaction will place the entitlement on the MMPA as FID 25, create an RB entry, and generate a PJ payment authorization. 10.9.  Incentive  Special  Pay  for  Certified  Registered  Nurse  Anesthetists  (CRNA).  A nurse corps officer  who is qualified and performing as a CRNA may be paid incentive special pay for each year of a properly executed written agreement to serve on active duty at a rate prescribed in the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  21.  The  officer  must  agree  to  remain  on  active  duty  for  a 276 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 period of not less than one year.  The effective date of the agreement shall be prescribed in Military Department regulations issued by the Secretary concerned and shall be included in the agreement. Subject  to  mutual  acceptance,  an  officer  may  execute  a  two  year  agreement.  Under  such agreements,  payments  shall  be  made  at  the  beginning  of  the  agreement  and  on  the  one  year anniversary  date.  A  processed  transaction  will  place  the  entitlement  on  the  MMPA  as  FID  25, create an RD entry, and generate a PJ payment authorization. 10.10.  Dental Multiyear Retention Bonus.  A dental officer, who executes a written agreement which is accepted by the secretary of the military department concerned, may be paid a retention bonus per eligibility criteria and rates payable as prescribed in DoDFMR, Vol 7A, chapter 6. 10.11.  Nurse Accession Bonuses. 10.11.1.  Registered  Nurse  Accession  Bonus.  A  nurse  who  qualifies  for  appointment  as  a nurse  corps  officer  and  executes  a  written  agreement  to  accept  a  commission  and  serve  on active  duty  as  a  nurse  corps  officer  for  a  period  of  not  less  than  four  years,  may,  upon acceptance of the agreement by the Secretary concerned, be paid a lump sum accession bonus at  a  rate  prescribed  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  21.  A  personnel  generated transaction  will  place  the  entitlement  on  the  MMPA  as  FID  26,  create  an  RE  entry,  and generate a PJ payment authorization. 10.11.2.  Dental Officer Accession Bonus.  A dental officer who executes a written agreement to accept a commission as an officer of the Air Force designated as a dental officer, to serve on active duty for a period of not less than four years, and upon acceptance of the agreement of the  service  Secretary,  is  entitled  to  dental  officer  accession  bonus.  The  individual  must  not have received financial assistance from the Department of Defense  for this specialty prior to appointment  as  a  dental  officer.  Policy  for  this  entitlement  is  contained  in  the  DoDFMR, Volume  7A,  chapter  6.  A  personnel  generated  transaction  will  place  the  entitlement  on  the MMPA as FID 26, create an RE entry, and generate a PJ payment authorization.  (Reference figure 10-6.) 10.12.  Payment of Bonus.  For central payees, the installments of any of the bonuses discussed in  this  chapter  are  released  from  the  DFAS  Central  Site  through  the  electronic  funds  transfer system (EFTS) on the effective dates.  Local payees are paid via the one-time pay authorization list at base level.  When a member is paid by EFTS, base level is notified by message on the one-time pay authorization list, instead of receiving a pay authorization to make payment locally.  Members in a TDY or PCS status, who are central payees, will receive their installments by EFTS.  Locally paid  members,  who  are  TDY,  may  receive  those  payments  from  the  TDY  FSO.  Locally  paid members,  who  are  in  PCS  status  may  be  paid  the  installments  by  any  FSO  since  no  pay authorization will be issued.  In this case, gaining FSOs should determine if the payment was made by another FSO before routinely issuing a bonus payment. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 277  Figure 10.1.

Description.  Special  Duty  Assignment  Pay  (SDAP)  is  authorized  to  entitled  members proficient  in  an  Air  Force  designated  military  skill  or  assigned  duties  demanding  an  unusual degree of responsibility. See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 8, for entitlement conditions. 11.2.  Source  of  Input.  Member's  servicing  Military  Personnel  Flight  (MPF)  submits SDAP  data to DFAS-DE.  SDAP is shown on the MMPA as FID 30. 11.2.1.  DJMS  generates  and  processes  future  transactions  to  stop  terminated  special  duty assignment rates.  No input or manual intervention is required. 11.2.2.  Processed transactions appear in section 6 of servicing FSO's DTR (Chapter 2). 11.2.3.  Due  to  the  brownout  of  DJMS-AC,  JDC/DMO  has  not  been  changed  to  accept  all SDAP  proficiency  pay  type  codes  currently  in  use.    Those  codes  that  JDC/DMO  will  not accept are indicated in  paragraph 11.3.2  below.  If a pro pay type  code is annotated as not in JDC/DMO, the  workaround is  for  HQ  AFPC  to  send  a  spreadsheet  or  case  management system  (CMS)  case  to  DFAS-PMJ/DE  for  manual  input.    PMJ  uses  one  of  the  acceptable pro  pay  type  codes  (see  table  41  in  JWMM)  and  the  correct  rate  code  from  table  11  in JWMM to get the  input accomplished.    (NOTE:    Effective  1 October  2003,  the  Air  Force eliminated  several  rate  codes;  and  now  uses  only  SD-1  through  6  for  current  processing.)  Once  that  is  done,  the  specialty  type  code  is  changed  to  the  correct  one.    This  does  not cause a problem  with  the  dollar amount  paid  to  the  member,  but  can  cause a  delay in the member receiving the SDAP. 11.2.4.  In  most  cases,  members  entitled to and receiving  career  enlisted  flyer incentive pay (CEFIP)  are  not  entitled  to  SDAP  after  February  2003.    CEFIP  is  identified  by  a  FID  12 entry on the MMPA, with crew status equal to 6. 11.3.  SDAP Rates and Authorized Codes: 11.3.1.  Rate codes: Rate Code Amount 1 2 3 4 5 6 See JWMM, Table 11 See JWMM, Table 11 See JWMM, Table 11 See JWMM, Table 11 See JWMM, Table 11 See JWMM, Table 11  NOTE:  The rates are not included in the chapter to prevent these rates from differing from the actual rates paid to members.  The table is kept up to date and should be the source for this information. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 291    11.3.2.

Description.  Enlistment  or  reenlistment  bonuses  may  be  authorized  enlisted  members who  meet  certain  conditions  set  forth  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  and  the  DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 9. 12.2.  Source of Input: 12.2.1.  Initial  Enlistment  Bonus  (SEB).   MPF  determines  initial  entitlement  to  IEB  when member  completes  authorized  training  and  is  awarded  the  applicable  Air  Force  specialty code  (AFSC).    MPF  may  cancel  IEB  if  appropriate,  by  establishing  a  CMS  case  and referring it to the proper box at DFAS-DE. 12.2.2.  (DELETED) 12.2.3.  (DELETED) Section 12B—Reenlistment Bonus 12.3.  Source of Input: 12.3.1.  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  (SRB).  MPF  determines  initial  entitlement  to  SRB when  member  separates  with  immediate  reentry,  shows  SRB  multiplier,  and  indicates  lump-sum  or  installment  payment  in  the  separation/reenlistment  input.   DFAS-DE computer  programs  compute  amount  payable  for  both  the  initial  payment  and  annual installments. 12.3.2.  Accelerated  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus.    If  a  member's  selective  reenlistment bonus  is  set  up  for  installment  payments,  early  payment  of  unpaid  balance  or  an installment  may  be authorized under AFI 36-2606.  AFPC submits input to pay accelerated payment. 12.3.3.  Broken  Service  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  (BSSRB).    BSSRB  is  paid  to members  who have a break in  service  of  more  than 3  months  but  not  more than 4 years  in certain  critical  AFSCs.  This  bonus  is  based  on  the  member's  basic  pay  at  the  time  of separation from service.  MPF inputs an EC03 transaction to DFAS-DE to have the BSSRB posted to the member's MMPA.  Since research is required to determine the  member's basic pay  at  the  time  of  separation,  DFAS-DE  will  establish  an  ACCS  case  on  receipt  of  the EC03.  BSSRB is due the member 90 days after arrival at the first PDS. 12.3.4.  Selective Reenlistment, BSSRB Bonuses Unpaid at Separation.  Special input is not required for payment of balance of SRB unpaid at separation.  Separation program determines right to payment based on reason for separation.  When unpaid SRB is payable, amount due is included in amount specified in separation pay authorization. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 295  12.4.  DFAS-DE Output: 12.4.1.  SRB Installments.  If the member is a central payee, then the anniversary payment is released  on  the  effective  date  through  electronic  funds  transfer  system  (EFTS)  from  the DFAS  Central  Site  for  the  amount  of  installment,  less  tax  if  applicable.  For  local  payees, DFAS-DE  furnishes  the  FSO  a  pay  authorization  for  the  amount  of  installment,  less  tax  if applicable,  for  payment  on  the  effective  date.  If  member  has  lost  time  since  last  SRB installment was paid, effective date of pay authorization shows deferment of that installment by number of days lost. 12.4.2.  Accelerated  SRB.    Request  for  accelerated  SRB  payment  generates  an  EFTS payment  from DFAS  for  central payees or a pay authorization to the  FSO for  local  payees. The  EFTS  payment  or  the  pay  authorization  to  the  FSO  is  an  amount  less  applicable  tax deductions as computed from the data in MMPA. 12.5.  FSO Action on DFAS-DE Output: 12.5.1.  Separation/Reenlistment  Output.  Required  actions  in  connection  with  DFAS-DE output from separation/reenlistment transactions are in Chapter 53. 12.5.2.  Later Bonus Pay Authorizations: 12.5.2.1.  Payment.  For local payees, when FSO receives a pay authorization for an SRB installment,  or  accelerated  SRB,  pay  member  amount  shown  in  pay  authorization.  Do not make payment before effective date shown in pay authorization. 12.5.2.2.  Report of Payment.  Report payment to DFAS-DE as shown in Chapter 53. 296 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 13 HOSTILE FIRE (HFP) AND IMMINENT DANGER PAY (IDP) 13.1.  Description.  Members  permanently  assigned,  PCS,  or  TDY  in  areas  designated  in  the DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  10,  and  meeting  the  conditions  of  entitlement  outlined  in  that chapter, are entitled to imminent danger pay (IDP).   Members in a non-designated area who are involved in a hostile fire pay incident can receive hostile fire pay (HFP).  Members can be paid either HFP or IDP, but not both in the same month. 13.2.  Source  of  Input.  The  FSO  is  the  source  of  input  for  entitlement  to  either  HFP  or  IDP.  FID  23  is  used  with  qualifiers  indicating  whether  the  entitlement  is  to  HFP  or  IDP  and  under what conditions. 13.2.1.  2301 (IDP start)  establishes  entitlement  for an indefinite period.   Creates open FID 23  and  FID  BS.    An  open  FID  FL  is  created  if  HFP-IDP-QUALFR  is  2,  4,  or  6.  COUNTRY-CODE  and  period  of  entitlement  verified  by  on-line  table  054,  IDP  Countries.  (See Figure 13.1.) 13.2.2.  2302  (IDP  stop)  terminates  entitlement  to  IDP  if  member  becomes  ineligible. * (See Figure 13.1.) 13.2.3.  2303  (HFP  or  IDP  report)  credits  member  with  a  one-time  entitlement  to  HFP  or IDP and is used only with inclusive dates.*  (See Figure 13.2.) 13.2.4.  2305  (HFP  or  IDP  correct)  corrects  an  error (See Figure 13.3.) in  a  previous transaction.  13.2.5.  2306 (HFP or IDP cancel) cancels entitlement to HFP or IDP previously submitted. (See Figure 13.2) NOTE:  *If a 2302 or 2303 transaction is received with a stop date in the current  processing  month, the transaction  will appear  in  section 8  of  the  DTR and  process on the first calendar day of the following month. 13.3.  Substantiating  Documents.  Unit  or  Air  Crew  Commanders  must  authorize  these entitlements, based  on knowledge of a  specific incident in a non-designated area or knowledge of  a  member’s  duty  in  a  designated  area.    Do  not  include  or  attach  classified  or  sensitive information to the substantiating or supporting document. 13.3.1.  HFP  should  be  reported  on  an  AF  Form  1881,  Hostile  Fire  Pay  Certification  and MPO.  When an AF Form 1881 is not available, DD Form 114, Military Pay Order, may be substituted, if it includes all pertinent information contained on the AF Form 1881 including: SSN, name, grade, organization, DoDFMR, Volume 7A Qualifying Rule, qualified inclusive period  (From/To),  description,  location,  time  and  date  of  incident,  and  certifying  official’s name, position, grade, signature and date. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 297  13.3.2.  IDP  can be reported on an AF Form 1881 or published  orders that reference  a duty location in a designated area (per:  DoDFMR Volume 7A, figure 10-1) and DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-voucher, for determining the inclusive period of entitlement.  However, published orders that do not include an itinerary or state a designated area are not adequate. 13.3.2.1.  Members are entitled to receive IDP during the period of duty in the designated location.  When the member provides his/her orders (DD Form 1610 or DTS authorization showing an assigned six digit authorization number), use them, along with a certified DD Form  114,  to  start  the  entitlement  effective  the  date  the  member  is  due  to  arrive  in  the designated area. If only group orders are available, verify with personnel readiness that the member actually departed prior to starting the entitlement. 13.3.2.2.  Members  who return  from  designated locations  lose  entitlement  to IDP at the end of the month of departure from that location.  If the member returns to the PDS and does not have a copy of the travel voucher (i.e., filed with another organization), have the member create another voucher, including signature.  That provides member certification of the facts.  Submit the voucher to stop the entitlement.  Advise the member to provide you  a  copy  of  the  settled  travel  voucher,  upon  receipt,  for  use  in  verifying  the  dates  as posted to the MMPA to ensure there was no over or underpayment. 13.3.3.  For contingency operations or major deployments, the Joint Chiefs of Staff will issue processing procedures for starting IDP and other entitlements. 13.3.4.  Members  performing  duty  at  Guantanamo  Bay  may  be  entitled  to  IDP  if  they  are certified  as  performing  qualifying  duty  “behind  the  wire”.  The  certification  memo  and/or email from AFAFO are used as substantiating documentation for the entitlement. 13.3.5.  For  members receiving IDP and  hardship  duty pay – location  (HDP-L),  the  total  of these  two  pays  is  limited  to  $325  per  month;  therefore,  regardless  of  the  HDP-L  amount designated for the area, the HDP-L in those cases is not to exceed $100 per month. 13.4.  HFP  or  IDP  Qualifiers.  Areas  authorized  HFP/IDP  are  identified  in  Table  10-1  of  the DoDFMR, Volume 7A.   Areas authorized CZTE are identified  in  chapter  44 of the DoDFMR, Volume 7A.  Figure 13.4  provides applicable HFP or IDP entitlement  codes with and without combat  zone tax exclusion (CZTE). 13.5.  CZTE  Withholding  Election.  The  CZ-DEDTN  field  will  contain  0  when  CZTE  is  not authorized. See Chapter 56 for information when CZTE is authorized. 13.6.  Proration  of  HFP  or  IDP  Entitlement.  If  the  HFP  OR  IDP  is  effective  in  the  same month as the member's accession or separation, or if the member is subject to a total forfeiture, or is on excess leave for part of the month, the entitlement will be prorated. 13.7.  HFP or IDP and CZTE.  See Chapter 56 for information on CZTE. 13.8.  Effect of Leave on IDP Entitlement.  The following examples illustrate periods of leave and HFP OR IDP entitlement.

Combat-Related  Injury  Rehabilitation  Pay  (CIP).  CIP  was  replaced  by  the  Pay  and Allowance  Continuation  (PAC)  program,  effective  15  May  2008.    Eligible  members  received CIP through 31 May 08, with PAC  beginning 1 June 08.   PAC  entitles  the member to  continue receipt  of  all  pays  and  allowances  received  prior  to  hospitalization.    See  paragraph  13.11 below  for  information  on  PAC.    The  information  contained  in  paragraph  13.10  and  its subparagraphs  is  provided  for  historical  purposes.    CIP  was  a  special  pay  for  members  who, while in the line of duty, incurred a wound, injury, or illness in a combat operation or designated combat  zone  and  were  evacuated  from  the  combat  operation  or  zone  for  medical  treatment. Military members were considered hospitalized for the purposes of CIP if admitted as an inpatient in a military treatment facility or, for the purposes of receiving extensive outpatient rehabilitation or  other  medical  care  in  a  military  treatment  facility,  in  residence  in  quarters  affiliated  with the military health care system. 13.10.1.  Entitlement.  A member who was evacuated from the theater for medical treatment was  entitled  to  CIP  for  each  month  the  member  was  hospitalized  for  treatment  of  such wounds,  injuries  or  illness,  subject  to  the  entitlement  start  and  stop  dates  as  described  in paragraph  13.10.3  and  13.10.4  below.  Military  members  were  considered  hospitalized  for the  purposes  of  CIP  if  admitted  as  an  inpatient  in  a  military  treatment  facility  or,  for  the purposes of receiving  extensive  outpatient rehabilitation or  other  medical  care  in  a  military treatment  facility,  in  residence  in  quarters  affiliated  with  the  military  health  care  system.  Such wound, injury, or illness was considered "in the line of duty" unless it was the result of the  member's own intentional  misconduct  or  willful negligence,  or incurred during a period of unauthorized absence. 13.10.2.  Amount  Payable.    The  monthly  amount  of  CIP  was  $430  and  was  paid  in addition  to  any  other  pay  or  allowance  EXCEPT  hostile  fire/imminent  danger  pay (HFP/IDP); the monthly amount of CIP was offset by the HFP/IDP received by the member for the same month.  CIP  was  not pro-rated, but paid for the entire month for any month in which the member was eligible to receive it. 13.10.3.  Payment of CIP, on a monthly basis, was authorized beginning the month after the date  on  which  the  member  was  evacuated  from  the  theater  of  the  combat  operation  or 306 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 combat zone for medical treatment.  CIP was not payable for any months prior to March 2006. If a  member incurred a  qualifying  wound,  injury,  or  illness  before  March  23,  2006,  and the  member  continued  to  satisfy  the eligibility criteria after that date, payment of CIP was authorized beginning March 2006 and continuing until the member was no longer entitled. 13.10.4.  CIP  eligibility  for  a  member  was  stopped  at  the  end  of  the  first  month  during which any of the following applied: 13.10.4.1.  The  member  was  paid  a  benefit  under  Traumatic  Servicemembers'  Group Life Insurance (T-SGLI), or 13.10.4.2.  The  member  received  notification  of  the  eligibility  for  a  benefit  under  T-SGLI and a period of 30 days expired after the date of such notification, or 13.10.4.3.  The  member  was  no longer  hospitalized in a  military treatment  facility  or a facility under the auspices of the military health care system. 13.10.5.  Once a member lost entitlement to CIP, eligibility could not be reestablished if the member was rehospitalized for the same injury, wound, or illness. 13.10.6.  Processing  in  DJMS-AC.    There  was  no  base-level  processing  required  for  CIP. Each  member  who  was  identified  as  wounded,  injured,  or  ill  and  was  evacuated  from  a theater  of  combat  operations  was  the  subject  of  a  CMS  case  established  by  HQ  AFPC Casualty  Matters.    Those  cases  were  monitored  by  the  Special  Assistance  Branch  at DFAS-DE.   As part  of the  monitoring process, DFAS-DE ensured  members were paid all entitlements due, to include CIP.  CIP was paid in the 09 (save pay) entry on the MMPA. 13.10.6.1.  If  a  member  was  identified  as  injured  and  did  not  receive  the  proper entitlements, contact HQ AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-3505. 13.10.6.2.  If  a  member  was  receiving  CIP  at  less  than  $430  per  month,  check  to  see  if there was an open FID 23 (HFP/IDP) on the MMPA for the same period.  If not, check to see if there was a CMS case and use it to query DFAS to determine the reason. 13.11.  Pay  and  Allowances Continuation (PAC) Program.  Effective  15  May  2008,  the  Pay and Allowances Continuation Program (PAC) replaced CIP.  The information on CIP is provided for  historical  purposes.    PAC  provides  for  continuation  of  the  pay  and  allowances  an  eligible member  was  receiving  at  the  time  the  member  was  injured,  wounded,  or  became  ill,  “in  the line of duty” while serving in a combat operation or a combat zone, a hostile fire area, or while exposed to a  hostile  fire  event  (regardless  of  location), and  is  hospitalized  for  treatment  of the wound, injury or illness.  See paragraph 13.11.3.3 below for definition of  “in the line  of  duty” for PAC purposes.   A  member  may receive  payment under Traumatic Service members’ Group Life Insurance (T-SGLI) and remain entitled to payment under PAC. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 307  13.11.1.  Payment of Hardship Duty Pay – Location (HDP-L). 13.11.1.1.  A  member  who  is  on  temporary/deployed/attached  duty  of  over  30  days duration  in  a  designated  hardship  duty  location  for  purpose  of  HDP-L,  and  who  is wounded,  injured,  or becomes  ill  within  the  first 30 days of  serving in the  designated area,  will  be  considered  eligible  for  HDP-L  at  the  time  the  wound,  injury  or  illness  is incurred. 13.11.1.2.  If  the  member  is  determined  eligible  for  HDP-L  at  the  time  the  qualifying wound, injury or illness occurred, payment of HDP-L is continued under PAC. 13.11.2.  Imminent  Danger  Pay/Hostile  Fire  Pay  (IDP/HFP)  and  Combat  Zone  Tax Exclusion (CZTE). 13.11.2.1.  IDP and CZTE continue beyond the previous 3 month (90 day) period. 13.11.3.  PAC entitlement period. 13.11.3.1.  Payment under PAC begins on the date of evacuation from the combat theater through the end of the first month beginning after the earliest of the following dates: 13.11.3.1.1.  The date on which the member is returned for assignment to other than a medical or patient unit for duty (returned to his/her home base for duty); 13.11.3.1.2.  The  date  on  which  the  member  is  discharged,  separated,  or  retired (including temporary disability retirement) from the uniformed service; or 13.11.3.1.3.  One year after the date on which the member is first hospitalized for the treatment  of  the  wound,  injury,  or  illness,  except  that  the  Principle  Deputy  Under Secretary  of  Defense  for  Personnel  and  Readiness  (PDUSD)(P&R)  may  extend the increments  under  extraordinary circumstances. termination  date in  six (6)  month 13.11.3.2.  In  addition  to  the  entitlements  the  member  was  receiving  at  the  time  of evacuation,  PAC  entitles  the  member  to  the  incidental  and  expense  (IE)  portion  of  per diem,  $105  per  month,  prorated  for  the  first  month  to  the  date  of  evacuation.  For example,  if a member is  evacuated  on 6 June  08,  the  PAC  payment  for  June  is  $87.50 (30  days  /$105.00  =  3.50  daily  rate  x  25  days  =  $87.50  due  from  6-30  June).    Each month thereafter, the member receives $105 per month. 13.11.3.3.  Qualifying  members  are  considered  “in  the  line  of  duty”  unless  the  illness, wound, or injury is the result of the member’s intentional misconduct or willful negligence or  is  incurred  during  a  period  of  unauthorized  absence.    A  hospitalized  member  under the  PAC  program  may  initially  be  admitted  as  an  inpatient  and  later  receive  outpatient rehabilitation  or  may  receive  some other  form of appropriate  medical  care in a military treatment facility, a Veterans’ Affairs or civilian hospital, or other treatment facility.  The hospitalization may occur immediately or at a later time if the need for hospitalization is not initially evident. 13.11.4.  Transition  from  CIP  to  PAC.  A  member  may  have  qualified  for  CIP  before  the effective  date  of  PAC  and  be  eligible  for  payment  under  PAC.  Beginning  in  June  08,  that member will be paid under PAC. 308 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 13.11.5.  Members may not receive payment under CIP and PAC at the same time. 13.11.6.  Processing in DJMS-AC. 13.11.6.1.  There  is  no  base-level  or  AFFSC  processing  required  under  PAC.    DFAS makes payment using FID 09, 23, with a save pay type of G, to pay the IE portion. 13.11.6.2.  DFAS monitors the pay records daily to ensure members’ are paid correctly for the authorized period and that entitlements are stopped when appropriate. 13.11.6.3.  If a member you service is not receiving payment under PAC but appears to be entitled, contact HQ AFPC/DPWCS at DSN 665-3505. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 309  Chapter 14 SPECIAL PAY-DIVING DUTY 14.1.

Description.  Overseas  tour  extension  incentive  pay  is  a  special  pay  for  certain  eligible members. For entitlement information, see DoDFMR, Vol 7A, Chapter 14.  Compensation for the extension is available as: 15.1.1.  Monthly installments not to exceed $80 per month. 15.1.2.  Annual  bonus  not  to  exceed  $2000  payable  in  lump  sum  or  eleven  monthly installment payments of $166.66 and one installment of $166.74. 15.1.3.  30-day non-chargeable leave. 15.1.4.  15-day non-chargeable leave plus round-trip transportation at government expense. 15.2.  Source of Input.  (Workaround) The current method of processing this entitlement is for the  MPF  to  set  up  a  CMS  case  on  the  individual  entitled  and  refer  to  the  DFAS  AC CEFIP/FLPP/OTEIP box with all required information.  Central site pays OTEIP using the FID 31  for  enlisted  and  FID  08  for  officers.  NOTE:  The  new  FCPS  (forward  compatible  pay system) will use the FID 18 submitted by the MPF to make payment.  The FID 18 format will be included with the new system requirements to be implemented at a later date. 15.3.  Recoupment.  If a member enters an extension and receives the lump sum payment, and is then curtailed (due to other than mission requirements), a recoupment rate of $166.66 per month is  established  on the member’s MMPA for each month, or portion thereof, by which the tour is shortened.  Example:  member serves 18 days in January; collection is $166.66 for the month of January.  Personnel will provide the DD Form 139 indicating member notification of the debt and the total dollar amount of debt.  If the member cannot afford to repay the full amount all at once, set a repay rate as required for a debt to the U.S. (see DFAS-DEM 7073-1, chapter 69).  In no case will the collection be less than $50.00 per month.” 15.4.  Assignment  Incentive  Pay  –  Korea.  On  27  April  2004,  the  Principal  Deputy  Under Secretary  of  Defense,  Personnel  and  Readiness,  authorized  the  Air  Force  AIP  Korea  (KAIP) assignment program. 15.4.1.  Airmen  who  volunteer  to  serve  a  24  month  unaccompanied  or  36  month accompanied  tour  before  arriving  in  Korea,  and  who  enter  such  agreement  prior  to completion  of the  first 30 days  in country,  will receive $300  per  month,  prorated  from  the date of arrival through their new tour end date. 15.4.2.  KAIP  is  paid  by  DFAS-DE  using  the  09,  FID  30,  based  on  CMS  cases  from personnel.  Personnel also notifies DFAS, via CMS case, to stop the entitlement. 15.4.3.  KAIP is stopped upon termination of the  contract or curtailment of the agreed-upon tour  of  duty  for  any  reason,  either  voluntary  or  involuntary.    Entitlement  to  KAIP  is  also terminated if the member is determined to be absent without leave or enters confinement. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 315  15.4.4.  Payment of KAIP is prorated for partial months served in the assignment. 15.4.5.  Airmen who elect KAIP are not eligible for concurrent OTEIP or IPCOT. 15.5.  Critical Skills Assignment Incentive Pay (CSAIP). 15.5.1.  Air Force personnel in Combat Control (1C2XX) and Pararescue (1T2XX) Air Force Specialties  (AFSCs)  and  CCMs  at  AFSOC  and  SOCOM  with  the  2AFSC  of  1C2XX  and 1T2XX may be eligible for CSAIP.  Members who meet these criteria and sign an agreement to remain on active duty for the required  period  will receive CSAIP  in the amount  of $750 per month. 15.5.2.

Manual  Payment  Computation  Examples.  The  following  options  of  the  manual payment computations are for information purposes only. Example:  An officer entitled to ACIP with  a  written  agreement  to  remain  on  active  duty  to  complete  14  years  of  commissioned service.   Contract start and stop dates are 1 June 1995 and 30 December 1999, respectively. 16.6.1.  Option  1  -  initial  payment  equal  to  50%  of  the  total  authorized  amount,  with  the balance paid in equal annual installments. 16.6.1.1.  Compute  the  daily  rate  by  dividing  maximum  annual  amount  per  DoDFMR ($12,000 for each year covered by the agreement, if the officer agrees to remain on active duty to complete 14 years  of commissioned  service,  or $6,000 for  each  year covered  by the agreement, if  the officer agrees to remain on active  duty for 1 or 2 years) by 360 to obtain a daily rate, i.e., $12,000/360 = $33.33333 per day. 16.6.1.2.  Compute length of time covered by the agreement by subtracting contract start date from contract stop date:    Year  Month 99 95 4 = 12 06 6 Day 30 01 29 + 1 (inclusive days) 16.6.1.3.  Compute  total  number  of  days  covered  by  the  agreement  by  multiplying number  of  years  X  360  days  +  number  of  months  X  30  days  +  number  of  days,  i.e., 4 years X 360 + 6 months X 30 + 30 = 1,650 days. 16.6.1.4.  Compute  total  authorized  amount  by  multiplying  total  number  of  days covered by the agreement by the daily rate, i.e., 1650 X 33.33333 = $55,000. 16.6.1.5.  Compute  initial  payment  amount  by  multiplying  total  authorized  amount  by .50, i.e., $55,000 X .50 = $27,500. 16.6.1.6.  Compute  daily  rate  for  remaining  annual  installments  by  dividing  remaining amount,  by i.e.,  $27,500  ($55,000 - $27,500 initial payment)/1290  days (1,650  -  360 days) = $21.31782.   Initial payment and remaining installments will be computed as follows: the  number  of  days  remaining in the  agreement,     1st Year (950601-960530) - $27,500.00 ($55,000 X .50) 2nd Year (960601-970530) - $7,674.42 (360 days X $21.31782) 3rd Year (970601-980530) - $7,674.42 (360 days X $21.31782) 4th Year (980601-990530) - $7,674.42 (360 days X $21.31782) 5th Year (990601-991230) - $4,476.74 (total amount of contract - amounts paid to date = final payment amount) 320 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 16.6.1.7.  FITW  will  be  deducted  at  the  flat  rate  of  25%.  SITW  (if  applicable)  will  be deducted  at  the  one-time  payment  rate  corresponding  to  the  member’s  state  of  legal residence. 16.6.2.  Option 2 - annual installments for the period of the agreement. 16.6.2.1.  Perform steps 1 through 4 from Option 1. 16.6.2.2.  Member  will  receive  $12,000  (gross)  each  year,  with  the  exception  of  the final year which will be $7000.  Payments are as follows:     1st Year (950601-960530) - $12,000.00 (360 days X $33.33333) 2nd Year (960601-970530) - $12,000.00 (360 days X $33.33333) 3rd Year (970601-980530) - $12,000.00 (360 days X $33.33333) 4th Year (980601-990530) - $12,000.00 (360 days X $33.33333) 5th Year (990601-991230) - $7,000.00 (total amount of contract - amounts paid to date = final payment amount) 16.6.2.3.  FITW  will  be  deducted  at  the  flat  rate  of  25%.  SITW  (if  applicable)  will  be deducted  at  the  one-time  payment  rate  corresponding  to  the  member’s  state  of  legal residence. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 321  Figure 16.1.

Description.  Officers  meeting  the  conditions  of  entitlement  to  ESCCP  as  described  in the  DoD-  FMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  16,  may  receive  either  a lump  sum  or  yearly  installment not to exceed $3,000 for each year of obligated service agreed to in the written agreement. 17.2.  Source  of  Input.  AFPC  establishes  entitlement  to  ESCCP  using  a  3203  transaction.  Processed transactions will appear in section 6 of the member's servicing FSO's DTR; partially processed or rejected transaction appears in Section 3. 17.3.  Payment.  For  central  payees,  installments  of  this  type  bonus  are  paid  from  central  site through the electronic funds transfer system (EFTS).  Local payees are paid via the one-time pay authorization  list  at  base  level.  When  a  member  is  paid  by  EFTS,  base  level  is  notified  by message on the one-time pay authorization list, instead of receiving a pay authorization to make payment  locally.  Members  in  a  TDY  or  PCS  status,  who  are  central  payees,  will  have  their installments released to EFTS on the effective date.  Locally paid  members,  who  are  TDY,  may receive those payments from the TDY FSO.  Locally paid members, who are in PCS status may be  paid  the  installments  by  any  FSO  since  no  pay  authorization  will  be  issued.  In  this  case, gaining  FSOs  should  determine  if  the  payment  was  made  by  another  FSO  before  routinely issuing a bonus payment. 326 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 17.1.

Description.  There are currently two types of Hardship Duty Pay (HDP); Hardship Duty Pay Location  (HDP-L)  and  Hardship  Duty  Pay  Mission  (HDP-M).   Both  types  are  payable  to both enlisted and officers and limited to no more than $300 in any one month.  See DoDFMR, Vol 7A, Chapter 17, for more specific conditions of entitlement. 18.1.1.  HDP-L  is  paid  based  on  location  and  replaces  the  old  Foreign  Duty  Pay  (FDP).  (NOTE: Members who arrived PCS at an old HDP-L (FDP) area before 01/01/02 are entitled to the old HDP-L for that area until they PCS.  Therefore, do not automatically stop the FID 22.  See paragraph 18.3 for FID 22 processing instructions.  No member is entitled to both the new and the old for the same dates.) 18.1.2.  HDP-M  is  paid  at  the  rate  of  $150  and  is  based  on  the  mission  the  member  is performing.  The qualifying missions are specified in the DoDFMR, Vol 7A, chapter 17. 18.2.  Source of Input of HDP Transactions (FID 14). 18.2.1.  HDP-L is paid by the FSO using format ID (FID) 14.  The FID 14 requires both the duty-type field and the location code from DJMS table 118. 18.2.1.1.  The Duty-Type field requires either an "M" for Mission or "L" for Location. 18.2.1.2.  Location  Codes  can  be  found  in  DJMS  under  Table  118.    The  location  code determines  the  amount  paid  to  the  member.    Example:    Location  code  AK001  is  ALASKA, ATTU and the rate in the table is $150.00. 18.2.1.3.  See paragraph 18.1.2 for information regarding entitlement to HDP-M. 18.2.2.  Process a 1401 (Figure  18.3) to  start the  entitlement  once  the  member  has  been in country for over 30 days. 18.2.3.  Process  a 1402 to stop the entitlement when the travel voucher is filed at the end of the period in the qualifying country. 18.2.4.  Process a 1403 to report the entitlement. 18.2.5.  Process a 1404 to change the entitlement. 18.2.6.  Process a 1405 to correct the entitlement. 18.2.7.  Process a 1406 to cancel the entitlement. 18.3.  Input of the Old FDP/HDP-L Transactions for those Members who were Already on Station  in  a  Qualifying  (FDP)  Area  Before  01/01/02.  These  are  the  only  members  who  are entitled  to  the  old  HDP-L  for  that  area  until  they  PCS.    Therefore,  do  not  automatically  stop the FID 22 if currently on a member’s record.  Research the entitlement to determine whether it is valid. 18.3.1.  2201 (HDP-L Start) establishes the HDP-L for an indefinite period (Figure 18.1). 328 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 18.3.2.  2202  (HSP-L  Stop)  terminates  entitlement  when  a  member  becomes  ineligible (Figure 18.1). The member is no longer entitled when: 18.3.2.1.  Departs the station as a result of permanent change of station. 18.3.2.2.  Member is in a non-pay status. 18.3.2.3.  Leaves  the  old  (HDP-L  (CP))  area  of  entitlement  for  a  TDY  and  becomes entitled to a higher rate of HDP-L (DA)) for the period of TDY and becomes entitled to a higher  rate  of  HDP-L  (DA)  for  the  period  of  TDY;  entitlement  to  old  HDP-L  resumes upon member’s return to PDS, if grandfathered at the PDS. 18.3.3.  2203  (HDP  report)  establishes  HDP  as  a  one-time  entitlement  with  specified inclusive dates (Figure 18.1). 18.3.4.  2205 (HDP correct) corrects an erroneous HDP transaction (Figure 18.2). 18.3.5.  2206 (HDP cancel) voids a previous HDP start or report transaction (Figure 18.1). 18.4.  Substantiating Documents. 18.4.1.  For HDP-L, use the member’s orders assigning him/her to a qualified area. 18.4.2.  For HDP-M, use the member’s orders to the specific mission. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 329  Figure 18.1.  Formats to Start/Stop, Report/Cancel Hardship Duty Pay.

Description.  Sea duty pay and/or career sea pay premium are payable to E-4s and above who are entitled to such pay as shown in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 18.  Sea duty pay and  career  sea pay  premium are  stopped  by  processing a PCS  departure transaction (SH03), or upon receipt of an E603 transaction  for a change  of category (enlisted to officer).  If member is still entitled to sea duty pay/career sea pay premium, a new start transaction must be input. 19.2.  Source  of  Input.  FSOs  prepare  input  for  all  sea  duty  pay  transactions  based  on substantiating documentation provided by member's commander or temporary duty (TDY) travel voucher.  Prepare FID 27 input as shown in Figure 19.4 through Figure 19.5. 19.2.1.  Start Sea Duty - 2701.  Opens entitlement on the MMPA. 19.2.2.  Stop Sea Duty - 2702.  Closes the open entitlement and the Career Sea Pay premium entry, if applicable. 19.2.3.  Report  Sea  Duty  -  2703.   Credits  member  with  one-time  entitlement  for  a  specific period of time. 19.2.4.  Change  Sea  Duty  -  2704.    Changes  the  vessel  category  in  an  open  27  transaction.  Closes the open entitlement and creates a new open entry reflecting the new data. 19.2.5.  Correct Sea Duty - 2705.  Corrects a previous transaction submitted with an error. 19.2.6.  Cancel Sea Duty - 2706.  Cancels sea duty previously input. 19.3.  Vessel Categories.  There are 3 categories of vessels: 19.3.1.  Category  A.  Vessel  is  in active  status, in  commission  or  in  service,  whose primary mission is accomplished underway.  Members are entitled to payment of career sea pay. 19.3.2.  Category  B.  Vessel  is  in  active  status,  in  commission  or  in  service,  whose  primary mission  is  accomplished  in  home-port,  or  in  a  port  50  miles  or  less  from  home-port. Members are not entitled to payment of career sea pay.  Reference paragraph 19.7. 19.3.3.  Category  C.    Also  considered  a  category  B  vessel,  but  vessel  is  underway,  or  in  a port more than 50 miles from home-port.  Members are entitled to payment of career sea pay. 19.4.  Sea Duty Counter FID T2.  The T2 is a counter that accumulates the members’ creditable sea  duty  time.    The  sea  duty  time  is  used  to  create  a  future  date  for  longevity  (sea  duty time)  rate  increases.  DJMS-AC  will  automatically  add  creditable  sea  duty  time  from  FID  27 entry.    This  entry  will  always  remain  open  and  will  show  total  days  of  sea  duty.    T205 transactions to adjust the T2 are restricted to DFAS-DE/FJP. 19.4.1.  Initial  Period  of  Sea  Duty  for  Member.    The  initial  27  (2701/2703)  entry,  for  a member who has no previous sea duty time, will automatically create the T2.  DJMS will add the correct amount of sea duty time to the counter. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 335  19.4.2.  Adjustments for Periods Outside IAS.  The field will provide the details to central site by message.  The center will adjust the sea duty pay utilizing unique transactions.  They will process a T205 to correct the T2.  The T2 adjustment will be followed by a 2705 transaction that  has  dates  matching  the  earliest  sea  pay  entry  on  the  MMPA.  This  will  initiate  the recalculation of pay within IAS affected by the adjustment and create a new longevity future for sea pay. 19.4.3.  Correcting  T2  for  Erroneous  Sea  Time.    The  field  will  provide  the  correct  data  to central site by message.  The center will process a T205 to correct the T2.  The T2 adjustment will be followed by a 2705 transaction that has dates matching the earliest sea pay entry on the MMPA.  This will initiate the recalculation of pay within IAS affected by the adjustment and create a new longevity future for sea pay. 19.4.4.  Correcting Previous Sea Pay Entries that are Within IAS and are on the MMPA.  The field will input appropriate 27 transactions.  These transactions will adjust the T2 and initiate the  recalculation  of  pay  within  IAS  affected  by  the  adjustment  and  create  a  new  longevity future for sea pay. 19.5.  Grades 31 thru 33.  Grades  below  34  do  not  receive  sea  pay,  however,  they  do  receive credit  for sea duty time.  FID 27 transactions will be input with the appropriate vessel category for  these  members,  and  DJMS  will  automatically  credit  sea  duty  time.  When  the  member  is promoted to grade 34, the appropriate rate of pay will be started. 19.6.  Officer  Under  3  Years  Sea  Duty.  Officers  with  less  than  3  years  of  sea  duty  do  not receive  sea pay, however, they do receive credit for sea duty time.  FID 27 transactions will be input,  with  the  appropriate  vessel  category,  for  these  officers  and  DJMS  will  automatically credit sea time.   When the 3 year point is reached, the appropriate rate of pay will be started. 19.7.  Members  Aboard  Category  B  Vessel.  Members  serving  aboard  category  B  vessels  do not  receive  sea  pay,  however,  they  do  receive  credit  for  sea  duty  time.    FID  27  transactions will  be  input  for  these  members and DJMS  will automatically  credit  sea time.   For  periods  of time  when  the  vessel  is  underway  or  in  a  status  which  authorizes  sea  pay,  input  FID  2704 category change to switch to and from non-paying status and paying status. 19.8.  Restriction.  Foreign duty pay cannot be paid for the same period as sea pay except when member  is  aboard  a  category  B  vessel  or  when  there  is  a  period  on  non-pay  sea  pay (see paragraphs 19.5 and 19.7 above.) 19.9.  Substantiating  Documents.  Use  DD  Form  114,  Military  Pay  Order  (MPO),  or  special orders  certified  by  the  member's  commander  assigning  member  to  sea  duty  showing  the  date member  reported  and  departed  sea  duty  pay  location  (see  Figure  19.5).  Use  travel  settlement vouchers to determine periods of entitlement while TDY. 19.10.  Procedures.  If a document showing the performance of sea duty is received, determine if member  was previously paid for that period of sea duty.  If the member claims previous unpaid periods  of  sea  duty  on  a  vessel,  determine  the  previous  periods.    Use  all  means  available (MMPA  histories,  military  pay  records,  personnel  records,  orders,  etc.)  to  determine  actual inclusive  dates  served.   Convert to  total  days  of  sea duty  based  on 30  day  months and use the result to verify the T2 data on the MMPA. 336 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 19.10.1.

Officers  who  have  continuous  or conditional  ACIP  may  also  be  entitled  to  two  HDIPs  (other  than  HDIP  for  flying)  if  the conditions  for the  entitlement  have been  met independently.  However, if  assigned  by  orders to diving duty, then members may only receive one HDIP. 354 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 22 AERIAL FLIGHT INCENTIVE PAYS 22.1.  Description.  Entitlement  conditions  for  payment  of  Aviation  Career  Incentive  Pay (ACIP)  and  Hazardous  Duty  Incentive  Pay  (HDIP)  are  found  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A, chapters  22  through  24.  Entitlement  information  for  career  enlisted  flyer  incentive  pay (CEFIP) has not yet been added to the DoDFMR Vol 7A. 22.2.  Source of Input.  Host Aviation Resource Management Office (HARM) initiates AF Form 1887, Request and Authorization for Aeronautical Orders, for members entitled to ACIP or HDIP (see Figure 22.1).  Table 22.1 lists types and sources of supporting documents used to start, stop, and report ACIP and HDIP.  All aeronautical orders (AOs) must show a termination date for non- crew members.  The HARM establishes a case management system (CMS) case when a member gains or loses eligibility for flight pay. 22.2.1.  AOs  or  MPOs  supporting  the  certifying  officer's  own  entitlement  must  also  be signed by the commander or other designated person who has knowledge of the facts. 22.2.2.  Administrative records  must  be  maintained at  base level to authorize  payments and must  be  available  for  review  by if  called  for  (see AFM 60-352 and MS Comp Gen B-12507, May 27, 1964). the  General  Accounting  Office 22.3.  Processing Flight Pay Transactions: 22.3.1.  Flight-Crew  Status.    Identifies  the  applicable  rate  and  also  establishes  future transactions for increases, decreases, or discontinuances as necessary. 22.3.1.1.  ACIP/HDIP for  officers  is input by  finance based on CMS  case  established by the HARM and referred to FSO for action.  Officers:  for O-7 and above with over 25 years of officer service who perform qualified aviator duty, start HDIP using crew status code 1 based on current AF Form 1887, Aeronautical Order (AO).  Bases that have cutover to the AFFSC print the AO and scan into EIM for processing at the AFFSC. 22.3.1.1.1.  Code 1 - Identifies a rated officer entitled to ACIP at rates shown in the DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  22,  table  22-3.    This  code  will  provide  for programmatic increases  or  decreases  based  on  Aviation  Service  Date (ASD)/Officer  Service  Date  (OSD).    Continuous  ACIP  stops  programmatically  at the 25-year point, based  on  the  member's  OSD.   However, member may be entitled to Conditional ACIP after that time. 22.3.1.1.2.  Code  2  -  Identifies  non-rated  officer  non-crew  members  entitled  to HDIP  at  the  rate  prescribed  by  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  22  through  24.  An  officer  in  this  category  can  be  identified  by  aviation  service  code  (ASC)  9C  in item 16 of the AO.  This type of flight pay will automatically terminate upon PCS. 22.3.1.1.3.  Code  3  -  Identifies  a  non-rated  officer  crewmember.    An  officer  in  this category  can be identified by ASC 9D in item 16 of the AO.  This flight-crew status will continue to pay HDIP until stopped by appropriate transaction input. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 355  22.3.1.1.4.  Code  4  -  Identifies  AWACS  air  weapons  controllers.    An  officer  in  this category can be identified by ASC 9W in item 16 of the AO.  This code will provide for programmatic increases or decreases based on AWACS experience date. 22.3.1.2.  Enlisted: 22.3.1.2.1.  Code 1  - Identifies an  enlisted crewmember  ASC 9D.  The rates  payable are shown in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 22, table 22-1.  This type of flight pay will continue until stopped by appropriate transaction input. 22.3.1.2.2.  Code  2  -  Identifies  an  enlisted  non-crew  member  ASC  9C,  paid  at  the rates shown in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 22 through 24.  This type of flight pay will automatically terminate upon separation or PCS. 22.3.1.2.3.  Code 4  - Identifies  AWACS air  weapons controllers.   A member  in  this category can be identified by ASC 9W in item 16 of the AO.  This code will provide for programmatic increases or decreases based on AWACS experience date. 22.3.1.2.4.  Code 6 – Identifies members receiving Career Enlisted Flyer Incentive Pay (CEFIP).  CEFIP  cases  are  established  by  the  HARM  and  sent  directly  to  DFAS  for processing.  See paragraph 22.6 for information on CEFIP. 22.3.1.2.5.  Code 7 – Identifies members receiving Conditional CEFIP.  CEFIP cases are  established  by  the  HARM  and  sent  directly  to  DFAS  for  processing.  See paragraph 22.6 below for information on CEFIP. 22.3.2.  ASD/OSD.  These dates dictate the rates payable to rated officers entitled to ACIP.  To pay the  entitlement  correctly,  ASD/OSD  must  be  in  an  open  TN  entry  on  the  MMPA  or  in the 1201 (start) or 1203 (report) transaction. 22.3.3.  AWACS  Experience  Date.    This  date,  in  addition  to  the  grade,  determines  the  rate payable to members entitled to HDIP. 22.3.3.1.  The AWACS experience date is the first day of training in career field G17XX. Use the TDY  orders  assigning  the  member  to  AWACS  training  to  establish  the  original AWACS  experience  date.    If  the  officer  changes  from  career  field  G17XX  and  is  no longer  eligible  for  AWACS,  and  at  a  later  date  reenters  the  G17XX  career  field,  the AWACS  experience  date  will be  re-computed by  AFPC and a new  date  will be input to change the date in the TN entry. 22.3.3.2.  The  AWACS  experience  date  will  not  be  re-computed  if  member  performs other than AWACS duty for less than 90 days. 356 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 22.3.3.3.  If member performs primary duties other than AWACS duty for more than 90 days,  the  date  will  be  re-computed.    For  example,  original  AWACS  experience  date  is 811001 and member does not  perform  primary  AWACS duty for 4 months and 16 days.  The new AWACS experience date becomes 820217.      22.4.  Computer Actions - Selective Transactions: 22.4.1.  Start  Flight  Pay  for  Officers  -  Crew  Status  1.    This  transaction  establishes  the entitlement on the MMPA based on the ASD/OSD (TN entry) on the MMPA.  If no TN entry has been  established on the  MMPA, the  ASD/OSD in the  start  transaction will  create a TN entry on which to base rates.  When the ASD/OSD is in the transaction and the MMPA shows a TN entry established by AFPC, the transaction dates are ignored.  The start transaction will create a "future" to update ACIP based on ASD or OSD, whichever applies. 22.4.2.  Start  Flight  Pay  for Officers  - Crew  Status 3.   This transaction establishes HDIP at the rates shown in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 22 through 24.  This transaction does not require ASD/ OSD.  No "future" transaction is created to either adjust rates or terminate entitlement. 22.4.3.  Start Flight Pay for Officers or Enlisted - Crew Status 2.  This transaction establishes HDIP  at  the  rates  shown  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapters  22  through  24.    No ASD/OSD is required. This type of flight pay will automatically terminate for both enlisted and officers upon PCS. 22.4.4.  Start Flight Pay for Enlisted - Crew Status 1.  This transaction starts flight pay based on  grade as  shown in the DoDFMR,  Volume 7A.  No  futures are  established  to  discontinue the entitlement. 22.4.5.  Start  AWACS  Pay  for  Members  -  Crew  Status  4.    This  transaction  establishes  the entitlement on the MMPA based on the AWACS experience date.   If no TN entry has been established on the MMPA, the AWACS experience date in the start transaction will create a TN  entry  on  which  to  base  rates.    These  rates  are  shown  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A, chapters  22  through  24.    Also,  a  management  notice  UQ03  will  be  sent  to  AFPC  for  their confirmation  or correction.  When the  AWACS  experience  date  is  in  the  transaction  and the  MMPA  shows  a  TN  entry  established  by  AFPC,  the  transaction  dates  are  ignored.  The  start  transaction  will  create  a  "future"  to  update  AWACS  experience  date.    AWACS  is payable to  officers assigned an  AFSC  of G17XX and are assigned  to the  following aircraft: E-2C, E-3A, EC-130, or the British Nimrod. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 357  22.4.6.  Confirmation of  ASD/OSD  for Rated Officers  (AFPC input).  The  TN05  transaction confirms the dates in the 1201 for officers with a crew status 1.  A "Y" indicator is established in the TN entry upon processing.  If the dates in the TN entry disagree with those in the TN05 transaction, the TN05 transaction will take precedence.  The ASD/OSD dates are changed and a management notice is sent to DFAS-JM/DE to determine if a rate adjustment is needed.  The effective date of the entitlement is not changed, but the "future" is corrected to show the new effective date of the next rate adjustment. 22.4.7.  Closure  of  ASD/OSD  for  Rated  Officers  (AFPC  input).    When  a  blank  TN05  is received (meaning member is no longer entitled to ACIP), it closes the open TN entry on the MMPA, stops the entitlement at  the  end  of the  previous  processing  month, and  issues a  UI management  notice to  the FSO.   The  management  notice states:   "ASD/OSD  entry  closed, flight  pay  stopped  end  of  previous  processing  month.    1205  action  may  be  required  to correct stop date." 22.5.  Verification of DJMS and Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS): 22.5.1.  A  comparison  of  the  DJMS  records  and  Flight  Management  Records  will  be  made quarterly  to  detect  differences  in  entitlements  and  pay.    The  FSO  requests  an  entitlement verification  through  the DMO to identify all  members  currently being  paid  flight  pay (FID 12), HDIP (FID 12), and Parachute Pay (FID 15) and forwards the listing to the HARM.  The HARM reviews the listing and determines if the entitlement is  valid for all members listed.  This  listing  is  also  used  to  identify  personnel  not  being  paid  flight  pay  for  which  an entitlement exists at the HARM. 22.5.2.  Upon  receipt  of  the  listing,  the  HARM  or  FSO  should  research  to  see  if  any discrepancies  exist.    The  research  is  to  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  unprocessed  AOs, flight  records,  etc.    Upon  completion  of  the  research,  necessary  AOs,  MPOs,  and corresponding HARM or DJMS input is processed. 22.6.  Workaround Procedures for Career Enlisted Flight Incentive Pay (CEFIP). 22.6.1.  Background:    Career  Enlisted  Flyer  Incentive  Pay  was  implemented  as  a  new entitlement  for  enlisted  members,  as  of  1  October  1999.  The  FY  2000  National  Defense Authorization  Act  contained  legislation  authorizing  certain  career  flyers  to  receive  this incentive  pay.    This  entitlement  is  paid  based  on  the  number  of  years  of  aviation  service (ASD)  and  is  a  prorated  entitlement.    The  law  does  not  allow  most  CEFIP  members  to receive  special  duty  assignment  pay  (SDAP)  along  with  the  CEFIP.  However,  there  was  a provision  in  the  law  to  entitle  members  to  save  pay  for  the  SDAP  they  were receiving  at the  time  CEFIP  was  implemented;  the  save  pay  was  eliminated  in  February  2003  for members  who  were  converted  to  CEFIP  in  1999.    Members  whose  specialty  codes  were converted to CEFIP at a later date  were allowed to  continue to receive the save pay portion beyond the February 2003 date. 358 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 22.6.2.  The entitlement is taxable and payable as follows, based on years of aviation service:  4 years or less:            $150/mo over  4 years: $225/mo over  8 years: $350/mo over  14 years: $400/mo  22.6.3.  HQ USAF/XOOT identified all current career  enlisted aviators (CEA’s), authorized to receive this entitlement, to DFAS along with their aviation service dates.  Be  mindful that there are  still  members entitled to the old HDIP and these  rates are  found  in JWMM tables 003 and 004 depending on crew status. 22.6.4.  The HARM establishes a case management system (CMS) case for every transaction for  members  entitled to  or receiving CEFIP,  for a  start,  stop  or  change.  The  substantiating documentation is  the  AO,  which  substantiates the  start,  stop or change.   No longer is a DD Form  114  required  from  the  HARM  when  there  is  an  AO  issued.    There  are  situations, however, in which a member is not required to have an AO and, in those cases, the CMS case from the HARM is the substantiation.  The HARM establishes the CMS case for payment of CEFIP and refers it to DFAS-JMC/DE for action.  DFAS takes action and returns the case to the HARM for closure. 22.6.5.  Workaround for Conditional CEFIP.  Once an enlisted member has reached 25 years of flying experience his/her fly pay is based upon meeting certain flying qualifications. These include a minimum number of flying hours per month; however, members are given a grace period and hours from one month may be applied to a month that is short of the requirement.  The  HARM  is  required  to  monitor  these  hours.    Once  the  CMS  case  is  established  to  start CEFIP on a member, it does not stop until the HARM establishes a case to stop it because the member failed to meet the flying hours requirements.  The crew status for members receiving conditional CEFIP is 7 allowing it to be identified separately from regular CEFIP. 22.6.6.  FSO’s  are  required  to  produce  entitlement  verification  reports  (EVR)  in  January, April, July and October at a  minimum, as  well as upon request  by the HARM  office.   The EVR  can  be produced  either  from offline  or DMO.  Once the report is produced,  provide a copy  of  the  listing  to  the  HARM.  The  HARM  will  validate  the  entitlement  and  annotate discrepancies on the report, before returning it to the FSO.  Request that the HARM include the ASD, for each member identified with a discrepancy, on the report before sending it back to  you.   Once  the annotated report is received  from the HARM, look  at  the  amount  of  the CEFIP  the  member  is  receiving,  using  the  ASD  to  dictate  the  correct  amount,  and determine  what  action  is  needed.    Get  appropriate  supporting  documentation  from  the HARM and  ensure the necessary adjustments are made.   Maintain a copy  of the EVR  for 6 months  and,  if  changes  are  made  based  solely  on  the  report,  submit  a  copy  of  the  report with your quarterly source document submission. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 359  Figure 22.1.

Description.  The  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  24  describes  entitlement to incentive pay for parachute duty.  Two types are payable:  Type 1 for jumps from an aircraft in aerial flight, and Type 2 for jumps at a high altitude with a low opening (HALO) from an aircraft in  aerial  flight.    See  Table  23.1  for  conditions  under  which  the  jump  requirement  may  be waived. information  concerning  supporting  documentation  for  parachute 23.2.  Source of Input.  The  FSO  prepares  start and  stop  transactions  based  on  AOs  received from  the  HARM.    Other  actions  are  substantiated  by  a  DD  Form  114.    See  Table  23.2  for detailed jump  pay.  Parachute  jump  pay  is  found  on  the  MMPA  as  FID  15  (see  Figure  23.4  and  Figure  23.5).  To  ensure  that  a  member’s  duties  have  not  been  changed,  a  listing  of  members  receiving parachute  duty  pay,  prepared  by  the  FSO,  will  be  reviewed  and  verified  quarterly  by  the HARM.    There  is  no  requirement  for  the  FSO  to  maintain  a  copy  of  the  listing.  However,  if changes are required, the FSO processes the changes based on certification by the HARM and the certified document becomes a source document and must be handled accordingly. Section 23B—Flight Deck Duty (FDHDP). 23.3.  Description.  The DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 24, describes entitlement  to incentive pay  for  flight  deck  duty.   FDHDP is  prorated  for  the  days of the calendar month during  which orders are in effect provided the full months' participation requirements have been met. 23.4.  Source of Input.  The FSO prepares start transactions based on special orders assigning a member  to  flight  deck  duty.    Other  actions  are  substantiated  by  a  DD  Form  114.    FDHDP  is found  on  the  MMPA  as  FID  11  (see  Figure  23.2).  To  ensure  that  a  member’s  duties  have  not been changed, a listing of members receiving flight deck duty pay, prepared by the FSO, will be reviewed  and  verified  annually  by  the  member’s  commander.   There is  no requirement  for  the FSO to maintain a copy to this listing.  However, if changes are required, the FSO processes the changes  based  on  certification  by the commander and the certified document becomes a source document and must be handled accordingly. Section 23C—Demolition Duty. 23.5.  Description.  The  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  24  describes  entitlement demolition  duty incentive pay for members performing duty involving live explosives. to 23.6.  Source  of  Input.  Using  a  DD  Form  114  and  a  letter  prepared  by  the  unit  commander.  See  Table  23.3  for  additional  information  on  supporting  documentation  for  demolition  duty.  Demolition  duty  pay  is  found  on  the  MMPA  as  FID  10  (see  Figure  23.1).  To  ensure  that  a member’s  duties  have  not  changed,  a  listing  of  members  receiving  demolition  pay  and  a certification  letter  prepared  by  the  FSO,  will  be  reviewed  and  verified  annually  by  the AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 367  member’s commander.  FSO will suspense the item for 30 days and maintain a copy of this listing and  certification  letter  per  normal  documentation  retention.    If  changes  are  required,  the  FSO processes the  changes  based on the  certification  by the  commander and the  certified document becomes a source document and must be handled accordingly. Section 23D—Experimental Stress Duty. to 23.7.  Description.  The  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  24  describes  entitlement incentive  pay  for  experimental  stress  duty  as  any  of  the  following:    human  acceleration  or deceleration experimental subjects, human thermal experimental subjects, or human test subjects for high or low pressure chamber duty. 23.8.  Source  of  Input.  The  FSO  prepares DD Form 114 and input  for all  experimental  stress duty  transactions  based  on  assignment  orders  from  the  member's  unit.    See  Table  23.4  for additional information concerning supporting documentation for stress duty.  Experimental stress duty is found on the MMPA as FID 16 (see Figure 23.6).  To ensure that a member’s duties have not  been  changed,  a  listing  of  members  receiving  experimental  stress  duty  pay,  prepared  by FSO,  will  be  reviewed  and  verified  annually  by  the  member’s  commander.    There  is  no requirement for the FSO to maintain a copy of this listing.  However, if changes are required, the FSO processes the changes based on certification by the commander and the certified document becomes a source document and must be handled accordingly. Section 23E—Toxic Fuels or Propellants Duty, Toxic Pesticides Duty, Dangerous Viruses or Bacteria Lab Duty, and Chemical Munitions Duty. 23.9.  Description.  The DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 24 describes entitlement to incentive pay for duty involving the above types of duty. 23.10.  Source  of  Input.  The  FSO  starts  these  incentive  pays  based  on  assignment  orders received from member's unit.   All  other  input is  supported by a DD  Form 114 prepared by the FSO.   These incentive pays are identified on the MMPA as FID 16.  To ensure that a member’s duties have not been changed, a listing of members receiving any of the following, prepared by the  FSO,  will  be  reviewed  and  verified  annually.  There  is  no  requirement  for  the  FSO  to maintain a copy of this listing.  However, if changes are required, the FSO processes the changes based on certification by the commander and the certified document becomes a source document and must be handled accordingly. 23.10.1.

Workaround  Procedures  for  Hazardous  Duty  Incentive  Pay  (HDIP)  for  use  of  Ski-Equipped Aircraft on the Ground in Antarctica or on Arctic Ice-Pack. 23.11.1.  Beginning on or after 1 October 2003, Public Law 108-136, section 615, authorized hazardous duty incentive pay for use of ski-equipped aircraft to any member of a uniformed service  who  is  entitled  to  basic  pay.    To  qualify,  a  member  must  participate  in  a  take-off from,  or  landing on, the ground in Antarctica or the Arctic Ice-Pack, or the servicing of, or 368 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 the handling of cargo in connection  with such aircraft on the ground in such a polar region. The appropriate Commander will certify those  members who are under  competent  orders to perform such duty in a calendar month. 23.11.2.  The workaround  to pay the entitlement at a $5/day or $150/month rate is to use FID 16.  Process  a  1603  transaction  to  report  the  entitlement  (pays  after  the  fact)  with  a  stress-duty-pay-type-code of ‘1’.  Once the 1603 has posted to the MMPA, open  a CMS case and refer to the appropriate TD box, requesting that DFAS overlay the stress-duty-pay-type-code to ‘8’. 23.11.3.

Description.  An allowance is defined in the Definitions of the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, as a monetary amount paid to an individual in lieu of furnished quarters, subsistence, etc.  Policy on entitlement  to,  and payment  of, allowances  is  contained in DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 25 through 31.  Basic  Allowance  for  Housing  (BAH)  entitlement  is  contained  in the  Joint  Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR), chapter 10. 24.2.  Responsibilities.  Responsibility  for  determination  of  entitlement the  various allowances  rests  with  various  organizations  at  the  local  level;  for  example,  the  commander’s support  staff  is  the  primary  office  of  responsibility  in  determining  whether  to  pay  a  member Family Subsistence Supplemental Allowance (FSSA). to AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 389  Chapter 25 BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR SUBSISTENCE (BAS) 25.1.  Description.  Reference  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  Chapter  25.    Effective  1  January 2002,  all enlisted members, after completing basic training, are entitled to Basic Allowance for Subsistence  (BAS)  on  a  permanent  basis.    BAS  for  basic  trainees  will  start  on  the  date  of graduation  from  basic  training  and  will  be  paid  based  on  a  30-day  month.    The  new  types  of BAS are: 25.1.1.  Type S:  Standard 25.1.2.  Type O:  Officer BAS 25.2.  Policy on BAS – Enlisted Members:  Enlisted  members  who are  subsisted-in-kind must pay  for their  meals  by having the  discount  meal  collection rate  collected via payroll deduction.  These  members  are  now  referred  to  as  members  who  are  under  Essential  Station  Messing (ESM).    ESM  is  the  messing  declared  by  the  base  commander  responsible  for  single government quarters and the messing facility. ESM should be applied uniformly for all enlisted members who are permanently assigned to single government quarters. 25.2.1.  Exceptions:    Exceptions  to  applying  ESM  uniformly  to  enlisted  members  may  be made  only  when  assigned  duties  prevent  a  member  from  being  able  to  eat  more  than  20% of  their  meals  in  the dining facility on a regular basis.  To illustrate, using a 30-day  month, there are 90 government meals made available (3 x 30).  A percentage break down results in: 25.2.1.1.  90 meals (80%) = 72 meals 25.2.1.2.  90 meals (20%) = 18 meals 25.2.1.3.  If  a  member  consistently  misses  more  than  18  meals  per  month,  the commander  may  consider  removing  the  member  from  ESM  and  allow  BAS  without deduction.   Commanders  are required to demonstrate that  members  not  subject to ESM are  missing  meals  due  to  assigned  duties  on  a  consistent  basis.    The  AF  IMT  220, authorizing  BAS,  must  be  signed  by  the  member’s  commander  (see  paragraph  6.9  and 6.10,  AFMAN  65-116,  V2),  and  sent  to  the  installation  commander  (or  support  group commander  responsible  for  the  dining  facility)  for  approval  to  receive  type  "S"  BAS without meal deductions.  A member, grade E6 or below, who has authority to reside off base  can  be  authorized  BAS  by  the  member’s  commander  without  requiring installation/support group commander approval. 25.2.2.  Meal Collections:  Effective 1 January 2002, a DN is used to collect discounted meal charges instead of requiring a DS03 on a monthly basis (see Figure 25.5 for DN transaction format).  The  DN  transaction  is  used  for  those  members  on  BAS  who  eat  in  the  dinning facility  and  do  not  pay  for  meals  at  point  of  sale.    For  more  on  the  DN  transaction,  see paragraph  25.8    Certain  assignments  may require  collecting  payment  from the  member’s account  for  meals  the  U.S.  government  furnishes  (i.e.,  essential  station  messing  (ESM), essential  unit  messing  (EUM,  field  duty,  sea  duty,  or  group  travel).  In  these  situations, payment  shall  be  collected  at  the  discounted  meal  rate  and  collections  shall  be  made whether the meals are eaten or not.  During the first and last day of this type of assignment, 390 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 the  member’s  charge  shall  be  25  percent  of  the  daily  rate.  However,  where  a  member transitions from one  mandatory  collection  status to another, i.e.,  when a  member  goes  from an  ESM  status  directly  to  field  duty,  the  25  percent  charge  for  the  first  and  last  day  of assignment shall not apply. 25.2.3.  Refunding  Missed  Meals:    A  member  on  ESM  who  misses  meals  due  to  work schedule  conflicts  is  entitled  to  a  refund  for  missed  meals.   A  PI03  is  used  to  refund  meal collections  to  members  who  miss  any  meals  (due  to  official  reasons  and  providing commander’s approval has  been acquired) that  have already  collected via  a DN transaction (see  Figure  25.6  for  PI  transaction  format).  Use  DD  Form  1475,  Basic  Allowance  for Subsistence  –  Certification,  as  the  source  document  for  missed  meals (see Figure  25.2).  For more on the PI transaction, see paragraph 25.9. 25.2.4.  PCS  Status:    When  an  enlisted  member  goes  PCS,  BAS  will  continue  to  be  paid and  daily  meal  charges  will  not  be  collected.   The  PCS  departure  transaction  (SH03)  stops meal collections on the day prior to departure.  Conversely, when an enlisted member arrives on  station via PCS (SG03), process a DN01 to start meal collections on the day of arrival if ESM is applicable at the new PDS. 25.2.5.  Regular  TDY  Status:  Process  a  DN02  to  stop  meal  collections  when  a  member’s regular TDY status starts and a DN01 when the member returns to the PDS. 25.2.6.  Leave:    Members  on  leave  are  entitled  to  BAS  without  collection  of  meal  charges.  Process a DN02 to stop meal collections when a member’s leave starts and a DN01 when the member returns. 25.2.7.  Authority  to  mess  separately  cannot  be  granted  retroactively.  However,  a  claim  is authorized if authority  was  previously  granted.  Reasons  for  such a  claim  may include lost, damaged,  or lack  of access  to,  AF  Form  220.   All  claims require  completion  of  Section  II, block 4, of the 220, ensuring a “verbal  order of the  Commanding  Officer” (VOCO) date is entered.  The VOCO date is the date the entitlement was originally authorized. 25.2.7.1.  If  the  claim  is  within  90  days  of  the  effective  date  and  the  original  approving authority,  usually  the  Unit  Commander,  remains  unchanged,  the  AF  Form  220  is prepared and approved/ signed by the Unit Commander. 25.2.7.2.  If  the  claim  extends  beyond  a  period  of  90  days,  or  if  the  original  approving authority  has  changed,  the  AF  Form  220  is  prepared  and  must  be  approved/signed  by either  the  Base  or  Wing  Commander,  Group  Commander,  Deputy,  or  Deputy Commander for Resource Management (DCR) for bases under tri-deputy structure. 25.2.8.  Pipeline.  Members in pipeline status are not entitled to BAS without deducting meal charges  but,  since  their  records  are  coded  as  PCS  status  (ADSN  9999),  the  DN  will  not process.  Waiting until these  members arrive at their  first permanent  duty  station  to  process the DN01, retroactive to the date of departure from Lackland, imposes a financial burden on them.  The finance office at each training location must process an SG03 to gain the member which  will  allow  the  DN  to  process  and  give  the  member  access  to  myPay  during  his/her time at that location.  Finance must review the member’s entitlements (i.e.BAH, if applicable), to ensure they are not incorrectly impacted by the SG. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 391   25.3.  Review  of  BAS.  Verification  of  BAS  authorizations  must  be  performed  annually.  This verification, as determined  by the unit, must be within, and no later than, 12 months of the last verification.    For  verification  purposes,  the  FSO  provides  unit  commanders  with  a  listing, identifying  members  who  are  having  meal  charges  systematically  collected  from  their  pay.  DMO is used to prepare the listing, using the following instructions: 25.3.1.  From DMO, select file, open accounts 25.3.2.  In  the  open  accounts  dialog  box,  select  your  servicing  station  via  the  drop  down selection box. Ensure  the  radio  button  in  the  filter  section  labeled  ‘include  all’  is  selected.  Click on the ok button once the selections are made. 25.3.3.  Click on the tab labeled ‘queries’ at the bottom of the dialog box. 25.3.4.  Select the query labeled ‘meal collections’ and click on the ‘view report’ button. 25.3.5.  The  meal  collection  report  is  displayed.  You  now  have  the  option  of  printing  it  or saving  it  to  a  file.  After the verification list is  created,  send it to the unit.  The  FSO is  not required to retain a copy  of  this  listing  since  the unit  commander is the OPR  for BAS and meal deduction authorization.   See AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 6. 25.4.  Substantiating Documents: 25.4.1.  Prepared outside the FSO.  (See AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 6.): 25.4.1.1.  DD Form 114, Military Pay Order. 25.4.1.2.  AF  IMT  220,  Request,  Authorization,  and  Pay  Order  Basic  Allowance  for Subsistence (BAS). 25.4.1.3.  DD Form 1475, Basic Allowance for Subsistence Certification. 25.4.1.4.  (DELETED) 25.4.2.  PCS Travel Voucher. 25.4.3.  Accession Orders, College Senior Engineering Program (CSEP).  If member's orders state that member is entitled to BAS, it can be started using the orders as source document. 25.4.4.  PCS Orders,  Airman  Education and  Commissioning  Program (AECP). If  member's orders  state  that  member  is  entitled  to  BAS,  it  can  be  started  using  the  orders  as  source document. 25.4.5.  TDY orders and paid travel vouchers. 25.5.  FSO  Actions:  FSO  prepares  and  submits  input  for  all  BAS  transactions,  based  on substantiating documents received from the member's unit and the travel section.  FID 40 is used to pay BAS.  The transaction formats are contained in Figure 25.3 and Figure 25.4. 25.5.1.  Regular BAS (FID 40): 25.5.1.1.  Start (01):  Initiates entitlement payment and creates an open “40” entry on the MMPA. Must use BAS types of O or S. 392 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 25.5.1.2.  Stop (02):  Stops entitlement and closes an open 40 entry on the MMPA.  The stop date must be equal to or greater than 1 January 2002. 25.5.1.3.  Report  (03):  Pays  BAS  for  a  specified  period  of  time  and  must  contain inclusive dates. 25.5.1.4.  Change (04):  Changes the type of BAS being paid and can be used instead of a 4001 to start BAS entitlement.  The start date must be equal to or greater than 1 January 2002. 25.5.1.5.  Correct  (05):    Corrects  any  previous  BAS  action,  which  has  already  been processed on the member’s record. 25.5.1.6.  Cancel (06):  Cancels the open 40 entry on the MMPA.  Must contain the same start  or  stop  dates  as  transaction  being  canceled,  zero  filling  the  other  fields  as appropriate. 25.5.2.  PCS  Arrival  Transactions:    When  members  arrive  PCS,  and  are  assigned  to  single type  government  quarters  and  to  ESM,  meal  collections  are  initiated  using  a  DN01.  If  a member is assigned to single type government quarters and not assigned to the ESM, do not process  a  DN  transaction.    The  PCS  arrival  transaction  (SG03)  to  bring  the  member  on station  does  not  automatically  initiate  daily  meal  collections,  consequently, the DN01  must be manually submitted. 25.5.3.  In  1999,  a  determination  of  impracticability  was  made  for  enlisted  controllers  in Air Force command posts, wing operation centers, and higher headquarter command centers.  Enlisted  controllers  are  authorized  full  BAS  without  automatically  being  placed  on  ESM upon  arrival  at  their  permanent  duty  station.    Commanders  will  retain  the  authority  to remove  a  member  from  ESM  if  it  is  determined  to  be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  member and the Air Force. 25.6.  BAS Affecting Events Requiring Base-Level Input: 25.6.1.  Officers: 25.6.1.1.  When  an  officer  enters  one  of  the  categories  listed  in  subparagraphs 25.6.1.1.1,  25.6.1.1.2,  or  25.6.1.1.3  below,  cr eate  a  CMS  (DFAS  AC  Pay  & Allowance  box)  to  DFAS-JMCBA/DE,  to  stop  BAS,  stating  the  appropriate  reason.  When  the  member  is  no  longer  assigned  to  the   applicable  category,  create  a  CMS (DFAS  AC  Pay  &  Allowance  box)  to  DFAS-JMCBA/DE  requesting  the  member’s BAS be started.  Reference the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 25, table 25-1. 25.6.1.1.1.  Officer has no dependent and is training for, attending, or participating in an authorized  international  amateur  sports  event  and  is  subsisted  during  that  period by the sponsoring agency, or... 25.6.1.1.2.  Officer  is  furnished  subsistence  (in  cash  or  in  kind)  as  the  result  of  a fellowship or grant under provisions of AFI 36-2906, or... 25.6.1.1.3.  Officer  serving in an active duty status as an intern or resident  physician or  nurse  corps  officer  or  candidate  at  a  nonmilitary  hospital  is  furnished  meals without  charge  or  meals  are  available  without  charge  (member  without  dependents only). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 393  25.6.1.2.  Collect  for  meal  charges  as  in  Chapter  49,  Table  49.2,  when  member  is hospitalized. 25.6.1.3.  When an officer is in a group travel status, or serving on field duty, sea duty or essential  unit  messing  (EUM),  charges  for  available  meals  are  collected  in  one  of  the following ways: 25.6.1.3.1.  Cash collection, or... 25.6.1.3.2.  In accordance with instructions in AFMAN 65-116, Vol 1,   Chapter 69, or... 25.6.1.3.3.  Process a DN03 to collect meal charges for the time serving on field duty, sea duty, essential unit messing (EUM) or while in group travel status. 25.6.1.3.4.  Other.  If  an  officer  is  confined  as  a  result  of  a  court-martial  and  not sentenced  to  a  total  forfeiture  of  pay  and  allowances,  and  the  officer  did  not  pay for meals, collection for meals will be made at the BAS rate by DFAS-JMCBC/DE, based  on  the  DD  Form  114  from  the  corrections  facility.    The  appropriation reimbursed  for  this  collection  is  57(*)3500  32(*) 561.01  525725.   (See  DoDFMR, Volume  7A, table  25-1,  rule  12,  and  AFMAN  65-116,  V2,  chapter  6.)  NOTE:  Replace * in the appropriation with the single digit designator for the current fiscal year. 25.6.2.  Enlisted: 25.6.2.1.  Start BAS when member finishes BMT, effective on the date of graduation. 25.6.2.2.  Stop BAS when member:  Is removed from BAS by commander or FSO. 25.7.  BAS  Affecting  Events  Not  Requiring  Base-Level  Input.  Event and status transactions that automatically start, stop, and suspend BAS are described below.  Do not submit BAS input transactions for these event and status changes: 25.7.1.  Officer: 25.7.1.1.  Start  BAS.   Process  accession  or  separation-with-immediate  reentry message  when  commissioned  from  enlisted  status.  See Chapter  39  for  information  on processing allowances for accessions. 25.7.1.2.  Stop BAS.  Process separation message. 25.7.1.3.  Suspend  and  Restart  BAS.    Suspend  by  processing  excess  leave,  AWOL,  or desertion transactions.  Restart by processing transaction returning officer to a pay status. 25.7.2.  Enlisted Member: 25.7.2.1.  Start BAS.  Process accession on date of graduation from basic training. 25.7.2.2.  Stop BAS.  Process final separation message. 25.7.2.3.  Suspend  and  Restart  BAS.    Suspend  by  processing:    AWOL  or  deserter message,  and  sometimes  confinement  transaction.  Restart  with  message  returning member to a status for which BAS is payable. 394 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 25.7.3.  BAS Rate Change.  DFAS-DE adjusts accounts of all members receiving BAS when an Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD) rate change is received. 25.8.  Collection of Meal Charges (FID DN):  To collect meal charges, input a DN transaction (see  Figure  25.5  for  DN  transaction  format).    Meals  will  be  collected  at  a  set  rate  per  day.  Certain assignments may require collecting payment from the member’s account  for meals the U.S. Government furnishes (i.e., essential station messing (ESM), essential unit messing (EUM), field  duty,  sea  duty,  or  group  travel).  In  these  situations,  payment  shall  be  collected  at  the discounted  meal  rate  and  collections  shall  be  made  whether  the  meals  are  eaten  or  not.  Performing  duty  at  an  ashore  installation  (not  field  duty  or  EUM,  group  travel  or  attending APMT) and not assigned to ESM are entitled to BAS and may use the appropriated fund (APF) dining facility on a pay as you go basis at the standard meal rate.  When there is a disconnected period of meal collections (a period is not continuous or more than one period is included), the first  and  last  days  of  the  period  will  be  collected  at  25  percent  of  the  regular  daily  rate. NOTE:  where a member transitions from one mandatory collection status to another, i.e. going from  ESM  status  directly  to  field  duty,  the  25  percent  charge  for  the  first  and  last  day  of  the assignment does not apply. 25.8.1.  When  a  member  goes  on  leave  and  has  an  open  DN  on  the  record,  the  system suspends  the  meal  charges  for the leave period.   The 25  percent rule  does not apply to the last day before the leave starts, nor to the first day after the leave ends.  The system considers any other status change to create a break in the DN.  Example:  a member enters an  AWOL status on January 12, 2002 and returns to a duty status on January 15.  The system stops the DN  effective  January  11,  collecting  for  meals  for  that  day  at  25  percent  of  the  daily  rate.  Meal  collections  will  not  resume  until  a  DN01  is  submitted.    The  first  day  of  a  new  start period will collect at 25 percent. 25.8.2.  The  system  will  not  accept  a  DN01  (start)  or  a  DN03  (report)  if  leave  was  taken throughout  the  period  for  which  meal  collections  are  required.   To  correctly  collect  meals under  these  circumstances,  cancel  the  leave,  start  the  DN01  or  input  the  DN03  (report), and  then  re-input  the  leave.  These  transactions  should  all  be  in  the  same  update.    The system  will  suspend  collection  for  the  leave  period  and  the  end  result  will  be  the  correct collection amount for meal charges. 25.8.2.1.  Start (01).  Creates a variable open DN entry.  There can only be one open DN entry on the MMPA.  The deduction amount is based on the “deduction type” input on the input screen. 25.8.2.2.  Stop  (02).    Closes  an  open  DN  entry,  stops  the  meal  charge  collection,  and moves the closed DN to history. 25.8.2.3.  Report  (03).    Collects  meal  charges  for  the  specified  period  and  creates  a history DN entry. 25.8.2.4.  Correct  (05).    Reimburses  and  refunds  all  previous  deductions  taken  during the  period  input.  May  be  for  a  variable  open  or  history  entry.  Processes  in  any  status except “V”.  If there are any PI entries with dates within the start and stop date of the DN entry, the PI entries must also be canceled. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 395  25.8.2.5.  Cancel  (06).    Cancels  the  open  or  closed  entry  and  creates  a  new  open  or closed entry. The cancel process must take place prior to the report or start process.  May be used for an open or history DN entry. 25.8.3.  Retro  Collection  of  Meal  Charges.  For  those  members  whose  meal  charges  should have  been  withheld  from  their  pay,  but  were  not,  meal  charges  must  be  collected retroactively.  There are three options for accomplishing these retroactive collections: 25.8.3.1.  Submit  a  DN01  with  the  retro  date.   This  will  create  a  sizeable  meal  charge for the period  of uncharged days.   Please note, once the DN01 is  submitted, the  system will collect the whole DN amount all at once from the member’s pay. 25.8.3.2.  Submit a DN03 for each month (i.e. DN03 for 1-31 Jan, 1-28 Feb, etc.).  This process  will  require  multiple  input  by  your  office  and  manual  tracking  of  the  amount collected/amount  due,  but  will  prevent  the  large  collection  from  one  paycheck  and provide a better audit trail. 25.8.3.3.  Calculate  the  actual  meal  charge  amount  and  submit  a  DS01,  type  9,  for  the meal  charge,  prorating  the  collection amount, using the  D company  code  of the FSO  or the dining facility if the dining facility has one established.  The problem with this option is  that the  system  does not recognize the  collection as a replacement  for the DN and, if there was a later requirement to refund some part of the collected amount, the PI03 would not process because there would be no DN on the record.   See  paragraph 25.2.8 above for action to take when the duty location is a pipeline training location. 25.9.  Missed  Meals  Refunds  (FID  PI):  PI  entries  will  be  posted  as  history  entries  on  the record.    There  may  be  multiple  PI  entries  for  any  one  DN  entry  (see  Figure  25.6  for  PI transaction format). 25.9.1.  Report (03).  Creates a history PI entry.  NOTE:  There  must  be a corresponding DN entry on the MMPA. 25.9.2.  Correct  (05).    Cancels  an  existing  PI  entry  and  creates  a  new  closed  entry  as appropriate. 25.9.3.  Cancel (06).  Cancels a corresponding PI entry. 25.10.  Family  Subsistence  Supplemental  Allowance  (FSSA):  Effective  1  May  2001,  Air Force  members  may  apply  for  FSSA,  a  non-taxable  supplemental  subsistence  allowance.  Once the  member  completes the application it must go to the Commander (or a Commander on G-Series orders with command responsibility) for approval.   The Commander’s support staff is responsible for the FSSA computation prior to the Commander’s approval of the allowance. 25.10.1.  Source  Document.    The  DD  Form  114,  Military  Pay  Order,  that  is  received  from the Commander’s Support  Staff and  certified by the Commander, is the  source  document to pay FSSA.  Submit the DD Form 114, with your quarterly source document submissions, to the DFRC.  Ensure you keep the FSO-retained copy. 25.10.2.  Initiating Payment.  To start (or change) FSSA payments, send an email with a copy of  the  DD  Form  2857,  DD  Form  114,  and  an  EXCEL  spreadsheet  (with  the  information listed in paragraph 25.10.3 below), to AF/A1PA via the MAJCOM.  Once the FSSA request has been validated and approved, AF/A1PA will contact DFAS to initiate payment. 396 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 25.10.2.1.  (DELETED) 25.10.2.2.  (DELETED) 25.10.2.3.  (DELETED) 25.10.2.4.  (DELETED) 25.10.3.  EXCEL spreadsheet data.  Include the following data on the EXCEL spreadsheet: 25.10.3.1.  Member’s full name 25.10.3.2.  Member’s social security number (SSN) 25.10.3.3.  Effective date (of start, stop or change) 25.10.3.4.  Dollar amount of FSSA payable to member in whole dollars 25.10.3.5.  Number in household 25.10.3.6.  Member’s grade 25.10.3.7.  FSSA household location (CONUS/OCONUS) 25.10.4.  Stopping FSSA.  To stop FSSA base level FSOs need to notify DFAS-DE via CMS case; be sure to include the stop date in the case. 25.10.5.  Additional  information.    DFAS-JM/DE  will  process  the  allowance  start,  for members  who  have been identified by the 15th of the month, in time to have the allowance included  in  the  member’s  end  of  month  pay.    Submissions  received  after  the  15th  will  be reflected  in  the  next  month’s  EOM  pay.  FSSA  will  be  reflected  on  the  MMPA  as  an  "09" entry,  FID 40.  Spreadsheets  must  be compiled and sent on a monthly basis to arrive before the 15th to minimize the email traffic at central site. 25.10.6.  Members  arriving  PCS.    When  a  member  arrives  PCS,  the  gaining  FSO  is responsible for notifying DFAS-DE, via CMS, of the date arrived on station.  DFAS-DE will stop the FSSA effective the  day prior to the date of arrival at the new  station.  The member may  reapply/re-certify  at  the  new  duty  station  through  the  same  process  discussed  in subparagraph 25.10.2 and 25.10.3 above. 25.10.7.  Promotions.   When  a  promotion  is  processed  on  a  member  who  is  receiving FSSA, DFAS-DE will  stop the allowance effective the day prior to the effective date of the promotion.  If  the  member  questions  why  the  allowance  stopped,  send  him/her  to  the commander for information concerning reapplication. 25.10.8.  Re-certification.  Re-certification follows the same procedures as initial application.  Members must re-certify under the following circumstances (if member participates in other income assistance programs, notification of those agencies is necessary as well): 25.10.8.1.  Annually.  Members  are  required  to  re-certify  their  FSSA  entitlement  during the period from the 30 days prior to 1 February to 30 days after 1 February. 25.10.8.2.  Any change to  household.   An increase or decrease to household  size may affect amount of entitlement. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 397  25.10.8.3.  When monthly income increases by $100 or more, as compared to the current certified  amount.    Increases  in  income  less  than  $100  per  month  will  not  affect entitlement. 25.10.8.4.  When  promoted,  eligibility subparagraph 25.10.7 above.  Members must certify to restart entitlement to FSSA. the  allowance terminates. for   See  25.10.8.5.  When  a  member  goes  PCS,  FSSA  will  terminate  the  day  prior  to  the  date member officially checks into the new duty station.  See subparagraph 25.10.5 above. 25.10.9.  Overpayments. for  FSSA  overpayments.  Overpayments  are recouped  directly  from  military  pay.    These  procedures  are  to  remain in place until DJMS-AC is changed to allow processing of the entitlement by the FSO. accountable   Member is 398 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 25.1.

Introduction.  The  Joint  Federal  Travel  Regulation  (JFTR),  defines  the  various  types  of BAH  payable  to  a  member.    In  general,  BAH  provides  members  a  monthly  allowance  for housing.    BAH  consists  of  Partial  BAH,  BAH-I,  BAH-Transit  (BAH-T),  BAH-Difference (BAH-DIFF),  BAH-RC,  Overseas  Housing  Allowance (OHA),  Family  Separation  Housing-Overseas (FSH-O), and FSH-B. 26.1.1.  Partial BAH formerly called Partial BAQ. 26.1.2.  BAH-I consists of the former allowances known as BAQ and VHA. 26.1.3.  BAH-T was established on January 1, 2006. 26.1.4.  BAH-DIFF formerly called BAQ-DIFF. 26.1.5.  OHA remained unchanged (Chapter 30). 26.1.6.  FSH-O  consists  of (paragraph 26.28). 26.1.7.  FSH-B  consists  of (paragraph 26.28). the former  allowance  Dual  OHA  and  FSA-Type I  the former  allowances  Dual  VHA  and  FSA-Type  I  26.1.8.  BAH-RC was established on January 6, 2006. 26.1.9.  BAH-II  was  eliminated  on  January  1,  2006.   BAH-II  was  removed  from  the  OHA computation on October 1, 2005. 26.2.  Entitlement  Overview.  All  BAH  types  are  intended  to  offset  or  defray  actual  housing (mortgage or rental)  costs;  they are not intended  to  cover 100%  of these  costs.    See  the JFTR,  Chapter 10, for actual entitlement provisions and conditions, unless otherwise indicated within this paragraph. 26.2.1.  Partial  BAH.   Partial  BAH is payable to  members  without dependents  who reside in  single-type  government  quarters.    Partial  BAH  cannot  be  paid  with  any  other  BAH entitlement.  Partial BAH rates are found in the Defense Joint Military Pay System (DJMS) Table 019.   Partial BAH is processed using Format Identifier (FID) 35. 26.2.2.  BAH-I.  BAH-I is designed to offset a portion of the housing expenses incurred by, and as a result of, members and/or their dependents living in non-government quarters within the United States (U.S.), to include Hawaii and Alaska. 26.2.2.1.  BAH-I  rates  are  based  upon  grade,  dependency  status  (with  or  without dependent) and each location’s adequate housing costs.   These rates are developed from housing  data  collected annually  from  the  uniformed  services  under  the  auspices  of  Per Diem, Travel and Transportation  Allowance Committee (PDTATAC).  The results of the survey determine the rates payable for specific geographic areas.  To determine the rates for  each  duty  station,  data  is  aggregated  into  a  collection  of  ZIP  codes  or  Military Housing Areas (MHA).  Each grade and  dependency  status  within a MHA is assigned a BAH-I  rate.    If  a  member  feels  the  BAH-I  rate  for  a  particular  area  is  insufficient  to 416 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 adequately  defray the  housing  costs  (i.e. increase in  housing  costs),  the  following  steps may be taken for re-consideration by the PDTATAC; 26.2.2.1.1.  Member informs unit commander. 26.2.2.1.2.  Unit  commander  prepares  a  letter/memorandum  to  the  local  Mission Support or Civil Engineering Commander requesting reconsideration. 26.2.2.1.3.  The  letter  is  forwarded  from  the  Mission  Support  or  Civil  Engineering Commander  to  the  local  FSO,  from  the  FSO  to  the  appropriate  major  command (MAJCOM),  and  from  the  MAJCOM  to  AF/A1PA,  1040  Air  Force  Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040.  The MAJCOM should also send an informational copy to  AF/A7CAH,  1260  Air  Force  Pentagon,  Washington  DC  20330-1260  or AFILEH.Workflow@pentagon.af.mil. 26.2.2.2.  BAH-I rates are found in DJMS Table 59; DJMS Table 61 must be used first to acquire the MHA Index number for a particular location. 26.2.2.3.  The BAH-I rate  payable  is typically  based upon the location of  the  member’s Permanent  Duty  Station  (PDS).   For  a  member  with  dependents,  the  rate  payable  for dependents  may  be  based  on  the  MHA  where  the  dependents  reside;  see  the  JFTR,  Chapter 10, for complete details. BAH-I is processed using FIDs 35 and 68. 26.2.3.  BAH-T.  BAH-T is designed to offset a portion of the housing expenses incurred by, and  as  a  result  of,  members  and/or  their  dependents  living  in  non-government  quarters.   BAH-T rates are based upon  grade and dependency  status; they  do  not include adjustments for  local  housing  costs,  and  are  found  in  DJMS  Tables  007  (without-dependent  rate)  and 008 (with-dependent rate).  BAH-T is  processed using FID 35.  BAH-T is paid to members in a travel status on a Permanent Change of Station (PCS) when: 26.2.3.1.  The  member’s  losing  PDS  is  located  outside  the  continental  United  States (OCONUS). 26.2.3.2.  The  member  is  in  the  accession  pipeline,  which  includes  ROTC,  USAF Academy graduates, and OCS, and travel is between Initial Entry  Training (IET) sites to the first PDS. 26.2.4.  BAH-DIFF.    BAH-DIFF  is  designed  for  members  who  live  in  unaccompanied personnel  housing  (UPH)  (barracks  or  dormitories),  pay  child  support  and  have  no  other qualifying  dependent(s).  Members  are  entitled  to  receive  BAH-DIFF  as  long  as  the  support amount  paid  is  at  least  the amount  of  the  BAH-DIFF  rate payable  for  the  member’s  grade.  The member’s  BAH-DIFF  will  automatically  stop  if,  due  to  a  mass  rate  change  or  the  member’s promotion, the support amount paid falls below the BAH-DIFF rate.   BAH-DIFF rates are found in  DJMS  Table  028.    BAH-DIFF  cannot  be  paid  in  conjunction  with  Partial  BAH,  BAH-I  or other with-dependent rate entitlements.  BAH-DIFF is processed using FID 36. 26.2.5.  OHA.  OHA is designed to offset a portion of the housing expenses incurred by, and as a result  of,  members and/or their dependents living in  non-government  quarters  outside  the U.S.  OHA rates are established by the PDTATAC, and are based upon the member’s grade, dependency  status,  housing  expenses  and  the  location’s  adequate  housing  costs.   See  the Joint  Federal Travel  Regulation (JFTR), Chapter 9 and appendix K for actual entitlement provisions, conditions and computation steps.  OHA is processed using FIDs 35 and 43. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 417  from 26.2.6.  FSH-O.  FSH-O is designed to offset a portion of the housing expenses incurred by, and  as  a  result  of,  a  member  living  in  non-government  quarters  outside  the  U.S.  and geographically  separated their  dependents.  Government  quarters  must  be unavailable,  dependent  travel  must  not  be authorized at government expense to  either  the PDS or a nearby location, and the dependent(s) must not live at or in the vicinity of the PDS. See  the  JFTR,  U10414  and  Appendix  K  for  actual  entitlement  provisions,  conditions,  and computation  steps.   FSH-O  rates  are  based  upon  the  member’s  grade,  dependency status, housing  expenses  and  the  location’s  adequate  housing  costs.   FSH-O  rates  can  be  found  in DJMS Table 007.  FSH is processed using FID 45. 26.2.7.  FSH-B.   FSH-B is designed to offset a portion of the housing expenses incurred by, and  as  a result  of, a  member  with dependents living in non-government  quarters  within  the U.S.  and  geographically  separated  from  dependents.    Government  quarters  must  be unavailable,  dependent  travel  must  not  be  authorized  at  government  expense  to  either  the PDS or a nearby location, and the dependent(s) must not live at or in the vicinity of the PDS.  FSH-B  rates are  based upon  grade, dependency  status and each location’s adequate housing costs.  See the JFTR, U10414, for actual entitlement provisions and conditions.  FSH-B rates are equivalent to the BAH-I without-dependent rates for the same location.  FSH-B rates are found in DJMS Table 59; DJMS Table 61 must be used first to acquire MHA Index number for a particular location.  FSH-B is processed using FID 67. 26.2.8.  BAH-RC.  BAH-RC is designed to offset a portion of the housing expenses incurred by,  and  as  a  result  of,  reserve  component  members  and/or  their  dependents  living  in  non-government  quarters.  BAH-RC  is  authorized  when  no  other  housing  allowance  (i.e.  BAH, OHA) is authorized (paragraph 26-27).  BAH-RC rates are based upon grade and dependency status;  they  do  not  include  adjustments  for  local  housing  costs,  and  are  found  in  DJMS Tables  007  (without-dependent  rate)  and  008  (with-dependent  rate).    BAH-RC  is processed using FID 35. 26.2.9.  Advanced  Payment  of  BAH  (paragraph  26.29).    An  advance  payment  may  be paid at any time during a member’s assignment at a PDS.  A member may receive an advance for  dependent  housing  expenses  and/or  for  his/her  own  housing  expenses  at  an unaccompanied  location.    An  advance  payment  of  BAH  is  payable  upon  request  of  a member  when approved  by the  member’s unit  commander or housing officer.  (Members in the  grade  05  or  above  may  approve  their  own  requests.).  The  advance  may  be  paid  to  an eligible  member  to  meet  extraordinary  expenses  in  obtaining  or  occupying  other  than government quarters. in  26.3.  Responsibility  Overview.

All member s  must  immediately  notify  the  FSO  and  MPF  of  all  dependency  status  changes (marriage, divorce, child support, death, birth, government quarters assignment/termination, etc.). Failure to support a dependent, on whose behalf BAH is claimed, will result in non-entitlement to BAH.  A member is also not entitled to BAH on behalf of a dependent  whose  whereabouts are unknown.    A  false  claim  or  statement  against  the  United  States  Government  is  punishable  by court  martial.    The  penalty  for  willfully  making  a  false  statement  or  claim  is  a  maximum  of $10,000 or maximum imprisonment of 5 years or both (18 U.S.C. 287).  NOTE: If a member is uncertain about support requirements, the member should seek advise from the local Staff Judge Advocate.   Complete  form preparation requirements are outlined  in Tables  26.1  and  26.2, and the  AFMAN  65-116  Vol  2,  chapter  5,  unless  otherwise  indicated  within  this  paragraph.

The  FSO certifies all  AF Form 594 applications,  except those relationships or dependency  claims  that  require  DFAS-IN  determination  (paragraph  26.7)  and  those done  for  recertification  where  there  is  no  change/action  needed  (see  chapter  32  for recertification requirements) .  Where local procedures allow, HMO a pproval on the form may constitute adequate authorization without FSO certification. 26.5.2.  DD Form 114 may be prepared by the authorized agency/individual, in place of the AF  Form  594.  See  Tables  26.1  and  26.2  for  specific  situations  where  this  form  may  be substituted.

Supporting  documents  should  be  obtained  from  the  official  state  or foreign  country  agency  responsible  for  registering  such  actions.  If  supporting documents cannot be obtained within a reasonable period,  such as a delay  caused by the official  state  agency,  alternate  documentation  may  be  used  temporarily.    If  it  is impractical  or impossible to  obtain  supporting  documents, alternate documentation  may be  used  permanently.    Examples  of  sufficient,  alternate  documents  include  hospital  or church records signed by the record’s custodian. 26.6.1.2.  Legal name change documents when appropriate. 26.6.1.3.  English translation of required supporting documents when appropriate. 422 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.6.1.4.  Any other documentation pertinent to the claim may be submitted. 26.6.2.  Primary  dependency  claim  requirements.    These  requirements  are  specific  to  the type of primary claim submitted, and are in addition to the requirements outlined in 26.6.1. 26.6.2.1.

The validity of the marriage will be  determined at  base level  with the assistance of  the local  Staff Judge  Advocate (SJA) (paragraph 26.7.1).  However, when information is received that indicates a marriage is void or annulled, then it is a purported marriage for pay purposes, and must be treated as outlined in paragraph 26.6.4.7. 26.6.2.2.  Dependent  Child  Not  in  Member’s  Custody.    The  requirement  to  pay  child support  and  the  amount  thereof  must  be  documented  by  a  divorce  decree,  legal separation  agreement,  court  order  and/or  a  statement  signed  by  both  the  member  and the  custodian  of  the  child  on  whose  behalf  the  support  is  paid.   The  signed  statement must be notarized, identify the amount received, and indicate the custodian’s willingness to  accept  such  support  payments  from  the  member.   The amount  paid  must  be  at  least equal  to  the  BAH-DIFF  rate  for  the  member’s  grade.   The  signed  statement  should be submitted in conjunction with the appropriate legal document when the legal document: 26.6.2.2.1.  Is silent on dependent support. 26.6.2.2.2.  Does not state an amount of dependent support. 26.6.2.2.3.  Absolves the member of dependent support responsibilities. 26.6.2.2.4.  Requires an amount less than the BAH-DIFF rate for the member’s grade. 26.6.2.3.  Dependent  Child is Terminated.

The  member  must  provide  the  original,  or  a  certified  copy  of  the original,  court  order,  decree,  written  agreement,  etc.  stating  that  the  child  will  reside with member for more than 90 days.  This document is used to start member’s BAH-I at the with-dependent rate, unless member resides in housing.  Entitlement can be started at the beginning of the 90-day period.  If, after the fact, it is determined that the dependent did not stay the full 90 days, process the stop retroactive to the start date. 26.6.3.  Secondary  dependency  claim  requirements  (general).  These  requirements  must  be met for all secondary dependency claims, and are in addition to the requirements outlined in paragraph 26.6.1. 26.6.3.1.

Written verification of the dependent’s income, from all sources, is required. 26.6.3.4.  Proof  of  the  member’s  support,  such  as  canceled  checks,  money  order receipts  or  a  dependent  support  allotment,  is  required  on  all  BAH  claims  when  the dependent does not reside in the member’s household. 26.6.3.5.  The appropriate dependency statement  must  be  completed,  signed by member, signed by the dependent or dependent's guardian, and notarized. 26.6.4.

The  incapacity  must  have  existed on a continuous  basis since  before  age  21  (or  while  in  a  student  status)  for  USIP  card  privileges  and  BAH entitlement.  This form is also used for USIP card applications for incapacitated students. 26.6.4.4.  Full-time  Student  21-22  Years  of  Age.

The parental relationship must  have  existed  for a continuous  period  of not less than  5  years  before  the  member’s  emancipation.    Supervision  of  the  activities  of  a child or the administration of the estate by an adult other than a biological parent is not sufficient  to  establish  an  in  loco  parentis  relationship.  Acting  as  custodian,  legal guardian,  or  nurse  also  does  not  establish  an  in  loco  parentis  relationship.  A  person in loco parentis to the member’s spouse is not eligible for any entitlement.  Persons standing in loco parentis to the member are not eligible for USIP cards. 424 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.6.4.6.1.  As  proof  of  an  in  loco  parentis  relationship,  signed  and  notarized affidavits  from the service member, claimed dependent and two disinterested persons who have knowledge of the in loco parentis relationship to the member are required. 26.6.4.6.1.1.

If by written agreement, furnish a copy. 26.6.4.6.1.1.6.  The  affidavit  must  include  information  such  as  whether  the claimed  dependent  exercised  full  parental  control,  planned  educational training, and used personal funds for support of the member.  If another person provided support to the member, explain. 26.6.4.6.1.2.  Affidavits from two disinterested persons must include: 26.6.4.6.1.2.1.  Date relationship started. 26.6.4.6.1.2.2.

How long the relationship lasted. 26.6.4.6.1.2.5.  Any periods after the relationship started when the member did not live in the claimed dependent’s household. 26.6.4.6.1.2.6.  The  various  ways  the  claimed  dependent  performed  the duties  and  responsibilities  of  a  parent,  such  as  supervision,  education, financial support, etc. 26.6.4.6.1.2.7.

Explanation  of  the  circumstances  that  led  to  the  in  loco  parentis relationship. If by written agreement, furnish a copy. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 425  26.6.4.6.1.7.  The affidavit must include information such as whether the claimed dependent  exercised  full parental  control,  planned  educational training, and used personal funds for support of the member.  If another person provided support to the member, explain. 26.6.4.6.2.  Affidavits from two disinterested persons must include: 26.6.4.6.2.1.  Date relationship started. 26.6.4.6.2.2.

How  the  persons  completing  the  affidavit  acquired  personal knowledge of the in loco parentis relationship. 26.6.4.7.  Purported Marriages. When information is received that indicates a marriage is void  or  annulled,  then  it  is  a  purported  marriage  for  pay  purposes.  A  BAH  claim  for  a spouse  or  child of a  purported  marriage  (that  is,  void  or  annulled  marriage)  should  be sent  to  DFAS-JMOB/DE  for  determination  of  the  validity  of  the  marriage  and  or retention of payments of BAH already made. The FSO compiles and sends: 26.6.4.7.1.  Copies  of  legal  documents  relating  to  the  marriage,  such  as  a  marriage certificate, annulment decree, divorce decree and birth certificate for any child of the purported marriage are required. 26.6.4.7.2.  A  separate  transmittal  document  explaining  the  circumstances  that invalidated  the  relationship  and  any  other  supporting  documents  that  the  member provides.  DFAS-JMOB/DE  performs  a  review  of  the  relationship  and  will  provide written notification to the FSO and to the member. 26.6.5.  Evidence or Claims of Non-Support. Evidence or claims of non-support and requests for  support  made  by  a  member’s  dependent  or  someone  acting  on  behalf  of  a  dependent may be sent to the appropriate FSO or directly to DFAS-JMOB/DE. 26.6.5.1.

When any of the events outlined in 26-6.e.1 occur, the FSO must review  the  member’s  BAH  entitlement(s)  for  possible  start,  stop  or  recoupment  action.  The FSO will: 26.6.5.2.1.  Contact the member to determine if support is being furnished. 26.6.5.2.2.  Inform  the  member  that  the  JFTR,  Chapter  10,  requires  recoupment  of BAH  paid  to  members  who  did  not  support  dependents  on  whose  behalf  BAH  was claimed, and that the member’s BAH  entitlement at  the  with  dependent rate  will  be stopped  and  recouped  for  the  entire  period  unless  the  member  proves  adequate support was provided. 26.6.5.2.3.  Review  all  documentation  (divorce  decree,  support  agreement,  etc.)  to determine how much support was required. 26.6.5.2.4.  Review  all  documentation (cancelled  checks,  money  orders, affidavits  from  dependents,  allotments,  etc.)  to  determine  how  much  support  was actually provided. 26.6.5.2.5.  Change  the  BAH  at  the  with  dependent  rate  to  appropriate  BAH  (i.e.,  BAH at  the  without  dependent    rate  or  Partial-BAH)  for  the  period(s)  that  the member cannot prove adequate support was provided. 26.7.  Relationship  or  Dependency  Determinations.  The  completed  AF  Form  594, applicable  dependency  statement  and  all  supporting  documents  are  forwarded  to  the  FSO.  The  FSO  examines  the  AF  Form  594,  dependency  statement  and  supporting  documents  to ensure that the requirements of paragraph 26.6  are  met and a  determination  of relationship  or dependency  for  BAH  purposes  can  be  made.    See  JFTR,  chapter  10,  Part  B,  for  complete relationship and dependency definitions, rules. 26.7.1.  Local  FSO  Determinations  (Primary  Dependents).    The  FSO,  or  designated representative,  determines  relationship  or  dependency  per  paragraph  26-6  when  BAH  is claimed  on  behalf  of  a  lawful  spouse  or  unmarried  children  under  21  years  of  age   (this includes children born out of  wedlock, adopted or step-children). 26.7.1.1.  Any  questions  as  to  the  legal  sufficiency  of  such  documents  should  be referred  to  the  local  SJA  for  determination  of  the  documentation's  legal  sufficiency  to establish such birth or marriage. 26.7.1.2.  On the basis of documentation submitted, and after the local SJA determination of legal  sufficiency, if appropriate, the  FSO  verifies relationship  of  spouse  and  children, or both. 26.7.1.3.  The  FSO  returns  the  documents  (or  copies)  to  member  unless,  after  the local  SJA  review,  doubts  still  exist  about  their  legal  sufficiency.    In  that  case,  process claim as prescribed in paragraphs 26.7.2, 26.6.4.7  and 74.2.2.4 of this volume. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 427  the  member, included 26.7.2.

Children  born  out  of  wedlock  and  under  21  years  of  age  (USIP  card privileges only, BAH entitlement determined locally (paragraph 26.7.1)). 26.7.2.3.  Incapacitated  children  over  21  years  of  age,  including  incapacitated  students  21-22 years of age. 26.7.2.4.  Full-time  students,  21-22  years  of  age.  If  only  an  ID  card  is  requested,  no dependency  determination is  sent to DFAS. Member provides  documentation to MPF to get or renew ID card. 26.7.2.5.  Ward of the court. 26.7.2.6.  In loco parentis (No USIP card privileges). 26.7.2.7.  Legally questionable claims/Purported Marriages. 26.7.3.  Upon  completion  of  dependency  determination,  DFAS-JMOB/DE  notifies  the member, FSO, and MPF of determination results. 26.7.3.1.  When required, a DD Form 139 is completed by DFAS-JMOB/DE and sent to the member’s servicing FSO, to start, stop, or change BAH, as appropriate. Upon receipt of the DD Form 139, the FSO: 26.7.3.1.1.  Annotates the DD Form 1863. 26.7.3.1.2.  Processes the required action via DJMS. 26.7.3.1.3.  Acknowledges receipt on, and returns, the AF Form 1209. 26.7.3.2.  The member receives a copy of the DD Form 139 and a letter advising of the determination.    In  cases  that  require  debt  establishment,  the  letter  begins  the  member’s due process. 26.7.3.3.  In  cases that require a retroactive  stop  or reduction in  entitlement, DJMS  will establish a debt based  on  the retroactive  nature of  the reduction and  suspend  collection action  pending  due  process.    The  FSO  provides  due  process  in  accordance  with Chapter  70  of  this  regulation  and JFTR, paragraph 500104.A.2 prior to  processing the DQ20 to resume debt collection. 26.8.  Secondary Dependent BAH Dependency Re-determinations. 26.8.1.  DFAS-JMOB/DE,  Dependent  Entitlements  Branch,  performs  the  annual  review of BAH re-determination applications for members who claim 26.8.1.1.  Parents, parents-in-law, stepparents, parents-by-adoption 26.8.1.2.  Incapacitated  children  over  21  years  of  age,  including  incapacitated  students  21-22 years of age 428 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.8.1.3.  Full-time students, 21 and 22 years of age 26.8.1.4.  Ward of a court 26.8.1.5.  In loco parentis 26.8.2.  Note that on initial applications the member is stating current facts.  The approval of an  initial  claim  authorizes  the  FSO  to  start  and  make  retroactive  payment(s)  of  any  BAH claimed.    Although  it  authorizes  the  FSO  to  start  this  entitlement,  it  does  not  substantiate future  payments  or  confirm  that  the  “in  fact”  dependency  requirements  are  still  being  met. This  is  accomplished  via  a  required  annual  re-determination.    In  addition  to  annual  re-determinations,  re-determination  s  must  also  be  accomplished  on  PCS,  or  entry/exit from  government  quarters.   Re-determinations  are  performed  to  ensure dependency  existed and  entitlement  continued  without  interruption  since  the  date  of  the  initial  or  last  re-determination.    The  re-determination  also  allows  continued  receipt  of  BAH.    The member  is  advised  at  the  time  of  approval  when  the  annual  re-determination  must  be performed.   See Figure 26.7 for the schedule of annual re-determinations. 26.8.3.  The  month  before  the  re-determination  is  due,  a  letter  is  sent  to  the  member,  by DFAS-JMOB/ DE, instructing the member to resubmit the required forms for the dependency test. 26.8.4.  When  a  member  submits  his  or  her  re-determination  package,  the  FSO annotates to  DFAS-JMOB/DE, using AF Form 1209. the  DFAS-DE  Form  1863,  and immediately  mails the  package 26.8.5.  A  member’s  failure  to  provide  required  documents  to  the  FSO  will  cause  BAH  to be terminated.  If a member fails to submit the package by the end of the month in which the forms are due, the FSO: 26.8.5.1.  Stops BAH at the with-dependent rate, effective the last day of the month 26.8.5.2.  Starts BAH at the appropriate without-dependent entitlement, effective the next day. 26.8.5.2.1.  For  example,  if  a  member's  re-determination  is  due  in  September,  stop the  higher  rate  of  the  allowances  effective  30  September.    Start  the  appropriate lower rate effective 1 October. 26.8.5.3.  Prepares  an  AF  Form  594  to  substantiate  the  change,  and  annotates  on  the form,  “member  failed  to  submit  a  re-determination  package”.  Normal  AF  Form  594 distribution and retention procedures apply. 26.8.5.4.  Notifies  the  member that  collection action  will  be  taken  effective  the  date  of the last re-determination. 26.8.5.5.  Provides the  member  due  process; if after 60 days, if the  FSO  has nothing to indicate  the  collection  would  be  incorrect,  processes  a  DQ  to  collect  the  overpayment over 12 months. 26.8.6.  If the member provides the re-determination package late, the FSO: 26.8.6.1.  Ensures  the  procedures  outlined  in  paragraphs  26.8.3  and  26.8.4  were followed. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 429  26.8.6.2.  Does not restart the higher rate of the allowance. 26.8.7.  If  the  delay  was  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the  member's  control,  a  statement from  his  or her  commander  mu st  be  included  with  the  r e-deter mination  package  for consideration  by DFAS-JMOB/DE. 26.8.8.  An  AF  Form  594  is  required  on  every  re-determination  sent  to  DFAS-JMOB/DE. Failure to include this form could result in collection action. 26.8.9.  Upon  completion  of  the  re-determination,  DFAS-JMOB/DE  notifies  the  member, FSO, and MPF of determination results as outlined in paragraph 26.7.3. 26.9.  Re-certification.  For re-certification policy and procedures see Chapter 32. 26.10.  Verification  of  Family-Type  Government  Quarters  Assignments.  To  prevent erroneous  payments  of  BAH  to  members  assigned  to  adequate  and  inadequate  family-type government quarters: 26.10.1.  Upon  receipt  of  notification  that  the  quarterly  BAH/ACES  bump  is  available  on Report.Web,  the  MAJCOM  distributes  the  various  base-level  reports  to  each  of  its  bases. Finance provides a copy of appropriate reports/lists to the local housing office for review. 26.10.2.  Within 5 business days, the housing office validates the data and submits whatever changes  are  needed,  either  to  their  records,  or  to  DJMS.  If  DJMS  requires  change,  the housing office provides the original AF IMT 594 and transmittal log or a new AF IMT 594 will be retroactive to  the  date BAH  payments  should  have  been  stopped.  Once  the  reviews are complete, necessary pay adjustments are made. 26.10.3.  By the established suspense date, MAJCOM notifies AFAFO that the reconciliation is complete. 26.10.4.  The HMO's listing of housing assignment includes the name of both members when husband and wife are military members. 26.10.5.  If  a  member  appearing  on  the  HMO  listing  is  not  serviced  by  the  local  FSO  and has dependents living in government quarters at the local base, the local FSO determines the member's current servicing FSO and if BAH was paid during the time period that government quarters were provided to the dependents. 26.10.5.1.  If  the  member  received  BAH  during  the  time  the  dependents  were  provided government quarters: 26.10.5.1.1.  The  local  FSO  notifies  the  member's  servicing  FSO  by  message, identifying the dependents,  and  the  correct  fair rental value  when  inadequate  government  quarters were provided. the  date  government  quarters  were  provided the  member, 26.10.5.1.2.  The  servicing  FSO  determines  whether discontinued, and if so, stops the BAH. the  BAH  should  be 26.10.5.1.3.  The  servicing  FSO  establishes  a  debt  to  recoup  overpayments  when necessary.  The  FSO  provides  due  process  in  accordance  with  Chapter  70  of  this regulation and JFTR, paragraph 500104.A.2 prior to processing the DQ20 to resume debt collection. 430 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.10.6.  Fair rental value automatically updates when BAH rates change, unless member-to-member  marria ge  is    involved.      In  that  ca se,  a  UG  mana gement  notice  is  issu ed for  rate  cha nges  (CLOST-BAH-DEPN-CODE=  I  and  W)  and  the  FSO  verifies  and adjusts fair rental value for both members. 26.10.7.  Upon  completion  of  the  verification  (at  the  45-day  suspense  date  or  earlier  if directed  by  the  MAJCOM)  the  FSO  notifies  their  MAJCOM  that  the  verification  is complete and necessary corrections were made. 26.11.  Verification  of  Single-Type  Government  Quarters  Assignments.  To  prevent erroneous  payments  of  BAH  to  members  assigned  to  single-type  government  quarters,  FSO works  with  HMO  to  ensure  members  who  are  assigned  to  single-type  quarters  are  receiving partial rate BAH. 26.11.1.  For  those  members  identified  by  housing  as  no  longer  assigned  to  single-type quarters, the HMO provides an AF Form 594 showing termination date. Similarly, for those members HMO identifies as being assigned to single-type quarters, HMO provides the FSO with AF Form 594 including assignment date. 26.11.2.  The FSO provides the Housing office chief a list of personnel residing in UPH: Not receiving  Partial  Rate  BAH,  Receiving  BAH  DIFF,  Receiving  BAH  (FID  68),  Assigned Family Housing; this is  the "Base  Dormitory Report". Within 5 business  days, the Housing office  chief  will  validate  the  data  and  submit  changes  in  BAH  authorization,  using  the original AF IMT 594 and transmittal log. If an AF IMT 594 does not exist, the action dates on  the  new  AF  IMT  594  will  be  retroactive  to  the  date  BAH  payments  should  have  been stopped. 26.11.3.  The  HMO  and  the  units  are  jointly  responsible  to  ensure  that  members  on  the without-dependent  rate  list  are  not  assigned  single-type  government  quarters.    The  HMO prepares an AF Form 594, and  forwards it to the  FSO,  when  members are erroneously  paid BAH  at  the  without-dependent  rate.  The  HMO  should  process  all  quarters  assignments  or terminations within 5 days. 26.11.4.  The  FSO  verifies  Partial  BAH  manually.    The  FSO  uses  the  lists  to  identify members not receiving Partial BAH and not living in family-type government quarters.  The members  that  are  not  assigned  to  family-type  government  quarters  (see  above)  may  be eligible  for  Partial  BAH.    Mismatched  SSNs  are  researched  and  an  AF  Form  594  is prepared for each member entitled to Partial BAH. 26.12.  Dependency  Discrepancy  Reconciliation.  A  reconciliation  between  data  contained  in DJMS and the Military Personnel Data System (MILPDS) is conducted semi-annually to identify discrepancies.  The  reconciliation produces three reports that are used to verify  members' BAH entitlements.  The reports are: PCN:   UH099C0471 - Officer/Enlisted Dependency discrepancies (Figure  26.8);  PCN:   UH099C081  -  Mil-Mil  BAQ  Same  ADSN-Central-Site  Match  (Report No.1)  (Figure  26.9);  and  Mil-Mil  BAQ  Different  ADSN-Central-Site  Match  (Report No. 2) (Figure 26.10). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 431  26.12.1.  Receipt of the reports. The reports are made available to each FSO via SAR. DFAS-JMPBC/  DE  sends  a  message  to  the  network  once  the  reports  are  available.  A  report  of the  members  who appeared on the prior report is also included. The date on the message is used to set a 45-day suspense date for completion and return to DFAS-JMPBC/DE. The FSO forwards one  copy  of these  reports  to the  MPF  for  action.  These  reports  are  a  priority  and the discrepancies must be corrected as soon as possible. 26.12.2.  Performing the Review. 26.12.2.1.  PCN:  UH099C0471.  Discrepancies between the Closest Dependent Code  for BAH  in  DJMS-AC  and  the  Marital  Status  Code  in  Military  Personnel  Date  System (MilPDS). 26.12.2.1.1.  Compare  the  PCN:  UH099C0471  to  available  information  and annotate  the report  with  the  information  found,  indicating  which  database  needs to  be  corrected  (i.e.,  DJMS,  MILPDS,  neither).    For  example,  if  one  member  is coded  with  a  BAH  Closest  Dependent  Code  of  A  and  MILPDS  shows  a  code  of annulled  (A),  divorced  (D),  legally  separated  (L),  single  (S)  or  widowed  (W),  then suspect that there has been an overpayment of BAH to this household. 26.12.2.1.2.  Entries  with  an  MPF  Dependency  Code  of  “S”  and  DJMS  Closest Dependent Code of “C” are not valid discrepancies and should be disregarded. 26.12.2.2.  PCN:   UH099C081  Report  No.  1  and  Report  No.  2.   These  reports  identify possible overpayments of BAH at the with-dependent rate. the  BAH for  members  whose  records 26.12.2.2.1.  Stop indicate  possible overpayments.    For  example,  when  one  member  is  coded  with  a  BAH  closest dependent code of A, B, C or W and the spouse is coded A, B, W or BAH-DIFF, then suspect  that there has  been an  overpayment of  BAH,  even  though  the  members  do not  reside  together.   If  both  members  are  residing  together  and  receiving  BAH  at the  with-dependent  rate  for  the  same  household,  stop  only  the  junior  member's entitlement.    When  a  member's  entitlement  is  stopped,  the  regular  supporting documentation is required to restart the BAH. 26.12.3.  Follow-up to determine if a debt should be established due to overpayment. 26.12.3.1.  Obtain  the  information  necessary  to  resolve  the  discrepancy  in  the  usual ways  -  personal interview, telephone, FAX, letter, or by having the member complete an AF Form 594 or AF Form 987, Re-certification of Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ), Overseas  Housing  Allowance  (OHA),  Family  Separation  Allowance  (FSA),  and  Cost-of-Living Allowance (COLA) (Figure 32.1).  If a member does not respond to the initial inquiry  within 10 days,  contact  the  member’s unit.  If advised that the member is unable  to  report  to  the  FSO  (on  leave,  temporary  duty  (TDY),  etc.),  request  the  unit provide an expected return date. 26.12.3.2.  Minor,  non  pay-affecting  discrepancies  do  not  require  immediate  action against  the  Master  Military  Pay  Account  (MMPA).  Annotate  the  report  and  count  the discrepancy  as  a  DJMS  error.    Ensure  follow-up  is  done  to  correct  them  in  a  timely manner. 432 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.12.3.3.  If members provide information or documentation to support the entitlements reflected  in  their  pay  accounts,  instruct  the  members  (to  include  both  spouses  when military  members  are  married)  to  go  to  the  MPF  to  have  the  necessary  changes  made, annotate the report accordingly, and count the discrepancy as a MILPDS error. 26.12.3.4.  If  member  resides  in  government  quarters  and  his  or  her  Closest  BAH Dependent  Code  is  incorrect,  prepare  and  process  a  DD  Form  114  with  a  statement explaining the changes needed, ensure the member's name, SSN, incorrect (current) code and the correct code is included.  (See Figure 26.15 for change transaction.) 26.12.4.  Preparation  of  DFAS-DE  Form  2429  (HAF-ACF  (SA)  8502)  (Figure  26.11).  Account for the total number of errors identified by the reports, by category, on the DFAS-DE  Form  2429  (i.e., DJMS, MILPDS, other).  Errors include those that cannot be corrected immediately  because in  paragraph 26.12.2. is  unavailable  as  well  as the  member those identified 26.12.5.  Distribution  of  Reports  and  DFAS-DE  Form  2429.    After  the  reports  have  been annotated  with  all  discrepancies  discovered,  the  FSO  forwards  the  DFAS-DE  Form  2429, with  the  list  of  names  and  SSN  of  those  members  whose  records  in  MILPDS  require correction, to the MPF  for action.  The MPF  corrects the  MILPDS records, countersigns the DFAS-DE Form 2429, and returns it to the FSO. Upon receipt of the DFAS-DE Form 2429 from the MPF, the FSO makes a copy of the annotated listings and the DFAS-DE Form 2429 for  FSO  retention,  then  mails  the  originals  to  DFAS-JMPBC/DE,  6760  E.  Irvington  Pl., Denver CO 80279-3000, with a copy to the MAJCOM.  Ensure DFAS-JMPBC/DE receives the annotated reports and the completed DFAS-DE Form 2429 by the suspense date. 26.12.5.1.  Advise  the  MPF  of  the  purpose  of  this  review  and  request  the  return  of  the listing, with Marital Status Code corrections annotated, in sufficient time for the FSO to meet the DFAS-DE suspense.  It is essential that the FSO and MPF coordinate to resolve and  prevent discrepancies.  If  a  member  reports  to  the  FSO  or  MPF  to  change  Marital Status  or Dependency  code,  whichever office the  member reports  to opens a CMS  case and refers it to the other for update to the other system. 26.12.5.2.  Each  time  a  member  makes  a  dependency  status  change  in  either  DJMS  or MILPDS,  a  notice  is  printed  with  MPF  daily  processing.    If  the  change  was  in  the MILPDS,  a  listing  titled  "MPF/FMF  Marital  Status  Interface  Transaction  Register"  is printed addressed to the FSO.  Upon receipt,  ensure  a  corresponding  change  is  made  to DJMS.    If  the  change  was  in  DJMS,  a  listing titled  "Notice  of  Dependency  or  Marital Status  Change”  is  printed.    MPF  should  ensure  a  corresponding  change  is  made  to  the MILPDS. 26.13.  Assignment/Termination  of  TLF.  TLF,  or  other  transient  type  facilities  are  not considered  government  quarters  for  BAH  purposes.  Accordingly,  they  have  no  impact  on  a member’s BAH entitlement. 26.14.  BAH  Entitlement.  Paragraphs  26.15 through  26.27  provide  explanation  of entitlement  conditions  for  some commonly  misunderstood  scenarios.   These  paragraphs  do not supersede,  but  are  intended  for  use  in  conjunction  with,  the  JFTR,  chapter  10.  For  complete explanation of these and other BAH entitlement conditions see JFTR, chapter 10. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 433  26.15.  BAH Entitlement-New  Accessions.  Newly  inducted,  enlisted  or  re-enlisted  members, officers,  and  officer  candidates  with  dependents  are  entitled  to  BAH-I  effective  the  date  of enlistment or entry on active duty and continuing through the day before the member arrives at his/her initial  PDS.  The rate is based on the location of the dependents.  In instances where the member’s  dependents  reside  at  a  location  outside  the  U.S.,  the  rate  is  based  on  the  member’s training location.   A member without dependents is authorized BAH-T, and only during periods of travel between duty/training sites and his/her initial PDS. 26.16.  BAH  Entitlement-Dependent  Child  in  Custody  of  Someone  Other  Than  Member (Entitlement  Started  before  5  Dec  1991).  Members  assigned  to  single-type  government quarters and  receiving BAQ at the  with-dependent rate  on December 4, 1991, solely  by reason of child support payment, continue to be entitled to such entitlement on behalf of this dependent until  another  dependent  is  acquired  on  whose  behalf  BAH  may  be  claimed  or  the  member completes a PCS move on or after 1 Jan 1998, whichever is first. 26.17.  BAH Entitlement-Member in  a Non-pay Status.  See  JFTR,  chapter  10,  for  payment standards and limitations. 26.17.1.  Unauthorized Absence.   The dependents  of a  member in  pay  grade E4 (4 years  or less service) or lower are entitled to continue receipt of the member’s BAH entitlement while the member is in a non-pay status for a maximum of 60 days. 26.17.1.1.  Request  for  Payment.  Request  for  payment  of  BAH  may  be  made  by  the dependent  on  whose  behalf    BAH  is  claimed  or  by  dependent's  fiduciary  or  custodian.  Such request  must be in  writing and  worded  essentially:   "I, (name),  (capacity in  which request  is  made--spouse,  fiduciary,  custodian)  (if  fiduciary  or  custodian  show  name  on whose  behalf  payment  is  requested),  request  payment  of  Basic  Allowance  for  Housing against  the  account  of  (member's  name,  grade,  SSN)  who  entered  an  unauthorized absence status (describe status) on (date)."  The FSO assists claimant to the extent possible in preparing the request for payment.  Upon receipt of a request for payment, which is, in the  FSO  opinion,  of  doubtful  propriety,  full  particulars  should  be  furnished  to  AF/  DPDF  via  the  MAJCOM  by  priority  email.    AF/DPDF  determines  the  validity  of the request for payment and advises the FSO by priority email. 26.17.1.2.  Documentation  Required.    The  request  itself  is  the  only  documentation required to establish dependent's entitlement provided official Air Force records indicate the  requestor  is  the  dependent  or  acting  on  the  dependent’s  behalf.  Official  Air  Force records  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  AF  Form  594  and/or  enrollment  in  Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). 26.17.1.3.  Amount Payable.  Payment is made at the rate credited to the member at the time  the  absence  commenced.    Payments  include  accrual  from  the  first  day  of unauthorized  absence  through  date  of  payment,  not  to  exceed  2  months  total.  Subsequent payments are made, if necessary, as  of  the  end  of the 2 month period  or  the date the  member  returned  to  military  control, whichever comes first. 26.17.1.4.  Payment Procedures.  The FSO: 26.17.1.4.1.  Computes payment due dependent 26.17.1.4.2.  Prepares DD Form 1351-6. 434 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.17.1.4.3.  Submit a PD03 for each payment. 26.17.1.4.4.  Submits a 3503 for each period paid, along with the appropriate housing transaction (6803 or 4303) to reinstate BAH  for  the  period  of  unauthorized  absence covered by the above payment.  One or two 3503s may be submitted.  When one 3503 is submitted, it must be  for at least 30 days and  cannot exceed 60 days.    When two 3503s are submitted, each must be for 30 days. 26.17.2.  Members in Pretrial Confinement in a Foreign Country: 26.17.2.1.  For  enlisted  members  in  pay  grade  E4  (4  years  or  less  service)  or  lower, payment  is authorized  for a period  not to  exceed 2  months.  For any additional  months, there must be a showing of hardship on the dependent and approval is on a case-by-case basis by AF/DPPC. 26.17.2.2.  For  enlisted  members  in  pay  grade  E4  (over  4  years  of  service)  and  above, there must be demonstrated hardship on the dependent and approval is on a case-by-case basis by AF/DPPC. 26.17.2.3.  See  26-17.a  subparagraphs  (1)  through  (4)  for  request,  documentation,  and payment requirements. 26.17.3.  Member in Excess Leave Status.  BAH may be paid to a member in pay grade E4  (4  years  or  less  service)  or  below,  with  dependents,  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  2  months during which an excess leave status exists, unless member is not expected to return to duty (Examples:   A ppellate  leave  or  commandant's parole).   Management Notice-X803, Notice of  BAQ  Stop--Excess  Leave,  is  sent  to  the  FSO  via  JDC  when  a  member  enters an  excess leave  status.  The  FSO  computes  2-month  period  from  first  day  of  excess  leave.    To authorize  BAH  for  period  of  excess  leave,  the  FSO  submits  a  3503  for  each  period  of entitlement. 26.18.  BAH  Entitlement-BAH  Rate  Protection.  BAH  Rate  Protection  is  designed  to  avoid reductions in a member's housing allowance when the member's actual costs remain unchanged.  26.18.1.  While  on  station  within  the  United  States:    BAH  Individual  Rate  Protection  is maintained and BAH shall not be reduced as a result of changes in MHA, or national, costs or promotion of the member.  BAH Rate Protection is lost if there is a change in status of the member,  including  demotion,  member  moving  out  of  current  MHA,  Permanent  Change  of Station (unless waiver approved) or a  change in dependency status. 26.18.2.  Upon  PCS:    A  member  may request BAH Rate Protection  via  waiver.   BAH Rate Protection  waivers  must  be  applied  for  through  the  servicing  MPF  and  approved  by AF/A1PA. The following conditions warrant waiver consideration: 26.18.2.1.  Low  Cost/No  Cost  Moves.    With  an  approved  waiver,  a  member  with  or without  dependents,  reassigned  incident  to  a  low  cost/no  cost  move  within  the  U.S.,  is entitled to continue receipt of BAH at the old PDS rate.  See Figure 26-31 for the format to use when requesting a waiver for Low Cost/No Cost Moves. 26.18.2.2.  PCS  to  Attend  Professional  Military  Education  (PME).    A  member  with dependents,  assigned  PCS  to  attend  PME,  technical  training,  or  career  education  for  12  months  or  less,  may  request  a  waiver  to  the  normal  BAH  policy.    This  waiver,  if approved,  allows  the  member  to  receive  BAH  for  a  location  other  than  the  PDS  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 435  (PME location).  The member may elect to receive BAH at the rate for the new PDS, old PDS  or the  dependent's location if the  member  does  not  have an  old PDS.  A  waiver  is not required if the  member  elects to receive  the  new  PDS rate, as it is the rate payable upon  arrival  in  the  absence  of  an  approved  waiver.    If  approved,  the  FSO  uses  the approval letter, amended orders indicating limited PCS entitlements, and AF Form 594 as support  for  payment.    If  approved,  the  FSO  ensures  reimbursement  for  TLE,  DLA  and per  diem  are  still  paid  at  the  single  rate.    See  Figure  26-30  for  the  format  to  use  when requesting a waiver for PME/Technical Training. 26.18.2.3.  Dependent  Restricted/Unaccompanied  Tours.    A  member  with  dependents, assigned  PCS  to  an  unaccompanied  tour  overseas,  is  entitled  to  continued  receipt  of BAH-I at the old PDS rate if all of the following conditions exist: 26.18.2.3.1.  Prior  to  PCS,  member  and  dependent(s)  occupied  a  residence  within a MHA other than that of the old PDS. 26.18.2.3.2.  The dependent(s) do not relocate. 26.18.2.3.3.  The MHA rate for this area is lower than the old PDS rate. 26.18.3.  If  the  member  is  entitled  to  rate  protection  under  this  paragraph,  the  gaining  FSO processes  a  6801  using  the  ZIP  Code  of  the  old  PDS  after  the  SG03  transaction  has processed.  If  the  member  is  not  entitled,  the  gaining  FSO  processes  a  6801  or  6804  using the ZIP Code of the dependent’s residence. 26.19.  BAH  Entitlement-Dependents  Remain  Overseas  (DRO)/Housing  Waivers.  A n a p p r o v e d DRO, or housing  waiver (JFTR,  U10208), authorizes  continued receipt  of  overseas housing  allowances  (OHA)  or  BAH  for  Hawaii  or  Alaska.    It  does  not  authorize  a  second, separate  or  “dual”  housing  allowance.    An  approved  DRO  is  for  a  specified  time  period.  Continued receipt of  overseas allowances, BAH and/or COLA  stop at  the  end of this  specified period.    NOTE:  An  approved  DRO  does  not  supersede,  or  otherwise  make  obsolete,  the entitlements  authorized  as  a  result  of  a  dependent-restricted  assignment  and  certain unaccompanied assignments. 26.19.1.  Example  1:    A  member  with  an  assignment  to  Lakenheath  AFB  (OCONUS) received an approved DRO for his dependents in Germany.  The member would continue to receive  with-dependent OHA  for Germany  while on assignment  to England, and  would  not receive a separate (or dual) entitlement for himself. 26.19.2.  Example  2:    A  member  with  an  assignment  to  Bolling  AFB  (CONUS)  has received an approved DRO for his dependents in Germany.  The member would continue to receive  with-dependent  OHA,  and  would  not  receive  a  separate  (or  dual)  entitlement  for himself. 26.19.3.  Example  3:    A  member  with  an  assignment  to  Bolling  AFB  (CONUS)  has received an approved DRO  for  his dependents in Hawaii or  Alaska.  The  member would continue  to  receive  with-dependent  BAH  for  Hawaii  or  Alaska,  and  would  not  receive  a separate (or dual) entitlement for himself. 436 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.20.  BAH Entitlement-Early Return of Dependents (ERD). 26.20.1.  ERD.  An approved ERD authorizes movement of command-sponsored dependents from a location OCONUS prior to the issuance of PCS orders.  An ERD may be requested by the  member  or  directed  by  the  member’s  command.    If  an  ERD  is  approved,  and transportation costs are  paid  by the government, the ERD authorizes  BAH-I  or OHA at the with-dependent  rate  based  upon  the  dependent’s  location  in  addition  to  any  without-dependent rate BAH entitlements the member is authorized. This includes FSH-O or FSH-B  if  otherwise  eligible.    If  the  government  does  not  pay  transportation  costs,  the  dependents movement  is  not  considered  an  ERD  for  entitlement  purposes.    Accordingly,  with-dependent OHA for the PDS continues. to  a  dependent 26.21.  BAH Entitlement-Designated Location Moves (DLM).  A  DLM  may  be requested  in conjunction  with  a  member’s  assignment restricted/unaccompanied assignment.   An approved DLM authorizes  dependent relocation at  government  expense.  This is  in  addition  to  any  without-dependent  rate  BAH  entitlements  the  member  may  be  authorized as  a  result  of  the  dependent  restricted/unaccompanied  assignment.  If  dependents  relocate  at personal expense from a designated place in a BAH area to a different location in a BAH area that is  not at  or near the  member’s  PDS,  continue BAH based  on the previously authorized location (either  old  PDS  or  dependent  location  before  the  move).  If  the  dependents  relocate  from  a designated  place  in  an  OHA  area  to  a  location  in  a  BAH  area,  start  BAH  based  on  the  new location  on  the  dependents’  arrival  date  and  stop  the  OHA  the  day  prior  to  dependents’ departure. 26.22.  BAH Entitlement-Member in TDY or PCS Status. 26.22.1.  TDY  station  changed  to  PDS.    This  includes  members  hospitalized  or  on terminal  leave.  When  a  member  receives  PCS  orders  while  hospitalized,  on  emergency leave,  or  TDY,  the  member’s  entitlement  to  BAH-I  at  the  new  PDS  is  based  upon  the effective date of orders. 26.22.2.  TDY (PCS  not involved).   A  member  on TDY receives BAH-I  or OHA  based on the PDS. 26.22.3.  TDY En Route PCS.  These rules apply to members with or without dependents. 26.22.3.1.  A  member  departing a  PDS  within  the  U.S.,  with TDY  en  route, is entitled to  the  BAH-I  rate  paid  at  the  member’s  old  PDS  until  the  member  reports  at  the  new PDS. 26.22.3.2.  A member departing a PDS outside the U.S., with TDY en route, is entitled to BAH-T until the member reports at the new PDS. 26.22.4.  A  member  who  is  in  receipt  of  PCS  orders,  whose  dependents  depart  the  PDS  in advance  of  the  member,  may  be  entitled  to  a  housing  allowance  based  on  either  the dependents’  location  or  the  new  PDS,  with  approved  Secretarial  waiver.    See  paragraph 26.18 for information concerning application for Secretarial waiver. 26.22.5.  Indeterminate TDY (I-TDY).  A member on I-TDY orders (Extended Deployment) may  be authorized to  move his/her  dependents to another location  for  the  duration  of the I -TDY.    The  dependents  will  receive  dependent  orders  which  authorize  movement  of household goods (HHG) at government expense.  In these cases, members are authorized the AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 437  BAH/OHA for the dependent location for the duration of the I-TDY (Extended Deployment).  See JFTR, Vol 1, chapter 10 for more information. 26.23.  BAH  Entitlement-New  Claims  Prior  to  Separation.  If  a  member  acquires  a dependent  within  90  days  prior  to  separation  and  attempts  to  claim  BAH,  but  is  unable  to produce  the  necessary  supporting  documents,  the  member  may  later  submit  a  claim  (Chapter 74). 26.24.  BAH Entitlement-Terminal Leave. 26.24.1.  A member who enters terminal leave status is authorized BAH-I for the full period of terminal leave at the old PDS rate.  Exceptions to this rule include: 26.24.1.1.  A member on an unaccompanied tour, with dependents in the U.S., who enters terminal  leave  from  a  PDS  outside  the  U.S.,  is  authorized  BAH-I  at  the  rate  for  the dependent’s location for the period of terminal leave. in 26.24.1.2.  A  member the  U.S.,  with  dependents  authorized  by  Secretarial determination  to live away  from  the  member’s PDS,  who enters terminal  leave  status is authorized BAH-I at the rate  for  the  dependents  location  for  the  period  of  the  terminal leave. 26.24.1.3.  A  member  on  an  accompanied  tour  or  a  member  without  dependents,  who returns to the  U.S.  for  separation/retirement  processing  is authorized BAH-I at the  rate for  the  separation activity.  This  rate  continues  for  the  period  of  terminal  leave,  starting with  arrival  at  the  separation  activity.  This  also  applies  to  members  under  the  same circumstances,  who  are  authorized  BAH  at  the  with-dependent  rate  because  they  are paying child support. 26.24.1.4.  A  member  who  returns  to  the  U.S.  after  completing  separation/retirement processing OCONUS is authorized BAH-I for the leave address. 26.24.1.5.  A  member  who remains OCONUS is authorized OHA provided the  member obtained private sector housing. 26.25.  BAH  Entitlement-Death  of  Member.  When  a  member  dies  while  on  active  duty, BAH  may  be authorized  on  behalf  of  dependents  for up to 365 days after the  member’s death (paragraph 54.6). 26.26.  BAH Entitlement-Inadequate  Quarters.  Effective January 1, 2006, members assigned to inadequate quarters are paid BAH-I at the applicable with or without dependent rate; however, regardless of the amount or type of BAH-I received, the  fair rental charge will not  exceed 75% of  the  BAH-I  with-dependent  rate.  NOTE:  As  a  result,  the  fair  rental  charge  may  exceed  the member’s actual BAH-I entitlement. 26.27.  BAH  Entitlement-Members  of  Reserve  Components.  Effective  January  6,  2006, members  of the reserve components called to active duty, for other than contingency operations, and for more than 30 days are entitled to BAH-I at the rate prescribed for the location from which they are called to active duty  beginning on the  first active duty day.  A  member  called to active duty, for other than a contingency operation and for 30 days or less  is entitled to BAH-RC. 26.28.  FSH-O and FSH-B.  FSH-O/FSH-B is payable under the following conditions: adequate government  quarters  are  not  available  for  the  member’s  assignment,  the  member’s  dependents 438 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 do not live at or near the PDS and dependent travel was not authorized at government expense to the PDS or a nearby location. 26.28.1.  DD Form 1561.  The back of the DD Form 1561 may be used to provide required information and  certificates as  outlined  within this  paragraph.    When using  the back  of the form, the member or FSO, notes on the front that data appears on the back.  The FSO ensures one copy of the member’s signed tour election is attached when starting or continuing FSH-O/FSH-B. 26.28.1.1.  Member requests transportation of dependents before departure. 26.28.1.1.1.  Submit  DD  Form  1561,  modified  as  appropriate,  to  substantiate payment  of  FSH-O/FSH-B  when  a  member  requests  transportation  of  dependents before member’s departure, and: 26.28.1.1.1.1.  Request is approved but dependents do not travel with member, or 26.28.1.1.1.2.  Member’s management file for future reference. request is temporarily  denied.  File  denial in 26.28.1.1.1.2.1.  In the case of denial, the member indicates on the back of the form the date of new application for transportation of dependents, or reason(s) why member has not applied.  FSO includes reason for, and date of, denial of member’s prior request. 26.28.1.1.1.2.2.  When  applicable,  fully  explain  on  back  why  delay  in furnishing dependents’ transportation exceeds 60 days from date of approval for entry. 26.28.1.2.  Temporary  Absence  of  Dependents.  If  member  maintained  a  common household  with  dependents  before  PCS  or  TDY,  but  all  dependents  were  or  are temporarily away from that residence for vacation, hospitalization, to attend school, etc., member  must  furnish  complete  explanation.    Include  length  of  absence  and  whether member  continued  to  maintain  residence.    If  a  sole  dependent  is  in  an  institution, include a copy of the court order or appropriate medical statement showing that period in such institution is not expected to exceed one year. 26.28.1.3.  Dependents Visit Member receiving FSH-O/FSH-B.  If a member is visited at the  PDS  by  all  dependents,  member  must  certify  date  of  their  arrival,  purpose,  and expected length of visit. After they depart, member must certify date of departure and, if more than three months from date of their arrival, reason for extension of visit. 26.28.1.4.  Evacuation.   When  dependents  are  evacuated  under  provision  of  the  JFTR U5246,  officer  directing  the  evacuation  must  certify  that  it  was  not  caused  by dependents’ misconduct in order for FSH-O/FSH-B to accrue. 26.28.1.5.  ERD.  See paragraph 26-20. 26.28.1.6.  Overseas  Separation.  When  a  member  separating  overseas  starts  terminal leave  within  CONUS  and  it  is  questionable  that  the  member  will  return  to  the  point  of separation,  stop  FSH-O.  If  the  member  returns,  the  FSO  submits  a  6503  to  adjust member’s pay. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 439  26.28.2.  DD  Form  114.    When  stopping  FSH-O  for  a  member  who  changes  election  to “with  command-sponsored  dependents”  after  arrival  at  PDS,  attach  one  copy  of  the Headquarters (HQ) United States Air Force (USAF) determination, that change of election is in the best interest of the Air Force. 26.28.3.  See JFTR, U10414 for further conditions of entitlement to FSH-O/FSH-B. 26.29.  Advance Payment of BAH.  An AF Form 1039 is prepared by the member to request an advance payment of BAH. 26.29.1.  Conditions of Entitlement: 26.29.1.1.  An  advance  payment  of  BAH  is  payable  upon  request  of  a  member  when approved by the  member's unit  commander  or  the  housing  officer.  The advance is  paid to  an  eligible  member  to  meet  extraordinary  expenses  in  obtaining  or  occupying other  than Government housing. Extraordinary expenses include the following: 26.29.1.1.1.  Advance rent. 26.29.1.1.2.  Security deposits. 26.29.1.1.3.  Installation fees. NOTE:  Extraordinary "moving in" expenses should be reflected in applicable blocks 4a, 4b, and 4c of AF Form 1039. Block 4d "other" should not be used. 26.29.1.2.  The purchase of personal property needed to occupy non-government housing may  be  authorized  for  an  advance  payment  of  BAH,  but  is  limited  to  those  items necessary  for  occupancy  and  must  be  reasonable  in  nature.    The  guide  to  be  used  to determine the amount of the advance a member may receive for the purchase of personal property  is  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  32-6004,  Attachment  8,  plus  major  appliances. Attachment 8 lists the items that the government would furnish if the items were available or if government housing were assigned. 26.29.1.3.  Additional  advances  covering  housing  needs  may  be  approved  at  any  time for  valid  reasons  as  determined  by  the  approving  authority.    Outstanding  or  unpaid advances  remaining  upon  authorization  of  an  additional  advance  may  be  added  to  the new advance amount and a new repayment schedule established. 26.29.1.4.  The  amount  of  the  advance  must  not  exceed  the  anticipated  housing expenses,  or  the  total  of  three  months  BAH  expected  to  be  accrued  by  the  member, whichever  is  less.  When  making  determinations  involving  member  to  member marriage  or  other  members  sharing  arrangements,  the  combined  advance  requests, allowances, and expenses of the occupants  must  be considered. 26.29.1.5.  Home  Buyers.    An  advance  for  home  purchase  is  limited  to  expenses anticipated  or  required  for  utilities  and  initial  expense.  It  is  not  authorized  for  home purchases, a  down payment  toward  buying  a  house,  closing  costs,  upgrades  or  similar costs.    Authorized  expenses  include  costs  for  installing  220  volt  electrical  wiring necessary  for stoves or  clothes dryer and utility deposits required to acquire service. 26.29.2.  Disbursement  of  the  Advance.    Except  in  extenuating  circumstances  (determined by  member's  unit  commander  or  designee),  disbursement  of  the  advance  normally  must 440 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 not  be  made  more  than  three  workdays  before  the  date  payment  must  be  made  under  a lease  or  rental  agreement.    For  personnel  at  a  duty  location  not  having  a  local  payment office, the advance may be paid earlier than three days before lease or rental payment is due because of mail or transportation schedules.  The disbursement must be made within 30-days after  occupancy.  This  30-day  period  allows  a  member  sufficient  time  to  move  in  and determine  any  extra  cost  associated  with  the  new  quarters  that  was  not  readily  apparent before  taking  occupancy.    When  circumstances  warrant,  a  waiver  of  the  30-day  period may  be  approved  by  the  unit  commander  upon  written  request  from  the  member.    The request  must  state  the  reason  for  the  delayed  advance  and  show  that  the  funds  are  needed to  meet advance rent, security deposits or initial expenses.  Approved request is attached to the payment voucher. 26.29.3.  Repayment of the Advance: 26.29.3.1.  Repayment  of  the  advance  will  usually  be  required  in  12  equal  monthly installments. When justified by the member and approved by the member’s commander, the payment  may be extended beyond 12 months to  preclude any undue hardship on the member.   If  a  member  is  on  a controlled tour, the repayment  period  may  equal  the tour length, but may not exceed it.  If a member is not serving a controlled tour, the repayment period  may  not  exceed  24  months.  The  member  must  provide  an  AF  Form  2451, Financial Statement, to substantiate the hardship. 26.29.3.2.  In all cases, the repayment period must not exceed the member's DOS.  When a  lease  is  not  completed  for  which  an  advance  has  previously  been  paid,  the  advance must be repaid in full immediately. 26.29.3.3.  Collection  of  the  advance  will  begin  on  the  first  day  of  the  month  after payment of the advance has been made.   When justified by the member and authorized by  the  member's  commanding  officer  or  designee,  start  of  collection  action  may  be postponed for up to three months. 26.29.4.  The  FSO uses  AF Form 265, FSO  Payment  Authorization (JUMPS), to authorize payment  for  local  payees  (Figure  35.1).    The  Electronic  Funds  Transfer  (EFT)  payment request/authorization  form  will  be  used  to  authorize  payments  for  central  payees.  The  AF  Form  1039  is  attached  to  the  original  AF  Form  265  or  a  copy  of  EFT  payment request/authorization  form  depending  on  which  one  was  used.    For  requests  to  extend repayment  periods,  made  subsequent  to  the  advance,  the  AF  Form  1039  is  attached  to  the Document  Transmittal  Listing  (DTL)  for  submission  to  the  Federal  Records  Center  as support for the request.  Copies of the AF Form 1039 are distributed as follows: 26.29.4.1.  Original - attached to payment voucher/EFT form or DTL (as applicable). 26.29.4.2.  Second copy - member. 26.29.4.3.  Third copy - approving official. 26.29.4.4.  Fourth copy - FSO hold copy. 26.29.5.  Special actions required by the FSO: 26.29.5.1.  When  a  repayment  postponement  has  been  authorized  by  the  member’s commander, the number of months delay is entered in the PA03 transaction. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 441  26.29.5.2.  When  a  member  receives  an  advance  for  dependent  housing  expenses  and also  for  his  or  her  housing  expenses  at  an  unaccompanied  overseas  location,  the  FSO must  process  a  separate  voucher  and  PA03  or  JPBB  for  each  advance.    If  delayed repayment is approved, include  that information  in the appropriate transactions.  These transactions  will  send  the  member’s  money  to  his  or  her  bank  account  and  report  the payment  on  his  or  her  MMPA  systematically.    Transactions  in  both  cases  (local  and central  payees)  must  reflect  the  proper  ADV-PAY-CTGYS  codes  as  contained  in Attachment 4 of this manual. 26.29.5.3.  The  FSO at bases  where  a  member  has received an advance and  dependents are residing  (member  leaves  family  at  old  station  for  which  an  advance  was  received) while  member  is  serving  an  unaccompanied  tour  overseas  should  be  aware  when  such situations exist and make lump  sum  collection of any unpaid advance if  member  does not  return  to  duty  station  where  dependents  are  located  upon  completion  of unaccompanied  tour.    Take  lump  sum  collection  action  if  notified  that  dependents change  locations  or  if  member  is  scheduled  for  separation  prior  to  repayment  of  the advance. 26.29.5.4.  Review  approved  AF  Form  1039  to  ensure  that  the  number  of  months approved  for  repayment  will  not  exceed  the  member's  tour  length  or  date  of  separation (DOS).   Review  member's MMPA  when receiving  PCS notice  or  during out-processing and take necessary action to collect any unpaid advance prior to PCS or separation.  For additional information  on repayment  schedules and  extending or  postponing collections, see JFTR, Volume I, chapter 10, and Table 30-1 of this volume. 26.30.  BAH  Transaction  Format  Identifiers  and  Action  Indicators.  Transactions  may  be input  by  member's  servicing  Input  Station  Identifier  (ISI),  TDY  ISI,  or  losing  ISI  (if  Date Departed Last Duty Station (DDLDS) in the SH is within the last 35 days of DFAS-DE processing date).  BAH  is  paid  using  combinations  of  the  following  FIDs:    35  (BAH-I,  BAH-T,  and BAH-RC,  Figure  26.12  through  Figure  26.17),  36  (BAH-DIFF,  Figure    26.18  through  Figure  26.21),  43  (OHA,  Figure  30.4  and  Figure  30.5),  45  (FSH-O,  Figure  30.8  and  Figure  30.9),  67  (FSH-B,  Figure  26.22  through  Figure  26.25),  and  68 (BAH-I,  Figure  26.26 through 26.30).  The following Action Indicators can be used with these FIDs: 26.30.1.  START (01).  Starts entitlement for an indefinite period 26.30.2.  STOP  (02).    Stops  entitlement  when  a  member  becomes  ineligible  to  receive entitlement. 26.30.3.  REPORT  (03).    Pays  entitlement  for  a  definite  period  with  inclusive  dates  of entitlement. 26.30.4.  CHANGE  (04).    Changes  any  field(s)  in  the  entitlement  open-entry,  which  were formerly correct.  This transaction is not used to correct erroneous entries, it should be used to  merely update the member’s account as his/her dependency status or quarters assignment type changes. 26.30.5.  CORRECT (05).  Corrects erroneous field(s) in the entitlement open entry. 26.30.6.  CANCEL  (06).    Cancels  a  prior  start,  stop,  or  report  entitlement  transaction  and any subsequent entries based on them. 442 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 26.31.  BAH  Management  Notices  and  Leave  and  Earnings  Statement (LES) Remarks.  B A H a n d BAH-DIFF  automatically  stop  the  day  prior  to  the  youngest  child’s 21st  birthday  (BAH-Dependency-Code  =  B,  C,  G,  or  W).    In  the  case  of  a  student  (BAH-Dependency-Code S), BAH  stops the day prior to the  youngest  student’s 23rd  birthday.  Various  management  notices  and  LES  remarks  are  produced  to  provide  the  FSO  and  the member advance notice that the entitlement is about to stop. 26.31.1.  BAH  with-dependents.   Three  35-suspense  entries  and  one  35-future  are  created when  a 3501 is  processed.   These  suspense  entries  generate  management  notices  and  LES remarks, and the future generates the stop action. 26.31.1.1.  XG06  (XG07  if  student)  is  generated  90  days  prior  to  the  child’s/student’s birthday  notifying  the  FSO  that  BAH  will  stop  in  90  days  if  a  3604  is  not  received changing the birthday. 26.31.1.2.  XG03 (XG08 if a  student)  is  generated 30  days  prior  to the  child’s/student’s birthday  notifying  the  FSO  that  BAH  will  stop  in  30  days  if  a  3604  is  not  received changing the birthday. (NOTE:  There is not a Management Notice 60 days prior.) 26.31.1.3.  An  LES  remark  is  generated  30,  60,  and  90  days  prior  to  the  child’s  21st  birthday.  The  remark  states  “Child  will  reach  21  years  of  age  in  (30,  60,  or  90) days; BAH stops day prior to child’s birthdate”. 26.31.1.4.  An  LES  remark  is  generated  30,  60,  and  90  days  prior  to  the  student’s  23rd  birthday.  The  remark  states  “Child  will  reach  23  years  of  age  in  (30,  60,  or  90) days; BAH stops day prior to child’s birthdate”. 26.31.2.  BAH-DIFF.  Three 36-suspense entries and one 36-future entry are created when a 3601  is  processed.    The  suspense  entries  generate  the  following  management  notices  and LES remarks, and the future generates the stop action. 26.31.2.1.  XG04  is  generated  90  days  prior  to  the  child’s  birthday  notifying  the  FSO that BAH will stop in 90 days if a 3504 is not received changing the birthday. 26.31.2.2.  XG05  is  generated  30  days  prior  to  the  child’s  birthday  notifying  the  FSO that  BAH  will  stop  in  30  days  if  a  3504  is  not  received  changing  the  birthday. (NOTE:  There is no Management Notice 60 days prior.) 26.31.2.3.  LES  remarks  are  generated  30,  60,  and  90  days  prior  to  the  child’s  21st  birthday.    The  remark  states  “Child  will  reach  21  years  of  age  in  (30,  60,  or  90) days; BAH stops day prior to child’s birthdate”. 26.31.3.  A  3602  or  3606  will  delete  all  36-suspense  and  36-future  entries  on  the  MMPA when the transaction is processed. 26.32.  BAH  Closest  Dependent  Codes.

Entitlement  provisions  and  types  are  contained  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume 7A, chapter 27. 27.2.  Substantiating Documents: 27.2.1.  Member is required to complete DD Form 1561, Statement to Substantiate Payment of Family Separation Allowance (Figure 27.1). 27.2.2.  FSO  personnel complete certifying officer  portion  of the DD  Form 1561, based  on review of the required evidence.  Attach copies of documentation as indicated below.  Include or annotate, in the certifying  officer's  signature  block  of  the  DD  Form  1561,  the  voucher number,  voucher  date  and DSSN.   Delays of  more than 24 hours at  port  of  departure  such as passport hold, early arrival, etc., should be considered when computing the effective start date. to  DFAS-DE/PMLR  (See  Chapter  2).    There  are  three  types  of  FSA:  FSA-R,  FSA-S,  and FSA-T.   Payment of each type requires specific evidence  attached  to the DD Form 1561. the  normal  document  submission   DD  Form  1561 is  submitted  with 27.2.2.1.  FSA-R. 27.2.2.1.1.

Attach  a  copy  of  the  member's  PCS  order  and  travel  voucher  (DD  form  1351-2).  See paragraph 27.5 for additional guidance pertaining to FSA-R. 27.2.2.1.2.  Member married to another member, no dependents.  Generally, a member married to another member with no other dependents is entitled to FSA-R under the same  conditions as  a  member  with  dependents.     The  members  must  have  resided together  immediately  before  being  separated and the  separation  must  be  a result  of execution of military orders. 27.2.2.1.2.1.  Not  more  than  1  monthly  allowance  may  be  paid  for  any  one month.  Both may be entitled during the same month, but only one may be paid at a  time.    Payment  will  be  made  to  the  member  whose  orders  resulted  in  the separation.  If both  members receive orders requiring departure on the same day, the entitlement goes to the senior member. 27.2.2.1.2.2.  In  cases  where  both  members  meet entitlement  criteria, the  second spouse  may  receive  the  entitlement  upon  termination  of  the  original  spouse’s entitlement.    The  couple  may  qualify  for  sequential  entitlement  to  FSA-R provided their orders keep them continuously separated. 27.2.2.1.2.3.  In order to qualify for a subsequent entitlement to FSA-R, a member to member couple must, once they are no longer separated by orders, reestablish a joint residence. 27.2.2.2.  FSA-S.  The member is on duty aboard a ship, away from the home port of the ship, continuously for more than 30 days. 488 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 27.2.2.3.  FSA-T.   The  member  is  on TDY away  from  the PDS  continuously  for  more than 30 days, and the dependents do not reside at or near the TDY station.  This includes members  who  are  required  to  perform  a  period  of  TDY  before  reporting  to  their initial  station  of  assignment.  Review  the  member's  travel  order  to  determine  location and days of TDY. 27.2.3.  To  stop  FSA,  other  than  at  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  departure,  use  DD  Form  114,  Military  Pay  Order  (Figure  27.2).    Submit  the  original  to  DFAS-DE  in accordance with Chapter 2. 27.3.  Transportation  of  Dependents.  Member  requests  transportation  of  dependents  before departure. Submit DD Form 1561, modified as appropriate, to substantiate payment of FSA when a member requests transportation of dependents before member's departure, and: 27.3.1.  Request is approved but dependents do not travel with member, or 27.3.2.  Member's  request  is  temporarily  denied.  File  denial  in  management  file  for  future reference. 27.3.2.1.

FSO  includes  reason  for,  and  date  of,  denial  of  member's  prior  request.    When applicable,  fully  explain on reverse  why delay  in  furnishing  dependents' transportation exceeds 60 days from date of approval for entry. When using reverse of DD Form 1561, note on face of form that data appears on reverse. 27.4.  Elections and Reelections.  See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, tables 27-1 and 27-4. 27.4.1.  DD Form 1561.   Attach  one  copy  of  member's  signed  election to  serve "all others" overseas tour to DD Form 1561 starting or continuing FSA credit. 27.4.2.  DD  Form  114.    When  stopping  FSA  credit  for  a  member  who  changes  election  to "with  command-sponsored  dependents"  after  arrival  at  permanent  duty  station,  attach  one copy of the HQ USAF determination, that change of election is in the best interest of the Air Force, to the DD Form 114. 27.4.3.  Certificates Required. Reverse of DD Form 1561 may be used for certificates. 27.4.3.1.  Member  maintained  common  household  with  dependents  before  PCS  or TDY  but  dependents  were  temporarily  absent.    If  member  maintained  a  common household  with  dependents  before  PCS  or  TDY,  but  all  dependents  were  or  are temporarily  away  from  that  residence  for  vacation,  hospitalization,  to  attend  school, etc.,  member  must  furnish  complete  explanation.  Include  length  of  absence  and whether  member  continued  to  maintain  residence.    If  a  sole  dependent  is  in  an institution, include a copy  of  court  order  or appropriate  medical  statement showing that period  in  such institution is  not  expected to exceed 1 year.  See DoDFMR,  Volume 7A, chapter 27, for further conditions of entitlement to FSA. 27.4.3.2.  Member receiving FSA away from permanent station more than 60 days.  If a member receiving FSA is away from permanent station for more than 60 days in a TDY, hospital, leave, or confined status, member must certify period (inclusive dates) he or she continued to  maintain  private quarters at  permanent  station  while away.

Member  receiving  FSA-I  or  FSA-II  (PCS)  visited  at  permanent  station  by dependents. If a member receiving FSA-I or FSA-II (FSA-R) is visited at the permanent station  by  all  dependents,  member  must  certify  date  of  their  arrival,  purpose,  and expected length of visit.  After they depart, member must certify date of departure and, if  more than 3 months  from date of their arrival, reason for extension of visit. 27.4.3.4.  Member  entitled  to  FSA-II (TDY) and  dependents  visit at TDY  station  for 30 days or less.  If member is otherwise entitled to FSA-II (FSA-T) and all dependents visit at TDY  station  for 30 days or less, member must certify  date  of their arrival, departure, and that they were merely visiting with no intent to establish a residence. 27.4.3.5.  Advance  Return  of  Dependents.    When  dependents  are  evacuated  under provisions  of  the JFTR, paragraph  U5246,  officer  directing the evacuation  must certify that it was not caused by dependents' misconduct in order for FSA entitlement to accrue. 27.4.3.6.  Overseas  Separation.    When  a  member  separating  overseas  starts  terminal leave  in  CONUS  and  it  is  questionable  that  member  will  return  to  point  of  separation, stop FSA.  If member returns, submit a report transaction to adjust member's pay. 27.4.3.7.  Members  in  a  Pipeline  Status.    Effective  1  Oct  1980,  basic  trainees  and students at a technical training school are entitled to FSA if: 27.4.3.7.1.  They are members with dependents. 27.4.3.7.2.  Dependents are not permitted to travel at Government expense. 27.4.3.7.3.  Dependents do not live at or near the member's training center. 27.4.3.8.  Members  entitled to FSA not associated  with a  PCS  move.   When a  member acquires a dependent not associated with a PCS move, the certifying officer must certify that member qualifies for the FSA entitlement by stating the reason such as "member was married  on                                    (date)  while  on  leave"  or  other  pertinent  statement  that  is applicable.  Place certification  statement on the  reverse  of DD Form 1561.   Annotate in Part  II  "not  applicable,  see  reverse."    If  member  acquires  dependents  while  on  leave, FSA  entitlement  does  not  start until the  day the  member returns to his or her PDS. 27.5.  FSA-R: 27.5.1.  In the case where a member: 27.5.1.1.  acquires  a  dependent  after  the  effective  date  of  PCS  orders  (but  before member's date of departure on subsequent PCS orders), 27.5.1.2.  is not authorized government transportation for the dependent, 27.5.1.3.  and  the  dependent  does  not  live  at  or  near  the  member's  permanent  duty station,  the  member's  entitlement  to  FSA  starts  on  the  date  the  member  acquires  the dependent. 27.5.2.  Effective  January  1,  2002,  when  transportation  of  dependents  is  authorized  at government  expense,  but  the  member  elects  an  unaccompanied  tour  because  a  dependent cannot  accompany  the  member  due  to  certified  medical  reasons,  member  is  entitled  to FSA-R. Secretarial waivers are not needed when documentation of certified medical reasons is  provided, regardless  of the  date on  which the  member  first made the election to  serve an 490 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 unaccompanied  tour.    Prior  to  January  1,  2002,  FSA-R  was  payable  in  this  situation  only pursuant to a secretarial waiver (see DoDFMR, Vol 7A, subparagraph 270301.d). 27.6.  FSA-T.  The  FSA  start  transaction  (6501)  was  modified  for  processing  FSA-T.    This transaction  will  suspend the  start of payment  for 30 days after the effective  start date and only applies  for  FSA-T  for  a  TDY  over  30  days.    The  following  procedures  will  be  used  when processing a 6501-T. 27.6.1.  Using the member’s TDY orders (DD Form 1610 or DTS authorization  showing an assigned six digit authorization number) as authority and backup documentation, the member will certify DD Form 1561, Statement to Substantiate Payment of FSA prior to departure. 27.6.2.  Process  a  6501-T  effective  the  departure  date  obtained  from  the  TDY  orders  (DD Form 1610 or DTS authorization showing an assigned six digit authorization number). 27.6.3.  DJMS-AC  will  recycle  the  transaction  and  create  a  futures  and  release  the  start payment  31  days  after  the  start  date.    The  payment  for  the  allowance  will  be  from  the effective start date and will continue until canceled or stopped by the FSO. 27.6.4.  See paragraph 27.7 below for FSO actions. 27.6.5.  (DELETED) 27.6.6.  (DELETED) 27.6.7.  (DELETED) 27.7.  FSO Action.  Submit FSA transactions when member becomes entitled or when entitlement stops per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, tables 27-1 through 27-4.  FSA type T start transaction cannot be submitted until the member’s date of departure.  FSA type S and T start transactions will not pay until the member has been separated from his/her family for over thirty days, with entitlement back to  date  of  departure.  NOTE:    due  to  the  increasing  number  of  members  who  are  entitled  to FSA-T,  Air  Force  policy  now  requires  that  the  servicing  FSO  (home  station)  input  the  start transaction (6501) at departure, based on the member’s orders to duty for more than 30 days and the member’s completed certification on DD Form 1561. 27.7.1.  Members  with  dependents  must  report  to  finance  prior  to  departing  on  a  TDY projected  for  more  than  30  days.    The  member  must  complete  a  DD  Form  1561,  mark  the applicable blocks in section 8, read the certification statement, and sign and date in block 9. Based  upon  that  certification  and  a  copy  of  the  member’s  orders  (DD  Form  1610  or  DTS authorization showing an assigned six digit authorization number), FSO completes DD Form 114, including the following statement:  “I certify that this member is in receipt of orders for a period of more than 30 days and that  member has completed DD Form 1561.”   Members who do not report prior to departure will be paid FSA, via a report transaction, upon return. 27.7.2.  Attach  a  copy  of  the  orders  (DD  Form  1610  or  DTS  authorization  showing  an assigned  six  digit  authorization  number)  to  the  DD  Form  114  and  use  that  as  the  source document  for  the  6501  transaction  to  start  FSA.    DJMS-AC  will  recycle  the  start  until  the member has been gone for more than 30 days and then generate the pay entitlement, retroactive to the date of departure. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 491  27.7.3.  Attach a  copy of the TDY order (DD Form 1610 or DTS  authorization  showing  an assigned six digit authorization number) to the DD Form 1561 and file in a suspense file until the projected date of return contained in the orders.  On projected date of return, or actual date of  return  if  the  member  comes  back  earlier,  process  the  6502  to  stop  the  FSA  and  sign  the certification  statement  on  the  DD  Form  1561,  using  the  DD  1561,  travel  voucher,  and  the attached order as the supporting documentation for the stop.  Additionally, DD Form 114 may be used to stop the entitlement as soon as you are aware the member has returned; however, the completed  DD  Form 1561 is required to  be  submitted once  the travel  voucher is  completed, with a copy of the DD Form 114 attached.  See paragraph 27.2.3 above. 27.7.3.1.  (DELETED) 27.7.3.2.  (DELETED) 27.7.3.3.  (DELETED) 27.7.3.4.  (DELETED) 27.7.3.5.  (DELETED) 27.7.4.  If the member’s orders were amended, adjust the suspense date accordingly. 27.7.5.  Brief departing  members  on this new  policy, and inform them that  FSA-T  is  based on being TDY for  more than 30 days, reminding them that if they return  before  being  gone for  more than 30 days, the  FSA entitlement  will  be  cancelled and any overpayment, due to late  notification  of  return,  will  be  collected.  Also,  ensure  members  are  aware  that  all amendments must be provided to the FSO. 27.7.6.  Input is shown in Figure 27.3  Transactions are limited to one of these actions: 27.7.6.1.  Start (01).  Establishes entitlement for an indefinite period. 27.7.6.2.  Stop (02).  Terminates entitlement when a member becomes ineligible for FSA. 27.7.6.3.  Report (03).   Credits member with one-time entitlement and is used only with inclusive dates. 27.7.6.4.  Correct (05).  Corrects a previous action submitted with an error. 27.7.6.5.  Cancel (06).  Completely voids a previous submission. 27.8.  FSA-I  was  replaced  by  Family  Separation  Housing  (FSH).

Description.  Cost  of  Living  Allowance  (COLA)  is  designed  to  assist  members  in defraying the excess costs incurred incident to assignment on permanent duty to a station outside CONUS.    Conditions  of  entitlement  to  COLA  are  contained  in  the  Joint  Federal  Travel Regulation (JFTR), Volume I, chapter 9, part B. 28.2.  Substantiating  Document.  FSO  maintains  a  DD  Form  1475,  Basic  Allowance  for Subsistence  Certification,  for  prorated  COLA  to  substantiate  MMPA  update.    The  FSO should  use  AF  IMT  220,  Request  Authorization  and  Pay  Order  Basic  Allowance  for Subsistence (BAS), to  start  or  stop COLA if these actions  correspond  with BAS.  The  AF IMT 220 will contain appropriate comments.  The  FSO uses  DD  Form 114,  Military  Pay  Order,  for COLA  when  not  corresponding  with  BAS  (see  Figure  28.1),  requiring the member to certify number of dependents claimed for COLA purposes on the DD Form 114. 28.3.  FSO Action: 28.3.1.  When    the    member    departs    PCS,    COLA    is    stopped    1    day    before    the  DATE-DEPART-LAST-DUTY-STATION  in  the  PCS  departure  (SH03)  transaction.    The FSO at the new duty station must restart COLA entitlement when a member with dependents is  reassigned  (PCS)  from  a  PDS  outside  CONUS  to  another  station  either  overseas  or CONUS  and  the  dependents  remain  at  the  old  duty  station  where  COLA  is  authorized.  Continuance  of  COLA  at  the  old  station  may  be  authorized  (up  to  60  days)  when  delayed departure of dependents is necessary for reasons beyond the member or dependents' control. Delayed  departure  of  dependents  may  be  authorized  for  reasons  such  as  illness  or hospitalization  of  a  dependent,  completion  of  school  term,  lack  of  adequate  housing  or obtaining  housing  at  new  PDS,  and  so  forth.    The  CONUS  FSO  must  process  a  stop transaction upon departure of the dependents from the overseas station. 28.3.2.  When member is entitled to COLA under provisions of JFTR, paragraph U9100-C4, a separate start transaction, FORMAT-ID 47, is required. 28.3.3.  When  a  member  separating  overseas  starts  terminal  leave  in  CONUS  and  it  is questionable  that  member  will  return  to  point  of  separation,  stop  COLA.  If  member  does return to point of separation, submit a report transaction to adjust member's pay. 28.3.4.  The FSO must have the member certify the number of dependents claimed for COLA on PCS departure.  Adjust member's COLA when applicable. 28.3.5.  Enlisted  members,  without  dependents,  who  reside  in  unaccompanied  personnel housing (the dorm) at a PDS outside CONUS.  If these members have an impracticability or non-availability determination  by the  commander, are  entitled  to  the  full COLA rate,  which is 100 percent  of the  without dependent rate.  FSO is provided a copy of the determination of  impracticability  or  non-availability  for  use  as  supporting  documentation  for  the  0  dependent rate of COLA.  If no such determination has been made, the member is entitled to AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 497  the  barracks  rate,  or  47%  rate,  of  COLA,  because  government  dining  facilities  are considered available. 28.3.6.  Members without dependents who reside in dormitories and are on ESM are entitled to the 47 percent (Bachelor) rate COLA.  These members are coded with NR-DEPN-COLA equal to 9. 28.3.7.  A member does not have to receive BAH on behalf of a dependent in order to receive COLA  on  behalf  of  that  dependent.    The  definition  of  dependent  for  COLA  purposes  is contained  in  the  JFTR,  paragraph  U9000.    A  member  can  be  paid  BAH  on  behalf  of  a spouse,  for  example,  but  have  parents  or  parents-in-law,  etc.,  on  the  orders  and  receive command  sponsorship  for  those  parents.  This  entitles  the  member  to  claim  the  parents  for COLA purposes. 28.3.8.  COLA Computation.  See JFTR, Appendix L. 28.3.9.  Input Format.  Input formats are shown in Figure 28.2 through Figure 28.7. 28.3.10.  Rejects.  See Chapter 4. 28.4.  BAQ Compatibility Edits. the  member’s  open  BAH-II  entry 28.4.1.  If is  without  dependent  rate  BAH-II,  with-dependent  rate  COLA  will  not  process unless  the closest dependency  code is equal  to ‘I’.  The  start  or  report  transaction  will  recycle  until  the  BAH-II  or  BAH-DIFF  entry  is changed or corrected, or the input is modified to agree with the MMPA. 28.4.2.  If  COLA  was  started  as  single  or  bachelor  rate  COLA  (i.e.,  number  of  dependents equal  to  ‘0’  or  ‘9’),  a  change  or  correct  transaction  will  not  update  the  MMPA  to  with-dependent  COLA,  unless  the  closest  dependency  code  is  ‘I’.    The  change  or  correct transaction will recycle until the BAH-II or BAH-DIFF entry is changed or corrected, or the input is changed to agree with the MMPA. 28.4.3.  If the closest dependency code in the 35 entry is G or R, only single or bachelor rate COLA  can  be  paid.  The  start  or  report  transaction  will  recycle  until  the  BAH-II  entry  is changed or corrected, or the input is changed to agree with the MMPA. 28.4.4.  Once  single  or  bachelor  COLA  is  started  it  cannot  be  changed  to  with-dependent COLA,  if  the  closest  dependency  code  in  the  35  entry  is  G  or  R.  The  start  or  report transaction  will  recycle  until  the  BAH-II  entry  is  changed  or  corrected,  or  the  input  is changed to agree with the MMPA. 28.4.5.  Dual COLA (FID 47) cannot be paid if one of the following conditions exist: 28.4.5.1.  There is an open or closed 36 entry on the MMPA. 28.4.5.2.  The closest dependency code in the 35 entry is G, I, or R. 28.4.6.  The  start  or report transaction  will recycle until  the BAH-II  or BAH-DIFF  entry is changed or corrected, or the input is changed to agree with the MMPA. 28.5.  Verification.  FSOs are  provided a monthly listing  of  members  currently drawing COLA and stationed in CONUS.  List should be used to verify COLA entitlement. 498  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Section 28B—CONUS Cost of Living Allowance  (COLA). 28.6.  Description.  CONUS  COLA  is  designed  to  serve  as  a  temporary  reimbursement  for members serving in high  cost areas  in CONUS to partially  offset additional expenses  incurred.  Specific conditions of entitlement are contained in the JFTR, Volume I, chapter 8, part B. 28.7.  Substantiating  Documents.  The  FSO  prepares  DD  Form  114,  Military  Pay  Order,  to start, stop, change, correct, or cancel a member’s CONUS COLA entitlement using FID 51. 28.8.  Eligible  Members.  Payment  of  CONUS  COLA  is  based  on  assignment  to  a  designated high  cost area, pay grade,  years  of  service (longevity), and  status in regards to basic allowance for quarters (BAQ). The  entitlement  will  be  paid  at  either  the  with  or  without  dependent  rate.  Members  residing  in  the  barracks  will  receive  CONUS  COLA  at  the  without  dependent  rate irrespective  of  any  entitlement  to  basic  allowance  for  subsistence  (BAS).    The  following members are eligible to receive CONUS COLA: 28.8.1.  A member with or without dependents assigned to a high cost area in CONUS. 28.8.2.  A  member  in  an  unaccompanied  status  outside  CONUS,  if  the  primary  dependent resides in a designated CONUS high cost area. 28.8.3.  A member assigned to duty in CONUS and; 28.8.3.1.  The  primary  dependent  of  the  member  must  reside  in  a  high  cost  area  in CONUS by reason of the member’s duty location or other circumstances; and 28.8.3.2.  It  would  be  inequitable  for  the  member’s  eligibility  for  the  allowance  to  be determined on the basis of the duty location of the member (see JFTR para U8055-B). 28.9.  Definitions. 28.9.1.  High Cost Area.  Designated by the Secretary of Defense (listed in table 160). 28.9.2.  Member  With  Dependents.    A  member  who  is  entitled  to  BAQ  at  the  with dependent rate or would be entitled if Government quarters were not occupied. 28.9.3.  Member  Without  Dependents.    A  member  entitled  to  single  rate  BAQ  or  would  be entitled if Government quarters were not occupied.  This also includes partial rate BAQ. 28.9.4.  Primary  Dependent.    The  member ’s  spouse  or,  for  an  unmarried  member,  a dependent as defined per the JFTR Appendix A. 28.10.  Member  Married  to  Member.  Each is entitled to a CONUS COLA in his or her own right.  Entitlement exists  whether a joint residence or separate residences are maintained.  In no case  will  a  spouse  who  is  also  a  member  on  active  duty  be  considered  as  a  dependent  for entitlement  purposes.    When  a  member married to  member  couple  maintains a  joint  residence and they have dependents, CONUS COLA will be paid for one at the with dependent rate and for the other at the without dependent rate. 28.11.  Status. 28.11.1.  PCS.  Entitlement exists effective the day the member reports to the new permanent duty  station  (PDS)  in  a  high  cost  area.    The  PCS  arrival  transaction  (SG)  will  cancel AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 499  CONUS  COLA  start  (FID  5101)  transactions,  unless  the  entitlement  start  date  in  the  51  transaction  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  PCS  arrival  date  less  travel  days.    Upon departure, CONUS COLA continues to pay for the entire period of PCS, less the authorized travel days. 28.11.2.  Non-pay  status.    Not  payable  for  periods  of  a  non-pay  status  (i.e.,  excess  leave, AWOL). 28.11.3.  Separation.  Payable through the day of separation including days of terminal leave. 28.11.4.  Hospitalized.  See JFTR para U8006. 28.12.  Dual Payment of Overseas COLA and CONUS COLA.  A  member  assigned  outside CONUS  may  be  paid  overseas  COLA  at  the  applicable  without  dependent  rate  and  a  CONUS COLA  at  the  with  dependent  rate  or  the  high  cost  area  where  the  primary  dependent  resides.  Only  payable  if  there  are  no  command sponsored dependents residing with the member.  At no time will overseas COLA and CONUS COLA be paid concurrently at the with dependent rate. 28.13.  Members  Paying  Child  Support.  Members  receiving  with  dependent  rate  BAQ solely  for  the purpose of child support, are entitled to CONUS COLA at the without dependent rate. 28.14.  New  Accessions.  Newly  inducted  enlisted  or  reenlisted  members,  officers,  or  officer candidates are entitled as follows: 28.14.1.  Member without dependents - for the duty location to which assigned.  The rate will change  on  the  day  the  member  arrives  at  each  new  duty  location  until  arrival  at  the designated initial PDS. 28.14.2.  Members with dependents - for the location of the primary dependent until the day before  the  day  member  arrives  at  the  initial  PDS.

Temporary Lodging Allowance (TLA) is authorized to partially reimburse a member for  the  more  than  normal  expenses incurred  during occupancy  of temporary lodgings and  expenses  of  meals  obtained  as  a  direct  result  of  use  of  temporary  lodgings  outside  the CONUS  which  do  not  have  facilities  for  preparing  and  consuming  meals.      Conditions  of entitlement  to TLA are contained  in the JFTR, Volume I, chapter 9, part c. 29.2.  Substantiating Documents: 29.2.1.  AF Form 1357, Request for Temporary Lodging Allowance: 29.2.1.1.  An  AF  Form 1357 (Figure 29.2) is used  to  start,  stop,  or  change TLA  credit when a member: 29.2.1.1.1.  becomes entitled to IHA; 29.2.1.1.2.  is furnished government quarters for self, dependents, or both; 29.2.1.1.3.  becomes entitled to OHA and COLA. 29.2.1.2.  In every instance, the TLA type must be identified on the AF Form 1357. 29.2.1.2.1.  I  -  Incoming.  Authorized  for  beginning  of  member's  assignment  at permanent station. 29.2.1.2.2.  X - Incoming Extension. 29.2.1.2.3.  D  -  Departure.  Authorized  for  or  within  the  last  10  days  before  day  of departure of member from old permanent station or, in special cases, for early return of dependents.  See JFTR, paragraph U9024. 29.2.1.2.4.  E - Extension of Departure. 29.2.1.2.5.  K  -  Kitchen  Renovation.  When  residence  is  under  renovation  (kitchen) not requiring occupants to obtain temporary lodging. 29.2.1.2.6.  R  -  Full  Renovation.  When  renovation  or  special  circumstances  require occupants to occupy temporary lodging. 29.2.1.3.  For  household  goods  (HHG),  obtain  from  the  transportation  officer  and include  on  the  AF  Form 1357 the  date  when  HHG  were available  for  delivery and the date  HHG  were  delivered  and  accepted  by  member.  When  the  additional  period  of entitlement  is  due  to  non-arrival  of  HHG,  the  transportation  officer  must  certify  the  AF Form 1357. 29.2.1.4.  When  a  member  with  dependents  completes  AF  Form  1357,  a  predetermined election  must  be  made  to  continue  or  postpone  entitlement  to  TLA  for  any  period  of hospitalization or absence away from the permanent station while on assigned duty. 29.2.1.5.  AF  Form  1357  is  annotated  with  additional  information  to  substantiate payment. 514 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 29.2.1.6.  When  members  and/or  dependents  are  serviced  by  an  Army  housing  office, Army AE Form 3652 is authorized in lieu of AF Form 1357. 29.2.2.  Attachments to AF Form 1357: 29.2.2.1.  Attach to the original AF Form 1357: 29.2.2.1.1.  Special  orders.    Orders  are  required  for  the  original  payment.    Later payments require cross-reference to original payment. (copy  will  suffice) 29.2.2.1.2.  Receipts lodging  expense  claimed  (for example, hotel, motel, VOQ, BOQ, guest house, TLQ).  Unpaid bills may be used when  anticipating  expenses  to  pay  member  before  departure  if  actual  expenses  are verified  and  any  erroneous  payment  is  collected.  If  the  receipt  is  lost,  the  member certifies  a  statement  of  lodging  expense  containing  dates,  places,  establishment names, and amounts. for  any 29.2.2.1.3.  For itemization of meal expenses when government mess is utilized, use the format shown in JFTR, chapter 9, part c, or one substantially the same. 29.2.2.2.  Retention of copies is not required. 29.3.  Temporary  Lodging  Allowance-Departure  (TLA-D).  TLA  is  payable  before  the  day of  departure.  The losing FSO should make every attempt to make the final TLA payment prior to the member's departure and to adjust the account for erroneous information prior to payment. In  unusual  circumstances,  when  member  cannot  be  paid  before  departure,  losing  commander furnishes all information required for preparation of AF Form 1357 to the gaining commander to support payment of TLA-D, to be made at new permanent station.  Show complete geographical address such as city or station number, political subdivision, and country (for example, U-Tapao AB,  Chon  Buri  Province,  Thailand).    For  a  member  authorized  TLA-D  for  dependents  who remain at the old  station after  member's departure  PCS, include  date the  last dependent left the old  permanent  station.    Also,  include  the  reason  payment  could  not  be  made  by  losing commander.   Data  is  normally  prepared  by the  FSO.   It  can  be  prepared  by the  housing office or other officer as designated by the commander. 29.3.1.  Payment of TLA Departure for Dependents of Deceased Members.  TLA is authorized for dependents of  deceased  members prior to departing the overseas area.  Authorized  for  or within the last 10 days before day of departure from old permanent duty station.  TLA may not exceed 10 days unless authorized  per JFTR U9170.  Use  special orders  signed by competent authority  to  attach  to  the  original  AF  Form  1357.  Payment  may  be  authorized  in  10-day increments for the entire period that temporary lodgings must be used. 29.3.2.  Non-availability  of  Quarters.    A  non-availability  of  Government  quarters statement is required to support all TLA claims, except as provided in JFTR, Volume I, part C,  chapter  9.    Use  an  AF  Form  1357  and  PCS  orders  to  substantiate  all  payments.    When processing  TLA  payments  manually,  use  an  SF  Form  1034  (Figure  29.1)  and  report payments  as  in  Figure  29.4    Review  MMPA  of  member authorizing a  per  diem rate  other than that of the PDS concerned to prevent authorizing dual allowances. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 515  29.4.  TLA-Arrival.  TLA  paid  upon  initial  assignment  to  a  PDS  outside  CONUS  will  not normally  exceed  60  days.    An  additional  period  may  be  authorized.    The  60-day  entitlement period begins on the same date as authorized for OHA and COLA and the days do not have to be consecutive.  See JFTR paragraph U9202 for additional entitlement information. 29.5.  Additional  Factors  Affecting  TLA.  The  military  pay  SMA  must  ensure  that  member's entitlements are properly posted to the MMPA while in TLA status.  A suspense file may be used for  control  and  ensuring  proper  posting  of  entitlements  to  the  MMPA.    Members  on  TLA  are entitled  to BAS and  will  not  be  subject to  meal  charge deductions using the DN (see  AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 6.)  OHA and COLA are not to be paid for the same period member receives TLA except when concurrent payment of station allowances are allowed under JFTR, Volume I, paragraph U9100C4.  Except as otherwise authorized by paragraph U9100C4, do not start OHA and COLA until final payment of TLA-Incoming is made, and ensure that OHA and COLA are stopped or the stop dates are corrected to the day prior to the first day of TLA-Departure. 29.5.1.  There are no longer any deductions from TLA included in the computation. 29.5.1.1.  (DELETED) 29.5.1.2.  (DELETED) 29.5.1.3.  (DELETED) 29.5.1.4.  (DELETED) 29.5.2.  Daily Basis.  Ensure TLA is computed on a daily basis.  TLA computations will be made  in  increments  of  10  days  (15  days  when  determined  to  be  appropriate  by  the  TLA approving  authority)  or  less  when  entitlement  to  TLA  ceases  to  exist  before  the  end  of  a  10 day (or 15 day) period.  TLA computation is based on the Meals and Incidental Expense (M&IE) rate for each locality.  When cooking facilities are available, computation is based on one-half of the M&IE rate.  When cooking facilities are not available, then the  computation is based on the full M&IE rate.  (See paragraph 29.6 for TLA computation.) 29.5.2.1.  (DELETED) 29.5.2.2.  (DELETED) 29.5.2.3.  (DELETED) 29.5.2.4.  (DELETED) 29.5.3.  First and Last Day  of TLA.  TLA  for  the  first  day and the  last  day is  computed as though  meals are not available and the  full rate  of the M&IE rate is used.  This is  still  true when  cooking facilities are available.  The first day of TLA status is the first day for which payment  can  be  received;  this  may  not  be  the  day  of  arrival.    When  member  arrives  in  a MALT  plus  per diem  status,  no TLA  payment is authorized for that  day;  therefore, the  day after arrival is the first day of TLA status and meals are considered not available and the full M&IE rate is used to compute TLA for that day. 29.5.3.1.

(DELETED) 29.5.4.6.  (DELETED) 29.5.5.  Extra Room Charge.  The only reimbursable expense on a day prior to entering and after terminating a TLA status. 29.5.6.  Hospitalization.  When  TLA  is  authorized  during  hospitalization,  use  the  meals available rate  for TLA  computation.  See JFTR,  Volume I, paragraph  U9202E and  U9204H. This only applies  if all  persons  for  whom TLA  is received are  hospitalized  during all three meal periods or if all persons consumed three government meals.  (See paragraph 29.6.1.5)  When  member  or  dependents  are  not  hospitalized  during  all  three  meal  periods  (date  of admission  or  release)  or  all  persons  for  whom  TLA  is  received  do  not  consume  all  three government  meals,  use  the  meals  not  available  rate  if  cooking  facilities  are  not  available.  (See paragraph 29.6). 29.5.7.  Military-Married-to-Military  (each  with  dependents  in  own  right).    Determine  the total  percentage  for  lodging  purposes  per  JFTR,  Volume  I,  paragraph  U9207A1.    For example, member A has two  dependents and member B  has  one  number.   Per CG Decision B-217665,  23  August  1985,  one  member  is  entitled  to  receive  BAH  at  the  with-dependent rate  while  the  other  member  is  entitled  to  receive  BAH  at  the  without-dependent  rate.  In order  to  align  the  TLA  payments  to  this  CG  Decision,  the  member  receiving  BAH  at  the  with-dependent  rate  will  claim  all  the  dependents  for  TLA.  If  member  A  is  receiving  the  with-dependent  rate  BAH,  member  A  claims  self  and  3  dependents.   Member  B  will  claim TLA for self only.  Member A plus three dependents equals 150 percent.  If the lodging cost is $80 per day, divide $80 by 215 percent, which gives a result of $37,209.  Multiply the result by  150 percent (member and three dependents), resulting in a $55.81 lodging cost for member A.  For member B, multiply $37,209 by 65 percent, which results in a lodging cost of $24.19. 29.5.8.  Extensions.   When  an  extension  is  granted  beyond  the  normal  entitlement  period, attach  a  statement  authorizing  the  extension  to  AF  Form  1357  or  annotate  the  form  as prescribed in JFTR, Volume I, U9202F and AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 5, table 5-4. 29.5.9.

Computation Method: 29.6.1.1.  Step 1:  Determine the percentage to be used based on number of individuals. 29.6.1.1.1.  If  member  is  TDY  or  deployed,  still  include  them  in  the  number  of persons occupying the temporary lodgings. 29.6.1.2.  Step 2:  Determine the M&IE equivalency.  Multiply the percentage in Step 1 by  the  locality  M&IE  rate  (not  the  per  diem  rate).    If  meals  are  not  available,  use  the current  M&IE  rate.    If  meals  are  available,  use  one-half  (1/2)  of  the  M&IE  rate.    (If member is TDY, take the total and divide by the number of individuals on TLA to get the member’s  share  of  the  meal allowance.)   First and last day are always  computed at  the "Meals not Available" rate.  When staying with friends or relatives, cooking facilities are not  considered  available  since  they  are  not  for  the  exclusive  use  of  the  member  or member's dependents. 29.6.1.3.  Step  3:    Determine  Gross  Daily  Equivalency.    Add  the  results  in  Step  2  (less the member's share of the meal allowance if the member is TDY or deployed while away  from  their  new  permanent  station).  Add  the  actual  daily  lodging  cost.  If  staying with friends or relatives, lodging cost is not allowed. 29.6.1.4.  Step  4:  Determine  Net  Daily  Equivalency.  Deduct  the  total  daily  allowances. See paragraph 29-5 for deductible daily allowances. 29.6.1.5.  Step  5:    Determine  Maximum  TLA.    Multiply  the  percentage  obtained  in  Step 1 times the locality per diem rate (Lodging plus M&IE), if meals are not available. If  meals  are  available,  it  is  the  percentage  obtained  in  Step  1  times  the  adjusted  per diem rate (lodging plus 1/2 of the M&IE). 29.6.1.6.  Step  6:    Determine  Applicable  Daily  Rate.    Compare  the  amounts  found  in Step  4  and  Step  5  (less  the  members  meal  allowance  as  determined  in  Step  3  when member is TDY or deployed).  Pay the lesser of these two amounts for each day. 29.6.2.  Items for Reimbursement for Lodging costs: 29.6.2.1.  Receipts, invoices, or statements are required to verify lodging expenses. 29.6.2.2.  If a member is receiving OHA  for a lease  that  has not  expired prior to his/her applying for TLA-D, the member’s OHA continues until the lease expires or the member departs the area. 29.6.2.3.  When staying with friends or relatives, no lodging cost is allowed. 29.6.2.4.  Disregard meals under the Bed and Breakfast concept.  Consider this as lodging cost and add the appropriate meal rate. 29.6.3.  Per Diem Rates: 29.6.3.1.  Per JFTR, Volume I, paragraph U9207B, whenever government or commercial lodgings  are  not  available  at  the  PDS  and  member  must  obtain  government  or commercial  lodgings  at  a  nearby  location,  a  statement  from  the  housing  officer  is 518 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 required  to  support  computing  the  TLA  payment  based  upon  the  per  diem  rate  for  the location of the temporary lodging. 29.6.3.1.1.  If  the  housing  officer  does  not  provide  a  statement  authorizing  a  per diem  rate  other  than  that  of  the  PDS,  the  PDS  rate  will  be used  -  regardless  of  the location of the lodging. 29.6.3.1.2.  If  the  housing  officer  does  provide  a  statement  authorizing  a  per  diem rate  other than that  of the PDS, the authorized rate  will apply, regardless of  whether that rate is higher or lower than the rate of the PDS. 29.6.3.1.3.  If  member  does  not  use  recommended  lodging  and  the  housing  officer restricts  payment  to a  per  diem  rate lower  than  that of the  PDS,  the  housing  officer must annotate AF Form 1357 with the applicable per diem rate. 29.6.4.  Miscellaneous: 29.6.4.1.  TLA  is  payable  before  detachment  (departure)  from  the  old  PDS  and  after arrival  (reporting)  to  the  new  PDS.  For  dependents,  TLA  is  payable  before  departure from the area of the old PDS and after arrival in the area of the new PDS. 29.6.4.2.  TLA is not  payable  on day of arrival if member and/or dependents arrive in a MALT  plus  per  diem  status.  TLA is only  payable  if  MALT  plus per diem  is  otherwise not payable. 29.6.4.3.  Members  in  TLA-D  status  who  were  previously  assigned  a  dormitory room  and  received  partial  rate  BAH  are  entitled  to  full  rate  BAH  for  the  period  of  TLA-D. 29.7.  FSO  Actions.  Payment  of  Temporary  Lodging  Allowance  (TLA).    TLA  is  reflected  in  DJMS-AC as FID 79 for which members may elect to receive payment in their regular military pay  or  as  a  partial  payment  after  the  entitlement  has  been  processed.  For  members  electing immediate  payment  who  participate  in  the  direct  deposit  program,  process  a  CICS  trans  ID ‘JPBB’  (see paragraph 38.9.2  for a  more detailed scenario of this payment process) to  central site  to  disburse  the  amount  of  TLA  to  the  member’s  bank account.  After the  money has  been transmitted to the bank, a payment transaction (PK03) is systematically created to post against the member’s MMPA.  Members  who  have a  waiver  for  participation in the  direct  deposit  program may  continue  to  be  paid  locally.    JUMPS  Temporary  Lodging  Allowance  (JTLA)  is  a  stand-alone  application  that  computes  TLA  entitlements  in  accordance  with  JFTR,  Volume  I,  part  C, chapter 9, and Air Force Policy for structured or standard claims.  For non-structured or complex claims,  TLA  must  be  computed  manually,  paid  with  an  SF  Form  1034,  (Figure  29.1)  and processed  as  a  PS03  memo  entry  on  the  MMPA  (Figure  29.4).    Before  certifying  the authorization to TLA, review  the  member's  MMPA  to  ensure  the  allowances  not  authorized  to be  paid  concurrently  during  periods  of TLA are  stopped.    Normally,  stop  OHA and COLA  on the day before the member receives TLA (JFTR paragraph U9000). 29.7.1.  Preparation and Distribution of SF Form 1034: 29.7.1.1.  Preparation.

Complex Payments.  Send original to disbursing for payment and inclusion in  their  normal  document  submission,  file  second  copy  in  FSO-retained  file,  and provide  the third copy to the member. 29.7.2.  Interim  Payments.    Made  every  5  to  10  days  because  of  high  cost-of-living,  such payments  may  be  certified  by  the  commander  or  designee.    The  housing  or  transportation officer is required to furnish actual certification only on final settlement. 29.7.3.  Control.  Maintain a suspense control on every member authorized TLA, OHA, and COLA  for  dependents  who  remain  at  old  station  after  member  leaves  for  new  permanent station.  OHA and COLA are not normally  payable  during any period in  which  member is drawing TLA.   (See JFTR, Volume I, paragraph U9100-C4.)  Members on TLA are entitled to BAS.  (See AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 6.) 29.7.4.  Source of Input.  The housing officer furnishes data to the FSO.  The FSO furnishes input  to  DFAS-DE  by  input  of  a  7903  transaction  (or  PS03  memo  entry  for  off-line payments).  Figure 29.3 through Figure 29.4 are examples of the input transactions required for TLA. 29.7.5.  Advance  TLA.  Advance TLA is  payable  by  the  gaining  FSO  on  arrival and/or the losing  FSO  on  departure.    Substantiating  documents  are  DD  Form  2560  (Advance PayCertification/Authorization),  member’s  PCS  orders,  and  DFAS-DE  2424.    See  JFTR, chapter 9, paragraph 9190. 29.7.5.1.  The FSO computes the member’s TLA entitlement as if the member were filing for TLA reimbursement  versus an advance.   In  part  II, block 7,  enter “Advance TLA”, 520 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 and in block 8, enter the monetary advance TLA payment as a daily EFT payment, using FID PA03 with code “B” which is currently for OHA advance pay. 29.7.5.2.  The  limitation  for  number  of  days  TLA  advance  payable  is  set  by  the  FSO based on discussions with housing and determination of approximately how long before housing  will  be  available  for  the  member.    The  maximum  number  of  days  allowed  for advance TLA is 60 days per payment. 29.7.5.3.  Maintain a manual listing of Advance TLA payments and control them.  Once the PA-3 has processed, suspend the DV so it won’t collect.  The the member returns and files the actual TLA claim and it is input to JTLA, open the suspended DV so it collects by  offsetting  the  actual  TLA  entitlement.    If  members  refuse  to  file  their  actual  TLA claims and close out the advance, warn them and, after 30 days, open the DV and collect the advance from the member’s current pay. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 521  Figure 29.1.

Overseas  Housing  Allowance  (OHA)  is  authorized  to  assist  members  in defraying  the  excess  costs  incurred  incident  to  assignment  on  permanent  duty  to  a  station  outside CONUS.  Conditions of entitlement to OHA are contained in the JFTR, Volume I, chapter 9, part B. 30.2.  Substantiating Documents: 30.2.1.  The base billeting or housing office furnishes data to the FSO on the DD Form 2367, Individual Overseas Housing Allowance (OHA) Report.  A DD Form 2367 is required on all actions  except  PCS,  separation,  when  BAQ  is  being  changed,  or  changes  resulting  from  re-certification (see Figure 30.1). 30.2.2.  The  member  is  required  to  complete  AF  Form  1039,  Request  to  Receive  and/or Extend  Repayment  of  an  Advance  Housing  Allowance  to  Meet  Extraordinary  Expenses Incident  to  PCS  Move  (Figure  30.2),  when  requesting  an  advance  payment  for  housing.  The AF Form 1039 must also contain the approving official's signature. 30.3.  Definitions: 30.3.1.  Housing  Allowance  (HA).  Allowance  paid  to  partially  offset  the  high  cost  of housing in designated areas.  HA refers to: 30.3.1.1.  OHA 30.3.1.2.  Interim housing allowance 30.3.1.3.  OHA for unaccompanied member with dependents. 30.3.2.  Overseas  Housing  Allowance  (OHA).    The  allowance  paid  to  members  residing overseas or for member's dependents residing overseas. 30.3.3.  Interim  Housing  Allowance.  The  allowance  paid  for  a  maximum  of  60  days  to  a member  who  precedes  dependents  to  an  overseas  area  and  who  secures  non-government family quarters. 30.3.4.  Unaccompanied Housing Allowance to a Member With Dependents.  The allowance paid  at  the  single  rate  to  a  member  who  is  serving  an  unaccompanied  non-command-sponsored  tour.    The  member  does,  in  fact,  have  dependents  but  those  dependents  either remained in the CONUS or at another overseas area. 30.3.5.  Sharer: 30.3.5.1.  Sharers.    Members  entitled  to  OHA  who  reside  with  one  or  more  of  the following individuals: 30.3.5.1.1.  Military members (including spouse). 30.3.5.1.2.  Federal  civilian  employees,  including  dependents,  entitled  to  a  living quarters allowance (LQA). 528 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 30.3.5.1.3.  Individuals (excluding  dependents  of the  member)  who contribute to the rental or ownership expenses of the residence. 30.4.  Computation of OHA: 30.4.1.  OHA  is  based  on  the  difference  between  a  member's  BAH-II  and  FSH,  whichever applies,  and  the  total  of  the  rent  a  member  pays  overseas,  within  a  maximum  rent  ceiling established for a specific area, plus  the average utility, recurring maintenance allowance  for the specific area.  The ceilings for members with dependents are based on housing cost data obtained  from  members in  each area  concerned.  The ceiling for members with and without dependents are found in the JFTR, Appendix K. 30.4.1.1.  Rent  Paid.    This  element  shows  the  actual  rent  the  member  pays  for  housing costs.  The rent is as stated in the lease and is reported in the currency in which paid.  If the member  must pay a recurring condominium or homeowner association fee, it should be  prorated  to  a  monthly  charge  and  included  in  rent.    If  the  member  owns  his  or  her dwelling place, the amount to be considered as monthly "rent" is derived by dividing the actual  purchase  price  of  the  residence  by  120.    Also,  the  amount  of  any  personal installment  type  loans  (does  not  include  loans  used  to  furnish  or  decorate  a  home  or loans  for  personal  reasons,  or  credit  card  or  line  of  credit loans) and  real  estate equity loans  obtained  for  the  purpose  of  renovating,  repairing  or  enlarging  a  personal residence  will  be  added  to  the  actual  purchase  price  before  determining  the  derived rent.    If  the  dwelling  place  owned  by  the  member  is  a  mobile  home  or  vessel,  the monthly  lot  rental  or  berthing  fees  paid  will  be  added  to  this  amount.    When  the residence  is  owned  by  the  member  (member  doesn't  have  a  mortgage  payment)  the derived rent should be reported in US dollars. 30.4.1.2.  Maximum  Rent  Allowable  (MRA).  This  amount,  established  by  grade,  is determined by the PDTATAC.  This cap ensures the member is not reimbursed for more than  a  reasonable  amount  of  rent.  The  rent  caps  are  shown  in  the  JFTR,  Volume  I, appendix  K,  and  on  DJMS  table  65.  Rent  paid  is  converted  to  a  United  States  dollar equivalent and compared to the maximum rent allowable.  The OHA allowance is based on the lesser of the two. 30.4.1.3.  Utility/Recurring Maintenance Allowance.  The Utility/Recurring Maintenance Allowance is based on average expenses reported  by members with  dependents,  where possible,  and  found  in  appendix  K  to  the  JFTR.    Utility  indicators  are  included  in  the input transactions to determine what, if any, utilities are provided by the landlord.  These indicators are  based  on the  climate of  the  geographical  area.   When  processing  start  or change  OHA  transactions,  ensure  allowance  correctly  reflects  the  information  on  the  DD 2367.   For purposes of the  Utility/Recurring  Maintenance  Allowance, members are classified into one of the following categories: 30.4.1.3.1.  Member  married  to  member  and  maintaining  a  joint  household;  each member may be entitled to half of the utility/recurring maintenance allowance. 30.4.1.3.2.  Member defined as sharer in paragraph 30-3; member may be entitled to a pro-rata share of the utility/recurring maintenance allowance. 30.4.1.3.3.  Member  with  dependents;  member  may  be  entitled  to  the  entire utility/recurring maintenance allowance. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 529  30.4.1.3.4.  Member without dependents who is not defined as a sharer; member may be entitled to 75 percent of  the utility/recurring allowance (unless a specific rate has been established for such members in the JFTR). 30.4.1.4.  Move-In Housing Allowance (MIHA).  Members entitled to OHA are eligible to receive  MIHA.  The  purpose  of  MIHA  is  to  defray  costs  incurred  on  or  after  1  Sep  90 which  are  associated  with  occupying  privately  leased/owned  quarters  covered  by  the OHA program.  MIHA is broken down into 3 categories: 30.4.1.4.1.  MIHA  Miscellaneous  - Reflects average  expenditures  made  by members to make dwellings habitable.  (See JFTR, Appendix N for further information.) 30.4.1.4.2.  MIHA Rent - Payable only when approved by the Housing Office and is not payable to homeowners.  (See JFTR, Appendix N for further information.) 30.4.1.4.3.  MIHA Security - Payable only in specified areas.  (See JFTR, Appendix N for further information.) 30.4.1.5.  Total  Calculation.    These  elements  are  all  used  in  the  calculation  of  OHA.  Stated in order: 30.4.1.5.1.  Rent is converted to US dollars based on the applicable exchange rate.  If the member is a sharer, the member's rent is a pro rata share of total rent. 30.4.1.5.2.  If  rent  includes  all  utilities,  add  the  utility/recurring  maintenance allowance  to  the  maximum  rental  allowance  ceiling.    If  rent  includes  none  of  the utilities  or  some  but  not all utilities, add  the amount of the average utility/recurring maintenance allowance determined IAW JFTR, Appendix K. 30.4.1.5.3.  Rent  is  compared  to  the  maximum  rent  allowable,  determined  in (b) above, for the specific JFTR location and grade.  The lesser of the two is used. 30.4.1.5.4.  Add  the  rent  determined  in  (c)  above,  the  utility/recurring  maintenance allowance calculated in 30.4.1.5.2 above, and the MIHA. 30.4.1.5.5.  Subtract  the  member's  BAH  or  FSH-O  or  FSH-B  from  total  costs determined in 30.4.1.5.4 above.  The result is the member's OHA.  OHA is paid based on a 30-day month. 30.4.1.6.  Using  BAH  Versus  FSH.  The  applicable  rate  of  BAH  is  subtracted  when  the member  is  receiving  single  BAH  or  with-dependent  BAH  when  accompanied  by dependents.  When the member precedes dependents (interim housing allowance) or has dependents but elects the unaccompanied tour, subtract the rate of FSH. 30.4.2.  Rules  for  Determining  Appropriate  Utility/Recurring  Maintenance  Allowance. Utility/Recurring  Maintenance  values,  as  well  as  utility  values  and  climate  codes  are contained in the JFTR, Volume I, appendix K, and in DJMS tables 65 and 68. 30.4.2.1.  When the  member is a homeowner and pays all utilities, the  proper allowance will be added to the appropriate rental allowance ceiling when computing OHA. 30.4.2.2.  When maintenance allowance will be paid. the  member's rent includes  all  utilities,  no  utility/recurring 530 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 30.4.2.3.  When the member's rent includes some utilities, the member's utility point score is determined  by adding the point  values  for the utilities  not  checked in  block 7c  of the DD Form 2367, based on the climate code for the PDS. 30.5.  Advance Payment of OHA, BAH, and Security Deposit: 30.5.1.  An advance  payment  of  overseas  housing allowance  is  payable upon request  of the member  when  authorized  by  the  Base  Housing  Officer  and  approved  by  member's Commander.    The  member  is  required  to  complete  AF  Form  1039  (Figure  30.2)  when requesting an advance payment for housing and/or extending the repayment.   The AF Form 1039  must  also  contain  the  approving  official's  signature.   Liquidation  of  the  advance  will usually be at a rate of not less than equal monthly installments of 1/12 the amount advanced per month for the next 12 months.  Repayment, however, must not be less than $50 per month. 30.5.2.  Collection  action  will  begin  on  the  first  day  of  the  month  after  payment  of  the advance  has  been  made.    When  justified  by  the  member,  postponement  or  extension  of repayment  may  be  authorized  by  the  member's  commander.    An  advance  housing allowance  may  be  authorized  for  the  purchase  of  personal  property  needed  to  occupy economy housing,  but is limited to  those  items  necessary  for  occupancy  and  reasonable  in nature.    The  guide  to  be  used  to  determine  the  amount  of  advance  housing  allowance  a member  may  receive  for is  AFI  32-6004  (Attachment  8), plus  major  appliances.  Attachment  8  lists the items that  the  government would furnish if the items were available or if government quarters were assigned. the  purchase  of  personal  property 30.5.3.  Normally  an  advance  housing  allowance  must  not  be  paid  more  than  3  workdays before the member is required to make payment under a lease or purchase plan, and except in  extraordinary  circumstances,  payment  must  be  made  within  30  days  after  occupancy.  This 30-day period allows a member sufficient time to move in and determine any extra costs associated with the new quarters that  were not readily apparent before or immediately upon occupancy.  When extraordinary circumstances warrant, a waiver of the 30-day period may be approved by the Base Housing Officer.  The member is required to submit a written request to the housing officer.  This request is to briefly state the reason for the delayed advance and show that  the  funds are needed to  meet advance rent,  security  deposits,  or  initial  expenses. The  housing  officer  is  required  to  approve  or  disapprove  the  payment.  This  approval  is attached to the payment voucher.  The amount of the advance should not exceed the total of 1 year's  allowance  expected  to  be  accrued  by  the  member.    A  larger  amount  may  be authorized,  if  needed,  to  cover  anticipated  housing  expenses.  In  no  case  will  the  advance payment  exceed  the  member's  anticipated  housing  expenses  or  the  OHA  and  BAQ accruable during  the  member's  tour at  that  station, whichever is  less.   An advance under a purchase  plan  will  also  not  exceed  the  normal  rental  deposit  required  for  suitable  housing for a member of the applicant's grade and dependency status.   If the rental deposit required for  suitable  housing  is  not  available,  1/120th  of  the  purchase  price  (per  JFTR,  Volume  I, appendix  K,  paragraph 2)  may be used as the  equivalent  of 1  month's rent plus  charges  for installation  fees,  if  charged  separately.   When  an  advance  under  the  purchase  plan  is  given the  member,  the  amount  must  be  based  on  utility  deposits  and  initial  expenses  and  the advance must not be used in the purchase (closing costs, upgrades, etc.). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 531  30.5.4.  The advance  may  be  paid to an  eligible  member  to  meet  extraordinary  expenses  of obtaining or  occupying  other than government housing  in  the  vicinity  of the  member's duty station.    Extraordinary  "moving  in"  expenses  should  be  reflected  in  the  applicable  blocks 4a, 4b, and 4c of AF Form 1039.  Block "4d other" is not valid for Air Force use and should not be used.  Extraordinary expenses include such items as: 30.5.4.1.  Security deposits. 30.5.4.2.  Installation fees. 30.5.4.3.  Advance rent or lease. 30.5.5.  As  a  minimum  requirement,  a  copy  of  the  rental  or  purchase  agreement  should support  the  member's  request  for  advance.    The  approving  authority  is  required  to  retain copies  of  all  supporting  purchase  contracts  and  rental  agreements  for  the  length  of  the member's tour.  The approving authority  may require a  financial  statement  or  other proof  of need when considered necessary. 30.5.6.  In  service-couple  cases  or  rent-sharing  plans,  the  combined assets,  allowances,  and expenses of the occupants are considered in making determinations. 30.5.7.  The  approving  authority  submits  the  approved  AF  Form  1039  to  the  FSO  for payment.  Supporting documentation for the advance should be filed in the approving office. Normally  the  advance  should  not  be  paid  more  than  3  workdays  before  the  member  is required  to  make  payment  under  a lease  or purchase plan.  For personnel at a duty location not  having  a  local  payment  office,  the  advance  may  be  paid  earlier  as  required  by  mail  or transportation schedules.  If the lease or purchase plan is not completed, the advance must be repaid in full immediately. 30.5.8.  An advance payment of an OHA for a purchase plan may be made only once during a  member's  tour  unless  the  home  is  damaged  or  destroyed  beyond  habitation  and  the  home was not covered by compensable insurance.  (Request for exceptions to this provision may be forwarded  with to  HQ USAF/DPPC.) through  approval  channels justification  and recommendations 30.5.9.  Additional  advances  covering  rental  plans  may  be  approved  at  any  time  for  valid reasons  as  determined  by  the  approving  authority.  Valid  reasons  include  housing  removed from  rental  market  or  member  required  larger,  less  expensive,  or  closer  accommodations. Outstanding advances remaining upon authorization of an additional advance will be added to the additional amount and a new repayment schedule established. 30.5.10.  Refer to  Attachment  4  for the proper advance pay  category to use in the advance transaction and JPBB.  If payment is made locally, process a PA03 to report the payment.  If payment is made via EFT, use JPBB (see subparagraph 38.9.2 for detailed information on this  application)  to  request  the  advance  payment.    If  the  advance  requested  includes  a security  deposit  over  $500,  make  two  separate  payments  (as  specified  above);one  for  the OHA/BAH (type B) portion, the other for the security deposit (type S) part.  Both can be paid on  the  same  voucher  number,  but  must  be  input  separately.    Collection  of  the  advance security deposit, if greater than $500, can be suspended until the member vacates the housing for  which the advance  was requested, using  the PA03 transaction or JPBB.   This  will help preclude  financial  hardship  that  may  be  caused  by  the  member  having  to  liquidate  a  large 532 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 advance payment which will, in all likelihood, be refunded when he or she moves out.  Lump sum  recoupment  will  not  exceed  the  amount  of  money  returned  to  the  member  by  the landlord.  Any balance of an advance not returned by the landlord may be liquidated over the months  until  the  member  departs  PCS  or  12  months,  whichever  is  less,  if  desired  by  the member. See Figure 30.16 for the advance pay (PA) format, Attachment 4 for advance pay category codes, and  subparagraph 30.5.11 below  for collection.    NOTE:  When justified by the member and approved by the member's commander, this suspension may be for up to  96 months, but in  no  case  will the  collection remain  suspended  for longer  than  the  member occupies the housing. 30.5.10.1.  Disburse  advance  security  deposits  in  local  currency  where  possible.  Annotate the current exchange rate, whether disbursed in local currency or dollars, on the voucher  and  maintain  a  manual  suspense  file  until  the  member  vacates  the  housing  for which  it  was  paid.    When  housing  is  terminated  and  the  member  brings  in  the  amount received from the landlord: 30.5.10.1.1.  Clear  the  DV  if  the  amount  returned  to  the  member  and  brought  to finance is equal to the amount disbursed (i.e., no currency fluctuation). 30.5.10.1.2.  If the entire amount of the deposit paid to the landlord is returned to the member, as  evidenced  by the  currency  conversion receipt the  member provides, any dollar  difference  between  the  amount  received  from  the  landlord  at  the  current exchange  rate  and  the  amount  originally  disbursed  to  the  member  at  the  previous exchange  rate  is  charged  or  credited  to  a  project  in  the  military  personnel appropriation.  See paragraphs 30.5.10.1.2.1 through 30.5.10.1.3.5 below for specific procedures. 30.5.10.1.2.1.  If  the  total  amount  collected  now  includes  a  gain    due  to  a favorable currency fluctuation indicated on the receipt for the currency exchange the member provides, the gain is credited to 57*3500 project 515.04 for officers, 535.04 for enlisted members. 30.5.10.1.2.2.  If  the  total  amount  collected  now  includes  a  loss  due  to  an unfavorable  currency  fluctuation  indicated  on  the  receipt  for  the  currency exchange the member provides, the loss is charged to 57*3500 project 515.04 for officers,  535.04  for  enlisted  members.    The  FSO  does  a  collection  voucher showing a cash collection in the amount the member brings to finance.  The entire amount of the suspended debt is shown on the voucher as 510 or 530, but because there was a loss, the voucher also shows a charge (debit) to the Foreign Currency Fluctuation Account (FCFA) citing either 515.04 or 535.04 for the difference due to currency fluctuation.   This is because the cashier will actually be taking in less than  the  total  amount  of  the  advance  as  reflected  on  the  MMPA.    Since  all vouchers citing 510/530 require DJMS input, a C903 and  C203 are processed for the amount of the total in the DV for the security deposit advance against the debt on the record.   If done properly, this will close the debt. 30.5.10.1.3.  If  the  member  damages  the  property  (breaks  a  door,  etc.)  and  receives less  than  the  full  amount  from  the  landlord  because  of  the  damage,  compute  the amount that  must  be  set up  as  a  debt  to  be  collected  through  installment  payments.  The  computation  is  based  on  the  total  dollar  amount  returned,  taking  into AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 533  consideration  the  difference  between  the  exchange  rate  on  the  date  the  member received the advance and the current rate, and after deducting any gain or loss due to currency fluctuation, determining the  balance remaining outstanding.  The following example illustrates this computation: 30.5.10.1.3.1.  Member gets a 1,000 pound advance security deposit on 7/1/08, at an exchange rate of $2 to L1.  Debt established, and suspended, in the amount of $2,000. .  At that exchange rate, time, the original $2,000 is equivalent to $1,970, so the loss due to currency fluctuation is $30.00. 30.5.10.1.3.2.  On 7/1/10, the exchange rate the member gets when converting the amount he received from the landlord is $1.97 to L1.  At that exchange rate, the original  $2,000  would  be  equivalent  to  $1,970  and  the  loss  due  to  currency fluctuation would be $30.00. 30.5.10.1.3.2.1.  On 7/1/10, member received 500 pounds from landlord upon vacating the rental.  Member damaged a window and a door.  30.5.10.1.3.2.2..  Member repays 500 pounds to the finance office.  That 500 pounds is now valued at $985 dollars.  The $15.00 difference  between the original  currency exchange  rate  and  the  current  exchange  rate  is  charged  as  indicated  in 30.5.10.1.2.2 above. 30.5.10.1.3.3.  Member  repays  5,500  pounds to  the  finance  office.  Difference  in exchange  rate  from  7/1/95  to  7/1/97  is  $165.00  loss,  which  is  cha rged  to  the applicable project. 30.5.10.1.3.4.  Member  owes  the  remaining  balance  in  the  DV,  $1,000,    (500 pound difference times original $2 to L1) less the $15.00 currency fluctuation loss ($1,000 minus $985) is charged as indicated in 30.5.10.1.2.2. above. 30.5.10.1.3.5.  Member  has  a  $985  debt  that  may  be  liquidated  in  monthly installments. 30.5.10.2.  If the open DV has an action indicator of Q8, the DT04 will not process.  Wait until the update after  the  first  of the  month, and the action indicator  will  change to 01, then process the DT04. 30.5.10.3.  Once the DT04 has processed changing the deduction to zero, a management file must be created to track the suspense to open the collection at the appropriate time. 30.5.11.  The  initial  installment  for the advance OHA  (type B)  may be delayed up to  three months  with  the  member's  commander's  approval.    Use  a  PA03  transaction  to  delay  the start  of  collection. Normally, repayment  of the advance OHA/BAQ (type  B) is at a rate  of 1/12  per  month  for  12  months,  but  may  be  extended,  when  justified  by  the  member  and approved by the member's commander, for up to 60 months, not to exceed the length of the member's tour. 30.5.12.  Distribution  of  AF  Form  1039.    The  FSO  uses  AF  Form  265,  FSO  Payment Authorization  (JUMPS),  to  authorize  payment  for   The  EFT  pay request/authorization  form  will  be  used  to  authorize  payments  for  central  payees.  The  AF Form  1039  is  attached  to  the  original  AF  Form  265  or  a  copy  of  EFT  payment request/authorization  form  depending  on  which  one  was  used.    For  requests  to  extend local  payees. 534 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 repayment  periods,  made  subsequent  to  the  advance,  the  AF  Form  1039  is  attached  to  the DTL for  submission to DFAS-DE as  support  for the request.  Copies  of  the  AF Form 1039 are distributed as follows: 30.5.12.1.  Original -- attached to payment voucher/EFT form or DTL (as applicable). 30.5.12.2.  Second copy -- member. 30.5.12.3.  Third copy -- approving official. 30.5.12.4.  Fourth copy -- FSO hold copy. 30.6.  Special Provisions: 30.6.1.  Payment  of  OHA  While  on  Terminal  Leave.    When  a  member  receiving  OHA returns  to  CONUS  for  terminal  leave  and  subsequent  separation,  the  losing  FSO  must process a stop transaction to stop the housing allowance.  If the member returns to overseas area, process a report transaction to adjust housing allowance. 30.6.2.  Member Reassigned and Dependents Remain in Overseas Area: 30.6.2.1.  When  a  member  is  assigned  to  a  restricted  overseas  area  and  the  dependents remain  at  the  old  station,  the  FSO  of  the  member's  new  duty  station  must  restart  the overseas housing entitlement as well as start the restricted area housing if applicable. 30.6.2.2.  When a  member is assigned to CONUS and the dependents remain at the  old station  where  overseas  housing  is  authorized  for  dependents,  the  CONUS  FSO  restarts the OHA as well as dual housing if applicable. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 535  30.6.3.  Housing  Allowance  While  in  a  PCS  Status:   Housing  allowances  being  paid  under the OHA system stops 1 day before the date departed last duty station (DDLDS) as shown in the PCS departure (SH03) transaction.  If the DDLDS in the PCS arrival (SG03) transaction is different from that in the SH03, the housing allowance is corrected accordingly. 30.7.

FORMAT-IDs 43 and 55: 30.8.1.1.1.  STARTS.  All  housing  starts  must  be  compatible  with  BAQ.  To  keep consistency,  BAQ  is  checked  from  the  effective  date  of  the  housing  start  through the end of the current month.  Items checked are the government quarters assignment code  and  the  number  of  dependents  for  BAQ.  The  configuration  of  the  BAQ  entry determines if the housing transaction will process, recycle, or reject.  The first check is against  the  quarters  assignment  code.  If  that  code  is  a  1,  meaning  assigned government quarters, the transaction is recycled waiting for BAQ to be updated.  The recycle  period  is  15  days  processing  at  3-day  intervals.    Each  time  the  transaction attempts  to  process  and  finds  that  BAQ  has  not  been  updated,  the  transaction  will recycle  awaiting  update  of  BAQ.    If,  on  the  15th  day,  BAQ  has  not  been updated,  the  start  transaction  rejects  to  the  servicing  FSO  with  error  codes  MCQ, EJD.    Thus,  to  pass  the  first  edit,  the  MMPA  BAQ  entry  must  contain  a  "QTR-ASSGN"  code  of  a  "2"  and  must  be  compatible  with the  NR  DEPN-BAQ/HOUS-ACCOM-STAT  reflected  on  the  43/55,  housing  transaction  or, the transaction is immediately rejected with error code EJD.  If the BAQ entry shows no  assigned  quarters  from  the  effective  date  forward,  the  second  edit  is  performed against  the  number  of  BAQ  dependents.    If  the  housing  accompanied  status  equals zero, the NR-DEPNS = BAQ must be zero; but if the number of BAQ dependents is 1 throughout  the  period  of  entitlement,  the  housing  transaction  will  recycle  as mentioned above.  If the number of BAQ dependents was changed after the housing transaction  effective  date,  the  transaction  rejects.  If  the  BAQ  closest  dependency code  equals  X, the accompanied OHA entry  will  process; or if the assignment  code 536 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 is  ‘1’  and  the  adequacy  code  is  ‘4’,  the  OHA  transaction  will  process.  Specific conditions and examples: for the entire  period  of  entitlement. 30.8.1.1.1.1.  HOUSING  ACCOMPANIED  STATUS  =  0.    This  transaction  is used  exclusively  for  single  member  receiving  single  BAQ.    If  the  ACCOM STAT=0,  BAQ  QUARTERS-ASSIGNMENT-  Code  must  be  a  code  2  (not  assigned  qtrs) If  a  QUARTERS-ASSIGNMENT-CODE = 1  for  the  entire period of  entitlement, the transaction  is  recycled  with  error  code  REE  (T-RECYCLED-GOVERNMENT ASSIGNMENT  AND  OR  NUMBER  DEPENDENTS  BAQ  are  incompatible with the  QUARTERS-ASSIGNMENT-CODE = 1  for  a  portion  of  the  period  and  =  2  for another EJD  (GOVERNMENT-QUARTERS NUMBER DEPENDENTS BAQ/HOUSING  ACCOMPANIED  STATUS are incompatible). Exception  to  this  process  will  occur  when  the  assignment  code  is  ‘1’  and  the adequacy code is ‘4’, the OHA transaction will process, even though the member is assigned to a dorm.  The following examples apply: will ASSIGNMENT be AND/OR update  BAQ). accommodation transaction rejected portion, the  housing status,  If 5501 Effective = 910701 T-EFF-DATE = 910701 END OF CURR-MO = 910730 810701 ACCOM-STAT = 0 QTRS-ASSGN = 1 810730 ACCOM-STAT= 0 QTRS-ASSGN = 2 PROCESSED TRANSACTION RECYCLED TRANSACTION   810730 810701 ACCOM-STAT = 0 QTRS-ASSGN = 1  QTRS-ASSGN=2 REJECTED TRANSACTION   30.8.1.1.1.1.1.  A  compatibility  in  number  of  dependents  is  required.    This field must be 0 for the entire period of time.  If it is not 0 for the entire period, the  transaction  will  be  recycled  with  error  code  REE.    If  the  number  of dependents changed during the period  of  entitlement, the transaction  will  be rejected EJD.   The following examples apply: 810730 810701 ACCOM-STAT = 0  QTRS-ASSGN = 2  NR-DEPNS = 0  PROCESSED TRANSACTION           RECYCLED TRANSACTION                 REJECTED TRANSACTION 810701 ACCOM-STAT = 0   QTRS-ASSGN = 2  NR-DEPNS = 1  810701 ACCOM-STAT = 0  QTRS-ASSGN=2  NR-DEPNS = 0 810730 810730 NR DPENS = 1     AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 537   30.8.1.1.1.2.  HOUSING  ACCOMPANIED  STATUS  =  1.    DEPENDENTS  IN AREA. The same theory that applies to the accompanied status of 0 is applied to the  accompanied  status  of  1.    This  status  represents  a  married  member  whose dependents  are  in  the  area.  The  edit against the quarters assignment  code is  not changed;  that  is,  it  must  equal  2  for  the  full  period  of  entitlement.    But  in  this situation  the  number  of  dependents  for  BAQ  must  =  1  for  the  entire  period  of entitlement.  This shows BAQ with dependents.  The following examples apply: 810730 810701 ACCOM-STAT = 1  QTRS-ASSGN = 2  NR-DEPNS = 1  810730 810701 ACCOM-STAT = 1  QTRS-ASSGN = 2  NR-DEPNS = 0  810701 ACCOM-STAT = 1   QTRS-ASSGN=2  NR-DEPNS = 0 810730 NR DPENS = 1 PROCESSED TRANSACTION             RECYCLED TRANSACTION           REJECTED TRANSACTION   30.8.1.1.1.3.  HOUSING  ACCOMPANIED  STATUS  =  1.    DEPENDENTS RESIDING  ELSEWHERE.   This  process  will  occur  when  member  has dependents  residing  elsewhere  and  has  been  assigned  to  unaccompanied personnel housing.   When the quarters-assignment code is ‘1’, quarters-adequacy code  is  ‘4’,  and  the  number  of  dependents  is  ‘1’,  start  transactions  for  housing allowances  (i.e.,  FIDS  44,  45,  55,  or  57)  will  process.    If  BAQ  quarters adequacy  code  is  changed  from  ‘4’  to  any  other  code  and  quarters  assignment remains 1, then all housing allowances (FIDS 43, 44, 45, 55, 57 or 55) will stop.  If  BAQ  is  changed  to  a  without-dependent  rate,  housing  allowances  OHA  (FID 44) or dual OHA (FID 45 or 57) will stop effective the day before the change or  correction.  If  BAQ  quarters  assignment  code  of  2  is  changed  to  1  and  the BAQ adequacy code remains ‘4’, the OHA (FID 43 or FID 55) will not change, but it will stop interim OHA (FID 44) or dual OHA (FID 45 or 57) effective the day  before  the  change  or  correction  date,  and  an  X104  management notice  will be issued. 30.8.1.1.2.  STOPS AND CANCELS.  On receipt of a stop or cancel transaction, the entitlement is stopped or canceled at the rate established on the MMPA. 30.8.1.1.3.  REPORTS.  As  with  start  transactions,  report  transactions  must  be compatible  with  BAQ  entitlement.   Quarters  assignment  code  must  be  2  (not  assigned).    If  there  is  a  period  of  both  assigned  and  not  assigned  after  the effective date of housing, the transaction rejects with error code EJD, GOVT-QTRS-ASSIGN AND/OR NR-DEPN-Q--HOUS-ACCOMP-STATUS INCOMPATIBLE.   If the  quarters  assignment  code  is  2  (not  assigned  government  quarters),  the  second edit is against the number  of  dependents.  If the  housing accompanied  status is  zero, the number of BAQ dependents must be zero.  If it is not, the transaction will recycle pending  a  change  to  BAQ.    When  the  number  of  BAQ  dependents  is  changed  to zero, the transaction will process. 538 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 30.8.1.1.4.  CHANGES:  The 4304 and 5504 transaction may change: 30.8.1.1.4.1.  JTR Location. 30.8.1.1.4.2.  Rent Paid. 30.8.1.1.4.3.  Currency Code. 30.8.1.1.4.4.  Utility Indicator. 30.8.1.1.4.5.  Accompanied Status. As many items as necessary may be changed in one transaction.  Since there is a direct link between BAQ and housing, the change of accompanied status should be necessary only when going from 2 to 0 or 0 to 2. 30.8.1.1.5.  CORRECTS.    The  correct  transaction  is  used  to  correct  erroneous  data that was originally submitted.  Any item may be corrected. 30.8.1.2.  FORMAT-IDs 44 and 56: 30.8.1.2.1.  START.  Interim housing allowance  cannot be  started unless the  member is receiving  B AQ  with  dependent s  or  no  B AQ  a t  all.   B AQ  with  dependents is  defined  a s GOVT-QTRS-ASSIGNMENT-CODE = 2 and BAQ-NR-DEPNS = 1.  The same basic edits are made as in 30.8.1 above. 30.8.1.2.1.1.  If  the  member  is  receiving  partial  BAQ  for  the  entire  period  of entitlement, the transaction will be recycled with error code REE. 30.8.1.2.1.2.  If  the  member  is  receiving  without-dependent  BAQ  for  the  entire period of entitlement, the transaction will be recycled REE. 30.8.1.2.1.3.  If the member has no BAQ for the entire period, the transaction will be processed.  If the FORMAT ID (FID) is 44 or 56, FSA Type 1 will be used as an offset in the OHA calculation. 30.8.1.2.1.4.  If  the  member  has  BAQ  with  dependents  for  the  entire  period  the transaction  will be  processed.    If the  FID is 56,  FSA Type  1  will  be  used as an offset in the OHA calculation. 30.8.1.2.1.5.  If  the  member  has  any  combination  of  the  type  of  BAQ mentioned in 30.8.1.2.1.1 and 30.8.1.2.1.2 above, the transaction will be rejected with error code EJD. 30.8.1.2.2.  STOP/CANCEL.  Interim Housing Allowance (IHA) is stopped by a 4402 or  5602  and  canceled  by  a  4406  or  5606  transaction,  or  by  the  receipt  of  an  OHA start  (4301  or  5501)  transaction.    If  none  of  the  above  inputs  are  received,  IHA  is automatically stopped 60 calendar days from the effective date. 30.8.1.2.3.  REPORTS.  IHA  report  transactions  follow  the  same  BAQ  consistency guidelines. A report transaction cannot exceed 60 days. 30.8.1.2.4.  CHANGE.    A  change  transaction  will  change  all  items  except  the accompanied status code. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 539  30.8.1.2.5.  CORRECT.    A  correct  transaction  will  correct  the  original  entitlement that  has  erroneous  data  such  as  dates,  etc.    If  dates  are  corrected,  the  total  span  of entitlement cannot exceed 60 days. 30.8.1.3.  FORMAT-IDs 45 and 57: 30.8.1.3.1.  STARTS  AND  REPORTS.    Consistency  edits  between  BAQ  and housing allowance must be met to allow processing. 30.8.1.3.1.1.  If  the  member  is  receiving  partial  BAQ  for  the  entire  period  of entitlement, the transaction will be recycled with error-code REE. 30.8.1.3.1.2.  If  the  member  is  receiving  BAQ  without  dependents  for  the  entire period of entitlement, the transaction will be recycled with error code REE. 30.8.1.3.1.3.  If  member  has  no  BAQ  for  the  entire  period  of  entitlement,  the transaction  will  process.    If  the  FID  is  45  or  57,  FSA  will  be  edited  (see 30.8.1.3.1.6 and 30.8.1.3.1.7 below). 30.8.1.3.1.4.  If  member  has  BAQ  with  dependents  for  the  entire  period  of entitlement,  the  transaction  will  process.    If  the  FID  is  45  or  57,  FSA  will  be edited (see 30.8.1.3.1.6 and 30.8.1.3.1.7 below). 30.8.1.3.1.5.  If  the  member  has  any  combination  of  the  types  of  BAQ  (1 through 4) above, the transaction will be rejected EJD. 30.8.1.3.1.6.  If the  member  has FSA type 1  for the  entire period  of entitlement, the transaction will be processed. 30.8.1.3.1.7.  If  the  member  has  no  FSA  type  1,  the  LE  entry  will  be  checked for  duty country of 15 (Hawaii).   If 15, the transaction will be processed.  If not 15, the transaction  will  be  processed  and  UV03  management  notice  sent  to  the servicing  FSO.    The  literal  explanation  is:    "Housing  Processed.    Check entitlement to FSA type 1." 30.8.1.3.2.  RECYCLES.    All  recycles  mentioned  are  for  15  days  processing  in  3-day  intervals,  generating  the  UCO3  management  notice  (JTR-LOCATION  (T), JTR-LOCATION (M) INCOMPATIBLE). 30.8.2.  BAQ Interfaces With OHA.   Changes have  been  made to ensure BAQ and  housing remain  compatible.    The  OHA  interface  with  BAQ  has  been  changed  to  allow  parameter passing  between programs.   What  this  means  is,  housing  will be changed  at the  same time BAQ  is  changed.    If  for  any  reason  housing  cannot  be  updated,  the  BAQ  will  still  be changed  and  a  processed  transaction  for  review  will  be  provided  to  DFAS-DE/FJP.    The following actions cause interactions between BAQ and housing. 30.8.2.1.  FORMAT-IDs  43  and  55:    (See  Figure  30.4  through  Figure  30.5  and  Figure 30.10 through Figure 30.11) 30.8.2.1.1.  3502-BAQ stopped; OHA present and is stopped.  An X102 is sent when a  BAQ  stop  transaction  is  processed  and  a  43,  45,  55,  or  57  entry  is  present.    A computer  generated  OHA  stop  transaction  has  processed.    Adjust  member's  OHA entitlement if applicable. 540 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 30.8.2.1.2.  BAQ is changed to substandard quarters--Housing  is  stopped.   An X101 management notice is sent to the servicing FSO. 30.8.2.1.3.  BAQ is changed to partial--Housing is stopped. 30.8.2.1.4.  BAQ from  with-dependents to single--Housing is not changed.  An X103 management notice is sent to the servicing FSO. to  with-dependents  or changed single from is 30.8.2.1.5.  BAQ from  with-dependents to single--Housing is not changed.  An X103 management notice is sent to the servicing FSO. to  with-dependents  or is  corrected single from 30.8.2.1.6.  Start date of a BAQ entry is corrected--Housing start date is corrected. 30.8.2.1.7.  Stop date of a BAQ entry is corrected--Housing stop date is corrected. 30.8.2.1.8.  BAQ is corrected to substandard quarters--Housing will be stopped. 30.8.2.1.9.  BAQ is corrected to partial--Housing will be stopped. 30.8.2.1.10.  BAQ is canceled--Housing will be canceled. NOTE:  Whenever a BAQ transaction corrects housing above, housing will only be corrected if the effective date is  an  open  BAQ/housing  entry.   If  any  portion  of  a  history  entry  is  being  corrected, the housing will not be corrected, an X103 management notice will be issued, and a housing  correct  transaction  will  be  required.    Whenever  BAQ  changes  or  corrects OHA, the utility indicator  must be  verified.  The BAQ transaction  will not change a utility  code.   A  separate OHA  transaction is required if the utility indicator requires changing. 30.8.2.2.  FORMAT-IDs  44,  56,  45  and  57:  (see  Figure  30.6  through    Figure  30.7, Figure  30.12  through   Figure  30.13,  Figure  30.8  through  Figure  30.9  and   Figure 30.14 through Figure 30.15). 30.8.2.2.1.  BAQ  is  stopped--Unaccompanied  Housing  (FIDs  45  and  57)  are stopped,  but  Interim  Housing  Allowance  (FIDs  44  and  56)  continue.    An  X102 management notice is sent to the servicing FSO when housing is stopped. 30.8.2.2.2.  BAQ is changed/corrected to substandard quarters--Housing stops. 30.8.2.2.3.  BAQ is changed/corrected to partial--Housing stops. 30.8.2.2.4.  BAQ is changed/corrected to single--Housing stops. 30.8.2.2.5.  Dates in BAQ are corrected--No interface with Housing. 30.8.2.2.6.  BAQ  is  canceled--Unaccompanied  Housing  (FIDs  45  and  57)  are stopped,  but  Interim  Housing  (FIDs  44  and  56)  continue.    An  X102  management notice  is  sent  to  the  servicing  FSO  when  housing  is  stopped.  NOTE:  Since  the amount of housing allowance is directly dependent upon BAQ, it is imperative BAQ and housing remain consistent. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 541  30.8.3.  Requirements for BAQ With-dependents. 30.8.3.1.  When  there  is  no  entitlement  to  BAQ  with-dependents,  the  only  OHA entitlement  is  DUAL  OHA  (FID  45  or  57).    Input  of  regular  OHA  transactions  (FID 43 or 55) will recycle until the MMPA entry is changed or corrected, or the input is modified to agree with the MMPA. 30.8.3.2.  DUAL  OHA  is  not  payable  when  the  quarters  adequacy  code  indicates  the member  is  residing  in  government  quarters  while  receiving  BAQ  with-dependents (adequacy  code  4).    45/57XX  transactions  with  accompanied  status  of  0  will  recycle until the MMPA entry is changed or corrected, or the input is modified to agree with the MMPA. 30.9.

(b)  if the member is on a controlled tour, repay period may equal tour length but may not exceed it. (c)  if member is not serving a controlled tour, repay period may not exceed 24 months. (d)  in all cases, the repay period must not exceed DOS. (e)  in most cases, however, liquidation of the advance should not exceed 12 months. the FSO may, upon request from the me mber, advance housing allowances based on housing expenses for the member and for the dependents at the accompanied location.  (Advance housing allowances may be paid at any time during a tour of duty at the new location.  All housing expenses must be documented to include copies of leases, utility company statements, etc).  Process separate vouchers and PA03s for each advance payment for local payees.  For central payees, process separate CICS trans IDs ‘JPBB’ for each payment (see subparagraph 38-9b for a more detailed scenario of this payment process).  Transactions must reflect the proper ADV-PAY-CTCGS code of "B" (OHA) and "G" (CONUS) the combined assets allowances, and expenses of the occupants are considered. lump sum recoupment will not exceed the amount of money returned to the member by the landlord.  Any balance of an advance not returned by the landlord may be liquidated in monthly installments if desired by the member. the FSO initiates held pay or accelerates the repayment rate to ensure collection of the remaining balance. 2  member is serving an unaccompanied overseas tour 3 advance of housing allowances is requested by member married to another member 4  member and dependent vacate housing for which advance housing allowance (OHA, IHA, and BAQ) was made (OVERSEAS)   5  member  is  pending separation  from  the service 6  member requests repayment at a rate less than $50.00 per month the FSO receives a written request justifying the lesser amount.  Normally repayment will be made with the $50.00 per month minimum. 612 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 31 RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 613  Chapter 32 ENTITLEMENT RE-CERTIFICATION 32.1.

Air  Force  members  are  required  to  review  and  re-certify  information concerning  entitlement  to  Basic  Allowance  for  Housing  (BAH)  and  Overseas  Housing Allowance  (OHA).  Members  are  required  to  re-certify  the  status  of  their  dependents  at  PCS arrival,  every  four  years  for  those  who  have  not  completed  a  PCS  in  that  period  of  time,  and within 60 days prior to separation or retirement. 32.2.  Substantiating Documents: 32.2.1.  Members  receiving  BAH  for  dependents  are  required their entitlement  to  the  allowance  using  AF  Form  594,  Application  and  Authorization  to  start, stop or change Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) or dependency redetermination. to  re-certify 32.2.2.  Members  receiving  OHA,  whether  individually  or  for  dependents,  are  required  to  re-certify the  entitlement  using  AF  Form  987,  re-certification  statement  for  Basic  Allowance for  Quarters  (BAQ),  Variable  Housing  Allowance  (VHA),  Overseas  Housing  Allowance (OHA),  Cost  of  Living  Allowance  (COLA),  and  Family  Separation  Allowance  (FSA).    Cost information is required only for OHA. 32.3.  Re-certification  at  PCS  Arrival.  As  members  process  in,  they  must  provide  the information  required  on  the  AF  Form  594  or  987,  depending  on  the  allowance  to  be  paid. Members must complete the form before receiving the allowance. 32.4.  Re-certification  Prior  to  Separation  or  Retirement:  Members  whose  separation  is imminent (within 60 days) must re-certify prior to separation.  The AF Form 594 or 987 must be returned to the FSO prior to the member’s anticipated departure date.  A waiver may be granted if the member has re-certified within 6 months of the date of separation or retirement. 32.5.  Four  Year  Requirement:  Members  who  do  not  PCS  within  a  four-year  period  are required  to  re-certify  entitlement  to  the  allowance  every  four  years  in  order  to  continue  receiving it.    The  member  must  complete  either  the  AF  Form  594  (members  receiving  BAH  on  behalf  of dependents)  or  AF  Form 987 (members receiving OHA) or both.  Members  have 30 days  from date of  receipt  of  the  form  to  return  it  to  the  FSO  before  action  is  taken  to  stop  the  allowance.   See paragraph 32.7 for retention of source documents. 32.6.  FSO Action when Re-certification is Late or not Accomplished: 32.6.1.  If  a  member  fails  to  return  the  form  by  the  due  date,  stop  the  with  dependents portion  of  the  allowances  effective  at  the  end  of  the  month.    For  example,  if  a  member’s re-certification  is  due  in  September,  stop  the  higher  rate  of  the  allowances  effective  30 September.  Start  the  appropriate  lower  rate  (single  or  partial  rate)  effective  the  next  day.  Annotate a blank  AF  Form 594 or 987 (whichever is applicable)  with  the  member’s  name, SSN,  and  the  fact  that  the  member  failed  to  re-certify  and  retain  in  accordance  with paragraph 32.7 below. 32.6.2.  If  the  member  completes  the  re-certification  late,  restart  the  higher  rate  of  the allowance,  effective  the  date  the  member  completes  the  form.  Do  not  start  the  higher  rate retroactively unless the member has a statement from his or her commander that the  failure to  re-certify  was  due  to  circumstances  beyond  the  member’s  control.  If  the  member  has  a 614 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 statement to that effect, the higher rate can be established back to the day after the stop date.  Retain a copy of the completed re-certification in accordance with paragraph 32.7 below. 32.6.3.  If the member fails to re-certify even after the allowance has been stopped, notify the member  that  collection  action  will  be  taken,  effective  the  date  of  the  last  re-certification.  Provide  the  member  due  process  and,  after  60  days,  if  you  have  nothing  to  indicate  the collection would be incorrect, process a DQ to collect the overpayment over 12 months. 32.7.  Retention: 32.7.1.  For  members  whose  OHA  requires  change  due  to  the  information  provided  at  re- certification,  forward  the  completed  AF  Form  987  to  the  Housing  Office  for  review.  The housing officer will review the AF Form 987, maintain the required supporting documentation, sign the re- certification form, and return the 987 to the FSO for use as the source document for input.  For  changes  to  BAH,  use  the  completed  AF  Form  594  as  the  source  document, certifying that you have examined whatever supporting documentation the member provided. Once you have examined it, return the supporting documentation to the member (if not mailed in)  and  include  the  AF  Form  594  or  987  with  your  regular  quarterly  submission  (Records  Center  Handbook  available  on  FTP  site  for  reference)  of  source  documents  to  the DFRC. 32.7.2.  Upon receipt of the  completed AF Form 594 or 987, ensure the information  matches the MMPA and, if not, documentation to support the differences is reviewed and disposed of as directed in paragraph 32.7.1 above. 32.7.3.  DFAS provides a monthly listing identifying members who have been on station for 4 years and must  recertify dependent  status.  Contact members and have them  complete a  new form  upon  receipt  of  the  listing,  following  procedures  above.  When  the  member  recertifies BAH  entitlement  at  the  4-year  point  and  no  changes  to  the  BAH  entitlement  are  required, retain  the  594  in  SSN  order  until  the  member  has  PCSd  or  separates  or  completes  a  new form. 32.8.  Redeterminations.  For  guidance  on see Chapter 26, paragraph 26.5.2 and 26.9. redetermination  of  secondary  dependency,  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 615  Figure 32.1.

Description.  The  Air  Force  provides  certain  clothing  allowances  to  its  members.  Eligibility  and amounts  are  found  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  29,  and  AFI  36-3014, Clothing  Allowances  for  Air  Force  Personnel,  and  are  either  paid  to  the  member  or  provided in-kind.    Some  allowances  are  provided  to  all  enlisted  members,  while  others  are  provided  on an as needed basis.  For specific entitlement information, see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 29. 33.2.  Types of Clothing Monetary Allowances Authorized Enlisted Members Include: 33.2.1.  Initial and Continuing Clothing Monetary Allowances; 33.2.2.  Clothing Replacement Allowances (CRA); 33.2.3.  Extra Clothing Allowances; 33.2.4.  Civilian Clothing Monetary Allowances. 33.3.  Initial  Clothing  Monetary  Allowance  (CMAI)  for  Prior  Service  Enlisted  Members Paid  Through DJMS: 33.3.1.  Entitlement: 33.3.1.1.  Regular  enlisted  members  reenlisting  more  than  3  months  after  discharge  are entitled to a CMAI.  Enlisted members of a reserve component (AFRES or ANG) on first reporting for or on recall to active  duty  for  more than 6  months  (except  for active  duty training) are entitled to an adjusted CMAI.  The MPF reenlisting, recalling or mobilizing the  members  will  provide  the  FSO  with  the  dates  of  last  discharge,  deactivation  or demobilization  from  active  duty  and  date  of  reenlistment,  recall  or  mobilization  for determining entitlement to or for computation of the adjustment to CMAI.  Members of AFRES/ANG  units  who  are  authorized  to  retain  clothing  for  service  in  the  reserve component  will return to active  duty  with that  clothing.  These  AFRES/ANG  members will  receive  an  adjusted  CMAI  based  on  the  difference  between  the  current  value  of their clothing and the amount of the current CMAI.  When AFRES/ANG members do not have Military Pay Orders (DD Form 114) or Personal Clothing Records Female Airman (Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard)  (AF  Form  657)  or  Male  Airman  (Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard)  (AF  Form  658),  the  Reserve  component members  will  not  be  entitled  to  the  CMAI,  but  will  be  entitled  to  the  appropriate clothing replacement allowances specified (basic or standard) in DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 5.   However,  AFRES/ANG  members  can receive the adjusted CMAI at a later date if the required documentation is furnished. 33.3.1.2.  Members reenlisting with a break in  service of less than 3 months are  paid  no CMAI. However, start of either the Basic or Standard Replacement Allowance or future start dates must be established. 618 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 33.3.1.3.  Reduction  in  Force  (RIF)  officers  are  paid  total  CMAI  and  a  future  is established for the Basic Replacement Allowance based on DOE provided by the MPF to the FSO. 33.3.1.4.  When  these  members are accessed  with an E203, and a 63  future  entry  is  not present  on  the  MMPA,  a  partial  reject  will  be  issued  to  the  FSO;  error  code  UHA   (PT  input  required  for enlisted  member).   Also a 63 suspense  will  be established and if the PT is not received within 30 days, another UHA reject will be issued. 33.3.2.  FSO  Procedures.  FSO  processes  a  PT03  to  report  entitlement  to  CMAI  and establish  a  63  future  for  either  basic  clothing  replacement  allowance-initial  or  standard clothing replacement allowance.  The  PT03  transaction  generates  an  N3  memo  entry  on  the MMPA.  The  CMAI  amount  is  based  on  the  difference  between  the  current  value  of  the uniforms in the member’s possession and the current CMAI amount (see paragraph 33.3.1). 33.3.3.  Substantiating  Documents.  Accession  information  received  from  the  MPF  and DFAS-DE is used to prepare DD Form 114 and later payment using SF 1034. 33.3.3.1.  For Reservists called to active duty or ANG members enlisting for active duty, the gaining unit prepares DD Form 114. 33.3.3.2.  For  RIF  officers  in  enlisted  status  and  prior  service  enlisted  member  with  a break  in  service,  assign  an  MPO  number  to  a  copy  of  the  orders.  Verify  previous  DOS with member's copy of the latest DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty. 33.3.4.  Payment. The 6403 transaction must be input if entitlement exists and payment will be created  by the 6403 transaction.  See Figure 33.9  for 6403  format, to  include  the types  of initial  clothing  allowance.  For  additional  information  on  type  codes  to  be  used  in  the 6403, see paragraph 33.4.3 below. 33.3.5.  Input. Accession must be confirmed before processing. Each transaction is processed in separate input and limited to one of these: 33.3.5.1.  Report (03). Establishes entitlement, reports payment of CMAI, and establishes entitlement or futures for Basic and Replacement CRA, as applicable. (See Figure 33.8). 33.3.5.2.  Cancel  (06).  Completely  voids  a  previous  submission.  (See  Figure  33.8) (Will only work if input the same month as the original submission). 33.4.  Initial Clothing Monetary  Allowances  –  Basic  Military Trainees  (BMTS) and  Officer Training School (OTS) Students. 33.4.1.  Entitlement:    DoDFMR  Volume  7A,  chapter  29,  and  AFI  36-3014  (Clothing Allowances  for  Air  Force  Personnel)  provide  details  of  entitlement  for  these  allowances.  Standard initial clothing allowances are mainly provided as an in kind issue, although a cash payment may be made for items not furnished in kind. 33.4.2.  FSO  Procedures:   for the  members in paragraph 33.4.3.2  below  the 64 transaction must  be  input  by  the  field.    Upon  receipt  of  substantiating  documentation  from  clothing  (AF  For  656),  process  the  6403  transaction  using  the  appropriate  type  (see  subparagraph 33.4.3.2 for specifics). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 619  33.4.3.  Input.  The 6403 transaction will be used to pay enlisted members the cash portion of the  initial  clothing  allowance  or  the  value  of  the  initial  clothing  not  available  for  issue.  Additionally,  it  will  be  used  to  pay  the  member  for  clothing  alterations  if  required,  for secretary  of  the  service  authorized  reissues,  and  Air  Force  OTS  trainees  with  and  without prior service. 33.4.3.1.  The 64 entry will be generated as part of the accession process for BMTS and OTS students without any prior service.  No field input is necessary. 33.4.3.2.  The 6403 transaction will be generated from the accession transaction for OTS students reentering  with  prior  service.   The 6403 transaction  must  be  input  for  enlisted members who are selected to officer training school.  The initial clothing type in the entry will indicate what the entitlement was for: 33.4.3.2.1.  Type 1 is used to pay the  cash portion of the initial clothing entitlement. The effective date will be the member’s current date of entry (DOE).  The amount will be obtained from DJMS Table 030. 33.4.3.2.2.  Type  2  is  used  to  pay  the  value  of  any  clothing  not  available  for  issue. Limit of two type 2 clothing payments. 33.4.3.2.3.  Type  3  is  used  to  pay  the  amount  of  any  additional  initial  clothing expenses  (alterations/orthopedic  shoes).    The  amount  is  in  addition  to  the  initial clothing allowance amount. When a type 3 is processed a management notice XC05 (see Attachment 22) will be sent to the member’s servicing FSO for verification of entitlement.  The  type 3  must  be  processed within 6 months of current date of entry (DOE). 33.4.3.2.4.  Type  4  is  used  to  pay  for  a  reissue  of  initial  clothing  entitlement authorized by the designated service representative.  The amount may not exceed the initial  clothing  allowance  rate  for  the  service  involved.    Management  notice  XC11 (Attachment  22)  will  be  sent  to  the  member’s  servicing  FSO  for  verification  of entitlement. 33.4.3.2.5.  Types 5 and 6 are used by Navy only. 33.4.3.2.6.  Type 7 is used  to  pay the  special  initial  clothing  monetary allowance  for Air Force OTS students with a break in service or without prior service.  The amount for  the  Air  Force  special  initial  clothing  allowance  is  in  Table  030.  Only  Air  Force members can have an initial clothing type of 7. 33.4.3.2.7.  Type 8 is used  to  pay the  special  initial  clothing  monetary allowance  for Air  Force  OTS  students  selected  from  active  duty.    The  amount  for  the  Air  Force special initial clothing allowance is in Table 030.  Only Air Force members can have an initial clothing type of 8. 33.5.  Maternity  Clothing.  AFI  36-3014  provides  rates  of  maternity  clothing  allowance payable. 33.5.1.  Previously, maternity clothing was provided in-kind.  The in-kind issue was made up of  four  mandatory  items  (one  service  dress  coat,  one  skirt,  one  short  sleeve  shirt  and  one camouflage utility uniform) and  other items  selected  by the  member.  The  total  of the items 620 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 received  could  not  exceed  the  maximum  value  of  the  supplemental  allowance  for  pregnant enlisted women. 33.5.2.  Effective  1  June  1998,  the  maternity  clothing  allowance  is  again  included  in  the member’s mid-month or end-of-month pay. 33.5.3.  Responsibilities: 33.5.3.1.  SG  Community.  The  health  care  provider  is  responsible  for  providing  AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report, to the member’s Commander’s Support Staff (CSS). 33.5.3.2.  Commander  or  First  Sergeant.    The  commander  or  First  Sergeant  signs  the AF  Form 469, counsels  member  on the requirement to  purchase  the  mandatory uniform items  and  any  other  uniforms  required  to  perform  duties,  and  includes  a  statement  on the  member’s  profile  that  the  member  has  been  counseled.  The  CSS  maintains  the original AF Form 469 and forwards a signed copy to the FSO. 33.5.3.3.  FSO.    Use  the  AF  Form  469  signature  date  as  the  effective  date  for  the maternity clothing  allowance. If  the  form  is  not  dated,  use  the  date  the  finance  office receives the 469 as the effective date. 33.5.3.3.1.  Review the member’s MMPA to ensure maternity clothing allowance has not  been  paid  in  the  last  three  years.  Once  verified,  use  the  AF  Form  469  as authorization  for  payment,  and  process  a  6103  transaction,  type  8,  to  report  the entitlement for the clothing allowance. The entitlement updates the MMPA and pays the member the next available payday. 33.5.3.3.2.  If  you  process  the  maternity  clothing  allowance  using  type  B  with  an effective date of 1 June 1998, or later, which creates the NU memo entry, cancel it and process the 6103, type 8 (see subparagraph 33.5.3.3.3 below). If the effective date is prior to 1 June 1998, the existing 6103 type B is correct. 33.5.3.3.3.  Before  you  cancel  the  6103,  type  B,  ensure  the  member  does  not  have the  maternity  clothing  issued  in-kind.  If  the  member  has  received  in-kind  clothing allowance within the last 3 years, there is no additional entitlement. 33.5.4.  Substantiating Documents.  AF Form 469, Duty Limiting Condition Report. 33.6.  Enlisted Members' Civilian Clothing Allowance: 33.6.1.  Entitlement.  DoDFMR, Vol 7A, Chapter 29, and AFI 36-3014, Clothing Allowance for  Air  Force  Personnel,  provide  details  of  entitlement the  Civilian  Clothing Allowances.    These  allowances  have  a  monetary  value  which  is  included  in  the  member’s mid-month or end-of-month pay. to 33.6.2.  Substantiating Documents. 33.6.2.1.  When  members  are  assigned  to  duty  or  serve  in  a  career  field  that  has  been identified  in  the  DoDFMR,  Vol  7A,  or  AFI  36-3014,  entitlements  have  been predetermined  by  personnel.    For  members  performing  short,  non-consecutive  TDYs, when  the  number  of  days  total  at  least  15 within a 30-day period, or  over 30  within a 36-month  period,  a  letter  from  the  commander  can  authorize  the  entitlement  upgrade.  Based  on  one  of  the  items  above,  after  ensuring  the  member  has  not  received  TDY AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 621            civilian  clothing  allowance  in  the  previous  36  months,  use  one  of  the  following documents to substantiate entitlement: 33.6.2.1.1.  Assignment/reassignment orders, 33.6.2.1.2.  TDY orders, or 33.6.2.1.3.  DD Form 114, Military Pay Order, and letter from the commander. 33.6.2.2.  Members  assigned  to  duty  or  serving  in  a  career  field  that  has  not  been identified  in  either  regulation  must  have  the  entitlement  authorized  by  MAJCOM  or MAJCOM  equivalent  (unless  MAJCOM  has  delegated  civilian  clothing  determination authority to wing or wing equivalent). AFI 36-3014 contains the information necessary for  civilian  clothing  determinations.  Attach  the  determination  to  the  other  source documents provided.” 33.6.3.  FSO  Procedures.    Process  an  8103  transaction  with  the  appropriate  civilian clothing appropriate  documentation  (see paragraph 33.6.2) before processing the transaction.   FSOs  must  have the allowance type. 33.6.3.1.  Use  the  following  type  codes  (see  paragraph  33.6.2)  for  civilian  clothing allowance transactions with an effective date prior to 1 April 1998: 1  Initial civilian clothing allowance - summer and winter 2  Initial civilian clothing allowance - summer or winter 3  TDY civilian clothing allowance - for 31 days or more 4  TDY civilian clothing allowance - 16 through 30 days 33.6.3.2.  Civilian Clothing Allowance type codes for transactions with an effective date after 31 March 1998: 5  Initial 6  Career 7  TDY - 15 through 29 days 8  TDY - 30 days or more 9  Annual replacement. 33.6.4.  Civilian  Clothing  Allowance.  For Civilian Clothing  Allowance entitlement  with an effective date after 31 March 1998, the DODI 1338.18 provides for a new Civilian Clothing Allowance  entitlement  payable  to  members  whose  assignments  require  them  to  wear civilian  clothing  at  least  50%  of  the  time.    The  type  code  used  depends  on  whether  the member is assigned to a tour of predetermined length or one with an open-ended tour length. 622 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 33.6.4.1.  Initial,  or  type 5,  pays a  member  serving  on a  tour  with a  predetermined tour length.  For  type  5  transactions,  the  tour  length  field  must  not  be  blank.  Type  5 transactions,  should  not  be  processed  if  an  initial  civilian  clothing  allowance  was  paid within  36  months  for  a  tour  length  of  over  24  months  or  within  24  months  for  a  tour length  of 12  to 24  months.  Depending on the actual tour  length,  processing  the  type  5 transaction  will create  various 81 futures.  Type 5 transactions,  that create an  81  future, pay  a  replacement  allowance  on  the  one-year  anniversary  of  the  entitlement  effective date. 33.6.4.1.1.  12 to 17 months - No future or automatic follow-on payment; 33.6.4.1.2.  18 to 29 months - Creates future type A; 33.6.4.1.3.  30  to  36  months  -  Creates  future  type  B;  at  the  end  of  the  first  12 months, type B changes to type C.  Type C pays a Replacement Allowance on the second anniversary of the initial Civilian Clothing Allowance date. 33.6.4.2.  Career.  Clothing allowance type 6 is used only for members in career fields that require civilian clothing to be worn continuously (E.G., OSI investigators). 33.6.4.2.1.  Career,  or  type  6,  transactions  are  processed  with  a  blank  in  the  tour length field. 33.6.4.2.2.  The first civilian clothing allowance payment may include the initial and two  civilian  clothing  replacement  allowances  paid  at  once.    The  final  approval  for all  lump  sum  payment  of  civilian  clothing  Allowance  is  the  Assistant  Secretary  of Defense (FMP). 33.6.4.2.3.  A  career,  type  6,  transaction  made  as  a  lump  sum  payment  creates  an  81  future,  type  D.    The  type  D  future  suspends  Civilian  Clothing  Replacement Allowance for 3 years, after which it establishes a type E. 33.6.4.2.4.  When  a  career,  type  6,  transaction  is  processed  for  an  individual payment  (not  lump sum), it creates an 81 future type E.  The type E future pays and resets  itself  at  the  end  of  each  36-month  period  from  the  date  of  the  entitlement anniversary. 33.6.4.3.  Temporary  duty, 15-29 days, type 7, indicates  the  member  is required to  wear civilian  clothing  for  15-29  consecutive  days  or  a  total  of  15-29  days  within  a  30-day period. 33.6.4.4.  Temporary duty, over 30 days, type 8, indicates the member is required to wear civilian clothing for 30 consecutive days or for a total of 30 days within 36 months. 33.6.4.5.  Replacement permanent duty (annual replacement).  Clothing  Allowance type 9 is used to pay the annual Replacement Allowance.  Use this to pay the Replacement Allowance to  members  whose  assignments  were  extended  6  months  or  more  or  who  were  not automatically  paid  a  Civilian  Clothing  Replacement  Allowance  after  receiving  the  initial Civilian Clothing Allowance. 33.6.5.  Civilian Clothing Allowance (FID 81) 33.6.5.1.  Stop (02) – only deletes ‘81’ futures. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 623  33.6.5.2.  Report (03) – pays or establishes a civilian clothing allowance entitlement. 33.6.5.3.  Correct (05) – corrects previous input. 33.6.5.4.  Cancel (06) – deletes the initial payment, previous installments and any future type on the entry. 33.7.  Health and Appearance Sales: 33.7.1.  Unit  Responsibility.    Unit  commanders  initiate  health  and  appearance  sales.  These  credit  sales  are  authorized  only  to  cover  emergency  needs  of  airmen  who  are without  funds  to  purchase  items  of  personal  clothing  necessary  for  health,  comfort,  or appearance.   Use of credit sales to make up shortages for an inspection is not an emergency. Credit  sales  are  not  authorized  if  member  can  wait  until  regular  pay  and  allowances  are received.  Units contact the servicing FSO to determine if member has enough pay accrued to cover  purchase.  If  enough  pay  has  accrued,  FSO  will  make  partial  payment  to  purchase required  clothing.    If  not,  the  unit  prepares  AF  Form  656,  Clothing  Request  and  Receipt + Male/Female, to authorize the  credit  sale.   Airman  presents  form to  MCSS  when selecting  required  items.  MCSS  enters  total  of  purchases  on  form  and  returns  it  to  airman who presents it to the FSO before clothing is released.  (See AFMAN 23-110.) 33.7.2.  FSO  Procedures.  FSO  provides  information  concerning  a  member's  accrued  pay  to unit  commander  considering  health  and  appearance  sales  and  provides  partial  payment  to member when member has funds to cover purchase.  If member does not have enough funds for a partial payment, the unit  prepares  AF Form 656 to authorize a credit sale  for required clothing.  After  the  MCSS  enters  the  total  of  items  purchased  on  the  form,  the  member presents  the  original  AF  Form  656  and  all  5  copies  to  the  FSO.    Process  a  DS  against  the member's  pay  account  to  collect  the  total  charges  for  the  items  supplied  by  the  MCSS.  Retain  copies 1 and 2  of the 656 for  supporting  documentation and return the remainder to the member who then returns to the MCSS. 33.8.

Description.  Individuals serving in the grades of lieutenant general or general, or holding specified  positions  of  authority,  are  entitled  to  receive  a  monthly  personal  money  allowance.  Rates  and  conditions  of  entitlement  are  shown  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  31.  Actions to start, stop, or change personal money allowance result from event processing such as accession,  promotion,  demotion,  or  separation.    This  allowance  is  subject  to  Federal  and  State income tax withholding. 34.2.  Source  of  Input.  The  TR  entry  of  the  MMPA  is  used  to  identify  and  regulate  the personal  money allowance  for  special  compensation  positions.   Input  of  FID TR  transaction(s) to start, stop, change, correct, or cancel entitlement is done by either the member’s servicing MPF for  member’s  initial  assignment,  changes  to,  or  reassignment  from  designated  position.  Transaction  input  for  preparatory  school  student  accounts  is  restricted  to  respective  academy.  See  Figure  34.1  for  transaction  format.

Description.  PCS advance payments provide a member with funds to meet extraordinary expenses  incident  to  a  government-ordered  relocation.    It  is  intended  to  assist  with  the  out-of-pocket  expenses  that  exceed  or  precede  reimbursements  incurred  in  a  duty  location change,  and  are  expenses  not  typical  of  day-to-day  military  living.   An  advance  of  pay  shall not  be  authorized  for  the  specific  out-of-pocket  expenses  covered  by  advances of  other  pays and entitlements, if such advances are used (to include travel allowances and per diem, overseas station housing allowance, BAQ,  VHA, and dislocation  allowance). The  member's commander has  oversight  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  advance  of  pay  is  only  used  to  help  with  the financial  burden  of a  PCS.  Specific  entitlement provisions are  found in the DoDFMR,  Volume 7A,  chapter  32.    PCS  advance  pay  for  central  payees  is  paid  through  electronic  funds  transfer (EFT) by DFAS-DE.  CICS transaction ID ‘JPBB’ is used to request and ‘JPBX’ to confirm the payment. 35.2.  Substantiating Documents: 35.2.1.  DD Form 2560, Advance Pay Certification/Authorization.  (See Figure 35.2)  Each member  requesting  or  extending  the  repayment  of  an  advance  pay  to  meet  extraordinary expenses  related  to  a PCS  move  is  required  to  complete  DD  Form  2560.   The  purpose  of this  form  is  also  to  inform  the  member  of  the  purposes  and  restrictions  of  such  advances, and to establish the repayment schedule. Distribution of the DD Form 2560 is as follows: 35.2.1.1.  Original - attach to payment voucher or DTL (see paragraph 35.4 below); 35.2.1.2.  Second copy - member; 35.2.1.3.  Third copy - approving official (when applicable); 35.2.1.4.  Fourth copy - FSO retained copy. 35.2.2.  AF Form 265, FSO Payment Authorization.  (See Figure 35.1 and Table 35.1).  Used by the FSO to authorize payment of a PCS-related advance of pay for local payees. 35.2.3.  PCS orders or PCS assignment notification.  Used in conjunction with the DD Form 2560 to justify member's request to commander. 35.2.4.  DD Form 117, Military Pay Voucher.  Used to pay the advance, reported as in figure 35.6. 35.2.5.  Daily  EFT  Payment  Request/Authorization  Form.   (See  Figure  35.3  and  Table  35.2).    Used  by  the  FSO  to  authorize  payment  of  a  PCS-related  advance  of  pay  for central payees. 35.3.  Responsibilities: 35.3.1.  Commander.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  member's  commander  to  review  the  DD Form 2560 in accordance with guidelines contained in AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 6. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 641  35.3.2.  Comptroller.    The  comptroller  ensures  the  intent  of  policy  guidance  is  followed, providing guidance to commanders as needed.  For further information, see AFMAN 65-116, V2, chapter 6. 35.3.3.  FSO.  It is the responsibility  of the  FSO  to  point out any  questionable  expenses  or repayment  period,  to  the  commander,  for  possible  adjustments.    Items  which  should  be considered  questionable  include things like  certificates  of  deposit,  vacations,  stocks, bonds, etc.  Ensure  payments  to  members  who  are  enroute  are  restricted  to  properly  identified members who can prove, beyond doubt, their military pay status.  Use caution in identifying members.   Lack  of proper  identification can result in illegal  payments,  causing  exceptions against  the  disbursing  officer’s  account.    Verify  member's  status  with  either  the  losing  or gaining  station  or  DFAS-DE.    For  all  advance  payments,  ensure  member's  remaining service allows normal repayment of the advance. 35.4.  FSO Action: 35.4.1.  The  FSO  uses  the  AF  Form  265  to  authorize  payment  for  local  payees  and  Daily EFT  Payment  Request/Authorization  Form  to  authorize  the  payment  for  central  payees.  For  a  member  who  participates  in  direct  deposit,  the  FSO  will  use  CICS  trans  ID  ‘JPBB’ (see subparagraph 38.9.2 for a more detailed scenario of this payment process) to send the payment  to  the  member’s  bank  account.  This  will  cause  the  PA03  to  be  created systematically and posted to the members MMPA.  For a member who does not participate in direct  deposit,  the  FSO  will  make  the  payment  locally  prior  to  reporting  the  payment  as  a PA03.  The advance pay category for this payment is A. 35.4.2.  The DD Form 2560 is attached to the original AF Form 265 or Daily EFT Payment Request/  Authorization  Form  depending  on  the  situation,  when  a  member  requests  a  PCS advance  payment.  When  an  extension  of  repayment  period  is  requested,  subsequent  to  the advance,  the DD  Form 2560 is attached to the DTL for submission to DFAS-DE as support for the DT04 transaction. 35.4.3.  The FSO may (but is not required to) offset the amount of any subsequent advance by the unpaid amount of a prior advance; multiple DVs are allowed. 35.4.4.  Retention of Daily EFT Payment Request/Authorization Form when payment has been made by DFAS-DE using EFT.  The Confirmed Daily EFT Payment Data Report is available on  SAR,  under  JFAREG,  ID  is  FA0341D.  Two  copies  of  this  report  should  be  printed  out daily when EFT payments have been confirmed/authorized by your FSO for any one business day. Attach original Daily EFT Payment Request/Authorization Form to one copy and a copy of the EFT Form to the second copy of the report.  Enter the following note on your DTL:  “For daily EFT data, see attached listing,” and attach report with original EFT form request to your DTL.  The  DTL  gets  forwarded  to  the  Denver  Federal  Records  Center  (DFRC)  with  the quarterly document submission.  The second Daily EFT Payment Data Report is maintained at FSO level for 1 year after reconciliation (Air Force Records Disposition Schedule), provided there  are  no  outstanding  discrepancies  for  which  corrective  action  has  been  prescribed  by DFAS-JM/DE. 35.4.5.  When  a  member  receives  an  advance  of  pay  from  a  friendly  foreign  nation  and payment  is  chargeable  to  a  military  pay  appropriation  (P510  or  530),  a  copy  of  the  paid voucher must be sent to DFAS-JMS/DE for preparation of input transactions. 642 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 35.5.  Special  Provisions.  PCS  advance  payments  are  to  be  repaid  at  a  rate  of  not  less  than  one-twelfth  of  the  amounts  advanced  each  month  for  the  next  12  months,  unless  a  reduced amount  is  justified  and  approved  in  writing  due  to  financial  hardship.    (See  DoDFMR, Volume  7A,  chapter  32,  table  32-2). Members  may  make cash  payments to repay an advance partially or in full at any time.   Figure 35.1.

For AF Forms 265, the chief of Customer Service/Customer Support or designated official is not the certifying official.  His or her signature provides a means for the DDO to verify that the proper authority has approved the AF Form 265 before payment.    2.  For DD Forms 117, the FSO/agent, or designee may certify in Block 10.  The chief of Customer Service/Customer Support may be designated to sign as the certifying officer.  When the chief of Customer Service/Customer Support signs in Block 10 as the certifying officer, he or she is not required to sign in Block 16 as reviewer.  Block 16 is only completed when the reviewer is someone other than preparer (Block 15) or certifying officer (Block 10).  As prescribed in DoDFMR, Volume 5, paragraph 330502, a DDO may not be a certifying officer. When the Chief of Customer Service/Customer Support or designated official is the approving official (signs in Block 16), the signature provides a means for DDO to verify that the proper authority approved the AF Form before payment. 3.  Local payments are limited to emergency circumstances.  See DoDFMR, Vol 7A, chapter 32 for further information. 648 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Table 35.2.

During input of CICS Trans ID “JPBB” or “JPBX”, if the amount entered exceeds the established tolerance per payment, a message will appear on the screen.  When that occurs, DFAS must be notified to make that payment for the base via daily EFT. 2.  The business day for daily EFT runs from 0900 M.T. of one day to 0900 M.T. of the next day (Denver time).  Product Control Number (PCN) UH099C0341 is created on a daily basis and includes payments confirmed for a specific business day by the bases that requested payments to be sent through daily EFT.  This product is in Confirmed User ID sequence and is available through SAR on a daily basis after the payments have been released to the Federal Reserve Bank. 650 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 36 PARTIAL AND CASUAL PAYMENTS 36.1.  Description.  Transient  or  casual  payments  are  payments  made  to  members  away  from their  home  stations.    Partial  payments  are  payments  made  to  individual  members  (or  groups when  approved  by the  DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1. the  organization  commander)  at their  home  stations.   See 36.2.  Substantiating Documents: 36.2.1.  AF Form 265, FSO Payment Authorization (See Figure 35.1 and Table 35.1).  Used by the FSO to authorize payment of a PK (partial) or PC (casual).  (See Figure 36.2 through 36.3) 36.2.2.  DD  Form  115,  Military  Payroll  Money  List.  (See  Figure  36.1)  Used  to  report  a partial payment.  (See Figure 36.2 through Figure 36.3) 36.3.  Responsibilities.  The FSO ensures that the member receives only that amount accrued to date less normal deductions.  For information concerning different organizations' responsibilities relative to casual payments.  (See paragraph 36.4 below.) 36.4.  Special Provisions - Casual Payments: 36.4.1.  Members at Location Where FSO Service Is Not Available.  When a member reports to  a  duty  station  where  an  FSO  is  not  available,  he  or  she  may  request  a  casual  payment from  the  MPF,  GSU,  personnel  clerk,  commander,  or senior  military  member  in  charge, as applicable to member's specific duty location.  For members who do not participate in direct deposit,  the  payment  will  be  paid  by  the  FSO  servicing  the  member’s  duty  station.   (See  Figure  36.2  for  PC  transactions.)    Members  who  do  participate in  direct  deposit  will have  their  payment  sent  to  their  bank  account  through  the  use  of  CICS  trans  ID  ‘JPBB’  (see  subparagraph  38.9.2  for  a  more  detailed  scenario  of  this  payment  process.  After  the money has been transmitted to the bank, a payment transaction (PC03) will be systematically created to post against the member’s MMPA. 36.4.2.  Member  in Process of  Accession to the  Air  Force.  Process as  casual payment, and submit a  PC03  to  DJMS-AC.   If  the  MMPA  has  not  been  established,  the  transaction  will reject to the input source.  If the transaction rejects, verify name and SSN before following up with  the  servicing  MPF  to  determine  why  the  accession  has  not  been  accomplished.    If accession has since been accomplished, resubmit PC03 transaction using reject procedures. 36.4.3.  Member  in  Need  of  Transportation.  A  member  traveling  or  on  leave  with  delay enroute without  sufficient  funds  must contact the transportation  management  office (TMO).  The  TMO  furnishes the  member  a  cost  charge  government  transportation  request  or  ticket.  A  member  traveling  without  orders  must  be directed to  the local  order-issuing authority to obtain proper orders before being issued a transportation request (TR) or ticket. 36.4.3.1.  Documents  furnished  by  the  transportation  office  (local  payment  of  airline transportation).  The travel area sends to the military pay area: 36.4.3.1.1.  Copy of orders authorizing issuance of each cost charge ticket. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 651  36.4.3.1.2.  Copy  of  the  applicable  AF  Form  529,  Request  for  Air  Carrier  Service, showing  the  cost  of  the  ticket.  NOTE:    The  above  documentation  flows  from  the travel  section  only  if  airline  transportation  costs  are  paid  locally.    Non-local payment of airline charges are paid by transportation  operations, DFAS-IN, and are posted as a PC to the MMPA by DFAS-DE/FJF. 36.4.3.2.  Reporting  payment.    Report  a  PC  based  on  the  transportation  documents furnished  by  the  travel  section.    Submit  one  PZ  for  510  charges  and  one  PZ  for  530 charges. 36.4.3.3.  Refunds.  Refer member to the local TMO for refund information. 36.4.3.4.  Absentees  or  deserters.    Follow  the  same  procedures  as  outlined  in subparagraph  c above. 36.4.4.  Member  arrives  at  new  duty  station.    FSO  must  first  determine  financial  need  of member. Review  member's MMPA  to determine  payment data.   If  the  system is  down, use the  data  in  the  PCS  package  (if  applicable)  or  endorsed  travel  orders.  Use  casual  payment procedures  as  described  above  and  report  payment  to  DFAS-DE  promptly.    Under  no circumstances should payments to member be delayed. 36.4.5.  Casual payments to members of other services.  (See Chapter 77 of this volume.) 36.5.  Partial  Payments.  Authorized  partial  payments  may  be  made  only  under  extremely extenuating  circumstances  or  due  to  an  emergency.    The  amount  may  not  exceed  accrued  pay and  allowances  to  date  less  normal  statutory  deductions.    FSO  reports  abuses  of  partial payment  policy to  member's unit  commander.   Members  who  participate  in  direct  deposit  will have  their  payment  sent  to  their  bank  account  through  the  use  of  CICS  trans  ID  ‘JPBB’  (see  subparagraph  38.9.2  for  a  more  detailed  scenario  of  this  payment  process).  For  these payments  a  PK03  transaction  will  not  be  required  form  the  field.    The  CICS  trans  ID  will automatically  generate  one  for  each  payment.    Members  who  do  not  participate  in  direct deposit will receive their payment locally and will require the servicing FSO to input the PK03. 652 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 36.1.

One-time  pay  authorizations  are  issued  by  DFAS-DE  based  on  a  special event  or  condition  creating  entitlement  to  the  payment.    If  a  member  is  not  a  direct  deposit participant  he/she  will  be paid  locally  by  the  FSO.   Those  that  are  not  paid locally  are  paid  by the DFAS Central Site through  the electronic  funds  transfer  system (EFTS).   At  the  member’s request, those  that are  paid  locally  may  be included in the next regular paycheck through the use  of  a  special  transaction  (action  indicator  26).  One-time  payments  are  subject  to  federal and state taxation and income tax withholdings are deducted in accordance with federal and state legal requirements.  See chapters relating to specific entitlement for FID information. 37.2.  Timing of Payments.  One-time payment authorizations include the type of payment and the  effective  date  of  the  payment  as  well  as  the  net  amount  of  the  payment.   The  amount  may not be paid prior to that date under any circumstance since the event causing the entitlement must occur before the entitlement to the funds actually exists. 37.2.1.  Do not make separation payments to separated members more than 2 workdays after the  separation  date  without  contacting  DFAS-JMCBD/DE  via  E-Mail  or  calling  to  obtain  a payment control number. 37.2.2.  Arrears  of  pay  for  deceased  members  are  paid  by  DFAS-DE  and  include  any outstanding pay authorization on the MMPA.  See Chapter 54 for more detailed information. 37.3.  Procedures. 37.3.1.  Local  Payees.    One-time  pay  authorizations  received  by  the  FSO  are  routed with other DJMS-AC transactions to the FSO for production of print listings.  The printout includes a one-time pay authorization money list.  The money list is used for inserting check number data, signature information,  or  other  disposition  notations.    When  members are  not paid  one-time authorization amounts by  the recipient FSO, the  money list item is red-lined and annotated to facilitate disposition. 37.3.2.  Central Payees. For central payees the authorization for the payment will appear on a special  electronic  funds  transfer  (EFT)  file.  If  the  FSO  finds  that  the  member  should  not receive the one-time payment through EFT, Central Site (Accounting and Analysis Branch of the Military Pay Directorate) should be notified. Central Site will remove the member’s pay authorization from the special EFT file prior to transmission  of the  payment to his/her  bank account.  Central  payees  one-time  pay  authorizations  will  also  be  received  by  the  FSO  and routed  with  other  DJMS  transactions  to  the  FSO  for  production  of  print  listings.  This printout  will  include  one-time  pay  authorization  messages  for  central  payees. If a  member is  being  paid  his/her  one-time  payment  through EFT, a  message  stating  that  will appear  on this money list after the payment has been made. 37.4.  Reject Corrections: 37.4.1.  Y  Rejects.    DFAS-DE  processes  payments  and  collections  to  members'  accounts where  minimum  data  is  available  in  transactions  received.    For  example,  a  reported payment  with an  invalid voucher number is processed if member identification, amount, and AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 657  effective  date  are  available.  This  transaction  is  rejected  to  the  input  source  as  a  Y-type reject  indicating DFAS-DE  has  processed  the transaction against  the  member's  MMPA  but some  data  requires  correction  (indicated  by  the  error  code).    When  the  corrected transaction  is  submitted,  DFAS-DE  clears the reject and  the FSO  submits  an 05 transaction to correct the member's MMPA. 37.4.2.  Z  Rejects.    When  a  transaction  cannot  be  processed  because  of  missing  or  invalid minimum  data,  or  because  it  is  a  duplicate,  the  transaction  is  totally  rejected  as  a  Z-type reject.   These  rejects identify  the type of reject and  contain  error  codes.   To correct  Z-type rejects,  analyze  the  error  codes  in  relation  to  reject  type,  input  transaction  coding,  and source  documents  supporting  the  transaction.  Correct  any  source  documents  containing erroneous  codes  and  submit  the  correct  transaction  as  instructed  in  Chapter  4  of  this volume.  Correction of rejects must be made within 3 workdays after receipt of the reject. 658 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 38 DIRECT DEPOSIT OF PAY 38.1.  Description.  Direct  deposit  is  a  payment  method  to  automatically  deliver  a  member’s pay  to  a  checking  or  savings  account  designated  by  the  member.    Participation  in  the  direct deposit  program  was  mandated  by  the  Department  of  Defense  for  all  military  members  in April  1992.    Public  Law  (P.L.)  104-134,  The  Debt  Collection  Improvement  Act  of  1996, further  mandated  that  by  January  1,  1999,  all Federal  payments  be  made  by  Electronic  Funds Transfer (EFT), a form  of direct  deposit.  The new law covers all categories of DoD personnel, including  civilians,  military,  military retirees, reserve and annuitants.  The law also requires all new payments after July 26, 1996, be made by EFT. 38.2.  Enrollment.  Military members are enrolled in Direct Deposit  by  providing a SF Form 1199A, Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form (Figure 38.1), to their local military pay office.  This form is completed by the member's financial institution of choice and signed by both the member and the  financial  institution.  The  enrollment  stays  in  effect  until  the  member  changes  financial institutions  and  provides  a  new  SF  1199A  or  the  member  provides  a  written  waiver  of  direct deposit  participation  signed  by  the  commander.  If  members  already  have  an  account  with  a financial institution, the  U.S. Treasury FMS Form 2231, Faststart Direct Deposit (Figure 38.3), can  be  used  and  is  completed  by  the  member  –  no  requirement  for  the  financial  institution  to complete any part of the form.  See paragraph 38.4.3 for instructions on this form. 38.3.  Pay  Option.  Both  members  participating  in  direct  deposit  and  those  with  approved waivers have the option of receiving their pay once a month (on the first day of the month for the prior month) or twice a month (on the first of the month and the 15th of the month).  If no election is made to establish a change to pay option, all members will be paid twice each month. 38.3.1.  Use DD Form 114, Military Pay Order, to change a member's pay option from once a  month  to  twice  a  month  or  the  reverse.  Type  the  statement:  Change  of  pay  option  to once/twice  a  month  per  the  request  of  the  member.    Include  the  member's  name,  SSN, signature and date. 38.3.2.  Process LH04 to change pay option.  (See Figure 38.4) 38.4.  Substantiating Documents: 38.4.1.  SF  Form  1199A  is  used  to  substantiate  designation  of  a  member's  financial institution.    To  ensure  the  integrity  of  both  Air  Force  and  Treasury  regulations  are maintained, ensure the following actions are completed prior to processing: 38.4.1.1.  The financial institution has properly completed and signed the SF 1199A, or 38.4.1.2.  If the financial institution is outside of the local area, the member provides proof that the account  exists  (checking  account  deposit  slips,  passbook,  account  identification card,  etc.)  and  a copy of the FSO completed SF Form 1199A is mailed to the receiving financial institution within 1 business day.  Ensure the FSO address is included in section 2 of the form. NOTE:  Use voided check to determine the correct routing transit number for the financial institution.  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 659   38.4.1.3.  Complete SF 1199A as follows: 38.4.1.3.1.  Section  1,  item  A,  name  of  payee  -  enter  member's  name,  address,  and telephone number. 38.4.1.3.2.  Section 1, item B,  name  of person  entitled to payment  -  enter  member's name. 38.4.1.3.3.  Section 1, item C, claim or payroll ID number - enter member's SSN. 38.4.1.3.4.  Section 1, item D, type of depositor account - check the applicable block, checking or savings. 38.4.1.3.5.  Section  1,  item  E,  depositor  account  number  -  enter  member's  account number. 38.4.1.3.6.  Section  1,  item  F,  type  of  payment  -  check  the  applicable  block,  mil active and enter "USAF (SALARY)". 38.4.1.3.7.  Section 1, item G, used for allotments only. 38.4.1.3.8.  Payee/joint  payee  certification  -  enter  member's  signature  and  current date. 38.4.1.3.9.  Section 2, government agency name and address - enter the name of your FSO and the return address. 38.4.1.3.10.  Section  3,  routing  number  and  check  digit  -  enter  the  Financial Organization's (FI's) routing number and check digit from the company code table. 38.4.1.4.  After completion of SF 1199A, separate the form.  The program agency copy is used to process an LH01 (start)  or LH04 (change) transaction.   (See  Figure 38.4)   The company code, transaction number, and effective date must be annotated on the program agency  copy.  This  copy  is  then  used  to  support  the  LH01  or  LH04  entry  on  the  DTL. The  FI  copy  is  mailed  to  the  FI  with  a  letter  of  explanation.    (See  example  1.)    The recipient's (payee) copy is given to the member. 38.4.1.5.  If the FI determines there is an error in the routing number or account number, they  will  contact  the  FSO,  which  prepared  the  SF  1199A,  by  telephone  or  letter,  for correction or, in the case of a non-collocated FI, the FI may contact DFAS-DE/FJFBA, at 303-676-7171, or process a Notification  of Change (NOC) through the  Federal Reserve.  A  photocopy  of  the  SF  1199A  with  corrections  annotated  may  also  be  used  to  correct the MMPA.   Problems related to receipt of EFTS data should be referred to the servicing Federal Reserve office or DFAS-DE/FJFBA by the FI. 38.4.1.5.1.  Example 1: Letter of explanation to FI.  "TO:  Financial Institution The attached Standard Form(s) 1199A are for Air Force active duty members who desire to have their salary(ies) sent to your financial institution.  If there is an error in  the routing  number or account number, please contact this office for correction. Contact  may  be  made  by telephone,  letter,  or  by  returning  a  photocopy  of  the  SF 1199A with corrections annotated. 660 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Our address  is (FSO address) and  our  telephone  number is (FSO local  telephone number).  Problems  related  to  receipt  of  Electronic  Fund  Transfer  System  data should  be  referred  to  your  servicing  Federal  Reserve  office  or,  as  appropriate, DFAS-DE/FJFB, 303-676-7171."  (Local reproduction is authorized.) 38.4.2.  AF Form 1745, Address Change Form, is used to change a member's correspondence address,  check  and  W-2  address,  LES  address,  and  may  be  used  to  change  bond  mailing address(es).  (See  Figure  38.2)    The  original  is  the  DJMS  supporting  document  and  the copy  must  be  forwarded  to  the  member's  servicing  MPF  (or  unit  if  PC  III  is  used)  unless ONLY bond addresses are changed. 38.4.3.  FMS Form 2231, Faststart Direct Deposit Form (Figure 38.3) may be used to start direct  deposit  if  a  member  has  an  existing  account  at  a  financial  institution.    It  can  be found at HTTP://WWW.FMS.TREAS.GOV. Ensure sections 1, 2, 3 and 5 of this form are completed.  It is suggested that a check/sharedraft be attached by the member so the FSO can verify the correct routing indicator and account number have been entered on the form.  This form does not have to be sent to the financial institution. 38.4.4.  (DELETED) 38.5.  Waivers  to  Participation  in  Direct  Deposit.  Individuals  must  certify  in  writing  that they do not have a financial institution. 38.5.1.  For  active  duty  members,  certifications  must  be  submitted  in  writing  to  their  unit commander.  Members  should  be  instructed  to  obtain  a  checking  or  savings  account  at  a financial institution.  The length of the waiver is at the discretion of the commander, but all waivers are currently scheduled to expired December 31, 1998.  All check payments will be mailed on payday from the servicing DFAS Central Site to the member’s mailing address. 38.5.2.  For  retirees,  certifications  must  be  submitted  in  writing  to:  Defense  Finance  and Accounting Service     US Military Retirement Pay PO Box 7130 London KY  40742-7130 38.5.3.  For Annuitants, certifications must be submitted in writing to: Defense Finance and Accounting Service US Military Annuity Pay PO Box 7131 London KY  40742-7131 38.6.  Changes Requested by the Financial Institution: 38.6.1.  After receipt of the SF 1199A in cases outlined above, the FI may determine there is an  error  in  the  transit  routing  number,  account  number,  account  type,  or  account  holder's name.    The  FI  will  contact  the  FSO  shown  in  section  2  of  the  SF  1199A,  and  advise  of required corrective actions or process an NOC.  These actions  should  be taken immediately to prevent delays in use of deposit funds and do not require member's signature or approval. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 661  38.6.2.  NOCs are sent electronically to DFAS-DE by financial institutions to correct account number  or type  or  transit routing  number.   Changes  made as a result  of an NOC appear as Processed Transactions Originated By-Others (see Chapter 2  of this volume) and should be reviewed on a daily basis along with all by-others transactions. 38.6.3.  Payments  Returned  by  FIs.    If  a  direct  deposit  is  returned  by  an  FI  as  unpostable,           DFAS-DE/ FJFB will stop direct deposit for that individual unless a change has been made to the LH transaction between the time the payment was released and when it returned.  The stop will appear on the  by-other  listing  referenced  in  subparagraph  38.6.2  above.    FSOs  must immediately  contact  the  member  and  advise  that  action  is  required  to  correct  the  bank information.  If MM or EOM cutoff passes, the member will become a local payee until a new LH is processed by the FSO. 38.7.  Reimbursement  for  Bank  Overdraft  or  Failure  to  Maintain  Minimum  Balance Charges. 38.7.1.  In  accordance  with  Title  10  U.S.C.  subsection  1053,  a  member  of  the  armed forces,  who  entered  active  duty  on  or  after  1  July  1989,  (or  who  reenlisted  or  received  a regular commission on  or after 1 September 1989) and  was required to  participate  in  direct deposit,  may  be  reimbursed  an  overdraft  charge,  or a  minimum  balance  or average  balance charge,  that  is  levied  by  a  financial  institution.  This  charge  must  have  resulted  from  an administrative or mechanical error on the part of the government that  caused the  pay of the person  concerned  to  be  deposited  late  or  in  an  incorrect  manner  or  amount.  (The  term “financial institution” means a bank, savings and loan association, or similar institution, or a credit union chartered by the United States or a state.) 38.7.2.  In order for the member to apply for reimbursement, the FSO must establish a CMS case to the DFAS-AC Payroll\Nonreceipt of Check box.  Ensure the case contains:  member’s claim for reimbursement of bank charges;  copy  of the  bank  statement assessing the  charges and  showing  the  actual  deposit  date;  a  statement  of  the  FSO’s  request  to  the  member’s financial  institution  for  waiver  of  charges  (including  the  bank’s  response);  a  statement  by the  FSO  explaining  the  reasons  for  the  situation;  and  FSO’s  statement  of  any  extenuating circumstances.    If  approved,  reimbursements  will  be  included  in  the  member’s  pay.    No separate checks will be issued. 38.7.3.  Reimbursement  can  only  be  made  for  the  charges  assessed  by  the  financial organization  maintaining  member’s  direct  deposit  account.    Reimbursement  will  not  be allowed for overdraft charges from businesses (to include landlords), overdraft charges from allotments, or wire transfer fees. 38.8.  Direct Deposit and Allotments to Same Account.  Air  Force  policy  does  not  prevent a member from having an allotment and DIRECT DEPOSIT going to the same account.  However, members  should  be  advised  that  financially  it  is  to  their  advantage  to  have  all  money transferred  through  twice-a-month  DIRECT  DEPOSIT.    This  makes  half  the  allotted  amount available 15 days  earlier.  To be sure members consider this point, the  FSO should include this information  in  any  written  instructions  concerning  completion  of  SF  1199A  and/or  have  the pay  technician  ask  the  member  if  he  or  she  has  both  DIRECT DEPOSIT and an allotment to the same account.  Our objective is to be sure the member has considered the full advantages of DIRECT DEPOSIT over an allotment. 662 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 38.9.  Direct Deposit of Payments Other than Normal Payroll. 38.9.1.  One-time payments.  See paragraph 37.3 for additional details of this process. 38.9.1.1.  Initial  re-enlistment  and  separation  payments  (PQ).    These  payments  are reported  manually  by  the  FSO  via  JPBB  or  input  via  a  PQ03,  see  paragraphs  52.6 and 53.5 for additional details. 38.9.1.1.1.  Under  this  concept, the  FSO receives a PQ  pay authorization  for one  of these  types  of  payments.    In  the  case  of  the  initial  reenlistment  bonus,  use  CICS transaction  ID  ‘JPBB’  to  enter  the  appropriate  data,  based  upon  the  authorization received,  for  the  member’s  payment.  In  the  case  of  a  separation  payment,  the payment  data  is  entered  into  the  system  using  CICS transaction  id ‘JPBB’ after  the normal manual computation has been completed (see Chapter 52).                                 38.9.1.1.2.  In  either  case,  this  data  may  be  entered  into  the  system  up  to  10  days prior to  the effective  date  of the payment.   Anytime  within  that 10-day  window,  the FSO  or  designee  can  retrieve  the  member’s  payment  request  record  from  the  EFT file  at  Central  Site  using  CICS  transaction  id  ‘JPBX’  to  confirm  the  payment.    If, after  the  payment  has  been  confirmed,  it  is  discovered  that  the  amount  originally input changed, the payment  can be canceled  off the EFT  file and re-input/confirmed prior to the business day cutoff on the effective date.  After confirmation is complete, the payment will reside on the EFT file until the effective date, at which time it will be  released  to  the  member’s  bank  account  through  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank (FRB).  The effective  date for  separations is the  member’s DOS.  The effective date for  reenlistment  is  the  date  the  member  re-enlists,  and  is  not  to  be  confirmed  until member  provides  proof  of  reenlistment  to  FSO.  After  the  payment  has  been transmitted  to  the  FRB,  DJMS  generates  a  PQ03  payment  transaction  to  be  posted against the member’s MMPA. 38.9.1.1.3.  If for some reason the payment is not confirmed by the effective date, or is rejected  by  the  FSO  or  designee,  the  payment  request  appears  on  a  reject  file, available  through  CICS  transaction  ‘JPBB’  or  ‘JPBX’,  for  viewing/printing.    View the reject  file  on a daily  basis  to identify any other reasons for rejects on member’s payment requests. 38.9.1.1.4.  After  payments  have  been  transmitted  for  a  business  day,  they  are available  on  a  report  (UH099C0341,  confirmed  daily  EFT  payment  data)  for  the FSO  to  retrieve  through  Sysout  Archival  Retrieval  (SAR).    This  daily  report contains  payment  requests  for  members  for  each  business  day  (approximately  09:00 a.m. MT on  one  day to 09:00 a.m.  MT of the  next day).    Use this report as a tool to verify payment requests for a particular business day. 38.9.1.2.  Subsequent  re-enlistment installments (PL and  PM payments),  special  pay  for medical and dental officers (ASP, ISP, MSP, CRNA - PJ payments), aviator continuation pay  (ACP  -  PR  payments).    For  central  payees,  these  payments  will  be  generated  by central  site  and  paid  via  the  EFTS.    No  action  is  taken  by  the  FSO.      For  central payees, and additional information, see Chapter 37 and: 38.9.1.2.1.  paragraph 10.12 for additional details about ASP, ISP, MSP and CRNA. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 663  38.9.1.2.2.  paragraph 16.4 for additional details about ACP. 38.9.1.2.3.  paragraph 53.5 for additional details about re-enlistment installments. 38.9.2.  FSO  authorized  payments  -  advance  (PA),  casual  (PC)  and  partial  (PK)  payments.  When the  member  requires  one  of  these  type  payments,  authorized  individual  signs  on  to CICSJ3  region  and  uses  CICS  transaction  ID  "JPBB"  to  enter  the  appropriate  data  for  the member’s payment.  There is an  established tolerance  for  each type  of  payment that  finance must  not  exceed.  If,  for  some reason, that tolerance  is  exceeded,  a  message  will  appear  on the  screen.    Finance  will  not  be  allowed  to  continue  for  that  particular  payment.    Contact central  site  with  either  a  message  or  fax  in  these  cases  to  have  DFAS-PMJ/DE  make  the payments  that  exceeded  the  tolerance.    If  the  payment  is  below  the  established  tolerance, once the  data is  entered,  the  FSO  or  designee  signs  on using  CICS  transaction id "JPBX" to review the  payment request.   After review, the payment  will  be confirmed  or rejected by the  FSO  or  designee  by  entering  a  ‘y’  (yes)  or  ‘n’  (no)  in  the  appropriate  block  on  the screen.    If  the  payment  request  is  confirmed,  an  image  of  the  payment  data  is  sent  to  a file  at  Central  Site  to  be  vouchered  and  transmitted  to  the  FRB  using  EFT,  then  on  to  the member's  bank  account.    Payment  will  normally  be  in  the  member's  bank  account  within twenty-four hours.  After the payment has been transmitted to the FRB, DJMS generates a PA, PC  or  PK  transaction  to  be  posted  against  the  member's  MMPA.  If  the  payment  request  is rejected,  it  appears  on  a  reject  file at  Central  Site  for approximately  two  weeks.  There are other  reasons  that  the  payment  will  reject  at  Central  Site  even  after  the  payment  has  been confirmed.   For example, one reason is if the member's status does not allow payment to be made.   Access this reject  file through CICS  transaction id  "JPBB"  or  "JPBX" to  ensure the payment was not  rejected after input.   After  payments have been transmitted  for a business day,  they  will  be  available  on  SAR  report  UH099C0341,  confirmed  daily  EFT  payment data.   This daily report contains payment requests for members for each business day, which runs  from  approximately  9:00  a.m. MT of one day to 9:00 a.m. MT of the next day.  These times are local time in Denver, Colorado.  Use this report to verify the payment requests from the EFT payment request/authorization form for a particular business day. 664 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 38.1.

Description.  An accession transaction establishes a skeleton MMPA for members entering or reentering the Air Force after a break in service of one day or more. 39.2.  FSO Actions: 39.2.1.  Members  Requiring Accession.   Coordinate with MPF on all  members  who  do  not have  a  fully  accessed  MMPA  (Master  Military  Pay  Account).    If  the  MPF  is  unable  to submit  or  get  the accession  transaction  to  process  to  DJMS-AC  within  14  workdays  after the  member’s  arrival  at  the base,  a  CMS  (Case  Management  System)  case  must  be  set  up.  Coordinate  with  the  local  MPF  and  have  them  set  up  the  CMS  case  for  the  accession problem,  to  the  correct  folder  or  box  within  CMS  (enlisted  or  officer),  per  instructions provided them by HQ AFPC.  If the MPF is unwilling or unable to establish the CMS case, establish  the CMS case in  finance and refer to  local  MPF  employments. Make sure specific information about the member, and nature of the problem, are included in the CMS case,  to include information on the number of partial/casual payments made. 39.2.2.  Processing  Delays.    Contact  DFAS-DE/FJY  if  accession  transactions  are  not processed  or  rejected  within  7  days  after  submission.    Provide  transmission  number, transaction number and MPF ID. 39.2.3.  Input  of  MMPA  Transactions.    Require  newly  accessed  members  to  complete  all forms relating to allowances, tax  deductions, allotments, and other  pay actions affecting the MMPA.   Until the FSO  confirms that an accession  transaction  processed, use  code 3 in  the first  position  of  the  action indicator  of  all  transactions  input  for  members  entering  the  Air Force.  DFAS-DE  will recycle these transactions for 30 or 60 days if member is in a V or T status (the accession transaction cannot process until the month after the member is put in a V status  and  the  accession  transaction  is  recycled  RBM).  NOTE:  Use  of  code  3  causes  the transaction  to  recycle  until  the  accession  transaction  processes,  according  to  normal update logic.  This can cause BAS transactions to reject if member is accessed in a PCS status. 39.2.3.1.  Obtain  completed  TD  Form  W-4,  Employee's  Withholding  Allowance Certificate,  and  DD  Form  2058,  State  of  Legal  Residence  Certificate,  from  Service member  to  establish  legal  residence,  actual  number  of  exemptions,  and  marital  status.  (See  Chapter  56  for  details.)    The  FSO  where  the  member  first  reports  for  duty  must submit this information using an MG and/or applicable transactions. 39.2.3.2.  If  TAX-AUTH-CITY-STATE  is  098,  at  the  time  the  E203  processes,  the FSO will receive a UDN reject of the E2 transaction to notify the FSO that member must declare a legal residence  and  an  MG  transaction  must  be  sent  to  DFAS-DE.   A  60-day suspense  is  established  for  receipt  of  the  MG  transaction.    At  the  end  of  60  days,  the FSO  receives  a  UDN  reject  of  the  suspense  transaction  and  a  new  30-day  suspense  is established if  the  MG has  not been received.  If the 30 day  suspense is  not cleared, it is rejected to DFAS-DE/FJ for follow-up action. 39.2.3.3.  Input PT transaction for all enlisted members.  See Chapter 33. 670 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 39.2.4.  Service  Component.    The  service  component  code  is  used  to  determine  what appropriation will bear the  expense.  Service component  codes of R, G, and V  will result in a  charge  to  the  active  duty appropriation.  A  service  component  code  of  S  will  result  in  a charge to the reserve appropriation. A service component code of N will result in a charge to the guard appropriation. 39.3.  Accession Input.  Three general types of accession transactions are used.  Partial accession transactions  (EA  and  E101  only)  establish  minimum  information  as  in  paragraph  39.4.  Full accession  transactions  (E103  and  E203)  complete  the  MMPA  and  override  certain  accession data  previously  reported.  Accession  correct  transactions  (EA05  and  E205)  are  explained  in 39.3.5.  Except as noted below, all transactions place members in an A status (on station) at their permanent duty base.  Use of accession transactions by type of Service member: 39.3.1.  Basic  Military  Trainees  (BMT).    All  BMTs  entering  the  Regular  Air  Force  for enlisted  duty  are  accessed  by  Lackland  AFB  with  an  E101  and  an  E103  transaction  (for BMTs entering the Air Reserve Forces.  (See Volume III.) 39.3.1.1.  The E101  establishes MMPAs using  name,  SSN,  extended active  duty (EAD) date, and sex code and places accounts in a special "BMT" status (FID PO) which holds member's  pay  while  in  BMT.  Each  BMT  receives  three  payments  during  training: Payment at a flat rate on the second day of training (the accession (E101) is based on this payment),  a  mid-training  payment  at  a  flat  rate,  and  a  graduation  payment  for  net  pay due up to day of graduation.  AFPC match flag 7 or Z is used to establish these accounts.  (See paragraph 39.5) 39.3.1.2.  The E103 transaction contains all data necessary to complete the information in  the  MMPA,  overrides  E101  input  and  establishes  a  full  account  for  members  which initially  may  not  have  been processed  with an  E101 as in 39.3.1  above.   Graduates are not  placed  in  a  PCS  status  on  transfer  out.  Gaining  bases  process  SG03  arrival transactions  as  soon  as  the  member  arrives  to  remove  member  from  BMT  status (servicing ADSN 9998). 39.3.2.  Reenlistees.  Enlisted members reenlisting with a break in service may have either an E203 or both a EA03 and an E203 accession transaction(s) submitted to DFAS-DE: 39.3.2.1.  An  EA  transaction  submitted  by  AFPC  after  member  has  enlisted.  This transaction  contains  only  DOE  date,  grade,  sex,  prior  Service  military  department,  MPF-NR, MAJCOM ID, gaining MPF number (if member is sent to AETC for training), and  pay  date  (this  date  is  based  only  on  member's  prior  Active  Service  and  does  not consider Reserve time).  It establishes an MMPA so the FSO can provide immediate pay service to the member.  The EA transaction puts member in a PCS status with movement reason  code  I.    Reenlistment  bonuses  are  computed  and  processed  as  shown  in  the DoDFMR,  Volume  7A.  These  accounts  are  established  with  an  AFPC  match  code  6. Month-end  restructure  changes  code  to  F.  These  codes  indicate  an  E203  is  required  to confirm the accession. 39.3.2.2.  An  E203  transaction  must  be  submitted  by  the  MPF  within  2  workdays  after  in-processing  at  the  permanent  duty  station  (PDS).    This  transaction  provides  data  to complete  the  MMPA,  removes  member  from  PCS  status,  and  sets  the  match  flag  to blank.   It also overrides any data already in the MMPA. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 671  39.3.3.  Officers.  Except as noted below and in paragraph 39.3.1, the member's MPF at the first  PDS  processes  an  E203  immediately  after  member's  arrival.    AFPC  confirms  these accessions with ML03 transactions. 39.3.3.1.  Officers Performing TDY.  Officers ordered to TDY stations for orientation or training before arrival at  their  first  PDS are accessed by  AFPC  with an EA  transaction.  The  FSO  at  the  TDY  base  must  determine  whether  member  is  to  receive  full  or  partial-pay service and coordinate this with the MPF. 39.3.3.1.1.  Limited Pay Service.  Members who will be at their TDY base for a short time  are  accessed  to  DJMS  with  3333  as  SVC-ADSN  in  the  EA  transaction.  This causes  the  computer  to  access  member  in  a  PCS  status  with  servicing  and  paying ADSN  of  9999  and  a  movement  reason  code  of  I.    Payment  transactions,  FITW changes, and changes to central payments can be processed for these members at the TDY base. 39.3.3.1.2.  Full-Pay Service.   Members  who are to receive  full-pay  service from the FSO  at the TDY  base are accessed  with a  servicing and  paying  ADSN of 9999 and an  LD04  must  be  input  by  the  TDY  FSO.  Member  is  put  on-station  at  the  first permanent  duty  station  by  the  E2  accession  transaction  submitted  by  the  MPF immediately after member's arrival. 39.3.3.2.  Section  Officers  are  Air  Force  Reserve  and  Air  National  Guard  members ordered  to  extended active  duty under  provisions  of 10  U.S.C. 265, 8033, and 8496, or  32  U.S.C.  708.  MPFs  access  these  members  with  an  E203  transaction.  Refer  to subparagraph 39.2.4 for correct service component code. 39.3.3.3.  Non-Prior  Service  OTS  Students  are  accessed  with  E101  and  E103 transactions.    The  Maxwell  MPF  submits  an  E6  transaction  upon  graduation  to  update the  record  from  enlisted  to  officer  and  puts  the  member  in  a  PCS  status  (H)  with servicing ADSN of 9999. 39.3.4.  Reserve  and  Guard  Members  Ordered  to  Active  Duty  are  accessed  with  an  E203 transaction  submitted by the  MPF at their  first duty  station.  These accounts are established with  an  AFPC  match  flag  of  1;  restructure  changes  this  to  A.  AFPC  confirms  these accessions with an MM03 confirmation transaction.  This transaction  deletes the match  flag.  Refer to subparagraph 39.2.4 for correct service component code. 39.3.5.  Accession  Correct  Transactions.    Accession  correct  transactions  are  input  in  the same  format  as  report  transactions  and  contain  all  data  for  a  report  transaction.    They  are processed as follows: 39.3.5.1.  E505 transactions correct EAD date, pay date, grade and the over 4 years active enlisted and/or  warrant  officer code.   The transaction  will  process as long as the  AFPC match flag code is 6 or F, the TZ05 (officer service dates) transaction has not processed or  two  EA05  transactions  have  not  already  processed.    If  member  does  not  have  an MMPA, the transaction processes as an 03 transaction and creates an MMPA. 39.3.5.2.  E205  transactions  are  input  by  the  MPF  at  member's  first  permanent  duty station  to  correct  any  data  item  that  can  be  input  in  an  accession  transaction.    If member  does  not  have  an  MMPA  or  if  the  AFPC  match  flag  code  is  6  or  F,  the 672 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 processes transaction (See  paragraph  39.5)    The  05  transaction  will  process  unless  it  has  been  more  than 120  days  since  the  E203  processed,  two  E205  transactions  have  already  processed  or, for officers, the TZ05 (officer service dates) transaction has not processed. access  member.    transaction as an 03 to fully 39.4.  Effect on MMPA.  The first accession transaction (EA or E2) opens an MMPA to allow JUMPS transactions to process.  As a minimum, it establishes the following: 39.4.1.  Entitlements: 39.4.1.1.  Basic pay (FID 01). 39.4.1.2.  BAS for officers (FID 40). 39.4.1.3.  Personal money allowance for grades 09 and 10 (FID 41). 39.4.2.  Deductions: 39.4.2.1.  Federal income tax withholding (FITW) based on 1 exemption and single (FID FJ). 39.4.2.2.  Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA) (FID FC). 39.4.2.3.  State  income  tax  withholding  (SITW)  (for  basic  trainees  only).    For  all others TXNG-AUTH-CITY/STATE is established as 098. 39.4.2.4.  Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) (FID DB) for $100,000 (only with E2  processing).    If  member  elects  to  decline,  reduce,  or  increase  life  insurance coverage, prepare input per Chapter 63. 39.4.3.  Other.  An HO entry will be created to contain the member’s net pay until such time he/she  is  no  longer  considered  a  trainee.    The  HO  entry  is  adjusted  by  payments  and other  increases  or decreases  (entitlements,  collections,  etc.)  to  the  MMPA.  (NOTE:    the HO  entry replaces  the  PO entry.) 39.5.  MMPA Entries That Identify the Accession Process.  Three  entries  signify  accession transactions processing. 39.5.1.  FID MK History Entry (Control Dates).  The  first accession transaction  establishes this  entry  which  is  updated  by  any  subsequent  accession  action.  It  is  a  complete  history showing  the  updates  in  which  accession  actions  were  processed.    The  formats  for  these entries  are  dependent  on  whether  member  is  a  basic  trainee  or  a  non-basic  trainee.   (See Figure 39.1 and Figure 39.2 for format and explanation of data items.) 39.5.2.  FID  MJ  Entry  (AFPC  Match  Flag).    This  entry  contains  codes  that  tell  the  DFAS-DE  computer  to  look  for  certain  transactions.    Four  of  these  codes  relate  to  the accession  process  and  are  explained  below.    A  blank  indicates  that  member  is  fully accessed. 39.5.2.1.  Code 7 or Z a basic trainee has not had an E103 transaction processed.  When either  of  these  codes  are  present,  the  SG03  transaction  to  remove  member  from  basic trainee  status  recycles.  Code  Z  indicates  an  E103  is  required,  E101  accession  was  not confirmed by AFPC.  Code 7 indicates E101 was received but an E103 is required. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 673  39.5.2.2.  Code  6  or  F  member  was  accessed  by  an  EA03  transaction  but  an  E203 transaction  is  required.    These  codes  are  usually  associated  with  PCS  status.    (See  paragraph 39.3.3)   When these  match  flags are  present,  member  was  brought  on station by the E203 transaction and no SG03 transaction should be processed.  Code 6 is put  on  the  record  by  accession  processing.  After  the  first  restructure,  the  code  changes to F. 39.5.3.  SH  (PCS)  Entry.    When  members  are  accessed  by  an  EA  transaction  and  put  in  a PCS  (SH)  status,  movement  reason  code  I  is  used.    SG03  transactions  will  not  process against these accounts. The E203 transaction  puts  member in a SA  status  and  the  SH  entry closes.   No SG appears on the MMPA when the accession transaction processes. 39.6.  DFAS-DE Actions Related to Accession Processing: 39.6.1.  Grade  Differences.    If  the  E203  processes  containing  a  grade  that  is  different  from the  grade  on  the  MMPA,  an  MD05  transaction  to  correct  the  grade  is  created.  The  MD05 recycles to process in the  next update.  If  for some reason it cannot  process, it is rejected to DFAS-DE/FJ for action.  It is possible for the accession transaction to process and grade not to be updated immediately. 39.6.2.  EAD Date.  If the EAD in the E203 transaction processes and is different from what is on the MMPA, the new EAD date is entered on the MMPA.  All dates based on EAD date are  updated  other  than  those  affecting  entitlements  and  deductions  which  are  handled manually by DFAS-DE/FJ. Figure 39.1.  MK MMPA Format-Basic Trainee.

Basic  Military  Trainees  (BMT).  Normally,  when  members  are  accessed  into  the  Air Force,  other  than  OTS  graduates,  direct  accessions,  etc.,  they  are  processed  through  Lackland AFB  as  BMT.    BMTs  are  paid  through  a  separate  system  called  Trainee  Military  Pay  System (TMPS).   Procedures for paying BMTs are contained in DFAS-DEM 7073-3 40.2.  Pipeline  Students.  After  basic  training,  but  before  reaching  the  first  PDS,  a  member  is required  to  complete  specialized  training,  often  for  extensive  periods  of  time.    While  in  this training  status,  members  are  said  to  be  in  the  pipeline.    Pipeline  students  are  paid  through DJMS and, where applicable, specific procedures are contained in this volume. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 695  Figure 40.1.

Orders  directing  diversion  en  route  may  be  issued  after  a member begins travel and  before  the date  member reports  to the  base  designated  in the original  PCS  order.  Submit  an  SH04  transaction  containing  the  changed  data  to       DFAS-DE as appropriate. 41.2.3.  Travel voucher. 41.2.3.1.  Travel  Voucher  and  Attachment  .  Member  must  file  a  travel  voucher  with the  local  FSO  within  5  workdays  after  completion  of  PCS  travel  whether  or  not  cost  to government  is  involved.  This  includes  member's  temporary  duty  pending  further  orders (TDPFO).  See  AFI  65-  114  for  instructions  on  preparing  travel  voucher.  Use  data  in member's  itinerary  to  support  PCS  arrival  transaction  (see  paragraph  41.2.3.1.1  and 41.2.3.1.2 below for date depart last duty station (DDLDS) and date arrive station (DAS)). Actual  travel  time  computed  must  be  shown  on  member's  travel  voucher.  When  travel voucher  cannot be  paid immediately (for example, when  orders require amendment), use one copy of travel voucher itinerary as a substantiating document. Verification of departure and arrival  dates  may  be  made  by audit  of endorsed travel voucher and  AF Form 2095, Assignment/Personnel Action.  Verify this data periodically with local MPF/MPE to ensure accuracy of dates on travel voucher.  Bring discrepancies found to the attention of member and  MPF/MPE  for  correction.  Detailed  processing  procedures  for  leave  and  document control are in Chapter 44. 41.2.3.1.1.  Date  Depart  Last  Duty  Station  (DDLDS).  The  DDLDS  is  the  actual date the member departs the last permanent duty station (not the local area) or the first duty day after out- processing from the MPF/MPE, whichever is earlier.  NOTE:  Duty days are considered to be Monday through Friday. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 699  41.2.3.1.1.1.  If the member departs the same day as out-processing, the DDLDS is the same day as out-processing. 41.2.3.1.1.2.  When  out-processing  is  accomplished  on  Friday  and  the  member physically departs the next duty day, then that duty day is the DDLDS.  Examples: 41.2.3.1.1.2.1.  Out-processing  is  accomplished  on  Friday,  physically  departs on Monday; Monday is the DDLDS. 41.2.3.1.1.2.2.  Out-processing  is  accomplished  on  Friday,  physically  departs on Saturday; Saturday is the DDLDS. 41.2.3.1.1.2.3.  Out-processing  is  accomplished  on  Friday,  physically  departs on Sunday; Sunday is the DDLDS. 41.2.3.1.1.2.4.  Monday is a holiday or a base “down day”.  Out-processing is accomplished  on  Friday,  physically  departs  on  Tuesday;  Tuesday  is  the DDLDS. 41.2.3.1.1.3.  Member takes leave in the local  area (old PDS), the DDLDS is the next duty day after the out-processing date from the MPF/MPE. 41.2.3.1.2.  Date  Arrive  Station  (DAS)  at  the  New  Permanent  Duty  Station (PDS).  The DAS is the actual date the member arrives at the new PDS, has contacted the new Commander/Unit/MPF/MPE and is available for duty. 41.2.3.1.2.1.  If the  member takes any leave after arriving in the local area of the new PDS and the leave is approved by the new Commander/Unit, the DAS is the physical date of arrival because the member was available for duty and had to get approval  from  the  new  Commander  to  take  the  leave.  This  leave  must  be posted/accounted  for  by  the  member’s  unit  and  not  from  the  travel  voucher;  for example permissive house hunting leave. 41.2.3.1.2.2.  If the member takes leave in the local area of the new PDS without contacting the Commander/Unit, the leave is charged from the travel voucher and the DAS is the first duty day after the leave period when the member is actually available for duty. 41.2.4.  Message (confirmed with PCS orders or travel voucher, as appropriate). 41.2.5.  Hospital  admission  and  disposition  (A&D)  list.    Use  A&D  list  as  document  to support  PCS  arrival  input  transactions  for  members  arriving  at  a  service  hospital  in  a patient  status.   A&D  list  is prepared  daily  by  the  hospital.   This is a record of each person admitted to or released from the hospital.  Two copies of A&D list are processed as an MPO to inform FSO of PCS arrival. 41.2.6.  Substantiating  Documents.  New  servicing  FSO  submits  a  copy  of  member's  travel voucher to DFAS-DE  to  substantiate  PCS  arrival  transaction.    A  copy  of  A&D  list  is  used as  the  substantiating  document  for  members  who  arrive  at  a  service  hospital  in  a  patient status. 41.3.  Source of Input.  The concept of one-stop processing of members arriving and departing on PCS,  established  by  AFI  36-2906,  is  continued  under  DJMS-AC.  To  accomplish  this,  an  FSO 700 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 representative  is  included  in  the  MPF/MPE  processing  line.  Under  this  principle,  the  FSO representative must see that an MPO is completed to start or stop any item affected by PCS that is not  handled automatically.  The  FSO representative  should also inform  members that  changes  of address  for bond allotments are the  member's responsibility.  Members are  required to  complete AF Form 1745 to change address prior to PCS departure and then address changes are input by the FSO, not DFAS-DE.  See  paragraph  41.2.3.1.1  and  41.2.3.1.2 above  for  guidance on DDLDS and DAS. 41.3.1.  PCS  Departure  and  PCS  Diversion  En  Route.    FSO  servicing  losing  station submits these transactions and any other necessary corrections to original departure input. 41.3.2.  PCS Arrival.  FSO servicing gaining station submits these transactions. 41.4.  FSO Actions Upon PCS Arrival.  On arrival at: 41.4.1.  New  Duty  Station.    Submit  arrival  transaction  to  DFAS-DE  within  first  5  duty days after receipt of member's travel voucher within the FSO. 41.4.2.  Home  Awaiting  Final  Action  of  Physical  Evaluation  Board.    Submit  arrival transaction to DFAS-DE immediately after receipt of  member's travel voucher.   If  for  some reason  (member  physically  or  mentally  incompetent)  the  travel  voucher  is  not  received within 10 days of  departure, use  the member's  PCS  orders  and  compute  constructive travel days  to  submit  the  arrival  transaction.    A  correction  (SG05)  may  be  required  if  travel voucher is received at a later date. 41.4.3.  Hospital.   See  paragraph 41.2.5  and 41.4.1.   Hospital registrar  furnishes  this  data to  FSO  using  admissions  and  disposition  (A&D)  list  as  the  basic  source  document  when possible. 41.4.4.  Temporary Duty Pending Further Orders (TDPFO).  If members last TDY location, becomes the new PCS ADSN, then new FSO submits PCS arrival transaction. 41.4.5.  Academy  Graduates.    PCS  arrival  transactions  for  academy  graduates  contain  the date the member entered active duty in the DDLDS field of the SG. 41.4.6.  Correction of PCS After Arrival.  Use an SG05 transaction to correct any data item in  the  SG  including  departure  data  as  long  as  the  PCS  entries  are  in  the  MMPA.  Use  DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment  Authorization, after the  entries  have  dropped  from history.   The SG05 transaction rejects TCB after the PCS entries have been dropped. 41.4.7.  Reduction  in  CONUS  COLA  Entitlement  For  Travel  Days.  CONUS  COLA  is  not payable for the number of travel days allowed under JFTR, Volume I, paragraph U5160, for direct travel between the member's old and new PDS incident to a PCS. (See JFTR, Volume I,  paragraph  8002.)  The  travel  section  is  required  to  reflect  all  travel  days  (both  TDY  and Direct)  for  all  travel  vouchers  processed.  When  processing  SG  transactions  for  PCS arrivals that involve TDY en route or travel to or from overseas via APOE or APOD, enter only the direct travel days in the DAYS-TVL-TIME-ENTLMNT field of the SG transaction (Figure 41.5).  The difference between the direct travel days and the total travel days will be reflected  in  the  DAYS-TDY  field  in  order  to  balance  the  SG  transaction.  This  is  an administrative procedure only.  Payment of per diem for these days is not authorized. 41.4.8.  PCS Arrival Suspense.  Paragraph 41.5.1.13 describes the PCS arrival suspense. The primary reason for this suspense is to be sure that leave taken as a result of PCS is posted. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 701  41.4.8.1.  A  UH  management  notice  is  sent  to  the  FSO  on  the  15th  calendar  day  after processing a PCS  arrival  transaction  if  the  period  between  PCS  departure  and  arrival is  greater  than  days  accounted  for  from  entries  in  the  MMPA.    If  days  accounted  for from  MMPA  entries  is  greater than  period  between  PCS  departure  and  arrival,  the  UH is  sent  on processing  of the  PCS arrival transaction.   The management  notice  gives  you by entry the number of days for which the computer can account. 41.4.8.2.  After receipt of a UH management notice, 30 days are allowed for processing transactions necessary to account for the period of PCS before a reject occurs.   DAYS-PCS  41.4.8.3.  The  formula  used to  account  for equal  DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR   (DATE-ARR-STA  minus  DDLDS)  must (DAYS-TVL-TIME-ENTLMNT  plus  TDY-DAYS  plus  PROCD-DAYS-GRNTD (from  SG  entry)  plus  LV-DAYS-COUNT  (from  SB  entries  falling  within  the  PCS period)  plus  DAYS-OTHER-STATUS  (number  of  days  from  SJ,  SK,  and  SP  entries that fall within the PCS period)). the  PCS  period is: 41.4.8.4.  If  for  some  reason  our  formula  does  not  account  for  the PCS  period and all MMPA  entries are  correct, notify DFAS-DE/FJP  of  the  circumstances and ask that they clear  the  suspense.  Example:    Member  is  hospitalized  during  PCS  and  remains  in  the hospital after arrival, or any of the days are out of immediate access storage (IAS). 41.4.8.5.  In  some  cases,  there  may  be  two  or  more  PCS  entries  with  uncleared suspenses  in  the MMPA at  one time.    While  each base  is responsible  for  its own  input, the base where member is located is ultimately responsible for clearing all SG suspenses. 41.4.9.  Member  Arriving  from  OTS.    When  member  departs  OTS,  Maxwell  AFB  submits the  PCS  departure  transaction.    The  gaining  base  processes  the  PCS  arrival  transaction, covering only the period of time since the member departed Maxwell AFB, for all members arriving from OTS. 41.4.10.  Recertification. allowances complete AF Form 594 at PCS arrival.   Ensure  members  receiving  with  dependent  rate  housing 702 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.5.  Effect of PCS Arrival on MMPA.  On receipt of an SG03 arrival transaction: 41.5.1.  If PCS departure transaction has been processed, DFAS-DE: 41.5.1.1.  Generates  a  PCS  departure  correct  transaction  to  make  the  SH  entry  agree with  the  arrival  input  based  on  date  and  quarter  day  departed  and  movement  reason code  in  the  arrival  transaction.  When  this  occurs,  information  code  TCU  is  assigned processed transaction and SH or N0 entry is included in DTR extract.  NOTE:  TCU also appears  with  rejected  transactions.    No  error  code  is  generated  if  the  servicing  ADSN does  not  change.  It  is  only  an  information  code  and  has  nothing  to  do  with  the  reject. Based on TCU, recheck your SG transaction to be sure it is correct. 41.5.1.2.  Starts foreign duty pay, effective day of arrival, for enlisted members reporting for duty in an overseas area designated for foreign duty pay.  Restarts overseas extension pay for overseas to overseas PCS, if stopped by departure transaction. 41.5.1.3.  Pays  FSA-II(PCS)  for  travel  time  listed  in  PCS  arrival  transaction  if  FSA  II stopped by PCS departure processing. 41.5.1.4.  If  movement  reason  code  is  “C”,  stops  all  open  items  of  pay  except  basic pay,  BAS  (officers),  BAQ  with  dependents,  BAQ  without  dependents  for  grades  E4 over  4  and  above,  and  medical,  dental,  or  veterinary  pay  effective  day  before  member arrives  at  home  on  PCS  awaiting  final  action  of  physical  evaluation  board  proceedings (APEBP). 41.5.1.5.  Starts BAS for a  member arriving home in APEBP status, type H for enlisted personnel, starts BAQ (own right), if applicable, and starts APEBP leave (type K). 41.5.1.6.  Stops  BAQ  without  dependents  for  E4  (with  more  than  4  years'  service)  and for grades E5 and E6 on the day before the day arrived on station.  If member is an E6 or above and drawing BAQ without, BAQ will continue. 41.5.1.7.  Stops IVHA on day before day of arrival.  Starts when accompanied status and zip code are included in the transaction. 41.5.1.8.  If  rental  fair  value  is  being  deducted  on  arrival,  issues  an  X303  management notice to the servicing and losing ADSNs. 41.5.1.9.  Starts  BAS  for  member  when  subsistence  allowance  type  is  present  in  PCS arrival  transaction.    See  Chapter  25  and  DFAS-DEM  7073-2  for  BAS  guidelines.    If BAS  is  already  paying,  arrival  transaction  is  partially  rejected.    PCS  portion  of transaction is processed and  BAS portion rejected  with  error  code  TCF.   (MEMBER HAS  OPEN  BAS  ENTRY,  PCS  PORTION  OF  TRANSACTION  PROCESSED.  SUBMIT  INPUT  TO  ADJUST  BAS.)  In  these  cases,  FSO must determine  member's entitlement  to  BAS  during  PCS  period  and  submit  appropriate  BAS  transactions  to adjust  BAS  for  PCS  period  and  start  it  for  arrival  at  this  station.    If  member  is enlisted and no code is submitted in the subsistence allowance type field, partial BAS will programatically start. 41.5.1.10.  Starts  partial  BAQ  when  character  position  64,  of  the  SG03  transaction,  has code 6 or 7 included in the transaction (see Figure 41.5).  If BAQ or BAQ-DIFF entry is open  and  partial  rate  BAQ  is  started,  the  SG  entry  will  partially  reject  with  the  error AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 703  message ‘TDY’.   MBR has BAQ entry.  Only PCS portion of trans processed.  Add BAQ if necessary.  If the code is other than 41.5.1.11.  Change  with-dependent  rate  BAQ  from  unassigned  to  assigned  single government quarters, changes the BAQ assignment to 1 and the adequacy to 4 - character position 64 = 4. 41.5.1.12.  Start  without  dependent  rate  BAQ (no dependents) - character position 64 = 8. for  closest  dependent  code  R  41.5.1.13.  Start  without  dependent (member married to member, no dependents) - character position 64 = 9. rate  BAQ for  closest  dependent type I  41.5.1.14.  Stops BAS Type C (travel) if started by departure processing. 41.5.1.15.  Updates  servicing  and  paying  accounting  and  disbursing  station  numbers (ADSNs),  as  applicable,  with  gaining  ADSN  taken  from  input  source  of  the  arrival transaction. 41.5.1.16.  Checks  the  number  of  days  PCS  against  the  days  PCS  accounted  for.        (See paragraph 41.4.8 for formula.)  If the DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR are: 41.5.1.16.1.  Equal   to   D AYS -PCS,   establishes   the   SG   entry   with   a DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR-INDCTR of 2. 41.5.1.16.2.  Less than DAYS-PCS: 41.5.1.16.2.1.  Establishes  an  SG  suspense  entry  with  an  effective  date  of processing  date  plus  14  days  and  establishes  the  SG  entry  with  DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR-INDCTR of 1. 41.5.1.16.2.2.  When compared  to DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR.  If the DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR are: the  SG  suspense  comes  due,  the  DAYS-PCS  are 41.5.1.16.2.2.1.  Equal  to  DAYS-PCS,  changes  DAYS-PCS-ACTD-FOR-INDCTR from 1 to 2 and deletes the suspense entry. 41.5.1.16.2.2.2.  Unequal,  adds  30  days  to  suspense  and  sends  a  UH management notice to the FSO. 41.5.1.16.2.3.  Takes the same actions as in 41.5.1.16.2.2 above except if the days are  not  equal,  when  the  30  days'  suspense  comes  due,  sends  a  reject  of  the  SG suspense  transaction  to  the  FSO  with  error  code  TEI  (PERIOD  OF  PCS  NOT ACCOUNTED  FOR.    SUBMIT  INPUT  OR  NOTIFY  FJPA  AT  ONCE).    Also, the transaction is rejected to DFAS-DE/FJP. These actions continue every 30 days until the suspense is cleared. 41.5.1.16.3.  Greater than DAYS-PCS: 41.5.1.16.3.1.  Sends  UH03  management  notice  to  FSO  and  establishes  an  SG suspense of processing date plus 30 days. 41.5.1.16.3.2.  When  suspense  comes  due,  takes  action  as  described  in 41.5.1.16.2.3. 41.5.1.17.  Forwards pay authorization to gaining ADSN, if member is paid locally. 704 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.5.1.18.  Sends gaining FSO all LES data that has accumulated since member departed old duty station and an image of all transactions processed against  member's account since he  or  she departed.  Based on this data, FSO reviews member's account to  ensure that  all  appropriate  PCS pay actions  have  been taken.  Review PCS  package  if  member has one. 41.5.1.19.  Generates  XA03  management  notice  to  notify  MPF  of  member's  PCS arrival.   The dates  in  the  XA notice are  matched against  dates in the  personnel  file and a  report  on  individual person (RIP) is  produced if  dates  do  not  match.   These RIPs are sent to Military Pay if the MPF finds that their dates  were input  correctly.  The military pay  area  must  determine  the  cause  of  the  discrepancy  and  take  corrective  action  if necessary.    These  discrepancies  must  be  brought  to  the  attention  of  the  member's commander, except when the discrepancy occurred as a result of administrative  error  or difference in reporting between the FSO and MPF. 41.5.1.20.  Charges  member permissive PCS move. leave  for  PCS  period  when  member  completes  a 41.5.1.21.  Stops TDY ADSN, if present in MMPA, and if member is locally paid, issues a cancel pay authorization to TDY ADSN. 41.5.1.22.  Removes  member  from  basic  trainee  status,  if  applicable,  and  restores payment control to DFAS-DE. 41.5.1.23.  Changes  data  in  SG  transaction  and/or  assigns  error  code  to  processed  or partially rejected transactions.  These are: 41.5.1.23.1.  If date departed CONUS is in transaction and: 41.5.1.23.1.1.  LE  entry  indicates  member  was  CONUS  and  no  country  or   non-CONUS  state  code  is  in  transaction,  assigns  partially  rejected  transaction error  code  TBC  (MBR  DEPRT  CONUS  CNTRY  OR  NON-CONUS-STATE MISSING.   SUBMIT LE05 OR SG05 TRANSACTION AS NECESSARY). 41.5.1.23.1.2.  LE  entry  indicates  member  was  NOT  CONUS  and  country  or   non-CONUS  state  code  is  in  transaction,  assigns  partially  rejected  transaction error  code  TCW  (MMPA  AND  TRANS  SHOW  MBR  NON-CONUS  TO  NON-CONUS.  DATE DEPARTED OR ARRIVED CONUS ZERO-FILLED). 41.5.1.23.1.3.  If  no  country or  non-CONUS  state  code is in transaction, assigns partially  rejected  transaction  error  code  TDP  (MMPA  SHOWS  MBR  WAS NON-CONUS.  ARR-DEPRT-CODE  CHANGED  TO  A.   SUBMIT CORRECTION IF NECESSARY). 41.5.1.23.2.  If date arrived CONUS is in transaction and: 41.5.1.23.2.1.  LE entry indicates member was CONUS and: 41.5.1.23.2.1.1.  Country  or non-CONUS  state  code  is  in transaction, assigns partially  rejected   tra nsaction  error  code  TDO  (MMPA  SHOW S  MBR WAS  CON US.  ARR-DEPRT-CODE    CHANGES  TO  D.    SUBMIT CORRECTION  IF  NECESSARY). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 705  41.5.1.23.2.1.2.  No  country  or  non-CONUS  state  code  is  in  transaction, assigns  partially  rejected  transaction  error  code  TCV  (MMPA  SHOWS MBR  CONUS  TO CONUS.  SUBMIT CORRECTION IF NECESSARY). 41.5.1.23.2.2.  LE  entry  indicates  member  was  NOT  CONUS  and  country  or   non-CONUS  state  code  is  in  transaction,  assigns  partially  rejected  transaction error code TCW.   (See 41.5.1.23.2.1.2 above.) 41.5.1.23.3.  If date arrived or depart CONUS is not in transaction and: 41.5.1.23.3.1.  LE  entry non-CONUS state code is in transaction, assigns partially rejected transaction error code TDG (TRANS  AND  MMPA  SHOW  MBR  DEPRT  CONUS.    SUBMIT SG05  WITH  DATE  OF  DEPARTURE). indicates  member  was  CONUS  and  country  or           41.5.1.23.3.2.  LE  entry  indicates  member  was  not  CONUS,  assigns  partially rejected  transaction  error  code  TDH  (MMPA  AND  TRANSACTION  SHOW MBR  ARRIVED  CONUS.    DATE  ARRIVED  CONUS  OF  DDLDS  PLUS  1 DAY SUPPLIED.   SUBMIT SG05 TO CORRECT DATE AS NECESSARY). 41.5.1.23.4.  If any of these  data items  in  SG  transaction do  not agree  with tables at DFAS-DE,  a  code  is  supplied:  DUTY-CNTRY  or  DUTY-NON-CONUS-STATE  is changed (DUTY-CNTRY  OR  DUTY-NON  CONUS-STATE-INVALID.   CHANGE TO US) is assigned processed transaction. to  US  and  error  code  TDC 41.5.1.23.5.  If  date  of  departure  and/or  arrival  falls  within  a  period  of  leave  other than  first  or  last  day,  transaction  partially  rejects  with  error  code  TCQ  (LEAVE ENTRY  CONFLICTS  WITH  PCS  DEPARTURE  OR  ARRIVAL  DATE.  SUBMIT CORRECTION AS NECESSARY). 41.5.1.23.6.  If  member  is  in  a  T  status  with  status  suspension  reason  other  than  1, transaction  partially  rejects  with  error  code  TCR  (MEMBER  IN  A  T  STATUS. SUBMIT CORRECTION IF NECESSARY). 41.5.1.23.7.  If  open/delinquent  (PX)  pay  authorization  (PQ,  PL,  PM,  or  PJ)  is present, transaction partially rejects with error code TEM.  Clear open/delinquent pay authorizations.  (See Chapter 53.) 41.5.1.24.  Closes HI entry created for local payees.  Pay is released into net pay. 41.5.1.25.  Stops IDP, IDP  with CZTE,  CZTE only and HFP  Leave Carryover using the effective date of the SG arrival date minus 1 day, if the start date of IDP and/or CZTE is after the PCS departure (i.e., TDY enroute) 41.5.1.25.1.  If effective date of arrival minus one day is earlier than current calendar month, the 23 and FL are stopped and updated immediately. 41.5.1.25.2.  If  effective  date  of  arrival  minus  one  day  is  in  the  current  calendar month, a 23 future is created with a type ‘G’, effective date of arrival minus one day. Stop date is at the end of the calendar month of the effective date of arrival minus one day, processed on the 1st day of the next calendar month.   For example, if a member departs  971215,  the  effective  date  is 971215, but the stop  date is 971231, processed on 980101. 706 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.5.1.25.3.  For CZTE only (no IDP), if effective date of arrival minus one day is in the same month as the FL  start  date, it is not  stopped.  The transaction  will partially process  with  error  code  TCC,  ‘PCS  transaction  processed.    Determine  if  CZTE should be stopped or corrected.’ FL future is created, effective date of stop is date of arrival minus one day, stop date is end of month of arrival. 41.5.1.25.4.  If IDP and/or CZTE entries are closed and an SH03 processes, stop dates will  be  corrected  (to  earlier  dates  only)  and  X906  management  notice,  ‘PCS PROC-VERIFY  BS  ARR/DEP  HFP  DATES-NOTIFY  DFAS  FOR  ADJ’  will  be issued. 41.5.1.25.5.  The associated BS and FL entries are updated with a departed HFP area date of SG arrival date minus 1 day if needed.   If the BS entry should be closed, it will be closed. (NOTE:  A BS entry will not always be present). 41.5.1.25.6.  If  IDP  is  closed,  date  will  be  corrected  to  SG  date  of  arrival  minus one day if needed. 41.5.1.25.7.  If  the  BS  entry  has  been  closed,  an  X906  management  is  issued.  X906 “PCS  PROCESSED-VERIFY  BS  ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE   DATES-NOTIFY DFAS  FOR ADJUSTMENT”. states 41.5.1.25.8.  If  HFP  entry  is  closed  and  the  date  start/date  stop  entry  does  not  agree with  the  SG03  dates,  and  X905  states  “PCS  PROCESSED.    VERIFY  AND CORRECT 23, FL, AND/ OR BS ENTRIES”. 41.5.1.26.  Termination or correction actions for IDP, IDP with CZTE and CZTE only can be  processed  during  PCS  processing.  See  Chapter  13  for  IDP  and  IDP  with  CZTE.   See Chapter 56 for CZTE. 41.5.2.  When  PCS  departure  transaction  has  not  been  received,  DFAS-DE  takes  these actions: 41.5.2.1.  Except for OTS graduates who have not been promoted or demoted, generates an  SH03  transaction  from  data  in  SG03  transaction.    SH  and  SG  transactions  are processed  under  normal  processing.    A TCS (SH transaction generated from SG, arrival processed  within  7  days  of  departure)  or  a  TCT  (SH  transaction  generated  from  SG, arrival  processed  more  than  7  days  after  departure)  is  generated  to  the  losing  FSO. NOTE:  Once the SG transaction is processed at DFAS-DE, the losing FSO can no longer process an SH transaction. 41.5.2.2.  If member is in OTS (MPF-NR ZB MAJCOM-ID OJ and grade E-5 or higher), the  SG  transaction  recycles  awaiting  transaction  to  separate  and  reenter  or  demote member.  Processing: 41.5.2.2.1.  Issues  management  notice  XW separation/reentry or demotion transaction. to  MPF  ZB requesting  a 41.5.2.2.2.  Recycles  arrival separation/reentry or demotion transaction. input  every  3  days,  waiting  for  processing  of 41.5.2.2.3.  If  transaction  is  not  received  in  21  days,  rejects  SG  transaction  to  DFAS-DE/FJ for follow-up action. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 707  41.6.  FSO Actions Upon PCS Departure: 41.6.1.  The  FSO  must  be  certain  that the  MPF is  giving  members a copy  of the clearance information  sheet,  Servicing  Your  Military  Pay,  on  member's  initial  processing  for  PCS departure.    The  FSO  should  also  be  sure  member  is  advised  of  the  importance  of contacting  the  FSO  and  any  special  actions  that  may  be  required  because  of  the  local situation. 41.6.2.  FSO is responsible for advising members of the impact of PCS, to include PCS with TDY en route, on their military pay and allowances. 41.6.2.1.  Chapter  42  and  individual  entitlement  chapters  contain  specific  information pertaining to conditions of entitlements.  Advise member of the impact of PCS and PCS with TDY en route for more than 30 days on the following: 41.6.2.1.1.  BAQ (see Chapter 26). 41.6.2.1.2.  VHA (see Chapter 31). 41.6.2.1.3.  OHA (see Chapter 30). 41.6.2.1.4.  COLA (see Chapter 28). 41.6.2.1.5.  FSA I and II (see Chapter 27). 41.6.2.2.  Advise  member  what  entitlements  will  terminate  upon  processing  arrival transaction at gaining FSO. 41.6.2.3.  Advise  members  who  will  be  TDY  en  route,  and  otherwise  entitled  to  single rate  BAQ,  that  the  entitlement  to  the  allowance  terminates  if  they  temporarily  occupy government quarters at any  one  location  for  more  than  30  days.   Also,  advise  them  to notify the TDY FSO if they find themselves in this situation.  Emphasize the importance of  timeliness  in  having  their  pay  accounts  updated,  to prevent  future  complications and ensure timely processing of the arrival transaction by the gaining FSO. 41.6.3.  On  member's  first  visit  to  the  FSO  before  PCS  departure,  (normally  45  days),  the FSO must  set up suspense on the pending PCS to make sure that, if a PCS package is to be prepared, the package is  ready  prior  to  member's  departure and the  member  is  instructed to hand-carry  all  necessary  documents  to  the  next  base.  (Ref  subparagraph  g  below  for  items required  to  be  hand-carried.)  Ensure  all  FSO-authorized  payments  are  posted  before  PCS departure to prevent possible overpayment. 41.6.4.  Sheppard  AFB  MIMSO  students.  Medical  corps  officers  entering  active  duty,  who attend  the  Sheppard  AFB  non-basic  trainee  officers'  course,  are  authorized  payment  of contract agreements upon  graduation  since  normal  PCS  movement  is  not  involved.    The Sheppard  AFB  ACF  letter,  DJMS  Accession of Non-basic Trainee Officer, will be used in lieu of DD Form 2572.  This letter documents payments made and should be reviewed before making additional payments. 41.6.5.  The  member  should  be  aware  of  the  importance  to  change  addresses  for  all allotments and bonds.  (See paragraph 41.3) 708 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.6.6.  The FSO must provide the member with the option of receiving his or her leave and earning statement (LES) while in a PCS status.  See  paragraph 7.10.4  for options available to the member. 41.6.7.  DD  Form  2572,  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  Package  Transfer  Actions.  DD  Form  2572  (see  Figure  41.2)  should  be  prepared  for  all  members  who  are  local payees.    Additionally,  members  with the  following documents are required to  hand-carry a DD Form 2572: 41.6.7.1.  Indebtedness  documentation  for  members  whose  debts  have  been  suspended because  of  remission  applications.  (Should  include  debt,  remission,  and  financial statement documentation.) 41.6.7.2.  Dependency determination or re-determination documents. 41.6.7.3.  Separation or retirement orders, AF Form 350, or "What-If" print. NOTE:  For members choosing to come to a stateside base for separation or retirement, include a copy of  appropriate  documentation the separation/retirement. the  FSO  processing for  presentation to 41.6.8.  Members  with  dependents,  departing  PCS for  an  overseas  duty  station unaccompanied, whose dependents live in  Alaska, Hawaii, the District  of  Columbia,  or any of the  other 48  states,  should  be  briefed  during  out-processing  that  they  may  be  entitled  to continue  receiving  housing  allowances  for  their  dependents  in  the  states,  while  they  are overseas.   Ensure  that  the  zip  code  in  the  states,  while they  are  overseas.   Ensure  that  the zip  code  in  the  66  entry,  generated  by  the  SH03  processing,  is  the  correct  zip  code  for dependents’  residence  while  member  is overseas.  If the member is  going to receive OHA at the overseas location, process a 68 transaction, using the zip code of your location, in order for  the  OHA  to  process.    Because  the  68  will  be  closed  by  the  SH03  processing,  when dependents do not relocate, contact DFAS-DE/FJPA to restore the member’s rate protection.  If  dependents  relocate,  the  gaining  FSO  must  process  the  68  and  the  member  loses  rate protection. 41.6.9.  Ensure  member  has  been  briefed  on  the  Temporary  Lodging  Expense  (TLE) entitlement provisions as part of the PCS out-processing. 41.6.10.  PCS  Departure.    The  FSO  servicing  member's  losing  base  submits  PCS  departure input to DFAS-DE within 30 days of the projected departure date.  Make every effort to use a projected departure date that is as close to the actual departure as possible and to submit the transaction  to  DFAS-DE  at  least  15  days  in  advance.    This  is  necessary  to  cut  down  on payroll  suppressions for personnel departing around payday.  Special instructions are: 41.6.10.1.  PCS With TDY En Route: 41.6.10.1.1.  Temporary  Duty  Pending  Further  Orders  (TDPFO).    Submit  regular PCS  departure  transaction  using  TDY  ADSN  as  gaining  ADSN.    If  member  has more  than  one  TDY  specified  in  his  or  her  orders,  show  the  last  TDY  point  as training  location  (ADSN).    This  applies  if  member  will  remain  at  the  intermediate TDY points less than 30 days. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 709  41.6.10.2.  PCS  to  Hospital  in  Patient  Status.    FSO,  MPF,  and  hospital  must  establish special  priority  procedures for AEROMEDVACS.  These members arrive at their  new  station  the  same day they  depart or  day  after.  So  that  member  can  receive  best  possible  pay  service,  PCS  departure transaction must be processed immediately. for  processing  PCS  departure transaction 41.6.10.3.  Member  Departs  for Home  Awaiting  Final  Action  of  Physical  Examination Board. Submit departure transactions for this member as for normal PCS. 41.6.10.4.  Member  Departs  for  OTS.  Process  a  PCS  departure  transaction  for  all members going to Maxwell AFB for OTS.  Maxwell AFB will in-process these members, via  an  SG03  transaction,  and  become  the  servicing  FSO  during  the  period  of  the  PCS departure transaction. 41.6.10.5.  Academy  Graduates.  USAF  Academy  graduates  are  assessed  as  being  on station at the Academy.   The  Academy  submits a  PCS  departure transaction  to transfer member out on EAD date. 41.6.10.6.  Out-processing  on  day  of  departure.    When  a  member  performs  any  out-processing functions on the day of departure, the SG03 transaction will indicate that the  day  of  departure  is  a  day  of  TDY  (DAYS-TDY  field)  for  administrative  purposes.  Payment of per diem for this day is not authorized. 41.6.10.7.  PCS  on  Appellate  Review  Leave.  Submit  departure  transactions  for  this member as for normal PCS.  When the FSO is notified by the member of PCS, normally 30 to 45 days prior, the following actions will be taken: 41.6.10.7.1.  Review  member's  MMPA  for  any  open  or  suspended  debts.    Re-compute  the  repayment  rate  to  ensure  maximum  two-thirds  rule  deduction  is being applied.   Change any deductions accordingly. 41.6.10.7.2.  Include  information  copies  of  any  transaction  to  change  repay  rate  in member's PCS package, if applicable. 41.6.11.  Movement  Reason Code E.   Use  movement reason  code  E  only  when travel  fund citation cites  project  5769.OZ  or  5869.OZ.   Projects  are  used  only  for  members  going  to an  organization  which  has agreed to  reimburse the  FSO  for  member's  services.   When this movement  reason  code  is used,  verify  fund  citation and  send a  copy  of  member's orders  to DFAS-DE/FJF.  (See Figure 41.1) 41.7.  Effect of PCS Departure on MMPA: 41.7.1.  PCS Report Transaction (SH03).  (See Figure 41.6)  On receipt of a PCS departure transaction, the processing actions depend on the projected departure date: 41.7.1.1.  If the projected departure date is equal to or earlier than the processing date, the transaction is processed at once. 41.7.1.2.  If  the  projected  departure  date  is  later  than  the  processing  date,  an  NO memorandum  entry  is  established  with  the  data  from  the  departure  transaction,  and  the transaction  is  recycled  to  process  on  the  projected  departure  date  unless  the  departure date falls on or between cutoff date and payday. 710 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.7.1.3.  When the projected departure date  falls on or between cutoff date and  payday, the  SH03  is  processed  immediately  (both  input  and  recycled  transactions).    This procedure  is  followed  to reduce the number of  payroll  suppressions at base level.  Input transactions  received  between  cutoff  date  and  paydate  with  projected  departure  dates falling  between  theses  dates  are  recycled  and then  processed  on the projected  departure date. 41.7.1.4.  SH03 transactions received after an NO entry is established will delete the NO entry  and  process  in  accordance  with  the  above  guidelines.    The  original  SH03 transaction will not process, as it no longer agrees with the NO entry. 41.7.1.5.  Transactions that are recycled are put through all edits possible and those that do not pass the edits are rejected.  If member's status determinant at time of recycle would cause a reject, an  XI50  management  notice  is  issued  instead  of  a  reject.    This  notifies the  base  that  member's  MMPA  status  will  cause  the  SH03  transaction  to  reject  if  the status  is  not  changed  before  the  projected  departure  date.    Before  a  member  departs PCS,  the  FSO  verifies  his  or  her  status and, if other than on station (SA), adjusts to SA or annotates the member's management case file (MCF) as to status upon departure. 41.7.1.6.  If  the  member  is  a  local  payee,  an  HI  entry  is  created  when  the  SH03  is actually  processed  (date  of  departure  is  current  date  or  earlier).    The  HI  entry  will contain the member’s net pay until the member arrives at his/her new duty station and an SG03 transaction is processed. 41.7.2.  PCS  Change  and  Correct  Transaction  (SH04  and  SH05).   (See  Figure  41.6)   The actions  taken  on  processing  depend  on  whether  the  PCS  report  transaction  is  recycling  or processed.  If the report transaction: 41.7.2.1.  Is recycling, the SH04 or SH05 transaction updates the NO entry and creates an updated  SH03  transaction  which  recycles  to  process  on  the  projected  departure  date.  The  original  SH03  transaction  will  not  process  since  it  no  longer  agrees  with  the  NO entry. 41.7.2.2.  Has  processed, the  SH04  or  SH05  transaction updates the  open  SH  entry and adjusts  any  other  entries  affected  by  PCS  departure  as  appropriate.  This  includes entitlements.  The  projected departure  date in  the SH05  can  not  be  greater than 30  days from current date. 41.7.3.  PCS  Cancel  Transaction  (SH06).    (See  Figure  41.6)    If  the  SH03  transaction  has not  processed,  the  cancel  transaction  deletes  the  NO  entry.    This  causes  the  recycling transaction  not  to  process.  If  the  SH03  transaction  has  processed,  the  cancel  transaction restores  member's  account  to  show  the  same  data  as  before  the  PCS  transaction  was processed.    If  IDP,  with  or  without  CZTE,  or  CZTE  only,  has  been  stopped  by  PCS processing, an X905 management notice will be issued.   The X905 states:  ‘PCS processed.  Verify and correct 23, FL and/or BS.’ 41.7.4.  Actions  DFAS-DE  Takes  Automatically  on  Processing  a  PCS  Departure  Report Transaction (SH03): 41.7.4.1.  Puts member in H (PCS) status. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 711  41.7.4.2.  Stops these entitlements as of 2400 the day before the day of departure: 41.7.4.2.1.  COLA, 41.7.4.2.2.  OHA, 41.7.4.2.3.  VHA, 41.7.4.2.4.  BAQ: 41.7.4.2.4.1.  Partial rate, 41.7.4.2.4.2.  Without-dependent rate, grades E-1, E-2, E-3 and E-4 (with less than 4 years' service). 41.7.4.2.4.3.  Without  dependent  rate  for  inadequate  quarters  (adequacy  code  2) regardless of grade. 41.7.4.2.5.  Enlisted BAS 41.7.4.3.  Stops these entitlements as of 2400 of the day departed: 41.7.4.3.1.  Flight pay for non-crew members, 41.7.4.3.2.  Foreign duty pay, 41.7.4.3.3.  Flight deck, overseas extension pay and diving duty pay, 41.7.4.3.4.  FSA-I, 41.7.4.3.5.  FSA-II. 41.7.4.4.  Starts these entitlements on the day of departure: 41.7.4.4.1.  IVHA, if VHA was stopped by PCS departure. 41.7.4.4.2.  IVHA is established with the same zip code as VHA. 41.7.4.4.3.  Travel BAS for enlisted (type C), if movement reason code is not T. 41.7.4.4.4.  BAQ without dependents is started from SH03 for E4 over 4 and above.  If  member  was  assigned  to  single  government  quarters,  receiving  BAQ  with dependents,  the  assignment  code  is  changed  to  “2”  and  the  adequacy  to  “0”.  Dependent  rate  BAQ  will  start  only  when  partial  BAQ  was  stopped  by  PCS processing. 41.7.4.5.  Sends a cancel pay authorization to servicing FSO for locally paid personnel. 41.7.4.6.  Updates servicing and paying ADSNs to 9999 as applicable.  If gaining ADSN in  the  SH  transaction  is  the  same  as  the  servicing  ADSN,  the  servicing  and  paying ADSNs are not changed to 9999. 41.7.4.7.  If projected arrival date is invalid or less than DDLDS, it is changed to DDLDS plus 30 days and  processed  transaction is assigned  error  code TDB.   If  gaining  ADSN does  not  match  ADSN  table  at  DFAS-DE,  it  is  changed  to  9999  and  processed transaction is assigned error code TCY.  Projected arrival date must include time for TDY en route. 712 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.7.4.8.  Generates  an  XI06  management  notice  to  the  losing  FSO,  7  days  before  the projected DDLDS,  for  recycling  SH03  transactions,  or  immediately  whenever  an  SH03 transaction  is  processed.   This  notice informs the FSO that the PCS transaction  will  or has  processed.   A “Y”  in character  position 63  of the  processed  SH03 indicates that an XI06 management notice has been generated. 41.7.4.9.  Establishes  an  arrival  suspense  entry  of  projected  arrival  date  plus  15  days.  When the suspense matures, an XI03 management notice is issued to the gaining ADSN for the processing of the PCS arrival transaction.  The XI03 is issued every 15 days until the SG03 is processed. 41.7.4.10.  If member is going PCS from OTS and has not been promoted to grade 01 or demoted to grade 34 or below, the SH transaction recycles RAT and the MPF receives an XW  management  notice.    If  member's  normal  grade  is  35  or  higher  and  member  is eliminated  from  OTS,  the  FSO  notifies  DFAS-DE  by  message  to  manually  process  the PCS transaction. 41.7.4.11.  The  PCS  departure  transaction  does  not  affect  member's  MPF  or  MAJCOM ID.  These data items are changed independently by an LG transaction from the MPF. 41.7.5.  Effect  on  IDP,  IDP,  with  CZTE,  and  CZTE  only.    Since  IDP  and  CZTE  are paid/effective for whole months only, they cannot be stopped until after the month the stop is effective. 41.7.5.1.  If  effective  date  of  arrival  minus  one  day  is  earlier  than  current  calendar month, the 23 and FL are stopped and updated immediately. 41.7.5.2.  If effective date of arrival minus one day is in the current calendar month, a 23 future is created with a type ‘G’, effective date of arrival minus one day.  Stop date is at the  end  of the  calendar  month  of  the  effective  date  of  arrival  minus  one  day,  processed on  the  1st  day  of  the  next  calendar month.    For  example, if a  member  departs 971215, the effective date is 971215, but the stop date is 971231, processed on 980101. 41.7.5.3.  For  CZTE  only  (no  IDP),  if  effective  date  of  arrival  minus  one  day  is  in  the same month as the FL start date, it is not stopped.   The transaction will partially process with  error  code  TCC,  ‘PCS  transaction  processed.    Determine  if  CZTE  should  be stopped or corrected.’   FL future is created, effective date of stop is date of arrival minus one day, stop date is end of month of arrival. 41.7.5.4.  If IDP and/or CZTE  entries are  closed and an SH03 processes, stop dates  will be  corrected (to earlier dates only) and X906 management notice, ‘PCS PROC-VERIFY BS ARR/DEP HFP DATES-NOTIFY DFAS FOR ADJ’ will be issued. 41.8.  Effect of Other Status on PCS: 41.8.1.  PCS  Departure.    PCS  departure  rejects  to  input  source  with  error  code  ZBG  if member  is in one of these statuses:   AWOL, deserted, missing, or voidable enlistment.  If a member is in any other status, PCS departure transaction processes as in paragraph 41.7. 41.8.2.  PCS Arrival: 41.8.2.1.  Failure  to  Report  At  Gaining  Base  and  Later  Arrival.    Losing  unit  is responsible  for  member  until  member  reports  to  new  unit.   (See  AFI  39-2911,  chapter AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 713  7.)  Thus, if a member is determined to be AWOL, losing MPF submits a regular AWOL input.    If  member  reports  to  new  station,  an  on-station  transaction  to  remove  AWOL status must be processed by the MPF  before processing of SG transaction.   Under these circumstances,  on-station  change  transaction  returns  member  to  a  PCS  status  in  the MMPA. 41.8.2.2.  PCS With a Period of AWOL.  A period of AWOL, which occurred during time a member was in a PCS status, must be reported. 41.8.2.3.  PCS  Arrival-Member in a Confined  Status.   When a  member is  in a  confined status  on PCS  arrival,  PCS  arrival  input  does  not  start  any  entitlements  except  those  in paragraph 41.5 for members home awaiting physical evaluation board proceedings. 41.8.2.4.  Cancel PCS Member in an AWOL, Confined, or Deserted Status.  If a member is in one of these statuses when a PCS cancel transaction is received, process PCS cancel transaction in normal  manner.    When  PCS  cancel  is  processed,  entitlements  stopped  by departure transactions are not restarted. 41.9.  PCS  Processing.  Losing  FSO  can  input  transactions  for  personnel  who  are  in  a  PCS status as indicated: 41.9.1.  Entitlement.  Entitlement transactions can be input for periods before PCS departure and will process except: 41.9.1.1.  Format-IDs  39  and  40  for  action  indicator  03,  05,  and  06  can  be  processed by losing base until member arrives at new duty station.  Action indicators 01, 02, and 04 will not process. 41.9.1.2.  Format-IDs  49,  51,  and  65  process  as  long  as  dates  do  not  overlap  PCS departure date. 41.9.1.3.  Format-ID  35  processes  if  date  departed  in  the  SH  is  within  35  days  of   DFAS-DE processing date, or if member is in PCS status. 41.9.2.  Allotment,  collection,  deduction,  FICA/FITW,  or  payment  transactions  can  be input while member is in PCS status. 41.9.3.  Specific  Transactions  From  Other  Categories.  LD,  LH,  ME,  MD,  MG  (only  when movement  reason  code is I),  MH, N8, E5,  E7, and  E8  can  be  input  for  members in a  PCS status as indicated. 41.9.4.  Forwarding  Transactions  to  New  Base.    Send  any  transactions  that  cannot  be processed by losing base, after member departs, to member's new duty station for processing. 41.9.5.  Number of Records Required.  All PCS transactions require a one-record input. 41.10.  Special Provisions.  Do not submit PCS input transaction to DFAS-DE for: 41.10.1.  Member Declared Mentally Incompetent.  For detailed procedures, see Chapter 50. 41.10.2.  Member  Placed  in  an  Excess  Leave  Status  To  Attend  School.    When  a  member is  in  an  excess leave status without pay and allowances to attend school, records remain at base  since  member  can  return  to  on-station  when  school  is  not  in  session.    For  detailed procedures, see Chapter 44. 714 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 41.10.3.  Member PCS Without PCA to Port  for Immediate Separation.   (See Chapter 52.)  When  member  is  transferred  to  other  than  a  port  for  separation,  PCS  departure  and  arrival transactions must be submitted. 41.10.4.  Reenlistees and Officers Reporting for Duty at a TDY Base.  Enlisted personnel who reenlist  in  the  Air  Force  after  a  break  in  service  and  officers  who  report  to  a  TDY  base before  going  to  their  first  duty  station  are  accessed  via  an  EA03  transaction  from  AFPC.  This transaction puts member in a PCS status with movement reason code I.  Do not submit PCS  arrival  transactions  for  these  members.    E203  accession  transaction  removes  these members from PCS status. 41.10.5.  Basic  Trainees.    Lackland  does  not  submit  SH  transactions  for  basic  trainees.  Gaining base must submit an SG03 for these members in all cases.  (See Figure 41.5 for SG format.) 41.11.  Geographically  Separated  Units  (GSU).  When  a  member's  duty  station  is  not  at  the same location  as  servicing  FSO,  a  message  based  on  normal  substantiating  documents  may  be sent  to  the  FSO  to  support  PCS  departure,  PCS  arrival,  and  other  PCS-related  changes.

TDY  processing  is  similar  to  event-oriented  transactions,  such  as  PCS.  A TDY ADSN is recorded on the MMPA so that a TDY FSO may give regular pay service to a member in TDY status. 42.2.  Substantiating  Documents.  Use  DD  Form  114,  Military  Pay  Order  (MPO),  or  TDY orders  processed  as  an  MPO.   (See  Figure  42.1)   For  checks  to  financial  organizations,  use SF 1199A,  Direct Deposit Sign-Up Form.  (See Chapter 38.) 42.3.  Effect on MMPA: 42.3.1.  Start TDY ADSN (LD01).   (See Figure 42.2)   This transaction puts a TDY ADSN on the MMPA and can be submitted only by the member's TDY ADSN.  An LD01 transaction should be submitted for all members TDY to a location for more than 30 days, and desiring pay service by the TDY FSO; for example, receipt of LES at the TDY location.  When a TDY ADSN is established on a member's MMPA: 42.3.1.1.  The TDY ADSN (LD) entry on the MMPA can 42.3.1.1.1.  change paying ADSN; 42.3.1.1.2.  change level of payment from central to local or vice versa; 42.3.1.1.3.  start,  stop,  and  report  pay  and  allowances  accruing  to  the  member while  at  the  TDY  station.    (BAS  start  will  not  process  unless  member  is  in  a permanent change of station (PCS) (SH) status.); 42.3.1.1.4.  start or stop allotments. 42.3.1.2.  The member's LES and NPA go to the TDY base. 42.3.1.3.  Only a subsequent TDY ADSN can submit an LD04 transaction to change from the old to the new TDY ADSN. 42.3.2.  Stop  TDY  ADSN  (LD02).    (See  Figure  42.2)    Either  the  servicing  or  the  TDY ADSN can submit this transaction.  It stops TDY action on the MMPA and, if the member is being paid locally by the TDY base, issues a cancel pay authorization to the TDY ADSN and returns the authorization to the member's servicing FSO.  If the member is PCS, TDY en route, paying  ADSN  is  changed  to  9999,  and  the  PI  entry  is  established.    Either  the  servicing  or TDY ADSN stops pay and allowances accruing to the member while TDY and started by the TDY ADSN using the effective date in the LD02. 42.3.3.  Change TDY ADSN (LD04).  (See Figure 42.2)  Only the gaining TDY ADSN can submit  this  transaction.    It  changes  the  TDY  ADSN  on  the  MMPA  and  results  in  a management  notice  (XM)  to  gaining  servicing  ADSN.  If  the  member  is  locally  paid  at  the TDY  point,  this  transaction  causes  the  system  to  issue  a  cancel  pay  authorization  to  the original TDY ADSN and sends a new pay authorization to the new TDY ADSN if an LB04 is received, otherwise paying ADSN is changed to 9999 until receipt of an LD02.  The gaining TDY ADSN stops pay and allowances accruing to the member while TDY and started by the original or prior TDY ADSN using the effective date in the LD04. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 723  42.3.4.  Change  Paying  ADSN  (LB04).    (See  Figure  7.10)    If  member  is  PCS,  TDY  en route,  this transaction  changes  paying  ADSN  from 9999 to the TDY  ADSN and results  in an appropriate pay authorization and the closing of the PI entry. 42.3.5.  Start  or  Stop  Payment  to  Bank  (LH01  OR 02).  See  Chapter 38,  Figure 38.4  for input screens.  Use these transactions when a member is paid centrally and wishes to be paid locally or vice versa. 42.3.5.1.  If  the  member  is  PCS,  this  transaction  changes  paying  ADSN  to  9999  and establishes the PI entry on the member's MMPA.  After this transaction has processed, an LB04 (change paying ADSN) transaction is required to establish the TDY ADSN as the paying ADSN. 42.3.5.2.  If  member  is  a  local  payee  and  paying  ADSN  is  other  than  9999,  this transaction results in  a  cancel  pay  authorization  to  the  paying  ADSN  and  the  member is  established  as  a  central payee.   If  paying  ADSN  is 9999,  this transaction  results in cancellation  of  the  PI  entry  on  the  member's  MMPA  and  the  establishment  of  the member as a central payee. 42.4.  FSO Actions: 42.4.1.  Before TDY.  Advise  members of the  impact that TDY  will  have  on their pay.  The most commonly affected allowances are: 42.4.1.1.  FSA II.  (See Chapter 27.) 42.4.1.2.  Hardship Duty Pay – Location.  (See Chapter 18.) 42.4.1.3.  COLA.  (See Chapter 28.) 42.4.2.  At Departure: 42.4.2.1.  Submit  transactions  to  stop  appropriate  entitlements  not  accruing  to  the member while TDY. 42.4.2.2.  Prepare the  member's  PCS  package if applicable for transfer and give it to the member to hand-carry to the TDY FSO.  Instruct the member as to the importance of the management  case  file  and  advise  members  to  check  with  FSO  on  arriving  at  and departing  from  the  TDY  station.  Chapter  79  contains  special  instructions  regarding deployment. 42.4.2.3.  If  TDY  is  in  conjunction  with  a  PCS  movement,  the  servicing  FSO  should process the SH03. 42.4.3.  Member Returns From TDY: 42.4.3.1.  If TDY ADSN has been established, obtain the PCS package from the member and  submit  an  LD02  using  the  date  in  the  travel  voucher  as  the  effective  date  to  stop TDY.   This  input  is  necessary  only if an  X7  management notice  has  not  been received.  The X7 is proof that the TDY ADSN input the LD02 to stop TDY.  Pay and allowances which  were  started  in  conjunction  with TDY are  stopped  based  on input  from the TDY ADSN. 724 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 42.4.3.2.  Upon receipt of the travel voucher (per  AFI 65-114), use the voucher and DD Form  114  as  a  source  document  to  submit  the  transactions  to  start,  stop,  or  change appropriate TDY  entitlements,  except  those  that require  separate  certifications (i.e., DD Form  1561  for  FSA).    All  adjustments  should  be  made  per  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A and the JFTR. 42.4.3.3.  An  SG03  with  an  effective  date  one  day  before  the  arrival  date  is  computer-generated if the TDY ADSN did not process an LD02.  Permanent duty station (PDS)  processes  an  SG03  if  the  member  was  PCS,  TDY  en  route,  when  he  or  she arrives at the PDS.   This computer-generated LD02 contains a management notice MNY to the PDS requesting they review the propriety of the effective date supplied.  If the date is invalid, act to correct the effective date and pay and allowances. 42.4.4.  TDY FSO Actions: 42.4.4.1.  Arrival at TDY Station--Member To Receive Pay Service: 42.4.4.1.1.  Obtain the member's PCS package if applicable. 42.4.4.1.2.  Input  an  LD01  using  the  proper  effective  date.    For  enlisted  members who  are  accessed  and  go  TDY  for  training  at  ATC  bases  before  reporting  to  their PDS,  the  accession  transaction  establishes  the  MMPA  with  an  LD  entry  and  the paying  and  servicing  ADSN  as  9999.  This  allows  the  TDY  FSO  to  service  these members  the  same  as  other  TDY  members.  For  all  other  personnel,  enlisted  or officer,  who  go  on  active  duty  with  extended  TDY  before  reporting  to  their  first PDS, the TDY FSO must input the LD01 to establish themselves as the TDY ADSN and furnish the member's pay service. 42.4.4.1.3.  If  the  member  desires  local  payment  at  the  TDY  station,  prepare  and input an LB04 to change paying ADSN.  (See paragraph 42.3.4) 42.4.4.1.4.  Submit input to start appropriate entitlements accruing to the member as a result of TDY. 42.4.5.  Member departs TDY Station: 42.4.5.1.  Submit transactions to stop appropriate entitlements accruing to the member. 42.4.5.2.  Submit an LD02 to terminate TDY ADSN. 42.4.5.3.  Prepare  the  management  case  file  for  transfer  and  give  to  the  member  to  hand-carry to the PDS or next TDY station. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 725  Figure 42.1.

Description.  Upon  member's  entry into the  Air  Force, on-station  status is  established.  It remains in effect until changed by subsequent status input. 43.2.  Substantiating  Documents.  AF  Form  2098,  Duty  Status  Change,  is  the  basic  source document  used  to  return  a  member  to  on-station  status.  Member's  unit  prepares  and  numbers  AF Form 2098 (Figure 43.1) and sends it to the MPF. 43.3.  Responsibilities.  The  source  of  input  for  on  station  (SA)  transactions  is  dependent  on the status from which member is being removed. 43.3.1.  Servicing  FSO.    The  servicing  FSO  must  submit  a  DT04  transaction  to  restart  any suspended  DF  (indebtedness)  resulting  from  an  AWOL,  confinement  (type  1  or  6),  or desertion status. 43.3.2.  MPF.    The  MPF  is  responsible  for  submission  of  SA  transactions  to  remove  a member  from  bad  status (AWOL (J),  confinement (K)  or  deserter (P)).   SA transactions to remove a  member  from bad status always recycle for 10 days to allow the TI05 transaction with  the  commander's  determination  of  bad  time  to  be  processed  first.  The  SA  transaction recycles  with  error  code  RDD  and  generates  an  NW  entry  on  the  MMPA.  The  NW  entry contains the SA transaction and alerts anybody looking at  the record  to the fact that the  SA transaction has been received. 43.3.3.  DFAS-DE.    DFAS-DE  is  responsible  for  input  of  SA  transactions  to  remove  a member from missing (M) and mentally incompetent (U) status. 43.4.  FSO Actions: 43.4.1.  Actions Required When Absentee Returns to Same Duty Station: 43.4.1.1.  Return  of  Absentee  Before  Management  File  Is  Sent  to  DFAS-DE.    Advise DFAS-DE by input transaction of member's return to on-station or other status.  See the chapter in  this volume  that  pertains  to the  specific  status,  from  which  member  is  being returned  to  on-station,  for  specific  procedures.    Do  not  transfer  management  file  to DFAS-DE. 43.4.1.2.  Return  of  Absentee  After  Management  File  Is  Sent  to  DFAS-DE.  FSO advises  DFAS-JMCBC/DE  by  phone  or  CMS  case  of  member's  return  and  requests current  status  of  member's  account.  Give  member's  name,  SSN,  and  accounting  and disbursing station number (ADSN)  of  servicing FSO.  DFAS-DE  forwards management file  and  new pay  authorization  to  the  FSO  if  member  elects  local  payment.    FSO  may pay  member a  partial  payment that  does  not exceed amount due.  (See Chapter 36.)  If member  is  reassigned  before  management  file  is  received  from  DFAS-DE,  send management file to member's gaining FSO upon receipt.   728  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 43.4.2.  Action Required When Absentee Reports to Station Other Than Last Duty Station: 43.4.2.1.  Notice of Member's Return to Military Control.  If an absentee reports at other than  last  duty  station,  office  to  whom  member  reports  notifies  MPF  of  the  reporting station at once. 43.4.2.2.  Actions  by  FSO at  Station  Where  Member Has Reported.  MPF  advises  FSO, who  in  turn  advises  DFAS-DE,  by  phone  or  CMS  case,  of  member's  return  and member's  current  status.  Provide  DFAS-DE  member's  name,  SSN,  date  returned  to military control, and ADSN of the FSO. 43.4.2.3.  Actions  by  FSO.    FSO  may  pay  member  a  partial  payment  as  stated  in subparagraph  43.4.1.2  above.    Review  MMPA  printout  and  submit  any  input transaction for required adjustment actions. 43.5.  Effect on MMPA.  (See Table 43.1 and Table 43.2) 43.6.  DFAS-DE Actions.  DFAS-DE forwards management file, if available and an updated pay authorization to new FSO if member requests local payment.  If management file is not available, DFAS-DE queries  old  station and  requests it be  forwarded to  new  servicing  FSO.   If unable to locate  management  file, DFAS-DE advises  the new FSO to establish a temporary  management file. 43.7.  Input.  The SA  transaction  is effective  with the  first  full  day in an  on-station  status.  For status  SJ,  SK,  SP,  SM,  day  of  return  to  on-station  is  considered  first  full  day  in  an  on-station status.   See Figure 43.2 for SA input screens. 43.7.1.  Action  Indicators.    Specific  action  indicators  are  prescribed  to  input  on-station status.   Their use  and  effect  are  explained  in  Table 43.1.   For  ACTN-INDCTR  04,  enter date  member's  status  started.    For  ACTN-INDCTR  06,  Date-Start  must  be  same  as transaction being canceled. 43.7.2.  Status Codes: 43.7.2.1.  On-station-code A. 43.7.2.2.  AWOL-code J. 43.7.2.3.  Confined-code K.  (See Chapter 47 and Attachment 14 for types.) 43.7.2.4.  Leave  (excess)-code  B.

Submit  separate  transactions to start  other  items  of  entitlement and allotment.  See  specific chapters in this volume regarding preparation of input transaction.  734 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 44 LEAVE 44.1.  Description.  Leave  accounting  is  an  integral  part  of  DJMS.    The  MMPA  contains  a record of the member's leave account which includes the number of days taken, departure and return dates, type of leave, leave balance, etc.   Leave balances are automatically adjusted at the beginning  of  each  month  to  include  leave  accrued  for  the  new  month.    The  leave  balance  is found in the BR entry on the MMPA. 44.2.  Substantiating Documents: 44.2.1.  AF  Form  988,  Leave  Request/Authorization,  (Figure  44.2),  is  the  substantiating document  for  most  leaves.    Part  I  of  the  form  is  received  when  a  member  requests  leave.  Part III  is received when a member returns from leave.  Leave types and codes are listed in paragraph 44.8. 44.2.1.1.  Reviewing  and  Coding.  AF  Form  988  is  reviewed  for  proper  preparation  and signatures. It is then encoded for DJMS transaction input. 44.2.1.2.  Disposition.    AF  Form  988  is  the  substantiating  document  for  leave  data entered  on  the  MMPA.    Part  I  is  attached  to  the  document  transmittal  list  (DTL)  and sent to DFAS-DE.  When processing a leave request for excess leave, no special action is required. 44.2.2.  AF  Form  985  for  travel  generated  leave  is  prepared  by  the  Travel  Section  in conjunction  with  the  travel  settlement  voucher.    The  PCS  orders  are  the  substantiating documents  for  leaves  generated  by  PCS.    Travel  generated  leave  types  are  listed  in paragraph 44.8. 44.3.  Responsibilities: 44.3.1.  General  FSO  Responsibilities.    The  FSO  is  the  functional  manager  for        base-level  leave accounting.  As such, the FSO must monitor the performance of supported units,  including  geographically  separated  units  (GSUs).  The  FSO  must  either  conduct  an annual  assistance  and  inspection  visit  or  obtain  self-inspection  checklists,  certified  by  the commanders  of  those  supported  units.    Finance  trains  the  unit  leave  monitor  (ULM)  and alternates on their roles and responsibilities in managing the leave program and on the use of LeaveWeb  (LW)  prior  to  issuing  them  unit  administration  access  to  LW.    This  includes briefing  the  ULM  personnel  to  inform  the  FSO  when  they  leave  the  unit  or  are  no  longer assigned  as  the  ULM.  If  checklists  are  used  and  they  show  the  unit  is  functioning satisfactorily,  an  FSO  visit  would  not  be  necessary. self-inspection  checklist,  the  FSO  determines  the  unit  needs  assistance,  the  FSO  must establish a follow-up to ensure problems are  corrected.  Either a follow-up visit by the FSO or a letter  from  the unit  commander indicating that  problems were corrected will suffice.  If the unit does not provide a certified checklist to the FSO, the FSO must obtain a checklist or visit the unit.  Those units whose performance is substandard should be provided assistance or inspections on a monthly or more frequent basis until performance is satisfactory. The  FSO should  document  either  that the unit  visits  were  performed  or that  checklists  were  obtained and also document training of newly assigned leave clerks.  (A memo for record or an entry   However,  if through the             AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 735  in a log would be sufficient to document a visit; a copy of the commander certified checklist could  document  that  the  checklist  was  obtained.)  NOTE:  See  Figure  44.3  for  Sample Checklist. 44.3.2.  Military Pay Section: 44.3.2.1.  Is responsible for DJMS input, control, processing, and quality examination as outlined in Chapter 1. 44.3.2.2.  Follows common DJMS documentation and processing procedures as outlined in Chapter 2. 44.3.2.3.  Is responsible for control of terminal leave. 44.3.2.3.1.  Maintains AF Form 1486, Unit Leave Control Log.  (See Figure 44.1) 44.3.2.3.2.  Receives  request  for  leave  authorization  number  from  unit,  verifies  that requested  number  of  days  terminal  leave  will  not  exceed  leave  balance  on  date  of separation, and issues the next leave authorization number. 44.3.2.3.3.  Performs  necessary  follow-up  actions  to  make  sure  terminal  leave requests are processed. 44.3.3.  Travel  Section.  Ensuring  that  the  travel  section  computes  travel-generated  leave, prepares AF Form 985, Report of Travel Time/Leave (JUMPS) and inputs the DJMS leave transactions.    If  the  leave  is  taken  during  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  travel,  the military pay  section is  provided with  a  legible  copy  of  the  PCS  voucher  and  AF  Form  985 to use  for inputting the  change of  station (SG03) transaction (DFAS-DER 7010-3, part six). Separate leave source documents are not required. 44.3.4.  Non-Duty  Hours  Emergency  Leave  Control.  FSO  establishes  local  procedures  for preparation  and  control  of  AF  Form  988,  Leave  Request/Authorization,  when  member must  depart  during non-duty hours.  Procedures provide for approval of AF Form 988 by the commander,  designated  representative,  or  the  duty  officer  in  a  consolidated  24  hour function  (OD,  SDO,  command  post,  etc.).  Administrative  control  procedures  will  be established  to  make  certain  the  AF  Form  988  is  sent  to  the  member's  commander  or supervisor and ultimately to the FSO.   A  document control log  may be required. 44.3.5.  Retention of the Daily Register of Transactions (DROT).  DROTs are retained at the military pay subject matter areas for 6 months after the end of the month in which the DROT was  created  per  Air  Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule.  The  FSO  subject  matter  areas (travel, military pay, etc.) are not considered unit input sources for DROT retention purposes. 44.4.  FSO  Actions.  AF Form 988 processing: Part I of  AF Form 988 is sent to the FSO  when requested leave has been approved.  Part III is sent to the FSO when previously requested leave is  to  be  canceled  or  when an adjustment to leave dates is  necessary.  The  following  provisions apply to most leave processing. (Supplemental procedures for special conditions are contained in paragraph 44.6) 44.4.1.  Leave Request.  Receive Part I of AF Form 988.  Process SB01 transaction.   Attach Part I of AF Form 988 to the DROT. 44.4.2.  Leave Departure. No Action. 736 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 44.4.3.  Change to Leave Date or Leave Extension.  Process as a leave correction. 44.4.4.  Early  Leave  Return.    Receive  Part  III  of  AF  Form  988.    Process  as  a  leave correction (SB05 transaction).  Attach Part III to DTL. 44.4.5.  Leave  Canceled.    Receive  Part  III  of  AF  Form  988  marked  "canceled"  and  signed and dated by the supervisor.  Process SB06 transaction.  Attach Part III to DTL. 44.4.6.  Leave Correct.  If an  SB51  contains an  error,  but  no SB02 or  SB03 has been input, process  an  SB05  transaction  to  update  PSF  suspense.    (See  Figure  44.9)    If  an  SB02  or SB03  has  been  input,  process  an  SB06  transaction  to  cancel  the  erroneous  entry  and another SB03 to report the correct period of leave. 44.4.7.  Transaction  Rejects.    Receive  SB01,  SB02,  etc.  rejects  from  either  base-level system  or DFAS-DE.  Correct transactions and re-input. 44.5.  Effect of Leave on MMPA: 44.5.1.  General.    Leave  accounting  is  an  integral  part  of  the  DJMS.    The  MMPA  is  a record  of  the  member's  leave  account  which  includes  the  number  of  days  taken,  departure and return dates, type of leave, leave balance, etc.  Leave balances are automatically adjusted at  the  beginning  of  each  month  to  include  leave  accrued  for  the  new  month.    The  leave balance is found in the BR entry on the MMPA. (See Figure 44.4) 44.5.2.  Effects  of  Leave  Transactions  on  the  MMPA.  Leave  transactions  adjust  the  leave balances  on  the  MMPA.    Pay  and  entitlement  adjustments  are  made  when  necessary depending on the leave type taken.   When a leave start is posted to the MMPA, adjustments are  based  upon  the  projected  return  date  or  separation  date.    The  following  may systematically occur: 44.5.2.1.  Under normal conditions when the system receives a leave start transaction, an NB  suspense  entry  is  created  on  the  MMPA.    The  transaction  recycles  until  the  start date.    On  the  start  date  an  SB01  entry  is  created  on  the  MMPA  and  the  transaction recycles  until  the  projected  stop  day.    If  a  leave  correction  is  received  the  recycling transaction and the NB suspense entry are changed to reflect the corrected information.  On the date of return from leave, the leave transaction comes out of recycle, posts to the MMPA as an SB03, and the NB suspense entry is deleted. 44.5.2.2.  When a leave involves excess leave, terminal leave, or leave awaiting appellate review,  the  transaction  recycles  until  the  start  date.  The  system  then  posts  the  leave transaction (SB01) to the MMPA on the start date, deletes the NB suspense entry, adjusts the leave  balances,  and adjusts  pay  when  necessary.    When  the  member  is  on  terminal leave,  leave  awaiting  appellate  review,  or  leave  awaiting  physical  evaluation  board processing, the leave is stopped by DJMS upon separation. 44.5.2.3.  Excess leave stops pay, entitlements, and leave accruals.  For members with an expiration  term  of  service  (ETS)  date,  the  system  calculates  the  maximum  number  of leave days that the member can accrue through the ETS date.   Any excess leave periods over  the  maximum  accrual automatically  changes the  member's  MMPA  to excess  leave status  on  the  date  the  advance  accruals  expire.    For  members  without  an  ETS  date, excess  leave  is  charged  based  on  the  amount  of  excess  leave  input  in  the  leave transactions.  Adjustments  are  made  when  the  leave  return  transaction  (SB03)  is AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 737  processed.    Any adjustments  for  excess leave (non-accrual)  would  be  made upon return from excess leave.  Further information on excess leave collections is in Chapter 70. 44.5.2.4.  Entitlements  of  pay  and allowances  may  be  automatically  adjusted  depending upon the type and length of leave and the area in which leave was taken.  Entitlements that may be adjusted are: 44.5.2.4.1.  Basic Allowance for Housing. 44.5.2.4.2.  Basic Allowance for Subsistence. 44.5.2.4.3.  Basic Pay. 44.5.2.4.4.  Cost of Living Allowance. 44.5.2.4.5.  Diving Duty Pay. 44.5.2.4.6.  Foreign Duty Pay. 44.5.2.4.7.  Hostile Fire Pay. 44.5.2.4.8.  Sea Duty Pay. 44.5.2.4.9.  Station Housing Allowance. 44.5.2.4.10.  Meal Deductions. 44.5.2.5.  An  entitlement  to  Cost  of  Living  Allowance  (COLA)  with  dependents  and Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) may require FSO adjustment as follows: 44.5.2.5.1.  Cost  of  Living  Allowance  (COLA)  with  Dependents  is  stopped  when DJMS receives  a  transaction  indicating  the  member  returned  to  CONUS  on  leave, for any  days in excess  of  30  consecutive  days.   If  the  FSO  determines  that  one  or more  of  the  dependents  remained  in  the  overseas  area,  a  one-time  adjustment transaction  must  be  input  by  the  FSO  to  reinstate  the  entitlement  for  the  period  of leave.  (See Chapter  28  for  input  format.)  The  entitlement  to  COLA  does  not  stop when a member goes on leave outside of CONUS.  No adjustment is necessary. 44.5.2.5.2.  Servicemen's Group Life Insurance (SGLI) is stopped only if the member declines coverage during extended periods of excess leave. 44.5.3.  Leaves Generated By PCS: 44.5.3.1.  PCS  leaves  are  generated  on  the  MMPA  by  the  PCS  (SG)  transaction.    The PCS  orders are the substantiating document.  There are two types of leave generated by PCS: 44.5.3.1.1.  Awaiting  Physical  Evaluation  Board  Processing  (APEBP): type  -  'K';  occurs  when  the  movement  reason  code  in  the  PCS  transaction  is  a  'C'.  The leave is chargeable until any accrued balance is depleted, after which it becomes non-chargeable.  The  member  continues  to  receive  pay.    The  leave  begins  the  day after the member arrives home, or the day after constructive travel ends, whichever is earlier.  The leave is terminated by the separation transaction. leave          738 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 44.5.3.1.2.  Permissive  PCS: leave type  'B'; occurs  when the  movement reason  code in  the  PCS  is  'F'.  The  leave  is  chargeable.  The  leave  period  begins  the  day  of departure  and  ends  the  day  before  arrival  at  the  member's  new  permanent  duty station.  If  dates  of  departure and arrival are the same, no leave is chargeable. 44.5.4.  Travel Generated Leaves.  See AFI 65-114, for detailed FSO procedures concerning the  processing  of  travel  generated  leave.    Chapter  4  for  TDY,  Chapter  5  for  PCS,  and Chapter 8 for AF 985 instructions. 44.5.4.1.  All  travel  generated  leave  is  processed  as  a  report,  after  the  fact.    An  AF Form  985  is  prepared  by  the  Travel  Section  in  conjunction  with  the  travel  settlement voucher. 44.5.4.2.  Input a leave report transaction based upon data in the travel voucher using the AF Form985 as the source document. 44.5.5.  Processing by Leave Event, Sequence is: 44.5.5.1.  Request  Approved.    The  base-level  FSO  inputs  a  leave  request  transaction.  The central site system establishes a suspense based on the leave return date. 44.5.5.2.  Member  Departed.  No  input  required  by  base-level  FSO,  however,  if  leave type is P  or  R,  or  if  there  is  excess  leave,  the  DFAS-DE  subsystem  releases  leave  start transaction  to  MMPA.  Leave  type  R  and  excess  leave  establish  a  suspense  for  a  return transaction.  Otherwise, no action. 44.5.5.3.  Leave  extended.    FSO  inputs  correction  transaction.    DFAS-DE  corrects MMPA leave and pay adjustments. 44.5.5.4.  Leave  Corrected.    FSO  inputs  correction  transaction.    DFAS-DE  corrects MMPA leave and pay adjustments caused by improperly recorded leave transaction. 44.5.5.5.  Leave  Canceled.    FSO  inputs  cancellation  transaction.   DFAS-DE  deletes  NB suspense MMPA  entry,  if present,  reverses  MMPA leave and  pay adjustment  caused by recorded start of leave, and closes the erroneous entry. 44.5.5.6.  Member Returns.   FSO takes  no action.    DFAS-DE records leave on MMPA, and starts pay and allowances if member returned from excess leave. 44.5.5.7.  Change to Leave Start Date.  Process as a leave correction. 44.5.5.8.  Leave  Recorded  on  MMPA  Erroneously.    FSO  inputs  correct  or  cancel transactions  as  required.    DFAS-DE  reverses  or  corrects  MMPA  leave  and  pay adjustments caused by the erroneous leave and records the erroneous entry and correction on the MMPA. 44.6.  Special Provisions: 44.6.1.  Supplemental  Procedures  for  Leave  Taken  Within  30  Days  of  Final  Separation  or Retirement. Leave accounting is  critical  when  separation is pending.  Leave  must be  posted promptly  to  the  member's  MMPA  so  that  it  can  be  considered  in  the  mechanized computation of separation pay.   Unless DJMS leave transactions are posted to the MMPA at least  11  days  before  the  separation  date,  the  separation  pay  authorization  issued  by  DJMS will not be correct and the reenlistment and separation area will have to manually compute or AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 739  adjust  the  separation  settlement.    In  any  case,  the  reenlistment  and  separation  area  must verify the MMPA posting of all recent  leaves.  Supplemental procedures are: 44.6.1.1.  When  a  member  requests  leave  with  a  planned  return  date  within  30  days  of separation  or  retirement,  FSO  receives  Part  I  of  AF  Form  988  annotated  "Member Separating  on  (Date)."  Process SB01 according to normal  procedures.    Send a copy  of Part  I  to  the  reenlistment  and  separations  area  for  immediate  filing  in  the  management file. 44.6.1.2.  If  a  correction  is  required  when  the  member  returns,  receive  Part  III  and process  the  applicable  transactions  (SB05,  or  SB06  and  SB03)  as  a  priority  action.  Notify  reenlistment  and  separations  area  of  actual  leave  dates.    Attach  Part  III  to  the DTL. 44.6.2.  Supplemental Procedures  for Terminal Leave (Leave Type P).  Terminal leave  must also  be  posted  to  the  MMPA  at  least  11  days  before  separation  to  be  considered  in  the separation  pay  authorization  issued  by  DJMS.    If  any  leave  other  than  terminal  leave processes after  posting  of a terminal leave suspense, a management notice is  created (under DROT input source ZP) to require the adjustment of the terminal leave, if necessary.  In any event,  the  reenlistment  and  separations  must  verify  MMPA  posting  of  the  terminal  leave. Supplemental procedures are: 44.6.2.1.  Maintain an  AF Form 1486, Unit leave  control log,  when  Part I of  AF  Form 988  is  received  for  terminal  leave  (type  P).    Annotate  the  log  with  the  date,  leave authorization  number  issued,  chargeable  leave  dates  and  the  unit  of  assignment,  as  a minimum.    Additional  information  may  be  entered  in  the  remarks  block,  if  desired.  Process  a  leave  start  (SB01)  transaction.    (See  Figure  44.8)    Attach  Part  I  of  the  AF  Form  988  to  the  Daily  Transaction  Listing  (DTL).    If  separation  date  is  within  2 weeks, notify the reenlistment and separation area. 44.6.2.2.  Part  III  of  AF  Form 988 is received  only if  member is  hospitalized or  returns to duty before  separation.  Input a leave  cancellation (SB06) transaction (Figure 44.11) to  cancel  terminal  leave.    Input  a  leave  report  (SB03)  transaction  (Figure  44.9  and Figure  44.10) for  ordinary leave  (type  A)  for  the  period of  leave actually  used.   Notify the  reenlistment  and  separations  area.  Attach  AF  Form  988  to  Daily  Transmission Listing.  If member desires to revert back to terminal leave, a new AF Form 988 is issued by the unit and it is processed as a new terminal leave with a cross-reference to the initial leave. 44.6.3.  Supplemental Procedures for Emergency Leave: 44.6.3.1.  Supplemental  procedures  for  emergency  with  travel  at  government  expense using AF Form 972 are in AFI 65-114. 44.6.3.2.  If the member is on ordinary leave, the leave converts to emergency leave only if  the  situation  cannot  be  resolved  during  the  balance  of  the  ordinary  leave  period.    If converted,  the  FSO  receives  Part  III  from  the  leave  approving  authority  and  inputs  a leave correction (SB05) transaction.   (See Figure 44.9)  The date stop is the day before the date  the  commander authorized  the  conversion  to  emergency  leave.   A  new  Part  I 740 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 is  issued  by  the  commander  for  the  emergency leave.   If  converted, the  member is  not authorized government funded travel to return to the duty station. 44.6.4.  Supplemental Procedures for Appellate Review Leave, Type R: 44.6.4.1.  Appellate  review  leave  (type  R)  is  taken  when  a  member  has  been           court-martialed  and  sentenced  to  an  unsuspended  dismissal,  dishonorable  discharge,  or bad  conduct  discharge.    These  sentences  require  a  review  by  the  Court  of  Military Review.  Members are required to take leave pending completion of the appellate review process.   This leave  is referred  to  as  appellate  review  leave and  should be processed as follows: 44.6.4.1.1.  The  FSO  assigns  the  leave  authorization  number  for  appellate  review leaves and records those leaves on an FSO maintained AF Form 1486.  The FSO does not  have to receive an  AF  Form  988  to  assign  a  leave  authorization  number.  Leave authorization  numbers  are  not  issued  more  than  30  days  before  the  leave  effective date. 44.6.4.1.2.  The leave start (SB01) transaction automatically stops all allotments with the prior month effective date and generates a permanent pay suppression.  The leave start  transaction  will  process  with  up  to  300  days  of  leave  granted.    The  start transaction places the member in a suspended (T-status type 9 Chapter 52) status. 44.6.4.1.3.  A  U503  management  notice  is  issued,  during  month-end  restructure, approximately 30 days prior to the leave expiration date.  The FSO verifies with the legal office that the member is still on appellate review leave.  If so and the 300 days of granted leave has or is about to expire, process a leave stop (SB02) transaction and a new leave start (SB01) transaction. 44.6.4.1.4.  A  member  directed  to take  appellate  review  leave  on  or  after  19  January  1982,  may  either  receive  a  lump  sum  payment  for  any  accrued  leave balance,  and  remain  in  an  unpaid  excess leave status until the end of the review, or may  receive  normal  pay  and  allowances  until  the  accrued  leave  is  used  and  then continue in an unpaid excess leave status until the review is completed. 44.6.4.1.5.  If  the  member  requests  a  lump-sum  payment  for  the  accrued  leave, process  the  start  leave  transaction  (SB01)  and  the  payment  (PK03)  transaction immediately to  prevent overpayment to the member.  When calculating the payment amount,  make  sure  all  debts  have  been  deducted  to  the  extent  available  from  the accrued  leave  settlement.    Court  martial  forfeitures  will  accrue  through  the  date before  the  start  of  appellate  leave.    Send  a  message  to  DFAS-DE/FJP  in  the following format within 3 days of the payment: SUBJECT:    Payment  of  Appellate  Leave (days paid). - Member's name - Member's SSAN - Effective date of leave - Number of days granted      AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 741     - Leave authorization number - Amount of payment, date of payment, ADSN, and voucher number - Future mailing address (street, city, state and ZIP code) - Name and telephone of FSO's contact point 44.6.4.1.6.  If  the  member  requests  normal  pay  and  allowances  during  the  period  of accrued leave, and then continues on unpaid excess leave, do the following to prevent overpayment to the member: 44.6.4.1.6.1.  If  the  member  is  a  central  payee,  input  a  permanent  suppression (LH02)  transaction  (Chapter  38).  If  the  member  is  a  local  payee,  permanently suppress the pay by placing the person in a suspended (ST) status (Chapter 81). 44.6.4.1.6.2.  Administratively stop all allotments (Chapter 57). 44.6.4.1.6.3.  Process the leave start (SB01) transaction. 44.6.4.1.6.4.  Manually,  prepare  payments  for  these  individuals  on  paydays  or the  appropriate  date  payment  due.  Example:  An  individual  directed  to  go  on appellate review leave has an accrued leave balance of 20 days.  The member is in confinement and receiving no pay and is released from confinement 5 Mar 1992.  The  member  is  paid  for  11  days  on  15  Mar  1992  for  the  period  5  Mar  1992 through  15  Mar  1992,  and  another  payment  for  9  days  on  24  Mar  1983  for  the period  16  Mar  1992  through  24  Mar  1992.    These  amounts  accrue  manually computed just as you would for an accession.  This example is for an individual previously  in a  non-pay  status.  If this  member  was  previously in a pay  status, a payment is  made on 15 Mar 1992 less all appropriate deductions and collections and  9  days  on  24  Mar  1992  for  the  period  16  Mar  1992  through  24  Mar  1992. NOTE:  Include any  leave accrual  when  computing  the  number  of  days  to  pay a  member  electing  to receive  pay  and allowances  during the  period  of  accrued leave.    Members  directed  to  go  on  appellate  review  leave  do  not  accrue  leave while using accrued leave, and do not accrue leave while on excess leave. 44.6.4.1.6.5.  Prepare  a  management  case  file  for  each  member  on  appellate review leave serviced by your ADSN.   Keep in close contact with the MPF, unit, and  Judge  Advocate Office  to  keep  current  on  the  member's  status.   Documents maintained  in  these  files  are:  Court-Martial  orders,  AF  Form  2098,  duty  status changes (if available),  paperwork  directing  payment  or  leave  settlement  option, and  copies  of  initial  and  subsequent  AF  Forms  988.  FSO’s  use  Sysout Archive  and  Retrieval  (SAR)  software  to  retrieve  report  FA0940MJEA (mode  JFAREG).    This  listing  includes  individuals  on  appellate  review  leave and  is  used  to  verify  that  a  Case  Management  System  (CMS)  case  has  been established  or  to  establish  one  if  not  already  done.    A  listing  received  from DFAS-DE showing individuals on appellate review leave assigned to your ADSN should  be used to  verify  that a  management  case  file  has  been  established  or  to establish  one  if  not  already  done.    This  listing  may  also  be  used  to  aid  in monitoring  expired  leaves  which  require  renewal.  NOTE:  If  the  member  was required  to  take  appellate  leave  under  Article  76A,  UCMJ,  and  the  sentence  by 742 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 court-martial  to  dismissal  or  dishonorable  or  bad  conduct  discharge  is  set  aside or  disapproved,  then  leave  accrues,  and  pay  and  allowances  for  the  period  of leave charged as excess leave must be paid.  The amount  of pay and allowances accrued under DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1, paragraph 0103, shall be reduced by  the  total  amount  of  income  from  wages,  salaries,  tips,  other  personal  service income,  unemployment  compensation,  and  public  assistance  benefits  from  any government agency during the period the member is deemed to have accrued pay and allowances.  If no statement of earnings is available at the time DFAS-DE is computing the amount of pay the member is due, a letter will be forwarded to the member by DFAS-JMCBD/DE. 44.6.5.  Procedures for Air Force Educational Leave of Absence Program: 44.6.5.1.  Entitlement:  A member in this educational leave status (AFLEA) is entitled to basic  pay  only.    Member  is  not  entitled  to  receive  BAH,  BAS,  or  any  other  pay  and allowance  to  which member  might otherwise be  entitled  for  period of leave of absence. (reference DoDFMR Volume 7A, Table 1-11). 44.6.5.2.  Processing:  Code the AF Form 988 as a type 1 (educational leave of absence). Since  the  existing  type  1  does  not  adjust  any  entitlements,  the  FSO  is  required  to complete DD  Form 114 (military pay order) to stop all entitlements except basic pay for the period of the leave. 44.6.6.  Procedures for Adoption Leave: 44.6.6.1.  Members adopting a qualifying child are entitled to take non-chargeable leave for up to 21 days in a calendar year to be used in connection with the adoption. 44.6.6.1.1.  Adoption leave may be used in conjunction with ordinary leave. 44.6.6.1.2.  Use “permissive temporary duty (PTDY)” to designate adoption leave. 44.6.6.1.3.  Members  submit  the  request  for  adoption  leave  using  AF  Form  988 indicating PTDY and including the statement:  “Adoption leave per AFI 36-3003”. 44.6.6.1.4.  Members  who  used  ordinary  leave,  on  or  after  1  Jan  06,  for  adoption purposes must work with the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS) to correct the leave. 44.6.6.2.  Only  one  member  of  a  member-to-member  couple  is  authorized  to  take  this adoption leave.  Monitor the situation to ensure this is the case. 44.6.6.3.  Monitor  the  adoption  leave  to  ensure  that  no  more  than  21  days  is  used  in  a calendar year. 44.6.7.  Paternity  Leave.    Effective  14  Oct  08,  the  law  authorizes  up  to  10  days  of  non-chargeable paternity leave for a married member, on active duty, whose wife gives birth to a child.  The child must be born on or after 14 Oct 08. 44.6.7.1.  The leave must be taken over consecutive days and as soon as possible, but not later  than  1  year  following  the  birth  of  the  child.    Any  exceptions  to  policy  must  be submitted to the  wing  commander  or  equivalent (not  to be  delegated  below  the  level  of group commander) for review and approval. 44.6.7.2.  Paternity leave may be authorized in conjunction with ordinary leave. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 743  44.6.7.3.  Members  submit  the  paternity  leave    request  on  an  AF  IMT  988  Leave Request/Authorization,  indicating  PTDY  and  including  the  statement  “Paternity  Leave per PSDM 08-63.” 44.7.  Leave Accrual, etc., for Members Assigned to Hostile Fire Areas: 44.7.1.  Members  assigned  to  hostile  fire  areas  for  four  or  more  consecutive  months,  or have  been approved  for  special  leave  accrual  through  personnel  channels  as  set  forth  in AFI 36-3003, are allowed to carry forward more than 60 days of leave from one fiscal year to the next. 44.7.2.  This  is  done  for  three  full  fiscal  years  after  departure  from  the  combat  zone  but  is subject to the following limitations: 44.7.2.1.  Member can accrue up to 120 days leave in accordance with AFI 36-3003.  After departing the combat zone the limit is the balance as of departure from the combat zone.  (Data  element  CZ-CON  from  the  BS  entry,  or  the  current  month  balance  from  the  BR entry.) 44.7.2.2.  Whenever  a  member  takes  leave,  the  balance  as  of  the  end  of  the  leave  is compared to the balance as of departure.  If the balance as of the end of the leave is less than the balance as of departure, the balance as of the end of the leave becomes the new maximum.  (See Figure 44.5) 44.8.  Input: 44.8.1.  Format  IDs  and  Action  Codes  For  Leave  Transactions.   Transactions  are  identified by  format ID and action code.  The letters SB designate a leave transaction and the numbers designate the action. 44.8.2.  When starting a leave, use the format ID and action code SB01.  (See Figure 44.8) 44.8.3.  When stopping a leave, use the format ID and action code SB02.  (See Figure 44.9 and  Figure  44.10)  Use  a  leave  stop  transaction  only  if  the  number  of  days  taken  was different than the number of days input in the SB01. 44.8.4.  When reporting a leave, use the format ID and action code SB03.  (See Figure 44.9 and Figure 44.10)   Use a leave report  transaction if the leave  start  was  never input and  the leave has been completed. 44.8.5.  When correcting a leave, use the format ID and action code SB05.  (See Figure 44.9) When a leave is corrected, the system updates the NB suspense entry and the transaction on recycle,  or  the  system  generates  a  SB06  to  cancel  the  original  and  a  SB03  to  report  the correct leave. 44.8.6.  When  canceling  a  leave,  use  the  format  ID  and  action  code  SB06  (Figure  44.11).  When  a leave is  canceled, the  system  deletes the NB  suspense  entry and  the transaction  on recycle  or  sends  the  transaction  to  the  MMPA  if  the  leave  was  already  reported  to  the MMPA.    DJMS  MMPA.    DJMS  reverses  any  MMPA  adjustments  caused  by  the  original leave. 44.8.7.  The  leave  transaction  shows  the  completed  period  of  leave,  or  the  open  period  of leave  if  the  leave  is  excess,  terminal,  or  appellate  review.    The  status  of  the  leave  entry 744 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 can  be  determined  by  checking the ENTRY-OPEN-CLOSD indicator in the SB  entry.   The following codes are used:     1-- Departed on leave.  (Indicates an open leave entry.) 2-- Extended leave period one. 3-- Extended leave period twice. 4-- Extended leave period three times. A-- Leave period closed without an extension.  B-- Leave period extended once and closed. C-- Leave period extended twice and closed. D-- Leave period extended three times and closed. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 745   44.8.8.  Leave Types. (Not travel-related.)

Graduation leave may be recorded on AF Form 985. 44.9.  LeaveWeb.  LeaveWeb  (LW)  is  an  air  force  system  that  automates  the  method  of requesting  and  processing  leave  (in  lieu  of  using  the  hard  copy  AF  Form  988).    Under LeaveWeb  the  member  requests  leave  which  generates  an  email  to  his  or  her  supervisor.  The supervisor approves or disapproves the leave and if approved, sends the leave information to the unit  leave  clerk  to  validate.    Once  validated  the  leave  is  sent  electronically  to  finance.    The following subparagraphs provide detailed information on various LeaveWeb processes. 746 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 44.9.1.  Documentation/FSO Daily Responsibilities: 44.9.1.1.  Transactions  input  by  other  than  the  requesting  individual  must  be  supported with  a  hard  copy  AF  IMT  988  (provided  by  the  unit)  and  signed  by  the  member requesting  the  leave.    These  transactions  may  include  permissive  TDY,  terminal  leave, etc. 44.9.1.2.  Download the daily register of transactions from DFAS on a daily basis. 44.9.1.2.1.  (DELETED) 44.9.1.2.2.  (DELETED) 44.9.1.3.  This must be accomplished whether or not daily LW cycles were transmitted to DFAS. 44.9.1.3.1.  (DELETED) 44.9.1.3.2.  (DELETED) 44.9.1.3.2.1.  (DELETED) 44.9.1.4.  Rejected leave transactions must be researched, corrected and input into DJMS manually; re-processed leave transactions must be manually reconciled in LW after they are posted to DJMS. 44.9.1.4.1.  (DELETED) 44.9.2.  FSO weekly processes: 44.9.2.1.  Review un-reconciled transactions: 44.9.2.1.1.  To determine the number of un-reconciled transactions in LW: 44.9.2.1.1.1.  Go to site statistics under “system admin”.  Review the total leaves, and the number un-reconciled. 44.9.2.1.1.1.1.  with the  exception of the  period  from EOM cutoff to the  first update of the following month only one-two days of leave transactions should be in this status. 44.9.2.1.1.2.  to query un-reconciled leaves in the system: 44.9.2.1.1.2.1.  go  to  “leave  query  history”,  change  the  time  period  to  an extended period  of  time  (ex.  Jan  2002  -  current  day),  select  “un-reconciled leaves” and  then “query”. 44.9.2.1.2.  once the un-reconciled transactions are identified: 44.9.2.1.2.1.  contact the unit administrator for any leaves in r0, r1 or r2 status and require appropriate action be taken. 44.9.2.1.2.2.  review  the  details  for  each  leave  in  r3  status.    Determine  why  the transaction did not reconcile. 44.9.2.1.2.2.1.  verify  if  the  return  from  leave  was  no  change,  a  change  in the leave days, or the leave was canceled. 44.9.2.1.2.3.  compare  the  transaction  in  LW  to  the  leave  transaction  in  DJMS AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 747  and if the transaction processed correctly note the processing cycle in the remarks block  in  LW,  then  click  “reconcile”  at  the  bottom  of  the  screen  and  then  click “run query” at the top of the transaction and move to the next transaction. 44.9.2.1.2.3.1.  if  the  transaction  has  not  processed  in  DJMS  determine  the cause  and  if  appropriate  prepare  a  DD-114  as  the  source  document  and manually process the transaction. 44.9.2.1.2.3.1.1.  once this transaction posts in DJMS manually reconcile the transaction in LW (if necessary). 44.9.3.  FSO monthly processes: 44.9.3.1.  Pull the latest LBL when available using “offline” and upload it into LW. 44.9.3.1.1.  Notify  all  orderly  rooms  via  e-mail  or  the  LW  messaging  system  to identify any necessary changes to personnel assigned to their unit. 44.9.3.1.2.  Review  all  accounts  assigned  to  the  @@  (undetermined)  unit  of assignment.  Work  with  MPF,  units,  and  processing  teams  to  have  these  accounts assigned to the correct unit. 44.9.3.1.2.1.  Process sc04 and/or have units process LG04 transactions to assign personnel to their appropriate unit in DJMS, JLEF and LW. 44.9.4.  Quality Examinations (GE) and LeaveWeb:  the procedures outlined in 44.9.2.1 must be followed in order to have an effective leave program.  However, checks and balances are used  to  assure  adherence  to  procedures  and  to  the  integrity  of  the  LW  system.    These checks and balances are the responsibility of quality examinations area. 44.9.4.1.  Metrics:  the primary monitoring metric is the number of un-reconciled leaves in  LW.  The  system  pulls  this  metric  each  night  and  can  be  viewed  by  clicking  on           “site  statistics”  under  the  system  administrator  tab  in  LW.    Focus  on  the  number  of        un-reconciled  transactions  instead  of  the  percentage  of  total  transactions.    With  the exception of the period from EOM cutoff to the first update of the following month only one-two days of leave transactions should be in the un-reconciled status.   As a minimum the  LW  finance  administrator  should  review  this  weekly  and  follow  the  instructions  in 44.9.2.1 to reconcile aged transactions. 44.9.5.  Reports:    LW  has  the  following  reports  that  can  be  used  by  either  the  LW administrator  or  by  GE  to  monitor  the  use  of  the  system  and  to  ensure  controls  are  being followed: 44.9.5.1.  Daily  Transaction  Processing  Report, JDC  Log,  and  DROT  Log  (general  reporting):    as  outlined  in  44.9.2.1,  these  reports  should  be  used  to  ensure  all JDC files are transmitted to DFAS and that corresponding DROTS are uploaded into LW daily.  By reviewing the “run date” for each JDC cycle and checking which DROTS have been imported it is  possible to  determine  whether  or  not the  system is being  maintained on a daily basis. 44.9.5.2.  Manual  Reconciliation  Report  (general  reporting):    this  report  lists  the transactions that were reconciled using interfaces from DFAS or manually reconciled.  By 748 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 reviewing  a  sampling  of  this  report  it  is  possible  to  determine  if  leaves  were  posted against DJMS as required or if the integrity of the system is being breached. 44.9.5.3.  Successive Leaves (general reporting):   While leave is a commanders program and  FM  is  not  responsible  to  “police”  leaves,  LW  provides  a  tool  to  identify  potential inappropriate  use  of  the  leave  entitlement.  The  report  for  successive  leaves  identifies leave transactions  which are  separated  by  only  one  to  two  days  and  appear  to  bridge  a time off such as successive Monday-Friday leaves.  The recommended use of this report is to periodically pull this report and forward it to the unit commanders.  The commander can then determine the appropriateness of these transactions and take appropriate action. 44.9.5.4.  Leave  Balance  Listing:    QA  should  review  that  portion  of  the  LBL  for individuals assigned to the @@ unit of assignment.   Personnel assigned to this unit are not  properly  assigned  to  an  organization  on  the  LBL  that  was  imported  from  DJMS.  These individuals are not able to use LW for leave processing and should be assigned to their correct units of assignment by either processing an SC04 or by the units processing an LG04 via the personnel system.  For bases using LeaveWeb, upload the leave balance listing and notify the orderly room of this action. 44.9.6.  Other  Uses  of  LW:  LeaveWeb  is  a  leave  tracking,  reporting  and  reconciliation system.  However, LW can also be used as a tool to help in other areas as well. 44.9.6.1.  Separations:    Via  LW,  the  separations  clerk  can  request  a  list  of  all  leave taken  by  an  individual  during  a  period  of  time.    This  can  be  used  to  identify  any leaves requested and  not charged in DJMS as well as to validate the final leave balance at separation. 44.9.6.2.  Management  Tool:  LW  can  be  used  to  identify  leave  taken  by  an  individual who is  subject to  PRA audit.   By  querying an  individual’s record a  complete  history  of leaves requested by individual or unit can be generated for review. 44.9.6.3.  Leave Recall Roster:  LW  can  be used to  identify those  members  currently  on leave and  provide  necessary information to  contact these individuals and recall them to duty.    The  unit  has  the  capacity  under  LW  to  pull  this  information  for  personnel assigned to their unit.   Finance can pull this information for the entire installation.  This information  is  only  as  good  as  the  information  input  by  the  member  when  requesting leave. 44.9.7.  Figure  44.12  through Figure  44.24  provide  detailed  guidance  on  the utilization  of the LW system: 44.9.7.1.  Figure 44.12:  Leave Approving Official Instructions. 44.9.7.2.

GENERAL SUMMARY OF LEAVE BALANCE ENTRY  FORMAT ID BR 1. The open BR leave balance entry shows the member's leave balance to date for the current fiscal year (FY).  This entry is updated by month-end restructure to show leave accrual through the end of the next month and is updated as leave transactions are processed.  The open BR entry is moved to history and a new open BR entry is created by FY end processing and reenlistment processing.  This entry is also closed and moved to history by final separation processing.  2. The BR leave balance entry is made up of the following data items:  a. CZ-BAL-INDCTR (combat zone balance indicator):   1 = member not in a combat zone.  2 = member is a combat zone. b. BF-PRIOR-FY  (balance  forwarded  prior  fiscal  year)  shows  leave  balance  brought forward from a prior FY or prior enlistment.  ERND-FY (earned current fiscal year) shows the leave earned during the current FY. c. Month-end restructure adds an accrual  of 2.5  days  of leave to  this item  each  month.   If the member separates, the computer will prorate the accrual for the month of separation from the first of the month to the date of separation.  If the member enters a status that prohibits accrual of leave, status processing automatically adjusts accrual.  d. USED-FY (used current fiscal year) shows all earned and advanced leave days taken and  charged  against  the  members  leave  account  during  the  current  FY.  Excess  leave  is  not included in this total.  e. current month.  This item is the total of BF-PRIOR-FY plus ERND-FY minus USED-FY.  f. NOT-ACRD-FY (not accrued current fiscal year) shows the number of days leave not accrued  because  the  member  was  in  a  status  (AWOL,  confinement,  excess  leave,  etc.)  that does  not  allow  accrual  of  leave.  The  non-accrual  is  prorated  on  the  same  basis  a  leave  is accrued and is automatically computed based on processing of the status transaction.  g. the current FY that the member was in a status, other than excess leave, that did not allow for the accrual of leave. BAL-CM (balance current month) reflects the leave balance as of the end of the LOST-DAYS-CFY (lost days current fiscal year) shows the number of days for   h. FY that the member was charged excess leave. XCS-FY (excess current fiscal year) shows the number of days during the current LOST shows the number of days of leave that the member lost at the end of the i. FY.  FY year-end processing reduces the current month leave balance over 60 days to 60 and shows the days over 60 as lost.  Leave transactions applicable to the previous FY but 758  processed after the close of the FY are posted against any days lost until that balance is reduced to zero, then against the current month balance. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 SETLMNT (settlement) shows what election the member made for sale of leave j. upon separation/reenlistment, or first extension.  Codes are as follow:  1 = Sold all leave.  2 = Carried leave forward.  3 = Carried leave forward to another branch of service.  4 = Excess leave collection at time of separation.  5 = Unsettled leave balance-character of discharge not determined.  6 = Settlement unauthorized-member separated under conditions precluding payment.  7 = Split leave-member carried some leave forward and sold remainder but less than 60 days.  8 = Sold 60 days.  9 = Member accessed-prior leave settlement is in doubt.   AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 759  Figure 44.5.

When a  member  serves 120 or  more  consecutive days in a  combat zone (or  has been approved for  special leave accrual  through personnel  channels, as  set  forth in  AFI 36-3003), the member is allowed to carry forward more than 60 days leave from one fiscal year (FY) to the next.  This can be done for three full fiscal years after departure from the combat zone but is subject to the following limitations: a.  Unless the member is missing in action, the number of days that a member can carry over at the end of the fiscal year is 120. b.   After departing the combat zone, the limit is the balance as of the date of departure from the combat zone, or the current month leave balance, whichever is less.  Whenever a member takes leave, the balance as of the end of the leave is compared to the balance as of departure.  If the balance as of the end of the leave is less than the balance as of departure, the balance as of the end of the leave becomes the new maximum. 2. Application of the BS entry is as follows: a.   When the member arrives in the combat zone, a BS01 or 2301 entry is input: (1)  If an open BS entry is present, and no departure is indicated in the open BS entry, the transaction is rejected.  (The prior period in the combat zone must be resolved.) (2)   An open BS entry is established.  The arrival date is set, the departure date is zero filled, and the CZ-CON (running balance for combat zone) is set to match the open BR leave balance. b.   When the member departs the combat zone, either a BS02 or 2302 entry is input: (1)  The departure date is set in the BS entry and the leave balance as of departure is set in the CZ-CON. 760 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 than four months, the BS entry is closed.  (The period is not long enough to qualify.) (a)  If the period between the arrival and departure date (inclusive) is less                60.5 days, the BS entry is closed (no extra leave to be saved). (b)   If the member's leave balance as of the departure date is less than (c)  If neither of the above applies, the BS entry remains open.  A future date is set to close the BS entry at the end of the third full fiscal year after the departure date.  (This is the FY-EXPRTN-DATE in the BS entry.) c.   Processing of leave (SB02 or SB03): (1)   If the departure date in the BS entry is zero, the CZ-CON is set to match the current leave balance. (2)   If the departure date in the BS entry is present, the balance as of the last day of leave is compared to the CZ-CON in the BS entry: (a)  If the balance as of the end of the leave is greater than or equal to the CZ-CON, nothing happens.  (b)  If the balance as of the end of the leave is less than the CZ-CON, the CZ-CON is reduced to the balance as of the end of the leave.  This becomes the new maximum carryover.  If the new CZ-CON is less than 60.5 days, the BS entry is closed since the member is deemed to have used the extra leave accrued in the combat zone.            1. 3. 4. 5. 6.

The  DTS  Administrator  (DTA)  provides  a  copy  of  the Military  Leave  Report,  from  DTS,  to  customer  service/customer  support  every  day.    Upon receipt of the report, validate the days identified as leave in DTS were charged to the member's MMPA. 44.10.1.  If  the  days  were  not  charged,  go  into  Leave  Web,  get  a  leave  number  using  the input source code identified for DTS, and use LeaveWeb to charge the leave. 44.10.2.  Annotate the report with the leave number and dates charged, whether the leave has already been charged or you are updating through LeaveWeb. 44.10.3.  If the dates of leave on the MMPA do not match what is on the report, validate that leave  was  taken  and  the  correct  period,  with  the  member's  supervisor,  make  all  necessary corrections, and annotate the report accordingly. 44.10.4.  If the  leave  cannot  be  charged via LeaveWeb  and the  base  has already  cutover to the AFFSC, the DTS report is scanned and send to the AFFSC for posting the leave.  If the base has not cutover to the AFFSC, the finance office posts the leave via DMO. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 783  Chapter 45 RESERVED FOR FUTURE USE 784 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 46 ABSENT WITHOUT LEAVE (AWOL) 46.1.  Description.  The  Definitions  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  defines  Absent  Without Leave (AWOL) as absence from a place of duty without permission or authorization and without the intention of deserting. 46.2.  Substantiating  Documents.  The  MPF  is  responsible  for  furnishing  the  FSO  a  copy  of AF Form 2098, Duty Status Change, or the JUMPS transaction register on a daily basis. 46.3.  Responsibilities.  The  orderly  room  (squadron  commander  or  first  sergeant)  advises  the FSO,  by  telephone,  of  any  member  declared  AWOL.  Based  on  this  information,  the  FSO processes a P103 or P203 to prevent issuance of a paycheck. 46.4.  FSO Actions: 46.4.1.  Upon receipt of substantiating documents mentioned in paragraph 46.2, suspend all payments to the member reported AWOL.  Review the member's MMPA daily to ensure the member  is  placed  in  an  AWOL  status  (SJ)  but  do  not  process  an  ST04,  as  this  will  cause MPF transactions to reject. 46.4.2.  Absentee From Unit Transferred Overseas.  If member is AWOL when his or her unit departs, FSO sends management file to DFAS-DE via AF Form 1209, Document Transmittal (JUMPS).  Mark  envelope,  address  label,  and  AF  Form  1209  with  red  pencil  to  show member's status.  (See Chapter 2.) 46.4.3.  Disposition of Absentee's Management File: 46.4.3.1.  Absentee From Unit Transferred Overseas.  See 46.4.2 above. 46.4.3.2.  All  Other  Absentees.  Dispose  of  management  file  per  paragraph  47.3.  If member's  unit  is  transferred,  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  (other  than  overseas), send absentee's  management  file  to  new  station  with  management  file  of the unit.  New station complies with paragraph 47.3. 46.5.  Effect on MMPA: 46.5.1.  Pay and Allowances.  AWOL status automatically suspends all pay and allowances. 46.5.2.  Allotments.  When an SJ04 transaction processes, DJMS stops allotments as follows: 46.5.2.1.  At  the  end  of  the  previous  month,  if  member  does  not  have  sufficient  pay accrued  to  cover  allotments.  NOTE:  If  AWOL  occurs  during  the  beginning  of  the month,  this  will  almost  always  result  in  allotments  being  stopped  immediately  on processing of the SJ04 transaction. 46.5.2.2.  At  the  end  of  the  month,  AWOL  starts  if  sufficient  pay  is  accrued  to  cover the allotments. 46.5.2.3.  Allotments for bonds are stopped as of last bond issue date. 46.5.2.4.  DJMS sends the servicing ADSN an XJ management notice to inform the FSO the date allotments stopped. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 785  46.5.3.  Leave  Accounting.    AWOL  status  automatically  suspends  leave  accruals  until member  is returned to a leave-earning status. 46.5.4.  Lost Time.  When  the  AWOL  status is terminated, DJMS automatically adjusts  pay date  and  total  active  federal  military  service  date  (TAFMSD).  MPF  input  is  required  to change DOS, if necessary. 46.5.5.  Servicemen’s  Group  Life  Insurance  (SGLI).    DJMS  stops  this  deduction  at  end  of month  in  which  the  31st  day  of  AWOL  status  occurs.    When  an  AWOL  period  ends, SGLI, if previously in effect, is automatically reinstated. 46.5.6.  AFRH  Deduction.  DJMS  deducts  for  month  AWOL  status  started.  However,  if AWOL began on first day of a month, deduction is stopped at end of prior month. 46.6.  Special  Provisions.  If  member  fails  to  report  to  new  duty  station  and  later  arrives, these actions apply: 46.6.1.  Gaining unit or any military installation  must inform losing unit  of  member's  status or  failure to report under PCS orders.  (See AFI 36-2911, section D, paragraph 11.)  Contact DFAS-DE for identity of losing unit, if necessary. 46.6.2.  Based  on  AF  Form  2098,  Duty  Status  Change,  prepared  by  losing  unit,  MPF inputs SJ04 transaction to change status to AWOL.  Normal AWOL processing follows. 46.6.3.  If  member  later  reports  to  new  station,  gaining  MPF  inputs  SA04  transaction  to remove AWOL status.  FSO then processes an SG03 transaction.  The on-station transaction reinstates the SH PCS status on the MMPA.  On-station processing follows under Table 43.2, rule 1. 46.6.4.  SJ03  transactions  to  report  periods  of  AWOL,  which  occurred  while  member  was in a PCS status, do not process until an SG03 is processed.  (See paragraph 41.3) 46.7.  Input: 46.7.1.  Action  Indicators.    Use  and  effect  of  specific  action  indicators  prescribed  for AWOL are in Table 46.1. 46.7.2.  Data Elements and Codes: 46.7.2.1.  Starting AWOL.  Status determinant code J denotes member is on unauthorized absence of more than 24 hours. 46.7.2.2.  Terminating  AWOL.    The  member's  MPF  will  use  status  determinant applicable  to  member's  current  status  (A  --  on-station;  K  --  confinement).    See    Chapter 43 for action to obtain member's management file from DFAS-DE, if necessary. 46.7.3.  Excused  Absence.    If  an  AWOL  absence  was  reported  to  DFAS-DE  and  later excused as unavoidable: 46.7.3.1.  The MPF  submits a transaction containing the  start date of the bad  status and number of days to make good equals zero.  This transaction causes DFAS-DE to cancel the period of AWOL. 786 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 46.7.3.2.  If  absence  is  chargeable  to  leave,  unit  prepares  report  transaction  under the  leave  accounting  procedures  to  charge  absence  to  leave.    (See  Chapter  44  and     AFI 36-2911, paragraph 18.) AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 787  Figure 46.1.

Deserter status is declared after a member has been AWOL for 30 days.  (For information on AWOL.  See Chapter 46 of this volume.)  Member's MPF reports deserter status to DJMS. 47.2.  Substantiating  Document.  The  MPF  furnishes  the  FSO  a  copy  of  AF  Form  2098, Duty Status Change (Figure 47.1), and the JTR on a daily basis. 47.3.  Responsibilities.  Upon receipt of the substantiating documents, the FSO should suspend all  payments  to  the  member  reported  AWOL  by  processing  a  P103  or  P203,  and  review  the MMPA  daily  until  the  SP04  processes.    Do  not  process  an  ST04  as  this  will  cause  the  MPF transactions to reject. 47.4.  FSO Actions: 47.4.1.  Dropped  from  Rolls  of  Unit.  On  180th  day  of  absence  status,  unit  issues  an  AF Form 2098 showing status change from deserter to dropped from rolls (DFR). FSO then mails AF  Form  2098  and  management  file  (if  applicable)  with  AF  Form  1209,  Documental Transmittal (DJMS), to DFAS-DE.  Mark  AF Form 1209 with  red  pencil  to  show  member's status. (See Chapter 3.) Submit these documents and information, as applicable. 47.4.1.1.  Copy of CTHR print, with unsettled advances highlighted. 47.4.1.2.  Copy of DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data. 47.4.1.3.  Unpaid  travel  claims  (DD  Form  1351-2,  Travel  Voucher  or  Sub-voucher), showing itinerary with applicable orders. 47.4.1.4.  Report of any unusual circumstances affecting the pay account. 47.4.2.  Return from Deserter Status.  When notification is received that member has returned to  military  control,  DFAS-DE  sends  management  file  to  proper  FSO.  See  paragraph  43.6 Include pertinent documents listed above. 47.5.  Effect of Desertion Status on MMPA: 47.5.1.  Pay  and  Allowances.  Desertion  status  automatically  stops  all  accruals  of  pay  and allowances. Any  credits in the pay account are used to  satisfy debts to the  United States, as required.  Otherwise, they are held until member's return to military control. 47.5.2.  Allotments.    Any  allotments  in  effect  are  stopped  at  end  of  month  before desertion  status began.  However, if processing date is after restructure, they are stopped at end of current month.  To restart allotments, submit input IAW Chapter 57 and Chapter 58. 47.5.3.  Deduction for SGLI.   DFAS-DE stops deduction at end of month in which the 31st day of absentee's status occurs.  When a desertion status is terminated, SGLI, if previously in effect, is automatically reinstated. 47.5.4.  AFRH  Deduction.  DFAS-DE  deducts  for  month  AWOL or  desertion  status  started. However, if absence began on first day of a month, deduction is stopped end of prior month. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 791  47.5.5.  Leave  Accounting.    Desertion  status  automatically  stops  leave  accruals  until member is returned to a leave-earning status. 47.5.6.  Lost Time.   DFAS-DE automatically adjusts pay  date and Total  Air Force  Military Service  Date  (TAFMSD).    MPF  input  of  a  TI  transaction  is  required  to  change  date  of separation (DOS) and expiration of term of service (ETS). 47.5.7.  Other Entitlements.  Submit other entitlement items determined due as separate input transactions.    Ensure  that  start  date  is  after  desertion  status  ends  and  that  MMPA  has  been reestablished. 47.6.  Special Provisions: 47.6.1.  Action  Indicators.    Specific  action  indicators  to  input  desertion  status  are  in       Table 47.1. 47.6.2.  Data  Elements  and  Codes.  See  Attachment  13.  When  beginning  desertion,  status determinant code P denotes member administratively classified as a deserter. 47.6.3.  Excused  Absence.  If  member's  command  excuses  the  absence  as  unavoidable,         AF Form 2098 is sent to FSO. 47.6.3.1.  Absence  Excused.    See  paragraph  46.4.3.1  for  action  to  be  taken  when absence is excused. 47.6.3.2.  Absence  Chargeable  to  Leave.    If  absence  is  chargeable  to  leave,  unit prepares  a  report-type  transaction  under  the  leave  accounting  procedures  to  charge absence to leave.

The  effects  of  specific  types  of  confinement  on  a  member's  pay  and allowances are described in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 1. 48.2.  Substantiating Document.  The MPF furnishes the FSO a copy of the DJMS JTR. 48.3.  Responsibilities.  The  orderly  room  (squadron  commander  or  first  sergeant)  advises  the FSO,  by  telephone,  of any  member  placed in civilian  confinement.  Based on this information, the  FSO  takes  steps  to  prevent  a  paycheck  from  being  issued,  including  suppressing  the member's pay  for local payees (P103 for  mid-month/P203  for  end  of  month).    Member's  MPF inputs the transaction to report member's confinement, civilian or military (SK transaction). 48.4.  FSO Actions: 48.4.1.  Do not process ST04. 48.4.2.  Based upon receipt  of  substantiating documents, immediately  suspend all  payments to member reported confined, if confinement is a type that suspends member's entitlement to pay and allowances.  (See Table 48.4)  FSO reviews the member's MMPA daily to ensure the confinement status is posted. 48.4.3.  Disposition of Management Files for Confined Members.  (See Chapter 2.) 48.4.3.1.  Civil Confinement.  Maintain management file at base level while member is in pre-trial  confinement.    If  member  is  confined  after  conviction,  mail  management  case file  to  DFAS-DE  after  180  days  (see  Chapter  2)  with  AF  Form  1209,  Document Transmittal (DJMS).  To obtain the management file from DFAS-DE on member's release, see paragraph 43.6. 48.4.3.2.  Military Confinement.  Maintain per Chapter 2. 48.5.  Effect  of  Confinement  Status  on  MMPA.  (See  Table  48.1)    When  member's  pay  is suspended, allotments are handled the same as for AWOL.  (See paragraph 46.5.2) 48.6.  Special Provisions: 48.6.1.  Lost Time. When the confinement status is terminated by MPF, DJMS automatically adjusts pay date and TAFMSD. If DOS/ETS is to be changed, MPF input is required. 48.6.2.  Health  and  Comfort  Items.  Members  in  confinement  may  be  authorized  health  and comfort  payments  (AFI  31-205)  if  member  is  in  a  non-pay  status.  Comfort  payments  for prisoners  are  paid  out  of  local  O&M  funds  and  not  reported  to  DJMS.  When  health  and comfort items are furnished to a person in a pay status, they are paid for from the individual's personal funds or charged against his or her pay account. (See DoDFMR, Vol 10, chapter 12.) Handle billings as shown below: 48.6.2.1.  The United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, will prepare a DD Form 504, Request and Receipt for Health and Comfort Supplies, for inmates in a pay status who do not have sufficient funds in their personal deposit account. The  DD  Form  504,is  sent  to  United  States  Air  Force,  HQ  AFSFC/SFC,  1517  Billy 796 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Mitchell, Lackland Air Force Base, TX 78236, who establishes a DS indebtedness on the member's MMPA. 48.6.2.2.  For inmates in a pay status who have sufficient funds in their personal deposit accounts, USDB prepares and sends a DD Form 504 (with an accompanying check from the  USDB  Personal Deposit Fund) to  United  States  Air  Force, HQ  AFSFC/SFCT, 1517 Billy  Mitchell Blvd, Bldg 954,  Lackland  Air  Force  Base,  TX  ,  78236,  as  a  payment to  reimburse  account  21  X  2020.0015  57-310626EB  QLOG  CA2OO  014021  for previous health and comfort supplies received. NOTE:  The reason  for  the  Army line of accounting is that  USDB at Fort Leavenworth,  KS, is an Army confinement facility and the health and comfort expenses should be reimbursed to the Army. 48.6.2.3.  A  copy  of  the  DD  Form  504  (with  the  receipt  signature  block  signed)  which was  sent  to  HQ  AFSFC/SFC  will  be  returned  to:  U.S.  Disciplinary  Barracks,  HQ AFSFC/DET1, 1301 N.

When a  member's mental  competency is  in  doubt,  or  when  competency  or incompetency  is  established,  certain  pay-affecting  actions  are  required.   Servicing  FSO  retains responsibility  for  member  pending  official  determination  of  competency.    When  a  member  is officially  declared  mentally  incompetent,  responsibility  for  pay  service  is  transferred  to     DFAS-DE. 50.2.  Substantiating  Documents.  Any  one  of  these  items  is  acceptable  evidence  of competency  or incompetency: 50.2.1.  A  copy  of  AF  Form  618,  Medical  Board  Report,  signed  by  chairman  of  the board  and  approved  by  the  commander.    This  form  may  be  accompanied  by  SF  502, Medical  Record-Narrative  Summary.  It  must  specifically  state  that  member  is  mentally incompetent to be acceptable evidence of that condition. 50.2.2.  A certified copy of court orders of a court of competent jurisdiction. 50.2.3.  A report of findings by an Army or Navy medical board. 50.2.4.  Determination of competency or incompetency by Veterans Administration. 50.3.  Responsibilities.  Servicing  FSO  retains  responsibility  for  member  pending  official determination  of  competency.    When  a  member  is  officially  declared  mentally  incompetent, responsibility for pay service is transferred to DFAS-DE. 50.3.1.  Medical Board.  General provisions for appointing and convening a medical board to which  a  patient  is  referred  for  physical  evaluation  are  in  AFI  36-3212.    If  patient  is believed to be mentally incompetent, this also applies: 50.3.1.1.  Board must consist of at least three qualified medical officers, one of whom is specifically qualified to treat mental disorders. 50.3.1.2.  When an Air Force member is a patient in a federal hospital, board is appointed by  head of department  or agency providing  medical treatment  from among any  medical officers or physicians reported to be available by the hospital manager. 50.3.1.3.  When  an  Air  Force  member  is  a  patient  in  a  hospital  under  United  States jurisdiction,  board  is  appointed  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  from  among  any medical officers reported to be available by the Surgeon General of the Air Force. 50.3.2.  Initial  Notice.    When  the  competency  of  a  member  confined  to  a  service  hospital becomes  doubtful,  commander  of  the  hospital  notifies  member's  FSO  by  letter.    FSO immediately forwards a copy of this letter to servicing MPF. 50.3.3.  Discharge  or  Retirement  for  Physical  Disability.  MPF  will  submit  final  separation transaction for member. 50.4.  FSO Actions.  Upon receipt of notice under paragraph 50.2.2 takes the following action: 50.4.1.  Local Payee.   Suppresses all regular local payments.    Resume payments  only upon notification that member is mentally competent. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 821 50.4.2.  Central  Payee.

If support of dependents is required.  (See Chapter 57.) 50.4.4.  Upon receipt of appropriate documentation (see  paragraph 50.1), FSO removes pay suppression to resume regular local payments if the member is found competent, or to transfer member's  management subparagraph 50.4.1 above for procedures when central payee is found competent. to  DFAS-DE/FJPC file See   if found incompetent. 50.4.5.  Data Elements and Codes.  Pertinent codes and their uses are: 50.4.5.1.  Status  Pending  Determination  of  Competency  or  Incompetency.  See  Chapter 49.  Input as action indicator 03--report or 04--change. 50.4.5.2.  Member  Found  Incompetent.  Input  as  action  indicator  04--change;  format identification SU--mentally incompetent. 50.4.5.3.  Member  Subsequently  Returned  to  Competency.    DFAS-DE/FJ  prepares appropriate input; no input is required from base level. 50.4.6.  Management File Entry.  Servicing FSO notes all status actions in memoranda section of case file.  Include citation to voucher payment for comfort items. 50.4.7.  FSO  Actions.    FSO,  upon  receiving  notice  that  a  member  has  been  officially declared mentally incompetent, sends to DFAS-DE/FJPC: 50.4.7.1.  copy of AF Form 618 and copy of SF 502, unless previously forwarded; 50.4.7.2.  substantiating documents to support any change in the MMPA; 50.4.7.3.  statement as to whether a legal guardian has been or will be appointed, and, if appointment has been made, a certified copy of the court order; and 50.4.7.4.  if no court appointment is contemplated, name, address, and relationship of any relative  who  might  be  eligible  to  act  as  trustee.    Any  person,  preferably  in  order  of precedence shown below, is eligible if at least 21 years old: 50.4.7.4.1.  lawful wife or husband of incompetent (age requirement may be waived in this case); 50.4.7.4.2.  legitimate or legally adopted son or daughter of incompetent; 50.4.7.4.3.  either parent or both parents of incompetent; 50.4.7.4.4.  head of institution where member is committed; or 50.4.7.4.5.  any  other  person(s),  if  such  designation  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the incompetent. 50.4.7.5.  ATRAS Travel History Print.  If this document is not maintained by same FSO, the  FSO  advises  custodian  to  submit  the  history  print  to  DFAS-DE  by  AF  Form  1209, Document Transmittal (DJMS).   822 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 50.5.  Effect on MMPA: 50.5.1.  Continues accruals of other entitlements unless stopped by separate input. 50.5.2.  Continues  regular  central  payments  for  deposit  to  member's  account  until  status  is changed to mentally incompetent. 50.6.  Special  Provisions.  Comfort  Items  While  in  Hospital.  Upon  determination  (actual  or pending)  that  a  member  is  mentally  incompetent,  the  commander  of  the  medical  facility  may designate an officer of that command to receive a sum of no more than $10 per month to purchase comfort items for the use and benefit of the patient, provided patient has no other funds available for such use.  Member must be able to use items purchased, must desire such items, and they must be  beneficial  to  his  or  her  comfort  and  well-being.  Funds  are  receipted  for  by  the  designated officer and are accounted  for as described  by the Director of Base Medical Services.  (See AFI 41-120, paragraph 10-40.) 50.6.1.  Local Payment.  Make payment as partial pay (see Chapter 36).  Include on voucher the name of the member in whose behalf payment is made and authority for payment.

Description.  Missing Status is defined in the Definitions in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, as including  missing,  missing  in  action,  interned  in  a  foreign  country,  captured,  beleaguered, besieged  by  a  hostile  force  or  detained  in  a  foreign  country  against  member's  will.   Policy  on entitlements  and  the  authority  to  make  payments  to  persons  in  missing  status  are  contained  in DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 3. 51.2.  Substantiating Documents.  DD Form 1300, Report of Casualty, issued by AFPC, is the official document reporting a member absent in a status covered by the Missing Persons Act. 51.3.  FSO Actions.  Within 48 hours after receiving DD Form 1300, FSO: 51.3.1.  Submits all related documents with management case file to DFAS-DE/FJP.  Include: 51.3.1.1.  Copy of "missing" telegram message. 51.3.1.2.  Copy of DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data. 51.3.1.3.  ATRAS  travel  history  print  or  DD  Form  1588,  Record  of  Travel  Payment,  as applicable. 51.3.1.4.  Unpaid  travel  claims,  DD  Form  1351-2,  Travel  Voucher  or  Sub-voucher, showing itinerary with applicable orders. 51.3.1.5.  Any  MPOs,  documents,  or  orders  authorizing  a  change  in  member's  pay account  (for  example,  start  hostile  fire  incentive  pay  (HFIP),  start  BAQ  because dependents terminated government quarters, etc.). 51.3.1.6.  Any other information pertaining to the situation which would assist DFAS-DE in maintaining the pay account. 51.3.2.  Sends  Management  Case  File  (MCF)  with  above  documents  by  AF  Form  1209, Document  Transmittal  (DJMS).    Mark  MCF,  envelope,  and  transmittal  form  in  red, "Missing in Action."  (See Chapter 2.) 51.4.  Effect  on  MMPA.  When  DFAS-DE/FJP  processes  an  SM04,  the  MMPA  is  affected  as follows: 51.4.1.  The member's status will change from SA to SM. 51.4.2.  The  servicing  ADSN  will  change  to  3897;  however,  the  paying  ADSN  will  not change. 51.4.3.  The LH entry will remain open. 51.4.4.  FITW and SITW, if applicable, will stop, as the pay of members in SM status is not subject to withholding.  (See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 44 through 54.) 51.4.5.  BAS,  type  H,  will  start  for  enlisted  members  effective  the  date  of  the  SM  status.  (See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 32 through 37.) AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 825  51.4.6.  BAQ  at  the  without  dependents  rate  will  be  started  for  single  members,  effective date  of  the  SM  status,  if  the  member  was  not  previously  receiving  BAQ.  See  DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 32 through 37.  For other MIAs, entitlement continues as it was prior to SM status. 51.4.7.  Clothing  Replacement  Allowance (CRA)  will  stop, the CRA  future  will be  deleted and  the member will be paid CRA from the date of the last payment through the end of the month  that  the  SM  status  started,  since  CRA  does  not  accrue  while  a  member  is  in  SM status.  (See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, table 34-2, note 2.) 51.4.8.  If  the  member's  ETS  expires  while  in  an  SM  status,  pay  and  allowances  will continue per 37 U.S.C. 552. 51.4.9.  Leave continues to accrue without regard to the 60/90 day limitation.  (See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 32-37.) 51.5.  Special Provisions: 51.5.1.  Member declared dead.  (See Chapter 54.) 51.5.2.  Member Returned to Military Control. 51.5.2.1.  Continuing  MCF.    If  member  returns  to  military  control  before  MCF  is sent  to DFAS-DE, the  FSO  having  custody  of  MCF  maintains it in the normal  manner.  Return copy of DD Form 93 to appropriate MPF or personnel activity. 51.5.2.2.  Notice  to  DFAS-DE  of  Member's  Return.    If  member  returns  to  military control  after  MCF  has  been  sent  to  DFAS-DE,  MPF  serving  the  activity  to  which member first reports to military control notifies DFAS-DE/FJP by priority message. 51.5.2.3.  Transfer  of  MCF  and  Maintenance  of  MMPA.    When  DFAS-DE  receives notice that member has returned to military control, DFAS-DE/FJP sends MCF to proper FSO.    A  summary  of  MMPA  and  allotments  paid  by  DFAS-DE  is  furnished.    DFAS-DE  also  returns  copy  of  DD  Form  93,  which  the  FSO  then  forwards  to  appropriate MPF.    If  member  is  to  be  evacuated  to  United  States  for  prolonged  hospitalization  or medical  treatment,  or  is  to  be  returned  for  separation  or  other  reason,  DFAS-DE  does not transfer  servicing responsibility to the overseas  station, but instructs overseas station concerning partial payments. 51.5.2.4.  Partial Payments.  FSO servicing the activity to which returned member reports initially  may  make  partial  payments  to  member.    If  doubt  exists  as  to  the  amount due,  request  from  DFAS-DE  amount  authorized  for  payment.    In  making  partial payment,  follow procedures in Chapter 36. 51.5.2.5.  Full  Settlement.   DFAS-DE  sends  servicing  FSO  a  one-time  pay authorization for arrears of pay and allowances accrued through date of return to military control or last regular pay- day, as appropriate. 51.5.2.6.  Leave  Settlement.    Leave  accumulated  while  in  a  missing  status  is  accounted for separately and paid as soon as possible after member is removed from missing status. 826 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 51.5.2.7.  BAQ/BAS  Stop.    When  member  returns  to  duty,  BAQ  and  BAS  stop.  Servicing  FSO  verifies the  correct  types  of BAQ and BAS if any, and reestablishes the entitlements. 51.5.3.  Cancel  of  Missing  Status  (SM06).    If  MIA  is  canceled  (SM06),  the  member's  pay reverts  to  the  posture  prior  to  SM  status.    SM06  generates  a  U103  management  notice  to DFAS-DE  requiring  a  review,  to  ensure  correct  entitlements  are  started,  and  a  PT03  to  re-establish clothing allowance. 51.6.  DFAS-DE Actions: 51.6.1.  DFAS-DE/FJP prepares input to establish missing status on member's MMPA based on DD Form 1300, prepared per AFI 36-3002.  This input continues member in a pay status as if "present for duty."  Direct deposit of pay and allotments continue to the same location as prior to the change to SM  status.  DFAS-DE/FJP monitors the member's account and works with  dependents  on any  requests  for  changes  (DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapters  32  through 37). 51.6.2.  Input  format.  DFAS-DE  prepares  all  input  for  computer  processing  relevant  to  a missing status. 51.6.3.  Administration of Pay Accounts: 51.6.3.1.  Statutory  Authority.    Chapter  10,  37  U.S.C.,  authorizes  continued  payment  of pay and allowances for military members in a missing status. 51.6.3.2.  DFAS-DE Servicing Responsibility. 51.6.3.2.1.  DFAS-DE/FJP administers the pay accounts of all military members in a missing status.  DFAS-DE is governed by the member's designation providing it is in the best interest of all concerned, and within these criteria, DFAS-DE exercises final authority.  Administration of the pay account includes: 51.6.3.2.1.1.  Maintenance of the MCF; 51.6.3.2.1.2.  Administration  of  allotments  to  dependents  or others  designated  to receive a member's pay while member is in a missing status.  This includes receipt and processing of all applications for start of an allotment, or increase in existing allotments,  by  or  on  behalf  of  dependents  of  the  member  with  proper identification and demonstration of need; 51.6.3.3.  Determination of facts about dependency; 51.6.3.4.  Deposits to and withdrawals from existing SDP accounts of military personnel. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 827  Chapter 52 FINAL SEPARATION 52.1.  Description.  The  Definitions  in  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  defines  separation  as discharge, release from active duty, retirement, death or in the case of enlisted members, the date when they begin to serve on a voluntary extension of enlistment for any period of time. 52.2.  Substantiating Documents: 52.2.1.  DFAS Form 702, Air Force/Army Leave and Earnings Statement (Active and Reserve Force).  DFAS-DE  re-computes  member's  pay,  issues  any  residual  payments  due  member, closes member's pay account, and sends a separation LES to member's future mailing address at DOS plus 20.  An LES for the  new  category is not issued until  next EOM restructure (for example, member separated on 18 March; an LES in the new category is issued as a result of EOM March processing). 52.2.2.  AF  Form  350,  Separation  Pay  Worksheet.    AF  Form  350  will  be  accomplished  on every  separation.  All  manual  computations  will  be  audited  and  certified  by  other  than  the person who prepared the form prior to payment release and filed in SWF. 52.3.  Responsibilities.  DFAS-DE  computes  separation  pay  and  generates  final  pay authorizations  (PQ61).      However,  FSOs  must  ensure  payments  are  proper  even  for authorizations  generated  by DFAS-DE.  If no PQ61 is received and the  separation transaction will be processed before the next regular cutoff, include the amount of the member's net pay and allotments in the final pay computation. 52.4.  FSO Actions.  The FSOs must: 52.4.1.  Advise  members  that  if  a  financial  organization  or  allotment  recipient  fails  to return a payment or allotment, a debt for that amount will result. 52.4.2.  Suppress  payments  and  stop  allotments  if  necessary.    After  cutoff,  contact  DFAS-PMJSAA/ DE to pull allotment payments before mailing, if possible.   DFAS-PMJSAA/DE can be reached at DSN 926-7171, FAX number: DSN 926-6878. 52.4.3.  Advise members that  final  payment  made on  separation  may be adjusted by DFAS-DE, based on a detailed computation of all valid transactions affecting the MMPA, and that the final LES will reflect these adjustments. 52.4.4.  Create  a  suspense  file  for  all  members  the  FSO  places  in  a  T  status  (i.e.,  ST04).  The chief, customer service must review the suspense file monthly to ensure a member is  not in a T status over 30 days.   If  the T  status  continues,  contact  the  MPF  to  process the  necessary  transactions  to either re-enlist, return the member to A status, or separate the member.  Do not remove a case from the suspense file until the appropriate transactions have processed. 52.4.5.  Once  the  transaction  has  flowed  to  separate  the  member,  DJMS  will  automatically accelerate the collection of open debts.  The FSO must review these debts and ensure that the collection  rate  does  not  exceed  two-thirds  collection.    For  debts  being  collected  under  5 828 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 USC  5514  (i.e.  VA,  DOE)  suspended  these  debts.    If  there  are  any  monies  from  final  pay, these debts may be collected then. 52.4.6.  Maintain  close  coordination  with  the  member's  servicing  MPF  to  ensure  separation transactions are processed in a timely manner. 52.5.  Special  Provisions.  When  regular  pay  is  suspended  because  of  final  separation  activity, the  MMPA  is  placed  in  ST  status  (T  status).    The  suspension  reason  code  appearing  on  the MMPA  further  identifies  the cause and conditions of the suspension.  For all codes, regular pay authorizations have been zeroed.  If T  status  processes  after  cutoff  for  the  pay  period  in  which DOS occurs, pay authorizations can be outstanding for after-DOS payment even though MMPA is in T-status.   However, allotments may or  may not  be  paid  for  the  month  of  DOS,  depending on  whether  the  member  is  retiring  and  the  T-status  processed  before  end  of  month  (EOM) cutoff  for  the  month  of  DOS.    Suspension  reason  codes  are  often  cited  in  communications between FSO and DFAS-DE technicians. 52.5.1.  Hardship  Discharge.    If  a  member  assigned  overseas  obtains  a  hardship  discharge while  on  leave  in  CONUS,  the  overseas  FSO  initiates  PCS  to  CONUS  base  and  overseas MPF initiates the E503 (separation).  The gaining CONUS FSO processes PCS arrival, then handles separation as the servicing FSO. 52.5.2.  Terminal  Leave.    If  a  member  assigned  overseas  is  sent  PCS  to  another  base  for terminal leave, the overseas FSO submits the PCS departure, the overseas MPF submits the E503  and  the  gaining  FSO  handles  the  separation  as  servicing  FSO.  The  losing  MPF includes  the  AF  Form  988,  Leave  Request/Authorization,  in  member's  records  sent  to  the gaining MPF who sends it to the new servicing FSO for processing. 52.5.3.  Administrative or Medical Hold.   If the MPF updates a  member's  ETS/DOS  before the  next  scheduled  payday,  no  manual  pay  computation  is  required.    If  a  separation transaction is submitted, the local MPF processes an E506 transaction.  The MPF extends the member's  DOS  (E6)  for  90  days  to  adjust  the  ETS/DOS.  Any  further  extensions  are accomplished in monthly increments.  If a separation transaction is submitted, the local MPF extends the DOS for 3 months.  These cases are managed by the MPF and FSO on a case-by-case basis.  When necessary, the FSO  confirms status for pay and allowances with the MPF for any period beyond current DOS and manually computes payments. 52.6.  Payment  Processing.  Request  all  separation  payments  be  made  by  DFAS-PMJS/DE using  daily  EFT  procedures.    If  a  member  has  a  valid  waiver  for  EFT  participation,  payment may  be  made  locally. Separation  payments  are  not  authorized  before  DOS  (member’s  DOS  is used  as  effective  date  on  CICS  transaction  ID  “JPBB”),  however,  reserve  officers  who  are authorized  travel  time  may  be  paid  separation  pay  on  the  day  before  starting  travel.  NOTE: Once  an  MMPA  goes  to  “V”  (separated)  status,  daily  EFT  is  no  longer  available.    Daily  EFT does  not  process  any  “V”  status  account  payments.    Open  “PX”  pay  authorizations  reflecting ADSN of 3885, after the MMPA is in “V” separated status, must be paid by the FSO, using local procedures, and posted to the MMPA as a PQ payment. 52.6.1.  For  central  payees,  CICS  trans  ID  ‘JPBB’  and  ‘JPBX’  are  used  to  request  and confirm payment.  A PQ03 payment transaction is generated and posted to the members pay record  when  the  separation  payment  is  sent  to  the  member’s  financial  institution  (see paragraph 38.9.3 for a more detailed explanation of the ‘JPBB’ and ‘JPBX’ CICS trans ID). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 829  52.6.2.  For local payees, enter a payment transaction (PQ) on every monetary separation.  Do not post separation payments as a partial (PK) or casual (PC) payment (see  Figure 52.6  for the PQ format). 52.6.3.  Final separations are updated at DOS plus 20 days.  The MMPA is closed and if any residual  money  is  due  the  member,  a  PQ  authorization  is  generated.  If  the  new  pay authorization has an ADSN of 3885, it is the responsibility of the last servicing FSO to make payment  locally,  since  daily  EFT  will  not  process  for  V  status  accounts.    If  the  new  pay authorization  has  an  ADSN  of  3892,  DFAS-PMJCAC/DE  will  forward  residual  amount  to member’s local address. 52.6.4.  A manual computation is required on every separation.  Once the manual computation is  complete,  pay  100%  of  the  computed  amount.  The  only  reason  for  not  paying  100%  is specified  in  Figure  52.2.  If  the  amount  paid  the  member  does  not  equal  the  amount authorized, follow procedures in paragraph 52.14.6.3. 52.7.  Separation Indebtedness Report.  A monthly report of all separation debts is provided to all  major  commands  and  FSOs.    Debt  information  is  included  on  each  separatee.    Review  the report  and  determine  corrective  action  necessary  to  prevent  future  occurrences.    Inquiries concerning  separation  debts  are directed to MAJCOM.  MAJCOMs contact DFAS-PMJPO/DE (Debt and Claims Management). 52.8.  Separation  Processing  Procedures  for  Overseas  Members.  Members  stationed overseas immediately prior to separation have the option of separating at any other base.  NOTE: If the MPF processes an E-3 transaction, notify the MPF immediately to cancel and submit an E-5.  No input of an E-3 is authorized. 52.8.1.  Option  1  -  Member  elects  to  separate  at  a  base  in  CONUS.  Members  electing  this option  will  be  considered  in  a  PCS  status  for  entitlement  purposes.    No  PCS  advances  are authorized.    Member  will  hand  carry  the  out-processing  checklist  and  a  completed  AF Form 350.   With the  exceptions below, members will be normally separated. 52.8.1.1.  Losing  FSO  processes an  SH03  transaction  with an  effective  date  of  the  port call  to  stop  overseas  allowances.    Inform  members  that  they  must  report  to  the  base  of choice before starting leave or permissive TDY.   PTDY is for transition purposes, house hunting/job  hunting,  and  will  not  be  taken  overseas  if  the  member  elects  this  option.  Permissive  TDY  (PTDY)  and  terminal  leaves  are  approved  by  the  losing  commander, prior to departure, on AF Form 988.  If the AF 988 shows a address of overseas, return it to the orderly room.  Do not process.  If PTDY is not taken in conjunction with terminal leave,  and  is  used  as  a  stand  alone,  the  losing  orderly  room  assigns  the  leave  number and  processes  the  leave  accordingly.    If  the  PTDY  is  taken  with  the  terminal leave/DOS,  the  gaining  FSO  assigns  both  the  PTDY  and  leave  numbers  and  processes both  after  arrival.    AF  Form  988  is  hand  carried  by  the  member  to  the  CONUS processing  base.    NOTE:    If  terminal  leave  is  taken  in  conjunction  with  PTDY,  FSO may issue a leave number more than 14 days prior to the effective date of terminal leave. This  ensures  both  the  PTDY  and  terminal  leave  are  processed  prior  to  member's departure. 52.8.1.2.  The gaining FSO processes an SG03 transaction to complete the PCS.  Obtain a copy  of the  travel  voucher  from  the  travel  SMA  for  use  as  the  source  document.  If  the 830 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 arriving member is already in 'T' status, generated by the E503, the SG will not process, contact local MPF to cancel the original E5.  After cancellation, input the SG, leave, etc., and notify MPF to re-accomplish the E503. 52.8.1.3.  Adjustments  to  pay  and  entitlements  affected  by  the  PCS,  may  be  required (i.e.,  VHA,  Single  BAQ,  BAS).  Start  interim  VHA  for  members  with  dependents, effective on date of arrival, using the zip code for the CONUS processing base.   If VHA is already paying, for dependents, continue the same rate and zip code.  Start BAS, Type B, for all enlisted members, using one. 52.8.1.4.  Gaining FSO pays 100 percent of final separation pay on the member's DOS, no sooner.  A  manual  computation  will  be  accomplished  to  verify  against  the  final authorization  since  adjustments  may  not  be  accomplished  in  time.  Local  FSO  is responsible for any open pay authorization under 3885 that appears after the MMPA goes into “V: status.  This payment is made by the FSO, using local payment procedures, and posted to the MMPA as a PQ payment. 52.8.2.  Option  2  -  Members  electing  to  separate  under  this  option  will  be  completely separated  by the  overseas  FSO.   Under  this option, the  member  elects  to return to CONUS and not out-process through a  base.   Normal CONUS  separation procedures  will be used.  As  with  option  1  above,  no  PCS  advances  are  authorized.  100  percent  of  the  final separation  payment  will  be  made  by  the  losing  FSO  on  the  member's  DOS,  after confirmation  is  received  from  the  MPF  that  the  member  arrived  in  CONUS.    Do  not make  the  final  payment  until  the  member's  DOS  and  only  after  the  MPF  has  confirmed contact  with  the  member.  Local  FSO  is  responsible  for  any  open  pay  authorization  under 3885 that appears after the MMPA  goes into “V” status.  This  payment  will be made by the FSO, using local payment procedures, and posted to the MMPA as a PQ payment. 52.8.2.1.  Leave numbers for a stand alone PTDY will be assigned by the orderly room.  Leave  numbers  for  terminal  PTDY (no  terminal  leave  taken)  can  be  assigned  by  either the orderly room or the FSO.  Effective date of the PTDY/terminal leave is the day after the member’s port call. 52.8.2.1.1.  For  members  who  are  separating  overseas  but  taking  PTDY/terminal leave  elsewhere,  stop  all  station  allowances  effective the PTDY/terminal leave effective date. the  day  before 52.8.2.1.2.  PTDY/terminal  leave  cannot  be  taken  overseas  unless  the  member provides  documentation  containing  the  host  country’s  approval  for  the  member  to separate  overseas.    In  this  case,  the  station  allowances  continue  until  the  member’s DOS. 52.8.2.2.  All  overseas  station  allowances  must  be  manually  stopped  prior  to  departure from the overseas area, effective the day before the port call.  If the member is receiving VHA  for  dependents  in  CONUS,  the  VHA  entitlement  continues.    No  new  VHA  is authorized for arrival in CONUS. 52.9.  What-If  Separation Processing.  The on-line "What-If" Separation Processing System is a unique system that is designed to produce a quick automated  pay computation  for  separations where  the  separation  transaction  (E5) has  not been  submitted to DJMS  by  MPF.   The  What-If AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 831  process  does  not  update  the  MMPA;  therefore,  manual  adjustments  must  be  made  for  all unposted transactions at the time of separation. 52.9.1.  FSO: 52.9.1.1.  Accesses  the  What-If  through  CICSJ3  by  keying  in  "JPAM."    Follow  the directions on the screen. 52.9.1.2.  During  the  What-If  processing  all  E573s  are  processed  and  member's separation  pay  is  computed.    The  system  appears  "down"  during  this  time  (a  few minutes). 52.9.1.3.  After  processing,  a  facsimile  LES  print  can  be  requested  in  JPAM  (Ref Attachment 2, this regulation) and FSO will receive prints. 52.9.1.4.  File the facsimile LESs in SWF. 52.9.2.  DFAS-DE: 52.9.2.1.  After LESs are requested and printed at the FSO, E573 transactions are deleted from the files and new E573 transactions may be received. 52.9.2.2.  If  E573  fails  to  process,  an  error  code  revealing  why  a  transaction  failed  to process will be issued. 52.9.3.  Time  period.    This  system  will  compute  the  member's  separation  pay  any  time within the 10-day window prior to member's DOS in the "What-If" E573 transaction. 52.9.4.  Helpful Hints: 52.9.4.1.  Since  the  What-If  system  emulates  the  DJMS,  any  transaction  that  would reject under DJMS, will also reject in What-If. 52.9.4.2.  Negative figures will appear on the facsimile LES when the E573 is submitted between  MER and the  end  of the  current  month and the DOS  is also in  current  month.  (Example:   E573,  with DOS 28  APR, is  submitted 28  Apr.    Since  we are now in  May posture, LES will reflect negative figures). 52.10.  Computation  of  Separation  Pay.  FSOs  are  required  to  explain  the  separation  pay  to the  separatee.  Use the What-If Separation system, or the AF 350, manual computation.  NOTE: AF 350 is required on every separation. 52.10.1.  PQ61 includes amounts due for disability severance pay, readjustment pay, variable separation  incentive,  selective  separation  bonus,  lump  sum  leave  sold,  and  any  other separation pay due the member. 52.10.2.  Disability severance pay is included in the PQ61 generated by DJMS.  This amount is  based  upon  data  furnished  in  the  separation  transaction.    DJMS  will  tax  disability severance  pay  for  members  with  a  continuous  active  service  date  of  25  Sep  1975  or  later, per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, paragraph 350404. 52.10.2.1.  If  disability  severance  pay  was  taxed  and  the  member  meets  the  exception criteria  in  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  35,  notify  DFAS-DE/FJPS  by  message  and request  a  TD  Form  W-2C.   Do  not  make  a  payment  for  taxes  that  are  to  be  refunded.  832 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 DFAS-DE/FJPS  will  make  a  supplemental  payment  when  tax  reports  to  IRS  or  state are reconciled and TD  Form  W-2C  is issued. 52.10.2.2.  If  the  member  has  an  open  debt  (ADSN  3891),  in  addition  to  standard  data pertinent to the member's separation, a message must be sent to DFAS-PODE/DE (Debt and Claims Management) providing the reason or authority for not taxing the disability severance pay so they can make necessary adjustments and issue the TD W-2C. 52.10.3.  Discharge  Gratuity.    If  the  member  qualifies  for  discharge  gratuity  under  the provisions of the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 35, paragraph 3506, the amount authorized is reported in the E5 transaction and creates an open PQ on the MMPA.  If the amount has not been reported  with the E503 transaction,  and  has  not  created  an  open  PQ  payment  and  set up a case for discharge gratuity in the case management system (CMS).  Include entitlement amount and payment date in the remarks area of CMS. 52.10.4.  All  other  amounts  included  in  PQ61  are  taxed  as  appropriate  and  included  in  the TD Form W-2 issued at the end of the year. 52.10.5.  Open  Debts.    Upon  receipt  of  an  E5,  DJMS  re-computes  the  repayment  schedule for  debts  established  on  the  MMPA  to  determine  if  the  current  repayment  schedule  will liquidate the debt by the DOS  in  the  E5.   All open  debts,  except  those  suspended  by action indicator  18,  will  be  re-computed.  If  the  current  repayment  schedule  will  not  liquidate  the debt  by  the  DOS  in  the  E5,  a  new  repayment  schedule  is  generated  and  an  XD03 management  notice is  sent  to the  servicing  FSO, advising  of the  new  repayment  schedule.  The  two-thirds  rule  still  applies  unless  the  member  has  consented  to  a  higher  rate  of collection.  If the acceleration of the debts exceeds the two-thirds rule, process the necessary change  (04)  transaction  to  decrease  the  collection  rate.  If  any  of  the  accelerated  debts  are being  collected  under  5  USC  5514  (i.e.  VA,  DOE),  suspend  these  debts.    If  monies  are available  from the member’s final pay, collect then.  NOTE:  If advance pay was paid based on a  signed DD Form 2560,  Advance  Pay Certification/Authorization,  withholding  may  be increased to a rate of 100 percent of the member's current or final pay to satisfy the repayment before DOS. 52.10.6.  Anticipated Debts.   Since no actual  debt  exists  prior  to a  member's DOS in  some circumstances,  withholding  of  pay  for  an  anticipated  debt  is  not  authorized  unless  the member  consents  in advance.    For  cash  collection  of  an  anticipated  debt,  see  Chapter  69.  Such  withholding  of pay may  be  done  when the  member has  consented  to  the  withholding at  the time  of  the  payment/request.    By  virtue  of  signing  the  form,  the  member  has  given prior consent to start collection of the following anticipated debts. 52.10.6.1.  Recoupment  of  unearned  SRB.    A  bonus  paid  based  on  a  signed  AF  Form 901, Reenlistment  Eligibility  Annex to DD  Form 4,  dated  August 1990.  Process a  held pay transaction. 52.10.6.2.  Advance  Leave.    Leave  charged  from  AF  Form  988  (September  1991 edition)  which exceeds the member's leave balance at DOS.  The withholding begins as soon as notification of a pending separation is received from a reliable source at a rate of withholding  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  anticipated  debt  no  later  than  the  member's requested/projected  DOS.    This  may  necessitate  withholding  100%  of  the  member's current  or  final  pay as authorized by the  signed consent  statement.    Process  a  held  pay AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 833  transaction.  NOTE:    Withholding  may  still  be  accomplished  if  a  earlier  version  of  the form was used for the request, however, the two-thirds rule must be applied. 52.10.6.3.  Advance pay.  As in advance leave above, member has given prior consent to offset  by  signing  DD  Form  2560,  Advance  Pay  Certification/Authorization.    Process  a DT04 transaction to increase monthly withholding. 52.11.  Separation  Pay  Adjustment  Code.  This  code  in  the  PQ61  or  XS03  indicates  if  the regular pay authorization is outstanding for the pay period in which DOS occurs.  The amount in the  PQ/XS  is  based  on  data  posted  to  the  MMPA  before  the  notice  was  prepared.    FSO  must check to ensure all recent  transactions  posted  before  the  PQ/XS  was  created  and  if  not,  adjust the  PQ/XS  accordingly.    Check  for  any  rejected  transactions  as  well  as  unposted  payments (other  than  regular  pay)  or  leave.  If  an  unposted  transaction  will  increase  the  amount  due  the member, increase  only the  net amount.  Any residual  will be  paid  when the MMPA is  closed at DOS + 20. 52.11.1.  Code  1:    Regular  pay  authorizations  are  zero  for  pay  periods  ending  on  or  after DOS.  (Note 1) 52.11.2.  Code  2:    Mid-month  pay  will  be  paid  by  DFAS-DE.    PQ/XS  allows  for  such payment. (Notes 1 and 2) 52.11.3.  Code 3:  Same as code 2 but for EOM pay.  (Notes 1 and 2) 52.11.4.  Code  4:    PQ/XS  does  not  include  mid-month  pay  amount.    If  you  suppress  mid-month  pay,  add  that  amount  to  the  PQ  or  subtract  that  amount  from  the  XS  and  pay  the adjusted amount.  (Notes 2 and 3) 52.11.5.  Code 5:  Same as code 4 but for EOM pay. NOTES: 1.   Pay amount shown in the PQ61 or collect amount in XS03.   2.    The  regular  pay  authorization  outstanding  includes  payment  for  entitlements  as though  member  were  on  active  duty  through  last  day  of  pay  period, regardless  of actual DOS.  The PQ/XS has been adjusted to collect the regular pay authorizations overpayment. 3.   If regular pay for mid-month or EOM is not suppressed, pay amount of the PQ61 or collect the amount  of the  XS03.   If  collection  of the  indebtedness  is  not  possible, and regular pay could not be suppressed, contact DFAS-PMJS/DE immediately. 52.12.  MPF  Procedures.  Inputs  E503  for  separations  as  early  as  possible  (up  to  120  days before DOS). Inputs change or cancel transactions when needed. 52.13.  DFAS-DE Procedures.  Actions apply to all separations except as otherwise stated. 52.13.1.  Issues zero regular pay authorization when the E5 is received before cutoff for pay period of DOS.  If an E5 is received after DOS, the PQ61 is reduced by the amount of regular pay for pay period in which DOS occurs.  The separation pay adjustment code advises FSO of regular pay authorization status. 834 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 52.13.2.  Stops  Allotments.    For  non-retirees,  allotments  are  automatically  stopped  at  the end  of  the  month  prior to month of  separation  with the  exception of  VEAP.   If  member is retiree, allotments are allowed  to  continue  through  month  of  DOS.   If  E5  is  received  after month-end  cutoff  for  month  of DOS, allotments for non-retirees are stopped month of DOS and the PQ61 is reduced accordingly and can cause a debt at DOS. 52.13.3.  Issues advisory separation notices and authorizations: 52.13.3.1.  If E5 is received 10 or more days before DOS, issues an XS03 (advance debt notice)  to  the  servicing  FSO  on  the  day  the  E5  processes.    E5  will  recycle  until  10 days before DOS and issue PQ61 or XS03 (advance debt notice). 52.13.3.2.  If E5 is received after DOS, issues no notices or authorizations.  It is assumed that  the  member has separated and the FSO  has  manually  computed  separation  pay and made a payment. 52.13.4.  Re-computes  separation  and  closes  MMPA.    At  DOS  plus  20,  DFAS-DE  posts recycling PQ03 and re-computes  separation  settlement to include any transactions  posted to the  MMPA  since the  PQ61  was  issued.   MMPA  is  placed  in  separated  (V)  status.   If  the member  is  due  a  residual amount,  after  the  MMPA  goes  into  V  status,  and  the  open  pay authorization  reflects  ADSN  3885,  DFAS-DE  does  not  pay.    The  local  FSO  makes  this payment  using  local  payment  procedures.    If  the  open  pay  authorization  reflects  3892, DFAS-PMJCAC/DE will  make the payment via hard copy check.  If the member’s MMPA reflects and ADSN of 3891, there is an open debt on the MMPA. 52.13.5.  Issues TD Form W-2.  Normal W-2 processing at the end of the calendar year for all separatees. 52.14.  Servicing FSO Procedures: 52.14.1.  On  first  notification  that  member  is  separating,  reviews  and  updates  member's SWF.    Files  all  pay-affecting  documentation  (including  separation  or  retirement  orders), received  from  date  of  notification  of  separation  in  SWF,  starts  action  to  resolve  any suspense  items,  and  inputs  any  delinquent  or  required  transactions.    Maintains  SWF  for  6 months after MMPA goes into V status. 52.14.2.  Members  receiving BAQ  for  primary  dependents  must re-certify their  entitlement prior to departing on terminal leave or PCS to new servicing FSO for separation, unless re-certification has been accomplished within the last 6 months. 52.14.3.  When  a  member  retires,  allotments  are  paid  through  month  of  retirement  if sufficient  pay is available.    Allotments  paid  through  month  of  retirement  (except  charity, and  Air  Force  Assistance  Fund)  are  transferred  to  member's  retired  pay  account.    Only 15  allotments  can  be  transferred  to  retired  pay.    Member  must  review  allotments  and advise  FSO  to  stop  or  change  allotments  no  later  than  month  before  month  of  retirement.  For example, if retirement date is in June, stops must not be later than 31 May. 52.14.4.  Allotments  for  non-retirees  are  stopped  end-of-month  before  separation  except for allotments to Veteran's Educational Assistance Program (VEAP).  If there is enough pay due member, the VEAP allotment is stopped the month of separation; if not, the allotment is stopped  month  before  separation.    Starts  or  increases  must  be  processed  before  MMPA  is placed in T-status. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 835  52.14.5.  On receipt of XS03, conducts research to determine cause of debt projected at DOS and notifies member.  Takes action to collect indebtedness by DOS. 52.14.6.  On receipt of the PQ61 or XS03: 52.14.6.1.  Checks  separation  pay  adjustment  code  in  PQ61  or  XS03.    If  code  4  or  5 shows local pay authorization outstanding, determine whether the local pay authorization will be suppressed or check canceled and, if so, adjust PQ61 or XS03 accordingly. 52.14.6.2.  Checks  for  transactions  not  yet  posted  to  MMPA  when  PQ61  or  XS03  was issued  (the  PQ61  and  XS03  contain  month  and  day  issued).  Checks  for  rejected transaction.  Gives  particular  attention  to  ensuring  that  all  leave  transactions  and  any partial payments have processed.  Adjusts PQ61 or XS03 accordingly. 52.14.6.3.  If the amount paid the member on final separation does not equal the amount authorized,  determine  the  reason.    If  there  are  unposted item(s),  do  the  input  necessary immediately  so  that  they  post  to  the  MMPA  or  set  up  a  case  on  ACCS  which  will  be transferred to CMS by the CMS system.  If unable to post the items, set up a case in CMS. If the problem is future tax deductions that are not actually posted to the MMPA yet, do not set up a CMS case.  Monitor the MMPA until it goes into V status.  If taxes are posted erroneously  when  the  MMPA  goes  into  V  status,  set  up  a  case  in  CMS  for  taxes  and specify which item was taxed erroneously.  If the MMPA is in 3891 debt status, no CMS case is required. 52.14.7.  Uses  LES,  MMPA,  and  other  data  available  at  base  to  calculate  amount  due  at separation  if  no  PQ61  or  XS03  is  received  from  DFAS-DE.    Decreases  amount  due  for questionable items. 52.14.8.  For  central  payees,  use  the  CICS  trans  ID  ‘JPBB’  to  make  the  payment  (see paragraph  38.9.3  for  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  the  ‘JPBB’  CICS  trans  ID  process).  For local payees, make the payment with check or cash and process the PQ03 for the amount paid. 52.14.9.  Attempts to  make a cash  collection and process a C203 to repay  any  debts.  If  not possible, process debt transactions. 52.14.10.  Advise  member  that  DFAS-DE  will  re-compute  his  or  her  pay  account  at  DOS plus 20.  If pay  was computed in error,  issue a payment  for any remaining residual existing under  the  ADSN  of  3885.  If  DFAS-DE  had  to  manually  adjust  any  entitlements  or deductions  on  the  MMPA  for  any  reason,  and  any  remaining  residual  exist  under  ADSN 3892,  DFAS-PMJCAC/DE  will  mail  a  hard  copy  check  to  the  member.    No  claim  is required.    If  recomputation  shows  indebtedness,  DFAS-PODE/DE  (Debts  and  Claims Management) will notify member and take collection action. 52.14.11.  When  notified  of  a  separation  pending  within  30  days,  check  the  MMPA  for  an NN  (separation  transaction  rejected)  or  N7  (separation  transaction  accepted)  entry.  Notify MPF if neither entry is present.  Review MMPA every few days until N7 is present.  If MMPA is  not in T status  by 10 days before DOS, input ST04.  Review SWF  weekly and, if  trouble persists  with  the  E503  processing,  verify  with  MPF  that  member  has  actually  separated  or retired.  After  you  have  verified  member  actually  separated  and  is  not  reenlisting  or extending, stop allotment(s) month prior to member’s DOS.  If too late for prior month stop, 836 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 stop  month  prior  to  current  month’s  processing  posture.    If  member  is  a  retiree,  not  a separatee,  and  you  have  verified  with  MPF  member  physically  retired;  verify allotment(s) has started on the retired pay system and then stop allotment(s) on member’s T status  MMPA.  If  member  is  a  retiree,  not  a  separatee,  and  you  have  verified  with  MPF member  physically retired; verify allotment(s) has started on the retired pay system and then stop  allotment(s)  on  member’s  T  status  MMPA.  If  you  have  verified  with  local  MPF  that member  retired  and  there  is  no  retired  pay  record  established,  contact  your  MAJCOM immediately  with to: AFPC,DPPRR@RANDOLPH.AF.MIL to alert them to the fact that the member does not have  a  retired  pay  account  established.  Once  the  retired  pay  account  is  established  and allotment(s) started in retired pay, stop allotments on T status MMPA.   MAJCOM  must email this problem. send 52.14.12.  At  DOS  minus  9  days,  check  MMPA  for  NT  (projected  separation  settlement) entry.  The NT contains the  PQ61  or  XS03  amounts  computed  on DOS  minus  10  days.   If no NT is present by DOS, a manual pay computation is required.  Monitor MMPA posting of pay and leave transactions in pipeline as well as posting of the NT entry. 52.14.13.  Payment Computation: 52.14.13.1.  With  an  NT  Entry  Present  check  MMPA  for  multiple  NT  entries.  Use amounts  in  latest  entry.  If  NT  RECOMP-PNDG-INDCTR  is  1,  a  pay-affecting transaction  posted  to  the  MMPA  will  alter  the  NT  and  will  be  included  after  the  next MMPA update.   For  members  on  terminal leave, verify that an open SB  entry is on the MMPA.   Verify  that all recent  FSO-submitted transactions are  posted.   Adjust  PQ61  or XS03.   If  adjustment  changes  the  PQ61  amount  to  a  debt,  check regular  payment and allotment entries  to determine whether regular pay or allotments will be paid after DOS (as  a  result  of  separation  transaction  being  received  after  cutoff).    Suppress  or  cancel local regular pay.  Call DFAS-PMJSAA/DE to stop or recover central pay or allotments, if  possible.    Do  not  make  separation  payment  on  assumption  that  DFAS-DE  will stop or recover an after-DOS payment.   If the  latest NT is  an XS03, check regular payment  and  allotment  entries  for  regular  pay  authorizations  or  allotments  to  be paid  after DOS. Suppress or cancel local regular  pay.  Call DFAS-PMJSAA/DE to stop  or  recover  central  pay  or  allotments,  if  possible.    Do  not  make  separation payment on assumption that DFAS-DE will stop or recover an after-DOS payment. 52.14.13.2.  NT  Entry  Not  Present.    No  separation  transaction  was  received  or  the separation  transaction  rejected.    Manually  compute  the  separation  settlement.    If member the member’s MMPA is not in T status, process ST04 and set up a case on CMS for  the  E5  processing  problem,  if  one  is  not  already  established.    Stop  allotments following  the  logic  in  paragraph  52.14.11    Verify  all  terminal  leave  taken  is  posted.  Verify  all  recent  FSO  submitted  transactions  are  posted.  Manually  compute  separation settlement and pay separated  member 100% of all monies due  him or her through DOS.  Complete  AF  Form  350  for  every  separation.  If  the  amount  paid  on  separation  is different  that  the  NT  authorized,  FSO  must  research  the  difference  and  either  process the unposted items causing the difference, or set up a case in CMS for unposted item.  If the difference is tax deductions, do not set up a case in CMS until the MMPA goes into V status.  If taxes are not corrected when the MMPA converts to V status and the MMPA is not  correct,  set  up  a  tax  case  on  CMS  at  that  time.    CMS  case  number  should  be referenced  in  member’s  SWF.    If  computation  results  in  a  debt  and  central  pay  or AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 837  allotments will be paid after DOS, call DFAS-PMJSAA/DE to see  if  pa y  or  allotment ca n  be  reca lled.   D o  not  mak e  pa yment  on  a ssu mption  that DFAS-PMJSAA/DE will stop or recover after-DOS payments.   File completed AF Form 350 in SWF. 52.14.13.3.  If member completed a PCS within 60 days or there are outstanding leave or payment  transactions  that  were  not  known  on  the  day  the  pay  computation  was  done, monitor  the  MMPA  until  payment  is  made  and  all  other  appropriate  transactions  have posted. 838 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 52.1.  FSO Separation Actions. BASIC OVERVIEW OF SEPARATION PROCESSING                   E5 transactions can be submitted by MPF up to 120 days prior to DOS.  a.   The FSO should: (1)  Establish a Separation Work File (SWF) from the E5 on the MPF JUMPS Transaction Register (JTR) and annotate the SWF with the JTR date and transmission number of the E5.  NOTE:  At this time, check the member's MMPA for possible debts:  recoupment of SRB, excess leave, DF and DV that need repay rate adjustment. (2)    Take  appropriate  actions  to  ensure  collections  are  made  prior  to  DOS. Ensure collection guidance is adhered to. (3)   Compare JTR to ETS BLIS/FSO  information  system  listing.  If no  E5 and member  is  on  BLIS/FSO  information  system  listing,  contact  MPF  and  verify  ETS.  Actions depend on results of verification.  If E5 submitted and member is not on listing, contact MPF and verify ETS.  Actions depend on results of verification. (4)   An N7 is established on the MMPA when the E5 is processed.  b.   At DOS minus 30, FSO receives an XS management notice. (1)   Member will be in debt at DOS. (2)   File XS management notice in SWF. c.   At DOS minus 30, FSO contacts member to determine if member wants separation payment sent to existing financial institution/account number or a different financial institution/account number (see Figure 52.2. for specific FSO actions).    d.   At DOS minus 10:    AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 839 (1)  FSO requests LES print.  LES output is reviewed for outstanding suspense items.  File in SWF. (2)   NT line is established on the MMPA and pay authorization (PQ) is sent to the FSO (or if the member is in debt, an XS03 is sent). (3)  Before final payment, always check for unposted/rejected transactions and adjust PQ accordingly.  Perform manual computation using AF Form 350, Separation Pay Worksheet.  File AF 350 in SWF.  As long as pay authorization belongs to servicing FSO, the servicing FSO must make the payment.  This includes V status members with open PX pay authorization under ADSN of 3885. (4)  If amount paid and PQ authorized differ, FSO must research the difference and either process the unposted items causing the difference or set up a case in CMS for the unposted item.  If the difference is tax deductions, do not set up a case in CMS until MMPA goes into V status.  If taxes are not corrected when the MMPA converts to V status, and the MMPA is not correct, set up a tax case in CMS at that time. NOTES:                    1.   PQ61/XS03 not received at DOS minus 10 and E5 has been submitted:  a.   Check for proper processing of E5 transaction.  Check MMPA for an NN entry.  b.  If transaction rejected back to MPF, member would have an NN entry with the reject code. Contact MPF to re-input.  c.   If no NN entry, check the DTR to see if in a recycle or reject status.  d.  To find out which DTR to check, start with date E5 was submitted (from the JTR provided by MPF) and the E5 should be on that day's DTR.  2.   If E5 has not been submitted, contact MPF to input transaction.  What-If system can normally be utilized for any short notice separations; however, a manual computation will be done on all separations using AF Form 350.   840 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 52.2.  FSO Actions - Normal and Short Notice Separations.          FSO ACTIONS - SEPARATION PROCESSING  (NORMAL AND SHORT NOTICE) FSO actions upon a receipt of notification of a member's separation: a.  The following procedures will apply for servicing FSOs and are to be followed for normal separations as well as short notice.  The FSO is required to use an FSO separation processing checklist on all separations.  You may use checklists developed at base-level, MAJCOM or DFAS-DE. (1)  Upon notification from any reliable source of a pending separation, including:  (a)   MPF-JTR (JUMPS transaction register), (b)  Receipt of a copy of separation orders, (c)  Advance notification, via telecon, from the MPF or member's unit,  (d)   Or PTI 970, Request for Early Separation. (e)  Any administrative action initiated by the squadron or the MPF for the purpose of discharging a member prior to normal date of separation (DOS).  Establish a Separation Work File. (2)  Perform the following actions when the case file has been established: (a)  Check the management case files (MCF) for established or pending debts, or other information that would affect the member's pay, and transfer it to the SWF. NOTE:  Refer to the DoDFMR (DoD Financial Management Regulation), Volume 7A, chapter 50 concerning collection of debts.  (b)   Annotate the SWF with the JTR date and the transmission number of the E5.  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 841  (3)  At DOS minus 30, FSO contacts member to determine where member wants final separation pay sent. (a)   If member elects a different financial institution than current “LH”, he/she must fill out an SF 1199A and attach a voided check. (b)  FSO coordinates with member as to the exact date member wants the new financial institution to be effective. Set up a suspense and process the “LH04” to the member’s MMPA so the new financial institution information will be effective the date the member elects. (c)  If member wants all separation pay to go to current financial institution, make a note of date member was contacted and his/her option and put in member’s SWF. (4)  From DOS minus 30 to minus 10, record XF/XS data in the SWF in the following manner: (a)   dollar amount (b)  number of days accrued leave (c)  date separation notice received (5)  At DOS minus 9 days: (a)   Complete an AF Form 350, Separation Pay Worksheet, required for all separations - short notice or normal. (b)   Contact the organizations identified in Section I of the AF Form 350 and file in the SWF. (6)  At DOS minus 4 days: (a)   Obtain LES history prints and review for outstanding suspense items. (b)   Verify the final separation computation on the AF Form 350. (c)  File the AF Form 350 in the SWF. (d)  Request a new Pay History Print (T20/T21) if the NT authorization 842 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 line amount has changed and cannot be reconciled without a complete manual re-computation. (e)  Compare information from the T20/T21 to the computation shown on the AF Form 350. (f)  Ensure all transactions have processed and, if not, adjust the payment and file in the SWF.     NOTE:  If member is separating from overseas, the member will hand carry a copy of the AF Form 350, and separation checklist. (7)  On DOS: (a)   Compare the latest NT amount to the manual computation amount and payment. (b)  Adjust accordingly. (c)  It is not necessary to call DFAS-PMJCAC/DE for a payment control number. Once final pay computation has been accomplished at base-level, FSO must make final payment to separated member on member’s DOS or any day thereafter. This includes members in V status with open pay authorization of ADSN 3885.  DFAS-PMJCAC/DE is only responsible for open pay authorizations in V status with ADSN of 3892. (8)  No matter when the member’s DOS is established: (a)   Member must obtain a separation checklist from the FSO prior to out processing. (b)  Is required to visit all base agencies noted on the checklist to ensure the FSO has complete information regarding possible indebtedness. NOTE:  Up to 45 percent of the member's total projected final separation pay may be withheld if  the  separation  checklist  was  not  complete, or  for  potential or anticipated  debts.  This is the only time monies may be withheld.  Otherwise, 100 percent of the final pay will be paid.  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 843  Figure 52.3.  Separation Suspension Reason Codes.

Description.  Provisions  for  reenlistment  bonuses  are  contained  in  DoDFMR,  Volume 7A, chapter 9 and in Chapter 12 of this volume. 53.2.  Management Notices and Memo Entries: 53.2.1.  There are  four specialized  MMPA memoranda entries  which relate to reenlistments.  These entries appear on the MMPA and can be displayed on the terminal. 53.2.1.1.  N7 - Reenlistment, Extension, Reentry - Change of Category (ENL to OFF), or Separation  Transaction  Pending.    Contains  transaction  data  held  for  full  MMPA processing.    Reenlistments  and  monetary  extensions  fully  process  DOS  plus  9.    Non-monetary extensions (ERC 911) and change of category (enlisted to officer) fully process on DOS. 53.2.1.2.  NN - Reenlistment, Extension, Reentry - Change of Category (ENL to OFF), or Separation  Transaction  Rejected.    Contains  data  of  rejected  E5  transaction.    Shows error  code  and  if  transaction  rejected  to  MPF  or  DFAS-DE.    Output  control  code  E means  transaction  rejected  to  input  source.  Output  control  code  N  means  transaction rejected to DFAS-DE.  NN entry is deleted when acceptable transaction is received. 53.2.1.3.  NT - Separation Reentry Projected Settlement.  Contains the amount computed for  the  PQ61  or  XS03  management  notice  and  the  days  of  accrued  or  excess  leave.  A new additional NT entry is generated whenever leave or pay transactions process between computation of the first NT and DOS (E5 processing  only).  However, no  new  PQ61 or XS03 notice is issued. 53.2.1.4.  NQ - Reenlistment, Extension, Reentry - Change of Category (ENL to OFF), or Separation Payment to  be  Posted.  Number  contains payment data  from PQ transactions pending  posting  as  a  PQ  when  the  reenlistment,  extension,  change  of  category,  or separation  transaction  is  fully  processed.    PQ  payment  will  also  be  posted  when  NQ entry  is  present  and  an  E506  or  E606  (cancellation)  transaction  is  processed,  causing  a debt in the amount of the payment. 53.2.2.  E6,  Separation  with  immediate  reentry  on  active  duty.    MPF  input,  used  when member  reenlists,  enters  a  voluntary  extension,  or  goes  from  enlisted  to  officer  status. NOTE:  Change of category from officer to enlisted status requires E5 separation transaction with an E2 accession transaction. 53.2.3.  If  member  is  not  changing  categories,  an  LES  is  not  issued.    In  that  case,  remarks concerning  reenlistment  or  extension  of  enlistment  and  remarks  concerning  reenlistment bonus and accrued leave appear on the next LES. 53.2.4.  DD  Form  4,  Enlistment/Reenlistment  Document-Armed  Forces  of  the  United States.  DD Form 4 must be reviewed before releasing a reenlistment bonus payment. 53.2.5.  Notice of Recycling/Unposted PQ Payment (XK04).   An XK04 notice is generated on  the 25th and 42nd days after receipt of the PQ03 payment transaction if a reenlistment or AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 855  extension transaction has not processed and updated the MMPA.  The XK04 is generated to the  FSO  unless  the  transaction  has  rejected  to  DFAS-DE  and  requires  FSO  and  MPF coordination.  The PQ03 transaction also produces  an  MIR  management  notice  at  the  42nd day  point.    MPF  should  ensure  reenlistment  or  extension  transaction  was  input  and  that rejected  transactions are  corrected and  re-input.  If manual intervention  is  required  to  clear a reject  from MPF,  or  to  correct an  erroneous transaction that  has updated the MMPA,  the MPF  must  send  a  message  to  DFAS-PMJ/DE.    FSO  determines  validity  of  payment.  Payment  FID  may  be  erroneous  or  payment  received  after  a  non-monetary  reenlistment  or extension transaction updated the MMPA. 53.3.  Source of Input.  The MPF is responsible for reporting E6 transactions to DFAS-DE up to 120  calendar  days  before  projected  DOS.    The  FSO  is  responsible  for  reporting  reenlistment entitlement  payments  (PQ)  based  on  PQ61  pay  authorization  or  FSO  manual  computation. NOTE:    When  a  member  reenlists  to  obtain  retainability  for  a  program  leading  to  a commission,  the  member  is  not  entitled  to  Selective  Reenlistment  Bonus  (SRB).    When  a member  reenlists  and  is  later accepted into a program leading to a commission, all future SRB installments  are  suspended.  AFPC  identifies  members  affected  by  these  programs.  If  SRB  is erroneously paid or future SRB installments require suspension, AFPC notifies DFAS-DE. 53.4.  Output  Products  from  DFAS-DE.  The  following  output  products  are  transmitted  via JDC when an E6 transaction is received: 53.4.1.  One-Time Pay Authorization (PQ61).  If member is entitled to reenlistment bonus, a one-time pay authorization is generated to the FSO.  Reenlistment bonuses are paid via EFT.  The  pay  authorization  is  sent  to  the  servicing  FSO  and  is  produced  by  the  DJMS  updates between DOS minus 10 days and DOS plus 9 days, depending on when the E6 is received at DFAS-DE. 53.4.2.  New  End-of-Month  or  Mid-Month  Pay  Authorization.    If  a  separation  or  reentry involves  a change of status (ENL to OFF, etc.) or no category change occurs (reenlistment) but pay entitlements are changed, a new pay authorization is generated. 53.5.  Computation  and  Payment  of  One-Time  Payments.  One-time  payment s  and authorizations  include  all  entitlements  due  a  member  upon  reenlistment  or  entering  first extension (SRB, accrued leave, etc.)  less  appropriate  deductions (FITW,  SITW,  recoupment  of bonus).   FITW/SITW amounts are  not refunded on recoupment of Regular Reenlistment Bonus (RRB).  If  member is not  due  money  for reenlistment  or  extension,  an  authorization  for  $0  is generated  to  the  servicing  FSO  for information  purposes only.  FSOs must ensure propriety of payment even if an authorization is generated by DFAS-DE. 53.5.1.  Report of Initial Payment.  If the member is a local payee, input a PQ03 transaction to report  the  initial  payment  to  the  member.    If  the  member  is  a  central  payee,  use  CICS trans  ID  ‘JPBB’  to  request  DFAS-PMJ/DE  make  EFT  payment  to  the  member  (see paragraph  38.9.3  for  a  more  detailed explanation  of  this  payment  process).    The  payment will be reported  by central  site.  If  no  payment transaction is received by DOS plus 9 days, DFAS-DE  processes  the  reenlistment/extension  transaction  and,  if  member  is  due  money, issues  a  PQ11  authorization  to  the  servicing  FSO.    FSO  may  process  a  PQ26  to  release amount into member’s next regular paycheck at member’s request. 856 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 53.5.2.  Report  of  Subsequent  Installment  Payments.    For  central  payees,  the  payment  for annual or advance SRB installments will be paid through the electronic funds transfer system (EFTS).  This PL  payment will be generated from the central site.  For local payees, the PL payment is required for payment of annual or advance installments of SRB.  If a PL payment is  received,  but no  PL authorization  is  present  on  the  MMPA,  the  PL  payment  will  recycle (recycle code RRU).  Recycling  PL payments do not appear on the MMPA, but will appear on the DTR of the payment input source.  DFAS-DE will upda t e  the  MM PA  with  bonu s en titlement  if  authorized.   I f  PL  is  an  e rroneou s  report , DFAS-PMJSAB/DE deletes payment from recycle and posts PL as partial (PK) payment.  The deleting and posting action should  be  requested  by  message  from  the  field.  FSO  does  not  make  the  annual  SRB installment payments. 53.5.3.  Delinquent  Pay  Authorization.    If  a  member  is  due  money  from  a  reenlistment  or extension, and the amount paid is less than the amount due, or the payment transaction was not received when the E6 transaction was fully processed, a PQ11 authorization is generated to the  servicing  FSO.    This  authorization  becomes  delinquent  after  the  next  month-end restructure.  If PQ11 amount is correct and the member is a central payee, the FSO uses CICS trans ID ‘JPBB’ to make the payment to the member (see paragraph 38-9C).   The FSO may, if  the  member  elects  not  to  receive  individual  payment,  release  the PQ11 amount  into the member’s next paycheck by processing a PQ26 transaction (see Figure 52.7).   Exception:  If the  authorization  is  for  enlisted  portion  of  pay  for  month  the  member  is  commissioned, FSO pays the  amount  of the authorization and reports PQ payment using clearing account P530. 53.5.4.  Out-of-Balance  Payments.    If  a  payment  is  reported  for  less  than  the  amount authorized,  the old authorization on the MMPA is closed and a new authorization is opened for the  amount  of  the  difference  between  the  original  authorization,  and  the amount  of  the actual  payment  made.  If  a  payment  is  made  for  this  additional  amount  to  a  local  payee,  it must  be  posted  immediately  as  a  PQ03.    If  the  payment  is  made  to  a  central  payee,  using CICS  trans  ID  “JPBB”  (see  paragraph  38.9.3),  central  site  will  post  the  PQ03.    PQ03 payments reported  prior  to  E6  processing  will  not  cause an  out-of-balance condition  on the MMPA but will generate a PQ11 for the difference between the amount paid and the amount authorized. 53.5.5.  Erroneous  Payment.    If  a  member  is  erroneously  paid  a  bonus  payment,  take  the following steps: 53.5.5.1.  Process a C9 transaction (see Chapter 76 for format). 53.5.5.2.  Coordinate  with  DFAS-DE  to  ensure  detail  processing  of  the  C1/C2 transaction  (see  Chapter  65)  is  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  the  reversal  of  the entitlement.  DFAS-DE will process the reversal of bonus entitlements and refund FITW. 53.5.5.3.  Check  MMPA  daily  until  all  actions  have  processed.  For  proration,  see procedures contained in Chapter 69 of this volume. 53.6.  Establishment of New Pay Account - Reenlistment or Extension of Enlistment: 53.6.1.  DFAS-DE Action.  If a change of status is involved, DFAS-DE takes actions outlined in paragraph 53.6.1  If a change of status is not involved, DFAS-DE: AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 857  53.6.1.1.  Starts  Armed  Forces  Retirement  Homes  (AFRH)  deduction  if  member  was previously in a Reserve component and did not have AFRH deduction. 53.6.1.2.  Continues all other entitlements, deductions, and allotments. 53.6.2.  Base  Input.    If  a  change  in  any  other  entitlement  or  deduction  occurs  because  of separation, specific stop or start input must be submitted.  For example, if orders authorizing BAS do not remain in  effect on reenlistment,  submit normal input  to  stop  BAS as  of DOS.  If  member  is  drawing  flight  pay  non-crew,  and  entitlement  is  to  continue,  submit  normal input  to  start  incentive  pay.    This  entitlement  is  stopped  on  DOS  by  separation  and reenlistment program. 53.7.  Establishment of New Pay Account - Separation with Change of Status: 53.7.1.  DFAS-DE Actions.  DFAS-DE establishes these entitlements and deductions in new period of service: 53.7.1.1.  Basic pay. 53.7.1.2.  Both BAQ and BAS for officers. 53.7.1.3.  FICA and FITW deductions (except additional tax withholdings). 53.7.1.4.  Indebtedness deductions at same monthly rate. 53.7.1.5.  SGLI deductions (if in effect before separation) at same monthly rate. 53.7.1.6.  MGIB  pay  reduction  (if  previously  in  effect)  NOTE:  Allotments  are automatically continued. 53.7.2.  Base Input.  Submit input  to  stop any  of the above items  when applicable.  Input is required  to  start, restart,  or report  entitlements and  deductions  not  continued  by DFAS-DE, including: 53.7.2.1.  BAQ for enlisted members. 53.7.2.2.  FSA. 53.7.2.3.  BAS for enlisted members. 53.7.2.4.  Overseas station allowances. 53.7.2.5.  Incentive pays. 53.7.2.6.  Uniform allowance for officers. 53.7.2.7.  VHA. 53.7.2.8.  Savings Deposit Program. 53.7.2.9.  Held pay transactions, if necessary. 53.7.2.10.  Special Duty Pay. 53.7.2.11.  Additional tax withholding. 53.7.2.12.  Debts  -  if a notice of debt  is received and the  debt  will not  be  satisfied  with pay  for  remaining  portion  of  month  in  new  status,  submit  a  repayment  schedule  to establish  monthly  deduction.    When  debt  is  created  because  of  separation  as  enlisted 858 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 member  early  in  a  month,  a  repayment  schedule  need  not  be  submitted  if  pay  as  an officer for the rest of the month will satisfy the debt. 53.7.2.13.  DDP deduction. 53.8.  Claims.  These rules apply: 53.8.1.  A claim may be submitted to DFAS-POCC/DE for any entitlement which a member feels  due  but  which  was not paid on  separation or reentry.    A  claim is necessary  for lump-sum reserve bonus to an officer.  (See Chapter 74.) 53.8.2.  A member  who believes  he or she is entitled  to a reenlistment bonus  may  submit a claim  for it, if  not paid.  In that case,  complete  documentation  of prior enlistment and  prior bonuses  paid  must  be  submitted.  In  some  cases,  reenlistment  bonus  pay  authorizations  are merely deferred by DFAS-DE because entitlement cannot be determined immediately (i.e., an officer reenlisting as an airman). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 859  Figure 53.1.

Description.  The DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 36, provides the policy concerning death gratuity and  arrears  of  pay  (AOP)  paid  on  behalf  of  deceased  members.   It  states,  in  part,  that death  gratuity  will  be  paid, regardless  of  whether death  occurred in the line  of  duty  or  was the result of the member's misconduct, to eligible beneficiaries of the following: 54.1.1.  Member who dies while on active duty or while traveling to or from such duty. 54.1.2.  Member, or former member, who dies during the 120-day period beginning on the day following  date  of  discharge  or  release,  under  honorable  conditions,  from  active  duty (including  retirement  for  either  disability  or  length  of  service).    In  this  case,  the Administrator of Veteran's Affairs must determine that death resulted from disease or injury incurred  or  aggravated  while  the  member  was  on  active  duty  or  while  in  authorized  travel status to or from such duty. 54.1.3.  Any  person  who  dies  while  traveling  to  or  from  or  while  at  a  place  for  final acceptance, or for entry  upon active  duty (other  than  for training) in the  Military Service, who has been ordered or directed to go to that place, and who: 54.1.3.1.  Has been provisionally accepted for that duty; or 54.1.3.2.  Has  been  selected,  under  the  Military  Selective  Service  Act,  for  duty  in  that Military Service. 54.1.4.  Member  whose  death  is  determined  by  administrative  finding  under  the  Missing Persons Act. (See Chapter 51.) 54.1.5.  Reserve member who dies while traveling directly to or from active duty. 54.1.6.  Any member of a Reserve officers' training corps who dies while performing annual training duty under orders for a period of more than 13 days or while performing authorized travel  to  or  from  that  annual  training  duty;  or  any  applicant  for  membership  in  a  Reserve officers' training corps who dies while attending field training or while performing authorized travel to or from the place where the training is conducted. 54.2.  Substantiating Documents: 54.2.1.  DD  Form  93,  Record  of  Emergency  Data,  contains  information  on  eligible beneficiary or eligible non-designated beneficiary. 54.2.2.

When  the beneficiary  resides  in  the  vicinity  of the  servicing FSO, the servicing FSO will make the death gratuity  payment.  If  the  beneficiary  does  not  reside  in  the  vicinity  of  the  servicing  FSO, assistance  should  be  requested  from  the  FSO  nearest  the  residence  of  the  beneficiary.    This request  is  normally  included  in  the  MPF  notification  of  death  message.    The  FSO  disbursing the  death  gratuity  payment  must  process  the  PE  transaction  to  the  deceased  member's  MMPA immediately after the death gratuity is paid.  If the MMPA is not in SL/SV status, the PE payment 872 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 recycles  awaiting  status  change.

Payment  on  Basis  of  Military  Records.    If  payment  was  made  to  an individual,  based  on  statements  on  military  records  made  by  member  as  to  his  or  her marital  and  dependency  status,  and  there  is  nothing  to  indicate  that  such  status  is incorrect,  do  not  regard  payment  as  erroneous.  In  such  cases,  forward  to  DFAS-AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 875  PMJC/DE  the  claim  of  any  person  entitled  to  payment  if  member's  record  contained official  notice  of  such  person.  Do  not  pay  death  gratuity  to  any  other  claimant  until advised by DFAS-DE. 54.5.12.2.  Administrative  Error.    If  through  administrative  error  (not  caused  by member's  statement  on  locally  available  military  records),  payment  has  been  made  to  a person  clearly  not  entitled,  and  it  is  equally  clear  that  another  claimant  is  entitled  to payment,  do not  delay  or  withhold payment to rightful beneficiary.  The following rules apply: 54.5.12.2.1.  If  conclusive  determination  of  rightful  beneficiary  can  be  made  under provisions  of  this  paragraph,  immediately  pay  beneficiary  locally.  Mail  complete information about erroneous payment to DFAS-PMJC/DE for collection action. 54.5.12.2.2.  If  conclusive  determination  concerning  rightful  beneficiary  cannot  be made,  forward  entire  case  to  DFAS-PMJC/DE  for  determination  and  payment  to rightful beneficiary, and collection action against erroneously paid beneficiary. 54.6.  Allowance for Quarters to Surviving Dependents: 54.6.1.  Conditions  of  Payment.  Dependents  of  members  on  active  duty,  eligible  for government  family  quarters,  may  be  paid  an  allowance  for  quarters  when  members  die  in the line of duty and one of the following conditions exists: 54.6.1.1.  dependents do not occupy government quarters on the date of death; 54.6.1.2.  dependents are occupying  government quarters on a rental basis on the date of death; 54.6.1.3.  dependents vacate government quarters within 365 days of date of death. 54.6.2.  Allowance includes BAQ and VHA or OHA, as applicable, at the rate to which the member would have been entitled prior to death. 54.6.3.  Payment  Order.  Payments  are  to  be  made  to  the  surviving  dependents  in  the following order: 54.6.3.1.  current spouse; 54.6.3.2.  if  no  current  spouse,  divide  equally  among  the  dependents  listed  on  AF Form 594, Application and Authorization to Start, Stop, or Change Basic Allowance for Quarters (BAQ) or Dependency Redetermination. 54.6.4.  Termination  of  Allowance.   Allowance terminates 365  days after the  date  of  death. If,  within  365  days,  dependents  vacate  a  housing  facility  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the Uniformed  Service  which  they occupied  on a non-rental  basis, the allowance  begins on  the day the housing was vacated and continues for 365 days less the number of days the housing facility was occupied following the date of death. 54.6.5.  Payment  Procedure.    Payments  are  made  by  DFAS-PMJC/DE.    FSO  makes emergency  payment  of  amounts  accrued  to  date  from  date  of  death,  upon  corroboration  of need by the base CAR, and only after receiving DFAS-PMJC/DE authorization. 876 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 54.6.6.  Documentation.    Upon  notification  of  an  active  duty  member's  death,  FSO coordinates with the CAR to contact the surviving dependent and explain this allowance and the payment procedure.  If the  surviving  spouse  or  guardian  of  minor  dependents  signs  the SF 1174, and this spouse or minor child is the beneficiary for AOP, the signature on the SF 1174 is sufficient to claim the 365 days of BAQ and applicable housing allowances. 54.6.6.1.  CAR advises the claimant that he or she is responsible for reporting any address changes  to  DFAS-PMJC/DE,  6760  E.  Irvington  Pl,  Denver  CO  80279-3000,  to  ensure timely  receipt  of  payment.    Guardianship  papers  are  still  required  under  the  same conditions  as  required  for  death  gratuity  or  AOP.    DFAS-PMJC/DE  sends  a  letter explaining  the  pay  and  allowances  and  a  claim  statement  for  signature  to  dependents who will not receive AOP. 54.6.6.2.  FSO  submits,  to  DFAS-PMJC/DE,  documents  relating  to  the  deceased member  (for  example,  DD  Form  397  and  SF  1174).    Additional  information  may  be requested  to  determine  payment  amount.    (See  Chapter  26,  Chapter  30,  and      Chapter 31.) 54.7.  DFAS-DE Actions: 54.7.1.  Report of Settlement to DVA.  Upon DVA request, DFAS-PMJC/DE advises DVA of final settlement of pay accounts of deceased members. 54.7.2.  Adjustments.  If  unnegotiated  check  or  any  factors  affecting  pay  and  allowances  are discovered after  AOP  payment has  been made  or after the appropriate documents  have  been submitted  to  DFAS-DE,  inform  DFAS-DE  of  facts  by  phone  and  follow  up  with  a  case  in CMS, including documents and letter of explanation.  DFAS-DE makes required adjustments. 54.7.3.  DFAS-DE  Collection  Actions.  DFAS-DE  will  take  action  to  recover  erroneous payment. When these procedures have been followed and there is no lack of good faith or due care, the FSO who made the erroneous payment may apply for relief under DoDFMR, Vol 5. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 877  Figure 54.1.

Federal Taxable Wages. 56.2.1.  Military  pays  are  taxable  wages  as  defined  by  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  44, table  44-1.  MGIB  contributions  are  a  reduction  to  Federal  taxable  wages  (see paragraph 64.3.2).  All debts remaining at time of separation are included in Federal taxable wages  and  reported  on  TD  Form  W-2,  Wage  and  Tax  Statement.  When  DFAS  receives collections  after  separation,  Debt  and  Claims  issues  a  DFAS-DE  Form  705,  Certificate  for Income Tax Adjustment, to the member. 56.2.2.  Taxable  wages  are  reported  in  the  year  wages  are  received,  either  actually  or constructively.  Constructive  receipt  occurs  only  when  there  is  not  a  substantial  limitation on the member's right to receive the payment at issue. For example, a member is entitled to a bonus  payment  with  a  November2006  authorization  date.  The  entitlement  posts  to  the member's  MMPA  in  November  2006  and  is available  for  payment  to  the  member,  but  the member  does  not  accept  the  bonus  payment  until  January  2007.  The  bonus  payment  is taxable  in  2006  since  the  wages  were  constructively  received  in  2006.  For  additional guidance, contact AFAFO. 56.3.  TD Form  W-4, Employee's  Withholding  Allowance Certificate.  The  FSO,  where the member  first  reports  for  duty,  must  require  each  member  to  accomplish  a  TD  Form  W-4, Employee’s  Withholding  Allowance  Certificate,  and  DD  Form  2058,  State  of  Legal  Residence Certificate, as  part of in-processing. The  member may  submit a  new TD  Form  W-4 and/or DD Form 2058 when his or her  tax  status  changes. Information reflected on the TD Form W-4 and DD  Form  2058  is  used  to  establish  or  change  FITW  (W-4)  or  SITW  (DD  2058)  data  and withholding  factors  on  a  member’s  MMPA.  See  Figure  56.1  The  original  documents  are forwarded  to  the  Federal  Records  Center  with  the  DTL  (see  Chapter  2  of  this  manual  for document  submission  requirements),  a  copy  is  retained  with  the  extra  copy  of  the  DTL,  and another copy is provided to the member. 56.3.1.  Input Transactions.  Based on the TD Form W-4, input an FJ04 transaction with the federal  withholding  factors.   See  Figure  56.14  for  transaction  layout, and  field  input edits.  Each  transaction  includes  marital  status,  number  of  allowances,  additional  amount  of withholding, and exemption from withholding, if applicable.   The  fields  not  being  changed in the FJ04 transaction will contain blank spaces.  Multiple items can be changed with input of one FJ04 transaction. 56.3.2.  Exemption  from Withholding.   When a  member  submits a TD Form  W-4 claiming exemption from income tax withholding, advise the member that he or she must have had no 888 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 tax  liability  in  the  previous  year,  and  anticipate  no  tax  liability  in  the  current  year.    The exemption  is  only  valid  for  the  current  calendar  year.    If,  during  the  year,  a  member determines  that he  or  she  will  have a tax liability in the  current  year, a new TD  Form W-4 claiming a valid  marital status and number  of allowances, must  be  submitted.  If a  member determines that he/she will not have a tax liability in the next calendar year, a new TD Form W-4  must  be  submitted  after  December  1st  of  the  current  year,  but  no  later  than  February mid-month of the next calendar year.  If a new TD Form W-4 is not submitted, and the FJ04 transaction  has  not  processed  by  February  month  end  restructure,  FITW  will  resume  in March  at  the  withholding  rate  of  single  with  zero  exemptions.    NOTE:    DJMS  stops withholding  for regular  wages  only;  withholding  on  one-time  entitlements  continues.  For a manual refund of withholding from one-time entitlements, send a message to DFAS. 56.3.3.  If the tax-auth-city-state is 098, at the time the E203 processes, the FSO will receive a UDN reject, as a result of the MPF processing, to notify the FSO that member must declare a legal  residence  and  an  MG  transaction  must  be  sent  to  DFAS-DE.  A  60-day  suspense  is established  for  receipt  of  the  MG  transaction.  At  the  end  of  60  days,  the  FSO  receives another UDN from the suspense transaction and a new 30-day suspense is established.  If the 30-day suspense is not cleared, it is rejected to DFAS for follow-up action. 56.4.  Responsibility for TD Form W-4 Information. 56.4.1.  Central Site.   DFAS is required  to  submit information  to  the IRS  when  so  directed, via  written  notice  or in  future published guidance.  Additionally, DFAS  may  be required to withhold income tax at a higher rate if notified to do so by the IRS. 56.4.1.1.  DELETED. 56.4.1.2.  (DELETED). 56.4.2.  FSO.  The  FSO  must  honor  a  member's  TD  Form  W-4  submission,  unless  the  IRS gives  written  notification  specifically  stating that a  member is not  entitled to  claim  exempt status or is not entitled to the number of withholding allowances claimed on the TD Form W-4. 56.4.2.1.  When  a  written  notice  is  received  from  the  IRS  (IRS  Letter  XXXX  (SC)) specifying that the  member  is  not  entitled  to  claim  exemption  from  FITW,  or  that  the number  of  allowances  claimed  is  excessive,  the  FSO  must  comply  with  the  IRS determination letter. 56.4.2.1.1.  The FSO processes an FJ04 transaction in the month of receipt to update member’s MMPA in accordance with the IRS letter.  This is the only exception that authorizes  the  FSO  to  change  the  federal  withholding  factors  without  a  signed  TD Form  W-4  from  the  member.    After  processing  the  FJ04  transaction,  forward  the original IRS  determination letter to the DFRC  with  the DTL, retain a copy  with  the file  copy DTL, and  send a  copy to the  member.   Any  determination letters  from the IRS which are sent directly to DFAS will be forwarded to the member's FSO (active duty only) for action. 56.4.2.1.2.  If, after receipt  of the  determination  letter, the  member  brings  in a  more current  determination  letter  authorizing  a  larger  number  of  exemptions  or  exempt status, the FSO must honor the new determination letter, and take action to update the AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 889   member’s  MMPA  accordingly.  No  FITW  refunds  will  be  given  for  the  period  of lower allowances or non-exempt status. 56.4.2.2.  If  a  member,  who  has  received  a  determination  letter,  submits  a  statement justifying  a  newly  filed  TD  Form  W-4  for  more  withholding  allowances  than  the number  found  on  the  IRS  Letter  XXXX  (SC),  send  the  new  TD  Form  W-4,  the justification  statement,  and  a  copy  of  the  determination  letter  to  your  local  IRS  office.  Overseas bases should send the new TD Form W-4 and statement to: Director, Office of International Operation 1325 K Street NW  Washington DC 20225  56.5.  Federal Income Tax Withholding (FITW). 56.5.1.  FITW  is  normally  computed  using  member’s  Federal  wages  and  DJMS  on-line Table  073.  See  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  44,  for  additional  guidance.    One-time entitlements are taxed at the federal flat rate percentage. 56.5.2.  The  FITW  deduction  amount  for  retroactive  pay  entitlements,  as  the  result  of  a retroactive accession only, should be computed using the following FITW formula:     NM-FITW-DED  X  FITW Quotient Factor  =  CM-FITW-DED NOTE:  FITW Quotient Factor = CM-FITW-WAGES/NM-FITW-WAGES 56.5.2.1.  If  the  FITW  quotient  factor  is  less  than  one,  compute  current  month  FITW using DJMS on-line Table 073. 56.5.2.2.  If  the  FITW  quotient  factor  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  one,  compute  current month FITW using the formula in paragraph 56.5.2 above. 56.5.3.  The  following  is  an  example  of  FITW  Tax  Computation  for  Retroactive  Pay Entitlements using the FITW Quotient Factor. 56.5.3.1.  Compute based on the following: 56.5.3.1.1.  Member’s normal Basic Pay (BP) is $874.80 per month. 56.5.3.1.2.  Member claims single with one (1) exemption for tax purposes. 56.5.3.1.3.  Member  entered  active  duty  January  16,  1996.  Accession  processed August  1996.  Member’s  current  month  FITW  wages  are  $6,561.00  (BP  for period  January  16  through  August 31, 1996).  This amount  is  substituted into CM-FITW-WAGES field of the FITW Quotient Factor formula.  $6561.00 / NM-FITW-WAGES  =  FITW Quotient Factor 890 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 56.5.3.2.  Solution: 56.5.3.2.1.  Divide  current  month  FITW  wages  by  next  month  FITW  wages  to arrive at  the FITW  quotient  factor (substituted into  NM-FITW-WAGES  field  of the FITW  formula  as  an  interim  measure  to  demonstrate  procedure  for  the  calculation.  The results of this step is what will actually be used in the calculation as the quotient factor). $6561.00 / $874.80  =  7.5 (FITW Quotient Factor)          NOTE:  The FITW quotient factor is two decimal places in length; do not round the decimal up or down. Example:  1.029 should be 1.02. NM-FITW-DEDTN  X  7.5  =  CM-FITW-DEDTN  56.5.3.2.2.  Using  the  information  given  above,  compute  next  month  FITW deduction  (BP  of $874.80  and  exemptions  of  S01  for  tax  purposes).   Next  months FITW  deduction  is  $66.50  (substituted  into  NM-FITW-DEDTN  field  of  the  FITW formula).  $66.50  X  7.5 =  CM-FITW-DEDTN  56.5.3.2.3.  Completing the  FITW  formula,  member’s  current  month  FITW deduction  would  be  $498.75  (substituted  into  the  CM-FITW-DEDTN  field  of  the FITW formula). $66.50  X  7.5  =  $498.75   56.6.  Adjustments and Refunds. 56.6.1.  Adjustments. Adjustments to a member’s taxable wages and/or withholdings can only be processed by DFAS-JM/DE. The FSO  must establish a CMS  case and refer it to the Tax Box,  providing  as  much  specific  information  as  possible  to  substantiate  the  adjustment. Reference subparagraph 56.6.1.1 below for appropriate office to be contacted. 56.6.1.1.  Current  Year  Federal  Taxable  Wages  and/or  Withholdings.  Contact  the appropriate  DFAS-DE  office  to  correct  current  year  Federal  taxable  wages  and/or withholdings,  as  applicable.  DFAS-JMSB/DE  is  responsible  for  adjusting  taxable wages  and  withholdings  for  active  duty  members  ("A"  status),  JMCBD  for  separated members ("T" and "V" status) without a debt, and DFAS-JEC/DE (Debt Establishment) for  members  who  separated  with  a  debt.  DFAS-JECC/DE  (Claims  Branch)  issues  TD Form W-2 on correction of record cases (BCMR). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 891  56.6.1.2.  Prior Year Federal Taxable Wages and/or Withholdings. A member's prior year Federal  taxable  wages  and/or  withholdings  may  only  be  corrected  by  DFAS-DE  if  an administrative  error  or  DJMS  system  error  resulted  in  the  wages  being  reported incorrectly  on  the  TD  Form  W-2  and/  or  MMPA.  In  this  situation,  the  FSO  contacts DFAS-DE, via CMS case, and requests issuance of a TD Form W-2C. 56.6.2.  Refunds. 56.6.2.1.  Prior  year  FITW  amounts  can  be  refunded  to  the  member  when  FITW  was erroneously reported to the IRS and the member did not receive any pay.  This normally occurs  when  a  member's  MMPA  is  in  suspended  (T)  status  and  wages  and withholdings  continue  to  accrue,  but  no money  is  released  to  the  member.   In  all  other cases, the member must file a tax return with the IRS to receive a refund. 56.6.2.2.  Contact DFAS-DE/FJP to refund the tax on one-time entitlements when a debt resulting  from  an  erroneous  payment  is  collected  in  one  lump  sum  during  the  same calendar year. 56.7.  TD Form  W-2,  Wage and Tax Statement.  DFAS-DE  produces TD Forms W-2  for all members who were on active duty during the calendar year, including members who separated or retired  during  the  year.    The  TD  Form  W-2  is  produced  and  mailed  each  January  for  the preceding calendar (tax) year (i.e., the 1994 TD Form W-2 is produced and mailed to members in January  1995).  TD  Forms  W-2  will  reflect  taxable  wages  and  withholdings  for  the  entire  tax year, even if the member had a break in service during the  year.   The  history  FID FC,  FE,  FH, FJ  and  FK  entries  with  W2-ISSUED  field  =  'YES'  contain  the  wages,  withholdings,  and nontaxable income reported to the member on the TD Form W-2. 56.7.1.  Pension  Plan.    Per  IRS  directive,  members  on  active  duty  for  more  than  90 consecutive days at any time during the year (including mobilized Reserve Forces members) are covered by a qualified pension plan, and the pension plan block on the TD Form W-2 will be marked. 56.7.2.  Delayed Accessions.  A TD Form W-2 must be issued for a prior calendar year (1994) when a member enters active duty and receives payment in that year (1994), but the accession to DJMS is processed after December month-end restructure (MER) or in the following year (1995).  In this case, the TD Form  W-2 wages and  withholdings  must  be  based  on  when  the money  was  actually received  by  the  member.   If a  member  is a  delayed accession,  prepare and forward a pay computation (reflecting all entitlements and  withholdings used to arrive at  the  partial  payments  made  to  the  member)  to DFAS-DE/FJPA requesting issuance  of a TD Form W-2. 56.7.3.  TD  Forms  W-2C,  Statement  of  Corrected  Income  and  Tax  Amounts.  FSOs  do  not issue  original  TD  Forms  W-2C  for  Air  Force  members.  The  FSO  notifies  DFAS-DE,  via CMS,  and  requests  the  member's  account  be  corrected  when  it  is  believed  an  error  exists. DFAS-DE will research the account and process any necessary transactions. The history FID FC,  FH, FJ and FK (if applicable) entries  will  have  "W2C"  in  the  W2-ISSUED  field  after these  transactions  have  processed.  The  corrected  wage  and/or  deduction  amounts  are processed to the 5-Year Tax History system for the actual production of the corresponding TD Form W-2C. 892 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 56.7.4.  Duplicate  TD  Forms  W-2  and  W-2C.  Refer  to  the  "DJMS  FIVE  YEAR  TAX HISTORY  USERS  GUIDE  FOR  INQUIRIES  AND  REISSUES"  for  further  information concerning  the  issuance  of  TD  Forms  W-2C,  and  the  capability  to  process  reissues  of  TD Forms W-2 and any corresponding TD Forms W-2C for members. Requests for duplicate TD Forms W-2 and W-2C should be processed by the member's servicing FSO or by the nearest base  for  separatees  and  retirees.  Members  should retrieve  their  TD  Forms  W-2  and  W-2C from  myPay,  only  requesting  from  the  FSO  if  their  myPay  access  is  suspended  or terminated. 56.8.  Social Security Numbers (SSN).  SSNs are needed to properly credit individuals' accounts for  contributions  to  Federal  Insurance  Contributions  Act  (FICA),  which  will  cover  taxpayers under  the  Old-age,  Survivors  and  Disability  Insurance  (OASDI)  program  and  the  Medicare program.   Covered individuals may qualify for benefits after:  Obtaining the required number of quarters and age or becoming disabled or the death of the taxpayer.  The Medicare program may entitle  taxpayers  who  become  permanently  disabled  to  hospital  coverage.  After  January  1991, employers  are  required  to  deduct  and  report  Social  Security  and  Medicare  contributions separately.   Military  member ’s  participation  is required  by  DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 44 through 54. 56.8.1.  Requirement.    Each  member  on  active  duty  or  performing  active  duty  for  training must  have  an  SSN  (see  AFI  36-3203).    This  number  is  the  member's  service  identification number. 56.8.2.  Change  of  Name.  To  record  a  change  of  name  with  the  Social  Security Administration  (SSA),  the  member  submits  an  SS  Form  5,  Application  for  a  Social Security Number, to the nearest SSA office, if stateside, or MPF if stationed overseas. 56.8.3.  Social  Security  and  Medicare  Claims.    For  advice  and  assistance  regarding  Social Security and  Medicare benefits and  claims, use  facilities of the  nearest  social  security  field office except: 56.8.3.1.  National Capital Region.  Use facilities of Social Security Administration Field Office, 814 H Street NW, Washington DC 20203. 56.8.3.2.  Far  East.    Use  facilities  of  Social  Security  Administration  Field  Office, Federal Building, Civic Center, San Francisco CA 94102. 56.8.3.3.  Europe, Near and Middle East.  In Europe, the Near and Middle East, Eastern Canada,  Iceland,  and  Greenland,  use  facilities  of  Social  Security  Administration  Field Office, Post Office Building, Baltimore MD 21203. 56.8.3.4.  Caribbean,  Central,  and  South  America.  Use  facilities  of  Social  Security Administration Field Office, 34 South West First Street, Miami FL 33130, unless a social security field office has been established in the particular area. 56.9.  Social Security and Medicare Taxable Wages and Withholdings. 56.9.1.  Only basic pay is subject to Social Security and Medicare taxation and withholding. Also  see  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  44.    (MGIB  enrollment  reduces  the  basic  pay entitlement  during  the  contribution  period  and  wages  subject  to  FICA  and  Medicare accordingly.) AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 893  56.9.2.  DFAS-DE/FJP will correct or adjust a member's current year Social Security and/or Medicare taxable  wages and  withholdings.  Prior year taxable  wages  may  only  be  corrected by  DFAS-DE if  an administrative  or  DJMS  system  error  resulted  in  incorrect  reporting  of wages  on  the TD  Form W-2 and/or  MMPA.   In this  situation, the  FSO  contacts  DFAS-DE and requests issuance of a TD Form W-2C. Section 56B—Earned Income Credit. 56.10.  Entitlement Criteria. 56.10.1.  Earned  Income  Wage  Thresholds.    EIC  is  available  to  individuals  whose  earned income  and  adjusted  gross  income  are  below  the  earned  income  thresholds.  The  earned income and adjusted  gross income  threshold  varies,  depending  on  whether  the  member  has no  dependents,  one  qualifying  child,  or  two  or  more  qualifying  children.  The  thresholds change  each  year and  members  should refer to the TD  Form  W-5  to  determine  the  current threshold  for  their  income  and  status.    Members  can  use  the  Earned  Income  Worksheet  at Figure 56.6 to help determine whether or not they qualify. 56.10.2.  Earned  Income.    This  term  includes  all  taxable  items  of  pay  (i.e.  basic  pay  and special pay).  Because  of  the  effect  of  earned  income,  APEIC  is  only  available  to  members whose earned income does not exceed $29,665 for 2003.  Check the current year’s TD Form W-5 for annual limits. 56.11.  Advance Payment of Earned Income Credit (APEIC).  Earned Income  Credit (EIC) can  be paid  to  members  in  semi-monthly  or  monthly  increments  with  a  member's  normal  pay, once the member submits a TD Form W-5, Earned Income Credit Advance Payment Certificate, to the local FSO, and he or she is determined to  be  eligible.   See Figure 56.2.   The amount  of APEIC  is  determined  by  member's  earned  income  and  whether  a  member's  spouse  has  a  TD Form  W-5  in  effect.   A  member  whose  spouse  has a TD Form  W-5 in  effect  will  only  receive partial APEIC benefits while a member whose spouse does not have a TD Form W-5 in effect can receive full APEIC benefits. 56.12.  Eligibility  for  APEIC.  A  member  is  eligible  to  receive  APEIC  if  all  three  of  the following apply: 56.12.1.  Qualifying  Child.  Member  has  a  qualifying  child  living  with  him  or  her.  A qualifying child must meet the relationship, residency and age tests as stated on the TD Form W-5. 56.12.2.  Earned Income  Limit.   Member  expects  his or  her income to  not  equal  or  exceed the  earned  income  thresholds  (see  paragraph  56.14.1  below).    The  member's  spouse's income must also be considered when determining eligibility for requesting APEIC. 56.12.3.  Continuing Entitlement.  Member expects to be eligible to claim EIC for the current calendar year. 56.13.  Substantiating Documents.  Each eligible individual must complete a TD Form W-5. 56.14.  FSO Responsibilities. 56.14.1.  The  FSO  must  honor  a  member's  request  if  the  member  has  a  qualifying  child living with him or her, the member's pay plus nontaxable earned income are not expected to 894 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 equal or exceed the thresholds outlined on the TD Form W-5 (member's income includes any earned income provided by member's spouse) and the FSO is unaware of any other item that would  affect  a  member's  eligibility;  e.g.,  expected  receipt  of  bonus  payment,  loss  of dependents,  or PCS,  for a  period that  will exceed  six  months  of  the  tax  year,  to  a  location outside the  CONUS.  The  FSO  forwards the  original TD Form W-5 to DFRC and retains a copy  with  the  DTL.    Provide  a  copy  of  the  Earned  Income  Worksheet  to  members to  help them determine their eligibility. 56.14.2.  The FSO  processes a FID  FE  to  start,  stop,  cancel,  or change  APEIC.   See  Figure 56- 11 for transaction format. 56.14.2.1.  Start  (FE01).  The  transaction's  effective  date  can  be  up  to  one  processing month  in  the  future  (i.e.,  FE01  can  be  input  in  December's  processing  month  to  be effective the 1st of January of the next calendar year). 56.14.2.2.  Stop (FE02).  Processed against an FE with a current effective date and stops at month end.   To  change a member's  APEIC  from  full to partial  benefits  or  vice versa, an  FE02  must be processed followed by an FE01.  The  FE01 will  recycle until the first update  of  the  next  calendar  month,  which  may  not  be  the  first  update  of  the  next processing month. Section 56C—State Taxable Wages and Withholdings. 56.15.  State  Taxable  Wages.  Military  Pay  subject  to  Federal  tax  may  also  be  subject  to state  tax.  Attachment  15  is  a  listing  of  tax  information  for  each  state  and  territory.  Also  see DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 44. 56.15.1.  MGIB contributions reduce state taxable wages (see paragraph 64.3.2). 56.15.2.  All debts remaining at  time  of  separation  are  included  in  state  taxable  wages and reported on the TD Form W-2. 56.16.  State Income Tax Withholding (SITW).  State income taxes are withheld from the pay of members whose states of legal residence have formalized agreements with the United States Department of Treasury for state income tax withholding (SITW). 56.16.1.  The  amount  of  SITW  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  agreement  between  the Department of Treasury and the State.  Forms specifically prescribed by the agreement must be used (declaration of allowances, exemptions, exclusions, etc.). 56.16.2.  The  DoD  has  no  authority  to  withhold  delinquent  state  taxes.    DFAS-DE  notifies the states when a member changes state of legal residence.  Once a member changes his or her state of legal residence, SITW is not withheld for the prior state. 56.16.3.  DJMS  produces  an  undeclared  state  taxing  authority  report  twice  a  year,  in  April and November, which is placed out on SAR under mode JFATAX, report ID FA0141s.  It is very important to get these members’ state taxing authority updated; members who have an undeclared state taxing authority (state code 98) will encounter state tax filing issues at a later date.  In addition, the member’s MMPA will not convert to DIMHRS. 56.16.4.  Members whose state taxing authority is 99 are claiming to be residents of foreign countries.    If  the  tax-auth-state  in  the  accession  transaction  was  99,  contact  the  MPF  to AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 895  process the MH01 to identify the  member’s resident country.  Otherwise, process an MG04 to correct the tax-auth-state to a valid us state code.  See paragraph 56.18.2.3 for additional information. 56.17.  Responsibilities. 56.17.1.  Central  Site.    DFAS  will  correct  or  adjust  a  member's  current  year  state  taxable wages. Prior year state taxable wages  may only be corrected by DFAS if a DFAS system or administrative  error  resulted  in  incorrect  reporting  of  wages  on  the  TD  Form  W-2  and/or MMPA.  In  this  situation, the  FSO  contacts DFAS and requests  issuance of a TD Form W-2C.  (A  member's  failure  to  report  a  change  in  state  taxing  authorities  is  not  a  DFAS administrative error). 56.17.2.  FSO Responsibilities.  Based on the TD Form W-4, input an FK04 transaction with the state  withholding  factors.   See  figure 56-15  for transaction layout, and field input  edits.  Each  transaction  includes  marital  status,  number  of  allowances,  additional  amount  of withholding, and exemption from withholding, if applicable. 56.18.  Special  Provisions.  Other  member-requested  changes  that  affect  SITW  computation include: 56.18.1.  SITW  exemption  for  Native  American  military  members.    The  Soldiers’  and Sailors’ Civil Relief Act (SSCRA) prohibits states from taxing the military compensation of a Native  American  service  member  who  claims  a  tribal  reservation  as  his/her  residence  and who  earns  military  compensation  off  the  reservation  by  virtue  of  compliance  with  military orders.  In order to comply with the law, the member must be able to claim as his/her state of legal  residence/domicile,  a  federally  recognized  tribal  reservation  or  Indian  country.    In addition,  the  member  must  be  an  enrolled  member  of  that  federally  recognized  Native American tribe. 56.18.1.1.  Have the member complete a DD Form 2058-2 (see figure 56.21). 56.18.1.1.1.  (DELETED) 56.18.1.1.2.  (DELETED) 56.18.1.1.3.  (DELETED) 56.18.1.1.4.  (DELETED) 56.18.1.1.5.  (DELETED) 56.18.1.2.  Based  on  the  member’s  certification,  the  FSO  is  authorized  to  process  an FK04 with deduction election of ‘N’. 56.18.1.3.  You  are  not  required  to  verify  if  the  tribe/reservation  claimed  is  federally recognized. If  the  member  falsifies  this  information,  he/she  will  be  held  responsible  for state  taxes  by  the  state  at  the  time  of  income  tax  filing.    The  list  of  eligible tribes/reservations  can  be  found  at:  http://  www.access.gop.gov/.    Federal  Register/Vol 65,  No.  49/Monday,  March  13,  2000,  pages  13298  -13303.  Process  the  amended document in accordance with the requirements in this chapter. 56.18.1.4.  Withholding will stop in the processing month that the FSO submits the FK04 change to exemption status.  Adjustments for prior months will not be made. 896 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 56.18.2.  Declare or Change State of Legal Residency. 56.18.2.1.  New  members  must  declare  a  state  of  legal  residency  within  6  months  of accession,  using  DD  Form  2058,  State  of  Legal  Residence  Certificate,  unless  the  E103 transaction  included  this  information.    See  Figure  56-3.    This  form  is  also  used  for members who want to change their state of legal residence.  The DD Form 2058 is to be completed in triplicate. The  original is  forwarded to the DFRC  with the  DTL, a copy is retained with the file copy DTL, and a copy is provided to the member.  FSOs must input a MG04 transaction using the DD Form 2058 as their source document.  See Figure 56-20.    Valid  input  for  TAX-AUTH-CITY-STATE  is  ‘0’  followed  by  the  2  digit  numeric state code. 56.18.2.2.  The change is effective from the first calendar day of the processing month in which  the  MG04  transaction  is  processed.  State  taxing  authority  data  codes,  and administrator addresses are listed in Attachment 6.  A leave and earning statement (LES) remark is output in the month the MG04 transaction processes. 56.18.2.3.  When  the  MH  (Resident  Country)  entry  is  not  present  on  the  MMPA, and  the TAX-AUTH-STATE field in the MG04 transaction equals 99 (foreign nationals), the MG04 transaction  will recycle  for 10 updates.   If a resident  country add transaction has not processed in the next 10 updates, the recycling MG04 transaction will reject. 56.18.3.  Declaration of Exemption from State Withholding. 56.18.3.1.  Members  can  claim  exempt  from  state  income  tax  withholding  for  the following reasons: 56.18.3.1.1.  Members are residents of  states that  grant  exemption  based  on  specific residency requirements. 56.18.3.1.2.  Members  claim exempt  from  federal income tax  withholding, and  state claimed for legal residence parallels federal rules. 56.18.3.2.  Members must file a TD Form W-4 (both scenarios above), DD Form 2058-1, state income tax exemption test certificate (scenario #1 above), or specific state required form (if applicable).  See figures 56-1 and 56-8, respectively, for TD Form W-4 and DD Form 2058-1. Reference  paragraphs 56.19.1 through 56.19.6. 56.18.3.3.  State  taxable  wages  will  not  be  accumulated  on  member’s  MMPA,  reported on member’s TD Form W-2, or provided to the applicable state.  However, a listing will be  provided,  to  each  state,  of  members  who  claim  exempt.    Listing  will  include,  as  a minimum, the following items of information: 56.18.3.3.1.  Member’s SSN 56.18.3.3.2.  Member’s name 56.18.3.3.3.  Reason member claims exempt from withholding. 56.18.3.4.  Due  to  state  residency  requirements,  members  claiming  exemption  from SITW, who PCS into their state of legal residency (based on location of servicing FSO in LG  entry),  will  systematically  be  changed  to  SITW  deduction  election  single  (S)  with zero  (0)  exemptions.    The  member  must  submit  a  TD  Form  W-4  to  change  this  as applicable, and the FSO is to process the FK04 transaction.  However, the system will not AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 897  automatically  change  the  SITW  deduction  election  to  “N”  when  a  member  PCSs  from his/her state of legal residence. 56.18.4.  Status  Changes.    When  a  member’s  status  changes  to  ‘T’  for  any  reason,  next month  SITW  deductions  are  suspended  to  avoid  over  deduction  for  members  pending separation.  If a member is in ‘T’ status from more than one month, and returns to active duty, management  notice  U803  is  output  to  the  servicing  FSO  one  month  after  return  to  active duty.   Advise the member that additional SITW deducted for the remainder of the year may prevent under withholding penalties by the state. 56.18.5.  Filing  Requirement.    Military  members  are  responsible  for  filing  a  state  income tax return annually, regardless of where the member is stationed. 56.19.  Unique  State  and  Territory  Residency  Requirements.  The  following  states  and territories  have  unique  requirements  which  affect  military  members  who  are  legal  residents.  Active duty members with legal residence in these states declare rates, allowances or exclusions for SITW, as noted. 56.19.1.  Arizona. 56.19.1.1.  Arizona  Form  A-4,  Employee's  Withholding  Allowance  Certificate,  is  used when  a  member  changes  withholding  percentage.    Withholding  percentages  allowed  by Arizona are listed in Attachment 15. 56.19.1.2.  Effective  1  January  2007,  compensation  received  for  active  service  as  a member of the military (active duty, Reserve, or Guard), including combat zone excluded pay,  may  be  subtracted  when  computing  Arizona  adjusted  gross  income.  Additional information  on  treatment  of  military  income  can  be  found  in  Arizona  Department  of Revenue  Publication  704  (www.azdor.gov/brochure/704.pdf).  Questions  on  Arizona requirements  should  be  referred  to  the  Arizona  Department  of  Revenue.  Members  may contact the Arizona Department of Revenue at Arizona Department of Revenue Forms Distribution Unit 1600 West Monroe St.  Phoenix AZ 85007 or by phone at (602)542-4260. 56.19.1.2.1.  (DELETED). 56.19.1.2.2.  (DELETED). 56.19.2.  California, Idaho, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. 56.19.2.1.  Members  who claim  one  of  these  states as  their  state of legal residence, and are  stationed  outside  that  state,  can  claim  exemption  from  state  withholding  by submitting a DD Form 2058-1, or TD Form W-4. 56.19.2.2.  Withholding will automatically begin when a member is assigned to duty in one  of  these  states,  based  on  the  location  of  the  servicing  FSO  (ADSN  of  LG  entry). 898 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Members  may  elect  to  claim  exemption  and  stop  SITW  if  the  actual  duty  station  is located outside the state. 56.19.3.  Connecticut, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon. 56.19.3.1.  Members  who  believe  they  meet  the  three  criteria  below  may  declare themselves exempt from state withholding.  Members must: 56.19.3.1.1.  not maintain a permanent place of abode in the applicable state; 56.19.3.1.2.  have a permanent place of abode elsewhere; and 56.19.3.1.3.  have physically spent less than 31 days during the year in the applicable state. 56.19.3.2.  Members must submit the substantiating document applicable to each state as follows: -  CT-W4,  Employee's  Withholding  or  Exemption 56.19.3.2.1.  Connecticut Certificate.  The CT-W4 can be obtained by calling Connecticut Taxpayer Services at (806) 297-5962, or contacting them at the address provided in Attachment 5.  Form CT-W4  should  be  completed  so  that  the  correct  amount  of  income  tax  is  withheld.  Members  who  claim  exemption  from  tax  withholding  must  file  a  new  certificate for  the  following  year  on  or  before  February  15.  DJMS-AC  will  withhold  4.5% beginning February 16,  when a new  form CT-W4  is  not  filed by  members  claiming exemptions from withholding. 56.19.3.2.2.  Missouri  -  DOR  Form  374,  Statement  of  Non-residency,  or  MO Form  W4,  Employee's  Withholding  Allowance  Certificate.    Missouri  allows  the use  of  the DD  Form 2058-1, State Income Tax Exemption Test Certificate, in lieu of the DOR Form 374. 56.19.3.2.3.  New Jersey, New York, and Oregon - DD Form 2058-1. 56.19.4.  Guam.  DFAS-DE reports to the IRS on a quarterly basis the FITW amounts related to members  claiming  residency  in Guam.  The  FSOs  should verify  the information input in the MG and MH entries of members claiming residency in Guam to ensure these members are being  correctly reported. The MG entry  should  equal “99”, and the  MH  entry  should equal “GQ”. 56.19.5.  Ohio. Ohio Revised Code provides that for taxable years beginning on and after Jan 1, 2007, an Ohio resident member can deduct active duty military pay and allowances that are included in federal adjusted gross  income if those amounts are received  while  the  stationed outside  Ohio.  The  term "stationed"  refers  to  an  Ohio  resident  service  member’s  permanent place of military duty. Periods of training in which a service member, either individually or as  part  of  a  unit,  departs  the  permanent  place  of  duty  and  then  returns  following  the completion of the training, is not included in the definition of "stationed." Members who are legal residents of Ohio, but stationed outside Ohio, complete IT 4 MIL,  Military  Employee Exemption  from  Withholding.  This  form  allows  the  member  to  exempt  military  pay  and allowances received for active duty service while stationed outside the state of Ohio from the withholding  of  Ohio  income  and  Ohio  school  district  income  taxes.  To  qualify  for  the exemption,  the  military  member  must  complete  this  form  in  full,  sign  it  and  submit  it  to his/her  finance office. The form is available on the Ohio Department of Taxation website at: AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 899  http://tax.ohio.gov/documents/forms/ohio_individual/individual/2007/IT_IT4MIL.pdf (see Figure 56.7). Military pay and allowances for members who are Ohio residents stationed inside Ohio are subject to Ohio individual income tax and also to school district income tax if the member resides in a taxing school district. If a member is not eligible to claim exemption from Ohio income tax withholding, the member must complete Ohio form IT 4, available at tax.ohio.gov. Whether income is exempt from Ohio state withholding or not, Ohio residents are required to file Ohio state income tax returns. 56.19.5.1.  (DELETED). 56.19.5.1.1.  (DELETED). 56.19.5.1.2.  (DELETED). 56.19.5.1.3.  (DELETED). 56.19.5.2.  (DELETED). 56.19.5.3.  (DELETED). 56.19.6.  Puerto Rico. 56.19.6.1.  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Public Law no. 105-34, amended 5 U.S.C. § 5517  to  authorize  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  and  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto Rico  to  enter  into  a  tax  withholding  agreement.    The  agreement  was  executed November 17, 1997, and is effective January 1, 1998.   Military members who claim the Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  as  their  legal  residence  will  have  taxes  withheld  as follows: 56.19.6.1.1.  No  federal  income  tax,  only  Puerto  Rican  income  tax  withheld  as SITW, when duty station is outside the 50 states (us).  Tax will be computed based on tax rate table. 56.19.6.1.2.  Federal  income  tax,  with  no  SITW,  will  be  withheld  when  duty  station is within the U.S. 56.19.6.1.3.  Members  stationed  within  Puerto  Rico  will have  only SITW,  no FITW, deducted. 56.19.6.1.4.  All taxable  wages  will  be  reported  on  member’s TD  Form  W-2,  wage and tax statement, as both federal and state wages. 56.19.6.2.  Advise members, claiming residency in Puerto Rico, of the following: 56.19.6.2.1.  Member  must  file  both  a  federal  and  Puerto  Rico  income  tax  return  at the end of the year. 56.19.6.2.2.  Members  who  may  qualify  for  earned  income  credit  (EIC)  are eligible  for  advanced  payment  of  EIC  with  submission  of  a  TD  Form  W-5, Earned  Income  Credit  Advance  Payment  Certificate.    See  Figure  56.2  for  form sample. 56.19.6.2.3.  Advise members to contact the unit tax advisor or legal assistance office for further information or assistance. 900 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Section 56D—Combat Zone Tax Exclusion. 56.20.  Definitions. 56.20.1.  Combat  Zone  (CZ).    A  CZ  is  any  area  designated  by  Executive  Order  as  an  area in  which  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  are,  or  have,  engaged  in  combat.  Service  is performed  in  a  combat  zone  only  if  performed  on  or  after  the  date  designated  by  the Executive Order as  the  date  of the  commencing  of  combat  activities,  and  on  or  before  the termination  date  in  designated  zone.   DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 44, contains the areas currently considered CZs. 56.20.2.  Qualified  Hazardous  Duty  Area  (QHDA).    A  QHDA  is  a  military  Contingency Operation Area designated by Public Law to receive the same tax benefits as a CZ, with one major  difference.  In  order  for  a  QHDA  to  be  eligible  for  CZTE,  the  QHDA  must  be designated for entitlement to hostile fire/imminent danger pay (HF/IDP).  DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 10, provides the areas currently designated to receive HF/IDP entitlement. 56.20.3.  Direct Support.  Service is in direct support of military operations in a CZ or QHDA if  it  has  the  effect  of  maintaining,  upholding,  or  providing  assistance  for  those  involved  in military operations in the CZ  or QHDA.   Commander in Chief, Europe (CINCEUR),  is the approving  authority  for  all  European  theater  determinations  of  direct  support,  and  certifies which members qualify for tax relief by virtue of service in direct support of CZ, or QHDA operations  such  as  Operation  Joint  Endeavor,  Able  Sentry,  or  Provide  Comfort.    Service members and unit commanders, who are not in the CZ or QHDA,  may  not self-certify their entitlement  to  the  tax  relief.   Requests  must  be  processed  through the appropriate  chain  of command. 56.21.  Combat Zone Tax Exclusion (CZTE). 56.21.1.  A  CZ  does  not  require  the  HF/IDP  entitlement  to  receive  CZTE.  Per  DoDFMR Volume  7A,  chapter  44,  a  member  is  entitled  to  CZTE  for  any  month  during  any  part  in which: 56.21.1.1.  The member performs active service in an area designated by executive order as a CZ, or 56.21.1.2.  Provides  direct  support  of  military  operations  in  a  CZ,  and  is  entitled  to HF/IDP, or 56.21.1.3.  Performs active service with entitlement to HF/IDP in a QHDA, or 56.21.1.4.  Provides  direct  support  of  operations  in  the  QHDA  through  active  service performed  in  a  HF/IDP-designated  area  outside the  QHDA  (i.e.,  a  member maintaining  airplanes,  in  a  HF/ IDP-designated  area,  that  are  being  flown  over  the QHDA  in  support  of Operation Joint Endeavor). 56.21.2.  A  member  is  also  entitled  to  CZTE  for  direct  support  of  QHDA  operations  when the  member,  whose  permanent  duty  station  is  outside  the  QHDA  which  is  an  area  not HF/IDP-designated (i.e., Hungary  or  Italy),  and  flies  official  missions  into  the  air  space  of the QHDA.  This member's CZTE entitlement is based on entitlement to HF/IDP as a result of active service performed in QHDA air space in direct support of operations in the QHDA (i.e., Joint Endeavor). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 901  56.21.3.  A member is not entitled to CZTE for direct support of QHDA operations when the member,  who performs the aircraft maintenance  service in support of military operations in the QHDA,  is in an area  outside  the  QHDA  that  is  not  HF/IDP-designated  (i.e.,  Hungary, Italy).   CZTE  entitlement  for direct  support  of QHDA  operations is  conditional on HF/IDP entitlement.  The member is, however, entitled to an extension of the deadline for filing their federal income tax return when the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, certifies that such active  service  is  in  direct  support  of  operations  in  the  QHDA,  and  the  member's  orders reflect the direct support assignment. 56.21.4.  The  exclusion  amount  for  an  officer  is  limited  to  an  amount  equal  to  the  basic pay of the highest ranking enlisted member, plus IDP if applicable. DJMS Table 074 contains the amounts applicable  for  each  year.  Additionally,  officers  can  only  have  excluded  that portion  of  a  bonus  that  is between the monthly pay and the exclusion limit (cap). Example: An officer has regular taxable wages for May 07 of $4,000 and an ACP bonus of $100,000, with the first $50,000 due 1 May 07. This member is entitled to CZTE and IDP for the month of May 07. The exclusion for this member is limited to $6,687.60 for the month of May and future  installments  on  the  ACP  bonus  remain  taxable,  regardless  of  whether  paid  during  a month in  which the  member is  present in the  combat  zone. There is  no  exclusion  limit  for enlisted members.  NOTE:    Prior  to November 22, 1995, the  maximum amount  excludable for officers was $500.00. 56.22.  Substantiating  Documents.  The  documentation  required  for  a  member  to  be  entitled to CZTE will be one of the following: 56.22.1.  Member’s  orders  authorizing  them  to  enter  the  QHDA  (which  is  authorized HF/IDP), or a CZ.  See Figure 56.5. 56.22.2.  Travel  voucher  with  a  commander’s  certification  that  the  unit,  or  member,  has performed active duty service within a QHDA (which is authorized HF/IDP), or a CZ. 56.22.3.  Assignment to a unit that has been determined to be in direct support.   56.23.  CZTE Withholding Election. 56.23.1.  For  Enlisted  Members  and  Warrant  Officers.    The  CZ-DEDTN  field  in  the 23,  or CZ-DEDTCN field of the FL, transaction will contain “0” if CZTE is not authorized, and “1” if CZTE is authorized. 56.23.2.  For  Officers.    Officers  may  continue  all  or  part  of  their  FITW/SITW  while  in  a combat zone.  Officers requesting continuation of withholding must submit either a TD Form W-4, or a request indicating whether all, or part of the normal withholding should continue to be  deducted.  A  copy  of  the  request  (used  in  lieu  of  TD  Form  W-4)  authorizing  FSOs  to continue  withholding  should be  maintained  the  same as a TD Form W-4.   See  Figure 56-8.  The CZ-DEDTN field in the 23, or CZ-DEDTCN field of the FL, transaction will contain “0” if  CZTE  is  not  authorized.  Input  one  of  the  codes  indicated  in  Figure  56-9  if  CZTE  is authorized. 902 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 56.24.  CZTE  While  Hospitalized.  Members  are  entitled  to  CZTE  for  any  month  they  are hospitalized, or re-hospitalized, as a result of wounds, disease or injury incurred while serving in a CZ, or QHDA.  Use the FID FL to report their entitlement to CZTE. CZTE entitlement should be  documented  by  medical  opinion  from  a  military  physician  that  states  the  member's hospitalization is the result of wounds, disease or injury incurred while serving in a combat zone. FID  FL  must  be  reentered  each  month,  prior  to  month-end  restructure,  when  a  member’s hospitalization  covers  more  than  one  month.    See  Chapter  13  for  additional  information concerning CZTE entitlement for members wounded while on duty in a covered area. 56.25.  Leave Earned in a CZ or QHDA. 56.25.1.  The  value  of  leave  earned  in  the  CZ,  or  QHDA,  is  fully  excludable  from  taxable wages for enlisted members, and warrant officers, when used or sold, to the extent the leave was accrued during any month in any part of which the enlisted member actually served in a CZ or QHDA.  For officers, the value of leave earned during any month in any part of which they  served in the  CZ,  or QHDA,  may  be  excluded,  not  to  exceed  the  “maximum  enlisted amount” for the month of service to which the leave was earned, less the amount of wages already  excluded  for  that  month.    The  term  “maximum  enlisted  amount”  refers  to  the highest  amount  payable  to  the  highest  enlisted  grade,  plus  imminent  danger  pay,  if applicable. 56.25.2.  A  member  earns  2.5  days  leave  for  each  full  month  of  active  duty.    If  a  member serves any portion of a month in a CZ or QHDA, the leave earned during that month is subject to CZTE.  For any month a member is not eligible to earn the full 2.5 days, i.e., accession or separation  at  a  time  during  the  month  which  prevents  2.5  days  leave  being  earned,  the member  earns  .5  days  leave  for  every  six  days  on  active  duty.    If  a  member  serves  any portion  of  a  month  in  a  CZ  or  QHDA,  the  leave  earned  during  that  month  is  subject  to CZTE.  The amount of CZ  or QHDA tax  exempt leave available  for sale, or use, is reduced first as leave is sold or used.  For example, if the member accrues 30 days leave in the CZ or QHDA, and uses 30 days immediately upon return, the member will not have any leave that will  be  tax  excludable  when  leave  is  later  sold  or  used.   On  the  other  hand,  if  the  member only  uses  15  days  of  the  30  days  earned,  a  balance  of  15  days  will  exist,  and  must  be included first for any subsequent sell or use of leave. 56.25.3.  DJMS  currently  withholds  taxes  on  leave  as  it  is  used  or  sold.  The  FSO  notifies DFAS-DE,  via  CMS,  and  requests  an  adjustment  to  ensure  the  member  receives  the  tax benefit. No source document relative to this process is required to be submitted. 56.25.4.  The 23, BS, and FL entries on the MMPA are used to determine the validity of the adjustment requested.  The leave being sold, or used, must be verified to ensure it does in fact encompass  an  amount  of  leave  actually  earned  in  a  CZ  or  QHDA  that  has  not  previously been sold or used. 56.25.5.  The following results will occur from adjustments, as applicable: 56.25.5.1.  Adjustments  made  for  current  tax  year  cause  member’s  taxable  wages  and withholdings  to  be  corrected.    Changes  to  withholding  amounts  will  result  in  refund  as appropriate.  Member’s TD Form W2,  Wage and Tax statement, for current tax year will reflect adjusted amounts. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 903  56.25.5.2.  Adjustments made  for prior tax year(s) result in  member’s taxable  wages being adjusted, and  A TD Form  W2C,  corrected  wage and tax  statement,  being issued.  No  adjustment  will  be  made  to  amounts  withheld,  and  no  refunds  will  be  made.  Member must file an amended tax return to receive any refund due. 56.26.  LES Remarks for CZTE.  The  amount  of  CZTE  wages  a  member  earned  during  the calendar year will be displayed on the LES in March, June, September and December.  Members should be advised to review this information, and bring any discrepancies to the attention of the FSO.  CZTE wages are not included  in  taxable  income  on  a  member's  TD  Form  W-2  at  year end,  but  are  included  as  part  of  the  Non-Taxable  Earned  Income  reported  in  block  13.    If  a member  is  applying  for  the  earned  income  credit  (EIC),  the  amount  in  block  13  must  be included  in  "Earned  Income"  to  determine  the  amount  of  EIC  the  member  is  eligible  for  (See Section 56B - EARNED INCOME CREDIT). 56.27.  FSO Responsibility.  DJMS-AC processing will be as follows: 56.27.1.  When  a  member  is  in  a  CZ  or  QHDA  designated  for  HF/IDP  and  CZTE  IAW DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 10 and 44, respectively, the FID 23 transaction will be used to  start/report  entitlement.    See  Chapter  13  of  this  manual  for  further  specifics  regarding the input of FID 23 transactions. 56.27.2.  FID FL transaction(s) will be used when a member is performing extended official duty in an area entitled to CZTE,  but not  entitled to HF/IDP.  See Figure  56.16  and Figure 56.17 for transaction formats(s). 56.27.2.1.  Start  (FL01).  Transaction  will  be  used  when  member  is  authorized  a continuing  CZTE,  but  not  HF/IDP.    The  start  date  cannot  be  for  a  future  month,  just current or prior. 56.27.2.1.1.  Transactions  with  current  month and  year  effective  dates  will decrease federal  and  state  wages,  and  refund  applicable  federal  and  state  taxes  for current  month  only.  Decreased  amounts  will  be  reflected  in  the  FJ  and  FK  (if applicable)  entry(ies),  respectively,  on  the  MMPA  for  wages  and  withholdings.  Refunds  will  be  reflected  in  the  FID  P9  entry(ies)  with  PAY-DEDTN-TYPE  =  Z (federal), and = Y (state). 56.27.2.1.2.  Transactions  with  retroactive  effective  dates  of  prior  month,  current year,  will decrease  current  month and  year-to-date  federal and  state  wages, and  will refund federal and state taxes that were withheld for prior month(s) in addition to the actions discussed in paragraph 56.27.2.1.1 above. 56.27.2.1.3.  Transactions  with  retroactive  effective  date  of  prior  month,  prior  year, will  adjust  prior  year  federal  and  state  wages  in  addition  to  actions  discussed  in paragraphs 56.27.2.1.1 and 56.27.2.1.1.2 above.   No refund will be made of taxes previously  withheld.    TD  Form  W-2C,  Statement  of  Corrected  Income  and  Tax Amounts,  will be  generated  showing  change in  wages.    Member  must  file  amended tax return to receive any refund of prior year taxes withheld. 56.27.2.2.  Stop (FL02).  Transaction will be used  when member is  no longer entitled to CZTE.  Stop  date  must  be  prior  to  current  date.    When  stop  date  is  current  month, transaction will recycle until first calendar day of following month. 904 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 56.27.2.2.1.  Transactions  with  current  month and  year effective date  will  result  in a re-computation  of  current and  next  month's  federal, and  state  wage and  withholding amounts, if applicable.    Increased  amounts  will  be   reflected  in  the  FJ  and  FK (if  applicable)  entry(ies), respectively, on  the  MMPA  with  start = 7777 for  wages and withholdings. 56.27.2.2.2.  Transactions  with  retroactive  effective  date  of  prior  month,  current year,  will  re-compute  prior  and  current  month(s),  and  year  to  date  federal  and  state wages and withholdings.  Collection of federal and state taxes for prior month(s) will be reflected in P9 entry(ies) with negative dollar amounts in addition to the actions discussed in paragraph 56.27.2.1 above. 56.27.2.2.3.  Transactions  with  retroactive  effective  date  of  prior  month,  prior  year, will  adjust  prior  year  federal  and  state  wages  in  addition  to  actions  discussed  in paragraphs  56.27.2.2.1  and  56.27.2.2.2  above.    No  collection  of  taxes  will  occur.  TD  Form  W-2C,  Corrected  Wage  and  Tax  Statement,  will  be  generated  showing change  in  wages.    Member  must  file  amended  tax  return  to  reconcile  with  the Internal Revenue Service any prior year taxes owed. 56.27.2.3.  Report (FL03).  Used to report CZTE only when the member was in a CZ not designated to receive HF/IDP IAW DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 44.  Report CZTE for months indicated.  The  start and  stop  months must  be prior to the  current  month, or  the transaction will reject.  FL03 transactions processed for the current year will reduce year-to-date Federal and state taxable wages, and refund withholdings for the months indicated depending  on  the  CZ-DEDTCN  election  code.    When  input  for  prior  years,  prior  year Federal and state taxable wages will be adjusted if within IAS.  Otherwise, a management notice is sent to DFAS to adjust prior year Federal and state taxable wages.  A TD Form W-2C will be issued from the 5-Year Tax History system correcting taxable wages only.  Prior year withholdings are not adjusted. 56.27.2.4.  Correct (FL05).  Used to correct CZTE start or stop dates in an existing history FID FL entry.   FL05 transactions  for the  current  year  will adjust  Federal taxable  wages and  withholdings, and  state taxable  wages  depending  on CZ-DEDTCN  election.   When an  FL05  transaction  is  input  for  prior  years,  the  FID  FL  will  be  corrected  (if  within IAS),  Federal and  state  wages  will  be adjusted, and a TD Form W-2C will be created. 56.27.2.5.  Cancel  (FL06).    Used  to  cancel  previously  reported  CZTE  authorization.  When  canceling  an  FID  FL,  a  history  one-time  entitlement  FID  FJ  entry  is  created  to increase  year-to-date  Federal  taxable  wages  and    collect  current  year  Federal withholdi ngs  depending  on  the  CZ-DEDTCN  election.    These  entries  are  easily identified by the '7777' in the start date field.  A history one-time FID FK, similar to the one-time FID FJ, is built along with the FID FJ, if applicable.  When an FL06 transaction is input  for a prior year, the FL entry  will be canceled (if  within IAS), Federal and state wages  will  be  adjusted,  and  a  W-2C  will  be  created.  A  management  notice  is  sent  to DFAS-DE/FJP to adjust prior year Federal and state taxable wages if outside IAS. 56.27.3.  FSOs  are  required  to  ensure  processing  continuity  is  maintained.    If  CZTE  is initially  processed  with  HF/IDP  transactions,  i.e.,  2301  and  2303,  all  adjustments  to  that period  of  CZTE  authorization  must  be  processed  through  HF/IDP  transactions,  i.e.,  2302, 2305 and 2306. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 905  Figure 56.1.

General provisions and descriptions governing all allotments of pay  may be found  in  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapters  41  through  43.  The  minimum  monthly  amount  for allotments is $1 except  when there are  specific guidelines  elsewhere in this chapter.  Allotments should not be started to individual addresses, unless the member has obtained an individual waiver from his or her commander or the allotment is to an overseas country not serviced by the Overseas Military Banking Program.  All allotments should be started using the company code format with a company code obtained from Table 050.  DD Form 2558, Authorization to Start, Stop or Change an  Allotment  (Figure  57.1),  is  the  preferred  form  for  allotment  changes.  However  SF  1199A, Direct Deposit Sign-up Form (Figure  57.2); FMS  Form 2231, Faststart Direct Deposit (Figure 38.3); and DD Form 2762, Direct Deposit Authorization (Figure 38.3) may be used for allotments to financial institutions. 57.2.

Allotments are started for indefinite periods except for class C, F, and  T,  which are made for definite periods.  Starts (01) and increases (07) are effective first day of the current processing  month if  pay  due is  sufficient  to  pay allotment.  The servicing FSO must establish controls to ensure: 57.2.3.1.

If  input  with  an  April  or  May  start  date,  they  reject.    Class  F  Allotments must  remain  in  effect  at  least  3  months  and  the  monthly  amount  must  be  $1  or more.   The  total amount  pledged  must  be evenly divisible by the number of months of the allotment. 57.2.4.  Method  of  Payment.  Allotments  to  personal  savings  or  checking  accounts  are delivered via EFT.  Other allotments are sent in a blanket check (if an allottee receives multiple allotments). 57.2.5.  Restriction  on  Multiple  Allotments  to  Same  Allottee.    To  minimize  the  cost  to  the Government  in the administration  of  the  allotment  system,  only  one allotment  may be  sent to  an  allottee.   If the  member  wishes to  send  multiple  amounts  to  the  same  allottee,  or  the 932 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 same  financial  institution,  it  is  the  member’s  responsibility  to  work  with  the  institution  to transfer  funds  between the accounts at the institution.  Only one allotment for the total may be established. 57.2.6.  Member's  responsibilities.  When  allottee  is  a  bank  or  other  authorized  financial organization,  member  makes arrangements  with that  firm  to accept the  deposit to  member's account or to account of member's dependents before starting allotment.  Member must obtain account  number  or  policy  number.    Seven-character  company  codes  are  assigned  to  every financial  institution,  insurance  company,  government  agency,  credit  union,  etc.,  by  DFAS-DE.  If company is not listed on Table 50, see Chapter 60 for instructions. 57.2.7.  Allotments  to  Philippine  Addresses.    All  allotment  checks  destined  for  delivery  to Philippine  financial  organizations  or  individual addresses are  bulk  mailed by DFAS-DE  to DFAS-CL  (Cleveland).    DFAS-CL  delivers  all  checks  to  and  registers  each  with  the Philippine  postal  authorities.  Members  should  be  encouraged  to  have  all  allotments destined for the Philippines sent to a financial organization. 57.2.8.  Separated  Members  and  Veterans  Educational  Assistance  Program  (VEAP) Allotments.  For members who have a Class S VEAP allotment and are separating from the Air Force, the allotment will continue through the month of separation, if there is enough pay to cover the allotment. 57.2.9.  P7 Entry on MMPA.  The P7 entry on the MMPA contains the gross amount of pay available  to  allot  current  month  (CM)  and  next  month  (NM).    To  compute  net  amount available to allot CM, subtract the TOT-DEDN and TOT-ALOT in the P3 entry from the P7 entry.  To compute net amount available to allot NM, subtract the DEDTN-NM and ALOT-NM  in  the  P4  entry  from  the  P7  entry.  The  net  amount  should  be  computed  each  time  a member  wants  to  start  a  new  allotment  or  increase  an  existing  allotment.    If  there  is insufficient  pay  available  to  allot,  the  allotment  start  or  change  will  reject  ABU, "ALOTMTS EXCEED AUTHORIZED ALLOTTABLE INCOME." 57.2.10.  (DELETED). 57.3.  Source  of  Input.  Servicing  FSO  verifies  data  on  documents  presented  and  processes appropriate allotment transaction shown in Figure 57.4 through Figure 57.12. 57.4.  Substantiating Documents: 57.4.1.  Source  Documents.    Use  SF  1199A;  DD  Form  2558;  FMS  Form  2231,  DD  Form 2762; IRS Form 2159, Payroll Deduction Agreement, for Liquidation of Federal Tax through Payroll Deduction; Combined Federal Campaign pledge card; AF Form 1745; and AF Form 561 are the primary source documents used for allotments transactions. DD Form 2558, SF 1199A,  FMS  Form  2231,  and  DD  Form  2762  serve  as  Military  Pay  Orders  (MPO).    DD Forms  2558  may  be  issued  only  to  Air  Force  personnel,  FSOs,  Army  Emergency  Relief, Navy Relief, Navy Relief Society, Air Force Aid Society, and American Red Cross (see DoD Directive  7330.1).  These  documents  require  an  original  member’s  signature.  Documents cannot  be  mailed  to  finance  by  commercial  companies.  The  only  exceptions  to  this requirement are receipt  of  fax  documents, as  discussed  in  paragraph 2-4B  of this  manual, and privatized housing companies. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 933  57.4.2.  Preparation and Distribution: 57.4.2.1.  Preparation.  Member completes DD Form 2558 and signs after verifying data.  Members wanting to increase, decrease, or stop an allotment amount mark the appropriate block  in  Section  I.    There  is  no  prohibition  to  placing  FSO  remarks  by  the  Change Block  to  note  the  action  indicators  of  the  DJMS  input  transactions.    The  increase  (07) and  decrease  (08)  action  indicators  are  valid  for  input  transactions  of  applicable allotments. 57.4.2.2.  Allotment  stops  requested  by  the  allottee  do  not  require  a  DD  Form  2558 signed by the member or allottee.  The allottee’s request for a stop (letter, message, etc.,) or the return of funds to DFAS-DE serves as supporting documentation for the allotment stop. 57.4.2.3.  Distribution: 57.4.2.3.1.

This  form can be found at http://www.fms.treas.gov.  Ensure sections 1 through 5 are completed.  It is suggested that a check/share-draft be attached by the member so the FSO can verify the correct routing indicator and account number have been entered on the form. can be found on or 57.4.4.  DD  Form  2762,  Direct  Deposit  Authorization  Form,  may  be  used  for  allotments  if the  member  is  sending  the  allotment  to  an  existing  account  at  a  financial  institution.    This form at HTTP://WEB1.WHS.OSD.MIL/ICDHOME/DDEFORMS.HTM.  Ensure  sections  1,  2, and  3  of  this  form  are  completed.    It  is  suggested  that  a  check/share  draft  be attached by the  member  so  the  FSO  can  verify  the  correct  routing  indicator  and  account  number  have been entered on the form. DFAS web site the 57.5.  Allotment  Flash  Codes.  When  separation  transactions  E-3,  E-4,  or  E-5  update member's MMPA file, and allotments are in effect, the transactions produce flash codes 4 or 5 in the AZ area of the MMPA. Flash  code 4 (separations) is  set  the  first update  of  the  pay period 934 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 in which the member is  separating. Flash code 5 (retirement) is set on the 10th of the month in which the member is retiring.  Once the flash code is set, all allotment transactions will reject. 57.6.  Undeliverable  Allotments.  Allotments  returned  to  DFAS-DE  by  the  allottee,  the United  States Postal Service or financial institution are: 57.6.1.  Re-mailed to a correct address  provided  by the allottee  or  member as  shown on the MMPA  (see  Chapter  7,  paragraph  7.13  for  an  explanation  of  a  clean-up  of  allotment addresses done on a quarterly basis); or 57.6.2.  Reissued to the correct allottee based on data provided by the allottee or member; or 57.6.3.  Canceled.  DFAS-DE cancels the allotment payment, stops the allotment, and advises the servicing FSO of the action taken.  The FSO will notify the member within 1 working day and advise the member that the allotment: 57.6.3.1.  Was returned as undeliverable by the post office or unpostable by the financial institution. 57.6.3.2.  Was refunded into the allotter's pay. 57.6.3.3.  Was stopped by DFAS-DE to preclude the return of subsequent allotments. 57.6.3.4.  Should  be  restarted  with  a  correct  allottee  address  prior  to  end  of  month  cut-off (if so desired by the member). 57.7.  Payment to Allottees.  All allottees receiving more than 25 allotments of pay must receive payment either via EFT or by blanket check.  No individual checks will be sent.  All new company codes established will be established as blanket recipients if they are unable to receive EFT (not a financial institution).  Advise members that if the potential allottee refuses to accept blanket checks or EFT, the allotment will be stopped and other arrangements for payment are required. 57.8.  Use  of  Company  Codes.  If no existing  company  code  can  be  found  for an allottee and the allottee is  other  than an individual, request a  company  code  from DFAS-JMPBA/DE, using CMS. 57.9.  Discretionary Allotments: 57.9.1.  Number.  Each member  is allowed up to 6  discretionary allotments  for any  purpose desired by the member (unless the use of the allotment violates laws in that state).  In addition to the 6 discretionary allotments, eligible individuals may have 1 allotment to VEAP.  Those members  with  more  than  6  discretionary  allotments  on  the  implementation  date  of  this policy  (April  1992)  were  grandfathered  and  allowed  to  continue  the  allotments  already  in existence.  However, any change to any one of the existing allotments is construed as a stop and  no  new  allotment  may  be  started  until  the  total  number  of  discretionary  allotments reaches six or below. 57.9.2.  Characteristics.  Discretionary  allotments  make  up  those  allotments  formerly characterized  as  dependent  support,  savings,  insurance,  and  home  mortgage.    While systematic  edits  prevent  processing  more  than  2  savings  allotments  or  1  home  mortgage allotment(s), members wishing to have additional allotments to  financial  institutions or to pay  mortgages  may  do  so  using  the  FID  AD.    If  allotment  is  for  insurance  purposes, process  as  a  class  I  allotment  and  if  for  rent  or  mortgage  payments, process as a Class H unless  the  member  already  has  one  class  H  in  effect.  In  that  case,  process  the  second  or AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 935  subsequent allotments for that purpose as D allotments.  All allotments destined for personal checking  or  savings  accounts  at  financial  institutions  should  be  processed  as  D  allotments using SF 1199a. 57.10.  Non-Discretionary Allotments: 57.10.1.  Number.    There  is  no  limit  on  the  number  of  non-discretionary  allotments  a member  may  have.    The  system  currently  limits  the  total  number  of  all  allotments (discretionary plus non-discretionary) to 15. 57.10.2.  Characteristics.  Non-discretionary  allotments  are  those  for  the  purchase  of  bonds, charitable  contributions  to  Air  Force  Aid  Society,  Air  Force  Assistance  Fund,  Combined Federal  Campaign,  loan  repayment  for  government  debts  or  those  insured  by  the government,  or  contributions  to  the  Veterans  Educational  Assistance  Program  (VEAP).  These are identified as class B, C, F, T or S (only to company code S9999963) allotments. 57.11.  Retired Pay Allotments.  Retirees are limited to allotments as outlined in the DoDFMR Vol  7B.  Review  existing  allotments  during  pre-retirement  counseling  and  advise  member  that any existing allotments which do not qualify for transfer to retired pay must be stopped. 57.11.1.  Qualifying allotments include: 57.11.1.1.  No more than six discretionary allotments.  These include but are not limited to:    Payment  of  insurance  premiums  for  various  types  of  commercial  insurance, voluntary  payment  to  a  dependent  or  relative,  deposit  to  a  financial  institution,  mutual fund company, investment firm, and payment of a car loan, mortgage or rent, or a loan to repay consumer credit. 57.11.1.2.  Non-discretionary  allotments  limited  to  the  following:  purchase  of  US Savings  Bonds,  voluntary  liquidation  of  indebtedness  to  the  US  payment  of delinquent  federal,  state  or  local  income  taxes,  charitable  contributions  to  Air  Force assistance fund. 57.11.2.  In  addition  to  allotments  authorized  above,  any  other  allotments  (except  class  C) in  effect  during  last  month  of  active  service  may  be  continued  into  retirement  to  assist personnel in transition from active to retired status. 57.11.3.  All allotments identified as D, H, I, S, and T allotments are paid from retired pay if there  is  enough  retired  pay  to  cover  the  amount  of  allotment  deduction  (I  and  S  type allotments are  converted  by  retired  pay  to  D  allotments).   After  separation,  any  change  to the allotments must be submitted through Defense Retiree/Annuitant Pay System (DRAS). 57.11.3.1.  Any  allotments  to  be  carried  forward  to  retired  pay  system  must  be  started, stopped or changed before mid-month cutoff in the month of retirement. 57.11.3.2.  In  the  event  changes  to  allotments  are  requested  after  this  time,  have  the member complete an authorized allotment or bond form, as appropriate; suspense action until  a  DRAS  record  has  been  created  (usually  about  the  10th  of  the  first  month  of retirement); then input the transactions into DRAS. 57.11.4.  If  the  member  attempts  to  start  or  change  an  allotment  in  DJMS  and  the transaction  rejects  before  mid-month  cutoff,  follow  procedures  in  57.11.3.2  above  to  start or change the allotment in DRAS. 936 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 57.11.5.  After retirement,  nonstandard  forms or  personal  letters  may  be  used  to  support  an allotment  request,  change,  or  cancellation  provided  all  needed  information  is  furnished and the request has been signed by the retiree. 57.11.5.1.  In extenuating circumstances  when you are not able to process  the allotment start  or change directly into DRAS, mail the completed form or letter, along with a letter of explanation to DFAS-CL (code ROA), 1240 E 9th  Street, Cleveland OH 44197-9800 and request their assistance completing the member’s request. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 937  Figure 57.1.

Air Force members on extended active duty may purchase US Savings Bonds through payroll deduction using the allotment  system.  Bonds  may  be  mailed to any address in the United States and authorized foreign addresses or held in safekeeping. 58.2.  Source of Input.  The FSO starts, stops or makes changes to E & I bond allotments at the member’s  request  using  authorized  forms.   Effective  1  May  2003,  Form  SB-2378, Authorization  for  Purchase and Requests for Change United States Series EE Savings Bonds or United  States  Series  I  (Inflation-Indexed)  Savings  Bonds,  is  the  authorized  form  to  use  (Figure  58.1).   All  prior  forms  may  be  used  until  stock  is depleted.    These  forms  include  the DD  Form  2559  (Figure  58.2);  Form  SBD  2104,  Authorization  for  Purchase  and  Request  for Change,  Unites  States  EE  Savings  Bonds  (Figure  58.3);  or  effective  1  April  2000  through  30  April  2003,  Form  SB  2305,  Authorization  for  Purchase  and  Request  for  Change,  United States  Savings  Bonds  Series  I  (Figure  58.4).  Bond  addresses  may  also  be  changed  using  AF Form 1745. Bond allotments appear on the MMPA as FID AB. 58.3.  Characteristics of Bond Allotments: 58.3.1.  Bond  Series.  There  are  two  types  of  US  Savings  Bonds  available  through  payroll deduction. 58.3.1.1.  US  Savings  Bonds  (Series  EE)  has  a  purchase  price  one-half  the  maturity value  of  the  Bond.    The  series  EE  Bonds  available  through  payroll  deduction  are  $100,  $200,  $500,  or  $1000.  The  Series  EE  Bond  is  identified  by  a  “T”  in  the  Bond-Series-Code. 58.3.1.2.  US Savings Bonds (Series  I) are inflation-indexed  Bonds.  The  Series I Bonds deal  with  par  value  securities.    This  means  they  are  purchased  at  face  value.    Their special  features  are  a  fixed  base  interest  rate  and  a  supplemental  rate  adjusted  for inflation.    Treasury  announces  earnings  rates  for  Series  I  and  EE  Bonds  on  May  1  and November  1  of  each  year.  The  purchase  prices  available  through  payroll  deduction  are $50, $75, $100, $200, and $500, and $1000.  The $5000 and $10,000 Series I Bonds are not  available  through  payroll  deduction.    The  series  I  is  identified  by  and  “I”  in  the  Bond-Series-Code. 58.3.2.  Effective  Date.  Class  B  allotments  are  started  for  indefinite  periods.  Starts  (AB01) are effective on the first day of current processing month.  If the transaction is received after mid-month cutoff and pay  due at  end  of  month (EOM) is not  enough  to  pay the allotment, the  transaction  is  rejected.  Changes  are  effective  the  first  day  of  the  processing  month  in which received.   Stops are  effective  the  month  contained in the input transaction.  This  date may  be  either  the  current  processing  month  or  the  month  prior.    Amounts  due  toward purchase of an unissued bond will be refunded to the member. 58.3.3.  Names,  SSN  and  Addresses  on  Bonds.    Member  may  name  another  person  as owner,  co-owner,  and/or  beneficiary,  but  may  not  name  a  judiciary,  private  or  public organization.    It  is  not  necessary  that  member's  name  be  on  the  bond  as  owner,  co-owner 956 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 or  beneficiary.   When  owner  is  other  than  member,  that  person's  SSN  must  be  placed  in proper  field  of  input  transaction.    When  co-owner,  or  beneficiary,  is  other  than  member, that  person's  SSN  should  be  placed  in  proper  field  of  input  transaction,  if  available; otherwise, place zeros in the field.  Members should be encouraged to have bonds mailed to a  permanent  address,  one  not  expected  to  change  upon  reassignment.  If  member  is  owner, he/she may elect to have bonds held in electronic safekeeping storage at DFAS.  No address is required on the start or change transaction for members electing the safekeeping option. 58.3.3.1.  When bonds are held in safekeeping, member may request bond status and also obtain any or all bonds upon written request.  Members may fax in their written requests for release  of  bonds  held  in  safekeeping  to  DFAS-IN,  Disbursing  Operations/JFD,  DSN 699-4339, commercial 317-510-4339.  Fax  must  include,  bond  owner  name,  SSN, address  to  which  the  bonds  should  be  mailed,  and  a  phone  number  in  case  there  are questions,  and  the  request  must  be  signed.  Written  requests  may  also  be  mailed  to:   DFAS-IN,  Disbursing  Operations/JFD,  8899  E.  56th  Street,  Indianapolis,  IN  46249. Questions  may  also  be  directed  to  DFAS-IN  Disbursing  Operations  at  commercial  317-510-8539. 58.3.3.2.  Bonds are not held in safekeeping for members who are retired or separated. 58.3.4.  Changes of Address.  If a bond recipient changes the mailing address for a bond, the member completes either DD Form 2559 or SBD 2104 if only bond addresses are changing, or  AF  Form 1745 if personal  mailing address or LES address also changes.   FSO uses FID AA04 to change the address  of  all  classes  of  allotments  of  that  individual.   If  the  member has  more  than  one  bond  mailed  to  an individual and only wishes to change the address for one bond, two transactions (AB02) and a start are required.   Be  sure  the  stop  has  processed before the start transaction is processed (see Chapter 7, paragraph 7.13 for an explanation of a clean-up of bond addresses done on a quarterly basis).  Do not use an AA04 transaction for  bonds  held  in  safekeeping  at  DFAS  since  an  AA04  changes  only  mailing  address,  not bond disposition code. 58.3.5.  Returned  Bonds.    Bonds  returned  to  DFAS-DE  as  undeliverable  are  sent  to  the member's servicing FSO for delivery to the member after a new address has been obtained to prevent the return of future bonds.  The FSO must: 58.3.5.1.  Deliver  bond  to  the  member  and  obtain  an  address  change.    FSO  should encourage the member to have bonds sent to a permanent mailing address not expected to change upon reassignment. 58.3.5.2.  Advise member that  bonds owned by the  member  may  be held in safekeeping at DFAS.  Process necessary transactions  to  change  bond  disposition  code  if  member  so chooses. 58.3.5.3.  Forward the bond to the member's new servicing FSO if he or she is no longer serviced  by  your  office.    Annotate  the  listing  to  that  effect  and  return  it  to  DFAS-ATDT/DEDE, 6760 E. Irvington Place, Denver, CO 80279-3000. 58.3.6.  Inquiries: 58.3.6.1.

Description.  Deductions for Armed Forces Retirement Home (AFRH) apply to airmen and warrant officers  serving  in  the  Regular  Air  Force.   See  the  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  for  amount of deduction and requirements. 59.2.  Deduction: 59.2.1.  Establishment.    AFRH  is  driven  by  event  processing  only.    The  deduction  is established  by  accession  processing  for  regular  Air  Force  members  (service  component  of R).    The  deduction  starts  automatically  effective  the  month  of  the  date  of  entry  on  active duty.   No other input transaction is required. 59.2.2.  Amount Changes.  Secretaries of the Army and Air Force may change the deduction amount if recommended by the Board of Commissioners of the home.  The current monthly deduction amount is $.50.  DFAS-DE makes the change and advises FSOs when a mass-rate change is directed. 59.2.3.  Discontinuance.  Deductions are suspended when the service member is in a non-pay status in excess of thirty days or when in excess leave status.  The deduction is stopped only upon separation from active duty.  No other input transaction is required.              AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 975  Chapter 60 COMPANY CODES AND OTHER TABLES 60.1.  Description.

Table  50  is  a  file  of  the  names,  addresses,  and company  codes  for  banks,  credit  unions,  insurance  companies,  and  other  miscellaneous companies.  Table 50 is available for viewing via an on-line inquiry.   Miscellaneous companies include:   mortgage  companies  and  other  miscellaneous  financial organizations that  can receive allotments.  Banks,  savings  banks,  and  savings  and  loan  associations,  or  federal  or  state chartered  credit  unions  are  the  only  financial  organizations  authorized  to  receive  a  member's paycheck (FID LH). 60.3.1.  Missing  Companies.    If  no  company  code  is  listed  on  Table  50  for  a  particular company, please use one of the following options for requests: 60.3.1.1.  Send  a  message  to    CD  E-MILPAY.TABLES@DFAS.MIL  (plea se  note  that ECCS.MAIL/EMC2/TAO is no longer available); or 60.3.1.2.

Company  codes  may  not  be  assigned  to  branch  banks  or  multiple  addresses  for the same insurance company.  All monies disbursed by DFAS-DE must be sent to the parent bank or home of the company. 60.3.3.  Table 50  Codes.   There are two  codes  that  identify  the  method  of  transfer  of  funds for paychecks and allotments.  They are: 60.3.3.1.  Paycheck Type: CODE EXPLANATION A D H Composite check to financial organization Individual check to financial organization Data transferred through electronic fund transfer system (EFTS) 60.3.3.2.  Allotment Recipient Type: CODE EXPLANATION 3 6 7 9 Company receives a blanket check and detail listing Company receives individual checks Company receives allotment payments via EFTS Company receives a blanket check and detail on a magnetic tape 60.3.4.  Net  Pay and/or  Allotment Class and Company Code Prefix.  Financial  organizations may have more than  one company  code.   For  example, Bank of  USA, New York, NY,  may receive  net  pay,  as  well  as  allotments  and,  therefore,  has  two  company  codes  on   Table  50,  1234567  and  S456789.  1234567  has  a  paycheck  type/allotment  recipient  type of  H7  indicating  it  is  a  bank  on  EFTS  while S456789 has an allotment recipient type  of 6 indicating it is a bank receiving individual checks.  Since only  net  pay  and  allotments  may be  sent  via  EFTS,  1234567  is  used  for  these  purposes,  while  S456789  is  used  for  T allotments to Bank of USA.  Use general guidelines in Table 60.1. 60.3.5.  Failure  to  use  appropriate  company  codes  results  in  delayed  posting  to  members' accounts at financial organizations, etc., and may cause the member to pay additional interest, late charges, penalties, or a combination of these, unnecessarily.  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 977   Figure 60.1.

Description.  The  Family  Member  Dental  Plan  (FMDP)  is  a  Congressionally  mandated program established to provide dental insurance for eligible dependents of active duty members of  the  uniformed  services.    Procedures  covering  deductions  and  eligibility  criteria  are  in DoDFMR, Volume 7A, Chapter 54. 61.2.  Source  of  Input:  Effective  February  1,  2001,  United  Concordia  Companies,  Inc. (UCCI)  is  the  contracted  provider  for  Tricare  Dental.  UCCI  processes  all  collections  via  AI allotment.  There is no FSO input.   UCCI handles all rejects or inquiries related to the program.  Instruct active  Air  Force  military members to call UCCI at 1-800-866-8499 with any questions or for new enrollments.  UCCI web site is www.ucci.com. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 983  Chapter 62 SAVINGS DEPOSIT PROGRAM (SDP) 62.1.  Description.  Depositors  must  meet  eligibility  criteria  contained  in  DoDFMR,  Volume 7A,  chapter 51.  Members entitled to participate in the program may deposit not more than their "unalloted  current  pay  and  allowances"  (as  defined  in  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  51)  in amounts of $5 or more, in multiples of $5, with any disbursing officer or other designated officer of a uniformed service. 62.2.  Substantiating Documents.  For cash or check collections for Air Force members only, a DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, is prepared.   For a collection via allotment, complete a DD Form 2558, Authorization to Start, Stop or Change an Allotment. 62.3.  Responsibilities.  FSO processes SDP collections into DJMS.  The  collection information is  passed  by  DFAS-DE  to  DFAS-Cleveland  Center  (DFAS-CL).  DFAS-CL  maintains  SDP records  for  members  of  all  the  services,  calculates  interest,  and  makes  refund  and  interest payments to the members. 62.4.  FSO Actions.  Process collections as follows: 62.4.1.  Collections  From  Air  Force  Members  Paid  on  the  Defense  Joint  Military  System (DJMS)  -  Active  Component.    Prepare  a  DD  Form  1131,  citing  57*3500  510  or  530, 525725 and assign a CP voucher number.   Indicate "SDP" in the description column and the  date  of  deposit  in  the  "Date  Received  Subject  to  Collection"  block  and  in  the  "Date Received" column of the DD Form 1131.  If member pays by check the check will be made payable to the DAO. 62.4.1.1.  Mail  a  legible  copy  of  the  DD  1131  to  DFAS-PMJSAA/DE  or  fax  to  (303) 676-6486, DSN 926-6486. 62.4.1.2.  Input  a  C2  and  C9  into  DJMS  with  the  date  of  deposit  in  voucher  date  field.  For  example:  Agent  office  collects  SDP  funds  on  23  March  1991.  The  DD  1131  is vouchered  by  the  parent  on  3  April  1991.    The  C2  and  C9  transaction  must  show  23 March 1991. 62.4.1.3.  Ensure  that  a  DS01  transaction  is  input  into  DJMS  before  the  C2,  using company  code  D386751,  indebtedness  type  V.    For  the  DS  transaction,  the  amount  of specific  indebtedness  must  equal  the  C2  amount  and  the  amount  of  monthly deduction  must be less than the collection amount.   For  example, C2 amount  is $100, the DS must reflect amount of specific debt of $100 and a monthly deduction of $50 (or any  amount  less  than  $100).    This  allows  the  C2  to  close  the  DS  entry.    Failure  to follow  these  procedures  will result  in the DS  closing immediately against available net pay and the C2 will reject due to no open DS entry. 62.4.1.4.  To process allotments, have member complete a DD Form 2558.  In block 10 of the  DD  Form  2558,  check  "Other"  and  specify  "SDP"  in  the  remarks  block.    For  AF members, input as a type "S" using company code 9999955. 62.4.2.  Processing  Deposits  Made  By  Members  of  Other  Services.

When an eligible member has an SDP account and member is discharged or separated overseas (not for reentry into the Service), all deposits plus interest will be repaid upon member's request following discharge or separation from the service. NOTE:  Members  serving  in  the  eligible  area  who  are  discharged  and  immediately reenlist, extend their enlistments, or who are discharged to accept a commission, may not withdraw their deposits. 62.5.2.2.3.  When  an  eligible  member  has  an  SDP  account  and  member  is  in  a missing status, all deposits, plus interest, will be repaid upon direction of the Secretary concerned or designee. 62.5.2.2.4.  When  an  eligible  member  who  has  a  savings  deposit  account  dies,  all deposits,  plus  interest,  will  be  repaid  upon  settlement  of  member's  unpaid  pay  and allowances as provided in DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 36.  62.5.3.  Procedures for making withdrawals: 62.5.3.1.  Emergency  withdrawals.    Withdrawals  may  be  made  only  in  an  emergency when  the  health  or  welfare  of  a  member  or  dependent(s)  would  be  jeopardized  if  the withdrawal  were  not  granted.    Emergency  withdrawals  may  be  authorized  by  the member's commanding officer. 62.5.3.1.1.  Member  must  submit  a  written  application  for  emergency  withdrawal  to his or her commander  specifying  the  reason  for  the  emergency  withdrawal and the amount  of  money  needed  as  well  as  information  on  where  the  payment  should  be sent. 62.5.3.1.2.  The  commander  must  be  assured  of  the  validity  of  the  reason  for  the emergency  withdrawal request.   Based  on those  findings,  the request is approved  or disapproved.    If  disapproved,  commander  returns  the  request  to  the  member.    If approved,  it  is  forwarded  to  FSO  or  agent  who  submits  the  request  to  DFAS-CL.  Include,  SSN,  branch  of  service,  identify  the  account  as  Persian  Gulf  (PG)  or Operation  Joint  Endeavor  (OJE),  and  amount  requested  (either a  specific amount or  the  balance  in  the  account).  Provide  payment  delivery  information  including account number, type of account (checking or savings) and the routing transit number (RTN  Number)  from  Table  50  (if  EFT).    Also  indicate  that  this  is  an  emergency request and that the request has been approved by the member's commander.  The EFT method of payment is strongly encouraged to avoid non-receipt or lost or stolen paper checks. NOTE:  Before preparing a withdrawal request, check the member's MMPA to ensure the DS and C2 for the SDP deposit are on the member's record.  If not, take steps  to  get  the  deposit  on  the  member's  record  before  processing  the  request.    If necessary,  contact  the  FSO  (or  agent)  who  collected  the  money  and  request  the SDP  deposit  be  processed.  Unless  the  SDP  deposit  shows  up  on  the  member's  pay record, the member cannot withdraw. 62.5.3.1.3.  In extreme emergencies where the money is needed by the member at the military site, contact DFAS-CL to determine if the money is available.  If so, pay the member  locally,  citing  accounting  classification  57X6010  S380100.    Send  payment AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 987  information via fax, letter, or message to DFAS-CL.

Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance (SGLI) is described in the DoDFMR Volume 7A,  chapter  47.   Coverage  amounts  and  the  resulting  premiums  change  periodically.  The  most  recent  change  was  effective  1  September  2005,  when  Public  Law  109-13,  changed 38  USC  Section  1967,  to  increase  maximum  coverage  from  $250,000  to  $400,000  for  all members.  SGLI coverage is available in $50,000 increments up to the maximum of $400,000.  The  monthly premium  deduction is at a rate  of $3.25 for each $50,000 of coverage ($3.25 for $50,000,  $6.50  for  $100,000,  $9.75  for  $150,000,  $13.00  for  $200,000,  $16.25  for  $250,000, $19.50 for $300,000, $22.75 for $350.000 and $26.00 for $400.000). 63.1.1.  Under  certain  conditions,  member's  spouse  or  next  of  kin  will  be  notified  if  the member elects to decline, cancel or reduce SGLI coverage.  The spouse will also be notified if coverage is designated for other than the member's current lawful spouse or their children. 63.1.2.  Members  who  elect to  be  insured  for less than the  maximum  coverage amount,  or elect  to  decline  coverage  entirely,  must  complete  Form  SGLV  8286,  Servicemember’s Group Life Insurance  Election  and  Certificate.    For  more  information  and  to  obtain  Form SGLV 8286 visit  www.insurance.va.gov. 63.2.  Traumatic  Injury.  Public  law  109-13  also  added  a  rider  to  the  existing  SGLI  statute, effective  1  December  2005.    Each  service  member  that  is  insured  under  SGLI  and  suffers  a loss  from  a  traumatic  injury  is  eligible  to  receive  monetary  compensation  for  a  total  amount not  less  than  $25,000  and  not  greater than $100,000.   All  members  with  SGLI  coverage  must be  covered  under  T-SGLI.    An  additional  cost  of  $1.00  will  be  added  to  the  SGLI  premium deduction  each  month.    Members  cannot  decline  traumatic  SGLI  unless  they  decline  SGLI coverage.    If  the  amount  of  coverage  for  SGLI  is  reduced  by  the  member to a lower  option, a flat rate of $1.00 will still be assessed to the amount of the SGLI premium. 63.2.1.  T-SGLI  payments  are  for  members  who  sustain  traumatic  injuries,  such  as  the  loss of a limb or eyesight.  The payment amount will be determined by OSGLI. 63.2.2.  Traumatic  injury  coverage  will  not  affect  entitlement  to  compensation  or  pension benefits.  Traumatic  injury  coverage  provides  money  for  a  loss  due  to  a  specific  traumatic event while disability compensation is intended to provide ongoing financial support to make up  for  the  loss  in  income-earning  potential  due  to  service-connected  injuries.    Traumatic injury  coverage  is  not  designed  to  serve  as  an  income  replacement  program  but  rather provides a payment to assist service members and their families through the injury recovery period. 63.2.3.  T-SGLI  coverage  will  stop  at  midnight  on  the  date  of  member’s  separation  from the uniformed service. 63.3.  Source of Input: 63.3.1.  The  accession  transaction  automatically  establishes  maximum  coverage  for  all members accessed into the Air Force through DJMS. 990 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 63.3.2.  The  MPF  maintaining  member's  personnel  records  prepares  all  input  transactions, including changing SGLI options, and transmits direct to DFAS-DE.   MPF input adds, stops or changes SGLI deduction on member's MMPA.  Processed transactions appear in section 6 of daily transaction register (DTR) for servicing FSO. 63.4.  Pay  Status.  SGLI  coverage  and  deductions  are  not  stopped  while  a  member  is  in  an excess-leave  status  without  pay  and  allowances.    DFAS-DE  collects  accumulated  deductions when  member  returns  to  normal  duty  status.    Coverage  continues  for  31  days  of  AWOL  or confinement  status.    SGLI  coverage  starts  automatically  upon  return  to  duty  from  AWOL  or desertion status.  DFAS-DE stops SGLI when a member is separated. 63.5.  Family  SGLI.  Effective  1  November  2001,  Title  38,  United  States  Code,  allows  for family coverage under Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI). 63.5.1.  The  Family  SGLI  program  provides  coverage  for  the  spouse  and  all  children  of members having SGLI coverage.  Every member who has a SGLI option  of other than zero (0),  will  automatically  receive  coverage  under  the  new  program  for  his/her  spouse  and children,  unless  the  member  reduces or declines coverage using  VA Form  8286a.  Payment will  be  made  via  payroll  deduction.  The  deduction  for  the  spouse’s  coverage  will automatically  start at the $100,000 coverage level.  Exception:  the spouse's  coverage  level cannot  exceed  the  member’s  coverage  level.    For  example;  if  a  member  elected  regular SGLI coverage of $50,000, the spouse’s coverage would be limited to $50,000.  See Figure 63.3  for  amounts  of  Family  SGLI  premiums.    Children  will  be  covered  at  the  maximum coverage  of  $10,000  and  there  is  no  premium  charged  for  the  children’s  coverage.  The Family SGLI premiums are  determined by the  spouse’s  birthday;  if  the  spouse’s  birthday is  incorrect  in  DEERS,  incorrect  premium  amounts  will  be  collected.    If  member  is  not registered in DEERS, the premiums for  spousal  coverage are  still  due and  will  be  collected retroactively  upon  registration  into  DEERS.  Any  changes  in  the  member’s  family  status, such  as  a  divorce  or  the  death  of  a  spouse,  needs  to  be updated in DEERS in order to stop premium collection.  A premium is due for the month of discharge/ separation. 63.5.2.  Member married to member:  a military member married to another military member is  eligible  for  Family  SGLI  coverage.    Members  who  are  married  to  other  military members  are  covered  under  family  SGLI  even  if  they  haven’t  registered  their  spouse  in DEERS;  a  debt  will  accrue  for  each  month and retroactively be  collected  upon  registration into DEERS. 63.5.2.1.  Collection will begin effective the later of:  the date member is accessed in the service,  date  of  marriage,  or  the  date  of  implementation  of  family  SGLI  (November 2001).    Example:  member  was  accessed  in  1999  and  married  to  a  military  member  in September  2003.    Member  didn’t  update  DEERS  with  the  date  of  marriage  until  July 2004.   A retro debt  for  family SGLI, from  September 2003 through the  month  prior to current  month,  will  be  processed  and  a  DB01 transaction,  effective  current  month,  will be  input  to  start  the  member’s  family  SGLI  deduction.  The  member’s  military  spouse will also be assessed a  debt for the  same timeframe,  processed in the same way.   Using the  same  dates,  if  both  members  decline  family  SGLI  in  September,  2003,  the  same month as the marriage, no debt will be accessed.  If the members fail to decline coverage by filing a SGLV 8286a, a debt will be assessed. 63.5.2.2.  The point of contact for Family SGLI questions is the MPF. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 991  63.5.3.  Source of Input.  The automatic deduction (FID DB) is started by input source 3740, Defense  Manpower  Data  Center  (DMDC),  based  on  information  obtained  from  Defense Enrollment  Eligibility  Reporting  System  (DEERS).  The  member’s  MPF  is  responsible  for maintaining the FSGLI documentation and providing that information to DEERS. 63.5.3.1.  Transactions  for  FSGLI  are  accepted  from  3740  (DMDC)  and  Central  Site.  The  DB01  (start),  DB02  (stop),  DB04  (change),  and  DB06  (cancel)  are  the  valid transactions. 63.5.3.2.  Reject codes for FSGLI (to help you research problems):  ZOA:  SGLI-OPTNS (FAMILY)  INVALID-MUST  EQUAL  1-9,  A,  or  space.    ZOB:    SGLI  AGE  OPTION  - MUST  EQUAL  SPACE  WHEN  SGLI-OPTN  EQUAL  SPACE.    ZOX:    FSGLI IMPLEMENTED  6  November  -  ZOX  rejects  occur  when  the  transaction  is  attempted with an effective date prior to implementation. 63.5.4.  Pay Status.  See paragraph 63.4 above.

General.  There  are  two  educational  benefit  programs  that  require  contributions  from members, these are: 64.1.1.  Veteran’s Educational Assistance Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Montgomery G.I. Bill (MGIB). 64.1.2.  Veteran’s Educational Assistance Program (VEAP). 64.2.  Montgomery  G.  I.  Bill  (MGIB).  The  MGIB  was  established  as  a  contributory educational  assistance  program  available  to  individuals  who  first  enter  active  duty  on  or  after July 1, 1985.   Individuals electing to participate in the program will have their basic pay reduced by  $100  per  month  for  12  months  usually  beginning  the  month  after  graduation  from  basic training  or  officer training  school.   The decision  to  decline  enrollment  or  enroll  is  irrevocable and  is  made  within the  first 14  days  of active  duty.   The reduction  may  only  be  made  for  full months'  of  active  duty--no  reduction  is  made  for  the  month  of  separation  or  the  month  of accession.  Specific  details  are  contained  in  38  United  States  Code  Chapter  30.  See  paragraph 64.9 for information on the Montgomery G.I. Bill $600 contribution program. 64.3.  Source  of  Input.  Pay reductions are  processed as a  by-product  of the  personnel  system (MILPDS). MILPDS  uses  the  election  on  DD  Form  2366,  Montgomery  G  I  Bill,  to  determine the member's enrollment status. For enrolled members, a DE transaction flows from MILPDS to DJMS-AC and is posted to the member’s master military pay account (MMPA) as a DE entry. 64.4.  Alternate  Enrollment  Programs.  In  specific  instances,  individuals  may  elect  to  enroll in  MGIB  prior to  separation under  special  programs.   Messages  will  be issued  with procedural instructions for collection of the $1200 under these special programs.  Individuals separating involuntarily  under  force reduction programs (Transition  Assistance  Management Program  for instance)  are  qualified  to  make  cash  contributions  to  MGIB  to  either  transfer  eligibility  from the  Veterans  Educational  Assistance  Program (VEAP) or to negate their original disenrollment in  MGIB.    Additionally,  those  separating  under  the  VSI  or  SSB  program  may  also  contribute $1200 prior to separation for MGIB enrollment. 64.4.1.  Eligible  individuals  must  elect  to  participate  at  the  local  education  office  on  DD Form 2366 prior to separation 64.4.2.  MGIB  contribution  of $1200 must  be  made  prior to  separation.   A  cash  collection may  be made to collect the entire balance due at separation under the following conditions:  If a DE entry is present, it will remain open until the pay record converts to a separated (V) status.  Therefore,  a  C203  transaction  is  processed  to  post  the  cash  collection  against  the  DE  entry.  NOTE:    Since  the  amount  in  the  deduction  to  date  (DETD  field)  in  the  DE entry  includes  the  current  month  deduction,  the  cash  contribution  must  be  computed  by subtracting the amount in the DETD field from $1200 and then adding in the current month deduction (DEDB).   For  example,  the DETD  in the DE entry is  $300.  In order to  pay the entire balance due, the cash collection would have to be for $1,000.  996    AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007  $1,200.00   -  300.00      900.00   + 100.00 $1,000.00 (includes current month deduction) (current month deduction) 64.4.2.1.  If  there  is  no  DE  entry  present,  local  finance  offices  make  two  PQ  payments for  final  separation  pay  -  one  for  $1,200  payable  to  DFAS-JD/DE  and  the  remainder to  the  member.  If  insufficient  final  separation  payment  exists  to  make  the  $1,200 payment,  the  member  must  bring  cash,  cashier’s  check,  or  a  money  order  payable  to the  local  finance  office  for  forwarding  to  DFAS-JD/DE.  These  collections  must  be accompanied  by  the  proper  collection  voucher  and include a  statement identifying  the collection as specifically for Montgomery G I Bill. Once the pay record has converted to a  separated  "V"  status  the  DE  and  C2  entries  must  be  posted  by  central  site  (see paragraph 64.6). 64.4.3.  Forward the Treasury check (for PQ payments) for $1200, payable to the DFAS-DE Disbursing  Officer,  showing  the  member’s  name,  SSN,  and  MGIB  contribution.    Submit  AF Form 1209 with the following information: 64.4.3.1.  Member's Name, SSN and Rank 64.4.3.2.  Member's date of entry on active duty (EAD) 64.4.3.3.  Member's date of separation (DOS) 64.4.3.4.  Name of special program member is separating under (VSI, SSB, TAMPS) and separation program designator code (SPD) from the E5 transaction or DD Form 214 64.4.3.5.  Date of the Treasury Check and Check Number 64.4.3.6.  Point of Contact including name and phone number 64.4.3.7.  Mail  check  and  AF  1209  to:  DFAS-JD/DE  PO  Box  200030  Denver  CO  80220-0030 64.5.  Effect  on  Taxable  Wages.  MGIB  is  a  reduction  of  entitlement  to  basic  pay,  not  a deduction  from  pay,  under  the  provisions  of  the  law.    As  such,  amounts  contributed  are  not subject  to  federal  or  state  income  tax  withholding  and  year  to  date  wages  are  reduced accordingly.    In  cases of administrative  error  where  pay  was  erroneously  reduced,  the  amount refunded  to  the  member  is  subject  to  federal  and  state  income  tax  withholding  when  the refund  is  made.    Example:    Member  disenrolled  but  pay  reduction  started  9402  and continued through 9407  for a total of  $600.  Taxable  wages  were  reduced  by  $600. When the refund is made in 9408, taxable wages will be increased $600 and the net received by the member will  be  approximately  $400-475  depending  on  the  number  of  exemptions  and  state  of  legal residence claimed. 64.6.  FSO Responsibility.  The base education office is the office of primary responsibility for all MGIB questions, including those  concerning reductions of  pay.  The FSO does  not have the capability  to  start,  stop,  cancel,  or  change  the  MGIB  reduction  since  all  pay  affecting  actions AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 997  relating  to  MGIB  are  done  through  the  personnel  system.    However,  the  FSO  should  be familiar  with  the  DE  MMPA  entry  and  be  able  to  validate  the  MGIB  reduction’s  effect  on taxable  wages.  All  questions  pertaining  to  benefits  and  eligibility  must  be  referred  to  the education  office.   Establish  a  CMS  case  when  the  member  claims non-receipt of MGIB, or VEAP deductions/refunds and refer to DFAS AC MGIB. 64.7.  Central Site Responsibility. 64.7.1.  Cash collection made for MGIB reductions prior to separation will be posted on the MMPA  by  DFAS-PMJSAA/DE.  If  the  member's  pay  record  is  in  a  suspended  ("T")  status when  the  collection  is  received,  a  DE01  transaction  for  the  entire  $1,200  and  a  C203 transaction  to  report  the  cash  contribution  can  be  processed.    DFAS-PMJSAA/DE  also ensures that  proper documentation is  forwarded to  the  respective  areas  tasked  with  making taxable wage adjustments. 64.7.2.  In  the  event  cash  contributions  are  made  and  there  are  insufficient  wages  year-to-date  to  be  adjusted  by  the  amount  of  the  contribution,  central  site  reviews  the UH099C204  (MGIB/Taxable  Wage  Review)  report.   This  report  is  run  at  the  end  of  each quarter  to  allow  the  processing  lines  to  review  taxable  wages  and  to  make  manual adjustments, as required, prior to the issuance of W-2 forms at year end. 64.7.3.  The  monthly  reduction  amount  is  limited,  by  law,  to  $100.    Central  site  has  the capability  to  change  the  monthly MGIB reduction amount in  the unlikely  event an amount other than $100 was initially established. 64.7.4.  Education  offices  have DFAS-PMJSAA/DE  also  has  the  ability  to  cancel  the  MGIB,  but  will  only  do  so  upon request and when provided with a copy of DD Form 2366 showing the member had declined enrollment. the  MGIB cancel reduction.    the ability to 64.8.  Veteran’s  Educational  Assistance  Program  (VEAP).  Members  wishing  to  contribute to  VEAP  may do so through use of a class S allotment to company code 9999963, which may pay through their last month of active duty.  The FSOs and GUSs brief  members  on  enrollment and  disenrollment  procedures  for  VEAP.  They  also  stock  and  distribute  VA  Forms  5281, Application for Refund of Educational Contributions.  The following conditions apply: 64.8.1.  Member’s  entry  date  must  be  equal  to  or  greater  than  1  Jan  1977  and  less  than  1 Jul 1985. 64.8.2.  Eligible  members  must  have  been  initially  enrolled  in  VEAP  before  1  Apr  87. Members who have made contributions through lump-sum contributions or allotments at any time  between  January1977  (7701)  and  March  1987  (8703)  are  considered  enrolled  even  if they have received a refund or do not have an active allotment on 1 Apr 87.  Those members who  have  made  no  contributions  either  by lump  sum  or allotment before 1 Apr 87 may  not enroll. 64.8.3.  Allotment must be in amounts of $25 or $100 in increments of $5. 64.8.4.  Use only the following action indicators for class S VEAP allotments: 64.8.4.1.  Start - 01. 64.8.4.2.  Increase amount - 07. 998 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 64.8.4.3.  Decrease amount - 08. 64.8.4.4.  Stop - 02. 64.8.5.  Lump-sum contributions to VEAP for members enrolled before 1 Apr 1987 may be made in the  maximum  amount  of $2,700, representing  monthly amounts of $25  to $100 in increments  of $5. The lump  sum may  cover a retroactive period  of active  duty service or a period into the future.  Steps for making lump-sum contributions are: 64.8.5.1.  Lump-sum contributions may be in the form of a money order, cashier’s check or Treasury check payable to DFAS-PMJSAA/DE.  No personal checks may be accepted. 64.8.5.2.  Member  completes  DD  Form  2558  as  shown  in  Figure  64.1.    FSO  must ensure  the  remarks  block  contains  the  amount  of  the  lump  sum  contribution,  the distribution  instructions  (including  exact  months  if  member  has  been  advised  deposits must  cover  specific  months  by  the  education  officer  or  VA),  and  the  check  or  money order number. 64.8.5.3.  Forward deposit and DD Form 2558 to:     DFAS-IN Disbursing Operations/JFD  8899 E. 56th Street Indianapolis, IN  46249   64.8.5.4.  FSO advises members: 64.8.5.4.1.  They may request a refund of their VEAP contributions and resubmit the contributions in a lump sum before member’s date of separation. 64.8.5.4.2.  Monthly  allotment  contributions  may  continue  to  be  made  until  the maximum of $2,700 has been reached. 64.8.5.5.  FSO advises members that lump sum contributions to VEAP are included in the monthly VEAP data DFAS-DE sends to VA. 64.8.6.  Disenrollment  and  refund  procedures  are  the  responsibility  of  FSOs  or  GSUs. Members  wishing  to  disenroll  from  VEAP  must  initiate  their  requests  for  disenrollment through the FSO or GSU by completing VA Form 5281. 64.8.6.1.  Members  who  have  contributed  less  than  12  consecutive  months  will  be disenrolled  only  upon  approval  of  their  commanding  officer.  Such  a  request  for disenrollment and refund can be approved only for hardship. 64.8.6.2.  Forward  the  completed  VA  Form  5281  to  the  FSO  for  completion  and forwarding  to  the  nearest  Veterans  Administration  (VA)  regional  officer  (including Alaska,  Hawaii  and  Puerto  Rico).    Overseas  FSOs  should  send  completed  VA  Forms 5281 to: VA Regional Office (242)  941 North Capitol Street    Washington D.C., 20421   AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 999  Addresses  of  VA  regional  offices  are  contained  in  Attachment  4.    By  law,  VA  may take  up  to  60  days  to  refund  member’s  contributions.  Since  errors  on  the  VA  Form 5281 may slow VA processing of the refund, accomplish the following steps before the form is mailed: 64.8.6.2.1.  Print or type all answers to ensure readability. 64.8.6.2.2.  Verify member’s full name and SSN. 64.8.6.2.3.  Ensure member’s address is current and correct for VA check mailing. 64.8.6.2.4.  In  the  command  address  block,  ensure  the  address  is  the  member’s current unit of assignment. 64.8.6.2.5.  Verify necessary signatures are valid and present. 64.8.6.2.6.  Check  MMPA (company code 9999963) was stopped. to  verify  month  and  date  allotment to  VEAP 64.8.7.  Members  with  an  active  allotment  or  who  have  contributed  a  lump  sum  payment within  the  preceding  calendar  quarter  will  receive  a  quarterly  VEAP  statement.    All members  with  a  VEAP  account  will  receive  an  annual  statement  during  the  first  quarter.  These  statements  are  mailed  to  the  member’s  LES  mailing  address  and  are  based  on  data contained in the member’s VEAP master banking record at the Veteran’s Administration. 64.8.8.  The  FSO  will  act  as  an  intermediary  between  the  member  and  DFAS-DE  on  VA and  will  respond  to  the  inquiry  or  contact  the  VA  Hines  DPC.    Members  are  not  to directly  contact  VA  or DFAS-DE.   The  FSO  obtains  the  answer  and  informs  member.   A private VA telephone number is available for use by FSO personnel only (not to be given to members) by contacting DFAS-PMJSAA/ DE, DSN 926-7213. 64.8.9.  Improperly completed refund applications (VA Form 5281) will be returned by VA to the  FSO  for  correction;  following  FSO  correction,  the  VA  Form  5281  will  be  returned  to the VA.   Members may choose to redistribute VEAP funds without requiring withdrawal of money and re-depositing the funds  to  increase  monthly  benefits.   For  example,  if  original allotment  was  for  $75/month  for  36  months  entitling  member to  benefits  of $225/month  for  36  months  and  the  member  wishes  to  re-deposit  funds  to  represent  a contribution of $100 for 27 months resulting in a benefit of $300/month for 27 months.  FSOs may complete a DD Form 2558 indicating in the Remarks section that the member  requests redistribution  of  funds  at  a  specific  dollar  amount  per  month.    Mail  DD  Forms  2558 directly to DFAS-PMJSAA/DE, 6760 Irvington Place, Denver CO 80279-3000 for action. 64.9.  $600  Additional  Contribution  for  MGIB.  The  Veterans  Benefits  and  Health  Care Improvement Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-419) authorized that beginning May 1, 2001, MGIB participants  may  elect  to  contribute  an  additional  sum  up  to $600,  which  is  not  refundable,  to increase  their  monthly  rate  of  educational  benefits.    This  program  is  not  available  to  VEAP program  participants  converting  to  the  MGIB  program  at  any  time.    Eligible  members  may make  these  contributions  at  any  time  while  on  active  duty,  over  and  above  the  $1200  pay reduction,  and  may  contribute  up  to  an  additional  $600,  with  a  minimum  contribution  of $20, increased in $20 increments.  Members are  not required to  contribute the  entire $600;  however the  benefits  they  receive  will  be  based  on  how  much  they  contribute.    This  is  a  permanent program.  Members can start and stop these contributions as they wish.  Members can either elect 1000 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 to  do  a  full  lump  sum  ($600),  a  partial  lump  sum  (for  example,  a  member  can  decide  to contribute  $80  and  then,  a  year  later,  decide  to  contribute  another  $80;  these  would  be considered partial lump sums), or by payroll deduction. 64.9.1.  Tax  Implications:    None.    The  $600  additional  contribution  is  not  a  reduction  of entitlement and will not reduce taxable wages. 64.9.2.  Enrollment:    Education  offices  are  responsible  for  enrolling  members  for  the additional  contribution  and  for  answering  all  entitlement  and  eligibility  questions  on  this program.  The FSO  is only  responsible  for  collecting and  processing the  collections  for  the additional  contribution.    The  collections  may  be  either  by  lump  sum,  partial  lump  sum,  or by  monthly  payroll  deduction.    Eligible  individuals  must  elect  to  participate  at  the  local education office using DD Form 2366.  NOTE:  The $600 additional contribution will not be open to members switching from VEAP to MGIB. 64.9.3.  Finance Procedures. 64.9.3.1.  The  DE01  for  the  $600  additional  contribution  program  will  only  be established  at  a  member’s  request.  It  will  not  be  automatically  started  by  DJMS-AC. Finance  must  establish  the  deduction,  using  A  DE  entry,  with  transaction  type  A.  If the  member  does  not  elect  monthly deductions then  finance  will update these accounts as  payments  are  received.  In  order  to  contribute  without  using  payroll  deduction,  the member  must  bring  cash,  cashier’s  check,  or  a  money  order  payable  to  the  local finance  office  for  forwarding  to  DFAS-JD/DE.  These  collections  must  be  accompanied by  the  proper  collection  voucher  and  include  a  statement  identifying  the  collection  as specifically  for  Montgomery  G  I  Bill.  Two  open  DE  entries  can  be  on  the  MMPA  at the  same time--one  for the  basic MGIB (type code  W) and  one  for the $600 additional MGIB benefit (type A). Cancellation of any DE will only be done at Central Site, just as they  are  currently  processed  for  MGIB.  Follow  procedures  for  contributions  at separation in  paragraph 64.4.2 and 64.4.3 above. 64.9.3.2.  To  stop  deductions,  use  a  DE04  transaction.    The  DE04  transaction  to  stop collection  action  will  process  on  the  first  of  the  following  month  just  as  the  current DE01 processes  on the  first  of  the  following  month.   This  will  allow  the  entry  to  stop deduction  action  and  yet  remain  open on the MMPA.  The DE04 entry can be input by base-level and central site. 64.10.  VEAP  to  MGIB  Open  Window  for  $2,700.  The  Veterans  benefits  and  health  care improvement act of 2000 (Public Law 106-419) authorized an open window to allow enrollment of VEAP participants in the  MGIB.   This  program became  effective 1  March 2001.   The  open window for enrollment began 1 March 2001 and ends October 31, 2001; however, members have a full 18 months from their decision date (the date they signed the DD Form 2366) to complete payment.  This program requires that  members pay $2,700 either  by  monthly  deduction (can be any amount) or a lump sum payment can also be made. 64.10.1.  Enrollment:  Education offices are responsible for enrolling members in the program and  eligible  individuals  must  elect  to  participate  at  the  local  education  office,  using  DD Form 2366, between 1 March 2001 and 31 October 2001.   Do  not  process a DD  Form 2366 for this program that is dated after 31 October 2001. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1001 64.10.2.  Finance Overview:  Establish the deduction for the open window using a DE entr y, type V. 64.10.3.  Separations/Retirements:  Individuals who are separating, but not retiring, must pay the  full  $2,700  before  their  discharge  from  active  duty.    However,  retirees  can  make payments  from  their retired pay.  If a retiree wishes to make payments to retired pay, or have payroll deductions  made  from  his/her  retired  pay,  the  retiree  must  submit  the  following  to retired  pay  in  Cleveland  (address  given  below).  NOTE:  In  all  cases,  the  $2,700  must  be paid within 18-months after the member enrolled in the program. 64.10.3.1.  A copy of the DD Form 2366. 64.10.3.2.  If  member  has  paid  part  of  the  $2,700  for  the  open  window  while  on  active duty, he or she should submit documentation to prove what has already been collected by active duty. 64.10.3.3.  If the retiree wants payment to be made by allotment, a completed DD 2558, to have the desired amount deducted from retired pay, must be submitted to DFAS-CL. 64.10.3.4.  If  the  retiree  chooses  to  pay  by  lump  sum,  he/she  must  submit  a  payment (check  or  money  order)  made  payable  to  “Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service”, ensuring “MGIB” is written on the memo line of the check. 64.10.3.5.  The  above  documentation  and  lump  sum  payments,  as  well  as  any correspondence  for  retired  pay,  should  be  sent  to:    Defense  Finance  and  Accounting Service,  Military  Retired  Pay,  P.O.  Box  7130,  London,  KY  40742-7130.    The  phone number  for retired  pay  in  Cleveland is 1-800-321-1080.   1002 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 64.1.  DE01 Format to Start MGIB Deductions.

JUMPS  Voucher  Balancing/MAFR  Reconciliation  Report  (PCN  MP-19-173)  for Collections.  See Chapter 76 of this volume. 65.7.  Collections Reported After Separation.  Use appropriate collection input. 65.8.  Substitute  Checks.  If  a  member  receives  a  substitute  check,  Paying  and  Collecting prepares  and  forwards  a  copy  of  AF  Form  3126,  General  Purpose,  with  substitute  check information to military pay. 65.9.  Collections  for  Jury  Duty  Fees  Paid  to  Military  Members.  O n  4  Nov  l982,  the Comptroller   General  of  the  United  States  ruled  an  active  duty  military  member  performing jury duty may keep jury fees received only if the jury duty was performed when the member was in a leave status.  If the jury duty was performed when the member was not in a leave status, the member may not retain jury fees (as distinguished from expenses). 65.9.1.  Fees Versus Expenses.  The member may keep monies received and identified as for expenses  (for  example,  transportation  expenses)  whether  or  not  in  a  leave  status.  Use  the court  documents (for example,  order,  subpoena,  summons,  official  request,  etc.)  received by the  member to determine whether the court paid a jury fee or expense.  When there is a question,  contact  the  local  judge  advocate  office  for  assistance  in  making  a  determination. Many  states  now  use  an  expense  allowance  reimbursement  system  rather  than  fees. Therefore,  members  performing  jury  duty  in  these  courts  would  receive  no  fees  requiring collection.  Your base JA should be contacted to determine the system in use in the local state. 65.9.2.  Identification  of  Members.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  member's  immediate supervisor  to  inform  the  local  finance  office  whenever  a  member  is  granted  an  excused absence not involving leave  for jury  duty.   Once a  member  has  been identified,  the  finance officer must establish a follow-up suspense to ensure the fees are collected. 65.9.3.  Collection  Procedures.    Jury  fees  collected  from  military  members  are  to  be deposited  into  receipt  account  573210  .9999,  Receipts  Not  Otherwise  Classified.    The military  pay  area  is  to  use  a  DD  Form  1131,  with  a  CP  voucher  number  prefix  for  these collections.  No C203 or C903 transactions are required.  If the member cannot  make a cash payment,  the  military  pay  area  is  to  process  a  DS01  transaction  using  Chapter  69 guidelines. 65.10.  Collection  of  Witness  Fees.  When  a  member  acts  as  a  witness  and  is  not  in  a  leave status, or on scheduled off duty time, he or she is indebted to the United States Government for the fees received for acting as a witness.  The member may keep monies received and identified as  for  expenses  (for  example,  transportation  expense)  whether  or  not  in  a  leave  status  or  on scheduled  off  duty  time.  Use  the  same  procedures  for  collection  of  witness  fees  as  used  for collection of Jury Duty fees. 65.11.  Cash Collection of Court-Martial Fines.  Per the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, a fine is in the nature  of  a  judgment.    It  makes  a  member  pecuniarily  liable  to  the  United  States  for  the amounts specified in the sentence.  They may be either: 65.11.1.  Paid in cash by the member. 65.11.2.  Collected by deduction from the member's current pay, or 65.11.3.  Collected by deduction on settlement of a member's pay account at discharge.  When a  member  has  been  tried  by  court  martial  and  ordered  to  pay  a  fine  in  cash,  there  is  no AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1007  requirement  to  enter  the  cash  collection  onto  the  pay  account.    Court-martial  fines  for enlisted members, who have been ordered to pay in cash, are to be collected into the Treasury Trust  Fund  Receipt  Account  for  the  Armed  Forces  Retirement  Homes  (84  8522.0003). Court-martial fines for officers, who have been ordered to pay  in  cash,  are  to  be  collected into the  military personnel appropriation (57* 3500 32* 999.07S525725) 65.12.  Cash Collection of Advance Pay.  Members have the option to make partial repayments in cash. Process cash collection, on a DD Form 1131, as a C203.  (See Chapter 35.) 65.13.  Cash Collection for Overpayment of TLA.  Use DD Form 1131 as collection voucher, processing as a C3 transaction (Figure 65.5). 1008 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 65.1.

Held  Pay  is  a  method  (either  voluntary  or  involuntary)  of  specifying  a monthly amount to be withheld from a member's pay.  The types of held pay are: 66.1.1.  Held Pay - Member's request.  (See paragraph 66.2) 66.1.2.  Held Pay - Commander/FSO request.  (See paragraph 66.3) 66.1.3.  Held Pay - Garnishment.  (See paragraph 66.4) 66.2.  Held Pay-Member's Request: 66.2.1.  Purpose.   Held pay  -  member's request is a  method by  which  a  member  specifies  a monthly amount to be withheld from his or her regular pay.  This type of held pay is strictly voluntary. 66.2.2.  Member: 66.2.2.1.  Can elect to have pay withheld from their regular pay. 66.2.2.2.  Can request withholding be stopped. 66.2.2.3.  Can change the monthly amount being withheld. 66.2.2.4.  May request payment of any amount withheld. 66.2.2.5.  May request any amount withheld be released into his/her regular net pay. 66.2.3.  Documents Required: 66.2.3.1.  DD Form 114, Military Pay Order (MPO). 66.2.3.2.  Money list line item supporting payment (Chapter 37). 66.2.4.  FSO: 66.2.4.1.  Prepares DD Form 114 (Figure 66.1) to start or stop pay withholding.  Effective date of a start action is the first day of the month withholding is to begin.  Effective date of stop action is the last day of the month withholding is to stop. 66.2.4.2.  Based  upon  request  from  member,  prepares  DD  Form  114  to  change withholding amount.   Effective date for a change action is the first day of the month in which the change is desired. 66.2.4.3.  Based  upon  request  from  the  member  to  release  an  amount  into  his  or  her regular  pay,  prepares an  MPO  specifying  the amount and  date to  be  released.  Effective date for a release action is any date within current month. 66.2.4.4.  Prepares and  submits a DJMS input transaction record in  the  format  shown in Figure 66.3. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1017  66.2.4.5.  Pays  member  all  or  part  of  accumulated  balances.  (See  Chapter  37)  Upon request  from  the  member  for  a  payment,  the  paying  FSO  uses  reasonable  means  to confirm  the  balance  by reviewing DFAS Form 702, Leave and Earnings Statement, or by making an inquiry to DFAS-DE. 66.2.4.6.  Prepares  and  submits  a  DJMS  input  transaction  record  in  format  shown  in Figure 66.5. 66.2.5.  Rejects.  See Chapter 4. 66.3.  Held Pay-Commander/FSO Request: 66.3.1.  Purpose.    Held  pay  -  Commander/FSO  request  is  a  method  of  withholding  pay otherwise  due  the  member,  when  the  member  has  submitted  a  remission  application  for  a debt.    (See  Chapter  73)  This  procedure  is  used  at  the  discretion  of  the  commander/FSO subject  to  the  conditions  in  b  below.  The  amount  of  pay  withheld  may  not  exceed  the maximum collection rate specified in paragraph 69.6. 66.3.2.  Conditions: 66.3.2.1.  All of the following conditions  must apply  before  withholding pay (except  for advance leave which will become excess upon separation): 66.3.2.1.1.  Member instrumentalities. is indebted to the  United  States  Government  or its 66.3.2.1.2.  The  member  is  projected to  separate and the amount  of  the  debt  cannot be  collected  from  the  member's  projected  final  pay  if  the  remission  application  is denied.    FSOs  should  use  "HELD  PAY  COMMANDER/FSO  REQUEST"  to  hold monies due the US prior to a member's separation. 66.3.2.2.  When a member has advance leave which will become excess upon separation and  has  signed  AF  Form  988,  Leave  Request/Authorization,  the  FSO  may  withhold  a portion of the member's pay to satisfy the debt.  The member's signature on AF Form 988 signifies consent for with-  holding  pay  for the advance leave  which  will  become  excess upon separation. 66.3.3.  Document  Required.  Commander  requires  FSO  to  start  this  type  of  held  pay  by signed certificate  (Figure  66.1).    Subsequent  actions  stopping,  changing,  or  canceling  held pay also require  commander's  certificate  and  MPO.    A  release  (FORMAT-ID  HB13)  is not  processed  at  base  level;  DFAS-DE  releases  balance  in  account  based  on  remission decision. 66.3.4.  Effect.    Start,  stop,  change  or  cancel  held-pay  transactions  have  these  effects  on MMPA: 66.3.4.1.  Start  (01).   Starts  withholding  pay  at  commander's  request  and  accumulates amount withheld. 66.3.4.2.  Stop (02).  Stops withholding as of transaction effective date.  No action is taken on balance that has been withheld as a result of this action. 66.3.4.3.  Change  (04).  Begins  withholding  at  new  rate  and  on  effective  date  shown  in transaction. No action is taken on balance that has been withheld. 1018 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 66.3.4.4.  Cancel  (06).  Cancels  withholding  and  releases  amounts  withheld.  Action  is dated same date as start action it cancels.  Amounts released are added to a member's next regular  pay.  If  original  transaction  is  effective  in  a  future  month,  do  not  process cancel  transaction  until  original  transaction  appears  on  your  daily  DTR  as  processed.  A closed HB entry cannot be canceled. 66.3.5.  Input.  Prepare input transactions in format shown in Figure 66.4. 66.4.  Held Pay-Garnishments: 66.4.1.  Purpose.    A  held  pay  for  garnishment  is  used  to  withhold  pay  otherwise  due  a member, for payment of court-ordered child support or alimony to the proper court. 66.4.2.  General.   While DFAS-DE receives most court-ordered garnishments for dependent support  directly  from  the  courts,  the  FSO  may  receive  them  also.    Upon  receipt  of  such  a document, it  should  be  forwarded IMMEDIATELY to DFAS-DE/DG, 6760 E. Irvington  Pl, Denver CO  80279-8000. 66.4.3.  Procedures. 66.4.3.1.  Upon  receipt  of  a  court-ordered  garnishment  for  dependent  support,  DFAS-GAG/CL  will  adjudicate  the  document,  specifying  the  legal  obligations  of  the member,  and  transmit  a  garnishment  (HG)  transaction  to  the  automated  garnishment system (AGS). 66.4.3.2.  A  notification  letter  is  automatically  generated,  when  the  HG  transaction  is processed,  informing  the  member  that  a  court  ordered  garnishment  has  been  received. The  notification  letter  contains  the  terms  of  the  garnishment,  any  suppression  action required, and advice on stopping allotments, if necessary. 66.4.3.3.  No transaction input from the FSO is required. 66.4.3.4.  Held  pay  amounts  remain  in  the  original  military  pay  appropriation,  57*3500 510 or 530 (as applicable), until released. 66.4.3.5.  Effective  1  March  2002,  garnishments  will  not  be  prorated.    For  example, even  if  a  member  does  not  serve  a  full  month,  the  full  amount  of  the  garnishment  is deducted,  based  on  the  amount  of  the  member’s  disposable  earnings.    We  will  not  pro-rate based on the number of the days the member was paid in the month. 66.4.4.  Points  of  contact  for  the  FSO  are  Cleveland  (DFAS-GAG/CL)  for  legal determinations,  address  changes,  and  payment  inquiries.    Contact  DFAS-PMJSAC/DE  for returned  checks  and  payment  histories.    The  customer  service  number  for  Cleveland  is  1-866-859-1845  or  the  member  can  contact  them  through  the  web  site  provided  on  the notification letters  www.dfas.mil/money/garnish or  fax  document  to  216-522-6960.  The customer  service number for Denver is 1-800-433-0461 option 4, DSN 926-7348. 66.5.  Held Pay-Other. 66.5.1.  All other held pay is generated as a by-product of central site processing. 66.5.2.

Description.  Various sentences  associated  with  courts-martial  and  non-judicial punishment  affect  member's  pay  and  allowances  differently.    The  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A, chapters 48 and 49, describe the effects as follows: 67.1.1.  Forfeitures: 67.1.1.1.  Partial  Forfeitures.    A  sentence  to  partial  forfeiture  of  pay  deprives  a member  of  the  amount  of  pay  stated  in  the  sentence.    The  sentence  applies  for  the number of months or days expressly stated. 67.1.1.2.  Effective  Date.    Court  martial  sentences  to  forfeitures  or  grade  reduction become  effective  on  the  earlier  of  14  days  after  the  date  on  which  the  sentence  was adjudged  or  on  the  date  approved  by  the  convening  authority,  unless  the  convening authority  defers  application  of  the  forfeitures  pending  completion  of  further  appellate review.    (This  is  effective  for  court  martial  sentences  adjudged  after  31  March  1996. Prior  to  that  time  they  were  effective  when  approved  by  the  convening  authority.)  When  a  sentence  includes  forfeiture  and  suspended  confinement,  or  includes forfeitures without confinement, the forfeiture will apply to pay (and allowances, if total forfeitures are adjudged) becoming due on or after the date the sentence is effective. 67.1.1.3.  Automatic  Forfeitures.    An  accused  receiving  a  sentence  to  death  or confinement  for more than  six  months,  or a  punitive  discharge and  confinement  for  six month or less, automatically forfeits pay and allowances up to the jurisdictional limit of the court, (general court martial (GCM) - total forfeitures of pay and allowances, special court martial (SPCM) - 2/3 forfeitures of pay only) during the period on confinement or any  subsequent  parole.  NOTE:  The  amount  of  time  in  confinement  used  to  determine which of these forfeitures apply should be reduced by the amount of pre-trial confinement if  credit  is  given  for  the  pre-trial  confinement.  For  example,  an  8-month  sentence  in which the member has served and been  given credit for 4-months’ pre-trial confinement would be considered as a 4-month sentence (consider only the amount of the sentence to be  served  after  the  date  the  sentence  is  adjudged).    The  convening  authority,  however, has the authority to waive any  or all of the  forfeitures for the  period of  confinement not to exceed six months, so as to direct payment to provide for the support of the accused’s dependents.  This  is  effective  for  all  court-martial  sentences  announced  on  or  after 1 April 1996. 67.1.2.  Fines.  A fine is in the nature of a judgment.  It makes a member pecuniarily liable to the  US  for  the  amounts  specified  in  the  sentence.  Fines  are  not  self-executing.  They  are debts to the government until: 67.1.2.1.  paid in cash by the member, 67.1.2.2.  collected by deduction from the member's current pay, or 67.1.2.3.  collected by deduction on settlement of a member's pay account at discharge. 1026 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 67.1.3.  Forfeiture  of  allowances.    Allowances  are  forfeited  only  when  a  sentence  by  a general court-martial includes forfeiture of all pay and allowances. 67.1.4.  Application  of  Forfeitures.  This  means are  withheld  (as  distinguished  from  collected)  on  and  after  the  date  a  sentence  is  effective.    It  applies when  a  court-martial  sentence,  as  approved  by  the  convening  authority,  includes  forfeiture and confinement, not suspended, or deferred, and  the  sentence  is  such that  further  appellate review is required before the sentence can be ordered executed. forfeitures that 67.1.5.  Execution  of  Forfeitures.    This  means  actual  collection  of  forfeitures  when  a sentence is ordered executed.  The order of execution authorizes the collection of any monies withheld during the period  specified in the  convening authority's  initial  order  to apply the forfeitures, and any monies remaining to  be  collected  from  pay during the remainder  of the period of the approved sentence.  If any amount ordered forfeited is not actually withheld or collected  during  the  period  specified  by  the  approved  sentence,  such  amount  may  be involuntarily collected as an  erroneous  payment as provided in rule 3, table 7-7-1, at a rate not to exceed the maximum authorized by rule 2, table 7-7-6.   However, the  collection rate will not be less than that fixed by the approved sentence. 67.1.6.  Non-judicial  Punishment.    Under  authority  of  Article  15,  UCMJ  (10  USC  815), authorized  commanders  may  impose  non-judicial  punishment  for  minor  offenses  without resorting to courts-martial.  Non-judicial punishments which affect pay are forfeiture of pay, reduction  in  grade  or  combinations  of  these.    Except  as  specifically  stated  in  DoDFMR, Volume  7A,  chapter  49,  the  provisions  in chapter 48  of  part  seven relating to  forfeiture  of pay and reduction in grade by courts-martial also apply when such penalties are imposed as non-judicial punishment. 67.2.  Substantiating Documents.  Support input with court-martial orders (CMOs) or record of trial  for  summary  court-martial  (assign  number  to  order  and  use  as  an  MPO  or  attach  to  DD Form  114,  Military  Pay Order (MPO)).  A  message  showing the  essentials of the CMO  may  be used as a substantiating document until receipt of the CMO. 67.2.1.  Distribution of CMOs.  Judge Advocate (JA) furnishes FSO two copies of all CMOs. 67.2.2.  Distribution  of Summary  Court-Martial  Records (SCM Records).    JA  furnishes the servicing FSO two signed copies of the record of trial when member's pay is affected, under cover  of  AF  Form  1373,  MPO  Document  Control  Log  -  Transmittal.    AF  Form  1373  is prepared  in  original  and  one  copy.    JA  keeps  a  copy  of  AF  Form  1373  and  takes  tracer action  no  later  than  the  5th  workday  after  transmission  if  a  daily  register  of  transactions (DROT) has not been received from the FSO. 67.2.3.  Article 15 Correspondence: 67.2.3.1.  When  a  member's  pay  is  affected,  JA  furnishes  the  servicing  FSO  two  signed copies of AF Form 3070, Record of Non-judicial Punishment Proceedings, or AF Form 3071,  Record  of  Recommended  Non-judicial  Punishment  Proceedings,  with  any endorsements (excluding evidentiary material) along with AF Form 1373.  AF Form 1373 is prepared in original and one copy.  JA keeps a copy of AF Form 1373 and takes tracer action no later than the 5th workday after transmission if a DROT has not been received from the FSO. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1027  67.2.3.2.  Article 15 correspondence not affecting a member's pay and summarized records of punishment continue to be processed by JA per AFI 51-202. 67.2.3.3.  Determination  of  Effective  Date.  The  effective  date  of  the  Article  15 punishment,  when  the  punishment  is  reduction  in  grade,  is  the  date  the  commander signs the imposition of punishment.  When a member appeals the Article 15, reduction in grade remains in effect while action on the appeal is pending.  If the appeal is denied, the effective  date  of  the  punishment  remains  the  date  of the  endorsement  that  imposed  the punishment.  See AFI 51-202, table 2, rules 5 and 6, columns B and D, note 2.  However, if the member appeals and is  within 30 days of  separation, the  collection is  not  held up pending action on the appeal. 67.3.  Responsibilities: 67.3.1.  Staff  Judge  Advocate.  The  Staff  Judge  Advocate  is  responsible  for  distributing Court-Martial Orders, Summary Court-Martial Records and Article 15 Correspondence. 67.3.2.  FSO.    Servicing  FSO  is  responsible  for  input  to  DJMS.    (See  paragraph  67.7  for input  instructions.)    If  finance  is  unable  to  process  the  required  transactions  (for  example, total forfeitures), contact DFAS-JFLTBA/IN for assistance. 67.4.  FSO Actions: 67.4.1.  Processing  of CMOs:   FSO  prepares and  processes an MPO  when member's pay is affected.  CMOs  are  numbered  in  sequence  on  a  calendar-year  basis.    Establish  controls  to ensure receipt of all required copies. 67.4.2.  Processing  of  Summary  Court-Martial  Records  (SCM  Records).    The  FSO acknowledges receipt  of  these  records  by  furnishing a DROT to  JA,  showing  transactions input  by  JA  (as  input  source).  This  provides  evidence  that  action  has  been  started  and transactions have processed to member's MMPA. 67.4.3.  Processing  of  Article  15  Correspondence.  The  FSO  acknowledges  receipt  of  these records by furnishing a DROT to JA, showing transactions input by JA (as input source).  This provides evidence that action  has been  started and transactions  have  processed to  member's MMPA. 67.4.4.  Priority.    All  CMOs,  summary  court  martial  (SCM)  records,  and  article  15 correspondence  require  priority  action.    FSO  immediately  prepares  required  MPOs  and required transactions. 67.5.  Special Provisions: 67.5.1.  Court-Martial  Sentences  --  Officers  and  Airmen.  Handling  amounts  affected  by court-martial  sentence  requires  a  specific  coverage  because  of  difference  in tax adjustments  and  disposition  of  funds.  Basically,  fines  do  not  reduce  taxable  wages  while forfeitures do.  Court-Martial fines and forfeitures  for regular  enlisted  members are  credited to  the  AFRH,  while  those  for  non-regular  enlisted  members  and  all  commissioned  officers are retained in, or credited to, the military pay appropriation. 1028 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 67.5.2.  Allotments: 67.5.2.1.  Starting  Allotments.   A  person  in  confinement  awaiting  trial  by  general  or special court-martial may  not  start an allotment.    A  member  who  wishes to reapply  for National  Service  Life  Insurance  or  for  reinstatement  of  government  insurance  submits an  application,  with  provision  for  direct  payments,  to  the  appropriate  VA  office.  No Class N allotments may be started. 67.5.2.2.  Stopping Allotments.  If an airman's term of enlistment expires while he or she is  confined,  stop  all  allotments  as  of  end  of  month  before  ETS.  If  notice  to  stop allotments is received too late in month to meet established cut-off dates and member has enough  accrued  pay  and  allowances,  allotments  may  be  deducted  to  include  month  in which ETS occurs. 67.5.3.  Illegal Sentence  -- Reimbursement for Pay.  A member is entitled to reimbursement for  pay  withheld  under  an  illegal  sentence  of  a  court-martial  or  Article  15.    However, member  must  submit  a  claim  to  DFAS-JFLTBA/IN  when  amount  has  been  collected  into trust fund receipt account 578930.6 and the history indebtedness (DF) deduction is no longer present  on  the  MMPA.    Process  an  E706  or  E806  if  the  DF  history  is  still  present  on  the MMPA. 67.5.4.  Forfeiture.  There are instances when a commander orders or a convening authority approves a  partial  forfeiture of pay  for 2  or  more  months and the FSO is  unable to  process the  forfeiture in the first  month.  If  the  forfeiture  is  processed in a  succeeding month, there are  cases  where  the  member  does  not  receive  any  pay  because  the  reduction  includes amounts  covering  the  previous  month's  forfeiture.    Since  the  two-thirds  rule  applies  and collections cannot exceed two-thirds of the member's pay, the FSO should take these interim actions: 67.5.4.1.  Compute the amount that is due the member based on the two-thirds rule. 67.5.4.2.  Issue  a  partial  for  the  difference  between  amount  received  by  the  member (include allotments in your calculation) and the one-third due the member. 67.5.4.3.  Process  the  PK  transaction  in  the  normal  manner.    This  action  results  in  an increased  indebtedness  for  the  member  but  will  allow  payment  to  the  member  in  the proper  amount.    This  procedure  must  be  repeated  until  the  debt  is  liquidated  or  the member begins receiving one-third of his or her pay. 67.5.5.  Court  Martial  Waivers.   An  accused  receiving  a  sentence  to  death  or  confinement for  more  than  six  months,  or a punitive  discharge and  confinement  for  six  months  or less, automatically forfeits pay and allowances up to the jurisdictional limit of the court during the period of confinement or any subsequent parole.  The convening authority, however, has the authority to waive any or all of the forfeitures  for the  period  of  confinement,  not to exceed six  months,  so  as  to  direct  an  involuntary  allotment  to  provide  for  the  support  of  the accused’s  dependents.    This  is  effective  for  all  court-martial  sentences  announced  on  or after 1 April 1996. 67.5.5.1.  Responsibilities:    Legal  is  responsible  for  processing  the  waiver  requests approved  by  the  convening  authority  and  providing  the  following  information  to local  finance offices on approved requests: AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1029  67.5.5.1.1.  Copy of waiver request (if submitted). 67.5.5.1.2.  Copy of approval of waiver request-should include amount approved.  The amount should be expressed in dollar amounts. 67.5.5.1.3.  Full names of payees. 67.5.5.1.4.  Proof  of  dependency  of  payees  or  a  certification  that  the  payees  are dependents  of  the  member.    If  payment  is  to  be  made  to  someone  other  than  the actual  dependents  on  behalf  of  the  dependents  (for  example,  payments  made  to  an ex-wife  on  behalf  of  minor  children),  provide  confirmation  that  the  designated payee is the appointed executor or custodian of the dependents. 67.5.5.1.5.  Payment  information  should  be  either  electronic  funds  transfer  (EFT) information  or  check  mailing  information.  EFT  information:  SF  1199A,  Direct Deposit  Sign-Up  Form,  or  FMS  2231,  FASTSTART  Direct  Deposit  Form.    The dependents name (or appointed executor or custodian’s name) must be on the account the  payment  is  to.  The  payment  may  not  be  made  to  an  account  over  which  the member  has  signature  authority.    If  a  check  will  be  issued,  the  mailing address  the check is to be sent to must be provided. 67.5.5.1.6.  Statement  signed  by  payee  and  member  agreeing  to  notify  legal  and finance if the  payee  ceases  being  a  dependent  during  the  period  these  payments  are made,  (for  example,  a  divorce  during  this  period  would  cause  the  spouse   (now the  ex-spouse) to  no longer  be a dependent). 67.5.5.2.  Finance  will,  based  on  the  information  provided  by  legal  and/or  the  member as  necessary,  make  appropriate  payment  to  the  dependent(s).  If  a  check  will  be  issued, the FSO must suppress the member’s pay and issue a partial to the dependents. 67.5.5.3.  The  amount  paid  to  the  dependents  should  be  whatever  the  waived  amount is  with  deductions  made  only  for  federal,  state  and  FICA  taxes  withheld  from  the waived  portion  of  taxable  pay  and  allowances  that  are  otherwise  subject  to  forfeiture. The  remaining  amount  should  be  paid  to  the  member’s  dependents,  as  directed  by  the convening  authority.    The  waived  portion  of  the  taxable  pay  an  allowances  remains taxable  income  to  the  member,  even  though  the  payments  are  made  to  the  member’s dependents. 67.5.5.4.  Also,  finance will  need to  suspend  existing  indebtedness  transactions and stop existing allotments.  The allotments should be restarted once the waiver of forfeiture is no longer  in  effect.  When  a  member  has  a  total  forfeiture  and  part  of  that  forfeiture  has been  waived,  the  member  is  still  considered  to  be  in  a  no  pay  status;  therefore,  SGLI coverage  would  be  discontinued  at  the  end  of  the  31st  day  of  a  continuous  period  of military  confinement  imposed  by  court-martial  sentence,  which  also  imposes  total forfeiture of pay and allowances.  No deductions are required for periods after the SGLI coverage is discontinued.  With regard to the first 31 days of coverage during which total forfeitures  take  effect,  the  cost  of  the  coverage  should  be  established  as  a  debt  of  the member.    No  deductions  should  be  made  for  FMDP  coverage,  AFRH  deductions  and MGIB  reductions  as  the  member  is  in  a  no  pay  status,  regardless  of  waivers  to dependents. 1030 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 67.5.5.5.  In  the  case of  existing  garnishments, a  copy of the  waiver approval  should  be faxed immediately to DFAS-HGA/CL at toll free 1-877-622-5930, Commercial 216-522-6960  or  DSN  580-6960,  along  with  an  explanation  that  the  member  has  an  existing garnishment that  will  need  to  be  stopped  for the  period  of the  waiver.   DFAS-HGA/CL will notify DFAS-JFLTBB to stop the garnishment. 67.5.5.5.1.  Send  a  message  to  DFAS-JFLTBA/IN  to  prepare  a  memo  entry  on  the pay record indicating that because of a waiver of forfeiture, payments in the amount of $(dollar amount) are being directed to dependents for the time period of (state time period). 67.5.5.5.2.  DFAS-JFLTBA/IN  will  prepare  memo  entries  as  requested.    DFAS-JFLTBB/IN  will  stop  collection  action  on  garnishments  upon  receipt  of  supporting documentation to do so. 67.6.  DFAS-IN  Actions.  When  servicing  FSO  has  processed  the  transaction  for  forfeiture, DFAS will take action to stop the clothing allowance and to correct CP 33. 67.7.  Source of Input: 67.7.1.  Staff Judge  Advocate.  Distributes  one  copy  of all general and special  court-martial orders (CMO) to servicing FSO with information copy to DFAS-IN/JFLTBA.  FSO copy is used only as an advance (memo) document.  If the distribution of the CMO will be delayed, a message  showing  the  essential  contents  of  the  CMO  may  be  transmitted  to  the  servicing FSO.    However,  a  copy  of  the  CMO  must  be  distributed  to  the  servicing  FSO  as  soon  as possible.  For a summary court-martial, no CMOs are issued.  Convening authority sends two copies of the record of trial to servicing FSO. 67.7.2.  FSO.  Servicing FSO is responsible for input to DJMS.  Transactions may start (01), stop (02) or cancel (06) MMPA entries and release (13) pay held.  If a member is ordered to forfeit  all  pay  and  allowances,  stop  all  allotments  and  all  entitlements  that  can  be  stopped using  base-level transactions.   Then  process an  E701  for  the  forfeiture  of  base  pay using a code 2 in record position (CP) 33.  DFAS will take action to stop the clothing allowance and to correct CP 33.  Forward a copy of all documents in the FSO management files pertaining to total forfeitures to DFAS-IN/JFLTBA per Chapter 2, paragraph 2.4.10. 67.8.  Input Format.

Description.  The  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  FY  2000  (Public  Law 106–65),  as  amended  by  the  Floyd  D.  Spence  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2001  (Public  Law  106-398),  extended  the  opportunity  to  participate  in  the  TSP  to members of the uniformed services. 68.2.  References. 68.2.1.  Tsp Website at www.tsp.gov. 68.2.2.  DoDFMR Vol7A, Chap 51, Savings Programs. 68.2.3.  DoDFMR Vol7C, Chap 10, Thrift Savings Plan. 68.3.  Thrift  Savings  Plan  (TSP)  Overview.  The  Thrift  Savings  Plan  is  a  retirement  savings and  investment  plan  established  for  federal  employees  as  part  of  the  Federal  Employees' Retirement  System  Act  of  1986.    Participation  in  the  plan  for  uniformed  service  members  is authorized  by  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  FY  2000  as  amended  by  the  National Defense Authorization Act FY 2001.  The plan offers tax-deferred advantages similar to those in an  Individual  Retirement  Account  (IRA)  or  401(k)  plan.  The  Federal  Retirement  Thrift Investment  Board  (FRTIB)  administers  the  plan  and  publishes  regulations  and  operating guidance.  The National Finance Center (NFC) in New Orleans, Louisiana is the TSP record keeper. 68.4.  Eligibility to Participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). 68.4.1.  Any  member  of  the  uniformed  services  serving  on  active  duty  and  any  member  of the ready reserve in any pay status may participate in the UNISERV TSP in accordance with 5, U.S.C. 8440e. 68.4.2.  A member of the reserve component (Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve) who is also a federal civilian employee will have two TSP accounts if participating in the TSP as a military member and a civilian. 68.5.  Open  Seasons.  Open  Seasons  were  eliminated  in  July  2005.  Historical  information for the purpose of claims adjudication is provided here. 68.5.1.  Any eligible member could elect to participate in the plan and did so by completing the TSP Form U-1 and taking it to the finance office for processing or enrolling via myPay. 68.5.2.  Active  members  had  two  open  seasons,  per  calendar  year,  to  enroll  in  TSP. The  dates  were  established  by  the  FRTIB  and  were  15  April  thru  30  June  and  15  October thru 31 December. Contributions  from  these  open  seasons did  not  begin before the last  full month of the open season, referred to as  the  election period. Example: Member  enrolled in TSP on 15 October, contributions were not deducted until the first payday in December. 1036 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 68.5.3.  Members were able to stop any elective category contribution, i.e. bonus, special, or incentive pay at any time during a calendar year. When the member elected to stop the basic pay  contribution, all  other types  stopped automatically. If the  member  stopped  contributing from  basic  pay,  incentive pay, or special pay during an open season, he/she was not eligible to start contributing again from that category of pay until the next open season. If the member stopped contributing from basic pay, incentive pay, or special pay "outside" an open season, he/she was not be able to restart contributing from that category of pay until the second open season  following  the  termination.  The  member  could  start,  stop  or  restart  bonus  pay contributions at any time, provided the member had an election for basic pay contribution in effect. 68.5.4.  For information on establishing effective dates, see paragraph 68.21.2. 68.6.  Member Transfers. 68.6.1.  New  members  accessed  on  and  after  9  Oct  01,  including  those  with  a  break  in service, may elect to enroll in the TSP within 60 days after joining. A member is deemed to have joined the uniformed service on the date the member becomes eligible to receive basic pay  or  compensation  under  section  206  of  Title  37.  If  a  member  decides  to  begin participation during this 60-day period, the first contribution must be taken the first full pay period after the election is received by the finance office. Keep in mind that no contributions will  be  taken  prior  to  1  Jan  2002.  New  members,  who  do  not  enroll  during  this  60-day window, can elect at a future time. 68.6.2.  Active  to  reserve:  the  TSP  election  can  be  presented  to  the  member’s  gaining servicing  office  or  accomplished  via  myPay  to  continue  TSP  contribution/loan  payments without interruption. 68.6.3.  Reserve  to  Active:  The  TSP  election  can  be  presented  to  the  member’s  gaining servicing  organization  or  accomplished  via  myPay  to  continue  TSP  contributions/loan payments without interruption. 68.6.4.  One  Branch  of  Service  to  another  Branch  of  Service:  The  TSP  election  can  be presented  to  the  member’s  gaining  servicing  organization  or  accomplished  via  myPay  to continue TSP contributions/ loan payments without interruption. 68.6.5.  Contributions  may  be  restarted  by  either  completion  of  a  new  TSP-U-1  or  by  the member presenting his/her LES showing contributions being withheld and using the former percentage rate. If the member wishes to make any changes from the previous withholding, a new TSP-U-1  must  be accomplished. If the member wishes to  continue contributions at the former withholding rate, have the member write "I wish to continue my TSP withholding(s) at  the  rates  as  stated  on  this  LES"  on  a  current  LES.  Have  the  member  sign  and  date  the LES, make a copy for the member, and include the one the member signed with the quarterly document submission (Records Center Handbook available on FTP site for reference) to the DFRC (see paragraph 2.4.6.2.3 of this manual.) 68.7.  Contributions. 68.7.1.  No contributions will be taken prior to 1 Jan 2002. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1037  68.7.2.  All  contributions  must  be  made  to  the  NFC  via  payroll  deduction.  The  maximum contribution  of  basic  pay  may  not  exceed  7  percent  for  any  pay  period  in  calendar  year  (CY)  2002.  This  limit  will  be  increased  to  8  percent  in  2003,  9  percent  in  2004,  10 percent in 2005 and an unlimited percent in 2006 and later.  This unlimited amount may not  exceed  the  IRS  established  cap.    Members  may  also  choose  to  contribute  up  to  100 percent of special and incentive pays and bonuses.  Members must be contributing from basic pay in order to contribute from any other pays/bonuses. 68.7.3.  Service  Matching  Contributions.  Matching is This subparagraph will be expanded when matching is available. not currently funded.  68.8.  Investment  Options.  TSP  contributions  deducted  from  the  member's  pay  each  pay period (i.e. monthly) are forwarded by DFAS-DE, to the National Finance Center (NFC) in New Orleans, Louisiana. The NFC invests member contributions into the 'G' fund immediately upon receipt.   It is the member's responsibility to indicate to the NFC the contribution allocation if the member  desires  contributions  go to  funds other than the  "G"  fund.  There  are a total of  five (5) choices  available  to  members.  Information  on  all  five  funds  can  be  found  at  the  TSP  website mentioned in paragraph 68.2 above. 68.9.  Interfund  Transfers.  This  option  of  the  TSP  is  available  through  the  NFC  only.  DFAS  cannot  move  monies  already  contributed  by  the  member  from  one  investment  fund  to another.  This  is  a  member  self-service  option  and  is  between  the  member  and  the  NFC (see References in paragraph 68.2). 68.10.  Tax Information. 68.10.1.  The  dollar  amount  of  TSP  member  contributions  (tax  deferred)  is  limited  by  the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).  The current elective deferral limit (see IRC section 402(g)) is $11,000 for 2002, and legislation already allows an incremental increase of $1,000/yr to this limit, not to exceed $15,000 in CY 2006. 68.10.2.  Contributions from combat zone tax exempt pay (IRC section 415(c)) do not count toward  the  $11,000  tax  deferred  limit,  but  tax  exempt  contributions  plus  tax  deferred contributions  cannot exceed $40,000 for a  calendar  year.  Example:  member  contributes a $5,000 SRB to TSP in September and that puts his tax deferred total to $10,000 for calendar year  02.    In  October  2002,  the  member  is  in  a  CZTE  area  and  elects  career  status  bonus (CSB).  The  member's  $30,000  tax  free  CSB  makes the  total  contributed  $40,000  ($30,000 tax  exempt  plus  $10,000  tax  deferred).    Member  cannot  contribute  any  more  to  TSP  for 2002. 68.10.2.1.  Example:   Member  elects 7%  base  pay, 100% of  his  board  certification  pay (FID  19)  which  is  also  TSPable  as  a  special  pay  on  DJMS  Table  123.    (Look  at  the category code which equals ‘S’.)  Elects 100% of variable special pay (FID 24) which is also TSPable as a special pay as the category code also equals ‘S’. 1038 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 68.10.2.1.1.  Assuming  a  monthly  base  pay  rate  of  $4,696.20,  monthly  board  cert pay  of  $291.66,  and  a  monthly  entitlement  of  variable  special  pay  of  $916.66  the following is true:          4696.20 X 7%    =  328.72 291.66 X 100%  =  291.66 916.66 X 100%  =  916.66  =          $1,537.06 Monthly deferred TSP contribution 68.10.2.1.2.  $1,537.06 X 7 months  =  $10,759.42.  In the eight month the member will exceed the  current  (2002)  $11,000  deferred  limit  by  limit  by  $1,296.48  and  this amount  will  be returned to his pay. 68.10.2.1.3.  Now lets put this same member in a combat zone in the month of July, the  seventh  month  of  the  year,  and  see  how  his  deductions  are  to  be  displayed. There are  no changes to  his  contributions  percentages  and  a  change  in  pay  is  equal to  the  entitlement  of  imminent  danger  pay  of  $150/mo,  and  he  is  due  an  annual installment of additional special pay (ASP) of $15,000 in July. 68.10.2.1.4.  The TSP contributions are computed as follows: $1537.06 X 6  =  $9,222.36 TSP deferred contributions (Jan thru Jun) and here comes July. BP SP SP SP SP bonus.) 328.74 291.66 916.66 150.00 15,000.00  (This is an installment that is catagorized as spec pay vs 68.10.2.1.5.  The  member  will contribute 5,532.90 in  exempt TSP  contributions and $1,777.64 in deferred contributions. 68.10.2.1.6.  Keep  in  mind  that  the  member  has  a  $40,000  annual  TSP  exempt contribution  limit  when  in  a  combat  zone.  In  July  he  has  reached  his  $11,000 deferred  limit  and  has  a  total  of  $16,532.90  towards  the  $40,000  exempt  limit.   (The $11,000 is part of the $40,000.) 68.10.2.1.7.  The financial  services offices are not financial advisors and must allow the member to make his own financial decisions. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1039   68.11.  The  TSP  Loan  Process  is  Strictly  Between  the  Member  and  the  NFC.  Direct members  to  the TSP  website  for  questions  and  answers  and  to  NFC  for  loan  application  and processing  of  a  TSP  loan.  Members  may  have  a  total  of  two  loans  at  any  given  time  for  the following purposes: 68.11.1.  Residential (Limited to one) 68.11.2.  General Purpose (may have up to two) 68.11.2.1.  The  minimum  amount  a  member  can  borrow  is  $1000  and  the  maximum  is $50,000. Loan repayments are accomplished  by  payroll  deduction only and are  initiated by  NFC  via  data  transmission  to  DJMS.    DJMS-AC  uses  the  allotment  system  to withhold  the  deduction  amount  for  repayment  after  the  data  file  is  received  from  the NFC.  Neither DFAS nor the FSO can start or stop this type of allotment. 68.12.  Breakage.  By law, members are entitled to "breakage" on certain contributions that, as a result  of agency  error,  were  not  invested  when  they  should  have  been  (and  which  the  member did  not  otherwise  have  use  of).    Currently,  breakage  does  not  apply  until  the  contribution  is more  than 30 days late  being sent to NFC.  This process compensates members for agency error and must be requested via a claim process.   However,  members are not entitled  to breakage  on contributions  that  were  not  actually  deducted  from  their  pay,  but  they  may  be  entitled  to  make-up contributions.  Breakage is computed by NFC. 68.13.  Make-up Contributions.  Members are entitled to make-up contributions if the TSP form was not processed in a timely manner.  However, because the member had use of their money no breakage  will  be  paid.  Example:  member  has  elected  to  make  contributions  via  the  TSP-U-1, the  form  is  not  processed  in  a  timely  manner,  and  no  contributions  are  withheld  from  the member's pay.  The member had use of his money so no breakage is payable. 68.13.1.  In the case of a member who is participating in TSP, is entitled to a bonus, and has elected a percentage to  withhold  from  bonuses, but  for  some reason, the  bonus payment  is made later, the TSP attributable to the bonus should be applied to the month the bonus was earned,  not  the  month  paid.  For  members  who  are  entitled  to  combat  zone  tax  exclusion (CZTE),  this  is  a  recurring  problem.  Example:  Member  entitled  to  a  bonus  in  October 2006,  but  payment  is  delayed  (through  no  fault  of  the  member)  until  December  2006.  In October, the member was in a combat zone and, therefore, entitled to exempt contributions. 68.13.2.  Advise  the  member  to  write  a  check  to  cover  the  TSP  contribution  that  was  not withheld from his/her pay. Once the check is received by the finance office, establish a CMS case and refer it to the TSP box, advising that the check has been received and amount of the check.  Additionally,  due  to  the  nature  of  TSP,  call  DFAS-JMSB  as  soon  as  the  check  is received in finance so that DFAS has time (at least 2-3 days before cutoff) to send the funds to TSP on the member’s behalf and adjust the TSP and taxable wages for the month in which the member was paid. 68.14.  Error Corrections.  Error notification will be provided on the DTR to the input source as done currently, and will require research and re-input.  NFC rejects will be processed at central site.  These may require information/coordination with the member's servicing finance office. 1040 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 68.15.  Claims  Procedures.  Members  must  alert  their  Financial  Service  Office  (FSO)  of  any discrepancy  with  regards to  their  TSP  withholdings/earnings  within  one  year  of  notification  of the discrepancy.  As it is the member’s responsibility to read and validate the monthly leave and earnings statement the 1st notification received by the member would be the month in which the transaction should have occurred and didn’t, or occurred incorrectly. 68.15.1.  The  FSO  determines  the  member  is  making  a  claim  to  request  correction  of  an agency  error (versus an administrative  error).  If the  claim is  made  within  the required  one-year timeframe, the pay office  will  assist  member  in  completing  DD  FM 2851,  request  to correct  thrift  saving  plan  (TSP)  agency  error.    The  form  can  be  located  at  the  following:  http://www.dior.whs.mil/icdhome/form-info/wwwinfo1page2493.htm.   The  FSO  will forward  the  claim  form  to  DFAS-PMJFD/DE,  6760  E.  Irvington  Pl.,  Denver,  Colorado 80233-5000 for adjudication. 68.15.2.  The following are examples of agency errors for which a claim may be appropriate: 68.15.2.1.  The  member  enrolled  in  TSP  and  deductions  were  not  withheld,  a  different percentage amount was withheld, or the deduction was taken from a different category of pay than elected. 68.15.2.2.  In  the  case  of  the  member  receiving  his  semiannual  statement  from  the National Finance Center (NFC), the  statement  does not reflect  proper timely  posting  of contribution to the account. 68.15.2.3.  Member  elected to  stop  TSP  contributions  and  deductions  continued  beyond the first full pay period after receipt of the form. 68.15.3.  DFAS-DE  will  adjudicate  the  DD  FM  2851  within  approximately  30  days  of receipt. 68.15.3.1.  The  adjudication  process  will  be  performed  by  a  group  of  three  individuals designated  by  the  director  of  military  pay.    Two  of  the  group  will  be  from  other  than the TSP  operations office. 68.15.3.2.  The adjudication  group  convenes  each  month.   The  group  will review all forms  received  prior  to  that  month,  and  will  ensure  the  member,  FSO,  and DFS-PMJFD/DE is notified of the results. 68.15.3.3.  DFAS-PMJFD/DE will coordinate with the member when it’s determined that makeup contributions are valid and process the appropriate transaction(s). 68.15.4.  FSOs  are  required  to  keep  a  log,  by  calendar  year,  of  the  DD  FM  2851  sent  to DFAS  with  a  minimum  reference  to  the  member’s  name,  SSAN,  date  sent  and  brief description of the claim (from item 12 of the form). 68.16.  Owners  of  the  Program.  AF/DPRC,  ANG/DPF,  and  AF/REP  are  the  owners  of  this program. Please refer to  USAF  Uniformed  Services Thrift  Savings  Plan  implementing  policy message as referenced above.  The member's finance office is not to provide investment advice. 68.17.  Source and Method of Input.  There are 2 ways for a member’s TSP contributions to be updated. Members can control their TSP themselves by taking action in myPay. In the case of a member  who  does  not  have  access  to  myPay,  Finance  can  take  action  based  on  the documentation provided by the member. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1041  68.18.  FSO Responsibilities. 68.18.1.  Recommend  that the member access myPay and  process the  start, stop, change,  or cancel  transactions.    If  member  is  unable  to  access,  myPay,  provide  assistance  in  gaining access and follow procedures in 68.18.2 for the current request. 68.18.2.  Input TSP-U-1 information, for members unable to access myPay, using the D101, D102, D104, and D106 transactions (see figures 68-1, 68-2, 68-3, and 68-4).  See figure 68-5 for  TSP-U-1.    For  bases  that  have  cutover  to  the  AFFSC,  scan  the  TSP-U1  into  EIM  for AFFSC processing. 68.18.3.  To  collect  and  process  “Claim  for  Reimbursement  of  Thrift  Savings  Plan  (TSP) Breakage  and  Make-up  Contribution's”  from  the  member.    These  forms  and  required associated documents will be forwarded to DFAS for processing. 68.19.  Processing Form TSP-U-1.  To process TSP contribution elections: 68.19.1.  Ensure that the election was made properly. 68.19.1.1.  A  contribution  election  must  be  a  whole  percentage  and  cannot  exceed  the member contribution limit. 68.19.1.2.  The TSP-U-1 is the required source document. 68.19.1.3.  Ensure the member fills out sections I-IV and signs the form. 68.19.1.4.  Notify the member if the election cannot be processed. 68.19.2.  Establish the effective date of the election. 68.19.2.1.  If a member makes a contribution election during the initial (new accession) 60-day window, the agency must make it effective no later than the first  full pay period after the election is received. 68.19.2.2.  (DELETED) 68.19.2.3.  Inter-Service and Intra-Service transfers (see paragraph 68.6). 68.19.3.  Finance completes section V of the TSP-U-1: 68.19.3.1.  Block 17:  3800 0001 68.19.3.2.  Block  18:    see  paragraph  68.21.2;  effective  date  is  determined  by  date received in the finance office 68.19.3.3.  Block 19:  Required only if the member has completed section III of the form. Member  may  resume  contributing  during  the  next  open  season  if  contributions  are terminated WITHIN an open season; if outside an open season period, the member must wait until the second open season following termination of contributions. 68.19.3.4.  Block 20:  Service Representative’s signature accepting the TSP-U-1 form. 68.19.4.  Notify  the  member  of  the  effective  date  of  the  deduction  from  pay.    Ensure  the member  receives  a  copy  of  the  Form  TSP-U-1,  after  the  agency  completes  section  V,  “for employing office use only”.  Include the original in the quarterly document submission to the Denver Federal Records Center (records center handbook available on FTP site for reference) as required  in para  2.4.6  of this  manual,  and,  keep  the  FSO  retained  copy  for  at  least  six 1042 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 months.   Agencies  must  have  the  capability  to retrieve TSP information,  as it  may need to be provided to another service if a member transfers, or to an appropriate agency official if a member files a claim for error correction. 68.19.5.  Input  the  D1  transaction  and  verify  that  the  information,  as  input,  is  correct, using  the TSP-U-1.   Ensure  customer  service  reviews  and  verifies  that  the input  was  done correctly, to prevent breakage fees, claims, etc.  Any elections processed incorrectly must be re-input as soon as possible to prevent erroneous deductions. 68.19.6.  The  member  fills  out  a  new  TSP-U-1,  sections  I,  III  and  IV,  to  terminate contributions; finance completes section V. 68.20.  Separations/Retirement  Procedures.  Separation  and  retirement  transactions  should flow  automatically  from  current  transaction  processing.  However,  DJMS-AC  stops  TSP contributions the  month prior to the date of separation. If the member wants contributions to be withheld during the final month of active duty, establish a CMS case and refer it to the TSP box. Include the TSP contribution when performing the pay comp at separation and ensure the TSP is deducted before making final payment to the member. 68.21.  Definitions. 68.21.1.  “As of” date is used by payroll offices on payment records that report makeup and late contributions.  It is the pay date for which TSP contributions should have been made. 68.21.2.  The effective date of the contribution is posted in the start date field of the D101 and  is derived by the date the elections are received by the FSO.   For the current upcoming open season the following is true.  Member signs and submits the TSP  U-1 to FSO anytime from  15  October  through  30  November  and  the  FSO  submits  the  D101  for  update  of  the members  MMPA,  the  start  date  of  TSP  contributions  is  1  December.  If  submitted  to  FSO during  the  month  of  December  the  start  date  is  submitted  as  1  January.    No  starts  after January. 68.21.3.  Open Seasons: Open seasons were eliminated in 2005, but were previously 15 April thru 30 June and 15 October thru 31 December. 68.21.4.  Air Force Payroll Office Numbers:  - DFAS-DE 3800 0001 (AC) 3801 0001 (RC) 68.21.5.  Attributable pay date is used on negative adjustment records that remove erroneous contributions  previously  reported  and  on  recharacterization  records  which  change  the  tax characterization  of  contributions  previously  reported.    It  is  the  pay  date  of  the  original (erroneous  or  erroneously  characterized)  contribution  or,  if  the  original  contribution  was  a makeup or late contribution, the “as of” date for the original contribution. 68.21.6.  Current pay date is the service’s established pay date for its payroll submission.  It is reported on the header record, which accompanies the submission. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1043  68.21.7.  Employee contributions are TSP contributions that are deducted from compensation paid  to  uniformed  service  members.  See  TSP  Bulletin  01-U-3,  Uniformed  Services Participation in the Thrift Savings Plan, dated July 19, 2001, for information about the types of pay from which employee contributions may be deducted. 68.21.8.  Late  contributions  are  employee  contributions  that  were  timely  deducted  from  a member’s  pay  but  were  not  timely  reported  to  the  TSP  and,  if  applicable,  attributable matching  contributions;  and  resubmitted  contributions  that  may  have  been  reported  on time  but  were  not  processed  by  the  NFC  when  originally  reported  because  the  payment records contained errors. 68.21.9.  Makeup  contributions  are  contributions  that  should  have  been  deducted  from  a member’s  pay  (or, in the  case  of attributable  matching  contributions,  charged to a  service’s appropriation) on an earlier pay date but are being deducted (or charged) for the current pay date. 68.21.10.  Matching  contributions  are  contributions  made  by  the  uniformed  service  to the TSP accounts  of its  members  who are  entitled to  such  contributions.   See TSP Bulletin 01-U-3 for more information about matching contributions. 68.21.11.  Ordinary  tax-deferred  contributions  are  employee  contributions  that  are  made from  compensation  not  subject  to  the  Federal  income  tax  exclusion  at  26  U.S.C.  §112 (applicable  to  compensation  for  active  service  in  a  month  in  which  a  member  serves  in  a combat zone). 68.21.12.  Payroll  submission  is a  payroll office’s  entire  submission of one or  more records (Member Data Records and/or payment records) and the journal voucher (TSP-2). 68.21.13.  Recharacterization  is  the  correction  of  the  tax  characterization  (i.e.,  tax deferred  or tax-exempt) of employee contributions previously submitted. 68.21.14.  Tax-exempt  contributions  are  employee  contributions  that  are  made  from compensation  subject  to  the  Federal  income  tax  exclusion  at  26  U.S.C.  §112  applicable  to compensation for active service in the month in which a member serves in a combat zone. 68.21.15.  Posting  date:  is  the  date  transactions  are  credited  or  debited  to  a  participant’s account. 68.21.16.  Pay period – as defined by law 68.21.17.  Election period – is the last calendar month of the open season. 68.22.  Catch Up Contributions for TSP Participants Age 50 and Older. to   The  annual limitations their  TSP  accounts. 68.22.1.  Overview.    Pl  107-304,  27  Nov  2002,  permits  eligible  TSP  participants,  who  are age 50 or older,  to  make  tax-deferred  ‘catch-up’  contributions  from  their  taxable  basic pay 2003  =  $2,000;  2004  =  $3,000;  2005  =$4,000;  2006  and  after  =  $5,000.    Because  these contributions  must  be  made  from  pre-tax  dollars,  catch-up  contributions  cannot  be  made from  basic  pay  that  has  been  excluded  from  taxation  due  to  service  in  a  combat  zone.  These contributions must be made through payroll deduction.  Participants can make, change, or stop a catch-up election at any time, beginning in or after the year in which they turn age 50 (not subject to open season rules).  Elections are made in whole dollar amounts, up to the for  contributions  are:    1044 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 yearly  limit.  Because  the  annual  limits  change  each  year,  the  member  must  make  a  new election each calendar year.  An election can be made effective 1 August 2003 and later. 68.22.2.  Eligibility.    A  member  must  be  in  pay  status  and  must  be  contributing,  either  the maximum TSP  contribution  percentage  of  basic  pay,  or  an  amount  which  will  result  in  his or her reaching the IRS deferral limit by the end of the relevant year.  The member must be at least 50 years old in the year the catch-up contributions are made.  The member must not be in the  6-month  non-contribution  period  following  receipt  of  a  financial  hardship  in-service withdrawal. NOTES: 1.   A member who is currently contributing to both civilian and uniformed services TSP accounts  can  make   separate   catch-up  contributions  to  each  account,  so  long  as the  total  for  both  accounts  combined  does  not  exceed  the  annual  catch-up  limit.  NFC  will  check  for  excess  contributions  and  will  contact  the  member  directly  if excess contributions have been made. 2.    A  member,  who  makes  catch-up  contributions  to  the  TSP  and  a  private  sector pension  plan,  must  ensure  that  the  contributions,  made  to  both  plans  combined, do  not  exceed  the  annual  catch-up  limit.   If  a  member  does  exceed  the  limit,  he or  she  may request a  refund  of  the excess contributions directly from NFC. 68.22.3.  FSO Actions.   Process starts/stops immediately.   Ensure member has an open M0 on  the  MMPA.    TSP  catch-up  workaround  is  to  process  a  DS01  debt  transaction  (see Figure 70.13 for the DS01 format).  Follow normal DS01 processing with exceptions as noted below: FIRST SCREEN: APPROP-CODE-DEPT [57] “57” FOR AIR FORCE     AMT-SPEC-INDEBT [ ] TOTAL AMOUNT ELECTED FOR CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR (CY) (FOUND  ON  THE  TSP-U-1-C  (0  FILL  TO THE  LEFT))  CANNOT  BE  MORE  THAN $2000 FOR CY 2003 AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MOQ[ ] MONTHLY AMOUNT REQUIRED TO REACH TOTAL AMOUNT ELECTED IN AMT-SPEC-INDEBT FIELD ABOVE AND TIMEFRAME REQUIRED INDEBT-TYPE [H] ‘H’ USED FOR TSP CATCH-UP     AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1045 SECOND SCREEN:     APPROP-CODE [57 F38827001] LEAVE BLANK ALL REMAINING FIELDS ON THIS SCREEN ADSN [380100] 68.22.4.  TSP  Catch-up  is  posted  to  DJMS  as  a  DS  debt,  Type  H.    The  TSP  website  is manually  updated  to  reflect  as  a  late  payment,  retroactive  to  the  month  prior.  The contributions accrue interest, effective as of the end-of-month deducted. 68.22.5.  DJMS updates taxable wages each  month, with the exception of December and the month the statutory limit is reached, to reflect the catch-up contributions.  The wages for the month the member reaches the statutory limit are updated manually, posting after month-end restructure, and the taxes are refunded during that next month.  DFAS also manually updates the  taxable  wages  for  the  year-to-date  to  include  December's  contribution,  but  that  isn't accomplished until after year-end, so no refunds are made.  For those members who deposit all  of  their  catch-up  contributions  in  December,  the  taxes  withheld  on  the  amounts  that should have been deferred will only be available upon filing their tax returns. 68.23.  Address Changes. 68.23.1.  Separatees. If the individual has separated, he/she can complete a change of address by going to TSP.gov and selecting "Your TSP Address (for separated participants only)." 68.23.2.  Members. For members still in the Air Force, but not currently participating in TSP, address changes must be accomplished by DFAS-JMSB/DE. When a member requests a new PIN,  it  is  mailed  to  the  existing  address  in  the  TSP  account  record.  If  the  current  mailing address  is  incorrect,  the  member  must  request  an  address  change  before  requesting  a  new PIN. The FSO establishes a CMS case and refers it to the TSP box, indicating the need for a change of address 1046 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 68.1.

The  general  policy  is  that  members  indebted  to  the  United  States  will  be encouraged to discharge their debts through lump-sum cash payments when possible.  Otherwise members will be encouraged to voluntarily accept liability for their indebtedness and to agree to make  periodic  cash  partial  payments.    Collection  of  debts  by  payroll  deduction  should  be  as  a last resort. 69.2.  Validity  of  Debt.  The  FSO  determines that  collection  for the  debt  is  valid and required supporting documentation is received for collection.  Any FSO may process a valid indebtedness on a member's pay account.  However, a copy of the indebtedness package must be forwarded to the member's servicing FSO. 69.3.  Notification  of  Indebtedness.  The  member  must  be  notified  of  the  debt  by  the  activity holding the debt.  See paragraph 69.6.8 for details on the three types of debts and definitions of proper  notification  required  for  each  type.    The  FSO  is  only  required  to  provide  the  member written notification of the debt when the documentation shows the member has not been notified of  the  debt.    If  in  doubt,  always  notify  the  member  in  writing.    The  FSO  need  not  notify  the member  of  the  debt  when  specific  procedures  require  the  activity  to  notify  the  member,  for example,  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES),  non-appropriated fund instrumentalities (NAFI). 69.4.  Repayment  of  Indebtedness.  The  activity  generating  the  debt  is  responsible  for providing  notification  of  the  existence  of  the  debt  and  due  process  to  the  debtor.    Initial notification will include a demand for immediate payment in full of the debt.  When the member is  financially  unable  to  pay  the  debt  in  one  lump  sum,  payment  may  be  accepted  in  regular installments.  A member who is unable to pay the debt in one lump sum must submit a written request,  with  the  appropriate  endorsements  and  attachments,  to  the  applicable  approving authority  shown  in  Table  69.2..    The  general  policy  is  the  installment  payment  should  bear  a reasonable relation to the amount of the debt and the member's ability to pay and be sufficient to protect  the  interest  of  the  United  States  Government.    See  paragraph  69.7  for  maximum monthly deduction amounts. 69.4.1.  The  repayment  must  be  completed  the  month  prior  to  the  member’s  Date  of Separation  (DOS).    The  FSO  has  the  authority  to  establish  a  repayment  for  12  months (maximum) or a minimum of $50 per month; however, this should be the exception and not the rule.  Never use a monthly collection lower than $50 or more than a 12 month repayment.  Collections  must  be  processed  on  the  member’s  ability  to  pay  and  not  just  an  automatic repayment of 12 months or $50 per month. If the member disagrees with the repayment rate establish by the FSO, the member must provide an approved financial hardship to justify the different collection rate.  See the DoDFMR,  Volume 5  for the  criteria on an undue  financial hardship.  Approval levels in table 69-2 apply. 69.4.2.  Payment in full may be made in cash or by agreement to an immediate deduction of the full debt amount from available net pay.  Notification of voluntary salary offset requires the  debtor's  written  authorization  specifying  the  amount  to  be  paid  and  the  office  and/or AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1067  company  code  to  receive  the  payment.    Creditor  activities  obtaining  written  authorizations for voluntary salary offsets will forward the original and one copy to the member's servicing FSO. 69.5.  Repayment  Based  on  Remission.  A  repayment  of  a  debt  will  be  established  by SAF/MRB  when  a  member  has  had  a  remission  denied  or  partially  approved.    The  repayment schedule established by SAF/MRB for the denied amount may remain in effect until the debt is satisfied,  the  member  has  reached  the  month  prior  to  the  Date  of  Separation  (DOS),  or  it  is determined  by  the  FSO  that  an  increase  to  the  repayment  amount  would  benefit  the  Air  Force (i.e. debt will not be collected prior to the DOS). 69.6.  General Collection Guidance. 69.6.1.  Indebtedness  by  a  member  is  generally  collected  under  statutory  authorities,  each having unique limits and procedures.  See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 50. 69.6.1.1.  Title  37  U.S.C.  1007c.    Used  to  collect  debts  to  DoD  or  other  Uniformed Services.  The two-thirds rule applies. 69.6.1.2.  Title  5  U.S.C.  5514.    Used  to  collect  debts  to  non-DoD  federal  agencies.  Collection is limited to 15 percent of disposable pay with no acceleration allowed prior to separation. 69.6.2.  See paragraph 69.7 for monthly collection amounts. 69.6.3.  If the member has a debt, but no pay available for collection, the FSO must process the  start  transaction  and  establish  a  repayment  schedule  to  begin  collection  when  pay  is available.  The computer will suspend the debt entry until pay is available. 69.6.4.  When the FSO is adjusting the repayment schedule on a DV entry, the new payment schedule may not exceed 24 months' collection for the total debt. 69.6.5.  When  establishing  a  repayment  schedule,  always  round  to  the  highest  dollar.    The FSO  can  establish  the  repayment  for  a  maximum  of  12  months  or  a  minimum  of  $50 collection per month never to exceed a 12 month repayment.  Do not establish a repayment rate less than $50 per month. 69.6.6.  When the Air Force has been requested to collect a debt owed to a non-DoD federal agency and the  creditor agency  has  certified that  the debt is valid and that due  process  has been provided, DoD  policy  prohibits  the FSO  from unilaterally  suspending  debt  collection.  DFAS  will provide  specific procedures  for  FSO use in assisting  debtors to resolve disputes regarding debts to such agencies. 69.6.7.  FSOs  should  not  process  DD  Forms  139  requesting  involuntary  pay  offset  unless creditor  organization  prepared  forms  contain  the  following  statement:    "Member  has  been provided due  process  in accordance  with  DoDFMR,  Volume 7A,  paragraph 500104a," or a signed  consent  agreement  is  attached  to  the  DD  Form  139.    Debts  created/processed  by DFAS  will  require  official  notification.    Household  Good/trailer  shipment  debts  will  be processed  by  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF  and  require  no  notification  by  the  FSO;  however,  if  no action is taken by the member, action should be taken to start collection. 69.6.8.  Debts which can be collected under 37 USC 1007C (Refer to DoDFMR 7A, Chapter 50)  are  divided  into  three  categories:    Adjustments  of  $100  or  less,  routine  adjustments  of 1068 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 greater than $100, and debts requiring due process.  Any debt over $100 requires the member be notified  of the  debt in  writing and  given 30 days to respond.   This applies to all  system generated  debts  from  retro  processing,  or  overpayments  discovered  by  the  FSO,  DFAS  or other agencies.     All  debts  created  by  the  system  will  generate a  management  notice to the FSO which they will use to start the official due process. 69.6.8.1.  Adjustments  of  $100  or  less  (no  notification  is  required).    Such  adjustments, regardless  of  when  discovered,  collected,  or  how  created,  will  be  treated  the  same  as routine adjustments for collection purposes.  The member will be provided with notice of collection when it is made, or as soon thereafter as practical, normally via the LES.  No official debt notification is required. 69.6.8.2.  Routine  adjustments  greater  than  $100  (notification  required).    A  routine adjustment  collects  an  overpayment  resulting  from  clerical  or  administrative  errors, delays  in  processing  pay  documents,  or  an  automated  pay  system  error,  which  is discovered and collected within no more than two monthly pay periods after the date of overpayment.    Even  though  the  member  has  notification  on  their  LES  that  a  debts  has been established, the member must be provided with at least 30 days written notification before  collection  can  begin..  Adjustments  of  greater  than  $100  created  by  a  retro transactions,  will  be  suspended  by  the  system  and  will  automatically  start  collection  in the second processing month after the processing month in which the debt was processed.  If the member is filing a remission, take action to suspend the collection.  If no remission is  being  filed  or the  member  does  not respond to the  notification,  start  collection action after  the  30  days.      If  a  waiver  is  being  done  by  the  member,  start  collection  action  as only  DFAS  can  suspend  collection  for  a  waiver.  This  means  that  the  member  and servicing FSO  will have information (LES remark and  management notice) regarding a pending  collection  from  the  member’s  pay  before  the  automatic  debt  collection  begins.  This provides another opportunity on top of the official written notification from the FSO for  the  member  to  correct  any  errors,  request  a  different  repay  schedule  or  file  a waiver/remission.  Whether such a repayment schedule is granted will be at the discretion of  the  Air  Force.    If  the  repayment  schedules  are  not  changed,  the  system  will automatically collect the debt. 69.6.8.3.  Debts  greater  than  $100  that  require  formal  notification  to  the  member  in  the form of a due process letter from the servicing FSO.  These are debts that are discovered by  the  FSO,  DFAS  or  other  agencies.    Initiate  formal  due  process  and  suspend  the collection for 30 days.  If the member fails to respond to the notification, start collection action immediately. 69.6.9.  Current  month  overpayments.    Entitlement  overpayments  identified  during  the current month are not scheduled as debts when the member’s current EOM pay is adequate to collect the overpayment using the two-thirds rule.  The member’s pay will be automatically adjusted to eliminate the overpayment during EOM payment processing. 69.6.10.  “No pay due” (NPD) notice.  As a precaution to prevent avoidable hardship to the member, a “no pay due” management notice will be generated to the servicing finance office when  a  debt  creates  a  “No  pay  due”  situation  for  that  member.    Immediately  view  the member’s MMPA to determine why the member is NPD, take appropriate action (if any) and notify the member. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1069  69.6.11.  Separation.  When a member is expected to be separated within the next ninety (90) days, the system accelerates entitlement - related debt collection to collect all available funds prior to  separation.  However, if  it is a retroactive adjustment of over $100 the  system  will suspend and the FSO will have to initiate the collection action.  A management notice will be created. 69.7.  Monthly Collection Amount. 69.7.1.  Fault  of  the  Member.    An  overpayment  of  pay  and  allowances  determined  to  be caused by fault of the member will be recovered in monthly installments not to exceed 2/3rds of the member’s disposable monthly pay.  The FSO will provide due process notification to the member after receipt of the  management notice.  See the  DoDFMR, Volume 7, Chapter 50, for disposable pay. 69.7.2.  No Fault by the Member.  An overpayment of pay and allowances determined to be no fault by the member, will be collected in monthly installments not to exceed 20% of the member’s  disposable  pay  for  that  month. The FSO  will  provide  due  process notification to the member after receipt of the management notice.   A greater collection percentage may be deducted with the member’s consent. 69.7.3.  Combat Zone/Combat Operation Debts.  Debts incurred by members who are injured or  wounded  while  entitled  to  Hostile  Fire/Imminent  Danger  Pay  under  37  U.S.C. 310(a)(2)(c)  or  while  in  the  line  of  duty,  incur  a  wound,  injury,  or  illness  in  a  combat operation or combat zone designated by the Secretary of Defense, will not be deducted from the  member’s  pay  until  the  end  of  the  90-day  period  beginning  on  the  date  on  which  the member is notified of the overpayment, or such earlier date as may be requested or agreed to by the member.  The FSO will determine whether collection will be at 2/3rds or 20% of the member’s monthly pay. 69.7.4.  Allotments  must  be taken  into consideration  when  computing a  member's one-third pay and the 20% rate of collection.  The stopping of allotments should  be done in the order specified  by the  member.   If the  member  does  not  specify any  specific  order, the  voluntary allotments  such as  bonds,  charity, and assistance  fund  should be  stopped  first,  followed  by savings  allotments.    Insurance  allotments  should  be  stopped  last.    The  member  must  be notified when any allotments are stopped. 69.7.5.  Dishonored commissary checks are not subject to the two-thirds rule. 69.8.  Accelerating  Collection  of  Debts.  When  the  FSO  is  notified  a  member  is  pending separation,  the  master  military  pay  account  (MMPA)  must  be  checked  to  determine  the collection status of any debt.  Any debt which will not be collected by date of separation (DOS) must be reviewed and collection increased per DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 50.  Process an 04 (change) transaction to  increase  the  current  monthly  deduction  to  ensure  collection by DOS  for any debt (except tax levies and Title 5 U.S.C. 5514 debts from non-DoD federal agencies (salary offset)) which cannot exceed a collection rate of 15 percent of disposable pay. 69.9.  Management  Case  File  (MCF).  All  indebtedness  documentation,  including  DD  Forms 139, rebuttal letters, remission, and waiver applications are to be kept in a management case file set up by the FSO.  The documentation is retained per Air Force Records Disposition Schedule.  When  the  member  goes  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS),  documentation  on  open  or 1070 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 suspended  debts  must  be included in the PCS package.    An MCF  will  be  established  for every indebtedness processed against the member. 69.10.  Management Notices. 69.10.1.  When a retroactive entitlement stop, non-pay status, or grade reduction is posted to a  member's  MMPA  causing  the  member  to  be  in  debt,  the  FSO  receives  an  XY03 management notice describing the debt and the computer generated repay rate.  The FSO can change the repayment rate if the action indicator is Q8 by processing a DQ20.  If the action indicator is  not Q8 the FSO  processes a DQ04  with the  new repay rate.    If this is a  newly establish debt, the member must be given due process in writing if the debt is over $100. 69.10.2.  When the member has a computer-generated debt collecting and receives a net pay increase of over $99.99, an XY03 management notice is generated to the FSO.  The FSO can process a DQ04 to increase the repay rate after notifying the member. 69.10.3.  When a computer-generated  debt is activated because  of  pay  now  being available, the FSO receives an XD03 management notice.  This notice is normally produced on the first update of the next month but can be produced when the member's MMPA receives additional funds and the computer activates a suspended debt ahead of schedule.  If the additional funds are one  time, the  debt  stays active  (Q1)  even though  no  further  deduction  will occur.   The FSO must control the collection restart when funds are available by processing a DQ04.  An XD03  management  notice  is  also  produced  if  DFAS  processes  a  DQ01.    The  FSO  will suspend this debt pending notification to the member. 69.10.4.  When a  member  separates  with a  debt, an  XS03 is  produced to  the  FSO  showing the total amount of all the open and  suspended  debts  except DVs.  The amount includes all open debts on the MMPA that cannot be collected from final pay before DOS as well as any debt to be created because of excess leave, recoupment of bonus, etc. 69.11.  Suspended Transactions. 69.11.1.  A  DQ,  DR  or  DS  indebtedness  may  be  suspended  as  action  indicator  18  by processing  a  DQ01,  DR01  or  DS01  transaction  with  a  suspension  reason  code  or  by processing a DQ18, DR18 or DS18 transaction against an open entry.  The suspended entry may only be opened by processing the applicable transaction with action indicator 20 or 21.  The  DQ18  and  DR18  transactions  will  not  process  against  entries  which  have  an  action indicator  equal  to  Q8,  18,  20  or  21.    A  DS18  transaction  will  not  process  against  entries which  have  an  action  indicator  equal  to  Q8,  20,  or  21,  but  will  process  against  action indicator  18.    Send  a  message  to  DFAS  for  action  stating  all  facts  if  the  entry  needs  to  be suspended  again  if  DR,  DS,  or  DQ.    Debts  will  only  be  suspended  to  give  the  member  30 days notification, if member filed a remission, or if the validity of the debt is in question.  If the  debt  has  been  suspended  for  more  than  30  days  and  no  remission  has  been  filed, collection action must start. 69.11.2.  A  DG  indebtedness  entry  may  be  suspended  with  action  indicator  18  only  by processing  a  start  transaction  (action  indicator  01  with  at  least  a  3-month  repayment schedule) and then processing a DG18 transaction.  The suspended entry may only be opened by processing a transaction with action indicator 20 or 21.  Action indicator 18 transactions will not process against entries which have an action indicator Q8, 18, 20, or 21.  Establish a AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1071  CMS case to DFAS for action stating all facts if the entry needs to be suspended again.  Do not suspend collection action on education debts or debts to DECA, NAF etc. 69.11.3.  An  indebtedness  entry  with  action  indicator  Q8  signifies  a  computer  generated suspension for no available pay unless the entry is a DV or DW.  A DV or DW entry may be suspended for no available pay or collection not to begin until the next month. 69.11.4.  The  FSO  may  open  an  entry  with  action  indicator  Q8  by  processing  a  resume transaction (action indicator 20). 69.12.  Cancellation of Indebtedness. 69.12.1.  A DG or DS indebtedness entry may only be canceled (action indicator 06) by FSO input, if the cancellation transaction is processed in the same month as the entry was started on the MMPA and the MMPA entry is still open.  The FSO may not generate a refund of a prior month deduction by processing a cancellation transaction. 69.12.2.  A DQ indebtedness entry may be canceled by the FSO, even though a prior month deduction has been made and the DQ is still open.  If the DQ entry was computer generated, the transaction which created the DQ  must be canceled, but a DQ06 will not process.  If the FSO has problems canceling a DQ, send a CMS case to DFAS for assistance. 69.12.3.  If a DG or DS entry was erroneously started and a prior month deduction has been made, the FSO must send a CMS case to DFAS requesting cancellation, stating all pertinent facts. 69.12.4.  A  refund  will  not  be  made  for  a  prior  month  deduction  if  the  member  decides  to submit a rebuttal letter or remission application after the 30-day notification.  Any refund due for a rebuttal letter will be made after adjudication if applicable.  If the cancellation is for a rebuttal  letter  or  remission  application,  the  FSO  must  include  in  the  message  request  to DFAS, the date of the letter notification to the member and the date of the member's rebuttal letter or remission application. 69.13.  Collection at Separation or Retirement. 69.13.1.  When an  officer is indebted at time  of  separation  or retirement,  collect  from  final pay, unpaid pay and allowances,  separation payments (except  donation), amounts  deducted for  United  States  Savings  Bonds,  separation travel  allowance,  reimbursement  for transportation  of  household goods, and  dislocation and  trailer allowance to satisfy the debt.  The  officer is not  entitled to  one-third  of  his  or  her pay and  partial  payments are not to  be made to offset collection. 69.13.2.  When  an  enlisted  member  is  indebted  at  time  of  separation  or  retirement,  collect from  final pay unpaid pay and allowances,  separation  payments (except donation), amounts deducted  for  United  States  savings  bonds,  reimbursement  for  transportation  of  household goods, dislocation and trailer allowance, and pay detained by courts-martial sentence or non-judicial punishment to satisfy the debt. 69.13.3.  Debts incurred  by  dependents  of  officers  or  enlisted  members to  the  United States or its instrumentalities may not be collected from final pay without the written consent of the member. 1072 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 69.13.4.  When a remission application is  pending,  contact the  Air  Force Financial  Services Center (AFFSC) Remission section  for a  determination before  making  the final payment to the  member.   The  AFFSC  Remission  section  may  be  contacted,  via  email,  at affsc.remission@ellsworth.af.mil  or,  via  phone,  at  DSN  675-8000,  commercial  (605)385-8000.  If a determination has been made, include in the final payment any amount remitted.  If a determination has not been made, deduct the amount of the debt from the final payment. 69.14.  Collection After Separation. 69.14.1.  DS debts  with type  codes  equal  to 2, 5, B,  E,  F, H, L,  M,  N,  or  V   will  be  closed when the MMPA goes into a T-reason 3, 5, or 7 or V status. 69.14.2.  Miscellaneous (DS) debts with type codes equal to 6, A, C, D, G, J, K, P, Q, R, S, and U will remain open and will be transferred to Debt and Claims. 69.14.3.  Collection  of  other  than  DS  debts  at  separation.    A  debt  remaining  at  separation, after collection of final pay, will be liquidated by collecting any amounts due the member for transportation  of  dependents,  shipment  of  personal  property,  and  separation  travel  (officers only).  Although an enlisted member's initial payment (advance) for separation travel cannot be collected to satisfy a debt, any amount due for separation travel following completion of such travel is available for offset. 69.14.3.1.  Military  Pay  will  notify  Travel  of  the  amount  of  the  debt  and  the  member's DOS  for  annotating  the  record  of  travel  payments.    If  the  debt  is  not  posted  to  the MMPA, process the appropriate indebtedness transaction. 69.14.3.2.  Travel  will  notify  Military  Pay  when  a  member  is  owed  amounts  and  the record of travel payments  shows the member has a debt.  Military Pay will then contact DFAS-IN to determine the status of the debt. 69.14.3.3.  If the debt is  still owed, Travel  will prepare  SF 1081, Voucher  and  Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, for collection of the debt.  A copy of SF 1081 is forwarded to Military  Pay  for processing a C203 transaction.    Make  sure the  debt is  posted to the MMPA before processing the C203 transaction. 69.15.  Appropriation Data.  No DS debts will be processed using an appropriation.  For travel debts, use the FSO D Company code, if not cut-over, and if cut-over, the company code for the FSO at the AFFSC is used.  For other than travel-related DS debts, use the base-level company code (FSO or creditor organization on the base if available) whether cutover or not.  See chapter 70 for more detailed information concerning DS debts. 69.16.  Detail Supporting JUMPS Miscellaneous Deductions Report (PCN UH099C187).  At the  end  of  every  month,  DFAS  mails  a  check  and  report  to  each  miscellaneous  indebtedness company  code  for  which  a  deduction  was  made  from  a  member's  pay  record.    The  deductions processed  were  requested  on  a  DD  Form  114,  Military  Pay  Order;  DD  Form  139,  Pay Adjustment  Authorization,  or  some  other  authorized  collection  document.    The  following procedures should be used to process the check and report received: 69.16.1.  Receipt  of  Check.    The  check  is  received  by  paying  and  collecting  and  deposited into  57F3875,  Budget  Clearing  Account  (Suspense)  Air  Force,  if  the  funds  will  not  be collected  into  the  applicable  appropriation  the  same  business  day.    If  the  check  is  for  SF 1219, Statement of Accountability, see paragraph 69.16.9 below. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1073   69.16.2.  Receipt of Report.  Military Pay notifies (or  forwards report, if appropriate, to) the applicable subject matter area (SMA) as shown below: Debt Type D G K L P U   SMA   See paragraph 69.18.9   Travel   DD Form 139 originator   Materiel   Travel   FM/ALO 69.16.2.1.  The  SMA  annotates  the  report  with  the  accounting  classification.    See paragraph 69.16.5 below if the accounting classification cannot be determined. 69.16.3.  Collection of Funds  -- Suspense Account.  If the check was immediately deposited to  the  FSO's  suspense  account,  except  for  SF  1219  receivables,  each  SMA  prepares  an  SF 1081, Voucher and Schedule of Withdrawals and Credits, for their funds.  No check or cash payment is made based on the SF 1081.  (See DoDFMR Volume 5, paragraph 8-11a(3).) 69.16.4.  Collection  of Funds  -- Non-Suspense  Account.  If the  check  was not immediately deposited  to  the  FSO's  suspense  account,  each  SMA  involved  prepares  a  DD  Form  1131, Cash  Collection  Voucher,  for  their  funds.    More  than  one  member  and  accounting classification can appear on the DD Form 1131.  (See DoDFMR Volume 5, paragraphs 7-15 and 7-21.) 69.16.5.  Unidentified Funds.   If, after research,  no  fund  citation  or cause  for receipt of the collection  can  be  found,  contact  input-ADSN  in  the  applicable  MMPA  DS  entry  for assistance.    If  the  input-ADSN  is  equal  to  spaces,  the  FSO  should  contact  the  member's servicing FSO for assistance.  The servicing FSO can identify the input source from the DTR or the JDC output products corresponding to the DS entry's EOD.  In addition, a copy of the source document for the DS entry should be maintained in the servicing FSO's management case file (MCF).  FSO's may not return the entire check or a portion of the check.  This also includes rejecting by others transactions through the MAFR system.  Any funds returned to DFAS will be returned without action.  If, after completely researching the matter, including contacting the member's servicing FSO, assistance is still needed, contact DFAS. 69.16.6.  Wrong Company Code.  If the FSO inputs its own company code in error instead of another  FSO's  company  code,  Military  Pay  prepares  an  SF  1047,  Public  Voucher  for Refunds,  for  a  check  to  be  issued  to  the  correct  recipient.    (See  DoDFMR  Volume  5, paragraphs 8-5 and 8-7.)  Send a copy of all documentation with the check.  That portion of the  check  must  first  be  deposited  to  the  FSO's  suspense  account.    If  the  deduction  is continuing, input a DS04 transaction to change the company code. 69.16.7.  Wrong  Accounting  Appropriation.    If  the  FSO  input  the  wrong  appropriation, DFAS  will  cancel  or  stop  the  DS  entry  and  re-input  a  DS01  transaction  with  the  company code of the FSO which input the original transaction. 1074 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 69.16.8.  Suspense  Account.    Do  not  hold  up  processing  the  collection  forms  to  obtain  an accounting classification.  Process all vouchers except the unidentified accounts and leave in or post the latter to the FSO's suspense account.  Follow procedures in this paragraph when the accounts are identified. 69.16.9.  SF  1219  Receivables.    These  receivables  concern  double  payments  (original  and substitute  checks  both  cashed  by  the  member),  dishonored  checks,  and  check  issue overpayments.  They are established on the SF 1219 on the basis of debit vouchers or advices of check issue discrepancies.  When the check is received from DFAS, that portion pertaining to SF 1219 receivables, indebtedness-code D, is deposited to the credit of the Treasurer of the United States and is recorded on SF 1219 as an increase in confirmed deposits and a decrease to the receivable.  Do not process a collection voucher.  Enter such collections into the FSO's suspense account only when collection is made before establishment of the receivable  on the SF 1219. 69.16.10.  Retaining  Report.    Military  Pay  retains  the  report  for  use  the  following  month.  This speeds up identifying the accounting classification for the same members appearing on the previous month's report. 69.17.  Open or Suspended Questionable Indebtedness. 69.17.1.  Obtaining report.  A copy of the report can be obtained through the Sysout Archive Retrieval  System  (SAR).    It  is  produced  every  quarter  and  is  in  ADSN  order.    The FA0847QQ contains both the questionable and suspended debts. 69.17.1.1.  Mode JFAFSO, Report # FA0847QQ, Debts Open Questionable 69.17.1.2.  Mode JFAFSO, Report # FA0847QT, Suspended Debts. 69.17.2.  Return of the report.  One copy of the report must be returned to DFAS via email, to the AFMPOCALLS@dfas.mil email address by the suspense date established by message, with  an  info  copy  to  your  MAJCOM.    Each  report  must  be  annotated  with  the  appropriate action taken on each debt.  If appropriate action was not taken, DFAS will contact the FSO and MAJCOM for assistance. 69.18.  Appeal. 69.18.1.  To appeal  the  validity of any  debt  shown  below,  the  member prepares, addresses, and  presents  to  his  or  her commander (except  for  69.18.2 below) a  signed statement in two copies.  It should include: 69.18.1.1.  Identification of charge against member's account. 69.18.1.2.  Member's reason for protesting debt. 69.18.1.3.  Evidence  refuting  debt,  including  documents,  receipt,  correspondence,  and description  of  circumstances  or  events  for  which  verifying evidence  is not available.  If member  has  evidence  not  immediately  available,  describe  it  and  state  when  it  can  be furnished.    Member  should  identify  dates,  official  designations  or  organizations,  and other information as exactly as possible. 69.18.2.

Generally, any indebtedness may be considered for remission except fines and forfeitures. 69.19.1.  Suspend  collection of the debt  effective the  current processing  month after receipt of the completed remission application.  Under no circumstances is the debt to be suspended based on oral request of the member or an incomplete remission application.  If the member does  not  submit the application  within the 30 days notice, collection action is to  be  started.  Collection action will then be suspended when the remission application is submitted.  Any amount previously collected will not be refunded or subject to remission. 69.19.2.  Upon adjudication of the remission application, AFFSC Remissions will process the applicable action indicator 20 or 21 transaction and  notify the FSO and  member,  via email message, of the results of the remission. 69.20.  Waiver.  Pertains  to  a  waiver  of  claims  for  erroneous  payments  of  a  member  of  the uniformed services arising out of an erroneous payment of pay or allowances (including travel or transportation allowance) may be considered for waiver.  All waivers are handled by DFAS -IN and  will  not  be  sent  to  the  AFFSC  for  processing.    The  debt  may  not  be  suspended  unless notified  by  DFAS-JFEAB/IN.    A  copy  of  waiver  application  must  be  maintained  in  the management case file.  See Chapter 73 for procedures on submission of waiver application. 69.21.  Claim.  A member may submit a claim to the GAO for a refund of an amount previously collected  for  excess  cost  of  a  shipment  of  personal  property.    See  Chapter  74  for  submission procedures.

Indebtedness won't be paid by date of separation (DOS).  Indebtedness not suspended and not collecting. Suspended DV or DW. EXPLANATION Deduction current month is less than the $50.00 minimum deduction established by DFAS.  Specific indebtedness divided by current month deduction is more than 12 months repay.  Current month deduction will not permit debt to be collected by DOS.  Debt entry is open with a current month deduction of zero. Collection of a partial, casual, or advance pay debt is suspended. FSO ACTION Determine why deduction is less than the $50.00.  Process a change (action indicator 04) to increase the deduction amount.  Annotate the listing with the DJMS update number on which the transaction processed.  If repayment was based on a remission and it is determined that an increase would benefit the Air Force, increase the monthly repayment accordingly.  Annotate the listing with the date of the remission approval.    Determine approval level for deduction amount.  Process a change (action indicator 04) transaction to increase deduction amount unless repay was approved  in accordance with Table 69-2.  Repayment amounts may be increased by the FSO if it is determined it would benefit the Air Force or if the debt will not be collected before the member’s DOS.  If the FORMAT-ID and action indicator is DV05, annotate the listing with the start date of the original entry.  Annotate the listing with approval level when other than the FSO and with the DJMS update number on which the change transaction processed.  Determine approval level for deduction amount.  Process a change (action indicator 04) transaction to increase deduction amount. Annotate the listing with the DJMS update number on which the transaction is processed.  If the deduction is not increased because member is reenlisting, annotate the listing with the date of the member's reenlistment.  Process a change (action indicator 04) transaction to establish a current month deduction and begin collection.  Annotate the listing with the DJMS update number on which the change transaction processed. Determine reason for suspension.  If action indicator is Q8, determine member's correct status.  If correct status allows accrual of pay, take action to collect debts by stopping allotments, terminating partial pay, etc.  If correct status does not allow accrual of pay, annotate listing with correct status.  If action indicator is 18, contact DFAS to have collection taken. Table 69.2.  REPAYMENT APPROVAL LEVEL (EXCEPT ADANCE PAY).

Description.  This  chapter  contains  information  on  the  following  types  of  indebtedness:  Report  of  Survey,  Pay  and  Allowances,  Shipment  of  Personal  Property,  Advance,  Casual  and Partial Payments, Compensation received from non-government sources, Jury Duty and Witness fees and Miscellaneous Debts to the Air Force. 70.2.  Report  of  Survey.  A  member may become indebted  to the  United  States  by  being  held pecuniarily liable for government property lost, damaged, or destroyed. 70.2.1.  If the  member  voluntarily agrees to reimburse the government by  a cash  collection, the  collection  is  processed  on  DD  Form  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher.    Process  a  DG01 transaction with at least a 3-month repayment and a C203 transaction with FORMAT-ID DG.  DG transactions are shown in Figure 70.2 through Figure 70.3. 70.2.2.  If the member voluntarily agrees to reimburse the government but wants the monies deducted  from  pay,  the  FSO  receives  either  a  DD  Form  362,  Statement  of  Charges/Cash Collection Voucher, or a DD Form 114, Military Pay Order, from the responsible officer or unit  supply  officer.    Process  a  DG01  transaction  with  a  repayment  per  the  statement  of charges. 70.2.3.  If the  member does  not voluntarily agree  to  reimburse the government, a DD  Form 200,  Financial  Liability  Investigation  of  Property  Loss,  is  prepared  and  sent  to  the  FSO.  Ensure  you  indicate  the  liability  amount  on  the  DD  Form  200  in  the  appropriate  block.  Process a DG01 transaction for the amount of liability. 70.2.4.  If the appropriation cited is other than 573019, an installation's appropriation, or for damage to family housing or dormitories, see paragraph 70.15. 70.3.  Overpayment  of  Pay  and  Allowances.  A  member  may  become  overpaid  for  pay  and allowances  due to a  stop or  change to an  entitlement.   The DQ indebtedness  may  be  computer generated  or  input  directly  by  the  FSO  or  DFAS.    The  FSO  must  notify  the  member  of  the indebtedness per paragraph 69.3.  If the member's DOS is imminent and an E6 transaction has not  been  received  (no  N7  on  the  MMPA),  collection  action  is  to  begin  immediately.    DQ transactions are shown in Figure 70.4 through 70.8. 70.3.1.  The  input  of  the  DQ  transaction  by  the  FSO  will  be  for  entitlement  overpayments that  are  outside  IAS.  If  the  entitlement  overpayment  is  entirely  within  IAS,  the  FSO  must ensure  that  the  applicable  retroactive  transaction  is  processed  that  will  cause  the  necessary entitlement adjustment. If part of the entitlement overpayment is outside IAS and part within, the FSO  will  process the DQ  for  the  period  outside IAS and then  the applicable retroactive transaction within IAS.  Example:  The current processing month is April and the member’s BAH should have been stopped effective 3 Mar of the prior year.  Process a DQ for the BAH overpayment for 3 Mar – 30 Apr of the prior year.  Then, process the 3502 effective 1 May of the  prior year.  DJMS  will automatically  establish a DQ for the period within IAS based AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1083  on  the  3502  transaction.    The  processes  described  below  apply  to  all  pay  affecting transactions  that  are  processed  unless  otherwise  specified.  If  multiple  entitlements  are adjusted  with  a  single  transaction,  the  results  will  be  based  on  the  net  effect  of  all entitlements that were adjusted by the transaction. 70.3.2.  When the applicable transaction is processed: 70.3.2.1.  The MMPA entitlement entry is updated to reflect the adjustment; 70.3.2.2.  A suspended MMPA DQ entry with a suspension reason code 9 is established for the net amount of the prior month's entitlement that was adjusted within IAS; 70.3.2.3.  A quasi-advance (FID 86) MMPA entry is established for the same amount as the suspended MMPA DQ entry; 70.3.2.4.  An XY management notice is generated to the servicing FSO and is to be used by the FSO to notify the member of the overpayment – due process; 70.3.2.5.  The  collection  of  the  DQ  will  start  automatically  the  first  update  of  the following  processing  month  plus  one  month  if  the  FSO  does  not  take  action  by processing  a  DQ18  or  DQ20  transaction.    Do  not  suspend  the  debt  collection  until  the member has provided a remission application; 70.3.2.6.  The current month entitlement adjustment is collected immediately.  If there is insufficient net pay, a suspended DQ MMPA entry and a quasi-advance (FID 86) MMPA entry are created for the unpaid amount and a XY management notice is generated to the servicing  FSO.    The  collection  of  this  DQ  is  started  when  additional  net  pay  becomes due. 70.3.3.  The establishment of a suspended DQ with a suspension reason code  9 as described above  does  not  apply  to  the  following  entitlements  and  processes:    additional  special  pay (FID  25),  registered  nurse  accession  bonus  (FID  26),  various  enlisted  bonuses  (FID  31), scientific  and  engineering  bonus  (FID  32),  selective  reenlistment  bonus  (FID  33),  initial enlistment bonus (FID 34), aviator retention bonus (FID 38), clothing replacement allowance (FID63),  disability  severance  pay  (FID  71),  discharge  gratuity  (FID  72),  lump  sum  leave (FID  74),  readjustment  pay  (FID  76),  severance  pay  (FID  77),  personal  expense  (FID  78), excess leave (FID SB), absent without leave (FID SJ), confinement (FID SK), desertion (FID SP),  and  separations  (FIDS  E4/E5).   Overpayments  of  the  above  entitlements  or overpayments  due to  separation  or  one  of  the above  statuses  will  be  collected lump  sum or with the repayment schedule reported in the DQ transaction. 70.3.4.  The establishment of a suspended MMPA DQ entry with a suspension reason code 9 applies to the following entitlements with exceptions: 70.3.4.1.  Move in housing allowance (FID 42).  Only if the net amount of the adjustment for the current and prior month is negative. 70.3.4.2.  Initial uniform and equipment allowance (FID 59).  Action indicator 06 only. 70.3.4.3.  Additional  uniform  and  equipment  allowance  (FID  60).    Action  indicator  06 only. 1084 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 70.3.4.4.  Extra  clothing allowance (FID 61).  Only  if  the  net amount  of  the adjustment for the current and prior month is negative. 70.3.4.5.  Temporary  lodging  allowance  (FID  79).    Only  if  the  start  date  is  in  a  prior month and the net amount of the adjustment is negative. 70.3.4.6.  Initial  civilian  clothing  allowance  (FID  81).    Only  if  the  net  amount  of  the adjustment for the current and prior month is negative. 70.3.4.7.  Continuing civilian clothing allowance (FID 82).  Only if the net amount of the adjustment for the current and prior month is negative. 70.3.4.8.  Leave  (non-excess)  processing  (FID  SB).    Only  if  the  net  amount  of  the adjustment for the prior month is negative and an entitlement other than basic allowance for subsistence (FID 40) is adjusted. 70.4.  Excess  Leave  Computations  and  Collections.  A  member  is  indebted  for  excess  leave when, at DOS, a negative leave balance is present.  Since a member can’t accrue leave for excess leave, a non-accrual for the number of excess leave days is added to the negative leave balance.  This non-accrual is charged at the same rate as normal accrual (0 -6 is 1/2, 7-12 is 1, 13-18 is 1 1/2, 19-24 is 2, and 25-30  is 2 1/2).   If,  for  example, the  member  has a  -20.0 leave balance at DOS, a non-accrual charge of 2.0 days would be added to the -20.0, for a total collection of -22.0 excess  leave  days.    Members  in  excess  leave  are  not  entitled  to  pay  and  allowances.    See DoDFMR (DoD Financial Management Regulation), Volume 7A, chapter 1.     Balance Brought Forward as of 1 Jan 07: Earned through Separation on 31 Oct 07: Used Example:                                                                                        1-15 May, 1-30 Jun, 1-10 Oct)     Leave dates pay and allowances collected:  1 – 10 Oct and 19 – 30 Jun; 22 days total. 30.0 days 25.0 days 75.0 days (leave periods 1-20 Mar,     Balance  *Non-Accrual   Total Excess LV collected          (.5 days for every 6 days)   -20.0 -2.0 -22.0       70.4.1.  Computing  Periods  of  Excess  Leave.    In  determining  the  period  of  leave  to  be collected as excess, begin with the last chargeable leave taken and count back from last day of  this leave until  the total  excess leave period is accounted  for.   If  more  than  one  leave  is involved,  follow  the  same  procedures.    Any non-chargeable leave is not  counted as part  of the  excess leave period  computation.   Research the  MCF, LES history, and  MMPA, and/or contact DFAS, if all the excess leave periods are not found. 70.4.2.  Computing  the  Amount  of  Collection.    The  excess  leave  cost  is  determined  by  the rate of pay in effect for the period of excess leave and not the rate in effect at DOS.  When computing the actual excess leave rate, use the rate in effect for each day of the excess leave period.    If  the  member's  pay  rate  changed  during  the  excess  leave  period,  two  rates  are involved  for  the  leave.    Excess  leave  before  the  rate  change  is  charged  at  the  old  rate(s).  Excess  leave  on  or  after  the  rate  change  is  charged  at  the  new  rate(s).    Do  not  round  any fractional  cents.    All  pay  and  allowances  are  subject  to  collection  for  excess  leave.    If  the excess leave results in a half-day, then the member is only charged for the half-day plus half-day non-accrual.  No rounding up or down of half days is permissible (the fractional one-half AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1085  day  is  considered  to  occur  on  the  first  day  of  the  excess  leave  involved,  per  DoDFMR, Volume 7A, table 1-11, note 6).  When computing the excess leave amount, always use the rate in effect on the last day of the leave. 70.5.  Health  Professionals  Special  Pays.  This  indebtedness  arises  when  a  medical  or  dental officer  separates  before  serving  the  period  of  active  duty  required  in  a  contract  he  or  she executed  for receipt of additional  special  pay (physicians and  dentists)  or  incentive  special  pay (physicians).    The  amount  of  the  debt  is  computed  at  DOS-10  days  and  the  FSO  receives  an XS03 management notice.  The indebtedness is a pro rata portion of the unserved contract period to  the  total  amount  of  special  pay  received  under  the  contract  (all  contracts  are  written  for  1 year).    When  the  member  separates  voluntarily  and  will  be  indebted  to  the  United  States  for recoupment  of  medical  or  dental  special  pay  and  does  not  elect  to  settle  before  discharge,  the member  signs  a  promissory  note  containing  agreement  for  judgment  (see  figure  70.1).    The amount  shown  on  the  promissory  note  will  be  after  the  computer  has  deducted  all  pay  due  at separation.    This  promissory  note  is  prepared  in  original  and  two  copies  and  is  filed  in  the member's separation work file; the member receives one copy.  The indebtedness is recorded on the MMPA as a DQ by DFAS. 70.6.  Excess  Cost  of  HHG/Trailer  Move.  Indebtedness  for  excess  cost  is  created  when  a member's shipment of household goods (HHG) exceeds the authorized weight allowance or the shipment  of  a  house  trailer  exceeds  the  authorized  mileage  rate.  The  Defense  Finance  and Accounting  Service  –  Indianapolis  Center  (DFAS-IN)  receives  the  carrier's  bill  and  makes  the payment  for the  shipment. DFAS-IN  makes an  initial  determination as  to  whether the  member has  a  potential  excess  cost,  based  on  the  billing  from  the  carrier  and  the  member's  authorized weight allowance or mileage rate, and notifies JPPSO-SAT/ECAF of the excess costs, if any. 70.6.1.  If  a  member  has  an  excess  cost,  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF  (ISI  8630)  takes  all  related action, including processing the necessary transactions.  They will prepare a DD Form 139, forward it to the member's servicing FSO (for informational purposes only), and provide due process  (notify  the  member  of  the  indebtedness  and  the  options).  In  addition,  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF  does  the    DR01  transaction  input  and  suspends  collection  of  the  indebtedness (DR transaction formats are shown in Figure 70.9  through 70.12). 70.6.2.  Collection Procedures. 70.6.2.1.  The member has 30 days to submit a rebuttal letter or a remission application, or  make  cash  payment.  If the  member opts to  file a remission or  pay  by cash, the  FSO must notify the local TMO office and JPPSO-SAT/ECAF to ensure no collection action is taken by them and no rebuttal has been submitted.  In this case, all necessary action is taken  by  the  FSO.    If  the  member  takes  no  action  with  the  FSO  or  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF after the 30  day notification, JPPSO-SAT/ECAF, as the  owner  of  the debt,  will  resume collection  of  the  indebtedness  by  processing  a  DR20.    If  the  debt  appears  on  the Open/Suspended  Questionable  Indebtedness  Listing,  then  the  FSO  must  take  action  to start the collection. 70.7.  Rebuttal  of  Excess  Cost.  A  rebuttal  letter  may  be  submitted  by  an  officer  or  enlisted member  (active  or  separated)  when  he  or  she  believes  the  excess  cost  charges  for  shipment  of HHGs  or  a  trailer  are  not  correct.  Only  one  rebuttal  may  be  submitted  for  each  overweight charge, unless new evidence is presented which has a bearing on the excess cost. Restatement of 1086 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 a  previous  allegation  is  not  considered  new  evidence.    The  rebuttal  has  to  be  completely adjudicated  by  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF,  before  the  member  submits  a  remission  application,  as  the debt amount may increase or decrease. The FSO must determine whether a rebuttal is pending if a remission application is submitted. 70.7.1.  If  the  member  contacts  the  FSO  for  a  rebuttal,  the  FSO  advises  the  member  to contact the local TMO for proper counseling and rebuttal procedures. 70.7.1.1.  The  member  must  submit a rebuttal letter to the  local TMO  within 30 days  of the notification of indebtedness.  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF will begin collection action after 30 days if a rebuttal letter has not been submitted. 70.7.1.2.  The TMO receives the member's rebuttal letter and reviews it for completeness and accuracy. The TMO then forwards a copy of the TMO's transmittal letter to the FSO and  the  original  package  to  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF,  8961  Tesoro  Drive,  Suite  300,  San Antonio  TX  78286-6209.    The  rebuttal  package  must  contain  at  least  the  following documents: 70.7.1.2.1.  Member's rebuttal letter. 70.7.1.2.2.  Copy of DD Form 139 70.7.1.2.3.  TDY or PCS orders with all amendments. 70.7.2.  Adjudication of the Rebuttal Letter. Upon adjudication, JPPSO-SAT/ECAF will take the necessary steps to increase or decrease the debt amount, or start collection. 70.7.2.1.  Collection  Procedures.    JPPSO-SAT/ECAF  will  input  a  DR05  transaction  to correct (increase or decrease) the amount of specific indebtedness.  If the amount did not change,  they  process  a  DR20  to  start  (resume)  collection  of  the  original  amount  or  a DR21 to forgive a portion (or all) of the indebtedness. 70.7.2.2.  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF notifies the member of the adjudication of the rebuttal letter and also forwards a copy of the letter to the TMO. 70.7.3.  Erroneously  Processed  DR01.  If  a  DR01  transaction  was  erroneously  processed against the MMPA and the current month is not the start date on the MMPA, contact DFAS-DE  via  CMS  case  for  corrective  action,  including  a  statement  of  all  pertinent  facts  in  the case.  If  refund  is  requested  for  a  pending  rebuttal,  state  the  date  of  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF’s written  notification to the  member, the  date of the member's  rebuttal letter, and the TMO's transmittal  letter.  No  refund  will  be  made  until  the  rebuttal  letter  has  been  completely adjudicated  unless  the  DR20  transaction  was  processed  before  30  days  after  written notification to the member. Section 70B—Advance Payments and Casual and Partial Payments 70.8.  Advance  Payments  (DV).  The  computer  generates  a  DV  indebtedness  entry  when  an advance  payment (PA) is  posted to the  MMPA.    A repayment  schedule  of 12  or 24  months is established from the PA03 transaction.  The DV entry will begin collecting the processing month following the date of the voucher payment.  If the date of the voucher  is the current processing month, the computer will suspend the DV entry with an action indicator 18.  A DV future-type L is  created  to  open  the  DV  entry  the  first  update  on  or  after  the  first  day  of  the  next  calendar AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1087  month.    If  a  12-month  repayment  schedule  was  established  in  the  DV  entry  when  a  24-month repayment  schedule  was  approved,  process  a  DT04  to  change  the  monthly  deduction  amount.  The  member  also  has  the  option  to  make  partial  repayments  in  cash.    Process  cash  collection transaction  on  a  DD  1131  as  a  C203.    Figure  65.4  shows  the  correct  format.    The  repayment schedule may not be for more than 24 months from the start date of the original DV entry unless the  advance  is  an  advance  payment  of  overseas  housing  allowance.    (See  Chapter  30.)    To determine  whether  you  have  any  overdue  advances,  the  “Advance  Pay  Repayment  Past  Due Date” Report (UH099C0374) is available on  SAR.  It  can  be accessed by  JFAREG  FA0374M.  Check this report quarterly and  take  corrective action  if  necessary.  To  determine  whether  you have any overdue advances, the “advance pay repayment past due date” report (UH099C0374) is available  on SAR.  It can be accessed by JFAREG FA0374M.  Check this report  quart erly and take corrective action if necessary. 70.9.  Casual and Partial Payments (DW).  Casual and partial payments are not automatically prorated.  Before making a casual or partial payment, the FSO must advise the member that the payment must be collected before any further payments are made to the member. 70.9.1.  When  a  casual  or  partial  payment  is  posted  to  the  MMPA,  the  computer automatically  collects  any  funds  available  in  the  P5  entry  to  satisfy  the  casual  or  partial payment.    If  the  P5  entry  does  not  have  enough  funds  to  satisfy  collection,  the  computer generates a DW entry for any balance due after the current month P5 entry is reduced to zero.  The DW entry is suspended with an action indicator Q8.  A DQ suspense-type 2 is created to open the DW entry the first update on or after the first day of the next calendar month. 70.10.  Compensation  Received  From  Non-Government  Sources  (DS).  No  member  may retain  any  compensation  or  stipend  received  from  non-government  sources  for  performing  any duty or service as part of his or her military function.  This dual compensation received must be turned in to the FSO.   See 37 Comp.  Gen. 29 (1957).  If  member does  not  elect to  turn in the money, an involuntary deduction can be made from the member's pay (see paragraph 70.17 for medical  stipend).  If  member  pays  cash  or  has a  payroll  deduction,  process the DS using the D company code of the FSO.  When the JUMPS Miscellaneous check is received, the collection is made, using a DD Form 1131, to the proper appropriation/line  of accounting.  Normally, a DD Form 139 is submitted to the FSO, but a cover letter may be submitted in lieu of it as long as it indicates the member was first notified about the debt and copies of the AF Form 118, Refund of Tuition  Assistance-Education  Services  Program,  and  AF  Form  1227,  Authority  for  Tuition Assistance-Education Services Program, are attached.  A multiple DD Form 139 or cover letter, not to exceed 15 members, may be accepted. 70.11.  Jury  Duty  Fees  and  Witness  Fees.  When  a  member  performs  jury  duty  or  acts  as  a witness and is not in a leave status, he or she is indebted to the United States Government for the fees received for jury duty or acting as a witness.  The member may keep monies received and identified as for expenses (for example, transportation expenses) whether or not in a leave status.  If  the  member  cannot  make  a  cash  payment  for  the  debt,  process  a  DS01  transaction  with indebtedness-type V, using the D company code of the FSO.  When the JUMPS Miscellaneous check is received, the collection is made, using a DD Form 1131, to the proper appropriation/line of accounting. Section 70C—Miscellaneous Indebtedness 1088 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Do not input any miscellaneous debt (FID DS) using a line of accounting/appropriation.  All DS transactions will be input using a company code.  For travel debts at bases that have not cutover to  the  AFFSC,  this  means  that  the  D  company  code  of  the  FSO  will  be  used;  bases  that  have already cutover to the AFFSC use the D company code of the AFFSC.  For all other DS debts, the  D  company  code  of  the  FSO  is  used,  if  the  creditor  organization  doesn’t  have  a  company code  established,  whether  cutover  or  not, unless  specifically  excluded in the paragraphs  below.  When  the  JUMPS  Miscellaneous  check  is  received  in  the  FSO/AFFSC,  the  collection  will  be made, using a DD Form 1131, to the proper appropriation/line of accounting. 70.12.  Overpayment of Advance Travel and Travel Costs.  An indebtedness for overpayment of advance travel is generated when a member files a DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-voucher,  or  when  an  advance  travel  payment  is  made  and  the  member  does  not  perform  the travel. 70.12.1.  When an indebtedness is identified, Travel notifies the member of the debt.  If the member  does  not  pay  the  debt, Travel  prepares a DD Form 139 and  forwards it  to  Military Pay  for  collection.    The  repayment  must  be  collected  by  DOS,  and  the  minimum  monthly repayment  is  $50.    A  DS01  transaction  with  indebtedness  type  P  is  processed  to  begin collection. 70.12.2.  The appropriate FSO’s D company code (if the base hasn’t cutover to the AFFSC) or  the  D  company  code  for  the  AFFSC  (if  already  cutover)  should  be  used  in  the  DS01 transaction.    This  applies  to  all  RTS  travel  debts,  including  open  allotment  citing  station 525725, as well as other Military Services.  Appropriations should not be used for any Travel Miscellaneous  debts  (format  ID  DS  type  P);  this  will  ensure  the  debt  is  cleared  out  of  the paying travel system. 70.13.  Cost-Charge  Transportation  Request  (TR).  A  member  on  leave in  your area may be issued a TR  for return travel  to  his/her  duty  station.  The cost  of this TR  is deducted  from the member's MMPA. 70.13.1.  If  the  TR  is  issued  by  a  Scheduled  Airline  Ticket  Office  (SATO),  a  billing  is received by the travel SMA.  Travel pays the billing and furnishes a copy of the paid voucher to  Military  Pay.    Military  Pay  processes  a  PC03  transaction,  using  the  T  disbursement voucher number for the cost of the TR.  (See Chapter 36, for processing instructions.) 70.13.2.  If the TR is issued by a non-SATO, the issuing office bills DFAS-IN and sends the member's  servicing  FSO a letter advising  of the TR.  The  latter information is used  only  to answer customer inquiries.  DFAS-IN pays the billing and forwards documentation to DFAS-DE for collection from the member's MMPA. 70.13.3.  When  a  member  reports  for  transportation  requiring  travel  between  CONUS  and overseas  or  between  overseas  areas,  an  MTA  is  issued.    Cost  charge  MTAs  are  all  sent directly  to HQ  AMC/ACIA.    Upon receipt  of the  MTA,  ACIA  prepares an  SF Form 1080, Voucher  for  Transfer  Between  Appropriations  and/or  Funds,  for  processing  of  a  PC03 against  the  member's  MMPA  by  the  Scott  AFB  finance  office  using  a  "T"  disbursement voucher number for the cost of the MTA. 70.14.  Reserved for Future Use. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1089  70.15.  Damage  to  Family  Housing  Unit  or  Unaccompanied  Personnel  Housing  Unit (Dormitory).  A  member  may  become  indebted  as  a  result  of  a  report  of  survey  that  assesses liability for damage, failure to satisfactorily clean or loss of equipment or  furnishings to family housing or dormitories (see  AFMAN 23-220).  DD Form 200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, supports the DD Form 139 received from FM/ALO.  A member's signature in block 16 of the DD  Form 200 assures that  he or  she has been notified  of the  financial liability.  (If signature is absent, return the documents to FM/ALO, who will then return the DD Form 200 to the reports of survey administrator.)  For remission information refer to Chapter 73. 70.16.  Medical Care Charges.  See Chapter 49 for collection of medical care charges. 70.17.  Medical  Officer  Furnished  Stipend.  This  indebtedness  can  be  created  from  two sources: 70.17.1.  Stipend received for compensation from a state, county, municipality, or a privately owned hospital by an active duty medical officer while performing medical services. 70.17.2.  Overpayment  of  stipend  received  from  DFAS  Reserve  Pay  while  the  medical officer was attending school before commissioning in the Air Force.  DFAS forwards a DD Form 139 to the FSO for entering the debt and notifying the member.  If the member elects to pay cash for the overpayment, do not input any DJMS transaction unless the debt is already entered on the MMPA. 70.17.3.  The  hospital  forwards  a  statement  as  to  the  amount  of  the  stipend  received  per paragraph  70.17.1  above  to  the  FSO  and  personnel.    The  FSO  holds  the  statement  in suspense pending receipt of the DD  Form 114, Military  Pay  Order (MPO), from  personnel.  If  member  pays  cash  or  permits  a  payment  deduction,  process  a  DS  using  the  D  company code of the FSO.  When the JUMPS Miscellaneous check is received, the collection is made, using a DD Form 1131, to the proper appropriation/line of accounting. 70.18.  Housing.  A member may become indebted to the housing office for failure to adequately clean  government quarters on termination  of  assignment to those quarters.  The housing  office must notify the member of the charges and request payment.  If the member refuses or does not respond  to  the  notification,  the  housing  office  prepares  a  DD  Form  139  and  forwards  it  to  the member's servicing FSO.  The DD Form 139 must indicate when the housing office notified the member of the debt.  The FSO processes a DS01 transaction with indebtedness-type J and the D company  code  of  the  Housing  Office;  if  the  Housing  Office  doesn’t  have  its  own  D  company code,  request  one  following  the  procedures  in  Chapter  60  of  this  manual,  and  use  the  D company code of the local FSO in the interim. 70.19.  Replacement  Checks  and  FSO-Accepted  Dishonored  Checks.  A  member  may become indebted for a replacement check when the original and replacement check were cashed, or  for  a  personal  check  the  FSO  cashed  which  was  dishonored,  or  for  a  check,  accepted  for payment of a debt, which was dishonored.  These debts may be increa sed by the amount of any associated  administrative,  interest,  or  penalty  charges  that  are  assessed.    The  member  must  be notified of the debt and asked to make immediate payment to the FSO.  If the member refuses or does not respond to the notification, prepare a DD Form 139 (see figure 2.6) and process a DS01 transaction with indebtedness-type D and the FSO's D prefix company code. 1090 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 70.19.1.  When the Treasury Department denies the FSO's request to cancel an original check indicating  the  member  has  cashed  both  the  original  and  replacement  check,  for  any repayment  by  the  member,  prepare  a  DD  Form  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher,  crediting account 57F3880.  The collection is recorded in accountability records as a refund and as an increase to deposits or cash on hand per DoDFMR Volume 5. 70.19.2.  When  the  FSO  cashes  a  check,  other  than  a  commissary  check,  which  is  later dishonored,  collection  can  be  made  from  the  MMPA  for  up  to  two-thirds  of  the  member's pay.  (See DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 50.) 70.19.3.  FSOs  are  authorized  to  cash  checks  for  other  Service  members  under  certain circumstances  under  the  authority  of  the  inter-service  check  cashing  agreement.    Upon receipt  of  a  dishonored  check,  the  cashing  member  and  the  service's  point  of  contact  are notified.  If consent to collect voluntarily was obtained by virtue of a check cashing consent notice  posted  at  the  cashier's  cage,  annotate  the  DD  Form  139  for  Army  and  Air  Force members only and  proceed  with  collection action.  Do  not attempt to  collect  from Navy  or Marine  Corps  personnel  on  the  basis  of  the  check  cashing  notice.    For  these  and  other involuntary  collections,  the  member  is  advised  of  responsibility  to  make  direct  payment  to the FSO by the next payday and shall be provided with at least 30 days' written notice of due process  in  accordance  with  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  50.    If  the  payment  is  not received  within 30 days, the  FSO  submits a DD  Form 139 to the  service  disbursing  officer currently  servicing  the  member.    The  DD  Form  139  must  contain  the  following  statement:  "Member has been provided due process in accordance with DoDFMR, Volume 7A, chapter 50.” 70.19.4.  As  a  condition  of  exercising  the  privilege  of  check  cashing,  a  member  may  be required  to  sign  an  agreement  consenting  to  collection  by  pay  offset  if  his  or  her  check  is dishonored.  Such consent is recognized as an effective manifestation of a voluntary consent to collect from current pay.  As a voluntary collection, neither the due process requirements (paragraph 69.3) nor the two-thirds rule (paragraph 69.7) apply and the full amount of the debt or a lesser amount determined adequate to protect the interests of the government may be immediately collected by pay offset.  This consent to collect statement is suspended where accommodation  check  cashing  services  are  being  provided  and  a  check  cashing  consent notice is posted. 70.20.  Debts Established as a Result of OSI Investigations.  When an OSI report indicates a debt  should be  established, it is the responsibility  of  the  FSO  where the  member  is assigned to ensure that the debt is verified, computed, and established.  These actions will normally be taken by the  organization responsible  for  the  subject  matter  of the  debt.   If  the  member has  departed PCS,  issue  a  DD  Form  139  (with  supporting  documentation)  to  the  member's  gaining  FSO  as outlined  in  chapter  2.    If  the  member  has  separated,  establish  the  debt  and  follow  procedur es outlined in DoDFMR, Vol 5, chapter 29, and AFI 65-114.  In all cases, the initiating FSO must provide a report to DFAS as outlined in DoDFMR, Vol 5, chapter 28. 70.21.  Air  Force Education  Assistance.  Upon determination that a member is in debt for Air Force educational assistance, the education office must notify the member of the amount of the debt.  Notification will be accomplished by returning a copy of the AF Form 118 to the member.  If the member does not make a cash payment within 30 days, the education office will prepare a DD  Form  139  with  copies  of  AF  Forms  118  and  1227  attached.    The  DD  Form  139  with AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1091  attachments  will  then  be  forwarded  to  the  FSO  for  collection  action.    FSO  posts  the  DS01 transaction with indebtedness type U and the D prefix company code of the education office.  If the  base  has  already  cutover,  the  FSO  provides  the  DD  Form  139  to  the  AFFSC  and  requests posting  of  the  debt.    Documentation  supporting  the  action  requested  on  the  DD  Form  139  is maintained in the management case file (see paragraph 69.9 for additional information). 70.22.  Reserved for Future Use. 70.23.  Telephone  and  Utility  Bills  and  Trailer  Space  Rental.  A  member  may  become indebted to the government  for  charges  of telephone bills, utility  bills (under  AFI 33-111), and trailer space rental.  The member must be notified of the charges and asked to make payment by the activity assessing the charges.  If the base accounts receivable system (BARS) is not in use, process a DS01 transaction with indebtedness type K and the D prefix company code shown in the appropriation data field on the DD Form 139.  If BARS is utilized, the collection is made by DJMS-AC via posting a partial (PK) every month using a file from the appropriate office. 70.24.  Billeting.  A  member  may  become indebted to  the  billeting  office  for  failure to  pay the charges  for  government  quarters  while  on  leave  or  TDY.    When  a  member  checks  out  of quarters, he or she is required to clear through the billeting office and pay for the charges at that time.  If the member refuses  or  cannot  make  payment, the  billeting  office  prepares a DD Form 139  and  forwards  it  to  the  FSO.    The  DD  Form  139  must  indicate  when  the  billeting  office notified the member of the debt.  The FSO processes a DS01 transaction with indebtedness type J.  If the billeting office is Air Force, the D prefix company code of the billeting office must be shown in the appropriation data field on the DD Form 139.  If the billeting office is Army, Navy, Marine Corps,  or Coast Guard, the  FSO  gets the D-prefix company of  the billeting  office  from Table 50. 70.25.  Salary Offset.  In accordance  with the Debt Collection  Act of 1982 and 5 U.S.C. 5514, DJMS-AC provides salary offset collections from members’ pay to non-DoD agencies.  A list of these agencies can be viewed on DJMS table 401. 70.25.1.  Salary offset debts are received by DJMS for collection from members’ pay. 70.25.2.  Collection of the salary offset will be established as a miscellaneous debt (DS) with INDEBT-TYPE T. 70.25.3.  Deduction is limited to 15 percent of disposable pay.  Disposable pay is defined in paragraph 69.7. 70.25.4.  Current system processing accelerates salary offset debts at separation. 70.25.5.  Due  process  has  already  been  provided  by  the  creditor  agency.    The  system provides a courtesy notice of pending collection action (figure 69.2,  DJMS-AC Notification Letter). 70.26.  Other  Miscellaneous  Debts.  Debts  listed  below  are  collected  using  the  procedures  in this paragraph.  Contact your MAJCOM  if questions arise on whether a debt not listed may be deducted from a member's pay.  These collections are involuntary. 70.26.1.  These debts include the following: 70.26.1.1.  Education  assistance.    (VA  over-payments  require  member's  consent  for collection.) 1092 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 70.26.1.2.  All library charges. 70.26.1.3.  Accommodation transactions. 70.26.2.  Documentation must be provided to the FSO to support the collection action.  The initiating office must have first contacted the member before requesting deduction. 70.26.3.  Normally a DD Form 139 is submitted to the FSO but any acceptable form may be submitted as long as the form or attachments indicate the member has already been notified of the  debt.      If  one FSO  prepares a DD  Form 139 for a member,  but  the funds  pertain to another FSO, send one copy of the form, after posting, to the other FSO. 70.26.4.  Process  a  DS01  transaction  with  the  appropriate  indebtedness-type  code  to  begin collection.  The D company code belonging to the originator of the debt is used in the DS01 transaction.  If the originator doesn’t have a D company code, request one in accordance with procedures  in  chapter  60  of  this  volume  and  use  the  D  company  code  for  the  FSO  in  the interim. 70.27.

Description.  This chapter contains information on the following types of indebtedness: 71.1.1.  Dishonored Checks from Dependents 71.1.2.  Dishonored Commissary Checks 71.1.3.  AF Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentality 71.1.4.  Other Services Non-appropriated Fund Instrumentality 71.1.5.  Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) 71.1.6.  Army & Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) Tactical Field Exchange (TFE) 71.1.7.  Other Service Exchange 71.2.  Dishonored Checks from Dependents.  With the  exception of  dishonored commissary checks,  there  is  no  statutory  authority  for  involuntary  collection  from  a  member ’s  pay  for  a dishonored  check written by a dependent.  Dishonored checks written by dependents may only be  collected  from  the  member’s  pay  with  the  member’s  written  consent.    (Exception:    Public Law  105-261,  Section  364,  provides  authority  for  collection  of  commissary  dishonored checks,  as  well  as  the  associated  charges  for  those  checks,  from  a  member  for  a  dishonored check  written  by  either  the  member  or  the  member’s  dependents.  This  collection  may  be accomplished without the member’s written consent.) 71.3.  Dishonored  Commissary  Checks.  A  dishonored  check  to  the  commissary  may  be collected involuntarily.   All  pay  (except  allowances,  FITW,  FICA,  SITW,  and  SGLI  premium) are subject to deduction for the dishonored check.  The two-thirds rule does not apply. 71.3.1.  Commissaries  located  in  CONUS  will  submit  these  debts  directly  to  DFAS-Columbus (DECA), not to the FSO.  Commissaries located overseas will submit these debts to the FSO. 71.3.2.  When  a  check  is  returned  as  uncollectible,  the  commissary  must  notify  the member  and  attempt  collection  for  the  check.    If  the  member  refuses  or  cannot  make payment,  the  commissary  sends  a  DD  Form  139  to  the  local  DAO  (Materiel  section).  The DD Form 139 must include a record of collection action, including the date the member was  notified  of  the  debt  (a  copy  of  the  commissary's  letter  to  the  member  concerning  the debt  and  requesting  payment  is  adequate).  In  the  appropriation  data  field,  the  Materiel section  adds  the  D  prefix  company  code  of  the  activity  to  receive  payment  for  the dishonored check and sends the DD Form 139 to the local Military Pay section. 71.3.2.1.  For members not  serviced  by  the local  FSO, the  military  pay  section provides locator service by adding the address of the member's servicing FSO to the DD Form 139 and returns the DD Form 139 to the Materiel section.  The Materiel section sends the DD Form 139 package to the member's servicing FSO. 1150 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 71.3.2.2.  For  members  serviced  by  the  local  FSO,  the  military  pay  section  advises  the Materiel section the DD Form 139 is being processed. 71.3.3.  The member must be given 30 days notice per paragraph 69.3   The 30 days notice begins on the date of the commissary's letter to the member.  The FSO is not required to give the  member  additional  notification.  The  FSO  processes  a  DS01 transaction  with indebtedness-type L and the D prefix company code shown on the DD Form 139. 71.4.  Air Force Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality.  A member, dependent, or guest of a member may become indebted to a non-appropriated  fund instrumentality (NAFI)  for charges or  for dishonored checks.  The DoDFMR authorizes involuntary collection from a member's pay for  such  indebtedness  of  the  member;  however,  collection  for  such  indebtedness  from  any member's pay if the debt was incurred by a dependent may not be collected without the member's consent. 71.4.1.  Consent Agreement.   A NAFI may require a member to sign a consent agreement before  authorizing  charges  or  check-cashing  privileges  for  the  member  or  his  or  her dependent(s).  A consent agreement is a written statement authorizing deduction from pay for the debt.  The agreement must be a  clear and precise authorization  containing  the  member's SSN and must be signed and dated by the member.   The  consent agreement  may  be in any written  format  so  long  as  the  above  conditions  are  met.    The  following  statement  is  an example  of  such a  consent  statement:   "In  consideration  of  the (NAFI involved) accepting payment  by  check  for  goods  or  services,  cashing  personal  checks,  and  accepting  credit sales for myself, my dependents, and guests, I hereby authorize a deduction from my pay for any dishonored check (including any associated processing charge) or charge which is not on time.    "The  consent  agreement  may  be  withdrawn,  in  writing,  at  any  time  by  the  member; however,  a  deduction  from  the  member's  pay  is  authorized  for  the  specific  debt  incurred under  the  agreement  before  the  date  the  written  withdrawal  is  received  by  the  NAFI involved. 71.4.2.  Notification.    When  an  indebtedness  occurs,  the  member  is  notified  by  the  Non-appropriated  Fund Financial  Management Branch (NAFFMB)  or NAFI  concerned and asked to make payment for the amount of the debt.   If  the  member refuses, does not  make payment,  or  does  not  respond,  the  NAFFMB  or  NAFI  notifies  the  member's  unit commander for assistance in collection of the debt.  If the  member  is  separating  within 30 days,  notification  to  the  unit  commander  is  waived.    The  NAFFMB  prepares  a DD Form 139 and forwards it to the member's servicing FSO. 71.4.3.  FSO  Procedures.    Review  the  DD  Form  139  to  verify  that  the  debt  is  proper  and documentation complete. 71.4.3.1.  Ensure that either: 71.4.3.1.1.  The DD Form 139 has the following statement completed:  "The member named  above  was  notified  in  writing  on  (date)  concerning  a  (type  of  debt)  to (facility)  in  the  amount  of  (amount).  This  certifies  due  process  procedures,  as provided  in  DODR  7000-14,  Volumes  1  and  5,  were  completed.  The  member's commander was notified on (date) to assist with collection of the debt.   The debt was incurred  by  (name).   No  payment  has  been  received  to  date. Request  collection  be taken in accordance with DoDFMR, Volume 7A, table 50-5, rule 6” or AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1151  71.4.3.1.2.  A signed consent is attached to the DD Form 139. 71.4.3.2.  A  consent  agreement  is  attached  to  the  DD  Form  139  if  the  debt  was incurred  by a dependent or guest of any member.  The consent agreement must conform with  the  guidelines  in  paragraph  71.4.1  above  and  be  signed  before  the  date  of  the indebtedness.    If  the  consent  agreement  was  obtained  after  the  indebtedness  occurred, the  statement  must  include  the  amount  of  the  debt,  the  date  of  the  debt,  the  member's SSN,  and  be  signed  and  dated  by  the  member.    A  consent  agreement  signed  only  by  a dependent is ineffective. 71.4.3.3.  No  deduction  from  pay  is  made  before  30  days  after  the  date  of  the notification to the member, unless the member is separating within that period. 71.4.3.4.  The  D  prefix  company  code  must  be  in  the  appropriation  data  field  on  the DD Form 139. 71.4.3.5.  If the  member is  separating  within 30 days, the  following  statement  must also be on the DD  Form 139:   "The  member is  scheduled to  separate  on (date),  notification to  the unit  commander is waived."  The FSO will accept the DD Form 139 providing the member has not cleared the FSO on out-processing. 71.4.3.6.  If  the  DD  Form  139  is  not  complete,  return  to  the  NAFFMB  for  appropriate action. 71.4.4.  Collection of Indebtedness from MMPA.  The debt is collected from the MMPA after the FSO procedures in paragraph 71.4.3 above are completed.  No collection may be made for  the  debt  of  a  dependent  or  guest  of  any  member  unless  a  consent  agreement  is provided.    Any  FSO  may  input  a  valid  debt  on  the  MMPA  even  though  the  member  has another  servicing  FSO.    Generally,  the  collection  will  be  a  one-time  deduction  unless  the debt  causes  collections  to  exceed  two-thirds  of  pay  (see  paragraph  69.7)  or  results  in documented  financial  hardship.    When  collection  is  limited  by  the  two-thirds  rule,  the uncollected balance will be collected the next month. 71.4.4.1.  If the member is not separating within 30 days, process a DS01 transaction with indebtedness  type  M  and  the  D  prefix  company  code  shown  in  the  appropriation  data field of the DD Form 139. 71.4.4.2.  If  the  member  is  retired,  send  the  DD  Form  139  to  DFAS-CL/RO,  PO  Box 99191,  Cleveland  OH  44199-1126.    Their  phone  numbers  are  DSN  380-5770  or  5534, commercial (216) 522-3770.  Their datafax  numbers are:  DSN 580-5237 or  commercial (216) 522-5237. 71.4.4.3.  If the member is separating within 30 days, compute the amount of pay due the member  through date of  separation (DOS),  including any accrued leave and taking into consideration  any  other  known  debts,  excluding  the  miscellaneous  indebtedness identified in paragraph 69.16.1. 71.4.4.3.1.  If  the  member  will  have  enough  pay  due,  based  on  the  computation,  to satisfy  the  NAFI  indebtedness,  process  a  DS01  transaction  with  indebtedness  type M and the  D  prefix company  code  in  the  appropriation  data  field  of  the  DD  Form 139.    (Input  screens  for  DS  transactions  are  shown  in  Figure  70.13  through Figure 70.17). 1152 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 71.4.4.3.2.  If the  member  has  pay due,  but  will not  have enough  pay due, based  on the  computation, to  satisfy the NAFI indebtedness,  process a DS01 transaction  with indebtedness  type  M  and  the  D  prefix  company  code  in  the  appropriation  data  field of the DD Form 139 for the amount which can be collected. 71.4.4.3.3.  If  the  member  has  no  pay  due,  based  on  the  computation,  return  the  DD Form 139 to the NAFFMB without action.  Indicate on the DD Form 139 that the member has no pay due on DOS and  provide the member's  future  mailing address in the  LF/N7/NN entry of the MMPA for the NAFFMB to pursue collection. 71.4.4.3.4.  For  the  DS01  transaction  processed  in  71.4.4.3.1  or  71.4.4.3.2  above, return a posted copy of the DD Form 139 to the NAFFMB.  If only a portion of the indebtedness  was  collected,  indicate  on  the  DD  Form  139  the  reason  for  partial collection,  the  amount  collected,  and  the  member's  future  mailing  address.    When making the separation payment to the member based on the computation of pay due, deduct  the  amount  of  specific  indebtedness  in  the  DS01  transaction  processed  for the NAFI indebtedness. 71.4.4.3.5.  When  the  member  disputes  collection  and  the  debt  was  properly processed  based  on  the  DD  Form  139,  the  member  must  contact  the  NAFFMB  to resolve the dispute. 71.5.  Other Services Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality.  A member or dependent of a member  may  become  indebted  to  the  non-appropriated  fund  instrumentality  (NAFI)  of  the Army,  Navy,  Marine  Corps,  or  Coast  Guard  for  charges  or  dishonored  checks.  The  DoDFMR authorizes  involuntary  collection  from  member's  pay  for  such  indebtedness  of  the  member; however, collection from any member's pay if the debt was incurred by a dependent may not be collected without the member's consent. 71.5.1.  Consent Agreement.   A NAFI may require a member to sign a consent agreement before  authorizing  charges  or  check-cashing  privileges  for  the  member  or  his  or  her dependent(s).  A consent agreement is a written statement authorizing deduction from pay for the debt.  The agreement must be a  clear and precise authorization  containing  the  member's SSN and must be signed and dated by the member.   The  consent agreement  may  be in any written  format  so  long  as  the  above  conditions  are  met.    The  consent  agreement  may  be withdrawn,  in  writing,  at  any  time  by  the  member;  however,  a  deduction  from  the member's  pay  is  authorized  for  the  specific  debt  incurred  under  the  agreement  before the date the written withdrawal is received by the NAFI involved. 71.5.2.  Notification.  When  an  indebtedness  occurs,  the  member  should  be  notified  by  the NAFI concerned and asked to  make payment  for the debt.   If the  member refuses, does not make  payment,  or  does  not  respond,  the  NAFI  notifies  the  member's  unit  commander  for assistance  in  collection  of the debt.  If the member is separating within 30 days, notification to the unit commander is waived.  If the DD  Form 139 does not  indicate  when  the  member and commander were notified, return the DD Form 139 to the NAFI for completion. 71.5.3.  Collection  of  Indebtedness  from  MMPA.    Review  the  DD  Form  139  to  verify  that the debt is proper and documentation complete.   No collection may be made for the debt of a dependent  of any member unless a consent agreement is provided.  Any FSO may input a valid  debt  on  the  MMPA  even  though  the  member  has  another  servicing  FSO.    The AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1153  collection  must  be a one-time deduction unless the  debt exceeds two-thirds  pay.   When the debt  exceeds  two-thirds  pay,  at  least  two-thirds  pay  must  be  deducted  with  the  balance collected the next month. 71.5.3.1.  Process a DS01 transaction with indebtedness type M and the D prefix company code of the NAFI shown on Table 50. 71.5.3.2.  If the member is separating within 30 days, compute the amount of pay due the member  through  DOS,  including  any  accrued  leave  and  taking  into  consideration  any other known debts. An enlisted member is entitled to one-third of his or her pay for that month,  unless  the  member agrees to a collection of all pay.  Process a DS01 transaction for only the portion of the debt which may be collected from final pay.  Use indebtedness type M and the D prefix company code of the NAFI shown on Table 50. 71.5.3.3.  Return a posted copy of the DD Form 139 to the NAFI.  If only a portion of the indebtedness  was  collected,  indicate  on  the  DD  Form  139  that  the  member  has insufficient  pay  to  make  full  collection,  the  amount  collected,  and  provide  the member's future mailing address.   When making the separation payment to the member, deduct  the  amount  of  specific  indebtedness  in  the  DS01  transaction  processed  for  the NAFI indebtedness. 71.5.3.4.  If the member disputes collection and the debt was properly processed based on the DD Form 139, the member must contact the NAFI to resolve the dispute. 71.6.  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES).  A  member  or  a  dependent  of  a member  can become  indebted  to  AAFES  for  home  layaway,  rental  agreements,  or  dishonored checks.  The  member can also become indebted for a delinquent Deferred Payment Plan (DPP) account.  The DoDFMR authorizes involuntary collection from a member's (enlisted or officer) pay for these debts; however, the member's written consent is required, prior to collection  from pay, for a debt incurred by his/her dependent. 71.6.1.  Notification  and  Consent  Agreement.    HQ-AAFES  (ADSN  3730)  is  required  to provide  the  member  with  'due  process'  prior  to  making  any  collection  from  pay.  They  will provide  two  notices  to  the  member  requesting  payment.  If  the  member  does  not  make payment  or  does  not  respond,  HQ-AAFES  will  notify  the  member's  commander  for assistance.    At  this  point,  HQ-AAFES  will  begin  collection  actions.  When  the  debt  is incurred by a member's dependent, HQ-AAFES is required to obtain written consent from the member prior to any collection actions. 71.6.2.  Edits.    The  edits  for  the  DS01  (start),  DS04  (change),  and  DS06  (cancel)  for INDEBT-TYPE F and company code D005245 will be as follows: 71.6.2.1.  DS01-Start:    HQ-AAFES  will  input  a  DS01  with  an  INDEBT-TYPE  F  and company  code  D005245.    The  input  DS01  SPEC-INDEBT  and  AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MO  fields  could  contain  different  values.    The  DS  entry  SPEC-INDEBT  and AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MO  will  contain  the  value  of  the  input  DS01  AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MO  field.    The  DS  entry  will  be  displayed  in  the  closed  portion  of  the MMPA. 71.6.2.2.  DS04-Change:    This  transaction  will  edit  against  the  INDEBT-TYPE  (F)  and company code (D005245) fields only.  Since the DS entry will be closed on the MMPA, 1154 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 the edits have been changed to process against a  closed entry.  (The input DS 04 SPEC-INDE BT and AM TSP EC-DED TN-CR-MO fields could contain different values .) T he DS  entry SPEC-INDEBT and AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MO field. NOTE:  A DS04 will process against a current month closed for INDEBT-TYPE F only. 71.6.2.3.  DS06-Cancel:    This  transaction  will  edit  against  the  INDEBT-TYPE  (F)  and company code (D005245) fields only. 71.6.3.  HQ-AAFES  Procedures.  After  the  member  has  been  provided  'due  process', HQ-AAFES will take the following actions: 71.6.3.1.  Input  a  DS01  (start)  transaction  with  the  INDEBT-TYPE  F,  company  code equal  to  D005245,  SPEC-INDEBT  equal  to  the  total  amount  of  the  debt.    Input AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CM  equal  to  the  deduction  amount.    The  management  notice (UR03)  will  be  sent  to  the  finance  office  notifying  them  that  AAFES  has  processed  a DS01 (start). 71.6.3.2.  Input  a  DS04  (change)  transaction  whenever  an  adjustment  is  required  to  the debt. 71.6.3.3.  Input a DS06 (cancel) transaction as required. 71.6.3.4.  The transactions will be file transferred via JDC to DFAS-DE, as required. 71.6.3.5.  HQ-AAFES will be responsible to answer the member's questions regarding the AAFES debt.      1-800-826-1317 within the United States 967-6003 DSN 71.6.3.6.  Members overseas should contact their local AAFES outlet. 71.6.4.  Finance  Office  Procedures.    The  finance  office  will  be  required  to  review  each MMPA listed on the management notice to ensure the deduction amount does not exceed the 2/3 rule. 71.6.4.1.  If  the  deduction  amount  exceeds  the  2/3  rule,  process  a  DS04  (change) transaction  to  reduce  both  the  AMT-SPEC-INDEBT  and  AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MO appropriately. 71.6.4.2.  If the member contacts the finance office stating the deduction amount creates a  financial  hardship,  the  finance  office  has  the  option  to  process  a  DS04  transaction  to reduce both the AMT-SPEC-INDEBT and AMT-SPEC-DEDTN-CR-MO to a reasonable amount. 71.6.4.3.  Input  a  DS06  (cancel)  transaction  as  required.    This  will  be  an  exception; most of the time a DS06 will be processed by HQ-AAFES. 71.6.4.4.  Answer the member's questions regarding the Leave and Earning Statement. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1155  71.7.  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service  (AAFES)  Tactical  Field  Exchanges  (TFE).   A    T F E    i s an  AAFES  activity  established  to  provide  merchandise  and  services  to  military personnel deployed to an area where permanent exchange activities do not exist.  (See DoDFMR Volume 5, chapter 16.)  The TFE stamps the reverse  of each personal check accepted  with:  "In consideration  of  the  acceptance  of  payment  by  check  for  AAFES  goods  and  services,  I  hereby authorize a deduction of the amount of this check from my pay account in  the event this check is  returned  as  dishonored,  including  interest  and  processing  charges."   The  writer is required to sign this clause.  The FSO immediately prepares a DD Form 139 for each  dishonored  check received  and  submits  it  to  the  appropriate  servicing  FSO  (Military  Pay)  with  a  copy  of  the front and back of the check.  The amount of the indebtedness shown on the DD Form 139 will be the sum of the check plus the amount of any interest and service charges.  The DD Form 139 also includes a statement that the consent agreement authorizing deduction from pay was signed by the  member.    The  servicing  FSO  notifies  the  member  and  processes  the  collection  with  a DS01 transaction in accordance with paragraph 71.6.4.1, 71.6.4.2, or 71.6.4.3. 71.8.  Other  Service  Exchange.  A  member  or  dependent  of  a  member  may  become indebted to the exchange of the Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard for charges or dishonored checks.    The  DoDFMR  authorizes  involuntary  collection  from  an  enlisted  member's  pay  for such  indebtedness  of  the  member; however, collection from any member's pay, if the debt was incurred by a dependent, may not be accomplished without the member's consent. 71.8.1.  Consent  Agreement.  An  exchange  may  require  a  member  to  sign  a  consent agreement  before  authorizing  charges  or  check-cashing privileges  for the  member  or  his or her dependent(s).  A consent agreement is a written statement authorizing deduction from pay for  the  debt.  The  agreement  must  be  a  clear  and  precise  authorization  containing  the member's SSN and must be signed and dated by the member.   The  consent agreement  may be  in  any  written  format  so  long  as  the  above  conditions  are  met.    The  consent  agreement may  be  withdrawn,  in  writing,  at  any  time  by  the  member;  however,  a  deduction  from  the member's  pay  is  authorized  for  the  specific  debt  incurred  under  the  agreement  before the date the written withdrawal is received by the exchange involved. 71.8.2.  Notification.    When  an  indebtedness  occurs,  the  member  should  be  notified  by  the exchange concerned and asked to make payment of the debt.  If the member refuses, does not make payment, or does not respond, the exchange notifies the member's unit commander for assistance in collection of the debt.  If the member is separating within 30 days, notification to  the  unit  commander  is  waived.  The  DD  Form  139  must  either  state  that  the  member's commander  was  notified  and  due  process  procedures,  as  provided  in  DODR  7000-14 Volumes  1  and  5,  were  completed,  or  have  attached  to  it  a  signed  consent  agreement.    If there  is  neither  the  required  statement  on  the  DD  Form  139  nor  signed  consent  agreement attached to it, return the DD Form 139 to the exchange requesting offset. 71.8.3.  Collection  of  Indebtedness  From  MMPA.   Review  the DD  Form  139 to  verify that the debt is proper and documentation complete.  No collection may be made for the debt of a dependent  of any member unless a consent agreement is provided.  Any FSO may input a valid  debt  on  the  MMPA  even  though  the  member  has  another  servicing  FSO.    The collection  must  be a one-time deduction unless the  debt exceeds two-thirds  pay.   When the debt  exceeds  two-thirds  pay,  at  least  two-thirds  pay  must  be  deducted  with  the  balance collected the next month. 1156 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 71.8.3.1.  Process a DS01 transaction with indebtedness type M and the D prefix company code of the exchange shown on Table 50. 71.8.3.2.  If the member is separating within 30 days, compute the amount of pay due the member  through  DOS,  including  any  accrued  leave  and  taking  into  consideration  any other known debts. Process a DS01 transaction for only the portion of the debt which may be collected from final pay. Use indebtedness type M and the D prefix company code of the exchange shown on Table 50. 71.8.3.3.  Return  a  posted  copy  of  the  DD  Form  139  to  the  exchange.    If  only  a portion of the indebtedness was collected, indicate on the DD Form 139 that the member has  insufficient  pay  to  make  full  collection,  the  amount  collected,  and  provide  the member's  future  mailing  address. When making the separation payment to the member, deduct  the  amount  of  specific  indebtedness  in  the  DS01  transaction  processed  for  the exchange indebtedness. 71.8.3.4.  When  the  member  disputes  collection  and  the  debt  was  properly  processed based on the DD Form 139, the member must contact the exchange to resolve the dispute. 71.8.4.  Nexcom  (Navy  Exchange  Service)  Debts.    Effective  1  September  2000  Navy Exchanges  (Nexcom)  will  be  authorized  to  process  DS  transactions  directly  against  Air Force MMPAs for Navy Exchange debts.   Effective 1 September 2000, Nexcom will advise their offices to begin the direct input and to cease issuing DD 139s to finance.  However, to take care  of the DD 139s already issued prior to the 1  September date, FSOs  may  continue to receive any new DD 139s received  prior to 15 September 2000 until 1 December 2000 if necessary.  However,  any  new  DD  139s  received  after  September  15,  2000  for  these  debts should be returned to the originating offices.  Nexcom has agreed to provide due process for these  debts  and  answer  questions  about  these  debts.    Members  questioning  these  debts should be instructed to call Nexcom at their toll free number 1-888-733-9566.  AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1157  Chapter 72 INDEBTEDNESS -NON AIR FORCE 72.1.  Description.  This  chapter  contains  information  on  federal  tax  levies,  Bankruptcy  and Wage Earner Plan, Air Force Aid Society and Article 139-UCMJ. 72.2.  Federal Tax Levies: 72.2.1.  DFAS  receives  a  notice  of  levy  (NOL)  from  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  DFAS  sends a  message  notice to the  servicing  FSO and  forwards parts 2-5 to the  FSO and monitors  and  posts  the  indebtedness.    Upon  receipt  of  the  NOL  message,  the  FSO  or representative will: 72.2.1.1.  Contact the member to whom the levy applies and ask the member to appear in the  FSO  within  3  workdays.    If  the  member  is  on  TDY  or  leave,  notify  DFAS  of  the expected  return  date.    If  the  member  will  be  TDY  and  will  not  return  within  14  days, notify the TDY FSO to contact the member to complete the necessary forms. 72.2.1.2.  The FSO or representative personally counsels the member on these points: 72.2.1.2.1.  The  levy  will  be applied against the individual's pay as  soon as  possible and continue until the levy is totally satisfied or released by IRS.  The law exempts a specific  amount  per  month  for  each authorized dependent included in the  TD Form 668-W, Part 3, Statement of Personal Exemptions and Filing Status, and an additional amount  per  month  for  the  member.  The  law  also  exempts  from  levy  as  much  of  a taxpayer's  wages  as  necessary  to  comply  with  a  judgment  by  a  court  of  competent jurisdiction,  entered  before  the  date  of  levy,  to  contribute  to  the  support  of  minor children. 72.2.1.2.2.  All  amounts  subject  to  levy,  as  determined  by  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A, paragraphs 440204 and 500110, will be sent to IRS. 72.2.1.2.3.  If this results in extreme hardship for the member, and the member wants to  establish  another  payment  rate,  or  if  the  member  feels  the  levy  is  incorrect,  the member contacts the IRS office originating the levy.  The member may arrange with IRS  for  the  installment  collection  of  delinquent  taxes.    See  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A, paragraph 440301.   Any new payment terms or waiver of levy is strictly between the member  and  IRS.    However,  this  does  not  stop  the  initial  deductions  from  the MMPA. 72.2.1.2.4.  The member must be given an opportunity to indicate the order in which voluntary  allotments  are  to  be  canceled,  if  he/she  desires,  to  repay  the  levy.  Allotment stoppage is voluntary except in cases identified by IRS. 72.2.1.2.5.  Obtain  a  signed  TD  Form  668-W,  parts  3  and  4  from  the  member.    The member  must  submit  a  new  TD  Form  668-W,  parts  3  and  4  if  the  number  of dependents changes during the levy collection period. 1158 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 72.2.1.3.  Supports a member's claim of a levy exemption by virtue of court-ordered child support with a copy of such court-ordered decree of judgment.  TD Forms 668-W can be obtained from the local IRS office if one is not furnished by DFAS. 72.2.1.4.  After obtaining the completed TD Form 668-W, notifies DFAS by message of the  number  of  dependents,  excluding  the  member  and  the  availability  of  the  levy exemption for court-ordered child support, with hardcopy to follow.  If member requests stoppage of allotments to repay levy, process appropriate transactions. 72.2.1.5.  Gives  the  member  a  copy  of  the  reverse  of  part  5,  TD  Form  668-W,  or  the instructions  as  written  in  Figure  72.2  before  requiring  completion  of  the  foregoing statement of personal exemptions. 72.2.1.6.  When the statement of personal exemptions or TD Form 668-W, parts 3, 4 and 5, has been completed, gives the member Part 5 and sends Parts 3 and 4 to DFAS. 72.2.1.7.  If  no  TD  Form  668-W  (Parts  3,  4,  and  5)  is  available,  types  on  8  1/2"  X  11" paper, in triplicate, the statement of exemptions as written in Figure 72.1. 72.2.2.  If the member has an NOL being deducted and files a current year return showing a refund due, IRS will normally use the refund to offset any prior tax levies.  IRS will do this for  any  payroll  deductions  not  received  from  DFAS-JFLTBC/IN.    The  member  receives  a notice of this action  from IRS and IRS  then  forwards either a partial  or  full release  of levy (ROL)  to  DFAS.    If  this  results  in  an  over-deduction  from  the  member,  DFAS  refunds  all money collected from the member but not disbursed.  If this does not satisfy the total of all deductions for the member, only IRS will refund the member, not DFAS. 72.2.3.  The levy  is  processed as a DS01 transaction  with indebtedness type N and the IRS D prefix company code. 72.3.  Bankruptcy and Wage Earner Plan.  There are two types of bankruptcies that a member may file with a court.  One is straight bankruptcy and the other is a Wage Earner Plan (WEP). 72.3.1.  Straight  Bankruptcy.    This  type  of  bankruptcy  is  filed  under  chapters  I  through VII of the Bankruptcy Act.  Debts listed on the bankruptcy petition may not be collected until the  court  has  ruled  on  the  petition.    The  debts  are  either  secured  or  unsecured.    However, debts on the member's MMPA are considered priority unsecured. 72.3.1.1.  A  copy  of  the  bankruptcy  petition  is  forwarded  to  DFAS-HGA/CL  by  the court's  bankruptcy  clerk.    If  the  FSO  receives  a  copy  of  the  petition,  contact  DFAS-HGA/CL to determine if they have received a copy.  The FSO should not stop collection of any debts. 72.3.1.2.  In some cases, the first notification that the member filed a petition is receipt of the  final  court  proceedings.    If  the  FSO  receives  a  copy  of  the  court  finding,  contact DFAS-HGA/CL to determine if they have received a copy. 72.3.1.3.  Upon  receipt  of  a  bankruptcy  order,  DFAS-HGA/CL  reviews  the  order  to determine  if  it  is  the  member's  petition  or  the  court's  final  proceedings.    The  member's current  MMPA  is  reviewed  to  determine  if  any  MMPA  debts  are  affected.    DFAS-IN/JFLTBB  will  take  any  action  needed  to  suspend,  cancel,  or  refund  any  amount collected from the date of the filing of the petition. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1159  72.3.1.4.  If  the  order  is  the  initial  petition,  DFAS  prepares  a  United  States  Bankruptcy  Court  proof  of  claim  and  forwards  it  to  DFAS-HGA/CL  and  AFLOA/JACQ.  AFLOA/JACQ sends the documentation to the United States Attorney, in the area where the  member  filed  the  bankruptcy,  to  represent  the  Air  Force  in  any  court  proceedings.  For further information, contact your local Judge Advocate’s office. 72.3.1.5.  Any  debt  created  after  the  date  the  bankruptcy  was  filed  is  not  part  of  the bankruptcy.    However,  if  the  overpayment  date  of  the  debt  is  before  the  filing  of  the bankruptcy,  and  the  debt  is  listed  on  the  petition,  the  debt  is  considered  a  part  of  the bankruptcy even though the debt has not yet been posted to the MMPA.  The FSO must notify DFAS of any bankruptcy debts not yet posted to the MMPA. 72.3.1.6.  If the  debt is  not listed on the  petition, no  stoppage, cancellation, or refund is made  until  the  member  has  petitioned  the  court  for  an  amendment  and  DFAS  has received a copy of the amendment. 72.3.1.7.  If  a  debt  for  excess  cost  of  household  goods  (HHG),  trailer  move,  or  hold baggage  is  a  part  of  the  bankruptcy  and  additional  excess  cost  is  received  later  for  the same  PCS  move,  the  additional  excess  cost  is  considered  part  of  the  bankruptcy.    The FSO must notify DFAS upon receipt of a new DD Form 139. 72.3.2.  Wage  Earner  Plan  (WEP).    This  type  of  bankruptcy  is  filed  under  chapter  XIII  of the  Bankruptcy  Act, as amended  by  the Bankruptcy Reform  Act  of 1978.   Under  WEP,  the member  agrees  to  pay  all  of  his  or  her  commercial  and  government  debts,  but  the accumulated  monthly  payments  have  placed  the  member  in  a  financial  hardship.    The member  petitions  the  court  to  make  a  repayment  of  debts at a lower rate.   The  creditor,  by accepting the WEP, waives all rights to any interest charge and may have to accept less than 100  percent  of  the  debt.  The  court  appoints  a  trustee  to  receive  the  member's  pay  and distribute the pay to the creditor. 72.3.2.1.  Upon  receipt  of  the  court-approved  WEP  from  the  DFAS-HGA/CL,  DFAS-IN/JFLTBB sends a message notifying the servicing FSO that a court approved WEP has been  received.    The  message  will  state  the  total  amount  of  the  WEP,  the  monthly deduction amount and the month the deduction will  begin.  DFAS-IN/JFLTBB processes a  DS01,  indebtedness  type  B,  with  the  appropriate  D  company  code  to  start  the deduction. 72.3.2.2.  The FSO may not at any time process a DS transaction that will cause a WEP to be started or altered in any way.  If the FSO receives any court documents concerning a  WEP,  the  documents  must  be  immediately  forwarded  to  DFAS-IN/JFLTBB  through DFAS-HGA/CL. 72.3.2.3.  United  States  debts  accumulated  after  the  WEP  have  priority  for  deduction over the WEP. 72.3.3.  WEP  and  Straight  Bankruptcy.    If  a  member  has  a  WEP  and  is  filing  a  straight bankruptcy,  the  FSO  must  immediately  forward  the  court  document  to  DFAS-IN/JFLTBB through DFAS-HGA/CL so that the WEP deduction can be stopped. 1160 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 72.3.4.  Alimony and Child  Support Payments.   A  member  cannot  claim alimony and  child support  payments  as  part  of  a  bankruptcy  even  though  the  payments  were  caused  by  a garnishment of wages. 72.4.  Recoupment  of  Monies  Owed  Air  Force  Aid  Society  (AFAS)  From  Final Pay.  Approximately 5 to 10 days prior to separation, AFAS will provide the FSO with an AFAS Form 9 (original and 3 copies) for those members AFAS wishes to collect from.  The AFAS Form 9 will certify that due process requirements have been met by AFAS and request collection of a specified amount from the member's final pay. Upon receipt of the AFAS Form 9, the FSO will: 72.4.1.  Complete  block  9  of  the  form.    Block  9  will  show  the  amount  determined  by  the FSO to be available for collection of the debt.  The deduction amount will be that portion of the amount  shown  in block 7 which the FSO determines is available for collection from the member's final pay only.  The order of precedence shown in the DoDFMR, Volume 7A, table 52-1, will be used. 72.4.2.  Complete  block 10 of the  form.  (DJMS Input)  This  will  be the amount  of the debt remaining after the FSO deduction (block 8 minus block 9). 72.4.3.  Acknowledge the transaction by signing in block 12. 72.4.4.  Deduct  the  debt  from  the  member's  final  pay  only  using  a  DS  transaction  to Company Code D000709, use indebtedness type V. 72.4.5.  When  member  out-processes  through  the  FSO  have  member  sign  in  Block  13.    (If member refuses to  sign block 14, or  does  not  out-process through  Accounting and Finance, annotate this fact on the Form 9.  However, in either of these cases, the collection should be processed). 72.4.6.  Retain the original copy of AFAS Form 9 as a supporting document. 72.4.7.  Provide the last copy to the member and return the  second and fourth copies to the AFAS section. 72.5.  Article  139,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice.  An  Air  Force  member  becoming indebted  to  a  non-government  activity  may  have  collection  action  taken  per  AFI  51-501, chapter  5.    The  FSO  should  process  a  DS01  transaction  with  indebtedness  type  code  V  and  a one-time  collection,  providing  the  member's pay account  has sufficient pay available  for a one-time  collection.  Otherwise,  process a DS01 transaction to provide  for  prompt  collection  of the debt.    The  FSO's  D  prefix  company  code  should  be  used  in  the  DS01  transaction.    When  the FSO  receives  the  Detail  Supporting  DJMS-AC  Miscellaneous  Deductions  Report at  the  end of the month, deposit the funds in 57F3875, Budget Clearing Account (Suspense) Air Force.  Then prepare an SF 1049, Public Voucher for Refund, to issue a check to the non-government activity.  Provide a complete explanation on the SF 1047 for the payment. 72.6.  Bank  of  America  Travel  Card  Debts.  The  travel  and  transportation  reform  act  of 1998  (PL 105-264)  established  policies  for  DoD  to  collect  travel  card  delinquent  debts.   The current  contract  for  travel  card  use  is  with  the  Bank  of  America  (BOA).    Once  a  travel  card debt is unpaid over 90 days, the company must provide the member with due process at the last known  address.  If  no  response  within  the  next  30  days,  the  debt  is  referred  to  DFAS  for collection action (now 120 days delinquent).   Reference DoDFMR, Vol 7A, 500104B. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1161  72.6.1.  BOA forwards a file of debts to DFAS-AHA/CL (Project Management Office) once a  month  to  start  collection  action  via  the  Salary  Offset  Program.  DFAS-CL  identifies members on this list having an active DJMS-AC account and refers the debt collection start actions to DJMS-AC. 72.6.2.  The  Salary  Offset  Program  automatically  establishes  a  DS  type  T  debt, company  code  D410742,  against  the  member’s  pay  account  computing  15%  of  disposable pay.  At  the  same  time  the  program  sends  the  member  a  courtesy  “Notice  of  Collection Action”  letter  telling  members  to  call  BOA  with  any  inquiries  and  sends  a  management notice to the FSO. 72.6.3.  DFAS  is  without  authority  to  adjudicate  debts  on  behalf  of  BOA.    The  member must work directly with BOA to correct any discrepancies. 72.6.4.  If  BOA  receives  payment  in  full  and  wishes  to  discontinue  collection  action,  they send  a  stop  collection  request  to  DFAS-CL.    DFAS-CL  forwards  a  weekly  listing  of accounts, to DJMS-AC, for automatic  stop actions.   This  stop  process normally takes  sixty days to complete from the time the debt is paid in full at BOA. 72.6.5.  All refunds  of amounts  over-collected,  or collected in  error, are refunded  directly to the member by BOA. 72.7.  Treasury  Offset  Program  (TOP).  The  Debt  Collection  Improvement  Act  of  1996 requires all  federal agencies to have TOP collect any debts due them.  The agency must provide due process notice of the debt to the member’s last known address.  TOP debts follow the same salary offset procedures as BOA debts (see paragraph 72.6 above). 72.7.1.  The  system  automatically  establishes  DS  type  T  debts,  company  code  D411955, for TOP debts. 72.7.2.  Members  must  contact  the  treasury  offset  program  office  at  (800)  304-3107  for  all inquiries.  DFAS  cannot  administer  these  debts.    All  negotiations  must  go  through  TOP  to the federal agency holding the debt. 1162 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 72.1.  Member's Instructions for Preparing Statement of Personal Exemptions. THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE GIVEN TO THE MEMBER BEFORE COMPLETING THE STATEMENT OF PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS ON TD FORM 668-W:            (Extracted From Part 7, TD Form 668-W) "Instructions:  A levy was served on the person named on the front of this form.  The information you provide on this form will be used by that person to figure the amount of your income that the law exempts from levy.  You are allowed $325 each month as a personal exemption for yourself.  You are also allowed an exemption of $108.33 a month for each person you list as an exemption on this form." "1.   If you are married and provide over one-half of your spouse's support, enter your spouse's name.  If you provide over one-half of the support of any of the individuals listed below, enter their names also.  If you are required by a court judgment (made before the date of this levy) to contribute to the support of your minor children, then the amount of your wages, salary, or other income necessary to comply with the judgment is already exempt from the levy, and such minor children should not be listed as exemptions. (a)   your son, daughter, or grandchild,  (b)   your stepson or stepdaughter, (c)   your brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister (d)   your father, mother, or grandparent,  (e)   your stepfather or stepmother, (f)   a nephew or niece related by blood,  (g)   an uncle or aunt related by blood, (h)   your son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law, or brother-in-law, (i)  a person (other than your spouse) who is living in your home as a member of your household during the applicable pay periods." "2.   Please complete Parts 5, 6, and 7; sign and date them.  Keep Part 7 for your records.  Give parts 5 and 6 to your payroll officer or timekeeper, as instructed, within 3 work-days from the date you received them. If you do not complete and submit this form, you will be allowed only the $325 personal exemption from levy." "3.   If the number of your exemptions changes during the time the levy is in effect, please file another Statement of Exemptions with the person on whom the levy was served.  You can get more forms from an Internal Revenue Service office." "4.

Description.  A military member or his or her Commander may apply for remission of an indebtedness  to  the  United  States.  The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  may  have  remitted  or cancelled  any  part  of  a  member’s  indebtedness  to  the  United  States  Air  Force  or  any instrumentality  of the  United  States, incurred while the member was serving on active duty, if he/she considers it to be in the best interest of the United States. Generally, any indebtedness may be  considered  for  remission  including  those  listed  in  the DoDFMR,  Vol 7A, tables 50-1, 50-3, and  50-4.  Debts  may  be  processed  for  remission  even  if  relief  action  has  been  denied  under appeal provisions first. The debt must be within Air Force jurisdiction. 73.2.  Substantiating Documents: 73.2.1.  DD  Form  2789.    Member  furnishes  all  information  required  on  DD  Form  2789, Waiver/ Remission of Indebtedness Application, Section I.  (See Figure 73.1) 73.2.2.  AF  Form  2451.    Member  completes  AF  Form  2451,  Financial  Statement--Remission  of  Indebtedness,  Section  I  (see  Figure  73.2),  if  hardship  is  a  factor,  and furnishes proof of monthly installment payments.  Do not list deductions for bonds, savings, and IRA. 73.3.  FSO: 73.3.1.  Ensures  all  blocks  of  DD  Form  2789  are  completed  and  requests  clarification  if necessary.  Completes  DD  Form  2789,  section  II.  (See  Figure  73.1)  These  documents  are essential  to  the  processing  of  remission  cases;  therefore,  it  is  imperative  they  be  included. The  FSO  should  ensure  that  blocks  21  and  23,  section  II  of  the  DD  Form  2789  have meaningful  statements  based  on  the  merits  of  the  case.  A  statement,  such  as  the  member should pay because he or she owes, is insufficient as it does not consider good faith, hardship, or  other aspects  of the  case. The  Air  Force Financial Services Center (AFFSC) advises the Office  of  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SAF/MRB)  whether  they  agree  with  the  FSO's recommendation, attaching the following documents and information pertaining to the debt: AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1165  Table 73.1.  replace with the following: Documents:    1.  Proof of court decision and proof of payment for  alimony and/or child support  2.  Debt rebuttal and appeal documents to include the final determination.  3.  Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)  4.  Debt source documents and a detailed debt computation.  5.

If the debt resulted from erroneous payment of BAH.  Paydate changes for doctors.   10.  DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization.    11.  DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Sub-voucher.  12.  AF Form 1613, Statement of Service.  13.  DD Form 139 and provide total amount of unauthorized accessorial charges.  14.  Proof of payment of alimony and/or child support for the complete period of the debt.  15.  HPSP contract           1166 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 73.3.2.  If  member  has  submitted  AF  Form  2451,  verifies  that  installment  amounts  are  the minimum  required  by  the  creditors  and  the  expiration  dates  of  installment  payments  are correct.    If  necessary,  change or delete amounts and  dates.    Also, amounts for medical and dental  expenses  must  be  validated  and  explained.  Complete  AF  Form  2451,  Section  II, (see  Figure  73.2)  and  attach  proof  of  installment  payments  and  proof  of  child  support  or alimony, if applicable. 73.3.3.  If member refuses to submit an AF Form 2451, he or she should be advised that the remission  request  will  then  be  considered  without  regard  to  any  mitigating  information concerning  ability  to  pay  that  might  be  included  in  the  application.    Member  must acknowledge in writing that he or she has been so advised. 73.3.4.  Contact  the  unit  commander  only  if  there  are  unusual  factors  regarding  the member which would have a bearing on the case.  Input will be accepted in letter format. 73.3.5.  Ensure  the  debt  is  processed  and  suspended  on  the  master  military  pay  account (MMPA).  Initiate  action  to  withhold  pay,  if  appropriate,  as  outlined  in  Chapter  66, paragraph 66.3. 73.3.6.  Within  30  days  of  receipt  from  member,  transmit  remission  application  with supporting  documentation  in  original  and  one  copy  to  the  AFFSC.    Scan  the  remission application  and  supporting  documents,  attaching  the  completed  application  file  to  an  email submitted  to  affsc.remission@ellsworth.af.mil.    Keep  a  complete  copy  of  remission package in the FSO management case file (MCF).  (See  paragraph 69.9.)  MAJCOM/FMF functions  are  not  required  to  routinely  review  remission  cases  but  may  choose  to  become involved.    If  group  submission,  contact  the  AFFSC,  at  the  above  email  address  before processing. 73.3.7.  If  member's  date  of  separation  (DOS)  is  within  90  days,  annotate  on  the  front  of DD Form 2789 "PRIORITY-DOS (date)." 73.3.8.  (DELETED) 73.4.  AFFSC: 73.4.1.  Following  receipt  of the  completed remission application,  the  AFFSC Remissions section  reviews the application and the member’s MMPA, prepares an administrative report with  their  recommendations,  and  submits  the  case,  using  the  Case  Management  Tracking System (CMTS), to SAF/ MRB for final adjudication. 73.4.2.  Upon  receipt  of  the  SAF/MRB  decision,  AFFSC  processes  appropriate  input transactions  into  DJMS.  For  miscellaneous-type  debts,  AFFSC  prepares  a  DD  Form  139 and  forwards it to the  company code assigned to the debt. The AFFSC notifies the FSO, via email  message, of the final determination.  The  FSO  notifies  the  member,  via  email  or  a copy  of  the  DD  Form  139,  whichever  is appropriate. The FSO  can increase  the  pay rate established  on  the  DD  Form  139  if  the  member  concurs.  A  request  for  decreases  in  rates below  the  amount  in  the  remission  decision  must  be  forwarded  to  the  AFFSC.  The  FSO provides  comment on the reasonableness of the request. If  hardship is  the basis, a financial statement must be submitted. 73.5.  Special Provisions.  Re-application  for Remission. Once a  determination has  been  made, the  SAF/  MRB  does  not  review  a  re-submission  unless  there  is  additional  information  or  a AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1167  changed financial situation. If there is additional information, documentation, or new evidence it should be forwarded in writing to the AFFSC. Section 73B—Waivers. 73.6.  General.  Public  Law  92-453,  10  U.S.C.  2774,  and  DoDI  1340.23,  prescribe standards  for  the  waiver  of  claims  of  the  United  States  against  a  member  arising  out  of  an erroneous  payment  of  pay  and  allowances  including  travel  or  transportation  allowance  made after 28  Dec 1985,  if  recovery  is  determined to be against equity and  good conscience and not in the best interests of  the  United  States. Generally,  these  criteria  will  be  met  by  a  finding  that the  erroneous  payment  occurred  through  administrative  error  and  that  there  is  no  indication  of fraud,  misrepresentation,  fault,  or  lack  of  good  faith  on  the  part  of  the  member  or  any  other person having an interest in obtaining a waiver of the claim. 73.6.1.  Application  for  waiver  must  be  received  by  the  Department  of  Hearings  and Appeals  (DOHA)office  of  the  Comptroller  General,  or  the  department  concerned,  within  5 years from the date the erroneous payment was discovered. Date of discovery for starting the 5-year  period  is  the  date  that  an  appropriate  official  first  definitely  determines  that  an erroneous payment has been made. 73.6.2.  DFAS-JFEAB/IN initiates refund action on any amount due the member. 73.7.  Substantiating  Documents.  Member  completes  DD  Form  2789,  Waiver/Remission  of Indebtedness  Application,  Section  I.    (See  Figure  73.1)    All  information  requested  must  be furnished, including negative replies. Failure to furnish complete and accurate details may cause the return of the application to the member and delay waiver action. 73.8.  FSO: 73.8.1.  Screens  the  entries  in  Section  I  of  DD  Form  2789,  clarifies  any  discrepancies, ensures  the  Commander’s  blocks  on  page  2  (blocks  20-22)  are  completed,  and  completes Section II of DD Form 2789 (see Figure 73.1).  Attaches supporting documents, including a detailed debt computation. 73.8.1.1.  (DELETED) 73.8.1.2.  (DELETED) 73.8.1.3.  (DELETED) 73.8.2.

Keep  a  complete  copy  of  waiver  package  in  the  FSO  management  case  file.  (See  paragraph  69.10.)   Waiver  packages  may  also  be  submitted,  via  email,  to remissionwaiverindy@dfas.mil.    MAJCOM/FMF  functions  are  not  required  to  routinely review waiver cases but FMF may choose to become involved.  If group submission, contact JFEAB before processing. 73.8.3.  If notification has not been received on adjudication, and no N9 memo entry reflects action, follow up with DFAS-JFEAB/IN after 45 days from date of submission. 1168 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 73.9.  DFAS-IN: 73.9.1.  JFEAB  receives  waiver  application  and  opens  the  case  on  the  Defense  Debt Management System (DDMS). 73.9.2.  After  notification  of  waiver  decision  is  received,  JFEAB  accomplishes  input  of appropriate transactions to DJMS. For miscellaneous-type debts, JFEAB prepares a DD Form 139 and forwards it to the company code assigned to the debt. The FSO and the member are provided  information  on the  final determination  by letter. DFAS-JFEAB/IN initiates refund action on any amount due the member. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1169  Figure 73.1.

Any  written  request  or  inquiry  for  pay  and  allowances  due.  When  the  input  source  can  determine  entitlement,  they  handle  the  transaction  as  a retroactive adjustment and submit a regular DJMS input transaction.  The inquiry procedure (Chapter 5) can be used to determine previous periods of entitlements credited to member's account. 74.1.2.  Out-of-Service Claim.  Any request or inquiry for additional pay and allowances due from the Air Force for a separated member.  Also, any action by the Air Force that results in additional pay or allowances due a separated member. 74.1.3.  Previous  Service  Claim.    Any  request  or  inquiry  for  pay  and  allowances  due  for  a period of previous service from an Air Force member who was separated and had a break in service of 1 day or more.  Regular DJMS input cannot be used for a period of prior service regardless of time factors involved.  These claims are processed the same as in-service claims sent to DFAS-JFE/IN. 74.1.4.  Doubtful Claim.  Generally a doubtful claim is one involving a question of propriety of payment rather than adequacy of documentation.  A doubtful claim is a claim in which the agency,  rather  than  the  claimant,  is  not  sure  whether  the  claim  should  be  paid.  A  claim  is doubtful  when  in  the  exercise  of  reasonable  prudence  either  a  person  having  final responsibility  for  deciding  appropriate  administrative  action  or  the  person  who,  in accordance with applicable statutes, will be held accountable if the claim were paid and then found to  be incorrect, illegal,  or  improper, is unable  to decide  with reasonable certainty the validity and correctness of the claim. 74.1.5.  Travel and Transportation Allowances. Follow procedures in AFI 65-114. 74.1.6.  Shipment  of  Personal  Property  Claim.    Any  request  to  the  Defense  Office  of Hearings  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  for  a  refund  of  an  amount  previously  collected  for  excess cost of a shipment of personal property. 74.1.7.  Advance Decision. See DoDFMR, Vol 5, chapter 25. 74.1.8.  Appeal  (Reclaim).  When  a  member  is  not  satisfied  with  the  determination  of  the agency adjudicating  his/her  claim,  the  member  may  appeal  the  determination  to  the  claims group,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals.    In  an  appeal  (or  reclaim),  the  agency position is clear,  which usually involves a determination that the claim should not be paid. 74.2.  Supporting Documents for In-Service Claims: 74.2.1.  When member believes he or she is due additional pay or allowance, the member: 74.2.1.1.  Prepares a claim letter which includes: 74.2.1.1.1.  Date prepared. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1173  74.2.1.1.2.  Identification  of  items  claimed,  period(s)  involved,  and  amounts,  if available. 74.2.1.1.3.  Claimant's signature and SSN. 74.2.1.2.  Attaches any documents that support payment. 74.2.1.3.  Submits claim to the FSO. 74.2.2.  FSO Actions.  FSO reviews claim, and: 74.2.2.1.  Verifies previous periods of entitlement credited to  member's account through inquiry  procedures (Chapter  5).  If a determination can  be made regarding  entitlement, prepare a regular DJMS input transaction and submit to AFFSC for processing if already cutover or do the input if not.   Attach claim to substantiating document. 74.2.2.2.  If adjudication of claim requires verification of creditable service beyond local capability,  request  verification  directly  from  HQ  AFPC/DPPA.    They  either  forward input  to  DFAS  for  adjustment  of  member's  account  or  advise  member  that  claim  is invalid. 74.2.2.3.  Submission  of  claim  to  DFAS-IN/JFE  presumes  that  information  cannot  be obtained  from  AFAFO  through  inquiry  channels  or  from  other  sources.    Before submitting a claim that does not have enough information or documentation, try to obtain missing information or documentation. 74.2.2.3.1.  If an interpretation of policy or legislation is required, MAJCOM submits a request to  AFAFO  to  obtain the interpretation.   Once the  missing  interpretation of policy  or  legislation  has  been  obtained,  FSO  either  forwards  input  to  DFAS  for adjustment of member’s account or advises member that claim is invalid. 74.2.2.3.2.  If, after trying to obtain missing information or documentation, the claim still does not have enough information or documentation, submit to DFAS-IN through MAJCOM for submission of a doubtful claim to DOHA. 74.2.2.3.3.  For  either  74.2.2.3.1  or  74.2.2.3.2  above documentation: include the  following 74.2.2.3.3.1.  signed claim and any supporting documents and, 74.2.2.3.3.2.  a letter  of transmittal  stating:  facts  surrounding claim,  statement  of questions  to  be  resolved,  FSO’s  recommendations  concerning  payment  and reason, or reasons for no specific recommendation. 74.2.2.3.4.  If  member  wishes  to  submit  an  appeal  of  an  agency  determination  (see definition  of  appeal  in  paragraph  74.1),  submit  package  (including  agency’s determination) to DFAS-IN for submission to DOHA. 74.2.2.4.  If  the  claim  involves  questionable  marriages  or  validation  of  with-dependent rate BAH received  on  behalf of a purported  spouse,  submit as  doubtful  claim to DFAS-JMOB/DE. Refer to the JFTR, Chapter 10, Housing Allowances for additional guidance and information. 1174 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 74.3.  Excess Cost on a Shipment of Personal Property.  A claim may only be submitted for an account which has previously been collected.  Any amount not collected may not be included in the claim. 74.3.1.  Substantiating  Documents.    When  a  member  believes  he  or  she  is  due  an  amount which was collected for excess cost, the member: 74.3.1.1.  Prepares a claim letter which includes: 74.3.1.1.1.  Date prepared. 74.3.1.1.2.  Identification of period involved, amount claimed and reason for claim. 74.3.1.1.3.  Date of rebuttal to JPPSO-SAT/ECAF.   Attach copy of complete rebuttal package  with  determination.  If  rebuttal  was  not  submitted,  explain  in  detail  why  a rebuttal to the claim was not submitted before. 74.3.1.1.4.  If  member  is  enlisted,  state  whether  a  remission  application  was submitted and date.   Attach a copy of the remission application and adjudicated DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization. 74.3.1.1.5.  Claimant’s signature and SSN. 74.3.1.2.  Attaches any documents which support claim. 74.3.1.3.  Submits claim to FSO. 74.3.2.  FSO  Actions.  Reviews  the  claim  and  ensures  all  applicable  information  is included.  Completes  the  claim    per  DoDFMR,  Vol  5.  Prepares  a  transmittal  letter addressed  to  AFAFO  and  JPPSO-SAT/ECAF  in  turn.  Then  forwards  the  complete  claim package to AFAFO or the MAJCOM, if so directed by the MAJCOM. The  debt may not be suspended when the claim is submitted. 74.3.3.  DFAS Actions on Claims from Separated Members. 74.3.3.1.  DFAS-JFE/IN settles claims from separated members, unless account is still in the  computer,  then  the  claim(s)  are  processed  by  DFAS-IN.    FSO  assists  separated member in filing claim if the claimant contacts the FSO. 74.3.3.2.  DFAS-IN/JFE  either  settles  member's  claim  or  forwards  it  to  Claims  Group-GGD,  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and  Appeals,  Washington  DC  20548-0001,  for  final settlement.  DFAS-IN follows up on unsettled DOHA claim 6 months after claim is sent to  DOHA  and  every  6  months  thereafter  until  claim  is  settled.    DFAS-IN  sends  status report to MAJCOM that submitted claim after reply is received from DOHA. 74.4.  Claims  Involving  Agencies  Outside  Air  Force.  Process  as  prescribed  by  the  agency concerned. 74.5.  Claims Sent to DFAS-IN/JFE. 74.5.1.

Determine if member is  due  payment.    If  so,  either  make  payment  and  report  transaction  or  release authorization into next regular payment by processing a PQ26 transaction.  If member is not due payment, take necessary action to have MMPA corrected (contact MPS, DFAS, etc.).    Erroneous  entitlements  generated  from  reenlistment  or  separation  require  DFAS action.   1176 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 75 SAVE PAY 75.1.  Description.  SAVE  PAY  is  a  taxable  (FICA/FITW/SITW)  monthly  entitlement  paid whenever Congressional Act or policy decision provides an additional amount of money to avoid a  reduction  in  pay.  The  rate  of  SAVE  PAY  is  determined  by  the  language  contained  in  the Congressional Act or policy decision affecting the specific event or type. 75.2.  Types.  Currently SAVE PAY is provided to: 75.2.1.  Physicians'  Assistants  These  members  are  previously  senior  noncommissioned officers  who  are  commissioned  as  physicians'  assistants.    SAVE  PAY  ensures  that  the member's gross pay as an 01 is not less than what it was as an enlisted member. 75.2.2.  Physicians  These  members  are  authorized  SAVE  PAY  by  the  Uniformed  Services Health Professions Act of 1980, implemented 1 July 1980.  This Act reallocated the medical special pay for physicians and  provided  that  no  physician  would  receive less  than the total of medical special pays and basic pay to which they were entitled before the Act. 75.2.3.  Former  Warrant  Officers  These  members  are  former  warrant  officers  of  another service,  who,  without a break  of  service,  entered the  Air  Force as a  commissioned  officer. SAVE PAY ensures the commissioned officer pay is not less than the previous warrant officer pay. 75.2.4.  OTS  Graduates  or  Direct  Commissions  NCOs  are  accepted to  OTS  and commissioned upon graduation.   Their gross pay as officers cannot be less than what it was while holding their enlisted grade. 75.2.5.  Dental Officers These officers were authorized SAVE PAY by DoD Directive 1340.8, dated 21 Feb 1986.  The directive stipulates that a dental officer who is entitled to special pay under 37 USC 302b (reference (b))  shall be entitled to  such  pay effective  1 Oct 1985 in an annual amount that is not less  than  the  total  annual  amount  of  dental  continuation  pay  and special  pay  for  dental  officers  under  former  sections  311  and  302b  of  reference  (b), respectively, to which that officer was entitled on 30 Sep 1985. 75.3.  Source  of  Input.  FID  09  input  is  restricted  to  DFAS-DE.  If  a  transaction  affects  an entitlement  for  the  specific  SAVE  PAY  type,  a  processed  for  review  management  notice  is generated to DFAS-DE/FJPAD for determination of the impact of the transaction on SAVE PAY and necessary adjustments. 75.4.  Interface  with  Accessions.  If a  FID  E203 is received containing a  Prior-Service-Grade-Code  of  W  (Warrant  Officer),  the  accession  subsystem  provides  an  MQY  management notice  to  DFAS-DE.  DFAS-DE/FJ  obtains  the  member's  records  from  the  other  service  to prepare a SAVE PAY calculation. (Warrant officers are paid as staff sergeants while in OTS.  The SAVE PAY is not effective until the actual commission is received.) 75.5.  Interface  with  Change  of  Category  (E6).  If  an  E603  is  processed  and  the  member  is changing  category  (enlisted  to  officer  or  officer  to  enlisted),  an  MRB  management  notice  is received at DFAS-DE to indicate the member has received a commission and may be entitled to SAVE  PAY.  DFAS-DE/FJ  computes  any  SAVE  PAY  and  inputs  the  09  transaction.    If,  in  the AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1177  case  of  a  prior  warrant  officer,  the  E6  has  not  processed  in  75  days  from  the  E2,  a  suspense transaction is rejected to DFAS-DE/FJ for review. 1178 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 76 VOUCHER PROCESSING, DISPOSITION AND BALANCING 76.1.  Description.  The  value  of  money  lists  or  payment  vouchers,  covering  payrolls reported through  financial  returns  of  DAOs,  are  automatically  compared,  at  the  central  site,  against the  actual  value  of  money  lists  or  payrolls,  and  discrepancies  disclosed  are  properly  adjusted.  Internal review and administrative examination procedures are applied to ensure that the system is  operating  as  intended,  to  disclose  and  correct  any  system  weaknesses,  to  detect  and  adjust overpayments and underpayments and to ensure that  military  service  stewardship responsibility for  government  funds is  properly  discharged.  These  procedures  will pay  particular attention to detection of, and prompt action in, fraud cases. 76.2.  Substantiating Documents: 76.2.1.  DD Form 117, Military Pay Voucher, used to summarize these types of payments: 76.2.1.1.  Locally  authorized  payments  made  to  Air  Force  members  and  recorded  on AF Form 265, AFO Payment Authorization (JUMPS), (advances, partials, etc.). 76.2.1.2.  Centrally authorized payments on one-time pay authorizations (reenlistment bonus increments, variable reenlistment bonus increments, etc.). 76.2.2.  DD Form 397, Claim Certification and Voucher for Death Gratuity Payment, used to pay  designated  beneficiaries  of  deceased  members,  when  supported  by  all  legal documents required per Chapter 54. 76.2.3.  SF  1034,  Public  Voucher  for  Purchases  and  Services  Other  than  Personal,  used  to pay prior service members a clothing monetary allowance, initial (CMAI), etc. 76.2.4.  DD  Form  1131,  Cash  Collection  Voucher,  supported  by  required  documents designating purpose of collection and other data necessary to process transaction. 76.2.5.  SF  1098,  Schedule  of  Canceled  or  Undelivered  Checks,  used  to  identify  service member when processing collection transaction. 76.2.6.  DD Form 1351-6, Multiple Payments List, used to support multiple payments on one voucher. 76.3.  Voucher Numbering Scheme: 76.3.1.  Disbursing Vouchers. 76.3.1.1.  Finance numbers all manual vouchers and automated vouchers generated out of normal  mid-month  and  end-of-month  payrolls  for  off-line  payments  with  consecutive numbers  beginning  with  0000001  each  new  FY;  prefix  each  number  with  letter  P (P0000001). 76.3.1.2.  The Base  Accounts Receivable  System (BARS)  generates a  voucher  for  those members  having  voluntary  payroll  deductions  for  accounts  receivable  debts.    These vouchers  have  an  I-series  prefix  and  generate  a  PK03  for  posting  to  the  member's MMPA. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1179  76.3.1.3.  Finance  numbers  all  disbursement  vouchers  for  automated  daily  payments (Example: one-time bonuses) made at central site with consecutive numbers beginning with 000001 each new FY; prefix each number with letters KA (KA000001). 76.3.2.  Collection  Vouchers.  Finance  assigns  voucher  numbers  to  all  collection  vouchers prepared in finance.   When military  pay collections are made directly to cashier, the cashier obtains a collection voucher number from finance.  Numbers are consecutive beginning with 000001 each new FY; prefix each number with letters CP (CP000001). 76.3.3.  Voucher  Control  Logs.    Finance  maintains  a  log  of  all  disbursement  vouchers certified  for  payment,  and  a  separate  log  of  collection  vouchers.    These  logs  list  each voucher  number  assigned  in  numerical  sequence.    All  numbers  must  be  accounted  for.  Voucher numbers not used for any reason must be fully explained on the log. 76.3.4.  Number  of  Copies  and  Distribution.  Prepare  pay  vouchers  and  supporting documents in at least an original and two copies for distribution: 76.3.4.1.  Original -to DFAS-DE with original money accounts. 76.3.4.2.  First copy -to DAO-retained accounts. 76.3.4.3.  Second  copy  -retained  by  FSO  for answering inquiries.  An additional  copy is required when vouchers are prepared by an accounting and disbursing agent or disbursing agent.  An additional copy is required for DFAS-DE when an installation cannot provide machine-sensitive  data to DFAS-DE.    In this  event, DFAS-DE  will input  payment  and collection data for entry to the MMPA. 76.4.  Voucher  Preparation.  Supporting  attachments  prepared  per  instructions  in  Chapter 2 must  be  examined  closely  for  completeness  before  summary  information  is  inserted  on vouchers.   Do  not  prepare  vouchers  for  over or underpayments  of  less  than $1.  In instances  of underpayment, the member should be contacted to see if payment is desired.  Complete voucher contents as follows: 76.4.1.  Enter  detail  accounting  classification  breakout  by  amount  for  processing  DJMS, MAFR, and  IBP.  NOTE:  Only the  current  fiscal  year is available (authorized)  when  citing 57*3500 program 510, 530 or project 561. 76.4.2.  Record  the  purpose  of  the  payment  or  collection  on  the  voucher  being  processed. The  DD  Form  1351-6  or  a  supplemental  machine  listing  is  attached  to  a  DD  Form  117  to support  multiple  payments  on  one  voucher.  Single  payments  (to  one  member)  may  be reported  on  DD  Form  117  without  a  supporting  DD  Form  1351-6.  Show  member's  name, SSN, etc., in open block on form. 76.4.3.  Assign document control number per Chapter 2. 76.4.4.  Make sure detail amounts supporting voucher equal total amount. 76.5.  Voucher Total Input Transactions.  For each payment voucher, a PZ total transaction is required  for  the total  of all 510  payments and one  for the total of all 530  payments (FIDs PA, PC, PD, PF, PG, PJ, PK, PL, PM, PQ, PV) on the voucher.  Likewise, for each collection voucher, a C9 is required for the total of all 510 collections and one for all 530 collections (C1 and/or C2) on the voucher.   Payment  or  collection inputs  for TLA (PS), initial  clothing allowance (PT),  or death  gratuity  payment  (PE)  do  not  require  a  total  card.    These  payments  or  collections  are 1180 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 made  from  other  than  budget program 510/530 and are memorandum entries not reconciled in voucher balancing.  The format for reporting voucher total transactions is shown in Figure 76.8  For  any  payment  requiring  a  PZ  transaction,  input  the  PZ  and  related  detail  (detail  refers  to  a posting  to  an  individual  MMPA)  in  the  first  DJMS  update  after  the  day  of  payment.  For  the total and  detail transactions to successfully  balance in DJMS, the  sum of  the  detail transactions must equal the total record.  Figure 76.1 is an example of a military pay summary voucher. 76.6.  Voucher Balancing.  The Voucher Balancing/Merged Accountability and Fund Reporting (MAFR) Reconciliation  Report (UH099C0809)  is the  basic  tool  provided  the DAOs  to  assist in  fulfilling  their  responsibility  for  proper  and  timely  posting  of  payment  and  collection transactions.  The  voucher  balancing  report  is  available,  by  ADSN,  on  SAR  at  SAR4,  mode JFAMAFR.    Also,  the  UH099C0809  provides  a  comparison  of  payments  and  collections processed  through  DJMS  to  monthly  amount  for  budget  program  510  or  530  as  reported through  the  MAFR  system.    This  comparison  provides  an  accounting  for  payments  and collections reported under two independent systems. 76.7.  UH099C0809  Report.  Voucher  Balancing/MAFR  Reconciliation  Report  is  shown  in Figure  76.5  Review  to  determine  the  status  of  payments  and  collections  input  to  DJMS.  The UH099C0809  is  printed  by  accounting  month  (all  vouchers  for  a  month  are  printed  together showing sections I, II, and III).  The voucher balancing report is available, by ADSN, on SAR at SAR4, mode JFAMAFR. 76.7.1.  Section I, Voucher Data, shows all payment and collection input to DJMS.  Each total transaction  (PZ,  C9,  or  PU)  creates  a  line  item  on  the  UH099C0809  and  is  assigned  a positive  value  unless  the  transaction  is  a  cancel  or  correct.    Since  voucher  balancing  is accomplished by clearing account, a voucher could have a total transaction and details for 510 and another line for 530 with a separate total transaction and details.  This information for a total  transaction  is  printed:      voucher  date,  voucher  number,  clearing  account,  voucher amount,  FORMAT-ID,  action  indicator,  update  number  (processed  or  rejected),  and  input ADSN.    The  detail transactions  with  the  same  voucher  date, voucher number, and  clearing account  are  shown  with  the  total  transaction.    The  detail  transactions  are  assigned  an opposite value.  If a voucher has a difference of zero, the voucher is in balance.  A voucher is printed  once  showing  all  detail  transactions  that  caused  the  voucher  to  be  in  balance.    All rejected and recycled transactions are printed below the difference amount with the reject or recycle  code.    The  latest  rejected  and  recycled  transactions  continue  to  be  shown  on  the UH099C0809  until  the  voucher  comes  into  balance.    Out  of  balance  voucher  is  indicated with  *.    Once  a  voucher  comes  into  balance,  the  UH099C0809  continues  to  show  the voucher  as  a  one-line  entry  (the  total  card)  until  DJMS  totals  equal MAFR.  A FORMAT-ID  YX23  transaction  may  appear  as  a  processed  detail  transaction  with  an  input  source  of 3860.  This is a DFAS-DE voucher-balancing unique transaction input by DFAS-DE/ FJF to balance a voucher  for a  payment  made  but  not posted to an  MMPA.  This  detail transaction cannot be posted because there is no longer an MMPA on the DJMS file. 76.7.2.  Section II, Reconciliation of DJMS and MAFR, shows the total reported by clearing account  through  MAFR  compared  to  the  total  (PZ,  C9,  or  PU)  successfully  processed through  DJMS.    The  sum  of  the  successfully  processed  total  records  shown  in  section  I should equal the total processed DJMS shown in section II.  Section II is retained and printed until section I comes into balance.  PZ05,  PZ06,  C905,  C906,  PU65,  and  PZ95  transactions automatically  update  the  DJMS  total  as  shown  in  section  II.    The  MAFR  amount  is  net AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1181  the individual  vouchers  making  up  the  MAFR (payments  less  collections)  of  all  payments  and  collections reported  through  MAFR.   To determine total,  review  the  daily appropriation  summary ledger.   PCN  SH069-J03 (JUMPS/MAFR Reconciliation  List) must be furnished to DFAS-DE/FJF so DFAS-DE/FJ can assist the bases with voucher balancing, if needed. 76.7.3.  Section  III,  Adjustments  to  MAFR,  shows  all  YX05  transactions  input  by  DFAS-JGM/DE  (the  YX05  is  an  adjustment  to  the  MAFR  amount  shown  in  section  II).  DFAS-JGM/DE is the only source of input for the YX05. The YX05 is input based upon supporting documentation  including  OF  1017G,  Journal  Voucher,  SF  1081,  Voucher  and  Schedule  of Withdrawals and Credits, etc., which has been processed through MAFR. 76.7.4.  Section IV, Summary, is broken down into three parts: 76.7.4.1.  Part  I,  Out-of-Balance  Vouchers,  provides  an  aging  of  out-of-balance vouchers.   The aging  is  broken  down  to  show  the  number  of  days  a  voucher  has  been out  of  balance  as  follows:  future,  0-7,  8-15,  16-30,  subtotal,  31-60  days,  over  60 days,  total.    Based  on  the  date  of  the  out-of-balance  vouchers,  all  out-of-balance vouchers would be shown. 76.7.4.2.  Part  II,  Current  Period  in  Balance,  provides  the  FSO  with  a  count  of  the number  of  vouchers  that  came  into  balance  for  the  period  covered  by  the UH099C0809 regardless of the voucher date. 76.7.4.3.  Part III,  MAFR/JUMPS Reconciliation,  provides a recap of  section II  by year and  month  and  clearing  account  as  shown  in  section  II.    The  MAFR  amount,  total voucher  amount,  and  difference  amount  are  included  to  provide  the  reader  a  quick overview. 76.8.  Daily  DJMS/MAFR  Reconciliation.  The  FSO  makes  sure  that  the  appropriation  being cited and reported through MAFR agrees with the appropriation reported and processed through DJMS.  If a discrepancy is discovered before the end of the accounting month, the correction can easily  be  made  regardless  of  the  system  (DJMS  or  MAFR)  being  corrected.    If  the discrepancy  is  discovered  after  the  accounting  month  has  been  closed,  it  becomes  a  more complicated  correction  procedure  (for  corrections  to  MAFR,  see  paragraph  76.12,  and  for corrections to DJMS see below).   After the day's business has been concluded and the vouchers have been processed through MAFR, Accounts Control receives a daily appropriation summary ledger  which  includes  the  day's  activity  for  each  appropriation  or  budget  program  by  voucher number and date.  Since now only 510 and 530 are being reconciled through voucher balancing, Quality  Examination  (QE)  should  ask  Accounts  Control  for  a  copy  of  the  daily  appropriation summary ledger (the 510 and  530  portion  only).   QE  reviews  this  product  and  compares it to  the  total transaction  being  sent to DFAS-DE as  shown  on the DROT.   If any discrepancy is identified, it is corrected in the next update. 76.9.  Reconciling the UH099C0809 Report: 76.9.1.  The products used to reconcile the UH099C0809 are: 76.9.1.1.  Daily Register of Transactions (DROT) 76.9.1.2.  Daily Transaction Record (MP-19-100). 1182 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 76.9.1.3.  SF 1081 76.9.1.4.  JUMPS/MAFR reconciliation list (PCN SH-069-J03). 76.9.2.  Daily  upon  receipt,  the  DAO/FSO  should  review  and  reconcile  the  UH099C0809 for any out-of-balance vouchers.  It is essential that the DAO/FSO account for the cause of the out-of-balance.  The  DAO/FSO  has  to  reconcile  current  month  as  well  as  prior  accounting year  and  month.    In  some  cases,  the  FSO  will  take  no  action  (PQ  posting  as  NQ)  but  the responsibility to reconcile still exists. 76.9.3.  Review section II of the UH099C0809 and determine if each clearing account for the year  and  month  is  in  balance  (DJMS  total  equals  MAFR).    If  section  II  is  in  balance, proceed to section I.  If not, determine the cause of the out-of-balance. 76.9.3.1.  First,  if  the  daily  MAFR  to  DJMS  reconciliation  has  been  made,  the  cause of the out-of-balance should be easily determined. 76.9.3.2.  Any  unprocessed  voucher  (either  unreported  or  rejected  from  base  level) should have been identified and follow-up action taken. 76.9.3.3.  At  month  end,  if  the  daily  MAFR  to  DJMS  reconciliation  has  not  been accomplished, compare  the  vouchers  processed  through  DJMS  as  shown  in  section  I  to the vouchers shown on the monthly JUMPS/RECON list (PCN SH-069-J03). 76.9.3.4.  Reconciling  the  UH099C0809  report  requires  researching  any  differences  in section II. (See 76.9.4 below.) 76.9.4.  Review section I of the UH099C0809 report to identify any out-of balance vouchers.  Examine the different amounts shown below each listed voucher.  If a voucher is in balance, the amount  of difference  will  be zero (FORMAT-ID  PZ  for total and  PC,  PK,  PA, PQ, PM, etc., for detail). 76.9.4.1.  If  the  difference  is  positive,  the  processed  total  exceeds  the  processed  detail. Review the rejects and recycles to determine if any non-posted detail transactions can be accounted for on the UH099C0809 reports. 76.9.4.1.1.  If  the  detail  transaction  cannot  be  located,  review  the  DTR  for  any rejected transaction. 76.9.4.1.2.  If  the  reject  cannot  be  found,  review  the  DROT  to  make  sure  that  the detail transactions were processed. 76.9.4.1.3.  If  transaction  is  rejected  or  not  submitted,  re-input  the  detail  transaction through JDC. 76.9.4.2.  If the difference amount is negative for a payment voucher, the total card is not as  large  as  the  detail  transactions  posting  against  that  voucher.  Review  the  DTR  for rejected total transaction, (total transactions are assigned a SSN of 999999999 for sorting purposes  on  the  DTR).  Next,  review  the  DROT  to  make  sure  that  the  total  card  was transmitted to DFAS-DE. 76.9.4.2.1.  If a total  transaction has not  been  submitted  or  has rejected, re-input the total transaction (processing a PZ06 or C906 to cancel the original PZ03 or C903). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1183  76.9.4.2.2.  If the original PZ03 or C903 had an erroneous voucher number, voucher date, or amount, input a PZ05 or C905 to correct the original input. 76.10.  FA0809D Report, Members with Uncleared NQ and PX Entries.  ( See  Figure 76.6)   This report is  produced twice a  month before the  end of month.  Data  in  this  report  is in  SSN sequence within servicing ADSN.  It shows the current status of recycling PQ transactions (NQ memo entries) and delinquent pay authorizations (PX entries).  PX entries are created when a pay authorization remains open after performing end-of-month restructure, regardless of the length of time  the  authorization  has  been  open  on  the  MMPA.    Clearing  the  PX  or  NQ  entries  requires careful research and analysis.   Review the MMPA, FA0809D report, payment voucher, and any other documents that  may help in  clearing  discrepancies (see Chapter  52  and  Chapter  53  for description  of  NQ,  N7,  NN  memo  entries).    Follow  the  procedures  below.    If  additional guidance is required, contact DFAS-PMJSAB/DE.  This report is found on JFAREG on SAR4. 76.10.1.  PX entry present and: 76.10.1.1.  payment was made but not reported.  Report payment transaction. 76.10.1.2.  payment  was  made  and  reported  with  erroneous  FORMAT-ID  (for  example, payment was reported as PQ and should have been PL).   Cancel payment reported with erroneous  FORMAT-ID and report correct payment.  Exception:  If erroneous FORMAT-ID  was PL  or  PM,  do  not  attempt  to  cancel.  When  a  PL  or  PM  payment  transaction  is received and no PL or PM authorization is present, these transactions recycle and cannot be  canceled.    Report  correct  payment  and  contact  DFAS-PMJSAB/DE  to  delete erroneous payment from recycle. 76.10.1.3.  payment  was  not  made,  member  did  separate,  and  final  separation  has processed (MMPA  fixed  status  is  V).   DFAS-DE  will  settle  member's  account.   Make sure  DFAS-DE  is  informed  immediately  of  any  items  that  may  affect  final  settlement. This completes action necessary by FSO.  Open PX will remain on MMPA and FA0809D report until out of IAS. 76.10.1.4.  payment  was  not  made  and  member  has  not  separated.    Determine  if member  is  due  payment.  If  so,  either  make  payment  and  report  transaction  or  release authorization into  next regular  payment  by  processing  a  PQ26  transaction.   If  member is  not  due  payment,  take  necessary  action  to  have  MMPA  corrected  (contact  MPF, DFAS-DE,  etc.).  Erroneous  entitlements  generated  from  reenlistment  or  separation require DFAS-DE action. 76.10.1.5.  member  has  departed  PCS.    If  payment  was  made  but  not  reported,  report payment transaction.   If  payment  was  not  made,  contact  member's  new  station,  furnish all  available  facts,  and  request  they  clear  delinquent  authorization  by  following  above procedures. 76.10.2.  NQ entry present and: 76.10.2.1.  payment  was  incorrectly reported (possible erroneous  FORMAT-ID,  member did not reenlist or separate, etc.).  Process PQ06 to cancel payment and delete NQ entry, then report correct payment transaction. 76.10.2.2.  payment was correctly reported.  Determine status of reenlistment, extension, or separation transaction. 1184 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 76.10.2.2.1.  If reenlistment, extension, or separation transaction was not input or has rejected to  the  MPF  (NN  entry  on  MMPA  with  output  control  code  of  E),  contact MPF and ensure transaction is input and/or rejects are cleared. transaction  has  recycled 76.10.2.2.2.  If  reenlistment,  extension,  separation (N7  entry  on  MMPA),  or  has  rejected  to  DFAS-DE  (NN  entry  on  MMPA  with output control code of N), action will be taken by DFAS-PMJ/DE. 76.10.2.3.  reenlistment, extension, or separation transaction was canceled. 76.10.2.3.1.  If you have canceled the check that was issued for the PQ authorization, process a PQ06 transaction to  remove NQ  entry.   Report canceled  PQ payment as a PK  transaction,  and  report  check  cancellation  transaction  (C1)  against  the  PK transaction. 76.10.2.3.2.  If the  member  erroneously  received  payment,  process  PQ06 transaction to remove NQ entry and report payment as a PK transaction.  A debt will be  created  for the  overpayment.    Contact  the  member  to  return  money  and  process cash collection (C2) against the debt. 76.11.  DFAS-DE  Processing.  The  processing  logic  of  some  of  the  systems  programs  at DFAS-DE  causes  some  transactions  to  reject  or  post  as  memorandum  entries  at  DFAS-DE.  Memorandum  entries  (except  NQs)  are  not  passed  to  voucher  balancing  and  therefore  are  not shown on the UH099C0809. 76.11.1.  When  a  PQ03  is  reported  to  DFAS-DE  without  an  authorization  on  the  MMPA, the PQ03 posts as an NQ memo entry unless the MMPA is in a V status.  It appears in section 8 of the DTR as a recycle.  It also appears on the UH099C0809 as a recycle with recycle code RCA.  However,  the  PZ03  processes  and  voucher  balancing  receives  the  PZ  without  any posted  detail  transaction.    Thus  an  out-of-balance  voucher  is  created.    When  the authorization  is  generated,  the  open  PQ  authorization  appears  on  the  MMPA.  The  NQ  is released and  closes the  open  PQ.  This automatic  processing of the  PQ  is  shown  in  section IV  of the DTR and as a  processed  transaction on  the  UH099C0809.   If  the MMPA is in V status,  the  PQ  posts as a  PK and  voucher  balancing receives the PK.  (See Chapter  52  and Chapter 53 for separation and reenlistment processing.) 76.11.2.  TLA  payments  are  not  reconciled  in  voucher  balancing  since  these  payments  cite clearing account 515 or 535.  However, these payments do appear on the MMPA as FID 79 or an N6 memo entry. 76.11.3.  If a SSN or name as shown on a payment does not match any record on DJMS, the payment  is  automatically  rejected  to  the  input  source  with  the  exception  of  advance  pay transactions  (PAs)  which  will  recycle  under  certain  circumstances.    Also,  program  logic may prohibit the posting of a payment.  In this case, a DFAS-DE unique payment transaction has  to  be used and the  FSO  can review  section  6  of  the  DTR  for  the  processed  transaction along with an explanation provided in the trailer record identified by FORMAT-ID N9.  This payment posting would also appear on  the UH099C0809 as a processed transaction with an input source of 38XX. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1185  76.11.4.  Clothing  maintenance  allowance, initial (CMAI),  is  shown  on the  MMPA  as  N3 (memo  entry).  Clothing  is  charged  to  budget  projects  516  and  536  and  therefore  is  not considered in voucher balancing. 76.11.5.  Request  DFAS-DE's  assistance  when  processing  a  collection  transaction  outside immediate access storage (IAS).  (See Chapter 2). 76.12.  Adjustment to MAFR (Current FY or Prior FY).  When  an  adjustment  to  MAFR  is required,  use  an  SF  1081,  voucher  and  schedule  of  withdrawals  and  credits,  to  make  the adjustment.    Use  the  SF  1081  even  when  correcting  prior  period  report  data.    The  SF  1081 would  still  be  included  in  applicable  records  as  a  current  month  transaction.    Examples  of problems that require a MAFR adjustment include: 76.12.1.  When a budget program or budget project is erroneously cited in MAFR; 76.12.2.  The voucher contains errors in appropriation and limitation (and subsidiary codes if both are in error); 76.12.3.  A  change  is  required  to  FY  for  annual  appropriation  refunds  to  reimbursements and vice versa. 76.12.4.  To  reconcile  section  II  of  the  UH099C0809,  forward  to  DFAS-ADREM/DE  all copies  of  adjustment  voucher  input  to  MAFR  citing  P510  or  P530,  to  ensure  proper reconciliation. 76.12.5.  Copies  of  a dju stment  voucher s  to  correct  fiscal  year  only  ar e  not required  by  DFAS-ADREM/DE.    In  these  cases,  the  correction  need  only  be  processed through MAFR. 76.13.  Quality Assurance (QA).  The chief of military pay reviews the UH099C0809 monthly to  determine  that  voucher  balancing  is  being  accomplished  currently.    Section  IV,  Part  III, provides the year and month DJMS voucher totals do not equal MAFR totals.  The FSO will be advised of any year and month out-of-balance older than current month, less 3 months. 76.14.  Special  Operating  Procedures.  If  a  base  does  not  have  a  normal  base  processing framework,  local  procedures  will  have  to  be  developed.    However,  the  local  procedures  must provide  for  daily  reconciliation  and  proper  accounting  of  any  out-of-balance  vouchers  as  in section I or out-of-balance older than current month, less 3 months. 1186 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 76.1.

Military  pay  will  occasionally  provide  limited  pay  service  to  members  of other  Services.    The  military  pay  office  has  the  final  approval  authority  over  all  payments made  to  members  of another Service.  When these payments are made, they are reported to the member's main payroll processing site. 77.2.  Substantiating  Documents.  Retain  supporting  documents  which  can  verify  member's name,  SSN  and  branch  of  service  with  a  copy  of  disbursement  voucher.  Retained  copies  to include travel orders, LES and other documents if necessary.   Annotate the member's ID number on the retained copy of the travel order or leave papers. 77.2.1.  AF  Form  265,  AFO  Payment  Authorization,  is  used  to  authorize  payment  to members when the reporting is to be accomplished through JDC. 77.2.2.  AF Form 1209, Document Transmittal, is used to list and mail  documents to  parent Service  central  site.    Prepare  an  original  and  two  copies  numbered  consecutively  using numbering system prescribed in paragraph 77.4  Precede this number with parent Service's abbreviation  (A-Army,  C-Coast  Guard  or  M-Marine  Corps).  Insert  each  support  document (and  attachments)  transmitted  in  document  data  part  of  form  identified  by  form  number, document title, original or copy, and document identification number. 77.2.3.  DD  Form  1351-6,  Multiple  Payments  List,  is  used  to  process  several  payments  of a single type for a single Service. Since type of payment made is noted in block 6 (purpose) on  military pay voucher, do not use  type  block  on  money  list.  Show  Service  disbursed  for in "Acty block". Other blocks on the form are self-explanatory. 77.2.4.  DD  Form  117,  Military  Pay  Voucher,  is  used  to  process  single  payments.    Show member's name, SSN,  etc. in open block on  form and obtain signature of payee in block 19 for single payments. Multiple payments contain this data on the money list; show "Transient Payments"  in  open  block  on  form.    Insert appropriation and  program  designated  by  parent Service for type of payment covered in the appropriation block.  Show total amount covered by this voucher or supporting money lists in the amount block.  Use other blocks of this form as required; blocks are self-explanatory. 77.2.5.  DD Form 139, Pay Adjustment Authorization, is used to charge the pay accounts of members  who  are  either  absentees,  deserters  or  escaped  military  prisoners  for  the  cost  the DAO incurred in providing transportation or meals to the member. 77.2.6.  DD Form 397, Claim Certification and Voucher for Death Gratuity Payment, is used to  authorize  payment  to  designated  beneficiaries  of  deceased  members.    Support  payment with  message  from  service  concerned.    When  authorization  to  pay  is  received  by  phone, obtain  written  confirmation. Immediately after payment, send a paid copy of DD Form 397 to parent service's central site. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1197  77.2.7.  DD  Form  1337,  Authorization/Designation  for  Emergency  Pay  and  Allowances,  is used  to  authorize  emergency  payments  to  dependents.    Dependents  ordered  to  evacuate may  obtain  emergency  payments  by  presenting  original  DD  Form  1337  and  proper identification to any DAO.   Total amount designated in authorization are payable in a lump sum or in installments at option of dependent.  Where maximum amount or final installment is paid, attach form to duplicate voucher and submit to parent Service's central site. 77.2.8.  SF 1034, Public Voucher for Purchases and Services Other Than Personal, is used to authorize  Temporary  Lodging  Allowance  (TLA)  payments  to  members  of  another  Service. Use  statements,  certificates  or  forms  normally  required  by  paying  Service  to  substantiate payments.  Submit duplicate SF 1034 voucher to parent Service's central site. 77.3.  Transient  Payments.  DAOs  may  make  casual  payments  for  pay  and  allowances  to active  duty  members  of  other  Services.    Any  member  in  transit  between  duty  stations, temporary  duty  assignment  or  on  leave  status  may request a casual payment.  Before an active duty  member is  paid, identification, status  and  entitlement  must  be  established,  since  the  FSO will  be  the  authorizing  official.    Payment  documents  should  be  processed  and  transmitted according to the following Service's specific instructions.  For parent Service central site mailing and message addresses, see paragraph 77.5. 77.3.1.  Army: 77.3.1.1.  FSOs  may  make  casual  payments  to  a  soldier  when  the  soldier's  identity, entitlement  and  status  so  warrant.    FSO  should  base  soldier's  entitlement  on  his  or  her current Leave and Earnings  Statement  (DFAS  Form  702).    Use  the  soldier's  ID  card  to establish  the  member's  identity.    You  should  request  certain  documents  to  determine  if a  soldier  is in a  good  duty  status (e.g.,  leave, TDY or PCS in-transit).   For example, a soldier who is on: 77.3.1.1.1.  Authorized  leave  will  have  a  DA  Form  31,  Request  and  Authority  for Leave, covering his or her absence from duty station; 77.3.1.1.2.  TDY  will  have  a  DD  Form  1610,  Request  and  Authorization  for  TDY Travel  of  DoD  Personnel,  covering  his  or  her  authorized  TDY  and  any  authorized leave in conjunction with that TDY; or 77.3.1.1.3.  Leave in conjunction with a PCS will have both a DA Form 31 and orders indicating a PCS from one station to another. 77.3.1.2.  If you believe that the soldier's documents have been altered, his or her actions appear  to  be  suspicious,  or  documentation  is  incomplete,  you  should  call  DFAS-IN  at DSN 699-2800 to verify information.  DFAS-IN  cannot authorize  payment, but they  can furnish  information  which  you  might  use  in  making  the  decision.    Once  payment  is made, you should process the documents according to procedures in paragraph 77.4.1. 77.3.1.3.  FSOs  should  not  make  casual  payments  to  an  Army  Reservist  or  National Guard  member unless  he or  she is on  extended active  duty  (over 60  days).   FSOs  may make  casual  payments  to  soldiers  on  extended  active  duty  when  the  soldier's  identity, entitlement  and  status  so  warrant  (see  paragraph  77.3.1.1  above  for  documentation requirements). 1198 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 77.3.2.  Coast Guard: 77.3.2.1.  Documentation.  Coast  Guard  members  on  active  duty  who  request  a  casual payment must present a military ID card and orders or leave form. In addition members should  have a  copy of their latest Leave and  Earnings  Statement (CG-5209) that  shows monthly entitlements. If there is any question about the amount to pay the member, FSO should  contact  the  Coast  Guard  Pay  and  Personnel  Center  in  Topeka,  Kansas  for assistance  at  commercial  (913)  295-2910.  DD  Form  1351-6  or  DD  Form  117  should be prepared according to the instructions in paragraph 77.2. 77.3.2.2.  Advance  Copies  of  Payments.  Daily,  FSOs  should  mail  two  copies,  labeled "advance copies" of the DD Form 1351-6 or DD Form 117 and substantiating documents to  the  Commanding  Officer  (OGRQ),  US  Coast  Guard  Finance  Center,  1430  A Kristina Way, Chesapeake, VA 23326. 77.3.2.3.  Reporting  Payments.    Weekly,  DAOs  should  mail  all  the  disbursement vouchers  and  substantiating  documents to the  Topeka Service  Center (paragraph  77.5) for processing. 77.3.3.  Marine Corps: 77.3.3.1.  Marine  Corps  personnel  on  active  duty  or  extended  active  duty  (tours  in excess  of  30  days)  who  request  a  casual  payment  must  present  a  military  ID  card  and orders or leave form.  If there is any question about the amount to pay the member, FSO should  contact DFAS-KC (JEA) for  assistance  at  DSN  465-7652  or  commercial  (816) 926-7652.   Cross-disbursing payments should be reported daily to DFAS-KC (EAX) via message  or  telefax  and  should  include  member's  name,  social  security  number,  amount of  payment,  payroll  number  and  date  of  payment  (telefax  number:    DSN  465-5348  or commercial  (816)  926-1372  or  (816)  926-5348.)    Copies  of  the  transmittal  document, disbursement voucher and substantiating documents should be mailed monthly to DFAS-KC (see 77.5). 77.3.3.2.  Partial  payments  to  individual  Marine  Corps  Reservists  assigned  to  active duty  for  a  period  of  12  through  30  days  will  be  provided  only  when  Marine  Corps disbursing  facilities  are  not  available.    Before  making  payment,  the  FSO  must  contact DFAS-Kansas  City  Center  (EAX)  by  message  or  telephone  (DSN  465-5264  or  7636; commercial (816) 926-5264 or 7636) to confirm the pay status of the reservist, to ensure that  partial  payment  has  not  already  been  made,  and  to  be  advised  of  the  amount  of payment  to  make.  Complete  accounting  will  be  shown  on  the  payment  voucher  using the  pay  appropriation  data  cited  in  the  member's  orders.   The  DAO  will endorse  the Marine's  orders  with  the  amount  and  date  of  payment,  payroll  number  (preceded  by MR),  period  of  active  duty  for  which  the  payment  was  made,  check  number  (if applicable),  disbursing  station  serial  number  (DSSN)  and  DAO's  signature.    Payment documents  used  for  payments  to  Marine  Corps  Reservists  identified  in  this  paragraph will  be  submitted  as  indicated  in  paragraph  77.4.1    However,  the  documents  will  be submitted to DFAS-KC. 77.3.4.  Navy: 77.3.4.1.  FSOs  may  make  casual  payments  to  sailors  when  the  sailor's  identity, entitlement  and  status  so  warrant.    FSO  should  base  sailor's  entitlement  on  his  or  her AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1199  current NAVCOMPT Form 2285, Leave and Earnings Statement (LES).  Use the sailor's ID  card  to  establish  the  sailor's  identity.    Request  documents  which  can  be  used  to verify  that  a  sailor  is  in  a  good  duty  status  (e.g.,  leave,  TDY  or  PCS  in-transit.)  For example, a sailor who is on: 77.3.4.1.1.  Authorized Request/Authorization, covering his or her period of absence from duty station; leave  will  have  a  NAVCOMPT  Form  3065,  Leave 77.3.4.1.2.  TDY  will  have  a  NAVCOMPT  Form  2285,  Request  and  Authorization for TDY Travel of Navy Personnel; or 77.3.4.1.3.  Leave  in  conjunction  with  a  PCS  will  have  a  NAVCOMPT  3071, Personnel  Financial  Record,  which  will  show  a  record  of  payments  he  or  she  has received, copies of his or her current LES and official orders indicating leave period during the PCS. 77.3.4.2.  If you believe that the sailor's documents have been altered, his or her actions appear  to  be  suspicious,  or  documentation  is  incomplete  you  should  call  DFAS-CL  at DSN 580-5682 to verify information.  DFAS-CL cannot authorize payment, but they can furnish  information  which  you  might  use  in  making  the  decision.    Once  payment  is made, you should process the documents according to procedures in paragraph 77.4.2. 77.3.4.3.  Payments to transient Navy personnel made at other than their old or new PDS or TAD/ TDY stations will be subject to the following limitations: 77.3.4.3.1.  Payment may not exceed accrued pay and allowances. 77.3.4.3.2.  Payment of advance pay and allowances are not authorized. 77.3.4.3.3.  Advance  travel  payments  will  be  limited  to  actual  transportation  cost  to the next TAD/TDY or permanent duty station. 77.4.  FSO Action: 77.4.1.  Reporting  Payment  Made  to  Other  Than  Air  Force  Members.  Several  payments  of same  type  for  another  service  may  be  accumulated  on  a  money  list  and  attached  to  a summary voucher.  Otherwise make payment on a separate voucher with required supporting document attached. 77.4.1.1.  Weekly,  vouchers  and  supporting  documents  are  to  be  sent  to  Quality Examination (QE)  for  their  verification  with  the  MAFR  report  (Transaction  For-Others Control Ledger) before mailing the AF Form 1209 and vouchers.  QE must initial and date the  AF  Form  1209  to  verify  that  the  money  amounts  on  the  vouchers  agree  with  the MAFR  report  and  that  the  vouchers  have  been  forwarded  to  the  central  site  of  the member's service.  QE mails AF Form 1209 after verification. 77.4.1.2.  If acknowledgment is not received within 30 days (45 days overseas), prepare a copy  of  unacknowledged  transmittal  marked  "--tracer  copy"  and  send  to  appropriate central  site.   Central  site then  notifies  FSO  that transmittal  was received or requests the FSO resubmit transmittal with supporting attachments. 1200 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 77.4.1.3.  After  transmittal  is  acknowledged,  attach  receipt  copy  to  suspense  copy  and file based on Air Force regulations.  If receipt copy is a duplicate AF Form 1209, replace FSO's copy of AF Form 1209 with acknowledgment copy. 77.4.1.4.  Copy  of  voucher  is  to  be  mailed  to  the  applicable  military  service  central  site address. See paragraph 77.5 for addresses. 77.4.2.  Emergency  Payments  to  Members.    Under  extraordinary  conditions  other  service members  stranded  without  funds  can  be  given  an  emergency  payment  not  to  exceed accrued  pay  and  allowances.    Before  payment,  FSO  verifies  member's  pay  and  military status by contacting parent Service central site or organization to which member is to report for  duty.  Hospital  evacuees in  transit  may be paid reasonable emergency  payments  without status verification. 77.4.3.  Payroll  Numbers.    Assign  a  payroll  number  to  each  voucher  beginning  with  "001" until  you  reach  "999"  before  starting  over  with  001.    Precede  this  number  with  parent Service's  abbreviation  (A--Army,  C--Coast  Guard,  N--Navy  and  M--Marine  Corps).    For example,  payment  vouchers  to Marine Corps members would be assigned voucher number M001 and continuing until the payroll number reaches M999 before starting over.  List each number  on  transmittal  document  as  required  in  paragraph  77.2.  NOTE:    These  numbers may vary from those assigned to document transmittal. 77.5.  Special Provisions: 77.5.1.

Grade change transactions are  shown  on the  MMPA as FID MD.   AFPC is the only source of input for these transactions. 78.2.  De  Facto  Promotions  (Officer/Enlisted).  When  a  member  is  promoted  erroneously,  a revocation order  may  state  that  the  member  served  in a  de  facto  status  during the  period  of  the erroneous  promotion.  De  Facto  orders  (for  personnel  reasons)  validate  any  official  acts performed by the member in the erroneous grade.  The FSO will make a determination using the guidelines  below,  as  to  whether  the  member  is  entitled  to  pay  and  allowances  at  the  higher grade  for  this  period  of  time  before  submitting  a  correction request  to  DFAS-DE.    A  member may retain pay and allowances received as the result of an erroneous promotion: 78.2.1.  If  the  member  performed  the  duties  of  that  position  in  good  faith,  and  under  the color  of authority. 78.2.2.  If  the  promotion  was  not  statutorily  prohibited  (for  example,  a  2Lt  may  not  be promoted  to  the  next  higher  grade  until  the  officer  has  completed  18  months  of  service, because of the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA)).  If the determination cannot  be  made  locally  as  to  entitlement  to  pay  and  allowances,  forward  all  appeals  to DFAS-DE.    If  the  appeal  is  denied,  advise  the  member  of  his  or  her  right  to  remission  or waiver per Chapter 69. 78.2.3.  XL03  Management  Notices.    XL03  management  notices  are  sent  whenever  an MD05 processes.  The FSO verifies that all impacted entitlements are properly updated.  1210 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 79 EMERGENCY AND DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURES Section 79A—Emergency Evacuation. 79.1.  Description.  At  times  of  emergency  resulting  from  natural  catastrophe,  war,  and  other disasters,  and  during  deployment  operations,  FSOs  are  often  required  to  make  payments  to members or their dependents.  DFAS-DER 7010-1, provides guidance on designation of support bases to perform accounting and  finance functions during periods of emergency conditions and AFI  10-213  provides  guidance  on  conducting  operations  under  emergency  conditions.  Emergency payroll production and other central site procedures under emergency conditions are contained in a DFAS-DE instruction currently being finalized. 79.2.  Definitions.

Reviews  pay  transaction data in application and  verifies that amounts  shown as paid agree with the MMPA and DTR data.  Determines that amount for which waiver is requested does not exceed 1 month's basic pay.  If amounts shown are incorrect, note on application and return to member's commander for correction. 79.5.4.2.  If appropriate, prepares messages to DFAS-DE/FJPS for their input to suspend recovery  of  not  more  than  1  month's  basic  pay  advanced  as  emergency  evacuation payment as of date application is received from member's commander.  See Chapter 69 for JDC screen. 79.5.4.3.

Endorses  application  to  DFAS-DE  stating  that  amounts  shown  have  been verified with DTR. 79.5.4.5.  If  member is discharged or released  from active  duty  before receipt  of  waiver notification  from  DFASDE,  recover  amount  of  emergency  advance  payments,  to  the fullest  extent  possible,  from  amounts  due  member  on  separation.    This  applies  except when  member  immediately  reenlists.    In  such  cases,  suspend  recovery  action  until DFAS-DE reply is received (see Chapter 53). 1212 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 79.5.5.  Upon receipt of notification from DFAS-DE: 79.5.5.1.  If application for waiver is approved, annotates the suspense copy:  "Waiver of recovery under 37 USC, 1006(c) granted by SAF in amount of $, letter dated." 79.5.5.2.  When  application  for  waiver  is  disapproved,  annotates  the  suspense  copy:  "Waiver  of  recovery  under  37  USC,  1006(c)  disapproved  by  SAF  per  DFAS-DE  letter dated." 79.5.5.3.  Advises  member  of  SAF  action  and  files  copy  of  reply  with  suspense  copy. Input transactions are not required. 79.6.  Special Provisions: 79.6.1.  Waiver of Right of Recovery: 79.6.1.1.  Description.  The Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) may waive recovery of not more than 1 months' basic pay advanced to member's dependents under 37 USC 1006(c). Request submitted by members for waiver under this authority are adjudicated on a case-by-case  basis.  Where  evacuation  and  dislocation  allowances  are  paid  as  a  result  of emergency  evacuation,  waiver  application  must  indicate  that  these  allowances  were insufficient to pay unusual expenses of the sudden evacuation.  This includes reasonable expenses incurred for rental of furniture and an automobile as a result of delayed arrival of these items.  Usually, purchase of these items as a result of evacuation is not regarded as  sufficient  reason  for  waiver  of  the  1  month's  advance  pay,  since  the  individual  has permanent  possession  and  use  of  them.    Unusual  circumstances  where  the  evacuation causes  financial  hardship  should  be  submitted if evidence indicates  that recovery of  full amount advanced is contrary to equity and good conscience under 37 USC 1006(c). 79.6.1.2.  Killed  or  missing  in  action.  When  a  member  is  killed  or  reported  missing  in action  incident  to  the  emergency  condition  which  caused  the  ordered  evacuation  of dependents,  consider  waiver  of  recovery  of  not  more  than  1  month's  basic  pay, advanced as an emergency allowance, without request. 79.6.1.3.  Limitation.  Only 1 month's basic pay, at the rate for the member's pay grade at the time the  emergency  evacuation  payment  was authorized, or the unpaid balance  may be  waived.    Any  amount  withheld  from  the  member's  pay,  for  application  against  the advance of pay, is considered recovered. 79.6.1.4.  Notification  of  Rights.   Member's  servicing  FSO  advises  member  as  soon  as possible  after  such  AFO  makes  payment  or  receives  notification  from  DFAS-DE  that payment  was  made  by  another  FSO.    Application  for  waiver  may  be  initiated  by  the member or the member's commander. 79.6.1.5.  Remission.    Disapproval  of  an  enlisted  member's  request  for  waiver  does  not affect the member's right to apply for remission under the provisions of Chapter 69. 79.6.2.  Application of Waiver of Recovery: 79.6.2.1.  Preparation,  documentation,  and  submission.    Application,  prepared  by member or member's commander, is in letter form and must include: 79.6.2.1.1.  Member's name, grade, and SSN. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1213  79.6.2.1.2.

Identification  of  extraordinary  expenses  connected  with  the  evacuation.  Include amounts spent and periods in which expenses were incurred: 79.6.2.1.8.1.  Education of children. 79.6.2.1.8.2.  Rent or lodging. 79.6.2.1.8.3.  Utilities. 79.6.2.1.8.4.  Food. 79.6.2.1.8.5.  Car (gas, oil). 79.6.2.1.8.6.  Other transportation. 79.6.2.1.8.7.  Laundry and dry cleaning. 79.6.2.1.8.8.

Upon  receipt  of  application  for  waiver  of  right  of  recovery, DFAS-DE: 79.7.1.  evaluates application for waiver and sends to SAF for final action; 79.7.2.  prepares input to delete debt, if waived; 79.7.3.  resumes collection action if not waived; 79.7.4.  notifies member's servicing FSO. Section 79B—Deployment. 79.8.  Deployment  Briefing.  The  servicing  FSO  must  brief  all  members  on  alert  for deployment  duty,  and  all  potential  deployment  personnel,  on  deployment  procedures (commanders of GSUs perform this function for their personnel). 79.8.1.  Advise members that  they  should  have a copy  of their latest LES  with them at the time of the briefing, processing through the FSO, and the period of deployment. 79.8.2.  Inform members that US Treasury checks will not be forwarded to an emergency area but that casual or partial payments may be available. 79.8.3.  Advise  members  to  provide  adequate  support  for  their  dependents  while  on deployment.  Support can be achieved in one of these ways: 79.8.3.1.  Direct deposit  of regular  mid-month and  end-of-month  pay  to a  joint account. Members  should  be  cautioned  about  difficulty  in  cashing  personal  checks  in  foreign countries at other than US Government installations. 79.8.3.2.  Dependent support allotment. 79.8.3.3.  Class  X  allotment  where  time  is  too  short  to  start  normal  dependent  support allotment. 79.9.  Payments Before or During Deployment: 79.9.1.  Advance  Travel.    Members  may  elect  to  receive  advance  per  diem  in  amounts authorized  per  procedures  and  conditions  prescribed  by  major  commands  and  governed by JFTR,  Volume  I, and DFAS-DER 7010-3. 79.9.2.  Advance Pay.  Personnel may be authorized to receive an advance in an amount not to exceed 3  months'  basic  pay  and  allowances,  less  deductions.    Payments  are to  be  made  on request  only,  with  no  blanket  payments  authorized.    When  regular  payment  procedures  do not  meet  immediate  need  of  member,  use  casual,  partial,  and  advance  pay  procedures  as appropriate.    See DoDFMR,  Volume 7A,  chapter  32,  for  conditions  under  which  payments can  be  made and the repayment  requirements  for advances.   Report payments to DFAS-DE as  soon  as  possible.   FSOs  ensure  that  partial  payments  do  not  exceed  net  entitlements  to avoid  quasi-advances  being  established  on  member's  MMPA.    See  Chapter  35  for processing requirements. 79.9.3.

Applies  TDY  procedures  except  all  management  files  are  maintained  by  the servicing FSO.  Only in  extenuating  circumstances, or  when  command  of  host base and command of TDY base mutually agree that it will be advantageous for management files to  be  administered  by  FSO  servicing  the  deployed  unit,  will  files  be  forwarded  (hand-carried by the unit commander) to the TDY station. the  servicing  FSO,  give  any  79.10.1.2.  When  management  files  are  kept  by pay-affecting  documents,  originating  at  TDY  base,  to  the  designated  unit  commander after  the  transaction  is  processed.    The  unit  commander  is  required  to  maintain these  documents  in  a  file.    When  the  deployed  unit  returns  to  home  station,  the  unit commander gives this file to the base FSO for filing of appropriate documents. 79.10.1.3.  For members electing to be paid by TDY FSO: 79.10.1.3.1.  Identifies all members making this election. 79.10.1.3.2.  Processes a start TDY ADSN (LD01) and change paying ADSN (LB04) transaction.  (See Chapter 42.) 79.10.1.3.3.  Processes  an  LD04  and  an  LB04  transaction  when  member  returns from TDY. This action causes payment to revert to the home station. 79.10.2.  TDY FSO: in  allotment  amounts  during  period  of 79.10.2.1.  Makes  necessary  changes deployment.  If a change is warranted because of a change in normal pay or compelling personal reasons, TDY  station prepares DD Form 2558, Authorization to Start,  Stop, or Change an Allotment, and processes the  change.  Provide a  copy  of the allotment  forms to the unit commander.   See Chapter 57 for DD Form 2558 preparation instructions. 79.10.2.2.  Processes  transactions  to  start  and  stop  entitlements  accruing  to  member  at TDY  station.    When  TDY  ADSN  is  established  on  member's  MMPA  (by  an  LD04 transaction  input  by  home  station)  any  later  TDY  FSO  to  which  member  is  diverted processes  an  LD04  transaction  to  change  TDY  ADSN.  See  Attachment  18  for  Format-IDs allowable for processing by TDY FSO. 1216 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 79.1.

To obtain payment of any of the evacuation allowances on this DD Form 1337, present  it,  together  with  proper  identification,  to  any  military  disbursing  officer,  either overseas or in the United States. 3.  Payment of the amount of base pay (if any) authorized in this DD Form 1337 as an advance of pay may be obtained in installments (normally not more than two) or in one lump sum, as you request. The total amount of this base pay cannot exceed the amount designated by your sponsoring member.  The advance of pay is not a gratuity and will be deducted in full from the sponsoring member's pay unless the Secretary of the Service concerned waives recovery of 1 month's portion when the recovery of the full amount would work a hardship, would be against equity and good conscience, or against the public interest.  A sponsor who wishes to request a waiver of recovery of 1 month's basic pay should consult the commanding officer.  If the sponsor does not wish to authorize an advance of basic pay, sponsor inserts NONE in the space provided for the amount - $  _. 4.   If you have been receiving a military allotment of pay, and your evacuation is temporary to a safe haven location, your allotment checks will be forwarded to you at the safe haven area.  If you have been evacuated to a designated place, as specified by your sponsor, at a location in the United States (including Alaska and Hawaii) or a territory or possession of the United States, it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to forward your new address immediately to the office which issues your allotment checks.  This will ensure prompt receipt of future checks. 5.  If DD Form 1337 is lost before the evacuation, you or your sponsor must report the loss, theft, or destruction immediately to the commander or personnel officer, and a new DD Form 1337 will be issued to you. 6.   If you lost the DD Form 1337 during evacuation, report the loss, theft, or destruction to the military disbursing officer from whom you request payment.  Be prepared to state the circumstances of the loss, the amount of advance pay authorized in the DD Form 1337, and the amount of any previous payments you have received of each type.

The BIMAA works for the Chief, MPF, and is the link  with  the  Major  Command  Reserve  Affairs  Office  and  HQ  Air  Reserve  Personnel Center (ARPC).  The  function  of the  BIMAA  is  to  assist  IMAs  with  personnel  matters and actions.   It is recommended the FSO point of contact work closely with the BIMAA 1222 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 and  the  base  level  unit.    The  formation  of  a  working  group  to  initiate  this  program  is strongly encouraged. 80.3.1.3.  The  active  duty  FSOs  report  performance  of  active  duty  tours  (AD)  and inactive  duty training  periods  (IDTs)  for  IMAs  performing  at  or  near  their  bases.   This pay  data  is  reported  via  ECCS  using  the  "Statement  of  Tour  of  Duty"  screen  or  the "IAD performance confirmation" screen. 80.3.2.  Active duty performance reporting: 80.3.2.1.  The AF Form 458, Statement of Tour of Duty, is the primary source document for  pay and  retirement  point  credit.   It  may  be  a  separate  form  or  may  be  included  at the  bottom  of  the  machine-generated  active  duty  order,  AF  Form  938,  Request  and Authorization  for  Active  Duty  Training/Active  Duty  Tour.  This  form  and  supporting documents must be properly completed.  A separate AF Form 458 must be completed for each  active  duty  tour  performed.  The  AF  Form  458  will  continue  to  be  used  with  all manually  produced  orders.    Return  incomplete  or  inaccurate  forms  to  the  training activity specified in block 2 of AF Form 458 or block 19 of AF Form 938. 80.3.2.2.  The  IMA  is  authorized  advance  certification  per  AFMAN  36-8001.    The  AF Form  458  may be  submitted as  early as  the  first  day of duty.  For a  properly authorized advance certification, the following statement must be included in the remarks section:  "I certify that the above member reported for duty at (date and time reported).  I will notify the servicing RPO  by  message if the member does not complete the tour as stated."  The certifying  official  must  send  a  message  within  24  hours  of  the  date  such  duty  is terminated. 80.3.2.3.  Before  entering  into  ECCS,  verify  the  following  for  completeness:  order number,  name,  SSN,  performance  dates  and  times,  as  well  as  arrivals  and  departures, mode  of  travel  and  also  whether  government  quarters  are  used.    There  are  two signatures  required  on  each  AF  Form  458;  the  member's  and  the  certifying  official's.  The  time  and  date  of  reporting  may  be  anytime  within  7  days,  before  or  after,  of  the actual start date stated in the orders; however, the duration of the tour may not exceed the total number of days authorized in the orders. 80.3.3.  Inactive duty performance reporting: 80.3.3.1.  IDTs can be performed for pay or non-pay.  For the purpose of ECCS, process only those  for pay (block 15 of the AF Form 40A, Authorization for Individual Inactive Duty Training).  IDT must be authorized in advance (date in block 8 on or before the first date of duty) by the supervisor using  the  AF  Form  40A,  section  I.   The  AF  Form 40A may  be  reproduced  if  extra  copies  are  needed  for verifying  scheduled  participation  for the  civilian  employer  or  for  reservations  at  billeting;  however,  the  signatures  on  the document must be originals or certified true copies. 80.3.3.2.  IMAs are paid one day's basic pay for each IDT of at least 4 hours duration.  If the IDT is for 8 hours or more, they will receive 2 days' basic pay.  IMAs cannot be paid for more than two periods in any one calendar day (24 hours). AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1223  80.3.3.3.  Authorizing official for the AF Form 40A is: 80.3.3.3.1.  The  commander  or  chief  of  the  activity  to  which  the  member  is assigned  or attached. 80.3.3.3.2.  The unit  commander,  for IMAs attached to a Reserve unit.  NOTE:  This authority may be delegated in writing to a specific military or civilian member of the activity. 80.3.3.4.  The  certification  of  AF  Form  40A  requires  three  signatures;  the  member's, that  of  the  official  who  authorized  the  training,  and  that  of  the  person  supervising  the member  and  certifying  the  training  was  performed  as  authorized.    The  completed AF  Form  40A  serves  two  purposes:    It  documents  training  and  acts  as  a  pay  voucher.  It  must  be  complete  and  accurate  before  duty  can  be  reported  for  payment.  Close attention must be given to the date blocks (6, 8, 18, and 19) on the AF Form 40A. 80.3.3.5.  If  the  forms  are  not  properly  completed,  return  them  to  the  training  unit  or activity that is specified in block 10 of the AF Form 40A. 80.3.4.  ECCS formats are listed in the J Forms File as "Statement of Tour of Duty" and "IAD Performance Confirmation". 80.3.5.  Supporting  documents  must  be  mailed  with  a  transmittal  noting  performance reported via ECCS to the servicing RPO. 1224 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Figure 80.1.

Description.  A  fraudulent  contract  of  enlistment  or  induction  is  not  void  but  is voidable  at  the  option  of  the  government  (DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  chapter  4).    When  the government becomes aware of the  fraud, it may void the  contract  or waive objection and allow the contract to stand.  If an enlistment is initially determined void, the member is separated. 81.2.  Responsibilities.  The MPF maintaining the member's field personnel record is responsible for  submission  of  voidable  enlistment  data  to  DFAS-DE.  Required  input  is  produced  as  a by-product of the personnel system (MILPDS) update. 81.3.  Effect on MMPA: 81.3.1.  Enlistment  Initially  Determined  Void.    Member  is  separated  (see  Chapter  52  for separation procedures). 81.3.2.  Fraudulent  Enlistment  Pending.    All  pay  and  allowances  and  leave  accruals  are suspended pending  either separation  or  waiver of the objections.   Allotments are  stopped at the end of the prior month.  All pay due is suspended (MMPA in T-status, reason 1). 81.3.3.  Voidable  Enlistment  Waived.    If  member's  account  was  suspended,  member  is put  in  an  on-station  status.    If  a  different  status  exists,  submit  input  transactions  per applicable  chapter.  All  pay  and  allowances,  deductions  and  leave  accruals  are  reinstated, back  to  date  of  suspension,  and  any amount in held pay, due to status, is released.  Submit input transactions per Chapter 57 and Chapter 58 to restart any allotments. 81.4.  DFAS-DE Output: 81.4.1.  DTR.    Processed  transactions  appear  in  section  6  of  servicing  ADSN's  DTR (Chapter  2). Note  all  input  actions  (from  DTR)  concerning  void or  voidable  enlistment  in management  case  file.  Enter  date  member's  pay  was  suspended  due  to  fraudulent enlistment and date waiver of fraud was determined, if applicable. 81.4.2.  Pay Authorization: 81.4.2.1.  Fraudulent enlistment pending.  Zero-pay authorization is created. 81.4.2.2.  Voidable  enlistment  waived.    If  member's  account  was  suspended,  DJMS creates a new pay authorization.  1226 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Chapter 82 PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 82.1.  Description.

Description.  Command  responsibility  pay  (CRP)  is  for  officers  serving  in  positions, designated  by  SAF,  of  unusual  responsibility  and  critical  in  nature  to  the  Air  Force.  Officers serving  in  these  designated  positions  must  be  in  pay  grade  0-6  or  below  to  be  entitled  to  this special  pay.  CRP  is  scheduled  for  termination  30  Sep  07  or  when  the  member  is  no  longer entitled, whichever comes first. 84.2.  Responsibility.  The  MPF  or  the  member’s  CSS  is  responsible  for  determination  of entitlement  to  CRP  and  for  processing  of  transactions  needed  to  pay  CRP  to  Commanders. The transactions are input to MILPDS and flow to DJMS-AC, posting to the MMPA as FID 07. 84.2.1.  MILPDS  Input.  Input  generated  by  MILPDS  is  the  only  acceptable  method  to authorize  (start)  or  terminate  (stop)  CRP.  CRP  corrections  and  cancellations  are  also generated  from  MILPDS  input.  These  transactions  (FID  07)  are  created  by  the  MPF  and processed through MILPDS. 84.3.  Case Establishment,  Substantiating Documentation  and Processing Procedures.  The only  two  acceptable  methods  for  initiating  CRP  input  to  DJMS  are  via  MILPDS  or  the  case management  system (CMS).    Accordingly, DFAS  does  not accept e-mail,  telephone  or  walk-in CRP requests. 84.3.1.  MILPDS  Input.    Input  generated  by  MILPDS  is  the  only  acceptable  method  to authorize  (start)  or  terminate  (stop)  CRP.    CRP  corrections  and  cancellations  are  also generated  from  MILPDS  input.  These  transactions  (FID  07)  are  created  by  the  MPF, processed  through  MILPDS,  compiled  on a CRP  spreadsheet and  manually processed each week  by  DFAS.    The  CRP  spreadsheet  serves  as  the  substantiating  document  for  DFAS action.   NOTE:    The  MPF  does  not re-input  a  transaction  if  one has  already  been  created and  MILPDS reflects the  proper information (see paragraph 84.3.2.1 below). 84.3.2.  CMS.    CMS  is  used  for  all  other  CRP  issues.    Cases  are  opened  by  the  customer (FSO, MPF, AFPC, etc.) and sent to the command responsibility pay box.  Established cases must fall into one of the following categories: 84.3.2.1.  After  MILPDS  input, DJMS  still  does  not reflect  the  same data as  MILPDS.  These cases are typically opened by the MPF, but may include the FSO and AFPC. 84.3.2.1.1.  Prior  to  establishing  a  CMS  case,  the  customer  must  wait  10  business days  from  the  date  of  initial  MPF  input  to  allow  completion  of  normal  MILPDS transaction processing (see paragraph 84.3.1 above). 84.3.2.1.2.  There  must  be  a  rejected  MILPDS  transaction  available  for  view within  DJMS-processed  transactions.    NOTE:    the  transaction  will  have  a  reject code of RAK-trans recycled because of temporary suspension of program. 84.3.2.1.3.  The  rejected  transaction  will  serve  as  the  substantiating  document  for DFAS action. 84.3.2.1.4.  DFAS  refers  the  case  to  the  member’s  servicing  MPF  if  an  appropriate MILPDS transaction does not exist (see paragraph 84.3.2.1.2).  The MPF refers the AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1231  case  back  to  DFAS,  advising  DFAS  of  specific  action(s),  if  any,  taken.  If  the  MPF makes  input,  DFAS  will  process  the  transaction(s)  according  to  paragraph  84.3.1 above and close the CMS case. 84.3.2.2.  Current  CRP  entitlement  prevents  processing  of  other  DJMS  transactions.  These  cases  are  typically  opened  by  the  FSO  or  DFAS-PMJCAC,  but  may  include  the MPF and AFPC. 84.3.2.2.1.  Temporary  Changes.    These  are  changes  requested  by  the  customer  to allow additional DJMS  processing.  Temporary  changes cause  no loss of  entitlement and  return  the  member’s  CRP  to  the  same  status  it  was  in  prior  to  the  changes.  (Example:   CRP  erroneously started  prior  to  PCS arrival transaction.)   DFAS  will temporarily  stop  the  CRP,  process  the  affected  transaction,  resume  CRP,  and  close the  CMS  case.    NOTE:    Requests  for  temporary  changes  to  allow  promotion processing are not acceptable.  Promotions must be input and processed in accordance with paragraph 84.3.2.3 below. 84.3.2.2.2.  Permanent  Changes.   Permanent  changes  are  requests  to  terminate  CRP to allow PCS departure and separation processing. 84.3.2.2.2.1.  There  must  be  a  rejected  MILPDS  transaction  available  for  view within DJMS-processed transactions. 84.3.2.2.2.2.  The  rejected  transaction  will  serve  as  the  substantiating  document for DFAS action. 84.3.2.2.2.3.  DFAS  refers  the  case  to  the  servicing  MPF  if  an  appropriate MILPDS transaction does not exist (see paragraph 84.3.2.2.2.1).  The MPF refers the case back to DFAS, advising DFAS of specific action(s), if any, taken.   If the MPF  makes to the paragraph 84.3.1 above and close the CMS case. input,  DFAS  will  process transaction(s)  according 84.3.2.3.  Promotion Transaction Rejects and Recycles.  A CMS case is opened by DFAS for each reject.   DFAS  will  temporarily  stop  the  CRP,  process  the  affected  transaction, resume CRP, and close the CMS case. 84.3.2.4.  Additional Information Required.  A CMS case is opened by DFAS to request information  required  to  complete  processing  of  a  transaction  compiled  within  the  CRP spreadsheet.  Typically, this is the result of duplicate, multiple, or incompatible MILPDS transactions.  DFAS  sends  these  cases  to  the  MPF  for  validation/explanation.  The  MPF refers the case back to DFAS, advising DFAS of specific action, if any, required. 84.4.  Inquiries.  General  CRP  policy follow  normal  policy procedures/protocol  (i.e.  local  FSO/MPF  to  MAJCOM,  and  then  to  AFAFO  (policy)  and/or AFPC).  Issues  should  be  resolved  at  the  lowest  level.  Specific  (individual)  issues/concerns should also  be  directed to the local FSO  or MPF  for  resolution.  Again,  if  the  local  offices  are unable to resolve the issue, normal protocol should be followed. issues/questions should AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1232  84.5.   (DELETED) 84.5.1.

This code indicates whether an entry is open, closed, canceled, or a non-pay  entry.    It  is  essential  you  check  these  codes  when  determining  what  entitlements  a member was due for any period of time. CODE 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 DESCRIPTION Open entry in MMPA. Open MMPA entry suspended for indebtedness. Closed entry that affects pay. Entry used to correct an overpayment in a prior pay period.  Used only when DFAS-DE makes the correction.  (Note 1.) Entry used to correct an underpayment in a prior pay period.  Used only when DFAS-DE makes correction. (Note 1.) MMPA entry used to cancel a prior transaction that results in recoupment of an entitlement that has been paid.  Original computer processing code is changed to 5. Closed MMPA entry which was corrected and does not affect pay.  For audit purposes only. Identifies a period of time that member did not have this MMPA entry in effect due to status. (Notes 2 and 3.) NOTES: 1.  Computer processing control codes 3 and 4 identify a corrective adjustment action. When months of closure is no longer current, these entries are present for audit purposes only.  To determine amount of payment in a prior pay period, consider only entries with computer processing 0, 2, or 9 having dates within the period being computed. 2.  When a member enters a status that does not allow an entitlement to pay, the entitlement is handled as follows.  If status is: a.   Reported, the computer puts a closed entry for each affected entitlement on the MMPA.  This entry is treated as a period of non-entitlement and is subtracted from the entitlement to determine the amount the member is due.  These entries are commonly referred to as 9 entries and contain the following information: (1)  FORMAT ID of the entitlement. (2)  ENTRY-CLSD-DT of the update the report transaction processed.  (3)   CNTRL-CODE 9. (4)  ACTN, computer generated action indicator with last digit of "3" for the status that is being reported. 1278 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 (5)  START, equal to start date of the status.  (6)   STOP, equal to stop date of the status. (7)  MNTLY-RATE or DAILY-RATE the rate at which the period of non-entitlement is computed. b.  START--the computer puts an open 9 entry on the record and suspenses the open entitlement entry by building a closed entry with an Update Cycle Number of 42 (indicating the entry to be restored at the end of the non-pay status). The open 9 entry is the same as the closed 9 entry in paragraph a above except: (1)  No entry closed data code is present. (2)  ACTN, computer generated action indicator with last digit of "1" for the status that is open. (3)  No stop date is present. c.  STOP--the computer closes the 9 entry on the record and restores the entitlement entry by removing the closed entry with an Update Cycle Number of 42.  The closed 9 entry is the same as the closed 9 report entry except: (1)  The ENTRY-CLSD-DT is the update in which the transaction processed and the entry closed. (2)  ACTN, computer generated action indicator with last digit of "2" for the status being stopped. (3)  STOP is the actual date of the discontinuance of the status. 3.  A 9 entry is also used to pay leave rations to enlisted personnel for leave. In this case, a closed 9 entry is put on the record for each leave reported. This entry gives member leave rations and acts as a period of non-entitlement to any open or closed BAS entry.             AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1279  Attachment 11 ENTRY OPEN DATA (EOD)  (ENTRY-OPEN-DT) A11.1.  The  ENTRY-OPEN-DT  is  an  11  position  packed  code  that  was  created  to  identify when  an  MMPA  entry  was  originally  created  or  when  the  latest  change  to  an  MMPA  entry occurred.  All MMPA fixed and variable open entries will contain an EOD. A11.1.1.  The EOD field contains the following data: Position 1-6 Processing Date (YYMMDD). Position 7-8 Update Cycle Number.  In addition to the normal update number, three special JUMPS update indicators were created and are used as follows: 97 - identifies all entries that were converted in Phase 1. 98 - identifies all entries created by month-end restructure (MER). 99 - identifies entries that were created by mass rate. Position 9-10 Processing Month. Position 11 Prior to mid-month flag (1) and after mid-month flag (2).  A11.2.  An example of an EOD is as follows:  a 3501 is input on calendar date 8 March 1989, processing  date  is  9  March  1989,  update  number  03-10,  processing  month  March  1989  (03), and after mid-month cutoff.  The EOD appeared on the MMPA as: 89030910032. A11.3.  For  conversion  purposes  for  Phase  1,  if  the  MMPA  entry  was  in  the  fixed  or  variable open areas, the EOD for the entries converted on the MMPA contain the following: Position 1-6 Processing date of conversion.  Position 7-8 97. Position 9-10 04.  Position 11 1.  1280 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Attachment 12 ENTRY CLOSED DATA (ECD) (ENTRY-CLSD-DT) A12.1.  The  ENTRY-CLSD-DT  is  an  11  position  packed  code  that  was  created  to  identify when  an MMPA  entry  was closed.   All MMPA current  month closed and history entries  will contain  an  EOD  and  ECD.  When an MMPA  entry closes, the  original EOD will be  retained and an ECD will be built based on the date/update/flag the MMPA went into history. A12.1.1.  The ECD fields contain the following data: Position 1-6 Processing Date (YYMMDD). Position 7-8 Update Cycle Number.  In addition to the normal update number, three special DJMS update indicators were created and are used as follows: 97 - identifies all entries that were converted in Phase 1. 98 - identifies all entries created by month-end-restructure (MER). Position 9-10 99 - identifies entries that were created by mass rate.  Processing Month. Position 11 Prior to mid month flag (1) and after mid month flag (2). A12.2.  An example of an ECD is as follows:  a 3502 is input on calendar day 10 April 1989, processing date is 10 April 1989, update number 04-11, processing month April 1989 (04), and after mid month cut- off.  The ECD appeared on the MMPA as: 89041011042. A12.3.  For  conversion  purposes  for  Phase  1,  if  MMPA  entry  was  in  the  history  area,  the ECD  for  the  entries  converted  on  the  MMPA  contained  zeros  and  the  ECD  contained  the following: Position 1-6 Processing date of conversion (YYMMDD).   Position 7-8  Position 9-10 08,  or  the  update  number  that  was  converted from  the  second  position  of  the  closure  process code.    For  example,  MMPA  had  a    closure processed  code  of  BF;  this  was  converted  to 06. The  processing  month  was  converted  from  the first  position  of  the  closure  processed  code.    For example:  MMPA had a closure processed code of KC; this was converted to 11. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1281    Position 11 1. 1282 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Attachment 13 COMPUTER OPEN STATUS ENTRIES, NUMBER OF (CMPTR-OPEN-STAT-ENTRY-NR)  AND  STATUS DETERMINANT CODES (STATS-DETRMNT)  A13.1.  CMPTR-OPEN-STAT-ENTRY-NR.  This  code  is  used  to  identify  the  number  of open  status entries  that are  in the MMPA and to identify a bad condition  of an MMPA.

The  military  pay  of  a  member  who  is  NOT  residing  in  his  or  her  state  of  legal residence  is  not  taxed.  There  are  no  deductions  for  state  income  tax  withholding (SITW) from the member's pay. 2.    The  military  pay  of  a  member  from  CT,  MO,  NY,  NJ,  or  OR,  who  meet  the conditions  of  the  "Three-Prong  Test",  is  not  taxed.    The  member  must  certify  within 30  days  of  his  or  her  PCS  arrival  (New  York  or  New  Jersey  only)  to  prevent deductions of SITW from his or her pay.  Members claiming MO, NJ, NY, or OR need only  complete  the  DD  Form  2058-1,  and  members  claiming  Connecticut  need  to complete the CT-W4 one time, to prevent withholding of SITW. 3.   If  a  member  is  not  residing  in  his  or  her  state  of  legal  residence  and  no  deduction  is currently  being  made  for  SITW  from  the  normal  monthly  pay,  no  SITW  is  deducted from one-time entitlements.  This applies to members outlined in notes 1 and 2. 4.   The Taxpayer Relief  Act of 1997, Public  Law No. 105-34, amended 5 U.S.C. § 5517 to authorized the Department of the Treasury and Puerto Rico to enter into a tax withholding agreement. The agreement  was  executed November 17, 1997, and  is effective January 1, 1998.   Military members who claim the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as their state of legal residence will have taxes withheld as follows: a.   No federal income tax, only state income tax withheld, when duty station is outside the United States (U.S.).  Tax will be computed based on tax rate table.  b.   Federal income tax, with no state income tax, will be withheld when duty station is within the United States.  c.   Members stationed within Puerto Rico will have only state income tax withheld. 5.    Montana  and  West  Virginia  tax  withholding  only  applies  to  guard  and  reserve members.   Active duty member’s pay is not subject to taxation. *6.  The state of North Dakota computes SITW as a percentage of federal income tax withholding (FITW) for regular payroll.  North Dakota uses 14% of FITW for one time withholding (this equates to approximately 3.9%).  Effective 1 January 2006, 1292 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 compensation received for active service as a member of the military (active duty, Reserve, or Guard), including combat zone excluded pay, may be subtracted when computing Arizona adjusted gross income.   Additional information on treatment of military income can be found in Arizona Department of Revenue Publication 704 (www.azdor.gov/brochure/704.pdf). *7.   Members who claim the state of Ohio as their state of legal residence, maintain at least one abode outside the state during the  entire tax year,  maintain  no permanent place  of abode in Ohio  during the  tax  year, and  do not  have  more than 120  contact  periods in the  state  during  the  tax  year  can  claim  exempt  from  SITW.    A  contact  period  is defined  as  an  overnight  trip  away  from  the  member’s  abode  outside  Ohio,  if  the member  spends  at  lease  a  portion  of  two  consecutive  days  in  Ohio  while  away overnight.           In  2007,  New  Mexico  passed  legislation  which  says:    Armed  Forces  Salaries.--A salary paid by the United States to a taxpayer for active duty service in the armed forces of the United States is exempt from state income taxation.     AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1293       ALABAMA State Code:  01 Implementation Date:  1 Jul 1977 Amendment Date:  1 Mar 1992 One-time entitlements are taxed at 3 percent    Step 1.

Purpose.  Action indicator (ACTN-INDCTR) is the data item used to tell the computer programs the  action  to  be  taken  on  a  transaction.    Action  indicators  are  put  in  transactions  by the originator or are computer generated.  The computer generated action indicators are the same as  the  first  six  regular  action  indicators  except  the  first  position  is  alpha.    The  alpha  position identifies  the  event  (PCS,  reenlistment,  promotion,  etc.)  that  processed  to  cause  the  computer to  generate  the  action.   Table  A18.1  shows  the action indicator  name and code, tells  what the action  indicator  does  and  gives  some  general  information about  the  action  indicator.    The  first position of the computer generated action indicator and the transaction that processed to generate that alpha character are shown and explained in the NOTE following Table A18.1. A18.2.  This  attachment  covers  usual  uses,  general  information,  and  notable  exceptions.  It  is very  important  that  you  check  the  FORMAT-ID  involved  to  see  what  special  rules  and/or processing may  be involved. 1400 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Table A18.1.  JUMPS Action Indicators. ACTION INDICATOR       CODE FUNCTION PURPOSE 01 Start 02 Stop 03 Report Record open entries in the MMPA to pay entitlements, collect deductions, pay allotments, held pay, and put information in the MMPA such as TDY ADSN. Close open entries in the MMPA. Processing puts a stop date in the entry and moves it to history. Rules for report transactions vary according to FORMAT ID (refer to manual for details). Generally however, there must be a transaction  for the same FORMAT ID for any period covered by the report transaction.                GENERAL INFORMATION a.  Start transactions for most FORMAT IDs will process as long as there is no open entry for that FORMAT ID on the MMPA, or a closed entry that the transaction start date overlaps.  There are some notable exceptions:  allotments, indebtedness, and FSA can have multiple open entries with the same FORMAT ID. b.  Entries started by a start transaction remain open until a transaction is received to stop, change, correct or cancel the open entry. a.  A stop transaction can normally process only against open entries in the MMPA with start dates equal to or less than the stop date. b.  The stop date is the date through which the entry is effective, except for monthly-rated items stopped on the last day of February.  These pay for a 30-day month. a.  Report events like PCS, accessions, separations, etc., that are effective on a special date.  Processing results in a complete MMPA update of all affected entries, and can result in both starting and stopping of a number of entries, depending on the event. b.  Report inclusive dates of entitlements or status events such as leave or AWOL.  Processing results in a closed history entry and, in the case of status events, a number of closed non-entitlement entries. c.  Report actions such as payments, collections, and information such as voucher totals.  These transactions result only in data being entered in the system.  In the case of payments or collections, adjust the amounts due to the member. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1401  ACTION INDICATOR       CODE FUNCTION PURPOSE 04 Change Change data in open MMPA entries. Processing results in a closed entry with the old data and a new open entry with the new data. Processing updates monetary amounts as necessary.       GENERAL INFORMATION a.  The start date in a change transaction is the date the new MMPA entry is effective.  The old open entry is stopped the day before the date in the change transaction. b.  For a change transaction to process, there must be an entry on the MMPA with a start date less than the effective date in the transaction. 1402 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 ACTION INDICATOR       CODE FUNCTION PURPOSE 05 Correct Correct erroneous data that is in an MMPA entry. Normally processing puts the entry with incorrect data in history with a processing control code of 6 and creates a new entry with the correct data.  A notable exception is correction of PCS entries.  This processing changes the data in the open or closed PCS entry but does not create an entry with the old data. Correcting one event normally results in correction of all MMPA entries affected by the event.  Where all entries are not correct, the transaction is rejected to DFAS for manual actions.                GENERAL INFORMATION a.  Correct transactions usually have more restriction and specific instructions concerning their use than other transactions.  It is very important that you check the chapter covering the FORMAT ID carefully, especially the figures showing the transaction input formats and special instructions. b.  In general, for correct transactions to process, an entry must be in the MMPA with dates that match the prior date fields of the transaction. c. The transaction, as corrected, must pass the same edits as if it had been submitted correctly, whether it was a start, stop, or report transaction. d.  The correction process can become quite complicated when previously processed transactions have resulted in stop and start transactions, and a date the action was incorrect.  In these cases, transactions must be input in a sequence that does not cause them to reject because they conflict with entries in the MMPA. Example:  The start date of an open entry and stop date of a closed entry are incorrect. (1)  If the correct date is later (940610 instead of 940510 for the start date, and the stop date the day before), process a transaction to correct the start date of the open entry and then a transaction to correct the stop date of the closed entry. (2) If, in the case above the correct date had been earlier (940410 instead of 940510), the stop date of the closed entry would have been corrected first. Then the start date of the open entry. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1403  ACTION INDICATOR CODE      FUNCTION        PURPOSE GENERAL INFORMATION e.  Where there are several open and closed entries that are involved in the correction, extra care is required.  If in doubt of the sequence, use a printout of the MMPA as a worksheet and consider what the MMPA would look like after each transaction processes. In many instances, a cancel transaction must match the entry on the MMPA in order to process.  In other instances, only dates must match.  See the figure in the manual for the input format and special instructions. This action indicator can only be used to increase the amount of an allotment. 06 Cancel 07 Increase Completely voids the effects of a transaction that should never have been processed. A cancel transaction restores the MMPA to the condition prior to the erroneous transaction.  The canceled transaction is shown in history with a computer processing control code of 6. Increase the amount to be paid to an allottee. Processing puts a stop date in the open entry and moves it to history.  A new entry is opened with the increased amount. 08 Decrease  Same as increase except only reduces the amount of an allotment. 1404 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 ACTION INDICATOR          CODE FUNCTION PURPOSE GENERAL INFORMATION 09 Inquiry 10 Reply 11 Pay 13 Release 18 Suspend Request information from member's MMPA. This action indicator cannot cause a change to any entry in the MMPA.  Return information from an inquiry to the inquirer. This action indicator is used in pay authorizations that are computed and sent to the FSO. This action indicator is used to release pay held in the HA and HG entry, and under some conditions HD entry, to member, and from the HF to the source listed in the E713 transactions. Used when a member requests a waiver or applies for a remission of a debt. Notify the FSO of amount to be paid to a member by the FSO. To release pay and allowances withheld from payment to a member. Processing of this transaction reduces the pay-held-balance and establishes a held pay release entry in the MMPA. Temporarily suspends collection. Processing puts a code in the open indebtedness entry which causes the computer not to collect from the member's pay for the indebtedness. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1405  ACTION INDICATOR          CODE FUNCTION PURPOSE GENERAL INFORMATION 20 Resume 21 Remit 26 Delete 40 Memo Restarts collection of indebtedness from a member's pay after collection action was suspended. Processing resumes collection at the rate in the transaction. Forgive all or part of a debt balance by waiving, remitting, or declaring debt uncollectable. Processing closes open entry and moves it to history with the reason for forgiving the debt. Notify DFAS that a one-time pay authorization is not being paid. Processing causes the money to be placed in the member's pay authorization. Memo entries are used to explain actions of events that have impact on the MMPA. Used when the request for a remission or a waiver has been disapproved. Used when the request for a remission or a waiver has been approved. When this action indicator is used, the FSO must assure that any other transaction relating to the one-time pay authorization is processed on a timely basis so member will not be over or under paid. Used only by DFAS. 1406 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 ACTION INDICATOR          CODE FUNCTION PURPOSE GENERAL INFORMATION 46 Delete 61 63 Pay Authorization EEP Submission Report Deletes an entry or entries from the variable or history areas of the MMPA. It cannot be used in the fixed area of the MMPA. Tells the FSO what the final pay authorization is when a member is being separated. Report mid and end-of-month voucher totals to DFAS for exception payment posting. Used only by DFAS See paragraph 52-15. Used with FORMAT ID "PU" only. 65 EPP Correction  Correct mid and Used with FORMAT ID "PU" only. 83 Report 86 Cancel end-of-month voucher totals reported to DFAS. Post past periods of entitlement that are outside IAS. Puts a closed report entry on the MMPA. Cancel an MMPA report entry put on the MMPA by an "83" action indicator. Use is restricted to DFAS-DE. Use is restricted to DFAS. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1407  ACTION INDICATOR CODE 93           FUNCTION PURPOSE GENERAL INFORMATION Used with FORMAT ID "PZ" only. Report regular mid and end-of-month voucher totals under 100% detail submission of regular payrolls or to clear an out-of-balance "PU" transaction.  NOTES: .If first position of MMPA action indicators is an alpha character, it refers to the FORMAT ID for status  (i.e.,  SA=A,  SB=B,  SJ=J,  ST=T,  etc.),  except  for  C=TC, D=MD, E=EA,  V=E3/E4/E5/E6, and Z=MASS rate changes.        Bases can use a "3" in the first position of the action indicator with the first six action indicators.  This indicates that member just entered the service and causes the transaction to recycle up to 60 days waiting for an accession transaction to process and create an MMPA  1408 AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 Attachment 19 FORMAT IDENTIFICATION (FORMAT ID) A19.1.  FORMAT  ID  is  the  data  item  used  to  identify  the  type  of  transaction,  management notice, entry or pay authorization in DJMS. A19.2.

It is generated to notify the losing and gaining accounting and disbursing station numbers (ADSN) of the projected date departed last duty station (DDLDS) and arrival dates.  The XI management notice is for information only, with no action required. There are four separate notices:  1. XI03 is generated and sent to the ADSN as a notice of a member’s projected arrival.  2.  XI05.  The XI05 is generated if the gaining ADSN was changed from the original departure transaction.  An XI05 is sent to the old gaining ADSN and an XI03 to the new gaining ADSN.  3.  XI06.  The XI06 is generated and sent to the losing ADSN 7 days before the projected DDLDS.  This notifies the FSO that the PCS transaction will process.  4. X150 is generated and sent to the losing ADSN if the member's status is such that it will cause the PCS departure transaction to reject if not cleared before the projected DDLDS.  MGT NOTICE XJ Notice to restart allotments and debts that were stopped by separation/AWOL transaction.  Generated to servicing ADSN when transaction to cancel projected separation is processed or a member is reported AWOL. XK03 Notice of expired ETS. XK04 Notice of recycling or unposted PQ payment.  An XK04 notice is generated on the 25th and 42nd day after receipt of PQ03 payment trans-action if a separation, reenlistment, or extension transaction has not processed and updated the MMPA. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1497 WHAT GENERATES ACTION REQUIRED XJ02 requires no action by servicing ADSN. XJ03 requires the servicing ADSN to contact the member and restarts allotments and debts that were stopped by the separation transaction. Requires action by both the FSO and MPF. Normally the MPF's must input either an E5, if member separated, or an E6, if member extended or reenlisted.  FSO's must either ensure continuation of pay or suppress member depending on circumstances. The XK04 notice is generated to the FSO or MPF unless the transaction rejected to DFAS-DE.  The PQ03 transaction will also reject MIR at this point.  Proper clearing of XK04 notice requires an FSO and MPF combined effort.  MPF action is to ensure reenlistment and separation transaction was input and that the rejected transactions are corrected and reinput.  FSO determines validity of payment.  Payment format may be erroneous or payment was received after a non-monetary reenlistment or extension transaction has updated the MMPA. 1498 MGT NOTICE XK05 XK06 XK07 XK08 XL XM XO XS AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 WHAT GENERATES ACTION REQUIRED Notice of a suspended (Q18 or Q8) DV entry on the MMPA with advance pay type S.

It is Generated to the FSO when a PCS, BAQ, OHA, or VHA transaction (excluding mass rates) is processed.                       NOTE:  Management notices XK05, 06, 07, and 08 will apply to Army, Navy, and Air Force. An XL03 management notice is sent to the FSO, whenever an MD05 is processed. Generated when LD04 is submitted by gaining TDY ADSN which changes TDY ADSN in MMPA. ETS minus 120 days. DOS minus 10 days or advance notice of separation indebtedness.  (See Chapter 52.) FSO must verify entitlements affected by the correction of grade/effective date of grade. Advises that the temporary duty (TDY) ADSN has been established. MPF validates date of separation (DOS), estimated term of service (ETS), number (NR) of extensions. Advise member of projected indebtedness.     AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1499  MGT NOTICE XT XU XW WHAT GENERATES ACTION REQUIRED XT03 is generated by the B2 input preparation subsystem for every transmission received an FSO or MPF. Program from C191NPRP creates the management notice to inform the FSO or MPF that a particular transmission was received.  It describes the processing date and DJMS update in addition to the transmission number.  NOTE:  Applies to Army and Air Force only. An XU03 management notice is required to inform the FSO or MPF when a particular transmission has already been received (duplicate) or is missing.  It is generated by the B2 input preparation subsystem. Program C191NPRP creates this management notice after receipt of notice after receipt of one valid transmission after a missing transmission.  It is created to alert the FSO or MPF that we did not receive a particular transmission based on transmission number logged previously.  NOTE:  Applies to Army and Air Force only. An XW management notice is generated when a PCS transaction is received for a member going from officer training school, and the member has not been promoted to 01 or demoted to E4 or below.  The PCS transaction also recycles RAP (to allow pending separation to process). No action is required by the FSO or MPF.  It is furnished for information only. The intent of the management notice is to assure the FSO or MPF that we received and placed their transmission into the DJMS update indicated in the management notice. Action is required by the MPF to verify that they did or did not submit the missing transmission.  If they had, they must retransmit. If for some reason they had not sent the transmission number in question and not intend to do so, they must submit an XU50 transaction to clear the missing transmission numbers. The XW management notice is sent to MPF to notify them that a separation reentry, or demotion input is required.  If member's normal grade is higher and member is eliminated from officer training school, the FSO notifies DFAS-DE by message to manually process the PCS transaction. 1500 MGT NOTICE XY AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 WHAT GENERATES ACTION REQUIRED XZ Generated to the field each time a DJMS transaction rejects to the operating directorate for their action. Has the following three distinct purposes:  1. Notifies the finance office that an entitlement or status change was received causing member's pay to go below zero, and DQ or DW debt was established for the negative amount.  2. Notifies the finance office that an entitlement(s) change with a prior month effective date was processed that resulted in a net, negative adjustment to the entitlement(s), and a DQ debt was established for the negative amount.  3. Notifies the finance office when the member's net pay is increased by at least $100, and there are debts currently being collected.  Does not apply to advance pay repayments.  FSO can change the scheduled repay rate.         FSO must review the DQ debt to determine which of the following action should be taken:  1.  Immediately collect the debt because it is a routine adjustment.  2.  Notify the member to determine if a remission or waiver action is desired.  If so, the FSO must change the suspension reason to preclude DJMS from automatically collecting the debt on the first calendar day of the second processing month following the processing month in which the DQ debt was established.  FSO can change repayment schedule. These notices are used by base-level FSOs to identify the actual reject code for corresponding ZBD error codes on the DTR. These notices are provided as information only but are widely used to research pay inquiries. AFMAN65-116V1  1 APRIL 2007 1501 WHAT GENERATES ACTION REQUIRED BAQ updated, overseas housing allowance Update OHA.  MGT NOTICE X103 X104 X4 X7 (OHA) present BAQ updated, HOUSING updated. Generated when an excess cost household goods (HHG) Form 139 is delinquent in action to input a debt collection start. Generated when LD02 is processed by TDY ADSN.  It is generated to advise SVC ADSN that TDY has stopped. Verify entitlement, correct inconsistencies between BAQ and HOUSING, if necessary. Traffic management office (TMO) follows up to determine the rebuttal status.  If more time is needed, TMO notifies DFAS-DE. SVC ADSN submits transaction to start entitlements that stopped as a result of TDY. The X8 management notice is sent to the servicing ADSN to determine entitlement to BAQ during period of excess leave. The X9 management notice is sent to the servicing ADSN.  Upon receipt, the servicing ADSN reviews the member's PCS status and decides if BAQ should be adjusted for the period of PCS.  If adjustment is necessary, the servicing ADSN will adjust; otherwise, no action is required. Reverify and correct IDP, CZTE, HFP, and HFP CZ leave balance. Notify DFAS-DE/FJ if BS arr/dep HFP dates or HFP leave carryover balance need corrected. X803 Generated when member (grade E4, 4 years or less service) enters an excess leave status. X9 PCS arrival transaction stops BAQ for members E4 over 4 years and above without dependents and generates an X9 management notice. The notice is generated so a review will be made of the made of the member's BAQ status while PCS. X905 PCS proc-verify and correct 23, FL and/or BS entries.

Stop  all  allotments  effective  the  month  that  the  convening  authority  of  the court-martial ordered the sentence executed when a total forfeiture is ordered. A25.4.  Weekly Records Review A25.4.1.  Review the member's pay record as to status, payments, leave, time not accounted for, and note any discrepancies on a weekly basis. A25.5.  Helpful Hints A25.5.1.  Do  not  wait  for  the  MPF  to  process  the  SJ  transaction.    Adjust  all  the  affected entitlements and stop central pay upon receipt of the AF Form 2098 from the squadron. A25.5.2.  If  the  member  has  been  transferred  from  another  base  or  confinement  facility, contact the prior FSO to verify payments and the adjustments made to entitlements. A25.5.3.  Ensure  the  servicing  MPF  has  input  the  correct  grade  reduction.   Verify  this  date with the court martial order. A25.5.4.  Courts  Martial  orders  must  be  sent  to  the  FSO  with  an  AF  Form  1373, Military Pay Order-Document Transmittal. A25.5.5.  The minimum release date is important to the FSO because an AF Form 2098 will be pre- pared on that date by MPF and sent to the FSO. A25.5.6.  The maximum release date is the date that the court-martial confinement sentence has been completed. A25.5.7.  The manual references for Partial and Single rate BAQ adjustments are DODFMR, Volume 7A, chapters 25 through 31, paragraph 260204 and table 26-3, rule 26, respectively. A25.5.8.  BAQ  is  not  payable  to  a  member  without  dependents  for  any  period  of excess  leave  (non-pay  status).    Reference  DODFMR,  Volume  7A,  part  3,  table  26-3,  rule 10.    For  members  with  dependents  on  excess  leave,  see  DoDFMR,  Volume  7A,  paragraph 260501C. A25.5.9.  If  a  partial  forfeiture  is  ordered,  allotments  may  continue  through  the  month prior  to  the  appellate  review  leave  start  date.    Do  not  start  new  allotments  for  members  in confinement. A25.5.10.  When  computing  pay  due  the  member,  subtract  all  existing  allotments,  FITW, FICA,  SITW,  AFRH,  SGLI,  MGIB  and  debts  that  are  known  to  the  FSO.  Look  for  SRB, RRB, and ESB (R6 and R7) MMPA entries. A25.5.10.1.  VHA is not payable to a member in confinement. A25.5.10.2.  BAS is not payable to an enlisted member in confinement, but is payable to officers in confinement. A25.5.10.3.  Family  Separation  Allowance  may  be  payable.
