Welcome to the 1102 Contracting career field!  No other set of individuals cares more about an 1102’s development than the collective contracting senior leaders and career field team—comprised of the Air Force Contracting Functional Manager, senior civilian and military contracting leaders, the Contracting Development Team, the Air Force Career Field Manager, the staff at the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Contracting) Assistant Secretary (Acquisition) (SAF/AQC), the Contracting Career Field Management Team at Air Force Personnel Center, commanders, directors, and supervisors—and all are committed to each 1102’s development from initial entry into the career field to either retirement or separation.  Uniting the contracting career field’s deliberate development of its 1102s with each 1102’s successful demonstration of the competencies and tasks outlined in this plan will ensure Air Force Contracting continues its proud tradition of growing a technically proficient contracting workforce.  2. What does it mean to be an 1102?    2.1. The 1102 job series is an exciting, challenging, and rewarding career field.  An 1102’s technical development is unique compared to other Air Force specialties.  In order to guarantee the proficiency of contracting personnel charged with ensuring the integrity of the acquisition process, 1102 personnel develop specific technical skills through a combination of training, APDP certifications, and years of on-the-job experience.  1102s gain experience through a myriad of developmental opportunities, including operational, systems, research and development, logistics/sustainment, specialized contracting positions, career broadening, developmental education, contingency operations, and other developmental opportunities.    2.2. 1102s work closely with the units they support to determine how to best satisfy each unit’s requirements, while complying with the governing laws, regulations, and policy.  Relationship building between contracting organizations and customers is critical to developing a well-defined, thoughtful requirements package and acquisition strategy.   As business advisors, 1102s should look for opportunities to both teach and train customers early and often.  Teaching in this context refers to the responsibility 1102s have to advise customers where and how their funds have been spent in the past, whereas training involves educating customers on how their support is vital to finding a solution to find a fiscally responsible solution to meet Air Force requirements.  Contracting involvement during the planning cycle is critical; engaging early in the acquisition process can help avoid rework and create significant savings in the long run.  2.3. The 1102 career field is dynamic, as such 1102s must continue to stay abreast of regulatory changes, policy updates, and command directives, and one way to do that is through meeting mandatory continuous learning requirements.  Devoting daily time to learning and staying alert to changes in the profession is crucial to developing critical thinking and other professional skills.  4  2.4. Above all, 1102s should become familiar with and embrace our career field’s guiding principles (figure 1).   As contracting professionals, 1102s should embody integrity, fairness, innovation, mentoring, and excellence in all they do—all in support of our Nation and profession.    Figure 1.  Air Force Contracting Guiding Principles.   3.  CFETP Goals and Structure.  The goals of the CFETP are to:   •  Outline the education and training available to 1102s. •  Communicate the career development opportunities available to 1102s. •  Provide occupational tasks and competencies that enable 1102s and their supervisors to jointly build a personalized career path to success.   3.1. The CFETP consists of two parts which supervisors may use to plan, manage, and control training within the occupational series.   3.1.1.   Part I is subdivided into four sections and provides information necessary for overall management of the occupational series:  •  Section A explains how individuals at all levels may utilize the plan.  •  Section B identifies career progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field paths. •  Section C associates each development level with occupational series qualifications (knowledge, education, training, experience and other requirements).  5  3.1.2.   Part II is also subdivided into four sections and provides information on 1102 training:  •  Section A identifies Course Training Standards, training objectives, available in-residence or correspondence courses, and Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) proficiency levels. •  Section B identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine the resources available to support training. •  Section C identifies available support materials which may be utilized to assist with 1102 training.  4. Guidance on revisions and feedback.  The AFCFM will conduct an annual review process of this CFETP to ensure its contents remain relevant for effective 1102 development.  When future editions are released, this section will provide guidance on how to integrate the new CFETP with older versions and define which task lists supervisors should utilize for their personnel.  Feedback on potential improvements to the CFETP should be routed to SAF/AQCX at the  USAF Pentagon SAF-AQ Mailbox SAF-AQCX Workflow account.   6  ABBREVIATIONS AND TERMS EXPLAINED  ACAT.

Purpose.  The CFETP provides information for commanders, directors (i.e., COCOs), training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, conduct, and evaluate an effective career field training program in accordance with the DoD Contracting Competency Model.  The CFETP has several purposes:  • Identify requirements for each APDP level and recommend training for each phase of an 1102’s career. •  Provide references to training courses, training materials, and other useful career resources. •  Convey career development opportunities which 1102s and supervisors may use to help shape an 1102’s contracting career.  2. Uses.  This plan is a guide that may be used by unit commanders and directors (i.e., COCOs), unit training managers, supervisors, trainers, and 1102s.  Paragraph 4 below explains the responsibilities of individuals involved in the development of 1102s.  3. Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM at SAF/AQCX is the approval authority for changes to the CFETP.  4. Responsibilities.  The following training responsibilities are assigned to each Air Force organizational level in accordance with the CFETP and AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.   4.1. SAF/AQC.  SAF/AQC will monitor the progress of contracting APDP training course development and eliminate roadblocks preventing timely course development.  SAF/AQCX is the office of coordinating responsibility for the establishment of training policy to support the entire contracting career field.    4.2. AFCFM.  The AFCFM will conduct an annual review of the CFETP and approve any changes to the CFETP.  Recommended changes to the CFETP should be forwarded to the AFCFM in accordance with Part I, Preface, paragraph 5.  4.3. Implementation.  Several stakeholders play important roles in implementing this CFETP.  4.3.1.  Commanders/Directors.  Squadron commanders or directors (i.e., COCOs) should:  •  Recommend 1102s accomplish formal and unit follow-on training, as specified in this CFETP, commensurate with the 1102’s experience and contracting knowledge. •  Create an organization-specific MTL from Attachment 1 of the CFETP and add any contracting tasks/competencies not already included that would help prepare an 1102 for success in their organization.  COCOs may further delegate the creation of a civilian MTL to the branch or section levels. •  Collaborate with their DBO or deputy director, supervisors, Unit Training Manager (UTM), PKX Resource Managers, trainers, and other SMEs to create their MTL.  All  15  tasks identified as “core” in Attachment 1 of the CFETP should be included in the organization’s 1102 MTL.  Units are also responsible for utilizing the Proficiency Code Key to populate column 4 (proficiency levels associated with tasks) of the MTL.  Those proficiency codes annotated with an asterisk in column 4 have been taught at MRC-102 (Mission Ready Contracting Officer course) to the proficiency level indicated; therefore, supervisors may exercise discretion when training and documenting those tasks if the 1102 attended MRC-102, or MRC-102 equivalent courses. •  Establish a local training program that provides 1102s training commensurate with experience levels and workload types.   •  Notify AFICA OL/MAJCOM staffs of formal training shortfalls to ensure timely correction and redirection of formal training emphasis.  4.3.2.  PKX Resource Managers/Unit Training Managers (UTM).  PKX Resource Managers/UTMs implement and manage training programs, policies, and procedures as directed by higher headquarters, commanders, directors, and base training offices.  •  Have a working knowledge of the CFETP. •  Educate personnel on how to use the CFETP. •  Ensure personnel attend required training to achieve the requirements of the position to which they are assigned. •  Assist  commanders/directors  (i.e.,  COCOs)  with  the  development  of  an  organization-specific MTL and ensure each person has an individual training plan (ITP). •  Be cognizant of each 1102’s progress in accordance with their ITP.  4.3.3.  Supervisors.  Supervisors should:  •  Have a working knowledge of the CFETP. •  Educate subordinates on how to use the CFETP. •  Ensure subordinates attend required training to achieve the requirements of the position to which the subordinate is assigned. • •  Assist  commanders/directors  (i.e.,  COCOs)  with  the  development  of  an  organization-specific MTL and ensure each subordinate has an individual training plan (ITP). Incorporate  in  1102  ITPs,  any  specific  position  description  requirements,  or  elective tasks/requirements  which  are  agreed  upon  between  the  supervisor  and  individual  in training.   •  Document an 1102’s demonstration of proficiency in organization-specific tasks on the •  Maintain  a  Supervisor’s  Employee  Work  Folder  (also  known  as  the  “971  folder”)  for each 1102 and include a section for training records. •  Provide individual training records (from the training records section of the Supervisor’s Employee Work Folder) to 1102s prior to the 1102’s reassignment (for transfer to their new supervisor). •  Review the CFETP and ITP with each subordinate within 30 days of assignment and bi-annually  (at  a  minimum)  to  coincide  with  the  normal  feedback  cycle  to  ensure  that ITP.  16  career-long  training  and  education  remains  a  focus.    The  review  should  plot  a  path  to demonstrate proficiency on all tasks related to the 1102’s current position.    4.3.4.  Trainers.  Trainers will plan, conduct, and document training.  They are selected based upon their experience and ability to provide instruction to 1102s.  A supervisor may also serve as a trainer.  Trainers should utilize the AF Contracting Central “Learning Center,” “Knowledge Center,” “Pricing Center of Excellence,” and webinars for training materials, templates, and other resources highlighted in Part II, Section C of the CFETP.  4.3.5.  1102s.  Each employee should take ownership of their career development and have a working knowledge of the CFETP, their organization’s MTL, and other training plans and opportunities.  While the contents of the CFETP are not required, 1102s must complete APDP and CL training requirements associated with their position’s requirements.   17  SECTION B – CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION   1. Occupational Series Description.  The 1102 contracting career field includes positions that perform, supervise, manage or develop policies and procedures for professional work involving  the procurement of supplies, services, construction, or research and development using sealed bidding or negotiation procedures, the evaluation of contract price proposals, and the  administration, termination, and close out of contracts.  The work requires knowledge of the legislation, regulations, and methods used in federal government contracting, as well as knowledge of business and industry practices, sources of supply, cost factors, and requirements characteristics.  To enhance career options and progression in this career field, 1102s should experience a diversity of contracting assignments before applying for staff level and senior leader positions.  1.1. Duties and Responsibilities.  While most duties and responsibilities are position-specific 1102s are generally concerned with:  1) soliciting, evaluating, negotiating, and awarding contracts with commercial organizations, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and State, local or foreign governments for products, services, construction or research and development for the Federal Government; 2) administering contracts by ensuring compliance terms and conditions, including resolution of problems concerning the obligations of the parties; 3) responding to protests, equitable adjustments, and claims; 4) terminating contracts by analyzing, negotiating, and settling claims and proposals; 5) analyzing and evaluating cost or price proposals and accounting system data; 6) planning, establishing, or reviewing contracts, programs, policies, or procedures; 7) formulating and administering policies and procedures to promote achievement of Federal socioeconomic goals, such as those affecting small business, labor surplus areas, and disadvantaged business firms; 8) developing acquisition strategies and directing or managing procurements; 9) providing staff advisory services in one or more of the specializations in the 1102 series; 10) contracting for emergency/contingency support; and 11) closing out contracts in a timely manner.  1.2. Elements of Career Field Progression.  There are several broad contracting mission areas that 1102s support within the Air Force including operational/installation, systems, sustainment, research and development, test and evaluation, classified, specialized, and contingency.  Each mission area plays a key role in the success of the overall Air Force mission and experience in multiple mission areas helps expand the breath of an 1102’s knowledge, skills, and abilities.  While serving in these mission areas 1102s may also seek exciting developmental opportunities such as supervisory responsibilities, career broadening, and staff assignments.    2. Types of Contracting (i.e., Contracting Mission Areas).    2.1. Operational Contracting.  Operational contracting provides timely, effective, and efficient cradle-to-grave contract support to meet the needs of installation commanders, deployed commanders, and resident, tenant, and supported units.  Operational contracting units may be designated as a squadron (CONS), flight (CONF), division (PZI), or another organizational entity designed to meet local needs.  Subordinate elements of an operational contracting unit may be contracting flights, contracting branches, or other organizational components determined locally.  An operational contracting assignment should provide an 1102 with opportunities to  18  experience the full spectrum of contracting from pre-solicitation to closeout as well as the three main contracting areas of commodities, services, and construction.  2.2. Systems Contracting.  Systems contracting includes the acquisition, development, and maintenance (sustainment) of existing and future weapon systems, space and missile systems, etc.  Throughout a systems assignment, an 1102 should seek to learn the complexities of the job, such as the role of contracting in the overall acquisition environment, acquisition strategy, appropriate contract types, political influences, contract pricing, contract negotiations, source selections, multi-functional team participation, and much more.  Subsets of systems contracting include systems acquisition and sustainment contracting.  2.2.1.  Systems Acquisition.  Efforts span five “enterprises”:   aircraft; armament; command and control; business and enterprise systems; and space acquisitions are carried out at AFLCMC directorates located at Wright-Patterson, Eglin, Maxwell AFB Gunter Annex, and Hanscom AFBs, and SMC at Los Angeles AFB, respectively.  The bulk of contract activity at these centers includes major source selections, complex engineering change proposals and major modifications and upgrades to existing systems.  This contract activity is accomplished through the award of new contracts, modifications, and orders placed against existing contracts.  Other unique opportunities within systems acquisition include foreign military sales and joint systems procurements.  Systems acquisition is primarily an AFMC responsibility, except for SMC which is aligned to AFSPC.  2.2.2.  Sustainment Contracting.  Provides worldwide support of fielded U.S. Air Force, FMS, and joint systems, to include spare parts, repair, and maintenance and modification of systems, equipment, and software.  This work is accomplished primarily by the Air Force Sustainment Center’s three Air Force logistics complexes at Hill, Robins, and Tinker AFBs.  Contracting professionals in this environment typically work in Integrated Product Teams (IPT) focused around commodity groups (e.g., landing gear) or product directorates (e.g., C-17 aircraft).  The primary focus of this activity is readiness and supportability.  Contracting systems are intricately integrated with a host of logistics and supply systems.  Sustainment contracting is primarily an AFMC responsibility.  2.3. Research and Development (R&D) Contracting.  Provides advanced study and development effort to identify and enhance technologies having military application.  The labs work in concert with program offices, universities, and other agencies to identify and advance high potential opportunities.  The focus of the labs is exploration and advancement of the state of the art in promising technologies.  Lab contracting is uniquely a responsibility of AFRL, a subcomponent of AFMC.   2.4. Test & Evaluation Contracting.  Provides full range of support to Air Force ranges and installations.  The test centers work with laboratories, product centers, sustainment centers, and operational commands to support developmental and operational test of new and modified systems and emergent technologies.  The focus of these centers is to evaluate performance capabilities and operational suitability of systems and equipment.  Test & Evaluation contracting focuses on supporting the test customer and ensuring that test facilities and equipment meets the needs of the customer.  Test activities often support joint, FMS, and commercial customers.  Test  19  installations fall under the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB, and include Arnold Engineering Development Center and the Air Force Flight Test Center, both AFMC activities.  2.5. Classified Contracting.  1102s in classified contracting positions provide support to highly classified programs and activities.  Specialized security clearances are required to work in this environment, limiting the speed and flexibility of assigning 1102s to these organizations.  The focus of these organizations is support to their unique customer base.  These organizations are typically co-located with other contracting operations and may include some joint activities.  As an alternative to a specific classified contracting position, 1102s may also be able to gain classified contracting experience at some operational contracting units that have classified billets which support both classified and non-classified units.    2.6. Specialized Contracting.  Several Air Force units and activities provide specialized contracting services geared towards supporting the Air Force in a centralized manner or in a very complex manner.  Due to their specific focus, these organizations may provide a great opportunity to gain experience in larger acquisition processes in a shorter amount of time.  As such they provide unique leadership opportunities.  Specialized units are focused on strategic support of specific systems or commodities for the Air Force, such as architect and engineering services, construction, and information technology systems or services.  The mission focus of each activity is unique to the customers of these organizations.  Examples of specialized contracting units include, but are not limited to:  771st Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH; 772 ESS and 773 ESS at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA)-Lackland, TX; 764 Specialized CONS (SCONS) at Kaiserslautern, Germany; 763 SCONS at Scott AFB, IL; 766 SCONS at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI; and 338 SCONS at JBSA-Randolph, TX.  Specialized contracting experience may also be gained through working on individual specialized contracts or within specialized flights.  3. Skill and Career Progression Information.  Contracting is a complex and dynamic career field where critical thinking and continuous learning are essential.  Career progression can vary substantially among 1102s due to a variety of factors including personal goals, types of contracting experiences, geographic mobility, and continuing education.  The following is a guideline for career progression—not every aspect will apply to every member.  Broadly, career progression should proceed through three developmental levels:  tactical (figure 2); operational (not to be confused with operational contracting as discussed previously in this document) (figures 3-4); and strategic (figure 5).  Each level’s figure is displayed in a distinct color (tactical in blue, operational in maroon, and strategic in green) that matches the development levels highlighted in the career pyramid (figure 6).  Each 1102, their mentor(s), and their supervisor should regularly discuss the levels of development displayed in the sight pictures as a means to identify short and long-term career development goals and opportunities.  A “sight picture” is meant to provide a complete view of the developmental elements (i.e., competencies, training, experience, and education) 1102s should seek to attain at a particular point in their careers.  The occupational competencies listed in each sight picture may be developed through education, training, experience, and mentoring.  Aligning individual development goals with the recommended developmental elements in each sight picture should improve the professional competency of the 1102 workforce.  Every 1102 should seek, and every supervisor should strive to provide, quality and timely training as part of achieving the Air Force mission.  Training is not  20  just for new entrants; all members of the contracting career field should embrace continuing education throughout their careers.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will provide tools to assist 1102s in receiving valuable training and experience at appropriate points in their careers.  After reading this section, 1102s should be familiar with the following items for each developmental level of an 1102’s career:  desired occupational competencies; APDP certification levels; developmental education opportunities; career development opportunities (i.e., positions); and miscellaneous topics such as contracting warrants and mentoring.    3.1. Tactical Level (e.g., GS-05 to 12, or equivalent).  Initial contracting assignments should establish and build depth of knowledge and technical expertise within the career field.  A unique element of the tactical level is that the workforce possesses a wide range of occupational knowledge and experience.  As such, this level of development is subdivided into entry and journeymen levels.  Though the knowledge and experience levels of 1102s in this level of development may differ, tactical level 1102 positions share a common set of occupational competencies/capabilities required of their positions as non-supervisory contracting officers, buyers, and administrators, and will progress through a spectrum of training, certification, experiential opportunities, and continuing education.  1102s at this level of development should seek mentors with whom they can build professional relationships that foster communication concerning careers, competencies, behavior, and development.  The tactical sight picture in figure 2 provides a combined illustration of the competency, training, certification, experience, and education elements that 1102s should seek at the tactical level of development.  3.1.1.  Entry Level.  Commanders, directors, and/or supervisors should encourage 1102s to gain experience and should work to involve new 1102s in the entire mission of the organization.  Entry level training tasks are focused on gaining knowledge and beginning to demonstrate competency in a host of contracting areas.  In addition to participating in education and training courses, 1102s should try to develop their knowledge, skills, and abilities through appropriate on-the-job experience and robust self-study.  This foundational knowledge will provide the bedrock for the remainder of an 1102’s contracting career.    3.1.1.1.  All Copper Caps and Presidential Management Fellows are considered entry level contracting personnel and are required to be on training/development plans.    3.1.1.2.   Pathways Interns and all other individuals on targeted developmental positions are highly encouraged to be on training/developmental plans.  Units/supervisors should ensure they are compliant with MAJCOM and organizational policies.   3.1.2.  Journeymen.  After gaining basic competencies, skill, and confidence during their initial time in contracting, an 1102 will continue to gain experience to broaden and deepen their understanding of the contracting career field.  Training tasks during this portion of the tactical level of development are focused on attaining deeper levels of knowledge and demonstrating proficiency in a wide range of contracting areas.  1102s will gain a general understanding of team and institutional leadership and develop firsthand experience in contracting by working on various procurement tasks.   21  3.1.3.   GS-12s (or equivalent) are at the peak of tactical level development and are often relied upon as technical experts, assigned leadership, and training responsibilities.  In the transition between tactical level and operational level development 1102s should consider the benefits of career broadening, Key Career Positions (KCPs), and seeking positions in mission areas with which they have no prior experience.    Figure 2.  Tactical Sight Picture For Buyers and Non-Supervisory Contracting Officers.    3.1.3.  APDP Certification.  The Defense AT&L Workforce Education, Training and Career Development Program, which implements the objectives of DAWIA across the DoD components, mandates certification requirements for contracting positions.  The APDP certification process reflects the education, training, and duty experience gained by the contracting professional through a formal program.  During the tactical level of a career, an 1102 should work to achieve APDP Level I and II (contracting) certifications.    3.1.3.1.  All DoD personnel filling acquisition positions have 24 months to achieve the certification standards assigned to the position.  For example, a new promotee who is APDP Level I certified may fill a position that requires an APDP Level II certification, and that individual will then be required to achieve APDP Level II certification within 24 months after assignment into the position.  See Part II, Section C for resources and links related to APDP certification levels.   22  3.1.3.2.  Commanders and Supervisors are responsible for designating acquisition positions in the Air Force manpower and personnel databases.  Positions receive acquisition coding, and are considered part of the APDP, if the duties are predominantly acquisition functions as defined by Department of Defense Directive (DoDD) 5000.1, Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) 5000.2, DoDD 5000.52 and Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-101/20-101.  APDP coding is based on the responsibilities of the position, and what education, training, and experience is required to perform the job successfully.  APDP coding is not based on the background or preferences of the individual assigned.  3.2. Operational Level (e.g., GS-13 to 14, or equivalent).  1102s should continue to gain additional depth of experience and knowledge in the contracting career field by considering CDE programs, career broadening opportunities, and by seeking positions in mission areas with which they have no prior experience.  3.2.1.  The operational level is characterized by an increase in responsibility and authority through leadership opportunities.  In this level, 1102s may also gain an understanding of the broader Air Force perspective and the integration of people and their diverse capabilities through staff positions at HQ Air Force, HQ AFMC, HQ SMC, and HQ AFICA.  1102s at this level in their career will generally transition from being technical specialists to subject matter experts, leads and/or supervisors that shape efficient and effective business decisions and work cohesively with multi-functional teams to create synergistic results.  1102s at this level should devote time to coaching and mentoring less experienced members of the contracting profession, particularly those in the tactical level of development.  Training and experience at this level prepares contracting professionals for APDP Level III (contracting) certification.  (Note:  In accordance with Director of Acquisition Career Management (SAF/AQH) position grade and certification level guidance, GS-13 and higher grades typically require an APDP Level III certification.  APDP Level III is granted after completion of mandatory training, education, and experience requirements.  See Part II, Section C for resources and links related to APDP certification levels.)  3.2.2.  Headquarters Staff.  An assignment on above-the-wing and center-level staff typically provides a more strategic view of Air Force Contracting, rich experiences to develop and enhance critical thinking skills, and a variety of unique challenges.  Staff 1102s will be asked to develop courses of action and recommendations for AF Contracting’s senior leaders.  Staff opportunities may be available with Combatant Commands, HQ Air Force (SAF/AQC), HQ AFMC, AFICA and other organizations.   3.2.3.  Director of Business Operations (DBO).  An 1102 serving as a DBO acts as the squadron/organization’s senior civilian contracting official and staff advisor, and provides continuity in management and advisory services in support of the commercial contracting function and obligations for the installation.  The DBO acts on behalf of the commander/director in non-military matters with responsibility for the efficient management and technical direction of the squadron or organization.  The DBO may also serve as the Competition Advocate, Business and Contract Clearance Authority, and/or the Small Business Specialist for the squadron/organization or installation.   23  3.2.4.   Key Career Positions (KCPs).  KCPs are broadly defined as specific, career field-identified, GS-13 to GS-15 (or equivalent) positions, which are a subset of career field centrally managed positions that are used to develop critical AF leadership competencies.  Contracting KCPs have been identified as positions that are development in nature and provide critical experience that prepares an individual for advancement to a position of greater leadership responsibility.  The primary focus is to provide current mid-/senior level AF employees with specific knowledge, skills, and abilities identified as crucial in developing employees for higher levels of functional and/or organizational responsibility.  KCPs are the stepping stones for individuals to move from functional experts to corporate assets.    3.2.5.  The Operational sight pictures in figures 3 and 4 illustrate variations of desired competencies for staff or supervisory positions and also identify the training, certification, experience, and education 1102s should strive to achieve through DAU courses, career broadening, various assignments, CDE, and formal education (i.e., graduate degrees).  Figure 3.  Operational Sight Picture For Supervisors.       24  Figure 4.  Operational Sight Picture For HQ Staff Members.    3.3. Strategic Level (e.g., GS-15 to SES, or equivalent).  3.3.1.  The strategic level features positions that carry broad and significant responsibility and authority.  At the strategic level, 1102s will combine highly developed functional and enduring competencies and apply broad professional leadership capabilities.  As a senior 1102 achieves a high position and/or grade at the strategic level, they should develop and integrate a deep understanding of Air Force missions and how tactics, techniques, procedures, technology, and people achieve synergistic results and desired effects, as well as how the mission operates with interagency and multilateral relationships.  At the senior leadership level, 1102s will focus on leading and directing exceptionally complex and multi-tiered contracting and acquisition operations.    3.3.2.  The strategic level continues to challenge 1102s to gain breadth of experience and knowledge through senior level seminars and development programs to gain senior level joint, inter-government, business, and international perspectives.  Senior leaders at this level should also spend time coaching and mentoring members of the contracting profession, particularly those in the operational level of development.  The Strategic sight picture in figure 5 identifies the competencies/capabilities required of successful Air Force Contracting senior leaders and portrays the training, certifications, experience, and education opportunities available to support the growth of senior leaders at the strategic level of development.   25  Figure 5.  Strategic Sight Picture For Contracting Senior Leaders.    3.4. Miscellaneous Topics.  3.4.1.  Breadth of Experience.  Experiencing a wide variety of contracting assignments is an important part of gaining depth and breadth of contracting knowledge and capabilities.  Often, this diversity of experience can be gained at a single installation to the extent that the 1102 actively pursues varied experiences, assignments in different flights/sections or offices, and contractual arrangements or mission areas that they have not yet mastered.  3.4.2.  Geographic Mobility.  For those 1102s willing and able to be geographically mobile there may be even more opportunities to achieve breadth and depth in career experiences.  Effective civilian force development depends upon filling high-level positions with highly qualified 1102s who have a variety of work experiences.  When applying for an 1102 position, this depth and breadth of experience may be the factor that makes an 1102 the best qualified for selection.  This often becomes increasingly true as 1102s reach the strategic level of development.    3.4.3.  Career Broadening.  The contracting career broadening program is an integral part of the Air Force’s leadership development framework.  It is designed to build functional and institutional competencies while enhancing leadership perspective.  Career broadening assignments, although of relatively short duration (36 months), are sufficiently complex and demanding to increase and broaden experience.  Career broadening assignments are designed to  26  enhance an 1102’s breadth of experience and diversity of thought.  The key in determining which career broadening assignment to pursue is to consider which opportunity will enhance the 1102’s strategic skills and perspective.    3.4.4.  Contracting Officer (CO) Warrants.  An 1102 should strive to learn and develop their skills and should consider applying for a position that requires a CO warrant.  Depending on organizational needs, warrants may range from lower dollar thresholds (i.e., limited warrants) to an unlimited dollar threshold.  The quantity and dollar thresholds of warrants within an organization will vary based on organizational needs.  The process of earning a CO warrant requires self-motivation, study, practice, and experience.  An 1102 should study the FAR and its supplements to enhance his/her technical knowledge and likelihood of passing the CO warrant test.  Successful completion of the CO warrant test is required to earn a contracting officer appointment above the simplified acquisition threshold.  Upon passing the CO warrant test, he/she may be required meet a warrant board, depending on the value of the warrant being pursued.  The board is generally made up of a group of senior contracting and acquisition officials.  The warranting process is rigorous for a reason—a CO has a professional responsibility to the taxpayers to make smart, ethical decisions, complete with business acumen and critical thinking to support the warfighter.  If all CO positions are encumbered, 1102s should collaborate with their supervisors to determine how they can best position themselves to be ready to compete for CO positions if/when they come available.  See Part II, Section C for a link to the Air Force mandatory procedure for selection, appointment, and termination of appointment of contracting officers.  3.4.5.  Civilian Developmental Education (CDE) Programs.    3.4.5.1.  Development programs, including the new employee orientation, resident and nonresident professional military education, leadership training, experiential focused learning and higher level strategic leadership programs are learning opportunities available to selected personnel to enhance their professional growth.  Individuals are chosen for these programs through a formal nomination and selection process which begins with self-nomination and a recommendation from their management chain.  Individuals should discuss their interest in CDE programs with their supervisor to understand how these programs could enhance their professional growth.  Previous job performance, accomplishments, and leadership potential are typically factored into each nomination and selection.  CDE includes learning the history and strategic business of the Air Force.  Eligibility for each CDE level is based upon an 1102’s grade:   • Basic Developmental Education (BDE)—GS-07 to 13, or equivalent (varies by program). • Primary Developmental Education (PDE) —GS-09 to 12, or equivalent. • Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE) —GS-12 to 13, or equivalent. • Senior Development Education (SDE) —GS-14 to 15, or equivalent.  3.4.5.2.  1102s may compete to attend CDE in-residence and, if selected, should continue to provide their best work while there.  After 1102s graduate from CDE they should expect to apply their learning and experiences to their jobs before applying for another CDE program.  See Part  27  II, Section C of this CFETP for additional resources related to CDE scheduling and available programs.  3.4.6.  Professional Associations.  Participating in professional associations can also provide specific learning opportunities.  Affiliation with a professional association, especially one that focuses on contracting or acquisition, may support and further an 1102’s professional growth.  These associations can provide networking opportunities for 1102s to engage with industry and Government professionals about regulatory environment changes, best practices, and smart business decisions.  Professional associations related to the contracting career series may include, but are not limited to National Contract Management Association (NCMA), National Property Management Association (NPMA), and Institute for Supply Management (ISM).  See Part II, Section C for additional professional association resources.  3.4.7.  Mentoring.  1102s at all levels should make it a priority to seek advice from more experienced Air Force leaders.  The Air Force Contracting community is proud of its guiding principle of “Caring for one another by sharing knowledge and experiences.”  Air Force Contracting leaders, as well as other more senior personnel in various functional areas, have rich insights that have been developed and learned through years of experience, and they are often excited to coach and mentor other professionals.  When seeking this opportunity, 1102s should have questions prepared, have a vision/plan for the next 5-10 years (CDE, career broadening, separation, retirement, etc.), and have a biography and resume ready.  Prior to meeting a mentor or coach, 1102s should contemplate how they may be viewed by the mentor (i.e., consider the perspective of others when evaluating personal performance) and anticipate the types of questions the mentor may ask, such as career aspirations, work values, unique knowledge, skills, or abilities, and preferred types of work and learning.  4. Career Path.  There is not one single, optimal career path that ensures career success.  Generally, a successful career path includes steady growth in job responsibility and professional development with a broad variety of experience.  Periodically, 1102s should review their personal situation and their organization’s needs in order to reassess their career path goals.  1102s may consider personal strengths, weaknesses, training or experience gaps, commitment to the organization’s mission, and short and long term goals.  Organizationally, 1102s may consider their organization's needs, training resources, position availability, and promotion opportunities.  How well an 1102 performs in his/her current position is the most important factor in determining future success.  4.1. 1102 Career Development.  Development goes far beyond mastering contracting competencies and achieving technical expertise.  In order to advance, an 1102 must also be a leader and effectively manage the people—military and civilian—which are the driving force of our contracting capability.  The structure of the Air Force’s civilian contracting workforce forms a pyramid which rises from a broad base of junior 1102s.    4.2. The Air Force Civilian Contracting Career Pyramid (Figure 6) mirrors the three level development structure previously mentioned in Part I, Section B—tactical (blue), operational (maroon), and strategic (green) levels of development.  Within each development level the career pyramid recommends assignment opportunities from GS-05 (or equivalent) to the Senior  28  Executive Service.  Progression through these three levels allows 1102s to obtain depth and breadth of experience that will be useful when leading at the highest levels of Air Force Contracting.  Figure 6.  Air Force Civilian Contracting Career Pyramid.      29  SECTION C – RESOURCE / TRAINING CONSTRAINTS  1. Centrally Funded DAU Training Authorizations.  These authorizations are governed by SAF/AQH policy memo, “Prioritization of Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Training.”  See Part II, Section C for a link to the policy memorandum and other resources associated with overcoming resource or training constraints.  2. Tuition Assistance (TA).  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 1705, the DoD Acquisition Workforce Development Fund (DAWDF) was established to provide funds for the recruitment, training, and retention of DoD acquisition personnel.  Eligible civilians may use the DAWDF to pay for education and training courses, to include TA.  Funding does not cover acquisition certification courses/programs (i.e., DAU and PME courses).  All Air Force Contracting acquisition coded civilian employees (0301, 1101, 1102, 1103, 1105, and 1199), regardless of pay grade, may request TA through the CCFMT.  2.1. Eligibility.  DAWDF funds may be used by all civilians if they are assigned to an acquisition-coded position under APDP, are either certified to the level required for the position or are within the allowable grace period, and are current with CL requirements.  Tuition assistance is not available for 1102s on term or temporary positions.  2.2. Funding Management and Limitations.  TA funds are centrally managed by SAF/AQH-ATO and funding is limited to two courses per term, with a maximum per person lifetime limit of $50,000.00.  Funding is also limited to courses required to complete Acquisition Career Field Team (CFT) approved education plans to meet the priorities listed in the SAF/AQH and Contracting Career Field TA guides.  TA will not be provided for courses which are an education level equal to or lower than a degree already attained.  Funding may be provided for up to 100% of the cost for tuition, laboratory, and other instructional fees.  Funding does not cover course material, optional fees, parking, charges for personal services or the costs of student TDY or vicinity travel.  TA is not guaranteed until the individual’s request is approved.  The individual assumes all financial responsibility should TA be denied.  See Part II, Section C for more information on the requesting and use of TA from the DAWDF.     30  PART II SECTION A – COURSE TRAINING STANDARD (CTS)  1. Purpose.  1102s in training may demonstrate the desired learning outcomes contained in this CTS.  The desired learning outcomes are provided in Attachment 1.  2. Documentation of Training (Attachment 1).  For 1102s using the CFETP as part of a training program, supervisors or commander-approved trainers are responsible for documenting an 1102’s training in the 1102’s individual development plan (which is derived from the unit/organization’s MTL or, if delegated, branch/section MTL).  Supervisors should ensure that 1102 ITPs also incorporate any specific position description requirements.  The 1102’s supervisor is responsible for maintaining their subordinates’ training records and reviewing those training records during feedback sessions.    2.1. Column 1.  Task, Knowledge, and Technical References.  This column lists the tasks and knowledge recommended for 1102s to become proficient in the contracting profession.  It also provides Technical References (TR) for each task and knowledge area.  2.2. Column 2.  Core Tasks.  This column identifies with an “X” those tasks and knowledge from Column 1 that are considered core tasks to the contracting career field.  2.3. Column 3.  Documentation of Training.  This column is used by supervisors and commander approved unit trainers to record proficient demonstration of tasks and knowledge identified by the MTL.  2.4. Column 4.  Proficiency Codes.  This column indicates the proficiency level that should be demonstrated by the 1102 in training in order for the supervisor or commander-approved trainer to document completion of the task or knowledge area.  Units (or branches/sections, if delegated by the COCO) are responsible for placing proficiency codes in column 4 at the time of unit/contracting office MTL creation.  The proficiency codes annotated with an asterisk in column 4 are part of the MRC-102 curriculum and have been taught to the proficiency level indicated; therefore, supervisors may take that into account when training and documenting those tasks for 1102s who have attended MRC-102, or MRC-102 equivalent courses.  See Attachment 1 for definitions and examples of proficiency codes.  3. Qualitative Training.  Attachment 1 contains the qualitative tasks, knowledge, and competencies recommended for 1102s.  Commanders/directors will create unit specific MTLs, using Attachment 1 as a template and tailoring it as appropriate, to ensure 1102s learn and comprehend the tasks and competencies recommended for contracting professionals in the AF and DoD environments.  At a minimum, unit/contracting office MTLs should include all core tasks indicated in column 2 of the qualitative requirements list.  Units/offices should tailor their MTLs to match the unique tasks/competencies recommended for the 1102’s current position.  For example, operational contracting units may focus on simplified acquisition procedures, base construction, base operating services, aircraft maintenance, and other contracting actions that can be taught through on-the-job training.  Additionally, units/offices will utilize the "Proficiency  31  Code Key", included and defined in Attachment 1 to this document, to populate column 4 of unit specific MTLs.  4. Training Approaches.  Training methodologies will vary based on trainer and the employee’s strengths, weaknesses, interests, learning preferences, experience levels, and other factors.  The trainer should collaborate with the 1102 in training to determine how to blend the 1102’s preferences to ensure the purpose of the training – the 1102’s learning – is properly accomplished.  Trainers are encouraged to see Part II, Section C for training materials related to contracting, career development, leadership, and other topics.  4.1. Trainers should consider:  •  Goals of the training session (i.e., new skills, new techniques for old skills, knowledge). •  Experience level, preferred learning modes, and demographic of audience. •  Budget constraints. •  Time available or allocated for training. •  Resources/materials available (i.e., space, training materials).  4.2. Training methodologies may include, but are not limited to:  •  On-the-job (hands on) training with extensive supervisor and peer feedback. •  Classroom or instructor led training (supported by personal experiences). • Interactive sessions that include quizzes, small group discussions, case studies, question and answer sessions, role playing scenarios, and/or demonstrations. •  Computer based training such as DAU’s online scenario based “games.” •  Videoconferencing such as Defense Connect Online (DCO) sessions and webinars.  5. APDP Designator Table.  The following table provides contracting specific position grade and certification level guidance.    Grade Intern Copper Cap GS-05 to 09 (and equivalent)  Level I GS-11 to 12 (and equivalent)  Level II Level III GS-13 and above (and equivalent) Typical APDP Level Required   Level Description  No certification level required *  Basic or Entry Level Basic or Entry Level Level I / Level II Basic or Entry Level Intermediate Level Advanced Level  * Interns may be coded as level I or II if they are a non-temporary full-time employee, hold a bachelor's degree and are GS-7s or above.  Intern positions which do not meet these criteria should be coded “9” (i.e., no APDP level required) in Defense Civilian Personnel Data System (DCPDS).   32  SECTION B – TRAINING COURSE INDEX   1. Purpose.  This section of the CFETP identifies additional training courses available for the career field.    2. DAU Courses.  DAU provides a full range of basic, intermediate, advanced, certification and assignment specific courses to support the position requirements, career goals and professional development of the AT&L Workforce.  In addition, DAU offers a wide range of continuous learning modules online to meet currency needs of the acquisition professional.  Once an 1102 masters contracting core tasks and competencies, they may work with their supervisors to consider the value and availability of taking classes in other acquisition functional areas.  Broadening an 1102’s understanding of other acquisition functional areas and how those functional areas integrate with contracting’s processes may help improve acquisition outcomes.  Non-continuous learning modules require supervisory approval.  Trainees may find the latest Core Plus guidance for recommended modules according to assignment type at DAU’s iCatalog (see Part II, Section C for a link).  Trainees may sign up for DAU courses (classroom, web based, and continuous learning modules) at the ACQ Now website (see Part II, Section C for a link).  3. Continuous Learning (CL).  In accordance with DoDI 5000.66, Paragraph E2.2.8.1., members shall acquire 80 continuous learning points (CLPs) every two years.  Members of the AT&L Workforce and their supervisors shall establish individually tailored plans for continuous learning in order to increase functional proficiency, maintain currency, increase leadership and cross-functional competencies, and keep pace with initiatives in the dynamic AT&L environment.  The Core Plus Development Guides shown in the DAU Catalog outline which CL courses are most applicable to a particular type of assignment.  Air Force acquisition personnel are required to record CL points for credit using the online ACQ Now CL system (see Part II, Section C for a link).   33 SECTION C – SUPPORT MATERIALS  The below training and reference materials are maintained on the Air Force Contracting Central Force Development site at:  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/force_development/Pages/1102CFETP.aspx   Acquisition Professional Development Program Resources ACMS AFPC Secure Apps  ACMS https://w20.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFPCSecureNet20/PKI/AppRedir.aspx?appID=49 https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnowcert/approval/logon.aspx  Requesting APDP Certification (ACQ Now) Continuous Learning Events (ACQ Now) Register for DAU Training (ACQ Now) AF Acquisitions Website DACM Site on AF Portal Find APDP Certification Requirements (DAU iCatalog) Position Grade and APDP Certification Level Guidance Guidelines for Crediting Continuous Learning Activities https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnowcl/default.asp?page=main.asp https://www.atrrs.army.mil/channels/acqnow/  http://ww3.safaq.hq.af.mil/career/index.asp https://www.my.af.mil/gcssaf/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC1348B50FB5E044080020E329A9  http://icatalog.dau.mil/onlinecatalog/CareerLvl.aspx  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c88B4F00B3EF1A1AA01403EB44A2F1D12&channelPageId=s6925EC1348B50FB5E044080020E329A9&programId=t88B4F00B3EF1A1AA01403E8C52381CFD  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c6925EC19780A0FB5E044080020E329A9&channelPageId=s6925EC1348B50FB5E044080020E329A9&programId=tA4057E1F3EF1D1EA013EF545EF510018     Career Development Resources Career Development and Progression Resources Career Broadening Program Civilian Development Resource Center https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/8131/kw/career%20broadening/p/1%2C2  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=sE3494DD04855F471014856506046004D  https://cs.eis.af.mil/airforcecontracting/force_development/Pages/FDHome.aspx   AF Contracting Central – Force Development DE and Continuing Education Resources CDE Eligibility Contracting Career Field Tuition Assistance Guide Civilian Continuum of Learning Records View Your Career Brief https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/categories/p/1%2C2/c/549  https://cs.eis.af.mil/airforcecontracting/force_development/Contracting%20Career%20Field%20Management/Contracting%20Career%20Field%20Tuition%20Assistance%20Guide.pdf  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=cA4057E1F408E0C890140F432D7380BA7&channelPageId=s6925EC134EE60FB5E044080020E329A9&programId=tA4057E1F408E0C890140F391F7B00B85  https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/18786/p/1,2  34 https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/18790/p/1,2  https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/contentView.do?contentType=EDITORIAL&contentId=c88B4F00B3EF1A1AA01403ED26C9C1D18&channelPageId=s6925EC1348B50FB5E044080020E329A9&programId=t88B4F00B3EF1A1AA01403E8D862A1D03   http://www.ncmahq.org/  http://npma.org/Index.aspx  http://www.ism.ws/  View Your Electronic Official Personnel File Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES) Coding Instructions Professional Association Resources National Contract Management Association (NCMA) National Property Management Association (NPMA) Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Training Resources AF Contracting Central Webpages Better Buying Power Contracting Operations Enlisted UGT Self-study Materials Force Development Knowledge Center Learning Center Pricing Center Strategic Sourcing Webinar Training Supervisory Resources Harvard Business Modules on Feedback, Appraisals, and Team Management (Available through ACQ Now/DAU) https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/BetterBuying/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/contracting_ops/Pages/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/EnlistedUGT/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/force_development/Pages/FDHome.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/knowledge_center/Pages/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/training_repository/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/PricingCenter/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/strategicsourcing/Pages/default.aspx  https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/aftiwebinars/default.aspx  HBS301 -
