The Career Field Enlisted Training Program (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document identifying life cycle education and training requirements, training support resources, and minimum requirements for personnel of an Air Force specialty. The CFETP provides a career path to success in all parts of career field training and serves as the “Contract for Training” between Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and career field.  Note: Part II guides and supports qualification training to civilians occupying associated duty positions.  2. The CFETP consists of two parts. Supervisors use both parts to plan, manage, and control specialty training.  2.1. Part I provides information for overall management of a specialty.  2.1.1. Section A explains how the plan is used.  2.1.2. Section B identifies progression information, duties and responsibilities, training decisions and career field path.  2.1.3. Section C associates each level with qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training and other as defined).  2.1.4. Section D displays resource constraints.  2.1.5. Section E identifies training guide requirements for a Staff Sergeant (SSgt) – Master Sergeant (MSgt) transition.  3. Part II includes:  3.1. Section A explains the Specialty Training Standard (STS). This includes duties, tasks, and technical references that support local training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core task, and correspondence course requirements.  3.2. Section B contains the course objective list and training standards. Supervisors use these to determine when airmen satisfy training requirements.  3.3. Section C identifies available support materials—often-developed Qualification Training Package (QTP) used to support proficiency training.  3.4. Section D identifies the training course index. Supervisors use this to determine available resources to support training. Mandatory and optional courses and exportable courseware are included. 4 3.5. Section E identifies Major Command (MAJCOM) unique training requirements supervisors use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification need.  3.6. Section F identifies home station training references and course material required for this specialty in support of contingency and wartime training.  4. Guidance provided in the CFETP ensures individuals in this specialty receive effective training to produce desired results at the appropriate interval in their career. This plan enables supervisors’ to train today’s workforce for tomorrow’s jobs.    5 Abbreviations  A1C—Airman 1st Class ABC—Atomic, Biological, Chemical ADLS—Advanced Distributed Learning Service AETC—Air Education and Training Command AF—Air Force AFCEC—Air Force Civil Engineer Center AFCFM—Air Force Career Field Manager AFECD—Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory AFH—Air Force Handbook AFI—Air Force Instruction AFIT—Air Force Institute of Technology AFMAN—Air Force Manual AFOSH—Air Force Occupational Safety and Health AFPAM—Air Force Pamphlet AFPD—Air Force Policy Directive AFQTP—Air Force Qualification Training Package AFRC—Air Force Reserve Command AFS—Air Force Specialty AFSC—Air Force Specialty Code AFTR—Air Force Training Record ALE—Advanced Leadership Experience ALS—Airman Leadership School AMN—Airman ANG—Air National Guard ARC—Air Reserve Component CBR—Chemical, Biological, Radiological CBRN—Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear CBRNE—Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High Yield Explosive CBT—Computer Based Training CCA—Contamination Control Area CCAF—Community College of the Air Force CDC—Career Development Course CE—Civil Engineer CFETP—Career Field Education and Training Plan CMSgt—Chief Master Sergeant COL—Course Objective List CRA—Contingency Ready Airman DAFSC—Duty Air Force Specialty Code DAGR—Defense Advanced GPS Receiver DL—Distance Learning 6 DOD—Department of Defense DODD—Department of Defense Directive DODI—Department of Defense Instruction DRF—Disaster Response Force DRU—Direct Reporting Unit EM—Emergency Management EPME—Enlisted Professional Military Education EMWG—Emergency Management Working Group EOC—Emergency Operations Center ESL—Equipment & Supplies Listing ETCA—Education and Training Course Announcements FEMA—Federal Emergency Management Agency FOA—Field Operating Agency GPS—Global Positioning System HAZMAT—Hazardous Material HQ—Headquarters HST—Home Station Training ILE—Intermediate Leadership Experience JSGPM—Joint Service General Purpose Mask MAJCOM—Major Command MFM—MAJCOM Functional Manager MOPP—Mission Oriented Protective Posture MSgt—Master Sergeant MTT—Mobile Training Team NCOA—Noncommissioned Officer Academy OJT—On-the-Job Training OPR—Office of Primary Responsibility PME—Professional Military Education Prime BEEF—Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force RD&A—Research, Development, and Acquisition SAV—Staff Assistance Visit SDA—Special Duty Assignment SMSgt—Senior Master Sergeant SNCOA—Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy SORTS—Status of Resources and Training System SrA—Senior Airman STS—Specialty Training Standard TIS—Time In Service TO—Technical Order TSgt—Technical Sergeant UGT—Upgrade Training 7 UTC—Unit Type Code UTM—Unit Training Manager WAPS—Weighted Airman Promotion System WIT—Wing Inspection Team WMD—Weapon of Mass Destruction   8 Terms  Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM).

Purpose of the CFETP. Provide information for Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM); commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct a life-cycle career field training program. Outlines training individuals require in the Air Force Specialty (AFS) to develop and advance throughout a career. Identifies initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training. Serves as a contract between Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and a Functional Community.   A1.1. Initial skills training is AFS specific training an individual receives on entry into the Air Force or on retraining into the specialty for award of the 3-skill level. One of the AETC technical training centers usually conducts the training.   A1.2. Upgrade training identifies mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill level.  A1.3. Qualification training is hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an individual in a specific duty position. This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process. Qualification training design provides the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job. A1.4. Advanced training is formal specialty training for selected individuals.   A1.5. Proficiency training is additional training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade. Either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses or on-the-job training is used. The CFETP has several purposes:  A1.5.1. Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program. Helps supervisors identify training at the appropriate interval during an individual’s career.     A1.5.2. Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty. Recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. A1.5.3. Lists available specialty training courses and identifies training sources and delivery methods. A1.5.4. Identifies major resource constraints affecting complete implementation of desired career field training process. A2. Uses of the CFETP. MAJCOM Functional Manager (MFM) and all supervision levels use the plan ensuring complete and consistent training program availability for each individual.  A2.1. AETC training personnel along with AFCFM develop or revise formal resident, nonresident, field, and exportable training based on requirements established by the users and documented in CFETP Part II.  A2.2. MFM ensures MAJCOM-level training programs complement mandatory CFETP initial, upgrade and proficiency requirements. Satisfy identified requirements using OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses. Identify all MAJCOM-developed training supporting this Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) for inclusion into the plan.  12 A2.3. Unit Training Managers (UTM) and supervisors ensure each individual completes mandatory training requirements (including MAJCOM supplemental requirements) for upgrade training specified in the training plan.  A2.4. Each individual completes the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan. Use courses listed in Part II as a reference to support training.  A3. Coordination and Approval of the CFETP. AFCFM is (official and final) approval authority for all CFETP change actions. AFCFM initiates an annual document review to ensure currency and accuracy. MAJCOM representatives and AETC personnel identify and coordinate career field training requirements. Using courses listed in Part II helps eliminate duplicate training.      13 Section B—Career Field Progression and Information  B1. Specialty Descriptions.

In-residence or correspondence course required for Air National Guard (ANG) and Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC).  B9. Training Decisions. CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Emergency Management career field. The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements. The strategy must be clear and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed training approach. The following chart depicts the building block approach.    18               B9.1. Initial Skills Training. The 3-level apprentice course was content reviewed. Additions, deletions, and modifications were made to the course using Contingency Ready Airman (CRA) as the guiding criteria. Core training tasks were identified. B9.2. Five Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Existing CDC was reviewed to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.  B9.3. Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements. Craftsman course requirements were reviewed and determination made that an in-residence course remains necessary. FSTR EM Manager Manager MSgt  - CMSgt MSgt  - CMSgt FSTR Operations EM Operations Planning & Directing Planning & Directing SSgt  - MSgt SSgt  - MSgt Readiness and EM Flight Tasks Readiness Flight Tasks & & CBRN Reconnaissance Team CBRN Reconnaissance Team Operations Operations AB  - SSgt AB  - SSgt 9 - Level 9 - Level & & CEM CEM 7 - Level 7 - Level 7 - Level 5 - Level 5 - Level 3 - Level 3 - Level B9.4. Proficiency Training. A minimum standard set of reoccurring proficiency tasks emergency management personnel must be proficient in to meet deployment challenges identified in the career field AF Form 1098. Many tasks identified as proficiency requirements are identified as Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) reportable requirements. B9.5. MAJCOMS and/or flight management has the flexibility to determine those best suited as the certifier. Individuals identified by the commander as OJT certifiers also may serve as certifiers for the Emergency Management Proficiency Program. Another choice is to use the emergency management individuals the commander appointed as Wing Inspection Team (WIT) representatives for evaluation purposes. B9.6. Emergency management personnel have several avenues to complete proficiency requirements. Requirements can be part of the in-house training program, can be evaluated as part of a WIT exercise, and incorporated into CE Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) days. Lower level certification is associated to task performance. EM Manager-level certification relies more on knowledge, analysis, application, and proficiency.  B9.7. Emergency Management Proficiency Program serves as both a career field wide set of standards and provides the force with a career path to show where they should be for their duties. It also provides an avenue to decertify an individual if they cannot meet the standards. Failure or refusal to progress and keep individual proficiency equal to rank may be grounds for reduction in grade. B9.8. Air Force Training Record (AFTR) contains one AF Form 1098 tab identifying the required 3E9X1 Special Task Certification and Recurring Training tasks: B9.8.1. AF Form 1098 is established by the Career Field Manager (3E900) and mandatory for all 3E9X1 personnel. Use it to set tasks at minimum standard for recertification. B9.9. Items identified with an asterisk are critical tasks. When a member fails to demonstrate proficiency (in any critical area), he or she is not proficient at that level.  19  B9.9.1. This does not automatically prevent them from proficient consideration at that level.  The reason is that many non-critical tasks are also considered.  Reasoning of the certifying official determines (failure of more than one noncritical item by the student) whether the individual continues to perform the duties required to meet the intent of the proficiency program.  B10. Community College of the Air Force (CCAF). Enrollment in CCAF occurs on award of primary AFSC. CCAF provides the opportunity to earn an Associate of Applied Sciences Degree.

Obtain the AFCEM program guide and application package electronically on the R&EM Flight SharePoint site.  Figure B10.6.5. Air Force EM Program Certification Levels.      30   B10.7. Civil Engineer (CE) Occupational Badge. The Civil Engineer occupational badge reflects a great history and tradition. By wearing the badge, fellow Airmen recognize you as having achieved an expected level of competence. The multitude of engineers before you established this expectation through excellent service in peace and war. Eligibility criteria for award and wear of AF occupational badges is found in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2923, Aeronautical, Duty, and Occupational Badges.  Master  Basic  Senior  Civil Engineer Badge Heraldry  Historically, the gearwheel and compass represent the engineering profession in both the military and civilian sector. The gear represents the essence of engineering—applying scientific principles and technology to practical ends. To Air Force engineers, the gear symbolizes an element (representing the built environment) that complements other environments (weapon systems and trained personnel) to enable the Air Force to perform its mission. The compass is a precision tool used by engineers to design and construct facilities and equipment. Together, the gear and compass symbolize all the diverse specialties within Air Force Civil Engineer. Beyond doubt, the wings helped to portray the fundamental linkage between the engineering and aviation components—the built environment is the foundation supporting the Air Force mission and people. B10.8. Civil Engineer Occupational Badge Wear Criteria.    B10.8.1. Basic Badge. Awarded on successful completion of the USAF Emergency Management Apprentice and CBRN Responder Courses at Ft Leonard Wood, Missouri.  B10.8.2. Senior Badge. Adds a star above the basic badge and award is after the member successfully completes all 7-level requirements.  B10.8.3. Master Badge. Adds a wreath and a star above the basic badge and award is to master sergeants or above with 5-years in the specialty from award of the 7-skill level.   31     B10.9. Emergency Management Career Field History. Trace the history of the Air Force Emergency Management program existing today back through the Airmen and events in Air Force history that led to evolvement of the career field. There are two aspects of AF Emergency Management both separate and integrated simultaneously; Emergency Management career field (people) and the Emergency Management program (policies, equipment, and training) that affect the Air Force. B10.9.1. AFEM is associated early on with the Army Chemical Warfare Service (CWS). During World War I to counter the use of chemicals in the trenches of France, Congress designated the CWS as a permanent branch of the Army in 1920. Before World War II, the CWS became the Army Chemical Corp. The U.S. Army Bomber Command, U.S. Army Strategic Air Command (SAC), and the Army Chemical Corp units belonged to SAC when World War II ended. In 1947, when the U.S. Air Force became its own military service it adopted the chemical and biological units throughout the Air Force. Radiological inclusion followed to ensure establishment of programs to protect against radiological effects. B10.9.2. Evolving from a managed program to a career field occurred when the Passive Defense career field established in the 1950s assumed the Atomic, Biological and Chemical (ABC) program. Each installation had one company grade officer, and two or three Junior NCOs to ensure the base populace was prepared for nuclear attacks, and training of forces in chemical warfare defense. Later, the program renamed as the Disaster Control career field and additional responsibilities added in the areas of natural disasters and major accident planning and response. B10.9.3. The career field renamed in the 60s to Disaster Preparedness. This lasted until the early 90s when it aligned under Civil Engineering and the enlisted AFSC designated as 3E9X1, Readiness. The officer career field dissolved and duties assumed by Civil Engineer Readiness Officers. These duties and responsibilities have advanced. The basic responsibility remained focused on consolidating a single program, whether at the installation level, MAJCOM or Air Staff, to prepare, plan, train, and equip personnel to respond to, maintain mission capability, and recover from contingencies worldwide. B10.9.4. While the career field remained as Readiness—in 2003, the Disaster Preparedness Program changed to Full Spectrum Threat Response (FSTR). FSTR is the single integrated Air Force program to coordinate and organize efforts to manage, prepare for, respond to, and recover from the direct and indirect consequences of an emergency or attack. B10.9.5. Air Force FSTR Program primary missions—save lives, minimize the loss or degradation of resources and continue, sustain, and restore combat and combat support operational capability in an 'all hazards' physical threat environment at worldwide AF installations. B10.9.6. Ancillary missions of the FSTR Program—support homeland security operations and to provide support to civil and host nation authorities according to DOD directives and through the appropriate Combatant Command. B10.9.7 The CSAF signed Program Action Directive (PAD) 07-02 on 19 April 2007 and implemented many of Air Force Smart Operations (AFSO) 21 initiatives. Besides the changes directed by the PAD, the Civil Engineer Readiness Flight was named as the Readiness and Emergency Management Flight. This action was followed by change—AFSC 3E9X1 from 'Readiness' to 'Emergency Management'.        32    B10.10. Emergency Management Occupational Badge. The Emergency Management Occupational Badge reflects the achievements gained by our professionalism in Emergency Management and CBRN defense, in peace and war. The worldwide terrorist threat to use CBRN materials continues to increase. B10.10.1. In critical life-threatening situations, any delay in conducting an efficient response could result in major loss of life or mass casualties. As Emergency Management professionals, we work closely with other DOD, civil, and international CBRN specialists who recognize this insignia as a universal identifier.  B10.10.2. During Operations ENDURING FREEDOM and IRAQI FREEDOM, the U.S. Air Force recognized the need for a means to identify the Emergency Management career field unique capability and lobbied for adoption of the insignia.  B10.10.3. Air Force Chief of Staff approved the Readiness Occupational Badge on 7 February 2006. The badge labelled as the Emergency Management Occupational Badge occurred after the career field name was changed. Wearing the badge with the CE Occupational Badge reveals EM ties to CE and provides recognition for possessing distinctive, technical, and specialized CBRN defense capabilities.  33  B10.11. Emergency Management Badge Heraldry. The CSAF officially introduced the Emergency Management Occupational Badge in February 2006. 1 October 2006 is the official wear date.  Master  Basic  Senior  Emergency Management Badge Heraldry  The badge uses the Air Force wreaths combined with basic insignia first adopted by the U.S. Army Chemical Service in 1917: two crossed retorts—glass laboratory vessels used for hundreds of years—placed behind a benzene ring, the molecular building block of many organic chemicals. The benzene ring represents the molecular composition of the chemical benzene. It has six points for each atom of carbon and hydrogen, representing the basic elements of chemistry. These elements of design allude to our chemical-related works and our deeply rooted history in the U.S. Army Air Corps to today’s modern Air Force. The new badge identifies Emergency Management Airmen as CBRN defense experts. Three levels of the badge—basic, senior, and master—represent increasing intervals and levels of expertise in the career field. Throughout history, there has been no way to identify United States Air Force CBRN defense technicians in a joint, combined, or civil environment. The Emergency Management Occupational Badge is similar to the badge used by the Army—contains a retort, an emblem used by the U.S. government since World War I to symbolize chemical readiness. Wearing the chemical retort immediately identifies Emergency Management personnel as CBRN specialists and bridges the gap between joint, combined, and civil operations, to promote operational effectiveness in an increasingly interoperable environment.   B10.12. Emergency Management Occupational Badge Wear Criteria.      B10.12.1. Basic Badge. Awarded on successful completion of the USAF Emergency Management Apprentice and CBRN Responder Courses at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. B10.12.2. Senior Badge. Adds a star above the basic badge and is awarded after the member successfully completes all 7-level requirements. B10.12.3. Master Badge. Adds a wreath and a star above the basic badge and is awarded to master sergeants or above with five years in the specialty from award of the 7-skill level.  34 Section C—Skill Level Training Requirements  C1.

This STS is used for technical training provided by AETC for the 3-level course with the class beginning 8 January 2015 and graduating 17 April 2015 and the 7-level course with the class beginning 26 January 2015 and graduating 6 February 2015.  A2. Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and in collaboration with The Civil Engineer, and Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record. The automated training record currently used to document upgrade and qualification training is an application located on the CE-VLC.  A2.1. Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.   A2.2. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies core tasks (specialty wide training requirements) by an asterisk (*) in the appropriate skill level sub column. Note: As a minimum, trainees must complete hands-on certification on all (core, critical, and diamond) tasks for skill level upgrade. A2.2.1. Wartime Tasks. All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks. In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks are taught at the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.  A2.2.2. Diamond Tasks. Tasks identified by a diamond (♦) are considered contingency/war task and are critical to the career field. Equipment shortfalls at most locations have created problems with actual hands-on certification of these tasks.  A2.2.2.1. During instances when required equipment is not available for instruction, completion of the corresponding task AFQTP is all that is required for upgrade/qualification training.  A2.3. Column 3 (Certification for OJT) is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use the automated training record application to document technician qualifications. Note: Task certification of core and critical tasks require a training completion date and initials of the trainee, trainer, and certifier. All noncore tasks require a training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  A2.4. Column 4 (Proficiency Codes Used to Indicate Training/Information Provided) shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. It reveals the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate because of training on the task, knowledge and the career knowledge provided by formal courses, WBT and AFQTPs. See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit education and training manager for current CDC listings.  A2.5. Identifies Qualitative Requirements. Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by Advanced Distributed Learning System (ADLS), resident training, and career development courses.   42  A2.6. Job Qualification Standard (JQS). The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in the automated training application and used according to AFI 36-2201. For OJT, the tasks in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures. When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  A2.6.1. Documentation. Document and certify completion of training.  A2.6.2. Duty Position. Duty position requirements are developed and identified by the work center supervisor and loaded into the automated training application. Completion of core, critical, and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions. Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under the Profile 1 section of the trainee’s automated training record.  A2.6.3. AFQTP Training and Documentation. AFQTP or AFQTP assessments have been created for all core (*) and diamond (♦) tasks. Completion is mandatory to fulfill task knowledge requirements for upgrade/qualification training. Each AFQTP provides step-by-step procedures for the trainee, trainer, and certifier in completing each core or diamond task and instructions how to document the training in the automated training record.  A2.6.3.1. Training. Documentation of the start and completion of the AFQTP in the QTP section located in the automated training record is required for all core and diamond tasks. The automated training record does not allow you to sign off tasks in the JQS until the completion date is entered.  A2.6.3.1.1. Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the review and post-test located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on the CE-VLC to determine if the trainee attained the knowledge level required.  A2.6.3.1.2. When the trainee completes the web-based course or AFQTP assessment; the course completion certificate must be provided to the trainer/supervisor for documentation of the completion in the automated training record. Also includes completion of hands-on training, when the equipment is available.   A2.6.3.2. Hands-On Training. Do not sign off the JQS task until the trainee has completed hands-on training. For diamond tasks, when the equipment is not available at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP assessment is the only requirement for upgrade. When the equipment becomes available at home station or at a TDY location, the trainee can be signed off within the JQS section of the automated training record. A2.7. Transcribing from previous versions to the new CFETP. Most items should transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP. The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core, diamond, or noncore tasks and add those tasks to their duty positions.    43      A2.7.1. Previous training certification not listed. When previous training certification is not listed in the individual record, select the parent task to be transcribed, check the task title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button. Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the task(s). The trainee then signs off the task(s) to finalize the transcription of previous training certification. The automated application places an entry to the trainee 623a and must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee. A2.7.2. Transcribing external training certification. When a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date. When the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog. When it is not listed in the master catalog, contact the Force Development Manager at Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC) to have it loaded in the master catalog.  A2.8. Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies STS training references the trainee requires for career knowledge according to AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  A2.8.1. Supervisor ensures as a minimum that trainees review all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  A2.8.2. For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander takes appropriate action listed in AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be documented before submitting a CDC waiver. A2.9. Decertification. When an Airman is determined to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title. The supervisor:  A2.9.1. Selects the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the task was decertified. Next, enter the airman into qualification training.  A2.9.1.1. Recertify an individual by using the normal certification process. A2.10. Recertification. When an airman requires recertification on a previous task because of annual or bi-annual requirements. The supervisor:  A2.10.1. Shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title, select the Recertify button on the screen, and enter the dates the recertification was completed. A2.11. Training Standard. Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. This equates to a 3c in the proficiency code key. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  A3. Specialty Training Standard. The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  A3.1. Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields develop Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) at the USAF Airman Advancement Division.   44   A3.1.1. SKT tests sample knowledge contained within the STS subject matter areas. Test development team members consider which tests are appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  A3.1.2. Test questions are based on study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog.  A3.1.3. Individual responsibilities are located in AFI 36-2605, AF Military Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces. A4. Recommendations. AETC welcomes comments and recommendations about the quality of training AETC graduates receive. Reference specific STS paragraphs and address correspondence about changes to 782 TRG/TGE, 917 Missile Road, Bldg. 1917, Sheppard AFB TX 76311.  A4.1. Various graduates may have received over or under training on task/knowledge items listed in this training standard.

Measurement indications of each objective as follows:  B1.1. Written Test (W). Used to sample each knowledge objective and the knowledge component of performance objectives.  B1.2. Performance Test (P). Used under specified conditions in a formal testing mode to measure student accomplishment of performance objectives after the teaching or learning activity is completed.  B1.3. Progress Checks (PC). Administered by the instructor during classroom or laboratory instruction time to assess the student’s accomplishment of knowledge or performance objectives.  B2. Standard. Standards for written and performance measurement are indicated in the objectives and described on the individual progress checklist. Instructor assistance is provided during the progress check as needed. Until attainment of satisfactory performance, students may be required to repeat all or parts of the behavior.  B3. Proficiency Level. Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient). The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  B4. COL. Objectives are listed in the sequence taught by block of instruction.  B4.1. Initial Skills Course.

There are currently no MAJCOM unique requirements.     49 Section F—Home Station Training (HST)  F1. Purpose. To identify the tasks, training references, and training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training. Prime BEEF forces will train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment. Training ranges from knowledge-type training conducted in a classroom (Category [CAT] I), to task-oriented hands-on (CAT II) training conducted in the field. AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program lists these training requirements, frequencies, and sources.  F1.1. HST Definition. Training conducted at the individual’s home station for contingency operations. The CE commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. HST requirements fall into two categories, CAT I and CAT II.      F1.2. CAT I Training. Personnel assigned to base level CE units will receive initial and refresher training in all CAT I (knowledge-based) topics identified in AFI 10-210. Units will use Demonstration Performance Packages, Qualification Training Packages (QTPs), web-based training products, other multimedia training packages, and AF CE standardized lesson plans to present the material. MAJCOMs may develop and require other training materials to accomplish knowledge-based training. F1.3. CAT-II Training. CAT II training is primarily hands-on training as outlined in AFI 10-210. Units must make every effort to incorporate realism into their respective CAT II training programs. Field gear (to include primary weapons) will be used during training requirements such as personal or work party security, convoy operations, defensive fighting positions and so forth. F1.3.1. Combat Skills Training (CST). An integral part of any CAT II HST program is to require CST. Lessons learned from operations such as IRAQI FREEDOM have taught the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness. Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a high threat combat environment, the steps taken to enhance CAT II training helps to elevate units to a readiness level capable of supporting safe and effective operations in low to medium risk combat environments. F1.3.2. Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEET). Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers do not use in their day-to-day operations. Because of cost and complexity, mission essential contingency equipment, and trainer expertise at Continental United States (CONUS) installations is rare. Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFEPT.  F1.3.2.1. AFI 10-210, Prime Base Engineer Emergency Force (BEEF) Program. Identifies minimum personnel for training, positions by specialty, frequencies, and locations of training sites. Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively affect Air Force contingency operations. F1.4. CAT III Training. CAT III is primarily a team-training setting. Silver Flag Exercise Site training is CAT III training. Silver Flag Exercise Sites are located at Tyndall AFB, FL; Ramstein AB, Germany; and Andersen AFB, Guam. These sites conduct CAT III training with a major focus on students being able to perform critical contingency task in a team environment. Training focuses on bare base bed down and sustainment operations using hands-on training with Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources (BEAR) equipment in a realistic bed down environment.   50 F1.4.1. Where possible, added combat skills training to the curriculum ensures realism and helps fortify combat skills thinking among teams. All CE personnel filling Unit Type Code (UTC) positions receive team training at Silver Flag Exercise Sites except for members on headquarters staff augmentation UTCs, pavement evaluation UTCs, and generator repair and maintenance UTCs.   F1.5. HST Training References. F1.5.1. AFI 10-210. Identifies the Prime BEEF recurring training requirements. Review this document on the Air Force e-Publishing website at http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/.  F1.5.2. Air Force Pamphlet (AFPAM) 10-219 Series. Assist with home station training and contingency responses.  F1.5.3. Air Force Handbook (AFH) 10-222 Series. Provides expeditionary engineer craftsmen with how to operating and maintenance procedures.  F1.5.4. AETC Courses.

(Example: b and 1b) A subject knowledge scale value is used alone to define a level of knowledge for a subject not directly related to any specific task, or for a subject common to several tasks. This mark is used alone instead of a scale value to show that no proficiency training is provided in the course or CDC. Used in course columns to show training is required and not provided because of resource constraints (Example “3c/X”). Lower code (3c/2b) indicates a task trained to a level lower than required. This triangle symbol indicates a QTP is available for the given task. This triangle symbol indicates the QTP is under development for the given task. * ** _ /X ▲   Specific tasks not identified with a symbol or proficiency code key (blank) indicates no training is provided in the course or CDC. Major commands and/or units may establish scale values and combat training as dictated by mission requirements.  Note 1: Task Knowledge gained at Basic Military Training does not repeat during resident technical training. Note 2: Underlined training references are commercial publications or other publications essential for enlisted specialty training and mission accomplishment. Note 3: Items located in column 4 of the STS listing a National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) standard as a technical reference, the supporting knowledge/tasks, and associated behaviors are found in the referenced NFPA standard.

AFQTPs. Ensure each Emergency Management trainee is trained to the correct standard an AFQTP is developed for each core and diamond tasks identified in their STS. As mandate, these AFQTPs are for use by the trainee, trainer, and certifier in their on-the-job training program. A4.2. AFQTPs. Ensures all aspects of the task are covered sufficiently and provide additional task knowledge in preparation for hands-on training. AFQTPs summarize procedures on a task performance checklist for use by trainers, certifiers, and trainees. A4.2.1.  UTM  or  supervisor  can  download  AFQTP's  from  the  AFCEC—Air  Force  Civil  Engineer Center Force Development (COF) portal page. A4.2.2. In addition to the paper-based AFQTPs there are web-based courses or assessments developed for certain tasks and are available on the CE-VLC under the specialty topic area. A4.3. Documentation. Before a core or diamond task in the JQS section of the individual automated training record is signed off, the task must first be signed off in the QTP section. A4.3.1. Core/Diamond Tasks. To document completion, the supervisor or trainer opens the individual automated training record, navigates to the QTP section, and enters the start and completed date with signatures. A4.3.2. Diamond (♦) Tasks. Supervisors/Trainers do not sign off the corresponding JQS task until the trainee has completed hands-on training. When the required equipment is not available at the location, completion of the task’s AFQTP web-based course or assessment with a passing score of 80% is required for upgrade training. Hands-on certification shall be accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is available. Afterwards, the student can be signed off on the JQS.  71  A4.4. 3E9X1 Core and Diamond Tasks Requirements.  3E9X1 AFQTP and DL Documentation Record   TASK NUMBER TASKS, KNOWLEDGE, AND TECHNICAL REFERENCES AFQTP & DL TITLE   5LEVEL  7LEVEL DATE START  EDATE COMPLETINITIALS TRAINEES' INITIALS TRAINER’S Civil Engineer (CE) Common Core Concepts Courses TR:  CE Virtual Learning Center (CE-VLC) Accomplish CE 3-Level Core Concepts Course CE 3-Level Core Concepts Course Accomplish CE 7-Level Core Concepts Course CE 7-Level Core Concepts Course *   *         Emergency Management Planning TR: AFI 10-211, AFI 10-403, AFI 10-404, AFI 10-503, AFI 32-1007, AFI 10-2501, AFI 32-7062, AFMAN 10-401 Vol. 1/2, AFMAN 10-2502, AFMAN 10-2503, AFMAN 10-2504, AFPAM 10-219 Vol. 2/5, AFTTP 3-2.44, AFTTP 3-2.70 1. 1.1. 1.2. 6. 6.1.
