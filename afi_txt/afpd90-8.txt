SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has only minor administrative changes that include combining two PDs into one. This AFPD establishes the AF ESOH priorities of compliance, risk management, and continuous improvement.    It  updates  office  symbols  and  incorporates  provisions  of  DoDD  4715.1E,  DoDI 4715.17, DoDI 4715.18, DoDI 6055.01, and HAF MD 1-18. 1.  Overview.  This  AFPD  defines  and  establishes  AF  policy  for  ESOH  and  RM  programs.    It directs  the  ESOH  functional  offices  to  implement  guidance  across  the  enterprise.  Additionally, this  AFPD  directs  the  development  of  management  systems  as  related  to  ESOH  mission  and personal  risk  activities.  The  management  process  provides  leaders  with  a  method  to  ensure proper program oversight and to achieve goals and objectives related to all ESOH requirements.  The process also empowers Airmen to make good RM decisions in their daily activities, both on and off duty. 2.  Policy.  ESOH priorities include compliance, risk management, and continuous improvement. Policy elements will be established in accordance with Attachment 3. Section 2A--Compliance 2.1.  Ensure  compliance  with  applicable  federal,  state,  local,  DoD  and  AF  ESOH  statutes, policies, guidance, and regulations. 2.2.  Assign  the  core  mission  areas  the  authority,  responsibility,  and  accountability  for compliance with applicable ESOH requirements. For overseas areas, ensure compliance with the  ESOH  provisions  of  applicable  treaties,  international  law,  bilateral  and  multi-national agreements  [e.g.,  Status  of  Forces  Agreements  (SOFA)],  country  specific  Final  Governing Standards (FGS), or in countries where no FGS exist, the Overseas Environmental Baseline Guidance  Document (OEBGD),  Unified  Combatant  Command,  Major  Command (MAJCOM), and installation-specific requirements. 2.3.  Fund  ESOH  legal  obligations  to  include  infrastructure  requirements  critical  to  ESOH compliance. Section 2B—Risk Management 2.4.  Commanders/Directors shall provide safe and healthy workplaces and conduct training and  real  world  operations  in  a  manner  that  enhances  mission  effectiveness,  preserves resources,  prevents  pollution,  and  minimizes  ESOH  risks  to  AF  personnel  and  the  public both on and off the installation. 2.4.1.  Enhance  mission  effectiveness  at  all  levels,  while  preserving  assets  and safeguarding health and welfare. 2.4.2.  Preserve  resources  by effectiveness in all environments at minimal cost. identifying  opportunities to increase  war  fighting AFPD90-8  14 MARCH 2017 3 2.4.3.  Control/mitigate  pollution  in  the  air,  water,  and  soil  that  may  cause  undue exposure to hazardous chemical, physical, and biological agents. 2.4.4.  Minimize risk to the lowest acceptable level. 2.4.4.1.  The most logical choices for accomplishing a mission are those that meet all requirements while exposing personnel and resources to the lowest acceptable risk. 2.4.4.2.  Integrate  RM  into  mission  and  activity  planning  processes,  ensuring decisions are based upon assessments of risk integral to the activity and mission. 2.4.4.3.  Make  risk  decisions  at  the  appropriate  level;  one  that  can  allocate  the resources to reduce the risk or eliminate the hazard and implement controls. 2.4.5.  Promote safety, health, and environmental stewardship by minimizing ESOH risks through  creating  a  cultural  mindset  in  which  every  leader  and  Airman  is  trained  and motivated to manage risk during all on and off duty activities. 2.5.  The  AF  RM  process  consist  of  the  following  five  primary  steps:  (1)  Identify  the Hazards, (2) Assess the Hazards, (3) Develop Controls and Make Decisions, (4) Implement Controls, (5) Supervise and Evaluate corrective actions. 2.5.1.  Apply the process cyclically and continuously across the full spectrum of military training, operations, and day-to-day activities both on and off duty. 2.5.2.  Apply  RM  during  all  aspects  of  preparing,  developing,  testing,  planning, organizing,  training,  equipping,  sustaining,  and  employing  forces  across  the  conflict continuum of peace and war. 2.6.  Life Cycle Risk Management (LCRM) and Integrated Life Cycle Management (ILCM): 2.6.1.  LCRM  is  based  on  the  same  general  principles  as  AF  RM.  The  key  elements  of LCRM is described in AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management, AFPAM 63-128,  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management,  and  DoDI  5000.02,  Operation  of  Defense Acquisition Systems. 2.6.2.  ILCM  mission  assurance  and  ESOH  risks  are  assessed  and  managed  using  MIL-STD-882, the DoD Standard Practice for System Safety. All high and serious ESOH risks must also be translated and presented on the standard LCRM 5X5 matrix IAW AFI 63-101/20-101.  2.6.3.  When a system is fielded, risk data developed through the program’s LCRM and MIL-STD-882 process should be provided to system users and should inform the users of operational and ESOH RM efforts. Section 2C—Continuous Improvement 2.7.  Ensure  ESOH  programs  in  collaboration  with  other  AF  efficiency  efforts  focus  on mission  accomplishment,  enable  employee  involvement,  and  foster  a  culture  of  continuous improvement. 2.8.  Every Airman must constantly seek to minimize ESOH risks and to improve execution of the AF mission.   4 AFPD90-8  14 MARCH 2017 Section 2D—Management Systems 2.9.  ESOH  Management  System  policy  requires  the  use  of  accepted  management  system principles and meets the performance elements.  Management elements will be established in accordance  with  Attachment  2.    Three  complementary,  but  separate,  management  systems are currently used to support the ESOH program. 2.10.  Implement  information  management  systems  to  support  all  ESOH  programs.  Each functional  agency  should  work  towards  automating  all  aspects  of  their  ESOH  information management  system.    ESOH  management  systems  should  be  automated  such  that  data streams  can  be  shared  to  enhance  the  performance  of  ESOH  capabilities  through  cross-functional analysis and potential interdisciplinary hazard abatement actions. 2.11.  Where  the  individual  systems  overlap,  programs  shall  be  combined  for  maximum performance and optimization of resources. 2.12.  Commanders  will  maintain  a  prioritized  abatement  listing  which  uses  Abatement Priority  Numbers  (APN)  for  each  SOH  and  Fire  Risk  Assessment  Code  (RACs)  1,  2,  or  3 IAW DoDI 6055.01. The APN rank orders SOH and Fire risks/vulnerabilities and allows the commander to make informed decisions. 2.13.  Maintain readiness by providing access to adequate natural infrastructure (NI), such as air, land, water, flora, and fauna assets, to support mission accomplishment. To accomplish this objective, NI shall be assessed and managed to ensure these assets have the capacity to meet current and future mission needs. 2.14.
