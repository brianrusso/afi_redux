Shoults) Pages: 45 Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  10-2608,  Disease  Containment,  implements  Department  of Defense  (DOD)  Global  Campaign  Plan  (GCP)  for  Pandemic  Influenza  and  Infectious  Disease (PI&ID)  3551-13,  and  provides  Air  Force  installations  with  the  guidance  necessary  to  develop installation-level  disease  containment  plans  (DCP)  that  ensure  Force  Health  Protection  (FHP) and  Continuity  of  Operations  (COOP)  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  Department  of  Defense Directive  (DODD)  2060.02,  Department  of  Defense  Combating  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction (WMD)  Policy,  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DODI)  6200.03,  Public  Health  Emergency Management within the Department of Defense, and DODD 6200.04, Force Health Protection. The resulting DCPs will allow installations to respond to public health emergencies and diseases of operational significance, while enabling mission recovery and sustainment. AFMAN 10-2608 implements  provisions  contained  in  Air  Force  Policy  Directive  (AFPD)  10-26,  Countering-Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  Enterprise,  and  AFPD  10-25,  Emergency  Management.  It provides  guidance  for  installations/wings  to  incorporate  comprehensive  disease  containment planning as part of the all hazards planning directed by Air Force Instruction (AFI) 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management Program, and supports implementation of AFI 10-2519, Public Health  Emergencies  and  Incidents  of  Public  Health  Concern,  which  specifies  the  authority  of Installation  Commanders  and  assigns  responsibilities  for  declaring,  reporting,  and  managing  a public health emergency. This manual applies to all installations/wings and activities under Air Force command (hereafter referred to collectively as “installations”), to the Headquarters Air Force (HAF), to the Air Force Reserve  Command,  to  the  Air  National  Guard  (ANG),  and  to  other  geographically  separated 2 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 units (GSU). The ANG will supplement this manual to clarify the level  of disease containment planning their forces can accomplish due to manning, mission, and funding constraints. The term “commanders,” as used in this manual, refers to commanders at the installation and wing (for Air Reserve  Component)  level  unless  specifically  stated  otherwise.  The  manual  also  applies  to military personnel and, to the extent permissible by law, DOD civilian personnel, dependents of military or DOD civilian personnel, contractors, and other individuals visiting or who are present on  an  Air  Force  installation  (collectively  referred  to  as  “non-military  personnel”);  Air  Force facilities;  Air  Force-owned,  -leased,  or  -managed  infrastructure  and  assets  critical  to  mission accomplishment;  and  other  Air  Force-owned,  -leased,  or  -managed  mission  essential  assets overseas and in the United States, its territories, and possessions. Air  Force  units  in  Joint  Basing  situations,  whether  in  the  supporting  or  supported  role,  must ensure their personnel are adequately protected and cared for during a public health emergency or  disease  of  operational  significance.  IAW  Joint  Basing  Implementation  Guidance  (JBIG), supported/supporting units should implement Memorandums of Agreement (MOA) to establish standards of support. (T-1) The JBIG also establishes procedures for adjudicating differences and establishing Common Output Level Standards. Units that cannot meet Air Force requirements by exhausting  the  JBIG  adjudication  process  must  coordinate  with  their  Major  Command (MAJCOM)  to  alleviate  discrepancies.  MAJCOMs  that  cannot  resolve  discrepancies  will coordinate with the appropriate HAF office to determine a solution. This  guidance  is  also  applicable  to  domestic  settings  (as  defined  by  continental  United  States (CONUS), Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. territories), as well as in a deployed setting. In areas outside U.S.  control,  this  manual  applies  to  the  extent  consistent  with  local  conditions  and  treaty requirements,  Status  of  Forces  Agreements  (SOFA),  and  other  applicable  arrangements  with foreign  governments  and  allied  forces.  Ultimately,  U.S.  prerogatives  and  control  at  overseas locations  may  require  adjustment  to  accommodate  the  sovereignty  interests  of  the  Host  Nation (HN). The  authorities  to  waive  wing/unit  level  requirements  in  this  publication  are  identified  with  a Tier  (T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3)  number  following  the  compliance  statement.  See  AFI  33-360, Publications  and  Forms  Management,  Table  1.1  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated with the Tier numbers. When complying with official policy, guidance, and/or procedures, a unit may  request  a  waiver.  The  fundamental  aim  of  a  waiver  must  be  to  enhance  mission effectiveness at all levels, while preserving resources and safeguarding health and welfare. When a commander approves a waiver, the commander is communicating to subordinates and superiors that the commander accepts the risk created by non-compliance. Each requirement mandated for compliance  at  the  Wing  level  found  within  this  manual  is  tiered,  signifying  the  appropriate waiver authority to the requirement. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to  the  appropriate  Tier  waiver  approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  Publication  Office  of Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  for  non-tiered  compliance  items.  This  publication  may  be supplemented at any level. Direct Supplements must be routed to the OPR of this publication for coordination prior to certification and approval. Ensure all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are maintained IAW  AFMAN  33-363,  Management  of  Records,  and  disposed  of  IAW  the  Air  Force  Records Disposition Schedule located in the Air Force Records Information Management System.

Ensure  subordinate  assigned  and  attached  units  fuse  FHP  and  disease-specific intelligence collection and analysis with all aspects of FP intelligence analysis. 1.4.  Installation.  The bulk of disease containment activities occur at the individual level (e.g., airmen,  civilian,  contractor,  or  dependent),  thus  the  majority  of  planning  and  preparation activities  occur  at  the  installation  level.  Note:  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  units  and  GSUs may  not  have  the  resident  capability  or  personnel  to  prepare  for  or  respond  to  a  public  health emergency or disease of operational concern. This will ultimately limit a commander’s ability to implement  some  of  the  provisions  of  this  Manual  or  other  functions  of  responsibility.  The Ground  Reserve  Medical  Unit  at  Air  Force  Reserve  stand-alone  installations  will  coordinate Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) between Reserve Wing and local civilian public health authorities  to  enable  a  joint  response  to  public  health  emergencies  or  diseases  of  operational significance affecting the installation population. 1.4.1.  Installation Commander will: 1.4.1.1.  Direct the EMWG to oversee development of a DCP/IEMP 10-2 appendix using the format provided in Chapter 3, which is synchronized with DOD GCP PI&ID 3551-13. Installation plans should also align with applicable GCC Campaign Plans. (T-0; DOD GCP PI&ID 3551-13) 1.4.1.2.  Ensure the installation plan is  supported by sufficient C2 capabilities and other equipment  to  respond  properly  to  public  health  emergencies  or  diseases  of  operational significance. (T-2) AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 11 1.4.1.3.  Train and exercise the plan IAW AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System. (T-1) 1.4.1.3.1.

(T-1) 16 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 Chapter 2 PLANNING FACTORS 2.1.  General.  The more prepared an installation is prior to a biological incident, the greater the commander’s  ability  to  mitigate  effects  of  a  biological  attack,  public  health  emergency,  or disease  of  operational  significance.  Preparatory  actions  consist  of  a  broad  range  of  tasks  and activities  necessary  to  build  and  sustain  operational  capabilities  prior  to,  during,  and  following such  incidents.  Preparedness  is  a  continuous  process  that  involves  all  functional  communities and personnel at every level to identify threats, assess vulnerabilities, and prepare their personnel and  equipment  to  execute  the  measures  required  to  respond  effectively.  Actions  taken  (or  not taken) prior to a biological incident can affect options available to commanders for responding to and recovering from the incident. Diseases of operational significance may require an integrated response from multiple organizations across the base as well as local, state, federal, international, and/or  HN  authorities.  Functional  assignments  to  carry  out  the  tasks  described  in  this  chapter may vary from installation to installation, and commanders will assign roles and responsibilities appropriate to their installation. Note: ARC units and GSUs may not have the resident capability or  personnel  to  prepare  for  or  respond  to  a  public  health  emergency  or  disease  of  operational significance.  This  will  ultimately  limit  a  commander’s  ability  to  implement  some  of  the provisions of this manual. (T-1) 2.2.  Baseline  Assumptions.  Installation  commanders  should  consider  the  following  when planning for a public health emergency or disease of operational significance, and coordinating the installation’s response to contain the disease. 2.2.1.  Initially,  a  disease  caused  by  an  attack  may  be  indistinguishable  from  a  naturally-occurring  outbreak.  In  addition,  due  to  varying  incubation  periods  of  biological  organisms, exposure  may  precede  the  onset  of  illness  by  days  or  weeks.  Biological  toxins  are  an exception because symptoms will generally manifest within hours of exposure. Several days may pass before medical authorities suspect an intentional or deliberate cause. 2.2.2.  Assume  all  outbreaks  are  contagious  until  the  causative  agent  and  mode  of transmission  are  identified.  Initial  response  should  provide  protection  against  all  potential modes of transmission until the causative agent and mode are identified. 2.2.3.  Treatment in place is the DOD policy for highly-contagious patients and aeromedical evacuation  will  likely  not  be  permitted  for  transporting  contagious  casualties.  In  addition, transportation  of  contaminated  human  remains  (CHR),  both  domestically  and  repatriation from  deployed  locations,  will  require  approval  from  the  SecDef  or  higher  authorities.  See USTRANSCOM  Policy  for  Patient  Movement  of  Contaminated  Contagious  or  Potentially Exposed Casualties. 2.2.4.  The  ability  to  execute  installation  MEFs  will  be  degraded  due  to  significant absenteeism caused by a public health emergency or disease of operational significance. 2.2.5.  The  ability  to  conduct  installation  MEFs  will  be  degraded  due  to  limitations  on freedom of movement due to partner nation restrictions. 2.2.6.  U.S.  civil  authorities’  ability  to  maintain  MEFs  will  be  degraded  due  to  significant absenteeism. AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 17 2.2.7.  All AORs will not be affected simultaneously or to the same degree. 2.2.8.  Identification of a contagious outbreak may initially occur at a civilian medical facility or  department  of  health  or  human  hygiene  (or  similar  local  or  state  agency)  giving  DOD some  warning  of  the  PI&ID  outbreak  before  significant  operational  impacts  occur  and allowing commencement of mitigation measures. 2.2.9.  FHP activities can limit/delay the spread of disease. 2.2.10.  Medical  resources  (military,  domestic,  and  foreign)  will  be  overwhelmed,  and medical countermeasures will not be immediately available or 100% effective. 2.2.11.  ARC  units  and  GSUs  will  have  MOUs  or  MOAs  with  appropriate  civilian  public health agencies to identify, coordinate, and prepare for disease containment and identification of biological pathogens to adequately address the requirements of this manual. 2.3.  Public  Awareness.  Public  trust  and  cooperation  during  a  biological  incident  are  critical due  to  the  nature  of  diseases  of  operational  significance.  A  healthy,  well-informed  populace  is better prepared and can respond more effectively. In preparation for and during all phases of an outbreak,  installation  personnel  should  be  made  aware  of  possible  biological  threats,  their effects, recognition of disease symptoms, and expected installation responses. Healthy practices (e.g., diet and exercise) and protective/preventative actions (e.g., hand washing or coughing into one’s sleeve) should be encouraged, especially during the Prepare phase, so they become routine. Frequency and scope of public awareness campaigns should increase commensurate with threat. 2.3.1.  During the Prepare phase, standardized messaging (e.g., incident fact sheets, Straight Talk  Line  messages,  installation/unit  internet-based  updates,  e-mail  messages  to  a distribution list, and/or inputs for command information channels) should be developed to be quickly disseminated to the installation population in the event of a public health emergency or  disease  of  operational  significance.  See  AFI  35-101,  Public  Affairs  Responsibilities  and Management, for additional information. (T-1) 2.3.2.  A  Straight  Talk  Line  and/or  a  media  center  should  be  stood  up  for  use  during  an outbreak.  The  Straight  Talk  Line  could  be  a  receive-only  phone  line,  providing  the installation population with an authoritative POC for current and accurate information about the status  of an incident  and the installation commander's actions. The media center, which could be set up as a Joint Information Bureau, should be in a location easily accessed by both internal and external media sources.  2.3.3.  In  the  prepare  phase,  community  involvement  is  critical  in  the  planning  and preparation  of  plans,  messaging,  and  response  aspects.  Joint  interaction  must  be  conducted with local health departments, MTFs, and Law Enforcement Agencies. 2.4.  Threat/Hazard  Assessment.  Intelligence  /  Office  of  Special  Investigations  must  provide functional  organizations  (e.g.,  Security  Forces,  Medical,  and  Civil  Engineering)  with  an understanding of the biological threat and likely delivery methods. (T-1) 2.5.  Installation Resources.  As part of the DCP development process, the first step in assessing an installation’s capability  to  effectively contain  a disease is  to  conduct  a detailed inventory of existing response resources including equipment, personnel, and training. Non-mission essential manpower  and  designated  augmentation  forces  may  need  to  be  reallocated  to  support  the anticipated  additional  burden  on  certain  functional  communities  such  as  medical/public  health, 18 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 force support, and security forces. In addition, the installation should analyze what resources are made  available  under  support  agreements  with  local  communities  and/or  HNs.  An  installation can augment its resources through  cooperation with local  or regional  agencies, other Air Force and  DOD  resources,  or  the  HN.  These  additional  support  elements  might  include  emergency medical  services,  public  health  offices,  law  enforcement  agencies,  environmental  agencies, communications  capabilities,  transportation  support,  laboratory  facilities  for  confirmative analysis,  and  contracted  response  and  remediation  companies.  Using  this  inventory,  each functional area should determine its ability to respond effectively to a public health emergency or disease of operational significance.  2.5.1.  Basic  Needs.  Due  to  the  nature  of  diseases  of  operational  significance,  re-supply  of basic needs from local or intra-theater sources may not be readily available. If a public health emergency  is  declared  and/or  ROM  is  established,  the  base  population  will  need  basic supplies  sufficient  to  sustain  a  minimum  of  two  disease  incubation  periods.  The  actual duration will be disease-specific; however, for planning purposes the recommended duration is thirty days. 2.5.1.1.  Plan  for/acquire  essential  life-supporting  services  and  supplies  such  as  potable water,  emergency  subsistence,  sanitation,  and  first-response  medical  care  for  the  base populace, as well as quarantine and isolation support. 2.5.1.2.  Because evacuation of biologically-contagious individuals may not be advisable or feasible, consider their basic needs as well. 2.5.1.3.  Normal distribution, re-supply, and refuse plans may be interrupted by the public health  emergency  or  disease  of  operational  significance.  All  plans  and  mutual  aid agreements  (MAA)  should  be  reviewed  and  contingencies  established.  In  addition,  a remote area to off-load supplies should be considered. 2.5.2.  Special Needs. Personnel classified as having special needs due to a medical condition or  religious  belief  may  require  special  care.  Examples  include  altered  immune  states, pregnancy, behavioral casualties, diabetics, or religious dietary restrictions. 2.5.2.1.  Consider retired military personnel, dependents, and other local populations that routinely seek resources or medical care from the installation. 2.5.2.2.  Vaccination plans must also take into account special needs, as some individuals are not able to tolerate vaccination or medical treatment. 2.5.2.3.  Coordinate with appropriate personnel in the local community as they may have considered some of these same populations in their planning efforts. 2.6.  Detection  and  Identification.  The ability to  detect  and identify a biological  incident  will significantly  affect  when  an  installation  can  initiate  response  and  recovery  actions,  and  how effectively  those  actions  minimize  casualties.  During  the  Prepare  phase,  installations  should ensure  their  plans  and  procedures  for  placement  and  monitoring  of  biological  collection equipment  is  up  to  date.  They  should  also  ensure  there  are  sufficient  supplies  to  support execution  of  the  plans.  Installation  Civil  Engineering  and  the  MTF  have  responsibility  for installation  detection  and  identification.  In  addition,  the  Installation  PHEO  will  maintain situational awareness of all installation medical surveillance activities. Public health will ensure AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 19 medical surveillance is accomplished IAW AFI 48-105, Surveillance, Prevention, and Control of Diseases and Conditions of Public Health or Military Significance. (T-1) 2.7.  Alert, Notification, and Reporting.  Alert, notification, and reporting refers to the official processes, protocols, and procedures for public health emergencies found in DODI 6200.03; AFI 10-206;  AFI  10-2519;  and  Air  Force  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  (AFTTP)  3-2.56, Multi-Service Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear  Contamination  Avoidance,  for  CBRN  Warning  and  Reporting  System  (CBRNWRS) procedures including utilization of Joint Warning and Reporting Network software.  In  addition to  standard  operational  reporting  requirements,  the  occurrence  of  a  biological  incident  may create  additional  medical  reporting  requirements.  For  example,  the  discovery  of  a  case  of smallpox or other public health emergency on a military installation would require the PHEO to notify  local  civilian  public  health  officials  or  others  in  the  medical  chain  of  command  and  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Responses to  outbreaks suspected of being deliberate  in  origin  require  consideration  of  special  law  enforcement  procedures  (e.g., establishing and maintaining chain of custody for all clinical or environmental samples submitted and transported for laboratory testing). All  alert,  notification, and reporting  actions should take into  account  operations  security  considerations  and  DOD  release  authority  to  non-military outlets. Since reporting occurs during all phases of an outbreak, the following guidelines should be considered at all times. See Paragraph 1.2.4.4 and  3.4.11 for additional reporting guidance. 2.7.1.  IAW AFI 10-206, the command post should submit Synchronous Report/Voice Report within  15  minutes  from  the  incident;  and  initial  Asynchronous  Report/Record  Copy  within one hour of discovery.  2.7.2.  Reporting  in  the  U.S.  and  its  territories  should  be  done  IAW  established  procedures consistent with the Air Force Incident Management System.  2.7.3.  In addition to AFI 10-206 reporting requirements, units in the U.S. and its territories will report suspected or confirmed biological attacks through the North American Aerospace Defense  Command  (NORAD)  Warning  and  Reporting  System  (reference  NORAD Command Instruction 10-22, Nuclear Biological Chemical Warning and Reporting System). (T-1) 2.7.4.  Outside  the  Continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  reporting  will  be  accomplished IAW AFI  10-206  and  applicable theater directives/operations plans. OCONUS CBRNWRS reports will be submitted IAW AFTTP 3-2.56. (T-1) 2.8.  Individual  Protection.  Installations  must  consider  equipment  requirements  for  functional communities  involved  in  execution  of  disease  containment  procedures.  Each  functional community  will  conduct  appropriate  training  on  equipment  use  during  the  Prepare  phase.  See AFI 10-2501 for additional information on individual protection requirements. (T-1) 2.9.  Integrated  Defense.  Existing  integrated  defense  activities  can  assist  in  preventing  or mitigating  the  effects  following  a  biological  attack  or  naturally-occurring  outbreaks.  Certain integrated  defense  capabilities  (e.g.,  sample  collectors  and  laboratory  identification)  can  be utilized to protect an installation within its physical perimeter. Whereas other integrated defense capabilities  (e.g.,  intelligence  and  law  enforcement  actions)  can  help  to  extend  an  installation's security zone beyond its physical perimeter to provide advance warning of a biological incident. All integrated defense measures must be conducted IAW appropriate laws and regulations. (T-1) 20 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 2.10.  Restriction of Movement.  ROM involves limiting the movement of people to prevent or reduce  person-to-person  transmission  of  diseases  of  operational  significance.  AFI  10-2519 contains guidance regarding emergency health powers that govern the use of ROM. 2.10.1.  ROM may include actions such as social distancing, quarantine, and isolation, among others. 2.10.1.1.  Social distancing is a community-based strategy to increase the physical space between people to prevent person-to-person spread of an infectious disease (e.g., physical separation,  cancellation  of  public  events,  closure  of  schools  and  daycare  facilities, employing a minimum manning policy, telework). 2.10.1.2.  Quarantine may be a voluntary or mandatory ROM placed upon individuals or groups  reasonably  believed  to  have  been  exposed  to  a  communicable  disease.  Absent extraordinary  circumstances  and  specific  orders  to  the  contrary,  active  duty  military enforcement of quarantine should be conducted on military installations only. (See CDC, Public  Health  Guidance  for  Community-Level  Preparedness  and  Response  to  Severe Acute  Respiratory  Syndrome  Version  2,  Supplement  D:  Community  Containment Measures,  Including  Non-Hospital  Isolation  and  Quarantine).  Advance  planning, particularly with respect to providing support to and coordinating with civilian authorities is critical. All quarantine activities must comply with applicable laws and regulations. (T-1)  Consult  the  servicing  Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA)  early  in  the  planning  process  to ensure compliance. See AFI 10-2519 for further guidance.  2.10.1.3.  Isolation differs from quarantine in that it removes obviously ill personnel (i.e., those  displaying  symptoms  of  disease)  from  the  general  population.  Adequate  facilities must be identified and plans developed to provide medical care and meet basic needs of personnel  in  isolation.  All  isolation  activities  must  comply  with  applicable  laws  and regulations.  (T-1)  Consult  the  servicing  SJA  early  in  the  planning  process  to  ensure compliance.  2.10.2.  ROM  and  travel  restrictions  could  obligate  U.S.  government  funds  (e.g.,  per  diem, permanent  change  of  station  delays,  temporary  duty  delays,  and  “stop  movement”  orders). Such  costs  and  obligations  should  be  considered  but  not  override  the  primary  goal  of preventing the spread of the disease. 2.10.3.  The base population should be trained during Phase 0 (See Figure 2.1) to implement ROM techniques when instructed and as required. 2.10.4.  Appropriate  facilities  to  be  utilized  for  quarantine  and  isolation  should  be  pre-identified  to  ensure  they  meet  environmental  and  infection  control  standards.  Another consideration  is  proximity  to  medical  facilities  for  monitoring  and  care.  The  facilities  and environmental  considerations  may  vary  depending  upon  the  causative  agent,  means  of transmission, and the number of potentially-exposed personnel. 2.10.5.  Procedures to ensure appropriate medical personnel have the capabilities and training necessary  to  implement  monitoring  procedures  of  personnel  in  quarantine  and/or  isolation need to be in place prior to implementation of ROM procedures. In addition, it is critical the installation  ensure  availability  of  resources  to  execute  ROM  monitoring  procedures.  Note: The  resources  and  procedures  vary  for  passive  and  active  monitoring  of  personnel.  For example, passive monitoring may require appropriate medical personnel to man phone banks AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 21 to  receive  periodic  updates  from  quarantined  personnel.  Active  monitoring  may  require appropriate medical personnel to conduct visits with personnel placed in a quarantine facility. 2.10.6.  Distribution of required resources to meet medical care and basic needs of personnel placed  in  ROM  must  also  be  planned  during  steady-state  operations  (i.e.,  Phase  0).  The standard distribution of base supplies or MREs  may vary depending upon the situation, the causative agent, and the phase. 2.11.  Decontamination.  Many  variables  determine  the  type  of  decontamination  required,  if required  at  all.  Exposure  to  air  or  weathering  may  be  sufficient  as  many  biological  agents  die quickly  in  the  environment.  Commanders  must  also  prepare  for  resilient,  lingering  agents  and consider  resources/supplies  needed  for  a  long-term  decontamination  response.  Additionally, procedures for the temporary or permanent disposition of equipment and material that cannot be decontaminated must be addressed during planning. 2.11.1.  Plans  for  decontamination  should  include  procedures  and  consumable  supplies, including a plan for distribution and re-supply. 2.11.2.  In  most  cases,  people  exposed  to  biological  agents  will  not  require  processing through  emergency  personnel  decontamination  stations  or  contamination  control  areas (CCA) prior to entering the MTF. 2.11.3.  Based  on  guidance  provided  by  the  MAJCOM/theater,  the  installation  should maintain  decontamination  supplies,  and  operational  decontamination  procedures  should  be trained and exercised regularly.  2.11.4.  Refer  to  U.S.  Army  Public  Health  Command  (USAPHC)  Technical  Guide  195, Safety  and  Health  Guidance  for  Mortuary  Affairs  Operations:  Infectious  Materials  and CBRN Handling, and Joint  Publication (JP) 4-06,  Mortuary Affairs in Joint Operations, for guidance on CHR. 2.12.  Medical  Intervention  and  Treatment.  Medical  intervention  and/or  treatment  can prevent  or  reduce  the  impact  of  infection.  Preparatory  actions  ensure  supplies  are  available  for immediate distribution to personnel. 2.12.1.  The number and type (military, DOD civilians, contractors, dependents) of personnel that may require medical intervention or treatment in the event of a public health emergency or  outbreak  of  a  disease  of  operational  significance  is  an  important  value  to  calculate  to ensure  adequate  planning.  Estimates  should  include  where  these  personnel  will  receive prophylaxis  (i.e.,  on  the  installation  versus  through  private  care  providers)  and  take  into account  planning  factors  such  as  relevant  threats  and  possible  delivery  means,  as  well  as expected quantities of supplies from the SNS. 2.12.2.  Prioritize personnel to receive vaccines or prophylaxis if time or quantity is limited based  on  individual  susceptibility  and/or  mission  criticality.  This  list  will  differ  from  one installation to another and must account for the needs of the entire base population. 2.12.3.  Distribution plans should include alternate locations for distributing prophylaxis and performing  vaccinations.  In  high-threat  environments,  consider  pre-distributing  prophylaxis to personnel based on individual susceptibility and/or mission criticality. 2.12.4.  Consider  conducting  prophylaxis  sensitivity  checks  of  mission  critical  personnel  to pre-determine adverse reactions. 22 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 2.12.5.  Stockpile  medical  treatment  supplies  IAW  Home  Station  Medical  Response allowance  standards  and  MAJCOM  guidance,  or  plan  for  rapid  resupply  of  vaccines, prophylaxis,  antivirals,  and  other  essential  supplies/equipment to  support  medical intervention. 2.13.  Mortuary  Affairs.  Special  precautions  must  be  taken  to  ensure  personnel  handling remains  are  adequately  protected  and  can  perform  their  mission  safely.  Many  contaminated remains  can  be  packaged  appropriately  and  handlers  can  wear  simple  protective  ensembles  to ensure their safety from  blood and body fluids. Current procedural  guidelines discuss means of decontaminating  exterior  surfaces  to  reduce  the  hazards  as  much  as  possible.  However,  due  to the  lack  of  published  standards  and  possible  internalized  hazard,  human  remains  cannot  be certified as "safe" at this time. 2.13.1.  Review tactics, techniques,  and procedures for the  identification and segregation of CHR. 2.13.2.  Air  Force  guidance  for  the  handling  of  CHR  is  outlined  in  AFI  34-242.  This  AFI, which  is  derived  from  JP  4-06,  provides  guidance  for  mortuary  affairs  in  contingency operations and the prescribed processes for mortuary collection points, temporary storage or interment, and handling CHR.  2.13.3.  Transportation of CHR, including air transportation within CONUS and repatriation from OCONUS, may require approval from SecDef or higher authorities. 2.13.4.  Relationships between the installation and local community medical examiner should be  established  prior  to  a  public  health  emergency  or  disease  of  operational  significance. Roles and responsibilities should be clarified, as appropriate. 2.14.  Transportation.  Implementation  of  installation  disease  containment  guidance  will  pose unique  transportation  requirements,  especially  to  move  personnel  and  supplies  within  the installation and to transport specimens and samples off the installation. Further, because of ROM measures and the potential to contaminate vehicles when transporting contagious passengers, it is important to develop transportation plans in advance and to dedicate specific vehicles for unique transportation requirements as needed. 2.14.1.  Personnel  movement  plans  should  address  normal  base  mission  requirements  with social  distancing/FHP  restrictions.  They  should  also  ensure  safe  movement  of  personnel between supporting and supported facilities (e.g., SFS-augmentees guard mount location and mass prophylaxis area, MTF and isolation facilities). 2.14.2.  Material  movement  plans  should  be  developed  for  transportation  of  contaminated waste  and  specimens/samples  to  off-site  laboratories.  Ensure  plans  detail  chain-of-custody requirements. 2.14.3.  Transportation plans should include guidelines on the level of approval necessary for transport  of  particular  items  (e.g.,  transport  of  CHR  and/or  contaminated/contagious casualties may require approval from SecDef or higher authorities). 2.14.4.  Develop  transportation  plans  to  reduce  traffic/parking  congestion  around  mass prophylaxis sites. 2.15.  Legal Considerations.  Responding to and containing a biological incident requires some legal  actions  that  differ  from  standard  incident  response  and  should  be  accounted  for  in  pre-AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 23 incident  planning.  Support  by  active  duty  military  units  and  personnel  to  civilian  law enforcement agencies is limited by the Posse Comitatus Act. Active duty military members are generally not permitted to perform any law enforcement functions off military installations, even if conducted in conjunction with or at the request of civilian law enforcement. This prohibition does  not  apply  to  ANG  units  and  personnel  serving  in  state  active  duty,  and  may  not  apply  to Title  32  status.  Commanders  should  consult  with  their  servicing  legal  office  for  advice  on  any support  requests  from  civilian  law  enforcement  or  when  conducting  any  operations  off  of  a military installation. 2.15.1.  See  AFI  31-115,  Security  Forces  Investigations  Program,  and  consult  with  local Security Forces for guidance on crime scene security and processing. 2.15.2.  Identify  and  review  statutes  and  other  regulatory  provisions  that  may  impact  the ability to enforce ROM and respond to civilian authorities during a public health emergency or an outbreak of a disease of operational significance. Commanders must be advised of their legal  options  to  manage  assigned  installation  personnel,  including  military  personnel,  DOD civilians,  contractors,  dependents,  HN/third  country  personnel,  coalition/allied  forces,  and other  personnel  that  may  be  on  or  off  the  installation  (T-1).  Refer  to  AFI  10-2519  for additional guidance.  2.16.  Mutual  Aid  or  Host  Nation  Resources.  The installation should analyze what resources are  made  available  under  support  agreements  with  local  communities  and/or  HNs.  An installation can augment its resources through cooperation with local or regional agencies, other Air  Force  and  DOD  resources,  or  the  HN.  These  additional  support  elements  might  include emergency  medical  services,  public  health  offices,  law  enforcement  agencies,  environmental agencies,  communications  capabilities, laboratory  facilities  for confirmative analysis, and contracted response and remediation companies. transportation  support, 2.17.  OCONUS Installations.  HN ownership and control of overseas installations may prevent commanders from unilaterally implementing many of the provisions of this manual. Ultimately, U.S. prerogatives and control at overseas locations may require adjustment to accommodate the sovereign  interests  of  the  HN,  except  as  otherwise  defined  in  applicable  international agreements, such as SOFA, defense cooperation agreements, and base rights agreements. 2.18.  Manpower  and  Augmentation.  Mission-nonessential  manpower  and  designated augmentation forces may need to be reallocated to support the anticipated additional burden on certain functional communities such as medical/public health, force support, and security forces. Whenever  feasible,  pre-identify  and  train  augmentation  forces  to  ensure  they  are  prepared  to support in the event of a public health emergency or disease of operational significance. 2.19.  Medical  Surveillance.  Medical  surveillance  is  the  ongoing,  systematic  collection  of health  data  to  trigger  early  implementation  of  FHP  practices.  Effective  surveillance,  when coordinated with local public health efforts (e.g., county, state, and HN) can identify a biological outbreak. Preparatory actions include: 2.19.1.  Reviewing local/regional disease trends. 2.19.2.  Establishing a medical baseline for diseases endemic to your AOR. 2.19.3.  Regularly monitoring disease surveillance reporting mechanisms for the installation and/or community. 24 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 2.19.4.  Developing plans and procedures to conduct rapid, widespread contact tracing and/or epidemiological investigations. Contact tracing and epidemiological investigation allows the correct portion of the population to be identified for prophylaxis and/or treatment. 2.19.5.  Effective surveillance must be coupled with timely dissemination of actionable data to higher authorities, both military and civilian. 2.20.  Public  Health  Emergency.  Upon  declaration  of  a  public  health  emergency  by  the Installation  Commander  and  the  implementation  of  ROM  IAW  AFI  10-2519,  the  Installation Commander  must  establish  rules  enforcing  ROM  measures  and  should  consider  the  following (T-1): 2.20.1.  Use  the  minimum  force  necessary  to  restrain  personnel  from  unauthorized  entry  or departure from a quarantine area and for enforcing ROM IAW AFI 31-118, Security Forces Standards and Procedures. Those individuals or groups not subject to military law and who refuse  to  obey  or  otherwise  violate  an  order  under  this  manual  may  be  detained  by  the military commander until appropriate civil authorities can respond. The military commander shall  coordinate  with  civil  authorities  to  ensure  the  response  is  appropriate  for  the  public health emergency. (T-1) See AFI 10-2519 for further guidance.  2.20.2.  Planning should take into account local, state, federal, and any applicable HN laws as well as international agreements and SOFAs. Commanders of installations in foreign nations may not have the authority to order quarantine or other ROM of non-U.S. military personnel due  to  HN  sovereignty  and  jurisdiction  over  the  installation.  In  these  cases,  immediate consultation with the servicing legal office and local authorities to request they impose ROM is  necessary  to  protect  U.S.  military  personnel,  civilians  accompanying  the  force,  and  HN personnel. 2.21.  PI&ID Operational Phases.  There will not be a single phase for DOD execution during a PI&ID  incident.  Through  the  GCP  PI&ID  3551-13,  the  DOD  has  defined  six  operational phases—Prepare,  Protect,  Mitigate,  Respond,  Stabilize,  and  Transition  and  Recovery  (See Figure 2.1). Each GCC will determine the operational phase of its AOR based on AOR-specific data,  in  coordination  with  the  Joint  Staff  and  OSD,  and  upon  approval  of  the  SecDef.  Moving from  phase  to  phase  will  be  accomplished  based  on  specific  indicators  and  will  imply expenditure of resources and obligating capabilities, as determined in GCC regional plans. AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 25 Figure 2.1.  Six-Phase Model.  2.21.1.  Phase  0  —  Prepare.  DOD  develops  synchronized  plans  for  PI&ID,  and  integrates planning  efforts  with  the  interagency  community  and  partner  nations.  DOD  conducts integrated Security Cooperation and Partnership Activities (SCPA) to better prepare partner nations  to  detect,  report,  and  respond  to  PI&ID  outbreaks.  Activities  executed  during  this phase  are  considered  steady-state  operations  and  will  be  executed  as  part  of  GCCs  Theater Campaign Plans, and supported by Services and Selected Defense Agencies. These activities will continue through all phases. 2.21.2.  Phase  1  —  Protect.  Upon  identification  of  a  potential  or  actual  disease  outbreak  of operational  significance,  DOD  takes  decisive  action  to  protect  DOD  forces  from  becoming infected.  The  focus  is  the  protection  of  U.S.  Forces,  DOD  civilians,  and  DOD  contractors performing  critical  roles,  dependents  and  beneficiaries,  as  well  as  the  associated  resources necessary  to  maintain  readiness.  Additionally,  DOD  will  work  with  the  interagency  and partner  nations,  to  ensure  DOD  freedom  of  movement,  and  to  coordinate  communication strategies. 2.21.3.  Phase  2  —  Mitigate.  DOD  will  mitigate  the  effects  of  an  operationally  significant disease outbreak on mission assurance and its forces. The focus of this phase is the protection of MEFs. Additionally, DOD will continue to work with the interagency and partner nations, to ensure DOD freedom of movement, and to coordinate communication strategies. 2.21.4.  Phase  3  —  Respond.  DOD  will  provide  assistance  to  civil  authorities  (domestic and/or  international).  The  focus  of  this  phase  is  providing  support  to  civil  authorities. Additionally, DOD will continue to work with the interagency and partner nations, to ensure DOD freedom of movement, and to coordinate communication strategies. 2.21.5.  Phase  4  —  Stabilize.  DOD  will  complete  requests  for  assistance  and  scale  down response operations when military and civil authorities (domestic and/or international) decide appropriate.  The  focus  of  this  phase  is  completion  of  assistance  and  preparation  for transition. 2.21.6.  Phase  5  —  Transition  and  Recover.  DOD  will  redeploy  remaining  civil  support response  forces,  reconstitute  the  force,  and  make  any  preparations  required  for  follow-on 26 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 waves  of  the  pandemic.  The  focus  of  this  phase  is  transition  from  civil  support  operations, reconstitution of the force, and preparing for subsequent pandemic waves. AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 27 Chapter 3 CONTENT FOR INSTALLATION DISEASE CONTAINMENT GUIDANCE 3.1.  General.  As  directed  by  AFI  10-2519,  installations  must  develop  disease  containment guidance  either  as  a  stand-alone  DCP  or  incorporated  in  the  IEMP  10-2  that  allows  the installation to effectively prepare for, respond to, and recover from public health emergencies or diseases  of  operational  significance.  (T-0,  DOD  GCP  PI&ID  3551-13)  This  chapter  outlines content to ensure the installation plan developed provides detailed procedures, information, and guidance to protect installation personnel and critical resources. Installation disease containment guidance supports sustainment of critical mission operations during public health emergencies or diseases  of  operational  significance.  The  plan  should  be  maintained  in  an  executable  state  and updated  during  routine  updates  to  the  IEMP  10-2  or  the  MCRP,  or  sooner  as  threats  to  the installation  change.  When  available,  lessons  learned  from  exercises  and  real-world  incidents should be incorporated into the plan. 3.2.  Plan Components.  AFMAN 10-401 Volume 2, Planning Formats and Guidance, specifies components to a plan, but only three are necessary for disease containment guidance: the table of contents, the basic plan, and the attachments (annexes, appendices, and/or tabs). 3.3.  The Basic Plan.  It is recommended disease containment guidance follow the format below. However,  the  plan  is  required  to  contain,  at  a  minimum,  the  following  nine  content  areas: references,  tasked  organizations,  situation,  threat,  key  assumptions,  mission,  execution, administration and logistics, and C2. (T-0, DOD GCP PI&ID 3551-13) Installation planners may use discretion in the ordering of information and may add additional information as required. If developing  a  stand-alone  DCP,  keep  the  basic  plan  brief,  incorporating  detailed  information within the annexes. Where applicable, reference other installation plans (e.g., Integrated Defense Plan (IDP), IEMP 10-2, or MCRP) rather than restating the information. 3.3.1.  References.  Attachment  1  lists  applicable  DOD,  Joint,  and  Air  Force  guidance  for executing  disease  containment  guidance.  Include  installation-specific  guidance,  as  well  as any additional references required to execute the installation plan. (T-1) 3.3.2.  Tasked Organizations. Identify installation-assigned or -attached organizations tasked to support the plan including tenants, GSUs, joint and coalition forces, and others supported or tasked as a result of the guidance. (T-1) 3.3.2.1.  Supporting  Forces.  Identify  military  units  or  organizations  outside installation that support this plan. (T-1) the 3.3.2.2.  Supporting  Organizations.  Identify  non-military  organizations  identified  for support via MOA or MAA. (T-1) 3.3.3.  Situation. Describe the most probable conditions for implementing this plan. Identify other plans that are likely to be implemented concurrently with this plan. (T-1) 3.3.4.  Threat.  Identify  the  biological  threat(s)  to  the  installation.  Consider  enemy  and terrorist use of biological agents, as well as naturally-occurring outbreaks. Ensure a focus on endemic diseases that could be of operational concern due to contagiousness, high mortality, etc.  Note:  This  portion  of  the  plan  may  be  classified;  if  it  does,  indicate  the  security precedence and handle IAW proper procedures. (T-1) 28 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 3.3.5.  Key Assumptions. Outline major planning assumptions used in plan development. (T-1) 3.3.6.  Mission. Outline the purpose and goals  of installation disease containment guidance. Ensure the mission is synchronized with DOD GCP PI&ID and other applicable HHQ plans including AOR plans and GCC/Air Force component campaign plans. Include the mission of the  installation  and  identify  critical  missions  that  must  continue  during  a  public  health emergency  or  disease  of  operational  significance.  (T-1)  Address  the  likelihood  and circumstances that may require the installation to support sustainment of mission operations during an outbreak. (T-1) If assigned, attached, or transitioning forces must sustain mission operations, address their impacts in the plan. (T-1) 3.3.7.  Execution.  Identify  the  authority  to  execute  the  plan  and  the  general  process  for implementation during steady-state (Phase 0) and contingency operations (Phases 1-5). (T-1) Highlight  the  major  tasks  each  installation  organization  and/or  functional  community  must perform to carry out the plan. (T-1) 3.3.7.1.  Concept of Operations. Describe in general terms the process the installation will follow to prepare for and respond to a public health emergency or disease of operational significance  (e.g.,  Develop  an  integrated  PI&ID  planning  document,  train  the  force, exercise  the  plan,  and  make  modifications  as  necessary  to  keep  the  plan  current  and viable. (T-1) Ensure the DOD six-phase construct is followed throughout all steps of the process, See Figure 2.1). (T-1) 3.3.7.2.  Desired  Effects  Priority  List.  Identify  and  outline  a  prioritized  list  of  desired effects to achieve installation objectives. (T-1) 3.3.7.3.  Limiting Factors. Identify factors that may significantly impact execution of the plan. Specify how often limiting factors (LIMFAC) will be reviewed and updated. (T-1) Note: Ensure inclusion of LIMFAC does not elevate the classification of the plan beyond For Official Use Only (FOUO); or if it does, indicate the security precedence and handle IAW proper procedures. (T-1) 3.3.8.  Administration  and  Logistics.  Identify  how  key  installation  organizations  are  to  be supported and what support they must provide for themselves, or to others. In general terms, outline the sources for equipment and supplies required for execution and sustainment. (T-1) Address  organic  resources,  those  available  via  MOAs/MAAs  and  those  available  via  other means  (e.g.,  Time-Phased  Force  and  Deployment  Data).  (T-1)  Additionally,  identify  local support  conditions  that  adversely  affect  plan  implementation.  (T-1)  Resources  required  for plan execution but not currently available should be identified as LIMFAC (See Paragraph  3.3.5.3).  3.3.9.  Command and Control. Identify command relationships both internal and external to the installation. (T-1) 3.3.9.1.  List  installation  control  centers  used  in  the  plan  along  with  the  individual  or organization responsible for their operation. (T-1) Note: Ensure inclusion of installation control centers does not elevate the classification of the plan beyond FOUO; or if it does, indicate the security precedence and handle IAW proper procedures.  AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 29 3.3.9.2.  Consult  installation  COOP  plan  to  understand  alternate  locations  for  critical missions,  command  succession  plans,  delegations  of  authority,  and  other  provisions required for continuity of command. (T-1) 3.3.9.3.  Outline methods of communications to be used. (T-1) 3.4.  Annexes.  Disease  containment  guidance  will  include,  at  a  minimum,  the  following content.  Installation  planners  may  add  additional  annexes/appendices  as  required.  (T-1) Where  applicable,  annexes  may  reference  other  installation  plans  (e.g.,  IDP,  IEMP  10-2,  and MCRP) rather than restate the information. The following paragraphs outline proposed areas of focus for each annex/content area. 3.4.1.  Annex A – Task Organization. This section should: 3.4.1.1.  List  all  major  elements  directly  subordinate  to  the  headquarters  including components  and  major  subordinates,  augmentation  and  supporting  commands,  and reserve component forces. 3.4.1.2.  Outline the identified C2 structure. 3.4.1.3.  Identify  tasks  that  will  be  completed  by  an  organization  outside  of  the installation (e.g., HN, subordinate command). 3.4.2.  Annex  B  –  Intelligence.  This  section  should  identify  the  Commander’s  Critical Information  Requirements  (CCIR)  during  a  public  health  emergency  or  disease  of operational significance. 3.4.3.  Annex C – Operations. This section should: 3.4.3.1.  Identify the specific functions critical to operations when the installation is faced with a public health emergency or disease of operational significance. 3.4.3.2.  Understand the processes to MEFs and services for a sustained period of six to eight  weeks  due  to  a  public  health  emergency  or  disease  of  operational  significance. Consider  all  tenant  organizations’  needs  to  make  the  return  to  normal  operations  as smooth  as  possible,  and  to  prepare  for  further  waves  of  the  disease.  Coordinate  disease containment  guidance  with  the  installation  COOP  Plan.  Limit  redundancy  between  the two  documents,  but  ensure  references  to  each  accurately  reflect  what  is  codified  in  the other. 3.4.3.3.  Identify  potential  2nd-  and  3rd-order  impacts  of  a  public  health  emergency  or disease  of  operational  significance  on  the  installation’s  ability  to  sustain  operations, maintain  installation  support  requirements,  and  provide  FHP  to  the  key  population. Outline the installation’s plan to mitigate these effects. 3.4.3.4.  Establish overarching objectives and effects (to include key tasks and execution triggers by phase) for each response phase consistent  with  the DOD GCP PI&ID 3551-13. Ensure these take into account the CCIR. 3.4.3.5.  Identify  detection,  sampling,  and  identification  resources  available  on  the installation, as well as resources available through MOAs/MAAs. Identify vulnerabilities in the detection and identification capabilities based on the installation-specific threat.  30 AFMAN10-2608  13 NOVEMBER 2015 3.4.3.6.  Identify steps to enhance bio-surveillance in response to an intelligence warning or actual incident.  Tailor procedures for detector  operations modes and sampling tempo IAW  the  force  protection  condition  (FPCON),  health  protection  condition  (HPCON), trigger event, or the causative agent/disease. 3.4.3.7.  Address  individual  protective  equipment  (IPE)  and  PPE  requirements  and  the distribution plan for the installation. Follow guidance provided by the CDC on utilization of face masks and respirators. Consider prioritization of resources (e.g., organizations and functions, HN personnel) and unique requirements for transient forces. 3.4.3.8.  Outline the methodology to be used when determining the appropriate shelter-in-place  measures  applicable  to  the  public  health  emergency  or  disease  of  operational significance.  Identify  organizations  tasked  to  support  shelter  operations,  including  roles and responsibilities, resources required, etc. 3.4.3.9.  Outline procedures for conducting an investigation when the disease outbreak is suspected to be the result of a terrorist attack. Consult Office of Special Investigations for crime scene management and chain-of-custody requirements. 3.4.3.10.  Consider possible FPCON/HPCON adjustments based on biological threats or incidents.  Include  procedures  to  report  cases  where  the  implementation  of  specific  FP measures  will  adversely  impact  or  significantly  hamper  accomplishment  of  assigned duties. 3.4.3.11.  Identify the procedures that will be used to secure and control access into and out of quarantine/isolation facilities. Outline Rules for the Use of Force for enforcement of security requirements during response to biological incidents. 3.4.3.12.  Specify  procedures  that  will  be  used  to  provide  security  for  transfer  of laboratory  samples/specimens,  arrival  of  assets  on  the  installation,  and  mass  dispensing (i.e., Point of Dispensing) operations. 3.4.3.13.  Identify  anticipated  installation-specific  application  of  ROM  (i.e.,  identify facilities  for  quarantine  and  isolation  operations,  lock  down  the  installation  and  allow individuals  to  move  freely  within  the  fence,  sector  the  installation  and  limit  movement between sectors, HN limitations/restrictions). 3.4.3.13.1.  Describe  enforcement  measures  to  be  used  for  each  type  of  ROM  (e.g., social distancing will be self-monitored and isolation/quarantine will be monitored by designated individuals). 3.4.3.13.2.
