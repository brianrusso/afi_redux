The purposes of the 4H0X1 Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) are to enhance the on-the-job training experience for Cardiopulmonary Laboratory personnel. The QTPs provide trainers teaching steps for each of the essential core tasks.  The steps will help to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance.  QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification officials to evaluate performance.    2.  Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS in Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills required for all 4H0X1 personnel. You have flexibility to complete the competencies in your desired order.  3.  Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review each module with the relevant reference materials. Inform the trainee that all questions should be brought to the attention of the trainer. Provide a step-by-step demonstration for the trainee. After the demonstration, allow the trainee to perform the competency (with guidance).  Remember—the objective of each QTP is to standardize training. The goal is to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance. 4.  When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation  instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee  successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in AFTR. 5.  The  QTP  task  completion  is  to  be  annotated  on  AF  Form  1098,  Special  Task Certification and Recurring  Training, in AFTR.  NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s AFTR.  6. If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback  concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are  satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, re-evaluate the trainee until the objective is met.  If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task 7. certifier/certifying official, the  trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance.  8.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such standardization will  benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for  assessing/certifying the Cardiopulmonary Laboratory Technician each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty  position and are the minimally required skill to receive 5-level certification. Additional, duty-station specific competencies may be required in conjunction with the QTP package in order to be awarded 5        the 5-skill level. All site-specific competencies must be reviewed and approved by the MAJCOM Functional prior to use. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Cardiopulmonary Laboratory personnel. We value first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback.
