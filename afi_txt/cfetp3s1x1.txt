This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources, and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and will instill rigor in all aspects of career field training.  This CFETP provides all EO personnel (Active Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard (ANG)) a clear career path. Civilian employees occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.  The CFETP consists of two parts; both parts of the plan are used by supervisors to plan, manage, and control training within the career field. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); Section D indicates resource constraints such as funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following:  Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, technical references to support training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements; Section B contains the course objective list and training standards which supervisors will use to determine if airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials; Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; Section E identifies MAJCOM unique requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan, and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan.  NOTE:  Due to the limited staffing in each base program office, the trainer may also act in the capacity as task certifier. 3.  Using guidance provided in the CFETP will ensure individuals in this specialty receive effective and efficient training at the appropriate point in their career.  This plan will enable us to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. 4         ABBREVIATIONS and TERMS EXPLAINED Advanced Training (AT): A formal course which provides individuals who are qualified in one or more positions of their Air Force Specialty (AFS) with additional skills/knowledge to enhance their expertise in the career field.  Training is for selected career airmen at the advanced level of the AFS. Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL):  ADL is an evolution of distributed learning (distance learning) that emphasizes collaboration on standards-based versions of reusable objects, networks, and learning management systems, yet may include some legacy methods and media.

This CFETP provides information necessary for AFCFMs, MFMs, commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient  career field training program.  This plan outlines the training individuals in this AFS should receive in  order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This plan identifies initial skills, upgrade,  qualification, advanced, and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the 3-skill level awarding AFS  specific training an individual receives upon retraining into the Equal Opportunity Specialty through  successful completion of the formal DEOMI Equal Opportunity Advisor Course (EAOC) at Patrick  AFB, FL. Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and  correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 7- and 9-skill levels.  Qualification  training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify a trainee in a specific duty  position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  The training  program is designed to provide the performance skills/knowledge required on the job.  Advanced  training is formal specialty training used to increase proficiency of selected airmen.  Proficiency training  is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training  provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes including:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual's career.          2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and  proficiency requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training, contract  training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM-developed training to support this AFSC must be identified  for inclusion in the plan as listed in the CFETP Part II. 2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list  of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM is the CFETP approval authority.  MAJCOM Strategic  Advisors will identify and coordinate with the AFCFM on career field training requirements.  The  AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  Using the  courses listed in the CFETP Part II, duplicate training will be eliminated.

The EO training cycle is different from most other specialties due to being a lateral career field.  In addition to retraining personnel in from different year groups, recruiting and retraining within different grades compound the challenge of charting a by-year/by-grade progression in this specialty.  The above chart is provided only as an overview of a typical training cycle with consideration for EO‟s uniqueness. 8.4.  Core tasks identified in the STS are intended to ensure the technician has an overarching understanding of the core competencies outlined above and throughout the STS.  In doing so, a task from each area is identified which best exemplifies that particular competency.  Like previous core task documentation requirements, once certified during upgrade training, supervisors are required to readdress these items as an individual’s duty position and responsibilities change.  For upgrade training requirements, the supervisor will determine proficiency of each task for certification.  That determination should be documented appropriately in the individuals training record. Section C - Skill Level Training Requirements 9.  Purpose.  Skill level training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for each skill level in broad, general terms and establishes the mandatory requirements for entry, award and retention of each skill level.  The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS at Part II, Sections A and B of this CFETP. 18            10.  Specialty Qualification Requirements: 10.1.

OPR/Target Completion Date.  AFPC/EO/FY16 Section E.  Transitional Training Guide 15.  There are currently no transition training requirements.  This area is reserved. Part II Section A - Specialty Training Standard 1.  Implementation.  This STS will be used for training provided by DEOMI for 3-level classes entering EAOC 15-2 for course and for 7-level enrollment in CDC 3S171.  Effective July 2015 this STS will also  be used to identify 7-level upgrade training requirements. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS: 2.1.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for airmen to perform duties in the 3- and 7-skill level.  Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements. 2.2.  Provides certification for OJT.  Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification/completed date. 2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  See CADRE/AFSC/CDC listing maintained by the unit-training manager for current CDC listings. 2.4.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.5.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for on-the-job training when placed in AF Form 623, Individual Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply: 22               2.5.1.  Documentation. Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201. Air Force Training records (AFTR) is mandatory for documenting training and attachments one and two of this CFETP must be used.  Use of attachment three is optional. 2.5.1.1.  Certification Procedures.  This STS is the primary source document for recording task certifications.  Core tasks are identified by skill level through the U&TW process.  These core tasks are the minimum qualification requirements for position qualification or skill level upgrade. 2.5.1.2.  Position Qualification.  Supervisors may defer core tasks for unique duty position qualification or task is not performed.  Deferred core tasks must be identified in the unit’s JQS master training plan. Supervisors evaluate the need to train core tasks for position qualification each time an individual is assigned to a new duty position or duty location. 2.5.1.3  Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP.  All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory. Use of AFTR to identify and certify all past and current qualifications is mandatory. Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201. 2.5.1.4.  Decertification and Recertification.  When a trainee is found to be unqualified on a task previously certified for his or her position, the supervisor deletes the previous certification date in AFTR.  Appropriate remarks are entered on the AF Form 623A, On-The-Job Training Record Continuation Sheet, as to the reason for decertification.  The individual is recertified (if required) using new training dates.  For certification/decertification documentation reference AFI 36-2201.  For CDC course exam failures refer to AFI 36-2201. 2.5.2.  Training Standard. 2.5.2.1.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures. 2.5.2.2.  The training standard is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC) .  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, Air Force  Military Personnel Testing System, Chapter 1.  WAPS is not applicable to the AFG or AFR. 23         3.  Recommendations.
