Aircrew training is designed to progress the unqualified crewmember from  formal Qualification  Training (QT), Transition  Training (TX) or Requalification Training (RQ), to Continuation Training (CT), and finally to Upgrade Training (UGT). 1.4.1.  Qualification  Training.  (T-2)  QT,  TX,  RQ  and  UGT  provide  training  necessary  to initially qualify aircrew in a basic position and flying duties without regard to a specific unit or  squadron  mission.    Upon  completion  of  QT,  TX,  RQ  or  UGT  the  crew  member  attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. 1.4.1.1.  BAQ  aircrew  members  have  completed  a  flight  evaluation  and  are  qualified  to perform basic aircrew duties in the E-8. 1.4.1.1.1.  Aircrew members will maintain BAQ status until certified Combat Mission Ready (CMR) or Basic Mission Capable (BMC) by Squadron/CC. 8 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 1.4.1.1.2.  Squadron  CC/DOs  will  carefully  choose  those  missions  on  which  BAQ aircrew may fly unsupervised. 1.4.1.1.3.  BAQ  aircrew  will  only  perform  those  duties  for  which  they  have  been trained and qualified.  With appropriate supervision, BAQ aircrew may participate in composite force or other advanced scenarios. 1.4.1.1.4.  Except for senior officers, O-6 selects and higher, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status. Aircrew other than senior officers holding BAQ status for over 6 months  will  require  a  waiver  from  MAJCOM/A3  or  must  re-accomplish  an evaluation (T-2). 1.4.1.1.5.  CMR or BMC certification transitions the member into the CT. 1.4.2.  Continuation Training (CT). (T-2)  CT is designed to focus training on capabilities and  skills  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit’s  core  tasked  missions.    Levels  and  amount  of  CT varies  within  BMC  and  CMR  RAP  qualification levels  depending  on  member’s experienced/inexperienced designation.  Experience level and MR status is assigned to each crewmember  by  the  gaining  flying  squadron  commander.    Specific  RAP  instructions  are issued by a RAP Tasking Memorandum. 1.4.3.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP).  RAP is the ACC CT program designed to focus on capabilities  needed  to  accomplish  a  unit's  primary  DOC  statement  missions.    Following completion of QT/TX/RQ/UGT, units will assign aircrew members to either a CMR position or  a  BMC  position.    (T-2).    CMR  aircrew  will  maintain  combat  readiness,  while  BMC aircrew  may  require  additional  training  prior  to  combat.    As  Lead  Command,  ACC  will publish  a  RTM  to  establish  CT  requirements.  Post  the  current  RTM  following  this instruction. 1.4.3.1.  CMR.  CMR establishes the minimum training required for aircrew members to qualify  and  remain  proficient  in  all  of  the  primary  DOC  statement  missions  tasked  to their assigned or attached unit and weapon system.  Designate and maintain CMR aircrew as follows: 1.4.3.1.1.  All  designated  combat  aircraft  (CC-coded)  unit  active  component  API-1, Squadron  Commander  (SQ/CC),  and  Squadron  Director  of  Operations  (SQ/DO) positions  are  designated  as  CMR  positions.    OG/CCs  may  designate  other  API-6 positions not  assigned to  the flying squadron  as  CMR.   Exception If  a unit is  over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of their Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1s to CMR and designate the overage BMC.  In this case, priority should be  given  to  inexperienced  aircrew  members  with  at  least  50  percent,  if  available, designated CMR. 1.4.3.1.2.  CMR  aircrew  members  maintain  proficiency  and  qualification  in  all primary missions of the flying unit to which they are assigned or attached.  Failure to complete  CMR  training  or  maintain  designated  currencies  results  in  regression  to non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. (T-2).  1.4.3.2.  BMC.    BMC  establishes  the  minimum  training  required  for  aircrew  to  be familiar  with  all  (possibly  qualified  and  proficient  in  some)  of  the  primary  DOC AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 9 statement  mission  requirements  of  their  assigned  or  attached  unit  and  weapons  system.  Designate and maintain BMC as follows: 1.4.3.2.1.  Non-CMR aircrew positions above squadron level are normally designated BMC.    BMC  designations  are  assigned  to  aircrew  whose  primary  job  performing wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying operation. 1.4.3.2.2.  BMC aircrew members will maintain familiarization with all unit primary missions.    They  may  also  train  for  proficiency  and  qualification  in  some  of  those missions.    For  those  missions  in  which  they  maintain  familiarization  only,  BMC aircrew must be able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30 days or less.  (T-2)  BMC  aircrew  should  accomplish  all  mission-related  ground  training  designated  by their attached SQ/CC. 1.4.3.3.  API-6/8/C/D  rated  personnel  flying  authorizations,  Career  Enlisted  Aviator (CEA)  flying  authorizations,  nonrated  MAJCOM  Realistic  Training  Program  aircrew, USAFWS  assigned  instructors,  and  test  aircrew  are  managed  IAW  AFI  11-202V1  and MAJCOM guidance. 1.4.3.3.1.  These aircrew members will maintain BMC status IAW AFI 11-202V1 and ACC  RAP  tasking  memorandum;  however,  they  are  not  required  to  complete  BMC specific  ATD  events.    Additionally,  these  aircrew  members  are  exempt  from academic  ground  training,  chemical  warfare  (CW)  training,  and  special  training programs (except when required in preparation for theater deployment). 1.4.3.4.  Unqualified  (UQ)  aircrew  members  are  not  authorized  to  perform  any  flight duties  unless  under  instructor/evaluator  supervision.   UQ  aircrew  members  are specifically defined as any member who is: 1.4.3.4.1.  Enrolled in E-8C Qualification Training (E-8C IQT/TX/RQ). 1.4.3.4.1.1.  Qualified and CMR aircrew in upgrade training will not be made UQ or NCMR in their presently qualified crew position. Example:  If an AWO enters training as an SD and is otherwise qualified, current and CMR as an AWO, this person would maintain that status until he or she completes an SD Qual/Mission Evaluation,  becomes  NCMR,  UQ  for  reasons  as  outlined  in  AFI  11-202  Vol  1, fails RAP lookback or expiration of AWO checkride. 1.4.3.4.1.2.  Events  accomplished  in  UGT  may  update  currencies  in  currently qualified position, but are normally not creditable as RAP events.  Exception  If a member must fly a CT sortie during training, or is becoming dual qualified, RAP events that the member is currently qualified to perform may be credited as long as they log in on the flight orders in their currently qualified crew position. 1.4.3.4.2.  Downgraded for being non-current more than 6 months IAW Table 4.4. 1.4.3.4.3.  Downgraded for a demonstrated lack of ability. 1.4.3.4.4.  Downgraded for failure to meet standards during a flight evaluation. 1.4.4.  RAP  Policy  and  Management.  RAP  mission  readiness  and  experience  levels  are defined by a total number of RAP missions, broken down into training events, plus specific 10 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 qualifications and associated events  as determined by the MAJCOM and unit commanders.  Further details are provided in Chapter 4 and the RTM. 1.4.4.1.  An  effective  RAP  training  sortie  requires  accomplishing  a  tactical  mission profile or a building block type sortie.  The breakout of events provided in the RTM is the minimum amount of training required to maintain proficiency. 1.4.4.2.  Progression from BMC to CMR first requires: 1.4.4.2.1.  Satisfactory 1-month lookback at applicable CMR rate. 1.4.4.2.2.  Completion  of  mission-related  ground  training  and  verification  of  that training. 1.4.4.2.3.  SQ/CC certification. 1.4.5.  RAP Training Sortie Program Development.  (T-2). 1.4.5.1.  RAP  sortie  and  event  requirements  as  listed  in  the  RTM  apply  to  CMR/BMC aircrew,  as  well  as  those  carrying  special  capabilities  or  qualifications.    The  sortie requirements  in  the  ACC  RTM  establish  the  minimum  number  of  sorties  per  training cycle for CMR/BMC levels of training. 1.4.5.2.  Experience building and collateral sortie requirements must be considered when developing RAP training and unit flying hour programs. 1.4.5.3.  Experience  building  sorties  are  additional  training  sorties  necessary  to  achieve desired proficiency in optimum time.  RAP missions may not provide sufficient hours to experience aircrew to achieve overall unit experience levels.  Paragraph 1.4.6 provides the definition for an experienced aircrew. 1.4.6.  Experience Levels.  Aircrew experience levels tell unit commanders how much flying and simulator training is needed to meet RAP levels.  Squadron Commanders are responsible to  designate  crew  members  as  experienced/inexperienced.    Table  1.1  shall  be  used  as  a guideline  for  experience  level.    However,  squadron  commanders  must  also  consider  an aircrew  member’s as experienced/inexperienced. expertise  when designating ability, proficiency and 1.4.6.1.  Inexperienced  designations  identify  aircrew  members  who  require  prescribed levels of exposure to flying and/or mission events to maintain BMC/CMR status. 1.4.6.2.  Experienced  designations  identify  aircrew  members  who  have  demonstrated increased  proficiency  and  airmanship  and  therefore  require  less  training  to  maintain satisfactory  performance.    Aircrew  members  who  are  nominated  for  Instructor  or Positional  Upgrade  must  have  been  designated  as  experienced  by  the  SQ/CC.  Exception: Copilots may be inexperienced prior to upgrade to AC. AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 11 Table 1.1.  Experience Level Guidelines (See para 1.4.6). 1.5.  Training  Concepts  and  Policies  (T-2).  The  aircrew  training  cycle  is  12  months.    Units will  complete  training  requirements  during  the  appropriate  training  cycle  except  where specifically exempt.  The ACC RAP tasking memorandum may be used to tailor specific training events,  frequencies,  currencies,  and  rules  for  crediting  training  events.    ACC  RAP  tasking memorandum may not be less restrictive or deviate from training concepts and policies outlined in this instruction.  1.5.1.  OSS/OST  should  collect  specific  inputs  from  operational  squadrons,  OG/OGV,  and OSS/OSK  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  the  QT/UGT  training  and  evaluation  trends necessary  to  develop  continuation  training  or  recommend  changes  to  applicable  syllabi  as required.  Note: The Formal Training Unit (FTU) will interface directly with ACC Training Support  Squadron  (TRSS)  Detachment  7.    OSS/OST  will  participate  in  all  syllabus  review conferences. 1.5.2.  Training  missions  will  be  designed  to  achieve  combat  capability  in  squadron  tasked roles, maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety.  RAP training missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations  based  on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition capabilities.  Use procedures and actions applicable to combat scenarios (i.e. appropriate use of code words, authentication procedures, combat  tactics, safe  recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions, intelligence briefing and debriefing). 1.5.3.  In-flight Supervision. 1.5.3.1.  The following must be under the direct supervision of an instructor/evaluator or an OG approved supervisor (See Paragraph 1.5.3.1.2). 1.5.3.1.1.  Non-current aircrew.  Note: Instructor Pilots are required to supervise the update of expired pilot currencies as required in AFI 11-202V3, General Flight Rules. 12 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 1.5.3.1.2.  OG approved supervisor.  In the rare cases when an instructor/evaluator is unavailable, a supervisor from the same crew position may be used with in-title OG approval. 1.5.3.2.  The  following  personnel  will  fly  with  an  instructor/evaluator  of  same  crew position. 1.5.3.2.1.  Unqualified (UQ). 1.5.3.2.2.  Any senior officer who has not completed QT requirements of Chapter 2 including an appropriate flight evaluation. 1.6.  Specialized  Training.  Specialized  training  (documented  in  training  folder  and  LOX)  is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned mission that is not required for every aircrew member.  It  consists  of  training  such  as  differential  training,  MCC/SD  dual  status,  LEFT,  Touch  and  Go Certification,  CPAR,  etc.  as  well  as  training  to  maintain  proficiency  in  unit  tasked  special capabilities and missions. 1.6.1.  SQ/CCs  determine  and  assign  aircrew  members  to  train  for  and  maintain  special capabilities or certifications (if applicable).  Specialized training is normally accomplished in addition to baseline CMR/BMC sortie/event requirements. 1.7.  Training  Records  and  Reports.  Units  maintain  individual  aircrew  training  records  IAW the at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm, MAJCOM and Wing directives. Disposition Records Schedule (RDS) Air Force 1.7.1.  Units will document and maintain aircrew certification/upgrade training in individual training folders IAW local directives and the Air Force RDS. 1.7.2.  Units will prepare and forward training reports IAW MAJCOM directives. 1.7.3.  Units  using  the  Aviation  Resource  Management  System  (ARMS)  maintain  aircrew training  records  IAW  ACCI  11-464,  Training  Records  and  Performance  Evaluation  in Formal Flying  Training Programs;  and AFI 11-401, as supplemented.  When documenting aircrew training in ARMS, use AF Form 1522,  ARMS Additional Training Accomplishment Input, and AF IMT 4324, ARMS Upgrade Worksheet, AFTO form 71, Aircrew MARS sheet and AFTO Form 781, ARMS Aircrew/Mission Flight Data Document.  If additional forms are needed, see AFI 33-360 for guidance. 1.7.4.  ARMS is used to track the following information for all aircrew (as applicable): 1.7.4.1.  Ground training. 1.7.4.2.  Currencies. 1.7.4.3.  Requirements and accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP missions (using 1- month and 3-month running totals  for look  back), sortie types, and  events cumulatively for the training cycle. 1.7.4.4.  Any additional training events the OG/CC deems necessary to track. 1.8.  Aircrew  Utilization  Policy.  (T-3)  Commanders  will  ensure  aircrew  members  occupy authorized  positions  IAW  unit  manning  documents  and  aircrew  status  is  properly  designated.  The overall objective is that aircrew members perform combat-related duties.  Supervisors may assign  aircrew  to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  FEB/mishap  board  member,  etc.),  but AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 13 must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of aircrew tasking, flying proficiency, currency, and experience. 1.8.1.  MAJCOM and NAF staff aircrew personnel assigned to positions that require them to perform flying duties must comply with BMC requirements. 1.8.2.  ACW and OG staff aircrew (API-6) maintain BMC or CMR status as directed by the Wing  or  OG/CC.   Wing  commanders,  wing  vice  commanders,  operations  group commanders, operations group deputy commanders, and director of personnel will maintain BMC, at a minimum. 1.8.3.  Training  While  DNIF.    Crewmembers  whose  status  is  "Duty  Not  Involving  Flying (DNIF)" will complete ground training events, including simulator training, if the member's physical  condition  allows.    RAP  events  that  are  creditable  in  an  Aircrew  Training  Device (ATD) may be logged when performing those events  while individuals  are DNIF.  Consult the  flight  surgeon  initiating  AF  Form  1042  action  as  prescribed  by  AFI  48-123,  Medical Examinations and Standards if the DNIF status includes ground-training limitations. 1.8.4.  Inexperienced  Flying  Crewmembers.    Supervisors  will  limit  the  non-flying  duties  of inexperienced aircrew in the first year of their initial operational assignment to duties related to combat activities or associated training.  Examples of unrelated duties include but are not limited  to  honor  guard,  CFC/AFAF  campaign  project  officer/NCO,  etc.    When  manning shortages occur, priority must be given to line unit-manning positions. 1.8.4.1.  Such  members  may  be  assigned  to  functional  shops  within  the  squadron  that perform  flying,  training  or  combat  related  activities  (scheduling,  training,  mission planning, weapons and tactics, safety, intelligence, current operations, etc.). 1.8.5.  Aircrew entering formal flying training leading to qualification (initial or upgrade) or requalification  will  be  dedicated  to  training  responsibilities.    Formal  flying  training responsibilities have priority over non-training related duties.   Exception: Supervisors may continue normal duties as time permits.  In situations where training is delayed in excess of two calendar weeks, members may be assigned duties not directly related to training. 1.9.  Sortie  Allocation  Guidance.  Inexperienced  aircrew  members  should  receive  sortie allocation  priority  over  experienced  aircrew  members.    Priorities  for  sortie  allocation  may  be adjusted by the OG/CC as necessary based on operational requirements. 1.10.  Waivers.  With  the  exception  of  currency  and  lookback,  ACC/A3  has  delegated  waiver authority  to  OG/CCs  for  all  requirements  of  the  RTM.    Additionally,  OG/CCs  may  adjust individual  requirements  in  Chapter  4  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  to  accommodate  variations  in aircrew member experience and performance.  Waiver authority for ground training is IAW the reference  directive.    This  delegation  does  not  apply  where  MAJCOM/A3  is  specifically  stated.  ACC/A3 will maintain waiver authority for all other provisions of this volume. 1.10.1.  Units  will  submit  waivers  directly  to  the  NAF  who  will  in  turn  forward  requests directly to MAJCOM Aircrew Training function (ex: ACC/A3C) upon concurrence.  Waiver authority  for  supplemental  guidance  will  be  as  specified  in  the  supplement  and  approved through higher level coordination authority. 1.10.2.  Duration  of  waivers  to  this  volume  will  be  IAW  AFI  33-360  and  valid  until  the Approving Official cancels in writing, revises the publication or the waiver expires. 14 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 1.10.3.  Waiver  requests/reports.    Flying  squadrons  will  send  their  waiver  requests  and reports  via  OSS/OST  who  compiles  all  squadron  waiver  requests  into  a  single  package  for OG/CC submission to through the chain of command for approval at the appropriate level. 1.10.4.  End-of-Training  Cycle  Waivers.    Squadron  commanders  will  forward,  through OSS/OST  to  OG/CC,  a  list  of  aircrew  members  requesting  waivers  and  aircrew  members downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC for failure to meet cycle continuation training requirements.  All  aircrew  members  that  fail  to  meet  end-of-cycle  requirements  are  N-CMR/N-BMC  until requirements are met or waived by OG/CC.  After OG/CC approval of waiver request, OST will submit reports to ACC. 1.11.  Training Shortfall Reports.  OSS/OST will prepare the Training Shortfall Reports at the end of each RAP cycle for OG/CCs and submit signed reports to ACC IAW Attachment 2. AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 15 Chapter 2 E-8C FORMAL TRAINING 2.1.

This  chapter  outlines  continuing  ground  and  flying  training  requirements  for CMR,  BMC,  and  BAQ  aircrew.    Continuation  Training  (CT)  should  provide  the  volume, frequency, and mix of mission-related events designed to maintain aircrew members applicable mission  ready  status  and  improve  the  ability  to  accomplish  the  unit’s  assigned  mission(s).    CT also  provides for instructor/positional upgrade. to  develop  essential  skills the  necessary  experiences required 4.1.1.  In order to participate in CT aircrew members will: 4.1.1.1.  Be  qualified  IAW  AFI  11-202V1,  AFI  11-202V2,  and  applicable  MAJCOM supplements 4.1.1.2.  Be designated BMC or CMR by squadron commander. 4.2.  Training  Cycle.  The  primary  training  period  for  flight  and  Aircrew  Training  Device (ATD)  CT  is  aligned  with  the  Aviation  Schedule  (AS)  RAP  tasking  memorandum.    The  12 month training cycle will be implemented as follows: 4.2.1.  Ground  and  flying  training  programs  will  be  designed  to  produce  training  event accomplishment in an evenly distributed fashion across the entire training cycle. 4.2.2.  Accomplishment  of  cycle  training  events  is  critical  to  aircrew  proficiency.    Crew members  will  be  required  to  complete  all  training  events  no  later  than  the  end  of  the designated training cycle. 4.2.3.  Commanders  will  report  delinquencies  to  OSS/OSTT,  who  will  consolidate  and forward their reports IAW Chapter 1 or as otherwise required. 4.3.  Aircrew  Ground  Training.  Unit  commanders  will  ensure  aircrew  members  accomplish academic  training  requirements.    Commanders  may  direct  additional  training  as  necessary  to ensure all aircrew attain and maintain a state of proficiency permitting immediate and successful completion of the assigned mission.  An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that academic  training  requirement.    Ground  training  accomplished  at  the  FTU  may  be  credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.  Ground training is comprised of the following programs: 4.3.1.  Aircrew  Training  Devices  (ATDs).    All  ATDs  will  be  managed  IAW  AFI  36-2248, Operations  and  Management  of  Aircrew  Training  Devices,  and  AFI  36-2251,  Management of Air Force Training Systems, or applicable ATD management instruction(s).

Logging of CT Requirements.  Will be per the ACC/RTM. 4.7.  Training  Documentation.  The  following  events  require  documentation  via  ACC  Form 206, Individual Mission Grade Sheet: 4.7.1.  Training  designed  to  establish  or  restore  a  member’s  mission  ready  (MR)  status.  Note: Documenting training on an ACC Form 206 is not required if supervision is provided solely for regaining currency. 4.7.2.  Specialized training leading to an upgrade, certification, or training status. 4.7.3.  Training specifically assigned by SQ/CC or Operations Officer. 4.7.4.  At  their  discretion,  instructors  may  document  crewmember  performance  whenever instructional or supervisory responsibility is exercised. 4.8.  Proration  of  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle  the  SQ/CC may  prorate  any  training  requirements  precluded  by  the  following  events:  Initial  CMR/BMC certification  date,  Duties  Not  Involving  Flight  (DNIF),  emergency  leave  or  non-flying  TDYs.  Ordinary  annual  leave  will  not  be  considered  as  non-availability.    The  following  guidelines apply: 4.8.1.  Proration  does  not  apply  to  individuals  who  are  available  for  15  days  or  less  (non-availability  >345  days)  in  a  training  cycle;  these  individuals  will  not  incur  training requirements. 4.8.2.  Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies. 4.8.3.  Proration  is  based  on  cumulative  days  of  non-availability  for  flight  in  the  training cycle. Use Table 4.3 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on cumulative non-flying calendar days. 4.8.4.  If  requalification  or  positional  upgrade  is  accomplished,  an  aircrew's  training  cycle will start over at a prorated share on the correct ARMS training table following BMC/CMR recertification. 24 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 4.8.5.  Members  completing  QT,  RQ  or  positional  upgrade  and  achieving  CMR/BMC  after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes. 4.8.6.  An aircrew's last month on station prior to a PCS may be prorated provided 1 month's proration is not exceeded.  These individuals may be considered CMR for reporting purposes during a period of 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss of CMR currency, port call date or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first. 4.8.7.  Deployed  Operations.  During  deployed  operations  expiring  ground  training  events and currencies listed in this instruction are exempted while involved in the operation unless specifically required in other instructions or guidance.

Currencies/Qualification. (T-2)  Ground training currencies and their impact on MR status are  listed  in  the  ACC  RAP  tasking  memorandum.    Currencies  for  Ground  Events  are  re-established by completing the ground training event.  The ACC RAP tasking memorandum lists all  flight  currency  requirements.    Flight  event  currency  expirations  up  to  6  months  must  be remedied  IAW  Paragraph  4.9.1.  Flight  event  currency  expirations greater than 6 months will result in UQ status and must be remedied IAW provisions specified in AFI 11-202, Vol 1. 4.9.1.  Event Currencies.  Crew members may not instruct, evaluate or perform any event in which  they  are  not  qualified  and  current  unless  under  direct  supervision  of  an instructor/evaluator or OG approved supervisor.  Currency may be established or updated by: AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 25 4.9.1.1.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crew  member  provided  member’s currency in the event has not expired. 4.9.1.2.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crew  member  under  supervision  of  a current instructor/evaluator or OG approved supervisor IAW Paragraph 1.5.3.  Members may  perform/instruct/evaluate  events  they  were  delinquent  in  upon  completing  required training  which  may  occur  during  the  same  flight  or  simulation  sortie.    Note:  Instructor Pilots are required to supervise the update of expired pilot currencies as required in AFI 11-202, Vol. 3. 4.9.1.3.  Comply with applicable recurrency/requalification requirements in AFI 11-202, Vol 1. 4.9.1.4.  Events  satisfactorily  performed  on  any  evaluation  may  be  used  to  establish  or update currency in that event. 4.9.2.  Commander-Directed Downgrade.  Will be IAW AFI 11-202, Vol. 2. 4.10.  CMR/BMC Regression.  Regress qualified aircrew members to applicable non-MR status (N-CMR/N-BMC)  for  failure lookback requirements.  Unless specifically listed in the ACC RAP tasking memorandum, no other flight events or currencies will affect MR status.  Aircrew members will revert to applicable non-MR status  for  failure  to  maintain  ground-training  currencies  affecting  MR  status  (see  ACC  RAP tasking memorandum). to  maintain  ACC  RAP tasking  memorandum 4.10.1.  For  aircrew  members  regressed  to  non-MR  status,  the  SQ/CC  will  direct  a  re- certification program to bring the aircrew member up to CMR standards. 4.10.2.  Lookback.  Lookback  is  no  longer  based  exclusively  on  sorties.  It  is  calculated based  on  the  total  number  of  live  and  simulator  primary  missions.    Details  on  calculating lookback by crew position are contained in the ACC RTM. 4.10.3.  Lookback is determined at the beginning of each calendar month.  Failure to meet 1-month  RAP  lookback  requires  a  review  of  the  member’s  3-month  mission  history.    For example, on the 1st day in May the 1-month lookback is April.  If the required number was not accomplished in April then review mission history for April, March, and February. If the 3-month lookback has been met, member will remain CMR. 4.10.3.1.  If the member fails to meet the 3 month look back, one of the following SQ/CC actions is required: 4.10.3.1.1.  Aircrew  members  will  regress  to  N-CMR  status  and  establish  training requirements to regain status within the month found delinquent. 4.10.3.1.2.  Place  aircrew  in  probation  status  for  one  month.    If  SQ/CC  chooses probation,  the  aircrew  member  will  reestablish  a  one-month  lookback  at  the  end  of the probation period to remain CMR. 4.10.3.1.3.  Remove the aircrew member from a CMR manning position. 4.10.3.1.4.  Initiate action to remove the aircrew member from active flying status. 4.10.3.1.5.  Request lookback waiver from ACC/A3. 26 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 4.10.3.2.  Following  establishment  of  a  CMR  date,  all  aircrew  will  meet  the  1-month lookback to maintain the assigned status until a 3-month lookback history is established.  If  an  individual  fails  to  meet  the  1-month  lookback  before  they  establish  a  3-  month lookback,  they  will  either  be  regressed  to  N-CMR  or  they  may,  at  the  SQ/CC’s discretion,  be  given  a  15  day  extension  to  meet  1-month  lookback.    Extensions  will  be noted on the N-CMR letter. Figure 4.1.  RAP Regression Flow Chart. 4.11.  Restrictions for N-BMC/N-CMR. (T-2) 4.11.1.  Aircrew members that regress to N-CMR/N-BMC status may not deploy overseas or participate  on  HHQ  tasked  sorties  as  an  operational  aircrew  member.    The  member  may deploy in a ground position (Liaison Officer (LNO), Mission Planning Team, etc.) provided they  meet  theater-specific  ground  training  requirements.    Note:  This  requirement  does  not apply to E-8C ferry operations. 4.12.  Establishing/Regaining CMR/BMC Status.  Once requisite ground and flying training is accomplished, Squadron DOT will accomplish a CMR/BMC memo documenting the satisfactory  AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 27 completion of training and recommending return of individual to applicable MR status.  SQ/CC signed memorandum is the sole document removing and restoring individuals to appropriate MR status.  Memorandums will be filed in the individual’s training records. 4.13.  Delinquencies (Failure to Complete Required Training).  Aircrew members who fail to meet RAP requirements by the end of the training cycle will be downgraded to N-CMR/N-BMC.  Unless waived IAW Paragraph 1.10, remaining training requirements must be made up during the  next  RAP  training  cycle  and  aircrew  member  will  remain  N-CMR/N-BMC  until  the  non-waived sorties/events are accomplished.  Accomplishment of delinquent training will be tracked manually  and  documented  in  the  aircrew  member’s  training  record.    Currency  dates  will  be carried over to the next cycle.  In the case of new RAP requirements, initial currency date will be the first day of the training cycle. If an event name changes, but the definition/intent is the same, the currency date of the similar event from the previous cycle will be used for the new event. 4.14.  Ground  Training.  Aircrew  ground  training  will  be  accomplished  IAW  reference directives as summarized in the RAP tasking memorandum, Attachment 3 and include mission-essential ground training which must be completed in order to fly, general flying-related ground training  requirements  that  affect  RAP  status  and  other  ground  training  applicable  to  aircrew members.  While some training requirements do not affect a crewmember’s RAP status, one or more may be required prior to deployment to an operational theater.  Aircrew members who fail to complete ground-training requirements must accomplish IAW the reference directive.   Note:  Where  discrepancies  exist,  the  reference  directive  takes  precedence.    Waiver  authority  for  the ground training specified is IAW the reference directive. 28 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 Chapter 5 UPGRADE/SPECIALIZED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 5.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  minimum  eligibility  criteria  and  training  requirements for upgrade and specialized training. 5.2.  Requirements.  Upgrade Training (UGT) requirements provide aircrew members with  the academic,  ATD,  and/or  flying  training  needed  to  attain  a  higher  level  of  E-8  aircrew qualification.  Qualification and ground training currencies will be updated so not to expire prior to one month beyond scheduled completion of UGT/IUP training. (T-3). 5.3.  Waivers/Extensions. 5.3.1.  HQ ACC/A3 is the waiver authority for ACC syllabi.  (T-2) 5.3.1.1.  Syllabus pre-requisites are mandatory and must be completed prior to reporting to  the  FTU  for  training  unless  waived  by  ACC/A3.    Locally  derived  pre-requisites  are IAW local guidance. 5.3.2.  HQ ACC/A3 is the approval authority to conduct in-unit formal training, and is waiver authority to change the formal requirements of in-unit conducted UGT. (T-2)  116/461 ACW units will forward waiver request through channels to HQ ACC/A3C. 5.3.3.  Requests to conduct in-unit formal training will include the following: 5.3.3.1.  Justification for in-unit training in lieu of formal course training. 5.3.3.2.  Summary of individual's flying experience. 5.3.3.3.  Date training will begin and expected completion date. 5.3.3.4.  Requested exceptions to formal course syllabus, with rationale. 5.4.  Instructor Upgrade.  Instructor upgrades are accomplished IAW applicable ACC approved syllabi. (T-2) 5.4.1.  Instructor Upgrade Training Selection.  In addition to ACC syllabus prerequisites, the following requirements must be met prior to course entry: 5.4.1.1.  Candidates  will  have  at  least  one  evaluation  in  addition  to  an  initial  crew qualification evaluation. 5.4.1.2.  Candidate  selection  must  be  based  upon  the  candidate’s  demonstrated  flying skills, potential to instruct, technical knowledge, and needs of the Air Force.  Candidate should  receive  a  mix  of  live-fly  and  simulator  missions  with  a  qualified  instructor.  SQ/DOT  offices  and  CCs  should  evaluate  candidate’s  proficiency  and  demonstrated performance 5.4.1.3.  Prior  to  Aircrew  Management  Board  (ACMB)  nomination,  SQ/CCs  must  have documentation  with  at  least  one  recommend  ACC  Form  206  from  an  instructor  in  the recommended crew position and have reviewed the member’s training folder. 5.4.1.4.  Aircrew members nominated for Instructor Upgrade must have been designated as experienced by the SQ/CC. AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 29 5.4.2.  Previously Qualified Instructors. 5.4.2.1.  Candidates previously instructor qualified in another MDS are required to meet the requirements of  Paragraphs 5.4- 5.4.1.4 and applicable course prerequisites but are not  required  to  complete  the  entire  E-8  Flight  Instructor  Upgrade  course  (E8FIC).  Specific information on required training can be found in the E8FIC syllabus. 5.4.2.2.  Prior  qualified  E-8C  aircrew  instructors  are  only  required  to  complete  the respective flight-phase ACC syllabus. 5.5.  Positional  Upgrade  Training  (UGT).  Positional  UGT  is  formal  training  that  qualifies  a crewmember  into  an  authorized  E-8  crew  position  other  than  that  currently  held.    UGT  will consist  of  academic,  ATD,  and  flying  training  conducted  IAW  the  ACC-approved  syllabus.  Personnel upgrading in an aircraft will incur an ADSC IAW AFI 36-2107 5.5.1.  Positional  Upgrade  Training  Selection.  Candidates  will  be  selected  for  upgrade training  based  upon  their  demonstrated  ability,  experience,  and  potential  to  successfully assume  increased  responsibility  and  performance  by  the  SQ/CC.    Additional  nomination requirements might apply in local OG/CC-approved guidance. 5.5.1.1.  Aircrew  members  who  are  nominated  for  Positional  Upgrade  must  have  been designated  as  experienced  by  the  SQ/CC.    Exception:  Copilots  may  be  inexperienced prior to upgrade to AC. 5.5.1.2.  Prior to ACMB nomination, SQ/CCs must have documentation with at least one recommend  ACC  Form  206  from  an  instructor  in  the  recommended  crew  position  and have reviewed the member’s training folder. Table 5.1.  Positional Upgrade Requisites. Unless waived, upgrade candidates must meet the following requirements: Position Flight Hour Minimums Notes Pilot (AC) 1000 total/750 E-8C MCC SD SDT * First assignment Copilots only require 750 E-8C hrs. 500 E-8C as SD 500 E-8C as AWO 500 E-8C as AOT Designation as Experienced CP not required Designated as Experienced SD Designated as Experienced AWO Designated as Experienced AOT and Grade of E-5 (select) or higher and ALS graduate 5.5.2.  Failure  to  Meet  Training  Standards.  Failure to meet academic or flying standards while  enrolled  in  a  USAF-directed  formal  flying  training  course  (includes  instructor  and positional upgrade) requires an examination of the aircrew member’s potential for continued 30 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 aviation  service.    When  rated  officers  or  career  enlisted  aviators  fail  to  meet  training standards,  the  only  acceptable  method  of  removal  from  formal  flying  courses  is  through  a Flight Evaluation Board (FEB) or FEB waiver IAW AFI 11-402. 5.5.3.  Administrative Withdrawal from Training.  See Chapter 2, Paragraph 2.1.13. 5.6.  Training  Documentation.  All  upgrade special qualification, certification, etc.) will be appropriately documented and maintained as part of the member’s permanent training record. (positional, training instructor, 5.6.1.  Failure to complete training within 120 days of the first flight (240 days for traditional ANG  personnel)  requires  notification  to  HQ  ACC/A3C  (info  copy  ACC/A3G  and ANG/A3O)  with  aircrew  member's  name,  rank,  reason  for  the  delay,  planned  actions  and estimated completion date. 5.7.  MCC/SD Dual Status.  MCCs previously qualified as E-8C Senior Directors may maintain dual training status as both an MCC and SD.  Members maintaining a dual training status afford commanders  flexibility  in  filling  crew  positions  of  MCC,  SD  or  AWO  as  needed.    MCCs maintaining  dual  status  may  fly  as  an  SD  provided  currency  is  maintained  as  described  in  the ACC RAP tasking memorandum. 5.7.1.  Designation of dual status MCCs is strictly determined by unit commanders.  Prior to designation, the following requirements must be met: 5.7.1.1.  Current  and  qualified  MCC,  500  E-8C  hours  as  an  SD  and  certified  as  an experienced SD. 5.7.1.2.  Identified  on  qualification  letter  (letter  of  X)  as  Dual  Status  MCC.    Note:  Additional  unit  certification  requirements  are  optional;  however,  when  established,  unit requirements will be mandatory. 5.7.2.  Dual status crewmembers that go non-current for SD-only events can fly unrestricted as  an  MCC.    Before  flying  unsupervised  as  an  SD,  they  must  meet  requirements  to  regain currency in those events they are non-current. 5.8.  Touch and Go (T&G) Training. 5.8.1.  Once designated by the SQ/CC as “experienced” Aircraft Commanders are authorized to  perform  T&Gs  without  IP  supervision.   Aircraft  Commanders’  progression  to “experienced” requires the following T&G training and certification: 5.8.2.  Fly  a  minimum  of  one  Emergency  Procedures  simulator  sortie,  specifically  tailored for T&G procedures.  The simulator sortie will be documented via an ACC Form 206.  The Aircraft Commander must demonstrate T&G performance to an ACC Performance Grade of “2”  as  described  in  ACCI  11-464.    Simulator  session  may  be  combined  with  CPAR Emergency Procedure simulator sortie. 5.8.3.  Fly a minimum of one sortie under IP supervision.  Sortie will be flown from the left seat. At least three T&G maneuvers must be performed.  The sortie will be documented on an ACC Form 206.  The Aircraft Commander must demonstrate T&G performance to an ACC Performance Grade of “2,” as described in ACCI 11-464, and receive a recommendation to perform  T&G  maneuvers  without  IP  supervision.    T&G  events  may  be  performed  on  the AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 31 same  sortie  as  CPAR  events.    Upon  completion  of  these  requirements,  the  Squadron Commander may elect to certify the AC for Touch and Go’s on the Letter of X’s. 5.8.4.  Experienced  Aircraft  Commanders  will  maintain  T&G  currency  and  RAP  cycle requirements IAW ACC RTM and may dual-log with Landing, Night Landing, Three-Engine Landing and Takeoff as applicable.  T&G RAP cycle requirements may be prorated using the T&G  certification  date  as  a  start  date  and  IAW  specific  events  and  policies  listed  in Paragraph 4.8. 5.9.  Monitor  Copilot  Air  Refueling.  In  order  to  provide  qualified  Copilots  additional opportunities  to  improve  air  refueling  skills,  Aircraft  Commanders  (AC),  designated  as “experienced”  are  authorized  to  allow  certified  Copilots  to  air  refuel.    Aircraft  Commanders’ progression to “experienced” requires the following CPAR training: 5.9.1.  Fly  a  minimum  of  one  Emergency  Procedures  simulator  sortie,  specifically  tailored for  AR  procedures.    The  simulator  sortie  will  be  documented  via  an  ACC  Form  206.    The Aircraft Commander must demonstrate AR Emergency Procedures performance to an ACC Performance  Grade  of  “2”  as  described  in  ACCI  11-464.    Simulator  session  may  be combined with T&G Emergency Procedure simulator sortie. 5.9.2.  Fly a minimum of one sortie under IP supervision.  Sortie will be flown from the left seat  with  the  IP  sitting  in  the  right  seat  performing  AR  procedures.    The  sortie  will  be documented on an ACC Form 206.  The Aircraft Commander must demonstrate the ability to monitor AR operations to an ACC Performance Grade of “2,” as described in ACCI 11-464, and receive a recommendation to monitor CPAR without IP supervision.  CPAR events may be performed on the same sortie as T&G events. 5.10.  Copilot Air Refueling (CPAR).  In order to be certified to air refuel with an experienced Aircraft Commander, a Copilot must be endorsed by an Instructor Pilot on an ACC Form 206 to conduct  air  refueling  with  an  experienced  Aircraft  Commander  and  be  certified  as  such  by  the SQ/CC on the letter of X’s. 5.10.1.  Copilot air refueling currency and RAP cycle requirements will be equivalent to that of an inexperienced Aircraft Commander as outlined in the RTM.

Academic courses  are  designed  to  prepare  students  for  simulator/flight  training  and  normally  completed before beginning that training. Aircrew Training Device (ATD)—Hands-on training aids used to prepare aircrew members for the  actual  performance  of  flight  duties.    Includes  Cockpit  Procedure  Trainer  (CPT),  Part  Task Trainer (PTT), Weapons Systems Trainer (WST), Mission Maintenance Trainer (MMT), Prime Mission  Equipment  Maintenance  Training  Device  (PME-MTD)  or  Navigator  Training  System (NTS). Aircrew  Training  System  (ATS)—An  integrated  qualification,  upgrade,  and  continuation training  program  for  crewmembers.    Civilian  contractors  conduct  most  academic  and  ATD training.  Air Force personnel conduct all flight training. Basic  Aircraft  Qualified  (BAQ)—BAQ  aircrew  members  have  completed  a  flight  evaluation IAW  AFI  11-2E-8V2,  Aircrew  Evaluation  Criteria,  and  are  qualified  to  perform  basic  aircrew duties in the E-8C Basic Mission Capable (BMC)—BMC positions (normally API-6/8/B/D) are filled by aircrew who have a primary job performing HQ, NAF, and selected wing supervision or staff functions (subject  to  OG/CC  discretion).    BMC  aircrew  will  maintain  familiarization  with  all  unit  core missions. Cockpit Procedures  Trainer (CPT)—A training device in which instruments and displays are activated  to  respond  to  trainee  inputs.    Used  for  safety  of  flight,  instrument,  normal,  and emergency procedures. Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)—All  API-1/2/A  positions,  line  flying  officer  and  enlisted aircrew members, flying SQ/CC and SQ/DO positions are designated CMR positions.  OG/CCs may designate other API-6 positions not assigned to the flying squadron as CMR.  CMR aircrew will maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of the flying unit to which they are  assigned  or  attached.    CMR  aircrew  maintain  currencies  which  affect  CMR  status, accomplish  all  core  designated  flight  training  (sorties  and  events),  and  all  mission  ground training.  Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regression to N-CMR status. Continuation Training (CT)—Training designed to maintain proficiency and improve aircrew capabilities to perform unit missions. Course Training Document (CTD)—Documented guidance for a particular training course that includes a synopsis of training, resource requirements, and equipment allocations. Direct  Supervision—An aircrew member is  considered under direct  supervision  when  another crew member of like specialty has the capability to immediately assume the primary crew duties.  A  pilot  under  direct  supervision  of  another  pilot  means  the  supervising  pilot  occupies  a  set  of flight controls. AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 39 Dual Status—A term when combined with crew 2 crew positions (i.e. MCC/SD) identifies crew members who maintain a primary crew position qualification but may also fly and fulfill duties of another crew position in which they were previously qualified. Event—The accomplishment of a specific training element, function, or task. Flight  Instructor  Course—Basic  Instructor  Academics.    E-8C  specific  academics  and  crew position specific academics. Formal  School  Courseware—Training materials and programs  developed for training  aircrew members  at  formal  schools.    It  includes  all  student  study  guides,  workbooks,  computer-based training lessons, slide tape lessons, and instructor guides related to the specific course. Inexperienced/Experienced  (I/E)  Aircrew—A  designation  used  to  determine  the  level  of training a crewmember receives within each RAP level. Instructor  CRM—One-time  training  event  required  of  all  E-8C  instructors  prior  to  assuming duties as an instructor. Look back—Based on a RAP sortie; calculated on a calendar month basis. Mission Ready Status—Abbreviated term denoting BMC and CMR. Proficiency—Demonstrated  ability  to  successfully  accomplish  tasked  event  safely  and effectively.   For purposes of this instruction, proficiency  also  requires  currency  in  the event, if applicable.  Currency and proficiency may or may not be synonymous. QUAL—Aircrew has demonstrated to an instructor / evaluator the capability to accomplish the event. Ready  Aircrew  Program  (RAP)—The  CT  program  designed  to  focus  on  ground  and  flying training to  accomplish  a unit's basic tasked missions in  support of worldwide tasking.  Applies only to BMC and CMR crew members. RAP Tasking Memorandum—A  MAJCOM  coordinated  document  usually produced  prior each training  cycle used to  tailor specific training events,  frequencies, currencies, and rules for crediting training events.  The ACC RAP tasking memorandum allows customization of training within the confines of the parent instruction. Specialized Training—any special skill necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions that is not required of every crewmember.  40 AFI11-2E-8V1  25 JUNE 2015 Attachment 2 ACC TRAINING SHORTFALL REPORT MEMORANDUM FOR HQ ACC/A3                                                                 (Date)  FROM: 116 OG/CC SUBJECT: AEF Cycle RAP Training Shortfall Report 1.
