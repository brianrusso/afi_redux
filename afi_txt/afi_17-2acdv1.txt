Review programs and manning position designations annually. (T-2) request,  provide  AFSPC/A2/3/6T train.  Upon 1.3.3.4.  Develop  additional training requirements and/or programs as necessary to meet unit  mission  requirements.  Units  may  include  these  requirements  in  local  training procedures. (T-2) 1.3.4.  Squadrons  (SQ).  The  SQ/CCs  top  training  priority  should  be  to  train  all  designated crewmembers to BMC or MR/CMR. Squadron supervision will (T-3): 1.3.4.1.  Maintain  training  forms  and  unit  certification  documents  for  all  squadron personnel and personnel attached to the squadron for cyberspace operations. Certification documentation will be a summary of certification awarded and signed by the Operations Group  (OG)/CC,  or  SQ/CC.  Letters  of  certification  may  be  maintained  via  electronic storage. (T-3) 1.3.4.2.  Ensure  adequate  continuity  and  supervision  of  individual  training  needs, experience and proficiencies of assigned and attached crewmembers. (T-3) 1.3.4.3.  Ensure  review  of training  and  evaluation  records  of  newly  assigned crewmembers and those completing formal training to determine the training required for them to achieve BMC or MR status and to ensure provisions of this volume are met. (T-3) 1.3.4.4.  Ensure  Ready  Cybercrew  Program  (RCP)  missions  are  oriented  towards maintaining  basic  skills  or  tactical  employment  simulating  conditions  anticipated  in  the unit mission. Provide guidance to ensure only effective RCP missions are logged. (T-3) AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 7 1.3.4.5.

Assist the wing or group in the development of the unit training programs. (T-3) 1.3.4.9.  Monitor individual assigned and attached crewmember currencies, proficiencies, and requirements. (T-3) 1.3.4.10.  Ensure crewmembers participate only in sorties, missions, events, and tasks for which they are prepared, trained, qualified and certified.  (T-3) 1.3.4.11.  Ensure  flight  commanders  or  designated  representatives  monitor  quality  of training,  identify  training  deficiencies,  and  advise  SQ/CC  of  additional  training  needs. (T-3) 1.3.4.12.  Execute unit-level crewmember certifications described in this instruction.  (T-3) 1.3.5.  Individual crewmembers will: 1.3.5.1.  Be responsible for monitoring and completing all training requirements. (T-3) 1.3.5.2.  Ensure they participate only in operational activities for which they are prepared, trained, qualified and certified. (T-3) 1.4.  Processing Changes.  Process changes using the AF Form 847, IAW AFI 33-360, through local and MAJCOM training channels to USAF/A3C/A6C for approval.  (T-2) 1.5.  Training.  Crewmember  training  is  designed  to  progress  a  crewmember  from  Initial Qualification  Training  (IQT),  through  Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT),  to  annual Continuation  Training  (CT).  Requalification  Training  (RT),  Upgrade  Training,  and  Instructor Training are additional training requirements to the ACD weapon system. 1.5.1.  IQT.  IQT  includes  training  that  will  normally  be  conducted  during  formal  syllabus courses at the Formal Training Unit (FTU). See Chapter 2. 1.5.2.  MQT.  MQT  is  a  unit-developed  training  program  that  upgrades  IQT-complete crewmembers  to  BMC  or  MR  status  to  accomplish  the  unit  DOC  statement  mission.  See Chapter 3. 1.5.3.  All  CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z  designated  positions,  to  include  SQ/CC  and  SQ/DO  positions, should maintain MR status. The OG/CC may designate other CPI-6/B positions not assigned to the squadron as MR. See Attachment 4 for CPI explanation and definitions. (T-1) 1.5.4.  MR  /  CMR.    MR  is  a  status  that  denotes  a  crewmember  has  received  the  minimum training required to be certified, current  and proficient in all of the primary DOC statement mission  requirements  of  their  assigned  or  attached  unit.    MR  crewmembers  will  maintain currencies  that  affect  MR  status,  accomplish  all  core  designated  training  (missions  and events),  and  all  mission  related  training.  Failure  to  complete  required  MR  training  or 8 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 maintain currencies could result in regression to non-MR (NMR) status unless waived by the approval authority. 1.5.5.  BMC. A status that denotes a crewmember is receiving the minimum training required to be familiar with all (and may be certified, current, and proficient in some) of the primary DOC statement mission requirements of their assigned or attached unit. 1.5.5.1.  All  ACD  crew  positions  not  designated  as  MR-coded  positions,  are  by  default BMC-coded  positions.  BMC-coded  positions  are  assigned  to  crewmembers  with  the primary  job  of  performing  wing  supervision  or  staff  functions  directly  supporting cyberspace  operations  (e.g.,  wing  staff,  Operations  Support  Squadron  (OSS)  personnel, etc.). Many of these crewmembers are required to provide additional capability, either in lieu of or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the operational squadrons. (T-3) 1.5.5.2.  BMC  crewmembers  must  be  able  to  attain  MR  status  and,  if  required, certification/qualification  in  30  days  or  less  for  those  missions/events  in  which  they maintain familiarization only. (T-3) 1.5.5.3.  BMC crewmembers accomplish  all mission related training designated by their attached SQ/CC. (T-3) 1.5.5.4.  BMC crewmembers may participate in any real-world mission in which they are current,  proficient,  and  certified/qualified,  without  any  additional  training,  with  the supervision of an instructor as determined by the SQ/CC. 1.5.5.5.  Failure to complete required BMC training will result in regression to non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, SQ/CC will determine missions the crewmembers may perform and ensure an instructor supervises the member during real-world mission. (T-3) 1.5.6.  Upgrade training is normally accomplished after a crewmember is assigned MR/BMC status and is normally in addition to MR/BMC requirements except for Mission Commander (MC) training. 1.5.6.1.  SQ/CCs will select crewmembers for upgrade training. (T-3) 1.6.  Training Concepts and Policies: 1.6.1.  Units  will  design  training  programs  to  achieve  the  highest  degree  of  readiness consistent with  safety and resource availability.  Training must balance the need  for realism against  the  expected  threat,  crew  capabilities,  and  safety.  This  volume  provides  training guidelines and polices for use with operational procedures specified in applicable operational publications. (T-3) 1.6.2.  Design  training  to  achieve  mission  capability  in  squadron-tasked  roles,  maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RCP training missions should emphasize either basic combat skills, or scenarios reflecting procedures and operations based on  employment  plans,  location,  current  intelligence,  and  opposition  capabilities.  Use  of procedures and actions applicable to mission scenarios are desired. (T-3) 1.6.3.  Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary to accomplish the required training. If the mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor is required. (T-3) AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 9 1.7.  Experienced  Crewmember  Requirements.  ACD  operators  are  declared  experienced  on the weapon system when they meet the requirements in Table 1.1. (T-3) Table 1.1.  Experienced Crewmember Requirements. Position Declared Experienced (Hours)        400        400 Mission Commander (Hours)          N/A          N/A Notes            1         400        400 ACD-Operator (ACD-O) ACD Operations Controller (ACD-OC) ACD Crew Commander (ACD-CC) ACD Operator, Host-Base Security ACD-O/HBS ACD Operator, Incident Response ACD-O/IRO  ACD-O, Defensive Counter-Cyberspace  ACD-O/DCC Notes: 1. ACD operators with previous cyberspace weapon system experience are declared experienced when they achieve 300 hours operating the ACD weapon system.          800          N/A          N/A        400          N/A        400     1.8.  RCP Policy and Management: 1.8.1.  The  RCP  training  cycle  coincides  with  the  government  fiscal  year  and  is  executed IAW the RCP Tasking Memo (RTM). Each RCP CT status (i.e. BMC/MR) is defined by a total number of RCP missions, broken down into mission types, plus specific qualifications and associated events as determined by HHQ guidance and unit commanders. (T-3) 1.8.2.  The total number of RCP missions for BMC/MR is the primary factor for maintaining an  individual's  CT  status.  The  breakout  of  mission  types  is  provided  as  a  guideline  to  be followed  as  closely  as  possible  but  minor  variances  are  authorized.  Variations  in  mission types  may  be  used  as  a  basis  for  regression  as  directed  by  the  SQ/CC.  Certification  in  a mission  is  determined  by  the  SQ/CC  considering  higher  headquarters  (HHQ)  guidance  and the individual's capabilities. (T-3) 1.8.3.  An effective RCP training mission requires accomplishing a tactical mission profile or a building block type mission. Each mission requires successfully  completing a majority of the applicable events, as determined by the SQ/CC and Attachment 2. (T-3) 1.8.4.  Progression from BMC to MR requires: 1.8.4.1.  A 1-month look back at the MR mission rate. (T-3) 1.8.4.2.  Certification/qualification in all core missions and events required at MR. (T-3) 1.8.4.3.  Confirmation  that  the  progressed  crewmember  can  complete  the  prorated number  of  mission  and  event  requirements  remaining  at  MR  by  the  end  of  the  training cycle. (T-3) 1.8.4.4.  Completion  of  mission-related  training,  to  include  a  current  certification  as applicable to the assigned unit’s DOC statement. (T-3) 10 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 1.8.5.  Wing MR and BMC crewmembers will complete the required monthly mission rate. If unable, refer to Regression, paragraph 4.9. (T-3) 1.8.6.  End of cycle training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level, as outlined in paragraph 1.7, on the last day of the current training cycle. (T-3) 1.9.  Training Mission Program Development: 1.9.1.  RTM  BMC/MR  mission  and  event  requirements  apply  to  all  BMC  and  MR crewmembers  as  well  as  those  carrying  special  mission  certifications/qualifications  (see Attachment 2). The standard mission requirements listed in the RTM establish the minimum number of missions per training cycle for BMC and MR levels of training. The RTM takes precedence  over  this  volume  and  may  contain  updated  requirements,  missions,  events,  or tasks  not  yet  incorporated  into  Attachment  2.  The  RTM  applies  to  all  ACD  crewmembers.  (T-2) 1.9.2.  Non-effective  sorties  are  logged  when  a  training  sortie  is  planned  and  started,  but  a majority (51%) of valid training for that type of mission is not accomplished due to system malfunction,  power  failures,  etc.  To  fully  account  for  all  sorties,  including  those  sorties impacted by system malfunctions and power failures, log and report non-effective sorties. (T-3) 1.10.  Training Records and Reports: 1.10.1.  Units  will  maintain  crewmember  records  for  individual  training  and  evaluations IAW: 1.10.1.1.  AFI 17-202V1. 1.10.1.2.  AFI 17-202V2, Cybercrew Standardization & Evaluation. 1.10.1.3.  Any additional HHQ supplement to the above mentioned volumes. 1.10.2.  Track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable): 1.10.2.1.  Mission-related  training  (e.g.,  tactics  training,  crew  resource  management training, etc.). (T-3) 1.10.2.2.  Requirements  and  accomplishment  of  individual  sorties,  mission  types,  and events cumulatively for the training cycle. (T-3) 1.10.2.3.  RCP  mission  requirements  and  accomplishment  using  1-month  and  3-month running totals for lookback commensurate with CT status (BMC/MR). (T-3) 1.10.2.4.  Currencies. 1.11.  Crewmember Utilization Policy: 1.11.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  wing/group  crewmember  (CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z)  fill  authorized positions  IAW  Unit  Manning  Documents  (UMD)  and  that  crewmember  status  is  properly designated  (see  Attachment  4  for  CPI  explanation  and  definitions)  (T-3).  The  overall objective  is  for  crewmembers  to  perform  mission-related  duties.  Supervisors  may  assign crewmembers  to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  operational  review  board  (ORB), etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crewmember tasking, proficiency,  currency,  and  experience.  For  inexperienced  crewmembers  in  the  first  year  of AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 11 their initial operational assignment, supervisors should limit non-crewmember duties to those related to unit mission activities. (T-3) 1.11.2.  Evaluators may be used to instruct any phase of training they are qualified to teach to capitalize  on  their  expertise  and  experience.  If  an  evaluator  is  an  individual’s  primary  or recommending instructor, the same evaluator shall not administer  the associated evaluation. (T-3) 1.12.  Sortie Allocation and Unit Manpower Guidance: 1.12.1.  In general, inexperienced CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z crewmembers should receive priority over experienced crewmembers. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.12.1.1.  Operational  Units.  MR  CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z,  MQT  CPI-1/-2/-A/-Z,  MR  CPI-6/-8/-B/-D, MQT CPI-6/-8/-B/-D, and BMC. (T-3) 1.12.2.  Units  should  provide  assigned  CPI-6/-8/-B/-D  crewmembers  adequate  resources  to maintain minimum training requirements. However, CPI-6/-8/-B/-D support will not come at the expense of the squadron’s primary mission. (T-3) 1.13.  Training  on  Operational  Missions.  Unless  specifically  prohibited  or  restricted  by weapons  system  operating  procedures,  specific  theater  operations  order  (OPORD),  or  specific HHQ  guidance, the  OG/CC  exercising  operational  control  may  approve  upgrade, certification/qualification,  or  special  certification/qualification  training  on  operational  missions. In  order  to  maximize  efficient  utilization  of  training  resources,  units  will  take  maximum advantage of opportunities to  conduct  appropriate CT items  that may be conveniently suited to concurrent operational mission segments.

(T-2) 16 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION AND CERTIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  MQT  is  a  unit-developed  training  program  that  upgrades  IQT-complete crewmembers to BMC or MR status to accomplish the unit DOC statement missions. Guidance in this chapter, which represents the minimum, is provided to assist SQ/CCs in developing their MQT  program,  which  must  have  OG/CC  approval  prior  to  use.  Squadrons  may  further  tailor their  program  for  individual  crewmembers,  based  on  current  qualifications  (e.g.,  USAFWS graduate,  Instructor),  certifications  (e.g.,  mission  commander  (MC),  defensive  counter-cyberspace  (DCC),  Stan/Eval),  experience,  currency,  documented  performance,  and  formal training. Squadrons may use applicable portions of MQT to create a recertification program for crewmembers who regress from MR to BMC status. (T-3) 3.1.1.  MQT will be completed within 90 calendar days starting from the crewmember’s first duty  day  in  the  gaining  unit.  If  the  crewmember  elects  to  take  leave  prior  to  being  entered into MQT, the timing will begin after the termination of the leave. Training is complete upon SQ/CC  certification  of  BMC/MR  status  (subsequent  to  the  successful  completion  of  the MQT  mission  qualification  evaluation (through MAJCOM/A3TT or equivalent) either if training exceeds the 90-day time period or there is a delay  beginning  MQT  (e.g.,  due  to  security  clearance)  that  exceeds  30  days.    For  ARC crewmembers, MQT will start within 90 days from competing IQT. (T-3) (MSN)).  Notify  MAJCOM/A3T 3.2.  Mission-Related Training: 3.2.1.  Units  will  develop  blocks  of  instruction  covering  areas  pertinent  to  the  mission  as determined by the SQ/CC.  Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this requirement. (T-3) 3.2.2.  Mission-related training may be tailored to the individual's background and experience or particular local conditions.  Current and available reference materials, such as AFTTP 3-1.ACD,  other  applicable  AFTTP  3-1s  and  3-3s,  unit  guides,  and  other  available  training material and programs, will be used as supporting materials to the maximum extent possible.

(T-3) 3.3.  Initial Certification: 3.3.1.  Initial  Certification  of  MR  crewmembers  will  be  completed  within  30  days  after completing  MQT  (recommended,  but  not  required  for  BMC  crewmembers).  Failure  to comply  will  result  in  regression  to  NMR  until  complete.  Suggested  briefing  guides  are  at Attachment  3.  Each  crewmember  will  demonstrate  to  a  formal  board  a  satisfactory knowledge of the squadron’s primary DOC statement missions. The purpose of this board is to  act  as  final  check  before  certifying  a  crewmember  as  MR.  Board  composition  will  be established  by  the  SQ/CC.  Desired  composition  is  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO  (chairman),  weapons and tactics, training, intelligence, and other mission-area expert representatives. (T-3) 3.4.  Mission Training: 3.4.1.  At  SQ/CC  discretion,  applicable  missions  from  those  listed  below  will  be  used  to build  the  local  MQT  program.  MQT  programs  should  use  profiles  typical  of  squadron missions. (T-3) 3.4.2.  Supervision.  A  SQ  instructor  is  required  for  all  training  missions  unless  specified otherwise. (T-3) 3.4.3.  Minimum  Sortie  Requirements.  The  minimum  sorties  required  in  a  local  MQT program will be IAW the MQT course syllabus (not required if portions of the MQT program are used to recertify crewmembers that regress from MR to BMC). (T-3) 3.4.4.  Mission  sequence  and  prerequisites  will  be  IAW  the  appropriate  unit  MQT  course syllabus (unless waived). (T-3) 3.4.5.  Mission Objectives: Be familiar with local area requirements and procedures. Specific Mission  Tasks:  local  area  familiarization,  emergency  procedures,  other  tasks  and  as determined. (T-3) 3.4.6.  Individual events may be accomplished anytime during MQT, however all events will be accomplished prior to SQ/CC certification of BMC/MR status. (T-3) 3.4.7.  Training  will  be  completed  within  the  time  specified  by  the  syllabus.  Failure  to complete  within  the  specified  time  limit  requires  notification  through  channels  to  the MAJCOM/A3T  with  crewmember’s  name,  rank,  reason  for  delay,  planned  actions,  and estimated completion date. (T-2) 3.4.8.  Crewmembers in MQT will train under the appropriate supervision as annotated in the formal course syllabus until completing the MSN evaluation. (T-3) 3.4.9.  Formal  course  syllabus  mission  objectives  and  tasks  are  minimum  requirements  for MQT.  However,  additional  training  events,  based  on  student  proficiency  and  background, may  be  incorporated  into  the  MQT  program  with  SQ/CC  authorization. Additional  training due  to  student  non-progression  is  available  within  the  constraints  of  the  formal  course syllabus and may be added at SQ/CC discretion. (T-3)  18 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 3.5.  MQT for Senior Officers: 3.5.1.  All  senior  officer  training  (colonel  selects  and  above)  will  be  conducted  at  the  unit. (T-2) 3.5.2.  Senior  officers  must  meet  course  entry  prerequisites  and  will  complete  all  syllabus requirements unless waived by the MAJCOM/A3. (T-2) 3.5.3.  Senior  officers  will  be  considered  in  a  formal  training  status  for  the  duration  of  the course.    Their  duties  will  be  turned  over  to  appropriate  deputy  commanders  or  vice commanders  until  training  is  completed.  Waiver  authority  for  this  paragraph  is  the MAJCOM/CC (submitted through the MAJCOM/A3). (T-2) AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 19 Chapter 4 CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  establishes  the  minimum  crewmember  training  requirements  to maintain BMC or MR for an assigned training status. The SQ/CC will ensure each crewmember receives sufficient training to maintain individual currency and proficiency (T-3). 4.2.  Crewmember Status.  SQ/CCs will assign ACD crewmembers a status using the following criteria: 4.2.1.  Mission  Ready  (MR).    A  status  that  denotes  a  crewmember  received  the  minimum training required to be certified, current, and proficient in all of the primary DOC statement mission requirements of their assigned or attached unit. 4.2.2.  Non-Mission  Ready  (NMR).  A  crewmember  that  is  unqualified,  non-current  or incomplete in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. 4.2.3.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC). A crewmember who satisfactorily completed IQT and MQT, but is not fully-certified to MR status. 4.2.3.1.  The  crewmember  shall  be  able  to  attain  full  unit  mission  certification  to  meet operational tasking within 30 days. (T-3) 4.2.3.2.  The OG/CC may  define a portion of the unit’s operational  mission and declare an assigned or attached crewmember MR if all training requirements for that part of the operational  mission  are  met.  The  crewmember  does  not  need  to  attain  full  mission certification unless directed by the OG/CC. (T-3) 4.2.4.  MR and BMC crewmembers will accomplish and/or maintain RCP requirements, for their respective status, and the appropriate events in the RCP tables in this Instruction and the RTM. (T-3) 4.3.  Training  Events/Tables.  Standardized  training  events  identifiers  and  descriptions  are located in Attachment 2. Units will include unit-specific events to include a description in their local training documentation. (T-3) 4.3.1.  Crediting Event Accomplishment. Credit events accomplished on training, operational missions and satisfactory evaluations or certifications toward RCP requirements and establish a subsequent due date. Use date of successful evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all  mission-related  training  events  that  were  trained  during  a  formal  course.  A  successful evaluation establishes a new current and qualified reference date for all accomplished events. For training during IQT or requalification training, numbers of events accomplished prior to the  evaluation  are  not  credited  to  any  crew  position.  In  all  cases,  numbers  of  events successfully accomplished during the evaluation or certification are credited toward the crew position. (T-3) 4.3.2.  For an unsatisfactory evaluation, do not log CT requirements for those events graded U/Q3 (according to AFI 17-202V2) until re-qualified. (T-3) 4.3.3.  Instructors and evaluators may credit up to 50 percent of their total CT requirements while instructing or evaluating. (T-3) 20 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 4.4.  Continuation  Training  Requirements.  Completion and tracking of continuation training is  ultimately  the  responsibility  of  the  individual  crewmember.  Crewmembers  should  actively work  with  their  supervisors,  unit  schedulers  and  training  offices  to  ensure  accomplishment  of their continuation training requirements. (T-3) 4.4.1.  Mission-Related  Training  Events.  Crewmembers  will  comply  with  requirements  of Table 4.1. Failure to accomplish events in Table 4.1 leads to NMR status.  (T-3) 4.4.2.  Weapons and Tactics Academic Training.  Units will establish a  weapons and tactics academic training program to satisfy MQT and CT requirements. Training is required semi-annually during each training cycle. SQ/CCs will provide guidance to unit weapons shops to ensure all crewmembers are informed/reminded of new/current ACD weapons, systems, and mission-specific  TTPs.  The  program  will  require  successful  completion  of  an  open  book examination  (80  percent  minimum  to  pass).  Unit  training  offices  will  track  completion  of tactics training. Failure to attend tactics training will result in NMR status. (T-3) 4.4.3.  Instruction and tests should include (as applicable), but are not limited to: 4.4.3.1.  Applicable  AF  Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedure  (AFTTP)  3-1  &  3-3  series publications, AFI 17-2ACD Volume 3, and other documents pertaining to the execution of the unit’s mission. (T-3) 4.4.3.2.  Specialized  training  to  support  specific  weapons,  tactics,  mission  capabilities, rules of engagement (ROE), and other mission related activities. (T-3) 4.4.4.  CT Certification. CT Certification updates crew members on their squadron's wartime mission. Each MR crew member will participate in a squadron CT certification as a briefer, board member, or participant every 18 months. BMC crew members should participate in a CT  Certification  to  facilitate  future  upgrade  to  MR  status,  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC. Crew members who participate on the certification board receive credit for CT Certification. (T-3) 4.4.5.  Risk  Management  (RM).  Crew  members  will  participate  in  RM  training  once  every training  cycle.    Briefings  will  include  the  concepts  outlined  in  AFPAM  90-803,  Risk Management  (RM)  Guidelines  and  Tools.  Unit  training  offices  will  track  RM  training. Failure to attend RM training will result in NMR status. (T-3) Table 4.1.  ACD Crew Mission-Related CT Requirements.

Failure to complete this event within the time prescribed leads to NMR status.  Crewmembers will not be able to accomplish unsupervised crew duties until the delinquent event is accomplished or waived.   Frequency  Notes 179d 18m 365d AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 21 4.4.6.  Mission  Training  Events.  Crewmembers  will  comply  with  requirements  of  the  RTM for their respective position. Total sorties and events are minimums which ensure training to continually  meet  all  DOC  tasked  requirements  and  may  not  be  reduced  except  in proration/waiver.  Unless  specifically  noted  the  OG/CC  is  the  waiver  authority  for  all  RCP requirements and for all provisions in  Chapter  4 and  Chapter  5 of this volume. Failure to accomplish events in these tables may lead to NMR status. (T-3) 4.5.  Specialized Mission Training.  Training in any special skills (e.g., tactics, weapon system capabilities,  responsibilities,  etc.)  necessary  to  carry  out  the  unit's  assigned  mission  that  is  not required  by  every  crewmember.  Specialized  training  consists  of  upgrade  training  such  as instructor  etc.,  as  well  as  CT  to  maintain  certification,  currency,  and  proficiency  in  unit  tasked special capabilities and missions. (T-3) 4.5.1.  Specialized  training  is  normally  accomplished  after  a  crewmember  is  assigned MR/BMC  status  and  is  normally  in  addition  to  MR/BMC  requirements  except  for  Mission Commander  (MC)  training.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  crewmembers  in  MR  or  BMC positions  may  hold  special  mission  certifications  as  long  as  any  additional  training requirements are accomplished. (See Chapter 5) (T-3) 4.5.2.  The  SQ/CC  will determine  and  assign  crewmembers  that  will  train  for  and  maintain special mission qualifications and certifications. (T-3) 4.6.  Multiple  Qualification/Currency.  See  AFI  17-202V1,  AFI  17-202V2,  applicable  HHQ guidance, and AFI 17-2ACD Volume 2, Air Force Cyberspace Defense (ACD) Standardization and Evaluation, for multiple qualifications. 4.6.1.  Multiple  qualifications  are  not  appropriate  for  senior  wing  supervisors  (OG/CD  and above). (T-2) 4.6.2.  Multiple  Requirements.  Crewmembers  will  satisfy  at  least  50  percent  of  the  sortie requirements  in  their  primary  weapon  system.  If  MR,  they  will  meet  all  RCP  mission  and event requirements of the primary weapon system. (T-3) 4.6.3.  Multiple  Currencies.  Crewmembers  will  conduct  a  sortie  at  least  once  each  45  days (90  days  for  ARC  crewmembers)  in  each  weapon  system.  They  will  comply  with  all  other currency requirements for each weapon system. (T-3) 4.6.4.  Multiple  qualified  crewmembers  must  complete  training  IAW  the  approved  syllabus for each weapon system. (T-3) 4.7.  Currencies, Proficiency and Requalification. 4.7.1.  Currency.  The  RTM  defines  currency  requirements  for  BMC/MR  crewmembers. Crewmembers  may  not  instruct,  evaluate  or  perform  any  event  in  which  they  are  not qualified  and  current  unless  under  instructor  supervision.  Currency  may  be  established  or updated by: 4.7.1.1.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  provided  member’s currency has not expired. (T-3) 4.7.1.2.  Accomplishing  the  event  as  a  qualified  crewmember  under  supervision  of  a current instructor. (T-3) 4.7.1.3.  Satisfactorily performing events on any evaluation. (T-3) 22 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 4.7.2.  If a crewmember loses a specific currency, thereby requiring recurrency, that mission or  event  may  not  be  performed  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining  currency.  Non-current events  must  be  satisfied  before  the  crewmember  is  considered  certified/qualified  (as applicable)  to  perform  those  events  unsupervised.  Loss  of  currencies  affecting  MR  status require  regression  to  NMR  (see  paragraph  4.9);  loss  of  currencies  not  affecting  MR  status does not require regression. (T-3) 4.8.  Loss of Instructor Status and Requalification/Recurrency. 4.8.1.  Instructors may lose instructor status for the following: 4.8.1.1.  Loss of currency for more than 180 days. (T-3) 4.8.1.2.  Instructors become noncurrent in a mission or event which causes removal from MR/BMC status and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require complete decertification (but not a complete loss of qualification). (T-3) 4.8.1.2.1.  As  long  as  the  affected  crewmember  retains  instructor  qualification  IAW AFI 17-202V2, recertification will be at the SQ/CC’s discretion. (T-3) 4.8.1.2.2.  If the SQ/CC does not elect to decertify the individual or if the individual becomes  noncurrent  in  missions  or  events  which  do  not  require  removal  from  MR status,  instructor  status  may  be  retained,  but  the  instructor  will  not  instruct  that mission or event until the required currency is regained. (T-3) 4.8.2.  Instructor  Lack  of  Ability.  Instructors  serve  solely  at  the  discretion  of  the  SQ/CC. Instructors should exemplify a higher level of performance and present themselves as reliable and authoritative experts in their respective duty positions. Instructors exhibiting substandard performance should be reviewed for suitability of continued instructor duty. (T-3) Instructors will be decertified if: 4.8.2.1.  Awarded a less than fully qualified grade in any area of the evaluation regardless of overall crewmember position qualification. (T-3) 4.8.2.2.  They fail an evaluation. (T-3) 4.8.2.3.  The  SQ/CC  deems  the  instructor  is  substandard,  ineffective,  or  providing incorrect procedures, techniques, or policy guidance. (T-3) 4.8.2.4.  Decertified  instructors  may  regain  instructor  status  by  correcting  applicable deficiencies and completing the training and/or evaluation as specified by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.9.  Regression. 4.9.1.  BMC/MR Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. Only RCP training missions and cyberspace  operations  sorties  may  be  used  for  lookback.  If  a  crewmember  does  not  meet lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CC can: regress the crewmember to NMR/N-BMC,  as  applicable,  or  remove  the  crewmember  from  a  BMC/MR  manning position. (T-3)   AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 23 4.9.1.1.  Failure  to  meet  1-month  lookback  requires  a  review  of  the  crewmember’s  3-month  sortie  history.  If  the  3-month  lookback  is  met,  the  crewmember  may,  at  SQ/CC discretion, remain in MR/BMC status. Failure to meet the 3-month lookback will result in regression  to  NMR/N-BMC,  as  applicable,  or  the  crewmember  may  be  placed  in probation  status  for  1  month  at  the  SQ/CC's  discretion.  If  probation  is  chosen,  the  only way  to  remove  a  crewmember  from  probation  and  preserve  the  current  status  is  to reestablish a 1-month lookback at the end of the probation period. (T-3) 4.9.1.2.  Lookback computations begin following completion of MQT. The crewmember must  maintain  1-month  lookback  until  3-month  lookback  is  established.  SQ/CCs  may apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.9.1.1 if a new MR/BMC crewmember fails  to  meet  1-month  lookback  while  establishing  3-month  lookback.  In  addition,  1-month lookback will start the first full month of MR/BMC status. (T-3) 4.9.2.  Regression for Failed Evaluations.  Crewmembers who fail a periodic evaluation are unqualified  and  will  regress  to  NMR/N-BMC  as  applicable.  Crewmembers  will  remain NMR/N-BMC  until  they  have  successfully  completed  required  corrective  action,  re-evaluation, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.9.3.  Failure  to  Maintain  Standards.  If  a  qualified  crewmember  demonstrates  lack  of proficiency or knowledge the SQ/CC may elect to regress the individual to NMR/M-BMC as applicable.    These  crewmembers  will  remain  NMR/N-BMC  until  successful  completion  of corrective action as determined by the SQ/CC, an evaluation if required and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 4.10.  End  of  Cycle  Requirements.  Crewmembers  who  fail  to  complete  mission  or  event requirements by the end of training cycle may require additional training depending on the type and  magnitude  of  the  deficiency.  Refer  to  paragraph  4.11  for  proration  guidance.  In  all  cases, units will report training shortfalls to the OG/CC. (T-3) 4.10.1.  Crewmembers  failing  to  meet  annual  RCP  events  or  minimum  total  sortie requirements  may  continue  CT  at  MR/BMC  as  determined  by  lookback.  The  SQ/CC  will determine if additional training is required. (T-3) 4.10.2.  Failure to meet specific BMC and MR mission type requirements will result in one of the following: 4.10.2.1.  Regression  to  NMR/N-BMC  if  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  mission  type deficiency  is  significant.  To  regain  MR/BMC,  the  crewmember  will  complete  all deficient  mission  types.  These  missions  may  also  be  counted  toward  the  total requirements for the new training cycle. (T-3) 4.10.2.2.  Continuation at  BMC/MR if total  RCP missions and lookback  are maintained and  the  mission  type  deficiencies  are  deemed  insignificant  by  the  SQ/CC.  The  SQ/CC will determine if any additional training is required to address shortfalls. (T-3) 4.10.3.  Failure  to  accomplish  missions/events  required  for  Special  Mission  capabilities  or certifications/qualifications  will  result  in  loss  of  that  certification/qualification.  The  SQ/CC will  determine  recertification  requirements.  Requalification  requirements  are  IAW  AFI  17-202V2, applicable HHQ guidance, and AFI 17-2ACD V2. (T-3)  24 AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 4.11.  Proration of Training. 4.11.1.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle the SQ/CC may prorate any training requirements precluded by the following events: initial arrival date in squadron, emergency leave, non-mission temporary duty (TDY) (i.e., PME) or exercises, or  deployments.    Ordinary  annual  leave  will  not  be  considered  as  non-availability.  Other extenuating  circumstances,  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC,  that  prevent  crewmembers  from mission duties for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered as non-availability for proration purposes. The following guidelines apply: 4.11.1.1.  Proration will not be used to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-3) 4.11.1.2.  Proration is based on cumulative days of non-availability for mission duties in the training cycle. Use Table 4.2 to determine the number of months to be prorated based on each period of cumulative non-mission duty calendar days. (T-3) 4.11.1.3.  If  IQT  or  MQT  is  re-accomplished,  a  crewmember’s  training  cycle  will  start over at a prorated share following completion of IQT/MQT. (T-3) 4.11.1.4.  No requirement may be prorated below one month. Prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 month will be rounded to the next lower whole number (one or greater). (T-3) 4.11.1.5.  Newly assigned crewmembers achieving MR/BMC after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration purposes. A prorated share of RCP missions must be completed in CT. (T-3) 4.11.1.6.  A crewmember’s last month on station prior to departing PCS may be prorated provided  1  month's  proration  is  not  exceeded.  Individuals  departing  PCS  may  be considered  MR  for  reporting  purposes  during  a  period  of  60  days  from  date  of  last mission/sortie, or until loss of MR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station, whichever occurs first. (T-3) 4.11.1.7.  MR crewmembers who attend the USAFWS in TDY-and-return status may be reported throughout the TDY as MR. Upon return, those crewmembers will accomplish a prorated share of mission and event requirements. (T-3) 4.12.  Operational  Missions.  The  following  procedures  are  intended  to  provide  flexibility  in accomplishing the unit's CT program. Sorties conducted in support of operations will be logged and  count  toward  annual  RCP  requirements  for  lookback  purposes.  Operational  missions  and events  may  be  used  to  update  proficiency/currency  requirements  if  they  meet  the  criteria  in Attachment 2. (T-3) 4.12.1.  Example:  Capt  Jones  was  granted  17  days  of  emergency  leave  in  January  and attended SOS in residence from March through April for 56 consecutive calendar days. The SQ/CC  authorized  a  total  of  two  months  proration  from  his  training  cycle  (two  months  for the 73 cumulative days of non-availability).   AFI17-2ACDV1  27 APRIL 2017 25 Table 4.2.  Proration Allowance. CUMULATIVE DAYS OF NON-MISSION ACTIVITY  0 – 15 16 – 45  46 – 75  76 – 105  106 – 135  136 – 165 166 – 195 196 – 225  226 – 255  256 – 285  286 – 315  316 – 345  Over 345  PRORATION ALLOWED (Months) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4.13.  Regaining BMC/MR Status. 4.13.1.  If MR/BMC status is lost due to failure to meet the end of cycle event requirements, re-certification/re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.10. (T-3) 4.13.2.  If MR/BMC status is  lost  due to failure to  meet  lookback  IAW paragraph 4.10, the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember was removed from MR/BMC status): 4.13.2.1.  Up  to  90  Days.  Complete  a  SQ/CC  approved  recertification  program (documented in  the individual’s training folder)  to  return the crewmember to  MR/BMC standards.  Upon  completion  of  the  recertification  program,  the  MR/BMC  crewmember must  also  meet  the  subsequent  1-month  lookback  requirement  prior  to  reclaiming MR/BMC  status.  The  missions  and  events  accomplished  during  the  recertification program may be credited towards their total/type mission and event requirements for the training  cycle  as  well  as  for  their  monthly  mission  requirement.  In  addition,  all  RCP event currencies must be regained. The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to MR recertification. (T-3) 4.13.2.2.  91-180 Days. Same as above, plus open/closed book qualification examinations (IAW  AFI  17-202V2).    Open/closed  book  exams  will  be  documented  IAW  AFI  17-202V2. (T-3) 4.13.2.3.  181  Days  and  Beyond.  Reaccomplish  a  SQ/CC-directed  MQT  program  to include  a  formal  MSN  evaluation  IAW  AFI  17-202V2,  applicable  HHQ  guidance,  and AFI 17-2ACD V2.
