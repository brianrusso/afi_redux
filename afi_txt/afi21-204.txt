Broad  guidance  on  nuclear  weapon  stockpile  quantities  is  provided  by  various documents  (e.g.  New  START,  Presidential  Decision  Directives,  Nuclear  Posture  Review, etc.).    The  DoD  and  DoE  prepare,  coordinate,  and  deliver  the  Nuclear  Weapons  Stockpile Memorandum  (NWSM),  which  contains  the  Nuclear  Weapons  Stockpile  Plan  (NWSP),  to the  President.    The  President  then  signs  a  NWSP  which  directs  quantities  and  types  of nuclear  weapons  in  the  active  and  inactive  stockpile.    The  President,  through  the  SECDEF and  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  entrusts  the  stockpile  to  various  Services  for employment  as  requested/directed  by  combatant  commanders  (e.g.  USSTRATCOM, EUCOM), based on their missions and use in executing the war plans. 3.1.2.  Units  are  to  maintain  sufficient  spare  Reentry  Systems,  ALCM  launcher/pylons  to support  operational  requirements.    These  systems  are  in  addition  to  OPLAN  commitments.  Spare  systems  may  be  rotated  into  the  missile  field  to  enhance  flexibility  of  the  wing’s maintenance schedule. 3.1.3.  NCP is the Service Logistics Agent (SLA) for all nuclear weapons assigned to the Air Force.    They  ensure  stockpile  quantities  align  with  the  NWSM,  and  are  available  to  meet mission  requirements,  logistics  plans,  and  other  stockpile  management  requirements  using the  following  methods:  directing  inspections  and  maintenance  of  nuclear  weapons  and/or components  within  the  scope  of  approved  technical  procedures;  scheduling  weapon movements  through the  NOSS to  ensure all weapons are  at  the proper location in  adequate quantities;  providing and replenishing logistics spare warheads/bombs  to  units;  determining the best storage locations for active, inactive, and retired weapons; and directing charge code changes  through  either  the  NOSS  or  other  means  (e.g.,  SLT/SFT  Warning  Orders/Material Transfer  Order  (MTO)).    Note:    NCP  will  request  all  MTO  from  DTRA  using  the  NOSS module or MTO request module in DIAMONDS. 3.1.4.  NCP  provides  logistics  spare  warheads/bombs  to  units  in  excess  of  operational requirement  quantities.    Logistics  spare  warheads/bombs  may  be  in  various  stages  of assembly  and  LLCs  do  not  need  to  be  installed.    Logistics  spare  warheads/bombs  may  be mated to launch gear to enhance flexibility of the wing’s operational/generation capability. 3.1.5.  NCP,  in  coordination  with  DTRA  SLA,  is  responsible  for  maintenance  management of retired weapons in AF custody. 3.2.  Management of Nuclear Components. 3.2.1.  Units will develop their proposed fiscal year LLC support schedule using template in Figure  3-1,  and  forward  to  their  parent  MAJCOM  for  approval  NLT  1  February.    (T-1).  MAJCOMs  will  validate  and  forward  proposed  fiscal  year  LLC  support  schedules  to  NCP NLT  1  March.    NCP  will  coordinate  with  MAJCOMs  as  necessary  to  adjudicate  support schedules,  and  forward  proposed  AF  LLC  support  requirements  to  DTRA  NLT  1  April.  Once approved by DTRA, the fiscal year LLC support schedule becomes final.  Subsequent   16  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 change  requests  are  submitted  and  approved  IAW  paragraphs  2.2.1.1  or  2.2.1.2  of  this instruction. 3.2.1.1.  Replacement  LLCs  are  force  shipped  to  Air  Force  units  (as  scheduled  in  the approved fiscal year support schedule) having custody of weapons to allow maintenance actions  to  be  accomplished  prior  to  LLC  expiration  dates.  Units  may  complete  LLC exchanges  any  time  after  LLC  support  arrives.    Units,  through  parent  MAJCOMs,  may request  changes  to  the  fiscal  year  LLC  support  schedule  from  NCP.    Change  requests should  be  submitted  as  early  as  practicable,  but  NLT  90  calendar  days  prior  to  needed delivery month.  Changes are sequentially numbered, and submitted using the template in Figure 3.1, with proposed changes highlighted. 3.2.1.2.  Requests for  LLC support based on any  reason other than  LLC expiration date requires  approval  by  DTRA  (unless  approved  within  fiscal  year  LLC  support  schedule outlined  in  paragraph  3.2.1).  Units,  through  parent  MAJCOMs,  forward  requests  to NCP. Requirements for timely return of expired LLCs detailed in TO 11N-100-2, Supply Management of Limited Life Components, still apply. 3.2.2.  NCP may co-locate LLCs at operational bases to meet readiness timelines. 3.3.  Management of Containers and Bolsters. 3.3.1.

Certification,  as  used  here,  is  a  term  that  applies  to  nuclear  weapons  maintenance, mate/demate and handling operations.  The certification program  is  a requirement over  and above  the  qualification  and  certification  procedures  contained  in  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force Training Program, and AFI 36-2650, Maintenance Training, and takes precedence over all other publications in the area of nuclear weapons certification and evaluation. AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   21  4.4.1.1.  The purpose of the certification program is threefold: 4.4.1.1.1.  All certifications are conducted using nuclear weapons trainers. 4.4.1.1.2.  Technicians performing nuclear weapons tasks understand and use proper technical data, maintenance procedures, and techniques. 4.4.1.1.3.  Only certified technicians are permitted to perform nuclear weapons tasks (maintenance, mate/demate and handling) on WR weapons. 4.4.2.  Technicians must complete weapons academic training, applicable safety training, and be JQS task qualified prior to task certification. 4.4.3.  Certification is limited to those items on which the technician is qualified. 4.5.  Certifying Officials.  (For tasks identified in paragraph 4.8). 4.5.1.  The senior nuclear weapons technician (2W2XX) assigned, 2WX7X QA and 2M07X QA are nuclear weapons certifying officials by virtue of position and need not be appointed.  If  necessary,  the  OO/MX  SUPT  may  appoint,  in  writing,  additional  technically  qualified certifying officials for the following tasks: 4.5.1.1.  2M052 for RS mate/demate and weapons handling tasks. 4.5.1.2.  2M07X for select mate/demate tasks, and weapons handling tasks. 4.5.1.3.  2WX71 for weapons handling tasks. 4.5.1.4.  2W271 for weapons maintenance, mate/demate and handling tasks. 4.5.2.  Personnel  assigned  Certifying  Official  responsibilities  as  defined  in  this  AFI  will  be JQS  qualified  on  the  specific  nuclear  weapons,  weapons  systems,  nuclear  reporting,  CDS, and PAL/CMS procedures as they apply to the task being evaluated.  The individual must be capable of accurately observing job performance and identifying deviation from established standards. 4.5.3.  Prior to performing certifications, the QA superintendent, Chief Inspector, MX/SUPT, or Flight Commander/Flight Chief will ensure Certifying Officials are JQS qualified on the task  to  be  evaluated  and  have  a  current  Evaluator  Proficiency  Evaluation  (EPE)  while performing  a  personnel  evaluation  (PE).    All  certifying  officials  must  receive  a  semiannual EPE on a PE.  If a certifying official is overdue the semiannual personnel EPE, the individual is  restricted  from  performing  certifications  until  another  EPE  is  completed.    QA  maintains initial and current EPE documentation for all certifying officials. 4.5.4.  Certifying Officials will not certify themselves. 4.5.5.  Certifications  will  only  be  accomplished  while  observing  actual  task  performance.  Certifying Officials will not be part of the task being performed. 4.5.6.  Certify  technicians  to  perform  or  direct  nuclear  weapons  maintenance,  mate/demate and  ,  transfer  tasks  as  TC,  TM,  Work  Cage  (WC),  Diving  Board  (DB),  or  Top  Side  (TS).  Technicians certified in the TC position may perform as TMs.  Technicians must perform the entire operation to include all documentation required for the task. 4.5.7.  Certify  technicians  to  perform  transport  tasks.    All  personnel  certified  on  transport tasks must be able to demonstrate the use and application of all associated technical data.   22  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 4.5.8.  Certify  weapons  maintenance  tasks  by  weapon  type  and  task  performed  (e.g.,  B61 General Maintenance (GM), B61 LLCE, etc.). 4.5.9.  Separate  certification  is  not  required  for  nose  and  tail  removals,  LLC  removal, Parachute (PC) removal, weapon demate from launch gear and equipment, demate RV, RV disassembly, demate aft shroud, or RS demate from MGS, provided the individual is certified on  the  applicable  installation,  mate,  or  assembly  procedure  and  is  appropriately  JQS qualified. 4.5.10.  CDS recodes, activation, and Strike Enable Plug (SEP) removal or installation do not require certification.  Individuals need be JQS qualified only. 4.5.11.  H1616, H1700 and 9-gallon drum operations do not require certification.  Individuals need be JQS qualified only. 4.5.12.  PAL/CMS  TMs  do  not  require  certification;  individuals  need  be  JQS  qualified  and the training must be documented in the CFETP, TBA, or other authorized document/system.  PAL/CMS  TMs  are  authorized  to  open  and  close  access  doors,  connect/disconnect PAL/CMS  cables  and  adapters,  and  perform  visual  monitors  provided  these  items  are included in PAL/CMS training. 4.5.13.  Personnel involved in a one-time handling and movement of non-assigned weapons such as PNAF divert, DoE SAFE HAVENs, etc., must be transfer and/or transport certified and qualified to operate required equipment (tow vehicle, forklift, etc.) needed to support the mission.  Technicians do not require JQS qualification on non-assigned weapons.  This is the only exception to normal nuclear weapons  certification and JQS qualification requirements.  Personnel  involved  in  a  one-time  handling  and  movement  of  non-assigned  weapons  must have  current  technical  data  available  and  they  must  review  and  understand  the  procedures prior to operation. 4.6.  Certification Requirements. 4.6.1.  Weapons  maintenance,  mate/demate  and  handling  certifications  will  be  performed using the following guidelines: 4.6.1.1.  Certifications  may  involve  any  procedures  that  are  authorized  to  be  performed by  that  certification  IAW  paragraph  4.8    Certifying  officials  should  vary  what  is demonstrated from certification to certification and limit “standardized certifications” as much as possible to prevent technicians from being “trained for the certification.” 4.6.1.2.  Abbreviated  operations  for  the  purposes  of  recertifying  personnel  are  not authorized.    Additionally,  multiple  TC  certifications  must  be  performed  as  separate, complete  start-to-finish  operations  (i.e.  one  TC  will  not  disassemble  the  weapon  and  a second TC reassemble it). 4.6.1.3.  All certifications will include a sufficient number of exercise injects in the form of  defect  analysis  and  written  situational  scenarios  to  provide  the  certifying  official  an accurate assessment of the scope and completeness of training and the crew’s proficiency during  actual  task  performance.    Certifying  officials  will  avoid  an  excessive  number  of injects  during  the  evaluation.    The  number  of  inject  scenarios  per  certification  will  be coordinated through OO/MX SUPT and spelled out  in  the Maintenance Standardization & Evaluation Program (MSEP). AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   23  4.6.1.3.1.  Inject  scenarios  will  exercise  the  team’s  ability  to  manage  or  respond  to emergency  situations,  detect  and  properly  evaluate  defects,  and  their  in-depth knowledge of all technical data procedures applicable to that certification. 4.6.1.3.2.  Each  GM  and  LLCE  TC  certification  will  involve  at  least  one  inject scenario driving the initiation of a UR against the weapon to verify the crew’s ability to generate accurate reports. 4.6.1.4.  A certification is considered a normal evaluation in regards to all the evaluation rules  provided  in  AFI  21-200  with  the  exception  that  certifications  will  not  be  counted against QA’s required PE totals in the QA database.  All certifications will be scored and documented  as  “Non-Rated”  tasks  regardless  of  whether  or  not  it  was  a  pass  or  fail certification.  Follow established Group routing procedures for certification reports. 4.6.1.4.1.  Certifications  may  be  rated  "fail"  even  if  established  Acceptable  Quality Levels  (AQL)  are  not  exceeded,  based  on  the  Certifying  Officials  assessment  of technical proficiency.  Certification attempts that are not successful will be treated as training  operations  and  documented  as  a  non-rated  evaluation.    The  evaluation  will not be scored against established inspection and evaluation requirements. 4.6.1.4.2.  A separate PE will be scored on certified personnel who are on a crew with an individual undergoing a certification.  The PE may be captured on the same report as  the  initial  certification  provided  the  QA  database  allows  for  individual pass/fail/non-rated  ratings.    In  this  case,  the  overall  report  will  be  indicated  as pass/fail and the individuals undergoing the initial  certification will have a rating of non-rated.  In addition, if the certified personnel commit an error, series of errors, or did  not  detect  an  error  committed  by  others  that  they  were  in  a  position  to  have detected, they themselves may be decertified using the guidance in this chapter. 4.6.1.4.3.  Decertification  rules  provided  in  this  chapter  will  apply  when  a  certified TM  commits  errors  while  undergoing  a  TC  upgrade  certification.    As  a  result  of failing  the  TC  upgrade  certification,  the  technician  will  also  be  decertified  as  a  TM based on their committed error(s). 4.6.1.5.  If decertified on either transfer or transport, subsequent recertification will occur on the specific operation the individual was performing when decertified. 4.7.  Certification Documentation. 4.7.1.  Record certifications and proficiency checks on AF IMT 2435 or approved equivalent.  Because of the critical  nature of the certification and to  avoid  conflicting certification data, the AF IMT 2435 is to be used as a stand-alone document to validate current certification and proficiency  checks  of  tasks  identified  in  paragraph  4.8    Although  documentation  of  JQS qualification  is  required  prior  to  certification,  a  discrepancy  with  JQS  qualifications  and certification dates does not invalidate certifications.  The certifying official's signature on the AF  IMT  2435,  is  the  formal  act  of  certification.    No  alterations  to  entries  are  authorized.  Automated systems may be used to monitor certifications and recurring proficiency checks.  Approved  automated  systems  may  be  used  to  verify/validate  certifications.    Use  Figure  4.1 and Figure 4.2 as a guide.   24  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 4.7.2.  Complete  the  AF  IMT  2435  in  ink  or  type-written  except  when  use  of  pencil  is indicated below: 4.7.2.1.  Blocks  1-4,  self-explanatory  (Block  2,  enter  grade  or  enlisted/officer,  maybe completed in pencil). 4.7.2.2.  Blocks 5-6, not applicable. 4.7.2.3.  Block 7; enter weapon type and task as listed in paragraph 4.8 or as directed by MAJCOM.    Enter  “TC”,  “TM”,  “TS”,  “WC”  or  “DB”  for  appropriate  team  position.  Note:  Units may list JQS qualifications to explain certification, if listed, the form maybe used as a single source document for validating scope of certification before dispatching personnel.  An example would be to include all trailer qualifications, MHU-141, MHU-196, 40 Foot trailer, etc, under “Transport”. 4.7.2.4.  Blocks 8-11, self-explanatory. 4.7.2.5.  Block 12; enter the information from block 7 plus the current year.  Enter a “C” for certified, a “P” for proficiency checks, a “D” for decertification, or an “X” (in pencil) for proficiency check due date, under the corresponding month, year, and task. 4.7.2.6.  Transcribe AF  IMT 2435 by copying the applicable information from Blocks 1 through 8 and Block 12 of the old form to the new form.  Enter "Transcribed" in Block 11 of the new form.  Flight Chief or above enters a statement on the new form attesting to the  accuracy  of  the  transcribed  entries  (see  Figure  4.1)  then  signs  his/her  name,  enters rank and dates the entry.  Destroy original AF IMT 2435. 4.7.2.6.1.  Carry  forward  the  last  proficiency  check  or  certification  date  (if  no proficiency  checks  have  been  performed  since  certification)  accomplished  for  each certified task. 4.7.2.6.2.  Due to decertification then subsequent recertification, if the recertification date of any prerequisite task (i.e., B61 GM, 4 Dec 13) is after the certification date(s) for  any  subsequent  tasks  (i.e.,  B61  LLC,  12  Jul  13),  enter  the  original  GM certification date (5 Jul 13) in block 8 on the line as the task.  Enter the recertification date on the line immediately below the original date.  The word TRANSCRIBED will be  placed  in  block  11  on  the  same  line  as  the  recertification  date.    In  this  case, proficiency checks do not need to be carried forward. 4.7.3.  Section/Element  NCOIC,  Flight  Chief,  OO/MX  SUPT  or  higher  will  decertify individuals for the following reasons: 4.7.3.1.  Failure to perform required proficiency check. 4.7.3.2.  Failure  to  demonstrate  required  technical  proficiency.    Demonstrating  lack  of technical proficiency to such a degree that the task being evaluated cannot be completed without  direct  supervisory  intervention.    This  does  not  include  abnormal  conditions requiring supervisory assistance. 4.7.3.3.  Failure  to  use  the  required  technical  data  during  weapons  maintenance, mate/demate or  handling tasks (e.g., no book or checklist or wrong book or checklist). 4.7.3.4.  Technicians  failed  to  detect  a  safety  or  reliability  deficiency  in  the  weapon, component, or support equipment. AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   25  4.7.3.5.  Upon upgrade certification to the TC position, decertify the individual from the TM position if certified in a TM position on the same task. 4.7.3.6.  Committing  procedural  errors  that,  if  not  corrected,  would  likely  result  in  an unreliable weapon, unsafe environment, or insecure environment.  This includes violation of weapon system safety rules.   26  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 Figure 4.1.  Sample AF IMT 2435, Load Training and Certification Document (Front).  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   27  Figure 4.2.  Sample AF IMT 2435, Load Training and Certification Document (Back).    28  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 4.8.  Certifiable Tasks. 4.8.1.  Weapons Maintenance. 4.8.1.1.  General  Maintenance  (GM).   This  task  includes  receipt  inspection,  verification inspection,  preparation  for  strike,  preparation  for  storage,  preparation  for  shipment, sealing  warhead  container,  bomb  nose  and/or  tail  removal/installation  and  transferring items to/from maintenance stands, alternate storage containers or out-of-container storage configuration.  It also includes movement by hand of weapon/RS and stacking/bolstering operations. 4.8.1.1.1.  GM  certification  allows to  perform  any  authorized maintenance,  other  than  parachute  exchange,  not  entailing  disassembly  of  the warhead  (e.g.,  removal  of  a  major  bulkhead  or  pressure  cover  allowing  access  to internal components). technicians 4.8.1.1.2.  GM  certification  is  required  prior  to  certification  on  any  other  weapons maintenance  task.    When  GM  certification  is  a  prerequisite  for  certification  on  any other  task,  it  is  specifically  identified  in  the  task  description.    GM  or  LGM certification  is  not  required  for  any  weapons  handling  task.    When  technicians upgrade  from  TM to  TC position, GM or  LGM,  as applicable must be the first  task upgraded. 4.8.1.1.3.  Decertification on GM does not  necessarily require decertification  on any other  task(s).    However,  the  technician  will  not  perform  those  tasks  until  recertified on  GM.    Note:    TCs  decertified  on  GM  may  not  perform  in  a  TM  position  on  any other task on the same weapon system until recertified on GM. 4.8.1.2.  Limited  General  Maintenance  (LGM).    This  task  is  weapon  type  specific  and authorizes personnel to  perform any external maintenance required for GM certification except nose/tail removal or removal/installation of warhead to/from container. 4.8.1.3.  LLC  Exchange  (LLCE).  Certification to, removal/installation  of  all  LLCs  as  defined  in  the  applicable  Technical  Order  (except those  associated  with  Parachute  Exchanges  and  MK12A  NGs),  leak  tests  and  all disassembly not included in GM. includes,  but limited is  not 4.8.1.4.  Parachute  (PC)  Exchange.    Certification  allows  technicians  to  remove/install parachute. 4.8.1.5.  RV  Assemble. to assemble/disassemble a RV and install/remove NGs.  Separate certifications are required for MK12A and MK21.   RV  Assemble.  Certification  allows technician the 4.8.2.  Weapons Mate/Demate. 4.8.2.1.  Mate/Demate  RV.    Certification  allows  the  technician  to  install/remove  the  RS installation kit and mate/demate RV to or from the payload support.  Certification on one RV  type  is  required  and  JQS  qualification  on  the  others.    RV  mate  certification  on  one system certifies the individual on all provided they are GM certified on each warhead. AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   29  4.8.2.2.  Mate/Demate  Payload.    Certification  allows  the  technician  to  mate/demate  the payload to/from  ALCM  with  payload  GM  certification  and  appropriate  JQS qualifications. 4.8.2.3.  Mate/Demate  Pylon.    Certification  allows  the  technician  to  mate/demate  the ALCM to/from the pylon with appropriate JQS qualifications. 4.8.2.4.  Mate/Demate CSRL. 4.8.2.4.1.  Mate/Demate  Missile  to  CSRL.  Certification  allows  the  technician  to mate/demate the ALCM to/from to the CSRL with appropriate JQS qualifications. 4.8.2.5.  Mate/Demate  Rotary  Launcher  Assembly  (RLA).    Certification  allows  the technician  to  mate/demate  gravity  weapons  to/from  the  RLA  with  appropriate  weapon GM certification and JQS qualifications.  (Mate/demate certification on one gravity type is required with JQS qualification on any others.) 4.8.2.6.  Mate/Demate MHU-196/204. 4.8.2.7.  Mate/Demate Launcher to/from Load Frame. 4.8.2.8.  Mate/Demate Pylon to/from Load Frame. 4.8.2.9.  Mate/Demate  Aft  Shroud.  This  certification  allows to install/remove  the  aft  shroud  on  payload  support,  install/remove  v-band  clamp, install/remove  in-flight  disconnect  cable,  install/remove  v-band  clamp  thermal  covers, install/remove  in-flight  disconnect  thermal  cover,  install/remove  v-band  pressure cartridges, install/remove thruster assembly thermal covers, install/remove shroud release shield,  connect  or  disconnect  shroud  rocket  motor  in-flight  disconnect.  Certification  on one system MK12A or MK21 certifies technicians on both. technician the 4.8.2.10.  Mate/Demate  RS  to/from  Missile  Guidance  Set  (MGS).    Certification  allows the technician to install/remove the RS to/from the MGS in the Launch Facility to include all electrical checkouts.  2M0X2 technicians will be JQS qualified and position certified in the following team positions:  TM, diving board, and work cage. 4.8.2.10.1.  Workcage  position  certification  allows  the  technician  to  install/remove the RS. 4.8.2.10.2.  TC  and  Diving  Board  position  certification  allows  the  technician  to install/remove the RS and checkout electrical system. 4.8.3.  Weapons Handling.  Technicians are JQS qualified on each weapon type, trailer, lift vehicle, and tow vehicle type they are required to use or handle.  Certifiable tasks include the following: 4.8.3.1.  Transfer.  Certification  allows  a  technician  to  transfer  weapons  (excluding aircraft  loading  operations)  to/from  a  forklift,  jammer,  vehicle,  or  trailer/SGT  and install/remove tie-down devices within the limits of JQS qualifications.  This certification also  includes  transfer  of  RS  to/from  maintenance  stand.    Transfer  certified  technicians with  appropriate  JQS  qualifications  may  also  perform  visual  monitor/safety  checks, movement  by hand of weapon/RS, stacking/bolstering, in/out  of the WS3 and Weapons Maintenance  Truck  (WMT),  RS  into/out  of  pit  (primary  and  alternate  method),  and  RS   30  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 topside handling (certifications on one RS type is required and JQS qualification on the others). 4.8.3.1.1.  Movement  of  a  weapon  by  forklift/jammer  is  considered  a  transfer operation provided the  weapon is  not  moved from  one established exclusion area to another  (e.g.,  forklifting  a  weapon  off  of  a  staging  trailer  and  moving  to  a  second trailer for tie-down on the Hot Cargo Pad, forklifting an H1388 out of a storage igloo and up onto a trailer, or lifting an Overland Palletized Unit Shipper (OPUS) overpack with a forklift and transferring it onto an H1703). 4.8.3.2.  Transport.  Certification  allows  a  technician  to  perform  pre-  and  post-tow procedures,  visual  monitor/safety  checks,  and  operate  a  tow  vehicle  or  forklift transporting  nuclear  weapons  within  the  limits  of  JQS  qualifications.    Personnel  must have  a  valid  operator’s  permit  and  be  JQS  qualified  on  the  tow  vehicle  or  forklift checkout  and  operation,  trailer  checkout  and  pre-tow  inspections,  operating  tow  vehicle with  trailer,  and  post  tow  inspection  for  each  tow  vehicle  or  trailer  utilized.    Formal certification  is  only  required  on  first  tow  vehicle;  JQS  qualify  individuals  on  all subsequent vehicles/trailers. 4.8.3.2.1.  Transport  certification  does  not  authorize  an  individual  to  install/remove tiedown  devices,  however,  transport  certified  personnel  must  be  able  to  ensure  the load is secure and safe to transport. transport  certification, 4.8.3.2.2.  During the  operator  must  demonstrate  an understanding  of  and  ability  to  operate  all  levers,  switches,  gauges,  etc.    Operator must demonstrate proficiency in vehicle operation while towing a trailer.  Units will develop  a  course  to  test  the  operator’s  ability  to  turn  (right  and  left),  stop  in  an emergency, and back a loaded trailer. 4.8.3.2.3.  Certification is  accomplished using the largest,  fully loaded, transportable package.    If  an  individual  subsequently  qualifies  to  operate  a  larger  package,  a  new certification  for  that  operation  must  be  accomplished.    If  applicable,  include  CDS procedures as part of initial transport certification. 4.9.  Nuclear Weapons Proficiency Checks. 4.9.1.  Nuclear weapon proficiency checks are accomplished at least semi-annually for each certified task an individual is certified on. 4.9.2.  A  JQS  qualified  QA,  BC,  Critical  Task  Supervisor,  Section/Element  Supervisor,  or Flight Chief will conduct proficiency checks.  (T-1). 4.9.3.  Proficiency  checks  may  be  accomplished  during  maintenance  on  WR  weapons,  in conjunction with a PE or during a higher headquarters evaluation or inspection. 4.9.4.  Proficiency  checks  will  be  performed  on  positions  certified  (e.g.,  TC,  TM,  diving board, work cage, etc.). 4.9.5.  A  JQS  qualified  QA,  BC,  Critical  Task  Supervisor,  Section/Element  or  Flight  Chief must  ensure  proficiency  checks  are  accomplished  prior  to  the  end  of  the  sixth  month.    For example, the last proficiency checks for B-61 LLC was accomplished in July 2015, the next proficiency check must be accomplished NLT the last day of January 2016. AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   31  4.9.6.  Proficiency checks as it pertains to this publication are not synonymous with AFI 21-200  required  personnel  proficiency  evaluations  (PPEs).    A  proficiency  check  may  be considered/evaluated as a PPE if the member is performing in the position certified.   32  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 Chapter 5 NUCLEAR WEAPONS MAINTENANCE AND HANDLING POLICIES 5.1.  General  Policies.  The  policies  below  are  applicable  to  all  maintenance  personnel  who maintain, mate/demate, handle, checkout, or store nuclear weapons or TYPE 3 trainers.  If there is a conflict between the policies below and other directives notify the OPR of this publication for resolution. 5.1.1.  Maintenance Capability. 5.1.1.1.  All  levels  of  supervision  will  continually  monitor  shift  manning/scheduling, equipment  requirements,  and  will  effectively  schedule  additional  duties,  leave,  training and work details  to  provide maximum  capability and minimize work force degradation.  (T-3). 5.1.1.2.  Train  and  certify  sufficient  personnel  to  meet  mission  requirements  outlined  in the MCL.  Units are prohibited from performing WR maintenance when they are below their MCL minimums, Group commanders may waiver this requirement to meet mission needs.    However,  the  Group  commanders  must  notify  the  applicable  MAJCOM;  the notification  will  include  the  reason  for  falling  below  MCL,  actions  or  compensatory measures  that  are  in  place  to  minimize  the  impact  on  maintenance  and  a  projected  “get well”  date.    Also,  ensure  applicable  AFI  10-201,  Status  of  Resources  and  Training System, reporting is accomplished. 5.1.1.3.  LLCE and PC exchange certification is mandatory only if assigned weapons are within 3 months of required maintenance. 5.1.2.  Maintenance, Storage, and Configuration. 5.1.2.1.  Keep  nuclear  weapons  and  warheads  in  fully  assembled  configurations  except during maintenance or as otherwise directed by appropriate agencies or when allowed by Technical  Guidance  or  disposition  instructions.    Submit  requests  to  the  applicable MAJCOM for deviations to storage configurations. 5.1.2.2.  Store  nuclear  weapons  only  in  approved  structures  and  configurations,  IAW DoD 3150.02-M.   (T-0).  Do not  co-mingle nuclear and non-nuclear munitions/missiles (e.g.,  TYPE  trainers/shapes,  JTAs,  Training  Ferry  Payloads  (TFP),  empty  missile containers,  warhead  containers,  CALCM/ALCM  Test  Instrumentation  Kits  (CATIK), etc.) in the same storage structure, cell, or WS3.   (T-1).   Only as a last resort and with written  MAJCOM  approval  may  assets  be  co-mingled.    Personnel  will  ensure  all  non-nuclear  munitions/missiles  are  identified  using  stanchions/cones,  ropes,  and  placards  to ensure  there  is  a  clear  distinction  between  nuclear  and  non-nuclear  munitions/missiles.  Placards indicate “Trainer”, “Empty”, “JTA”, or “CATIK”, as applicable. 5.1.2.3.  Personnel  will  ensure  non-operational  weapons  are  identified  using  placards marked  “Non-Operational”.    (T-1).    Make  identification  readily  visible  and  do  not remove  until  the  status  is  changed  or  immediately  before  logistics  movement.    If  a storage  structure  or  cell  contains  all  non-operational  weapons  a  single  placard  may  be posted at the entrance indicating all weapons inside the storage structure or cell are non-operational.    It  is  not  necessary  to  open  a  vault  or  structure  solely  for  the  purpose  of AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   33  installing or removing a non-operational placard.  Personnel must establish an Awaiting Maintenance (AWM) action against the weapon to install or remove placard during next scheduled opening.  (T-2). 5.1.2.4.  Training and/or JTA and WR operations may take place at the same time as long as physical separation exists between operations.  Physical separation must include clear delineation  between  operations  using  stanchions/cones,  ropes,  and  placards.    Placards must  indicate  “Training”  or  “JTA  Operations”,  as  applicable.    In  USAFE,  concurrent operations with training and/or JTA and WR weapons are not authorized in a Protective Aircraft Shelter (PAS). 5.1.2.5.  Weapons  maintenance  will  have  sufficient  priority  to  ensure  objectives  in  T.O. 11N-100-2 are met. 5.1.2.6.  Nuclear  weapons  repair  actions  must  be  completed  as  soon  as  possible,  not  to exceed  30  duty  days  (CONUS)  and  60  duty  days  (OCONUS)  following  UR  and/or  DR disposition and/or receipt of required replacement parts.  Request waivers IAW Chapter 2 of this instruction. 5.1.2.7.  Cannibalization  or  interchanging  of  nuclear  weapon  components  is  not authorized unless directed in a technical order, UR, or by NCP. 5.1.2.8.  OCONUS  units  must  make  every  attempt  to  store  WR  weapons  in  a  Weapons Storage  Vault  (WSV)  at  the  end  of  the  duty  day.    (T-3).    If  a  weapon  cannot  be  fully reassembled,  or  cannot  be  returned  to  the  WSV  for  any  reason,  the  Group  commander may  authorize  temporary  storage  outside  of  the  WSV  as  a  last  resort.    Units  will  also notify USAFE/A10N immediately. 5.1.2.9.  Personnel may perform any inspection, test, or minor maintenance operation not involving  weapon  disassembly,  in  storage  structures,  vaults,  alert  areas,  or  generation areas.  Examples include fin replacement, access  door panel removal, coding operations and opening containers for inventory.  Request waivers to this paragraph IAW AFMAN 91-201, and the applicable WSSRs. 5.1.2.10.  Inspect  all  exposed  visible  surfaces  of  nuclear  weapons  during  a  maintenance technical operation IAW the applicable technical manuals.  (T-1). 5.1.2.11.  Evaluate all defects discovered during inspections.  (T-1). 5.1.2.11.1.  When rejectable defects are found, review IRCs to determine if the defect has been previously accepted. 5.1.2.11.2.  If  accepted  conditions  (defect  dimensions/description)  remain  the  same, no further action is required. 5.1.2.11.3.  If  the  accepted  conditions  have  changed  (defect  dimensions  have increased,  etc)  accept  or  reject  in  accordance  with  current  technical  guidance  and report as necessary. 5.1.2.12.  Store  and/or  mark  empty  weapon  storage  containers/hand  trucks  IAW  T.O. 11N-35-51, General Instructions Applicable to Nuclear Weapons.  (T-0). 5.1.2.13.  Nuclear  weapons  storage  locations  and  maintenance  bays  must  contain  a thermometer  if  the  types  of  weapons  stored  are  required  to  comply  with  weapon   34  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 temperature stabilization, refer to T.O., 11N-35-51 and the weapon’s -1 manual.   (T-0).  This includes weapons storage vaults and WMTs. 5.1.2.14.  In  nuclear  weapons  maintenance  facilities,  display  a  sign/placard  indicating Two-Person Concept is required (e.g., “No-Lone Zone Two-Person Concept Mandatory”) at the entrance to the maintenance bay, when applicable.  (T-1).  Signs are not required in storage facilities, PASs or for outside operations. 5.1.2.15.  When  WR  weapon(s)  are  exposed  in  the  maintenance  bay  or  PAS  and maintenance  personnel  are  present,  secure  the  personnel  entry  door  from  inside,  IAW DoD  S-5210.41-M.    (T-0).    Advance  Entry  Control  System  units  are  exempt  from  this requirement; however, the maintenance bay door must be closed.  If not possible, a two-person  team  will  control  entry.    SVA  will  approve  all  entry  into  exclusion  areas,  IAW DoD S-5210.41-M.  (T-0). 5.1.2.16.  There  are  no  JNWPS  periodic  inspection  requirements  for  nuclear  weapons.  However,  ensure  weapons  are  stored  in  a  safe  and  reliable  configuration  and  IAW applicable  directives  (i.e.,  properly  grounded,  chocked,  immobilized).    (T-1).    Ensure weapons have proper spacing, storage compatibility, and are within explosive and active material limits, IAW applicable directives.  (T-0). 5.1.2.16.1.  If  defects  are  discovered  on  weapons,  components  or  equipment  during walk-throughs,  ensure  defects  are  evaluated  using  applicable  JNWPS  technical publication,  technical  order  or  instruction  and  ensure  appropriate  corrective  actions are taken.  (T-0). 5.1.3.  Verification Inspections. 5.1.3.1.  Maintenance  personnel  perform  verification  inspections  on  weapons  and components  IAW  applicable  11N  series  TOs  as  soon  as  practical  after  receipt  to  verify the identity, quantity, and serial  numbers with  data shown on the shipping document or DIAMONDS  data.    Open  shipping  containers  for  this  verification;  however,  do  not disassemble  warhead  sections,  RVs,  or  bombs.    Where  weapon  disassembly  would  be required, verification requirements can be satisfied by comparing visible information on the weapon with corresponding data on the shipping document or DIAMONDS data, and weapon history records accompanying the shipment. 5.1.3.2.  During  H1616/1700  receipt,  units  are  not  required  to  open  containers  for component  serial  numbers  verification.    Verify  component  serial  numbers  during unpacking  before  use.    Both  NARS  and  maintenance  personnel  use  serial  numbers  and reservoir  fill  dates  on  the  shipping  documentation,  DIAMONDS  data,  and  exterior  tags on  containers  to  report  receipt.    If  a  discrepancy  is  found  between  the  shipping documentation, DIAMONDS data, and the container, contact the MAJCOM immediately and submit UR IAW T.O. 11N-5-1.  Obtain component part numbers from the item TO.  For DIAMONDS database purposes, if part number suffix is  unknown use part number plus  -XX  (Example:  123456-XX).    For  special  instructions  for  shipments  between Military First Destinations (MFD) and overseas locations, see TO 11N-100-3150. 5.1.3.3.  H1616  and  H1700  container  serial  numbers,  DOT  expiration  dates,  will  be updated in the NMC2 SharePoint Environment as changes occur.  NARS personnel will AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   35  use  expiration  dates  to  ensure  assets  are  not  shipped  in  overdue  containers  beyond  the military first destination. 5.1.3.4.  Do not open packaged MC4519 assemblies upon receipt.  Item is to be  opened only by the end user immediately prior to use, as directed by applicable TO procedures. 5.1.3.5.  NARS  personnel  will  perform  inspections  of  spare  parts.    If  spare  parts  are determined to be unserviceable, report IAW T.O. 11N-5-1. 5.1.4.  Defects and Deficiencies. 5.1.4.1.  Stop operations upon the discovery of a defect that causes rejection of a weapon or  major  component,  or  upon  encountering  any  unknown  or  unusual  weapon  or  major component condition.  The TC will inform the BC of the situation, who  will ensure the Nuclear Maintenance Element/Section NCOIC, Flight Chief, and the OO/MX SUPT are notified of the condition.  A supervisor appointed  IAW  paragraph  2.2.3.8 will make a management decision whether to continue operations based on careful review of the facts and circumstances.  This approval to continue does not relieve the unit of any reporting requirements  (UR/Dull  Sword).    Complete  the  operation  if  the  weapon  is  safe  and  no damage  will  occur.    If  the  decision  is  made  to  not  continue  the  operation,  contact  the applicable  MAJCOM  who  will  coordinate  with  NCP  to  resolve  the  situation.    Direct contact between MAJCOMs or units and other agencies (e.g.  DTRA or Sandia National Laboratories  (SNL))  for  any  weapons  related  technical  resolution  is  prohibited  unless directed by NCP. 5.1.4.1.1.  On site DoE representatives may determine continuation of operation (e.g., PAL  operation,  defect  acceptance)  when  authorized  procedures  are  not  available  in governing  TO.    However,  unit  personnel  must  report  the  defect(s)  according  to  TO 11N-5-1  and/or  AFMAN  91-221,  Weapons  Safety  Investigations  and  Reports,  as applicable.  (T-0). 5.1.4.1.2.  Individuals appointed IAW paragraph 2.2.3.8 are authorized to physically assess  (i.e.,  touch,  hold,  and  manipulate)  and  inspect  weapons,  components,  the weapon  system,  equipment,  tools,  etc.  when  assessing/validating  condition/status  or otherwise providing assistance. 5.1.4.2.  When  technical  procedures  call  for  components/parts  to  be  rejected  at  lowest level  available  in  spares,  weapons  will  be  placed  in  non-operational  status  if  the component/part cannot be replaced within NUREP timelines.  (T-1).  Weapons will also be  placed  in  non-operational  status  if  involved  in  an  accident  or  incident  and  the condition is unknown (e.g., lightning strike, fire, loss of custody, etc.).  (T-1). 5.1.4.3.  Personnel  must  return  non-operational  Tools,  Test,  and  Handling  Equipment (TTHE)  to  operational  status  as  soon  as  possible  not  to  exceed  30  duty  days  following UR, DR, Dull Sword, Engineering Technical Assistance Request (ETAR), and/or receipt of required replacement parts.  (T-1). 5.1.5.  Deficiency Reporting. 5.1.5.1.  Deficiencies  associated  with  nuclear  weapons,  nuclear  weapon-related  items, associated equipment/software or technical orders/publications must be reported.   36  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 5.1.5.2.  When assistance is required and the problem does not fit into one of the below categories  use  procedures  in  T.O.  00-25-107,  Maintenance  Assistance.    Use  requests from  T.O.  00-25-107  for  problems  with  maintenance  procedures  or  production  that  are beyond the capability of the maintaining command.  Maintenance assistance may take the form of emergency maintenance support, technical assistance, or a combination of both. 5.1.5.3.  Use procedures in T.O. 11N-5-1 to report a deficiency on DoE-designed nuclear weapons or related components,  DoE-designed equipment/software, a JNWPS technical order discrepancy/deficiency, or when DoE-designed items require evaluation based upon their  interface  with  DoD-designed  items.    Nuclear  weapons  placed  in  non-operational status  are  only  returned  to  operational  status  when  officially  directed  by  NCP  or  when directed via an assigned DTRA UR number. 5.1.5.4.  Use  procedures  in  AFMAN  91-221  to  report  a  safety  related  accident,  incident or deficiency (Broken Arrow, Bent Spear or Dull Sword) on items covered in the USAF Master  Nuclear  Certification  List  web  site  or  T.O.  21M-LGM30F-12-1,  Minuteman Nuclear  Surety  Procedures.    Examples  include  but  are  not  limited  to  general-purpose vehicles, ICBM related equipment, nuclear certified aircraft software, two-person concept violations, etc. 5.1.5.5.  Use  procedures Investigating System, to report deficiencies on DoD-designed items. in  T.O.  00-35D-54,  USAF  Deficiency  Reporting  and 5.1.5.6.  In  certain  instances,  it  may  be  necessary  to  submit  multiple  reports  on  one deficiency.  For example: 5.1.5.6.1.  Submit  reports  IAW  T.O.  11N-5-1  and  AFMAN  91-221,  Weapons  Safety Investigations and Reports, for: 5.1.5.6.2.  A weapon involved in an accident or incident (lightning, vehicle accident, loss of custody, etc). 5.1.5.6.3.  Stray voltage from a motor generator. 5.1.5.7.  Submit reports IAW AFMAN 91-221 and T.O. 00-35D-54 for: 5.1.5.7.1.  A nuclear certified vehicle still under warranty with burnt wire insulation. 5.1.5.7.2.  Chipped ablative material. 5.1.5.8.  Submit reports IAW T.O. 11N-5-1 and T.O. 00-35D-54 for: 5.1.5.8.1.  Rejected warhead and RS components due to deluge dump. 5.1.5.8.2.  Warhead/weapon damage due to hoist failure. 5.1.5.8.3.  Steering  fails  on  a  newly  manufactured/certified  forklift  causing  vehicle and weapon damage. 5.1.6.  Maintenance Tasks. 5.1.6.1.  Personnel  will  not  perform  WR  operations  until  they  complete  weapons academic  training,  applicable  safety  training,  and  nuclear  weapons  certification requirements IAW Chapter 4 of this instruction and DoD 3150.02-M.  (T-0). AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   37  5.1.6.2.  Nuclear weapons operations will be performed by 2M0XX/2WXXX personnel.  2M0X2s perform RS mate/demate and weapons handling tasks.  2M0X1s perform select mate/demate  tasks  and  weapons  handling  tasks.    2WXXX  perform  weapons  handling tasks.    2W2XX  perform  weapons  maintenance,  mate/demate,  and  RSTS/SFTS/RFSE checkout  tasks.    21MX,  2M0X1  and  2WXXX  personnel  may  perform  PAL/CMS operations.  OCONUS 1C3XX may perform certain PAL/CMS operations. 5.1.6.2.1.  In  circumstances  where  there  are  insufficient  2M0XX  or  2WXXX personnel available to perform the required nuclear weapons operations the applicable MAJCOM  will  designate  AFSCs  to  augment  assigned  2M0XX  or  2WXXX personnel,  however, there must be core 2W/2M  personnel  assigned and  available to manage  and  oversee  the  nuclear  operations.    In  addition  to  AFSC  requirements  all training,  security  clearance,  PRP  requirements,  and  certification  requirements  are applicable. 5.1.6.3.  A  certified  TC  will  direct  all  weapons  maintenance  and  weapons  mate/demate operations.    (T-1).    TCs  will  not  direct  multiple  operations  simultaneously.    (T-1).  MAJCOMs or units may require a TC to direct  weapons handling tasks performed with WR weapons. 5.1.6.4.  TCs  will give team  briefings, using verbal  demand-response techniques, before starting  operations  involving  a  WR  nuclear  weapon  or  warhead.    The  briefing  must include, as a minimum:  Description of the task, designation of personnel assigned to the task,  nuclear  surety  IAW  AFI  91-101,  necessary  safety,  emergency,  and  intrinsic radiation procedures, and the requirement of the Two-Person Concept. 5.1.6.5.  When a TC is communicating technical order procedures to technicians without physical access to TOs during nuclear weapons maintenance, mate/demate, and handling tasks, a verbal demand-response technique must be used.  (T-1).  The technique consists of  reading  the  step  to  be  performed,  along  with  all  notes,  cautions  and  warnings  to  the technicians  performing  the  work.    The  performing  technicians  will  acknowledge understanding,  perform  the  step,  and  then  verbally  verify  completion  to  the  person reading  the  steps.    The  person  reading  the  steps  will  then  check  off  the  steps.    If technicians are using technical data and checking off steps as they perform them (such as cleaning person on LLCE operations), a TC must ensure all steps are completed prior to weapon/component  reassembly.    Note:    The  above  referenced  operations  often  require the  use  of  general  procedures  contained  in  both  Operations  and  Maintenance  and Methods  and  Procedures  technical  orders  (e.g.,  11N-35-51,  1-1A-8,  00-25-234,  etc.).  These technical orders do not require verbal demand-response or checking off of steps. 5.1.6.6.  If  an  operation  is  halted  the  TC  will  mark  the  last  step  accomplished.    (T-1).  Resume  the  operation  only  after  reviewing  the  checklist  or  technical  order  in  order  to determine the operation restart point. 5.1.6.7.  ICBM Critical  Task Supervisors are required to  oversee all RS mate/demate or transfer  operations  involving  WR.    (T-2).    Critical  task  supervisors  are  not  required  to oversee transport operations. 5.1.7.  Weapon Movements.   38  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 5.1.7.1.  Nuclear  weapons,  TYPE  3  trainers,  JTA,  compatibility  test  units  (CTU),  and flight  test  units  (FTU)  will  be  covered  during  all  movements.  (T-1).    Exception: Containerized weapons,  RSs, and Cruise Missiles do not  require covers.   BDUs will be covered  when  they  are  simulating  WR  weapons.    (T-3).    JTA  movements  outside controlled  areas  must  have  appropriate  level  of  security  dependent  upon  security requirements for each JTA, CTU and FTU type.  (T-1). 5.1.7.2.  US custody of nuclear weapons must be maintained during all aspects of nuclear weapons storage, handling and logistics movements, IAW, DoD 3150.02-M.  (T-0). 5.1.7.3.  All on-base nuclear weapons movements outside the restricted area must have a member  serving  as  a  technical  and  safety  advisor.    (T-1).    The  convoy  technical  and safety advisor will be an NCO that is JQS qualified and fully knowledgeable of tiedown, transportation, handling, CDS, custody transfer, and emergency procedures as applicable.  For ICBM RS convoys, the certified payload transporter driver can serve as the technical and safety advisor. 5.1.7.4.  Ensure compliance with the movement procedures identified in DoD S-5210.41-M.  (T-0). 5.1.8.  Certifying  Nuclear  Weapons,  Nuclear  Warheads,  and  Components  Mated  to  RS  or Multiple Carriage Launch Gear. 5.1.8.1.  Certifying RS and multiple carriage launch gear configurations. 5.1.8.1.1.  When  building  RS,  pylon  and  launcher  prepare  a  nuclear  weapons configuration record (previously known as buildup sheet) to reflect the association of warhead and component serial numbers to RS, air launched missiles, and the missiles or  bombs  with  the  pylon  or  launcher.    The  maintenance  TC  responsible  for  final assembly  must  prepare  and  sign  the  nuclear  weapon  configuration  record  for  (as  a minimum) all NWRM and replaced parts/components, and a bay chief or above must visually verify the serial numbers and configuration  and certify doing so  by signing the  nuclear  weapon  configuration  record.    When  recording  NWRM  serial  numbers ensure  you  record  any  leading  alpha  character,  special  characters  and  zeroes,  etc.  This  certified  record  becomes  the  source  document  for  tracking  the  location  of weapons and components during storage, alert, and aircraft generation. 5.1.8.1.2.  Exceptions  to  visual  verification:  it  is  not  necessary  to  disassemble components  for  the  sole  purpose  of  obtaining  component  data  if  it  is  available  on previous configuration record. 5.1.8.2.  When building a RV prepare a configuration record to reflect the association of component  serial  numbers  to  RV.    The  TC  responsible  for  assembly  must  prepare  and sign  the  configuration  record  and  a  bay  chief  and  above  must  certify  the  configuration record by signing and visually verifying the serial numbers and configuration of the RV.  Both TC and BC must initial beside any changes to the record. 5.1.8.3.  Nuclear weapon configuration records for launchers and pylons  will be created and verified for both WR and non-WR packages.  (T-1).  Clearly mark nuclear weapon configuration records for non-WR packages as “NOT WR”. AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   39  5.1.8.3.1.  Use  the  nuclear  weapon  configuration  record  as  the  source  document  to establish the configuration of the RS, pylon, or launcher. 5.1.8.4.  Forward  the  original  certified  nuclear  weapon  configuration  record  to  the MASO.    Upload  RS/RV  nuclear  weapon  configuration  records  to  AFNWC/NIBF SharePoint. 5.1.8.5.  Units may elect to  report  in-hand/on-hand changes to  the MASO based on RS, launcher,  and  pylon  serial  numbers  only;  however,  if  they  do  so,  the  MASO  must maintain the certified nuclear weapon configuration record showing the configuration of the RS or launch gear at the time of the report for as long as they retain the MAR. 5.1.8.6.  Swap of a single missile on a pylon or launcher, or a single bomb on a launcher or loaded combat aircraft. 5.1.8.6.1.  Prepare an updated certified nuclear weapon configuration record. 5.1.8.6.2.  Forward the original of the updated nuclear weapon configuration record to the MASO. 5.1.8.7.  During build-up/recycle maintenance, for systems returning to operational status, if the previous configuration record is missing information, disassemble the component to the point where the information can be obtained.  Reject the component if unserviceable.  Exception:  Electric explosive device, if information is illegible, not available or requires removal notify conventional munitions inspector for serviceability validation. 5.1.9.  Trainer Use and Maintenance. 5.1.9.1.  Units  will  use  TYPE  3  A/C  trainers  for  maintenance  and  Explosive  Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training only.  (T-1).  Do not use these trainers for aircraft or ICBM load training, logistical  movement  exercises and evaluations, or other purposes without NCP approval.  Use TYPE 3E trainers, RS/RV trainers (UE), TFPs, or BDUs for this purpose.  Trainers  must  be  controlled,  stored,  and  secured  according  to  their  respective  security classification.  (T-1). 5.1.9.1.1.  Maintain  nuclear  weapon  TYPE  3  A/C  trainers  to  WR  standards  IAW applicable  weapons  manual  and  T.O.  11N-35-51.    Type  3  A/C  trainers  used exclusively  for  EOD  training  will  be  maintained  in  a  WR  configuration  and  may deviate  from  WR  standards  with  UR  approval.    RS  (UE)  load  shape  trainers  are maintained IAW applicable 43D-series technical orders. 5.1.9.1.2.  Inspect  nuclear  weapons  trainers,  TYPE  3E,  load  shape/trainers  as specified  in  the  applicable  technical  order,  not  to  exceed  180-days.    (T-2).    When specific  weapon  trainer/component  criteria  is  not  available,  use  equivalent  WR criteria for inspection.  However, rejection criteria established for WR does not render weapon trainer/components unserviceable.  The owning activity may continue to use the weapon trainer if fit, form, or function is not affected and personnel safety, further equipment  damage  or  structural  integrity  is  not  questioned.    Submission  of  an Unsatisfactory Report for evaluation of deficiencies is still required IAW T.O. 11N-5-1. 5.1.9.1.3.  For  those  trainers  not  on  the  weapons  maintenance  custody  account  or installed  in  ALCM  Interface  Test  Trainers  (ITT),  the  OO/MX  SUPT  and  owning   40  AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015 agency  will  work  out  a  periodic  inspection  and  maintenance  schedule  to  repair deficiencies in order to keep the trainers in WR configuration.   (T-1).  Use IMDS to track inspection and maintenance of trainers. 5.1.9.2.  Units may elect to track deficiencies/historical documentation for TYPE 3E load shape/trainers  using  AFTO  Form  244,  Industrial/Support  Equipment  Record,  AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data, or IMDS, as appropriate.  An IRC is not required on TYPE 3E or BDU load shape/trainers. 5.1.9.3.  Prohibit installation  of WR items,  components,  or materiel  on TYPE 3 trainers unless  authorized  by  technical  data  or  NCP.    (EXCEPTION:    Reuse  of  expended  or expired Group X items for training is acceptable).  Units will never install training items, components, or hardware on WR items, unless directed by JNWPS technical procedures.  (T-0). 5.2.  Waste Management. 5.2.1.  Three  basic  types  of  federally  regulated  materials  can  be  generated  during  nuclear weapons  maintenance  activities.    These  generated  materials  may  become  wastes  regulated either  as  Resource  Conservation  &  Recovery  Act  (RCRA)  hazardous  waste,  91b  Waste  or Potentially  Mixed  Waste.    Maintenance  personnel  will  assure  that  all  wastes  are  properly identified, segregated and containerized as the waste is  generated and according to the type of waste being generated.  (T-0). 5.2.2.  RCRA  regulated  hazardous  waste  includes  spent  and/or  expired  hazardous  materials that  are  available  for  use  or  used  in  the  routine  conduct  of  the  maintenance  activities  and includes solvent soaked rags or wipes.  RCRA Hazardous Waste, however, does not include materials  that  become  contaminated  by  a  radioactive  source  or  demonstrate  a  radioactive property.    RCRA  wastes  include  items  such  as  un-useable  or  spent  solvents,  lubricants  and paints. 5.2.3.  91b  Waste  is  generated  when  a  system  component  is  inherently  and/or  becomes contaminated  solely  by  a  radioactive  source  within  the  contiguous  volume  where  a  tritium reservoir  resides  without  the  introduction  of  a  hazardous  material.    These  wastes  include items  such  as  compression  pads,  un-greased  O-rings,  Kim  wipes  or  Q-tips  used  to  wipe internal components without the use of solvents, and expired weapon desiccant. 5.2.3.1.  91b Waste areas for MK12A are: Inside of the associated aft section and inside surfaces of the H1223A/B aft bulkhead cover/ring. 5.2.3.2.  91b  Waste  areas  for  the  MK21  are:  the  enclosure  formed  by  the  inside  of  the Warhead Electrical System (WES) cap and aft end of the AFA and inside the WES cap. 5.2.4.  Potentially  Mixed  Waste  is  generated  when  a  91b  Waste  is  combined  with  a  RCRA Hazardous Waste.  An example is a Kim wipe, wiper or rag that becomes contaminated with spent  hazardous  material  solvent  once  used  to  wipe  internal  components  and  surfaces  of  a radioactive source. 5.2.5.  Collection  and  Identification.    Local  bioenvironmental  section  may  survey  and perform analysis on hazardous waste containers to determine what type of waste is generated.  These  surveys  can  be  used  to  reduce  the  number  of  containers  distributed  to  maintenance activities. AFI21-204  17 DECEMBER 2015   41  5.2.6.  RCRA  Hazardous  Waste  Management  guidance  is  available  through  the  Installation Environmental  Flight.    Base-wide  instructions  are  also  found  in  the  installation  Hazardous Waste  Management  Plan  (HWMP),  which  outlines  specific  procedures  for  managing hazardous  waste.    Coordinate  through  the  local  environmental  management  flight  for container turn-in or pick-up and disposal IAW AFI 32-7042, Waste Management. 5.2.7.  Units  will  package  91b  Waste  in  the  bags  consistent  with  the  operation  being performed  and  store  in  drums,  label  packages  and  drums  “Potentially  91b  Waste"  and coordinate through local bioenvironmental  channels for container pickup and disposal  IAW AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force.  (T-1).  OCONUS units coordinate pick-up and disposal through MAJCOM. 5.2.8.  Units  will  package  Mixed  Waste  in  the  bags  consistent  with  the  operation  being performed,  store  in  drums,  label  packages  and  drums  "Mixed  Waste  Potentially  91b"  and coordinate through local bioenvironmental  channels for container pickup and disposal  IAW AFI 40-201.  (T-1).  OCONUS units coordinate pick-up and disposal through MAJCOM. 5.2.9.  Units  will  not  store  or  co-mingle  Hazardous  Waste,  potentially  91b  Waste  or  Mixed Waste in the same package or drum.  (T-1). 5.2.10.  Low  Level  Radioactive  Waste  (LLRW)  programs  are  driven  by  environmental regulatory compliance and are not  a personnel  safety issue.  Radiation  levels  are  extremely low.  Waste generated during cleaning of tools used during maintenance is NOT a 91b Waste issue.    It  is  not  necessary  to  wear  personnel  protective  or  safety  equipment  while  working around the gas transfer systems of a weapon within the parameters outlined in the applicable technical orders, unless otherwise directed (e.g. cleaning with solvents).
