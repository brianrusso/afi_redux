Introduction  AFH63-1402   19 MARCH 20011.1. The Aircraft Information Program (AIP) supports mishap investigations, Flight OperationalQuality Assurance (FOQA), Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Aircraft and Engine StructuralIntegrity Programs (ASIP/ENSIP), aircraft development programs and training.  Its primary goal is tobalance information needs with program resources and operational considerations.  This handbookprovides guidance in selecting the appropriate recording parameters and functional requirements forinformation collection systems. 1.2. Mishap investigations are relatively straightforward processes where causes and contributingfactors are determined and used to produce a list of recommendations that should prevent future mis-haps.  However, many investigations are inconclusive due to lack of evidence to support mishap sce-narios.  This allows insidious conditions to persist and cause future mishaps. 2. Program Goals  2.1. Institutionalize Mishap Investigative Information Requirements 2.1.1. Voice and data recorders for mishap information collection have traditionally lacked advo-cates in the operational and acquisition communities. 2.1.2. Standing policy requiring Flight Data Recorders (FDRs) was issued in 1973.  LessonsLearned since that time have illustrated the need to institutionalize a process requiring the explicitaddressing of investigative information data gathering needs. 2.1.3. Numerous customers exist for recorded aircraft information.  Training and mishap investi-gation are two obvious reasons to record the performance of the aircraft and crew.  Industry haspioneered the use of such information in a proactive mode.  A FOQA program examines non-mis-hap flight data in a non-attribution basis to identify hazardous flight procedures and environments. 2.1.4. The engine and structural communities have been performing RCM for many years.  Theutility of predicting component wearout or imminent failure has resulted in extensive cost savings.The ability to remove or repair on an as needed basis versus scheduled intervals has saved costsand circumvented component failures leading to mishaps. 2.2. Improve Quality of Mishap Investigation and Reporting 2.2.1. The Air Force forms boards to investigate and determine the cause(s) of mishaps.  Whilemany mishaps are straightforward and benefit from surviving crew testimony, the majorityrequires extensive analysis, test and simulation.  With modern aircraft employing electronic con-trol systems and video displays, some physical evidence no longer exists at the mishap scene. 2.2.2. Those aircraft with crash survivable data recorders have demonstrated more conclusiveinvestigations than those without recorders.  This allows the board to spend less time determiningwhat occurred and more time determining why a mishap occurred. 2.3. Enable FOQA and RCM Programs 2.3.1. Commercial aviation has pioneered the use of “non-mishap” data to detect hazardous oper-ational trends.  Examples of such trends would include excessive bank angles, hard landings, andunstabilized approaches.  In general, looking for any trigger that would focus attention on a haz-ardous situation. AFH63-1402   19 MARCH 200132.3.2. The implementation of a FOQA program presents a number of challenges.  One hotlydebated topic is the potential use of FOQA data for punitive action.  The identity of the crew mustbe stripped from the data within a short time span and at the lowest organizational level feasible.Consequently, pre-processing of the data must be accomplished in a timely manner to allow inter-viewing the crew for clarification of unique data trends. Flight crew acceptance of FOQA as anon-punitive program is a fundamental building block that cannot be compromised.  2.3.3. Another FOQA challenge is the sheer volume of collected information.  Ground supportsoftware requires specific “triggers” to analyze the recorded data and detect hazardous conditions.These suspect records then require closer human evaluation to validate the concern of the expertsystem. 2.3.4. Commercial aviation includes equipment monitoring and trending in its definition ofFOQA while the Air Force refers to it as Reliability Centered-Maintenance (RCM).  In any event,it has been shown in both government and industry that impressive cost savings can be accom-plished.  Whether it’s extending the removal interval of engines, or detecting excessive fuel con-sumption due to flight control misrigging, both safety and cost avoidance are accomplished. 2.4. Assure Integrated Solution 2.4.1. There are many sources of information on an aircraft.  Modern aircraft systems have digitaldatabuses with volumes of parametric data readily available for recorders.  Cockpit Voice Record-ers are on many aircraft capturing valuable acoustic information.  Training needs often result inHeads-Up-Display (HUD) and Multi-Function Display (MFD) video recorders. 2.4.2. Future weapon systems may have separate acoustic, video and parametric informationsources or achieve optimizations through integration of the technologies.  Analyzing the total sys-tem requirements will provide the best and lowest cost solution to the program.  2.5. Enhance Training Effectiveness 2.5.1. Videotapes of Heads-Up-Display (HUD) and Multi-Function Display (MFD) images arecurrently used in crew training.  The tapes occasionally survive crash dynamics and contribute toboard investigations.  Emerging recording system technologies are capable of integrating acoustic,image and parametric information into crash survivable packages. 2.5.2. Integration of these information sources coupled with real time simulators will providehigher fidelity training opportunities. 2.6. Assist new aircraft development programs. 2.6.1. Identification of information customers should occur prior to the Engineering, Manufactur-ing  and Development phase of a program. Early identification will result in the most cost effectiveand integrated solution for the program. Establish the AIWG early to assist in specification ofrequirements. 3. Standardization  3.1. Mishap investigators ascertain the cause of an accident by determining the state of the aircraft,the environment in which it was operating, and the actions of the crew that led up to the event. 3.2. Early recorders were designed to capture the fundamental parameters of altitude, heading, air-speed and vertical acceleration.  These parameters enabled the investigator to recreate the flight path4AFH63-1402   19 MARCH 2001of the air vehicle and then postulate what subsystem failures or crew actions would result in such aflight profile.  These postulations along with other evidence were used by the investigator to conductanalyses and arrive at a cause of the mishap. 3.3. These fundamental parameters were selected in an environment where parameter recording wasnot as simple an endeavor as it is today.  Designing a recording system that would both record param-eters to sufficient resolution and survive an impact was no small feat in the 1950’s.  However, as moreresources were put to the task and technology advanced it became feasible to increase both the dura-tion and number of parameters recorded. 3.4. The next generation of parameters added pitch attitude, roll attitude, longitudinal acceleration,pitch trim and engine thrust.  These new parameters added to the accuracy of determining aircraftdynamics and most probable crew actions.  The requirement to record either control column displace-ment or pitch control surface position was also added at this time to help distinguish when aircraftdynamics were directly attributable to crew action or subsystem failure. 3.5. The next expansion of recorded parameters included most crew control inputs and control sur-face positions thereby clearly distinguishing between crew commanded maneuvers and aircraft fail-ures. 3.6. With the proliferation of digital data buses and computer technology it is now possible to recordhundreds of parameters for many hours.  Modern military aircraft demonstrate this ability by record-ing a plethora of information.  Consequently, one of the challenges now becomes assuring criticalparameters are captured in crash survivable media and not overlooked while identifying parametersused for other purposes. 3.7. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the European Organization for Civil AviationEquipment (EUROCAE) and the U.S. military services have periodically recommended specificparameters for mishap investigation.  Many of these parameters have subsequently been required to berecorded as a minimum allowable set by various worldwide regulatory agencies such as the FAA andJoint Aviation Authority (JAA). 3.8. Tables 1 and 2 reflect an extensive list of parameters available for recording on both aircraft andhelicopters, respectively.  These parameters are essential to either investigative or preventative main-tenance efforts.  While the list is extensive, there will always be “just one more” parameter that couldbe captured.  Additionally, military aircraft may have mission specific or special equipment status thatcould also be recorded.  So while the list appears complete, mission needs and requirements may dic-tate a more extensive list when deciding on data recording requirements. 3.9. Parameters listed in Tables 1 and 2 are categorized further based on their importance to the inves-tigative and mishap prevention process.  Category 1 and 2 data satisfy the Chief of Staff directive thatrequires a standard set of Digital Flight Data Recorder parameters for inclusion in existing andplanned future weapon systems. 3.10. Performance and functional requirements for information recording systems should be deter-mined by exhaustive review of current industry standards and mishap lessons learned.  FAA TechnicalStandard Orders (TSOs) such as C-124a and C-123a should be consulted.  International standardiza-tion efforts by EUROCAE and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) should be reviewedalong with recommendations of the NTSB and USAF Safety Center. The USAF Safety Center will beable to provide the latest standards and USAF positions relative to these standards. AFH63-1402   19 MARCH 200153.11. Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 25.1457, Cockpit Voice Recorders and FAR 25.1459, FlightData Recorders should be reviewed by the AIWG for the applicability to each program. 4. AIWG Formation.  Each aircraft program will establish an Aircraft Information Working Group(AIWG).  The purpose of the AIWG is to ensure that decisions affecting aircraft system capabilitiesaccount for information needs of the operational, maintenance and safety communities. 4.1. The program manager/director or his designated representative will chair the AIWG and overseethe writing of its charter and the Aircraft Information Management Plan (AIMP).  The AIWG chairwill solicit appropriate members and advisors in accordance with the guidance of AFI 63-1401.  TheAIWG shall assure the members and advisors are empowered to represent their organization and suf-ficiently trained and experienced in the subject matter to contribute positively. 4.2. Membership of the AIWG shall consist of the following individuals whose roles and responsibil-ities are defined in AFI 63-1401. The chairman  The Chief Engineer or representative Representatives from the lead command to address operational, logistical and maintenance issues. Representative from the Air Force Safety Center 4.3. The AIWG will determine the appropriate inspection period for validating the quality and func-tionality of all AIP components. 5. Aircraft Information Management Plan 5.1. The AIMP will address all information needs of the subject aircraft.  All forms of informationregardless of recording media or transmission method will be considered.   5.2. Acoustic, imagery, datalink, and parametric information shall be considered when arriving at anintegrated solution for the program. 5.3. The AIWG will advise when the AIMP is required and draft the document for Program Manage-ment approval. 6. Parameter Selection Process.   6.1. To record all possible information on every aircraft would be both cost prohibitive and unrealis-tic.  However, a balance must be struck between optimization for the information customer and costavoidance.   6.2. Even though the USAF participates in many commercial standardization efforts we seldom havesufficient influence to require parameters that could be viewed as military unique. Parameter tables1.0 and 2.0 were specifically crafted for military aircraft from participation in international workinggroups, recommendations of the NTSB and military lessons learned.  The parameter category reflectsit’s hierarchical importance and is described below. References to FAR and WG-50 numbers aresolely provided as a tool to correlate AIP parameters to those recommended by national and interna-tional bodies. 1 – Required 6AFH63-1402   19 MARCH 20012 – Required if electronic displays/glass cockpit otherwise, recommended 3 – Highly desirable if data stream accessible 4 – Recommended if readily available 6.3. Ability for the user to delete geographical, flight path, and performance information should beconsidered in the system design to address both wartime and peacetime security concerns. However,this ability must be validated by the customer of the information being deleted and provided only asunique operational requirements dictate. Sufficient safeguards against arbitrary and capricious dele-tion of information must be included in the system design. Table 1. Fixed Wing Aircraft Parameters.
