The Joint Staff (JS)   1.1.1. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).  A group of military leaders in the United States armed forces who advise the civilian government of the United States. The JCS is defined by statute and consists of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, and the four military Service Chiefs. The JCS does not have operational command of U.S. military forces. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the President to the Secretary of Defense (SecDef) directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands and thus bypasses the JCS completely.  The primary responsibility of the JCS is to ensure the personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective military services for the combatant commanders to utilize. The JCS also act in a military advisory capacity for the President of the United States and the SecDef. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the second-highest deliberative body for military policy, after the National Security Council (NSC). Acting in their capacity as military advisers, the other members of the JCS may submit to the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) advice or opinions in disagreements with, or in addition to, the Chairman’s advice for presentation at the same time the Chairman presents his views to the President, NSC, Homeland Security Council (HSC) or SecDef.     1.1.2. Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff.  The CJCS is the senior ranking military officer, and the principal military advisor to the President, the NSC, HSC and the SecDef.  In carrying out his function, the CJCS will consult with and seek advice from the other members of the JCS.   1.1.3. Joint Staff.  The JS assists the CJCS in accomplishing his responsibilities for:  the unified strategic direction of the combatant forces; their operation under unified command; and for their integration into an efficient team of land, naval, and air forces. The JS is composed of approximately equal numbers of officers from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. In practice, the Marines make up about 20 percent of the number allocated to the Navy. 1.1.3.1.  The CJCS, after consultation with other JCS members and with the approval of the SecDef, selects the Director, Joint Staff (DJS) to assist in managing the JS.  By law, the direction of the JS rests exclusively with the CJCS. As the Chairman directs, the JS also may assist the other JCS members in carrying out their responsibilities. 1.1.3.2.  In the joint arena, a body of senior flag or general officers assists in resolving matters not requiring JCS attention. Each Service Chief appoints      3                  an operations deputy who works with the DJS, to form the subsidiary body known as the Operations Deputies or the OPSDEPS. They meet in sessions chaired by the DJS, to consider issues of lesser importance or to review major issues before they reach the JCS. With the exception of the Director, this body is not part of the JS. There is also a subsidiary body known as the Deputy Operations Deputies (DEPOPSDEPs), composed of the Vice Director, Joint Staff (VDJS) and a two-star flag or general officer appointed by each Service Chief. Currently, the DEPOPSDEPs are the Service directors for plans. Issues come before the DEPOPSDEPs to be settled at their level or forwarded to the OPSDEPS. Except for the VDJS, the DEPOPSDEPs are not part of the JS. 1.1.3.3. Matters come before these bodies under policies prescribed by the JCS. The DJS, is authorized to review and approve issues when there is no dispute among the Services, when the issue does not warrant JCS attention, when the proposed action is in conformance with CJCS policy, or when the issue has not been raised by a member of the JCS. Actions completed by either the OPSDEPs or DEPOPSDEPs will have the same effect as actions by the JCS.  1.1.3.4. Under the authority, direction, and control of the CJCS is a JS that assists the Chairman and other members of the JCS in carrying out their responsibilities.  The JS is headed by a Director, selected by the CJCS, after consultation with the JCS, and approved by the SecDef.  The JS is forbidden by law from operating as a general staff of the Armed Forces and has no executive authority.  The JS is comprised of the offices of the Chairman, the Director, the Directorate of Management, and the directorates listed in figure 1.1. where all the planning, policies, intelligence, manpower, communications and logistics functions are translated into action.             Figure 1.1. Directorates within the JS (1) J-1 (Manpower and Personnel) (2) J-2 (Intelligence) (3) J-3 (Operations) (4) J-4 (Logistics) (5) J-5 (Strategic Plans and Policy) (6) J-6 (Command, Control, Communications, and Computer Systems) (7) J-7 (Operational Plans and Joint Force Development) (8) J-8 (Force Structure, Resources, and Assessment) (9) J-9 (Joint Concept Development and Experimentation) (10) DOM (Directorate of Management)       4  1.2.  HAF Representation & Responsibilities on Joint Actions   1.2.1.  JCS representatives.  The Air Force (AF) representatives are the Chief of Staff, the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS) for Operations, Plans and Requirements (AF/A3/5), the Assistant DCS for Operations, Plans and Requirements (Deputy AF/A3/5), and the AF planners for Joint & NSC Matters. Only the Chief of Staff of the AF (CSAF), OPSDEP, DEPOPSDEP, and AF planners may provide the AF position on a JCS action.  1.2.2.  CSAF.  The CSAF fulfills statutory obligations as the primary AF representative to the JCS.  The CSAF shall inform the Secretary of the Air Force (SecAF) regarding military advice rendered by members of the JCS on matters affecting the Department of the Air Force.  Due to the unique, dual responsibilities of the CSAF, joint actions must be conducted expeditiously, with appropriate horizontal coordination to provide the best possible military advice.  1.2.3.  OPSDEP.  The AF/A3/5 is designated as the AF OPSDEP.  As the principal advisor to the CSAF on JCS and NSC matters, the OPSDEP has the complete and unqualified approval of the CSAF to act on JCS matters.  All Headquarters AF (HAF) elements advise the CSAF, through the OPSDEP, on all joint matters.  1.2.4.  DEPOPSDEP.  The Deputy AF/A3/5 is designated as the AF DEPOPSDEP, with authority to address matters within the cognizance of the JCS or as directed by the CSAF or OPSDEPs.  The DEPOPSDEP works on as many matters as possible.  At his level, the DEPOPSDEP works on multiple operational issues, thus, allowing time for the CSAF and OPSDEP to devote their energies to other JCS leadership matters  1.2.5.  AF Planner.  By direction of CJCSI 5711.01C, Policy on Action Processing, the planners support their respective Services, DEPOPSDEP, OPSDEP and Chief in the discharge of their statutory and assigned functions.  According to JS Instruction 5711.01D, Action Processing (Enclosure C.3.), the AF planners represent the CSAF, OPSDEP, and DEPOPSDEP and are accredited to provide final coordination to the JS on joint matters.  As the first line of authority on the Service staff, they assist in the formulation, coordination and communication of the Service position for JS actions.    1.2.6.  AF Joint Action Control Office (JACO).  According to JS Instruction 5711.01D, Action Processing (Enclosure C.3.), each Service has a JACO to act as the administrative manager for all Joint & NSC correspondence between the JS and Service Headquarters.  JACOs are the single point of contact responsible for receiving all joint actions, determining the Service action required, assigning the action to the appropriate Service office and ensuring the task is completed by the required JS suspense date.  The JACOs work closely with the AF planners to obtain final Service coordination on joint actions, except those issues under the purview of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council.  The Planners and the JACO have the authority to task across the Air Force to assign subject matter experts (SME) to provide the timeliest, accurate, and fully coordinated response possible.  The JACO governs the AF joint actions process; trains, manages and provides 5   guidance to the appointed Joint-Readers (J-Rdrs) for all JCS processing actions.  The JACO is the official AF repository and library for all such documents.  1.2.7.  Service JACO.   Contact information is represented in figure 1.2.  Figure 1.2. Service JACOs Army:  703-614-6872; email army.jaco@hqda-s.army.pentagon.smil.mil  Air Force:  703-697-0645; SIPR email af.jaco@af.pentagon.smil.mil; NIPR email af.jaco@pentagon.af.mil   Marine Corps: 703-693-2071; email hqmcusmcjaco@hqmc.usmc.smil.mil  Navy: 703-692-9121; email jaco.cno@navy.smil.mil   USCG:  202-372-2121; email ncc@uscg.smil.mil   1.2.8.   Joint Reader (J-Rdr).  Each HAF two-letter/digit organization should appoint (see JACO portal via the AF Portal page: (https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/globalTab.do?channelPageId=s6925EC1351C00FB5E044080020E329A9) a primary and at least one alternate J-Rdr (but no more than 10% of assigned personnel).  Selection of J-Rdrs should be limited to seasoned action officers (AOs).  A seasoned AO has at least 6-12 months HAF experience.  In order to prepare the most complete and fully coordinated AF position, the HAF organization assigned as the OPR for a joint action is authorized to directly task other HAF organizations, Major Commands (MAJCOMs), direct reporting units (DRUs) and field operating agencies (FOAs) for input.  J-Rdrs involved with the JS action are also authorized direct liaison authority with AF commands, agencies and organizations with interest.  AF JACO manages the J-Rdr program and provides training/advice to J-Rdrs in the execution of their duties.   1.2.9. J-Rdrs / Workflow Manager Responsibilities. J-Rdrs / Workflow Managers are tasked with understanding the joint process and assisting AOs in completing joint actions.  J-Rdrs / Workflow Managers will review the Status of Ongoing Joint Actions, sent daily from AF JACO, and distribute through their organization, as appropriate.  J-Rdrs will ensure AOs understand the joint action process and have the materials/training necessary to work these tasks.  J-Rdrs will verify AOs have appropriately and thoroughly coordinated all JCS actions, briefing materials, and correspondence with all interested AF organizations (HAF, MAJCOMs, DRUs and FOAs, as appropriate).  J-Rdrs will also ensure responses represent the position of their HAF two-letter/digit organization, are completed within the allotted suspense (or extensions approved as needed), are in the correct format, grammatically correct, appropriately classified, and completely answer the issue under consideration.  J-Rdrs also play a key role in the Tank process.  They will review the Status Report, sent daily from AF JACO, to monitor, track and assist AOs assigned within their respective HAF two-letter/digit organization, in completing the required products (Brief sheet, briefing slide Facers, and Debrief sheet.  It is essential for Tank products to include the “View of Others”.  6   1.2.10.  Action Officers.  AOs are the SMEs who develop the position on a joint action by consolidating and coordinating input from all applicable organizations.  AOs are authorized to coordinate across the entire AF. Chapter 2 -- Joint Action Processing 2.1.  Origination of Joint Actions    2.1.1.  JS actions must be developed in a uniform and timely manner and reflect the best possible military judgment.  According to JS Instruction 5711.01D, Action Processing, the JS prepares actions for information, recommendation, decision, or action supporting the CJCS in the following areas:  2.1.1.1.  Presenting military advice to the President, NSC, and SecDef.  2.1.1.2.  Coordinating with the NSC and the other interagency groups in matters of defense.  2.1.1.3.  Providing guidance and instructions to the combatant commands.  2.1.1.4.  Establishing policies and procedures to discharge other statutory and directed responsibilities vested by the CJCS.  2.1.1.5.  Performing the day-to-day operations of the JS. 2.2.  Coordination with the Services   2.2.1.  Coordination gives organizations an opportunity to contribute to and comment on joint actions.  Early involvement of all concerned organizations is crucial to the full development of an issue.  Additionally, although the CJCS is the principal military advisor, the Service Chiefs and Vice CJCS (VCJCS), as members of the JCS, are also military advisors to the President and the SecDef.  In this capacity, they have the responsibility to submit their views, if they differ from or add to, those of the Chairman.  Coordination with the Services provides other JCS members an opportunity to fulfill their statutory responsibilities, and ensures the CJCS is aware of those views.    2.2.2.  Some items are tasked by OSD to the Service Secretaries and the JS simultaneously.  These items are considered “dual tasked,” as they are routed to the Service via both Secretariat and joint channels.  Per CJCS Instruction (CJCSI) 5711.01C, Policy on Action Processing, it is assumed the Service will respond through Secretariat channels only.  It is the AF policy to respond to all dual-tasked actions via the Secretariat channels.  In these cases, the JACO, after verifying the item is being tracked by HAF Executive Secretariat (HAF/ES) (noting the Task Management Tool (TMT) or SIPR task number), will notify the JS AO that the AF will treat the action as “dual-tasked” and the answer will be submitted through Secretariat channels.    7  2.3.  Joint Actions Characteristics/Transmittal of Joint Actions  2.3.1.  JS requests for coordination from the Services are normally sent via a JS Form 136, Joint Staff Action Processing Form (occasionally a transmittal memorandum).  The JS 136 is similar to a Staff Summary Sheet, and is used to document coordination within the JS and Services.  The transmittal Memo email will identify the type and level of coordination required.  The Services may also receive formal tasking through memoranda from JS Directors, messages dispatched by CJCS, DJS, or JS Directors.  See Figure 2.1 for a flowchart depiction of the Joint Action Process.      JS AO Joint Staff Division Chief Initiates / release  Joint Staff Action Package (JSAP) Reviews coord & votes AF Position to JS AO cc AF/JACO on response Service JACO / Planner Assigns OPR/OCR QC / review, approves & submit to JACO 2 or 3-Ltr Exec  & J-READER Assigns OPR/OCR Reviews, approves, forward to Exec or J-Reader AO to AO Prelim Coord Line Division Capture  “Views of Others” Sister Services AO OCRs Figure 2-1:  Joint Actions Process Develops / staffs JABS, AFPMs, etc  2.3.2.  There are three types of JS 136 actions, identified by markings on the Joint Staff Transmittal Memorandum (JS 136 TM) (see JACO portal for examples).  The type of action is indicated using check boxes on the JS 136 TM or simply using the transmittal email from JS.  The TM specifies the suspense date and provides direction on the type of response requested.  The JACO will direct the required level of coordination when assigning the task to an OPR.  2.3.2.1.  Information.  Sometimes a JS 136 is sent as “copy provided.”  Information actions are provided to keep all the Services aware of joint activities.  OPRs need to review the information, forward to all AF organizations with interest, determine if any AF equities are affected, and if so, provide appropriate response to JS.  8       AF JACO reviews the required action and routes to OPR with the greatest Designated J-Rdr (or workflow manager) reviews and designates an office JS AO will generate a JS 136 (or TM) marked with AO-level and 2.3.2.2.  Preliminary Coordination/Action Officers (AO) level.  In the early stages of joint policy development, the JS will request input from the Services to shape that policy and begin getting Service buy-in by sending the action out for Service AO coordination.  Preliminary coordination does not constitute an official AF position, but should be consistent with existing AF policy and guidance.  The JACO will task and distribute the action to the workflow manager / J-Rdr.  Coordination at the AO level, with all interested HAF, MAJCOMS, FOAs, and DRUs, is essential during this phase.  This provides an opportunity to include AF views early in the issue development. The office designated as the OPR will ensure complete AF coordination is accomplished.  The AOs will respond directly to the JS AO with the requested information and Courtesy copy (Cc) the AF JACO.  Preliminary coordination is generally followed by final coordination. The steps to process a preliminary coordination are listed in figure 2.1.        Figure 2.1. Process Steps for Preliminary Coordination  1) preliminary coordination and submit to Service JACOs 2) interest via the J-Rdr and workflow 3) within their HAF two-letter/digit organization to complete the task 4) 5) and provides approved comments to the JS AO no later than (NLT) the JS suspense; Cc AF JACO for closure of the task  2.3.2.3.  Final Coordination.  Final Coordination requires an official AF position approved by the Service planners at a minimum.  Non-concur positions must be reviewed/endorsed by a General Officer / Senior Executive Service (GO/SES).  The J-Rdr assigned as the OPR shall submit the fully coordinated /completed packages to the AF JACO NLT the JACO suspense date.  JACO and AF planners will review the completed action and formally “vote” the AF position to the JS.  Final coordination can only be relayed to the JS by an AF planner, the DEPOPSDEP, the OPSDEP, or the CSAF.  To process final coordination, take the steps listed in figure 2.2.  Figure 2.2. Process Steps for Final Coordination 1)  JS AO will generate a JS 136 (or TM) marked with planner-level and final Assigned Directorate designates the appropriate SME to complete the task Assigned SME reviews the action, gains appropriate level of coordination coordination and submit to Service JACOs 2)  AF JACO reviews the required action and routes to OPR with the greatest role via the J-Rdr and workflow; Office(s) of Collateral Responsibility (OCRs) will be  designated but may not be all inclusive; OPRs do not need JACO approval to add additional OCRs, if required 3)  Designated J-Rdr (or workflow manager) reviews and designates an office within their HAF two-letter/digit organization to complete the task 4)  Assigned Directorate designates the appropriate SME to complete the task 9   5)  Assigned SME reviews the action, gains proper and complete coordination from all organizations with interests across the AF and formulates the AF position prior to submitting to the J-Rdr 6)  J-Rdr reviews the entire package and ensures proper level coordination (Division chief coordination at a minimum) and submits to AF JACO NLT JACO suspense. For packages requiring AF/A3/5 or CSAF coordination, assigned OPR will gain 3-ltr endorsement (except AF/A3/5 OPR) prior to submitting to JACO; AF planner will then submit package to AF/A3/5 or CSAF (when required) 7)  JACO reviews the entire package to ensure proper level coordination (Division chief coordination as a minimum) and submits to AF planner for release 8)  AF planner reviews content, signs on behalf of the AF and returns to JACO for release to the JS 9)  AF JACO sends the official AF position to the JS AO (votes the package) - JS will attempt to resolve any disagreements with AF assigned AO;  AF planners will intervene when appropriate -  Secretary JS issues implementing memorandum -  AF/A3/5 initiates implementation of decision; HAF, MAJCOMs, DRUs & FOAs implement, as required  2.3.2.4.  General Officer / Senior Executive Service Final Coordination or Endorsement. Another level of final coordination is GO/SES Final level coordination. The JS 136 will requests GO coordination in the text or it may be directed by AF JACO/Planner. Usually, the JS is looking for GO/SES concurrence on an issue or document prior to submitting to the Chairman or Secretary and wishes to show complete Service buy-in. NOTE: GO/SES coordination will be annotated on the AFPM or on the JACO transmittal email (in the case of a concur without comment). If GO/SES coordination is required, only the GO/SES with the most interest in the subject is required, normally the OPR.  However, if the OCR is providing the critical comment, OPR may require GO/SES endorsement.  In addition, the GO/SES must be available to brief the CSAF if required.  Requirement for GO/SES coordination will be annotated in the JACO tasking email.    2.3.3.  Tasking and Distribution.  When a joint action is received, the JACO reviews the action and determines the most appropriate office to be designated as the OPR.  The action is forwarded to the OPR’s workflow inbox and/or appointed J-Rdr.  The JACO may identify other offices with potential interest in the action as OCRs.  J-Rdrs will review the OCR list and assign the action to the appropriate SME (i.e., AOs).    2.3.4.  Suspenses.  It is critical to meet the JACO/JS suspense since the JS reserves the right to proceed without AF coordination after the suspense date; which in turn could result in commitments of AF time, money, resources or doctrinal positions contrary to our interests.  If an action cannot be completed by the suspense date, an interim reply will be generated and sent to the AF JACO by the JACO suspense. 10    2.3.4.1.  The assigned workflow manager / J-Rdr is responsible for ensuring packages are submitted to the JACO office by the JACO suspense, not the JS suspense.  Figure 2.3. illustrates the timeframe of JACO suspenses allowing time for processing and problem resolution.    Figure 2.3. Timeframe of JACO suspense -  Less than two days = JACO suspense of 1200 hrs on the same day of the JS suspense   -  More than two days, but less than a week = JACO suspense of 1200 hrs the day prior to the JS suspense  -  More than a week = JACO suspense of two days prior to the JS suspense  2.3.4.2.  If an action is turned in after the JACO suspense, the workflow manager / J-Rdr and/or any AOs involved, will remain available to the AF planners, until released, to answer any questions or resolve any discrepancies. 2.3.5.  Requesting Extensions.  Only the JS AO can extend a JS suspense.  Should the OPR require additional time to complete the joint action, the J-Rdr (or OPR) will contact the JS AO directly to request an extension.  The JACO will be notified of the extension via email in order to adjust the suspense accordingly.  Acceptable justification for extensions includes AF-wide coordination or awaiting GO/SES level coordination.  Be advised, extensions may be beyond the control of the JS due to external constraints by Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), SecDef or the President.    2.3.6.  Required Products.  The AO prepares a Joint Action Brief Sheet (JABS), and an AF planners Memorandum (AFPM) (see JACO portal for templates), if required, in response to a joint action.  An AFPM is required anytime the AF vote is anything but a “concur”.  All products should be pulled from the JACO SIPR Portal since these templates may change over time.   2.4.  Transferring Actions.   The OPR has a maximum of 48 hrs (unless it is a “HOT” task – less than 72 hrs) to transfer the joint action to another office if they believe they do not have the greatest interest.  The original OPR will contact the prospective OPR and query the transfer of the assignment.  If both parties agree to the transfer, inform AF JACO of the transfer and JACO will formally reassign the action.  The JACO retains final authority on OPR assignment and will resolve any disagreements or reassign actions as required.  Occasionally, actions arrive which have very little AF interest, or do not fit neatly into any particular Directorate's job description.  However, the AF is still responsible for providing an answer to the JS and JACO will assign the task to the office that has the greatest responsibility for that task.  2.5.  Types of Responses   2.5.1.  There are nine types of responses for joint actions. 11    2.5.1.1.  Preliminary.  The AF AO provides comments directly to the JS AO.  The comments will be approved within the action office chain of command.  The comments may be in the form of a formal memorandum, e-mail message, or verbal communication, depending on what the JS AO requires.  Preliminary coordination does not constitute an official AF position and may be changed during subsequent reviews, but should be consistent with previous AF positions.  No JABS or AFPM is required.  2.5.1.2.  Dual-Tasked Actions.  Some joint actions from the OSD are sent to both the Service Secretaries and the JS for review and comment.  The JS then tasks the Services for comment, resulting in a dual-tasked action (JS and Secretariat processes).  To prevent conflicting positions, the AF replies to dual-tasked actions through the Secretariat chain only (HAF/ES).  The JS 136 TM should show the action as “dual-tasked” and will usually add the following paragraph:  “This is a dual-tasked action addressed to the Service Secretaries and the Joint Staff.  If the Services have not responded by the suspense date or asked for an extension, it is agreed the Services will respond through their Service Secretary.”  The JACO normally sends dual-tasked actions to inform the appropriate workflow and J-Rdrs they will see this action coming through Secretariat channels.  A dual-tasked item does not require any response through the JACO (though it may require a response through the Secretariat channels).  No JABS or AFPM is required.  2.5.1.3.  Information Request.  Some actions require neither approval nor disapproval but are requests for information such as opinions, data, or background papers.  These actions are answered with an AFPM that does not state an AF position (concur or non-concur), but simply provides the requested information.  These actions also require a JABS and any additional attachments.   2.5.1.4.  Concur.  When the AF agrees with an action as written, the vote to the JS is concur.  The JACO notifies the JS of the vote via email with the name of the AF AO, the AF planner approving the vote and the GO/SES, if required.  These actions require only a JABS (no AFPM).    2.5.1.5.  Concur with Comment.  Any time the AF agrees with the joint action but wishes to provide comments, the vote is concur with comment.  Comments are transmitted to the JS on an AFPM.  Each comment must have an accompanying rationale supporting the comment.  The JS is not required to resolve comments on actions with which the AF concurs.  Concur with comment actions also requires a JABS.    2.5.1.6.  Non-concur.  When the AF cannot agree with a joint action unless critical changes are made, the vote is non-concur.  Per CJCSI 5711.01C, a position of non-concur requires the approval of a GO/SES before being transmitted to the JS.  The response must clearly state the reasons for the non-concur.  Should more than one directorate/HAF two-letter/digit organization 12  provide a critical comment, only the OPR GO/SES is required to proceed; however, this does not restrict GO/SES coordination from each directorate providing a critical comment.  The memo may contain additional comments not contributing to the non-concur (if applicable).  Non-concur actions must be conveyed through an AFPM, an Air Force Deputy Operations Deputy Memorandum (AFDODM), an Air Force Operations Deputy Memorandum (AFODM), or a Chief of Staff, Air Force Memorandum (CSAFM), as appropriate.  The J-Rdr assigned as the OPR will ensure a coordinated package with 3-ltr endorsement (except AF/A3/5) prior to submitting to AF JACO.  The assigned planner will verify coordination and send the package to the OPSDEP or CSAF, as required.  Once approved for release, AF JACO will vote to the JS.    2.5.1.7.  Concur subject to the inclusion.  When the AF cannot agree with the joint action unless a single critical change is made, or does not provide alternatives that meet a requirement, the vote is concur subject to the inclusion of the following comment.  This will not be used to bypass the special coordination requirements of a non-concur response and is reserved for unique circumstances, for example, Joint Manning Documents and Joint Tables of Distribution reviews.  2.5.1.8.  Concur as Annotated.  If the changes are minor and non-controversial, and the JS AO agrees, the AF may concur as annotated without transmitting an AFPM.  The procedure to concur as annotated is to mark the changes directly on the document using track changes.  An AF JABS is still required.  2.5.1.9.  Info Only / Copy Provided.  While there is no response required through the JACO, OPRs and OCRs will still review the action to ensure AF equities are adequately addressed.  OPR should forward to all AF organizations with potential interest.  Comments, if required, may be provided directly with the JS AO. 2.6.  Air Force Initiated Actions  2.6.1.  The AF may request actions by the JS or other Services.  AF initiated actions might include requests for JCS Tank meetings, or consideration of AF actions with joint implications.  AF initiated actions are made formally through the JACO under the signature of the planners, DEPOPSDEP, OPSDEP, or CSAF.  Requests are submitted on AFPMs, AFDODM, AFODM, or CSAFM, as required.  AF initiated actions require a JABS to ensure proper coordination.  The JACO will process and track AF initiated actions and deliver them to the appropriate JS offices.  2.6.2.  Referral.  The Secretary, Joint Staff (SJS) is responsible for the information management requirements of the JS decision process.  The SJS receives incoming actions and refers them to a JS Directorate for comment and recommendation.  The SJS provides copies of referrals to the Services for information in anticipation of transmitting a subsequent joint action.  The JACO distributes these documents to interested agencies, but no AF action is required.   13  2.6.3.  Joint Memoranda.  The JACO receives copies of Chairman’s Memoranda (CM), Director, Joint Staff Memoranda (DJSM), and Memoranda in the Name of the Chairman (MCM).  The JACO maintains an archive of these memoranda and distributes copies to interested agencies.  Some of these memoranda may contain joint action tasking and should be answered using the joint action process.  2.6.4.  National Security Presidential Decision (NSPD), Homeland Security Presidential Directive and National Security Presidential Review (NSPR).  These are national security documents released by the President, NSC or HSC establishing national security policy or directing studies or reviews.  These documents are sent and maintained by Service JACOs.  They require special handling, may not be reproduced, and may only be reviewed in the JACO office. 2.7.  OPR/OCRs Process for Completing Joint Actions    2.7.1.  OPR process.  OPRs are required to provide a complete, coordinated AF position to the JACO office and should therefore maintain a Service-wide view when evaluating an action.   2.7.1.1.  Initial review.  The JACO assigned OPR has a maximum of 48 hrs (unless it is a “HOT” task – less than 72 hrs) to transfer the joint action to another office.  Therefore, read the action, note the subject, suspense, the JS AO, and clearly identify the objective.  If action is unclear, contact JS AO for clarification.  Should the OPR believe another office has greater interest, the proposed office must accept the transfer before JACO officially transfers the task.   Review and add to the JACO assigned OCR list, if required, to ensure the response is a complete and holistic AF answer.  Determine OCR suspense by providing adequate time for the OPR to evaluate, consolidate, and resolve any discrepancies (if required) without exceeding the JACO suspense  2.7.1.2.  OCR input.  Review and add additional OCRs, if required, to ensure the response is a complete and holistic AF answer.  Determine task, OPR and required level of coordination.  Provide answer with an AF-wide view and submit to OPR NLT OPR suspense.  Absence of OCR response cannot be construed as concurrence.  However, OPR reserves the right to submit the package to JACO, without OCR input, in order to meet JACO suspense.  2.7.1.3.  Endorsements.  Division-level approval (Division Chief/O-6 equivalent, acting deputy) is the minimum level of endorsement required for all joint actions.  GO/SES endorsement may be requested by the JS or JACO, depending on the type of action and level of endorsement required.  For example, issues going to Tank deliberations or responses to SecDef or Chairman requests will require GO/SES endorsement.  Per CJCSI 5711.01C, a position of non-concur requires the approval of a GO/SES before being transmitted to the JS.  The response must clearly state the reasons for the non-concur.  Should more than one HAF two-letter/digit organization provide a critical comment, only the OPR GO/SES is 14   required to proceed; however, this does not restrict GO/SES coordination from each directorate providing a critical comment.   2.7.2.  OCR process.  OCRs are required to assist the OPR in providing a complete, coordinated AF position.  OCRs will review and submit coordination to the OPR.  OCRs are responsible for securing their directorate HAF two-letter/digit organization GO/SES endorsement for non-concurs prior to submitting coordination to the OPR.  OPR reserves the right to submit the package to JACO, without OCR input, in order to meet JACO suspense. 2.8.  Submitting Joint Actions.   The J-Rdr conducts a quality control check to ensure the position completely answers the joint action, is properly formatted and is fully coordinated.  Packages will be emailed to the “AF/JACO” organizational mailbox (af.jaco@af.pentagon.smil.mil) NLT the JACO suspense.  The J-Rdr and/or AO must be available (until released by the planners) if the action was sent to the JACO after the suspense to answer questions or resolve issues if required.  Submit all required documents, using the proper naming convention (AFPM for SJS 10-10101; JABS for J-5A 10-02345; AF CRM for J-1A 09-08765; etc).  No need to return the original JS documents to the JACO.  Prior to submitting to AF JACO, verify the following items listed in figure 2.4.          Figure 2.4. Items to verify Prior to Submittal to JACO JS question(s) answered from the AF perspective - -  Proper format/grammar/spelling -  Coordinated with all HAF/MAJCOM/FOAs/DRUs with interest -  Clear, specific recommendation -  Classification & markings (classification/declassification instructions, line-item marking, etc) correct, on all documents (JABS, AFPM, any attachments) -  Proper level endorsement 2.9.  AF JACO Tracking and Review.    JACO will conduct a thorough review of all documents.  If the package is incomplete, requires correction, or further coordination, the JACO will return the package to the workflow manager/J-Rdr for corrections.  Make timely corrections and re-submit to JACO with enough time for AF planner review and release to the JS prior to the suspense.   2.10.  Planner Review and Vote.    The AF planners conduct a final review for content, coordination and consistency with AF policy and guidance.  Package will be returned to the originating office for corrections, changes, or further clarification.  Additional coordination may be required before final approval.  Once approved, the JACO “votes” the AF position to the JS.  Voting means transmitting the AF position (i.e AFPM with any attachments, Info paper, electronic transmission) to the JS POC (Cc other Service JACOs, J-Rdrs, AF planners).  JACO retains copies of all transmitted positions.    15  Chapter 3 -- Memoranda, Brief Sheets, and Agenda Packages 3.1.  General Information.  This chapter discusses the administrative procedures for preparing documentation for joint actions, namely the JABS, AFPMs, AFDODMs, AFODMs, and CSAFMs.  All documentation must fully meet security classification marking requirements in accordance with AF Controlled Access Program Coordinating Office (CAPCO) brief (AFIAA/MSO) and AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management (SAF/AAP). 3.2.  Joint Action Brief Sheet (JABS).   The JABS is the AF historical record of the action and is required for every joint action processed by the JACO.  The primary purpose of the JABS is to capture the key points that led to the recommended Service position.  It should be written according to the templates located on the JACO portal page, be a stand-alone document, which means that AOs in the future will be able to review and comprehend the action without verbal explanation.  It is similar to the Staff Summary Sheet, in that it shows the individual offices that coordinated on the action.  The JABS is an internal AF document and should never be transmitted outside of AF channels.  See JACO SIPR Portal for JABS template (https://www.my.af.smil.mil/gcss-af/usaf/ep/globaltab.do?channelpageid=-474624).   3.3.  Air Force Planner’s Memorandum (AFPM)  3.3.1.  The AFPM is the legal vehicle by which the AF officially delivers comments, positions, and information to the JS.  AFPMs are sent to the other Services and maintained as the official record of AF positions on joint actions.  Any verbal agreements between JS and AF AOs, which may change the original action, must be outlined in the AFPM.  See JACO SIPR Portal for AFPM template.    3.3.2.  The AFPM should be kept to a single page. However, if a CRM is not required by the JS, then a multi-page AFPM may be used.  For large documents or inclusion of a CRM, use the AFPM as a cover letter.  Use “line-in/line-out” format to the max extent possible (strikethrough formatting for deletion, and underline additions).  Each comment should contain a criticality and rationale.  Generally accepted criticality comments are listed in figure 3.1.    Figure 3.1. Generally Accepted Comments a.  Critical.  The AF cannot agree to the action until the comment is resolved.  Issue would result in plan failure or long term impact to operational capabilities.  Example:   -  AF-1.  CRITICAL.  The AF cannot provide any of the requested forces without mobilizing Guard or Reserve forces, which would require SecDef approval. -  Rationale:  Request exceeds Service level authority.  b.  Major.  (Only recognized by J-7 Joint Education Doctrine Division) There is a significant problem with the joint action that needs to be resolved, but is not serious  16    enough for a non-concurrence. Usually, the issues are of a philosophical, doctrinal or procedural nature which are significant but do not rise to the level of a critical comment.  However, if not adjudicated to Service satisfaction, Service has option to upgrade to critical.  Examples:   -  AF-1.  MAJOR.  This document does not take into account requirements from NSPD-XX.  A lead agency should be designated for this study. -  Rationale: Accuracy.   c.  Substantive.  There is a significant discrepancy or inaccuracy that needs to be corrected, but is not serious enough for non-concurrence.  Examples:   -  AF-1.  SUBSTANTIVE.  There are no B-52s deployed to Antarctica. -  Rationale: Accuracy.   d.  Administrative.  Grammatical and typographical errors.  If only administrative comments are made, contact the JS AO and determine if they will accept without an AFPM. 3.3.3.  Comments to Operational Plans (OPLAN) will use line-in/line-out format, however some comments may be narrative in nature.  Criticality comments for OPLANs are listed in figure 3.2.     Figure 3.2. Comments for OPLANs a. Execution Critical.  Serious deficiencies that could undermine the capability of a plan to meet the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan objectives and may prevent execution of the plan as written.  b. Substantive.  Deficiencies that include deviations from the CJCS guidance, Joint Operations Planning and Execution System format, or errors involving the Time Phased Force Deployment Data, but would not prevent plan execution.  c. Administrative.  Comments for clarity, accuracy, or consistency.     3.3.4.  Information Provided AFPM.  The JS frequently requests information not requiring a vote of concurrence or non-concurrence.  The AFPM either contains the requested information or serves as a cover memo for the information in the form of an attachment.  A cover memo need only contain a simple statement indicating the information requested in the joint action is attached.  The body of the AFPM should be brief, examples are listed in figure 3.3.  Figure 3.3. Examples of AFPM 1.  The Air Force provides the requested information in the attached document.  2.  The AF POC for this subject is Capt Johnny Ringo. 17  3.4.  Joint Service Planner’s Memo.   The format is similar to an AFPM, but the letter is prepared by the JS and signed by all four Services on plain bond paper with a tracking block for each Service.   3.5.  AF Operations Deputy Memorandum/AF Deputy Operations Deputy Memorandum. The AFODM is the GO level correspondence addressed to the DJS and an AFDODM is addressed to the VDJS.  The formats are essentially identical to an AFPM and may contain the same types of information.  AFODMs and AFDODMs usually do not include an AF Point of Contact (POC) line.   3.6.  Chief of Staff, Air Force Memorandum.   The highest level memorandum the AF can transmit to the JS is the CSAFM.  The CSAFM is addressed to the CJCS.  CSAFMs are used to convey the AF position on weighty issues requiring intervention of the CJCS.  The body of a CSAFM is a narrative without comments, criticalities, or rationale.  The comment and rationale are written in narrative form.  See HOI 33-3, Correspondence Preparation, Control and Tracking, for detailed instructions in the preparation of an Official Memorandum for the CSAF.  The CSAFM is assigned a tracking number and will be printed on Office of the Chief of Staff letterhead with either the CSAF or Vice CSAF (VCSAF) signature block. Chapter 4 -- Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Meeting Process (Tanks) 4.1.  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff JCS Meetings   4.1.1.  Title 10 of the United States Code directs the CJCS to convene regular meetings of the JCS.  They meet with the President, members of the NSC, Ambassadors, the SecDef, Combatant Commanders, and other distinguished visitors.  The JCS, OPSDEP, and DEPOPSDEP meet on a regular basis to share important information, resolve issues, formulate military advice for the President and SecDef, and reach consensus on joint matters.  The meetings are held in the JCS conference room most commonly known as the “Tank.”  Attendance is closely controlled by JS established policy and guidance.  4.1.2.  Regularly scheduled and special meetings will be held due to the reasons listed in figure 4.1.    Figure 4.1. Reasons for a Tank -  Address unresolved issues that are best resolved in joint deliberations as opposed to bilateral discussions. -  Review a proposed joint action of such significance that the issues should be specifically addressed by a joint meeting. -  Discuss matters of significance among themselves and with United States Government and foreign officials, including appropriate briefings and reports.  4.1.3.  For issues scheduled for formal JCS consideration, the AF planners, with the help of the assigned SME, will be responsible for the items listed in figure 4.2.  18   Figure 4.2. Tank Responsibilities for AF Planner -  Ensure Brief Sheets and Briefing Facers are prepared for each principal attendee. -  Ensure Service coordination is accomplished with the proper AF organizations.  All AF offices, on matters within their area of responsibility, assist the SME as necessary to prepare the final AF position. -  Pre-brief the CSAF, OPSDEP, or DEPOPSDEP prior to all Tank sessions (SME attendance when directed by planner). -  Be debriefed by the JCS principals and disseminate taskings or feedback to the appropriate AF organizations, following all Tank sessions (SME attendance when directed by planner). -  To process items under formal consideration (Tanks), take the following steps: Special Assistant for Joint Matters (SAJM) distributes approved briefings and JACO will send Status Report to J-Rdrs and workflows daily and designate 1) Status Report to Service JACOs 2) OPRs for each Tank Topic 3)  AF JACO will route briefings to AF/A3/5 and designated OPR/SMEs 4)  AF SME will review briefing, and with the assistance of their respective J-Rdr, prepare the Brief Sheet & Briefing Facers, gain 3-ltr endorsement and submit to AF JACO NLT suspense annotated on the Status Report; packages requiring AF/A3/5 or CSAF endorsement will be sent to JACO and AF planner will submit to AF/A3/5 or CSAF endorsement (as req).  J-Rdrs should assist SMEs with the correct formatting, templates and quality review of the materials prior to submission to JACO/planner.  It is essential for Tank products to include the “View of Others”.  5) JACO will review and submit to AF planner for final review and release 6)  AF planner will release final package to JACO for printing (Tank book) 7)  AF SME will pre-brief with AF planner (may be required to accompany AF planner to pre-brief with AF Principal) 8)  OPSDEP Tank attendees include principal + planner; JCS Tank attendees are the Service Chiefs (+ 1 attendee must be submitted by the Service Chief and is at the discretion of the CJCS) 9) be invited to attend the debrief) 10) 11)  AF/A3/5 initiates implementation of the decision and HAF/MAJCOMs/DRUs, FOAs follow as required Following the Tank, AF planner will debrief with the principal (AF SME may JS issues implementing memorandum based on Tank results  4.1.4.  DEPOPSDEPS Tank Meetings.  The lowest level Tank meeting is at the two-star level.  The DEPOPSDEPS Tank is chaired by the VDJS, with the Deputy AF/A3/5 as the AF representative.  planners or other representatives are permitted to attend “by invitation only” and at the discretion of the VDJS.  Executive sessions are for principals only.  4.1.5.  OPSDEPS Tank Meetings.  The three-star level Tank meeting is chaired by the DJS, with the AF/A3/5 as the AF representative.  The alternate representative is the Deputy AF/A3/5.  Planners and other representatives are permitted to attend “by invitation only” and at the discretion of the DJS.  Executive sessions are for principals only. 19   4.1.6.  JCS Tank Meetings.  The highest level Tank meeting occurs at the four-star level.  The SecDef, DepSecDef, and Vice CJCS (VCJCS) may attend these meetings.  The CJCS convenes and presides over the meeting.  In the absence of the CJCS, the VCJCS presides.  The AF representative to these meetings is the CSAF or the VCSAF.  If neither is available, per JCS direction, the seat will remain unfilled.  Other GO/SESs are permitted to attend “by invitation of their respective Service Chiefs” and as approved by the CJCS.  Executive sessions are attended exclusively by the JCS. 4.2.  Tank Agenda  4.2.1.  Tank Schedule.  The CJCS is responsible for establishing the agenda for Tank sessions, but the authority for the day-to-day management of the Tank agenda is delegated to the DJS, for JCS and OPSDEPs meetings; and to the Vice Director for DEPOPSDEPs meetings.  Deviations to this schedule are coordinated and accommodated as required.  Additional meetings may be scheduled as the need arises.  A typical Tank week includes:  JCS – Monday and Friday at 1430; OPSDEPS – Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 1000.  4.2.2.  Status Report.  JCS and subordinate meetings are published daily in the Status Report which contains the projected schedule for JCS, OPSDEP, and DEPOPSDEP Tank meetings (approximately two weeks).  The Status Report is published by the SAJM and distributed daily by AF JACO to all HAF two-letter/digit organization workflow managers / J-Rdrs.  Changes are annotated in Blue Font and will be reviewed by all J-Rdrs to determine role and/or action. 4.3.  Tank Process & Procedures   4.3.1.  OPR Assignment.  AF JACO assigns a 3-letter OPR for each topic.  The directorate determines the appropriate SME, passes the name, office, and phone to JACO.    4.3.2.  Tank Products.  The appropriate SME (with the help of their J-Rdr) prepares a JCS/OPSDEP Brief Sheet, briefing slide Facers (see JACO Portal for templates) to the planned brief (continuously check with AF JACO for the most current brief) and any supporting documentation to the AF JACO by the assigned Product Delivery Date (PDD) annotated on the JACO email and reflected on the daily Status Report.  The SME is responsible for contacting the JS AO and other Service AOs to ensure a complete understanding of the context and content of the issue, as well as the other Service positions. It is essential for Tank products to include the “View of Others”. Tank Brief Sheets serve as the official history of the AF position on Tank issues.  The AF planner will review the briefing package (Brief Sheet & Facers) and once approved, send to AF JACO for assembly into the AF principal’s Tank book.    4.3.3.  Briefing Slides.  SAJM is the focal point for briefing slides and any updates.  However, only the JACO will interact with SAJM regarding Tank matters.  The JACO will distribute the planned briefings and updates to the SMEs once they become 20  available.  The SME may obtain draft briefing slides directly from the JS POC (identified under each topic) indicated on the Status Report or directly from the SIPR Tank portal (http://sdseportal.js.smil.mil/portal/site/jsportal/tank/)  4.3.4.  Coordination.  The SME is expected to gain an AF-wide coordinated response and 3-ltr approval prior to submitting to the AF JACO.  Close coordination with the AF planner while writing the Brief Sheet & Facers will ensure the best possible coverage of the topic and preparation for the AF principal.    4.3.5.  Suspense.  The SME must deliver the completed JCS Brief Sheet & Facers to the JACO no later than PDD annotated on the Status Report (normally 1200 the day prior to the Tank).  4.3.6.  Pre-Briefs.  The SME will pre-brief with the AF planner as annotated on the Status Report (normally 30 minutes prior to principal pre-brief but may occur the day prior).  Be prepared to discuss the issue, history, coordination of the topic, and present any last-minute changes to the Brief Sheet.  The planner normally pre-briefs the principal attendee (GO attending the Tank) on the day of the Tank (typically 30 minutes prior to the Tank meeting) and may require the SME to attend.  The SME must be prepared to answer questions related to the Brief Sheet/Facers directly to the Deputy AF/A3/5, AF/A3/5, VCSAF, or CSAF, as required.  4.3.7.  Debrief.  Following the Tank, the AF principal normally out briefs the results with the AF planner (SMEs may be invited to attend de-briefs).  Occasionally, the principal may give Tank taskings, which the AF planner assigns to the appropriate HAF directorate.  The planner, with the assistance of the SME, will produce a Tank summary for inclusion into the CSAF Weekly Voted Report book.  AF JACO will monitor the Tank taskers, and with the assistance of the SME and J-Rdr, update the Tank tasker tracker for inclusion into the CSAF Weekly Voted Report book.   4.4.  Service-Initiated Meetings.   The Services may request agenda items for Tank meetings on topics of joint interest or require joint resolution.  If the VDJS, DJS, or CJCS, respectively, believe the topic is appropriate for a Tank meeting, the item will be added to the agenda.  These requests are made formally through the AF JACO in accordance with the JS Tank webpage.  JACO will submit AF initiated Tank Topic nominations for JS consideration.  JACO is charged with providing guidance, tracking, and approval of all AF initiatives to the JS and JCS principals. 4.5.  JCS Decision Implementation.   Implementing memoranda and messages addressed to the AF result from JCS decisions and are directive in nature.  In effect, the CSAF, as a member of the JCS, has committed the AF to take the required action.  Some of these memoranda may contain joint action tasking and should be answered using the joint action process.  When an implementing directive is received, the JACO assigns to the appropriate HAF office.    21  4.6.  Adopted Forms.  JS Form 136, Joint Staff Action Processing Form.                WILLIAM A.

Agenda Item - A subject for formal consideration by the DEPOPSDEPS, OPSDEPS, or JCS Tank.  It may also include discussions with various dignitaries (e.g., an Ambassador, an Assistant Secretary of Defense, or a Combatant Commander).   Air Force DEPOPSDEPS Memorandum (AFDODM) - A numbered memo signed by the AF DEPOPSDEPS (processed and forwarded by the JACO) communicating his views on joint issues.  Air Force OPSDEPS Memorandum (AFODM) - A numbered memo signed by the AF OPSDEPS (processed and forwarded by the JACO) communicates his views on joint issues.   Air Force Planner’s Memorandum (AFPM) - The official Service-level memorandum to the JS, signed by planners, documenting an official Air Force position or request on a joint matter.  Sister Service planners are provided a copy of the Service response.  Air Force Planners for Joint and NSC Matters - Air Force colonels, under the OPSDEPs and DEPOPSDEPs, are accredited to the JS to speak for the CSAF, OPSDEP and DEPOPSDEP on joint matters.  The planners support the DEPOPSDEP, OPSDEP and CSAF in the discharge of their statutory and assigned functions.  Planners are the lowest level within the Air Force authorized to present the Service position on joint matters to the JS and other Services.    Air Staff (AS) - Offices below the Secretariat level (under and including the CSAF).  Background Paper - Paper included in a JCS brief package to provide a chronological evolution of an issue, a summary of the paper, or related data and rationale, designed to assist in the  23  understanding of the issue.   See AFH 33-337, “Tongue and Quill,” for examples of background papers.  Brief Sheet - A brief one/two page summary describing the Issue, Background, Key Points, AF Views, Views of Others and Recommendations to prepare the AF principal for Tank deliberations (see JACO Portal for templates).  Briefing Slide Facers - A callout inserted on-top of a briefing slide to highlight something to the AF principal.  Common callouts include a spelled out acronym, specific or previous AF position, or general information providing clarity to the slide.  The format and color is specific (see JACO Portal for templates).  Chief of Staff, Air Force Memorandum (CSAFM) - An official memorandum used by the CSAF to present problems, information, comments, and recommendations to the JCS.  Prepared on CSAF letterhead and processed by the JACO.   Concur/Concur with Comments/Non-concur - This is an expression of agreement/disagreement with a proposed action.  JS Directorates, defense agencies, and the Services may concur or non-concur with proposed actions on which their coordination is sought or a vote is required.   Coordination - The process through which interested and affected organizations contribute to and comment on joint actions.  Coordination with the Services gives the Service Chiefs an opportunity to fulfill their statutory roles as members of the JCS, and ensures that the CJCS is made aware of their views.    Chief of Staff, Army, Memorandum (CSAM) -.  CSAMs are used by the CSA to present problems, information, comments and recommendations to the JCS.   Debrief - An oral presentation between the AF principal attendee with the AF planner to discuss the results of the DEPOPSDEPS, OPSDEPS, or JCS Tank.  Planners may require SMEs to attend the Tank debrief, therefore they will remain on-call until released by the planner.    Deputy Operations Deputies (DEPOPSDEPS) - Subsidiary body known as the Deputy Operations Deputies (DEPOPSDEPs), composed of the VDJS and a two-star flag or general officer appointed by each Service Chief. Currently, the DEPOPSDEPs are the Service directors for plans. Issues come before the DEPOPSDEPs to be settled at their level or forwarded to the OPSDEPS. Except for the VDJS, the DEPOPSDEPs are not part of the JS.  The AF DEPOPSDEPS is the Assistant DCS, Operations, Plans and Requirements (Deputy AF/A3/5).   Director, Joint Staff Memorandum (DJSM) - A numbered memo written and forwarded by DJS.  Memo may be in response to a Service inquiry or to forward information pertaining to a JS issue.

Joint Action Brief Sheet (JABS) - A form used by the JACO to document the Air Force response to a joint action.  The JABS summarizes the Air Force position, equities, and recommendation, and documents the coordination history within the USAF.    Joint Action Control Office (JACO) – The Services’ administrative single point of contact between the JS and the Service for all joint matters under consideration by the JCS.  Manages the CSAF’s administrative process to formulate Air Force positions on all JCS & NSC matters.    Joint Reader (J-Rdr) - An experienced action officer, designated (in writing no lower than by 3-ltr) as the HAF organizational single point of contact for joint matters within that organization. J-Rdrs have final coordination authority on all JCS matters for their HAF element.  J-Rdrs are authorized to coordinate directly across the HAF on joint matters.  JCS Message - Messages from the JS or addressed to JS for action.  Responsibility for action is assigned by the JACO.   Joint Staff (JS) - Organized along conventional staff lines to support the CJCS, but has no executive authority to operate as an overall Armed Forces general staff.
