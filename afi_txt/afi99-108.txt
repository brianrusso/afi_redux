SUMMARY OF CHANGESAFI 99-108 is updated to incorporate guidance in AFI 99-103, Capabilities Based Test and Evaluation.The new term “presentation authorization” (PA) is introduced. A new complementary instruction, AFI99-120, Forecasting and Programming Munitions Telemetry and Flight Termination Systems, was createdto address funding and programming issues regarding the use of a Telemetry (TM) Instrumentation Kit(TIK) and/or Flight Termination System (FTS) during developmental and operational test and evaluationof munitions. 21.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.Figure 1.9...................Planning for Aerial Target and Air-to-Air (A-A) Missile Expenditures.....................................................................Applicable Aerial Targets and Missiles...................................Programs Requiring Aerial Target and Missile Expenditures.......................Responsibilities in the Aerial Target and Missile Allocation Process.........................MAJCOM/AFOTEC Guidance for Using Allocated Aerial Targets..........................MAJCOM/AFOTEC Guidance for Expending Allocated Missiles........................................Semi-Annual Aerial Target / Missile Expenditure Report.............................................Summary of Kill / Presentation Authorization Process.KA/PA and Aerial Target Acquisition Process ...........................................................Summary of Aerial Target Acquisition Process........................................................Attachment 1— GLOSSARY OF REFERENCES AND SUPPORTING INFORMATION  Attachment 2— AERIAL TARGET / MISSILE REQUEST FORMAT  Attachment 3— ANNUAL AERIAL TARGET ALLOCATIONS LETTER EXAMPLE  Attachment 4— SEMI-ANNUAL AERIAL TARGET / MISSILE EXPENDITURE REPORT FORMAT  Attachment 5— KILL / PRESENTATION AUTHORIZATION CALCULATIONS  AFI99-108   1 MARCH 2007 33336667 78 9 12 14 18 19AFI99-108   1 MARCH 200731.  Planning for Aerial Target and Air-to-Air (A-A) Missile Expenditures. The Air Force has manycomplex aircraft weapon systems requiring constant exercise to ensure their satisfactory performance inoperational units. The Air Force must thoroughly test new and modified systems to ensure they meet userrequirements. As these systems become more complex, and as tactical demands multiply, there is anincrease in quantity of the aerial targets MAJCOMs must expend to evaluate these systems in test andevaluation (T&E) programs. To improve the means by which the Air Force ensures weapon combat capa-bility, each MAJCOM and AFOTEC must establish a program to justify their operational requirementsand manage the targets it expends. For planning purposes, the Air Force considers every missile expendi-ture a T&E event. 2.  Applicable Aerial Targets and Missiles. This instruction only applies to missiles removed from warreserve materiel (WRM) for any test program. MAJCOMs and AFOTEC will not include missiles pro-cured directly from a contractor, specifically for the developmental test or operational test of that missile,in the missile expenditure requests and reports. This instruction applies to the following types of aerialtargets and missiles: 2.1.  Subscale Aerial Target (SSAT): BQM-34; MQM-107; BQM-167 (Air Force Subscale AerialTarget: AFSAT). 2.2.  Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT): QF-4; Air Superiority Target (AST). 2.3.  Air Intercept Missile (AIM): AIM-7, AIM-9, AIM-120. 3.  Programs Requiring Aerial Target and Missile Expenditures. The principal T&E programs inwhich the Air Force expends its A-A missiles, aerial targets, and supporting resources on are developmen-tal and operational testing and WSEP. NOTE: In this instruction, the term WSEP includes William Telland the USAF Weapons Instructor Course (WIC) missile firings. 3.1.  The Role of WSEP in Test and Evaluation. Air Combat Command (ACC) conducts WSEP todetermine the overall operational effectiveness and suitability of fully integrated fielded weapon sys-tems in realistic operational scenarios while enhancing training. The goal of WSEP is to evaluate eachweapon system within 12 months after fielding and continuing throughout its operational life cycle,using line of the Air Force crews, aircraft, and weapons. Although training is an important part ofWSEP, it is a secondary objective. The primary objective is to gather effectiveness and suitability dataon the complete weapons system. To achieve the primary objective, ACC/A3TW and the 53d Weap-ons Evaluation Group (53 WEG) will: 3.1.1.  Maintain an accurate missile firing database to support Air Force decision makers regard-ing operational capabilities, force structure recommendations, required material modifications,and requirements for new equipment. 3.1.2.  Ensure the accuracy of the database. As a goal, ACC should normally conduct enough mis-sile firings to define the probability of mission success (Pms) of each aircraft/missile combination. 3.1.3.  Provide accurate test data for determining the operational effectiveness and suitability ofeach weapon system. 3.1.4.  Identify weapon system deficiencies, determine causes, and make recommendations forimproving operational effectiveness and suitability. 4.  Responsibilities in the Aerial Target and Missile Allocation Process.  4AFI99-108   1 MARCH 20074.1.  MAJCOM and AFOTEC Responsibilities for Planning Expenditure Requirements. EachMAJCOM and AFOTEC will prepare an eight-year plan to identify and justify the types of aerial tar-gets and missiles required for its T&E programs. In preparing this plan, consider system designrequirements, test program objectives, present and future threats, aircraft resources, missile resources,target resources, range facilities, past WSEP results, and results from other test programs. 4.1.1.  Each MAJCOM and AFOTEC must establish the necessary coordination and review proce-dures to ensure projected expenditures are: 4.1.1.1.  Prioritized according to MAJCOM and AFOTEC requirements. 4.1.1.2.  Based on current operational tactics, scenarios, and concepts of operations. 4.1.1.3.  Realistic and conform to weapon system evaluation and other test program needs. 4.1.1.4.  Based on the need to determine weapon system effectiveness. The expendituresshould be the absolute minimum required to meet test objectives or weapons system evalua-tion requirements. 4.1.1.5.  Based on data collected from previous firing programs and adjusted to fit the plannedemployment environment. 4.1.1.6.  Realistic considering the limited availability of assets. 4.1.1.7.  Based on warranty expiration considerations, if no overriding program guidance. 4.2.  MAJCOM and AFOTEC Directions for the Expenditure Request Format. The aerial tar-get and missile expenditure request must contain the items listed in Attachment 2. The MAJCOM orAFOTEC then forwards this request to HQ USAF/TEP for review and validation. The target/missilerequest must arrive at HQ USAF/TEP no later than 1 March of each year. For all Air Force MaterielCommand (AFMC) conducted developmental test programs, the system program office (SPO) willinclude the requested targets/missiles in the appropriate Test and Evaluation Master Plan (TEMP). Forall HQ Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) conducted operational test pro-grams, HQ AFOTEC/XPR will request targets/missiles as described above and will ensure thatrequired assets are listed in the Test Resource Plan (TRP). For all MAJCOM-conducted force devel-opment evaluations (FDE), the MAJCOM will request targets/missiles as described above and will listrequired targets in the TEMP, TRP, test plan, or COMACC Plan 85 for WSEP. NOTE: Inclusion of therequest in the approved TEMP, TRP, test plan, or COMACC Plan 85 does not automatically providetarget/missile support. Only direct aerial target allocation from HQ USAF/TEP and direct missile allo-cation from HAF/A5RW ensures support. 4.3.  HQ USAF Responsibilities.  4.3.1.  HQ USAF/TEP will : 4.3.1.1.  Aerial Target Allocations.  4.3.1.1.1.  Allocate aerial targets for all T&E programs including WSEP. Aerial target andassociated munition items inventories do not allow 100 % support of all target requests.Therefore, HQ USAF/TEP will track historical target usage rates versus requests and willallocate targets based on these numbers and USAF priorities. HQ USAF/TEP will sendfinal written target allocations to all MAJCOMs and AFOTEC before the beginning ofeach fiscal year (FY). AFI99-108   1 MARCH 200754.3.1.1.2.  Coordinate with ACC/A8X prior to publishing the annual aerial target alloca-tion letter. 4.3.1.1.3.  Issue a kill authorization (KA) when the expectation is that the unmanned targetwill be lost during the mission. A KA may be issued even if the potential of saving the tar-get through survivability maneuvers is likely. Even if no kill is anticipated, an aerial targetthat is on a “critical profile” as defined by AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations and Reports,requires a KA for launch. 4.3.1.1.4.  Issue a presentation authorization (PA) when there is not an expectation that theunmanned target will be lost during the mission. A PA will be issued if there are no liveweapons fired at the target or weapons are planned to be terminated or kinematicallydefeated prior to impact. 4.3.1.1.5.  Require that programs obtain a KA or PA prior to launching an unmanned tar-get. 4.3.1.2.  Missile Allocations.  4.3.1.2.1.  Review and validate all test missile expenditure requests. The purpose of thisvalidation is to ensure the missile request is a legitimate T&E requirement. HQ USAF/TEPthen forwards the request to HQ USAF/A5RW. Procedures for forecasting and program-ming the air-to-air missiles telemetry and flight termination system are found inAFI 99-120. 4.3.2.  HQ USAF/A5RW will:  4.3.2.1.  Missile Allocations.  4.3.2.1.1.  Include the missile expenditure allocations in the annual USAF Tactical AirMissile Program (TAMP) document if the request is 100% supportable. 4.3.2.1.2.  Coordinate with HQ USAF/TEP, MAJCOM, and AFOTEC to determine priori-ties and resolve disconnects if the request is not 100% supportable. 4.4.  Defense Component, Command, and Agency Responsibilities. Any Department of Defense(DoD) component, command, or agency (i.e. Army, Navy, Northern Command) requiring Air Forceaerial targets on a recurring basis will request the targets as described above. These organizations willprovide procurement funds to the aerial targets system program office (691st Armament SystemsSquadron (691 ARSS)) at least two years before the need date to allow the SPO sufficient time toincrease the next planned production buy. For operations and maintenance costs, the using componentwill coordinate costs with the 53 WEG, ACC/A8X, and HQ USAF/TEP. 4.5.  MAJCOM and HQ USAF Responsibilities for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Programs.Each MAJCOM will request the targets they need for conducting FMS programs. When a foreign mil-itary program destroys an aerial target, whether intentional or not, the 53 WEG will advise the MAJ-COM responsible for the FMS program, which in turn, notifies the FMS case manager in SAF/IA orAir Force Security Assistance Center (AFSAC). The SAF/IA FMS or AFSAC case manager then billsthe foreign government for items expended. Once the foreign government has been billed and fundsare on deposit, the MAJCOM aerial targets line manager (as identified in the FMS case) is responsiblefor getting these funds back to 691 ARSS. The line manager obtains a fund cite from 691 ARSS and6AFI99-108   1 MARCH 2007transfers money from the FMS account to 691 ARSS. The 691 ARSS uses the reimbursement funds topurchase replacement targets during the next production buy. 5.  MAJCOM/AFOTEC Guidance for Using Allocated Aerial Targets.  5.1.  Aerial Target Allocation Deviations. Deviations from target allocations require HQ USAF/TEP coordination. 5.1.1.  Interchanging subscale aerial targets for full-scale aerial targets and vice-versa by any usingagency (MAJCOM, AFOTEC, 53 WEG, DoD Agency) requires HQ USAF/TEP approval. Excep-tion: The 53 WEG may interchange subscale aerial target types or models between programs pro-vided they do not exceed total annual SSAT expenditure limits and are still able to meet userprofile requirements. 5.2.  Aerial Target Survivability Measures. Test organizations, program managers, and the53 WEG will build target survivability maneuvers into every missile shot profile that does not havespecific endgame requirements. 5.3.  Special Aerial Target Procedures. Target allocations not used in one fiscal year do not carryover to the next fiscal year. HQ USAF/TEP will provide a new set of allocations for each fiscal yearin an annual Fiscal Year Target Allocations letter. An example of this letter is shown in Attachment3. Test programs that slip from one fiscal year to the next must submit a new request each year. 5.4.  Unprogrammed Aerial Target Requirements. MAJCOMs and AFOTEC will first try to fillunprogrammed target requirements (also known as out-of-cycle requests) from existing, current-yearallocations. When the MAJCOM or AFOTEC cannot fill unprogrammed requirements, they mustsubmit a request to HQ USAF/TEP. HQ USAF/TEP may authorize additional allocations provided therequirement is valid and inventories permit once the MAJCOM or AFOTEC has expended all othertargets of the type requested. 6.  MAJCOM/AFOTEC Guidance for Expending Allocated Missiles.  6.1.  Missile Allocation Deviations. Commands will not exceed programmed allocations from theTAMP without HQ USAF/TEP coordination and HQ USAF/A5RW approval. 6.2.  Special Missile Procedures. Missile allocations not used in one fiscal year do not carry over tothe next fiscal year. The MAJCOM/AFOTEC will have to request new allocations. The one exceptionto this is when the missile has already been shipped to the test location and it has been configured(with telemetry, flight termination system, or other special equipment) for the test. 6.3.  Unprogrammed Missile Expenditure Requirements. MAJCOMs/AFOTEC should first try tofill unprogrammed missile requirements (also known as out-of-cycle requests) from existing cur-rent-year allocations. When unprogrammed requirements cannot be met, MAJCOM/AFOTEC mustsubmit a request for additional allocations to HQ USAF/TEP who will validate the request and for-ward the recommendation to USAF/A5RW for approval. For guidance on funding and programmingthe missile telemetry and FTS kits, see AFI 99-120. 7.  Semi-Annual Aerial Target / Missile Expenditure Report. All MAJCOMs and AFOTEC must sub-mit a semi-annual report of all target and missile expenditures by 1 May and 1 November. Attachment 4lists the items required in these reports. AFI99-108   1 MARCH 200778.  Summary of Kill / Presentation Authorization Process. The current KA/PA process is shown inFigure 1.. Each test program requests through their appropriate MAJCOM/AFOTEC the number of KA/PA’s that are needed for the next eight years. The number of drones requested should be documented ineither an approved TEMP, TRP, or test plan. Programs should calculate the number of KA/PAs requestedas shown in Attachment 5. At the Aerial Targets KA/PA Conference and at the Tactical Air Missile Pro-gram (TAMP) Conference in the spring of each year, the HQ and MAJCOMs/AFOTEC discuss therequested number of aerial targets for each program as well as the expected expenditures. After consulta-tion with the 53 WEG, the MAJCOMs/AFOTEC, and based upon current and projected inventory levels(as well as the priority of test programs), HQ AF/TEP will issue the KAs/PAs by 30 September each year.Programs then use the KA/PAs throughout the FY to test against aerial targets. Figure 1.  KA/PA and Aerial Target Acquisition Process 8AFI99-108   1 MARCH 20079.  Summary of Aerial Target Acquisition Process. The aerial target acquisition process fits into theKA/PA process in an indirect manner. ACC/A8X monitors the drone inventory and projected targetexpenditures to finalize ACC’s budget request into the Air Force Program Objective Memorandum(POM) submission. When Congress approves the President’s Budget, ACC/A8X authorizes the aerial tar-get squadron (program office) of the air-to-air missile system wing to purchase aerial targets which thenenter the inventory after delivery from the aerial target contractor.

USAF aerial targets support a variety of test and evaluation programs and are critical assets in ensuring weapon system effectiveness and suitability. In order to preserve present and future aerial target capabili-ties, we must adhere to a disciplined, efficient process for the allocation of these scarce resources. HQ USAF/TEP, IAW AFI 99-108, allocates the aerial targets to AF and AF-sponsored customers. 2. The objective of the process is to provide an Air Force-wide forum for a detailed and comprehensive review of planned test objectives. At the 2005 Tactical Air Missile Program (TAMP) Conference at Rob-ins AFB, GA, each customer (AFMC, ACC, and AFOTEC) presented their FY06-FY13 aerial target and missile requirements. The 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) provided historical data and projected usage rates for the full-scale aerial targets (FSAT) and the sub-scale aerial targets (SSAT). All of this data was used by AF/TEP to develop the FY06 allocation computations and establish the kill authorizations (KA) and presentation authorizations (PA) for FY06. 3. The PA is a term defining an authorization with the expectation that the target will not be damaged or destroyed. Typical examples would include those presentations in which the target is not fired upon, mis-sile is terminated before impact, or target is out of missile kinematic range at missile flyout. Until official policy governing PAs is formalized, requests will be accepted and PAs issued on a case-by-case basis. Any program that expends a target with a PA must notify AF/TEP immediately after the mission is com-plete. 4. KA/PAs for FY06 expire at the end of the fiscal year. Air Force KA/PAs are for all targets owned and operated by the Air Force on either the Eglin Gulf Range or the Whites Sands Missile Range (WSMR). Each MAJCOM/AFOTEC is responsible for maintaining their test program(s) (including sponsored FMS testing) within the yearly allocations. Swaps between programs, within the MAJCOM/AFOTEC, will be coordinated with AF/TEP by appropriately addressed message or memorandum via e-mail or regular mail. Any additional requirements, not covered by the annual allocation, will be addressed via an out-of-cycle request IAW AFI 99-108. AFI99-108   1 MARCH 20075. FY06 allocations are as follows: 15Command Program ACC/A3 WSEP/WIC FSAT KA(s) 5* SSAT KA(s) 20 FSAT PA (s) SSAT PA(s) Notes *1 x FSAT KA rolled over from FY05 ACC/A3 ACC/A3 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 ACC/A8 & AFOTEC AFOTEC AFMC AFMC FMS Combat Archer (Canada, Germany, Singapore, Taiwan) Amalgam Virgo AATC AIM-9X AMRAAM FOT&E F-16 OFP FEP F-15 OFP/CTF F-15C V2/3 OFP F/A-22 FOT&E and FDE A-10 AIM-9X AAMSW: AMRAAMAerial Targets AFMC AFMC AFMC AFRL F-16 FMS F-16 SPO AFMC JSF Planned Navy Total 4 2 2 1 2 2 1 2    2** 2 2   5* 1* 46 2 NORTHCOM * 1 x FSAT KA rolled over from FY05 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 * 1 x FSAT KA rolled over from FY05 * 4 x FSAT KAs rolled over from FY05 * 3 x FSAT KAs rolled over from FY05**BQM-167A test *2 x SSAT KAs rolled over from FY05   1*  *Aegis 10 11 1* 2 3 1* 6* 2 6* 5 31 16AFI99-108   1 MARCH 20076. In FY05, the Navy began utilizing Air Force QF-4s at Tyndall AFB, FL and WSMR due to Navy QF-4s retiring from NAS Point Mugu, CA in Jun 04. Navy representatives have coordinated QF-4 purchases and utilizations, which are documented in Memorandum of Understanding for Air Force/Navy Interservice QF-4 Full-Scale Aerial Target Program Production Lots 9-15 Allocation and Support, AAMSW-2005-001, 15 Apr 05. Additionally, the Air Force and Navy have traded aerial targets through Memorandum of Agreements (MOAs). Army and Navy-purchased aerial targets and AF-pay-back-to-Navy trades are listed as follows: Army/Navy Aerial TargetsQF-4 Accounting Army purchased prior to FY04 Total AF owed to Army Navy purchased prior to FY04 Navy purchased for FY05 delivery Navy purchased for FY06 delivery AF owed to Navy from trades  Total AF owed to Navy FSAT  SSAT  Notes 1 1 5 4 5 14* 8  Aegis MOA, 20 May 05:8 x BQM-167, 12 x BQM-34, or 12 x MQM-107 See para 7.

AF programs requiring SSAT target support at another range, (i.e. Navy ranges such as Point Mugu or China Lake) must first obtain an AF KA/PA and facilitate a MOA between the AF and the aerial target supplier. AF customers using other services’ targets should not expect automatic “payback” of future AF targets to that service. If target “payback” is necessary, requests must be coordinated with ample lead-time, MAJCOM/AFOTEC support, and guidance from AF/TEP. Targets used for “payback” apply to the basic airframe and engine only. EA, IR expendables and other such requirements must be handled directly with the target operating agency or hardware supplier. Programs desiring to purchase targets and equipment directly from a non-Air Force source, need not coordinate KA/PAs with AF/TEP; all responsi-bilities are borne by the customer. 9. To efficiently manage the limited target assets, MAJCOMs/AFOTEC will inform AF/TEP and ACC/A8X upon completion of the requirements for which the KA/PA was allocated. Unexpended KAs will be AFI99-108   1 MARCH 200717used to support other FY06 requirements and out-of-cycle requests as prioritized by AF/TEP. If, for exam-ple, AMRAAM completes the original test shot matrix within the FY and do not expend all the allocated KAs, the unused KAs are returned to the HQ test pool. The AMRAAM program does not retain the KAs for “pop-up” test requirements later in the year. 10. Careful management of our limited aerial target inventory is required. Out-of-cycle KAs will be closely scrutinized. To help preserve assets, drone-saving maneuvers should be planned and executed to the maximum extent possible. Missiles should be flown to impact only when absolutely required to obtain test data. 11. Questions should be directed to Lt Col Jane Smith, HQ AF/TEP, DSN 227-0208, Commercial (703) 697-0208.

Each MAJCOM and AFOTEC will submit a semi-annual report of target and missile expendituresno later than 1 May and 1 November. HQ USAF/TEP will ensure HQ USAF/A5RW receives a copy ofthis report. No specific format is required; however, each report will contain the following items: A4.1.1.  DATE.  A4.1.2.  COMMAND/ORGANIZATION.  A4.1.3.  PROGRAM TITLE/PROGRAM ELEMENT. Include the program title and element codefor each target actually expended (i.e. F/A-22 OFP, PE12345). Missiles and targets should be groupedby program. A4.1.4.  AERIAL TARGET/MISSILE TYPES. List types and models of targets and missilesexpended (i.e. MQM-107E/AIM-9M, QF-4/AIM-120C5, etc…). A4.1.5.  FISCAL YEAR (FY). Enter the FY the report covers. A4.1.6.  QUANTITY EXPENDED THIS FY. Enter the cumulative number of targets, by type,expended during the FY. A4.1.7.  ALLOCATION FOR FY. Enter the total number of targets allocated for this FY. A4.1.8.  ALLOCATION EXPENDED. Mathematically divide the category “EXPENDED FORFY” by the category “ALLOCATED FOR FY.” A4.1.9.  FIRINGS PER LAUNCH. Enter the number of missile firings per target per launch. Math-ematically divide the total number of missiles fired at that type of target by the total number oflaunches of that type of target. A4.1.10.  FIRINGS PER LOSS. Enter the number of missiles fired at a particular type target beforeit was lost or destroyed. AFI99-108   1 MARCH 200719Attachment 5  KILL / PRESENTATION AUTHORIZATION CALCULATIONS  20 AFI99-108   1 MARCH 2007AFI99-108   1 MARCH 2007 21
