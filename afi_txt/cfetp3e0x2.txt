The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet the training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The following decisions were made by a career field Specialty Training Requirements Team (STRT) held at Sheppard AFB, TX on 4 to 8 of March 2013.  B3.1.  Initials Skills Training.  The initial skill course was reviewed for content.  Additions, deletions, and  modifications were  made to the course.  Wartime training tasks were  identified and validated.  B3.2.    Five  Level  Upgrade  Training  Requirements.    Existing  CDCs  were  reviewed  and updated to ensure only current material remained and new technology information was added.  B3.3.  Seven Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  Seven-level training requirements were reviewed and validated.  B3.4.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements that were not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are assigned as continuation training.  Purpose of continuation training  is to provide training exceeding  minimum upgrade training requirements with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  MAJCOMs must develop a continuation-training program that ensures personnel in the Electrical Power Production career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their careers.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements. 15 PART I CFETP 3E0X2, 1 OCT 2015 B3.5.  Supplemental Training.

This section is reserved.”   32 CFETP 3E0X2, 1 OCT 2015 PART II  SECTION A - SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD  A1.    Implementation.    This  STS  will  be  used  for  technical  training  provided  by  AETC Electrical Power Production Apprentice course with class beginning 1 OCT 2015 and graduating on or after 17 DEC 2015.   A2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, and in collaboration with the Civil Engineer, Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), it is mandatory for all civil engineers, regardless of duty assignment, to use an automated training record.  The automated training record currently being utilized to document upgrade and qualification training is the Air Force Training Record (AFTR) and the application is located on the CE-VLC.  A2.1.  Column 1 (Tasks, Knowledge, and Technical References). Lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and supporting technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  A2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks).  Identifies core tasks (specialty-wide training requirements) by an  asterisk  (*)  in  the  appropriate  skill  level  sub-column.    As  a  minimum,  trainees  must complete  hands-on  certification  on  all  core,  critical  and  diamond  tasks  for  skill  level upgrade.  A2.2.1.  Wartime Tasks.  All tasks in the 3-level course column are considered wartime tasks.  In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.  A2.2.2.  Diamond Tasks.  Tasks identified  by a diamond (♦) are considered contingency/war task  and  are  critical  to  the  career  field.    Equipment  shortfalls  at  most  locations  have  created problems  with  actual  hands-on  certification  of  these  tasks.    In  instances  where  required equipment is not available  for instruction, completion of the corresponding task AFQTP is all that is required for upgrade/qualification training.  A2.3.  Column 3 (Certification for OJT).  Used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training  requirements.    Use  the  automated  training  record  application  to  document  individual qualifications.    Task  certification  of  core,  critical  and  diamond  tasks  require  a  training completion  date  and  initials  of  the  trainee,  trainer,  and  certifier.    All  non-core  tasks  require training completion date and initials of the trainee and trainer only.  A2.4.    Column  4  (Proficiency  Codes  Used  to  Indicate  Training/Information  Provided).  Indicates formal training and correspondence course requirements.  It shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task, knowledge and the career knowledge provided by formal courses, CDC, distance learning (DL) web-based training (WBT)  and  AFQTPs.    See  CADRE/AFSC/CDC  listing  maintained  by  the  unit  education  and training manager for current CDC listings.  A2.5.  Qualitative Requirements.  Contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by WBT, resident training and career development courses. 33 PART II  CFETP 3E0X2, 1 OCT 2015  A2.6.  Job Qualification Standard (JQS).  The STS becomes the JQS for OJT when placed in automated  training  application  and  used  according  to  AFI  36-2201.    For  OJT,  the  tasks  in Column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of  procedures.    AFQTPs,  when  available,  shall  be  used  to  identify  Air  Force  standardized procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  A2.6.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training.  A2.6.1.1.  Duty position.  Duty position requirements will be developed and identified by the workcenter supervisor and loaded into the automated training application.  Completion of core, critical and diamond tasks are mandatory for all duty positions.  Ensure the correct duty position title is listed under Profile 1 section of the trainee’s automated training record.    A2.6.1.2.  AFQTP Training and Documentation.  AFQTP or AFQTP assessments have been created  for  all  core  (*)  and  diamond  (♦)  tasks.    Completion  is  mandatory  to  fulfill  task knowledge requirements for upgrade/qualification training.  Each AFQTP provides step-by-step procedures  for the  trainee,  trainer,  and  certifier  in  completing  each  core  or  diamond  task  and instructions how to document the training in the automated training record.  A2.6.1.2.1.  Training.  Documentation of the start and completion of the AFQTP in the QTP section located in the automated training record is required for all core and diamond tasks.  The automated training record will not allow you to sign off any tasks in the JQS until the completion date has been entered.  Diamond tasks require the completion of the web-based course (with the review and post-test located in the program) or completion of the AFQTP assessment located on the  CE-VLC  to  determine  if  the  trainee  has  attained  the  knowledge  level  required.    Once  the trainee  has  completed  the  web-based  course  or  AFQTP  assessment,  the  course  completion certificate must be provided to the trainer/supervisor for documentation of the completion in the automated training record and completion of hands-on training, if the equipment is available.  A2.6.1.2.2.  Hands-On Training.  DO NOT sign off the tasks in the JQS until the trainee has completed hands-on/certification training.  For diamond tasks, if the equipment is not available at home station, the completion of the AFQTP or AFQTP assessment is the ONLY requirement for upgrade.  When the equipment becomes available either at home station or at a TDY location, the trainee can be signed off within the JQS section of the automated training record.  A2.6.2.    Transcribing  from  previous  versions  to  the  new  CFETP.    Most  items  should transcribe automatically during the update of the new CFETP.  The UTM and supervisor must conduct a review of the new STS to identify any new core, diamond, or non-core tasks and add those tasks to their duty positions.  A2.6.2.1.    Previous  training  certification  not  listed    If  previous  training  certification  is  not listed  in  the  individual  record,  select  the  parent  task  to  be  transcribed,  check  the  task  title(s) block, and click on the transcribe button.  Enter the date of the original certification and sign off the  task(s).   The  trainee  will  then  sign  off  the  task(s)  to  finalize  the  transcription  of  previous 34 PART II  CFETP 3E0X2, 1 OCT 2015 training certification.  The automated application will place an entry into the trainee 623a and must be acknowledged by the transcriber and trainee.  A2.6.2.2.  Transcribing external training certification.  If a trainee attended a formal training course and received appropriate accreditation, select the 623 III section of the user’s automated training record and locate the course title in the master task list, then enter the completion date.  If the course title is not listed, contact the UTM to have it loaded from the master catalog.  If it is not listed in the master catalog contact the Force Development Manager at AFCEC to have it loaded in the master catalog.  A2.6.3.    Documenting  Career  Knowledge.    When  a  CDC  is  not  available,  the  supervisor identifies STS training references that the trainee requires for career knowledge IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program and ensures, as a minimum, that trainees cover all mandatory items specified in AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted).  For two-time CDC exam failures, the unit commander will take appropriate action IAW AFI 36-2201. Note: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver.  A2.6.4.  Decertification.  When an Airman is found to be unqualified on a task, the supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title.  The supervisor shall select the Decertify button on the screen menu and enter a 623a comment explaining why the task  was  decertified,  and  then  enter  the  Airman  into  qualification  training.    The  individual  is recertified using the normal certification process.  A2.6.5.  Recertification.  When an Airman is required to be recertified on a previous task due to annual or bi-annual requirements.  The supervisor shall identify the task in the JQS and check the box next to the task title and select the Recertify button on the screen and entry the dates the recertification was completed.    A2.6.6.  Training Standard.  Tasks are trained and certified to the “go” level. Go means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets the local requirements for accuracy, timeliness,  and  correct  use  of  procedures.  This  equates  to  a  3c  in  the  proficiency  code  key. AFQTPs, when available, shall be used to identify Air Force standardized procedures.  A2.7.  Specialty Training Standard.  The STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used  in  the  Weighted  Airman  Promotion  System  (WAPS).    Specialty  Knowledge  Tests  are developed at the USAF Airman Advancement Division by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by  test  development  team  members  as  most  appropriate  for  promotion  to  higher  grades.  Questions  are  based  upon  study  references  listed  in  the  Enlisted  Promotions  References  and Requirements  Catalog.    Individual  responsibilities  are  in  AFI  36-2605,  AF  Military  Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces.  A3.  Recommendations.

This area is reserved.”   41 CFETP 3E0X2, 1 OCT 2015 PART II  SECTION F - HOME STATION TRAINING  F1.    Purpose.    The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  identify  the  tasks,  training  references,  and training sources available in support of contingency/wartime training.  Civil Engineer forces will train to meet the full range of tasks expected in the contingency environment.  Training ranges from  knowledge-type  training  conducted  in  a  classroom,  to  task-oriented  hands-on  training conducted in the field.  These training requirements, frequencies, and sources are listed in AFI 10-209, RED HORSE Program and AFI 10-210, Prime Base Emergency Engineer Force (BEEF) Program.  F2.  Home Station Training (HST).   HST  is knowledge-based and  hands-on training that  is conducted  at  the  individual’s  home  station  for  contingency  operations.    The  CE  Commander ensures training is provided and documented and arranges for subject matter experts to conduct training as required. AFI 10-209, Attachments 2-6 and AFI 10-210, Attachments 2-6, identifies the personnel to be trained by specialty and frequencies.    F3.  Combat Skills Training (CST).  CST must be institutionalized as an integral part of any HST program.  Lessons learned from operations, such as IRAQI FREEDOM, have taught us the importance of maintaining a higher level of combat readiness.  Although the inclusion of combat skills-focused training  into HST does not fully prepare CE personnel to work in a  high threat combat environment, the steps taken to enhance training will  help elevate units to a readiness level  capable  of  supporting  safe  and  effective  operations  in  low  to  medium  risk  combat environments.  F4.  Mission Essential Equipment Training (MEET).  Wartime or contingency environments often involve the use of specialized and unique mission-essential equipment that civil engineers do  not  use  in  their  day-to-day  operations.    Due  to the  cost  and  complexity,  mission  essential contingency equipment and trainer expertise are not commonly found at CONUS installations.  Personnel must be hands-on certified and the certification documented in their CFETP.  AFI 10-210, Attachment 4, identifies minimum number of personnel to be trained, positions by specialty, frequencies and Chapter 2 identifies the locations of training sites.  Inadequate training on these key equipment items can negatively impact Air Force contingency operations.  F5.  AF  Expeditionary  (ES)  Training  Requirement.    AETC,  as  lead  MAJCOM  for  AF  ES training, revamped ancillary home-station and advanced (mission specific) expeditionary skills training plans to standardize and synchronize training across the force.  Detailed requirements for AF ES training is available in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program, Chapter 8.   F6. Training References.  F6.1.  AFI  10-209,  RED  HORSE  Program,  Chapter  3  and  Attachments  2-6  identify  the  RED HORSE recurring training requirements.   F6.2.

AFQTP Documentation Record.   A3.1.    To  ensure  each  Electrical  Power  Production  specialist  trainee  is  trained  to  the  correct standard an AF Qualification Training Package (AFQTP) () has been developed for each core and  diamond  tasks  identified  in  their  STS.   These  AFQTPs  are  mandated to  be  used  by  the trainee, trainer, and certifier in their on-the-job-training program for upgrade to the 5- or 7-level.  A3.2.  These  AFQTPs  ensures  all  aspects  of  the  task  is  covered  sufficiently  and  provide additional task knowledge in preparation for hands-on training.  AFQTPs summarize procedures on a task performance checklist for use by trainers, certifiers, and trainees.    A3.2.1.  The UTM or supervisor can download paper-based AFQTP's.  Paper-based AFQTP’s can be found on the CE-VLC under the Library link and then by selecting Resources.  A3.2.2.  In additional to the paper-based AFQTPs there are web-based courses or assessments developed  for  certain  tasks  that  are  available  on  the  CE-VLC  under  the  Course  List  link  and specialty topic area.    A3.3.  Documentation.  Before a core or diamond task can be signed off in the JQS section of the individual automated training record the task must be signed off in the QTP section first.   A3.3.1.  Core/Diamond Tasks.  To document the completion the supervisor or trainer opens the individual automated training record, navigates to the QTP section, enter the start and completed date with signatures.    A3.3.2.  Diamond (♦) Tasks.  Supervisors/Trainers DO NOT sign off the corresponding JQS task until the trainee has completed hands-on training.  If the required equipment is not available at your location, completion of the task’s AFQTP web-based course or assessment with a passing score  of  80%  is  all  that  required  for  upgrade  training.    Hands-on  certification  shall  be accomplished at the first opportunity when equipment is available and then can be signed off on the JQS.
