This Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive education and training document that identifies life-cycle education/training requirements, training support resources and minimum core task requirements for this specialty.  The CFETP will provide personnel a clear career path to success and instill rigor in all aspects of career field training. 2.  The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts.  Management uses both parts in conjunction with Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage and control training within the career field.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 2.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training and other); Section D indicates resource constraints (e.g., funds, manpower, equipment, facilities); and Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 2.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Training References (TRs) to support training, AETC-conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements.  Section C identifies available support materials (e.g., Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to support proficiency training).  Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 3.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers.  This plan enables the Air Force to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs.  4     Abbreviations/Terms Explained This section provides a common understanding of the terms that apply to the Cyber Warfare Operations CFETP. Advanced Training (AT).  A formal course of training that leads to a technical or supervisory level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  Training is for selected Airmen at the advanced level of an AFS. Air and Space Expeditionary Force (AEF).  The AEF is the Air Force’s methodology for organizing, training, equipping, and sustaining rapidly responsive air and space forces to meet defense strategy requirements.  Through the AEF, consisting of enabler and tempo banded capabilities the Air Force supports defense strategy requirements using a combination of both permanently assigned and rotational (allocated) forces.

This CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, trainers and certifiers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training that individuals in AFSC 1B4X1 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is provided by the 333th Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training program.  Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends training throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of the training, and provides the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Use of the CFETP.  The CFETP is maintained by the 1BXXX Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), SAF/CIO A6SF.  MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they determine whether duplicate training exists and take steps to eliminate/prevent duplicate efforts.  Career field training managers at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the career ladder. 2.1.  AETC training personnel develop/revise formal resident and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in the STS.  They also develop procurement and acquisition strategies for obtaining resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MAJCOM FMs ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial skill and upgrade requirements.  They also identify the needed AFJQSs/AFQTPs to document unique upgrade and continuation training requirements.  Requirements are satisfied through OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courseware/courses.  MAJCOM developed training to support this AFSC must be included into this plan. 2.3.  81 TRSS/TSQ Qualification Training Flight (Q-Flight) personnel develop training packages (AFJQSs/AFQTPs) based on requests submitted by the MAJCOMs and according to the priorities assigned by the AFCFM.  11     2.4.  Unit training managers and supervisors manage and control progression through the career field by ensuring individuals complete the mandatory training requirements for upgrade specified in this plan and supplemented by their MAJCOM.  The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference for planning continuation or career enhancement training. 2.5.  Submit recommended CFETP corrections to the 81 TRSS Q-Flight Customer Service Desk at 81 TRSS/TSQS, 601 D Street, Keesler AFB MS 39534-2235 or call DSN 597-3343. To contact electronically send email to: qflight.customer.service@us.af.mil. 2.6.  Submit recommended CFETP additions/deletions through your MAJCOM Functional Manager. 3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements.  The AETC training manager initiates an annual review of this document by AETC and MAJCOM functional managers to ensure the CFETP’s currency and accuracy by using the list of courses in Part II to eliminate duplicate training.   12     Section B - Career Field Progression and Information 4.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a progress check. 5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task. Section C - Support Materials 7.  There are currently no support materials.  This area is reserved.
