Security Forces (SF) Mission.  SF protect, defend and fight to enable Air Force, Joint and Coalition missions. 1.2.  Security Forces Vision.  Mission-ready, resilient and air-minded SF organized, trained and equipped to deliver enduring Integrated Defense (ID) against threats to the Air Force, Joint and Coalition missions; recognized and respected for our air-centric expertise. 1.3.  Defender  Mind-Set.  The  SF  Core  Competencies  of  Security  Operations,  Law  &  Order Operations,  Security  Support  Operations  and  Mission  Assurance  form  the  foundation  upon which  we  organize,  train  and  equip  and  are  the  cornerstone  of  our  strength  as  an  organization. The Defender approaches his or her Defense and Security task with a unique mind-set, focused on  protection  of  the  Air  Force's  fighting  power.  The  Defender  Mind-Set  is  captured  in  three attributes: 1.3.1.  Air-minded  Defenders.    The  ultimate  source  of  SF  combat  capability  resides  in  the men  and  women  that  make  up  the  career  field.    These  Defenders,  which  consist  of  active, Guard, Reserve, and civilian personnel are our largest investment and most critical asset.  SF Protect  and  Defend  with  an  air-minded  approach  developed  through  doctrine,  training,  and experience.  We understand how the Air Force executes its unique air, space and cyberspace missions and how the air base is the critical node in delivering Air Force capabilities to the Joint  Force  Commander;  we  understand  how  an  air  base  operates  and  how  its  personnel conduct  their  tasks.    With  this  in  mind,  SF  integrates  defense  concepts  into  the  overall operation of the air base.  From the moment Airmen start SF training and become Defenders, we are dedicated to ensuring they receive the air-minded education, training, and professional development necessary to protect, defend and enable Air Force missions. 1.3.2.  A  warrior  ethos  with  a  technological  aptitude.    Due  to  the  nature  of  our  demanding missions,  the  SF  enterprise  nurtures  and  sustains  a  warrior  ethos  to  produce  well  trained, dedicated  and  resilient  Defenders.    In  conjunction  with  these  warrior  skills,  SF  employs  a variety  of  technologies  to  enhance  our  capabilities.    To  translate  this  technology  into operational capability, our Defenders have the cognition and ability to apply technology and systems effectively to provide a force multiplying effect. 1.3.3.  Adaptive,  innovative  delivery  of  ID  effects.    The  demands  of  delivering  ID  require Defenders  who  can  adapt  to  any  operations  environment  and  geographical  location.    They must  be  creative  and  adjust  their  air-minded  expertise  and  technology  to  any  situation  to include Joint Expeditionary Tasking (JET) missions, which could require skills outside those normally performed.  Defenders understand that each mission must be protected according to the responsible commander’s intent, as well as the threats, vulnerabilities, and asset criticality that drive  ID planning.  Finally, Defenders must continuously adapt  to  changing conditions that affect the defensive plan for the air base or operating location. 6 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 2 SECURITY FORCES TRAINING PROGRAM 2.1.  Objective.  The objective of the SF Training Program is to build aggressive, lethal, highly-maneuverable,  air-minded,  capabilities-based  and  combat-focused  Defenders.   Trained Defenders  will  possess  enhanced  individual  and  collective  skills  that  ensure  delivery  of  ID desired effects and mission success. 2.2.  Description.  The  SF  Training  Program  includes  program  areas,  which  are  described  in detail in subsequent chapters of this instruction.  Deliberate execution of all required areas, along the appropriate timelines, are needed to build, reinforce and sustain the individual and collective skills necessary to provide enduring ID against threats to Air Force, Joint and Coalition missions.  While all training must be documented appropriately, SF training programs must be rooted in the evaluate-train-evaluate concept  and should utilize a variety  of venues for accomplishment  (e.g. lecture, hands-on performance/OJT, exercises/battle drills).  This ensures members are proficient in the identified task, by first evaluating, identifying weak areas, and in turn, training those areas to a level of proficiency.  Under this concept, an individual or team does not require additional training  if  they  have  demonstrated  proficiency  in  a  given  task.    The  SF  Training  Program consists of the following: 2.2.1.  Formal Training. 2.2.2.  Home Station Training (HST). 2.2.3.  Expeditionary Combat Certification Readiness Training (ECCeRT). 2.2.4.  Combat Readiness Training (CRT). 2.2.5.  AF  Expeditionary  Readiness  Program  (ERP)  Training  includes  Basic  Airman Readiness  (BAR),  Basic  Deployment  Readiness  (BDR)  and  Advanced  Deployment Readiness (ADR) training. 2.3.  Responsibilities.  SF  at  every  level  have  an  inherent  responsibility  to  ensure  personnel under  their  command  or  supervision  are  adequately  trained  and  maintain  proficiency  in  their mission  essential  tasks  (MET).    SF  tasked  with  training  other  Defenders  assumes  the  role  as teacher  and  small  unit  leaders,  responsible  for  every  aspect  of  an  Airman’s  development,  to include the delivery of recurring training.  Leader-led training is the primary delivery method for all  SF  standardized  recurring  training.    Individuals  conducting  leader-led  training  are  not required  to  attend  Principles  of  Instruction,  the  Air  University  (AU)  Online  Instructor Methodology Course 1.2 (Course Number 03S00W), or an AFSFC-approved  Instructor Course unless  required  by  the  SF  Unit  CC.    However,  SF  conducting  leader-led  training  must  have attended  the  Air  Force  Training  Course.    In  addition,  SF  must  comply  with  training responsibilities  outlined  in  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program.    ADR  level  courses  of instruction  may  be  taught  by  leader-led  instructors  at  home  station,  but  will  be  validated  by personnel at a RTC who have completed instructor methodology as outlined in this instruction, which  includes  certification  through  Principles  of  Instruction,  the  Air  University  (AU)  Online Instructor Methodology Course 1.2 (Course Number 03S00), or an AFSFC approved Instructor Course.

Ensures AFSFC is  advised  if unit cannot fill. 3.2.2.3.  Ensures  all  unit  members  complete  formal  training  to  meet  both  home  station and deployment task proficiency requirements. 3.2.3.  S-3/Training. 3.2.3.1.  Identifies annual unit MRTP requirements; forwards to SF Unit CC for approval before forwarding to AFSFC. 3.2.3.2.  Responds  to  AFSFC,  AFIMSC  and  MAJCOM  training  data  calls.    All information  collected  from  these  data  calls  should  be  shared  between  the  AFSFC, AFIMSC and MAJCOM to alleviate the unit from accomplishing multiple data calls. 3.2.3.3.  Utilizes ETCA website to maintain awareness of available training for the career field. 3.2.3.4.  Ensures  SF  attending  formal  training  courses  meet  eligibility  requirements  as outlined in the ETCA website. 3.2.3.5.  Monitors  current  FY  training  allocations  for  the  unit,  executes  quotas,  seeks funding  for  quotas  and  utilizes  the  out-of-cycle  program  for  unexpected  training requirements. 3.2.3.6.  Works  with  the  UTM  to  ensure  personnel  complete  all  skill-level  upgrade requirements.  Provide monthly Status of Training (SOT) reports to the commander and documents the meeting on an official memorandum with the SF Unit CC signature. 3.3.  Formal Training Process. 3.3.1.  AFIMSC  Dets  and  MAJCOMs  are  allocated  SF  specific  quotas  for  the  FY  from AETC through the MRTP validation and allocation process. 3.3.2.  Mission Readiness Training Requirements. 3.3.2.1.  AFSFC  conducts  an  annual  data  call  of  all  units  through  the  AFIMSC  or MAJCOM  POC  to  project  the  next  FY  training  requirements.  Do  not  over  program  or overestimate requirements; program for the actual mission sustainment requirements. 3.3.2.2.  Annually,  AFPC  initiates  an  MRTP  validation  data  call  through  the  AFIMSC. The  data  call  consists  of  a  3-year  outlook  at  training  needs.    AFSFC  revalidates  FY requirements  previously  projected  for  the  next  two  FYs  as  well  as  project  requirements for the third year. 3.3.2.3.  HQ  AFIMSC  or  MFMs  validates  and  consolidates  PCE/AAD  requirements  for their units and submit to the A1 TRQI Manager for entering into the Military Personnel Data System/Oracle Training Administration (MilPDS/OTA). 14 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 3.3.2.4.  AFPC  TRQI  Managers  compile  data  for  all  HQ  AFIMSC  or  MFMs,  validate within their baseline and build the requirements into MilPDS/OTA. 3.3.2.5.  AFIMSC/A1  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  any  issues  regarding  quota funding. 3.3.3.  Mission Readiness Training Allocations. 3.3.3.1.  Once all allocations are loaded in OTA, the HQ AFIMSC or MFMs exports the data.  AFIMSC determines how to allocate quotas to units based upon MRT data call and quotas received. 3.3.3.2.  The  MRTP  funded  baseline  set  by  Second  Air  Force  (2  AF)  determines  the number of funded quotas available. 3.3.3.3.  SF Unit  CCs who have not  executed  funded quotas in  the past  (e.g., 20 quotas requested and only 10 executed), could affect future quotas received. 3.3.3.4.  Zeroing  of  requirements  may  occur  if  allocations  from  previous  FYs  were  not filled; 30 days prior for Air Force courses or 60 days prior for sister service courses. 3.3.4.  Priority Explanation. 3.3.4.1.  When  submitting  MRTP  validations,  units  must  designate  a  priority  for  each requirement. (T-2) 3.3.4.2.  Priority  1  are  Mission  Critical  requirements:  the  mission  will  fail  without  this training.  Units submit all “T” quota type requests under Priority 1; any under priority 2 will be zeroed out.  “P” quota types may also be loaded under Priority 1 if unit, AFIMSC, or MAJCOM is funding the course. 3.3.4.3.  Priority  2  are  Mission  Essential  requirements:  the  mission  will not  fail,  but  the training would greatly assist in accomplishing the mission.  All Priority 2 quotas should be submitted as a “P” quota type. 3.3.4.4.  Distance learning and Mobile Training Team classes type 4, 6 or 7 (look at the second digit in  the course number [e.g., J7AZTTXXXX 0P1A]), do not  count  against a MAJCOM’s funded baseline.  “T” quotas cannot be built under these classes. 3.3.5.  Allocations in Non-SF Functional Courses. 3.3.5.1.  All  formal  courses  are  managed  by  a  course  owner.    Other  AFSCs  requiring training in SF allocated training seek these courses via the AFSFC. Similarly, AFIMSC MFM  Cell  also  seeks  training  venues  through  other  MAJCOM/AFIMSC  Course Functional Managers. 3.3.5.2.  Based upon results of the training data call, contact Course Functional Managers for  the  required  courses  to  request  allocations.    Most  of  these  courses  can  be  identified using AFPC SharePoint website. 3.3.6.  Non-Mission Readiness Training Allocations. 3.3.6.1.  In addition to the standard SF formal training courses, there are numerous other training venues available, which enhance overall unit capabilities and skill sets.  Most of these courses can be identified using the ETCA website to search for courses. AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 15 3.3.6.2.  AFSFC schedule Non-MRT courses either directly through the course owner, or by  having  requirements  built  and  requesting  allocations  in  a  course  from  the  course owner.  When requesting allocations in a Non-MRT course that is not directly scheduled by  the  course  owner,  submit  the  course  and  quota  information  to  the  MAJCOM/A1  to request requirements be built in OTA.  Once requirements are built, the course owner can release allocations to the TRQI and courses can be scheduled through AFPC as outlined below. 3.4.  Scheduling. 3.4.1.  Formal  training classes for upgrade training, cross training and Professional  Military Education are processed  through the base level  formal  training offices.  The majority of all other formal training is requested by S-3/Training through the AFSFC. 3.4.2.  Units  will  submit  formal  training  requests  for  FY  allocations  to  the  AFSFC.  (T-2)  ANG  units  will  submit  FY  allocations  to  NGB.  (T-2)  AFRC  units  will  submit  requests through AF AFRC. (T-2) 3.4.3.  When  additional  allocations  are  needed,  the  unit  may  seek  quotas  using  the  “out  of cycle” process.   Formal training classes have a “use or lose” date, usually within 30 days of the  class  start  date  for  Air  Force  courses  and  60  days  for  sister  service  courses.    Units  not filling allocations prior to “use or lose” date risk losing training allocations. 3.4.4.  Units may request a quota movement to change quota status. 3.4.4.1.  Change  a  quota  status  from  officer,  enlisted  or  civilian  by  submitting  a  quota movement request.  For example, request an “AP” quota be changed to an “OP” quota.  If approved, the quota changes from an enlisted “A” quota to officer “O” quota. 3.4.4.2.  Request funding for a course by submitting an out-of-cycle request for funding.  For  example,  request  an  “AP”  quota  be  changed  to  an  “AT”  quota.    If  approved,  the quota changes from a Unit/MAJCOM funded “P” quota to a fully funded “T” quota. 3.4.4.3.  Funding availability is determined by 2 AF/MRTP. 3.4.5.  Prior  to  submitting  training  requests,  units  must  ensure  members  meet  eligibility requirements as outlined in the ETCA website. (T-2) 3.4.5.1.  Students  not  meeting  course  prerequisites  are  not  submitted  for  training  unless the ETCA website prerequisite waiver process is followed (if one is listed), or the AFSFC works directly with the formal training course Point of Contact to approve the eligibility discrepancy. 3.4.5.2.  Units  submit  grade  waivers  to  the  AFSFC  for  validation.    The  waivers  will  be endorsed  by  the  SF  Unit  CC  and  MAJCOM/A4S.  (T-2)    If  there  are  available  slots  the AFSFC will forward the request to the appropriate CFM for final approval. (T-2) 3.4.5.3.  Members  reporting  to  school  without  a  valid  Training  Line  Number  (TLN)  or without meeting prerequisites may be returned to home-station without attending training and the parent organization incurs any/all associated costs. 3.4.6.  AFSFC afpc.dpsit.mrt@us.af.mil. submits training requests to the  AFPC/DPSIT  MRT at 16 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 3.4.7.  Once processed, the AFSFC provides units the TLN for each student. 3.4.8.  A formal training report on individual personnel is generated by the servicing Military Personnel  Section.  UTM/UDMs  or  supervisors  provide  students  reporting  instructions,  as outlined in the ETCA website, prior to departing for TDY. (T-3) 3.5.  Course Replacements/Cancellations/Swaps 3.5.1.  The  unit  will  submit  replacements,  cancellations  or  swaps  to  the  AFIMSC  for processing using current AFPC format and template. (T-3) 3.5.2.  Failure to submit replacements, cancellations or swaps in a timely manner may result in  loss  of  training  quotas.    Units  effectively  monitor  and  execute  training  quotas  to  ensure minimal loss of training.  Unfilled training quotas ultimately affect the entire SF community by denying other personnel or students training opportunities. 3.5.3.  Students  not  attending  scheduled  training  are  marked  as  a  no-show.    Parent organizations  incur  any/all  associated  costs  for  student  no-shows.    UTM  will  provide justification for no-show to the AFSFC before the student can be rescheduled. (T-2) 3.6.  Formal Training Resources. 3.6.1.  The  SF  SMARTNet  website  provides  SF  members  a  portal  for  access  to  various training programs, resources and tools.  Additionally, the SF Center of Training Excellence website  (SF  CTE)  https://sf-cte.adls.af.mil/kc/main/kc_frame.asp?blnWhatsNew=True provides  members  access  to  SF  specific  courses,  resource  materials  and  a  direct  link  into their AFTR records by clicking the AFTR link in the top right corner. 3.6.2.  Air Force Officer Classification Directory/Air Force Enlisted Classification Directory.  These  separate  directories  contain  the  official  specialty  descriptions  for  all  military classification  codes  and  identifies  each  Air  Force  job  and  the  minimum  mandatory qualifications  of  personnel  to  fill  these  jobs.    These  standards  are  used  to  develop  career programs  for  initial  skills  training,  skill  level  upgrade  training  and  supplemental  training. Special Experience Identifiers (SEI) are also located in these directories and can be found on the AFPC website at https://gum-crm.csd.disa.mil/app/answers/detail/a_id/7504 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 17 Chapter 4 SECURITY FORCES HOME STATION TRAINING PROGRAM 4.1.  SF Home Station Training (HST) Program. 4.1.1.  HST prepares SF personnel to perform in their current duty position, to include duty position  tasks,  core  tasks,  contingency  tasks,  and  additional  duty  tasks.    SF  accomplishes HST  through  individual  and  collective  skills  training.    This  applies  to  all  units  performing standard LE, Security & Custody missions.  Units performing training and unique missions separate  from  the  standard  SF  role,  (i.e.  341st,  342d,  RTCs)  train  IAW  their  unit’s  annual training plan.  A consolidated table of required HST and their associated training frequency is  located  on  the  AFSFC  SMARTNet  website.    In  addition,  this  table  identifies  additional training prescribed by DoDI 5525.15, Law Enforcement Standards and Training in the DoD, the  SF  Unit  CC  must  ensure  individuals  conducting  law  enforcement  duties  unsupervised receive the prescribed training. (T-0) 4.1.2.  Home  Station  Training  (HST)  Objective.  The  HST  objective  is  non-post  associated training  designed  to  provide  a  career  field  training  strategy.    The  initiative  allows MAJCOMs,    AFIMSC,  AFSFC  and  units  the  ability  to  size  training  to  meet  local  mission requirements associated with Mission Essential Tasks (METs), Mission Essential Task Lists (METL) and UTC obligations.  HST links directly to the unit’s AF-IT (Air Force Input Tool) reporting  and  the  Defense  Readiness  Reporting  System  (DRRS).    In  addition,  HST establishes  a  standard  baseline  of  training  which,  ensures  the  Headquarters  Air  Force Director of Security Forces vision of a global delivery of a standardized, tactically proficient and resilient defender, regardless of MAJCOM, mission, or location. 4.1.2.1.  HST Program Methodology. 4.1.2.1.1.  Unit Training Obligation.  Active Duty, Department of Air Force Civilian Police/Security  Guards  (DAF  CP/SG)  0083/0085,  and  full  time  Air  Reserve Component (ARC) personnel will complete 216 hours of HST annually.  (T-1)  HAF directs  109  hours  of  training  through  the  Foundational  Skills  Library  (FSL).  MAJCOMs or unit SF Unit CC determine the remaining 107 hours from the SF HST Course Catalog.  IMAs and non-full time Category A (unit) AFRC will complete 151 hours of HST in a 48 month cycle directly linked to the AEF cycle. (T-1)  This cycle will encompass 39 months to accomplish HST, three months to accomplish ECCeRT, CRT, ERP, and a six month deployment vulnerability window. (T-1)  IMAs and non-full time Category A (unit) ARC on extended orders “120 days or more” will assume the  Active  Duty  HST  requirements  listed  above.  (T-1)    NOTE:  Training  times identified are for force management and planning purposes only.  Security Forces are required  to  be  trained  to  standard  not  to  a  specific  time.    ANG  will  follow  HST timelines defined by NGB/A4S. (T-1)  Units requesting specific training not outlined in the AF HST Course Catalog required approval from the AFSFC. 4.1.2.1.2.  Individual Training Obligation.  Although it is desirable for all individuals to  be  trained  to  the  same  tactical  level,  unless  otherwise  identified  by  higher  level guidance,  HST  applies  only  to:  E-6s/O-2s  and  below  and  equivalent  DAF/CP (according to position description and IAW AFI 31-122, Department of the Air Force 18 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 Civilian  Police/Security  Guard  Program  assigned  to  flight  or  filling  a  unit  support position within a SF Squadron.  All others must be knowledgeable of the operational employment  of  these  forces  commensurate  with  duty  position.  (T-1)  NOTE:  Units should  avoid  overtime  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  and  adhere  to  local  civilian overtime policies. 4.1.2.1.3.  Credit  for  ECCeRT  and  ADR.    An  individual’s  completion  of  ECCeRT and  ADR  Training  will  be  credited  towards  the  107  hours  of  MAJCOM or  SF  Unit CC  training  through  the  SF  Expeditionary  Skill  Library  (ESL).  (T-1)  These individuals  are  still  required  to  complete  the  FSL  (HAF  mandated  109  hours).  Additionally,  those  individuals  would  have  had  to  complete  CRT  within  180  days prior to vulnerability window. 4.1.2.1.4.  Personnel Returning from  Deployments.  Unless otherwise determined by the MAJCOM, individuals returning from deployments will fall into the unit’s annual training cycle upon return to duty status.5 (T-2) These individuals are not required to execute the portions of the annual training plan already completed while they were in deployed or reconstitution status. 4.1.2.1.5.  Unit Orientation Training.  Unless otherwise determined by the MAJCOM, there  are  no  specified  AF/A4S  orientation  training  requirements  (Nuclear  units  will have  to  evaluate  for  possible  additional  orientation  requirements).  (T-2)    Instead, units  will  utilize  orientation  training  to  bring  newly  assigned  personnel  in  line  with the  unit’s  annual  training  cycle  and  to  execute  necessary  Unit  Training  Manager (UTM)  and  local  administrative  processes.  (T-3)  During  orientation  training, personnel  will  be  evaluated  on  training  which  they  received  a  GO  at  their  previous duty station and which occurred during the gaining unit’s current training cycle. (T-3) If properly documented and the member still meets the established training standards then they will not be required to re-accomplish the previously conducted training and no  further  documentation  is  required.  (T-3)    The  SF  Unit  CC  will  determine  in writing if tech school  graduates are required to complete training to fall in line with the unit’s annual training plan cycle. (T-3) 4.1.2.1.6.  Mission Needs Analysis (MNA).  A MNA must be conducted to determine the SF Unit CC’s mission responsibilities and establish the foundation for the unit’s annual  training  plan.  (T-2)  Elements  needed  to  complete  the  MNA  are:  Designed Operational Capability (DOC) Statement, METs obligations (SF Unit CC determined with  AFIMSC  approval),  projected  UTC  obligations  (DW  Coded  Positions),  Post Priority Chart and special certifications and qualifications. (T-2) 4.1.2.1.7.  Annual  Training  Plan  (ATP).    Requirements  identified  by  the  MNA coupled  with  the  MAJCOM,  AFIMSC  or  SF  Unit  CC  desired  advanced  skills  or proficiencies  will  be  aligned  against  the  unit’s  training  obligations  and  SF  HST Course Catalog to  build the unit’s ATP. (T-2) For unit level  planning purposes, if a topic  reference  is  added  after  the  SF  Unit  CC  signs  the  ATP  then  the  unit  is  not required  to  update  the  ATP  until  the  following  scheduled  publication  date  (not  to exceed 12 months) and will remain exempt during this duration of time. (T-1) 4.1.2.1.8.  Aligning  Forces  against  the  ATP.    Each  work  center  (S-1,  S-2,  S-3,  S-4, and  S-5)  will  further  breakdown  the  ATP  to  align  members  with  required  training, AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 19 certifications and qualifications not applicable to all and to develop their work center Master  Task  List  (MTL).  (T-3)  Once  complete,  use  the  information  from  the  MNA and the ATP to build the MTP, selecting topics from the SF HST course catalog only. Training  topics  identified  by  MNA  and  ATPs,  which  aren’t  outlined  in  the  HST catalog, must be sent to AFSFC/FGT. (T-1)  Once approved, they will be added to the Advanced Individual/Team Skills and Proficiency (ASL). (T-1) 4.1.2.1.9.  Training Delivery.  Leader-led training is the preferred delivery method for all SF training.  Trainers, whether S3T or designated flight trainers, will use evaluate-train-evaluate  (ETE)  to  ensure  each  member  is  trained  to  standards  commensurate with  rank  and  duty  position.  (T-3)  This  approach  ensures  members  are  proficient  in the identified task, by first evaluating/identifying weak areas, and in turn, train those areas to a desired level of proficiency.  Under ETE, individuals, teams and flights will not  require  additional  training  if  they  meet  the  required  performance  standard  in  an area  identified  in  the  MNA,  and  codified  in  the  annual  training  plan.    This  method further  ensures  training  resources  are  effectively  focused  on  areas  requiring  greater level of time and resources. 4.1.2.1.10.  Documentation.    Available  Task  Performance  Checklists  (TPC)  located on the AFSFC SMARTNet  website are used to  evaluate members on a GO/NO GO performance standard.  Tasks are trained and qualified to the “Go” level.  “Go” means the  individual  can  perform  the  task  without  assistance  and  meets  local  demands  for accuracy,  timeliness,  and  correct  use  of  procedures.  Once  the  member  receives  a “Go”, the date of completion of the module will be added to member’s AFTR. (T-1)  The  exact  verbiage  to  demonstrate  performance  can  be  determined  by  the  SF  Unit CC.  All checklists should be used to evaluate a specific task or potential situation and should  not  be  used  to  encompass  an  entire  duty  position.  Any  topics  waived  or exempted from the unit’s ATP will be documented.  (T-3) 4.1.2.1.11.  Authorized  Reference  Material.    To  ensure  standardization  of  training across  the  Air  Force,  units  are  only  authorized  to  utilize  the  training  material identified  in  the  SF  HST  Course  Catalog.    When  using  the  ETE  method  to  train  or evaluate  members,  trainers  will  use  available  e-TTPGs,  SF  Training  Reference Guides  (SFTRG),  and  any  HST  reference  material  located  on  the  SMARTNet website.    The  SFTRGs  provide  a  single  source  document  to  use  in  completing training  requirements  outlined  in  the  Specialty  Training  Standard  (STS),  DoDI 5525.15,  Law  Enforcement  (LE)  Standards  and  Training  in  the  DoD  and  Combat Readiness. 4.1.2.1.12.  Implementation  of  SF  HST  Course  Catalog.    All  HST  will  be  selected from the SF HST Course Catalog. (T-1)  The SF HST Course Catalog is located on the  AFSFC  SMARTNet  website.    The  SF  HST  Course  Catalog  is  grouped  into  six distinctive libraries linked to AF/A4S MET obligations and SF Skills.  The libraries supporting  METs  include:  Law  and  Order  Operations  (L&O),  Nuclear  Security (NSL)  and  Military  Working  Dog  (MWDL).    The  libraries  supporting  SF  Skills include: SF Foundational Skills (FSL), SF Expeditionary Skills (ESL) and Advanced Individual/Team  Skills  and  Proficiency  (ASL).    NOTE:  The  MWDL  is  intended  to capture  MWD  training  requirements,  but  is  not  part  of  the  individual’s  216  hour training requirement. 20 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 4.1.2.1.13.  Execution of FSL.  Completion of the entire FSL will be accomplished by all  SF  regardless  of  MET,  mission  or  location  and  will  be  included  in  their  annual training  plan,  unless  waivered  by  the  Career  Field  Manager  (CFM)  or  appropriate authority IAW AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program.  (T-1) 4.1.2.1.14.  Volumes Use.  With the exception of the ASL, the HST is delivered using modules.    Modules  are  a  collection  of  training  topics  intended  to  be  delivered collectively to achieve a specific “tactical level effect”.  Units will select the modules from the appropriate libraries which meet mission needs. (T-1) Although units are not required to complete the entire library (exception FSL and NSL) they are required to train  the  entire  module  selected  unless  the  topic  is  identified  as  exemptible  by AF/A4S.  (T-1)    When  making  module  selection,  considerations  are  given  to  ensure units  meet  all  L&O  requirements  IAW  DoDI  5525.15,  Law  Enforcement  (LE) Standards and Training in the DoD. 4.1.2.1.15.  Training  Commensurate  with  Rank  and  Duty  Position.    With  the understanding  Airmen  are  required  to  perform  at  different  levels,  the  HST  uses  a tiered approach.  Items identified with an “*” in the SF HST Course Catalog are not required to be performed by E-3s and below unless determined by the MAJCOM or SF Unit CC. 4.1.2.1.16.  Training  Commensurate  with  Local  Mission.    Units  are  also  allowed  to exempt themselves from specific training topics (without seeking waiver approval) in any module identified with an “L” in the SFS HST Course Catalog, if the specific line item  falls  outside  of  the  unit’s  mission  obligations  (e.g.,  Exclusive  Jurisdiction Considerations in the Traffic Enforcement Module of the L&O would not be required if the installation does not have exclusive jurisdiction). 4.1.2.1.17.  Application of the ASL.  The ASL is delivered topically and is intended to  allow  the  SF  Unit  CC  to  leverage  HST  to  take  credit  for  required  specialized certifications (e.g., RADAR, Breathalyzer) and qualifications (e.g., special weapons, additional  non-lethal  weapons).    Additionally,  the  ASL  allows  the  SF  Unit  CC  to invest  more  training  time  in  a  specific  capability  already  covered  in  other  libraries (e.g.,  SF  Tactical  Maneuver,  Conduct  Physical  Control  of  Subjects/Suspects,  and Weapon  Proficiency).    This  enhances  unit  capabilities  commensurate  with  the MAJCOM  or  SF  Unit  CC’s  desired  level  of  proficiency.    When  using  the  ASL  to enhance  capabilities  beyond  what  is  delivered  in  previously  covered  modules,  units may  opt  to  use  a  topical  approach  (versus  re-accomplishing  the  entire  module), selecting and focusing on a specific line item.   However, this is additive training and not conducted in lieu of any module from the FSL.  Lastly, the ASL allows SF Unit CCs to take advantage of civilian, state, local, or federal professional training venues to enhance unit capabilities (e.g., interrogation techniques or ForcePRO) and the time attending  these  courses  can  be  applied  to  the  unit’s  107  hours.    In  addition,  intra-service and joint training venues not designated as Professional Military Education or skill  level  awarding  venues  can  also  be  applied  to  the  individual’s  annual  training obligation (e.g., ESS Course, MPI, and IDC3). 4.1.2.1.18.  Approval for topics not captured in ASL.  Although not all inclusive, the ASL  does  capture  some  of  these  training  opportunities  available  to  use  against  the AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 21 unit’s  107  hours  of  training.    If  a  unit  wishes  to  take  advantage  of  professional training  venues  not  identified  in  the  ASL  they  may  seek  AFSFC  approval  of  the venue and the topic for inclusion in the ASL.  NOTE: This only applies to the ASL. 4.1.2.1.19.  Deviation/Waiver Process.  SF Unit CCs will provide written justification through  the  MAJCOM  to  the  AFSFC.

The  AFSFC  will  develop  the  lesson  plan  and  collaborates  with  the  Air  Force  Civil Engineer Center to develop vignettes. (T-1) 4.6.4.  Training frequency will be conducted IAW the AEF Online, pre-deployment training information page at https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/predeployment.aspx. (T-1) 4.6.5.  Instructors will use the approved curriculum and approved lesson plan located on the AFSFC SMARTNet. (T-1) 4.7.  SF Augmentee Program. 4.7.1.  AFPAM  10-243  Augmentation  Duty,  outlines  a  more  flexible,  commander-directed program.   The contents of AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty, are recommendations only and may be used in part or entirely. 4.7.2.  Wing Commanders or equivalent Geographically Separated (GSU) Commanders will determine if an installation augmentation program is required. (T-3) 4.7.3.  If it is determined that a program is needed, it is implemented and managed locally to support ID Force requirements as outlined in AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense. 4.7.4.  SF Augmentee Coordinator, assigned to S-3/Training, coordinates augmentee training with tasked units/agencies. 4.7.5.  SF Augmentee Coordinator will maintain training records for each SF Augmentee. (T-1) 4.7.6.  If utilized, personnel  identified specifically  as SF Augmentees will  be trained on the tasks listed in Attachment 2, SF Augmentee Training Tasks. (T-1)  ID Forces, such as armed owner/user protection personnel, unarmed owner/user protection personnel and unarmed ID Force contributors can use Attachment 2 as potential training items. 30 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 4.7.6.1.  The SF Unit CC may direct additional training requirements to support the local mission. 4.7.7.  All SF Augmentee (AFPAM 10-243, Augmentation Duty) and Unit Marshall training is documented in individual training records. 4.8.  SF Training Resources and Equipment. 4.8.1.  TEEOs.    These  tools  are  developed  at  the  unit  level  and  are  used  by  S-3/Training, Stan/Eval, supervisors/trainers and flight leadership to train and evaluate SF collectively. 4.8.1.1.  As  a  minimum,  SF  units  will  develop  a  TEEO  for  each  of  their  contingency responsibilities as outlined in the installation’s Integrated Defense Plan (IDP). (T-3) 4.8.1.2.  S-3/Training  and  Stan/Eval  will  jointly  develop  localized  TEEOs  and  TPCs  to support their training and evaluation programs. (T-3) 4.8.1.3.  TEEOs  should  be  broad-based  and  capture  the  aspects  of  the  collective  force.  Standards contained within the TEEO should be derived from the IDP and written to the collective level.  For example, “Did responding forces establish final denial to protect the resource?” or “Were the appropriate security requirements established for the Department of Energy (DoE) safe haven?”   Attachment 3 is a sample TEEO. 4.8.1.4.  Task  Performance  Checklist  (TPC)  may  be  used  to  augment  TEEOs  if evaluation of individual tasks is necessary. 4.8.1.5.  S-3/Operations  Officer  or  Superintendent  will  validate  the  TPCs and  ensure  all tasks identified as critical  on the MTL  are also  identified as  critical  on the TPCs. (T-3)  This is annotated on the TPCs or official memorandum. 4.8.2.  S-3/Training uses the CFETP to plan, conduct, evaluate and document training. 4.8.2.1.  The  SF  CFETPs  (31PX/3P0X1AB/  and  0083/0085)  are  the  primary  documents used  to  identify  life-cycle  education  and  training  requirements.      They  serve  as  a  road map  for  SF  career  progression  and  outline  requirements  that  require  completion  at appropriate points throughout the career path. 4.8.2.2.  CFETPs  also  specify  the  mandatory  task  qualification  requirements  for  award and maintenance of an AFSC. 4.8.2.3.  Supervisors use the appropriate CFETP  to  plan, prioritize, manage  and execute training. 4.8.2.4.  CFETPs are used to identify and certify all past and current qualifications. 4.8.3.  SF  Management  and  Automated  Resource  Tracking  Network  (SMARTNet)  website.  The SMARTNet website provides SF members a single portal for access to various training programs, resources and tools.  SF Center of Training Excellence (CTE) also applies a few training programs, resources, and tools. 4.8.4.  Electronics-Tactics,  Techniques,  and  Procedures  Guide  (e-TTPG).    These  guides  are accessible  through  the  AFSFC  SMARTNet  website.    NOTE:  A  pre-filled  AF  Form  689 (TPC)  is  available  for  most  SFTRG  tasks.    These  TPCs  contain  subtasks  associated  with specific  tasks.    The  e-TTPGs  and  the  SFTRGs  are  used  by  S-3/Training,  supervisors  and AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 31 trainers  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  and  can  be  found  on  the  AFSFC  SMARTNet website. 4.8.5.  ULC.    The  ULC  is  an  area,  usually  within  the  unit  and  easily  accessible  to  all  unit members,  that  contains  individual  study  materials,  training  resources  and  computer  access.  Follow these parameters when establishing a ULC: 4.8.5.1.  The  ULC  computers  should  have  network  connection  to  allow  access  to  the individual’s AFTR and other on-line training resources. 4.8.5.2.  Units ensure personnel have access to the ULC to the maximum extent possible. 4.8.6.  Obtaining training equipment  is  a unit responsibility.   Training  equipment  should be standardized  and  consistent  with  approved  duty  equipment.  S-3/Training  ensures  all personnel have access to the training aids to use during Duty Position Qualification Training. 32 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 5 STANDARDIZATION AND EVALUATION (STAN/EVAL) PROGRAM 5.1.  Stan/Eval Program Objective.  The Stan/Eval program allows the SF Unit CC to monitor and  measure  all  unit  functions  by  providing  feedback  on  the  status  of  unit  operations,  mission performance, personnel functions and programs. 5.1.1.  The Stan/Eval section conducts annual inspections of all unit functional areas, and in addition, conducts all initial and subsequent duty position evaluations. 5.1.2.  The Stan/Eval section is a separate work center and reports directly to the SFM.  ARC units  without  Stan/Eval  manpower  authorizations  may  consolidate  training  and  Stan/Eval functions under S-3. 5.2.  Responsibilities. 5.2.1.  HQ USAF/A4S. 5.2.1.1.  Develops policy for the Stan/Eval program. 5.2.2.  AFSFC. 5.2.2.1.  Disseminates guidance to SF Unit CCs on Stan/Eval program requirements. 5.2.3.  Defense Force Commander. 5.2.3.1.  Establishes  a  Stan/Eval  program  as  outlined  by  this  instruction  and  MAJCOM supplement. 5.2.3.2.  Monitors  and  evaluates  the  overall  effectiveness  of  SF  functions  and  personnel by using inspections and evaluations. 5.2.3.3.  Coordinates and staffs inspection items identified by outside agencies. 5.2.3.4.  Reports  the  applicable  training  information  in  the  A3  approved  readiness reporting system IAW AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting. 5.2.3.5.  Validates and endorses all inspection reports. 5.2.4.  Security Forces Manager.  NOTE: This term will be used throughout this instruction and applies to all Security Forces Managers at the squadron or group level. 5.2.4.1.  Manages the unit Stan/Eval Program.  NOTE: The SF Unit CC may oversee the Stan/Eval Program in the ARC unit.  The Custody Forces Manager oversees the program at Munitions Support Squadrons (MUNSS) location. 5.2.4.2.  Provides feedback and recommendations to the SF Unit CC. 5.2.4.3.  Reviews, validates and endorses all Inspection and Trend Analysis Reports. 5.2.5.  Chief Stan/Eval. 5.2.5.1.  Manages the Stan/Eval section.  Ensures all reports are completed in prescribed time and should be a member of the Wing Inspection Team.  Writes the supporting OI for unit,  ensures  the  unit  complies  with  AFI  90-201,  The  Air  Force  Inspection  System,  and AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 33 any  MAJCOM,  AFIMSC,  and  wing  supplements.    Also,  conducts  functional  area inspections. 5.2.6.  NCOIC Stan/Eval. 5.2.6.1.  Manages  all  duty  position  evaluations.   Prepares  all  necessary  reports  and  files them  appropriately.    Works  directly  with  NCOIC  of  training  to  formulate  questions, review TEEOs and TPCs.  Conducts and/or oversees functional area inspections.  Ensures they are completed as scheduled, produces reports and should be a member of the Wing Inspection Team.  NOTE: It is possible, smaller units may have one person covering the two Stan/Eval positions (Chief and NCOIC of Stan/Eval or NCOIC and Evaluator). 5.2.7.  Evaluators. 5.2.7.1.  Schedules,  conducts  duty  position  evaluations,  and  maintains  section  file  plan.  Accounts for all testing material and equipment used for duty position evaluations. 5.3.  Qualifications for Stan/Eval Personnel. 5.3.1.  Personnel assigned to this section perform the critical role of certifying unit members to  perform  SF  Unit  CC  identified  duty  positions  and  validate  unit  functional  areas  are performing  within  standards.    These  individuals  should  possess  excellent  communicative skills,  breadth  of  experience  and  be  extremely  knowledgeable  of  the  overall  functioning  of the unit. 5.3.2.  When  necessary,  Stan/Eval  may  elicit  unit  SMEs  to  assist  in  conducting  the performance  portion  of  DPEs  for  specialized  positions  (e.g.,  MWD  handler  and  alarm monitors).  Stan/Eval will appoint SMEs for the unit in writing and endorsed by the SFM.  At a minimum, unit evaluators (to include SMEs who augment Stan/Eval) will be task qualified (signed off in AFTR) on the tasks they evaluate while conducting DPEs. (T-1) 5.4.  Standard/Evaluation Functions. 5.4.1.  Functional Area Inspection Program. 5.4.1.1.  Stan/Eval  will  inspect  or  ensure  each  unit  functional  area  or  work  center  is inspected every 12 months. (T-1)  ARC tenant and associate units will conduct functional area inspections at least every 24 months. (T-1) 5.4.1.2.  Stan/Eval will organize an inspection team composed of unit SMEs (as needed) when performing inspections of functional areas or work centers within the SF unit.  (T-3) NOTE: It is highly encouraged that these inspections are cross-functional and a SME does not inspect their own section. 5.4.1.3.  Stan/Eval will coordinate with the unit SFM and Group SFM “if applicable” to identify inspection criteria and performance standards. (T-3)  Headquarters Air Force and MAJCOM  (if  applicable)  Self-Assessment  Communicators  are  utilized  when  inspecting functional  areas  or  work  centers.  Reference  AFI  90-201,  The  Air  Force  Inspection System, for further information detailing the MICT Self-Assessment Communicators. 5.4.1.3.1.  Headquarters  Air  Force  and  MAJCOM  MICT  Self-Assessment Communicators are tools for use by Higher Headquarters (HHQ) and unit personnel when  conducting  assessments  of  programs  or  activities.    They  do  not  constitute  the order or limit  the scope of any  HHQ or unit self- inspection.  They do not  limit the 34 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 requirement  to  comply  with  any  published  DoD  and  AF  policies,  directives  or instructions. 5.4.1.3.2.  Units  are  highly  encouraged  to  develop  and  use  local  MICT  Self-Assessment  Communicators  during  Functional  Area  Inspections.    The  development of local MICT Self-Assessment Communicators ensures local policies and procedures not  identified  within  the  AF/MAJCOM  Self-Assessment  Communicators  are  being captured and inspected. 5.4.1.4.  Units  may  substitute  a  Commanders  Inspection  Program  (CCIP)  or  HHQ inspection  (Inspector  General  or  MAJCOM  Staff  Assistance  Visit)  for  an  annual Stan/Eval  Functional  Area  Inspection  if  the  inspection  activity  used  HAF  Self-Assessment  Communicators.    NOTE:  If  substituting  a  HHQ  inspection  for  an  annual Stan/Eval  Functional  Area  Inspection  and  not  all  functional  areas  or  work  centers  were inspected,  Stan/Eval  is  still  responsible  for  inspecting  those  functional  areas  or  work centers to meet the annual requirement. 5.4.2.  Stan/Eval Inspection Report Preparation and Processing. 5.4.2.1.  Stan/Eval  will  at  a  minimum  ensure  each  functional  area  is  inspected  utilizing HAF  MICT  Self-Assessment  Communicators  and  any  additional  mission  related  Self-Assessment  Communicators.  (T-2)  Stan/Eval  will  generate  a  new  inspection  report,  not the  program  owner.    Stan/Eval  will  annotate  deficiencies  and  observations  within  the inspection and notify the SFM for review within 3 duty days after the inspection. (T-3) 5.4.2.2.  The  unit  SFM  and  Group  SFM  “if  applicable”  will  review  inspections.  (T-3)  The SFM notifies the SF Unit CC on all MICT reports. After the SF Unit CC reviews the report, it is sent to the inspected area to correct any deficient areas discovered during the inspection.    After  all  deficiencies  have  been  corrected  and  closed,  the  owning  section initiates a new inspection within MICT. 5.4.3.  Duty Position Evaluation.  This evaluation measures an individual’s ability to perform duties  within  a  given  duty  position  and  also  validates  the  effectiveness  of  the  training provided to the individual being evaluated.  A DPE consists of the following: 5.4.3.1.  Verbal  Evaluation.    The  verbal  evaluation  consists  of  a  question-and-answer period.   These verbal questions are subject-knowledge and task-knowledge based and are formulated  using the  duty  position  under consideration as found on the work center MTL. Avoid questions that elicit a one-word response. training  references  associated  with 5.4.3.1.1.  Assign  point  values  to  questions  in  advance  of  the  verbal  evaluation;  the evaluation will be at least 25-questions. (T-2) 5.4.3.1.2.  Units  will  establish  local  procedures  to  secure  all  forms  of  testing  media used for verbal tests. (T-3) 5.4.3.2.  Written  Evaluation.    Written  evaluations  are  not  required,  but  MAJCOMs  may direct  a  written  evaluation  in  the  DPE  process.    If  required,  they  provide  clear,  written guidance  to  subordinate  units  on  all  aspects  of  the  written  portion  to  include  but  not limited to: how many questions in the test, type of test (multiple choice, scenario based, forms,  etc.),  securing  data,  scoring/rating  and  failures/decertification.    Questions  are AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 35 subject-knowledge  and  task-knowledge  based  and  are  formulated  using  training references,  associated  with  the  duty  position  under  consideration  as  found  on  the  work center MTL, to include standard forms associated with the duty position. 5.4.3.3.  Performance  Evaluation.    This  evaluation  measures  the  individual’s  ability  to successfully perform the duties for the specific duty position under consideration using a Unit Commander approved TPCs. 5.4.3.3.1.  Performance  evaluations  are  conducted  during  the  normal  duty  schedule and  while  the  individual  is  on  post  or  in  their  work  center.  Members  may  also  be evaluated during real world events if it meets Stan/Eval intent for performance. 5.4.3.3.2.  Team  positions  are  evaluated  while  the  member  is  performing  duties  as part of the team. 5.4.3.3.3.  Immediately  following the evaluation,  Stan/Eval  provides feedback to  the individual/team.  Performance evaluations use the Go/No-Go rating system. 5.4.3.3.4.  Simulated  firearms  will  be  of  a  color  that  is  immediately  distinguishable from real weapons. (T-1) 5.4.3.3.5.  As  a  minimum,  control  measures  will  include  the  development  of  a  local method to uniquely identify each simulated firearm and accountability procedures to record when they are signed in/out by unit personnel. (T-1) 5.4.3.3.6.  If  an  armed  SF  is  being  evaluated,  the  duty  weapons  will  be  treated  the same  as  a  flight  level  exercise  with  emphasis  on  weapons  safety.  (T-1)  Non-lethal weapons  will  not  be  removed  from  their  approved  holster.  (T-1)  A  weapon  safety announcement will be communicated to all participating personnel. (T-1) 5.4.4.  Duty  Position  Categories.    Duty  positions  are  categorized  as  critical  or  non-critical.  The SF Unit CC will identify all S-3/Flight duty positions (critical and non-critical) either in a  local  Operating  Instruction  (OI)  or  official  memorandum.  (T-2)    All  S-3/Flight  duty positions will be certified by Stan/Eval. (T-2)   A  critical  position 5.4.4.1.  Critical  Positions. requires  precise accomplishment of assigned duties crucial to mission accomplishment.  Individuals will not  perform  independently  in  a  critical  duty  position  until  successfully  completing  the DPE process. (T-2)   NOTE: While in Duty Position Qualification Training, individuals may  perform  in  a  critical  duty  position,  as  an  alternate,  and  must  be  under  continuous supervision  from  an individual DPE certified in  that  position. (T-2)  The  duty positions listed below are designated as critical. is  one that 5.4.4.1.1.  Key positions in direct support of nuclear resources. 5.4.4.1.2.  Convoy Commanders. 5.4.4.1.3.  Nuclear Area Supervisors. 5.4.4.1.4.  Limited Area Entry Controller & Limited Area Close In Sentry. 5.4.4.1.5.  Exclusion Area Entry Controllers. 5.4.4.1.6.

Any  duty  positions  designated  critical  by  the  MAJCOM  or  unit  SF  Unit CC. 5.4.4.2.  Non-critical positions.  Non-critical positions are those positions whose exacting accomplishment of assigned duties is less crucial to the accomplishment of the mission. 5.4.4.2.1.  At the discretion of the SF Unit CC individuals may work non-critical duty positions independently prior to being certified through the DPE process.  If allowed, the  SF  Unit  CC  identifies  these  non-critical  duty  positions  in  a  local  OI  or  official memorandum.    Additionally,  if  allowed  by  the  SF  Unit  CC  the  individual  must  be task-qualified  (annotated  in  AFTR)  on  all  critical  tasks  associated  with  these  duty positions,  as  identified  on  the  work  center  MTL,  prior  to  the  trainee  working  that particular non-critical position independently. (T-2) 5.4.4.3.  DPE Cycle.  The DPE cycle initiates when S-3/Training notifies Stan/Eval of an individual’s  completion  of  Duty  Position  Qualification  Training.    Within  30  calendar days  of  being  notified,  Stan/Eval  completes  the  initial  DPE  for  personnel  assigned  to active  duty  units  (includes  AFRC  and  ANG  personnel  while  assigned  to  an  active  duty unit). 5.4.4.3.1.  Non-critical certifications are valid for a period of 18 months.  Subsequent certifications must be completed by the last day of the anniversary month. (T-2)  For example,  if  an  individual  is  certified  on  5  Jan  12,  the  subsequent  DPE  must  be completed  by  31  Jul  13.    If  a  recertification  is  not  completed  by  the  end  of  the anniversary month, the certification expires. 5.4.4.3.2.  Critical duty certifications are valid for a period of 12 months.  Subsequent certifications must be completed by the last day of the anniversary month. (T-2)  For example,  an  individual  is  certified  on  5  Jan  12,  the  subsequent  DPE  must  be completed  by  31  Jan  13.    If  a  recertification  is  not  completed  by  the  end  of  the anniversary month, the certification expires. 5.4.4.3.3.  IMAs and ARC members on orders or activated for 120 days or more are evaluated  every  24  months  for  a  non-critical  duty  position  and  every  18  months  for critical  duty  positions.  NGB/A4S  and  AFRC/A4S  outline  DPE  timelines  for  Drill Status  Guard  (DSG)  and  traditional  Reserve  members  who  perform  an  installation security  mission.  Air  Reserve  Technicians  maintains  the  same  duty  position qualification timelines as active duty. 5.4.4.3.4.  Deployment  cycles  are  taken  into  account  when  scheduling  subsequent DPEs.  Units should recertify expiring duty certifications prior to deployments. 5.4.4.3.5.  If a recertification for non-critical duty positions expires while the member is  deployed  the  SF  Unit  CC  or  higher  may  grant  the  member  a  45  calendar  day AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 37 extension  from  the  date  of  returning  to  official  duty.  For  critical  duty  positions individual  will  be  considered  not  qualified  upon  returning  to  home  station  official duty and they must complete a recertification in that DPE. (T-2) 5.4.4.3.6.  Supervisors will annotate any delay in the DPE cycle and the cause of the delay in the individual's AFTR. (T-1) The unit develops local procedures to ensure S-3/Training and Stan/Eval are notified of the delay and its cause. 5.4.4.3.7.  Contracted  Personnel.    Evaluate  contract  personnel  as  identified  in  the SOW  or  PWS.    NOTE:  Evaluation  results  should  be  made  available  to  Quality Assurance Evaluators (QAE). 5.4.4.3.8.  DAF  CP/SG  Employees.    Evaluate  using  the  DPE  Cycle  as  outlined  in paragraphs 5.4.3. and 5.4.4. 5.4.4.4.  If an individual requires evaluation for multiple duty positions with similar tasks, they  may  be  evaluated  all  at  once  during  one  DPE  (e.g.,  Internal  Security  Response Team/External  Security  Response  Team  members).    The  NCOIC  of  Stan/Eval  must ensure  combined  evaluations  adequately  encompass  the  duties  of  each  duty  position.  Stan/Eval, may evaluate multiple personnel as long as the section can adequately observe and  evaluate  them  properly.    Real-world  incidents  may  count  as  evaluations  if  it  meets the  scope  of  the  performance  scenario.  MAJCOMs,  AFIMSC  and  SF  Unit  CCs  may direct additional no-notice evaluations. 5.4.4.5.  If  approved  by  the  SF  Unit  CC  persons  having  fewer  than  90  calendar  days remaining  until  discharge,  retirement,  retraining  or  are  within  90  calendar  days  of permanent  change  of  station  may  be  exempted  from  DPEs.    IMAs  and  ARC  with  less than  180  calendar  days  remaining  until  discharge,  retirement  or  retraining  may  be exempted  from  DPEs.    ANG  personnel  with  less  than  six  RSD  or  180  days  remaining (whichever is less) may also be exempted by the SF Unit CC.  If approved by the SF Unit CC  these  individuals  are  still  considered  certified  in  the  duty  positions  they  hold (critical/non-critical).    The  SF  Unit  CC’s  approval  of  exemptions  should  be  in memorandum format (filed in Stan/Eval) or as a blanket exemption in a local OI. 5.4.5.  DPE Documentation.  Final reports are produced to provide an overview of each DPE.  The report contains a minimum of the verbal evaluation score and written evaluation score (if required).    In  addition,  the  report  provides  a  synopsis  of  the  duty  position  performance evaluation scenario and the subject area deficiencies for all portions of the DPE.  Evaluator notes from the performance portion of the DPE will be transcribed from the TPC or similar computer  generated  product  to  the  final  report.  (T-2)    This  report  will  be  filed  within Stan/Eval. (T-2)  The supervisor will document successful completion of the DPE in AFTR via  623a  entry.  (T-2)    A  copy  of  the  report  is  provided  to  the  individual’s  supervisor,  S-3/Operations Superintendent, S-3/Training, SFM, and SF Unit CC. 5.4.6.  DPE 623a example On  this  date________Member  completed  DPE  on________(position).    Member  received  a PASS  on  verbal,  a  PASS  on  written.    Member  completed________(scenario).    Deficiencies identified  were________.    Additional  evaluator  notes  are________.    Member  (passed,  failed) DPE. 38 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 5.5.  Evaluation and Rating System. 5.5.1.  For  non-critical  duty  positions,  individuals  must  receive  at  least  a  70%  to  pass  the verbal portion of the DPE. (T-2)  For critical duty positions, individuals must receive at least an 80% to pass the verbal portion of the DPE. (T-2) 5.5.2.  Individuals must also earn a “Go” on the performance portion of their DPE. (T-2)  The SF Unit CC determines if performance requires the individual to physically demonstrate the task  or  explain  the  material.    A  “Go”  means  the  individual  can  perform  the  duties  without assistance  and  meets  local  demands  for  accuracy,  timeliness  and  correct  use  of  procedures.  This  does  not  necessarily  translate  to  requiring  an  error  free  performance  evaluation  to receive a “Go”, but does mandate individuals successfully perform all critical tasks that were evaluated  during  the  performance  portion  of  DPEs.    These  critical  tasks  must  be  identified for  every  unit  S-3/Flight  duty  position  (critical  and  non-critical)  and  reflected  on  the  MTL and  correlating  TPC.  (T-2)  For  example,  the  TPC  used  by  Stan/Eval  to  evaluate  a  duty position  during  an  alarm  response  contains  35  specific  tasks;  the  unit  has  designated  28  of these  tasks  as  being  critical  for  the  DPE  of  alarm  monitor.    Due  to  the  complexity  of  each exercise  scenario  it  is  not  required  to  evaluate  all  items  on  the  TPCs  used.      However,  to successfully  pass  the  performance  portion  of  the  DPE  and  receive  a  “Go”,  all  critical performance  tasks  which  were  measured  during  the  DPE  must  be  successfully  completed without assistance.  (T-2) 5.5.3.  Duty Position Evaluation Failures. 5.5.3.1.  If the verbal, written  (if required) or performance portion of a DPE is failed, the trainee will be allotted no more than 30 calendar days of supervisor/trainer-administered review  training  prior  to  being  rescheduled  for  a  reevaluation.  (T-2)    NOTE:  NGB/A4S and  AFRC/A4S  will  outline  DPE  review  training  timeline  requirements  for  DSG  and traditional Reserve members who perform an installation security mission.  Air Reserve Technicians will maintain the same timelines as active duty. (T-1) 5.5.3.2.  When  an  individual  fails  a  DPE,  the  S-3/Operations  Officer  (or  SF  Unit  CC designee  for  units  not  having  an  S-3/Operations  Officer)  and  S-3/Operations Superintendent  or  the  appropriate  section  superintendent  will  determine  which  training requirements  will  be  reviewed  based  upon  recommendations  from  the  individual’s immediate  chain  of  command  and  the  DPE  report.  (T-3)  The  supervisor/trainer  ensures the recommended training plan is annotated in the member’s AFTR. The SF Unit CC and SFM will be notified and briefed on the failure and the recommended courses of action. 5.5.3.3.  The  individual's  supervisor/trainer  re-trains  the  task(s)  and  annotates  the trainee’s  AFTR  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  and  notifies  S-3/Training when review training is completed. S-3/Training verifies completion of review training and notifies Stan/Eval to reschedule the failed portion(s) of the DPE. Stan/Eval reevaluates  the  individual  no  later  than  30  calendar  days  after  being  notified  by  S-3/Training and reviewing the individuals AFTR. NOTE: NGB/A4S and AFRC/A4S will outline  reevaluation  training  timelines  for  DSG  and  traditional  Reserve  members  who perform an installation security mission. Air Reserve Technicians will maintain the same reevaluation timelines as active duty. AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 39 5.5.3.4.  The SF Unit  CC and SFM, in  coordination with  the S-3/Operations  Officer (or SF  Unit  CC  designee  for  units  not  having  an  S-3/Operations  Officer)  and  S-3/Superintendent  approves  supervisor/trainer-administered  review  training  requirements for subsequent DPE failures. 5.5.3.5.  Critical DPE Failures.  Members are not allowed to work in that position without direct supervision until successfully completing a reevaluation. 5.5.3.6.  Non-critical DPE Failures.  The SF Unit CC may authorize members who have failed  a  DPE  to  work  in  that  position  while  awaiting  their  reevaluation,  but  only  after completion of review training as outlined in paragraphs 5.5.3.2. and 5.5.3.3. 5.5.4.  Duty  Position  Decertification.    This  process  is  reserved  for  instances  where  an individual’s  proficiency  in  or  suitability  for  a  specific  duty  position  has  been  called  into question.  Recommendations to decertify normally come from supervisors/flight leadership, but can also  come from personnel in unit leadership positions.  The SF Unit CC designates decertification authority, by position, in a local OI or an appointment letter. 5.5.4.1.  If  reconsidered  for  the  duty  position  after  decertification,  the  individual's supervisor/trainer  conducts  review  training  on  the  deficient  task(s)  and  annotates  the trainee’s  AFTR  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Air  Force  Training  Program,  and  notifies  S-3/Training  when  review  training  is  completed.    The  trainee  is  given  no  more  than  30 calendar days of review training prior to being scheduled for a reevaluation. 5.5.4.2.  S-3/Training  verifies  completion  of  review  training  and  notifies  Stan/Eval  to schedule  a  complete  DPE  (verbal,  written  [if  required]  and  performance).  Stan/Eval reevaluates  the  individual  no  later  than  30  calendar  days  after  being  notified  by  S-3/Training.  NOTE:  NGB/A4S  and  AFRC/A4S  outlines  reevaluation  training  timelines for DSG and traditional Reserve members who perform an installation security mission. (T-2) 5.6.  Duty Position Evaluation Records Disposition. 5.6.1.  Distribute copies of the DPE final report to the individual’s supervisor, S-3/Operations Superintendent,  S-3/Training,  SFM,  SF  Unit  CC  and  the  member  evaluated.  NOTE:  This requirement may be accomplished using electronic means. 5.6.2.  Stan/Eval  maintains  the  original  evaluation  report  IAW  the  Air  Force  Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). 5.7.  Trend Analysis Report. 5.7.1.  Stan/Eval provides a quarterly trend analysis to the SF Unit CC, SFM, S-3/Operations Officer/Superintendent  and  S-3/Training.    The  analysis  focuses  on  individual  DPE  reports from the previous quarter.  ARC units will conduct the trend analysis on a yearly basis.  This analysis is designed to provide the SF Unit CC feedback on the status of the unit’s training program and highlight areas where training should be more focused. 5.7.2.  Sanitized  trend  analysis  reports  should  be  made  available  to  all  unit  personnel;  this ensures  any  trends  (negative  or  positive)  are  corrected  or  reinforced  during  duty  position qualification training and flight-level exercises. 40 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 6 SECURITY FORCES EXPEDITIONARY PROGRAM 6.1.  SF Expeditionary Training Program Concept.  The SF Expeditionary Training Program incorporates  Expeditionary  Readiness  Training  (ERT)  and  SF  CRT.    ERT  is  administered  at home station, RTC, and other ADR or approved DoD training venues. 6.2.  Responsibilities. 6.2.1.  Director of Security Forces (AF/A4S). 6.2.1.1.  Develops SF CRT policy. 6.2.2.  SF Officer (AF/A4S appointed), Enlisted (AF/A4SM) and Civilian (A4SX) CFM. 6.2.2.1.  Establishes SF ERT policies and direction. 6.2.3.  AFSFC. 6.2.3.1.  Publishes SF CRT. 6.2.3.2.  Ensures  development,  standardization  and  evaluation  of  SF  ERT  and  CRT objectives and requirements. 6.2.3.3.  Manages SF ERT, CRT and provides guidance to MAJCOMs. 6.2.3.4.  Schedules  all  SF  postured  against  a  DW  coded  UTC  as  provided  by  the  HQ AFIMSC Expeditionary Support Directorate. 6.2.3.5.  Will provide SF ERT and CRT guidance to units. 6.2.3.6.  Works  in  unison  with  the  HQ  AFIMSC  Expeditionary  Support  Directorate  to ensure  SF  tasked  to  deploy  receive  specialized  training  as  directed  by  their  deployment line remarks. 6.2.3.7.  . Ensures SF tasked to deploy receive required ADR training as scheduled. 6.2.3.8.  .  Ensures  SF  postured  against  a  DW-coded  UTC,  but  not  tasked  during  their deployment vulnerability window, receive ECCeRT sustainment training at an approved SF RTC. 6.2.4.  Defense Force Commander. 6.2.4.1.  Appoints an ERT Manager in writing. 6.2.4.2.  Ensures all SF ERT and CRT requirements are met. 6.2.4.3.  Develops  a  deployment  schedule  that  provides  a  measure  of  predictability  for assigned personnel that meets the applicable AEF battle rhythm. 6.2.4.4.  Ensures  the  AEF  UTC  Reporting  Tool  (ART)  report  accurately  illustrates  and validates  assessments  and  remarks  for  the  UTC  capability  in  a  timely  manner.    This  is completed every 30 days or within 24 hours of a status change as outlined in AFI 10-244, Reporting Status of Aerospace Expeditionary Forces. AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 41 6.2.4.5.  Ensures the AF-IT report depicts the unit’s status, based on the ability to execute the mission-set for which it was organized or designed and the mission against which it is employed. The unit uses all Designed Operational Capability (DOC) statements (mobility and  home  station)  when  completing  AF-IT  report.    This  is  completed  every  30  days  or within 24 hours of a status change affecting the unit’s overall C-level, the four measured area levels, associated reason codes, deployed reason codes, and get well date changes as outlined in AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting. 6.2.5.  Unit S-3/Training. 6.2.5.1.  Performs as ERT Manager, ensuring all SF members meet the appropriate ERT tiered training requirements. 6.2.6.  Unit S-4/Unit Deployment Manager (UDM). 6.2.6.1.  Manages deployment readiness and ensures required training is complete for all deployable personnel. 6.2.6.2.  Performs UTC development, management and maintenance activities IAW AFI 10-401,  Air  Force  Operations  Planning  and  Executions  and  AFI  10-403,  Air  Force Operations Planning and Execution. 6.3.  Security Forces Readiness Training. 6.3.1.  Security  Forces  Readiness  Training  is  a  combination  of  individual  and  collective skills.  It  provides  every  SF  member  with  the  capability  to  shoot,  move  and  communicate.  Readiness  training  provides  the  foundation  upon  which  every  SF  member’s  mission preparation begins and directly contributes to combat readiness. 6.3.2.  Readiness Training Center training must be accomplished by all SF postured against a DW  coded  UTC.  (T-1)    Those  personnel  not  scheduled  for  a  deployment  tasking  will complete their RTC training within 180 days prior to entering their deployment vulnerability window. (T-1)  DW coded forces postured as enablers will complete RTC training every 24 months. (T-1)  All personnel who are scheduled to deploy in their deployment vulnerability window are scheduled by  AFSFC/FGC to  attend an RTC  as close to  their available to  load date  (ALD)  or  within  180  days  of  required  delivery  date  (RDD).  AFIMSC  FAMS  should work  closely  with  the  AFSFC/FGC  to  ensure  all  members  within  their  MAJCOM  attend RTC  training  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  above.    AFIMSC  FAMS  work  with AFSFC/FGC to provide further guidance regarding who is required to complete RTC training above  and  beyond  this  baseline  requirement  for  availability  as  deployment  backfills  and ensure  DOC  response  times  can  be  met.    Members  completing  RTC  training  must  be proficient in the required CRT tasks identified in the Home Station Training (HST) table. (T-1)  ARC personnel not scheduled for a deployment will complete RTC training as scheduled by AFSFC/FGC, AFRC/A4S and NGB/A4S. 6.3.3.  SF  tasked  to  deploy  must  be  proficient  on  all  FSL,  CRT,  AF  Home  Station Deployment-Ready ERT and ADR training requirements. (T-1) 6.3.4.  To  be  considered  proficient,  Defenders  must  train  using  the  evaluate-train-evaluate methodology  demonstrating  proficiency  on  FSL,  CRT,  and  AF  Home  Station  Deployment-Ready ERT tasks.  The CRT task is a pre-requisite to RTC and must be completed prior to attendance and must remain current throughout the vulnerability period. (T-2) 42 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 6.4.  Expeditionary Readiness Program (ERP). 6.4.1.  AF Expeditionary Skills (ES) are defined as the knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA) required  of  a  deployment-ready  defender  essential  to  survive,  operate  and  succeed  in  a deployed environment, while reinforcing a strong warrior ethos. 6.4.1.1.  SF  will  complete  the  Expeditionary  Readiness  Program  (ERP)  as  outlined  in AFGM 2015-10-01, Air Force Guidance Memorandum for Expeditionary Readiness. (T-1) 6.4.1.2.  These skills are obtained through a tiered training approach and target KSAs not routinely  acquired  during  occupational  and/or  other  ancillary  training  venues.  ERP  is relevant,  synchronized,  standardized  and  integrated  across  the  Air  Force  to  provide Combatant  Commanders  with  Defenders  trained  to  support  that  theater’s  requirements, while maximizing resources.  ERT is optimized when incorporated as a continuum across a defender’s career and aligned with mission tasking and deployments. 6.4.2.  Basic  Airman  Readiness  (BAR).    BAR  for  all  Defenders  is  delivered  through accessions,  initial  occupational  training,  and  sustained  through  developmental  education.  Defenders gain skills through Basic Military Training, Officer Accession venues, and 3-skill level  initial  training.    Completion  of  this  training  alone  does  not  produce  a  deployable defender. 6.4.3.  Basic Deployment Readiness (BDR).  BDR for all Defenders is delivered at the wing level  in  alignment  with  assigned  deployment  bands.    Additionally,  SF  will  train  using  the FSL  and  Combat  Readiness  Training  Library  (CRTL)  as  outlined  in  Chapter  4.    BDR  is designed to ensure every defender maintains proficiency and sustains readiness currency for deployment so SF Unit  CCs have maximum  flexibility to  efficiently  execute BDR training.  Categories,  requirements,  frequencies  and  a  current  list  of  BDR  training  is  available  at: https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFRIT/afrit.aspx?cat=16. 6.4.3.1.  Defenders  will  maintain  Expeditionary  Skills  proficiency  by  completing  BDR training  as  they  prepare  for  their  postured  deployment  vulnerability  period  (reference AFPD 10-4, Operations Planning: Air and Space Expeditionary Forces).  These training requirements  must  be  accomplished  by  all  members  in  preparation  for  their  assigned deployment  vulnerability  period  and  are  fulfilled  by  completing  the  computer-based training (CBT) on ADLS at: https://golearn.adls.af.mil. (T-1) 6.4.3.2.  SF  Unit  CCs  will  provide  training  to  those  Defenders  tasked  to  deploy  or  to maintain  mission-ready  status  to  support  major  combat  operations.    Home  station  pre-deployment training is a combination of ADLS, standardized classroom and standardized hands-on  instruction.    This  training  will  also  serve  as  the  prerequisite  training  for Defenders  to  attend  ADR  training.    NOTE:  If  directed  response  times  in  Mission Capability  (MISCAP)  or  Designed  Operational  Capability  (DOC)  statements  preclude units  from  completing  training  requirements  on  a  “just  in  time”  basis,  the  owning MAJCOM may direct this training to be completed on a recurring basis. 6.4.4.  Advanced  Deployment  Readiness,  ADR  (Mission  Specific).    This  is  determined  by factors including: deployment location, threat assessment, specific mission, duty assignment, role, operation or special requirements.  Training is focused on pre-deployment training that supports  both  traditional  taskings  and  non-traditional  USAF  missions  that  support  other AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 43 Combatant Commanders’ taskings or for programs unique to the MAJCOMs.  Completion of this advanced training prepares a defender for a specific deployment tasking. 6.4.5.  SF  RTC  ADR  curriculum  and  the  820th  Base  Defense  Group  (BDG)  training  plan (which includes SF RTC ADR curriculum) has been certified by HQ AETC/A3Q as meeting the  ADR  training  requirements,  outlined  in  AFGM  2015-10-01,  Air  Force  Guidance Memorandum  for  Expeditionary  Readiness.    NOTE:  Only  Defenders  assigned  to  the  820 BDG may attend training at the 820 BDG.  This organization is not authorized to operate as an RTC for members outside of its assigned personnel.  There may be instances where non-820  BDG  Airmen  will  be  teamed  down  range  on  specific  mission  sets.    In  those  cases, AFSFC  may  approve  non-820  BDG  personnel  obtaining  ADR  training  with  the  820  BDG.  These instances will be case-by-case and coordinated with 820 BDG in advance. (T-1) 6.4.6.  Integrated Defense Command and Control Course (IDC3).  The IDC3 was developed to  provide  training  in  the  knowledge  and  skills  needed  to  perform  a  Headquarters/BDOC staff position. 6.4.6.1.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  SF  Unit  CCs  make  every  effort  to  have  SNCOs ((M)Sgt  through  CMSgt)  and  Officers  (Captain  through  Colonel)  assigned  to  a  SF Headquarters UTC (QFEBA, QFEBB and QFEBS) attend the course. 6.4.6.2.  Individuals in the target grade who are not assigned to an SF Headquarters UTC may  also  attend  the  course  as  determined  by  the  AFSFC  and  parent  MAJCOM  or AFIMSC and availability of unfilled seats. 6.4.6.3.  Refer  to  the  ETCA  website  at  https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp  for course specifics. 6.4.7.  Combat  Leaders  Course  (CLC).    The  CLC  was  developed  to  provide  training  in  the knowledge and skills needed to perform in an SF Squad Leader position. 6.4.7.1.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  SF  Unit  CCs  make  every  effort  to  have NCO/SNCOs (SrA with a promotion line number or SSgt-MSgt) assigned to an SF Squad Leader position attends this course.  Grade waivers will not be considered for attendance in this course. (T-2) 6.4.7.2.  AFSFC  will  implement  a  selection  process  to  manage  their  annual  training quotas in this course. (T-2) 6.4.7.3.  Refer  to  the  ETCA  website  at  https://etca.randolph.af.mil/default1.asp  for course specifics. 6.5.  SF Pre-deployment Training Requirement. 6.5.1.  SF  who  have  been  postured  and  tasked  to  meet  known  rotational  expeditionary requirements  and  emerging  operational  requirements  will  receive  ADR,  mission-specific training  at  an  approved  SF  RTC  or  other  approved  ADR  training  site  as  scheduled  by AFSFC/FGC. (T-1) 6.5.2.  DAF  CPs  (0083)  will  comply  with  active  duty  requirements  for  FSL,  CRT  and  AF ERT only when deploying. (T-1) DAF CP/SGs are exempt from ECCeRT requirements. 6.5.3.  MAJCOMs may increase frequency of ECCeRT training as seats are available and at their own expense. 44 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 6.5.3.1.  SF Unit CCs will utilize these personnel to fulfill replacement requirements. (T-1) 6.5.3.1.1.  SF  who  deploy  as  replacements  must  receive  the  same  mission  specific training  as  identified  in  the  original  deployment  line  remarks,  unless  an  ERT exemption is approved IAW AFGM 2015-10-01, Air Force Guidance Memorandum for Expeditionary Readiness. (T-1) 6.5.3.1.2.  This  training  will  be  scheduled  by  AFSFC  to  coincide  with  their  current assigned deployment prep window as outlined in AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution. (T-1) 6.5.4.  Attendance  at  an  SF  RTC  will  be  documented  in  the  member’s  AFTR  by  a trainer/supervisor.  (T-1)  The  RTC  report  card  will  be  used  as  documentation  of  training completion. (T-1) 6.5.5.  SF  personnel  who  attend  an  ADR  training  site  per  deployment  line  remark  (such  as Air Advisor Course or a Power Projection Platform) are not required to attend an SF RTC. 6.5.6.  Non-SF personnel assigned to SF units who are postured and/or tasked to deploy will complete  ERT  requirements  as  outlined  in  AFGM  2015-10-01,  Air  Force  Guidance Memorandum for Expeditionary Readiness. (T-2) 6.5.7.  Members deploying with or in support of an SF mission are encouraged to train with their deploying team at an SF RTC. 6.6.  Training Exemptions. 6.6.1.  AFGM 2015-10-01, Air Force Guidance Memorandum for Expeditionary Readiness, is the governing directive for ERT Exemptions. 6.6.1.1.  SF that have completed ECCeRT and ADR training at an approved SF RTC and are  tasked  within  their  vulnerability  window  are  considered  trained  and  will  only  be required to complete the theater entry requirements by the ALD. (T-2) 6.6.2.  Units  must  submit  justification  for  exemption  via  memorandum  through  the MAJCOM to the AFIMSC for approval. (T-1) 6.6.3.  AFSFC will coordinate the exemption with AETC/A3Q (lead MAJCOM for ERT) and ACC/A3O (exemption approval authority). (T-1) 6.6.4.  If approved and the individual is deploying to a hostile/uncertain environment, the unit will use one of the following processes based upon deployment tasking. 6.6.4.1.  Joint Expeditionary Task (JET)/Individual Augmentee (IA) Tasking.  Units will use  the  JET/IA  CST  Exemption  Request  form  located  on  the  AEF  Online  Air  Force Reporting at:  https://aef.afpc.randolph.af.mil/AFRIT/afrit.aspx?cat=16. (T-1) Instructions Tool page 6.6.4.2.  Non-JET/IA  Tasking.    Units  will  use  the  guidance  in  AFI  10-403,  Deployment Planning and Execution, to request exemption of deployment tasking line remarks. (T-1) AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 45 Chapter 7 SECURITY FORCES READINESS TRAINING CENTER PROGRAM 7.1.  Security Forces Readiness Training Centers (RTC). 7.1.1.  SF  RTCs  are  SF  units  with  a  mission  to  deliver  relevant,  focused  and  up-to-date training  for  the  individual  defender  or  team.  Training  includes  timely  updates  on  the  latest enemy  TTPs,  use  of  ranges  for  field  training,  specialized  technology  and  equipment  and small team leadership opportunities. 7.1.2.

Owning MAJCOMs may also develop MAJCOM-specific checklists to ensure RTCs are in compliance with MAJCOM specific training standards. 7.6.10.5.  AFSFC/FGTR  will  review  all  checklists  annually  and  ensure  checklists  are updated  within  90  days  of  guidance  with  changes  being  posted  on  the  AF  e-Publishing website. (T-1) 7.6.11.  Areas of periodic course review: 7.6.11.1.  RTC Course Management and Support. 7.6.11.1.1.  Instructor Certification 7.6.11.1.2.  Operations 7.6.11.1.3.  Student Documentation 7.6.11.1.4.  Student Critiques 7.6.11.1.5.  Awards 7.6.11.2.  Utilization of standardized RTC curriculum. 7.6.11.3.  C-IED Lane. AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 57 7.6.12.  Critical objectives are identified on the RTC periodic course review checklist and if not met initially can be corrected during the periodic course review and are not grounds for an immediate decertification. 7.6.13.  Objectives are validated using the Meets, Meets with Comments, and Does Not Meet scale. 7.6.14.  Decertification. 7.6.14.1.  If the RTC periodic course review team determines the RTC is not meeting the RTC  training  mission  and  ineffectively  delivering  the  Air  Force  standardized  RTC curriculum,  the  RTC  validation  team  will  make  a  recommendation  to  the  owning MAJCOM/A4S to decertify operations at the affected RTC. (T-2) 7.6.14.2.  Recommendation for decertification is based upon: 7.6.14.2.1.  Failure  to  meet  any  critical  item  and  not  rectify  issue  prior  to  RTC periodic course review team departure. 7.6.14.2.2.  Failure to meet 50% of non-critical items. 7.6.14.3.  The  owning  MAJCOM/A4S  and  AFSFC/CC  meet  and  discuss  decertification of  the  RTC.  If  agreement  cannot  be  made  on  an  outcome  of  the  RTC  decertification,  a package is staffed to HAF/A4S for a decision. 7.6.14.4.  RTC  periodic  course  review  team  lead  must  notify  RTC/CC,  MAJCOM/A4S and AFSFC/CC of decertification recommendation. (T-1) 7.6.14.5.  The  owning  MAJCOM/A4S  immediately  notifies  the  RTC  Wing  Commander or equivalent and the AFSFC/CC of decertification. 7.6.14.6.  AFSFC will no longer schedule classes at the decertified location and it is the AFSFC’s responsibility to determine scheduling courses of action for existing and future classes. (T-1) 7.6.14.7.  MAJCOM  and  RTC  collaborate  and  establish  a  recertification  timeline  based upon the observations. Owning MAJCOM provides the recertification timeline to AFSFC within 60 days of decertification. 7.6.15.  Impact Considerations.  AFSFC/CC makes the determination for long term impact of a decertified curriculum or RTC. 7.6.16.  Contracted Functions Validation. 7.6.16.1.  Validation  Areas.  Assess  and  rate  contracted  functions  against  Performance Work Statements (PWS) or Statement of Work (SOW). The PWS or SOW is assessed for adequacy to ensure it meets mission requirements. 7.6.16.2.  Rating and Reporting. Contracted functions will be rated; however, individual contractors  will  not.  Sampling  of  contracted  activity  is  coordinated  through  the  Quality Assurance Evaluator (QAE). Contractors may be provided with applicable portions of the report  IAW  DoD  Regulation  5400.7-R/AFMAN  33-302,  DoD  Freedom  of  Information Act Program. 58 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 7.6.16.3.  Validation. Validate observations related to contractor functions with the QAE and  appropriate  unit  personnel.  NOTE:  Only  the  Contracting  Officer  can  take  formal action against the contractor for noncompliance. 7.6.17.  Validation Report. 7.6.17.1.  Validation  Team  will  complete  a  formal  report  within  30  days  of  validation visit  and  forward  a  copy  to  owning  MAJCOM/A4S  and  AFSFC/CC.  (T-1)    The  report requires approval by both prior to release to the RTC. 7.6.17.2.  Each  Validation  Report AFSFC/FGTR. is  assigned  a  unique tracking  number  by 7.6.17.3.  The  Validation  Report  describes,  in  sufficient  detail,  the  deficiency  and contextual  facts  as  necessary,  to  clearly  convey  deficiencies  requiring  resolution.  The written description alone should be adequate  for the validation party to begin  corrective action  planning.  Final  reports  are  maintained  by  AFSFC/FGTR  and  reviewed  by AETC/A3Q during the annual RTC ADR validation.  GINA M.

TASK(S): (List the task(s) to be evaluated). CONDITION: (The condition associated with the evaluated task).  STANDARD: (The standard associated with the evaluated task).  Evaluator/Unit: (Self-explanatory). Date: (Self-Explanatory). 1. GENERAL CONDITIONS: (Provide a brief description of the scenario). 2. PRIMARY EXERCISE TRAINING AND EVALUATION STANDARDS: (Provide an explanation of the standards to be met in order to achieve a passing grade/rating and how the standards are to be measured. TEEO developers may also provide an explanation of intangible items that may contribute to successful accomplishment of the task or tasks, for example, command and control, communication, tactics, etc). 3. TRAINING EXERCISE AND EVALUATION RESULTS: (Provide instructions for trainers/evaluators/controllers on how to document evaluation results in the space provided on the following pages of this outline to indicate the unit's performance on each task. Trainers/evaluators/exercise controllers should record other important information). 4. SUGGESTED SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS: a. Administration. (Outline instructions for trainers/evaluators/controllers on any administrative functions needed to carry out the exercise/evaluation. Some things to consider are safety and coordination with affected units such as providing exercise start cards and copies of TEEO to the BDOC). b. Minimum evaluators. (Provide a description of the composition of the exercise/evaluation team. The size, makeup and positioning of the team should be adequate to cover all aspects of the exercise/evaluation). c. Opposing forces. (Provide the details for opposing forces. Among things to consider are team composition, equipment, position, and tactics, techniques and procedures to be used). d. Support personnel. (List any support personnel needed and the duties they will perform). e. Exercise area. (Provide a description of the area to be used. The area should be of sufficient size to allow the unit to carry out the task(s) and should also resemble the environment where the team will be performing its mission(s) as much as possible). f. Firing area. None. g. Training aids, devices and special equipment. (List any items needed to support the exercise/evaluation. Some examples are listed below). (1) If available, use approved dye marking cartridges or Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 67 System (MILES) or similar system for both the RF and opposing forces. (2) If available, use light attenuating devices for training in limited visibility situations. (3) In actual night exercises, both response forces and opposing forces personnel should wear night vision devices, if available. (4) Ammunition. Issue the following to both forces: (a) 5.56mm, blank, 60 rounds per M16 series weapon (M16A2/GAU/M4).  (b) 5.56mm, blank, 200 rounds per M249 or M240B machine gun.  (5) Smoke canister (if appropriate). (6) If using MILES, follow the rules in the Air Force Handbooks or in the MILES exercise booklet. (7) Marking cartridges. (8) Key references. AFHs, AFI 31-101 Integrated Defense, and Marking Cartridge CONOPS. 5. CONSIDERATIONS: (List any considerations that will contribute to a safe but successful exercise/evaluation. Some examples are listed below). a. If MILES is not available, one trainer or evaluator should be with opposing forces to allow the trainer or evaluator to see how well the response force uses available cover and concealment, as well as proper fire and maneuver techniques. b. The use of marking cartridges is authorized but is not required. Marking cartridges can add a high degree of realism, but can create a safety risk. If used, strict compliance with the guidance and safety procedures in the CONOPS provided on the AFSFC website will be followed. Safety is critical and must be considered and built into every phase of training. Scenarios will be stopped immediately if any safety violation occurs.  c. Trainers, evaluators and exercise directors must not interfere with the exercise, or by their position, alert either side of the opponent's movements. d. In training, players will serve as controllers or evaluators. Being a player in one exercise and an evaluator in another reinforces tactical training principles. e. Safety procedures must be briefed before the exercise starts. The briefing must include:  (1) Weapons safety-Never play with your weapon, or perform any gestures with your weapon that would cause a safety concern or issue.  The safe use of blanks and marking cartridges, if used.  Briefing should include safe engagement distance and proper use/installation of blank firing adapters, any prohibited engagement areas, the use of protective equipment and do’s and don’ts. (2) Use of Force.  (3) Vehicle safety to include speed limits, local driving hazards, vehicle limitations and handling characteristics, and driving in/around the flight line and aircraft parking areas.  (4) Ground Safety. (5) Any locally unique hazards, state or host nation restrictions. 68 AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 (6) Evaluators and controllers must be able to immediately stop exercises in progress for safety violations.  AFI36-2646  12 JANUARY 2017 69 Attachment 4 CORE TASKS FOR SELECT S-3/FLIGHT DUTY POSITIONS.
