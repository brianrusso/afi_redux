For  AFHPSP  and  FAP  participants,  the  amount  of indebtedness  will  be  the  total  of  tuition,  grant,  stipend,  bonus,  and  educational  expenses received  by  the  participant,  divided  by  the  number  of  days  comprising  the  full  ADSC incurred  at  that  point,  multiplied  by  the  number  of  days  in  the  unfulfilled  ADSC,  plus interest.    For  the  ADHPLRP,  the  amount  of  indebtedness  will  be  equal  to  loan  repayments made  on  behalf  of  the  recipient  divided  by  the  number  of  days  comprising  the  full  ADSC incurred  at  that  point,  multiplied  by  the  number  of  days  in  the  unfulfilled  ADSC,  plus interest.
