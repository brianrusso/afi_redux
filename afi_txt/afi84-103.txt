Introduction.  The  United  States  Air  Force  is  fully  committed  to  the  preservation  of  its history,  heritage  and  traditions.    The  USAF  meets  this  commitment  through  a  well-conceived and carefully managed heritage program. 1.1.1.  A  heritage  activity  is  any  individual  museum,  heritage  center,  airpark,  or  holding where Air Force heritage is preserved and presented.  As such, heritage activities form a core part  of  the  infrastructure  to  recruit,  train  and  sustain  the  force.    They  provide  education, training  and  information  in  the  history,  heritage,  and  culture  of  the  armed  forces  to  both military personnel and the public.  They provide an essential tool in promoting the esprit de corps  required  to  support  the  performance  of  military  units.    As  such,  they  promote  the readiness of the armed forces. 1.1.2.  Air  Force  heritage  provides  a  means  of  engaging  with  the  cumulative  history  of  the USAF.  By recounting events and people through material culture, Air Force heritage enables our  nation’s  military  personnel  and  civilian  population  to  understand  better  the  current problems and concerns.1  Air Force heritage supports operational and technical needs as well as professional development of personnel, promotes the morale of Air Force personnel, and promotes  pride  in  the  Air  Force.    Stewardship  of  historical  data  and  items  fulfills  our statutory  responsibilities,  informs  and  educates  Air  Force  personnel  and  the  public  on  the mission, roles, and functions of the USAF and its contribution to the nation. 1.1.3.  An objective of this commitment is to preserve the history of the USAF in a way that produces benefits of significant value to the Air Force and the Nation.  Thus, the objectives of the USAF Heritage Program are to: 1.1.3.1.  Preserve  and  protect  the  history,  heritage,  and  culture  of  the  USAF,  its commands,  installations,  and  people  through  collections,  displays,  and  exhibits  that capture historic events, technological development, individuals, and materials. 1.1.3.2.  Inspire, motivate, and educate America’s youth towards the USAF and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). 1.1.3.3.  Interpret  and  present  to  the  public  the  USAF’s  history,  heritage,  and  culture  – keeping  its  story  visible,  accessible,  and  alive  –  and  creating  a  better  understanding  on which to base future perceptions and support of USAF programs.                                                  1 Archeologist  Leland Ferguson defines material culture as all "the things that people leave behind....all of the things people make from the physical world--farm tools, ceramics, houses, furniture, toys, buttons, roads, cities."  Noted American Studies scholar, Thomas Schlereth, defines material culture studies as “…the study through artifacts (and other pertinent historical evidence) of belief systems – the values, ideas, attitudes, and assumptions – of a particular community or society, usually across time.  The common assumption underlying material culture research is that objects made or modified by humans, consciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly, reflect the belief patterns of individuals who made, commissioned, purchased, or used, and, by extension, the belief patterns of the larger society of which they are a part.”   AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   7  1.1.3.4.  Provide  a  resource  to  educate  and  train  USAF  members  in  the  historical  and technological  background  of  their  profession.    Motivate  USAF  members  towards increased  pride  in  their  profession  which,  in  turn,  increases  their  professional performance,  career  incentive,  and  retention.    Generate  a  sense  of  pride  in  USAF veterans, who return to see and reflect on their service. 1.2.  The United States Air Force Heritage Program (USAFHP).  The USAFHP is a function of the Air Force History and Museums Program (AFHMP) and comprises the National Museum of  the  United  States  Air  Force  (NMUSAF)  and  Air  Force  field  museums  (AFFMs),  Air  Force heritage  centers  (AFHCs),  Air  Force  historical  holdings  (AFHHs),  and  airparks,  referred  to  as heritage  activities.    The  USAFHP  acquires,  cares  for  and  manages  all  Air  Force  historical property.    It  operates  under  the  policy  and  guidance  of  the  Director,  Air  Force  History  and Museums (AF/HO) located in Washington, D.C. 1.2.1.  The  NMUSAF  is  located  at  Wright-Patterson  AFB,  OH  and  is  assigned  as  a  direct reporting  unit  (DRU)  of  Headquarters  (HQ)  Air  Force  Materiel  Command  (AFMC)  for logistics and administration.  It is delegated by the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to be the service-level authority on the stewardship and accountability of USAFHP property and to provide  the  broadest  interpretation  and  presentation  of  USAF  history  and  heritage.  NMUSAF  is  obligated  to  ensure  that  heritage  activities  are  meeting  stewardship  and accountability  requirements  for  the  historical  property  in  their  custody.    As  such,  it  may periodically  be  required  to  evaluate  heritage  activities  and  advise  supporting  commanders and  Major  Command  History  Offices  (MAJCOM/HOs)  on  the  acceptable  levels  of professional  museum  standards  and  practices.    NMUSAF  provides  USAFHP  leadership opportunities  to  identify  and  intervene  to  correct  potential  problem  areas  before  they negatively impact an artifact. 1.2.2.  Air Force field museums are appropriated fund entities that showcase a specific aspect of Air Force operations or functions.  They are authorized to display artifacts, which includes aerospace vehicles. AFFMs are housed in a building, or part thereof, specifically designated for  the  exclusive  use  of  the  museum.    They  are  open  to  military  and  civilian  visitors  at regularly  scheduled  hours.    AFFMs  are  staffed  by  professional  museum  curators  and specialists who perform curatorial functions, training, education, and related historical duties, full-time (see Figure 1.1, Chapters 3 and 6). 1.2.3.  Air Force heritage centers are appropriated fund entities that showcase the history and missions  performed  at  that  particular  wing,  function,  or  geographic  location.    They  are authorized  to  display  artifacts,  which  includes  aerospace  vehicles.    AFHCs  are  housed  in  a building, or part thereof, specifically designated for the exclusive use of the heritage center.  They  are  open  to  military  and  civilian  visitors  at  regularly  scheduled  hours.    Although professionally  trained  staff  is  recommended,  AFHCs  can  be  managed  by  a  Historical Property Custodian (HPC) and additional staff as determined by the supporting commander.  This  staff  performs  limited  curatorial  functions,  training,  education  and  related  historical duties.    AFHCs  are  typically  smaller  in  scope  and  collection  than  AFFMs  (see  Figure  1.1, Chapters 3 and 6). 1.2.4.  Air  Force  historical  holdings  are  collections  of  historical  property  under  Air  Force control  displayed  in  a  trophy  room,  visitors’  center,  hall  of  fame,  hallway  exhibit,  or  other type  of  display  not  recognized  by  the  Air  Force  as  a  field  museum  or  a  heritage  center.    8  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 AFHHs  are  authorized  to  display  artifacts,  which  includes  aerospace  vehicles,  and  could range in size from a few items in one display case, to hundreds of items displayed throughout a facility (e.g. the USAF Academy).  An HPC oversees the maintenance and accountability of historical property on display (see Figure 1.1, Chapters 3 and 6). 1.2.5.  Airparks display one or more Air Force-related historical aerospace vehicles (aircraft or missile) and related support equipment on an Air Force installation.  Airparks may range in size from a single aerospace vehicle (e.g.  a “gate guard” near an installation entrance gate) to  multiple  vehicles  displayed  together  in  a  designated  area.  An  on-site  HPC  oversees  the accountability  and  maintenance  of  the  aerospace  vehicles  on  display  (see  Figure  1.1, Chapters 3 and 6). Figure 1.1.  Comparison of Heritage Activities 1.3.  USAFHP Board of Directors.  On behalf of the SECAF, the USAFHP Board of Directors (Board) provides strategic policy guidance, operational direction and management control to the USAFHP.    The  Board  shapes,  reflects  and  advocates  the  USAFHP’s  values  and  goals.    Board actions  are  governed  by  a  charter  and  by-laws  voted  upon  and  updated  as  needed  but  at  a minimum biennially.  1.4.  Statutory Authority. 1.4.1.  The  USAFHP  collection  is  part  of  the  National  Historical  Collection  of  the  United States  of  America.    The  preservation  for  public  use  of  historical  objects  of  national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States is governed by Title  16  United  States  Code  (USC),  Sections  (§§)431-433  and  470,  as  amended.  Commanders who acquire, possess or accept historical property obligate the USAF under 16 USC §469-470, et. seq., the National Historic Preservation Act, to preserve and interpret the historical property in the interest of history, the Air Force and the American people. 1.4.2.  The use of civilian volunteers in Air Force heritage activities is governed by 10 USC §1588. 1.4.3.

Use  of  appropriated  funds  for  new construction is governed by AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   23  Chapter 5 RESTRUCTURE OR CLOSURE OF USAFHP ACTIVITIES 5.1.  Rationale.  The restructure or closure of a heritage activity may occur for several reasons, including  natural  disasters,  contingency  operations,  professional  deficiencies,  loss  of  interest and/or  support.    This  includes  temporary  and  permanent  closures  as  well  as  changes  in  the category of a heritage activity. 5.2.  Temporary  Closures.  The  initiating  authority  coordinates  via  written  or  electronic correspondence all temporary closures with the supporting commander, through MAJCOM/HO, NMUSAF,  and  AF/HO.    The  supporting  commander  is  the  final  approving  authority  for  all temporary closures.  Correspondence includes: 5.2.1.  Reason(s) for the temporary closing. 5.2.2.  Estimated time the activity remains closed and projected timeline for final outcome. 5.2.3.  An inventory conducted at time of closure, certified by current staff. 5.2.4.  Location of the historical property, whether it meets the requirements for security and conservation and the HPC responsible for the historical property during the inactive period. 5.3.  Permanent  Closures.  The Air Force considers any closure of more than 180 consecutive calendar  days  to  be  permanent.    All  decisions  regarding  permanent  closure  are  in  consultation with NMUSAF and the MAJCOM/HO. 5.3.1.  The  initiating  authority  coordinates  via  written  or  electronic  correspondence  all permanent closures with the supporting commander, through MAJCOM/HO, NMUSAF, and AF/HO.  Correspondence includes: 5.3.1.1.  Reason(s) for the permanent closing. 5.3.1.2.  Projected timeline for accomplishing all activities related to permanent closing. 5.3.1.3.  Appointment  of  an  HPC  responsible  for  the  control  and  care  of  historical property.    Include  the  HPC’s  contact  information.    The  HPC  receives  disposition instructions and coordinates the shipment of the historical property. 5.3.2.  The  HPC,  in  coordination  with  the  supporting  commander  and  MAJCOM/HO,  will first  close  the  activity  to  the  public.  (T-2).  Once  closed  to  the  public,  the  HPC  will  bring accessioning and cataloging up to date.  (T-1) 5.3.3.  The  HPC,  MAJCOM/HO,  and  NMUSAF  Collection  Management  Division (NMUSAF/MUC)  will  conduct  a  joint  inventory  and  resolve  all  historical  property accountability issues before the supporting commander officially closes the activity.  (T-1) 5.3.4.  The  NMUSAF  will  provide  instructions  for  the  disposition  of  historical  property  on loan  to  the  activity  being  closed.    Heritage  activities  will  not  dispose  of  any  historical property  until  these  instructions  have  been  received.  (T-1).  All  disposition  of  historical property (final accountability, shipping, loans to other organizations) is accomplished prior to the closure of the heritage activity.   24  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 5.3.5.  The  supporting  commander  sponsoring  the  closing  heritage  activity  will  bear  all expenses  for  closure,  including  the  joint  inventory,  packing,  shipping,  transportation,  and temporary duty (TDY) travel.  (T-1) 5.4.  Restructuring  USAFHP  activities.  Supporting  commanders  or  MAJCOM/HOs  may recommend that a heritage activity within the command be restructured in size, scope, mission, staff, or collections, or changed to another category of heritage activity. 5.4.1.  Restructuring  actions  are  coordinated  with  all  interested  parties  (i.e.  MAJCOM/HO, NMUSAF, supporting commander, PO). 5.4.2.  The  supporting  commander,  in  coordination  with  the  MAJCOM/HO,  will  determine the appropriate category of heritage activity and direct the development of a strategic plan as outlined in Attachment  2. (T-1). The plan includes a projected timeline for restructure and completion  of  all  required  actions  and  outlines  the  historical  property  disposition  plan,  if appropriate. 5.4.3.  The  NMUSAF,  in  coordination  with  the  MAJCOM/HO,  provides  instructions  for disposition of historical property made excess by restructuring or for which stewardship can no  longer  be  provided.    Heritage  activities  undergoing  restructure  will  not  dispose  of  any artifacts until these instructions have been received. (T-1). Disposition of historical property (final  accountability,  shipping,  loans  to  other  organizations)  is  accomplished  prior  to  the restructure of the heritage activity. 5.4.4.  The  AFFM  Director  or  HPC  will  bring  accessioning  and  cataloging  up  to  date, provide final  inventory  list to MAJCOM/HO, and work with  NMUSAF to resolve property accountability issues. (T-1) 5.4.5.  The AFFM Director or HPC, MAJCOM/HO and NMUSAF must conduct a final joint inventory before a heritage activity is officially restructured.  (T-1) 5.4.6.  The supporting commander sponsoring the heritage activity’s restructure appoints, in writing, an HPC to be responsible for all historical property.  This HPC receives disposition instructions  and  coordinates  the  shipment  of  the  historical  property.    The  supporting commander  will  furnish  the  MAJCOM/HO  and  NMUSAF/MUC  with  the  HPC's  contact information.  (T-1) 5.4.7.  The  supporting  commander  sponsoring  the  heritage  activity’s  restructure  bears  all expenses  including  but  not  limited  to  the  joint  inventory,  packing,  shipping,  transportation, and  all  associated  TDY  travel.    See  paragraph  6.13  for  guidance  on  costs  associated  with relocating aerospace vehicles. 5.5.  Upgrading  a  Heritage  Activity.  Upgrading  an  existing  heritage  activity  conveys  on current  and  future  commanders  an  ongoing  responsibility  for  additional  resources  and  support.  Consider  this  responsibility  in  any  application  for  such  an  upgrade.  Requests  for  upgrade  are treated as an application to establish a new heritage activity and the administrative process is the same.  See Chapter 2 for application requirements. 5.6.  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC). 5.6.1.  NMUSAF  manages  disposition  and  reutilization  of  USAF  historical  property  at BRAC  sites.   The  NMUSAF  must  approve,  after  coordination  with  associated MAJCOM/HO, any traded, transferred, loaned, or donated historical property at BRAC sites, AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   25  as they are not to be considered the personal property of the sponsoring installation, base, or unit, or any individual or private group. 5.6.2.  Disposition of historical property. 5.6.2.1.  The  NMUSAF  Director  has  authority  to  identify  any  historical  property, including  aerospace  vehicles,  and  direct  its  disposition  in  coordination  with  the installation's  drawdown  plans  and  funding.  Priority  is  given  to  requirements  of  the USAFHP. 5.6.2.2.  Second  priority  is  given  to  requests  for  historical  property  from  other  services (Army,  Navy,  Marine  Corps,  Coast  Guard)  or  other  federal  organizations  or  agencies (National Park Service, National Archives, etc.). in  DoD  4165.66-M,  Base 5.6.2.3.  In  accordance  with  procedures  established Development and Realignment Manual, the USAFHP is exempt from rules pertaining to personal  property.    Only  after  determination  by  the  NMUSAF  will  USAF  historical property from BRAC sites be made available to the local community to support civilian heritage  activities  and  initiatives.    Such  activities  are  qualified  in  accordance  with  10 USC  §2572  and  undergo  formal  certification  with  NMUSAF  prior  to  receiving  any historical property (see Chapter 12). 5.6.3.  Disposition planning. 5.6.3.1.  NMUSAF/MUC  is  the  focal  point  for  disposition  planning.    NMUSAF/MUC will  work  with  the  appropriate  HPC  and  MAJCOM/HO  and  Air  Force  Real  Property Agency point of contact to develop disposition plans and lists for historical property, and distribute to relevant organizations. 5.6.3.2.  Upon final  determination of a closure action, all historical  property  accounts at that site are frozen.  No additional historical property is placed on loan at the location, nor is  historical  property  relocated  or  disposed  of  until  a  written  disposition  plan  has  been developed and approved by the NMUSAF. 5.6.4.  Actions. 5.6.4.1.  The  supporting  commander  appoints,  in  writing,  an  HPC  to  be  responsible  for the  historical  property  remaining  on-site,  to  receive  disposition  instructions  and coordinate  the  shipment  of  historical  property.    The  commander  will  furnish  the MAJCOM/HO and NMUSAF/MUC with the HPC’s contact information.  (T-1) 5.6.4.2.  MAJCOM/HO  will  identify  any  items  of  unreported  or  unidentified  historical property and report findings to NMUSAF/MUC.  NMUSAF will determine if any of the items will be accessioned as USAF historical property and take the required actions. 5.6.4.3.  The HPC will bring accessioning and cataloging up to date.  (T-1) 5.6.4.4.  The  HPC,  MAJCOM/HO,  and  NMUSAF  will  conduct  a  joint  inventory  and resolve all property accountability issues.  (T-1) 5.6.4.5.  NMUSAF/MUC  will  identify  all  property  to  be  returned  to  meet  NMUSAF requirements.   26  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 5.6.4.6.  MAJCOM/HO  will  execute  the  disposition  plan.    NMUSAF  coordinates  the relocation of aerospace vehicles. 5.6.4.7.  MAJCOM/HO  may  identify  from  the  remaining  property  items  required  for redistribution within their own MAJCOM. 5.6.4.8.  The  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center,  Installations  Directorate  (AFCEC/CI),  in coordination with MAJCOM/HO, NMUSAF, and the local redevelopment authority, will identify  and  prioritize  items  of  interest  to  civilian  organizations  which  may  be  made available  after  all  other  requirements  are  satisfied.  (T-1).  The  Air  Force  Real  Property Agency  will  distribute  information  about  USAF  civilian  loan  programs  (see  paragraph 5.6.2.3 and Chapter 12). (T-1). 5.6.5.  Funding.    The  MAJCOM  to  which  the  BRAC  site  belongs  bears  all  expenses  for closure  actions including  preparation  (e.g.  demilitarization,  engine  removal,  bio-environmental  remediation,  safety  and  egress  certification)  of  aerospace  vehicles  to  be joint conveyed inventory,  packing,  shipping,  and transportation of historical property, and TDY travel. to  other  heritage  activities, the AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   27  Chapter 6 MANAGING USAFHP PROPERTY 6.1.  Scope.  A  commander  who  maintains  a  heritage  activity  acquires  an  obligation  under  the law  (16  USC  §433-435,  469,  470  et  seq.)  to  preserve  and  interpret  those  collections  in  the interest  of  history,  the  Air  Force,  and  the  American  people.    Doing  so  preserves  the  material culture  of  the  Air  Force  and  enhances  the  educational  and  operational  value  of  USAFHP activities.  USAFHP property requires a life cycle of care from initial evaluation, to acquisition and custody, through disposition.  Thus all acquisitions obligate not only the current commander but future commanders as well. 6.1.1.  Initial  evaluation  is  determining  whether  historical  property  meets  an  activity’s strategic plan. 6.1.2.  Acquisition  is  limited  to  items  that  are  used  for  display  or  for  broader  USAFHP collection needs. 6.1.3.  Custody  entails  the  accountability,  stewardship,  care  and  preservation  of  historical property. 6.1.4.  Disposition is accomplished within the limits of this AFI. 6.2.  Categories  of USAFHP  Property.  There are seven categories of USAFHP property.  All items accepted into the USAFHP are placed into one of these property categories at the time of acquisition  and  accounted  for  in  accordance  with  specific  requirements.    Accountability, custodial, and administrative responsibilities vary according to category. 6.2.1.  Historical Property. 6.2.1.1.  The  historical  property  category  constitutes  the  most  significant  portion  of  the USAFHP collection. Generally, historical property determinations are based on an item’s association  with  a  person,  event  or  place;  its  traditional  association  with  an  Air  Force organization;  its  significance  as  a  representative  example  of  military  equipment;  or because  it  represents  a  significant  technological  contribution  to  military  science  or equipment.    Items  considered  for  the  historical  property  category  should  be  carefully evaluated against one or more of the above criteria. 6.2.1.2.  NMUSAF  may  also  designate  certain  objects  in  the  USAFHP  collection  from any of the categories as being especially significant and requiring special considerations of  conservation,  security,  storage  or  exhibit.    Once  so  designated,  the  object  becomes historical property. 6.2.1.3.  Control  and  accountability  of  historical  property  is  maintained  centrally  by  the NMUSAF and made available to field heritage activities by loan. 6.2.1.4.  Heritage  activities  may  consult  the  NMUSAF’s  Data  Dictionary  for  specific examples of historical property. 6.2.1.5.  For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  historical  property  does  not  include  real property  of  historical  interest  (e.g.,  archaeological  sites,  cemeteries,  monuments, memorials, and buildings).   28  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 6.2.2.  Historical  Reference  Material.    Items  in  this  category  are  often,  but  not  exclusively, paper based and include photographic and printed material used for support of exhibits and educational  programming in heritage activities (e.g. diaries, scrapbooks,  loose photographs, technical  manuals).    Historical  reference  material  may  also  include  film,  negatives, audio/visual material as well as electronic resources such as compact discs (CDs) and digital versatile discs (DVDs).  Items in this category are accounted for locally through inventories and  finding  aids  to  provide  a  means  for  assuring  individual  object  accountability  and identification.  Local inventories and finding aids should utilize a numbering system distinct from  that used to  accession  historical  property.   Apply numbers in  soft pencil to  individual reference material items and affix permanent numbers to folders or containers.  Provide copy of local inventories and finding aids to MAJCOM/HO.  However, not all paper based items are  historical  reference  material.    Some,  based  on  their  significance,  are  historical  property and  are  accessioned  as  such  (see  paragraph  6.2.1.1).    These  items  include  currency (including  “short  snorters”),  autographed items  of  potential  historical  significance, propaganda leaflets, significant cultural or religious documents, pilot identification cards and log books. Items such as diaries or scrapbooks could be either historical reference material or historical property depending on their significance. 6.2.3.  Heraldic Property. 6.2.3.1.  Includes  the  organizational  flags  of  color-bearing  establishments  in  accordance with  AFI  84-105,  Organizational  Lineage,  Honors  and  Heraldry.    Title  to  colors, standards,  and  guidons  of  demobilized  organizations  of  the  Air  Force  remains  in  the United  States  (10  USC  §9565(b).    Such  flags,  guidons  and  related  streamers  are inherently  historical  and,  upon  retirement,  are  sent  to  NMUSAF/MUC  for  conservation and storage.  Duplicate sets need not be retained. 6.2.3.2.  For  Air  National  Guard  heraldic  property,  10  USC  §9565  provides  that  the Governor of the State may request the return and retention of retired unit colors, flags and guidons.    Returned  items  are  preserved  and  displayed  in  accordance  with  professional standards and published practice (see Chapter  7) and are to be accounted for as federal property.    The  Governor  (Adjutant  General)  may  determine  the  accountability  method, such as an active loan account with NMUSAF/MUC as per this instruction, or held in a Guard museum federal historical property account under Army Regulation (AR) 870-20 and United States Property and Fiscal Office (USPFO) oversight. 6.2.4.  Restoration Support Items (RSI).   Items in this category are strictly limited to aircraft parts  and  alternate  mission  equipment  (missile  rails,  pylons,  canopies,  etc.)  needed  for aerospace vehicle restoration as identified in the heritage activity’s strategic plan.  RSI does not  include  bench  stock  (i.e.  rivets,  screws,  nuts,  bolts,  safety  wire,  screen  material).    RSI material  is  accounted  for  locally  but  heritage  activities  must  maintain  accurate  inventories and  finding  aids  to  provide  a  means  for  assuring  individual  object  accountability  and identification. (T-1). Use a numbering system distinct from that used to accession historical property  (see  paragraph  6.14).    Provide  copy  of  local  inventories  and  finding  aids  to MAJCOM/HO.   Heritage activities will screen all RSI for radioactive material (See Chapter 9). (T-1) 6.2.5.  Museum  Support  Articles  (MSA).    This  category  includes  generic  apparel  and insignia,  reproductions,  and  models  that  may  be  used  in  cases  or  dioramas  and  are  not AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   29  accessioned historical artifacts. They may, however, be items of significant monetary value. Retain  receipts  for  any  items  purchased  to  denote  source  of  acquisition  and  to  distinguish from  historical  property.    Account  for  MSA  through  local  inventories  and  finding  aids  to provide  a  means  for  assuring  individual  object  accountability  and  identification.    Use  a numbering system distinct from that used to accession historical property.  Heritage activities will provide copy of local inventories and finding aids to MAJCOM/HO.  (T-2) 6.2.6.  Educational Support Items (ESI). This category includes generic apparel, insignia and hardware  items  used  in  educational  programs.    No  weapons  or  radioactive  items  may  be included in this category.  Items may be designated ESI in one of two ways:  1) at the time of initial acquisition or 2) via deaccession and re-categorization of existing historical property. 6.2.6.1.  Initial acquisitions of ESI.  Heritage activities are authorized to accept donations within the guidelines of AFI 51-601, or make purchases or transfers specifically for use as ESI. 6.2.6.1.1.  Document all donations of ESI by annotating the original, signed AF Form 3571, USAF Heritage Program Proffer of Gift Agreement, to reflect that the item(s) donated are utilized as ESI.  Heritage activities will ensure the donor is aware of and understands the intended use of items as ESI. (T-1) 6.2.6.1.2.  Document  all  purchases  of  ESI  with  the  original  receipt  attached  to  a memorandum signed by director or curator detailing intended use.  Heritage activities will retain documentation for as long as the item is in the ESI collection.  (T-1) 6.2.6.1.3.  Document all transfers of ESI with a memorandum signed by the director or curator detailing intended use.  Heritage activities will attach signed memorandum to any paperwork associated with the transfers of ESI (e.g. Defense Department (DD) Form  1149,  Requisition  and  Invoice/Shipping  Document,  and  DD  Form  1348-1A, Issue Release/Receipt Document). (T-1) 6.2.6.2.  ESI  from  existing  historical  property.    Items  already  accessioned  as  historical property  may  be  re-designated  as  ESI.    Once  identified,  the  HPC  recommends  to  the MAJCOM/HO that the historical property be deaccessioned to the ESI collection. 6.2.6.2.1.  The HPC will send an image, a one-paragraph justification statement and a copy of the original AF Form 3582,  USAF Heritage Program Accession Worksheet, to the MAJCOM/HO for review.  (T-2) 6.2.6.2.2.  The MAJCOM/HO forwards the application, supporting information, and a recommendation  to  NMUSAF/MUC  within  30  days  of  receipt  from  the  heritage activity’s HPC.   If the recommendation is  approved, NMUSAF/MUC will complete deaccessioning  procedures  and  notify  the  MAJCOM/HO  of  the  object’s  change  in status within 45 days of receipt. 6.2.6.3.  Account  for  ESI  through  local  inventories  and  finding  aids  using  a  numbering system  distinct  from  that  used  to  accession  historical  property.    Items  are  permanently marked  with  a  local  ESI  accountability  number.    The  HPC  will  provide  copy  of  local inventories and finding aids to MAJCOM/HO. (T-2) 6.2.6.4.  ESI  is  only  disposed  of  through  Defense  Logistics  Agency  (DLA)  Disposition Services.  ESI cannot be donated, sold, exchanged, or otherwise disposed of.  If the items   30  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 were formerly historical property, the HPC will maintain all disposition paperwork in the item’s  original  accession  file.  (T-1).  The  HPC  will  retain  disposal  paperwork  for  ESI purchased, donated, or transferred. (T-1) 6.2.6.5.  HPCs will ensure that appropriate sanitation and health safeguards are in place if educational support apparel items are to be used by museum visitors (e.g. “please touch” items or flight helmet/uniform demonstrations as a part of education programs).  (T-1) 6.2.7.  Unit memorabilia.  NMUSAF provides security and long-term storage for significant retired  memorabilia.    This  category  includes  emblems,  insignia,  patches,  trophies,  plaques, awards, and other small mementos of significance to a specific unit or establishment. It does not  include  historical  property  as  addressed  in  paragraph  6.2.1.    Memorabilia  may  also include  photographs  (with  captions,  names,  dates  and  other  identification)  of  significant events, equipment, facilities, commanders, mascots and so on. 6.2.7.1.  An inactivating organization forwards items in one box, sized appropriately, not to  exceed  measurements  of  43”x  31¾”  x  20½”  and  weighing  no  more  than  75  pounds when  full.    Include  an  inventory  of  all  items  in  the  box  and  forward  a  copy  to MAJCOM/HO.    (The  inactivating  organization  will  be  responsible  for  shipping charges.)  (T-3).  The  box  may  be  constructed  in-house  of  any  material  (wood,  metal, plastic,  triple  wall  cardboard)  but  is  stackable  and  has  a  minimum  load  capacity  of  75 pounds.    If  purchasing,  refer  to  General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  supply  catalog for examples, (www.gsaglobalsupply.gsa.gov) to review products or request a catalog. 6.2.7.2.  Consult  NMUSAF/MUC  with  questions  regarding  sending  smaller  amounts where  a  box  is  not  appropriate,  materials  for  retention  and  for  correct  shipping  address (See Attachment 6). 6.2.7.3.  The  organization  will  send  a  request  through  MAJCOM/HO,  including  a  fund cite, to NMUSAF/MUC for return of the items, upon reactivation or transfer of its lineage to another organization. (T-2). 6.3.  Acquiring  Historical  Property.  Acquisition  of  historical  property  into  the  USAFHP  is accomplished  via  donations,  purchase,  exchange,  incoming  loans  and  transfers.  Acquiring historical property by any means is contingent on meeting all of the following criteria: 6.3.1.  Items are identified for an exhibit or purpose as outlined in an approved strategic plan. 6.3.2.  Acquisition request  has been approved by MAJCOM/HO.  DRUs  and FOAs  contact NMUSAF/MUC directly. 6.3.3.  Heritage activity has contacted NMUSAF/MUC to determine availability of requested historical property already in the collection for loan. 6.4.  Requesting  Existing  Historical  Property  from  NMUSAF.  The NMUSAF is  the central repository for historical  property  and loans items to  heritage activities.  Such loans  allow for a broader  exhibition  of  historical  resources.    The  heritage  activity  will  ensure  requests  for historical property reflect their current strategic plan. (T-2). 6.4.1.  HPCs  submit  requests  for  loans  of  historical  property  via  written  or  electronic correspondence  through  the  MAJCOM/HO  to  NMUSAF/MUC.    DRUs  and  FOAs  submit requests directly to NMUSAF.  The following is included: AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   31  6.4.1.1.  A name and/or description of the item(s) requested. 6.4.1.2.  A justification based on the heritage activity's scope of collection statement. 6.4.1.3.  A  statement  acknowledging  that  the  heritage  activity  will  fund  the  loaned historical property’s transport, display and long term maintenance and upkeep. (T-1). 6.4.1.4.  A  description  and  details  about  the  planned  manner  of  display  to  include exhibition plan, restoration or maintenance needs and security. 6.4.2.  NMUSAF/MUC  reviews  requests,  determines  approval  of  the  loan,  and  notifies  the requestor through the MAJCOM/HO or equivalent. 6.4.3.  For new loan accounts, the supporting commander signs the initial HPA and returns a copy through MAJCOM/HO to NMUSAF/MUC.  (See Chapter 2 to establish a new heritage activity.) 6.4.4.  NMUSAF/MUC  ships  the  approved  items  with  a  DD  Form  1149,  Requisition  and Invoice/Shipping  Document.    When  the  shipment  arrives,  the  gaining  organization’s  HPC will physically inventory all items and signs and returns one copy of the DD Form 1149.  (T-1) 6.4.5.  Historical  property  requested  from  NMUSAF  is  loaned  to  heritage  activities  for display purposes only and should be on exhibit within six months of receipt. 6.5.  Requesting Aerospace Vehicles. 6.5.1.  Requests for  aerospace  vehicles  are  submitted  via  written  or  electronic correspondence,  signed  by    the  supporting  commander  and  coordinated  through  the MAJCOM/HO to NMUSAF/MUC.  DRUs and FOAs submit requests directly to NMUSAF.  The following is included: 6.5.1.1.  The aerospace vehicle’s mission, design and series (M/D/S), including the serial number (if applicable), of the particular airframe. 6.5.1.2.  If  applicable,  the  unit  to  which  the  airframe  is/was  assigned  and  years  of assignment. 6.5.1.3.  A  justification  based  on  the  activity's  scope  of  collection  statement  and  how requested aerospace vehicle relates to the approved strategic plan. 6.5.1.4.  An  analysis  of  both  initial  and  long-term  costs  associated  with  acquiring  and caring  for  the  vehicle.  This  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  rough  order  of  magnitude (ROM)  costs  associated  with  taking  on  the  loan  of  aircraft  (safeing,  engine  removal, disassembly,  movement,  re-assembly,  exhibit  needs  [pad,  blocks,  plinths,  etc.],  initial maintenance,  demilitarization),  ongoing  maintenance  (painting,  washing,  landscaping), and the vehicle’s long-term maintenance (20+ years). 6.5.1.5.  A  description  and  details  about  the  planned  manner  of  display  including  a timeline of actions to prepare and place the aerospace vehicle on display. 6.5.2.  The  MAJCOM/HO  forwards  the  request  package  to  NMUSAF/MUC  with  its recommendation.    If  approved,  NMUSAF/MUC  adds  it  to  the  master  aerospace  vehicle request  list  and  notifies  the  heritage  activity  of  its  status.    NMUSAF/MUC  maintains  the master  request  list  by  M/D/S  showing  the  requesting  heritage  activity  and  date  of  request.     32  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 Depending  on  availability  of  the  requested  aerospace  vehicle,  the  amount  of  time  between initial request and delivery can be substantial. NMUSAF/MUC solicits updates to the master request list from MAJCOM/HOs and reviews periodically. 6.5.3.  When  placing  aerospace  vehicles  on  loan  to  heritage  activities,  NMUSAF  first considers  factors  such  as  historical  significance,  mission  scope  and  size  of  the  requesting heritage  activity’s  current  collection.    Other  factors  considered  include  indoor  display capability, condition, rarity and/or composition of the vehicle, and the basic stewardship and condition  of  any  vehicles  already  on  loan  to  the  requesting  activity.    NMUSAF  will  deny requests  if  basic  stewardship  and  condition  requirements  mandated  by  the  HPA  and attachments  are  not  being  met  for  existing  loaned  aerospace  vehicles.    This  includes  but  is not  limited  to  overall  maintenance  and  appearance,  display  site  appearance  and  upkeep, accountability records and inventory and reporting history. 6.5.4.  Losing  Organization  Preference  (LOP).    Requests  for  aerospace  vehicles  currently serving  with  the  requesting  organization  receive  priority.    Consideration  is  also  given  to organizations  who  request  retired  aerospace  vehicles  previously  assigned that organization, provided the requesting organization submits documentation (by serial number) of previous ownership. to 6.5.5.  NMUSAF/MUC coordinates the delivery of aerospace vehicle(s) with the losing and gaining  heritage  activities  and  prepares  the  required  accountability  documents.    Aerospace vehicles are loaned for display purposes only and should be on exhibit within six months of receipt. 6.5.6.  Heritage activities will forward all original aircraft operational records (AFTO Forms 781  series,  Arms  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data  Document,  AFTO  Form  95,  Significant Historical Data) to NMUSAF/MUC upon delivery of the aerospace vehicle. (T-1). Activities that wish to retain operational records must request a waiver from MUC. (T-1) 6.5.7.  Only  NMUSAF  has  the  authority  to  directly  contact  Excess  Aircraft  Disposition (AF/A8PB)  and AFMC  System Program Offices (SPOs) on the availability  and disposition of  excess  aerospace  vehicles.    In  accordance  with  AFI  16-402,  Aerospace  Vehicle Programming,  Assignment,  Distribution,  Accounting,  and  Termination,  AF/A8PB  may reallocate  aerospace  vehicles  to  the  USAFHP  that  exceed  the  Air  Force  operational inventory, Ground Instructional Training Asset (GITA), or other requirements. 6.6.  Donations.  Donations accepted into the USAFHP are done so in accordance with AFI 51-601, Gifts to the Department of the Air Force and this instruction. Supporting commanders may designate in  writing a subordinate authority, such as a HPC, to  sign or act  in  the commander’s name within the limits established by the commander and AFI 51-601.   All donations are made to the USAF, not to a specific heritage activity.   The commander or the commander's designated subordinate authority will sign AF Form 3571, USAF Museum System Proffer of Gift Agreement, when processing all donations, regardless of property category. (T-1) 6.6.1.  All  donations  should  fit  the  heritage  activity’s  scope  of  collection  and  strategic  plan and  have  prior,  written  approval  from  MAJCOM/HO  in  coordination  with  NMUSAF  (see paragraph 6.3).  DRU and FOA leadership will determine the level of approval within their organization. (T-1). Heritage activities will forward a list and digital images of all items to be considered for donation, within 7 days, to MAJCOM/HOs for coordination with NMUSAF. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   33  (T-1).  When  considering  a  donation,  if  not  immediately  declined  due  to  scope,  condition, relevant  provenance, etc., heritage activities will issue a temporary receipt (AF Form 1297, Temporary Issue Receipt) to the donor, to maintain accountability during the interim period, pending  MAJCOM/HO  approval.  (T-1).  Inform  donor  that  the  potential  donation  first undergoes  approval  before  formal  acceptance.    Do  not  accept  donations  that  come  with limiting conditions or high maintenance costs.  Heritage activities will not accept donations that  incur  some  explicit  or  implicit  responsibility  (for  example,  an  agreement  to  display  or exhibit, or to retain at one specific location).  (T-1) 6.6.2.  Acknowledge  all  approved  donations  in  writing.    Keep  the  signed  original  AF  Form 3571  in  the  item's  accession  folder.    Heritage  activities  will  provide  the  donor  a  copy  and forwards a copy to NMUSAF/MUC. (T-1) 6.6.3.  AFI 51-601 and professional museum ethics prohibit heritage activities from assigning a  value  to  a  donation  for  donor  tax  purposes.    Activities  may,  however,  assign  a  monetary value  to  the  item  to  determine  the  proper  level  of  authority  required  for  acceptance  in accordance with AFI 51-601 and to determine the level of security required (see Chapter 8).  These values are for internal purposes only, and not to be used by donors for tax purposes. 6.6.4.  Heritage  activities  must  refuse  donations  that  fall  outside  its  scope  of  collection  and mission  statement  or  are  not  relevant  to  its  current  strategic  plan.  (T-1).  However,  if  items offered  are of obvious  military historical significance, refer donors of such materials  to  the MAJCOM/HO or to the NMUSAF Senior Curator. 6.6.5.  After acceptance at any level, title to historical property passes to the USAFHP. 6.6.6.  The  Air  Force  does  not  authorize  acquisition  of  historical  property  by  an  individual acting  as  a  surrogate  or  the  operation  of  a  separate  holding  account  for  historical  property.  However, a heritage activity’s PO is authorized to acquire historical property for the activity in  accordance  with  AFI  34-223  and  this  instruction  and  donate  as  appropriate  (see paragraph 10.2.5.2). 6.6.7.  Heritage  activities  PO  will  process  gifts  of  personal  papers  or  other  historical documents not related to exhibits according to AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services and Requirements. (T-1) 6.6.8.  MAJCOM/HOs  will  notify  NMUSAF/MUC  when  significant  artifacts  are  received within their commands (see paragraph 8.1.4). 6.7.  Additional  Sources.  After coordination with MAJCOM/HO or DRU/FOA leadership and approval by NMUSAF/MUC, heritage activities may also acquire historical property through the following channels.  Such acquisitions reflect the activity’s current strategic plan. 6.7.1.  Transfers.  According to this instruction and AFMAN 23-110, USAF Supply Manual, heritage  activities  may  transfer  items  on  organizational  equipment  accounts  (Custodian Authorization/Custody Receipt Listing, CA/CRL) to the USAFHP as historical property for display  purposes  at  no  cost.    The  requesting  activity  sends  a  DD  Form  1348-1A,  Issue Release/Receive  Document,  or  a  DD  Form  1149,  Requisition  and  Invoice/Shipping Document,  with  the  National  Stock  Number  (NSN),  nomenclature,  other  identifying information and the organization's point of contact to NMUSAF/MUC.   34  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 6.7.1.1.  Some transfers may require the use of a Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DODAAC).  This is a six position code that uniquely identifies a unit, activity, or organization  that  has  the  authority  to  requisition  and/or  receive  material.    All  heritage activities except NMUSAF use the DODAAC assigned to their parent organization in all   NMUSAF  maintains  its  own  DODAAC.  Contact supply  system  transactions. MAJCOM/HO at https://dodaac.wpafb.af.mil/. appropriate  DODAAC  or for see  DODAAC  website 6.7.1.2.  For programs with Program Protection (PPP), obtain written confirmation from the  Program  Manager  that  the  platform  or  item  being  accepted  into  the  NMUSAF inventory  does  not  (or  no  longer)  contains  critical  program  information  and  critical components.  Reference  DoDI  5200.39,  Critical  Program  Information  (CPI)  Protection within  the  Department  of  Defense,  DoDI  5200.44:    Protection  of  Mission  Critical Functions  to  Achieve  Trusted  Systems  and  Networks  (TSN),  and  AFPAM  63-113, Program Protection Planning for Life Cycle Management, for more information. 6.7.2.  Incoming Loans.  Incoming loans are defined as non-USAFHP property accepted for loan from individuals or organizations other than NMUSAF.  Acceptance of incoming loans obligates  the  U.S.  Air  Force  to  private  individuals,  groups  or  other  government  agencies. Accepting/displaying artifacts on incoming loan without proper documentation is prohibited as it can expose the Air Force to potential legal action concerning their loss or damage. Such loans should only be considered under extraordinary circumstances for specialized short-term exhibit  purposes.  MAJCOM/HO  or  DRU/FOA  leadership  must  approve  incoming  loans  in writing  prior  to  acceptance/receipt.  (T-1).  Normally,  incoming  loans  may  be  for  no  longer than one year.  MAJCOM/HO must re-approve those extending beyond one year. 6.7.2.1.  Use  AF  Form  3572,  USAF  Heritage  Program  Loan  Agreement,  to  document incoming loans.  This  form may be locally reproduced.  Heritage activities will provide the lender with a copy of the form. (T-1) 6.7.3.  Withdrawals  from  DLA  Disposition  Services.    In  accordance  with  a  HQ  Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service moratorium message 021321Z October 1995 regarding issues  to  all  military  service  museums,  all  USAFHP,  including  NMUSAF,  are  prohibited from  withdrawing  items  from  DLA  Disposition  Services.  The  only  exceptions  to  this moratorium are for items in a limited number of stock classes relating to housekeeping and facility maintenance. See https://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil for more information. 6.8.  Loan  Conditions.  The NMUSAF Director controls, allocates and distributes all historical property.  Heritage activities request and utilize loaned historical property to support exhibits or displays  as  per  an  approved  exhibit  plan.    All  loaned  property  is  used  in  a  careful  and  prudent manner.  In taking on the loan of aerospace vehicles, heritage activities agree to perform routine maintenance  including  (but  not  limited  to)  annual  upkeep,  periodic  painting,  repair  of  damage, and day-to-day care, so as to ensure the vehicle(s) reflects credit on the USAF.  NMUSAF must approve in advance any modifications which would alter the original form, design, or historical significance of any loaned historical property. All historical property is displayed and protected in accordance with this Instruction, the HPA and its attachments. 6.8.1.  Except where noted at paragraph 6.8.6, historical property cannot be loaned to support non-museum events.  These include social occasions, parades, reenactments, retirements and AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   35  change of command ceremonies.  Heritage activities will not use historical property merely to decorate or furnish offices, clubs, recreation centers or similar facilities.  (T-1) 6.8.2.  Access to loaned aerospace vehicles. 6.8.2.1.  Do not use aerospace vehicles in a consumptive manner.  Aerospace vehicles are to  be  used  for  static  display  purposes  only.      Access  to  their  interiors  (cockpit,  cargo areas, etc.) for purposes other than maintenance or restoration work by persons other than staff  or  authorized  maintenance  personnel  is  typically  prohibited  for  reasons  of  aircraft preservation and public safety. 6.8.2.2.  MAJCOM/HO or DRU/FOA leadership and NMUSAF must approve in writing requests for one time internal access to loaned aerospace vehicles (e.g. veterans or their family members, legitimate commercial media outlets); these requests are to be arranged in advance and considered on a case by case basis. (T-1). Heritage activities that receive such  requests  should  first  consult  aerospace  vehicles  records  and  determine  if  any radioactive  or  other  hazardous  material  is  present  in  or  on  the  vehicle.    If  present,  the request  is  not  approved  without  further  coordination  with  installation  radiation  safety officer  (RSO),  and/or  bioenvironmental  engineering  office,  MAJCOM/HO  and NMUSAF.    If  such  material  is  not  present  the  request  for  internal  access  may  be approved after coordination with MAJCOM/HO and NMUSAF.  Heritage activities must provide  appropriate  personnel  and  equipment  to  ensure  safety  and  security  of  anyone accessing aerospace vehicles. (T-1). Heritage activities will maintain written approvals in aerospace vehicle files.  (T-1) 6.8.2.3.  Requests for a waiver to accommodate regular or permanent public viewing and or  access  to  aerospace  vehicles’  interior  may  be  granted  on  a  case  by  case  basis  by NMUSAF.      Heritage  activities  must  submit  waiver  requests  in  advance  to  NMUSAF consisting  of  a  detailed  plan  showing  proposed  controlled  public  entry  and  addressing potential  visitor  safety  and  security  issues.  (T-1).  Waiver  requests  are  coordinated  with MAJCOM/HO  and  then  submitted  to  NMUSAF  for  review  and  approval  by  its Collections Committee.  Approved waivers are valid for four years and then are renewed.  Written approvals should be retained in aerospace vehicle files. 6.8.3.  Personal  or  casual  photography  or  video  taping  of  historical  property  by  visitors  to heritage activities is authorized. Local media requests are handled through base, installation, or  organization’s  Public  Affairs  Offices.    Specific  guidance  can  be  addressed  to  NMUSAF Public Affairs Division (NMUSAF/MUP).  NMUSAF/MUP is the appropriate media release authority  for  USAFHP  property.    As  such  the  use  of  historical  property  in  any  manner  for commercial  (non-Government)  still  photography,  motion  picture,  television  or  video production  is  prohibited  without  prior  written  approval.    Requests  for  approvals  are submitted  ahead  of  time  in  writing  to  NMUSAF/MUP.  If  granted,  heritage  activities coordinate  approved  requests  through  their  appropriate  Public  Affairs  Office  and  notify MAJCOM/HO. 6.8.4.  When  it  complies  with  U.S.  law  and  DoD  Directives  and  serves  the  interest  of  the USAFHP, the Air Force, or the Government, the NMUSAF may budget and pay for moving historical  aerospace  vehicles  or  other  historical  property  for  display  or  storage.    (Example:  an aircraft that cannot be moved to and displayed at the NMUSAF because of size, runway length,  condition  or logistical  considerations.   The NMUSAF  may have  it flown to  another   36  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 museum  at  its  expense  for  display  rather  than  losing  it  from  the  National  Historical Collection.) 6.8.5.  The  borrowing  organization  will  obtain  and  comply  with  disposition  guidance  from the NMUSAF for all loaned property on termination. (T-1) 6.8.6.  While  not  encouraged,  NMUSAF  loaned  aerospace  vehicles  may  be  temporarily relocated on base under the following conditions: 6.8.6.1.  MAJCOM/HO approval has been obtained, including schedule of movement and return. 6.8.6.2.  The  aerospace  vehicle  does  not  require  disassembly  or  extensive  removal  from permanent mounts. 6.8.6.3.  Tires, wheels, bearings and struts are serviceable. 6.8.6.4.  Appropriate TO-2 procedures are followed and appropriate, serviceable tow bars and tugs are used.  Affirm that qualified personnel perform aerospace vehicle movement and be present at the event. 6.8.6.5.  Loaned aerospace vehicles may be towed across improved surfaces only. 6.8.6.6.  Any temporary re-location of loaned aerospace vehicles is to a site on the active installation (off-base requests are not authorized). 6.8.7.  Only the NMUSAF may loan historical property to Air Force, DoD and other Federal organizations,  foreign  governmental  or  military  museums  for  static  display  purposes. Heritage activities are prohibited from making third-party loans of historical property.  Only the  NMUSAF  will  loan  historical  property  for  static  display  purposes  to  domestic  civilian, non-Federal,  nonprofit,  educational  museums,  cities,  counties  or  municipalities  or  veterans’ organizations  that  meet  the  requirements  of  10  USC  §2572  and  DoD  4160.21-M,  Defense Materiel Disposition Manual (see Chapter 12). 6.8.8.  Recall  of  historical  property.    The  NMUSAF  Director  may  deem  it  necessary  and appropriate  to  recall  historical  property  from  heritage  activities  for  reasons  such  as conservation,  preservation  or  security  with  the  concurrence  of  the  USAFHP  Board  of Directors. 6.9.  Accountability  Records.  All  USAF  heritage  activities  must  ensure  the  accountability  of historical property. (T-0). To accomplish this, heritage activities will: 6.9.1.  Maintain  the  following  collections  management  accountability  documents  and  files: (T-1) 6.9.1.1.  Accession  Register.    The  register  is  a  bound,  hardcopy,  written  list  of acquisitions,  entered  by  number  in  a  volume  (preferably  archival  quality  paper)  in indelible  ink.    Entries  in  the  accession  register  include  the  accession  number,  date  of acceptance,  donor  name  and  address  or  contact  information,  type  of  acquisition,  a  brief description  of  the  items,  who  accepted  the  property  on  behalf  of  the  USAFHP,  and  the number of items in the acquisition.  The accession register serves as the source document for the next available accession number.  Retain all volumes for as long as the historical property account exists.  Heritage activities will forward all registers to NMUSAF/MUC when account is closed.  (T-1) AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   37  6.9.1.2.  Accession files.  Heritage activities will establish accession files for all historical property. (T-1) 6.9.1.2.1.  Heritage  activities  are  responsible  for  maintaining  the  original  accession record  for  any  historical  property  accessioned  at  their  site.    These  records  are  filed numerically  by  year  and  contain  the  original  AF  Form  3571  or  appropriate  transfer documents, DD Form 1149 issued by NMUSAF loaning the property to the heritage activity,  supporting  documentation,  correspondence,  and  reference  photographs  (if available)  and/or  digital  images.    Additional  documentation  may  include  AF  Form 3573,  USAF  Heritage  Program  Artifact  condition  and  Conservation  Survey, Explosive  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD)  inert  certification  statement  and/or  radiation safety forms as needed by the object (recommend using six part folders). 6.9.1.2.2.  Historical  property  accessioned  at  NMUSAF  and  on  loan  to  the  heritage activity  retains  the  original  NMUSAF  accession  number.    Accession  files  for  these items  are  maintained  at  NMUSAF,  however,  heritage  activities  will  also  maintain individual accountability files. (T-1). At a minimum these files contain a copy of the DD  Form  1149,  copies  of  any  relevant  safety  forms  (e.g.  radiation,  EOD),  and supporting documentation, correspondence, and current photographs. 6.9.1.3.  Current HPA and inventory provided by NMUSAF/MUC. 6.9.1.4.  Heritage  activities  with  aerospace  vehicles  will  maintain  separate  vehicle  files organized  by  M/D/S  or  accession  number.  (T-1).  These  folders  contain  the  following additional  collections  management  accountability  documents  in  addition  to  those  noted above: 6.9.1.4.1.  All  transfer  documents  or  DD  Form  1149  loaning  the  vehicle  to  the heritage activity. 6.9.1.4.2.  Radiation  survey  and  swipe  forms  (AF  Form  3583,  USAF  Heritage Program  Static  Display  Aerospace  Vehicle/Component  Radiation  Survey  Log,  and AF  Form  3584,  USAF  Museum  Aerospace  Vehicle  Static  display/Component Radiation  Swipe Log). Please note,  as of the publication of this guidance use of AF Form 3584 has been rescinded and it is now obsolete.  AF Form 3584s that document previous  swipe  analyses  collected  prior  to  the  date  of  this  publication  should  be retained. 6.9.1.4.3.  Certificates  for  demilitarization,  safety  and  EOD  inert  verification  (using templates  found  in  DoD  4160.28-M-V3,  Defense  Demilitarization:  Program Administration). 6.9.1.4.4.  AF Form 3581, USAF Heritage Program Aerospace Vehicle Static Display Maintenance Log.   Use this form  to  record all inspections, maintenance,  repair, and other  actions.    Such  actions  include  painting,  washing,  RSI  and  historical  property installation  or  removals,  part  removals,  weapons  uploads,  repair,  and  bird  and weather proofing.  Individuals performing such work must legibly print and sign their names on the form. (T-3) 6.9.1.4.5.  Colors, Markings, and Insignia (CMI) packages (if applicable). 6.9.1.4.6.  All related correspondence.   38  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 6.9.1.4.7.  Maintain  aircraft  files  for  as  long  as  the  heritage  activity  possesses  the aerospace vehicle.  Heritage activities will transfer the file with the aerospace vehicle or retire it to NMUSAF/MUC if the aircraft is disposed of. (T-1) 6.9.2.  New acquisitions 6.9.2.1.  All  historical  property  in  the  custody  of  a  heritage  activity  is  accessioned.  Establish accountability of newly acquired historical property within 24 hours of receipt by adding items to the heritage activity's accession register (see paragraph 6.9.1.1).  Tag artifacts  with  their  accession  numbers  until  they  are  permanently  marked.    Heritage activities will store uncataloged artifacts separately from the remainder of the collection. (T-1) 6.9.2.2.  Heritage  activities  will  complete  an  AF  Form  3571  for  all  donated  historical property (see paragraph 6.6).  (T-1) 6.9.2.3.  Catalog each new approved acquisition within 45 working days using AF Form 3582  which  constitutes  the  primary  record  of  all  historical  property.    All  historical property  is  screened  for  radioactive  material  prior  to  cataloging.    This  can  also  be accomplished by printing out the completed AFMATS accession record which duplicates the information found on AF Form 3582.  Detailed instructions for completing AF Form 3582 are available by request from NMUSAF/MUC. 6.9.2.4.  Once approved acquisitions are cataloged, place secure (yet reversible) accession numbers  on  each  artifact.    Establish  and  document  a  uniform  system  for  applying accession numbers.  Place accession numbers so that they are unobtrusive, do not deface objects  or  detract  from  their  visual  appeal  for  exhibit.    Large  artifacts  such  as  aircraft, missiles, and other large vehicles or equipment do not require permanent marking as long as  some  type  of  unique  identifier  is  present  and  visible  (i.e.  aircraft  identifiable  by  tail number, vehicles or equipment with painted serial numbers, missile type that is the only one at location).  Contact NMUSAF/MUC for guidance. 6.9.2.5.  Report  cataloged  acquisitions  to  NMUSAF/MUC  within  45  working  days  via web based AFMATS database (see paragraph 6.10.3).  If the heritage activity does not have  an  AFMATS  account,  submit  AF  Form  3582  to  the  MAJCOM/HO  for  AFMATS input.    Send  informational  copies  to  NMUSAF/MUC,  and  include  copies  of  AF  Form 3582, AF Form 3571 or other transfer documents (DD Form 1149 or DD Form 1348 for example). Provide EOD inert certifications for munitions and safety certificate (AF Form 3580,  USAF  Heritage  Program  Aerospace  Vehicle  Static  Display  Egress  and  Safety Certificate) for aerospace vehicles.  Include radiation safety forms (Radiation Screening Checklist  or  AF  Forms  3583  and  3584).  Include  digital  images  of  new  acquisitions  in standard format (see paragraph 6.10.1.3). 6.10.  Inventory Reporting and Control.  Proper stewardship of USAFHP collections includes regular and comprehensive inventories of all historical property.  In accordance with RCS: HAF-HO(A)  8801,  Inventory  Report,  NMUSAF/MUC  must  account  for  and  report  all  USAFHP historical  property  every  five  years.    For  historical  property  on  loan  to  heritage  activities, NMUSAF/MUC  sends  out  the  Report  of  Historical  Property  (inventory)  and  a  “Points  of Contact” list to each MAJCOM/HO, DRU, or FOA no later than 1 February of the appropriate year.  MAJCOM/HOs will in turn ensure that the HPCs of their individual heritage activities will AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   39  accomplish  an  item  by  item  inventory  of  all  historical  property.    MAJCOM/HOs  will  reply  to NMUSAF/MUC with  completed inventories no later than 1  May  of the same  year.   FOAs and DRUs submit completed inventories to NMUSAF/MUC directly.  Failure to comply may result in recall of property and account closure. 6.10.1.  To accomplish inventories, heritage activities will: the inventory 6.10.1.1.  Conduct  a comprehensive,  wall-to-wall inventory  of  all historical  property (in storage and on exhibit) assigned to the account.  Physically inspect each item and verify nomenclature  and  accession  number  against listing  provided  by NMUSAF/MUC.  Heritage activities will document discrepancies such as items missing, damaged,  or  deteriorating  via  a  Memo  for  Record  to  include  a  brief  explanation  and recommended  corrective  action  submitted  with  the  inventory.  (T-1).  Annotate  on  the inventory any historical property excess to current needs.  Retain a copy of the completed inventory  for  records.    (See  paragraph  6.12  for  guidance  on  historical  property confirmed to be lost, damaged or destroyed.)  Prior to submission, heritage activities will review  the  “Points  of  Contact”  list  sent  with  their  inventory  and  annotate  changes, corrections, etc. as needed. (T-1). If a new HPC has been assigned, his/her appointment letter, signed by the supporting commander, is included (see paragraph 6.11). 6.10.1.2.  List any historical property on exhibit or in storage received from sources other than NMUSAF that does not appear on the inventory in a Memo for Record and submit with  inventory  and  retain  a  copy.  (T-1).    Provide  completed  AF  Form  3582,  digital images,  AF  Form  3571  (if  appropriate)  and  all  other  accountability  paperwork  that accompanied the property.  These items are accessioned and added to the loan inventory. 6.10.1.3.  Every  fifth  year,  in  conjunction  with  the  comprehensive  inventory,  heritage activities  will  submit  a  current,  digital  image  of  the  following  historical  property:    1) items on display outside; 2) items that have moved on or off exhibit within the reporting cycle;  and  3)  items  that  have  undergone  major  condition  changes  (e.g.  maintenance, restoration,  or  conservation)  within  the  reporting  cycle.    Non-current  images  or  images submitted  in  previous  reporting  cycles  are  not  acceptable.  (T-1).  All  digital  images submitted  are  in  “jpeg”  format.    Name  each  image  file  by  accession  number,  i.e.  1992-3187-0005-0009.    Digital  images  of  each  aerospace  vehicle  must  provide  sufficient resolution and detail to allow positive identification, show the overall condition, and the serial number of the airframe (e.g. do not submit images of aerospace vehicles covered in snow, taken from great distances, or photographed through a fence). 6.10.2.  HPCs  sign  the  inventory  lists  certifying  that  all  historical  property  has  been physically inventoried  and accounted  for and  any  discrepancies noted (see  paragraph  6.12 for guidance on lost or damaged historical property).  Completed inventory packages include the  signed  and  certified  inventory  list  (see  paragraph  6.10),  Memos  for  Record  listing inventory discrepancies, an updated HPC “Point of Contact” list, one copy of the HPA signed by  the  supporting  commander  or  vice  commander,  and  digital  images  of  all  historical property on the loan inventory. 6.10.3.  Air  Force  Museum  Artifact  Tracking  System  (AFMATS).  AFMATS  is  the  central accounting and management program for Air Force historical property and is administered by NMUSAF/MUC and NMUSAF’s Information Technology office.   40  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 6.10.3.1.  Heritage  activities  access  AFMATS  via  a  web  based  system  to  report  new acquisitions  of  historical  property  (see  paragraph  6.2.1)  and  maintain  proper accountability. 6.10.3.2.  All  MAJCOM/HOs  and  heritage  activities  with  inventories  of  300  items  or more  are  required  to  establish  accounts  and  use  AFMATS.  (T-1).  Activities  with  fewer than 300 items may use AFMATS, but are not required to do so.  Activities that do not use  AFMATS  will  report  items  of  historical  property  to  MAJCOM/HO,  who  will  be responsible for ensuring that items are reported using AFMATS to NMUSAF/MUC. (T-1) 6.11.  Change in Historical Property Custodian.  The supporting commander will appoint the primary and alternate HPC (AFFM Directors may appoint alternate HPCs). (T-1). This ensures a chain of custody is always maintained for property on loan to heritage activities. The supporting commander will: the  MAJCOM/HO immediately  of  any  changes.  (T-1). 6.11.1.  Advise MAJCOM/HOs  will  forward  notification  and  letter  appointing  new  HPC  (including  name, grade, e-mail and mailing address, DSN and commercial phone number) to NMUSAF/MUC. in  writing 6.11.2.  Direct  the  incoming  and  outgoing  HPC  to  conduct  a  joint  inventory,  after NMUSAF/MUC  or  MAJCOM/HO  sends  the  current  inventory  to  the  organization.  (T-1). The  incoming  HPC  signs  the  inventory  list  certifying  that  all  historical  property  was physically  inventoried  and  accounted  for.    The  supporting  commander  will  report  any discrepancies through MAJCOM/HO to NMUSAF/MUC (see paragraph 6.12 for guidance on lost or damaged property). (T-1) 6.12.  Lost  and  Damaged  Historical  Property.  If  historical  property  is  suspected  to  be  or confirmed  as  lost,  damaged  or  destroyed,  the  responsible  HPC  must  notify  MAJCOM/HO  or DRU/FOA leadership and NMUSAF/MUC in writing within 1 working day. (T-1). If NMUSAF deems it necessary, MAJCOM/HO or DRU/FOA leadership will request that the commander of the  installation  on  which  the  subject  heritage  activity  is  located  initiate  a  DD  Form  200, Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss in accordance with AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property. (T-1) 6.12.1.  The  Air  Force  does  not  relieve  an  organization  of  accountability  for  the  historical property until  it has completed this or subsequent investigations and made a finding on the disposition of the property.  The surveying officer provides copies of all Reports of Survey through  MAJCOM/HO  to  NMUSAF/MUC.    NMUSAF  will  initiate  deaccession  action where applicable. 6.12.2.  If  a  Report  of  Survey  is  not  required  NMUSAF/MUC  will  initiate  the  deaccession action.  Upon completion MUC will provide a copy of the inventory adjustment voucher to the heritage activity, clearing the activity of accountability for the item. 6.12.3  NMUSAF determines how to dispose of damaged or destroyed historical property. 6.12.4.  In the event that an item previously determined to be lost or stolen is located, contact NMUSAF/MUC for reinstatement.   AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   41  6.13.  Movement. 6.13.1.  Movement  of  historical  property,  which  includes  aerospace  vehicles,  between heritage  activities  requires  approval  by  MAJCOM/HO  and  NMUSAF.    Relocation  of aerospace  vehicles  within  the  confines  of  the  existing  installation  is  approved  by MAJCOM/HO. 6.13.1.1.  The  gaining  organization  is  responsible  for  safely  moving  historical  property and  bears  relevant  expenses  as  per  the  HPA.    NMUSAF/MUC  will  supply  the  loan documents and AF Forms 3580 and 3583. 6.13.1.2.  The gaining organization will ship all historical property via trackable shipping services.  (T-1) 6.13.1.3.  The  gaining  organization  funds  but  the  losing  organization  is  responsible  for ensuring the proper packaging of the artifacts for movement. The losing organization will use a packing mode compatible with the composition of the item being shipped. (T-2) 6.13.1.4.  Do  not  relocate  aerospace  vehicles  without  prior  written  approval  by NMUSAF/MUC.  The  gaining  organization  will  assume  accountability  for  mishaps  and oversees  security  of  the  load,  road  clearances,  qualifications  of  the  drivers,  special licenses and permits and all other considerations.  (T-2) 6.13.1.5.  When  relocating  aerospace  vehicles,  do  not  cut  structural  components  to facilitate movement or relocation without approval of NMUSAF. 6.13.1.6.  Air Force policy prohibits the flight of USAFHP aircraft. 6.13.2.  Acceptance  of  aerospace  vehicles  coming  from  the  active  inventory  (AF/A8PB)  or other DoD or government organizations. 6.13.2.1.  The  gaining  organization  will  provide  MAJCOM/HO  and  NMUSAF/MUC written notification of arrival within 24 hours. (T-3) 6.13.2.2.  NMUSAF/MUC provides the loan documents to the gaining organization. 6.13.2.3.  Reclamation requirements (“save lists”) are provided by the appropriate System Program  Office  (SPO).  Organizations  performing  reclamation  coordinate  scheduling requirements  with  SPO  personnel  to  determine  save  list  need  dates.    Save  list requirements are forecasted well in advance (minimum 45 days) to allow for preparation time,  review,  and  approval  processes.    In  some  cases  gaining  activities  may  not  have capability  and  resources  to  execute  save  lists.    NMUSAF  will  not  accept  aerospace vehicle  transfers  until  reclamation  plans  are  finalized  which  outline  what  organization (losing,  gaining,  or  other)  will  be  responsible  for  executing  save  list  actions.    Actions include  parts  removal,  packaging,  and  shipping  back  to  applicable  inventory  control points. 6.13.2.4.  The  organization  performing  egress,  safety,  demilitarization  and  engine removal (unless needed for integral support or aesthetic appeal) will: 6.13.2.4.1.  Complete AF Form 3580. (T-1). 6.13.2.4.2.  Complete  certification  for  demilitarization,  safety  and  EOD  inert verification (using templates found in DoD 4160.28-M-V3). (T-0)   42  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 6.13.2.4.3.  Complete  annotated  demilitarization  workbook  associated  with  the aerospace vehicle (if provided). (T-0). 6.13.2.4.4.  Ensure all documentation is completed by a certified technician and sent to NMUSAF/MUC and MAJCOM/HO.  (T-0) 6.13.2.5.  Once flight-delivered to a display site, aerospace vehicles on loan are for static display only and additional flights are not authorized. 6.13.2.6.  The  NMUSAF  does  not  accept  accountability  for  a  new  acquisition  from  the active  inventory,  other  governmental  agencies,  or  an  exchange  agreement  until  the delivery  flight  has  safely  landed,  shut  down,  and  chocked  at  the  display  location.    The organization  sponsoring  the  display  location  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  all  safety, egress, demilitarization actions and engine removal (unless needed for integral support or aesthetic appeal) are accomplished. (T-1) 6.14.  Managing  Restoration  Support  Items  (RSI)  Management.  RSI  is  material  for restoration,  repair,  or  preservation  of  historical  property  and  does  not  include  bench  stock  (see paragraph 6.2.4).  RSI is government property and is controlled. 6.14.1.  Heritage activities establish RSI requirements to support restoration projects defined in an approved exhibit plan or for repairs or preservation of historical property. 6.14.1.1.  Heritage  activities  coordinate  RSI  requirements  with  the  MAJCOM/HO  and NMUSAF. 6.14.1.2.  Heritage  activities  will  not  accumulate,  stockpile,  or  retain  RSI  in  excess  of requirements. (T-1) 6.14.2.  Heritage  activities  may  obtain  RSI  through  procurement  channels,  or,  after coordination with MAJCOM/HO, may submit a Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP) request for restoration or repair purposes to the NMUSAF.  Provide the following information: 6.14.2.1.  M/D/S, serial number and accession number of the historical property on which the part or parts will be installed. 6.14.2.2.  Part number (PN) or National Stock Number (NSN). 6.14.2.3.  TO reference including: 6.14.2.3.1.  TO number. 6.14.2.3.2.  Figure number in TO that shows the part. 6.14.2.3.3.  Index number of the part. 6.14.2.3.4.  Complete nomenclature of the part. 6.14.2.3.5.  Quantity requested. 6.14.2.4.  Shipping information including: 6.14.2.4.1.  DODAAC number of the requesting heritage activity. 6.14.2.4.2.  “Ship To” and “Mark For” addresses. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   43  6.14.2.4.3.  Point of contact, DSN telephone number, DSN fax number  and electronic mail address at the requesting organization. 6.14.3.  Heritage  activities  keep  accurate  records  of  each  item  with  an  identifying  RSI sequence number, its nomenclature, quantity, application and location. Maintain and provide copy of local inventories and finding aids to MAJCOM/HO. 6.14.4.  Heritage  activities  identify  excess  restoration  project  items  for  disposition,  in coordination with MAJCOM/HO and NMUSAF.  This includes RSI and part or parts being replaced by RSI. 6.14.5.  Heritage  activities  accomplish  disposition  in  accordance  with  Federal  statutes  and implementing DoD and USAFHP disposition guidance. With the exception of NMUSAF (see paragraph 1.5.6.4), heritage activities are prohibited from direct dispositions (loan, donation, transfer,  and  exchange)  of  RSI  or  restoration  project  items  to  individuals,  organizations,  or entities  outside  the  USAFHP.    Heritage  activities  forward  disposition  requests  via  the MAJCOM/HO to NMUSAF for action. 6.15.  Aircraft  Parts  Removals.  Parts  required  on  Air  Force  “save  lists”  are  authorized  for removal  when  aerospace  vehicles  are  transferred  to  NMUSAF.    NMUSAF  will  approve  on  a case-by-case basis any subsequent parts removals from USAF static display aerospace vehicles. NOTE:  Aircraft destined for NMUSAF are subject to limited reclamation actions.  Parts cannot be reclaimed from NMUSAF aerospace vehicles if doing so detracts from the vehicle’s display appearance.        If  urgent  requirements  necessitate  removal  of  such  an  item,  SPO  and  inventory management  personnel  attempt  to  obtain  a  like  replacement  (i.e.  condemned  asset,  fabricated item). 6.15.1.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  NMUSAF  considers  supporting  requests  for  Mission Impaired  Capability  Awaiting  Parts  (MICAP)  if  all  other  sources  have  been  exhausted.  Requests are submitted to NMUSAF who will validate each one with  the appropriate SPO. NMUSAF should be considered a last source for needed parts. 6.15.2.  NMUSAF  will  forward  MICAP  requests  to  HQ  AFMC/A4LM  for  review  and recommendation.  Such requests contain detailed documentation of SPO efforts to obtain the required  assets  from  the  supply  system  or  Aerospace  Marketing  and  Regeneration  Group (AMARG) and the reasons those actions were not successful. 6.15.3.  Removals  from  USAF  static  display  aircraft  for  use  on  active,  operational  aircraft, are  processed  through  standard  supply  channels  to  ensure  visibility  of  the  demand  and appropriate  reimbursements.    SPO  and  inventory  management  personnel  will  work  with NMUSAF  to  replace  any  parts  removed  from  an  aerospace  vehicle  to  support  a  MICAP request with a like item, if the display appearance of the vehicle is impacted. (T-1) 6.15.4.  Heritage  activities  must  verify  that  any  authorized  aircraft  part(s)  removal  or replacement  has  occurred.    (T-1).  Documentation  includes  a  photograph  of  the  part(s) removed and be noted on AF Form 3581.  Heritage activities will send digital image(s) and notification  of  removal  or  replacement  via  e-mail  to  NMUSAF/MUC  for  inclusion  in  the aerospace vehicle file.  (T-1) 6.15.5.  Heritage  activities  will  document,  as  directed  by  NMUSAF,  removal  of  parts  to support other USAFHP needs or to address a safety or security issue.  (T-1)   44  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 6.16.  Disposing of Historical Property.  Each HPC notifies the MAJCOM/HO of any historical property excess to its needs.  DRUs and FOAs contact the NMUSAF for disposition guidance. 6.16.1.  MAJCOM/HOs, in coordination with NMUSAF/MUC, may authorize the transfer of historical  property  to  other  heritage  activities  within  their  command.    Historical  property determined  to  be  excess  to  the  command  is  reported  to  NMUSAF/MUC  for  reallocation  to other  heritage  activities,  use  in  the  USAF  Civilian  Museum  Loan  Program,  USAF  Static Display  Program,  NMUSAF  Exchange  Program,  or  other  approved  disposition.  Based  on these  requirements,  the  NMUSAF  will  issue  a  disposition  plan  to  cover  these  alternatives.  The losing organization will bear all associated cost for historical property that is not going to be reallocated and will be disposed of through DLA Disposition Services. (T-1) 6.16.2.  Historical  property  determined  to  be  excess  to  needs  will  not  be  (a)  given,  sold  or traded away; (b) returned to donors if it has been accepted as a donation and accessioned as historical  property;  (c)  transferred  to  civilian  organizations;  or  (d)  transferred  to  other heritage activities without prior approval of NMUSAF and MAJCOM/HOs. 6.16.3.  NMUSAF will be responsible for preparing all transfer documents. The HPC will be responsible  for  preparing  all  turn-in  documents  for  historical  property  being  disposed  of through DLA Disposition Services. (T-1). HPC will provide copies of all turn-in documents (listing each item individually with accession number) to NMUSAF. (T-1) 6.16.4.  If  a  heritage  activities  has  declared  excess  any  historical  property  which  must  be returned  to  NMUSAF,  it  will  bear  all  expenses  associated  with  moving,  reclaiming,  and/or demilitarizing the property. (T-1) 6.16.5.  Abandoned or unclaimed privately owned property.  Heritage activities must exercise due  diligence  when  encountering  abandoned  or  unclaimed  property.  (T-1).  This  may  occur when  a  potential  donation  without  documentation  is  discovered  at  the  activity.    A conscientious effort is made to find the owner (or heirs, next of kin, or legal representative of the  owner)  in  accordance  with  DoD  7000.14R,  Volume  11A  Chapter  5,  DoD  Financial Management Regulation. 6.16.5.1.  Should a USAFHP activity determine the property is wanted for the historical collection, it must conduct a documented search for donor information, to the maximum extent  practicable,  not  later  than  seven  days  after  the  date  on  which  the  property  came into its custody or control. (T-1). This search period may not exceed 45 days. If the donor cannot  be located,  accession  the property, noting its source of acquisition as “Found on Base”. 6.16.5.2.  Should a USAFHP activity determine the property is unwanted, items may be turned  over  to  installation  security  forces  in  accordance  with  AFPD  31-1,  Integrated Defense, DoD 4160.21-M and AFI 31-206, Security Forces Investigations Program. 6.17.  Archaeological Materials. 6.17.1.  Archaeological  materials  and  specimens  recovered  from  Air  Force-controlled  lands are  the  property  of  the  U.S.  Government.  AFI  32-7065,  Cultural  Resources  Management Program provides guidance regarding Air Force archaeological materials. 6.17.2.  Archaeological  materials  and  specimens  are  not  USAFHP  property.    Heritage activities should decline donations of such material as most fall outside the activity’s mission AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   45  and  scope  of  collections.    Such  items  may  be  displayed  at  heritage  activities  if  relevant, appropriate, and detailed in a current exhibit plan.  Account for these items as an incoming loan  (see  paragraph  6.7.2).    No  USAFHP  activity  will  be  established  for  the  primary purpose of displaying and caring for archaeological materials and specimens. (T-1) 6.18.  National  Register  of  Historic  Places.  Historical  property  on  the  National  Register includes  the  physical  remains  of  prehistoric  or  historic  districts,  sites,  buildings,  structures  or objects  significant  in  American  history,  architecture,  archeology,  engineering  or  culture.  USAFHP property is not to be nominated for inclusion on the National Register.  For guidance on the criteria used to designate and protect National Register properties, consult AFI 32-7065 or Air Force Asset Management Directorate (AF/A7AM).   46  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 Chapter 7 CONSERVATION AND DISPLAY STANDARDS 7.1.  Conserving  Artifacts.  A  heritage  activity’s  artifact  collection  is  its  most  important component and that which identifies and defines it.  Acquiring historical property (all artifacts, including  aerospace  vehicles)  through  loan  or  donation  obligates  an  activity  with  its  care  and stewardship.    As  such,  ensuring  the  physical  care,  preservation,  and  conservation  of  that historical property is of paramount importance. 7.1.1.  Heritage  activities  are  prohibited  from  using  any  artifact  accessioned  as  historical property to serve its original function, no matter how sound its condition.  Consumptive use of  artifacts  is  prohibited,  including  but  not  limited  to,  wearing  historical  clothing  or  flying, operating, or firing any artifact.  Except as noted in paragraph 6.8.2, the public is prohibited from  accessing  the  interior  of  loaned  aircraft  (cockpit,  cargo  areas,  etc.)  to  ensure preservation of the aerospace vehicle and the safety of visitors. 7.1.2.  Protect  all  historical  property  from  agents  of  deterioration  whether  on  exhibit  or  in storage.    These  include:    vermin,  mold,  mildew,  mechanical  stress,  dust,  pollution, vandalism,  excessive  heat  and  humidity,  and  prolonged  exposure  to  ultra-violet  (U/V)  and infrared as well as visible light extremes. Thoroughly check all incoming textiles for signs of mold, mildew or vermin infestation prior to introduction to the existing collection. 7.1.3.  Preserve museum objects and prolong their usefulness to the study of material culture by  maintaining  artifacts  in  normal  museum  conditions.    Normal  museum  conditions  are considered to be a stable environment that is free from repeated daily and seasonal extreme changes of temperature, humidity, and light.  Heritage activities with artifacts on exhibit or in storage should strive to maintain a constant temperature of 67 degrees and relative humidity of  47  percent,  with  no  more  than  a  5  degree  temperature  or  5  percent  humidity  variation.  Regularly monitor environmental conditions in all areas.  Inability to control temperature and humidity  may  necessitate  the  removal  of  items  that  are  negatively  impacted  by  climate fluctuations. 7.1.4.  Use reasonable care to protect rare and historically significant examples of aerospace vehicles  and  support  equipment  from  the  weather  and  changing  climates.    Do  not  display aerospace vehicles of predominantly wood and fabric construction outside. 7.1.5.  Protect  delicate  original  fabrics,  finishes,  and  materials  from  deterioration  by following generally accepted museum conservation standards found in The Care of Antiques and  Historical  Collections  by  A.  Bruce  MacLeish,  published  by  the  American  Association for  State  and  Local  History,  1717  Church  Street,  Nashville  TN  37203-2991.    Protect photographic  negatives,  prints,  audio/visual  materials  and  electronic  resources  such  as  CDs and DVDs following generally accepted archival preservation methods and standards found in  Preserving  Archives  and  Manuscripts  by  Mary  Lynn  Ritzenthaler,  published  by  The Society of American Archivists, 2010.  Refer artifact conservation matters to the NMUSAF Conservator,  NMUSAF/MUC  and  archival  conservation  matters  to  NMUSAF  Manuscript Curators, NMUSAF/MUA who assists in determining appropriate action. 7.1.6.  Protect archived photographic prints in chemically inert polypropylene, polyethylene, or polyester (Mylar) archival sleeves.  Protect negatives in protective archival safe, acid-free, AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   47  non-buffered paper sleeves. Wear white cotton gloves (without non-slip grips) when handling un-sleeved  photographs,  negatives,  and  transparencies.    Apply  numbers  in  soft  pencil  to individual reference material items and affix permanent numbers to folders or containers. 7.1.7.  Create  a  Collection  Management  Disaster  Contingency  Plan  that  outlines  both  the prevention of and response to disasters involving historical property (see paragraph 8.3.4.3). 7.1.8.  Collections storage. 7.1.8.1.  Ensure collection storage areas are locked and accessible only to essential staff or volunteers. 7.1.8.2.  Roll  large  two-dimensional  textiles,  such  as  flags  and  colors,  on  museum-safe cylindrical supports and suspend them horizontally if possible. 7.1.8.3.  Hang garments on padded hangers or lay them flat in wide drawers with proper padding to ensure support. 7.1.8.4.  Raise  bottom  shelves  of  open-shelf  collection  storage  units  far  enough  off  the floor  to  minimize  damage  if  flooding  should  occur  (at  least  4  inches  is  generally recommended). 7.2.  Handling and Displaying Artifacts. 7.2.1.  Within reason, display all artifacts in cases. 7.2.2.  Wear  white  cotton  gloves  (vinyl,  un-powdered  latex  or  nitrile  may  be  substituted) when  handling  artifacts.    Wear  white  cotton  gloves  without  non-slip  grips  when  handling silver. 7.2.3.  Use  museum-safe  materials  to  construct  exhibit  furnishings.    Such  materials  prevent contact between artifacts and hostile surfaces or between artifacts of dissimilar materials (see Attachment 4). 7.2.4.  Mount artifacts in such a way as to prevent movement, damage, or theft.  Do not use materials  or  methods  of  mounting  that  stress,  damage,  or  in  any  manner  alter  the  artifact being displayed. 7.2.5.  Do  not  put  screws,  nails,  pins,  single-  or  double-sided  tape,  or  other  adhesives  in direct  contact  with  any  artifact  (i.e.  nailing  or  stapling  a  flag  or  guidon  to  a  display  case backing;  scotch  taping  a  photograph  or  documentary  artifact  to  display  case  backing).    Do not use aquarium cement, which emits acetic acid during curing time. 7.2.6.  Ensure  all  mat  board,  whether  used  as  mounting,  barriers,  or  identification  labels,  is 100 percent acid-free.  Do not affix or place identification labels directly onto artifacts (with pins, nails, staples or adhesives). 7.2.7.  Do not display original photographs, archival documents, or records.  Use color laser or photographic copies instead.  Label any copies on exhibit as copies or reproductions. 7.2.8.  Treatment  or  repair  of  damaged  artifacts,  except  by  a  trained  professional,  can  often result  in  further  damage.    Document  any  damage  or  deterioration  to  artifacts  on  AF  Form 3573.    Address  questions  on  standard  conservation  methods  and  mounting  artifacts  for display  to  the  NMUSAF  Conservator.    Refer  archival  preservation  questions  to  Manuscript Curators, NMUSAF Research Division.   48  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 7.2.9.  Include, at a minimum, identification labels for historical property on exhibit.  Include longer,  more  comprehensive  interpretive  labels  in  exhibits  according  to  the  exhibit  script.  See Attachment 4 for specific label design requirements. 7.3.  Restoration  and Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles  and Support Equipment.  Proper restoration  and  routine  maintenance  ensures  aerospace  vehicles  and  related  equipment  are  safe and  properly  configured  to  accurately  reflect  USAF  history,  heritage  and  traditions.    To  the greatest  extent  possible,  these  functions  are  accomplished  on  a  preplanned  scheduled  basis.  Planning  provides  the  most  effective  and  efficient  use  of  people,  facilities  and  equipment, reduces unscheduled maintenance, and allows for progressive actions toward displaying vehicles and equipment for the long term. 7.3.1.  At  a  minimum,  schedule  maintenance  and/or  restoration  actions  to  keep  aerospace vehicles  and  related  equipment  from  deteriorating  further.    Perform  limited  disassembly  of the  vehicle  and  selected  disassembly  of  components.    Thoroughly  inspect  the  aerospace vehicle and locate, identify and remove all areas of corrosion.  Make sure the vehicle is clean and  free  from  dirt,  debris,  carbon  and  contaminants.    Apply  a  corrosion-preventative chemical  film  as  specified  in  the  appropriate  aircraft  Technical  Order  (TO)  to  all  surfaces, reassemble  all  components  and  items,  apply  final  chemical  coating  and  protect  the  vehicle from the elements while it awaits restoration. 7.3.2.  Schedule  periodic  inspections  and  maintenance  to  assist  in  the  preservation  of aerospace  vehicles  and  related  equipment.    Reapplication  of  colors,  markings  and  insignia (CMI) packages on vehicles displayed outdoors should be accomplished on a recommended 5  year  interval  or  units  may  use  a  scoring  system  in  accordance  with  AFI  20-114,  Air  and Space Equipment Structural Management.  Accomplish cleaning and related treatments more frequently if conditions warrant. 7.3.2.1.  Heritage  activities  will  establish  corrosion  prevention  and  control  programs  if they  are  responsible  for  maintenance  of  aerospace  vehicles  and  related  equipment  as required  by  AFI  20-114.  (T-1).  The  type  of  program  depends  upon  the  environment  to which the aerospace vehicle is exposed.  Vehicles and equipment displayed outdoors may be exposed to industrial gases, salts, rain or mud.  An effective corrosion prevention and control program includes thorough cleaning, inspections, and preservation. 7.3.2.2.  Check  for  corrosion  damage  and  integrity  of  protective  finishes  during  all scheduled  and  unscheduled  maintenance.    Early  detection  and  repair  of  corrosion  limit further damage.  When corrosion is discovered, treat corrosion as soon as possible using only approved materials, equipment and techniques.  Repair affected areas only.  Seal and paint as needed in accordance with TO 1-1-8 and the systems specific TO. 7.3.2.3.  Clean  aerospace  vehicles  and  related  equipment  regularly  in  order  to  prevent corrosion  by  removing  salt  deposits,  other  corrosive  soils  and  electrolytes.    Ensure  that periodic  washing  of  vehicles  or  equipment  displayed  outdoors  complies  with  all  local environmental policies and regulations. 7.3.3.  Restore  aerospace  vehicles  and  equipment  to  original  manufacturer's  or  operational appearance  for  the  period  depicted.    Repair  all  damages  except  in  those  instances  when  it may be critical to the historical character, integrity, or provenance of the artifact (e.g. battle damage).    In  these  cases,  damage  should  not  be  altered.    Systems  need  not  be  operational.  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   49  Interior  areas  remain  as  received  unless  being  restored.    The  work  need  not  conform  to airworthy  standards.    Strip,  clean,  brighten,  coat  with  a  corrosion  preventative  and  give  a final finish coat to the airframe.  Damaged or missing components may be remanufactured to less than original or airworthy standards.  NOTE: Radioactive materials may have been used in  the  construction  of  aerospace  vehicles.    Follow  the  procedures  in  Chapter  9  for  dealing with radioactive components before doing any work on an aerospace vehicle.  Fulfill all local bioenvironmental engineering requirements. 7.3.3.1.  When repairing and restoring aerospace vehicles and related equipment, preserve their  historical  integrity.    Use  methods  outlined  in  the  appropriate  maintenance  and erection  manual  and  the  structural  repair  manual.    NMUSAF  or  MAJCOM/HO  may approve  non-standard  changes  that  compromise  authenticity  only  to  enhance  the  long-term preservation of items displayed outdoors.  All such procedures are reversible.  Use AF Form 3581 to record all maintenance, preservation and restoration actions. 7.3.3.2.  MAJCOM/HO  (or  senior  historian  or  curator  for  DRUs  and  FOAs)  approves aircraft configuration as  well as CMI packages.  Requesting units will conduct  research and  develop  a  package  that  includes  appropriate  documentation  and  justification  for displayed configuration and paint scheme, to include all equipment and applied markings (standard, MAJCOM, unit assignment, crew) for the date and time period depicted. (T-1). Units may paint aircraft  to  represent  another aircraft of the same series and model with the written permission of the MAJCOM/ DRU/ FOA Historian.  Units will document the justification for and approval of all such actions. (T-2) 7.3.3.2.1.    For  aerospace  vehicles  on  which  the  original  serial  number  has  been  altered for  display  purposes,  stencil  the  model,  design,  and  series  (i.e.  F-100C  or  F-4C)  in addition to the original serial number in two- inch letters using contrasting paint colors on the fuselage under the horizontal stabilizer. 7.3.3.2.2.  Do  not  compromise  the  authenticity  of  a  vehicle  or  equipment  by  adding spurious  names,  logos,  nose  art,  or  other  identifying  features  that  violate  historical accuracy or integrity.  Do not compromise CMIs for reasons of personal gratification.  Do  not  mix  markings  from  a  variety  of  aircraft,  i.e.  using  the  nose  art  from  one aircraft, the serial  number of  another and unit codes from  a third.  Ensure historical accuracy in the placement and style of markings being applied, keeping in mind the "window"  or  "moment"  of  history  to  be  represented.    Units  will  fully  document  all markings  being  applied  to  aerospace  vehicles  and  related  equipment  and  validate prior to painting. (T-1) 7.3.3.2.3.  Annotate  AF  Form  3581  accordingly.    Keep  the  aerospace  vehicle’s  true tail number on all records. 7.3.3.3.  Aerospace vehicle signage. 7.3.3.3.1.  All  aerospace  vehicles  on  display  include  identifying  signage  placed  near the vehicle noting, at a minimum, information such as type, model and serial number.  Signage also includes the following statement: “This (aerospace vehicle) is a part of the  USAF  Heritage  Program  collection.”    Previous  iterations  need  not  be  changed unless signage is renewed.   50  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 7.3.3.3.2.  Aerospace vehicles in which the original serial number has been altered for display  purposes  (see  paragraph  7.3.3.2.1)  include  signage  stating  the  following:  “The aircraft on display  is  (NOMENCLATURE), Serial  No. _______________, but painted  and  marked  to  depict  aircraft  Serial  No.  ________________,  assigned  to (UNIT AND/OR PERSON) in (LOCATION OR THEATER) during (YEAR)”. 7.3.4.  Display standards.  All aerospace vehicles are displayed and protected in accordance with  this  Instruction,  the  HPA  and  its  attachments.    At  a  minimum,  the  following  is accomplished and maintained: 7.3.4.1.  Secure the canopies, windows, doors, hatches, and panels of aerospace vehicles on display from public entry. 7.3.4.2.  Remove antenna wires from vehicles on outdoor display to discourage their use as places for birds to roost. 7.3.4.3.  Where  appropriate,  bird  proof  aerospace  vehicles  on  outdoor  display  by screening,  plugging  or  covering  vents,  nozzles,  wheel  wells,  cowlings  and  cowl  flap areas, intakes, airscoops and exhausts (piston or turbine engines). 7.3.4.4.  Secure  retractable  landing  gears  on  all  aerospace  vehicles  that  are  in  the  down position with positive locking devices. 7.3.4.5.  Prevent water accumulation in the airframe, display mount or supporting devices of aerospace vehicles displayed outside. 7.3.4.6.  Use  tie-down  devices  on  aerospace  vehicles  displayed  outdoors  (where appropriate) sufficient to withstand local conditions. 7.3.4.7.   Secure control surfaces. 7.4.  Designing  Exhibits.  Exhibits  follow  an  approved  storyline,  be  historically  accurate, without  distortion,  and  in  good  taste.    (Exhibit  storylines  are  outlined  and  approved  in  the strategic plan.)  Requests for specific aerospace vehicles and artifacts are not considered unless justified in an approved strategic plan (see paragraph 6.5.1.3). 7.4.1.  Comply with the exhibit standards outlined in Attachment 4. 7.4.2.  Design exhibits to discourage visitors from touching or handling the artifacts. 7.4.3.  Bombs,  missiles  and  other  equipment  should  not  be  suspended  from  aerospace vehicles because of the strong potential for irreparable damage to  airframes over time.  For display  purposes,  use  lightweight  replicas  of  fiberglass  or  other  inert  materials.    Contact NMUSAF for a list of vendors of such equipment. 7.4.4.  Static displays of  aerospace vehicles  and  equipment  deserve special  attention related to criteria for their site development. 7.4.4.1.  Plan  and  construct  the  site  to  withstand  the  worst-case  weather  conditions,  as appropriate to the location. 7.4.4.2.  Engineer the site to handle the static weight of the item.  Use paved surfaces or concrete pads for aerospace vehicles to be displayed on their landing gear or carriage, and use wheel stands or tire fill to relieve stress on components and reduce ground pressure.  Aerospace vehicles mounted on poles or suspended from overhead structures should be AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   51  done  with  consideration  to  aircraft  weight  and  structural  integrity,  facility  structural weight and integrity, and weather conditions as necessary and appropriate.  Ensure static display  site  development  (e.g.  stands,  tie-downs,  concrete)  is  in  accordance  with  civil engineering and aircraft maintenance requirements. 7.4.4.3.  When suspending artifacts  from  overhead, consult  installation civil engineering for  approval,  providing  specific  details  such  as  weight,  proposed  rigging  and  exact location for suspending artifact. 7.4.4.4.  Keep  the  immediate  area  under  and  around  the  vehicle  clear  of  vegetation, plants, trees and direct contact with lawn sprinkler systems.  Ensure appropriate clearance exists for lawn maintenance equipment (e.g. mowers).   52  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 Chapter 8 SECURITY, SAFETY, AND RESOURCE PROTECTION 8.1.  Securing  Property.  Security  within  the  USAFHP  is  broadly  defined  to  include  the physical security of facilities and historical properties from theft, incidental damage, fire, natural disaster, or terrorist threat. Security is a heritage activity management responsibility executed in concert with the installation's resource protection plan. 8.1.1.  Methods of meeting security needs cannot alter or in any way harm the integrity of Air Force historical property. 8.1.2.  HPCs, assisted as necessary by other base agencies, conduct or review a facilities risk assessment(s)  as  needed  but  at  a  minimum  of  every  4  years  to  identify  the  most  probable threats,  hazards,  and  those  potential  losses  that  would  most  critically  affect  the  USAFHP activity.  Heritage activities occupying part of another building will coordinate facilities risk assessments and findings with the facility manager. 8.1.3.  Aerospace vehicles, their components, and all other classes of property as previously defined in Chapter 6 are Government property in accordance with AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force.  When dealing with such property, follow  all  applicable  directives  for  accountability,  control,  and  safeguarding.    Do  not  sell, give  away,  trade,  or  loan  these  items.    RSI,  though  not  historical  property,  remains Government  property  and  is  controlled  according  to  local  methods  and  procedures  (see paragraph 6.14). 8.1.4.  Significant  artifacts  represent  items  that  may  be  considered  significant  due  to  their important historical provenance or association, high value, are sensitive in nature and require special protection.  Heritage activity must maintain a local listing of significant artifacts, in coordination with MAJCOM/HO, and limit access to this listing to key personnel. (T-1) 8.1.5.  Significant  artifacts  not  on  display  are  stored  inside  secure  containers  or  safes.  Heritage  activity  must  use  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense  (FOUO),  to  determine  security requirements.  (T-1) 8.1.6.  Display  significant  artifacts  in  secure  cases  built  to  the  security  case  standards contained  in  Attachment  4.    (See  paragraph  11.3.1  for  requirements  associated  with  the display  of  firearms.)    Provide  such  cases  with  appropriate  protection  and  coordinate  with base Security Forces. 8.2.  Safety. 8.2.1.  Safety of personnel.  Ensure the physical safety of visitors, employees, and volunteers who  work  at,  visit,  or  serve  USAFHP  heritage  activities.    This  includes  adhering  to applicable federal, state, and local laws, DoD, Air Force and base directives, instructions, and policies as well as implementing local  Operating  Instructions (OIs) and policies that reflect the specific and unique needs of individual heritage activities. 8.2.2.  Safety of USAFHP historical property. 8.2.2.1.  Do  not  use  aeronautical  components  from  aerospace  vehicles  on  loan  from NMUSAF collections in operational Air Force aerospace vehicles.

All  such actions are accomplished by technically qualified and appropriately trained personnel as per  DoD  4160.28-M-V3,  “Defense  Demilitarization:  Procedural  Guidance”.    Follow “Instructions for Preparation and Maintenance of Aerospace Vehicles,” HPA Attachment A,  to  ensure  the  safe  display  of  the  item.    Certify  all  pre-display  safety  actions  on  AF Form  3580.    Heritage  activity  must  keep  the  original  in  the  individual  aircraft  file  and forward a copy to NMUSAF/MUC. (T-1) 8.2.2.3.  Hazards  such  as  asbestos  and  other  toxic  materials  used  in  aircraft  and  missile manufacturing may be encountered during maintenance or restoration.  Heritage activities will ensure installation bioenvironmental engineering office conducts  and documents an assessment  of  aerospace  vehicles  for  hazards  before  beginning  maintenance  or restoration. (T-1).  Coordinate all remedial actions with the installation bioenvironmental engineering office.  See Chapter 9 for guidance about radiation safety. 8.2.2.4.  Heritage activity must ensure that safety and demilitarization actions performed on  USAF  historical  property  have  been  properly  accomplished  and  documented  in accordance with applicable regulations, instructions, policies, and TOs. (T-0) 8.2.2.5.  Heritage  activity  will  not  store  hazardous  materials  near  artifact  storage, preparation, or display areas. (T-0) 8.2.2.6.  NMUSAF may request that nearby active, National Guard or Air Force Reserve units inspect Air Force historical property on loan to civilian museums. 8.2.2.7.  Heritage  activity  must  ensure  all  employees,  volunteers,  or  contractors  who perform  aerospace  vehicle  maintenance  or  restoration  are  notified  of  all  known  hazards and required mitigation. (T-0) 8.3.  Resource Protection. 8.3.1.  Heritage activity must provide fire detection system(s) in all locations where historical property  is  displayed  or  stored,  and  connect  the  central  alarm  to  the  installation  fire department. (T-0) 8.3.2.  Heritage  activity  must  provide  fire  suppression  systems,  in  addition  to  fire extinguishers, in all display, workshop, and storage areas of the facility. (T-0) 8.3.3.  Heritage  activity  must  ensure  the  installation  fire  marshal  inspects  fire  detection  and suppression  systems  and  inspects  emergency,  battery-powered  lighting  systems  as  required by applicable AFIs and local policies. (T-0) 8.3.4.  Heritage  activities  establish  OIs,  MOUs  or  other  procedures  to  meet  minimum security  and  emergency  response  needs  in  coordination  with  the  appropriate  installation agency  to  ensure  compliance  with  AFIs.    Heritage  activities  will  provide  education  and training for heritage activity staff and volunteers. (T-1) 8.3.4.1.  People and Resource Protection.  Examples of protection measures may include opening  and  closing  procedures,  anti-robbery  and  robbery  responses,  bomb  threat notification, evacuation procedures, active shooter policy and procedures, high cash value   54  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 resource  protection,  fire  detection/suppression  equipment  checks,  emergency  lighting checks,  and  firearm  inventories.    Heritage  activities  will  develop  and  disseminate emergency action books to staff and volunteers.  (T-2) 8.3.4.2.  Disaster  Preparedness.    This  includes  plans  to  deal  with  severe  weather,  (e.g. tornados  or  hurricanes),  Shelter  in  Place,  hazardous  materials  emergencies,  and evacuations.    Heritage  activities  should  participate  in  base-wide  disaster  preparedness exercises and be included in  the base emergency notification and recall plans.  Disaster preparedness also includes post-emergency recovery actions and procedures. 8.3.4.3.  Collection  Management  Disaster  Contingency  Plan.    This  plan  outlines contingency plans for preventing potential disasters to artifact collections and responding to  actual  disasters  involving  collections.    Review  plan  at  least  biennially  and  update  as necessary.  Contact NMUSAF/MUC for specific guidance, resources, and plan templates. 8.3.4.4.  Radioactive/Hazardous  Material  Emergencies.

Consult  base  civil engineering office for applicable standards. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   55  Chapter 9 RADIATION SAFETY 9.1.  Program Direction.  Radioactive materials can be present in a broad spectrum of domestic and  foreign  aviation  artifacts  produced  as  early  as  World  War  I.    Materials  made  before  the 1960s present potential hazards because of the wide use of radium at that time and the possibility of  contamination  due  to  oxidation  and  breakage.    Heritage  activities  consult  with  their installation  RSO  when  developing  and  disseminating  policies  and  procedures  for  safely displaying, storing, and handling radioactive historical property or components, including RSI, in accordance with AFI 40-201, Managing Radioactive Materials in the US Air Force and AFI 48-148, Ionizing Radiation Protection.  In the event of a conflict in guidance, AFI 40-201 and AFI 48-148  or  a  current  issued  Air  Force  Radioactive  Material  Permit  takes  precedence  over  this instruction concerning radiological matters. 9.2.  Responsibility.  HPCs,  or  designee,  will  oversee  their  heritage  activity’s  radiation  safety program.  (T-1).  The  designee  must  be  a  DoD  employee.  (T-0).  Heritage  activities  coordinate with  the  installation  RSO  or  designee  to  ensure  a  qualified  individual  accomplishes  the following: 9.2.1.  Schedule and perform radiation screens for all historical property (including aerospace vehicles) and RSI when received. 9.2.2.  Ensure follow-up surveys are conducted, as required per AFI 48-148. 9.2.3.  Authorize  the  entry  and  performance  of  work  activities  involving  static  display aerospace vehicles containing radioactive material. 9.2.4.  Authorize and perform opening of display cases containing radioactive artifacts. 9.2.5.  Designate  specific  storage  areas  for  radioactive  material  with  restricted  access  (see paragraph 9.6).  Ensure all radioactive artifacts on display meet requirements at paragraph 9.3.  Restricted areas limit access to protect individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials. 9.2.6.  Verify  all  personnel  with  access  to  radioactive  storage  areas  are  briefed  on contamination  prevention, item accountability. transfer,  and  disposal  and trained  on  radioactive 9.3.  Personnel Dose Levels. 9.3.1.  Radiation  dose  levels  to  heritage  activity  visitors  and  staff  are  maintained  as  low  as reasonably achievable.  Radiological assessments are performed to ensure that radiation dose levels prescribed in AFI 48-148 are not exceeded. 9.3.1.1.  The  total  effective  dose  equivalent  to  individual  members  of  the  public  cannot exceed 100 millirem per year exclusive from background radiation. 9.3.1.2.  The dose from external sources cannot exceed 2 millirem in any one hour. 9.3.1.3.  Radiation  levels  may  be  reduced  to  acceptable  limits  by  shielding,  removing radioactive components, and/or repositioning the radioactive item(s) within the exhibit.   56  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 9.3.2.  If  staff  or  visitors  are  permitted  within  restricted  areas  (i.e.  aircraft  interiors, radioactive material storage areas, etc.), the limits continue to apply to those individuals. 9.4.  Radiation  Screens.  All  historical  property  and  RSI  are  screened  for  radioactive  material prior  to  cataloguing  (see  paragraph  6.9.2.3).    The  initial  screen  confirms  whether  radioactive material is present and determines if radiation precautions (i.e. posting, decontamination, access limitation, etc.) are needed. 9.4.1.  Initial screening is performed using an appropriate radiation detection instrument.  For items that test positive, see paragraph 9.5. 9.4.2.  Initial screenings with negative findings are annotated on one of two forms. 9.4.2.1.  If  the  item  is  historical  property  (non-aerospace  vehicle)  or  RSI  use  Radiation Screening Checklist (see Figure 9.1). 9.4.2.2.  If  the  item  is  an  aerospace  vehicle,  annotate  AF  Form  3580,  USAF  Heritage Program Aerospace  Vehicle Static  Display  Egress  and Safety Certificate, Section I, Subpart A. NOTE:  AF Form 3583s that document negative findings prior to date of this publication are acceptable and should be retained. Figure 9.1.  Radiation Screening Checklist 9.4.3.  Retain a copy in the accession or RSI file.  9.5.  Radiation Surveys.  The installation RSO or designee must survey items found to contain radioactive material during the screening process. (T-1) 9.5.1.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  installation  RSO  or  designee  to  complete  the  required survey documentation. 9.5.2.  Annotate  positive  findings  on  AF  Form  3583  or  equivalent  (see  AFI  48-148).    An equivalent  form  includes:  a  description  or  drawing  showing  each  measurement  location; measured  dose  or  contamination  levels  at  each  location;  the  type,  model  number,  serial number,  and  calibration  date  of  the  survey  instrument;  name  of  individual  performing  the survey, date and time of the survey and applicable comments. 9.5.3.  Heritage  activities  will  retain  a  copy  in  the  accession  file  and  forward  a  copy  to NMUSAF/MUC. (T-2) 9.5.4.  Surveys are performed on identified radioactive material at a minimum interval not to exceed  five  (5)  years.    Surveys  assess  the  current  condition  of  radioactive  material  and identify  whether  additional  radioactive  items  have  been  installed  or  removed.    If  all radioactive  material  has  been  removed  and  a  subsequent  documented  survey  verifies  no AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   57  residual  radiation  remains  above  standards,  aerospace  vehicles  and/or  artifacts  no  longer require a periodic survey. 9.5.5.  All  newly  acquired  aerospace  vehicles  need  an  initial  survey  (internal  and  external). The survey includes ambient radiation measurements of all accessible aerospace vehicles and any historical property containing radioactive material to ensure personnel dose limits are not exceeded.  Non-accessible aerospace vehicles include, but are not limited to, those suspended or  mounted  on  pedestals  currently  in  the  historical  collection.    If  non-accessible  aerospace vehicles are relocated or entered for maintenance, an initial survey is conducted if not already on file. 9.5.6.  Each item containing radium 226 is swipe sampled, including the surrounding area, to determine  the  extent  of  any  removable  contamination.    Note:    Do  not  take  swipe  samples from items containing unprotected radium paint. 9.5.6.1.  Removable  radium  contamination  cannot  exceed  20  disintegrations  per  minute (DPM)  per  100  square  centimeters  (dpm/100  cm2)  or,  if  less  than  100  cm2,  the  entire surface should be swiped. 9.5.6.2.  Heritage  activities  will  secure  the  area  and  contact  NMUSAF  for  guidance  on corrective actions,  if swipe results indicate removable radium contamination in excess of these limits. (T-1) 9.5.7.  Identify  items  as  having  radioactive  material  in  one  of  the  following  manners:  1)  an inconspicuous mark on the front face of the item, such as an approximately 1/4-inch red dot, containing  a  number  corresponding  to  the  item  number  on  survey  record;  2)  a  drawing identifying the component and location with corresponding number to the survey record; or 3)  a  photograph  identifying  the  component  and  location  with  corresponding  number  to  the survey  record.    Heritage  activities  will  file  the  survey  record  in  the  accession  or  aerospace vehicle files.  (T-1) 9.5.8.  At  each  point  of  entry  to  any  aerospace  vehicle  which  contains  radioactive  material, place  a  conspicuous  sign  stating,  “Contact  Installation  Radiation  Safety  Officer  Before Entering” or similar statement. 9.5.9.  EXCEPTION: A routine survey of the internal compartments of an aerospace vehicle is not required if: 9.5.9.1.  Access  to  the  aerospace  vehicle’s  internal  compartments  is  secured  from unauthorized entry.  “Secured” means a positive method is in place to prevent entry. 9.5.9.2.  Access  points  are  marked  indicating  entry  is  not  allowed  without  authorized personnel present. 9.5.10.  A routine survey of the aerospace vehicle’s exterior is still required in the interest of public safety.  In addition, for non-accessible aerospace vehicles displayed outdoors (i.e. on a pylon or pedestal), a swipe of the lowest overhanging part of the vehicle is accomplished to ensure there is no internal leakage. 9.6.  Storage.  Artifacts  containing  radioactive  material  and  not  installed  in  aerospace  vehicles are: 9.6.1.  Segregated from non-radioactive artifacts during storage.   58  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 9.6.2.  Secured to prevent unauthorized removal or entry. 9.6.3.  Area marked as containing radioactive material. 9.6.4.  Stored in a manner such that public dose limits are not exceeded (see paragraph 9.3.). 9.7.  Controls. 9.7.1.  Only an authorized Nuclear Regulatory Commission/Agreement State licensee or Air Force/Navy  Permittee  may  conduct  any  maintenance,  decontamination,  removal,  exchange, or replacement of radioactive material. 9.7.2.  The installation RSO may authorize heritage activity personnel to remove intact items from historical property or RSI. 9.7.3.  The following restrictions apply to radioactive items: 9.7.3.1.  Do not perform mechanical work or maintenance on radioactive items. 9.7.3.2.  Do  not  grind,  machine,  etch,  drill,  or  apply  any  other  physical  or  chemical process  that  changes  the  form  of  the  component  or  produces  breathable  or  ingestible particles. 9.7.3.3.  Do not open aircraft instruments, switches, circuit breakers, or other components that contain radioactive materials. 9.7.3.4.  Do  not  use  any  items  containing  radium  paint  for  “hands-on”  exhibits  (e.g. throttle/pitch quadrants, bombsights, gunsights). 9.7.3.5.  Do  not  allow  staff  or  visitors  access  to  aerospace  vehicle  interiors  or  other displays  or  items  containing  radioactive  items  unless  dose  and  contamination  levels  are less than prescribed. 9.7.3.6.  Do  not  allow  access  to  aerospace  vehicles  or  areas  containing  damaged  or leaking  radioactive  commodities  until  the  area  has  been  monitored,  assessed,  and decontaminated  if  necessary.

Disposal.  Within the United States, USAFHP aerospace vehicles are disposed of through DLA  Disposition  Services.    Because  DLA  Disposition  Services  does  not  accept  radioactive material,  heritage  activities  contact  their  installation  RSO  for  direction  on  the  removal  of  the radioactive components.  The same procedures apply to individual radioactive components (such as  excess  RSI).    If  special  conditions  require  other  processes,  coordinate  them  with  NMUSAF and AFRRAD for authorization. 9.13.  Loan  to  Civilian  Organizations.  Radioactive  material  is  removed  before  loaning historical  property  to  civilian  organizations.    Civilian  organizations  will  not  install  radioactive components in USAFHP historical property. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   61  Chapter 10 PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS 10.1.  Purpose.

Introduction.  The accountability, care, and display of munitions and firearms at heritage activities involve additional  responsibilities and obligations.  Activities are advised to  carefully consider these before acquiring such items.  Heritage activities must: 11.1.1.  Have  a  valid  requirement  to  acquire  and  display  firearms,  conventional  munitions, and nuclear munitions as reflected in their strategic plan. (T-1) 11.1.2.  Coordinate  requests,  displays,  and  disposition  of  nuclear  type  trainer  display  units with  AFNWC/A4/7  Det  5  via  NMUSAF/MUC  and  MAJCOM/HO  IAW  AFI  21-201, Conventional  Munitions  Management,  and  AFI  21-204,  Nuclear  Weapons  Maintenance Procedures.  Displayed units will be unclassified and will not be altered while in possession of the heritage activity. (T-1) 11.1.3.  Not display Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel; if discovered, report and disposition IAW AFI 20-110, Nuclear Weapons-Related Materiel Management. (T-1) 11.2.  Munitions.  All  USAFHP  munitions  (e.g.  bombs,  rockets,  missiles,  ammunition,  flares, and other pyrotechnics) must be rendered inert.  Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel or a qualified and authorized inspector are the authority on all matters related to munitions safety in accordance with AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program. 11.2.1.  EOD  personnel  or  a  qualified  and  authorized  inspector  will  inspect  and  certify  all munitions as inert prior to acceptance by the heritage activity. (T-0). Written confirmation of the inert status accompanies the munitions at the time of acceptance (see Para 6.9.1.4.3). 11.2.2.  In  instances  when  confirmation  of  inert  status  is  not  available  (i.e.  artifacts  already present  in  heritage  activity  collections  and  not  certified  inert)  the  following  actions  are needed: 11.2.2.1.  All  munitions  without  a  certification  of  inspection  and  verification  of  inert status  are  considered  to  be  live.    Immediately  contact  EOD  or  qualified  and  authorized personnel  serving  the  installation  to  inspect  and  store  live  or  suspected  live  munitions.  Suspect  munitions  are  held  in  an  approved  separate,  secured  storage  area,  as  per  EOD guidance, until inspected. 11.2.2.2.  Heritage activities must follow EOD personnel’s direction during a response to an inspection and verification request. (T-1) 11.2.2.3.  Heritage  activities  must  document  munitions  removed  for  inspection  by  EOD or qualified and authorized personnel on AF Form 1297.  (T-1) 11.2.3.  Heritage  activities  must  file  the  written  certification  in  the  item’s  accession  folder and forward a copy to NMUSAF/MUC, once the item is certified as inert.  (T-1) 11.2.4.  If  items  cannot  be  made  inert,  EOD  or  qualified  and  authorized  personnel  will dispose of them by approved methods. (T-1). To reconcile item records after disposal, EOD or  qualified  and  authorized  personnel  will  provide  a  signed  destruction  certificate  for  any AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   69  munitions destroyed. (T-1). Heritage activities must forward a copy of the signed destruction certificate to NMUSAF/MUC to facilitate deaccession actions (see Chapter 6). (T-1) 11.2.5.  HPC will handle and store inert munitions with appropriate equipment and containers as per AFI 31-101. (T-1) 11.2.6.  Display  munitions  with  period  correct  display  color  codes,  bands,  and  marking symbols in accordance with Technical Order 11A-1-53, General Instruction For Ammunition Color Coding, Identification of Empty And Inert Loaded Ammunition Items And Components, And Assignment Of Version Numbers To Training And Dummy Ammunition Items.  Include standard empty or inert lettering, markings, or decals that identify the munitions status but do not  detract  from  aesthetic  display.    Current  color  coding  systems  do  not  apply  to  historical display  munitions  as  noted  in  MIL-STD-709D,  Department  of  Defense  Design  Criteria Standard,  Ammunition  Color  Coding.    Do  not  stamp,  engrave,  alter,  or  otherwise permanently mark munitions in any way that would affect historical integrity. 11.3.  Firearms.  All  firearms  are  kept  in  a  functional  state  in  order  to  preserve  their  historical integrity  and  educational  and  aesthetic  values.    Non-functional  firearms  are  not  required  to  be rendered functional. 11.3.1.  Display of Firearms. 11.3.1.1.  Heritage  activities  will  take  maximum  advantage  of  utilizing  commercially available replica firearms in exhibits and on aircraft. (T-1). Specifically, in exhibits where only generic specimens are needed (e.g. aircraft turret installations) or where firearms are not integral to the story, the use of replicas is suggested. 11.3.1.2.  Complete  firearms  should  not  be  utilized  for  internal  aircraft  installations.  Instead, the use of machine gun and cannon jacket/barrel assemblies is recommended in order  to  present  a  complete  external  appearance.    However,  complete  firearms  may  be used  if  their  physical  size  and  access  restrict  easy  removal  and  may  also  be  visually inventoried (i.e. 20mm gun systems and greater). 11.3.1.3.  Do  not  display  firearms  under  30mm  outdoors.    Use  replicas  or  non-receiver firearm components, barrels or barrel jackets to meet display requirements. Consult on a case-by-case  basis  with  NMUSAF/MUC  about  security  provisions  and  exhibit requirements  for  ground-mounted  crew-served  firearms  (e.g.  anti-aircraft  firearms) displayed outdoors. 11.3.1.4.  Firearms to be placed on exhibit are rendered temporarily inoperable, with the following exceptions for antique or unique firearms.  Only NMUSAF determines whether a firearm meets the criteria for these exceptions.  NMUSAF/MUC will provide heritage activities a copy of its decision. 11.3.1.4.1.  Antique  firearms  manufactured  before  1898  and  not  requiring  metallic cartridges. 11.3.1.4.2.  Unique  firearms  whose  disassembly  might  damage  them  or  whose ammunition, links, or drums needed for functioning are not available. 11.3.1.5.  Except  for  antique  or  unique  firearms  as  noted  in  11.3.1.4.,  all  firearms  are rendered temporarily inoperable by removing firing pins,  internal  mechanisms, or parts.  A serial numbered firearm receiver or frame constitutes a firearm and is subject to these   70  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 requirements.  In order to preserve their historical integrity and educational and aesthetic value, no further permanent actions should be performed.  Clearly identify and securely store  any  parts  removed.    Heritage  activities  will  ensure  historical  firearms  are  not  cut, welded, defaced, or permanently altered.  (T-0) 11.3.1.5.1.  The  essential  components  removed  from  firearms  to  render  them inoperable  are  tagged  with  the  firearm’s  serial  number.    Etching  a  firearm’s  serial number on any removed part is prohibited.  The removed items are stored in a locked container  in  a  secure  area  away  from  the  arms  storage  facility.    Electronically  fired weapon systems 20mm or greater are considered inoperable once removed from their power source. 11.3.1.6.  Secure firearms on display to prevent easy removal.  Use security fasteners or discrete cable locks to secure firearms displayed as a component of a larger system (e.g. an aircraft turret).  Security measures should be inconspicuous so as not to detract from the display's aesthetic appearance. 11.3.1.6.1.  Provide IDS protection for all exhibit cases displaying firearms.  Firearms that have been certified as being permanently non-functional by installation security forces are exempt from requirement to be displayed in IDS protected cases.  Heritage activities  will  maintain  such  certifications to MAJCOM/HO and NMUSAF/MUC. (T-1) locally  and  forward  copies 11.3.1.6.2.  Attach  larger  portable  firearms  on  open  display  to  display  stands,  the floor,  or  other  fixture.    Heritage  activities  will  ensure  IDS  protection  is  in  place  for facilities housing crew-served (i.e. requiring two or more people to operate) and other large firearms.  (T-1) 11.4.  Access to Controlled Area. 11.4.1.  Limit  routine  access  by  personnel  to  firearms  storage  facilities  or  authorized container(s)  to  the  least  practical  number  of  responsible  persons  designated  by  the  AFFM Director or HPC.  Heritage activities will post the names and duty positions of these persons inside the arms storage facility. (T-1) 11.4.2.  Establish  a  two-person  rule  for  access  to  firearms  storage  container(s)  and/or facility(s).    Two  authorized  persons  (one  of  which  may  be  a  heritage  activity  volunteer) should  be  present  during  any  operation  that  affords  access  to  these  container(s)  and/or facility(s).  Heritage  activities will establish appropriate lock and key  control procedures in accordance with AFI 31-101 to preclude defeat of the two-person rule concept. (T-1) 11.5.  Firearms in Storage. 11.5.1.  Heritage activities will keep only those firearms which are identified in the heritage activity’s approved exhibit plan.  (T-1) 11.5.2.  Heritage  activities  will  store  all  firearms  with  the  same  level  of  security,  in accordance with AFI 31-101, whether inoperable, welded, or demilitarized. (T-1) 11.5.3.  Keep stored firearms within locked racks, cabinets, or banded containers with seals.  Aircraft and ground weapon systems greater than 30mm and not man-portable may be stored openly (i.e. not in a locked container) given their physical size. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   71  11.5.4.  Exercise care to ensure that racks, cabinets, and containers are of the correct size and material with sufficient padding to prevent damage to the firearms. 11.5.5.  Heritage  activities  will  ensure  firearms  are  reasonably  accessible  for  inventory, conservation, inspection, or removal.  (T-2) 11.5.6.  Areas where firearms are stored are designated and posted as controlled areas.  Such posting is visible at eye level when possible. 11.6.  Firearms Inventory Requirements. 11.6.1.  Maintain a current inventory, by serial number.  All firearms, with or without serial numbers,  are  marked  with  an  accession  number.    Numbers  should  be  easy  to  find,  legible, and placed on the firearm in a position so as not to interfere with the display or study value of the firearm. 11.6.2.  Inventory firearms as follows: 11.6.2.1.  Conduct  daily visual  checks  on  all  exhibits  containing  firearms  for  tampering or theft. 11.6.2.2.  Inspect  weekly  the  firearm  storage  area  to  ensure  that  all  locks  and  seals  are intact.  Heritage activities will notify installation security forces immediately, if any rack, cabinet, or container is found damaged or tampered with. (T-1) 11.6.2.3.  Heritage activities will inventory firearms stored in banded or sealed containers by type and accession number each time the seal is broken. (T-1) 11.6.2.4.  Seals  used  for  banded  racks,  cabinets,  and  containers  are  controlled  with limited access. 11.6.2.5.  Conduct  an  annual  inventory  of  all  firearms  by  type  and  accession  number.  Document inventory results in AFMATS.  Heritage activities will notify NMUSAF/MUC of completed inventory if they do not have an AFMATS account.  (T-1) 11.7.  Department of Defense Small Arms Serialization Program (DODSASP). 11.7.1.  DODSASP provides for a continuous oversight  of firearms, by serial  number, from procurement  through  demilitarization  and  disposal.    It  is  designed  to  give  investigative agencies,  within  72  hours,  the  identification  of  the  last  DoD  activity  accountable  for  a specific serial-numbered firearm. 11.7.2.  NMUSAF/MUC  maintains  DODSASP  responsibilities  for  the  entire  heritage program.   Heritage  activities  must  report  all  firearm  acquisitions  immediately  to NMUSAF/MUC. (T-0) 11.7.3.  Heritage  activities  will  register  all  modern  firearms  with  serial  numbers  with  the DoD  Central  Registry  using  DODSASP,  in  accordance  with  DoD  4000.25.2-M  Military Standard  Transaction  Reporting  and  Accounting  Procedures  (MILSTRAP),  Chapter  12.7.6. and Do4000.25-M, Defense Logistics Management System, Vol 2, Chapter 18.  (T-0) 11.8.  Facilities.  Follow structural  standards in  DoD 5100.76-M,  Physical  Security of  Sensitive Conventional  Arms,  Ammunition,  and  Explosives,  for  new  construction  or  modification  of facilities  for  storage  of  museum  firearms.    Modify  existing  facilities  accordingly.    Heritage activities  must  comply  with  approved  plans  for  future  development  and  new  construction   72  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 programs  unless  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  of  1966  precludes  compliance  when upgrading buildings.

Purpose  and  Authority.  In  accordance  with  10  USC  §2572,  the  USAF  may  make available  for  loan  to  certified  civilian  entities  condemned  or  obsolete  combat  materiel.    Within the Air Force, such materiel is loaned through either the Static Display Program or the Civilian Museum Loan Program.  These loan programs have three goals.  They seek to bring Air Force history  and  heritage  to  a  wider,  civilian  audience.    They  also  serve  to  assist  organizations qualified  under  10  USC  §2572  in  fostering  a  deeper  appreciation  and  interest  in  aerospace history,  education  and  technology.    Lastly,  these  loan  programs  seek  to  memorialize  the accomplishments  of  American  Airmen.    NMUSAF  has  been  delegated  the  sole  authority  and responsibility  by  the  SECAF  to  administer  loans  to  civilian  entities  in  accordance  with  the provisions of 10 USC §2572. 12.2.  Qualification Requirements and Application. 12.2.1.  Requesting  civilian  entities  must  meet  specific  requirements  to  be  considered  for either  civilian  loan  program.    Civilian  entities  apply  to  participate  in  the  Static  Display Program or Civilian Museum Loan Program by contacting the NMUSAF. 12.2.2.  Military  organizations  and/or  commanders  will  not  initiate  or  negotiate  any discussions with  civilian entities seeking any historical  property  for display.  (T-1). Military organizations and/or commanders must direct all such requests to NMUSAF. (T-0) 12.3.  Availability and Condition of Property.  Historical property is made available for loan to civilian  entities  after  the  needs  of  official  military  requesters  are  met.    Classified  material, weapons,  radioactive  components  or  items  that  might  pose  a  safety  hazard  to  the  public  are removed prior to loan.  Certain components from aerospace vehicles needed to meet operational requirements of the USAF are removed however the vehicle is externally complete. 12.4.  Static Display Program. 12.4.1.  Eligibility.  The following civilian entities are eligible to apply for loans through the Static Display Program.  For purposes of this instruction, they are collectively referred to as “civilian organizations”. 12.4.1.1.  A municipal corporation, county, or other political subdivision of a State. 12.4.1.2.  A servicemen’s monument association. 12.4.1.3.

Only  veterans’  organizations  may  receive  support  from military organizations. 12.4.2.2.  Civilian  organizations  bear  continuing  responsibility  for  any  loaned  property including  insurance  coverage  and  maintenance  costs  (e.g.  periodic  painting,  repair  of damage,  and  day  to  day  care)  as  per  the  terms  of  the  loan  agreement.    All  repairs, restoration  work,  additions  or  upgrades  performed  on  loaned  property  become  the property  of  the  U.S.  Government.    Supporting  commanders  and  heritage  activities  are prohibited from incurring any expense to restore, display, or maintain artifacts, including aerospace vehicles on loan to civilian organizations. 12.4.2.3.  Loaned  aerospace  vehicles  cannot  be  flown  or  restored  to  flying  condition under  any  circumstances.    Failure  to  observe  this  condition  results  in  the  vehicle’s immediate repossession  by NMUSAF, at  the requestor’s expense, and possible criminal prosecution. 12.4.2.4.  No  cargo  (DoD  category  A)  aircraft  are  made  available  for  loan  in  the  Static Display Program. 12.4.3.  Availability of Property.

Introduction.  The USAFHP recognizes the potential for heritage activities programs and outreach to  educate and inform visitors, increase awareness of and support for the activity, and promote  the  broader  mission  and  history  of  the  USAF.    Programming  and  outreach,  whether through  events,  publications  or  an  online  presence,  provide  excellent  opportunities  to  extend  a heritage  activity’s  mission  by  expanding  on  a  particular  exhibit,  artifact,  historical  person  or event.  They also serve a vital role in preparing visitors for on-site visits to heritage activities and maintaining a relationship with those visitors beyond the visit. 13.2.  Programming. 13.2.1.  Heritage  activities  are  encouraged  to  further  their  mission  through  educational programs  and  activities  such  as  lectures,  guest  speakers,  multimedia  presentations  and programs targeted toward both military and civilian audiences. Particular attention should be given  to  sponsoring  special  recognition  programs  related  to  important  or  historic  Air  Force people, events and dates. 13.2.2.  Heritage activities that plan, produce, host or sponsor programs and events or partner with other organizations to offer such programs are encouraged to develop written guidance (including  but  not  limited  to  OIs  and  supplements  to  existing  AFIs).  This  guidance  defines what  events  or  activities  are  authorized  (e.g.  mission  related,  public  or  private,  military  or civilian) as well as how events are planned and conducted. Such guidance references existing applicable  laws  and  statutes,  DoD  guidance,  AFIs  and  local  installation  policies  and procedures and be coordinated with installation legal counsel. 13.2.3.  Heritage  activities  will  inform,  engage  and  coordinate  programs  with  their  base, installation or unit Public Affairs Office.  (T-3) 13.3.  Publications.  Written publications provide an excellent opportunity for heritage activities to support and promote their mission, function or specific project.  Publication types may include but are not limited to general information brochures or rack cards, newsletters, exhibit or gallery guides,  educational  resources  and  event  programs.    Heritage  activities  are  advised  to  keep  the following in mind before producing and disseminating any publication: 13.3.1.  Coordinate  with  installation,  base  or  unit  Public  Affairs  Office.    Determine  if  any support can be provided in the design, production or promotion of publications. 13.3.2.  Ensure  publications  contain  accurate  information,  project  a  professional  look  and design,  and  strive  for  clear,  easy  to  understand  language  that  effectively  communicates intended messages.  Publications should be in good taste and reflect favorably on the USAF. 13.3.3.  Consult  guidance  in  Attachment  A4.1  regarding  exhibit  labels  when  drafting publications.    Consider  consulting  with  NMUSAF  or  other  heritage  activities  that  have produced similar publications for additional guidance and lessons learned. 13.4.  Websites.  Heritage  activities  are  encouraged  to  establish  and  maintain  a  Web  presence where  possible  and  appropriate.    This  is  especially  important  for  activities  that  are  open  to  the public and support any kind of public programming (i.e. events, educational programming). AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   77  13.4.1.  Heritage  activities  desiring  a  Web  presence  supported  by  their  base  network  work with their installation’s Public Affairs Office to establish Air Force Public Web pages/sites in accordance  with  AFIs  35-107,  Public  Web  Communications  and  33-129,  Web  Management and Internet Use. 13.4.2.  In  some  instances  a  heritage  activity’s  PO  may  wish  to  establish  a  website maintained by a commercial internet provider (i.e. a “.com”) and thus operating completely independent of installation or DoD networks.  Such sites are funded and maintained solely by the PO.  All such privately managed websites present accurate and current information about the heritage activity, be in good taste, and reflect favorably on the USAF and DoD.  WALTER A.

Overview.  All  USAF  heritage  activities  will  develop  and  maintain  certain  fundamental documentation  for  the  effective  management  of  their  organization.  (T-1).  These  should  be routinely  reviewed  and  updated  as  necessary  and  are  submitted  biennially  for  review  and coordination  by  the  supporting  commander  and  MAJCOM/HO.      The  complexity  of  these documents is dependent on the size and scope of the USAFHP activity. A2.2.  Mission  and  Collection  Policy  Statements.  The USAFHP  and MAJCOM/HOs rely on mission statements to ensure artifacts and other resources go to the proper activity, and that the USAFHP represents the full heritage of the Air Force. A2.2.1.  All  heritage  activities  must  have  approved  mission  statements.  (T-1).  A  mission statement  concisely  states,  in  writing,  the  purpose  of  the  heritage  activity  and  the  aspect  of Air  Force  history  that  the  activity  addresses.  The  missions  of  all  USAF  heritage  activities collectively express the Air Force's heritage and preserve its material culture. A2.2.1.1.  The  MAJCOM/HO  approves  mission  statements  or  may  modify  them  by assigning  a  secondary  mission  and  ensures  mission  statements  avoid  unnecessary duplication, wisely using Air Force resources. A2.2.2.  All  heritage  activities  must  also  have  a  collection  policy.  (T-1).  The  collection policy  is  based  on  the  mission  statement.    It  outlines  the  historical  property  required  to support the mission statement and what is accepted by the heritage activity. A2.2.2.1.  The  collection  policy  defines  what  the  heritage  activity  will  collect  and  how each item is related to the mission statement. (T-1). A2.2.2.2.  This  policy  can  be  general  (by  class)  or  narrow  (by  specific  type  or  model), depending on the space and resources available.  It is also recommended that the policy be defined by the classification categories used in the NMUSAF Data Dictionary. A2.3.  Plans.  Planning  is  a  deliberate,  institutionalized  process  that  links  scope,  mission,  and priorities to budgetary and operational decisions.  Its purpose is to enable an organization to be flexible  enough  to  adapt  to  the  ever-changing  environment,  both  internally  and  externally.   Planning  looks  at  how  a  heritage  activity  can  best  advance  itself  by  tying  specific  goals  to  its core  competencies  and  implementing  doctrine.    Effective  planning  can  pull  together  a  diverse organization,  communicate  clear  objectives  and  organizational  values,  and  achieve  the  creative integration of all resources. A2.3.1.  Concept  and  development.    Heritage  activities  will  develop  plans  and  determine measurement and monitoring throughout the plan’s period of implementation and coordinate with their supporting commander.  (T-1) A2.3.2.  Strategic Plan.  Strategic plans should take into consideration higher level guidance and include the following elements: A2.3.2.1.  A  mission  statement  that  captures  the  particular  purpose  and  focus  of  the heritage activity.   84  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 A2.3.2.2.  Specific  priorities  that  encompass  broad  areas  of  concern  in  order  of importance. A2.3.2.3.  Goals that capture more specifically the intent and organizational change that represent how the mission is realized. A2.3.2.4.  Objectives and/or initiatives that detail specific action(s) for accomplishing the goals.  These  are  specific  targets  and  activities  developed  on  a  schedule  and  are performance–based. A2.4.  Plan  Elements.  Heritage  activity  plans  have  six  elements,  each  of  which  contributes  to the  strategic  plan:    Exhibits,  Collections,  Facilities  Utilization,  Programs  and  Outreach, Financial, and Manpower. A2.4.1.  Exhibits.  This element explains current and future presentation of artifacts, with the following components: A2.4.1.1.  A storyline that has a clear, concise statement of what topic(s) the heritage activity presents. A2.4.1.2.  An  exhibit  concept  that  details  how  the  story  is  presented  to  the  activity’s audience. A2.4.1.3.  A multi-year exhibit schedule that provides a calendar of design, development, installation, and maintenance. A2.4.1.4.  A  list  of  historical  property,  photographs,  documents,  and  museum  support articles  (MSA)  needed  based  on  the  exhibit  concept  and  schedule.    Take  into consideration  the  amount  of  space  (linear,  vertical  and  cubic)  each  exhibit  or  display requires. A2.4.2.  Collections.    The  collection  element  provides  a  framework  that  heritage  activities can  use  to  determine,  evaluate,  and  meet  mission  needs.    In  its  most  basic  form  it  is  a carefully considered list  of historical property needed or desired to support the presentation of mission-specific stories.  It should include the following components: A2.4.2.1.  The  heritage  activity’s  audience(s)  and  how  their  needs  are  served  by  the collections. A2.4.2.2.  A  “needs  assessment”  based  on  a  review  of  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of the  existing  collections  and  their  relation  to  the  exhibit  plan.    This  should  discuss  the significance of all historical property in the heritage activity’s custody and how it applies to the exhibit plan. A2.4.2.3.  Manpower  and  budget  resources  available  and  projected  to  support  existing and desired collections. A2.4.2.4.  Collection  priorities  based  on  both  realistic  and  desired  needs.  Collection priorities should take into consideration both the acquisition of desired historical property and the disposition of historical property that is excess to need. A2.4.3.  Facility  Utilization.    All  heritage  activities  will  determine  their  facility  needs  to perform their mission. (T-1). Consult installation civil engineering for applicable guidance on detailed  definitions,  information,  and  specifications  concerning  environmental,  safety,  and AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   85  security.  Heritage activities should take into consideration the following facilities planning factors: A2.4.3.1.  Space assessment: A2.4.3.1.1.  Number of occupants.  This includes office and administrative space for the heritage activity personnel, volunteers, supporting private organization (PO), and contractor personnel. A2.4.3.1.2.  Work  spaces,  including  but  not  limited  to  artifact  receiving,  processing, conservation  and  storage,  reference  materials  and  library,  exhibit  preparation,  and fabrication. A2.4.3.1.3.  Public  access  spaces,  including  but  not  limited  to  exhibit,  display,  and assembly  (i.e.,  special  events,  education,  etc.).    This  factor  should  also  reflect  the number of expected visitors. A2.4.3.2.  Facility  condition(s),  including  structure  and  building  core  systems  (structure size  and  loading,  plumbing,  heating,  ventilation,  and  cooling,  fire  protection,  electrical, lighting, telecommunications, security systems). A2.4.3.3.  Site  access  condition(s)  including  landscape,  walkways,  parking  and  general outdoor lighting, and security criteria. A2.4.3.4.  Priorities  for  sustainment,  repair,  and  modernization.  Facility  improvements and repair requirements become part of the installation’s financial plan. A2.4.3.5.  Long-range  capital  improvements  to  include  new  facilities,  major  repairs, environmental,  security,  and  resource  protection  improvements.  New  facilities  drive  a heritage activity’s PO fund-raising efforts. A2.4.4.  Programs  and  Outreach.    Heritage  activities  should  identify  special  events  or activities  that  may  expand  on  a  particular  exhibit,  artifact,  historical  person  or  event.  Consideration  is  given  to  the  resources  necessary  to  support  such  events  including  but  not limited to: A2.4.4.1.  Educational activities for military or civilian audiences, such as lectures, tours, demonstrations, or multimedia activities. A2.4.4.2.  Events which may include but are not limited to military ceremonies and other related, official quality of life activities. A2.4.4.3.  Printed publications for distribution. A2.4.4.4.  Electronic and online outreach that contact larger community and stakeholders. A2.4.5.  Financial. A2.4.5.1.  Based  on  the  requirements  identified  in  the  exhibit,  collection,  facilities utilization,  and  programs  and  outreach  elements,  heritage  activities  submit  a  budget  to supporting  commander  that  outlines  funding  required  for  facility  repair,  improvement, modernization,  exhibit  construction,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA) modifications, etc.   86  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 A2.4.5.2.  Determine  which  items  can  be  accomplished  by  installation  civil  engineering and which can be accomplished through the activity’s PO. A2.4.5.3.  Submit  major  construction  requirements  and  plans  to  the  PO  for  inclusion  in their financial and fundraising plans. A2.4.5.4.  Include  Operations  and  Maintenance  (O&M)  recurring  and  non-recurring requirements  in  the  organization’s  financial  plan  (FINPLAN),  including  supplies, equipment, and services of a recurring and non-recurring nature. A2.4.6.  Manpower:    Staffing  should  meet  mission  requirements.    The  staffing  element should contain: A2.4.6.1.  An  evaluation  of  the  heritage  activity’s  current  manpower,  both  paid  and unpaid. A2.4.6.2.  An assessment of future manpower needs based on the other elements detailed in the strategic plan. A2.4.6.3.  Projections for the education, training, and development needs of all staff.  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   87  Attachment 3 USAFHP ETHICS STATEMENT A3.1.  Introduction.  The  USAFHP  ethics  statement  identifies  those  general  parameters  within which USAFHP employees and volunteers operate.  The USAFHP exists to serve both the USAF and  the  public.    It  functions  as  an  arm  of  the  USAF  and  as  such  must  comply  with  the  Joint Ethics  Regulation  (JER)  DoD  5500.7-R,  existing  AFIs,  and  established  procedures  in  such operational  areas  as  financial  management,  personnel  matters,  and  procurement  of  supplies,  as well  as  within  established  USAF  requirements  governing  personal  conduct.    In  the  event  any aspect  of  this  code  conflicts  with  any  of  the  above,  the  latter  takes  precedence.    Otherwise, USAFHP staff should be guided by the following: A3.1.1.  Conduct  business  in  a  legal  and  moral  manner,  and  avoid  even  the  slightest appearance  of  impropriety  such  as  the  use  of  one’s  position  or  access  gained  from  that position  for  personal  gain.    The  USAFHP  is  subject  to  scrutiny  not  just  by  the  USAF,  but also by our professional peers and the public. A3.1.2.  Be  guided  by  both  applicable  DoD  and  USAF  regulations  and  museum  ethics generally accepted among professionals within the museum community. A3.1.3.  Do  not  compete  with  the  USAFHP  or  give  the  appearance  of  doing  so.  Do  not pursue a collecting interest during leisure time if there is a potential for a conflict of interest with official duties. A3.1.4.  Do  not  accept  gifts,  discounts,  or  other  favors  from  parties  seeking  to  do  business with the USAFHP.  Exceptions to the above are set forth in the JER DoD 5500.7-R. A3.1.5.  Do  not  prepare  appraisals  for  donors  or  potential  donors.    The  only  permissible appraisals are for internal use or for other non-profit institutions. A3.1.6.  Do not speak on behalf of the USAFHP unless so authorized. A3.1.7.  Recognize  and  strive  to  maintain  the  goal  of  service  to  the  visiting  public  and  the dissemination of knowledge. A3.1.8.  Manage  all  artifacts  placed  in  the  care  of  the  USAFHP  in  a  manner  that  assures long-term preservation.  Do not use historical property in a consumptive manner. A3.1.9.  Maintain all official records in an accurate, thorough, and orderly manner. A3.1.10.  Accept  only  those  items  that  meet  the  heritage  activity’s  scope  of  collection statement. A3.1.11.  Make  the  collections  available  for  legitimate  examination  and  research  by  people outside  the  USAFHP  within  limitations  of  available  resources,  preservation  of  the  items involved, purpose of the research, and other considerations. A3.1.12.  Ensure  the  integrity  of  reproductions  and  replicas  and  permanently  identify  those items as such. A3.1.13.  Only acquire artifacts with clear title. A3.1.14.  Appreciate the fact that the USAFHP is holding the National Historical Collection in trust for the benefit of future generations.   88  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 A3.1.15.  Care for and interpret artifacts with sensitivity to their cultural origin. A3.1.16.  Strive to present USAF history to the public in an accurate and unbiased manner. A3.2.  Training.  All  civilian  and  military  heritage  activity  employees  (to  include  HPCs  and volunteers)  must  complete  the  Museum  Ethics  Awareness  Training  annually.  (T-0).  NMUSAF maintains  the  training  site,  develops  instructions/procedures  for  compliance,  and  notifies MAJCOM/HOs when training is  due.   MAJCOM/HOs will notify individual heritage  activities of  the  training  requirement,  including  new  employees,  and  ensure  they  receive  instructions  for completing the training.  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   89  Attachment 4 EXHIBIT REQUIREMENTS A4.1.  Exhibit Design and Planning.  Design concepts pertain to the approved exhibit storyline, take  into  consideration  location  and  support  facilities,  and  respect  the  artifacts  to  be  displayed.  Overall design should be balanced, logical, and aesthetically pleasing.  Address questions about exhibit  design  or  construction  through  the  MAJCOM/HO  to  the  NMUSAF  Exhibits  Division (NMUSAF/MUE). A4.1.1.  The  exhibit  script  should  strive  to  appeal  to  a  wide  range  of  audience  interest  and sophistication. A4.1.2.  Use clear, concise, and readable language when writing exhibit scripts and labels. A4.1.3.  Heritage  activities  will  display  artifacts  that  are  in  stable  condition  and  of  good overall quality.  (T-2) A4.1.4.  Ensure  use  of  standard  museum  conservation  methods  for  artifact  support  mounts. Refer  questions  about  designs  for  artifact  support  mounts  and  mounting  through  the MAJCOM/HO to the NMUSAF Conservator. A4.1.5.  Heritage  activities  will  not  display  original  photographs,  archival  documents,  or records.  Use color laser or photographic copies instead. (T-2) A4.1.6.  Heritage  activities  will  display  artworks,  graphic  elements,  photographs,  and  the exhibit  cases  that  house  them  at  heights  easily  viewed  by  visitors  of  all  ages,  including visitors with disabilities.  (T-0) A4.1.7.  Heritage activities will use electronic or typeset systems to create exhibit titles, text, captions,  labels,  and  signs.  (T-3)    Strive  to  create  a  uniform  look  for  all  exhibit  text  and graphics.  Consider creating an exhibit label template. A4.1.8.  Heritage  activities  will  use  appropriately  contrasting  font  color(s),  sizes  and  type styles that are clear and bold enough to be easily read from a visitor's viewing position. (T-3) A4.1.9.  Heritage  activities  will  not  use  hand-printed,  hand-lettered,  typewriter  produced  or calligraphy methods for exhibit titles, text, captions, labels, or signs. (T-3) A4.2.  Exhibit Case Requirements.  Exhibit cases are well constructed of inert, flame-retardant quality materials and adhesives that inhibit entrance of vermin and dust. Heritage activities will address  corrective  action  for  cases  not  meeting  the  requirements  noted  below  in  exhibit  plans. (T-1). A4.2.1.  Woods  used  in  the  exterior  construction  of  display  cases  are  of  high  quality hardwoods,  poplar,  pine,  or  exterior  grade  plywood.    Any  wood  used  on  the  interior  of display  cases  is  covered  with  laminate  such  as  Formica  or  sealed  by  a  double  coat  of  high quality water-based polyurethane. A4.2.2.  All  cases  have  concealed  locking  mechanisms  or  security  head  screws  to  ensure security.        Doors  over  three  feet  have  a  minimum  of  two  locks  or  a  double  locking mechanism.   90  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 A4.2.3.  All interior surfaces are to be of inert, non-reactive, museum safe materials such as natural  vegetable  fibers  like  cotton,  flax,  hemp,  jute,  linen,  and  muslin.    Natural  protein substances such as silk may also be utilized.  Synthetic materials that may be safely utilized include  acrylic  glues,  acrylic  paints,  water-based  polyurethane  sealants,  Formica  type laminates, polyester, polypropylene, nylon, and acrylic fabrics and polyethylene foams such as  ethafoam,  microfoam,  and  volara  2.1.    Any  paper  products  used  are  acid-free  such  as 100% cotton rag board, Bainbridge “ALPHAMAT” and Gator Foam Board. A4.2.4.  If the case is already constructed of inert materials, the interior surfaces do not have to  be  painted.    Allow  freshly  sealed  exhibit  cases  2  to  3  weeks  to  ventilate  harmful  vapors before installing artifacts. A4.2.5.  When  possible,  and  in  all  new  installations  or  when  displaying  sensitive  or significant  objects,  use  quarter-inch  U/V  filtering  acrylic  glazing  exclusively  for  case vitrines.  Where  glazing  surfaces  join  at  an  angle,  bond  and  round  the  edges  to  prevent  the insertion of a pry tool, and secure them to the cabinet base or to the wall.  UF-3 (Rohm and Haas)  or  equivalent  U/V  light  absorbing  poly-acrylic  (Plexiglas)  should  be  used  for  the glazing  of  the  cases  and  as  a  U/V  light  filtering  barrier  between  the  light  source  and  the objects.  Glazing materials are of glass, acrylics (Plexiglas), or polycarbonates (Lexan). A4.2.6.  Install U/V sleeves on fluorescent lights and utilize neutral density filtering film to reduce lux levels to acceptable range of 15 foot-candles or 150 lux. A4.2.7.  Ventilate exhibit cases as needed with, for example, 1- to 3-inch diameter ventilation holes.  All holes have a louver and cotton baffle to filter dust and vermin.  Install one 1-inch diameter hole per every  8 cubic feet  of case space.  Spaces larger than 8  cubic feet  require one  ventilation  hole  with  up  to  a  3-inch  diameter  or  multiple  well-spaced  1-inch  diameter holes.  Baffling is maintained and changed periodically.  In certain instances, ventilation fans may  be  used.  Any  case  modifications  needed  should  be  agreed  upon  during  the  exhibit design phase. A4.2.8.  Proper museum-safe techniques and materials are used when mounting objects.  The use  of  screws,  nails,  pins,  staples,  aquarium  cement,  double-sided  tape,  and  other  adhesive tape  products  is  prohibited.    Contact  NMUSAF  Conservator  for  additional  guidance  if needed. A4.2.9.  Fasten  case  tops  securely  to  the  glazing  or  to  the  cabinet  base  with  screws  that cannot  be  reached  from  the  front.    It  cannot  be  possible  to  lift  the  top  or  to  slide  anything beneath it into the case. A4.2.10.  Set  hinges  for  case  doors  on  the  inside  when  possible.    It  cannot  be  possible  to reach  the  hinge  screws  from  outside  the  case.    Hinged  openings  have  all  hinge  butts concealed or pins spot welded, or use a comparable security measure. A4.2.11.  Many materials are not recommended for use in the construction of exhibit cases or within  the  cases  themselves.    Common  examples  include  the  following:    sulfur  containing items  such  as  wool,  wool  felt,  leather,  rubber,  rayon  fabrics,  polystyrene,  and  vinyl;  un-sealed  hardwoods  or  interior  grade  plywood,  fiberboard  or  particle  board  which  all  have formaldehydes  in  their  adhesives;  polyvinyl  chloride  (PVC)  containing  plastics  such  as Sintra,  and  Kydex  which  “out-gas”  hydrogen  chloride;  polyvinyl  acetate  containing  glues, paints, and plastics which release acetic acid;  paper products which are not acid-free such as AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   91  cardboard,  non-acid-free  matte  board,  Masonite,  and  other  acid  containing  wallboard products. A4.2.12.  Security  case  standards.    Build  cases  for  historical  property  requiring  IDS protection  to  the  same  specifications  as  standard  cases  with  the  following  additional requirements: A4.2.12.1.  Heritage activities will construct the tops, backs, sides, and bottoms of wall-mounted  cases  of  3/4-inch  exterior  grade  plywood  or  a  material  of  equal  or  greater strength.  (T-2) A4.2.12.2.  Heritage activities will construct the viewing surfaces of cases with panels of at  least  1/4-inch  thick  plate  safety  glass,  transparent  acrylic  plastic,  or  transparent polycarbonate plastic. (T-2) A4.2.12.3.  Security  cases  should  have  at  least  one  alarm  end  device  (such  as  a microswitch or magnetic contactor) between the artifact and its mount or the base of the case to detect tampering or removal.  This device may be supplemented with any one or a combination of the following to secure significant artifacts:  magnetic contact sensors on all  case  doors;  microswitches  or  magnetic  contact  sensors  under  all  glazing;  vibration sensors in each case, preferably on the glazing. A4.2.12.4.  When  possible,  position  alarmed  exhibit  cases  so  that  museum  staff  can  see them at all times.  Do not install exhibits that allow unobserved access or tampering.  If unavoidable (e.g. structural columns, load bearing walls, etc.), consider using additional security measures such as surveillance cameras. Heritage activities will conduct periodic testing  IAW  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense,  to  ensure  proper  function  of  case  alarms. (T-2) A4.3.  Exhibit Lighting.  Keep lighting in the general exhibit areas at a level that promotes the safety and well-being of the artifacts. Use fluorescent lighting with U/V neutral density filtering protection,  or  incandescent  or  Halogen  lighting  that  are  properly  filtered  for  U/V  and  lux.  Heritage activities will not use incandescent fixtures or any heat-generating lighting for internal exhibit case lighting. (T-2) A4.3.1.  Light level for pigmented or dyed textiles, artwork, and manufactured goods cannot exceed 15 foot-candles or 150 lux. A4.3.2.  Construct  and  position  ballast  areas  of  fluorescent  light  fixtures  to  allow  adequate ventilation of heat away from the case interior. A4.4.  Exhibit  Maintenance.  Establish  standards,  schedules,  and  procedures  for  cleaning  and maintaining exhibits that best preserve the historical property on display. A4.4.1.  Dust  exhibit  furniture  and  freestanding  objects  as  needed  to  maintain  a  clean, professional appearance. A4.4.2.  Examine  artifacts  within  cases  on  a  regular  basis  "through  the  glass"  for deterioration.    Heritage  activities  will  examine  questionable  activity  "behind  the  glass"  if required. (T-2)   92  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 A4.4.3.  Open  exhibit  cases  on  a  scheduled  basis.    Dust  cases  and  clean  interior  glass  with housekeeping  products  and  methods  that  do  not  harm  artifacts.    Consult  NMUSAF Conservator for a list of acceptable products. A4.4.4.  Heritage  activities  will  remove  deteriorating  artifacts  from  display  and  contact  the NMUSAF Conservator for corrective actions. (T-2) A4.4.5.  Heritage  activities  will  periodically  inspect  exhibit  panels,  cases,  photographs, transparencies, signs and labels for any damage, wear, and fading.  Repair or replace them as needed. (T-3) A4.4.6.  Heritage  activities  will  maintain  exhibits  with  working  parts  (such  as  interactive computer  displays,  touch  screens  or  other  mechanical  devices)  in  good  working  condition. (T-3) A4.5.  Exhibit  Documentation.  Establish  a  project  file  for  each  exhibit,  regardless  of  size.  When complete, the file becomes historical reference material.  Project files may include: A4.5.1.  The final exhibit script. A4.5.2.  A  list  of  property  currently  displayed  in  the  exhibit  including  accession  or accountability numbers.  Update as objects are added, changed, or removed from the exhibit. A4.5.3.  Photocopies  with  notes  on  reproduction  specifications  for  any  photographs displayed. A4.5.4.  Relevant correspondence associated with the exhibit. A4.5.5.  The preliminary design package, which may include: A4.5.5.1.  Drawing(s) of plan and elevations. A4.5.5.2.  Any renderings. A4.5.5.3.  Color scheme used. A4.5.5.4.  Graphics. A4.5.5.5.  Photographs of study models. A4.5.6.  Construction documents, which may include: A4.5.6.1.  Construction drawings and/or details. A4.5.6.2.  Dimensions and materials callouts. A4.5.6.3.  Finish treatments. A4.5.6.4.  Materials and parts list. A4.5.6.5.  Security hardware and alarm system, if required. A4.5.6.6.  Dimensions  and  cross-referenced  notes  on  placement  of  graphics,  copy,  and artifacts. A4.5.7.  Materials  manufacturer  and  sales  source  list,  and  if  possible,  as-built  drawings and/or photographs of the finished exhibit. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   93  A4.5.8.  Photographic prints or digital photographs on disc, documenting finished exhibit in detail for security and record-keeping purposes.    94  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 Attachment 5 COMPLETING RADIATION SURVEY AND PERFORMING SWIPE SAMPLES A5.1.  Radiation Survey and Swipe Sample Analysis. A5.1.1.  This attachment assumes survey personnel (normally Installation RSO or designee) have  some  knowledge  and  experience  in  basic  radiation  protection  and  the  use  of  radiation detection  instrumentation.    Survey  personnel  should  work  closely  with  HPC  to  ensure adequate  familiarity  with  historic  aerospace  vehicles  that  may  contain  radioactive  material.  See Chapter 9 for additional information about radiation safety. the A5.1.2.  Aerospace  vehicle/component  radiation  survey  documentation requirements  listed  in  AFI  48-148.    HPC,  working  with  Installation  RSO  or  designee,  will complete  the  documentation  accurately  since  it  becomes  the  historical  radiation  file  for  the respective aerospace vehicle, artifact, or RSI. (T-1) includes A5.2.  Survey Log (AF Form 3583).  RSO or designee completes the Survey Log as follows: A5.2.1.  Section  1:    Aerospace  Vehicles.    Complete  this  section  of  the  Survey  Log  for surveys of aerospace vehicles. A5.2.1.1.  Box  1A:  Survey  date.    Note  date  (yyyy-mm-dd)  that  survey  is  being conducted. A5.2.1.2.  Box  1B:  Survey  performed  by.    Include  first  and  last  name  of  individual conducting  the  survey,  and  full  name  of  organization  (no  organizational  symbols)  in which that individual serves. A5.2.1.3.  Box 1C:  Installation.  Note installation where survey is being performed. A5.2.1.4.  Box 1D: Accession Number. This number is assigned as a tracking tool for all historical  property.    Obtain  accession  number(s)  from  the  DD  Form  1149  used  as  a receipt  for  the  item.  To  identify  radioactive  components  installed  on  an  aerospace vehicle, use the vehicle’s accession number. A5.2.1.5.  Box 1E: Vehicle Mission/Design/Series.  Enter the type of aircraft, missile, or drone being surveyed (e.g. F-105G, B-25B, AGM-28A, CIM-10A, RQ-4A, GTD-21B). A5.2.1.6.  Box 1F: Vehicle Serial Number.  Obtain this number from the DD Form 1149.  This  number  also  appears  on  the  aerospace  vehicle  identification  plate  permanently affixed to the inside of the airframe. A5.2.1.7.  Box  1G:  Radiation  Detection  Instrument  Information.    Note  the  type  of instrument  used, manufacturer, model number, serial  number, and the date calibrated in the spaces provided. A5.2.1.8.  Box  1H:    Inventory  and  survey  information.    Complete  boxes  1  and  2  and columns 3-10 for each radioactive component in/on the aerospace vehicle. A5.2.1.8.1.  Box  1:  Background  Radiation  Level.    Using  a  radiation  detection instrument, document background radiation level and record in space provided. A5.2.1.8.2.  Box 2: Exterior Vehicle Public Dose Level.  Using a radiation detection instrument,  capture  dose  level  no  less  than  30  centimeters  (about  one  foot)  from AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   95  exterior of aerospace vehicle.  If vehicle is displayed behind stanchions, rails, fencing, or  other  barrier,  capture  dose  rate  from  that  barrier  (i.e.  where  the  public  would normally  stand  to  view).    Dose  level  should  be  captured  from  exterior  area  where most  of  the  radioactive  components  or  material  are  located  (cockpit,  tail  section, wing, etc.). A5.2.1.8.3.  Column 3: Item Number.  Number all radioactive components within the aerospace vehicle in sequence.  Place this number on the 1/4-inch red dot, diagram, or photograph used to identify the item as radioactive (see paragraph 9.5.7). A5.2.1.8.4.  Column  4:    Location  description  of  item.    Specify  the  radioactive component's  location  (e.g.  pilot  or  co-pilot  seat  instrument  panel,  fuselage  station number).  If location cannot be identified contact NMUSAF RSO. A5.2.1.8.5.  Column  5:  Nomenclature.    Describe  the  radioactive  component  (e.g. compass, toggle switch, circuit breaker, counterweight). A5.2.1.8.6.  Column 6: Radioactive Material.  Complete as follows:  if the component is  a  skin  panel,  the  isotope  (radioactive  material)  is  probably  Th  232  (thorium); radioactive  material  on  dials,  gauges,  circuit  breakers,  toggle  switches,  etc.  are probably  Ra  226  (radium);  the  radioactive  material  on  counterweights  are  depleted uranium (DU).  If the radioactive material is unknown, mark column with a question mark (?) and contact NMUSAF RSO. A5.2.1.8.7.  Column  7:    Device  Dimension  (Inches).    Measure  the  component’s diameter in inches. A5.2.1.8.8.  Column 8: Activity (µCi).  Note the amount of radioactivity  in the item in  units  of  microcuries  (µCi).  Refer  to  “Activity  Determination  Rules  of  Thumb” reference spreadsheet in NMUSAF Sharepoint site at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-ED-AF-22/default.aspx for calculating this information. A5.2.1.8.9.  Column  9:  Public  Dose  Rate  (mR/hr).    Enter  gamma  measurements  of the public dose rate in milliRoentgens per hour (mR/hr).  Public dose measurements should be determined using a pressurize ionization chamber (PIC) which is the most appropriate  radiation  monitoring  instrument.  Where  applicable,  measurements  for aircraft are obtained at each crew station, i.e. pilot, co-pilot, navigator, etc.  Annotate this  column to  clearly  reflect  these  different  crew  stations.     In  addition,  an  exterior measurement  of  the  aerospace  vehicle  is  obtained,  at  chest  level,  from  a  location where members of the public would normally stand to  view the display.   Note:    for the purposes of determining public dose, one mR/hr for x and gamma radiation equals one millirem/hr.  The public dose standard is 2 millirem in any one hour and less than 100 millirem per year. A5.2.1.8.10.  Column  10:    Swipe  (yes/no).    Take  a  swipe  sample  of  all  intact radioactive components.  Enter a “Y” or “yes” when the swipe has been taken, or “N” or “no” if for some reason the swipe is not taken at time of survey.  Submit swipes to the  USAF  School  of  Aerospace  Medicine,  USAFSAM/OEHH,  2510  Fifth  Street, Area B, Building 20840, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7913. Any questions on proper  swipe  submittal  processes  or  procedures  should  be  directed  to  this  office  as well. NOTE:  Do not take swipe samples from items containing unprotected radium   96  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 paint.  Swipe-sampling  such  items  is  presumed  to  indicate  removable  radium contamination  and  may  create  additional  contamination  by  dislodging  the  fragile paint.    Items  containing  unprotected  radium  paint  include  radioluminous  circuit breakers, flight instruments with broken glass, and diluter-demand oxygen regulators from propeller-driven aircraft and some early jets. A5.2.1.9.  Use additional forms as needed and number pages sequentially. A5.2.2.  Section  2:  Aerospace  Component  (non-vehicles).    Complete  this  section  of  the Survey Log for surveys of individual components not attached to an aerospace vehicle. A5.2.2.1.  Box  2A:    Survey  date.    Note  date  (yyyy-mm-dd)  that  survey  is  being conducted. A5.2.2.2.  Box  2B:  Survey  performed  by.  Include  first  and  last  name  of  individual conducting  the  survey,  and  full  name  of  organization  (no  organizational  symbols)  in which that individual serves. A5.2.2.3.  Box 2C: Installation.  Note installation where survey is being performed. A5.2.2.4.  Box  2D:  Radiation  Detection  Instrument  Information.    Note  the  type  of instrument  used,  manufacturer,  model  number,  serial  number,  date  calibrated  in  the spaces provided. A5.2.2.5.  Box  2E:  Inventory  and  survey  information.    Complete  columns  1-8  for  each radioactive component. A5.2.2.5.1.  Box  1:  Background  Radiation  Level.    Using  a  radiation  detection instrument, document background radiation level and record in space provided. A5.2.2.5.2.  Column  2:  Accession/RSI  number.  Obtain  accession  numbers  from  the DD  Form  1149  used  as  a  receipt  for  the  item.    RSI  numbers  are  an  accountability tracking  number  different  than  an  accession  number  and  maintained  locally  (see paragraph 6.2.4). A5.2.2.5.3.  Column  3:    Nomenclature.    Describe  the  radioactive  component  (e.g. compass, toggle switch, circuit breaker, counterweight). A5.2.2.5.4.  Column 4: Display/storage location.  Specify the radioactive component's location (e.g. exhibit gallery and/or display case number, storage room/drawer/cabinet location). A5.2.2.5.5.  Column  5:    Radioactive  Material.    Complete  as  follows:    if  the component  is  a  skin  panel,  the  isotope  (radioactive  material)  is  probably  Th  232 (thorium); radioactive material on dials, gauges, circuit breakers, toggle switches, etc. are  probably  Ra  226  (radium);  the  radioactive  material  on  counterweights  are depleted uranium (DU).  If the radioactive material is unknown, mark column with a question mark (?) and contact NMUSAF RSO. A5.2.2.5.6.  Column 6: Device Dimension (Inches).  Measure the item’s diameter in inches. A5.2.2.5.7.  Column 7: Activity (µCi).  Note the amount of radioactivity  in the item in  units  of  microcuries  (µCi).    Refer  to  “Activity  Determination  Rules  of  Thumb” AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   97  reference spreadsheet in NMUSAF Sharepoint site at https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-ED-AF-22/default.aspx for calculating this information. A5.2.2.5.8.  Column 8:  Public dose rate (mR/hr).  Enter gamma measurements of the public  dose  rate  in  milliRoentgens  per  hour  (mR/hr).    Measurements  should  be determined using a pressurize ionization chamber (PIC) which is the most appropriate radiation  monitoring  instrument.    Determine  public  dose  by  placing  the  PIC  at  30 centimeters (approximately one foot) from the artifact and let the PIC stabilize for 15-20  seconds  before  annotating  the  reading  (milliR/hr).    Note:    for  the  purposes  of determining  public  dose,  one  mR/hr  for  x  and  gamma  radiation  equals  one millirem/hr.  The public dose standard is 2 millirem in any one hour and less than 100 millirem per year. A5.2.2.5.9.  Column 9: Swipe (yes/no).  Take a swipe sample of all intact radioactive components.  Enter a “Y” or “yes” when the swipe has been taken, or “N” or “no” if for some reason the swipe is not taken at time of survey.  Submit swipes to the USAF School  of  Aerospace  Medicine,  USAFSAM/OEHH,  2510  Fifth  Street,  Area  B, Building  20840,  Wright-Patterson  AFB,  OH  45433-7913.    Any  questions  on  proper swipe  submittal  processes  or  procedures  should  be  directed  to  this  office  as  well. NOTE:  Do not take swipe samples from items containing unprotected radium paint.  Swipe-sampling such items is presumed to indicate removable radium contamination and  may  create  additional  contamination  by  dislodging  the  fragile  paint.  Items containing  unprotected  radium  paint  include  radioluminous  circuit  breakers,  flight instruments with broken glass, and diluter-demand oxygen regulators from propeller-driven aircraft and some early jets. A5.2.2.6.  Use additional forms as needed and number pages sequentially. A5.3.  Swipe  Sample.  As  of  the  publication  of this  guidance,  swipe  samples  are  collected  and submitted  for  analysis  by  USAFSAM/OE  IAW  Air  Force  Research  Laboratory’s  Laboratory Sampling  Guide  (AFRL-SA-WP-SR-2012-0008),  available  at  http://www.dtic.mil.  Maintain swipe sample analysis report(s) received from USAFSAM/OE in the item's accession folder, RSI file, or individual aerospace vehicle file.  Use of AF Form 3584 has been rescinded and the form is now obsolete.  AF Form 3584s that document  previous swipe analyses collected prior to the date of this publication are acceptable and should be retained.    98  AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015 Attachment 6 UNIT MEMORABILIA A6.1.  Inactivating  organizations  seeking  to  preserve  specific  historically  or  heraldically unique items as unit memorabilia:  Are advised to carefully consider what should be included in  unit  memorabilia  boxes.    A  good  rule  of  thumb  is  to  consider  what  would  be  important  or significant  were  the  organization  to  reactivate  (see  6.2.3  and  6.2.7).    The  following  kinds  of items are recommended for inclusion: A6.1.1.  Photographs of all significant events in the unit's history as well as any unique items.  Label photographs with as much specific information as possible including but not limited to date, place, event,  and names of people pictured.  Any digital  media submitted is  in a PDF format. A6.1.2.  Copy  of  unit  lineage  and  honors  statement  and  color  photographs  of  heraldic emblem.  If the unit had a mascot, document it. A6.1.3.  Color photographs of the colors, markings, and insignia of the unit's aircraft. Include squadron  and  installation  commander’s  special  markings  when  applicable.  Include  vehicles and other equipment, if unique. A6.1.4.  Clothing items including but not limited to scarves, baseball caps and patches;  you may include morale patches and gaggle patches, but distinguish each.  Include two examples of each where possible. A6.1.5.  Significant  competition  trophies  and  awards.    Avoid  sports  trophies,  gifts  from visiting dignitaries, or minor awards of only local interest. A6.2.  Preparing, packing, and mailing unit memorabilia boxes. A6.2.1.  Unit  coordinates  with  their  MAJCOM/HO  prior  to  preparing  a  unit  memorabilia box. A6.2.2.  Avoid  including  delicate,  fragile,  or  easily  breakable  items.    Remove  glass  from framed documents or photographs. A6.2.3.  Include  an  inventory  of  all  items  in  the  box  and  provide  MAJCOM/HO  a  copy.  Ensure  each item  on the inventory includes an explanation regarding its  significance.  This assists those who may access the box should the unit reactivate (see Figure A6.1). A6.2.4.  See  paragraph  6.2.7.2  for  specifics  on  what  kind  of  box  to  use.    Box  size  cannot exceed 43" x 31 3/4" x 20 1/2", and 75 lbs.  As a rule, the smaller the box, the better. A6.2.5.  Units sending only flags, guidons, and related streamers may pack items in a padded mailing envelope instead of a box. A6.2.6.  If  shipping  via  United  States  Post  Office  (USPS),  send  to:  NMUSAF/MUC;  110 Spaatz Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7102. A6.2.7.  If shipping via any other commercial provider (e.g. Federal Express, United Parcel Service) send directly to NMUSAF/MUC at: NMUSAF/MUC; 2601 E Street, Area B, Bldg 5, Door 17; Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7102. AFI84-103  22 MAY 2015   99  Figure A6.1.
