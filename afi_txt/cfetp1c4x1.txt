This CFETP provides the information necessary for the Air Force Career Field  Manager (AFCFM), MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers,  supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage and conduct an effective and efficient career field  training program. The plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 1C4X1 must receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  For the purpose of this plan, training is divided into four areas: Initial skills, upgrade training (UGT), qualification training (QT) and  continuation training (CT).  Initial skills training is the Air Force Specialty (AFS) specific training an individual receives upon entering into the AFSC.  This training is provided by 342 Training Squadron (TRS) at JBSA Lackland, TX.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory  courses and task qualification requirements  required for award of the 5-, 7-, and 9-skill level.  Qualification training is hands-on task  performance training designed to qualify an Airman in a specific dutyposition.  This training  program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the  performance skills/knowledge training required to do the job.  Continuation training is additional  training provided to 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9- level personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond  the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, develop, manage, and conduct a career field training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an  individual’s career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in this specialtyand recommends training throughout each phase of an individual's career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training deliverymethod. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Use.  MFMs and supervisors at all levels use the plan to ensure a comprehensive and cohesive training program is available for each individual in the specialty. 2.1.  AETC training personnel develop and revise formal resident, non-resident and exportable training based on requirements established by the user and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They also work with the AFCFM to develop procurement and acquisition strategies for obtaining  resources needed to provide the identified training. 2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial and  upgrade skills requirements.  Identified requirements can be satisfied by OJT, resident training,  contract  training, or exportable courses.  MAJCOM and National Guard Bureau (NGB) developed training to support this  AFSC must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate available training  resources. 2.3.  The list of courses in Part II is used as a reference to support training. 6                     2.4.  Submit recommended CFETP improvements/corrections to the AFSC Training Manager at  342 TRS/TRR, 950 Voyager Dr, Lackland AFB, TX 78236-5724. 3.  Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy. MFMs and AETC training managers will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements. Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training. The AFCFM is the approval authority. MAJCOM and NGB representatives and AETC training personnel coordinate on the career field training requirements. The AFCFM is the authority for waiving any mandatory training requirement(s). Process waiver requests to the AFCFM as described in AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program Career Field Education and Training. Section B – AFS Progression and Information 4.

Purpose.  Skill level training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements.  This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for each skill level in broad, general terms and establishes the mandatory requirements for entry, award, and retention of each skill level.  The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the STS at Part II, Sections A and B of this CFETP. 10.  Specialty Qualifications: 10.1.  Apprentice Level Training:  NOTE:  Apprentice Physical Training.  Superior physical conditioning is a cornerstone of combat effectiveness.  TACP apprentice training emphasizes physical training to assure that course graduates have the temperament and potential to meet the intense physical challenges inherent in the TACP specialty.  Efficient training of TACP  Apprentices (3-skill level) is a complex effort.  The demanding physical nature of the TACP career  field coupled with the requirement to conduct high risk training/operations requires persistent  attention to detail in training.  This attention to detail can be learned and reinforced through  Motivational Training (MT) applied during the TACP Apprentice Course.  MT will be IAW  AETCI 36-2641, para 4.4.3.10, Technical and Basic Military Training Development, and  implemented into the course via an Annex to the Course Training Plans.  MT must be tied to and  support STS training line items as identified by course design and development personnel. 10.1.1.  Specialty Qualification. 10.1.1.1. Knowledge. Knowledge is mandatory of:  theater air, space and cyber operations to include; weapons systems and munitions characteristics and capabilities; aircraft employment; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities; targeting systems; close air support tactics, techniques and procedures; Military Decision Making Process; joint fires integration. 10.1.1.2.

Loan of equipment from operational units and internal adjustments (e.g. temporary increase of student to equipment ratios) have been coordinated. 11.2.  Journeyman Level Training: None identified. 11.3.  Craftsman Level Training: None identified. Section E – Transition Training Guide There are currently no transition training requirements. This area is reserved. 20 PART II Section A - Specialty Training Standard 1.  Implementation. This STS will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning 4 Jan 17-skill level training. Course implementation for 7-skill level training will be with classes beginning 27 Mar 17. The CDCs were deactivated. 2.  Purpose. As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS: 2.1.  Lists in column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airman to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by skill level, minimum task training requirements for upgrade to a particular skill level. 2.2.  Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Task certification must show documentation entries IAW AFI 36-2201, On the Job Training Administration. 2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task/knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course. 2.4.  Qualitative Requirements. The proficiency code key is used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses. 2.5.  Becomes a job qualification standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, OJT Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201, On The Job Training Administration. 2.6.  STS is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKT) are developed at the USAF Occupational Measurement Squadron by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS) catalog. Individual responsibilities are listed in chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System. WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Reserve Forces. 2.7.  Documentation. Document and certify completion of training. Identify duty position requirements by circling the subparagraph number or letter next to the task statement. Task are trained and qualified to the “Go” level. “Go” means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meet local demands for accuracy, timeliness, and correct use of procedures (“Go” level equates to 3c in the STS proficiency code key). Review AFI 36-2201 for the latest guidance. 21            2.7.1.  Transcribing. Transcribing documentation to a new CFETP is an administrative function, not a re-evaluation of training. Therefore, supervisor and trainer are considered synonymous for the purpose of documentation. Transcribe within 120 days (240 days for ARC) of published date of revised CFETP. Upon publication of a new CFETP, use the following procedures to transcribe: 2.7.1.1.  Use the new CFETP to identify past and current training requirements and to transcribe qualifications from the previous CFETP. 2.7.1.2.  For tasks previously certified and required in the current duty position, circle the subparagraph number next to the task statement and enter the current date in the completion column. Trainee initials in the trainee column and the current task certifier or supervisor/trainer initials in the trainer column. 2.7.1.3.  For tasks previously certified but not required in the current duty position (do not circle), transcribe only the previous certification date (no initials). If the task later becomes required in the duty position, recertify using current dates and initials. 2.7.1.4.  Annotate the AF Form 623a, (for example, “I certify the information contained in the CFETP dated XX was transcribed to the CFETP dated XX, and the trainee was given the superseded CFETP.” Signed and dated by supervisor and trainee). 2.7.2.  Decertification  and  Recertification.  When  a  supervisor  determines  an  Airman  is  unqualified on a task previously certified for their duty position, the supervisor erases the previous certification, or deletes  certification  when  using automated  system. Appropriate  remarks  pertaining to  the  reason for the decertification are entered on the AF Form 623a. Begin recertification (if required) following procedures in AFI 36-2201. 2.7.3.  Documenting Career Knowledge. When a CDC is not available, the supervisor identifies knowledge items in the CFETP, Part II, CDC column. Using Technical references required for career knowledge training, the supervisor briefs Airmen on their use. Airman completes study of references, is evaluated by the supervisor, and is certified in the CFETP. For two-time CDC course exam failures, supervisors identify all STS items corresponding to the areas covered by the CDC. The trainee completes a study of STS references, undergoes evaluation by the task certifier, and receives certification on the STS. NOTE: Career knowledge must be documented prior to submitting a CDC waiver. 3.  Recommendations. Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of AETC training. Reference this CFETP and address correspondence regarding changes to 37 TRG/DOS, 1220 Truemper Street, Lackland AFB, TX 78236. A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisor’s convenience to identify graduates who may have received over or under training on task/knowledge items listed in this training standard. For quick response to problems, call DSN 473-2917, any time day or night. 22         4.  Surveys. Field Evaluation Questionnaire (FEQ). FEQs are designed to solicit feedback from supervisors and/or graduates to determine if graduates were trained as specified in the training standard. FEQ Summaries (FEQS) summarize questionnaire results. Supervisors are the preferred source for evaluating recent graduates of initial skill courses. Survey graduates when a supervisory survey would not provide adequate feedback. When both graduate and supervisor data are gathered, present the data for each separately. In supervisor questionnaires, ask for an overall rating of graduates' job performance. In graduate questionnaires, ask for a rating of overall training provided. For more information concerning the FEQ and FEQS, refer to AETCI 36-2201. BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE OFFICIAL Attachment:  STS 1C4X1 HOWARD D.
