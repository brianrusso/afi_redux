Welcome to the 64P contracting career field!  No other set of individuals cares more about a 64P officer’s development than the collective contracting senior leaders and career field team—comprised of the Air Force Contracting Functional Manager (FM), senior military and civilian contracting leaders, the Contracting Development Team, the Career Field Manager (CFM), the staff at the Deputy Assistant Secretary (Contracting) Assistant Secretary (Acquisition) (SAF/AQC), the 64P Officer Assignments Team (OAT) at Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC), commanders, directors, and supervisors—are all committed to each 64P officer’s development from initial entry into the career field to either retirement or separation.  Uniting the contracting career field team’s deliberate development of its 64P officers with each officer’s successful demonstration of the competencies and tasks outlined in this plan will ensure Air Force Contracting continues its proud tradition of growing the Department of Defense’s (DoD) most technically proficient officer contracting workforce. 2. What does it mean to be a 64P? 2.1. The 64P career field is an exciting, challenging, and rewarding career field.  64P officer technical development is unique compared to other Air Force specialties.  In order to guarantee the qualifications of 64P officers charged with ensuring the integrity of the acquisition process, 64P officers develop specific technical skills through a combination of training, certifications, and years of experience.  Fully-qualified 64P officers gain experience through a myriad of developmental opportunities including deployments and operational, systems, research and development, logistics/sustainment, and specialized contracting assignments. 2.2. The primary responsibility of 64P officers is to be business advisors.  64P officers work closely with the customers they support to determine how to best satisfy each customer’s requirements while complying with governing laws, regulations, and policies.  Customers may be defined in a myriad of ways, such as units, organizations, weapon system programs, space/missile programs, or warfighters.  Reaching out to customers is critical to relationship- building and mission accomplishment.  As the business advisor, 64P officers should look for opportunities to both teach and train customers early and often.  The teaching role involves advising customers where and how their funds have been spent in the past.  The training role involves showing customers where contracting needs their support in order to find a fiscally responsible solution to their requirements.  Rigorous customer engagement begins in the planning cycle and continues throughout the acquisition process.  Proactively engaging customers during the planning cycle of the acquisition process is critical to avoiding rework and creating significant long-term savings. 2.3. The 64P career field is dynamic.  64P officers must continue to stay abreast of regulatory changes, policy updates, command directives, and private sector business and accounting 3        updates, and one way to do that is through continuous learning.  Devoting daily time to personal and professional learning is crucial in the development of critical thinking and the maintenance of professional skills. 2.4. Above all, the contracting career field derives and sustains its greatness from the exceptional professionals in the career field that exemplify the five guiding principles listed in Figure 1.  Air Force contracting professionals embody integrity, fairness, innovation, mentoring, and excellence in all they do—all in support of our Nation and profession. Figure 1.  Air Force Contracting Guiding Principles. 3.  CFETP Goals and Structure. 3.1. The goals of the CFETP are to:  •  Outline the education and training necessary to become a fully-qualified 64P officer (i.e., attain the AFSC 64P3). •  Communicate the career development opportunities available to 64P officers. •  Provide the occupational and institutional information necessary to allow 64P officers and their commanders/directors (i.e., Chiefs of Contracting Offices (COCOs)), supervisors, and mentors to jointly build a personalized career path to success. 3.2. The CFETP consists of two parts, which supervisors will use to plan, manage, and track training within the specialty. 4        3.2.1.  Part I is subdivided into four sections and provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty: •  Section A explains how contracting professionals will utilize the plan. •  Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path. •  Section C associates each AFSC level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, training, and experience). •  Section D identifies resource constraints such as funds, manpower, equipment, and facilities. 3.2.2.  Part II is also subdivided into four sections and provides information on qualification training requirements for 64P officers: •  Section A identifies Course Training Standards (CTS), qualitative and qualification training requirements, available in-residence or correspondence courses, and Air Force Specialty Code levels. •  Section B identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine the resources available to support qualification training. •  Section C identifies available support materials which may be utilized to support qualification training. •  Section D is reserved for any future MAJCOM or other unique requirements. 4. Guidance on revisions and feedback.  The AFCFM will conduct an annual review process to ensure this CFETP remains relevant for the effective development of 64P officers.  Future editions of the CFETP will provide guidance on how to integrate the new CFETP with older versions and define which task lists supervisors should utilize for their personnel.  Feedback on potential improvements to the CFETP should be routed to SAF/AQCX at the “USAF Pentagon SAF-AQ Mailbox SAF-AQCX Workflow” account. 5      ABBREVIATIONS AND TERMS EXPLAINED AAD.

The CFETP has several purposes: 1.1. Identifies requirements for each qualification and APDP level, and recommends training for each phase of an officer’s career. 1.2. Provides references to training courses, training materials, and other useful career resources. 1.3. Conveys career development opportunities which officers and supervisors may use to help shape an individual’s contracting career. 2. Uses.  This plan will be used by unit commanders and contracting office directors (i.e., COCOs), Unit Training Managers (UTMs), PKX Resource Managers, supervisors, trainers, and individuals in qualification training.  Paragraph 4 below explains the responsibilities of individuals involved in the development of 64P officers. 3. Coordination and Approval.  The AFCFM (SAF/AQCX) is the approval authority for changes or variations to the CFETP. 4. Responsibilities.  The following training responsibilities are assigned to each Air Force organizational level in accordance with this CFETP and AFI 36-2201, Air Force Training Program. 4.1. SAF/AQC.  SAF/AQC will monitor the progress of contracting training course development (entry, transition, and supplemental) and eliminate roadblocks preventing timely course development.  SAF/AQCX is the office of coordinating responsibility for the establishment of training policy to support the entire contracting career field. 4.2. AFCFM.  The AFCFM will conduct an annual review of the CFETP and approve any changes or variations to the CFETP.  Recommended changes to the CFETP should be forwarded to the AFCFM in accordance with Part I, Preface, paragraph 5. 4.3. Commanders/Directors (i.e., COCOs). 4.3.1.  Commanders/directors will ensure 64P officers accomplish formal and unit/contracting office follow-on training as specified in this CFETP.  Commanders/directors will: •  Ensure a unit/contracting office Master Task Listing (MTL) is created for 64P officers. •  From a unit/contracting office MTL, develop individual training plans (ITP) for 64P officers in their first or second assignment (ITPs are at the discretion of the commander/director once the officer has completed one assignment in operational contracting and one assignment in systems acquisition). 15              •   Schedule regular updates with UTMs/PKX Resource Managers and supervisors to track and monitor an officer’s progress on ITP tasks. •   Monitor training effectiveness through regular feedback with 64P officers in training and reports provided by UTMs/PKX Resource Managers. •   Select and approve trainers based upon their experience and ability to provide instruction to officers in qualification training (documentation of trainer approval is completed when the commander/director signs page one of Attachment 1). •  Develop a solid job rotation program to ensure the best possible training environment for 64P officers. •  Consider a 64P officer’s proficiency in accordance with their ITP when considering when and if the 64P officer should be reassigned to another position. •  Ensure an initial review of training records is conducted for all newly assigned 64P officers to ensure proper continuation of training. •  Provide assistance to outside agencies with contracting personnel assigned to ensure the same level of training is afforded to all 64P officers in qualification training. •  Notify their chain of command about formal training shortfalls to ensure timely correction and redirection of formal training emphasis. •  Ensure 64P officers continue to receive mentoring and professional growth opportunities after they complete qualification training. 4.3.2.  Commanders/directors will work with their director of business operations (if available), superintendent (if available), supervisors, UTM and PKX Resource Managers, trainers, and other subject matter experts to create a unit/contracting office MTL based on those tasks in Attachment 1 that are applicable to the officer’s current unit/contracting office.  Commanders/directors will take their unit/contracting office MTL and create ITPs for each 64P officer that meets the applicability criteria identified in paragraph 4.7.1. below.  The intent of the ITP should be to indoctrinate the officer in core contracting tasks/competencies, tasks required for success in the officer’s current position, and foundational competencies required for a successful contracting career.  For 64P1 officers, at a minimum, all core tasks must be included in the officer’s ITP. For 64P3 officers, units/contracting offices should tailor the ITP to include competencies and tasks that can be taught through experiential learning.  Core tasks are not required on a 64P3’s ITP since the officer will have already demonstrated proficiency on core tasks to earn the 64P3 AFSC.  When creating their unit/contracting office MTL, units/contracting offices shall use the Proficiency Code Key to populate column 4 (proficiency levels associated with tasks) and ensure proficiency levels are standardized across their unit/contracting office.  Those proficiency codes annotated with an asterisk in column 4 have been taught at MRC-102 to the proficiency level indicated; therefore, supervisors may take that into their discretion when training and certifying those tasks. 4.4. Unit Training Managers (UTM) and PKX Resource Managers.  Unit Training Managers and PKX Resource Managers implement and manage training programs, policies, and procedures, as directed by higher headquarters, commanders, and Base Training.  UTMs and PKX Resource Managers will also provide reports to commanders/directors (i.e., COCOs) regarding the officers’ qualification training progress.  As a minimum, reports should specifically address each 64P1 officer’s certification progress on core tasks in accordance with the timeline requirements levied in Part I, Section A, paragraph 4.7.1.1. 16            4.5. Supervisors.  Supervisors will: •  Have a working knowledge of the CFETP. •  Know  their  responsibilities  related  to  conducting  and  assessing  training  on  tasks identified in the unit’s MTL. •  Educate subordinates on how to use the CFETP. •  Ensure subordinates are exposed to a breadth of workload and other applicable training to support assessment of task completion associated with the subordinate’s position. •  Assist  commanders/directors  (i.e.,  COCOs)  with  the  development  of  a  unit/contracting office MTL and ensure each of their subordinates has an ITP. •  Document a 64P officer’s completion of qualification training tasks on the officer’s ITP. •  Maintain a training record folder for each officer they supervise, which must contain the officer’s  ITP  alongside  the  AF  Form  1098  for  CCO  training  (see  Part  II,  Section  B, paragraph 5. for CCO training documentation requirements) (folders may be maintained electronically or hard-copy). •  Provide officers with their training records prior to reassignment (for transfer to their new supervisor). •  Review the CFETP and ITP with each subordinate within 30 days of assignment and bi- annually (at a minimum) to coincide with the normal feedback cycle and plot a path to demonstrate proficiency on core and non-core tasks as required by paragraph 4.7. below. •  For 64P officers on a rotational plan, review the officer’s ITP within 30 days of rotation to a new job within the organization (this may include other personnel that monitor the officer’s daily activities and workload even though they are not the officer’s supervisor). 4.6. Trainers.  Trainers will plan, conduct, and document training/experience on the officer’s ITP.  They are selected based upon their experience and ability to provide instruction to officers in qualification training.  Trainers should utilize the Air Force Contracting Central “Learning Center” and “Knowledge Center” for training materials, templates, and other resources highlighted in Part II, Section C of the CFETP.  A supervisor may also serve as a trainer. Trainers do not need to be of a higher rank/grade than the 64P officer in qualification training. 4.7. 64P Officers in Qualification Training.  Qualification training is defined as demonstrating proficiency in the core and non-core tasks listed on the individual’s unit/contracting office MTL. 4.7.1.  Applicability. 4.7.1.1.  64P1 designated officers that entered active duty on/after 1 January 2014 must demonstrate proficiency on all ITP core tasks and have at least 12 months of contracting experience in order to achieve the qualified AFSC designation of 64P3.  64P1 officers must complete all core and non-core tasks no later than 36 months from assignment to their unit. 4.7.1.2.  64Ps in their second contracting assignment (i.e., first PCS after his/her first assignment into a 64P position) must demonstrate proficiency on all ITP designated tasks/competencies no later than 36 months from assignment to that unit.  Due to the fact that the 64P CFETP is new to the career field, this 36 month requirement starts for all new second 17 assignments after the date of the 64P CFETP’s initial publication.  Additionally, commanders/directors (i.e., COCOs) may use discretion in establishing an individual timeline for those officers who were already in their second assignment prior to the date of the 64P CFETP initial publication. 4.7.1.3.  64P officers in their third or subsequent assignments should demonstrate proficiency on any tasks/competencies determined necessary by their commander/director, such as refresher training or other unit/contracting office specific training.  ITPs are at the discretion of the commander/director once the officer has completed one assignment in operational contracting and one assignment in systems acquisition. 4.7.2.  64P officers should also complete APDP and Continuous Learning (CL) training requirements as associated with position requirements. 4.7.3.  64P officers will transfer their training records from their losing unit/contracting office supervisor to their gaining unit/contracting office supervisor. 18     SECTION B – CAREER PROGRESSION AND INFORMATION 1. Specialty Description.  The contracting career field encompasses the functions required to contract for requirements essential to Air Force daily operations and the warfighting mission. This includes accomplishing contracting system processes, formulating contracting policy and procedures, coordinating contracting activities, leading and directing contracting operations, and deploying in support of contingency operations.  Contracting processes and functions include effective acquisition planning, solicitation, cost or price analysis, evaluating offers, source selection, contract award, contract administration, and closeout.  To progress in this career field, 64P officers should seek a depth of contracting knowledge and breadth of contracting experience, and effectively apply both their knowledge and experience in various leadership positions. 1.2. Duties and Responsibilities of 64P Officers. 1.2.1.  Lead, plan, organize, and direct contracting operations.  Lead contracting functions and personnel by fostering an environment where contracting activities and customers form teams dedicated to meeting Air Force requirements.  Determine organizational structure, physical facilities, and personnel requirements for accomplishing contracting responsibilities.  Direct accomplishment of contracting system functions, ensure contracting processes are responsive to mission needs and requirements, and ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements.  Develop and implement manual and automated internal systems and processes that seek to maximize efficiencies while accomplishing, monitoring and required reporting on the contracting mission. 1.2.2.  Accomplish contracting processes and functions.  Serve as a warranted contracting officer.  Participate in acquisition planning to include analyzing purchase requests and technical documents for suitability and determining the proper contracting method and contract type. Prepare and distribute solicitations.  Evaluate offers, including cost or price analysis, contractor responsibility and responsiveness to solicitation, and evaluating other selected factors (e.g., quality, contractor management and facilities, delivery, etc.).  Select contract source, assemble contracts, and make awards.  Negotiate modifications, and take appropriate termination actions for convenience, default, or cause.  Understand and interpret contract terms and conditions to include resolving contract questions, disagreements, disputes, etc. for both the Government and contractor team.  Process unauthorized commitments using the proper ratification authority. Prepare and process documentation related to protests, equitable adjustments, and claims. Administer contracts to ensure contract compliance.  Closeout contracts within a reasonable time from the completion of contract performance and payment. 1.2.3.  Coordinate contracting activities.  Advise commanders and staff on contracting operations, as well as impact of new directives and policy on the contracting system.  Coordinate with and educate other functional activities to improve advance planning and ensure adequacy and correctness of contracting approach, lead-time, purchase descriptions, specifications, funding, etc.  Confer with other Government agencies, military departments, and commercial concerns to explain mission requirements, contractual interpretations, policy, and program 19       interpretation.  Coordinate with external organizations such as finance, legal, Small Business Administration, DCAA, and DCMA to accomplish overall mission. 1.2.4.  Formulate contracting policies and procedures.  Analyze contracting processes and establish policies and procedures to improve customer support.  Establish policies that are based on sound business practices and highest standards of ethical conduct and fiscal responsibility. Develop automated systems essential to enhancing contracting efficiency.  Manage military and civilian career development programs and policies to ensure individuals have the opportunity for training, education, and experience needed for mission success and professional advancement. 1.2.5.  Provide expeditionary combat support by deploying as a contingency contracting officer to enable military operations worldwide.  Review all tasked operation plans (OPLANs) and relevant host tenant support agreements, inter-command agreements, joint support plans, and host nation support agreements to determine deployment support requirements.  Develop and maintain current site surveys, vendor/source lists, and other requirements data unique to the area of responsibility.  Develop and maintain local checklists and procedures to support the Installation Emergency Management Plan (IEMP) 10-2. 1.3. Elements of the Career Field.  Over the course of a 64P officer’s career, he/she should gain experience in the three principal elements of the contracting career field—operational contracting, systems acquisition and sustainment, and contract administration—and have many other exciting development opportunities such as squadron command, joint positions, staff assignments, materiel leader, deputy mission support group commander, mission support group commander, senior materiel leader, AFICA OL director, senior center contracting official, and senior contracting official.  Each element plays a key role in the success of the Air Force mission and helps develop officers in the contracting career field as future air and space leaders. 2. Skill and Career Progression Information.  Adequate training and timely progression from the entry level (64P1) to the qualified level (64P3) and then to staff level (64P4), play an important role in the Air Force’s ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, manage, and conduct an effective training program. The following subparagraphs will introduce the three stage development model and expound on the occupational competencies, career development opportunities, APDP requirements, and AFSC levels within each of the three development stages. 2.1. There are three developmental stages:   tactical, operational, and strategic.  Each stage is important and provides unique experiences, and collectively, the tactical, operational and strategic sight pictures (Figures 2, 5, 6, and 9) provide an integrated and progressive approach to building contracting competencies.  Each level’s sight picture figure is displayed in a distinct color (e.g., tactical is blue, operational is maroon, and strategic is green) that matches the development levels highlighted in the career pyramid (Figure 10).  An individual, their mentor (see subsection 2.7.6. for information on mentoring) and their supervisor should regularly discuss the competencies, education, training, and experience displayed in the Figures 2, 5, 6, and 9 to identify short and long-term career development goals and opportunities.  These sight pictures can be used as a guide, but ultimately these choices are up to the individual since they will define and make their own career choices based on an understanding of Air Force needs and 20       their individual aspirations, abilities, and priorities.  64P officers must take ownership of their career decisions and records.  Moreover, the number of years associated with each level should be used as a guide, with the understanding that individuals enter the career field with varying levels of experience and everyone will progress at different rates. 2.2. Tactical Level (Approximately 0-10 Years of Contracting).  The tactical level is further subdivided into the entry and intermediate levels, and provides the foundational contracting experience that 64P officers will rely on throughout their career.  During this phase of an individual’s career, they have the opportunity to learn and master basic contracting competencies, while gaining a depth of contracting experience.  Training tasks are focused on acquiring knowledge and beginning to demonstrate competency in a host of contracting areas. At this level, officers will also develop foundational business knowledge and skills upon which they can build a successful contracting career.  As 64P officers learn about themselves and their impact on others, as both a team member and a leader, they will also grow into the Air Force culture and adapt to the Air Force’s core values.  Officers will gain a general understanding of team leadership and an appreciation for institutional leadership, developing firsthand experience in contracting by working on various buying tasks, and working towards their APDP Level I and II certifications in contracting.  Commanders/directors (i.e., COCOs)/supervisors will provide ample opportunities for 64P officers to gain this experience while exposing them to the entire mission of the unit.  The Tactical Sight Picture in Figure 2 displays occupational competencies desired of successful buyers/administrators, and portrays the training, certification, experience, and education individuals should strive to achieve through assignment and deployment opportunities.  While participation in education and training courses will offer officers exposure to a significant amount of task related materials, officers should seek opportunities for experiential learning related to their ITP tasks and other rotational assignments. 21   Figure 2.  Tactical Level Sight Picture For Buyers/Administrators.  2.2.1.  Entry Sublevel (Approximately 0-4 Years of Contracting). 2.2.2.  Operational Contracting.  64P officers typically begin their careers in Air Force Contracting at an operational contracting unit, which may be designated as a squadron (CONS), flight (CONF), division (PZI), or another organizational entity designed to meet local needs. These units may be led by contracting squadron (or flight) commanders, office chiefs, or directors (i.e., COCOs).  Subordinate elements of an operational contracting unit may be a contracting flight, contracting branch, or another organizational component determined locally. The operational unit’s goal is to provide timely, effective and efficient cradle-to-grave contract support to meet the needs of installation commanders, deployed commanders, and resident, tenant, and supported units. 2.2.2.1.  Starting in an operational unit is a deliberate development step for 64P accession officers and cross-flows.  An operational assignment provides a new 64P officer with opportunities to experience the full spectrum of cradle-to-grave contracting, from pre-solicitation to closeout.  The magnitude of actions in this spectrum fosters opportunities to explore and apply the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and its applicable supplements.  These experiences are 22      formative towards successful application as a future supervisor, commander, and senior contracting official.  It would be optimal for a 64P to award and administer each requirement type (i.e., commodities, services, and construction) during their first operational tour to expand their knowledge of the different types of operational contracting. 2.2.2.2.  As a future senior contracting leader, it is imperative for a 64P officer to be technically proficient in contracting.  In the first assignment, the primary objective is to learn.  A 64P officer should seek out as many different contracting experiences as possible during this assignment. Each experience offers insight into contracting knowledge and practical lessons learned so that in the future, the 64P officer has a solid foundation to use in even more complex acquisition situations.  While building this foundation, 64P officers should also commit to a discipline of continuous education and improvement so they can deal with the contracting profession’s ever- changing landscape. 2.2.2.3.  A 64P officer should strive to learn and develop towards becoming a warranted contracting officer (CO).  This process requires self-motivation, study, practice, and experience. A 64P officer should study the FAR and its applicable supplements to enhance his/her technical knowledge and likelihood of passing the CO warrant test.  Consider the importance of setting the example since non-commissioned officers must pass the CO warrant test in order to achieve their 7-level skill level.  Upon passing the CO warrant test, he/she should meet a warrant board made up of senior COs, legal and finance professionals.  The warranting process is rigorous for a reason—a CO has a professional responsibility to the taxpayers to make smart, ethical decisions, complete with sound business acumen and critical thinking to support the warfighter.  While holding a warrant is situational-dependent (i.e., the number and thresholds of warrants may depend of the unit’s workload and manning), a 64P officer can take all the steps necessary to demonstrate contracting competence. 2.2.2.4.  As the 64P CGO develops their functional expertise in contracting, they should actively seek contracting leadership opportunities such as a warranted team lead or a flight chief of an acquisition flight—depending upon the needs of the unit (not the individual).  The third or fourth year of a CGO’s operational assignment is an ideal progression of development and responsibility. 2.2.2.5.  Executive Officer.  Executive officers oversee the information management activities for the commander/director and/or deputy commander/director.  They handle protocol duties as required; implement, direct and coordinate executive functions, services and activities; represent the commander with other agencies of all levels; and are responsible for unit programs and special projects as directed by the commander/director.  They manage, supervise and coordinate activities of command section staff ensuring proper development, implementation, and execution of policy and programs.  Lastly, they prepare executive correspondence and review staff documents prepared for the commander’s/director’s signature to ensure compliance with established procedures.  An executive officer assignment is a unique developmental opportunity, but timing is important.  The time served as an executive officer is at an opportunity cost of not developing the skills and experiences within the contracting career field.  Group and/or wing executive officer jobs should be considered for an officer in his/her fourth year of an operational contracting assignment.  New 64P accessions should remain in the contracting squadron for the 23      first few years of their career, since the main objective of sending 64P accessions to a CONS is to learn contracting in accordance with their ITP. 2.2.2.6.  Entry AFSC (64P1).  Upon entry into the contracting career field and completion of the Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRCO) Course (or equivalent Initial Skills Training course), 64Ps earn the entry level AFSC of 64P1.  Officers may take the initiative to complete enlisted 6C0X1 Career Development Courses (CDCs), but they are not required to do so. 2.2.2.7.  Qualified AFSC (64P3).  The local Military Personnel Section (MPS) will send a notice to the individual’s supervisor to approve or disapprove the 64P3 AFSC upgrade after 12 months in a contracting position.  Individuals must have the aforementioned 12 months experience and have demonstrated proficiency on all core task requirements listed in Attachment 1 in order to earn the 64P3 Air Force Specialty Code designation.  Supervisors have the direct responsibility for overseeing a 64P officer’s progression and verifying completion of tasks listed in the officer’s individual training plan. 2.2.2.8.  Basic Occupational Badge.  In accordance with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, 64P officers wear the basic acquisition badge after graduating from the Mission Ready Contracting Officer Course (MRC-102, or equivalent). Figure 3.  Basic Acquisition Badge.  2.2.3.  Intermediate Sublevel (Approximately 4-10 Years of Contracting).  Individuals should seek to gain additional depth with functional specialization in the contracting career field as well as breadth by striving for systems, classified, and/or specialized contracting assignments, as well as career broadening opportunities, to broaden their breadth of knowledge, experience, and expertise. 2.2.3.1.  Systems Contracting.  Gaining systems experience, particularly participating in major acquisition programs, is key to a 64P officer’s career progression.  64P officers are high demand, low density assets in the acquisitions community, which makes each and every 64P officer vitally important to the program offices in which they serve.  Opportunities exist in organizations such as Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC). Contracting in AFMC encompasses the acquisition, development, testing, and maintenance (sustainment) of existing and future weapon systems and business and enterprise systems. Contracting in SMC involves the acquisition, development, testing, and maintenance (sustainment) of space and missile systems. 2.2.3.1.1.  Throughout the systems assignment, a 64P officer should learn the complexities of the duties that PCOs perform, as well as the role of contracting in the acquisition environment. 64P officers should focus on understanding acquisition strategy, the importance of using the appropriate contract type for each acquisition, contract pricing, contractor negotiations, and source selections. 24                 2.2.3.1.2.  While he/she may not be the lead PCO on an acquisition, a 64P officer should demonstrate initiative to participate by seeking an unlimited PCO warrant.  In order to earn a PCO warrant, candidates must pass the Air Force Contracting Officer Warrant Test and a warrant board interview.  While holding a warrant is situational-dependent (one must occupy a position requiring a warrant in order to obtain one), a 64P officer can take all the steps necessary to demonstrate contracting competence. 2.2.3.1.3.  Types of Systems Contracting. Systems Acquisition.  Efforts span five “enterprises”:   aircraft, armament, 2.2.3.1.3.1. command and control, business and enterprise systems, and space acquisitions are carried out at Air Force Life Cycle Management Center directorates located at Wright-Patterson, Eglin, Maxwell-Gunter Annex, and Hanscom AFBs, and Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) at Los Angeles AFB, respectively.  The bulk of contract activity at these centers is accomplished through modifications and orders against major contracts awarded at these locations.  Other unique opportunities within systems acquisition include Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and joint systems procurements.  Systems acquisition is primarily an AFMC responsibility, except for SMC which is aligned to the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC). Sustainment Contracting.  Provides worldwide support of fielded U.S. Air Force, 2.2.3.1.3.2. FMS, and joint systems, to include spare parts, repair, and maintenance and modification of systems, equipment, and software.  This work is accomplished primarily by the Air Force Sustainment Center’s three Air Force logistics complexes at Hill, Robins, and Tinker AFBs. Contracting professionals in this environment typically work in Integrated Product Teams (IPT) focused around commodity groups (e.g., landing gear) or product directorates (e.g., C-17 aircraft).  The primary focus of this activity is readiness and supportability.  Contracting systems are intricately integrated with a host of logistics and supply systems.  Sustainment contracting is primarily an Air Force Material Command (AFMC) responsibility. 2.2.3.2.  Test & Evaluation Contracting.  Provides full range of support to Air Force ranges and installations.  The test centers work with laboratories, product centers, sustainment centers, and operational commands to support developmental and operational test of new and modified systems and emergent technologies.  The focus of these centers is to evaluate performance capabilities and operational suitability of systems and equipment.  Test & Evaluation contracting focuses on supporting the test customer and ensuring that test facilities and equipment meets the needs of the customer.  Test activities often support joint, FMS, and commercial customers.  Test installations fall under the Air Force Test Center at Edwards AFB, and include Arnold Engineering Development Center and the Air Force Flight Test Center, both AFMC activities. 2.2.3.3.  Research and Development (R&D) Contracting.  Provides advanced technology study and development to identify and enhance technologies having military application.  The labs work in concert with program offices, universities, and other agencies to identify and advance high potential opportunities.  The focus of the labs is exploration and advancement of the state of the art in promising technologies.  Lab contracting is uniquely a responsibility of the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), a subcomponent of AFMC.  R&D contracting 25 assignments are very limited for 64P officers, although some R&D contracting opportunities exist within specialized contracting flights/squadrons. 2.2.3.4.  Classified Contracting.  64P officers in classified contracting positions provide support to classified programs and activities.  Specialized security clearances are required to work in this environment, limiting the speed and flexibility of assigning officers to these organizations.  Officers are assigned through the “Green Door” process and are typically assigned for a 4-year controlled tour due to the restrictive environment.  The focus of these units is support to their unique customer base.  These units are typically co-located with other contracting operations and may include some joint activities.  Brief periods in classified contracting positions will not hinder a 64P officer’s career progression.  In fact, obtaining higher security clearance levels required for classified contracting may create future opportunities.  As an alternative to a specific “Green Door” assignment, 64P officers may also be able to gain classified contracting experience at some operational contracting units that have classified billets which support both classified and non-classified units. 2.2.3.5.  Specialized Contracting.  Several Air Force units and activities provide specialized contracting services geared towards supporting the Air Force in a centralized manner.  Due to their specific focus, these organizations provide a great opportunity to gain experience in larger acquisition processes in a shorter amount of time.  As such they provide unique leadership opportunities.  Specialized units are focused on strategic support of specific systems or commodities for the Air Force.  The mission focus of each activity is unique to the customers of these organizations.  Some examples of specialized contracting units include:  771st Enterprise Sourcing Squadron (ESS) at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 772 ESS at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA)-Lackland, TX; 773 ESS at JBSA-Lackland, TX; 764 Specialized CONS (SCONS) at Kaiserlautern, Germany; 763 SCONS at Scott AFB, IL; 766 SCONS at Joint Base Pearl Harbor- Hickam, HI; and 338 SCONS at JBSA-Randolph, TX. 2.2.3.6.  Contract Administration.  64P officers may have the opportunity to gain valuable post-award administration experience with DCMA as an Administrative Contracting Officers (ACO).  DCMA’s distinct mission requires specialized skills in post-award contract administration.  64P officers serving in DCMA should seek to earn an unlimited ACO warrant after passing DCMA’s Contracting Officer’s Assessment Test (COAT) and Contracting Officer’s Review Board (CORB).  ACO warrants are based on Contract Management Office (CMO) requirements so it may not be possible for all officers to attain an ACO warrant. 2.2.3.7.  Career Broadening.  Career broadening assignments are designed to enhance an officer’s breadth of experience and diversity of thought.  Whether the assignment is through one of the SPEED programs, working on a combatant commander’s staff, earning an additional AFSC (e.g., 63A - Acquisition, 65F - Finance, 21R – Logistics Readiness, 21A – Aircraft Maintenance, or 16R - Operations Support), or working with an industry-leading company through the 10-month EWI program, the key in determining which career broadening assignment to pursue is to consider which opportunity will enhance the officer’s skills in a future, functionally-related assignment.  By having a career broadening assignment in a particular AFSC, the officer will be able to draw from that experience as a leader in a related assignment. Back-to-back career broadening assignments are strongly discouraged.  Contracting senior 26      leaders will take note of how well the 64P officer performs in a career broadening assignment so officers should continue to excel though they are outside of their core career field.  See Part II, Section C for more information related to SPEED programs. 2.2.3.8.  Executive Officer.  Executive officers oversee the information management activities for the commander/director and/or deputy commander/director.  They handle protocol duties as required; implement, direct and coordinate executive functions, services and activities; represent the commander with other agencies of all levels; and are responsible for unit programs and special projects as directed by the commander/director.  They manage, supervise and coordinate activities of command section staff ensuring proper development, implementation, and execution of policy and programs.  Lastly, they prepare executive correspondence and review staff documents prepared for the commander’s/director’s signature to ensure compliance with established procedures.  Executive officer positions in a systems assignment should also be limited to no more than one year in duration and, as with operational assignments, should be towards the end of the officer’s assignment.  The reason why serving as an executive officer should be limited is because experiences gained in the systems acquisition environment, particularly as a PCO and in source selections, acquisition planning, pricing, and negotiations, are experiences that will help the 64P officer in a future senior contracting official capacity. 2.2.3.9.  Deployments.  64P officers deploy in support of the warfighter.  The contingency contracting force is the fundamental reason why military personnel are in Air Force Contracting. Deployment experience(s) will ultimately help 64P officers to lead and support the training and preparation requirements of their Airmen.  64P officers should know their Air Expeditionary Force rotation period and prepare their families to meet the unique challenges that deployments present.  While deployed, officers should learn about the organizations and issues within the other Services and the supported task forces.  From a logistics perspective, deployed 64Ps should learn about operational contract support and what it takes to equip and sustain forces.  64P officers should seek opportunities to participate in exercises such as Operational Contract Support Joint Exercise (OCSJX), EAGER LION, and/or BRIGHT STAR since these exercises will help prepare 64P officers for deployments and other emergency or contingency operations. 2.2.3.10.  Senior Occupational Badge.  In accordance with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, 64P officers wear the senior acquisition badge after 7 years in the specialty. Figure 4.  Senior Acquisition Badge.  2.3. Operational Level (Approximately 10-20 Years).  Not to be confused with operational contracting, the operational developmental level is characterized by an increase in responsibility and authority with leadership and career broadening opportunities.  At this level, individuals will gain an understanding of the broader Air Force perspective and the integration of people and 27       their diverse capabilities to execute operations.  This level is where individuals transition from being a specialist to learning more complex contracting skills and functional competencies while gaining a breadth of experience that support contracting stakeholders.  Early in this level, individuals should complete their APDP Level III contracting certification requirements.  At this level of development, the 64P officer is considered a business advisor and subject matter expert in contracting.  Individuals should gain experience in supervisory positions, squadron command, AFICA OL or HAF staff positions, joint positions, and career broadening opportunities outside the career field.  Based on a thorough understanding of oneself as a leader and how one influences others, individuals will apply their skills in understanding organizational and team dynamics.  They will also continue to develop their personal leadership style and skills.  The Operational Sight Pictures in Figures 5 and 6 identify the distinct occupational competencies desired of successful commanders/supervisors and staff officers as well as the training, certifications, experience, and education individuals should strive to achieve through assignment and deployment opportunities. Figure 5.  Operational Level Sight Picture For Commanders and Supervisors.  28    Figure 6.  Operational Level Sight Picture For Staff Officers.  2.3.1.  Operational Level Career Opportunities. 2.3.1.1.  Staff.  These assignments are above the wing or center levels and they provide a strategic view of Air Force Contracting.  A staff assignment will provide rich experiences to develop and enhance critical thinking skills.  A 64P Action Officer will be challenged with developing courses of action and recommendations.  He/she will also be asked for creative insights to help solve complex problems.  Being aware of the challenges that these staff jobs present makes the officer a better leader when returning to the field.  HQ Air Force Contracting, or SAF/AQC, provides the strategic guidance for all of Air Force Contracting, encompassing AFMC, SMC, AFICA, and DRUs.  AFICA provides above-the-wing-level guidance to the operational squadrons from various operating locations across the Air Force.  The AFICA operating location staffs were part of the various MAJCOMs prior to AFICA stand-up; therefore, assignment to an AFICA operating location position is on par with a MAJCOM-level staff assignment.  Staff assignments can also include tours in the Office of the Secretary of Defense or joint environments.  Air Force 64P officers are in high demand for these opportunities, as these agencies have great confidence in a 64P officer’s technical and leadership abilities. 29     2.3.1.2.  Squadron Command (Sq/CC).  One of the major steps in the career of any officer in military service is the opportunity to command a unit or activity.  A command tour is unquestionably an important step in an officer’s professional progression.  Squadron command, and equivalent DCMA tertiary Contract Management Office (CMO) command, positions are valuable leadership opportunities within the contracting career field.  Not all officers will be afforded the opportunity to command. 2.3.1.2.1.  Most commonly, Sq/CC assignments are 2-year assignments for other AFSCs. However, due to the very limited 64P field grade officer (FGO) manning, 64P commanders should anticipate a 3-year Sq/CC assignment, regardless of whether it is the first or second command assignment.  This is the general rule and exceptions may exist for Intermediate (or Senior) Developmental Education.  Curtailing a Sq/CC assignment early requires CFM approval. Ideally, a 64P officer would serve only one tour as a Sq/CC, as this would enable the opportunity to develop in a different assignment other than serving as a commander again.  Uniquely qualified officers may be given more than one opportunity to command at the flight, squadron, or group level as a major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel due to shortages in 64P manning. 2.3.1.2.2.  Each spring, AFPC publishes the eligibility criteria for the following calendar year’s Squadron Command Candidate Board.  Current eligibility criteria may be found on the 64P Officer Assignments Team myPers website (see Part II, Section C for a hyperlink). 2.3.1.2.3.  The Air Force Contracting DT meets each summer to make recommendations on candidates that are eligible for command.  The DT begins the process with a meticulous records review of each eligible officer’s records, including the AFPC Record of Performance (ROP), Singe Unit Retrieval Format (SURF), Statement of Intent (SOI), and Senior Rater endorsement. The DT uses a whole person scoring concept for both command and selection to developmental opportunities.  Candidates are evaluated on consistency and quality of performance, professional qualities, demonstrated leadership, depth and breadth of experience, specific achievements, and education.  Contracting squadron command candidates and equivalent DCMA tertiary CMO command candidates are nominated to Wing or DCMA leadership by the DT and are expected to provide a resolute example of integrity, service before self, and excellence for squadron members and other squadrons to emulate.  See Part II, Section C for a link to AFI 1-1, Air Force Standards, and AFI 1-2, Commander’s Responsibilities. 2.3.1.2.4.  Air Force Command Insignia Pin.  In accordance with AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, the Air Force Command Insignia Pin is mandatory on ABUs and all blue uniforms and is worn by all eligible commissioned officers, in the rank of colonel and below, who are currently serving or have served in a command position. Figure 7.  Air Force Command Insignia Pin.  2.3.1.3.  Joint Positions.  Other joint activities which a 64P officer may be assigned to include the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), Army-Air Force Exchange Service (the Exchange), 30        Missile Defense Agency (MDA), Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), Special Operations Command (SOCOM), Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), Central Command (CENTCOM), Northern Command (NORTHCOM (Homeland Defense)), and a variety of joint systems program offices (e.g., Joint Strike Fighter).  The mission focus of each activity is unique to the customers of these organizations.  Officers selected for these limited joint positions may be awarded an additional AFSC and earn joint credit. 2.3.1.3.1.  Operational Contract Support (OCS) Planner. 2.3.1.3.1.1.  The OCS planner is responsible to the Combatant Commander to ensure a programmatic approach to OCS in Operational Plans, Concept Plans and Exercise Plans (OPLANs, CONPLANs, and EXPLANs).  The OCS planner supplements the main planning staff and is dedicated to OCS planning, providing expert level support to the COCOM or Service Component by infusing OCS doctrine into the commander’s plans across the range of military operations for all functional areas.  OCS planner actions support the COCOM’s participation in The National Defense Strategy and multilateral solutions for security, stability, and partnership efforts within the COCOM geographic area. 2.3.1.3.1.2.  The OCS planner provides senior level U.S. military operational and logistics planning experience to the COCOM’s area of operations.  The OCS planner is responsible to assure that those portions of the mission to be performed by contracted support are identified and included in the planning process.  OCS planners assist in oversight of OCS foundational activities throughout Phase 0 operations to ensure efficient and effective use of resources in support of day-to-day operations, and are responsible for integrating OCS joint logistics capability within the 18 deliberate planning efforts.  OCS planners participate as part of Joint Planning Groups (JPG), Operational Planning Group (OPG), and Operational Planning Team events in order to develop a thorough understanding of the strategic and operational environment and to ensure the planning team understands and includes key OCS inputs in the plan.  The OCS planner conducts continual reviews, analysis and updates on the combat, humanitarian, and disaster relief plans, annexes (e.g., Annex W), and appendices which guide all phases of the commander’s operations to support both contingency and non-contingency periods.  OCS planners must ensure that contracted support is identified in the appropriate plans and that a program management approach to contractor management, contract support and contract support integration is defined. 2.3.1.3.1.3.  Major duties of an OCS planner at the COCOM level are to ensure that OCS planning is fully integrated into COCOM command plans across all staff elements, the range of military operations, and joint capability areas.  Operating in a joint environment, the OCS planner will provide expert level advice and recommendations to ensure that supporting plans of military service components identify and plan for contracted support.  In addition, the OCS planner will ensure that operational contract support plans of other DoD agencies and multinational partners within the COCOM are reviewed, and that requirements definition, OCS program management, and contingency contracting are orchestrated and synchronized.  The OCS planner reviews contractor personnel management policies and procedures to ensure optimum fit and compliance with U.S. statutes and DoD policy and directives.  The OCS planner will also ensure that contract oversight and management and reporting plans, a subset of contractor 31      integration plans, are developed, integrated and current and advises command staffs of alternate acquisition strategies as required.  The OCS planner expertise is required throughout all operational phases. 2.3.1.3.2.  Explanation of “Joint” and “Joint Matters.”  There is a common misunderstanding between serving in joint organizations and serving in positions involving “joint matters,” and how that service translates to joint credit.  A joint organization is defined as an organization made up of members from two or more military departments.  Serving with officers from other Services, countries, or Government agencies provides officers with valuable “joint” experience; however, it does not equate to joint matters.  USC Title 10, Chapter 38 §668(a) and DoDI 1300.19, DoD Joint Officer Management Program, state that “joint matters” are related to the achievement of unified action by integrated military forces in operations conducted across domains such as land, sea, or air, in space, or in the information environment, including matters relating to: •  National military strategy. •  Strategic planning and contingency planning. •  Command and control of operations under unified command. •  National security planning with other departments/ agencies of the United States. •  Combined operations with military forces of allied nations. These joint matters positions are managed through the Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL).  For example, although DCMA is a Joint Combat Support Agency, it only has 12 JDAL positions. 2.3.1.3.3.  Earning Joint Credit.  Officers may receive joint credit via experience based joint duty credit (E-JDA) or standard joint duty assignments (S-JDA).  Members filling positions not listed on the JDAL may self-nominate for E-JDA.  See the Air Force Joint Officer Management Program Guide link in Part II, Section C to learn more about the E-JDA process.  S-JDAs are the traditional path to receiving joint credit and the following information applies only to S-JDA positions.  The JDAL is a list of S-JDAs approved by the USD (P&R) with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff.  Positions are identified as either regular JDA or critical JDA.  Critical JDA positions are ones requiring the incumbent to be previously trained, educated, and experienced in joint matters (i.e., must be designated as a joint qualified officer).  The following positions are excluded from the JDAL:  student positions/assignments; most instructor positions; positions within the Air Force; positions requiring grades O-3 and below.  Joint credit is accrued automatically and is tracked in both MilPDS and the Joint Management Information System (no action is required from the officer).  Officers serving in an S-JDA position must complete specific tour lengths in accordance with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction (CJCSI) 1330.05 Joint Officer Management Program Procedures and DoDI 1300.19 DoD Joint Officer Management Program.  Officers serving in a 36-month JDAL tour (e.g., major and above, and captains in major JDAL positions) must complete the required tour length of at least 3 years in the JDAL position or be approved for early release based on certain tour length exclusions.  See Part II, Section C for a link to the Air Force Joint Officer Management Program Guide. 32      2.3.1.4.  Tier 1 Positions.  Contracting has 14 “Tier 1” positions.  These lieutenant colonel contracting positions are located at AFMC and SMC centers.  Duty titles include Chief of Contracting, Division Chief, and Director of Contracting Operations.  These positions are significant leadership positions within systems contracting.  Criteria for assignment selection may include any of the following:  graduating Sq/CC, IDE/SDE graduate, short tour or overseas returnee, or 4 years time-on-station.  Selections are based on 64P Officer Assignment Team’s coordination with SAF/AQCX, nomination to the appropriate PK director, and then final approval by SAF/AQC. 2.3.1.5.  Materiel Leader.  As a career broadening opportunity for FGOs, the Material Leader (ML) Squadron Commander Board is open to eligible 64P officers who have already earned an APDP Level II certification in Program Management.  MLs are competitively-selected Lt Col program manager branch chiefs with the responsibility of a team of at least 15 authorizations in at least an Acquisition Category II (ACAT II) program.  In the acquisition community, an ML is equivalent to a squadron commander.  A 64P officer may receive a career field release to compete in the ML Squadron Commander Board and would be expected to return back to the contracting career field following the ML assignment.  64P officers that fill an ML position will earn the 63S0 AFSC. 2.3.1.6.  Deputy Mission Support Group Commander (MSG/CD).  Serving as an MSG/CD (AFSC 30C0) provides an officer with developmental experience that is helpful for later commanding a mission support group.  As such, it provides an appreciation and understanding of the issues associated with each of the installation support career fields.  Interested officers require a release from the career field to be considered for a 30C0 position.  Career field release will be considered on a case-by-case basis based on needs of the Air Force, needs of the career field, and officer development.  Officers can be assured that the Development Team and Career Field Manager will effectively balance an officer’s professional development desires with Air Force needs. 2.3.1.7.  Staff Level AFSC (64P4).  Fully-qualified 64P3 officers will be awarded the 64P4 AFSC, Contracting Staff Officer, upon assignment to a 64P position at a headquarters staff. When transitioning from a staff assignment to a non-staff coded position the 64P4 AFSC will remain in the officer’s SURF as a secondary AFSC, but their duty AFSC will change to match the position they are entering. 2.3.1.8.  Master Occupational Badge.  IAW AFI 36-2903, Dress and Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel, 64P officers wear the master acquisition badge after 15 years in the specialty (i.e., 15 years after earning the 64P1 designation). Figure 8.  Master Acquisition Badge.  33       2.4. Strategic Level (Approximately 20+ Years).  The strategic level features duty assignments that carry broad and significant responsibility and authority.  The strategic level typically applies to those with 20+ years of professional growth and development.  At the strategic level, individuals will combine highly developed functional and enduring competencies and apply broad professional leadership capabilities.  In order to achieve rank at the strategic level (i.e., colonel and above), an officer should develop and integrate a deep understanding of Air Force missions and how tactics, techniques, procedures, technology and people achieve synergistic results and desired effects, as well as how the mission operates with interagency and multilateral relationships.  At this level, individuals will focus on leading and directing exceptionally complex and multi-tiered contracting and acquisition operations and drive strategic acquisition strategies to lead organizations.  At the rank of colonel and above, individuals will be senior leaders of Air Force Contracting.  The strategic level challenges individuals to gain breadth of experience and training such as senior level educational and development programs to gain joint, inter-government, business, and international perspectives.  Individuals will also exemplify their deep functional expertise and display leadership skills for others to emulate.  In Figure 9, the Strategic Sight Picture contains the occupational competencies/capabilities required of Senior Contracting Officials (SCOs) and portrays the training, certifications, experience, and education opportunities available to Air Force Contracting senior leaders. Figure 9.  Strategic Level Sight Picture for Strategic Leaders. 34               2.4.1.  Colonel Assignments.  Colonels are in the top 1% of the Air Force and in the top 6% of the officer force.  AF/DPO, the Air Force Colonel Management Office (and also known as the “Colonels Group”), manages and makes all colonel assignments in the Air Force.  SAF/AQC, as the Functional Manager, provides input to the Colonels Group for 64P colonels.  Most CONUS assignments are generally 4 years with the exception of command, school, and joint assignments. Overseas tour lengths are determined by OSD policy.  SAF/AQCX manages the tenure process for both Critical Acquisition Position (CAP) and Key Leadership Position (KLP) assignments for contracting colonels. 2.4.1.1.  The 64P career field needs senior military contracting leadership. Although a colonel may retire with 3 years time-in-grade, the Air Force and the contracting career field depends on contracting colonels to apply their expertise in two colonel assignments. 2.4.1.2.  64P colonels will compete at the Command Selection Board (CSB) for wing and group commands and Senior Materiel Leader (SML) positions.  The CSB consists entirely of Air Force general officers – a four-star Board President, plus each MAJCOM/CV or his/her representative. The board screens records of all CSB-eligible officers to select candidates for command requirements that will be filled the following calendar years.  SMLs are also hired via the CSB candidate list.  DCMA has SML positions for colonels as well, which are similar to AF SML positions and offer command experience. 2.4.1.3.  SML positions are sub-categorized as SML (Lower Echelon) or SML (Upper Echelon) positions.  Lower Echelon SMLs are Division Chiefs that manage organizations with an ACAT I level budget and at least 50 authorizations.  Upper Echelon SMLs are director-level positions overseeing a directorate or higher priority division.  SML positions are typically designed as Critical Acquisition Positions and therefore carry a three year tenure requirement. 2.5. Educational Opportunities. 2.5.1.  Acquisition Professional Development Program (APDP) Certification. 2.5.1.1.  For contracting specific educational requirements, a 64P officer will complete the requisite coursework through Defense Acquisition University to qualify for contracting certifications.  There are three levels of certification, each requiring a specific amount of education, training, and experience. 2.5.1.2.  All DoD personnel filling acquisition positions have 24 months after entering the acquisition coded position to achieve the certification standards assigned to the position.  For example, a newly promoted captain, who is APDP Level I certified, may PCS to a systems contracting position that requires an APDP Level II certification.  The captain then must achieve APDP Level II within 24 months after assignment into the position.  See Part II, Section C for a link to DAU’s i-Catalog which lists APDP certification requirements. 2.5.1.3.  While the member’s priority for APDP classes is dependent upon his/her position’s APDP level requirement, 64P CGOs should progress towards APDP Level II certification.  The 35 member and supervisor should outline a reasonable timeline for achieving APDP Level II, keeping in mind the lead time required for in residence course registration and completion of prerequisites.  The focus should be on the member’s development and experiences, allowing time for the officer to apply what he/she has learned from DAU courses to job performance.      Neither an overly aggressive pace nor a prolonged timeline are helpful towards the member’s contracting development.  64P officers should seek to earn their APDP Level III in contracting as a senior captain or junior major. 2.5.1.4.  To maintain currency in the contracting environment, a 64P is also required to earn 80 continuous learning points every two years.  SAF/AQC memorandum dated 13 June 2013 encourages contracting personnel to target at least 25 of their next 80 points to be pricing related, if they have not already done so.  See Part II, Section B, paragraph 4 for more information on CL points and Part II, Section C for a link to the memo. 2.5.2.  Advanced Academic Degrees (AAD).  The Air Force places a high premium on education, both personal and professional.  Current CSAF direction states that a master’s degree is not expected until the colonel promotion selection board for Line of the Air Force (LAF) officers.  However, officers should consider whether attaining an advanced academic education will make them better performers in their jobs, i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and professional career fields.  If so, officers should pursue the education and let the improved performance show in their performance reports. 2.5.2.1.  Personal education includes pursuing an advanced degree.  From a contracting career field perspective, it is recommended that officers start their master’s program as early in their career as possible.  For comparison at the operational level of development, consider that contracting civilian counterparts (GS-1102) generally have a master’s degree.  NOTE:  When enrolling in a master’s degree program, 64P officers should consider asking their university if they provide credit hours for DAU courses. 2.5.2.2.  By completing the master’s program early, a 64P officer can apply skills and knowledge gained to his/her job related responsibilities.  Additionally, one’s responsibilities and expectations will continue to grow the longer one stays in the Air Force.  Therefore, it will likely be more difficult to complete a master’s degree as a senior captain/major than as a more junior CGO.  Commanders are encouraged to discuss personal timing considerations related to AADs with the officers they lead. 2.5.2.3.  Eligible 64P CGOs should consider applying for the Air Force sponsored AAD Program to earn a Master of Business Administration degree in Strategic Purchasing from the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, CA.  The program length is 18 months and officers selected for an AAD program will receive a follow-on assignment to an AAD coded position based on Air Force needs and officer professional development that capitalizes on the officer’s developmental education.  See Part II, Section C for a link to the AAD/SPEED programs. 2.5.2.4.  The base Education and Training office can provide information regarding tuition assistance.  Upon graduation of a graduate degree, it is imperative that 64P officers ensure their military personnel records are updated to reflect completion.  See Part II, Section C of this 36        CFETP for resources related to the Education and Training office and AFIT’s Officer AAD Records office. 2.5.2.5.  Officers may also earn a master degree in military sciences from Air Command and Staff College or Air War College through both residence and online programs. 2.5.3.  Developmental Education (DE).  DE includes learning the history and the strategic business of the Air Force.  For each rank, there is a commensurate level of DE to complete. •  Captain:  Primary Developmental Education (PDE, such as Squadron Officer School). •  Major:  Intermediate Developmental Education (IDE, such as Air Command and Staff College). •  Lt Col:  Senior Developmental Education (SDE, such as Air War College). 2.5.3.1.  For each level of DE, officers can complete the coursework through distance-learning (in correspondence) or in residence methods.  Based on current CSAF guidance, if officers are selected by a promotion board as an IDE select or SDE select, they will not be eligible to enroll in distance learning (DL) versions of that level of DE, unless they have been designated to attend a DE program that requires the completion of a DL course to obtain full Joint PME (JPME) program credit.  If an officer is not identified as a select, he/she is designated as a candidate and should enroll and complete the appropriate DE via distance learning.  A candidate’s eligibility to enroll in a distance learning course starts upon one’s promotion notification (not pin-on).  With regards to PDE, all captains will attend Squadron Officer School (SOS) in residence, with time- in-grade as the primary factor in determining the timing for attendance.  According to current CSAF guidance, only Line of the Air Force (LAF) captains with at least 7 years of commissioned service will be eligible to enroll in SOS by DL. 2.5.3.2.  Opportunities to attend in residence DE in the next two grades (major or lieutenant colonel) will be provided through the promotion board process to identify school selects or a candidate selection process for those who were not identified as school selects by the promotion board.  When the FGO promotion boards release their results, their published promotion list will include a column that identifies school select status.  The top tier of promotees will receive the school select designation, and these selects will have a guaranteed opportunity to attend DE in residence within the following 3 years (also known as looks).  Candidates also compete for senior rater nominations in each of their looks.  The Air Force Contracting DT reviews DE selects, and senior rater nominated candidates, and recommends officers to the DEDB for school selections. 2.5.3.3.  Performance during DE may lead to future opportunities.  Earned designations from DE attendance such as “distinguished graduate” or “outstanding contributor” help distinguish an officer for future job and promotion opportunities. 2.5.3.4.  The sooner an officer completes an advanced degree and appropriate level of DE (if he/she is a candidate); the sooner his/her supervisors can nominate the officer for exciting developmental opportunities.  See Part II, Section C of this CFETP for additional resources related to DE scheduling and available programs. 37              2.6. Professional Associations.  Professional affiliation may support and further a 64P officer’s professional growth by expanding a 64P officer’s technical expertise and network.  These associations provide networking opportunities for 64P officers to engage with industry and Government professionals about regulatory environment changes, best practices, and smart business decisions.  Professional associations related to the contracting career field may include, but are not limited to National Contract Management Association (NCMA), National Property Management Association (NPMA), and Institute for Supply Management (ISM).  See Part II, Section C for additional professional association resources. 2.7. Miscellaneous But Important Topics. 2.7.1.  Records Accuracy.  An officer’s record competes against other officers’ records; therefore, officers should keep their official records up-to-date.  This means reviewing one’s personnel records through the Personnel Record Display Application (PRDA), available through the Air Force Portal, on a periodic basis.  Pay close attention to missing OPRs and/or decorations.  Oftentimes a senior contracting leader is looking for the right officer to nominate for a pending vacancy and the senior leader might consider an officer who is not on the Vulnerable to Move List (VML).  By keeping the SURF, records, and ADP current, the officer is effectively postured for such consideration.  As an example, contracting CGOs should strive to earn their Master’s degree.  A CGO may also update his/her SURF to reflect Bachelors “Plus,” which is at least 15 semester hours or at least 22 quarter hours of graduate work above the baccalaureate level.  While a Bachelor “Plus” is not equivalent to a Master’s degree, it could serve as a discriminator in the officer’s record that he/she has completed a significant portion towards the Master’s degree.  As another example, FGOs should ensure that their SURF reflects completion of IDE and SDE.  Not having IDE or SDE completed could quite possibly be a way to “self-eliminate” from promotion consideration.  Deployment information appears on the member’s SURF.  (However, the Officer Selection Brief (OSB), which is the SURF-like document used at a promotion board, does not identify deployment information.  Keep this in mind when writing the PRF.  It may be helpful to articulate the number of deployments, progression of responsibility among deployments, and impact towards the warfighter on an officer’s PRF.)  Finally, officers should ensure their duty history accurately captures their assigned AFSCs and duty titles.  The duty history synopsizes the officer’s chronological progression of experiences at various levels and is therefore examined by senior leadership when contemplating future opportunities. 2.7.2.  Stratifications on Performance Reports.  Earning group and wing stratifications and awards illustrate that while the officer had the experience in certain assignments, he/she did well in comparison with peers, including peers both inside and outside of the 64P AFSC.  This comparison becomes important when meeting promotion boards since 64P officers compete against Line of the Air Force officers from other rated and non-rated career fields.  However, it is important to note that a 64P officer should not strive for stratifications/awards as his/her primary objective.  A 64P officer should focus on performing and developing his/her technical and leadership skills.  With this mindset and work ethic, stratifications and awards may be earned as a result.  See AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, para 1.12. for additional guidance on stratifications. 38       2.7.3.  Acquisition Examiner Review.  AFI 36-2406, Officer and Enlisted Evaluation Systems, authorizes the opportunity for the review of a ratee’s performance report by an Acquisition Examiner for situations when the none of the ratee’s raters or reviewers are contracting personnel (i.e., the ratee’s rater, additional rater, and reviewer are not contracting personnel).  If a 64P’s rater, additional rater, and reviewer are not contracting personnel, the 64P officer (ratee) is directed to request the Acquisition Examiner’s review of the performance report.  This review is to enable the proper oversight of the contracting function by a contracting member.  Military members should not be discouraged by their chain of command from requesting this review. 2.7.4.  Duty Titles.  Duty titles are important because they are a snapshot record of the types of experiences one has had throughout his/her Air Force career.  Duty titles comprise a large part of the OSB that accompanies the Record of Performance (ROP) at promotion boards.  Promotion board members are comprised of senior leaders across the Air Force from varying career fields. 2.7.4.1.  With that in mind, an “on track” duty title history shows progression in job level and responsibility and is meaningful to officers outside the 64P AFSC.  More specific (i.e., less general) duty titles can help.  For example, good progression can be shown in a series of duty titles such as “Contract Administrator,” “Assistant Team Lead, Construction Flight,” “Team Lead, Construction Flight,” “Assistant Branch Chief, Installation Support Contracts,” and then “Chief, Contract Review Committee.”  An ineffective duty title is one that only a contracting person could understand.  Try to avoid using duty titles with complex acronyms not generally known throughout the Air Force.  Generic duty titles, such as Buyer, Branch Chief, Contract Negotiator, Contract Manager, and Contract Management Officer may not effectively convey an officer’s level of responsibility.  Instead, use a more specific duty title to indicate the level of responsibility and scope, such as “Branch Chief, Installation Support Contracts” or “Deputy Chief, Contract Review Committee.”  Caveat:  Officers within their first or second year of contracting may have a generic duty title until they earn a leadership position within the unit. 2.7.4.2.  There are two different uses of the “Flight Commander” title.  A typical CONS is made up of flights, and an officer serving as a flight commander would then naturally have a duty title such as “Installation Support Acquisition Flight Commander.”  In some cases, a CONS may have 35 or less authorizations and therefore the unit is a flight (i.e., a CONF, not a CONS). In these cases, an officer leading the CONF is a commander with a “C” prefix AFSC (e.g., C64P3) and has a duty title such as “Commander, 123d Contracting Flight.” 2.7.5.  DT Vectors.  An officer’s vector communicates the strength of the officer’s record and the likely experiences that the officer should pursue to continue the officer’s professional development commensurate with his/her rank.  DT vectors are provided for major or lieutenant colonel selects and graduating squadron commanders or development education students. SAF/AQC is the final approval authority for each officer’s vector.  Officers will receive their vector via email from AFPC and the vector will remain on file in the officer’s AMS record. 39 2.7.6.  Mentoring. 2.7.6.1.  AFMAN 36-2643, Air Force Mentoring Program, defines mentorship as “a relationship in which a person with greater experience and wisdom guides another person to develop both personally and professionally.”  Mentoring is an essential ingredient in developing well rounded, professional, and competent future leaders for the Air Force.  The overall goal of mentoring is to help each individual reach his/her maximum potential, thereby enhancing the overall professionalism of the Air Force.  Mentoring is an inherent responsibility of leadership and is critical for the long term health of the contracting career field.  Supervisors, and all unit/program office leadership, must take an active role in the professional development of their subordinates in order to prepare them for increased responsibilities.  Supervisors should also assist their subordinates by providing realistic evaluation of both performance and potential. 2.7.6.2.  64P officers should make it a priority to seek advice from senior leaders.  The Air Force Contracting community is proud of its guiding principle of “Caring for one another by sharing knowledge and experiences.”  Senior leaders have rich insights and experiences that have been developed, learned, and passed down.  When seeking career mentoring from senior leaders have questions prepared, have a vision/plan for the next 5-10 years (military/civilian career, separation, retirement, etc.), and bring along the SURF, biography, and notes.  See Part II, Section C for useful links and information related to supervisory and mentoring responsibilities. 3. Career Path.  There is not one single, optimal career path that ensures career success.  A successful career path includes steady growth in job responsibility and professional development. Individuals should realistically review their strengths, weaknesses, short and long term goals, organizational needs, position availabilities, training, commitment, and promotion opportunities when developing career goals and plans.  How well an individual performs in their current position is the most important factor in determining future success. 3.1. Officer Development.  The officer’s role goes far beyond management of technical matters. An officer must also be a leader and effectively manage people, the driving force of our contracting capability.  The structure of the Air Force’s officer corps forms a pyramid which rises from a broad base of junior officers.  If there is to be a realistic flow of promotion up this pyramid, all who enter at the bottom cannot reach the top.  However, each officer does have the same promotion opportunity as his/her peers, and the contracting career field provides numerous ways to grow personally and professionally.  The Air Force Officer Contracting Career Pyramid (Figure 10) identifies the tactical (blue), operational (maroon), and strategic (green) levels of development and assignment opportunities from second lieutenant to the rank of lieutenant general.  Officer progression through these three levels allows officers to obtain the depth and breadth of experience required to progress and succeed at higher ranks.  Deployments are also a critical piece of a 64P officer’s professional development; therefore, deployment assignments commensurate with rank and development opportunities are shown on the left side of the pyramid.  Assignments in a variety of environments (operational, staff, joint, special duty, etc.) provide a breadth of professional development.  Breadth is an understanding of various specialties and environments across the Air Force and DoD, and is important for field grade officers seeking senior leadership positions.  Individuals can broaden professional development as they acquire expertise, knowledge, and skills in Air Force and DoD environments at the 40      operational, staff, joint, special duty, and other levels.  Individuals may also work with other Services or agencies.  This breadth of experience will assist individuals in developing as future Air Force and DoD leaders. Figure 10.  Air Force Contracting Career Pyramid For Officers. 4. Guidance Specific to Reserve 64P Officers. 4.1.  Assignments.  Reserve 64P officers through the rank of colonel should:  •  Ensure reserve duty contributions are sufficient to accrue satisfactory years toward retirement, remain competitive with peers, and allow for appropriate development. •  To help broaden career experience, consider a geographic or an organizational move. This could also involve changing reserve status (i.e., traditional reservist, individual mobilization augmentee, air reserve technician, or active guard reserve), which would widen the aperture of available opportunities. •  Focus on performance in the present assignment to gain depth of experience. •  Consider a career broadening assignment in a special duty career field such as 16XX (Operations Staff Officer), 97E (Executive Officer), 86M0 (Operations Management), and others. •  Consider volunteering for a deployment to broaden career experience. •  Return to the primary AFSC within a reasonable time after taking a career broadening assignment. •  Compete for a command position when available. 41       •  Apply for Key, Command, and Joint (KCJ) assignments (colonel selects and higher only). 4.2. Education.  Reserve officers ranked by the DT in the top tier of their grade within the career field should consider applying for in residence DE at the next Reserve Developmental  Education Designation Board (RDEDB).  All reserve officers should complete the next level of  DE to grow in their military career.  Captains should complete PDE by approximately 5 years  time-in-grade.  Lieutenants through captains may also consider applying for an AFRC  Professional Development Center (PDC) course such as Leadership Challenge Course I, a 5-Day  course held at HQ AFRC, Robins AFB, GA.  AFRC PDC courses such as Junior Officer  Leadership Development course, International Junior Officer Leadership course, and Reserve  Officer Development course are available for captains.  Majors should complete IDE by 5 years  time-in-grade, and Lt Cols should complete SDE by 4 years time-in-grade.  Majors and  lieutenant colonels may also apply for PDC courses such as Leadership Challenge Course II (a 5-  Day course held at HQ AFRC, Robins AFB, GA), Leadership Today and Tomorrow (a 4-day  course typically held in Washington, D.C.), Canadian Forces Staff College (a 2-year distance  learning course with 2 weeks in-residence in Toronto, Canada), Marine Corps Command and  Staff College (a 12-month course with 11 weeks in-residence in Quantico, VA), or joint courses  such as the NATO Reserve Forces Integration course.  Other PME courses available to majors through colonels include:  the Advanced Joint Professional Military Education at Norfolk, VA; the Reserve Components National Security Course in Washington, D.C.; National Security Decision Making; Strategy & Policy; and Joint Military Operations.  PME courses reserved for colonels include NATO Senior Officer Policy course and the NATO Senior Reserve Officer course.  Reserve officers are recommended to complete an AAD at the earliest opportunity because of the complexities they will encounter in the contracting/acquisition environment with increasing responsibility. 4.3. Performance Reports, Decorations, and Duty History.  Reserve officers should: •  Consistently review and update personnel records (e.g., Special Experience Identifiers, Certifications, etc.) and correct or address any inconsistencies. •  Ensure duty titles are specific enough to accurately reflect current duties and responsibilities. •  At the supervisor’s discretion, reservists are eligible for Air Force decorations at least every 3 years per AFI 36-2803 AFRC SUP 1, paragraph 2.3. •  Submit a Reserve Officer Development Plan (R-ODP), which is the tool to communicate career desires to senior leaders. prior to the annual DT. •  Update the R-ODP with specific goals and submit to a coordinator for recommendations •  Utilize DT vectors as feedback to help improve performance by seeking job opportunities that reflect progression of increased responsibilities. 42     SECTION C – PROFICIENCY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 1. Purpose. Proficiency training requirements in this career field are defined in terms of tasks and knowledge requirements. This section outlines the specialty qualification requirements for award and retention of each AFS level. The specific task and knowledge training requirements are identified in the CTS and Training Course Index at Part II, Section A and B of this CFETP. 2. Specialty Qualification Requirements. 2.1. Knowledge.  64P officers must know and stay current of contracting process fundamentals, federal acquisition and contracting directives and publications, budgeting and funding procedures, and contract pricing. 2.2. Education.  A baccalaureate degree in the disciplines of business, economics, math, or engineering is desired.  A minimum of 24 semester credit hours (or the equivalent) of study from an accredited institution of higher education in any of the following disciplines:  accounting, business, finance, law, contracts, purchasing, economics, industrial management, marketing, quantitative methods, and organization and management is mandatory. 2.3. Training. 2.3.1.  For award of the AFSC 64P1, it is mandatory to complete the Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRC-102) Course, or SAF/AQC-approved equivalent. 2.3.1.  For award of the AFSC 64P3, it is mandatory to: •  Complete the Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRC-102) Course, or SAF/AQC- approved equivalent, and •  Demonstrate proficiency on all core tasks listed in their ITP (see Part I, Section A, paragraph 4.3.2. for guidance on the development of ITPs). 2.4. Experience.  For award of AFSC 64P3, a minimum of 12 months of contracting experience is mandatory. 2.5. Training Sources.  A list of training sources to support education and training is in Part II, Section B and Section C. 2.6. Implementation.  Refer to Part II. 43             SECTION D – RESOURCE / TRAINING CONSTRAINTS Centrally funded DAU training authorizations are governed by SAF/AQH memo, “Prioritization of Defense Acquisition University (DAU) Training,” dated 2 May 2014.  See Part II, Section C for a link to the policy memorandum and other resources associated with overcoming resource or training constraints. 44   PART II SECTION A – COURSE TRAINING STANDARD (CTS) 1. Purpose.  64Ps in qualification training will demonstrate the desired learning outcomes contained in this CTS. 2. Documentation.  Supervisors are responsible for documenting subordinates’ training in the 64P officer’s individual training plan as well as maintaining subordinates’ training records and reviewing these records during feedback sessions.  Training records will be transferred between losing and gaining units to ensure continuation of 64P officer proficiency training.  Third party task certification is not required. 2.1. Column 1.  “Task, Knowledge, and Technical References.”  This column lists the tasks, competencies, and knowledge necessary for officers to complete qualification training.  It also provides technical references (TR) that support the requirement for each task or competency. 2.2. Column 2.  “Core Tasks.”  This column identifies with an “X” those tasks and competencies from Column 1 that are considered core tasks to the contracting career field. 2.3. Column 3.  “Certification For Qualification Training.”  This column is used by supervisors to record proficiency of tasks and competencies identified by the CFETP, as well as any tasks a supervisor considers necessary for an individual’s duty position. 2.4. Column 4.  “Proficiency Codes.”  This column indicates the proficiency level that must be demonstrated by the officer in qualification training in order for the supervisor or commander- approved trainer to certify completion of the task or competency.  Units are responsible for placing proficiency codes in column 4 at the time of unit/contracting office MTL creation.  Those proficiency codes annotated with an asterisk in column 4 have been taught at MRC-102 to the proficiency level indicated; therefore, supervisors may take that into their discretion when training and certifying those tasks.  See Attachment 1 for definitions and examples of proficiency codes. 3. Qualitative Requirements. 3.1. Attachment 1 contains the qualitative tasks that have been identified by the career field as critical components of a 64P’s education and training.  Commanders/directors (i.e., COCOs) should review Attachment 1 against the mission and workload available within their specific organization and tailor the Attachment 1 listing to create unit/contracting office specific MTLs comprised of the various tasks/competencies to ensure 64P officers are exposed to, and are able to demonstrate proficiency for, a variety of tasks/competencies during their assignment to the unit.  The tailoring actions of commander/directors (i.e., COCOs) should have the overall goal to seek the best match of the training requirements unique to the officer’s current position in parallel with the master list of qualitative tasks and competencies that have been identified by the career field as critical components of a 64P’s education and training in Attachment 1. Commander/directors will create, from the unit MTL, individual training plans for 64P officers 45           that meet the applicability criteria provided in Part I, Section A, paragraph 4.7.1.  For example, operational contracting units may focus on simplified acquisition procedures, base construction, base operating services, and other contracting actions that can be taught through experiential (i.e., “hands on”) learning. 3.2. Certain tasks are considered “core tasks.”  These tasks are so vital to a 64P’s development that they are mandatory for inclusion in a unit’s MTL.  Core tasks are identified with an “X” in column two of Attachment 1.  While core tasks are considered mandatory for inclusion in the MTL, not all officers will be required to be certified on these tasks.  As noted in Part I, Sec A, para 4.7.1., only 64P1s seeking a 64P3 AFSC are required to demonstrate proficiency on core tasks.  For 64P3 officers, commanders/directors (i.e., COCOs) have the latitude to determine which tasks (core and/or non-core) must be certified during the assignment to the organization. This may be based on the need for refresher training, depth and breadth on certain tasks/competencies, or other rationale that drives a need for inclusion in the officer’s individual training plan. 4. Qualification Training Requirements.  Training methodologies will vary based on trainer and officer strengths, weaknesses, interests, learning preferences, experience levels, and other factors.  Trainers should collaborate with officers in qualification training to determine how to blend each individual’s preferences to ensure the purpose of the training – the officer’s learning – is properly accomplished.  Trainers are encouraged to see Part II, Section C for training materials related to contracting, career development, leadership, and other topics. 4.1. Trainers should consider: •  Their own learning style. •  Other types of learning styles. •  Preferred learning styles of the officers they will train. •  Goals of the training session (i.e., learning new skills, learning new techniques for old skills, knowledge, awareness). audience demographic. •  Experience level, preferred learning modes (e.g., active or reflective learner), and •  Resources/materials available (i.e., space, budget, time, and training materials). 4.2. Training methodologies may include, but are not limited to: •  On-the-job (hands on) training with extensive supervisor and peer feedback (e.g., preparation of contracting documents or site visits). •  Classroom or instructor led training (supported by personal experiences). • Interactive sessions that include quizzes, small group discussions, case studies, question and answer sessions, role playing scenarios, problem-solving games, structured exercises, and/or demonstrations. •  Videoconferencing such as Defense Connect Online (DCO) sessions. 46        Course Requirements Experience Requirements Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRC-102) Course Completed Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRC-102) Course Completed None 12 months of contracting and demonstration of proficiency on all core tasks identified in Attachment 1 See Note 5. AFSC Designator Table.

It does not denote additional specialty qualifications.  47 SECTION B – TRAINING COURSE INDEX 1. Purpose.  This section of the CFETP identifies additional training courses available for the career field. 2. Air Force In-Residence Courses. 2.1. Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRC-102).  The course is for new officer accessions, officer cross flows, and new civilian hires into the contracting career field (64PX or 1102).  The course educates and prepares officers and civilians to assume positions in operational, systems, logistics, and research and development contracting.  Course curriculum includes the Air Force business environment, applicable laws and regulations, and “hands on” lab exercises using applicable contract writing systems.  Completion of MRC-102 provides students with knowledge, skills, and abilities leading to APDP Level I certification in contracting and (depending on the officer’s graduation date) fulfills CON 090, CON 100, CON 121, CON 124, and CON 127 requirements.  Additional courses which are required to attain APDP Level I certification may be found on DAU’s iCatalog (see Part II, Section C for a link).  Successful completion of the course authorizes award of the entry-level AFSC and basic acquisition badge. Course Number  Title MRC-102  Mission Ready Contracting Officer (MRC-102)  Wright-Patterson AFB, OH       Location 3. Defense Acquisition University (DAU).  DAU provides a full range of basic, intermediate, advanced, certification and assignment specific courses to support the position requirements, career goals and professional development of the AT&L Workforce.  In addition, DAU offers a wide range of online continuous learning modules to meet currency needs of the acquisition professional.  Once the officer masters contracting tasks and competencies, it is highly recommended that the officer take classes in other acquisition functional areas to gain a better understanding of those areas and how they integrate with the acquisition process.  Non- continuous learning modules require supervisory approval.  Officers may find the latest Core Plus guidance for recommended modules according to assignment type.  Full information, course descriptions, and APDP certification requirements can be found at DAU’s iCatalog (see Part II, Section C for a link).  Officers may sign-up for DAU courses (classroom, web-based, and continuous learning modules) at AcqNow (see Part II, Section C for a link). 4. Continuous Learning (CL).  In accordance with DoDI 5000.66, Operation of the Defense Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Workforce Education, Training, and Career Development Program, paragraph E2.2.8.1., members shall earn 80 continuous learning points  (CLPs) every 2 years.  Members of the AT&L Workforce and their supervisors shall establish  individually tailored plans for continuous learning in order to increase functional proficiency,  maintain currency, increase leadership and cross functional competencies, and keep pace with  initiatives in the dynamic AT&L environment.  The Core Plus Development Guides shown in the  DAU iCatalog outline which CL courses are most applicable to a particular type of assignment.  Air Force acquisition personnel are required to record CL points for credit using the online ACQ Now CL system (see Part II, Section C for a link).  Additionally, in accordance with the 48        SAF/AQC memo dated 13 June 2013, Air Force contracting personnel are encouraged to target 25 of their next 80 CL points on pricing courses, if they have not already done so (i.e., this is a one-time requirement).  The intent of the memo is to improve the contracting workforce’s knowledge and level of proficiency with regards to contract pricing.  5. Contingency Contracting Training.  All Air Force contracting units will follow SAF/AQC policies for Contingency Contracting Officer (CCO) training found on the Air Force Contracting Central SharePoint (https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10059/afcc/Pages/default.aspx).  Units will ensure that all CCOs are trained following  this policy.  Commanders are encouraged to create/adjust their CCO training as necessary for their unit personnel.  Units may also use CCO training materials located at https://cs.eis.af.mil/sites/10074/afcc/afica/DS/Exp_Ops_Cell/SiteAssets/Standardized_CCO_Training.aspx to supplement their training.  Unit/contracting office leadership may determine the frequency and duration of CCO training.  Units will document all CCO training on  AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training.  At a minimum, each CCO’s  AF Form 1098 will include the training topic covered, name of officer in qualification training,  signature of certifying official, and date training was completed.  Supervisors must maintain a  folder for each officer they supervise and the folder must contain both the AF Form 1098 and the individual’s training plan (created from Attachment 1 of this CFETP).  49

This column lists the tasks, competencies, and knowledge necessary for officers to perform duties in the entry, intermediate, and expert levels of the contracting profession.  It also provides technical references (TR) that support the requirement for each task or competency. Core Tasks.  This column identifies with an “X”, those tasks and competencies from Column 1 that are considered core tasks to the contracting career field.  All core tasks shall be used in a unit’s/contracting office’s MTL for 64P1 officers seeking the 64P3 AFSC. Certification For Qualification Training.  This column is used by supervisors and commander-approved trainers to record completion of tasks/competencies identified by the CFETP, as well as any tasks a supervisor considers necessary for an individual’s duty position. Proficiency Codes.  This column indicates the proficiency level that must be demonstrated by the officer in qualification training in order for the supervisor or commander-approved trainer to certify completion of the task/competency.  Units are responsible for placing proficiency codes in column 4 at the time of unit/contracting office MTL creation.  Those proficiency codes annotated with an asterisk in column 4 have been taught at MRC-102 to the proficiency level indicated; therefore, supervisors may take that into their discretion when training and certifying those tasks.  See the Proficiency Code Key below.
