This  instruction  provides  cyberspace  operations  examiners  and  crew  members with  procedures  and  evaluation  criteria  used  during  performance  evaluations  on  operational cyberspace weapon systems. For evaluation purposes, refer to this AFI for evaluation standards. Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of crew members. In addition to general criteria information and grading criteria, this  AFI  provides  specific  information  and  grading  criteria  for  each  crew  position,  special mission  qualification  (SMQ),  instructor  upgrade  qualification,  and  stan/eval  examiner  (SEE) objectivity evaluations. 1.2.  Recommending  Changes.  Submit  recommendations  for  improvements  to  this  Instruction on  AF  Form  847  through  the  chain  of  command  to  HQ  USAF/A3CX/A6CX.  Approved recommendations will be collated into interim or formal change notices, and forwarded to HQ 24 AF/A3T for HQ 24 AF/A3 approval. 1.3.  Waivers.  Unless  another  approval  authority  is  cited  ("T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3"),  waiver authority for this volume is the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).  Submit requests for waivers using AF FM 679 through the chain of command to the appropriate Tier waiver approval authority. If approved,  waivers  remain  in  effect  for  the  life  of  the  published  guidance,  unless  the  waiver authority specifies a shorter period of time, cancels in writing, or issues a change that alters the basis for the waiver. 1.4.  Standardization  and  Evaluation  Examiners  (SEEs)  will  use  the  grading  policies contained  in  AFI  17-202V2  and  the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  Instruction  for  conducting  all weapon  system  performance,  Crew  Training  Device  (CTD),  and  Emergency  Procedures Evaluations (EPE). 1.4.1.  All evaluations assume a stable platform and normal operating conditions. Compound emergency procedures (more than one simultaneous emergency procedure) will not be used. (T-2) 1.4.2.  Each squadron will design and maintain evaluation profiles for each mission/weapon system  that  includes  information  on  each  crew  position.  These  profiles,  approved  by  the Operations Group Stan/Eval office (OGV), should outline the minimum number and type of events  to  be  performed/observed  in  order  to  satisfy  a  complete  evaluation.  Evaluation profiles  will  incorporate  requirements  set  in  the  applicable  grading  criteria  and  reflect  the primary unit tasking. (T-3) 1.4.3.  All evaluations fall under the Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN) or Spot (SPOT) categories listed in  AFI  17-202V2. For dual/multiple qualification or difference evaluations (an  evaluation  that  covers  major  changes  in  an  existing  capability,  e.g.  a  major  upgrade  to sensor suite adding that adds or alters capabilities) that do not update an eligibility period, list as  "SPOT"  on  the  front  of  the  AF  Form  4418,  Certificate  of  Cybercrew  Qualification,  and explain that it was a difference evaluation under "Mission Description." (T-2)  AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 5 1.4.3.1.  Schedule  all  evaluation  activity  on  one  mission/sortie  to  the  greatest  extent possible. All  performance phase requirements should be accomplished during a training (or  operational  if  training  not  available)  mission/sortie.  If  a  required  event  is  not accomplished  during  a  mission/sortie,  Operations  Group  commander  (OG/CC)  is  the waiver  authority  for  the  event  to  be  completed  in  the  CTD.  This  may  be  delegated  no lower  than  the  Squadron  commander  (SQ/CC)  unless  otherwise  authorized  in  position specific chapters of this Instruction. (T-3) 1.4.3.2.  During  all  evaluations,  any  grading  areas  observed  by  the  evaluator  may  be evaluated. If additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 4418. (T-3) 1.4.3.3.  This Instruction contains a table of requirements for the written requisites and a table  for  the  grading  criteria  for  various  evaluations.  Each  table  may  include  a  "Note" which refers to  a  general  note found in  the individual grading  criteria, and/or a number which  refers  to  a  note  shown  below  the  table.  To  complete  an  evaluation,  all  areas annotated with an "R" must be successfully completed. (T-3) 1.4.3.4.  Unit  examiners  may  give  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization  to  include administering  evaluations  between  AFSPC,  AFRC  and  ANG  provided  written agreements/understandings  between  the  affected  organizations  are  in-place.  Written agreements/understandings shall be reviewed and updated annually. (T-3) 1.4.4.  Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective  action and such deviations  do not  jeopardize safety or the mission. Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining the overall grade. The SEE will state the examinee’s overall rating, review with the examinee the area grades assigned,  thoroughly  critique  specific  deviations,  and  recommend/assign  any  required additional training. (T-2) 1.4.5.  SEEs will not evaluate students with whom they have instructed more than 50% of the qualification/upgrade  training  performance  events  without  SQ/CC  approval.    SEEs  will  not evaluate  students  they  recommended  for  end  of  training  qualification/upgrade  evaluation unless approved by the SQ/CC. (T-3) 1.4.6.  All  crewmembers  for  the  mission/sortie  (to  include  students,  instructors,  examinees, and  evaluators)  will  participate  in  and  adhere  to  all  required  mission  planning,  mission briefing, mission execution, and mission debriefing requirements. All crewmembers must be current  on  Crewmember  Information  Folders  (CIF)  and  meet  all  Go/No-Go  requirements IAW  17-202  series  instructions,  this  Instruction,  and  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance prior to operating, instructing, or evaluating on the weapon system. (T-2) 1.5.  General Evaluation Requirements 1.5.1.  Publications  Check.  In  units  where  crewmembers  are  individually  issued  operating manuals,  checklists,  crew  aids,  etc.,  for  use  in  conducting  operations,  a  publications  check will  be  accomplished  for  all  evaluations.  The  publications  check  will  be  annotated  in  the Comments block of the AF Form 4418 only if unsatisfactory. List of Effective Pages (LEP) and annual “A” page checks in individually issued operating manuals must be accomplished, documented,  and  current.  OGV  will  list  the  required  operating  publications  each  crew member is responsible for in the local CIF Library and/or local supplement to AFI 17-202V2.  6 AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 In  units  where  such NOTE: issued  but  made available/accessible for common use, the unit Stan/Eval office will list those items (version and  date)  and  ensure  the  accuracy  and  currency  of  the  information  contained  in  those resources for common use. (T-2) resources  are  not individually 1.5.2.  Written Examinations. 1.5.2.1.  The requisites in  Table 1.1 are common to  all ACD crew positions and will be accomplished  IAW  AFI  17-202V2,  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance,  and  unit directives.  These  will  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  mission/sortie  performance  phase unless  in  conjunction  with  a  No-Notice  (N/N)  QUAL.  NOTE:  A  N/N  evaluation conducted  in  the  examinee’s  eligibility  period  and  meeting  all  required  QUAL  profile requirements  allows  the  examinee  to  opt  for  the  N/N  evaluation  to  satisfy  a  periodic QUAL,  in  which  the  examinee  may  complete  written  and  Emergency  Procedures Evaluation  (EPE)  requisites  after  the  performance  phase.    However,  the  written examination(s) and EPE must be completed prior to the examinee’s expiration date. (T-2) 1.5.3.  EPE. Every Qualification evaluation which updates an expiration date will include an EPE. Qualification EPEs will evaluate the crewmember’s knowledge and/or performance of emergency  procedures,  to  include  use  of  emergency  equipment.    Use  the  Emergency Procedures/Equipment  grading  criteria  for  all  emergency  situations  given.  Use  Systems Knowledge/Operations grading criteria to evaluate general systems operation.  An EPE will be  accomplished  orally  and  may  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  mission  with  any  unit  SEE conducting a scenario-based evaluation using question/answer (Q&A) techniques, preferably during  the  SEE  pre-brief  with  the  examinee.  Units  will  determine  scenarios  for  EPEs.  The SEE will assign an overall EPE grade (1 or 3). Document the accomplishment and result of the EPE in the Written Phase block of Section II Qualification on the AF Form 4418. (T-2)   AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 7 Table 1.1.

Units may administer OPEN BOOK exams at their discretion, however it is not required.  If utilized, exams shall consist of 50-100 questions derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. OG/OGV will determine the necessary number of questions to be included for each weapon system and crew position. (T-2)  2. The CLOSED BOOK exam consists of 25-50 questions derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. OG/OGV will determine the necessary number of questions to be included for each weapon system and crew position. (T-2)  3.  The EPE is required for all INIT QUAL and subsequent periodic QUAL evaluations covering duties in the member’s primary crew position.  See paragraph 1.5.3 for procedures/requirements for conducting EPEs. (T-2)  4.  The Special Mission Qualification (SMQ) upgrade CLOSED BOOK exam is a separate closed book exam consisting of 25-50 questions specific to the SMQ derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives.  For initial SMQ evaluations that are not combined with the member’s periodic QUAL (for the primary crew position), the SMQ exam is the only required exam.  Subsequent (periodic) SMQ evaluations should be combined with the member’s periodic QUAL evaluation, therefore, requiring the written requisites to consist of the OPEN BOOK, CLOSED BOOK, and applicable SMQ exam(s). (T-2) 1.5.4.  QUAL  Evaluations.  These  evaluations  measure  a  crewmember’s  ability  to  meet grading areas listed on Table 1.2 at the end of this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 of this instruction.  IAW AFI 17-202V2 and weapon system-specific guidance, QUAL evaluations may  be  combined  with  MSN  evaluations.  When  practical,  QUAL  evaluations  should  be combined with Instructor evaluations, as applicable for the crew position. (T-2) 1.5.5.  MSN Evaluations. IAW AFI 17-202V2 and lead MAJCOM guidance, the requirement for  a  separate  MSN  evaluation  may  be  combined  with  the  QUAL  evaluation.  The  various 8 AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 procedures  and  techniques  used  throughout  the  different  weapon  system  variants  are managed  through  a  training  program  which  results  in  a  mission  certification  or  culminates with a SMQ. Mission certifications will be IAW 17-202 Vol 1, AFI 17-2ACD Vol 1, and all applicable supplements and will be documented in the appropriate training folder.  MSN and SMQ  evaluation  grading  areas  are  also  listed  on  Table  1.2  at  the  end  of  this  chapter  and defined in Chapter 2 of this instruction. (T-2) 1.5.5.1.  For  crew  members  who  maintain  multiple  mission  certifications,  recurring evaluations  need  only  evaluate  the  primary  mission  events  as  long  as  currency  is maintained in all other required training events. (T-2) 1.5.6.  Instructor  Evaluations.  Grading  areas  for  these  evaluations  are  listed  on  Table  1.2  at the  end  of  this  chapter.  See  Chapter  3  of  this  instruction  for  amplified  information  and grading area definitions. (T-2) 1.5.7.  SEE  Objectivity  Evaluations.  Grading  areas  for  these  evaluations  are  listed  in  Table 1.2 at the end of this chapter. See Chapter 4 of this Instruction for amplified information and grading area definitions. (T-2) 1.5.8.  No-Notice Evaluations. OG/CC will determine no-notice evaluation procedures/goals. (T-3) 1.6.  Grading Instructions.  Q, Q- and U ratings are used for specific evaluation areas.  Q1, Q2, and Q3 are used for the overall evaluation rating. While the three-level  grading system (Q, Q-, U) is used for most areas, a Q- grade will not be used for Critical evaluation areas. 1.6.1.  Critical Area/Subarea. Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by the examinee in order to successfully and safely achieve the mission/sortie objectives and complete  the  evaluation.  These  events,  if  not  adequately  accomplished  could  result  in mission failure, endanger human life, or cause serious injury or death. Additionally, critical areas/subareas  apply  to  time-sensitive  tasks  or  tasks  that  must  be  accomplished  as expeditiously  as  possible  without  any  intervening  lower  priority  actions  that  would,  in  the normal  sequence  of  events,  adversely  affect  task  performance/outcome.  If  an  examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be "Q-3." Critical areas are identified by "(C)" following the applicable area title. (T-2) 1.6.2.  Major  Area/Subarea.  Major  areas  are  events  or  tasks  deemed  integral  to  the performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and mission execution. If an examinee receives a "U" grade in a non-critical area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical  area  or  areas  may  still  receive  a  "Q-1"  overall  grade  at  evaluator  discretion.  An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. Major areas are identified by "(M)" following the applicable area title. (T-2) 1.6.3.  Minor Area/Subarea. Minor areas are rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system  operations  that  by  themselves  have  little  or  no  impact  on  mission  execution.  Minor areas are identified by "(m)" following the applicable area title.  AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 9 1.6.4.  If an examinee receives  a  "U"  grade in  a  non-critical  (major or minor) area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SEE, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. (T-2) 1.6.5.  The SEE must  exercise judgment  when the wording of  areas is  subjective and when specific situations are not covered. (T-2) 1.6.6.  Evaluator  judgment  will  be  the  final  determining  factor  in  deciding  the  overall qualification level. (T-2) Table 1.2.

The  grading  criteria  in  this  chapter  apply  to  evaluations  for  ACD  crew commanders  and  operations  controllers  and  were  established  by  experience,  policies,  and procedures set forth in weapon system manuals and other directives. Evaluators must realize that grading criteria contained herein cannot accommodate every situation. Written parameters must be tempered with mission objectives and, more importantly, mission/task accomplishment in the determination of overall crew performance. Requirements for each evaluation are as follows: 2.2.  Qualification Evaluations: 2.2.1.  Written Examination Requisites: See Table 1.1. (T-3) 2.2.2.  Emergency Procedures Evaluations: See paragraph 1.5.3. (T-3) 2.2.3.  Performance  Phase:  Areas  1  through  19  in  Table  1.2  under  ACD-CC  (Crew Commander  qualification)  or  ACD-OC  (Operations  Controller  qualification)  will  be evaluated, unless not applicable as noted. (T-3) 2.3.  Mission  Certifications.  Mission  Certifications  ensure  that  individuals  are  capable  of performing  duties  essential  to  the  effective  employment  of  the  weapon  system.  Mission Certifications  are  accomplished  IAW  local  training  requirements  and/or  SQ/CC  directions. Mission certification events are normally performed during Qualification evaluations, but may be performed on any mission/sortie with an instructor certified in that mission. (T-3) 2.4.  General  Crew  Position  Evaluation  Criteria.  The  following  general  evaluation  grading criteria  are common to  all crew positions, regardless  of SMQ  and additional  certifications, and will be used for all applicable evaluations: 2.4.1.  AREA 1, Mission Planning (M) 2.4.1.1.  Q.  Led or contributed to mission planning efforts IAW procedures prescribed in applicable guidance manuals, instructions, and directives. Planning adequately addressed mission  objectives  and/or  tasking.  Plan  adequately  considered  intelligence  information, weapon  system  capability/operating  status,  and  crew  composition/ability  with  minor errors/deviations/omissions that did not impact mission effectiveness. Verified review of all  CIF  Vol  1,  Part  B  items  and  complied  with  Go/No-Go  procedures  prior  to  mission start. Was prepared at briefing time. (T-3) 2.4.1.2.  Q-.  Errors/deviations/omissions  had  minor  impact  on  mission  effectiveness  or efficiencies,  but  did  not  impact  mission  accomplishment  or  jeopardize  mission  success. (T-3) 2.4.1.3.  U.  Failed  to  adequately  lead  mission  planning  effort.    Failed  to  review  CIF and/or  comply  with  Go/No-Go  procedures.  Failures  to  comply  with  procedures prescribed  in  applicable  guidance  manuals,  instructions,  and  directives  contributed  to significant  deficiencies  in  mission  execution  /  accomplishment.  Failed  to  lead  or participate  in  all  required  briefings  and/or  planning  meetings  without  appropriate approval. (T-3) 12 AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 2.4.2.  AREA 2, Briefing (M) 2.4.2.1.  Q.  Led  or  contributed  to  briefing  effort  as  appropriate.  Well  organized  and presented  in  a  logical  sequence,  appropriate  timeframe,  and  professional  manner. Effectively  incorporated  briefing/training  aids  and  presented  all  training  events  and effective  techniques  required  for  accomplishing  the  mission.  Briefing  encompassed  all required directives.  Minor errors/omissions/deviations  did  not impact  mission  effectiveness  or  efficiencies. Crewmembers  clearly  understood  roles,  responsibilities,  and  mission  requirements.  Briefed CIF Vol 1 Part B and crew Go/No-Go status. (T-3) topics/areas discussion prescribed IAW of 2.4.2.2.

(T-2) to  an 3.3.  Instructor  Qualification  Evaluations:  When  possible,  units  should  strive  to  combine instructor  evaluations  (initial  and  recurring/periodic)  with  periodic  QUAL  evaluations.  Instructor  evaluations  can  only  be  combined  with  QUAL  evaluations  when  the  examinee  is  in their periodic QUAL eligibility period. There is no eligibility period associated with an Instructor Qualification,  however,  Instructor  qualifications  will  expire  after  the  17th  month  from  the previous Instructor Qualification Evaluation. See paragraph 3.5 for documentation guidance. (T-2) 3.3.1.  Initial  Instructor  evaluations  should  be  conducted  with  a  student  occupying  the applicable  crew  position  whenever  possible.  Recurring  or  periodic  Instructor  Evaluations may be conducted with the SEE role playing as the student. (T-2) 3.3.2.  The instructor examinee will monitor all phases of the mission from an advantageous position  and  be  prepared  to  demonstrate  or  explain  any  area  or  procedure.  The  SEE  will particularly note the instructor's ability to recognize student difficulties and provide effective, timely instruction and/or corrective action. The SEE should also evaluate the grade assigned and the completed grade sheet or event training form for the student on all initial instructor checks. (T-2) 3.3.3.  The  student  will  perform  those  duties  prescribed  by  the  instructor  for  the mission/sortie being accomplished. If an actual student is not available, the SEE will identify to the examinee (prior to the mission) the level of performance expected from the SEE acting as the student. If this option is utilized, at least one event or briefing must be instructed. (T-2) 3.3.4.  Periodic  instructor  evaluations  will  be  administered  in  conjunction  with  required periodic qualification evaluations. The examinee must occupy the primary duty position for an  adequate  period  of  time  to  demonstrate  proficiency  in  the  crew  position  with  required qualification  evaluations.  All  instructor  evaluations  will  include  a  pre-mission  and  post-mission briefing. (T-2) 3.3.5.  Awarding a "U" in any of the Instructor Grading Criteria areas will result in a Q-3 for the overall instructor grade. The overall grade for the instructor portion of the evaluation will be no higher than the lowest overall grade awarded under QUAL. (T-2) 3.4.  Instructor  Evaluation  Grading  Criteria.  All  Instructor  Evaluation  Criteria  must  be observed and graded to ensure a complete evaluation. Specific requirements for each evaluation are as follows: AFI17-2ACDV2  27 APRIL 2017 23 3.4.1.
