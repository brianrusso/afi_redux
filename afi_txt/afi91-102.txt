Pre-Operational Safety Study (POSS) examines safety procedures for new or modified systems, and aspects of the CONOPs that will affect the safety of the nuclear weapon system to  determine  if  the  DoD  nuclear  weapon  surety  standards  are  met.    This  is  the  first opportunity to draft weapon system safety rules for a new system. 14.5.  Operational  Safety  Review  (OSR)  examines  all  operational  aspects  of  a  nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon system to determine if the DoD four surety standards identified in paragraph  2  are  met.    The  weapon  system’s  first  OSR  takes  place  during  the  second  year 10 AFI91-102  12 APRIL 2017 after the initial approval of safety rules.  Recurring OSRs shall be conducted at intervals not to exceed 5 years from the start of the weapon system’s preceding OSR. 14.6.  Special  Safety  Studies  (SSS)  investigate  unsafe  conditions  revealed  by  operational experience;  accidents and/or incidents; modifications (including software), tests,  or retrofits involving nuclear safety or nuclear security; significant changes in the concept of operations; additional  new  equipment  and/or  weapons;  proposed  changes  to  nuclear  weapon  system safety rules; or inactive storage of nuclear weapons. 14.6.1.  Any  NWSSG  voting  member/organization  may  request  a  SSS.    The  member shall  provide  the  request  in  writing  to  the  NWSSG  Chairperson  for  final  determination and scheduling.  The request shall contain the rationale and scope of the proposed SSS. 14.6.2.  MAJCOMs  must  identify  any  planned  configuration  or  operations  change  that potentially impacts nuclear certified weapon systems (e.g. modification to nuclear storage facility,  Remote  Visual  Assessment  CONOPs,  etc.)  via  a  Nuclear  Certification  Impact Statement in accordance with AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program.  AFSEC/SEW will determine whether to conduct a SSS. 15.  NWSSG Study/Review Process: 15.1.  The  NWSSG  Support  Staff  is  responsible  for  scheduling  studies  and  reviews.    The Support Staff provides an AFSEC/SEW-approved 5-year OSR schedule to the Office of the Assistant  Secretary  of  Defense  for  Nuclear  Matters  (OASD  (NM))  and  maintains  the schedule on the AFSEC web site. 15.2.  Pre-NWSSG Study/Review Time Lines. 15.2.1.  Six  months  prior  to  the  study/review  –  Appropriate  MAJCOM  submits  its OPDD, including CONOPs, to AFSEC/SEW when a TNSA is required.  If a TNSA is not required, submit Concept of Operations, only. 15.2.2.  Four  months  prior  to  the  study/review  (18  months  for  NATO  operations)  – AFSEC/SEW notifies NWSSG members of dates and location(s) of the study/review. 15.2.3.  Three  months  prior  to  the  study/review  (12  months  for  NATO  operations)  – AFSEC/SEW  presents  draft  agenda  to  MAJCOM  and  NWSSG  Voting  Members,  and requests briefings/demonstrations for Phase I and Phase II. 15.2.4.

MAJCOMs  will  coordinate  required  briefings  and  demonstrations  with subordinate units supporting Phase II and NWSSG Support Staff. 15.3.7.  The NWSSG is  disbanded when the chairperson accepts  and signs the NWSSG Report. 16.  Safety  Rules  Processing  Responsibilities.  DoDM  3150.02  requires  prompt  report processing (See Attachments 3 and 4 for post-study timeline). 16.1.  NWSSG Support Staff will create a NWSSG Report. Once all NWSSG members sign this  report  and  all  outstanding  issues  for  the  study  have  been  resolved,  the  NWSSG  report cannot be changed except to correct minor administrative errors. At this point, the NWSSG Chairperson will consider the study complete. 16.2.  If the NWSSG Report includes proposed rules for new systems or proposed changes to current rules, AF/SE will prepare a separate Air Force Safety Rules Package and draft AFI to implement the proposed rules.  AF/SE will submit the NWSSG Report, and if required, the draft  Rules  Package  for  HAF  2-letter  coordination  and  will  notify  OASD  (NM)  of completion  of  the  study/review.    Additionally,  the  draft  AFI  will  be  submitted  to  any additional offices as required by AFI 33-360 for coordination. 16.3.  AFSEC/SEW will adjudicate all comments and draft the AF NWSSR within 4 weeks of receipt of the HAF 2-letter coordination. 16.4.  The AF/SE will distribute the Air Force NWSSR and, if required, the Air Force Rules Safety Package to appropriate agencies. 16.4.1.  If no Safety Rules Package required, AF/SE will distribute the AF NWSSR along with  a  memorandum  to  OASD  (NM)  certifying  the  current  rules  are  sufficient.    A courtesy copy of the memorandum will also be sent to CJCS. 16.4.2.  If a Safety Rules Package is required, AF/SE will distribute the AF NWSSR and Rules  Package  to  OASD(NM),  voting  member  organizations,  OPRs  for  approved recommendations, and the NWSSG technical advisors.  OASD(NM) will coordinate with DTRA, CJCS, and DOE/National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), as described in DoDM 3150.02. 16.5.  Upon  notification  of  rules  approval  by  the  USD  (AT&L),  AFSEC/SEW  will  include these  rules  in  the  appropriate  weapon  system  91-series  AFI.    Unless  otherwise  specified, AFI91-102  12 APRIL 2017 13 safety  rules  and  revisions  to  approved  safety  rules  in  the  AFI  shall  be  implemented  by appropriate agencies within 30 days of approval. 16.6.  AF/SE will publish the approved rules following AFI 33-360 guidance for publication and  forward  to  all  appropriate  agencies  (responsible  MAJCOM  safety  offices  and  system program offices) directing immediate implementation. 16.7.  If circumstances necessitate approval of proposed safety rules before completion of the formal  coordination  process,  AF/SE  will  request  interim  approval  from  the  USD(AT&L) according to the procedures in DoDM 3150.02. 16.7.1.  Interim approval of the safety rules is effective for 6 months and does not negate the requirement for final processing of the Safety Rules Package. 16.7.2.  If final processing of the safety rules is not completed within the 6-month period, AFSEC/SEW must request an extension from OASD (NM). Section E—Supporting Documents and Briefings 17.  Air Force Data Package.  The Air Force Data package consists of the materials provided to NWSSG voting members prior to the NWSSG study/review for their preparation and use during the study or review.  Package includes: 17.1.  Operational Plan Data Document (if applicable – MAJCOM). 17.2.  Weapon system CONOPs (MAJCOM). 17.3.  TNSA for studies and certain reviews (AFNWC). 17.4.  Technical  description  of  the  weapon  system  and  its  system  safety  features,  when  not included in TNSA (AFMC/MAJCOM). 17.5.  Draft  or  current  safety  rules  located  in  the  appropriate  weapon  system  91-series  AFI (AFSEC/SEW). 18.  NWSSG  Report.  An  NWSSG  Report  is  a  summary  of  NWSSG  proceedings.  It  is  not  a technical or engineering source document (DoD RCS: AT&L (A) 1994). The report will follow the format contained in DoDM 3150.02, Appendix 1 and contain the following: 18.1.  Executive  Summary  will  summarize  the  study  results  and  include  an  appraisal statement  as  to  whether  the  system  meets  DoD  nuclear  weapon  system  surety  policy  and standards. 18.2.  Study  Overview  will  summarize  the  study’s  scope,  background,  purpose,  and comments on the impact of safety on the system’s concept of operations. 18.3.  Findings,  Recommendations  and  Corrective  Actions  Section  will  state  facts  or conclusions  regarding  the  nuclear  safety  of  the  weapon  system  and  recommendations  to enhance safety following the requirements within DoDM 3150.02. 18.3.1.  A  finding  or  recommendation  must  be  approved  by  a  majority  of  the  NWSSG voting members. 18.3.2.  Priority assignments for NWSSG recommendations: 14 AFI91-102  12 APRIL 2017 18.3.2.1.  Immediate  Action.  (USE  OF  THE  NUCLEAR  WEAPON  SYSTEM  IS IMMEDIATELY  RESTRICTED  UNTIL  RECOMMENDED  ACTIONS  ARE COMPLETED.)  Reserved  for  recommendations  made  to  correct  deficiencies  that prevent  the weapon system  from  meeting one or more of the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Surety Standards.  It either restricts certain operations of the nuclear weapon system or completely prohibits use of the system until approved recommendations are complied with. 18.3.2.2.  Urgent Action. (USE OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPON SYSTEM MAY BE RESTRICTED  IF  APPROVED  RECOMMENDATIONS  ARE  NOT  COMPLIED WITH  BY  THE  SUSPENSE  DATE.)  Reserved  for  those  recommendations  which conclude  that,  while  the  system  currently  meets  required  safety  standards,  prompt corrective  actions  are  required  to  ensure  no  violation  of  any  of  the  DoD  nuclear weapon  system  surety  standards  occurs  in  the  future.    Peacetime  restriction  of  the weapon  system  may  be  warranted,  if  approved  recommendations  are  not  complied with  by  the  suspense  date  or  if  an  approved  extension  to  the  suspense  date  is  not granted. 18.3.2.3.  Time  Compliance.  (USE  OF  THE  WEAPON  SYSTEM  IS  NOT RESTRICTED.) Reserved for recommendations that  simply enhance nuclear surety.  These recommendations are intended to make the system better and do not imply any failure to meet existing safety standards.  The weapon system may be operated while action  is  being  taken  to  comply  with  an  approved  recommendation.    Failure  to comply by the stated suspense date will not restrict use of the weapon system. 18.4.  Reiterate  applicable  recommendations  for  the  weapon  system  made  during  previous studies or reviews for which corrective actions have not been completed. 18.5.  Draft  Safety  Rules  for  new  systems  or  proposed  changes  to  existing  rules,  which  are NWSSG  recommendations  for  safe  operations  of  the  weapon  system,  based  upon  NWSSG findings during the study/review. 18.5.1.  A safety rule must be approved by a majority of the NWSSG voting members. 18.6.  An  Addendum  of  Minority  Opinions  may  be  included.    It  shall  be  appended  to  the NWSSG  Report  if  agreement  is  not  reached  by  the  NWSSG  through  discussion  and deliberation  and  those  in  the  minority  deem  such  an  addendum  is  appropriate.    The  format will be the same as the findings and recommendations of the basic report and signed by each member supporting the minority position. 18.6.1.  The Minority  Opinion shall be submitted for inclusion into the  NWSSG Report prior to adjourning the Phase III meeting and shall be made available for all members to review. 19.  Air Force Nuclear Weapons System Surety Report (NWSSR).  The NWSSR presents the Air  Force  assessment  of  whether  the  weapon  system  meets  the  four  DoD  surety  standards identified in paragraph 2.  The NWSSG Report is the basis for the Air Force NWSSR.  The Air Force NWSSR consists of the following: 19.1.  The  Executive  Summary  will  summarize  the  Air  Force  position  on  the  study  results and  include  an  appraisal  statement  that  assesses  whether  or  not  the  weapon  system  meets AFI91-102  12 APRIL 2017 15 DoD  nuclear  weapon  system  surety  policy  and  standards.    If  there  are  differences  in  any portion of the Air Force NWSSR and the NWSSG Report, the Executive Summary will note the differences and rationale for disagreement. 19.2.  The Assessment Section will include evaluations and analyses to support the Air Force appraisal statement in the Executive Summary. 19.3.  The Findings, Recommendations, and Corrective Actions Section will: 19.3.1.  List  NWSSG  findings,  recommendations,  and  minority  opinions,  and  indicate approval or disapproval of each recommendation with rationale. 19.3.2.  List  corrective  actions  with  a  timeline  that  the  Air  Force  will  implement  for approved recommendations. 19.3.3.  Provide  recommendations  on  the  retention,  modification,  or  retirement  of  the system. 19.4.  The NWSSG Report is included as an enclosure to the Air Force NWSSR. 20.  Air Force Safety Rules Package.  Parts A and B will be consistent with that provided in the Air Force Data Package.  The Air Force Safety Rules Package includes: 20.1.  Executive  Summary:    An  appraisal  of  whether  or  not  the  weapon  system  meets  the DoD  weapon  system  safety  policy  and  standards;  differences  between  the  NWSSG  Report and the NWSSR; and a synopsis of the proposed safety rules or changes to current rules. 20.2.  Part A:  Technical Description of the weapon system and Concept of Operations. 20.3.  Part B:  Safety Features incorporated in the weapon system. 20.4.  Part C:  Proposed Safety Rules. 21.  Operational  Plan  Data  Document  (OPDD).  The  OPDD  is  the  operating  command’s statement  of  how  the  command  operates  and  maintains  (or,  if  applicable,  for  a  new  or significantly  modified  weapon  system,  how  the  command  plans  to  operate  and  maintain)  the nuclear weapon system being studied by the NWSSG.  In addition, the OPDD serves as a source document for the TNSA or abbreviated TNSA when required. 21.1.  The OPDD describes: 21.1.1.  The  nuclear  weapon  system’s  current  or  proposed  (for  new  or  significantly modified weapons systems) concept of operations. 21.1.2.  General operations commonly performed regardless of geographical location. 21.1.3.  Significant variations of the general operations. 21.1.4.  Normal operations in the stockpile-to-target sequence during peacetime, wartime, and periods of increased hostilities. 21.1.5.  Operations conducted under contingency plans. 21.2.  An OPDD will be provided to the NWSSG by the operational MAJCOM.  AFSEC will notify  the  MAJCOM  12  months  prior  to  the  study  if  an  OPDD  is  required  to  support  an NWSSG  study  or  review.    New  or  modified  OPDDs  are  required  to  be  reviewed  by  the NWSSG prior to implementation. 16 AFI91-102  12 APRIL 2017 21.2.1.  The MAJCOM will summarize operations, refer to applicable source documents for  greater  detail,  and  include  all  desired  operational  and  system  capabilities  in  the OPDD.    The  weapon  system  safety  rules  proposed  by  the  NWSSG  may  not  allow  all desired  capabilities,  but  they  will  not  be  considered  if  not  included  in  the  OPDD.  Commands  CANNOT  add/significantly  change  operational  capabilities/plans  after  the USD(AT&L) approves the safety rules without an NWSSG study/review. 22.  Technical  Nuclear  Safety  Analysis  (TNSA).  The  TNSA  is  prepared  by  the  Air  Force Nuclear Weapons Center in accordance with AFI 63-125 and serves as an independent technical analysis of the nuclear weapon system. 22.1.  Personnel  who  prepare  the  TNSA  shall  maintain  independence  from  organizations directly  responsible  for  designing,  developing,  producing,  maintaining,  operating,  or providing logistics for the weapon system under evaluation. 22.2.  The TNSA: 22.2.1.  Describes the weapon system in depth. 22.2.2.  Has  a  safety  and  security  compliance  matrix  that  shows  how  weapon  system features meet the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Surety Standards (see Attachment 2). 22.2.3.  Contains a comprehensive engineering analysis of the weapon system design. 22.2.4.  States how the weapon system does or does not meet the DoD Nuclear Weapon System Surety Standards in both normal and credible abnormal environments. 22.2.5.  Identifies  deficiencies  and  recommended  corrective  actions  for  the  weapon system  to  comply  with  AFI  91-107,  Design,  Evaluation,  Troubleshooting,  and Maintenance Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems, AFMAN 91-118 Safety Design and Evaluation  Criteria  for  Nuclear  Weapon  Systems,  AFMAN  91-119,  Safety  Design  and Evaluation  Criteria  for  Nuclear  Weapon  Systems  Software,  and  DoD  S-5210.41-M_AFMAN 31-108. 22.2.6.  Assesses  physical  security  features  planned  for  the  weapon  system.    If appropriate,  include  an  examination  of  security  measures  for  non-fixed  site  operations, identify security deficiencies, and propose necessary corrective actions. 22.2.7.  Includes a qualitative risk assessment of the weapon’s likelihood of violating any of the DoD nuclear weapon system surety standards or causing plutonium scatter. 22.3.  Prepare  a  preliminary  TNSA  for  an  initial  safety  study.    Prepare  a  final  TNSA  for  a preoperational safety study.  Note:    An abbreviated TNSA may be used for a special safety study,  an  interim  safety  study,  a  preliminary  safety  study  or  as  required  by  the  NWSSG Chairperson.  It is limited in scope and only covers the specific study topic. 22.4.  Provide a preliminary or final TNSA, as appropriate, no later than 30 days before the first NWSSG meeting. 23.  Support Briefings: 23.1.  The  operational  command,  development  agency,  TNSA  authors,  subject  matter experts, and contractors brief the NWSSG. 23.2.  NWSSG Support Staff tells the agencies what topics they must cover in the briefing. AFI91-102  12 APRIL 2017 17 23.3.  Topics should include, but are not limited to: 23.3.1.  History of Safety Studies, Operational Safety Reviews, and Safety Rules. 23.3.2.  NWSSG recommendations disapproved by HAF. 23.3.3.  Deficiency report history. 23.3.4.

Section F—Actions Required on NWSSG Recommendations Approved by the HAF. 24.  Implementing HAF-Approved Recommendations. 24.1.  Designated  action  agencies  must  implement  all  safety  recommendations  approved  by the HAF.  Each action agency will: 24.1.1.  Notify  AFSEC/SEW  of  the  agency’s  office  of  primary  responsibility,  telephone number (DSN, if available), and point of contact. 24.1.2.  Send  AFSEC/SEW  a  status  report  of  NWSSG  Studies  and  Reviews, Recommendations,  and  Safety  Rules  by  15  May  and  15  November  of  each  year.    The agency will begin reporting after receiving the Air Force NWSSR and include a schedule for completing each action item identified in each recommendation. 24.1.3.  Request  NWSSG  voting  member  approval,  through  AFSEC/SEW,  to  close  the recommendation with  justification for closure.  All  corrective actions must be approved by an NWSSG majority vote before closure can be granted by the NWSSG Chairperson. A recommendation is not closed until AFSEC/SEW notifies the action agency by signing the closure request letter. 24.1.4.  During  the  study,  agencies  can  request  NWSSG  voting  member  approval  for closure  by  a  majority  vote,  but  must  provide  AFSEC/SEW  with  substantiating information prior to meeting. 24.2.  AFSEC/SEW  will  monitor  agency  actions  (through  semiannual  status  reports)  and publishes  a  semiannual  status  of  recommendations.    Additionally,  AFSEC/SEW  at  the discretion of the Chairperson can conduct semi-annual NWSSG meetings to review the status of  recommendations  and  receive  updates  from  OPRs.    An  annual  status  report  is  due  to OASD (NM) with informal copies provided to Joint Staff and DOE by 1 July.  ANDREW M.
