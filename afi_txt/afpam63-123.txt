Product Support Business Case Analysis (PS-BCA) Pamphlet Overview. 1.1.1.  Product  Support  Business  Case  Analysis  (PS-BCA)  Pamphlet.  This  is  designed  to assist  the PS-BCA Team  in  developing comprehensive Product  Support  (PS) strategies that achieve  the  optimal  balance  between  warfighter  capabilities  and  affordability  (i.e.,  best-value).    The  pamphlet  covers  key  areas  that  the  PS-BCA  Team  needs  to  consider  when developing  an  effective  PS-BCA.    The  pamphlet  provides  a  standardized  format,  assists  in developing  and  evaluating  courses  of  action  (COAs),  recommends  useful  decision  support methodologies that enhance defendable decision making processes, and provides guidance on developing  the  PS-BCA  report.    Additionally,  the  pamphlet  provides  examples  and  best practices, identifies existing laws, integrates Department of Defense (DoD) guidance located in  the  DoD  Product  Support  BCA  Guidebook  (April  2011),  and  supplements  existing  Air Force  (AF)  Manuals    (AFMANs)  such  as  AFMAN  65-510,  Business  Case  Analysis Procedures  (October  2010).    The  focus  of  the  pamphlet  is  on  Major  Defense  Acquisition Programs  (MDAPs),  however,  the  techniques  provided  can  also  be  applied  to  non-MDAPs and Major Automated Information Systems (MAISs) that require PS-BCAs. 1.2.  Business Case Analysis (BCA). 1.2.1.  A Business Case Analysis (BCA) is a decision support document that identifies COAs and  then  presents  convincing  business  (both  financial  and  non-financial)  impacts,  risks, sensitivities, and technical arguments for selecting a specific COA that will achieve desired objectives.  A BCA provides a fair and objective study that leads to a decision, not justify a decision after the fact.  AFMAN 65-510 provides specific information on conducting a BCA to support United States Air Force (USAF) command, management, and financial decisions.  A BCA, while often informally referred to as an economic analysis or cost-benefit analysis, is  a  specific  type  of  analysis  formally  defined  by  the  AF  and  distinct  from  the  AF  defined economic analysis. 1.2.2.  Introduction.  Defines  what  the  business  case  is  about  (subject),  why  (purpose)  it  is necessary, what are the objectives, and who the decision maker is for the BCA. 1.2.3.  Problem Statement. Concisely defines the problem, requirement or opportunity being analyzed.  What problem is trying to be solved and is it realistic?  What is the  scope of the analysis?  The problem statement helps define the analysis framework. 1.2.4.  Methods and Assumptions. States the analysis methods and rationale that will fix the boundaries  of  the  business  case  (the  costs  and  benefits  examined  over  what  time  period). This section also outlines the rules for deciding what belongs in the analysis and what does not.  Assumptions on what is believed to be true of a current or future state of affairs are also identified. 1.2.5.  Business  and  Operational  Impacts.  Documents  financial  and  non-financial  business and operational impacts for each COA. 8 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 1.2.6.  Risk  Analysis.  Evaluates  the  probability  of  negative  events  occurring  in  each  COA and their impact on desired objectives. 1.2.7.  Sensitivity  Analysis.  Demonstrates  how  the  BCA  results  are  affected  by  changes  in key variables such as assumptions, weightings, and key data drivers in the analysis. 1.2.8.  Recommendation  and  Implementation  Plan.  Recommends  a  preferred  COA  and  the action plan required to achieve desired objectives. 1.2.9.  Per the DoD Product Support BCA Guidebook and AFMAN 65-510, a BCA does not replace  the  judgment  of  the  decision  maker,  but  rather  provides  an  analytic  and  uniform foundation that allows decision makers to make informed decisions.  A BCA can vary in size and  scope,  is  developed  in  an  unbiased  manner,  and  is  not  constructed  to  justify  a preordained decision.  A key element in constructing an effective BCA is acquiring sufficient data  from  reliable  sources  and  then  analyzing  the  information  utilizing  a  consistent methodology.    With  the  same  data  and  comprehensive  documentation,  readers  not  familiar with the analysis should be able to replicate the analysis and arrive at the same conclusions. 1.3.  Product Support Business Case Analysis (PS-BCA). 1.3.1.  Decision  Support  Document.  A  PS-BCA  is  a  decision  support  document  that  assists Product Support Managers (PSMs) in developing COAs for product support strategies using the  best  value  approach  which  incorporates  Integrated  Product  Support  (IPS)  elements.  Attachment 1 (Terms) defines best value per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). 1.3.2.  PS-BCA Process. The PS-BCA is an iterative process that incorporates organizational or  programmatic  changes.    PS-BCAs  can  be  used  for  a  number  of  purposes  to  include  the following: 1.3.2.1.  Determine whether or not to change Product Support Strategy (PSS) 1.3.2.2.  Determine whether or not to invest in product support 1.3.2.3.  Determine whether or not to select among COAs 1.3.2.4.  Validate  proposed  scope,  schedule,  or  budget  changes  during  the  course  of  the program 1.3.3.  Product  Support  Decisions.  The  PS-BCA  supports  major  product  support  decisions, especially  those  that  result  in  new  or  changed  resource  requirements.    Program  Managers (PMs) are responsible for deploying the PSS and monitoring its performance according to the Life  Cycle  Sustainment  Plan  (LCSP).    While  the  PS-BCA  assists  in  the  leaders’  decision making process, it does not supersede or overturn other statutory requirements (e.g., 10 U.S. Code § 2464 - Core, 10 U.S. Code § 2466 - 50/50). 1.3.4.  Major  Elements.  The  PS-BCA  has three  major  elements:  purpose,  process components,  and  quality  foundation  (see  Figure  1.1.)  that  work  together  to  ensure  the  PS-BCA targets the relevant subject matter, analyzes and reports the results, and integrates into the organization’s mission and vision. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 9 Figure 1.1.  Product Support BCA Elements.  1.3.4.1.  Purpose. Identifies the problem statement, objectives, metrics, desired outcomes, and  requirements.    The  purpose  annotates  what  problem  the  PS-BCA  is  attempting  to solve and how to measure success. 1.3.4.2.  Process  Components.  Subsections  of  the  PS-BCA  that  directly  execute  and report  on  analytical  actions.    PSMs  should  refer  to  the  DoD  PS-BCA  Guidebook  and AFMAN 65-510 to determine what to include in  the components section.  Of particular note,  within  the  implementation  plan,  a  PS-BCA  should  include  predetermined  off-ramps.  These off-ramps are actions to be taken when the desired objectives are not being achieved for the selected COA. 1.3.4.3.  Quality  Foundation.    Directly  affects  the  quality  and  completeness  of  the analysis.  This  section consists of research, due  diligence (verifying the  accuracy of the information), governance (provides oversight), and data management. 1.3.5.  Integrated  Product  Support  (IPS)  Elements.  The  PS-BCA  is  used  to  analyze  a program’s PSS and are represented by the 12  IPS elements,  as identified in  Appendix A of the  DoD  Product  Support  Manager  Guidebook.    Each  program  is  unique  and  the  IPS elements  to  be  analyzed  are  dependent  upon  the  specific  sustainment  requirements  of  the weapon  system.    Rationale  should  be  provided  for  each  of  the  12  IPS  elements  whether utilized  or  not  within  the  PS-BCA.    The  IPS  elements  categorize  major  support  areas  and provide  standardized  definitions.    One  recommended  approach  in  addressing  the  12  IPS elements. The 12 IPS elements are 1) Product Support Management; 2) Design Interface; 3) Sustaining Engineering (SE); 4) Supply Support; 5) Maintenance Planning and Management; 6)  Packaging,  Handling;  Storage  &  Transportation;  7)  Technical  Data;  8)  Support Equipment;  9)  Training  and  Training  Support;  10)  Manpower  and  Personnel;  11)  Facilities and Infrastructure; and 12) Computer Resources.  Of the 12 IPS elements, those most often compared between COAs within a PS-BCA are the following: 10 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 1.3.5.1.  Product  Support  Management.    Focuses  on  integrating  all  sources  of  product support, public and private, within the scope of a product support arrangement. 1.3.5.2.  Sustaining  Engineering.    Examines  the  technical  tasks  (i.e.,  engineering  and logistics  investigations  and  analysis)  required  to  ensure  continued  operation  and maintenance of a system.  See AFI 63-101/20-101,  Chapter  5, “Systems  Engineering,” for  guidance  on  the  engineering  requirements  that  PMs  will  address  to  ensure  the continued operation and maintenance of a system. 1.3.5.3.  Supply Support.  Focuses on procuring, producing, and delivering products and services to customers as well as the flow of funds. 1.3.5.4.  Maintenance Planning and Management.  Focuses on the maintenance of parts, assemblies,  sub-assemblies,  and  end  items.    This  might  include  manufacturing  parts, making modifications, testing, and reclamation, as needed. Figure 1.2.  Four Major Areas for 12 IPS Elements.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 11 1.3.5.5.  The  PS-BCA  should  follow  the  cost  estimating  guidance  outlined  in  the  DoD “Cost  Assessment  and  Program  Evaluation  (CAPE)  Operating  and  Support  Cost Estimating Guide 2014” and be structured according to the IPS elements and the CAPE Cost elements. 1.3.5.5.1.  Best Practice. The PMO should also plan to acquire government data rights and delivery of technical data as required by 10 U.S. Code § 2320.  Prior to MS B, the Program Management Office (PMO) should develop a PS-BCA data collection plan that  identifies  the  data  requirements  and  data  system  access  requirements  for  the analysis.    Information  such  as  demand  history  for  supply  chain  (which  parts  are replaced  or  repaired  and  how  often),  maintenance  repair  procedures/process,  and product support performance metrics (e.g., Customer Wait Time (CWT), engineering request response time) are types of information that can be captured.  In addition, cost reporting and priced bill  of materials  with  the  appropriate  amount of  fidelity should be obtained if available. 1.4.  When to Conduct a PS-BCA. 1.4.1.  The  PS-BCA  is  a  statutory  requirement  for  all  major  weapon  systems  based  on  10 U.S.  Code.  2337.      Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  63-101/20-101  further  identifies  PS-BCA requirements as mandatory for Acquisition Category (ACAT) I and ACAT II programs and at the discretion of the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for ACAT III programs. 1.4.2.  MDA Discretion. For existing platforms/systems, the MDA also has the discretion to initiate  a  PS-BCA.    All  modification  programs  that  are  classified  as  ACAT  I  or  ACAT  II programs also require a PS-BCA.  PS-BCAs for modifications to ACAT III programs are at the discretion of the Milestone Decision Authority (MDA).  However, once modifications are in  the  sustainment  phase,  consolidate  the  modification  PS-BCA  into  the  system/platform level  PS-BCA.    The  PS-BCA  should  begin  as  early  as  pre-MS  A  or  initial  entry  into  the acquisition life cycle. 1.4.3.  Objectives  and  Approach.  PS-BCA  objectives  and  approach  are  determined  by  the point at which they are accomplished within the program’s life cycle. 1.4.3.1.  Prior to  MS A and MS B.  DoDI 5000.02 states a BCA will be included as an annex  to  the  LCSP.    While  there  are  challenges  to  completing  a  BCA  early  in  the acquisition  life  cycle  due  to  the  lack  of  data  and  system  information  available,  DoDI 5000.02 directs a BCA to be accomplished in support of the MS A decision.  This BCA includes “the assumptions, constraints, and analysis used to develop the product support strategy  documented  in  the  LCSP.”    This  comprises  the  BCA  scope  and  methodology, laying  the  groundwork  for  product  support  management  and  integration,  supply  chain management,  and  maintenance  planning.    Defining  these  areas  early  provides  the framework to assess options for potential future COAs and solidifies the methodology for conducting  the  PS-BCA.    PS-BCAs  prior  to  MS  A  and  B  may  be  limited  in  depth  and detail when compared to a PS-BCA at MS C and later. 1.4.3.2.  Between  MS  B  and  MS  C.    A  PS-BCA  that  fully  examines  the  system’s  PSS should be completed prior to MS C using a best value approach for PSS development that addresses  each  IPS  element.    A  “revalidation”  of  previous  PS-BCAs  is  statutorily 12 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 required  if  five  years  or  more  will  span  between  milestones.    The  revalidation  should confirm the strategy is progressing and update the data and analytical results. 1.4.3.3.  Post  MS  C.    A  PS-BCA  requires  revalidating/updating  prior  to  any  proposed change in the PSS or at a minimum every five years.  Follow the decision tree in section 1.3.1 to determine if a program should accomplish a PS-BCA if a PS-BCA has not been accomplished previously.  The same level of analysis may not be required in all cases for a Post MS C PS-BCA.  If the situation allows, a PS-BCA may only require “revalidation” of the previous analysis, by confirming the strategy is progressing and updating the data and analytical results.  Note: Programs that are post milestone C prior to the enactment of 10 USC Sec 2337, or its predecessor PL 111-84 Sec 805 (October 2010) did not have the legislated requirement to develop a PS-BCA prior to Milestone C.  As a result, they are not required to perform a PS-BCA as part of their to 5 year revalidation.  A PS-BCA is still required when determining a change to the PSS. 1.4.3.4.  The level of detail in a PS-BCA differs according to where the program is in the life cycle, as shown in Figure 1.3.: Figure 1.3.  PS-BCA Schedule Throughout the Life Cycle.  1.4.3.5.  Given the product support COAs may evolve as the life cycle progresses, there is no  standard  set  of  support  COAs  for  a  PS-BCA.    Best  value  product  support  approach may  include  some  mix  of  organic  (e.g.,  government)  and  contractor  support,  as  well  as Public-Private  Partnerships  (PPP).    DoD  Public-Private  Partnering  (PPP)  for  Product Support  Guidebook  provides  greater  fidelity  on  PPP.    The  potential  COAs  should materialize through the execution of the PS-BCA process.  The merits of various sourcing and  partnering  options  should  be  identified  as  system  support  capabilities  are  analyzed across the IPS elements and various support COAs are weighted against desired support requirements and objectives. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 13 1.4.3.6.  The  PS-BCA  decision  tree  in  section  1.4.4.1  is  designed  to  assist  the  PSM  in determining  what  actions  are  required  with  respect  to  either  developing  a  PS-BCA  or revalidating/updating the previously completed PS-BCA. At each step within the process the narrative addresses the requirements and expected objectives.  Revalidating/updating the  PS-BCA  does  not  mean  completely  redoing  the  PS-BCA  every  five  years.    As  the PSM  works  through  each  step,  the  decision  tree  process  assists  in  determining  the requirements  (i.e.,  Memorandum  for  Record  (MFR)  to  document  findings  or  update previous PS-BCA) and outputs. 1.4.4.

Step #2 Decision Tree Process Flow. Step  What Happens ❷ 5-YEAR REVALIDATION or STRATEGY CHANGE?     H   I  F If a PS-BCA was completed previously, determine the reason for updating the PS-BCA.  There are generally two reasons to update a PS-BCA: 1) five years have lapsed since the most recent PS-BCA was accomplished or 2) there is a change in the PSS. If 5-Year Revalidation If a Strategy Change  Continue to “Step 3) Is previous PS-BCA approved & implementation on track??”  Continue to “(H) Perform assessment; outcome change?” Perform assessment; outcome change? Determine how changing the PSS impacts the previous PS-BCA, by determining what changed and then assess how the changes impact costs, benefits, and risks.  Next, assess if the changes would lead to a different recommendation.  This can be done in a variety of ways, one of which is to determine how much the previous results would have to change in order for the recommendation to change.  Then determine if the current changes fall within those bounds.  This is equivalent to performing a sensitivity analysis on the prior PS-BCA. If Yes (Change in outcome) If No (No change in outcome) Continue to “(I) Update Previous PS-BCA” Continue to “(E) MFR to MDA / Document in LCSP” Update Previous PS-BCA  Update the previous PS-BCA using the most current data available.  Since the outcome has changed, this should require reviewing all areas within the PS-BCA (i.e., costs, benefits, and risks).  Incorporate any new information (e.g., extension of the service life since the last PS-BCA) that has come available since the previous PS-BCA was completed and update ground rules and assumptions as appropriate. Continue to activity (F) Develop Recommendation Summarize the findings in a clear and concise manner that explains the recommended solution and why it is recommended.

Step  What Happens ❸ WAS THE RECOMMENDTION IMPLEMENTED?    J  I  F If five years has passed since the latest PS-BCA was completed, an update is required. Updating the PS-BCA does not mean the PS-BCA should be completely redone.  Decide first if the PS-BCA recommendation was implemented or is being implemented.  If Yes (Recommendation was implemented) If No (Recommendation not implemented) Continue to “Step 4) Is the Solution Meeting Program Objectives?” Continue to “(J) Identify & document changes and causes for non-implementation” Identify & document changes and causes for non-implementation Assess and document the reasons why the recommendation was not implemented.  Those reasons could include lack of funding, changes in the political environment, programmatic changes, inability to obtain required technical data, etc.  If the implementation date slipped, update the implementation plan accordingly and document the reason for the slippage.  Once the reason for non-implementation is identified and documented, an assessment should be performed to determine if the recommendation is still valid.  If the recommendation is no longer valid, update the previous PS-BCA in order to determine the appropriate PSS based on current ground rules, assumptions, program environment and current data. Continue to activity (I)  Update Previous PS-BCA  Update the previous PS-BCA using the most current data available.  Since the outcome has changed, this should require reviewing all areas within the PS-BCA (i.e., costs, benefits, and risks).

J  I  F G Assuming the recommendation was implemented, determine if the solution is meeting the objectives as stated in the PS-BCA. If Yes (Solution is meeting objective) If No (Solution is not meeting objective) Continue to “Step 5) Major Change in Program Ground Rules and Assumptions (GR&A) or Program Environment?” Continue to “(J) Identify & document changes and causes for non-performance” Identify & document changes and causes for non-performance Identify and document the reasons why the solution is not meeting the objectives set forth in the PS-BCA.  An example could be that a single work stream is not performing as projected (e.g., maintenance organizations not meeting flow days, supply organizations inability to fill customer requisitions in a timely manner or cost increases have caused budgetary impacts to the program).  Continue to Activity (I) Update Previous PS-BCA  Update the previous PS-BCA using the most current data available.

The Integrated Project Team (IPT) should document any changes to the GR&A and/or program environment.  If new information is available that would drive additional GR&As that were not previously captured, those would be included in the update. Continue to activity (L) Perform assessment; outcome change? Identify if and how those changes/additions in the GR&A and/or program environment affect costs, benefits, and risks.  Determine if the recommendation would change based on the updated information. There are several methods that can be used, however, the method used and results should be documented.

Greater fidelity of the PS-BCA process is described in Attachment 3. Figure 1.10.  PS-BCA Process Map.  26 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  PS-BCA IPT Members. 2.1.1.  Developing a PS-BCA represents a major effort that involves comparing a variety of COAs in order to support major resource decisions in an effort to obtain the best value for the product  support  strategy.    Given  the  scope,  scale,  and  complexity  involved,  participation  is required  from  a  number  of  stakeholders  (to  include  the  warfighter),  support  subject  matter experts  (SMEs),  and  advisors.    The  consolidated  participants  are  led  by  the  PSM  and  are referred to as the PS-BCA IPT.  The IPT should include Major Command (MAJCOM) and Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  representatives.    Additional  information  on  the  roles, responsibilities, and functions of the PS-BCA IPT are located in Section 2.5. 2.2.  Approval Level. 2.2.1.  The approver of the PS-BCA is the MDA.  Depending on the scope and sensitivity of the decision, the MDA can be the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics  (USD(AT&L)),  Head  of  the  DoD  Service  Component,  Service  Acquisition Executive (SAE), or Program Executive Officer (PEO).  Additionally, the MDA can delegate the responsibility to make the PS-BCA final approval as outlined in section 2.3 and maintain compliance with AFI 65-509 and AFMAN 65-510. 2.3.  Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). 2.3.1.  The MDA has overall responsibility for the acquisition program.    The MDA has the authority to approve the entry of an acquisition program into the next phase of the acquisition process  and  is  accountable  to  authorities  such  as  Congress  for  costs,  schedule,  and performance.  The MDA is based on ACAT levels as listed below: 2.3.1.1.  ACAT ID and ACAT IAM:  USD(AT&L) or as delegated. 2.3.1.2.  ACAT  IC  and  ACAT  IAC:    Head  of  the  DoD  Service  Component  or,  if delegated, the SAE (not further delegable). 2.3.1.3.  ACAT II:  SAE or the individual designated by the SAE. 2.3.1.4.  ACAT  III:    Designated  by  the  SAE.    This  category  includes  Automated Information System (AIS) programs that do not meet the criteria for MAIS programs. for  Acquisition,  Technology  and  Logistics 2.3.2.  Under  Secretary  of  Defense (USD(AT&L)).  The  USD(AT&L)  is  responsible  for  supervising  the  Defense  Acquisition System.    The  USD(AT&L)  is  the  principal  staff  assistant  and  advisor  to  the  Secretary  of Defense and the Deputy Secretary of Defense for all matters concerning acquisition. 2.3.3.  United States Air Force Service Acquisition Executive (SAE). The USAF SAE, also known  as  the  Component  Acquisition  Executive  (CAE),  is  responsible  for  all  Air  Force research,  development,  and  acquisition  activities  in  accordance  with  DoDI  5000  series directives.    This  executive  provides  direction,  guidance,  and  supervision  of  all  matters pertaining  to  the  formulation,  review,  approval  and  execution  of  acquisition  plans,  policies and  programs.    The  SAE  can  serve  as  the  MDA  on  ACAT  IC  programs,  if  delegated,  and AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 27 recommends  decisions  on  ACAT  ID  programs.    The  SAE  represents  the  Air  Force  to USD(AT&L) and Congress on all matters relating to acquisition policy and programs. 2.3.4.  Program  Executive  Officer  (PEO).  The  PEO  is  responsible  for  cost,  schedule  and performance in an acquisition program and/or portfolio.  Additionally, the PEO ensures PMs are  coordinating  with  appropriate  stakeholders  and  representatives  to  develop  capabilities based requirements, technical level architectures, integrated test plans, technology transition plans,  product  support  strategies,  and  acquisition  strategies  throughout  the  entire  life  cycle.  The PEO may be responsible for a specific program (e.g., the Joint Strike Fighter), or for an entire  portfolio  of  similar  programs  (e.g.,  the  Air  Force  PEO  for  Space,  who  is  responsible for  all  acquisition  programs  at  the  Air  Force  Space  and  Missile  Systems  Center  as  well  as other  programs  under  Air  Force  Space  Command).    The  PEO  validates  the  PMs’ recommendations and implementation plans.  Validation answers the question, “Is it the right solution  to  the  problem?”    A  PEO  is  typically  delegated  as  the  ACAT  II  and  III  MDA  for programs  in  their  portfolios.    The  PEO  may  delegate  ACAT  III  MDA  authorities  to  any appropriately  qualified  individual(s).  In  addition,  the  PEO,  or  their  delegate,  chairs  the Executive Level Incremental Approval Point (IAP) sessions. 2.4.  Governance Structure. 2.4.1.  For ACAT I (MDAP or MAIS) and selected Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) programs,  the  coordination/approval  structure  depicted  in  Figure  2.1  below  should  be followed  during  the  development,  review,  and  approval  of  the  PS-BCA.    The  PMO  is responsible  for  identifying  a  coordination  approval  structure  for  the  PS-BCA  that  is commensurate with the ACAT level of the program.  The PMO may leverage existing boards or  steering  groups  or  utilize  an  existing  MDA  chain  as  final  review  and  approval  authority for  the  PS-BCA.    Prior  to  the  PS-BCA  kick-off  meeting,  the  PMO  also  identifies organizations  (i.e.,  recommended  stakeholders)  that  should  participate  in  the  IAP  steps  to ensure  enterprise  level  requirements  are  addressed.    In  addition,  IAP  reviews  should  be leveraged to ensure “buy-in” throughout the PS-BCA development process. 2.4.2.  PS-BCA  Engagement.  The  following  section  provides  the  PS-BCA  team  insight  to ensure  a  wide  range  of  diverse  perspectives  prior  to  and  in  support  of  making  major decisions.    The  people  and  organizations  representing  this  diversity  are  the  foundation  for governance,  validation,  and  approval  type  bodies.    Figure  2.1  depicts  the  governance structure for MDAP/MAIS ACAT I and special interest OSD programs.  Figure 2.2 depicts the governance structure for ACAT II & III programs. 2.4.2.1.  DoD Policy: An acquisition program is categorized based on the criteria in DoDI 5000.02.    All  defense  acquisition  programs  are  designated  by  an  ACAT  (i.e.,  I  through III)  and type (e.g., MDAP, MAIS, or Major System).  Once  an ACAT is  established, it remains  throughout  the  lifecycle  of  the  program.    Once  sub-programs  are  incorporated into system level, all expenditures are included into the higher level system. 2.4.2.2.  F  or  ACAT  I  (MDAP  or  MAIS)  and  selected  OSD  programs,  the  governance structures  depicted  in  the  Figure  2.1  should  be  utilized  by  the  PMO  during  the development, validation, and approval of the PS-BCA. 28 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Figure 2.1.  MDAP/MAIS ACAT I and Special Interest OSD Programs.   2.4.2.3.  For  ACAT  II/III  programs,  the  coordination/approval  structure  is  depicted  in Figure  2.2  below  should  be  followed  during  the  development,  review,  and  approval  of the PS-BCA. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 29 Figure 2.2.  ACAT II and III Programs.  2.4.3.  Defense  Acquisition  Board  (DAB).  The  Defense  Acquisition  Board  (DAB)  is  the senior  advisory  board  for  the  DoD  acquisition  system  and  provides  advice  on  critical acquisition  decisions.    The  board  is  chaired  by  the  USD(AT&L)  and  includes  the  Vice Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  the  Service  Secretaries,  and  a  number  of  Under Secretaries  of  Defense.    Members  of  the  DAB  are  responsible  for  approving  MDAPs  and serve as the most important  executive review of expensive acquisition projects  in  the DoD.  The  DAB  is  also  the  principal  review  forum  enabling  USD(AT&L)  to  fulfill  10  USC Chapter 144 responsibilities concerning ACAT I programs. 2.4.3.1.  Best  Practice:    Presenting/coordinating  the  PS-BCA  recommendation  to  the appropriate stakeholders/advisors and within the chain of command is the responsibility of  the  PMO.    While  not  technically  in  the  PM-PEO-MDA  chain  of  command,  it  is recommended  for  all  ACAT  IC/D  and  ACAT  IAC/AM  programs  to  ensure  product support validation within sustainment command centers prior to making recommendation to the SAE. (i.e., Programs within Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) should ensure Air  Force  Sustainment  Center  (AFSC)  /  Air  Force  Life  Cycle  Management  Center (AFLCMC) / Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) commanders are presented 30 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 with the PS-BCA recommendation.)  Coordinate ACAT IC programs with SAF/FMC per AFI 65-509. 2.4.4.  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (Acquisition)  (SAF/AQ).  The  SAF/AQ  has  the authority,  responsibility  and  accountability  for  all  Air  Force  acquisition  programs  and  for enforcement  of  USD(AT&L)  procedures.    The  SAF/AQ  may  choose  to  enact  a  decision based  on  their  inherent  knowledge  of  a  program  for  ACAT  IC,  ACAT  IAC,  and  ACAT  II programs (if not delegated). 2.4.5.  Integrated Life Cycle Management – Executive Forum (ILCM-EF). For ACAT I and special OSD programs, the SAE may utilize the ILCM-EF as a venue for corporate enterprise reviews, decisions, and orchestration of multi-disciplinary agendas that balance and integrate critical  performance  with  short-term  and  long-term  trade-offs.    The  ILCM-EF  provides governance for capability planning, development planning, acquisition, systems engineering, test, and logistics to HAF and Major Commands (MAJCOMs). 2.4.6.  Incremental  Approval  Points  (IAPs).  IAPs  are  vector  checks  designed  to  provide directional  guidance  and  concurrence  throughout  the  process  on  such  matters  as  the  scope, GR&A, evaluation criteria, problem statement, COA selection, data sources, risk mitigation strategies, and  all other  critical  factors contained within the PS-BCA.   IAPs ensure the PS-BCA  strategy  integrates  an  enterprise  wide  perspective.    IAPs  help  identify  and  gain concurrence  on  key  GR&As,  constraints,  and  most  notably  the  weighting  and  scoring methodology.  IAP members are determined by the impact and level of the decisions being made, as well as the PSM’s chain of command. 2.4.7.  IAP Frequency. There is no limit for  the number of IAPs during development of the PS-BCA.  Discretion as to how many IAPs to conduct is left to the PSM.  The PSM needs to ensure  all  aspects  of  the  PS-BCA  are  well  communicated  and  shared  with  appropriate stakeholders,  SMEs,  and  advisors.    The  PSM  should  have  this  governance  body  in  mind when  developing  the  PS-BCA.    These  periodic  meetings,  and/or  coordination  activities, should  ensure  that  no  stakeholder  or  approval  authority  is  surprised  by  the  final  PS-BCA recommendation. 2.4.7.1.  Executive (GO/SES) Level Incremental Approval Point. The Executive General Officer/Senior  Executive  Service  (GO/SES)  level  IAP  includes  multi-functional  senior executives  who  provide  an  enterprise  perspective  to  enhance  decision  making  for  the MDA.  The Executive IAP members provide senior level review balancing requirements, resources, priorities, and mandates.  Executive IAP members also provide guidance to the acquisition execution chain from an integrated and enterprise perspective.  This includes providing insight and ensuring statutory and regulatory compliance and providing support to the PS-BCA team as requested.  The PEO may choose to utilize existing command 1-Star  governance  boards  or  virtually  coordinate  with  the  Executive  IAP  members.  Executive IAP members should include, as applicable: 2.4.7.1.1.  PEO 2.4.7.1.2.  Directorate of Logistics and Product Support (SAF/AQD) 2.4.7.1.3.  Directorate of Information Dominance (SAF/AQI) 2.4.7.1.4.  Directorate of Global Power (SAF/AQP) AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 31 2.4.7.1.5.  Directorate of Global Reach (SAF/AQQ) 2.4.7.1.6.

Others as required by PEO 2.4.7.2.  O-6/GS-15  Level  Incremental Approval Point. The multi-functional  O-6/GS-15 IAP  reviews  the  GR&A,  constraints,  and  weighting/scoring  criteria  and  advises  on  the authoritative  data  sources  used  by  the  PS-BCA  IPT  to  conduct  the  financial  and  non-financial  analysis.    The  criteria  for  the  authoritative  data  source  should  be:  accurate, comprehensive, consistent, timely, available, and accepted.  This approval step may occur numerous  times  in  the  course  of  the  PS-BCA  process  as  data  sources  are  revealed  as determined by the PM.  The O-6/GS-15 IAP members should include, as applicable: 2.4.7.2.1.  PM 2.4.7.2.2.  MAJCOM  A4  A5/8/9  Engineering  (EN),  Contracting  (PK),  Financial Management (FM) (others as required) 2.4.7.2.3.  Center LG (SMC / AFLCMC / AFNWC / AFSC) 2.4.7.2.4.  End-User 2.4.7.2.5.

SAF/FMC (Only ACAT I / All OSD Programs) 2.4.7.3.  Best  Practice:    The  multi-functional  O-6/GS-15  IAP  level  of  review  may  be utilized  multiple  times  as  necessary  to  provide  guidance  and  course  corrections  as necessary  to  successfully  move  forward  to  GO-SES  level  IAP  and  approval  of  the  PS-BCA. 2.5.  PS-BCA IPT Roles, Responsibilities, and Functions. 2.5.1.  The following section provides guidance on assembling a PS-BCA IPT.  The section addresses  involving  the  right  stakeholders,  support  SMEs,  and  advisors  at  the  kickoff meeting  and assembling  the governance structures.  A PS-BCA is  a team effort undertaken by  experienced  participants  across  a  wide  range  of  specialties.    From  the  initial  stages  of accomplishing  the  background  research  and  gathering  the  data,  through  the  final  stages  of staffing  a  PS-BCA  for  senior  decision  makers,  completing  an  effective  PS-BCA  requires significant effort by all those involved. 2.5.2.  PS-BCA IPT Structure. Product support encompasses a range of disciplines including, but  not  limited  to,  logistics,  requirements,  operational  mission  planning,  financial management, contracts, legal, and integrated product support elements.  The structure of the 32 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 PS-BCA  IPT  varies  depending  on  the  maturity  and  the  mission  of  the  program.    The  PSM should  be  cognizant  of  where  the  program  is  in  the  life  cycle,  understand  the  major milestones/events, and provide useful information to the decision makers for the program to move  successfully  forward  through  the  life  cycle.    The  team  should  leverage  the  cross-functional expertise of its members to ensure all support COAs are considered and the best value PSS is selected. 2.5.3.  PS-BCA  IPT  Characteristics.  PSS  are  comprehensive  and  require  early  and  frequent discussion  and  planning  efforts  across  and  between  all  key  stakeholders  and  advisors.    An effective PS-BCA IPT has these characteristics: 2.5.3.1.  All functional disciplines influencing the weapon system throughout its lifetime are represented. 2.5.3.2.  All  the  members  buy  into  the  team's  goals,  plans  of  actions  and  milestones, responsibilities, and authorities. 2.5.3.3.  All staffing, funding, and facilities requirements are identified and resourced. 2.5.4.  PS-BCA  Role  and  Responsibilities.  The  following  sections  describe  roles  and responsibilities of key IPT members that may be involved in the PS-BCA depending on the program’s  life  cycle  phase.    The  PMO  should  maintain  an  IPT  membership  plan  which should  use  all  of  the  information  collected  to  lead  IPT  membership.    The  IPT  membership plan is a key component of executing and completing a successful PS-BCA.  A large portion of IPT management focus is on communication.  The cornerstone of stakeholder and advisor management is understanding who needs what information and when or how often they need it.  The PS-BCA process map (see Figure 1.10.) incorporates relationships between activities and functional units.  This diagram focuses on the logical relationship of the value activities and shows opportunities for open dialogue across multiple levels.  The various stakeholders representing  organizations,  SMEs,  advisors,  approval  authorities,  etc.  should  all  work together  from  the  initial  development  of  the  problem  statement  through  the  final  PS-BCA report incorporating the MDA approval and attaching the PS-BCA to the LCSP. 2.5.4.1.  Program Management Office (PMO). The PMO staff assists the PM and PSM in developing  the  PS-BCA.    Within  the  PMO,  the  PSM  is  responsible  for  planning, developing,  implementing,  and  executing  the  PSS,  informed  by  the  PS-BCA.    Each member of the PMO staff should actively participate in the PS-BCA kickoff meeting and in  developing  the  scope,  GR&As,  and  problem  statement.    PS-BCA  roles  and responsibilities  should  generally  remain  consistent  regardless  of  whether  the  role  is performed  by  a  government  employee  or  a  contractor,  but  ultimately  the  PMO  staff  is responsible for the content and PS-BCA deliverables. 2.5.4.1.1.  The PMO staff should determine what individuals or groups can influence and affect the PS-BCA or be affected by its performance and outcome.  IPT member identification  is  the  process  used  to  identify  all  stakeholders,  SME  support,  and advisors for a PS-BCA.  It is important to understand that not all IPT members have the  same  influence  or  effect  on  a  PS-BCA,  nor  will  they  be  affected  in  the  same manner.  There are many ways to identify IPT members, however, it should be done in  a methodical  and logical  way to  ensure that  IPT members are not  easily omitted.  The  selection  process  may  be  done  by  looking  at  IPT  members  organizationally, AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 33 geographically, or by involvement with various phases or objectives.  Another way of determining  IPT  members  is  to  identify  those  who  are  directly  impacted  by  the  PS-BCA and those who may be indirectly affected.  Examples of directly impacted IPT members are the project team members or the MAJCOM who directed the PS-BCA is being  done  for.    Those  indirectly  affected  may  include  an  adjacent  organization  or members  on  the  local  community.    Directly  affected  IPT  members  should  usually have greater influence and impact of the PS-BCA than those indirectly affected. 2.5.4.1.2.  Support  contractors  (extension  of  the  PMO)  may  participate  in  the  PS-BCA IPT, but they cannot commit the PMO they support to a specific position. The PMO is responsible for ensuring support contractors are employed in ways that do not create the potential for a conflict of interest.  Contractor support staff may participate in PS-BCA IPT discussions, however, they are not permitted to represent the position of  the  supported  organization  and  it  is  recommended  they  be  asked  to  sign  non-disclosure agreements prior to deliberations.  The PMO should consult with the legal advisor to determine whether an organizational conflict of interest exists. 2.5.4.2.  Program Manager (PM). The owner of the PS-BCA is the PM and he/she is the primary  initiator  of  the  actions  and  recommendations  derived  out  of  the  PS-BCA.    The PM also obtains the resources necessary for accomplishing the PS-BCA. 2.5.4.3.  Product  Support  Manager  (PSM).  While  the  PSM  reports  directly  to  the  PM, he/she has statutory responsibility, per 10 U.S. Code § 2337, to lead the PS-BCA.  This includes overseeing the team that is conducting and writing the PS-BCA.  The OSD PSM guidebook and the DoD PS-BCA guidebook can assist the PSM in defining the roles and responsibilities  of  the team  members.    PSMs  are  also  responsible  for  managing  support functions required to field and maintain the readiness and operational capability of major weapon systems, subsystems, and components. Ultimately, the PSM serves as the overall lead for the development of the PS-BCA: 2.5.4.3.1.  Responsible  for  assembling  the  governance  structure,  appropriate  board members, stakeholders, support SMEs and advisors 2.5.4.3.2.  Identify  PS-BCA  IPT  members  (to Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and depot/operations/logistical units) include  Contractors,  Original 2.5.4.3.3.  Key player in the problem statement development and approval 2.5.4.3.4.  Provides insight on support strategy and integration of the IPSEs. 2.5.4.3.5.  Key player on development of COAs and identification of data sources 2.5.4.4.  Data  Manager.  One  of  the  primary  responsibilities  of  the  data  manager  is maintaining and keeping historical records of PS-BCAs.  These records include research, performance outcomes,  cost  estimates and methodology, and sources of data.  Effective configuration  management  of  acquisition  documents  supports  the  decision  making processes  by  allowing  decision  makers  to  have  information  available  throughout  the present  and  future  PS-BCA  process.    The  functions  a  data  manager  performs  can  be accomplished utilizing existing resources.  Some members of the PS-BCA may perform multiple roles and responsibilities. 34 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 2.5.4.5.  Cost  Analyst.    The  cost  analyst  has  the  training  and  skills  to  develop  the financial/cost  analysis  section,  the  analytical  methodology  for  the  PS-BCA,  and comparative analysis of both quantitative and qualitative factors for each COA.  The cost analyst works with the budget  analyst who analyzes historical funding and develops the budget  plan  with  regards  to  the  recommended  PS-BCA  approach.    The  cost  analyst prepares  and  organizes  the  PS-BCA  cost  estimate  in  accordance  with  (IAW)  applicable AFI,  AFMANs,  OSD,  and  Office  of  Management  &  Budget  (OMB)  guidance,  actively participates  in  the  formation  of  the  cost  scope  and  baseline,  and  performs  PS-BCA calculations  to  include  life  cycle  cost  estimates,  benefit  analyses,  risk  assessments, affordability, and sensitivity analyses. The cost analysis is a primary duty of the PS-BCA IPT  and  highlights  the  cost  differences  between  support  or  sustainment  strategies.    PS-BCA cost analysts should follow the cost estimating guidance outlined in the DoD “Cost Assessment  and  Program  Evaluation  (CAPE)  Operating  and  Support  Cost  Estimating Guide 2014.” 2.5.4.6.  Logistician  (Requirements,  Logistics,  and  Supportability  Manager).  The logistician  is  responsible  for  ensuring  the  sustainment  strategy,  requirements,  and performance measures are in the PS-BCA.  The logistician also provides COA specifics and  ensures  sustainment  requirements  are  comprehensively  met.    Additionally,  this person  is  responsible  for  completing  the  mission  impact  section,  including  the  non-financial  analysis  of  the  PS-BCA  as  well  as  collecting  and  calculating  system/program logistics  metrics  such  as  failure  projections,  operating  hours  and  sparing  requirements.  The PMO may have to obtain AFSPC, Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (HQ AFMC) Deployment/ Distribution/Transportation,  Maintenance  support,  and  Life  Cycle  Logistics  (LCL) expertise. Supply  Management, SMEs or AFSC for 2.5.4.7.  Chief  Engineer.  The  Chief  Engineer  and  the  PSM  work  together  to  align  the program’s  strategies  for  systems  engineering  and  product  support  so  they  are  mutually supportive,  avoid  duplication,  and  take  advantage  of  available  synergies.  The  Chief Engineer develops COAs with the PSM and works with the PM and the PSM to select the program’s comprehensive life cycle engineering approach. 2.5.4.8.  Contract  Officers/Managers.  Contracting  officers/managers  are  active  IPT members to ensure contractually viable strategies. 2.5.4.9.  Stakeholders. A stakeholder is a person or group of people who can affect or be affected by the PS-BCA.  Depending on the complexity and scope of the PS-BCA, there may be very few or an extremely large number of stakeholders.  The PS-BCA lead should look at each stakeholder to gather more in depth information in order to understand their impact, involvement, communication requirements, and preferences.  Are they a cohesive team?  Do they support this PS-BCA or are they critical of it?  What is this stakeholder’s interest in this project?  These are the types of questions that should be answered in order to provide a complete analysis. 2.5.4.10.  Warfighter. PS-BCA impacts on the warfighter are the primary considerations.  The warfighter provides the performance requirements for the weapon system which are taken into account for the PSS.  The warfighter also provides feedback on the system and PSS. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 35 2.5.4.11.  AFMC 2.5.4.11.1.  AFMC/A4.  PS-BCA impacts on the enterprise sustainment infrastructure are  the  primary  considerations  of  AFMC  from  a  command  perspective.  AFMC ensures  statutory  compliance  for  core,  50-50,  6%  capital  investments,  and  achieve best value while ensuring support to the warfighter. 2.5.4.11.2.  Air  Force  Sustainment  Center  Logistics  Directorate  (AFSC/LG). Responsible  and  accountable  for  managing  AFSC’s  overall  planning,  resource, process  &  performance  execution  to  achieve  Air  Force  Sustainment  Center Commander  (AFSC/CC)  integrated  vision  for  a  strategy  focused  organization.  AFSC/LG  has  inherent  authority  to  oversee,  integrate,  standardize,  and  direct processes, resources, and organizations to achieve AFSC goals and objectives. 2.5.4.12.  AFSPC 2.5.4.12.1.  AFSPC/A4.  Responsible  for  PS-BCA  impacts  on  the  acquisition  and sustainment  of  space  capabilities,  including  life  cycle  management  planning, sustainment  planning  and  sustainment  management  for  all  assigned  AF  space  and missile systems. 2.5.4.12.2.  Space  and  Missile  Systems  Center,  Space  Logistics  Directorate (SMC/SL).  Responsible  for  acquisition  and  sustainment  of  space  capabilities, including  life  cycle  management  planning,  sustainment  planning  and  sustainment management for all assigned AF space and missile systems.  SMC is the single focal point for life cycle management of space systems logistics and sustainment functions for AF PEO Space delivered systems.  SMC consolidates, coordinates, and provides a single  focal  point  for  logistics/sustainment  activities  including  cross  system integration,  acquisition  logistics,  logistics  readiness,  SE,  and  program  support  of assigned PSMs. 2.5.4.13.  Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). SMEs are recognized experts with specialized knowledge  applicable  to  the  analysis  and  preparation  of  the  PS-BCA  components (logistics,  engineering,  contracting,  budget  analysis,  etc.).    The  PS-BCA  IPT  should leverage SMEs within the PMO, and from functional areas with specific expertise in the focus area or life cycle phase of the program (e.g., software or materials or risk SMEs). This  includes  other  relevant  members  that  provide  inputs  to  and/or  impact  the  PS-BCA analysis.    SMEs  are  typically  found  among  those  who  have  been  in  their  roles  long enough for the knowledge and experience to be “second nature,” or in other words, they know  how  to  do  their  jobs  without  having  to  look  up  information.    In  the  case  of extremely  complex  roles,  they  might  have  to  look  up  information  even  as  a  SME,  but they know exactly where to find that information.  Evidence of sound SMEs include – but is not limited to – the following: 2.5.4.13.1.  Correctly  determines  what  levels  of  performance  are  acceptable  and  can identify and clearly describe performance objectives. 2.5.4.13.2.  Knows  the  order  in  which  successful  performance  steps  are  to  be performed,  and  may  have  made  recommendations  for  improvement  that  have  been adopted. 36 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 2.5.4.13.3.  Has a high degree of familiarity with the technical jargon in his/her area of expertise. 2.5.4.13.4.  For  work  that  is  less  about  performing  tasks  and  more  about  mastering knowledge  required  to  make  effective  decisions  or  to  prioritize  and  assign  work  to teams,  a  SME  is  very  familiar  with  the  requisite  knowledge  that  underlies  effective decision-making. 2.5.4.13.5.  Can produce many cases that illustrate “good” versus “poor” decisions in his/her area of expertise. 2.5.4.13.6.  Knows how to explain his/her area of expertise clearly to others and may serve as a coach, mentor or supervisor within his/her area of expertise. 2.5.4.14.  Product  Support  Providers  (PSPs).  Organic  organizations  (Supply  Chain Management  Groups  (SCMGs),  Maintenance  Groups,  Defense  Logistics  Agency,  etc.) Private Sector (Industry), and Partnership representatives may be invited to PS-BCA IPT meetings to provide information, advice, and recommendations to the IPT, however, the following guidelines should govern their participation: 2.5.4.14.1.  PSPs should not be formal members of the PS-BCA IPT. 2.5.4.14.2.  PSPs  should  not  be  present  during  IPT  deliberations  on  acquisition strategy or competition sensitive matters, nor during any other discussions that would give them a marketing or competitive advantage. 2.5.4.14.3.  At the beginning of each meeting, the IPT lead should introduce each PSP representative, including their affiliation, and their purpose for attending. 2.5.4.14.4.  The  PS-BCA  lead  should  inform  IPT  members  of  the  need  to  restrict discussions  while  PSPs  are  in  the  room,  and/or  the  IAP  chair  should  request  the representatives to leave before matters are discussed that are inappropriate for them to hear. 2.5.4.14.5.  Best  Practice:    Given  the  sensitive  nature  of  PS-BCA  IPT  discussions, PSPs  may  not  be  permitted  to  participate  in  certain  discussions.    The  PSM  may permit PSPs to make presentations to the PS-BCA IPT, when such views will better inform the IPT and do not involve the PSPs directly in government decision making. 2.5.4.15.  Advisors.  The  role  of  an  advisor  is  to  provide  guidance  and  assistance  to  the PS-BCA  IPT.    Advisors  provide  the  IPT  with  an  objective  point  of  view  during  the decision  making  process  with  logical  and  holistic  context  considering  product  support strategies. 2.5.4.16.  SAF/AQD (Required). Provides enterprise oversight of all matters pertaining to product  support,  Supply  Chain  Management  (SCM),  maintenance  of  military  materiel, and  all  support  functions  required  to  field  and  maintain  the  readiness  and  operational capability of weapon systems, including all functions related to weapon system readiness.  Supports  programs  with  oversight,  guidance  and  assistance  relative  to  product  support during  the  development  of  programmatic  documentation  and  the  execution  of  program reviews  throughout  the  life  cycle.    Responsible  for  enterprise  oversight  of  all  matters pertaining  to  Air  Force  depots  throughout  the  life  cycle  and  advises  the  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition) (SAF/AQ). AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 37 2.5.4.17.  SAF/FM  and/or  MAJCOM  FM  (Required).  Provides  expert  cost,  economic, and  financial  decision  support  to  the  Air  Force,  DoD,  and  Congress,  thereby  enhancing Air Force warfighting capabilities and maximizing available resources.  Responsible for cost analysis, budget formulation, distribution of budget and execution oversight for base infrastructure and space weapon systems  sustainment,  funds control and distribution for all appropriations and overall financial resource management, accounting and oversight.  Supports  the  requirements  definition  process,  specifically  in  leading  the  cost  analysis working group for studies for satisfying warfighter requirements and furnishing expertise for independent review, when applicable, of cost estimates produced by other entities. 2.5.4.18.  AFCAA (Required). The Air Force Cost Analysis Agency (AFCAA) provides independent  component  cost  analyses  for  major  space,  aircraft,  and  information  system programs  as  required  by  public  law  and  DoD  policy,  or  those  of  special  interest.    It  is responsible  for  cost  estimating  and  for  enhancing  the  state-of-the-art  methodologies  in cost analysis.  It provides guidance, analytical support, and quantitative cost risk analyses to  11  major  commands  and  the  Air  Force  corporate  staff  on  development  of  cost  per flying-hour  factors  and  resource  requirements.    AFCAA  performs  special  studies supporting  long-range  planning,  force  structure,  analysis  of  COAs,  and  life-cycle  cost analyses.  AFCAA  along with  the  Directorate of Economics and  Business Management (SAF/FMCE) perform the SAF/FMC “approval” function together. 2.5.4.19.  AFLCMC/LG or SMC/SL or AFNWC/LG. Provides product support and life-cycle  logistics  capability  through  functional  management  and  training  of  logisticians SMEs.    Also  provides  hands-on  assistance  planning,  workforce  management  and development  support  for  all  logisticians.

Responsible  for  operational requirements development and oversight of the development, acquisition and fielding of new capabilities.  Assists with command-wide and functional assessments of current and future  plans,  operations,  logistics  and  sustainment  requirements.    Provides  oversight  of modeling and simulation efforts, as well as scientific analyses and assessments. 2.5.4.22.  Legal  Officers/Advisors.  Legal  officers/advisors  should  be  involved  early  and frequently in the PS-BCA process to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, to aid in COA analysis, and in risk identification and analysis 38 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 3 PLANNING FOR THE PRODUCT SUPPORT BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS. 3.1.  PS-BCA IPT Kickoff Meeting. 3.1.1.  The  PS-BCA  IPT  kickoff  meeting  is  a  working  level  meeting  focused  on  providing training  and  guidance.  Organize,  Train,  &  Equip  (OT&E)  organizations  such  as AFLCMC/LG, AFSC/LG, AFNWC, and SMC/SL should provide PS-BCA training and the PMO should provide program description and overview.  The PMO works with stakeholders and  mandatory  advisors  to  ensure  the  right  IPT  members  are  identified  for  the  kickoff meeting  and  provides  input  in  preparation  of  the  kickoff  meeting.    IPT  members  should review  and  finalize  the  charter,  draft  a  problem  statement,  develop  GR&As,  identify  and document  desired  objectives,  discuss  COAs,  set  up  the  structure  of  analysis,  and  review action items and way forward. 3.2.  Preparation for Kickoff Meeting. 3.2.1.  The  PMO  should  identify  appropriate  stakeholders  and  mandatory  advisors  to  begin preparing  for  the  PS-BCA  IPT  Kickoff  Meeting  as  soon  as  practical.  This  PS-BCA framework  includes  developing  an  agenda,  problem  statement,  scope,  desired  outcome(s), schedule, and the initial GR&As which become part of the PS-BCA charter.  The appropriate governance structure should eventually approve the elements of the framework. 3.2.2.  Determine  PMO  PS-BCA  Staffing  Requirements.    The  PMO  determines  if  the  PS-BCA will be executed entirely with organic resources or if contractors will be used to assist in  the  analysis.    If  contractors  are  used,  then  prior  to  the  kickoff  meeting,  the  PMO  should ensure  the  contractors  are  contacted  and  required  Associated  Contractor  Agreements  are  in place.    It  is  recommended  the  agreements  include  pre-priced  extensions,  if  needed,  to complete  the  final  out-brief  and  PS-BCA  report  in  case  there  are  unforeseen  schedule extensions. 3.2.3.  Identify  PS-BCA  IPT  Membership.    The  PMO  determines  which  organizations (defined in Section 2:  Roles and Responsibilities) are required to support the PS-BCA effort.  Prior to the PS-BCA IPT kickoff meeting, the PMO requests Point of Contact (POCs) from each  organization  that  will  be  part  of  the  PS-BCA  IPT  and  provides  any  background  or relevant program information. 3.2.4.  Identify the Governance Structure and Approval Authority.  The PSM should have an established approval structure for the PS-BCA.  The PSM may use existing PM/PEO/MDA chain  or  establish  a  separate  governance  structure  to  approve  a  PS-BCA.    The  PSM  may choose  to  use  existing  boards  to  serve  as  part  of  the  governance  structure.    The  PSM  is responsible to contact the secretariat and coordinate the intent to use the board as part of the PS-BCA governance.  It is important that the PSM leverages the IAP to ensure the PS-BCA is fully coordinated prior to seeking approval from the chosen PS-BCA governance structure. 3.2.5.  Preliminary  Assessment.  Conduct  preliminary  assessment  of  potential  COAs  and required data needed to support the analysis. 3.2.6.  Data  Collection  Plan.  The  data  collection  plan  will  be  discussed  in  more  detail  in Section  9  (Data  Selection,  Collection  and  Assessment  Plan),  however,  the  PMO  should AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 39 conduct  a  review  of  potential  data  sources  (both  organic  and  contractor)  and  identify potential  authoritative  data  sources  (e.g.:    LIMS-EV,  AFTOC,  CEMS,  etc.)  prior  to  the kickoff meeting.  If a gap in data exists, the PMO should determine if it is feasible to mitigate the gap (i.e.:  request data via Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL), establish contractual agreement, or develop potential workaround/alternative data sources).  In the event the data is not available and no workaround exists, this gap identification should be addressed at the kickoff  meeting  and  may  impact  the  development  of  potential  COAs/metric  selection processes. 3.2.7.  Data  Quality.  By  collecting  useful  technical  and  cost  data  early  in  the  life-cycle, decision makers should have the information necessary to make the best assessment possible of the current product support plan with respect to any COA, placing the program leadership in a better position to complete the PS-BCA requirement.  Since the PS-BCA is periodically required  to  be  revalidated,  it  is  in  the  PM’s  best  interest  to  have  the  highest  quality  data available.    As  a  result,  the  team  should  anticipate  and  plan  for  adequate  updates  to  firmly address  the  usual  risks  associated  with  a  PS-BCA,  such  as  a  lack  of  platform  specific historical cost data, or a change in procurement quantity, scope, or service life. 3.2.8.  Situational Awareness. Review prior product support related analyses and determine if any additional analysis should be completed/ updated/reviewed prior to the PS-BCA kickoff meeting (i.e.:  5-year DSOR review, Independent Logistics Assessment (ILA), Depot Activation Prioritization Model assessment, Program Office Estimate (POE), etc.). 3.2.9.  Determine  Realistic  Schedule.  As  noted  previously,  a  PS-BCA  requires  significant effort  to  complete  and  establishing  an  appropriate  and  achievable  schedule  is  critical  to mission success.  Experience has shown that schedules can be influenced by the size of the program,  the  current  life  cycle  phase  of  the  program,  whether  new  documentation  or revalidated  documentation  will  be  used,  access  to  leadership,  review  time  required  by  the leadership, to name but a few. 3.3.  Identify and Establish the PS-BCA IPT. 3.3.1.  The  PS-BCA  IPT  should  consist  of  stakeholders,  support  SMEs,  and  advisors  who have a stake or interest in the outcome of the PS-BCA.  Stakeholders represent organizations or entities that play an active role in the execution of the program throughout the life cycle.  Advisors  represent  organizations  or  entities  that support  either  the  program  or  the  PS-BCA process but do not play an active role in the execution of the program. 3.3.2.  IPT Membership. Table 3.1 provides a list of organizations that can provide program specific PS-BCA IPT members upon request.  Request for team member participation should be sent to the various organizations prior to the kickoff meeting. Table 3.1.  IPT Membership.

Kickoff Meeting. 3.4.1.  Introductions. The PSM conducts roll call and allows stakeholders, support SMEs, and advisors  to  introduce  themselves  by  name,  organization  and  their  role  in  the  PS-BCA process. 3.4.2.  Agenda Review. The PSM provides an overview of the agenda. 3.4.3.  Program  Overview.  The  PSM  provides  a  program  overview  that  includes  a  brief history  of  the  program,  the  phase  within  the  acquisition  life  cycle,  industry/market conditions,  significant  program  events,  and  any  product  support  challenges  or  performance deficiencies  the  program  is  experiencing.    Additionally,  the  overview  includes  relevant information  on  historical  precedents,  previous  BCA  or  PSS  attempts,  acquisition documentation and stakeholders.  The overview should provide enough background to give a general understanding of the program.  This step facilitates defining the baseline, or “as is” COA,  and  provides  context  for  development  of  the  problem  statement.    Background information should include: 3.4.3.1.  Program description. 3.4.3.2.  Mission. 3.4.3.3.  Acquisition phase. 3.4.3.4.  Reason for PS-BCA (Milestone phase in the acquisition life cycle, New weapon system or platform, Proposed change in PSS, Five-year revalidation). 3.4.4.  Significant changes. Any significant changes to the following since previous analyses were accomplished (revalidation): 3.4.4.1.  Operating environment. 42 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 3.4.4.2.  Operating tempo. 3.4.4.3.  Modifications to contracting language. 3.4.4.4.  Basing. 3.4.4.5.  Budgetary environment. 3.4.5.  Review Charter. The PS-BCA IPT reviews and updates the charter to summarize the PS-BCA  IPT’s  direction  and  approval  process.    Elements  of  the  charter  include  authority, purpose,  problem  statement,  scope,  desired  outcome(s),  baseline  determination,  governance structure, and schedule. 3.4.6.  Baseline Determination. Describe the “as is” state in sufficient detail to establish cost, and  for  new  systems  identify  analogous  systems  for  comparative  cost  analysis.  Refer  to Section 4 (COAs) for additional information. 3.4.7.  Framework Development. 3.4.7.1.  Problem Statement. The PS-BCA problem statement should provide an accurate and concise reason for conducting the PS-BCA, as well as define the analysis framework for  the  current  deficiencies,  additional  requirements,  or  opportunities  for  improvement.    The  PS-BCA  should  also  focus  on  identifying  the  best  value  PSS  by  balancing requirements  (i.e.:    Operational  Availability  (Ao))  and  affordability  to  meet  the warfighters’  requirements.    The  PSS  for  a  specific  program  or  component  should  be tailored to the operational  and support requirements  of the system.  However, readiness and  availability  should  be  balanced  with  affordability,  taking  budget  realities  into account.   There is  no  “one size fits  all” approach to  PSS development.   During the PS-BCA  IPT  problem  statement  development,  the  IPT  needs  to  consider  the  following  key questions: 3.4.7.1.1.  What is the desired end state? 3.4.7.1.2.  What is the purpose of the analysis? 3.4.7.1.3.  What is required to meet statute? 3.4.7.1.4.  Is  there  an  existing  PSS  in  place?  If  so,  are  requirements/expectations being met? 3.4.7.1.5.  Are their deficiencies, additional requirements, or opportunities to improve system support? 3.4.7.1.6.  What decision(s) is/are the analysis intended to support? 3.4.7.1.7.  Has appropriate product support analysis been completed (such as Level of Repair Analysis, Depot Source of Repair, and Supportability Analysis) 3.4.7.1.8.  Caution/Pit  Fall:    PS-BCA  problem  statements  should  not  assume  a specific means of achieving the desired result.  Rather, problem statements contain an objective description of the desired end-state or outcome (i.e., not biased toward any one  COA).    Biases  or  unfounded  assumptions  in  problem  statements  undermine  the analytical purpose of the PS-BCA by jumping to conclusions. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 43 3.4.7.2.  Scope.  A  well-defined  problem  statement  aids  in  establishing  the  scope  of  the PS-BCA.  The scope will then aid the IPT in setting and maintaining the boundaries for the  analysis.    Scope  includes  what  product  support  capability  and  timeframes  will  be analyzed.  The scope should also state what aspects of the program are not included in the analysis  and  why  (i.e.:    covered  under  separate  analysis,  not  a  differentiator  across  the COAs, outside the area of responsibility of the PMO, etc). 3.4.7.2.1.  In order to determine the scope of the analysis, the PS-BCA IPT needs to clearly define these areas: 3.4.7.2.1.1.  Will  the  analysis  be  conducted  for  the  entire  system  or  only  on certain sub-systems? 3.4.7.2.1.2.  Will the analysis include both common and peculiar components? 3.4.7.2.1.3.  Will  the  analysis  include  associated  equipment  not  managed  by  the PMO  conducting  the  analysis  (i.e.:   training  systems,  weapons,  system engineering/automated test systems (ATS), etc.)? 3.4.7.2.1.4.  Will  all  12  IPS  elements  be  analyzed?    If  one  or  more  of  the  IPS elements  are  not  applicable  to  the  PS-BCA,  a  rationale  should  be  provided  that describes the exclusion. 3.4.7.2.1.5.  What organizations are impacted/involved in the analysis? 3.4.7.2.1.6.  What  geographical  areas,  sites,  and  locations  are  impacted/involved in the analysis? 3.4.7.2.1.7.  Is this a peacetime or wartime operating environment? 3.4.7.2.1.8.  Are there other  categories that might have a potential impact on the decision? 3.4.7.2.2.  For  all  of  the  areas  evaluated  in  determining  the  scope,  the  PS-BCA  IPT should  clearly  explain  and  document  why  an  area  of  the  program  was  included  or excluded and the rationale needs to link back to the PS-BCA problem statement.  It is recommended to review all 12 IPS elements during Post MS C PS-BCA even though it may be determined on previous PS-BCAs that some elements had no impact. 3.4.7.2.3.  Table  3.2  shows  a  second  recommended  categorization  of  the  12  IPS elements combined into higher level/overarching categories.  The asterisks (*) within Table  3.2  annotates  cross-cutting  elements  and  should  be  considered  across  all categories.  This  second  categorization is  very similar to  the breakout  of  the 12  IPS elements previously discussed in Section 1 (Overview) of the pamphlet. Table 3.2.  Integrated Product Support (IPS) Element Categorization. Product Support Management  Maintenance Supply Chain Management Sustaining Engineering Technical Data Computer Resources (except for S/W Computer Resources (S/W Maintenance Only)  Supply Support PHS&T Design Interface Sustaining Engineering 44 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Maintenance Planning and Management Maintenance) Facilities and Infrastructure* Support Equipment* Training and Training Systems* Manpower and Personnel* Product Support Management 3.4.7.3.  Desired  Objectives  and  Requirements.  The  desired  objectives  for  requirements identified  by  the  PS-BCA  IPT  should  be  coordinated  at  the  O-6/GS-15  IAP.    The  PS-BCA IPT needs to come to consensus on the desired objectives and periodically review them to  remain on track.   IAP  members should also  concur with  the desired objectives.  Some possible sources of program requirements may be the Key Performance Parameters (KPP),  Key  System  Attributes  (KSA),  performance  metrics  already  identified  by  the Capability  Development  Document  (CDD),  and  Capabilities  Production  Document (CPD). 3.4.7.3.1.  The desired objectives and documented requirements may take the form of a Product Support Arrangement (PSA).  A PSA is an implementing agreement, such as  a  contract,  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU),  Memorandum  of  Agreement (MOA),  Commercial  Service  Agreement  (CSA),  Service  Level  Agreement  (SLA), and similar formal agreements to ensure performance expectations (on both sides) are clearly articulated. 3.4.7.3.2.  Desired Objectives Examples. 3.4.7.3.2.1.  MAJCOM perspective: Increase in Aircraft Availability (AA) to meet mission requirements without increasing fleet size. 3.4.7.3.2.2.  A reduction of Mission Impaired Capability Awaiting Parts (MICAP) across the platform that supports an increase in AA to meet mission requirements without increase in cost or logistics footprint. 3.4.7.3.2.3.  Reduction in Operation & Support (O&S) costs. 3.4.7.3.3.  Best  Practice.    It’s  difficult  to  create  a  good  problem  statement  without thinking through the scope and desired objectives.  The problem statement creation is iterative.  A good problem statement provides a clear description of the issue areas to be  evaluated  and  how  success  will  be  evaluated.  The  problem  statement  should  be approved by the appropriate governance structure at/or around the time of the kickoff meeting, i.e. PEO and/or PM.  Leadership concurrence early in the PS-BCA process can mitigate unnecessary rework and ensure the analysis covers the assigned subjects.  Make  sure  problem  statement  scope  and  objectives  are  properly  aligned.  Clearly identify if multiple ACAT program(s) are associated with the analysis and include in GR&A (i.e.: If the PS-BCA is planned to include a weapon system and any associated modernization  efforts,  need  to  state  what  modernization  efforts  are  included  in  the baseline.)    Ensure  that  desired  objectives  can  be  properly  addressed  in  the  analysis.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 45 For  example,  if  one  of  the  desired  objectives  is  an  increase  in  AA,  ensure  that methodologies and relevant data will be available to provide this information. 3.4.7.4.  Ground  Rules  &  Assumptions  (GR&As).  This  section  provides  guidance  on documenting GR&As and methodology used for a PS-BCA.  GR&As and methodologies should be examined early in the PS-BCA process and the draft GR&As and methodology should  be  developed  prior  to  the  kickoff  meeting.    Putting  the  GR&As  in  the  charter helps frame the analysis and supports the rules of engagement for the PS-BCA IPT.  The initial GR&As may be modified as the analysis progresses.  Any change to GR&As after the  charter  is  signed  should  be  vetted  and  agreed  to  by  the  IAP  members  prior  to implementation. 3.4.7.4.1.  Ground  Rules.  The  ground  rules  document  known  or  dictated  parameters and conditions for the PS-BCA.  Prior to formulating assumptions, what is known for certainty  should  be  stated  under  the  ground  rules:  facts,  laws,  defined  criteria, constraints, regulations, OSD and/or Service guidance.  Included in the ground rules are  any  factors  known  to  be  true  that  may  affect  the  current  or  future  business conditions.  Constraints  are  those  factors  known  or  discovered  that  are  beyond  the control of the PM or PSM and bound the PS-BCA analysis.  The PS-BCA IPT needs to understand these constraints before beginning the analysis.  Constraints should be presented to the governance board and decision maker of the PS-BCA. An example of a  constraint  could  be  funding  constraints  originated  by  a  congressional  mandate.  Programs should have an initial DSOR at MS A, and an updated DSOR at MS B.  For programs  at  or  past  MS  C,  they  should  have  completed  their  DSOR  and  preceding Core determination.  These DSOR and Core determinations should not be superseded by  the  PS-BCA.    The  ground  rules  should  be  compliant  with  all  applicable  laws including but not limited to 10 USC 2460, 2464, 2466 and 2474. 3.4.7.4.1.1.

MAJCOM Ao threshold is ##% and Objective is ##%. 3.4.7.4.1.2.1.5.  Other  DoD  agencies  (i.e.  Navy,  Army,  Defense  Logistics 46 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Agency  (DLA),  etc.)  will  manage/repair  common  (stock  listed)  spare  parts and/or support equipment that applies to the (name of program) system. 3.4.7.4.1.2.1.6.  The  (program  name)  will  be  maintained  using  what maintenance  concept  –  organizational  level  (O-level)  and  depot  level  (D-level); however, there will be some O-level back shop work to be defined. 3.4.7.4.1.2.2.  Financial. 3.4.7.4.1.2.2.1.  All  costs  will  be  presented  in  Base  Year  20XX  (BYXX) dollars and Then-Year (TY) dollars. 3.4.7.4.1.2.2.2.  All  comparative  cost  dollars  will  be  presented  in  NPV  or Present Value (PV) Costs, as appropriate. 3.4.7.4.1.2.2.3.  The  O&S  Element  Structure  used  in  the  cost  analysis  will be  based  on  the  guidance  provided  in  the  Operating  and  Support  Cost Estimating Guide dated March 2014 and prepared by the OSD CAPE. 3.4.7.4.1.2.3.

An assumption is an informed position about what is true of a current or future state of affairs for a situation where explicit factual knowledge is unobtainable  (i.e.,  inflation  rates).    Assumptions  define  aspects  that  are  beyond  the control  of  the  PS-BCA  team.    They  are  explicit  statements  about  the  conditions  on which  the  PS-BCA  IPT  bases  the  analysis.  After  stating  factors  in  the  ground  rules section,  list  assumptions  and  document  why  those  assumptions  were  selected.    If  a stakeholder  or  advisor  non-concurs  with  any  selected  assumption,  document  the rationale  for  the  non-concurrence.    Assumptions  are  also  vital  for  the  risk  and sensitivity  analysis.  It’s  important  to  note  that  GR&As  may  be  changed  throughout the analysis process.  GR&As do not need to be 100% complete for charter inclusion.  GR&As in the charter should be used to help frame the analysis and support rules of engagement for the IPT.  However, any changes to GR&As after the charter is signed should be vetted and agreed to by the IPT prior to implementation. 3.4.7.4.2.1.  In the sensitivity analysis section, evaluate each major assumption to determine  its  impact  on  the  PS-BCA  recommendation.    Omitting,  changing,  or misusing of assumptions can directly influence which COA is recommended.  A non-exhaustive list of major PS-BCA assumptions includes: AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 47 3.4.7.4.2.1.1.  Financial metrics and inputs (inflation). 3.4.7.4.2.1.2.

Programs that required a standalone study 3.4.7.4.3.5.  Inclusions  identify  areas  specifically  considered  as  applicable  to  the study. 3.4.7.4.4.  Examples of areas that could be included in the analysis are as follows: 3.4.7.4.4.1.  Non-recurring start-up costs 3.4.7.4.4.2.  Material cost 3.4.7.4.4.3.  Depot  Maintenance  Cost  (incremental  rate  and  full  cost  to  recover rate) 3.4.7.4.4.4.  Support equipment 3.4.7.4.4.5.  Training/simulators 3.4.8.  Update  Charter.  The  PS-BCA  IPT  updates  the  charter  to  summarize  the  PS-BCA IPT’s activities per the IPT kickoff meeting. 48 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 4 COURSES OF ACTION 4.1.  Introduction. 4.1.1.  COAs, also known as alternatives, are various options to achieve the desired objective.  Selection  of  the  proper  product  support  COA  is  essential  to  the  success  of  the  PS-BCA.  There is no set maximum number, however, a minimum of two COAs is required for  a PS-BCA.  The decision maker, however, should have a representative range of COAs to make a well informed decision.  If too many COAs are evaluated for example, the costs and time to perform the PS-BCA analysis will increase and the quality of the analysis for each COA will likely be negatively impacted.  Therefore, the team should carefully consider the breadth and variety of COAs to be selected for analysis. 4.1.2.  COA Development. COAs can be intuitively obvious or they may take a determined effort to define. Creativity is key to developing effective COAs and many times groups are more  creative  than  individuals.    Those  developing  COAs  should  have  knowledge  of  the program in question and an understanding, or at least a solid foundation, of the different IPS elements. 4.1.3.  COA  Detail.  COAs  need  to  be  described  in  sufficient  detail  to  facilitate  proper analysis  (cost,  benefit  and  risk).  COAs  should  also  be  defined  so  that  appropriate  IPS  and costs  elements  can  be  identified  and  evaluated  in  terms  of  the  scope  of  work  and  who  will perform  the  work.    Even  those  unfamiliar  with  the  COAs  should  be  able  to  read  the descriptions and fully understand the concepts and what is required to implement the COAs.  Additionally, each COA needs to be clearly distinguishable from other COAs. 4.2.  Status Quo  COA.  4.2.1.  The  PS-BCA  should  include  a  COA  which  is  the  status  quo  as  documented  in  the LCSP.    This  is  the  “change  nothing”  or  “as-is”  COA  that  describes  how  the  function  or process  under  study  currently  exists.    The  PS-BCA  is  about  action,  inaction  and consequences.    Changing  nothing  for  now  is  not  necessarily  "neutral"  -  there  can  be  both negative and positive consequences - and a full consideration of all factors should strengthen any subsequent findings.  For assessments completed prior to MS C, the PMO should utilize the PSS approved at the previous MS as the “as-is” COA. 4.2.2.  COA  Baseline.  The  status  quo  or  “as-is”  COA  should  serve  as  a  baseline  against which all other COAs are compared.  This COA also takes into account the future plan of the organization,  such  as  planned  and  scheduled  changes  and/or  enhancements  to  the  existing program, and should reflect a review of the mission and strategic goals. 4.3.  Future State COAs. 4.3.1.  Future  state  COAs,  also  known  as  the  “to-be”  COAs,  establish  other  options  that should  be  evaluated.    As  stated  previously,  these  COAs  need  to  be  clearly  distinguishable from each other and also provide sufficient variety to give decision makers options to choose from. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 49 4.3.2.  COA Formulation. Future state COAs are formulated by the PS-BCA  IPT.  The  IPT utilizes  brainstorming  techniques  or  structured  techniques  such  as  the  Decision  Support Matrix for Product Support, as described in the DoD Product Support PS-BCA Guidebook, to assist them throughout the process. 4.3.3.  Holistic  Approach.  There  are  two  primary  methods  to  structure  COAs,  holistic  and modular.  The holistic approach views the work streams, or IPS elements, as interrelated and are  not  analyzed  independent  of  each  other.    This  is  essentially  an  “all  or  nothing” perspective to  developing COAs.  When using a holistic approach costs, benefits,  and risks are assessed across all IPS elements at the same time.  If a PS-BCA is being performed after MS  C,  a  holistic  approach  is  generally  used  due  to  overlapping  work  streams.    Table  4.1 shows how this approach would be represented for the individual IPS elements. Table 4.1.  Holistic Approach. 4.3.4.  Modular  Approach.  The  modular  approach,  views  the  work  streams  or  IPS  elements as standalone elements  which can be combined to  form  a COA.  An example of a modular approach,  shown  in  the  Table  4.2,  assesses  costs,  benefits,  and  risks  associated  with  each work  stream  and  then  combining  those  work  streams  in  a  variety  of  combinations  to determine the best overall COA.  The IPT should examine each of the IPS elements to ensure the  proprietary  nature  of  data  and  intellectual  property  does  not  inhibit  potential combinations.    If  a  PS-BCA  is  being  performed  prior  to  MS  C,  a  modular  approach  is generally  used  due  to  the  analogous  data  that  is  used  and  this  should  provide  flexibility  to decision makers by allowing them to customize a COA for their decisions.  Table 4.2.  Modular Approach.  50 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 4.3.5.  Comprehensive View. The best solution is not necessarily the most obvious solution, and  some  innovative  thought  is  often  required  to  develop  other  possible  solutions  to  a problem.    In  defining  COAs,  the  IPT  should  take  a  comprehensive  view  and  include considerations related to each COA. 4.3.6.  COA  Limitations.  To  begin  defining  COAs,  the  IPT  should  establish  the  limits  of viable  COAs  (bookends)  in  order  to  establish  boundaries  for  a  diverse  set  of  COAs  to analyze.    While  COAs  can  be  defined  in  terms  of  capabilities  and  performance,  they  are usually  defined  in  terms  of  the  source  of  product  support  (i.e.,  organic  or  contractor).    All organic  or  all  contractor  supported  systems  are  rare  and  are  generally  limited  to  mission driven operational environment factors (all organic) or commercial or commercial-derivative systems (all contractor).  Even though all organic or contractor source of product support are often not  viable, the rationale for  their  exclusion from  evaluation  should  be included in  the PS-BCA.  The alternative analysis focuses on achieving the appropriate mix of organic and contractor  capabilities  through  finding  the  best  value  solution  for  each  of  the  IPS  elements required for sustainment. 4.3.7.  COA  Evaluation.  When  defining  future  state  COAs,  the  IPT  needs  to  explain  how each “to-be” COA operates, how it provides value to the organization, and how it compares to  the  current  “as-is”  COA.    Other  questions  the  IPT  needs  to  consider  include:  How  do future state COAs address shortfalls in the current state?  How does one future COA relate to other  “to-be”  COAs  being  examined?    For  each  COA  considered,  the  IPT  describes  the future state of operations that the proposed decision should  help  achieve.  Additionally, the PS-BCA  should  contain  the  rationale  decisions  on  how  COAs  were  developed  and  how COAs were eliminated as part of a down-select process. 4.3.8.  Additional  Factors.  Other  factors  to  consider  when  identifying  and  defining  future state COAs include the following. 4.3.8.1.  Identify  feasibility  of  product  support  providers  across  the  different  IPS elements. 4.3.8.2.  Consider various feasible combinations of workload percentages, such as 50–50, 25–75, 75–25. 4.3.8.3.  Consider the possibility of developing competitive contractor COAs using both the OEM and Third Party Logistics (3PL) options. 4.3.8.4.  Consider  various  contract  types  and  specify  the  degree  to  which  it  impacts  the analysis. 4.3.8.5.  Develop  Performance  Based  Logistics  (PBL)  solutions  that  optimize  total system availability while minimizing cost in accordance with DoD Directive 5000.01.  If the  acquisition  environment  permits,  potential  contractors  should  be  included  in alternative definitions to perform tradeoffs. 4.3.8.6.  When  applicable,  use  PPP  to  leverage  the  capabilities  of  both  organic  and contractor sectors.  See DoD PPP for Sustainment Guidebook for further information on each type of PPP. Tailor partnerships to IPS elements at the component, sub-assembly, or system/platform level. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 51 4.3.8.7.  Address  items  that  have  been  identified  as  a  requirement  to  establish  repair capability, including considerations of facilities, personnel and data rights. 4.3.8.8.  Ensure COAs are in compliance with Title 10 U.S. Code § 2464 - Core logistics capabilities, DSOR, and Title 10 U.S. Code § 2466 - Limitations on the performance of depot-level maintenance of materiel. Explanation needs to be included if a COA is not in compliance. 4.3.8.9.  For  systems  in  sustainment,  consider  focusing  COA  development  on  specific IPS  elements  where  there  are  performance  gaps  or  opportunities  for  improvements.  Additionally,  keep  in  mind  that  previous  decisions  or  specific  leadership  direction  may influence COA development for systems in the sustainment phase. 4.4.  Validation and Feasibility. 4.4.1.  By definition, the option selected to meet the desired objective should be one of, or a combination of, the COAs considered.  Therefore, it’s essential that in the decision-making process a range of reasonable COAs are examined.  For a COA to be reasonable, it should be consistent  with  all  legal  requirements  and  Air  Force  regulations.    Adequacy  and  economic feasibility are other key elements in the identification of reasonable COAs.  Adequacy refers to  the  capacity  of  the  potential  COA  to  meet  the  desired  objective.    Economic  feasibility refers to the potential COA being consistent with funding realities. 4.4.2.  Iterative  Process.  COA  analysis  is  an  iterative  process.    The  first  step  is  an examination of the range of potential COAs to  determine which are  reasonable and  require further evaluation.  This information should be summarized in the PS-BCA.  An alternative that  meets  the  desired  objective,  including  the  status  quo,  is  reasonable  if  it  cannot  be eliminated on non-economic grounds.   It is possible that only one COA will be reasonable, however,  generally there are two or three reasonable COAs that warrant  further evaluation.  Normally,  no  more  than  four  or  five  COAs  are  considered  in  detail,  although  there  are exceptions. 4.4.3.  COA  Elimination.  A  COA  can  be  eliminated  from  further  analysis  whenever  it appears to no longer achieve the desired objective; it should be coordinated with the O-6/GS-15 IAP to gain concurrence with its removal.  COA elimination requires approval at the O-6/GS-15 level of the governance body.  The PS-BCA itself should be pursued only as long as it is useful to the decision-making process.  It can be completed and the findings documented at  any  stage.    For  example,  a  number  of  COAs  were  considered  but  as  the  analysis progressed, only two emerged as feasible. The preliminary calculation of life-cycle costs and benefits demonstrated that one of the two COAs was clearly superior to, and less costly, than the  other.  At  that  point,  there  was  no  benefit  to  be  gained  from  completing  any  further analysis. The findings should simply be documented in a short report or memorandum. 4.4.4.  COA  documentation.  If  a  COA  was  considered  but  dismissed  as  unreasonable, document  the  rationale  for  dismissal  in  the  PS-BCA  final  report.    Note,  cost  alone  is  not  a valid rationale for a COA being dismissed.  If cost is the reason for not selecting a COA, the cost  analysis  should  be  shown  (COA  should  be  developed,  costed,  and  proven  to  be prohibitive, not merely dismissed from the onset as being infeasible due to cost). 4.4.5.  Additional  Consideration.  Areas  to  consider  when  validating  and  determining feasibility include, but are not limited to, the following: 52 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 4.4.5.1.  Are all feasible COAs considered? 4.4.5.2.  Are  a  reasonable  number  of  COAs  considered  to  include  the  limits  (bookends) COAs  and  hybrid  COAs  containing  diverse  combinations  of  providers  for  the  various integrated product support elements? 4.4.5.3.  Are COAs significantly different? 4.4.5.4.  Is  adequate  supporting  documentation  provided  for  all  COAs  that  were  down selected before full analysis was completed? 4.4.5.5.  Are the COAs in accordance with legislative guidance? 4.4.5.6.  Were  other  government  agencies'  capabilities  to  provide  a  product  or  service considered? 4.4.5.7.  Are  the  COAs  defined  in  such  a  manner  that  the  applicable  benefits,  cost elements and possible risks can be clearly identified and assigned? 4.4.5.8.  Do  the  COAs  clearly  identify  who  will  provide  support  in  each  case?    For example, will support be provided organically or commercially? 4.4.5.9.  Do the COAs identify where the work will be done?  For example, will depot or material support be provided locally or will transportation to other locations be required? Depending on the answer, this might involve additional cost and possibly an increase in time. 4.4.5.10.  Are  obvious  COAs  included  or  addressed  in  some  manner?  For  example,  an obvious  issue  to  address  in  the  COAs  is  whether  maintenance  and  other  sustainment activities should be performed by the government or by a contractor. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 53 Chapter 5 BENEFITS AND NON-FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 5.1.  Benefits Introduction. 5.1.1.  Benefits  are  non-monetary  factors  that  are  a  critical  part  of  COA  evaluation  in comparative analyses.  Benefits differ from cost in that, costs are inputs (monetary resources) required to implement each COA, whereas, benefits are the outputs to be gained as a result of the resource inputs.  In developing the list of costs and benefits, care should be taken to avoid double-counting  (i.e.,  benefits  should  be  mutually  exclusive).    Benefits  are  evaluated  using the  metrics  that  measure  success  in  the  “as  is”  state  of  the  current  product  support arrangement.  These metrics should be applicable to all the COAs.  They can be qualitative or quantitative in nature (subjective or objective). 5.2.  Selecting Benefits. 5.2.1.  To  determine  which  benefits  to  include,  stakeholders  should  assess  the  factors  most important in achieving the desired outcome and for evaluating the problem statement.  These should  be  tied  to  the  product  support  requirements  such  as  SCM,  SE,  maintenance,  etc.  Benefits  may  be  qualitative  in  nature,  which  injects  a  degree  of  subjectivity  into  the assessment.    While  this  subjectivity  cannot  be  avoided,  it  is  important  that  the  scoring  and results  are  traceable  and  repeatable.    Any  and  all  categories  of  benefits  analyzed  should  be fully explained so someone unfamiliar with benefits can fully understand the benefit and its measurement.  (Note: If a benefit can be measured in monetary terms, it should be included in the cost section of the analysis.) 5.2.2.  Stakeholder  Input.  One  approach  to  select  the  benefits  to  be  assessed  is  to  receive input  from  stakeholders,  support  SMEs,  and  advisors  that  are  listed  in  Section  3  (PS-BCA IPT Membership).  As discussed above, a key advisor on the team should be a cost analyst who should advise the team on methodology and process, but should not participate directly in the weighting and scoring of benefits.  The first step in the benefit analysis process is for the  team  to  develop  a  list  of  benefits  expected  to  accrue  as  a  result  of  implementing  the COAs under consideration. 5.2.3.  Benefit  Realization.  Benefits  should  be  developed  within  the  context  of  the  problem statement  and  the  scope  of  the  analysis.    The  benefits  developed  should  be  benefits  to  the government,  not  simply  the  program  under  study,  attained  over  the  period  of  analysis.  Realized  benefits  are  excluded  from  consideration  and  this  should  be  documented  in  the GR&As.    There  are  two  broad  categories  of  non-monetary  benefits:  non-monetary quantitative benefits and non-monetary qualitative benefits. 5.2.4.  Category  Metric  Attributes.  The  linkage  from  the  category  down  to  the  metric  and attribute, along with the rationale and data source, should be completely documented by the PS-BCA  Team  (see  Table  5.1).  Appendix  F  in  the  OSD  PBL  guidebook,  dated  2016,  is  a good source for metrics across the product support elements. 54 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Table 5.1.  Category Metric Attribute. 5.3.  Quantitative Benefits and Metrics.  5.3.1.  Non-monetary  Factors.  These  factors  are  non-monetary,  but  quantifiable  in  terms other  than  dollars.    Examples  of  non-monetary,  quantifiable  benefits  include  AA,  parts supportability,  system  sustainability,  etc.    Benefits  are  the  overall  criteria  selected  of “measures of goodness” of the COAs under consideration.  PS-BCA IPTs should take care to fully use quantitative benefits, if data permits, rather than a subjective benefit that is intended to measure the same factor. 5.3.2.  Metric Evaluation. Metrics are the data elements used in the evaluation of the benefits categories.  For example, a benefit selected by the team under the Supply Support Category may  be  Issue  Effectiveness.    Existing  metrics  of  the  program  under  study,  or  an  analogous program for new programs with no history, provides a starting point for determining the most important outputs of a particular project or program.  There is no precise “right number” of benefits or supporting metrics.  However, benefits should be limited to those most important in  meeting the  requirements established in  the problem  statement.  Evaluating an excessive number  of  benefits  tends  to  dilute  the  impact  of  any  one  benefit  and  may  result  in inconclusive results. 5.3.3.  COA Comparison. All feasible COAs considered  in the analysis should be evaluated against the same set of benefits categories and metrics.  If a particular COA does not provide a stated benefit, it should be scored zero in the weighting and scoring process (Section 8.0, Weighting and Scoring). 5.3.4.  Wash  COAs.  Benefits  not  expected  to  differ  across  COAs  are  wash  benefits,  just  as costs that are the same across COAs are wash costs, and can be excluded from the benefits analysis.  Excluded benefits should be discussed in the GR&As, so that it doesn’t appear that the omission was accidental. 5.3.5.  Metrics supporting PSS.  Metrics are the means by which the PSM and PS-BCA team gain  understanding  of  the  PSS  and  identify  potential  gaps  between  required  and  actual performance.  There is  no perfect  metric,  but  selecting  an appropriate set of metrics should promote the desired behavior and outcome for executable COAs.  Benefits criteria should be coordinated with the O-6/GS-15 IAP. 5.3.6.  Value-Add  Metrics.  Metrics  should  be  selected  or  constructed  to  encourage performance  improvement,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and  innovation.    These  metrics  should be applicable to “as is” state and should be the starting point for the PS-BCA.  The metrics should  effectively  align  with  the  warfighters’  mission,  contribute  to  meeting  requirements, ensure  on-time  delivery  of  a  quality  product,  and  reduce  costs.    It  is  important  to  exercise caution  when  selecting  a  combination  of  metrics  to  ensure  that  they  are  not  redundant, AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 55 confounding,  or  counteractive.    Multiple  metrics  can  reinforce  desired  behavior  or  create undesirable conflicts. 5.3.7.  Metric  Documentation.  The  PS-BCA  Team  should  document  the  reasoning/rationale for using the specific metrics.  The stakeholders and advisors should understand and agree to this rationale. Below are examples of some quantitative benefits and associated metrics: Table 5.2.  Quantitative Benefits and Associated Metrics.

Qualitative Benefits and Metrics. 5.4.1.  Qualitative  benefits  are  intangible  benefits  that  are  not  easily  quantified,  but  are nonetheless  important.    This  might  include  factors  such  as  capability  enhancements, environmental  benefits  (use  of  renewable  energy  resources,  lower  or  less  toxic  emissions, etc.), morale/quality of life, and safety.  Strategic organizational benefits may be difficult to quantify  or  may  be  unquantifiable/intangible  in  some  situations,  but  are  often  very  critical when developing a business case.  These benefits may be very important to the organization because  of  law,  policy,  or  strategic  objectives  that  direct  the  result  or  because  of  other organizational  goals.    A  well  done  qualitative  benefit  analysis  is  as  valid  as  a  quantitative analysis.  Definition and explanation of benefits are important to give the analysis credibility and  to  help  readers  understand  their  importance.    Thorough  definition  and  explanation  of weighting  and  scoring  rationale  go  a  long  way  in  balancing  the  inherent  subjectivity associated  with  a  qualitative  analysis,  and  assuring  decision  makers  that  the  benefit evaluation  was  based  on  sound  reasoning  and  represents  stakeholder/advisor  consensus  on the methodology. 56 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 5.4.2.  Financial  Management  Compliance.  Compliance  with  AFI  65-509  and  AFMAN  65-510 states analysis, inputs and rationale should be fully documented as part of the BCA, so that it is traceable and repeatable. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 57 Chapter 6 COST AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 6.1.  PS-BCA Cost Estimates. 6.1.1.  This  section  states  the  requirements  for  developing  credible,  defendable,  and  high quality  PS-BCA  cost  estimates.    The  intent  is  to construct  cost  estimates  for  all  considered COAs  which  appropriately  account  for  platform  maturity  and  which  can  be  thoroughly documented, easily replicated, and utilized to effectively inform the MDA.  Further detailed guidance  on  developing  cost  estimates  for  PS-BCAs  can  be  found  in  the  AFCAA  PS-BCA Cost Guidebook. Below are the criteria for completing credible, defendable, and high quality PS-BCA cost estimates: 6.1.1.1.  GR&As are reasonable and properly documented. 6.1.1.2.  Guided by the problem statement. 6.1.1.3.  Properly utilizes comparative analyses methods. 6.1.1.4.  Data is normalized and used in the estimate correctly. 6.1.1.5.  Data is normalized, projected and used in the estimate correctly. 6.1.1.6.  The  PS-BCA  model  and  cost  estimates  accurately  represent  the  PSS  for  each COA. 6.1.1.7.  Ensures cost risk is handled consistently for each COA. 6.1.1.8.  Enables the decision maker to make the most informed decision possible. 6.2.  Criteria 1 – Guided by the Problem Statement. 6.2.1.  The  cost  analysis  is  guided  by  the  problem  statement  which  is  explained  in  section 3.2.6.1 of this pamphlet.  If the problem statement is a best value determination such as “The F-XX PS-BCA will determine the best value COA long-term sustainment strategy for the F-XX  unique  items  consistent  with  Air  Force  objectives,”  then  both  costs  and  benefits  are evaluated  and  the  cost  estimates  should  include  only  F-XX  unique  items.    If  the  problem statement  is  a  cost  effectiveness  analysis  such  as  “The  T-XX  PS-BCA  will  look  at  all strategies  that  reduce  cost  while  keeping  performance  the  same,”  then  cost  is  the  only variable  and  the  estimates  should  keep  performance  the  same  across  all  COAs.    If  the problem statement is a fixed budget optimization, such as “maximize performance of the B-XX  while  not  exceeding  a  $XXM  threshold,”  then  the  performance  criteria  should  be adjusted  until  the  corresponding  cost  estimate  is  under  the  dollar  threshold.  The  problem statement  clearly  defines  the  purpose  of  the  decision  that  the  cost  analysis  is  intended  to support.    The  data  collected  and  analyses  performed  are  focused  on  providing  the  decision maker as much information as possible for the problem being addressed and the criteria being used to make the decision. 6.3.  Criteria 2 – GR&As are Reasonable and Documented. 6.3.1.  The GR&As for the cost analysis should be reasonable, documented, and constructed to  aid  the  PS-BCA  IPT  in  building  credible,  defendable,  and  high  quality  cost  estimates.   Relevant  GR&As  should:  (1)  address  elements  that  drive  a  cost  delta  between  COAs;  (2) 58 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 ensure  the  PS-BCA  is  fair,  balanced,  and  a  realistic  comparison  across  all  COAs;  and  (3) have  coordination  from  the  IAP  member  organizations.    The  rationale  and  source  for  each GR&A should be included. 6.3.2.  Example: When transitioning from  contractor maintained components to government maintained  components,  it  would  be  reasonable  to  assume  that  Interim  Contract  Support (ICS)  may  be  required  for  a  few  years  while  organic  capabilities  are  being  prepared.    The corresponding  ground  rule  might  be:    For  COAs  standing  up  additional  government  repair, assume four years of ICS, then transition to government. 6.4.  Criteria 3 – Properly Utilizes the Various Types of Analysis. 6.4.1.  The  PS-BCA  is  a  comparative  analysis.    The  categories  of  costs  included  in  a comparative analysis are governed by OMB Circular A-94 and differ from the categories of costs included in other program cost estimates. 6.4.2.  Comparative Analysis:  A comparative analysis is any type of analysis examining the costs,  benefits  and  risks  of  alternative  ways  of  achieving  a  given  objective  or  fulfilling  a need. 6.4.2.1.  For  comparative  analyses,  OMB  Circular  A-94  requires  an  “incremental”  cost approach. 6.4.2.2.  Do not include sunk costs, as these costs do not factor into the decision.  When the magnitude and timing of a cost or benefit is identical for all alternatives, they can be considered as “common costs” (also called “wash costs”) or benefits.  Common costs that do  not  add  any  additional  information  to  the  decision-making  process  may  be  excluded from  the  comparison.  Caution  should  be  taken  when  identifying  common  costs  to confirm  that  costs  or  benefits  excluded  are  identical  for  all  alternatives.  Additionally, common costs should not  be excluded should there be  a requirement to  reflect  the total program costs. 6.4.2.3.  Caution. Other program  estimates based on the total cost  of the program  won’t match the cost estimate used for comparative analysis in the PS-BCA.  Typical examples include the Life Cycle Cost Estimate (LCCE) generated to support milestone decisions or generated for budget  purposes.  While an  LCCE can be the starting point of a PS-BCA cost  estimate,  adjustments  should  be  made  to  ensure  that  only  incremental  costs  are included,  that  sunk  and  wash  costs  are  removed,  and  any  other  relevant  changes  (e.g., Labor Rates – see below) are made to meet the requirements for a comparative analysis. 6.4.2.4.  Pitfall. The cost estimates used in the PS-BCA for  comparative analysis do not include all the costs necessary for understanding the implementation cost of an alternative or for making a budget comparison.  Adjustments should be made to these estimates for use in any context outside the PS-BCA. 6.4.3.  Labor  Rates.  Labor  rates  required  for  the  PS-BCA  should  be  different  than  those needed for full or total cost of the program estimates.  For organic depot labor calculations, the  PS-BCA  IPT  utilizes  the  incremental  labor  rate  portion  of  the  sales  rate/price  to customers to identify the cost of implementing the final chosen alternative. .  The PS-BCA is a  comparative  analysis  and  follows  an  incremental  cost  approach.    The  change  in  the AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 59 workload  distribution  as  a  result  of  the  PS-BCA  decision  could  change  the  organic  cost recovery sales rate/price and/or contractor labor rates. 6.4.3.1.  For  instance,  if  additional  work  is  taken  on  by  an  organic  depot,  more mechanics,  engineers,  floor  supervisors  and  material  would  be  needed  in  order  to complete  the  task.    These  incremental  costs  would  be  included  in  the  organic  depot incremental and full sales rates.  Note, an organic depot sales rate includes both labor and material.  However, the cost of the base commander, while part of the burdening and cost to a customer, is not an incremental cost and would not change with the decision to add workload  to  a  depot.    Therefore,  the  base  commander  cost  would  be  excluded  in  an incremental rate for a comparative analysis. In most cases, the incremental cost rate uses the full cost to recover Sales Rate as the baseline, and then removes all of the General & Administrative  Costs,  as  well  as  most  of  the  Production  Overhead  costs  –  only  leaving the  Indirect  Production  Material  costs  and  the  Shop  Operating  Material  costs  in  the Production Overhead category for Organic Depot Maintenance. 6.4.4.  Workload Impacts. The last part of the analysis would be to determine if the decrease in  workload  impacts  other  customers.    For  example,  if  the  decision  was made  to  move  full maintenance  support  for  weapon  system  (A)  from  organic  depot  maintenance  support  to  a contractor, organic labor rates may increase due to the change in workload being supported through  the  Air  Force  Working  Capital  Fund.    Similarly  a  change  in  workload  for  a contractor  could  impact  a  contractor’s  business  base  and  labor  rates—though  this  type  of impact would be difficult to determine without a contractor’s help. 6.4.4.1.  In  addition  to  changes  in  direct  costs,  the  PS-BCA  IPT  should  be  aware  that  a change in workload could drive price changes to unrelated commodities or services. This will definitely impact the taxpayer and should be taken into consideration.  For a more in-depth discussion of incremental vs. full analysis impacts on labor rates, refer to AFCAA PS-BCA Cost Guidebook. 6.5.  Criteria 4 – Properly Utilizes the Highest Quality Data Available. 6.5.1.  Section  9  of  this  pamphlet  specifically  addresses  data  selection,  collection  and assessment for PS-BCAs. 6.6.  Criteria 5 – Data is Normalized, Projected and Used Correctly. 6.6.1.  Gathering relevant data is vital to having a high quality cost estimate.  Since data can be  gathered  from  a  variety  of  sources,  it  is  often  in  many  different  forms  and  needs  to  be adjusted  before  being  used  to  enable  apples-to-apples  comparisons  (i.e.,  so  COAs  can  be compared without unintended bias) or as a basis for projecting future costs.  The process of adjusting  the  data  to  enable  an  apples-to-apples  comparison  is  called  normalization.    The analyst  should  thoroughly  document  the  normalization  process  and  adjustments  performed throughout the cost estimating process.  Data requires normalization for a number of reasons, some of which are discussed below. 6.6.2.  Inflation  and  Price  Escalation.    Inflation  and  price  escalation  are  important  and necessary  in  developing  a  credible  cost  estimate  and  in  normalizing  existing  data.    They should not be used interchangeably. 60 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 6.6.2.1.  AFI  65-502  defines  inflation  as  the  general  rise  in  price  level  over  time  or  the decreasing purchasing power of the dollar over time.  In application, this means that, for a given number of dollars, less goods could be purchased 10 years in the future than today.  As a result, in order to utilize cost data from an antecedent platform, the cost estimating team should need to adjust the source data to remove the effect of inflation to ensure that all  dollars,  regardless  of  time,  have  the  same  value  (i.e.,  purchasing  power).    Collected data  should  be  analyzed  to  determine  the  base  year  of  the  data.    If  the  base  year  of  the data differs from the base year of the PS-BCA, then the data should be adjusted to the PS-BCA’s base year before proceeding. 6.6.2.2.  Price escalation refers to  the total  change in  price of specific  goods or services over a specific period of time.   It  includes both  inflation and the “real  price change” of the good or service.  The “real price change” is the difference between inflation and the total change in price, and is caused by changes in the market (supply and demand).  The ‘real  price  change’  is  the  remaining  price  change  after  normalizing  for  inflation.    The term “constant dollar” implies prices have been normalized for inflation only.  The term “constant  price”  implies  prices  have  been  normalized  for  both  inflation  and  market forces.  In application, care has to be taken to ensure that all alternatives are normalized for inflation, price escalation, or both. 6.6.2.3.  Price  escalation  should  be  accounted  for  in  the  PS-BCA  estimates  for  cost elements whose prices are volatile or change at a significantly different rate than inflation (e.g., fuel, specialized labor, etc.).  Escalation rates reflect not only inflation, but also the “real”  price  change  of  a  good  or  service  and  deserve  special  consideration  in  order  to properly normalize data for use in an  estimate.  The Air Force specifies price escalation indices  for  fuel,  medical  and  government  employee  (military  and  civilian)  pay  and provides  access  to  Global  Insight  indices  for  other  goods  and  services  (see  the SAF/FMCE website). Figure 6.1.   Illustration of Inflation, Price Escalation, and Real Price Change.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 61 6.6.2.4.  Best  Practice:    Assume  the  same  escalation  rate  beyond  known  periods  for  all estimates.  Do not assume that one COA will escalate in a vastly different manner in the far future unless the basis for that assumption can be firmly documented. 6.6.2.5.  Caution/Pitfall:    Setting  unrealistic  escalation  assumptions  or  picking  an escalation  rate  “out  of  the  air.”    Because  of  the  compounding  nature  of  such  rates, unrealistic  assumptions  could  drive  or  bias  results.    Utilize  formal  price  indices  and forecasts (e.g., Global Insight indices, AF indices on SAF/FMCE website) as the basis for the escalation assumptions. 6.6.2.6.  Cost (e.g., content of cost, currency conversions). Units – Cost data needs to be converted to equivalent units before being used in a data set.  That is, costs expressed in thousands,  millions,  or  billions  of  dollars  be  converted  to  the  same  format  or denomination. 6.6.2.7.  Content  of  Cost  –  The  cost  estimator  needs  to  understand  what  the  cost  data includes  and  ensure  the  content  matches  the  support  strategy  being  estimated.    For example, does it only include direct labor or does it include overhead and the contractor’s profit as well? 6.6.2.8.  Currency  Conversion  –  Similarly,  if  costs  are  reported  in  different  currencies, they should be converted into U.S. dollars in order to have a like comparison. 6.6.2.9.  Sizing:  Sizing normalizes data to a common qualitative and quantitative metric.  When normalizing data for size, it is important to define exactly what the item represents: What constitutes a software line of code?  Does it include carriage returns or comments?  The main point is to clearly define what the sizing metric is so the data can be converted to a common standard before being used in the estimate. 6.6.2.10.  Normalizing data for usage or quantity is another example of sizing to ensure a common standard before including the data in an estimate.  Figure 6.2 lists some of the common usage or quantity normalizations seen in PS-BCAs. Figure 6.2.  Considerations When Normalizing Data for Usage or Quantity (or Duration). 6.6.2.10.1.  Key  Groupings:    Key  groupings  normalize  data  by  similar  missions, characteristics,  or  operating  environments  by  cost  type  or  work  content.    Products with  similar  mission  applications  have  similar  characteristics  and  traits,  as  do products  with  similar  operating  environments.    For  example,  space  systems  exhibit characteristics  different  from  those  of  submarines,  but  the  space  shuttle  has  62 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 characteristics distinct from those of a satellite even though they may share common features.  Costs should also be grouped by type.  For example, costs should be broken out between recurring and nonrecurring or fixed and variable costs. 6.6.2.10.2.  Life-Cycle  Effects/Productivity  and  Technology  Maturity:    Life-cycle effects  should  be  considered  when  comparing  data  from  different  programs.    For example,  entering  technology  typically  follows  a  reliability  improvement  curve  and would  require  normalization  to  be  compared  to  steady  state  data.    Likewise, technology  improves  over  time,  so  historic  cost  data  may  need  to  be  normalized  to adjust  for  productivity  or  quality  improvements  resulting  from  technological advancements over time. 6.6.2.10.3.  All normalization actions should be documented.  Price indices are often hard  to  find,  so  it’s  important  that  the  source  of  the  indices  are  documented.    If  the cost analysis team constructed a price index for use in the PS-BCA cost estimate, the reasoning and process used in constructing the index should be documented as well.  For  additional  information  on  data  collection  and  the  reason  to  use  certain  data sources  (especially  if  multiple  sources  exist),  refer  to  Section  9  of  this  pamphlet which specifically addresses data collection. 6.6.2.10.4.  For additional guidance on inflation and price escalation and how to apply them properly in cost estimates, refer to AFI 65-502, Inflation, and the AFCAA PS-BCA Cost Guidebook. 6.7.  Criteria 6 – Cost Estimates Accurately Represent the PSS for Each COA. 6.7.1.  The PS-BCA model is a decision-support tool used to produce cost estimates for each COA.    In  order  to  effectively  support  the  decision  maker,  it  needs  to  represent  the  PSS relationships.  To do this, the cost analyst requires clear technical and programmatic direction to properly construct the model so that it produces cost estimates that reflect the PSS for each COA  as  accurately  as  possible.    In  addition,  the  PS-BCA  IPT  should  have  a  basic understanding of how the cost model works to ensure that it accurately represents the PSS for all alternatives. 6.7.2.  Vector Checks. While developing the cost estimating model, the PS-BCA IPT should seek periodic vector checks early and often to ensure the model being constructed accurately represents the PSS programmatic and technical content for each COA, not the COA’s “cost behavior.” 6.7.2.1.  In  addition  to  cost  personnel,  include  technical  and  functional  personnel  in  the vector  checks  to  provide  a  fresh  perspective  on  the  cost  model  and  to  review  its consistency with the PSS. 6.7.3.  Cost Review Process. Do not wait until the estimate is near completion before starting the cost review process.   This can lead to the realization that the entire PS-BCA estimating framework is incorrect which would require a considerable amount of rework and delay the already lengthy process to complete the PS-BCA. 6.7.4.  Productivity  Gains  and  Cost  Avoidance.  Efficiencies  produced  by  an  alternative  that result  only  in  additional  time  for  personnel  to  perform  other  duties,  but  will  not  result  in reduced manning or operating costs, should be addressed in the benefits analysis of the EA, AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 63 not  the  cost  analysis  since  costs  won’t  change.    For  a  complete  discussion  on  productivity gains and cost avoidance, reference AFMAN 65-510, section 2.2.15.5.1. 6.8.  Criteria 7 – Ensure Cost Risk is Handled Consistently for Each COA. 6.8.1.  Cost risk needs to be evaluated.  Some PS-BCAs provide point estimates while others provide  cost  ranges  and  confidence  levels.    The  key  is  that  each  PS-BCA  should  be consistent in how it handles cost risk for each COA.  If a point estimate is provided for one COA,  then  a  point  estimate  needs  to  be  provided  for  all  COAs.    If  a  range  and  confidence levels are provided for one COA, then a range and confidence levels should be provided for all  COAs.  Risk  is  normally  defined  as  the  likelihood  of  a  negative  outcome  upon  which  a probability can be assigned. Uncertainty is assessed in cost estimate models for the purpose of  estimating  the  risk  (probability)  that  a  specific  funding  level  will  be  exceeded.  For additional  guidance  specifically  on  cost  risk,  refer  to  the  Joint  Agency  Cost  Schedule  Risk and Uncertainty Handbook. 6.8.2.  Cost  Risk.  An  example  of  cost  risk  is  the  risk  of  funding  technical  data  collection which  should  be  included  in  the  risk  analysis.    If  the  risk  can  be  quantified,  it  should  be included in  the cost  estimate section.  Stochastically modeled risk in  the cost  model should not be double counted by including it in the PS-BCA’s risk analysis (section 7.0). 6.9.  Criteria 8 – Enables Decision Maker to Make the Most Informed Decision Possible. 6.9.1.  The cost estimates for each COA need to be informative to the decision maker.  The most precise cost estimate that assumes away critical incremental costs that differ among the COAs or that doesn’t align with the intended PSS for that COA is not providing information that  is  essential.      In  the  end,  a  high  quality  PS-BCA  cost  estimate  is  one  that  informs  the decision maker with relevant cost information. 6.9.2.  Present Value. Additionally, cost estimates have to be presented in a manner that the COAs can be compared.  To make a meaningful comparison of COAs, all costs intended to be compared should be expressed in PV terms.  Using PV allows decision makers to consider future  money  streams  in  relation  to  the  current  value  of  money.    OMB  Circular  No.  A-94, Guidelines  and  Discount  Rates  for  Benefit  Cost  Analysis  of  Federal  Programs,  includes additional  information  and  guidance,  including  discount  rates  and  formulas  for  computing NPV.  AFMAN 65-510, Business Case Analysis Procedures, provides additional guidance on business case analysis. 64 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 7 RISK ASSESSMENT 7.1.  Introduction to Risk Assessment. 7.1.1.  After risks are identified, each risk factor should be defined in detail to ensure all PS-BCA  IPT members are interpreting the  risk in  the same  way.  Care should be taken in  this step  to  ensure  there  is  no  duplication  or  overlap  in  risk  factors.    Any  duplication  will inappropriately  skew  the  risk  analysis  and  invalidate  the  results.    If  methodologies  that aggregate cost, benefit and risk (such as Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)) are used in the PS-BCA, it is particularly important to ensure elements of cost, benefit and risk are mutually exclusive.  Any distortion in individual category results is amplified due to the weighting and scoring algorithms used with these methodologies. The process of comparing different COAs is  not  complete  until  a  risk  assessment  is  performed  on  each  COA.    AFPAM  63-128, Chapter 12 provides the AF standard for risk assessment and this pamphlet adds additional fidelity to the subject.  Risk should be treated separately from cost and benefits.  The analysis of risk should be based on probability and the impact of an event. One COA may be the most cost  effective  but  could  be  assessed  as  high  risk  due  to  technical,  operational  or  other  risk classifications. 7.2.  Defining Risk. 7.2.1.  It  is  difficult  to  discuss  risk  without  discussing  and  defining  the  distinction  between risk and uncertainty. Risk, in its simplest sense, is the chance (probability) of loss or injury.  Uncertainty is the indefiniteness about the outcome of a situation in which both favorable and unfavorable events can occur.  Risk is then the probability of an unfavorable event occurring that is the result of our uncertainty about a situation.  In the sustainment of a weapon system, risk  can  be  defined  as  an  uncertain  event  or  condition  that,  if  it  occurs,  can  have  negative effects on the implementation of the PSS.  It addresses the potential variation in the planned approach and its expected outcome.  While such variations could include positive as well  as negative  effects,  this  pamphlet  emphasizes  the  negative  future  effects  (i.e.  risk;  not uncertainty).    Risk  management  for  a  PS-BCA  involves  the  identification  of  potential  risks for each COA, assessing probability and impact of identified risks, developing a response to the  risks,  and  finally  monitoring  risks  over  time.    As  defined  in  the  DoD  Product  Support Guidebook,  risk  can  be  classified  as  Business  or  Programmatic,  Operational,  Suitability, Process, Technical, Schedule, Organizational, Sustainability, Safety, and Environmental.  A future  root  cause  is  the  most  basic  reason  for  the  presence  of  a  risk.    Accordingly,  risks should be tied to future root causes and their effects. In order to be considered a risk it should exhibit three key components. 7.2.2.  Future  Root  Cause.  A  future  root  cause  (yet  to  happen),  which,  if  eliminated  or corrected, would prevent a potential consequence from occurring. 7.2.3.  Probability.  A  probability  (or  likelihood)  assessed  at  the  present  time  of  that  future root cause occurring. 7.2.4.  Consequence. The consequence (or effect) of that future occurrence.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 65 7.3.  Progression of Risk. 7.3.1.  Risk  identification  and  analysis  should  evolve  and  mature  over  the  life  cycle  of  the system as a result of learning more about the aspects of the program and thus decreasing the uncertainty.  At MS B, system design is  still preliminary and consequently  product  support planning  depends  heavily  on  comparison  to  like  systems  as  will  modeling  and  simulation.  Identifying probability and impact at this phase may involve more qualitative analysis due to the  lack  of  actual  performance  data  or  dependence  on  analogous  systems  that  is  not  a complete  representation  of  the  new  system  in  development.    Identifying  and  mitigating moderate and high risks early in the system’s life cycle helps to avoid cost growth later.   For example, the use of proprietary software could increase risk in the area of sustainability due to dependence on a sole source versus using open source code capable of being supported by multiple providers.  As system design matures, the data and GR&As should also mature by aiding  with  the  identification  and  management  of  risk  involving  different  product  support COAs.    As  a  system  moves  through  the  acquisition  life  cycle,  data  availability  should improve the ability to assess performance and better identify potential sources of risk.  Risk management processes should  continue to  monitor identified risks and be watchful  for new risks as the system progresses through each life cycle phase. 7.4.  Classifications of Risk. 7.4.1.  When assessing risk, it is important to differentiate between risks that are of short or temporary  duration,  and  those  which  are  expected  to  continue  throughout  the  system  life cycle.  For example, a short-term risk, such as schedule risk due to a transition delay, should not be considered to be of the same severity as a long term risk that will continue throughout the  service  life  of  the  system.    Remember  that  risk  assessment  is  analyzing  risk  over  the entire analysis period. Alternatives with short-term transition risk should not be automatically labeled “high” or “moderate” risk, due to a transition risk that might cease to be a factor in a few  years,  and  which  would  constitute  a  fraction  of  the  service  life  of  the  system.    The potential for mitigation and the additional effort required to mitigate the risk should also be considered in the risk assessment. 7.5.  Risk Management Planning. 7.5.1.  Risk  management  planning  is  the  foundation  of  a  continuous  process  that  is accomplished  throughout  the  system’s  life  cycle.    It  is  an  organized  methodology  for continuously  identifying  and  measuring  unknowns;  selecting,  planning,  and  implementing appropriate  risk  mitigations;  and  tracking  the  implementation  to  ensure  successful  risk reduction.    Risk  Management  Planning  should  follow  a  standard  process  model  through  all phases of the system’s life cycle.   It  links a program’s risk management effort to  life cycle planning  by  answering  “who,  what,  where,  when,  and  how”  risk  management  should  be performed. 7.6.  Risk Identification. 7.6.1.  Risk  identification  is  the  second  step  in  the  risk  management  process.    The  best method  for  completing  this  step  is  to  assemble  a  team  of  SMEs  and  relevant stakeholders/advisors.    The  team  should  generate  a  list  of  all  the  possible  risks  that  could affect  a  COA  and  clearly  provide  rationale  or  basis  why  this  is  considered  a  risk.  Brainstorming  and  other  similar  techniques  should  be  used  to  identify  potential  problems.  66 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Later the list can be analyzed and filtered to eliminate unreasonable risks.  Risk identification is the activity that examines each element of the program to identify associated root causes, begin their documentation, and set the stage for their successful management.  Examination of  a  PSS  is  accomplished  through  decomposition  into  relevant  elements,  tasks  or  areas.  Decomposition  may  be  oriented  to  requirements,  processes,  functional  areas  or  technical baselines.  The team should guard against focusing on objectives versus the events that could produce the consequences (see example below). 7.6.2.  Example:  The  team  may  identify  failing  to  meet  maintenance  stand  up  schedule instead  of  the  events  that  could  cause  this  to  happen  (lack  of  manpower,  missing  technical data, lack of required tools/support equipment). 7.7.  Risk Analysis. 7.7.1.  Risk Analysis is the third step in the risk management process.  Once a list of risks has been  developed,  the  list  needs  to  be  analyzed  to  eliminate  redundant  risks  or  those  risks whose  impact  is  inconsequential.    Risk  management  resources  should  be  focused  on  risks that  have  the  highest  potential  impact.    Risk  can  be  assessed  in  terms  of  probability  and impact, the combination of these two factors determines which risks are the highest threats to a particular COA. 7.7.2.  Example:  A  provider  of  spare  parts  may  be  in  poor  financial  state  resulting  in  a credible  risk  of  going  out  of  business.    However,  if  the  part  is  also  available  from  several other vendors, the potential impact is minimal since other sources are available.  On the other hand,  if  a  part  is  rare,  sensitive  to  damage  in  shipping,  is  a  long-lead  item  and  has  few sources,  the  risk  of  losing  an  asset  could  be  assessed  as  high  as  could  the  impact  due  to inability to replace.  The bottom line for risk analysis is the process should critically examine both the probability and impact of each risk so sufficient planning can take place to  reduce either the exposure or the impact. 7.7.3.  Risk Matrix. A common approach for assessing both the probability and impact of risk is  the  use  of  the  risk  matrix.  The  risk  matrix  prioritizes  uncertainties  that  could  negatively impact  program  cost,  schedule  and  performance.  SMEs,  typically  engineers,  PMs, logisticians  and  others  familiar  with  the  program,  define  the  risk  factors,  probabilities,  and resulting impact to cost, schedule, performance or a combination thereof. 7.7.4.  Best  Practice:  Continuously  monitor  risks  to  ensure  awareness  of  events  that  may change  either  the  risk  likelihood  or  risk  impact.    Additionally,  mitigation  plans  should  be reviewed to ensure they are still valid. 7.8.  Risk Handling Planning & Implementation. 7.8.1.  Risk  Handling  Planning  &  Implementation  is  the  forth  step  in  the  risk  management process.    This  step  identifies,  evaluates,  and  selects  options  to  set  risk  at  acceptable  levels given  program  constraints  and  objectives.    Risk  Handling  Planning  &  Implementation  is intended to enable program success.  It includes the specifics of what should be done, when it should be accomplished, who is responsible, and the funding required to implement the risk mitigation plan.  The level of detail depends on the program life-cycle phase and the nature of  the  need  to  be  addressed.  However,  there  should  be  enough  detail  to  allow  a  general estimate  of  the  effort  required  and  technological  capabilities  needed  based  on  system complexity. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 67 7.8.2.  Risk  Mitigation.  Furthermore,  risk  handling  planning  &  implementation  focuses  on either reducing the likelihood that a risk event will occur and/or reduce the impact should the risk be realized. In many cases, the more cost effective option is to reduce the likelihood of a risk occurrence.  In the example of the vendor with financial troubles this may be mitigated by  setting  up  an  indefinite-delivery  indefinite-quantity  type  contract  with  multiple  vendors, thus  reducing  risk  from  sole  source  and  adding  opportunity  for  lower  cost  through competition.    Similarly,  the  choice  to  use  open  source  software  versus  proprietary  code would  mitigate  the  risk  of  depending  on  the  original  software  manufacturer  to  provide follow-on  support.    In  both  cases  the  likelihood  of  the  risk  event  happening  was  reduced through planning and design changes early in  the system life cycle.  However, not  all risks can  be  addressed  solely  though  reducing  the  likelihood  of  occurrence,  so  risk  mitigation plans should be developed to reduce their impact. The exercise of developing risk mitigation plans  is  also  a  useful  exercise  in  helping  to  identify  the  root  cause  of  a  risk  event.    In  the example of the item sensitive to shipping, having limited sources and long lead time may be mitigated by improving packaging,  shipping method or adding more robust materials in the design.    Deciding  which  mitigation  approach  is  most  appropriate  depends  on  knowing  the root  cause  of  damage  during  shipping.    Is  it  packaging,  shipping,  poor  quality  parts  or  a combination  of  each?    Knowing  this  from  the  risk  assessment  phase  helps  with  developing the most appropriate and cost effective risk mitigation plan. 7.8.3.  Risk  Avoidance  and  Transfer.  Two  other  approaches  to  risk  mitigation  are  risk avoidance and transferring of risk.  In risk avoidance, if a proposed PSS has an unacceptable level  of  risk  that  mitigation  planning  cannot  reduce  to  an  acceptable  level  (taking  into account  impacts  to  cost,  schedule,  performance),  it  may  be  best  to  avoid  that  COA.   Unfortunately, this is  not  always possible.   If a new weapon system is  dependent  on a new technology  that  is  critical  to  the  operation,  then  it  cannot  be  avoided  even  if  there  are significant risk issues.  This leads to the option of transferring risk. 7.8.4.  Risk  Transfer.  Transferring  risk  does  not  eliminate  the  risk  but  it  helps  reduce  the likelihood  by  sharing  the  negative  results.    One  example  is  using  fixed  price  contracts.    If production  costs  are  higher  than  projected  due  to  poor  quality,  a  fixed  price  contract  could place part of the cost burden onto the contractor.  This is a very simple example only meant to  point  out  that  part  of  the  risk  can  be  transferred  or  shared  helping  to  build  in  greater incentives  to  reduce  the  likelihood  or  impact  of  a  risk  event.    The  team  responsible  for completing the risk management process should thoroughly understand the risk to include its root cause to help plan for the best mitigation approaches. 7.9.  Risk Tracking  . 7.9.1.  Risk  tracking  is  the  fifth  and  final  step  of  the  risk  management  process.    Once  risk management  planning  has  identified  the  risks,  assessed  the  probability  and  impacts,  and developed mitigation plans, it is necessary to monitor and adjust the risk management plan as appropriate.  Early in the life cycle, monitoring is more focused on developmental planning and  adjusting  to  changes  in  design,  schedule  or  requirements.    However,  as  the  system matures,  product  support  shifts  from  planning  and  developing  to  executing.    Risk management is  a continuous process and should include a periodic review of risk to ensure no new risks have emerged and existing ones have not increased or decreased in probability or  impact.    If  a  risk  condition  has  changed  this  does  not  mean  the  PS-BCA  should  be  re-accomplished, it should instead drive implementation of risk mitigation or contingency plans 68 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 depending on the most appropriate course of action.  Monitoring risks should be an ongoing activity to remain aware of changes to the environment that may change either the likelihood or impact of risks. 7.10.  Risk Management Summary. 7.10.1.  The  purpose  of  risk  management  is  to  address  uncertainty  in  product  support planning  and  provide  the  information  required  for  decision  makers  to  understand  the tradeoffs  between  COAs.    In  addition,  risk  planning  provides  the  methods  necessary  to determine likelihood and impact of each risk and facilitates completing mitigation planning to  reduce  or  avoid  a  risk  occurrence.    Completing  the  process  thoroughly  and  thoughtfully will  assist  with  product  support  planning  and  ensure  mission  support  requirements  are executed at an acceptable cost level. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 69 Chapter 8 DETERMINING EVALUATION FRAMEWORK, WEIGHTING, AND SCORING 8.1.  Weighted Utility Score (WUS) and Multi-Objective Decision Analysis (MODA). 8.1.1.  The  preferred  methodology  for  evaluating  COAs  are  the  Weighted  Utility  Score (WUS) and the Multi-Objective Decision Analysis (MODA).  The two methodologies have similar steps but the level of information, calculation of results, and displays of results differ.  If  an  alternate  method  is  used,  it  should  be  fully  documented  and  coordinated  with  the Executive IAP (refer to the Roles and Responsibilities for the PS-BCA governance structure in Section 2). 8.2.  COA Evaluation. 8.2.1.  This  section addresses the approach for evaluating various COAs  with  respect  to  the top-level  categories  of  cost,  benefit,  and  risks.    The  first  requirement  in  using  the  WUS framework is  to  give  relative importance/value  (weighting) between  cost,  benefit,  and  risks and  receive  approval  of  the  weighting  from  the  Executive  IAP.    The  relative  balance  in weighting  is  used  to  frame  the  PS-BCA  assessment  of  the  various  COAs.    In  a  fiscally constrained environment it cannot be “benefits/performance” at any cost or “lower cost” with inadequate  “benefits/performance.”    The  Executive  IAP  prevents  the  perception  of  gaming and  safeguards  the  integrity  of  the  results  by  approving  weighting  before  collecting  data.  The goal is to make the COA assessments unbiased. 8.2.2.  WUS. The WUS is a summation of the weighted top-level categories of cost, benefit and  risk,  based  on  a  100-point  scale.    For  the  notional  example  below,  the  relative  balance (weighting) is: cost = 35, benefit = 45, and risks = 20. Figure 8.1.  Weighted Utility Score (WUS).  70 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Figure 8.2.  WUS Framework - No Weighting Assigned. 8.2.2.1.  An  example  of  the  initial  WUS  framework  with  all  the  weightings  assigned  is shown in Figure 8.3.  Figure 8.3.  WUS Framework – Criteria Weighting (Notional Data).  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 71 Figure 8.4.  MODA Framework – Criteria Weighting (Notional Data). 8.2.2.2.  When  using  the  MODA  framework,  the  benefits  hierarchy  focuses  on  benefits and cost remains independent.  The benefits hierarchy in MODA is different than the one in  WUS.    Additional  fidelity  on  using  MODA  can  be  found  in  Air  Force  Materiel Command’s Cost Capability Guidebook (May 2014).  8.3.  Steps to Build the WUS or MODA Framework. 8.3.1.  Identify  sub-categories  under  each  top-level  category  for  cost,  benefit,  and  risks.    If appropriate,  include  any  additional  sub-category  levels.    In  the  example  above,  sub-categories  under  “Benefit”  are  SE,  SCM,  and  Maintenance  Management.    For  the  sub-category  Maintenance  Management,  there  are  four  additional  sub-categories  (Aircraft, Engine, Software, Commodities). 8.3.2.  Cost.    Identify  sub-categories  under  cost,  however,  they  are  not  always  required  as demonstrated in the above example. 8.3.3.  Benefit.  The sub-categories should be consistent with those defined in the scope for IPS elements or grouping of IPS elements.  For example, the benefits which may have been identified are SE, SCM, and Depot Maintenance Management. 8.3.4.  Risks.  The sub-categories should match those identified in the previous Risks section.   Examples  of  the  risk  sub-categories  are  Transition  (complexity,  manpower,  time,  etc.), Environmental (political), Compliance with 50-50 or core laws, Investment, etc. 8.3.4.1.  Identify  metric(s)  to  measure  the  last/lowest  category  (if  no  sub-category)  or last/lowest sub-category level. 8.3.4.2.  After  identifying  the  levels  of  sub-categories,  determine  the  metrics  that  will measure  each  category  level.    As  each  metric  is  identified,  document  the  rationale  for selecting the metric for stakeholder/advisor understanding. 72 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 8.3.4.3.  Although  multiple  cost  metrics  can  be  considered  when  determining  the preferred alternative, NPV should be the only metric used in the valuation of cost. 8.3.4.4.  Below are some questions that can assist in identifying metrics: 8.3.4.4.1.  Is objective/quantitative when available)? the  metric  objective/quantitative  or  subjective/qualitative (Use 8.3.4.4.2.  Is the metric a direct measurement or will it be a surrogate measurement? 8.3.4.4.3.  Is the metric data auditable? 8.3.4.4.4.  Is the metric consistent across all sources (OEM, organic, and 3rd Party)?  If not, what is the mitigation plan? 8.3.4.4.5.  Is the metric a discriminator?  For example, the result from a metric under SCM sub-category will discriminate (which is  better) between organic,  OEM, or 3rd Party suppliers. 8.3.4.5.  These metrics should be applicable to the “as-is” COA since the “as-is” COA is the starting point for the PS-BCA.  The metrics should effectively align with the mission and contribute to meeting the PS requirements.  It is important to exercise caution when selecting a combination of metrics to ensure they are not redundant or counteractive.  It’s recommended  to  use  the  SMART  approach  to  measure  metrics  in  the  last/lowest  sub-categories. 8.3.4.5.1.  S  =  Specific:    The  value  of  the  metric  should  be  clear  to  avoid misinterpretation and it specifies the allowable range or threshold. 8.3.4.5.2.  M  =  Measurable:    The  unit  of  measure  is  specified  and  tied  to  the underlying data that allows for meaningful statistical analysis. 8.3.4.5.3.  A  =  Attainable:    For  the  “as-is”  COA  and  the  “to-be”  COAs,  the  metric should be achievable, reasonable, cost-effective, and credible. 8.3.4.5.4.  R  =  Relevant:    The  metric  should  be  valued  to  the  program  and  “as-is” state  of  the  program’s  PSS.    This  metric  should  already  be  tied  to  mission  and  PS-BCA requirements and appropriate to a specific level of scope and responsibility. 8.3.4.5.5.  T  =  Timely:    The  required  data  can  be  collected  and  analyzed  within  the established time frame. 8.3.5.  Determine  Data  Sources.  Determine  data  sources  for  each  metric  and  ensure  all sources  have  the  same  parameters  and  definition.    For  metrics,  any  difference  in  the parameters and definition (i.e., differences between organic data collected and contractor data collected)  should  have  a  mitigation  plan  before  scoring  or  weighting.    The  data  sources should be documented with the rationale for each metric from above (See example for CWT below in the section “Written Common Understanding and Frame of Reference”). 8.3.6.  Determine weighting and scoring plan.  As previously stated, only use the benefit sub-category for weighting within the MODA framework. 8.3.6.1.  The weighting and scoring plan should be developed by a select group of critical experts (CEs).   Any stakeholder or advisor who is  a CE with  a  business interest  in  the PS-BCA result should not be included in the select group which determines the weighting AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 73 and  scoring  plan  to  prevent  a  product  support  provider  conflict  of  interest  or  an organizational  conflict  of  interest.    For  MODA,  only  use  the  benefit  sub-category  for weighting. 8.3.6.2.  The  scoring  and  weighting  methodology  should  be  approved  by  the  Executive IAP.  The scoring plan should be completed prior to data collection.  It is recommended that  until  the  data  is  collected,  the  scoring  and  weighting  methodology  not  be  shared outside the select group and the Executive IAP.  Not sharing this methodology preserves the integrity of data collection, weighting, and scoring processes. 8.3.6.3.  Weighting  Approach:    The  select  group  of  CEs  should  begin  to  determine  the weighting values for each category, sub-category, and metric. 8.3.6.4.  It  is  very  important  that  for  each  sub-category/metric  to  ensure  the  cumulative impact  is  appropriate  as  determined  on  WUS  (especially  if  sub-category/metric  is  used more than once). 8.3.6.5.  In the Figure 8.5, the cumulative impacts are shown in the first three columns.  The weightings and metrics shown are examples only. Figure 8.5.  Cumulative Impacts of WUS.  74 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Figure 8.6.  Updated WUS Framework.  8.3.7.  Critical  Expert  Considerations.  Based  on  the  revised  weighting,  the  updated  WUS framework for assessing cost, benefit, and risks.  To prioritize the values for weighting across sub-categories or metrics, CEs need to have a common understanding of reference for each sub-category and metric.  Below are some, but  not  all, considerations to be provided to  the CEs. 8.3.7.1.  Written  parameters  and  definitions  for  each  sub-category  and  metric  to  be weighted.    The  SMEs  should  understand  any  difference  in  the  metric  parameters  and definition  (i.e.,  differences  between  the  organic  metric  collected  and  the  contractor metric) and the mitigation plan to enable equity before scoring or weighting. 8.3.7.2.  Example:  CWT  for  the  government  is  defined  as  the  time  between  when  the unit’s request for a part was initiated to when the part was delivered to the unit.  CWT for a  contractor  may  be  defined  as  the  time  between  when  the  contractor  gets  the  request from the government for the part to when it delivers the part to a port.  In this example, the  parameters  and  definition  for  CWT  is  not  the  same.    A  mitigation  plan  is  required before  using  CWT  as  a  sub-category  or  metric.    The  mitigation  can  be  an  actual correction or an estimate correction, but if possible, an actual correction is preferred and should be weighted more. 8.3.7.3.  Whether subjective/qualitative measure.  Objective/quantitative is preferred. the  sub-category  or  metric is  an  objective/quantitative  or 8.3.7.4.  Whether  the  sub-category  or  metric  is  a  direct  measurement  or  an  indirect measurement for the desired outcome.  Direct measurement is preferred. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 75 8.3.8.  Additional  Considerations.  The  following  is  a  list,  but  not  an  all-inclusive  list,  of additional considerations that needs addressing when using CEs to accomplish the weighting: 8.3.8.1.  CEs’ inputs should only apply to their areas of expertise. 8.3.8.2.  Retain the ability to identify each CE’s input for later sensitivity analysis. 8.3.8.3.  Ensure equitable CE impact – one CE, or one organization CE group, should not be able to independently influence results. 8.3.8.4.  Ensure  CEs  are  of  an  appropriate  level  and  expertise  (consideration  of experience and position). 8.3.9.  Scoring  Approach:    After  identifying  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  categories  and metrics, the selected  group of SMEs then determine the scoring plan for  each  category  and metric. 8.3.10.  Numerical  Responses.    Numerical  responses  are  normalized  using  either  the maximum  or  minimum  score  across  a  metric.    The  following  is  how  this  scoring  can  be determined: 8.3.10.1.  Highest Number is desired.  The highest number for all the responses across all the  COAs  receives  the  maximum  points.    The  numbers  for  the  remaining  responses should be scored by linear normalization to the highest number.   This approach should be adjusted accordingly if averages of the numbers are used to determine the score. 8.3.10.2.  Lowest Number is desired.  The lowest number for all the responses across all the  COAs  receives  maximum  points.      This  approach  should  be  adjusted  accordingly  if averages of the numbers are used to determine the score. 8.3.10.3.  “Yes”  or  “No”  Responses.    Where  “Yes”  response  is  desired.  Scoring:  “Yes” answer receives all the points. 8.4.  Displaying the Results – WUS and MODA (Cost Capability Analysis). 8.4.1.  Choosing how to display the results is important.  Some decision makers prefer seeing “numbers” (WUS), while others prefer a more visual display (MODA) of the results, and yet others prefer seeing both displays.  Both methods are discussed in the following sub-sections. 8.4.2.  Displaying  WUS  Results.  When  assessing  the  WUS  results,  one  should  understand what  a  higher  score  represents.    For  example,  take  the  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (IRR)  and investment  cost  metrics  -  a  higher  IRR  is  better,  while  a  lower  investment  is  better. Therefore,  a  higher  IRR  and  a  low  investment  cost  will  each  result  in  a  higher  WUS number/value,  however,  this  scoring  method  sometimes  may  be  counter  intuitive.    To  help understand the WUS number/value for both cost and risk, these areas are also colored (high cost or high risk is colored Red; medium cost or medium risk is colored Yellow; low cost or low  risk  is  colored  Green).    The  “color  coding”  for  each  cost  and  risk  is  independently determined based on the sub-categories and metrics for each area.  Documenting the rationale for the color coding of each area is required. 8.4.2.1.  In  the  example,  total  WUS  weighting  for  risk  is  20.    Using  the  risk  cube framework (Figure 8.7.): High risk has a score of 4 or less, medium risk a score between 76 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 greater than 4 and less than 10, and low risk has a score greater than equal to or greater than 10. Figure 8.7.  Risk Cube.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 77 Figure 8.8.  COA Weighting. Figure 8.9.  WUS Display (Example 1).   78 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Figure 8.10.  WUS Display (Example 2). 8.4.2.2.  WUS Assessment.  8.4.2.2.1.  Assessing  the  total  score  across  the  COAs,  COA  2  and  COA  3  have  the highest scores, 55 and 54 respectively.  These values are almost the same, however, the  components  (Cost,  Benefit,  Risks)  of  the  score  should  also  be  assessed  for  the complete context and understanding. 8.4.2.2.2.  Assessing benefits  between COA 2  and COA 3, COA 3 (WUS = 32) has more than twice the benefits compared to COA 2 (WUS = 15); therefore, COA 3 is better than COA 2 based on benefits. 8.4.2.2.3.  Assessing  the  cost  between  COA  2  and  COA  3,  COA  2  (WUS  =  23) scored almost twice as high as COA 3 (WUS = 13); therefore, COA 2 is better than COA 3 based on cost.  Also, COA 3’s NPV is $2M more than COA 2. 8.4.2.2.4.  Assessing  the  risk  between  COA  2  and  COA  3,  COA  3  (WUS  =  9)  has almost  twice  the  risk  score  compared  to  COA  2  (WUS  =17),  therefore  COA  2  is better than COA 3 based on risk. 8.4.3.  Displaying MODA Results. 8.4.3.1.  When using MODA, benefits are plotted against the NPV rather than just against the  single  cost  of  implementing  a  COA.    Comparing  benefits  only  to  cost  can  be misleading  in  determining  best  value.    For  example,  COA  1  can  have  low  one-time implementation  costs  with  high  recurring  costs  with  little  savings  over  the  life-cycle; while  COA  2  can  have  high  one-time  implementation  costs  with  lower  recurring  costs and high savings over the life-cycle. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 79 8.4.3.2.  Converting WUS benefits for MODA graphing.  In the example, the total WUS weighting for benefits is 45 (Qualitative plus Quantitative).  Therefore, for each COA the associated WUS benefit score is converted to a total benefit scale of 100 point resulting in: COA 1 = 26.7, As Is= 24.4, COA 2 = 33.3, COA 3 =71.1, and COA 4 = 75.6.   Each COA  is  plotted  where  the  benefit  score  is  on  the  Y-axis  and the  NPV  is on  the  X-axis.   The risk color for each COA is then overlaid on the graph.  Using the NPV for the COAs takes these costs and savings into consideration.  Thus, plotting benefits against NPV for each  COA  and  then  overlaying  risk  for  each  COA  helps  decision  makers  determine which  COA  is  the  best  value.  In  the  example,  for  each  COA  the  benefits  are  given  a weighted  score  and  then  plotted  against  NPV.    The  risk  is  color  coded  and  displayed.  The size of the risk area shown is directly related the WUS for risk. Figure 8.11.  MODA.  8.4.3.3.  Both  COA  3  and  COA  4  have  higher  benefits  (over  twice  the  benefit  score compared to the other COAs).  COA 3 has medium risk while COA 4 has high risk. 8.4.3.4.  COA 1, COA 2, and “as-is” have low risks and lower benefits. 8.4.4.  Both the WUS and MODA Overall Assessment. The tradeoff for the decision maker between COA 2 and COA 3 is what is more important:  Higher benefits or lower cost and/or lower  risk.    If  high  benefits  is  the  most  important  and  the  medium  risk  is  acceptable,  then COA 3 is the better COA.  If lower costs and/or lower risk are more important, then COA 2 is  the  better  COA.    The  decision  makers  conducts  the  tradeoff  evaluation  and  selects  the better COA accordingly. 8.4.5.  Summary of Key Points. 8.4.5.1.  As  each  sub-category  and  metric  is  identified,  document  the  rationale  for  its selection. 8.4.5.2.  Ensure that for each sub-category/metric, the cumulative impact is appropriate as determined (especially if a sub-category/metric is used more than once). 80 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 8.4.5.3.  In  order  to  prioritize  the  values  for  weighting  across  sub-category  or  metrics, SMEs  need  to  have  a  common  understanding  and  frame  of  reference  for  each  sub-category and metric.  Therefore, provide written documentation to the SMEs. 8.4.5.4.  Display  the  results  in  a  clear  format  that  can  be  easily  understood  by  decision makers. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 81 Chapter 9 DATA SELECTION, COLLECTION AND ASSESSMENT 9.1.  Quality Data Collection. 9.1.1.  Within the PS-BCA process, quality data collection is often one of the most difficult and  time  consuming  activities.    In  order  to  perform  a  quality  PS-BCA,  the  PS-BCA  IPT should  clearly  understand  what  data  is  required  and  ensure  it’s  available  and  acceptable  to support  the  analysis.    Even  though  a  program  may  technically  comply  with  various  DoD Instruction and other sustainment cost reporting requirements, the data collected may not be of sufficient fidelity to effectively accomplish a cost estimate.  Therefore, before any data is collected, the PMO should document, in a data collection and management plan (data plan), how  the  team  will  locate,  collect,  verify,  and  use  data  to  ensure  the  data  is  collected  at  a sufficient level for effective use in the PS-BCA.  The data plan should focus on strategy early in  the  acquisition  lifecycle.    This  information  is  important  because  it  helps  the  PMO  to determine what data is required for future analysis (e.g., BCAs) and long-term sustainment.  This  should  also  assist  the  program  office  in  determining  which  data  rights  to  include  in future  contracts.  The  data  collection  should  include  quantitative  and  qualitative  data  to support  benefit,  cost,  and  risk  analyses.  The  resulting  data  plan  should  be  coordinated through  the  IAP  structure  to  ensure  reasonable  expectations  are  agreed  upon  by  all stakeholders  and  advisors.  PMO  should  ensure  proper  agreements  are  in  place  not  only  for data, but to include acceptable delivery per PMO requirements. 9.2.  Data Selection. 9.2.1.  For  the  purposes  of  the  PS-BCA,  data  selection  is  defined  as  the  process  of determining the appropriate data type and source to support the analysis.  There are two key components  of  the  data  selection  process:  1)  identification  of  data  requirements  and  2) quality assessment of potential data sources. 9.2.2.  Identification  of  Data  Requirements.  The  first  step  in  developing  the  data  plan  is identifying  potential  data  requirements  (both  financial  and  non-financial).    The  product support framework, documented in the LCSP, should be the basis for the PS-BCA and data requirement.  During MS A/B in the life cycle, the intent of the PS-BCA is more closely tied to creating the initial product support framework and identifying potential data requirements such as technical data and data rights that will support a more detailed PS-BCA later in the life cycle.  However, for MS C and beyond, data is more detailed and system specific, and is collectively agreed to be the most applicable and representative data to support the PS-BCA as further discussed in the following sections. Table 9.1.  Milestone Data Maturity. Data Prior to MS B Data Between MS B and MS C Prior to MS B, the program office ensures the information and data needed is being captured and be delivered to the government by the developing contractors. Between MS B and MS C, the program office use the COAs for the PSS, the proposed methodology, and the delivery of information and data developed and determined prior to MS B. 82 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Data Post MS C Once MS C is reached, the program office should have actual data and the focus should be on identifying any new, updated, and/or changed data. 9.2.2.1.  The  data  collected  for  the  PS-BCA  will  usually  be  a  direct  reflection  of  the platform maturity but should be reviewed periodically throughout the life cycle to ensure the data being collected supports the objectives of the PS-BCA.  As the system matures, platform  specific  data  should  become  more  readily  available.    When  completing  a  PS-BCA early in the platform lifecycle, specific platform data may not be available.  During this time in the lifecycle, it’s an accepted practice to use data from an analogous platform (see “Using Data from Analogous Systems” tip below).  However, when available, more detailed cost  data provides more confidence in  the distinctions  between COAs resulting in a higher quality cost estimate.  Too often, cost data from the contractor is collected at such a high level  it cannot  be used effectively in completing  an estimate  without major concerns.   For  example, in  order to  accurately  estimate the SE cost  for  a  new airframe, one needs more detailed cost information than the total SE cost for the entire antecedent platform.    Without  the  break  out  of  specific  cost  for  SE  for  the  airframe,  engines,  and Depot  Level  Repairables  (DLRs),  a  cost  analyst  has  to  make  what  could  be  a  faulty assumption in  an attempt to  allocate the specific  cost  to  the airframe.  The team  should consider  using  systems  which  have  a  predominately  organic  sustainment  strategy  as analogous data points. 9.2.2.2.  If  contractor  data  is  required,  the  PSM  works  closely  with  cost  analysts, logisticians,  and  contracting  officers  to  ensure  the  proper  data  is  contracted  for  and executed from the beginning of the life cycle of the program.  The PMO should plan to acquire government rights and the delivery of technical data as required by 10 U.S. Code § 2320.  However, if a platform is in the sustainment phase and is being supported by a CLS  contract  worth  $50M  or  more  (and  software  efforts  greater  than  $20M),  the  PMO needs to complete a comprehensive Cost & Software Data Report (CSDR) plan package in accordance with DoDI 5000.02.  The data collected from the CSDR can then be used as  a  baseline  for  the  revalidation  or  for  another  study.  In  addition,  tailoring  the  CSDR allows information to be collected in a specific area of interest (e.g., airframe SE), giving analysts a quality starting point to begin an estimate. 9.2.2.3.  As  data  is  collected,  the  PMO  executes  a  cohesive  plan  for  archiving  and efficiently  providing  the  data  as  appropriate  to  the  various  stakeholders/advisors.    All parties  should  understand  how  the  data  choices  impact  the  PS-BCA  problem  statement.  Not  collecting  the  correct  functional  and  cost  data  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  the  PS-BCA and hinders, delays, or inhibits future decision making efforts. Therefore, having a plan and a sustained commitment in place to collect the most accurate and useable data as it  becomes  available  should  make  the  current  PS-BCA,  and  all  subsequent  PS-BCAs, more informative  and accurate  while also  minimizing uncertainty or risk.   For more in-depth information regarding authoritative data sources and the proper application, see the AFCAA PS-BCA Guidebook. 9.2.2.3.1.  The questions listed below can aid the PS-BCA IPT identify potential data requirements to support the analysis: AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 83 9.2.2.3.2.  What is the problem statement?  What data is needed to properly evaluate the problem statement? 9.2.2.3.3.  What metrics are proposed to support the benefits evaluation?  What type of metric data is needed to support the evaluation of this metric? 9.2.2.3.4.  What  are  the  differentiators  across  the  COAs  selected?    What  level  of information/data is needed to effectively evaluate those differences?  For example, if the COA set considers organic versus contractor SCM, what type of data is needed to evaluate  the  different  cost,  benefit  or  risks  associated  with  the  different  product support providers? 9.2.2.3.5.  Are the proposed data elements easily applied across all potential product support providers (i.e.,   organic or contractor providers)? 9.2.2.3.6.  What are the program’s data rights and/or ease of access to data? 9.2.2.3.7.  When  will  the  data  be  generated?    What  level  of  data  is  needed  to differentiate across the COAs? 9.2.2.3.8.  Is there a mitigation plan if the data is unavailable? 9.2.2.4.  Quality  Assessment  of  Potential  Data  Sources.  The  next  step  is  examining potential data sources and assessing the quality of the proposed data.  The term “quality data” is defined as data that achieves its purpose or use.  Attributes of quality data include accuracy, precision, completeness, consistency, timeliness, and authority.  Table 9.2. and Table 9.3. below outline the data quality tiers, along with potential PS-BCA data sources which include corresponding tiers. Table 9.2.  Data Quality Tiers.

Additional considerations regarding data sources: 9.2.2.5.1.  To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  the  authoritative  data  source  should  be accurate  and  reliable.  Manage  expectations  of  desirable  data  sources  to  ensure accuracy, consistency, timeliness, availability, and relevance. 9.2.2.5.2.  Make efforts to only use non-proprietary data in a PS-BCA so subsequent iterations of the PS-BCA can be accomplished or updated. 9.2.2.5.3.  Interim Contract Support can be written to collect data which may then be used for sourcing decisions and costing out Contract Logistics Support 9.2.2.5.4.  At the end of the data selection process, the PS-BCA IPT should have a list of  the  required  data,  an  identified  source,  and  documented  rationale  as  to  why  that data  element  was  selected.  Table  9.4  below  provides  an  example  format  to  capture this information. The PS-BCA IPT should complete a separate table for cost, benefit, and risks data. Table 9.4.  Example – Data Requirements and Selection. Data element (e.g. WBS or IPSE)    Data Source POC/Office Organizational POC Level of Data Quality/Tier             Reason Source was Selected     9.2.2.6.  Data Collection. Once the necessary  data has been identified, the PS-BCA  IPT develops  the  data  collection  procedures,  collection  schedule,  entry  documentation,  data protection, data access/storage, and mitigation plan if the data is  unavailable.  Having a documented data plan is mandatory and is key to ensuring all PS-BCA players have the appropriate access to data and information.  When documenting sources, include the data source,  vendor,  point  of  contact,  and  the  date  the  data  was  obtained.    Open  source  data obtained  from  the  internet  should  include  the  website  address,  product/report  number, contract number (if available), and CDRL (if available). 86 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Table 9.5.  Data Plan Considerations. Data Plan Areas  Considerations Data Collection  Establish rules of engagement for collecting data. Identify who, within the PMO, will be responsible for requesting, collection and distributing data.  It is recommended that this be a single person within the PMO responsible for the PS-BCA.  This individual should be a government employee, not a support contractor. Identify entry/exit points for data requests within supporting stakeholder/advisor organizations (e.g., MAJCOM POCs, Contractors, AFSC). If the data is pulled from an automated system, decide who is going to validate the data pulls.  Also, consider what criteria will be used for QA, validation, etc. Determine how non-availability of data will be addressed and how issues will be mitigated. Decide if data will be provided in hard copy or electronically.  If electronically, will it be in Excel or PDF? MS Office is highly recommended not only for PMO and analytical purposes, but also for higher level agency review and oversight. Determine if a data call is required. It is recommended that a formal request for data come from the senior decision maker to emphasize the importance of timely support.   Periodically assess the data being delivered/collected supports upcoming PS-BCAs  Note:  Each functional organization providing data is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data (e.g., 448 SCMW for supply chain data, AFSC/LG for workload information, AFSC/FZ for organic rates and cost data, and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) or Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) for contract cost data). Determine dates the data is required to support the PS-BCA schedule. Establish suspense dates for the data requested. Identify what actions should occur if suspense date is not met. What levels should this be elevated to in order to resolve missed suspense dates? What mitigating actions should be taken to keep the PS-BCA on schedule? Collection Schedule Entry Documentation  Determine who will be responsible for documentation of data. Determine how data will be documented: Date Received/Retrieved Query Parameters Utilized (if pulled from automated system) Format Received (hardcopy, electronic, etc.) Data Storage (SharePoint, etc.)? AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 87 Data Plan Areas  Considerations Data Protection Identify any non-disclosure, security issues.   Determine if special access or permission is required before the data is released. Data Storage/Access  Determine if the data will be accessed via a web system, MS Excel, or other means.   Determine if the data needs to be available to everyone on the PS-BCA IPT. If not, document the rationale for any exclusion.   9.2.2.7.  Provided below are common mistakes that occur in the data collection process: Failure to be specific when requesting data or misunderstanding of data requirements regarding the information to be collected. Ignoring data used in previous estimates (when it applies). Not using data from preferred or best available sources (i.e. AF or DoD derived data) when available. Using manufacturer data that may represent a base case scenario. Not clearly stating the source and date of the data. Not presenting data in a format that can be analyzed/recreated by an independent reviewer. 9.2.3.  Data Assessment. Once collected, the team needs to review the data since flawed data can jeopardize the quality of the PS-BCA.  The data received may be different than what was expected.  For  example,  collecting  the  actual  incurred  cost  to  sustain  the  platform  may provide better cost visibility for estimating purposes than a negotiated contract cost, although both  may  be  referred  to  as  ‘actual  cost  data.’    Therefore,  the  analyst  may  need  to  consider additional  data  sources  if  the  data  does  not  meet  expectations.  Some  common  errors  with data include. Unexplained gaps (e.g., missing periods of time). Insufficient data points (e.g., limited use or recording of data). Limited sample size (i.e., if the data collected was based on a sample).  9.2.3.1.  However,  before  discarding  a  data  source,  the  analyst  should  confer  with stakeholders/advisors to determine if a logical explanation exists for the flaw or anomaly in the data. 9.2.3.2.  Once the data is validated by the IPT, the analyst needs to determine if the data can be used as is or if some adjustment is needed to normalize the data.  If normalization or manipulation is required, an explanation needs to be added to the documentation.  For example, contractor data may be grouped by month or quarter and then averaged, while organic data may not be modified and is collected in real-time. 9.2.3.3.  When  completing  a  PS-BCA  early  in  the  lifecycle,  specific  data  may  not  be available.  During this time in the life-cycle, it is a generally accepted practice to use data from an analogous platform. However, analogous data is often misused in the following ways. An analogy is used that is not representative of the target PSS. Assumptions are made that cannot be proven with data. 88 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Incomplete data is used that does not account for all the relevant cost associated with the COAs.  9.2.3.4.  These  missteps  are  often  the  result  of  either  not  having  better  data  on  hand  or there is a limited understanding on what the data represents.  For new platforms, early in the  life-cycle  (MS  A/B),  there  may  not  be  enough  reliable  (platform  specific)  data  to accurately model or forecast future cost, so analogous estimating is acceptable.  For new systems  with  no  clear  antecedent  platform,  the  PS-BCA  team  needs  to  have  even  more fidelity to complete a quality estimate.  New systems may need analyzing at the part level to  identify  like-and-similar  parts  which  can  be  effective  in  projecting  the  PS-BCA estimate. 9.2.3.5.  In this case, it is expected that an analogous platform would be used to gather the necessary  data  to  complete  the  PS-BCA  estimate.    However,  the  data  choices  and  how they are applied determine the quality of the estimate.  There should be a reasonable and logical correlation between the analogous system and the targeted system under study as identified  by  the  PS-BCA  team  and  associated  SMEs.  Those  systems  should  also  be documented  in  a  manner  that  demonstrates  why  the  systems  are  analogous.    It  should include  the  rationale  for  why  the  analogy  was  chosen  and  why  it  best  supports  a particular  PS-BCA  element.    It  is  also  vital  that  the  data  collected  from  the  analogous program  be complete and normalized to  a targeted metric that  will be used consistently throughout the entire analysis.  This allows for a fair comparison of data sources that can be  used  to  make  more  accurate  projections.    Here  are  some  rules  of  thumb  to  keep  in mind when using an analogy. 9.2.3.5.1.  Is the analogy being applied in a logical and sensible way? 9.2.3.5.1.1.  Effective:  Using the engine reliability data from Platform A (a turbo fan engine maintained organically), to predict the engine reliability for Platform B (which  is  also  a  turbo  fan  engine  maintained  by  a  contractor).    Both  Platforms have similar engines in size, parts, and capabilities and are overhauled at similar scheduled time intervals. 9.2.3.5.1.2.  Problematic:    Using  supply  chain  cost  data  from  Platform  A (contractor),  which  has  different  PSS  content  than  Platform  B  (contractor), because they have similar engines. 9.2.3.5.2.  What to do if an analogous platform is not available for the system under study, which is common in the Space community? 9.2.3.5.2.1.  Effective: Using an established supply chain and sustainment strategy construct  for  Platform  A  that  is  similar  to  the  targeted  supply  chain  and sustainment  strategy  for  Platform  B.  Although  the  platform  may  not  be  an analogous  hardware  solution,  a  successful  analogy  can  still  be  applied  in  other creative ways to help estimate other key elements of the PS-BCA. 9.2.3.5.2.2.  Effective: Dividing the system to the part level and then looking for existing parts that are similar while adjusting for complexity. 9.2.3.6.  This approach is only as effective as the cost and technical data collected for the programs  to  be  utilized  in  the  estimate.    Thus,  it  is  important  that  each  platform  is properly  documented  throughout  the  entire  lifecycle.    For  example,  documenting  the AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 89 growth  of  the  software  maintenance,  along  with  the  systems,  capabilities,  and  cost associated  with  the  platform  would  help  ensure  estimates  better  project  software maintenance  cost  for  the  next  generation  warfighter  or  to  satisfy  the  revalidation requirement  of  the  support  strategy  or  for  use  in  a  PS-BCA  for  a  follow-on  weapon system.  The subjective nature of analogous estimating drives risk into the estimate.  The PS-BCA team should expect to update this type of estimate with platform specific data in future PS-BCAs. 9.2.3.7.  If  the  data  requires  special  protection  (e.g.,  classified  or  proprietary),  the  PS-BCA  team  may  need  to  obtain  Non-Disclosure  Agreements  prior  to  starting  the  data collection  process.    Once  data  is  collected,  the  team  needs  to  review  the  quality  and quantity  of  the  data.    Data  that  is  not  representative  of  the  targeted  platform  has  the potential to jeopardize the quality of the PS-BCA.  The team needs to understand how the data was compiled and whether there are any known limitations. 90 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 10 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION 10.1.  Sensitivity Analysis Defined. 10.1.1.  A  sensitivity  analysis  assesses  the  extent  to  which  COA  costs  and  benefits  are sensitive to changes in GR&As and data. 10.2.  Risk and Uncertainty. 10.2.1.  Risk  and  uncertainty  cannot  be  avoided  because  the  future  is  unknown.    While  we may  have  a  belief  or  opinion  of  what  the  future  value  of  a  variable  (i.e.,  assumption,  data item)  may  be,  we  don’t  know  for  sure,  even  if  our  opinion  is  based  on  data  and  analysis.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  identify  how  “sensitive”  the  different  COAs  are  to  changes  in GR&As  and  data.    In  the  case  of  a  PS-BCA,  a  sensitivity  analysis  attempts  to  isolate  the effect  of  changing  a  variable’s  value  across  all  COAs.    Sensitivity  analyses  should  be performed  one  variable  at  a  time  to  see  which  variables  drive  large  changes  in  cost  and benefits.  While adjusting multiple variables can be done to see their combined effects, this is generally referred to as scenario analysis rather than sensitivity analysis. 10.3.  Variables. 10.3.1.  A  sensitivity  analysis  is  performed  for  each  COA  to  determine  cost  and  benefit behavior over the range of key variables’ possible values.  Some variables may be GR&As, weights, or data items. The variables chosen for sensitivity analysis are usually those that are thought  to  be  cost  drivers  and  those  whose  values  are  the  most  uncertain.  In  a  sensitivity analysis,  the  effect  of  varying  the  value  of  only  one  variable  is  analyzed  at  a  time.  A sensitivity  analysis  demonstrates  how  strong  or  robust  a  recommended  COA  is.    A recommendation is said to be strong or robust if it doesn’t change over the wide range of a variable’s possible values. A sensitivity analysis may  yield one or several cost “cross-over” or “breakeven” points, but a “breakeven analysis” is not sufficient to be called a sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis is not sufficient to quantify cost risk. 10.4.  Steps in Conducting a Sensitivity Analysis. 10.4.1.  Identify  the  Key  Variables  to  Test.    Key  variables  could  be  ground  rules, assumptions, benefits rankings/weightings, cost  drivers, risks, programmatic objectives, and raw data/scores.  It is also important to address known politically sensitive assumptions and issues. 10.4.1.1.  Rankings and weightings can be independent in a PS-BCA.  The ranking can be the order of the benefits in terms of importance, whereas the weighting can be the percent (%) weight given the benefits in relation to cost and risk. 10.4.2.  Perform  a  Sensitivity  Analysis  on  a  Selected  Variable  (Note:  this  step  should  be repeated  for  each  variable).    This  step  uses  two  approaches  and  each  approach  provides different information.  The first approach, called “graduated” sensitivity analysis, is to vary the  value  of  the  variable  and  record  the  results  (i.e.,  output)  of  the  model.    This  provides insight to the COA’s cost behavior over the broad range of a variable’s possible values.  The second  approach,  called  “break-even”  analysis,  identifies  the  point(s)  at  which  the  order  of AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 91 the COAs change.  In other words, this analysis looks at how much each variable can change before  there  is  a  change  in  the  ranking  of  COAs.    Both  approaches  are  valuable  to  the analysis and provide the MDA important information. 10.4.3.  Document the Process and the Results.  The methodology needs to be documented in enough detail to enable a reader to replicate the analysis.  The analyzed variable, the way it was varied during the analysis, and the changes to the model’s results (i.e., cost and benefits) as the value  changed should  be documented.  Document results in  the most understandable format (e.g., table, graph, bar chart, pie chart, etc.).  That is, the format in which the results are presented should clearly convey the “big picture” and the implications for costs, benefits, and risks. 10.4.4.  Repeat.  Repeat  steps  10.4.2  and  10.4.3  until  all  key  variables  identified  in  Step 10.4.1 have been tested independently. 10.4.5.  Evaluate  the  Results.    Sensitivity  analysis  provides  decision  makers  with  a  better understanding of what drives change in costs, benefits, and risks.  It can provide information that can lead to choosing a different COA from that based solely on initial results.  If minor changes  in  a  variable’s  value  change  the  recommended  COA,  the  PS-BCA  should  describe the  circumstances  under  which  the  various  COAs  would  be  recommended,  as  well  as  the recommended  alterative  under  different  objectives  (e.g.,  minimize  cost,  minimize  risk,  and maximize  benefits).    The  goal  is  to  provide  the  decision  maker  an  understanding  of  the circumstances that would lead to  the different  recommendations under the various different objectives. 10.5.  Examples for Using Sensitivity Analysis. 10.5.1.  Example 1 (Graduated Sensitivity Analysis) 10.5.1.1.  Scenario:    The  PS-BCA  IPT  is  attempting  to  address  the  risk  regarding  the programmatic  variable  of  annual  fleet  flight  hours.  The  current  planning  factors  are 10,000 hours of historical fleet flight usage. 10.5.1.2.  Issue:    A  steep  increase  in  flight  hours  will  increase  the  number  of  scheduled engine overhauls, which requires maintenance every 1,000 hours. 10.5.1.3.  Impact:  Organic only option, while previously  was the preferred option, may not  be  able  to  handle  the  anticipated  increase  in  demand  to  overhaul  engines.    $350M might be needed for additional CLS support. 10.5.1.4.  Graduated Sensitivity Analysis Technique:  What is the effect on maintenance hours/costs  if  the  flight  hours  are  increased  to  15,000  hours?    What  is  the  effect  on maintenance hours/costs if the flight hours are decreased to 8,000 hours? 10.5.2.  Example 2 (Break-Even Point Analysis). 10.5.2.1.  Scenario:    Contractor  labor  rates  are  not  yet  known  and  a  generic  contractor labor rate is used. 10.5.2.2.  Issue:  The contractor labor rate is a highly uncertain variable. 10.5.2.3.  Impact:  The PS-BCA IPT completes sensitivity analysis and discovers a 35% increase in contractor labor rates, above organic labor rates, changes COA rankings. 92 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 10.5.2.4.  Break-Even  Point  Technique:    Changing  one  variable  (in  this  case  contractor labor rates) across COAs to ascertain the effect on the COA rankings.  How much does the labor rate have to change to affect the COA rankings?  What is the impact of the other variables  as  a  result  of  this  change?    What  does  the  sensitivity  analysis  results  imply about the relative COA rankings? 10.5.3.  Sensitivity Analysis Articulation. Sensitivity analysis should explain what happens to costs and benefits if an underlying assumption changes or is wrong, or how changes in inputs (i.e.,  variable  values)  impact  the  output  (i.e.,  order  of  COAs).    Sensitivity  analysis  should identify the “what if” scenarios and the confidence range for your analysis results. 10.6.  Applying Sensitivity Analysis to Weighting and Scoring of Benefits. 10.6.1.  While  the  use  of  a  disciplined  technique  for  weighting  and  scoring  benefits  for  the PS-BCA, the process is permeated by subjectivity due to its inherent nature.  As such, the use of  sensitivity  analysis  upon  the  weighting  factors  should  be  treated  as  a  best  practice  to determine the margin of variance until the weighting of benefits warrant a different ranking of results.   Sensitivity analysis is  designed to  determine if the “solution” is  applicable over expected ranges of critical parameters.  Those critical parameters, more specifically, are the weights assigned by SMEs through the weighting and scoring process of the PS-BCA.  The ultimate  “solution”  between  multiple  COAs  that  are  very  close  in  respective  benefits  can easily be flipped if the rankings are sensitive to marginal value changes. 10.6.2.  Example.  As  a  notional  example,  assume  we  have  a  production  line  that  has quantitative  and  qualitative  benefits  of  speed  (amount  of  time  to  process  an  end  item), capacity, meantime between repairs (MTBR), ergonomics, and ability to produce. Table 10.1.  COAs and Attributes. 10.6.2.1.  Through the SME weighting process, each attribute or benefit receives a score between 0-100.  Through this process, the following raw weights are derived:  Table 10.2.  Raw Weights. 10.6.2.2.  Creating  a  total  raw  weight  score  of  300,  the  respective  weights  were  then divided by the total raw weight score (300) to develop the proportional weight.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 93 Table 10.3.  Scaled Weights 10.6.2.3.  In this specific scenario, each attribute seeks to maximize the attribute’s value (i.e.,  higher  qualitative/quantitative  values  are  better).    Thus,  the  attribute  value  is  then divided by the max attribute value.  Example is highlighted below. 10.6.2.4.  As can be seen in Table 10.4., COA 1 has the highest weighted benefit score, with COAs 4 and 2 being almost the same, but a distant second and third.  Table 10.4.  COAs, Attributes, Raw and Scaled Weights. Figure 10.1.  COAs Weighted Benefit Scores vs Their Cost.  10.6.2.5.  Once the benefits framework has been developed and a weighted score for each COA  has  been  achieved,  the  analyst  should  begin  determining  the  sensitivity  of  the weighted score. With sensitivity  analysis, we discover that  the  “solution” COA 1 (ALT 1),  is  surpassed  in  score  by  COA  4  (ALT  4)  when  the  raw  weight  for  “capacity”  is decreased from 80 to 52 (a change of 35%).  The example below highlights this change:  94 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Table 10.5.  Sensitivity Analysis Adjustment. 10.6.2.6.  The  result  of  the  sensitivity  analysis  on  Attribute  2  would  provide  a  final “solution”  of  a  weighted  score  of  .8939  for  COA  4  (ALT  4)  versus  .8925  for  COA  1 (ALT  1).    An  important  note  to  make,  however,  is  that  when  the  COAs  are  compared, COA 4 (ALT 4) is $4M less expensive than COA 1 (ALT 1).  Figure 10.2.  COAs Weighted Benefit Scores vs Their Cost after Weight Changes.  10.6.3.  Alternative Methods to Preliminary Assessment of Sensitivity. Another approach to identifying possible criterion that may be sensitive to changes in scoring/weighting is through the visual analysis of the parameters that make up each COA’s weighted score. 10.6.4.  Sensitivity Analysis  Display.  Figure  10.3 on the left  hand side shows the weighted scores of each of the four COAs.  By reviewing the chart, one will find the points scored for each  of  the  COAs  broken  out  by  the  scoring  criterion.    In  short,  one  can  visually  see  the factors that are driving the total point score.  By reviewing this chart, one can see that COA 1’s score is greatly affected by the second criteria (capacity).  It can also be quickly observed that COA 4’s score is not as sensitive to capacity as COA 1’s.  As a result, since the weight given to capacity affects the overall score each COA earns for capacity, a component of the overall weighted score, the overall weighted score might be sensitive to the weight given to capacity.    The  below  chart  on  the  right  hand  side  shows  the  result  of  applying  sensitivity analysis  by  changing  the  weighting  factor  for  capacity  from  80  to  52.  It  is  ultimately  the AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 95 analyst  and  the  PS-BCA  IPT’s  responsibility  to  determine  sensitivity  as  it  relates  to weighting and scoring of both quantitative and qualitative benefits. Figure 10.3.  Sensitivity Analysis Displays.  10.7.  Applying Sensitivity Analysis to Benefits. 10.7.1.  The purpose of sensitivity analysis is to test how robust the results are. 10.7.1.1.  Remove  one  stakeholder’s/advisor’s  vote  (or  group  of  stakeholder’s/advisor’s votes)  one  at  a  time  and  then  recalculate  the  global  weights  and  final  COA  scores  to identify a driver among the votes. 10.7.1.2.  From the recalculated results, if the order of the COAs change by removing the one stakeholder’s/advisor’s vote (or group of stakeholder’s/advisor’s votes), then further investigation should be accomplished to understand why that vote (or group of votes) is a driver. 10.7.1.3.  If  removing  stakeholder’s/advisor  vote  (or  group  of  stakeholder’s/advisor’s votes) one at  a time does not  change the order of COAs, then no one vote (or  group of votes) has an undue influence on the results in ranking the COAs. 10.8.  Shifting Attribute Scores. 10.8.1.  Shifting attribute scores between the minimum and maximum values (e.g., from 0 to 100).  The  score  for  each  major  benefit  (e.g.,  SCM,  Maintenance,  etc.)  is  shifted  from  the minimum value (0.0) to the maximum value (1.0) and the COA scores recalculated.  (Note: For scoring, the maximum value can be shown as 1.0 or as 100 points). Graph the results of 96 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 the  analysis.    The  charts  below  show  the  results  for  the  major  benefits  of  Supply  Support (SS) and SE where the maximum value is 1.0. Figure 10.4.  Global Sensitivity Analysis for Supply Support. 10.8.2.  What  is  the  likelihood  that  the  values  of  0.04  and  0.15  could  occur  in  the  data assessed?  If the likelihood is great, then the decision between COAs 7 and 4 is sensitive to the  score  used  to  assess  SS.    Also,  the  decision  between  COAs  3  and  4  is  sensitive  to  the score used for assessing SS.  Figure 10.5.  Global Sensitivity Analysis for Sustaining Engineering.  AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 97 10.8.3.  What is the likelihood that the value of 0.65 could occur in the data assessed?  If the likelihood is great, then the decision between COA 3 and COA 4 is sensitive to the data used to assess SE. 10.9.  Tipping Point. 10.9.1.  The purpose of sensitivity analysis is to determine what will happen to the expected outcome if a key variable were to change. 10.9.2.  If the sensitivity analysis does not reveal a change to the PS-BCA recommendation, then the PS-BCA IPT can be confident that the recommended COA will remain so over the broad range of values the variable could take on.  In other words, the decision maker should not be concerned over the uncertainty involved with the variable. 10.9.3.  If,  however,  the  sensitivity  analysis  indicates  the  expected  ranking  of  COAs  will change  with  relatively  small  changes  in  key  variables,  then  the  PS-BCA  recommendation would not be stable.  If the ranking of the PS-BCA COAs change as a result of changing a variable’s  value,  understanding  the  sensitivity  of  the  element  and  its  relative  importance  to the  recommended  COA  is  crucial  information  in  the  decision  support  process.    The  team would need to focus on understanding the dynamics of this particular variable to address the uncertainty in the estimate or be ready to have a detailed discussion with the decision maker as  to  the  likelihood  the  variable  will  take  on  the  values  that  lead  to  different recommendations. 98 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Chapter 11 FINDINGS, RECOMMENDATION, APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE FINAL PRODUCT SUPPORT BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS REPORT 11.1.  PS-BCA Report. 11.1.1.  This section provides guidance on initial findings, recommendation, governance and MDA approval, and implementation plan for the final PS-BCA report. Figure 11.1.

PS-BCA Findings. 11.2.1.  The PS-BCA initial findings are data driven results from the analysis.  At this point, the  PMO  understands  the  overarching  results  of  the  PS-BCA  as  well  as  performs  a  cross-check to validate the integrity and overall soundness of the PS-BCA. 11.2.2.  Findings  Summary.  At  this  stage,  costs,  benefits,  and  risks  need  to  be  evaluated together either through a MODA or WUS approach. 11.2.3.  Cross-Check.  A  cross-check  ensures  the  integrity  and  overall  soundness  of  the  PS-BCA is maintained.  Usually, after the initial findings are collected and displayed, the PMO identifies  outliers  and/or  key  drivers  in  the  analysis.    Once  outliers  and/or  key  drivers  are identified, the IPT (minus the PSPs) then determines if there are steps that need to be taken either through sensitivity analysis, additional data samples, etc. to validate the quality of the data that is causing the outlier and/or key driver. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 99  Table 11.1.

What  are  the  key  drivers  within  each  of  the  COAs  across  costs,  benefits,  and risks? 11.2.3.2.  What is the driver behind COA 2 having the highest benefit score? 11.2.3.3.  What was the quality/certainty in the data that supports that driver? 11.2.3.4.  What are key differences in costs between COA 3 and COA 1? 11.2.3.5.  Are  there  any  confidence  bounds  on  any  of  the  key  drivers?  (For  example, COA X projected to have an AO increase of 2% (+/- 1%)) 11.2.3.6.  Based  on  the  initial  findings,  are  there  areas  where  additional  sensitivity analysis is required? 11.2.3.7.  Based on the initial findings are there data procurement recommendations that would benefit the next PS-BCA? 11.2.3.8.  Are there any potential excursions that would aid the decision maker in making a decision? 11.2.4.  Cost  Model  Validation.  The  PMO  should  have  their  cost  model  validated  by  the MAJCOM  FM  and  SAF/FMC  for  ACAT  I  and  special  programs.    MAJCOM  FM  offices should review ACAT II and ACAT III programs.   The PS-BCA final report should include the documented validation. 11.3.  PM Recommendation  . 11.3.1.  The PM recommendation should take into account all of the PS-BCA findings, other business  considerations,  and  preliminary  transition  plans.    The  recommendation  should  be documented  in  the  preliminary  PS-BCA  and  include  detailed  rationale,  justification,  and supporting information to explain the COA recommendation and why the submitted COA is recommended  over  the  other  COAs.  The  preliminary  PS-BCA  should  also  summarize  the main  considerations the  PM recommendation should discuss whether this is  a final  solution, or if follow-on projects  are necessary to achieve full benefits. the  recommendation.   Finally, that  contributed to 100 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 11.3.2.

Examples  of other business considerations include: 11.3.2.1.  Loss of critical industrial capabilities 11.3.2.2.  Preservation of multiple sources of product support capabilities 11.3.2.3.  Geo-Political considerations 11.3.2.4.  Additional sensitive /classified information only known by senior leaders 11.3.2.5.  Evaluate and determine potential positive or negative impacts to 10 USC 2464 (Core workload) and 10 USC 2466 (50/50) if each COA were implemented. 11.3.2.6.  Evaluate  and  determine  potential  positive  or  negative  impacts  to  Working Capital Fund. 11.3.2.7.  If  a  specific  skill  set  is  proposed  to  be  outsourced,  is  there  a  potential  for  the government skill set to atrophy over time? 11.3.2.8.  Any  potential  obstacles  not  already  considered  that  would  impede  the implementation of the proposed COA? 11.3.2.9.  Assessment  of  potential  impacts  (positive  or  negative)  to  organizations involved in the transition, implementation and /or execution of the proposed COA. 11.3.2.10.  Other political impacts that should be considered? 11.3.2.11.  Summarize potential best practices to include any potential limitations on the Air  Force  implementing  the  best  practice  available  due  to  laws,  regulations  or  DoD policy. 11.3.3.  Funding  Impacts.  The  PS-BCA  team  should  complete  a  program  affordability analysis that compares the proposed COAs to the current program budget and considers the funding impact and “Cost to the Program”  (Note:  The Cost of the Program view should be for the total analysis period; however, comparisons to the budget for the recommended COA would  be  primarily  for  the  FYDP).  A  more  detailed  funding  plan  is  required  for  the recommended COA. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 101 Table 11.2.  Cost to the Program Output Example. 11.3.4.  Manpower Impacts. In addition to an assessment of the funding/budget, the potential manpower impact may be a factor the decision maker should consider.  While the manpower for the PMO and user should be available from the Cost Model, quantifiable impacts to WCF positions may not be easy to determine due to uncertainty of specific workloads.  However, the PS-BCA team may be able to annotate potential risks or opportunities if specific COAs are selected.  Table 11.3.  Alternative Comparisons.

Preliminary Transition  Plans. The preliminary Transition  Plan should be laid out  to show the major events/changes that are required to take place during the transition from the “as is” to a given COA.  Assess changes in work streams or “Transition events” to determine actions  required  to  implement  proposed  changes  (i.e.:    contract,  funding/budgeting, manpower,  facilities,  training,  enter  into  data  systems,  etc.).  Ensure  PS-BCA  Risk Assessment and Mitigation Plans are reflected in transition planning. 102 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 11.3.5.1.

Governance Approval. 11.4.1.  PM  Brief  to  Governance  Structure.  Through  the  governance  structure  process,  the PM should summarize the analysis methodology and approach, PS-BCA  IPT (minus  PSPs) initial findings and recommended COA with supporting justification and rationale to include other business considerations and key contributors to the PM’s recommendation.  During this time, the governance structure members should provide concurrence on 1) the PS-BCA IPT (minus PSPs) initial findings and 2) the PM’s recommendation.  If the governance structure identifies concerns with the PS-BCA IPT’s (minus PSPs) findings, the PS-BCA IPT (minus PSPs) may be directed to perform additional cross-checks to ensure their findings are sound.  If  the  governance  structure  agrees  with  the  findings  but  does  not  concur  with  the  PM’s recommendation, the governance structure members should provide their rationale to the PM and  those  concerns  should  be  taken  forward  along  with  “views  of  others”  to  the  MDA  for consideration prior to a final decision being made.

Outline for PS-BCA Final Report. The PS-BCA final report ensures the PS-BCA is fully  documented  per  project  objectives,  including  methodologies  that  are  repeatable  and traceable,  and  provides  formal  documentation  of  PS-BCA  analysis  and  findings.    The  PS-BCA  final  report  at  this  stage  should  document  the  overall  approach,  methodology  and thought process that went in to the analysis up to this point to include the initial findings and supporting cost  model. This  includes Subject  Matter Expert (SME) rationale for the benefit analysis,  weighting  and  scoring,  and  any  other  facets  of  the  analysis  where  SMEs  are utilized.  The  PS-BCA  final  report  should  be  presented  in  the  prescribed  outline  with  the appropriate  information  that  explains  in  detail  how  the  PS-BCA  was  completed,  the methodology,  define  the  COAs  and  define  the  associated  risk  and  benefits  used  throughout the PS-BCA. 104  Table 11.5.

The  development  of  the  PS-BCA  Implementation  Plan  includes  a Communications  Plan,  Project  Plan,  Budget  Plan,  Change  Management  Plan  (including Stakeholder Action Plan), and Training Plan.  Additionally, when required, AFMAN 65-510 section  2.2.18.4  provides  expectations  and  guidance  for  developing  these  plans.  The  PMO should  develop  an  executable  implementation  plan,  detailed  schedule  and  off-ramps  for implementing the approved PS-BCA COA.  The PMO should identify each task required to the  recommended  COA  only. AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 105 implement the solution and ensure a timeline/schedule for each task is developed and that a fully integrated schedule is established for full implementation of the approved COA.

Off-Ramps.  The  PMO  should  ensure  there  are  off-ramps  built  into  the  plan  in  case something  occurs  that  prohibits  execution  of  the  recommended  COA.    Off-  ramps  are decision  points  with  potential  alternate  solutions  that  can  be  implemented  if  conditions change  (for  example:  if  needed  funding  is  not  received,  what  is  the  alternate  solution?).  Status  updates,  changes  to  the  implementation  plan,  and  any  decision  not  to  continue  to 106 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 execute  approved  COA  for  any  reason  should  be  briefed  through  the  governance  structure and  ultimately  approved  by  the  MDA  to  ensure  all  parties  understand  the  changes  and concur. 11.5.  PS-BCA Approval. 11.5.1.  Approval  authority  for  the  PS-BCA  is  defined  in  AFI  63-101/20-101.    Approval authority  for  ACAT  I  and  IA  PS-BCAs  and  PS-BCA  revalidations  has  been  delegated  to SAF/AQD.    The  MDA  is  the  approval  authority  for  ACAT  II  and  III  programs.    The  PS-BCA, Final Report, and Implementation Plan should all be provided to the approval authority for review and approval. 11.5.2.  Following  the  PS-BCA  approval,  the  PM  should  update  the  LCSP  to  reflect  the recommended  product  support  strategy.    The  LCSP  should  then  be  routed  to  the  MDA  for approval, with the PS-BCA should be included as an annex.  DARLENE J.

Best Value Analysis—An analysis that considers not only cost, but other quantifiable and non-quantifiable  factors  to  support  a  decision.    This  can  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  impact  on readiness, quality and cycle time. (Source: DoDM 4151.23) Contractor Logistic Support (CLS)—A contractor, rather than the government, is responsible for  the  integration  of  logistic  support  functions such  as  providing  engineer  support,  identifying requirements for spare and repair parts, facilities, materiel, equipment, personnel and performing maintenance  on  weapon  systems.    The  Original  Equipment  Manufacturer  (OEM)  often  times provides CLS as well as can provide Product Support Integration (PSI) functions. Contractor  Support—An  overarching  term  that  applies  to  a  contractor’s  materiel  and/or maintenance support for a system. Due  Diligence—Process  of  systematically  researching  and  verifying information. the  accuracy  of Integrated  Product  Support  Elements  (IPS  Elements)—The  package  of  support  functions required  to  deploy  and  maintain  the  readiness  and  operational  capability  of  major  weapon systems,  subsystems,  and  components,  including  all  functions  related  to  weapon  systems readiness. Life  Cycle  Sustainment  Plan  (LCSP)—A  plan  describing  sustainment  influences  on  system design and the technical, business, and management activities to develop, implement, and deliver a  product  support  package  that  maintains  affordable  system  operational  effectiveness  over  the system  life  cycle  and  seeks  to  reduce  cost  without  sacrificing  necessary  levels  of  program support. (Source: DoDI 5000.02, dated January 7, 2015) AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 113 Milestone A (MS A)—Milestone A is a Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) led review at the end of the Materiel Solution Analysis (MSA) Phase.  Its purpose is to make a recommendation or seek approval to enter the Technology Maturation & Risk Reduction (TMRR) Phase. Milestone  B  (MS  B)—Milestone  B  is  a  MDA  led  review  at  the  end  of  the  TMRR  Phase.    Its purpose  is  to  make  a  recommendation  or  seek  approval  to  enter  the  Engineering  and Manufacturing  Development  (EMD)  Phase.    Milestone  B  is  considered  the  official  start  of  a program. Milestone  C  (MS  C)—The  point  at  which  a  recommendation  is  made  and  approval  sought regarding continuing an acquisition program, i.e., proceeding to the next phase. MS C approval allows entry into the Production and Deployment phase. MS C authorizes entry into  Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) (for MDAPs and major systems), into production or procurement (for non-major systems that do not require LRIP) or into limited deployment in support of operational testing  for  Major  Automated  Information  System  programs  or  software  intensive  systems  with no production components. Organic—Refers  to  U.S.  government  entities  (principally  DoD  organizations)  such  as infrastructure, personnel, equipment, and other sustainment capability to support a program. Product Support Business Case Analysis (PS-BCA)— A PS-BCA is an expanded cost/benefit analysis with the intent of determining a best value solution for product support. It assesses each COA and weighs total cost against total benefits to arrive at the optimum solution. The PS-BCA process  goes  beyond  cost/benefit  or  traditional  economic  analyses  by  documenting  how  each COA  fulfills  the  strategic  objectives  of  the  program;  how  it  complies  with  product  support performance measures; and the resulting impact on stakeholders. The PS-BCA identifies which alternative product support options provide optimum mission performance given cost and other constraints,  including  qualitative  or  subjective  factors.  The  PS-BCA  may  result  in  a recommended PSS that is hybrid blend of both PBL and transactional product support strategies broken  out  at  the  component,  sub-system  or  system  level,  along  with  a  best  value  mix  of government  and  industry  capabilities  to  deliver  the  12  IPS  elements  in  an  integrated  product support  package  at  affordable  cost.

Public—Private Partnerships (PPP) - A cooperative arrangement between an organic product support  provider  and  one  or  more  private-sector  entities  to  perform  defense-related  work, utilizing  DoD  facilities  and  equipment,  or  both.    There  are  three  basic  types  of  public-private partnership in use within the defense sustainment community: workshare, direct sale, and lease.  The bulk of the current authorities for partnerships are focused on depot maintenance.  114 AFPAM63-123  1 JUNE 2017 Attachment 2 LEGACY PROGRAM PRODUCT SUPPORT BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS SUFFICIENCY MEMORANDUM [Date]  MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD  FROM:  SUBJECT: [program name] Product Support Strategy Assessment References: (a) Title 10, United States Code, Section 2337 (b) Air Force Instruction 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management (c) Air Force Pamphlet 63-123, Product Support Business Case Analysis 1. The purpose of this memorandum is to document that the [program name] Product Support Strategy (PSS) is affordable and effective, and that changes to the product support strategy are not being considered at this time.   2. The [program name] program PSS is within expected costs and performance metrics and is achieving warfighter requirements. This determination has been validated through review of the sustainment measurements reported in the [program name] Defense Acquisition Executive Summary (DAES). The three measurements are: Materiel Availability, Materiel Reliability and Operating and Support (O&S) Costs. All three Current Estimates (CE) are better than their respective Current Baseline goals. Specifically, Material Availability CE is [xx%], well above the Baseline goal of [xx%] and the Material Reliability CE of [xx hours] far exceeds the Baseline goal of [xx hours]. Similarly, the O&S CE is [$XXB], under the Baseline goal of [$XXB] (both in BY92$).  3. [Include a brief description of any assessment of the PSS that was accomplished, if applicable].  The [program name] program office also conducted an assessment to consider whether alternative PSS might be more affordable or effective.  This assessment was completed on [DATE], and it was found that the current PSS is the best value alternative.   4.
