(T-2) 1.3.  Phases  of  Training  (Note:  All  references  to  “days”  in  this  publication  are  to  “calendar days” unless specifically noted otherwise.): 1.3.1.  Initial Qualification Training (IQT).  This training is necessary to qualify pilots for duties as first pilots (FP) in the T-6A aircraft.  See Chapter 2 for IQT program requirements. 1.3.2.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT).  This training is necessary to upgrade T-6A FPs for duties as IP in the T-6A.  In this phase, upgrades will only be accomplished with a MAJCOM-approved syllabus.  See Chapter 3 for MQT program requirements. 1.3.3.  CT.  This  training  is  necessary  for  qualified  aircrew  to  maintain  their  level  of proficiency and currency. It provides minimum ground and flight training requirements.  This training  is  also  necessary  to  develop  the  IP  force  and  certify  pilots  in  specific  unit  or  local AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 9 area  requirements.    Individual  pilot  CT  requirements  are  based  on  unit  assignment  as inexperienced or experienced.  See Chapter 4 for CT program requirements. 1.3.3.1.  Experienced  or  Inexperienced  Designation.  Squadron  commanders  will designate all pilots as experienced or inexperienced, as follows: (T-2) 1.3.3.1.1.  Experienced Pilots.  T-6A pilots who have been certified as MR and have 150  rated  hours  primary  or  instructor  flight  time  in  the  aircraft  and  600  hours  total rated time, or 250 rated hours primary or instructor flight time in the aircraft and 450 hours total rated time may be certified experienced by the squadron commander.  For the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  the  wing  commander,  vice  wing  commander,  OG commander,  deputy  OG  commander,  squadron  commander,  and  squadron  DO  are designated as experienced pilots.  (T-2)  Document experienced IP designation on the Letter of Xs (LoX) and certify via the AF Form 4348. (T-2) 1.3.3.1.2.  Inexperienced Pilots.  Pilots who do not qualify as experienced or who are not  certified  as  such  by  the  squadron  commander  are  considered  inexperienced.  Pilots  designated  as inexperienced will progress  through a program  managed by the flight  commander  to  develop  sound  flying  and  instructional  skills.  (T-2)    Flight commanders will tailor each program based on the pilot’s past flying experience and performance  during  IQT  and  MQT.  (T-2)    No  time  limit  is  established  to  transition from inexperienced to experienced. 1.3.4.  Specialized/Certification Training.  This training is necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned  missions,  but  is  not  required  of  every  crewmember.    Examples  of  specialized training  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  aircraft  handling  characteristics  (AHC)  pilot, functional  check  flight  pilot  (FCF),  etc.    Individuals  selected  for  training  will  accomplish appropriate formal course training to certify in these specialized areas, or comply with locally developed syllabi and squadron-developed training programs. 1.4.  Training Concepts and Procedures: 1.4.1.  Squadron  commanders  will  ensure  training  programs  are  designed  to  achieve  the highest  degree  of  qualification  and  proficiency  consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource availability.   (T-2) 1.4.2.  Unless  specifically  directed,  the  squadron  commander  will  determine  the  level  of supervision required to accomplish in-flight training. (T-2)  If the mission objectives include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, an IP may be required.  If mission objectives require direct supervision, a squadron supervisor may be warranted. 1.5.  Training Records and Reports.  Units will: 1.5.1.  Maintain  an  aircrew  training  folder  for  each  assigned  or  attached  aircrew  member.  The  training  folder  includes  records  of  individual  training  to  include  TI,  BIP,  specialized training,  and  certifications  and  is  maintained  according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1;  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2,  Aircrew  Standardization/Evaluation  Program;  and  the  RDS.  (T-2).    AF Form  4348s  and  any  training  not  yet  completed  are  the  only  documents  required  in  the training folder. (T-2). 1.5.1.1.  For  each  certification  listed  on  the  squadron  letter  of  Xs,  units  will  maintain documentation  on  an  AF  Form  4348  according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2.    (AF  Form 10 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 4348  is  prescribed  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume  2.  Refer  to  that  publication  for  guidance  on filling  out  the  form.)    Once  training  that  requires  a  certification  is  complete,  the  signed 4348 becomes the source document for the completion of that training.  Once the signed AF  Form  4348  is  placed  in  the  training  folder,  corresponding  training  records  may  be removed at the unit’s discretion. (T-2). 1.5.1.2.  Certification documents maintained in other locations (supervisor of flying, etc.) must also be annotated on the AF Form 4348.  (T-2) 1.5.2.  Use  AF  Form  4293,  Student  Activity  Record,  to  document  training  and  any  unusual occurrence that could affect student progress. Instructors should annotate areas of difficulty. See Attachment 2 for instructions on filling out AF Form 4293. (T-2). 1.5.3.  Document  aircrew  training  in  ARMS,  using  the  forms  specified  in  AFI  11-202, Volume 1.  (T-2) Track the following information for all aircrew, as applicable: 1.5.3.1.  Ground training dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-2) 1.5.3.2.  Flying hours by 30, 60, and 90 days, and cumulative totals. (T-2) 1.5.3.3.  Events  required,  by  total  accomplished  and  amount  remaining  for  the  training cycle. (T-2) 1.5.3.4.  Flying maneuver currency dates accomplished and expiration dates. (T-2) 1.5.4.  Units may specify additional training folder requirements. 1.6.  Pilot Utilization: 1.6.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  wing  pilots  fill  only  authorized  positions  according  to  unit manning documents and that pilot status is properly designated. (T-2)  The overall objective is for pilots to perform only operations-related duties.  Supervisors may assign pilots to valid, short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  flying  evaluation  board  member,  mishap  board  member, etc.),  but  must  continually  weigh  the  factors  involved,  such  as  level  of  pilot  tasking,  flying proficiency, currency, and experience. (T-2) 1.6.2.  Duties  required  by  various  publications  that  may  be  assigned  to  aircrew  position indicator (API)-1 pilots are programmer, flying safety officer, supervisor of flying, mobility or  contingency  plans,  training  (except  ARMS  documentation),  stan/eval  liaison  officer, squadron  aircrew  flight  equipment  training  instructor,  and  other  duties  directly  related  to flying operations.  API-1 pilots will not be attached to wing staffs or fill wing staff positions unless  total  wing  pilot  API-1/6  manning  is  100  percent  or  better.  (T-2)    Commanders  will ensure  wing  staff  pilots  (API-6)  perform  duties  justified  in  MAJCOM  manpower  standards documents and authorized in unit manning documents. (T-2) 1.7.

General Information: 3.1.1.  MQT  upgrades  T-6A  pilots  who  have  completed  IQT  to  T-6A  instructor  pilots  (IP).  MQT  is  normally  conducted  in  conjunction  with  IQT  according  to  the  formal  course  pilot instructor training (PIT) syllabus.  Additional sorties and requirements to become an MR PIT IP are at the discretion of the PIT squadron commander. 3.1.2.  Pilots who have completed MQT are basic mission capable (BMC) according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, and may not be designated as MR until completion of TI and certification by the squadron commander. (T-2) 3.1.2.1.  T-6A IPs are designated MR for the unit mission (i.e., specialized undergraduate pilot  training  [SUPT],  ENJJPT,  PIT,  or  undergraduate  combat  systems  officer  training [UCT])  upon  TI  completion  and  squadron  commander  certification.    IPs  may  only instruct formal courses for which their unit is responsible.  Exception: MR PIT IPs may conduct  SUPT,  ENJJPT,  or  UCT  syllabi  missions  in  support  of  the  re-blue  program without additional certification. (T-3) 3.1.3.  When  MQT  is  not  conducted  at  PIT,  pilots  must  complete  MQT  within  the  training time  prescribed  in  the  formal  course  syllabus.  (T-3)    The  OG  commander  or  equivalent  is waiver  authority  for  training  time  extensions.    Units  will  document  all  waivers  in  the individual’s training folder.  (T-2)  MQT is considered complete after successful completion of a mission evaluation according to AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 2. 3.2.  Prerequisite.  Pilots  must  complete  T-6A  IQT  before  beginning  MQT.  (T-2)    Before entering MQT,  each  aircrew member must comply with  prerequisites in  the appropriate formal course training syllabus and AFI 11-202, Volume 1. (T-2) 3.3.  Ground  Training.

General Information: 4.1.1.  This chapter outlines the minimum training considered necessary to maintain a viable T-6A  aircrew  corps  to  meet  mission  demands.    Judicious  scheduling  of  CT  is  required  to develop aircrew and ensure training standardization.  Sufficient flying hours are included in the  annual  FHP  to  allow  every  qualified  aircrew  member  to  accomplish  all  the  events  and currencies listed in this chapter.  Units will track all CT requirements in ARMS. (T-2) 4.1.2.  ID  sorties  are  flown  to  develop  IP  instructional  skills,  enhance  basic  flying proficiency, and help meet currency requirements.  These sorties allow inexperienced IPs to learn and refine techniques while flying with experienced IPs.  To maximize their objective, ID sorties should be scheduled and flown dual. 4.2.  Training Cycle.  There are two semiannual CT training cycles, 1 January to 30 June and 1 July to 31 December of each calendar year.  Semiannual requirements are reviewed at the end of each semiannual period. 4.3.  CT Administration: 4.3.1.  Quarterly CT Meetings: 4.3.1.1.  Squadron  commanders  will  direct  and  supervise  quarterly  CT  meetings  for aircrew  members.  (T-2)    The  purpose  of  these  meetings  is  to  discuss  standardization, safety, mission-related topics, instructional techniques, grading practices, and to increase general  knowledge.  A  CRM topic or scenario should  be discussed in  each CT meeting referring  to  core  concepts  from  AFI  11-290,  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management Training Program.  4.3.1.2.  Attendance at CT meetings is mandatory.  The unit will determine a method to track attendance as part of the go/no-go process for flight. (T-2) Individuals not available for CT meetings will read the meeting minutes or be briefed by an operations supervisor before their next flight. (T-2) 4.3.2.  Requirements.  Minimum  requirements  are  identified  in  this  chapter,  but  units  may direct  additional  training  in  a  supplement  to  this  instruction  or  as  necessary  for  individual requirements.  ID sorties are the primary means for building and maintaining instructor pilot force proficiency. 4.3.3.  Prorating  End-of-Cycle  Requirements.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  the squadron commander may prorate training requirements for aircrew members who were not available for flying duties according to AFI 11-202, Volume 1.  4.3.3.1.  Prorate only to adjust for genuine circumstances of training nonavailability, not to mask training or planning deficiencies. (T-2) 4.3.3.2.  Base prorating on consecutive days of nonflying in the training cycle and apply it  separately  for  each  period  of  nonflying.    Use  the  prorating  allowance  in  AFI  11-202, 18 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 Volume  1  to  determine  the  number  of  months  to  be  prorated  based  on  each  period  of consecutive calendar days of nonflying. (T-2) 4.3.3.3.  If  IQT  is  reaccomplished,  restart  the  individual’s  training  cycle  at  a  prorated share following IQT completion. (T-2) 4.3.3.4.  Round  off  prorated  numbers  resulting  in  fractions  of  less  than  1/2  to  the  next lower whole number, but prorate no requirement below 1. (T-2) 4.3.3.5.  For  prorating  purposes,  newly  assigned  or  converted  aircrew  and  aircrew achieving qualification after the 15th of the month are considered to be in CT on the first day  of  the  following  month.    Events  and  sorties  for  the  remainder  of  the  training  cycle may be prorated. (T-2) 4.3.4.  Failure to Complete Annual and Semiannual CT Requirements: 4.3.4.1.  Aircrew members who fail to maintain ground and flying training requirements according  to  Table  4.1.  &  Table  4.3,  and  minimum  MR  or  BAQ  CT  requirements according  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  will  be  placed  in  NMR  or  N-BAQ  status  as applicable. (T-2)  They will not fly in the new training cycle until a review is completed to determine the cause of the deficiency and whether additional training is required. (T-2) 4.3.4.2.  The OG commander (MAJCOM/A3V for MAJCOM flight examiners) is review and waiver authority for training shortfalls of  Table 4.3.  The reviewer should consider the  type  and  magnitude  of  the  deficiency  and  the  individual’s  experience  level  to determine  if  additional  training,  increased  supervision,  or  a  waiver  to  the  previous training  cycle  requirements  is  warranted.    Document  waivers,  with  justification,  in  the individual’s training folder. (T-2) 4.3.4.3.  The  OG/CC  will  document  end-of-cycle  training  shortfalls.  (T-2)    The  report will include: 4.3.4.3.1.  Number of individuals who did not complete training and reasons why. (T-2) 4.3.4.3.2.  Additional training assigned. (T-2) 4.3.4.3.3.  Number of training waivers issued with justification. (T-2) 4.3.4.3.4.  Limitations contributing to incomplete training. (T-2) 4.3.4.4.  Refer  to  AFI  11-402,  Aviation  and  Parachutist  Service,  Aeronautical  Ratings and Aviation Badges, for guidance on aviation suspension. 4.3.5.  Multiple  Qualifications.  T-6A  aircrew  members  with  multiple  qualifications  must complete all T-6A CT requirements. (T-2) 4.3.6.  Aircrew  Categories  and  Training  Requirements  .    All  aircrew  members  will maintain minimum requirements according to AFI 11-202, Volumes 1 and 2; AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 2, and this instruction. (T-1) 4.3.6.1.  IPs.  Squadron commanders may assign BMC IPs to MR status upon completion of  TI  IAW  paragraph  3.1.2.    In  addition  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  training requirements,  MR  pilots  must  accomplish  recurring  training  prescribed  in  Table  4.1, AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 19 currency  requirements  prescribed  in  Table  4.2,  and  semiannual  sortie  and  event requirements prescribed in Table 4.3. (T-2) 4.3.6.2.  FPs.  Squadron commanders may assign FPs to BAQ status upon completion of TI.    In  addition  to  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  training  requirements,  BAQ  FPs  must accomplish recurring training prescribed in Table 4.1, currency requirements prescribed in  Table  4.2,  and  semiannual  emergency  procedures  (EP)/CRM  training  prescribed  in Table 4.3. (T-2) 4.3.6.3.  Senior  Officer  FPs.  Senior  officer  pilots  maintaining  BAQ  status  will  always fly with an IP.  In addition to AFI 11-202, Volume 1, training requirements, BAQ senior officer  FPs  must  complete  recurring  training  prescribed  in  Table  4.1,  currency requirements in Table 4.2, and semiannual EP/CRM training prescribed in Table 4.3. (T-2) 4.4.  Periodic EP and CRM Simulator Training: 4.4.1.  All  pilots  will  accomplish  semiannual  EP  and  CRM  simulator  training  based  on experience  level  as  described  in  paragraph  1.3.3.1  and  as  prescribed  in  Table  4.3.  (T-2)  Accomplish the mission in the simulator with a certified civilian simulator instructor (CSI) or a qualified T-6A IP who has received training on simulator console operations.  T-6 IPs may take credit for an EP and CRM simulator when administering the simulator.   If semiannual requirements are not met, pilots will not fly until EP and CRM training is accomplished. (T-2)    Note:  PWC  requirements  may  be  met  during  EP  and  CRM  simulator  training  (see paragraph 4.9). 4.4.2.  Because  of  local  emergency  scenarios,  a  locally  generated  simulator  EP  and  CRM instructor guide will be used when administering the simulator. (T-2)  The simulator mission must include: 4.4.2.1.  All critical action procedures and selected noncritical action emergencies. (T-2) 4.4.2.2.  A  cross  section  of  thrust  deficient  situations,  to  include  at  least  one  forced landing  initiated  within  the  closed  pullup  zone.

At least one CRM practice scenario briefed, accomplished, and debriefed, using CRM core concepts from AFI 11-290. (T-2) 4.5.  Theater  Indoctrination  Training  (TI).  TI is the beginning of the local pilot certification process.  It is during TI that skills learned during IQT and MQT are reinforced in the local flying environment and tailored to the unit mission.  New pilots will fly a local familiarization mission prior to the specific TI category missions. (T-2)  This local familiarization mission will focus on local  departure,  military  operating  area,  recovery,  and  pattern  operations.  (T-2)    The  mission should  allow  new  IPs  to  absorb  as  many  of  the  local  idiosyncrasies  as  possible  before concentrating on required category missions.  The TI category missions should focus on training 20 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 techniques, local constraints, common student errors, and should use local routes and bases to the maximum extent possible. 4.5.1.  Pilots in TI will fly with assistant flight commanders and above, check pilots, or pilots certified by the squadron commander. (T-2) 4.5.2.  IPs will not perform instructor duties before completing TI. (T-2) 4.5.3.  Units  will  document  ongoing  TI  training  in  the  training  folder  (paper  or  electronic).  (T-2)    Once  TI  is  complete  and  the  individual  is  certified  on  the  Form  4348  as  a  Mission Ready IP, TI training documents may be removed from the training folder. 4.5.4.  TI sorties may meet CT requirements during the period in which they are flown.  As a minimum, fly the following missions: 4.5.4.1.  Local familiarization (must be flown first and may be flown in combination with any of the specific category missions). (T-2) 4.5.4.2.  Contact. (T-2) 4.5.4.3.  High-level navigation (should be flown as an out and back). (T-2) 4.5.4.4.  Low-level  navigation  (may  be  flown  in  conjunction  with  the  out-and-back mission). (T-2) 4.5.4.5.  Formation (if formation qualified)(T-2) 4.5.4.6.  Instrument (local area bases used for instrument training). (T-2) 4.5.4.7.  Uncontrolled  airfield  sortie.  (T-2)    As  a  minimum,  plan  the  sortie  to  overfly those  uncontrolled  airfields  that  might  be  used  as  emergency  airfields  during  the  unit’s routine  flying  operations.  (T-2)    If  possible,  fly  practice  ELPs  at  at  least  one  the  unit’s routine-use uncontrolled airfields if conditions allow (e.g., # aircraft in pattern, weather, etc). 4.5.4.8.  Operational flight trainer (OFT) simulator practicing engine failures for each of the emergency landing  pattern (ELP) series situations described in  AETCMAN 11-248, Attachment 4. (T-2)  Practice these ELPs in the OFT at the locally-assigned airfield and other  runways  likely  for  an  ELP  recovery,  to  include  commonly  used  auxiliary, uncontrolled,  or  emergency  airfields.    Additionally,  the  erect  spin  recovery  and  spiral demonstration/recovery will be flown in the OFT during this sortie IAW AETCMAN 11-248,  Attachment  4.  (T-2)    If  practical,  accomplish  this  OFT  before  the  AHC  aircraft sortie  flown  during  TI.    Civilian  simulator  instructors  or  qualified  T-6  IPs  who  have received training on simulator console operations may conduct the sim training. 4.5.4.9.  AHC  sortie,  if  not  accomplished  during  PIT  or  pilot  instructor  requalification. (T-2) 4.5.5.  When  applicable,  missions  may  be  combined  if  all  training  objectives  are  met.    TI sorties will include training in normal operations and emergency situations in the local area such  as  diversions,  single  runway  operations,  and  emergency  airfields.  (T-2)    These  items may be discussed as part of the preflight brief. 4.5.6.  Each OG commander will develop a training program to prepare aircrews to operate in an  uncontrolled  airfield  environment.  (T-2)    As  a  minimum,  the  program  will  include  a AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 21 discussion of all applicable codes of federal regulations, advisory circulars, and Aeronautical Information  Manual  (AIM)  references  on  uncontrolled  airfield  operations.  (T-2)    Training will emphasize standard civilian radio phraseology. (T-2) 4.5.7.  After successfully completing all TI  requirements, the new pilot  may  be  certified by the  squadron  commander  as  MR  by  signing  the  AF  Form  4348.    (Additional  sorties  and requirements to become an MR IP are at the discretion of the squadron commander.) 4.5.8.  Squadron commanders may tailor TI for previous MR IPs directly gained from SUPT, ENJJPT,  or  PIT  (as  PIT  instructors)  squadrons.    However,  at  a  minimum,  a  local familiarization sortie must be accomplished. (T-2) 4.5.9.  Squadron  commanders  may  tailor  TI  for  pilots  who  remain  at  the  same  base  where they completed MQT.  However, at a minimum, an ELP simulator and an AHC sortie must be  accomplished  in  accordance  with  paragraphs  4.5.4.8  and    4.5.4.9.  if  they  were  not accomplished during MQT. (T-2) 4.5.10.  Squadron  commanders  may  tailor  TI  for  FPs;  however,  at  a  minimum,  a  local familiarization sortie must be accomplished. (T-2) 4.6.  AHC Sortie Requirements and Restrictions: 4.6.1.  If not accomplished during MQT, an AHC sortie will be flown as part of TI at the new IP’s assigned base.  Each IP will receive an additional AHC sortie 10 to 18 months following MR certification.  All or part of this recurring AHC sortie may be accomplished in the T-6 OFT,  however,  priority  should  be  given  to  accomplishing  this  sortie  in  the  aircraft.  (T-2)  Any civilian simulator instructor or qualified T-6A IP who has received training on simulator console operations may administer this simulator.  Additional AHC sorties may be flown as desired by an individual IP with an AHC IP in the aircraft.  AHC training will be recorded in the IP’s training records. (T-2)  See AETCMAN 11-248, Attachment 4 for more information concerning the sortie profile. 4.6.2.  Plan to accomplish all AHC maneuvers in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) on one  sortie.    If  weather  prevents  accomplishment  of  the  high-speed  ELP  and/or  straight-in ELP during an AHC aircraft sortie, these maneuvers will be accomplished in the simulator.  Exception:  Randolph  AFB  PIT  may  accomplish  the  high-speed  ELP  in  the  T-6  OFT  for initial and recurring sorties. (T-2) 4.6.3.  AHC  maneuvers  may  only  be  flown  on  an  AHC  sortie  with  an  AHC  IP.    (T-2) Exception: Maneuvers directed by the syllabus, such as the stability demonstration and slow flight  torque  demonstration,  may  be  performed  as  directed  by  the  syllabus  or  by  any  IP during a CT sortie. 4.7.  BIP  Program:  (Note:  IPs  at  Randolph  AFB  PIT,  and  key  wing  personnel  [wing commanders,  wing  vice  commanders,  OG  commanders,  and  OG  deputy  commanders]  are exempt from this program.) 4.7.1.  Following  TI,  flight  commanders  will  assign  each  new  IP  to  a  highly  qualified  BIP who  will  monitor  the  new  IP's  performance  and  provide  guidance  in  all  areas  of  job requirements until the new IP has instructed through each category of training. (T-2) 4.7.2.  Due to different experiences of new IPs, two different BIP courses are available—long and short.  The BIP short program is for new IPs with previous instructor or extensive major 22 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 weapons system (MWS) experience.  The BIP long program  expands on  the short program and  is  mandatory  for  FAIPs  and  recommended  for  individuals  who  do  not  have  previous instructor  or  limited  MWS  experience.    The  squadron  commander  will  designate  which program new IPs will enter based on their performance during IQT, MQT, TI, and previous experience. (T-2) 4.7.3.  The  training  prescribed  in  Attachment  6  is  the  minimum  required.  Squadron commanders should tailor  each individual's  BIP  program  and provide additional training  as required. 4.7.4.  Sponsor sorties may meet CT requirements during the period in which they are flown. (T-2) 4.8.  Night Flying: 4.8.1.  Night Definition.  For purposes of CT, night is defined as the period between the end of evening civil twilight and the beginning of morning civil twilight.  To obtain night sortie credit, a portion of the sortie must be flown during this period. 4.8.2.  Night Certification: 4.8.2.1.  RCP.  Night  RCP  certification  consists  of  a  minimum  of  one  night  training sortie  in  the  RCP  with  a  night  certified  IP  in  the  front  cockpit  (FCP),  and  spatial disorientation  training  accomplished  in  a  MAJCOM  approved  spatial  disorientation training  device.    Note:  Spatial  disorientation  training  accomplished  in  conjunction  with the pilot’s most recent physiological training will satisfy this requirement. 4.8.2.1.1.  The  night  RCP  certification  sortie  will  be  a  composite  instrument  flight rules  and  visual  flight  rules  (VFR)  sortie,  emphasizing  spatial  disorientation,  night instruments,  night  VFR  considerations,  traffic  pattern  procedures,  and  visual references. (T-2) 4.8.2.1.2.  To  establish  night  RCP  landing  currency,  at  least  three  satisfactory  night RCP landings must be accomplished. (T-2) 4.8.2.2.  FCP.  Pilots  qualified  in  the  T-6A  are  qualified  to  land  in  the  FCP  at  night following  spatial  disorientation  training  accomplished  in  a  MAJCOM-approved  spatial disorientation  training  device;  no  FCP  night  certification  is  required.    Note:  Spatial disorientation  training  accomplished  in  conjunction  with  the  pilot’s  most  recent physiological training will satisfy this requirement. 4.8.2.2.1.  Without night RCP certification, pilots will not instruct, establish, or regain landing currency for an RCP pilot. (T-2) 4.8.2.2.2.  Night RCP currency is not required for a FCP pilot to instruct, establish, or regain landing currency for an RCP pilot.  For the purpose of determining crew duty day limitations, the FCP IP will consider this a “night checkout sortie” IAW AFI 11-202,  Volume  3,  General  Flight  Rules,  AETC  Supplement  if  the  pilot  in  the  RCP  is either unqualified or non-current.  Double seat swaps conducted within a single flying period  will  be  considered  one  “flight-related  activity”  for  the  purposes  of  this restriction. (T-2)  The FCP IP will not fly a “night checkout sortie” as the third flight-related activity of the duty day without a WG/CC waiver. (T-2) AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 23 4.8.3.  Night  Restrictions.  Pilots who have not accomplished spatial disorientation training IAW paragraph 4.8.2.2. will not fly at night.  (T-2) 4.8.4.  Documentation.  Night  RCP  certification  training  will  be  recorded  on  an  AF  Form 4348 in the training folder and documented on the LoX. (T-2) 4.9.  Pilot  Weather  Category  (PWC)  Certification.  (See  AFI  11-2T-6,  Volume  3,  T-6A Operations  Procedures,  for  PWC  operational  requirements  and  information.)    PWCs  are designed to reduce the exposure of pilots with limited experience to risks inherent during periods of  low  ceiling  and  visibility.    Before  PWC  1  certification,  a  pilot  will  demonstrate  instrument knowledge and proficiency to  a current PWC 1 pilot (flight commander or above) by flying an approach  in  an  aircrew  training  device  with  weather  at  or  near  PWC  1  ceiling  and  visibility minimums.  (T-2)    When  calculating  total  time  for  the  purpose  of  PWC  designation,  do  not include student, undergraduate pilot training, or “other” flight time.  (Note: Hours in an assigned aircraft  may  include  all  series  or  mission  types  of  that  aircraft.)    Squadron  commanders  will certify PWC 1 pilots. (T-2)  Record certification on an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and document  on  the  LoX.  (T-2)    Note:  For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  the  wing  commander, vice  wing  commander,  OG  commander,  deputy  OG  commander,  squadron  commander,  and squadron DO are designated as PWC 1 pilots. 4.10.  FCF  Certification.  See  Attachment  3 for FCF pilot  requirements.  Record certification on an AF Form 4348 in the training folder and document on the LoX. (T-2) 4.11.  Minimum  Training  Requirements.  Training  accomplished  during  IQT,  MQT,  TI,  and BIP  training  may  be  credited  toward  CT  requirements  for  the  training  cycle  in  which  it  was accomplished.  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  and  Table  4.1  establish  aircrew  minimum  training requirements. 4.11.1.  Flight Surgeons will complete the minimum requirements according to Table 4.1. Table 4.1.

Units will comply with grounding/frequency requirements of most restrictive guidance when differences exist between this AFI and prescribing directives. 2. n Months – Expires at the end of the last day of the nth calendar month after last accomplished.  For example, if last accomplished 10 Jan 16, expires on 31 Jan 17, overdue on 1 Feb 17.  3. See paragraph 3.8, Loss MR/BAQ Status. 4. For multiple-qualified T-6A pilots, accomplishment of annual CRM CT in their primary aircraft fulfills the T-6A annual CRM CT requirement in this table.  For flight surgeons, CRM is a one-time requirement in the primary assigned aircraft. 5. This is a one-time requirement for MAJCOM examiners who visit field units TDY.  Once accomplished on the initial TDY at each location, this training is current for the duration of the MAJCOM examiner’s headquarters tour. 6. Units required to conduct routine over-water flights will maintain water survival training (WST) currency.  An over-water flight is defined as a flight in which the aircraft is flown outside the safe glide ratio to land at any time during the flight.  Aircrew non-current in WST must accomplish WST prior to conducting over-water flight.  Ref AFI 16-1301. 7. Personnel arriving from permanent change of station (PCS) or temporary duty (TDY) during a period when water survival training is not available (i.e., winter months, pool unavailable) are automatically granted a waiver to this requirement until 60 days following the first available training date.  However, individuals will attend the academic portions of training at the earliest opportunity.  Ref AFI 16-1301. 8. All pilots on active flying status must complete the IRC every fourth quarter after completion AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 25 IAW this instruction, AFI 11-202 Vol 1, and MAJCOM guidance.  For example, if this training is completed in the first quarter of the year (Jan, Feb or Mar), it must be completed no later than the first quarter of the following year. (e.g. If completed 15 Jan 16, next IRC to be completed by 31 Mar 16). 9. Required before the first flight of the month.  An unsatisfactory boldface exam will result in grounding until successful reaccomplishment.  Ops limits exams are correctable to 100 percent. 10. Flight Surgeons only. 4.11.2.

Pilots will not fly sorties, events, mission, and currency items in which they are not qualified, current, and certified. (T-2)  FPs will not fly simulated EPs, touch-and-gos,  traffic  pattern  stalls,  power-on  stalls,  out  of  control  flight,  formation,  or  low-level without a current IP at a set of controls. (T-2)  Exception:  FPs enrolled in a formal AETC course of training (i.e., PIT), or FPs flying sorties during Wing Theater Indoctrination training (TI), are exempt from these restrictions.  In these cases, formation sorties will be  performed  under  the  direct  supervision  of  an  IP  in  the  other  formation  aircraft.  Additionally,  simulated  EPs  and  touch-and-go  landings  will  only  be  accomplished  at RSU  monitored  airfields  or  the  tower  controlled  patterns  at  Randolph  AFB  and  NAS Pensacola. (T-2) 4.12.2.  Currency and Recurrency.  Unless otherwise restricted, pilots may log and update currencies  during  any  sortie  (including  student  sorties)  if  the  maneuver  or  item  is demonstrated.  All flying currencies/events must be logged in the aircraft.  If a pilot loses an event  currency,  he  or  she  will  not  perform  that  event  except  for  the  purpose  of  regaining currency under the supervision of a current and qualified instructor. (T-2)  Unless otherwise specified,  supervisory  requirements  pertaining  to  recurrency  may  be  satisfied  in  the  flight position  that  offers  the  best  control  of  the  mission,  as  determined  by  the  squadron commander. (T-3) 4.12.2.1.  Landing  Currency.  Landing  currency,  IAW  Table  4.2,  is  required  to maintain basic aircraft qualification (BAQ).  Currency may be regained by flying at least three  satisfactory  landings  with  a  landing-current  IP.  (T-2)    A  landing  from  either  the FCP  or  RCP  updates  landing  currency.    Loss  of  landing  currency  exceeding  90  days requires the following action: (Note: Timing starts from last landing.) 4.12.2.1.1.  For  91  through  135  days.    Same  as  paragraph  4.12.2.1,  plus  an instructor-supervised  emergency  procedure  and  instrument  review  session  (normal, emergency, and instrument procedures). (T-2) 4.12.2.1.2.

RCP Landing Currency.  RCP landings update both landing and RCP landing currencies.  Currency may be regained by flying at least three satisfactory RCP landings with a landing-current IP. 28 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 4.12.2.3.  Night  RCP  Landing  Currency.  FCP  landing  currency  is  good  day  or  night.  IPs maintaining night RCP currency must accomplish a night RCP landing once every 90 days  to  maintain  currency.    To  regain  night  RCP  landing  currency,  three  night  RCP landings must be accomplished. (T-2)  The FCP IP is not required to be current in night RCP landings, but must have completed night RCP certification.  These landings must be accomplished  between  the  end  of  evening  civil  twilight  and  the  beginning  of  morning civil twilight. (T-2) 4.12.2.3.1.  IPs must be current in night RCP landings to instruct night FCP landings from the RCP. (T-2) 4.12.2.4.  ELP Currency.  IPs and BAQ FPs must accomplish an ELP IAW Table 4.2 to maintain currency.  If ELP currency is lost, pilots will not fly without an ELP current IP on board until currency is regained. (T-2)  Currency may be regained by flying an ELP from high or low key with an ELP-current IP. 4.12.2.5.  Instrument  Approach  Currency.  IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  must  accomplish  an instrument approach IAW Table 4.2 to maintain currency.  Instrument approaches will be flown from the initial approach fix (IAF), or radar vectors, to landing or missed approach and may be flown from either cockpit.  If currency is lost, regardless of the pilot’s PWC, instrument  approaches  may  not  be  flown  until  currency  is  regained  by  flying  an instrument approach with a current IP. (T-2) 4.12.2.6.  Formation  Wing  Takeoff  Currency.  IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  maintaining formation  qualification  must  accomplish  a  formation  wing  takeoff  IAW  Table  4.2  to maintain currency.  Takeoff may be performed from either the lead or wing position.  If currency is lost, formation wing takeoffs will not be accomplished without a wing takeoff current  IP  on  board;  Interval  takeoffs  may  still  be  accomplished.    To  regain  formation wing takeoff currency, a formation wing takeoff will be accomplished with a formation-current IP. (T-2) 4.12.2.7.  Formation  Wing  Landing  Currency.    IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  maintaining formation qualification must accomplish a formation landing IAW Table 4.2 to maintain currency.  Landing may be performed from either the lead or wing position.  If currency is lost, formation wing landings will not be accomplished without a wing landing current IP  on  board.    To  regain  formation  landing  currency,  a  formation  wing  landing  will  be accomplished with a formation-current IP. (T-2) 4.12.2.8.  Low-Level  Currency.  IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  maintaining  low-level  qualification must  accomplish  a  route  entry  or  exit  and  at  least  two  legs  of  a  military  training  route (MTR)  IAW  Table  4.2  to  maintain  currency.    Currency  may  be  regained  by  flying  a route entry or exit and at least two legs of a MTR with a low-level-current IP. (T-2) 4.12.2.9.  Traffic  Pattern  (TP)  Stall  Currency.  IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  must  accomplish  a full set of TP stalls (overshooting, undershooting, and landing attitude) IAW Table 4.2 to maintain currency.  If TP stall currency is lost, pilots will not fly without a current IP on board  until  currency  is  regained.    Currency  may  be  regained  by  flying  a  full  set  of  TP stalls (overshooting, undershooting, and landing attitude) with a TP stall-current IP. (T-2) 4.12.2.10.  Power-On  Stalls.  IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  must  accomplish  a  combination  of  2 power-on stalls (straight/turning/high/low)  IAW  Table  4.2 to  maintain currency.   If PO AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 29 stall  currency  is  lost,  pilots  will  not  fly  without  a  current  IP  on  board  until  currency  is regained.    Currency  may  be  regained  by  flying  a  combination  of  2  power-on  stalls (straight/turning/high/low) with a power-on stall-current IP. (T-2) (OCF)  Currency.  IPs  and  BAQ  FPs  must 4.12.2.11.  Out-of-Control  Flight accomplish an OCF recovery  IAW  Table 4.2 to maintain currency.

Events  may  be  logged  when  accomplished  on  any  sortie,  to  include  formal training syllabus missions when the instructor demonstrates the maneuver. (T-2) 4.13.1.2.  Events, when accomplished, may be dual logged.  For example, a pilot flying a complete  instrument  approach  procedure  from  the  IAF  to  a  non-precision  final  with  a circling maneuver to land may log: instrument approach, published approach procedure, non-precision approach, and circling approach. (T-2) 4.13.1.3.  Appropriate  currency  should  be  updated  when  an  event  is  flown.  (See paragraph 4.12.2.) (T-2) 4.13.1.4.  ELPs may be logged when flown from either high or low key. (T-2) 4.13.1.5.  For  the  following  events  with  more  than  one  maneuver,  log  an  event  after performing the minimum shown: 4.13.1.5.1.  For straight/turning/high/low). (T-2) power-on stalls, two stalls (a combination of 4.13.1.5.2.  For  TP  stalls,  a  full  set  (overshooting,  undershooting,  and  landing attitude). (T-2) 4.13.1.5.3.  For recoveries from abnormal flight, two of the following: nose low, nose high, and inverted. (T-2) 4.13.1.6.  For  wing  formation  takeoff  and  wing  formation  landing,  log  from  either  the lead or wing position. (T-2) 30 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 4.13.2.  Logging ID Sorties.  All IPs will fly a minimum of one ID sortie dedicated to each syllabus category of training for which they are qualified per semiannual period. (T-2)  The remaining ID sorties may be flown in any category for which they are qualified and should be tailored to developmental requirements as determined by the squadron commander.  Both IPs  may  log  ID  sorties  when  both  pilots  fly  the  minimum  maneuvers  required  by  the squadron defined profile. 4.14.  PIT Re-Blue Program. See Attachment 7.  MARK C.

AHC IP Certification.  AHC IPs will normally be FEs.  However, OG commanders may select  any  experienced  T-6A  IP  to  be  certified  as  an  AHC  IP.    Units  will  certify  the  minimum number of IPs required to fulfill AHC sortie training requirements. (T-2)  Before being certified as an AHC IP, selected IPs must complete a minimum of two AHC IP certification sorties that focus  on  instructing  the  maneuvers.  (T-2)    Training  will  be  certified  by  the  OG/CC  (or designated representative) and documented in the IP’s training record on an AF Form 4348 and tracked on the LoX (Attachment 4). (T-2) A5.1.1.  Ground  Training.  Prior  to  the  AHC  IP  certification  sorties,  upgrading  instructors will review AHC information contained in the following material: TO 1T-6A-1 (T-6A flight manual);  AFI  11-2T-6,  Volumes  1  and  3;  AETCMAN  11-248;  and  other  information  as determined locally. A5.1.2.  Flight Training: A5.1.2.1.  On the first AHC IP certification sortie, the AHC IP will brief  the sortie with emphasis  on  local  restrictions,  instructional  techniques,  and  safe  accomplishment  of  the required  maneuvers.    The  AHC  IP  will  then  fly  and  instruct  the  maneuvers.    Fuel  and time  permitting,  the  upgrading  instructor  may  fly  and  practice  instructing  any  of  the maneuvers after the initial AHC IP demonstration. (T-2) A5.1.2.2.  On the second AHC IP certification sortie, the upgrading instructor will brief, fly, and instruct all maneuvers. (T-2) A5.2.  AHC  IP  Currency.  Certified AHC  IPs  must accomplish  an  AHC sortie every 90 days. AHC  maneuvers  flown  over  2  or  3  sorties  may  be  combined  to  log  an  AHC  sortie  when  all required events are complete.  To regain currency, the AHC IP must fly an AHC profile with an AHC-current AHC IP.  (T-2)  AHC IPs who exceed 180 days from their last AHC sortie will be decertified.  To be recertified, AHC IPs will accomplish the Preflight Review IAW AETCMAN 11-248,  Attachment  4  and  fly two  AHC  sorties  with  a  qualified  AHC  IP  (one refamiliarization/training sortie and an AHC certification sortie.) (T-2)  AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 41 Attachment 6 BIP PROGRAM A6.1.  BIP Long Program.  This program should last approximately 3 to 6 months (minimum of 3  months).    New  IPs  will  accomplish  training  requirements  listed  in  paragraphs  A6.1.1  and  A6.1.2. (T-2)  Briefings accomplished during TI may be used to fulfill these requirements. (T-2) A6.1.1.

(T-2)    NOTE:  ENJJPT  IPs  who  complete  PIT  at  Sheppard  AFB  are  required  to  complete only those ground training requirements specified in paragraphs A6.1.1.1 and  A6.1.1.7. A6.1.2.  Flying  Training.  The  flying  training  portion  of  the  BIP  program  consists  of  two different kinds of sorties—BIP sorties and sponsor sorties—as follows: A6.1.2.1.  BIP Sorties.  BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the new IP.  All BIP sorties  will  be  flown  with  the  assigned  BIP,  a  flight  unit  stan/eval  monitor  (USEM),  or any supervisor (assistant flight commander or above) in the new IP’s chain of command or sister squadron leadership if approved by the new IP’s SQ/CC.  (T-2)  The objective of 42 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 these  flights  is  to  further  develop  the  new  IP’s  flying  proficiency  and  instructional techniques.    On  each  BIP  sortie,  the  BIP  will  discuss  instructional  techniques,  planning profiles, student progress, grading practices, local flying policies, common student errors, and  possible  pitfalls  the new  IP  should  avoid.    These  sorties  will  be  documented  in  the new IP’s BIP record. (T-2)  At least one BIP sortie will be flown in each of the following categories of training: A6.1.2.1.1.  Contact. (T-2) A6.1.2.1.2.  Formation (if qualified). (T-2) A6.1.2.1.3.  Instrument and navigation (may be flown as an out and back). (T-2) A6.1.2.1.4.  Low level (may be flown as one leg of the out and back). (T-2) A6.1.2.2.  Sponsor  Sorties.  The BIP, a flight USEM, or any supervisor (assistant flight commander or above) in the new IP’s chain of command will fly sponsor sorties with the new  IP’s students  to  ensure they are being taught  proper techniques. (T-2)  The new  IP will fly a series of three sorties in each category of training (two for instruments, one for low  level)  with  the  same  student,  after  which  the  BIP  will  fly  with  that  student.  (T-2)  The  BIP  will  provide  feedback  to  the  new  IP  (within  2  workdays)  on  instructional techniques  and  grading  practices.  (T-2)    Sponsor  sorties  and  debriefings  will  be documented in the new IP’s BIP training record. (T-2) A6.1.3.  Initial  Student  Sorties.  Before the new IP flies any pre-solo student sorties, he or she  will  complete  a  minimum  of  three  sorties  with  a  post-solo  student  (in  any  phase  of training). (T-2)  These sorties will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2) A6.1.4.  Student Solo.  Before the new IP solos his or her first student, someone in the BIP’s chain of command will fly one of the last four sorties before the student’s initial solo.  (This sortie will not be the last sortie before the initial solo.) (T-2)  This sortie will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2) A6.2.  BIP Short Program.  The BIP short program will last approximately 1 to 3 months and is designed  for  the  new  IP  who  has  come  from  an  MWS  with  previous  instructor  experience.  Before  accomplishing  any  student  sorties,  the  new  IP  will  obtain  a  briefing  from  the  squadron commander  on  instructor  responsibilities.  (T-2)    In  the  squadron  commander’s  absence,  the squadron DO will accomplish this briefing. (T-2) A6.2.1.  Ground Training.  New IPs will accomplish the same ground training requirements listed in the BIP long program (paragraph A6.1.1). (T-2) A6.2.2.  Flying Training.  The flying training portion of the BIP short program also consists of two different kinds of sorties—BIP sorties and sponsor sorties—as follows: A6.2.2.1.  BIP Sorties.  BIP sorties are those flown by the BIP with the new IP.  All BIP sorties  will  be  flown  with  the  assigned  BIP,  flight  USEM,  or  any  supervisor  (assistant flight  commander or above) in  the new  IP's  chain of command.   The objective of these flights is to further develop the new IP's flying proficiency and instructional techniques.  At least one BIP sortie will be flown. (T-2)  It can be in any category of training (contact, instruments,  formation,  or  navigation).    On  the  BIP  sortie,  the  BIP  will  discuss instructional  techniques,  planning  profiles,  student  progress,  grading  practices,  possible AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 43 pitfalls  the  new  IP  should  avoid,  local  flying  policies,  and  common  student  errors.  Document all sorties and debriefings in the new IP's BIP record. (T-2) A6.2.2.2.  Sponsor  Sorties.  The  BIP,  flight  USEM,  or  any  supervisor  (assistant  flight commander or above) in the new IP's chain of command (or sister squadron leadership if approved by the new IP’s SQ/CC) will fly sponsor sorties with the new  IP's students to ensure the students are being taught proper techniques. (T-2)  At least one sponsor sortie will be flown (in any category of training) after the student has had sufficient exposure to be  influenced  by  the  new  IP's  techniques.    Document  all  sorties  and  debriefings  in  the new IP's BIP record. (T-2) A6.2.3.  Initial  Student  Sorties.  Before the new IP flies any pre-solo student sorties, he or she  will  complete  a  minimum  of  three  sorties  with  a  post-solo  student  (in  any  phase  of training). (T-2)  These sorties will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2) A6.2.4.  Student Solo.  Before the new IP solos his or her first student, someone in the BIP’s chain of command (or sister squadron leadership if approved by the new IP’s SQ/CC) will fly one of the last four sorties before the student’s initial solo.  (This sortie will not be the last sortie before the initial solo.)  This sortie will be documented in the IP’s BIP record. (T-2) A6.3.  BIP  Program  Completion.  After  completion  of  all  of  the  ground  and  flying  training events, the squadron commander will certify program completion.

The purpose of the re-blue program is to increase the quality of PIT instruction  by  giving  PIT  IPs  the  opportunity  to  interact  and  fly  with  undergraduate  flying training  (UFT)  student  pilots  and  CSOs  in  all  categories  of  flying  and  ground  training instruction.    IP  re-blue  should  be  accomplished  at  the  discretion  of  the  squadron  commander after considering manning, programmed flying training, and other constraints.  PIT IPs who have not flown with a T-6A UFT student within the 2 years prior to PIT IP certification should spend a week flying with UFT students within 6 months to 1 year of receiving their IP certification at PIT.  Additionally, all PIT IPs should spend a week flying with UFT students after instructing at PIT for 3 years. A7.2.  PIT IP Responsibilities: A7.2.1.  Contact  the host squadron point of  contact  to  determine  additional requirements or documentation, if any. (T-2) A7.2.2.  Be current in all requirements and training events prior to traveling to the UFT host squadron. (T-2) A7.2.3.  Report to the host squadron DO for flight assignment. (T-2) A7.2.4.  Sample as many different categories of flying and ground training as possible while at the host squadron. (T-2) A7.2.5.  Bring  back  AFTO  Form  781,  ARMS  Aircrew/Mission  Flight  Data  Document, extracts and any documentation required to log events at the home station. (T-2) A7.3.  Host Squadron Responsibilities: A7.3.1.  Utilize the PIT IP to the maximum extent possible after consulting with the PIT IP.  The PIT IP should be treated and scheduled like any other line IP.  Schedule the PIT IP for student sorties over ID sorties to maximize training objectives. (T-2) A7.3.2.  Schedule  at  least  one  local  familiarization  sortie  to  acquaint  the  PIT  IP  with  local procedures and pattern or area references. (T-2) A7.3.3.  Attempt to fly the IP with students in all categories and varying proficiency levels so he or she can get an accurate picture of the UFT environment.  AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 45 Attachment 8 T-6 4-SHIP CERTIFICATION A8.1.  T-6  4-Ship  Basic  Wingman  Certification.  The  4-ship  upgrade  program  is  designed  to certify T-6 IPs to fly basic 3/4-ship formation for the purpose of supporting limited ceremonial missions  (e.g.,  funeral  flyovers,  etc).    Squadron  commanders  will  limit  the  number  of  IPs certified in 4-ship formation to the minimum number required to support 4-ship taskings. (T-2).  Document T-6 4-ship formation certification on the Letter of Xs and AF Form 4348.  (T-2).  The basic  4-ship  pilot  certification  focuses  on  4-ship  fundamentals  and  basic  maneuvering.  Ground/flight  training  for  the  basic  4-ship  pilot  certification  will,  at  a  minimum,  consist  of  the following: A8.1.1.  Ground  Training:    Review  AFI  11-2T-6,  Volume  3,  AETCMAN  11-248,  AFI  11-205,  Aircraft  Cockpit  and  Formation  Signals,  and  unit-specific  4-ship  SOPs  &  Briefing Guide.  Receive a briefing from a T-6 4-ship Flight Lead-certified pilot, with emphasis on 4-ship  emergencies,  takeoff  (element  &  instrument  trail),  spare  aircraft  procedures,  airborne spare,  split-up  procedures,  lost  wingman,  breakout,  rejoins,  echelon  turns,  crossunders,  and lead change. (T-2) A8.1.2.  Flying  training:  Fly  2  dedicated  4-ship  sorties.    The  upgrading  IP  may  fly  from either  front  or  rear  cockpit,  in  any  formation  position  (#1,2,3  or  4)  with  a  4-ship  qualified pilot.  Attempt to fly all 4 positions in the formation, but maximize training in the #2 and #4 positions.  Both  sorties will focus on wing work,  crossunders, pitchout/rejoins, lead change procedures, and recovery procedures.  Recover via initial, weather permitting. (T-2) A8.1.3.  Currency.    4-ship  basic  certified  IPs  will  fly  in  a  4-ship  sortie  every  180  days  to maintain  currency.  (T-2)    4-ship  basic  formation  currency  is  gained  by  performing  wing work, crossunders, pitchout/rejoins, and recovery procedures via initial (weather permitting).  If  currency  is  lost,  the  non-current  4-ship  basic  formation  IP  must  fly  and  demonstrate proficiency  with  a  current  4-ship  basic  or  lead  IP  in  the  maneuvers  described  in  this paragraph.  (T-3) A8.1.4.  Squadron commanders may tailor the 4-ship basic certification profile based on the prior  experience  level  of  the  upgradee  (e.g.,  former  fighter  or  T-38  IPs  may  only  require  1 sortie).  Squadron commanders will certify 4-ship pilots by signing the AF Form 4348 in the IP’s  training  folder.    (T-2)    Use  locally-generated  upgrade  training  documentation  to  track upgradee’s  progress.    Maintain  this  documentation  in  the  IP’s  training  folder  until certification via the AF Form 4348 is complete. (T-2) A8.2.  T-6 4-Ship Flight Lead Certification.  Squadron commanders will certify only the most highly  experienced  IPs  as  4-ship  Flight  Leads.  (T-2)    Upgrading  4-ship  flight  leads  must  be currently 4-ship basic certified. (T-2)  IPs flying in the #3 position of a 4-ship formation must be 4-ship flight lead certified.  (T-2)  Ground/flight training for the 4-Ship Flight Lead Certification will, at a minimum, consist of the following: A8.2.1.  Ground  Training:  Review/discuss  with  a  current  T-6  4-Ship  Flight  Lead:    Off-station/cross-country  4-ship  considerations,  Flyover  4-ship  considerations,  4-ship  briefing techniques,  4-ship  emergencies,  takeoff  (element  &  instrument  trail),  spare  aircraft 46 AFI11-2T-6V1  26 JUNE 2017 procedures,  airborne  spare,  split-up  procedures,  lost  wingman,  breakout,  rejoins,  echelon turns, crossunders, lead change, and recovery procedures. (T-2) A8.2.2.  Flying  Training:  Fly  2  dedicated  4-ship  sorties  as  lead  from  either  front  or  rear cockpit.  (T-2)  A maximum of 2 IPs may upgrade to flight lead within the same formation (flying as #1 and #3).  Brief & debrief at least one of the two sorties.  (T-2)  Upgrading flight lead  will  demonstrate  proficiency  in  safely  executing  a  4-ship  launch,  area  work,  and recovery.    (T-2)    Typical  upgrade  profile  should  include  element  or  interval  takeoff, departure,  area  work,  and  recovery.    Area  work  should  include  wing  work,  crossunders, echelon turns, pitchout/rejoins, and lead change(s).  Recover via initial, weather permitting. A8.2.3.  Currency.    4-ship  flight  lead  certified  IPs  will  lead  a  4-ship  formation  every  180 days  to  maintain  currency.  (T-2)    4-ship  flight  lead  formation  currency  is  gained  by performing  wing  work,  crossunders,  pitchout/rejoins,  and  recovery  procedures  via  initial (weather/traffic permitting).  If currency is lost, the non-current 4-ship lead certified IP must fly  and  demonstrate  proficiency  with  a  current  4-ship  flight  lead  IP  in  the  maneuvers described in this paragraph.  (T-3) A8.2.4.  Squadron commanders may tailor the 4-ship flight lead certification profile based on the prior 4-ship experience level of the upgradee.  Squadron commanders will certify 4-ship flight leads by signing the AF Form 4348 in the IP’s training folder.  Use locally-generated upgrade training documentation  to  track upgradee’s progress.   Maintain  this documentation in the IP’s training folder until certification via the AF Form 4348 is complete. (T-2)
