Andrews)  Pages: 51 This  instruction  implements  Air  Force  (AF)  policy  for  the  acquisition  and  management  of services  within  the  United  States  AF.  This  publication  implements  the  Federal  Acquisition Regulation  (FAR),  Defense  FAR  Supplement  (DFARS),  and  AF  FAR  Supplement  (AFFARS) and  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  5000.74,  Defense  Acquisition  of  Services.  This AF Instruction (AFI) applies to Headquarters AF (HAF), Program Executive Officers (PEOs), all Major  Commands  (MAJCOMs),  AF  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOAs),  and  Direct  Reporting Units (DRUs).  This instruction applies to the United States AF Reserve (AFR) and United States Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  who  acquire  services  through  an  AF  Contracting  Office.  Applicability  and  exceptions  to  this  AFI  are  detailed  in  section  1.2.  It  applies  to  all  activities including  Unified  and  Combatant  Commands  who  acquire  services  through  an  AF  Contracting Office (see DoD Directive 5100.03, Support of the Headquarters of Combatant and Subordinate Unified Commands) or utilize funding appropriated to the AF.  This AFI may be supplemented at the HAF, MAJCOM, PEO, FOA and DRU levels but may not be supplemented in a manner that would  restrict  the  acquisition  flexibilities  contained  within.    Route  supplements  to  this  AFI through the SSM for coordination.  Refer recommended changes and conflicts between this and other  publications  to  SSM,  112  Luke  Avenue,  Building  5683  Suite  330,  Joint  Base  Anacostia-Bolling, Washington DC 20302, on AF Form 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication. Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are maintained in accordance with (IAW) AF Manual (AFMAN) 33-3360, Management of Records, and  disposed  of  IAW  the  AF  Records  Disposition  Schedule  (RDS)  located  in  the  AF  Records Information  System  (AFRIMS).    In  accordance  with  the  services  acquisition  chain  of  authority specified in this AFI, mandates to the acquisition execution chain are not considered Wing level 2 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 mandates and therefore tiering, IAW AFI 33-360, does not apply.  However, when tiering does apply for wing/unit level requirements, waiver authority is identified with a Tier (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement.  Refer to paragraph 1.2.4 for instructions to request waivers to this AFI. Any records generated from instructions of this AFI will ultimately become  a  part  of  the  official  contract  file  that  has  an  established  disposition  schedule  and  is defined in FAR Part 4.

Purpose. 1.1.1.  The  purpose  of  this  AFI  is  to  ensure  AF  contracted  services  are  delivered  to  the warfighter  effectively,  efficiently,  and  in  a  timely  manner.    This  instruction  seeks  to encourage  a  synergistic  relationship  within  the  services  acquisition  community,  which consists  of  program  managers,  contracting  officers/specialists,  functional  representatives, financial  managers,  small  business  specialists,  requirement  owners,  and  any  other stakeholder  charged  with  any  part  of  developing,  executing,  or  monitoring  a  services requirement from identification to contract close-out.  Within this AFI, there are actions that call for crosstalk between the different disciplines to gather necessary documentation or data to  demonstrate  that  effective  governance  processes  are  in  place  to  manage  services acquisitions.  It encourages each member to reach out and gather what is necessary to deliver needed  services  to  the  warfighter  and  to  show  accountability  to  the  taxpayer.    It  provides instruction  to  mission  owners  and  acquisition  officials  charged  with  defining  and  acquiring capabilities necessary to support the warfighter.

Service  Acquisition  Executive  (SAE).  The SAE is  the senior official responsible for the management  of  acquisition  of  contract  services  on  behalf  of  the  AF.    The  SAE  is  the  Services Designated Official (SDO) with authority to assign responsibilities. 2.1.1.  SAE responsibilities are as follows: 2.1.1.1.  Assigns  responsibility  for  the  review  and  approval  of  procurements  in  each Services Category (S-CAT).  The S-CATs are based on dollar threshold and are for the purpose of establishing the level of review, decision authority, and applicable procedures in such categories. 2.1.1.2.  Provide  specific  direction,  supervision,  and  oversight  of  such  senior  leader  as assigned in 2.1.1.3.  Implement policies, procedures, and best practices guidelines. 2.1.1.4.  Execute Services Management Agreement (SMA) (as necessary). 2.1.1.5.  As SDO, the SAE holds acquisition planning and sourcing decision authority for all services acquisitions greater than or equal to the SAT. 2.1.1.6.  Ensure contract services are procured by means of procurement actions that are in the best interest of the AF. 2.2.  AF  Program  Executive  Officer  for  Combat  and  Mission Support  (AFPEO/CM).  The SAE assigns responsibility to AFPEO/CM as the AF’s SDO for the management and execution of contracted services requirements. 2.2.1.  AFPEO/CM will: 2.2.1.1.  Execute SDO authority for service acquisitions greater than or equal to the SAT but less than $1B. 2.2.1.2.  Delegate  SDO  authority  to  designated  HAF,  PEO,  MAJCOM,  and  AFFOA senior  leaders  through  this  AFI  and  as  further  detailed  to  the  specific  organization through mutually agreed SMAs. 2.2.1.3.  Review  and  coordinate  documentation  relating  to  service  acquisitions  above delegated authority, prior to submission to SAF/AQ. 2.2.1.4.  Provide executive management and oversight of all AF services acquisitions. 2.3.  Services  Designated  Official  (SDO).    The  SDO  is  the  senior  leader  responsible  for requirements development and acquisition planning for procurements in  each S-CAT identified in  Tables  2.1  and  3.1  except  for  programs  in  another  PEO’s  portfolio.    The  SDO  is  the Acquisition  Approval  Authority  that  manages  and  oversees  services  acquisitions  IAW  this  and other applicable instructions. The SDO may delegate all, some, or none  of its authorities.  The SDO retains responsibility of those services acquisitions managed through a delegated authority and  for  those  responsibilities  further  outlined  in  this  AFI  regardless  of  the  delegation.  When delegating SDO responsibilities to senior leaders, the SDO may execute a Services Management AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 9 Agreement  (SMA).    Prior  to  executing  an  SMA,  the  SDO  must  take  into  consideration  the applicable  leader’s  commitment  to  the  overall  management  and  execution  of  services acquisitions,  the  degree  of  service  acquisition  maturity,  continuous  process  improvement,  the qualifications  and  experience  to  manage  services  acquisitions,  and  the  in-place  structure  to support the management and oversight  of services acquisitions.  AF senior leaders  within each structure (MAJCOM/HAF/AFFOA  and DRUs) are responsible for initiating the discussion and the  process  for  executing  an  SMA  with  AFPEO/CM;  however,  this  authority  remains  with AFPEO/CM  until  an  SMA  is  executed.  The  senior  leaders  identified  in  Table  2.1  can  further delegate  this  authority,  but  delegation  shall  remain  consistent  with  this  instruction.    This  AFI defines the roles and responsibilities of the SDO; however, the SMA further defines and tailors responsibilities to meet the unique mission of the delegated senior leader.  If the funding agency and  the  procuring  agency  are  different,  the  management  structure  associated  with  the  funding agency  submits  the  requirement  through  an  activity  associated  with  the  management  structure, the requirement’s owner must follow the processes and procedures associated with that particular management  structure.    For  instance,  funding  that  supports  military  treatment  facilities  flows from  Defense  Health  Agency.  As  the  requirement’s  owner,  the  MTFs  within  that  MAJCOM must follow those processes and procedures established by their MAJCOM. 2.3.1.  The SDO will: 2.3.1.1.  Execute  acquisition  and  management  authorities  as  SDO,  Source  Selection Authority (SSA) (see AFFARS MP 5315.3, paragraph 1.4.1.1 for SSA appointment and delegation),  acquisition  strategy/plan  approval,  Fee  Determining  Official  (FDO)  and Term Determining Official (TDO). 2.3.1.2.  Manage  and  oversee  service  acquisitions  IAW  the  delegation  of  authority expressed  in  a  mutually  agreed  upon  SMA,  this  and  other  applicable  regulations,  and instructions. 2.3.1.3.  Approve  all  non-performance  based  Performance  Work  Statements  (PWS)  and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans (QASPs) greater than or equal to the SAT IAW the direction provided at AFFARS 5337.170-2. 2.3.1.4.  When appropriate, evaluate and  coordinate opportunities with the SSM to meet strategic sourcing objectives. 2.3.1.5.  Hold  the  rank/grade  IAW  Table  2.1.    In  special  circumstances,  the  SSM  may waive the grade requirement if the SDO is a mission owner who is knowledgeable of the service acquisition process and has direct access to GO/SES organizational leadership; or when the qualifications and experience of any proposed designee demonstrate significant experience as determined by the SSM in managing services requirements in both pre- and post-award stages and there is a structure in place to support management and oversight of services acquisition. 2.3.1.6.  Assemble  and  ensure  training  of  source  selection  teams  to  include  the  Multi-functional  Teams  (MFT)  to  manage  the  execution  of  source  selections.  Ensure  MFTs comply with the requirements identified in paragraph 2.15. Requirement owners shall be part of the MFT. Ensure the MFT is led by the Functional Service Manager (FSM) or the Program Manager (PM). 10 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 2.3.1.7.  Approve transfer of AF appropriated funds to procuring activities outside of the AF. 2.3.1.8.  Ensure  an  adequately  planned  and  resourced  management  approach  for monitoring  contractor  performance  utilizing  quality  assurance  surveillance  and  tracking procedures.    Ensure  partnerships  are  established  between  mission  owners  and  the  MFT with acquisition responsibility. 2.3.1.9.  Ensure  all  post  award  requirements  are  reviewed  no  less  than  annually  for services requirements greater than or equal to SAT for all services requirements procured either by or for the AF. 2.3.1.10.  Manage  risk  and  assess  the  progress  of  the  services  acquisition  against approved cost, schedule, and performance metrics in annual execution reviews. 2.3.1.11.  Ensure  adequate  internal  governance  policies  and  procedures  are  in  place  to measure the success of the service acquisition processes. For all programs greater than or equal to $100M, the SDO may delegate the chair of the Annual Execution Review (AER) and Health of Services (HoS) to no lower than the Services Advocate (SA). 2.3.1.12.  Develop a governance process to assess post award requirements on all services greater than or equal to the SAT.  SDOs ensure the HoS assessment considers their entire portfolio. 2.3.1.13.  In addition to the responsibilities identified in this AFI, ensure SSA adheres to all responsibilities identified in FAR 15.303(b), Department of Defense Source Selection Procedures,  paragraph  1.4.1.2  and  AFFARS  Mandatory  Procedures  5315.3  paragraph 1.4.1.2.

The name, Single Manager for Services (SMS), has changed  to  SSM.    The  change  places  the  AF  in  line  with  other  military  services  and  DoD guidance.  The SSM is chosen by the SAE and is the acquisition expert responsible for assisting with planning, strategic sourcing, execution, and management of services acquisitions.  The SSM establishes,  as  appropriate,  management  structures,  acquisition  governance,  and  processes  to ensure  effective  implementation  of  policies  for  the  AF  on  all  services  acquisitions.    The  SSM also serves as AFPEO/CM. 2.4.1.  The SSM will: 2.4.1.1.  Serve  as  principal  advisor  to  the  SAE  for  service  acquisitions,  including  any embedded services when requested by the SAE. 2.4.1.2.

Certify  that  “in-house”  DoD  resources  are  not  available  to  provide  required services. 2.9.  Program  Manager (PM) or  Functional  Services  Manager (FSM).  These roles serve as the  government’s  functional  authority  and  are  responsible  for  successful  delivery  of  the contracted  requirements.  The  PM  or  FSM  do  not  have  directive  authority  over  the  day-to-day contractor  performance.    A  contracting  officer  is  the  only  government  agent  responsible  for directing  a  contractor  to  correct  a  delivered  service;  therefore,  the  PM  or  FSM  must  work through  the  contracting  officer  (CO)  to  ensure  the  contractual  requirements,  as  defined  in  the contract  Performance  Work  Statement  (PWS),  are  met.  PM  and  FSM  has  been  defined  in  the DODI  5000.74.    The  terminology  FSM  has  been  used  historically  to  describe  the  Functional Commander. 2.9.1.  The PM and FSM will: 2.9.1.1.  Execute  management  and  oversight  for  the  delivery  of  contractually  acquired services. 2.9.1.2.  Specifically  identify  those  services  within  a  requirement  that  are  mission essential IAW DFARS 252.237-7023. 2.9.1.3.  Keep  up-to-date  on  mission  changes  that  may  drive  the  need  for  a  contract modification.    Coordinate  with  and  seek  advice  from  the  CO  on  a  possible  need  for  a modification  based  on  changes  within  the  functional  mission  that  could  affect  the performance requirements of the contract. 2.9.1.4.  Review, approve, and sign surveillance schedules prior to upcoming surveillance periods. 2.9.1.5.  When  necessary,  fulfill  contracting  officer  representative  (COR)  appointment and  supervisory  duties  identified  in  paragraph  2.10  of  this  instruction.  Review  and approve  individual’s  nomination  as  CORs  to  the  CO  to  enable  appropriate  contract surveillance. The COR(s) should be organizationally aligned with the PM/FSM whenever possible. 2.9.1.6.  No  less  than  quarterly,  review  contractor  performance  documentation  prepared by COR personnel to ensure performance is compatible with contract objectives. 2.9.1.7.  Approve Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). 2.9.1.8.  Ensure  a  Contractor  Performance  Assessment  Report  (CPAR)  is  accomplished no less than annually by either the COR or the Chief Contracting Officer Representative (C-COR). If the program is an ACAT program where services are embedded, the PM is responsible for accomplishing the CPAR. 2.9.1.9.  Ensure assessments are consistent with the monthly surveillance reports. 2.9.1.10.  Establish  a  tracking  procedures  to  ensure  MFTs  are  established  and  led  by  a PM or FSM as required in DODI 5000.74. 2.9.1.11.  Establish,  lead  and  maintain  MFT  through  the  course  of  the  acquisition  (pre and post award). AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 17 2.9.1.12.  Establish  a  governance  to  ensure  a  CPARS  Assessing  Official  (AO)  and Assessing  Official  Representative  (AOR)  is  identified.  During  the  assessment  process, provide a perception of the contractor’s overall performance. In some instances this may require the PM/FSM to be either the AO or AOR. 2.9.1.13.  Prepare slides and brief programs greater than $100M at the AER. 2.10.  Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) Supervisor:  In order to meet the intent of DoDI  5000.72,  DoD  Standard  for  Contracting  Officer’s  Representative  (COR)  Certification, DFARS PGI 201.602, and AFFARS MP5301.602-2(d). 2.10.1.  COR supervisor will: the  Contracting  Officer 2.10.1.1.  Review  and  approve  COR  nominations  via Representative  Tracking  (CORT)  Tool  (Special  Access  Programs  are  exempt  from  this requirement)  at  https://wawf.eb.mil.  In  order  to  meet  the  technical  experience requirements  of  FAR  1.602-2(d)(3)  and  DoDI  5000.72,  Enclosure  5,  paragraph  3,  COR supervisors  ensure technical,  professional,  or administrative  qualifications  within  the  area  to  be  surveilled  by  both  training  and experience commensurate with the required COR responsibilities prior to nominating an individual to the CO for COR duties. the  COR  nominee  has  relevant 2.10.1.2.  Annually  review  the  COR’s  qualifications  and  contract  surveillance  files  for accuracy and completeness. 2.10.1.3.  When  required  by  the  CO,  ensure  CORs  submit  their  OGE  Form  450 Confidential  Financial  Disclosure  Report  and  annual  training  in  a  timely  and  accurate manner. 2.10.1.4.  Evaluate the individual’s performance as a COR and solicit feedback from the CO to include in the overall evaluation.  Evaluation of CORs performance occurs if the COR is a dedicated full-time, part time or if the CORs duties are assigned as additional responsibilities. 2.10.1.5.  Functionally align CORs under the PM/FSM, when possible. 2.10.1.6.  Review problem areas identified by COR to facilitate COR/CO coordination to resolve problems. 2.10.1.7.  Review contractor performance documentation prepared by COR personnel to ensure performance is compatible with contract objectives. 2.11.  Chief, Contracting Officer’s Representative (C-COR).  A C-COR may be referred to as a  Project  Manager.    When  a  CO  determines  a  service  contract  requires  multiple  CORs  or functional subject matter experts (SME), the PM/FSM may choose to assign a C-COR as a team lead for COR surveillance activities.  If a C-COR is assigned, the C-COR incurs responsibilities identified  in  DoDI  5000.72,  DFARS  PGI  201.602  and  AFFARS  MP  5301.602-2(d).    The  C-COR can be the COR’s supervisor and in that capacity is subject to the responsibilities identified in  paragraph  2.10.  If  a  C-COR  is  not  assigned,  the  functions  called  out  in  the  subparagraphs below will be performed by the COR.  In many instances, the PM/FSM may determine assigning a C-COR does not fit their organizational structure.  The PM/FSM may nominate to the CO one COR  responsible  for  overall  surveillance  of  the  contract  with  multiple  functional  SMEs.  The SMEs  will  monitor  contractor  performance  for  their  functional  area  and  provide  monthly, 18 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 quarterly  and  annual  documentation  (as  required  in  DoDI  5000.72,  DFARS  PGI  201.602  and AFFARS MP 5301.602-2(d) and this instruction) to the COR for consolidation and submission of one report to the CO for the entire contract. 2.11.1.  The C-COR will: 2.11.1.1.  Ensure a COR file is maintained with COR records (COR qualification where applicable,  contract,  modifications,  minutes,  invoices  and  payments,  inspection  results, Quality  Assurance  Surveillance  Plan  (QASP),  Award  Fee  or  Incentive  Plan,  etc.)  and Memorandums  for  Record  (MFRs)  on  significant  issues  relating  to  the  contract  as required in DoDI 5000.72. These documents are required to be managed in the CORT. 2.11.1.2.  Inform scope/Performance Work Statement (PWS). the  CO in  writing  of  any  required  changes to the  contract 2.11.1.3.  Develop  and  publish  a  surveillance  schedule  of  COR  surveillance  activities (label as For Official Use Only) unless processes in the applicable Award Fee/Incentive Plan  delineate  specific  methods  of  surveillance  unique  to  the  acquisition.  Submit  to PM/FSM and CO for review prior to the commencement of the surveillance period. 2.11.1.4.  Develop and publish surveillance report of COR surveillance activities.  Submit to PM/FSM and CO for review. 2.11.1.5.  Draft Contract Action Reports (CARs) for submission to the PM/FSM for each area of contractual non-conformity, either immediately or at the end of each surveillance period (as determined by your Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP)) and forward to PM/FSM for review and the CO for issuance. 2.11.1.6.  Assist  PM/FSM  and  CO  in  verifying  adequate  corrective  actions  are  taken  to resolve problems. 2.11.1.7.  Notify the CO if there is high risk of the contract  costs exceeding the amount programmed (if no PM is assigned). 2.11.1.8.  Assist  CO  to  validate  the  accuracy  of  invoices  submitted  by  the  service provider prior to the government paying for services. 2.11.1.9.  Ensure a CPAR is accomplished no less than annually.  The CO may determine an out of cycle CPAR is required to address performance concerns. 2.11.1.10.  Complete all COR required training. 2.12.  Contracting  Officer  Representative  (COR).  COR  observe  and  document  the  overall performance  of  the  contractor  without  duplicating  or  augmenting  the  contractor’s  Quality Control  (QC)  function.  Specifically,  CORs  are  not  part  of  the  contractor’s  QC  function  but protect  the  government’s  interest  by  being  the  eyes  and  ears  of  the  PM/FSM  and  the  CO concerning  contractor  performance/service  delivery.    The  COR  is  not  authorized  to  further delegate  any  responsibilities  identified  in  their  COR  designation  letter.  If  a  C-COR  is  not assigned,  the  COR  will  perform  the  responsibilities  defined  in  paragraph  2.11.1  in  addition  to those listed below. 2.12.1.  The COR will: AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 19 2.12.1.1.  Provide  technical  support  to  the  PM/FSM  and  CO  and  assist  MFT  in developing performance requirements in pre-award activities when requested. 2.12.1.2.  Never  direct  contractor’s  work  or  the  re-performance  of  work,  assist  the contractor in  any task, advise the contractor on how to accomplish any task, change the contract, or interpret the contract, but rather observe and report on contractor compliance with contracted requirements. the  CO  and  MFT in  determining  Quality 2.12.1.3.  Pre-award  process:  Assist Management  System  (QMS)  requirements  being  mindful  of  the  requirements  of  FAR Parts  12,  46,  52.212-4(a),  52.246,  Chapter  6  and  the  PWS.  This  list  is  not  all encompassing  but  CORS  are  to  communicate  with  their  contracting  officers  concerning the specific FAR Parts that affect their requirement. CORs will aid in assessing contractor submitted  QMSs  for  congruence  with  predetermined  quality  system  requirements.  Any proposed  and  accepted  QMS  exceeding  the  minimum  Request  for  Proposal  (RFP) Performance  Work  Statement  (PWS)  requirements  shall  be  made  part  of  the  resultant contract/task  order  at  the  contractor’s  proposed  rate,  in  a  way  that  does  not  reveal  the contractor’s proprietary information. 2.12.1.4.  Post-award process: Ensure contractor’s accepted QMS complies with contract requirements.  In  post  award,  CORs  need  to  place  special  emphasis  in  ensuring  the contractor’s  QMS  is  being  followed  as  written,  plus  is  effective  in  bringing  about  the desired results – performance equal to or greater than the SS metrics, plus an inspection and  corrective  action  program  that  identifies  and  fixes  issues  without  having  to  be identified by the Government. 2.12.1.5.  Assist  the  MFT  in  developing  a  QASP  or  Award  Fee/Incentive  Plan,  as applicable, prior to source selection that effectively measures and evaluates performance-based activity throughout the life of the functional contract requirement. CORs ensure the QASP is updated to ensure it reflects any contract changes. 2.12.1.6.  Promptly report performance issues to the CO in writing. 2.12.1.7.

Complete all COR required training. 2.12.1.9.  If  functional  SMEs  are  utilized,  develop  a  plan  to  collect  surveillance documentation from all SMEs for consolidation into a single monthly surveillance report. 2.12.1.10.  If  a  SME  identifies  an  area  of  concern  regarding  the  conformance  of  the contractor’s  performance,  verify  the  SMEs  concerns  and  document  any  contractor  non-conformance of the contract requirements. 2.13.  Contracting Officer (CO).  Oversee the day-to-day administration of the contract.  Enter into,  modify,  interpret,  take  corrective  actions,  and  terminate  a  contract  on  behalf  of  the government  as  specified  on  the  CO  warrant.    Ensure  a  contractor's  performance  satisfactorily meets  contractually  agreed  upon  standards  as  stated  in  the  PWS.    The  Federal  Acquisition Regulation and its supplements dictate the responsibilities of the CO. 20 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 2.14.  Quality  Assurance  Program  Coordinator  (QAPC).  The  QAPC,  in  coordination  with the technical/functional activity, will assist the MFT in developing clearly stated and enforceable contract quality requirements. The QAPC also assists the MFT in integrating the quality contract requirements  into  the  QASP  or  Award  Fee/Incentive  Plan  as  applicable  and  acts  as  the  liaison between the Contracting Office and functional organizations.  Refer to DoDI 5000.72, AFFARS MP 5301.602-2(d), 5346.103, for QAPC responsibilities. 2.15.  Multi-Functional  Team  (MFT).

The emphasis  of the MFT  is  on teamwork, trust, common sense, and agility. Membership may be tailored to fit the size and complexities of the acquisition  and  may  include  members  such  as  the  CO,  PM/FSM,  COR,  Small  Business  (SB) professionals,  etc.  (as  determined  by  the  SDO  or  delegated  authority).    This  list  is  not  all inclusive and some of the members listed here may be unnecessary for your acquisition. 2.15.1.  The MFT will: 2.15.1.1.  Foster partnerships with industry to ensure exchanges of information among the service  industry  partners  and  other  business  experts  occur.  Ensure  the  key  stakeholders participate in developing, implementing and executing the acquisition strategy. 2.15.1.2.  Provide  support  to  senior  leadership  as  required  (i.e.,  performance  metrics, data,  and  briefings).  Ensure  correspondence  and  presentations  are  accurate  and  timely. Provide reports that provide early warnings of significant variances in cost, schedule, or contractor substandard performance to senior leadership. 2.15.1.3.  Research  the  commercial  market  to  ensure  use  of  the  most  efficient  and effective assessment methods, techniques, and best commercial practices in performance of the contract, especially with regard to contractor QMS. 2.15.1.4.  Develop, implement, and execute a performance-based acquisition strategy that meets the needs of the applicable functional activity, to include performance metrics that result  in  a  higher  level  of  contractor  performance,  fostering  synergistic  partnerships, accommodating  changes  or  unforeseen  mission  needs,  and  leveraging  commercial  best practices. Ensure the acquisition strategy aligns with the mission performance needs and that  the  PWS  and  acquisition  approach  are  designed  to  deliver  the  desired  mission support results. 2.15.1.5.  Manage  risk  to  ensure  mission  performance  is  within  cost  and  schedule constraints. 2.15.1.6.

Develop  a  QASP  that  assesses  a  contractor’s  complete  performance  with  an emphasis on assessing the viability of the contractor’s accepted QMS.  On a case-by-case basis, the Chief of the Contracting Office may approve the use of an Award Fee/Incentive AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 21 Plan (as applicable) in lieu of a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) for service acquisitions  greater  than  or  equal  to  $100M.  The  plan  must  provide  for  comparable surveillance of services. For items not suitable for inclusion in the award fee or incentive plan, a limited plan may be developed. The Award Fee/Incentive Plan should be tailored to  the  acquisition  and  include  all  criteria  for  monthly  monitoring,  evaluating,  and reporting to the MFT, Requirement Owner, PM, and CO. 2.15.1.9.  Assess  and manage  contractor performance data, to include submitting CPAR reports. 2.15.1.10.  Assist  the  mission  owner  in  developing  a  well-defined  contract  requirement, development  of  acquisition  and  source  selection  strategy,  and  assessing  risk  in determining performance criteria. 22 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF SERVICES ACQUISITIONS GOVERNANCE Chapter 3 the the  AF:  Headquarters  AF three  management  structures  within 3.1.  Support Services Requirements Review (SSRR).  The SSRR is a tiered approach used to assess (HAF), MAJCOM/DRUs/AFFOA  and  WS  PEOs.    This  review  consists  of  a  requirements  review  and governance  assessment.    Tier  one  (requirements  review)  identifies,  assesses,  validates,  and approves  services  support  requirements  at  an  identified  senior  level.    Tier  two  (governance assessment) starts with conducting an AER for each individual acquisition and is combined with a self-assessment of the structure’s health in establishing, implementing, and executing processes for  the  management  of  services  acquisitions.  Tier  two  is  also  referred  to  as  the  Services Governance Health Assessment (SGHA).  The combination of these tiers leads to an overall AF enterprise  assessment  that  looks  into  the  following  disciplines:  requirements  generation, acquisition planning/resourcing strategy, and performance management. 3.2.  Requirements  Approval  Authority  (RAA).  Following  preliminary  market  research,  the acquisition team formulates a solution for the mission requirement.  When the analysis leads to a solution to contract for services, the organization’s senior official approves the requirement via a Requirements  Approval  Document  (RAD),  prior  to  approval  of  the  acquisition  strategy.    The Acquisition  Strategy  Panel  (ASP)  Chair  may  grant  a  waiver  to  extend  the  RAD  approval timeline.  However, the RAD must be approved prior to release of the solicitation.  Additionally, document  the  extenuating  circumstances  that  require  the  late  approval  of  the  RAD  prior  to  the ASP or in the ASP briefing slides or minutes. 3.2.1.  RADs shall be consistent with the scope and complexity of the services requirements.  The requiring activity shall provide (at a minimum) the following: 3.2.1.1.  An explanation of the mission. 3.2.1.2.  The need for the requirement and the outcomes to be achieved. 3.2.1.3.  A description of how the requirement was previously satisfied and what changed in the environment to require the need for the proposed solution. 3.2.1.4.  An explanation for the need to contract out instead of satisfying the requirement organically. 3.2.1.5.  The nature and extent of any market research conducted up to this infancy stage, to include any applicable benefit analysis performed for bundling and/or consolidation. 3.2.1.6.  The impact to the mission if the RAD is not approved. 3.2.2.  Requirements  authority  approval  for  embedded  services  captured  within  program  of record  milestone  decision  documents  is  the  MDA.    Clearly  written  services  requirements vetted  by  the  appropriate  stakeholders  early  in  the  life  cycle,  and  then  documented  at  AF Review Board, or included in the Acquisition Strategy (AS) or Life Cycle Sustainment Plan (LCSP) would serve as requirements approval for services.  For those services not included in  the  original  documentation,  an  amendment  to  the  milestone  documentation  or  a  separate RAD is required.  AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 23 3.3.  Requirements Approval Applicability. 3.3.1.  RADs  are  mandatory  for  all  services  acquisitions  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  SAT utilizing funds appropriated to the AF to include acquisitions acquired by and/or for the AF. A  validating  process  of  requirements  below  $10M  is  mandatory;  however,  the  form  and formatting  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  RAA.    The  RAA  needs  to  show  the  existence  of  a requirements review process. 3.3.2.  An amended RAD is mandatory for any proposed action that results in an increase of 25  percent  (cumulative)  or  greater  of  the  previously  approved  total  estimated  services requirements  value.    This  would  include  any  one  time  change  of  25  percent  or  multiple smaller changes that when added together changes the value of by 25 percent or greater.  If your  requirement  is  a mix of products  and services, the amended RAD is required only for the  services  portion  of  the  requirement.    Attach  the  amended  RAD  and  an  explanation  of each change to the original RAD. Ensure the amended RAD is approved by the original RAA unless  the  change  pushes  the  approval  level  to  new  dollar  delegation.    The  amended  RAD must be approved by the original RAA unless the new total  value exceeds his/her approval authority.    If  the  new  total  value  exceeds  the  original  RAA’s  authority,  route  the  amended RAD  (attaching  the  original  RAD)  through  the  original  RAA  for  coordination  to  the  new approval authority for approval. (IAW Table 3.1). 3.3.3.  Any  proposed  modification  and/or  task  order  that  would  result  in  work  that  was  not validated  and  approved  in  the  existing  requirement  approval  documentation  shall  be validated and approved by the RAA for the new total services acquisition value.  This should be  based  on  the  amount  of  the  action  plus  the  amount  of  the  original  awarded  contract,  in conjunction with a Justification & Approval (J&A) if out of scope/new work but not for in-scope change (routed concurrently with the J&A if the RAA is different  or not in the same routing chain as the J&A process). 3.4.  Applicable to HAF Structure. 3.4.1.  Brief  HAF  requirements  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  SAT  (Operations  and Maintenance (O&M) and investment appropriations) annually to the Services Review Group (SRG) (chaired by AF/CVA, SAF/AA, and SAF/MG). 3.4.2.  HAF  requirements  greater  than  or  equal  to  the  SAT  but  less  than  $10M  will  be approved by HAF 2-ltr Principal/Deputy (delegable to 3-ltr GO or SES). 3.4.3.  HAF  requirements  greater  than  or  equal  to  $10M  but  less  than  $100M  will  be approved by the SAF/MG (delegable to no lower than 3-ltr Principal or Deputy). 3.4.4.  HAF requirements greater than or equal to $100M will be approved by the SAF/MG. 3.4.5.  Each  dollar  threshold  requires  a  disciplined  requirements  approval  process  that documents the organization’s need. 3.5.  Applicable  to  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA  Structures.  The  SSRR  process  realigns accountability and responsibility of the services requirement within the functional chain.  Ensure requirements  at  each  dollar  threshold  have  a  requirement  approval  process  that  documents  the need.  These  processes  are  defined  by  the  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA;  however,  all  requirements greater than or equal to $10M require an approved RAD signed by the approval official for the delegated dollar threshold as stated in Table 3.1. 24 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 3.5.1.  The  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA  CC/CV/CA  approves  all  services  requirements  within its  delegated  authority  as  outlined  in  Table  3.1.    The  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA  CC/CV/CA ensures  the  approved  requirements  greater  than  $100M  are  forwarded  to  the  SSM immediately  after  approval.  The  SSM  may  share  the  approved  RADs  with  the  appropriate HAF functional 2-ltr, the SAE, and others as appropriate. 3.6.  Applicable  to  WS  PEO.  The  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  for  Acquisition (SAF/AQ) remains at the top of this governance structure and has the authority to adapt/modify the processes for effectiveness and efficiency.  SAF/AQ is designated the Services Advocate for the WS PEOs services acquisition structure.  An overarching Services Management Agreement (SMA)  with  SAF/AQ  documents  and  flows  the  following  processes  down  to  the  WS  PEOs.  RADs  for  embedded  services  do  not  include  the  dollar  value  for  the  products  portion  of  the requirement.    RADs  are  approved  by  the  WS  PEO  based  on  the  below  dollar  values  and  are further outlined in Table 3.1: 3.6.1.  For  services  requirements  below  $10M,  the  PEO/Deputy  is  the  default  approval authority;  however,  this  authority  cannot  be  delegated  below  an  O-6  or  equivalent  civilian.  The authority is not further delegable. 3.6.2.  Services  requirements  greater  than  or  equal  to  $10M  but  less  than  $100M  require documentation  via  a  RAD  and  approval  from  the  PEO  (delegable).    The  authority  is  not further delegable 3.6.3.  Service  requirements  greater  than  or  equal  to  $100M  require  documentation  via  a RAD  and  approval  by  SAF/AQ.    WS  PEOs  forward  a  copy  of  all  approved  services requirements, greater than or equal to $100M to the SSM. 3.7.  Process (All Structures). 3.7.1.  The  requiring  activity  documents  the  need  for  the  proposed  requirement  and  obtains requirements  approval  from  the  appropriate  RAA  (identified  in  Table  3.1)  as  soon  as  new requirements,  follow-on  requirements  or  changes  to  recurring  requirements  are  identified.  An  approved  RAD  would  accompany  the  requirement  if  the  requirement  is  executed  by another entity regardless if the executing entity is AF or an outside agency. 3.7.1.1.  If there are multiple requiring activities, execute a Memorandum  of Agreement (MOA)  under  HAF/PEO/MAJCOM/DRU  guidance  identifying  the  lead  activity  and,  if appropriate, the lead organization for execution of the acquisition. 3.7.1.2.  If the requirement or the services element of the requirement is estimated to total $100M or more, staff the MOA through the SSM. 3.7.1.3.  When the funding agency and the procuring agency are different, the procuring agency obtains a copy of a signed host tenant agreement or MOA signed by the RAA for the dollar threshold associated with the requirement.   At a minimum, the agreement must acknowledge  an  awareness  of  the  requirement  and  that  the  procuring  agency  has  a willingness  and  adequate  personnel  to  support  procurement  of  the  requirement.    For example,  if  the  Army  funds  a  requirement  that  directly  supports  their  mission  and  has sent a funding document of $25M to XYZ AFB to procure the services, the AF must have a  letter  signed  by  the  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA  CC/CV/CA  or  delegated  authority acknowledging both a willingness and adequate personnel to support the requirement. AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 25 3.7.1.4.  If  the  funding  agency  and  the  procuring  agency  are  different  but  the  funding agency  submits  the  requirement  through  an  activity  associated  with  the  management structure, the requirement’s owner must  follow the processes  and procedures associated with  that  particular  management  structure.    For  instance,  funding  that  supports  military treatment facilities flows from Defense Health Agency. As the requirement’s owner, the MTFs within that MAJCOM must follow those processes and procedures established by their MAJCOM. 3.7.2.  Each  structure  submits  a  quarterly  report  of  services  requirements  approved  during that quarter with an estimated value of $10M or greater to the SSM not later than (NLT) the fifth business day of the new quarter (i.e. reports are due the fifth business day of April, July, October  and  January  for  the  preceding  quarter).    Submit  reports  to  the  AFPEO/CM Workflow  box  via  e-mail.    The  SSM  provides  a  quarterly  report  of  approved  service requirements  with  an  estimated  annual  value  of  $10M  or  more  to  SAF/AQ.    SAF/AQ  will forward the quarterly reports as follows: 3.7.2.1.  “Operational  Services  Requirements”  to  the  VCSAF  for  dissemination  to COCOMs,  providing  them  awareness  of  future  operational  capabilities.    Operational services  requirements  are  those  services  directly  supporting  a  COCOM’s  war-fighting mission. 3.7.2.2.  “Services  Support  Requirements”  to  the  SecAF,  providing  awareness  of  future support capabilities.  Support service requirements are all services other than operational requirements. 3.7.3.  When USD(AT&L) has identified a requirement as a special interest item (see Table 3.1), prepare a RAD  and any other requested documentation in  coordination with  PEO/CM for  approval.    Submit  your  package  through  PEO/CM  prior  to  issuance  of  the  solicitation. Within 10 business days after receipt of the notification, USD(AT&L) or designee may direct a  review  of  the  proposed  requirement  to  be  accomplished  within  30  days  calendar  days  of such direction.  Issues arising from the review shall be resolved IAW procedures specified by USD(AT&L)  or  designee,  in  direct  coordination  with  SAF/AQ  through  the  SSM.  If USD(AT&L)  does  not  notify  the  SSM  or  requiring  organization  focal  point  within  the  10 business  days of the status of the RAD (approved, disapproved or additional direction), the acquisition may proceed.

RAD format is at the discretion of the RAA for all dollar values.  All requirements estimated at greater than $10M require an approved RAD signed by the RAA indicated by dollar threshold in the above table (or as delegated). A validating process of requirements below $10M is mandatory; however, the form and formatting is at the discretion of the RAA.  The RAA needs to show the existence of a requirements review process. 2.  Quarterly reports are mandatory on all requirements greater than or equal to $10M.  Accomplish manual submissions until the implementation of the Services Management Tool (3.7.2).   3.  Requirements that have been approved by a Milestone Decision Authority (MDA) for an ACAT or MAIS program of record captured within the program milestone decision documents serve as the requirements approval for embedded services. No further approval for those embedded services is needed by SAF/AQ. (see 3.1.2.2). 4.  MAJCOM CCs can delegate authority to a Numbered AF CC or Center CC who is a direct reporting organization within its Command.  Numbered AF CC or Center CC may re-delegate the authority to no lower than the CV or CA.  5.  Authority for services embedded in supply or weapon system’s contracts is determined by the S-CAT threshold corresponding to the total cost/price of the embedded service (does not include the supply or products portion of the requirement).   6.  HAF Structure:  S-CAT IV and S-CAT V delegable to no lower than 3-Ltr Principal or Deputy. 7.  PEO Structure:  S-CAT IV delegable to no lower than GO/SES/Deputy PEO.  S-CAT V delegation to no lower than an O-6/GS-15 (or equivalent). 8.  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA Structure:  S-CAT IV to no lower than O-6/GS-15 (or equivalent) and S-CAT V to no lower than O-5/GS-14 (or equivalent).   9.  For an AF Commodity Council acquisition with a HAF 2-ltr Commodity Sourcing Official (CSO), approval of the Commodity Sourcing Strategy (CSS) constitutes requirements approval. 10. Delegations to AFFOA are not automatic but are at the discretion of their parent organization.     AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 27 3.8.  Acquisition Planning/Sourcing. 3.8.1.  Pre-Award.  The success of contracted services depends largely on the preparation and planning conducted prior to solicitation and award. 3.8.1.1.  Early Strategy and Issues Session (ESIS). The purpose of an ESIS is to simplify an Acquisition Strategy Panel (ASP) and to mitigate re-work.  An ESIS is mandatory for all services acquisitions greater than or equal to $100M and is recommended for services acquisitions  below  $100M.    It  is  most  effective  when  conducted  as  an  informal,  open discussion between the acquisition team, their chain of command, SSA, SDO, and/or SA.  It  is  a  synergistic  approach  to  sharing  top  level  ideas  and  best  practices  prior  to  the formation  of  the  formal  acquisition  strategy.  If  market  research  leads  the  team  in  a direction  that  is  more  advantageous  for  the  acquisition,  the  team  should  discuss  the change during the Acquisition  Strategy briefing.   The team  should schedule an ESIS  as early as possible after some preliminary market research.  Optimally, plan to conduct an ESIS  at  least  120  calendar  days  prior  to  the  ASP.    The  ESIS  is  intended  to  facilitate dialogue from the first day of ESIS through meeting the Acquisition Strategy Panel brief however,  an  ESIS  it  is  not  meant  to  establish  an  acquisition  strategy  or  to  solicit  a decision. time 3.8.1.2.  Acquisition  Planning.  Acquisition  teams  monitor  active  contracts  to  allow sufficient to  plan  re-procurements  and  develop  clear,  performance-based requirements.    Ensure  all  requirements  include  identifiable  and  measurable  cost, schedule,  and  performance  outcomes.  Ensure  a  service  acquisition  strategy  develops requirements  that  align  and  track  mission  objectives  complemented  by  a  contract methodology that optimizes and drives performance. If the strategy is a non-performance based  requirement,  the  team  must  obtain  approval  from  the  SDO.    Ensure  the  selected contract incentives  align  with performance  requirements  and  objectives  to  achieve  mission  success.  All  requirements must  be  reviewed  and  coordinated  by  the  installation/servicing  Manpower  Office  in accordance with AFI 38-201 prior to approval of the acquisition strategy. type,  source  selection  procedures,  and  contract 3.8.1.3.  Market  Research.    Each  acquisition  team  should  place  optimal  attention  on market  research  throughout  all  phases  of  the  acquisition  cycle  (pre-  and  post-award). Changes  in  the  political  and  non-political  environments  can  have  major  impacts  to  the success of the acquisitions; therefore the team should exercise vigilance in ever-changing market  dynamics.    It  begins  immediately  upon  identification  of  a  requirement  and continues  after  a  contract  is  awarded.  All  services  acquisitions  require  market  research that  demonstrates  agency  reliance  on  the  commercial  marketplace  for  its  capabilities, innovation,  technologies,  and  competitive  forces.    Equally  important,  market  research identifies capable small businesses to determine the level of small business participation as  either  a  prime  or  sub-contractor.    Market  research  is  essential  to  the  government’s ability to buy best-value services that deliver mission-critical results. 3.8.1.3.1.  Acquisition approaches that maximize competition shall be the norm, and organizations shall make every effort to  achieve  the maximum  competition for both current and future requirements.  Market research should be the guide in constructing the best acquisition strategy that meets the needs of the government. 28 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 3.8.1.3.2.  Contract  type  and  oversight  is  critical  to  the  sustainability  of  a  program.  Address deviations from recommended business practices in the acquisition plans. 3.8.1.3.3.  Detail the nature and extent of market research conducted, to include data analysis  of  the  Small  Business  market  capabilities;  and  to  include  any  applicable benefit analysis performed for bundling and/or consolidation and the impact on Small Businesses. 3.8.1.4.  Performance Work Statement (PWS).  A PWS defines the requirement in terms of results rather than the method of performing the work. The requiring activity develops the  PWS  jointly  with  the  other  members  of  the  MFT.    Cite  reference  directives  (e.g. publications,  instructions)  by  specific  process  or  procedure  (e.g.  paragraph  or  chapter) rather  than  the  entire  publication  in  the  PWS.  Additionally,  the  PWS  should  be  written clear enough for the contractor to adequately assess the government’s need to sufficiently allocate the right workforce mix to support the requirement; however, ensure the PWS is written  as  performance  based  unless  approved  by  the  PM/FSM  to  solicit  a  non-performance based acquisition. 3.8.2.  Post-Award. 3.8.2.1.  Services  Governance  Health  Assessment  (SGHA).    The  SGHA  is  the  Annual Execution  Review  (AER)  and  the  Health  of  Services  (HoS)  combined.    The  PM  or  the requirement’s owner is responsible for the preparation and briefing of the AERs.  SGHA starts  with  the  PMs  or  requirement/functional  owner  presenting  an  AER  for  each individual  acquisition.    The  management  structure  (HAF/MAJCOM/PEO)  presents  an assessment  of  his/her  HoS.    The  combination  of  each  management  structure’s  overall assessment will lead to an overall AF enterprise assessment that looks into the following disciplines:  requirements  generation,  acquisition  planning/resourcing  strategy,  and performance management. 3.8.2.1.1.  Each  structure  is  governed  by  a  senior  leader  responsible  for  services oversight across that structure (e.g. HAF, MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA, and WS PEO). 3.8.2.1.2.  Internally,  evaluate  the  execution  of  services  acquisitions  within  their organization  and  assess  the  health  of  their  operations  for  the  past  FY  using  the existing AFPEO/CM AER and HoS templates for requirements greater than $100M, which are distributed to all structures by PEO/CM not later than the following June of the reporting period. 3.8.2.1.2.1.  For  acquisitions  less  than  $100M,  each  structure  may  use  its discretion  for  template  form  and  format,  but  is  encouraged  to  refer  to  the templates  located  at  the  above  link  for  guidance.  Ensure  the  results  of  each structure’s AER and HoS is rolled-up and accounted for in the structure’s overall assessment. 3.8.2.1.3.  MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA/PEO  senior  leaders  submit  completed  AER  and HoS  charts  to  PEO/CM  not  later  than  or  the  last  workday  of  December  (using  a Monday – Friday work week) that covers the preceding FY.  (E.g., MAJCOM charts are due 31 Dec 2016 for its FY 16 post award review).  MAJCOM CC or the SA with PEO/CM  receive  presentations  from  the  MAJCOMs  of  the  AERs  and  the  HoS beginning January of the next calendar year (as scheduled).  Although not required, a AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 29 senior  leader  may  request  to  present  their  SGHA  prior  to  January.  All  briefings should  conclude  no  later  than  15  Mar.    PEOs  will  present  their  review  and assessments  to  SAF/AQ  (PEO/CM  may  attend  presentations  as  an  advisor  to SAF/AQ) beginning as early as January but should conclude no later than 15 Mar. 3.8.2.1.4.  HAF  will  receive  presentations  for  all  reviews  and  assessments  no  later than 15 Mar. 3.8.2.1.5.  AF  structure  (SAF/AQ,  SAF/MG,  and  PEO/CM)  leads  must  create  and summarize  an  integrated  assessment  for  their  AF  structures  of  programs  within  its portfolio. The integrated assessments are then provided to the Services Review Group (SRG)  tri-  chaired  panel,  which  consists  of  principals  from  SAF/AA,  AF/CVA, SAF/MG  and  supported  by  advisors  from  SAF/FM,  SAF/AQ  and  AFPEO/CM  not later than 31 Mar. 3.8.2.1.6.  The  SRG  reviews  the  information  to  identify  AF-wide  synergies, efficiencies and strategic opportunities and presents their recommendations to the AF Council, chaired by USecAF and VCSAF during the 2nd quarter of the calendar year.  This is an integrated assessment from the HAF, MAJCOM/DRU/AFFOA and PEOs and  is  in  a  forum  to  identify  lessons  learned  and  best  practices  that  have  AF-wide applicability. 3.8.2.2.  Applicable  to  HAF  Structure:  SAF/MG  is  the  designated  HAF  SA  and  is responsible for the 2-ltr requirements approval greater than $10M and HAF’s SGHA. 3.8.2.2.1.  The  HAF  Services  Advocate  generates  an  assessment  of  the  performance of  services  governance  structure  for  the  HAF  (self-assessment).  This  enables  a meaningful  corporate  assessment  of  the  overall  health  of  the  AF  with  respect  to contracted  services  when  combined  with  the  MAJCOM/DRU  and  WS  PEO assessments. 3.8.2.2.2.  The  SGHA  documentation  for  the  HAF  will  be  governed  by  templates tailored  each  year  to  identify  key  areas  of  interest;  however,  documentation  may include the following: 3.8.2.2.2.1.  An overview of the 2-ltr’s internal governance process. 3.8.2.2.2.2.  The HoS Stoplight Chart – Annual Performance Self-Assessment. 3.8.2.2.2.3.  Any  Results,  Strategic  Opportunities,  Best  Practices,  and  Lessons Learned. 3.8.2.2.2.4.  A Program List. 3.8.2.2.2.5.  All  acquisitions  greater  than  $10M  for  higher  level  review  and assessment purposes. 3.8.2.2.2.6.  Summary of requirements (by execution category as applicable). 3.8.2.2.2.7.  Identification  of  effort  category.  [i.e.,  Mission  Critical  (necessary  to support your mission), Mission Enhancing (important, but does not stop mission) and/or  politically  critical  (sensitive  to  Congress  or  the  public  and/or  possess  a potential media interest) acquisitions]. 30 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 3.8.2.2.2.8.

Ensuring  the  quality  of  services  acquisitions  via  a  contractor  quality  system and/or  an  inspection  system  resulting  in  a  QMS  as  identified  in  FAR  46.105(a)(1),  46.202-4, 52.246-X, is the responsibility of the service contractor, not the government.  The government’s role  is  to  ensure  it  receives  the  services  contracted  and  only  pays  for  the  services  actually received. The quality of embedded services in ACAT programs is evaluated in accordance with the  quality  measures  in  place  for  those  contracts.    The  contractor's  proposed  QMS  may  be evaluated as part of the source selection process. 6.2.  Functions  of  a  QMS.  In  order  to  meet  the  government’s  quality  requirements,  a contractor’s QMS should be robust enough and resourced adequately to execute four key quality functions: 1) Detection of quality program problems and defects; 2) Identification of root causes for  quality  related  problems/defects;  3)  Correction  of  root  causes  related  to  detected problems/defects;  and,  4)  Follow-up  to  ensure  quality  related  problems/defects  do  not  recur. Furthermore, a mature QMS requires the contractor be the proactive party on quality issues (see Figure  6.1).  The  goal  is  to  obtain  performance  reflective  of  continuous  improvement  with  no reliance  on  COR’s  surveillance  to  detect  problems/defects,  determine  root  causes,  or  ensure quality related problems/defects do not recur. Figure 6.1.  The Four Functions of a Quality Management System.  6.3.  Government  Responsibilities in  Quality  Management  Oversight.  The  primary responsibility of CORs in assessing a contractor’s QMS is to inform the PM/FSM and CO if the contractor’s accepted QMS does not sufficiently control quality as required by FAR 46.105, fails to meet the PWS quality requirements or departs from the contractor’s QMS. Consider any COR detected problems/defects not identified by the contractor’s QMS as the most egregious violation of quality systems failure. Subsequently, PM/FSMs and COs are responsible for addressing QMS non-conformities  IAW  paragraph  6.4  of  this  instruction.    Sections  801  and  802  of  the  FY02 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) mandate Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA)  goals,  cost  savings,  and  a  management/oversight  structure  for  service  acquisitions similar to the procurement of products.  To this end, effective PBSA methods require the most useful  insight  and  oversight  strategies  available  to  the  government.  Contracts  that  use Award/Incentive  Fee  Plan  also  use  Performance  Management  Strategies  to  supplement  the AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 35 Award/Incentive  Fee  criteria  (i.e.,  methods  of  surveillance,  etc.)  delineated  in  the  applicable Award/Incentive Fee Plan. 6.4.  Quality Related Contract Oversight Responsibilities (Key Stakeholders).  When developing quality related contract oversight responsibilities, the MFT ensures Services Summary (SS) items directly align with applicable CPARS evaluation areas. In turn, the PWS builds upon the SS items with QASP surveillance scheduling and reporting focusing on the SS items to ensure proper alignment with applicable CPAR evaluation areas. When developing the QASP, the MFT ensures inclusion of key aspects of the contractor’s accepted QMS, as well as FAR, DFARS, and AFFARS quality related requirements, this instruction, and published functional community requirements. Service Summaries should address the desired quality of service by identifying acceptable service standards/metrics, and not merely reiterate the PWS requirement. The SS is tailored to the requirement and how it shall contribute to the overall mission. The MFT also identifies how CORs are to assess non-SS items as well as the Performance Based Payment (PBP) if applicable. See Figure 6.2. 6.5.  Multi-Functional  Team  (MFT).  The  MFT’s  responsibility  for  government  quality management oversight extends from the pre-award to the post-award phases (to include contract close-out) of contract management. 6.6.  Pre-Award. 6.6.1.  Overview.  During  the  pre-award  contracting  phase,  MFTs  are  responsible  for considering  the  quality  requirements  of  the  functional/technical  activity,  SS  development, performance plan development and the possible inclusion of PBPs. As part of the pre-award process, the MFT ensures SS performance objectives are measurable, surveil-able, and align with  applicable  CPARS  reporting  categories  as  illustrated  in  Figure  6.2.    The  MFT  also ensures  QASP  surveillance  of  SS  performance  objectives  are  scheduled  and  reported  in  a manner that integrate into a PBP plan (if used) and CPARS reporting. developing contract to 6.6.2.  Quality  Requirements.  Prior the functional/technical  member(s)  of  the  MFT  identify  the  quality  requirements  essential  for successful  mission  performance  of  services.  The  Contracting  Office,  in  turn,  ensures  the functional/technical  quality  requirements  are  incorporated  into  the  request  for  proposal  and the contract. As part of reviewing quality requirements the MFT, using FAR 46.201, 46.202, and 46.203 criteria, determines if standard or higher-quality level inspection requirements are applicable  for  the  performance  of  contract  services  and  are  appropriate  for  the  type  of contract (Type A, B, or C) being awarded according to MP5301.602-2(d). requirements 6.6.2.1.  For  contracts  requiring  standard  quality  requirements,  the  MFT  ensures  that service specifications are included in solicitations and the contract requires the contractor to provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the government meeting the functional/technical  activity’s  quality  requirements.    Standard  quality  requirements  may require inclusion of either FAR 52.246-4 or 52.246.5 clauses (FAR 46.202-3). 6.6.2.2.  Ensure  contracts  requiring  higher-level  contract  quality  requirements  include  a SS performance objective that encompasses MFT goals related to quality directly relating to  the  CPARS  category  of  “Quality.”    The  MFT  also  ensures  the  QASP  adequately addresses  surveillance  of  contractor  QMS  related  responsibilities  that  integrate  the functional/technical activity’s quality requirements. Contracts with a higher-level quality 36 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 requirement  may  require  inclusion  of  either  FAR  52.246-4  or  52.246-5  and  52.246-11 clauses (FAR 46.202-4). 6.6.2.3.  For  commercial  services  contracts  awarded  under  FAR  12.208,  the  MFT identifies if the government, upon consultation with the functional/technical activity, has a  need  to  conduct  in-process  inspections.    If  so,  the  MFT  in  coordination  with  the functional/technical  activity  determines  which  commercial  quality  practices  meet  the government’s quality requirements. 6.6.3.  Service Summary (SS) Development.  The MFT will ensure mission essential/critical items are included in the SS table with measurable and surveil-able performance thresholds.  The MFT also considers the type, surveillance frequency, and quantity of each performance objective  when  considering  the  performance  threshold.    For  example,  a  SS  performance objective with a performance threshold of ninety-nine percent requires one hundred percent COR  surveillances  to  adequately  assess  contractor  performance.  In  some  instances  a performance  objective  warrants  a  ninety-nine  percent  performance  threshold;  however,  a corresponding level of COR surveillance is necessary in order to assess the service provided. 6.6.4.  QASP  Development.  The  SS  is  releasable  to  the  contractor  but  the  QASP  is  an internal  Government  document.    After  establishing  mission  essential/crucial  SS  items  with measurable  and  surveil-able  performance  thresholds,  the  MFT  ensures  the  QASP  builds  a surveillance  plan  that  schedules  surveillance  of  all  SS  and  non-SS  items.    Furthermore,  the QASP identifies how CORs  link surveillance of SS items to  monthly/quarterly surveillance reporting and CPARs  reporting. A viable QASP also  meets  the QASP related requirements found  in  FAR  Parts  37  and  46,  DFARS  237.172  and  246.401,  PGI  222,  PGI  237,  MP 5301.602-2(d)  and  5346.103,  AFI  38-203,  and  any  applicable  functional  community guidance (e.g. AFI 21-101 for aircraft maintenance community).  The use of an Award Fee Plan or an Incentive Plan (as applicable) may be used in lieu of a QASP for large acquisitions greater than $100M and identifies: 6.6.4.1.  Objective(s)  in  having  the  services  provided  and  the  desired  results  the  MFT hopes to achieve with the acquisition. 6.6.4.2.  Roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  MFT  members  responsible  for  post-award management. 6.6.4.3.  A  strategy,  methods  and  tools  the  MFT  will  use  to  assess  the  contractor’s performance  against  the  performance  thresholds,  measurements,  metrics  and  incentives identified in the contract.  Performance thresholds must be measurable in terms of quality and timeliness of performance. 6.6.4.4.  A  management  approach,  methods  and  tools  the  MFT  will  routinely  use  to validate the objectives and goals identified as part of the performance plan. 6.6.4.5.  An incentive plan may be the management approach, methods and tools used to validate the objective and goals of the MFT. 6.6.5.  Performance  Based  Payment.    The  MFT  considers  the  applicability  of  a  PBP  plan IAW FAR 32.1001 with concurrence from the PM/FSM and CO. 6.6.6.  Quality Control.  Contractors are responsible for submitting a complete QMS plan that is  reviewed  for  acceptance  by  the  government.  The  QMS  includes  a  quality  control  plan AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 37 (QCP) addressing the “detection” function that defines the type, number, Acceptable Quality Levels  (AQLs),  and  frequency  of  quality  assurance/control  inspections  planned  by  the contractor  that  meet  the  intent  of  the  applicable  FAR  52.246  or  FAR  52.212-4(a)  clauses. Prior  to  the  pre-performance  meeting,  the  MFT  requires  the  winning  contractor  to  fully address any deficiencies identified in the QMS. 6.7.  Post Award. 6.7.1.  Contract Oversight and Administration.  After contract award, the MFT ensures COR oversight focuses on the adequacy  and  adherence of the  contractor to their proposed QMS.  The MFT pays special attention to: 6.7.1.1.  Whether the COR or contractor is first in detecting defects and trends, 6.7.1.2.  Who (COR or contractor) accomplishes more inspections, and, 6.7.1.3.  Whether  the  contractor  is  proactively  pursuing  the  four  key  QMS  functions  of detection of quality program problems and defects, identification of root causes, quality related  problems/defects,  correction  of to  detected  and problem/defects, and follow-up to ensure quality related problems/defects do not recur. root  causes related 6.7.2.  Contracting Officer for Contracted Functions. As part of the CO led training identified in  AFFARS  MP  5301.602-2(d),  the  CO  tailors  COR  training  on  the  proper  submission  of surveillance  documentation  and  contractor  accepted  QMS  requirements.  The  CO  is responsible  for  ensuring  COR  surveillance  inspections  are  accomplished  as  required  by  the QASP. 6.7.3.  QAPC.    For  contracts  requiring  higher-level  quality  requirements,  the  QAPC  assists the MFT in developing metrics, tracking the effectiveness of the contractors QMS that tie to the SS, QASP, and CPARS.  In addition to the MP 5301.602-2(d) requirements, the QAPC trains FSM and CORs on the concepts and applicability of service contract QMSs, tailoring training  to  the  specific  contract.  Per  AFFARS  MP  5346.103-1c  the  QAPC  assists the  MFT during  the  acquisition  process  to  develop  clearly  stated,  enforceable  contract  quality assurance requirements and assists during market research.   Examples of suggested metrics are found in the below sub-paragraphs: 6.7.3.1.  COR-QA Defect Detection Ratio. The COR-QA defect detection ratio measures the  “detection”  element  of  a  QMS  by  comparing  the  number  of  COR  inspections  and corresponding defects to contractor quality inspections and identified defects.  The results of COR and contractor inspections in  the surveillance period (monthly or quarterly) are then converted to  a ratio.  For example, if CORs accomplished 206 inspections with 78 defects, the defect detection ratio would be 38 percent (78 / 206 = .3786 or 38 percent). If a contractor accomplishes 401 quality inspections with 155 defects, the defect detection ratio would be 39 percent (see Figure 6.3).  The point of the COR defect detection ratio is to ensure the contractor is accomplishing more inspections with at least the same level of defects.    In the previous COR and contractor examples, the contractor is  accomplishing more  inspections  and  identifying  more  defects  than  the  CORs,  which  is  the  desired outcome. 38 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 Figure 6.2.  COR-QA Defect Detection Ratio.  6.7.3.2.  Contractor  QA  Detection  Capability  Ratio.    The  contractor  QA  detection capability  ratio  metric  measures  the  “detection”  element  of  a  QMS  by  determining  if  a contractor’s  quality  inspectors  are  competent  in  detecting  and  documenting  defects.  As with  the  COR-QA  defect  detection  ratio,  the  number  of  defects  of  the  COR  and contractor are used to calculate defect detection ratios; however, COR and contractor QA defects are compared to  each other. For example, if the COR scheduled 20 of their 206 inspections  to  observe  contractor  quality  inspectors  accomplish  inspections,  with  the quality  inspectors  detecting  32  defects  and  the  CORs  detecting  34  defects  this  would mean  that  contractor  quality  inspectors  detected  94  percent  (32  /  34  =  .9411  or  94 percent) of the total defects (see Figure 6.4). The desired outcome of this metric would be for contractor quality inspectors to the same or more defects than the COR. Figure 6.3.  Contractor QA Detection Capability Ratio. 6.7.3.3.  COR-QA  First  Time  Defect  Detection  Ratio.  The  COR-QA  First  Time  Defect Detection  Ratio  is  the  “identification”  element  of  a  QMS  to  determine  who  typically finds  and  documents  a  contractual  non-conformity,  the  CORs  or  contractor’s  quality system.    Specifically,  if  CORs  document  a  CAR  before  the  contractor  self-identifies  a contractual  non-conformity,  the  contractor’s  QMS  is  determined  to  not  meet  contract standards. For example, between the CORs  and the contractor’s quality inspectors there were  five  CARs  written,  however  the  CORs  wrote  one  CAR  the  contractor’s  quality inspectors did not identify a CAR.  In this example, the CORs first found 20 percent of the contractual nonconformities.  AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 39 Figure 6.4.  COR-QA 1st Time Defect Detection Ratio. 6.7.3.4.  Defect  Correction  Rate.    The  defect  correction  rate  measures  the  “correction” and  “follow-up”  functions  of  a  QMS  by  determining  if  the  contractor  is  implementing proper and timely corrective actions. Specifically, the defect  correction rate identifies if COR/contractor  identified  nonconformities  are  corrected  within  the  contractor’s  self-imposed “get-well” dates.  For example, if in a year the contractor has 13 scheduled “get-well” suspenses for contractual non-conformities within a quarter and 11 suspenses were met, the defect correction rate is 84 percent (11 / 13 = .846 or 85 percent). Note: CORs may need to schedule surveillance to validate the defect is corrected.  Figure 6.5.  Defect Correction Rate. 6.7.4.  Program  Manager  or  Functional  Services  Manager.    In  addition  to  the  PM/FSM’s overall responsibility of ensuring contracted services adequately support the mission of their organization’s  mission,  the  PM/FSM  via  the  CORs  will  ensure  the  adequacy  of  the contractor’s  QMS.  The  PM/FSM  will  make  certain  that  the  contractor’s  QMS  effectively accomplishes the detection, identification, correction, and follow-up functions.  Furthermore, the  PM/FSM  will  ensure  CORs  do  not  become  the  contractor’s  quality  control/quality assurance  (QC/QA)  function.  The  role  of  the  FC  and  FD  (DFARS  237  and  AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5301.602-2) serve the same role, purpose and intent of the Functional Services Manager (FSM) as identified in DODI 5000.74.  40 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 6.7.5.  C-COR and CORs. As part of the surveillance process, CORs never direct contractor work  or  the  re-accomplishment  of  work,  assist  the  contractor  in  any  task,  advise  the contractor  on  how  to  accomplish  any  task,  change  the  contract,  or  formally  interpret  the contract.  CORs  place  special  emphasis  on  the  comprehensiveness  and  adequacy  of  the contractor’s QMS to ensure adherence to FAR 46.202-3 Standard Inspection Requirements, the applicable Inspection of Services clauses in FAR 52.246, 52.212-4(a) and the contractor’s QMS. 6.7.6.  Multi-functional Team Post Award Lines of Communication.  As illustrated in Figure 6.2, members of the MFT after contract award should ensure the only formal or directive line of communication between the government and the contractor is from the CO. However, all other  members  of  the  MFT  can  communicate  informally  with  the  contractor.  Examples  of informal  communication  are  clarification  of  delivery  schedules  or  communication  of  COR inspection results. Note that even though the PM/FSM retain responsibility for the success or failure of the contracted function, they do not have directive, corrective, or legal enforcement authority over the contractor. These authorities are reserved for the CO. 6.8.  Types of COR Oversight. 6.8.1.  Overview. Even though COR oversight is not a form of contract QC/QA, according to the Inspection of Services clauses for services (FAR 52-246-4 or -5), the government has the right to inspect and test all services (both SS and non-SS services) called for by the contract to  the  extent  practicable  at  all  times  and  places  during  the  term  of  the  contract.    However, government  surveillance  should  be  done  in  a  manner  that  does  not  unduly  delay  the contractor’s  accomplishment  of  services.  Striking  the  balance  in  assessing  contractor accomplished  services  without  delaying  accomplishment  of  those  services  requires  an understanding  of  when  to  use  available  COR  surveillance  methods  to  include  one-hundred percent inspection, periodic surveillance, customer complaint, or audit reviews. 6.8.1.1.  One-Hundred  Percent  Inspection.  This  surveillance  method  is  preferred  for contractor  services  that  do  not  occur  frequently,  are  critical,  and/or  have  stringent performance  requirements.  When  using  this  surveillance  method,  CORs  inspect  and evaluate the contractor’s performance every time they accomplish the service. 6.8.1.2.  Customer  Complaints.    The  customer  complaint  method  of  surveillance  is  the most inexpensive means of contractor surveillance. However, the validity of the customer complaint  method  of  surveillance  may  be  questionable  due to  customers  not understanding  the  PWS  requirements.    The  value  of  customer  complaint  surveillance  is its  ability  to  further  validate  contractor  performance  of  services  if  other  surveillance methods  indicate  unsatisfactory  performance  of  service  exists.    CORs  should  consider that  the  existence  of  such  complaints  does  not  necessarily  indicate  a  service  is nonconforming but may indicate a personality conflict or other non-contractual issue. 6.8.1.2.1.  CORs  using  the  customer  complaint  method  of  surveillance,  provide customer  training  to  each  organization  receiving  contractor  services.  Customer training  covers  those  services  relevant  to  the  customer,  contract  performance thresholds for those services, and actions customers may expect from the COR and/or CO  for  nonconforming  services.  Also,  CORs  should  advise  customers  to  avoid unauthorized commitments and directing the contractor’s work.  AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 41 6.8.1.2.2. If the PM/FSM, with input from the MFT determines the use of the customer complaint method of surveillance is appropriate, use the SAF/AQCP Customer Complaint Record template https://cs1.eis.af.mil/sites/afcc/knowledge_center/templates/customer_complaint_record.pdf or a locally devised form to record the complaint. Ensure the validation process includes a reasonable attempt to contact the complainant and verify the service received was substandard. 6.8.1.2.3.  The COR must be cautious when using the customer complaint method of surveillance  as  he/she  could  inadvertently  be  delegating  contract  surveillance responsibilities  to  the  customer.  While  customer  feedback/complaint  can  be  an important  aspect  of  an  effective  surveillance  program,  it  should  not  be  the  sole surveillance method used to monitor compliance with contract terms and conditions. 6.8.1.3.  Review of Audits. The audit review method of surveillance typically centers on a  contractor’s  QMS  corporate  and/or  local  audits.  In  the  audit  review  method  of surveillance, CORs, as part of their monthly/quarterly surveillance, review results of the contractor’s  accepted  QMS  audits  and  related  quality  metrics.    For  example,  if  a contractor  QMS  requires  an  annual  corporate  quality  audit  each  July,  local  quarterly audits,  and/or  monthly  supervisory  audits,  CORs  schedule  surveillance  to  capture  these audits during the applicable surveillance period. 6.8.1.4.  Periodic  Surveillance.    This  periodic  method  of  surveillance  consists  of  COR surveillance  of  services  selected  on  other  than  the  one  hundred  percent  inspection, customer complaint, or review of audits methods of surveillance.  An example of periodic surveillance is a COR selecting the time of surveillance for a contractor provided service as it becomes available.  Furthermore, the periodic method of surveillance allows CORs flexibility in meeting monthly/quarterly surveillance schedule requirements and provides CORs  the  ability  to  target  known  problem  areas.    However,  CORs  using  periodic surveillance  should  ensure  all  PWS  services,  SS  and  non-SS  items,  are  sufficiently sampled to validate contractor conformity. 6.8.1.4.1.  Monthly/quarterly scheduling of COR periodic surveillance require CORs to  plan  a  specific  number  of  surveillances  for  each  service  during  a  scheduled surveillance  period  rather  than  scheduling  a  specific  date  and  time  of  surveillance.  Periodic  surveillance  can  be  accomplished  concurrently  while  the  contractor  is performing a service or after a service is completed. 6.8.1.4.2.  With  contracts  requiring  higher-level  quality  requirements,  it  is  critical  to assess key contractor processes rather than just completed services. When scheduling periodic  surveillance  CORs  should  ensure  a  sufficient  number  of  “in-process” periodic  inspections  are  scheduled  during  each  surveillance  period  where  CORs  are observing  services  as  they  are  performed.    For  contracts  containing  standard inspection  requirements  as  identified  in  FAR  46.202-3,  surveillance  of  “completed” services is preferable IAW PBSA principles. 6.8.2.  Scheduling and Reporting COR Surveillance. 6.8.2.1.  Determining  COR  Surveillance  Schedule.    Depending  upon  the  PWS  service requirements,  the  MFT  determines  if  an  overall  monthly  or  quarterly  surveillance  is 42 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 warranted.    For  contracts  with  higher-level  quality  requirements  and/or  numerous  SS items,  MFTs  should  strongly  consider  a  monthly  surveillance  schedule.    However,  SS thresholds and surveillance sample size may determine the inspection cycle for  each SS item.  For example, if a SS performance objective’s performance threshold is 95 percent, which requires a minimum of 20 COR surveillances, and the SS performance objective is a  service  accomplished  ten  times  a  month,  then  a  quarterly  surveillance  cycle  is suggested.  In order to determine the overall COR surveillance schedule, if more than half of  the  SS  items  require  a  monthly  surveillance  cycle,  then  contract  surveillance  should require CORs to build a monthly surveillance schedule that would include quarterly cycle SS items evenly divided in each of the next three month surveillance schedules.  For FAR Part  12  commercial  services  contracts,  and/or  contracts  with  a  standard  inspection  of services clause, and/or SS items, a quarterly inspection schedule may be warranted. 6.8.2.1.1.  Prior  to  executing  a  monthly/quarterly  surveillance  schedule,  CORs coordinate the schedule through the PM/FSM and CO NLT than the duty day before the  schedule  surveillance  period  begins.   Document  the  PM/FSM  and  CO coordination. Mark surveillance schedules “For Official Use Only.” 6.8.2.2.  Surveillance of Non-SS items.  The inspection schedule shall be comprised of at least  ten  percent  of  non-SS  items,  but  no more  than  twenty  percent.    Monthly  schedule format is determined by the COR, PM/FSM, and CO. 6.8.2.3.  Surveillance  Reporting.    Based  upon  the  surveillance  schedule,  CORs  will coordinate  and  submit  a  monthly  or  quarterly  surveillance  report  of  all  scheduled surveillance through the PM or FSM and submit to the CO NLT the 5th work day of the month  following  the  scheduled  surveillance.    Monthly/quarterly  surveillance  report format  is  determined  by  the  COR,  PM/FSM,  and  CO.    Document  PM/FSM  and  CO coordination. 6.8.2.3.1.  Document  each  scheduled  COR  inspection  on  a  locally  devised  COR surveillance  form.  After  completing  surveillance,  CORs  request  a  contractor representative to initial the completed form in order to ensure the contractor is aware the surveillance took place and was made aware of any noted defects in the surveilled service. 6.8.2.3.2.  At the end of each surveillance period, if the contractor does not meet a SS performance  threshold  or  other  PWS  or  QMS  derived  standard,  CORs  may  draft CARs  for  addressing  areas  of  contractual  non-conformity  and  forward  to  PM/FSM and  CO  for  review.    Contractor  responses  to  CARs  require  identification  of  root cause,  corrective  action,  follow-up  actions,  and  get-well  date.    In  order  to  manage corrective  action  suspenses  and  subsequent  contractor  responses,  ensure  CORs establish  a  tracking  system  for  corrective  actions  that  includes  date  COR  submitted CAR to PM/FSM, date reviewed by PM/FSM, date reviewed by CO, date issued by CO, contractor’s identified root cause, proposed corrective action, contractor follow-up actions, and get-well date. 6.8.2.3.3.  Identify any scheduled inspections not accomplished during a surveillance period in the monthly surveillance report as not completed and why the surveillance was not completed. AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 43 6.9.  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP). 6.9.1.  Purpose  of  QASP.  The  purpose  of  a  QASP  is  to  provide  a  planned  process  for surveilling  the  contractor's  actual  performance  and  comparing  that  performance  against  the contractual  requirements  to  determine  conformity  with  the  technical  requirements  of  the contract. The QASP identifies and describes the roles and responsibilities for implementing and maintaining the following key elements of contract performance management: 6.9.1.1.  Performance Planning & Preparation. 6.9.1.2.  Performance Assessment Surveillance. 6.9.1.3.  Performance Results Analysis and Reporting. 6.9.1.4.  Performance Assessment Follow-up. 6.9.2.  Identify  Contract  Surveillance  Requirements  in  the  QASP.  QASP  surveillance  is based  on  the  minimum  surveillance  necessary  to  assess  effective  and  efficient  contractor compliance to PWS requirements. Surveillance methods of one hundred percent inspection, customer complaint, audit reviews, and/or periodic inspection are based on service contract type and PWS requirements.  The use of an Award Fee/Incentive Plan (as applicable) may be used in lieu of a QASP for acquisitions greater than $100M. 6.9.3.  Surveillance  Scheduling.  If  scheduled  monthly/quarterly  surveillance  requirements cannot be met, CORs include an explanation in the monthly/quarterly surveillance report for each missed item. In such cases, a statement from the PM/FSM and QAPC/ACO approval for the variance is required. 6.10.  Actions to Address Substandard Services and Contractual Non-Conformities. 6.10.1.  Classifying Contractual Non-Conformities. According to FAR 46.101, there are three levels  of  contractual  non-conformance:  minor,  major,  and  critical.  CORs,  FSMs  and  COs, when identifying the appropriate corrective action should first review the QASP to determine how the nonconformance will be characterized and what appropriate actions are required. 6.10.2.  Corrective  Actions  Available  to  the  Government.  The  types  of  corrective  actions available  to  the  government  for  contractor  services  not  meeting  contract  requirements  are prescribed  in  FAR  52.246.    Examples  available  to  the  government  range  from  re-performance  of  a  service,  requiring  the  contractor  to  develop  plans  to  ensure  future contractual  conformity,  and  financial  withholding,  however,  this  list  is  not  all  inclusive.  In the  most  egregious  instances  of  contractual  non-conformity,  COs  may  pursue  cure  notices and show cause notices.  Note: A contractor not meeting a SS performance threshold during the  prescribed  performance  period  is  considered  a  contractual  non-conformity;  however, failure  of  a  single  surveillance,  in  most  instances,  is  not  considered  a  contractual  non-conformity but a rather a failure to meet contract performance requirements (i.e., standards, performance thresholds, etc). 6.10.3.  Re-performance  of  services.  Under  the  PBSA  concepts  and  FAR  46.407(b), ordinarily  the  first  corrective  action  required  of  an  individual  service  not  meeting  contract requirements is  the re-accomplishment  of the service at  no charge to  the government.  COR documentation of the services not meeting contract requirements denotes the contractor has to re-perform the service. However, upon advice of the technical/functional activity and the nature of the service, the CO may pursue other options. 44 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 6.10.4.  Monitoring Plans to Ensure Conformity of Future Performance. In some instances it is  not  possible  for  the  contractor  to  re-perform  a  service.  According  to  the  Inspection  of Services  clauses,  the  government  can  require  the  contractor  to  take  necessary  actions  to ensure  future  performance  of  a  service  meets  contract  requirements.    In  such  instances,  the CO  should  require  the  contractor  to  develop  a  plan  that  ensures  future  performance  of  that service meets contractual requirements.  In addition, the CO may seek consideration for any services not provided or that do not otherwise meet contractual requirements.  Typically, re-performance  applies  to  a  single  performed  service  but  can  apply  for  a  series  of  services covered under a SS performance objective over a monthly or quarterly performance period. 6.10.5.  Corrective Action Requests (CARs). Once a monthly/quarterly surveillance report is complete, if a COR/C-COR identifies a SS performance objective that does not  conform  to the  applicable  performance  threshold,  the  COR/C-COR  may  draft  a  CAR  for  addressing areas of contractual non-conformity and forward to PM/FSM and CO for review.   The CO makes  a  determination  to  issue  the  CAR  to  the  contractor.    The  COR  identifies  if  the  non-conformity  is  a  minor,  major,  or  critical  non-conformity.  CARs  require  the  contractor  to identify  the  non-conformity’s  root  cause,  a  reasonable  permanent  corrective  action,  and  a reasonable “get-well” date. The CO, in consultation with the PM/FSM and COR assesses the contractor’s response for adequacy. Note: All PWS requirements are subject to surveillance; therefore, CARs are not limited to SS performance objectives and may apply to non-SS items in instances threatening mission accomplishment. Note: Technical/functional support experts such  as  program  managers  or  MAJCOM/DRU  or  base-level  subject  matter  experts  may  be used  to  validate  the  technical/contractual/legal  merits  of  the  non-conformity  and  the adequacy  of  the  contractor’s  “get-well”  plan.  An  illustration  of  the  process  of  addressing contractual  non-conformities  is  shown  in  Figure  6.8.    Once  a  contractor  fails  to  meet  a  SS standard, the COR does  not  need to  wait until  the end of the performance period to  draft  a CAR. 6.10.6.  Liquidated  Damages.  Liquidated  damages  are  used  to  compensate  the  Government for probable damages. Liquidated damages are not punitive or negative but are a method to incentivize  the  contractor  to  maintain  a  satisfactory  level  of  performance.    It  is  used  to compensate the Government for harm caused due to the contractor’s late delivery or untimely performance. 6.10.7.  Cure Notices. Persistently unresolved mission critical non-conformities may result in a  cure  notice.    Cure  notices  are  provided  by  the  CO  and  is  a  tool  to  give  contractor  an opportunity  to  resolve  mission  threatening  non-conformities  within  a  specified  amount  of time.   . 6.10.8.  Show Cause Notices. A show cause notice provides a contractor a final opportunity to present evidence that continuing non-conformities were beyond their control.  Show cause notices should only be issued when other attempts to resolve performance problems have not been successful. If a contractor fails to provide sufficient evidence or satisfactorily respond to a show cause notice, the government may pursue termination as a resolution. AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 45 Chapter 7 RESERVED This  chapter  is  reserved  for  future  implementation  of  an  AF  services  acquisition  training  and certification program. 46 AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 Chapter 8 RESERVED This  chapter  is  reserved  for  future  implementation  of  an  AF  Installation  and  Mission  Support (AFIMSC) directives and processes.

Functional  area—the organization having  responsibility for the  actual performance of a  given service  whether  it  is  performed  in-house  or  by  contract.  For  example,  the  transportation organization  has  responsibility  for  packing  and  crating;  the  civil  engineering  organization  has responsibility  for  custodial  services  and  family  housing  maintenance  (extracted  from  AFM  64-108). On-ramp—contract provisions that provide the government the flexibility to assess the status of the  contractor  pool  for  multiple  award  IFIQ  contracts  and  make  adjustments  as  necessary  to ensure  an  optimal  mix  of  premier  contractors  is  maintained  in  order  to  facilitate  effective competition  on  orders.    On-ramps  allow  new  contractors  to  be  added  to  the  contractor  pool during the term of the IDIQ. Performance objective—outcomes identified from the performance work statement (PWS) and are associated with successful contract performance in a specific area. This is a critical success factor in achieving the organization’s mission, vision and strategy which, if not achieved, would likely result in a significant decrease in customer satisfaction or risk mission failure.  Obtaining multi-services/sub-services performed at a certain measurable standard and consistently ensures success in achieving the objectives critical to the mission. Performance  plan—prescribes  the  objective  in  having  the  services,  the  goals  of  the  MFT members  and  their  roles  and  responsibilities  (to include  the  contractor  performing  the  service), and  how  the  MFT  will  assess  contractor  performance  and  manage  the  contract  to  obtain efficiencies, improved performance, and cost savings throughout its life cycle. Performance  threshold—the minimum performance level of a performance objective required by the government. Portfolio  management—service acquisition portfolio management is an approach to achieving strategic goals by: selecting, prioritizing, assessing, managing and reporting on the scope, service category, and contract  value and type of outsourced projects,  programs,  and other related work based on their alignment and contribution to the organization's mission and associated strategic goals and objectives. Quality  Assurance  Program  Coordinator  (QAPC—)—individual  responsible  for  the coordination  and  management  of  the  performance  management  assessment  program/  quality assurance program. Quality Management System—a commercially viable quality system meeting the intent of far 46.202-4  and  the  quality  requirements  of  the  functional/technical  activity  requiring  the contracted services. AFI63-138   11 MAY 2017 51 Quality  Control  Plan—the  part  of  contractor’s  QMS  that  meets  the  “detection”  function requirement  of  the  QMS  and  defines  the  type,  number,  AQLS,  and  frequency  of  quality assurance/control  inspections  planned by the contractor to  meet  the quality  requirements of the AF as identified by the functional/technical activity requiring the contracted services. Quality  Assurance  Surveillance  Plan  (QASP)—The  document  government  personnel  use  to assess  contractor  performance  (see  FAR  46.401,  DFARS  246.401,  DFARS  237.172),  formerly known as the performance plan.   The use of an award fee/incentive plan (as applicable) may be used in lieu of a QASP for large acquisitions greater than $100M. Requirements  Approval  Authority  (RAA)—RAA  is  the  senior  official  responsible  for identifying,  assessing,  reviewing  and  validating  by  approving  requirements  within  his/her delegation as identified in table 3.1. Services designated official (SDO)—see paragraph 2.1.3. responsible Services  management  agreement MAJCOM/DRU/HAF/PEO  organizational  leadership,  and/or  executing  organization  and  the SSM, delineating the expectations, responsibilities, and delegations within the relationship. (SMA)—agreement  executed  between Services summary (SS)—- a summary of the performance objective and performance threshold required by the government in contractor performance. A SS is also referred to as a performance requirements  summary  (PRS),  a  services  delivery  summary  (SDS)  or  a  performance requirements document (PRD). Structure—as  used  in  tables  2.1  and  3.1  describes  the  organizational  construct  under  which approval authorities are determined by S-CAT.
