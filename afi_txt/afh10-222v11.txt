Scope.  This  handbook  augments,  but  does  not  replace  information contained in technical orders for contingency water systems and subsystems. Users should refer to applicable technical orders for all warnings and cautions and  complete  assembly,  maintenance,  operation,  and troubleshooting information.  Civil  engineer  (CE)  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  (TTPs) in this handbook supports precepts outlined in Air Force Doctrine Document (AFDD)  4-0,  Combat  Support,  and  other  published  guidance  related  to Engineer Operations. They also supports implementation of Air Force Policy Directive  (AFPD)  10-2,  Readiness.  This  relationship  is  illustrated  in  Figure 1.1, the Air Force CE hierarchy of publications. 1.2.  Overview.  This  handbook  addresses  general  characteristics,  setup,  and basic operating procedures for the contingency water system and targets civil engineer utilities personnel while performing their beddown and sustainment mission taskings under contingency conditions. Users without a fundamental knowledge  of  this  water  system  should  also  review  the  references  in Attachment 1. 1.3.  General  Information.  The  contingency  water  system  fulfills  potable water and  wastewater recovery needs at austere locations.  The  water system provides  water  to  support  kitchens,  latrines,  showers,  laundries,  and  other bare base facilities and recovers the wastewater for appropriate disposal. The system  is  semi-automatic  in  that  the  3,000-gallon  facility  storage  tanks  will fill  automatically  as  long  as  the  manually  filled  20,000-gallon  storage  tanks are kept at the appropriate level. Once the system has been filled to capacity, water  should  be  available  for  5  days  given  30  gallons  per  person  per  day usage.  The  removal  of  facility  wastewater  is  also  automatic  under  normal circumstances and does not require manual intervention.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Figure 1.1. Air Force Civil Engineer Publications Hierarchy. 10   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  11 1.4.  Water  System  Design  and  Capacity.  The  Air  Force’s  contingency water  system  is  modular  in  design  and  scalable  to  meet  a  variety  of  user deployment  needs.  It  can  draw  water  from  a  natural  source  and  then  purify, store, and distribute the water while maintaining sufficient pressure, quantity, and quality for an entire base. The selected modular configuration determines the  amount  of  potable  water  the  system  will  produce  per  day.  The  water system consists of a series of color-coded piping, pumping, fluid control, and water storage components that comprise five distinct subsystems. Figure 1.2 lists  color  assignment  for  subsystem  components.  The  five  subsystems  are: (1)  Source  Run  Subsystem  (SRS),  (2)  Water  Production  Subsystem  (WPS) with  Reverse  Osmosis  Water  Purification  Units  (ROWPU),  (3)  550-Initial Subsystem,  (4) 550-Follow-On Subsystem, and  (5) the Industrial Operations and  Flightline  Extension  Subsystem  (Figure  1.3).  To  streamline  installation instructions  in  this  guide,  all  subsystems  are  considered  interconnected,  not stand-alone, and the SRS option is used for raw water collection and the WPS option is used for water production.  Figure 1.2. Color-Coding of Subsystem Components.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Figure 1.3. Contingency Water Subsystems. 12   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  13 1.5.  Safety.  All  personnel  must  practice  proper  safety  procedures  when setting  up  and  operating  water  systems.  Individuals  should  guard  against electrical,  fire,  tripping,  and  falling  hazards.  In  particular,  flammable  fuels, hazardous chemicals, and lethal voltages used in the operation of some water system  components  are  considerable  hazards,  and  failure  to  comply  with technical order warnings could result in injury or death. Review procedures in AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices, when dealing with lethal voltages. It is also important to protect against other water system hazards such as highly pressurized subsystems and components, harmful solvents and adhesives, and infectious  black  and  gray  water  products.  Be  sure  to  wear  appropriate personal  protective  equipment  (PPE)  according  to  applicable  technical information and standards. 1.6.  Additional  Information.  Users  should  refer  to  Technical  Order  (T.O.) 40W4-21-1,  Basic  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources  (BEAR)  Water  System, for additional information such as unpacking, preparation for use, safety,  as-sembly, operation, and maintenance instructions. In addition, contact the Air Force  Civil  Engineer  Support  Agency  (AFCESA)  Reach-Back  Center  when looking  for  information  not  found  in  this  publication  or  references  in  At-tachment 1. Contact the Reach-Back Center at 888-232-3721 (commercial), DSN 523-6995, or email at afcesareachbackcenter@tyndall.af.mil.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   14 Chapter 2  PLANNING AND PREPARATION  2.1.  General  Information.  The  installation  and  use  of  contingency  water subsystems  vary  from  location  to  location  and  depend  a  great  deal  on  the terrain features and the type and quantity of users. Since potential locations or sites may not need every available contingency water subsystem, the modular design  of  the  water  system  allows  planners  to  select  specific  subsystems based on the needs of the installation.  2.2.  Site  Selection.  Before  engineer  work  crews  can  begin  constructing  an installation’s  contingency  water  system,  planners  need  to  determine  the  site location, equipment prepositioning requirements, size of the camp supported, and whether there is access to an adequate water source to sustain operations. Plans  should  be  detailed  enough  to  enable  a  work  crew  to  off-load  selected subsystems  at  the  designated  location  and  assemble  them  in  a  minimum amount of time. Planners should refer to  AFPAM 10-219, Vol 5, Bare Base Conceptual  Planning  Guide,  for  more  information  on  siting  contingency water  systems  and  other  associated  considerations.  In  addition,  engineer planners should take full advantage of Installation Geospatial Information and Services  (IGI&S)  satellite  imagery,  global  positioning  system  (GPS)  data, and  common  installation  picture  (CIP)  databases,  because  these  assets  can dramatically  enhance  their  planning  capabilities.  Some  of  this  information can  be  accessed  easily  and  securely  through  the  Air  Force  Portal  at  the  Air Combat Command (ACC) IGI&S GeoBase web site. The web site is a good resource  for  planning  water  systems  in  relation  to  camp  layout,  terrain,  and available water sources. 2.3.  Layout.  Wherever  the  camp  is  located,  there  should  be  adequate  real estate outside of the camp placement area to allow for  the Water Operations Area  (WOA).  The  WOA  is  an  area  identified  for  the  Dual  Water  Pump Station,  Water  Tank  Farm,  and  Water  Production  subsystems  (Figure  2.1). The WOA should be sited on terrain that is relatively flat and free of debris. Table  2.1  provides  WOA  dimensions  and  the  quantity  of  water  production  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  15 subsystems required based upon camp population. Figure 2.2 shows a typical location for a WOA in relation to the camp facilities layout area. Figure 2.1. Illustration of Subsystems within a WOA.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   16 Table 2.1.

Location of WOA (Typical).   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  17 2.4. Equipment Preparation. Equipment that is ready for installation should be  prepositioned  in  areas  where  it  will  be  used.  Preplanning  should  have included  drop-off  points,  the  establishment  of  temporary  roads  to  the  sites, and  off-loading  equipment,  such  as  forklifts  and  cranes  (Figure  2.3).  When the  equipment  arrives,  work  crews  should  unpack,  inspect,  and  inventory equipment  to  verify  required  components  are  on  hand  (Figure  2.4). Attachment  2  illustrates  common  subsystem  components.  Each  subsystem contains  all  the  parts  listed  in  the  T.O.  inventory,  including  extra  parts  that will be left over after subsystem assembly. The extra parts are intentional to provide  system  flexibility  and  a  source  for  replacement  parts.  Though addressed  in  the  technical  order,  cold  weather  kits  for  these  subsystems  are currently  under  development  and  are  not  included.  During  inventory, unserviceable  or  missing  equipment  should  be  quickly  repaired  or  replaced. Additionally,  make  sure  to  retain  and  store  all  serviceable  packing  material and shipping containers for reuse. Figure 2.3. Heavy Equipment Needed to Preposition Water Subsystems. 2.5.  System  Flexibility.  Work  crews  have  the  flexibility  to  configure  the water  system  to  meet  the  specific  deployment  needs  of  the  unit,  and  the planned or final installation at your base may not look exactly as depicted in this  handbook.  Regardless,  the  diagrams  and  illustrations  presented  in  this guide  are  still  applicable  and  can  provide  sufficient  guidance  to  accomplish   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   18 installation  tasks  even  if  a  different  configuration  of  equipment  is  required. Keep in mind the plumbing illustrations in this guide depict basic subsystem plumbing  using a typical layout and a standard  water production subsystem. Users should refer to T.O. 40W4-21-1 for other configuration procedures.  Figure 2.4.  Inspect and Inventory Subsystem Components.  2.6.  Subsystems  Interface.  The  interface  to  various  subsystem  components is  normally  accomplished  using  suction  or  discharge  hoses  with  quick disconnect  (QD)  fittings.  Connect  these  quick  disconnect  fittings  using procedures  in  Attachment  3.  In  some  instances,  engineers  may  need  to convert  to  Polyvinyl  Chloride  (PVC)  pipe  connections  where  unusual  areas are  encountered  and  water  distribution  plumbing  must  be  buried  to  prevent damage.  Refer to T.O. 40W4-21-1 if it becomes necessary to use PVC or to fabricate other threaded or non-threaded connections.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  19 Chapter 3  SOURCE RUN SUBSYSTEM  3.1.  General  Information.  The  Source  Run  Subsystem  (SRS)  provides  raw water input (source water) for the contingency water system. It can pull water from a raw water source (i.e., river, lake, sea, or ocean)  up to 100 feet away and  20  feet  below  the  pumping  station.  The  system  can  pump  the  source water up to a distance of 6000 feet and to a height of 150 feet to a raw water storage tank.  3.2.  Components.  The  major  components  that  make  up  the  SRS  are illustrated in Figure 3.1 and described in Table 3.1. However, for a complete list  of  all  subsystem  components,  including  nomenclature  and  quantities  per subsystem, refer to Table 3.2 in this handbook and the SRS Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) in T.O. 40W4-21-1.  Figure 3.1. Source Run Subsystem.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Table 3.1. SRS Major Components. Item Function/Use 20 4-Inch Strainer Provides a coarse filter to prevent impurities such as trash, twigs, and debris from entering the SRS. The float buoy, with cable, keeps the strainer end of the suction hose from lying on the bottom of the raw water source where dirt and gravel could enter the SRS.

Depending on the distance from the water source, it may be necessary to connect  multiple  SRSs to reach the camp.  Before installing  the SRS, review the planned dimensions of the water operations area (see Table 2.1 on page 15). Then, refer to component layout diagrams in this chapter and the list in Table 3.2 to identify each numbered component when performing the steps below.    CAUTION To  prevent  injury  to  personnel  and/or  damage  to equipment units, ensure adequate personnel and lifting equipment are available to preposition equipment.  3.3.1.  Position  400-GPM  Pump  and  Assemble  Strainer  and  Float  Buoy. Position  the  400-GPM  diesel  pump  and  assemble  the  SRS  strainer,  float buoy,  hoses,  and  associated  components  according  to  the  following procedures and accompanying illustrations. 3.3.1.1.  Position  the  trailer-mounted  400-GPM  pump  assembly  (Figure  3.2) within  100  feet  of  the  raw  water  source.  Then,  set  the  trailer  parking  brake and chock the wheels to prevent the trailer from moving. Afterward, level the trailer and lower the stabilizer jacks. Figure 3.2. 400-GPM Diesel Pump (Typical).   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   22 CAUTION When  inflating  the  float  buoy,  it  will  become  bulky and possibly hard to handle. Use care to prevent buoy from contacting sharp objects, which may cause dam-age to the buoy.  3.3.1.2.  Inflate  the  buoy  with  the  hand  pump  while  being  careful  to  avoid sharp objects or similar items that could damage the buoy. Then, connect the wire rope to the strainer and float buoy. Configure the wire so that the strainer is  submerged  at  least  four  feet,  when  the  strainer  and  buoy  are  deployed.  If possible,  ensure  the  strainer  is  also  at  least  four  feet  from  the  bottom  of  the raw  water source to avoid sand or silt from entering the system. It may also be  necessary  to  anchor  the  strainer  and  float  buoy  due  to  constant  wave motion (Figure 3.3). Figure 3.3. Positioning Float Buoy, Strainer, and Anchor.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  23 3.3.1.3.  Using  Figure  3.4  as  a  guide,  connect  enough  SRS  4-inch  suction hoses (2, 3, and/or 4) to the strainer and float buoy assembly to reach the 400-GPM  pump  (5).  Afterward,  connect  the  assembled  hose  to  the  inlet  of  the pump.  Ensure  the  hose  is  long  enough  so  the  strainer  and  float  buoy  are deployed at least 25 feet from the shoreline. When determining the amount of hose  length  needed,  take  into  account  the  differences  in  shoreline  location due to tide changes. Note: Always ensure neoprene gaskets are in place before connect-ing suction or discharge hoses. Figure 3.4. Strainer, Float Buoy, and Pump Inlet Component Layout.   3.3.2.  Position  and  Assemble  Pump  Outlet  Branch  and  20,000-Gallon Tank. Install hoses and components from the 400-GPM pump to the 20,000-gallon SRS raw water tank as illustrated in Figure 3.5. 3.3.2.1.  From  the  outlet  side  of  the  400-GPM  pump,  connect  a  4-inch  x  15-foot suction hose to the male QD fitting on the pump. Then attach, in order, a 4-inch swing check valve (6), and 6-inch x 4-inch reducer (7) to the hose. 3.3.2.2. Now, move to the WOA and complete the following actions. Position the  20,000-gallon  SRS  tank  (15)  at  the  edge  of  the  WOA  as  depicted  in Figure  3.6.  Then  install  the  tank’s  vent,  drain  hose  and  ball  valve  (16,  17), and 4-inch inlet elbow (female-to-female) and outlet elbow (female-to-male) onto the tank (Figure 3.7). Next, attach a 4-inch x 15-foot suction hose (4) to  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   24 each  QD  elbow.  Afterward,  connect  4-inch  ball  valve  assemblies  (14),  pipe tee assemblies (13), and 15-foot suction hoses (4) as illustrated below. Figure 3.5. Pump Outlet and 20,000-Gallon Tank Component Layout.   25   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  Figure 3.6. SRS Tank Placement In WOA (Typical). Note: The 20,000-gallon raw  water tank  in  the SRS  will be intercon-nected and parallel to one or more WPS 20,000-gallon raw water tanks spaced  6  feet  apart.  Make  sure  the  inlet  and  outlet  4-inch  tee  branch assemblies  are  facing  toward  the  20,000-gallon  tank  accepting  these connections.  Figure 3.7.  20,000-Gallon Raw Water Tank.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   26 3.3.2.3.  Complete  the  SRS  installation  at  the  400-GPM  pump  as  follows. Starting  at  the  reducer  assembly  on  the  outlet  side  of  the  400-GPM  pump (Figure 3.8), connect enough 6-inch x 150-foot raw water discharge hoses (8) until you are within 175 feet of the swing check valve (6) closest to the  SRS raw water tank. Then, attach a 6-inch x 50-foot hose assembly (9).   Figure 3.8. 400-GPM Pump Connections.  Note:  If  flaking  boxes  (Figure  3.9)  are  used  to  deploy  6-inch  raw water hoses, follow the procedures in T.O. 40W4-21-1, Work Package (WP)  004  00.  Deployment  of  hoses  from  flaking  boxes  requires  at least three people: one to drive the truck and two to remove the hoses from  the  flaking  boxes.  One  of  the  two,  walking  behind  the  truck, should also act as supervisor of the operation.   3.3.2.4.  Next,  install  a  6-inch  x  4-inch  reducer  (10)  to  the  hose,  and  then attach two 4-inch  x 50-foot hoses (11), followed by a 4-inch  x 25-foot hose (12). To finish, connect the hose to the swing check valve.  3.3.2.5.  If  the  subsystem’s  plumbing  is  routed  across  roadways  or  similar heavy vehicular traffic areas, use the hose bridge system to provide hose roll-over protection. Assemble the hose bridge system according to Attachment 4. This completes basic installation of the SRS.  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  27 Figure 3.9. Deploying 6-Inch Hose from Flaking Boxes.  3.4. Operation. The following procedures address basic steps to operate the SRS.  For  detailed  operating  procedures,  including  pump  engine  prestart checks and start-up procedures, consult T.O. 40W4-21-1.  3.4.1. Open the inlet and outlet 4-inch ball valves on the 20,000-gallon SRS raw water tank (and 20,000-gallon WPS tank if interconnected). Close the 2-inch ball valve on the tank drain, and then open the 4-inch ball valves on the pipe  tee  assemblies.  See  Figure  3.5  on  page  23  for  typical  SRS  ball  valve locations.  3.4.2.  Ensure  all  hose  assemblies  (and  pipes  if  transition  kit  was  installed), valves, and fittings on the 400-GPM Diesel Pump are properly connected and tight. Check the strainer and float buoy for proper connection.  3.4.3.  Start  the  pump  engine  according  to  start-up  procedures  for  existing environmental  conditions  (i.e.  cold/warm  weather)  and  allow  the  engine  to warm  up  for  approximately  five  minutes.  Once  the  engine  has  warmed  up, adjust the engine speed to recommended normal run speed, and apply load.  3.4.4. Ensure water is properly flowing from the pump to the SRS raw water tank and WPS raw water tank (if interconnected).  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   28 3.4.5. Once the pump is started and engaged, shut the pump down  when the raw  water  tanks  are  full;  when  service  or  maintenance  is  required;  or  when the pump is likely to experience a dead head condition for more than a brief period. 3.4.6.  Be  sure  to  periodically  recheck  all  hoses,  connections,  pipes,  valves, fittings, and 20,000-gallon raw  water tank(s) for leaks. Make needed repairs and  perform  maintenance  according  to  procedures  in  applicable  technical orders and manuals. Note: Contingency  water  systems  have a  tendency to  leak  a little, so  small  leaks  are  usually  unavoidable  and  should  not  be  a  major cause  of  concern.  Always  ensure  neoprene  gaskets  are  installed before connecting suction or discharge hoses.  3.5. Component Descriptions.

General  Information.  The  Water  Production  Subsystem  (WPS)  generates potable  water  for  distribution  to  user  facilities  within  the  contingency  water system.  Water  purification  is  accomplished  using  the  1500  ROWPU  and/or 600 ROWPU (Figure 4.1 and Figure 4.2) set up in a parallel configuration. Raw water input for the ROWPU is first pumped into  20,000-gallon storage tanks then distributed to the ROWPUs through a series of hoses and fittings. The potable water  generated by  the  ROWPUs is distributed through another series of hoses and fittings to 20,000-gallon potable water storage tanks.  Figure 4.1. 1500 ROWPU.  4.1.1.  By-products  from  the  water  purification  process  include  both wastewater and reject water (also known as brine or concentrate). Wastewater and  reject  water  (hereafter  referred  to  as  brine  for  clarity)  are  distributed separately. Wastewater is routed  to a 3,000-gallon  wastewater  tank. Brine  is routed to a 20,000-gallon brine storage tank and a ROWPU backwash tank.  4.1.2.  The  brine  tank  and  hoses  are  configured  so  that  brine  output  may  be reused  for  fighting  fires,  controlling  dust,  construction  purposes,  improving electrical grounds, decontamination, and various other purposes. However, it should not be used in fire trucks, or for washing aircraft and vehicles if it has  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   32 a high salt content. If brine is not reused, it, along with ROWPU wastewater is distributed by a 35-GPM electric pump (or backup 125-GPM diesel pump) to waste disposal.  Figure 4.2. 600 ROWPU. 4.2. Components. The major components of the WPS are listed in Table 4.1 and  illustrated  in  Figure  4.3.  However,  for  a  complete  list  of  all  subsystem components,  including  nomenclature  and  quantity  per  subsystem,  refer  to Table 4.2 in this handbook and the WPS IPB in T.O. 40W4-21-1.

WPS Illustration Using Three ROWPUs. 34  4.3. Installation. Installation of the WPS is essentially the same regardless of the type of ROWPU used. There are two or three purification units in a WPS basic  configuration,  but  if  more  ROWPUs  are  added,  the  configuration  and number  of  components  will  obviously  change.  Since  using  more  ROWPUs, or  even  interconnecting  different  types  of  ROWPUs  is  optional,  our discussion here will only address basic installation of a three-ROWPU WPS. Before  installing  the  WPS,  review  the  planned  dimensions  of  the  water operations  area  (see  Table  2.1  on  page  15)  and  placement  of  the  WPS 20,000-gallon raw  water tank (Figure  4.4). Then, refer to component layout diagrams in this chapter and  the list in Table  4.2 to identify each  numbered component when performing the steps below.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  Figure 4.4.

Position  the  WPS  20,000-gallon  raw  water  tank  at  the  edge  of  the WOA and alongside the SRS tank. Position tanks six feet apart and ensure the vent and drain assembly is installed on the tanks. Link the tanks together by connecting the 4-inch x 15-foot suction hoses from the WPS tank to the inlet and outlet branch assemblies on the SRS tank as illustrated in Figure 4.5.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Note: Always ensure neoprene gaskets are in place before connect-ing suction or discharge hoses. 36  4.3.1.2.  Before  positioning  ROWPUs  verify  that  a  120-Volt  Alternating Current  (VAC),  1-phase,  60-Hertz  (Hz)  and  a  208-VAC,  3-phase,  60-Hz power  source  is  available.  Then,  position  ROWPUs  approximately  20  feet from the WPS raw water tank and make sure to provide 10 feet of clearance between each water purification unit. Figure 4.5. WPS and SRS Raw Water Tank Connections (Typical).  4.3.1.3.  Position  the  20,000-gallon  potable  water  tank  approximately  35  feet from  ROWPUs,  and  then  install  the  tank’s  vent,  drain  assembly,  and  4-inch inlet elbow (female-to-female) and outlet elbow (female-to-male) onto the tank. 4.3.1.4.  Position  the  20,000-gallon  brine  tank  approximately  50  feet  from ROWPUs, and then install the tank’s vent, drain assembly, and 4-inch elbows. 4.3.1.5. Place the 3,000-gallon wastewater tank approximately 25 feet from the brine  tank,  and  then  install  the  tank’s  vent  and  drain  assembly.

Before positioning the 35-GPM electric pump, verify that 208-VAC, 1-phase,  60-Hz  power the  electric  pump approximately 25 feet from the 3,000-gallon wastewater tank. If power is not available, use the backup 125-GPM diesel pump. is  available.  Then,  place 4.3.2.  Assemble  Raw  Water  Hoses  and  Components.  Install  hoses  and components  from the WPS and SRS raw water tanks to ROWPU locations as illustrated in Figure 4.6. 4.3.2.1.  Starting  at  the  SRS  tank  outlet  branch  assembly,  attach  a  4-inch  tee assembly  (15)  to  the  previously  assembled  4-inch  ball  valve  (10).  Then connect  three  4-inch  x  15-foot  suction  hoses  (11)  with  three  tee  assemblies (9) and two 4-inch ball valves as shown below. At each tee, attach in order, a 4-inch  x 2-inch reducer (16), a 2-inch ball valve (17), and a 2-inch x 1 1/2-inch reducer (18). Each of these branches connects to a 1 1/2-inch raw water discharge hose leading to water purification units. Figure 4.6. Raw Water Hoses and Component Layout.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   38 4.3.2.2.  After connecting the 1 1/2-inch reducer to the ROWPU hoses, ensure the ball valves at the inlet and outlet sides of the WPS raw water tank are open and the ball valves on the three branch outlets are closed. Then confirm the ball valves (14) are closed on both WPS and SRS raw water tank drain hoses. After that, ensure the ball valves on the valve inlets to the ROWPUs are also closed. Keep this configuration until the subsystem is ready to begin water production operations.  4.3.3.  Assemble  Brine  Hoses  and  Components.  Install  brine  hoses  and components  from  the  ROWPUs  to  the  brine  storage  tank  as  illustrated  in Figure 4.7. Figure 4.7.

General Information. The 550-Initial Subsystem is the primary potable water distribution subsystem of the contingency water system. The subsystem may  be  deployed  as  a  stand-alone  potable  water  distribution  subsystem; however,  it  is  designed  for  expansion  and  buildup  to  meet  varying  user deployment  and  operational  needs.  The  550-Initial  Subsystem  (Figure  5.1) normally receives potable water input from the Water Production Subsystem discussed in Chapter 4. However, the adapters supplied with this subsystem do  provide  a  means  to  draw  potable  water  from  other  similar  potable  water sources. Potable water input to the subsystem is typically distributed to three 20,000-gallon fabric tanks for storage. The storage tanks, usually in tank farm configuration,  distribute  the  potable  water  to  a  variable  speed  dual  pumping station. The two pumps are parallel configured, enabling dual or single pump operation, and single pump isolation for maintenance or repair purposes. The remaining operational pump maintains water pressure in the distribution line. Output from the pumping station is applied to a distribution line that is looped and connected together to form a pressurized feed line. User facilities, such as latrines, showers, and laundries, are branch fed from the pressurized feed line. Waste output  from  the user  facilities is processed by  various lift pumps and wastewater  lines  that  distribute  the  wastewater  to  a  wastewater  collection tank for disposal. Hose rollover protection ramps (hose bridges) are provided in the event potable water distribution and/or wastewater distribution requires crossing roadways or similar heavy vehicular traffic areas. 5.2.  Components.  The  major  components  that  make  up  the  550-Initial Subsystem are illustrated in Figure 5.1 and listed in Table 5.1. However, for a  complete  list  of  all  subsystem  components,  including  nomenclature  and quantity  per  subsystem,  refer  to  Table  5.4  in  this  handbook  and  the  550-Initial Subsystem IPB in T.O. 40W4-21-1.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Figure 5.1. 550-Initial Subsystem.  52   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  53 Table 5.1. 550-Initial Subsystem Major Components.

(Continued) 54 Item Function/Use Hose Bridge System Provides rollover protection for potable water and/ or wastewater distribution hoses when routed across roadways or similar heavy vehicular traffic areas. Hoses Route potable water to storage or user facilities, and routes wastewater for disposal. The hoses are color-coded white for potable water and purple for waste-water. Ball Valves Controls potable water flow. Also used to isolate water flow to specific components and user facilities to help facilitate maintenance and/or repair actions.  Check Valves (Wastewater) Prevents waste from flowing back into the facilities, minimizes spills from unforeseen ruptures, and prevents sewage pump systems from over tasking.  5.3.  Installation.  Before  installing  the  550-Initial  Subsystem,  review  the planned  dimensions  of  the  water  operations  area  (see  Table  2.1on  page  15) and the orientation of the subsystem in relation to the remaining subsystems. Then, refer to component layout diagrams in this chapter and the list in Table 5.4 to identify each numbered component when performing the steps below.    CAUTION To  prevent  injury  to  personnel  and/or  damage  to equipment units, ensure adequate personnel and lifting equipment are available to preposition equipment.  5.3.1.  Position/Connect  Dual  Pump  Station  and  20,000-Gallon  Tanks. Place  the  dual  pumping  station  inside  and  at  the  center  edge  of  the  WOA (Figure 5.2) with its 3-inch outlet facing the camp facilities.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  55 Figure 5.2. Siting Dual Pump Station and 20,000-Gallon Tanks (Typical).  5.3.1.1. Starting on the inlet side of the dual pump station (Figure 5.3), attach two 4-inch x 15-foot suction hoses (8) to the 4-inch inlet of the pump station (15). Then, attach a 4-inch tee (14) to the hoses. 5.3.1.2. Position one 20,000-gallon potable water tank (11) approximately 30 feet from the dual pump station inlet, and align the tank outlet with the 4-inch tee  assembly  branch.  Position  two  more  20,000-gallon  tanks  spaced  6  feet apart and along the depth of the WOA. 5.3.1.3. Next, install the tank’s vent, drain hose and ball valve (12, 13), and 4-inch  inlet  elbow  (female-to-female)  and  outlet  elbow  (female-to-male)  onto each of the tanks. Then attach a 4-inch x 15-foot suction hose (8) to each tank inlet and outlet QD elbow. Afterward, connect 4-inch ball valves (10), outlet pipe  tee  assemblies  (14),  inlet  pipe  tee  assemblies  (9),  and  15-foot  suction hoses (8) to complete the tank inlet and outlet branches.  Note: If setting up a 550 Follow-On subsystem with the Initial sub-system and both are on site, then pre-install the 550-Follow-On tank outlet tees and ball valves according to Paragraph 6.3.1.2. This will prevent having to shut down water supply later for camp expansion.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   56 Figure 5.3. 550-Initial Subsystem Dual Pump Station and 20,000-Gallon Potable Water Tanks Basic Component Layout.  5.3.1.4.  Link  the  550-Initial potable  water tanks and the  WPS potable  water tank together by connecting the 4-inch x 15-foot suction hoses from the WPS tank  to  the  inlet  and  outlet  branches  of  the  550-Initial  tanks,  resulting  in  a four-tank farm configuration.  5.3.2. Position Sewage Ejector Systems. Sewage ejector systems should be located next to the facilities they support. Verify an adequate power source is available to the sewage ejector tank then, position sewage ejector systems as follows: Note:  When  installing  the  sewage  ejector  system,  a  backhoe  or similar  digging  equipment  may  be  necessary  for  excavation  and backfill operations.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  57 CAUTION Damage  and/or  destruction  of  Sewage  Ejector  System (Latrine) tank will result if accidental tip-over occurs due to equipment or similar contact occurring as the result of ground-level installation. To prevent tip-over damage, the tank should be installed in-ground to a depth of 24 inches.  5.3.2.1.  Position  sewage  ejector  systems  alongside  latrine  facilities  (Figure 5.4). To determine the exact location, first set up the latrine's drain system to verify its exact ending point. Then, assemble the inlet and outlet components to the sewage ejector tank and excavate a hole for the tank. Figure 5.4. Sewage Ejector System Placement (Typical). 5.3.2.2.  Excavate  a  hole  large  enough  to  accommodate  the  station  tank  to  a depth  of  at  least  24  inches.  Prepare  the  bottom  of  the  hole  with  6  inches  of backfill material of gravel or stone that is not less than 3/8 inch in diameter or larger  than  3/4  inch  in  diameter  (if  available).  Ensure  the  base  is  level  and smooth.  CAUTION In  freezing  conditions,  backfill  material  must  be  dry and  free  of  ice.  Do  not  use  other  backfill  materials unless approved by the manufacturer.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   58 5.3.2.3.  Lower  the  sewage  ejector  tank  into  the  hole  and  insert  backfill material until it reaches ground level. 5.3.3.  Position  3,000-Gallon  Potable  Water  Tanks.  Position  3,000-gallon potable  water  tanks  (24)  next  to  their  respective  facilities  (Figure  5.5)  as follows: 5.3.3.1. Position one 3,000-gallon potable water tank about 25 feet away from the kitchen facility’s water connection. Position additional 3,000-gallon tanks approximately  25  feet  away  and  centered  between  each  of  the  two shower/shave and latrine facilities. Each tank will feed one shower/shave and one latrine facility.  5.3.3.2. Position another 3,000-gallon tank directly behind and approximately 25 feet away from the laundry facility. Afterward, connect all vents and drain assemblies to the 3,000-gallon tanks.  If a BEAR Laundry facility is used, it comes  equipped  with  its  own  3,000-gallon  tank  that  may  be  used  in  lieu  of the tank from the 550-Initial Subsystem. Figure 5.5. 3,000-Gallon Potable Water Tank at User Facility. Note: Always ensure neoprene gaskets are in place before connect-ing suction or discharge hoses.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  59 5.3.4.  Assemble  Potable  Water  Distribution  Loop  and  Facility Connections.  Begin  assembling  the  potable  water  distribution  loop  and facility connections as depicted in Figure 5.6. Note:  If the  550-Follow-On  Subsystem  or  multiple  550-Initial/Follow-On  Subsystems  will  be  used,  the  loop  on  the  550-Initial Subsystem  is NOT closed, but connects to the  next  subsys-tem until the last subsystem assembled closes the loop.  5.3.4.1. Connect the 3-inch x 25-foot discharge hoses (16) to the outlet of the dual pump station. Use as  many hoses as required to reach the loop starting point, which is along the perimeter of the camp facility placement area.  5.3.4.2. Connect one 3-inch tee (17) to the end of the discharge hose. Attach 3-inch  ball  valves  (18)  on  each  end  of  the  3-inch  tee.  Next,  start  laying  the loop  around  the  camp  facility  area  toward  the  water-using  facilities  using 100, 50, and 25-foot discharge hoses. Figure 5.6. Potable Water Distribution Loop Starting Point.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   60 5.3.4.3.  Connect  the  first  hose  to  the  3-inch  ball  valve  at  the  dual  pump station outlet branch (Figure 5.7) and if possible, route the hose so it will not be  subjected  to  high  volumes  of  traffic.  Use  the  100-foot  hose  (5),  50-foot (19), and 25-foot (16) hoses where needed to properly position the hose so it is  centered  and  within  20  to  25  feet  of  the  inlet  side  of  the  3,000-gallon facility tanks.

Check  Potable  Water  Distribution  Loop.  Ensure  potable  water  is flowing  through  the  water  distribution  loop.  Then,  connect  bladder  water level  controllers  to  an  adequate  power  source  at  each  3,000-gallon  potable water tank.  Adjust the bladder water level controls as necessary (see Figure 5.32  and  Table  5.3  for  Controls  and  Indicators),  and  verify  3,000-gallon tanks are being filled. Then, recheck all hoses, valves, and fittings throughout the  potable  water  distribution  loop  and  3,000-gallon  tanks  for  leaks.  Make any needed repairs. Note: Contingency water systems have a tendency to leak a little, so small leaks are usually unavoidable and should not be a major cause  of  concern.  Always  ensure  neoprene  gaskets  are  installed before connecting suction or discharge hoses. Figure 5.32. Bladder Water Level Controls.      AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  87 Table 5.3.

Check Facilities Operation. Once the  3,000-gallon  tanks  for shower, latrine,  laundry,  and  kitchen  facilities  have  sufficient  water,  check  the operation of these facilities according to their respective technical orders. 5.4.7.  Verify Wastewater Collection. Check  wastewater  collection lines  by first  turning  on  and  allowing  water  to  run  in  connected  facilities.  Then complete the following procedures: WARNING To  prevent  injury  or  death  to  personnel,  make  sure Source  Power  is  OFF  before  connecting  power  input to the Sewage Ejector System.  5.4.7.1.  Connect  the  sewage  ejector  system  to  an  adequate  power  source  and verify  correct  pump  operation  by  allowing  the  latrine  holding  tank  to  empty into the sewage ejector system. Repeat this step for each ejector system utilized.  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   88 5.4.7.2.  Check  the  hose  line,  valves,  and  fittings  leading  to  the  macerator pump lift station for leaks and make needed repairs. 5.4.7.3. Set the macerator pump lift station HAND/OFF/AUTO power switch to AUTO (Figure 5.33) and verify the PUMP RUN indicator on the front of the control box is illuminated. Then, verify the SEAL FAIL indicator on the side of the control box is off and the macerator pump lift station is operating correctly. Figure 5.33. Macerator Pump Lift Station Control Box. 5.4.7.4. Check the hose line, valves, and fittings leading to the dual pump lift station for leaks and make any needed repairs.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  89 5.4.7.5. On the dual pump lift station, open the power panel door and set the Pump  1-HAND/OFF/AUTO  power  switch  to  AUTO  (Figure  5.34).  Then verify  the  Pump  1–PUMP  RUNNING  indicator  on  the  front  of  the  control box is illuminated and the Pump 1-SEAL FAIL indicator is off. Next, set the Pump  2-HAND/OFF/AUTO  power  switch  to  AUTO  and  then  verify  the Pump  2-SEAL  FAIL  indicator  is  off.  Afterward,  verify  the  dual  pump  lift station is operating correctly. Figure 5.34. Dual Pump Lift Station Control Box.  5.4.7.6.  Check  the  hose  line,  valves,  and  fittings  leading  to  the  25,000-gallon wastewater  collection  tank  for  leaks  and  make  any  needed  repairs.  When sufficient  water  has  accumulated  in  the  25,000-gallon  waste  tank,  open  the lower  (left)  stage  ball  valve  on  the  intake  assembly,  ensuring  the  middle  and upper stage ball valves on feeding mixer assembly are closed. Then turn on the circulation pump and verify operation of the aerator assembly. As the tank level rises,  sequentially  turn  on  the  middle  (center)  and  upper  stage  ball  valves  for complete  system  operation.  Then,  check  hose  assemblies,  valves,  and  fittings for leaks and make needed repairs.  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Note: The wastewater tank needs to be emptied periodically using either a sewage suction trailer/truck, or by contract.  Make sure that either the mixing pump is shutdown or the stage ball valves are shut off  sequentially  as  the  tank  is  emptied;  top/right,  middle,  bot-tom/left.  If suction is all the way down to the bottom stage, shut the pump  down.  Keeping  the  system  running  while  pumping  the  tank has  advantages  because  the  sludge  keeps  moving  constantly  mini-mizing bottom tank buildup and better tank evacuation. 90  5.4.8. Monitor Potable Water Tank Levels. Keep an eye on the water level of  20,000-gallon  and  3,000-gallon  potable  water  tanks  throughout  the operation of the system. Shut down and start up the SRS, the WPS, and/or the 125-GPM Diesel Pump as necessary to maintain the required amount of water storage.

General  Information.  The  550-Follow-On  Subsystem  expands  and builds  off  the  550-Initial  Subsystem;  it  is  not  intended  to  function  alone. When  used  as  an  expansion  to  the  550-Initial  Subsystem,  this  system functions  identically  to  the  550-Initial  Subsystem.  User  facilities,  such  as latrines, showers, laundries, and kitchen (Figure 6.1) are branch fed from the pressurized  potable  water  distribution  loop  or  feed  line.  User  facility  waste output is processed by various lift pumps and wastewater lines that distribute the  wastewater  to  a  wastewater  collection  tank  for  disposal.  Hose  rollover protection  ramps  (hose  bridges)  are  used  if  potable  and/or  wastewater distribution  lines  need  to  cross  roadways  or  similar  heavy  vehicular  traffic areas. Figure 6.1. User Facilities (Typical). 6.2.  Components.  The  major  components  that  make  up  the  550-Follow-On Subsystem are illustrated in Figure 6.2 and listed in Table 6.1. However, for a  complete  list  of  all  subsystem  components,  including  nomenclature  and quantity  per  subsystem,  refer  to  Table  6.3  in  this  handbook  and  the  550-Follow-On Subsystem IPB in T.O. 40W4-21-1.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  Figure 6.2. 550-Follow-On Subsystem.  97   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   98 Table 6.1. 550-Follow-On Subsystem Major Components.

Installation. Before installing the 550-Follow-On Subsystem, orient the subsystem  in  relation  to  the  other  subsystems.  Then,  refer  to  component layout  diagrams  in  this  chapter  and  the  list  in  Table  6.3  to  identify  each numbered component when performing the steps below.  CAUTION To  prevent  injury  to  personnel  and/or  damage  to equipment,  ensure  adequate  personnel  and  lifting equipment are available to preposition equipment.  6.3.1.  Expand  the  Potable  Water  Tank  Farm.  Expand  the  initial  potable water  tank  farm  (Figure  6.3)  by  using  the  550-Follow-On  Subsystem’s 20,000-gallon tanks as follows. Figure 6.3. Initial Tank Farm Configuration (Typical). 6.3.1.1.  Using  Figure  6.4  as  a  guide,  position  additional  550-Follow-On Subsystem  20,000-gallon  potable  water  tanks  (4)  across  from  the  existing tanks by spacing them approximately 6 feet apart. Align the tank outlets with the manifold joint connections.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   100 Figure 6.4. 550-Follow-On Subsystem 20,000-Gallon Tank Alignment. 6.3.1.2. Install the vent and drain assembly, 4-inch inlet elbow QD (female-to-female),  and  4-inch  outlet  elbow  QD  (female-to-male)  onto  each  of  the  tanks (Figure 6.5).  Figure 6.5. Location of 20,000-Gallon Tank Connections.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  101 6.3.1.3.  Working  backwards  from  the  dual  pump  station  inlet,  begin assembling  each  550-Follow-On  tank  outlet  branch  as  shown  in  Figure  6.6. On the first tank outlet, attach a 4-inch x 15-foot suction hose (1) followed by a 4-inch ball valve (3) and 4-inch tee (7). Align the tee with the manifold to gauge  the  final  connection  distance,  but  do  not  connect  the  tee  to  the manifold at this time. Repeat these procedures for the remaining 550F tanks. Note:  When  aligning  the  tee  with  the  manifold,  position  the  tee slightly  passed  the  manifold  because  the  suction  hose  will  move back toward the tank when they are being filled.    Figure 6.6. Assembly of 20,000-Gallon Tank Outlet Branches.  6.3.1.4.  Using  Figure  6.7  as  a  guide,  close  the  inlet  4-inch  ball  valves  that supply water to the existing tank farm. Then, shut down the dual pump station and close the outlet 4-inch ball valves on all tanks within the tank farm. Next, insert each 550F tank outlet tee into the 4-inch manifold.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Note:  Tank  inlet  ball  valves  are  normally  closed  except  during filling  operations.  If  valves  are  left  open,  a  single  tank  leak  can drain ALL tanks through back feeding.   102   Figure 6.7. Tank Farm Isolation and Insertion of 550F Tank Outlet Tees.    6.3.1.5.  Assemble  550F  20,000-gallon  tank  inlet  branches  according  to  the following steps.    6.3.1.5.1. Connect a 4-inch x 15-foot suction hose (1) to each tank inlet followed by a 4-inch ball valve (3) and 4-inch tee (2) as illustrated in Figure 6.8.   6.3.1.5.2.  At  the  tee  assembly  on  the  first  tank,  attach  another  4-inch  ball valve  to  the  outlet  end  of  the  tee.  Then,  working  away  from  the  first  tank, connect 4-inch suction hoses, ball valves, and tee assemblies to the remaining two tank inlets.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  103 6.3.1.5.3.  Next,  insert  two  4-inch  x  15-foot  hoses  (1)  between  each  20,000-gallon tank. Connect the hoses to the 4-inch tee assemblies already in place. Then, connect two more 15-foot hoses to the tee assembly on the last tank. At the end of the 15-foot hose, attach the branch end of another 4-inch tee and install a 4-inch ball valve on the outlet end of the tee. Note: Always ensure neoprene gaskets are in place before connect-ing suction or discharge hoses.  Figure 6.8. Assembly of 20,000-Gallon Tank Inlet Branches. 6.3.1.6.  Complete  the  tank  farm  expansion  by  inserting  additional  4-inch suction  hoses as depicted in  Figure 6.9 to close the water feed inlet lines to the Follow-On tanks.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   104 Figure 6.9. Assembly of Water Feed Inlet Lines for Follow-On Tanks.  6.3.1.7.  To  recharge  the  potable  water  distribution  loop  and  fill  the  550F 20,000-gallon  tanks  after  tank  farm  expansion,  complete  the  following procedures. 6.3.1.7.1. Ensure the 550F tank outlet ball valves are in the closed position as illustrated  in  Figure  6.10.  Then  open  the  WPS  and  550I  tank  outlet  ball valves and turn on the Dual Pump Station (allows the WPS and 550I tanks to recharge the distribution loop). Afterward, open the ball valve on the branch tee  and  begin  filling  550F  tanks  (ensure  tank  inlet  ball  valves  are  in  the OPEN position). 6.3.1.7.2. Once the 550F tanks are full, close tank inlets and begin normal use of the expanded tank farm. Make sure to rotate tank use throughout the tank farm to prevent water stagnation and refill tanks as needed.    AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  105 Figure  6.10.  Positioning  Ball  Valves  to  Fill  550F  Tanks  and  Recharge Distribution Loop Using WPS and 550I Tanks.  6.3.2.  Install  Latrine  Sewage  Ejector  Systems.  Install  550-Follow-On Subsystem sewage ejector systems (latrines) next to their respective facilities as follows.  6.3.2.1.  Ensure  an  adequate  power  source  is  available  to  the  sewage  ejector tank  and  then  position  the  sewage  ejector  system  alongside  the  latrine facility  (Figure  6.11).  To  determine  the  exact  location,  first  set  up  the latrine's drain system to verify its exact ending point. Then, assemble the inlet and outlet components to the sewage ejector tank. Note: When installing the sewage ejector system, a backhoe or similar digging equipment may be necessary for excavation and backfill operations.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   106 Figure 6.11. Sewage Ejector System Installed Next to Latrine Facility. 6.3.2.2.  Excavate  a  hole  large  enough  to  accommodate  the  sewage  ejector tank  to  a  depth  of  at  least  24  inches.  Prepare  the  bottom  of  the  hole  with  6 inches of backfill material of gravel or stone that is not less than 3/8 inch in diameter or larger than 3/4 inch in diameter (if available). Ensure the base is level and smooth.  CAUTION In  freezing  conditions,  backfill  material  must  be  dry and  free  of  ice.  Do  not  use  other  backfill  materials unless approved by the manufacturer.  6.3.2.3.  Lower  the  sewage  ejector  tank  into  the  hole  and  insert  backfill material until it reaches ground level.  6.3.3.  Install  Kitchen  Sewage  Ejector  Lift  Station.  Similar  to  latrines, ensure  an  adequate  power  source  is  available  to  the  lift  station  and  then position the kitchen sewage ejector lift station alongside the kitchen facility. To  determine  the  exact  location,  first  set  up  the  kitchen’s  drain  system  to verify its exact ending point. Then assemble the inlet and outlet components to the lift station tank and perform the following procedures:  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  107 CAUTION Damage  or  destruction  of  Sewage  Ejector  Lift  Station (Kitchen) tank will result if accidental tip-over occurs due to  equipment  or  similar  contact  occurring  as  the  result  of ground-level installation. To prevent tip-over damage, the tank should be installed in-ground to a depth of 18 inches.  6.3.3.1. Excavate a hole large enough to accommodate the lift station tank to a depth of at least 24 inches. Prepare the bottom of the hole with 6 inches of backfill material of gravel or stone that is not less than 3/8 inch in diameter or larger  than  3/4  inch  in  diameter  (if  available).  Ensure  the  base  is  level  and smooth. 6.3.3.2.  Lower  the  lift  station  tank  into  the  hole  and  insert  backfill  material until it reaches ground level.  6.3.4. Position 3,000-Gallon Potable Water Tanks. Position the four 3,000-gallon  potable  water  tanks  from  the  550-Follow-On  subsystem  next  to  their respective facilities or predesignated facility locations (Figure 6.12). Figure 6.12. Placement of 3,000-Gallon Potable Water Tanks (Typical).   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   108 6.3.4.1.  Position  one  3,000-gallon  potable  water  tank  approximately  25  feet away from the kitchen’s water connection.  6.3.4.2. Position the  next  two  3,000-gallon potable  water  tanks approximately 25  feet  away  and  centered  between  each  of  the  two  shower/shave  and  latrine facilities to where each tank will feed one shower/shave and one latrine facility. 6.3.4.3. Position the last 3,000-gallon potable water tank directly behind and approximately 25 feet away from the laundry facility.  6.3.4.4. Finally, connect vent and drain assemblies to all 3,000-gallon tanks. Note: All water tanks (bladders or vessels) that are inserted into the water  distribution  loop  or  downstream  but  connected  to  the  Dual Pump  Station  MUST  have  a  bladder  water  level  controller  or  be manually filled and isolated with a valve inserted on the inlet side of the bladder/vessel.    6.3.5. Expand Potable Water Distribution Loop and Facility Connections. Using  the  potable  water  components  in  the  550-Follow-On  Subsystem, expand the 550-Initial Subsystem potable water distribution loop and facility connections  according  to  requirements  at  the  deployment  location.  Figure 6.13 provides a basic example of a distribution loop expansion. Note: Always ensure neoprene gaskets are in place before connect-ing suction or discharge hoses.  6.3.5.1. Beginning at the outlet of the dual pump station’s 3-inch branch tee, begin expanding the potable water distribution loop by connecting the 3-inch x 100-foot discharge hoses (9) to the 3-inch ball valve on the branch tee. 6.3.5.2. Using 3-inch discharge  hoses in lengths of 100 feet (9), 50 feet (8), and 25 feet (11), lay out the potable water distribution loop toward the water-using facilities. If possible, route the hose away from high traffic areas. It may be preferable to use the 3-inch x 100-foot hoses first, and then the 50-foot and 25-foot hoses where needed to properly position the hose so it is centered and within 20 to 25 feet of the inlet side of facility 3,000-gallon tanks.  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  Note: If hose rollover protection becomes necessary, assemble and install hose bridge system as illustrated in Attachment 4. Figure 6.13. Expanded Water Distribution Loop Component Layout.  109   6.3.5.3.  Assemble  3,000-Gallon  Tank  Inlet  Connections.

NORMAL OPERATION The following procedures highlight basic operation of the Contingency Water System and do not have to be performed in the order pr esented here. These procedures assume the system was initially fully filled and currently functioning normally. Users should read and understand these and all subsystem operational procedures  prior to system operation. A. Inspect all tanks, hoses, valves, and connections for leaks and repair as required. B.  Regularly check the level of the 20,000-gallon potable water tanks of the 550 Initial and 550 Follow-On (if equipped) Subsystems and pro-ceed as follows:    (1) If the height of all potable water tanks is at least 36 inches, proceed to Step C. (2) If the height of all potable water tanks is less than 36 inches and the source of potable water is the Water Production 1500 (or 600) ROWPU Subsystem, proceed to Step C. (3) If the height of all potable water tanks is less than 36 inches and the source of potable water is the 125-GPM Diesel Pump that is part of the 550 Initial Subsystem, proceed to Step E. C.  Check the height of the 20,000-gallon raw water tanks from the Water Production 1500 (or 600) ROWPU Subsystem(s) and Source Run Subsystem (if installed) and proceed as follows: (1) If the height of the tanks is at least 36 inches and potable water is not required for the 550 Initial and 550 Follow-On (if installed) Sub-systems, continue to monitor tank levels. No action is required at this time.  AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   Table A5.1. Normal Operating Procedures. (Continued) NORMAL OPERATION 152    (2) If the height of the tanks is at least 36 inches and potable water is required for the 550 Initial and 550 Follow-On (if installed) Sub-systems operate ROWPUs in accordance with applicable T.O. as required. NOTE If operation of ROWPUs is required, it may be necessary to operate the 400-GPM Diesel Pump (or 125-GPM Diesel Pump if used) as required to supply sufficient raw water for ROWPU operation (refer to Step F). (3) If the height of the tanks is less than 36 inches and the Source Run Subsystem is installed, proceed to Step D. to startup 400-GPM Diesel Pump. (4) If the height of the tanks is less than 36 inches and the Source Run Subsystem is not installed proceed to Step E. to startup 125-GPM Diesel Pump. D.  Monitor the height of the 2 0 ,0 0 0 -gallon raw water tanks and proceed as follows:   (1) Startup the 400-GPM Diesel Pump in accordance with Opera-tor's Manual Power Tech4.5/6.8 L Tier 2 OEM Diesel Engines. (2) Allow pump to run and fill 20,000-gallon raw water tanks. Pro-ceed to Step F. E.  Energize the 125-GPM Diesel Pumps at the 550 Initial and Follow-On Subsystems in accordance with the following steps: CAUTION Do  not  operate  125-GPM  Diesel  Pump  Assembly  without  water  in pump  case.  Operating  pump  without  liquid  flowing  through  it  will damage pump seals and make pump inoperative.   AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011  153 Table A5.1. Normal Operating Procedures. (Continued)        NORMAL OPERATION (1) Remove pump plug and fill pump case with water. Reinstall pump plug. (2 ) Remove engine fuel fill cap and fill and/ or verify tank is full. Reinstall engine fuel fill cap.  (3 ) Remove engine oil fill cap and check oil level. Add oil as re-quired and reinstall fill cap. (4 ) O pen fuel valve. (5 ) Move throttle lever to run position (right).   NO TE When pulling engine pull start handle, pull with constant steady force. Do not jerk pull start handle cable violently. (6 ) Grip engine pull start handle (3 ) with both hands. Commence pulling the pull start handle repeatedly with strong and even m o-tion until engine starts. If engine starts, proceed to step (7 ). (7 ) If after several unsuccessful attempts to start the pump the exhaust begins to emit white smoke, move the throttle lever to the STO P position (vertical). Pull engine pull start handle out slowly five times then repeat steps (5 ) and (6 ).  WARNIN G Serious injury or death to personnel could  occur if tanks are over-filled and explode. When filling tanks, ensure height of 2 0 ,0 0 0 -gallon tanks do not exceed a maximum height of 6 4  inches. Tanks fill at different rates and  it will be necessary to turn-on and turn-off pumps as required to ensure they do not overfill.     AFH 10-222 Volume 11, 19 May 2011   154 Table A5.1.
