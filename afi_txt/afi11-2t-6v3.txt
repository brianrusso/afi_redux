Scope.  This instruction outlines the procedures applicable to the safe operation of the T-6. With  the  complementary  references  cited,  this  instruction  prescribes  standard  operational procedures to be used by all aircrew operating T-6 aircraft. 1.2.  Pilot’s  Responsibility.  This  instruction,  in  conjunction  with  other  governing  directives, prescribes  T-6  procedures  under  most  circumstances,  but  is  not  to  be  used  as  a  substitute  for sound judgment or common sense. The pilot in command (PIC) is ultimately responsible for the safe and effective operation of the aircraft. 1.3.  Deviations.  Deviations the MAJCOM/A3  unless  an  urgent  requirement  or  aircraft  emergency  dictates  otherwise.  In  that case, the PIC will take the appropriate action to safely recover the aircraft. require  specific  approval  of from these  procedures 1.4.  References.  The primary references for T-6 operations are technical order (TO) 1T-6A-1, Flight Manual, USAF/USN Series T-6A Aircraft; AETCMAN 11-248, T-6 Primary Flying; and this instruction. 1.5.  Recommended Changes and Waivers: 1.5.1.  USAF/A3 is the approval authority for changes or revisions to this instruction. 1.5.2.  Policy  and procedures are enacted to  provide quality  and consistency in  training and evaluation  whether  at  an  undergraduate  or  graduate level.  Occasionally,  unique circumstances  may  warrant  special  consideration  and  possible  waiver  of  policy  provisions. At  the  same  time,  because  it  is  important  to  preserve  fidelity  of  training,  evaluation,  and policy implementation throughout the command, a process must be established for review of proposed waivers. 1.5.3.  Waivers  that  change  the  intent  of  the  policy  outlined  in  this  instruction  are  not authorized without MAJCOM A3 (T-2) approval. Unless otherwise stated in this document, Wing/CCs (T-3) are the approval authority for individual personnel exceptions to the policy outlined in this instruction caused by special or unusual circumstances. 1.5.4.  Units.  Coordinate  T-2  waivers  through  AETC/A3VO  as  appropriate.  Squadron commanders  will  submit  all  T-2  waiver  requests  through  command  channels  in  electronic format. Waiver requests must provide justification why the individual or unit cannot comply with  requirements.  AETC/A3VO  and  the  units  will  file  a  copy  of  approved  waivers  to  this volume according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 1.5.5.  Operations  Group  (OG)  Commander.  The  OG/CC  of  local  supplements  will  handle waivers to unit supplemental guidance. (T-2) 1.6.  Definition  of  Student.  For  purposes  of  this  instruction,  “Student”  refers  to  any undergraduate student pilot, undergraduate combat systems officer (UCSO), or pilot enrolled in a formal training course who has not successfully completed a T-6A QUAL evaluation IAW AFI 11-2T-6, Volume 2, T-6 Aircrew Evaluation Criteria. 8 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 Chapter 2 MISSION PLANNING 2.1.  Responsibilities.  The  responsibility  for  mission  planning  will  be  shared  jointly  by  the individual pilots and the operations function of the organization. 2.2.  General Procedures: 2.2.1.  Sufficient  flight  planning must be done to ensure safe mission accomplishment.  AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and applicable supplements specify minimum requirements. 2.2.2.  Complete takeoff and landing data (TOLD) for all flights. Tab data derived from TO-1T-6A-1 approved performance charts is acceptable and may be utilized when available.  All TOLD programs derived from locally produced algorithms must be submitted to MAJCOM Stan/Eval for approval. (T-2) 2.2.3.  The  FAA’s  Direct  User  Access  Terminal  Service  (DUATS)  is  authorized  for  T-6A aircrew use as an AETC/A3V-validated and -approved flight planning software system IAW AFI  11-202,  Volume  3,  AETC  Supplement.    T-6A  aircrew  will  use  the  T-6A  DUATS FLIGHT PLANNING USER’S GUIDE when using DUATS for flight planning.  The most current version of the T-6A DUATS FLIGHT PLANNING USER’S  GUIDE can be found on the AETC/A3V SharePoint® site.  (T-2) 2.3.  Briefing and Debriefing: 2.3.1.  Minimum  Briefing  Time.  The  minimum  briefing  time  between  the  start  of  the mission  briefing  and  takeoff  is  1  hour.  The  minimum  briefing  time  for  the  first  navigation sortie of the day beginning or ending off-station and for all off-station, low-level navigation sorties is 1 hour and 45 minutes. (T-3).  EXCEPTION:  Two qualified instructor pilots (IP) familiar with the off-station airfield may use 1 hour minimum briefing time. 2.3.2.  Briefing Guides: 2.3.2.1.  Brief students and passengers on their specific duties and responsibilities related to safe mission accomplishment and appropriate training rules. Aircrews will refer to the appropriate  briefing  guides  located  in  this  instruction—Attachment  3,  Attachment  4, Attachment 5, and Attachment 6—and will brief applicable items before each mission. Note: Briefing guides are a reference list of items that may apply to particular missions. In  addition,  aircrews  will  refer  to  Attachment  7  for  T-6  training  rules.    Aircrew  may reference  a  locally  generated  briefing  guide  provided  it  contains  all  information  in  the appropriate attachment. 2.3.2.2.  The briefing guide reference items listed may be briefed in any sequence. Those items  covered  by  written  squadron  standards  and  understood  by  all  participants  may  be briefed as “standard.” Each guide may be expanded as necessary to cover other important items  of  the  flight.  Brief  only  those  items  applicable  to  the  particular  mission  and  in sufficient detail to prevent any misunderstanding between crewmembers. 2.3.2.3.  An  alternate  mission  will  be  briefed  for  each  flight  if  applicable.  The  alternate mission  will  be  less  complex  than  the  primary  mission.  Missions  or  events  not  briefed AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 9 will not be flown. Mission elements or events may be briefed airborne if it is practical to do so and flight safety is not compromised. 2.3.2.4.  All missions will be briefed and debriefed, using the applicable briefing guide as a reference. 2.3.2.5.  Solo  students  will  not  deviate  from  the  briefed  primary  or  alternate  mission profile. 2.4.  Unit-Developed Checklists and Local Pilot Aids / In-Flight Guides (IFGs): 2.4.1.  Unit-developed  checklists  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  TO  1T-6A-1CL-1,  Pilot’s Abbreviated Flight Crew Checklist, if they contain, as a minimum, all items (verbatim and in order) listed in the checklist. 2.4.2.  Unit-developed pilot aids / IFGs will include, as a minimum, the following items: 2.4.2.1.  Briefing guides. 2.4.2.2.  Local  ultra-high channelization. frequency (UHF)  and  very  high frequency (VHF) 2.4.2.3.  Appropriate airfield diagrams. 2.4.2.4.  Emergency  information  (for  example,  emergency  action  checklists,  no-radio procedures, divert information). 2.4.2.5.  Bailout area information. 2.4.2.6.

Training rules. 2.4.3.  Units  will  forward  Unit-Developed  Checklists  and  Local  Pilot  Aids/IFGs  to MAJCOM Stan/Eval for review prior to release.  (T-2). 10 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 Chapter 3 NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURES Section 3A—Preflight 3.1.  Required  Personal  Equipment.  In  addition  to  equipment  specified  in  AFI  11-202, Volume 3, the following requirements apply: 3.1.1.  Due to the nature of the T-6 egress system, each crewmember will wear a visor during all phases of flight, and should be down prior to lowering the canopy. A clear visor will be worn at night or when needed for restricted visibility. 3.1.2.  On  non-local  sorties,  each  aircrew  will  carry  appropriate  in-flight  publications  and  a suitable terrain chart to cover the proposed route of flight. 3.1.3.  G-suits are required when planning to exceed 2 Gs during any portion of a sortie.  An aircrew flight  equipment (AFE)-approved and tethered hook blade knife must be accessible post ejection if the G-suit  is  not  worn. Flight  gloves will be worn from  engine startup  until engine  shutdown.    Flight  gloves  may  be  worn  during  the  exterior  inspection  to  protect  the aircrew’s  hands,  however,  use  caution  to  ensure  that  gloves  do  not  come  into  contact  with aircraft fluids (i.e., fuel, oil, hydraulic.) 3.2.  Aircraft Systems: 3.2.1.  Students  will  not  fly  solo  in  aircraft  requiring  an  operational  check.  Perform operational  checks  during  dual-student  training  sorties  only  if  they  do  not  interfere  with training objectives. 3.2.2.  Off-station system requirements are listed Table 4.1 3.2.3.  On dual instructional sorties, students will not conduct the exterior inspection without IP supervision. 3.3.  Foreign  Object  Damage  (FOD).  To  reduce  the  risk  of  FOD  during  ground  operations, personnel will: 3.3.1.  Not  approach  or  allow  others  to  approach  an  operating  engine.  WARNING:  Be especially careful of the dangers of a spinning prop. 3.3.2.  Avoid using excessive power. 3.3.3.  Avoid prop or jet blast from other aircraft. 3.3.4.  Ensure loose items are secure in the cockpit before opening the canopy. 3.3.5.  To  reduce  the  potential  for  damaging/scratching  the  canopy,  do  not  place  objects  on the canopy transparency. 3.4.  Procedures for Ejection Seat Safety Pin and Inter Seat Sequencer (ISS): 3.4.1.  Solo  student  pilots  will  make  a  radio  call  to  the  controlling  agency  stating  that  the ejection seat safety pin is removed and stowed prior to being cleared for takeoff. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 11 3.4.2.  After  landing,  solo  student  pilots  will  clear  the  runway  and  stop  the  aircraft  prior  to reinstalling their ejection seat safety pin. 3.4.3.  In aircraft equipped with a 3-position ISS (SOLO, BOTH, and CMD FWD), the rear cockpit  ejection  seat  safety  pin  will  be  removed  with  the  ISS  mode  selector  in  the  CMD FWD  position  during  all  sorties  when  non-rated  personnel  occupy  the  rear  cockpit  (RCP). EXCEPTION:  Students enrolled in a formal training course will remove the pin and select the BOTH position on the ISS when occupying the rear seat. Section 3B—Taxiing 3.5.  Ground and Taxi Operations.  Conduct ground and taxi operations according to AFI 11-218, Aircraft Operation and Movement on the Ground. 3.6.  Taxi  Interval.  Maintain a minimum of 75 feet when taxiing staggered and 150 feet when in trail. Use taxi clearances IAW paragraph  3.5 with caution when operating in the EOR.  Use caution when taxiing in the vicinity of aircraft accomplishing an overspeed governor check. 3.7.  Ice  and/or  Snow  Conditions.  Do  not  taxi  if  snow  or  ice  is  adhering  to  taxiways  or runways  until  all  portions  of  the  taxi  route  and  runway  have  been  checked  for  safe  operations. Note: When ice and/or snow are present on the taxiway, taxi on the centerline with a minimum of 300 feet of spacing. Section 3C—Takeoff and Landing 3.8.  Fuel.  Aircraft  will  take  off  with  sufficient  fuel  for  the  planned  sortie,  to  include  required reserve and alternate fuel. The following definitions and requirements apply to fuel: 3.8.1.  Joker fuel is a pre-briefed fuel state needed to terminate an event and transition to the next phase of flight. 3.8.2.  Bingo  fuel  is  a  pre-briefed  fuel  state  that  allows  the  aircraft  to  return  to  the  base  of intended  landing  or  an  alternate,  if  required,  using  preplanned  recovery  parameters  and arriving with normal recovery fuel. 3.8.3.  Normal recovery fuel is the fuel on initial or at the final approach fix (FAF) at the base of intended landing or alternate, if required. This fuel quantity will be the higher of what is established locally or 200 pounds. 3.8.4.  Declare minimum fuel or emergency fuel  to the controlling agency when it becomes apparent the fuel remaining at final touchdown will be less than the requirements indicated in paragraph  3.8.4.1  and    3.8.4.2, respectively. After declaring minimum  or emergency  fuel, add the fuel status call and the amount of fuel remaining (in minutes) to each new air traffic control (ATC) facility. Once established in the local traffic pattern, add fuel status with each radio transmission. 3.8.4.1.  Minimum fuel—150 pounds (200 pounds on solo student syllabus sorties). 3.8.4.2.  Emergency fuel—100 pounds or less. 3.9.  Runway.  Minimum  runway  length  and  width  for  normal  T-6  operations  will  provide  a landing  distance  available  (LDA)  of  4,000  feet  long  by  75  feet  wide  or  heavy  weight  flaps  up landing  distance  plus  500  feet,  whichever  is  greater.  (EXCEPTION:  Operations  group 12 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 commanders may approve the use of 3,000 feet  long by 50 feet wide runways for uncontrolled airfield  low  approaches.  Include  the  approval  in  the  unit  supplement  or  a  memorandum  IAW paragraph  3.55.1.    (T-2).  An  intersection  takeoff  must  provide  at  least  4,000  feet  of  usable runway. T-6 operations require at least 4,000 feet between arresting cables located on or above the  runway  surface.    In  an  emergency  landing  situation  (i.e.,  actual  PEL/FL),  pilots  must consider all factors that could affect their ability to safely recover the aircraft before attempting to land on a prepared surface less than 4,000 feet long by 75 feet wide. (i.e., calculated TOLD, winds,  energy/airspeed  prior  to  touchdown,  configuration,  Runway  Condition  Reading  (RCR), overruns, availability of Aircraft Crash/Fire/Rescue response, etc). 3.10.  Spacing.  (Note:  Refer  to  AFI  13-204,  Volume  3,  Airfield  Operations  Procedures  and Programs,  and  AETCI  11-204,  Runway  Supervisory  Unit  [RSU]  Operations,  for  complete guidance). 3.10.1.  Do  not  begin  a  takeoff  following  another  departure  until  the  preceding  aircraft  is airborne or a minimum separation of 3,000 feet exists. 3.10.2.  Do not begin the final turn after a straight-in has reported at 2 miles unless you have the  straight-in  in  sight,  can  make  a  normal  final  turn,  and  can  maintain  spacing  behind  the straight-in. 3.10.3.  Do not cross the runway threshold to land until preceding aircraft are either airborne, clear of the runway, or a minimum separation of 3,000 feet exists when using alternate sides of the runway for similar aircraft. Minimum separation is 6,000 feet when not using alternate sides or when behind  a  dissimilar aircraft.  For tower-controlled flight  operations,  minimum separation  is  6,000  feet  when  conducting  a  touch-and-go  landing  behind  a  full  stop.  The required  spacing  at  night  is  6,000  feet  (similar  and  dissimilar).  Increase  the  spacing,  as required  when  wake  turbulence  is  expected  due  to  calm  winds  or  when  landing  with  a  tail wind. If it appears as if spacing between two aircraft on final will be a factor, the RSU should direct the second aircraft to go around and offset (as required). 3.10.4.  Do not initiate or accomplish items in the after landing or full stop and/or taxi back checklist until clear of the runway and at a safe taxi speed. 3.11.  Rolling  Takeoffs.  Perform  rolling  takeoffs  during  daylight  or  extended  daylight  hours with a rated pilot on board. 3.12.  Crosswind Limitations: 3.12.1.  Icy runway - 5 knots. 3.12.2.  Standing water - 5 knots. 3.12.3.  Standing  water  due  to  patchy  standing  water  (ponding)  as  determined  by  the supervisor of flying (SOF) - 10 knots. 3.12.4.  Wet runway - 10 knots. 3.12.5.  Solo students - 15 knots. 3.12.6.  Formation wing takeoffs and landings - 15 knots 3.12.7.  Touch-and-go landings - 20 knots. 3.12.8.  Initial takeoffs and full-stop landings on a dry runway - 25 knots. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 13 3.13.  Landing  Gear  Handle  Operation.  When  airborne  and  before  moving  the  gear  handle, the  pilot  flying  the  aircraft  will  make  an  intercockpit  “gear  clear”  call  and  pause  momentarily before  moving  the  gear  handle.  On  pre-solo  contact  sorties,  the  IP  will  acknowledge  “clear” before  the  student  moves  the  gear  handle.  On  all  other  sorties,  “gear  clear”  is  an  advisory  call only. 3.14.  Flaps: 3.14.1.  To  prevent  wear  and  tear  on  the  aircraft  (excessive  side-loading  of  landing  gear), LDG flap touch-and-go and full stop landings are discouraged when crosswinds (steady state or gusts) exceed 10 knots.  This is not intended to limit aircrew when the use of LDG flaps is more appropriate for conditions (i.e., runway length, required training objectives, etc). 3.14.2.  The  LDG  flap  setting  should  be  used  for  full-stop  landings  when  the  heavy  weight flaps up landing distance is greater than or equal to 80 percent of the actual field length. 3.15.  Low Approach.  During low approaches, do not allow the aircraft to touch down. When a restricted low approach is directed, do not descend below 500 feet above ground level (AGL) or below the altitude specified by the controller. Section 3D—Maneuvering Parameters 3.16.  Out-of-Control Flight (OCF) Recoveries: 3.16.1.  Do not practice OCF recoveries without an OCF-current IP on board. 3.16.2.  To avoid entering instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) during OCF recovery training,  a  minimum  of  7,000  feet  of  airspace,  clear  of  clouds,  must  exist  below  entry altitude. Verify cloud clearance before initiating OCF entry. 3.16.3.  When conducting OCF recoveries over clouds, plan to complete all OCF recoveries (to include dive recoveries) at least 3,000 feet above the clouds. 3.17.  Aerobatics.  Perform aerobatic flight only in special use airspace (T-2). 3.18.  Contact  Recoveries.  Practice  contact  recoveries  only  in  day  visual  meteorological conditions (VMC). the  exercise  or  maneuver 3.19.  Aircraft  Configuration.  Unless  specifically  stated description, perform all  maneuvers with  gear and flaps in  the retracted position.  Do not  extend the flaps in an attempt to improve aircraft performance. in 3.20.  Cloud Clearances: 3.20.1.  When  on  an  instrument  flight  rules  (IFR)  flight  plan  under  radar  control  in  a designated  ATC  military  operating  area,  weather  requirements  for  aerobatics,  confidence maneuvers, stalls, and extended trail is clear of clouds with 3 miles of in-flight visibility and a discernable horizon. 3.20.2.  Solo  syllabus  sorties  must  remain  in  VMC  at  all  times,  with  sufficient  ground references to visually navigate to, from, and within assigned areas. 3.20.3.  When  flying  practice  Emergency  Landing  Patterns  (ELPs),  maintain  proper  visual flight rules (VFR) cloud clearances. 14 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 3.21.  Minimum Altitudes: 3.21.1.  Perform  all  parts  of  aerobatic  maneuvers,  unusual  attitudes,  abnormal  flight recoveries,  practice  lost  wingman,  extended  trail,  stalls,  and  slow  flight  above  6,000  feet AGL. 3.21.2.  The  minimum  altitude  to  begin  OCF  spin  training  is  13,500  feet  mean  sea  level (MSL). Ensure spinning stops above 10,000 feet pressure altitude. 3.21.3.  Except while in the traffic pattern or during departure and recovery, the minimum en route and area altitude for a solo-student syllabus mission is 5,000 feet AGL. 3.21.4.  The  minimum  altitude  for  VFR  non-local,  point-to-point  navigation  missions dictated by operational or training requirements is 3,000 feet AGL. 3.21.5.  The  minimum  altitude  to  complete  configured  aircraft  slips  for  training  is  300  feet AGL. 3.22.  Dual-Only Maneuvers.  Solo students will not practice the following: 3.22.1.  Stalls. 3.22.2.  Stability demonstrations. 3.22.3.  Nose-high recoveries. 3.22.4.  Nose-low recoveries. 3.22.5.  Inverted recoveries. 3.22.6.  Uncontrolled airfield operations. 3.22.7.  OCF recoveries. 3.22.8.  ELPs or any other simulated engine-out maneuvers. 3.22.9.  Flaps up patterns or landings. 3.22.10.  Straight-in approaches. 3.22.11.  Slow-flight maneuvers. 3.22.12.  Rolling takeoffs. 3.22.13.  Low-closed patterns. 3.22.14.  Low level navigation. 3.23.  Critical Phases of Flight.  The following flight regimes are critical phases of flight: (T-2). 3.23.1.  Terminal area operations including taxi, takeoff, and landing. 3.23.2.  Low-level flight. 3.23.3.  Formation operations. 3.23.4.  All portions of any test or functional check flight (FCF). 3.23.5.  Any aerial demonstration. 3.23.6.  Flight below 1,000 feet AGL. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 15 3.24.  Rear Cockpit Landings.  Only RCP-landing qualified IPs (or pilots receiving training to gain or regain a RCP-landing qualification under the supervision of a RCP-landing qualified IP in the FCP), may perform RCP landings. Section 3E—Extended Daylight 3.25.  Definition.  Extended daylight  is  defined as the period 15 minutes before official sunrise to  15  minutes  past  official  sunset.  At  the  home  station  and  local  auxiliary  fields  only,  daylight traffic and area operations are in effect during the extended daylight period. 3.26.  Maneuvers.  All maneuvers normally accomplished during normal daylight hours may be performed  within  the  extended  daylight  window,  including  solo  syllabus  sorties.  Under  certain weather conditions,  such as low ceiling  and visibility, the SOF should decide if maneuvers  are appropriate or safe during the above-defined times. Further restrictions may be imposed by the operations group commander. Section 3F—Night Flying 3.27.  Prohibited  Maneuvers.  Aerobatics,  practice  OCF  recoveries,  practice  stalls,  stability demonstrations,  practice  contact  recoveries,  practice  ELPs,  and  practice  flaps  up  patterns  and landings are prohibited at night. 3.28.  Solo.  Student pilots will not fly solo at night. 3.29.  Formation.  Flying formation at night is prohibited. 3.30.  Taxiing.  Taxi with a minimum interval of 300 feet and on the taxiway centerline. 3.31.  Lighting: 3.31.1.  Landing and Taxi Lights.  The landing and taxi lights will normally be used during all night taxiing. EXCEPTION: When the lights might interfere with the vision of the pilot of  an  aircraft  landing  or  taking  off,  taxiing  aircraft  may  extinguish  their  landing  and  taxi lights. However, the taxiing aircraft will come to a stop if the area cannot be visually cleared without the landing and taxi lights. 3.31.2.  Anti-collision.  Aircrews  may  turn  off  anti-collision  lights  during  the  hours  of darkness while in the home base traffic pattern (based on local guidance). 3.32.  Overhead  Patterns.  Fly  night  overhead  patterns  only  at  the  home  station.  Note:  Kelly Field is included for the 12th Operations Group. 3.33.  Instrument Procedures: 3.33.1.  Night  Landings.  Night  landings  at  other  than  the  home  field  require  operational glide  path  guidance.  Visual  descent  path  indicator  or  precision  guidance  systems  constitute acceptable  glide path  guidance.  At towered  fields meeting this criteria,  aircrew are  allowed under IFR to receive vectors for “visual approaches” to increase the frequency and repetition of night landings. 3.33.2.  Filing  at  Night.  Do  not  file  to  a  base  of  intended  landing  (other  than  the  home station)  unless  there  is  an  operable  straight-in  approach  with  glide  path  guidance.  Night alternates must have an operational instrument straight-in approach with glide path guidance. 16 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 3.33.3.  Night  Non-precision  Approaches.  At airfields other than the home field, descents below  a  minimum  descent  altitude  (MDA)  on  a  non-precision  approach  require  glide  path guidance. However, aircrews may perform practice approaches at facilities with no glide path guidance  if  they  descend  no  lower  than  the  published  MDA.  When  landing  from  a  non-precision approach, intercept and fly the appropriate glide path guidance (visual, ILS, etc.). 3.33.4.  Night  Circling.  Do  not  practice  the  visual  circling  maneuver  portion  of  an instrument  approach  or  perform  a  low-closed  pattern  at  night.  You  may  fly  the  instrument portion of a designated circling approach (for example, very high frequency omnidirectional range station [VOR]-A), but you must execute climb out instructions or go missed approach by the missed approach point (MAP). 3.33.5.  Unusual  Circumstances  at  Night.  In  unusual  circumstances,  such  as  an  aircraft emergency  or  a  facility  outage,  the  PIC  will  determine  the  best  method  of  recovery,  which may or may not include glide path guidance. Section 3G—Pilot Weather Categories (PWC  3.34.  PWC  Minimums.  PWCs  are  designed  to  reduce  the  exposure  of  pilots  with  limited experience to the risks inherent during periods of low ceiling and visibility. Table 3.1. specifies PWC  minimums.  Before  assigning  a  lower  PWC,  a  PWC  1  pilot  must  evaluate  the  pilot’s instrument  proficiency.  When  calculating  total  time  for  the  purpose  of  PWC,  the  PWC  1  pilot will not include student, undergraduate flying training, or “other” flight time. Note: Hours in an assigned aircraft may include all series or mission types of that aircraft. Table 3.1.  Pilot Weather Categories (PWC) for T-6 Aircrews. ITEM 1 A PWC  (Notes 1 through 6) 1 2 2 B C Minimum Flying Hour Criteria Ceiling/Visibility Minimums Takeoff and Approach 150 rated hours primary flight time in assigned aircraft and 600 hours total rated time or 250 rated hours in the assigned aircraft and 450 hours total rated time.  A graduate of follow-on training (pilot instructor training or formal training unit) who does not qualify for PWC 1.  Suitable published minimums.  Suitable published minimums or 300 feet and 1 mile (runway visual range (RVR) 5,000 feet), whichever is greater.  Notes: 1. Document PWCs in the Aviation Resource Management System and the Letter of Xs. 2. Certification of PWC 1 status is dependent on the pilot’s demonstrated knowledge and performance in flight under PWC 2 operations and in aircrew training devices with a low visibility capability. The commander of the flying squadron to which the pilot is assigned or attached will certify assignment to PWC 1 by signing an AF Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications. File the AF Form 4348 in the pilot’s flight training folder and annotate the LoX 3. OG/CC may authorize PWC 2 pilots to use PWC 1 minimums for approaches at the home field. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 17 4. If an IP is on board, aircrew may use the IP’s PWC. 5. If the pilot is non-current in instrument approaches, instrument approaches will not be flown until currency is regained by flying an instrument approach under the supervision of an instrument approach current IP 6. Use the approach-end RVR to determine takeoff and landing criteria. Section 3H—Weather Restrictions for Instrument Approaches 3.35.  Filing  Weather.  Do  not  file  to  a  destination  unless  the  ceiling  and  visibility  for  the estimated time of arrival (plus or minus 1 hour) is at or above the appropriate PWC or suitable published  minimums,  whichever  is  greater  (Table  3.1).    Reference  AFI  11-202,  Volume  3  for additional guidance. 3.36.  Takeoff.  Takeoff minimums are specified in Table 3.1 Base the decision to launch a local sortie on the existing weather and forecast for planned landing plus 1 hour. Base the decision to launch non-local sorties on the existing weather at takeoff time.   Reference AFI 11-202, Volume 3 for additional guidance. 3.37.  Before  Starting  Penetration.  Do  not  commence  an  en  route  descent  or  published approach unless existing ceiling and visibility meet the requirements of Table 3.1 During actual IMC, a precision approach monitored by surveillance radar is the preferred approach. Note: This does not prevent instrument practice for other types of approaches if the ceiling and visibility are at or above minimums for the approach being flown. 3.38.  After Starting Penetration.  If a pilot has begun the en route descent, arrival or published approach (or has received a radar vector for the approach) and subsequently determines, weather is below the required PWC or published minimums (ceiling or visibility), the pilot may continue the approach to the PWC or published minimums, whichever is higher. The pilot will determine the PWC decision altitude (DA) or MDA by referring to the touchdown zone elevation (TDZE). When TDZE is not depicted or is unavailable, the pilot will use the runway threshold elevation or airport elevation, in that order. The pilot may land if the runway environment is in sight and the aircraft is in a position to make a safe landing. In all cases, the pilot will comply with the last clearance received until obtaining a revised clearance. CAUTION: The use of PWC minimums on  a  precision  approach  (precision  radar  approach,  instrument  landing  system)  may  require  a pilot  to  execute  a  missed  approach  prior  to  the  published  DA.  In  these  instances,  on  reaching PWC minimums and making the decision not  to continue the approach, the pilot  should start a climb  immediately while proceeding  to  the non-precision MAP.  On reaching the non-precision MAP,  the  pilot  should  continue  with  the  published  missed  approach  procedure  or  alternate missed approach instructions, as appropriate. 3.39.  Simulated Instrument  Flight.  Simulated instrument flight must be conducted according to AFI 11-202, Volume 3. If both cockpits are occupied, the pilot not flying will act as a safety observer  when  the  pilot  in  the  other  cockpit  is  flying  simulated  instruments.  When  flying  a practice approach without a safety observer, the pilot must maintain a composite crosscheck that maintains  situational  awareness  with  terrain  and  other  traffic.  The  pilot  is  not  relieved  of  the responsibility  to  see  and  avoid  other  traffic,  terrain  and  obstacles.  When  flying  instrument approaches in VMC, pilots may fly down to approach minimums if the runway environment is in sight  when  reaching  applicable  PWC  minimums.  Pilots  must  acknowledge  reaching  PWC 18 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 minimums and state their intentions to crewmembers if continuing to publish minimums. Vision restriction devices will not be worn in the front cockpit. 3.40.  Global Positioning System (GPS): 3.40.1.  The  T-6A  KLN  900  GPS  is  approved  for  en  route,  terminal,  and  non-precision approach  operations  requiring  a  minimum  required  navigation  performance  (RNP)  value  of 0.3.  T-6A  aircrew  may  use  GPS  as  the  primary  navigational  source  for  en  route  IFR operations, as well as during the following area navigation (RNAV) operations: 3.40.1.1.  RNAV 2 procedures (i.e., T and Q routes). 3.40.1.2.  RNAV  1  procedures  (i.e.,  standard  instrument  departures  [SID],  standard terminal arrivals [STAR], departure procedures [DP]). 3.40.1.3.  RNP APCH (Required Navigation Performance Approach) procedures down to lateral  navigation  (LNAV)  minima  (i.e.,  approaches  with  “RNAV  (GPS)”  in  the  title).  Additionally, GPS overlay  approaches (i.e., approaches  with  “or GPS” in the title) may also be flown. 3.40.2.  Aircrew  will  check  Jeppesen®  NAVDATA  Alerts/Change  Notices/Notices  to Airmen  (NOTAM)  prior  to  every  flight  in  which  the  Jeppesen®  database  will  be  utilized. The GPS will not be used as a primary source of IFR navigation with an expired database. 3.40.3.  Fault detection and exclusion (FDE) must be checked before using GPS as a primary source of IFR navigation. A loss of FDE constitutes an unacceptable degradation of system performance. In order to meet the requirements of AFI 11-202, Volume 3, FDE must indicate “YES”  before  using  GPS  as  a  primary  source  of  IFR  navigation  within  the  National  Air Space System. 3.40.4.  The  KLN  900  is  a  baro-aided  GPS  system.  When  below  the  transition  altitude, aircrew should set the local altimeter setting on the altimeter page of the KLN 900 prior to commencing  RNAV  instrument  approaches,  SIDs,  DPs,  STARs,  T  or  Q  routes.  In  some cases, an incorrect  altimeter setting may induce an erroneous receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) failure indication resulting in an aborted GPS operation. 3.40.5.  RNAV  1  and  RNAV  2  procedures.  Aircrew  are  approved  to  conduct  RNAV  1 procedures (RNAV SID, STAR, DP) and RNAV 2 procedures (T or Q routes) IAW AFI 11-202,  Volume  3  and  FAA  Advisory  Circular  (AC)  90-100A,  U.  S.  Terminal  and  En  Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations, with the following restrictions: flying  RNAV  SIDs,  DPs,  STARs,  T  or  Q 3.40.5.1.  If routes,  or  RNAV alternate/substitution,  aircrew  will  check  “terminal”  predictive  receiver  autonomous integrity  monitoring  (P-RAIM)  for  their  route  of  flight  during  preflight  planning  at http://sapt.faa.gov  to  ensure  GPS  satellite  coverage.  Aircrew  will  use  the  “with  baro-aiding”  tabs  when  referencing  this  site.    While  the  KLN  900  GPS  has  the  on-board capability  to  provide  non-precision  approach  (NPA)  P-RAIM,  it  does  not  have  an  on-board P-RAIM capability for “terminal” or “en-route operations”. 3.40.5.2.  When flying an RNAV SID, DP or STAR the procedure must be retrieved by procedure name from the onboard navigation database in its entirety and conform to the charted  procedure.    Aircrew  will  verify  their  aircraft  navigation  system  is  operating correctly  and  the  correct  runway  and  departure  procedure  (including  any  applicable  en AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 19 route  transition)  are  entered  and  properly  depicted.    If  a  SID,  DP,  or  STAR  contains  a course  to  altitude  (CA)  leg  or  a  fix  to  manual  termination  (FM)  leg,  utilization  of  the omnibearing select (OBS) function and manual selection of the course may be necessary. Aircrew will not attempt to fly radius to fix (RF) legs. 3.40.5.3.  When flying RNAV SIDs or DPs aircrew will have an RNAV (GPS) approach loaded for the airfield that they are departing. This will ensure proper RAIM sensitivity within 30 nautical miles (nm) of the departure airfield and that the course deviation index (CDI)  is  in  the  proper  scale.  For  SIDs  and  DPs  extending  beyond  30  nm,  aircrew  will ensure the CDI is set to terminal sensitivity (1 nm) on the Mode page for the remainder of the SID or DP and that the aircraft remains within half-scale deflection. Note: While it is possible for aircrew to  select  a desired CDI scale for the KLN 900, it is not  possible to select the RAIM sensitivity. Improper RAIM sensitivity beyond 30 nm is permitted under FAA AC 90-100A. 3.40.5.4.  When  flying  RNAV  STARs  aircrew  will  have  an  RNAV  (GPS)  approach loaded for their destination to ensure proper RAIM and CDI sensitivity within 30 nm of the  destination.  If  commencing  an  RNAV  STAR  outside  of  30  nm,  aircrew  will  ensure the  CDI  is  set  to  terminal  sensitivity  (1  nm)  on  the  Mode  page  and  that  the  aircraft remains  within  half-scale  deflection.  Improper  RAIM  sensitivity  beyond  30  nm  is permitted under FAA AC 90-100A. 3.40.5.5.  When  flying  conventional  SIDs,  DPs,  STARs,  or  IAPs  (Instrument  Approach Procedures)  using  RNAV,  comply  with  RNAV  alternate/substitution  guidance  in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 1, Instrument Flight Procedures, AFI 11-202, Volume 3, and FAA  AC  90-108,  Use  of  Suitable  Area  Navigation  (RNAV)  Systems  on  Conventional Routes and Procedures. Aircrew will ensure the CDI is set to terminal sensitivity (1 nm) on the Mode page. 3.40.5.5.1.  The  KLN-900  is  a  suitable  navigation  system  for  substitute/alternate means  of  navigation  on  Terminal  Arrival  Areas  (TAA)  published  on  conventional ILS procedures IAW FAA AC 90-108. 3.40.5.5.1.1.  If  a  conventional  ILS  approach  contains  the  note  “GPS  Required” and  contains  a  standalone  waypoint  requiring  the  use  of  GPS  (i.e.,  a  TAA), aircrew  are  authorized  to  fly  this  approach  and  must  retrieve  the  waypoint  from the  database.    Note:  If  navigation  requires  lateral  guidance  based  on  a  localizer course (i.e., holding), localizer raw data must be monitored for lateral navigation. 3.40.5.5.1.2.  Aircrew  are  not  authorized  to  fly  conventional  ILS  approach procedures which contain the note “GPS Required” and contain RNAV segments consisting  of  multiple  consecutive  RNAV  waypoints  or  contain  a  missed approach (point or segment) based solely on RNAV. 3.40.5.6.  It is not possible to retrieve entire RNAV T and Q routes from the database of the KLN 900; however, extracting individual named fixes from the database is permitted under  FAA  AC  90-100A,  provided  all  fixes  along  the  published  route  to  be  flown  are inserted.  Manual  entry  of  waypoints  using  latitude  and/or  longitude  or  place  and/or bearing is not permitted.  To ensure that the aircraft remains within the expected distance 20 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 from route centerline, aircrew will ensure a CDI scale of 1 nm is selected from the Mode page and that the aircraft remains within full scale deflection. 3.40.6.  RNP  APCH  procedures.  The  KLN  900  GPS  is  approved  for  RNP  APCH procedures (i.e., approaches with RNAV (GPS) in the title) utilizing the LNAV and circling lines of minima IAW AFI 11-202, Volume 3 and FAA AC 90-105, Approval Guidance for RNP Operations and Barometric Vertical Navigation in the U.S. National Airspace System.  Suitable procedures for the T-6A will state “GPS Required” or “GNSS Required”.  Aircrew are NOT authorized to fly RNP AR APCH (Required Navigation Performance Authorization Required  Approach)  procedures  (i.e.,  approaches  with  RNAV  (RNP)  in  the  title).  RNAV (GPS) approaches will be flown in accordance with AFI 11-202, Volume 3, MAJCOM and local  supplements.  Aircrew  must  complete  MAJCOM-directed  training  for  use  of  these systems  down  to  LNAV  minima  before  IFR  use.  Additionally,  the  following  restrictions apply: 3.40.6.1.  Aircrew  should  check  P-RAIM  prior  to  departure  and  will  check  P-RAIM  on STA  5  prior  to  commencing  an  RNAV  (GPS)  approach.  Ensure  that  the  ETA  for  the prediction is accurate. 3.40.6.2.  Aircrew will not attempt to fly radius to fix (RF) legs. 3.40.6.3.  The  KLN  900  GPS  does  not  display  RNAV  instrument  approach  segment distances  in  tenths  of  a  mile.  In  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  AFMAN  11-217, Volume  1,  aircrew  must  ensure  that  once  established  on  the  unverified  segments  of  the approach,  the  electronic  horizontal  situation  indicator  (EHSI)  distance  is  evaluated  to ensure an appropriate published charted value. If the value is appropriate based on current aircraft  position,  crews  may  continue  the  approach.  Deviations  from  expected  values should  be  treated  conservatively  and  crews  will  abort  the  approach  if  the  evaluated distance does not correspond to within 0.1 nm of the FLIP published value. Section 3I—Formation 3.41.  Maximum  Size.  The  maximum  flight  formation  size  is  four  aircraft.    MAJCOM Stan/Eval may approve larger formations upon request. 3.42.  Lead Change: 3.42.1.  The minimum altitude for a lead change within a formation is 500 feet AGL. 3.42.2.  Do not initiate a lead change with the wingman farther back than a normal fingertip or route position or greater than 30 degrees back from line abreast.  This does not restrict lead changes initiated as a result of an emergency or when other unusual circumstances dictate. 3.42.3.  Do  not  initiate  a  lead  change  unless  the  aircraft  assuming  the  lead  is  in  a  position from which the lead change can be safely initiated and visual contact maintained. 3.43.  Takeoff: 3.43.1.  Two-ship formation wing takeoffs require a minimum of 150 feet of runway width. 3.43.2.  For formation wing takeoffs, the ceiling and visibility must be greater than or equal to  circling  minimums  or  500  feet  and  1  1/2  miles  (whichever  is  higher).  The  maximum AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 21 crosswind  component  for  wing  takeoffs  is  15  knots,  and  the  runway  must  be  free  from standing water, ice, slush, or snow. 3.43.3.  Formations will accomplish an interval takeoff whenever calculated minimum power at 60 KIAS is less than 85% torque. 3.43.4.  Two-ship formation interval takeoffs require a minimum runway width of 75 feet. 3.43.5.  For interval takeoffs, the ceiling and visibility must be greater than or equal to 1,500 feet and 3 miles, respectively. 3.43.6.  Four-ship slot or echelon lineup requires a runway greater than or equal to 300 feet wide. 3.43.7.  Four-ship element lineups will use 500 feet of spacing between elements on runways less  than  300  feet  wide.  If  runway  length  is  a  factor,  formations  will  choose  an  alternate departure method (e.g., interval takeoff, trail departure, splitting elements, etc.)” 3.44.  En  Route.  Four-ship  formations  will  not  cruise  in  IMC,  but  may  climb  or  descend through IMC. 3.45.  Approach and Landing: 3.45.1.  Planned formation low approaches will  be initiated no lower  than 100 feet  AGL to reduce the possibility of an inadvertent touchdown. 3.45.2.  Formation wing landings are prohibited when: 3.45.2.1.  The crosswind component exceeds 15 knots. 3.45.2.2.  Standing water, ice, slush, or snow are on the runway. 3.45.2.3.  The runway width is less than 150 feet. 3.45.2.4.  The weather is less than 500 foot ceiling and 1 1/2 miles visibility or published approach minimums, whichever is higher.   Additionally, do not commence a formation approach  with  weather  reported  below  these  minimums.    (EXCEPTION:  An  actual emergency requiring  a formation approach  and/or landing may  initiate an approach  and continue to published minimums or compatible PWC minimums, whichever is higher). 3.45.3.  Formation wing touch-and-go landings are prohibited. 3.45.4.  The formation VMC drag maneuver may be used to establish spacing for single-ship landings when conditions do not permit a formation wing landing only when it has been pre-briefed.  The  briefing  must  include  the  specific  traffic  pattern  or  instrument  approach procedure to be flown. 3.45.4.1.  Minimum  weather  required  for  the  drag  maneuver  is  1,500  foot  ceiling  and  3 miles visibility. All aircraft will maintain VMC from the drag point to landing. 3.45.4.2.  Prior to directing a VMC drag maneuver while operating under IFR, the flight lead will coordinate with the appropriate ATC agency for non-standard formation for the remainder of the approach. 3.45.4.3.  Minimum spacing is  3,000 feet  unless  greater spacing is  briefed. Anytime the spacing  is  in  question,  the  wingman  will  go-around  or  execute  the  missed  approach, notify ATC, and comply with local procedures. 22 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 3.45.4.4.  Wingmen may use pre-briefed power settings and configurations (speed brake, gear,  and  flaps)  to  establish  and  maintain  spacing.  Wingmen  will  not  fly  less  than  final approach airspeed and S-turns will not be used to gain or maintain separation while on an instrument approach final. 3.45.4.5.  The  latest  drag  point  must  allow  adequate  time  for  the  wingman  to  establish required separation and then for the flight lead to slow to final approach airspeed no later than  3  nm  from  the  runway.  On  instrument  approaches,  the  drag  will  normally  be accomplished in order to establish separation prior to the FAF or glideslope intercept. 3.46.  Maneuvers: 3.46.1.  Fingertip  Formation.  Limit  maneuvering  to  120  knots  minimum  airspeed, approximately 90 degrees of bank, and 2 to 3 Gs. 3.46.2.  Route.  Maximum bank angle is approximately 60 degrees. 3.46.3.  Echelon.  Maximum bank angle is approximately 60 degrees. 3.46.4.  Close  Trail.  Limit maneuvering to turns and modified lazy eights, using 120 knots minimum airspeed, approximately 90 degrees of bank, and 2 to 3 Gs. 3.46.5.  Extended  Trail.  Using  100  knots  minimum  airspeed,  limit  maneuvering  to  turns, loops,  barrel  rolls,  modified  lazy  eights,  modified  Cuban  eights,  and  cloverleafs.  Do  not perform  abrupt  turn  reversals;  that  is,  turns  in  one  direction  followed  by  a  rapid, unanticipated roll into a turn in  the opposite direction. Extended trail is limited to  two-ship formations. Perform a G-awareness exercise before flying maneuvers in extended trail. 3.46.6.  Practice Lost Wingman.  Practice lost wingman procedures in VMC. 3.46.7.  Formation  Low  Levels.  Formation  low  levels  will  only  be  flown  by  80FTW aircrew. 3.46.8.  Fluid Maneuvering.  Fluid Maneuvering will only be flown by 80FTW aircrew. 3.46.9.  Tactical Formation.  Tactical formation will only be flown by 80FTW aircrew. 3.47.  Solo Students.  Solo students will not fly: 3.47.1.  Actual or simulated instrument approaches and landings as lead or wing. 3.47.2.  Close trail as wing. 3.47.3.  The fingertip position when accomplishing in-flight checks or radio channel changes. 3.47.4.  Practice lost wingman procedures while on the wing. 3.47.5.  Extended trail level 3 as wing. 3.47.6.  Formation landings (wing or lead). 3.47.7.  Formation wing or interval takeoffs from the wing position. 3.48.  Three-  and  Four-Ship  Formations.  For  three-  and  four-ship  formations,  all  members will  be  qualified  pilots  and  a  4-ship  certified  IP  will  be  aboard  each  aircraft.  The  operations group commander (or designated representative) will approve all three- and four-ship flights. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 23 Section 3J—Low-Level Routes 3.49.  Solo Restriction.  Single-ship low levels will not be flown solo. 3.50.  Daylight Restriction.  To minimize the possibility of a bird strike and avoid the problems associated with  visual illusions, enter the route no earlier than 30 minutes after sunrise (1 hour for  mountainous  terrain)  and  exit  the  route  no  later  than  30  minutes  before  sunset  (1  hour  for mountainous terrain). 3.51.  Minimum  Altitudes.  Fly  low-level  navigation  at  an  altitude  of  500  to  1,500  feet  AGL. When  terrain  height  varies,  maintain  a  minimum  of  500  feet  above  the  highest  terrain  within 2,000 feet of the aircraft. 3.52.  Obstacle Clearances.  Towers and other manufactured obstacles are more difficult to see than high terrain. Note: For towers on or near the route, plan to fly a minimum of 500 feet above the  highest  obstacle  within  2  nm  of  the  aircraft.  Once  the  obstacle  is  acquired  visually  and positively identified, a 2,000-foot lateral clearance will be maintained. Section 3K—Simulated Emergency Procedures 3.53.  Restrictions: 3.53.1.  Airborne  simulated  emergencies  to  include  ELPs  and  flaps  up  operations  will  be briefed  and  will  only  be  conducted  during  day  VMC  weather  conditions.  Simulated emergency  practice  will  be  discontinued  if  intercockpit  communications  cannot  be maintained. Compound or multiple simulated emergencies are prohibited with the exception of  ELPs  which  may  be  flown  in  any  flap  setting  to  simulate  a  malfunctioning  Emergency Gear Extension system. 3.53.2.  Pilots  will  not  practice  simulated  engine  failures  on  takeoff  that  require  a  landing straight  ahead,  a  turn  back  to  land  opposite  direction  from  the  runway  just  departed,  or  a teardrop to  another crossing or parallel  runway.  Those procedures will only be practiced in the simulator. 3.54.  ELPs: 3.54.1.  ELPs  may  be  flown  at  uncontrolled  airfields  according  to  Section  3L  of  this instruction. 3.54.2.  When  conducted  in  controlled  airspace,  ELPs  must  be  coordinated  with  the  ATC agencies responsible for the airspace the ELP will transit. 3.54.3.  ELPs at towered airfields may only be flown at airfields with an approved MAJCOM LOA (according to the MAJCOM supplement to AFI 11-202, Volume 3). 3.54.4.  Zero  torque  ELPs  may  only  be  flown  to  a  low  approach  (no  lower  than  200  feet AGL). 3.54.5.  Straight-in  ELPs  may  be  flown  at  auxiliary  fields  by  instructor  development  (ID) crews  if  no  more  than  two  aircraft  are  in  the  pattern  (no  solos).  Bases  will  evaluate operational  risk  management  impacts  and  publish  deconfliction  procedures  (approved  by AETC/A3V)  for  straight-in  ELPs  in  a  local  supplement  to  AETCI  11-204  before implementing this training at their auxiliary fields. 24 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 Section 3L—Uncontrolled Airfield Operations 3.55.  Requirements.  With the operations group commander’s approval, aircrews may conduct operations at uncontrolled, civil (not private) airfields, with the following restrictions: 3.55.1.  Operations  group  commanders  will  designate  approved  uncontrolled  airfields  for routine  use  in  writing  in  the  unit  supplement  to  this  instruction  or  as  a  stand-alone memorandum. (T-2).  The supplement or memorandum will, at  a minimum, list the airfield name,  ICAO  airfield  identifier,  runway  length  and  width,  field  elevation,  common  traffic advisory  frequency [CTAF], pattern direction of turn (if non-standard), and  any descriptors or unique characteristics identified during the airfield review. (T-2). into  specific 3.55.1.1.  Operations  group  commanders  may  approve  operations uncontrolled airfields not designated IAW paragraph 3.55.1, on a case-by-case basis, for non-routine use (i.e., cross-country, out & back sorties, or airfield review/survey).  Units will describe these approval procedures in the unit supplement to this instruction. (T-2). 3.55.1.2.  The  guidance in  paragraph  3.55.1  and    3.55.1.1 do not  restrict aircrew from using any suitable runway during an actual aircraft emergency. 3.55.2.  They will be flown single-ship only. Two-ship formations may split into single ships prior  to  commencing  uncontrolled  airfield  operations.  Split  two-ship  formations  are considered two single ships for the purposes of this paragraph and paragraph  3.55.6 3.55.3.  Winds must be within limits for each runway to which the aircrew operates as best as can  be  determined  with  available  information.  Fly  the  instrument  approach  most  suited  for the winds. If the uncontrolled airfield only has one approach and it is opposite direction for the  wind  conditions,  it  may  be  flown  under  any  wind  conditions  but  aircrew  must  monitor (via  CTAF  or  visually)  any  departing  aircraft  to  ensure  safety  of  flight  and  traffic deconfliction. 3.55.4.  All  patterns  and  approaches  will  be  flown  to  a  low  approach.  (EXCEPTION:  Full stops  and  takeoffs  may  be  performed  by  aircrews  flying  to/from  an  auxiliary  field  for  the purpose of manning the RSU.) In the event a landing is required at an uncontrolled airfield for  other  than  RSU  manning,  the  operations  group  commander  will  ensure  fire  or  crash recovery  and  maintenance  personnel,  as  appropriate  to  the  situation,  are  available  for  the subsequent launch.  (T-3).  Aircrews will make CTAF radio calls prior to taxiing and taking the runway for takeoff. 3.55.5.  Aircrews  will  monitor  the  published  CTAF  and  make  all  radio  calls  and  position reports recommended in AFMAN 11-217, Volume 2, Visual Flight Procedures, and the FAA Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM) Official Guide to Basic Flight Information and ATC Procedures, available at: http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/. 3.55.6.  No  more  than  two  aircraft  (total),  military  and/or  civilian,  may  be  in  the  pattern  at any time. 3.55.7.  Instrument  approaches,  rectangular  patterns  (as  depicted  in  FAA  AIM),  and  ELPs may  be  flown.  Rectangular  patterns  and  ELPs  will  be  flown  left  hand  traffic,  unless  the airfield  traffic  pattern  indicators  or  flight  information  publications  (FLIP)  depict  otherwise. No overhead patterns will be flown. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 25 3.55.8.  The maximum airspeed for pattern/approach operations within 1,500 feet AGL and 3 nm of an uncontrolled airfield is 150 KIAS. 3.55.9.  Instrument approaches will be flown under IFR clearance. The OG/CC or equivalent is the approval authority to allow units to practice instrument approaches under VFR. 3.55.10.  Weather  restrictions  for  instrument  approaches  are  as  listed  in  Section  3H  of  this instruction. 3.55.11.  For  entry  other  than  by  an  instrument  approach,  aircrews  must  maintain  cloud clearances and visibility appropriate for their type of flight plan (IFR or VFR) and airspace. If  an  aircrew  is  approaching  the  airfield  on  an  IFR  clearance  and  not  intending  to  fly  an instrument  approach,  weather  conditions  must  permit  a  VMC  descent  from  the  appropriate IFR en route altitude. 3.55.12.  Aircrews  will  immediately  notify  the  SOF  if  any  hazardous  conditions  exist  at  an uncontrolled airfield that would prevent normal operations. Section 3M—Operating in High Wind or Sea States 3.56.  Restrictions.  Units  will  restrict  their  flying  operations  when  high  winds  or  sea  states would  be  hazardous  to  aircrew  members  in  ejection  situations.  Flights  are  not  permitted  over land when steady state surface winds (forecast or actual) in training or operating areas exceed 35 knots. Unless otherwise approved by the OG/CC, over-water flights will not be permitted when forecast  or  actual  wave  heights  exceed  10  feet  or  surface  winds  exceed  25  knots  in  training  or operating areas. This is not intended to restrict operations when only a small portion of the route or area is affected. Section 3N—Advanced Handling Characteristic (AHC) Program 3.57.  Restrictions.  Comply  with  AHC  restrictions  listed  in  AETCMAN  11-248,  T-6  Primary Flying, Attachment 4. Section 3O—Chase Procedures 3.58.  Restrictions: 3.58.1.  Any  formation-qualified  IP  may  fly  safety  chase  for  aircraft  under  emergency conditions (or impending emergency conditions). 3.58.2.  A chase aircraft will maneuver as necessary to observe performance, but is primarily responsible for aircraft separation. Generally, a chase aircraft will maneuver in a 30- to 60-degree  cone  out  to  1,000  feet  from  which  the  pilot  can  effectively  clear  and/or  provide assistance. The chase aircraft will not stack lower than lead aircraft below 1,000 feet AGL. 3.58.3.  Unless  safety  or  circumstance  dictate  otherwise,  a  chase  aircraft  will  low-approach no lower than 300 feet AGL. 26 AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 Chapter 4 OPERATING RESTRICTIONS 4.1.  General.  Table 4.1 will assist the pilot in determining the minimum systems required for takeoff. Aircraft status is determined according to AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting, and any applicable supplement. Table 4.1.  Operating Restrictions (Excluding FCF).

Do not plan to fly any unnecessary increased-G maneuvers with an inoperative IDARS. LEGEND:  Dual –Both cockpits occupied Solo –Front cockpit only occupied Yes – Aircraft is acceptable for flight  No – Aircraft is not acceptable for flight  AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 27 4.2.  Factors  to  Consider  for  Aircraft  Malfunctions.  Once  airborne,  aircraft  commanders must  weigh  all  pertinent  factors  when  deciding  whether  to  continue  or  to  abort  a  sortie  for  an aircraft  malfunction.  Factors  to  consider  include  student  mission  requirements  and  weather conditions at the home base and divert base. Solo students will contact the RSU controller (if in the pattern) or the SOF (if outside the pattern) for instructions. 4.3.  Deviation  Approval.  Operations  group  commanders  may  approve  deviations  from  the restrictions  listed  in  Table  4.1  on  a  flight-by-flight  basis  if  there  is  no  compromise  of  flight safety or Air Force directives. This  authority may  not  be delegated below the operations group deputy commander. 4.4.  Solo Flying: 4.4.1.  Aircraft may be flown solo with instrument or system malfunctions in the rear cockpit that does not affect safety of flight. 4.4.2.  Student  pilots  will  not  fly  solo  in  an  aircraft  with  a  known  malfunction  unless approved  by  the  squadron  supervisor.  In  addition,  the  aircraft  must  be  cleared  by  a maintenance supervisor. 4.4.3.  With  any  sort  of  engine  malfunction  indication  (engine  still  running),  a  solo  student should fly a precautionary emergency landing. 4.4.4.  If  a  solo  student  experiences  an  engine  failure  (engine  shutdown  or  not  producing sufficient  power  to  sustain  level  flight),  serious  consideration  should  be  given  to  ejection. The student may attempt a forced landing with the following restriction: minimum LDA of 4,000 feet or heavy weight flaps up landing distance plus 500 feet, whichever is greater.  JOHN W.

FLIGHTS (OCF), AND FERRY FLIGHTS A2.1.  Restrictions and Requirements: A2.1.1.  FCFs  will  not  be  conducted  with  other  types  of  missions  except  FCF  pilot continuation training, FCF pilot upgrade training, or FCF pilot certification flights. All FCF requirements will be accomplished by an FCF pilot or an FCF pilot in training status with an FCF  IP  on  board.  The  operations  group  commander  may  authorize  a  T-6  IP  to  fly  with  an FCF pilot on board. (T-2) A2.1.2.  FCF  sorties  take  priority  over  other  types  of  flying.    The  FCF  pilot  is  the  final authority  on  the  appropriate  crew  compliment.    Unless  conducting  an  FCF  pilot  or  FCF  IP upgrade,  FCFs  and  OCFs  should  be  scheduled,  in  priority  order,  with  the  following  crew complement: (T-2). A2.1.2.1.  Two FCF pilots. A2.1.2.2.  One FCF pilot and one T-6 IP. A2.1.2.3.  Solo FCF pilot. A2.1.2.4.  If the desired crew compliment is not available; consider delaying the sortie to ensure the desired crew compliment is available. A2.1.3.  OCFs  will  normally  be  flown  by  FCF  pilots,  but  highly  experienced  non-FCF  IPs may perform OCF flights with the operations group commander’s approval. (T-2) A2.1.4.  IAW  T.O.  1-1-300,  FCFs  may  recover  at  home  station  when  originating  from auxiliary fields or from bases within the local flying area. (T-2) A2.1.5.  Aircraft within the local flying area requiring an FCF or OCF flight may be flown to the  home  station  by  an  FCF  pilot  or  crew  with  operations  group  commander  approval. Approval will be for a one-time ferry flight. (T-2) A2.1.6.  Maneuvers  not  in  accordance  with  TO  1T-6A-6CF-1,  Functional  Check  Flight Procedures Manual, will not be flown or practiced on FCF missions. (T-2) A2.1.7.  Local  FCF  pilots  or  crews  are  authorized  to  perform  required  FCFs  on  transient AETC aircraft if approved by the aircraft’s owning group commander. All FCFs on AETC T-6 aircraft will be flown  by  AETC  FCF pilots.  AETC FCF pilots  will not normally  perform FCFs on transient aircraft from other services or commands without specific approval from the group commander (or equivalent) that has control over the aircraft. A2.1.8.  To avoid entering IMC during an FCF sortie where OCF and/or spin recoveries are required, depending on the nature of the FCF, a minimum of 10,000 feet of airspace clear of clouds should exist below OCF or spin entry altitude. In addition, minimum weather should allow a line of sight to a suitable airfield within engine-out glide range.  AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 33 Attachment 3 T-6 MISSION BRIEFING GUIDE A3.1.

A7.1.  G-Awareness  Exercise.  Fly  the  G-awareness  exercise  in  airspace  that  is  free  from potential conflict and ensure adequate spacing between aircraft in formation. A7.2.  “Knock-It-Off” Situations.  “Knock it off” will be called when safety of flight is a factor or where doubt or confusion exists. Situations requiring a knock-it-off occur when: A7.2.1.  A dangerous situation is developing. A7.2.2.  Situational awareness is lost. A7.2.3.  A violation of any of the following has occurred or appears imminent: A7.2.3.1.  Area boundaries. A7.2.3.2.  Minimum cloud separation. A7.2.3.3.  Minimum altitude. A7.2.3.4.  Minimum range. A7.2.4.  Weather is below minimums for the area or route. A7.2.5.  Any aircraft exceeds maneuvering limits that compromise safety of flight (e.g., over-G, minimum airspeed). A7.2.6.  A radio failure is recognized or a continuous wing rock is observed. A7.2.7.  Bingo fuel is inadvertently overflown. A7.2.8.  An unbriefed or unscheduled flight enters the working area and is detrimental to the safe conduct of the mission. A7.2.9.  Any player calls “knock it off.” A7.2.10.  Aircraft flying extended trail breach the minimum range of 300 feet or are forward of the 3/9 line. A7.3.  “Knock-It-Off” Actions: A7.3.1.  Clear the flight path. A7.3.2.  Cease maneuvering and climb or descend to a safe altitude. A7.3.3.  Maintain visual. A7.3.4.  Acknowledge with a call sign. A7.4.  “Terminate”  Situations.  When safety of flight is not a factor, “terminate” will be used to discontinue maneuvering. A7.4.1.  Bingo fuel is reached. A7.4.2.  Desired learning objectives are met. AFI11-2T-6V3  18 JULY 2016 47 A7.4.3.  The aircraft is out of position (extended trail, offset maneuvering cone, wing work, etc.) with no expectation of an expeditious return to position. A7.4.4.  Any player calls “terminate.” A7.5.  “Terminate” Actions: A7.5.1.  Clear the flight path. A7.5.2.  Cease maneuvering and climb or descend to a safe altitude. A7.5.3.  Maintain visual. A7.5.4.  Acknowledge with a call sign. A7.6.  Minimum Altitudes: A7.6.1.  Extended trail levels I, II, and III: 6,000 feet AGL. A7.6.2.  Aerobatics or confidence maneuvers: 6,000 feet AGL. A7.6.3.  Stalls or slow flight: 6,000 feet AGL. A7.6.4.  Spins: 13,500 feet MSL, ensure spinning stops prior to 10,000 feet pressure altitude. A7.7.  Minimum Weather: A7.7.1.  Aerobatics,  confidence  maneuvers,  stalls,  and  extended  trail  levels  I,  II,  and  III: Clear of clouds with 3 miles in-flight visibility and a discernable horizon. A7.7.2.  Formation  Wing  Takeoff:  Circling  minimums,  or  500  feet  and  1  1/2  miles (whichever  is  higher).  15  knots  maximum  crosswind.  Runway  must  be  free  from  standing water, ice, slush, or snow. A7.7.3.  Formation Interval Takeoff: 1500 feet and 3 miles. A7.7.4.  Formation  approach  &  landing:  500  feet  and  1  1/2  miles  or  approach  minimums, whichever  is  higher.  15  knots  maximum  crosswind.  Runway  must  be  free  from  standing water, ice, slush, or snow. A7.8.  Lost Sight or “Blind.  ” The pilot flying the aircraft that loses sight will call “blind” and their altitude in MSL. The visual aircraft will assume formation deconfliction. Both aircraft will execute the following procedures: A7.8.1.  If  the  #1  aircraft  is  blind,  transmit  “CS,  blind,  XXXX  feet”  and  maintain  a predictable flight path. The #2 aircraft will either call “continue” and state his or her position, or call “knock-it-off” (as required) and blind with their altitude in MSL. A7.8.2.  If the #2 aircraft is blind, transmit “CS, blind, XXXX feet” and maneuver away from #1’s last known position. If visual, #1 will coordinate for a rejoin. A7.8.3.  If both aircraft have lost sight of each other, #1 must immediately direct a minimum of 1000 feet altitude separation.
