FEs will use the criteria contained in this volume for conducting all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations.  (T-2).  To ensure standard and objective evaluations, FEs will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.  (T-2). 1.5.2.  Prior  to  the  flight,  FEs  will  brief  the  examinee  on  the  conduct,  purpose,  and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria.  (T-2). 1.5.3.  FEs will not intentionally fail any equipment during flight evaluations, but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.  (T-2). 1.5.4.  The  FE  will  thoroughly  debrief/critique  all  aspects  of  the  flight.    (T-2).    During  the critique,  the  FE  will  review  the  examinee’s  specific  deviations,  area/sub  area  grades assigned, any additional training required and overall qualification level.  (T-2). 1.6.  Grading Instructions. 1.6.1.  Evaluations  are  graded  using  the  three-tier  area/subarea  grades  (Q/Q-/U)  and  the overall qualification level grading system (Q1/Q2/Q3). 1.6.2.  Every  reasonable  effort  should  be  made  to  evaluate  all  areas  in  flight.    Verbal evaluations  are  considered  alternate  methods  of  evaluations  and  are  documented  in  the Additional Comments portion of the AF Form 8. 1.6.2.1.  If an alternate evaluation method is used to satisfy a part of the ground or flight phase requirements, enter area number, area title, reason not accomplished in the normal method, alternate evaluation method used and date. 1.6.3.  FEs  will  use  the grading  criteria  in  this  volume  to  determine  individual  area/subarea grades.  (T-2).  FE judgment must be exercised when specific situations are not covered.  (T-2). 1.6.4.  Minor  momentary  deviations  are  acceptable,  provided  the  examinee  applies  prompt corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not  jeopardize  flight  safety.    Consider  cumulative deviations when determining the overall area/subarea grade. 1.7.  Unsatisfactory Performance. 1.7.1.  FE will not allow substandard performance to jeopardize safety of flight.  (T-2). 1.7.2.  If  at  any  time  the  FE  assumes  the  examinee’s  duties,  a  qualification  level  3  will  be assigned as the overall grade.  (T-2). 1.7.3.  A different FE will conduct rechecks.  (T-2). 1.7.4.  Flying  (i.e.  Touch  and  Go  (T&G),  Copilot  Air  Refueling  (CP  A/R),  etc)  certified individuals must demonstrate their ability to safely perform each maneuver and will perform it  during  the  evaluation.    (T-2).    If  performance  of  the  maneuver  is  not  acceptable,  the evaluator will recommend decertification to the SQ/CC.  (T-2). 6 AFI11-2E-8V2  3 OCTOBER 2017 Chapter 2 GROUND REQUISITES 2.1.  General.  Ground  requirements  for  instrument,  qualification  and  mission  evaluations  are listed in this chapter.

Instructor  Evaluations.  Instructors  are  evaluated  to  determine  their  judgment,  technical knowledge,  instructor  ability  (including  error  analysis  of  student  activity),  and  use  of  grading documents as well as proficiency in their aircrew specialty.  Initial instructor evaluations may be taken  in  conjunction  with  instrument/qualification/mission  evaluations  (EXCEPTION:  Initial instructor  evaluations in  conjunction  with qualification/mission evaluations). flight  engineer  cannot  be for taken 4.1.1.  Instructor  evaluations  may  be  conducted  with  actual  students  or  qualified crewmembers acting as students.  The evaluator may require the evaluatee to present verbal explanations  of  equipment  operations,  procedures  and  techniques  pertinent  to  their  crew position duties and responsibilities. 4.1.1.1.  Instructor  Pilot  Evaluations.    The  FE  will  ensure  instructor  evaluations  include an air refueling envelope demonstration accomplished in flight and instruction of at least one VFR pattern or instrument approach flown by another pilot.  (T-2). 4.1.1.1.1.  In Flight, the FE will ensure initial evaluations are administered with an IP or evaluator pilot in the pilot position and the examinee in the copilot position.  (T-2).  Recurring  evaluations  may  be  administered  with  a  student,  pilot,  copilot,  IP  or evaluator  occupying  the  other  pilot  position.    For  recurring  IP  evaluations,  the examinee may occupy either the pilot or copilot position unless a specific position is desired by the FE. 4.1.1.2.  Other  Aircrew  Instructor  Evaluations.    Instructor  flight  evaluations  will  be conducted  with  a  student  occupying  the  applicable  aircrew  position  whenever  possible.  The instructor examinee will monitor all phases of flight from an advantageous position and  be  prepared  to  demonstrate  or  explain  any  area  or  procedure.    (T-3).    The  FE  will particularly  note  the  instructor's  ability  to  recognize  student  difficulties  and  provide effective, timely corrective action.  (T-3). 4.1.2.  Recurring Evaluations.  Crewmembers designated as instructors will be evaluated on their  ability  to  instruct  during  all  recurring  evaluations.    (T-3).
