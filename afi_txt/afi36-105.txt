Servicing  Arrangements.  There  are  two  basic  types  of  personnel  servicing  agreements that  are  documented  in  a  host-tenant  support  agreement:  Intra-Service  and  Inter-Agency agreements.    Only  the  Inter-Agency  agreement  and  exceptions  to  the  Intra-Service  personnel servicing arrangements require a written personnel servicing agreement, both of which are to be coordinated by the applicable MAJCOM/A1(s) and AF/A1C prior to implementation. 1.2.  Support Agreements. 1.2.1.  Intra-Service  Civilian  Personnel  Servicing  Agreements  (CPSAs).  These  are  host-tenant  support  agreements  which  pertain  to  providing  civilian  personnel  services  for  Air Force employees.  Air Force Civilian Personnel Sections (CPSs) must service all Air Force civilian  employees  to  ensure  they  are  all  included  in  the  Air  Force  Civilian  Personnel Program (T-1). All Air Force activities collocated on an Air Force installation with a CPS, or within the same locality, are to be serviced by that CPS.  When an activity is not collocated or  located  near  a  CPS,  services  are  to  be  provided  by  the  nearest  CPS.    Civilian  personnel servicing  arrangements  that  follow  this  policy  do  not  require  documentation  in  an  Intra-Service CPSA.  Exceptions, however, may require an Intra-Service CPSA, depending on the circumstances.  MAJCOMs are to submit requests for exception to this policy to AF/A1C for approval, due to impact of civilian personnel servicing arrangements on Reduction in Force (RIF) retention and bargaining unit representation. This includes arrangements to centralize or decentralize civilian personnel servicing. 1.2.2.  Inter-Agency  Civilian  Personnel  Servicing  Agreements  (CPSAs).  These  are  host-tenant  support  agreements  which  pertain  to  providing  civilian  personnel  servicing  for  non-Air Force employees.  Air Force officials are to be receptive of other Department of Defense (DoD)  components  and  agencies  requesting  civilian  personnel  servicing  by  an  Air  Force CPS.    This  includes  civilian  personnel  servicing  under  the  Joint  Basing  Concept  of Operations  which  came  into  existence  with  the  issuance  of  the  2005  Defense  Base  Closure and Realignment Commission (DBCRC) Report to the President.  The Department of the Air Force,  when  serving  as  a  Combatant  Command  Support  Agent,  will  provide  civilian personnel administrative support to the combatant commands on a non-reimbursable basis as clarified  in  DODI  4000.19  and  in  AFPD  36-1  (T-0).  Inter-Agency  Support  Agreements identify the activity to be serviced, its location, and approximate number of employees. Any special responsibilities of the serviced and servicing activities are to be clearly defined. The servicing  MAJCOM/A1  is  to  coordinate  these  agreements  with  AF/A1C  before  final approval (T-0).  The staffing authorized and the reimbursement agreements are to be locally negotiated. 1.2.3.  Joint  Basing  Civilian  Personnel  Servicing  Agreements.    Any  servicing  agreements required  for  joint  basing  should  be  accomplished  via  the  Inter-Agency  CPSA  as  the  need arises with the respective Joint Base lead installation. 1.2.4.  Department  of  Defense  Instruction  (DoDI)  4000.19,  Support  Agreements,  details  the procedures  for  implementing  and  managing  support  agreements  in  DoD  when  it  concerns life-cycle  management  of  human  capital  for  the  appropriated  fund  civilian  workforce.  A   4  AFI36-105  19 OCTOBER 2015 support  agreement  outlining  civilian  personnel  servicing  is  documented  as  a  host-tenant support  agreement  on  a  Defense  Department  (DD)  Form  1144,  Support  Agreement  (used when reimbursables are included), a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), or a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), depending on the situation.  CPSs needing to establish a servicing agreement  are  to  work  with  their  Financial  Management  organization  to  ensure  that reimbursements  are  appropriately  identified  in  the  agreement,  as  necessary.    CPSs  are responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  support  agreement  is  written  in  the  suitable  format,  that  it appropriately  defines  the  scope  of  civilian  personnel  servicing,  and  that  it  is  signed  by  the proper signatory authorities, keeping in mind both MAJCOM/A1 and AF/A1C coordination and approval requirements (T-1). 1.2.5.  Both  servicing  and  serviced  activities  must  review  standard  CPSAs  every  three  (3) years (T-2).  Each party to a reimbursable agreement will review the agreement on an annual basis for financial impacts (T-2). AFI36-105  19 OCTOBER 2015   5  Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Civilian Force Management Directorate (AF/A1C) 2.1.1.  Approves  or  denies  exceptions  to  the  Air  Force  Intra-Service  civilian  personnel servicing policy. 2.1.2.  Whenever  a  DoD  Component  is  involved,  coordinates  on  Inter-Agency  civilian personnel servicing agreements before final approval. 2.2.  Major Command Personnel Director (MAJCOM/A1) 2.2.1.  Coordinates  on  Intra-Service  CPSAs  when  an  Air  Force  CPS  from  within  their command is involved. 2.2.2.  The owning MAJCOM/A1 coordinates CPSAs with other MAJCOM/A1s and obtains AF/A1C approval before final agreement signature and implementation. 2.3.  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC).  Coordinates  with  servicing  personnel  offices  to  execute agreements. 2.4.  Serviced  and  Servicing  Activities.  The  servicing  activity  drafts  CPSAs  following  the provisions of DoDI 4000.19 and submits to their MAJCOM/A1 for coordination, who will obtain approval  from  AF/A1C,  when  required.    Said  agreements  are  to  be  established  for  a  period  no greater than nine (9) years, with reviews conducted every one to three years (T-2), depending on whether or not reimbursables are included in the agreement.  If changes are required, works with the  appropriate  offices  to  incorporate  or  resolve  differences,  obtaining  necessary  coordination and approval signatures once revised.   6  AFI36-105  19 OCTOBER 2015 Chapter 3 AUTHORITY 3.1.  Designation  to  Act  for  Appointing  Authority.  An  official  of  the  serviced  agency,  who has specific delegated appointing authority from his own department for the group of employees involved, must issue formal authority to the Installation Civilian Personnel Officer providing the servicing to act for that individual in the administration of the civilian personnel program (T-0).  The  serviced  agency  cannot  delegate  the  basic  authority  to  effect  civilian  personnel  actions  to anyone outside of its agency or department. The Civilian Personnel Officer providing the service for another agency is to be designated, not delegated, this authority.  This written designation is to  be  in  writing  and  is  to  provide  for  administration  and  authentication  of  civilian  personnel actions. AFI36-105  19 OCTOBER 2015   7  Chapter 4 CRITERIA FOR CIVILIAN PERSONNEL SERVICING AGREEMENTS 4.1.  Content.  Civilian  personnel  servicing  normally  includes  administration  of  recruitment, staffing, affirmative employment, classification, RIF and for all DoD agencies, administration of the  DoD  Priority  Placement  Program,  compensation,  workforce  shaping,  employee  and  labor management relations, benefits, and retirement. In addition to the servicing criteria addressed by an agreement, it is to specifically provide for the following: 4.1.1.  Designation  of  an  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  (EEO)  Director  for  the  serviced activity. The Air Force will ensure civilian personnel servicing agreements are administered without unlawful discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, genetic information, or prior EEO activity. 4.1.2.  Indication  of  whether  grievance  and  appeals  procedures  of  the  servicing  or  serviced activity  will  be  followed.    In  the  interest  of  equal  treatment  for  all  employees  serviced,  the procedures of the servicing activity will be followed, except when factors such as the number or  geographic  location  of  the  employees  being  serviced  make  it  desirable  to  adopt  the procedures of the serviced activity. 4.1.3.  Indication  of  whether  the  recognized  labor  union  or  work  council  will  represent specified employees and if current collective bargaining agreements will apply. 4.1.4.  Indication  of  changes  in  Competitive  Area.  When  the  CPS  servicing  is  centralized, determine  if  the  employees  are  to  compete  for  retention  under  the  RIF  regulations  in  the same  or  separate  RIF  competitive  areas,  within  the  local  commuting  area.  The  RIF competitive area should be clearly defined and published for all employees and managers.  DANIEL R.
