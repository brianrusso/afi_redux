Sponsor name changes are established and reported from the uniformed Service or Agency to DEERS as a verified record.  See Term Verified Record.  The name change occurs within the human resource personnel system; an electronic data exchange to DEERS as an authoritative data feed, creating a verified record.  Family member name changes are updated directly by the VO in RAPIDS to DEERS. Refer to paragraph 1.29 and Table 1.23.   1.5.3. All paragraph numbers must end with a period. Use the eligibility data in DEERS or appropriate documents to verify eligibility, and issue  ID cards to eligible family members. 1.5.3.1.  Review and scan the Social Security card when prompted by the RAPIDS software when entering a person’s Social Security Number (SSN) in the RAPIDS application to the DEERS database, scan court order document, or scan other official government document that  specifically  states  the  number  is  a  SSN  when  entering  family  member’s  SSN  in  the RAPIDS application to the DEERS database. 1.5.3.1.1.  Do not enter or scan into RAPIDS an undocumented or incorrect SSN if the true  SSN  is  not  available.    Select  the  “none”  box  next  to  the  identifier  in  RAPIDS  to generate an appropriate ID Number as defined in paragraphs 1.5.3.1 and 1.22. 1.5.4.  Applicants enrolled in DEERS or applicants not enrolled in DEERS. If the applicant is enrolled  in  DEERS  and  unable  to  obtain  the  sponsor’s  signature  on  the  DD  Form  1172-2 (formerly  DD  Form  1172),  and  does  not  have  a  valid  general  or  special  power  of  attorney (POA), issue a temporary card for 30 days and cross reference paragraphs 2.4, 8.2, and Table 8.2.

Regardless of the individual's age or incapacitation, the SSM or VO shall determine if the individual  is  entitled  to  hospital  insurance  benefits  under  Medicare  Part  A,  Title  42  U.S.C., Chapter 7, Subchapter XVIII.  If entitled to insurance benefits under Title 42 U.S.C., Chapter 7, Subchapter  XVIII,  the  individual  is  ineligible  for  MC  under  TRICARE  unless  the  military sponsor  is  on  AD  except  as  provided  in  paragraph  7.1.  (T-0).      Spouses  or  children  of  AD sponsors do not lose their entitlement to the TRICARE because of the entitlement to insurance     AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 36  benefits under Title 42 U.S.C., Chapter 7, Subchapter XVIII.  To determine TRICARE eligibility for permanently incapacitated children over the age 21, a formal determination of eligibility for Medicare Part A benefits is obtained from the SSA and presented to the SSM or VO.  Individuals receiving Social Security disability compensation for 24 consecutive months are automatically entitled  to  Medicare  Part  A  hospital  insurance  benefits  under  Title  42  U.S.C.,  Chapter  7, Subchapter  XVIII,  effective  with  the  twenty-fifth  month  of  compensation.    All  ID  card applicants  are  asked  if  they  are  receiving  Social  Security  disability  benefits  and  when  the benefits  began  to  determine  TRICARE  eligibility.    If  Social  Security  disability  benefits  have been received for more than 24 months, TRICARE benefits are disallowed, unless purchasing Part B (supplemental insurance).  Individuals are not authorized TRICARE beyond attainment of age 65, unless the sponsor is on AD or the applicant presents a statement from the SSA certifying that the individual is not entitled to Medicare Part A hospital insurance benefits under Title 42 U.S.C.,  Chapter  7,  Subchapter  XVIII.    Exception:    Individuals  who  are  enrolled  in  Medicare Parts A and B are eligible for TRICARE For Life (TFL).  Refer to Chapter 24, paragraph 24.4.2.  The SSM or VO shall cite the documentation presented in DD Form 1172-2, block 21 (formerly DD Form 1172, section III, item 89), in addition to all other required documentation. (T-0).  1.5.7.  The SSM or VO should refer the applicant to the Social Security Administration (SSA) at 800-772-1213 or http://www.ssa.gov for general information and eligibility, if appropriate. 1.5.8.  VOs  should  review  weekly  the  Verifying  Official  Information  System  (VOIS)  at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/vois/index.jsp.    Refer  to  Service  specific  chapters  19-23  for additional information. 1.5.9. The VO enrolls eligible children (adoptive and pre-adoptive), step-children, and legal custody wards in DEERS even if no ID card is issued (refer to Attachments 5 and 20). 1.5.10. DoD Self-Service.  VOs can initiate a DoD Self-Service (DS) logon account for non-CAC holders.  The DS Logon is a logon credential that can be used across the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs for access to Self-Service applications such as the milConnect portal (http://milconnect.dmdc.mil), the VA/DoD's eBenefits website, some TRICARE Regional Contractor websites, TRICARE Online, and more. The DS logon account request occurs at the time of ID card issuance to family members.  The beneficiary is asked by the RAPIDS software application if he/she would like an account established.  Beneficiaries over the age of 18 are eligible.  Additionally, a CAC holding sponsor may request a DS logon for his/herself and / or for his/her eligible family members by accessing DS Access website at http://myaccess.dmdc.osd.mil/appj/dsaccess/.  Refer to the "Frequently Asked Questions" for more  details  about  the  DS  logon.    The  DS  Logon  is  associated  to  the  identities  of members/sponsors and their family members who are linked to the medical, pay and human resource systems as part of a global DoD managed identity program.    1.5.10.1.  DoD  Surrogate.    Surrogate  is  a  person  appointed  to  act  on  behalf  of  another individual; DoD Surrogacy allows an individual who may not be affiliated with the DoD and who may not be related to the DS Logon credential holder or eligible individual by a DoD-recognized family relationship to be granted access to a DS Logon credential holder’s or an eligible individual’s information.  Refer to AFI 36-3026, Volume 2, CAC, paragraph A12.8 milConnect for managing personal data and benefits for the DEERS program. AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   37 and contact information download view/update 1.5.11. ID Card Office Online Portal.  The ID Card Office Online (formerly, RAPIDS Self-Service  (RSS)  Portal  allows  eligible  populations  to  self-service  on  certain  actions  such  as update information in DEERS; add/change E-mail address to receive initial or new E-mail and E-mail certificates, add a Personnel Category Code (PCC) to the User Principle Name of the E-mail Signature Certificate, Activate the Personal Identity Verification (PIV) Authentication Certificate, at applications, https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/self_service.  1.5.12.  The ID Card Office Online Portal allows CAC recipients verify a family member's relationship and eligibility by digitally signing the DD Form 1172-2 for ID card reissuance.  When a DD Form 1172-2 is digitally-signed through Online Portal, the information is stored in DEERS and is a viewable document within RAPIDS. Once verified using Online Portal, sponsors no longer need to accompany their family members in obtaining the ID card.  Note:  Eligible family members may present a paper copy of the digitally signed DD Form 1172-2. When the digitally signed DD Form 1172-2 is presented, the Online Portal may reflect a red “X”  or  question  mark  “?”  displayed  in  block  22  (Sponsor/Employee  Signature).    This  is considered a valid form for issuing an ID card.  The DD Form 1172-2 digitally signed by a DoD Certificate Authority (CA) can serve as an electronic equivalent of a wet signature for DEERS purposes. 1.5.13. ID Card Office Online.  Includes a new feature by allowing CAC-carrying sponsors to request the addition of a new family member to their DEERS record.  Requires the sponsor to enter  new  family  member’s  demographic  and  relationship  information  as  a  conditional sponsorship untiled verified by the RAPIDS VO.  The Online Portal allows creation of the DD Form 1172-2 and stores it in DEERS.  This action allows the family member to visit a RAPIDS site without the sponsor to complete the verification process and receive an ID card if eligible. 1.5.14. Document Requests.  Documents scanned by a RAPIDS facility for the purposes of establishing identity and eligibility within DEERS may be requested by contacting DMDC at 1-800-361-2508  or  by  applying  on-line  with  the  DMDC  Data  Request  System  (DRS)  at https://www.dmdc.osd.mil/.  1.6.  Types of ID Cards and Who Can Carry Them.  The following tables provide eligibility information concerning issuance of each type of ID card.

NAF employees are eligible to receive a DoD/Uniformed Services Civilian Retiree ID card (plastic with no chip).  The VO is not able to add the Civilian Retiree personnel status to RAPIDS.    This  personnel  status  is  automatically  generated  from  the  Defense  Civilian Personnel Advisory Services upon termination of a NAF employee category due to retirement.  Note:  When an eligible DoD/Uniformed Service civilian qualify for retirement and the retiree record  is  not  listed  in  DEERS,  contact  the  Benefits  Workforce  &  Life  Program  Division (formerly  the  Civilian  Personnel  Management  System,  Field  Advisory  Services  Division (FAS),  Benefits  &  Entitlements  Branch  at  (703)  882-5197  for  verification  of  member’s federal retirement.

Providing Sample ID Cards to Government Agencies for Authorized Purposes.  The head of a state or local government agency or member of the Senior Executive Service of a Federal Agency may request sample ID cards for authorized purposes.  These purposes may include law enforcement training and counterfeit detection.  The requests are made in writing or E-mailed and clearly specify all intended use(s) and the duration of the use(s).  See Chapter 25 for appropriate office addresses and telephone numbers.    1.10.  Over-stamping.  Three over-stamps - TA, OVERSEAS ONLY and DUAL STATUS are applied to the ID card, DD Form 1173 and DD Form 2765, automatically by the RAPIDS application.  No other over-stamp is authorized and no exceptions or waivers are granted for ID cards.  See Chapter 15, DD Form 1173, Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card. 1.10.1. Nothing is placed on the ID card. 1.10.2. No holes are punched through the ID card.  (Note:  See Chapter 12, Table 12.2, Item 4, and Chapter 13, Table 13.2, Item 5). 1.10.3. No stickers or other adhesive materials are to be placed on either side of the ID card.  1.10.4. No materials are inserted between the card stock and the laminate for altering the ID card.  1.11.  Overseas Limitations.  Do not use treaties, status of forces agreements, military bases’ agreements, or other restrictions to determine privileges authorized.  Restrictions to privileges imposed on U.S. Uniformed Services, DoD civilian and contractor personnel and their families in foreign countries are enforced by other means, such as ration control systems used to limit commissary and exchange privileges.  1.12.    Issue  of  DD  Form  2764  in  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  Status.    Note:    If  at  a  RAPIDS facility,  issue  a  CAC.    The  CAC  is  the  Geneva  Conventions  Credential,  replacing  the  former USID type ID card, DD Form 2764 (Machine-readable card).  Individuals whose eligibility for privileges  is  based  on  TDY  are  not  issued  the  DD  Form  2764,  except  emergency  essential personnel  or  individuals  required  to  accompany  the  Uniformed  Services  in  support  of  a Congressional decree or Presidential commitment and essential contractor personnel and civilian noncombatant  personnel  who  are  deployed  in  conjunction  with  military  operations  overseas.  Note:    Presentation  of  travel  orders  and  a  picture  ID  constitutes  acceptable  ID.    Refer  to paragraph 17.11 and table 17.5.  1.13.  Disposition of DD Form 1172-2.  Effective 21 Sep 2011, issuing activities scanned the former DD Form 1172 on-site using the RAPIDS software.  Issuing offices may maintain DD Form 172-2 in a suspense file  for tracking temporary  ID  cards issued, pending final  action is taken  to  reissue  or  retrieve  the  card.    See  Table  9.3  Uniformed  Service  Representatives  for Retrieving  and  Disposing  of  ID  Cards  for  Members  Assigned  to  DoD  Regional  Correctional Facilities and Table 21.4 Air Force and Civilian Affiliate Categories for additional disposition instructions. 1.14.    Confiscating  ID  Cards.    ID  cards  are  government  property.    When  a  cardholder’s employment or affiliation is terminated, or the ID card is expired, fraudulently used or mutilated, AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   53 or  presented  by  a  person  not  entitled  to  its  use,  the  individuals  listed  in  Table  1.20  may confiscate ID cards under the following conditions:  Table 1.20.

See paragraph 1.14.1.  1.14.1.  The  cardholder  who  is  told  that  they  are  in  possession  of  an  ID  card  that  is questionable because the card is mutilated, expired, being used fraudulently, altered, etc., are advised that they may request a supervisor review the confiscation decision.  1.14.2.  The  individual  confiscating  the  card,  notifies  the  installation  security  authorities immediately after confiscating the ID card or if involved in a situation requiring confiscation. 1.14.3.  Installation security authorities investigate confiscation cases or refer these cases to the  appropriate  Service  Special  Agent  (SA)  or  investigative  office  (see  Attachment  1, Definitions) when it is warranted by circumstances or according to local procedures.   1.14.3.1.  Installation security authorities provide the parent Service the required information pertaining  to  the  situation  and  unresolved  report  when  the  confiscated  card  belongs  to  a member of another Service.    54   AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   1.14.3.2. The individual confiscating the ID card gives the cardholder a letter or receipt when confiscating an ID card.     1.14.3.3.  For  cases  involving  fraud,  misuse,  or  abuse  of  an  ID  card,  the  individual confiscating  the  ID  card  prepares  a  DD  Form  1569,  Incident/Complaint  Report  or  local form/report  (refer  to  Service  specific  Chapters  19-23  or  contact  respective  Uniformed Service DEERS Project Office in Chapter 25).    1.15.    Reissuing  Confiscated  ID  Cards.    The  installation  commander  or  authorized representative notifies the ID card issuing activity to reissue the ID card with appropriate benefits and suspended shopping privileges, if any.  The issuing activity will issue the ID card until the suspension end date as reflected in RAPIDS.  (T-3). 1.15.1.    Reissue  CAC  per  Chapter  9  for  members  being  processed  for  administrative  or judicial action, members court-martialed, placed in civilian or military confinement or placed on appellate review leave.  1.16.  Destroying Confiscated ID Cards, and Documenting Surrendered Cards, Receipts, and  Destruction  Certificates.    The  ID  card  issuing  activity  will  destroy  all  confiscated  and surrendered ID cards (with the exception of CACs), unless, they immediately return the card to the cardholder or the card is required pursuant to an investigation:  (T-3). 1.16.1.    The  ID  card  issuing  activity  documents  on  the  DD  Form  1172-2  information regarding cards that are not recovered (for example, when dependents are no longer eligible for benefits) on DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) (see Attachment 3).  Instruct the sponsor  to  mail  or  turn  in  the  dependent's  cards  that  are  not  recovered  to  the  separation activity.  Give a pre-addressed envelope to the sponsor. 1.16.2.  The  ID  card  issuing  activity  returns  confiscated  ID  cards  and  CACs  to  the  nearest RAPIDS facility or ID card issuing facility with the reason for confiscation.  1.17.  Administrative Record Lock.  If a DEERS record is administratively locked, the ID card issuing  activity  can  only  update  the  sponsor  or  family  member  address  element.    The  issuing activity  contacts  the  appropriate  Uniformed  Service  DEERS  Project  Office  (Active,  Guard, Reserve, or DoD agency as appropriate) or the DMDC Support Centers (DSCs) Helpdesks for further assistance.    1.18.  Invalid Entry in DEERS.  The DSC helpdesk resolves Invalid Entry Transactions (IET) in DEERS database for sponsors and family members when the conditions in Table 1.21.    Table 1.21.  When DSC Resolves Invalid Entries in DEERS. ITEM CONDITION 1 2 3 4 A duplicate DEERS record exists. A  collision  between  the  RAPIDS  personnel  category  and  or  condition  exists  that prevents issue of an ID card. Invalid  data  appears  in  a  DEERS  record  that  cannot  be  changed  using  the  RAPIDS update capability (e.g., when a stepchild is inappropriately listed as a child.) A beneficiary has never been eligible for ID card benefits and privileges.  The issuing AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   55 activity forwards a DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172), signed by the sponsor or VO (if sponsor is unable or unwilling to sign) with supporting documentation to the respective Service DEERS Project Office listed in Chapter 25.  1.19.  ID Cardholders Responsibilities.  The issuing activity advises ID cardholders to: 1.19.1. Carry their ID card at all times. 1.19.2.  Surrender  the  card  when  a  military  or  civilian  authority  requires  it  for  ID, investigation, when in confinement, upon discharge, or card expiration. 1.19.3. Attempt to retain ID card, if captured as a prisoner of war. 1.19.4.  Notify the ID card issuing activity when there is any change in their status which may affect  their  eligibility  to  ID  card  benefits  and  privileges  or  logical/physical  access.    Note:  Example of changes such as name, date of birth, and SSN, refer to Chapters 11-18).  1.20.  Pre-Deployment – National Guard/Reserve Alert Notification Period.   National Guard or  Reserve  sponsor  notification  of  activation  in  support  of  a  special  operation,  mobilization orders generated, and entered into service-specific systems for update to the DEERS database.  The notification date determines the start date of the Alert Notification Period and the effective date determines the start date of the AD condition.  The Alert Notification Period condition can last from 90 days up to 180 days, and ends the day before the AD condition starts in DEERS.  This  Alert  Notification  Period  condition  enables  the  sponsor  and  family  members  to  obtain TRICARE  benefits  for  up  to  180  days  prior  to  the  start  of  the  service  member's  mobilization orders.  1.20.1.  The  Guard/Reserve  Alert  Notification  Period  is  not  generated  from  the  RAPIDS application  to  the  DEERS  database,  thus,  RAPIDS  users  are  not  authorized  to  manually update contingency orders to the DEERS database.  Manually updating contingency orders in DEERS does not allow for automatic update of the Contingency Operation title and prohibits the  automatic  update  of  180  days  of  TAMP  benefits  at  the  time  of  the  sponsor’s demobilization.   1.20.2. RAPIDS users should not attempt to add the Guard/Reserve Alert Notification Period themselves , instead they should review the mobilizing member's DEERS record to determine if it has been updated by the service-specific systems.  If the member's DEERS record does not reflect the Guard/Reserve Alert Notification Period in 3 business days after mobilization orders have been created by their respective service-specific system, users should contact the sponsor’s Uniformed Service DEERS Project Office in Chapter 25. 1.21.  Period of Deployment-National Guard/Reserve Alert Notification Period.  Once the sponsor’s  AD  assignment  begins,  the  National  Guard/Reserve  Alert  Notification  Period  automatically terminates and the AD condition is automatically generated within the sponsor’s DEERS record. 1.21.1. Once the sponsor’s AD assignment ends (post-deployment), the TA-180 condition is automatically  generated  in  the  DEERS  record.    The  sponsor  and  eligible  family  members receive the same benefits that they received under the Reserve Alert Notification Period, as mentioned  above;  180  days  Medical  Care  (MC)  benefits,  including  2-years  shopping privileges  at  the  commissary,  exchange,  and  MWR  facilities.    See  chapter  6  for  TA-180 details.    56   AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 1.21.2. In the event that the TA-180 condition was not automatically generated in DEERS, the RAPIDS VO should verify the member’s  eligibility and  contact the appropriate Uniformed Service DEERS Project Office. 1.22.  Sponsors and Dependents During Mobilization or Wartime.  If the sponsor is deployed or mobilized for 31 or more days and is unavailable to sign a DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172), take the actions reflected in Table 1.22.  Note:  Reserve and National Guard family members are issued ID cards up to 14-days prior to sponsor’s AD reporting date.  If the AD 31 days or more condition is not listed in DEERS, update RAPIDS to reflect this condition based on the sponsor’s orders.  Table 1.22.  Processing Sponsors and Dependents During Mobilization or Wartime.  STEP ACTION 1 2 3 4 5 Verify dependent’s eligibility from the DEERS database or legal documentation.  Verify sponsor’s status and duration of deployment, or recall the information from one of the following sources:  DEERS database; Personnel Data System; Special order; A letter  from  personnel  office;  Official  E-mail  notification;  or  a  telephone  call  to  the sponsor’s  servicing  Personnel  office.    Note:    Do  not  reissue  ID  cards  to  sponsors  or family members when their current  cards have  not expired during simulated mobility exercises.  Use  Attachment  2  for  benefits  authorized  and  Attachment  4  for  DD  Form  1173 expiration and Medical TRICARE (MC) effective dates. Print DD Form 1172-2 and in block 21, list documentation used to verify the sponsor and dependent status. If the sponsor is unable to sign due to deployment or mobilization, state “Sponsor not available—deployed in support of (list operation). Update dependents in the DEERS database.    1.23.    90-day  Temporary  ID  Card  Issuance  for  Dependents.    Uniformed  Service  DEERS Project Office  may  authorize issuance of a  DD  Form 1173 for a 90-day period to dependents under extenuating circumstances. See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.5, Service specific Chapters 19-23 for additional information, and Chapter 25 for Service DEERS Project Offices for assistance. 1.23.1.  Undocumented  Dependent  Family  Members.    Undocumented  dependent  family member is enrolled in DEERS, and is not eligible for an ID card until two valid and unexpired identity documents are provided.  At least one of the two identity documents shall be a State or Federal Government issued picture ID. 1.23.2.  DD  Form  1172-2  Undocumented  Dependent  Family  Member.    VO  inserts  the following sponsor statement into block 21, “I am requesting enrollment of this dependent for benefit  eligibility  only.    I  acknowledge  an  ID  card  will  not  be  issued  until  two  valid  and unexpired identity documents are provided as required.” 1.23.3. Sponsor signs DD Form 1172-2, block 21, and VO scans the form in RAPIDS to the undocumented  dependent  family  member’s  record  to  DEERS.    Refer  to  paragraph  1.26, Temporary Identification Number (TIN) for DEERS beneficiaries awaiting an SSN.  AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   57 1.24.    Mandatory  Disclosure  of  Social  Security  Numbers  for  DEERS.    Congress  has authorized DoD to require mandatory disclosure of SSN of all beneficiaries of the Uniformed Services’ health care system (32 CFR part 220, Section 220.9).   Failure to disclose a SSN when enrolling in or updating DEERS results in loss of MC benefits in Military Treatment Facilities (MTF)  (See  paragraph  15.9).    However,  emergency  health  care  services  are  provided  to  the extent furnished members of the general public.   1.24.1. Effective 1 June 2011, ID cards issued from RAPIDS no longer prints SSNs.  In lieu of  the  9-digit  SSN,  a  10-digit  DoD  ID  number  is  the  identifier  for  all  ID  card  population categories and is printed on all IDs, including the CAC.  In addition, a 11-digit DoD Benefits number  is  printed  on  any  ID  when    an  individual  is  eligible  to  receive  DoD  benefits  as authorized  in  DEERS/RAPIDS  for  medical  benefits  and  shopping  privileges  e.g.,  MWR, Commissary, Exchange.  See Terms for DoD ID Number and DoD Benefit Number.    1.25.    Individual  Taxpayer  Identification  Number  (ITIN)  An  ITIN  is  used  when  a  foreign national  family  member  is  not  eligible  for  a  SSN  but  is  required  to  have  a  U.S.  taxpayer  ID number.    This  number  is  issued  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).    The  ITIN  permits continued medical eligibility in the MTF.    1.26.    Temporary  Identification  Number  (TIN)  A  TIN  is  a  system-generated  number automatically generated and assigned by the DEERS database for categories of beneficiaries who are  awaiting  an  SSN,  such  as  newborns  and  foreign  spouses  and  foreign  same-sex  marriage spouse or for those who do not have a SSN.  Note:  A TIN cannot be used to add a record from RAPIDS to the DEERS database for convenience of family members who have failed to provide SSN documentation or have misplaced it. 1.26.1.  A  foreign  national  who  is  a  spouse,  same-sex  marriage  spouse,  ,  child,  or  child  of same-sex marriage or same-sex partner of a U.S. citizen, and does not have a SSN or ITIN is issued a TIN while waiting for a SSN or ITIN.  Note:  A foreign national who is not eligible for a SSN or ITIN a FIN is generated from RAPIDS.  (Refer to paragraph 1.28). 1.26.2. TINs are a temporary means of identifying a beneficiary as a potential MTF patient in DEERS until receipt of a SSN, ITIN or a letter from the SSA or IRS, respectively, stating the family member is not eligible for either.  Note:  An individual with a TIN has three 90-day grace periods to acquire an SSN or ITIN, or to receive a letter from the SSA or the IRS stating non-eligibility to qualify.  1.26.3. Failure to acquire a SSN or ITIN renders the family member ineligible for continued MC within the MTFs.  Note:  The TIN is  not designed to be used as permanent identifier; however, if an eligible individual declines to apply for the SSN or acquire an ITIN, then, the TIN remains on the beneficiary record, and no direct MC is authorized from a MTF.   1.27.  Foreign Identification Number (FIN).  A FIN (a system-generated number assigned as F900-00-0000 and up) is automatically generated and assigned by DEERS to allow enrollment of eligible foreign military, foreign nationals and respective family members.  If sponsor or family members possess a SSN or ITIN, it is used in lieu of a FIN.  Note:  A FIN is not issued to a U.S. citizen spouse who is married to a foreign military or foreign national sponsor.  This also applies to same-sex marriage spouse.  In this instance, the U.S. citizen spouse uses their existing SSN or ITIN, if otherwise eligible for an identifier.      58   AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 1.27.1. In the absence of a SSN, a FIN is assigned to categories of NATO and non-NATO foreign  military  members  and  their  family  members,  and  to  foreign  nationals  employed  in positions overseas that result in DoD benefits and entitlements.   1.27.2. A FIN is assigned permanently for the term of the individual’s enrollment in DEERS unless they later acquire a SSN.  If the individual assigned the FIN later acquires an SSN, the DEERS record is updated using the SSN.  Note:  RAPIDS prevents the VO from updating a FIN to SSN in  DEERS.  The  VO forwards  a  copy of the SSN card to the DMDC Support Office, Research and Analysis for DEERS update.  See paragraph 25.2.    1.28.  Mandatory Collection of Fingerprints.  The 1997 Under Secretary of Defense (USD) Capture Fingerprint Policy Memorandum made it mandatory to capture electronically and store in DEERS, fingerprints of all eligible individuals in a pay or annuity status.  This includes Active and Reserve military personnel, retirees, survivors receiving annuity payments derived from the Service  of  a  deceased  person,  and  civilian  employees  with  ID  cards  issued  through  RAPIDS.  Individuals who refuse to have their fingerprint captured and stored are denied an ID card issued to  them.    Note:    See  paragraph  11.14  for  additional  information  when  processing  a  mail-in request. 1.28.1.  RAPIDS  Skip  Verification  of  Fingerprint.    Skip  verification  of  the  Primary  and Secondary  fingerprint  may  be  necessary  if  the  RAPIDS  VO  cannot  successfully  match  an individual’s  fingerprint  or  when  the  beneficiary  is  not  present.    The  Site  Security  Manager (SSM) can perform the skip fingerprint verification when a person’s identity can be verified through another means or is already positively identified.  See Chapter 10, paragraph 10.5.1.  1.29.    Name  Change  Based  on  Marriage  Certificate.    Marriage  certificate  is  sufficient  to legally change a spouse name in order to obtain a Federal passport or State driver’s license, and is an acceptable document for changing the name in DEERS.  Exception:  Military members who  are  married  to  a  military  member,  referred  to  as  Joint  Service  Marriage  (JSM),  the member’s military personnel record needs to be updated by the respective Service’s personnel data system to DEERS.  Once the name change occurs in DEERS, then, RAPIDS reflects this information.  See paragraph 1.5.2.1, Table 1.23, and Table A2.1.  Table 1.23.  Name Change Based on Marriage Certificate.   ITEM CONDITION 1 2 Identity Vetting – Dependent spouse is required to provide two forms of ID according to  FIPS  201-2  (formerly  I-9),  at  www.cac.mil,  Department  of  Defense  List  Of Acceptable Identity Documents.    IDs should vet the individual’s identity under either the maiden name or married name as indicated on the marriage certificate. If ID is vetted under the maiden name, marriage certificate provides:  Progression from maiden name to married name, and Documentation necessary to change name in DEERS, then, Issue ID card to spouse. AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   59 3 RAPIDS defaults to enroll the dependent spouse under sponsor’s last name, however, the spouse has the following options:  Take the sponsor’s last name, or Retain maiden name, or Take a hyphenated name.  Note:  For initial or subsequent DEERS enrollment, the marriage certificate is the only documentation needed to support the option chosen by the spouse.  For all other name change  requests,  refer  to  the  Uniformed  Services  Records  Office  of  Primary Responsibility (OPR) for further guidance.  1.30.  Roles  and  Responsibilities.    Uniformed  Services  DEERS  Project  Offices  and  RAPIDS issuing  sites  roles  will  implement  DEERS  enrollment  and  eligibility  policy  guidance  and procedures relating to ID card eligibility and issuance, including benefit entitlement eligibility impacting DEERS populations.  1.30.1.

HQMC (MMSR-6). HQMC (MMSR-6). HQMC (MMSR-6). HQMC (MMSR-6). 2.2.1. All paragraph numbers must end with a period.  Other activities may send waiver requests for ID card-issuing equipment to their Uniformed Services Personnel project office (active, Guard or Reserve, as appropriate) when unique circumstances exist (paragraph 25.1).  For example, request equipment for an issuing activity located in an area with a large retirement population and no Uniformed Services ID card issuing activity is located within a reasonable distance; or, for units with large numbers of assigned personnel.       2.2.1.1.  The Defense Manpower Data Center/Real Time Automated Personnel Identification System Program Office (DMDC/RAPIDS) is the final approval authority.    2.3.  What the Verifying Official (VO) Does.  Verifies a person’s identity and eligibility, and scans identity and eligibility documents into RAPIDS for DEERS.  VO establishes basic entitlements according to this instruction (also see paragraph 10.1), then, takes actions reflected in Table 2.2 when verifying eligibility for ID Cards:        AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   63 Table 2.2.  Actions Taken by DEERS/RAPIDS Verifying Official. STEP  ACTION 1 2 3 4 5 6 Review supporting documents listed in paragraph 2.4 and Attachment 5, or query the DEERS database via RAPIDS if person is properly enrolled; or   Contact DMDC to retrieve a previously scanned DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) if available, for enrollment verification. See paragraph 25.2. Accept properly verified faxed or a RAPIDS scanned DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172), or scanned DD1172-2 via an encrypted or password protected E-mail from a DEERS/RAPIDS VO.  If  administrative action is not coordinated before receipt of DD  Form  1172-2,  and  there  are  questions  concerning  the  verification,  or  information listed on block 21 remarks section, contact the sending VO. Contact  VO  to  confirm  eligibility  if  dependent  brings  in  faxed  DD  Form  1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172). Use Attachment 2 to determine the benefits and privileges authorized. Refer to Attachment 4 for information on how the effective and termination dates for Medical Civilian (MC) care (TRICARE) are established.   7  Manually prepared DD Form 1172-2 is completed according to Attachment 3. 8 Update  the  information  on  the  DD  Form  1172-2  (formerly  DD  Form  1172)  by  the RAPIDS or DEERS on-line systems.  Ensure appropriate remarks are included in block 21 (formerly block 89), reflecting the method of verification was accomplished, and the reason for the initial or new ID card.  Refer to Attachment 3, paragraph A3.5.  Ensure a copy of the Privacy Act statement is prominently displayed and have applicant read before signing the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172). 9 10 11  Give  the  original  copy  to  the  applicant  and  use  additional  copies  as  necessary  for dependency determinations, etc.).   13 12  Advise the applicant that the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) are valid for only 90 days after the VO signs.  Applications held longer are void. Forward one copy of the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) to the parent Service when renewing ID cards for permanently incapacitated children and former spouses of Navy, Marine Corps, NOAA, and USPHS members.  See paragraph 25.1 for addresses.  2.3.1.  The  RAPIDS  application  determines  benefits,  privileges,  and  Medical  Civilian  (MC) effective  dates  for  TRICARE  eligibility  according  to  the  DEERS  database.    This  system automates entitlement policy specified in public law and implementing publications.  Refer to Chapter 10. 2.3.2.  ID  card  sites  verify  and  issue  ID  cards  following  the  guidance  contained  in  this instruction and transmit DD Forms 1172 according to paragraph 1.13.  2.4.    Documentation  Required.    Refer  to  Attachment  5  to  determine  the  basic  identity  and eligibility  documentation  required.    The  VO  does  not  need  basic  individual’s  eligibility documentation  when  the  DEERS  database  can  verify  if  the  individual  otherwise  qualifies.  However,  the  individual’s  identity  is  verified  according  to  FIPS  201-2  (formerly  I-9),  at     AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 64  www.cac.mil, Department of Defense List Of Acceptable Identity Documents.  If the applicant is replacing a lost or stolen ID card and has no photo ID, his or her identity can be confirmed by the fingerprint or photo stored in DEERS.  Note:   RAPIDS biometric  SSM verification over-ride function  may  be  used  for  lost  or  stolen  ID  as  proof  of  identity  if  a  previous  photograph  is available in DEERS.  Refer FIPS 201-2 (formerly I-9), at www.cac.mil, Department of Defense List Of Acceptable Identity Documents for identity proofing DEERS enrollment, eligibility, and ID card issuance purposes. (T-0).  (See paragraphs 1.5.4, 2.4, Table 2.4, paragraph 8.2, Table 8.2 and Attachment 5, Note 8 in this instruction and AFI 36-3026, Volume 2, Attachment 10).  A letter of counseling is also an acceptable document for RAPIDS scanning when a lost occurrence is reported.  Example:  Not all inclusive, when a military member loses his or her CAC in a training environment. 2.4.1.  Marriage  certificates,  divorce  decrees,  and  birth  certificates  are  certified  originals, court-certified copies, or certified photocopies that reflect the file or case number.  VOs may request  additional  documents  if  validity  of  documents  provided  is  in  question.    (Reference Attachment 5, Note 7)   2.4.1.1.  View  a  Social  Security  card,  letter  from  the  SSA,  or  other  official  government document that specifically states the number is a SSN when entering family member’s SSNs in the DEERS and RAPIDS application.  Truncated SSN is not acceptable for verification or for  RAPIDS  data  entry  to  create,  update,  or  change  an  individual’s  record  in  the  DEERS database.  A complete nine-digit number (divided into three parts, separated with a hyphen) from SSA is required for DEERS purposes.   2.4.1.2.  A  valid  general  or  special  power  of  attorney  is  acceptable  when  sponsor  is  not present  to  sign  for  a  family  member’s  DEERS  enrollment,  ID  card  application,  or  ID  card issuance.    Contact  your  local  legal  office  to  determine  validity  of  document  if  needed  (see Attachment 3, A3.5.2.).   2.4.2. Special documentation required for common law marriages.  Common law marriages are only accepted if the couple is from a state that recognizes common law marriages.  Follow the instructions below to determine eligibility for common law marriages:   2.4.2.1.  Common law marriages require the sponsor or spouse to prove to the satisfaction of the  local  legal  authority  that  the  relationship  is  valid  (e.g.,  tax  returns,  bank  statements, statements  from  disinterested  parties  attesting  the  couple  was  holding  themselves  out  as husband and wife).  Note:  Navy and Marine Corps members must send documentation to establish a common law marriage, an Indian Tribal marriage or a marriage that is contracted subsequent to a foreign divorce to the following offices as appropriate:  Navy:  NPC PERS 24; Marine Corps:  HQMC (MFP-1 or MMSR-6, see paragraph 25.1).  A copy of the original complaint should be provided in all cases involving a final decree of annulment.   2.4.2.2.  Common law marriage.  In each case where the eligibility of a spouse is established on  the  validity  of  common  law  marriage,  a  review  by  the  local  legal  office  is  required  to determine legal sufficiency. The legal office can attest to the apparent legality of state court documentation, including common law affidavit, establishing the validity of a common law marriage.    Common  law  marriages  ending  in  divorce  see  Chapter  3.    Exception:    See paragraph 2.4.2.1 for Navy and Marine Corps members. 2.4.3. Passports.  Do not accept a passport by itself when a person is applying for enrollment in DEERS; however, when used in conjunction with another form of ID, a passport may be AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   65 used  as  acceptable  photo  ID.    Exception:    Passports  may  be  accepted  for  dependents  of foreign  military  personnel,  because  such  dependents  need  legal  document  in  order  to accompany  the  member  to  the  United  States.    Note:    RAPIDS  biometric  SSM  verification over-ride function may be used as proof of identity if a previous photograph is available in DEERS.   2.4.4.  Foreign  Documents.   The  following  provides  instructions  concerning  foreign documents.    English  translations  must  accompany  all  foreign  documents.    Translation  is accomplished by a neutral third party, avoiding conflict of person’s self-interest, professional interest,  or  public  trust.    Sponsors  or  family  members  are  prohibited  from  translating  their own  documents.    For  verifying  foreign  document  authentications,  refer  to  Attachment  5, Notes 7.1 and 7.1.1.    2.4.4.1.  Foreign divorce decrees. In each case where the eligibility of a spouse or family member is based on the validity of a foreign divorce, and submitted for ID card termination in DEERS, a review by the local legal office is required for legal sufficiency.  Exception:  See paragraph  2.4.2.1  for  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  members  and  Table  2.3  for  Coast  Guard members.   2.4.4.1.1.  Do not accept a foreign divorce decree for such purposes until the legal staffs verify the document’s validity.          2.4.4.1.2.    If  the  validity  of  a  foreign  divorce  decree  is  of  doubtful,  a  U.S.  court  must declare  the  divorce  valid  before  the  sponsor  uses  the  decree  to  begin  or  end  ID  card entitlements.  Foreign divorce decrees are reviewed by local legal offices, if legal services are available.    2.4.4.1.3.

Procedures for Issuing Temporary DD Forms 2765, 1173, 1173-1.  IF ENROLLED IN DEERS: Issue  a  temporary  card  for  up  to  90  days  until  the applicant  can  obtain  legal  documentation  or  the sponsor’s  signature  if  reasonably  sure  the  person  is entitled.  A dependency determination  for  renewal  (over  50  percent  support) may  be  issued  a  temporary  card  up  to  90  days  if expiration  of  the  ID  card  would  interrupt  MC.  Issuance  of  a  90-day  temporary  ID  card  issuance  is permitted renewal applicants only (refer to Chapter 4, Table 4.6, Step 2).  Sponsor must certify in block 21 (formerly DD Form 1172 block 89) of the DD Form 1172-2 that he or she is financially responsible for any MC the dependent received  since  expiration  of  the  ID  card  should  the dependency  determination  be  disapproved.  (T-3). Refer to Chapter 4, and Service specific procedures. IF NOT ENROLLED IN DEERS: Do  not  issue  a  temporary  card,  unless approved  by the  parent  Uniformed Services DEERS Project Office.    Issue a 90-day temporary ID card reflecting a TIN to beneficiaries who do not yet have a SSN or ITIN (i.e., foreign spouses and their children, foreign same-sex marriage spouses, and their children) and enroll beneficiary in DEERS.  If applicant has applied to the SSA but has not yet received a SSN or ITIN, issue another 90-day card.   for  permanent incapacitated a  2.5.2. VOs take the steps listed in Table 2.5 when issuing temporary DD Forms 2765, 1173, or 1173-1:  Table 2.5.  Steps to Take When Issuing Temporary DD Forms 2765, 1173, 1173-1.  STEP ACTION 1 2 3 4 5 6 Review legal documentation or DEERS database, or both. Prepare the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) and update the DEERS.  File  the  DD  Form  1172-2  (formerly  DD  Form  1172)  in  suspense  file  based  on expiration date. Start retrieval action if the sponsor does not bring in documentation to apply for a full term ID card by the date the temporary ID card expires. Update DEERS to reflect ineligibility for the period that the temporary card covers.   Follow  normal  verifying  and  issuing  procedures  when  the  sponsor  presents  adequate AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   67 documentation.  2.6.  Indefinite ID Card For Permanently Disabled Family Member.  Public Law 109-364 with the FY 2007 Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) authorize the Uniformed Services to issue ID cards without an established expiration date to those family members who are permanently disabled.  The financial dependency determination at a minimum is renewed every 4-years.  In the  case  of  deceased  sponsors,  the  approved  financial  dependency  determination  currently  in effect or accomplished at the time of the member’s death, may be used for subsequent renewals.  Note:    Family  members  who  no  longer  qualify  as  a  dependent  under  Title  10,  Chapter  55, Section 1072 based on relationship changes, e.g., spouse divorce or remarriage, children, step-children, legal custody ward with a disapproved dependency determinations for incapacitation, or becoming a sponsor no longer qualify in retaining a permanent ID card.  The card is returned to the nearest uniformed Services RAPIDS facility.  2.6.1.  Permanently  incapacitated  spouses  retired  service  members  only  are  eligible  for  an indefinite Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege card (DD Form 1173) at any age as long as they are Medicare eligible due to disability or end-stage renal disease and reported by the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  to  DMDC  for  DEERS  update.    Note:    Further assistance  in  verifying  family  member  enrollment  status  in  DEERS,  contact  the  DMDC Beneficiary  Helpdesk at 1-800-538-9552 when  a family member or end-stage renal disease information is not reflective in RAPIDS.  2.7.  New ID Card Expiration Dates for Retired Military Members and Their Spouses.  In late 2012, DoD changed the issuance policy and relating RAPIDS software to adjust how the expiration date is reflected on a military retiree and spouse ID cards (for more information, see Tables 12.1, 13.1, 14.1 and 15.1). 2.7.1.  ID  cards  for  spouses  of  retired  Uniformed  Service  members  are  issued  with  an expiration date 5 years from the date of issuance when the cardholder turns 65 years old.  ID cards  for  spouses  of  retired  Uniformed  Service  members  are  issued  with  an  indefinite expiration  date  when  the  cardholder  turns  75  years.    Eligible  unremarried  spouses, unremarried former spouses, surviving spouses are also eligible for the 5-year and indefinite ID card.  2.8.  Personnel Data Reporting to DEERS.  Personnel data reporting to the DEERS database includes  automated  data  extracted  from  various  uniformed  Services  reporting  systems.  Additional data reporting also includes the uniformed Services medical and finance systems, and other  DoD  and  Federal  agency  reporting’s.    Depending  on  the  population  category,  military personnel  records  for  enlisted  and  officer,  data  submission  to  the  Defense  Manpower  Data Center (DMDC) includes corrections and changes to members’ enrollment in DEERS according to DoDI 1336.05, “Automated Extract of Active Duty Military Personnel Records,” and DoDI 7730.54, “Reserve Component Common Personnel Data System (RCCPDS).”   2.8.1. Common personnel data corrections and changes include and not limited to:  (1) Name, (2) Social Security Number (SSN), (3) Date of Birth (DOB), (4) Citizenship, and (5) Gender (Sex).  Note:  Uniformed Services transgender personnel data reporting is accomplished according to DoDI 1300.28, “In-Service Transition for Transgender Service Members for Active Duty, National Guard, and  Reserve  Components.    Retired  uniformed  Services  members  and  dependent  family  members    68    AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 gender change requests, refer to Chapter 25, Uniformed Services DEERS/RAPIDS Project Offices for further assistance. 2.8.2.  Reporting manner of death.  Reporting manner of death for a DEERS beneficiary is through the RAPIDS application and scanning the document to the DEERS database.  AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   69  Chapter 3   UNIFORMED SERVICES DOD BENEFICIAIRES (FORMER SPOUSES) 3.1.    General  Information.    When  a  divorce  occurs,  the  parent  Uniformed  Service  will accomplish  the  initial  eligibility  verification  for  the  DoD  Beneficiary  (ex-spouse)  should  they apply for a determination.  A determination of eligibility for former spouse ID card benefits and privileges is not automatic, however, the request for a determination of eligibility may originate from  the  member  (sponsor)  or  a  divorced  spouse.  (T-2).    Refer  to  Table  1.3,  Categories  of Personnel  Who  Can  Not  Be  Cross-Serviced  and  paragraph  3.11  for  Army  National  Guard members and spouses who are divorced.  The Uniformed Services Former Spouses Protection Act (USFSPA) provides  ID  card benefits and privileges to several categories of DoD Beneficiaries (DBs), referred to as unremarried former spouses (see Attachment 1, Terms).  Note:  Chapter 3 information does apply to Same-Sex Marriage Spouses.  When a divorced spouse does not qualify for former spouse benefits, see paragraph 3.10 for non-qualifying DB.  This chapter also defines the categories of DBs and provides eligibility criteria and verification procedures for ID cards.  The  chapter  also  includes  eligibility  criteria  for  DBs  who  qualify  for  ID  card  benefits  and privileges as abused dependents.  Also see Chapter 5, Abused Dependents.  When the member and  his  or  her  spouse  are  living  apart  because  of  a  legal  separation  or  interlocutory  decree  of divorce, set the ID card expiration date at 1 year from the date of issue or the date on which the divorce becomes final.  Refer to Chapter 15, paragraph 15.1.4, and Chapter 16, paragraph 16.1.4. 3.1.1. Effective 1 October 2003, eligible Uniformed Service Former Spouses are enrolled in DEERS in the category designator of DoD Beneficiary (DB); and issued a DD Form 2765, Department of Defense/Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card.  Note:  A DB cannot  convey,  qualify,  or  extend  eligibility  of  benefits  or  privileges  for  the  purposes  of DEERS sponsorship to family members, e.g. grandchildren or legal custody ward, etc., refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.1.5.

Specific sponsor responsibilities refer to Chapter 8 and Attachment 2 for further  details  on  entitlements.    The  sponsor  is  a  DoD/uniformed  services  military,  federal civilian, contractor, or military affiliate (non-U.S citizen).  The DEERS eligibility is based on the sponsor’s  affiliation  to  DoD/uniformed  Services;  to  include  qualifying  dependent  family members.    Dependent  family  members  and  their  DEERS  eligibility  are  based  upon  their relationship to the sponsor.  In this instance, the sponsor qualifies his or her dependent child for DEERS eligibility according to this instruction, leading to medical benefits, shopping privileges, and ID card issuance.  Children ID cards are issued at age 10.  See paragraph 4.4 for ID card issuance  under  age  10,  paragraph  4.20  and  Table  4.15  concerning  step-children  eligibility.  Exception:  Effective January 1, 2011, TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) Program authorizes MC only (no shopping privileges), up to age 26.  The ID card is valid for the duration of the TYA period or 4 years from the date the VO verified the record in RAPIDS, whichever comes first.  For  eligibility  and  enrollment  details,  visit  the  local  TRICARE  Service  Center  (TSC), http://www.tricare.mil or TRICARE regional contractors - North 1-877-874-2273, South 1-800-444-5445,  West  1-888-874-9378,  Eurasi-Africa    +44-20-8762-8384,  Latin  America  &  Canada +1-215-942-8393, or Pacific +61-2-9273-2710. 4.1.1. Children born during the course of marriage.  Uniformed Service members’ children are entitled to MC as a matter established by law, including DEERS enrollment, and issuance of an ID card.  Qualifying children are enrolled in DEERS if otherwise meeting eligibility requirements  according  to  paragraph  4.1,  (refer  to  Chapter  8  on  sponsor  responsibilities, unwilling and unable to verify dependent family member DEERS enrollment and eligibility).  Eligibility  for  DEERS  is  determined  in  10  U.S.C.  1072,  DoDI  1000.13,  DoDM  1000.13, Volumes 1, 2 and 3, including this instruction.  If the child’s DEERS eligibility status is in question of legitimacy and under the age 21, then eligibility is verified by the birth certificate according  paragraph  4.1.1.    Note:    Paternity  tests  alone  for  children  born  out  of  wedlock (parents  not  married)  are  not  recognized  for  a  child’s  DEERS  eligibility  and  enrollment, unless,  accompanied  by  court  order,  identifying  paternity  to  the  member/sponsor  (see paragraph  4.9).    When  a  child  is  born  during  the  marriage,  and  the  legitimacy  remains  in question, the member (sponsor) may (1) pursue a legal paternity determination through an execution  of  court  order,  or  (2)  termination  of  marriage;  e.g.,  divorce  in  court,  stating  no child was born during the course of marriage, or (3) the court order decrees termination of the  sponsor’s  parental  rights  (refer to  Attachment  5  for  eligibility  and  required documentation, and paragraphs 4.1.3 and 4.1.6).  These court order related actions terminate the parent/child relationship, ending a child DEERS eligibility and discontinues the DEERS enrollment (refer to Chapter 8 in notifying affected parties). AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   81 4.1.2.  When  a  child  continues  to  meet  the  qualifications  as  a  sponsor’s  dependent  family member and is in a military Reserve Component not on AD for 31 days or more, they remain eligible for an ID card as a dependent.  Refer to Tables 13.1 and 15.1 (DD Form 1173, DD Form 2 Reserve, or CAC).  Children who join the uniformed Service and subsequently are separated from the Service, and are under age 21, or under age 23 and attending an institution of higher learning as a full-time student, remain eligible for an ID card as a dependent.  Refer to paragraphs 4.1, 4.5, Chapter 8, Tables 8.1 and 8.2 in establishing eligibility and DEERS enrollment.  When a child marries and divorces or obtains a legal annulment and under age 21,  or  under  age  23  and  attending  an  institution  of  higher  learning  as  a  full-time  student, remains eligible for DEERS reinstatement and  ID card issuance, including eligibility to the TRICARE Young Adult (TYA) program, if otherwise meeting qualifications to the program.  See  paragraph  4.1,  Exception  for  further  information  and  Term,  Institution  of  Higher Learning. 4.1.3.  Adoption  or  Emancipation  of  children  under  age  21.    If  a  child  is  adopted  and  the relationship  is  severed  to  the  sponsor,  the  child’s  eligibility  to  DEERS  is  terminated.    In general,  emancipation  (child  turning  age  18)  has  no  effect  on  children’s  continued  DEERS eligibility;  or  to  an  ID  card  reflecting  medical  benefits  as  established  by  10  U.S.C.  1072, including shopping privileges, if meeting certain qualifying conditions within this instruction.  However, should an order or appropriate document from a court of competent jurisdiction in the  U.S.  (or  U.S.  Territories  or  Possessions),  affirm  either  the  voluntary  relinquishment  or involuntary  termination  of  parental  rights  and  placing  the  child  into  custody  of  another guardian, or emancipating the child, the child’s eligibility to DEERS is terminated, including eligibility to an ID card.  (See Attachment 1, Terms for Adopted Child or Emancipation, and Attachment  2  for  entitlements).    Also  see  paragraph  4.1.6  for  Termination  of  DEERS Enrollment and Eligibility when a court-order is provided, and the sponsor relinquishes their parental rights. 4.1.4. Children who become eligible for other health insurance (OHI) under provisions of the State and Federal program termed "Medicaid" remain eligible and enrolled in DEERS with eligibility to TRICARE benefits.  In this instance, coordination of Medicaid health insurance and TRICARE benefits is considered for children.  Also see paragraph 4.1.6 for Termination of  DEERS  Enrollment  and  Eligibility  when  a  court-order  is  provided,  and  the  sponsor relinquishes  their  parental  rights.    DMDC  has  a  Federal  Case  Registry  (FCR)  used  for matching  all  state  child  support  agencies  (Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services)  that have access to DEERS, confirming medical eligibility.  This confirmation process is based on the National Medical Support Notice (NMSN) to DMDC in support of 45 CFR 303.32(a) for enforcement of health care coverage.  Questions concerning the NMSN and Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) refer to a beneficiary counselor at a MTF and for coordination of TRICARE benefits and Medicaid health insurance. 4.1.5. Children who have no relationship to the sponsor at the time of the sponsor’s death, who  later  become  adopted  or  a  legal  custody  ward  of  the  widow  or  widower  (who  are considered  DoD  Beneficiaries),  cannot  qualify  a  child  for  DEERS  enrollment  or  for  the purposes of receiving ID card benefits and privileges, including eligibility to the TRICARE Young  Adult  (TYA)  program.    Exception:    DEERS  eligibility  for  a  child  can  only  be established  if  it  can  be  proven  by  a  court  order  or  to  the  satisfaction  by  the  Staff  Judge    82   AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 Advocate (SJA) the deceased sponsor supported the adoption or legal custody ward process prior to his or her death. 4.1.6. Termination of DEERS Enrollment and Eligibility. Unmarried children are entitled to receive MC up to age 21.  See paragraph 4.1.  Exception:   When a court-order is provided, reflecting  parental  rights  are  voluntary  terminated,  the  child’s  DEERS  enrollment  ceases, including  eligibility  to  benefits  and  privileges  along  with  the  ID  card  being  terminated  in DEERS.  If a court order is provided and reflects involuntary parental rights termination, the local legal office is contacted for determination of terminating a child’s DEERS enrollment and eligibility to benefits and privileges, including the termination of the ID card.  Local legal office may refer the case of DEERS termination to their respective command headquarters for further  legal  review.    When  the  parent  Service’s  legal  community  is  unable  to  make  a determination for terminating a child’s DEERS eligibility, then, the legal review is sent to the Defense Human Resource Activity, General Counsel for final a determination. 4.1.7.  Death  of  child  (stillborn).    Enroll  child  in  DEERS  for  the  purposes  of  establishing survivorship entitlements.      4.2.  Dual Entitlement for Children.  A child (including adopted, surviving child, or step-child) of a military member who is also an eligible family member of another military member may be issued an ID card with either member as a sponsor.  Exception:  Wards cannot be an eligible dependent  of  any  other  member  or  a  former  member  within  the  DEERS  program.    (Refer  to Term, Ward).  A child may not possess more than one ID card (DD Forms 1173 or 1173-1).  A child may be enrolled in DEERS under more than one sponsor but may not actively receive dual benefits from more than one sponsor at the same time regardless if an ID card is issued.  Note:  This allows all family members to be enrolled under a single sponsorship for medical eligibility, accessibility,  and  a  single  TRICARE  deductible  purpose.    Military  and  civilian  members involved are to decide which one sponsors the child for DEERS enrollment, and if appropriate, ID card issuance. 4.2.1. If the members are unwilling or unable to agree on the child’s sponsorship in DEERS, take the action reflected in Table 4.1:   Table 4.1.  Action Required When Military Members Can’t Agree Who is going to Sponsor the Child In DEERS.  THEN Do not enroll, update, or make changes to the child’s DEERS record without the consent of the military spouse or same-sex marriage spouse.  Note:  The consent or presentation of Power of Attorney (POA) is documented on the DD Form 1172-2, block 21, remarks. Enroll child under such member. IF THE MEMBER Is  married  to  a  military  member,  Joint Service  Marriage  (JSM),  or  in  a  same-sex marriage, and is deployed or not available.

If  none  of occurred. the  above  conditions  have Is unable or unwilling, or No  Contact  Order  or  Restraining  Order  is issued by a court. 83 Enroll the child where the child resides.  Inform members no change in sponsorship can occur  until  there  is  a  court  order,  designating the  primary  member  for  sponsorship,  or  the two  sponsors  can  agree  to  the  transfer  of DEERS sponsorship (in the best interests of the child for receiving benefits). Refer to Chapter 8 and paragraph 8.3, or Consult with local installation legal services or contact  respective  Services  DEERS  Project Office as listed in Chapter 25.  4.2.2. Authorize all benefits and privileges and annotate the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172), block 21, explaining child’s dual enrollment and sponsorship in DEERS. 4.2.3.  Notify  the  sponsors  involved  when  moving  the  family  member  from  one  sponsor’s DEERS record to another involving the transfer of benefits and privileges, including ID card issuance.  See Chapter 8 and Table 8.2.  4.3.  Initial Enrollment of Newborns.  Enrollment should be accomplished as soon as practical and  within  30  days  of  birth.    Immediate  enrollment  should  preclude  delays  in  acquiring necessary medical appointments for the newborn.  Note:  A placeholder record is created by the Manage Care Support Contractor (MCSC) for newborn DEERS enrollment up to 60-days after a child’s birth.  The 60-day period allows time for the sponsor to present a birth certificate and or SSN (if eligible) for the DEERS program.  A visit by the sponsor with the appropriate document is always the encouraged method of enrollment.  The sponsor should consider contacting their respective DoD/uniformed Services personnel office prior to the birth to acquire phone numbers and a mailing address to use in the event a timely visit becomes impractical.    Presentation of source  documents  by  the  sponsor  or  requestor  may  be  accomplished  as  stated  in  Table  4.2.  Exception:    Children  born  out  of  wedlock  are  processed  according  to  enrollment  instructions listed in paragraphs 4.9 and 4.10.  Table 4.2.  Initial Enrollment of Newborns.

Questionable  documentation should  be referred  to  the  local  JA.    Once  resolved,  the eligibility  end  date  is  updated  to  the  21st birthday. 2.    A  child’s  SSN  is  presented  for  DEERS update  as  soon  as  acquired.    See  paragraph 1.24 on mandatory disclosure of the SSN.  4.4.  ID Card Eligibility for Children Under Age 10.  Issue an ID card to a child under 10 years of age if one of the conditions reflected in Table 4.3 occurs.  All eligible family members (except children under the age of  18) are required to provide two identity source document FIPS 201-2  (formerly  I-9),  at  www.cac.mil,  Department  of  Defense  List  Of  Acceptable  Identity Documents  during  the  DoD  ID  card  issuance  process.    See  Attachment  5  for  basic documentation eligibility.  Note:  Children under the age of 18 applying for a dependent ID card are only required to provide documentation for the initial verification of eligibility or proof of relationship to the sponsor.  Identity documentation requirements are derived from the I-9 and should not be confused with Title 10 benefits eligibility age limits. 4.4.1. Eligibility documentation listed in Attachment 5 is scanned into the DEERS database for all eligible family members, including children under age 10.    Table 4.3.  Conditions for Issue of ID Cards to Children Under Age 10.  ITEM CONDITION The  child’s  temporary  guardian  lives  away  from  the  parent’s  or  same-sex  marriage spouse’s duty station and uses a medical facility other than the one keeping the child’s records; or the child resides temporarily away from the sponsor or same-sex marriage spouse or there is no eligible spouse.  Authorize ID card benefits and privileges according to Attachment 2.   The child is of a joint service couple (includes same-sex marriage spouses) or a single parent. The child’s physical appearance warrants issue (for example, appears older than 10).    The child does not reside in the household of an eligible adult family member.   The Personnel Chief or designated representative such as the RAPIDS Super Verifying Official/Site Security Manager (SVO/SSM) approves or disapproves requests based on unique circumstances.

See Attachment 8.  Sponsor  certifies  in  block  21  on  the  DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) that he or she is providing over 50 percent of the student’s support.  4.6.    Incapacitated  Children  Over  Age  21  (Initial  Application).    Table  4.5  defines  the eligibility  criteria,  required  documentation  for initial  application,  and  approved documentation required to issue ID cards to incapacitated children over age 21.  This information applies for military dependent children only and does not apply to DoD civilian and contractor dependents or dependent children of a honorably discharged veterans rated 100-percent disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA).  Documentation provided from the civilian and contractor  human  resource  or  personnel  offices,  including  the  Department  of  Veteran  Affairs, indicating  verification  of  the  child’s  incapacitation  is  provided  to  the  member.    Note:    The incapacitation must have occurred prior to the child’s 21st birthday.  Also refer to paragraph 4.6.3 for redetermination of permanent incapacitation application. the 4.6.1.  The  military  sponsor’s  parent  service  must  process  initial  and  renewal  dependency applications (when there is no previous dependency approval) for all incapacitated children as cross-servicing is not authorized (refer to Table 1.3 and paragraph 2.6). (T-2).  The DD Form 137-5,  Dependency  Statement  –  Incapacitated  Child  Over  Age  21,  includes  space  for  the second sponsor to be identified and considered for the purposes of dependency.  When both sponsors  are  identified  on  this  form,  the  child  may  be  moved  back  and  forth  between  the sponsors for the DEERS program.  If the DD Form 137-5 does not include both sponsors, a new financial determination that considers either the second sponsor or both sponsors together needs to be submitted.  Should an incapacitated child marry, and subsequently the marriage ends in divorce or death of the spouse, a new financial dependency determination is required to  renew  the  child’s  DEERS  eligibility.    Note:    See  paragraph  2.6  indefinite  ID  card  for permanently  disabled  family  member  and  Chapters  19-23  for  Service-specific  dependency determination processing procedures to the appropriate personnel or finance agency for final approval or disapproval.  The financial dependency determination at a minimum is renewed every  4-years.    In  the  case  of  deceased  sponsors,  the  approved  financial  dependency determination currently in effect or accomplished at the time of the member’s death, may be used for subsequent renewals. 4.6.2. When issuing the ID card to an incapacitated child, the individual may sign the ID card or the RAPIDS VO may enter the letters “INCAP” when the individual cannot sign because of a mental or physical incapacity. 4.6.3.  Incapacitation  Redeterminations.    DoD  continues  to  make  program  changes  to  the existing incapacitation application process.  Future changes incorporate new web supported applications, using the milConnect portal for processing determinations of eligibility with E-mail and U.S. postal service auto notifications to the sponsor, surviving family members, or appointed  agent. the   Successful  migration  of  future  web  applications  supporting AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   89 incapacitation dependency program requires coordination, collaboration among the uniformed Services RAPIDS facilities and DoD agencies.  Note:  Sponsors who have a current financial dependency determination recorded in their child’s DEERS record, may qualify to complete their  four-year  redetermination  requirement  by  answering  three  questions  about  their incapacitated  dependent  through:    (1)  milConnect,  (2)  visiting  in  person  to  the  nearest uniformed Services ID card issuing facility, or (3) by mail.  Should a child’s DEERS record reflect no current approved financial dependency determination or DEERS is missing data to complete the redetermination online with milConnect or in person at a RAPIDS facility; then, the sponsor must submit a new application to the appropriate uniformed Service personnel or finance  office  for  obtaining  an  approval.    If  the  child’s  DEERS  record  is  missing  the incapacitation data, the three questions to satisfy the redetermination process will not appear in the milConnect portal or RAPIDS.  Further information, contact the appropriate uniformed Services DEERS Project Office in Chapter 25.   4.6.4.  Shopping Privileges for  Incapacitated Child Over Age 21 or 23.   DoD  continues to improve existing programs.  DoD has extended shopping privileges to children who are older than  21-23  if  the  incapacitation  occurred  after  ages  21-23  and  the  child(ren)  do  not  meet eligibility criteria within this instruction according to paragraphs 4.6 - 4.8.  This includes the establishment of a child's eligibility when the relationship to the sponsor did not begin prior to the  child  reaching  age  21  or  23.

Sponsor Responsibilities.  Military members are sponsors in their own right, and have the responsibility  to  report  within  30  days  any  family  member  additions  or  changes  to  DEERS.    Note:  This responsibility also applies to Joint Service Marriage (JSM) sponsors and Same-Sex Marriage Spouses. This also includes the DEERS enrollment of a military spouse, Joint Service Marriage  (JSM), including same-sex marriage spouse and their child, Active, National Guard, and Reserve members, including eligible civilian and contractor populations when qualifying for DEERS enrollment and disenrollment.  See paragraph 8.1.1 on sponsor responsibilities.  Table 8.1 identifies the sponsor’s responsibilities concerning DEERS enrollment, issue of their family member’s ID cards, requirements for DEERS termination, retrieval requirements.  The specific procedures and sequence of order followed within this chapter varies based on the sponsor and family  member  affiliation  with  DoD/uniformed  Services  and  type  of  ID  card  issued  due  to eligibility or revocation due to loss of eligibility.      Table 8.1.  Active, Retired, National Guard, Reserve, Civilian, Contractor, and Other Eligible Sponsors’ Responsibilities.  ITEM 1 2 3 4  RESPONSIBILITIES Advise  the  nearest  Uniformed  Service  issuing  facility  of  any  family  member additions or changes to dependent data that affect DEERS enrollment or eligibility for a DD Form 1173 or DD Form 1173-1 within 30 days of the addition or change.  Additions  or  changes  to  DEERS  records,  see  Attachment  5  and  www.cac.mil  for acceptable  documents.    Sponsor  will  sign  DD  Form  1172-2  (formerly  DD  Form 1172),  application  relating  to  DD  Forms  1173  or  1173-1  to  verify  continued eligibility  for dependents upon  ID card reissuance. (T-3).     Exception:  When a family member is age 75 or older the DD Form 1173, reflects an “indefinite” card expiration date.   Provide documentation to update DEERS for family members no longer entitled to benefits  and  privileges  within  30  days  of  the  change,  (for  example,  final  divorce decree,  child’s  marriage  certificate.).    Family  members  cannot  be  removed  from DEERS  upon  the  personal  request  of  the  sponsor  or  the  family  member  without documentation to terminate the relationship.  See Table 8.3 and Attachment 5 for appropriate documentation requirements.  Note:  If the sponsor fails to terminate an ineligible dependent, and the dependent presents legal documentation, a termination is accomplished.    Retrieve ID cards from dependents no longer eligible and surrender the cards to the nearest ID card issuing activity within 30 days of the loss of eligibility.   Ensure  all  addresses  are  kept  current  in  DEERS.    It  is  mandatory  that  all  Active, Guard, and Reserve personnel update their residential address in DEERS within 30 days  of  a  residential  move  per  USD  (P&R)  memorandum,  10  October  1997,     AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017  120  5 Implementing  Section  363  of  the  Personal  Responsibility  and  Work  Opportunity Reconciliation  Act  of  1996).    Note:    Members  in  CONUS  residing  on  military installations in dormitories will provide their building number and room number as their residential address. (T-3).  Service members, permanently assigned OCONUS to a vessel, or to routinely deployable units, or whose residential address the Service Secretary  determines  should  not  be  disclosed  due  to  national  security  or  safety concerns, provide a duty address.  Provide family members’ eligibility documentation, not limited to SSNs, marriage and  birth  certificates,  including  identity  documentation  when  enrolling  in  DEERS (see  paragraphs  1.21.  and  15.9).   Presentation  of  eligibility  and  identity documentation is scanned via RAPIDS to DEERS (see Attachments 5 and 20).  8.1.1.  Active,  Retired,  National  Guard,  Reserve,  Civilian,  Contractor,  and  Other  Eligible Sponsors Responsibilities:  Sponsorship incorporates the processes for confirming eligibility for an ID card.  The sponsor is the person affiliated with the DoD/uniformed Services or other Federal agency who takes responsibility for verifying and authorizing the applicant’s need for an  ID  card  according  DoDI  1000.13,  August  31,  2013.    Applicants  for  a  CAC  must  be sponsored by a DoD government official or employee, refer to AFI 36-3026, Volume 2.  8.1.2. Sponsor may not deny or revoke benefits and privileges, or issuance of an ID for an eligible dependent without appropriate legal documentation as listed in Attachment 5.     8.1.2.1.    Emancipation  of  a  dependent  child  under  age  21  has  no  effect  on  the  child’s entitlement  to  ID  card  benefits  and  privileges,  if  he  or  she  is  otherwise  entitled.    Refer  to Chapter 4.    8.2.  Sponsor Unable or Unwilling to Enroll Eligible Family Members in DEERS or Sign the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172).  When a sponsor is unable or unwilling to enroll eligible family members in DEERS or sign the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172), follow the steps reflected in Table 8.2.  Table 8.2.  Processing Procedures when Sponsor is Unable or Unwilling to Enroll Eligible Family Members in DEERS or Sign the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172).  STEP ACTION 1 2 VO  verifies  eligibility  within  DEERS  or  by  provided  documentation,  and  issues temporary ID card(s) for 30 days with appropriate benefits.

Note:  Record of communication, whether it is by telephone, email, in person,  or  letter  between  VO  and  sponsor  is  recommended  for  processing  DEERS determination of eligibility, enrollment/termination, and ID card issuance (See Table 8.3).  AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   121 3 4 5 6 7 8 VO annotates on the on DD Form 1172-2 in block 21 (formerly DD Form 1172, block 89),  “The  sponsor  is  unwilling  or  unable  to  enroll  eligible  family  members  or terminate ineligible family members in DEERS , or to sign the DD Form 1172-2.”  If the sponsor does not respond in 30 days, take the appropriate action to enroll eligible family members or terminate ineligible family members in DEERS or issue ID cards with  a  new  expiration  date  per  Attachment  4,  or  confiscate  ID  cards  for  ineligible family  members.    Cite  paragraph  8.2,  including  legal  documentation  on  DD  Form 1172-2, block 21 (formerly the DD form 1172, block 89) as authority for enrolling or issuing the ID card(s) for eligible family member(s), or terminating DEERS eligibility. For legal documentation, e.g.,  court-order of paternity  (see Attachment  5 and Table 8.3). Extend benefits and privileges according to Attachment 2. Extend  privileges  according  to  paragraph  16.1  to  family  members  of  Guard  and Reserve members who are unwilling or unable to sign.  Cite paragraph 8.2 in block 21 for  the  DD  Form  1172-2  (formerly  block  89  for  the  DD  Form  1172),  legal documentation and as authority for issuing the ID cards. VO annotates DD Form 1172-2, block 21 (formerly signs the DD Form 1172 in block 99).  Cite paragraph 8.2 in block 21 (formerly block 89) including legal documentation on DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) for issuing the ID cards. Update the DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) in DEERS.   Scan DD Form 1172-2 (formerly DD Form 1172) into RAPIDS for DEERS.  8.3.  Processing Procedures for No Contact or Restraining Orders.  A No Contact Order or Restraining Order has no effect on denying a person’s eligibility, enrollment, or ID card issuance when  otherwise  qualifying  within  this  instruction.    Verify  eligibility  within  DEERS  or  by documentation  provided,  verify  the  DD  Form  1172-2  and  state  in  block  21,  “The  member  is unable to sign due to court order.”  Issue ID card with a new expiration date per Attachment 4.  RAPIDS  VOs  may  contact  local  installation  legal  offices  to  review  a  No  Contact  Order  or Restraining Order.  For further assistance, contact the Parent Service DEERS Project Office (see Chapter 25).   8.3.1. Processing Procedures for Family Member’s Whose Eligibility is in Question.

Exception:    Refer  Marine  Corps  dependents  to  the  HQMC  MFP-1  or  MMSR-6,  as appropriate.  8.4.    Terminating  or  Revoking  Family  Member’s  Eligibility  for  ID  Cards.    Table  8.3 identifies  categories  of  individuals  who  lose  eligibility  and  when  VOs  should  terminate eligibility  in  DEERS.    Note:    Refer  Coast  Guard  sponsors  and  family  members  to  the  Coast Guard DEERS Project Office, see paragraph 25.1.5. 8.4.1. Do not terminate eligibility for those individuals in paragraphs 5.1, 5.3, 6.1, 6.4, and 6.6.  Note:  Do not terminate eligibility of family members when the sponsor is a Prisoner of War  (POW),  Missing  in  Action  (MIA),  in  an  Absent  Without  Leave  (AWOL)  status,  or unauthorized absence status.  AWOL members remain eligible for ID cards until the date the sponsor is placed in deserter status; resulting in family member loss of DEERS eligibility for benefits and privileges.

Since 1997, RAPIDS uses rules based methodology to automate entitlement policy specified in public law, and implement regulations and directives.  This methodology: 10.1.1. Takes entitlement decisions out of the hands of local RAPIDS VOs based on the rules based methodology in the DEERS database.   10.1.2.  Provides  a  standard  Graphical  User  Interface  (GUI)  environment  for  identity credentialing,  and  in  2008,  began  scanning  of  eligibility  and  identity  documents  for entitlement verification, and ID card issuance. 10.1.3. Furnishes robust Help Screens to support day-to-day customer service operations.   10.2.  Specialized Functionality and Platforms for RAPIDS.  RAPIDS consist of software and hardware  components  used  to  update  DEERS  and  issue  machine-readable  ID  cards  and  DD Form  1172-2  as  prescribed  by  this  instruction.

Sharing of CAC, Personal Identification Number (PIN), or biometric information is prohibited.  This includes sharing access to RAPIDS via logon or password, and is punishable according to USC Title 18, Section 499.  10.11.7.  Physical  Security.    Access  to  RAPIDS  equipment  shall  be  restricted  to  authorized users and the equipment is protected in accordance with standard procedures for protecting expensive, pilferable consumer electronic products.  Use of RAPIDS for other than official business, particularly access and downloading software programs from the internet containing malicious code or surfing inappropriate web sites is a serious security risk to networks and network devices.  Use of RAPIDS as with any DoD system, constitutes consent to monitoring.  Note:    Evidence  of  misuse  collected  during  monitoring  may  be  used  for  administrative, criminal, or adverse actions.  Unauthorized or fraudulent use of this system may result in fines or imprisonment, or both as prescribed by 18 U.S.C. 499, 506, 509, 701, and 1001.  (T-0).   10.12.

No stickers or other adhesive materials are placed on either side of the CAC.  No holes are punched into the CAC.  The chip or laminate may not be removed or insertion of materials between the card stock and the laminate is prohibited; doing so would be considered  defacing  the  CAC.    Defacing  the  CAC  affects  the  validity  of  the  CAC  and  its applications.  Note:  Individuals are issued a separate CAC or ID card in each category for which they qualify.  Possession of a duplicate CAC or ID card in the same category is prohibited.   12.2.1.

Common Access Card (CAC) issuance to employees of Other Federal Agencies when performing duties with the Coast Guard: AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017  23.8.1.  In  accordance  with  DoD  Directive-Type  Memorandum  (DTM)  08-003.  “Next Generation  CAC  Implementation  Guidance,”  Incorporating  Change  5,  October  8,  2013, employees  of  other  government  agencies  (non-DoD  and  non-Coast  Guard  federal  civilians, state employees, or local governmental officials) may be eligible for a CAC. 23.8.2. Determination of eligibility is based on type and frequency of access to Coast Guard facilities,  DoD  facilities,  or  networks  necessary  to  effectively  support  the  authorizing organization’s mission.  The sponsoring Coast Guard organization must determine eligibility and ensure actions listed in Table 23.4 are completed prior to record creation in the TASS, formerly CVS, and CAC issuance.  Questions regarding eligibility and procedures should be directed to the Service DEERS Project Officer reflected in paragraph 25.1.5.   Table 23.4.  Eligibility and Procedural Requirements for CAC Issuance to Employees of Other Federal Agencies when Performing Duties with the U.S. Coast Guard.  STEP PROCEDURE 1 2 3 Coast Guard sponsors will use the policy contained in this manual and the following references to determine the necessity and eligibility for CAC issuance to non-Coast Guard personnel:  1.  DoD Directive Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-003, “Next Generation CAC Implementation Guidance,” Incorporating Change 5, October 8, 2013.  2.  Defense Human Resources Activity Headquarters Memo, “DEERS/RAPIDS Lock Down for Additional Populations” dated 29 Oct 2010. 3.   Personnel Security and Suitability Program, COMDTINST M5520.12C. 4.  Security and Information Assurance Manual, COMDTINST M5500.13C. Sponsoring Coast Guard organizations must nominate a command representative to become the sponsor’s TASS Trusted Agent (TA).  The designated representative must complete the TASS TA training and designation process.  Note:  DEERS/RAPIDS site security managers (SSMs), verification officials (VOs), or the Coast Guard DEERS/RAPIDS Project Officer cannot be designated as a TASS Trusted Agent Security Manager (TASM) or TA. Prior  to  the  creation  of  a  record  in  TASS  and  issuance  of  a  CAC  to  an  employee  of another federal agency, the employee’s Coast Guard sponsor must determine: 1.  The employee will perform duties that require issuance of a CAC: a.  The  individual  requires  both  access  to  a  Coast  Guard  or  DoD  facility  and access to Coast Guard or DoD networks either on site or remotely or b.  The individual requires remote access to Coast Guard or DoD networks that use only the CAC logon for user authentication. 2.  The employee has proof of his/her claimed identity.  All personnel must present two forms of ID source documents in the documents original form: a.  The  ID  source  documents  come  from  FIPS  201-2  (formerly  I-9),  at Identity www.cac.mil,  Department  of  Defense  List  Of  Acceptable AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   205 Documents. b.  At least one document from the FIPS 201-2 list is a valid (unexpired) State or Federal Government-issued picture ID. The photo ID requirement cannot be waived.  3.  The  employee  has  completed  the  required  background  vetting  per  the  Coast Guard Personnel Security and Suitability Program.  At a minimum, a completed FBI  fingerprint  check  with  favorable  results  and  submission  of  a  National Agency Check with Inquiries (NAC/I) is required.  Note: A CAC is not authorized for a period less than 30 days. A short-term logon user name  and  password  for  access  to  the  Coast  Guard’s  network  may  be  issued  for individuals performing duties for a period of less than 30 days.   Upon CAC issuance, the employee must compete the following prior to accessing the Coast Guard Data Network (CGOne): 1.  Information systems Security (ISS) Training,  2.  Automated Information Systems (AIS) User Acknowledgement Form  (CG-5500a), and 4 5 3.  DHS Non-Disclosure Agreement form (DHS Form 11000-6(08-04).  Upon completion of the employee’s assignment with the Coast Guard, the sponsoring organization’s TASS TA will ensure: 1.  Collection and proper disposition of the CAC that was issued to the individual, 2.  Access to CG Standard Workstation, CGOne, and DHS/DoD System [including Common Access Card Remote Access Service (CACRAS)] is revoked, 3.  All government files, documents, and government furnished property (laptop, USB hard drive, cell phone, etc.) are returned to the U.S. Coast Guard,  4.  The employee’s name is removed from any United States Coast Guard (USCG) Access List (Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET)/Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), etc.), and 5.  The  employee  signs  a  DHS  Non-Disclosure  Agreement  Form  (DHS  Form 11000-6(08-04),  23.9.  Renewal of Common Access Card (CAC) for employees of Other Federal Agencies:  23.9.1.    If  an  employee’s  duties  with  the  Coast  Guard  continue  after  the  original  expected termination date, the sponsor’s TASS TA must once again verify that all requirements listed above have been met and update the record in TASS.  A new CAC may be issued after the record has been updated.   23.10.  Coast Guard Security and Accountability of Armed Forces Identification Cards: Coast Guard issuing facilities ensure that unused CAC, non-Integrated Circuit Chip (ICC), and USID  card  stock  is  stored  in  a  locked  area.

USPHS  Temporary  Promotions.    The  PHS  Commissioned  Corps  has  two  types  of grades  and  therefore  two  types  of  promotions:    permanent  and  temporary.    An  officer’s permanent grade is mandated by law and is initially based on creditable training and experience.  Promotions  in  the  permanent  grade  are  subsequently  based  on  years  of  service.    An  officer’s temporary grade is also initially based on creditable training and experience, time in service and time in grade; however  promotions in temporary grade may at times occur without respect to years of service in order to meet the needs of the mission of the agency to which the officer is assigned.    By  law,  an  officer  is  required  to  hold  a  temporary  grade  for  at  least  1  year  before he/she  is  eligible  for  promotion  to  the  equivalent  permanent  grade;  consequently  an  officer’s temporary grade is always equal to or higher than his permanent grade.  The temporary grade determines an officer’s rank and pay.  When presented with a PHS Promotion Order, the issuing or VO may update DEERS based on the temporary grade or highest rank reflected on the order.  Questions  should  be  directed the  Service  Project  Officer  at  (240)  453-6131  or phsdeersgibill@hhs.gov.  23.16.  USPHS.  Incapacitated Children Over Age 21 (All Applications): to 23.16.1.

Members Entitled to Retired Pay Versus Honorably Discharged Veterans Rated 100-Percent Disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA).  The following information explains  the  difference  between  members  entitled  to  retired  pay  and  honorably  discharged veterans rated 100-percent disabled by the DVA.  24.1.1. Members Entitled To Retired Pay.  There is a lot of confusion concerning the status of members who are entitled to retired pay but also rated 100-percent disabled by the DVA for compensation purposes.  The key to the member’s status is the fact that the member is entitled to retired pay: 24.1.2.  Some  individuals  may  choose  to  waive  their  retired  pay  to  receive  “tax-exempt” disability  compensation  from  the  DVA  as  it  is  more  advantageous  for  monetary  reasons; however, this has no effect on their entitlement to a DD Form 2, Retired (Blue) ID card: 24.1.3. The member should be reflected in retired status in DEERS and issued the DD Form 2 Retired. 24.1.4.  Their  eligible  dependents  are  issued  the  DD  Form  1173  reflecting  eligibility  to TRICARE, MC in Uniformed Services MTFs, including commissary, exchange, and MWR privileges.  Note:  The DVA will determine eligibility for a dependent parent, parent-in-law, stepparent,  or  parent-by-adoption  of  a  DAV.    No  dependency  determination  application  is submitted to the uniformed Services personnel or finance offices for approval (see paragraph 24.2.5). 24.1.5.  Some  dependents  may  erroneously  be  in  receipt  of  medical  benefits  through  the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA); however,  when  the  member  is  in  a  retired  status  (entitled  to  retired  pay),  entitlement  to TRICARE prevails over CHAMPVA.  24.2.    Honorably  “Discharged”  Veterans  Rated  100-percent  Disabled  by  the  DVA.  Honorably  discharged  veterans  who  are  not  entitled  to  retired  pay,  and  rated  100-percent disabled  from  a  Uniformed  Service-connected  injury  or  disease.    The  DVA  Regional  Offices generate a veteran’s eligibility letter.  The eligibility letter content is often dependent upon the information entered by the Regional Office case worker. As a result, variations occur among the DVA  Regional  Office  letters  provided  to  an  eligible  veteran  and  presented  to  RAPIDS SSMs/VOs;  these  eligibility  letters  may  not  necessarily  conform  to  the  guidance  within  this instruction, including the sample template letter in Attachment 20.  Note:  See paragraphs 24.4 and 24.7 for members who received less than other honorable discharge. 24.2.1. In order for an eligible veteran to receive an ID card from the DoD/uniformed Services issuing facilities, a letter from the DVA certifies that the veteran is entitled to commissary and exchange privileges, and indicates whether a medical reevaluation is necessary. 24.2.2.  Presentation  of  posthumous  determinations,  indicating  the  100  percent  disability award  to  the  deceased  veteran  is  made  available  to  surviving  spouses,  same-sex  marriage spouses, and dependents.  See paragraph 24.2.2.      210   AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 24.2.3. One specific area of confusion occurs when a Disabled Veteran (DAV) seeks to obtain 100%  DAV  status  and  the  associated  DD  Form  2765,  Department  of  Defense/Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card.  An eligible veteran may present a total disability rating  less  than  100%,  but  is  determined  to  be  unemployable  (compensation  based  on unemployability,  see  paragraph  24.2.4).    This  situation  applies  to  veterans  who  are  on  the PDRL as well as those who are on the TDRL.    24.2.4. Veterans who are determined to be unemployable by the DVA, shall be enrolled in DEERS as 100% DAV (DAVTMP or DAVPRM), even if the DVA eligibility letter shows a total disability rating less than 100%.  (T-0).  Terminology and letter format used by the DVA that RAPIDS SSMs/VO's may see in the eligibility letter, qualifying a veteran for 100% DAV status for DEERS are: 24.2.5. 100-perecent disabled from a service-connected injury or disease, or 24.2.6. 100% disabled, or 24.2.7. Unemployable, or 24.2.8.  Individually  unemployable.  Note:  Commissary,  Exchange  and  MWR  benefits  are authorized for all former members enrolled as 100% disabled, even if not specifically stated in the VA letter.  24.3.    USD  P&R  Memorandum,  May  7,  2008,  Commissary  and  Exchange  Access  by Surviving  Spouses  and  Dependents  of  Honorable  Discharged  Veterans  Posthumously Determined 100 Percent Disabled.   Memorandum authorizes access to military commissary and exchange shopping privileges for surviving spouses and dependents of honorably discharged veterans  who  are  posthumously  determined  to  have  possessed  service-connected  disabilities rated as 100 percent. 24.3.1. A General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions.  A Honorable discharge is required in order for veteran (who is rated 100 percent disabled) to qualify for DEERS enrollment and for ID card issuance.  A General discharge (under honorable conditions) is not considered an Honorable discharge.  Therefore, veterans who are rated 100 percent disabled with a General discharge under honorable conditions do not qualify for DEERS enrollment, including their family  members,  or  an  ID  card  issued  from  RAPIDS;  reference  DoDI  1332.14,  Enlisted Administrative  Separation,  (Enclosure  4),  paragraph  3,  Characterization  of  Service  or Description  of  Separation,  subparagraph  b  Characterization  of  Service,  (2)  Types  of Characterization. 24.3.2.  Additionally,  veterans  (both  enlisted  and  officer)  who  receive  less  than  other honorable  discharge  for  any  period  of  service,  e.g.,  dishonorable,  other  than  honorable,  or uncharacterized  (unknown),  they  and  their  family  members  are  not  eligible  for  DEERS enrollment or ID card issuance.  Furthermore, members who received an honorable discharge from  one  branch  of  service,  and  subsequently,  served  with  another  branch  of  service,  and receive a discharge less  than honorable, they and their family members  are not eligible for DEERS enrollment or ID card issuance. 24.3.3.  Letters  from  the  DVA  that  indicate  the  veteran  has  been  awarded  100  percent disability compensation based on unemployability is acceptable.  Eligible family members are entitled to the DD Form 1173 reflecting shopping privileges only.  See paragraph 24.2.5. AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   211 24.3.4.  These  individuals  and  their  family  members  are  not  entitled  to  TRICARE  or  MC through the Uniformed Services MTFs and receive their medical benefits through the Civilian Health  and  Medical  Program,  Department  of  Veteran  Affairs  (DVA).    See  Attachment  2, Tables A2.11 and A2.12. 24.3.5. A copy of a DD Form 214 reflecting an honorable discharge is also required.  24.4.  General Information about TRICARE and Medicare, Part A.  Both TRICARE and the SSA  Medicare  Part  A  Hospital  Insurance  are  government-sponsored  health  benefits  programs prescribed by federal law.  An individual may not receive both benefits unless they are disabled, under age 65, or are eligible for Medicare at or over age 65 and enrolled in Part A and Part B of Medicare or are an AD dependent over age 65.  Note:  Information and eligibility concerning Social Security benefits may be obtained by contacting the SSA (See paragraph 25.5).  24.5.  TRICARE.  TRICARE  Eligibility  for  AD  Dependents.    Title  10,  United  States  Code, Section  1079,  authorizes  an  insurance  plan  through  which  care  could  be  obtained  through civilian sources.  This section of law permits continuation of TRICARE when an AD spouse or child are entitled to benefits under Medicare, Part A Hospital insurance, regardless of age: 24.5.1. TRICARE is the secondary payer.  Medicare is the primary payer.  This means that after  Medicare  pays,  TRICARE  could  cover  any  allowable  portion  that  is  not  covered  by Medicare.  It does not mean that both programs may pay the same benefits. 24.5.2. TRICARE for Life (TFL) is TRICARE’S version of a Medicare supplemental plan.  TFL beneficiaries, Medicare becomes the primary  insurance  carrier, and  TFL is secondary.  DoD/uniformed Services and TFL programs do not issue a separate insurance card, with the exception of ID cards authorized within this instruction.  (See Table 1.1 for types of ID cards). Eligibility  for  TFL  is  extended  to  retired  members  (at  or  over  age  65),  their  qualifying dependents and surviving dependents.  Title l0, United States Code, Section l086, provides comparable  civilian  health  care  for  retired  Uniformed  Service  members  and  their  eligible dependents  as  well  as  surviving  dependents  of  deceased  members.    Public  Law  106-398 amended Title 10, United States Code, Section 1086 to authorize TRICARE benefits to those who are Medicare Part A eligible, and enrolled in Medicare Part B, when they turn age 65.  If not eligible at age 65, they may qualify for TFL if they later become eligible for Medicare, Part A and enroll in Medicare, Part B. 24.5.3. Not Eligible for Medicare at Age 65. Individuals who are not eligible for Medicare at age  65  can  be  reinstated  for  continued  TRICARE  coverage  by  presenting  a  Notice  of Disapproved Claim or statement from the SSA indicating they are not eligible for Part A of Medicare under either the sponsor’s, their own, or their spouse’s SSN. 24.5.4. Disabled Retired Members Under Age 65 and Eligible Disabled Dependents.  Title 10, United States Code, Chapter 55 was amended by Public Law 102-190 and Public Law 102-272  to  allow  all  beneficiaries,  under  age  65,  who  would  otherwise  have  lost  eligibility  for TRICARE  due  to  eligibility  for  Medicare  as  a  result  of  disability  to  retain  TRICARE  as  a secondary  payer  if  they  are  enrolled  in  Medicare  Part  A  and  Part  B.    Medicare  Part  B  is required  to  be  purchased  when  they  become  eligible  for  Part  A.    If  not,  TRICARE  can  be restored if Medicare Part B is purchased.  See paragraph 7.1. 24.5.5.

Title 42, U.S.C., Chapter 7, subchapter XVIII, Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, of the Social Security Act, is the basic authority for the Medicare  Program.    Medicare  is  administered  by  the  Centers  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid Services (CMS) of the US Department of Health and Human Services.  There are two parts to Medicare.    They  are  Medicare  Part  A,  Hospital  Insurance  and  Medicare  Part  B,  Medical Insurance.  Table 24.1 addresses Medicare, Part A eligibility:    AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   213  Table 24.1.  Medicare, Part A Eligibility.  ITEM MEDICARE, PART A ELIGIBILITY 2 1  When  TRICARE  eligible  beneficiaries,  including  spouses,  and  children  of  AD members, qualify for Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance Benefits, they must apply for those benefits – they are not automatically provided. (T-2).  It is important for VOs  to  inform  beneficiaries  of  the  need  to  file  for  Medicare  Part  A  Hospital Insurance Benefits because Medicare becomes the primary insurance payer. TRICARE  beneficiaries  should  file  for  a  formal  determination  of  entitlement  for Medicare Part A Hospital Insurance benefits through the SSA when they attain age 65 or they are disabled, regardless of age.  Individuals attain age 65 for Medicare purposes on the first day of the month of their 65th birthday, unless the birthday falls on the first day of the month.  If the birthday falls on the first day of the month, age 65 is attained on the first day of the preceding month.  Ensure  the  sponsor  is  aware  that  TRICARE  is  available  as  the  secondary  payer--only if they are enrolled in Medicare Part B.  Note:  Beneficiaries do not have an option to choose between TRICARE and Medicare. Most Medicare eligible  individuals meet the criteria for “premium-free”  Medicare Part  A  Hospital  Insurance  Benefits.    Individuals  who  do  not  meet  the  criteria  for “premium-free”  benefits  may  purchase  Medicare  Part  A  Hospital  Insurance Benefits. Purchased  Medicare  Part  A  Hospital  Insurance  Benefits  does  not  disqualify  an individual for TRICARE; however, TRICARE becomes the secondary payer. 3 4 ITEM 1    24.6.1. Social Security Disability Insurance.  Table 24.2 provides information for members and eligible dependents receiving Social Security Disability Insurance:  Table 24.2.  Social Security Disability Insurance Information.  SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY INSURANCE Individuals  drawing  Social  Security  Disability  Insurance  benefits  for  24 consecutive  months  automatically  become  eligible  for  Medicare  Part  A  Hospital Insurance benefits in the 25th month: 2  Members  placed  on  the  TDRL,  Medicare  Part  A  and  Part  B  eligibility  impact TRICARE  entitlement.    Refer  to  Beneficiary  Counseling  Assistance  Coordinator (BCAC), MTF for information.  3  Members being placed on the PDRL after having been on TDRL (for at least 24 months),  apply  for  a  formal  determination  of  eligibility  for  Medicare  Part  A Hospital Insurance benefits from the SSA.  Refer to BCAC, MTF for information.   214   AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 24.6.2. Medicare Part A and Part B Insurance Coverage.  The following provides information concerning Medicare, Parts A and B Coverage:  Table 24.3.  Medicare, Parts A and B Coverage.  COVERAGE ITEM 1  Medicare Part A: 2  Medicare, Part B:  Medicare,  Part  A  Hospital  Insurance  helps  pay  for  inpatient  hospital  care, some inpatient care in a skilled nursing facility, home health care, and hospice care.    Having  Medicare  Part  A  Hospital  Insurance,  alone,  does  not  equal coverage under TRICARE.  Medicare,  Part  B  Medical  Insurance  helps  pay  for  medically  necessary doctors’ services and supplies that are not covered by the hospital insurance part of Medicare.  Part B is not premium free. If this portion of Medicare is not elected,  TRICARE  does  not  cover  those  items.    If  Part  A  of  Medicare  is authorized,  Part  B  is  automatic  and  may  not  be  declined  in  order  to  have secondary coverage under TRICARE. Beneficiaries should contact their local Social Security Office for complete information on Medicare Parts A and B.   24.6.3.  An  individual  who  has  not  contributed  toward  Social  Security  may  qualify  for Medicare Part A because a relative (spouse or parent) has made sufficient contributions.  An eligible  TRICARE  beneficiary  qualifying  for  this  reason  would  no  longer  be  eligible  for TRICARE unless they are under age 65 and are receiving benefits under Part A and Part B due to a disability.  In this case, TRICARE would become the secondary payer. 24.6.4. The laws that govern TRICARE and Medicare are very complex.  Whenever there is any question about Medicare entitlement, beneficiaries should be advised to consult their local Social  Security  Office  or  1-800-772-1213  for  enrollment  and  eligibility  questions  (see paragraph 25.5).  24.7.  Medicare Penalties and Equitable Relief.  A beneficiary who does not elect Medicare Part B at the time he or she becomes eligible for Part A will pay a penalty for a late election.  The enrollment period is 1 January through 31 March each year.  Coverage does not begin until         1 July of the year of enrollment.  The monthly premium for Part B is 10 percent higher for each 12-month period the beneficiary could have had medical insurance, but was not enrolled.  24.8.  What is Equitable Relief?  Equitable relief is a process of undoing harm caused to an individual when a beneficiary’s enrollment for Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B, termination, or  coverage  rights  are  prejudiced  because  of  an  error,  misrepresentation,  or  inaction  of  an employee or agent of the government.  Although Equitable Relief is available, it is important to ensure that only correct actions are taken and proper information given to an individual about Medicare.  AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017   215 24.9.    Applying  for  Equitable  Relief.    Refer  the  beneficiary  to  the  DEERS  Support  Office (DSO) when you believe that an agent of DoD has misrepresented a beneficiary’s entitlement to Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B: 24.9.1.  DSO  is  the  authorized  agency  within  the  DoD  to  verify  misrepresentation  by  DoD government agents, which may have prejudiced a beneficiary’s proper election of Medicare Part A and or Medicare Part B. 24.9.2. The DSO does not attempt to assign blame, only to assist the beneficiary in receiving the proper entitlement: 24.9.3. Beneficiaries are asked to write the circumstances regarding their non-election during their original entitlement period to the DSO: 29.9.4. DSO in coordination with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will provide verification to the beneficiary to file with the SSA for Equitable Relief.  Equitable Relief allows the beneficiary to receive Medicare Part A as of their original entitlement date, and to receive Medicare Part B as of either:  24.9.4.1.  Their original entitlement date upon payment of back premiums, or;  24.9.4.2.  The 1st day of the month in which the beneficiary applies for Equitable Relief.  24.9.4.3.    If  beneficiaries  are  interested  in  Equitable  Relief,  they  may  contact  the  DEERS Beneficiary Telephone Center, Monday-Friday, from 0600-1530 (Pacific Time) at 1-800-538-9552.       216    AFI 36-3026_IPV1  4 AUGUST 2017 Chapter 25   UNIFORMED SERVICES DEERS/RAPIDS PROJECT OFFICES, DMDC SUPPORT CENTER, AND FORMS PRESCRIBED 25.1.

The DD Form 1172-2 is used to apply for issuance of a DD Form 2 (Reserve, Retired, and Reserve Retired), a DD Form 1173, a DD Form 1173-1, a DD Form 2764, a DD Form 2765,  and  a  CAC  for  eligible  individuals  who  are  not  enrolled  in  the  Defense  Enrollment Eligibility  Reporting  System  (DEERS)  or  to  update  eligible  individual’s    DEERS  record.  Retention and disposition of the DD Form 1172-2 are in accordance with uniformed services' regulatory instructions.  A3.1.2. DoD sponsors enrolling their dependents in DEERS should complete Sections I, II, and IV. A3.1.3. DoD sponsors updating their own status or adding a personnel condition impacting benefits (e.g., overseas assignment) should complete Sections I and II.  A3.1.4.  Eligible  employees  applying  for  a  CAC  should  complete  Sections  I  and  II  (and Section IV if a Foreign Affiliate on orders to the U.S. with authorized Dependents). The DD Form 1172-2 should then be provided to a DoD Sponsor for authorization and completion of Section III. A3.1.5. DoD sponsors authorizing a CAC for an employee should complete Section III.  A3.1.6.  For  certain  populations  a  paper  form  is  not  required.  (Populations  entered  into RAPIDS via TASS, formerly the Contractor Verification System [CVS]). A3.1.7.

DD Form 1173 and DD Form 2765 Expiration Date: A4.1.1. When the member and his or her spouse are living apart because of a legal separation or interlocutory decree of divorce, set the expiration date at 1 year from the date of issue or the date on which the divorce becomes final.  When a dependent child is going to be residing apart from the sponsor  due to enrollment in a  full-time course of study in an institution of higher learning, the DD Form 1173 may be reissued at any time, regardless of whether or not the current card has expired.  The expiration date of the reissued card is as indicated below (when there appears to be a choice of two or more expiration dates, always choose the earliest date):  A4.2.  MC (TRICARE) Effective Date: A4.2.1.  The  MC  effective  date  is  the  date  that  the  beneficiary  first  becomes  eligible  for TRICARE  coverage.    Once  assigned,  an  MC  effective  date  is  permanent  for  as  long  as TRICARE continually covers the beneficiary. A4.2.2. The MC effective date does not change for dependents on the sponsor's retirement or death unless the retirement or death occurred before 1 January 1967 (the initial date retirees and their dependents became eligible for TRICARE).  In this case and in other instances not covered above, whenever there appears to be a choice of two or more eligibility dates, always choose the latest date. A4.2.3.  If there is a break in eligibility, the date TRICARE eligibility resumes (according to these guidelines) is the MC effective date.   Notes: (To Table A4.1, MC Effective Date)  A.  Date of sponsor's entry on AD or 1 October 1966 (the initial date AD dependents became eligible for TRICARE), if entry was on or before that date.
