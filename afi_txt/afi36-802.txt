DANIEL R SITTERLY Acting Assistant Secretary (Manpower and Reserve Affairs)  Chapter 1 SETTING PAY RATES ATTACHMENT Guidance Changes The below changes to AFI 36-802, dated 1 September 1998, are effective immediately. (Replace) 1.2.4.1. Voluntary Separations. A voluntary separation occurs when an employee chooses to leave federal civilian service on his or her own, and not at the initiation of the agency. Typical voluntary separations include resignation and retirement (includes DoD family members who resign after expiration of leave without pay). Unless applying superior qualification provisions, the following pay setting rules apply to reemployment following voluntary separations: *•Permanent appointments.  Provided employee is eligible under 5 CFR 531.221, set pay using maximum payable rate (MPR) or highest previous rate (HPR), whichever is more beneficial to the employee, when reemploying a former Federal employee following a voluntary separation regardless of the length of the break in service.  Rates of pay for periods of time when the employee’s performance rating was below “Acceptable” (or equivalent) may not be used in determining MPR/HPR. •Term appointments. Pay upon reemployment to a term appointment will be set at step 1 if there was a break in service of more than two years.  If the break is two years or less, GS maximum payable rate or highest previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay, whichever is the most beneficial to the employee, provided that the GS maximum payable rate or HPR was earned in the last two years. •Temporary appointments. Pay upon reemployment to a temporary appointment will be set at step 1 if there was a break in service of more than two years.  If the break is two years or less, GS maximum payable rate or highest previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay, whichever is the most beneficial to the employee, provided that the GS maximum payable rate or HPR was earned in the last two years. (Replace) 1.2.8.1. Voluntary Changes to Lower Grade (CLG). A voluntary CLG is usually requested by the employee for his or her convenience or benefit. Pay will be set in the following ways: •Policy for voluntary CLGs. Unless entitled to grade or pay retention, pay will be set at the step of the lower grade which, upon repromotion, will not place the employee in a rate exceeding that previously held in the higher grade. •Pay retention. In the following situations, pay retention will be granted if the employee’s existing rate of pay cannot be accommodated within the rate range of the lower grade. When the existing rate of pay falls between two steps of the lower grade, the employee is given the higher step. If the selected employee is otherwise eligible and the salary cannot be accommodated within the range, pay retention is authorized. •Formal training program. Employees who accept lower grades to enter a formal training program or Developmental Opportunity Program (DOP). The position must have an approved training plan and must be advertised as a training or DOP position. •Health issues. Employees who accept a lower-grade position for nondisciplinary reasons related to ill health or physical/mental inability to perform the duties of his or her current position (under 1     criteria similar to those used in meeting the responsibilities for selective placement instead of disability retirement). •“Hard-to-fill” positions. Employees who accept lower-grade positions designated as “hard-to- fill” under criteria similar to those used for extending special rates under 5 CFR 530.303(a) & (b). •RIF actions. Employees who voluntarily accept lower-grade positions to lessen the impact of RIF action will be given grade and pay retention (see paragraph 1.3.1.2.). *•After temporary promotion. Provided employee is otherwise eligible under 5 CFR 532.405, pay may be set using MPR or HPR, whichever is more beneficial to the employee, when an employee is returned to his or her permanent grade after a temporary promotion lasting more than 1 year whether the temporary promotion was to a GS or non-GS position even if the terms of the original temporary action specified different pay-setting rules and even if the employee may have signed an agreement/letter that specifies minimum post-temporary assignment pay under 5 CFR 531.215 (c).

Authority and Guidelines for Pay Setting. Authority to set pay rates rests with the appointingauthority.  The Director, Civilian Personnel Operations, Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) or civilianpersonnel officer, acts for the appointing authority.  Pay is set in accordance with the following guide-lines.•Spend employment funds economically.•Don't pay more than needed to attract qualified individuals.•Pay employees fairly and equitably.•Consider:•Local conditions that affect recruiting and retaining qualified employees.•How one employee's pay might affect other employees.•The qualifications, skills, and service history of the employee compared to the requirements of thejob.1.2. Setting Pay Rates. (NOTE:  Use the following policies in conjunction with 5 CFR, Part 531, Sub-part B and 5 CFR, Part 532, Subpart D.)1.2.1. Selecting Rates.   The Director, Civilian Personnel Operations, AFPC, or civilian personnelofficers (until servicing is assumed by the AFPC) or members of their staff are authorized to select theproper rates of pay for employees in accordance with the personnel action taken.  The selecting offi-cial does not have the authority to promise an employee any specific pay rate.  1.2.2. Exceptions. The pay setting policies in 1.2. should be sufficient to cover most situations.Exceptions may be approved by the appointing authority or designee.  Exceptions must be in writingand approved prior to the effective date of the personnel action which establishes the rate of pay.(NOTE:  Exceptions include issues such as the use of highest previous rate (HPR) or GS maximumpayable rate.  MAJCOMs are authorized to approve command-wide exceptions to the pay setting pol-icy for conversion or transfer to lower grade in 1.2.5.3. and voluntary changes to lower grade in1.2.8.1.)1.2.3. New Appointments. Pay for a new appointment may be set in one of the following ways:1.2.3.1. Minimum Step (Step 1). Pay is usually set at step 1 for a new appointment.  Step 1 is theminimum rate for General Schedule (GS), Federal Wage System (FWS), special rate, or othertypes of pay systems (e.g., AFI 36-1101).1.2.3.2. Higher than Step 1. In rare cases, an employee’s pay may be set beyond step 1 for a newappointment.  The approval must be documented on the SF-50, Notification of Personnel Action.•Chapter 5 authorizes the setting of pay beyond step 1 for a GS position based on superior qualifica-tions.•Pay may be set beyond step 1 for FWS positions based on special qualifications (5 CFR 532.403(b)).•Pay is set beyond step 1 for FWS positions when the lead agency for a wage area has designated astep above step 1 as the minimum step-rate for hard-to-fill positions.4AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19981.2.3.3. Other Options. Chapter 4 provides information on recruitment bonuses which must beconsidered before setting pay beyond step 1 for non-FWS candidates (5 CFR 531.203(b)(3)).1.2.4. Reemployment. Employees are reemployed after one of two types of separation, voluntary orinvoluntary.  The type of separation impacts pay setting.  The following pay setting provisions applyto reemployment following a break in service.1.2.4.1. Voluntary Separations. A voluntary separation occurs when an employee chooses toleave federal civilian service on his or her own, and not at the initiation of the agency.  Typicalvoluntary separations include resignation and retirement (includes DoD family members whoresign after expiration of leave without pay).  Unless applying superior qualification provisions,the following pay setting rules apply to reemployment following voluntary separations:•Permanent appointments.  Pay  for former federal civilian employees reemployed on  a continuingappointment after a voluntary separation will be set at step 1 when the break in service is more thantwo years.  If two years or less, GS maximum payable rate or highest previous rate (HPR) will beused to set pay, whichever is the most beneficial to the employee, provided that the GS maximumpayable rate or HPR was earned in the last two years.  •Term appointments.  Pay upon reemployment to a term appointment will be set at step 1 if there wasa break in service of more than two years.  If the break is two years or less, GS maximum payablerate or highest previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay, whichever is the most beneficial to theemployee, provided that the GS maximum payable rate or HPR was earned in the last two years.•Temporary appointments.  Pay upon reemployment to a temporary appointment will be set at step 1if there was a break in service of more than two years.  If the break is two years or less, GS maxi-mum payable rate or highest previous rate (HPR) will be used to set pay, whichever is the mostbeneficial to the employee, provided that the GS maximum payable rate or HPR was earned in thelast two years.1.2.4.2. Involuntary Separations. An involuntary separation is one that occurred through nofault of the employee and not at the employee’s request.•Priority Placement Program (PPP), except for Program S (military spouse), and Interagency CareerTransition Program (ICTAP):  •Air Force minimum requirement for placement through the PPP and ICTAP.  Pay for an employeewho, after a break in service of more than three calendar days, is reemployed through the PPP is setat a step rate at least equal to the current rate for the grade and step the employee held at the time ofseparation, unless the rate is greater than the maximum rate of the grade.  If the pay is greater thanthe top step, pay is set at the top step of the grade.  Compare this rate to that earned by applying theGS maximum payable rate or HPR rules, setting the employee’s pay at the rate providing the great-est  benefit.    (NOTE:    In  the  same  manner,  the  current  rate  is  preserved  for  FWS  employeesappointed to lower or higher paying wage areas under the PPP.)•Reemployment Priority List (RPL):•Air Force minimum requirement for placement from the RPL.  Pay for an employee who, after abreak in service of more than three calendar days, is reemployed from the RPL is set at a step rateat least equal to the current rate for the grade and step the employee held at the time of separation,unless the rate is greater than the maximum rate of the grade.  If the pay is greater than the top step,pay is set at the top step of the grade.  Compare this rate to that earned by applying the GS maxi-AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19985mum payable rate or HPR rules, setting the employee’s pay at the rate providing the greatest bene-fit.  Grade and pay retention are not authorized upon reemployment from the RPL.•Mandatory Restoration.  The pay of an employee who is reemployed as a result of mandatory resto-ration rights is set at a rate at least equal to the rate the employee would be receiving if he or shenever left federal civil service.•Workers Compensation.  Every effort should be made to restore an employee, or former employee,who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and can return to limited duty.  When pos-sible, the employee should be offered a position at the current or last grade held before separatedfrom the agency rolls.  If this is not possible, following Office of Workers Compensation Program(OWCP) procedures, the employee is reemployed at the last grade held and immediately changedto lower grade for the position identified to return him or her to the workforce.  On the lower gradeoffer,  the  employee  is  given  pay  retention.    Set  the  pay  at  the  rate  the  employee  would  havereceived had they been continuously employed, including any within-grade increases (WGIs).•Upon reemployment of a prior Schedule C employee whose appointment was terminated or who vol-untarily resigned in anticipation of termination because of a change in agency leadership, pay is setso it does not exceed the employee's highest previous rate or the top step of the grade, whichever islower.1.2.5. Conversions or Transfers:1.2.5.1. Conversion or Transfer at the Same Grade .•Air Force minimum requirement for continuous service.•The  pay  of  an  employee  who  is  converted  or  transferred  at  the  same  grade  during  continuousemployment is set at the step which is at least equal to the current step.  This applies to conversionsto both permanent and temporary appointments and transfers.•In a conversion or transfer action of a FWS employee, pay will be set based on the wage rate of thegaining installation.•In a conversion or transfer of a GS employee, unless entitled to a special salary rate, total compensa-tion includes base pay plus applicable locality pay of the gaining installation.•The pay of a GM employee moved to a GS position will be set on the pay scale at a rate at least equalto the existing rate of pay.  If the existing rate of pay falls between two steps, pay is set at the higherstep.•In conversion or transfer of a GS or FWS employee, if the employee meets the eligibility require-ments for a WGI, set pay to include a WGI if the waiting period was met.1.2.5.2. Conversion or Transfer to a Higher Grade. Pay for conversions or transfers to posi-tions at a higher grade is set by one of the following, whichever is the most beneficial to theemployee:  Governmentwide GS mandatory promotion rule, FWS promotion rule, Air Forcerepromotion requirement, HPR rule, or GS maximum payable rate rule.  Pay is set at the step atleast equal to the current grade and step.  1.2.5.3. Conversion or Transfer to a Lower Grade. Unless entitled to grade or pay retention,pay for conversions or transfers to positions at a lower grade will be set at a step of the lower gradewhich upon repromotion will not place the employee in a rate exceeding that previously held inthe higher grade.61.2.6. Reassignments:AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19981.2.6.1. No Change in Pay. Under normal circumstances, pay setting for a reassignment actionresults in no change in pay.  Exceptions to the normal circumstance follow.•Changes between regular and special pay schedules.•Pay  will increase when an  employee  is  reassigned from  a  regular  to a special pay schedule.   Anemployee’s pay is set at the same step in the special pay schedule as received in the regular payschedule.•Pay is usually decreased when an employee is reassigned from a special to a regular pay schedule.This occurs because the employee’s pay is normally set at the same step in the regular pay scheduleas received in the special pay schedule.  There are some rare cases of exception.  The most com-mon  is  the  case  of  an  employee  who  is  involuntarily  reassigned  (i.e.,  reduction-in-force  (RIF),transfer of function, etc.) from a special pay schedule to a regular pay schedule and is thereforeentitled to pay retention providing the employee’s existing rate of pay cannot be accommodatedwithin the rate range.  When the existing rate of pay falls between two steps, the employee is giventhe higher step.•Changes between wage areas.  When a FWS employee is voluntarily reassigned between wage areas,pay is set using the wage schedule for the area where the employee is moving.  When the reassign-ment is to a position in a lower wage area, the employee is entitled to a rate at least equal to his orher existing rate wherever possible.  If that rate falls in between two steps in the new wage sched-ule,  the employee is given  the higher  step.   If  his  or  her existing  rate exceeds the  top step,  theemployee is given the top step of the grade to which assigned.  Pay retention will not be given to aFWS employee who voluntarily requests and accepts a position in a lower wage schedule area.•Changes between locality areas.  When a GS employee is reassigned (voluntarily or involuntarily)between locality areas, pay is set on the appropriate rate from the basic GS pay schedule.  Totalcompensation includes base pay plus the locality pay for the new duty location, unless the individ-ual is entitled to a special salary rate that is more beneficial.1.2.6.2. Change in Pay. When an employee moves from GM to GS, pay is set at the rate for thesame grade on the GS pay schedule that is equal to or exceeds the employee’s current rate of pay;i.e., if the rate falls between two steps, pay is set at the higher step.1.2.7. Promotions.   Pay for promotions is set by one of the following, whichever is the most benefi-cial to the employee:  Governmentwide GS mandatory promotion rule, FWS promotion rule, AirForce repromotion requirement, HPR rule, or GS maximum payable rate rule.  If pay falls betweentwo steps, the higher step will be used.1.2.7.1. Governmentwide Mandatory Promotion Rule.  •GS.  Generally, the pay of a GS employee promoted to a GS position is set in the step that exceedsthe existing rate of pay by at least two step increases unless that rate exceeds the top step of thegrade.  If the rate exceeds the top step of the new grade, pay is set at the top step.•FWS.  The pay of a FWS employee promoted to a FWS position is set in the step that exceeds theexisting pay by four percent of the representative rate of the grade from which the employee is pro-moted.  If the rate exceeds the top step, pay is set at the top step.1.2.7.2. FWS Promotions.   For FWS employees who receive a promotion and move to a differ-ent wage area, compute the employee’s pay as if there were two pay actions, a promotion and aAFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19987reassignment, processing them in the order which gives the employee the maximum benefit (5CFR 532.407(c)).1.2.7.3. Promotions Between Pay Systems: When an employee moves from the FWS pay sys-tem to the GS pay system or vice versa, pay is set using the appropriate pay setting directives forthe pay system the employee is moving to.  Determine current annual salary of a FWS employeeby multiplying the hourly rate by 2087 (work hours in a year).•FWS to GS:  “One Cent Rule”.  The GS mandatory promotion rule (“two steps”) does not apply toFWS employees promoted to GS positions.  To constitute a promotion, the FWS employee’s exist-ing rate of pay must have increased by at least one cent upon being placed in a GS position.  To setpay, accomplish the following:  Compare the FWS annual rate of pay with the rate range for the GSposition the employee is being placed in; the GS step that exceeds the FWS rate by at least one centis the rate at which pay is set.  •GS/GM to FWS.  Identify the action by using representative rates.  Pay is set in the lowest FWS stepthat exceeds the employee’s existing rate of pay by four percent of the GS representative rate of thegrade from which promoted.•GM to GS.  Pay is set using the GS mandatory promotion rule IAW 5 U.S.C. 5334(b).1.2.7.4. Regular and Special Pay Schedules:•From regular to special pay schedule.  On the regular pay schedule, determine the step of the newgrade using the GS two-step rule.  The employee’s pay is set at that step on the special pay sched-ule.•From special to regular pay schedule.  On the special pay schedule, determine the step of the newgrade using the  GS  two-step rule.   On  the regular  pay schedule  find  that  rate for the  grade  theemployee is being promoted to.  If the rate falls between two steps, pay is set at the higher step.This rate on the regular pay schedule becomes the employee’s pay.  If the rate is less than step 1 ofthe new grade, pay is set at step 1.  If the top step of the grade is exceeded, pay is then set at the topstep.1.2.7.5. Air Force Repromotion Requirement:•Following  involuntary  change  to  lower  grade  (CLG)  (employee  not  at  fault).    The  pay  of  anemployee promoted from a grade to which they were changed involuntarily through no fault oftheir own must be set at a rate at least equal to the current rate of the grade and step from whichdemoted.  If the employee is on retained pay and that rate is higher than the maximum step of thenew grade, the employee is kept on pay retention.•Following voluntary CLG and involuntary CLG (employee at fault).  The GS two-step rule, or FWSfour percent rule, will be used to set the pay of employees who were voluntarily changed to lowergrade or involuntarily changed to lower grade when the employee was at fault.1.2.8. Change to Lower Grade:1.2.8.1. Voluntary Changes to Lower Grade (CLG). A voluntary CLG is usually requested bythe employee for his or her convenience or benefit.  Pay will be set in the following ways:•Policy for voluntary CLGs.  Unless entitled to grade or pay retention, pay will be set at the step of thelower grade which, upon repromotion, will not place the employee in a rate exceeding that previ-ously held in the higher grade.8AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 1998•Pay retention.  In the following situations, pay retention will be granted if the employee’s existingrate of pay cannot be accommodated within the rate range of the lower grade.  When the existingrate of pay falls between two steps of the lower grade, the employee is given the higher step.  If theselected employee is otherwise eligible and the salary cannot be accommodated within the range,pay retention is authorized.•Formal training program.  Employees who accept lower grades to enter a formal training program orDevelopmental Opportunity Program (DOP).  The position must have an approved training planand must be advertised as a training or DOP position.•Health issues.  Employees who accept a lower-grade position for nondisciplinary reasons related toill health or physical/mental inability to perform the duties of his or her current position (under cri-teria similar to those used in meeting the responsibilities for selective placement instead of disabil-ity retirement).  •“Hard-to-fill” positions.  Employees who accept lower-grade positions designated as “hard-to-fill”under criteria similar to those used for extending special rates under 5 CFR 530.303(a) and (b).•RIF actions.  Employees who voluntarily accept lower-grade positions to lessen the impact of RIFaction will be given grade and pay retention (see paragraph 1.3.1.2.).•After temporary promotion.  When an employee is returned to his or her permanent grade after atemporary promotion, pay is set as if the temporary promotion had not occurred.  If the employeebecame eligible for a WGI or comparability increase during the temporary promotion, pay is set toinclude that increase.1.2.8.2. Involuntary CLGs:•Employee at fault.  If the CLG is caused by the employee’s failure to perform acceptably or for dis-ciplinary reasons, pay is set at a rate from step 1 up to the step of the lower grade which, if repro-moted, will not place the employee in a rate exceeding that previously held in the higher grade.•Employee not at fault:•Employees are usually not at fault in most involuntary CLGs.  They are typically caused by RIF andreclassification.  Pay for these employees is set using grade and pay retention regulations.•Pay for employees who are changed to lower grade because of failure to successfully complete asupervisory or managerial probationary period is set under the governmentwide minimum require-ment.  Under this requirement, the employee is entitled to be placed in a job with no lower gradeand pay than the job left to accept the supervisory or managerial position.  The employee is alsoentitled to any WGIs he or she would have received at that grade if the assignment to the supervi-sory or managerial job never occurred.•Acceptance of a lower grade by a federal employee in order to accompany a military member orDoD federal civilian employee sponsor on a permanent change of station (PCS) is not consideredto be a change to lower grade at the employee’s request.  If the existing rate of pay for such federalemployee falls between two steps of the lower grade, pay will be set at the higher step.  Pay will beset at an even higher step in the lower grade, in accordance with the highest previous rate rule, ifthe employee has earned entitlement to a higher rate by service in another position.1.2.9. Dual Appointments for FWS Employees.   When an FWS employee serves under a dualappointment (which includes either a temporary and a permanent appointment or two permanent sea-sonal appointments), set pay as follows.AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19989•When the temporary appointment is at a lower grade, set the waiting period for a WGI from the dateof the last equivalent increase in the regular permanent position.  Set the waiting period for the tem-porary position from the date of the temporary CLG.•When the temporary appointment is at a higher grade, credit the time the employee spends in thetemporary appointment toward the waiting period for a WGI in the permanent position.•When an employee serves under two permanent appointments, credit the time the employee spendsin the lower graded position toward the waiting period for a WGI in the higher graded position.1.2.10. Career Program Positions. Personnel actions taken within the career programs are consid-ered "management initiated" rather than "at the employee's request."  Employees selected from careerprogram certificates or assigned as a result of a policy council chair approval of a noncompetitiveplacement at a lower grade will continue to be paid at their existing rate of pay, if it can be accommo-dated within the rate range of the lower grade.  When the existing rate of pay falls between two stepsof the lower grade, the employee is given the higher step.  If the selected employee is otherwise eligi-ble and the salary cannot be accommodated within the range, then he or she is entitled to pay reten-tion.1.2.10.1. Career Program External Applicant System (CPEAS).   Employees selected from aCPEAS certificate will be granted pay retention if the position meets the hard-to-fill criteria.Hard-to-fill positions are experienced when application of a career program promotion evaluationpattern (PEP) generates five or fewer highly qualified candidates for promotion. 1.2.11. Overseas Return Rights.   When an employee exercises overseas return rights, pay is setupon return to the former grade in the United States at a rate at least equal to the step rate to which theemployee would have progressed had the employee not gone overseas.  Employees who exercisereturn rights to a lower grade are authorized pay retention.  However, if the salary may be set at thelower grade without the need for pay retention, the higher step rate will be used when the salary fallsbetween two steps.1.2.12. Nonforeign Cost-of-Living Allowance (COLA). When nonforeign COLA is involved,determine the nature of action (NOA) and set pay as follows.1.2.12.1. NOA Determination:•GS to FWS.  Do not add nonforeign COLA to GS pay for determination of the representative rate.Identify the action by using representative rates.•FWS to GS.  Do not add nonforeign COLA to GS pay.  Identify the type of action after pay is setusing GS pay rules.1.2.12.2. Set pay:•GS to FWS.  Add nonforeign COLA to GS pay to establish rate of basic pay in FWS position.•FWS to GS.  Do not add nonforeign COLA to establish rate of basic pay in GS position.1.2.13. Appointments Between Nonappropriated Fund (NAF) and Appropriated  Fund (APF)Employment Systems.  The DoD Employee Benefit Portability Program applies to DoD permanentcivilian employees who move between Air Force and civil service employment systems within DoDwithout a break in service of more than three calendar days.  This program applies regardless ofwhether the move is involuntary or voluntary.  However, many provisions are applied differentlydepending on whether the move is involuntary or voluntary.10AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19981.2.13.1. Movement From a NAF Position to a GS Position:  1.2.13.1.1. Involuntary Movement. Pay will be set at a rate within the grade to which movedthat is not less than the employee’s rate of basic pay under the NAF system immediately priorto the move.  In determining the last rate of basic pay, a saved pay rate to which the employeewas entitled under the NAF system will apply, as well as pay received in a NAF special rateposition.  Additions to pay such as night shift, environmental differential, and other premiumpayments are excluded from consideration as basic pay.  Basic pay may not be set above themaximum of the grade to which moved, except as provided by grade and pay retention provi-sions.•Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move results in a reduction in grade orpay.•A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to which the employee isconverted is lower than the representative rate of the position from which the employee moved.For pay banded employees, the employee’s current existing rate of basic pay is the representativerate.•Prior to moving an employee from NAF Pay Band V to a GS position, the NAF activity determinesif an adjustment in NAF pay is necessary.  Adjustments in NAF pay are effected, where necessary,to ensure that the maximum rate of pay retained in the move will not exceed the rate of pay for aGS-15, Step 10 for the position and geographical area to which moved.1.2.13.1.2. Voluntary Movement. Pay will be set at the rate of the new grade which does notexceed the employee’s highest previous rate of NAF basic pay.  The highest previous rate ofpay is computed according to 5 CFR 531.206.  The employee’s pay cannot be less than theminimum rate of the grade of the position.1.2.13.2. Movement From NAF Crafts and Trades Position to an APF Wage Sched u l ePosition.1.2.13.2.1. Involuntary Movement. Pay will be set at the employee’s existing scheduled rateof pay; or, a rate which does not exceed his or her highest previous rate of NAF basic pay,whichever is the most beneficial to the employee.  However, if the highest previous rate fallsbetween two rates of the new grade, the higher rate will be paid.  The highest previous rate iscomputed according to OPM Operating Manual - Federal Wage System NAF, S8-3e.  Theemployee’s pay cannot be less than the minimum rate of the grade of the position.  •Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move resulted in a reduction in gradeor pay.  Grade and pay retention benefits will be administered according to OPM Operating Man-ual - Federal Wage System NAF, Subchapter S9.•A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to which the employee isconverted is lower than the representative rate of the position from which the employee moved.  1.2.13.2.2. Voluntary Movement. Pay will be set at the rate of the new grade which does notexceed the employee’s highest previous rate of NAF basic pay.  The highest previous rate ofpay is computed according to OPM Operating Manual - Federal Wage System NAF, S8-3e.The employee’s pay cannot be less than the minimum rate of the grade of the position.1.2.13.3. Movement From a UA, AS, PS, or Pay Band NAF Position to an APF WageSchedule Position.  AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 1998111.2.13.3.1. Involuntary Movement. Pay is set according to paragraph 1.2.3.•Grade and pay retention benefits apply where the involuntary move resulted in a reduction in gradeor pay.  Grade and pay retention benefits are administered according to OPM Operating Manual -Federal Wage System NAF, Subchapter S9.•A reduction in grade occurs when the representative rate of the position to which the employee isconverted is lower than the representative rate of the position from which the employee moved.For pay banded employees, the employee’s current existing rate of basic pay is the representativerate.  1.2.13.3.2. Voluntary Movement. Pay is set according to paragraph 1.2.3.1.3. Grade and Pay Retention:1.3.1. Grade Retention.   Grade retention applies when:•An eligible employee moves to a lower-grade position through RIF or a situation that the DeputyAssistant Secretary of Defense (Civilian Personnel Policy) (DASD(CPP)) decides is comparable toa RIF.  Grade retention is applicable if the employee has served for 52 consecutive weeks or morein a position or positions under a covered pay schedule at a grade or grades higher than the positionin which the employee is being placed (see 5 CFR 536.103(c)(1) and (3) for additional guidance).•An employee's position has been reduced in grade as a result of reclassification.  Grade retention isapplicable if the employee's current position has been classified for a continuous period of at leastone year immediately before the position is classified at a lower grade.•An eligible employee is placed through the Priority Placement Program, without a break in serviceof three days or less, including those resulting from early registration, even though the employeedoes not have a specific RIF notice.•DoD authorizes grade retention for other reasons, for example, drawdown of an installation.  1.3.1.1. Title 5 CFR 536.103(b) allows the head of an agency to offer grade retention under cer-tain circumstances to employees who meet general eligibility requirements but do not have a spe-cific entitlement by law or regulation.1.3.1.2. Within DoD, grade retention applies when:•An employee receives a RIF notice proposing a change to lower grade or separation and accepts alower-grade position at the same or another DoD activity.  If the position accepted is not a gradelower than one which has been offered by his or her activity, grade retention will be granted.  If theposition  accepted is  at  a  grade  lower than one  which  has  been offered,  grade  retention  may  begranted,  provided  the  employee  meets  all  other  eligibility  requirements  and  management  deter-mines that placement in the position is in the government's interest.  (NOTE:  In the Air Force, ifthey do  not  meet the  other eligibility requirements  for  grade retention  under this  provision,  butwould  otherwise  be  granted  grade  retention,  pay  retention  will  be  authorized  providing  theemployee’s existing rate of pay cannot be accommodated within the rate range of the lower grade.When the existing rate of pay falls between two steps of the lower grade, the employee is given thehigher rate.)•An  employee  in  an  organization  undergoing  realignment  or  reduction,  who  is  not  personallyimpacted by those actions, requests a CLG.  He or she may be granted grade retention only if man-12AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 1998agement determines that the employee’s CLG will result in placement of the employee in a moresuitable position and will lessen or avoid the impact of the RIF on other employees.•Under other circumstances, for example, restructuring when RIF is not involved, when approved byDoD on an individual case basis.  Requests must be fully documented and forwarded through therespective MAJCOM to HQ USAF/DPCE, 1040 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040for processing to DoD. 1.3.1.3. Eligible employees are entitled to a 2-year grade retention period unless terminated inaccordance with the provisions of 5 CFR 536.208; for example, declining a reasonable offer.1.3.1.4. In other circumstances not covered by this chapter, as determined by HQ USAF/DPC,resulting from personnel actions initiated by management to further the agency’s mission, to theextent that the intent of applicable law and regulation is met.  Requests for grade retention must befully documented and forwarded through the respective MAJCOM to HQ USAF/DPCE, 1040 AirForce Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1040.1.3.2. Grade Retention for FWS Employees Who Move From a High to a Low  Wage Area.  Inmost cases, FWS employees under grade retention will continue to receive the same rate of basic pay.Under some circumstances, for example, movement from one wage area to another wage area, theemployee' s rate of pay is determined by the schedule in the new wage area.  In determining theemployee's pay, the employee is entitled to the greater of:•The basic pay held before moving;•Rate from new schedule for same step held before moving; or•Lowest rate from the new wage schedule which equals or exceeds pay before moving.1.3.2.1. Frequently the movement of a FWS employee from a high wage area to an area with alower wage schedule will result in the employee's existing rate of pay exceeding step 5 of his orher retained grade on the new geographic (lower) wage schedule.  In such cases, the employeecontinues to retain his or her basic pay before the movement.1.3.2.2. FWS Within-Grade Increases Under Grade Retention.  During the 2-year grade retentionperiod, a FWS employee is entitled to WGIs in the retained grade unless the rate of basic pay, asdetermined under grade retention provisions, is above step 5 on the pay schedule in the new wagearea.  The WGI is based on the pay schedule in the new wage area.  For example, if an employee’sretained grade and rate of basic pay equals WG-5, step 2, and the employee becomes eligible forstep 3, and step 3 is 30 cents more than step 2 on the "new schedule," then this amount would beadded to the employee's retained rate of pay.  1.3.2.3. FWS Annual Adjustments Under Grade Retention.  Annual adjustments are based on the"new" schedule, that is, the schedule in the different geographic area.  If the employee is in anystep but step 0, he or she will be paid the rate for his or her step on the new schedule.  Employeesreceive 100 percent of the annual adjustment during the 2-year grade retention period.  Employeesin step 0 receive the difference between step 5 on the previous schedule and step 5 on the newadjusted schedule.  These "adjustments" are added to the employee's existing retained rate of pay.1.3.2.4. Decrease in Wage Schedule Under Grade Retention.  When pay is adjusted up, theemployee is entitled to the new rate of pay for the retained grade and step.  While 5 CFR does notdirectly address pay schedule decreases, it does state that the retained grade is to be treated as thegrade of the employee's position for most purposes; therefore, the employee should be paid at theAFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 199813new rate, whether it results from an increase or decrease in the pay schedule.  Employees on graderetention can waive their grade retention entitlement (5 U.S.C. 5362(d) (4)), however, such waiverdoes not result in eligibility for pay retention.  An employee entitled to grade retention will receivepay retention only as a result of the expiration of the 2-year period of grade retention.1.3.3. Pay Retention.   Pay retention is provided when:•The grade retention period ends.•Under other circumstances when an employee's pay would otherwise be reduced.1.3.3.1. Within DoD, pay retention will be granted when:•An employee accepts a lower-grade position designated in advance as hard-to-fill under criteria sim-ilar to those used for extending special rates under 5 CFR 530.303(a) and (b).•An employee is reduced in grade upon return from an overseas assignment according to the terms ofa preestablished agreement.  This includes employees who are released from the period of servicespecified  in  their  current  transportation  agreement  due  to  a  management  initiated  action,  andemployees who have completed more than one year under their current agreement and who arereleased from the specified period of service because of compelling personal reasons of a humani-tarian or compassionate nature, such as may involve physical or mental health or circumstancesover which the employee has no control.  Also included are nondisplaced overseas employees withno obligation to return who are covered by DoD 1400.20-1-M, DoD Program for Stability of Civil-ian Employment, Policies, Procedures, and Programs Manual, September 1990, with Changes 1through 3 (chapter 6, paragraph C).•An Army or Air Force reserve technician has or is scheduled to lose eligibility through no fault of hisor her own (that is, "status quo" employees), and he or she accepts placement in a lower grade non-reserve position.  (NOTE:  In the Air Force, pay retention is not authorized when an air reservetechnician  (ART)  accepts  a  voluntary  CLG  in  lieu  of  separation  under  the  high  year  of  tenure(HYT) program.)•Former employees, who have been receiving injury compensation, accept a job offer to a positionwith a lower grade than the last position held in order to return to active employment.•An employee accepts a lower-grade position for nondisciplinary reasons of ill health under criteriasimilar to those used in meeting the responsibilities for selective placement instead of disabilityretirement.1.3.3.2. Pay retention may be extended to employees when:•Authorized by HQ USAF/DPC, as a result of personnel actions initiated by management to furtherthe Air Force's mission, to the extent that the general intent of grade and pay retention are met. 1.3.3.3. Pay retention will not be extended when an employee is returning from an overseasassignment because of unacceptable performance (as defined in 5 CFR, Part 432) or personalcause (as defined in 5 CFR, Part 752).  1.3.3.4. Unless otherwise entitled to pay retention, employees selected for overseas positions arenot authorized pay retention, except as provided in paragraphs 1.2.10. and 1.3.3.2.1.3.4. Pay Retention for FWS Employees.   Pay retention will not be given to a FWS employeewho voluntarily requests and accepts a position in a lower wage schedule area.  14AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 19981.3.4.1. When there is entitlement to pay retention, that is, at the end of the 2-year grade retentionperiod, a FWS employee is entitled to:•Lowest scheduled rate of basic pay in the employee's grade after the action is taken which equals orexceeds his or her current rate of basic pay (NOTE:  When the rate of pay falls between two sched-uled rates, the employee will be placed in the higher of the two rates).•When there is no rate that equals or exceeds the employee's current rate of pay, the employee willretain either his or her current rate of basic pay or 150 percent of the maximum rate of basic pay forthe employee's grade after the action is taken, whichever is less.1.3.4.2. FWS Annual Adjustments Under Pay Retention. A FWS employee is entitled to 50percent of the amount of each annual adjustment in the maximum rate of basic pay payable to hisor her grade.  Adjustment will be made prior to a comparison with the maximum step of the gradeto decide whether the employee stops receiving a retained rate.1.3.4.3. Decrease in Wage Schedule. When there is a decrease in the wage schedule, anemployee entitled to retained pay will continue to receive the rate that was in effect prior to thedecrease.  There is no legal authority for a reduction in pay under these circumstances.1.4. Apprentice and Shop Trainee. When employees are receiving training and instruction designed toqualify them to perform all required duties in trade and craft occupations specified in Air Force approvedtraining programs, they are paid under a special pay plan for such programs.  The special pay plan can beused only for apprentices or shop trainees.  To establish a special pay plan for apprentice and shop traineesand to set pay rates see OPM Operating Manual - Federal Wage System, Subchapter 11.1.5. Changing Pay Rates. Change pay rates only when you take a personnel action which changes anemployee's:•Position.•Grade.•Type of appointment.AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 199815Chapter 2 DUAL PAY AND DUAL EMPLOYMENT2.1.

Format for Service Agreement for Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses.SERVICE AGREEMENT FOR RECRUITMENT AND RELOCATION BONUSESA.  INTRODUCTION.  The Air Force has delegated authority to approve a recruitment or relocation bonus to officials with appointing authority or their designee.  The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5753, subparts A and B, part 575 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, and Department of Defense (DoD) policies require, as a condition for receiving the bonus, that the employee sign a written service agreement to com-plete a minimum of 12 months with the DoD.B.  CONDITIONS OF SERVICE:1.  Employees who accept a recruitment or relocation bonus are required to serve a minimum of 12 months in the DoD.  Failure to meet this requirement will place the employee in debt to the DoD and he or she will be required to repay the bonus on a pro rata basis.  The amount to be repaid will be determined by providing credit for each full month of employment completed under the service agreement.  Failure to complete the period of employment established under this service agreement will occur if the employee's service with the DoD is terminated before completion of the specified period of employment.  2.  The bonus shall be calculated as a percentage of the employee's rate of basic pay and will be paid as a lump sum.  Actual payment of the bonus will not occur until the employee has entered on duty or reported to the new duty location.3.  The bonus is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay prescribed in subpart B, part 530 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations.  It is also considered to be income for federal income tax purposes.C.  AGREEMENT.  I, (name of employee), have read the preceding paragraphs and understand that I must complete at least 12 months of service in the Department of Defense as a condition of my receipt of a (type of bonus) bonus.  I further understand failure to complete this period of service will result in my 22AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 1998indebtedness to the federal government and I will be required to repay the bonus on a pro rata basis.  I agree to these terms and accept a (type of bonus) bonus in the amount of ____ percent of my basic pay.Employee (Name)Approval Authority (Installation Commander ordesignee)DateDate4.5.2. Retention Allowance. Do not consider retention allowances to be part of basic pay.  Pay them:•In the same manner and at the same time as basic pay.  •For as long as the conditions require continuing the allowance.  •After an annual review and recertification, if the allowance continues beyond 12 months.  4.5.2.1. Reduce or discontinue the allowance at any time when:•A lesser amount or no allowance at all would retain the employee.•Labor market conditions have changed and you can recruit employees without paying a recruitmentbonus.•The need for the services of the employee have lessened.•Budgetary concerns prevent payment.4.5.2.2. The service agreement for relocation bonuses runs concurrently with the service agree-ment for a permanent change of station.  Failure to complete the service agreement will obligatethe employee to a pro rata repayment of the bonus.4.6. Recording Recruitment and Relocation Bonuses and Retention Allowances.   Approving offi-cials are responsible for ensuring the basis for payment of the bonus or allowance is fully documented.This documentation will be retained in the servicing personnel office.  4.7. Supervisory Differentials. An official's decision to grant a supervisory differential, including theamount of the differential, must be reviewed and approved by an official at a higher organizational level.See table A3.1 for a quick reference on granting supervisory differentials.  4.7.1. Officials with delegated review and approval authority may designate subordinates to makeinitial differential decisions, subject to the official's final review and approval.  Designations must bein writing and be included in local operating instructions.4.7.2. Only the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of Defense may approve supervisory differentials forindividuals appointed to Schedule C positions.  Requests for approval of supervisory differentials forSchedule C positions will be coordinated through 11 MSS/DPC and HQ USAF/DPC prior to submis-sion to DoD.4.7.3. Supervisory differentials:•May not be paid if the subordinate upon which the differential is based is a foreign national (direct orindirect hire) or nonappropriated fund employee.•Will be calculated and paid in accordance with 5 CFR 575.405.AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 199823•Will be adjusted and terminated in accordance with 5 CFR 575.406.  •Will be terminated within 30 calendar days after the subordinate position or positions used as thebasis for a supervisory differential becomes vacant. 4.8. Documenting and Recording Supervisory Differentials. Approving officials document the grant-ing of a supervisory differential.  Documentation includes:•Sufficient information for reconstructing the action.•Basis for determining the amount of the differential.•The comparison of continuing pay required by 5 CFR 575.405. 4.8.1.

Note also that, although a relocation bonus and a recruitment bonus cannot be paid to the same employee concurrently, approval could be granted to pay a relocation bonus to an employee who had previously received a recruitment bonus.  This would be appropriate only in rare situations where the need for relocation could not have been foreseen when the recruitment bonus was offered.AFI36-802   1 SEPTEMBER 199837Attachment 4 CHAIN OF AIR FORCE APPROVAL AUTHORITIESTable A4.1.
