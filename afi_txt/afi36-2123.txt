Enlisted Aide Duties. Enlisted aides are authorized for the purpose of relieving general officers ofthose minor tasks and details which, if performed by the officers, would be at the expense of the officers’primary military and official duties.  The duties of these enlisted personnel shall be concerned with tasksrelating to the military and official responsibilities of the officers, to include assisting general officers indischarging their official DoD social responsibilities of their assigned positions.  The propriety of suchduties is governed by the official purpose which they serve rather than the nature of the duties.  No officermay use an enlisted member for duties that contribute only to the officer’s personal benefit and that haveno reasonable connection with the officer’s official responsibilities. 2.1.  Examples of Enlisted Aide duties and responsibilities.  In accordance with DoD Instruction1315.09 and in connection with military and official functions and duties, enlisted aides are utilized toundertake duties similar to the following: 2.1.1.

In the course of preparing and serving a meal for the general officer, theenlisted aide may prepare the same meal for the general officer’s dependents and others associatedwith the general officer’s military and official duties (including duties associated with socialresponsibilities) who are dining with the general officer.   2.1.5.1.  For example, social events may be used to develop professional relationships withcivilian, military and foreign counterparts.  While the specific event may appear informal, thegeneral officer may use these informal events to serve a more direct purpose of building orenhancing a relationship that ultimately results in the general officer being more effective inthe execution of his/her military duties and responsibilities.  The general officer will use goodjudgment to ensure there is a nexus between these types of events and the desired enhancementof professional relationships and execution of military responsibilities. 2.1.6.  Performing tasks that aid the general officer in the performance of military and officialresponsibilities, including performing errands for the general, providing security for the quarters,and providing administrative assistance. 2.1.7.  Duty hours will be set by the general officer to those hours that maximize the benefit to thegeneral officer by affording the aide the best opportunity to perform enlisted aide duties IAW para-graph 2.  These hours will be commensurate with enlisted members throughout the Air Force.  2.1.7.1.  When there are special events, duty hours may be adjusted and if necessary, compen-satory time should be provided. AFI36-2123   2 OCTOBER 200832.1.8.

For others this may not be the case; however, given the wide range ofrequirements, it is incumbent on the general officer to outline expectations and establish a trainingplan commensurate with the needs of the general officer’s responsibilities.  As such the generalofficer may direct the preparation of specific meal plans and establish some form of training thatencompasses the full range of requirements (small and large events). Training events must be rea-sonably and logically related to the overall military and official functions and duties of the generalofficer.
