The scope of training includes Introduction to Logistics, Basic Level Roles and Responsibilities, Supply, Fuels, Transportation, Vehicle Management, Logistics Plans, Life Cycle Logistics, and Capstone exercises.  3.0.  Non-AFSC Awarding Courses.  See Attachment 2 for additional logistics training and education opportunities.    16  PART II  SECTION C - SUPPORT MATERIAL  1.0.  Competency Training.  Designed to build on concepts taught at the Basic Course and applied at the unit level.  1.1.  Concept.  The intent of Competency training is to produce qualified Logistics Readiness Officers and award the 21R3 skill level.   Competency training consists of the tasks identified under the respective proficiencies in Charts 6-13.  1.2.  Master Training Plan.  The instructional design for unit level training is determined locally.   Unit training may include work center and field visits, task observations, classroom instruction, self-study, supervisor/commander interaction to meet training objectives.    1.3.  Training Documentation.    1.3.1.  Operation Officers/Squadron Commanders will review TBA with trainees at an initial interview within 60-days (120 Days for ARC) of the trainee’s assignment to the unit.  During the interview the supervisor and trainee will discuss task requirements. Document the initial interview in TBA notes.  1.3.2.  Operation Officers/Squadron Commanders will identify tasks the trainee will be required to complete.  As some installations may not have all the required equipment, supervisors will identify tasks able to be completed in TBA.  Any task that cannot be completed due to local limitations will be documented in TBA.  Every effort should be made by the trainee to meet the task requirement when able (TDY, loaner equipment, etc.).  1.3.3.  Operation Officers/Squadron Commanders will review training progress with trainees monthly until training is complete.  Documentation of this review will be in TBA.   1.3.4.  Basic Course Instructors will sign off on all the standard CFETP tasks on a hard copy and/or electronic one for the student’s parent unit to update TBA.     17  PART II  SECTION D – LRO PROFICIENCY TRAINING RECORD  1.0  The LRO Proficiency Training Record is comprised of proficiencies of Supply, Fuels, Transportation (Ground and Air), Logistics Plans, Life Cycle Logistics and Vehicle Management tasks.  The officer must be assigned to the work center for the required 12 months and complete the associated requirements for completion of the proficiency.  While not assigned to the corresponding work center, ARC members may gain and document experience while on Annual Tour or Seasoning Training. ARC Unit Commanders have discretion when evaluating the 12 month experience requirements based on the member’s experience and other factors.  Officers must accomplish all tasks in the area available on location (see note below) and have the same recorded in TBA by their trainer before they petition their squadron commander for completion of that proficiency.  The commander will determine if a trainee requires remedial training before approving a proficiency area completion.  NOTE:  If the process is not available at a particular location, trainers may line through and initial the process area.  This action will waive the requirement for that specific process.  However, commanders must review/verify each lined through item prior to considering for upgrade to 21R3 and submitting an AF Form 2096.  2.0.  How to Use the LRO Training Record:   The commander/supervisor should use task experts to conduct LRO Proficiency training.  Upon completion of training, the trainer should make appropriate annotations in TBA.    3.0.  LRO Orientation Program:  The objective of this program is to provide a foundation for successful completion of the Basic Course.  LOOP should occur immediately upon arrival at first duty assignment, but must be completed before attending the Basic Course.  LOOP is a Squadron Commander’s program and should consist of an initial interview and a detailed orientation of squadron functions and capabilities.     18   Chart 3.

Logistics Feasibility Assessment Capability (LOGFAC):  LOGFAC is the Air Force system of record used by Operations and Logistics planners to develop and plan requirements for wartime aircraft activity, wartime non munitions consumables, munitions requirements/distribution and global asset pre-positioning. In addition, it provides “What If” force supportability and asset visibility analysis and assessments. These capabilities provide a viable tool for the war fighter’s decision support and predictive analysis planning.  LOGFAC is the Air Force system serving as the Air Force War and Mobilization Plan, Volume 4 (WMP4) database and is used to compute War Consumables Distribution Objective (WCDO) consumables requirements. This is the Air Force War Reserve Materiel (WRM) program link to positioning of resources with theater air campaigns via the component AF WMP4/Wartime Aircraft Activity Report (WAAR). The WCDO is the only USAF approved document used to pre-position war consumables at or near the Planned Operating Base (POB) in support of AF forces. This deliberate planning document identifies “Worst Case” Operations Plans (OPLAN), Concept Plans (CONPLAN), and/or Plan Set requirements for all major categories of war consumables, i.e., POL products, munitions and miscellaneous items (film, non-explosive chaff, etc.). The LOGFAC system provides asset visibility and analysis capability for WRM assets. It provides support capability assessments for real world taskings as well as contingency scenarios, force supportability based on asset authorization, on-hand quantities and storage locations, and overall capability assessments. LOGFAC interfaces with the Combat Ammunition System (CAS), the Logistics Module (LOGMOD), Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Non-Nuclear Consumables Annual Analysis (NCAA), and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy through the Integrated Consumables Item Support (ICIS) Model. These capabilities provide an automated method to produce a Munitions WCDO and provide information to assist in publishing the Inventory Management Plan.  LOGFAC is less a force projection tool and more a force support tool, although it does calculate consumable requirements for force projection assets. It is used by operators and logisticians to generate employment and deployment aviation sorties in support of contingency planning efforts and to determine consumable requirements for those sorties.  Logistics Module (LOGMOD):  LOGMOD provides Air Force (AF), Major Commands (MAJCOMs), Base-Level Logistics Planners, and Base-Level Unit Deployment Managers (UDMs) with the capability to plan and execute deployment, reception, redeployment and forward deployments operations worldwide.  LOGMOD is the primary system for over 9,100K base-level users to perform planning, development, sustainment, and execution of UTCs for exercises, AEFs, and contingencies. LOGMOD provides1,513 logistics planners at Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard levels a web-based application for deployment deliberate planning and crisis action execution.  LOGMOD is crucial for logistics planners and UDMs to plan for worldwide deployment of personnel, supplies, and equipment to meet various exercises, contingencies, and wartime tasking.  It provides Air Force logistics planners a web-based logistics-planning program that receives and maintains cargo and personnel details for UTC Tasking.  It maintains detailed cargo records to include Transportation Tracking Account Number (TTAN) and Transportation Tracking Number (TTN) information as well as personnel records (levy file positions and the personnel file used to fill them).  It also provides a C2 capability through the LOGMOD schedule.  LOGMOD manages standard Unit Type Codes (UTCs) logistics details and assembles 64  contingency plan equipment requirements that provide personnel readiness tracking, scheduling, and monitoring capabilities.

Using the logistics core competencies, the strategic plan will develop, manage, and enable and retain the necessary skills to support the ever changing logistics environment.   The LRO competencies of Supply, and Deployment/Distribution and Transportation, originate from the Logistics Human Capital Strategy (LHCS). This strategic plan uses the competencies to highlight requisite experience for the LRO community to be aligned with the LHCS vision.   STRATEGIC COMPONENTS The goal of this plan is to balance the requirement for senior leaders with a broad logistics knowledge, and to retain leaders with depth in single proficiencies.   RECOMMENDATIONS Upon entry into the LRO career field, each officer will become intimately familiar with the CFETP, to include all its attachments. The developmental tools provided in this plan are meant to be used in conjunction with the CFETP to plan, manage, and control training and career planning.  This specialization track is to be a purposeful and focused career roadmap that supports career path progression across the key logistics competencies. The roadmap aims to provide additional context in the different career paths available. This knowledge will enable each LRO to research and identify the functional expertise required by the Air Force to generate senior logisticians who can perform at the operational level of war.   DEVELOPMENTAL TOOLS Individual career paths cannot be concretely defined by a working document; however, individual career progression can be facilitated by creating functional plans as a tracking mechanism to locate specific functional expertise. This will allow officers to tailor their development to individual career goals, ultimately enabling the Air Force to prepare officers to meet future logistics requirements.  The following visual roadmaps and AFPC-approved Assignment Paths depict suggested career progression for each proficiency and assignment planning. In addition to the complete list of all courses available to LROs in attachment two, each roadmap also includes suggested assignments to facilitate the development of the proficiency. 72   Supply  Vehicle Management 73    Fuels  Deployment, Distribution and Transportation (DDT)  Transportation (Ground or Air)  74     Logistics Plans    75     ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  Ribbon Charts  The Ribbon Chart is a visual tool allowing officers to take a proactive approach to managing their career.
