On Station/Off Station.  Crews will be prepared for mission execution and are expected to be on station at the beginning of the time over target/terrain (TOT/T), and must be off station by the end of the TOT/T, unless there are circumstances beyond crew control. (T-3) 3.9.1.  A crewmember is considered to be “on-station” when conducting operations on tasked terrain  and  targets.    A  crewmember  is  considered  to  be  “off-station”  once  operations  on tasked  terrain  and  targets  have  concluded.”    Rationale:    clearly  articulate  On/Off  Station delineations. (T-3). 3.9.2.  A  crew  is  considered  to  be  “off  station”  when  a  crewmember  maneuvers  off  the assigned task and is no longer assigned to the terrain/target. Egress may be required to leave tasked  terrain  and/or  targets.  “Off  station”  indicates  that  the  crew  is  not  in  position  or  no longer performing assigned tasks. (T-3) 3.10.  Vulnerability  (VUL)  Window.  Crews  are  bounded  by  the  VUL  window.  Deviations from the assigned VUL window must be coordinated through the ACD-CC and approved by the tasking authority. (T-3) 3.11.  Abort/Knock-it-off.  A tactical commander may declare a knock-it-off (training use only) or abort (cease action/event/mission). (T-3) 3.12.  Dynamic  Targeting.  Ad  hoc  and/or  emerging  target  tasking  can  occur.  During  tasked missions,  an  operator  may  identify  and  report  something  that  may  require  ad  hoc  or  dynamic targeting/retasking.  Dynamic  retasking  allows  modification  of  the  mission  to  support  changing mission  objectives.  This  includes  everything  from  retasking  the  operator  within  the  mission requirements  to  an  entirely  new  mission  that  is  added  to  the  daily  tasking  order.  Retasking  is accomplished through the tasking authority. (T-3) 3.13.  Communications  and  Crew  Coordination.  Recorded crew communications are official communications and all crews should be aware they have no expectation of privacy. (T-3) 3.13.1.  Sterile  Ops  Floor.  Limit  conversation  through  official  communication  channels  to that which is essential for crew coordination and mission accomplishment. (T-3) 3.13.2.  Advisory  Calls.  The  operator  performing  the  execution  will  periodically  announce their intentions during the critical checkpoints/phases of operations and when circumstances require deviating from normal procedures. (T-3) 3.13.3.  Common brevity codes may be found in the current SPINs. (T-3)   AFI17-2ACDV3  27 APRIL 2017 11 3.13.4.  Communications. 3.13.4.1.  Mission  execution  requires  at  least  one  method  of  communication  for  all operations. (T-3) 3.13.4.2.  The  ACD-CC  is  responsible  for  developing  and  briefing  the  communication plan. (T-3) 3.13.4.3.  Communications  planning  is  performed  to  determine  who  should  talk,  when and via what medium. (T-3) 3.13.4.4.  The  ACD-CC  will  ensure  a  designated  crewmember  monitors  all  primary comms unless otherwise directed, during all phases of operations. (T-3) 3.13.4.5.  An example Communications Planning Guide is included in Attachment 4. 3.14.  Mission Report (MISREP).  The ACD-CC is responsible for providing timely, accurate, and correctly formatted reports to tasking authority. (T-3) 3.14.1.  Tasking authorities, future missions and debriefs rely on accurate, timely MISREPs. All MISREPs will be completed IAW tasking authority guidance. 3.14.2.  Complete the MISREP once the crew completes a mission or specific mission phase IAW guidance/tasking. 3.14.3.  The  ACD-CC  is  responsible  for  reviewing  the  MISREP  for  accuracy  and completeness and submission to tasking authority. (T-3) 3.14.4.  Each member, section, or element lead on the crew is responsible for providing the appropriate data regarding their mission area. (T-3) 3.14.5.  Units may develop local procedures/templates to ensure standardization of reporting. (T-3) 3.15.  Crew  Changeover.  Direct  crew  changeover  only  applies  if  crews  are  performing  24/7 operations.  If  24/7  operations  are  not  occurring  then  the  crew  changeover  briefing  will  be incorporated into the next day’s pre-mission briefing. Crew members from the off-going and on-coming  sorties  during  a  multi-sortie  day  will  participate  in  a  crew  changeover  briefing.  At  a minimum,  the  changeover  will  include  all  items  previously  identified  for  the  pre-mission briefing. (T-3) 3.16.  Debriefing. 3.16.1.  All missions will be debriefed. (T-3) 3.16.2.  The ACD-CC is responsible for leading the crew debriefs. (T-3) 3.16.3.  Debriefs will cover all aspects of the mission (planning, briefing and execution) and ensure  all  participants  receive  feedback  through  the  development  of  Lessons  Learned  (LL) and Learning Points (LP). (T-3) 3.16.4.  Debrief  will  cover  crewmember  responsibilities,  deconfliction,  tactical  employment priorities and task management. (T-3) 3.16.5.  ACD-CC  will  review  the  record  of  all  tactical  portions  of  the  sortie  to  assess members’ effectiveness. (T-3) 12 AFI17-2ACDV3  27 APRIL 2017 3.16.6.  An example debriefing guide can be found in Attachment 3. 3.17.  Post Mission Duties. 3.17.1.
