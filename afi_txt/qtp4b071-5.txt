Specific Techniques: Criterion Objective: Notes: Conducts hands-on training and evaluation of operation of equipment with verification of steps.  Given a CDS kit, demonstrate how to prepare and perform the Set I (for S-Mustard, Phosgene, Hydrogen Cyanide, Lewisite, and N-Mustard) and Set V (for Nerve Agents, Phosgene, Cyanogen Chloride, Chlorine, and S-Mustard) Simultest sets successfully completing all checklist items with no trainer assistance.  *The CDS kit has two different 5-tube Simultest sets (Sets I and V) that can identify various nerve, blood, lung, nose and throat irritating agents. Each test takes less than five minutes to complete and does not require warm-up time or calibration.      1 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  PUMP LEAK TEST: 1.  Insert an unopened detector tube into the pump socket. 2.  Squeeze the pump completely and release. 3.  After 15 minutes, look for the end-of-stroke indicator.1 4.  If the pump is deemed leak-proof, remove the tube and reset the counter on the pump to zero.   PREPARE AND OPERATE ACCURO® PUMP WITH DETECTOR TUBES: 1.  Determine which set tubes will be used for sampling.2 2.  Open detector tubes only on pump side first (direction of arrow). 3 3.  Insert the open ends of the tube(s) into the tube adapter (flow arrows pointing in). 4.  Score and break off tips on other side of set.  5.  Activate the cyanogen chloride tube (Simultest Set V only).4 6.  Connect the tube set to pump.5 7.  Check stroke number.6 8.  Operate the pump.7 9.  Complete sampling.8 10.  Remove the used tubes from the adapter and dispose of them correctly.9 11.  Purge pump.10  RECORD DATA: 1.  Utilize DOEHRS or equivalent as applicable.     LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: N/A  NOTES: 1.  If the end-of-stroke indicator does not appear, the pump is leak-proof and you are ready to continue. If the end-of-stroke indicator appears, your pump is not leak-proof and therefore should not be used.   2.  Some tubes contain ampoules that require additional steps, in these circumstances, refer to laminated card for specific instructions. The laminated instruction cards provide a quick reference for easy use and color change interpretations specific to each ampoule (detector tube). The laminated instruction cards also provide reference for groups of related contaminants.  3.  Tube Opener Procedures:  A.  Simultest Tube Opener:   Carefully scrape the ceramic edge of the tube set opener against the ends of the tubes (at an angle) multiple times to score all five glass tips.   With the ceramic cutter UP, push opener completely over rubber tube block and apply pressure down  2 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  until all tube tips break off (if some tubes don’t break off, re-scrape or use the singe-tube breaker, described below).   B.  Deluxe Tube Opener (for individual tubes): Insert the tube into the cutter. Keep it pressed against the ceramic edge while turning it (scoring it).    To open the tube, insert the tube into the opener and push on it at an angle until the tip breaks off (dispose of glass tip).  C.  Pump Tube Opener (for individual tubes):   To score and open an individual tube using the opener on the Accuro® pump; insert the tube into the opener. Press the tube against the ceramic edge while turning it to score the glass; then pull the tube at an angle until the tip breaks off (dispose of glass tip).    When using the pump to open a tube, be sure to keep the pump facing downwards to prevent any glass splinters from entering the pump.   4.  Before beginning the test using the Simultest Set V detector tubes, you will need to activate the cyanogen chloride tube. Remove the tub from the holder and bend the tube between the two black dots, allowing the reagent to flow onto the indicator until it is moistened. Place the tube back into the test holder, always keeping the arrows on the tube pointing towards the pump.   5.  A special adapter is used to connect the Simultest Set to the pump. This adapter consists of a 5-slot manifold for the tube sets, 1 meter extension hose that connects to the Accuro® pump.  6.  The number of strokes required is stated on the back of the Simultest Set holder and is also included in the Instructions for Use. Conveniently, both Simultest Set I and V require 50 strokes.   7.  Grip and hold the Accuro® pump so that the end-of-stroke indicator and stroke counter are facing you. Squeeze the pump until it is fully compressed (the stroke indicator will advance) then release to allow the bellows to re-expand by itself until. A white dot reappears on the top of the pump and indicates re-expansion is complete (end of stroke).   8.  Repeat STEP 6 until the number on the stroke counter corresponds to the number of required strokes.   9.  All tubes, even those with negative results, cannot be reused and must be disposed of as hazardous waste.   10.  The Accuro® pump must be purged after every use, regardless of test results. Flush out the pump by performing a few pump strokes (STEP 6) in clean air.         3 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS  STS Line Item 4.5.2.6.1:  Detector Tubes or Chips (Draeger Civil Defense Simultest Kit)     1.

Given a TVA 1000B, perform calibration and functional check on the analyzer, demonstrating how to operate the analyzer successfully completing all the checklist items with limited no trainer assistance.  *  The TVA-1000B Toxic Vapor Analyzer is a direct reading portable monitor that can display, monitor, and log data in either a flame ionization detector (FID), a photo ionization detector (PID), or both simultaneously to provide real-time measurements of organic, and some inorganic, vapor concentrations in air. It cannot confidently determine unknowns at low ppm (parts per million). Therefore, in these types of situations it is recommended that the analyzer be used more for approximations when exact concentrations are not required.       8 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  BEFORE STARTING THE UNIT, PERFORM THE FOLLOWING STEPS:* 1.

Take background reading. 31.  Conduct monitoring. 32.  Record data. 33.  Power down unit. 5 34.  Remove the hydrogen gas tank from the side of the instrument (if using FID). RECORD DATA 1.   Utilize DOEHRS or equivalent as applicable.     9 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  The sample probe assembly is a hand-held device that enables you to take vapor samples at precise locations. It connects to the instrument by means of an umbilical. The umbilical has two quick-disconnect fasteners (one electrical, one sample line) at the instrument end.  2.  The FID mode is used to detect most organic compounds and can be used to detect gaseous hydrocarbons in depressions or confined spaces. It is best suited to detect combustible compounds such as gasoline and methane. The PID mode is sensitive to compounds with double bonds, such as aromatic and chlorinated compounds. It can also measure some inorganic compounds that the FID does not detect, such as ammonia, carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylamine, formaldehyde, and hydrogen sulfide. Calibration must be completed each day the TVA-1000B is used. The FID is calibrated with methane and the PID is calibrated with isobutylene.   To refill the hydrogen tank, follow these steps: 1.  Turn the supply tank valve to OFF. 2.  Attach the tank filler adapter to the supply cylinder with valve and manifold valves in OFF position. 3.  Attach the TVA-1000B hydrogen tank to the tank filler adapter (left hand thread-do not over tighten). 4.  Open the supply tank valve. 5.  Move the fill adapter valve to FILL position. 6.  Wait for TVA-1000B tank to fill (may take two to three minutes because of flow restrictors in the tank and fill adapter). Do not fill past 2200psi. 7.  Once full, close the fill adapter valve. 8.  Remove the TVA-1000B tank. 9.  Close the supply cylinder valve. 10.  Reopen the adapter valve to release gas remaining in tank fill adapter (removes pressure and makes adapter removal easier). 11.  Remove the tank fill adapter. (Always remove tank from instrument for storage.)    3.  Calibration must be completed each day the TVA-1000B is used. Prior to performing calibration, the instrument must be on and warmed up for approximately 30 minutes. The pump must be ON, the PID lamp must be ON, and the FID must be ignited throughout the warm-up period.   4.  If PID only, enter concentration of isobutylene. If FID only, enter concentration of methane. If dual, enter concentration of both gases.  5.  To power down this instrument, press and hold the OFF key. With FID versions, you must also shut off the gas valve to avoid depleting the tank supply.    10 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  TVA-1000B  *Key Functions:  ON:  The ON key enables power from the battery to the instrument. OFF: The OFF key disables power from the battery to the instrument. CONTROL: The CONTROL key is multi-function and is used to turn the pump, PID, and FID:  on or off, and to ignite the FID.

Which detector(s) within the TVA-1000B is/are able to distinguish inorganic material?    A:  Photoionization Detector  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B) 2.  How should the TVA-1000B be decontaminated?    A:  The TVA-1000B can be decontaminated by wiping the exterior with a moist towel.  Do NOT decontaminate the TVA-1000B by submerging it in water.  If the TVA-1000B is accidentally contaminated by drawing a liquid sample into the probe head, it is recommended to call the manufacturer, Thermo Fisher Scientific.  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B)  3.  How does the ion potential (IP) directly relate to the detection capabilities of the TVA-1000B?    A:  Dependent upon what lamp (10.6 eV or 11.8 eV) is installed for the PID will correlate to the detection of the chemical in question.  For example, acetaldehyde has an IP of 10.21 therefore it can be detected by either a 10.6 eV or an 11.8 eV PID lamp but chlorine has an IP of 11.47 so it cannot be detected by the 10.6 eV.  An 11.8eV lamp would have to be used.  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B)  4.  How is the response factor calculated?    A:  Response Factor = Actual Concentration / Measured Concentration  (Source: Bioenvironmental Engineer’s Guide to TVA-1000B)  16     AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling      STS Line Item 4.5.2.6.3:  Portable GC/MS (HAPSITE®)* TRAINER GUIDANCE Proficiency Code: 3c PC Definition: Can do all parts of the task.

Criterion Objective: Given a HAPSITE® (GC/MS), perform pre-operational check and operate instrument successfully completing all checklist items with NO trainer assistance. Notes: *The HAPSITE® is a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) proven to provide verifiable data for critical health-risk decisions. The HAPSITE® systems deliver fast, dependable on-site analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in air, water, and soil for emergency response, environmental, hazardous waste, industrial hygiene, process monitoring, and medical applications. The HAPSITE® Headspace sampling system supports the HAPSITE® Smart Chemical Identification System in detecting and identifying VOCs in water or soil on-site or from another location.  INFICON recommends storing the HAPSITE® Smart in extended standby mode. This keeps the NEG (pump) operating at 400°C and the ion pump ON to maintain proper vacuum conditions. Extended standby ensures the battery is charged and ready for deployment/response. While extended standby is recommended, it is not a substitute for system use and it is not a feature to extend the time period between system operations. Using the system or running a weekly Blank Run is the best method to ensure overall operational readiness.  The Guidance Document (HAPSITE® Field Guide) referenced above is designed to provide user’s the capability to maximize the use of deployment technology at both garrison and deployed environments in both routine and emergency response situations.

Time and date (if data logging option installed)    e.  Last CAL date (if data logging option installed) —The Sirius® Multigas Detector is equipped with a “last successful calibration date” feature. The date shown is the last date that all installed sensors were successfully calibrated. LAST CAL is displayed with this date in the following format: MM/DD/YY f. Instrument warm-up period g.  Fresh Air Setup (FAS) option.  2. Persons responsible for the use of the Sirius® Multigas Detector must determine whether or not the Fresh Air Setup option should be used. The user's abilities, training and normal work practices must be considered when making this decision. Warning: Do not activate the Fresh Air Setup unless you are certain you are in fresh, uncontaminated air; otherwise, inaccurate readings can occur which can falsely indicate that a hazardous atmosphere is safe. If you have any doubts as to the quality of the surrounding air, do not use the Fresh Air Setup feature. Do not use the Fresh Air Setup as a substitute for daily calibration checks. The calibration check is required to verify span accuracy. Failure to follow this warning can result in serious personal injury or death.  To perform a Fresh Air Setup, push the ON/OFF button while ZERO? is flashing. The Fresh Air Setup (FAS) has limits. If a hazardous level of gas is present, the Sirius® Multigas Detector ignores the FAS command and goes into alarm. Once the instrument self check is complete, ZERO? flashes for 10 seconds.  If no buttons are pushed, the ZERO? automatically stops flashing after the 10 seconds have expired and the FAS is not performed. To immediately skip the FAS, push the RESET/       button.   3. The pump motor will start fast and then slows down as the instrument adjusts the power to run the pump.  4. If the pump motor shuts down and an alarm sounds, PUMP ALARM will flash on the display and the readings on the display may change. When the pump inlet, sample line or probe is blocked, the pump alarm must activate. If the alarm does not activate, check the sample line and probe for leaks. Once leak is fixed, re-check pump alarm by blocking flow.   5. Warning: Perform a blocked flow test before each day’s use. Do not use the pump, sample line, or probe unless the pump alarm activates when the flow is blocked. Lack of an alarm is an indication that a sample may not be drawn to the sensors, which could cause inaccurate readings. Failure to follow the above can result in serious personal injury or death.  During operation, a pump alarm may occur when the flow system is blocked, pump is inoperative, and sample lines are attached or removed.  When the instrument is in a gas alarm, the pump alarm may not display until gas alarm is cleared.  6. The presence of other calibration gases may cause the PID to under range, indicated by dashes for the displayed VOC reading.   35 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  7. The reading on the Sirius® Multigas Detector display should be within the limits stated on the calibration cylinder or limits which are predetermined by the user. If necessary, change cylinder to introduce other calibration gases. If readings are not within these limits, the Sirius Multigas Detector requires recalibration.    8. Instrument must be in fresh air to perform the zero. CAL ZERO flashes. To skip the Zero procedure and move directly to the calibration span procedure, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, the instrument returns to the Measure mode. Once the zeros are set, CAL SPAN? flashes    9. CAL SPAN flashes for approximately 90 seconds. If autocalibration sequence passes, the instrument beeps three times and returns to the Measure mode. To skip calibration and return to the Measure mode, push the RESET/       button. If no button is pushed for 30 seconds, it will return to the Measure page.    10.  Warning: Never let the end of the sampling line touch or go under any liquid surface. If liquid is sucked into the instrument, readings will be inaccurate and the instrument could be damaged. We recommend the use of an MSA Sample Probe (P/N 10042621, 10042622, 10040589, or equivalent) containing a special membrane filter, permeable to gas but impermeable to water, to prevent such an occurrence. The Sirius® Multigas Detector can be equipped to detect combustible gases in the atmosphere.  a.  Alarms sound when concentrations reach:      i. ii.

Calibrate the Sirius Detector using isobutylene as the span gas.  2.  On the monitor, set the sample gas name to isobutylene.  3.  Apply a known concentration of the target chemical to the monitor and note the concentration reported in the display. 4.  The response factor for the target chemical relative to isobutylene: RF target gas =      Actual known concentration                              Concentration reported by instrument    For example:  A monitor is calibrated on isobutylene, and has isobutylene defined as the sample gas. When sampling 106 ppm of benzene in air, the instrument reports a concentration of 200 ppm. In this example, the response factor for benzene relative to isobutylene would be:  RF benz = 106 ppm known conc. benzene = 0.53                        200 ppm reported  When surveying, if benzene is selected as the sample gas in the Response Factor page, and 0.53 is entered into the monitor as the response factor, the instrument would use this response factor to automatically correct the displayed concentration into PPM benzene.  If a chemical has a response factor between zero and one, the monitor has a higher detector response for this chemical than isobutylene. If the response factor is greater than one, the monitor has a lower detector response for this chemical than isobutylene.    11. The STEL alarm is calculated over a 15-minute exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • Assume the detector has been running for at least 15 minutes:  • 15-minute exposure of 35 PPM:  (15 minutes x 35 PPM) = 35 PPM 15 minutes  • 10-minute exposure of 35 PPM  • 5-minute exposure of 15 PPM:  (10 minutes x 35 PPM) + (5 minutes x 15 PPM) = 28 PPM 15 minutes 37       AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling    12. The TWA alarm is calculated over an eight-hour exposure. Calculation examples are as follows:  • 1-hour exposure of 50 PPM:  (1 hour x 50 PPM) + (7 hours x 0 PPM) = 6.25 PPM 8 hours   • 4-hour exposure of 50 PPM 4-hour exposure of 100 PPM:  (4 hours x 50 PPM) + (4 hours x100 PPM) = 75 PPM 8 hours   • 12-hour exposure of 100 PPM:  (12 hours x 100 PPM) = 150 PPM 8 hours   NOTE: The accumulated reading is always divided by eight hours.

Criterion Objective: Given a sampling data scenario, calculate equivalent OEELs successfully completing all checklist items with no trainer assistance. Notes: *OEELs are based on the assumption that exposure occurs for an 8-hour period after which the body is no longer exposed but allowed to recover for the next 16 hours. Where the worker is exposed for more than 8-hours in a day, these assumptions do not hold true. Numerous biological factors come into play when adjusting the OEEL. The booklet produced each year by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienist (ACGIH), Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) and Biological Exposure Indices (BEIs), should be consulted to ensure it is appropriate to adjust the limit. For example, it is unnecessary to adjust limits where they are based on odor. Although limits can be adjusted downwards to accommodate longer periods of exposure, standards can never be adjusted upwards to accommodate shorter periods of exposure.       42 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  1.

Criterion Objective: Given sampling results, convert concentrations successfully completing all checklist items with no trainer assistance.  Notes: *When you receive your air sampling results back from the analytical laboratory, in most cases you will need to calculate the TWA and compare the results to the applicable OEEL. For those cases where the laboratory uses the air volume you provided and calculates the concentration in milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) or parts per million (ppm), at normal temperature and pressure (NTP), no corrections are required; you can simply compare your results directly to the applicable OEEL as long as the OEEL is in the same units. If the units are not the same, you will need to use one of the formulas provided below to convert to the same units as the OEEL:  mg/m3 or ppm.   In situations where the laboratory reported your results as a weight of contaminant collected on the sample media, such as milligrams (mg) or micrograms (µg), these results cannot be compared to the OEEL. When this happens, you must first determine the volume of air drawn through the sample then calculate the mass/volume concentration in mg/m3.   Remember, the units must be the same in order to make a comparison.      48 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling   TASK STEPS  1.

Obtain laboratory results of analyte(s) sample 2. Determine the standard concentration of the analyte(s) and the sampling procedure information1 3. Identify the sampling and analytical error (SAE) factor for the analyte(s) 2 4. Calculate the upper confidence limit (UCL) 3 5. Calculate the lower confidence limit (LCL) 4 6. Recognize when the OEEL could be exceeded5 7. Utilize OEHMIS (DOEHRS or equivalent), as applicable.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:     NOTES:   1. The standardized concentration of an analyte takes into consideration random fluctuations of its presence throughout the sampling process. This variation is expressed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as S rT which is an equivalent term indicating the measure of precision. It can be found in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods. The standardized concentration, therefore, can be expressed by the following formula where Y equals standardized concentration and X equals the full period sampling result obtained in step one:                Y =    X                     OEEL  The occupational exposure limit can be found in the ACGIH TLV Booklet. It is expressed as either a time-weighted average (TWA) or as a short-term exposure limit (STEL). The sampling results obtained will determine which value to use based on the sampling procedure.  2. The SAE is expressed by multiplying the precision measurement obtained in the NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods by the statistical constant 1.645. In other words, an SAE is found by the SrT multiplied by 1.645, e.g., the SAE of Stoddard solvent is 0.082 (SrT = 0.05 x 1.645).  SAE = SrT   x 1.645  3. The formula to calculate the upper confidence level (UCL) is the following:  UCL = Y + SAE   If the sampling process consists of multiple consecutive samples instead of one continuous sample, the formula is different:  𝑈𝐶𝐿 = 𝑌 +  𝑆𝐴𝐸 √(𝑇1𝑋1)2 +   (𝑇2𝑋2)2 +   … (𝑇𝑛𝑋𝑛)2𝑂𝐸𝐸𝐿 (𝑇1 +   𝑇2 + … 𝑇𝑛) Tn = Time of each sample 56   AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  Xn = Concentration of each sample   4. The formula to calculate the lower confidence limit (LCL) is as follows:  LCL = Y – SAE  Again, if the sampling process consists of multiple consecutive samples instead of one continuous sample, the formula is different:  𝐿𝐶𝐿 = 𝑌 −  𝑆𝐴𝐸 √(𝑇1𝑋1)2 +   (𝑇2𝑋2)2 +   … (𝑇𝑛𝑋𝑛)2𝑂𝐸𝐸𝐿 (𝑇1 +   𝑇2 + … 𝑇𝑛)    Tn = Time of each sample Xn = Concentration of each sample  5. If the TWA is already above the OEEL, there is no need to calculate the UCL; however, an LCL should be calculated. If the SAE results in a UCL of more than 1, it is not clear whether the exposure was in compliance. An error of method could make it unclear as to if the exposure was too high.     If the UCL < 1, it is with 95 percent confidence that an overexposure does not exist. If the LCL < 1 and the UCL> 1, it is not certain, so may be classified as a possible overexposure. If the LCL > 1, it is with 95 percent confidence that an overexposure exists.         57 AFQTP 4B071-5                Craftsman Training Guide:  Occupational & Environmental Air/Gas Sampling  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS     STS Line Item 4.5.2.13:  Calculate upper and lower confidence limits 1.

What needs to be done if the laboratory report only lists a mass of constituent, and did not report a concentration for a sample?   A:  Concentration can be calculated by dividing the mass reported by the total volume of air sampled.   (Source:  4B051 CDC)  2.  Why does air flow rate have to be converted from Liters (L) to cubic meters (m³)?   A:  OEELs and TWA calculations rely on volume in units of m3; therefore, liters must be converted to cubic meters (m3).   (Source:  4B051 CDC)  3.  Why do we have to accomplish censored data analysis?  A:  When you ignore or omit the data your estimated mean will be biased high and by setting to zero, the estimated mean will be biased too low.
