Install retriever assist strap (RAS/roller system) around static line(s) under retriever sling assembly ensuring quick-snap fittings are re-connected between "A" frame center anchor cable support and anchor cable stop at FS 770 on outboard anchor cable.  2.  Install retriever sling assembly around parachutist static line(s) and pull sling loop tight with retrieval sling hook.    3.  Fold in jump platform and initiate retrieval.  a.  If the aircraft has been modified with the slip clutch assembly to the static line retriever winch, engage static line retriever winch until it slips.  If the retriever clutch slips prior to bringing the parachutist into the paratroop door area, determine and remove the cause of the overload, slightly unwind the static line retriever winch to reset the winch’s slip clutch, and continue retrieval operation.  WARNING:  (T-1)  During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time.  This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.        b.  Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D-              bags begins to pass through the RAS.  4.  As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand, close and secure paratroop door.                         AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                               21  a.  If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g., positioned          in the lower aft corner of the paratroop door) it will become       necessary to pull the D-bags manually through the RAS.  The     primary loadmaster maintains control of the static line     retriever pistol grip.  The secondary loadmaster (if available)     or safety observer/jumpmaster (if also onboard) routes D-bags     through the RAS.  WARNING:  (T-1)  All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.        b.  After D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually             pull them far enough forward so as not to interfere with the            remaining retrieval.        c.  As the parachutist is pulled up to the paratroop door, swing            parachutist into the aircraft by hand, close and lock             paratroop door.  5.  After retrieving the parachutist, reset flaps to 50 percent, raise the landing gear, and accomplish the completion of drop checklist.  Paratroop Retrieval Bar: 1.  Install the parachutist retrieval bar in the paratroop door.  One end of the bar is inserted in the retaining bracket on the aft portion of the door frame.  The other end of the bar is then carefully raised and inserted on the forward portion on the door frame.  2.  Fold in the jump platform.  3.  Using the static line retriever, retrieve the static lines over the bar.                             22                              AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                                         4.  The loadmaster initiates retrieval using the static line retriever winch.  WARNING:  (T-1)  During retrieval attempts, take all possible action to ensure the parachutist does not slip back at any time.  This does not preclude unwinding the static line retriever to reset the slip clutch, if necessary.        a.  Stop retrieval when the cotton sleeve at the apex of the D            bags begins to pass over the paratroop retrieval bar.  5.  As the parachutist is pulled up to the door, swing parachutist into the aircraft by hand.       a.  If the parachutist is not in the paratroop door, (e.g.,            positioned in the lower aft corner of the paratroop door) it            will become necessary to pull the D-bags manually through            the opening between the retrieval bar and the paratroop door.             One loadmaster maintains control of the static line retriever            pistol grip.  Another loadmaster, safety observer or            jumpmaster routes the D-bags through the opening.  WARNING:  (T-1)  All personnel should remain clear of the paratroop door and line of travel of the static line retriever cable until the parachutist has been retrieved into the door.  Once D-bags have been brought into the aircraft, manually pull them far enough forward so as not to interfere with the remaining retrieval.  NOTE:  When the parachutist is in the door area and is being controlled by the loadmaster/safety observer/jumpmaster, slightly  unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the static line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.                        AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                               23  6.  After retrieving the parachutist, accomplish the completion of drop checklist.  5,000 lb. Tie-down Strap:  1.  The loadmaster folds the jump platform in.  2.  Install a 5,000 lb.  tie-down strap across the paratroop door by threading the hook end of the strap behind the one-inch tubular brace located at FS 737, across the door under all static lines, and behind the one-inch tubular brace at FS 700.  Secure the hook end of the tie-down strap to a tie-down ring forward of FS 700 and ratchet end to any convenient tie-down ring aft of FS 737.  Remove as much slack as possible.  WARNING:  (T-1)  Use extreme caution when routing 5,000 lb.  strap over the oxygen regulators located at FS 740 left and right side.  3.  Push the static lines to the top of the paratroop door and remove additional slack in the tie-down strap by using the ratchet.  4.  Follow the procedures as indicated in the paratroop retrieval bar method starting with Step 3.      24                              AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                                                                    EMERGENCY PARACHUTIST RETRIEVAL PROCEDURES [Cargo Ramp and Door]   Aircraft Not Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tiedown Rings: 1.  Thread the hook end of a 5,000 lb.  tie-down strap, front to rear, around the right vertical support member at FS 840 approximately 5 1/2 feet above the ramp in the ADS position. 2.  Attach the hook end into the strap and draw taut.  3.  Run the ratchet end of the strap across the ramp and thread it, front to rear, around the left vertical -support member at FS 840.  4.  Remove all slack from the strap and attach the ratchet end to any convenient tie-down ring forward of FS 840.  Ratchet the strap until taut.  5.  Use the static line retriever to retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp, bring parachutist into the aircraft by hand under the strap.  WARNING:  (T-1)  The last 5 feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist.  A wildly oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first.  If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, then continue with the retrieval.  Repeat these stops continually, if required.  NOTE:  After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster/safety observer/loadmaster, slightly  unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.  6.  After retrieving the parachutist, accomplish the completion of drop checklist.                       AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                               25   CAUTION:  (T-1)  For aircraft equipped with ramp air deflectors, after the jumper has been successfully retrieved and secured, remove the 5000 pound strap prior to closing the aft cargo door and ramp.  Failure to do so will cause the ramp air deflectors to contact the strap causing damage to the aircraft or the strap to break.  Aircraft Modified with Quick-Retrieval Tiedown Rings: 1.  Attach hook end of the pre-positioned 5,000-pound tie-down strap facing forward to the tie-down ring on the side of the aircraft from which the parachutist is being towed.  Attach the ratchet end of the tie-down strap to the opposite tie-down ring and ratchet until at least two turns of webbing are around the spindle and strap is taut.  2.  Emergency retrieval tie-down strap will be pre-measured and excess taped prior to takeoff.  S-fold the excess strap and tape near the ratchet end of the strap with pressure-sensitive tape.  Pre-measure strap so with both ends connected to the tie-down rings and two wraps around the spindle, the excess strap remains securely taped.  Pre-position strap so that it is accessible if needed prior to take-off.  3.  Use the static-line retriever to retrieve the static lines over the strap and as the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp, bring the parachutist into the aircraft by hand underneath the strap.  WARNING:  (T-1)  The last five feet are the most crucial for the fouled parachutist.  A wildly oscillating parachutist usually strikes the aircraft ramp head first.  If the parachutist is oscillating violently, it may become necessary to stop the retrieval momentarily, allowing the parachutist to stabilize, then continue with the retrieval.  Repeat these stops continually, if required.                              26                              AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                                        NOTE:  After the parachutist is pulled up to the ramp and is being controlled by the jumpmaster/safety observer/loadmaster, slightly unwind the static line retriever to relieve tension on the line so the parachutist may be brought into the aircraft.  MANUAL STATIC LINE RETRIEVAL (Paratroop Door)  1.  Secure the hook end of 5,000 pound tie down strap to a point forward enough in the cargo compartment to permit static lines to enter completely into the aircraft.  2.  Insert the other end of the strap from the bottom up, making a "U" around the static lines.  3.  Pull the strap forward to retrieve the static lines into the aircraft.  Loadmasters may require assistance to pull the strap forward.  MANUAL STATIC LINE RETRIEVAL (Ramp and Door)  If the static line retriever fails following a combination/tailgate drop, use the following procedures using the Prusik Knot:  1.  Take a 30 inch piece of 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord that is tied in a loop.  Loop the cord around the static line retriever winch cable as shown in the figure.  Use a minimum of three wraps around the retriever cable to ensure locking of the 1/2- inch tubular nylon cord.  2.  Pull to tighten the knot around the retriever winch cable to prevent slipping.  Attach the hook end of a 5,000 lb.  tiedown strap into the loop’s end and pull in the static lines.  The 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord will remain locked in place under tension.                       AFI 11-2HC-130V3 CL-2                               27   3.  More than one 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord may be attached to the winch cable using the Prusik Knot to facilitate static line retrieval.  The Prusik Knot may be adjusted up or down the cable as required.  The knot will not slip as long as it is wrapped tightly with a minimum of three turns (more wraps equal more friction), and tension is applied.  4.  To prevent cutting the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord with the hook on the 5,000 lb.  tiedown strap, a carabineer may be attached to the 1/2-inch tubular nylon cord loop and the hook attached to the carabineer.  High Altitude Emergency Procedures 1.  Abort the mission 2.  Descend and Pressurize.  3.  Ensure the affected person remains on 100 percent oxygen until a medical doctor determines the type of treatment required. 4.  Proceed to a location where qualified medical assistance is available. 5.  Advise the controlling agency of the emergency and request an ambulance and doctor meet the aircraft. 6.  Advise attending physician to call USAF Hyperbaric Medicine Division; during duty hours call DSN 554-3483 or (210) 292-3483 and after duty hours call DSN 554-5990 or (210) 292-5990.
