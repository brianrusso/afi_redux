Description of the First Sergeant. 1.1.1.  The United States Air Force First Sergeant is an expeditionary leader serving in a time honored  special  duty  position,  rich  in  custom  and  tradition.    The  position  is  critical  to  the execution of the unit mission.  Although the first sergeant does not typically have a specific operational  or  technical  expertise  requirement,  he  or  she  must  thoroughly  understand  how decisions affect unit performance.  The first sergeant primarily supports the mission through interaction,  support  and  management  of  Airmen  and  families.    The  first  sergeant  works directly for and derives authority from the unit commander, and serves a critical link for the commander  within  the  unit.    The  first  sergeant  must  ensure  the  force  understands  the commander’s  policies,  goals,  and  objectives  and  must  also  ensure  support  agencies,  i.e., security forces, civil engineer, medical facilities, services, etc., are responsive to the needs of unit personnel and their families. 1.1.2.  First sergeants respond to the needs of unit members 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and may at times be required to work long and irregular hours, as well as travel extensively to  and  from  mission  destinations  (The  Joint  Travel  Regulation,  paragraph  2805,  authorizes vicinity travel).  They must remain vigilant and use the necessary authority to resolve issues that, left unchecked, would adversely impact readiness. 1.1.3.  The  first  sergeant  principally  leads  outside  the  operational  chain  of  command.    As such, first sergeants must be mindful they seldom are the ranking Senior Noncommissioned Officer  (SNCO)  in  the  unit,  and  should  balance  communication  with  the  organization’s leaders  while  taking  the  lead  in  establishing  effective  communication  with  all  members.  Specifically,  first  sergeants  communicate  with  unit  leadership,  supervisors  and  members  to ensure equitably is maintained and morale, welfare and health needs for the force are met. 1.1.4.  The first sergeant serves as the commander’s advisor on personnel programs, enlisted career  progression,  enlisted  Professional  Military  Education  (PME),  family  needs,  financial matters, housing and recognition. 1.1.5.  The first sergeant  is not a replacement for the chain of command.  The first sergeant must  ensure  leadership,  to  include  superintendents  and  supervisors,  are  actively  engaged  in the  interaction,  support  and  management  of  Airmen  and  their  families  through  inclusive involvement and communication. 1.2.  Professionalism.  First  sergeants  are  expected  to  epitomize  the  highest  qualities  of  Air Force  SNCOs.    These  qualities  require  the  first  sergeant  to  always  remain  perceptive  and credible, and to exemplify the core values of the United States Air Force.  First sergeants must be proactive in  the performance of their duties,  demonstrating initiative, innovation and character.  Instances  where  professionalism  comes  into  question  can  quickly  unravel  a  unit’s  morale  and ability  to  accomplish  the  mission.    First  sergeants  can  neither  maintain  friendships  or unprofessional relationships with any member of the unit, which could be perceived as showing or having any particular favoritism to an individual or portion of a unit to include both military and  civilian  members  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2909.    First  sergeants  must  be  cognizant  of  their   6  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 actions, to include the mere appearance of impropriety, as it relates to their position, unit and the Air Force. 1.3.  Relationships with Other Key Leaders. 1.3.1.  Commander.  The professional relationship between a first sergeant and commander is often unique and very close.  The first sergeant serves as a key advisor to the commander on matters relating to health, morale, welfare, safety, legal, personnel, administrative issues and a  variety  of  other  issues.    Furthermore,  the  first  sergeant  must  become  intimately  familiar with  the  unit  mission  to  ensure  this  advice  is  sound  in  relation  to  the  operational environment. There will be instances where the commander will expect the first sergeant to act on his or her behalf, and there is a great amount of trust placed in the first sergeant by the commander. 1.3.2.  Squadron  Superintendent.  The  first  sergeant  and  superintendent  must  establish  a strong  professional  relationship  and  define  roles  and  responsibilities,  as  these  often  cross paths.    Superintendents  are  primarily  operationally  focused,  while  the  first  sergeant  spends most  of  his  or  her  time  with  personnel  and  related  programs.    The  first  sergeant  and superintendent  must  keep  each  other  informed  on  matters  that  could  affect  an  Airmen’s ability to execute the mission. Superintendents must ensure the first sergeant understands the mission and operations of the unit, and they must work together to ensure the success of the unit. 1.3.3.  Wing and Installation Command Chief Master Sergeants (CCM). 1.3.3.1.  In  addition  to  responsibilities  and  obligations  at  the  unit  level,  first  sergeants work  closely  with  the  Wing  CCM  to  prepare  the  force  to  execute  the  Wing  and  base missions.    Furthermore,  in  several  instances  there  will  be  more  than  one  CCM  on  an installation,  and  the  first  sergeant  will  often  work  with  all  of  them,  especially  the installation host Wing CCM even if he or she is not the first sergeant’s Wing CCM.  In all  instances,  the  first  sergeant  and  CCMs  are  required  to  build  a  healthy  professional relationship and work together to enhance the installations missions. 1.3.3.2.  First  Sergeants  also  participate  in  a  variety  of  activities  that  support  the  total needs  of  the  military  community.    Due  to  the  first  sergeant’s  role  as  a  unit  leader, commanders  and  CCMs  must  ensure  installation  taskings,  First  Sergeant  Council activities,  as  well  as  private  organization  involvement  do  not  result  in  excessive  time away from the unit. 1.3.4.  Key Spouse.  The first sergeant helps the commander establish and maintain a strong Key Spouse program where applicable.  The first sergeant interacts with the key spouse on a regular  basis,  and  serves  as  the  liaison  between  the  key  spouse  and  unit  leaders.    Specific requirements with relation to the key spouse program are outlined in Chapter 2. AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   7  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

The interview should be of appropriate length and depth to  assess  nominee’s  understanding  of  responsibilities,  qualifications,  motivation, professional  appearance,  attitude  and  potential  to  successfully  assume  first  sergeant duties. 4.2.1.3.1.  A member’s  Wing CCM will review  the nominee’s  records for eligibility and interviews nominee for fitness to serve as a first sergeant. 4.2.1.3.2.  If  a  nominee  requires  a  family  care  plan  IAW  36-2908,  the  CCM  must discuss the time demands with the applicant and the effects on their plan and family care arrangements. 4.2.1.3.3.  The  CCM  determines  if  a  nominee’s  complete  mental,  emotional,  fitness and personal profile meets the requirements to be selected as a first sergeant. 4.2.1.3.4.  The CCM advises the nominee that upon selection, they may be assigned to any first sergeant position they are qualified for, and will discuss the initial 3 year tenure  along  with  the  intent  for  the  member  to  return  to  their  PAFSC  at  the completion  of  the  tenure.    The  possibilities  of  a  second  tenure  as  a  first  sergeant should also be discussed, but emphasized a second tenure will not be granted for the majority of SNCOs serving as first sergeants. 4.2.1.4.  Following  the  interview,  the  CCM  will  provide  a  recommendation  on  the application.   If  the  CCM  determines  the  nominee  is  not  fit  for  first  sergeant  duty,  the CCM  will  personally  discuss  the  specific  reason  for  denial  with  the  nominee,  and  will notify the nominee and unit commander of the decision in writing. 4.2.1.5.  If  the  member  is  recommended  by  the  CCM  for  first  sergeant  duty,  the  CCM forwards  the  electronic  application  to  the  Wing  commander  for  endorsement.   Once signed, the application is electronically submitted to the respective MAJCOM/DRU First Sergeant Functional Manager. 4.2.1.6.  The  MAJCOM/DRU  First  Sergeant  Functional  Manager  will  review  the accuracy  of  the  application,  as  well  as  provide  the  final  approval  concerning  the qualification of a member to serve as a first sergeant.  Disapprovals will be provided in writing  explaining  the  reasons  for  denial  and  opportunities  for  improvement.    If approved, the application will be forwarded to AFPC/DPAA2 for action.  Copies of the nominee’s EPRs and RIP will not be forwarded. 4.2.1.7.  AFPC/DPAA2  coordinates  AFSC  release  with Assignment Functional Area Manager (FAM). (T-1). the  nominee’s  CAFSC 4.2.1.7.1.  If the CAFSC Assignment FAM recommends non-release, they must first coordinate the specific non-release recommendation with their respective CFM. 4.2.1.7.2.  If  the  CFM  concurs  with  non-release,  they  must  discuss  the  specific recommendation with the USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager to include the AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   23  chronic/critical  status  of  their  AFSC,  specific  manning  projections,  as  well  as  a projected release date. 4.2.1.7.3.  Instances  where  a  nominee  is  not  released  for  first  sergeant  duty, AFPC/DPAA2 will notify the nominee, Wing CCM, MAJCOM/DRU First Sergeant Functional  Manager  and  the  USAF  First  Sergeant  Special  Duty  Manager  with specifics as to why the member was not released. 4.2.1.8.  Members  who  have  an  assignment  in  their  PAFSC  at  the  time  their  package reaches AFPC/DPAA2 will be disqualified for entry into the special duty. 4.2.1.9.  Members  who  are  currently  serving  an  enlistment  where  they  have  received  a bonus are not eligible to enter the 8F000 SDI.  When a member has served at least half of the  enlistment  they  received  a  bonus  for,  they  may  seek  a  waiver  for  release  IAW  AFI 36-2606, and some recoupment of previous bonuses may occur. 4.2.1.10.  AFPC/DPAA2 schedules nominee for the next available FSA class in line with the needs of the Air Force and applicant’s availability. (T-1). 4.2.1.10.1.  Nominee  will  normally  be  identified  for  8F000  duty  via  an  assignment notification during a normal assignment cycle. 4.2.1.10.2.  When local vacancies exist outside a normal assignment cycle, the Wing CCM  will identify the need to the MAJCOM who will work with AFPC/DPAA2 to fill vacancies.  Local utilization will be considered first,  and if no local  candidate is available, any candidate can be considered for an assignment to fill a valid AF need. 4.2.1.10.3.  AFPC/DPAA2  will  notify  the  applicant  and  MAJCOM/DRU  First Sergeant Functional Manager of approval, class dates and assignment.  4.2.2.  ANG.  For  ANG  candidates  and  continuity,  first  sergeant  selection  procedures  will begin 4-5 months prior to appointment to allow a 2-3 month transition period. First sergeant double  billeting  is  not  authorized.  The  incumbent  will  be  removed  from  the  first  sergeant UMD position and reassigned to another vacancy/position upon the selection and assignment of a new first sergeant. 4.2.2.1.  When  a  vacancy  exists  or  is  anticipated  in  a  first  sergeant  position,  the  CCM must ensure the MPF announces the position and discloses the application procedures and submission dates. (T-2). 4.2.2.2.  The CCM and MPF will confirm the qualifications of all applicants. The CCM reviews  applicant’s  records  for  eligibility  and  determines  if  the  applicant’s  total  profile supports  boarding  the  member.    Note:  The  CCM  will  insure  that  all  TSgt’s  who  are promotable to MSgt, IAW ANGI 36-2502 that are selected for an interview will sign the following  statement  as  a  condition  of  promotion  under  the  retraining  program;  “I acknowledge  I  am  being  selected  to  fill  a  First  Sergeant  position  and  I  am  being promoted  under  the  provisions  of  ANGI  36-2502,  paragraph  3.4.  Retraining  Promotion Program, before attending the FSA. I understand I must attend and successfully complete the FSA within one year of appointment as First Sergeant and remain/successfully serve in the position a minimum of 3 years. My failure to complete this requirement will result in a demotion in accordance with ANGI 36-2503, Administrative Demotion of Airman.”   24  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 4.2.2.3.  For first sergeant positions in the rank of MSgt, the CCM and MPF will schedule applicants  to  meet  the  selection  board.  The  board,  as  a  minimum,  will  consist  of  the CCM,  one  unit  first  sergeant,  and  a  SNCO  of  equal  or  higher  grade  than  the  applicant. The  Wing  Human  Resource  Advisor  (HRA)  will  act  as  an  advisor  to  the  board  unless assigned to the board by the CCM. Additionally, per the CCM discretion, a commander from a non-vacant unit may sit on the selection board. 4.2.2.3.1.  The  selection  board  conducts  a  comprehensive  interview  to  assess  the applicant’s motivation,  understanding of responsibilities, attitude, fitness, image  and ability to accomplish first sergeant duties. Board questions should be reviewed by the CCM prior to the board convening. 4.2.2.3.2.  The  selection  board  must  disqualify  any  applicant  who  does  not  meet USAF  and  ANG  standards,  with  particular  emphasis  on  AFI  36-2903  and  AFI  36-2905. 4.2.2.3.3.  Based on the results of the selection board, the CCM will prioritize a list of only  those  individuals  who  demonstrate  the  potential  to  assume  the  duties  of  first sergeant.  The  CCM  will  then  forward  the  list  to  the  unit  commander.  The  CCM should assist the unit commander in making the final selection. 4.2.2.3.4.  The applicant selected by the unit commander from the prioritized list will be  awarded  DAFSC  SDI  8F000  pending  completion  of  the  FSA.  TSgts  who  are selected must be promoted immediately upon assuming the position of first sergeant. Over-grades are not authorized. 4.2.2.4.  The selection of full-time personnel as first sergeants is governed by provisions in  ANGI 36-101, ANGI  36-2101, and TPR 303.  AGRs are only authorized to  serve as first  sergeants  in  AGR fulltime identified positions in  the ANG.  Technicians can serve through  the  ETP  process  as  described  in  the  aforementioned  TPR  303  instruction. Fulltime  personnel  may  serve  up  to  a  maximum  time  of  6  years  only  one  time  in  their careers. 4.2.2.5.  First sergeant positions assigned the rank of SMSgt require experience and will be open only to  those individuals who currently  possess/serve in  an 8F000 SDI and are promotable  to  SMSgt  by  the  close  of  the  announcement.  The  general  application  and selection procedures outlined in the ANG First Sergeant Guidance letter are applicable. 4.2.2.5.1.  The  CCM  and  MPF  will  schedule  applicants  to  meet  the  selection  board. The  board,  as  a  minimum,  will  consist  of  the  CCM  and  at  least  two  SMSgts  or CMSgts. The CCM should include the State CCM in the selection board if possible. The Wing HRA will advise the board unless otherwise assigned as a board member. 4.2.2.5.2.  The  selection  board  conducts  a  comprehensive  interview  to  assess  the applicant’s ability to assume the duties and responsibilities of the grade and position. Continued emphasis on standards as stated in AFI 36-2618 and AFI 36-2905 is also required. 4.2.2.5.3.  Based on the results of the selection board, the CCM will prioritize a list of those  first  sergeants  who  demonstrate  the  potential  to  assume  the  duties  and responsibilities of the grade and position. The CCM will then forward the list to the AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   25  Wing/unit commander. The CCM should assist the Wing/unit commander in making the final selection. 4.2.3.  AFR. First sergeant selection procedures will begin 4-5 months prior to appointment to  allow  for  a  transition  period.    First  sergeant  positions  may  utilize  Overage  Code  2  for  a period  of  90  days  with  an  anticipated  loss  due  to  retirement,  separation,  reassignment  or relocation; to enhance training and development during turnover within a squadron or Group. 4.2.3.1.  When  a  vacancy  exists  or  is  anticipated  in  a  first  sergeant  position,  the  CCM must ensure the MPS announces the position and discloses the application procedures and submission dates. (T-2). 4.2.3.2.  The  CCM  and  MPS  will  confirm  the  qualifications  of  all  applicants  IAW  AFI 36-2113.  The  CCM  will  interview  eligible  applicants  and  may  ask  or  allow  additional personnel  to  participate in  the interview, but  it will  not  be conducted as  a formal board process.  The  interview  should  be  of  appropriate  length  and  depth  to  assess  applicant’s understanding  of  responsibilities,  qualifications,  motivation,  professional  appearance, attitude  and  potential  to  successfully  assume  first  sergeant  duties.  The  interview  will disqualify any applicant who does not meet standards. 4.2.3.3.  The CCM advises the candidate that upon selection, they may be assigned to any first sergeant position they are qualified for; however, members must not be assigned to their  originating  unit  during  initial  placement.  At  a  minimum  the  CCM  will  advise  the member of the following developmental information: 4.2.3.3.1.  Additional  periods  beyond  the  mandatory  3  year  commitment,  in  the special  duty,  are  at  the  discretion  of  the  CCM  with  approval  from  the  Wing commander or equivalent. 4.2.3.3.2.  The maximum period an AFR first sergeant may occupy an 8F000 position within a single unit is  48 months and within the special duty is  84 months from  the date  assigned.    Participation  within  the  special  duty  past  the  84th  month,  from  the date  assigned  DAFSC  8F000,  must  be  at  the  recommendation  of  the  CCM  for  the purpose  of  development,  and  approved  by  the  AFR  First  Sergeant  Functional Manager. 4.2.3.3.3.  Airmen  returning  to  their  original  AFSC,  at  the  completion  of  their  first tour, and less than 84 months from the date assigned DAFSC 8F000, will be retained as an overage (Code 4) for up to 2 years. The Airman does not have to return to their originating unit for this rule to apply. 4.2.3.4.  Based on the results of the interview, the CCM will prioritize a list of only those individuals  who  demonstrate  the  potential  to  assume  the  duties  of  a  first  sergeant.  The CCM, or representative designated by the CCM, is responsible for coordinating with the unit commanders for initial assignments. 4.2.3.5.  The  nominee  who  is  recommended  by  the  CCM  in  coordination  with  the  unit commander,  and  selected  by  the  Wing  CC  or  equivalent  will  be  awarded  DAFSC  SDI 8F000  pending  completion  of  the  FSA.    They  are  not  authorized  to  wear  the  diamond device  until  completion  of  the  FSA.  Additionally,  the  applicant  selected  must  have  a minimum of 3 years remaining on their current enlistment prior to submitting a training   26  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 request  for  attendance  to  the  FSA.  Technical  sergeants  who  are  selected  must  be promoted immediately to master sergeant prior to attending the FSA. 4.2.3.6.

Members must have a minimum of 12 months experience in  the  SDI  from  the  FSA  graduation  date  to  be  eligible  for  SMSgt  positions,  and  36 months  experience  as  a  first  sergeant  to  be  eligible  for  CMSgt  first  sergeant  positions. Additionally,  individuals  must  meet  all  requirements  for  promotion  IAW  AFI  36-2502. The  CCM  is  responsible  for  coordinating  with  unit  commanders  prior  to  selection  and placement. (T-3). AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   27  Chapter 5 CLASSIFICATION & TRAINING 5.1.  AFSC  Award.  CAFSC,  DAFSC  and  PAFSC  guidance  is  outlined  in  AFI  36-2101  and ANGI 36-2101 for certain ANG personnel.  Specific criteria for the 8F000 SDI is as follows. 5.1.1.  CAFSC. All members will be awarded the 8F000 SDI as their CAFSC, effective the date they enter formal training (Distance Learning). Exception: ANG members who are in a full  time  status  of  another  AFSC  during  the  week  will  maintain  that  CAFSC,  but  perform duty in the 8F000 SDI while in drill status. 5.1.2.  DAFSC. Upon return from the FSA, members must be utilized and assigned as a first sergeant, and loaded into an authorized 8F000 UMD position where their DAFSC is 8F000.  Exceptions would be for members who return back to the losing duty station after completing the  FSA,  and  are  awaiting  PCS  to  their  first  8F000  duty  station.    ARC  members  may  be loaded in the DAFSC position of 8F000 prior to completing the FSA. 5.1.2.1.  ANG  AGR  members  who  are  full  time  in  another  career  field,  and  seek  to  do first  sergeant  duty  full  time  must  complete  a  waiver  to  NGB/CF  ANG  First  Sergeant Functional Manager IAW ANGI 36-101/ANGI 36-2101. 5.1.2.2.  ANG members who are in a full time status (i.e. Technicians) of another AFSC during the week will maintain that DAFSC, but perform duty in the 8F000 SDI while in drill status.  The full time DAFSC will be different due to their fulltime/DSG position and will be mismatched in the UMD. 5.1.2.3.    Personnel  who  successfully  complete  the  FSA  must  be  assigned  to  a  valid  8F000 UMD position and performing first sergeant duties to be authorized the diamond device (see Chapter  9).  Members  awaiting  PCS  to  their  first  8F000  duty  station  are  not  authorized  to wear the diamond device while preforming duties in their PAFSC. 5.1.3.  PAFSC. 5.1.3.1.  The member will retain the AFSC they are “most qualified in” as their PAFSC.  In most instances, it will be the AFSC from which they are entering the 8F000 SDI. 5.1.3.2.  IAW AFI 36-2101 six criteria are utilized to determine the PAFSC and include (in  order)  skill  level,  experience,  complexity,  amount  of  formal  education  and  training, currency of equipment and desire of the individual. 5.1.3.3.  The 8F000 SDI does not have skill levels.  The member will retain their 7-skill level from the losing career field for a period of 6 years and the AFSC for a period of 8 years.  For ANG members that serve full time in another AFSC (and 8F000 duties in drill status), they will maintain their PAFSC so long as they maintain their proficiency in their full-time position. 5.2.  FSA  Attendance.  Members selected for first  sergeant  duty  will be scheduled for the  first available class  date. AFPC/DPAA2 will schedule RegAF  members once a valid requirement is identified.  NGB/A1FT, Formal Training Branch, schedules FSA class dates for ANG members.  AFR/A1, Formal Schools Branch, schedules FSA class dates for AFR members.  AFR and ANG members must attend at the earliest possible opportunity, but no later than 1 year from the date of   28  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 assignment.    If  a  member  does  not  complete  the  FSA  within  1  year,  he/she  must  be  removed from the first sergeant position and returned to his/her previous AFSC and the projected training cancelled.  Note:  In  the  instance  that  a  member  has  been  approved  for  first  sergeant  duty,  but there  are  no  valid  positions  to  be  assigned,  the  member  will  not  receive  a  class  date  until  a vacancy is identified.   5.3.  USAF First Sergeant Academy. 5.3.1.  The  FSA  is  a  blended  learning  course  combining  a  period  of  distance  learning, followed  by  an  in-residence  portion.    Distance  learning  will  be  conducted  by  individual components;  however,  the  in-residence  portion  may  include  members  from  RegAF,  ANG and  AFR  components.    The  course  covers  a  wide  variety  of  topics  including  those  items identified during the most recent U&TW.  Most instruction is conducted with a blend of all components,  but  a  portion  is  designated  for  specific  instruction  on  topics  unique  to  each particular component as outlined during the most recent U&TW. 5.3.2.  RegAF members approved for first sergeant duty are released from their current duties upon start of the distance learning portion of the FSA.  During the distance learning portion of the FSA members in training will be assigned to shadow an 8F000 first sergeant outside the member’s current squadron.  If no other first sergeants are available, the member may be assigned  to  their  current  squadron  first  sergeant.  Exception:  Members  already  serving  as  a full time additional duty first sergeant may continue to do so as long as they are assigned an 8F000 first sergeant during the distance learning portion of the FSA. 5.3.2.1.  During  this  time,  the  member  should  complete  the  required  curriculum  and utilize the  first  sergeant  they  are  assigned  to  help  enhance  the  material.    They  will  also shadow the assigned first sergeant to garner experience. 5.3.2.2.  The first sergeant being shadowed will provide feedback to the CCM assessing the  ability  of  the  candidate  to  serve  as  a  first  sergeant.    If  at  any  time  during  the shadowing the CCM determines the  candidate is not  fit for first  sergeant duty they  will contact the MAJCOM Functional to discuss disenrollment. 5.3.3.  ARC  members  will  normally  already  be  assigned  to  the  8F000  billet,  and  may  be carrying out limited duties as necessary.  At the start of the distance learning portion of the course,  they  will  be  assigned  a  current  first  sergeant  as  a  mentor  to  facilitate  the  needs outlined in paragraph 5.3.2.1. 5.3.4.  Academic  Requirements.  Students  must  meet  all  academic  requirements  to  include oral, written and practical evaluations.  Personnel failing to meet standards may be removed from  the  course  at  the  discretion  of  the  FSA  Commandant  IAW  established  academy policies.  Students released may not be reenrolled for six months from the date of release. 5.3.5.  Fitness Requirements. 5.3.5.1.  Students will be required to take part in a strenuous fitness program to include a variety  of  physical  activities.      Students  who  arrive  without  the  required  fitness assessment  as  outlined  in  paragraph  3.2.13.2  will  be  immediately  returned  to  home station  at  the  unit’s  expense.    Rescheduling  attendance  requires  concurrence  from  the Commandant of the FSA, as well as the USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager (for AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   29  RegAF members),  ANG Functional  Manager (for  guard members) and AFR Functional Manager (for reserve members). 5.3.5.2.  Members  who  are  on  a  profile  are  required  to  coordinate  the  profile  with  the Wing  CCM,  who  will  coordinate  with  the  MAJCOM/component  functional  manager prior to the members departure for training to ensure the member can complete all aspects of the course.  The FSA Commandant must pre-approve all potential students possessing profiles  prior  to  their  departure  for  training.    If  it  is  deemed  the  member  cannot  attend training, they will be scheduled in the first class available following the expiration of the profile. 5.3.6.  Disciplinary  actions.  The  FSA  Commandant  will  ensure  all  student  disciplinary actions  are  dealt  with  in  an  appropriate  manner,  and  at  the  commandant’s  discretion,  may release  any  student  who  demonstrates  substandard  conduct.    Students  released  for cause/disciplinary actions may not reapply. 5.4.  Installation  Orientation.  Host  Wing  CCMs  will  ensure  a  local  orientation  checklist  is developed specific to the first sergeant position.  This checklist is in addition to the normal unit or  Wing  in-processing  checklist,  and  is  to  ensure  each  newly  arrived  first  sergeant  becomes quickly familiar with local policies, procedures, and key locations essential to first sergeant duty. (T-3). 5.4.1.  The  checklist  will  include  time  with  the  Wing  and  host  Wing  CCM(s)  as  well  as  a variety  of  support  agencies  across  the  installation.    A  sample  checklist  is  provided  in Attachment 2. 5.4.2.  Local  checklists  will  include  OPR  and  location  or  contact  information  for  each element.  CCMs may add specific items to the checklist to cover installation specific topics not  included in  referenced attachments.  The checklist  will be completed within 30 days of assignment, and maintained by the host CCM with council training documents. 5.5.  Continuous  Development.  With  the  unique  strategic  leadership  position  of  the  first sergeant, the host Wing CCMs will ensure first sergeants are provided training and courses that will  strengthen  their  leadership  and  managerial  skills  through  continuous  development. Continuous  development  is  defined  under  three  areas  to  include  education,  training  and experience.  Furthermore, training is applied to both the council as a whole, and each individual. 5.5.1.  First Sergeant Council Training.  Often there are programs, needs or situations that the council must work on together to support the installation, or equally receive like training.  In these instances, training conducted with the council as a whole may be prudent. 5.5.1.1.  The host Wing CCM will ensure each council conducts 12 hours as a minimum per year for training, and will also ensure a training schedule is developed.  Training for all members of a local council will be tailored to the installation needs, and is intended to enhance  the  mission(s)  and  support  of  the  installation,  the  assigned  members  and  their families,  as  well  as  the  community.    Topics  may  include  emergency  management,  late breaking  programs,  deficiencies  or  other  pertinent  items.    Council  training  time  can  be done  monthly,  quarterly  or  in  one  session,  and  is  intended  to  devote  at  least  an  hour  a month towards first sergeant development. (T-3).   30  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 5.5.1.2.  The  host  Wing  CCM  will  ensure  each  member  receives  the  required  training, that it is documented and maintained by the host Wing CCM’s office.  Development and maintenance  of  the  schedule  and  documentation,  as  well  as  execution  of  the  training schedule  may  be  delegated  to  a  member  of  the  First  Sergeant  Council,  but  will  have oversight  and  responsibility  of  the  host  Wing  CCM.    Tenant  Wing  CCMs  will  be consulted when developing the schedule and topics, and a resource and example list will be maintained by the USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager.  (T-3). 5.5.2.  Individual  development.    Individual  training  will  be  based  on  unit  mission,  unit demographics  or  individual  needs.    These  development  items  are  not  intended  as  a  career path  or  roadmap,  rather  as  opportunities  to  enhance  the  individual’s  ability  to  support  the mission,  Airmen  and  their  families,  or  address  deficiencies  the  individual  may  need  to strengthen. 5.5.2.1.  Training.  Training  is  intended  to  provide  specific  skills  or  explain  policy  to  an individual.    Courses  may  range  from  word  processing  tutorials  to  leadership  and management  courses.    Of  note,  first  sergeants  who  have  civilian  employees  assigned  to their  unit  should  complete  an  Air  Force  Civilian  Supervisor  or  equivalent  course  as outlined by the Civilian Personnel Office for civilian supervisors. (T-3). 5.5.2.2.  Education. All RegAF and AFR first sergeants will complete the human resource management  CCAF  degree  within  18  months  of  entry  in  to  the  SDI.  (T-3).  Additional formal training courses may be necessary for a first sergeant; the commander and CCM should provide guidance on courses needed by an individual.  First sergeants should seek additional PME to include in residence and joint opportunities. 5.5.2.3.  Experience.  First  sergeants  should  be  rotated  on  a  regular  basis  to  provide additional  experience  to  enhance  their  ability  as  a  first  sergeant,  or  as  a  SNCO  back  in their PAFSC.  Host Wing CCMs are responsible for tracking all first sergeants, and will work to move RegAF first sergeants to other units between 18-24 months in a particular unit unless assigned to a specific controlled tour. (T-3).  If the CCM must delay a move beyond  24  months  for  mission  reasons,  they  will  consult  with  the  MAJCOM  First Sergeant  Functional  Manager.  (T-3).    ARC  assignments  and  rotations  are  managed  by policy  from  the  respective  component  first  sergeant  functional  managers  and  through Wing CCMs. 5.5.2.4.  The USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager will maintain a comprehensive list  of  training  and  education  opportunities,  and  will  work  with  each  MAJCOM  or component First Sergeant Functional Manager as well as CCMs to provide a thorough list of these opportunities, and the list will be accessible by all first sergeants and command chiefs.

Initial first sergeant tenures are for a minimum of 3 years, and total time in the 8F000 SDI should not exceed 6 consecutive years for MSgts and 7 consecutive years SMSgts.  First sergeants  will  maintain  qualification  standards  during  their  entire  tenure  as  outlined  in paragraph 3.3 of this instruction. 6.1.2.  RegAF  first  sergeant  special  duty  tenure  is  managed  by  AFPC/DPAA2.    AFR  and ANG tenures are managed by their respective functional managers. 6.1.3.  RegAF. 6.1.3.1.  First sergeants have initial first sergeant special duty tenure of 3 years from their graduation date.   Host/component Wing CCMs  will track tenures for  all first  sergeant’s within  their  responsibility.  (T-3).  For  the  purposes  of  assignment,  AFPC/DPAA2  may extend a first sergeant’s tenure upon coordination with the members PAFSC. 6.1.3.2.  First  sergeants  are  automatically  vectored  back  to  their  PAFSC  at  the  end  of their initial 3 year tenure.  However, 15 months prior to the initial 3 year tenure date, they may request to serve an additional 3 year tenure, or request an extension for a period of 12 or 24 months in the special duty.  They will meet with their CCM NLT the 22 month point  of  their  initial  tour  for  continued  service  options.    Any  request  for  continuation beyond  3  years  must  reach  AFPC/DPAA2  NLT  13  months  prior  to  the  end  of  their tenure; late applications will not be accepted. 6.1.3.2.1.  Return  to  previous  AFSC.    If  the  first  sergeant  does  not  request  a subsequent first sergeant tour, they will be identified by AFPC/DPAA2 NLT the 26th month of the member’s current tenure for return to their PAFSC or a previously held AFSC.  If overseas, members will PCS in their previous AFSC upon DEROS. 6.1.3.2.2.  Needs  of  PAFSC.    If  member  is  requested  by  their  PAFSC  functional manager to return to their previous held AFSC, they will be identified for return at the 36 month point in the 8F000 SDI, unless extended for assignment purposes in which case  they  will  be  identified  for  return  at  the  end  of  the  controlled  assignment.    If overseas, members will PCS in their previous AFSC upon DEROS. 6.1.3.3.  Request for second tenure.  First sergeants who desire to remain a first sergeant for a second consecutive tenure must apply and the application must reach AFPC/DPAA2 NLT  13  months  prior  to  the  end  of  their  tenure  or  at  the  13  month  point  prior  to  their DEROS  if serving in  an overseas location.  Members will use the extension  application maintained  by  AFPC/DPAA2  and  will  coordinate  using  the  same  process  as  the  initial application.  Any level in the routing process may vector the first sergeant back to their PAFSC. 6.1.3.3.1.  Members who came from another SDI directly into the 8F000 SDI will not serve  a  second  consecutive  tenure.    These  members  will  be  vectored  back  by AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   33  AFPC/DPAA2  to  their  PAFSC  or  previously  held  AFSC  at  the  completion  of  their initial tour.  These members may apply for a return to the 8F000 SDI at a later date. 6.1.3.3.2.  Applications  approved  by  the  MAJCOM/DRU  First  Sergeant  Functional Manager will be routed to AFPC/DPAA2 who in turn coordinates continued release from the member’s PAFSC. 6.1.3.3.3.  Members  will  be  identified  for  return  to  their  PAFSC  by  AFPC/DPAA2 upon completion of their second consecutive tenure. 6.1.3.4.  Extension.  First  sergeants  may  request  an  extension  in  the  8F000  special  duty, normally in 12 month increments.  Other timeframes will be considered to meet the needs of the AF, and coordination will be completed similar to second tour requests. 6.1.3.5.  Request to remain in 8F000 SDI beyond 6 years.  Unless a member is extended by  AFPC/DPAA2  for  assignment  purposes  (not  to  exceed  7  years),  members  will  be vectored  back  to  their  PAFSC  or  a  previously  held  AFSC  at  their  6  year  point.  Retraining will be considered when opportunities in a previous AFSC are not available.  All requests for special or extenuating circumstances to remain in the 8F000 SDI beyond 6 consecutive years (or 7 as outlined above) will be considered and require approval by the USAF First  Sergeant Special Duty Manager  after coordination with  the Wing CCM and MAJCOM Functional Manager. 6.1.4.  ANG. 6.1.4.1.  Term limits for full-time ANG personnel assigned as first sergeants are governed by ANGI 36-101, AGR Regulation, ANGI 36-2101, Assignments within the Air National Guard  and  TPR  303,  Federal  Technician  Regulation  and  are  to  be  no  less  than  3  years and no more than 6 years, one time in their career from the date of FSA graduation.  Max time  in  TPR  303  should  indicate  max  6  years  from  Nov  2008  update,  per  J1  guidance from NGB. 6.1.4.2.  ANG  Drill  Status  Guardsmen  selected  to  fill  a  master  sergeant  position  are limited  to  a  term  of  no  less  than  3  years  and  no  more  than  6  years  from  the  date  of graduation from  the FSA.  If later selected to  fill  a  SMSgt  first  sergeant  position, a new term of no more than 4 (with caveat) will be incurred based on the date of assignment to that  position  (not  to  exceed  8  years);  Caveat  total  time  as  a  SMSgt  considered  shall include Exceptional Promotion Program (EPP) SMSgt promotions for members who still serve  in  a  MSgt  position  as  listed  in  para  6.1.4.3,  term  limit  adjustment/over-grades.  Thus if an EPP member as described is  placed into  the SMSgt Wing position, from  the date of assignment the time will only increase from the EPP term to one additional year, if not already at the max time of SMSgt rank, for a total of 4 years as a SMSgt in the SDI. Total time for ANG First Sergeants (DSGs) is not to exceed 8 years in the SDI. Example: If  EPP  promoted  and  member  is  at  15  months  EPP  SMSgt  and  moves  into  E8  Wing position, the new time adjust to max of 4 year total SMSgt begins; so 15 months EPP and 33 months remain in E8 position to maximize 4 years as SMSgt, but total time will not exceed  8  years  in  SDI.    Members  who  remain  through  length  of  EPP  max  term,  then promote can only add an additional 1 year period so as not to exceed 4  years SMSgt in SDI.   34  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 6.1.4.3.  ANG members selected for promotion under the EPP will have their maximum term limit date adjusted to match the EPP over-grade expiration date upon coordination with the ANG First Sergeant functional Manager. Total tenure as an ANG First Sergeant (DSG) still will not go beyond 8 years total SDI time. 6.1.4.4.  ANG  first  sergeant  positions  are  not  authorized  over-grades  except  for  EPP promotions. 6.1.4.5.  ANG Personnel must agree to serve tenure of no less than 36 months from FSA graduation  date.  If  the  member  was  a  prior  first  sergeant,  the  tenure  starts  the  day  of assignment.  At  the  end  of  a  3  year  tour,  the  hiring  authority  and  Wing  command  chief will conduct a review of the first sergeant performance. Additional period beyond 3 years is at the discretion and approval of the hiring authority. A Statement of Understanding is to be signed IAW Ch 4.2.2.2 of this AFI. 6.1.4.6.  ANG  Wing  CCMs  may  utilize  involuntary  demotion  for  members  who  do  not complete the necessary 3 years from FSA graduation IAW  ANGI 36-2502 Promotion of Airmen. 6.1.4.7.  ANG  first  sergeants  will  work  through  their  Wing/State  CCMs  and  the  First Sergeant Functional Manager for a second tour continuance coordination approval. 6.1.4.8.  All  ANG  requests  to  remain  in  the  8F000  beyond  6  consecutive  years  require approval  from  the  ANG  Functional  Manager  &  ANG  CCM.  Term  limits  for  full-time personnel assigned as first sergeants are governed by ANGI 36-2101, Assignments Within the Air National Guard. No Drill Status Guard member will go beyond total consecutive tenure  of  8  years  to  include  EPP  promotions,  hard  position  promotions  (Wing headquarters) or any combination thereof. 6.1.4.9.  ANG  Title  10  First  Sergeants  may  serve  beyond  6  years  total  time  and  hiring authority determines tenure. 6.1.4.10.  ANG  First  Sergeants  applying  for  statutory  tour  positions  and  having  not served minimum of 3 years at initial assignment must gain concurrence with ANGFAM prior to submitting applications for said stat tour vacancies. 6.1.5.  AFR. 6.1.5.1.  First  sergeants  have  initial  first  sergeant  special  duty  tenure  of  3  years  from graduation  from  the  FSA.    Corresponding  Wing  CCMs  will  track  tenures  for  all  first sergeant’s within their responsibility. 6.1.5.2.  First sergeants nearing the completion of their initial 3 year tenure may request to  serve  further  within  the  special  duty.    They  will  meet  with  their  CCM  NLT  the  22 month point of their initial tour for continued service options. 6.1.5.2.1.  Return to previous AFSC as an overage is authorized at the completion of their  first  tour,  but  less  than  84  months  from  the  date  assigned  the  8F000  CAFSC. Retention as an overage (Code 4) will be permitted for up to two years from the date removed from the 8F000 position returning to their originating AFSC. If an extension is  requested  beyond  the  allotted  two  year  point  it  will  fall  under  the  FY  manning policy in effect at the time. AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   35  6.1.5.2.2.

If  member  is  requested  by  their  PAFSC  functional manager to return to their previous held AFSC, they will be identified for return at the 36 month point in the 8F000 SDI. 6.1.5.3.  Additional  periods  beyond  the  mandatory  3  year  commitment,  in  the  special duty, are at the discretion of the CCM with approval from the WG/CC or equivalent. 6.1.5.3.1.  Members who came from another SDI directly into the 8F000 SDI may not serve  a  second  consecutive  tenure  if  the  time  away  from  their  PAFCS  exceeds  84 months. 6.1.5.3.2.  The maximum tenure a first sergeant  may serve within a single unit is 48 months  from  the  date  assigned  to  the  first  sergeant  position  on  the  unit  manning document. 6.1.5.3.3.  Participation  within  the  special  duty  past  the  84th  month,  from  the  date assigned DAFSC 8F000, must be at the recommendation of the CCM, for the purpose of development, and approved by the AFR Functional Manager. 6.1.5.4.  For the purpose of professional development, first sergeants retained, after their initial 3 year commitment, must be rotated prior to their 48th month. If an over-grade is requested  during  rotation,  it  will  fall  under  the FY  manning  policy  in  effect  at  the  time with a recommendation by the CCM, approval authority, WG/CC or equivalent. 6.1.6.  The USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager, FSA Commandant, FSA instructors, MAJCOM  First  Sergeant  Functional  Managers,  the  Air  National  Guard  First  Sergeant Functional Manager, the Air Force Reserves Command First Sergeant Functional Manager as well as CMSgt first sergeants filling valid CMSgt 8F000 positions may serve beyond 6 years; the hiring authority determines the tenure. 6.2.  Release from 8F000 SDI. 6.2.1.  Members will automatically be released from the first sergeant special duty at the end of their current tenure, unless a subsequent tenure or extension is approved.  ARC members require coordination approval with hiring authority and AFR or ANG Functional Manager. 6.2.2.  Early  release  (30  days  or  more)  for  RegAF  members  from  the  first  sergeant  special duty  requires  approval  from  the  USAF  First  Sergeant  Special  Duty  Manager  upon recommendation from unit leadership and the MAJCOM First Sergeant Functional Manager.  The  ANG  and  AFR  Functional  Managers  serve  as  the  final  authority  for  release  for  their respective  components.    Note:  Early  release  (before  PECD)  will  not  be  granted  for  the purpose of promotion testing in the members PAFSC. 6.2.3.  Upon release, the member will return to their PAFSC, a previously held AFSC, retrain or (if eligible) retire or separate. 6.3.  Return  to  8F000  SDI.  Former  first  sergeants  who  possess  the  8F000  AFSC  and  have performed  duty  within  the  past  8  years  in  the  SDI  (not  withdrawn  due  to  substandard  duty performance, unacceptable conduct, behavior or cause) may be reutilized as a first sergeant to fill an  AF  need.    If  it  has  been  longer  than  8  years  since  performing  duty  in  the  SDI,  the  member should no longer carry the 8F000 AFSC. 6.3.1.  RegAF.   36  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 6.3.1.1.  Voluntary  return  to  the  first  sergeant  special  duty.

Disciplinary actions  should  be  taken  IAW  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice,  State  Code  of Military Justice and/or appropriate AF or component instructions.   Withdrawal action is taken following an incident that negatively impacts the individual’s ability to continue as a  first  sergeant,  and  does  not  require  disciplinary  actions  to  be  complete  to  initiate  the withdrawal process. 6.5.  RegAF  Assignment.  MSgt  and  SMSgt  first  sergeant  assignments  are  managed  by  HQ AFPC/DPAA2.  AF/DPE assigns CMSgt first sergeants. 6.5.1.  Initial assignment. First sergeant applicants who are not utilized locally will receive an assignment  based  on  Air  Force  needs;  AFPC/DPAA2  will  manage  the  assignment  process, and  subsequent  class  attendance  IAW  Chapter  5  of  this  instruction.    Applicants  are vulnerable for all locations not identified as needing prior experience to include overseas or remote locations. 6.5.2.  Assignment availability. Once a member graduates from the FSA, AFPC/DPAA2 will assign  all  CONUS  first  sergeants  an  AAC  50  with  an  expiration  date  36  months  following their  FSA  graduation.    Members  in  overseas  locations  will  be  managed  via  their  DEROS.  AFPC/DPAA2 may waive codes to facilitate needs of the Air Force. 6.5.3.  Mandatory movers. First sergeants assigned to certain positions may be designated as mandatory  movers;  this  normally  includes  those  assigned  to  isolated  or  detached  duty locations.    AFPC/DPAA2  will  assign  an  AAC  50  to  each  position  identified  by  the  USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager to ensure these members are identified for assignment to enhance the well being of the mission as well as the individual. 6.5.4.  First sergeants will ordinarily compete for assignments upon approval of their second tour  request.    Their  AAC  50  will  be  changed  by  AFPC/DPAA2  to  AAC  FS  with  a corresponding  expiration  date  (normally  a  date  6  years  after  graduation  from  the  FSA, typically  adding  3  years  to  the  overall  tenure)  upon  approval  of  a  second  tour.    They  may compete for assignments any time after being placed on AAC FS as long as they meet PCS eligibility requirements and can obtain the required retainability for the PCS.  AFPC/DPAA2 will  coordinate/seek  early  second  tour  approval  for  those  selected  for  assignments  prior  to reaching the second tour application window. 6.5.5.  Overseas assignments. First sergeants serving an initial tour in overseas locations for a period of two years or less will automatically be considered for a follow-on assignment as a first sergeant for a period of at least two years CONUS, and will receive an AAC 50 expiring 24 months after arrival at the CONUS location.  The member may request another overseas location  for  the  full  prescribed  tour  as  an  8F000  if  released  by  their  PAFSC.    Members selected for an overseas assignment as a first sergeant will serve the entire tour, regardless of tour length, as an 8F000. 6.5.6.  CMSgt or CMSgt select first sergeants serving in a surplus status will be identified by AF/DPE for return to the member’s PAFSC, a previously held AFSC or for any cross-flow opportunities.    Instances  where  8F000  manning  is  over  100%  and  the  member’s  previous   40  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 AFSC is  below 100%, AF/DPE will ensure surplus members compete for an assignment in their previous AFSC during the next assignment cycle.

Airmen should have a first sergeant they can go to and commanders must have a first sergeant to rely on.  For instances with manning shortfalls, or if the unit is not authorized a diamond wearing  first  sergeant  or is  otherwise  geographically separated, an additional duty first  sergeant  may  be  appointed  by  the  unit  commander.    During  periods  of  absence  of  an assigned first sergeant, another SNCO should be temporarily assigned this role to ensure the needs of the mission, Airmen and their families are met. 7.1.2.  Members assigned additional duty first sergeant responsibilities must be in grades E-7 through  E-9.  (T-3).  E-6s  may  only  be  assigned  first  sergeant  responsibilities  in  those situations  where  there  is  neither  a  first  sergeant  nor  SNCO  able  to  assume  additional  duty first  sergeant  responsibilities.  Additional  duty  first sergeants  will not  list their duty title as ‘First Sergeant’ on the EPR.  7.1.3.  Additional  duty  first  sergeants  will  uphold  the  same  professional  profile  and  criteria required for diamond wearing first sergeants. They will fully participate with installation first sergeants in base functions and attend First Sergeant Council meetings. 7.1.4.  Members serving the role as an additional duty or acting first sergeant for more than 30  accumulated  days  will  attend  a  FSA  Additional  Duty  First  Sergeant  Seminar,  or MAJCOM/Component  First  Sergeant  Functional  Manager  approved  equivalent  as  soon  as practical after being appointed. (T-3). 7.2.  Full Time Additional Duty First Sergeants. 7.2.1.  Full  time  additional  duty  first  sergeants  will  be  appointed  in  writing  by  the  unit commander, in coordination with the host Wing CCM, in instances where the unit does not have a designated first sergeant either at the unit or higher level.  Several factors could cause this  situation  including  a  small  unit  size,  8F000  shortfalls  on  the  installation  or  during deployments. 7.2.1.1.   ANG Additional Duty First Sergeants. 7.2.1.1.1.  Additional duty first sergeants within the ANG are authorized based on the needs  of  the  organization.    They  are  still  authorized  at  ST-JFHQ,  GSU’s  and  CSTs (Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction  Civil  Support  Teams).    Unauthorized  use  of Additional  Duty  First  Sergeants  is  prohibited  in  the  ANG.  The  formal  selection process will mirror that of current policy/practice where a vacancy exists as stated in Chapter 4 of this instruction. 7.2.1.1.2.  ANG  members  assigned  as  additional  duty  first  sergeants  must  be  in  the rank of TSgt through SMSgt and uphold the same criteria as stated in Chapter 3 and 4 of this instruction.   44  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 7.2.1.1.3.  ANG additional duty first sergeants must attend the ANG Additional Duty First  Sergeant  seminar  as soon as practical  after  appointment.  This  seminar will be facilitated and managed by the ANG First Sergeant Functional Manager’s office. 7.2.1.1.4.  Fulltime  personnel,  i.e.  AGRs  are  authorized  to  serve  in  this  capacity  to support the needs of the mission. 7.2.1.1.5.  Additional  duty  first  sergeants  are  part  of  the  support  network  within  the ANG  and  as  such  are  to  be  included  in  all  facets  of  the  Wing’s  First  Sergeant Councils without exception as stated in Chapter 8.2.1 of this instruction. 7.2.1.1.6.  Wing/State CCM, as the local functional managers, will control the amount of personnel in this program, not to exceed the authorized number of valid 8F000 first sergeants,  i.e.  one-to-one  ratio  per  authorized  number  of  first  sergeants  at  that location.  Example:  If seven first  sergeants  then no more than seven additional duty first sergeants. 7.2.1.1.7.  Personnel  serving  in  this  capacity  will  not  be  authorized  to  wear  the diamond  device  or  receive  the  SDAP  pay  as  this  is  a  supporting  role  and  not  an assigned authorized 8F000 position as stated in Chapter 9 of this instruction. 7.2.2.  The  member  will  not  serve  in  this  capacity  for  more  than  12  consecutive  months unless  there  are  no  other  options  or  will  otherwise  result  in  mission  degradation,  and  is approved by the Wing CCM.  Additionally, they will not be awarded the CAFSC of 8F000, may not fill an 8F000 manpower position, are not authorized the diamond device and will not receive  SDAP.  Note:  ANG  members  will  coordinate  length  of  this  support  between Wing/State CCM and component Functional Manager 7.2.3.  Airmen  assigned  the  additional  duty  first  sergeant  role  will  attend  the  applicable component  Additional  Duty  First  Sergeant  Symposium,  preferably  before  assuming  the position. 7.2.4.  In  essence,  this  member  will  serve  the  exact  same  role  as  a  diamond  wearing  first sergeant does for other units, and may serve this capacity in addition to their normal mission requirements.    This  member  must  first  understand  their  role  as  a  first  sergeant,  and  how  it differs from their ordinary operational role.  Additionally, they must understand more will be required  of  their  time,  and  will  be  required  to  serve  this  capacity  24  hours  a  day/7  days  a week. 7.2.5.  The host Wing CCM will assign a diamond wearing first sergeant as a mentor.  The additional duty first sergeant must integrate with the local First Sergeant Council as well to ensure they have a diamond wearing first sergeant they can reach at all times. 7.3.  Acting First Sergeants. 7.3.1.  Acting  First  Sergeant  serve  as  his/her  organizations  first  sergeant  solely  during  the temporary absence of the first sergeant (i.e., leave, TDY, hospitalization, etc). 7.3.2.  Airmen  serving  the  capacity  of  the  acting  first  sergeant  must  understand  the  role similarly described in paragraph 7.2.  The individual identified to fill in temporarily must be readily available to respond at any hour, and be trained or given a thorough orientation by the first sergeant. AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   45  7.3.3.  The  assigned  first  sergeant  will  provide  a  thorough  and  portable  continuity  guide  to the acting first sergeant, and ensure they identify members of the First Sergeant Council the acting first sergeant can call for advice. (T-3).   46  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 8 FIRST SERGEANT COUNCILS 8.1.  Philosophy.  A  strong  and  successful  council  contributes  greatly  to  the  success  of  the mission and the health and welfare of Airmen and their families. The council will work with host and tenant CCMs to ensure they meet the needs of the base community and all assigned Airmen. The  first  sergeant  is  an  essential  link  between  the  Airmen  and  base  leadership;  therefore, membership to the council and meeting attendance is mandatory for all assigned first sergeants. 8.2.  Structure. 8.2.1.  Composition.  On  active  duty  installations  where  multiple  Wings  or  tenants  are present, the host Wing CCM will ensure one council is established for the installation and all diamond  wearing  and  additional  duty  first  sergeants  are  active  members.    ARC  Wings  on either  a  stand  alone  installation  or  as  a  tenant  will  establish  a  council  for  their  respective component in a similar fashion.  Bases with multiple components will hold joint meetings at least quarterly but are encouraged to meet more when possible. (T-3). 8.2.2.  Council  leadership.  The  council  is  the  responsibility  of  the  host  Wing  CCM,  but  is generally peer led.  Specific positions of responsibility should be established; the chair of the council will be responsible for meeting agenda and scheduling, and will work with all CCMs on  the  installation  to  ensure  an  effective  council.    Meeting  minutes  will  be  recorded,  and must be maintained IAW AFI 33-322.  The host Wing CCM will ensure leadership positions are  filled  appropriately,  typically  through  nomination  and  voting  by  the  members  of  the council.  Members will serve no more than 12 months in their respective position. 8.2.3.  Additional positions of responsibility.  The CCM may establish additional positions of responsibility to meet the needs of the mission or efforts of the installation.  These positions should be kept as a minimum, but may include representation to other organizations such as the Community Action Information Board, Integrated Delivery System or First Term Airman Center, or may be to fill a specific function or role assigned to the council. 8.2.4.  Additional guests.  The council should invite key leaders from across the installation on a regular basis to both ensure the needs of these organizations are addressed with respect to the duties and responsibilities of a first sergeant, and in turn, ensure these agencies receive feedback  from  first sergeants  concerning their policies, processes and service.   The  council chair  should  strive  to  include  a  single  guest  speaker  at  every  meeting,  but  must  exercise flexibility  for  urgent  matters.    A  variety  of  agencies  should  be  considered  to  include  those dealing  with  personnel,  medical,  legal,  services  and  facilities  among  others  pertinent  to  the missions  of  the  installation.    Certain  agencies  may  regularly  attend  council  meetings,  but CCMs  and  council  leadership  should  ensure  their  participation  is  both  necessary  and complimentary to the efforts of the First Sergeant Council; potential regular attendees include a representative from AFOSI, the Chaplain or the CAA. 8.2.5.  Meeting location. The host Wing CCM will ensure the meetings are held in a private meeting  location  that  is  easily  accessible  by  all  attendees  allowing  adequate  time  for extended discussions. AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   47  8.2.6.  Frequency.  As  a  minimum,  RegAF  First  Sergeant  Councils  will  meet  weekly,  and ARC First Sergeant Councils will meet monthly.  Every attempt should be made to schedule the meetings to accommodate all attendees. (T-3). 8.2.7.  Meeting  with  Wing  leadership.    All  installation  CCMs  will  attend  their  respective component  First  Sergeant  Council  meetings.    (T-3).  At  a  minimum,  RegAF  councils  will meet with their host Wing or vice Wing commander on a quarterly basis to ensure the council has a direct dialogue with top leadership to discuss mission and installation related concerns.  (T-3).  ARC  councils  will  meet  with  their  respective  Wing  leadership  in  similar  fashion.  Additionally,  tenant  Wing  leaders  should  be  included  on  a  rotational  basis,  either  in conjunction with the host Wing, or on a separate basis. 8.2.8.  Training.  Councils  will conduct a minimum of 12 hours of continuous development training  annually  to  include  subjects  pertinent  to  the  installation.    Host  Wing  CCMs  are charged with ensuring an annual training plan is developed, executed, and documented IAW Chapter  5  of  this  instruction.  (T-3)  Note:  ARC  CCMs  should  budget  for  additional  time annually concerning training for their councils, outside the scheduled UTA and annual tour, for developmental/recurrent training.. 8.3.  Private Organizations (POs).  First Sergeant Councils are not private organizations, but as a complimentary organization, the non-profit charter associated with a First Sergeant Council is often an important aspect of what first sergeants do to support the installation. 8.3.1.  Establishing a non-profit organization.  If members of a First Sergeant Council wish to charter a non-profit organization, they must adhere to AFI 34-223.  These chartered private organizations  (associated  with  the  First  Sergeant  Council)  are  defined  as  self-sustaining special interest groups, set up by people acting exclusively outside the scope of any official capacity  as  officers,  employees  or  agents  of  the  Federal  Government.  They  operate  on  Air Force installations with the written consent of the installation commander.  8.3.2.  Membership will not be required of the non-profit organization, although the member is required to be part of the First Sergeant Council.  Personal and professional participation in POs is governed by DOD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation for every member who chooses to participate.   48  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 THE FIRST SERGEANT DEVICE & SPECIAL DUTY ASSIGNMENT PAY Chapter 9 9.1.  First Sergeant Device. 9.1.1.  First Sergeants. 9.1.1.1.  Wear  of  the  first  sergeant  device  (diamond)  is  authorized  when  the  member  is awarded  the  8F000  CAFSC,  is  assigned  to  a  valid  8F000  DAFSC  position  and  has completed  the  FSA.  Note:  Member  may  not  wear  the  device  when  double  billeted  for more than 120 days (60 days at the losing base and 60 days at the gaining base). 9.1.1.2.  Graduates  returning  to  the  losing  base  and  serving  in  their  primary  AFSC awaiting  PCS  do  not  fill  a  valid  8F000  position  and  will  not  wear  the  diamond.    With commander  approval,  CCMs  may  utilize  these  individuals  to  fill  8F000  DAFSC vacancies until PCS and they may wear the diamond. 9.1.1.3.  Graduates who return to the losing installation only to out process may wear the diamond. 9.1.1.4.  The  diamond  will  be  worn  according  to  AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal Appearance of Air Force Personnel while serving as a first sergeant in the 8F000 SDI. 9.1.1.5.  Members deployed to serve in non-8F000 positions will not wear the diamond. 9.1.1.6.  ANG  members  who  are  serving  a  dual  role  capacity  (technician  or  AGR)  will not wear the diamond during times when they are not serving in the official capacity as a first sergeant. 9.1.2.  The USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager, FSA Commandant, FSA instructors, MAJCOM Functional Managers, ANG and AFR First Sergeant Functional Managers, as well as the AFPC 8F000 Assignment FAM will wear the first sergeant device. 9.1.3.  Additional  Duty  First  Sergeants.    Members  assigned  as  additional  duty,  acting  or assistant first sergeants will not wear the diamond. 9.1.4.  Retired  First  Sergeants.    Retired  members,  whose  terminal  assignment  was  as  a  first sergeant,  may  wear  the  diamond  device  in  all  instances  where  the  wear  of  the  uniform  is appropriate,  according  to  AFI  36-2903,  Dress  and  Personal  Appearance  of  Air  Force Personnel.  Requests for exceptions to policy for former first sergeants who retire at the same rank they served as a first sergeant, and the entire tenure was honorable, may be considered by the USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager. 9.2.  Special Duty Assignment Pay (SDAP).  To receive SDAP, first sergeants must meet all of the  following  criteria  governed  by  AFI  36-3017,  Table  1.    Individuals  serving  in  an  additional duty, acting or assistant capacity are ineligible for this pay. 9.2.1.  Hold the rank of MSgt or higher. 9.2.2.  Graduated the FSA and be awarded the CAFSC of 8F000. AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   49  9.2.3.  Must be serving in an authorized 8F000 DAFSC First Sergeant billet.  Note: Per AFI 36-3017, Table 1, member may not be double billeted for more than 60 days (30 days at the losing base and 30 days at the gaining base).   50  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 Chapter 10 MANPOWER & UTILIZATION OF FIRST SERGEANTS 10.1.  Manpower.  First  sergeants  traditionally  serve  in  one-deep  positions  across  a  variety  of units whose missions are diverse and most likely  not aligned  with  previous experience.  These positions rarely if ever require a technical background aligned with the unit’s mission, allowing outside perspective. Air  Force units vary  greatly  in  size, and the manpower standard takes into consideration  a  majority  of  these  units.    In  some  instances  units  will  be  too  large  for  one  first sergeant; therefore, multiple 8F000 positions may be authorized to one unit, typically a squadron.  Occasionally,  units  will  not  earn  a  first  sergeant  authorization  but  may  need  one  based  on  a unique situation.  On other occasions, some units will earn a first sergeant authorization but may not  need  one  based  on  a  unique  situation.      The  Air  Force  Manpower  Standard  (AFMS) quantifies the manpower required to accomplish the tasks described in this AFI for varying levels of  workload  for  RegAF.  AFR  and  ANG  quantify  their  component  manpower  required  to accomplish the tasks described in this AFI for varying levels of workload. 10.1.1.  First  sergeants  normally  serve  in  units  not  aligned  with  their  technical  background.  CCMs should take great care to ensure the right first sergeant is matched with each unit and mission while ensuring a diverse distribution of first sergeants across the installation.  RegAF and AFR first sergeants should not be immediately reassigned back to the unit they served in another AFSC as their first assignment out of the FSA. increased 10.1.2.  RegAF  and  AFR  CMSgt  positions  will  be  directed  by  policy  for  key  positions requiring  an first  sergeant  positions  are  authorized  at MAJCOM/COCOM,  designated  8F000  Functional  Managers,  FSA  Commandant  position, and  the  USAF  First  Sergeant  Special  Duty  Manager  only.  ANG  CMSgt  First  Sergeant positions beyond the ANG Functional Manager are not authorized. rank.  CMSgt 10.1.3.  RegAF SMSgt positions not earned in the AFMS. 10.1.3.1.  MAJCOM/DRU/component  functional  managers  (AFDW  for  AF  Elements) will coordinate to identify one SMSgt position at each AF installation.  The SMSgt billet should  be  assigned  to  the  largest  unit  on  the  installation,  regardless  of  MAJCOM/DRU affiliation.  The SMSgt assigned to the position assists the host CCM with first sergeant functional  management  and  serves  as  a  mentor  to  all  first  sergeants  assigned  to  the  AF installation. 10.1.3.2.  MAJCOM/DRU/component functional manager (AFDW for AF Elements) will identify  any  additional  positions  to  be  designated  as  SMSgt  positions  based  on  unique needs  or  demographics,  and  will  work  with  their  corresponding  manpower  offices  to justify  these  positions.    Examples  include  positions  at  NAF  or  equivalent  levels,  joint billets, units serving on a different services installation (not joint bases), and those with increased  roles/responsibilities  as  outlined  in  the  duty  description.    Copies  of  all variations will be forwarded to the USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager. 10.1.4.  Basic  Military  Training  units  working  directly  with  trainees  are  authorized  an  8F000 position in the rank of SMSgt.  Any additional positions will be based on unique needs or demographics, and will be worked by each MAJCOM/DRU/component functional AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014   51  manager with their corresponding manpower offices to justify these positions.  Copies of all variations will be forwarded to the USAF First Sergeant Special Duty Manager. 10.1.5.  Manning.  Although  an  authorization  exists,  MAJCOMs  are  required  to  fund  the positions  for  units  within  their  command.    Each  MAJCOM  should  carefully  review  the requirements of each unit with respect to their first sergeant needs, and ensure a first sergeant is  available  as  appropriate.    NGB/A1M  will  flow  their  members  UMDs  to  FSS  Personnel Chiefs.  ANG  CCMs  should  review  UMDs  periodically  to  ensure  proper  force  management of their respective council. 10.1.6.  First  sergeants  normally  serve  in  units  not  aligned  with  their  technical  background.  CCMs should take great care to ensure the right first sergeant is matched with each unit and mission while ensuring a diverse distribution of first sergeants across the installation.  RegAF and  AFR  first  sergeants  will  not  be  immediately  reassigned  back  to  the  unit  they  served  in another  AFSC  as  their  first  assignment  out  of  the  FSA.  Note:  ANG  DSG  members  go through  selection  process  for  SDI  duty  and  may  be  hired  into  the  unit  they  have  served another PAFSC in.  Proper force management must be utilized and provide a path back into the  operational  environment  of  affected  ANG  units.    Leadership  of  gaining/losing  units  of affected members should take advantage of operational placement for these key individuals and their gained professional experience from the career broadening SDI tour.  10.2.  Organization of Assignment.  Every Airman should have an assigned first sergeant they can rely on with clearly defined areas of responsibility. 10.2.1.  Squadron  First  Sergeant.    First  sergeants  are  ordinarily  assigned  at  the  squadron level.  Based on manning, mission or unique circumstances, first sergeants may be assigned at other levels based on mission requirements. 10.2.2.  Group  First  Sergeant.  When  assigned  to  a  Group,  the  first  sergeant  must  work diligently to serve all commanders and Airmen across the entire Group, and only experienced first  sergeants  should  be  considered  for  these  roles.    The  first  sergeant  will  be  rated  by  the Group  commander,  but  must  build  a  relationship  of  trust  with  each  of  the  squadron commander’s the first sergeant advises.  Furthermore, it is imperative the first sergeant works to engage Airmen across the diverse spectrum they serve. 10.2.3.  Multiple  first  sergeants  in  a  unit.    Units  with  large  numbers  of  assigned  personnel may  be  granted  more  than  one  first  sergeant  authorization  IAW  the  AFMS.    In  these instances, the commander must define each first  sergeant’s area of responsibility within the unit.    Specifically,  each  first  sergeant  should  have  a  clear  definition  of  the  personnel  or flights/sections/areas  they  serve,  and  each  first  sergeant  will  have  the  same  roles  and responsibilities with respect to these defined audiences.  Each first sergeant will be rated by the squadron commander. (T-3). 10.2.4.  First sergeants for multiple squadrons.  Instances where a squadron does not have a first sergeant assigned, or does not have a first sergeant authorization, the CCM may assign first  sergeant  duties  to  another  squadron  level  first  sergeant  after  coordination  with  both squadron commanders.  When this occurs, the first sergeant, who is still assigned to another squadron,  must  engage  the  other  squadron  much  like  a  Group  or  Wing  level  first  sergeant would.  However, the first sergeant will be rated by the assigned squadron commander, and will not assume a different duty title.   52  AFI36-2113  18 NOVEMBER 2014 10.2.5.  Advisory  roles.    CCMs  may  assign  first  sergeants  as  advisors  to  additional  duty  or temporary  first  sergeants of  another unit after  coordination  with  both  unit  commanders.   In these  instances,  the  first  sergeant  will  support,  advise  and  mentor  the  additional  duty  or temporary  first  sergeant  and  may  be  called  upon  by  the  other  unit  commander  for  advice.  First sergeants must be careful not to undermine the actions or efforts of the additional duty or temporary first sergeant. 10.2.6.  Other type organizations.  There will be instances where a first sergeant is needed in a  unit  type  not  listed  above.    In  these  instances,  the  MAJCOM/DRU/component  First Sergeant  Functional  Manager  will  be  consulted  by  the  Wing  and/or  state  CCM.    The MAJCOM/DRU/component First Sergeant Functional Manager will ensure the position and unit of assignment is valid and meets the needs of the mission. 10.3.  Duties.  First  sergeants  have  broad  responsibility  to  include  a  great  many  programs,  but are primarily focused on how to support the mission of the unit through support of the Airmen and their families.  The first sergeant duties and responsibilities are outlined in Chapter 2 of this instruction, and commanders must take great care to not assign duties other than those contained in this AFI, the specialty description in AFECD or according to the Process Oriented Description as  outlined  in  the  manpower  standard  unless  absolutely  critical  to  the  mission  of  the  unit.
