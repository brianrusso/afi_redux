Adjacent to the area of interest is a metal manufacturing plant, slightly uphill and upwind of proposed sleeping area. Heavy metals specifically chromium are expected to be present in the rocky soil area as indicated by wet ground leading from the plant. In addition wet soil was noticed near one sleeping tent.  So as part of the OEHSA/CSM, the trainee is expected to develop a soil sampling strategy based on the above intelligence data. Conduct hands-on training and evaluation. Given activity assessment data, listed reference(s) and location documentation, determine/establish a soil/solid sampling strategy, successfully completing all checklist items with limited assistance on only the hardest parts.  This TRAINING MODULE is designed to work in conjunction with TRAINING MODULES 4.5.3.3 Collect soil/solid samples and 4.5.3.5 Field analyze soil/solid samples and serves to create a comprehensive 3-step plan of instruction that comprehensively assesses the student’s ability to: • • •   develop soil/solid sampling methodologies, conduct analysis  select and utilize equipment for collecting samples and field analysis.    1 AFQTP 4B051-8                                                             Journeyman Training Guide:  Soil/ Solid Sampling Strategy   TASK STEPS   1.  Determine sampling location(s). 1.1. Identify source analysis indicating area of contamination and contaminants1. 1.2. Conduct interviews of personnel in or around area. 1.3. Consider areas further away from the site of actual or suspected contamination to determine the extent of the contamination.  1.4. Consider appropriateness and location(s) of Control Samples.  2.  Determine Soil Type(s) 2. 3.  Determine sampling method(s).  3.1. Statistical Sampling3. 3.2. Non-statistical Sampling4. 4.  Determine sampling types(s) 5. 5.  Determine sampling depth6. 6.  Determine type of sampling equipment, devices and supplies required7.  7.  Document findings8.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:  NOTES:  1.  Methods of identification include locating leaking containers or pipes, areas of wet, oily or discolored soil, dead vegetation, and/or an unpleasant odor.  Use of direct reading equipment (DRI) sampling equipment may be considered in order to get an idea of what type of CBRN material might have contaminated the soil.   2.  Soil Types; •  Sand •  Silt •  Clay  3.  Statistical Sampling: •  Simple random sampling •  Stratified random sampling •  Systematic grid sampling •  Hot spot sampling  4.  Non-statistical Sampling: •  Biased Sampling • Judgemental Sampling  5.  Determine sampling types(s): •  Homogenized •  Composite •  Sieving  2 AFQTP 4B051-8                                                             Journeyman Training Guide:  Soil/ Solid Sampling Strategy  •  Volatile organic compounds sampling •  Clay  6.  Determine sampling depth: •  Surface sampling •  Subsurface sampling  7.  Selection of specific sampling devices to be used, equipment required and supplies to be used should be based on previous task steps. Samples should reflect the concentration of contaminants at the site and can be used to make decisions and conclusions about the entire site.   8.  Proper documentation is a critical step in a sampling methodology. Details that should be documented include:  • • • • • • • • • • site location,  date/time of contaminant release,  date/time samples were collected,  sample number,  collector’s name,  description of the samples, possible sources of contamination release,   any identifying marks on containers and drums in the area,  local weather at the sampling site, and  results of any on-site monitoring.    3    AFQTP 4B051-8                                                             Journeyman Training Guide:  Soil/ Solid Sampling Strategy  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS      STS Line Item 4.5.3.2:  Determine or establish soil/solid sampling strategies 1.

Based on the example scenario, what would be the best soil sampling approach and what would be your recommendations to the commander?  A: Statistical Sampling: Hot spot sampling.   A complete pathway was identified linking chromium in a single hot spot of contaminated soil at the entrance of one isolated sleeping tent in Ubetchastan. Sampling has determined that the concentration of chromium is slightly below applicable environmental standards. Control options provided to the commander are: •  Remove contaminated soil ASAP •  Remove personnel from tent near contamination and distribute them among other tents •  Provide containment for contaminated soil and remove before rainy season •  Relocate the tent since the source may be transported to the site via flood water  (Source: BE Field Manual Nov 2012)     8 AFQTP 4B051-8                                                             Journeyman Training Guide:  Soil/ Solid Sampling Strategy   STS Line Item 4.5.3.3(a):  Collect soil / solid samples (Auger)    Proficiency Code: PC Definition: Prerequisites: Training References: Additional Supporting References: CDC Reference: Training Support Material: Specific Techniques: Criterion Objective: Notes: TRAINER GUIDANCE 2b Can do most parts of the task.

The Veihmeyer is a good core sampler for most types of soil and can reach depths of up to 10 feet. It is the best sampler for undisturbed soil samples taken at depths greater than 1 foot. Its major limitation is that it cannot penetrate stony or rocky soil.

Along with providing real-time on-scene results, what is the biggest advantage of the HAPSITE chemical identification system?

List three possible scenarios for using the HAZMAT ID:  A:  The HAZMATID™ instantly compares a sample’s infrared fingerprint against onboard databases to provide the identity of the unknown. Therefore, it can be used in the following scenarios:  •  ID of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) (e.g., nerve and blister agents •  ID of toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) •  ID of forensic drugs and Clan Lab precursors •  ID of white powders •  ID of explosives •  ID of WMD precursors •  ID Common chemicals  (Source: Career Development Course 4B051)   8.  List the main limitation or weakness of the HAZMAT ID:  A:  The major weakness of the HAZMATID™ is that it can only identify, not quantify; thus, it cannot be used in health risk assessments (in most cases).
