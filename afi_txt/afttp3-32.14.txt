Overview.  This  publication  provides  an  alternate  sequence  to  install Emergency  Airfield  Lighting  System  (EALS)  components  when  necessary  to meet the Air Component Commander’s Air Tasking Order (ATO) after a major enemy attack. However, it does not replace component installation instructions found  in  Technical  Order  (T.O.)  35F5-3-17-1,  Emergency  Airfield  Lighting System.  Specifically,  it  describes  required  resources,  planning  factors,  and  an alternate installation sequence of contingency airfield lighting systems. 1.2. Variation of Procedures. It is unlikely the contingency lighting system can be installed  without disruptions after a  major attack. Legacy procedures direct MOS  marking  precede  lighting  installation,  and  then  lighting  installed  in  a specific sequence while pavement repairs are in progress. Final connections and system  checkout  finishes  after  pavement  repairs  are  complete.  However,  the time allotted to repair the amount of expected damage and numbers of recovery equipment, personnel, and vehicles throughout the minimum airfield operating surface (MAOS) during the recovery process will likely dictate changes to the lighting installation sequence from those described in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1.  1.2.1.  Legacy  marking  procedures  used  “T”  clear  zones  to  mark  crater  repair areas  that  should  not  be  entered  by  support  teams  until  the  crater  has  been repaired. With today’s threat it is unlikely “T” clear zones will be used to mark repair  areas;  doing  so  would  likely  produce  “T”  clear  zones  throughout  the entire  MOS  leaving  little  to  no  real  estate  for  support  teams  (i.e.,  Aircraft Arresting System [AAS] Installation Team, MAOS Marking Team, Contingency Airfield  Lighting Installation Team, and Water and Fuel Expeditionary  Repair System [WaFERS] Team) to begin their recovery efforts.  1.2.2. Contingency lighting installation will most likely begin with tasks on the MAOS periphery after a major attack. As pavement repairs are completed and relieve congestion on parts of the MAOS, teams may begin installing MOS edge lighting and finish just before pavement repair final curing. Follow T.O. 35F5-3-17-1 instructions and task sequencing to the greatest extent possible; however, when  contingency  lighting  installation  processes  conflict  with  other  recovery operations, perform installation as described in Chapter 4 of this publication to expedite the process.  4 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 1.3.  Description.  The  current  Base  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources  (BEAR) contingency airfield lighting system is the EALS. The EALS is designed to be rapidly  installed  at  contingency  airfields  or  at  other  locations  that  need temporary  airfield  lighting.  When  installed,  it  provides  runway  edge  lighting, approach  lighting,  threshold/end  lighting,  taxiway  lighting,  visual  glide  slope indication,  runway  distance  marker  (RDM)  lighting,  and  obstruction  lighting. The system is suitable for Visual Flight Rules during contingency operations at night and during periods of reduced visibility but do not qualify the airfield for instrument operations of any kind. The standards in this publication do not apply to  forward  tactical  airfields  or  landing  zones  requirements.  See  AFI  13-217, Assault Zone Procedures, for guidance on those requirements. Note: RDMs are described as distance-to-go (DTG) markers in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1;  however,  they  will  be  referred  to  as  RDM  within  this  publication  to  be consistent with other DOD publications. 1.3.1. The EALS can be installed and secured on all types of surfaces (e.g., sand, frozen earth, mud, ice, asphalt, and concrete). The EALS can light a Minimum Operating  Strip  (MOS)  up  to  150  ft.  by  10,000  ft.  Installation  of  a  50  ft.  by 5,000 ft. MOS can be accomplished within 2.5 hours by a six person crew using two general purpose vehicles (e.g., 0.75 ton pick-up, 1 ton, 1.5 ton trucks, etc.) under  ideal  conditions.  The  EALS  can  be  installed  by  personnel  wearing chemical defense gear and/or arctic weather clothing, including arctic mittens.  1.3.2. The EALS also contains taxiway lighting and reflectors, approach lighting equipment,  RDM  lights,  obstruction  lights,  and  Precision  Approach  Path Indicators (PAPIs). 1.3.3.  The  EALS  is  designed  for  use  as  a  unidirectional  or  bidirectional contingency  lighting  system.  It  is  not  designed  for  permanent  use,  to  support instrument flight rules (IFR) operations, or use when meteorological visibility is less than four statute miles. 1.4.  Safety  Summary.  The  following  paragraphs  describe  general  safety precautions  not related to any specific procedures and therefore do not appear elsewhere  in  this  publication.  These  are  recommended  precautions  personnel should understand and apply during all phases of operation and maintenance.  1.4.1. Keep Away From Live Circuits. Personnel should at all times observe all  safety  regulations.  Do  not  replace  components  or  make  adjustments  inside equipment  with  the  voltage  supply  energized.  Under  certain  conditions, 5 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 dangerous potentials may exist when the system is de-energized due to charges retained by capacitors. To avoid casualties, always remove power and ground a circuit before touching it. Adhere to all lockout/tag-out requirements.  1.4.2.  Do  Not  Service  or  Adjust  Alone.  Under  no  circumstances  should  any person reach into or enter energized enclosures for the purpose of servicing or adjusting equipment except in justified circumstances and approved by the Base Civil  Engineer,  or  equivalent,  and  in  the  presence  of  someone  capable  of rendering aid IAW AFI 32-1064, Electrical Safe Practices.  1.4.3.  Do  Not  Drive  over  Exposed  Cables.  The  EALS  has  cable  protection strips which protect runway cable at points where it crosses active taxiways or at other points where runway cable crossing by planes or vehicles is required. Only drive  over  these  protection  strips.  Driving  over  live/active  power  cables  is  an unsafe practice. Loose cables could create a spark resulting in fire, and/or injury to ground support personnel. 1.4.4.  Resuscitation.  Personnel  working  on  or  near  high  voltages  should  be trained in modern methods of resuscitation.   6 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Chapter 2 RESOURCES  2.1. EALS Equipment. The EALS is packed on six trailers (Figure 2.1) that fit within three 463L aluminum aircraft pallet positions. The equipment needed to install a 50 ft. by 5,000 ft. MOS is packed on four trailers (trailers #2, 3, 4, and 5)  which  fit  on  two  pallet  positions.  Table  2.1  lists  the  stored  location  of equipment/components.

Before beginning the EALS installation, the team will  receive  information  on  the  MOS  location,  taxiway  locations,  direction  of aircraft  takeoffs  and  landings,  approach  slope/PAPI  aiming  angle,  arresting system location, and lighting subsystems to be installed from the Support Chief (see AFPAM 10-219V4 for airfield recovery command and control hierarchy). Table  A2.1  in  Attachment  2  lists  the  required  information  needed  before  the installation begins. 3.2.  Pre-Employment  Checks.  Observe  safety  precautions  in  Table  A2.2 before  inspecting  and/or  servicing  equipment.  Perform  equipment  checks outlined in Table A2.3 before operating the system to ensure equipment is ready for installation and operation. 3.3. Pre-Marking of Light Locations. Typically, a marking crew will mark the location of the runway, taxiways, approach lights, strobes, PAPI, RDMs, and the aircraft  arresting  systems  prior  to  the  EALS  installation.  Verify  marked locations are in compliance with criteria in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1. See UFC 3-535-01,  Visual  Air  Navigation  Facilities,  to  determine  proper  PAPI  system  siting requirements. 3.3.1.  The  PAPI  system  should  be  securely  installed  on  stabilized  surfaces  to keep proper alignment and angle  setting. If soil is  used to elevate PAPI units, soil  should  be  placed  within  a  form  and  compacted  to  prevent  soil  from shifting/settling due to environmental conditions (e.g., wind and rain), jet blasts, engine vibrations, etc. Forms should be left in place after installation to maintain compaction.  3.3.2. If time permits, a concrete foundation may be poured with rapid-setting crater  repair  material  for  mounting  PAPI  units  using  concrete  anchors  if available.  3.3.3.  Additionally,  a  wooden  mounting  deck  may  be  constructed  during  pre-attack actions. The deck legs should be long enough so when the PAPI unit is at the  proper  elevation  the  top  of  the  unit  is  not  more  than  6  feet  above  ground level and the legs are buried at least one foot for stability. If the proper mounting height  is  below  the  six  foot  maximum  the  legs  may  be  cut,  but  keep  the  legs 10 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 long enough so they may be buried at least one foot while still maintaining the proper PAPI unit height. 3.4. Tape Sweep Area. Minimum tape sweep area is determined by sighting a straight line from the position of the runway edge sheave to a point of maximum tape  payout  (990-  or  1200-ft)  down  the  centerline  in  direction  of  arrestment. Remove lights and cable  within this area on both sides of the runway. Repeat process in opposite direction for a bidirectional installation. Table A2.4 shows approximate  light  free  zone  distances  for  a  990-ft  tape  payout,  with  90/153-ft pendants, and edge lights offset at 0, 5, and 10 ft.    11 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Chapter 4 INSTALLATION SEQUENCE  4.1.  Introduction.  This  chapter  provides  an  alternate  EALS  layout  and installation sequence after a major attack as a result of extensive damage from the  attack  and  may  vary  from  sequences  found  in  T.O.  35F5-3-17-1.  The sequences  provided  in  this  chapter  are  recommended  to  reduce  layout  and installation  time  to  the  greatest  extent  possible.  The  EALS  Team  Lead determines if the ground truth dictates varying from T.O. sequencing. 4.2.  Modified  EALS  Layout  and  Installation  Sequence.  The  following paragraphs show the preferred routes by the four EALS installation teams when the airfield is  saturated by bomb damage, repair crews, and their vehicles and equipment.  They  also  outline  the  corresponding  sequence  of  tasks  performed when unable to follow the T.O. sequence.  4.2.1. Team-A Installation  Sequence. Figure A3.1 illustrates the route taken and  outlines  the  basic  tasks  performed  by  Team-A  during  EALS  installation. Ensure  UXO  are  cleared  in  work  areas  prior  to  beginning  work.  Team-A installation procedures are as follows: 4.2.1.1. Latch the RAC door open and connect trailer #2 to the  vehicle. Make sure all straps are secured to prevent interference with cable reel operation. 4.2.1.2.  With  TAG-A  aboard,  drive  to  End-A  threshold  and  payout  200-ft runway  cable  segments  from  the  threshold  to  the  strobe  master  unit  location (1,200-ft from threshold). 4.2.1.3.  At  the  strobe  master  unit  location  (center  strobe  location)  begin installing  End-A  strobe  segment  as  described  in  T.O.  35E5-3-17-1,  TEAM  A MOS Installation Procedure paragraph. 4.2.1.4. After strobe segment is installed, drop off TAG-A and three approach lights,  three  45W  isolation  transformers,  three  stakes  or  ballast  rings,  and  two 10-ft  runway  cables  near  the  strobe  slave  unit  nearest  the  threshold  for  the 1,000-ft  crossbar.  This  crossbar  should  be  installed  3  to  5  feet  in  front  of  the strobe slave nearest the threshold. 4.2.1.5.  Place  approach  lights,  45W  isolation  transformers,  stakes  or  ballast rings,  and  200-ft  runway  cable  from  the  strobe  slave  unit  location  nearest  the threshold  to  the  center  of  the  threshold.  Procedures  for  light  fixture  and 12 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 transformer  placement  are  provided  in  T.O.  35F5-3-17-1,  Light  Fixture,  DTG Marker Light, and Transformer Placement paragraph. 4.2.1.6.  At  threshold,  place  and  install  End-A  threshold/end  lights,  100W isolation  transformers,  10-ft  runway  cable  and  two  ballast  rings  per  fixture.  If threshold/end lights are to be installed on soil, place one stake per fixture vice ballast rings. Place 10-ft cable segments so male ends of connectors point in a clockwise direction around the runway. Install fixtures 10-ft from threshold with light  fixture  cord  oriented  away  from  the  MOS  to  prevent  jet  blasts  from launching  transformers  towards  light  fixtures  and  causing  possible  damage. Space  fixtures  10-ft  apart  and  ensure  outside  threshold/end  lights  are  lined  up with edge lights. Cable between light fixture and transformer should be pulled taught  so  jet  blasts  do  not  displace  transformers  and  cause  movement  of  light fixtures.  Place  two  ballast  rings  on  each  threshold/end  light  or  stake  fixtures down if possible. 4.2.1.7. Begin installing End-A approach lights and 45W transformers along the MOS centerline from the center of the threshold towards the strobes. The light fixture  cord  should  be  oriented  perpendicular  to  the  centerline.  Continue installing  approach  lights  until  meeting  TAG-A.  If  TAG-A  has  not  completed assigned tasks on End-A, assist TAG-A until all End-A tasks are complete. 4.2.1.8. Pick up TAG-A and  drive to Edge-A PAPI location, place and install PAPIs using procedures provided in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1, paragraph 3-48. 4.2.1.9. If applicable, drive to Edge-B PAPI location, place and install PAPIs. 4.2.1.10.  Drop  TAG-A  at  End-A  and  proceed  towards  End-B  placing  edge lights,  RDM  lights,  45W  transformers  (for  both  edge  lights  and  RDM  lights), stakes,  and  200-ft  runway  cable  along  Edge-A.  In  areas  that  have  not  been cleared  of  repair  vehicles  and  debris,  place  items  far  enough  from  MOS  edge where they will not be damaged. 4.2.1.11.  When  reaching  End-B,  travel  back  along  Edge-A  from  End-B threshold  toward  End-A  installing  edge  lights  (and  staking),  RDM  lights, transformers previously placed on the ground until meeting up with TAG-A. 4.2.1.12. Pick up TAG-A and drive to regulator/control panel location and check with Team B to see if they need assistance. 4.2.2. TAG-A Installation Sequence. Figure A3.2 displays the route taken and outlines the basic tasks performed by TAG-A during EALS installation. Ensure 13 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 UXO  are  cleared  in  work  areas  prior  to  beginning  work.  TAG-A  installation procedures are as follows: 4.2.2.1. Carry out steps in paragraphs 4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.3 with Team-A. 4.2.2.2. Payout 200-foot runway cable segments form End-A threshold to strobe master unit location. 4.2.2.3. Install End-A strobe segment with Team-A as described in T.O. 35E5-3-17-1, paragraph 3-23.d thru l. 4.2.2.4. Travel on foot to inboard strobe slave and install three End-A crossbar approach  lights  and  45W  transformers.  The  center  crossbar  approach  light should be placed on the approach side of the near strobe slave  unit. The right crossbar approach light should be installed even with the center approach light and  10-ft  to  the  right  of  the  MOS  centerline  (use  10-ft  cable  as  a  measuring device). The left crossbar approach light should be installed even with the center approach light and 10-ft to the left of the MOS centerline. 4.2.2.5. Install End-A approach lights and 45W transformers from the crossbar to  the  center  of  the  End-A  threshold.  The  approach  lights  should  be  installed along  the  centerline  with  the  light  fixture  cord  oriented  perpendicular  to  the centerline. 4.2.2.6.  When  meeting  Team-A  while  installing  End-A  approach  lights,  join Team-A and assist with installing Edge-A PAPIs IAW T.O. 35F5-3-17-1, PAPI Subsystem Installation paragraph. 4.2.2.7. Travel with Team-A to Edge-B PAPIs and assist with PAPI installation. 4.2.2.8. Travel with Team-A to End-A. Dismount and travel on foot installing Edge-A  light  fixtures,  RDM  lights,  and  transformers  toward  End-B.  Stake  the fixtures as needed. At the arresting barrier, ensure the runway cable is clear of the arresting gear and tape sweep area (Team-A will be installing light fixtures and transformers along Edge-A from End-B toward End A simultaneously).  4.2.2.9.  Upon  meeting  Team-A  and  edge  light  installation  is  complete,  join Team-A  and  proceed  to  regulator/control  panel  location  and  assist  Team-B  if necessary. 4.2.3. Team-B Installation Sequence. Figure A3.3 shows the route taken and outlines the basic tasks performed by Team-B during EALS installation. If the MOS is unidirectional, disregard paragraphs 4.2.3.1. thru 4.2.3.14 and 4.2.3.16. 14 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Ensure  UXO  are  cleared  in  work  areas  prior  to  beginning  work.  Team-B installation procedures are as follows: 4.2.3.1. Latch the RAC door open and connect trailer #3 to vehicle. Make sure all straps are secured so they will not interfere with the operation of the cable reels. 4.2.3.2.  If  the  MOS  is  bidirectional,  drive  to  End-B  threshold,  with  TAG-B aboard,  and  payout  200-ft  runway  cable  segments  from  the  threshold  to  the strobe master unit location (1,200-ft from threshold). If not bidirectional, skip to paragraph 4.2.3.6. 4.2.3.3.  At  the  strobe  master  unit  location  (center  strobe  location)  begin installing  End-B  strobe  segment  as  described  in  T.O.  35E5-3-17-1,  TEAM  B MOS Installation Procedure paragraph. 4.2.3.4. After strobe segment is installed, drop off three approach lights, three 45W isolation transformers, three stakes or ballast rings, and two 10-ft runway cables for the 1,000-ft crossbar. This crossbar should be installed 3 to 5 feet in front of the strobe slave nearest the threshold. 4.2.3.5.  Place  approach  lights,  45W  isolation  transformers,  stakes  or  ballast rings, and 200-ft runway cable from inboard strobe slave unit to the center of the threshold.  Ensure  proper  alignment  with  the  MOS  centerline.  Procedures  for light fixture and transformer placement are provided in T.O. 35F5-3-17-1, Light Fixture, DTG Marker Light, and Transformer Placement paragraph. 4.2.3.6.  At  the  threshold,  place  and  install  End-B  threshold/end  lights,  100W isolation  transformers,  10-ft  runway  cable  and  two  ballast  rings  per  fixture.  If the threshold/end lights are to be installed on a soil surface, place one stake per light fixture instead of ballast rings. Place the 10-ft cable segments so that the male ends of the connectors point in a clockwise direction around the runway. Install fixtures 10-ft from the threshold with the light fixture cord oriented away from the MOS to prevent jet blasts from launching the transformers towards the light  fixtures  and  causing  possible  damage.  Space  the  fixtures  10-ft  apart  and ensure  the  outside  threshold/end  lights  are  lined  up  with  the  edge  lights.  The cable between the light fixture and transformer should be pulled taught so that jet  blasts  do  not  displace  the  transformers  and  cause  movement  of  the  light fixtures. Place two ballast rings on each threshold/end light or stake the fixtures down if possible. 15 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 4.2.3.7. Begin installing End-B approach lights and 45W transformers along the MOS centerline from the center of the threshold towards the strobes. The light fixture  cord  should  be  oriented  perpendicular  to  the  centerline.  Continue installing  approach  lights  until  meeting  TAG-B.  If  TAG-B  has  not  completed their tasks on End-B, assist TAG-B until all End-B tasks are complete. 4.2.3.8.  Pick-up  TAG-B  and  drive  to  the  regulator/control  panel  location  and place 200-ft runway cable from the regulator location to the edge of the MOS (to be connected to the nearest edge light cable connector on the MOS edge). Place 200-ft runway cable segments back to the regulator. 4.2.3.9.  Install  generators  using  procedures  provided  in  T.O.  35F5-3-17-1, TEAM B MOS Installation Procedures paragraph. 4.2.3.10.  Drop  TAG-B  at  End-B  and  place  Edge-B  lights,  RDM  lights  (if applicable),  45  watt  transformers  (for  both  edge  lights  and  RDM  lights),  and 200-ft runway cable segments from End-B threshold to End-A threshold. If light fixtures will be staked down during this installation, place one stake with each light fixture.  Note:  If  the  MOS  is  greater  than  9,000-ft,  disconnect  trailer  #3  and  connect trailer #4 to have sufficient amount of cable for the installation. 4.2.3.11. Begin installing Edge-B lights and RDM lights (if applicable) starting at End-A working towards End- B until meeting up with TAG-B. If the MOS is bidirectional, connect End-B PAPIs to the Edge-B lighting circuit if arriving to the PAPI location before TAG-B. 4.2.3.12. Pick up TAG-B and drive to regulator and control panel location. 4.2.4. TAG-B Installation Sequence. Figure A3.4 displays the route taken and outlines the basic tasks performed by TAG-B during EALS installation. Ensure UXO  are  cleared  in  work  areas  prior  to  beginning  work.  TAG-B  installation procedures are as follows: 4.2.4.1. TAG-B installation procedure begins  with Team-B. Carry out steps in paragraphs  4.2.4.2  and  4.2.4.3  with  Team-B  if  the  MOS  is  bidirectional; otherwise, begin at paragraph 4.2.4.6. 4.2.4.2. Payout 200-foot runway cable segments from End-B threshold to strobe master unit location. 16 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 4.2.4.3. Install End-B strobe segment with Team-B as described in T.O. 35E5-3-17-1, TAG B MOS Installation Procedure paragraph. 4.2.4.4.  Travel  on  foot  to  inboard  strobe  slave  and  install  the  three  End-B crossbar  approach  lights  and  45W  transformers.  The  center  crossbar  approach light should be placed on the approach side of the  near strobe slave unit. The right crossbar approach light should be installed even with the center approach light and 10-ft to the right of the MOS centerline (use 10-ft cable as a measuring device). The left crossbar approach light should be installed even with the center approach light and 10-ft to the left of the MOS centerline. 4.2.4.5. Install End-B approach lights and 45W transformers from the crossbar to  the  center  of  the  End-B  threshold.  The  approach  lights  should  be  installed along  the  centerline  with  the  light  fixture  cord  oriented  perpendicular  to  the centerline.  4.2.4.6.  When  meeting  Team-B  while  installing  End-B  approach  lights,  join Team-B and travel to the regulator and control panel location. 4.2.4.7.  Ground  generators,  regulator,  and  control  panel.  If  a  ground  is  not present, establish a ground by installing three 3-ft ground rods supplied. Connect a separate ground cable from the ground rod to each generator and regulator. 4.2.4.8.  Make  power  and  control  connections  IAW  T.O.  35F5-3-17-1,  Power and Control Electrical Connections paragraph. 4.2.4.9.  Travel  with  Team-B  to  End-B  and  install  edge  light  fixtures,  RDM lights, and transformers toward End-A. Stake the  fixtures  down as  needed. At the  arresting  barrier,  ensure  the  runway  cable  is  clear  of  the  arresting  gear. Team-B  will  be  installing  light  fixtures  and  transformers  along  Edge-B  from End-A toward End-B. If the MOS is bidirectional, connect End-B PAPIs to the Edge-B lighting circuit. 4.2.4.10.  Upon  meeting  Team-B,  proceed  with  Team-B  to  the  regulator  and control panel location and assist Team-A as necessary. 4.3.  Taxiway  Installation  Procedure.  If  damage,  UXO,  equipment,  vehicles, and/or repair personnel prevent MOS installation as described above and results in  work  stoppage,  the  six-man  team  may  begin  taxiway  installation  where available  as  shown  in  T.O.  35F5-3-17-1,  Taxiway  Lighting,  Layout  Figure. Otherwise, perform taxiway installation after MOS lighting has been installed.  17 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016      JOHN B.

Contingency—A  situation requiring  military operations in response to  natural disasters,  terrorists,  subversives,  or  as  otherwise  directed  by  appropriate authority to protect US interests. (JP 5-0) 20 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Contingency Operation—A military operation that is either designated by the Secretary  of  Defense  as  a  contingency  operation  or  becomes  a  contingency operation as a matter of law (Title 10, United States Code, Section 101[a][13]). (JP 1) Debris—Material ejected from the crater including broken pavement and soil. Debris  is  some-times  usable  as  backfill  material  particularly  for  large  crater repair, but for small crater or spall repair it is generally not advisable. Mobile  Aircraft  Arresting  System  (MAAS)—An  aircraft  arresting  system mounted on two identical, four-wheeled towable trailers, one on each side of the runway.  Each  trailer  serves  as  a  storage  and  ground  transportation  and  as  a platform  for  securing  the  basic  arresting  gear  components:  BAK-12  energy absorber, pendent tape, tape connector, hook cable, rewind system, and cooling system. The MAAS can be anchored in concrete, asphalt, or soil in less than 1 hour and is capable of 20 arrested landings per hour. The MAAS is capable of bidirectional  arrestment,  but  if  configured  for  airfield  survivability  application (aborted takeoff and landing aircraft), is unidirectional. Minimum Airfield Operating Surface (MAOS)—The combined requirement for airfield surfaces for both runway and access routes. The MOS is part of the MAOS. Minimum Operating Strip (MOS)—1. A runway  which meets the minimum requirements  for  operating  assigned  and/or  allocated  aircraft  types  on  a particular  airfield  at  maximum  or  combat  gross  weight.  2.  The  MOS  is  the smallest  area  to  be  repaired  to  launch  and/or  recover  aircraft  after  an  attack. Selection depends upon mission requirements, taxi access, resources available, and  estimated  time  to  repair.  For  fighter  aircraft,  the  typically  accepted dimensions are 5,000 feet long by 50 feet wide. Mission—1. The task, together with the purpose, that clearly indicates the action to  be  taken  and  the  reason  therefore.  2.  In  common  usage,  especially  when applied to lower military units, a duty assigned to an individual or unit; a task. 3. The dispatching of one or more aircraft to accomplish one particular task. (JP 1-02) Personnel—Those individuals required in either a military or civilian capacity to accomplish the assigned mission. Procedures—Standard,  detailed  steps  that  prescribe  how  to  perform  specific tasks. 21 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Recovery  operations—Operations  conducted  to  search  for,  locate,  identify, recover, and return isolated personnel, human remains, sensitive equipment, or items critical to national security.

Runway—A  defined  rectangular  area  of  an  airfield,  prepared  for  the  landing and  takeoff  of  aircraft  along  its  length.  A  runway  is  measured  from  the  outer edge of the thresholds from one end of the runway to the others. The width of the  runway  is  typically  measured  from  the  outer  edge  of  the  load-bearing pavement  on  one  side  to  the  outer  edge  of  the  load-bearing  pavement  on  the other side. In some cases the runway may be measured from the outside edge of the runway marking line on one side to the outside edge of the marking line on the other side and any remaining load bearing pavement is considered shoulder. Runway edge—One of the long sides of the runway/MOS. EDGE A is the side in the clockwise (left) direction from end A. EDGE B is the other side (right). Runway Threshold/End—The threshold is the beginning portion of the usable pavement as viewed by the approaching pilot. The runway end is the last portion of the usable runway/MOS available to a pilot. Green lights mark the threshold end, and red lights mark the runway end. When the threshold of a runway is co-located with the end of the opposite runway, the threshold/end lights have a split lens with green on one side and red on the other. Support—1. The action of a force that aids, protects, complements, or sustains another force in accordance with a directive requiring such action. 2. A unit that helps another unit in battle. 3. An element of a command that assists, protects, or supplies other forces in combat. (JP 1-02) Tactics—1.  The  employment  of  units  in  combat.  2.  The  ordered  arrangement and maneuver of units in relation to each other and/or to the enemy in order to use their full potentialities. (JP 1-02) TAG—1-person installation team. Taxiway—A  specially-prepared  or  designated  path  on  an  airfield  or  heliport, other  than  apron  areas,  on  which  aircraft  move  under  their  own  power  to  and from landing, takeoff, service, and parking areas. 22 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Techniques—Non-prescriptive  ways  or  methods  use  to  perform  missions, functions, or tasks. Unexploded  Explosive  Ordnance  (UXO)—Explosive  ordnance  which  has been primed, fuzed, armed, or otherwise prepared for action, and which has been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard  to  operations,  installations,  personnel,  or  material,  and  remains unexploded either by malfunction or design. (JP 3-15, JP 1-02) Unidirectional  Runway—A  condition  where,  for  whatever  reason,  aircraft takeoff and land on the runway in only one direction.    23 AFTTP 3-32.14                                                         1 APRIL 2016 Attachment 2 PREINSTALLATION CHECKLISTS  Table A2.1.
