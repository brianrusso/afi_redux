General  Guidelines:  All  Air  Force  military,  civilian  and  contract  personnel  will  use  the following  standardized  procedures  when  handling  Air  Force  SA/LW  or  SA/LW  provided  by another service.  (T-1).  After coordination with the Air Force Security Forces Center, Combat Arms  Branch  (AFSFC/FGWL),  HQ  USAF/A4SX  Combat  Arms  Policy  must  approve  any deviation to these procedures prior to implementation at the major command (MAJCOM) or unit level.  (T-1).  The clearing barrel attendant and the armorer will not engage in any other duties or functions  during  the  period  of  weapons  handling.    (T-1).    Attachments  2  through  18  address specific  loading  and  unloading/clearing  procedures  in  detail  for  each  weapon.    All  personnel must  follow  these  procedures  during  issue  and  turn-in.    (T-1).    Upon  completion  of  duties requiring  SA/LW  and  before  returning  weapons  to  storage  or  relinquishing  custody  to  an authorized  individual,  personnel  must  unload/clear  their  weapons  following  the  procedures  in this  manual.    (T-1).    HQ  USAF/A4SX  must  approve  unit-developed,  weapons  handling procedures for SA/LW that are not addressed in this publication.  The MAJCOM/A4S approves local  procedures  for  on-post  clearing/loading  and  arming  configurations  based  on  local requirements  or  conditions  (unique  local  procedures  must  be  detailed  in  contingency  plans, operating  instructions  or  other  appropriate  installation/unit  documents).    (T-1).    Personnel assigned  to  Armories  will  control  access  to  SA/LW  and  be  familiar  with  requirements  in accordance  with  AFI  31-101,  Integrated  Defense  (FOUO);  AFI  31-117,  Arming  and  Use  of Force  by  Air  Force  Personnel;  1-204,  Combat  Arms  Program;  AFCAT  21-209  Volume  1, Ground Munitions; and this manual.  (T-1).  Note:  Throughout this manual, the use of the word "Armory" applies to all locations storing any quantity of SA/LW, regardless of their intended use or temporary/permanent status of the location. 1.2.  Zeroing  SA/LW:  Commanders  will  ensure  all  individual  SA/LW  carried  by  Air  Force personnel  for  armed  duty  are  zeroed  (sights  adjusted)  for  the  individual  carrying  the  weapon (This does not apply to weapons with fixed/non-adjustable sights).  (T-1).  The preferred method to accomplish this is live-fire zero.  Machine guns, grenade launchers and unassigned SA/LW are previously zeroed either by live-fire, laser bore sighting or as a minimum, mechanically zeroed and  properly  maintained  to  ensure  the  sight  settings  are  not  changed.    When  there  is  an inadequate  number  of  available  weapons  to  individually  assign  and  live-fire  zero,  commanders may approve the use of alternative methods authorized by AFSFC/FGWL to ensure the weapon is  zeroed  to  the  assigned  individual  (such  as  the  use  of  approved  laser  bore  sighting  devices).  Although not mandatory, the preferred method of accomplishing live-fire zero is to use the same type of ammunition carried for duty.  Include guidance for these procedures in base publications.  For contingency operations, all weapons carried  by Air  Force personnel  must be zeroed by the deploying individual prior to  departing the home station  or staging  area.    (T-1).   If individuals cannot  accomplish  live-fire  zero  on  assigned  weapons  that  are  pre-positioned  at  deployed locations,  the  SA/LW  will  be  zeroed  using  bore  sighting  devices/methods  approved  by AFSFC/FGWL. 1.3.  Standardized  Air  Force  SA/LW  Safety  Rules:  As a minimum, Air Force members will comply  with  the  following  safety  rules  anytime  they  handle  SA/LW.    (T-1).    Units  will 6 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 prominently  display  these  safety  rules  in  the  same  manner  as  the  SA/LW  loading/clearing procedures covered in paragraph 4.2.  (T-1).  1.3.1.  Treat all weapons as if they are loaded at all times. 1.3.2.  Never point a weapon at anything you are not willing to shoot. 1.3.3.  Keep  your  weapon  on  safe  until  you  are  ready  to  fire  (does  not  apply  to  SA/LW designed without a manual safety or those directed to be carried in the “fire” position in this manual). 1.3.4.  Keep  your  finger  off  the  trigger  until  your  sights  are  on  target  and  you  are  ready  to fire. 1.3.5.  Positively identify your target and know what is around and behind it. 1.3.6.  Never engage in horseplay while handling weapons. 1.4.  Designating  Armorers  and  Clearing  Barrel  Attendants:  Armorers  and  clearing  barrel attendants  are  not  required  to  maintain  qualification  on  all  the  weapons  they  handle/supervise; however, they must be trained and certified by unit trainers on the SA/LW handling procedures outlined in this manual, or the weapon operator’s manual if not included in this publication.  (T-1).  1.4.1.  Armorer/clearing  barrel safety, loading/clearing/unloading  procedures  for  each  weapon  handled  or  supervised  and  clearing barrel procedures.  (T-1).  To remain qualified, armorers and clearing barrel attendants must successfully complete annual training and certification provided by certified unit trainers on each weapon they handle/supervise.  (T-1). include  weapon attendant training  must 1.4.2.  Document  initial  training/certification  on  AF  Form  797,  Job  Qualification  Standard Continuation/Command  JQS  and  recurring  training/certification  on  AF  Form  1098,  Special Task  Certification  and  Recurring  Training.    This  training  does  not  authorize  armorers  and clearing barrel attendants to be armed.  If they have an arming requirement, individuals must meet all the requirements outlined in AFI 31-117 and AFI 36-2654 in order to be armed.  (T-1). 1.4.3.  Armorers, clearing barrel attendants and trainers must have a current DD Form 2760, Qualification  to  Possess  Firearms  or  Ammunition,  and  be  in  compliance  with  the  Gun Control Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. § 922(d)(9) and (g)(9)/Lautenberg Amendment) regardless of whether  they  will  be  armed,  as  outlined  in  AFI  31-117.    All  personnel  entering  the  armory must be in compliance with the Gun Control Act of 1968.  (T-0). 1.5.  SA/LW Handling Areas:  The SA/LW handling area is an area free from distractions and provides  a  safe  environment  for  weapons  loading  and  clearing.    This  area  is  usually  in  close proximity  to  the  armory  and  contains  one  or  more  approved  clearing  barrels  and  “clearing zones.” 1.5.1.  During  field  deployments  or  in-place  relief  of  personnel,  the  commander  must designate  an  area,  or  areas  for  weapons  handling  (loading  or  clearing)  when  a  standard handling area with a clearing barrel is not available.  (T-1). 1.5.2.  Gun crews only live load and clear the M2 machine gun, MK19 machine gun, grenade launcher and .50 caliber rifles in designated clearing area(s).  Due to the maximum range and AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 7 destructive  capabilities  of  these  weapons,  clearing  barrels  are  not  used  to  load/clear  live munitions. 1.5.2.1.  The designated clearing area will be an open area, where in the event a round is discharged, the impact of the round(s) will cause minimal damage or chances of injury.  Note:  This requirement does not apply to real world responses to imminent threats. 1.5.2.2.  Commanders  should  consider  the  maximum  range  and  ordinate  of  ammunition used,  as  well  as  the  terminal  effect  of  high  explosive  munitions  when  selecting  a designated clearing area. 1.5.3.  Commanders will ensure that current Air Force approved operator’s manuals for each model weapon maintained are available in  each SA/LW handling area or  armory, when the handling area is adjacent to the armory.  (T-1). 1.5.4.  Special considerations for armed aircrew members.  Aircrew members and others on a military  aircraft  required  to  be  armed  in  the  performance  of  their  duties  will  load  their SA/LW at an approved clearing area using an authorized clearing barrel prior to boarding the aircraft.    (T-1).    Individuals  will  not  unload  their  weapons  until  they  return  to  a  DoD installation and are able to use an approved clearing area/barrel, unless this option becomes available at en route stops.  (T-1).  If the aircraft makes en route stops where SA/LW cannot be removed from the aircraft to be cleared as required in this manual, the aircraft commander may  authorize  the  weapons  to  be  temporarily  stored  in  a  loaded  configuration  in  a  locked container  attached  to  the  aircraft.    If  stored  in  a  weapons  case,  the  case  will  be  locked  and chained/secured to the aircraft.  The aircraft commander will ensure all doors are locked and sealed prior to departing the aircraft and that weapons/ammunition are inventoried/accounted for upon return.  (T-1).  Individuals will store handguns in the holster, without removing the weapon from the holster and magazine fed rifles/carbines (e.g., M4, M4A1, M16A2) with the magazine removed before storing, with the loaded magazine(s) placed in  a separate, locked container.    (T-1).    At  no  time  will  any  personnel  attempt  to  clear,  load  or  operate  SA/LW onboard  the  aircraft  unless  it  becomes  necessary  to  employ  deadly  force,  as  authorized  in AFI 31-117.  (T-1). 1.6.  Clearing  Zone:  The  clearing  zone  is  the  space  inside  the  “red  lines”  within  the  weapons handling  area,  immediately  surrounding  the  clearing  barrel.    The  clearing  zone  must  have  red lines on the floor for easy identification (ropes or cones may be used in a field environment).  (T-2).    Only  the  clearing  barrel  attendant  and  the  individual  clearing  their  weapon  are  allowed within the clearing zone during loading/clearing  operations.  All  other persons waiting to  enter the clearing zone will form a line outside the clearing zone.  Clearing zones are constructed as follows: 1.6.1.  A  red  line  identifying  the  clearing  zone  is  at  least  4-inches  wide.    The  line  can  be painted, taped or incorporated into the floor tile pattern. 1.6.2.  The line identifying the front of the clearing zone is at least 6 feet from the front of the clearing barrel. 1.6.3.  The clearing zone is at least 6 feet wide (3 feet on either side of the clearing barrel’s centerline).  If the clearing barrel is positioned against a wall, the clearing zone is extended to the wall and the wall must be constructed of material that will prevent all calibers and types of  ammunition  loaded/unloaded  at  the  clearing  barrel  from  penetrating  the  wall  or  the 8 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 guidance in paragraph 1.6.5. must be followed.  (T-1).  Additionally, it is recommended that the  wall  be  covered  with  a  one-sheet  layer  of  3/4  inch  and  a  one-sheet  layer  of  1/2  inch plywood or similar material to reduce the possibility of splash back from any projectiles that may strike the wall. 1.6.4.  The  clearing  zone  is  illuminated  to  provide  sufficient  lighting  to  view  the  chamber area of all SA/LW loaded and cleared at the location. 1.6.5.  The location of the clearing barrel cannot permit movement behind (to the rear of) the barrel.  If the area behind the clearing zone is occupied, a barrier is put in place to the rear of the  barrel  constructed  of  material  that  will  prevent  all  calibers  and  types  of  ammunition loaded/  unloaded  at  the  clearing  barrel  from  penetrating  the  barrier.    Additionally,  it  is recommended that the barrier be covered with a one-sheet layer of three quarter inch and a one-sheet  layer  of  one  half  inch  plywood  or  similar  material  to  reduce  the  possibility  of splash back from any projectiles that may strike the barrier. 1.7.  Waiver  requests  for  this  publication  (AFMAN  31-129):  HQ  USAF/A4SX,  Combat Arms Policy, is the waiver approving authority for non-tiered requirements in this publication.

Ensure safe handling of all weapons and use the procedures outlined in attachments 2 through 18 to this manual.  (T-1). 2.6.2.  Ensure individuals needing to clear SA/LW enter and exit the clearing zone only when directed.  (T-2). 2.6.3.  Ensure individuals proceed directly to  the clearing zone after receiving their weapon from the armorer.  (T-2). 2.6.4.  Ensure  all  personnel  approach  the  clearing  barrel  with  their  shoulder  weapons  at “port-arms” and handguns at “raised pistol” with the barrel pointed up and action open (if not loaded).  (T-2). 2.6.5.  Ensure  individuals  keep  the  muzzle  of  their  weapon  centered  in  the  clearing  barrel aiming  point  and  in  line  with  the  clearing  barrel’s  axis  during  all  weapons  loading  and clearing procedures.  (T-1). 2.6.6.  Ensure cleared weapons and munitions are returned to the armorer.  (T-1). 2.6.7.  Wear  of  ballistic  resistant  safety  glasses.    It  is  highly  encouraged  that  safety  glasses are available for use by  individuals clearing weapons at  the clearing barrel  and are in  good condition so that visibility is not hindered. 2.6.8.  Focus on the weapon handling actions of the individual loading/clearing the weapon at all  times.    If  the  attendant  needs  to  look  at  printed  or  posted  loading/clearing  procedures during the process or take their eyes off the person handling the weapon for any reason, they stop the individual loading/clearing at the step they have just completed, read the applicable step,  return  their  eyes  to  the  individual  loading/clearing  and  direct  them  to  proceed  to  the next step.  (T-1). AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 11 Chapter 3 WEAPONS ISSUE AND TURN IN 3.1.  Issuing SA/LW:  Control all SA/LW issued to individuals by keeping a receipt showing the type of weapon (including model number), serial number, printed name, qualification expiration date and signature of the person to whom the weapon is issued.  Although butt numbers may be used to simplify record keeping, each receipt bears the serial number of the issued weapon. 3.1.1.  SA/LW  Hand  Receipt.    Use  AF  Form  629,  Small  Arms  Hand  Receipt  or  SFMIS generated version, to  act  as a receipt for issue of SA/LW to  individuals who are  frequently issued an assigned weapon, such as Security  Forces (SF).   Once the form  is  complete, it is laminated  or  printed  to  prevent  tampering  and  to  preserve  the  form.    Use  of  indefinite weapons qualification expiration dates is not authorized.  The specific date is used.  Since all weapons qualifications expire the last day of the appropriate month, expiration dates may be shown as month and year, for example "Dec 15." 3.1.2.  Temporary  Issue Receipt.  Use AF  Form 1297,  Temporary Issue  Receipt, to  act  as a receipt  for  issue  of  SA/LW  to  individuals  when  AF  Form  629  is  not  used.    The  AF  Form 1297  includes  all  the  information  required  in  paragraph  3.1.  except  qualification  expiration date(s).  The form also includes the date the weapon(s) were issued to the individual, the date they  will  be  returned,  as  well  as  the  printed  name  of  the  individual  issuing  the  weapon(s).  Note:    During SA/LW training events, such as Combat Arms qualification training classes, all  weapons  for  the  class  may  be  issued  to  one  instructor/individual  on  an  AF  Form  1297, who will maintain surveillance of all weapons issued to students.  It is not necessary to have each student sign a separate receipt, unless there will be no responsible individual appointed to maintain surveillance and accountability of all issued weapons.  In this case, each student must sign a receipt.  (T-1). 3.1.3.  Units  may  use  a  memorandum  to  issue  large  quantities  of  SA/LW  to  individuals charged with providing protection and custody of these items.  The memorandum includes all the information required in paragraph 3.1.2. 3.1.4.  The  armorer  issues  all  ammunition  and  associated  weapon  system  equipment,  if  not attached  to  the  weapon  system,  to  individuals  prior  to  issuing  them  the  weapon(s).    After loading the weapons, and upon direction of the clearing barrel attendant, individuals proceed out of the clearing zone to the locally designated area. 3.2.  Arming  Authorization:  The  armorer  verifies  the  arming  authorization  of  the  person(s) requesting a weapon through review of the signed, written authorization, as directed by AFI 31-117.  Additions and deletions to the authorization throughout the month must be documented in accordance with the guidance contained in AFI 31-117.  The armorer verifies each individual’s current authorization to bear arms and check any “Do Not Arm Lists,” before issuing SA/LW to any personnel. 3.2.1.  For  SF  personnel,  regardless  of  who  authenticates  the  authority  to  bear  arms,  the armorer  confirms  each  individual’s  authorization  to  draw  a  weapon  or  ammunition  at  the time  of  issue.    For  on-duty  SF  personnel,  this  confirmation  is  usually  accomplished  by reviewing  the  duty  roster.    Additionally,  prior  to  issuing  a  weapon  to  a  Security  Forces 12 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 member,  the  armorer  must  ensure  the  member  is  not  currently  listed  on  the  “Do  Not  Arm List.” 3.2.2.  For  weapons  courtesy  stored  in  Security  Forces  or  other  armories,  commanders owning  the  SA/LW  provide  the  supporting  armory  a  listing  of  individuals  authorized  to remove their unit’s weapons from the armory. 3.2.3.  Individuals  who  are  issued  a  SA/LW  and  will  not  be  armed  (see  glossary)  are  not required  to  be  qualified  IAW  AFI  36-2654  or  to  have  current  UoF  training;  however,  they must comply with the Gun Control Act of 1968 requirements as outlined in AFI 31-117 and have a current DD Form 2760.  (T-0). 3.3.  Weapons  Turn-In:  When  returning  SA/LW  to  the  armory,  the  clearing  barrel  attendant monitors all weapons handling and clearing procedures.  After clearing the weapons, and upon direction of the clearing barrel attendant, individuals proceed directly to the turn-in point.  They carry shoulder weapons at “port-arms” and handguns at “raised pistol” with the barrel pointed up and action open.  Individuals turn-in their weapons to the armorer, butt first and muzzle elevated.  Individuals also normally return munitions and related equipment at this time. AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 13 Chapter 4 CLEARING BARRELS 4.1.  Clearing Barrels:  Only use clearing barrels outlined in this chapter in designated clearing zones.  All clearing barrels are checked for serviceability annually.  Document the annual check on a DD Form 1574, Serviceable Tag, and affix the form to the clearing barrel.  When the form is full, replace it with a new form and retain the old form in the section safety book until the new form is full and replaced.  Clearing barrels must be secured in place (e.g., bolted to the floor or wall) so that they cannot fall over or move out of position. 4.1.1.  Commercial-Off-The-Shelf  (COTS)  Clearing  Barrels.    AFSFC/FGWL  maintains  a memorandum  of  HQ  USAF/A4SX  approved  COTS  clearing  barrels  on  the  USAF  Combat Arms,  Air  Force  Network  (AFNet),  Enterprise  Information  Services  (EIS)  website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).    The  using  unit  may  request  approval  of additional COTS clearing barrels from HQ USAF/A4SX.  Unit commanders submit requests electronically  with  documentation  on  the  specifications  and  design  of  the  barrel/device  to AFSFC/FGWL for review and possible testing.  AFSFC/FGWL provides HQ USAF/A4SX a recommendation for approval or disapproval. 4.1.2.  Locally  Constructed  Clearing  Barrels.    Units  should  first  consider  COTS  clearing barrels  when replacing locally  constructed barrels.  Units may  construct  clearing barrels  by filling 30-gallon, metal containers with pea gravel or sand.  Clearing barrels must be at least 14 inches wide and 24 inches deep.  (T-2).   If sand is used instead of pea gravel, ensure the sand stays dry. 4.1.3.  For  all  clearing  barrel  types  (locally  constructed  or  COTS),  unless  otherwise stipulated, unit commanders will ensure each clearing barrel: 4.1.3.1.  Is  mounted  at  a  height  and  angle  to  permit  safe  and  smooth  weapons  clearing.  (T-1). 4.1.3.2.  Has  a  tray  with  rubber  matting  affixed  under  the  aiming  point  of  the  barrel  to prevent dropped rounds from falling to the ground.  (T-1).   The tray must be at least 10 inches wide and 5 inches deep.  (T-3).  Note:  Trays in use as of the publication date of this  manual  that  do  not  meet  these  specifications  may  be  continued  in  use  until  the clearing barrel is repaired or replaced. 4.1.3.3.  Has the  floor area below the  clearing zone covered by  rubber or other resilient matting to help prevent damage or primer detonation of a dropped round.  (T-1). 4.1.3.4.  Has an aiming point in the center of the front lid at least 4 inches in diameter and 1  inch  in  depth,  but  not  exceeding  4  inches  deep  (not  applicable  to  COTS  clearing barrels).  (T-1).  Note:  Clearing barrels in use as of the publication date of this manual that do not meet these specifications may be continued in use until the clearing barrel is repaired or replaced. 4.1.3.5.  Has a 3/4 inch piece of plywood or thick rubber matting (at least 1/4 inch thick) covering the diameter of the container fitted directly behind the lid to reinforce it against muzzle blast (not applicable for COTS clearing barrels).  (T-1).  Note:  Clearing barrels 14 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 in use as of the publication date of this manual that do not meet these specifications may be continued in use until the clearing barrel is repaired or replaced. 4.2.  Written  Procedures:  Post  written  SA/LW  loading/clearing  procedures  above  each clearing  barrel  for  each  type  of  government  weapon  routinely  loaded/cleared  at  the  location.  Procedures may be printed on charts or interchangeable cards; however, the print must be large enough to ensure easy reading from inside the clearing zone.  In overseas locations, also display the written loading/clearing procedures in the host-nation language if host-nation personnel use the US armory or handling area.  Hand-held, laminated cards or checklists may be used only by the clearing barrel official in less permanent clearing areas such as field conditions and for very infrequently used weapons (less than twice a month on average). 4.3.  Armory  Clearing  Barrel:  Armories  must  contain  a  clearing  barrel  to  facilitate  weapons inspections  at  issue  and  turn-in.    (T-1).    This  barrel  must  be  an  approved  COTS  barrel  or  a locally  constructed  barrel  meeting  the  requirements  of  paragraph  4.1.3.,  other  than  the  tray requirement  in  paragraph  4.1.3.2.    (T-1).    The  barrel  may  be  mounted  securely  on  the  floor,  a wall or ceiling near the issue window, at a height and angle permitting safe and smooth weapons inspections.  Five-gallon inspection barrels are no longer authorized after one calendar year from the publication date of this manual. 4.4.  Loading  and  Unloading  SA/LW  Inside  Armory:  Personnel  will  not  load  or  unload SA/LW with live ammunition inside armories.  (T-1). AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 15 Chapter 5 BLANK AMMUNITION, DYE-MARKING CARTRIDGES AND EXERCISE SAFETY 5.1.  Blank and Dye-Marking Ammunition:  Individuals are not required to be qualified IAW AFI  36-2654  or  have  current  UoF  training  to  participate  in  exercises,  training  or  Honor  Guard duties  using  SA/LW  with  blank  or  dye-marking  ammunition  (used  with  the  Close  Combat Mission Capability Kit [CCMCK]).  They must be in compliance with Gun Control Act of 1968 requirements as outlined in AFI 31-117 and have a current DD Form 2760.  (T-0).  Individuals participating in training with these munitions must be familiar with all safety requirements, have a working knowledge of the weapon and be able to distinguish between live, dye-marking, less than  lethal  and  blank  ammunition.    (T-1).    Individual  units  will  provide  their  own  training  to emphasize safe handling, weapon operation, use of blank ammunition and operator maintenance.  (T-1).  Personnel providing training should be qualified by Combat Arms on the weapon before training  others;  however,  they  must  be  familiar  with  all  safety  requirements,  have  a  working knowledge of the weapon and be able to distinguish between live, dye-marking, less than lethal and blank ammunition.  (T-1).  Unit training personnel document this training on AF Form 797.  Unit training personnel accomplish this training annually and document it on AF Form 1098, if a requirement  continues  to  exist.    Dye-marking  (also  known  as,  man-marker  rounds  or  marking rounds)  munitions  are  used  with  the  CCMCK  to  provide  non-lethal  force-on-force  training capabilities  with  SA/LW.    All  personnel  conducting  or  participating  in  CCMCK  training  must meet  the  additional  training  requirements  outlined  in  HQ  USAF/A4SX  Close  Combat  Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) Training Concept of Operations (CONOPS)  and the training program must comply with the guidance contained in this CONOPS.   (T-1).  The CONOPS is available on  the  USAF  Combat  Arms,  AFNet,  EIS  website  (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/).  Units must also follow the guidance in Air Force Technical Order (TO) 11W2-9-4-11, Technical Manual Operator’s Manual for Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK).  (T-1).  5.1.1.  Store  blank/dye-marking  ammunition  in  separate  containers  from  live  ammunition.  To  ensure  appropriate  segregation  and  storage,  blank/dye-marking  ammunition  and  live ammunition  will  not  be  stored  side-by-side.    (T-2).    Blank/dye-marking  ammunition containers  and  weapon  magazines  will  be  marked  in  a  manner  making  them  easily identifiable  as  containing  non-live  ammunition.    (T-1).    Consider  painting  a  blue,  two-inch wide  stripe  across  the  top  of  the  blank/dye-marking  ammunition  container.    For  weapons with  magazines, consider distinctive two-inch wide, blue stripe painted or taped around the bottom of the magazine for blank/dye-marking ammunition use. 5.1.2.  During  any  exercise  where  blank/dye-marking  ammunition  is  used,  an  officer  or noncommissioned officer will: 5.1.2.1.  Physically  inspect  all  exercise  participants  to  ensure  they  are  not  carrying  live ammunition.  (T-1). 5.1.2.2.  Inspect  ammunition  and  magazines to  ensure  only  blank/dye-marking ammunition  is  employed.    This  will  include  a  joint  inspection  with  the  armorer  when ammunition is issued from and turned into the armory.  (T-1). 16 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 5.1.2.3.  Ensure  all  exercise  participants  are  aware  of  the  physical  differences  between live,  dye-marking,  less  than  lethal  and  blank/dye-marking  ammunition  and  can  readily identify each.  (T-1). 5.1.2.4.  Brief  all  exercise  participants  that  weapons  loaded  with  blanks  and  equipped with blank firing attachments or adapters, are not to be pointed and fired at any individual within 20 feet of the muzzle unless technical data dictates a greater distance.  (T-1). 5.1.2.5.  When  personnel  in  the  exercise  area  must  be  armed  with  live  ammunition  for force or personal protection, the commander will ensure they are clearly identifiable from exercise  participants  and  their  SA/LW  are  also  clearly  identifiable  as  containing  live ammunition.  (T-1).  Consider the use of reflective vests for armed personnel and brightly colored  reflective  tape  for  SA/LW  carrying  live  ammunition.    Notify  all  exercise participants  of  the  means  used  to  identify  individuals  and  weapons  armed/loaded  with live ammunition.  (T-1). 5.2.  Exercise  Safety:  Unit  commanders  will  develop  and  implement  written  guidelines  for SA/LW safety tailored specifically to exercises or training.  (T-1).  At a minimum, the guidelines are as follows: 5.2.1.  Establish  local  procedures  for  conducting  exercises  or  training  with  blank/dye-marking ammunition. 5.2.2.  Establish local procedures for conducting exercises or training where live ammunition is present for guard or security purposes. 5.2.3.  Address procedures for clearing (removing ammunition) weapons prior to leaving the exercise area upon completion of any exercise scenario. 5.2.4.  Ensure  handguns  are  carried  in  an  authorized  holster  and  exercise  area  storage procedures are addressed. 5.2.5.  Address emergency action procedures should an accident or incident occur. 5.2.6.  Establish  emergency  notification  procedures  prior  to  the  exercise.    Include  at  a minimum:  Base  Defense  Operations  Center  (BDOC),  command  post,  medical,  fire, Explosive Ordnance Disposal, safety and local authorities as required, if off the installation.  Ensure the BDOC knows the exercise location. 5.2.7.  Establish  weapons  and  ammunition  disposition  procedures  in  the  event  an  exercise participant becomes injured, sick or incapacitated for any reason. 5.2.8.  Establish local procedures ensuring accountability of exercise or training ammunition. 5.2.9.  Establish a training and certification program for exercise or training supervisors. 5.2.10.  Appoint,  in  writing,  exercise  or  training  supervisors,  ammunition  custodians  and personnel armed with live ammunition. 5.2.11.  If possible, ensure radio contact is maintained with the exercise control center, range control or the exercise controllers during all exercises. AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 17 Chapter 6 DECONTAMINATION OF SA/LW IN A CHEMICAL, BIOLOGICAL, RADIOLOGICAL OR NUCLEAR ENVIRONMENT 6.1.  Decontamination:  Weapons  are  difficult  to  completely  decontaminate  because  of lubricants  that  trap  agents.    Additionally,  chemical  droplets  may  get  into  hard  to  reach  places within the weapon’s parts. 6.2.  Immediate Action:  Contaminated weapons should be decontaminated within minutes after exposure, if possible, using the M291, Skin Decontamination Kit or M295, Individual Equipment Decontamination  Kit.    Use  water-soaked  rags  to  remove  the  decontamination  kit's  powder residue.  When feasible, thoroughly  decontaminate the weapon by  disassembling it and rinsing parts  in  a  five  percent  chlorine  solution.    When  practical,  expose  contaminated  weapons  to moving  air.    Always  wear  protective  mask  and  gloves  when  cleaning  contaminated  weapons.  Decontaminate the weapons cleaning tools (cleaning rod and brush) with a five percent chlorine solution.  Dispose of the used weapons cleaning materials as contaminated waste. 6.3.  Enclosed  Space  Handling:  Previously  contaminated  weapons  may  become  inhalation hazards  to  unmasked  personnel  within  closed  or  unventilated  areas.    Whenever  a  previously contaminated weapon is not required for immediate use, it should be double wrapped in plastic bags to contain the residual hazard and prevent exposures to low-level chemical vapors.

M203  series  GL  loading/unloading  procedures  are  IAW  TO 11W3-9-4-1,  Technical  Manual  Operators  Manual  Grenade  Launcher,  40-MM:  M203.    The M203  series  GL  is  intended  to  be  mounted  to  either  the  M16A2  rifle  or  M4  carbine.    The grenadier must be aware that either adding or the removal of the GL from the rifle or carbine will have  an  effect  on  the  zero  of  the  rifle/carbine.    Permanent  removal  of  the  M203A2  from  the rifle/carbine when using the quick release mount requires the user to  re-accomplish zero of the sights  on  the  rifle/carbine,  if  they  were  zeroed  with  the  GL  mounted.    Likewise,  if  the rifle/carbine  is  zeroed  without  the  GL  mounted,  mounting  the  GL  changes  the  zero  of  the rifle/carbine.    Because  the  weapon  system  consists  of  both  rifle/carbine  and  GL,  clearing  and handling  must  be  inclusive  of  both  rifle/carbine  and  GL  procedures.    Clearing  and  handling procedures, to include issue and turn-in, are completed with the GL mounted to the rifle/carbine.  Unit commanders may prescribe whether the rifle or the GL is cleared first, as the carbine barrel will  not  fit  into  some  clearing  barrels  when  the  GL  barrel  is  in  the  forward  position.    Note:  Future references to the GL include the rifle or carbine with GL attached and future references to the “rifle” include the carbine. A7.2.  Issue.

M320 GL loading/unloading procedures are IAW TO 11W3-9-7-1, Operator’s Manual for Grenade Launcher, 40MM, M320, W/E.  The M320 GL is intended to be mounted to either the M16 series rifle or M4 series carbine.  The grenadier must be aware that either mounting or removing the GL from the rifle or carbine will have an effect on the zero of the rifle/carbine.  Permanent  removal of the M320 from  the rifle/carbine when using the quick release function requires the user to re-accomplish zero of the sights on the rifle/carbine, if they were  zeroed  with  the  GL  mounted.    Likewise,  if  the  rifle/carbine  is  zeroed  without  the  GL mounted,  mounting  the  GL  changes  the  zero  of  the  rifle/carbine.    Because  the  weapon  system consists  of  both  rifle/carbine  and  GL,  clearing  and  handling  must  be  inclusive  of  both rifle/carbine and GL procedures.  Unit commanders may prescribe whether the rifle or the GL is cleared  first.    Note:    If  approved  for  use  in  the  stand-alone  configuration,  the  M320  will  be issued, cleared, loaded and turned-in using the same procedures as a mounted GL.  (T-1).  Future references  to  the  GL  include  the  rifle  or  carbine  with  GL  attached  and  future  references  to  the “rifle” include the carbine unless otherwise specified. A9.2.  Issue.  The armorer will use the following procedures when issuing the M320 GL: A9.2.1.  Remove  the  GL  from  its  storage  rack  or  container  and  proceed  to  the  issue-point clearing area in the “port-arms” position.  (T-1). A9.2.2.  Place the muzzle in the clearing barrel aiming point in line with the axis of the barrel and visually inspect the weapon system to ensure there is no magazine in the rifle.  (T-1).  Do not  place  fingers  into  the  trigger  guards.    Note:    If  the  M320  is  in  the  stand-alone configuration, place the  muzzle of the GL into the clearing barrel  aiming point in  line with the axis of the barrel and proceed to paragraph A9.2.5.  (T-1). A9.2.3.  Pull  the  rifle  charging  handle  to  the  rear  while  depressing  the  lower  portion  of  the bolt catch, and lock the bolt to the rear (open) position.  (T-1).

The  individual issued the AR will use the following procedures: A11.4.1.1.  Ensure the AR is cleared; the cover closed, bolt is forward with the safety on fire.  (T-1). A11.4.1.2.  Attach  the  ammunition  assault  pack  into  the  receiver  dovetail  located underneath the receiver.  (T-1). A11.4.1.3.  Visually inspect the assault pack bandoleer to ensure all ammunition has the open side of the belt links pointing downward.  (T-1). A11.4.1.4.  Open the cover and place the ammunition belt onto the feed tray with the belt links open side pointing downward.  (T-1).  Place the first round on the feed tray groove against  the  cartridge  stop.    (T-1).    The  lead-link  tab  (green  plastic  tab)  assists  in  the correct positioning of the ammunition belt.  (T-1). A11.4.1.5.  Close the cover.  (T-1).  The AR is now half-loaded.  Ammunition is inserted, the bolt is forward and the safety remains on fire.  If accomplished correctly, the lead-link tab  is  visible  on  the  right  side  of  the  AR,  flush  against  the  ejection  port.    Under  no circumstances should the safety be engaged with the bolt in the forward position. A11.4.1.6.  The  half-load  can  also  be  achieved  with  the  30-round,  M16-style  magazine.  The bolt is forward, the safety is on fire, the cover is closed and the magazine is inserted into  the  magazine  well.    The  use  of  a  magazine  should  be  used  as  a  last  resort,  when MAJCOMs authorize this configuration and belted ammunition is not available or is not suitable for tactical operations. A11.4.2.  Full-Load.  The full-load may be achieved by starting with a cleared AR or an AR in  the  half-load  configuration.    The  full  load  should  only  be  used  when  hostilities  are expected and the AR must be available to fire with minimal delay. A11.4.2.1.  From  a  Half-Load.    The  individual  issued  the  AR  will  use  the  following procedures: A11.4.2.1.1.  When transitioning to the full-load from the half-load, pull and hold the cocking handle to the rear, locking the bolt to the rear (open) position.  (T-1).  Return the cocking handle to  the forward position and place the safety to  the safe position.  (T-1).  Leave the weapon on safe if there is not a need to immediately fire.  (T-1). A11.4.2.1.2.  The AR is now fully loaded.  Ammunition is on the feed tray, the bolt is locked to the rear and the safety is on safe.  Do not move the safety to fire until the AR is needed to engage a target/theat.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.  From a Cleared Weapon.  The individual issued the AR will use the following procedures: 52 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 A11.4.2.2.1.  Ensure  the  weapon  is  cleared;  the  cover  closed,  bolt  forward  with  the safety on fire.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.2.  Attach the ammunition assault pack to the receiver dovetail underneath the receiver.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.3.  Visually  inspect  the  assault  pack  bandoleer  to  ensure  all  ammunition has the open side of the belt links pointing downward.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.4.  Pull and hold the cocking handle to the rear, locking the bolt to the rear (open) position.  (T-1).  Return the cocking handle to the forward position and place the safety to the safe position.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.5.  Open  the  cover  and  visually  inspect  the  cover,  feed  tray,  chamber, receiver  and  magazine  well  (insert  two  fingers)  to  ensure  no  ammunition  or obstruction is present.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.6.  Place  the  ammunition  belt  onto  the  feed  tray  with  the  belt  links  open side  pointing  downward.    (T-1).    Place  the  lead  link  tab  or  first  round  into  the  feed tray groove against the cartridge stop.  (T-1). A11.4.2.2.7.  Close the cover.  (T-1).  The AR is now fully loaded.  If accomplished correctly,  the  lead-link  tab  is  visible  on  the  right  side  of  the  AR,  flush  against  the ejection  port.  Do not  move the safety to  the  fire position until  the AR is needed to engage a target/threat. A11.4.2.2.8.  The  full-load  can  also  be  achieved  with  the  30-round,  M16-style magazine.    The  bolt  is  rearward  the  safety  is  on  safe,  the  cover  is  closed  and  the magazine is inserted into the magazine well.  The use of a magazine should be used as a last resort, when MAJCOMs authorize this configuration and belted ammunition is not available or is not suitable for tactical operations. A11.5.  On-Post  Unloading  and  Clearing.  The  MAJCOM/A4S  determines  when  to  unload and/or clear the M249 AR and in what configuration (Half-Load and Full-Load) it is employed.  These procedures are prescribed in local contingency plans or other appropriate installation/unit documents.  Note: If the M249 is in the half-load configuration, it can be transported safely in a vehicle  and  should  only  be  unloaded  on-post  when  the  armed  person  is  relieved  from  post  or duty location.  If the M249 is in the full-load configuration, it is not safe for transport in a vehicle and must be unloaded or placed in the half-load configuration prior to transporting the AR.  (T-1).  It is the responsibility of the armed individual and the posting supervisor (or fire team leader) to  verify the AR contains no ammunition  or is in the half-load configuration prior to  transport.  (T-1).  A11.5.1.  Half-Load.  The individual issued the AR will use the following procedures: A11.5.1.1.  Point the muzzle in a safe direction and open the cover.  (T-1). A11.5.1.2.  Remove  the  ammunition  belt,  and  place  the  belt  back  into  the  assault  pack.  (T-1).  Remove the ammunition assault pack from the receiver dovetail.  (T-1). A11.5.1.3.  After the posting supervisor (or fire team leader) verifies the ammunition belt is removed, close the cover.  (T-1).

(T-1).  AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 55 Attachment 12 M24 SNIPER WEAPON SYSTEM RIFLE ( 7.62MM) A12.1.  General Information.  M24 rifle loading/unloading procedures are IAW TO 11W3-5-4-10-1, Operator Manual,  7.62MM M24 Sniper  Weapon System.  The M24 is  assigned to  an Air Force Sharpshooter or Advanced Designated Marksman (ADM).  Normally, each rifle is zeroed to the assigned marksman or a team of two marksmen.  The M24 should not be used as a general issue  weapon.    The  entire  system  consists  of  the  rifle,  optics,  cleaning  kit,  cases,  operator’s manual and other directed support equipment. A12.2.  Storage.  The M24 SWS rifle should be stored in a sealed or locked case.  This helps to prevent  movement/damage  to  the  sighting  device  and  subsequent  changes  in  the  zero  of  the optics.    If  the  case  is  sealed,  the  seal  is  a  railroad-type,  numbered  seal.    The  unit  commander determines who is authorized to remove and replace seals and under what circumstances.  If the case is locked, the unit commander determines key control procedures. A12.2.1.  Prior to placing the rifle in its storage case, the weapon must be cleared and the bolt removed.  (T-1).  The bolt is stored in the rifle case. A12.2.2.  Access to the rifle must be strictly controlled.  Once the Sharpshooter or Advanced Designated Marksman (ADM) has sighted  and zeroed the weapon, they  should be the only individuals handling the weapon for training and/or operational use. A12.2.3.  If  the  rifle  is  not  stored  in  a  case,  armory  personnel  should  take  great  care  in protecting the sighting system from damage or from being disturbed during daily operations.  The unit commander determines how the rifle is stored (in a case or weapons rack). A12.3.  Ammunition.  The  M24  can  be  utilized  to  fire  long-range  ball,  ball/tracer  and  armor piercing (AP) ammunition.  Long-range ammunition is produced to stringent tolerances to ensure superior accuracy.  AP ammunition enables sharpshooters to penetrate hard cover, such as urban terrain and light armor. A12.3.1.  Ammunition  may  be  stored  in  the  sealed  or  locked  case  with  the  M24  to accommodate  quick  response;  however,  the  unit  must  maintain  required  accountability  and security of both the rifle and munitions.  (T-1). A12.3.2.  If  ammunition  is  stored  in  the  rifle  case,  an  armorer  will  verify  the  type,  amount and  lot  number(s)  prior  to  the  case  being  locked  or  sealed.    (T-1).    To  accommodate accountability, ammunition amount and type should be annotated on the seal log. A12.4.  Issue.  The armorer will use the following procedures when issuing the M24 rifle: A12.4.1.  Remove the rifle from its storage rack/case and proceed to the issue-point clearing area with it in the “port-arms” position, bolt in the forward (closed) position (if rifle is stored with  the  bolt  in  the  weapon),  and  the  safety  in  the  fire  (F)  position.    (T-1).    Do  not  place fingers into trigger guard. A12.4.2.  Place  the  muzzle  in  the  clearing  barrel  aiming  point  in  line  with  the  axis  of  the barrel, unlock and retract bolt handle fully to the rear.  (T-1).  If the rifle is stored in a case, with  the  bolt  removed,  inspect  the  chamber  and  magazine  area  to  ensure  no  ammunition  is present, insert the bolt assembly and retract the bolt handle fully to the rear.  (T-1). 56 AFMAN31-129  29 JUNE 2016 A12.4.3.  Place the safety to the safe (S) position, inspect the chamber and magazine area to ensure no ammunition is present.  (T-1). A12.4.4.  Issue the rifle to the individual “butt” first, muzzle elevated, bolt to the rear (open) position  and  safety  in  the  safe  (S)  position.    (T-1).    Do  not  place  fingers  on  trigger  or  into trigger guard during issue. NOTE: If the unit commander has designated storage of the M24 in  a  locked/sealed  case,  the  armorer  may  issue  the  rifle  and  ammunition  to  the  designated marksman in the case to expedite issue for urgent/critical responses.  This procedure may not be used for non-emergency/routine issue of the rifle.  The unit commander will designate in a local  operating  instruction  if  this  option  will  be  used,  including  details  on  specific procedures.  (T-1). A12.5.  Loading/Clearing  Upon  Issue.
