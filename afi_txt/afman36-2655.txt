General Information.  This alternate version of Table III to the Rifle/Carbine Air Force Qualification Course (AFQC) is intended to provide units that are unable to conduct the standard Table III with ball ammunition due to host nation limitations, mandatory quiet hours, range limitations or other limiting factors, with a method to accomplish required qualification training and meet mission requirements.  It is not intended to be a standard option and each unit must provide adequate justification for using this table in lieu of the standard Table III (T-1).  The Security Forces/Combat Arms organizational commander must request and receive approval from AFSFC/FGWL, through the MAJCOM/A4S, to be authorized to use this alternate table of fire (T-1).  Air Reserve Component (ARC) units request approval from the MAJCOM/A4S or National Guard Bureau (NGB) A4S (T-1).  The AFSFC or MAJCOM cannot make blanket approvals to allow multiple bases to use this table and each base request must be evaluated individually, based on their justification (T-1).  This table of fire uses the close combat mission capability kit (CCMCK) and dye-marking cartridges to allow Combat Arms to conduct the training without a conventional small arms range or with limited range capabilities.  Combat Arms must follow the guidance in the HQ USAF/A4SX Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) Training Concept of Operations (CONOPS), along with Air Force Technical Order (TO) 11W2-9-4-11, Technical Manual Operator’s Manual for Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) when conducting training using this table of fire (T-1).  Note: Pay particular attention to the limited safety equipment needed when firing at paper (non-human) targets specified in the CONOPS.  This table cannot be used to zero night vision optics (NVO) and/or laser aiming devices (LAD) for duty use and these items should be zeroed with ball ammunition.  Units should have students complete Table III, Phase III, Orders 1, 2 and 3 using ball ammunition after they complete Phase II of Table I of the Rifle/Carbine AFQC and then use an adjusted aiming point for conducting Table III with dye-marking cartridges.  Another option is for Combat Arms to have dedicated training weapons with NVOs and LADs mounted and zeroed with dye-marking cartridges and have students zero their assigned weapon and night aiming devices with ball ammunition when they complete Tables I and II of the AFQC.  To protect the image intensifier, Combat Arms personnel ensure students use the objective lens cap during daylight use of the NVOs.  Other than the changes discussed above and changes to Table III included in this attachment, all other requirements for the Rifle/Carbine AFQC remain unchanged. A2.2. Documentation.  When Combat Arms receives approval and uses this alternate Table III, they must use the Alternate Table III course in SFMIS and enter the expiration date as the same expiration date as the Rifle/Carbine AFQC Tables I and III (T-1).  Additionally, Combat Arms must enter “Completed Alternate Table III IAW AFSFC (MAJCOM or ANG for ARC units) memo dated DD Mon YY” in the remarks section of the AF Form 522, citing the date on the memo approving use of the alternate table (T-1).

Evaluation Standards:   A2.3.1.2. Phase I - Night M68 CCO/DOS Training and Evaluation: Qualified; six hits anywhere on the Military “E” target.      A2.3.1.3. Phase II - Weapon Mounted Light Training and Evaluation: Qualified; six hits anywhere on the Military “E” target.    A2.3.1.4. Phase III - Night Vision Optics and Laser Aiming Devices Training and Evaluation: For orders 1, 2 and 3, the shooter must achieve a 4cm, 3-shot group within the designated offset impact zone.  NOTE:  Orders 1, 2 and 3, will be conducted during Table I and Table II using ball ammunition for operational weapons and aiming devices.  Order 4 is practice only and hits during this order do not count toward qualification.  On Order 5, shooters must achieve six hits anywhere on the Military “E” target.   A2.3.1.5. Phase IV - Night Scope Teaching and Evaluation: Qualified; four hits anywhere on the Z target.   A2.3.2. Course Notes Rifle/Carbine AFQC Alternate Table III: Night Threat Engagement Techniques.  A2.3.2.1. The purpose of this table is to train and evaluate students on the skills needed to effectively engage threats in limited or zero visibility environments.  All Phases and orders of fire begin in the low ready position with the exception of Phase III: Night Vision Optics and                                                                             Laser Aiming Devices Zero (Orders 1-3) and Phase IV: Night Scope Teaching and Evaluation (Orders 1 and 2).  Students execute “Cover and Sweep” at the end of all orders or strings of fire.  Failure to do so will result in forfeiture of the rounds fired.  Note: Students do not grip the magazine well when firing the weapon as this decreases control during firing and increases the likelihood of a shooter-induced stoppage.  All Table III firing with the exception of, Phase III: Night Vision Optics and Laser Aiming Devices Zero (Orders 1-3), is conducted utilizing the dye-marking round with the Military “E” targets positioned at the 15-meter target line.       A2.3.2.2. Phase I - Night M68 CCO/DOS Training and Evaluation:     A2.3.2.2.1. Orders 1 and 2 - M68 CCO/DOS Training and Evaluation:     A2.3.2.2.1.1. These orders of fire train students on techniques to successfully engage threats during night or in limited visibility using the M68 CCO, DOS or iron sights (pointing technique).   A2.3.2.2.1.2. If not conducting firing under natural lighting conditions, lights are dimmed but not totally out, as shooters need to be able to identify their targets.  Instructors also have to be able to observe the actions of the shooters on the firing line (T-1).  Consideration needs to be given to allow dimmable lights if firing is conducted on a range to produce the desired results.  A2.3.2.2.2. Order 1 - Training/Practice:  A2.3.2.2.2.1. Shooters begin with a 2-round magazine in the weapon and five, 2-round magazines in their ammo pouches.  On the command, “LOAD!” shooters ensure the selector is on “Safe” release the bolt and insert a 2-round magazine.  On the command, “MAKE READY!” shooters charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is indexed outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position.  A2.3.2.2.2.2. On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” shooters engage the Military “E” target with two rounds from the standing position.  Once the two rounds have been expended and the magazine is empty, shooters immediately kneel, conduct a reload and reengage the Military “E” target from the high kneeling position with two rounds.  Shooters have a time limit of 15-seconds per string.  The tower operator has shooters repeat this for two more strings of fire.  Students execute a reload every time the weapon is empty.  A2.3.2.2.2.3. After completion of this order of fire, students clear and ground their weapons, instructors make the line safe and analyze/mark targets.  A2.3.2.2.3. Order 2 - Evaluation:  2.3.2.2.3.1. This is the evaluation order of fire.  Shooters begin with a 4-round magazine in the weapon and a 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command, “LOAD!” shooters ensure the selector is on “Safe” release the bolt and insert a 4-round magazine.  On the command, “MAKE READY!” shooters charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is indexed outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume                                                                                                                                                                                    the low ready position.   A2.3.2.2.3.2. On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” shooters engage the Military “E” target with four rounds from the standing position.  Once the four rounds have been expended and the magazine is empty, shooters immediately kneel, conduct a reload and reengage the Military “E” target from the high kneeling position with four rounds.  Shooters have a time limit of 15-seconds for this order.    A2.3.2.2.3.3. When all firing is complete, instructors make the line safe and mark/score targets.    A2.3.2.3. Phase II - Weapon Mounted Light Training and Evaluation:      A2.3.2.3.1. Orders 1 and 2 - Weapon Mounted Light Training and Evaluation:   A2.3.2.3.1.1. This phase of fire teaches students to rapidly engage threats utilizing the weapon mounted light.    A2.3.2.3.1.2. If conducting firing on a range, all down range lights should be turned off (not dimmed) as shooters need to be able to identify downrange targets using only the weapon mounted light.  However, instructors need to be able to observe the actions of the shooters on the firing line (T-1).  Combat Arms needs to consider using dimmable lights on the firing platform (or over firing positions) to allow observation of shooters or the use of night vision devices by instructors for this purpose.  A2.3.2.3.1.3. Instructors remind shooters the M68 dot intensity should be adjusted to prevent the light from obscuring visibility of the dot.  A2.3.2.3.2. Order 1 - Training/Practice:    A2.3.2.3.2.1. This order is for teaching and practice.  Instructors demonstrate and allow the students to practice the techniques prior to live fire.      A2.3.2.3.2.2. Shooters begin with a 6-round magazine in the weapon and 6-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command, “LOAD!” shooters ensure the selector is on “Safe” release the bolt and insert a 6-round magazine.  On the command, “MAKE READY!” shooters charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is indexed outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position.  A2.3.2.3.2.3. On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” shooters raise the weapon, momentarily activate the light (strobe) and engage the Military “E” target with a controlled pair within the 15-second time limit.  When six rounds have been expended and the magazine is empty, shooters automatically reload with a 6-round magazine from the pouch (shooters do not fire after reloading until the next string of fire).  Under the direction and commands of the tower operator, shooters repeat this order for six strings of fire.  When all firing is complete, instructors make the firing line safe and mark/analyze targets.                                                                                                                                                                                 A2.3.2.3.3. Order 2 - Evaluation:  A2.3.2.3.3.1. This is an evaluation order of fire.  Shooters begin with a 4-round magazine in the weapon and a 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command, “LOAD!” shooters ensure the selector is on “Safe” release the bolt and insert a 4-round magazine.  On the command, “MAKE READY!” shooters charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is indexed outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position.   A2.3.2.3.3.2. On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” shooters raise the weapon, momentarily activate the light (strobe) and engage the Military “E” target with four rounds.  Once the four rounds are expended and the magazine is empty, shooters automatically reload with a 4-round magazine and reengage the Military “E” target.  Shooters have a time limit of 15-seconds for this order.     A2.3.2.3.3.3. When all firing is complete, instructors make the firing line safe and mark/score targets.    A2.3.2.4. Phase III - Night Vision Optics/Laser Aiming Devices Training and Evaluation:  A2.3.2.4.1. This phase of fire teaches students to rapidly engage threats utilizing night vision optics in conjunction with laser aiming devices.  Combat Arms will only allow the use of laser aiming devices that have been certified safe to use by the USAF Laser System Safety Review Board and that are identified as approved for the user on the AFSFC/FGWL USAF Authorized Small Arms/Light weapons (SA/LW) Accessories Listing available on the USAF Combat Arms, Air Force Network (AFNet), Enterprise Information Services (EIS) website (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/) (T-1).  A2.3.2.4.2. Orders 1, 2, and 3, Laser Aiming Device Zero (These orders are to be conducted during Table I, Basic Marksmanship):  A2.3.2.4.2.1. These orders are for zero and practice.  Students are given 10 rounds to zero their individually issued laser-aiming device.  Shooters also use an approved issued night vision device, such as the AN/PVS-7 Night Vision Goggle.  Shooters use only approved laser aiming devices identified on the USAF Authorized Small Arms/Light weapons (SA/LW) Accessories Listing.  Instructors have students use zeroing procedures found in the applicable training manual for the laser-aiming device.  Zero is considered complete when shooters can achieve a 4cm, 3 round shot group within the required impact zone on the target.  WARNING: Treat all lasers as a loaded weapon!  Lasers are used in momentary mode only.  Instructors verify all lasers are off prior to anyone moving forward of the weapons (i.e., down range to mark hits and analyze targets).  This is to prevent anyone from being injured by an active laser.  A2.3.2.4.2.2. Students complete the appropriate orders of fire dependent on device(s) they are issued or with which they will deploy.  The AN/PVS-14 or AN/PVS-7 can be used in the helmet mounted, head harness mounted or weapon mounted (PVS-14) configuration.  It is imperative                                                                                                     that shooters fire these orders using the configuration consistent with their method of employment.  A2.3.2.4.3. Order 4 - Laser Aiming Device Training/Practice:  A2.3.2.4.3.1. This order of fire teaches students to effectively engage threats using night vision/aiming devices.  Students load with dye-marking rounds.  Shooters begin with a 12-round magazine in the weapon.  A2.3.2.4.3.2. On the command, “LOAD!” shooters ensure the selector is on “Safe” release the bolt and insert a 12-round magazine.  On the command, “MAKE READY!” shooters charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is indexed outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position.  A2.3.2.4.3.3. On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” shooters raise the weapon, momentarily activate the laser and engage the Military “E” target with a controlled pair within the 6-second time limit.  Under the direction and commands of the tower operator, shooters repeat this for a total of six, two shot strings.  When all firing is complete, instructors make the firing line safe and mark/analyze targets.  A2.3.2.4.4. Order 5 - Laser Aiming Device Evaluation:  A2.3.2.4.4.1. This order of fire evaluates the student’s ability to effectively engage threats with night vision/laser aiming devices.  Shooters begin with a 4-round magazine in the weapon and a 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command, “LOAD!” shooters ensure the selector is on “Safe” release the bolt and insert a 4-round magazine.  On the command, “MAKE READY!” shooters charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is indexed outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position.  A2.3.2.4.4.2. On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” shooters raise the weapon, momentarily activate the laser and engage the Military “E” target with four rounds.  Once the four rounds have been expended and the magazine is empty shooters automatically reload with a 4-round magazine and reengage the Military “E” target.  Shooters have a 16-second time limit for this order.  When all firing is complete, instructors make the firing line safe and mark/score targets.  A2.3.2.5. Phase IV - Night Scope Training and Evaluation:  A2.3.2.5.1. This phase of fire teaches students to engage threats using an approved night scope.  Shooters fire this phase from the prone supported position.  On the command, “LOAD!” shooters close the bolt and insert the magazine.   A2.3.2.5.2. Order 1 - Night Scope Training/Practice: Students begin with a 5-round magazine.  On the command, “CONTACT FRONT!” students engage the 15-meter “Z” target with five rounds within the 30-second time limit.

Overview. 1.1.1.  This manual contains the qualification training programs required to provide Air Force personnel  the  minimum  training  and  evaluation  necessary  to  employ  small  arms  and  light weapons (SA/LW).  Air Force Instruction (AFI) 36-2654, Combat Arms Program, provides the  policies  and  procedures  for  conducting  the  overall  Air  Force  SA/LW  qualification training  program.    Unless  specified  otherwise  in  AFI  36-2654  or  the  applicable  chapter  of this manual, certified Air Force Combat Arms personnel must conduct all qualification and orientation training.  (T-1).  Other than blank fire or dye-marking cartridge training events, as outlined in AFI 36-2654, Air Force personnel are not authorized to participate in any SA/LW live-fire training until they have successfully completed the applicable training course in this manual, conducted by Air Force Combat Arms personnel.  (T-1).  The specific requirements for SA/LW qualification training are contained in AFI 36-2654. 1.1.2.  Unless specifically exempted from any portion of the training included in this manual as  authorized  in  AFI  36-2654  or  in  this  manual,  personnel  must  meet  all  objectives  and successfully complete all tables, phases and orders of fire in the live-fire course, including all practice phases, to meet the minimum qualification standards.  (T-1).  The practice phases of the courses are not optional. 1.1.3.  Other than those areas specified in each training program or in AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms  may not  modify  any of the training  programs or  courses  of fire in this manual.  This includes  items  such  as  training  objectives,  firing  positions,  time  limits,  target  types,  target distances, magazine loads, etc.   (T-1).  Combat Arms will only use the Air Force approved lesson plans maintained on the USAF Combat Arms, Air Force Network (AFNet), Enterprise Information  Services  (EIS)  website  (https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/AF-ED-00-29/)  to  conduct all training programs in this manual.  (T-1). 1.1.4.  Unless specified in the training program in this manual or in AFI 36-2654, individuals must complete a separate qualification session for different models/types of weapons.  (T-1).  As  an  example,  if  an  individual  qualifies  on  the  Handgun  Air  Force  Qualification  Course (AFQC)  with  the  M9  pistol,  they  are  not  qualified  to  carry  the  M11  pistol  and  must successfully complete the Handgun AFQC  with  the M11.  If they have a requirement for a different  model  weapon,  they  must  complete  the  qualification  training  program  with  that model weapon. 1.2.  Documentation of Training.  Combat Arms will enter all SA/LW qualification training in the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS), as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  (T-1).  The SFMIS is the sole source of Air Force SA/LW qualification training records. 1.3.  Waiver  Approval  Authority.

Rifle/Carbine  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the  minimum training,  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship  skills  and performance  evaluations  required  for  qualification  with  M16  series  rifles/carbines  (M16, M16A1, M16A2, M4, M4A1, etc.) and other rifles/carbines as determined by HQ USAF/A4SX and  AFSFC/FGWL.    The  AFQC  is  a  broad  course  beginning  with  basic  marksmanship  and progressing through short-range marksmanship and limited visibility firing.  Group B personnel will  complete  Table  I,  Basic  Rifle  Marksmanship  (BRM)  and  Table  II,  Short-Range  Combat (SRC)  training.    (T-1).    In  addition  to  BRM  and  SRC,  designated  Group  A  personnel  must complete  additional  tables/phases  based  on  the  equipment  they  are  issued.    (T-1).    As  a minimum, all designated Group A personnel must complete Table III, Phase I, Night CCO/DOS Training  and  Evaluation,  using  iron  sights  or  backup  iron  sights  if  they  are  not  equipped  with other sights.  (T-1).  Refer to AFI 36-2654 and AFI 31-117 for information on Air Force arming groups.  Qualification and Expert marksman standards are the same for all personnel regardless of  arming  group.    Note:    Any  personnel,  regardless  of  arming  group,  who  are  authorized  and equipped with night aiming or night scope devices (AN/PEQ-2A, AN/PEQ-15, M3X, etc.) must successfully complete academic instruction and the applicable phases of Table III, Night Threat Engagement Techniques, before they are allowed to use the equipment.  (T-1). 2.2.  Training Overview. 2.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student's  first  participation  in  the  rifle/carbine qualification-training  program.    Initial  training  consists  of  in-depth  classroom  instruction, qualification  on  the  AFQC  and  passing  all  training  objectives  in  Table  2.1    Group  A personnel  may  not  bypass  classroom  training  as  outlined  in  paragraph  2.2.2.1.  for  initial training and must complete all required tables/phases for their career field or function to be qualified.  (T-1).  Additionally, Group A personnel may not bypass classroom training until they  have  successfully  completed  all  objectives  in  the  course  during  initial  training, regardless of any previous qualifications.  (T-1). 2.2.2.  Recurring Training.  This is qualification training after initial qualification.  It consists of  classroom  instruction  (except  as  exempted  in  paragraph  2.2.2.1.1.),  passing  performance evaluations  and  qualifying  on  the  appropriate  course  of  fire.    The  required  frequencies  for recurring training and qualification are outlined in  AFI  36-2654.  If the complete course  of fire  is  required,  all  tables  and  phases  (including  night  fire)  should  be  fired  as  a  complete course during the same training session. 2.2.2.1.  Group A Personnel procedures for Academic Bypass: 2.2.2.1.1.  Since  Group  A  personnel  receive  more  frequent  training,  Combat  Arms may  forego  classroom  training  on  the  objectives  listed  in  Table  2.1  for  Group  A personnel  completing  recurring  qualification  training  that  successfully  complete performance  evaluation  on  all  objectives  prior  to  firing.    Combat  Arms  uses  the performance evaluation checklists from Period V, Performance Evaluation, of the HQ USAF/A4SX  approved    Rifle/Carbine  AFQC  Lesson  Plan,  to  evaluate  student performance.    Combat  Arms  is  not  required  to  annotate  the  checklists  or  maintain   14  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 them  as  records.    The  checklists  are  intended  to  formalize  the  evaluation  process, ensure each task is evaluated, and provide a guide for instructors. 2.2.2.1.2.  All  Group  A  personnel  in  the  class  must  successfully  complete  all objectives  without  instructor  or  other  assistance  or  guidance.    (T-1).    On-the-spot corrections  are  not  allowed.    Individuals  who  cannot  meet  the  objectives,  receive classroom  training  and  need  to  successfully  complete  all  objectives  before participating  in  live-fire  training.    Individuals  who  cannot  properly  complete  any objective are removed from the class and provided academic instruction or the entire class is provided academic instruction on the objectives missed by the student(s). 2.2.2.1.3.  Combat Arms instructs and evaluates all other training objectives listed in Table 2.1 that are not included in the performance evaluations. 2.2.2.1.4.  Personnel in Group A only classes may be given performance evaluations prior to  classroom instruction to  determine the appropriate level (objectives  needed) of  classroom  instruction  required.    This  may  be  best  accomplished  on  a  separate training  day  and  the  evaluations  are  valid  for  30  days  or  two  Unit  Training Assemblies (UTA) for Air Reserve Component (ARC) members.  Using this method, Combat  Arms  may  determine  which  Group  A  members  require  classroom  training and schedule them for a class date, while scheduling those who successfully pass the evaluations for a live-fire only training date. 2.2.2.1.5.  The  performance  evaluation  checklists  from  Period  V,  Performance Evaluation, of the Rifle/Carbine AFQC lesson plan are not intended or required to be used in normal initial or recurring training classes (where students receive academic instruction).  Combat Arms uses the standard demonstration/performance method of instruction for these classes and evaluates students with the aid of assistant instructors during academic training.  Students must be able to perform all objectives required in Table 2.1  (T-1), but instructors are not required to perform one-on-one performance evaluations using the lesson plan checklists. 2.2.3.  Qualifying  Individuals  on  M16  Series  Rifles/Carbines.    Combat  Arms  will  use  the following  procedures  for  rifle/carbine  qualification  for  all  students  with  a  rifle  or  carbine requirement:  (T-1). 2.2.3.1.  Provide mechanical training on the M4 (or M4A1 as authorized) and M16A2. 2.2.3.2.  Have  the  student  complete  live-fire  with  the  M4  using  both  the  iron sights/backup iron sights (BUIS) and the Close Combat Optic (CCO) sight. 2.2.3.3.  Enter, “Individual completed all required training and is qualified on the M4 and the  M16A2”  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  522,  USAF  Ground  Weapons Training  Data.    This  method  allows  the  individual  to  be  armed  with  any  of  the  three versions of the rifle/carbine. 2.2.3.4.  Ensure  individuals  who  deploy  with  a  weapon  other  than  the  one  they  use  for qualification  complete  live-fire  zeroing  of  all  sights/optics/aiming  devices  on  the  actual weapon  with  which  they  are  deploying.    This  also  applies  to  weapons  issued  for  in-garrison arming.  For example, if an individual is tasked to deploy with an M16A2 rifle, they complete training as outlined above and live-fire with the M4.  At the completion of AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   15  qualification,  they  zero  the  sights/aiming  devices  on  the  M16A2  they  are  taking  with them on the deployment. 2.2.3.5.  In  circumstances  where  neither  Combat  Arms  nor  units  have  M4  carbines available for training, AFSFC/FGWL may approve training on the M16A2 only.  This is by  exception  only.    The  standard  is  for  all  personnel  with  a  rifle/carbine  arming requirement  (in-garrison  or  deployed)  to  receive  qualification  training  on  the  two variations  of  the  weapon,  as  outlined  in  paragraph  2.2.3.3.    This  provides  commanders with flexibility in meeting arming needs, especially when they are faced with shortages of specific models of M16 series weapons. 2.2.3.6.  When individuals are currently qualified on only one M16 series weapon (M4 or M16A2)  and  become  required  to  arm  with  a  different  model,  Combat  Arms  uses  the following procedures: 2.2.3.6.1.  For  individuals  currently  qualified  on  the  M16A2  only  and  requiring qualification on the M4 (with CCO), provide mechanical training on the differences between the rifle and carbine and live-fire with the M4 on Table I, Phase I, II, IV and V only.  Enter, “Individual completed all required training and is qualified on the M4 and  the  M16A2”  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form  522.    Use  the  original expiration date. 2.2.3.6.2.  For  individuals  currently  qualified  on  the  M4  (using  the  CCO)  only  and requiring qualification on the M16A2, provide mechanical training on the differences between  the  rifle  and  carbine  only.    Live-fire  is  not  required  except  for  zeroing  the sights/aiming  devices  on  the  assigned  weapon  or  weapon  taken  on  deployment.  Enter, “Individual completed all required training and is qualified on the M4 and the M16A2” in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Use the original expiration date. 2.2.4.  If AFSFC/FGWL (MAJCOM/A4S for ARC units) has waived the requirement for the night  fire  portions  of  the  course  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654,  Combat  Arms  still  completes academic  training,  performance  evaluations  and  conducts  dry-fire  on  these  skills/objectives using all night vision and aiming equipment students may have issued to them. 2.2.5.  Designated Marksman (DM) personnel fire the entire course of fire using the current AFSFC approved Day Optic  Sight (DOS),  such  as  the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG).  They complete qualification training twice per calendar year (CY).  The first time they qualify as a DM each  year, they complete the entire course of fire (Tables I-III).  The second time they qualify each 12 months (5 to 7 months after completion of the full course); they complete live-fire qualification on Table I of the Rifle/Carbine AFQC only.   They are not  required  to  complete  academic  instruction  or  performance  evaluation  for  the  second qualification  training  event.    Additionally,  DM  personnel  should  complete  unit  live-fire sustainment  training  during  alternating  quarters  (between  qualification  training)  as  outlined in AFI 36-2654.  They should complete this training on a full distance range if possible, with targets out to ranges of 500 meters.  Units should use calendar year (CY) quarters to conduct the DM unit level sustainment training and recurring qualification cycle.  For example, if the member  completes  initial  qualification  in  Feb  15  (first  quarter  of  CY)  they  complete sustainment training by 30 Jun 15 (end of second quarter of CY).  The next CY quarter they complete  recurring  qualification.    In  this  example,  recurring  qualification  is  completed  no later  than  30  Sep  15.    This  cycle  continues,  alternating  between  sustainment  training  and   16  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 recurring qualification each CY quarter.  Following is an example of the cycle for a member who completed initial DM AFQC qualification on 17 Apr 15: 2.2.5.1.  Sustainment training by 30 Sep 15. 2.2.5.2.  Recurring qualification due by 31 Dec 15 (regardless of sustainment training). 2.2.5.3.  Sustainment training by 31 Mar 16. 2.2.5.4.  Recurring  qualification  due  by  30  Apr  16  (qualification  cannot  exceed  12 months). 2.2.5.5.  This  quarterly  cycle,  alternating  between  sustainment  training  and  recurring qualification, continues until a DM arming requirement no longer exists. 2.2.5.6.  Combat Arms enters “Designated Marksman” and the model of the DOS used by the student in the remarks section of the AF Form 522. 2.2.6.  Individuals authorized and equipped with the AFSFC approved DOS, other than DM, will fire the entire course of fire using the DOS and follow the same course guidance as DM.  (T-1).    Non-DM  personnel  equipped  with  the  DOS  are  only  required  to  qualify  at  the frequencies specified in AFI 36-2654 for their arming group (e.g., once every 12 months for Group  A).    Combat  Arms  enters  the  model  of  the  DOS  used  by  the  student  in  the  remarks section of the AF Form 522. 2.2.7.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial  training.    For  remedial  training,  Combat  Arms  may  provide  training  and  live-fire evaluation on only the phases of the course the individual did not successfully complete, as long  as  remedial  training  is  completed  within  30  days  (ARC  members  have  two  UTAs  to meet  this  requirement).    If  more  than  30  days  (two  UTAs  for  ARC)  have  passed  since  the original class date, the individual re-accomplishes the entire training program, including live-fire on all required tables and phases. 2.2.8.  Unit-Level Sustainment Training.  This is refresher training and may include live-fire if the unit has proficiency ammunition authorized by the Global Ammunition Control Point's (GACP),  Ground  Munitions  Authorization  Tables  (GMAT)  or  it  may  simply  consist  of knowledge  and  operator  skills  training  for  those  without  ammunition  authorized.    Specific guidance for live-fire training, including mandatory sustainment training, is contained in AFI 36-2654.  This training is provided by unit personnel who are qualified on the weapon(s) to help individuals retain skills. 2.2.9.  Orientation  Training.    During  Basic  Military  Training,  enlisted  AF  members  do  not complete  training  on  objectives  1.4.,  1.5.,  2.6.,  2.7.,  2.8.,  2.9.,  4.3.  and  4.5.  in  Table  2.1.  They receive training on all other objectives and complete live-fire on Table I, Phase I - Iron Sight/BUIS/DOS  Grouping  and  Zero  (using  iron  sights  only),  Phase  IV  -  Basic  Rifle Marksmanship Training/Practice and Phase V - Basic Rifle Marksmanship Evaluation from the  AFQC  in  Table  2.1.    Individuals  who  achieve  the  required  score  for  “Expert”  earn  the Air  Force  Small  Arms  Expert  Marksmanship  Ribbon.    This  guidance  also  applies  to  rifle orientation  training  conducted  for  US  Air  Force  Academy  (USAFA)  Cadets  and  Reserve Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  officer  accessions.    This  training  does  not  meet  the AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   17  requirements  for  arming  or  deployment;  however,  it  does  meet  the  minimum  training requirements  for  follow-on  training,  such  as  at  technical  training  schools.    Individuals  who require  arming  in-garrison  or  who  are  deploying  to  a  hostile  fire  area  where  they  have  an arming requirement must complete the entire course and meet all training objectives.  (T-1). 2.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 2.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 2.3.2.  Range.    Firing  line  officials  (block  officers)  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as needed  during  grouping,  zeroing  and  practice.    Each  firing  point  instructor  enforces adherence to the course of fire requirements, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.    When  students  are  completing  evaluation  phases,  instructors  do  not  coach  or  assist them  and  only  enforce  course  of  fire  requirements  and  safe  weapons  handling  procedures.  To  ensure  safe  range  operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  tower operator and all firing line officials.  See AFI 36-2654 for instructor requirements and student to  instructor  ratios.    Note:    Due  to  the  limited movement  in  Table  II,  Short-Range  Combat (SRC)  Training,  the  instructor  to  student  ratio  of  one  instructor  per  student  during  any training  involving  student  movement  with  loaded  weapons  does  not  apply.    Combat  Arms may use the standard minimum instructor to student ratio of one instructor per seven students during  all  semi-automatic  phases/orders  of  fire  in  Table  II.    For  burst  and  night  fire phases/orders  of  fire,  Combat  Arms  uses  the  required  minimum  instructor  to  student  ratio directed by AFI 36-2654. 2.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has the responsibility and authority to ensure safe and effective range operations.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 2.4.  Rifle/Carbine Qualification Plan of Instruction.  The plan in the following paragraphs is intended to provide standardized instruction.  This program is mandatory for initial and recurring training.    Students  must  meet  and  be  evaluated  to  the  performance  standards  of  these  training objectives listed in Table 2.1  (T-1).  Approximate training times for this program are: 2.4.1.  Initial and recurring – 7 to 9 hours. 2.4.2.  Remedial – as needed. 2.4.3.  Academic bypass live-fire – 4 to 5 hours. 2.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to employ the rifle/carbine in offensive and defensive roles. 2.6.  Training  Objectives.  Training  objectives  for  successful  completion  of  this  course  are found in Table 2.1 2.6.1.  The objectives in Table 2.1 must be met in order for students to complete the training.  (T-1).  The objectives are listed in sequence as covered in the lesson plan and events that take   18  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 place  throughout  the  training  day.    Students  must  meet  objectives  only  for  the  weapon  and equipment they are issued or with which they will deploy.  (T-1). 2.6.2.  Students must meet objectives 1.1. through 1.24. during classroom instruction.  (T-1).  Students must understand and be able to perform these objectives in class.  (T-1).  Instructors evaluate  the  performance  levels  of  the  class  for  each  objective  before  moving  on  to  other objectives. 2.6.3.  Students  must  meet  objectives  2.1.  through  2.9.  before  being  allowed  to  attend  live-fire training.  (T-1).  If students do not understand or cannot perform these tasks, instructors conduct remedial training until objectives are met. 2.6.4.  Students  must  perform  objectives  3.1.  through  3.4.  on  the  range.    (T-1).    These objectives  are  completed  in  order  for  students  to  move  to  the  qualification  phase  of  this course.  If a student violates safety procedures or cannot perform the task correctly, they are not allowed to participate in live-fire training. 2.6.5.  Students must perform objectives 4.1. through 4.6. without instructor assistance.  (T-1).  If a student cannot perform any one of these objectives correctly, they do not receive a qualifying  score.    Students  must  perform  the  objectives  without  assistance  and  achieve  the required hits on target to be considered qualified.  (T-1). AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   19  Table 2.1.

Course Information, Rifle/Carbine AFQC. 2.11.1.  Targets for the Course: 2.11.1.1.  Target  “Z” is  the M16A2 (National  Stock Number [NSN] 6920-01-167-1392) or  M16A2/M4  25-meter  zero  target  (NSN  6920-01-395-2949  or  NSN  6920-01-482-0098).  In Phase II of Table I, individuals using the M68 zero the optic to hit point of aim, for  accomplishment  of  the  25-meter  reduced  silhouette  portion  of  the  course.    After completing Table I and before starting Table II, students using the M68 turn the elevation adjustment screw clockwise (down) four (4) clicks.  This procedure adds the 1.5cm offset needed for combat zero.  The M68 should remain at this setting for individually assigned or  deploying  weapons.    Instructors  may  direct  students  with  training  weapons  to  return the M68 to the 25m zero setting after firing. 2.11.1.2.  Target Military “E” is the kneeling silhouette target (NSN 6920-00-600-6874) with  a  10-inch  lethal  (chest)  and  a  6-inch  incapacitation  (head)  zone  added.    Before conducting  firing  on  Table  II  of  the  course,  prepare  Military  “E”  silhouette  targets  as follows.  Draw a 10-inch circle in the center of the chest and a 6-inch circle on the center of the head of the target.  Locate the circles on the Military “E” target as shown in Figure 2.1  Center the 10-inch circle on the target with the top edge of the circle 13-1/4 inches from the top of the head of the target and center the 6-inch circle in the head of the target with  the  top  of  the  circle  3  inches  below  the  top  of  the  target.    To  simplify  marking targets, Combat Arms may create a template using plywood, plastic, cardboard or other material.  Table II, Phase II, orders 4 and 5, as well as Table II, Phase IV, orders 1 and 2, AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   33  requires  two  Military  “E”  silhouette  targets  with  the  circles  drawn  as  outlined  in  this paragraph.

Target “SF” is the 25-meter scaled silhouette, slow fire target (NSN 6920-01-167-1391). 2.11.1.4.  Targets required for each phase and order of the course are identified in Table 2.2 2.11.2.  Evaluation Standards: 2.11.2.1.  All  personnel,  regardless  of  arming  category,  must  satisfactorily  complete  the applicable phases and orders in Tables I and II of the AFQC to meet minimum training requirements for arming.  (T-1).  Scoring requirements (number of hits) are the same for all arming groups.  Note:  A hit on a target or specific location on a target is defined as the  hole  created  by  the  projectile  as  it  passes  through  the  target.    If  any  portion  of  the bullet hole is within the scoreable area of the target (e.g., bullet hole touching outer edge of target silhouette), it is counted as a hit, unless the scoring standard specifies that the hit must be “inside” the scoreable area.  In  this case, the entire circumference of the bullet hole is inside the scoreable area and not touching the edge. 2.11.2.1.1.  Table  I,  Phase  II,  M68  CCO/DOS  25M  BRM  Zero  is  not  required  for individuals who only complete qualification training on the M16A2 without the CCO. 2.11.2.1.2.  Table  II,  Phase  I,  Transition  to  Handgun  Immediate  Action,  is  only required  for  Group  A  personnel  who  will  be  armed  with  both  the  handgun  and rifle/carbine at the same time.  (T-1).  Note:  Students must be currently qualified on the handgun to participate in live-fire training on this phase.  (T-1). 2.11.2.2.  Group A individuals belonging to the career fields, organizations or functional areas  identified  on  the  USAF  Arming  Group  A  Functions/Agencies  listing  as  requiring qualification on Table III must satisfactorily complete the applicable phases and orders in Table  III  of  the  AFQC  in  addition  to  Tables  I  and  II  to  meet  minimum  training requirements for arming.  (T-1).  These personnel are referred to as Designated Group A.  All  Designated  Group  A  personnel  must  complete  Table  III,  Phase  I,  regardless  of whether they use any other night aiming equipment.  Note:  Any personnel, regardless of arming group, who are authorized and equipped with night aiming or night scope devices (AN/PEQ-2A,  AN/PEQ-15,  M3X,  etc.)  must  satisfactorily  complete  the  applicable phases/orders  of  Table  III  for  the  authorized  items  before  they  are  allowed  to  use  the equipment  and  the  guidance  in  paragraphs  2.11.2.2.1.  and  2.11.2.2.2.  applies  to  these personnel as well.  (T-2).   34  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 2.11.2.2.1.  Personnel  only  fire  phases  in  Table  III  for  equipment  they  are  issued  or with  which  they  deploy.    For  example,  personnel  who  are  not  issued  or  deploying with  the  AN/PVS-14  would  not  fire  phases  for  that  particular  piece  of  equipment.  The intent is for personnel to be knowledgeable and qualified on equipment they use.  Combat  Arms  should  not  provide  night  vision  devices.    Personnel  must  report  to training with night vision devices they are issued or with which they deploy.  (T-2). 2.11.2.2.2.  If AFSFC/FGWL (MAJCOM/A4S for ARC units) has approved a waiver to the night fire portion of the course (Table III) as outlined in AFI 36-2654, Combat Arms  must  still  conduct  academic,  performance  evaluation  and  dry-fire  training  on the applicable phases of Table III.  (T-1). 2.11.2.3.  To  qualify  on  the  course,  personnel  must  demonstrate  safe  weapon  handling skills,  the  ability  to  operate  the  weapon  unassisted,  proper  movement  and  use  of  cover, proper threat engagement techniques, achieve the minimum number of hits on the target and  properly  perform  operator  maintenance.    (T-1).    Individuals  achieve  a  qualifying score by attaining the minimum number of hits on the correct targets and performing the proper  operation/technique  during  each  phase  they  fire.    If  personnel  do  not  score  the minimum number of required hits on any phase, they are unqualified and Combat Arms follows the guidance in AFI 36-2654 for same day refires or remedial training. 2.11.2.4.  To  qualify  as  “Expert,”  personnel  must  demonstrate  a  high  level  of  skill  by meeting  all  the  requirements  for  qualification  and  additionally  achieve  the  minimum number of hits on the correct targets for each phase of the course.  (T-1).  For example, if a person achieves an expert score on Table I, Basic Rifle Marksmanship, but not on Table II,  Short-Range  Combat,  then  they  do  not  earn  an  “Expert”  rating  and  their  record indicates “Qualified” as their status.  If an individual fails to meet the minimum standards for any portion of the course, they do not receive  an “Expert” rating, regardless of their score.  For example, if an individual achieves the minimum required score for expert but cannot properly perform a function check on their weapon or perform immediate action, they do not receive an “Expert” rating. 2.11.2.5.  Minimum Requirements for Qualification and Expert Status: 2.11.2.5.1.  TABLE I - BASIC MARKSMANSHIP. I  – 2.11.2.5.1.1.  Phase Iron  Sight/BUIS/DOS  Grouping  and  Zero Phase:  Students should be able to achieve one 4cm shot group within the circle of the “Z” target and perform their own sight adjustments under the guidance of instructors. 2.11.2.5.1.2.

Phase  I  -  Transition  to  Handgun  Immediate  Action:  Qualified; students  perform  task  safely,  properly  and  effectively  and  should  be  able  to engage the target. II 2.11.2.5.2.2.  Phase Techniques Teaching/Practice:  This  is  a  practice  phase  only  and  hits  do  not  count  toward qualification.    However,  students  should  strive  to  hit  the  required  targets  in  the prescribed time limits, as this prepares them for the evaluation phase. Engagement - Tactical 2.11.2.5.2.3.  Phase III  –  Tactical  Movement  and  Use  of  Cover Teaching/Practice:  This  is  a  practice  phase  only  and  hits  do  not  count  toward qualification.    However,  students  should  strive  to  hit  the  required  targets  in  the prescribed time limits, as this prepares them for the evaluation phase. 2.11.2.5.2.4.  Phase IV - Short-Range Combat (SRC) Evaluation: 2.11.2.5.2.4.1.

Bullet holes inside the silhouette or touching the outline of the silhouette count as hits. 2.12.  General Course Guidance Rifle/Carbine AFQC: 2.12.1.  Security  Forces  and  Battlefield  Airmen  fire  the  entire  course  while  wearing  issued ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), gas mask carrier, with gas mask and protective gloves, and handgun holster (for Group A armed with handgun and rifle/carbine simultaneously).  Other personnel qualifying for deployment fire the entire course  wearing  the  ICE  they  will  use  at  the  deployed  location.    All  others  are  highly encouraged to wear ICE during the entire course, which may allow them to meet deployment training  requirements  if  tasked  to  deploy  within  the  required  training  times.    Students  with tactical  slings  (single,  two  or  three-point)  wear  their  slings  when  firing  from  all  positions except during zero and grouping phases. 2.12.2.  During  practice/teaching  phases,  instructors  supervise  students  as  needed  during weapons  handling  procedures  to  include,  safety,  clearing,  loading,  reloading,  charging  and application  of  immediate/remedial  action  procedures.    During  evaluation  phases,  students complete all weapons handling procedures without instructor assistance. 2.12.2.1.  If  an  unsafe  condition  develops  such  as  a  light  recoil  or  failure  to  extract, instructors  will  act  immediately  to  ensure  the  safety  of  all  personnel.    (T-1).    Students who  run  out  of  time  due  to  failures  not  caused  by  improper  weapons  handling  are considered “alibis” and instructors pro-rate time to allow them to complete the string of fire.  Note:  Students will not grip or support the weapon using the magazine while firing the  weapon,  as  this  decreases  control  during  firing  and  increases  the  likelihood  of  a shooter-induced stoppage.  (T-1). 2.12.2.2.  For other types of stoppages, students only receive additional time to complete firing if they properly applied immediate action procedures.  If the student failed to apply immediate  action  or  was  unable  to  perform  immediate  action  properly,  they  do  not receive extra time and their remaining rounds for the order of fire are counted as misses. 2.12.2.3.  The  objective  is  for  students  to  demonstrate  the  ability  to  operate  the  weapon without assistance while instructors maintain a safe training environment. 2.12.3.  Students who commit any safety violations are immediately warned and corrected.  If they continue to violate weapon or range safety rules, they should be promptly removed from the range until they receive remedial training and can demonstrate the ability to consistently apply weapon safety rules.  Students who violate the safety rules in paragraph 1.4.5.2. (and subparagraphs) are not allowed to continue the course until they complete remedial training and pass a performance check. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   37  2.12.4.  To  correct  shooting  errors,  instructors  may  provide  additional  rounds  during  the grouping and zero phases and all teaching/practice orders.  Identify additional rounds on the AF Form 710. 2.12.5.  The purpose of using the 25-meter zeroing (Z) target is three-fold.  First, the student has  a  realistic  combat  distance  target  (300  meters  for  M16A2/M4)  with  a  sight  adjustment grid printed over the silhouette to aid in accurately making sight adjustments.  Secondly, it is an  excellent  training  aid  for  conducting  grouping  exercises.    Finally,  the  target  provides  a good  indication  of  the  student's  ability  to  hit  a  life-size  target  at  expected  distances  from  a steady firing position. 2.12.6.  Students  complete  training/qualification  phases  for  all  optics,  lights  and  night vision/aiming devices they are issued or with which they will deploy. 2.12.7.  It  is  recommended  that  Combat  Arms  allow  only  use  of  sandbags  filled  with  sand, gravel,  wood  chips  or  crushed  bark  when  firing  from  the  prone  supported  position,  as  this provides  greater  realism  in  training.    Avoid  use  of  other  items  such  as  rubber  blocks  or wooden  supports  built  into  the  firing  line  for  this  position,  as  these  items  are  not  typically available in combat or field environments. 2.12.8.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  various  supported  positions  is  to  teach  students  the tactical  advantage  of  using  cover  in  a  combat  situation  and  to  increase  combat  accuracy.  Instructors emphasize the use of cover throughout the course.  Students maximize the use of cover during firing and reloading. 2.12.9.  During  Table  I,  Phase  I  and  Phase  II  as  well  as  all  teaching/practice  phases/orders throughout  the  course,  instructors  check  and  analyze  targets  after  firing.    Instructors  assist students  in  assuming  correct  firing  positions  and  review  shooting  fundamentals  between orders of fire as needed. 2.12.10.  Instructors remind students to keep the tip of the front sight on the vital area (center of the 4cm circle) when engaging the 250-meter and 300-meter targets.  The eye has a natural tendency  to  try  to  see  more  of  the  target  at  those  distances  and  may  cause  the  student  to unconsciously hold the front sight low on those small targets. 2.12.11.  Instructors will not teach during the evaluation orders of fire.  (T-1).  However, they may assist students and teach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders of fire.  They also correct safety infractions and supervise student application of immediate/remedial action procedures when applicable. 2.12.12.  During reloading, students keep the firing hand on the rifle grip or support hand on the  handguards  as  appropriate  depending  on  which  hand  is  being  used  to  withdraw  the magazine.  When withdrawing a magazine from the weak side, students continue to maintain a grip on the rifle grip with the firing hand.  If reloading from a strong side pouch, students may  maintain  their  grip  on  the  handguards  with  the  weak  hand.    The  requirement  is  for students  to  maintain  positive  control  of  the  weapon  when  reloading  from  either  side  of  the body. 2.12.13.  Before  each  order,  place  loaded  magazines  in  the  pouch  with  the  top  end  of  the magazine down and the projectile end or front edge of the magazine pointing away from the body, toward or away from the centerline of the body depending on the type of pouches and   38  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 technique  used  when  withdrawing  the  magazine.    Properly  orienting  magazines  ensures speed and efficiency of reload.  The student only has to unfasten the pouch and remove the magazine during the reload.  This is a critical skill requiring practice to accomplish quickly and smoothly.  It is imperative students practice reloading the rifle/carbine from the pouch.  Students can reload magazines between orders of fire as necessary. 2.12.14.  Eye and hearing protection is used by all personnel on the range. 2.12.15.  WARNING:  Combat  Arms  personnel  must  inspect  all  weapons,  magazines and magazine pouches at the end of training to ensure they do not contain live rounds.  (T-1).  See AFI 36-2654 for additional range operation procedures. 2.12.16.  The silhouettes on the SF targets are engaged as targets within the student's field of fire.    For  example,  if  six  enemy  targets  presented  themselves  at  the  actual  distances represented  on  the  SF  target,  the  closest  (greatest  threat)  targets  would  be  engaged  first, progressing  to  the  farthest  (least  threat)  targets.    In  combat,  students  should  engage  those targets posing the greatest threat first. 2.12.17.  Sights used in Tables I and II. 2.12.17.1.  Designated  Marksman  and  authorized  DOS  users  complete  all  phases  in Tables  I  and  II  that  use  the  Slow  Fire  target  using  the  DOS  or  designated  optic  and  all phases that use the Military “E” target using the DOS iron sights.  If the designated optic does not include built in iron sights, the student can use either the backup iron sights (if possible) or the optic for all phases with the Military “E” target. 2.12.17.2.  Students  complete  the  following  tables,  phases  and  orders  of  fire  with  the prescribed sights: 2.12.17.2.1.  Table I, Phase I - iron sights/backup iron sights or DOS iron sights. 2.12.17.2.2.  Table I, Phase II - close combat optic or DOS only. 2.12.17.2.3.  Table I, Phase III - student may use any sight. 2.12.17.2.4.  Table I, Phase IV - students without optics use iron sights for all orders. 2.12.17.2.4.1.  Order 1 - iron sights/backup iron sights or DOS. 2.12.17.2.4.2.  Order 2 - M68 or DOS. 2.12.17.2.4.3.  Order 3 - iron sights/backup iron sights or DOS. 2.12.17.2.4.4.  Order 4 - M68 or DOS. 2.12.17.2.5.  Table I, Phase V - students without optics use iron sights for all orders. 2.12.17.2.5.1.  Order 1 - iron sights/backup iron sights or DOS. 2.12.17.2.5.2.  Order 2 - M68 or DOS. 2.12.17.2.5.3.  Order 3 - iron sights/backup iron sights or DOS. 2.12.17.2.5.4.  Order 4 - M68 or DOS. 2.12.17.2.6.  Table I, Phase VI - student may use any sight. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   39  2.12.17.2.7.  Table II, Phase I through Phase IV - M68 or DOS iron sights (students without optics use iron sights for all phases/orders).  Optic if no iron sights available. 2.13.  Course Notes Rifle/Carbine AFQC: 2.13.1.  TABLE I:  BASIC RIFLE MARKSMANSHIP. 2.13.1.1.  Phase I - Iron Sight/BUIS/DOS Iron Sight 25M/300M Grouping and Zero. 2.13.1.1.1.  Students fire this phase using iron or back up iron sights only.  Students fire  four  round  shot  groups  with  no  time  limit.    Students  should  achieve  one  four round  shot  group  within  the  4cm  circle  on  the  25-meter  “Z”  target.    Instructors closely  analyze  student  errors  for  students  who  do  not  achieve  a  4cm  shot  group within  the  silhouette  circle.    Additionally,  instructors  should  double-check  the weapon and sights to ensure that they are serviceable and properly mounted. 2.13.1.1.2.  During  all  orders  of  fire,  students  perform  their  own  sight  adjustments.  Instructors  coach  as  necessary  to  assist  students  in  attaining  a  4cm  shot  group somewhere  on  the  target  before  attempting  to  adjust  the  sights.    Instructors  can provide  additional  rounds  for  those  students  who  have  difficulty  until  the  student attains  a  shot  group.    Targets  are  marked  and  analyzed  by  instructors  and  students after each order of fire.  Additional rounds are documented on the AF Form 710. 2.13.1.2.  Phase II - M68 CCO/DOS 25M BRM Grouping and Zero. 2.13.1.2.1.  Students fire this phase using the M68 CCO or DOS that they are issued for  duty.    Students  should  achieve  a  4cm,  four  shot  group  in  the  silhouette  circle.  Instructors  can  provide  additional  rounds  for  those  students  who  have  difficulty.  Targets are marked and analyzed by instructors and students after each string.  During all orders of fire, students perform their own sight adjustments.  Additional rounds are documented on the AF Form 710. 2.13.1.2.2.  Instructors  closely  analyze  shooting  errors  for  students  who  do  not achieve  a  4cm  shot  group  within  the  silhouette  circle.    Additionally,  instructors should double-check the weapon and sight to ensure the weapon/sight is serviceable and properly mounted. 2.13.1.3.  Phase III - Immediate/Remedial Action Techniques. 2.13.1.3.1.  Order 1 - Immediate Action Dry-fire Practice: 2.13.1.3.1.1.  This  order  is  evaluated  as  "Go”  or  “No-Go.”    Students  conduct  a dry-fire  walk-through  of  the  immediate  action  technique  with  5.56mm  dummy rounds  until  they  demonstrate  competency  prior  to  attempting  live-fire.    Note:  Instructors  may  complete  this  evaluation  in  the  classroom.    If  instructors completed the evaluation of immediate action in the classroom, students move on to Order 2. 2.13.1.3.1.2.  Students  start  in  the  prone  position.    On  the  command  “LOAD,” students  release  the  bolt  forward  and  insert  the  magazine.    On  the  command “MAKE READY,” students ensure the selector is on Safe, charge the weapon to chamber a dummy round and assume the prone supported position. 2.13.1.3.1.3.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students attempt to engage   40  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 their  target.    When  a  stoppage  occurs,  students  announce,  "COVER,”  apply immediate  action,  announce  "READY"  and  continue  to  fire  from  the  prone supported position. 2.13.1.3.1.4.  Students repeat this drill for five strings and complete the immediate action  techniques  without  assistance  or  coaching  before  progressing  to  live-fire.  WARNING:  Combat Arms personnel will inspect all dummy rounds prior to use to ensure serviceability.  (T-1).  Combat Arms will not allow the use of dummy rounds with loose projectiles as this could allow a projectile to become lodged in the bore of the weapon.  (T-1).  This could lead to a catastrophic weapon failure, which  could  endanger  personnel!    Combat  Arms  will  not  use  expended  ball ammunition  cases  for  this  phase  of  training,  however  they  may  use  either expended blank ammunition cases or dummy rounds.  (T-1). 2.13.1.3.2.  Order 2 - Immediate Action Live-fire Practice: 2.13.1.3.2.1.  This order provides students with the opportunity to fire five rounds of  ammunition  at  the  left  75-meter  silhouette  target  to  practice  applying immediate  action  procedures,  before  completing  evaluation.    Students  complete this  order  with  one,  5-round  magazine  of  live  ammunition  mixed  with  five dummy  rounds,  from  the  prone  supported  position.    When  loading  magazines, students randomly load five dummy and five live rounds into the magazine.  Once all  magazines  are  loaded,  students  pass  them  to  the  person  on  their  right.    The firing  line  official  (block  officer)  of  the  last  student  on  the  right  of  a  block  of students (e.g., 1-7, 8-14) passes this student’s magazine to the first student on the left of the firing block. 2.13.1.3.2.2.  Students  start  in  the  prone  position.    On  command  “LOAD,” students  release  the  bolt  forward  and  insert  the  magazine.    On  the  command “MAKE READY,” students ensure the selector is on Safe, charge the weapon to chamber a round, and assume the prone supported position. 2.13.1.3.2.3.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students attempt to engage the  left  side  75-meter  silhouette  on  the  SF  target.    When  a  stoppage  occurs, students announce  "COVER,” apply immediate action,  announce  "READY" and continue to fire at the same silhouette from the prone supported position until all rounds have been expended. 2.13.1.3.2.4.  Students,  who  cannot  successfully  complete  this  order,  receive additional training before proceeding to the next order of fire.  Combat Arms may complete this training on the spot, as long as it corrects whatever is preventing the student from accomplishing the task. 2.13.1.3.3.  Order 3 - Immediate Action Live-fire Evaluation: 2.13.1.3.3.1.  This  order  of  fire  is  for  evaluation.    When  loading  magazines, students randomly load five dummy and five live rounds into the magazine.  Once all  magazines  are  loaded,  students  pass  them  to  the  person  on  their  right.    The firing  line  official  (block  officer)  of  the  last  student  on  the  right  of  a  block  of students (e.g., 1-7, 8-14) passes this student’s magazine to the first student on the left of the firing block. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   41  2.13.1.3.3.2.  Students  start  in  the  prone  position.    On  the  command  “LOAD,” students  release  the  bolt  forward  and  insert  the  magazine.    On  the  command “MAKE READY,” students ensure the selector is on Safe, charge the weapon to chamber a round and assume the prone supported position. 2.13.1.3.3.3.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students attempt to engage the  right  side  75-meter  silhouette  on  the  SF  target.    When  a  stoppage  occurs, students announce  "COVER,” apply immediate action,  announce  "READY" and continue to fire at the same silhouette from the prone supported position until all rounds  have  been  expended.    To  pass  this  order  of  fire,  students  clear  all stoppages, expend all five rounds and achieve four hits in the right side 75-meter silhouette of the SF target. 2.13.1.3.3.4.  Students who cannot successfully complete this order receive same day remedial training or are scheduled for a remedial class until they can pass the live-fire evaluation. 2.13.1.4.  Phase IV - Basic Rifle Marksmanship Training/Practice. 2.13.1.4.1.  Order 1 - Prone Supported Practice:  Prior to students loading weapons or attempting live-fire, instructors demonstrate the position.  Students then assume the firing position while instructors analyze each student’s position and make corrections until each student achieves a solid firing position. 2.13.1.4.1.1.  Students  begin  with  two,  3-round  magazines in  their  ammo  pouch.  When  directed  by  the  tower  operator,  students  move  forward  to  the  firing  line, pick  up  their  weapon,  point  the  muzzle  down  range  and  assume  the  prone supported position.  On the command “LOAD,” students ensure the selector lever is  on  Safe,  release  the  bolt  forward  and  insert  a  3-round  magazine  from  their ammo pouch. 2.13.1.4.1.2.  On  the  command  “FIRE,”  students  charge  the  weapon,  take  aim, place the weapon on SEMI and engage all silhouettes (75m, 175m and 300m) on the left side of the SF target with one round each.  When the 3-round magazine is expended, students reload and once again engage the silhouettes (75m, 175m and 300m) on the left side of the SF target with one round each.  All firing should be completed within 50 seconds; however, as this is a training/practice order of fire, students who do not complete firing within the time limit are allowed to expend their rounds as directed by the tower operator. 2.13.1.4.2.  Order  2  -  Prone  Unsupported  Practice:  Prior  to  loading  weapons  or attempting  live-fire,  instructors  first  demonstrate  the  position.    Students  are  then placed  in  the  firing  position  while  instructors  analyze  each  student’s  position  and make corrections until each student achieves a solid firing position. 2.13.1.4.2.1.  Students  begin  with  two,  3-round  magazines in  their  ammo  pouch.

In  this  order  of  fire,  students  kneel below the cross piece of the barricade to conduct reloads (simulates use of cover). 2.13.1.5.4.2.  After completion of this order of fire, instructors mark hits and score targets. 2.13.1.6.  Phase  VI  -  CWDE  Firing  Techniques.  Note:   Department  of  the  Air  Force (DAF)  Civilian  Police  and  Guard  (GSXX-0083  and  GSXX-0085)  personnel  are  not required  to  complete  Phase  VI,  CWDE  Firing  Techniques  for  in-garrison  arming,  with the following exceptions.  Any deploying DAF Civilian Police who require arming with the  M4/M16A2  and  those  assigned  to  units  who  have  obtained  their  own  gas  masks  to support  in-garrison  requirements  fire  these  portions  of  the  courses.    If  these  personnel meet all other requirements and achieve the required score on all other phases, they are awarded “Expert” status. 2.13.1.6.1.  Order  1  -  CWDE  Teaching/Practice:  This  order  of  fire  is  for  training and  practice.    All  firing  is  completed  while  wearing  the  gas  mask  (with  protective shield) and protective gloves.  Instructors coach students on the firing position. 2.13.1.6.1.1.  Prior  to  loading  weapons  or  attempting  live-fire,  instructors  first demonstrate  the  position.    Students  are  then  placed  in  the  firing  position  while instructors  analyze  each  student’s  position  and  make  corrections  until  each student achieves a solid firing position. 2.13.1.6.1.2.  Students  begin  with  two,  3-round  magazines in  their  ammo  pouch.  When  directed  by  the  tower  operator,  students  move  forward  to  the  firing  line, pick  up  their  weapon,  point  the  muzzle  down  range  and  assume  the  kneeling supported position.

When the 3-round magazine is expended, students reload and engage the silhouettes (75m, 175m and 300m) on the  right  side  of  the  SF  target  with  one  round  each.    Students  are  allowed  60 AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   45  seconds to complete all firing; however, as this is a training/practice order of fire, students who do not complete firing within the time limit are allowed to expend their rounds as directed by the tower operator.  After completion of this order of fire,  instructors  mark  hits,  analyze  targets  and  coach  on  any  problems  identified during this order. 2.13.1.6.2.  Order  2  -  CWDE  Evaluation:  This  order  of  fire  is  for  instructors  to evaluate  the  students’  ability  to  successfully  engage  threats  while  wearing  the  gas mask (with protective shield) and protective gloves. 2.13.1.6.2.1.  Students  begin  with  two,  3-round  magazines in  their  ammo  pouch.  When  directed  by  the  tower  operator,  students  move  forward  to  the  firing  line, pick  up  their  weapon,  point  the  muzzle  down  range  and  assume  the  kneeling supported position.

TABLE II:  SHORT-RANGE COMBAT TRAINING. 2.13.2.1.  Phase I - Transition to Handgun Immediate Action (Group A Only). 2.13.2.1.1.  Order 1 - Transition to Handgun Dry-fire Practice: 2.13.2.1.1.1.  All personnel who participate in this order of fire must be currently qualified on the handgun.  (T-1).  This order is a “Go/No-Go” performance check for  personnel  who  are  required  to  be  armed  with  both  the  handgun  and rifle/carbine  simultaneously.    Students  complete  this  order  of  fire  with  an unloaded (clear)  M4 carbine and issued handgun.  Personnel who are not  armed with  both  the  handgun  and  rifle/carbine  at  the  same  time  may  complete  the classroom  training  and  performance  check  for  this  phase  of  training;  however, they  do  not  perform  the  live-fire  phases.    Combat  Arms  does  not  qualify personnel  on  the  handgun  merely  to  participate  in  this  phase  of  training.    All personnel who participate in this order of fire require an existing handgun arming requirement  and  a  requirement  to  be  armed  with  the  handgun  and  rifle/carbine simultaneously. 2.13.2.1.1.2.  When directed by the tower operator, instructors verify carbines and pistols are clear.  Students  then release the slide forward on the pistol, place the weapon  on  FIRE  and  secure  the  pistol  in  the  holster.    Students  then  pick  up  the M4,  release  the  bolt  forward,  ensure  the  weapon  is  on  Safe,  insert  an  empty magazine in the rifle/carbine and assume the low ready position. 2.13.2.1.1.3.  On  the  command  “UP,”  students  take  aim.    On  the  command   46  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  place  the  selector  to  SEMI  and  dry-fire  at  the target.    When  the  M4  fails  to  fire,  students  execute  the  transition  to  handgun (IAW with the AFSFC M4 Carbine Combat Arms Instructor Guide), dry-fire two times  at  the  Military  “E”  target  with  the  pistol,  and  then  execute  “Cover  and Sweep.”  There is no time limit for this order.  At the completion of each string of dry-fire and after securing the handgun in the holster, the tower operator instructs the students to point the rifle/carbine down range, lock the bolt to the rear on an empty magazine, place the selector lever on Safe and release the bolt forward to prepare for the next string of fire. 2.13.2.1.1.4.  All students complete a minimum of five dry-fire repetitions prior to being evaluated on the transition drill.  Students who cannot safely complete the dry-fire drill are not allowed to progress to live-fire until they complete remedial training and demonstrate competency with the technique. 2.13.2.1.2.  Order 2 - Transition to Handgun Dry-fire Evaluation: 2.13.2.1.2.1.  This order is a “Go/No-Go” for evaluation and students execute the transition five times within 6 seconds with no safety violations. 2.13.2.1.2.2.  Instructors  will  not  allow  students  who  do  not  pass  evaluation  to progress to live-fire. 2.13.2.1.3.  Order 3 - Transition to Handgun Live-fire Evaluation: 2.13.2.1.3.1.  Students begin with a cleared M4 carbine or rifle and 10 live rounds in the handgun from the low ready position.  Ensure the rifle/carbine has an empty magazine  inserted  in  the  magazine  well.    Personnel  who  do  not  have  a  tactical sling  use  the  “transition  without  sling”  technique  detailed  in  the  AFSFC  M4 Carbine Combat Arms Instructor Guide.  Instructors and students follow the same procedures  with  the  rifle/carbine  for  each  string  of  fire  as  those  used  in  Order 1 and Order 2 of this phase of fire. 2.13.2.1.3.2.  When  directed  by  the  tower  operator,  students  sling  the  carbine across the chest, load the pistol and holster.  Students ensure the M4 selector is on Safe and assume the low ready position. 2.13.2.1.3.3.  On  the  command  "UP,”  students  bring  the  gun  up  on  target  and stand by.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students place the weapon on SEMI  and  attempt  to  engage  the  target.    When  the  M4  fails  to  fire,  students remove the trigger finger from the trigger guard, attempt to place the weapon on Safe,  transition  to  the  handgun  and  engage  the  Military  “E”  target  with  a controlled  pair  within  the  6-second  time  limit.    After  each  string  of  fire  the students execute “Cover and Sweep” and holster the handgun. 2.13.2.1.3.4.  To  receive  a  “Go”  on  this  order  of  fire,  students  must  properly execute the transition to handgun and engage the target within the 6-second time limit.  Note:  Any student who points a weapon at themselves, another individual, or  does  not  remove  their  trigger  finger  from  the  trigger/trigger  guard  while transitioning  during  live-fire  receives  an  automatic  "No-Go"  and  should  be removed from the range. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   47  2.13.2.2.  Phase II - Tactical Engagement Techniques. 2.13.2.2.1.  All  orders  begin  with  weapons  slung  (if  using  a  tactical  sling)  from  the low ready position.  Students only load weapons at the firing line.  On the command “LOAD,” students  point the weapon down range and ensure the selector lever  is  on Safe (ensure the trigger finger is extended outside the trigger guard and the thumb is on top of the selector).  Students then release the bolt and insert the magazine.  On the command “MAKE READY,” students charge the weapon to chamber a round, verify the selector lever is Safe and assume the low ready position. 2.13.2.2.2.  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  sweep  the  selector lever to SEMI as they raise the weapon into firing position and engage the target with the appropriate number of rounds for that order of fire.  Firing strings for each order are completed in succession.  The tower operator briefs the number of shots and time limits for each string prior to beginning the firing order, not between each string.  As soon  as  all students  have  completed  firing  and have  reset  to  the low  ready  position, the command of “CONTACT FRONT” is repeated and the next string is immediately fired.  This sequence continues until the firing order is complete.  Instructors are only given extended time to coach students at the end of each order of fire. 2.13.2.2.3.  At the end of each string, students extend their trigger finger outside the trigger guard, “Cover” (45 degrees left and right), place the selector on Safe, recover to the low ready position and “Sweep” (check 180 degrees or as far as student is able to turn head on both the left and right side) by turning the head only, to complete the string  of  fire.    Prior  to  live-fire,  instructors  are  to  stress  the  need  for  accuracy  and recoil  control  through  proper  stance  and  the  importance  of  smooth  execution  over speed.    Instructors  also  remind  students  that  inside  25  meters,  the  bullet  point  of impact is approximately 2 inches below point of aim. 2.13.2.2.4.  Orders 1 and 2 - Singles and Controlled Pairs: 2.13.2.2.4.1.  The purpose of these orders is for students to practice assuming the firing position, operating the selector  lever,  acquiring a sight picture and rapidly engaging  the  threat.    Students  begin  with  a  12-round  magazine  in  their  weapon and  a  5-round  magazine  in  their  ammo  pouch.    Both  orders  begin  with  the weapons  slung  (if  using  a  tactical  sling).    On  the  command  “CONTACT FRONT,”  students  engage  the  Military  “E”  7-meter  target  with  one  round (singles).    Students  have  a  time  limit  of  2  seconds  per  string  for  a  total  of  four strings.    At  the  completion  of  the  fourth  string,  students  remain  in  position  and wait  for  the  next  command  to  begin  Order  2.    On  the  command  “CONTACT FRONT,”  students  engage  the  Military  “E”  7-meter  target  with  two  rounds (controlled pairs).  Students have a time limit of 2 seconds per string for a total of four  strings.    At  the  end  of  Orders  1  and  2  students  reload  with  the  5-round magazine  without  command  (to  prepare  for  Order  3,  Failure  to  Stop).    They immediately announce “COVER,” drop to one knee, reload, announce “READY,” execute  cover  and  sweep  from  the  kneeling  position.    Students  remain  kneeling until directed to stand up by the tower operator or an instructor. 2.13.2.2.4.2.  Instructors  continuously  stress  muzzle  discipline,  recoil  control through proper stance and the importance of smooth execution over speed.   48  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 2.13.2.2.5.  Order 3 - Failure to Stop: 2.13.2.2.5.1.  The  purpose  of  this  order  is  to  teach  students  to  execute  one precision shot to the 6-inch Incapacitation Zone in the event a controlled pair fails to  stop  the  threat.    Students  begin  with  a  5-round  magazine  in  the  weapon (reloaded at the end of Order 2, Controlled Pairs). 2.13.2.2.5.2.  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  engage  the  7-meter target in the 6-inch Incapacitation Zone on the Military “E” target with one round.  Students have a time limit of 3 seconds for each string. 2.13.2.2.5.3.  When  all  rounds  have  been  expended,  students  standby  in  the  low ready  position  until  directed  to  “SAFE  AND  CLEAR  WEAPONS.”    The  tower operator  then  makes  the  firing  line  safe  at  which  time  instructors  and  students analyze targets. 2.13.2.2.6.  Order 4 - Multiple Threats: 2.13.2.2.6.1.  The  purpose  of  this  order  is  to  teach  students  the  technique  of transitioning between multiple threats.  Prior to live-fire, instructors demonstrate the  technique  and  reinforce  proper  stance  and  smooth  movement  over  speed.  Instructors also stress that the eyes move first then the weapon follows. 2.13.2.2.6.2.  For this order, the two Military “E” targets should be spaced at least two feet apart; however, if this is not possible, the targets may be spaced with the sides touching each other.  Ranges with a single target per position configure the targets  according  to  paragraph  2.11.1.2.    The  intent  is  for  students  to  learn  to move the weapon laterally to engage multiple threats. 2.13.2.2.6.3.  Students begin with one, 8-round magazine in the weapon and one, 8-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT LEFT” or “CONTACT FRONT RIGHT,” students engage each target in the 10-inch  Lethal  Zone  on  the  Military  “E”  target  with  a  controlled  pair  (two  rounds each,  four  rounds  total)  within  the  4-second  time  limit.    When  the  weapon  is empty,  students  immediately  execute  a  standing  reload  without  command.  Targets are engaged in order (left to right (L/R) or right to left (R/L) as identified in  the  course  of  fire).    Upon  completion  of  this  order,  the  line  is  made  safe  and instructors analyze targets. 2.13.2.2.7.  Order 5 - Threat Discrimination: 2.13.2.2.7.1.  The  purpose  of  this  order  is  to  teach  students  to  discriminate between  threats  and  non-threats  (friend  or  foe).    To  aid  in  acquiring  the  proper target, prior to firing the instructors use a white marker to mark each Military “E” 15-meter target with a large visible “1” and “2” on the pelvic (lower) portion of the targets.  For units with AFSFC/FGWL approval to use a single target, prepare targets as depicted in Figure  2.2 with two 10-inch circles drawn on one Military “E” target and each circle numbered with a large “1” and “2.” 2.13.2.2.7.2.  Students  begin  with  an  8-round  magazine  loaded  in  the  weapon from the low ready position. 2.13.2.2.7.3.  Prior to live-fire, instructors stress the need to positively identify the AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   49  threat  before  firing  and  remind  students  that,  during  qualification,  engaging  the wrong target results in failure on this order of fire. 2.13.2.2.7.4.  The  firing  command  for  this  order  is  “CONTACT  FRONT,” followed  immediately  by  the  number  on  the  target.    For  example,  given  the command “CONTACT FRONT...ONE,” students would engage the Military “E” target with a “1” marked on the bottom.  On the command, students acquire and engage the threat designated by the tower operator within the 4-second time limit. 2.13.2.2.7.5.  Students  must  demonstrate  the  ability  to  discriminate  between threats  and  friendly  (non-combatant)  targets  with  100  percent  accuracy.    (T-1).  Students  who  engage  the  wrong  (friendly/non-combatant)  targets  receive  a  “No-Go” on this order of fire and receive remedial training and refire. 2.13.2.2.7.6.  At  the  end  of  the  order  when  all  rounds  have  been  expended,  the line is made safe.  Targets are then marked and analyzed. 2.13.2.2.8.  Order 6 - Standing Burst Fire: 2.13.2.2.8.1.  The purpose of this order is to teach students the effectiveness and limitations of burst firing as well as proper technique when utilizing burst fire. 2.13.2.2.8.2.  Prior to live-fire, instructors stress the need for accuracy and recoil control  through  a  proper  aggressive  stance  and  the  importance  of  smooth execution over speed.  Instructors also remind students that point of aim should be mid torso.  Instructors observe students as they practice the firing stance to ensure proper technique. 2.13.2.2.8.3.  Students begin with a 9-round magazine in the low ready position. 2.13.2.2.8.4.  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  engage  the Military “E” target at 25 meters with a 3-round burst.  Students have a time limit of 4 seconds per string. 2.13.2.2.8.5.  At  the  end  of  the  order  when  all  rounds  have  been  expended, students clear and ground their weapons.  Instructors make the line safe then mark and analyze targets. 2.13.2.3.  Phase III - Tactical Movement and Use of Cover Techniques. 2.13.2.3.1.  Orders 1, 2, 3 and 4 - Lateral Movement: 2.13.2.3.1.1.  The purpose of these  orders are to teach  students  to engage threats while  moving  laterally  and  reinforce  the  tactical  necessity  to  move,  making oneself a hard target, rather than standing anchored in one place.  All techniques are  instructed  and  conducted  as  outlined  in  the  AFSFC  M4  Carbine  Instructor Guide. 2.13.2.3.1.2.  Prior  to  live-fire,  instructors  demonstrate  the  techniques  and supervise  students  as  they  practice  moving  left  and  right  as  well  as  “cover  and sweep.”    Instructors  evaluate  and  coach  students  for  correct  execution  paying particular  attention  to  safety.    Ensure  students  learn  to  execute  the  movements without  sweeping  other  personnel  with  the  muzzle  of  their  weapon.    During movement,  students  do  not  place  the  trigger  finger  on  the  trigger  or  the  selector   50  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 lever on SEMI until the movement is complete and they are ready to fire.  Ensure students  demonstrate  competency  before  progressing  to  live-fire.    Students  who cannot  correctly  execute  the  maneuver  receive  remedial  training  until  they demonstrate competency.  Instructors should also continue to stress recoil control through  proper  stance  and  the  importance  of  smooth  execution  over  speed.  WARNING:    During  orders  requiring  movement,  instructors  ensure  brass and other debris that could cause personnel to stumble or fall is cleared from the range floor prior to firing. 2.13.2.3.1.3.  Students begin with one, 4-round magazine in their weapon and one, 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  All orders of fire begin in the low ready position on the far right or left of the firing position as described in the course of fire.  Students side step right or left to the other side of the shooting position (as far as possible) and engage the target with a controlled pair.  When moving with the  weapon,  trigger  fingers  are  straight  and  extended  on  the  receiver,  the weapon’s  muzzle  is  dropped  slightly  below  line  of  sight  but  remains  pointed  at the target line at all times. 2.13.2.3.1.4.  Order  1  –  Move  Left:  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,” students step left and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” target with  two  rounds.    Students  have  a  6-second  time  limit  for  this  order.    Upon completion of firing, students remain on the left side of their shooting position in the low ready position with their weapons on Safe and trigger finger extended on the receiver. 2.13.2.3.1.5.  Order  2  –  Move  Right:  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students step right and engage the 10- inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” target with  two  rounds.    Students  have  a  6-second  time  limit  for  this  order.    When  all rounds  have  been  expended,  students  immediately  execute  a  standing  reload, conduct  their  “Cover  and  Sweep”  and  place  their  weapon  on  Safe.    Students remain on the right side of their shooting position in the low ready position. 2.13.2.3.1.6.  Order  3  –  Move  Left:  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,” students step left and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” target with  two  rounds.    Students  have  a  6-second  time  limit  for  this  order.    Upon completion of firing, students remain on the left side of their shooting position in the low ready position with their weapons on Safe and trigger finger extended on the receiver. 2.13.2.3.1.7.  Order  4  –  Move  Right:  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students step right and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” target with  two  rounds.    Students  have  a  6-second  time  limit  for  this  order.    After  all firing is complete, students “Safe and Clear” weapons and the firing line is made safe.  Instructors and students then mark hits and analyze targets. 2.13.2.3.2.  Order 5 – Standing and Low Kneeling Right Barricade: 2.13.2.3.2.1.  The purpose of this order is to teach students to seek and use cover.  Prior to live-fire, instructors demonstrate the techniques stressing the importance of  seeking  and  using  cover.    Instructors  then  supervise  students  as  they  practice AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   51  tactical  use  of  cover.    Instructors  evaluate  and  coach  students  for  correct execution  paying  particular  attention  to  safety.    Ensure  students  learn  to  move without  sweeping  other  personnel  with  the  muzzle  of  their  weapon.    During movement,  students  do  not  place  their  trigger  finger  inside  the  trigger  guard.  Ensure students demonstrate competency before progressing to live-fire.  Students who cannot correctly execute the maneuver do not progress to live-fire until they receive  remedial  training  and  demonstrate  competency.    Instructors  should continue  to  stress  recoil  control  through  proper  stance,  smooth  execution  over speed and tactical use of cover.  This order teaches students to react to an audible command,  turn  and  engage  threats  while  demonstrating  safe  weapon  handling procedures. 2.13.2.3.2.2.  Instructors  should  also  continue  to  stress  recoil  control  through proper stance as well as the importance of smooth execution over speed.  Students “Cover and Sweep” at the end of each string of fire. 2.13.2.3.2.3.  Students begin with one, 4-round magazine in the weapon and one, 4-round  magazine  in  their  ammo  pouch.    When  directed  by  the  tower  operator, students “LOAD” and “MAKE READY.”  The tower operator then instructs the students to step back, place their heels on the Ready Line and remain in the low ready  position.    On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  move diagonally forward and left to a right standing barricade position and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” 25-meter target with four rounds. 2.13.2.3.2.4.  Once  all  four  rounds  have  been  expended  and  the  magazine  is empty,  students  announce  “COVER,”  kneel  behind  the  barricade  (take  cover), conduct  a  reload,  announce  “READY,”  roll  out  right  around  the  barricade  and engage the Military “E” 25-meter target with four rounds from the low kneeling position.  Students have a time limit of 15 seconds for this order. 2.13.2.3.2.5.  Upon  completion  of  firing,  students  remain  behind  cover  in  the kneeling  position,  execute “Cover  and Sweep” and standby until  directed by the tower operator to stand. 2.13.2.3.3.  Order 6 – Standing and Low Kneeling Left Barricade: 2.13.2.3.3.1.  Students begin with one, 4-round magazine in the weapon and one, 4-round  magazine  in  their  ammo  pouch.    When  directed  by  the  tower  operator, students “LOAD” and “MAKE READY.”  The tower operator then instructs the students to step back, place their heels on the Ready Line and remain in the low ready  position.    On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  move diagonally forward and right to a left standing barricade position and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” 25-meter target with four rounds. 2.13.2.3.3.2.  Once  all  four  rounds  have  been  expended  and  the  magazine  is empty,  students  announce  “COVER,”  kneel  behind  the  barricade  (take  cover), conduct  a  reload,  announce  “READY,”  roll  out  left  around  the  barricade  and engage the Military “E” 25-meter target with four rounds from the low kneeling position.  Students have a time limit of 15 seconds for this order. 2.13.2.3.3.3.  Upon  completion  of  firing,  students  remain  behind  cover  in  the   52  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 kneeling  position  and  execute  “Cover  and  Sweep.”    Students  then  standby  until directed by the tower operator to stand and “Safe and Clear” weapons.  Once the firing line has been made safe, instructors and students mark and analyze targets. 2.13.2.3.3.4.  As  this  is  a  practice  order,  students  who  do  not  complete  firing within the time limit are allowed to expend their rounds as directed by the tower operator. 2.13.2.4.  Phase IV – Short-Range Combat Evaluation: 2.13.2.4.1.  This  phase  is  for  qualification/evaluation  on  all  techniques  practiced  in Phases  II  and  III.    For  all  orders,  on  the  command  “LOAD,”  students  ensure  the selector  is  on  Safe,  release  the  bolt  and  insert  the  magazine.    On  the  command “MAKE  READY,”  students  charge  the  weapon  to  chamber  a  round,  ensure  the selector is on Safe, trigger finger straight and extended on the receiver, thumb on the selector  lever  and  assume  the  low  ready  position.    Personnel  operating  a  weapon equipped  with  a  1,  2  or  3-point  tactical  sling  should  have  the  weapon  slung.    All reloading  is  done  from  issued  ammo  pouches.    Students  who  violate  safety  are removed from the range, complete remedial training and demonstrate competency by passing performance checks prior to attempting qualification later. 2.13.2.4.2.  At  the  end  of  each  string,  students  extend  the  trigger  finger  outside  the trigger guard, execute “Cover and Sweep,” place the selector on Safe and recover to the low ready position.  The “Sweep” (check 180 degrees or as far as student is able to turn head on both the left and right side) is conducted by the student turning only their  head.    “Cover  and  Sweep”  is  not  part  of  the  time  limit  and  may  be  conducted after  the  “Cease  Fire” command  is  given.    Students  who  fail  to  execute  “Cover  and Sweep” forfeit their rounds for that particular string.  Additionally, students who fail to utilize cover when firing or reloading also forfeit rounds fired during that particular string. 2.13.2.4.3.  During  all  orders  of  fire,  students  clear  their  own  stoppages  without assistance; however, instructors closely observe and intervene if necessary to ensure safety.    During  orders  requiring  students  to  reload,  students  execute  the  reload without  command;  they  announce  “COVER”  before  reloading  and  “READY”  after completing the reload. 2.13.2.4.4.  Students  who  do  not  complete  firing  within  the  time  limit  due  to stoppages are considered “alibis” unless the stoppage was due to improper operation of the weapon by the student.  Instructors can pro-rate time, based on 2 seconds per round, for alibi students and allow them to complete the string of fire  as directed by the tower operator. 2.13.2.4.5.  Order 1 – Threat Discrimination Qualification: 2.13.2.4.5.1.  This  order  of  fire  evaluates  the  student’s  ability  to  discriminate between  threats  and  non-threats.    Students  must  achieve  100  percent  threat discrimination  to  qualify.    (T-1).    Students  who  engage  non-threat  targets  are considered  unqualified  and  either  successfully  refire  the  order  of  fire  or successfully complete remedial training to be qualified on the weapon.  To aid in acquiring  the  proper  target,  prior  to  firing  the  instructors  use  a  white  marker  to AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   53  mark  each  Military  “E”  target  with  a  large  visible  “1”  and  “2”  on  the  “pelvic” (lower)  portion  of  the  targets.    For  units  with  AFSFC/FGWL  approval  to  use  a single  target,  prepare  targets  as  depicted  in  Figure  2.2  with  two  10-inch  circles drawn on one Military “E” target and each circle numbered with a large “1” and “2.” 2.13.2.4.5.2.  Students  begin  with  a  6-round  magazine  in  the  weapon.    Firing commands for this order are “CONTACT FRONT,” followed immediately by the number on the target.  For example, given the command “CONTACT FRONT ... ONE,”  students  would  engage  the  Military  “E”  target  with  a  “1”  marked  on  the bottom.  On the command, students acquire and engage  the threat designated by the tower operator within the 6-second time limit.  Students fire two rounds at the appropriate  Military  “E”  target  on  each  “CONTACT  FRONT!  …  [TARGET NUMBER]”  command.    After  completion  of  this  order  of  fire,  instructors  mark and score targets. 2.13.2.4.6.  Order 2 – Multiple Threats with Failure to Stop Qualification: 2.13.2.4.6.1.  This order of fire evaluates the student’s ability to engage multiple threats  and  execute  the  “Failure  Drill.”    This  simulates  the  threat’s  “Failure  to Stop” after being engaged with the first controlled pair.  Students start with a 5-round  magazine  in  the  weapon.    The  target  configuration  is  the  same  as  the previous order of fire as outlined in paragraph 2.13.2.4.5.1. 2.13.2.4.6.2.  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  engage  the  10-inch  Lethal  Zones  on  the  left  7-meter  Military  “E”  target  then  the  right  7-meter Military “E” target with a controlled pair on each, then return to the left 7-meter Military “E” target and fire one shot into the 6 inch Incapacitation Zone within the 10-second time limit.  The target configuration is the same as the previous order of fire as outlined in paragraph 2.13.2.4.5.1. 2.13.2.4.7.  Orders  3  and  4  –  Tactical  Movement  and  Use  of  Cover Qualification:  These  orders  of  fire  evaluate  the  student’s  ability  to  move  to  and engage  threats  from  cover.    Students  begin  with  a  2-round  magazine  in  the  weapon and  three,  2-round  magazines  in  their  ammo  pouches.    The  Military  “E”  targets  are positioned at the 25-meter target line.  Upon completion of order 4, instructors mark and score targets.  Note:  Orders 2, 3 and 4 have a combined number of hits to meet qualification and expert status. 3 – Standing 2.13.2.4.7.1.  Order and  Low  Kneeling  Right Barricade:  Students begin at the extreme right of their firing point, on the ready line in the low ready position.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students move  diagonally  forward  and  left  to  the  standing  barricade  position.    Students then engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” target with a controlled pair.    Once  the  two  rounds  have  been  expended  and  the  magazine  is  empty, students  immediately  kneel  behind  cover,  conduct  a  reload,  roll  out  to  the  right and re-engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone of the Military “E” target with a controlled pair  in  the  low  kneeling  position.    Students  have  a  20-second  time  limit  for  this order.   54  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 2.13.2.4.7.2.  Order 4 – Standing and Low Kneeling Left Barricade:  Students begin  at  the extreme left of their firing  point, on the ready line in  the low ready position.    On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  move  diagonally forward  and  right  to  the  standing  barricade  position.    Students  then  engage  10-inch Lethal Zone on the Military “E” target with a controlled pair.  Once the two rounds  have  been  expended  and  the  magazine  is  empty,  students  immediately kneel behind cover, conduct a reload, roll out to the left and re-engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone of the Military “E” target with a controlled pair in the low kneeling position.  Students have a 20-second time limit for this order. 2.13.2.4.8.  Order 5 – Standing Burst/Automatic Firing Evaluation:  This order of fire evaluates the student’s ability to rapidly engage threats with burst/automatic fire.  Students  load  with  a  9-round  magazine  and  assume  the  low  ready  position.    On  the command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  engage  the  Military  “E”  target  with  nine rounds, using 3-round bursts.  Students have a 10-second limit for this order and the Military “E” targets are positioned on the 25-meter target line.  After completion of this order of fire, instructors mark and score targets. 2.13.3.  TABLE III:  NIGHT THREAT ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. 2.13.3.1.  The purpose of this table is to train and evaluate students on the skills needed to effectively  engage  threats  in  limited  or  zero  visibility  environments.    All  Phases  and orders  of  fire  begin  in  the  low  ready  position  with  the  exception  of  Phases  III:    Night Vision Optics and Laser Aiming Devices Zero (Orders 1-3) and Phase IV:  Night Scope Teaching and Evaluation (Orders 1 and 2).  Students execute “Cover and Sweep” at the end  of  all  orders  or  strings  of  fire.    Failure  to  do  so  results  in  forfeiture  of  the  rounds fired.  All Table III firing is conducted with the Military “E” targets positioned at the 25-meter target line. 2.13.3.2.  Phase I – Night M68 CCO/DOS Training and Evaluation. 2.13.3.2.1.  Orders 1 and 2 – M68 CCO/DOS Training and Evaluation: 2.13.3.2.1.1.  The  purpose  of  these  orders  is  to  train  students  on  techniques  to successfully  engage  threats  during  night  or  in  limited  visibility  using  the  M68 CCO, DOS or iron sights (pointing technique). 2.13.3.2.1.2.  Lights are dimmed but not totally out as students need to be able to identify their targets.  Instructors must ensure they are able to observe the actions of  the  students  on  the  firing  line.    (T-1).    Consideration  is  to  be  given  to  allow dimmable lights on the range to produce the desired results. 2.13.3.2.1.3.  Order 1 – Training/Practice: 2.13.3.2.1.3.1.  Students  begin  with  a  2-round  magazine  in  the  weapon  and five, 2-round magazines in their ammo pouches.  On the command “LOAD,” students  ensure  the  selector  is  on  Safe,  release  the  bolt  and  insert  a  2-round magazine.  On the command “MAKE READY,” students charge the weapon to  chamber  a  round;  ensure  the  trigger  finger  is  extended  outside  the  trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position. 2.13.3.2.1.3.2.  On the command “CONTACT  FRONT,” students  engage the AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   55  10-inch  Lethal  Zone  of  the  Military  “E”  target  with  two  rounds  from  the standing  position.    Once  the  two  rounds  have  been  expended  and  the magazine  is  empty,  students  immediately  kneel,  conduct  a  reload  and reengage  the  Military  “E”  target  from  the  high  kneeling  position  with  two rounds.    Students  have  a  time  limit  of  15  seconds  per  string.    Under  the direction  and  commands  of  the  tower  operator, students  repeat  this  order  for two more strings of fire.  Students execute a reload every time the weapon is empty. 2.13.3.2.1.3.3.  After  completion  of  this  order  of  fire,  students  clear  and ground weapons.  Then instructors analyze and mark targets. 2.13.3.2.1.4.  Order 2 – Evaluation: 2.13.3.2.1.4.1.  Students begin with a 4-round magazine in the weapon and a 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command “LOAD,” students ensure the selector is on Safe, release the bolt and insert a 4-round magazine.  On the command “MAKE READY,” students charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is extended outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position. 2.13.3.2.1.4.2.  On the command “CONTACT  FRONT,” students  engage the 10-inch  Lethal  Zone  of  the  Military  “E”  target  with  four  rounds  from  the standing  position.    Once  the  four  rounds  have  been  expended  and  the magazine  is  empty,  students  immediately  kneel,  conduct  a  reload  and reengage  the  Military  “E”  target  from  the  high  kneeling  position  with  four rounds.  Students have a time limit of 15 seconds for this order. 2.13.3.2.1.4.3.  When all firing is complete, instructors mark and score targets. 2.13.3.3.  Phase II – Weapon Mounted Light Training and Evaluation. 2.13.3.3.1.  Orders 1 and 2 – Weapon Mounted Light Training and Evaluation: 2.13.3.3.1.1.  The  purpose  of  these  orders  is  to  teach  students  to  rapidly  engage threats utilizing the weapon mounted light. 2.13.3.3.1.2.  All down range lights should be turned off (not dimmed) as students need  to  be  able  to  identify  downrange  targets  using  only  the  weapon  mounted light.  However, instructors must ensure they are able to observe the actions of the students on the firing line.   (T-1).  Combat Arms is  to  consider using dimmable lights  on  the  firing  platform  (or  over  firing  positions)  to  allow  observation  of students or the use of night vision devices by instructors for this purpose. 2.13.3.3.1.3.  Instructors remind students the M68 dot intensity should be adjusted to prevent the light from obscuring visibility of the dot. 2.13.3.3.1.4.  Order 1 – Training/Practice: 2.13.3.3.1.4.1.  Students begin with a 6-round magazine in the weapon and 6-round  magazine  in  their  ammo  pouch.    On  the  command  “LOAD,”  students ensure the selector is on Safe, release the bolt and insert a 6-round magazine.  On the command “MAKE READY,” students charge the weapon to chamber   56  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 a round; ensure the trigger finger is extended outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position. 2.13.3.3.1.4.2.  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  raise  the weapon, momentarily activate the light (strobe) and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone  of  the  Military  “E”  target  with  a  controlled  pair  within  the  15-second time limit.  When six rounds have been expended and the magazine is empty, students  automatically  reload  with  a  6-round  magazine  from  the  pouch (students  do  not  fire  after  reloading  until  the  next  string  of  fire).    Under  the direction  and  commands  of  the  tower  operator, students  repeat  this  order  for six  strings  of  fire.    When  all  firing  is  complete,  the  firing  line  is  made  safe, and then instructors mark and analyze targets. 2.13.3.3.1.5.  Order 2 – Evaluation: 2.13.3.3.1.5.1.  Students begin with a 4-round magazine in the weapon and a 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the command “LOAD,” students ensure the selector is on Safe, release the bolt and insert a 4-round magazine.  On the command “MAKE READY,” students charge the weapon to chamber a round; ensure the trigger finger is extended outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position. 2.13.3.3.1.5.2.  On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  raise  the weapon, momentarily activate the light (strobe) and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone  of  the  Military  “E”  target  with  four  rounds.    Once  the  four  rounds  are expended and the magazine is empty, students automatically reload with a 4-round  magazine  and  reengage  the  10-inch  Lethal  Zone  of  the  Military  “E” target.  Students have a time limit of 15 seconds for this order. 2.13.3.3.1.5.3.  When all firing is complete, the firing line is made safe, then instructors mark and score targets. 2.13.3.4.  Phase  III  –  Night  Vision  Optics/Laser  Aiming  Devices  Training  and Evaluation. 2.13.3.4.1.  The  purpose  of  this  phase  of  fire  is  to  teach  students  to  rapidly  engage threats utilizing night vision optics in conjunction with laser aiming devices.  Combat Arms only allows the use of laser aiming devices that have been certified safe to use by the USAF Laser System Safety Review Board and that are identified as approved for  the  user’s  organization/agency  on  the  AFSFC/FGWL  USAF  Authorized  Small Arms/Light weapons (SA/LW) Accessories Listing. 2.13.3.4.2.  Orders 1, 2, and 3 – Laser Aiming Device Zero: 2.13.3.4.2.1.  These orders are for zero and practice.  Students are given 10 rounds to  zero  their  individually  issued  laser-aiming  device.    Students  also  use  an approved issued night vision device to include, but not limited to, the AN/PVS-14 Night  Vision  Monocular  or  AN/PVS-7  Night  Vision  Goggle.    Instructors  use zeroing procedures found in the applicable operator’s manual for the laser-aiming device.  Zero is considered complete when students achieve a 4cm, 3-round shot group  within  the  required  impact  zone  on  the  target.    WARNING:    Treat  all AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   57  lasers as a loaded weapon!  Do not allow anyone to point the laser at another individual or look directly at the laser beam.  Only use lasers in momentary mode.  Instructors verify all lasers are off prior to anyone moving forward of the  weapons,  such  as  when  going  down  range  to  mark  hits  and  analyze targets.  This is to prevent anyone from being injured by an active laser. 2.13.3.4.2.2.  Students  complete  the  appropriate  orders  of  fire  dependent  on device(s)  they  are  issued  or  with  which  they  deploy.    The  AN/PVS-14  or AN/PVS-7 can be used in the helmet mounted, head harness mounted or weapon mounted (PVS-14)  configuration.  It is  imperative that  students  fire  these orders using the configuration consistent with their method of employment. 2.13.3.4.3.  Order 4 – Laser Aiming Device Training/Practice: 2.13.3.4.3.1.  The purpose of this order is to teach students to effectively engage threats  using  night  vision/aiming  devices.    Students  begin  with  a  12-round magazine in the weapon.  On the command “LOAD,” students ensure the selector is  on  Safe,  release  the  bolt  and  insert  a  12-round  magazine.    On  the  command “MAKE  READY,”  students  charge  the  weapon  to  chamber  a  round;  ensure  the trigger finger is extended outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position. 2.13.3.4.3.2.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students raise the weapon, momentarily activate the laser and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone of the Military “E”  target  with  a  controlled  pair  within  the  6-second  time  limit.    Under  the direction and commands of the tower operator, students repeat this for a total of six, two shot strings.  When all firing is complete, the firing line is made safe, and then instructors mark and analyze targets. 2.13.3.4.4.  Order 5 – Laser Aiming Device Evaluation: 2.13.3.4.4.1.  This  order  of  fire  evaluates  the  student’s  ability  to  effectively engage  threats  with  night  vision/laser  aiming  devices.    Students  begin  with  a  4-round magazine in the weapon and a 4-round magazine in their ammo pouch.  On the  command  “LOAD,”  students  ensure  the  selector  is  on  Safe,  release  the  bolt and  insert  a  4-round  magazine.    On  the  command  “MAKE  READY,”  students charge  the  weapon  to  chamber  a  round;  ensure  the  trigger  finger  is  extended outside the trigger guard, thumb resting on the selector lever and assume the low ready position. 2.13.3.4.4.2.  On the command “CONTACT FRONT,” students raise the weapon, momentarily activate the laser and engage the 10-inch Lethal Zone of the Military “E”  target with  four  rounds.    Once  the  four  rounds  have  been  expended  and  the magazine  is  empty,  students  automatically  reload  with  a  4-round  magazine  and reengage  the  Military  “E”  target.    Students  have  a  16-second  time  limit  for  this order.    When  all  firing  is  complete,  the  firing  line  is  made  safe,  then  instructors mark and score targets.     58  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 2.13.3.5.  Phase IV – Night Scope Training and Evaluation. 2.13.3.5.1.  The  purpose  of  this  phase  of  fire  is  to  teach  students  to  engage  threats using  an  AFSFC  approved  night  scope.    Students  fire  this  phase  from  the  prone supported position.  Prior to each order, On the command “LOAD,” students close the bolt and insert a loaded magazine. 2.13.3.5.2.  Order  1  –  Night  Scope  Training/Practice:  Students  begin  with  a  5-round  magazine.    On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  engage  the  25-meter “Z” target with five rounds within the 30-second time limit.  Upon completion of  this  order,  the  firing  line  is  made  safe,  and  then  instructors  mark  and  analyze targets. 2.13.3.5.3.  Order 2 – Night Scope Evaluation:  This order of fire is for evaluation.  Students  begin  with  a  5-round  magazine.    On  the  command  “CONTACT  FRONT,” students engage  the 25-meter “Z” target with  five rounds within the 30-second time limit.    Upon  completion  of  this  order,  the  firing  line  is  made  safe,  then  instructors mark and score targets. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   59  Table 2.3.

The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the  minimum  training; weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship  skills  and performance evaluations required for qualification with a handgun. 3.2.  Training Overview. 3.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student's  first  participation  in  the  handgun  training program.  Initial training consists of classroom instruction, performance evaluations, passing all training objectives in Table 3.1 and qualifying on the handgun AFQC.  Initial training on AFQC is a prerequisite before proceeding to more advanced specialized training courses. 3.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  required  AFQC,  and  passing mechanical  evaluations.    Frequency  of  this  training  is  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Weapons safety procedures and the training objectives in Table 3.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for Group A recurring training. 3.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 3.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of Combat Arms verifying that  students  can  properly  perform  all  weapon  operator  skills.    Marksmanship  skills  are evaluated during live-fire.  Combat Arms evaluates students on objectives during all training. 3.2.5.  Unit  Training.    Refresher  training  on  operator  skills  and  knowledge  provided  by weapons  qualified  members  of  a  unit  to  help  maintain  the  individual's  weapon  handling proficiency.  Units should conduct this training before exercises and deployments. 3.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 3.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 3.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. 3.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator   64  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 3.4.  Handgun  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following  paragraphs  is intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for  initial  and recurring  training.    Students  must  meet  and  be  evaluated  to  the  performance  standards  of  the training  objectives  listed  in  Table  3.1    (T-1).    Note:    Training  times  may  vary  depending  on class  size,  student  experience  level,  range  location,  etc.    Approximate  training  times  for  this program are: 3.4.1.  For AFQC – 5 to 6 hours. 3.4.2.  For remedial and unit training – as required. 3.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to employ the handgun in offensive and defensive roles. 3.6.  Training  Objectives  AFQC.  Training objectives for successful completion of this course are found in Table  3.1  The objectives are listed in sequence as covered in the lesson plan and events that take place throughout the training day.  Students must meet objectives for the weapon and equipment they are issued for duty or with which they deploy.  (T-1). 3.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.

Targets  for the course:  Use the Military "E" target  facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874) and Military "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or suitable substitute prepared with circles for the Incapacitation Zone (head) and Lethal Zone (torso) as depicted in Figure 3.2. and prepared as outlined in paragraph 3.11.4.  Targets may need to be hung lower to avoid shooting overhead baffles and/or target holders.  Note:  Combat Arms may use targets with pre-printed  circles  that  have  been  approved  by  AFSFC/FGWL.    These  type  targets  are available from some civilian target manufacturers. 3.11.2.  Evaluation Standards: 3.11.2.1.  Qualified:  35 hits on target (77.7%). 3.11.2.2.  Expert:  41 hits (91.1%) on target with at least 25 hits within the 10-inch (vital area)  circle  (81.3%)  and  6  hits  within  the  6-inch  (head)  circle  (46%).    Note:    Combat Arms  is  not  required  to  annotate  all  three  scores  in  SFMIS  (AF  Form  522).    Combat Arms  enters  the  total  number  of  hits  on  the  target  (e.g.,  35,  41,  43)  and  the  applicable status (e.g., UQ, Q or E).  Therefore, both a score of 42 with a status of Q or a score of 42 with a status of E are acceptable entries in SFMIS. 3.11.3.  Course Notes: 3.11.3.1.  Common Notes: 3.11.3.1.1.  WARNING:  Before  starting live-fire  training,  ensure  students establish a proper grip with the handgun and do not have their thumb blocking the rear of the slide.  Serious injury can occur if a portion of the student’s hand makes contact with the slide during recoil. 3.11.3.1.2.  There  is  no  zeroing  order;  however,  instructors  check  bullet  impact  and discuss the adjusted aiming point method if the point of impact is substantially off the vital area of the target and is not caused by shooter errors, such as jerking the trigger, flinching, anticipation of recoil, healing, etc. 3.11.3.1.3.  Begin  each  order  and  string  of  fire  with  the  handgun  loaded  as  directed for daily carry in AFMAN 31-129, USAF Small Arms and Light Weapons Handling Procedures.    For  the  M9,  start  with  a  round  in  the  chamber,  hammer  down  and  the decocking lever in the FIRE position (first round double action).  Students are to fire the first round in each order and string of fire double action.  To ensure consistency, the  “Field  Interview  Stance”  (placing  hands  on  belt  buckle  area)  is  only  used  as  a starting  point  (to  ensure  consistency)  for  each  student  prior  to  drawing  the  weapon from the holster. 3.11.3.1.4.  Except  for  AFOSI  agents  and  Security  Forces  investigators,  individuals are  not  to  complete  live-fire  using  shoulder,  cross  draw,  or  concealed  holsters (drawing from the concealed carry).  When firing with shoulder holsters, individuals are  positioned  on  every  other  firing  point.    For  other  authorized  users  of  these  type holsters,  Combat  Arms  will  include  a  combination  of  classroom  and  range  dry-fire training/evaluation  on  the  proper  techniques  for  drawing  the  weapon  as  directed  in AFI 36-2654.   72  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 3.11.3.1.5.  Students  will  train  and  qualify  with  their  authorized  issued  duty  holster (from the USAF Authorized SA/LW Accessories listing), whether the holster is part of their field gear or  concealed wear.    (T-1).  The evaluation phase of the AFQC is fired as the holster qualification course.  When individuals are authorized additional Air Force approved holsters (from the USAF Authorized SA/LW Accessories listing) by  their  unit  commander,  Combat  Arms  will  use  the  procedures  in  AFI  36-2654  to qualify  them.    Document  qualification  and  holster  type(s)  in  the  remarks  section  of the AF Form 522.  Individuals live-fire with their primary holster, unless prohibited by the previous paragraph. 3.11.3.1.6.  The  over-barricade  position  is  a  supported  position.    Do  not  allow  the weapon to touch the support.  Students use the barricade for support. 3.11.3.1.7.  WARNING:  Combat  Arms  personnel  must  visually  inspect  all weapons,  magazines  and  magazine  pouches  at  the  end  of  live-fire  training  to ensure  they  do  not  contain  live  rounds.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  personnel  will make  all  weapons  rack  safe,  as  defined  in  AFMAN  31-129,  prior  to  removal from the firing line (students may transport weapons in their holsters once made rack safe).  (T-1). 3.11.3.1.8.  For  all  strings  except  strong  side/support  side  barricade:    Unless  the weapon is empty, once a student has completed a string of fire, the student remains on target  and  continues  to  scan  until  the  command  “CEASE  FIRE”  has  been  given  or when  the  target  is  turned  on  edge.    Once  the  command  “CEASE  FIRE”  has  been given, or the target turns on edge, students remain on target until the tower operator gives the command “ASSESS.”  Upon the command, students lower the weapon just below eye level to the Weaver Ready position.  Once at the Weaver Ready position, students  automatically  decock  (if  applicable  to  the  handgun  model)  the  weapon  and remain  in  this  position  looking  at  the  target  until  the  command  “SWEEP”  has  been given.  Students should rotate at the hips sweeping side to side simulating a search for additional targets.  Upon the command “HOLSTER,” students then return the weapon to  their  holster  and  secure  it  with  the  retention  device  (e.g.,  thumb  break,  loop,  or latch).    This  technique ensures  students  do  not  automatically  take  their  weapons  off target  and  holster  without  first  ensuring  the  threat  is  eliminated.    If  the  weapon  is empty,  students  take  cover  as  appropriate,  clear  their  weapons  and  follow  the instructions  from  the  tower  operator.    When  reloading  or  performing  immediate actions,  students  bring  the  weapon  near  eye  level  if  necessary  to  retain  visibility  of the target (weapon may be brought closer to the body as needed to accomplish these tasks).    This  technique  ensures  the  student  is  not  taking  their  eyes  away  from  the simulated  threat  until  the  simulated  threat  is  eliminated  by  the  “CEASE  FIRE” command or the target being turned on edge. 3.11.3.1.9.  For strong side/support side barricade:  Unless the weapon is empty, once a student has completed a string of fire, the student immediately removes their finger from the trigger and returns to the Weaver Ready position behind the barricade.  Once behind  the  barricade,  students  decock  the  weapon  (if  applicable  to  the  handgun model).  This technique ensures students are not placing their weapons on Safe while engaging a simulated threat.  Instructors are to stress the importance of not firing the weapon  behind  the  barricade.    If  the  weapon  is  empty,  students  take  cover  as AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   73  appropriate, clear their weapons and follow the instructions from the tower operator.  When reloading or performing immediate actions, students bring the weapon near eye level if necessary to retain  visibility of the target (weapon  may be brought  closer to the body as needed to accomplish these tasks).  This technique ensures the student is not  taking  their  eyes  away  from  the  simulated  threat  until  the  simulated  threat  is eliminated by the “CEASE FIRE” command or the target being turned on edge. 3.11.3.1.10.  Students  have  the  authorized  belt,  holster,  pouch  and  a  minimum  of three magazines.  During the Evaluation, insert the third magazine into the magazine pouch after completion of Evaluation Order number 3. 3.11.3.1.11.  Practice Orders 2-5 and Evaluation Orders 1-6 are fired with 2 shots to the body and 1 shot to the head.  When firing Practice Order 6 and Evaluation Order 7 (all shots are fired into the body), students fire 3 rounds Over Barricade, move to the Kneeling  Barricade  position  and  fire  the  remaining  3  rounds  from  the  Kneeling Barricade position. 3.11.3.1.12.  The  3-shot  strings  (2  shots  to  the  body  and  1  shot  to  the  head)  are designed as a failure drill.   This  technique is  used when the 2 shots to  the body are stopped by body armor and/or do not stop the action that prompted the use of deadly force and the third shot (failure drill) is fired into the unprotected head of the target.  During  the  course  of  fire,  Combat  Arms  will  ensure  students  use  the  following procedures  to  complete  each  order/string  of  fire  that  includes  a  3-shot  failure  drill.  (T-1).  After students fire 2 shots to the body, they pause (1 to 2 seconds) to assess the  target  (with  the  weapon  pointed  at  the  target)  and  then  fire  the  remaining  round into  the  head  of  the  target.    This  technique  is  used  to  train/condition  students  to determine if the threat has been eliminated by the body shots, before firing the head shot.  Students are responsible for pausing between the second and third shot to pass the evaluation on this skill.  Combat Arms personnel will not interfere with students during live-fire,  but  will  enforce  students  pausing  after the two  shots to  the  body to assess the threat before firing the final shot to the head between strings/orders of fire.  (T-1).    In  a  real  life  scenario,  the  time  it  takes  for  a  student  to  move  from  the chest/torso area to the head may be sufficient to determine if a head shot (failure drill) is  needed;  however,  it  is  important  that  they  learn  the  proper  technique.    Note:  Combat  Arms  instructors  emphasize  to  students  that  firing  a  shot  to  the  head  is  not automatic and this method is only used when the 2 shots to the body fail to stop the threat that prompted the use of deadly force. 3.11.3.1.13.  Once the range has been cleared and/or the line has been made safe, the following range commands are used for this course of fire (commands may have to be repeated or modified to ensure everyone understands):  “Shooters with a ____ round magazine  load.    Your  next  order  of  fire  will  be  ____  rounds  fired  from  the  _____ position  within  a  ______  time  limit.    Once  loaded,  holster  your  weapon  or  move  to the  Weaver  Ready  position”  (holstering  the  weapon  or  moving  to  Weaver  Ready depends  on  the  firing  position  used).    Once  loaded,  holstered,  or  at  Weaver  Ready, and  ready  to  fire,  (the  block  officers  point  downrange  to  ensure  the  tower  operator knows the line is ready to fire) the following range commands are used:  “Shooters, this order of fire will be ____ rounds fired from the ____ position.  You’re on duty, standby”  and  after  a  non-standard  pause,  give  the  command  “FIRE”  or  whistle   74  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 (students  must  not  know  when  the  command  fire  or  whistle  will  be  given).    Once firing  has  been  completed  (either  each  string  or  the  course  of  fire)  normal  range commands IAW AFI 36-2654 are used to ensure range safety.  To eliminate the need for fire and cease fire commands, the use of turning targets is recommended. 3.11.3.2.  Practice Order Notes: 3.11.3.2.1.  Before firing Phase I, instructors draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle and a 6-inch (head) circle on the target using chalk or white grease pencil.  The circle is to be  visible  to  the  student  at  all  target  distances.    The  student  uses  the  circle  as  a reference  point  during  practice  fire  to  aid  in  placing  rounds  in  the  vital  area  of  the target.  Center the circle on the target with the top edge of the circle 13 ¼ inches from the  top  of  the  head  of  the  target.    Place  the  top  of  the  6-inch  head  circle  3  inches below the top of the target.  Make the template using plywood, acrylic plastic or other material. 3.11.3.2.2.  Practice Orders 1 and 2, students begin from the Weaver Ready position.  Practice Orders 3 and 4, students begin from the Weaver Ready position behind the barricade.  Practice Orders 5 and 6, students  begin  from the field interview position with  the  handgun  holstered,  holster  retention  secured  and  ammunition  pouches secured.  Practice Order 5 is a repetitious training phase to emphasize the failure drill process.  On Practice Order 6, students fire 3 rounds from the over barricade position (3 shots to the body), move to the kneeling barricade position and fire the remaining 3 rounds  in  the  weapon  (3  shots  to  the  body).    This  reinforces  the  tactic  of  not reappearing in the same spot after a reload.  EXAMPLE:  the over barricade position simulates  firing  over  the  hood  of  a  car  and  the  firing  from  the  kneeling  barricade simulates firing from in front of the headlights. 3.11.3.2.3.  Instructors  teach  students,  as  needed,  during  practice  orders,  correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures if stoppages occur. 3.11.3.2.4.  Before  live  firing,  all  initial  and  Group  B  students  practice  drawing  the handgun  a  minimum  of  10  times  and  dry  firing  from  a  combination  of  the  Weaver stance  and  the  left,  right,  or  over  barricade  positions.    Instructors  provide  sufficient time  to  observe,  coach,  and  evaluate  each  student.    Instructors  observe,  coach  and evaluate each student  prior to  live-fire to  ensure the weapon can  be drawn from the holster safely. 3.11.3.2.5.  Instructors repair or replace all targets after Phase I. 3.11.3.2.6.  To  correct  shooting  errors,  instructors  may  provide  additional  rounds during Phase I. 3.11.3.2.7.  During  Phase  I,  students  clear  their  own  stoppages  under  instructor supervision when the order of fire is completed.  WARNING:    If  a  light  recoil  or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared and before the student continues firing.  (T-1).   AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   75  3.11.3.3. Evaluation Order Notes: 3.11.3.3.1.  Before firing Phase II, instructors draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle and a 6-inch  (head  area)  circle  using  a  pencil  or  pen  so  the  circle  is  not  visible  to  the student, at any distance, during the evaluation.  Use the circles for scoring purposes starting  at  this  point  (all  rounds  in  the  circle  or  touching  the  lines  of  the  circle  are scored as hits).  Give students the opportunity to view their targets at the end of the course  so  they  can  see  if  their  shots  are  in  and  around  the  vital  area  of  the  target.  Instructors  will  remove  all  reference  points  (bullet  holes,  chalk  marks,  etc.)  from evaluation targets that could assist students in identifying the location of the circles, before proceeding with evaluation live-fire.  (T-1). 3.11.3.3.2.  Students begin each order of fire on Evaluation Orders 1, 3 and 7 with the handgun holstered and secured.  Magazine/ammo pouch are fastened on all orders of fire.    Students  place  loaded  spare  magazine  in  ammo  pouch  with  top  of  magazine down into the pouch first and rounds pointed forward.  As a reminder, insert the third magazine into the magazine pouch after completion of Evaluation Order number 3. 3.11.3.3.3.  Students  start  and  finish  each  string  of  fire  in  Evaluation  Orders  2,  4,  5 and  6  from  the  Weaver  Ready  position  behind  the  barricade.    Once  behind  the barricade,  students  remove  their  fingers  from  the  trigger  and  decock  the  weapon.  This technique ensures students are not placing their weapons on Safe while engaging a  simulated  threat.    Note:  Instructors  are  to  stress  the  importance  of  not  firing  the weapon behind the barricade. 3.11.3.3.4.  Students clear their own stoppages during each order of fire  in  Phase II.  Ensure  students  keep  weapons  near  eye  level  (to  ensure  target  stays  in  view)  while clearing  all  malfunctions,  stoppages  or  corrective  actions  (weapons  may  be  brought closer  to  the  body  as  needed  to  accomplish  these  tasks).    Give  pro-rated  time  to complete  the  order  of  fire  if  the  student  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of,  successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage.  The ultimate goal is for the student to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to correct the  problem  and  continue  firing.    WARNING:    If  a  light  recoil  or  difference  in report  is  experienced,  the  instructor  must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire (projectile  not  stuck  in  barrel)  after  the  stoppage  is  cleared  and  before  the student continues firing.  (T-1). 3.11.3.3.5.  Instructors  do  not  teach  during  the  evaluation  orders  of  fire.    However, they  may  assist students  and  teach  shooting  fundamentals  between  the actual  orders of  fire.    They  also  correct  safety  infractions  and  supervise  how  students  apply immediate action procedures when applicable. 3.11.3.3.6.  When  students  are  ready  to  fire  the  first  string  of  the  evaluation  phase, they  are  given  the  command  to  load.    This  is  the  only  time  the  students  are  told  to load  for  the  remainder  of  the  evaluation  phase.    From  this  point,  students automatically  reload  when  their  weapon  is  empty  and  the  slide  locks  to  the  rear.  Students  are  clearly  informed  of  the  number  of  rounds  fired  during  each  string,  as they  are  likely  to  have  more  rounds  in  the  magazine  than  they  need  for  the string/order of fire.  This technique allows the student to automatically reload without being told.  This simulates a “real world” situation.   76  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 3.11.3.3.7.  On  evaluation  order  7,  students  fire  3  rounds  from  the  over  barricade position  (3  shots  to  the  body),  move  to  the  kneeling  barricade  position  and  fire  the remaining 3 rounds in the weapon (3 shots to the body).  This simulates a reload as in Practice  Order  number  6.    This  reinforces  the  tactic  of  not  reappearing  in  the  same spot after a reload.   EXAMPLE:   The over barricade position  simulates firing over the  hood  of  a  car  and  the  reload  and  firing  from  the  kneeling  barricade  simulates firing  from  in  front  of  the  headlights.    Note:  Students  may  not  fire  any  shots  to  the head at 25-meter targets. 3.11.3.4.  Positions: 3.11.3.4.1.  Weaver  Stance.    Use  the  Weaver  stance  when  firing  from  cover  is  not possible.  The  Weaver  stance  affords the student  a basic stable  firing position using less body movement than previous positions.  It allows quicker target acquisition and increases speed and accuracy.  To assume the Weaver stance, take a standing position facing the target with the feet shoulder width apart, step back with the strong side foot about 5 to  8  inches,  and pivot on the balls  of your  feet 45 degrees to the weak side (very similar to a boxer’s stance).  Bring weapon to eye level; do not lower head to weapon.    This  position  may  be  modified  to  make  maximum  use  of  body  armor.  Extend  the shooting  arm  toward  the  target,  do not  lock  elbow.    Wrap  fingers  of  the support hand around (overlapping) fingers of the shooting hand (forefinger of support hand may be placed on concave forward surface of the trigger guard).  Keep support arm  bent,  elbow  pointing  toward  the  ground.    Apply  forward  pressure  with  the shooting arm and at the same time, apply equal pressure to the rear with the support arm.  This helps steady the handgun.  Lift head slightly for better sighting.  Keep both eyes open if possible. 3.11.3.4.2.  Weaver  Ready  Position.    With  the  student  in  the  Weaver  stance,  the student lowers the weapon so the entire target is visible.  This lowered position may be  nothing  more  than  a  3  to  4  inch  drop  below  eye  level.    Lower  the  weapon  by pivoting at the shoulder, do not bend at the elbows or tuck the weapon into the chest to  lower  the  handgun.    Students  should  not  raise  and  lower  their  heads  to  meet  the intent  of  this  requirement.    Keep  the  weapon  pointed  down  range  and  maintain  eye contact with the target. 3.11.3.4.3.  Strong  Side/Support  Side  Barricade  Positions.    The  primary  purpose  of using  a  barricade  is  to  provide  cover  for  the  student.    The  student  starts  from  the Weaver  Ready  position,  behind  the  barricade,  with  the  muzzle  of  the  handgun approximately  1  inch  behind  the  barricade.    When  engaging  the  target,  the  student rolls out (lean) to the strong/support side and engages the target (ensure the weapon is clear  of  the  barricade  to  prevent  rounds  from  being  fired  into  the  barricade).    The student does not lean forward or extend the handgun beyond the rear of the barricade.  After firing, the student rolls back behind the barricade, takes their finger off trigger, decocks and again assumes the Weaver Ready position.  Reloading is also conducted behind the barricade.  The student will not use the barricade for support and will not allow  any  portion  of  the  weapon  to  touch  the  barricade.    (T-1).    The  student  may switch hands on the support side barricade position, but they must accomplish this at the Weaver Ready and before live-fire begins.  (T-1).  Note:  During classroom and dry-fire  training,  students  should  be  taught  the  “slice  the  pie”  method  of  target AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   77  engagement.  Students should not step/lean forward or extend the handgun forward of the barricade.  The concept is for the student to roll to the right or left, locate/identify the threat, rapidly engage the threat and return to cover. 3.11.3.4.4.  Over Barricade Position.  This is a variation of the standing position with the addition of a barricade for stability and protection.  The barricade simulates a tall fence, wall or solid object, giving protection to the student.  To assume this position, place the weak foot forward towards the barricade, bend the forward knee, and move the strong foot back until only the head and weapon are visible above the barricade.  Rest the forearms (behind wrists, or heels of the hands) on the barricade.  The height of the over barricade position is no higher than necessary to see and shoot over your barricade.    Don't  allow  any  part  of  the  handgun  or  magazine  to  touch  the  support.  Reloading the  barricade.  WARNING:    Resting  wrists  or  heels  of  hands  on  barricade  could  result  in painful pinching to the student’s hands during recoil. is  accomplished  while  kneeling  concealed  behind 3.11.3.4.5.  Kneeling Barricade Position.  The primary purpose of using a barricade is to  provide  cover  for  the  student.    The  kneeling  barricade  provides  stability  while giving protection to the student.  To assume this position, place the weak foot forward towards  the  barricade,  bend  the  forward  knee,  and  move  the  strong  foot  back  and place  the  knee  on  the  ground.    Rest  the  weak  elbow  just  forward  of  the  kneecap.  Don't allow any part of the handgun to touch the support.  Reloading is accomplished while  concealed  behind  the  barricade.    The  same  concepts  as  those  in  the  strong side/support side barricade positions apply to this position.   78  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 Figure 3.1.  Circle Template for Handgun Targets.   3.11.4.  Circle  Template:  The  template  in  Figure  3.2  is  used  to  mark  each  target  for  the practice  and  qualification  courses  of  fire.    Instructors  ensure  the  circles  are  visible  at  all distances  during  practice  by  using  white  chalk  or  white  grease  pencil  to  make  the  circles.  During the evaluation portion, the circles should not be visible at any distance.  Use a lead pencil  to  ensure  the  circles  are  not  visible.    The  6-inch  circle  (Incapacitation  Zone) encompasses  the  typical  area  for  the  student  to  achieve  hits  in  the  brainstem  (medulla oblongata)  and  the  10-inch  circle  (Lethal  Zone)  represents  the  thoracic  cavity  area,  which includes the lungs, middle/lower airways, heart and major vessels/arteries.  Instructors should emphasize to students that these are the areas of the human target where they can achieve the highest probability of rapid incapacitation.   Note:  Combat Arms may use targets with pre-printed circles that have been approved by AFSFC/FGWL.  These type targets are available from some civilian target manufacturers. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   79  Chapter 4 HANDGUN BASIC ARMS TRAINING (BAT) COURSE TRAINING PROGRAM 4.1.  Basic  Arms  Training  (BAT)  Course:  This  course  provides  Air  Force  Office  of  Special Investigations (AFOSI) agents and others specified in AFI 36-2654 with the minimum training, tactics, techniques and procedures and evaluation required for qualification with a handgun. 4.2.  Training Overview. 4.2.1.  Initial Training.  This is the student's first participation in this training program.  Initial training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  performance  evaluations,  qualifying  on  the handgun BAT course of fire  and passing all training  objectives listed in  Table  4.1  AFOSI agents  complete  initial  training  on  the  BAT  course  at  the  U.S.  Air  Force  Special Investigations Academy (USAFSIA). 4.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the BAT course of fire and passing mechanical  evaluations.    Frequency  of  this  training  is  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Weapons safety procedures and the training objectives in Table 4.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training.  Additionally, students must meet the training objectives for the Handgun AFQC listed in Chapter 3.  (T-1). 4.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 4.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and recurring training. 4.2.5.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by unit to  help  maintain  the  individual's  proficiency.    Units  should  conduct  this  training  before exercises and deployments. 4.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 4.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 4.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. 4.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator   80  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 4.4.  Handgun  BAT  Course  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following paragraphs  is  intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for initial and recurring training.  Students must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of the training objectives listed in Table 4.1  (T-1).  Note:  Training times may vary depending on class size, student experience level, range location, etc.  Approximate training times for this program are: 4.4.1.  For BAT Course – 3.5 to 5 hours. 4.4.2.  For remedial and unit training – as required. 4.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to use the handgun for personal defense and law enforcement missions. 4.6.  Training  Objectives  BAT  Course.  Training  objectives  for  successful  completion  of  this course are found in Table 4.1 and the Handgun AFQC listed in Chapter 3. 4.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 4.6.1.1.  Safety procedures.  (T-1). 4.6.1.2.  Characteristics, nomenclature and general data.  (T-1). 4.6.1.3.

Course Information, Handgun Basic Arms Training (BAT) Course. 4.9.1.  Targets for the course:  If available use of the Denver Police Training Target (DPTT) with a head target of approximately 4 inches, a center mass target of approximately 11 inches by 8 inches and a pelvic girdle of approximately 5 inches by 13 inches as indicated at Figure 4.1    Until  these  targets  are  available  or  if  they  become  unavailable,  use  the  Military  "E" target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874) and/or Military "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) modified as outlined in paragraph 4.9.1.1 and Figure 4.2  Targets may need to be hung lower to avoid shooting overhead baffles and/or target holders.  Note:  The supported AFOSI detachment is responsible for obtaining the DPTT and providing them to Combat Arms.  (T-2). 4.9.1.1.  Modify  the  Military  "E"  target  or  Military  "E"  target  backer  as  follows.    The circles drawn on the Military “E” target/backer are in chalk or a visible white marking.  A 10-inch circle is drawn at the top of the target and centered with the top edge of the circle 13 ¼ inches from the top edge of target.  In addition to the 10-inch circle, draw three 6-inch  circles  on  the  target.    The  first  6-inch  circle  is  located  approximately  3  ¾  inches from the top edge of the head of the target (facial area).  The remaining two 6-inch circles are located as follows: one in the lower right pelvic region area and one in the lower left pelvic  region  area  (circles  in  bottom  right  and  bottom  left  corners  of  the  target)  as   86  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 indicated  in  Figure  4.2.    Combat  Arms  may  wish  to  prepare  templates  to  simplify  the target modification process. 4.9.2.  Evaluation Standards: 4.9.2.1.  Qualified:  30 hits inside circle areas (60%). 4.9.2.2.  Expert:  45 hits inside or touching the line of the circle areas (90%). 4.9.2.3.  The  below  paragraphs  identify  the  maximum  number  of  hits  allowed  in  each target area.  Instructors score any excessive hits in any of the target areas as misses. 4.9.2.3.1.  Thoracic Cavity (Center Circle) - 44. 4.9.2.3.2.  Head - 2 (only shots fired in Order 4 are counted). 4.9.2.3.3.  Pelvic Girdle - 4 (only shots fired in Order 6 are counted). 4.9.2.3.4.  Bullet holes that touch the line of the circle are counted as a hit. 4.9.3.  Course Notes: 4.9.3.1.  Common Notes: 4.9.3.1.1.  WARNING:  Range personnel closely observe students during dry-fire and live-fire to ensure they properly control their weapon and do not allow the muzzle  to  point  at  themselves,  other  students  or  in  any  unsafe  direction.    Any students who cannot safely perform all tasks will not be allowed to complete live-fire.  (T-1). 4.9.3.1.2.  There  is  no  zeroing  or  practice  order;  however,  instructors  check  bullet impact  and  discuss  the  adjusted  aiming  point  method  if  the  point  of  impact  is substantially  off  the  vital  area  of  the  target  and  is  not  caused  by  shooter  error,  e.g.,  jerking the trigger, flinching, etc. 4.9.3.1.3.  Start  each  order  or  string  of  fire  with  a  round  in  the  chamber  and  the hammer  decocked  (in  forward/down  position).    Students  fire  the  first  round  in  each order or string of fire from double action.  To ensure consistency, the “Field Interview Stance” (placing hands in belt buckle area) is only used as a starting point (to ensure consistency) for each student prior to drawing the weapon from the holster. 4.9.3.1.4.  Students wear a jacket concealing the holstered weapon.  Drawing from a concealed carry is mandatory. 4.9.3.1.5.  This  course  is  specifically  designed  for  a  student  utilizing  a  belt  holster.  This course is just as effective for students using an approved “cross-draw” shoulder holster providing they undergo extensive practice with their shoulder holster (AFOSI personnel  transitioning  from  a  belt  holster  to  a  shoulder  holster  must  meet  the requirements  outlined  in  AFOSIMAN  71-113,  Firearms,  Use  of  Force  and Apprehension Tactics). 4.9.3.1.5.1.  Individuals  authorized  to  use  an  approved  “cross-draw”  shoulder holster  are  not  allowed  to  fire  with  students  using  “normal”  hip  type  holsters.  When  firing  with  shoulder  holsters,  individuals  are  positioned  on  every  other firing point. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   87  4.9.3.1.6.  Local  AFOSI  detachments  provide  Combat  Arms  personnel  AFOSI authorized  holsters,  magazine  pouches,  and  weapons  as  needed  to  allow  Combat Arms personnel to accomplish OJT training and qualification on the course of fire. 4.9.3.1.6.1.  All  specialized  targets  required  for  completion  of  this  course  of  fire are  provided  by  the  local  AFOSI  detachment.    Combat  Arms  is  not  required  to purchase these targets.  The Combat Arms organization provides the Military “E” targets. 4.9.3.1.7.  CAUTION:  To  prevent  injury  to  personnel  and/or  damage  to  materials, range  officials  will  intercede  if  students  advertently  or  inadvertently  perform  any actions  that  could  endanger  themselves  or  others  or  that  may  cause  damage  to  the weapon or facilities.  (T-1). 4.9.3.1.7.1.  Range personnel must double-check target placement from all firing positions to ensure that no damage to the facility or safety hazards will result from firing this course of fire as written.  (T-1).  Deviations from the course of fire are approved by USAFSIA/FT and HQ USAF/A4SX. 4.9.3.1.8.  WARNING:  Combat  Arms  personnel  must  visually inspect  all weapons,  magazines  and  magazine  pouches  at  the  end  of  live-fire  training  to ensure  they  do  not  contain  live  rounds.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  personnel  will make  all  weapons  rack  safe,  as  defined  in  AFMAN  31-129,  prior  to  removal from the firing line (students may transport weapons in their holsters once made rack safe).  (T-1). 4.9.3.2.  Notes for all orders/strings of fire: 4.9.3.2.1.  Unless the weapon is empty, once a student has completed an order/string of  fire,  the  student  remains  on  target  and  continues  to  scan  until  the  command “CEASE  FIRE”  has  been  given  or  when  the  target  is  turned  on  edge.    Once  the command  “CEASE  FIRE”  has  been  given,  or  the  target  turns  on  edge,  students remain on target until the tower operator gives the command “ASSESS.”  Upon the command,  students  assume  the  ready  position.   Once  at  the ready  position,  students automatically  decock  the  weapon  and  remain  in  this  position  looking  at  the  target until  the  command  “SWEEP”  has  been  given.    Students  rotate  at  the  hips  sweeping side  to  side  simulating  a  search  for  additional  targets.    Upon  the  command “HOLSTER,”  students  then  return  the  weapon  to  their  holster  and  secure  with retention  device  (e.g.,  thumb  break,  loop,  flap).    This  technique  ensures  students  do not automatically take their weapons off target and holster without first ensuring the threat is eliminated.  If the weapon is empty, students take cover as appropriate, clear their weapons and follow the instructions from the tower operator.  When reloading or  performing  immediate  action,  students  bring  the  weapon  near  eye  level  (weapon may  be  brought  closer  to  the  body  as  needed  to  accomplish  these  tasks).    After reloading  or  completing  immediate  action,  the  student  places  the  sights  back  on  the target  and  follows  the  procedures  at  the  beginning  of  this  paragraph.    These techniques ensure the student is not taking their eyes away from the simulated threat until the simulated threat is eliminated indicated by the “HOLSTER” command or the target being turned on edge.   88  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 4.9.3.2.2.  Students  holster  their  weapon  without  looking  at  the  holster;  they  should focus  their  view  on  the  target  while  they  are  holstering  (during  support  hand  firing, students may glance quickly at holster during reloading).  WARNING:  Instructors will ensure that students do not point the muzzle of their weapon at themselves, other  personnel  or  in  any  unsafe  direction  when  returning  the  handgun  to  the holster.    (T-1).    Instructors  need  to  be  extremely  observant  to  ensure  students have decocked (lowered hammer to forward/down position) their weapon and do not  place  their  finger  inside  the  trigger  guard  before/during  returning  the handgun to the holster. 4.9.3.2.3.  Students  have  a  jacket,  an  authorized  holster,  a  magazine  pouch  and  a minimum of two magazines. 4.9.3.2.4.  Instructors evaluate students on their ability to safety perform all skills in the classroom before proceeding to live-fire. 4.9.3.2.5.  Failure Drills (head):  This technique is used when the 2 shots to the body are  stopped  by  body  armor  and/or  do  not  stop  the  action  that  prompted  the  use  of deadly force and the third shot (failure drill) is fired into the unprotected head of the target.  During the course of fire, Combat Arms will ensure students use the following procedures  to  complete  each  order/string  of  fire  that  includes  a  3-shot  failure  drill.  (T-1).  After students fire 2 shots to the body, they pause (1 to 2 seconds) to assess the  target  (with  the  weapon  pointed  at  the  target)  and  then  fire  the  remaining  round into  the  head  of  the  target.    This  technique  is  used  to  train/condition  students  to determine if the threat has been eliminated by the body shots, before firing the head shot.  Students are responsible for pausing between the second and third shot to pass the evaluation on this skill.  Combat Arms personnel will not interfere with students during live-fire,  but  will  enforce  students  pausing  after the two  shots to  the  body to assess the threat before firing the final shot.to the head between strings/orders of fire.  (T-1).    In  a  real  life  scenario,  the  time  it  takes  for  a  student  to  move  from  the chest/torso area to the head may be sufficient to determine if a head shot (failure drill) is  needed;  however,  it  is  important  that  they  learn  the  proper  technique.    Note:  Combat  Arms  instructors  emphasize  to  students  that  firing  a  shot  to  the  head  is  not automatic and this method is only used when the 2 shots to the body fail to stop the threat that prompted the use of deadly force. 4.9.3.2.6.  Failure Drills (pelvis):  This technique is used when the 2 shots to the body are stopped by body armor and the third and fourth shots (failure drills) are fired into the  unprotected  pelvic  girdle  of  the  target.    Shooters  and  instructors  use  the  same procedures outlined in paragraph 4.9.3.2.5. for failure drills to the head of the target. 4.9.3.2.7.  Once the range bay has been cleared and students are at the firing line with all needed equipment and loaded magazines, the following range commands are used for  this  course  of  fire  (commands  may  have  to  be  repeated/  modified  to  ensure everyone  understands).    “Shooters  with  a  ____  round  magazine,  load.    Your  next order of fire will be ____ rounds fired from the _____ position within a ______ time limit.    Once  loaded,  holster  and  secure  your  weapon  and  move  to  the  interview stance.”    Once  all  students  are  loaded,  weapons  holstered  and  they  are ready  to  fire (the block officers will point downrange to ensure the tower operator knows the line AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   89  is  ready  to  fire  without  verbal  commands),  the  tower  operator  uses  the  following range  commands:    “Shooters,  this  order  of  fire  will  be  ____  rounds  fired  from  the ____  position.    “You’re  on  duty,  standby.”    After  a  non-standard  pause,  the  tower operator  gives  the  command  “Fire”  or  uses  a  signal  (e.g.,  whistle  or  buzzer).    The students  should  not  know  when  the  tower  operator  is  to  give  the  fire  command  or signal,  but  they  need  to  know  what  the  command  or  signal  will  be.    The  tower operator  will  not  use  the  standard  commands  of  “Is  the  line  ready”  or  “The  line  is ready.”  (T-1).  Students and instructors follow the procedures in paragraph 4.9.3.2.1 at  the  completion  of  each  order  or  string  of  fire.    Once  firing  has  been  completed (either each order, string of fire or the entire course of fire) normal range commands IAW AFI 36-2654 are used to ensure range safety.  To eliminate the need for fire and cease fire commands, the use of turning targets is recommended. 4.9.3.2.8.  Students load their magazines with the following rounds and in this order for  the  course  of  fire:    13-13-13-11.    Students  reload  empty  magazines  when necessary,  between  orders  of  fire  and  place  the  reload  magazines  in  their  magazine pouch.    Students  reload  their  weapon  automatically  when  it  is  empty  and  without command from the tower operator or other instructors. 4.9.3.2.9.  Students  begin  each  order  of  fire  with  the  handgun  holstered  and  the securing device fastened.  The magazine/ammo pouch is fastened on all orders of fire.  Shooters  place  the  loaded  spare  magazine  in  the  ammo  pouch  with  the  top  of  the magazine (exposed rounds) facing down into the pouch and the bullets of the rounds pointed forward. 4.9.3.2.10.  Students clear their own stoppages throughout the course of fire.  Ensure students keep weapons near eye level (to ensure target stays in view) while clearing all malfunctions, stoppages or corrective actions (weapons may be brought closer to the body as needed to accomplish these tasks).  Give pro-rated time to complete the order  of  fire  if  the  student  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of,  successfully  applying immediate  or  remedial  action  to  clear  the  stoppage.    The  ultimate  goal  is  for  the student to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to correct the problem and continue firing.  WARNING:  If a light recoil or difference in report is  experienced,  the  instructor  must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile not  stuck  in  barrel)  after  the  stoppage  is  cleared  and  before  the  student continues firing.  (T-1).  The tower operator will ensure students are briefed on these procedures before beginning live-fire.  (T-1). 4.9.3.3.  Firing Order Specific Notes. 4.9.3.3.1.  Order 1, Close Quarter Battle:  This order of fire evaluates the student’s proficiency  at  engaging  a  threat  at  extremely  close  range  without  using  sights  or extending  the  arms.    With  targets  placed  at  1  meter  from  the  firing  line,  on  the  fire command  or  signal,  students  draw  their  weapon  and  fire  3  rounds  into  the  center circle of the target with a 3-second time limit. 4.9.3.3.1.1.  After  recovering  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.9.3.2.1., students repeat this string of fire at the tower operator’s command. 4.9.3.3.1.2.  Students fire using their strong hand only.   90  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 4.9.3.3.1.3.  Students  fire  using  a  close  quarters  bent  elbow  position,  with  the strong hand only.  Students place their support hand on their chest after drawing the weapon to prevent accidentally discharging the weapon into their hand or arm.  Instructors emphasize that this is for safety during live-fire training only and in a real-world situation; they should use their support hand/arm to block the threat or create/maintain  distance  from  the  threat.    Students  fire  using  the  following guidance for their shooting position: 4.9.3.3.1.3.1.  The elbow of the shooting arm is bent and locked into the body just above the holster, with the wrist of the firing hand locked to eliminate flip and to maintain control of the weapon. 4.9.3.3.1.3.2.  The  student  should  cant  the  weapon  outward  to  prevent  the slide from striking their body during recoil. 4.9.3.3.1.4.  Combat Arms sections that cannot place the target at 1 meter or move shooters  downrange  to  a  position  1  meter  from  the  target  for  safety  or  range design  reasons,  may  request  permission  from  AFSFC/FGWL  to  complete  this order  of  fire  with  the  target  at  the  closest  safe  distance,  not  to  exceed  7  meters from the firing line.  AFSFC/FGWL notifies HQ USAF/A4SX of this deviation. 4.9.3.3.2.  Order  2,  Double  Tap:  This  order  of  fire  evaluates  the  student’s proficiency at engaging a close range threat with two rapid-fired shots.  With targets placed at 7 meters from the firing line, on the fire command or signal, shooters draw their weapon and fire 2 rounds into the center circle of the target with a 4-second time limit. 4.9.3.3.2.1.  After  recovering  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.9.3.2.1., students repeat this string of fire at the tower operator’s command. 4.9.3.3.2.2.  Students fire using a two-hand grip. 4.9.3.3.3.  Order  3,  Double  Tap  with  Reload:  This  order  of  fire  evaluates  the student’s proficiency at engaging a close range threat with two rapid-fired shots with the need to reload between shots.  With targets placed at 7 meters from the firing line, on the fire command or signal, students draw their weapon and fire 2 rounds into the center circle of the target with a 10-second time limit.  Students reload after the first shot, then place their sights back on the target and fire the second shot. 4.9.3.3.3.1.  The  tower  operator  and  instructors  will  not  inform  the  students  that they need to reload after the first shot.  (T-1). 4.9.3.3.3.2.  Students fire using a two-hand grip. 4.9.3.3.4.  Order 4, Failure Drills (Head):  This order of fire evaluates the student’s ability to engage the threat with two rapid-fired shots to the thoracic cavity and then transition to a single shot to the cranial vault (head) when the threat is not eliminated.  With the target placed at 7 meters from the firing line, on the fire command or signal, shooters draw their weapon, fire 2 rounds into the center circle of the target, transition their  aiming  point  to  the  circle  in  the  head  of  the  target,  assess  the threat  and  fire  1 round into the head, with a 7-second time limit to fire all 3 rounds. 4.9.3.3.4.1.  After  recovering  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.9.3.2.1., AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   91  students repeat this string of fire at the tower operator’s command. 4.9.3.3.4.2.  Students fire using a two-hand grip. 4.9.3.3.4.3.  Instructors only score hits in the prescribed target locations. 4.9.3.3.4.4.  Note:  Instructors stress that failure drills are only utilized if the agent determines that the double tap to the thoracic cavity (center of mass) failed to stop the action.  Failure drills are not designed to replace the approved center of mass firing.  Shooters pause after the double tap and analyze the threat to determine if the  action  that  prompted  deadly  force  has  been  stopped  by  the  thoracic  cavity shots. 4.9.3.3.5.  Order 5, Support Hand with Reload:  This order evaluates the student’s ability to draw and engage the target with the support hand only.  This order simulates the student losing use of their strong hand (e.g., being shot in the strong hand or arm).  With the target placed at 7 meters from the firing line, on the fire command or signal, students  draw  their  weapon  with  the  support  hand  only  and  fire  6  rounds  into  the center circle of the target, with a 14-second time limit to fire all 6 rounds.  Students need to reload after firing all 6 rounds. 4.9.3.3.5.1.  Students  fire  using  the  support  hand  only.    Students  secure  their strong hand tucked in their beltline, in front or behind themselves.  The intent is to simulate an injured and unusable limb.  The strong arm/hand may not be used for any function during this order. 4.9.3.3.5.2.  Instructors must closely observe students during this order to ensure they  properly  control  their  weapon  and  do  not  allow  the  muzzle  to  point  at themselves, other personnel or in any unsafe direction.  (T-1). 4.9.3.3.5.3.  The  tower  operator  and  instructors  do  not  inform  the  students  that they  need  to  reload  after  firing  all  6  rounds.    Students  reload  with  the  support hand only and return their sights to the target after reloading. 4.9.3.3.5.4.  Students  use  two  hands  to  recover  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in paragraph 4.9.3.2.1. 4.9.3.3.6.  Order 6, Failure Drills (Pelvis):  This order of fire evaluates the student’s ability to engage the threat with two rapid-fired shots to the thoracic cavity and then transition  to  2  shots  to  the  pelvic  area  when  the  threat  is  not  eliminated.    With  the target placed at 7 meters from the firing line, on the fire command or signal, students draw  their  weapon,  fire  2  rounds  into  the  center  circle  of  the  target,  transition  their aiming point to the left or right circle in the pelvic area of the target, assess the threat and  fire  2  rounds  into  the  pelvic  circles  (left  side  or  right  side  or  both),  with  an  8-second time limit to fire all 4 rounds. 4.9.3.3.6.1.  After  recovering  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.9.3.2.1., students repeat this string of fire at the tower operator’s command. 4.9.3.3.6.2.  Students fire using a two-hand grip. 4.9.3.3.6.3.  Instructors only score hits in the prescribed target locations. 4.9.3.3.6.4.  Note:  Instructors stress that failure drills are only utilized if the agent   92  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 determines that the double tap to the thoracic cavity (center of mass) failed to stop the action.  Failure drills are not designed to replace the approved center of mass firing.  Students pause after the double tap and analyze the threat to determine if the  action  that  prompted  deadly  force  has  been  stopped  by  the  thoracic  cavity shots before firing shots into the pelvis. 4.9.3.3.7.  Order  7,  Strong  Hand  with  Reload:  This  order  evaluates  the  student’s ability to draw and engage the target with the strong hand only.  This order simulates the  student  losing  use  of  their  support  hand  (e.g.,  being  shot  in  the  support  hand  or arm).  With the target placed at 7 meters from the firing line, on the fire command or signal,  students  draw  their  weapon with  the  strong  hand  only  and  fire  6  rounds into the  center  circle  of  the  target,  with  a  20-second  time  limit  to  fire  all  6  rounds including a reload.  Students need to reload after firing 5 rounds. 4.9.3.3.7.1.  Students  fire  using  the  strong  hand  only.    Students  secure  their support hand tucked in their beltline, in front or behind themselves.  The intent is to simulate an injured and unusable limb.  The support arm/hand may not be used for any function during this order. 4.9.3.3.7.2.  Instructors must closely observe students during this order to ensure they  properly  control  their  weapon  and  do  not  allow  the  muzzle  to  point  at themselves, other personnel or in any unsafe direction.  (T-1). 4.9.3.3.7.3.  The  tower  operator  and  instructors  do  not  inform  the  students  that they  need  to  reload  after  firing  5  rounds.    Students  reload  with  the  strong  hand only, return their sights to the target after reloading and fire the sixth round. 4.9.3.3.7.4.  Students  use  two  hands  to  recover  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in paragraph 4.9.3.2.1. 4.9.3.3.8.  Order  8,  Multiple  Threats:  This  order  evaluates  the  shooter’s  ability to effectively engage multiple threats at different distances.  With a single target placed at 7 meters and another single target placed at 15 meters from the firing line, on the fire  command  or  signal,  shooters  draw  their  weapon  and  engage  the  closest  target with 1 shot to the center circle, then engage the 15-meter target with a 2 shot pair to the center circle and finally return to the closest target with 1 shot to the center circle for 4 shots total with an 8-second time limit to fire all 4 rounds. 4.9.3.3.8.1.  After  recovering  to  the  holster  as  outlined  in  paragraph  4.9.3.2.1., students repeat this string of fire at the tower operator’s command. 4.9.3.3.8.2.  Students fire using a two-hand grip. 4.9.3.3.8.3.  Targets are set at the 7 meter line and the 15 meter line on adjacent firing points.  In this configuration every other student fires, for example all odd numbered  firing  points  fire,  then  all  even  numbered  firing  points.    Instructors score targets between relays. 4.9.3.3.8.4.  WARNING:  Instructors  must  ensure  targets  are  positioned  to prevent shooters from firing into walls, the ceiling, baffles, outside the range limits  or  other  structures  creating  potential  safety  hazards.    (T-1).    Range personnel will closely observe shooters to ensure they properly control their AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   93  weapons and do not allow the muzzle to point at themselves or in any unsafe direction.  (T-1). 4.9.3.3.8.5.  Combat  Arms  sections  that  cannot  position  multiple  targets  as prescribed  in  paragraph  4.9.3.3.8.3  due  to  safety  or  range  design  reasons,  may request  permission  from  AFSFC/FGWL  to  complete  this  order  of  fire  with  a single target.  AFSFC/FGWL notifies HQ USAF/A4SX of this deviation. target  at  7  meters  using  multiple  circles  on the  single 4.9.3.3.9.  Order  9,  Contact  Drills:  This  order  evaluates  the  student’s  ability  to correctly  identify  and  engage  targets  at  different  ranges.    The  tower  operator identifies a target to the students by using the command, “GUN, TARGET ___.”  For example, on the command “GUN, TARGET TWO” the students identify and engage the target numbered two (2) with a double tap in the center circle of the target. 4.9.3.3.9.1.  Students fire using a two-hand grip. 4.9.3.3.9.2.  Students  fire  at  the  targets  used  for  Order  8  and  in  the  same configuration.    Instructors  should  clearly  identify  the  targets  by  placing  a  large number “1” in the head of the 7-meter target and a large number “2” in the head of  the  15-meter  target  with  chalk.    Again,  every  other  shooter  fires  the  order; instructors  score  and  mark  their  hits  and  the  remaining  students  then  fire  at  the same targets. 4.9.3.3.9.3.  If Combat Arms has received approval to use a single target for Order 8, they can use the target prescribed in Chapter 2, Figure 2.2 for this order.  The tower operator calls out the number of the circle for students to engage as outlined in paragraph 4.9.3.3.9. 4.9.3.3.9.4.  Instructors  only  score  hits  in  the  targets  identified  by  the  tower operator during firing.   94  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 Figure 4.1.  Denver Police Training Target Figure 4.2.  Modified Military “E” Target   AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   95  Chapter 5 SHOTGUN TRAINING PROGRAM 5.1.  Shotgun  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the  minimum  training; weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship  skills  and performance  evaluations  required  for  qualification  with  a  shotgun.    Personnel  who  live-fire qualify  on  one  type  of  shotgun  may  carry  another  shotgun  type  once  they  have  successfully completed  mechanical  training  and  performance  evaluations  conducted  by  Combat  Arms.    See AFI 36-2654 for additional guidance. 5.2.  Training Overview. 5.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student's  first  participation  in  the  shotgun  training program.  Initial training consists of classroom instruction, performance evaluations, passing all training objectives in Table 5.1 and qualifying on the shotgun AFQC. 5.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  shotgun  AFQC  and  passing mechanical evaluations.  The required frequencies for recurring training and qualification are outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Weapons  safety  procedures  and  the  training  objectives  in  Table 5.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training. 5.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 5.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and recurring training. 5.2.5.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by unit to  help  maintain  the  individual's  proficiency.    Units  should  conduct  this  training  before exercises and deployments. 5.2.6.  Non-Lethal Training.  Personnel identified by their unit commander or a deployment tasking to be armed with non-lethal munitions must initially qualify on Phase I and II of the AFQC and then fire the non-lethal phases and orders outlined in Table 5.2  (T-1).  Students who have been designated to fire the non-lethal phases of AFQC should fire all portions in one day.  If not all training and orders of fire are accomplished in one day, students receive a refresher  class  on  the  mechanical  portions  of  the  weapon.    Students  wear  issued  ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), and gas mask carrier, with  gas  mask  and  protective  gloves,  during  all  the  non-lethal  phases  of  fire.    Non-lethal qualification  training  is  documented  as  a  separate  qualification  in  SFMIS  and  on  the individual’s AF Form 522 and expires on the original AFQC (Phase I and II) expiration date.  Enter non-lethal qualification as “AFQC N/L” in the course block.  Annotate the type non-lethal round(s) the individual qualified with in the Remarks section of the AF Form 522.  It is not  a  requirement  for  Combat  Arms  personnel  to  attend  the  Inner  Service  Non-lethal Individual Weapon Instructor Course (INIWIC); therefore, Combat Arms instructors are only   96  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 required  to  be  certified  and  qualify  with  the  non-lethal  ammunition  in  order  to  conduct training. 5.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 5.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 5.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. 5.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 5.4.  Shotgun  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following  paragraphs  is intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for  initial  and recurring training.  Students must meet and pass evaluations to the performance standards of the training  objectives  listed  in  Table  5.1    (T-1).    Note:    Training  times  may  vary  depending  on class  size,  student  experience  level,  range  location,  etc.    Approximate  training  times  for  this program are: 5.4.1.  For AFQC – 4 to 5 hours. 5.4.2.  For remedial and unit training – as required. 5.5.  Training Goal.  Training goal is to instill confidence in the student to develop and maintain the capability to use the shotgun against enemy targets and lightweight materials. 5.6.  Training  Objectives  AFQC.  The training objectives needed for successful completion of this course are found in Table 5.1 5.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 5.6.1.1.

For  non-lethal phases, draw a chalk line across the width of the target, 13 inches down from the top of the  head  of  the  target  and  parallel  to  the  bottom  of  the  target  (see  Figure  5.1).    Hits  on  or above the line are counted as misses during non-lethal phases.  Note:  Targets for non-lethal phases are placed 10 meters/yards from the firing line. 5.9.2.  Evaluation Standards: 5.9.2.1.  Phase II – Qualified:  25 hits out of a possible score of 45. 5.9.2.2.  Phase  IV  (M-1013,  12  gauge,  Crowd  Dispersal  Cartridge)  -  Qualified:    63  hits out of a possible 90.  Hits in the head or neck are considered a miss.  Mark as qualified or unqualified on the AF Form 522 and AF Form 710 in SFMIS. 5.9.2.3.  Phase IV (M-1012, 12 gauge, Fin-Stabilized Cartridge) - Qualified:  3 hits out of a  possible  5.    Hits  in  the  head  or  neck  are  considered  a  miss.    Mark  as  qualified  or unqualified on the AF Form 522 and AF Form 710 in SFMIS. 5.9.3.  Course Notes: 5.9.3.1.  During  training,  shotguns  may  be  equipped  with  removable  (slide  on)  recoil pads. 5.9.3.2.  Before  live  firing,  students  are  given  an  opportunity  to  practice  assuming  each position and establishing proper grip/technique.  Afford sufficient time for instructors to observe, coach and evaluate each student.  This may be accomplished on the firing line prior to firing Phase I or in the classroom during the second period. 5.9.3.3.  Conduct  all  firing  on  Phases  I  and  II  with  "00"  buckshot  or  frangible ammunition (9 pellets).  Conduct all firing on Phases III and IV with the type(s) of non-lethal round(s) with which the shooters are to be armed. 5.9.3.4.  Instructors teach students, as needed, during practice orders.  Instructors correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures if stoppages occur. 5.9.3.5.  Start  standing  orders  of  fire  with  the  shotgun  at  a  low  ready  position  and  the safety on. 5.9.3.6.  The shotgun is not to touch or rest on the barricade. 5.9.3.7.  During Phase I, students clear their own stoppages under instructor supervision when  the  order  of  fire  is  completed.    Students  bring  the  weapon  to  eye  level  (or approximate) to ensure the target remains in their field of vision.  WARNING:  If a light recoil or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1). 5.9.3.8.  To  correct  shooting  errors,  instructors  may  provide  additional  rounds  during Phases I and III. 5.9.3.9.  Repair or replace all targets after the practice order. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   103  5.9.3.10.  Instructors  evaluate  the  student's  ability  to  effectively  apply  marksmanship fundamentals  during  the  evaluation  phase  of  fire.    Instructors  do  not  teach  during  the evaluation  orders  of  fire.    They  may  assist  students  and  teach  shooting  fundamentals between the actual orders of fire.  They also correct safety infractions and supervise how students apply immediate action procedures when applicable. 5.9.3.11.  Students  clear  their  own  stoppages  during  each  order  of  fire.    Give  additional time to complete the order of fire if the student has, or is in the process of, successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage.  The ultimate goal is for the student  to  understand  why  the  stoppage  occurred  and  to  have  the  ability  to  correct  the problem and continue firing.  WARNING:  If a light recoil or difference in report is experienced,  the  instructor  must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile  not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1).  The tower operator will brief all students on these procedures prior to starting live-fire operation.  (T-1). 5.9.3.12.  Instructors  conduct  non-lethal  practice  and  qualification  after  shooters  have successfully  completed  Phases  I  and  II.    If  non-lethal  qualification  is  completed separately  from  lethal  qualification,  instructors  provide  all  required  safety  briefings  and conduct  performance  evaluations  on  all  mechanical  skills  prior  to  initiating  live-fire training and qualification. 5.9.3.13.  Conduct  Phase  III,  Non-Lethal  Practice.  Students  fire  5  rounds  at  a  10-meter “E” silhouette target during the practice order of fire.  In  Order 1, students fire 2 rounds  from  the  standing  position.    Instructors  analyze  and  mark  hits  on  targets.    For Order 2, students fire 2 rounds from the strong side barricade position.  After completion of firing, instructors analyze and mark hits.  During Order 3, students fire 1 round from the  over  barricade  position  and  students/instructors  reface  or  mark  hits  on  targets  after firing is complete. 5.9.3.14.  Conduct  Phase  IV,  Non-Lethal  Evaluation.  Students repeat the orders fired in Phase III for evaluation.  Instructors do not mark targets after each order and students fire each order after completion of the previous order as directed by the tower operator.  Shooters and instructors do not analyze targets until completion of all orders of fire. 5.9.3.15.  Upon  completion  of  all  evaluations,  Combat  Arms  documents  the  AF  Forms 522 for students in SFMIS.  Combat Arms makes separate entries for the lethal and non-lethal  phases  of  the  course.    Enter  Phases  I  and  II  as  AFQC  in  the  Course  block  and Qualified  or  Unqualified  as  applicable  in  the  status  block.    Enter  Phases  III  and  IV  as AFQC N/L in the Course block and Qualified or Unqualified as applicable in the status block.    Enter  the  type(s)  of  non-lethal  round(s)  the  individual  is  qualified  to  carry  (Fin Stabilized  and/or  Crowd  Dispersal)  in  the  Remarks  section.    Regardless  of  the  date  the individual qualified on AFQC (Phase I and II), the expiration date for the AFQC N/L is the  same  as  the  original  AFQC  expiration  date.    The  AFQC  N/L  qualification  will  not exceed the AFQC.  (T-1). 5.10.  Positions: 5.10.1.  Ready  Position.    The  student  is  standing  up  straight  and  relaxed.    Feet  should  be approximately  shoulder  width  apart,  the  stock  of  the  shotgun  is  in  the  shoulder  and  the   104  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 weapon is pointed down at a 45-degree angle.  The shotgun should be loaded, safety on and the student's eyes on the target. 5.10.2.  Standing  Position.    To  assume  the  standing  position  (right-handed),  face  the  target and spread feet a comfortable distance apart.  Step back with the right foot 6 to 8 inches and with  the  toes  of  the  right  foot  pointed  about  45  degrees  to  the  right.    The  left  foot  stays  in place with the toes pointed towards the target.  Place the butt of the weapon tightly into the right shoulder, keeping the right elbow parallel to the ground to form a good pocket for the butt  of  the  weapon.    Place  the  left  hand  on  the  fore-end  assembly  with  the  left  forearm parallel  to  the  weapon.    Lean  forward  bending  the  left  leg,  leaving  the  right  leg  and  back straight. 5.10.3.  Strong  Side  Barricade  Position.    Assume  a  standing  position  behind  the  barricade.  The back of the support arm or hand rests against the barricade for support.  The elbow of the shooting arm is in close to the body to lessen the individual's exposure to the enemy.  During classroom and dry-fire training, students should be taught the “cut the pie” method of target engagement. 5.10.4.  Over  Barricade  Position.    Assume  a  position  behind  the  barricade  and  lower  your position  to  the  height  of  the  over  barricade  support.    The  back  of  the  support  arm  or  hand rests on the barricade for support. Figure 5.1.

The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the  minimum training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship  skills  and performance evaluations required for qualification with a grenade launcher.  SF personnel should zero and qualify with the actual weapon with which they are armed. 6.2.  Training Overview. 6.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student's  first  participation  in  the  grenade  launcher-training program.  Initial training consists of classroom instruction, performance evaluations, passing all training objectives in Table 6.1 and qualifying on the grenade launcher AFQC. 6.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  grenade  launcher  AFQC  and passing  mechanical  evaluations.    The  required  frequencies  for  recurring  training  and qualification  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Weapons  safety  procedures  and  the  training objectives in Table 6.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training. 6.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 6.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and recurring training. 6.2.5.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units to  help  maintain  the  individual’s  proficiency.    Units  should  conduct  this  training  before exercises and deployments. 6.2.6.  Qualification Training Based on Weapon and Sighting System: 6.2.6.1.  Standard  quadrant  sight  and/or  leaf  sight:    Individuals  who  are  armed  with  the grenade launcher (GL) using either or both of these sights must qualify on Table I, Phase I  and  Phase  II  of  the  AFQC  in  Table  6.2    (T-1).    Students  zero  the  quadrant  sights  in Phase I, Order 1 and the leaf sights in Phase I, Order 2. 6.2.6.2.  Day/Night Sight (DNS) and Ballistic Sighting Module (BSM):  Individuals who are armed with the GL using the AN/PSQ 18A DNS or the BSM must qualify on Tables I, II and III of the AFQC in Table 6.2  (T-1).  If the individual is currently qualified on the GL AFQC using a different sighting system, they only complete academic training on the DNS or BSM and qualify on Tables I, II and III of the GL AFQC using the DNS or BSM.  If the individual is not currently qualified, they must complete the entire academic training  program,  and  qualify  on  the  appropriate  tables  of  the  GL  AFQC  included  in Table 6.2  (T-1).  The individual also needs to complete academic training on the DNS or BSM.  Note:  Combat Arms uses the AFSFC/FGWL approved DNS or BSM lesson plan to  conduct  this  training.    Students  qualifying  with  the  M320  grenade  launcher  must qualify on both the mounted and standalone phases/orders of fire in the GL AFQC.  (T-  106  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 1).  Students qualifying on the M203 grenade launcher are not required to complete the standalone phases and orders of fire. 6.2.6.3.  Individuals  complete  each  order  of  fire  in  the  GL  AFQC  using  the  sights specified  in  the  course  based  on  the  weapon  and  sights  with  which  they  will  be  armed.  The  DNS  includes  the  iron  sights  (DNS-IS)  and  the  infrared  aiming  laser  (DNS-IR-L).  The  BSM  includes  the  miniature  red  dot  sight  (BSM-MRDS)  and  the  infrared  aiming laser (BSM-IR-L). 6.2.6.4.  If  an  individual  has  the  need  to  be  armed  with  both  the  standard  quadrant/leaf sight and the DNS or BSM, they must complete academic training (including DNS/BSM training) and qualify on Tables I, II and III of the GL AFQC using the DNS or BSM, as well  as  completing  Table  I  using  the  quadrant  sight  and/or  leaf  sight  as  outlined  in paragraph 6.2.6.1.  (T-1).  Non-lethal qualification requirements are covered in paragraph 6.2.7. 6.2.6.5.  Combat Arms enters the tables completed in the remarks section of the shooter’s AF  Form  522  (SFMIS).    Note:    Do  not  enter  Table  III  in  this  manner;  follow  the guidance in paragraph 6.2.7. for documentation of this training. 6.2.7.  Non-Lethal Training:  Personnel identified by their unit commander to be armed with non-lethal  munitions  must  initially  qualify  on  Tables  I  and  II  of  the  AFQC  and  then  fire Table III.  (T-1).  Students who have been designated to fire the non-lethal phases should fire all  portions  in  one  day.    If  all  training  and  orders  of  fire  are  not  accomplished  in  one  day, students  require  a  refresher  class  on  the  mechanical  objectives.    Students  wear  issued  ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), and gas mask carrier, with gas mask and protective gloves, during all the non-lethal phases of fire.  Combat arms documents non-lethal qualification training as a separate qualification in SFMIS and on the individual’s AF Form 522.  This qualification expires on the original AFQC expiration date (Tables I and II) and individuals must be qualified on Tables I and II (Table II if needed) to maintain non-lethal qualification.  (T-1).  Instructors enter non-lethal qualification as AFQC N/L  in  the  course  block.    It  is  not  a  requirement  for  Combat  Arms  personnel  to  attend  the Interservice Non-lethal Individual Weapons Instructor Course (INIWIC); therefore, Combat Arms instructors are only required to be certified and qualify with the non-lethal ammunition in order to conduct training. 6.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 6.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 6.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   107  6.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 6.4.  Grenade  Launcher  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following paragraphs  is  intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for initial and recurring training.  Students must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of the training objectives listed in Table 6.1  (T-1).  Note:  Training times may vary depending on class size, student experience level, range location, etc.  Approximate training times for this program are: 6.4.1.  For AFQC – 5 to 6 hours. 6.4.2.  For remedial and unit training – as required. 6.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to use the grenade launcher against enemy targets. 6.6.  Training  Objectives  AFQC.  The training objectives needed for successful completion of this course are found in Table 6.1 6.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 6.6.1.1.

Course Information, Grenade Launcher AFQC. 6.9.1.  Targets for the course: 6.9.1.1.  The zero panel should be 2 meters by 2 meters (6 feet x 6 feet).  Place this target at  a  distance  of  200  meters.    If  the  range  is  already  constructed  with  150-meter  zero targets, these may be used instead of reconfiguring the range. 6.9.1.2.  Point target, 1 meter by 1.5 meters (vertical), one meter off the ground, at 90-115 meters from the firing line. 6.9.1.3.  Point target, 1.5 meters by 1.5 meters, .5 meter off the ground, at 135-150 meters from the firing line. 6.9.1.4.  Area  target,  vehicle,  or  55  gallon  drums,  "E"  targets,  etc.  grouped  together covering an area of 5-10 meters in circumference, 250-300 meters from the firing line. 6.9.1.5.  Targets are the same for Tables I and II, regardless of sights used. 6.9.1.6.  For Table III, Non-Lethal Qualification, use the Military “E” target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874) and Military “E” target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806) or suitable substitute.    Prior  to  training  draw  a  chalk  line  across  the  width  of  the  target;  13  inches down from the top of the head of the target and parallel to the bottom of the target (see Figure 6.1).  Hits on or above the line are counted as misses during training. 6.9.2.  Evaluation Standards: 6.9.2.1.  Table  I,  Phase  II,  Grenade  Launcher  Day  Fire  (GL  mounted  to  rifle/carbine)  - Qualified:  3 hits, one hit per target to qualify.  The maximum score for the evaluation is three  targets  engaged.    A  hit  is  any  round  directly  striking  a  point  target  or  a  round striking  within  5  meters  of  the  center  aiming  point  of  the  area  target.    This  phase  is required for all model grenade launchers and sights.  (T-1). 6.9.2.2.  Table I, Phase IV, Grenade Launcher Day Fire (GL not mounted [standalone] to rifle/carbine) - Qualified: 2 hits, one hit per target to qualify.  The maximum score for the evaluation is two targets engaged.  A hit is any round directly striking a point target.  This phase is required for standalone model grenade launchers, such as the M320, in addition to Table I, Phase II.  (T-1). 6.9.2.3.  Table II, Phase II, Grenade Launcher Night Fire (GL mounted to rifle/carbine) - Qualified:  2 hits, one hit per target to qualify.  The maximum score for the evaluation is two  targets  engaged.    A  hit  is  any  round  directly  striking  a  point  target.    This  phase  is required  for  all  model  grenade  launchers  using  the  DNS  or  BSM  sights,  in  addition  to AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   117  Table I requirements.  (T-1).    Note:  If conditions prevent the instructor from obtaining visual  confirmation  of  hits,  the  student  is  given  the  benefit  of  doubt,  based  on  the instructor’s determination of proper application of fundamentals. 6.9.2.4.  Table II, Phase IV Grenade Launcher Day Fire (GL not mounted [standalone] to rifle/carbine)  - Qualified:   2 hits,  one hit  per target to  qualify.  The maximum score for the evaluation is two targets engaged.  A hit is any round directly striking a point target.  This phase is required for standalone model grenade launchers, such as the M320, when using the DSN or BSM sights, in addition to Table I and Table II, Phase IV requirements.  (T-1).    Note:  If conditions prevent the instructor from obtaining visual confirmation of hits, the student is given the benefit of doubt, based on the instructor’s determination of proper application of fundamentals. 6.9.2.5.  Table III, Phase II (M1006 Sponge Grenade) - Qualified:  3 targets hit, out of 5, on the Military “E” target.  Rounds impacting above the neck line to include hits on the head are considered a miss.  Upon successful completion of Table III, Phases I and II, the student’s  AF  Form  522  are annotated  in  SFMIS  to  reflect Qualified  in  the  status  block, number  of  hits  in  the  score  block,  and  type  of  non-lethal  round  used  in  the  remarks section.    Students  are  only  qualified  with  the  type  of  non-lethal  round  that  was  fired during training and reflected on their AF Form 522. 6.9.2.6.  Table III, Phase II (M1029 Crowd Dispersal Cartridge) - Qualified:  3 targets hit out of 5 on the Military “E” target.  A hit is at least one pellet striking the target in the scoreable  area.    Rounds  impacting  above  the  neck  line  to  include  hits  on  the  head  are considered  a  miss.    Upon  successful  completion  of  Table  III,  Phases  I  and  II,  the student’s  AF  Form  522  are annotated  in  SFMIS  to  reflect Qualified  in  the  status  block, number  of  hits  in  the  score  block,  and  type  on  non-lethal  round  used  in  the  remarks section.    Students  are  only  qualified  with  the  type  of  non-lethal  round  that  was  fired during training and reflected on their AF Form 522. 6.9.3.  Course notes: 6.9.3.1.  Students do not touch or rest the grenade launcher on the support.  WARNING:  Ensure  the  rifle/carbine  sling  does  not  hang  in  front  of  launcher  barrel  and  the muzzle is not behind (blocked) by the sandbags or log wall. 6.9.3.2.  Students wear issued ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads  (if  issued),  and  gas  mask  carrier,  with  gas  mask  and  protective  gloves,  during  all live-fire training. 6.9.3.3.  When possible, students should fire using the peer/coach method.  They should work together on range determination; sight adjustments, lateral distance measurements, sensing and adjusted aiming point method of firing. 6.9.3.4.  Instructors teach students, as needed during zero and practice phases.  Instructors correct safety infractions and supervise immediate action procedures if stoppages occur.  Students keep the weapon at eye level (or approximate) during these procedures to ensure their target remains within view. 6.9.3.5.  Before firing from a new position, students are given an opportunity to practice assuming  the  position,  acquiring  sights  and  dry-firing  from  each  position.    Afford   118  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 sufficient  time  for  instructors  to  observe,  coach  and  evaluate  each  student.    Instructors evaluate the student's ability to effectively apply marksmanship fundamentals during the evaluation phases of the course. 6.9.3.6.  Instructors may provide additional rounds to correct shooting errors during zero and practice phases of the course. 6.9.3.7.  Students clear their own stoppages under instructor supervision during live-fire.  Instructors  should  stop  the  time  and  supervise  student  actions.    The  instructor  then resumes  the  time  limit  once  the  student  has  properly  performed  immediate  action.  WARNING:    If  a  light  recoil  or  difference  in  report  is  experienced,  the  instructor must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile  not  stuck  in  barrel)  after  the student clears the stoppage.  (T-1). 6.9.3.8.  The  instructor  gives  the  student  additional  time  to  complete  the  order  of  fire  if the  student  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of,  successfully  applying  immediate  or  remedial action to clear the stoppage.  The ultimate goal is for the student to understand why the stoppage occurred and to have the ability to correct the problem and continue firing. 6.9.3.9.  Instructors do not teach during the evaluation orders of fire.  However, they may assist students and teach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders of fire.  They also  correct  safety  infractions  and  supervise  how  students  apply  immediate  action procedures when applicable. 6.9.3.10.  Throughout  the  course  of  fire,  students  are  required  to  determine  target distance,  adjust  sights,  acquire  the  target,  engage  the  target,  reload,  reacquire  the  target and re-engage within the allocated time limit.  The allotted time will start after the student is in the ready position and once the command of “fire” is given.  Students use approved grenade launcher vests or MOLLE pouches to conduct reloads.  During practice phases, if the student does not fire all the required rounds within the time limit, they are allowed to fire them after the time limit, on the instructor’s command.  During evaluation phases, if  the  student  fails  to  fire  all  the  required  rounds  within  the  time  limit,  the  remaining rounds are counted as misses. 6.9.3.11.  Instructors  conduct  non-lethal  practice  and  qualification  after  students  have successfully  completed  all  required  phases  of  Table  I  and  Table  II.    If  non-lethal qualification  is  completed  separately  from  lethal  qualification,  instructors  provide  all safety  briefings  and  conduct  performance  evaluations  on  all  mechanical  skills  prior  to initiating live-fire training and qualification. 6.9.3.12.  Conduct Phase I of Table III, Non-Lethal Practice.  Before firing Practice Phase I, draw a line using a chalk or white grease pencil 13 inches from the top of the head of the Military “E” target facer that runs parallel with the bottom of the target.  The shooter uses the line as a means to identify an unauthorized aiming point.  Students fire a total of 5  rounds  at  a  Military  “E”  silhouette  target.    In  Order  1, students  fire 1  round  from  the standing  position  at  a  15-meter  “E”  silhouette  target.    In  Order  2,  students  fire  1  round from  the  kneeling  unsupported  position  at  a  15-meter  “E”  silhouette  target.    After completion  of  firing,  instructors/students  analyze  targets,  mark  hits  and  move  targets  to 25 meters.  In Order 3, students fire 1 round from the standing position at a 25-meter “E” silhouette target.  In Order 4, students fire 2 rounds from the kneeling supported position AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   119  at  a  25-meter  “E”  silhouette  target.    After  completion  of  firing,  instructors/students analyze targets, mark hits and reface targets. 6.9.3.13.  Conduct  Phase  II  of  Table  III,  Non-Lethal  Evaluation.    Before  firing  the evaluation Phase II, draw a line using chalk or white grease pencil 13 inches from the top of the head of the Military “E” target facer that runs parallel with the bottom of the target.  The student uses the line as a means to identify an unauthorized aiming point.  Students repeat  the  orders  fired  in  Phase  I  of  Table  III  for  evaluation.    Instructors  do  not  mark targets after each order and students fire each order after completion of the previous order as  directed  by  the  tower  operator.    Students  and  instructors  do  not  analyze  targets  until completion  of  all  orders  of  fire.    Note:    For  the  M1029  Crowd  Dispersal  Cartridge, instructors determine if the target was successfully engaged after each shot is fired.  This may  be  accomplished  by  marking  hits  or  observing  each  shot  fired  to  determine  if  the projectiles hit the target in the scoreable area. 6.9.3.14.  Positions: 6.9.3.14.1.  Ready  Position.    Before  each  order  of  fire  and  on  the  instructor’s command,  the  student  assumes  the  firing  position.    The  grenade  launcher  is  loaded, with the safety on and the student's eyes are on the target. 6.9.3.14.2.  Prone  Supported  Position.    To  assume  the  prone  supported  position,  the student  first  assumes  the  rifle/carbine  prone  position,  adjusts  the  position  to  the available  support  and  places  the  left  hand  or  forearm  against  the  support.    Whether the  left  elbow  is  directly  under  the  weapon  is  of  less  importance  in  this  position because the support, rather than the arm, sustains the weight of the weapon.  No part of the grenade launcher or rifle/carbine should be touching the support as this reduces the  student's  control  of  the  weapon.    The  placement  of  the  rifle/carbine  stock  in  the student's  shoulder  depends  greatly  on  the  distance  of  the  target  being  engaged.  Generally,  targets  engaged  at  distances  greater  than  150  meters  require  the rifle/carbine stock being placed low against the student's shoulder or on the ground. 6.9.3.14.3.  Kneeling  Supported  Position.    The  kneeling  supported  position  is particularly effective from level ground or ground sloping upward toward the target.  A  right  handed  student  assumes  the  kneeling  barricade  position  by  kneeling  on  the right  knee,  right  buttock  resting  on  right  heel,  left  foot  forward,  and  pointed  toward the target.  The student leans  forward over the left leg, resting  the upper part of  the left arm on the left knee, adjusts the position to the available support and places the left hand or forearm against the support.  Whether the student's left elbow is directly under  the  weapon  is  of  less  importance  in  this  position  because  the  support,  rather than the arm, sustains the weight of the weapon.  No part of the grenade launcher or rifle/carbine should be touching the support as this reduces the student's control of the weapon.    The  placement  of  the  rifle/carbine  stock  in  the  student's  shoulder  depends greatly  on  the  distance  of  the  target  being  engaged.    Generally,  targets  engaged  at distances  greater  than  150  meters  require  the  rifle/carbine  stock  being  placed  low against  the  student's  shoulder.    This  permits  the  student  to  obtain  correct  sight alignment and sight picture. 6.9.3.14.4.  Standing:    To  assume  the  standing  position,  the  student  first  places  feet shoulder  width  apart  with  toes  pointed  towards  the  target  and  weapon  side  foot   120  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 approximately  8”  back.    Knees  should  be  bent  slightly  with  the  weight  distributed evenly on the feet.  Shoulders should initially be squared in the beginning, however; this position is not favorable for rapid multiple threat engagement.  Instructors should allow students to angle the shoulders for best control of the weapon and to acquire the sights  on  the  DNS  or  BSM.    Bend  at  the  waist  with  the  upper  body  aggressively forward,  “shoulders  over  knees,  knees  over  toes”  to  absorb  recoil,  allow  faster recovery  and  follow-up  shots.    The  placement  of  the  rifle/carbine/grenade  launcher stock  in  the  student's  shoulder  depends  greatly  on  the  distance  of  the  target  being engaged.  Generally, targets engaged at distances greater than 150 meters require the rifle/carbine/grenade launcher stock placed low against the student's shoulder. Figure 6.1.

The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the minimum  training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship skills and performance evaluations required for qualification with the M72 LAW or M136 AT4. 7.2.  Training Overview. 7.2.1.  Initial Training.  This is the student's first participation in the training program.  Initial training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  performance  evaluations,  passing  all  training objectives in Table 7.1 and qualifying on the Light Anti-armor Weapons AFQC. 7.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  Light  Anti-armor  Weapons AFQC and passing mechanical evaluations.  The required frequencies for recurring training and qualification are outlined in AFI 36-2654.  Weapons safety procedures and the training objectives in Table 7.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training. 7.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 7.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and recurring training. 7.2.5.  Unit  Training.    Refresher  training  on  operator  skills  and  knowledge  provided  by weapons  qualified  members  of  the  unit  to  help  maintain  individual's  proficiency.    Units should conduct this training before exercises and deployments. 7.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 7.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 7.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. 7.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the   122  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 7.4.  Light Anti-armor Weapons Qualification Plan of Instruction.  The plan in the following paragraphs  is  intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for initial and recurring training.  Students must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of the training objectives listed in Table 7.1  (T-1).  Note:  Training times may vary depending on class size, student experience level, range location, etc.  Approximate training times for this program are: 7.4.1.  For AFQC training – 5 to 7 hours. 7.4.2.  For remedial and unit training – as needed. 7.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to successfully use the weapon against enemy targets. 7.6.  Training  Objectives  AFQC.  The training objectives needed for successful completion of this course are found in Table 7.1 7.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 7.6.1.1.  Safety rules.  (T-1). 7.6.1.2.  Characteristics, nomenclature, packaging and general data.  (T-1). 7.6.1.3.  Functioning.  (T-1). 7.6.1.4.  Range firing procedures.

Submachine  Gun  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the  minimum training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship  skills  and performance evaluations required for qualification with a submachine gun (not carbines). 8.2.  Training Overview. 8.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student's  first  participation  in  the  Submachine  Gun Training  Program.   Initial  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  performance evaluations,  passing  all  training  objectives  in  Table  8.1  and  qualifying  on  the  Submachine Gun AFQC. 8.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training consists  of classroom instruction, qualification  on the Submachine Gun AFQC and passing  mechanical  evaluations.    The  required  frequencies  for  recurring  training  and qualification  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Weapons  safety  procedures  and  the  training objectives in Table 8.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training. 8.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 8.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and recurring training. 8.2.5.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units to  help  maintain  the  individual's  proficiency.    Units  should  conduct  this  training  before exercises and deployments. 8.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 8.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 8.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. 8.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   129  range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 8.4.  Submachine  Gun  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following paragraphs  is  intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for initial and recurring training.  Students must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of the training objectives listed in Table 8.1  (T-1).  Note:  Training times may vary depending on class size, student experience level, range location, etc.  Approximate training times for this program are: 8.4.1.  Qualification training – 4 to 5 hours. 8.4.2.  Remedial training – as needed. 8.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to successfully use the submachine gun against enemy targets. 8.6.

Course Notes:  Briefcase, courier bag and shoulder harness are used by OSI only. 8.9.3.1.  Before firing the practice phase, draw a 10-inch (vital area) circle on the target using chalk.  The circle is visible to the shooter at all target distances.  The shooter uses the circle as a reference point during the practice fire to aid in placing rounds in the vital area of the target.  Locate the 10-inch circle centered on the “E” target with the top edge of the circle 13 ¼ inches from the top of the head of the target (even with side cut notches on "E" backers and facers).  A template can be made of plywood, acrylic plastic, or other material. 8.9.3.2.  Start  all  orders  of  fire  with  the  submachine  gun  with  an  empty  chamber,  bolt forward, selector in the semiautomatic position and the trigger pulled. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   135  8.9.3.3.  Instructors  teach  and  coach  students  as  needed  during  the  practice  phase.  Instructors  correct  safety  infractions  and  supervise  immediate  action  procedures  if stoppages occur. 8.9.3.4.  Before  live  firing  from  a  new  position,  provide  students  an  opportunity  to practice assuming the position and dry-fire from each position.  For each order of training requiring the weapon to be removed from concealment, provide each student at least five practice runs with an unloaded weapon.  Afford sufficient time for instructors to observe, coach and evaluate each student.  Evaluation of the student's ability to effectively apply marksmanship fundamentals is accomplished during the evaluation phases. 8.9.3.5.  During  the  practice  phase,  students  clear  their  own  stoppages  under  instructor supervision  when  the  order  of  fire  is  completed.    WARNING:    If  a  light  recoil  or difference in report is experienced, the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1). 8.9.3.6.  On  Practice  Order  1,  instructors  and  students  check  targets  after  each  5-round string.  Shooters may make  additional sight adjustments at  any time during the practice orders, as required. 8.9.3.7.  Practice  Order  1,  2,  4  and  5  and  Evaluation  Order  1,  3  and  4  are  fired  in  the semiautomatic (R) mode. 8.9.3.8.  On  Practice  Order  2  through  5  and  all  evaluation  orders,  OSI  personnel  use  a courier  bag,  shoulder  harness  or  briefcase  if  available.    If  the  shooters  are  not  using concealed  carry  equipment,  deduct  5  seconds  from  Practice  Order  2  through  5  and  all evaluation orders. 8.9.3.9.  On  Practice  Order  3  and  Evaluation  Order  2,  the  shooter  fires  a  15-round magazine full automatic (A).  Shooters should fire in bursts of 2 to 3 rounds. 8.9.3.10.  The  over  barricade  position  is  a  supported  position.    Students  may  use  the barricade for support.  Reload from behind cover.  Do not allow the weapon to touch the support. 8.9.3.11.  To correct shooting errors, instructors may provide additional rounds during the practice phase. 8.9.3.12.  Repair or replace targets after the practice phase. 8.9.3.13.  Before  firing  the  evaluation  phase,  draw  a  10-inch  (vital  area)  circle  on  the target using a pencil or pen so the circle is not visible to the shooter during the evaluation.  The  circle  is  used  for  scoring  purposes  at  this  point  in  the  course.    Give  students  the opportunity  to  view  their  targets  upon  completion  of  the  phase  so  they  can  see  if  their shots are in and around the vital area of the target. 8.9.3.14.  Instructors do not teach or coach during the evaluation phase.  However, they may assist students and teach or coach shooting fundamentals between the actual orders of  fire.    They  also  correct  safety  infractions  and  supervise  the  application  of  immediate action procedures by students when applicable. 8.9.3.15.  Reload magazines between orders of fire, as necessary.   136  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 8.9.3.16.  Students  clear  their  own  stoppages  during  each  order  of  fire  in  the  evaluation phase.  Give additional time to complete the order of fire if the student has, or is in the process  of,  successfully  applying  immediate  or  remedial  action  to  clear  the  stoppage.  The ultimate goal is for the student to understand why the stoppage occurred and have the ability  to  correct  the  problem  and  continue  firing.    WARNING:    The  tower  operator will  brief  students  that  if  they  experience  a  light  recoil  or  difference  in  report  the instructor must verify the weapon is safe to fire (projectile not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared. 8.9.3.17.  Eye and hearing protection is used by all personnel on the range. 8.9.3.18.  Inspect  all  magazines  at  the  completion  of  training  to  make  sure  they  do  not contain live rounds. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   137  Chapter 9 M249 AUTOMATIC RIFLE TRAINING PROGRAM 9.1.  M249  Automatic  Rifle  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the minimum  training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship skills and performance evaluations required for qualification with the M249.  SF personnel zero and qualify with the actual weapon with which they are armed.  Note:  Any personnel, regardless of  arming  group,  who  are  authorized  and  equipped  with  night  aiming  or  night  scope  devices (AN/PEQ-15,  AN/PAS-13  V2  Medium  Weapon  Thermal  Sight,    etc.)  should  successfully complete  academic  instruction  and  the  applicable  phases  of  Phase  III,  Night  Vision  Optics  and Laser  Aiming  Devices  Training,  and  Phase  IV,  Night  Scope  Training.    The  gunner  zeroes  the aiming devices/sights they take on deployment or with which they are armed with in-garrison. 9.2.  Training Overview. 9.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student’s  first  participation  in  the  M249  Qualification Training  Program.   Initial  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  performance evaluations,  passing  all  applicable  training  objectives  in  Table  9.1  and  qualifying  on  the M249  Automatic  Rifle  AFQC.    Full  distance  (AFQC/FD)  training  is  desired.    When  full distance  range  facilities  are  not  available,  AFSFC/FGWL  may  grant  individual  bases permission to qualify personnel using Table 9.3. as an initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M).  Individuals  who  have  not  qualified  on  the  automatic  rifle  within  12  months  must  requalify using initial training standards.  (T-1).  The AF Form 522 is annotated to reflect a 12-month qualification. 9.2.2.  Live-fire  Recurring  Training  -  12  Month.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial qualification.    It  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  required  evaluation phases of the AFQC (Full Distance or  10-Meter) and passing  mechanical evaluations.  The required  frequencies  for  recurring  training  and  qualification  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.  Full distance training is desired.  Individuals will qualify on either full distance course, Table 9.2 or the 10-meter course, Table 9.3 to meet training requirements.  (T-1).  This evaluation is mandatory on an annual basis. 9.2.3.  Remedial Training.  This is in-depth training needed to correct marksmanship or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to  personnel  who  failed  an  evaluation.    Same  day  refires  or  on-the-spot  corrections  are  not remedial training. 9.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and 12-month recurring training. 9.2.5.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units to  help  maintain  the  operator’s  proficiency.    Units  should  conduct  this  training  before exercises and deployments. 9.2.6.  If AFSFC/FGWL has waived the requirement for the night fire portions of the course as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654,  Combat  Arms  still  completes  academic  training,  performance evaluations and conducts dry-fire on these skills/objectives using all night vision and aiming equipment shooters have issued to them.   138  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 9.2.7.  The  MAJCOM/A4S  in  coordination  with  AFSFC/FGWL  may  direct  the  option  for vehicle firing if there is a mission requirement.  If the weapon is employed from a vehicle, gunners complete Phase V, Vehicle Firing, of the machine gun AFQC they are firing. 9.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 9.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 9.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and student to instructor ratios. 9.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 9.4.  M249 Qualification Plan of Instruction.  The plan in the following paragraphs intends to provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for  the  initial  and  recurring training.    Students  must  meet  and  be  evaluated  to  the  performance  standards  of  the  applicable training  objectives  listed  in  Table  9.1.    (T-1).    Exception:    If  student(s)  will  not  employ  the M249 from the vehicle or if AFSFC/FGWL has waived the vehicle firing requirement, students do  not  have  to  be  evaluated  on  the  training  objectives  for  vehicle  firing  listed  in  Table  9.1  or complete the vehicle firing portions of the qualification course.  Note:  Training times may vary depending  on  class  size,  student  experience  level,  range  location,  etc.    Approximate  training times for this program are: 9.4.1.  Initial training – 12 to 14 hours. 9.4.2.  Recurring training (12-month) – 8 to 10 hours. 9.4.3.  Remedial and unit training – as needed. 9.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to use the M249 against enemy targets.  With the exception of operator maintenance, the students’ performance is evaluated on all tasks without assistance. 9.6.  Training  Objectives  AFQC.  The training objectives needed for successful completion of this course are found in Table 7.1 9.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 9.6.1.1.

Course Information, M249 AFQC (Full Distance). 9.9.1.  Course Targets: TIME (MIN)  DISTANCE M/YDS  TARGET QTY  9.9.1.1.  Double  "E"  silhouette  targets  (NSN  6920-00-795-1806)  or  empty  55-gallon drums may be used to represent personnel for 300 to 800-meter firing.  Mounds of earth or salvaged vehicles may also be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets. 9.9.1.2.  When using silhouettes or 55-gallon drums as area targets, position at least three targets within a 5-meter diameter.  Leave at least 50-meters between each area target. 9.9.1.3.  Gunners  who  will  employ  the  weapon  using  an  optical  aiming  device,  such  as the  M150  Rifle  Combat  Optic  or  M145  Machine  Gun  Optic,  will  complete  all  day-fire orders using the optic.  (T-1). 9.9.2.  Course Standards. 9.9.2.1.  Phase II, Order 1 - Student successfully engages all six targets. 9.9.2.2.  Phase II, Order 2 - Student successfully engages all 13 targets. 9.9.2.3.  On evaluation phases, if the beaten zone covers the target, score it as a hit. 9.9.3.  Course Notes: 9.9.3.1.  There are no time limits during Phase I, III and IV.  Instructors analyze targets, render help to students as needed, correct safety infractions and supervise the application of immediate action. 9.9.3.2.  Phase III and IV are mandatory for personnel conducting qualification in support of Unit Type Code (UTC) positions using STANO equipment and optional to fill mission training  needs  for  individual  units.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  requires  an  approved  waiver from AFSFC/FGWL for any portion of these phases that they cannot complete because of range limitations or other limiting factors. 9.9.3.2.1.  Phase III – The purpose of this phase is to teach students to rapidly engage threats  utilizing  night  vision/laser  aiming  devices  (e.g.,  AN/PVS-14  with  AN/PEQ-15).    Combat  Arms  only  allows  the  use  of  laser  aiming  devices  that  have  been certified  safe  to  use  by  the  USAF  Laser  System  Safety  Review  Board  and  that  are identified  as  approved  for  the  user  on  the  AFSFC/FGWL  USAF  Authorized  Small Arms/Light  weapons  (SA/LW)  Accessories  Listing.    Shooters  should  successfully engage all six targets and demonstrate proper fundamentals using a currently AFSFC approved laser aiming device and Air Force approved night vision devices. 9.9.3.2.2.  Phase  IV  -  This  phase  of  fire  teaches  students  to  engage  threats  using  a current  AFSFC  approved  night  scope  (e.g.,  AN/PAS-13  V2).    Shooters  should successfully  engage  all  six  targets  and  demonstrate  proper  fundamentals  using  a current AFSFC approved night scope. 9.9.3.3.  Phase  V is  mandatory  for personnel completing qualification to support  UTC’s requiring  vehicle  mounted  weapons  and  optional  for  in-garrison  requirements  to  fill   146  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 mission  training  needs  for  individual  units.    (T-1).    For  qualification  to  support  UTC requirements,  Combat  Arms  requires  an  approved  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL  for  any portion  of  this  phase  that  they  cannot  complete  because  of  range  limitations  or  other limiting  factors.    A  waiver  is  not  required  for  in-garrison  requirements.    In  Phase  V, gunners should use one area target at 300 meters with at least four double "E" silhouettes or  55-gallon  drums.    Position  the  vehicle  parallel  to  the  firing  line  with  the  weapon pointed down range (perpendicular to the vehicle). 9.9.3.4.  Assistant gunners are not used.  Peer coach method is permissible. 9.9.3.5.  Students wear issued ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads  (if  issued),  and  gas  mask  carrier,  with  gas  mask  and  protective  gloves,  during  the entire course. 9.9.3.6.  Students  stow  the  gas  mask  in  the  carrier  when  not  required  for  wear  and maintain the CWDE gloves on their person during the entire course. 9.9.3.7.  Students may make sight corrections at any time during the course. 9.9.3.8.  Students complete all firing except Phase V in the bipod mode. 9.9.3.9.  On Practice Order 3, the student engages a minimum of 5 targets in a deep target formation with the 25-round belt, dons the gas mask, and engages a minimum of 8 targets in a linear with depth formation with the 75-round belt. 9.9.3.10.  After  engaging  all  point  targets  on  Evaluation  Order  1,  the  operator immediately  puts  the  gun  on  Safe,  dons  the  gas  mask  and  gloves  and  engages  all  area targets. 9.9.3.11.  When engaging deep targets and linear with depth targets, the operator engages targets  as  a  single  gun  covering  the  entire  target.    For  example,  initial  lay  on  the  linear target with depth is midpoint.  The operator then traverses and searches to the near flank (left),  back  to  the  far  flank  (right)  and  then  back  to  midpoint.    Initial  lay  on  the  deep target  is  also  midpoint.    The  operator  then  searches  down  to  the  near end,  up  to  the  far end and then back to the midpoint. 9.9.3.12.  Eye and hearing protection is used by all personnel on the range. 9.9.3.13.  During Phase I, III, and IV, students clear their own stoppages under instructor supervision.    Resume  firing  once  immediate  action  has  been  properly  performed.  WARNING:    If  a  light  recoil  or  difference  in  report  is  experienced,  the  instructor must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile  not  stuck  in  barrel)  after  the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1). 9.9.3.14.  Students conduct a barrel change before starting Phase II. 9.9.3.15.  Students  clear  their  own  stoppages  under  instructor  supervision  during  each order of fire in Phase II.  Instructors stop the time and supervise student actions.  Resume the time limit once immediate action has been properly performed.  Give additional time to  complete  the  order  of  fire  if  the  student  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of,  successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage.  The ultimate goal is for the student  to  understand  why  the  stoppage  occurred  and  to  have  the  ability  to  correct  the problem and continue firing.  WARNING:  If a light recoil or difference in report is AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   147  experienced,  the  instructor  must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile  not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1). 9.9.3.16.  Ammunition belts should be divided up to match the required rounds for each order  of  fire.    After  firing  the  required  number  of  bursts,  students  may  go  back  (time permitting) and reengage targets still posing a threat (no hits).  Rounds may not be fired after the cease fire command is given during phase II. 9.9.3.17.  The AF Form 522 only reflects a qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" status for the  entire  course;  hits  are  not  entered  into  SFMIS.    If  students  fail  to  qualify  on Evaluation Order 1 or  Evaluation  Order 2, students  are unqualified.   They need  only  to refire and meet qualification criteria for the order they failed to achieve qualified status. 9.9.3.18.  Instructors enter the models of small arms STANO equipment (e.g., AN/PEQ-15, AN/PAS-13 V2) the individual qualified with in the remarks section of the AF Form 522. 9.9.3.19.  Enter  the  phase(s)  of  the  course  not  completed  by  the  individual  and  cite  the waiver/deviation authorization source in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Note: Some  deviations  (e.g.,  gas  mask  or  night  fire  phases)  may  not  meet  the  CCMD requirements.    Installations/units  deploying  personnel  with  a  waiver/deviation  to  any portions  of  the  course,  including  night  fire  phases,  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  approved waiver to the CCMD OPR and ensure the AF 522 is properly documented as directed by AFI 36-2654.

Gunners who will employ the weapon using an optical aiming device, such as the M150 Rifle Combat Optic or M145 Machine Gun Optic, will complete all day-fire orders using the optic.  (T-1). 9.10.2.  Course Standards. 9.10.2.1.  Phase  II,  Order  1  -  Qualified;  All  13  targets  have  a  minimum  of  2  hits  per target. 9.10.2.2.  Phase  II,  Order  2  -  Qualified;  All  10  targets  have  a  minimum  of  2  hits  per target. 9.10.3.  Course Notes: 9.10.3.1.  There are no time limits during the practice phase.  Instructors analyze targets, render help to students as needed, correct safety infractions and supervise the application of immediate action.  The entire course of fire is based on the student’s ability to fire a 3 to  5-round  burst  during  training  and  is  used  to  teach  firing  discipline  and  the  tactical   150  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 employment  of  the  automatic  rifle.    In  an  actual  real-world  scenario,  the  shooter  would continue to fire (sustained, rapid or cyclic) until the threat is eliminated. 9.10.3.2.  Assistant gunners are not used.  Peer/coach method is permissible. 9.10.3.3.  Students  wear  issued  ICE,  including  helmet,  body  armor,  LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), and gas mask carrier, with gas mask and protective gloves, during the entire course. 9.10.3.4.  The operator stows the gas mask in the carrier when not required for wear and has the CWDE/protective gloves on their person during the entire course. 9.10.3.5.  Students may make sight corrections at any time during the course. 9.10.3.6.  Students complete all firing in the bipod mode. 9.10.3.7.  Ammunition belts should be divided up to match the required rounds for each order  of  fire.    Ensure  the  AF  Forms  522  and  710  reflect  the  correct  number  of  rounds fired by the student. 9.10.3.8.  During Phase I, Order 3, the student is to practice controlled burst firing while applying  the  basic  fundamentals  of  M249  marksmanship.    This  exercise  gives  the instructor an opportunity to detect common errors by analyzing each of the four pasters. 9.10.3.9.  Initial lay on all targets is midpoint.  After the initial burst, the gunner moves to the  closest  part  of  the  target  to  the  gunner,  then  moves  to  the  farthest  point  from  the gunner  and  finally  back  to  the  midpoint.    Instructors  ensure  targets  are  large  enough  to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.  Gunners should ensure beaten zones overlap while firing.  This tactic/technique is used for training and  simulates  no  known  threat.    In  real-life  situations,  gunners  tactically  engage  the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position. 9.10.3.10.  Phase I, Order 5.  After engaging both point targets (B5 and B6), the operator immediately puts the gun on Safe, dons the gas mask and gloves and engages the linear target with depth (B7 thru B8). 9.10.3.11.  The gunner conducts a barrel change before starting Phase II. 9.10.3.12.  After  completing  Phase  I,  Order  4  and  Phase  II,  Order  1,  the  firing  point instructor gives the command “Gas, Gas, Gas” and the gunner immediately puts the gun on Safe and dons the gas mask and gloves.  The gunner then engages targets D5 and D6. 9.10.3.13.  During  Phase  I,  students  clear  their  own  stoppages  under  instructor supervision.    Resume  firing  once  immediate  action  has  been  properly  performed.  WARNING:    If  a  light  recoil  or  difference  in  report  is  experienced,  the  instructor must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile  not  stuck  in  barrel)  after  the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1). 9.10.3.14.  Students  clear  their  own  stoppages  under  instructor  supervision  during  each order of fire in Phase II.  Instructors stop the time and supervise student actions.  Resume the time limit once immediate action has been properly performed.  Give additional time to  complete  the  order  of  fire  if  the  student  has,  or  is  in  the  process  of,  successfully applying immediate or remedial action to clear the stoppage.  The ultimate goal is for the student  to  understand  why  the  stoppage  occurred  and  to  have  the  ability  to  correct  the AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   151  problem and continue firing.  WARNING:  If a light recoil or  difference in report is experienced,  the  instructor  must  verify  the  weapon  is  safe  to  fire  (projectile  not stuck in barrel) after the stoppage is cleared.  (T-1). 9.10.3.15.  Phase III and IV are optional to fill mission training needs for units or UTCs using  STANO  equipment.    Implementation  of  these  phases  is  at  the  discretion  of  the AFSFC. 9.10.3.15.1.  Phase  III  -  The  purpose  of  this  phase  is  to  teach  students  to  rapidly engage  threats  utilizing  night  vision/laser  aiming  devices  (e.g.,  AN/PVS-14  with AN/PEQ-15).  Combat Arms will only allow the use of laser aiming devices that have been certified safe to use by the USAF Laser System Safety Review Board and that are identified as approved for the user on the AFSFC/FGWL USAF Authorized Small Arms/Light  weapons  (SA/LW)  Accessories  Listing.    Shooters  should  successfully engage  all  six  targets  and  demonstrate  proper  fundamentals  using  a  current  AFSFC approved night vision devices and laser aiming device. 9.10.3.15.2.  Phase IV - This phase of fire will teach students to engage threats using a  current  AFSFC  approved  night  scope  (e.g.,  AN/PAS-13  V2).    Shooters  should successfully  engage  all  six  targets  and  demonstrate  proper  fundamentals  using  a current AFSFC approved night scope. 9.10.3.16.  Phase  V  is  optional  to  fill  mission  training  needs  for  units  using  or  UTCs using  vehicle  mounted  weapons.    Implementation  of  this  phase  is  at  the  discretion  of AFSFC/FGWL.    Combat  Arms  may  use  two  different  methods  to  accomplish  this training. 9.10.3.16.1.  Use  blank  ammunition  and  the  Multiple  Integrated  Laser  Engagement System (MILES) equipped weapons and targets.  Use one area target at 300 meters, with at least four double "E" silhouettes or 55-gallon drums.  Hang MILES harnesses over  the  targets  or  drums.    Position  the  vehicle  parallel  to  the  firing  line  with  the weapon pointing down range (perpendicular to the vehicle).  An instructor should be available with a MILES reset key and radio.  The instructor indicates target hits and resets MILES harnesses for each gunner. 9.10.3.16.2.  Another  method  is  to  use  the  Close  Combat  Mission  Capability  Kit (CCMCK) along with CCMCK marking rounds.  Use one area target at 100 meters, with  at  least  four  double  "E"  silhouettes  or  55-gallon  drums.    Position  the  vehicle parallel to the firing line with the weapon pointing down range (perpendicular to the vehicle).  An instructor should be available with field  glasses  or  a spotting scope to verify  hits  on  the  targets.    Combat  Arms  will  follow  the  safety  guidance  in  the  HQ USAF/A4SX  Close  Combat  Mission  Capability  Kit  (CCMCK)  Training  Concept  of Operations (CONOPS), along with the guidance in AFI 36-2654. 9.10.3.17.  Eye and hearing protection is used by all personnel on the range. 9.10.3.18.  The AF Form 522 only reflects a qualified "Q" or unqualified "UQ" status for the  entire  course;  hits  are  not  entered  into  SFMIS.    If  the  students  fail  to  qualify  on Evaluation  Order  1  or  2,  students  are  unqualified.    They  need  only  to  refire  and  meet qualification criteria for the order failed to achieve qualified status.   152  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 9.10.3.19.  Instructors enter the models of small arms STANO equipment (e.g., AN/PEQ-15,  AN/PAS-13  V2)  the  individual  trained  with  in  the  remarks  section  of  the  AF  Form 522. 9.10.3.20.  Instructors enter the table(s) and phase(s) of the course not completed by the individual and cite the waiver/deviation authorization source in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Note: Home-station deviations (e.g., gas mask or night fire phases) may not  meet  the  CCMD  requirements  and  unit  deployment  managers  must  ensure  Combat Arms is aware of the requirements at the deployed location.  (T-2). AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   153  Chapter 10 M107 RIFLE TRAINING PROGRAM 10.1.  M107 Rifle AFQC.  The AFQC provides Air Force members with the minimum training; weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship  skills  and performance evaluations required for qualification with M107 rifles. 10.2.  Training Overview. 10.2.1.  Initial Training.  This is the student's first participation in the M107 rifle qualification training program.  Initial training consists of classroom instruction, performance evaluations, passing all training objectives in Table 10.1 and qualifying on the M107 Rifle AFQC. 10.2.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training consists of classroom instruction, qualification on the appropriate course of fire, and passing  mechanical  evaluations.    The  required  frequencies  for  recurring  training  and qualification  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Weapons  safety  procedures  and  the  training objectives in Table 10.1 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training. 10.2.2.1.  Initial  training  on  the  AFQC  is  a  prerequisite  before  proceeding  to  more advanced specialized training courses. 10.2.2.2.  Qualification length for this program is 12 months for all arming groups. 10.2.3.  Remedial  Training.    This  is  in-depth  training  needed  to  correct  marksmanship  or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to personnel who failed an evaluation.  Same day refires or on-the-spot corrections are not remedial training. 10.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Evaluation is completed for initial and recurring training. 10.2.5.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units to help maintain the individual's proficiency.  Units should conduct this training on a regular basis. 10.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 10.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 10.3.2.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during  grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor,  tower operator and all firing point instructors.  Instructor to student ratio is 1 to 1. 10.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator   154  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 10.4.  M107  Rifle  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The plan in the following paragraphs is intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for  initial  and recurring  training.    Students  must  meet  and  be  evaluated  to  the  performance  standards  of  the training  objectives  listed  in  Table  10.1    (T-1).    Note:    Training  times  may  vary  depending  on class  size,  student  experience  level,  range  location,  etc.    Approximate  training  times  for  this program are: 10.4.1.  Initial and Recurring – 40 to 48 hours 10.4.2.  Remedial and unit training – as needed. 10.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the ability to use the rifle effectively against enemy targets. 10.6.  Training Objectives AFQC.  The training objectives needed for successful completion of this course are found in Table 10.1 10.6.1.  Intermediate  Training  Objectives.    The  students  must  understand,  demonstrate  and apply: 10.6.1.1.  Safety procedures.  (T-1). 10.6.1.2.  Characteristics, nomenclature and general data.  (T-1). 10.6.1.3.

Course Information, M107 Rifle AFQC. 10.9.1.  Course Target: 10.9.1.1.  Rifle  Target  “B”  600  Yds  (bullseye  target)  (NSN  6920-00-900-8205).    The target has 4 black scoring rings (the 10X ring (6”), 10 ring (12”), 9 ring (18”) and the 8 ring (24”)), as well as 3 white scoring rings (the 7 ring (30”), 6 ring (36”) and the 5 ring (42”).  The bullseye section of the target (7 ring to 10X ring) may be replaced with Target Repair Center (NSN 6920-00-999-1437). 10.9.1.2.  Bulls-eye targets are used to zero weapons.  During all other phases that require hits to be within the black, a 24” steel reactionary target’s representing an engine block may  be  used.    For  800-meter  target,  a  30”  X  42”  steel  target  representing  the  front  of vehicle may be used. 10.9.1.3.  This  course  of fire  is  designed to  be conducted on a 600 to  800-meter known distance range, with a target pit.  When using a range without a target pit, Combat Arms may use either of the following methods to mark target hits.  Have students or instructors gone down range to mark hits or have instructors spot hits using spotting scopes or field glasses.  Instructors must ensure targets are replaced before starting the evaluation phase of the course.  (T-1).  Combat Arms may also use reactionary targets, as long as they are set  to  react  to  hits  in  the  designated  areas  of  the  target.    When  the  maximum  target distance is limited to 600 meters, Combat Arms may substitute 600-meter targets for the 800-meter targets designated in the course of fire. 10.9.2.  Course Standards: 10.9.2.1.  Zero and Practice orders:  Shooters shoot one round at a time, pit operators pull and  mark  hits  between  each  shot.    This  allows  shooters  to  develop  solid  shooting fundaments  through  instant  target  feedback.    During  zero,  shooters  should  have  three consecutive  rounds  within  the  X  ring  to  be  considered  zeroed.    Rounds  not  used  are returned to ammo stocks.  During Order 3, the first 4 rounds are marked or recorded after each shot.  Then conduct a 4-round quick fire and mark or record all 4 hits, then repeat the process.  When class size permits, the coach/shooter method should be used to help build confidence.  When using a target pit, pit personnel paste old hits while marking new hits prior to exposing targets. 10.9.2.2.  Qualification Orders of fire:  Start all qualification orders with shooter’s cheek off weapon as if scanning the principle direction of fire (PDF). 10.9.2.2.1.  Phase III, Order 1 - Qualified; 4 hits in black portion of target. 10.9.2.2.2.  Phase III, Orders 2, 3 and 4 - Qualified; 6 hits in black portion of target. 10.9.2.2.3.  Phase III, Order 5 - Qualified; 6 hits.  Only hits within the top and bottom 7  ring  and  left  and  right  5  ring  (30”  X  42”)  count.    This  simulates  the  front  of  a vehicle.   162  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 10.9.2.2.4.  Phase III, Orders 6 and 7 - Qualified; 4 hits in black portion of target. 10.9.2.2.5.  When more than 50% of the bullet hole is within a ring, the hit is counted for that scoring ring. 10.9.3.  Course Notes AFQC. 10.9.3.1.  The tower operator or Chief Range Officer (CRO) is responsible for controlling firing line proceedings and target pit operations. 10.9.3.2.  During  all  orders  of  fire,  the  CRO  notifies  the  pit  officer  (PO)  of  firing operations at the beginning and end of each order. 10.9.4.  The PO ensures all targets are in the half up position at the start of each order of fire and  does  not  raise  them  until  the  CRO  notifies  the  pit  the  range  is  ready.    The  PO  is  also responsible  for  ensuring  all  targets  are  raised  at  the  start  of  the  order  of  fire  and  that  all targets are lowered down at the end. 10.9.4.1.  During all orders of fire, the CRO notifies the PO of the start of an order prior to making the line ready.  Once the PO orders targets to the “ready” (half-up) position the CRO makes the line ready.  Once line is ready, the CRO contacts the PO.  If challenges are made, the CRO contacts the PO and informs them of the challenges and firing point numbers. 10.9.4.2.  The  PO  is  responsible  for  target  operation.    The  PO  briefs  target  pullers  on proper operation of targets and target systems.  The PO ensures target pullers run targets to the full up position when firing is in progress. 10.9.4.3.  During qualification orders, the PO raises the targets to the half up position and stands  by.    Once  the  PO  receives  “the  line  is  ready”  from  the  CRO,  the  PO  notifies operators  by  shouting,  “Stand  By”  then  “Targets  Up.”    The  PO  starts  the  time  for  the order when the last target reaches the full up position.  The PO shouts “Stand By” prior to the end of the time limit then at the end of the time limit, the PO shouts “Targets Down.”  The target pullers score the targets. 10.9.5.  WARNING:  Inspect all magazines at the end of training to ensure they do not contain live rounds. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   163  Figure 10.1.  M107 AFQC Target and Scoring. 10.10.  Target Information, M107 Rifle AFQC.  10.10.1.  The  Bulls-Eye  Target  (NSN  6920-00-900-8205)  has  10X,  10,  9,  8,  7,  6  and  5 scoring rings.  When more than 50% of the bullet hole is within a ring, score the hit as being in that scoring ring.  The target pit is the area where the targets and target holders are located and where target pit personnel raise, lower and mark targets.  Normally, target pit personnel raise the targets to expose them to the shooter and lower the targets to conceal them and for target scoring/marking.  Most ranges have earthen berms or other material built up to protect target pit personnel and target mechanisms from fired rounds.  The targets are suspended on frames above the protective berm.  During zero and practice orders, after a round is fired by the shooter, the target  is pulled down into the pit  by the target puller.   A colored disk on a spindle is inserted into the bullet hole to show the shooter where the shot hit the target and a large disk is hung on the periphery of the target to denote the value of the shot.  The number on  the  disk  placed  on  the  periphery  corresponds  with  the  value  of  the  scoring  ring  on  the target  where  the  hit  struck.    Once  target  marking  and  repair  operations  are  complete,  the target  puller  raises  the  target  so  the  shooter  can  see  where  the  shots  hit  the  target.    On  the next shot, the target is again pulled down, the colored disk is relocated to the new shot, the old bullet hole is patched and if necessary the disk on the periphery of the target is moved to the value of the new shot, then the target is raised so the shooter can see it. 10.10.2.  During  the  qualification  orders,  after  the  time  limit  expires  for  the  final  order  of fire, the targets are pulled into the pits and the puller inserts small disks on spindles into each bullet  hole.    A  large  disk  is  placed  in  the  10  value  for  a  Qualification  score  or  in  the  miss value for Unqualified score.  After the shooter examines and records his shots, the targets are pulled into the pits,  all disks are removed, holes are patched and the targets are readied for the next order/phase. 10.10.3.  The CRO notifies the PO of any challenges on a score during qualification and the PO rescored the target to verify the score.  The PO’s score is recorded as the final score.   164  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 10.10.4.  Use the following spotters to mark hits at the specified range. 10.10.4.1.  Use  a  1-inch  spotter  (6920-00-789-0864)  for  100  meters/yards  through  300 meters/yards. 10.10.4.2.  Use  a  3-inch  spotter  (6920-00-713-8255)  for  400  meters/yards  through  600 meters/yards. 10.10.4.3.  Use  a  5-inch  spotter  (6920-00-713-8254)  for  all  ranges  in  excess  of  600 meters/yards. 10.10.4.4.  Use  a  10-inch  spotter  (6920-00-713-8256)  for  shot  values  and  Q  and  UQ values. 10.10.4.5.  Use target spotter spindle (6920-00-713-8257) with all spotters. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   165  Chapter 11 LONG RANGE PRECISION RIFLE TRAINING PROGRAMS 11.1.  Long  Range  Precision  Rifle  Training:  The  AF  employs  long  range  precision  rifle capabilities using personnel trained and qualified on two distinct programs with an AF approved long range precision rifle (e.g.,  M24 rifle or M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System [SASS]) and associated equipment (e.g.,  Mk 4 Day Optic Sight and AN/PVS-10 Sniper Night Scope).  The Sharpshooter  AFQC  will  only  be  used  to  train/qualify  authorized  personnel  assigned  to  units with special mission sets (e.g., 820th Base Defense Group and Contingency Response Groups).  (T-1).    All  other  personnel  with  long  range  precision  rifle  requirements  will  complete  the Advanced Designated Marksman (ADM) AFQC.  (T-1).  This course only applies to personnel who will use the long range precision rifle in the Sharpshooter or ADM role.  It does not apply to other roles such as Guardian Angel employment of the M110 SASS or SF/Explosive Ordnance Disposal  (EOD)  employment  of  the  M107  for  anti-material  purposes.    This  manual  contains separate qualification training programs for these methods of employment. 11.2.  USAF  Sharpshooter  AFQC:  The  AF  Close  Precision  Engagement  Course  (CPEC) conducts all initial Sharpshooter AFQC training/qualification.  The AFSFC manages the CPEC and  determines  the  location  of  this  course.    The  AFSFC  designates  the  location  authorized  to conduct  the  CPEC  and  complete  initial  Sharpshooter  AFQC  qualification.    This  course  is  very specialized  and  designed  to  support  the  unique  requirements  of  Sharpshooter  training.    The CPEC  provides  the  minimum  training,  tactics,  techniques,  procedures  and  performance evaluations for qualification with a long range precision rifle as a USAF Sharpshooter.  Because of  the  dynamic  nature  of  this  requirement  and  the  need  to  continually  adjust  training  to  meet changing  combat  capability  needs,  as  well  as  the  limited  number  of  students,  the  CPEC  staff develops the course guidance (the initial course of fire, course objectives, and lesson plans), with review by AFSFC/FGWL and approval from HQ USAF/A4SX.  The CPEC staff will submit the course guidance to AFSFC/FGWL for review and AFSFC/FGWL submits their recommendation to HQ USAF/A4SX for approval.  (T-1).  Due to the limited application, the training objectives, lesson plan(s) and course of fire are not included in this publication.  Unless otherwise specified as  optional,  personnel  fire  both  the  practice  and  evaluation  phases  of  fire  to  be  considered qualified.    Satisfactory  completion  of  the  CPEC  Sharpshooter  AFQC  qualifies  individuals  for arming as required by AFI 31-117 and AFI 36-2654.  The CPEC staff enters this training into the Security Forces Management Information System (SFMIS) as initial Sharpshooter AFQC for all students. 11.2.1.  After  initial  qualification  at  the  CPEC,  Sharpshooters  must  follow  the  sustainment and  recurring  training  guidance  for  the  ADM  AFQC  contained  in  this  chapter  to  remain qualified on a long range precision rifle.  (T-1). 11.2.2.  Combat  Arms  personnel  enter  this  qualification  training  in  SFMIS  as  Sharpshooter AFQC (recurring). 11.3.  Advanced  Designated  Marksman  (ADM)  AFQC:  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force members  with  the  minimum  training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance, handling,  marksmanship  skills  and  performance  evaluations  required  for  qualification  with  a long  range  precision  rifle  as  an  ADM.    Unless  otherwise  specified  as  optional,  personnel  fire   166  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 both the practice and evaluation phases of fire to be considered qualified.  The ADM AFQC is an advanced/specialized  course  fired  for  initial  and  recurring  training.    The  following  paragraphs outline the ADM AFQC requirements. 11.4.  Training Overview. 11.4.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student’s  first  participation  in  the  ADM  qualification course.    Initial  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  performance  evaluations,  passing all training objectives in Table 11.1 and qualifying at known and unknown distances on the long  range  precision  rifle  using  Table  11.2,  Table  11.3  &  Table  11.4    Initial  training  is accomplished at the CPEC or at base level if units meet all range and personnel requirements.  Satisfactory  completion  of  the  ADM  AFQC  at  the  CPEC  or  base  level  constitutes qualification  training  as  required  by  AFI  31-117  and  AFI  36-2654.    If  this  training  is performed at the CPEC, its staff enters this training into SFMIS as initial ADM AFQC. 11.4.2.  Recurring  Training.    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial  qualification.    This training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  known  and  unknown  distance targets,  and  passing  mechanical  evaluations.    Weapons  safety  procedures  and  the  training objectives in Table 11.5 and qualifying on the long range precision rifle using Table 11.6 are the minimum mandatory items required for recurring training.  Certified instructors conduct recurring qualification training semiannually during the alternating quarters after completing unit level sustainment training.  The CY quarterly cycles are outlined in paragraph 11.4.3.2.  Academic training is only conducted once per annual cycle and in conjunction with the first qualification training of each annual cycle.  Note:  Instructors who qualify for the purpose of providing  instruction  are  not  required  to  complete  quarterly  sustainment  and/or  recurring qualification and only qualify on the recurring ADM AFQC annually to maintain instructor certification.  These  individuals are not  authorized to  be armed  with  a long  range precision rifle or perform Sharpshooter or ADM duties. 11.4.3.  Unit Level Sustainment.  This is semiannual training conducted at the home unit and is  accomplished  by  the  last  day  of  the  required  quarters  for  the  ADM  to  remain  qualified.  ADM  personnel  conduct  this  training  on  their  own  to  maintain  proficiency  during  the alternating quarters after completing the recurring ADM AFQC.  Qualified ADM personnel, with assistance from unit training section personnel, conduct training on ADM skills during sustainment  training.    ADM  personnel  use  the  recurring  ADM  AFQC  for  sustainment training  as  a  baseline  live-fire  course  and  may  modify  the  course  of  fire  to  meet  mission specific objectives.  Modifications are approved by the base level Combat Arms NCOIC and Combat Arms organizational commander. 11.4.3.1.  ADM  personnel  must  meet  all  range  safety  officer  certification  and  other requirements to safely operate the range before being allowed to conduct training without Combat  Arms  personnel  present.    (T-1).    These  requirements  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    Any  host  range  requirements  are  in  addition  to  those  contained  in  AFI  36-2654 and range officer personnel must meet both Air Force and host range requirements.  (T-1). 11.4.3.2.  Units  should  use  calendar  year  (CY)  quarters  to  conduct  the  ADM  unit  level sustainment  training  and  recurring  qualification  cycle.    The  first  sustainment  training quarter is the CY quarter immediately after the CY quarter the member completes initial qualification.  For example, if the member completes initial qualification in Feb 15 (first AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   167  quarter of CY) they complete sustainment training by 30 Jun 15 (end of second quarter of CY).  The next CY quarter they complete recurring qualification.  In this example, they are  required  to  qualify  by  30  Sep  15.    This  cycle  continues,  alternating  between sustainment  training  and  recurring  qualification  each  CY  quarter.    The  following  is  an example of the cycle for a member who completed initial ADM qualification on 17 Apr 15: 11.4.3.2.1.  Sustainment training due by 30 Sep 15. 11.4.3.2.2.  Recurring qualification due by 31 Dec 15. 11.4.3.2.3.  Sustainment training due by 31 Mar 16. 11.4.3.2.4.  Recurring qualification due by 30 Jun 16. 11.4.3.2.5.  This  quarterly  cycle,  alternating  between  sustainment  training  and recurring qualification, continues until an arming requirement no longer exists. 11.4.4.  Remedial  Training.    This  is  in-depth  training  needed  to  correct  marksmanship  or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to personnel who failed an evaluation.  Same day refires or on-the-spot corrections are not remedial training. 11.5.  Instructor Guidelines. 11.5.1.  Classroom Instructor Requirements. 11.5.1.1.  Initial  (Unit  Level)  ADM  AFQC.  Instructors for objectives marked with an asterisk (*) in Table 11.1 must be certified Combat Arms personnel (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD  civilian  equivalent)  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    These  individuals  must successfully complete the initial Sharpshooter or ADM AFQC conducted at the CPEC or at  base  level  before  being  lead  instructor  certified.    (T-1).    Currently  qualified Sharpshooter or ADM personnel (AFSC 3P0X1X or DoD civilian equivalent) who have successfully completed the initial Sharpshooter or  ADM AFQC conducted at  the CPEC may instruct objectives in Table 11.1 that are not identified with an asterisk (non-Combat Arms objectives).  Non-Combat Arms instructors must complete the qualifications for SF S-3/Training  Section  personnel  outlined  in  AFI  36-2646,  Security  Forces  Training  and Standardization  Evaluation  Programs.    (T-1).    These  individuals  must  also  complete instructor evaluations on the ADM AFQC objectives they instruct as required by AFI 36-2654  for  initial  certification  and  annually  thereafter  to  maintain  certification.    (T-1).  Note:    Although  certified  non-Combat  Arms  personnel  as  outlined  above  may  perform lead  instructor  duties  for  some  objectives,  Combat  Arms  will  provide  oversight  of classroom operations to ensure compliance with AFI 36-2654 requirements.  (T-1). 11.5.1.2.  Recurring  ADM  AFQC.    Instructors  for  objectives  marked  with  an  asterisk (*)  in  Table  11.5  must  be  certified  Combat  Arms  personnel  (AFSC  3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD  civilian  equivalent)  as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.    These  individuals  must successfully  complete  the  recurring  ADM  AFQC  at  unit  level  or  meet  the  requirements outlined in paragraph 11.5.1.1, as well as the requirements for lead instructor certification contained  in  AFI  36-2654.    Instructors  for  non-Combat  Arms  objectives  must  meet  the requirements in paragraph 11.5.1.1.  (T-1).   168  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 11.5.1.3.  CPEC  Staff.    Instructors  may  be  certified  Combat  Arms  personnel  (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) or qualified Sharpshooter or ADM personnel (AFSC 3P0X1X or DoD civilian equivalent).  Instructors must successfully complete the initial Sharpshooter or ADM AFQC conducted at the CPEC.  (T-1).  Instructors must also complete  the  CPEC  ADM  Instructor  Course  when  available.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms personnel  are  preferred  for  lead  instructor  duties.    Non-Combat  Arms  instructors  must complete  the  qualifications  for  SF  S-3/Training  Section  personnel  outlined  in  AFI  36-2646.    (T-1).    All  instructors  must  also  complete  instructor  evaluations  on  the  ADM AFQC  objectives  they  instruct  as  required  by  AFI  36-2654  for  initial  lead  instructor certification  and  annually  thereafter  to  maintain  certification.    (T-1).    Note:    Although certified  non-Combat  Arms  personnel  as  outlined  above  may  perform  lead  instructor duties,  Combat  Arms  will  provide  oversight  of  classroom  operations  to  ensure compliance with AFI 36-2654 requirements.  (T-1). 11.5.1.4.  Classroom  instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands on weapons training.  Instructors should associate the various skills taught during training to  real  life  scenarios.    This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and procedures used to effectively utilize their weapons.  Instructor to student ratio is 1 to 7. 11.5.2.  Range  Firing  Line  Officials.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as needed during grouping, zeroing, practice and between evaluation orders of fire.  Each firing point  instructor  conducts  the  course  of  fire,  to  include  monitoring  time  limits,  at  the  firing point.  To ensure safe range operations, close communication is essential between the range safety instructor, tower operator and all firing point instructors.  Instructor to student ratio is 1 to 1.  These individuals must meet the requirements in AFI 36-2654 for these duties.  (T-1). 11.5.3.  Tower  Operator.  This  individual  must  be  a  certified  Combat  Arms  instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  (T-1).  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 11.5.4.  Refer to AFI 36-2654 for detailed requirements and qualifications for these positions.  The requirements in paragraphs 11.5.2 and 11.5.3 apply to live-fire qualification conducted at the CPEC. 11.6.  Initial  ADM  AFQC  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following  paragraphs  is intended  to  provide instruction  standardization.   This  program  is  mandatory  for  initial  training.

Course Information, (Recurring) ADM AFQC. 11.9.5.1.  Targets for the course: 11.9.5.1.1.  Target  “Z”  is  a  2  inch  square  paster  affixed  and  centered  on  the  “E” silhouette backer.  The paster is placed with the corners vertical and horizontal to aid shooters in centering the scope cross hairs. 11.9.5.1.2.  Target  “E”  is  the  kneeling  silhouette  target  (NSN  6920-00-600-6874) with 10” lethal zone (chest) circle or a steel target of the same shape and dimensions may  be  used.    If  steel  is  used,  instructors  paint  a  10  inch  lethal  zone  circle  on  the target chest.  For both targets, use the standard Handgun AFQC target template. 11.9.5.2.  Target configuration for the course: 11.9.5.2.1.  Phase  I,  Grouping  and  Zero:    100-yard  “E”  target  with  2  inch  paster.  Note:  Throughout this course,  target distances are in  yards or  meters, based on the design of the range used, regardless of how they are expressed in the course notes. 11.9.5.2.2.  Phase  II  and  III,  Known  Distance  Practice  and  Evaluation:    “E”  targets are located at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 meters/yards.  The 100, 200 and 300-yard targets have the 10” lethal zone (chest) marked on the target. 11.9.5.2.3.  Phase IV, Unknown Distance Evaluation:  For firing orders 1 and 2, the five unknown distance  targets are located at varying distances  of 100-175, 250-300, 325-375,  400-425  and  475-600  meters/yards.    Instructors  place  the  targets  at  their discretion  as  long  as  the  distance  falls  within  those  listed  above.    For  firing  order  3 (rapid  fire),  five  “E”  targets  are  placed  at  200  meters/yards  and  grouped  within approximately  5m  of  each  other.    The  targets  are  arranged  in  a  linear  fashion  as  if walking in a loose single file formation. 11.9.5.2.4.  Phase V, Night Scope Zero:  Use a 100-yard “E” target with 2 inch paster as used in Phase I Zero. 11.9.5.2.5.  Phase  VI,  Night  Unknown  Distance  Evaluation:    The  same  five  “E” targets used in Phase IV (Day Unknown Distance Evaluation) are used. 11.9.5.3.  Course  standards.    In  order  to  qualify  on  the  weapon,  personnel  need  to  do more  than  simply  hit  a  target  the  minimum  number  of  times.    They  also  need  to demonstrate:  safe  weapon  handling  procedures,  the  ability  to  operate  the  weapon  and   200  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 maintain the weapon and equipment unassisted.  In order to qualify on the course of fire, students  achieve  a  qualifying  score  on  each  phase  of  the  course  and  meet  all  training objectives before progressing to the next phase of fire. 11.9.5.3.1.  Phase  I,  Grouping  and  Zero:    Students  achieve  a  1  inch  shot  group centered  within  the  2  inch  paster.    Students  conduct  all  sight  adjustments  without instructor assistance. 11.9.5.3.2.  Phase  II,  Known  Distance  Practice:    For  each  firing  order,  students successfully engage each target with at least one hit within time limits.  The 100, 200 and 300-yard targets must be hit within the 10 inch chest circle and the 400, 500 and 600-yard targets only require a hit anywhere on the target.  (T-1).  Ensure all targets are successfully engaged to progress to the next phase of fire. 11.9.5.3.3.  Phase III, Known Distance Evaluation:  For this phase of fire, targets are engaged in random order as called out by the instructor.  Target numbers are based on the  range  card  constructed  by  the  students  and  provided  to  the  instructor.    For  each firing order, students fire nine rounds at six targets arranged in 100-yard increments from  100-600  meters/yards  and  within  the  time  limit.    Targets  from  100-300 meters/yards  must  be  hit  within  the 10  inch  chest  circle  while  targets  from  400-600 meters/yards  only  require  a  hit  anywhere  on  the  target  body.    (T-1).    To  receive  a qualifying score students successfully engage five out of six targets to progress to the next phase of fire. 11.9.5.3.4.  Phase  IV,  Unknown  Distance  Evaluation:    For  firing  orders  1  and  2, students fire five rounds at five randomly spaced targets from 200-600 meters/yards.  Students range and engage each target from nearest to farthest within the time limit.  For firing order 3 (rapid fire), students range and engage a group of five targets within the time limit.  To qualify, all targets are successfully engaged. 11.9.5.3.5.  Phase  V,  Night  Scope  Zero:    For  this  phase  of  fire,  students  install  and zero  the  night  scope  without  instructor  assistance.    The  night  scope  is  zeroed  using the same method as described in Phase I, Grouping and Zero. 11.9.5.3.6.  Phase  VI,  Night  Unknown  Distance  Evaluation:    For  this  phase  of  fire, students  engage  the  same  targets  used  in  Phase  IV,  Unknown  Distance  Evaluation.  For all firing orders, students fire 10 rounds at 5 targets from 100-500 meters/yards.  To qualify, only hits to the body count with all targets successfully engaged. 11.9.5.4.  General Course Notes, (Recurring) ADM AFQC. 11.9.5.4.1.  Students  fire  the entire course  while  wearing issued  ICE:   Helmet,  body armor and LBE/LBV. 11.9.5.4.2.  During  practice/training  phases,  instructors  supervise  students  as  needed during  weapons  handling  procedures  to  include  safety,  clearing,  loading,  reloading and application of immediate/remedial action procedures.  During evaluation phases, students complete all weapons handling procedures without instructor assistance.  If an  unsafe  condition  develops  such  as  a  light  recoil  or  failure  to  extract,  instructors immediately act to ensure the safety of all personnel.  Students, who run out of time due  to  stoppages,  are  considered  “alibis”  and  instructors  can  pro-rate  time  to  allow AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   201  them to complete the string of fire.  The objective is for students to demonstrate the ability  to  operate  the  weapon  without  assistance,  while  instructors  maintain  a  safe training environment. 11.9.5.4.3.  Students  who  commit  safety  violations  are  immediately  warned  and corrected.    If  they  continue  to  violate  weapon  or  range  safety  rules,  they  should  be promptly  removed  from  the  range  until  they  receive  remedial  training  and  can demonstrate  the  ability  to  consistently  apply  weapon  safety  rules.    Students  who violate  the  following  safety  rules  are  considered  a  “No-Go”  and  are  not  allowed  to continue  the  course  until  remedial  training  has  been  completed  and  they  pass  a performance check. 11.9.5.4.4.  To  correct  shooting  errors,  instructors  may  provide  additional  rounds during Grouping and Zero and all teaching/practice orders.  Identify additional rounds on the AF Form 710. 11.9.5.4.5.  Eye and hearing protection is used by all personnel on the range. 11.9.5.4.6.  WARNING:  Instructors inspect  all  weapons,  magazines  and magazine  pouches  at  the  end  of  training  to  ensure  they  do  not  contain  live rounds.  See AFI 36-2654 for additional range operation procedures.   202  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 12 M240B MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM 12.1.  M240B  Machine  Gun  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the minimum  training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship skills  and  performance  evaluations  required  for  qualification  with  the  M240B  Machine  Gun.  Note:  Any personnel, regardless of arming group, who are authorized and will be equipped with night aiming or night scope devices (AN/PEQ-15, AN/PAS-13D[E] V2, etc.) should successfully complete academic instruction and the applicable phases of Phase VI, Night Vision Optics and Laser  Aiming  Devices  Training,  and  Phase  VII,  Night  Scope  Training.    The  gunner  zeroes  the aiming devices/sights they take on deployment or with which they are armed with in-garrison. 12.1.1.  Individual Machine Gunner.  A machine gunner is qualified to tactically employ the M240B in the bipod mode (from 300 to 800 meters), when vehicle mounted and has met the training requirements mandated within this chapter. 12.1.2.  Crew-Served Machine Gunner.  A machine gunner is qualified to tactically employ the  M240B  in  all  modes  with  the  aid  of  an  assistant  gunner  upon  meeting  the  training requirements  mandated  within  this  chapter.    Assistant  machine  gunners  must  complete  the same  training  program  and  meet  the  same  qualification  standards  as  primary  machine gunners.  (T-1). 12.1.3.  The  MAJCOM/A4S  in  coordination  with  AFSFC/FGWL  may  direct  the  level  of M240B training (Crew-Served or Individual) that Security Forces personnel complete for in-garrison arming.  If individuals employ the weapon from the bipod and/or vehicle only, they may qualify to the Individual Machine Gunner standard. 12.1.3.1.  If  the  weapon  is  employed  from  a  vehicle,  the  individual  must  satisfactorily complete  Phase  V,  Vehicle  Firing.    (T-1).    Personnel  trained  to  the  Individual  standard are not authorized to employ the weapon from the tripod or in a crew-served mode. 12.1.3.2.  Security  Forces  personnel  completing  M240B  qualification  for  deployment must complete training to the Crew-Served standard.  (T-1).  If an individual is qualified to the Individual level and their qualification has not expired, they only need to complete the additional training (classroom and live-fire) to meet the Crew-Served standard.  When an  individual  only  completes  the  Crew-Served  portions  of  the  training,  their  original Individual  Machine  Gunner  qualification  expiration  date  remains  unchanged  and  is  not extended. 12.2.  Training Overview. 12.2.1.  Initial Machine Gunner Qualification.  This is the student’s first participation in the M240B  Individual  Qualification  Training  Program.    Initial  training  consists  of  classroom instruction, performance evaluations, passing all applicable training objectives in Table 12.1 and  qualifying  on  the  M240B  Machine  Gun  AFQC.    Full  distance  (AFQC/FD)  training  is preferred;  the  use  of  10-meter  initial  qualification  should  only  be  used  as  a  last  resort.  AFSFC/FGWL may grant individual bases permission to qualify personnel using Table 12.3 as an initial 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) when full distance range facilities cannot be used.  The AF Form 522 reflects a 12-month qualification. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   203  12.2.2.  Live-fire  Recurring  Training  (12-Month).    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial qualification.    This  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  M240B Machine Gun AFQC (Full Distance or 10-Meter) and passing mechanical evaluations.  The required  frequencies  for  recurring  training  and  qualification  are  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654.  AFQC/FD  training  is  preferred;  the  use  of  10-meter  recurring  qualification  should  only  be used  as  a  last  resort.    AFSFC/FGWL  may  grant  individual  bases  permission  to  qualify personnel using Table 12.3 as a recurring 10-meter course (AFQC/10M) when full distance range  facilities  cannot  be  used.    This  evaluation  is  completed  on  an  annual  basis  for  all machine  gunners.    Non-Security  Forces  personnel  moving  from  individual  to  crew  served status must meet all the requirements as mandated in this manual.  (T-1).  The AF Form 522 reflects a 12-month qualification. 12.2.3.  Remedial  Training.    This  is  in-depth  training  needed  to  correct  marksmanship  or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to personnel who failed an evaluation.  Same day refires or on-the-spot corrections are not remedial training. 12.2.4.  Unit Training.  Refresher training on operator skills and knowledge provided by units to help maintain individual's proficiency.  Units should conduct this training before exercises and deployments. 12.2.5.  Performance  Evaluation.    Performance  evaluations,  included  in  the  Air  Force approved lesson plans, require weapon operator skills certification.  Combat Arms completes evaluations  for  initial,  as  well  as  recurring  training  for  both  individual  and  crew-served personnel. 12.2.6.  If AFSFC/FGWL has waived the requirement for the night fire portions of the course as  outlined  in  AFI  36-2654,  Combat  Arms  still  completes  academic  training,  performance evaluations and conducts dry-fire on these skills/objectives using all night vision and aiming equipment shooters have issued to them. 12.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 12.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. 12.3.2.  Range.  Instructors supervise and coach/teach students as needed during pre-fire set-up,  zeroing,  practice  and  between  evaluation  orders  of  fire.    Each  firing  point  instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations, close communication is essential between the range safety instructor, tower operator and all firing point instructors.  See AFI 36-2654 for instructor requirements and student to instructor ratios. 12.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the   204  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 12.4.  M240B  Machine  Gun  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following paragraphs  is  intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for initial and recurring training.  Students must meet and be evaluated to the performance standards of the applicable training objectives listed in Table  12.1  (T-1).  Exception:  If student(s) will not  employ  the  machine  gun  from  the  vehicle  (only  applicable  for  non-Security  Forces)  or  if AFSFC/FGWL has waived the vehicle firing requirement, students do not have to be evaluated on  the  training  objectives  for  vehicle  firing  listed  in  Table  12.1  or  complete  the  vehicle  firing portions  of  the  qualification  course.    Note:    Training  times  may  vary  depending  on  class  size, student experience level, range location, etc.  Approximate training times for this program are: 12.4.1.  Initial/Recurring training (All Phases) – 40 to 48 hours. 12.4.2.  Initial/Recurring training (Bipod Only - Phases I, II, and V) – 13 to 20 hours. 12.4.3.  Remedial and unit training – as needed. 12.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to tactically employ the M240B against enemy targets and maintain the weapon  to  the  level  authorized  for  the  operator.    With  the  exception  of  operator  maintenance (care  and  cleaning),  Combat  Arms  evaluates  the  students’  ability  to  perform  all  tasks  without assistance. 12.6.  Training  Objectives.  The  training  objectives  required  for  successful  completion  of  this program are listed in Table 12.1 The student must understand, demonstrate and apply: 12.6.1.  Safety rules and procedures.  (T-1). 12.6.2.  Characteristics, nomenclature and types of ammunition.  (T-1). 12.6.3.  Stoppages and malfunctions.  (T-1). 12.6.4.  Roles of the M240B.  (T-1). 12.6.5.

Double  "E"  silhouette  targets,  empty  55-gallon  drums, salvaged vehicles or mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets.  Gunners  who  will  employ  the  weapon  using  an  optical  aiming  device,  such  as  the  M145 Machine Gun Optic, will complete all day-fire orders using the optic.  (T-1). 12.10.2.  Course Standards. 12.10.2.1.  The entire course of fire is based on the students’ ability to fire a 6 to 9-round burst during training and is used to teach firing discipline and the tactical employment of the  machine  gun.    In  an  actual  real-world  scenario,  the  shooter  would  continue  to  fire (sustained, rapid or cyclic) until the threat is eliminated. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   215  12.10.2.2.  Gunners  initial  lay  on  all  targets  at  midpoint.    After  the  initial  burst,  the gunner  moves  to  the  closest  part  of  the  target  to  the  gunner,  then  moves  to  the  farthest point  from  the  gunner  and  finally  back  to  the  midpoint.    Instructors  ensure  targets  are large enough to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.  Gunners ensure the beaten zones overlap while firing.  This technique is used for training and simulates no known threat.  In real-life situations, gunners tactically engage the  portion  of  the  target  posing  the  greatest  threat  to  themselves  or  the  gun  position.  Gunners  do  not  fire  and  make  T&E  mechanism  adjustments  at  the  same  time;  the technique used is fire, adjust T&E mechanism, fire and so on. 12.10.2.3.  During  qualification,  ammunition  belts  should  be  divided  up  to  match  the required  rounds  for  each  order  of  fire.    Ensure  the  AF  Forms  522  and  710  reflect  the correct number of rounds fired by the student. 12.10.2.4.  Qualification standards are contained in the course of fire. 12.10.2.5.  On all evaluation phases, if the beaten zone covers the target, it is considered a hit. 12.10.3.  Course Notes. 12.10.3.1.  Instructors teach students as needed during the practice phase/orders.  During evaluation phases, instructors can help students between orders of fire, as needed, correct safety infractions and supervise how students apply immediate action procedures. 12.10.3.2.  Assistant  gunners  are  not  used  for  Phases  I,  II  or  V,  but  are  mandatory  for Phases III and IV.  On those phases where an assistant gunner is used, assistant gunners give all fire corrections to the gunners (with the exception of zero).  Ensure students are equipped with the appropriate tripod, T&E mechanism and spare barrel kit.  Gun crews wear issued ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), Nomex  gloves,  gas  mask  carrier  (with  gas  mask  and  protective  gloves),  eye  protection and hearing protection during all firing orders. 12.10.3.3.  Sight corrections may be made at any time throughout the course. 12.10.3.4.  All orders in Phases I, II, VI, and VII are fired in the bipod mode. 12.10.3.5.  On  all  orders,  gunners  engage  targets  as  a  single  gun  covering  the  entire target. 12.10.3.6.  After  completing  Phase  I,  Order  4  and  Phase  II,  Order  2,  the  firing  point instructor  gives  the  command  “Gas,  Gas,  Gas”  and  the  gun  crew  immediately  puts  the gun on Safe and dons the gas mask and gloves.  The gunner then engages the area target. 12.10.3.7.  Phase  V  is  mandatory  for  personnel  completing  qualification  to  support UTC’s  requiring  vehicle  mounted  weapons  and  optional  for  in-garrison  requirements  to fill mission training needs for individual units.  (T-1).  For qualification to support UTC requirements,  Combat  Arms  requires  an  approved  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL  for  any portion  of  this  phase  that  they  cannot  complete  because  of  range  limitations  or  other limiting  factors.    A  waiver  is  not  required  for  in-garrison  requirements.    In  Phase  V, gunners use one area target at 300 meters with at least four double "E" silhouettes or 55-gallon  drums.    Position  the  vehicle  parallel  to  the  firing  line  with  the  weapon  pointed down range (perpendicular to the vehicle).  When conducting moving vehicle firing, the   216  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 vehicle should move parallel to the firing line at a speed of 3 to 5 miles per hour (mph).  Note:  Combat Arms sections without the capability to conduct live-fire vehicle training may  request  approval  from  AFSFC/FGWL  to  use  the  procedures  in  paragraph 12.11.4.7.1. from the 10-meter qualification course. 12.10.3.8.  Phase  VI  and  VII  are  mandatory  for  personnel  conducting  qualification  in support of UTC’s using STANO equipment and optional for in-garrison requirements to fill  mission  training  needs  for  individual  units.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  requires  an approved  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL  for  any  portion  of  these  phases  that  they  cannot complete because of range limitations or other limiting factors. 12.10.3.9.  Should  gunners  fail  to  achieve  a  qualified  score  on  any  order,  they  are unqualified.  However, if re-fired within 30 days, gunners need only refire and qualify on those orders failed on the previous attempt.  After 30 days, gunners must refire the entire course.  (T-1). 12.10.3.10.  AF  Form  522  need  only  reflect  qualified  "Q"  or  unqualified  "UQ"  for  the entire course.  However, instructors annotate (in the remarks block of the AF Form 522) any  phase/order  on  which  the  student  fails  to  qualify  after  any  re-fires  as  outlined  in paragraph 12.10.3.9.  A numerical score is not required in the score block of AF Forms 522 or 710. 12.10.3.11.  Instructors  enter  the  models  of  small  arms  STANO  equipment  (e.g., AN/PEQ-15  or  AN/PAS-13  V2)  the  individual  qualified  with  in  the  remarks  section  of the AF Form 522. 12.10.3.12.  Instructors  enter  the  phase(s)  of  the course  not  completed  by  the  individual and cite the waiver/deviation authorization source in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Note: Home-station deviations (e.g., gas mask or night fire phases) may not meet the CCMD requirements. Table 12.3.

Course Information:  AFQC/10M: 12.11.1.  Targets for the Course.  Use the 10-meter machine gun target for Phases I-IV (NSN 6920-00-078-5123).    Double  "E"  silhouette  targets,  empty  55-gallon  drums,  salvaged vehicles or mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets for Phase V  (see  paragraph  12.11.4.7.  for  Phase  V  course  notes).    Gunners  who  will  employ  the weapon using an optical aiming device, such as the M145 Machine Gun Optic, will complete all day-fire orders using the optic.  (T-1). 12.11.2.  Half-loading:    Half-loading,  unloading  from  a  half-load  and  clearing  from  a  half load is only authorized per the operator’s manual.  Perform all loading operations using the full-load procedures for weapons not authorized the use of a half-load. 12.11.3.  Course Standards. 12.11.3.1.  The entire course of fire is based on the students’ ability to fire a 6 to 9-round burst during training and is used to teach firing discipline and the tactical employment of the  machine  gun.    In  an  actual  real-world  scenario,  the  shooter  would  continue  to  fire (sustained, rapid or cyclic) until the threat is eliminated. 12.11.3.2.  Gunners  initial  lay  on  all  targets  at  midpoint.    After  the  initial  burst,  the gunner  moves  to  the  closest  part  of  the  target  to  the  gunner,  then  moves  to  the  farthest point  from  the  gunner  and  finally  back  to  the  midpoint.    Instructors  ensure  targets  are large enough to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.  Gunners ensure the beaten zones overlap while firing.  This technique is used for training and simulates no known threat.  In real-life situations, gunners tactically engage the  portion  of  the  target  posing  the  greatest  threat  to  themselves  or  the  gun  position.  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   219  Gunners  do  not  fire  and  make  T&E  mechanism  adjustments  at  the  same  time;  the technique used is fire, adjust T&E mechanism, fire and so on. 12.11.3.3.  During  qualification,  once  the  student  has  fired  at  the  required  number  of targets,  any  remaining  ammunition  is  returned  to  the  instructor  for  placement  back  into the ammunition inventory.  Ensure the AF Forms 522 and 710 reflect the correct number of rounds fired by the student. 12.11.3.4.  Qualification standards are contained in the course of fire. 12.11.4.  Course Notes. 12.11.4.1.  Instructors teach students as needed during the practice phase/orders.  During evaluation phases, instructors can help students between orders of fire, as needed, correct safety infractions and supervise how students apply immediate action procedures. 12.11.4.2.  Assistant  gunners  are  not  used  for  Phases  I,  II  or  V,  but  are  mandatory  for Phases III and IV.  On those phases where an assistant gunner is used, assistant gunners give all fire corrections to the gunners (with the exception of zero).  Ensure students are equipped with the appropriate tripod, T&E mechanism and spare barrel kit.  Gun crews wear issued ICE, including helmet, body armor, LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), Nomex  gloves,  gas  mask  carrier  (with  gas  mask  and  protective  gloves),  eye  protection and hearing protection during all firing orders. 12.11.4.3.  Sight  corrections  and  T&E  mechanism  adjustments  (Phases  III  and  IV)  may be made at any time throughout the course. 12.11.4.4.  All orders in Phases I, II, VI, and VII are fired in the bipod mode. 12.11.4.5.  Initial lay on all targets is midpoint.  After the initial burst, the gunner moves to  the closest part  of the target to  the gunner, then  moves  to  the farthest point from the gunner  and  finally  back  to  the  midpoint.    Instructors  ensure  targets  are  large  enough  to allow adequate traversing and/or searching with the required number of bursts.  Gunners should  ensure  beaten  zones  overlap  while  firing.    Gunners  do  not  fire  and  make  T&E mechanism  adjustments  at  the  same  time.    This  technique  is  used  for  training  and simulates no known threat.  In real-life situations, gunners tactically engage the portion of the target posing the greatest threat to themselves or the gun position. 12.11.4.6.  After  completing  Phase  I,  Order  4  and  Phase  II,  Order  2,  the  firing  point instructor will give the command “Gas, Gas, Gas” and the gun crew immediately puts the gun on Safe, dons the gas mask and gloves and then engages the next target. 12.11.4.7.  Phase  V  is  mandatory  for  personnel  completing  qualification  to  support UTC’s  requiring  vehicle  mounted  weapons  and  optional  for  in-garrison  requirements  to fill mission training needs for individual units.  (T-1).  For qualification to support UTC requirements,  Combat  Arms  requires  an  approved  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL  for  any portion  of  this  phase  that  they  cannot  complete  because  of  range  limitations  or  other limiting factors.  A waiver is not required for in-garrison requirements. 12.11.4.7.1.  If required, conduct Phase V vehicle firing using blank ammunition and the  Multiple  Integrated  Laser  Engagement  System  (MILES)  equipped  weapons  and targets.   220  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 12.11.4.7.1.1.  Use  one  area  target  at  300  meters,  with  at  least  four  double  "E" silhouettes or 55-gallon drums.  Hang MILES harnesses over the targets or drums.  Position  the  vehicle  parallel  to  the  firing  line  with  the  weapon  pointing  down range  (perpendicular  to  the  vehicle).    An  instructor  should  be  available  with  a MILES reset key and radio.  The instructor indicates target hits and resets MILES harnesses  for  each  gunner.   When  conducting  moving  vehicle  firing, the  vehicle should move parallel to the firing line at a speed of 3 to 5 mph. 12.11.4.7.1.2.  Units  that  cannot  conduct  moving  vehicle  training  due  to  range limitations  may  request  a  deviation  from  AFSFC/FGWL.    AFSFC/FGWL  may approve  a  deviation  to  Phase  V  for  Combat  Arms  to  implement  an  alternative method of providing practical experience to gunners on vehicle firing, such as use of virtual training systems or dry-fire practice of aiming at targets from a moving vehicle. 12.11.4.8.  Phase  VI  and  VII  are  mandatory  for  personnel  conducting  qualification  in support of UTC’s using STANO equipment and optional for in-garrison requirements to fill  mission  training  needs  for  individual  units.    (T-1).    Combat  Arms  requires  an approved  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL  for  any  portion  of  these  phases  that  they  cannot complete because of range limitations or other limiting factors. 12.11.4.9.  Should  gunners  fail  to  achieve  a  qualified  score  on  any  order,  they  are unqualified.  However, if re-fired within 30 days, gunners need only refire and qualify on those orders failed on the previous attempt.  After 30 days, gunners must refire the entire course.  (T-1). 12.11.4.10.  AF  Form  522  need  only  reflect  qualified  "Q"  or  unqualified  "UQ"  for  the entire course.  However, instructors annotate (in the remarks block of the AF Form 522) any order the student fails and does not requalify during the class to ensure only the failed order is re-fired IAW paragraph 12.11.4.9. above.  A numerical score is not  required in the score block of AF Forms 522 or 710. 12.11.4.11.  Instructors  enter  the  models  of  small  arms  STANO  equipment  (e.g., AN/PEQ-15, AN/PAS-13 V2) the individual qualified with in the remarks section of the AF Form 522. 12.11.4.12.  Enter the phase(s) of the course not completed by the individual and cite the waiver/deviation authorization source in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Note: Some  deviations  (e.g.,  gas  mask  or  night  fire  phases)  may  not  meet  the  CCMD requirements.    Installations/units  deploying  personnel  with  a  waiver/deviation  to  any portions  of  the  course,  including  night  fire  phases,  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  approved waiver to the CCMD OPR and ensure the AF 522 is properly documented as directed by AFI 36-2654.  (T-1). AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   221  Chapter 13 MK-19 MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM 13.1.  MK-19  Machine  Gun  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the minimum  training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship skills and performance evaluations required for qualification with the MK-19.  Assistant machine gunners  complete  the  same  training  program  and  meet  the  same  qualification  standards  as primary machine gunners. 13.2.  Training Overview. 13.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student's  first  participation  in  the  MK-19  Qualification Training  Program.    Initial  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  passing  all  training objectives in Table 13.1, and qualifying on the MK-19 Machine Gun AFQC.  The AF Form 522 entered in SFMIS reflects a 12-month qualification. 13.2.2.  Recurring  Training  (12-Month).   This  is  qualification  training  after  initial qualification.    This  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  MK-19 Machine  Gun  AFQC  and  passing  mechanical  evaluations.    The  required  frequencies  for recurring training and qualification are outlined in AFI 36-2654.  Weapons safety procedures and  the  training  objectives  in  Table  13.1  are  the  minimum  mandatory  items  required  for recurring training.  The AF Form 522 (SFMIS) reflects a 12-month qualification. 13.2.3.  Mechanical  Recurring  Training  (6-Month).    This  is  weapon  operator  skill  re-certification  training.    This  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction  and  passing  all  the performance  evaluations.    Students  are  given  the  performance  tests  and  those  who  fail  the performance tests are given remedial instruction and re-evaluated.  Refer to AFI 36-2654 for MK-19 mechanical training frequencies. 13.2.4.  Remedial  Training.    This  is  in-depth  training  needed  to  correct  marksmanship  or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to personnel who failed an evaluation.  Same day refires or on-the-spot corrections are not remedial training. 13.2.5.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Combat Arms completes evaluations for initial, 12-month recurring and 6-month mechanical recurring training. 13.2.6.  Unit  Training.    To  help  maintain  the  gunner’s  proficiency,  units  should  provide refresher  training  on  operator  skills  and  knowledge.    Units  should  conduct  this  training before exercises and deployments. 13.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 13.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons.   222  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 13.3.2.  Range.  Instructors supervise and coach/teach students as needed during pre-fire set-up,  zeroing,  practice  and  between  evaluation  orders  of  fire.    Each  firing  point  instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe range operations, close communication is essential between the range safety instructor, tower operator and all firing point instructors.  See AFI 36-2654 for instructor requirements and student to instructor ratios. 13.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 13.4.  MK-19  Qualification  Plan  of  Instruction.  The  plan  in  the  following  paragraphs  is intended  to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for  initial  and recurring  training.    Students  must  meet  and  be  evaluated  to  the  performance  standards  of  the training  objectives  listed  in  Table  13.1    (T-1).    Note:    Training  times  may  vary  depending  on class  size,  student  experience  level,  range  location,  etc.    Approximate  training  times  for  this program are: 13.4.1.  Initial training – 30 hours. 13.4.2.  Recurring training (12 months) – 22 hours. 13.4.3.  Mechanical Recurring training (6 months) – as needed for the student to successfully complete the required performance tests. 13.4.4.  Remedial training – as needed. 13.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain the capability to use the MK-19 against enemy targets and maintain the weapon to the level  authorized  for  the  operator.    The  students’  performance  is  evaluated  on  all  tasks  without assistance. 13.6.  Training  Objectives.  The  training  objectives  required  for  successful  completion  of  this program are listed in Table 13.1 13.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 13.6.1.1.  Roles of the MK-19.  (T-1). 13.6.1.2.  Safety rules and procedures.  (T-1). 13.6.1.3.  Characteristics, nomenclature and general data.

DESCRIPTION Vehicle Convoy           13.9.  Course Information, MK-19 AFQC. 13.9.1.  Targets for the Course: ROUNDS 9 (3 to 5-rd bursts)  DISTANCE M/YDS 1500 TIME (MIN) (see below) 5:00 Total for All Phase VIII Strings of Fire TARGET #4 27 Total Rounds  237 Total Rounds for Course          13.9.1.1.  Zero  Target.    Use  a  3-meter  by  3-meter  reinforced  panel  or  target  of comparable size, preferably of metal construction.  Example:  refuse dumpster, 55-gallon drums, armor plating, etc. 13.9.1.2.  Target #1, Single Vehicle.  Use a medium-size vehicle, approximately 8 meters by 3 meters.  Other material such as 55-gallon drums, large vehicle tires or aircraft tires, etc., may be used to simulate a single-vehicle size target. 13.9.1.3.  Target #2, Single Vehicle with Personnel.  Use one vehicle-size target, 8 meters by  3  meters  and  several  (7  to  10)  personnel  size  targets.    Personnel  targets  are approximately 2 meters high by 1 meter wide.  Place personnel targets around the vehicle on the firing line side to define a 30-meter target area. 13.9.1.4.  Target  #3,  Line  of  Troops.    Use  several  (15  to  20)  personnel  size  targets  (2 meters by 1 meter).  The size of the "Line of Troops" target area is 60 meters by 5 meters.  Place targets in linear or semicircle configuration. 13.9.1.5.  Target #4, Vehicle Convoy.  Use at least three large vehicle-size targets.  The length of the "convoy" target area is 90 meters. 13.9.1.6.  Moving Vehicle Phase Targets.  This is a shoot on the move phase.  A moving vehicle  range  may  be  superimposed  on  an  existing  range.    If  a  separate  area  is  used, construct targets according to the description of target 2 through target 5.  Two targets are used at distances varying from 500 meters to 800 meters.  Plainly mark the driving course where  firing  is  permitted.    For  example,  place  traffic  cones  along  the  portion  of  the course  where  firing  is  permitted.    The  gunner  only  fires  upon  the  command  of  the instructor.    The  driver,  assistant  gunner  (instructor)  and  the  gunner  are  encouraged  to work  as  a  mobile  fire  team  to  identify  targets,  determine  range  and  identify  kills  or misses.    Do  not  exceed  10  mph  if  the  driving  course  is  an  improved  and  maintained driving  surface.    Do  not  exceed  5  mph  if  driving  course  is  an  unimproved  and  rough driving  surface.    Note:    Present  range  design  and  target  configuration  may  vary  from those described for this phase. 13.9.2.  Course Standards.   232  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 13.9.2.1.  Phases II, IV and VII (Phase VII does not include Target #2).  All four targets are effectively engaged within 8 minutes.  This time includes reloading.  All four (three for Phase VII) targets have at least two hits each. 13.9.2.1.1.  Target #1.  Minimum two hits within the 5-meter kill radius. 13.9.2.1.2.  Target #2.  Minimum two hits within the 5-meter kill radius. 13.9.2.1.3.  Target #3.  Minimum two hits within the 15-meter casualty radius. 13.9.2.1.4.  Target #4.  Minimum two hits within the 15-meter casualty radius. 13.9.2.2.  Phases III, V and VIII.  A minimum of one hit per target within the 5-meter kill radius on vehicles and 15-meter casualty radius on personnel within 5 minutes.  All four targets have at least one hit each (Phases VII and VIII only includes three targets). 13.9.2.3.  Orientation Phase VI.  Gunners achieve a minimum of one hit per target within the 15-meter casualty radius.  Both targets have at least one hit each. 13.9.3.  Course Notes. 13.9.3.1.  Units  that  cannot  conduct  moving  vehicle  training  due  to  range  limitations request  a  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL.    AFSFC/FGWL  may  approve  a  waiver  to  Phase IV; however, Combat Arms must implement an alternative method of providing practical experience  to  gunners  on  this  firing  method,  such  as  use  of  virtual  training  systems  or dry-fire practice of aiming at targets from a moving vehicle.  (T-1). 13.9.3.2.  Gunners  qualify  on  Phase  III,  V  and  VIII.    If  the  gunners  fail  to  meet  the minimum standards, they are unqualified with the weapon.  Instructors may immediately refire an individual on any phases a gunner failed; however, if the gunner fails to qualify after  remedial  training,  the  gunner  is  unqualified  and  repeats  the  entire  course  to  meet qualification training requirements. 13.9.3.3.  Instructors will not teach or coach during actual firing of the evaluation phase; however,  the  gun  crew  should  be  encouraged  to  work  as  a  team  for  maximum effectiveness  during  firing  and  instructors  can  provide  assistance  between  orders  of fire as  needed.    Instructors  correct  safety  infractions  and  supervise  the  application  of immediate action procedures by the gun crew if they experience stoppages. 13.9.3.4.  Gunners fire the entire course using training practice ammunition. 13.9.3.5.  Instructors  ensure  the  suppression  stop  on  the  cradle  mount  is  adjusted  to prevent rounds from impacting closer than 310 meters from the weapon. 13.9.3.6.  Students  wear  issued  ICE,  including  helmet,  body  armor,  LBE/LBV, knee/elbow pads (if issued), and gas mask carrier, with gas mask and protective gloves, while firing. 13.9.3.7.  Eye and hearing protection is used by all personnel on the range. 13.9.3.8.  Ammunition belts should be divided up to match the required rounds for each order  of  fire.    Instructors  ensure  SFMIS  entries  for  AF  Forms  522  and  710  reflect  the correct number of rounds fired by the student. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   233  13.9.3.9.  Instructors enter the models of small arms STANO equipment (e.g., AN/PAS-13 V3) the individual qualified with in the remarks section of the AF Form 522. 13.9.3.10.  Enter the phase(s) of the course not completed by the individual and cite the waiver/deviation authorization source in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Note: Some  deviations  (e.g.,  gas  mask  or  night  fire  phases)  may  not  meet  the  CCMD requirements.    Installations/units  deploying  personnel  with  a  waiver/deviation  to  any portions  of  the  course,  including  night  fire  phases,  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  approved waiver to the CCMD OPR and ensure the AF 522 is properly documented as directed by AFI 36-2654.  (T-1).   234  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 Chapter 14 M2 (M2A1) MACHINE GUN TRAINING PROGRAM 14.1.  M2  or  M2A1  Machine  Gun  AFQC.  The  AFQC  provides  Air  Force  members  with  the minimum  training;  weapon  safety,  mechanical,  operator  maintenance,  handling,  marksmanship skills  and  performance  evaluations  required  for  qualification  with  the  M2  or  M2A1.    Assistant machine gunners complete the same training program and meet the same qualification standards as  primary  machine  gunners.    Note:    Throughout  this  chapter,  all  references  to  the  M2  also include the M2A1, unless otherwise specified. 14.2.  Training Overview. 14.2.1.  Initial Training.  This is the student's first participation in the M2 Training Program.  Initial training consists of classroom instruction, passing all training objectives in Table 14.1 and qualifying  on the M2 Machine Gun AFQC.  The AF Form 522 (SFMIS) reflects a 12-month qualification. 14.2.2.  Recurring  Training  (12-Months).    This  is  qualification  training  after  initial qualification.    This  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction,  qualification  on  the  M2 Machine  Gun  AFQC  and  passing  mechanical  evaluations.    The  required  frequencies  for recurring training and qualification are outlined in AFI 36-2654.  Weapons safety procedures and  the  training  objectives  in  Table  14.1  are  the  minimum  mandatory  items  required  for recurring training.  The AF Form 522 (SFMIS) reflects a 12-month qualification. 14.2.3.  Mechanical  Recurring  Training  (6-Months).    This  is  weapon  operator  skill  re-certification  training.    This  training  consists  of  classroom  instruction  and  passing  all  the performance  evaluations.    Students  are  given  the  performance  tests  and  those  who  fail  the performance tests are given remedial instruction and re-evaluated.  Refer to AFI 36-2654 for M2 mechanical training frequencies. 14.2.4.  Remedial  Training.    This  is  in-depth  training  needed  to  correct  marksmanship  or other skill deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to personnel who failed an evaluation.  Same day refires or on-the-spot corrections are not remedial training. 14.2.5.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations, located in lesson plans, consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Combat Arms completes evaluations for initial, 12-month and 6-month recurring training. 14.2.6.  Unit  Training.    To  help  maintain  gun  crew  proficiency,  units  should  provide refresher  training  on  operator  skills  and  knowledge.    Units  should  conduct  this  training before exercises and deployments. 14.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 14.3.1.  Classroom.    Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons  training.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  student  to  instructor  ratios  and  exceptions.  Instructors  should  associate  the  various  skills  taught  during  training  to  real  life  scenarios.  This  ensures  students  understand  the  tactics,  techniques,  and  procedures  used  to  effectively utilize their weapons. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   235  14.3.2.  Range.  Instructors supervise and coach/teach students as needed during pre-fire set-up,  zeroing,  practice  and  between  evaluation  orders  of  fire.    Each  firing  point  instructor conducts the course of fire, to include monitoring time limits, at the firing point.  To ensure safe  range  operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the  range  safety  instructor and  all  point  instructors.    See  AFI  36-2654  for  instructor  requirements  and  student  to instructor ratios. 14.3.3.  Tower Operator.  This individual must be a certified Combat Arms instructor (AFSC 3P0X1B/SEI 312/DoD civilian equivalent) as outlined in AFI 36-2654.  The tower operator has responsibility and authority for safe and effective range operations during range training sessions.  He/she may work directly on the firing line if a fixed control tower is not on the range.  Note:  This position is in addition to each firing point instructor.  The tower operator may not serve as a firing point instructor.  See AFI 36-2654 for exceptions. 14.4.  M2 Qualification Plan of Instruction.  The plan in the following paragraphs is intended to  provide  instruction  standardization.    This  program  is  mandatory  for  initial  and  recurring training.    Students  must  meet  and  be  evaluated  to  the  performance  standards  of  the  training objectives listed in Table 14.1  (T-1).  Note:  Training times will vary depending on class size, student experience level, range location, etc.  Approximate training times for this program are: 14.4.1.  Initial training – 40 hours. 14.4.2.  Recurring training (12-month) – 32 hours. 14.4.3.  Mechanical Recurring training (6-month) – as needed for the student to successfully complete the required performance tests. 14.4.4.  Remedial training – as needed. 14.5.  Training  Goal.  The  training  goal  is  to  instill  confidence  in  the  student  to  develop  and maintain  the  capability  to  successfully  use  the  M2  against  enemy  targets  and  maintain  the weapon  to  the  level  authorized  for  the  operator.    Combat  Arms  evaluates  the  students’ performance on all tasks; students complete tasks without assistance. 14.6.  Training  Objectives.  The  training  objectives  required  for  successful  completion  of  this program are listed in Table 14.1 14.6.1.  Intermediate Training Objectives.  Students must understand, demonstrate and apply: 14.6.1.1.  Safety rules and procedures.  (T-1). 14.6.1.2.  Characteristics, nomenclature and types of ammunition.  (T-1). 14.6.1.3.

Double  "E"  silhouette  targets,  empty  55-gallon  drums,  salvaged  vehicles  or mounds of earth can be used to represent personnel and vehicle targets. 14.9.1.2.  Point targets should consist of three separate vehicle type targets. 14.9.1.3.  Deep targets should consist of a minimum of five targets. 14.9.1.4.  Linear with depth targets should consist of at least eight double "E" silhouette targets or paired 55-gallon drums. 14.9.1.5.  Area  targets  should  consist  of  at  least  five  double  "E"  silhouette  targets  or paired 55-gallon drums and arranged to form a group. 14.9.1.6.  Phase  V  Moving  Vehicle  Targets:    This  is  a  shoot  on  the  move  phase.    A moving  vehicle  range  may  be  superimposed  on  an  existing  range.    If  a  separate  area  is used, construct targets according to the description of area targets in paragraph 14.9.1.5.  Three targets are required at distances varying from 500 meters to 1,000 meters.  Plainly mark the driving course where firing is permitted.  For example, place traffic cones along the  portion  of  the  course  where  firing  is  permitted.    The  gunner  only  fires  upon  the   244  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 command of  the instructor.   The driver,  assistant  gunner (instructor) and the gunner  are encouraged to work as a mobile fire team to identify targets, determine range and identify kills  or  misses.    Do  not  exceed  10  mph  if  the  driving  course  is  an  improved  and maintained driving surface.  Do not exceed 5 mph if the driving course is an unimproved and rough driving course.  Note:  Present range design and target configuration may vary from those described for this phase. 14.9.1.7.  On  Phases  VIII  and  IX,  designate  four  targets  for  gunners  to  identify  on  the range cards. 14.9.1.8.  On  Phase  IX,  conduct  fire  missions  in  random  order  of  the  targets  designated on the range cards. 14.9.2.  Course Standards. 14.9.2.1.  On Phase II, Order 1, if the beaten zone covers the target area, it is considered a hit.  The gunner must hit three targets.  (T-1). 14.9.2.2.  On Phase II, Order 2, if the beaten zone covers the target area, it is considered a hit.  The gunner must hit 13 targets.  (T-1).  Initial lay on all targets is midpoint.  After the  initial  burst,  the  gunner  moves  to  the  closest  part  of  the  target  to  the  gunner,  then moves to the farthest point from the gunner and finally back to the midpoint.  Instructors ensure  targets  are  large  enough  to  allow  adequate  traversing  and/or  searching  with  the required  number  of  bursts.    Gunners  should  ensure  beaten  zones  overlap  while  firing.  Gunners  do  not  fire  and  make  T&E  mechanism  adjustments  at  the  same  time.    This technique  is  used  for  training  and  simulates  no  known  threat.    In  real-life  situations, gunners  will  tactically  engage  the  portion  of  the  target  posing  the  greatest  threat  to themselves or the gun position. 14.9.2.3.  On Phase IV, Order 1, if the beaten zone covers the target area, it is considered a hit.  The gunner must have at least three bursts on the target from a stationary position.  (T-1). 14.9.2.4.  On Phase IV, Order 2, if the beaten zone covers the target area, it is considered a hit.  The gunner must hit three targets.  (T-1). 14.9.2.5.  On  Phase  VII,  if  the  beaten  zone  covers the target  area, it is  considered a  hit.  The gunner must hit three targets.  (T-1). 14.9.2.6.  On  Phase  IX,  if  the  beaten  zone  covers  the  target  area,  it  is  considered  a  hit.  The gunner must hit four targets.  (T-1). 14.9.3.  Course Notes. 14.9.3.1.  Units  that  cannot  conduct  moving  vehicle  training  due  to  range  limitations request  a  waiver  from  AFSFC/FGWL.    AFSFC/FGWL  may  approve  a  waiver  to  Phase V; however, Combat Arms must implement an alternative method of providing practical experience  to  gunners  on  this  firing  method,  such  as  use  of  virtual  training  systems  or dry-fire practice of aiming at targets from a moving vehicle.  (T-1). 14.9.3.2.  There  are  no  time  limits  during  practice  phases.    Instructors  observe  setting headspace  and  timing,  render  help  needed,  observe  rounds  impacting  in  target  areas, correct safety infractions and supervise students who perform immediate action. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   245  14.9.3.3.  Assistant  gunners  are  used  for  all  tripod  orders  of  fire.    Instructors  should emphasize  the  importance  of  teamwork.    Except  for  zeroing,  the  assistant  gunner  gives fire  corrections  to  the  gunner.    Gun  crews  wear  helmets,  individual  body  armor  and hearing protection during all firing orders.  Both the gunner and assistant gunner have gas masks and gloves on their person during the entire course.  Gunners perform all vehicle firing without an assistant gunner. 14.9.3.4.  Whenever  possible,  gun  crews  should  fire  4:1  ball  and  tracer  mix.    All  firing should be five to  seven round  bursts.  During qualification, once  the student  has hit the required  number  of  targets,  they  return  any  remaining  ammunition  to  the  instructor  for placement back into the ammunition inventory.  Ensure the AF Form 522 and AF Form 710 reflect the correct number of rounds fired by the student. 14.9.3.5.  Sight  corrections  and  T&E  mechanism  adjustments  may  be  made  at  any  time throughout the course. 14.9.3.6.  All phases are fired on a full-distance range. 14.9.3.7.  On  orders  requiring  CWDE,  the  gun  crews  don  their  gas  masks  and  gloves before starting the firing orders. 14.9.3.8.  Linear and deep targets are engaged as a single gun covering the entire target. 14.9.3.9.  On Phases III, IV, VI and VII, instructors may position the vehicle parallel with or at a right angle to the firing line with the weapon pointed down range. 14.9.3.10.  On  Phases  VI  and  VII,  gunners  use  night  vision  devices  and  night  aiming devices  on  the  machinegun.    Instructors  may  add  artificial  illumination,  as  they  deem necessary. 14.9.3.11.  Use  Phase  VIII  and  Phase  IX  to  train  and  evaluate  the  gun  crews'  ability  to prepare  range  cards  and  engage  targets  using  range  cards.    On  Phase  VIII,  they  a  100-round belt during daylight hours to obtain direction and elevation readings for the targets indicated.  They have 15 minutes to prepare field expedient range cards using bandoleer boxes,  wooden  spacers  from  ammunition  crates,  etc.,  and  complete  the  phase.    During phase IX, gun crews fire four fire missions using range cards prepared during phase VIII.  Night vision devices, illumination rounds or flares may be used with night fire training. 14.9.3.12.  In the event night fire cannot be accomplished, conduct Phases VI, VII and IX during the day using daylight filters on aiming devices and night vision. 14.9.3.13.  Do  not  reconstruct  firing  ranges  for  the  sole  purpose  of  complying  with  this course of fire. 14.9.3.14.  If a gunner fails to meet the minimum standards, they are unqualified with the weapon.  Instructors may immediately refire an individual on any phases failed; however, if the gunner  fails to qualify after  remedial training,  the gunner is unqualified.  Combat Arms may conduct remedial training and refire the gunner on only the phases they failed, if they accomplish this within 30 days of the original failure.  Beyond 30 days, the gunner re-accomplishes all performance evaluations and refires the entire course.   246  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 14.9.3.15.  When Combat Arms enters the scores in SFMIS, they are not required to enter a  numerical  score.    AF  Form  522  and  AF  Form  710  only  reflect  qualified  "Q"  or unqualified "UQ" for the course. 14.9.3.16.  Instructors enter the models of small arms STANO equipment (e.g., AN/PAS-13 V3) the individual trained with in the remarks section of the AF Form 522. 14.9.3.17.  Enter the phase(s) of the course not completed by the individual and cite the waiver/deviation authorization source in the remarks section of the AF Form 522.  Note: Some  deviations  (e.g.,  gas  mask  or  night  fire  phases)  may  not  meet  the  CCMD requirements.    Installations/units  deploying  personnel  with  a  waiver/deviation  to  any portions  of  the  course,  including  night  fire  phases,  will  provide  a  copy  of  the  approved waiver to the CCMD OPR and ensure the AF 522 is properly documented as directed by AFI 36-2654.  (T-1). AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   247  Chapter 15 COMMON REMOTELY OPERATED WEAPON STATION II (CROWS II) TRAINING PROGRAM 15.1.  XM153 CROWS II AFQC.  The CROWS II AFQC provides Air Force members with the minimum training, tactics, techniques, procedures and performance evaluations for qualification with  the  CROWS  platform  as  an  operator.    The  CROWS  II  AFQC  is  an  advanced/specialized training program for initial and recurring training.  This training program requires live-fire with the  CROWS  II.    In  addition,  operators  must  be  qualified  on  the  AFQC  (or  applicable qualification course) for the weapon(s) they will employ with the CROWS II, as outlined in AFI 36-2654.    Qualification  on  the  CROWS  II  is  accomplished  by  successful  completion  of  the performance evaluations included in this training program. 15.2.  Training Overview. 15.2.1.  Initial  Training.    This  is  the  student’s  first  participation  in  the  training  program.  Initial  training  consists  of  in-depth  classroom  instruction,  performance  evaluations  and simulator training. 15.2.2.  Recurring  Training  (12-Month).   This  is  qualification  training  after  initial qualification.  It consists of classroom instruction, passing the performance evaluations and simulator training.  Evaluation is completed on an annual basis.  The AF Form 522 reflects a 12-month  qualification.    Note:    Individuals  may  bypass  classroom  instruction  if  they successfully complete all performance evaluations, without assistance and simulator training.  This option is only valid for individuals who have successfully completed initial training. 15.2.3.  Remedial  Training.    This  is  the  minimum  training  needed  to  correct  deficiencies causing an individual to fail an evaluation.  This is scheduled training given to personnel who failed an evaluation.  Same day refires or on-the-spot corrections are not remedial training. 15.2.4.  Performance Evaluations.  Performance evaluations consist of weapon operator skills certification.  Instructors accomplish evaluations for initial and recurring training. 15.2.5.  Instructor  Training.    Initial  instructor  training  is  conducted  through  the  US  Army Tank-Automotive  and  Armaments  Command  (TACOM)  or  through  TACOM  certified trainers.  Instructor training consists of completion of initial CROWS II training, on-the-job training and an instructor evaluation.  Instructors for this program may be from any 3P0X1X Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (AFSC)  as  long  as  they  meet  the  instructor  evaluation  and certification requirements for this course as outlined in AFI 36-2654; they are not required to be Combat Arms.  CROWS II instructors must  complete an annual instructor evaluation on this  course  to  maintain  lead  instructor  certification.    (T-1).    For  Combat  Arms  instructors, this evaluation is in addition to the annual no notice evaluation required in AFI 36-2654 on a different weapon and course.  Organizations may conduct recurring instructor training at unit level utilizing performance evaluations, simulator exercises and an instructor evaluation. 15.3.  Instructor Guidelines. 15.3.1.  Classroom  Instructors  supervise,  assist  and  evaluate  students  during  all  hands  on weapons training.  Instructors should associate the various skills taught during training to real life scenarios.  This ensures students understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures used   248  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 to  effectively  utilize  their  weapons.    Instructor  to  student  ratio  is  one  instructor  per  seven students. 15.3.2.  Live-fire  Requirements.    Live-fire  orientation  is  required  for  qualification.    (T-1).  Operators  are  provided  the  opportunity  to  conduct  live-fire  orientation  with  each  weapon they  employ  from  the  CROWS  II.    Although  there  is  no  minimum  score  required,  the expectation is for the gunner to accurately engage each target/silhouette.  All live-fire range operations must be conducted in accordance with the guidance contained in AFI 36-2654. 15.3.2.1.  Range.    Instructors  supervise  and  coach/teach  students  as  needed  during grouping,  zeroing,  practice  and  between  evaluation  orders  of  fire.    Each  firing  point instructor  conducts  the  course  of  fire,  to  include  monitoring  time  limits,  at  the  firing point.    To  ensure  safe  range  operations,  close  communication  is  essential  between  the range  safety  instructor,  tower  operator  and  all  firing  point  instructors.    Instructor  to student ratio is one instructor per weapon/CROWS II. 15.3.2.2.  Tower  Operator.

Security  Forces  SMC  Course.  The  SMC  course  is  used  to  meet  the  annual  mandatory sustainment  training  requirements  for  Security  Forces  (SF)  personnel  as  directed  by  AFI  36-2654.  SF personnel, who do not complete this training prior to the first day of the eighth month after  qualification,  cannot  be  armed  with  the  rifle/carbine  until  they  satisfactorily  complete  the SMC Course or AFQC as directed by AFI 36-2654.  This course is not a qualification course and except  as  noted  in  this  chapter,  Combat  Arms  does  not  conduct  the  training  outlined  in  this course.    Unit  personnel  conduct  this  course  using  Close  Combat  Mission  Capability  Kits (CCMCK)  and  dye-marking  rounds  only.    Live  ammunition,  other  than  blanks  or  dye-marking rounds, are not authorized to be used in this course of fire.  The SMC Course is mandatory for Security Forces personnel; however, other organizations may conduct training using this course and following the guidance in this chapter.  (T-1). 16.2.  Training Goal.  The training goal is to develop Airmen to shoot, move and communicate effectively  and  for  each  Security  Forces  member  to  become  proficient  at  applying  these  skills.  These skills allow personnel to engage enemy threats while acting as a team.  To accomplish the goal,  instructors  ensure  Airmen  demonstrate  safe  weapon  handling,  proper  communication  and movement skills while engaging targets (threats) using dye-marking cartridges. 16.3.  Training  Plan.  The  training  for  this  course  is  broken  down  into  several  phases,  which follow the “Crawl, Walk, Run” methodology.  Each successive phase builds upon the previous phase by requiring Airmen to apply skills previously learned.  Due to the inherent risk involved in  this  type  training,  students  must  pass  all  training  objectives  and  performance  evaluations before they are allowed to  progress to  the next phase of training.   (T-1).  Students who do not pass  training  objectives  are  not  allowed  to  progress  to  the  next  phase  until  they  have  received remedial  training  and  met  performance  objectives.    Performance  objectives  are  rated  either  a “GO” or “NO-GO.”  Students who receive a “GO” on all objectives in an order progress to the next training phase.  Note:  This training is not intended to be accomplished only once per year, but  implemented  as  an  ongoing  training  program  within  Security  Forces  units.    Unit  personnel train  individuals  on  portions  of  the  program  and  separate  skills  continually  and  students  are evaluated at the individual and team levels. 16.3.1.  Instructor  Certification.    Combat  Arms  conducts  initial  certification  of  Security Forces  training  personnel,  flight  leadership  (NCO’s),  and  standardization  and  evaluation personnel  (trainers  and  evaluators).   This  training  encompasses  safety  procedures, installation/use  of  dye-marking  adapters/  cartridges  (as  outlined  in  HQ  USAF/A4SX  Close Combat Mission Capability Kit (CCMCK) Training CONOPS, TO 11W2-9-4-11, Technical Manual  Operator’s  Manual  for  Close  Combat  Mission  Capability  Kit  (CCMCK)  and  local guidance),  proper  weapons  handling,  communication,  movement  techniques,  use  of  cover and range safety officer procedures/responsibilities as outlined in AFI 36-2654. 16.3.1.1.  Document  initial  instructor  certification  training  on  AF  Form  797  in  the  Air Force Training Record (AFTR) using the example at Figures 16.1. through Figure 16.3.  AFSFC/FGWL and units may add tasks but may not remove any. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   255  16.3.1.2.  Certify  instructors  every  12  months  and  re-accomplish  training  as  necessary.  Document  annual  certification  on  AF  Form  1098,  Special  Task  Certification  and Recurring Training, utilizing AFTR and following the AF Form 1098 example at Figure 16.5.  AFSFC/FGWL and units may add tasks but may not remove any. 16.3.2.  Training  Requirements.    Prior  to  undergoing  this  training,  all  Security  Forces personnel must be currently qualified on the M4 carbine.  (T-1).  Security Forces personnel who are not armed with the handgun may complete handgun transition orders using dry-fire.  Do not qualify Security Forces personnel on the handgun solely to complete the SMC.  Note:  The requirement for Security Forces personnel to be currently qualified is intended to enforce the  qualification/sustainment  training  cycle.    Non-Security  Forces  personnel  may  complete this  training  (or  similar  training)  following  the  guidance  in  the  HQ  USAF/A4SX  Close Combat  Mission  Capability  Kit  (CCMCK)  Training  CONOPS  and  TO  11W2-9-4-11.    The following is the training sequence for the SMC sustainment course: 16.3.2.1.  Unit personnel complete all phases during initial training. initial training, 16.3.2.2.  Following leadership  conduct  monthly sustainment training to allow personnel to maintain skills.  Incorporating this sustainment training  into  existing  training  days  may  be  the  best  option  and  need  not  always  include the use of dye-marking cartridges. flight/section 16.3.2.3.  The  Security  Forces  Standardization  and  Evaluation  section  incorporates evaluation of these skills into Force-on-Force evaluations.  They develop checklists using the objectives contained in Table 16.1 16.3.2.4.  Document  initial  training/certification  on  AF  Form  797  in  AFTR  using  the examples at Figures 16.3. through Figure 16.4.  AFSFC/FGWL and units may add tasks but may not remove any. 16.3.2.5.  Document  annual  training/certification  on  AF  Form  1098  in  AFTR  using  the example  at  Figure  16.5.    AFSFC/FGWL  and  units  may  add  tasks  but  may  not  remove any. 16.3.3.  Advanced  Training  Techniques  and  Procedures.    For  initial  training  on  this  course and  included  skills,  individuals  complete  training  and  the  course  of  fire  as  written  and without  modification.    Once  an  individual  has  successfully  completed  training  for  the  first 12-month  cycle  (qualified  on  current  Security  Forces  qualification  course,  completed  all SMC  skills  training,  SMC  course  of  fire  and  evaluation),  units  add  more  challenging modifications  to  the  course  of  fire.    This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  replacing  paper targets  with  opposing  force  personnel  firing  dye-marking  cartridges  at  shooters,  adding smoke, ground burst simulators or other simulated battlefield conditions.  Using safe methods to increase stress or simulate battlefield confusion enhances training and encourages proper application of skills in high stress environments. 16.4.  Training Objectives. 16.4.1.  Students must be able to perform all objectives required in Table  16.1  (T-1).  The objectives  are  listed  in  order  according  to  the  lesson  plan  and  events  that  take  place throughout the training day.   256  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 16.4.2.  Students must be able to perform all objectives required in Table 16.2  (T-1).  This table contains the course of fire to be completed by all personnel.  Individuals who complete this  course  of  fire  5-7  months  after  live-fire  qualification  meet  the  sustainment  firing requirement. Table 16.1.

Security Forces SMC Course Notes. 16.6.1.  Introduction.  The purpose of this course of fire is to train Security Forces Airmen to shoot,  move  and  communicate  in  combat.    This  course  uses  the  “Crawl,  Walk,  Run” methodology  where  students  master  each  level  of  training  prior  to  advancing  to  the  next level.  Individuals must be currently qualified on the M4 (or other rifle/carbine) before being allowed  to  participate  in  this  training.    (T-1).    Range  personnel  (range  safety  officers)  are individuals who have been trained and certified as required in AFI 36-2654.  The object is for shooters to learn basic individual techniques, and then advance to two-member, fire team and finally squad level application of combat tactics. 16.6.2.  General  guidance.    Instructors  conduct  all  orders  of  fire  as  dry-fire  training  with performance  evaluations  prior  to  live-fire  training.    Range  safety  officers  first  demonstrate the technique, students practice and then performance evaluations are administered.  Ensure students pass the performance evaluation (a minimum of ten repetitions) prior to advancing to the next level of training. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   263  16.6.2.1.  Throughout  this  training,  safety  is  paramount  and  is  the  primary  concern  of range  safety  personnel.    This  course  of  fire  involves  moving  with  weapons  laterally  as well as forward and rearward.  It also involves team members moving forward of and to the  rear  of  other  team  members  who  are  firing  at  targets.    Therefore,  anyone  who commits any of the following safety infractions is immediately removed from the range: 16.6.2.1.1.  Points a weapon at themselves or others – Muzzle discipline! 16.6.2.1.2.  Does not place the selector on Safe prior to moving.  Weapons remain on Safe at all times until sights are on target and the shooter is ready to fire. 16.6.2.1.3.  Places  the  finger  inside  the  trigger  guard  when  not  engaging  targets  – Trigger finger discipline! 16.6.2.1.4.  Points the muzzle in any direction or at any angle deemed unsafe by range safety personnel. 16.6.2.2.  The training progression is as follows: 16.6.2.2.1.  Dry-fire practice 16.6.2.2.2.  Dry-fire performance evaluation (successfully complete 10 repetitions) 16.6.2.2.3.  Live-fire  with  dye-marking  cartridges.    Note:    These  steps  are  followed for every individual order of fire. 16.6.3.  Commands.  The following commands/replies are used for communication: 16.6.3.1.  “MOVE  LEFT,  RIGHT,  UP,  BACK”  –  Team  leader  issues  this  command telling  members  the  direction  of  movement.    This  command  is  not  issued  until  the covering  team  is  “READY”  to  provide  suppressive  fire.    If  the  covering  team  is  not ready, this command is not given! 16.6.3.2.  “COVER” – A request to cover a sector.  Given when a member ceases firing to reload, clear a stoppage, or move to another position.  It simply means they will not be firing. 16.6.3.3.  “READY”  –  Alerts  member who requested “COVER” that  suppressive fire is ready. 16.6.3.4.  “MOVING  LEFT,  RIGHT,  UP,  BACK”  –  Reply  to  “READY.”    Informs covering team members you are moving. 16.6.4.  Targets for course:  Use the Military "E" target facer (NSN 6920-00-600-6874) and Military  "E" target backer (NSN 6920-00-795-1806)  or  suitable substitute.  At a minimum, targets have a 10-inch chalk circle drawn in the vital area (thoracic cavity) and a 6-inch chalk circle  drawn  in  the  head,  following  the  guidance  for  handgun  AFQC  targets  outlined  in Chapter 2.  The preferred method is to place a shirt over the target.  This benefits the student by providing visual feedback and is more realistic because it forces the student to determine where the vital zone is based on target outline rather than using the traditional circle outline.  After  students  have  initially  and  successfully  completed  the  course,  units  may  substitute opposing force personnel for paper targets. 16.6.5.  Barricades:  Down range barricades are needed to simulate cover for shooters and to complete  this  course  of  fire.    Barricades  can  be  built  or  improvised  from  target  frames  or   264  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 other  devices  and  are  constructed  of  non-ricochet  producing  material  (plywood,  cloth,  soft plastic or  plastic barrels).   Do not  place  barricades constructed of  materials that  produce or could produce ricochets forward of shooters. 16.6.6.  Instructor  ratios.    The  following  instructor/student  ratios  will  be  maintained  during all orders requiring movement:  (T-1). 16.6.6.1.  Non-standard  response  (Order  1)  and  transition  to  handgun  (Order  2)  –  One instructor per 7 students. 16.6.6.2.  Individual movement – One instructor per student. 16.6.6.3.  Two-Member movement – One instructor per two-member team 16.6.6.4.  Fire  team  movement  –  One  instructor  per  two-member  team  (two  instructors per fire team) and one CRO to observe everyone. 16.6.7.  Table I:  Individual Skills Practice.  This table of fire allows shooters to practice the basic skills needed to quickly engage threats.  Techniques focus on operation of the selector lever,  cover  and  sweep,  non-standard  response,  failure  to  stop,  individual  movement techniques, use of cover and weapon transition drills.  All firing is conducted from the SRC standing position as described in the M4 Carbine Instructor’s Guide. 16.6.7.1.  Order  1,  Standard/Non-standard  Response  (Failure  to  Stop).    When  engaging enemy threats, there is no guarantee the standard response using a controlled pair renders the  enemy  unable  to  fight.    The  technique  of  firing  a  controlled  pair  and  immediately coming off target is potentially fatal.  Therefore, students learn to shoot until the enemy threat is  incapable of inflicting  harm on  friendly personnel.  The non-standard response trains personnel to keep firing until the enemy is out of the fight by attacking three key areas of the body, which include the thoracic cavity (chest), head and pelvic girdle. 16.6.7.1.1.  On  command  “LOAD,”  students  load  with  a  15-round  magazine.    On command,  “MAKE  READY,”  students  point  the  muzzle  down  range,  charge  the weapon and assume the low ready position. 16.6.7.1.2.  For  each  string  of  fire,  after  the  command  “CEASE  FIRE”  is  given, students  place  the  weapon  on  Safe,  execute  “COVER  AND  SWEEP”  and  return  to the  low  ready  position.    For  all  strings  of  fire,  students  engage  a  5-7m  “E”  target prepared as outlined in paragraph 16.6.4. 16.6.7.1.3.  Order 1, String 1.  On command, “FIRE,” students bring the weapon up into the SRC firing position and engage the target’s 10” vital zone with a controlled pair within 2 seconds. 16.6.7.1.4.  Order 1, String 2.  On command, “FIRE,” students bring the weapon up into the SRC firing position and engage the target’s 10” vital zone with a controlled pair and one round to the 6” head zone within 3 seconds. 16.6.7.1.5.  Order 1, String 3.  On command, “FIRE,” students bring the weapon up into the SRC firing position and engage  the target’s 10” vital  zone  (chest)  with  two controlled pairs within 5 seconds. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   265  16.6.7.1.6.  Order  1,  String  4.    On  command  “FIRE,”  students  bring  the  weapon  up into the SRC firing position and engage the target’s 10” vital zone, the 6” head zone and the pelvic girdle with controlled pairs within 6 seconds. 16.6.7.2.  Order  2,  Transition  to  Handgun.    The  purpose  of  this  order  of  fire  is  for students  to  execute  the  transition  to  handgun.    Students  engage  the  threat  with  the  M4 carbine  until  empty,  and  then  smoothly  transition  to  the  handgun  to  continue  to  engage the threat.  For this string of fire, students load the M4 with an empty magazine and the handgun  with  a  10-round  magazine.    Upon  the  command  of  “CEASE  FIRE,”  shooters immediately perform cover and sweep, de-cock, holster and secure pistol, re-cock the M4 carbine and assume the low ready position. 16.6.7.2.1.  Strings 1-5:  Students begin all strings of fire 30 meters from the target(s).  On  the  command,  “MOVE,”  students  begin  moving  forward  with  the  M4  at  low ready,  on  command  “CONTACT  FRONT”;  shooters  attempt  to  engage  the  target(s) with  the  M4  carbine.    When  the  weapon  fails  to  fire,  students  transition  to  the handgun and engage the target with two rounds.  Note: Properly executed, the student hears or  feels  a “click” instead of a “bang” when the trigger is  pressed.  This  is  the stimulus to immediately transition to the handgun and engage the target. 16.6.7.2.2.  Once  two  rounds  have  been  fired,  students  stop  moving,  execute  cover and  sweep  then  holster  the  handgun  to  complete  the  string.    After  holstering  the handgun, students then return to the starting point and repeat the drill 16.6.7.3.  Order  3,  Reload  on  the  Move.    The  purpose  of  this  order  of  fire  is  to  train students to reload the M4 while moving.  A moving target is harder to hit and this order of  fire  emphasizes  the  need  to  move.    Standing  still  while  attempting  to  reload  is potentially fatal!  During this order of fire, the RSO issues all verbal commands. 16.6.7.3.1.  Students  begin  50  meters  from  the  target  line.    On  command,  “LOAD,” students  load.    On  command,  “MAKE  READY,”  students  point  the  muzzle  down range,  charge  the  weapon,  ensure  the  selector  is  on  Safe  and  assume  the  low  ready position.    On  the  command,  “MOVE,”  students  begin  moving  forward  at  “combat” speed  (jog).    On  the  command,  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students  slow  to  a  fast  walk and engage the target with a controlled pair, return to combat speed and immediately execute  a  reload.    As  soon  as  the  reload  is  complete,  the  instructor  again  issues  the command  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  at  which  time  the  student  repeats  the  previous engagement and reloading techniques. 16.6.7.3.2.  This  sequence  is  repeated  until  all  magazines  have  been  expended.  During  this order  of  fire,  students  should  be  moving  quickly,  only  slowing  down  to engage threats.  They should slow down only enough to effectively steady the weapon to accurately engage the target. 16.6.7.4.  Order 4, Forward Movement (with cover).  For this order of fire, students load with  a  10-round  magazine,  no  round  in  the  chamber  and  a  10-round  magazine  in  the pouch.    Students  begin  the  string  of  fire  7-10  meters  from  the  first  barricade  with  the weapon  held  at  the  depressed  ready.    On  command,  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students move to the barricade, charge the weapon and engage the targets with controlled pairs in the following sequence:   266  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 16.6.7.4.1.  Move forward to the following positions: 16.6.7.4.1.1.  Kneeling  barricade;  engage  target  with  a  controlled  pair;  move forward. 16.6.7.4.1.2.  Standing  barricade;  engage  target  with  a  controlled  pair;  move forward. 16.6.7.4.1.3.  Kneeling  barricade;  engage  target  with  a  controlled  pair;  move forward. 16.6.7.4.1.4.  Standing  barricade;  engage  target  with  a  controlled  pairs  until empty; reload. 16.6.7.4.2.  The following commands are used by instructors/students for this order of fire: 16.6.7.4.2.1.  “MOVE UP!”  (Instructor) 16.6.7.4.2.2.  “COVER!”  (Student) 16.6.7.4.2.3.  “READY!”  (Instructor) 16.6.7.4.2.4.  “MOVING UP!”  (Student) 16.6.7.4.3.  Upon  reaching  the  last  barricade,  students  fire  all  ammunition  until expended, clear the weapon, load with 10 rounds and standby for further commands from the instructor.  There is no time limit for this order of fire.  The purpose of this drill  is  to  evaluate  safe  weapon  handling,  movement  techniques  and  proper  use  of cover.    Instructors  act  as  team  leaders  giving  the  appropriate  movement  commands and students give the appropriate replies to commands. 16.6.7.5.  Order 5, Rearward Movement (with cover).  For this order of fire, students load with a 10-round magazine, chamber empty, weapon on Safe.  Students begin the string of fire  7-10  meters  from  the  barricade.    On  command,  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  students move to the barricade, charge the weapon and engage the targets with controlled pairs in the following sequence: 16.6.7.5.1.  Move rearward to the following positions: 16.6.7.5.1.1.  Standing  barricade--engage  target  with  a  controlled  pair  and  move rearward. 16.6.7.5.1.2.  Kneeling  barricade--engage  target  with  a  controlled  pair  and  move forward. 16.6.7.5.1.3.  Standing  barricade--engage  target  with  a  controlled  pair  and  move rearward. 16.6.7.5.1.4.  Kneeling  barricade--engage  target  with  a  controlled  pairs  until empty. 16.6.7.5.2.  The  purpose  of  this  string  of  fire  is  for  students  to  move  to  and  engage targets  from  cover.    When  moving  rearward,  range  safety  officers  ensure  students properly  execute  the  correct  carry  positions  to  avoid  sweeping  other  personnel  with the  muzzle  of  the  weapon.    Range  safety  officers  enforce  muzzle/trigger  finger AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   267  discipline  and  use  of  the  safety  (selector  lever)  at  all  times.    Instructors  also  ensure students properly use cover and do not expose body parts while firing.  Students place the selector lever to Safe prior to moving to the next position.  There is no time limit for this order of fire. 16.6.7.5.3.  Instructors/Students use the following commands for this order of fire: 16.6.7.5.3.1.  “MOVE BACK!”  (Instructor) 16.6.7.5.3.2.  “COVER!”  (Student) 16.6.7.5.3.3.  “READY!”  (Instructor) 16.6.7.5.3.4.  “MOVING UP!”  (Student) 16.6.8.  Table  II:    SMC  Team  Skills  (Forward  and  Rearward  Movement).    The  purpose  of this  table  of  fire  is  to  teach  students  to  shoot,  move  and  communicate  as  a  two-member  or four-member fire team while engaging enemy threats.  The highest-ranking team member is designated the leader.  The leader issues all movement commands.  For all orders of fire in this table, RSOs ensure proper muzzle, trigger finger discipline and that students do not move in front of or sweep their partner while moving or engaging threats.  Throughout this table, students should reload from behind cover. 16.6.8.1.  Order 1, Two-Member Cover Drills.  The purpose of this order fire is to teach students to operate as a team while engaging multiple threats.  Teams engage four targets placed at 50 meters from the first barricade.  Each student covers a sector approximately 45  degrees  from  their  centerline,  extending  from  their  10  o’clock  to  12  o’clock  (left member) or 12 o’clock to 2 o’clock (right member).  Each of these sectors should contain approximately two of the four targets.  The objective is for team members to demonstrate proper use of cover and communication while maintaining steady suppressive fire on all targets.  Students conduct reloads behind cover. 16.6.8.1.1.  Students  begin  with  1,  10-round  magazine  and  2,  5-round  magazines  in their  pouches.    On  command,  “Load,”  students  load  a  magazine.    Note:  Since  two personnel  perform  this  drill,  students  should  not  begin  with  the  same  amount  of ammunition  in  the  weapon.    This  is  to  limit  the  likelihood  of  both  students  running out of ammunition at the same time. 16.6.8.1.2.  Students  begin  7-10  meters  from   On  command “CONTACT  FRONT,”  the  students  move  to  the  nearest  barricade,  charge  their weapons  and  engage  targets  within  their  sectors.    While  one  member  reloads,  the covering  team  member  engages  all  threats  until  reloading  is  complete.    During  the order of fire, team members communicate using the terms “COVER” and “READY.”  The two-member team continues this process until all ammunition is expended. the  barricade. 16.6.8.2.  Order 2, Two-Member Assault (with cover).  The purpose of this order of fire is  to  teach  students  to  shoot,  move  and  communicate  while  utilizing  cover  to  assault threats  at  close  range.    Students  apply  skills  gained  during  previous  orders  of  fire  to engage targets while advancing from 25 meters to 7 meters.  RSOs ensure students stay abreast and do not move in front of or behind their partner while engaging threats. 16.6.8.2.1.  On  command,  “LOAD,”  students  load  with  a  15-round  magazine, chamber empty, and place 1, 15-round magazines in their pouches.   268  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 16.6.8.2.2.  On  command,  “CONTACT  FRONT,”  both  students  move  to  the  nearest position  of  cover  and  charge  their  weapons.    Student  Number  1  (team  leader) provides cover fire by engaging each of two targets while Student Number 2 moves forward to another position of cover.  Once in the position of cover, Student Number 2 takes over firing on the targets while Student Number 1 moves forward to the next position of cover. 16.6.8.2.3.  This  order  of  fire  requires  one  RSO  per  student.    The  RSO  ensures  the student moving forward does not advance far enough to enter the line of fire of their team member.  Likewise, the RSO supervising the firing team member immediately intervenes  to  call  “CEASE  FIRE”  and  directs  the  student’s  muzzle  away  from  their partner should the moving team member approach the student’s line of fire.  Students place  the  selector  lever  to  Safe  prior  to  moving  to  the  next  position.    Students continue this sequence until all rounds have been expended. 16.6.8.2.4.  During reloading or stoppage clearing, the affected team member uses the term “Cover” to let their team mate know they are not firing and that the team mate is to cover their sector.  The team leader is always Student Number 1 and is responsible for issuing move commands. 16.6.8.2.5.  The following commands are used during this order of fire: 16.6.8.2.5.1.  “MOVE UP!” 16.6.8.2.5.2.  “COVER!” 16.6.8.2.5.3.  “READY!” 16.6.8.2.5.4.  “MOVING UP!” 16.6.8.2.6.  Students  continue  to  engage  targets  until  all  ammunition  has  been expended.    Upon  command  “CEASE  FIRE,”  students  clear  weapons  and  await instructions. 16.6.8.3.  Order 3, Two-Member Withdrawal (with cover).  The purpose of this order of fire  is  to teach students to shoot, move and communicate while  moving rearward under covering  fire.    Students  apply  skills  gained  during  previous  orders  of  fire  to  engage targets while withdrawing. 16.6.8.3.1.  The following commands are used during this order of fire: 16.6.8.3.1.1.  “MOVE BACK!” 16.6.8.3.1.2.  “COVER!” 16.6.8.3.1.3.  “READY!” 16.6.8.3.1.4.  “MOVING BACK!” 16.6.8.3.2.  On the command, “LOAD,” students load with a 15-round magazine and place 1, 15-round magazines in their pouches.  Students begin 7-10 meters from the barricade. 16.6.8.3.3.  On the command, “CONTACT FRONT,” both students move to the first position  of  cover,  charge  their  weapons  and  prepare  to  engage  targets.    Student AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   269  Number  1  (team  leader)  begins  to  issue  movement  commands  to  Student  Number  2 (team  member).    At  this  time,  Student  Number  1  announces  “COVER,”  to  which Student  Number  2  replies  “READY”  and  engages  all  targets  with  suppressive covering  fire.    Student  Number  1  then  removes  their  finger  from  the  trigger,  places the  weapon  on  Safe,  assumes  the  high  port  carry  position  as  appropriate,  faces  the direction  of  movement,  announces  “MOVING  BACK”  and  falls  back  to  the  next position  of  cover  as  quickly  as  possible.    Once  in  position,  Student  Number  1 commands Student Number 2 to “MOVE BACK.”  When ready,  Student Number 2 then  requests  “COVER,”  to  which  Student  Number  1  replies  “READY,”  then engages  all  targets  with  suppressive  covering  fire.    Student  Number  2  announces “MOVING BACK,” as they move back to the next position of cover.  The sequence of moving back under suppressive fire continues until both students have reached the last position of cover and all ammunition is expended. 16.6.8.3.4.  This  order  of  fire  requires  one  RSO  per  student.    Students  place  the selector lever to Safe prior to moving to the next position. 16.6.8.4.  Order 4, Fire Team Assault (with cover).  The purpose of this order of fire is to teach  students  to  shoot,  move  and  communicate  as  a  fire  team  while  utilizing  cover  to assault  threats  at  close  range.    The  fire  team  is  divided  into  two,  two-member  teams.  Students  apply  skills  gained  during  previous  orders  of  fire  to  engage  targets  while advancing from 50 meters to 10 meters. 16.6.8.4.1.  The following commands are used during this order of fire: 16.6.8.4.1.1.  “MOVE UP!” 16.6.8.4.1.2.  “COVER!” 16.6.8.4.1.3.  “READY!” 16.6.8.4.1.4.  “MOVING UP!” 16.6.8.4.2.  On  command,  “LOAD,”  students  load  with  a  15-round  magazine, chamber empty, and place a 15-round magazine in their pouch.  Students begin 7-10 meters from the barricade in the depressed ready position and face to the right or left, perpendicular to the target line. 16.6.8.4.3.  On command, “CONTACT LEFT or RIGHT,” all members immediately move  to  the  nearest  barricade  and  charge  their  weapons.    Team  Number  1  provides suppressive  cover  fire  by  engaging  all  targets  and  command  Team  Number  2  to “MOVE UP” to the next position of cover.  Team Number 2 requests “COVER,” to which  Team  Number  1  replies  “READY.”    Team  Number  2  then  announces “MOVING  UP,”  places  the  weapon  on  Safe,  assumes  the  depressed  ready  or  high port position and moves to the next covered firing position.  Once in position, Team Number  2  announces  “MOVE  UP.”    Team  Number  1  requests  Team  Number  2  to “COVER.”  Team Number 2 responds with “READY,” at which time Team Number 1  announces  “MOVING  UP.”    Team  Number  1  then  places  their  weapons  on  Safe, assumes  the  depressed  ready  or  high  port  position  and  moves  forward  to  the  next position of cover.  The teams continue moving forward until both teams reach the last position of cover.   270  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 16.6.8.4.4.  This order of fire requires one range safety officer per two-member team.  Range safety officers ensure the team moving forward does not advance far enough to enter the line of fire of the other team.  Likewise, the range safety officer supervising the  firing  team  immediately  intervenes  by  calling  “CEASE  FIRE”  and  directing  the students muzzle away from their partner should a moving team member approach the students line of fire.  Once all firing is complete, students clear weapons, assume the depressed ready position and standby for the next order of fire. 16.6.8.4.5.  The fire team leader is responsible for issuing movement commands. 16.6.8.5.  Order 5, Fire Team Withdrawal (with cover).  The purpose of this order of fire is  to  teach  students  to  shoot,  move  and  communicate  while  utilizing  cover  and  moving rearward under covering fire.  Students apply skills gained during previous orders of fire to  engage  targets  while  withdrawing.    This  order  of  fire  requires  one  RSO  per  two-member team. 16.6.8.5.1.  The following commands are used during this order of fire: 16.6.8.5.1.1.  “MOVE BACK!” 16.6.8.5.1.2.  “COVER!” 16.6.8.5.1.3.  “READY!” 16.6.8.5.1.4.  “MOVING BACK!” 16.6.8.5.2.  On  command,  “LOAD,”  students  load  with  a  15-round  magazine,  with chamber empty and place a 15-round magazine in their pouch.  Students begin 7-10 meters from the barricade in the depressed ready position and face to the right or left, perpendicular to the target line. 16.6.8.5.3.  On command, “CONTACT LEFT or RIGHT,” students move to the first position  of  cover  and  charge  their  weapons.    The  Team  Number  1  (Team  Leader) begins  to  issue  commands  to  Team  Number  2.    At  this  time,  Team  Number  1 commands  “MOVE  BACK.”    Team  Number  2  then  requests  “COVER,”  to  which Team  Number  1  responds  with  “READY”  and  engages  all  targets  with  suppressive covering  fire.    Team  Number  2  then  places  the  weapons  on  Safe,  assumes  the  high port position, faces to the rear and announce “MOVING BACK,” as they fall back to the next position of cover as quickly as possible.  Once in position, Team Number 2 commands  Team  Number  1  to  “MOVE  BACK.”    Team  Number  1  then  requests “COVER,”  to  which  Team  Number  2  responds  with  “READY”  and  engages  all targets with suppressive covering fire.  Team Number 2 places their weapons on Safe, assumes the high port position and announces “MOVING BACK,” as they fall back to the next position of cover.  The teams continue this sequence of fire and maneuver until they reach the last barricade and all rounds have been expended. 16.6.9.  Table  III,  Shoot,  Move  and  Communicate  Team  Skills  (Lateral  Movement).    The purpose of this table of  fire  is  to  teach students how to  shoot,  move and communicate as  a two-member team while engaging enemy threats.  For all orders of fire in this Table, RSOs ensure proper muzzle and trigger finger discipline and that students do not move in front of or sweep their partner while moving or engaging threats.  Students should reload from behind cover. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   271  16.6.9.1.  Order  1,  Two-Member  Lateral  Movement  (with  cover).    The  purpose  of  this order of fire is to teach students to shoot, move, and communicate while utilizing cover and  moving  laterally  to  engage  threats.    Students  apply  skills  gained  during  previous orders of fire to engage targets. 16.6.9.1.1.  The following commands are used during this order of fire: 16.6.9.1.1.1.  “MOVE LEFT/RIGHT!” 16.6.9.1.1.2.  “COVER!” 16.6.9.1.1.3.  “READY!” 16.6.9.1.1.4.  “MOVING LEFT/RIGHT!” 16.6.9.1.2.  On  command,  “LOAD,”  students  load  with  a  15-round  magazine, chamber empty and place a 15-round magazine in their pouch.  Students begin 7-10 meters  from  the  barricade  in  the  Depressed  Ready  position  and  face  to  the  right  or left, perpendicular to the target line.   Student  Number  2  responds  with  “COVER.” 16.6.9.1.3.  On command, “CONTACT RIGHT or LEFT,” both students move to the first  position  of  cover,  on  the  right  side  of  the  range  and  charge  their  weapons.  Student  Number  1  (Team  Leader)  provides  suppressive  cover  fire  by  engaging  all targets and commands  Student Number 2 to  “MOVE LEFT”  to  the next  position of cover.   Student  Number  1 acknowledges with “READY,” after which Student Number 2 announces “MOVING LEFT,”  places  the  weapon  on  Safe,  assumes  the  depressed  ready  or  high  port  carry position  and  move  left  by  traveling  behind  Student  Number  1  to  the  next  covered firing  position.    As  students  pass  behind  each  other,  they  slap  the  covering  team member on the shoulder to let them know they are passing by.  Once Student Number 2  is  in  place,  they  issue  the  “Move  Left”  command.    Student  Number  1  requests, “COVER.”  Student Number 2 announces “READY.”  Student Number 1 announces “MOVING  LEFT”  and  moves  behind  Student  Number  1  to  the  next  covered  firing position.    The  team  continues  moving  to  the  left  until  one  member  reaches  the  last position  of  cover.    At  this  time,  the  two-member  team  reverses  direction  and  re-accomplishes the sequence while moving laterally to the right.  Students remove their finger from the trigger and place the selector lever to Safe prior to moving to the next position.    Ensure  teams  demonstrate  safe  weapon  handling,  proper  communication, cover and movement techniques.  Ensure teams also maintain suppressive fire on the targets while other teammates are moving. 16.6.9.2.  Order 2, Fire Team Lateral Movement (with cover).  The purpose of this order of  fire  is  to  teach  students  to  shoot,  move,  and  communicate  while  utilizing  cover  and moving laterally to engage threats.  Students apply skills gained during previous orders of fire to engage targets while moving laterally.  Students reload from behind cover.  This order of fire requires one range safety officer per two-member team.  Students place the selector lever to Safe prior to moving to the next position. 16.6.9.2.1.  The following commands are used during this order of fire: 16.6.9.2.1.1.  “MOVE LEFT/RIGHT!” 16.6.9.2.1.2.  “COVER!”   272  AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016 16.6.9.2.1.3.  “READY!” 16.6.9.2.1.4.  “MOVING LEFT/RIGHT!” 16.6.9.2.2.  On  command,  “LOAD,”  students  load  with  a  15-round  magazine, chamber empty and place a 15-round magazine in their pouches.  Students begin 7-10 meters from the barricade in the depressed ready position and face to the right or left, perpendicular to the target line. 16.6.9.2.3.  On command, “CONTACT RIGHT OR LEFT,” both two-member teams move  to  the  first  positions  of  cover  on  the  left  side  of  the  range.    Team  Number  1 provides suppressive cover fire by engaging all targets and commands Team Number 2  to  “MOVE  RIGHT”  to  the  next  position  of  cover.    Team  Number  2  requests “COVER,”  to  which  Team  Number  1  replies  “READY.”    Team  Number  2  then announces “MOVING RIGHT,” places their weapons on Safe, assumes the depressed ready  or  high  port  position  and  moves  right  behind  the  covering  team  to  the  next covered firing position.  Once in position, Team Number 1 commands Team Number 2  to  “COVER.”    Team  Number  2  engages  the  targets  and  provides  suppressive covering  fire  for  Team  Number  1  to  move.    Team  Number  2  responds  with “READY,”  at  which  time  Team  Number  1  announces  “MOVING  RIGHT.”    Team Number  1  then  places  their  weapons  on  Safe,  assumes  the  depressed  ready  or  high port position and moves right behind Team Number 2 to the next position of cover.  The teams continue moving to the right until reaching the last position of cover.  At this time, the teams reverse  direction and re-accomplish the sequence  while  moving laterally to the left. AFMAN36-2655  12 AUGUST 2016   273  Figure 16.1.
