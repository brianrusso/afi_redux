SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  revision  makes  a  number  organizational  updates,  clarifications  and  administrative  and formatting  changes.    Specific  administrative  and  formatting  changes  include:    adding  tiering requirements;  updating  publication  references,  examples  and  offices  symbols;  numbers  the narrative parts of the standard structures for ease of reference and to facilitate future updates; and adding  descriptions  for  the  standard  squadrons  depicted  in  this  AFI.    The  revision  updates organization size guidance to incorporate specialized organization size guidance for Air Reserve Component, medical and comptroller units.  It also adds a note to the organization size guidance regarding  upcoming  changes  to  the  source  for  contractor  information,  clarifies  guidance  on student  population  included  in  organization  sizing,  adds  guidance  on  Foreign  National  Indirect Hire civilians, and renumbers sections as needed.  The revision incorporates approved changes to functional  organization  structures:    makes  Wing  Staff  changes  to  update  responsibilities  for Inspector  General  and  Plans  functions;  updates  Information  Protection  and  Equal  Opportunity descriptions; realigns the Antiterrorism Officer from wing level to the Security Forces Squadron; adds  Installation  Resilience  Program  reference;  updates  the  Comptroller  Squadron  to  reflect realignment  of  resource  advisors;  adds  options  regarding  alignment  of  Intelligence  in  the Operations  Group  and  Operations  Support  Squadron;  adds  detail  and  standardized  Office Symbol Codes to the Operations Squadron; updates the operations squadron structure for Missile Squadrons; the Communications  Squadron  to  the  Operations  Support  Squadron;  eliminates  the  Maintenance Operations  Squadrons,  adds  Maintenance  Squadron  for  Missile  Organizations  and  updates  the Maintenance  Group  to  reflect  realignment  of  maintenance  operations  functions  to  it;  revises Missile  Maintenance  Squadron  flight  descriptions;  changes  the  Office  Symbol  Codes  in  the Contracting  Squadron;  updates  the  Civil  Engineer  (CE)  Squadron  due  to  CE  transformation; changes  Honor  Guard  alignment  within  the  Force  Support  Squadron;  and  revises  the  Logistics Readiness Squadron due to functional updates.  The revision makes a number of minor updates to  the medical  unit structures including:    addressing  functional  advisors;  reflecting realignment of  the  Drug  Demand  Reduction  Program  from  the  Mental  Health  Flight  in  the  Medical Operations  Squadron  to  under  the  wing  commander;  updating  Aerospace  and  Operational Physiology  Flight  name  in  Medical  Operations  Squadron  and  Aerospace  Medicine  Squadron; eliminating  Trainee  Health  flights  from  the  Aerospace  Medicine  Squadron  and  Health  and Wellness  Centers  from  the  Health  Promotion  Flight  in  the  Aerospace  Medicine  Squadron;  and updating  the  Inpatient  Operations  Squadron  and  Surgical  Operations  Squadron  Perioperative Flight and Surgical Services Flight descriptions, respectively, to change central sterile supply to sterile  processing  department.    The  revision  updates  Office  Symbol  Code  (OSC)  guidance, including updating the character limit for office OSC titles in data systems and adding guidance realigns  Ground  Radar  and  Airfield  Systems responsibilities from AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 3 relevant  to  OSCs as used in  MPES that was recently deleted from  AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official  Communications.    It  adds  or  modifies  information  for  certain  types  of  organizations based  on  recent  reorganizations  (Component  MAJCOM,  Complex,  Center,  Named  Component Headquarters,  Air  Operations  Centers,  and  Commanders  Support  Staff).    It  clarifies  named activity information and adds a triennial review.  It adds a note to HQ USAF definition advising that additional information on HQ USAF can be found in AFMD 1, Headquarters Air Force.  It modifies  Figure  2.1,  Organizational  Schemes,  to  reflect  addition  of  complexes  and  make formatting  changes  for  clarity.    It  clarifies:    language  concerning  commandants  and  fixes paragraph numbering; that standard structures apply to units designated as flights vs. squadrons due to organization size guidance and to similarly named units that include Special Operations in their designations; that  guidance  concerning  attachment of wing staff personnel  to  Comptroller Squadrons  also  applies  to  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  Comptroller  Flights;  authority  for detachment  and  operating  location  actions;  language  on  linking  A-staff  OSCs  in  MAJCOM headquarters;  wording  on  certain  Organization  Change  Request  (OCR)  questions  (3,  6  and  8); guidance  for  reassignment  of  units  between  commands;  guidance  on  when  an  OCR  is  not required  for  a  unit  action  due  to  inclusion  in  a  Program  Action  Directive,  force  structure inactivation, etc.; and some aspects of action effective dates as they relate to DAF/A1M letters.  In  addition,  it  clarifies  and  updates  some  areas  of  the  provisional  unit  guidance.    It  adds  a reminder about various types of notification requirements.  It adds reference to appropriate AFIs for  management  headquarters  activity  guidance.    It  updates  size  guidance  associated  with establishment of squadron sections.  It revises language on Air Force Elements to clarify that it does  not  apply  to  other  types  of  elements.    Status  Change  is  added  to  the  Organizational Terminology.  It updates detachment & operating location information.  It deletes references to A7.  Chapter 1— AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION OBJECTIVES, PRINCIPLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  1.1.

Organization  Objectives.  Air  Force  organizations  are  designed characteristics outlined in AFPD 38-1. to  achieve the 1.2.  Organization  Principles.  Air  Force  organizational  structure  follows  these  management principles: 1.2.1.  Emphasis  on  Wartime  Tasks.  Organizations  are  structured  to  accomplish  wartime tasks without reorganizing. 1.2.2.  Functional  Grouping.  Organizations  have  these  characteristics:  a  clear-cut  purpose, goal and scope, with one individual in charge; parts that form a logical, separable activity; a close  relationship  among  the  parts,  constituting  a  complete  entity;  and  natural  divisions  of work that clearly define where responsibility begins and ends. 1.2.3.  Lean  Organizational  Structures.  Organizations  should  encourage  rapid  decision making,  so  they  should  be  flat  structures  without  intermediate  levels,  unless  mission requirements cannot otherwise be met. When used, intermediate organizations should consist of  tactical  functions  only,  without  a  full  range  of  staff  functions.  Organizational  levels  that exist  only  to  review  and  transmit  information  or  tasking  should  be  eliminated.  Both  the number  of  supervisors  and  the  number  of  internal  subdivisions  within  organizations  should be designed to minimize layers and maximize worker-to-supervisor ratios. 1.2.4.  Skip-Echelon  Structure.  Major  commands  (MAJCOM)  sit  on  top  of  a  skip-echelon staffing structure. MAJCOMs, wings and squadrons possess the full range of staff functions needed  to  perform  required  tasks.    Numbered/named  air  forces  (NAF),  groups  and  flights have  no  or  minimal  staff.  These  tactical  echelons  are  designed  to  increase  operational effectiveness  rather  than  to  review  and  transmit  paperwork.  The  chain  of  command  and responsibility for mission accomplishment runs through commanders at all levels. Problems, however,  often  are  solved  by  staff  communication  through  the  functional  chain,  bypassing echelons  where  the  function  is  not  found.    (Note:    Component  NAFs  (C-NAFs)  possess  a broader  staff  to  support  the  Air  Force  component  commander;  see  Paragraph  2.2.5.2  and Figure 3.2.) 1.2.5.  Standard  Levels.  The  Air  Force  uses  the  standard  levels  described  in  Chapter  2  to design  organizations.  Establish  organizations  at  the  lowest  level  required  to  successfully accomplish the primary mission. Factors such as scope of responsibility, span of control and functional grouping of related missions/activities are the predominant factors that determine organizational type. 1.3.  Responsibilities Assigned: 1.3.1.  Headquarters US Air Force (HQ USAF) and the MAJCOMs, field operating agencies (FOA),  and  direct  reporting  units  (DRU)  work  toward  meeting  Air  Force  organizational goals. The Director of Manpower, Organization and Resources (AF/A1M) is responsible for 10 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 leading  and  monitoring  progress.  HQ  USAF  functional  chiefs  give  assistance  in  their functional areas. 1.3.2.  AF/A1M is  responsible for the administrative control of all units in the Air Force. It publishes Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) letters, which are the legal authority for a unit and authorize such actions as unit activations, redesignations and inactivations. 1.3.3.  MAJCOMs, FOAs, and DRUs must follow the organizational procedures and standard structures described herein. (T-1) A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU must have AF/A1M approval to  deviate  from  a  standard  structure  and  to  activate,  redesignate,  or  inactivate  units  (see Chapter  6  for  procedures).  (T-1).    MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  approve  non-standard organizational  structures  while  adhering  to  applicable  guidance.    HQ  USAF  offices, designated  FOAs  and  other  supported  organizations  work  with  the  HQ  USAF  Resources Directorate (SAF/AAR) for approval of non-standard organizational structures. 1.3.4.  Individual  unit commanders must use the standard organizational  structures found in this Instruction.  (T-1). If a unit's unique mission or location requires a different structure, a waiver to the standard structure can be requested using the organizational change procedures found in Chapter 6.  Units work with their servicing Manpower and Organization activity on such requests (for most field units, this activity is in the Manpower and Personnel Flight of the base Force Support Squadron). AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 11 Chapter 2 STANDARD LEVELS OF AIR FORCE ORGANIZATION & ASSOCIATED TERMS (Note:  See Chapter 4 for related terminology and procedures.) 2.1.  Organizational  Entities.  The  Air  Force  is  comprised  of  establishments,  units,  and nonunits. 2.1.1.  Establishment.  An  organizational  entity  consisting  of  a  headquarters  unit  and  its subordinate units. The name of the establishment is in the name of the headquarters unit. For example, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is an establishment; HQ AMC is its headquarters. Subordinate units are assigned to the establishment and not to the headquarters unit. 2.1.1.1.  A group with subordinate squadrons is generally the lowest-level establishment. Lower-level  establishments  are  assigned  to  higher-level  ones;  for  example:  groups  to wings,  wings  to  NAFs,  NAFs  to  MAJCOMs,  MAJCOMs  to  HQ  USAF.  This arrangement  (units  reporting  to  establishments,  subordinate  establishments  to  superior ones) sets up the chain of command, through which all control and accountability flow. 2.1.1.2.  Establishments  facilitate  organizational  actions.  For  example,  the  reassignment of  a  wing  (establishment)  from  one  NAF  to  another  automatically  reassigns  the  wing's subordinate units. 2.1.2.  Unit. A military organization constituted by HQ USAF or, for provisional units only, designated by a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU. A unit is either named or numbered. 2.1.2.1.  A unit helps provide for an unbroken chain of command since military personnel are  assigned  to  a  unit  at  all  times.  Normally,  a  unit  having  military  members  has  an officer  designated  as  its  commander.  A  civilian  may  lead  a  unit  in  approved circumstances,  and  provide  supervision  to  military  and  civilian  personnel  in  the  unit. Appointment  of  a  civilian  to  lead  a  unit  designates  that  unit  as  civilian-led.  When  a civilian is appointed to lead a unit, that individual is the director of that unit. (In the case of  a  civilian-led  unit,  the  chain  of  command  is  maintained  by  having  it  reside  with  the first military unit commander above the civilian-led unit.) 2.1.2.1.1.  Civilians  cannot  assume  military  command  or  exercise  command  over military  members  within  the  unit.  Units  designated  to  be  led  by  directors  will  not have  commanders  and  alternative  arrangements  for  functions,  which  are  performed by  commanders,  are  required  (see  AFI  51-604,  Appointment  to  and  Assumption  of Command). (T-0). A civilian director of a unit is authorized to perform all functions normally  performed  by  a  unit  commander  of  like  position  and  authority  except  as required  by  law  (e.g.,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ))  or  controlling superior  authority  (e.g.,  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  guidance,  instruction  by  a superior  commander).    For  guidance  concerning  whether  an  authority  or  action  is explicitly  reserved  for  military  commanders,  contact  the  servicing  staff  judge advocate. 2.1.2.2.  The following terms apply to a unit: 12 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 2.1.2.2.1.  Active Unit. A MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU constituted and activated by HQ USAF;  or  a  subordinate  unit  constituted  by  HQ  USAF,  assigned  to  a  MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU and activated by special order. 2.1.2.2.2.  Inactive  Unit.  A  unit  constituted  by  HQ  USAF  but  not  yet  activated  or  a unit constituted, activated and subsequently, inactivated. 2.1.2.2.3.  Disbanded  Unit.  A  unit  whose  legal  authority  for  existence  is  withdrawn by HQ USAF. Its designation is retired and preserved in historical records. 2.1.2.2.4.  Parent  Unit.  An  organization  that  directly  administers  units,  detachments, or operating locations assigned to it. 2.1.2.2.5.  Provisional  Unit.  A  temporary  unit  organized  to  perform  a  specific  task.  (See Chapter 8 for guidance on provisional units.) 2.1.2.2.6.  Attached Unit. A unit, or part of a unit, placed under the control of another organization for a specific purpose such as operational control, administrative control, or logistic support. It is still assigned to the parent unit. 2.1.2.2.7.  Detached Unit. A unit serving away from its organization of assignment. It may function independently, or may be attached to another organization. 2.1.2.2.8.  Primary  Subordinate  Unit  (PSU).  A  unit  that  performs  part  or  all  of  the primary  mission  of  the  organization  to  which  it  is  assigned.  The  unit  reports  to  the commander  of  the  parent  organization  and  has  full  authority  to  execute  its  assigned mission.    A  PSU’s  purpose  is  to  perform  part  of  its  parent  organization’s  main mission  and  not  to  provide  support  functions  for  its  parent  headquarters.    Under  a MAJCOM,  examples  include  NAFs,  Air  University  (AETC)  and  the  Air  Force  Life Cycle Management Center (AFMC).  Similarly, under a wing, squadrons are PSUs of their group and the groups are PSUs of the wing. 2.1.3.  Nonunit. An organizational entity that is not constituted by HQ USAF as a unit. 2.1.3.1.  The following terms apply to a nonunit: 2.1.3.1.1.  Named Activity. A part of a unit whose mission can be identified better by assigning  it  a  definitive  name  (for  example,  the  Civil  Engineer  School  is  part  of  a unit,  the  Air  Force  Institute  of  Technology).  HQ  USAF  is  responsible  for administering the designation, redesignation and inactivation of named activities and authorizes  them  by  issuing  DAF/A1M  letters.    Every  three  years,  AF/A1MO  will conduct  a  review  with  the  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  DRUs  and  SAF/AAR  to  validate  the continuing  requirement  and  proper  alignment  of  named  activities.    Note:    Activity should  not  be  used  in  unit  designations  to  avoid  confusion  with  named  activities (which are nonunits). 2.1.3.1.2.  Detachment. Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent unit.  Although  not  a  unit  for  organizational  purposes,  if  a  commissioned  officer  is assigned  and  appointed  on  orders  as  a  commander,  the  commander  has  nonjudicial punishment  authority  under  the  UCMJ  unless  withheld  by  superior  competent authority (see AFI 51-202, Nonjudicial Punishment). AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 13 2.1.3.1.3.  Operating Location. Part of a unit that is separated geographically from its parent unit. It is used to account for personnel by location. Personnel remain assigned to the parent unit. An operating location has none of the administrative attributes of a unit and does not have nonjudicial punishment authority under the UCMJ. 2.1.3.1.4.  Squadron Section. A function responsible for the administrative control of all members assigned to a unit. A squadron section is created by appointing a section commander  on  special  orders  in  accordance  with  guidance  in  AFI  51-604.  A squadron section commander has nonjudicial  punishment authority under the UCMJ unless  withheld  by  superior  competent  authority  (see  AFI  51-202).    Section commanders at other organizational levels may use a term reflecting their unit level, e.g., Group Section Commander, etc. 2.1.3.1.5.  Commanders  Support  Staff.    A  function  responsible  for  providing  direct support  for  a  unit  or  section  commander,  primarily  in  administering  unit  personnel and administrative programs.  In squadrons, the function uses the office symbol code (OSC) “CCQ” and OSC title “Orderly Room.”  Above the squadron level, the OSC is “CSS” and the office title is “Commanders Support Staff.”  When there is a squadron section, this function falls under it. 2.1.3.1.6.  Air  Force  Element.  A  non-unit  nomenclature  used  to  account  for manpower  authorizations  and  to  identify  Air  Force  personnel  on  duty  with organizations outside the Air Force, such as defense agencies, defense field activities and  Air  National  Guard  units  not  in  federal  service.  Although  not  a  unit  for organizational purposes, an Air Force Element may function as a unit if so designated by competent authority, an eligible commissioned officer either assumes command or is appointed to command and Air Force members are assigned or attached to the Air Force Element (see Paragraph 4.3.3.5). 2.2.  Standard  Levels  of  Air  Force  Organization.  The  following  standard  levels  of organization are used in structuring and designating Air Force units: (Note:  Consult AFI 38-204, Programming USAF Manpower, and AFI 38-202, Air Force Management Headquarters and Headquarters Support Activities, for direction on how Major DoD Headquarters Activities guidance affects certain types of USAF organizations, in particular, HQ USAF, MAJCOMs, FOAs, DRUs and NAFs.) 2.2.1.  Headquarters  US  Air  Force  (HQ  USAF).  The  senior  headquarters  of  the  Air  Force, consisting of two major entities: the Secretariat (including the Secretary of the Air Force and the  Secretary's  principal  staff)  and  the  Air  Staff,  headed  by  the  Chief  of  Staff.    Note:  Detailed information on HQ USAF’s mission, command structure and responsibilities can be found in Air Force Mission Directive (AFMD) 1, Headquarters Air Force. 2.2.2.  Major Command (MAJCOM). A major subdivision of the Air Force that is assigned a major  part  of  the  Air  Force  mission.    A  MAJCOM  is  directly  subordinate  to  HQ  USAF.  Most MAJCOMs have the word Command as part of their designation; Command should not be used in the designation of any unit that is not a MAJCOM.  MAJCOM headquarters have the  full  range  of  functional  staff  (excluding  functions  that  have  been  centralized  elsewhere for Air Force-wide execution).  MAJCOMs, in turn, may be subdivided according to either of the  organizational  schemes  shown  in  Figure  2.1.    The  levels  in  each  scheme  are  in 14 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 descending  order  and  represent  levels  of  assignment.    A  unit  cannot  be  assigned  to  an organization  of  equivalent  or  lower  level.    For  example,  a  group  can  be  assigned  to  any organization  listed  above  it,  but  a  group  cannot  be  assigned  to  another  group  or  to  a squadron. Figure 2.1.  Organizational Schemes. Unit Oriented Scheme Major Command NAF Wing Group Squadron Flight Scheme with Major Non-Unit Organizations - The terms below “Complex” represent internal staff structure and are not units as defined in Paragraph 2.1.2. Major Command Center Complex Directorate (limited use) Division Branch Section  2.2.2.1.  Lead  MAJCOM.    A  type  of  MAJCOM  that  consolidates  responsibilities  for  a particular  function in  a single MAJCOM, supporting the entire Air  Force  as applicable.  For example, Air Education and Training Command is the Lead MAJCOM for education and training. 2.2.2.2.  Component  MAJCOM  (C-MAJCOM).    A  type  of  MAJCOM  that  is  the  USAF component  to  a  Unified  Combatant  Command.    For  example,  Pacific  Air  Forces (PACAF)  is  a  C-MAJCOM  that  is  the  USAF  component  to  United  States  Pacific Command  (USPACOM).    A  C-MAJCOM  is  commanded  by  the  Commander  of  Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) and includes supporting staff and all assigned and attached forces.    A  C-MAJCOM  may  have  one  or  more  C-NAFs  through  which  it  presents  its forces  to  the  Combatant  Commander  (CCDR).    The  C-MAJCOM  integrates,  at  the strategic level, component activities across all phases of conflict.  The C-MAJCOM staff should not duplicate the functions of the C-NAF AFFOR staff or Air Operations Center (AOC)  (see  Figure  3.2).    The  C-MAJCOM  commander  is  the  CCDR’s  theater COMAFFOR  and  may  function  as  a  theater  Joint  Force  Air  Component  Commander (JFACC)  when  required.    Refer  to  Air  Force  Doctrine  Volume  3,  Command,  for additional information on component relationships and roles.  Note:  A MAJCOM can be both a C-MAJCOM and a Lead MAJCOM. 2.2.3.  Direct Reporting Unit (DRU). A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to the Chief of Staff, US Air Force. A DRU performs a mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOMs. A DRU has many of the same administrative and organizational responsibilities as a MAJCOM. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 15 2.2.3.1.  Major Command Direct Reporting Unit (MAJCOM DRU). DRU also applies to a  subdivision  of  a  MAJCOM.  A  MAJCOM  DRU  reports  directly  to  the  MAJCOM commander and performs a mission that does not fit into any of the MAJCOM's primary subordinate units.  (Note:  See Paragraph 6.2.4. for additional guidance on establishment of DRUs or MAJCOM DRUs.) 2.2.4.  Field Operating Agency  (FOA). A subdivision of the Air Force, directly subordinate to a HQ USAF functional manager.  A FOA performs field activities beyond the scope of any of the major commands.  The activities are specialized or associated with an Air Force-wide mission and should minimize staff functions.  Air Force FOAs usually have the word Agency as part of their designation; Agency should not be used in the designation of any unit that is not  a  FOA  directly  under  HQ  USAF.    Note:    Organization  guidance  for  MAJCOMs  also applies to the large Air Force FOAs that are structured along MAJCOM lines. 2.2.4.1.  Major Command Field Operating  Agency  (MAJCOM FOA).  FOA also  applies to  a  subdivision  of  a  MAJCOM.  A  MAJCOM  FOA  reports  directly  to  a  MAJCOM functional  principal (e.g., 2-letter office such  as director) and performs specialized field activities  beyond  the  scope  of  any  of  the  MAJCOM's  primary  subordinate  units.  The activities are specialized and are associated with MAJCOM or theater-wide missions that transcend  the  scope  of  routine  wing  functions.  FOAs  should  minimize  staff  functions.  (Note:    See  Paragraph  6.2.4.  for  additional  guidance  on  establishment  of  FOAs  or MAJCOM FOAs.) 2.2.5.  Numbered/Named Air Force (NAF). A level of command directly under a MAJCOM.  NAFs provide operational leadership and supervision.  A NAF is assigned subordinate units, such as wings, groups and squadrons.  They do not have complete functional staffs. 2.2.5.1.  NAFs  designated  as  component  NAFs  (C-NAF)  support  the  Air  Force component  commander  (COMAFFOR)  at  the  operational  and  tactical  level.    When designated  as  the  Air  Force  component  to  a  Unified  Combatant  Command  (UCC),  the component NAF will function at the strategic, operational and tactical level.  A C-NAF is authorized a broader staff as depicted in Figure 3.2. 2.2.5.2.  The number of persons assigned to a NAF headquarters varies from case to case, but,  with  the  exception  of  C-NAFs,  should  not  exceed  99  manpower  authorizations without an approved waiver from AF/A1M.  The size of the C-NAF headquarters staff is not limited to 99 manpower authorizations. 2.2.6.  Wing.  A  level  of  command  below  the  NAF  or  higher  headquarters.    A  wing  has  a distinct  mission  with  significant  scope.    A  wing  is  usually  composed  of  a  primary  mission group  (e.g.,  operations,  training)  and  the  necessary  supporting  groups.    By  pulling  together the  mission  and  support  elements,  a  wing  provides  a  significant  capability  under  a  single commander.  It is often responsible for maintaining the installation. A wing will have several squadrons  in  more  than  one  dependent  group.  (T-1).  Wings  will  have  a  minimum  adjusted population of at least 1,000 per Paragraph 2.2.15. (T-1). A wing may be either an operational wing, an air base wing, or a specialized mission wing. 2.2.6.1.  Operational Wing. A wing that has an operations group and related operational mission activity assigned to it. When an  operational wing performs the primary mission of the base, it usually maintains and operates the base. In addition, an operational wing is 16 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 capable  of  self-support  in  functional  areas  like  maintenance,  supply  and  conventional munitions,  as  needed.  When  an  operational  wing  is  a  tenant  organization,  the  host organization provides it with varying degrees of base and logistics support. 2.2.6.2.  Air  Base  Wing.  A  wing  that  performs  a  support  rather  than  an  operational mission.  It  maintains  and  operates  a  base.  An  air  base  wing  sometimes  provides functional support to a MAJCOM headquarters. 2.2.6.3.  Specialized  Mission  Wing.  A  wing  that  performs  a  specialized  mission  and usually  does  not  have  aircraft  or  missiles  assigned  to  it.  For  example,  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance wing; training wing and so on. This wing may be either a host wing or a tenant wing, depending on whether it maintains and operates the base. 2.2.7.  Group.  A  level  of  command  between  wings  and  squadrons.  Groups  bring  together multiple squadrons or other lower echelon units to provide a broader capability. For instance, a  mission  support  group  pulls  together  several  squadrons  in  a  variety  of  areas  to  provide  a full  spectrum  mission  support  capability.  A  group  is  generally  a  tactical  echelon  without significant staff support. A group has two or more subordinate units. (T-1). Groups will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 400 per Paragraph 2.2.15. (T-1). 2.2.7.1.  Dependent  Group.  A  dependent  group  is  a  mission,  maintenance,  mission support,  medical,  or  large  functional  unit  (e.g.,  communications)  that  encompasses  a number  of  related  squadrons  to  provide  the  specified  capability  to  a  parent  wing.  Such groups  may  possess  small  supporting  staff  elements,  such  as  standardization  and evaluation or quality control that are organized as sections. 2.2.7.2.  Independent  Group.  An  independent  group  has  the  same  functions  and responsibilities  as  a  like-type  wing  but  its  scope  and  size  do  not  warrant  wing-level designation and associated overhead costs. 2.2.8.  Squadron. The basic unit in  the Air  Force. Squadrons  are the basic “building block” organizations  in  the  Air  Force,  providing  a  specific  operational  or  support  capability.  A squadron may be either a mission unit, such as an operational flying squadron, or a functional unit,  such  as  a  civil  engineer,  security  forces,  or  maintenance  squadron.  A  squadron  has  a substantive mission of its own that warrants organization as a separate unit based on factors like  unity  of  command,  functional  grouping  and  administrative  control,  balanced  with efficient use of resources. Squadrons vary in size according to responsibility, but will have a minimum adjusted population of at least 35 per Paragraph 2.2.15.  (T-1). Do not fragment a capability into multiple squadrons when a single squadron provides a parent  wing or  group commander  the  best  approach  in  terms  of  a  coordinated,  focused  capability  under  single direction. In  extreme  cases,  when  squadron  population  exceeds  700  manpower authorizations,  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  may  request  establishment  of  two  squadrons. Functional squadrons will employ the 7-series numbering convention in these instances; i.e., “XX” and “7XX” Squadrons. (T-1). 2.2.9.  Flight.  If  internal  subdivision  is  required,  a  flight  may  consist  of  sections,  then elements. A flight may be either a numbered flight, named flight, alpha flight, or a functional flight. 2.2.9.1.  Numbered/Named Flight. The lowest level unit in the Air Force. A numbered or named  flight  primarily  incorporates  smaller  elements  into  an  organized  unit  that  is AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 17 constituted  by  a  DAF/A1M  letter.  Its  administrative  characteristics,  such  as  strength reporting,  are  like  those  of  a  squadron.    As  a  unit,  it  is  authorized  a  commander.  Functions  requiring  unit  status  that  are  not  large  enough  to  be  squadrons  may  be considered for numbered/named flight level.  Because a numbered/named flight is a unit, it must be assigned to an establishment at group level or higher rather than to a squadron.  (T-1).  Examples:    497th  Combat  Training  Flight,  Air  Mobility  Command  Contracting Flight. 2.2.9.2.  Alpha Flight. Part of a squadron (usually a mission squadron) and composed of several elements performing identical missions. Because an alpha flight is not a unit, it is not subject to unit reporting.  Example:  A Flight in an operations squadron. 2.2.9.3.  Functional  Flight.  Usually  part  of  a  squadron  and  composed  of  elements performing specific missions. Because a functional flight is not a unit, it is not subject to unit reporting.  Example:  Manpower and Personnel Flight in a force support squadron. 2.2.10.  Center.    A  named  unit  that  performs  a  specialized  mission.  Typically  used  for  a larger  function  that  performs  most  of  its  mission  at  one  location  and  has  few  subordinate units such as the Space and Missile Systems Center. However, extremely large centers such as those for sustainment, life cycle management and test may have multiple subordinate units and non-units at several locations. 2.2.11.  Laboratory.  An  organization  that  performs  a  research  or  advanced  development mission. 2.2.12.  Region. A term sometimes used when organization is geographic. 2.2.13.  Complex.  A named unit that performs a related set of missions within a number of specialized facilities predominantly on one installation. Predominantly used for sustainment, research  or  development  missions;  for  example, the  air  logistics  complexes  and  the  Arnold Engineering Development Complex. 2.2.14.  Named  Component  Headquarters.    A  named  unit  that  serves  as  an  Air  Force component  to  a  Unified  Combatant  Command  (UCC).    It  is  a  command  echelon  under  a MAJCOM.  Named component headquarters plan, command, control, execute and assess air, space,  and  information  operations  across  the  full  range  of  military  operations.    Air  Force forces and units are assigned or attached as required to support the UCC. 2.2.15.  Organization Size Guidance for Wings, Groups and Squadrons. 2.2.15.1.  Adjusted population minimums are 1,000 for wings, 400 for groups and 35 for squadrons.  Adjusted populations include: 2.2.15.1.1.  Manpower authorizations as reflected in the Manpower Programming and Execution System (MPES). 2.2.15.1.2.  Average daily student load (ADSL) or, for the USAF Academy, cadets or preparatory school cadet candidates.  For the purpose of figuring adjusted populations for this AFI: 18 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Note:  ADSL can be included only for training courses approved at MAJCOM level or higher and for which the unit has significant student oversight responsibilities.  2.2.15.1.3.  A  percentage  of  the  contractor  workforce.    Specifically,  one-third  of  the Contract  Manyear Equivalents (CME) reflected in MPES for a unit may  be counted when: 2.2.15.1.3.1.  The  CME  portion  counts  for  no  more  than  30%  of  the  adjusted population used to meet unit size minimums.  In other words, before CMEs may be considered, adjusted populations are at least 700 for wings, 280 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 2.2.15.1.3.2.  The Contracting Officer’s Representative resides in the unit.  (Also referred  to  as  Contracting  Officer’s  Technical  Representative.    For  more information  see  AFI  38-203,  Commercial  Activities  Program;  the  Federal Acquisition Regulation; and the Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement.) 2.2.15.1.3.3.  This  guidance  recognizes  the  role  of  contractors  in  mission accomplishment while reflecting the reduced supervisory responsibilities.  It also ensures  USAF  units  are  made  up  of  predominantly  USAF  assets.    (Note:  SAF/AQ  is  developing  guidance  for  Contractor  Full-time  Equivalent  (CFTE) reporting which is anticipated to replace CME information at a later date.  When this occurs, use CFTE information in place of CME information for the guidance in Paragraph 2.2.15.1.3.) 2.2.15.2.  Additional specialized guidance: 2.2.15.2.1.  A  unit  reflected  as  a  squadron  in  the  Force  Tabs  may  maintain  its squadron status regardless of size.  (The Force Tabs are maintained by SAF/FMP as part of the Program Data System per AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting and Termination.) 2.2.15.2.2.  A  wing  with  other  dependent  groups  may  have  an  operations  group  if  it has  multiple  squadrons  reflected  in  the  Force  Tabs,  regardless  of  the  operations group’s size. 2.2.15.2.3.  An Associate unit may be a squadron if the unit whose weapons system(s) it  shares  is  a  squadron.    Refer  to  AFI  90-1001,  Responsibilities  for  Total  Force Integration, for further information on associated units. 2.2.15.2.4.  Additional  specialized  guidance  for  ANG  and  AFRC  units.    The  use  of standard  wing/group  organization  structures  in  the  Air  Reserve  Components  (ARC) enhances  their  ability  to  transition  smoothly  to  the  expeditionary  environment  and interface  with  Regular  Air  Force  (RegAF)  duty  forces,  although  ARC  wings  and groups are often smaller due to factors such as a more experienced work force with a smaller  trainee  population,  fewer  aircraft  at  a  location,  and  smaller  installation AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 19 support  infrastructure.    ARC  units  follow  standard  unit  size  and  organizational guidance in all other respects, except: 2.2.15.2.4.1.  Specialized  adjusted  population  minimums  for  ANG  and  AFRC units are 750 for wings and 200 for groups. 2.2.15.2.4.2.  An ANG or AFRC wing with other dependent groups may have an operations group if it has at least one operations squadron that is reflected in the Force tabs or is an associate squadron, plus at least one other unit (e.g., operations support squadron).  This is similar to the guidance for RegAF operations groups but reflects that many ARC wings have only one flying unit. 2.2.15.2.4.3.  Adjusted  populations  for  ANG  units  may  include  a  percentage  of the  state  employees.    This  recognizes  the  contribution  of  state  employees  while reflecting the differing roles and supervisory aspects. 2.2.15.2.4.3.1.  Specifically, one-third of the state employees for a unit may be counted when the state employee portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted population used to meet unit size minimums.  In other words, before state  employees  may  be  considered,  adjusted  populations  (excluding  CMEs) are at least 525 for wings, 140 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 2.2.15.2.4.3.2.  CMEs  are  excluded  from  the  adjusted  population  when assessing if the state employee portion counts for no more than 30% to ensure units  are  made  up  predominantly  of  assets  directly  associated  with  USAF.  The specified percentages of state employees and CMEs may be included in the final total adjusted population if the minimums have been met. 2.2.15.2.5.  Additional specialized guidance for medical units: 2.2.15.2.5.1.  Medical  squadrons  will  follow  the  standard  size  guidance  and applicable standard structures in this AFI. (T-1) 2.2.15.2.5.2.  Regardless  of  size,  medical  groups  are  authorized  when  all  of  the following are met: 2.2.15.2.5.2.1.  The  organization  reports  to  a  wing  per  Figure  3.3  (Wing Structure) in this AFI. 2.2.15.2.5.2.2.  The organization is structured per the medical  group standard structures in this AFI. 2.2.15.2.5.2.3.  The organization has multiple subordinate squadrons that meet standard size guidance and follow the standard structures in this AFI. 2.2.15.2.5.3.  Medical wings will follow the standard size guidance for wings and have  multiple  subordinate  groups.  (T-1).    [Note:    The  specialized  medical  unit guidance  does  not  apply  to  ARC  units  per  Figure  3.29  of  AFI  38-101  which specifies  the  standard  medical  group  structures  do  not  apply  to  the  ARC.    As  a result  of  the  organization  threshold  review  (OTR)  of  medical  units,  AF/SG addresses the ARC medical units and their structure in the Medical Flight Path.] 2.2.15.2.6.  Additional  specialized  guidance  for  comptroller  squadrons.   This additional  guidance  applies  to  comptroller  squadrons  to  recognize  their  fiduciary 20 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 requirements and responsibility for wing staff administration.  Comptroller squadrons that provide administrative and UCMJ support to their parent wing headquarters staff IAW AFI 38-101, Paragraph 3.4.11, may adjust their population to include one-third of  that  wing  staff’s  funded  military  manpower  authorizations.    This  additional population can account for no more than 30 % of the adjusted population needed to meet squadron size minimums.  In other words, before wing staff may be considered, a comptroller squadron has at least 25 funded manpower authorizations. 2.2.15.2.7.  Additional specialized guidance for overseas units with Foreign National Indirect  Hire  civilian  employees.    Adjusted  populations  for  overseas  units  may include  a  percentage  of  Foreign  National  Indirect  Hire  employees.    This  recognizes the  contribution  of  those  employees  while  reflecting  the  differing  roles  and supervisory aspects. 2.2.15.2.7.1.  Specifically, one-third of Foreign National Indirect Hire employees for  a  unit  may  be  counted  when  the  Foreign  National  Indirect  Hire  employee portion counts for no more than 30% of the adjusted population used to meet unit size  minimums.    In  other  words,  before  they  may  be  considered,  adjusted populations (excluding CMEs) are at least 700 for wings, 280 for groups and 25 for squadrons. 2.2.15.2.7.2.  CMEs are excluded from the adjusted population when assessing if the Foreign National Indirect Hire employee portion counts for no more than 30% to  ensure  units  are  made  up  predominantly  of  assets  directly  associated  with USAF.    The  specified  percentages  of  Foreign  National  Indirect  Hire  employees and CMEs may be included in the final total adjusted population if the minimums have been met. 2.2.15.3.  MAJCOM/A1Ms  will  monitor  unit  sizes  on  an  ongoing  basis  to  ensure  units are named and organized per the guidance in this Instruction. 2.2.15.4.  AF/A1M will review wing, group and squadron sizes every two years to ensure compliance with organization size guidance.  Approval levels for waivers to wing, group and squadron size guidance are shown in Table 2.1.  AF/A1M provides guidance on how to  submit  waiver  requests  during  the  biennial  reviews.    Paragraph  6.2.1.4.  provides guidance on requesting wing, group and squadron size waivers that are needed as part of an Organization Change Request at other times. Table 2.1.

MAJCOMs should strive to organize expeditionary units per  the  organization  size  guidance  but  may  authorize  variances  when  necessary  due  to factors such as operational needs, relationships with other Service or coalition forces, or AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 21 to avoid turbulence due to population fluctuations.  (See Chapter 8 for general guidance on provisional units.) 2.3.  Standard  Elements  of  Air  Force  Organization.  The  following  terms  describe  the organizational elements within command and staff functions. 2.3.1.  Command: 2.3.1.1.  Commander. An officer who occupies a position of command pursuant to orders of  appointment  or  by  assumption  of  command  according  to  AFI  51-604.    This designation is used in all Air Force units except: 2.3.1.1.1.  US Air Force Academy, which is commanded by a superintendent. 2.3.1.1.2.  Other  school  organizations,  which  may  be  commanded  by  commandants.  (Note:   Commandants of non-unit school organizations are not commanders.) 2.3.1.1.3.  A  unit  with  a  civilian  leader.  When  a  civilian  is  appointed  to  lead  a  unit, that  individual  is  the  director  of  the  unit.  A  unit  designated  to  be  led  by  a  civilian director will not have a commander, section commander or detachment commander. (T-0).  (Note:  Internal  functional  flight  heads  using  the  duty  title  of  “flight commander” may continue to use this title since they are not unit commanders with commensurate legal command authority.) 2.3.1.1.3.1.  MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU headquarters may approve designation of a unit to be led by a civilian director instead of a military commander subject to the restrictions  within  this  AFI  or  other  applicable  guidance.  HQ  USAF  approval under  the  waiver  process  in  this  AFI  is  required  for  approval  under  any  other circumstances. 2.3.1.1.3.2.  Civilian unit directors must be full-time Department of the Air Force appropriated  fund  employees  who  have  completed  any  applicable  probationary periods. (T-1). Civilian unit directors must be United States citizens. (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.  A unit will not have a civilian unit director and must have a military commander if: (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.1.  The unit is committed as a unit to a combat mission or to fill a mobility requirement. (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.2.  The unit or an organization subordinate to the unit has a flying mission. (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.3.  The unit has a medical mission. (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.4.  The unit is above wing level. (This restriction does not apply to Air Force FOA and MAJCOM FOA headquarters units.) (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.5.  The  unit  is  one  whose  leader  would  normally  function  as  an installation commander. (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.6.  The unit is an expeditionary or provisional unit. (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.3.7.  The unit is in the Air Force Reserve Command or Air National Guard.  (This  restriction  does  not  limit  traditional  Reserve  and  ANG 22 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Technician arrangements; see AFI 51-604 for additional guidance specific to Air Reserve Component commanders.) (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.4.  Since civilians cannot exercise command over military members, and no  member  of  the  unit  or  subordinate  unit  can  assume  command  of  the  unit,  a succession  plan  for  leadership  of  the  unit  should  be  established  in  the  event  the civilian  leader  is  incapacitated.    Refer  to  AFI  51-604  for  guidance  on  command authority matters for units led by civilian directors. 2.3.1.1.3.5.  Civilian  unit  leaders  will  use  an  Office  Symbol  Code  (OSC)  of  CL, Civilian Unit Leader. (T-1). Civilian unit leaders will not use the title Commander nor an OSC of CC (Commander). (T-1). 2.3.1.1.3.5.1.  Since  units  with  civilian  leaders  do  not  have  commanders,  the titles  and  OSCs  for  Vice  Commander  (CV)  and  Deputy  Commander  (CD) cannot  be  used  for  either  military  or  civilian  members  in  such  units.  When authorized, a primary subordinate who shares the civilian director’s duties and acts for the director in the director’s absence will use the title Deputy Director and the OSC of DD.  (T-1). The title Vice Director and OSC of DV may be used for such a primary subordinate at center or wing level. 2.3.1.1.3.5.2.  Civilians who are subordinates in units commanded by officers cannot  use  the  titles  Vice  Commander,  Deputy  Commander,  Deputy  to  the Commander  or  any  similar  title  which  denotes  or  implies  the  ability  to exercise command authority in a Commander’s absence.  Such civilians may use a title of Deputy and OSC of DD. 2.3.1.2.  Vice Commander. An officer who shares a commander's duties and acts for the commander  during  the  commander's  absence.  If  eligible  and  command  is  properly assumed  or  appointed  under  the  provisions  of  AFI  51-604,  a  vice  commander  may exercise  all  command  authority  during  the  assigned  commander’s  absence.  This designation is used at major command through wing level only. 2.3.1.2.1.  Where  the  Air  Force  is  the  lead  service  at  a  joint  base,  the  officer (irrespective  of  branch  of  military  Service)  designated  the  "Deputy  Joint  Base Commander" performs the functions of vice commander at wing level. 2.3.1.3.  Installation  Commander.  The  host  unit  commander  responsible  for  maintaining and  operating  the  installation.  This  individual  discharges  the  duties  directed  by  US statutes or Air Force directives to be performed by the installation commander. 2.3.1.4.  Deputy Commander. An officer who shares the commander’s duties and acts for the  commander  during  the  commander’s  absence.  If  eligible  and  command  is  properly assumed  or  appointed  under  AFI  51-604,  a  deputy  commander  may  exercise  all command authority during the assigned  commander’s  absence. This  designation is  used at group level. 2.3.2.  Staff: 2.3.2.1.  Chief of Staff (CSAF). Title held by the Chief of Staff, US Air Force, with the only variance for Component NAFs.  (See Figure 3.2 for variance for Component NAFs.) AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 23 2.3.2.2.  Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS). An officer who oversees a major portion of the Air Staff  and  who  reports  directly  to  the  CSAF.  A  DCS  supervises  the  activities  of directorates and field operating agencies. 2.3.2.3.  Director of Staff (DS) A staff element reporting  directly to the MAJCOM Vice Commander.  The  function  oversees  executive  services,  orderly  room  and  command section activities.  Wings may use this title when authorized under Air Force Manpower Standards (AFMS). 2.3.2.4.  Directorate.  A  staff  element  at  HQ  USAF  or  major  command  level.  This  is  a decision  making  level  which  performs  a  range  of  related  staff  functions.  Normally,  a directorate supervises the activities of divisions and field operating agencies. 2.3.2.4.1.  Directorates  are  also  authorized  in  large  HQ  USAF  field  operating agencies  and  in  large  centers  and  laboratories  (approximately  500  authorizations) which oversee major mission areas and key Air Force programs or support functions. 2.3.2.5.  Division. Normally aligned as a staff element in HQ USAF, a MAJCOM, NAF, center,  FOA  or  equivalent.  Divisions  supervise  the  activities  of  branches  if  the organization is large enough to require branches. Organizations that hold squadron status in the wing structure can be aligned as divisions when the head of the organization is  a civilian (e.g., Services Divisions). 2.3.2.6.  Branch. A staff element that performs a specific portion of a division's mission. Branches may  be  further subdivided into sections and elements.  Branches supervise the activities of sections and elements. However, sections and elements are only authorized if the organization performs technical, highly specialized workload or if the supervisor-to-worker  ratio  exceeds  1:10.  If  further  subdivision  of  a  branch  is  required,  a  team-leader approach is the preferred arrangement. 24 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 3 STANDARD ORGANIZATIONS 3.1.  Organization Structure.  This chapter prescribes standard organizational structures for use to the lowest level shown. Illustrative figures include approved organizational titles (Figure 3.1 through Figure 3.36).  Organization structures are illustrated to the lowest mandatory levels. HQ USAF  and  MAJCOM  functional  and  Manpower,  Organization  and  Resources  focal  points  are authorized to  develop  standard organization structures below the  mandatory level.  This  chapter also reflects standard office symbol codes. 3.1.1.  Organizational Variations. Each figure depicts a standard organizational structure for a particular  unit  or  function.  AF/A1M  must  approve  any  variations  from  standard  structure. Variations  from  standard  structures  should  have  a  clear,  overriding  purpose  that  has  easily recognizable and defensible organizational and cost benefits.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs submit  variation  requests  as  described  in  Chapter  6  of  this  Instruction  when  a  standard function does not exist at a location, when functions are combined due to small size, or when units are responsible for activities not accounted for in standard structures. 3.1.2.  Functions  and  Responsibilities.  Each  figure  depicts  the  standard  organizational structure and accompanying paragraphs list typical functions and responsibilities performed by  an  organization.  These  functions  and  responsibilities  are  not  comprehensive,  but  are intended to give an understanding of activity that fits in each organizational block. 3.1.3.  The standard squadron organizational structures prescribed in Chapter 3 also apply to units with the respective unit kinds that are organized as numbered flights due to organization size guidance.  When the unit is a numbered flight, the internal subdivisions are sections. 3.1.4.  The standard organizational structures prescribed in Chapter 3 also apply to similarly named units that include Special Operations in their designations. 3.2.  Numbered/Named  Air  Force  (NAF).  The  NAF  is  a  command  echelon  directly  under  a MAJCOM  that  is  focused  on  ensuring  the  readiness  of  assigned  forces.    It  prepares  forces  for deployment and employment. 3.2.1.  Basic NAF Structure.  The basic NAF structure is in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1.  Basic NAF Structure (Applies to NAFs that are not C-NAFs). 3.2.2.  Component NAF Structure.  The C-NAF structure is in Figure 3.2.  AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 25 Figure 3.2.  Component NAF Structure.  3.2.2.1.  A component NAF (C-NAF) is a specialized category of NAF that is structured to  perform  an  operational  and  warfighting  mission  in  support  of  a  Unified  Combatant Command (UCC).  The C-NAF is a command echelon directly under a MAJCOM.  The C-NAF  will  plan,  command,  control,  execute  and  assess  air,  space  and  information operation capabilities across the full range of military operations.  The C-NAF normally consists of an AFFOR staff and an AOC as depicted in Figure 3.2.  Air Force forces and units are assigned or attached as required to support the UCC. 3.2.2.2.  Organization  Variations.    Elements  of  Personal  Staff  should  be  reduced  or eliminated as much as practical through support agreements and reachback.  The Personal Staff  may  include  Protocol  (CCP),  Political/Military  Advisor  (CCT),  Staff  Judge Advocate  (JA),  Public  Affairs  (PA),  Historian  (HO),  Chaplain  (HC),  Safety  (SE), Surgeon  (SG),  Financial  Management  (FM),  Reserve  Affairs  (RE),  Information Protection (IP) and Inspector General (IG).  The rest of the C-NAF staff should consist of the  standard  Air  Force  A1-A9  staff  functions  (see  Figure  4.1  and  Paragraph  4.4.3  for information on A-staff OSCs).  A-staff 2-digit functions may be linked (e.g., A3 and A5 as A3/5), but separate functional staffs are maintained.  C-NAFs are authorized to use the Chief  of  Staff  (CS)  title  as  a  variance  to  Paragraph  2.3.2.1  of  this  Instruction.    C-NAF responsibilities may vary depending on the capabilities provided by the MAJCOM.   26 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 3.3.  Standard Wing. Figure 3.3.  Wing Structure.  3.3.1.  Standard  Wing  Structure  and  Responsibilities.    The  standard  wing  generates  and employs combat capability. One commander has the authority and responsibility to command the  wing.  The  standard  operational  wing  structure  is  a  wing  with  four  dependent  groups (operations,  maintenance,  mission  support  and  medical)  with  related  functions  and disciplines aligned under the appropriate  group.  Generally, only the wing staff, comptroller unit and the four group commanders report directly to the wing commander. Thus, the wing commander  concentrates  on  the  wing's  primary  mission  and  delegates  authority  to subordinates so they can accomplish their responsibilities. Major wing functions are divided among a few principal subordinates, each accountable for carrying out a specific part of the wing mission. Responsibilities are clearly defined and duplication is avoided.  Note:  While the standard wing is organized for combat operations, its basic structure is applied to all types of wings (for instance, air base and specialized mission wings). 3.3.2.  Organization  Variations.  Where  applicable,  Air  Control  Squadrons  are  part  of  the Operations  Group.  Where  applicable,  Munitions  Squadrons  are  part  of  the  Maintenance Group.  Where  applicable,  Aerial  Port  Squadrons  are  part  of  the  Mission  Support  Group.  (Note:  Aerial Port Squadron alignment is under review). 3.3.3.  Staffing  of  a  Standard  Wing.  A  wing  is  organized  as  an  operational  unit  with manpower requirements set at those levels required for mission success. A standard or core manpower  level  exists  for  each  organization  defined  in  this  Instruction  (see  AFI  38-201, Determining Manpower Requirements). AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 27  3.4.  Wing Staff. Figure 3.4.  Wing Staff Structure. 3.4.1.  Wing Staff Organization. Wing staff functions report to the wing commander. A wing staff function may be referred to as an office, for example: a public affairs office. The senior staff  member  is  referred  to  as  the  chief.    (Note:    the  below  reflects  separate  wing  staff functional offices; it does not reflect individual positions/activities immediately under the CC or  CV  as  reflected  by  CC_  or  CV_  office  symbol  codes,  such  as  the  Sexual  Assault Prevention  and  Response  (CVS),  Drug  Demand  Reduction  Program  (CVD),  or  Installation Resilience Program (CVB).)  3.4.1.1.

Organization Actions.  Use the terminology and related procedures outlined in this chapter to  make  an  organization  change.    Implementation  of  actions  is  to  be  in  accordance  with applicable  provisions  of  AFI  10-503,  Strategic  Basing.    Procedures  and  responsibilities  shown below apply to MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs.  SAF/AAR may perform these functions for their supported organizations. 4.2.  Organization Terminology: 4.2.1.  Constitute. Provide the legal authority for a new unit by designating it in a Department of the Air Force (DAF/A1M) letter. 4.2.2.  Disband. Withdraw the legal authority for a unit. The designation of the unit is retired and preserved in historical records. 4.2.3.  Reconstitute. Renew legal authorization of a disbanded unit. 4.2.4.  Activate.  Bring  into  existence  a  constituted  unit,  a  detachment  of  a  unit,  or  a provisional unit. An active unit can legally function as specified by directives. 4.2.5.  Inactivate.  End  the  existence  of  a  unit,  detachment  of  a  unit,  or  provisional  unit.  An inactive  unit  retains  its  lineage,  history  and  honors  and  is  available  for  activation  when needed again. Units should be inactivated when their mission ceases to exist and all resources are withdrawn. 4.2.6.  Designate. Give an official name (or a number and name). 4.2.7.  Redesignate. Change the name or number. 4.2.8.  Consolidate.  To  permanently  combine  two  or  more  organizations  by  merging  their lineage  into  a  single  line  to  form  a  single  organization.  Consolidation  usually  applies  to organizations that were active at different times but have the same numerical designations or similar  functions.    Units  that  have  been  active  concurrently  cannot  be  consolidated.    A consolidated unit cannot subsequently be separated. 4.2.9.  Assign. Place a unit with an existing military organization. 4.2.10.  Attach.  Place  a  unit,  or  part  of  a  unit,  with  a  military  organization  other  than  its parent  organization,  without  making  it  a  part  of  that  organization.  A  unit,  or  part  of  a  unit, may be attached for operational control, administrative control and logistic support. 4.2.10.1.  Operational Control. The authority of a commander at any echelon at or below the  level  of  CCMD  to  perform  those  function  of  command  over  subordinate  forces involving organizing and employing commands  and forces,  assigning tasks, designating objectives and giving direction necessary to accomplish the mission. 4.2.10.2.  Administrative Control. Direction or exercise of  authority  over  subordinate or other organizations in respect to administration and support.  Examples of administrative control  are  UCMJ  authority,  personnel  classification,  effectiveness  reports,  granting leaves and so on. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 69 that  organization to  carry  out  operations.  Examples 4.2.10.3.  Logistic  Support.  The  support  provided  by  one  organization  to  another, enabling include  supply, maintenance, logistics planning, transportation and contracting. An order that states a unit is attached for logistic support only clearly means operational control and administrative control are not responsibilities of the commander to which the unit is attached. The order itself  does  not  detail  the  extent  and  kind  of  logistic  support,  as  this  support  is  clarified through separate documents, such as host tenant support agreements. 4.2.11.  Allot.  Authorize a unit to be part of the Air National Guard.  DAF/A1M memos allot units to the National Guard Bureau which in turn allots them to the appropriate state, territory or the District of Columbia. 4.2.12.  Status Change.  Change the organizational status of a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU.  A status change is accomplished by a DAF/A1M memo.  Status changes are often accompanied by  a  redesignation.    For  example,  the  status  change  of  the  Air  Force  Intelligence, Surveillance  and Reconnaissance Agency from a  FOA to a subordinate organization of Air Combat Command (ACC) was accompanied by its redesignation to Twenty-Fifth Air Force. 4.3.  Organization Procedures.  The following procedures apply to organization entities within the Air Force. 4.3.1.  Establishments: 4.3.1.1.  An  establishment  is  automatically  created  when  its  headquarters  unit  is activated. 4.3.1.2.  An  establishment  is  controlled  through  its  headquarters.  However,  subordinate units  are  assigned  to  the  establishment,  not  to  the  headquarters  unit.  This  enables  each unit  within  an  establishment  to  have  a  separate  identity.  The  fact  that  the  headquarters unit  controls  the  establishment  places  the  other  units  subordinate  to  it.  Personnel  are assigned to a unit, not to an establishment. 4.3.1.3.  The  assignment  of  any  establishment  assigns  all  its  components  at  the  same time, unless otherwise specified.  For  example, when a  wing is  assigned to  an NAF, the assignment  of  the  wing's  groups  and  squadrons  also  is  to  the  NAF.  The  separation  of units by location does not affect their assignment to the establishment. 4.3.1.4.  Inactivation  of  a  headquarters  unit  automatically  inactivates  the  establishment. Units assigned to the establishment automatically revert, unless otherwise directed, to the next higher level. 4.3.2.  Units: 4.3.2.1.  HQ  USAF  issues  a  DAF/A1M  letter  to  constitute  and  activate  MAJCOMs, FOAs  and  DRUs.  For  a  unit  subordinate  to  a  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU,  HQ  USAF constitutes  the  unit  and  assigns  it  to  the  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU  for  activation.  The MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU  will  activate  and  assign  the  unit  by  issuing  a  G-Series  Order citing  the  DAF/A1M  letter  as  authority.  (T-1).  A  DAF/A1M  letter  also  can  authorize  a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU to redesignate or inactivate a unit. An inactivated unit reverts to the  control  of  HQ  USAF.  DAF/A1M  letters  and  G-Series  Orders  follow  the  formats prescribed in Chapter 7. 70 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 4.3.2.2.  A  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU  may  reassign  a  unit  internally  unless  the  unit's assignment is specified in a DAF/A1M letter or by a standard structure prescribed in this Instruction. 4.3.2.3.  A unit may be reassigned from one MAJCOM, FOA or DRU to another. In this case, the losing MAJCOM, FOA or DRU (after coordinating with the gaining MAJCOM, FOA or DRU) requests  AF/A1M approve the reassignment on a date agreed to  by both commands (if agreed to by both parties, the gaining command may make the request or the  commands  may  make  a  joint  request).  If  only  unit  reassignments  are  involved,  the DAF/A1M  letter  directs  the  reassignment  of  such  units  and  copies  are  sent  to  both commands.  If  reassignment  and  movement  occur  at  the  same  time,  the  movement directive issued per AFI 16-403 can also serve as the reassignment directive. 4.3.2.4.  The  effective  date  of  an  organization  action  (for  example,  activation, inactivation,  or  redesignation)  is  either  published  in  the  DAF/A1M  letter  or  in  orders issued  by  the  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU.  When  a  DAF/A1M  letter  allows  the  effective date to be on or about a certain date, the organization action must occur no more than 30 calendar days before or after that date. (T-1). 4.3.2.5.  Numbered  flights  are  units  and  require  the  same  organization  procedures  as other units. Alpha and functional flights, however, are not units and are not subject to this chapter's procedures. 4.3.3.  Nonunits:  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  have  the  approval  authority  to  activate, inactivate, and redesignate detachments and operating locations (OL) (see below for specifics such as how to designate them and restrictions on redesignations).  MAJCOM Manpower and Organization  focal  points  should  conduct  an  annual  detachment/OL  review  to  validate  the continuing  requirement  for  the  activity.    MAJCOM,  FOA  and  DRU  Manpower  and Organization  focal  points  and  SAF/AARM  (for  serviced  organizations)  may  approve variances  to  paragraphs  4.3.3.1.2.  and  4.3.3.2.6  below  regarding  sequencing  of  detachment and  OL  designations  if  warranted  due  to  factors  such  as  operational  needs,  to  maintain continuity,  or  to  identify  with  a  particular  related  organization  or  location  (such  as  joint bases); detachments remain numeric and OLs remain alphabetical. 4.3.3.1.  Detachments: 4.3.3.1.1.  A MAJCOM, FOA or DRU may activate a detachment for a function that is  geographically  separated  from  its  parent  unit.  A  detachment  is  activated  to  fill  a need  for  command  or  supervision,  or  for  other  reasons,  such  as  to  facilitate  unit movement. If there is a need for command authority, the senior officer on duty with a detachment  is  appointed  on  orders  as  detachment  commander.  Note:  Normally,  a geographically separated organization is  designated an operating location unless on-site command authority is required. Then, it is designated a detachment. 4.3.3.1.2.  Detachments are numbered in sequence, beginning with 1. 4.3.3.1.3.  A detachment can be redesignated to another number within the same unit. The new number  cannot duplicate a currently active detachment number  within that unit. 4.3.3.1.4.  The following redesignations cannot be made: AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 71 4.3.3.1.4.1.  A  detachment  of  one  parent  unit  to  a  detachment  of  another  parent unit. 4.3.3.1.4.2.  A detachment to a unit. 4.3.3.1.4.3.  A unit to a detachment. 4.3.3.1.4.4.  A detachment to an operating location. 4.3.3.1.4.5.  An operating location to a detachment. 4.3.3.1.5.  The inactivation of a parent unit automatically inactivates its detachments. 4.3.3.1.6.  Detachments  are  designated  as  part  of  a  unit,  not  an  establishment,  e.g., Detachment 1, 1st Fighter Squadron or Detachment 4, HQ 1st Operations Group. 4.3.3.1.7.  If a gap in sequential numbering occurs due to actions such as inactivation of a detachment, it is not necessary to take actions to change the numbers of the other detachments in the unit to fill in the gap. 4.3.3.2.  Operating Location (OL): 4.3.3.2.1.  An OL may be activated by a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU. 4.3.3.2.2.  An OL is a geographically separated location where persons are required to perform permanent duty and the command supervision or other features provided by a detachment are not needed. 4.3.3.2.3.  An OL is not a location separated from an installation to which persons are transported to work. 4.3.3.2.4.  Guidelines to  4.3.3.1.7.  above  regarding detachments also apply to operating location actions (with the understanding that OLs are designated alphabetically instead of numerically). in  Paragraphs  4.3.3.1.3. 4.3.3.2.5.  Manpower  authorizations  for  an  OL  are  reported  with  the  location  where duty is being performed. 4.3.3.2.6.  OLs are designated in alphabetical sequence, beginning with A. 4.3.3.3.  Coding Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) Data 4.3.3.3.1.  The  PAS  code  contains  data  fields  for  designating  detachments,  OLs  and staff elements. The following coding rules apply: 4.3.3.3.2.  OLs  are  designated  with  a  maximum  of  three  alphabetic  characters  in  a four-character  field.  The  first  character  of  the  OL  field  is  zero.  The  first  two characters of the OL  field are always zero for OLs designated with  two letters. The first three characters of the OL field are always zero for OL designations with a single letter  (e.g.,  OL  code  “000A”  for  OL-A,  OL  code  “00ZZ”  for  OL-ZZ,  OL  code “0ABC” for OL-ABC). 4.3.3.3.3.  If  the  OL  is  not  subordinate  to  the  detachment,  the  detachment  code  is designated  with  zeroes  (e.g.,  detachment  code  “0000”  and  OL  code  “000A”  means OL A and parent is not a detachment). 72 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 4.3.3.3.4.  If  the  OL  is  subordinate  to  the  detachment,  both  fields  are  designated independently  (e.g.,  detachment  code  “0001”  and  OL  code  “000A”  equals  OL  A  of detachment 1). 4.3.3.3.5.  Detachment and OL data fields (four characters each) are combined in the personnel system. Therefore, total non-zero characters cannot exceed four characters. 4.3.3.3.5.1.  An  OL  can  be  up  to  three  characters  if  the  detachment  number designation is one digit (1-9). 4.3.3.3.5.2.  An  OL  can  be  one  or  two  characters  if  the  detachment  number designation is two digits (10 through 99). 4.3.3.3.5.3.  An  OL  can  be  only  one  character  if  the  detachment  number designation is three digits (100 through 999). 4.3.3.3.5.4.  An  OL  cannot  be  assigned  to  a  detachment  numbered  greater  than 999.  If  it  should  become  necessary  to  establish  an  OL,  the  detachment  is redesignated using not more than three digits for identification. 4.3.3.3.5.5.  The first character of an OL or staff element data field is alphabetic if used for anything other than an OL (e.g., when establishing a separate PAS for a senior rater). 4.3.3.3.5.6.  General guidance on the PAS system is in  AFCSM 36-699, Volume 4, Personnel Accounting Symbol System Users Manual. 4.3.3.4.  Squadron  Sections.    A  commander  of  a  large  unit  (235  or  more  military authorized),  squadron  or  above,  may  delegate  administrative  control  of  all  assigned members by appointing a section commander on special orders IAW guidance in AFI 51-604. 4.3.3.4.1.  If  a  full-time  section  commander  is  not  authorized  under  a  manpower standard,  unit  commanders  may  appoint  a  section  commander  who  performs  these functions  as  an  additional  duty.    Commanders  should  exercise  discretion  to  ensure this is done only when warranted by span of control factors. 4.3.3.4.2.  See AFI 51-604 for legal guidance on appointment of section commanders.  See AFI 36-2101, Classifying Military Personnel (Officer and Enlisted), for guidance on AFSC/duty title matters. 4.3.3.5.  Air Force Elements: 4.3.3.5.1.  An  Air  Force  Element  may  be  designated  to  function  as  a  unit  by  a designating officer (described below).  The designating officer attaches the Air Force members  on  duty  with  an  organization  outside  the  Air  Force  to  the  Air  Force Element.    (Refer  to  AFI  51-604  for  the  determination  of  an  Air  Force  Element commander and/or the appointment of Air Force Element section commanders.)  The following officers have authority to designate an Air Force Element to function as a unit: 4.3.3.5.1.1.  The  Senior  Air  Force  Officer  (SAFO)  in  a  defense  agency,  defense field activity, unified or specified combatant command, joint task force, combined task  force,  coalition  force,  or  activity  outside  the  Air  Force  that  exercises AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 73 operational control over the Air Force Element. 4.3.3.5.1.2.  The commander of the Air Force MAJCOM for active duty members within  that  command  detailed  to  a  unit  of  the  Air  National  Guard  not  in  federal service; detailed to an organization outside the Air Force for which the Secretary of the Air Force serves as the Executive Agent pursuant to Department of Defense Directives; or similar circumstances. 4.3.3.5.1.3.  The  Commander,  Air  Force  District  of  Washington  for  Air  Force Elements not within such commands, agencies or activities. 4.3.3.5.2.  In appropriate circumstances (such as a geographically dispersed Air Force Element),  an  Air  Force  Element  may  be  divided  into  sections  and  an  Air  Force Element section commander appointed to each section.  In these cases, the Air Force Element commander designates which members are attached to each section. 4.4.  Office  Symbol  Codes.  Office  Symbol  Codes  (OSCs)  identify  the  organization  structure and  functional  responsibilities  within  a  unit.    For  instance,  “HO”  is  the  OSC  for  the  History Office in  the wing headquarters.   The following specifically  addresses  OSCs as used in  MPES and  related  manpower  documentation.    (Note:    Office  Symbol  Codes  were  formerly  called Organization Structure Codes.) 4.4.1.  General Characteristics of OSCs. 4.4.1.1.  Major  functions  have  two-letter  symbols,  e.g.,  surgeon--SG.    Since  basic functions report to major functions, basic functions have three-letter (or more) symbols, e.g.,  dental--SGD.    A  basic  function’s  office  symbol  starts  with  the  same  letters  as  the parent function’s office symbol, and adds one more letter. 4.4.1.2.  Each major function within the Air Force is assigned a two-letter office symbol; wing staff, group, and squadrons within the operations group and mission support group have two-letter office symbols.  Basic functions are assigned three-letter (or more) office symbols.    Some  major  functions  include  basic  functions  that  are  similar  in  title  and function to another major function (e.g., the major function of manpower, personnel and services,  A1,  may  have  a  basic  function  of  plans).    Since  all  office  symbols  within  a function start with the same two letters, the personnel plans function should use the office symbol A1X rather than XP so the basic function is not confused with a major function. 4.4.1.3.  The  OSC  CC  may  be  used  for  organizational  commanders  instead  of  the functional  OSC.    MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  should  be  consistent  among  their  like-organizations in use of CC or the functional OSC in MPES. 4.4.1.4.  To  the  extent  possible,  OSCs  use  the  same  letters  and  titles  at  HQ  USAF, MAJCOM, and base-level. 4.4.1.5.  Types of OSCs.  There are two types of OSCs: 4.4.1.5.1.  Air Force Standard OSCs are available for use by more than one command.  These  types  of  OSCs  are  established  for  standard  organization  structures  such  as those  in  Chapter  3  of  this  AFI  or  a  functional  AFI  and  to  promote  standardization and ease of communication.  These OSCs are identified by a command code of “HQ” in the MPES OSC Reference Table. 74 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 4.4.1.5.2.  Command-unique OSCs are used by a single command, as identified in the MPES  OSC  Reference  Table.    Command-unique  OSCs  cannot  duplicate  or  conflict with standard OSCs.  Do not create a command-unique OSC if an Air Force standard OSC exists for an organization; e.g., if a Civil Engineer Squadron has an Operations Flight, it uses an OSC of CEO as reflected in Chapter 3. 4.4.2.  Procedures for MPES OSCs: 4.4.2.1.  MPES  OSCs  are  limited  to  7  alphanumeric  characters.    Though  special characters  such  as  dashes  or  slashes  may  be  acceptable  when  OSCs  are  used  for communication or identification purposes, they cannot be included in OSCs as reflected in MPES because they create problems in some data systems that interface with MPES. 4.4.2.2.  MPES OSC titles are limited to  40 characters  for Air Force systems  and a 100 character  title  for  interface  with  DoD  systems.    To  facilitate  interface  with  the  DoD systems,  the  100  character  title  should  be  spelled  out  as  much  as  possible,  avoiding acronyms and other abbreviations.  Special characters cannot be used in MPES OSC titles because they create problems in some data systems that interface with MPES. 4.4.2.3.  Organizational  level  should  not  normally  be  included  in  the  OSC  title;  i.e.,  do not include words like Division, Directorate, Squadron, Flight, Section, etc., in the title.  This allows the same OSC to be used at different organizational levels. 4.4.2.4.  Using organizations should request deletion of OSCs that are no longer required.  The deletions cannot occur until there are no longer any manpower authorizations using the OSC. 4.4.2.5.  Existing OSCs should be used when possible. 4.4.2.6.  HQ USAF functional managers should maintain standard OSCs/structures down to the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit OSCs) for MAJCOM and NAF headquarters to  facilitate communications and minimize personnel  transition  time.  The HQ USAF functional manager must approve all deviations to these established three-letter office symbols (see Paragraph 6.1.3). 4.4.2.7.  Do not use proposed OSCs until approved. 4.4.3.  A-Staff OSCs.  A-staff OSCs are used to identify certain major staff elements in HQ USAF, MAJCOM headquarters and C-NAF headquarters.  These OSCs are patterned on the J-staff  structure  used  in  joint  organizations  and  are  designed  to  improve  communication within the Air Force and with other DoD organizations.  Base-level organizations do not use A-Staff  OSCs.    Functions  not  covered  by  the  standardized  A-staff  structure  maintain  their current  office  symbols  (e.g.,  FM,  JA,  SG,  PA,  etc.).    Standard  2-letter  A-staff  OSCs  are shown in Figure 4.1.  MAJCOMs may request to link A-staff 2-digit functions (e.g., A3 and A5  as  A3/5)  in  their  MAJCOM  headquarters  using  the  organization  change  request procedures  in  Chapter  6.    MAJCOMs  are  authorized  to  approve  linking  A-staff  2-digit functions in their C-NAFs if they follow the guidance in Figure 3.2.  MAJCOMs may return to the standard A-staff structure in Figure 4.1. without using the organization change request procedures  in  Chapter  6  but  they  must  notify  AF/A1M  of  the  return  to  the  standard structure. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 75 Figure 4.1.  Standard 2-Letter A-Staff OSCs. A1 – Manpower, Personnel and Services A2 – Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance A3 – Operations A4 – Logistics, Engineering and Force Protection A5 – Plans and Requirements A6 – Communications A8 – Strategic Plans and Programs A9 – Studies, Analyses, Assessments and Lessons Learned A10 – Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration (Limited to HQ USAF and approved MAJCOM headquarters)  4.4.4.  Requests for MPES OSC Actions: 4.4.4.1.  If an OSC change is needed because of an Organization Change Request (OCR), requesters  include  the  associated  OSC  actions  in  question  5  of  the  OCR  per  the procedures in Chapter 6 of this AFI. 4.4.4.2.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  DRUs  and  SAF/AAR  send  other  OSC  requests  for  MPES actions  via  e-mail  to  the  AF/A1MO  Workflow  mailbox.    The  e-mail  should  have  a distinct  subject  reflecting  the  request  and  requester;  e.g.,  subject:    OSC  Request  -  ACC OS  Add;  OSC  Request  -  AFMC  PK  Actions.    The  e-mail  should  include:    the  specific OSC,  OSC  titles,  action  (add,  delete,  change),  a  short  rationale  for  the  request,  and whether  requesting  a  standard  or  command-unique  OSC  (identify  command  code,  as appropriate).    A  spreadsheet  request  template  is  available  from  AF/A1MO,  their  Air Force  Portal  site  or  SharePoint  site.    AF/A1MO  obtains  functional  coordination  within HQ USAF, as required, and forwards approved requests to be loaded into MPES.  Note:  OSC  requests  for  organizations  outside  the  Air  Force  (e.g.,  Air  Force  Elements)  should be sent to AF/A1MP instead of AF/A1MO. 76 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 5 PROCEDURES FOR NAMING AND NUMBERING UNITS 5.1.  Nomenclature.  Standardize  organization  titles,  when  possible.  When  activating  a  unit, designate it using the procedures in this Instruction and guidance in AFPD 38-1. 5.2.  General Guidelines.  Apply the following guidelines when naming a unit: 5.2.1.  Generally,  units  require  a  specific  organization  title  or  designation  made  up  of  a number  or  name,  a  "kind"  (nomenclature)  and  a  "type"  (organizational  level)  indicator. Examples of a numbered and named unit designations are in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1.  Unit Designation Examples. Numbered Unit Designation Example: Title: 2d Bomb Wing Number: 2 Unit Kind: Bomb Unit Type: Wing ------------------------------------------- Named Unit Designation Example: Title: Ogden Air Logistics Center Unit Kind: Ogden Air Logistics Unit Type: Center  5.3.  Unit Number: 5.3.1.  A numbered unit is assigned a number of no more than three numerals (for example, 305th Air Mobility Wing). 5.3.2.  USAF designates Numbered Air Forces in a single series beginning with "First."  Do not  use  Arabic  or  Roman  numerals  in  designating  Numbered  Air  Forces.    C-NAFs  have  a parenthetical  designation  indicating  their  component  role  consisting  of  "(Air  Forces XXXXX)"  where  "XXXXX"  is  the  functional  or  geographic  designation  of  the  associated Unified  Combatant  Command;  e.g.,  Eighteenth  Air  Force  (Air  Forces  Transportation)  or Seventh  Air  Force  (Air  Forces  Korea).    NAFs  that  are  not  C-NAFs  cannot  have  a parenthetical designation; e.g., Second Air Force. 5.3.3.  Use unit numbers as low in sequence as possible. 5.3.4.  Reserve numbers 101 through 299 for Air National Guard units. 5.3.5.  Do not duplicate wing and independent group numerical designations.  In other words, there  is  only  one  388th  wing  (presently  a  fighter  wing)  or  one  720th  group  (presently  a special tactics group). Since these numbers are taken, no other 388th or 720th wing or group is authorized.  AF/A1M manages active wing designations. 5.3.6.  Give  groups  and  support  squadrons  the  same  number  as  their  parent  organizations, when  possible.  If  you  cannot  give  groups  their  parent  organization's  number  (e.g.,  due  to duplication) do not use a number already assigned to another wing. Assign to these groups or AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 77 squadrons  a  number  that  bears  a  logical  relationship  to  the  parent.  When  feasible,  number duplicate  units  7XX  or  8XX  (where  XX  is  the  wing  number).  For  example,  duplicate squadrons under the 96th Civil Engineer Group would be the 96th Civil Engineer Squadron and 796th Civil Engineer Squadron. 5.3.7.  Do not normally give mission squadrons assigned to groups or wings the same number as  their  parent  organizations.  When  otherwise  convenient,  use  sequential  numbers  for mission  squadrons  within  the  same  wing.    Examples  of  mission  squadrons  include operational  squadrons in a flying wing, training  squadrons in  a training  wing,  and software maintenance squadrons in a maintenance wing. 5.3.8.  You may not normally redesignate a unit numerically.  For example, if the host wing at  a base changes, the support units are not  redesignated  from  the old  host wing number to the new host wing number.  Instead, the support units under the old host wing are inactivated and  support  units  with  the  new  host  wing  number  are  activated.    This  ensures  that  the previous host wing has like-numbered support units available for activation if needed. 5.3.9.  Normally number units subordinate to  a NAF 6XX (where XX is the NAF number).  Do not use 6XX numbers for units not assigned to XX NAF (where XX is the NAF number). 5.3.10.  Use  the  heritage  priorities  in  AFPD  38-1  to  assign  unit  numerical  designations  for wings, independent groups and operational squadrons. 5.4.  Unit Kind: 5.4.1.  Assign a unit nomenclature that describes its assigned mission.  Do not construct unit titles that restrict another unit with a like mission from using that nomenclature. 5.4.2.  Do  not  designate  composite  wings  or  composite  independent  groups  by  "kind" designation (for example, 3d Wing). 5.4.3.  Keep  unit  "kinds"  (nomenclature)  and  type  attributes  short  and  simple.  Use  more specific nomenclature at lower organizational levels, but keep the number of different titles to a minimum. 5.4.4.  Use  current,  approved  nomenclature  for  units.   For  available  unit  "kinds" (nomenclatures)  see  the  Organization  Kind  Code  Reference  Table  in  MPES.    Units  must have approval from AF/A1M for any deviations to approved nomenclature.  (T-1). 5.5.  Unit Type:  Use Chapter 2 of this Instruction to determine appropriate unit types. 5.6.  New  Nomenclature.  If  an  unusual  factor  such  as  a  special  mission  suggests  a  deviation from the standard organization nomenclature, a MAJCOM may request new nomenclature from AF/A1M.    Include  in  these  requests  the  proposed  nomenclature  (unit  kind),  type  (level), command  to  which  restricted  (if  any)  and  a  short  definition  of  the  mission  implied  by  the nomenclature. Also include the justification or rationale for the proposed nomenclature.  Include this  information  in  question  5a  of  an  Organization  Change  Request  IAW  the  procedures  in Chapter 6 of this Instruction.  For example: Proposed Unit Kind: Fighter Training Proposed Unit Type: Squadron Command Restriction: None. Definition: Provides flying training in fighter type aircraft. 78 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Justification: Provide rationale for new nomenclature. 5.7.  Procedures  for  Unit  Designation:  Units  are  regularly  activated, inactivated,  or redesignated as a result of force structure and organizational changes.  Designation actions will conform to policy criteria in AFPD 38-1 and procedural criteria documented in this Instruction. (T-1). 5.7.1.  Do  not  designate  or  redesignate  a  unit  with  the  exact  number,  name  and  type  of another active or inactive unit. 5.7.2.  When a new unit is needed, you may re-activate an inactive unit of the same number or  name  and  similar  function.    It  may  be  redesignated  before  activation  to  reflect  current nomenclature when needed.  The unit that is activated again keeps its lineage, honors, history and  emblem.    When  proposing  a  unit  activation,  MAJCOMs  should  contact  the  Air  Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA) as early in the process as possible for identification of appropriate  inactive  units  that  are  available.    “Similar  function”  for  inactive  flying  units means  re-activation  as  a  unit  whose  members  operate  aircraft,  spacecraft  or  other  flying equipment  operating  in  the  air  or  space  environments.    Other  types  of  mission  units  and support units do not use the heritage of former flying units. 5.7.3.  A unit retains its lineage, honors and history through all activations, inactivations and redesignations.  AFI 84-101, Historical Products, Services, and Requirements, describes the effect  an  organizational  action  has  on  inheriting  the  lineage,  honors  and  history  of  a  unit.  Upon request, the Air Force Historical Research Agency provides MAJCOMs with a list of qualified inactive units for possible activation. 5.7.4.  MAJCOMs  will  use  approved  nomenclature  and  heritage  lists  to  propose  unit designations.    Submit  these  proposals  to  AF/A1M  for  evaluation  and  certification  of compliance  with  guidance  in  AFPD  38-1  and  this  Instruction  according  to  procedures  in Chapter  6.    If  MAJCOMs  wish  to  deviate  from  the  guidance,  they  must  provide  explicit justification  in  a  request  for  approval  of  an  organizational  variance.    AF/A1M  sends proposals to the Chief of Staff for approval. 5.7.5.  Requests to memorialize a named unit or named activity are to follow the guidelines in  AFI  36-3108,  Memorialization  Program  and  Ceremonies.    MAJCOMs  submit  these requests according to the procedures in Chapter 6 of AFI 38-101 and include a biography of the individual, explanation of why the MAJCOM wishes to memorialize the organization for this individual, and certification that appropriate quality force reviews or background checks have been conducted. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 79 Chapter 6 ORGANIZATION CHANGES 6.1.  Actions  Requiring  AF/A1M  Approval.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  and  their subordinate  units  (through  their  Manpower,  Organization  and  Resources  office)  must  have AF/A1M approval to: 6.1.1.  Activate,  inactivate,  or  redesignate  a  unit  or  to  vary  from  any  policy,  guidance, procedure, or standard organization depicted in this Instruction or AFPD 38-1.  A variation includes any addition, deletion, or merger of functions shown in a standard organization. (T-1).    AF/A1M  staffs  these  requests  to  appropriate  approval  authorities  within  HQ  USAF  as shown in Table 6.1. Table 6.1.  OCR Approval Levels for Actions Submitted to AF/A1M. ACTION APPROVAL LEVEL MAJCOM  Activations, redesignations, inactivations NAF Activations, redesignations, inactivations HQ USAF FOA or  DRU activations, redesignations and inactivations MAJCOM FOA or MAJCOM DRU Activations MAJCOM FOA Redesignations, inactivations Wing Activations, redesignations, inactivations Independent Groups Activations, redesignations, inactivations Dependent Groups Activations, redesignations, inactivations, variations Dependent Groups Nonstandard Nomenclature Operational Squadrons/Numbered Flights Activations, redesignations, inactivations Support Squadrons/Numbered Flights Activations, redesignations, inactivations, variances  Named Units (Centers) Activations, redesignations, inactivations Named Units (Other than Centers) Change to standard internal Squadron functional structure or name of internal Squadron functional flights  SECAF SECAF SECAF SECAF AF/CC or AF/CV AF/CC or AF/CV AF/CC or AF/CV AF/A1 AF/CC or AF/CV AF/A1 AF/A1MO or AF/A1M & Functional Manager  AF/CC or AF/CV AF/A1 AF/A1M & Functional Manager  6.1.2.  Change  major  staff  elements  (directorate  or  equivalent  level;  i.e.,  offices  with  two-digit office symbols) in a MAJCOM headquarters. 80 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 6.1.3.  Also,  HQ  USAF  functional  managers  must  approve  changes to  MAJCOM headquarters at the division or equivalent level (i.e., offices with three-digit office symbols).  MAJCOMs submit these requests to the appropriate HQ USAF functional manager with  an information copy to AF/A1MO or to AF/A1M via the procedures in this chapter. 6.2.  Organization  Change  Request  (OCR).  A  request  for  organization  action  such  as  unit activation, inactivation, redesignation, or variation to a standard structure should include answers to the following questions, as they apply. Answer “Not Applicable” when appropriate.  AF/A1M reviews  organization  change  requests  and,  upon  approval,  direct  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  DRUs  or SAF/AAR  to  reflect  the  action  in  the  RCS:    HAF-A8X(M)9227  Report,  Programming  Actions Involving  Units,  Installations,  and  Unit  Equipment  per  AFI  16-403.    Also,  MAJCOMs,  FOAs and  DRUs  are  required  by  AFI  84-105,  Organizational  Lineage,  Honors,  and  Heraldry,  to submit  to  the  Air  Force  Historical  Research  Agency  a  monthly  report  of  any  changes  in organizations  using  RCS:  HAF-HO(M)7401,  Air  Force  Organization  Status  Change  Report.  Implementation of actions should be in accordance with applicable provisions of AFI 10-503. 6.2.1.  Organization Change Request  Questions.  (MAJCOMs should edit submissions from their  base-level  organizations  before  forwarding  requests  to  HQ  USAF  to  ensure  questions are answered completely and that information extraneous to HQ USAF review is deleted.) 6.2.1.1.  Question  1:    What  is  the  proposed  action  (list  specific  actions,  such  as activation, inactivation, nomenclature change, reorganization, or variation request)? 6.2.1.2.  Question 2:  Why is the action needed? What are the expected benefits? (Identify factors driving the need for the action, e.g., changes to Instructions, missions or concepts of  operations;  attach  any  substantiating  Air  Force  directives.  In  describing  expected benefits,  identify  improvements,  examples  of  increased  mission  capability  and  so  on. Generalized  statements  such  as  increases  mission  capability  or  reduces  span  of  control are not adequate as justifications.) 6.2.1.3.  Question 3:  What is the structure of the new organization (include current and proposed  organization  and  function  charts  showing  authorized  and  proposed  manpower by  officer,  enlisted  and  civilian.    Also  include  Average  Daily  Student  Load,  where applicable.    Explain  manpower  changes.  To  assist  in  identification  of  potential Congressional  or  community  concerns,  identify  the  number  of  manpower  authorization changes for each affected installation in your response; use a table if needed.)? 6.2.1.4.  Question  4:    Explain  how  the  proposed  structure  compares  with  standard structure,  nomenclature  and  size  guidance  and  provide  rationale  for  any  requested deviations.  Using  the  guidance  in  Chapter  2,  include  computation  of  adjusted populations for wings, groups or squadrons with manpower authorizations under the unit size thresholds. 6.2.1.5.  Question 5:  As a result of this request, are any changes needed to add or delete Organization Nomenclature Codes or Office Symbol Codes (OSCs) or to change the title for an OSC; if so, provide the following information.  Strive to use existing codes rather than creating new ones.  Avoid special characters due to data system interface problems.  (See Chapter 4 for additional information on OSCs.) 6.2.1.5.1.  Question 5.a.  Organization Nomenclature Code Change: AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 81 Action:  [Add or Delete; titles cannot be changed] Title: 6.2.1.5.2.  Question 5.b.  OSC Change:   6.2.1.6.  Question  6:    For  unit  activations  or  redesignations,  explain  why  the  proposed unit  designation  was  chosen.    Identify  any  inactive  historical  units  you’re  proposing  to use  and  explain  why  you  want  to  use  these  units.  (Coordinate  proposals  with  the appropriate history office.) 6.2.1.7.  Question 7:    What  is  the cost  of the request  in  terms of dollars and resources? (Document cost in terms of dollars and manpower.  Include administrative costs such as flags and signs, as well as manpower increases or monetary costs directly driven by the requested reorganization action.  Do not include costs that may be a result of related force structure, for example, runway construction costs for bedding down programmed aircraft would not be included in the OCR to activate an associated flying squadron. If the action cannot  be  implemented  from  within  currently  programmed  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU resources, see paragraph immediately below.) 6.2.1.7.1.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and DRUs normally implement actions approved under the OCR process using currently programmed manpower and budgetary resources. In the  rare  cases  when  this  is  not  possible,  they  submit  an  initiative  for  the  resources needed  to  the  Air  Force  Corporate  Structure  during  a  budget  exercise,  following guidance in AFI 16-501, Control and Documentation of Air Force Programs, and any related  instructions.  This  is  done  prior  to  or  concurrent  with  the  OCR  submission. AF/A1M will hold the OCR without action until the resources are approved. AF/A1M will return the OCR with-out action if the resource approval does not occur within 30 calendar  days  of  receipt  of  the  OCR.  For  reconsideration,  the  MAJCOM,  FOA  or DRU resubmits the OCR following approval of the resources. 6.2.1.8.  Question  8:    Provide  a  mission  directive,  statement  or  description  for organizations being activated, inactivated, redesignated or reorganized. 6.2.1.9.  MAJCOM, FOA, and DRU A1Ms and SAF/AARM (for serviced organizations) submit  OCRs  requiring  AF/A1M  action  per  Paragraphs  6.1.1-2  using  a  request  memo 82 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 from the A1M or SAF/AARM to AF/A1MO.  These submissions reflect their commands’ position  and  are  to  have  been  staffed  with  appropriate  offices  internal  to  the  command (including  affected  command  functional  points  of  contact)  prior  to  submission  to  HQ USAF.  AF/A1MO coordinates the OCRs with appropriate HQ USAF offices and staffs the OCR to the approval authorities reflected in Table 6.1 for a decision on approval or disapproval. 6.2.1.9.1.  If  approval  authority  is  the  VCSAF,  CSAF  or  SECAF,  the  submitting MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU includes documentation reflecting approval  to  release the OCR  by  their  commander,  director,  vice  commander  or  equivalent.    A  copy  of  the command  staff  summary  sheet  for  the  action  is  the  preferred  documentation  and  is included as an attachment to the OCR submission memo. 6.2.1.9.2.  OCRs  for  AFRC  and  ANG  units  include  coordination  by  the  Gaining Commands  for  the  affected  units.    HQ  AFRC/A1M  and  NGB/A1M  obtain  the coordination  from  the  Gaining  Command  A1Ms  who  staff  the  requests  within  their command,  including  appropriate  functional  coordination.    The  Gaining  Command A1Ms obtain coordination from their commander or vice commander if the approval authority  for  the  action  per  Table  6.1  is  the  VCSAF,  CSAF  or  SECAF.    The MAJCOM  commander  or  vice  commander  may  delegate  the  coordination  of  these OCRs to the command A1M; the command A1M provides a copy of the delegation to AF/A1MO, HQAFRC/A1M and NGB/A1M and updates the delegation at least every five  years.    (Note:    See  AFPD  10-3,  Air  Reserve  Component  Forces;  AFI  10-301, Responsibilities  of  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC)  Forces;  and  AFI  90-1001, Responsibilities  for  Total  Force  Integration,  for  further  discussion  of  Gaining Commands.  This term is under review for AFRC units.  If guidance is subsequently modified  to  change  the  Gaining  Command  term  for  AFRC  units,  the  same responsibilities will apply to organizations with the revised term; however, if AFI 10-301  guidance  directing  Gaining  Command  review  of  organizational  structure  is eliminated  as  it  applies  to  AFRC,  the  corresponding  requirement  for  Gaining Command  coordination  of  AFRC  OCRs  in  this  paragraph  of  AFI  38-101  will  no longer be required.) 6.2.1.9.3.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  DRUs  and  SAF/AARM  are  encouraged  to  use supplements  to  this  AFI  or  similar  documents  to  provide  guidance  to  their organizations on OCRs that do not require HQ USAF approval, as well as command-unique organization structures, terms and processes. 6.2.1.9.4.  Figure  6.1  is  a  checklist  of  tips  for  preparing  an  OCR.    This  is  not  all-inclusive  and  supplements  the  questions  in  Paragraphs  6.9.1.1-8  above.    Following these  tips  helps  reduce  staffing  delays  that  occur  when  additional  information  or corrections need to be requested.   AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 83 Figure 6.1. OCR Preparation Tips (use with questions in paragraphs 6.9.1.1-8).  6.2.2.  A request for organization action is not required in the following instances: 6.2.2.1.  For units inactivating as a result of an approved force structure action.  Actions subject  to  legislative  action  or  related  studies  are  not  considered  approved  until satisfactory completion of the legislative requirements.  If actions are not in accordance with heritage priority guidance in AFPD 38-1, an OCR is required. 6.2.2.2.  When  organizational  impacts  have  been  addressed  as  part  of  actions  approved under  AFI  38-203,  Commercial  Activities  Program  (see  that  publication  for  specific guidance on required information). 6.2.2.3.  When specific unit actions are directed in a Program Action Directive, Program Guidance Letter, Program Change Request, or similar directive issued by HQ USAF. 6.2.3.  A  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU,  after  notifying  AF/A1M,  may  return  a  changed organization to a prescribed configuration. 84 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 6.2.4.  Additional requirements may need to be met for establishment of a new FOA, DRU, MAJCOM  FOA,  or  MAJCOM  DRU.    The  annual  Defense  Appropriations  Act  usually contains a provision prohibiting expenditure of funds for establishment of such organizations.  The provision permits the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) to  grant a waiver if SECAF certifies  to  Congress  that  the  establishment  results  in  personnel  or  financial  savings  to  the Department of the Air Force.  Existing FOAs, DRUs, MAJCOM FOAs and MAJCOM DRUs will not be redesignated or re-missioned to an unrelated mission area to circumvent this legal direction.  (T-1). the  current  guidance  when  considering establishment of one of these organizations.   Contact  AF/A1MO  for 6.2.5.  Units  will  not  take  actions  such  as  scheduling  ceremonies,  inviting  dignitaries,  or making  public  announcements  prior  to  appropriate  HQ  USAF  approval  of  organization changes. (T-1). 6.2.6.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  ensure  all  notification  requirements  are  followed  for organization actions.  Consult current guidance including CJCSI 2300.02H, Coordination of Overseas  Force  Structure  Changes  (OFSC)  and  Host-Nation  Notification;  AFI  10-503, Strategic  Basing;  AFI  10-504,  OFSC  and  Host  Nation  Notification;  AFI  16-601, Implementation  of,  and Compliance  with,  International  Arms Control  and  Nonproliferation Agreements;  and  current  Congressional  notification/public  announcement  requirements  (as applicable).    Take  these  requirements  into  account  when  planning  implementation  timing.  For instance, the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty requires the U.S. make notifications on affected organization changes 42 days in advance of the implementation date and additional time needs to be allowed for processing the notification through EUCOM, the Joint  Staff,  and  the  State  Department  after  OCR  approval.    (Note:    MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and DRUs work CFE notifications with HQ USAFE per guidance in AFI 16-601.) 6.2.7.  MAJCOMs, FOAs and  DRUs also  use the Organization Change Request  procedures for  reassignment  of  units  or  named  activities  to  another  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU.    The losing  command  normally  prepares  the  OCR.    If  agreed  to  by  both  parties,  the  gaining command may prepare the OCR or the commands may submit a joint OCR.  In all cases, the submitting command must coordinate the OCR with the other command prior to submission and include this coordination with their OCR submittal to AF/A1M. (T-1). 6.3.  Testing  New  Organizations.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  may  develop  and  test  new organizations.  The  purpose  of  an  organization  test  is  to  evaluate  the  new  organization's effectiveness  under  actual  working  conditions  and  resolve  most  common  problems  before committing affected functions to change. A test involving an organization structure found in this Instruction requires AF/A1M approval. Submit test plans for approval at least 120 calendar days before the proposed start of the test. The test plan should include: 6.3.1.  Answers to the questions in Paragraph 6.2.1., as they apply. 6.3.2.  Dates of the test period (not to exceed 1 year). 6.3.3.  Objective measures to assist in evaluation of the test. 6.3.4.  After  completing  the  test  period,  the  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU  sends  results  and recommendations  to  AF/A1M.  A  waiver  request  is  included  if  a  permanent  organization change is desired. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 85 Chapter 7 ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTATION 7.1.  Implementation  Authority.  HQ  USAF,  MAJCOM,  FOA  and  DRU  manpower  and organization  functions  are  responsible  for  publishing  the  legal  and  authoritative  documents needed to implement organization actions. 7.1.1.  Department  of  the  Air  Force  (DAF/A1M)  Letters.  DAF/A1M  letters  constitute, reconstitute,  disband,  consolidate,  activate,  inactivate,  redesignate,  assign  and  reassign (between  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs)  Air  Force  units.    In  addition,  DAF/A1M  letters designate,  redesignate,  inactivate,  assign  and  reassign  (between  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and DRUs) named activities.  DAF/A1M letters serve as authority for MAJCOM, FOA and DRU unit and named activity  organization actions. DAF/A1M letters  follow the formats outlined in Figure 7.1. through Figure 7.5. 7.1.1.1.  Effective Date. The effective date of an organization action is either published in the  DAF/A1M  letter  or  in  the  order  issued  by  a  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU.  When  a DAF/A1M  letter  allows  the  effective  date  to  be  on  or  about  a  certain  date,  the organization action must occur no more than 30  calendar days before or  after that date. (T-1). 7.1.1.1.1.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  DRUs  and  SAF/AARM  notify  HQ  USAF/A1MO  of their desired effective dates by providing HQ USAF/A1MO a courtesy copy of their RCS:    HAF-A8X(M)9227  Reports  submitted  in  accordance  with  AFI  16-403.    The desired effective dates should be projected a minimum of two months in advance but no less than one day in advance. 7.1.1.1.2.  An on or about date in a DAF/A1M letter is at least 30 calendar days from the  date  of  the  letter.    This  provides  the  maximum  flexibility  for  commands submitting  their  desired  effective  dates  with  less  than  a  month’s  notice  while preventing  the  final  effective  dates  from  being  earlier  than  the  date  the  DAF/A1M letter is issued. 7.1.1.1.3.  If  a  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DRU  or  SAF/AARM  needs  to  change  an  effective date outside the dates allowed by a DAF/A1M letter on or about date, it submits the new  desired  date  and  reason  for  the  change  in  an  amendment  to  its  RCS:    HAF-A8X(M)9227 Report using the instructions in AFI 16-403.  This amendment should be submitted before the last day within the on or about period for DAF/A1M letters with on or about dates or before the effective date if the original DAF/A1M letter did not have an on or about date. 7.1.1.1.4.  If  a  DAF/A1M  letter  allows  an  effective  date  to  be  on  or  about  a  certain date  and  the  MAJCOM,  FOA,  DRU  or  SAF/AARM  fails  to  issue  a  special  order providing the final date within the on or about period, then the on or about date in the DAF/A1M letter becomes the final effective date. 7.1.1.1.5.  DAF/A1M  letters  activating,  inactivating,  redesignating  or  changing  the status  of  MAJCOMs,  FOAs  and  DRUs  provide  a  specific  effective  date  and  do  not 86 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 have  on  or  about  dates.    This  is  because  these  types  of  organizations  are  directly subordinate to HQ USAF, which is the issuing authority for DAF/A1M letters. 7.1.2.  G-Series Orders. These orders are published to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign and reassign units, detachments and named activities subordinate to a HQ USAF, MAJCOM, FOA,  or  DRU;  and  to  attach  one  organization  to  another.  A  MAJCOM,  FOA,  or  DRU manpower and organization function may authenticate and publish G-Series Orders using the formats in Figure 7.6 through Figure 7.12.  SAF/AAR may perform these functions for their supported  organizations.    In  addition,  AFI  33-328,  Administrative  Orders,  provides  general guidelines  about  orders  preparation.    ANG  units  follow  additional  guidance  in  ANG Supplement  to  AFI  33-328.    (Note:  Unit  moves  and  movement  orders  are  covered  by  AFI 16-403.) 7.1.2.1.  Guidelines for G-Series Orders: 7.1.2.1.1.  Numbering  G-Series  Orders.  Orders  are  numbered  in  sequence  starting with  number one (for example, GS-1, GS-2 and so on). Begin  a new sequence each fiscal year. 7.1.2.1.2.  Effective Date. The effective date of the action described in the order is the date of the order, unless a different effective date is specified. 7.1.2.1.3.  Distribution. Send all organizations impacted by the order a copy.  Use of standard  distribution  lists  is  encouraged.  Orders  involving  medical  units  include  the Air Force Medical Support Agency on distribution.  All orders (and DAF letters) are sent  to  AFHRA  (address  AFHRA/RSO,  600  Chennault  Circle,  Maxwell  AFB,  AL 36112-6424 or e-mail:  afhra.rs@us.af.mil). 7.1.2.2.  G-Series Order Organization Actions: 7.1.2.2.1.  Activation  and  Assignment.  Include  the  title  of  organization,  station,  unit or establishment of assignment, effective date and authority (Figures 7.6. and 7.9.). 7.1.2.2.2.  Redesignation. Include the old and new unit or detachment designation; the station,  unit  and  establishment  of  assignment,  as  applicable;  the  effective  date;  and the authority (Figures 7.7. and 7.9.). (See Paragraph 4.3.3.1.4. for additional guidance regarding redesignation of detachments.) 7.1.2.2.3.  Inactivation. Include the designation of organization being inactivated, the station, the effective date, the disposition of personnel and equipment, statement that funds  are  to  be  disposed  of  according  to  Air  Force  directives  and  the  authority (Figures 7.8. and 7.9.). 7.1.2.2.4.  Reassignment. Include the designation of the establishment from which the unit is relieved, the establishment to which the unit is assigned, the effective date of transfer and the authority (Figures 7.9. through 7.11.). 7.1.2.2.5.  Attachment  of  One  Unit  to  Another.  Include  the  unit  and  MAJCOM  to which  attached,  the  effective  date  of  attachment,  the  purpose  of  attachment  and  the authority (See sample orders in Chapter 8). 7.1.2.2.6.  Detachments  and  Operating  Locations.    (See  Figure  7.12.)  Detachments and  operating  locations  are  designated  as  part  of  a  unit,  not  an  establishment,  e.g., AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 87 Detachment  1,  1st  Fighter  Squadron  or  Operating  Location  A,  HQ  1st  Operations Group.  This  is  because  detachments and operating locations are parts of a unit, not separate units.  Special orders are not required for Operating Location actions because there is no associated UCMJ authority; however, MAJCOMs may publish orders for announcement or accountability purposes. 7.2.  Distribution  Requirements  .  Each  MAJCOM  manpower  and  organization  function ensures  HQ  USAF/A1MO  is  on  distribution  to  receive  special  orders,  MAJCOM  organization charts, mission directives and Instructions relating to organizations within their command. 7.3.  Headquarters  Department  of  the  Air  Force  Organization  Chart.  This  publication prescribes  AFVA  38-104,  HQ  USAF  Organization  Chart.  AFVA  38-104  shows  HQ  USAF offices  under  the  Secretariat  and  the  Air  Staff  down  to  the  3-letter  level,  along  with  their respective Field Operating Agencies (FOAs). SAF/AAR prepares this AFVA semiannually or as needed. 88 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Figure 7.1.

A  provisional  unit  is  temporary  in  nature  and  created  when  a  specific organization  is  required  for  a  temporary  mission  and  no  organization  exists  to  attach  forces (including personnel).  All personnel are attached to the provisional unit and remain assigned to their permanent unit. 8.1.1.  References  to  assigned  and  attached  units  in  this  chapter  refer  to  the  organizational structure of the provisional organization which establishes the Air Force chain of command.  Assigned and attached units should not be confused with assigned and attached forces. 8.1.2.  Provisional  units  are  organized  in  the  same  manner  as  permanent  units.    Establish provisional  organizations  at  the  organization  level  required  to  meet  mission  requirements (i.e.,  NAF,  wing,  group,  squadron,  flight,  detachment,  operating  location).    Organize provisional  operations,  maintenance,  mission  support,  medical  groups,  and  subordinate squadrons under a provisional wing, as needed.  Related functions may be consolidated into a single  unit  if  more  efficient  due  to  size,  oversight,  or  other  factors;  e.g.,  all  maintenance functions can be combined into a maintenance squadron when the size of the functions do not warrant  separate  maintenance,  aircraft  maintenance  and  maintenance  operations  squadrons.  If  only  a  portion  of  a  squadron  is  required,  those  functions  may  be  added  to  an  existing provisional  squadron  or  to  the  next  higher  provisional  unit.    For  example,  if  an  entire expeditionary  force  support  squadron  is  not  required,  manpower,  personnel,  and  services functions could be assigned into an expeditionary mission support group. 8.1.3.  A provisional unit is attached rather than assigned to a permanent unit.  Conversely, a permanent  unit  cannot  be  assigned  to  a  provisional  unit,  but  it  may  be  attached  to  a provisional unit.  A subordinate provisional unit is assigned to a higher provisional unit. 8.2.  Types  of  provisional  units.  There  are  two  types  of  provisional  units  (traditional  and expeditionary). 8.2.1.  Traditional.  When there is a need for a temporary organization not associated with a contingency  type  situation.    An  organization  change  request  (OCR)  to  HQ  USAF  or Department of the Air Force (DAF) letter is not required for this type of provisional unit.  For example, 8.2.1.1.  When two or more organizations merge and the need exists to create a temporary organization pending final disposition of resources from the merging organizations. 8.2.1.2.  When an organization is needed for short-term requirement such as a temporary headquarters  until  a  location  is  selected  for  the  permanent  headquarters.    (Note:  A provisional unit should not be established to pre-suppose approval of a permanent basing decision.) 8.2.2.  Expeditionary.    Provisional  organizations  established  in  support  of  a  contingency  or exercise  operation.    There  are  two  types  of  expeditionary  units  (major  force  provider  and rainbow).    (Note:    Additional  guidance  for  use  of  provisional  units  during  contingency 100 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 operations is  provided in AFI 38-205, Expeditionary Manpower Management, and AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution.) 8.2.2.1.  Major Force Provider.  An expeditionary unit that draws the preponderance of its forces  or  command  element  from  a  single  active  unit.    This  wartime  or  contingency organization uses the unit designation of the unit providing the preponderance of forces (major force provider) or the command element.  (Discussed further in 8.7.3.1.) 8.2.2.2.  Rainbow.    An  expeditionary  unit  formed  from  multiple  force  providers.    This wartime or contingency organization does not have an identifiable major force provider.  These  organizations  are  inactive  historical  units  converted  to  provisional  status  and assigned  to,  and  activated  by  MAJCOMs  as  expeditionary  organizations.    (Discussed further in 8.7.3.2.) 8.2.2.3.  MAJCOM  A1Ms  will  establish  procedures  for  requesting  the  establishment  of expeditionary units assigned or attached to subordinate AETFs. 8.2.3.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  and  DRUs  will  forward  copies  of  G-series  orders  to  AF/A1MO, AFHRA (address AFHRA/RSO, 600 Chennault Circle, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6424 or e-mail:    afhra.rs@us.af.mil),  all  units  mentioned  in  the  order,  and  other  offices  and  units  as needed.  (Discussed further in 8.11.)  (T-1). 8.3.  PAS  Codes  .    Provisional  units  have  the  same  command  relationship  characteristics  and PAS  code  requirements  as  permanent  units.    MAJCOMs  request  provisional  PAS  codes  per current instructions.  PAS codes are assigned and registered in the PAS system.  The PAS code for provisional units is represented by an "H" in the fifth digit of the eight digit PAS instead of an  "F"  (i.e.,  "EP2CHR9C"  vs.  "EP2CFR9C").    The  use  of  "H"  serves  two  primary  purposes:  provides distinction between provisional units and regular units; and keeps the provisional PAS code compatible with the joint reporting systems. 8.4.  History  . 8.4.1.  Traditional  provisional  organizations  as  described  in  8.2.1.  are  temporary  and  once inactivated,  their  lineage  ceases  and  may  not  be  revived.    Any  provisional  unit  of  this  type using the same nomenclature as a previous provisional or permanent unit may not claim the lineage, history, or honors of that unit. 8.4.2.  Major  force  provider  expeditionary  organizations  as  described  in  Paragraph  8.2.2.1. are  temporary  and  once  inactivated,  their  lineage  ceases  and  may  not  be  revived;  however, any honors earned by this type of expeditionary provisional organization are conferred upon its single major force provider of the same organizational level (squadron to squadron; group to  group,  etc.)  in  accordance  with  AFI  84-105,  Organizational  Lineage,  Honors,  and Heraldry.  For this purpose, wings are considered on the same organizational level as groups and squadrons on the same organizational level as numbered flights. 8.4.3.  Rainbow  expeditionary  organizations  temporarily  converted  from  permanent  to provisional organizations as described in 8.2.2.2. retain all lineage, history, and honors of the permanent unit and, when returned to permanent status, retain all lineage, history, and honors earned  while  in  provisional  status.    Honors  earned  by  a  rainbow  unit  are  retained  by  the rainbow  unit  and  are  not  shared  with  units  that  provided  personnel  for  the  expeditionary organization. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 101 8.4.4.  For  specifics  on  lineage,  honors,  and  heraldry  refer  to  AFI  84-105,  Organizational Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry. 8.5.  Designations.  MAJCOMs will title provisional units to reflect their functional mission.  To the maximum  extent possible, use existing nomenclature.  Traditional provisional  units include the  term  provisional  in  the  unit  designation  to  indicate  the  unit  is  provisional,  for  example, Headquarters  849th  Mission  Support  Group  (Provisional)  or  HQ  849  MSG  (P).    MAJCOMs must  submit  an  organization  change  request  to  AF/A1M  IAW  Chapter  5  of  this  AFI  for approval to create new unit nomenclatures (organization kind). 8.5.1.  For  traditional  provisional  units,  MAJCOMs  should  select  a  unit  designation  that cannot  be  confused  with  another  unit  and  does  not  have  the  same  designation  as  an  active unit. 8.5.2.  Designate expeditionary units as directed in Paragraph 8.7. and Figure 8-1. 8.6.  Air  Expeditionary  Task  Force  (AETF).  An  AETF  may  be  established  as  an  Air  Force service component to a joint task force (JTF), or as a subordinate task force within a larger Air Force service component to address specific internal tasks.  If an AETF is formed as the former, the  AETF  commander  is  also  a  commander,  Air  Force  forces  (COMAFFOR).    Otherwise,  the AETF  commander  is  not  a  COMAFFOR,  but  reports  to  a  COMAFFOR.    An  AETF  has  a commander,  a  staff,  appropriate  command  and  control  mechanisms,  and  tailored  and  fully supported forces to meet specific mission requirements.  The AETF is organized into a numbered expeditionary  air  force  (NEAF),  air  expeditionary  wings  (AEW),  air  expeditionary  groups (AEG),  and air  expeditionary squadrons  (AES), or other organizations, as necessary to  provide reasonable spans of control.  When directly supporting a unified combatant command, the AETF is  attached  to  the  Air  Force  component.    When  an  AETF  is  established  to  support  a  joint  task force subordinate to a unified combatant command, the AETF may be attached for administrative control  directly  to  the  Air  Force  component  to  the  unified  combatant  command,  or  it  may  be assigned to an AETF established at the unified combatant command level. 8.6.1.  An AETF is named based on the unit providing the senior command headquarters, its size (NEAF, AEW, AEG), and the operation name. 8.6.1.1.  For  a  NEAF  level  AETF,  use  the  numerical  designation  of  the  engaged  NAF, followed  by  Expeditionary  Air  Force  (EAF),  then  the  name  of  the  operation.    For example,  a  NEAF-sized  AETF  established  under  12AF  (AFSOUTH)  would  be designated as 12 EAF-OPERATION NAME. 8.6.1.2.  In  rare  circumstances,  a  provisional  command  headquarters  may  be  needed between a NEAF and its assigned and attached forces.  These headquarters are designated as  a  numbered  Air  Expeditionary  Task  Force  followed  by  an  operation  or  location identifier,  for  example,  9th  Air  Expeditionary  Task  Force–Iraq  (9  AETF-I).    The  9 AETF-I would be assigned to the 9th Expeditionary Air Force (9 EAF). 8.6.1.3.  For wing- or group-sized AETFs, use the numerical designation of the engaged wing or group, followed by Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Air Expeditionary Group (AEG),  then  the  name  of  the  operation.  For  example,  a  wing  or  group-sized  AETF established under 12AF (AFSOUTH) would be designated the 345 AEW-OPERATION NAME or the 345 AEG-OPERATION NAME. 102 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 8.6.1.4.  While  not  normally  established,  a  squadron  sized  AETF  would  use  the designation of the engaged expeditionary squadron followed by the operation name. 8.6.2.  Refer  to  appropriate  Air  Force  and  Joint  doctrine  for  additional  guidance  on organization and command relationships. 8.7.  Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Organization: 8.7.1.  Expeditionary  units  are  established  to  operate  with  an  AETF.    In  the  following paragraphs,  the  term  “supported  command”  refers  to  the  Air  Force  MAJCOM  the  AF component  command  is  administratively  assigned  to  and  which  is  receiving  support  (i.e., forces) from other MAJCOMs.  “Supporting command” refers to  the Air Force MAJCOM, FOA or DRU providing forces to the supported command. 8.7.2.  Permanent  units  supporting  or  participating  in  an  AETF  from  their  permanent locations  are  not  redesignated  as  expeditionary  units  nor  are  major  force  provider expeditionary units established at the same location as the corresponding permanent unit.  In-place  permanent  units  supporting  or  participating  in  an  AETF  can  be  attached  to  the expeditionary unit they are supporting. 8.7.3.  Expeditionary  units  are  numbered  as  follows.    See  also  Figure  8-1  for  detailed guidelines on AEF unit naming and numbering. 8.7.3.1.  With the exception of support units, the numerical designation for expeditionary units that have a major force provider reflects the designation of the unit that provides the preponderance of forces or the command element to the expeditionary organization.  For example,  if  the  4th  Fighter  Wing  is  the  major  force  provider  of  an  Air  Expeditionary Wing, then the nomenclature would be 4th Expeditionary Fighter Wing (EFW).  If there is  a  mix  of  forces  (e.g.,  fighter,  mobility)  then  the  nomenclature  would  be  the  4  AEW.  The  organizational  level  of  the  expeditionary  unit  is  the  same  as  the  unit  providing  the preponderance of forces, except for the situations in Paragraphs 8.7.3.1.1.and 8.7.3.1.2. 8.7.3.1.1.  If size and scope of an operation do not warrant establishment of a wing, a group nomenclature may be used.  For example, if the 4th Fighter Wing is the major force  provider  of  an  Air  Expeditionary  activity  that  does  not  have  the  appropriate scope or size to be designated a wing, a major force provider unit designated the 4th Expeditionary Fighter Group or 4th Air Expeditionary Group could be established. 8.7.3.1.2.  If  the  size  and  scope  of  an  operation  do  not  warrant  establishment  of  a squadron, a numbered flight nomenclature may be used.  For example, if the 4th Civil Engineer Squadron is the major force provider for an expeditionary mission, but size does not  warrant  a squadron designation, a major force provider unit designated 4th Expeditionary Civil Engineer Flight could be established. 8.7.3.2.  The numerical designation for expeditionary units that do not have a major force provider reflects the designation of an historic unit activated to form a rainbow unit.  In cases where multiple MAJCOMs deploy forces to the same location, but  a single major force  provider  cannot  be  identified,  the  supported  MAJCOM  will  create  expeditionary units  using  historical  “rainbow”  units  allocated  for  their  use  by  AF/A1MO.    The numerical designation for expeditionary rainbow units retains the numerical designation of  the  historic  unit  converted  from  permanent  to  provisional  status.    MAJCOMs  must AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 103 work  with  their  historians  and  the  Air  Force  Historical  Research  Agency  to  identify inactivated units to fill rainbow expeditionary unit requirements to meet highest projected demand and provide those units to AF/A1MO.  AF/A1MO will issue a Department of the Air  Force  (DAF)  numbered  letter  converting  the  inactive  historic  units  to  provisional units  and  assigning  them  to  the  MAJCOM  to  activate  or  inactivate  in  provisional  unit status as needed (Figure 8-2). 8.7.3.3.  All  subordinate  dependent  groups  and  support  units  carry  the  same  numerical designation  as  the  parent  expeditionary  organization.    For  example,  support  units  under the  4th  Expeditionary  Fighter  Wing  would  be  designated  the  4th  Expeditionary Operations  Group,  4th  Expeditionary  Maintenance  Group,  4th  Expeditionary Maintenance  Squadron,  4th  Expeditionary  Mission  Support  Group,  4th  Expeditionary Logistics Readiness Squadron, 4th Expeditionary Medical Group. 8.7.3.4.  If portions of an organization are deployed to different locations, MAJCOMs are authorized to include the name of the operation and location in the unit designation (e.g., 71st Expeditionary Fighter Squadron – Noble Anvil, Location Name). Figure 8.1.  Expeditionary Unit Naming & Numbering Guidelines. Title Purpose xx Air Expeditionary Task Force (AETF).  Can be a NEAF, wing, group or squadron level.  The generic name of an Air Force Service component presented to a joint task force commander.  An AETF should be presented within the framework described in Air Force doctrine.    xx AETF- Operation Name or Location Identifier.  Provisional command headquarters between a NEAF and its assigned and attached forces.   Temporary wing assigned to an AETF.  xx Air Expeditionary Wing (AEW) or Expeditionary [mission-kind] Wing, e.g. Expeditionary Fighter Wing (EFW). Comments & Examples Use the numerical designation of the tasked NAF, wing, group or squadron followed by the operation name (e.g., 12 EAF-OPERATION NAME, 4 AEW-OPERATION NAME, 4 AEG-OPERATION NAME, 336 EAS-OPERATION NAME).  An in-place NAF retains its NAF designation (e.g., 7 AF (AFKOR)). Use the numerical designation of the parent NEAF followed by the operation name or location (e.g. 9 AETF-Iraq). Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate (e.g., 345 AEW, 4 EFW) 104 xx Air Expeditionary Group (AEG) xx Expeditionary [functional-kind] Group  xx Expeditionary [mission-kind] Squadron Temporary independent group assigned to an AETF.  An independent group has the same functions and responsibilities as a like-type wing, but its scope and size do not warrant wing-level designation.   Temporary group assigned to an AETF.    A dependent group is a mission, maintenance, mission support, medical or large functional unit (e.g. communications) that provides the specified capability to a parent wing.    An independent functional group is a large functional unit that does not report to a wing; e.g., the 1st Civil Engineer Group under the 9th Air and Space Expeditionary Task Force. Temporary mission squadron assigned to an AETF.   xx Expeditionary [direct combat support-kind] Squadron Temporary direct combat support squadron assigned to an AETF.   xx Expeditionary [support-kind] Squadron Temporary support squadron assigned to an AETF.   AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate (e.g., 4 AEG)    A dependent group uses the numerical designation of its parent expeditionary wing (e.g., 4th Expeditionary Operations Group, 4th Expeditionary Mission Support Group)  An independent functional group uses the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate. Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate (e.g., 366th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron or 344th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron) Use the numerical designation of the major force provider unit or an authorized rainbow unit, as appropriate  (e.g., 819th Expeditionary RED HORSE Squadron or 5th Expeditionary Combat Communications Squadron) Use the numerical designation of its parent expeditionary wing or group (e.g., 4th Expeditionary AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 105 Temporary dependent detachment of an expeditionary unit.   Temporary dependent OL of an expeditionary unit   Detachment x, xx Expeditionary [functional-kind] [unit type] Operating Location (OL) x, xx Expeditionary [functional-kind] [unit type]  Logistics Readiness Squadron) Number in sequence starting with 1.  Use the unit designation of its parent unit (e.g., Detachment 1, 16th Expeditionary Special Operations Squadron) Alphabetized in sequence starting with A.  Use the unit designation of its parent unit (e.g., OL-A, 24th Expeditionary Special Tactics Squadron) 8.8.  Attaching/Assigning Provisional Units.  Provisional units are assigned to a higher echelon provisional unit or attached to a higher or same echelon permanent unit.  All expeditionary units are  assigned  to  an  AETF  or  attached  under  a  component  NAF  and  under  the  administrative control (ADCON) of the Air Force Service component for the geographic region in which forces are  based.    If  a  deployed  expeditionary  unit  is  not  assigned  or  attached  to  the  regional COMAFFOR (i.e., the forces are not formally transferred by Secretary of Defense order and the owning  unified  combatant  command  retains  control)  then  a  host-tenant  support  agreement  is required to define support requirements. 8.9.  Administrative  Control  (ADCON)  .    The  ADCON  responsibilities  of  the  gaining commander can vary by scenario and should be specified in G-Series orders.  The supporting and supported  MAJCOMs  must  work  together  to  ensure  the  degree  of  ADCON  responsibilities  is clearly understood.  Specified ADCON responsibilities are included in AFDD Volume 1, Basic Doctrine. 8.10.  UCMJ  authority  resides  concurrently  with  the  commanders  in  the  assigned  and attached  units,  and  does  not  need  to  be  explicitly  stated  in  G-series  orders.  See  51-series AFIs for specific information on disciplinary and UCMJ matters. 8.11.  G-Series  Orders.  AFI  33-328,  Administrative  Orders,  provides  guidance  on  the preparation  of  administrative  orders.    MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  and  DRUs  must  publish  G-series orders to activate, inactivate, redesignate, assign or attach provisional (including expeditionary) units. (T-1). The G-Series order provides the legal authority for provisional units.  Examples of G-Series  orders  for  provisional  and  expeditionary  units  are  shown  at  Figures  8.3.  –  8.7.  MAJCOMs,  FOAs,  and  DRUs  forward  copies  of  unclassified  and  classified  orders  to  HQ USAF/A1MO,  the  Air  Force  Historical  Research  Agency  (HQ  AFHRA/RSO,  600  Chennault Circle,  Maxwell,  AFB  AL  36112-6424),  and  all  units  mentioned  in  the  order.    MAJCOMs, FOAs,  and  DRUs  use  the  Air  Force  Organization  Status  Change  Report  (RCS:  HAF-HO  (M) 7401)  to  document  the  organizational  changes  to  provisional  units  IAW  AFI  84-105, Organization, Lineage, Honors, and Heraldry. 8.11.1.  G-series  orders  for  expeditionary  units  are  prepared  by  the  supported  MAJCOM (reference  Paragraph  8.7.1.)  or  in  cases  where  forces  are  not  attached,  by  the  MAJCOM retaining operational control.  The supporting and supported MAJCOMs must work closely 106 AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 together  on  drafting  the  G-series  orders  to  ensure  ADCON  responsibilities  are  spelled  out and the AETF commander’s concept for organization and unity of command are understood. 8.11.2.  Command Relationships.  The ground rules for command relationships are outlined in Joint Publication 1 and AFDD Volume 1.  The supported and supporting command must work  closely  together  to  develop  the  best  organization  structure  to  support  mission requirements and build a clear chain of command. 8.11.3.  Activation and inactivation dates may be specified in the same G-series order. 8.11.4.  MAJCOMs  may  add  the  name  of  the  operation  and  location  to  any  unit  in  the  G-series orders. 8.11.5.  G-Series  orders  should  be  classified  and  declassified  according  to  the  security classification  guidance  published  for  the  exercise  or  operation.    Classified  orders  have appropriate  paragraph  marking,  classified  by,  and  declassification  guidance.    Every  effort should be made to declassify the orders as soon as permissible or use a specific event  (i.e. activation date) as the declassification date. 8.11.6.  G-series  orders  for  recurring  and  major  exercise  (when  required)  units  follow  the same basic conventions as those used for expeditionary units. 8.11.7.  A  G-series  order  is  not  required  to  establish  a  provisional  or  permanent  MAJCOM headquarters.    A  DAF  A1M  letter  is  the  authority  and  establishes  the  specific  MAJCOM headquarters activation date. AFI38-101  31 JANUARY 2017 107 Figure 8.2.
