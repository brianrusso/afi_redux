SDRs  will be  submitted  for  discrepant  shipments  from  contractors/manufacturers  or  vendors regardless of dollar value. 1.7.3.  Check packages,  containers or equipment  containing hazardous materials for damage or leakage when loading or unloading the aircraft. When packages or overpacks containing hazardous  materials  have  been  transported  in  equipment  or  on  a  pallet,  check  the  area where the equipment or pallet was stowed. In the event of leakage or suspected leakage, the compartment  in  which  the  package,  overpack,  equipment,  or  pallet  was  carried  must  be inspected for contamination and decontaminated, if applicable. Remove from any package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking or contaminated by a hazardous material. In the case of a package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking, ensure that other packages, baggage or cargo are in proper condition for transport and that no other package, baggage or  cargo  has  been  contaminated  or  is  leaking.  Immediately  report  any  release  of  a hazardous  substance  in  a  quantity  equal  to  or  greater  than  its  reportable  quantity  to  the Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  by  calling  the  US  Coast  Guard  National Response  Center  at  800-424-8802  or  202-267-2675  or  using  the  NRC  On-line  Reporting Tool  http://www.nrc.uscg.mil/nrchp.html.  1.7.4.  Consult  local  installation  operating  procedures  for  hazardous  material  emergency planning,  response,  and  reporting  requirements  in  the  event  of  an  incident  involving hazardous materials. 1.7.5.  Do  not  move  dropped  or  damaged  explosive  items.  The  Transportation  or  Packaging Office will immediately contact Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), safety or munitions personnel to determine disposition. 1.7.6 Infectious Substance packages. If a package containing infectious substances is found to be  damaged  or  leaking  notify  technical  escorts,  Biological  Personnel  Reliability  Program (BPRP)  personnel  escorting  the  sample  or  medical  personnel.  Personnel  must:  (1)  avoid handling  the  package  or  keep  handling  to  a  minimum;  (2)  inspect  adjacent  packages  for contamination  and put  aside any that  may have been contaminated;  (3) notify the shipper and/or the receiver that the package has leaked. Upon discovering damage to the package, which indicates damage to the primary container, the carrier must isolate the container and notify the US Coast Guard National Response Center at 800-424-8802 or 202-267-2675.  1.8.  Stowing Hazardous Materials. 1.8.1.  Ensure hazardous materials are compatible (Attachment 18) when stored in transit. 1.8.2.  Ensure hazardous materials are accessible in flight. 1.8.3.  Ensure  hazard  markings  and  warning  labels  are  visible  to  aircrew  and  unloading personnel. 1.8.4.  Do not stow liquid or toxic hazardous materials on the same aircraft pallet with foodstuff, feed,  or  any  other  edible  material  intended  for  consumption  by  humans  or  animals.  Solid material, such as explosive articles, may be loaded on the same aircraft pallet with foodstuffs based  on  operational  requirements.  If  required  by  operational  necessity,  comply  with  the following  when  loading  foodstuff  or  MRE’s  on  the  same  463L  pallet  with  hazardous materials:  10       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  1.8.4.1.  Do not load MREs or other edible material on the same pallet with any hazardous material liquid or Class/division 2.3 gases. 1.8.4.2.  Separate  hazardous  materials  (except  Class  1)  from  the  foodstuff/MREs  by  the greatest distance possible, but not less than 44 inches in all directions. 1.8.4.3.  Do not load hazardous materials above the foodstuff/MRE's. 1.8.5.  Packages  bearing  orientation  arrow  (“This  Way  Up”)  labels  must  be  loaded,  stowed and handled at all times according to label direction. Single packagings with end closures must be loaded and stowed with closures upward. 1.9.  Protective Equipment.  The base must ensure availability of protective equipment to cope with  ground  emergencies  involving  the  cargo  during  loading  operations.  Coordinate respiratory and other personal protection requirements with the medical  service.  The aircraft operator  will  ensure  appropriate  equipment  is  available  to  protect  aircrew  and  passengers when transporting materials whose vapors are toxic, irritating or corrosive. Aircraft must have a closed oxygen system or protective mask for each person aboard. The shipper will provide any  required  special  equipment  to  meet  unique  cargo  safety  requirements.  It  is  the  shipper's responsibility to  consult  subject  matter experts (SME), and the SME will,  based on intimate knowledge  of  the  material,  determine  necessary  required  protective  equipment.  While  the exact  equipment  required  depends  on  the  materials  being  transported,  following  are  the recommended minimum (or equivalent substitutions): 1.9.1.  Two pairs of rubber gloves. 1.9.2.  One pair of protective gloves. 1.9.3.  One plastic or rubber apron. 1.9.4.  A five-pound (2.3 kg) package of incombustible absorbent material. 1.9.5.  Three large plastic bags (4-mil thick, as a minimum). 1.9.6.  One oxygen or protective mask for each person. 1.10.  Unitized, Palletized, Overpacked, or Containerized Loads.  Shippers must ensure aerial ports can handle loads. Ensure load configurations are: 1.10.1.  Unitized loads will be as stable as a single container. 1.10.2.  Freight containers (e.g., Internal airlift and helicopter Slingable Unit (ISU), Container Express  (CONEX),  Military-Owned  Demountable  Container  (MILVAN),  etc.)  are  not considered the outer package or overpack for any item stowed inside. Items within freight containers  must  be  packaged  as  prescribed  in  this  manual.  Since  air  movement  subjects cargo  to  rapid  acceleration  and  deceleration,  the  contents  of  freight  containers  must  be adequately secured/restrained to prevent damage or breakage from shifting. Consider both horizontal and vertical movement when securing/restraining the contents. 1.10.3.  Mark and label individual packages within overpacks and freight containers according to  this  manual  and  Military  Standard  –  129  (MIL-STD-129),  Military  Marking  for Shipment and Storage.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       11 1.10.4.  Designed to provide installed equipment in approved holders meeting airlift restraint criteria. 1.10.5.  Compatible as required by Attachment 18. 1.10.6.  Developed not using fiberboard or plywood sideboards unless specifically required by this manual. 1.10.7.  Marked and labeled according to Attachment 14 and Attachment 15. 1.10.8.  To  the  greatest  extent  possible,  place  packages  on  aircraft  pallets  (e.g.,  463L)  and within/on freight containers, vehicles, and trailers so that markings required by Attachment 14 and labels required by Attachment 15 are visible.  1.10.8.1.  For like items with the same classification, only one of the required hazard label(s) must be applied and visible. 1.10.8.2.

A  waiver  is  required  for  the  packaging/preparation of  aircraft/Unmanned  Aerial  Vehicle  (UAV)  when  not  prepared  IAW  the  appropriate Technical  Order  (T.O.).  Waiver  requests  must  be  initiated  by  the  user/owner  (for example,  Battlespace).  The  user/owner  must  complete  a  MFR  detailing  all  the  hazards that  exist,  or  no  longer  exist  based  on  determinations  by  EOD,  other  expert(s),  and  a review of the T.O. Ensure that owner/user addresses every part of the aircraft/UAV that is hazardous as listed in  the T.O. which details  aircraft/UAV preparation for shipment. Confirm  that  no  leaks,  fumes,  or  potential  detonation  hazards  exist.  EOD  will  inspect and  identify  in  writing  whether  explosive  material  is  present  or  has  been  cleared.  It  is incumbent on the requestor to ensure aircraft/UAVs are safe to move and experts have evaluated entire object. The Installation Transportation Officer (ITO) will then create a memo  describing  the  hazards  that  must  be  certified,  and  address  hazards  not  requiring certification.  Technically  capable  personnel  (user/ITO)  will  assess  the  packaging  and ensure it will contain/hold the aircraft/UAV. Describe in detail how the item is packaged for  air  transport.  (For  example,  This  UAV  is  packed  in  an  Aircraft  Coffin  (a  case), weighing  1508  kilograms  and  total  cube  is  14  cubic  meters.  The  case  is  considered airtight when it is closed, sealing the contents inside.) If it is determined hazard(s) exist but cannot be properly certified IAW the aircraft/UAV T.O., staff the memorandums to the  servicing  MAJCOM.  The  servicing  MAJCOM  will  staff  the  waiver  request  to  the MAJCOM with operational control of the transport aircraft. The ITO or Customs official will  notify  the  DOD  Customs  Program  Manager,  USTRANSCOM  J5J4-PT  for clearance of the transport aircraft to its destination within the Continental United States (CONUS). 2.3.4.2.

Pack  hand  carried lithium  batteries  in  original  wrapping  or  in  nonconductive  material  to  prevent  external short-circuiting.  Prepare  equipment  containing  lithium  batteries,  not  considered individual issue or basic combat, according to A13.7., A13.8., or A13.9.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       21 3.5.1.7.  The  troop  commander  or  team  chief  must  brief  the  aircraft  commander  or designated representative (i.e. loadmaster) on the location of all hazardous materials. 3.5.1.8.  Provisions of this paragraph may be used during exercises when identified in the exercise  operations  plan.  Except  for  small  arms  ammunition,  CBRNE  equipment,  and first  aid  kits,  items  will  not  be  shipped  unpackaged  unless  there  is  intent  to  use explosives  and  other  hazardous  materials  upon  exiting  the  aircraft  or  as  part  of  an airdrop  exercise.  Use  and  employment  of  unpackaged  or  hand  carried  explosives  and other hazardous materials will be included in the exercise operations plan. 3.5.1.9.  See Attachment 23 for use of contract air carriers operating under DOT-SP 9232. 3.5.1.10.  A Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods is not required. 3.5.2.  Personnel not immediately engaging the enemy force when deplaning, but will assume a  tactical  mission  on  arrival  or  re-deploying  upon  mission  completion,  may  deploy  with their  basic  load  or  individual  issue  of  hazardous  materials  in  accordance  with  paragraph 3.5.1.  However,  the  troop  commander  must  collect  these  items,  including  small  arms ammunition, before the anti-hijack briefing. On arrival at the aircraft, the troop commander must brief the loadmaster on the hazardous materials and assist the loadmaster, as directed, in the tie-down before departing. The hazardous materials will be redistributed on arrival at destination.  If  required,  apply  these  provisions  to  redeployment  of  troops  upon  mission completion. A Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods is not required. 3.6.  Passenger  Eligibility.  Participants  in  tactical,  contingency,  emergency,  or  deployment operations,  including  exercises,  transported  on  military  organic  aircraft  according  to this chapter  are  not  considered  passengers  for  purposes  of  this  manual.  If  passenger  seats  are released to nonparticipants, the cargo must not be prepared using a provision authorized under the  authority  of  this  chapter  and  the  requirements  of  2.2  apply.  Refer  to  Attachment  23  for contract airlift of personnel under DOT-SP 9232. 3.7.  Chemically Contaminated Cargo.  Decontaminate items to the greatest extent possible in the  theater  in  which  they  became  contaminated.  Destroy  reusable  wood  and  fiberboard containers  in  the  theater  in  which  they  became  contaminated.  Decontaminate  reusable shipping containers other than wood and fiberboard (drums, etc.) before reusing. Double wrap palletized cargo that is susceptible to exposure to contamination. Remove the outside wrap if exposed to contamination (the inner wrap should protect the cargo). Destroy the contaminated outside  wrap  in  the  theater  in  which  it  became  contaminated.  Contaminated  cargo  must  be evaluated  to  determine  the  appropriate  hazard  classification  so  that  the  cargo  may  be packaged, marked, labeled, documented, and shipped consistent with the hazard.  If this is not able to be done, then the chemically contaminated cargo will not be accepted for shipment on military aircraft.       JOHN B.

A2—The  maximum  activity  of  radioactive  material,  other  than  special  form,  low  specific activity radioactive material, and surface contaminated objects permitted in a type A package. These values are either listed in A11.4 or may be derived using the procedure in A11.3. Adsorbed  gas-  A  gas  which  when  packaged  for  transport  is  adsorbed  onto  a  solid  porous material resulting in an internal receptacle pressure of less than 101.3 kPa at 20 degrees C and less than 300 kPa at 50 degrees C.  28       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  Activity  (Radioactivity)—  The  number  of  radioactive  atoms  that  decay  per  unit  time.  The unit of activity is the curie or bequerel. The amount of radioactivity that may be transported in various types of packages and various types of vehicles. Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD)— Any airfield location where hazardous materials are received  by  military  controlled  airlift  whether  by  channel,  SAAM,  airdrop,  exercise,  or deployment. Aerial Port Of Embarkation (APOE)— Any airfield location where hazardous materials are entered  into  the  Defense  Transportation  System  IAW  DTR  4500.9-R,  for  movement  by military controlled airlift whether by channel, SAAM, airdrop, exercise, or deployment. Aerosol—Any non-refillable receptacle containing a gas compressed, liquefied, or  dissolved under pressure, the sole purpose of which is to expel a nonpoisonous (other than a division 6.1 packing  group  III  material)  liquid,  paste,  or  powder  and  fitted  with  a  self-closing  release device allowing the contents to be ejected as solid or liquid particles in suspension in a gas, as a foam, paste, or powder, or in a liquid or gaseous state. Article—A  manufactured  item,  containing  a  hazardous  material  or  substance,  in  a  specific shape  or  design  which  end  use  is  dependent  on  the  shape  or  design.  The  shape  or  design prevents loss of hazardous contents during normal conditions of transport. Atmospheric Pressure—Atmospheric pressure is 101.3kPa (14.7 psi). Aviation Regulated Solid or Liquid—Any material which has a narcotic, noxious, or other properties such that in  the event  of spillage or leakage on an  aircraft,  extreme annoyance or discomfort  could  be  caused  to  crew  members  so  as  to  prevent  the  correct  performance  of assigned duties. Bag—A  flexible  packaging  made  of  paper,  plastic  film,  textiles,  woven  material  or  other similar materials. Becquerel (Bq)—The unit of measure for the activity of a radioactive material. Because this is a very small unit of measure (1 Bq = one atomic transformation per second), the standard is the larger multiple terabecquerel (TBq). One TBq = one trillion Bq. Other multiples may also be used (MBq, GBq). This unit of measure is used when measuring how radioactive the item is. Biological  Product—A  virus,  therapeutic  serum,  toxin,  antitoxin,  vaccine,  blood,  blood component  or  derivative,  allergenic  product,  or  analogous  product  used  in  the  prevention, diagnosis, treatment, or cure of diseases in humans or animals. A biological product includes a material manufactured and distributed in accordance with one of the following provisions:  -  Title 9,Code of Federal Regulations, Part 102, Licenses for Biological Products, current edition;  9  CFR  Part  103  (Experimental  Products,  Distribution,  and  Evaluation  of Biological  Products  Prior  to  Licensing);  9  CFR  Part  104,  Permits  for  Biological Products;  -  Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 312 Investigational New Drug Application; 21 CFR Part 314 Applications for FDA Approval to Market a New Drug; 21 CFR Parts 600 to  680,  Biologics;  or  21  CFR  Part  812  Investigational  Device  Exemptions.  Unless  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       29 otherwise  excepted,  a  biological  product  known  or  reasonably  expected  to  contain  a pathogen  that  meets  the  definition  of  a  Category  A  or  B  infectious  substance  must  be assigned the identification number UN2814, UN2900, or UN3373, as appropriate. Biological Substances, Category B - An infectious substance not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs. Bottle—An inner packaging having a neck of relatively smaller cross section than the body and an opening capable of holding a closure for retention of the contents. Box—A  packaging  with  complete  rectangular  or  polygonal  faces  made  of  metal,  wood, plywood, reconstituted wood, fiberboard, plastic, or other suitable material. Bulk Packaging—  A packaging, other than a vessel or a barge, including a transport vehicle or freight  container,  in  which  hazardous  materials  are  loaded  with  no  intermediate  form  of containment. A  Large Packaging in  which hazardous materials  are loaded with  an intermediate form of containment, such as one or more articles or inner packagings, is also a bulk packaging. Additionally, a bulk packaging has: a maximum capacity greater than 450 L (119 gallons) as a receptacle for a liquid; a maximum net mass greater than 400 kg (882 pounds) and a maximum capacity greater than 450 L (119 gallons) as a receptacle for a solid; or a water capacity greater than 454 kg (1000 pounds) as a receptacle for a gas as defined in 49 CFR §173.115. Channel  Airlift—Common  user  airlift  service  provided  on  a  scheduled  basis  between  two points. Class  1  (Explosives)—Any  substance  or  article  (including  a  device)  which  is  designed  to function by explosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas and heat). Unless the substance or article is otherwise classed in Table A4.1., the term "explosive" may also refer to an item that is able to produce a chemical reaction within itself and is able to function in a similar manner even if not designed to function by explosion. Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows: 1.  Division 1.1-Consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously. 2.  Division 1.2-Consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard.  Additionally,  there  are  three  subdivisions  (1.2.1,  1.2.2  and  1.2.3).  Refer  to  DOD 6055.9-STD, DOD Ammunition  and Explosives Safety Standards, for specific subdivision definitions. 3.    Division  1.3-Consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard (or both), but not a mass explosion hazard.  4.    Division  1.4-Consists  of  explosive  devices  that  present  a  minor  explosion  hazard.  The explosive  effects  are  largely  confined  to  the  package  and  no  projection  of  fragments  of appreciable  size  or  range  is  to  be  expected.  An  external  fire  must  not  cause  virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.  5.    Division  1.5-Consists  of  very  insensitive  explosives.  This  division  is  comprised  of substances  which  have  a  mass  explosion  hazard  but  are  so  insensitive  that  there  is  very  30       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  little  probability  of  initiation  or  of  transition  from  burning  to  detonation  under  normal transportation conditions.  6.    Division  1.6-Consists of extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosion hazard.  This  division  is  comprised  of  articles  which  contain  only  extremely  insensitive detonating  substances  and  which  demonstrate  a  negligible  probability  of  accidental initiation or propagation. The risk from these articles is limited to the explosion of a single article. Class/Division 2.1 (Flammable Gas)—Any material that is a gas (boiling point) at 20 degrees C (68  degrees  F)  or  less  and  has  a  pressure  of  101.3  kPa  (14.7  psia),  in  addition  to  one  of  the following properties: 1.  Is ignitable at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) when in a mixture of 13 percent or less by volume with air.  2.  Has a flammable range of 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) with air of at least 12 percent regardless of the lower limit.  3.  The limits specified above shall be determined at 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia) of pressure and a temperature  of  20  degrees  C  (68  degrees  F)  according  to  ASTM  E681-85  Standard  Test Method for Concentration Limits of Flammability of Chemicals. Class/Division 2.2 (Nonflammable, Nonpoisonous Compressed Gas, Including Compressed Gas,  Liquefied  Gas,  Pressurized  Cryogenic  Gas,  Compressed  Gas  in  Solution, asphyxiant gas  and  oxidizing  gas)—  Any  material  (or  mixture)  which  exerts  in  the  packaging  a  gauge pressure of 200 kPa (29 psig/43.8 psia) or greater at 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), is a liquefied gas or is a cryogenic liquid, and does not meet the definition of Division 2.1 or 2.3. Class/Division 2.3 (Gas Poisonous by Inhalation)—Any material that is a gas (boiling point) at 20 degrees C (68 degrees F) or less and has a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 psia), in  addition  to one of the following properties: 1.    The  material  is  known  to  be  so  toxic  to  humans  as  to  pose  a  hazard  to  health  during transportation.  2.  In the absence of adequate data on human toxicity, the material is presumed to be toxic to humans because when tested it has an LC50 (inhalation toxicity) value of not more than 5000 parts per million (ppm).  Class 3 (Flammable Liquid)—A flammable liquid is any liquid having a flash point equal to or below  60  degrees  C  (140  degrees  F),  or  liquids offered  for  transportation  at  temperatures  at  or above their flash point, except: 1.  Any liquid meeting the definition of a Class 2 material.  2.  Any mixture having one or more compounds with a flash point above 60 degrees C (140 degrees  F)  that  makes  up  at  least  99  percent  of  the  total  volume  of  the mixture.  Distilled spirits of 140 proof or lower are considered to have a flash point no lower than 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).   AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       31 Class/Division  4.1  (Flammable  Solids)—Flammable  solids  consist  of  solids  (other  than  those classed as explosives) which are readily combustible under conditions encountered in transport, or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Class/Division 4.2 (Spontaneously Combustible Material)—Liquids or solids which are prone to spontaneous heating under normal conditions encountered in transport or to heating in contact with air, thus being liable to ignite. Class/Division  4.3  (Dangerous  When  Wet  Material)—Solids  that  are  liable  to  become spontaneously  flammable  or  emit  flammable  or  toxic  gases  when  they  come  into  contact  with water. Class/Division 5.1 (Oxidizers)—A material that may cause or enhance the combustion of other material, generally by yielding oxygen. Class/Division 5.2 (Organic Peroxides)—Any organic compound containing oxygen (O) in the bivalent -O-O- structure, and which may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide where one or more of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals.  Organic peroxides are thermally  unstable  substances  which  may  undergo  exothermic  self-accelerating decomposition. These substances may be prone to explosive decomposition or rapid burning; be sensitive  to  impact  or  friction;  react  dangerously  with  other  material;  or  cause  damage  to  the eyes. A material which meets this definition must be classed in Class 5.2, unless it also meets the definition  of  a  Class  1  material,  or  unless  the  available  oxygen  content  of  an  organic  peroxide formulation is less than the amount specified (by the percentage equation) in 49 CFR §173.128. 1.    Type  A:  An  organic  peroxide  that  can  detonate  or  deflagrate  rapidly  as  packaged  for transport. Transportation of type A organic peroxides is forbidden.  2.    Type  B:  An  organic  peroxide  that,  as  packaged  for  transport,  neither  detonates  nor deflagrates rapidly, but can undergo a thermal explosion.  3.    Type  C:  An  organic  peroxide  that,  as  packaged  for  transport,  neither  detonates  or deflagrates rapidly and cannot undergo a thermal explosion.  4.  Type D: An organic peroxide which exhibits the following characteristics:  4.1.    Detonates  only  partially,  but  does  not  deflagrate  rapidly  and  is  not  affected  by  heat when confined.  4.2.    Does  not  detonate,  deflagrates  slowly,  and  shows  no  violent  effect  if  heated  when confined.  4.3.    Does  not  detonate  or  deflagrate,  and  shows  a  medium  effect  when  heated  under confinement.  5.    Type  E:  An  organic  peroxide  that  neither  detonates  or  deflagrates,  and  shows  low  or  no effect when heated under confinement.  6.  Type F: An organic peroxide that will not detonate in a cavitated state, does not deflagrate, shows low or no effect if heated when confined, and has low or no explosive power.  7.  Type G: An organic peroxide that will not detonate in a cavitated state, will not deflagrate, shows  no  effect  when  heated  under  confinement,  has  no  explosive  power,  is  thermally stable  (self—accelerating  decomposition  temperature  is  50  degrees  C  (122  degrees  F)  or  32       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  higher for a 50 kg (110 pounds) package). An organic peroxide meeting all characteristics of type G except thermal stability and requiring temperature control is classed as a type F, temperature control organic peroxide. Class/Division 6.1 (Poisonous/Toxic Material)—A material, other than a gas, which is known to be so toxic to humans as to afford a hazard to health during transportation, or is presumed to be  toxic  to  humans  because  it  falls  within  one  of  the  test  categories  identified  in  49  CFR §173.132. The term “toxic” and “poisonous” are used synonymously in this manual. Class/Division  6.2  (Infectious  Substances)—A  material  known  to  contain  or  suspected  of containing  a  pathogen.  A  pathogen  is  a  virus  or  micro-organism  (including  bacteria  viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi), or other agent such as a proteinaceous infectious particle (prion) that can  cause  disease  in  humans  or  animals.

Any  continuously  vented  type  B(M)  packages,  which  require  external cooling by an auxiliary cooling system or packages subject to operational controls during transport. A3.3.7.4.4.3.  Any liquid pyrophoric radioactive materials. A3.3.7.4.5.  Do  not  transport  exclusive  use  shipments  of  packages  having  a  surface radiation level in excess of 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) except by special arrangement. A3.3.7.5.  Stowage on Aircraft or Storage Incident to Transportation. A3.3.7.5.1.  Do not ship radioactive Category II-Yellow or Category III-Yellow material on the same aircraft or store in any one area, such as a transit area, terminal building,  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       83 storeroom,  or  assembly  yard,  if  the  sum  of  the  criticality  safety  indices  in  any individual group of packages exceeds 50. (49 CFR §173.447, 173.457, and §175.702) A3.3.7.5.2.  If  the  total  criticality  safety  indices  for  all  packages,  overpacks,  or  freight containers  exceeds  50,  separate  the  packages  overpacks,  or  freight  containers  into groups. Store groups of these packages so as to maintain a spacing of at least 6 meters (20 feet) from each other group. A3.3.7.5.3.  Ensure  separation  of  Category  II-Yellow  or  Category  III-Yellow  material from  packages  containing  undeveloped  film  according  to  the  distances  shown  in  49 CFR §175.706. A3.3.7.5.4.  Radioactive  Category  II-Yellow  and  Category  III-Yellow  material  must  be separated from persons or animals by a minimum of 2 pallet positions (176 inches) at all  times  while  on  the  aircraft.  If  the  total  transport  index  of  all  packages  on  the aircraft  exceeds  50,  the  separation  distance  between  the  surfaces  of  the  radioactive materials  packages  and  the  surfaces  bounding  the  space  occupied  by  persons  or animals must be at least 9 m (30 feet). A3.3.7.5.5.  The maximum limits are as follows: A3.3.7.5.5.1.  A maximum transport index of 10 per individual package. A3.3.7.5.5.2.  A maximum criticality safety index of 100 per aircraft. A3.3.7.5.5.3.  A maximum transport index of 200 per aircraft. A3.3.7.6.  Radioactive Contamination. A3.3.7.6.1.  Contamination Control. Keep the level of nonfixed (removable) radioactive contamination on the external surfaces of each package offered for shipment as low as practical.  The level  of nonfixed radioactive contamination  may be determined by wiping an area of 300 cm2 of the surface concerned with an absorbent material, using moderate pressure, and measuring the activity on the wiping material. Take sufficient measurements in the most appropriate locations to yield a representative assessment of  the  nonfixed  contamination  levels.  The  amount  of  radioactivity  measured  on  any single  wiping  material  divided  by  the  surface  area  wiped  and  divided  by  the efficiency of the wipe procedure may not exceed the limits set forth in Table A3.3. at any time during transport. Other methods of assessment of equal or greater efficiency may be used. A3.3.7.6.2.  Inspecting  Aircraft  for  Contamination.  Periodically  check  aircraft  used  to routinely  transport  radioactive  materials  for  radioactive  contamination.  Determine frequency  of  the  checks  based  on  the  likelihood  of  contamination  and  the  extent  to which radioactive materials are carried aboard the aircraft. An aircraft must be taken out of service if the radiation dose rate at any accessible surface is 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h)  or  if  there  is  significant  removable  radioactive  surface  contamination  as outlined above.  84       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017   Table A3.3.

Transport Index and Criticality Safety Index (CSI). A3.3.7.7.1.  Transport Index – Radiation Exposure Control. A3.3.7.7.1.1.  The  TI  for  a  package,  overpack,  or  freight  container  is  the  number derived using the following procedure: A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.  Determine the maximum radiation level at a distance of 1 m from the  external  surfaces  of  the  package,  overpack,  or  freight  container.  If  the radiation  level  is  determined  in  units  of  millisievert  per  hour  (mSv/h),  then multiply the value by 100 to convert to units of millirem per hour (mrem/h). If the radiation level is determined in units of millirem per hour, then the value is not  changed.  For  uranium  and  thorium  ores  and  concentrates,  the  maximum radiation dose rate at any point 1 m from the external surface of the load may be taken as follows: A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.1.  For ores and physical concentrates of uranium and thorium  - 0.4 mSv/h (40 mrem/h). A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.2.  For  chemical  concentrates  of  thorium  –  0.3  mSv/h  (30 mrem/h). A3.3.7.7.1.1.1.3.  For  chemical  concentrates  of  uranium,  other  than  uranium hexafluoride – 0.02 mSv/h (2 mrem/h). A3.3.7.7.1.1.2.  For  freight  containers,  the  value  determined  in  A3.3.7.7.1.1.1. must be multiplied by the appropriate factor from Table A3.4.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       85  Table A3.4.

The  figure  obtained  in  A3.3.7.7.1.1.1  and  A3.3.7.7.1.1.2  must  be rounded  up  to  the  first  decimal  place  (e.g.  1.13  becomes  1.2),  except  that  a value of 0.05 or less may be considered as zero. A3.3.7.7.1.2.  Transport Index – Consignment. The transport index for each overpack or  freight  container  must  be  determined  as  either  the  sum  of  the  TIs  of  all  the packages contained, or by direct measurement of radiation level, except in the case of non-rigid  overpacks for which the transport index must be determined only as the sum of the TIs of all the packages. A3.3.7.7.2.  Determination  of  Criticality  Safety  Index  (CSI).  The  Criticality  Safety Index (CSI) for packages containing fissile material is determined in accordance with the  instructions  provided  in  10  CFR  Part  71.  The  CSI  for  an  overpack,  freight container, or consignment containing fissile material packages is the sum of the CSIs of all the fissile material packages contained within the overpack, freight container or consignment. A3.3.7.8.  General Package Design Requirements. A3.3.7.8.1.  The  packaging  for  the  transport  of  radioactive  material  must  provide  the following: A3.3.7.8.1.1.  Containment to prevent contamination of people and the environment. A3.3.7.8.1.2.  Protection  from  radiation.  The  type  of  packaging  depends  on  the amount and type of radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, neutron). A3.3.7.8.1.3.  Prevention of criticality in fissile material. A3.3.7.8.1.4.  Protection from internal heat generation. A3.3.7.8.2.  Design each package used for shipment of radioactive materials so that: A3.3.7.8.2.1.  The  package  can  be  easily  handled  and  properly  secured  during transport. A3.3.7.8.2.2.  Each  lifting  attachment  on  the  package,  when  used  in  the  intended manner, with  a minimum  safety factor of three, does not  impose an unsafe stress on  the  structure  of  the  package.  In  addition,  design  the  lifting  attachment  so  that  86       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  failure under excessive load does not impair the ability of the package to meet all other  requirements  of  this  attachment  and  Attachment  11.  Remove,  make inoperable  for  transport,  or  design  with  equivalent  strength  for  lifting  each attachment  or  other  feature  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  packaging  that  could  be used to lift the package. A3.3.7.8.2.3.  The external surface, as far as practical, may be easily decontaminated. A3.3.7.8.2.4.  The  outer  layer  of  packaging  avoids,  as  far  as  practicable,  pockets  or crevices where water might collect. A3.3.7.8.2.5.  Each feature that is added to the package at the time of transport, and is not a part of the package, does not reduce the safety of the package. A3.3.7.8.2.6.  The  package  will  be  capable  of  withstanding  the  effects  of  any acceleration, vibration, or vibration resonance that may occur during transportation without  any  deterioration  in  the  effectiveness  of  any  of  the  closing  devices  or  in the integrity of the package and without loosening or unintentionally releasing the nuts, bolts, or other securing devices. A3.3.7.8.2.7.  The  package  will  be  capable  of  withstanding,  without  leakage,  an internal  pressure  that  produces  a  pressure  differential  of  not  less  than  the maximum normal operating pressure plus 95 kPa (14 psi). A3.3.7.8.2.8.  The  packaging  materials  and  any  components  will  be  physically  and chemically compatible with each other and the contents. A3.3.7.8.2.9.  All  valves  through  which  the  package  contents  could  escape  will  be protected against unauthorized operation. A3.3.7.9.  Additional Packaging Design Requirements for Type A and B Packages. A3.3.7.9.1.  In  addition  to  meeting  the  general  design  requirements  each  Type  A packaging  must  also  meet  the  design  requirements  of  49  CFR  §173.412  and  test requirements of 49 CFR §173.461 and §173.465. A3.3.7.9.2.  Each  type  B(U)  or  type  B(M)  package  must  meet  the  design  and  test requirements of 10 CFR Part 71. A3.3.7.9.3.  Each shipper of a DOT 7A package must maintain on file for at least 1 year after  the  latest  shipment  complete  documentation  of  tests  and  an  engineering evaluation  or  comparative  data  showing  that  the  construction  methods,  packaging design,  and  materials  of  construction  comply  with  that  specification.  Unless otherwise required, the shipper is exempt from maintaining this documentation if it is maintained  by  the  Inventory  Control  Point  (national  stock  number  managing activity). A3.3.7.10.  Radiation Level and Thermal Limitations. A3.3.7.10.1.  Design each package of radioactive materials so that: A3.3.7.10.1.1.  The  radiation  level  is  not  more  than  2  mSv/h  (200  mrem/h)  at  any  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       87 point on the external surface of the package. 49 CFR §173.441 A3.3.7.10.1.2.  The transport index is not over 10. 49 CFR §173.441 A3.3.7.10.2.  Design, construct, and load each package of radioactive material so that: A3.3.7.10.2.1.  The heat generated within the package due to the radioactive contents will not, at any time during transportation, affect the integrity of the package under normal transportation conditions. A3.3.7.10.2.2.  The  temperature  of  the  accessible  external  surfaces  of  the  loaded package  will  not,  assuming  still  air  in  the  shade  at  an  ambient  temperature  of  38 degrees  C  (100  degrees  F),  exceed  either  a  temperature  of  50  degrees  C  (122 degrees F) in other than an exclusive use shipment or 85 degrees C (185 degrees F) in an exclusive use shipment.

However,  fuel  levels  cannot  exceed  limits  established  in  the  packaging paragraph.  When  technical  directives  do  not  specify  fuel  levels  for  shipment,  the requirements of the packaging paragraph apply. Actual fuel levels will be determined by a fuel gauge. In absence of an operational fuel gauge, use a graduated dip stick. If positive means is not available to accurately determine fuel level, drain or siphon the tank. The tank may be refilled to appropriate level in the presence of an inspector (see paragraph A28.1.2.). A3.3.9.4.2.  Do not remove other hazardous materials from their packaging and store in the racks or containers of vehicles or equipment unless authorized by paragraph A5.3. A3.3.9.4.3.  Fire Suppression Systems. Vehicles and equipment integral fire suppression systems  will  be  safed,  secured,  or  disabled  to  prevent  accidental  activation  during transportation. A3.3.9.4.4.    The  descriptions  for  engines  installed  in  SE  are  changing.  The  old descriptions  of  UN3166,  Engines,  internal  combustion,  flammable  gas  powered  or Engines,  fuel  cell,  flammable  gas  powered,  and  UN3166,  Engines,  internal combustion,  flammable  liquid  powered  or  Engines,  fuel  cell,  flammable  liquid powered  may  continue  to  be  used  until  31  December  2017.  Three  new  UN identification  numbers  and  proper  shipping  names  were  created  for  engines  or machinery internal combustion and assigned a hazard classification based on the type of fuel used. The three new UN numbers and proper shipping names are as follows: a Class  3  entry  “UN  3528,  Engine,  internal  combustion  engine,  flammable  liquid powered,  or  Engine  fuel  cell,  flammable  liquid  powered,  or  Machinery,  internal combustion,  flammable  liquid  powered,  or  Machinery,  fuel  cell,  flammable  liquid powered”;  a  Division  2.1  entry  “UN  3529,  Engine,  internal  combustion  engine, flammable gas powered, or Engine fuel cell, flammable gas powered, or Machinery, internal combustion, flammable gas powered, or Machinery, fuel cell, flammable gas powered”; and a Class 9 entry “UN 3530, Engine, internal combustion, or Machinery, internal combustion. The new descriptions must be used on and after 1 January 2018. A3.3.9.5.  Unregulated Engines and Fuel Components. The following items when drained, purged,  and  containing  no  other  hazardous  materials  are  nonhazardous  for transportation. Comply with paragraph A3.1.16.4. A3.3.9.5.1.  Vehicles  and  internal  combustion  engines,  with  or  without  fuel  tanks attached,  prepared  for  shipment  according  to  applicable  technical  directives  or standards.  Fuel  systems  including  carburetors,  pumps,  controls,  and  fuel  tanks  must  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       93 be  completely  drained,  purged,  and  sealed  with  appropriate  pressure  seal  type  plug and caps with gaskets and “O” rings. A3.3.9.5.2.  Aircraft engines which are drained and purged according to the responsible technical manual, and containing no other hazardous materials. A3.3.9.5.3.  Fuel  tanks,  and  cells  that  are  drained,  purged,  and  sealed  according  to  the applicable technical directive. A3.3.9.5.4.  All  preserved  and  packed  serviceable  fuel  assemblies,  for  example, carburetors,  fuel  pumps,  filters,  etc.,  that  are  drained  and  purged  of  all  fuel.  In addition,  they  must  be  sealed  with  proper  caps,  plugs,  and  covers  according  to  the applicable  technical  directive.  Use  a  barrier  bag  to  contain  residual  purging  fluid. Mark the type of purging fluid used and the flash point on the outer container. A3.3.9.6.  Dry Ice. A3.3.9.6.1.  Properties of Carbon Dioxide, Solid. At temperatures above -78.5 degrees C (-109.3  degrees  F)  dry  ice  sublimates  and  releases  carbon  dioxide  fumes.  If  the carbon  dioxide  concentration  in  the  aircraft  is  over  0.5  percent,  crewmembers  may suffer shortness of breath. Carbon dioxide concentrations of 3.0 percent are endurable from  1/2  to  1 hour. Concentrations of 5.0 percent  are dangerous from 1/2  to  1 hour and  concentrations  of  9.0  percent  are  fatal  from  5  to  10  minutes.  Carbon  dioxide  is heavier than air; therefore, the highest concentration is at or near floor level. Caution crewmembers against lying on the cargo compartment floor or remaining in the cargo compartment  for  a  prolonged  period.  If  symptoms  of  overexposure  are  noted,  use oxygen and increased ventilation to provide rapid relief. A3.3.9.6.2.  Seat  passengers  forward  of  and  separate  by  the  greatest  distance  possible (minimum one full pallet position) from dry ice. A3.3.9.6.3.  Passenger and crewmembers will not occupy the same pallet position as dry ice. A3.3.9.6.4.  Do  not  carry  dry  ice  (exceeding  passenger  acceptable  carry-on  quantities specified in Attachment 22) in any upper deck compartment. A3.3.9.6.5.  Vent the aircraft cargo compartment to the greatest extent possible allowed by the flight profile and environmental conditions. A3.3.9.6.6.  Quantity limits specified in this paragraph apply to all personnel, other than aircrew  members,  who  occupy  the  cargo  compartment  with  dry  ice.  Aircrew members  entering  cargo  compartments  exceeding  quantity  limits  specified  in  this paragraph must take precautions to prevent oxygen deprivation (i.e. oxygen masks). A3.3.9.6.7.  Pressurized  Aircraft.  For  pressurized  aircraft,  the  amount  of  dry  ice  that can  be  safely  shipped  by  air  regardless  of  the  type  container  used  depends  on  the sublimation rate of the ice, the volume of the aircraft, and the number of air changes per hour. To minimize the sublimation rate, use insulated containers surrounded with insulating blankets  and tarpaulin during shipment to  the greatest extent possible. To determine the amount of dry ice that can be safely shipped by air, use the formula in Figure A3.6. The formula in Figure A3.6. does not apply to C-130 Aircraft. Aircraft  94       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  specific limits for C-17 aircraft are shown in Figure A3.7 and C-5 aircraft are shown in Figure A3.8. Figure A3.6.  Formula For Determining Dry Ice Limitations. Figure A3.7.  Maximum Quantities for Dry Ice Aboard C-17 Aircraft.  NOTE: Above quantities are the maximum amounts for operating with no passengers in the cargo compartment. Limitation with passengers in the cargo compartment is set at 1,040 pounds (472 kilograms) for both high and normal flow.    AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       95 Figure A3.8.  Maximum Quantities for Dry Ice Aboard C-5 Aircraft.  NOTES: 1.  The Environmental Control System (ECS) must be operated with “both” air conditioning units on a “Normal” flow control valve and the “Intermediate” setting on the alternative air valve.  2.  The auxiliary vent value must be open for this condition.  3.  The air turbine motor is at idle. The auxiliary vent valve must be open for this condition.  A3.3.9.6.8.  Aircraft  on  Minimum  Air  Changes.  When  aircraft  is  on  minimum  air changes  per  hour,  safe  loads  are  drastically  reduced.  When  the  aircraft  is  on  the ground longer than 45 minutes, recalculate the safe quantity using new numbers of air changes per hour. Table A3.6.  Dry Ice Limitations When Aircraft is on Minimum Air Changes. KC-135 Aircraft Maximum Amount In Pounds 200 In Kilograms 91 A3.3.9.6.9.  KC-10  Aircraft.  Dry  ice  may  be  carried  in  the  KC-10  cargo  compartment under the following aircraft operating conditions: A3.3.9.6.9.1.  If  "one"  air  conditioning  pack  is  lost  in  flight,  then  accomplish emergency  procedures  for  cabin.  Turn  Cargo  Smoke  Light  on  per  KC-10  flight manual T.O. 1C-10(K)A-1, Section II. Include "Smoke Source is not Accessible" portion of procedure except do not put cabin pressure control in manual and do not depressurize cabin. A3.3.9.6.9.2.  Environmental  curtain  at  station  615  or  879:  If  "one"  air  conditioning pack is lost in flight, then accomplish emergency procedures for cabin, turn cargo smoke light on, mixed passenger and cargo configuration per KC-10 flight manual T.O 1C-10(k) A-1, section II, except do not initiate firefighting procedures. A3.3.9.6.9.3.  During  cargo  loading,  the  following  procedures  apply  to  minimize carbon dioxide concentration: A3.3.9.6.9.3.1.  Ensure  APU  is  running  and  "both"  air  conditioning  packs  are operating.  96       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A3.3.9.6.9.3.2.  Open number 4 passenger service door for additional ventilation. A3.3.9.6.9.3.3.  Open  all  air  inlets  in  the  aerial  refueling  operator’s  station  and close aerial refueling operators hatch. A3.3.9.6.9.3.4.  Ensure environmental curtain is closed before flight. A3.3.9.6.9.3.5.  Transport maximum quantities as shown in Figure A3.10. Figure A3.9.  Maximum Quantities for Dry Ice Aboard KC-10 Aircraft. A3.3.9.6.10. C-130 Aircraft. Safety Considerations. Dry ice may be transported aboard C-130 Aircraft if the following conditions are met:  A3.3.9.6.10.1. Crewmembers should be instructed to monitor themselves and others for any signs/symptoms of possible overexposure to carbon dioxide gas, to include shortness  of  breath,  dizziness,  confusion,  cognitive  impairment/poor  decision-making, headaches, or nausea. A3.3.9.6.10.2. The Environmental Control System (ECS) must be operated with both air conditioning packs on. In the event of an air-pack failure the air exchange rate is reduced by half, which reduces the amount of allowable dry ice by half. If this occurs  during  flight,  decrease  cruise  altitude  to  the  lowest  acceptable  altitude  for safe  flight  in  order  to  enhance  ventilation.  Manually  open  the  CROSS  FLOW VALVE  to  allow  maximum  air  interchange  between  the  flight  station  and  cargo compartment. A3.3.9.6.10.3.  If  symptoms  of  CO2  overexposure  become  evident  and  are  not mitigated by reducing cruise altitude, the aircraft should land as soon as possible. Supplemental  oxygen,  using  quick-don  masks  or  similar,  are  to  be  used  if necessary. A3.3.9.6.10.4. The formula presented in Figure A3.6 does not apply to C-130 aircraft.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       97 A3.3.9.6.10.5. C-130H Aircraft. Figure A3.11 is for C-130H variants with a quantity of two (2) 70 pound per minute air conditioning packs only. Table  A3.7.

Use  of  wing  and  empennage  anti-icing  on  C-130J  aircraft deactivates the cargo compartment ECS. Refer to A3.3.9.6.11.2. when wing and empennage anti-icing is used at any time other than during taxi, takeoff and descent. A3.3.9.6.11.  Non-pressurized Aircraft. For non-pressurized aircraft, the amount of dry ice  that  can  be  safely  shipped  by  air  depends  upon  the  sublimation  rate  and ventilation of the aircraft. To minimize the sublimation rate, use insulated containers surrounded with insulating blankets and tarpaulins. The aircraft must have maximum ventilation during the shipment. With unpressurized cargo compartment, the quantity of dry ice that can be transported is unlimited if the fumes are vented overboard the aircraft. A3.3.9.6.12.  AMC  Contract  Aircraft.  Do  not  transport  more  than  440  pounds  (200 kilograms) of dry ice in a cargo compartment of AMC contract aircraft without prior approval from the individual air carrier. A3.3.9.6.13.  Packaging.  Use  fiberboard  boxes,  polystyrene  foam  containers,  or  other suitable packaging designed and constructed to permit the release of carbon dioxide gas and to  prevent  a build-up of pressure that could  rupture the packaging. Use UN specification packaging when required by this manual. A3.3.9.7.  Consumer  Commodities.  Inner  packagings  containing  hazardous  liquids  re-classified  as  a  Consumer  Commodity  must  be  capable  of  meeting  internal  air  gauge pressure requirements of A3.1.7.1.  98       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A3.4.  Household  Goods  (HHG)  Shipments.  DTR  4500.9-R,  Part  IV,  Personal  Property establishes requirements for the movement of HHG and specifies that hazardous materials are not  authorized  for  military  airlift.  One  exception  is  that  engine  power-driven  equipment (motorcycle, moped, lawnmower, boat, snowmobile, etc.) may be transported as HHG under the following requirements: A3.4.1.  Completely drain all fuel. A3.4.2.  Run until the engine stalls. A3.4.3.  Drain all oil and cooling fluids. A3.4.4.  Allow fuel tanks and lines to remain open for at least 24 hours prior to pickup. A3.4.5.  Disconnect  non-spillable  gel-type  batteries  and  tape  the  connection  ends  to  prevent short  circuit.  Batteries  may  remain  in  the  equipment  holder,  but  ensure  they  are  firmly secured  and  remain  upright  in  the  shipping  container.  Do  not  ship  batteries  with  acid  or alkali. A3.4.6.  Engine  power-driven  equipment  prepared  in  this  manner  are  not  regulated  by  this manual. A Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods is not required.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       99 Attachment 4 ITEMS LISTING A4.1.  General Requirements.  This attachment contains: A4.1.1.  An alphabetical listing of the hazardous materials subject to the requirements of this manual. See paragraph A3.1.16. for material determined to be nonhazardous. A4.1.2.  Classification criteria for hazard classes. See Attachment 1 for definitions. A4.1.3.  Identification of items prohibited for military air transportation. A4.1.4.  Listing of Hazardous Substances and applicable Reportable Quantities. A4.2.  Classifying Hazardous Materials. A4.2.1.  Hazard  Class  Names.  The  hazard  class  and  division  is  a  numerical  identification which describes the class (type) of primary hazard involved and if appropriate, its division within  the  class.  Use  the  Hazardous  Material  Information  Resource  System  (HMIRS), product Safety Data Sheet, or other manufacturer’s information if assistance in determining the  hazard  classification  is  needed.  Figure  A4.1  lists  class  and  division  numbers  and  the corresponding class and division names. Figure A4.1.  Hazard Classes.   100       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A4.2.2.  Items  Not  Specifically  Listed.  If  a  material  is  not  specifically  listed  in  Table  A4.1., determine the PSN by comparing the characteristics of the items with the definitions of the various hazard classes in this manual. Assign a "Not Otherwise Specified" (N.O.S.) name based on the hazard class of the material. Examples are: "FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S.; CORROSIVE  SOLID,  N.O.S."  Attachment  1  contains  hazardous  class  definitions. Determine the appropriate technical name according to A4.5.2. A4.2.3.  Tentative  PSN  Assignment.  A  material  for  which  the  hazard  class  must  be determined  by  testing,  or  a  material  that  is  a  hazardous  waste,  the  shipper  may  assign  a tentative shipping name. A4.2.3.1.  Base the tentative PSN on: A4.2.3.1.1.  The defining criteria of the hazard class. A4.2.3.1.2.  The hazard precedence prescribed in A4.2.4. A4.2.3.1.3.  The shipper's knowledge of the material. A4.2.3.1.4.  A3.3.1.4 for new explosives. A4.2.3.2.  For a sample of a material other than a waste, the following must be met: A4.2.3.2.1.    Except  when  the  word  “Sample”  already  appears  in  the  proper  shipping name,  the  word  “Sample”  must  appear  as  part  of  the  proper  shipping  name  or  in association  with  the  basic  description  on  the  Shipper's  Declaration  for  Dangerous Goods; A4.2.3.2.2.  When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a  ""(star) in  Column (1) of Table A4.1, and the primary  constituent(s) for which the tentative classification  is  based  are  not  known,  the  provisions  requiring  a  technical  name  for the constituent(s) do not apply; and A4.2.3.2.3.  A sample must be transported in a combination packaging that conforms to the  requirements  of  this  manual  that  are  applicable  to  the  tentative  packing  group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per package. A4.2.4.  Precedence of Hazard. Assign any material specifically identified and listed in Table A4.1. the hazard class identified in column 3 of Table A4.1. Use other resources identified in A4.2.1. to determine the appropriate hazardous material description. If required, classify a  hazardous  material  that  is  not  specifically  identified  and  listed  in  Table  A4.1  (or  is  a mixture of materials), and meets  the definition of more than one hazard, according to the following order of precedence: A4.2.4.1.  Class 7 (Radioactive material, other than limited quantities and shipments of UN 3507,  Uranium  hexafluoride,  radioactive  material,  excepted  package).  When  limited quantities are involved the other hazardous properties take precedence. A4.2.4.2.  Class 1 (explosives). A4.2.4.3.  Class 2.3 (poisonous gas). A4.2.4.4.  Class 2.1 (flammable gas). See also Class 9.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       101 A4.2.4.5.  Class 2.2 (nonflammable gas). See also Class 9. A4.2.4.6.  Class 5.2 (organic peroxide). A4.2.4.7.  Class 6.2 (infectious substances). A4.2.4.8.  Class  4.1  (flammable  solid).  Only  self-reactive  substances  and  wetted explosives. A4.2.4.9.  Class  4.2  (substances  liable  to  spontaneous  combustion).  Only  pyrophoric substances. A4.2.4.10.  Class 6.1 (poisonous substances), PG I, poisonous by inhalation only. A4.2.4.11.  Small  quantities  of  compressed  gas  such  as  starter  fluid  (Class  2.1)  or  fire extinguisher  (Class  2.2)  installed  on  a  vehicle  do  not  take  precedence  over  the flammable liquid (Class 3). A4.2.4.12.  If required, classify other hazardous materials not identified above according to 49 CFR §173.2a. A4.2.5.  Hazard Classification of Class 5.2 Organic Peroxides. Class 5.2 organic peroxides are categorized  into  one  of  seven  "types"  in  a  system  of  generic  proper  shipping  names.  The generic  PSN  for  the  organic  peroxide  describes  the  physical  state  of  the  material  (i.e., liquid  or  solid),  provides  an  indication  of  controlled  temperature  requirements,  and includes  the  "type"  of  the  organic  peroxide.  The  seven  types  of  organic  peroxides  are described in Attachment 1. Transport all Class 5.2 material under one of the generic proper shipping names listed in Table A4.1. beginning with the words "ORGANIC PEROXIDE". Technical names are listed below each PSN in lower case letters. To determine the correct PSN: A4.2.5.1.  Find the technical name in Table A9.1. and select the UN identification number assigned  to  the  technical  name  that  best  describes  the  item  (in  terms  of  concentration ranges, physical characteristics, etc.). A4.2.5.2.  Turn  to  the  "ORGANIC  PEROXIDE"  listed  in  Table  A4.1.  These  entries constitute the "generic" organic peroxide proper shipping names. A4.2.5.3.  Match  the  UN  identification  number  for  the  technical  name  with  a  UN identification number associated with the generic PSN. A4.2.5.4.  The generic PSN associated with organic peroxides will include the "type" under which the organic peroxide falls. Organic peroxide types are defined in Attachment 1. A4.2.6.  Hazard Classification of Fissile  Materials. Except as provided in  A3.3.7.11. classify each package of fissile materials as fissile class I, II, or III. Determine the numerical values for package assignments as fissile class I, the transport indexes for fissile class II packages, and the conveyance limitations for fissile class III shipments according to 10 CFR Part 71. A4.2.6.1.  Fissile  Class  I.  Packages  may  be  transported  in  unlimited  numbers,  and  in  any arrangement,  and  require  no  nuclear  criticality  safety  controls  during  transportation.  A transport  index  is  not  assigned  to  fissile  class  I  packages  for  the  purpose  of  nuclear criticality safety control, although, the external radiation levels may require a transport index number.  102       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A4.2.6.2.  Fissile Class II. Packages may be transported together in any arrangement, but in numbers  that  are  not  over  an  aggregate  transport  index  of  50.  For  the  purposes  of nuclear criticality safety control, individual packages may have a transport index of not less than 0.1 and not more than 10. However, the external radiation levels may require a higher  transport  index  number.  These  shipments  require  no  nuclear  criticality  safety control by the shipper during transportation. A4.2.6.3.  Fissile Class III. Shipments of packages of fissile materials that do not meet the requirements of fissile class I or fissile class II and are controlled in transit as prescribed in Attachment 3 by appropriate arrangements between the shipper and the carrier. A4.3.  Determining Degree of Hazard (PG).  For most material, the PG is assigned in column 6 of Table A4.1. Packing groups I, II, and III indicate the degree of hazard associated with the materials  and  are  used  to  identify  the  severity  of  UN  specification  performance  tests associated  with  the  packaging  for  the  item.  Poisonous  by  inhalation  material  are  assigned hazard zones (see Attachment 1) in Table A4.1. If unknown, the PG or hazard zone may be determined  according  to  this  paragraph.  Hazard  Classes,  1,  2,  and  7  do  not  have  packing groups. A4.3.1.  Class 2 Hazard Zone. The hazard zone of a Class 2.3 material is given in column 7 of Table  A4.1.  When  column  7  of  Table  A4.1.  provides  more  than  one  hazard  zone  or  is blank,  determine  the  hazard  zone  from  Figure  A4.2.  There  are  no  hazard  zones  for  Class 2.1 and 2.2. Figure A4.2.  Determination of Hazard Zone for Class 2.3.  A4.3.2.  Class 3 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1. lists more than one PG for a material, or indicates  that  the  PG  is  to  be  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  PG  criteria  for  Class  3, determine the PG by using Figure A4.3. To use Figure A4.3., match the initial boiling point and  flash  point  of  the  material  to  the  corresponding  PG.  Flash  points  may  be  determined from the safety data sheet, the Hazardous Material Information Resource System (HMIRS), the  National  Fire  Protection  Guide,  or  markings  on  the  package.  For  example,  a  Class  3 material with an initial boiling point of 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) and a flash point of 25 degrees C (77 degrees F) would be assigned a PG III. If the initial boiling point is less than or equal to 35 degrees C (95 degrees F), assign PG I. Viscous Class 3 material (i.e., paints, varnishes, enamels, lacquers, adhesives, and polishes) in PG II with a flash point of  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       103 less than 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) may be grouped in PG III provided the requirements of 49 CFR §173.121(b) are met. Figure A4.3.  Criteria for Class 3 PG. A4.3.3.  Class 4 Packing Groups. When Table A4.1. indicates that the PG of the material is to be  determined  on  the  basis  of  test  criteria  for  Class  4  material,  the  test  methods  and appropriate criteria must comply with 49 CFR §173.125. A4.3.4.  Class 5 Packing Groups. When column 5 of Table A4.1. is blank for a solid in Class 5.1, determine the PG based on the test criteria found in 49 CFR §173.127. If column 5 is blank for a liquid in Class 5.1, packing groups can be assigned by a comparison to existing entries in Table A4.1. A4.3.5.  Class  6  Packing  Groups  and  Hazard  Zone.  When  Table  A4.1.,  column  5  provides more than one PG and hazard zone for a specific Class 6.1 material, determine the PG and hazard zone by applying the following criteria: A4.3.5.1.  Determine the PG assignment for other than inhalation of vapors by using Figure A4.4. A4.3.5.2.  Determine the PG and hazard zone assignments for inhalation of vapors by using Figure A4.5. Figure A4.4.  PG Assignment For Other Than Inhalation of Vapors.    104       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  Figure A4.5.  Inhalation Toxicity.  A4.3.5.3.  "V"  is  the  saturated  vapor  concentration  in  air  of  the  material  in  mL/m3  at  20 degrees C (68 degrees F) and standard atmospheric pressure. A4.3.5.4.  When the PG determined by Figure A4.4. and Figure A4.5. is different for two or  more  (oral,  dermal,  inhalation)  requirements,  the  PG  assigned  to  the  material  is  the highest degree of toxicity identified. A4.3.5.5.  Compute  the  PG  and  hazard  zone  for  Class  6.1  mixtures  that  are  poisonous (toxic) by inhalation as identified in 49 CFR §173.133(b). A4.3.6.  Class  8  Packing  Groups.  When  Table  A4.1.  lists  more  than  one  PG  for  a  material, determine the PG as follows: A4.3.6.1.  Packing Group  I. Substances that cause full thickness  destruction of intact  skin tissue within an observation period of up to 60 minutes starting after an exposure time of 3 minutes or less. A4.3.6.2.  Packing Group II. Substances that cause full thickness destruction of intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to  14 days starting after  an exposure time of more than 3 minutes, but not more than 60 minutes. A4.3.6.3.  Packing  Group  III.  Substances  are  assigned  to  Packing  Group  III  if  they  meet one of the following: A4.3.6.3.1.  Substances that cause full thickness  destruction of intact skin tissue within an observation period of up to 14 days starting after an exposure time of more than 60 minutes but less than 4 hours. A4.3.6.3.2.  Substances which are judged not to cause full thickness destruction of intact skin  tissue  but  which  exhibit  a  corrosion  rate  on  steel  or  aluminum  surfaces exceeding  6.25  mm  (1/4  inch)  a  year  at  a  test  temperature  of  55  degrees  C  (130 degrees F). A4.4.  Hazardous  Substances.  Table  A4.3.  identifies  materials  that  are  designated  hazardous substances  under  Section  101  (14)  of  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). See Attachment 1 for a detailed definition of a hazardous substance. Ensure review of Table  A4.3 to  determine if  a material  is  a hazardous substance.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       105 A4.4.1.  Determine  if  the  material  is  a  hazardous  substance  by  identifying  the  reportable quantity  (RQ)  in  Table  A4.3.  The  RQ  is  used  to  determine  if  material  is  a  hazardous substance.  The  material  is  a  hazardous  substance  if  the  amount  in  one  package  equals  or exceeds  the  RQ  quantity.  Table  A4.3.  specifies,  in  pounds  and  kilograms,  the  minimum quantity  of  the  material  that  constitutes  an  RQ.  For  example:  sodium  arsenate  (RQ-1.0/0.454) means the RQ is 1.0 pound or 0.454 kilograms. A4.4.2.  A substance or solution is a "hazardous substance" when the concentration by weight equals or exceeds the concentration listed in Figure A1.1. A4.4.3.  If  the  technical  name  of  the  hazardous  substance  appears  in  Table  A4.1.,  then  the technical name is the PSN. If the hazardous substance does not appear in Table A4.1. and is  not  a  forbidden  material,  select  an  appropriate  generic  (N.O.S.)  PSN.  Specify  the technical  name  in  parenthesis  after  the  PSN.  See  Attachment  17  for  certification requirements. A4.4.4.  For Radionuclides, see 49 CFR §172.101, Appendix A. A4.5.  Using  Table  A4.1.  Table  A4.1.  identifies  "hazardous  materials”  for  the  purpose  of military air transportation. To use  Table A4.1. locate the proper shipping name (PSN) of the hazardous material and follow the information identified on the same line with the PSN. Use Table  A4.1.  to  identify  the  following:  eligibility  of  material  for  shipment,  identification number,  proper  shipping  name  (PSN),  hazard  class  and  division,  subsidiary  risk,  packing group (PG), special provisions applicable to the material (including passenger eligibility), and packaging paragraph. A4.5.1.  Column 1: Symbols. Column 1 contains symbols that pertain to the PSN. A4.5.1.1.  The  letter  "D"  means  that  the  PSN  applies  only  to  domestic  shipments.  These items  are  also  identified  by  "NA"  numbers  in  column  4.  For  international  shipments, select an alternate PSN that is not preceded by a "D". A4.5.1.2.  The "" (star) identifies that a technical name is required in association with the PSN. A4.5.1.3.  The “+” (plus) fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and packing group for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the definition of that class or packing group or meets any other hazard class definition. A4.5.2.  Column 2: Identification Number. Column 2 lists the identification number assigned to each PSN. A4.5.2.1.  Ship items classified with "UN" or "ID" (identification) numbers domestically or internationally. A4.5.2.2.  Ship  items  classified  with  "NA"  (North  American)  numbers  domestically  only, or to and from Canada or Mexico. Use of “UN” numbers is preferred even for domestic shipment. A4.5.2.3.  New  or  revised  UN  or  NA  numbers  in  49  CFR  Part  172,  ICAO,  or  IATA  are recognized for use with this manual. A4.5.3.  Column 3: Proper Shipping Names (PSN). PSNs are listed alphabetically in all bold capital letters in Table A4.1. Use either singular or plural wording. New and revised PSNs  106       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  in 49 CFR Part 172, ICAO, or IATA are authorized PSNs under this manual, provided the packaging requirements do not change. Alternate accepted spelling may be used provided the  correct  associated  UN/ID  number  is  used  (e.g.,  “UN1350,  SULFUR”  vice  “UN1350, SULPHUR”). A PSN modifier which appears as lower case italicized letters are descriptive words which may be used, but are not required as part of the PSN. A4.5.3.1.  Technical  or  Chemical  Group  Names.  Provide  a  technical  or  chemical  group name in association with the PSN when required by an “” (star) in column 1. A4.5.3.1.1.  Organic  Peroxides.  Use  technical  names  listed  below  the  appropriate generic  PSN  (in  lower  case  letters)  in  Table  A4.1.  See  A4.2.5.  for  PSN  assignment based on technical name. A4.5.3.1.2.  Mixtures and Solutions. If the hazardous material is a mixture or solution of two  or  more  hazardous  materials,  enter  the  technical  names  of  at  least  two components most contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution in parentheses after the PSN. A4.5.3.2.  The Word "OR" in Table A4.1. The word "or" in a sequence of PSNs means that PSNs  in  the  sequence  are  synonymous.  Therefore,  use  of  any  one  of  the  PSNs  in  the series is  appropriate. Select  only one PSN in  the series when  classifying  the shipment. For Class 1 material, use the PSN listed in the JHCS. A4.5.3.3.  The Word "SEE" in Table A4.1. When one item references another item (by use of  the  word  "see")  and  both  names  are  in  capital  letters,  use  either  name  as  the  PSN. Forbidden designations and passenger restrictions applicable to the referenced entry also apply to the "see" entry. A4.5.3.4.  The Words “SOLUTION” or “MIXTURE”. A mixture or solution containing a hazardous  material  listed  by  name  in  Table  A4.1.  together  with  one  or  more  materials not subject to this manual must be identified by the PSN of the hazardous material. Add the qualifying word “solution” or “mixture” to the PSN. (See 49 CFR §172.101(c) (10)) A4.5.3.5.  Concentration Ranges. When a shipping name includes a concentration range as part  of  the  shipping  description,  the  actual  concentration  shipped  (if  it  is  in  the  range stated) may be used in place of the concentration range. For example, ship a hydrogen peroxide solution containing 30 percent peroxide as either "Hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide)" or "Hydrogen peroxide aqueous solution (with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide)." A4.5.3.6.  Hazardous Wastes. The PSN for a hazardous material that is a hazardous waste must  include  the  word  "WASTE"  preceding  the  name  of  the  material  (i.e.,  WASTE, ACETONE). Comply with all requirements of this manual identified for the hazardous material when shipped as waste. A4.5.4.  Column 4: Hazard Class/Division. Column 4 contains: A4.5.4.1.  Primary hazard class and division numbers. When this manual references hazard class,  that  includes  any  division  number  if  appropriate.  For  Class  1  (explosives),  the  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       107 compatibility  group class/divisions. is  also  given.  See  A4.2.  for  additional information  on A4.5.4.2.  Some  items  that  contain  explosive  material  may  be  assigned  to  a  classification other than Class 1 by DOD explosives hazard classification approval authorities due to the  predominant  hazard  (see  A3.3.4.4).  Compatibility  group  letters  assigned  to  non-Class 1 material do not apply to military air transportation. A4.5.5.  Column  5:  Subsidiary.  Column  5  identifies  the  hazard  class/division  of  any subsidiary risk posed by a material. Subsidiary risk may vary, depending on the applicable PG. A4.5.6.  Column  6:  Packing  Group  (PG).  Column  6  specifies  one  or  more  packing  groups assigned  to  each  PSN  and  hazard  class.  Hazard  classes  2,  7,  and  ORM-D  do  not  have packing groups. See A4.3. for additional information on PG. A4.5.7.  Column  7:  Special  Provisions.  Column 7  specifies  codes  for  special  provisions  that are  applicable  for  each  PSN,  hazard  class,  and  PG.  Special  provision  codes  may  vary, depending on the PG. Requirements of the special provision codes are identified in Table A4.2.  The  codes  reflect  four  categories:  numeric  codes,  codes  beginning  with  "A",  codes beginning with "N", and codes beginning with a “P”. A4.5.7.1.  Use codes beginning with  a “P” to determine passenger eligibility for transport with hazardous materials. A4.5.7.2.  Use  all  other  codes  to  determine  packaging  provisions,  restrictions,  and exceptions from requirements for particular quantities or forms of materials. A4.5.7.3.  When  an  additional  packaging  requirement  is  prescribed,  the  requirement  is mandatory. A4.5.8.  Column  8:  Packaging  Paragraph.  This  column  lists  the  applicable  packaging paragraph.  “FORBIDDEN”  items  are  also  identified  in  this  column.  Do  not  transport "FORBIDDEN" items by military aircraft unless waived IAW paragraph 2.3.1. A4.5.8.1.  Except  when  otherwise  identified,  prepare  hazardous  material  shipments according to the specified packaging paragraph. A4.5.8.2.  Packaging  paragraphs  in  each  attachment  provide  titles  as  a  guide  for  PSNs covered by that paragraph. These titles are a guide only and are not all-inclusive. A4.5.8.3.  If  a  packaging  paragraph  in  Table  A4.1.  specifies  packaging  that  is  not applicable to the form of the material (i.e., the packaging specified is for a solid material and  the  material  shipped  is  in  liquid  form)  use  the  following  guidance  to  select  the appropriate paragraph: A4.5.8.3.1.  Use  either  packaging  paragraph  A8.2.  for  liquids  or  A8.3.  for  solids  (as appropriate). A4.5.8.3.2.  Use  either  packaging  paragraph  A9.5.  for  liquids  or  A9.6.  for  solids  (as appropriate). A4.5.8.3.3.  Use  either  packaging  paragraph  A10.4.  for  liquids  or  A10.5.  for  solids  (as appropriate).  108       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A4.5.8.3.4.  Use  either  packaging  paragraph  A12.2.  for  liquids  or  A12.3.  for  solids  (as appropriate). Table A4.1.  Alphabetical Listing of Items.

Comply with the following handling instructions only when shipping items containing a fuel that is corrosive or toxic. A5.3.1.  Handling  Instructions.  Exercise  extreme  caution  in  handling  this  item.  Keep  well ventilated, away from sparks, fire hazards, and oxidizing materials. Vapors are toxic when inhaled.  Liquid  is  corrosive.  Fuel  in  presence  of  an  oxidizer  is  self-igniting  and  highly reactive.  Approved  protective  clothing,  gloves,  safety  goggles,  and  a  positive  pressure breathing  apparatus  must  be  available  during  handling  of  this  material,  and  worn  when handling leaking packages. A5.3.2.  Shipping Requirements. The following requirements apply: A5.3.2.1.  Load  containers  having  an  installed  indicator  in  such  a  manner  as  to  provide access  to  the  indicator  during  flight.  Inspect  the  indicator  before  aircraft  loading,  after aircraft  loading,  at  cruise  altitude,  during  flight  every  hour  or  as  required  by  the applicable  technical  manual,  as  cargo  tiedown  is  inspected,  and  after  landing.  The normal  color  of  the  indicator  is  white  or  off-white.  The  color  will  change  to  yellow  if inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA) leak occurs. The color will change to black if  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       247 an  amine  fuel  mixture  (AFM)  leak  occurs.  Changes  are  obvious  and  do  not  require technical escort personnel to monitor. A5.3.2.2.  Containers that do not have an indicator installed must be preplanned under the same conditions as described in paragraph 2.8. The shipper must contact the carrier no less than 72 hours before movement. The shipper must also furnish the following: A5.3.2.2.1.  Protective clothing, gloves, and a positive pressure breathing apparatus for all personnel aboard the aircraft (see also paragraph 1.9.). A5.3.2.2.2.  Fume-detecting equipment. A5.3.2.2.3.

A15.2.  Hazard Labels. A15.2.1.  Affix to the outer packaging or (overpack) a primary hazard label and a subsidiary risk  label(s)  (if  required)  based  on  the  hazard  classification/subsidiary  risk  provided  in columns  4  and  5  of  Table  A4.1.  unless  exempted  by  A15.4.  Include  the  hazard  class  or division  number in  the bottom  corner of the label(s).  Labels  that do not  have the class or division  number  preprinted  may  be  stamped  or  overprinted  with  the  appropriate  hazard class/ division number in the bottom corner of the label. A15.2.1.1.  For  explosives,  include  the  division  number  and  compatibility  group  letter. Ensure the compatibility group letter is a capitalized Roman letter. A15.2.1.2.  For  Division  5.1  oxidizers  and  Division  5.2  organic  peroxides,  include  the division number in the bottom corner of the label. A15.2.2.  Unless  otherwise  directed  in  this  manual,  attach  labels  to  the  part  of  the  package bearing  the  PSN  if  package  size  is  adequate.  If  package  size  is  not  adequate,  use  an overpack. Packages requiring a Radioactive Material label ("Category I-White", "Category II-Yellow" or "Category III-Yellow") will be labeled on opposite sides. A15.2.3.  Do not place labels over any identifying data on the container. Remove or obliterate any irrelevant labeling already on the packaging.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       415 A15.2.4.  When  hazardous  materials  are  placed  in  an  overpack,  the  appropriate  primary hazard label, subsidiary hazard label(s) and handling label(s) for each class must be applied to  the  outer  package  or  container.  If  the  primary  hazard  or  subsidiary  risk  label(s)  of another  component  of  the  overpack  already  adequately  identifies  a  primary  or  subsidiary risk it is not necessary to apply an additional label. A15.2.5.  When hazardous materials are palletized on a 463L or warehouse pallet, ensure the label is clearly visible. A15.2.6.  Position  hazardous  cargo  loaded  in  the  back  of  a  vehicle  so  the  labels  are  clearly visible,  or  apply  the  labels  for  each  hazard  loaded  in  the  back  of  the  vehicle  to  a  marker board that is clearly visible. A15.2.7.  Label  each  Limited  Quantity  package  for  each  dangerous  good  contained  in  the package. A15.2.8.  Excepted Quantities do not require hazard labels. See A19.2.3 for package marking requirements. A15.2.9.  Label  hazardous  waste  with  the  appropriate  hazard  label  and  properly  completed hazardous waste label. A15.2.10.  For items shipped under the PSN "Dangerous Goods in Machinery" or "Dangerous Goods in Apparatus" apply Package Orientation (This Way Up) labels to opposite vertical sides  when  required  to  ensure  liquid  hazardous  materials  remain  in  their  intended orientation. If machinery or apparatus contains a magnetized material apply both a Class 9 (Miscellaneous) and a "Magnetized Material" label. A15.2.11.  A label(s) is not required for domestic shipments when use is exempted by a DOT special permit. For international shipments, the correct label(s) must be applied. A15.2.12.  Do not apply hazard labels to a package containing material that is not regulated. A15.2.13.  Labels required by this attachment for individual packages will be applied directly to stretch or shrink wrapping used or to a marking board (A14.3.11). Orientation labels are not required if stretch or shrink wrap prevents incorrect loading of packages/containers. A15.3.  Handling Labels. A15.3.1.  Apply  a  "Cargo  Aircraft  Only"  label  on  packaging  (to  include  overpacks)  not permitted  on  passenger  aircraft  as  identified  in  column  7  of  Table  A4.1.  Also  apply  to marking boards according to A15.1.6., when applicable, if label is not visible. A15.3.2.  The  "Cargo  Aircraft  Only"  label  is  not  required  on  cargo  shipped  according  to A17.3  or  when  Chapter  3  of  this  Manual  is  authorized  unless  diverted  as  identified  in A17.3.5. A15.3.3.  Apply  a "Magnetized Material" label  on packages containing magnetized material. An  additional  Class  9  label  is  not  required.  Also  apply  to  marking  boards  according  to A15.1.6., when applicable, if label is not visible. A15.3.4.  Apply  an  "Empty"  label  when  the  packaging  meets  the  requirements  of  paragraph A3.1.16.  Any  container  or  cylinder  shipped  as  empty  must  have  the  previously  applied hazard  labels  removed,  obliterated,  destroyed,  or  completely  covered  by  the  "EMPTY"  416       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  label. New or reconditioned cylinders do not require an "Empty" label but must be marked or tagged to indicate they are empty. A15.3.5.  Apply  "Keep  Away  From  Heat"  label  to  each  outside  package  containing  self-reactive substances of Class/Division 4.1 or organic peroxides of Class/Division 5.2. A15.3.6.  Labels required by 49 CFR, ICAO, or IATA may be affixed even if not required by this manual. A15.3.7.  A  marking  board  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  applying  a  handling  label(s)  directly  to  a freight container (see A14.3.11). A15.4.  Labeling Requirements Applicable to Hazard Classes. A15.4.1.  Class  1.  Explosives  labels  will  be  applied  to  the  same  side  as  the  nomenclature markings if the Service approved SPI or drawing directs the PSN to be marked on the top of the shipping container. For unitized, containerized, or palletized loads of like items with the same hazard classification, division  and compatibility  group, only one of the required hazard label(s) must be applied and visible. A15.4.2.  Class 2. A15.4.2.1.  For packages containing oxygen, compressed; or oxygen, refrigerated liquid, a label  with  the  word  "OXYGEN"  may  be  used  in  place  of  a  label  with  the  word "OXIDIZER,"  if  the  letter  size  and  color  are  the  same  as  those  required  for  oxidizer. Alternatively,  an  "OXYGEN"  label  may  be  used  in  place  of  the  "NONFLAMMABLE GAS" and "OXIDIZER" labels required in Table A4.1. A15.4.2.2.  Recoil mechanisms or artillery gun mounts prepared and certified according to A6.5.13.,  must  have  a  nonflammable  compressed  gas  label  applied  to  each  exterior container.  However,  when  shipped  as  an  integral  part  of  the  complete  weapon  system, the nonflammable compressed gas label may be on the weapon or its exterior cover. A15.4.3.  Class 3. All  flammable liquids, whose vapor pressure (Reid  test) is  more than 110 kPa (16 psi) at 38 degrees C (100 degrees F), must have a "white bung label," 76 x 127 mm (3 by 5 inches), affixed near the bung or closure of the container. A15.4.4.  Class 4. A division 4.1 subsidiary hazard label is not required on a package bearing a division 4.2 label. A15.4.5.  Class 6. A15.4.5.1.  Label  PG  I  or  II  material  with  either  a  "TOXIC"  or  "TOXIC  INHALATION HAZARD" label as appropriate. A15.4.5.2.  Label hazard zone A or B material with a "TOXIC INHALATION HAZARD" label. A15.4.5.3.  Material classified as an infectious substance, that also meets the definition of a Class 2.3 toxic material or a radioactive material, must also be labeled with a "TOXIC GAS" (or INHALATION HAZARD) label or "RADIOACTIVE" label as appropriate.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       417 A15.4.5.4.  Label all Category A infectious substance packagings with an "INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE" label. A15.4.6.  Class 7. A15.4.6.1.  Hazard  Label.  Each  package  requiring  a  "RADIOACTIVE"  label  must  have two of these labels affixed to opposite sides of the package. The proper label to affix to a package  of  radioactive  material  is  based  on  the  radiation  level  at  the  surface  of  the package and the transport index. The proper category of label is determined according to Table A15.1. The first step is to determine the maximum radiation level at a distance of 1  meter  from  the  external  surfaces  of  the  package,  overpack  or  freight  container,  the value determined must be multiplied by 100. The final step is the figure obtained in step 1 must be rounded up to the first decimal place, except that a value of 0.05 or less may be  considered  as  zero.  Apply  the  highest  category  label  required  for  any  of  the  two determining  conditions.  Radioactive  Category  I-White  is  the  lowest  category  and Category III-Yellow is the highest. For example: a package with a transport index of 0.8 and a maximum surface radiation level of 0.6 mSv/h (60 mrem/h) must bear a Category III-Yellow label (see Table A15.1.) Table A15.1.  Radioactive Label Requirements. (See Note 1).  Transport Index (TI) Maximum Radiation Level at any Point on the External Surface  Label Category (see Note 1) I - White II - Yellow Less than or equal to 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) More than 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) but less than or equal to 0.5 mSv/h (50 mrem/h) More than 0.5 mSv/h (50 mrem/h) but less than or equal to 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) More than 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) but less than or equal to 10 mSv/h (1000 mrem/h) III - Yellow III – Yellow  0 (see Note 2) More than 0 but not more than 1 (see Note 2) More than 1 but not more than 10 More than 10 (see Note 3) NOTES: 1.  The category of label must be shown in  Key  17 of the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods  form  and  must  also  be  applied  to  radioactive  materials  packages.  Any  package containing a "highway route controlled quantity" must be labeled as radioactive Category III-Yellow. 2.  If the measured TI is not greater than 0.05, the value quoted may be zero. 3.   If  the  TI  is  greater  than  10,  the  package  or  overpack  must  be  transported  by  SAAM  airlift only (see Attachment 24) A15.4.6.2.  Subsidiary Risk Label. Label each package containing a radioactive material that also  meets  the  definition  of  one  or  more  additional  hazards,  as  required  by  this attachment for the radioactive material and for each additional hazard. For example, label  418       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  solid  nitrates  of  uranium  or  thorium,  "RADIOACTIVE"  and  "OXIDIZER."  Subsidiary risk labels are not required for an uncompressed gas that is non-flammable and non-toxic. A15.4.6.3.  Label  Marking.  The  contents,  activity,  and  for  Category  II  and  III  yellow labels,  the transport index must  be marked on the label. Additionally, the CSI must be marked on the CSI label. Enter the following information in the blank spaces by legible printing (manual or mechanical), using a durable weather resistant means of marking: A15.4.6.3.1.  Contents. Mark the contents as follows: A15.4.6.3.1.1.  Except for LSA-I material, the symbol of the radionuclide as listed in to  established  radiation  protection that  conform Table  A11.1.  Symbols terminology are authorized, (i.e., 99Mo, 60Co, etc). A15.4.6.3.1.2.  For  mixtures  of individual radionuclides  packed  together  in  the  same  package,  the  most  restrictive radionuclides must be listed to the extent that space on the line permits. radionuclides,  or for  different A15.4.6.3.1.3.  LSA  (except  LSA-1)  or  SCO  must  have  the  symbol  of  the radionuclide followed by “LSA-II”, “LSA-III”, “SCO-I”, “SCO-II” as appropriate.  A15.4.6.3.1.4.  For LSA-I material, only “LSA-I” is required to be marked. A15.4.6.3.2.  Activity.  Express  units  in  appropriate  international  units  of  Becquerels (Bq)  or  Terabecquerels  (TBq).  The  customary  units,  i.e.,  curies  (Ci),  millicuries (mCi),  or  microcuries  (uCi)  may  be  included  in  parenthesis  following  the international units. Abbreviations are authorized. For a fissile material, the weight in grams or kilograms of the fissile radioisotope also may be inserted. A15.4.6.3.3.  Transport Index (TI). For Category II and Category III yellow labels only, the  Transport  Index  must  be  marked  in  the  box  provided.  It  must  be  rounded  up  to one decimal place (see Attachment 1). A15.4.6.3.4.  Criticality Safety Index (CSI). A15.4.6.3.4.1.  The  Criticality  Safety  Index  label  must  be  marked  with  the  CSI  as stated  in  the  certificate  of  approval  for  special  arrangement  or  the  certificate  of approval  for  the  package  design,  issued  by  the  NRC  or  the  US  Competent Authority, in the box provided. A15.4.6.3.4.2.  For overpacks and freight containers, the CSI on the label is the sum of the criticality safety indexes of the individual packages in the freight container or overpack as stated in the certificate of approval for the package design issued by the NRC or the US Competent Authority. A15.4.6.3.5.  Overpacks  and  Freight  Containers.  When  one  or  more  packages  of radioactive material are placed within an overpack, the overpack must be labeled as prescribed in this paragraph except as follows: A15.4.6.3.5.1.  The content entry on the label may state “See Shipper’s Declaration” in place of the names of the radionuclides unless each inside package contains the same radionuclide(s).  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       419 A15.4.6.3.5.2.  The activity entry on the label must be determined by adding together the  number  of  becquerals  of  the  radioactive  materials  packages  contained  in  the overpack. A15.4.6.3.5.3.  For  an  overpack,  the  TI  must  be  determined  by  adding  together  the transport indexes of the radioactive materials packages contained in the overpack. For  a  rigid  overpack,  the  TI  may  alternatively  be  determined  by  direct measurement  as  prescribed  in  this  paragraph;  however,  it  must  be  taken  by  the person  who  initially  offered  the  packages  contained  within  the  overpack  for shipment. A15.4.6.3.5.4.  The  category  of  Class  7  label  for  the  overpack  must  be  determined from  Table  A15.1.  using  the  TI  derived  from  the  requirements  in  this  paragraph and the maximum surface radiation level on the surface of the overpack. A15.4.6.3.5.5.  The category of the Class 7 label of the overpack and not that of any contained  packages  must  be  used  in  accordance  with  Table  1  of  49  CFR §172.504(e) to determine when the transport vehicle must be placarded. A15.4.7.  Class 8. A15.4.7.1.  Wet-cell  batteries  prepared  and  certified  according  to  A12.4.  must  have "Package Orientation" labels indicating the upright position (top) of the container, if not already marked on the container as specified in A14.3.6. A15.4.7.2.  Label Chemical or First Aid Kits prepared in accordance with A12.6. with the primary hazard label and any subsidiary risk labels applicable to each individual hazard within the kit. A15.4.7.3  Packages displaying a Class 8 label need not display a Division 6.1 subsidiary hazard label if the toxicity of the material is based solely on the corrosive destruction of tissue rather than systematic poisoning. A15.4.8.  Class 9. A15.4.8.1.  Vehicles  and  equipment  do  not  require  a  label  unless  packaged,  crated,  or otherwise enclosed to prevent ready identification. A15.4.8.2.  Certify  items  containing  both  limited  quantity  radioactive  and  magnetic characteristics to the radioactive material. Although limited quantity radioactive material is  exempt  from  labeling,  a  magnetic  material  label  must  be  applied  to  the  shipping container.  420       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  Attachment 16 AREA PLACARDING A16.1.  General  Requirements.  Placard transporting  any hazardous materials when parked according to Table A16.1. or Service directives. If Service directives do not contain specific procedures for placarding, use the following guidance: the  area  surrounding  aircraft A16.1.1.  Use placards that meet the general design, size, and color specifications of 49 CFR §172.519. A16.1.2.  For  explosives,  fire  and  chemical  hazard  symbols  specified  in  DOD  6055.9-STD may be used in place of placards. A16.1.3.  Conspicuously  display  placards  at  the  front,  rear,  and  both  sides  of  the  aircraft unless emergency response access is restricted. Then post placards at entry points. A16.1.4.  Park aircraft transporting DOD Class 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 explosives and any material identified as Inhalation hazard zone A in a remote area. Placarding is still required for these materials when parked in a designated restricted, posted, and traffic controlled parking or loading and unloading area. A16.1.5.  Park aircraft transporting all other types of hazardous materials in a placarded area. However,  placarding  is  not  required  for  these  materials  when  parked  in  a  designated restricted, posted, and traffic controlled parking or loading and unloading area. A16.2.  Responsibility for Placards. A16.2.1.  Military hosts are responsible for placarding at military bases. A16.2.2.  At  nonmilitary  airfields,  the  agency  delivering  cargo  to  the  aircraft,  or  off  loading cargo is responsible for making arrangements with the airport manager for identifying the cargo,  isolating  parking  and  loading,  placarding,  firefighting,  and  disaster  response. Arrangements  for  using  en  route  nonmilitary  airfields  is  the  responsibility  of  the  activity having operational control of the aircraft. A16.2.3.  It  is  the shipping activity's responsibility  to  establish procedures to  locally procure and fund for hazardous material placards. A16.2.4.  The nomenclature of the placards is shown in Table A16.1.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       421 Table A16.1.

Use the explosive placard representing highest hazard. For example, if the area contains both Class 1.1 and 1.2, use the Explosive 1.1 placard. Otherwise, placard for each hazard or comply with note 3 below. 2.  The aggregate gross weight is the total gross weight of the compatible packages comprising the shipment or different shipments of the same classification. 3.  For those hazard classes located in the lower portion of the table, placarding is not required if the aggregate gross weight of the packages of those classes is less than 454 kg (1001 pounds). A  422       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  "DANGEROUS" placard may be used in place of the separate placards for two or more categories of hazardous material found in the lower portion of the table. When 1000 kg (2205 pounds) or more of one category of material from the lower portion of the table is loaded, the specific placard for that material is required, and a "DANGEROUS" placard may not be used to represent that material.    AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       423 Attachment 17 CERTIFYING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS A17.1.  Shipper's  Certification.  Unless  specifically  exempted  in  this  manual,  the  shipping activity must complete a shipper's certification according to this attachment for all military air shipments of hazardous materials. A17.1.1.  Certifying Official. A17.1.1.1.  An  individual  qualified  according  to  A25.3.  must  inspect  the  hazardous materials prior to accomplishing the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form. A17.1.1.2.  When  transportation  personnel  are  required  to  certify  an  item  that  requires special  preparation  (munitions,  engines,  etc),  the  item  specialist  or  preparing  activity will  provide  documentation  indicating  that  the  item  is  prepared  properly  for  air shipment. Develop local procedures to determine acceptable documentation. A17.1.2.  Certification  Reference.  Certify  hazardous  materials  to  a  packaging  reference  in this  manual.  Hazardous  material  may  be  certified  as  required  for  air  transport  to  the ICAO, IATA, or Title 49 CFR under the following conditions:  A17.1.2.1. Comply with all requirements of the certifying document. A17.1.2.2.  Certified  on  a  "Shipper's  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods"  standard commercial form. A17.1.2.3. Materials prepared passenger/cargo aircraft will be assigned P5. A17.1.2.4. Materials prepared cargo aircraft only will be assigned P4. A17.1.2.5. See A17.2.6. for multiple mode shipments. A17.2.  Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods Certification. A17.2.1.  Forms Required. Complete shipper's certification on the "Shipper's Declaration  for Dangerous Goods" standard commercial form. Two styles of the commercial form may be used.  One  style  is  designed  with  the  "Nature  and  Quantity  of  Dangerous  Goods"  section left open for continuous printing. The other style is designed in a columnar format with the "Nature  and  Quantity  of  Dangerous  Goods"  section  blocked  and  formatted  with  headings specifying  each  key  entry  (Figure  A17.1.).  It  is  the  shipping  activity's  responsibility  to establish  procedures  to  locally  procure  and  fund  for  the  Shipper’s  Declaration  for Dangerous Goods form. A17.2.1.1.  Obtain  the  form  through  the  procurement  system  from  commercial  vendors specializing in hazardous material transportation supplies. A17.2.1.2.  The  form  may  be  locally  produced  depending  on  local  capabilities  and economic feasibility. A17.2.1.3.  The  form  must  meet  the  format,  size,  and  color  specifications  outlined  in IATA, Section 8-Documentation. A17.2.2.  Copies  Required.  Complete  and  sign  at  least  three  Shipper’s  Declaration  for Dangerous Goods forms.  424       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A17.2.2.1.  Attach one certification form to the copy of the manifest that  is placed on the aircraft. A17.2.2.2.  Attach one certification form to the originating station file manifest. Intransit or enroute terminals  may  reproduce (photocopy) the Shipper’s Declaration for Dangerous Goods form for their station file if required. A17.2.2.3.  Place one certification form in a waterproof envelope and attach to the number one piece of the shipment. A17.2.2.4.  The  three  original  forms  used  to  offer  hazardous  material  for  military  air transportation must have the vertical red hatch border and certifying official’s signature. Carbon signatures are acceptable. A17.2.2.5.  Additional  copies  may  be  forwarded  with  the  shipment.  Vertical  red  hatch border is not required for any additional copies. A17.2.3.  Form  Completion.  Complete  the  Shipper's  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods  form either  manually  (hand  printed),  mechanically  (typewriter),  or  digitally  (computer).  The form  may  be  completed  by  a  combination  of  manual,  mechanical,  and  digital  means,  as required, providing all entries are clear and legible. However, when possible, the shipping activity  should  complete  the  form  entirely  manually,  mechanically,  or  digitally.  Incorrect punctuation,  spelling  (other  than  Proper  Shipping  Name),  or  entries  that  touch  column separating lines on the form is not justification for frustrating hazardous cargo. Entries may be either in upper or lower case or combination. A17.2.3.1.  Use  Table  A17.1.  for  detailed  instructions  on  accomplishing  the  shipper’s certification  form  for  nonradioactive  and  radioactive  shipments.  Use  Table  A17.2.  to determine  if  a  Shipper's  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods  is  required  for  radioactive shipments. A17.2.3.1.1.  For  forms  with  the  "Nature  and  Quantity  of  Dangerous  Goods"  in columnar  format,  enter  information  in  the  appropriate  column  according  to  Table A17.1. A17.2.3.1.2.  For  forms  with  the  "Nature  and  Quantity  of  Dangerous  Goods"  open  for continuous  printing,  enter  the  basic  description according  to  Table  A17.1. Example: "UN2744, Cyclobutyl chloroformate, 6.1 (8,3), PG II." A17.2.3.1.3.  For  forms  with  the  "Nature  and  Quantity  of  Dangerous  Goods"  open  for continuous  printing,  use  two  oblique  strokes,  i.e.  "//",  to  separate  sequences  of information or place each sequence on a separate line. Separate information within a sequence with a comma. See Figure A17.1. to identify separation of each sequence. A17.2.3.2.  Hazardous  materials  with  different  proper  shipping  names/UN  numbers  will not  be  shipped  under  the  same  transportation  control  number  (TCN).  Complete  a Shipper’s  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods  according  to  this  attachment  to  identify each proper shipping name/UN number identified by the TCN (see A17.4.2. and A17.3. for  exceptions).  A  single  Shipper’s  Declaration  for  Dangerous  Goods  will  be  used  for multiple like items shipped under one TCN.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       425 A17.2.3.3.  The  certifying  official  may  make  pen  and  ink  changes  to  any  key.  Someone other than the certifying official may make pen and ink changes to Keys 1 (only to the telephone  number  and  not  to  the  address),  2,  3,  5,  8,  9,  and  19  without  affecting  the certification.

General  Requirements.  For  military  members,  failure  to  obey  the  mandatory provisions  from  paragraphs  A18.2  through  A18.4  and  any  provisions  of  mandatory subparagraph(s)  hereunder  is  a  violation  of  Article  92,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice (UCMJ). Civilian employees who fail to  obey the provisions from  paragraph A18.2 through A18.4  and  any  provisions  of  mandatory  subparagraph(s)  hereunder  are  subject  to administrative  disciplinary  action  without  regard  to  otherwise  applicable  criminal  or  civil sanctions. Personnel shall follow specific segregation /compatibility and deviation instructions for movement of hazardous cargo via military airlift. Packages containing hazardous materials that might react dangerously with one another must not be loaded or transported in a position that  would  allow  interaction  between  the  material  in  the  event  of  leakage.  Segregation requirements for hazardous material on military aircraft identified in Table A18.1. and Table A18.2. must be used to determine segregation requirements. A18.1.1.  Table A18.1. details segregation requirements for all hazardous materials. A18.1.2.  Table A18.2. specifies compatibility requirements for Class 1. A18.1.3.  Paragraph A18.4. specifies compatibility requirements for tactical and contingency operations under the authority of Chapter 3. A18.2.  Segregation  Requirements  for  All  Hazardous  Materials.  Table  A18.1  indicates  the explosives  and  other  hazardous  materials  that  must  not  be  loaded,  transported,  or  stored together. A18.2.1.  Only  the  primary  hazard  class  or  division  are  considered  for  segregation. Subsidiary-risks  and  secondary  hazards  will  not  be  used  to  determine  segregation requirements when using Table A18.1. A18.2.2.  The  absence  of  any  hazard  class  or  a  blank  space  in  the  table  indicates  that  no restrictions apply. A18.2.3.  The  letter  "X"  at  an  intersection  of  horizontal  and  vertical  columns  indicates  that these  articles  must  not  be  loaded,  transported  ,  or  stored  together.  For  example,  in  Table A18.1.,  Class  3  flammable  liquids,  must  not  be  loaded,  transported,  or  stored  with  Class 1.1. A18.2.4.  The  letter  "O"  at  an  intersection  of  horizontal  and  vertical  columns  indicates  that these articles must not be loaded together unless separated by a 463L pallet position or not less than a distance of 2.2 m (88 inches) in all directions. For example, Class 8 corrosive liquids loaded on a 463L pallet, must not be transported with Class 4.1 flammable solids on an  adjoining  pallet.  If  loaded  in  a  logistic  rail  mode  (e.g.,  C-17),  these  items  must  be separated by 2.2 m (88 inches) and located on different pallets. A18.2.5.  The  "*"  at  an  intersection  of  horizontal  and  vertical  columns  indicates  that segregation among different Class 1 materials is identified in Table A18.2. A18.2.6.  Be sure to check notes for compatibility.  448       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A18.3.  Segregation  Requirements  for  Class  1  Materials.  Table  A18.2.  identifies  Class  1 materials that must not be loaded, transported, or stored together. A18.3.1.  A blank space in the table indicates that no restrictions apply. A18.3.2.  The letter "X" at an intersection of horizontal and vertical columns shows that these articles must not be loaded or stored together. For example, do not load or store Class 1.2C with Class 1.2H. A18.3.3.  Unless  otherwise  authorized,  do  not  pack  explosives  in  the  same  outer  packaging with other articles. Explosives of the same compatibility group or authorized combination of compatibility groups but a different class number may be packed together, provided that the whole package is treated as though its entire contents were comprised of the lower class number (higher hazard). For example, treat a mixed package of Class 1.2D explosives and Class  1.4D  explosives  as  Class  1.2D  explosives.  However,  when  Class  1.5D  is  packed together with Class 1.2D, treat the whole package as Class 1.1D (for compatibility). A18.3.4.  Incompatible  explosives  may  be  packed  together  when  approved  according  to  TB 700-2/  NAVORDINST  8020.8B/TO  11A-1-47/DLAR  8220.1,  DOD  Explosive  Hazard Classification Procedures or paragraph 2.3.2. A18.3.5.  Subsidiary-risks  will  not  be  used  to  determine  compatibility  requirements  when using Table A18.2. A18.3.6.  Be sure to check notes for compatibility. A18.4.  Chapter  3  Segregation/Compatibility.  The  requirements  of  Table  A18.1.  and  Table A18.2.  may  be  deviated  from  when  transporting  cargo  approved  to  be  airlifted  using provisions  of  Chapter  3,  consistent  with  operational  requirements.  Normally  incompatible hazardous materials may be transported on the same aircraft when separated to the maximum extent 3 segregation/compatibility, to include complete round rigging, for exercises only when there is an intent to use or fire explosives and ammunition. The following restrictions are mandatory: possible.  Compatibility  waivers required.  Use  Chapter are not A18.4.1.

Packing groups are not used for this hazard class. 2.  For inner packaging, the quantity contained in each receptacle must not exceed a water capacity of 30 ml. For outer packaging, the sum of the water capacities of all the inner packaging must not exceed 1 L. 3.  Applies only to organic peroxides when contained in a chemical kit or a first aid kit. 4.  Class 8, UN1774, UN2794, UN2795, UN2800, UN2803, UN2809, UN3028 and UN3477 are not permitted in excepted quantities. 5.  For Class 9 material, if no PG is given in Table A4.1., PG II quantities must be used. A19.2.3.  Inner Packaging. Each inner packaging must be plastic (with a minimum thickness of 0.2  mm),  glass,  earthenware,  or  metal.  The  inner  packaging  must  not  react  with,  or  be decomposed by, the material contained therein.  456       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A19.2.4.  Closures. Closures must be held securely, tightly, and effectively in place with tape, self-shrink plastic, wire, or other positive means. A19.2.5.  Liquids.  Liquids  must  not  completely  fill  inner  packaging  at  a  temperature  of  55 degrees C (130 degrees F). A19.2.6.  Intermediate  Packaging.  Securely  pack  each  inner  packaging  in  an  intermediate packaging with cushioning material. The intermediate packaging must completely contain the contents in case of breakage or leakage, regardless of packaging orientation. For liquid hazardous material, the intermediate packaging must contain sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of the inner packaging. A19.2.7.  Outer Packaging. Securely pack the intermediate packaging in a strong, rigid, outer packaging (i.e., fiberboard, wood). A19.2.8.  Overpacks.  Overpacks  may  be  used  and  may  contain  packages  of  nonhazardous material. All material in the same outer packaging and overpack must be compatible. A19.2.9.  Dimensions  of  Outer  Package.  Two  of  three  outside  dimensions  of  the  outer package must measure at least 100 mm (4 inches). If the outer package is in the shape of a cylinder, it must have a minimum height and diameter of 100 mm (4 inches) each. A19.2.10.  Other  Hazardous  Materials  and  Materials  in  Excepted  Quantities.  A  package containing  hazardous  material  in  excepted  quantities  must  not  contain  other  hazardous material that are regulated by this manual (requires a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods). A19.2.11.  Different  Materials  in  One  Outer  Packaging.  When  different  hazardous  materials are  contained  in  one  outer  packaging,  use  the  formula  listed  below  to  determine  the quantities  that  can  be  included  in  one  outer  packaging.  The  quantities  of  different hazardous materials contained in each outer packaging must be such that "Q" is less than or equal to 1.0, "Q" is calculated using the formula:      nl/Ml + n2/M2 + n3/M3 . . . = Q     (nl, n2, etc. is the actual net quantity of each different hazardous material. Ml, M2, etc. is the maximum net quantity permitted for the material and packing group in the outer packaging according to Table A19.1.) For example: A19.2.11.1.  There  are  15  inner  packages  at  20  ml  each  of  Class  3,  PG  II  ,  and  5  inner packages at 30 ml each of Class 8, PG II in  one outer packaging: 300 ml/500 ml + 150 ml/500 ml = 0.6 + 0.3 = 0.9. The result is less than 1.0, so the material can be shipped in one outer packaging. A19.2.11.2.  There  are  5  inner  packages  at  30  ml  each  of  Class  3,  PG  II,  and  15  inner packages  at  30  g  each  of  Class  8,  PG  II  in  one  outer  packaging:  150  ml/500  ml  +  450 g/500 g = 0.3 + 0.9 = 1.2. The result is greater than 1.0, so the item cannot be shipped in one outer packaging. A19.2.12.  Package  Performance  Tests.  The  complete  package  (inner  plus  outer  packaging), must  be  capable  of  withstanding  the  test  specified  in  A19.2.12.1.  without  breakage  or  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       457 leakage  of  the  inner  packaging  and  without  significant  reduction  in  effectiveness.  Tests must  be  carried  out  on  the  packaging  prepared  as  for  transport.  Inner  receptacles  must contain at least 95 percent of their capacity for solids and 98 percent of their capacity for liquids.  The  material  to  be  transported  in  the  packaging  may  be  replaced  by  another material, except where this would invalidate the results of the tests. When another material is  substituted  for  a  solid,  the  material  must  have  the  same  physical  characteristics  (i.e., mass, grain size) as the material to be shipped. When another material is substituted in the drop test for liquids, its relative density (specific gravity) and viscosity shall be similar to the material to be shipped. A19.2.12.1.  For  packaging  with  six  sides  (i.e.,  fiberboard  box),  the  following  free  drops onto a solid, unyielding, flat, and horizontal surface from 1.8 m (6 feet) is required. Each test may be performed on different but identical containers. A19.2.12.1.1.  One drop flat on the bottom. A19.2.12.1.2.  One drop flat on the top. A19.2.12.1.3.  One drop flat on the long side. A19.2.12.1.4.  One drop flat on the short side. A19.2.12.1.5.  One drop on a corner at the junction of three intersecting edges. A19.2.12.2.  For  cylindrical  packaging,  the  following  free  drops  onto  a  solid,  unyielding flat and horizontal surface from 1.8 m (6 feet) is required: A19.2.12.2.1.  One drop diagonally on the top chime with the center of gravity directly above the point of impact. A19.2.12.2.2.  One drop diagonally on the base chime. A19.2.12.2.3.  One drop flat on the side. A19.2.12.3.  A force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 hours, equivalent to the weight  of  identical  packages  if  stacked  to  a  height  of  3  m  (10  feet),  including  the  test sample. A19.2.13.  Package  Marking.  Excepted  quantities  of  hazardous  materials  packaged,  marked, and otherwise offered and transported in  accordance with  this  paragraph  must be durably and legibly marked with the following marking: Figure A19.1.  Excepted Quantity Package Marking   458       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  A19.2.13.1.

General  Requirements.  Ensure  all  of  the  packaging  materials  are  not  capable  of reacting  adversely  with  the  contents  of  the  package  and  are  noncombustible.    Do  not  use asbestos. A20.1.1.  The absorbent materials, cushioning, and closures must be the same or greater than the type and quantities specified in the applicable test report.  A20.2.  Cushioning  Requirements.    Inner  packagings  of  combination  packagings  must  be  so packed,  secured  and  cushioned  to  prevent  their  breakage  or  leakage  and  to  control  their shifting  within  the  outer  packaging  under  conditions  normally  incident  to  transportation.  Cushioning  material  must  not  be  capable  of  reacting  dangerously  with  the  contents  of  the inner  packagings  or  having  its  protective  properties  significantly  weakened  in  the  event  of leakage.  A20.2.1.  When  overpacking  individual  packagings  for  consolidation  that  already  meet  air-eligibility  requirements,  secure  and  position  the  packagings  against  damage  using appropriate means. A20.3.    Closures.    The  body  and  closure  of  any  packaging  must  be  constructed  to  be  able  to adequately  resist  the  effects  of  temperature  and  vibration  occurring  in  conditions  normally incident to air transportation.  Inner packaging or receptacle closures of combination packages containing liquids must be held securely, tightly and effectively in place by secondary means.  Examples  of  such  secondary  methods  include:  Adhesive  tape,  friction  sleeves,  welding  or soldering, locking wires, locking rings, induction heat seals, and child-resistant closures.  The closure device must be designed so that it is unlikely that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed.  Closures must be as follows: A20.3.1.  Packing Group I.  An inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Group I must have a secondary means of closure applied, and must be packed in accordance with A20.4.   A20.3.2.  Packing Groups II and III.  When a secondary means of closure cannot be applied or is impracticable to apply to an inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Groups II and III, this requirement may be satisfied by securely closing the inner packaging and placing it in a leakproof liner or bag before placing the inner packaging in its outer packaging.  A20.4.  Absorbent materials.  Comply with the specific packing instructions which may require absorbent  materials  for  certain  materials  and  packaging  configurations.    Packing  Group  I liquid hazardous materials of Classes 3, 4, or 8, or Divisions 5.1 or 6.1 that are packaged in combination  packagings  and  offered  for  air  transport  in  glass,  earthenware,  plastic,  or  metal inner packagings must be packed using absorbent material as follows: A20.4.1.  Inner packagings must be packed in a rigid and leakproof receptacle or intermediate packaging containing sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents of all inner packagings before packing the inner packaging(s) in the outer package. A20.4.2.  Absorbent material must not react dangerously with the liquid.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       463 A20.4.3.  For  single  or  composite  packagings  that  have  met  the  UN  packaging  specification test  requirements  (including  the  hydrostatic  pressure  test),  absorbent  material  is  not required.  A20.4.4.  Determining the amount of absorbent required.  Absorption capacity varies based on material  and  design,  reference  absorbent  specification  data  to  determine  absorption capacity for specific material used. Use Table A20.1 as a guide to determine the amount of absorbent  material  required.    Absorbent  materials  other  than  those  listed  in  the  table  are authorized as long as they meet the absorbent requirement.  A20.4.4.1.  The amounts identified in Table A20.1  are the minimum requirements. When exact  quantities  of  absorbent  materials  are  not  found  in  Table  A20.1,  make  an approximation based on quantities listed. A20.4.4.2    When  the  applicable  test  report  or  packing  instruction  identifies  an  amount larger than Table A20.1, use the larger amount. A20.4.4.3.  When placing loose-fill materials (e.g., vermiculite) into the container, consider settling of the loose-fill materials during transportation. Use enough loose-fill material, and firmly tamp to compensate for any settling that may occur. A.20.4.5.  Absorbent materials should not be used as cushioning or to secure inner packagings so as to prevent breakage or leakage, or to control inner packaging shifting within the outer packaging under conditions normally incident to transportation.      Table A20.1.  Absorbent Material Requirements.

Passenger prohibition code "P2" applies. A24.3.  Technical  Escorts.  Furnish  technical  escorts  when  service  regulations  (or  cargo clearance  arrangements)  require  it,  or  when  the  shipping  activity's  medical  or  flight  safety personnel dictate. The shipping activity must initiate action to furnish the qualified personnel, when  they  are  required.  They  must  also  furnish  technical  escorts  or  other  personnel  to accompany shipments of infectious substances (etiologic agents) or plant quarantine materials per A10.8. When the shipping activity is  required to  furnish  qualified personnel,  it will also initiate action to furnish all required protective clothing and equipment for crew members, in addition  to  the  appropriate  decontamination,  detection,  and  emergency  first-aid  equipment. The  escort  has  complete  jurisdiction  over  the  cargo  as  it  pertains  to  normal  security,  safety, protection  of  personnel,  repair,  and  disposal  of  containers.  However,  in  the  following situations, escort authorities are primarily technical advisors, and are subordinate to: A24.3.1.  The aircraft commander in matters of flight operations and safety. A24.3.2.  The base installation commander in matters affecting the safety and mission of the command. A24.4.  Shipping Documents for Infectious Substances.  As indicated in A3.3.6.2.9, personnel must  ensure  all  necessary  transfer  documents  required  by  the  42  CFR,  7  CFR,  9  CFR,  and applicable  biosurety  regulations  are  appropriately  signed  and  emplaced  prior  to  transport  of Infectious Substances. Both the shipper and the receiver must ensure advanced arrangements are made prior to transfer/transport of samples and that all necessary import/export permits are obtained  prior  to  transport  of  infectious  substances.  An  etiologic  agent  and  plant  quarantine material  shipment  record  must  accompany  all  shipments  of  infectious  substances  (etiologic agents)  transported  under  the  provisions  of  this  attachment.  The  consignor  (shipper)  must prepare this record. A24.4.1.  If  the  shipping  document  is  classified,  it  must  be  in  the  custody  of  the  technical escort  or  other  qualified  personnel  accompanying  the  shipment.  In  the  absence  of accompanying  personnel,  and  if  the  document  is  not  classified,  the  shipper  will  place  the original and one copy in the outermost container of the number one package. A24.5.  Aircrew Jettison Criteria.  For cargo consisting of Class 6.1, PG I, hazard zone A toxic material; Class 2.3, hazard zone A toxic material; infectious substances; biological agents; or radioactive material (other than excepted quantities), the jettison criteria are as follows: A24.5.1.  Must not be jettisoned over land. A24.5.2.  May  not  be  jettisoned  over  water  unless  the  cargo,  in  addition  to  size  criteria, weighs at least 1.6 g/cm3 (100 lbs/ft3) to ensure sinking. Also, the cargo must be jettisoned at  least  19.3  kilometers  (12  miles)  offshore,  and  preferably  beyond  a  shelf,  in  water  100 fathoms  (600  feet)  or  more  in  depth.  The  aircraft  commander  is  given  a  predeparture briefing  on  acceptable  jettisoning  locations  based  on  the  above  criteria.  When  cargo  is jettisoned to decrease weight, jettison all other cargo before hazardous cargo. A24.5.3.  When cargo is leaking and is beyond control of the escort to repair or neutralize, the escort  must  inform  the  aircraft  commander.  The  decision  of  jettisoning  will  rest  with  the  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       477 aircraft  commander.  In  this  instance,  the  commander  may  jettison  the  cargo  over  water without regard to weight or depth criteria. A24.5.4.  When the cargo weighs less than 1.6 g/cm3 (100 lb./ft3) or when size of cargo would not  permit  inflight  jettisoning,  model  of  aircraft  selected  for  overwater  missions  must  be based  on  two-engine  performance  from  equal  time  point  (ETP)  to  destination.  Aircraft performance  is  based  on  aircraft  remaining  airborne  when  all  cargo  except  the  hazardous cargo is jettisoned.   478       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INITIAL AND REFRESHER TRAINING Attachment 25 A25.1.

Examples  for  Determining  Radioactive  Shipments.  A1/A2  values  represent  the maximum activity that can be shipped in a Type A package. A1 is for Special form material and  A2  values  is  for  Normal  or  Other  form  material.  In  dealing  with  mixtures  of radionuclides if the sum of the ratios is  <1, then use a Type A package. If the sum of the ratios is >1, then use a Type B package. A26.5.2.1.  Example  1.  Determine  the  most  appropriate  packaging  when  shipping  a mixture of 0.46 TBq of Bromine-77 (Br-77) & 0.25 TBq of Cerium-143 (Ce-143). Activity you have / Activity allowed = sum of the ratio 0.46 TBq/3 TBq = 0.15 (A2 for Br-77) 0.25 TBq/0.6 TBq = 0.42 (A2 for Ce-143) 0.15 + 0.42 = 0.57  Total sum of the ratios 0.57 < 1, so a Type A package is required A26.5.2.2.  Example  2.  Determine  if  the  item  can  be  shipped  as  a  RQ  of  a  hazardous substance. Shipping a mixture of 2.02 TBq of Silver-112 (Ag-112), 0.16 TBq of Tin-113 (Sn-113) & 0.21 TBq of Tungsten-185 (W-185). Activity you have / Reportable Quantity = RQ 2.02 TBq/3.7 TBq = 0.546 (RQ for Ag-112)  0.16 TBq/0.37 TBq = 0.432 (RQ for Sn-113) 0.21 TBq/0.37 TBq = 0.568 (RQ for W-185) Total RQ of 1.576 > 1  Therefore, mixture would be regulated as a hazardous substance. A26.5.2.3.  Example  3.  Determine  the  most  appropriate  packaging  when  shipping  the following: 1.45 TBq of Terbium-160 (Tb-160) A2 value for Tb-160 is 0. 6 TBq. 1.45  TBq  >  0.6  TBq  Since  the  amount  you  are  shipping  is  greater  than  the  A2  value;  a Type B package is required. A26.5.2.4.  Example  4.  Determine  the  most  appropriate  packaging  when  shipping  the following: 0.45 GBq of solid Niobium (Nb-95) internationally 0.45 GBq converted is 0.00045 TBq A2 value for Nb-95 = 1 TBq 10-3A2 = 0.001 TBq > 0.00045 TBq  A26.5.2.4.1.  Since  the  maximum  activity  allowed  is  greater  than  amount  being  shipped, the item can be shipped in an Excepted package.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       487  A26.6.  Properties  of  Common  Gases.  Figure  A26.6.  is  a  list  of  the  molecular  weight  and specific gravity of common gases. Figure A26.6.  Properties of Common Gases.  A26.7.  Lithium  Content.  Rechargeable  lithium  batteries  are  manufactured  without  lithium metals. There are two methods to determine equivalent lithium content. A26.7.1.  The rated capacity, in ampere-hours, of each cell times 0.3 expressed in grams (g). Example: A battery with 9 cells each having a rated capacity of 2.2 ampere-hours contains 5.94 grams of equivalent lithium content (2.2 X 0.3 X 9 = 5.94g) A26.7.2.  Dividing  the  stated  volts  (V)  on  a  battery  pack  by  3.7  (rounded  to  nearest  whole number),  multiplying  the  results  by  the  stated  ampere-hours  (Ah)  times  0.3.  Example: Battery  marked  with  14.8  (V)  and  4.8  (Ah)  contains  5.76  grams  of  equivalent  lithium content (14.8 divided by 3.7 = 4, 4 X 4.8 = 19.2, 19.2 X 0.3 = 5.76 grams) A26.8.    Lithium  batteries.  The  watt-hour  (Wh)  rating  is  a  measure  by  which  lithium  ion batteries  are  regulated.  Lithium  Ion  batteries  manufactured  after  31  December  2011  are required to be marked with their watt-hour rating. A26.8.1.  You can also arrive at the number of watt-hours your battery provides if you know the  battery’s  nominal  voltage  (V)  and  capacity  in  ampere-hours  (Ah):  Ah  x  V  =  Wh.  A battery of 14.8 V with a capacity of 2 Ah is 29.6 Wh normally rounded to 30 Wh  488       AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017  Attachment 27 PREPARING EXPLOSIVES PACKAGED PRIOR TO 1 JANUARY 1990  A27.1.

Comply with these procedures to maintain the performance capability of the package and the original shipper's certification. Noncompliance with any of these procedures constitutes repacking and requires a new certification. A28.2.2.1.  Fiberboard box opening. A28.2.2.1.1.  Cut original tape along seam using a shallow blade knife. Do not tear tape. A28.2.2.1.2.  If adhesive sealed on inside box flaps or the flaps are stitched/stapled (not closed by tape) opening will damage packaging components. A28.2.2.2.  Fiberboard box closure. A28.2.2.2.1.  Apply new tape over the existing tape using same method as original. A28.2.2.2.2.  Use only ASTM D 5486, Type I, Class 2 (film backed, pressure-sensitive adhesive, weather resistant) tape to reclose package. A28.2.2.2.3.  Ends of sealing tape must extend over the original tape a minimum of one-inch adhering to the fiberboard on the ends of the package. A28.2.2.2.4.  Use three-inch wide tape or two strips of two-inch wide tape. A28.2.2.2.5.  Ensure  surface  is  clean  and  dry  before  applying  tape  and  box  flaps  meet squarely. A28.2.2.2.6.  Do not cover markings or labels with tape. A28.2.2.2.7.  When reclosed using these procedures a new shipper's certification is  not required.  Based  on  DOD  testing  the  packaging  is  considered  returned  to  original condition and is not considered repacking.  AFMAN24-204  13 JULY 2017       519 A28.2.2.2.8.  If  adhesive  sealed  on  inside  box  flaps  or  flaps  are  stitched/stapled  (not closed  by  tape)  then  reclosure  is  considered  repacking  and  requires  a  new  shipper's certification. A28.2.2.3.  Wood box opening. A28.2.2.3.1.  Opening causes damage to packaging material. A28.2.2.3.2.  To reduce damage to wood material, use a nail puller to remove nails. A28.2.2.3.3.
