U2100 and JTR, par. C3054-B).  The legal rights to and liabilities of allow-ances are established when the travel expenses are incurred under orders.  Such orders may not be revisedor modified retroactively so as to increase or decrease the rights and benefits, which have been fixedunder the applicable statutes or instructions.  A clerical correction in the form of an amendment may bemade after the effective date of the orders only when an error is obvious on the face of the order and allfacts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that some provision previously determined and definitelyintended has been omitted through error in preparing the orders (54 Comp Gen. 638 (1975)). 2.2.  Competent Travel Orders Required for Payment. (JFTR, par. U2115, JTR, par. C3050, andDoDFMR Volume 9, Chapter 5).  The following are acceptable orders for payment: 2.2.1.  True or properly certified travel order copies. (Ensure both sides are copied). 2.2.2.  Extract order copies to include messages, which contain all pertinent information. 2.2.3.  Legible order copies reproduced by copying machines.  Do not withhold payment of a claimsolely because a travel order cites an incorrect accounting classification (centrally managed or spe-cific allotment).  Instead, state the correct accounting classification on the voucher and adjust the erro-neous obligation accordingly.  Refer to the DoDFMR Volume 9, 050307B for supportingdocumentation to change another accountable station’s accounting classification. 2.2.4.  Facsimile order copies can be sent for certification.  Once certified, the returned copy is treatedas the original. 2.2.5.  An electronic order signed with an electronic signature block. 2.3.  Classified Travel Orders. For specific requirements for travel under classified orders, see par.11-11. 2.4.  Order Effectiveness. (JFTR, par. U2140 and JTR, Chapter 3) Temporary Duty (TDY) ordersremain in effect if: 2.4.1.  A traveler traveling under blanket or repeated TDY orders returns from a mission to the perma-nent duty station (PDS). 2.4.2.  A traveler is required to return to the PDS for TDY requirements (field trips with courses ofinstruction) or transportation reasons (weather, fuel, mechanical delay, or procurement) and the ordercontemplates continued TDY. 2.4.3.  A traveler returns to the PDS including home (from which the traveler usually commutes to thePDS) for personal reasons during a TDY period. NOTE: No allowances are credited for any day the traveler was in a leave status for the whole day(JFTR, par. U4102-B and JTR, par. C4563-C1).  2.4.4.  Before completing TDY, additional TDY orders are published directing travel to another loca-tion, which may include the traveler’s PDS.  The additional TDY orders merely suspend executing theAFI65-114   26 AUGUST 200513original orders.  After completing the additional TDY, the traveler again comes under the provisionsof the initial order. 2.4.5.  FSO's may use a statement from the order-issuing official instead of an amended order to effectproper payment when the traveler: 2.4.5.1.  Adds or omits travel to places stated in the order 2.4.5.2.  Changes the order of continuity of places shown, or  2.4.5.3.  Changes the original specified time duration at a place stated in the order, provided thechange is within total time limits.  No amendment or statement is required for the changes in2.4.5.1. through 2.4.5.3. if itinerary variations are authorized. 14AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005Chapter 3   TRANSPORTATION AND ACCOMPANIED BAGGAGE ALLOWANCES AND LOCAL TRAVEL ALLOWANCES 3.1.

When a CTO is available and arrangements are made through anon-contract travel agent or common carrier direct purchase, reimbursement is limited to theamount the government would have paid if arrangement had been made through a CTO.  Thisdoes not imply that non-CTO use is acceptable, and travelers may be subject to disciplinaryaction for failing to comply with orders and DoD policy. NOTE: Finance Service Offices, Transportation Management Offices, order-issuing officials, command-ers, etc., should NOT promote non-CTO use for official travel.  This violates our Service contract with theCTOs.  Travelers must comply with the Fly America Act, see par. 3.4.  Tickets purchased directly froma non-contract travel agent or common carrier are not reimbursable when the trip is cancelled.  Use of unitfunds is not authorized to reimburse travelers under these circumstances.  Fees may be claimed forre-ticketing along with the self-procured airfare purchases.  The total cost of airfare and associated fees islimited to what the government would have paid if proper procedures had been followed.  3.2.3.1.2.  CTO Non-Availability.  The rare circumstances that the CTO is not available, theorder-issuing official must certify that a CTO was/is not available to arrange transportation.Reimbursement is paid for the actual cost of the authorized or approved transportation not toexceed (NTE) the least expensive unrestricted commercial coach fare that meets missionrequirements.  Note:  City-Pair airfares may not be available, since the CTO is not available. 3.3.  Directed Transportation Mode. (JFTR, par. U3002-B or JTR, par. C2206). 3.3.1.  Reimbursement Examples:  AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005153.3.1.1.  Member performs transoceanic travel on a PCS.  (JFTR, par. U5108).  Member person-ally procures air transportation for their transoceanic travel.  Member is not reimbursed for thistravel. 3.3.1.2.  Member with authorized dependents personally procures air transportation for the trans-oceanic travel on a PCS.  Member is not reimbursed for this travel; however, the dependents arelimited to what it would have cost the government to procure the transportation. 3.3.1.3.  Traveler is directed to utilize government-procured transportation for TDY travel.  Trav-eler procures his or her own ticket (non-CTO) or utilizes a POC to perform the travel.  Reimburse-ment to the traveler is limited to what it would have cost the government to procure the officialtransportation.   3.3.1.4.  Traveler is directed to utilize a government owned vehicle (GOV) as a passenger for TDYtravel.  Traveler utilizes a POC to perform the travel.  Traveler is not reimbursed since there is noadditional cost associated with the GOV (JFTR, par. U3002-B and JTR, pars. C2001-A3d andC4651-D2). 3.3.1.5.  Traveler is directed to utilize Military Air (MILAIR) for TDY travel.  If traveler procurestransportation, reimbursement is limited to the government cost for MILAIR travel (JFTR, par.U3002-B and JTR, par. C2206-B and E).  3.4.  U.S. Flag Air Carrier (Certificated Air Carrier) Use. (JFTR,  par.  U3125-C,  or  JTR,  par.C2204-B). 3.5.  Terminal Travel. (JFTR, par. U3320 and JTR, par. C4657).  If the traveler is a passenger in a POCowned/operated by a person not entitled to terminal travel reimbursement for that particular trip, the pas-senger is entitled to claim terminal mileage as owner/operator if he or she incurred operating expenses.When the traveler pays the parking fee at the terminal he or she may be reimbursed for such fee whetheror not mileage is claimed for travel to and from such terminal (JFTR, par. U3320-B or JTR, par. C4657-Bfor parking limitations).  For servicing OCONUS terminals see Attachment 2. 3.5.1.  Roundtrip Expenses Incurred for Drop-off or Pick-up at a Common Carrier Terminal.  (JFTR,par. U3320-A or JTR, par. C4657-A).  When a POC is driven round-trip to drop-off or pick-up a trav-eler at a common carrier terminal, the traveler shall be paid mileage for the round trip distance andreimbursed parking fees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls for the most direct route. 3.5.2.  Expenses Incurred for Two One-Way Trips to and from a Common Carrier Terminal.  (JFTR,par. U3320-B and JTR, par. C4657-B).  When a POC is used for one-way travel from a residence orduty station to a common carrier terminal and then from the terminal to a residence or duty stationwhen the TDY is completed, a traveler shall be paid mileage and reimbursed for parking fees, ferryfares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls for the most direct route. 3.5.3.  Traveler Departs from PDS on TDY.  (JFTR, par. U3320-C and JTR, par. C4657-C).  When aPOC is driven from a traveler’s residence to the PDS on the day the traveler departs from the PDS onTDY requiring at least one night's lodging, and from the PDS to the residence on the day the travelerreturns, the traveler who paid the expenses of operating the POC shall be paid mileage plus parkingfees, ferry fares, road, bridge and tunnel tolls for the most direct route. 3.5.4.  Two or More Travelers Travel in Same POC.  (JFTR, par. U3320-D and JTR, par. C4657-D).When a traveler transports other travelers to or from the same carrier terminal, mileage is authorized16AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005for the additional distance involved supported by a total distance or odometer readings certified ascorrect by the traveler.  Only one traveler may be paid mileage for the same trip.  A traveler who paysa parking fee at the terminal may be reimbursed.  3.6.  Reimbursement for the Cost of Damages to Commercial Rental Vehicles. (DoDFMR, Vol. 9,Chapter 4).  3.7.  Local Travel: (JFTR, pars. U3500 and U3505 and JTR, pars. C2400 and C2401). 3.7.1.  If the order-issuing official determines that a POC is authorized for local travel in and aroundthe PDS, the traveler shall be paid mileage for the distance that exceeds the traveler’s normal commut-ing distance.  Note: Designated-approving officials may not approve their own voucher(s) for pay-ment. 3.7.2.  Local Area Definition.  FSO’s must ensure that local directives clearly define the local area inwhich transportation expenses may be authorized or approved for conducting official business (JFTR,par. U3500-B and JTR, par. C2400-B).  When two or more installations are in proximity of each other,the senior commander or senior service commander should determine the local area.  Note:  An arbi-trary mileage radius should not be established in setting up the local commuting areas of permanentand temporary duty stations.  (59 Comp. Gen. 397 (1980)) 3.7.3.  Lodging in the Local Area.  (JFTR, pars. U4102-D, U4102-E, and U4105-H).  There is noauthority to pay per diem for travel or TDY within the PDS limits unless the TDY meets the criteriaof U4105-H.  Note:  Allowances under this paragraph are authorized when such duty is performedunder emergency circumstances that threaten injury to human life or damage to property of the Fed-eral Government, provided overnight accommodations are used by reason of such duty.  When travel-ers perform TDY in the local area but outside the PDS limits and require quarters, travel orders arenecessary to support payment of the claim.  See JTR, par. C4552-D for civilian employees. 3.8.  Excess Baggage. (JFTR, par. U3015 and JTR, par. C2302).  Travelers directed to perform a TDYcan be authorized/approved excess baggage.  This authority allows travelers to transport their excess bag-gage one of two ways: 3.8.1.  Hand carry the excess baggage with them on the designated flight; or 3.8.2.  Ship the excess baggage to their temporary duty station and/or permanent duty station.  Thepostal system must be utilized for shipment of excess baggage.  Travelers who decide to ship (mail)excess baggage are required to retain and provide a copy of the receipt from the post office (regardlessof amount).  The receipt must include the weight of the excess baggage being certified.  Mailingcharges are claimed on the settlement voucher and the receipt must accompany the claim. 3.9.  Service Charges for Cancelled Airline Reservations or Tickets. Airlines may assess surchargesfor cancelled airline reservations or tickets.  The following procedures are used to defray or reimbursethese surcharges as the situation may require: 3.9.1.  Traveler purchases ticket after orders are published; military or government procured transpor-tation becomes available and is used.  Reimburse surcharge under JFTR, par. U4520 or JTR, par.C4709 on the settlement voucher. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005173.9.2.  Traveler purchases ticket, uses it for a leg of the journey and another mode to complete travel.Reimburse the surcharge on the settlement voucher according to JFTR, par. U4520 or JTR, par. C4709provided the change in travel was driven by circumstances beyond the traveler's control. 3.9.3.  Traveler purchases ticket after orders are published, then trip is cancelled before effective date.Reimburse surcharge on SF 1164, Claim for Reimbursement for Expenditures on Official Business,and attach a copy of the original order along with rescinding amendment under JFTR, par. U4539 orJTR, par. C4710. 18AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005Chapter 4   TEMPORARY DUTY TRAVEL 4.1.  Travel of Aircrew Members (Military Members Only). (JFTR, par.  U2200-C, Table U2c and par.U7100).  Members of an organization, whose regularly assigned duty consists of performing flights froma PDS to other point(s) and return, are considered to be performing their regularly assigned duties.  Thesemembers are entitled to per diem allowances while away from the PDS.  However, there is no authorityfor reimbursement for travel expenses between home and place of abode and the place (office) where theyreport for their regular duties at the PDS.  To readily identify aircrew members, the abbreviation “ACRW”is to be entered on the Flight Authorization or DD Form 1610, Request and Authorization for TDY Travelfor DoD Personnel.  An aircrew member is away from the PDS when the aircraft departs (wheels up) untilthe aircraft returns (wheels down).  These provisions do not apply to Reserve Component aircrew mem-bers for travel upon call to and relief from active duty.  Aircrew status for Reserve Component membersonly applies after the member arrives at the active duty location and terminates when the member departsincident to relief from active duty. 4.2.  Per Diem Entitlement for TDY with or without a Fixed-Starting Date. (JFTR, par. U4100, JTR,par. C4552 and DoDFMR, Vol. 9). 4.2.1.  Policy on Per Diem Payment.  It is Air Force policy that travelers should not be paid per diemincident to reporting at a TDY station earlier than the date specified in orders or the date required toperform duty unless: 4.2.1.1.  Earlier reporting is necessary because of transportation schedule variations; 4.2.1.2.  The duty may be performed at any time as differentiated from a fixed period; or 4.2.1.3.  The order-issuing official determines that early reporting is or was in the government’sbest interest, or has been caused by conditions beyond the traveler’s control. 4.2.2.  Per Diem for Travel Time: 4.2.2.1.  TDY Having a Fixed Starting Date.  From the order, establish the required reporting date.Use this required reporting date for constructed travel time computation.  Use a schedule thatwould permit reporting at, or as close as possible before, the required reporting date.  Generalrules for determining required reporting date: 4.2.2.1.1.  If the order does not contain specific reporting instructions, establish requiredreporting time as though the order directed reporting on the day before the TDY (class, train-ing course, etc.) start date. 4.2.2.2.  TDY Not Having a Fixed Starting Date.  Normally, orders for this type of TDY containan on-or-about departure date from the PDS.  The absence of a specific reporting date usually indi-cates that accomplishment of the mission is not tied to a definite date or period.  Unless informa-tion concerning duty requirements indicates otherwise, accept the actual arrival date at the TDYstation as the required reporting date.  If the actual arrival date is not acceptable (for example, it isknown to be earlier than necessary), establish a required reporting date based on available infor-mation.  Use schedules, including Air Mobility Command (AMC) schedules when appropriate,that would permit reporting at, or as close as possible before, the required reporting date. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005194.2.3.  Continuous TDY Periods.  If a traveler performs two or more consecutive TDY periods(school, training courses, POE/POD travel, etc.) and through no fault of the traveler, there is an inter-val between the ending of one period and the starting of the next, per diem is payable for the period thetraveler remains at the first TDY location or after arrival at the next TDY location, to include officialtravel time between locations. 4.3.  Constructed Travel:  4.3.1.  Travel by POC Authorized as Advantageous to the Government.  (JFTR, par. U3305 and JTR,par. C4661-A). 4.3.1.1.  The constructed arrival date at the TDY location is the day before the first day of duty. 4.3.1.2.  The constructed time and departure date from the TDY location when returning to thePDS is 0600 hrs the day following the last day of duty.  (See Figure 4.1.) 4.3.1.3.  Constructed schedules should not include travel between 2400 and 0600. 4.3.2.  Travel by POC Not Advantageous (Traveler’s Convenience).  (JFTR, par. U3310 and JTR, par.C4661-B).  Cost of government transportation includes: 4.3.2.1.  Transportation Request (TR) cost(s) as shown in the TDY order or as quoted by the localCTO; 4.3.2.2.  Constructed transportation costs to and from the local servicing terminals (PDS andTDY); 4.3.2.3.  Constructed cost (obtained from TMO) to ship excess baggage authorized in the orderand verified with the traveler that the baggage was transported in the POC; and 4.3.2.4.  Constructed per diem for travel via the TR as determined by par. 4.3.4.  Compare the trav-eler’s actual travel and transportation allowances consistent with the cost of the government pro-cured transportation.  Pay the lesser of actual or constructed cost (Figure 4.2.).  For TDY travel,TR cost is based on city-pair fares, where applicable, otherwise, lowest unrestricted coach faresobtained by contacting TMO.  4.3.3.  Passengers in POCs: 4.3.3.1.  Advantageous to the Government.  Mileage allowance is not payable.  Per diem is paidfor travel as actually performed per JFTR, par. U3305 and JTR, par. C4661. 4.3.3.2.  Not Advantageous to the Government.  Mileage allowance is not payable.  Per diem ispaid for actual travel time or constructed schedule computed in par. 4.3.4., whichever results in thelesser amount. 4.3.4.  All Other Modes.  (JFTR, pars. U4325 and U4340 and JTR, pars. C2207 and C4661-C).  Indetermining a constructed schedule, (see Figure 4.2. and Figure 4.3.), use the following steps: 4.3.4.1.  To a TDY Location: 4.3.4.1.1.  Establish the authorized reporting date according to par. 4.2. of this instruction. 4.3.4.1.2.  Determine required transportation mode(s), i.e., either/or a combination of air, rail,or bus. 20AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20054.3.4.1.3.  Use a schedule that allows arrival before or on the authorized reporting date (estab-lished in par. 4.3.4.1.1. above) from: 4.3.4.1.3.1.  Air--Transportation Management Office (TMO)/CTO. 4.3.4.1.3.2.  Rail--TMO/CTO. 4.3.4.1.3.3.  Bus--Local bus schedule. 4.3.4.1.4.  Always allow adequate travel time for the traveler to arrive at the carrier terminaltwo hours before scheduled departure on domestic flights, three hours for international flights,and to travel from the carrier terminal to place of duty.  Note:  Additional time authorizedwhen local conditions warrant. 4.3.4.1.5.  Do not begin or end a constructed schedule, including terminal travel, between2400-0600 hours unless that is the only schedule available to meet the required reporting date/time. 4.3.4.2.  From a TDY location to the PDS: 4.3.4.2.1.  Establish departure day after the last duty day. 4.3.4.2.2.  Determine required transportation mode(s), i.e., either/or a combination of air, rail,or bus. 4.3.4.2.3.  Use a schedule that allows departure on the authorized departure date (establishedin par. 4.3.4.2.1. above) from: 4.3.4.2.3.1.  Air--TMO/CTO. 4.3.4.2.3.2.  Rail--TMO/CTO. 4.3.4.2.3.3.  Bus--Local bus schedule. 4.3.4.2.4.  Always allow adequate travel time for the traveler to arrive at the carrier terminaltwo hours before scheduled departure on domestic flights, three hours on international flights,and allow sufficient travel time from carrier terminal to place of duty or home.  Note:  Addi-tional time authorized when local conditions warrant. 4.3.4.2.5.  Do not begin or end a constructed schedule, including terminal travel, between2400-0600 hours unless that is the only schedule available.  Note:  When the actual travel timeby POC, not to exceed the allowable travel time (JFTR, par. U3005-C and JTR, par. C4300),results in a lesser per diem entitlement than the constructed time, use the actual.  For travelbetween TDY locations, use steps for travel to a TDY location (See par. 4.3.4.1.). 4.3.5.  Constructed Lodging Costs.  In many instances, it is necessary to construct a traveler as if he orshe remained overnight at a TDY point.  For example, a traveler performs required duty on any givenday and departs the same day after completion of duty for leave.  The traveler’s constructed schedule(if required) should start no earlier than the day after the last day of duty.  The lodging cost incurredfor the previous day (if any) is included in the constructed cost.  Example:  Traveler departs TDYpoint on 1 June; duty performed that day.  On 31 May, the member incurred a $14.00 VOQ charge.Allow the ‘constructed’ $14.00 VOQ charge for 1 June consistent with the constructed schedule. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005214.3.6.  Delays.  Treat necessary delays at POE or POD as authorized delays.  The member remains ina travel status when government scheduled transportation causes early arrival at the port or causes adelay at the port awaiting onward transportation. 4.4.  TDY Travel and Leave (Military Members Only):  4.4.1.  General.  A member on TDY may be authorized leave en route. 4.4.2.  Leave En route to and from TDY (including Permissive Travel).  (See Table 4.1.).  Chargeleave for all excess travel time (any days not included in the constructed schedule or days not catego-rized as permissive travel time.  (See Table 4.2.). 4.4.2.1.  Constructed schedule includes travel by POC if the cost is less than TR.  Exceptions tocharging leave may be made when duty is performed for the majority of a day on the departure dayor arrival day at the PDS or when the departure day from the PDS is a non-duty day. 4.4.2.2.  Permissive travel in conjunction with funded TDYs, where the permissive travel is takeneither prior to or after completing the funded TDY, does not negate the travel entitlement to thefunded TDY location.  Travel allowances are properly payable for direct travel from the PDS tofunded TDY locations(s) and return to the PDS.  (See AFI 36-3003) 4.4.3.  Leave During TDY: 4.4.3.1.  The TDY unit controls and reports through its servicing FSO, leave taken during a TDYperiod that involves departure from and return to the TDY station.  The member should attach acopy of each AF Form 988, Leave Request/Authorization, issued during TDY to the travelvoucher.  4.4.3.2.  Leave taken at a TDY point and reported by the TDY FSO appears on the by-others trans-action portion of the JDC listing UH099CA11.  (See DFAS-DEM 7073-1).  Obtain a copy of thelisting from the customer support section and check for possible leave (SB) transactions. 4.4.3.2.1.  If the voucher has been paid, verify that no per diem was paid during the leaveperiod and contact the member if the data is questionable.  If per diem was erroneously paidwhile in leave status, take collection action. 4.4.3.2.2.  If the voucher has not been paid, suspense the listing until the member's estimatedTDY return date to compare it with the voucher before settlement to ensure no per diem is paidwhile in leave status.  Continue to suspense this listing until a voucher is filed. 4.4.3.3.  Leave taken at the PDS before or after the TDY is not to be included in the orders.  Iforders erroneously authorize leave at the PDS, Customer Support must advise the CommanderSupport Staff to take appropriate action. 4.4.3.4.  Passes During TDY.  Passes cannot be used for additional travel time.  Passes must startand end at the same location according to AFI 36-3003. 4.4.3.5.  Return to PDS from TDY for Personal Reasons.  (JFTR, par. U4130).  Members who vol-untarily return to the PDS between TDY locations are charged leave, except non-duty days, forany days not involved in the constructed travel schedule between TDY points.  Note:  Memberswho return to the PDS/home on a special pass (See AFI 36-3003) are returning to PDS for per-sonal reasons. 22AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20054.4.3.6.  Travel from TDY Station during Downtime.  (JFTR, par. U4130).  Members on TDYoften find themselves in the situation where training or duty is interrupted.  An example of this sta-tus is during the Christmas/New Years holiday season.  For employee’s guidance see par. 10.2. ofthis instruction. 4.4.3.6.1.  When a member returns to the PDS to perform duty, allowances prescribed in JFTR,par. U4130 are authorized.  If the member is not directed to return home; therefore, the condi-tions under return to PDS for personal reason applies.  Note:  The PDS commander mustapprove return to the PDS to perform duty.  A statement from the PDS commander must beattached to the travel claim. 4.4.3.6.2.  Members remaining at the TDY location continue with TDY allowances. 4.4.3.6.3.  Members returning to the PDS in a leave status or who take leave at a location otherthan the PDS (to include convalescent leave) are not entitled to per diem or transportation,JFTR, par U4102-B.  This paragraph does not apply to return to the PDS for personal reasonswhen not in a leave status.  Normal rules for charging leave apply.  The TDY unit charges theleave. 4.5.  Permissive Travel Time. Air Force policy allows permissive travel time to be granted to membersauthorized to travel by POC for personal convenience on a funded TDY of 16 calendar days or more, asstated on the order, at one location and the member is not reimbursed actual travel costs according toJFTR, par. U3310, and Chapter 4, par. 4.4. of this instruction.  To compute the number of permissivetravel days granted, subtract the number of constructed travel days from the lesser of the actual travel daysused or the number of authorized travel days (350 miles per day, JFTR, par. U3305-C).  (See Figure 4.4.).(Example:  1000 miles/350 = 3 days authorized by POC:  actual travel days used is greater than autho-rized; member is authorized 3 days (1 constructed, 2 permissive); any excess travel days are charged asleave).  Permissive travel time is not authorized when a directed transportation mode is available but notused.  Additional per diem or actual expense is not authorized for days categorized as permissive traveltime.  WHEN THE ORDER-ISSUING OFFICIAL AUTHORIZES TRAVEL BY POC FOR PERSONALCONVENIENCE IN TDY ORDERS, AN ADDITIONAL STATEMENT SPECIFICALLY AUTHORIZ-ING PERMISSIVE TRAVEL TIME IS NOT REQUIRED.  A member, who originally met the 16-calen-dar day criterion, cannot be denied permissive travel time when the TDY is curtailed before the16-calendar day period is met.  When a member's original TDY is less than 16 calendar days and aftertravel commences, the TDY is extended to 16 or more calendar days, permissive travel time is not autho-rized.  4.6.  Inpatient Authorized to Subsist Out. (JFTR, par. U7125-D) (See Figure 4.5.). 4.7.  Field Duty. (JFTR, par. U4102-L). 4.7.1.  A member on field duty (See Glossary of Terms) is not entitled to per diem except under con-ditions described in JFTR, par. U4102-L. 4.7.2.  Issuance of Non-Field Duty Certificate.  Members on field duty who have one of the exceptionsprovided in JFTR, par. U4102-L, are required to obtain non-field duty certificates from the appropri-ate official to support payment of per diem.  AF Form 2282, Statement of Adverse Effect-Use of Gov-ernment Facilities, DD 1351-5, Government Quarters and Meals, or a memo approved by the TDYsite Commander (or designee) may be used to support reimbursement of occasional meals actuallyAFI65-114   26 AUGUST 200523purchased.  See JFTR, pars. U4102-L and U4510.  Note:  Reimbursement is based on actual expense(See JTFR, par. U4510-B2).  If no funds are expended, there is no reimbursement.  Reimbursementmust not exceed the PMR.  The incidental expense portion is not payable see JFTR, par. U4510-B2.For civilian employees see JTR, par. C4554-D. 4.8.  TDY Travel Involving International Dateline. (JFTR, par. U4115 and JTR, par. C4553-E).  Incomputing per diem where the international dateline is involved, the computation is based on actualelapsed time rather than calendar days.  (See 39 Comp. Gen. 853 (1960)).  (See Figure 4.6.). 4.9.  Actual Expense Allowance (AEA). (JFTR, Chapter 4, Part C and JTR, Chapter 4, Part M).  Appli-cable approval authority is in JFTR and JTR, Appendix L.  Information to be included in request islocated in JFTR, par. U4215-F and JTR, par. C4603-F. 4.9.1.  AEA claims over 150% not to exceed 300%.  Follow the format in JFTR, par. U4215-F andJTR, par. C4603-F.  Before a claim can be forwarded for consideration, the traveler must first obtainapproval from the lower level AEA approval official (wing commander or equivalent or delegated togroup commander).  Tenant Units or Detachments have the discretion to staff their AEA requests tothe host Wing Commander or their own Wing Commander/MAJCOM.  The claim can be denied atthat level of authority.  In such cases, the claim will not be forwarded to a higher level for further con-sideration. 4.9.1.1.  Air Force policy requires the following additional information on AEA claims: allowedcosts, actual costs, difference in costs, summary of efforts made to secure lodging within estab-lished per diem rates--to include list of lodging facilities contacted and complete explanation ofthe circumstances that warranted the request.  Note:  Claims are limited to significant circum-stances beyond the traveler’s control; e.g., natural disasters or major events or conferences thathave affected all the lodging facilities in an area.  Travelers are responsible for ensuring travelarrangements are made within the prescribed per diem rates.  Lack of knowledge of prescribedrates is not justification for an AEA claim over 150% of the prescribed per diem rates. 4.9.1.2.  For cases forwarded to higher headquarters for approval/disapproval, the authority listedin JFTR/JTR, Appendix L is the final authority. 4.9.1.3.  The AEA authority may not be used as a blanket authority.  It must be used only on anindividual trip basis, and only after appropriate consideration is given to the facts existing in eachcase at the time travel is directed and performed.  This does not prevent AEAs for groups or con-ferences under JFTR, par. U4215-B and JTR, par. C4603-B. 4.9.1.4.  Conference Lodging.  See JFTR, Chapter 2, Part G and JTR, Chapter 4, Part S. 4.10.  Availability and Use of Government Quarters.  4.10.1.  Members who perform TDY of 24 hours or less at a military installation are encouraged to useavailable government quarters to the maximum extent possible.  Per diem cannot be reduced if amember does not use government facilities when the duration of TDY or delay is less than 24 hours,even though the travel order directs use of such facilities (JFTR, par. U1045-B4).  A member whoseoriginal delay was 24 hours or less, and is extended at the location (to include circumstances beyondtheir control), reverts to the rule for members TDY for more than 24 hours and must use availablegovernment facilities, unless the government quarters use would have adversely affected mission per-24AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005formance.  If a member voluntarily uses quarters at a nearby military installation, use of availablemessing facilities does not reduce per diem entitlement (JFTR, pars. U4125, U4400 and U1045).  Fornon-availability documentation, see JFTR, par. U1045-C. 4.10.2.  For civilian employees see JTR, par. C1055.  4.11.  Changes to Selected Meal Options. The order-issuing official is responsible for selecting theappropriate meal option prior to preparation of the TDY orders.  However, there may be circumstanceswhere the meal option selected turns out to be inappropriate and, in these cases, the order-issuing officialmay change the meal option.  It is important to remember a meal option resulting in a reduced entitlementcannot be made retroactive with the exception of a deductible meal.  (See JFTR, par. U4165 for rule). 4.11.1.  Meal option changes that result in an increased per diem rate.  The order-issuing officialselects the meal option based on the mission and information available http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem/lodging.html (AFMAN 34-255) when the TDY order is being prepared.  If, at any point, it is deter-mined that the meal option selected was insufficient (increased only), it may be changed to reflect theproper meal option.  This is based on the non-availability of meals (missed meals).  Example:  Thetraveler’s order states government dining facility is directed; however, due to the work schedule thetraveler misses a meal.  Upon return, the order-issuing official would annotate the order with theappropriate meal option, in this case the proportional meal rate.  If the member is deployed in supportof a Joint Task Force (JTF), missed meals are tracked using the AF Form 2282, Statement of AdverseEffect.  The deployed commander or designee approves non-availability of directed meals.  The mem-ber submits this information when filing the travel voucher.  Note:  Only the tasking headquarters canchange meal options for members deployed in support of a JTF operation.  Local order-issuing offi-cials cannot dictate a meal option different than the tasking message.  This does not preclude use ofthe AF Form 2282 when appropriate signatures are obtained. 4.11.2.  Meal option change that results in a decreased per diem rate.  The order-issuing official selectsthe meal option based on the mission and information available when the TDY order is being pre-pared.  If, during the TDY, a different meal option becomes applicable, the order-issuing official maydirect a new meal option using a current or future effective date.  The TDY order is annotated with thenew direction and effective date.  Example:  The order-issuing official authorizes the locality rate,due to the non-availability of a dining facility at the TDY location.  The order-issuing official is noti-fied that the dining facility is now available.  Using this information and a review of the missionrequirements, the order-issuing official could decide to direct the member to use the government din-ing facility.  If the order-issuing official determines the government dining facility would meet themission requirements, the TDY traveler would be briefed that government meals are available anddirected and the Government Meal Rate (GMR) will become effective on a current date or future date.Upon return, the order-issuing official would annotate the order with the appropriate directed mealoption and date directed.  It is important to remember that the meal option cannot be changed to reflecta RETROACTIVE DECREASE in entitlement.  Example:  Member’s TDY order is silent on mealdirection.  Upon return from TDY, the order-issuing official states the order was prepared incorrectlyand the member should have been directed to use the government dining facility.  The member wouldstill be entitled to the locality meal rate since travel has been completed and the change requiredwould result in a retroactive reduction. 4.11.3.  TDY members who are directed to use government dining facility and quarters:  If the TDYmember is unable to occupy government quarters at the TDY installation due to non-availability, theyAFI65-114   26 AUGUST 200525are entitled to the full locality per diem rate for the TDY area.  The order-issuing official cannot directmembers quartered off-installation to use the government dining facility at the TDY installation, as itis not available. 4.12.  Members on TDY with a Joint Task Force. (JFTR, par. U4800).  Travel and transportationallowances, to include per diem options, are determined by the Combatant Commander or JTF Com-mander and published in the tasking messages.  The Combatant Commander or JTF Commander canchange travel and transportation allowances.  Local deployment commanders do not have the authority tochange tasking guidance without approval of the Combatant Commander or JTF Commander.  Prior totravel payment, all tasking messages must be reviewed. 4.13.  Communication Services. (JFTR, par. U4505 or JTR, par. C4706). 4.14.  Reimbursement for Charges Connected to ATM Withdrawals. (DoDFMR Volume 9, Chapter3, JFTR, par. U4520-A2 and JTR, par. C4709-A2). 4.15.  Registration Fees. (JFTR, par. U4535 and JTR, par. C4955-E).  Registration fee reimbursement isauthorized/approved when such fees are a condition for attendance.  See AFI 65-601, Volume 1, Chapter4, for rules on registration fees.  The authorization or approval for payment of registration fees is a func-tion of the order-issuing official. 4.15.1.  While TDY or outside Limits of PDS: 4.15.1.1.  Meals.  Payment of a registration fee, which includes the cost of one or two meals,requires payment of proportional per diem in accordance with the JFTR, par. U4165 and JTR, par.C4554-B2.  There is no deduction made to the M&IE allowance for light refreshments furnishedat nominal or no cost (JFTR, par. U2550-O and JTR, par. C4955-E4). 4.15.1.2.  Quarters.  If registration fees include the lodging cost, the lodging portion of per diem iszero for the applicable day(s). 4.15.2.  At the PDS.  As no per diem is payable during attendance at these meetings, no adjustment isrequired from authorized registration fees. 4.16.  Service Charges for Cancelled Airline Reservations or Tickets. (JFTR, par. U4539 and JTR,par. C4710).  See Chapter 3 of this instruction on service charge reimbursement. 4.17.  Other Miscellaneous Expenses. (JFTR, Chapter 4, Part F and JTR, Chapter 4, Part O). 26AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005Table 4.1.  TDY Travel Time and Leave Determination (Round Trip TDY).

When a member travels by mixedmodes as defined in JFTR, Volume 1, Appendix A, for an authorized leg of the journey, total reim-bursement for POC and personally-procured commercial travel may be no more than the MALTPLUS payable for the entire ordered travel distance less the cost of any government procured trans-portation used for a portion of the journey.  (Note:  Do not collect excess cost from the member ifdeducting the cost of the Government-procured transportation for the ordered travel from the MALTPLUS results in a negative amount.) 5.2.  En Route Temporary Duty (TDY).  5.2.1.  General.  (JFTR, par. U5113).  When PCS orders direct TDY after departure from the old per-manent duty station (PDS), but before arriving at the new PDS, a member is authorized per diem IAWJFTR, Chapter 4.  Compute travels time as if each leg of the travel were a separate PCS. 5.2.2.  Authorized Reporting Time.  Follow the instructions in Chapter 4 of this instruction to deter-mine authorized reporting time and date.  The authorized reporting date is a day of duty and lodgingsplus per diem is payable.  When the departure day is a day of duty lodgings plus per diem is payableunless needed to pay MALT PLUS per diem. 5.2.3.  TDY at or Near Old or New PDS.  (JFTR, par. U5120-D).  The Air Force does not authorizeplacement of members on TDY under these conditions.  This TDY must be performed before depar-ture from the old PDS or after arrival at the new PDS (AFI 36-2110, par. 4.6.4.1).  If a member per-forms TDY to a new PDS (PCS order published) prior to departing in a PCS status, TDY allowancesare properly payable if the member returns to the old PDS prior to departure and performs regularlyassigned duties.  If the member's return is solely for out-processing, with no other duty performed,TDY allowances are not payable (AFI 36-2110, par. 4.6.4.2.1. and Comp Gen. B-216465, 22 May1985). 5.2.4.  Members who arrive at their new PDS and require additional training at the same PDS prior toassuming their new duties cannot receive per diem.  (JFTR, par. U4102-D). 5.3.  Enlistment, Reenlistment, or Induction. (JFTR, par. U5108-C).  It is Air Force policy that mem-bers whose first assignment is for basic training, indoctrination, or processing are furnished transportationin kind and meal tickets (MTs).  If available transportation or MTs are not used, no reimbursement isauthorized.  If transportation and MTs are not available, the member is authorized to travel and transpor-tation allowances, IAW, Chapter 5. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005415.4.  Travel Via Designated Place. The allowances prescribed in JFTR, par. U5120-G are authorized to amember who travels via the designated place of dependents when they relocate at Government expenseto/from that place incident to the member's PCS to/from an unaccompanied or dependent restricted over-seas tour.  For computing allowances, use separate legs of travel to/from the designated place (per diem isnot payable while at the designated place). 5.5.  Circuitous Travel. (JFTR, par. 5116-E and AFI 24-101, par. 3.10). 5.6.  Separation/Retirement from the Service or Relief from Active Duty. (JFTR, par. U5125 and par.U5130).  Once a home is selected and allowances have been received, (monetary or in-kind) a membercannot change that selection (the selection is irrevocable). 5.6.1.  The MPF determines if airmen and Reserve officers separating at date of separation (DOS)qualify for full travel entitlement and includes this authority in the separation order.  HQ AFPC makesthe determination for Reserve/Regular officer actions they approve (see AFIs 36-2102 and 36-2110). 5.6.2.  A member separating from the service has 6 months from their date of separation to completetravel.  A member retiring from the service has 12 months to complete travel.  Travel and transporta-tion time limitation extensions (JFTR, par. U5012-I).  See Air Force Supplement, JFTR, Volume 1 forAir Force policy for extensions. 5.7.  Allowable Travel Time Computation. (JFTR, par. U5160). 5.7.1.  General.  Travel time is computed independently of monetary entitlement. 5.7.2.  Orders Canceled, Amended, or Modified.  (JFTR, par. U5120-E).  Compute allowable traveltime for PCS travel between the points for which member was authorized travel allowances.  Computeeach leg of travel as a separate PCS.  The date notified is a duty day. 5.7.3.  Allowable Travel Time-Insufficient to Accomplish Required Travel.  (JFTR, par. U5160-E).Additional travel time may be authorized/approved when actual travel time exceeds authorized traveltime for reasons beyond the member’s control (such as acts of God, restrictions by Governmentauthorities, difficulties in obtaining fuel for POCs or other reasons satisfactory to the member’s newcommanding officer).  The amount of additional travel time authorized may be the actual delay periodor a shorter period as determined appropriate by the member’s new commanding officer.  The expla-nation of the circumstances, which necessitated the delay, together with the commanding officer’saction, must be attached to the voucher. 5.7.3.1.  Inconvenience or personal wishes are not a basis for submission of a request. 5.7.4.  PCS from Leave Status.  If the member is reassigned while in an emergency or ordinary leavestatus, the leave is cancelled by the losing unit and the entire period, including leave, allowable traveltime, and proceed time, is computed by the gaining station. 5.7.5.  Travel Time for Separation/Retirement.  Separate travel time is not granted.  Member maydepart PDS on/after start date of permissive TDY/terminal leave. 5.8.  Leave.  5.8.1.  Dates on Travel Vouchers.  Use departure and arrival dates as shown on member's travel itiner-ary to compute allowable travel time, chargeable leave, and proceed time.  Member's departure and42AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005arrival dates should coincide with departure and arrival dates to or from PDS or local area, whicheverapplies or date member is available for duty. Examples: Member arrives Peterson AFB, CO on Friday and checks into billeting and calls his/her supervisor.Member reports to duty section Monday morning.  Arrival date is Friday. Member arrives F.E. Warren AFB, WY on Monday and checks into billeting.  Member reports to dutyon Friday.  Arrival date is Friday. 5.8.2.  Time in Excess of Allowable Travel Time.  Charge the time used by a member in excess of theallowable travel time, unless otherwise provided for, against member's leave account. 5.8.3.  Departure Day. 5.8.3.1.  The departure day from the permanent duty station, regardless of hour, is a day of leave,unless out-processing was required to be performed that day. 5.8.3.2.  For TDY en route, the departure day from the TDY station is a day of leave, unless themember performed scheduled duties/out-processing (more than checking out of lodging) beforedeparture. 5.8.4.  Arrival Day.  The arrival day for duty at a station, regardless of the hour, is a duty day. 5.8.5.  A member who is not eligible for dependent travel at government expense but who has beenauthorized space-available transportation for the dependents to CONUS must be charged leave whileawaiting such transportation. 5.8.6.  Graduation Leave for Academy Graduates.   (AFI 36-3003, par. 14.11.1).  Graduates must takeand complete graduation leave within three months after the members’ graduation and before theyreport to their first PDSs or ports of embarkation for permanent duty outside the CONUS. 5.8.7.  Leave on Separation and Retirement.  When member files final settlement voucher for separa-tion and retirement travel, take the following action: 5.8.7.1.  If the voucher shows that the member departed the final PDS on or after date of separa-tion (DOS) or retirement (DOR), no leave is chargeable. 5.8.7.2.  If the settlement voucher itinerary shows that the member departed the PDS before DOS/DOR: 5.8.7.2.1.  Determine if permissive TDY/terminal leave was charged.  If the member departedprior to permissive TDY/terminal leave start date, travel-generated leave is chargeable for theexcess days.  If the member out-processed the duty day prior to start of permissive/terminalleave, allow this day as a day of duty.  5.9.  Ports of Embarkation (POE) and Debarkation (POD). (JFTR, par. U5160-B). 5.9.1.  The authorized reporting time and date at a POE is one day prior to port call.  If member arrivesearly and doesn't obtain a statement authorizing early arrival from personnel or the appropriate sup-port agency, the actual departure day from the POE is the port call date and one day prior to port callis the authorized reporting time.  Excess time is charged as leave.  Use actual or constructed traveltime between permanent duty station (PDS) and POE/POD.  For computation of PCS travel and leave,treat POE/POD as TDY en route. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005435.9.2.  Do not charge leave for the arrival day at POD even though member departs from the port thesame day on leave. 5.10.  Delay Involving POV Port and POE/POD.  5.10.1.  When non-duty day(s) (weekends and holidays) immediately precedes the port call date andimmediately follow the day the POV was delivered for shipment, additional travel time is authorizedfor the interim non-duty day(s). 5.10.2.  When non-duty day(s) immediately follows the arrival day at the POD and immediately pre-cede the day the POV was picked up from the POV port, additional travel time is authorized for theinterim non-duty day(s). 5.10.3.  MALT PLUS is authorized for the member and dependents (if applicable) for the non-dutyday(s) authorized as additional travel time.  A commander's approval is not required when travel isaccomplished according to par. 5.10.1. or par. 5.10.2. of this instruction. 5.11.  Recruiters’ Assistance Program (RAP). (AFI 36-3003, par. 14.10).  Members may be authorizedto participate in this program upon graduation from technical school or officer’s training school (OTS),and prior to arrival at first PDS for a period not to exceed 12 days.  The days are charged as permissivetravel. 5.12.  Permissive PCS Travel. The arrival day at the new PDS is a day of duty.  All other time is chargedas leave. 5.13.  Proceed Time. (AFI 36-2102).  Members authorized to transportation of dependents and/or ship-ment of household goods or unaccompanied baggage may be authorized four days of proceed time whenbeing reassigned to or from an unaccompanied or dependent restricted tour.  Proceed time is authorizedonly when members actually relocate their dependents and/or household goods (to include unaccompa-nied baggage) in conjunction with the unaccompanied tour or dependent restricted tour.  It is a four-dayperiod of authorized absence not chargeable to leave or travel time.  The time is meant to enable a memberto attend to the administrative details involved in a PCS move.  If proceed time is authorized, charge thelast four days that would have been charged as leave as proceed time.  If this is impractical, due to report-ing requirements, proceed time may be any four non-travel days between departure day from the old PDSto arrival day at the new PDS.  Proceed time is not granted under the following conditions: 5.13.1.  Incident to the member's first PCS or, 5.13.2.  Incident to separation, release from active duty or retirement. 5.14.  Per Diem Entitlement at Separation Processing Station of Choice (SPBC).   (JFTR,  pars.U5125-A3 and U5130-A3). 5.14.1.  Applicable to members retiring/separating from OCONUS locations.  (AFI 36-3203, par. 2.2). 5.14.2.  SPBC is an Air Force base in the United States with an MPF and FSO selected by the retiring/separating member as the base nearest or most directly en route to the member’s projected HOS/HOR (AFI 36-3203, par. 2.4).  The selected destination for HHG shipment should determine theappropriate SPBC.  SPBCs selected for high housing allowances or personal travel preferences are notauthorized. 44AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005Example:  Member is stationed at Ramstein AB, Germany and is retiring.  Member selects Los Ange-les AFB, CA as the SPBC.  However, the member’s HHG government bill of lading states Biloxi, MS.The SPBC should be Keesler AFB, MS.   5.14.3.  The SPBC is treated as a TDY location en route to the HOS/HOR.  A member is authorizedper diem while at the SPBC.  Exception:  member separates/retires at the SPBC.  If the member’sHOS/HOR is located within the local area of the SPBC, then per diem is not authorized. 5.15.  Use of More Than Two Privately Owned Conveyance (POC) for PCS, Separation/ RetirementTravel. (JFTR, par. U5015-B).  Use of more than two POCs may be authorized/approved as advantageousin the order or by a statement from the order-issuing/approving official for PCS, separation or retirementtravel.  Only AFPC can authorize/approve items in par. 5.15.7. below.  If authorization is not stated in theorder, the traveler is required to file the original and one copy of the statement with the travel claim.Qualifying factors: 5.15.1.  More than eight family members travel together by POC, including the member; 5.15.2.  Because of age or physical condition, a dependent needs special accommodations in one vehi-cle and second and third vehicles are required for more than five other family members; 5.15.3.  A member must report to a new duty station in advance of travel by dependents who delaytravel for acceptable reasons (such as school term completion, property sale, settlement of personalbusiness affairs, HHG transportation, non-availability of adequate housing at the new duty station)and more than four dependents travel by POC later; 5.15.4.  More than four dependents travel unaccompanied by POC between authorized points otherthan those for the member’s travel (such as travel to/from a designated place without the member or tothe new PDS when the member has TDY en route;  5.15.5.  More than four dependents travel unaccompanied to the new duty station in advance of themember’s reporting date for acceptable reasons (such as to enroll children in school at the beginningof the term or secure housing);  5.15.6.  More than six family members travel together by POC, including the member, over theALCAN highway (safety guidelines require extra spare tires, parts, tools, etc.); or  5.15.7.  Special circumstances not included in 5.15.1. through 5.15.6. must be authorized/approved byAFPC. NOTE: The purpose of reimbursing members MALT PLUS per diem is to “move” people not vehicles. 5.16.  PCS Travel Involving Ocean-going Ferries. (JFTR, par. U5116-C3).  For examples of travelinvolving ocean-going ferries, see Figure 5.1. and Figure 5.2.. Section 5B—Dependent Travel  (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part C and Appendix A). 5.17.  General. Reimbursement for dependent travel is authorized only if travel has been performed withthe intent to establish a bona fide residence.  (JFTR, par. U5203-B)  The reasons listed below are nottravel to a bona fide residence: 5.17.1.  Presumption that a home would be selected, AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005455.17.2.  Brief stays to conduct official business,  5.17.3.  Establishment of legal residence, that is, registers to vote, obtains driver’s license, etc., in aparticular state unless travel is performed thereto, or 5.17.4.  Trips involving short visits, to friends, or relatives, and vacations. 5.18.  Dependency Determination. (JFTR, Appendix A): 5.18.1.  General.  Eligible dependents for travel allowance purposes are defined in JFTR, Appendix A.When a determination on a questionable relationship or dependency has been made, documentation isfiled in the FSO management file for future reference (see DFAS-DEM 7073-1).  This data is requiredby administrative personnel to support the issuance of travel orders, and by FSOs in the settlement oftravel claims. 5.18.2.  DFAS-DE Determinations.  Dependency determinations are processed by DFAS-PMJPD/DEon referrals and rebuttals submitted by the FSO.  DFAS-PMJPD/DE will advise FSOs of approval ordisapproval. 5.19.  Monetary Allowance in Lieu of Transportation (MALT) PLUS Per Diem. (JFTR, pars. U5015and U5210).  The following procedures apply for dependents traveling by POC for the official distance ofordered travel. 5.19.1.  Concurrent vs. Non-concurrent.  Dependents are not traveling concurrently with the memberif they travel separately from the member on different routes or at different times.  (See Figure 5.3.). Example:  Dependents depart three hours after the member departs in a separate POC.  They meet atthe same location later that day and complete the PCS travel concurrently.  This does not constitutenon-concurrent travel. 5.20.  Travel and Transportation Involving Old and/or New Non-PDS Location. (JFTR, par.U5218).  Once a member has exercised the right to transportation of dependents to an alternate location,further transportation at government expense is not authorized incident to that PCS even though the alter-nate location to which dependents travel is a shorter distance than travel between the old and the new sta-tion. 5.21.  Student Dependents. The first travel to the member’s new PDS must be accomplished on themember’s PCS order. Example:  Member is stationed at Hickam AFB, HI and receives orders to Kadena AFB, Japan.  Studentdependent departs Hickam prior to member’s departure on a student dependent travel order in August andstarts the fall college term.  At Christmas, the dependent travels to Kadena.  This travel must be accom-plished on the member’s PCS order.  Travel entitlement is limited to the ordered travel (Hickam toKadena).  The student dependent may be returned to school on student dependent travel orders. Section 5C—Household Goods.  (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part D). 5.22.  General. (JFTR, par. U5300).  Air Force household goods (HHG) shipment policy is in AF Supple-ment/JFTR, Volume 1.  Included in this instruction are procedures and approval authorities for extensionof separation and retirement limitations. 46AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20055.23.  Personally Procured Move (PPM) for Transporting Personal Property. (Formerly the DITYMove Program).  (JFTR, par. U5320-D and JFTR, Vol. 1, Air Force Supplemental, Uniformed ServicePersonnel). 5.23.1.  General.  The PPM program was initiated to provide members or next of kin of a deceasedmember an alternative method of moving HHG while offering a monetary incentive to save govern-ment funds.  The following conditions apply: 5.23.1.1.  The member must have an order authorizing movement of HHG. 5.23.1.2.  The member or representative must be counseled by the TMO prior to a PPM. 5.23.1.3.  For transoceanic shipments under this program see JFTR, Vol. 1, Air Force Supplemen-tal, Uniformed Service Personnel. 5.23.1.4.  PPMs are strictly voluntary. 5.23.2.  Impact on Other PCS Entitlements.  When the member and/or dependents ride to the destina-tion in the rental vehicle or a POC, which is used for the PPM, they are authorized both the PPMallowances and MALT PLUS per diem for the authorized POCs (including rental vehicles).  Therental vehicle or POC, used for the PPM, is one of the two authorized POCs. 5.23.3.  Payments.  For documentation requirements and procedures, see Chapter 8. 5.23.4.  PPM Expenses Exceeding 95 Percent Limitation.  When a member incurs PPM expenses thatexceed the 95 percent limit, reimbursement is payable for actual expenses NTE Government Con-structed Cost. 5.24.  Transportation Services Directly Procured by the Member with a Commercial Company.(AF Supplement/JFTR, Volume 1).  A member or next of kin of a deceased member may ship the mem-ber's HHG at personal expense and claim reimbursement for actual cost of shipment NTE the governmentconstructed cost. 5.25.  Services Not Reimbursable:  5.25.1.  Services performed before receipt of orders.  (In cases of emergency or of service exigency,when documented by claimant's commander maybe exceptions).  A statement from the PCS order–issuing official or designated representative must be used to substantiate reimbursement for a PCSmove the member claims to have been advised orders would be issued (JFTR, par. U5330-G). 5.25.2.  Storage in transit after the first 90 days when conditions were not beyond control of the mem-ber or incident to transportation. 5.25.3.  Storage incident to a temporary change of station other than as provided in the JFTR. 5.25.4.  Commercial storage when government facilities are available.  Claimant is responsible forascertaining availability of government facilities. Section 5D—Transportation of Privately Owned Motor Vehicle (POV). 5.26.  Policy. (JFTR, par. U5413).  Delivery or pick-up of a POV concurrent with PCS is defined as anyvehicle transportation action performed entirely within a separate leg of PCS travel.  All other vehicletransportation actions are considered non-concurrent (see Figure 5.3. and Figure 5.4.). AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005475.26.1.  Concurrent. (JFTR, pars. U5413-C, D, and E). 5.26.2.  Non-Concurrent.  Members are authorized to transportation allowances according to JFTR,par. U5413-B, for transportation of a vehicle to or from a VPC/port by any means (commercial or per-sonally procured).  For the purpose of receiving transportation allowances, there are no restrictions asto who may deliver or pick up the vehicle.  Note:  Members are not authorized to government-pro-cured transportation for this travel. 5.27.  Processing Time. The member is due one day for POV processing at the vehicle port/VPC in addi-tion to the day at the APOD.  Normally, per diem is not authorized.  MALT PLUS is payable for the addi-tional travel time when authorized delays occur as outlined in par. 5.10. of this instruction. 5.28.  Shipment of POV at Personal Expense. (JFTR, par. U5425-B). 5.29.  Determination of Vehicle Port/VPC. (JFTR, par. U5435, and AF Supplement/JFTR, Volume 1).The vehicle port/VPC to which transportation entitlements are authorized is the port nearest the old ornew duty station or a port/VPC between the old and new duty station.  Contact TMO to determine theappropriate vehicle port/VPC. 5.30.  Restrictions. (JFTR, par. U5435-B).  Travel and transportation allowances are authorized only inconnection with the shipment of authorized vehicles.  If more than one vehicle is shipped (one at govern-ment expense and one or more at personal expense), transportation allowances for delivery/pickup areonly authorized for the vehicle shipped at government expense (DD Form 788 or the member's statementaccompanied by a copy of the commercial firm's receipt). Section 5E—POV Storage when POV Transportation is not Authorized. (JFTR, Chapter 5, Part E, Section 2). 5.31.  Eligibility. Members with an effective date of PCS orders of 1 April 1997 or later are eligible forthis entitlement. Section 5F—Mobile Home Allowance.

Ifavailable transportation or MTs are not used, no reimbursement is authorized unless approved by theorder-issuing official.  If transportation and MTs are not available, member is authorized to TDYallowances. 6.2.2.  Approval for Payment.  The responsible Air Force recruiting squadron commander certifiesapproval for payment of travel and/or transportation allowances authorized in this paragraph in ItemIV, DD Form 1351, Travel Voucher or item 21a, DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher, asapplicable. 6.3.  Reimbursement of Expenses Incurred in Performance of Official Recruiting Duty. (JFTR, par.U7030)  Out-of-pocket recruiting expenses are reimbursable.  Such reimbursement is for personnelassigned within the recruiting service who are actively engaged in recruiting Air Force members.  ForReserve recruiter expenses of an unusual nature, request for determinations should be referred to HQAFRC/RS, 155 Richard Ray Boulevard, Robins AFB, GA 31098-1635. 6.4.  Air Crews. (JFTR, par. U7100).  Flight crews engaged in scheduled air transport operations or train-ing for such duties are authorized to travel and transportation allowances under JFTR, Chapter 4, withoutspecific travel orders (47 Comp Gen. 477 (1968)).  JFTR, Chapter 3, Parts C and E apply at locationsother than the PDS.  A signature from the aircraft or squadron commander after the travel completionmust be included either on the original voucher or copy of the attached flight order. 6.5.  Commuting Area Travel any Tour Less than 20 Weeks. (JFTR, par. U7150). 6.5.1.  No per diem or actual expense allowances are payable between the home or place from whichthe Reserve Component (RC) member is called to active duty and the permanent duty station in caseswhere the RC member commutes daily between home, or place from which call is to active duty, andthe permanent duty station.  RC members are authorized mileage reimbursement of one round trip foreach consecutive tour outside of corporate limits. 6.5.2.  RC members who are within the commuting area (but outside the corporate limits) but are pre-cluded from commuting due to the nature of the duty are authorized to reimbursement for occasionalmeals not to exceed the proportional rate and/or quarters in accordance with JFTR, par. U4510-B. Example:  Member ordered to active duty: 1-5 Sep will commute.  On 2 Sep, ordered to work untilproject is completed.  Worked: 0800 hrs, 2 Sep and required to remain overnight at duty location until1300 hrs, 3 Sep.

No per diem is payable if both gov-ernment quarters and mess are available (JFTR, par. U7150-A1c).  When the member presents animpracticability or adverse effects statement covering all or part of the training period, or if AFMAN34-255 (http://www.dtic.mil/perdiem) shows government quarters or meals as not available, perdiem is authorized according to JFTR, par. U1045 and JFTR, Chapter 4, Parts B, C, or E, as applica-ble.  Since a training location is a permanent duty station, members on annual training are not in atravel status while at the training location. 6.6.2.  Multiple Annual Tour Locations.  In the case of multiple annual tour locations, each location isnot always a PDS.  The nature of the duty determines whether a location is considered a PDS or TDYstation.  A TDY station can be reflected by either a separate TDY order (or flight authorization) ormay be stated on the call to duty order by stating "with further TDY to...”.  The following scenariosare used for clarification: 6.6.2.1.  A member called to active duty to perform an annual tour at the unit of assignment is notauthorized per diem.  Any travel away from the annual tour location is TDY and per diem is pay-able. 6.6.2.2.  A member, called to the unit of assignment only for the purpose of obtaining onwardtransportation to the actual annual tour location, would have both locations reflected as an annualtour location or PDS.  Per diem would not be payable if government quarters and meals are avail-able. 6.6.2.3.  A member who travels from home (or place from which called to active duty) to one ormore annual tour locations and then returns to home (or place from which called to active duty)without returning to the prime duty location has more than one PDS.  Each station would be anannual tour location and per diem would not be payable if Government quarters and meals areavailable. 6.6.3.  Travel within and adjacent to Permanent Duty and TDY Stations.  JFTR, Chapter 7, Part G, andChapter 4 of this instruction apply. 6.6.3.1.  Duty at all Locations for Less than 20 Weeks.

Consecutive Overseas Tour (COT) Leave Travel/In Place Consecutive Overseas Tour(IPCOT). (JFTR, par. U7200).  COT leave travel must be authorized in the member's orders.  Travel isauthorized to the home of record (HOR) or a place not to exceed the cost to the HOR.  (Exception:  TheSecretary of the Air Force has authorization to approve any place according to JFTR, par. U7200-A3b).The HOR must be stated in the orders. 6.12.1.  Travel Time for COT Travel.  Travel time for COT travel is computed the same as normalPCS travel according to JFTR, par. U5160.  Each separate leg of the journey is computed indepen-dently with travel time allowed for each leg based on the mode(s) used per the JFTR, par. U5160.(See Figure 6.1. and Figure 6.2.). 6.12.2.  Deferred COT. 6.12.2.1.  The COT leave travel entitlement is meant to be used between the losing and gainingPDS.  However, if due to service emergencies the member, who must traverse CONUS to get totheir new PDS, cannot use the COT leave travel entitlement en route, the losing commander canauthorize a deferment.  See par. 6.13.2.4 for members who do not have to traverse CONUS to getto their new PDS.  The deferment approval must be based on mission reasons, not the personalpreference of the member.  The losing commander must evaluate the need to defer the membersCOT leave travel entitlement on an individual basis.  The losing commander is the only approvalauthority for COT leave travel deferment for members.  This is not a rubber stamp program.  Thelosing commander must evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the need to defer the member’s COTleave travel based solely on service exigencies.  Examples of service exigencies include extrememanning shortages at the losing station, the need to avoid disruption of dependent school sched-ules if the member is required to rotate during the school term, or immediate reporting require-ments at the new PDS.  When granting a COT deferment the losing commander must consider themember’s report-not-later-than date (RNLTD), date eligible for return from overseas (DEROS),and whether mission reasons prevent the member from taking at least 11 days of leave en route.This does not preclude the losing commander from authorizing leave (non-COT) en route duringAFI65-114   26 AUGUST 200565the PCS.  If the losing commander determines the member cannot be released for 11 days or moreof leave en route and still allow the member to meet the RNLTD, then a deferment of the COTleave travel entitlement may be justified.  If the losing commander determines that a deferment isauthorized, and the member wants to take leave (non-COT) en route, the losing commander mustauthorize the member leave (non-COT) en route.  This determination is based on, but not limitedto mission requirements, when the member can depart the old PDS, and the RNLTD at the newPDS.  The PCS orders must reflect the authorization to defer the COT leave travel entitlement andthe authorization (if applicable) to take leave (non-COT) en route.  If the member can take at least11 days or more en route, the COT leave travel entitlement has been used. NOTE: The number of non-COT leave days the member can take en route is limited to 10 days.  Mem-bers who had their COT leave travel entitlement deferred but exceeded the 10-day leave limitation mayrequest a review of their circumstances.  Members must submit a written request for review through theirchain of command to AF/DPPC.  The reason for exceeding the 10-day leave limitation must be based onreasons beyond the member’s control.  Members must remember that if the exception to policy is grantedany reimbursement for PCS COT leave travel must be paid back to the government. 6.12.2.2.  If a member is authorized to defer COT leave travel by the losing commander, the fol-lowing statement must be included on the PCS order, “Member and/or dependents are authorizedto defer their COT leave travel entitlement”.  If en route leave is granted, an additional statementmust be included to read “Member is authorized to take not more than 10 days of leave en route inconjunction with the COT deferment”.  If a member exceeds the authorized en route leave days,the COT leave entitlement has been used. NOTE: The deferral of COT leave does not qualify or allow a member to carry more than 60 days ofleave from one fiscal year to the next. 6.12.2.3.  Members who must traverse CONUS on their way to new PDSs are expected to use theirCOT leave travel entitlement en route.  Members traverse the CONUS if they pass across, over, orthrough the CONUS.  If the member is unable to use the COT leave travel entitlement en route dueto mission reasons and the losing commander has granted a deferment of the COT leave travelentitlement, the deferment should begin within 6 months of the end of the new tour.  Examples:Members going PCS from Ramstein AB, Germany to Osan AB, Korea; members going PCS fromElmendorf AFB, AK to Ramstein AB, Germany; or members going PCS from Southwest Asia toMisawa AB, JA would have to obtain their losing commanders approval in order to defer COTleave travel. 6.12.2.4.  Members authorized COT leave travel entitlement that do not traverse the CONUS totheir new PDS, do not have to obtain the losing commanders permission for COT leave traveldeferment.  Members must remember that the COT leave travel entitlement should begin within 6months of the end of the new tour.  Examples:  Members going PCS from Ramstein AB, Germanyto Lakenheath AB, UK and members going PCS from Eielson AFB, AK to Elmendorf AFB, AKwould not have to obtain their losing commanders approval for deferment. NOTE: The Major Commands (MAJCOMs) on a case by case may waive the 6-month rule. 6.12.2.5.  Limitations on Reimbursement: 6.12.2.5.1.  Members and command-sponsored dependents who qualify for the COT travel andtransportation allowances are paid from the members old PDS to the member’s HOR to themember’s new PDS, or in the case of deferment, from the member’s new PDS to the member’s66AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005HOR to the member’s new PDS.  Authorized travelers can travel to any other location; how-ever, reimbursement is limited to the round trip cost to the members HOR.  IPCOT travel andtransportation allowances are paid from member’s current PDS to the member’s HOR andreturn.  Authorized travelers can travel to any other location; however, reimbursement is lim-ited to the round trip cost to the members HOR.  Tours and cruise packages are not authorizedfor reimbursement in connection with COT/IPCOT leave travel.  All travelers must contacttheir local Transportation Management Office/(Contracted) Commercial Travel Office (TMO/CTO) to make travel arrangements and receive information on travel restrictions for transoce-anic travel.  Failure to contact the TMO/CTO may result in non-reimbursement of self-pro-cured travel. 6.12.2.5.2.  Members and command-sponsored dependents in Alaska authorized COT/IPCOTare limited to reimbursement for government procured air travel.  Members can file a waiverrequest to allow travel by privately owned conveyance versus government air travel.  Mem-bers must submit a written justification to the local MPF for approval by HQ PACAF/DP. 6.13.  Extended Hospitalization Resulting in Permanent Change of Station (PCS). (JFTR, par.U7252).  An attendant for a military member is authorized applicable travel allowance during the timespent at the medical facility.  If it is determined to assign the patient to the hospital (PCS), the attendant'sentitlement to lodging plus/actual expenses will end at 2400 hours on the day after the patient has beennotified of the reassignment. 6.14.  Funded Rest and Recuperative (R&R) Leave Transportation. (JFTR, par. U7300).  Issuance oftransportation must be supported by a special order.  Include in the order: 6.14.1.  Statement that special 15-day leave and space-required transportation to and from R&R desti-nation is authorized. 6.14.2.  Fund citation (unit O&M funds). 6.14.3.  Customer identification code (CIC) for AMC airlift. 6.14.4.  Dates travel are to begin and end. 6.15.  Disciplinary Travel. (JFTR, par. U7450).  Members traveling incident to disciplinary action arenot authorized per diem.  Included is travel for the purpose of court-martial or non-judicial punishmentproceedings, including consulting with defense counsel. 6.16.

Statutory Authority and Limitations.  7.1.1.  The General Accounting Office Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agen-cies, Fiscal Procedures, Title 7, Chapter 7, paragraph 7.4e, and Appendix iii, prescribe the author-ity and liabilities of statistical sampling used in prepayment examination.  In summary, the public lawson statistical sampling provide that FSOs and their certifying officers, acting in good faith, will not beheld liable with respect to any certification or payment on a voucher which is not subject to examina-tion because of the prescribed sampling procedures, provided that such officer and the DefenseFinance and Accounting Service have diligently pursued collection action to recover illegal, improper,or incorrect payments as prescribed by the Comptroller General. 7.1.2.  Maximum Dollar Limits.  The head of each agency may approve the use of statistical samplingfor prepayment examination of disbursement vouchers for amounts not in excess of $2,500 pervoucher. 7.1.3.  Travel Voucher Certification.  For Customer Service sections where 100 percent audit is notperformed, certifying officers will use the internal sampling feature in IATS/RTS.  The system param-eters must be set at a minimum of 10% audit for all travel claims processed.  All travel claims over$2,500 require audit. 7.2.  Definitions:  7.2.1.  Prepayment examination - audit of a voucher prior to the payment.  Does not apply to advancetravel payments. 7.2.2.  Total entitlement - the amount on the "Total Entitlement" line in the Summary of Paymentblock on the voucher before any advance or accrued payments are deducted.  Does not include trans-portation expenses, such as GTRs, MTAs, TWs, etc., not paid directly to the traveler. 7.2.3.  Trainee - person not fully qualified to perform a function. 7.2.4.  Statistical sampling - used when you want to determine the magnitude of a problem in a totalpopulation given that it is not economical to perform a 100 percent audit.  And, where it is desirable tohave a very high degree of confidence that the audit results would measure the population characteris-tic with a predictable precision.  Statistical sampling requires random sampling to eliminate personalbiases from the selection process. 7.2.5.  Random sampling - a method of selecting settlement vouchers for prepayment audit thatassures each qualifying voucher in a consecutive group has equal chance of selection.  Random num-ber tables, tossing a die, spinning a dial with five numbers, computer assisted number generator, orother unbiased methods are available.  Please note that sequential sampling of every fifth voucher isnot random sampling, and is not approved for these prepayment audits. 7.3.  Areas Approved.  7.3.1.  Statistical sampling must be used for all travel settlement vouchers with total entitlement of$2,500 or less, and not computed by a trainee. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005737.3.2.  Major Command Directors of Accounting and Finance or FSOs may determine a limit less than$2,500 per voucher. 7.4.  Implementation. It is mandatory for FSOs to use these continuous sampling procedures.  MajorCommands should monitor implementation of these procedures; however, FSOs must keep all documen-tation as prescribed by 7.6.2.4. 7.5.  Payment Sampling and Review of Settled Travel Claims.  7.5.1.  A pre-payment examination (audit) is required to ensure that travel vouchers contain the neces-sary substantiation and documentation for lawful and proper payment.  Perform these audits on alltravel vouchers $2,500 and over, and on a statistical sampling of vouchers less than $2,500.  Areas toexamine are: 7.5.1.1.  Payment is permitted by law and applicable instructions. 7.5.1.2.  Required administrative authorizations and approvals for payment are obtained. 7.5.1.3.  Request for payment is supported by basic documents. 7.5.1.4.  Name and address of payee, as verified by database, is correct. 7.5.1.5.  Manual calculations are correct or appropriate and correct data is put into automated com-putation systems. 7.5.1.6.  All transactions are properly charged to the correct appropriation. 7.5.1.7.  Appropriations are available at the time to support disbursement.  (Indicated by appropri-ate signatures on orders.) 7.5.1.8.  Special certificates or receipts are attached to the voucher, as required. 7.5.1.9.  Duplicate payments are prevented through proper manual or automated edits and checks.(See Figure 7.1.) 7.5.2.  In preparing to select claims for random audit, estimate the number of claims expected to beprocessed for the current month.  Use past data, such as an average of the past three months, to makethis estimate.  The estimate is needed to determine the sample size and sample selection criteria.  Useonly claims under $2,500 for this estimate, as only claims under $2,500 may be randomly audited.  Allclaims $2,500 and over (excluding transportation costs) must be audited. 7.5.3.  The chart in Figure 7.4. provides the approximate sample size based upon the estimated totalnumber of claims for the given month.  If the estimated total number of claims subject to sampling isless than 50, then review all claims.  For example, if the estimated number of TDY claims is 2,000, thesample size will be about 95.  The sampling interval would be 21 in this example.  A random startfrom 1 to 21 would be selected.  Every 21st claim would be selected for audit until the entire popula-tion (2,000) was exhausted and the total sample (95) achieved.  Note that the actual sample size willprobably vary from the estimate.  Also note that your sampling interval remains the same during themonth.  At the beginning of the next month a different sampling interval may be used based on arevised estimate of the population size. 74AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20057.5.4.  Paragraph 7.5.3. of this instruction reflects a manual sampling interval/selection process.  TheDirectorate for Finance and Accounting Systems Transition is testing the automated systems to ensuretheir sampling procedures correspond to the procedures approved by DFAS-HQ. 7.5.4.1.  If you use the Integrated Automated Travel System (IATS), use the instructions above andthe chart following the checklist to estimate your population and sample size.  After determiningthose amounts, divide your sample size by the population to get the percent of vouchers to beaudited.  Go into IATS maintenance (percentages and constants) and insert the appropriate per-centage.  Also, ensure the parameter for dollar threshold audit is set at $2,500.00. 7.5.4.2.  If you use another automated travel system, ensure the system’s random selection proce-dure gives each voucher under $2,500 an equal chance of selection for audit.  Ensure you use themethod in 7.5.3. when estimating the population and determining the sample size.  If this is thecase, you may use the automated auditing capability of your system to select your vouchers to beaudited. 7.5.4.3.  If your systems do not meet the above criteria, you must use the manual method until yoursystems are enhanced to meet DFAS-HQ guidelines.  If you are on a system other than IATS, anddo not know if your system meets the above criteria, contact your systems component for informa-tion. 7.5.5.  Automated systems currently flag vouchers for auditing and release the block to the lead clerkor travel supervisor for audit.  The lead clerk or travel supervisor continues to perform this function.However, the auditor will use the checklist at the end of this message when reviewing the travelclaims selected for audit.  If a claim contains a discrepancy not listed on the checklist, list it as a mis-cellaneous error, either TDY (Category 15) or PCS (Category 14), and specify the reason for error ona separate sheet.  These checklists are part of the mandatory reporting procedures, when released bySAF/FM. 7.5.6.  The checklists referred to in par. 7.5.5. of this instruction follows.  It provides a list of items thatshould be reviewed in the for monthly population sizes greater 7,000, the sampling interval is aboutequal to the population size divided by 100.  For example, if the number of TDY vouchers processedeach month is approximately 7,500, then the sampling interval is 75, the sampling frequency is 1/75and the total number of TDY vouchers selected for audit is about 100. 7.5.7.  DFAS-DE Field Sites have no responsibility in monitoring Air Force travel computationpre-payment audit and reporting requirements. 7.6.  Documentation Requirements.  7.6.1.  Vouchers examined must carry evidence of the examination.  When a voucher has an "auditedby" block and that voucher is examined under these procedures, the "audited by" block must be ini-tialed, otherwise this block is left blank.  When a voucher requires certification, such as SF Form1164, the word "audited" is included above the signature; otherwise a signature only is required. 7.6.2.  Monthly summary reports, supported by worksheets, are prepared for review and analysis bythe FSO.  The FSO uses these reports to determine whether to continue the prepayment audit proce-dures, or whether to limit use of the procedures to certain technicians, or specific types of payments,and whether corrective action to minimize errors is appropriate and adequate. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005757.6.2.1.  Audit log worksheets may consist of copies of voucher logs, spreadsheet forms, or com-puter-generated products. 7.6.2.2.  Whatever method is used, the audit log must be in original order of receipt of vouchers forprocessing.  It must include all vouchers, not just the settlement vouchers or those within the dollarlimit set by the FSO/Field Site for prepayment audit sampling.  This ensures the documentationsupports the sample plan and shows which vouchers were excluded from the sampling and why(such as, advance payment, disbursements over the dollar limit above, or voucher processed bytrainees).  The following minimum data are required. 7.6.2.2.1.  Voucher identification of each voucher examined.  Employee last name and SSNshould be used as a minimum, since the voucher is audited prior to assigning a voucher num-ber for payment. 7.6.2.2.2.  Total dollars disbursed for the month.  This allows the FSOs/Field Sites to projectthe total impact of discrepancies (errors) on their total account. 7.6.2.2.3.  Identification of computation technician. 7.6.2.2.4.  Dollar value of each error. 7.6.2.2.5.  Type or cause of each error noted on examined vouchers. 7.6.2.3.  Summary report at a minimum should include (See Figure 7.2.): 7.6.2.3.1.  Total number of payment vouchers for the month. 7.6.2.3.2.  Total dollars disbursed for the month. 7.6.2.3.3.  Total number of payment vouchers audited. 7.6.2.3.4.  Total number of errors found on audited vouchers. 7.6.2.3.5.  Total dollar voucher of errors found. 7.6.2.3.6.  The most common types, causes, and sources of errors (such as mathematical, orfailure to allow a reimbursement, etc.). 7.6.2.3.7.  Types of corrective action taken to reduce errors, and sources of errors, to a mini-mum.  Types of corrective action should be summarized by types of payments:  Member PCS,Dependent PCS, Vicinity Travel, One Location TDY, Many Locations TDY, and any other cat-egories of travel that would be helpful in documenting improvements over time, which resultfrom the corrective action. 7.6.2.3.8.  Report observations.  These can be either positive or negative possible trends,changes in volume, etc. 7.6.2.3.9.  Under the Total Quality Management philosophy, report the following to appropri-ate management level: training needs, equipment or other resource problems, and processingor systems improvements needed. 7.6.2.4.  Summary reports, with attachments pertaining to this voucher examination, should bereadily available for examination by auditors from DoD, GAO, or Air Force Inspectors, and otherappropriate officials.  Consult AFMAN 37-139, Records Disposition Schedule, for file retentioninstructions. 76AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005Figure 7.1.  Example of a Control Log.

Nonavailability of a Directed Transportation Mode: 8.13.3.1.  General.  If orders direct travel by a specific transportation mode, but that mode is notavailable, a certificate of non-availability is needed to support payment of MALT or reimburse-ment of actual transportation cost.  The traffic management office (TMO) at the location fromwhich the member departs must issue the certificate (see AFI 24-101).  Show on the certificate thecapacity in which the officer signs and the base or organization for which the officer is acting.  Ifa directed mode is not available at departure time, an amendment to the travel order should bepublished to delete this requirement if the non-availability statement cannot be obtained. 8.13.3.2.  Military Air Directed. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005878.13.3.2.1.  If military air is directed but not available and TRs are furnished, this certificate isnot required. 8.13.3.2.2.

The legal office determineswhether the damage occurred while in the performance of official business.  If damageoccurred while the traveler was performing official business, then reimbursement of the fullamount claimed, not to exceed the deductible amount contained in the rental agreement, isauthorized.  If the damage occurred while on other than official business, then reimbursementis not authorized.  The FSO is responsible for final approval of the claim. 8.13.4.3.2.  Claims received by the FSO from a rental car agency or the traveler (when no per-sonal funds have been paid) must be forwarded to the local legal office.  The legal office deter-mines whether the damage occurred while in the performance of official business or if willfuland wanton negligence on the part of the traveler was involved.  If damage occurred while per-forming official business, direct payment for the full amount of the claim not to exceed thedeductible amount contained in the rental agreement is authorized to the rental car agency.  Ifthe rental car agency is listed on the MTMC agreement and the damage to the rental vehicle isdue to willful and wanton negligence on the part of the traveler, then the rental car agencyshould be reimbursed or paid for the full cost of repairs to the vehicle.  If the damage occurredon other than official business, direct payment to the rental car agency in the full amount of thedamage is authorized; however, the amount paid by the Government must be collected fromthe traveler determined responsible (68 Comp. Gen. 309, B-232352, March 7, 1989).  TheFSO is responsible for final approval of the claim and for pursuing collection action againstthe responsible traveler. 8.13.4.3.3.  If a third party is liable (including the traveler's private insurer), the local legaloffice may assert a claim under the provisions of AFI 51-502.  Travelers are required to sign astatement that they are aware that any reimbursement for the rental vehicle repair cost receivedfrom the rental agency, private insurance, or responsible third party is the property of the AirForce.  The reimbursement must be remitted to the FSO unless the traveler paid the repair costto the rental car agency with personal funds and was not reimbursed by the Air Force. 8.13.5.

Use of a facsimile signaturedoes not alter the responsibility of the person whose signature is used. 8.14.4.  Delegated Authority for Signing Administrative Statements.  The term designee, as used inthis instruction, generally means a person authorized to sign documents or correspondence.  The des-ignee signs for the person who has basic responsibility.

Charge per diem, including the lodging costs, to the accounting classification/FYapplicable to each day. 8.19.2.  Reimbursable Expenses.  Charge reimbursable expenses, other than transportation expenses,to the accounting classification/FY current at the time the expense is paid by the traveler.  Expensesthat are incurred over a period of time, such as rental vehicles, are averaged over the period of timeand charge on a daily basis to the accounting classification/FY applicable to each day. 8.19.3.  Transportation Expenses (POC).  This applies to monetary allowance in lieu of transportation(MALT).  In determining the accounting classification/FY to charge, divide the travel portion of theTDY into legs:  PDS to TDY station; between TDY stations; and TDY station to PDS.  Charge theaccounting classification applicable when a particular leg begins.  If leave is authorized, charge theaccounting classification current on the first day of allowable travel for the leg. 8.19.4.  Travel Involving Two FYs. 8.19.4.1.

After FY-end closeout, establish an obligation for the amount expected to be earned inthe new FY.  Do not adjust the advance payment. 8.19.4.4.  The paying FSO adjusts the portion of the advance paid at the time of settlement as fol-lows. 8.19.4.5.  Subtract the advance from the entitlements earned against the accounting classificationthe advance was originally paid out of. Example: Advance paid in FY 00 $600 Total entitlement earned in FY 00: $400 Total entitlement earned in FY 01: $210 Amount due traveler: $10 Record transactions in the accounting classification: 5703400 300 XXXX XXXXXX XX 409 XXXXXX ($200.00) 5713400 301 XXXX XXXXXX XX 409 XXXXXX  $210.00 8.19.4.6.  Ensure the net adjustments processed in the internal records agree with adjustmentsmade in the accounting classification. 8.19.4.7.  Examples of input for BQ and processing instructions are in DFAS 7077.2-M, Section30. 92AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20058.19.4.8.  Line item accounting on for-others and CMA settlement or supplemental travel vouch-ers is required to allow accountable stations to record expenses against the proper accounting clas-sification and financial data elements.  Under the voucherless travel system, vouchers are notforwarded to the accountable station; therefore, it is critical for the paying FSO to process the enti-tlement expenses to the proper accounting classification and financial data elements. 8.20.  Refusal of Amount Due. When the settlement voucher is computed and the traveler refuses toaccept all or part of the total amount due, process the voucher as prescribed below: 8.20.1.  If the traveler offers the refused amount as a gift to the Air Force, collect the gift into receiptaccount 571299, Gifts to the United States Not Otherwise Classified (see AFI 51-601): 8.20.1.1.  The traveler signs for the total amount due. 8.20.1.2.  Prepare DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, with the normal entries.

By authority of the Secretary of the Air Force,I accept with pleasure your gift of $(amount) pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2601.  Thank you for yourkindness and generosity.  Sincerely yours, (Authorized Signature)." 8.20.1.5.  Give the traveler completed copies of the disbursement and collection vouchers. 8.20.1.6.

U5130-A1). 8.26.2.1.  The limitation for travel and transportation reimbursement and the shipment of house-hold goods (HHG) costs must be based on the same CONUS location.  The point, which is mostadvantageous for travel purposes, is not always the point most advantageous for the shipment ofHHG.  Follow these steps: 8.26.2.2.  At the retirement briefing, MPFs should advise members who elect to retire in an over-seas location to contact their local FSO for assistance and counseling on determining and docu-menting the CONUS point on which their travel and transportation entitlement is to be based. 8.26.2.3.  The FSO should counsel the member on entitlements according to JFTR, par.U5130-A1.

The retiree should be sent to TMO for counseling.  The TMO determines the point mostadvantageous for the shipment of HHG.  The TMO provides the member with the estimated costfor the shipment of HHG to the overseas HOS, the point mentioned above and the point selectedby the FSO based on the member's estimated weight of HHG.  The retiree should be sent back tothe FSO. 8.26.2.5.  The FSO determines the member's travel entitlements to the point selected as mostadvantageous for shipment of HHG.  At this time the retiree must select a CONUS point that ismost advantageous when considering HHG shipment and travel entitlements.  This point must bedocumented and used by the TMO and FSO for entitlement purposes. Section 8B—Dependent Travel 8.27.

It isdepartmental policy that travel advances are not authorized unless an exception is granted to the standardpractice of the traveler using his or her individual government travel card or the traveler is an infrequenttraveler and does not have a government travel card.  Individuals who have a government travel card mustobtain their cash needs via the travel card ATM.  Personnel who do not have the government travel cardmust obtain advances through EFT.  All Air Force military and civilian employees with the governmenttravel card that travel, including permanent change station (PCS), are strongly encouraged to use the cardfor expenses incurred during official travel.  Cardholders must charge lodging expenses in connectionwith official travel, including destination point and while en route.  Lodging expenses charged to the cardmust be in support of government travel only.  Cardholders may charge transportation expenses, localground transportation, and rental car expenses authorized on travel orders.  Such transportation must be insupport of government business only.  Cardholders may charge meal expenses in connection with officialtravel only while away from their home installation, including while en route to or from their travel loca-tion.  Cards may be used during a PCS.  Cardholders in a PCS status must assure that all card charges arepaid in a timely manner.  If the PCS will take more than 45 days, cardholders are allowed an EFT advanceto their financial institution to cover card charges. 9.3.  Unique Requirements:  9.3.1.  Separation/Retirement.  A member who is separating or retiring can be paid an EFT advanceincidental to separation/retirement no more than 10 workdays prior to the member and/or depen-dent(s) actual travel dates.  Retirees and their dependents may be advanced one hundred percent of theamount computed under 9.5.2. below.  For separation travel, other than those members serving lessthan ninety percent of their initial prescribed period of service, the member may be advanced MALTor transportation cost for personal travel only and seventy five percent of the applicable MALT ortransportation cost only for the dependents.  Per diem is not authorized in advance.  For members sep-arating with less than ninety percent prescribed service of their initial enlistment, see JFTR, pars.U5165 and U5250 for advances and JFTR, par. U5125 for entitlements.  For members separatingunder other than honorable conditions, see JFTR, par. U5165. 9.3.1.1.  If the retiree selects an overseas HOS see Figure 9.4. for a sample letter for the retiree toaccomplish with the help of the FSO and TMO.  This letter documents the member's selection ofthe CONUS point on which their travel and transportation entitlement will be based.  This lettershould be accomplished in four copies.  The original should be held at the TMO and the otherthree are retained by the member, two of which are to filed with the member’s advance and settle-ment voucher. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20051099.3.1.2.  Separatees must indicate in section V (DD Form 1351) the city and state of their intendeddestination. 9.3.2.  Group Advances.

Also, write the amount ofthe advance and the appropriate accounting classification on each travel order, if more than one ispresent.  Give a copy of the order to the cashier who will enter the payment data on either a DD Form1351-1 or DD Form 1351-6.  The FSO balances with the cashier and prepares a DD Form 1351-coversheet. 9.3.3.  Civilian Employee Permanent Change of Station.  Employees are to maximize use of the GTCfor PCS travel.  If an employee does not have a GTC an EFT advance by the FSO may be made.Advances covering employee PCS moves are to be made in incremental amounts to meet reimburs-able expenses as they are expected to occur.  Advances should be processed at the losing station foronly those allowances, which the employee expects to incur a related expense concurrent with travelto the new PDS.  Each allowance being advanced must be identified on the payment voucher alongwith the dollar amount paid.  The following entitlement codes are used to record the payment into theaccounting system, at the accountable station, and may be used in lieu of the entitlement name to iden-tify the allowance being advanced on the payment voucher: EM - Employee Travel DP - Dependent Travel HH - House-hunting Trip TQ - Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense HG - Household Goods Shipment/Storage (not involving GBL) MH - Mobile Home Movement (not involving GBL) Advances for any other PCS allowances are not authorized.  To prevent possible overpayments whenthe settlement is processed, advances computed for Temporary Quarters Subsistence Expense Allow-ance or Household Goods Shipment/Storage should be reduced by twenty eight percent to offset anypotential tax liability. 9.4.  Payment of Advance Travel Allowances  9.4.1.  General.  When a request for advance is submitted to the FSO, advise the traveler that any debtresulting from the receipt of the advance is subject to deduction from their payroll account.

This notice may be provided on theadvance payment voucher, or by any other means deemed appropriate by the FSO.  Acknowledgment(signature) by the traveler is not required.  The travel advance payment cannot exceed the estimatecost of the official travel.  All TDY advances should be paid by the member’s home station except incases of emergency. 110AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 20059.4.2.  Mobile Home Allowance.  If the member is unable to use the government charge card for ship-ment of the mobile home, the member can request an EFT advance.  The member's request for EFTadvanced payment of mobile home allowances must be supported by a written statement from theTMO showing the points between which the shipment is authorized based on the member's permanentchange of station orders and what it would cost to ship the member's prescribed household goodsallowance at government expense between such points.  Procedures covering advance payment ofmobile home allowance for employees are in JTR, par. C1101 and for members are in JFTR, par.U5560. 9.4.3.  Dependent Travel.

Thepaying FSO sends the voucher information by message within two days of payment to the deceasedmember’s servicing FSO. 9.4.4.  Return of Absentees, Stragglers, Deserters or Other Members without Funds.  JFTR, par.U7400, permits an FSO to advance funds to an absentee, straggler, deserter or other members withoutfunds.  The funds may equal cost of meal tickets (MTs) and/or government procured transportation(formerly called TRs) necessary for travel to the new duty station or place directed by competentauthority.  The FSO advises the member's commander of the amount advanced and the major account-ing classification from which funds were advanced.  This advance is entered on the member's mastermilitary pay account (MMPA).  When TRs and/or MTs are issued, take cost charge action prescribedin DFAS-DE Interim Guidance on Procedures for Travel Accounting Operations. 9.4.5.  Officer Training School (OTS) Advance Payments.  The losing PDS should not pay a memberan advance beyond OTS.  The member may elect to receive an advance after graduation from OTSfrom the Maxwell FSO.

The official reviewing the real estate claim of an employee whowas authorized the relocation services contract (but did not accept the appraised value offer) must disal-low dual benefits, e.g., reimbursement for appraisal fees and termite inspection. 10.23.  Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA). (JTR, Chapter 16 and DoDFMR, Vol. 9.) 10.23.1.  General. Public Law 98-151 authorizes a Relocation Income Tax (RIT) Allowance for U.S.Government civilian employees who report to their new duty station on or after 14 November 1983.Its purpose is to reimburse certain employees substantially all of the additional Federal, State, andlocal income taxes incurred by the employee as the result of certain local travel and transportationexpenses and relocation allowances which are furnished in kind, or for which reimbursement or anallowance is provided by the Government (see DoDFMR, Vol. 9).  The RITA entitlement is atwo-year, two-process calculation: 10.23.2.  Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA).  The WTA is an estimated partial payment of the finalRITA payment designed to cover federal income tax withheld from the PCS moving expense reim-bursement.  It is intended to provide an immediate offset to the tax withheld on the payment and isalso subject to withholding.  As a result, a WTA payment allows the employee to receive the samereimbursement had the withholding not been required.  DoDFMR, Vol. 9 indicates an employee mustagree in writing to repay any excess WTA amount paid in year one.  The agreement may be written onthe settlement voucher or may be a separate statement.  The statement should read similar to "I agreeto repay any excess amount of WTA paid to me in year one and submit the required certified tax infor-mation and claim for my RIT allowance within 120 days, unless an extension is granted by the com-manding officer or designee of the DoD component concerned, after the close of year one.  Iunderstand failure to comply with this requirement will preclude the DoD components payment of theWTA.  I also understand the entire WTA will be considered an excess payment if the RIT allowanceclaim is not submitted in a timely manner to settle the RIT allowance".  Note:  Year one.  The calendaryear in which the relocation expenses and resultant taxes are reimbursed to the employee.  The dollarvalue of the reimbursement will appear on the employee's W-2 as additional income. 10.23.3.  Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA).  The RITA payment is made in the calendar yearfollowing the calendar year in which the WTA is paid.  RITA is based on employee's gross compensa-tion, tax filing status, and marginal tax rates.  It reconciles the WTA payments with the employee's126AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 2005personal tax liability.  The employee must file a claim for RITA; it is not automatic.  If an employeedoes not file for the RITA in year two, the employee is liable for the additional Federal Income Taxincurred as a result of the additional income (see DoDFMR, Vol. 9).  The RIT Allowance does notcover any moving expense for which the IRS allows an exclusion.  In some instances when anemployee files the final RITA claim in the second year, he/she will be in a lesser tax bracket becauseof lower earned income.  If the RITA calculation results in a negative amount do not adjust prior yearor current year income.  The employee is obligated to repay this amount as a debt due the Governmentaccording to Collection Procedures, DoDFMR, Vol. 9.  A negative W-2 is not issued.  Advise theemployee to consult with their tax advisor for IRS procedures in handling repayments of debts.  Note:Year two.  The calendar year in which the RITA payment is made.  The dollar value of the paymentwill appear on the employee's W-2 as additional income. 10.23.4.  Tax Withholding.  Both the WTA and RITA are subject to Federal Income Tax Withholding(FITW), Federal Income Contribution Act (FICA), and Medicare.  State and local (if applicable) taxwithholding rates must be considered in the RITA computation.  However, neither is to be withheldfrom the payment to the employee. 10.23.5.  Funding.  RITA is a PCS travel settlement adjustment; therefore, normal prior year fundingprocedures apply.  That is, the reimbursable expenses of an employee transferred in the interest of theGovernment must be charged against the appropriation current when valid travel orders are issued.The organization responsible for the original funding of the move has the responsibility to secure ade-quate funds for the adjustment vouchers (65 Comp. Gen. 45 (1984)). 10.23.6.  Requirements. 10.23.6.1.  Develop a file on each employee eligible for WTA and/or RITA. 10.23.6.2.  Notify employee of the entitlement by providing a copy of AF Form 3541, RelocationIncome Tax Allowance Employee Information Handout, Figure 10.1.; a copy of AF Form 3544,Taxable Reimbursement Worksheet, Figure 10.4.; PCS Entitlements; and the Relocation IncomeTax Allowance Certification, Figure 10.3. 10.23.6.3.  Compute and process claims by referring to JTR, Chapter 16; AF Form 3539, Work-sheet for Civilian Entitlements, Figure 10.2.; AF Form 3542, Relocation Income Tax Allowance(RTIA) – Year 2 Calculation, Figure 10.5.; and AF Form 3543, Relocation Income Tax Allowance(RITA) Worksheet or the computerized RITA program. 10.23.6.4.

Doubtful Travel Claims.  12.2.1.  General.  If a traveler desires to contest a disbursing officer’s decision concerning an entitle-ment determination, the disbursing officer must assist in the submission of that claim.  It is the trav-eler’s right to have the claim forwarded for reconsideration.  The disbursing officer has theresponsibility of informing the traveler of this right.  A claim will not necessarily be denied because apart of the claim contains an element of doubt.  Process the part not in question per instructions inapplicable directives.  When partial settlement is made, the FSO states, in writing, the amount of thepartial settlement and that no further payments will be made except after certification in the name ofDOHA/GSBCA. 12.2.2.  Claim Forwarding.  FSO’s prepare the request in letterform addressed to: Military:                                 Civilian:                                     Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Claims Division PO Box 3656 Arlington, VA  22203 General Services Administration (GSA) Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA) 18th and F. Streets, NW Washington, DC  20405 150AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 200512.2.2.1.  Send three complete copies of a doubtful claim to MAJCOM/FMF for assistance.  MAJ-COMs forward unresolved claims to DFAS-IN.  The transmittal should contain a command anal-ysis of the claim, results of research, statement of policy affecting the claim, andrecommendations for approval or denial.  Send claims expiring within six years of the statute oflimitations to DFAS-IN promptly for registration with DOHA/GSBCA.  Give special handling toclaims of this type and advise addressees that registration with DOHA/GSBCA may be necessary.(See 31 U.S.C. 3526 and 3702). 12.2.3.  Documentation.  The claimant signs claims forwarded according to subparagraph 12.1.1.1.4.above.  Send with the claim as applicable: 12.2.3.1.  The claimant prepares the documents necessary for submission.  The claimant mustinclude a statement over his or her signature specifically requesting DOHA/GSBCA review. 12.2.3.2.  DD Form 1351-2, Travel Voucher or Subvoucher. 12.2.3.3.  Copies of special orders or chain of orders supporting the allowance claimed. 12.2.3.4.  DD Form 1351-5, Government Quarters and Mess, or other statements of non-availabil-ity of government quarters or government dining facility. 12.2.3.5.

For DOHA/GSBCA responsibilities, see DFAS-DE 7010.1-R 12.3.  Retroactive Amendments to Travel Orders. Retroactive amendments to increase or decrease theamount of money due the traveler must be fully justified (24 Comp Gen. 439 (1944)).  Circumstances per-mitting an amendment to authorize additional payment are so rare that claims based on them are seldomallowed.  The travel claim with the amended order should be submitted to DOHA/GSBCA through theMAJCOM and DFAS-IN, with a statement of facts and circumstances.  A written amendment confirmingan oral order is not included in this category provided the oral order was issued on or before the effectivedate of the directed change.  Support claims with a complete statement from the order-issuing authorityrelating facts and circumstances that necessitated issuance of the amended order (24 Comp Gen. 439(1944)).  If necessary, DFAS-IN will forward the claim for a final determination.  Orders may be in thiscategory even though the amended orders state the purpose is to correct an administrative error.  Wherepractical, pay locally that portion of a claim for the lesser of the entitlement accrued under the originalorder or under the amended orders and submit the balance of the claim.  In cases where the JFTR or JTRprovide for after the fact approval of miscellaneous reimbursable expenses, the order-issuing official mayapprove such expenses.  The claim is properly payable without the need to retroactively amend the order. AFI65-114   26 AUGUST 200515112.4.

Cross-Disbursement Policies. Effective October 1, 1996, the Office of the Undersecretary ofDefense, Comptroller (OUSD/C) directed the elimination of cross-disbursement of individual travel pay-ments.  Cross-disbursing means one DoD component paying a traveler using another DoD Component'sfunds.  This policy contained six exemptions to the policy. 13.2.  Exemptions embedded in the OUSD(C) policy:  13.2.1.  Travel funded by multiple funding sources, open (central) allotment, or by special centrallymanaged funds. 13.2.2.  Travel performed entirely outside the continental United States (OCONUS) or travel fundedby an activity located OCONUS but performed in CONUS (Hawaii and Alaska are consideredCONUS) for the purposes of this policy. 13.2.3.  Travel funded by special access (classified) programs. 13.2.4.  Travel required as the result of a deployment, an emergency, or a disaster. 13.2.5.  Accountable station has no disbursing capability (no Disbursing Station Symbol Number -DSSN). 13.2.6.  Travel transaction processed by a Reengineering Travel Transition Office (RTTO) pilot testsite. 13.3.  Each of the DFAS Centers, representing a DoD component, published guidance to clarify theabove OUSD/C exceptions. The exemptions are based upon who administers the funds.  Department 21is Army (DFAS-Indianapolis), Department 17 is Navy (DFAS-Cleveland) or Marines (DFAS-KansasCity), and Department 97 is DoD.  Department 97 is administered by each component.  The ADSN andlimitation determines which exemptions apply, e.g., Department 97 with an Air Force limitation theDFAS-DE exemptions apply.
