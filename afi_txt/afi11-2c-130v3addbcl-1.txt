This checklist complements AFI 11-2C-130V3, Operations Procedures, and is printed on standard 8 ½” x 11” bond paper, and trimmed to fit the standard plastic aircrew checklist binders. This checklist is intended to provide MAFFS certified crewmembers quick reference to procedures required for the safe execution of MAFFS ground and flight operations.   All MAFFS certified C-130 pilots will carry this annex. Refer recommended changes and questions about this publication to the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) using the AF IMT 847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF IMT 847s from the field through the appropriate chain of command.

The loadmaster’s  CL-4  checklists  will  not  be  called  complete  for MAFFS  missions  until  items  of  the  MAFFS  checklist  are accomplished.  The loadmaster will verbalize the setting of the Compressor  Enable  Switch  when  calling  the  CL-4  checklist complete.  As always, the checklists and these instructions are not  substitutes  for  sound  judgment  and  special  circumstances may require modifications of these procedures.
