RELEASABILITY: There are no releasability restrictions on this publication. OPR: AFFSA/A3OF  Certified by: HQ USAF/A3O-B (Mr. Steven Pennington) Pages: 36  Supersedes AFPAM 11-238, 1 Nov 05   Introduction The Aircrew Quick Reference Guide to the METAR and TAF Codes helps aircrews  quickly  and  clearly  translate  METAR  and  TAF  codes  into  plain language. See Attachment 1 for a list of source documents.    METAR reports are observed weather conditions while the TAF indicates forecast  conditions.  Both  are  lines  of  text  made  up  of  coded  data  groups separated by spaces. Some groups are not discussed because they are only intended for use by the weather community. Differences between military and civilian renderings of the code are discussed.    Aircrews should always check METAR and TAF reports thoroughly for all hazards  to  flight  safety  and  other  elements  that  may  affect  aircraft performance or mission accomplishment. When users have weather-related questions,  they  should  contact  a  certified  US  military  forecaster  or MAJCOM-approved  weather  source  for  clarification.  Weather  briefing requirements  for  USAF  Aircrews  are  spelled  out  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume 3, General Flight Rules.    Refer  recommended  changes  and  questions  about  this  publication  to  the Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the  AF  Form  847, Recommendation for Change of Publication; route AF Form 847s from the field  through  the  appropriate  functional’s  chain  of  command.  This publication may not be supplemented.   SUMMARY OF CHANGES  This  document  includes  clarifications  of  METAR  sector  visibility  and vertical  visibility  and  removes  references  to  runway  surface  conditions (now  reported  via  NOTAMs).  It  also  incorporates  several  changes  to  the TAF  format,  specifically:  repositioning  the  AMD  and  COR  modifiers  for emphasis,  adding  a  ―prepared/disseminated‖  time  group  to  military  TAFs (already  included  in  civilian  TAFs),  reformatting  of  the  TAF  valid  time groups,  noting  that  some  civilian  TAFs  are  valid  for  up  to  30  hours,  and adding  a  ―T‖  before  both  maximum  and  minimum  temperature  groups  in military TAFs.   2  Table of Contents  Section I, METAR decoding:  Report Type  Location and Date/Time Auto/Cor Wind Wind Variability Visibility Runway Visual Range Type of Weather Clouds Temperature/Dewpoint Altimeter Setting Remarks, US Remarks, Overseas Section II, TAF decoding:   Report Type  Location  Date/Time  Time and Type of Change Expected  Wind  Visibility  Type of Weather  Clouds  Wind Shear  Icing  Turbulence  Minimum Altimeter Setting  Temperatures   Figures 1.

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  This  report  is  a  METAR  (roughly  translated  from  French  as Aviation  Routine  Weather  Report)—a  scheduled  observation normally  taken  between  50-59  minutes  past  the  hour  (also referred to as a routine hourly observation). A METAR can be distinguished from a TAF by its single date/time group.  SPECI KBLV 011715Z 25015G30KT 210V290 3SM BR BKN015 01/M01 A2984 RMK SLP034  SPECI  (Aviation  Selected  Special  Weather  Report)  refers  to an  unscheduled  report  taken  when  certain  criteria  have  been met  (such  as  a  change  from  VFR  to  IFR)  and  may  be  taken anytime.                4 METAR  Location and Date/Time  How do I determine the location and the date and time of issuance?    PAAQ 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM BKN005 03/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  KCLK 291012Z AUTO 08009KT 2SM -RA SCT005 OVC009 M01/M01 A2999 RMK AO2  The  4-character  ICAO  identifier  is  the  location;  PAAQ (Palmer  Municipal)  and  KCLK  (Clinton  Regional)  are  the locations/stations in these examples.   The  7-character  group  following  the  ICAO  identifier  is  the date and time of issuance. The first two digits are the date; the last  four  digits  are  the  coordinated  universal  time  (UTC), sometimes called ―zulu time.‖    In  the  first  example,  01  is  the  1st  day  of  the  month,  and 1657Z is 1657 UTC. The second example takes place on the 29th day of the month at 1012 UTC.  When ICAO identifiers are not available or cannot be used, a 4-character  identifier  starting  with  KQ  will  be  used.    This practice  is  normally  found  in  a  contingency  environment, where  the  location/identifier  combination  is  often  classified. Consult the local weather flight for more details.     5 METAR AUTO/COR  What does AUTO and/or COR mean, if included?    Let’s look at the meanings of AUTO and COR separately.    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02A SLP034  AUTO refers to an automated observation with measurements taken by equipment such as the domestic Automated Weather Observing System  (AWOS)  or  Automated  Surface  Observation  System (ASOS),  or  the  Air  Force’s  Automated  Meteorological  Station (AMS),  also  known  as  AN/FMQ-19.  AO1  denotes  an  observation taken by equipment lacking a precipitation type discriminator (rain vs. snow). AO2 denotes an observation taken by standard equipment with  a  full  complement  of  sensors.  A02A  denotes  an  automated observation  augmented  by  a  human  observer.  Absence  of  these indicators denotes a manual report by a human observer.   KBLV 011657Z AUTO COR 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG FU BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02A SLP034 COR 1725  COR  indicates  a  corrected  observation.  Disregard  the  previous transmission. COR 1725 means that the correction was transmitted at 1725Z.          6 METAR Wind  How do I determine the wind speed and direction?    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  The data group followed by KT (knots) is the wind.    The  first  three  digits  are  the  true  direction  to  the  nearest  10 degrees from which the wind is blowing. The next two digits are  the  sustained  speed.  If  gusts  are  present,  the  next  two  or three  digits  following  the  ―G”  are  the  ―gust,‖  the  maximum wind speed in the last ten minutes.    In  this  example,  the  25015G30KT  group  is  the  wind direction  and  speed.  Here,  the  wind  is  blowing  from  250 degrees (true) at  a sustained speed of 15 knots, gusting up to 30 knots.    Calm wind is encoded as 000000KT.              7 METAR Wind Variability  How do I determine if the wind is varying between directions?    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  A  wind  variability  group  will  be  reported  if  the  wind  is variable by 60 degrees or more and the speed is greater than 6 knots.  This  remark  will  contain  the  extremes  of  the  wind directions, separated by ―V.‖    In  the  example  above,  210V290  reads,  ―wind  direction varying between 210 and 290.‖    KBLV 011657Z AUTO VRB03KT 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  VRB is used (without direction extremes) when the wind speed is  less  than  or  equal  to  6  knots.  In  the  example  above, VRB03KT reads, ―wind direction is variable at 3 knots.‖          8 METAR Visibility is  How do I determine the prevailing visibility?    KBLV 011657Z 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK SLP034  Visibility is measured in statute miles. In this example, 3/8SM (3/8  of  a  statute  mile)  is  the  prevailing  visibility.  Prevailing visibility the  greatest  horizontal  visibility  observed throughout  at  least  half  the  horizon  circle,  not  necessarily continuous.  Surface  visibility  is  measured  at  a  point  six  feet above ground level.  Sector  visibility  may  be  reported  in  the  remarks  section  if  it differs  from  the  prevailing  visibility  and  is  less  than  3  miles, or  otherwise  considered  operationally  significant.  For  sector visibility format, see VIS remarks in Figure 2 on page 18.    EDDF 071320Z 22008KT 9999 SCT036 SCT090 BKN280 19/10 Q1011 NOSIG  Most overseas locations report visibility in meters and omit the SM identifier. The largest reportable metric value is 9999. This value represents a visibility greater than 9000 meters (7 SM or more). The contraction CAVOK (ceiling and visibility OK) may be used when there is no significant weather, the visibility is 10 km or greater, and the ceilings are greater than 5,000 ft.   To convert visibility values from meters to statute miles see Attachment 3 or the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.     9 METAR Runway Visual Range, “R”  What if there is a group that begins with the letter “R?”    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034   Runway Visual Range (RVR) follows the visibility and begins with the letter ―R.‖ The runway heading will follow the ―R,‖ and in this example,  ―32L‖  represents  runway  32-Left  (C-Center,  R-Right).  The last four digits report the visibility in feet.    In this example, R32L/1000FT reads, ―runway visual range for runway 32 Left is 1,000 ft.‖    Most overseas locations report visibility in meters and omit the FT identifier  from  the  RVR  group.  The  same  RVR  at  an  overseas location  would  appear  as  R32L/0300  and  read,  ―runway  visual range for 32 Left is 300 meters.‖    How  would  I  decode  the  formats  M0600FT  or  P6000FT  or R06L2000V4000FT (not in example above)?    M0600FT P6000FT R06L2000V4000FT Reads, ―RVR is less than 600 feet.‖  (M = less than) Reads, ―RVR is greater than 6,000 feet.‖ (P = greater than) Reads, ―RVR for 6 Left is variable between 2,000 and 4,000 feet.‖   ―V‖ indicates that the RVR is variable between two thresholds.    For RVR conversion charts, see Attachment 4 or the front section of any Instrument Approach Procedures (IAP) booklet.  10 METAR Type of Weather  How do I determine if there is any weather?    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  If a weather element (precipitation or obstruction to visibility) is  observed,  it  will  be  found  in  the  data  group  following  the visibility.  The  absence  of  a  weather  element  group  indicates that no precipitation or obstruction to visibility is occurring at the time of the observation.  In this example, ―FG‖ represents ―Fog.‖    To  methodically  decode  a  weather  group,  look  for  six  key elements (depending on the phenomena, one or more may be omitted).  In  order,  these  elements  are:  Intensity  (symbol preceding  the  code),  Proximity,  Descriptor,  Precipitation Description,  Obscuration  (other  than  precipitation),  and Other.    For a complete table of weather group elements and examples, see Figure 1 on page 12, or reference Section C ―METAR and TAF Code‖ of the Flight Information Handbook.          11 METAR Weather/Obscuration Table  Figure 1.

KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  Each  observed  cloud  layer  is  encoded  in  a  cloud  group  with  sky coverage, altitude of the cloud base above ground level (AGL), and sometimes  cloud  type.  The  first  three  letters  of  each  cloud  group denote  sky  coverage  as  in  the  table  below.  In  this  example,  BKN indicates  broken  cloud  coverage.  To  interpret  the  reported  cloud base,  append  two  zeros  to  the  value  given.  In  this  example,  005 represents the value 500 feet AGL. Finally, in augmented or manual observations,  codes  for  convective  cloud  types  may  be  appended. CB stands for cumulonimbus; TCU stands for towering cumulus.    If  surface-based  obscurations  (e.g.,  clouds,  smoke,  haze)  are reported,  and  the  lowest  broken  or  overcast  cloud  base  cannot  be determined,  then  vertical  visibility  in  hundreds  of  feet  determines the  ceiling.  For  example,  VV002  represents  a  vertical  visibility  of 200 feet.   Sky coverage in eighths:   SKC or CLR FEW SCT BKN OVC Sky clear Few (Trace – 2/8) Scattered (3/8 – 4/8) * Broken (5/8 – 7/8) * Overcast (8/8) * The lowest layer reported as broken or overcast constitutes a ―ceiling‖   A  similar  table  can  be  found  in  Section  C,  ―METAR  and  TAF Code‖, of the Flight Information Handbook.    13 METAR Temperature/Dewpoint information  How do I determine the current temperature and dewpoint?    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  The group following the sky condition is the temperature and dewpoint in  degrees  Celsius.  To  convert temperatures from Celsius to  Fahrenheit see  Attachment 2 or the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.    In  this  example,  01  is  the  temperature  in  degrees  Celsius (1ºC), and M01 is the dewpoint in degrees Celsius (-1ºC). An ―M‖  in  the  temperature  or  dewpoint  field  means  ―minus‖ (below zero).                    14 METAR Altimeter Setting  How do I determine the current altimeter setting?    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  The  5-character  group  beginning  with  A,  following  the temperature/dewpoint  group  is  the  altimeter  setting  in  inches and hundredths of an inch of mercury (inches Hg), used in the United  States  and  at  US  airfields  overseas.  In  this  example, A2984  represents  a  current  altimeter  setting  of  29.84  inches Hg.    EDDF 071320Z 22008KT 9999 SCT036 SCT090 BKN280 19/10 Q1011 NOSIG  The  5-character  group  beginning  with  Q,  following  the temperature/dewpoint  group in hectopascals  (hPa),  used  at  most  overseas  locations.  A hectopascal  is  equivalent  to  a  millibar  (mb).  In  this  example, Q1011  represents  a  current  altimeter  setting  of  1011  hPa  or 1011 mb.    To convert altimeter settings from  mb  (or hPa) to inches Hg, see  Attachment  5  or  the  Flight  Information  Handbook conversion tables.        the  altimeter  setting is 15 METAR Remarks, US  What is RMK?    KBLV 011657Z AUTO 25015G30KT 210V290 3/8SM R32L/1000FT FG BKN005 01/M01 A2984 RMK A02 SLP034  In  METAR  reports  from  the  United  States  and  from  overseas  US military  airfields,  RMK  indicates  the  start  of  the  Remarks  section. Remarks  contain  any  pertinent  information  beyond  the  standard fields  provided  and  can  be  either  encoded  or  spelled  out  in  plain language.  For  a  partial  listing  of  possible  METAR  remarks,  see Figure  2  on  page  18.  Additional  abbreviations  are  constructed  in accordance with FAA Order 7340.1, Contractions.    In  this  example,  the  remark,  SLP034,  is  the  sea  level  pressure  in millibars (or hectopascals) to  the  nearest tenth.  To  decode,  place a ―10‖ or ―9‖ before the first digit (use a 9 if the 3-digit value is 500 or  more),  and  place  a  decimal  point  before  the  last  digit.  The  sea level pressure remark in the above example would read ―current sea level pressure of 1003.4 millibars.‖    Caution:    Do  not  confuse the METAR  remarks  ―5####‖  group or ―6####‖  group  with  the  TAF  ―5######‖  (turbulence)  group  or  the TAF  ―6######‖  (icing)  group.  Unlike  TAF  code  usage,  METAR ―5‖ and ―6‖ group codes indicate pressure tendency and cumulative precipitation  amounts--if  you  need  these  values,  contact  your weather provider for decoding instructions.  See pages 28 and 29 for more info on decoding TAF icing and turbulence forecasts.         16 METAR Remarks, Overseas information  follows information.‖  Supplemental  What is supplemental information?    Overseas (except at US military installations), METAR remarks are called ―supplemental the altimeter setting and uses remark codes like US remarks, as in Figure 2 on page 18, but is not preceded by RMK.    Supplemental information can also include:     - Recent weather elements, coded with a leading RE    - Sea surface temperature in ºC and sea state 0-9, coded W##/S#   - Runway state, coded as an 8-digit numerical group   - A 2-hour forecast trend as described below  EDDF 071320Z 22008KT 9999 SCT036 SCT090 BKN280 19/10 Q1011 NOSIG  Overseas  METAR  forecast  trend  groups  either  start  with  BECMG  or TEMPO, consistent  with TAF  coding conventions, or they consist entirely of  NOSIG,  which  indicates  that  no  significant  changes  in  reportable weather  elements  are  expected  during  the  2  hours  following  the  reported observation.    METARs  issued  by  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  observers have, as the last data group, a color code for ceiling and visibility data:    NATO Airfield Weather Color Code.  Color Code  Color  BLU WHT GRN YLO AMB RED blue white green yellow amber red BLACK black source:  AFMAN 15-111 USAFESUP1 * Ceiling at or above:  Visibility at or above: 2500 feet 1500 feet 700 feet 300 feet 200 feet < 200 feet Airfield not useable for reasons other than ceiling or visibility 8000 meters 5000 meters 3700 meters 1600 meters 0800 meters <  0800 meters  * Belgium, France, Netherlands, and United Kingdom use scattered clouds instead of ceiling   17 METAR Remarks Decode Table  Figure 2.

In the KBLV (Scott AFB) example, 051151Z shows that the TAF was prepared/disseminated on the  5th day of the month at 1151Z. The valid time of the forecast follows as  0512/0612 and indicates that the forecast valid time is from 1200Z on the 5th day of the month to 1200Z on the 6th day.    Although most TAFs are forecasted for a 24-hour period, the valid times  may  vary,  up  to  a  maximum  of  30  hours.  For  example,  the TAF at KPVU (Provo Municipal) is only valid  from  1200Z on the 8th  day  until  0600Z  on  the  9th  day,  while  the  TAF  at  KSLC  (Salt Lake  City  International)  is  valid  from  1200Z  on  the  8th  day  until 1800Z on the 9th day.    21 TAF Time and Type of Change Expected  How do I determine the time and type of changes that will occur?

TEMPO  represents  a  temporary  condition.  In  this  example,  TEMPO 0513/0516  1  1/2SM  BR  reads,  ―Temporary  condition  between 1300Z  and  1600Z  on  the  5th  day  of  1  1/2  statute  mile  visibility  in  mist.‖ Only the temporary changing conditions are included in TEMPO groups.    FM  means  ―from‖  and  indicates  a  rapid  weather  change  where  all  data groups  in  the  previous  line  are  superseded.  In  this  example,  FM051600 reads, ―From 1600Z on the 5th day…‖.    BECMG  means  ―becoming‖  or  a  ―gradual  change‖  in  meteorological conditions  and  becomes  the  predominant  group  by  the  end  time  listed.     In  this  example,  BECMG  0522/0524  reads  ―Becoming  from  2200Z  to 2400Z on the 5th day.‖    PROB40  (civilian  use  only)  represents  a  40%  probability  or  chance  of conditions  occurring  along  with  associated  weather  conditions  (wind, visibility, sky conditions).    In this example, PROB40 0600/0606 2SM TSRA 0VCOO8CB reads, ―40% chance between 0000Z and 0600Z on the 6th day of visibility 2 statute miles in moderate thunderstorms, 800 overcast cumulonimbus clouds.‖     22 TAF Wind  How do I determine the wind speed and direction?

The  first  three  digits  within  a  wind  group  are  the  true  direction  to the nearest 10 degrees from which the wind will blow. The next two digits are the sustained speed.  If  gusts are forecasted, the next two or three digits following the ―G‖ are the ―gust,‖ the maximum wind speed in a ten-minute window.    In this example, 14005KT, 16010KT, 21015G30KT, 29008KT, 31012G22KT,  and  30008KT  are  the  wind  direction  and  speed groups.    In  the  first  wind  group,  the  wind  is  forecasted  to  blow  from  140 degrees  (true)  at  a  sustained  speed  of  05  knots.  No  gust  is forecasted.    In  the  third  wind  group,  the  wind  is  forecasted  to  blow  from  210 degrees  (true)  at  a  sustained  speed  of  15  knots,  gusting  up  to  30 knots.      23 TAF  Visibility How do I determine the forecast visibility?

The 4-character group following the  wind is the forecast visibility. In the KBLV example, 8000, 3200, 1600, 3200, and 9999 are the forecast visibilities in meters. 9999 is the greatest value forecasted. A value of 9999 indicates a forecast visibility of greater than 9000 meters (7 statute miles or greater).  To  convert  visibility  values  from  meters  to  statute  miles,  see Attachment 3 or the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.    Overseas locations may use the contraction ―CAVOK‖ (ceiling and visibility OK) when there is no significant weather, the visibility is 10 km or greater, and the ceilings are greater than 5,000 ft.

In  this  example,  BR  means  ―mist,‖  -SHRA  means  ―light  rain showers,‖  TSRA  means  a  ―thunderstorm  with  moderate  rain,‖  and  -RA  means  ―light  rain.‖  NSW  (no  significant  weather)  is  used  to indicate that the weather or obscuration listed in the previous group is no longer expected to occur. Absence of a weather or obscuration group means that no weather or obscuration is expected during the forecast period.    To methodically decode a weather group, look for six key elements (depending  on  the  phenomena,  one  or  more  may  be  omitted).  In order,  these  elements  are:  Intensity  (symbol  preceding  the  code), Proximity,  Descriptor,  Precipitation  Description,  Obscuration (other than precipitation) and Other.    For a complete table of weather group elements and examples, see Figure  1  on  page  12,  or  reference  Section  C,  ―METAR  and  TAF Code‖, of the Flight Information Handbook.    25 TAF Clouds  How do I determine the layers of forecast clouds?

Add two zeros to the end of the  value  given.  In  this  example,  FEW030,  BKN008CB,  OVC020,  and SKC  represent  the  values  3,000  few,  800  broken  cumulonimbus,  2,000 overcast,  and  sky  clear.  Overseas  locations  may  use  the  contraction CAVOK  (ceiling  and  visibility  OK)  when  there  is  no  significant  weather, the visibility is 10 km or greater, and the ceilings are greater than 5,000 ft.     In place of cloud layers, vertical  visibility in  hundreds of feet  will appear in a TAF cloud group when the sky is forecast to be totally obscured. For example,  VV002  represents  a  vertical  visibility  of  200  feet.  Vertical visibility in a TAF represents the forecast ceiling.    When a surface-based partial obscuration is forecasted, it will be encoded as FEW000, SCT000, or BKN000 in the cloud layer area. A remark will appear after the altimeter that will describe the phenomena responsible. For example, FG SCT000 would indicate the weather element causing the obscuration is caused by fog and the layer amount is SCT. Surface-based partial obscurations will not be considered a ceiling.  Sky coverage (eighths):   SKC or CLR FEW SCT BKN OVC Sky clear Few (Trace – 2/8) Scattered (3/8 – 4/8) * Broken (5/8 – 7/8) * Overcast (8/8) * The lowest layer reported as broken or overcast constitutes a ―ceiling‖   A similar table can be found in Section C, ―METAR and TAF Code‖, of the Flight Information Handbook. 26 TAF Wind Shear  How do I determine if wind shear is in the forecast?

WS indicates forecast wind shear and is followed by a 3-digit height in hundreds of feet AGL, a slant character, ‖/,‖ and forecast wind at the height indicated. WS010/18040KT reads, ―forecast wind shear at 1,000 feet above the station; wind at 1,000 feet is from 180 degrees (true) at 40 knots.‖    The  remark  WSCONDS  is  used  to  indicate  the  potential  for  wind shear  when  there  is  not  enough  information  available  to  reliably predict the height, direction and speed of the wind shear. WSCONDS is normally used beyond the first 6 hours of the TAF.    For some locations, the wind shear group will follow the minimum altimeter  setting  group  (in  the  TAF  remarks)  instead  of  following the cloud group.              27 TAF Icing  How do I determine forecast icing conditions?

To decode, follow these instructions:   1. Find the icing designator ―6‖ following the cloud group (620304).   2. The next digit gives icing type and intensity (620304). See Figure 3.   3. The next three digits give the base of the icing layer in hundreds of feet (620304).   4.  The  last  digit  provides  the  icing  layer  depth  in  thousands  of  feet (620304), so add this value to the base height to determine the top limit of the icing conditions.    In  the  above  example,  the  icing  forecast  will  read,  ―light  rime  icing  (in cloud) from 3,000 to 7,000 feet.‖    Figure 3.

To decode, follow these instructions:   1.  Look  for  the  turbulence  designator  ―5‖  that  follows  the  cloud  or  icing group (520004).   2. The next digit will determine the intensity (520004).  See Figure 4.   3.  The  next  three  digits  will  determine  the  base  limit  of  the  turbulence layer in hundreds of feet AGL (520004).   4. The last digit will determine the turbulence layer depth in thousands of feet  (520004),  so  add  this  value  to  the  base  height  to  determine  the  top limit of the turbulence conditions.    In  the  above  example,  the  turbulence  forecast  will  read,  ―occasional moderate turbulence in clear air from the surface to 4,000 feet.‖    Figure 4.

These  are  near  the  end  of  the  line,  beginning  with  QNH (minimum)  and  ending  with  INS  (inches).  To  convert  altimeter settings from inches Hg to hectopascals (millibars), use Attachment 4 or the Flight Information Handbook conversion tables.    In  the  example  shown  above,  QNH2960INS,  QNH2959INS, QNH2958INS,  QNH2952INS,  and  QNH2950INS  are  read  as minimum altimeter settings of 29.60, 29.59, 29.58, 29.52, and 29.50 inches of mercury, respectively.                30 TAF  Temperatures  How do I determine the forecast temperatures?
