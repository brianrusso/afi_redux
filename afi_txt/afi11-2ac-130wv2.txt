The Aircrew Standardization and Evaluation Program is the commander’s tool to  validate  mission  readiness  and  the  effectiveness  of  unit  flying,  to  include  documentation  of individual aircrew member qualifications and capabilities. 1.2.  General.  This  instruction  establishes  requirements  and  grading  criteria  for  ground  and flight  phases  of  initial  and  periodic  flight  evaluations.    All  AC-130W  [flown  by  Special Operations Forces (SOF) aircrew] evaluations will be conducted IAW this instruction guidance and AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented.  Specific areas for evaluation are prescribed to ensure an accurate assessment of the proficiency and capabilities of aircrews.  Flight examiners use this AFI when conducting aircrew evaluations.  Instructors use this AFI when preparing aircrews for qualification.  (T-2) 1.3.  Applicability.  This  instruction  applies  to  all  individuals  performing  crew  duties  on AC130W aircraft or Weapon System Trainers (WST). 1.4.  Key words and definitions. 1.4.1.  “Will” and “Shall” indicate a mandatory requirement. 1.4.2.  “Should” accomplishment. is  used to indicate  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of 1.4.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.4.4.  “Note”  indicates  operations  procedures,  techniques,  etc.,  considered  essential  to emphasize. 1.4.5.  See Attachment 1, Glossary of References and Supporting Information for additional terms, definitions, and references. 1.5.  Waivers.  Waiver authority for the contents of this document is AF/A3O.  IAWAFI 11202, Vol 2 the MAJCOM/A3 is the waiver authority for individual aircrew requirements on a case-by-case  basis,  but  the  MAJCOM/A3  may  not  approve  blanket  or  group  (two  or  more  aircrew) waivers.    Waiver  requests  should  be  submitted  through  MAJCOM  Standardization  and Evaluation channels to the MAJCOM/A3.  As applicable, MAJCOM/A3 will forward requests to AF/A3O,  with  an  info  copy  to  AF/A3OI.    (T-1)    Post  all  waivers  to  this  instruction  in  the individual’s  flight  evaluation  folder  behind  Tab  2.  See  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2,  AFSOC  Sup  1,  for waiver documentation. 1.5.1.  Tier requirements refer to waiver authority based on level of risk IAW AFI 33-360: 1.5.1.1.  “Tier  0”    (T-0)    Requirement  is  external  to  the  Air  Force  and  consequence  of non-compliance  is  determined  by  respective  non-AF  authority.    Requests  for  waivers must be processed through command channels to publication OPR for consideration. 1.5.1.2.  “Tier  1”    (T-1)    Non-compliance  puts  Airmen,  commanders,  or  the  USAF strongly  at  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or unacceptable,  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waiver  authority  is  the  MAJCOM/CC  (Delegable   6  AFI11-2AC-130WV2  23 APRIL 2015 no lower than the MAJCOM Director) with concurrence of the publication’s Approving Official. 1.5.1.3.  “Tier 2”  (T-2)  Non-compliance may degrade mission or program effectiveness or  efficiency  and  has  potential  to  create  moderate  risk  of  mission  or  program  failure, death, injury, legal jeopardy or unacceptable, fraud, waste or abuse.  Waiver authority is the MAJCOM/CC (Delegable no lower than the MAJCOM Director). 1.5.1.4.  “Tier 3”  (T-3)  Non-compliance may limit mission or program effectiveness or efficiency  and  has  a  relatively  remote  potential  to  create  risk  of  mission  or  program failure,  death,  injury,  legal  jeopardy  or  unacceptable,  fraud,  waste  or  abuse.    Waiver authority is the Wing/CC (Delegable no lower than Group/CC or equivalent). 1.6.  Supplements.  Units are encouraged to supplement this instruction with standard evaluation profiles that best fit the unit’s mission, equipment, and location.  MAJCOMs will forward a copy of MAJCOM supplements to HQ USAF/A3OI, through HQ AFSOC/A3V, for approval.  Units below  MAJCOM  level  will  forward  one  copy  of  each  supplement  to  their  MAJCOM  OPR  for prepublication review.  (T-1) 1.7.  Evaluation  Procedures.  Before  the  crew  briefing,  the  evaluator  will  inform  the  aircraft commander  of  any  special  requirements.    Flight  examiners  will  brief  the  examinee  on  the conduct, purpose, and requirements of the evaluation, as well as all applicable evaluation criteria, prior  to  flight.    The  examinee  will  accomplish  all  required  mission  planning.    If  an  Operations Planning Team or Deployment Planning Team accomplishes mission planning, the examinee is ultimately  responsible  for  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  all  mission-planning  paperwork.  Flight  examiners will be furnished  a  copy of necessary  charts,  flight logs, mission folders, and any  additional  items  they  deem  necessary.    The  flight  examiner  should  not  occupy  a  primary crew  position  during  evaluations  to  ensure  the  most  comprehensive  evaluation.    If  conditions warrant; however, the flight examiner may occupy a primary crew position during an evaluation.  (T-2) 1.7.1.  Flight examiners will ensure all required training and documentation is complete prior to initial/requalification (RQ) evaluations.  (T-2) 1.7.2.  Unless  requested  by  examinee  and  approved  by  squadron  supervision,  the  examinee will be current for all events evaluated during a periodic evaluation.  (T-2) 1.7.3.  Flight  examiners  will  not  intentionally  fail  any  equipment  during  flight  evaluations, but may deny the use of systems not affecting safety of flight.  (T-2) 1.7.4.  Flight examiners will thoroughly debrief/critique all aspects of the flight.  During the critique,  the  flight  examiner  will  review  the  examinee's  overall  rating,  specific  deviations, area/subarea grades assigned, and any additional training required.  (T-2) 1.8.  Grading Instructions.  All evaluations will follow the guidelines in AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented,  and  this  volume.    Examiners  will  use  the  criteria  contained  in  this  volume  to accomplish all flight, simulator, and emergency procedures evaluations.  To ensure standard and objective evaluations, flight examiners will be thoroughly familiar with the prescribed evaluation criteria.  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV2  23 APRIL 2015   7  1.8.1.  Area/Subarea  Grades.    Areas/subareas  will  have  a  two-level  (Q/U)  or  three-level (Q/Q-/U) grading system.  Discrepancies will be documented against the listed subareas.  (T-2) 1.8.1.1.  Q.  Q indicates the examinee demonstrated both a satisfactory knowledge of all required information and performed aircrew duties within the prescribed tolerances.  (T-2) 1.8.1.2.  Q-.  Q- indicates the examinee is qualified to perform the assigned area/subarea tasks, but requires debriefing or additional training as determined by the flight examiner.  Deviations must not exceed the prescribed Q- tolerances, jeopardize flight safety, or be a breach of flight discipline.  (T-2) 1.8.1.3.  U.    U  indicates  that  performance  was  outside  allowable  parameters  thereby compromising  flight  safety,  that  deviations  from  prescribed  procedures/tolerances adversely  affected  mission  accomplishment,  and/or  evaluated  performance  constituted  a breach  of  flight  discipline.    An  examinee  receiving  an  area/subarea  grade  of  U  requires debriefing and/or additional training, as determined by the flight examiner.  (T-2) 1.8.2.  Critical  Areas.    Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  aircrew member  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  the  mission  objectives.    If  an  aircrew  member receives  an  unqualified  grade  in  any  critical  area,  the  overall  grade  for  the  evaluation  will also be unqualified.  Critical areas are identified by “Critical” in the area title.  (T-2) 1.9.  Evaluation  Requirements.  Evaluation  profiles  will  reflect  a  sampling  of  the  unit’s missions.  Evaluation tables are provided to summarize evaluation areas.  Areas common to all crew  members  are  contained  in  Table  2.1.    Instructor  evaluation  areas  are  in  Table  3.1.  Evaluation areas unique to each crew position are located in their respective chapter.  Each crew specific chapter defines required events.  Events required in-flight only, and/or in simulators (see Paragraph  1.9.1  below),  and/or  alternate  methods  (see  Paragraph  1.9.2  below)  will  be identified  in  the  crew  specific  tables.    For  any  areas  without  a  note,  flight  examiners  may evaluate at their discretion if observed.  If required events are not observed, then the evaluation is incomplete  and  will  be  accomplished  on  another  flight.    If  a  required  event  cannot  be accomplished,  the  evaluator  will  place  a  restriction  on  the  AF  Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew Qualification,  or  AF  Form  8A,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification  (Multiple  Aircraft),  as applicable.  (T-2) 1.9.1.  Simulator.  WSTs with a C or greater certification (or Training Value Code (TVC) of 3 or greater for all areas evaluated as determined by simulator certification (SIMCERT)) may be  used  to  accomplish  evaluations.    Simulator  certifications  will  be  located  at  the AFSOC/A3T website.  (T-2) 1.9.1.1.  If an area/subarea could not be evaluated in-flight, and the event is certified for evaluation purposes in the simulator, it can be evaluated in the simulator to complete the evaluation.    Document  in  the  comments  section  of  AF  Form  8/8A  which  portion(s)  of evaluation were conducted in the simulator.  (T-2) 1.9.2.  Alternate  Method.    When  it  is  impossible  to  evaluate  an  area  in-flight  due  to equipment  malfunctions,  operational  requirements,  scheduling  restrictions,  or  weather,  the area  may  be  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method  (procedural  trainer,  or  verbal  examination) unless  noted  in  the  crew  specific  chapter.    If,  in  the  flight  examiner’s  judgment,  an  item   8  AFI11-2AC-130WV2  23 APRIL 2015 cannot  be  adequately  evaluated  by  an  alternate  method,  complete  the  evaluation  on  an additional flight.  Document in the comments section of AF Form 8/8A which portions of the evaluation were conducted via alternate method.  (T-2) 1.9.3.  Grading  Criteria.    To  the  maximum  extent  possible,  flight  examiners  will  use  the grading criteria in this volume to determine individual area grades.  Exercise judgment when the wording of areas is subjective and when specific areas are not covered.  Flight examiner judgment will be the determining factor in arriving at the overall grade.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade.  (T-2) 1.9.3.1.  Base tolerances for in-flight parameters on conditions of smooth air and a stable aircraft.    In  some  cases,  momentary  deviations  are  allowable  provided  the  examinee applies prompt corrective action and such deviations do not jeopardize flying safety.  (T-2) 1.10.  Unsatisfactory  Performance.  If  the  flight  examiner  observes  an  aircrew  counterpart jeopardizing safe flight,  the examiner will assume the duties of that aircrew member  (provided the  examiner’s  flight  duty  period  does  not  exceed  AFI  11-202,  Vol  3,  General  Flight  Rules, maximum flight duty period for an unaugmented crew).  This does not mean the examiner must assume  the  examinee's  position  any  time  unsatisfactory  performance  is  observed.    If  the examiner feels the examinee can continue safely with supervision, the examiner is not required to assume the examinee's duties.  However, if the flight examiner assumes the examinee's duties, a Qualification Level 3 (Q-3) will be assigned as the overall grade.  (T-2) must report 1.10.1.  Evaluators established procedures/directives  in  any  area,  regardless  of  the  individual's  crew  specialty,  to squadron/group commander for evaluation and necessary action in accordance with AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented.  (T-2) deviations/discrepancies from 1.11.  Additional  Training.  Flight  examiners  are  responsible  for  assigning  additional  training, at  their  discretion.    Document  additional  training  and  completion  IAW  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2,  as supplemented.    Any  approved  training  device  or  medium  may  be  used  for  additional  training.  (T-2) 1.11.1.  Additional training may be accomplished on the same flight as the evaluation, when unique  situations  present  valuable  training  opportunities  (i.e.,  crosswind  landings),  and  the discrepancy  requiring  the  additional  training  will  not  result  in  overall  Q-3  evaluation.  However,  this  option  requires  flight  examiner  discretion  and  judicious  application.    The examinee must be informed when the additional training begins and ends.  (T-2) 1.12.  Rechecks.  Rechecks should normally be administered by a flight examiner other than the one who administered the original evaluation. 1.13.  Special Qualifications.  Special qualification evaluations are administered for events that are not universal to all members in that crew position.  Special qualification evaluations may be conducted  separately  or  in  conjunction  with  qualification/mission  (QUAL/MSN)  evaluations.  There  are  no  requisites  for  special  qualification  evaluations  unless  specified.    Refer  to  the appropriate crew position for any special qualification evaluation requirements. 1.13.1.  Special qualifications result in an AF Form 8/8A.  Special qualification evaluations are SPOT evaluations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented.  Further description of the AFI11-2AC-130WV2  23 APRIL 2015   9  specific event evaluated will be included in the mission description section of the comments block of the AF Form 8/8A.  Although a unit may maintain 100 percent of its crew members qualified, this documentation is still required due to interfly and permanent change of station issues.  (T-2) 1.14.  Multiple Qualifications.  Crew positions, evaluation requirements, and approval authority are IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented.   10  AFI11-2AC-130WV2  23 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  The  general  criteria contained in  this chapter  apply to  all crew positions and  all evaluations.    Use  criteria  and  table  in  the  appropriate  crew  position  chapters  for  evaluations.  (T2) 2.1.1.  All  evaluations  will  follow  guidelines  in  AFI  11-202,  Vol  2,  as  supplemented,  and Table 2.1  in  this  volume.    This  table  depicts  specific  grading  areas  that  apply  to  all  crew position evaluations; Table 3.1 applies to all instructor evaluations.  (T-2) 2.1.2.  Administer  aircrew  evaluations  on  any  flight  that  as  scheduled  will  accomplish  all required items for that evaluation.  Mission evaluations should be as realistic as possible with minimum of simulated events.  Do not deviate from peacetime restrictions.  (T-2) 2.2.  Requirements. 2.2.1.  Evaluate all crew members with guidance in the following subparagraphs, Table 2.1, and crew-specific chapters and tables.  For instructor evaluations, also see Table 3.1.  (T-2) 2.2.2.  Examinations.  All crew members will complete open and closed book examinations as a  requisite to  periodic evaluations.   Pilots  must complete separate open and  closed book examinations as requisites to periodic QUAL and MSN evaluations.  All other crew members will  complete  combined  periodic  QUAL/MSN  examinations. requisite examinations IAW AFI 11-202, Vol 2, as supplemented.  (T-2)   Conduct by the examiner or unit 2.2.3.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE).    An  EPE  is  a  requisite  for  all  flight evaluations.  EPEs may be conducted verbally, in-flight, in a simulator, or by another method determined   Operations  Group Standardization/Evaluations (OGVs) may develop EPE  guides for  each crew position flight examiner  use.    EPEs  should  be  scenario  driven,  and  tailored  to  the  specific  crew  position.  The EPE will include areas commensurate with the examinee's qualification and experience level.  Emphasize emergency procedures and systems knowledge.  Examiners should include other  general  knowledge  areas  as  well.    For  mission  evaluations,  evaluate  mission-specific equipment  and  situations.    EPEs  will  include  sufficient  inflight  and  ground  emergencies  to evaluate  the  examinee's  knowledge  of  systems  and  procedures  to  the  flight  examiner's satisfaction.  (T-2) Stan/Eval. 2.2.3.1.  Examinees  may  use  publications  that  are  normally  available  in-flight.    The examinee  must  recite  all  Boldface  items  from  memory  and  should  provide  the  initial steps of emergency procedures that, in the opinion of the examiner, would not allow time for reference.  (T-2) 2.2.3.2.  The following grading criteria will be used to grade individual items on EPEs for all crew positions.  The flight examiner will assign an overall EPE grade (#1,#2, or #3) in the Qualification Ground Phase block of the AF Form 8/8A, regardless whether all or a portion  of  the  EPE  was  performed  in-flight.    (Exception--for  Boldface,  use  grading criteria in Area 4).  (T-2) AFI11-2AC-130WV2  23 APRIL 2015   11  2.3.  Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  (CRM).  In  accordance  with  AFI  11-290, Cockpit/Crew  Resource  Management  Training  Program,  CRM  skills  will  be  evaluated  during initial  and  periodic  evaluations.    CRM  skills  are  integral  to  all  phases  of  flight;  therefore  no specific  area  titled  CRM  exists.    CRM  skills  are  imbedded  within  specific  grading  criteria (mission  planning,  airmanship/situational  awareness,  crew  coordination,  communication,  risk management/decision making, task management, and briefing/debriefing) and include all of the skills  listed  on  the  AF  Information  Management  Tool  (IMT)  Form  4031,  CRM  Skills  Criteria Training/Evaluation  Form.    Therefore,  use  of  the  AF  IMT  Form  4031  is  unnecessary  for evaluations. 2.4.  Formal  Course  Evaluations.  Fly  syllabus  evaluations  IAW  syllabus  mission  profile guidelines  if  stated,  or  on  a  mission  profile  developed  from  syllabus  training  objectives.    All required areas must be evaluated for the type of  evaluation  being  flown,  IAW  guidance in  this volume.    Grade  training  objectives  and  related  areas  using  the  performance  criteria  in  this volume.
