SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  Major changes include updating the OPR (from AF/DPXE to AF/A1PA) for the publication, revising the format to  detail  the  purpose,  policy,  responsibilities,  and  authorities,  adding  or  revising  terms,  and deleting outdated terms and canceled issuances as necessary.  Previous Attachment 1, Measuring Compliance, has been deleted.  Finally, office symbols and references are updated. 1.  Purpose.  The Air Force must recruit and retain high-quality people to operate, maintain, and sustain complex air and space forces to accomplish its missions.  Attracting and retaining these people  requires  a  compensation  system  that  appropriately  recognizes  the  unique  needs  of  the military  and  the  extraordinary  demands  imposed  upon  its  members  as  well  as  the  sacrifices demanded of them. 2.  Policy.  It is United States Air Force policy to maintain a compensation and benefits package for  Air  Force  members  that  is  equitable,  fiscally  responsible,  and  recognizes  the  unique conditions of military service.  At the same time, it should support force sustainment objectives in  both  peacetime  and  periods  of  national  emergency.    All  Air  Force  members  and  former members should receive the full benefit of compensation programs to which they are entitled or for which they are eligible. AFPD36-30  28 APRIL 2015   3  2.1.  An equitable compensation and benefits package should prevent a decline in members’ living  standards,  maintain  pay  comparability  with  the  private  sector,  and  maintain reimbursements at levels equal with expenses incurred incident to military service. 2.2.  The  compensation  system  for  Air  Force  members  must  be  predictable,  stable,  and transparent with respect to its adjustment systems. 2.3.  The Air Force will assist its members and former members in understanding and being fully apprised of entitlements programs and their eligibility for these programs. 2.4.  The  Air  Force  will  ensure  that  members  are  aware  of  the  various  compensation packages  available  to  them  and  that  each  member  has  information  to  assess  the  extent  and value of their personal pay, allowances, and benefits package. 2.5.  In support of these  entitlement programs,  the Air Force will validate service  credit for its  members  for  the  purpose  of  fair  and  lawful  administration  of  pay,  entitlements,  and benefits. 3.  This directive establishes the following responsibilities and authorities: 3.1.  The Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs (SAF/MR) serves  as  an  agent  of  the  Secretary  and  provides  guidance,  direction,  and  oversight  for  all matters pertaining to the formulation, review, and execution of plans, policies, programs, and budgets addressing military entitlements. 3.2.  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Manpower,  Personnel  and  Services  (AF/A1),  is  specifically responsible for developing personnel policies, guidance, programs, and legislative initiatives for military compensation and benefits. 3.3.  The  Chief  of  Air  Force  Reserve  (AF/RE)  collaborates  with  AF/A1  and  NGB/CF  to develop  personnel  policies,  guidance,  programs,  and  legislative  initiatives  for  military compensation  and  benefits.    Additionally,  AF/RE  ensures  compliance  with  AF  Policy  and informs Reserve personnel regarding entitlement programs. 3.4.  The  Director,    Air  National  Guard  (NGB/CF)  collaborates  with  AF/A1  and  AF/RE  to develop  personnel  policies,  guidance,  programs,  and  legislative  initiatives  for  military compensation and benefits.  Additionally, NGB/CF ensures compliance with AF Policy and informs Air National Guard personnel regarding entitlement programs.   4  AFPD36-30  28 APRIL 2015 4.  Terms Explained: 4.1.
