POLICY. AFPD51-8  19 APRIL 2011 1.1.  The Air Force relies on Air Reserve Component (ARC) judge advocates and paralegals to  meet  its  mission  requirements.    Therefore,  the  Air  Force  must  recruit  and  retain  high-quality  legal  and  paralegal  personnel  to  meet  peacetime  and  mobilization  readiness requirements  of  TJAGCR.    Further,  training  and  management  programs  must  ensure professional competence and adherence to standards. 1.2.  TJAGCR  is  comprised  of  all  the  paralegals  and  judge  advocates  serving  in  an  active status in the Air National Guard (ANG) and the United States Air Force Reserve (USAFR), whether  as  Unit  Reservists  or  as  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentees  (IMAs).    The  Air Force will recruit applicants who have superior qualifications in the field of law and extend to  them  an  equal  opportunity  for  assignment  to  the  ANG  and  USAFR  Unit  or  IMA  judge advocate  programs.    Only  individuals  who  are  currently  designated  as  judge  advocates  or approved as paralegals are eligible to hold IMA positions in the legal career field, or to hold judge  advocate  or  paralegal  positions  with  ANG  or  USAFR  units.    Applicants  for  judge advocate positions who meet the professional qualifications set forth in paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2,  and  who  otherwise  meet  Air  Force  qualification  standards,  may  be  approved  for assignment to TJAGCR. 1.2.1.  Applicants  must  be  graduates  of  a  law  school  accredited  by  the  American  Bar Association. 1.2.2.  Applicants must satisfy the licensing requirements of the highest court of a state or territory of the United States, or of the District of Columbia, such that they are authorized to engage in the immediate active practice of law. 1.3.  Members  of  TJAGCR  must  be  prepared,  upon  mobilization  and  when  otherwise required to support Air Force missions, to function as judge advocates or paralegals in a wide variety of positions with a minimum of additional training.  To meet this requirement, TJAG establishes training requirements.  TJAGCR judge advocates and paralegals who fail to meet the  training  requirements  established  by  TJAG  may  be  relieved  from  assignment  to TJAGCR. 2.  Responsibilities.  TJAG is authorized and required by statute (10 U.S.C. §§ 806 and 8037) to direct TJAGCR judge advocates in the performance of their duties, to designate officers as judge advocates, and to assign or attach TJAGCR judge advocates for duty.  TJAG selects officers and officer  candidates  for  duty  as  judge  advocates  in  TJAGCR  and  designates  them  as  judge advocates.  TJAG has the authority to  specify additional professional  qualification standards in addition  to  those  listed  in  paragraphs  1.2.1  and  1.2.2.    TJAG  assigns  and  attaches  TJAGCR members for duty, establishes training standards  and requirements, decides upon accession and removal  of  Air  Reserve  Component  judge  advocates  and  paralegals,  and  provides  professional oversight and supervision for all TJAGCR members.  TJAG has the authority to relieve a judge advocate  or  paralegal  from  assignment  to  TJAGCR,  either  for  cause  or  when,  in  TJAG’s judgment, such action is in the best interest of the Air Force. AFPD51-8  19 APRIL 2011   3  3.
