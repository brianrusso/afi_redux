Ensure review of training and evaluation records of newly assigned crewmembers andthose completing formal training to determine the training required for them to achieve BMC orCMR and to ensure compliance with provisions of this volume. 1.2.4.3.  Ensure RAP missions are oriented to developing basic combat skills or practicingemployment that simulates conditions anticipated in the unit mission. Provide guidance to ensurelogging of only effective RAP missions as RAP sorties. See Attachment 2 for RAP mission defi-nitions. 1.2.4.4.  Determine missions and events in which individual BMC crewmembers will maintainqualification versus familiarization. 1.2.4.5.  Determine utilization of BMC crewmembers. 1.2.4.6.  Determine how many and which BMC and CMR crewmembers will carry special capa-bilities or qualifications. 1.2.4.7.  Identify supervision levels required to accomplish required training, unless specificallydirected. 1.2.4.8.  Assist the wing and group in developing the unit training programs. 1.2.4.9.  Monitor currencies and requirements for individual assigned and attached crewmembers. 1.2.4.10.  Ensure crewmembers only participate in sorties, events, and tasks in which they haveadequate preparation, training, and currency. 1.2.5.  ACC squadrons will submit the following training reports: 1.2.5.1.  Four-Month Reports. ACC squadrons will submit a training report to HQ ACC/A3Yevery four months during the training cycle (due 31 May, 30 Sep, and 31 Jan) covering the periodsJan-Apr, May-Aug, and Sep-Dec. Squadrons may submit out-of-cycle reports at anytime if head-quarters assistance is required to prepare for Designed Operational Capability (DOC) or Air andSpace Expeditionary Force (AEF) tasking. The reports will consist of: 1.2.5.1.1.  An email memorandum summarizing results or unresolved issues since the lastreport, current training plan summary, and significant shortfalls and/or limiting factors (LIM-FACS) affecting training. Report only significant shortfalls and/or LIMFACS of events or sor-ties that affect 15% or greater of the squadron’s crew force. Include possible solutions orspecific assistance required if able. HQ ACC will attempt to rectify or minimize noted short-falls or LIMFACS while the training cycle is under way. Shortfalls occur when required mis-sion training tasks are not accomplished due to shortages of equipment, etc. Example:squadron’s ability to complete training requirements is limited due to a shortage of sensors.LIMFACS are factors, constraints, restrictions, etc. that degrade training effectiveness. LIM-FACS may include support hardware and software. Example: squadron’s ability to accomplishsensor training events is limited due to the lack of ranges. 1.2.5.1.2.  Filled out squadron training health slide (attachment to email memorandum) sum-marizing critical training issues. 1.2.5.1.3.  Complete both the email and the training health slide IAW the guidance and exam-ples at the web site https://totn.acc.af.mil/xoya/DOY_RAP/. As low-density, high-demand6AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007assets, RQ-4 units are not aligned with an AEF pair. The RQ-4 training cycle is aligned withthe AEF cycle. 1.2.5.2.  End-of-Cycle Reports. ACC squadrons will submit an end-of-cycle training report.Units will report all deviations from the training requirements in this volume or the RAP taskingmemorandum, after proration, to ACC/A3Y at the end of the AEF cycle. Include in the report anytraining requirements waived by the Operations Group Commander (OG/CC). Combine and sub-mit the end-of-cycle report with the cycle’s last four-month report. Email the end-of-cycle trainingreports to ACC/A3Y. For the end-of-cycle training report format, see Attachment 4, TrainingShortfall Report. 1.2.6.  Individual crewmembers will: 1.2.6.1.  Hand carry all available training records to assist the gaining unit in assessing qualifica-tions and training requirements. 1.2.6.2.  Be responsible for completion of training requirements and currencies within the guide-lines of this volume. 1.2.6.3.  Ensure they participate only in ground and flying activities for which they are qualified,current, and prepared. 1.3.  Training. Training programs are designed to progress individual crewmembers from Initial Qualifi-cation Training (IQT) or Re-qualification Training (RQT), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), andfinally to Continuation Training (CT). 1.3.1.  IQT and RQT provide the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify crewmembers ina basic position and flying duties without regard to the unit’s mission. Upon completion of IQT orRQT, the crewmember attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. BAQ is a prerequisite forMQT. Except for general officers above the wing level, BAQ is not a long-term qualification status.Waiver authority for any crewmember, other than general officers, to remain BAQ is MAJCOM/A3.Refer to Chapter 2 for formal training requirements. 1.3.2.  MQT provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify crewmembers in a spe-cific position and flying duties to perform the missions assigned to a specific unit. Crewmembersmaintain BAQ status until they complete MQT. Completion of MQT or a Formal Training Unit (FTU)instructor course is a prerequisite for BMC status. Completion of MQT is a prerequisite for CMR sta-tus. Refer to Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 for MQT requirements. 1.3.3.  There are two aspects of CT. The first consists of crewmember training in basic flying skills.These skills (Non-RAP requirements) ensure safe operation of the aircraft. The second consists ofspecific mission-related training required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions. RAP is the CTprogram designed to focus training toward needed skills. Specific RAP instructions are issued by eachMAJCOM via a RAP Tasking Memorandum. Refer to Chapter 4 for CT requirements. 1.3.4.  RAP is the CT program designed to focus training on capabilities needed to accomplish a unit’score-tasked missions. With completion of IQT or RQT and MQT, a crewmember is trained in all thebasic missions of a specific unit, unless a specific exception is provided in Chapter 3. Units thenassign the crewmember to either a CMR position or a BMC position. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200771.3.4.1.  CMR. The minimum training required for crewmembers to achieve and maintain qualifi-cation and proficiency in all of the primary core missions tasked to their assigned unit and weap-ons system. 1.3.4.2.  CMR Positions. All combat-coded unit API 1 and 2 positions, flying squadron com-mander (SQ/CC) and squadron operations officer (SQ/DO) positions are designated CMR posi-tions. OG/CCs may designate wing or group API 6 positions not assigned to the flying squadronas CMR. (EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line oftheir Unit Manning Document (UMD) crewmembers to CMR and designate the overage BMC. Inthis case, give priority to inexperienced crewmembers with at least 50%, if available, designatedCMR.) CMR crewmembers maintain proficiency and qualification in all core missions of theirassigned or attached flying unit. CMR crewmembers maintain currencies that affect CMR status,accomplish all core-designated flight training (sorties and events), and complete all missionground training. Failure to complete this training or maintain these currencies results in regressionto non-CMR (N-CMR) status unless waived by appropriate authority. While N-CMR, crewmem-bers may perform missions (including exercises and contingencies) in which they are current andqualified similar to BMC crewmembers at the discretion of the SQ/CC. 1.3.4.3.  BMC. The minimum training required for crewmembers to achieve and maintain famil-iarization in all primary missions (BMC crewmembers may maintain full qualification and profi-ciency in some missions) tasked to their assigned unit and weapons system. 1.3.4.4.  BMC Positions. All group or wing crewmember positions not designated by the OG/CCas CMR are designated BMC positions. Assign BMC designations to crewmembers whose pri-mary job performance is wing supervision or staff functions that directly support the flying opera-tion or are FTU instructors or operational test crews. However, these crewmembers provideadditional sortie generation capability, either in place of or in addition to, the personnel assignedto the flying squadrons. BMC crewmembers maintain familiarization with all unit core missions.They may also maintain proficiency and qualification in some of the unit core missions. For thosemissions in which they maintain familiarization only, BMC crewmembers must be able to attainproficiency and qualification in 30 days or less. BMC crewmembers accomplish all mis-sion-related ground training designated by their attached SQ/CC. BMC crewmembers may deployand participate in any mission for which they are proficient and qualified, without additional train-ing, as determined by the SQ/CC. Failure to complete BMC-required training results in regressionto non-BMC (N-BMC) status. While N-BMC, crewmembers may not perform RAP training sor-ties without supervision (per paragraph 1.4.4.) until a SQ/CC approved re-certification program iscomplete. 1.3.4.5.  N-CMR/N-BMC. Crewmembers who regress to N-CMR or N-BMC status will accom-plish a program to regain CMR or BMC status IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2. 1.3.4.6.  Specialized Training. Specialized training is training in any special skills that are notrequired by every crewmember, but are necessary to carry out the unit’s assigned missions. Spe-cialized training consists of upgrade training as well as CT to maintain proficiency and qualifica-tion in unit-tasked special capabilities and missions. Normally, units will accomplish specializedtraining after a crewmember achieves CMR or BMC status. Specialized training requirements areusually in addition to CMR or BMC requirements. Unless otherwise specified, crewmembers inCMR or BMC positions may hold special capabilities and/or qualifications as long as they accom-plish any additional training requirements. 8AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 20071.4.  Training Concepts and Policies:  1.4.1.  Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consis-tent with flight safety and resource availability. Training must balance the need for realism against theexpected threat, crewmember capabilities, and safety. This volume provides training guidelines andpolicies for use with operational procedures specified in applicable flying and operations publications. 1.4.2.  ACC Training Support Squadron (TRSS) will develop and validate training programs whenand where tasked by HQ ACC/A3. Other MAJCOMs may submit requests for training program sup-port to the HQ ACC/A3. Once validated, these requests will be prioritized and tasked to ACC TRSS.Designated test units may develop syllabi to upgrade operational test crewmembers in support of spe-cific test plans. The OG/CC approves these syllabi and submits them to ACC TRSS. 1.4.3.  Units will design training missions to achieve combat capability in squadron-tasked roles,maintain proficiency, and enhance mission accomplishment and safety. RAP training missions shouldemphasize either basic combat skills or scenarios that reflect procedures and operations based onemployment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use procedures andactions applicable to combat scenarios (e.g., appropriate use of code words, authentication proce-dures, combat tactics, safe recovery procedures, tactical deception, in-flight reports, threat reactions,intelligence briefing and debriefing). 1.4.4.  Unless specifically directed, the SQ/CC determines the level of supervision necessary toaccomplish the required training. Mission objectives that include introduction to tasks or instruction tocorrect previous discrepancies may require an instructor. 1.4.5.  Training will include use of aircrew training devices as much as possible. 1.5.  RAP Policy and Management:  1.5.1.  The crewmember training cycle is 20 months and is aligned with the AEF cycle. Units willcomplete training requirements during the appropriate training cycle unless specifically excepted. 1.5.2.  Each RAP qualification level (BMC or CMR) is defined by a total number of RAP sorties, bro-ken down into Non-RAP (basic-proficiency) sorties and RAP (mission-oriented) sorties. 1.5.3.  The total number of RAP sorties is the primary factor for maintaining an individual’s qualifica-tion level. The breakout of sortie and mission types is a guideline to follow as closely as possible, butminor variances are authorized. Variations in sortie and mission types may be a basis for regression asdetermined by the SQ/CC. The SQ/CC determines qualification in a mission after considering MAJ-COM guidance and the individual’s capabilities. 1.5.4.  An effective RAP training sortie requires accomplishing a mission profile. For training mis-sions, accomplishing a mission profile includes completion of at least one RAP event, as listed in theRAP Tasking Memorandum and defined in Attachment 2. Operational reconnaissance missionscount towards RAP sortie requirements. 1.5.5.  The SQ/CC’s first priority is to train all designated crewmembers to CMR. 1.5.6.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.5.6.1.  A one-month lookback at the higher sortie rate. 1.5.6.2.  Qualification in core missions and events required by CMR. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200791.5.6.3.  Confirmation that the progressed crewmember can complete the prorated number of sor-tie and event requirements remaining for CMR by the end of the training cycle. 1.5.6.4.  Completion of mission-related ground training, including a current verification. 1.5.6.5.  SQ/CC CMR certification. 1.5.7.  SQ/CCs determine and assign crewmembers that will train for and maintain special capabilitiesor qualifications. Normally, accomplish specialized training in addition to baseline CMR or BMC sor-tie and event requirements. 1.5.8.  CMR and BMC crewmembers will fly the required monthly sortie rate. If unable, refer to para-graph 4.7., Regression. 1.5.9.  End-of-cycle training requirements are based on the crewmember’s experience level on the lastday of the current training cycle. 1.5.10.  New units may fly crewmembers in CMR positions at the BMC rate until one month prior tothe operationally-ready date if the utilization rate will not support CMR sortie rates. Fly CMR crew-members at a CMR rate for the month prior to initial operational capability date. 1.6.  RAP Training Sortie Program Development:  1.6.1.  RAP sortie and event requirements (see Attachment 2 for definitions) apply to CMR and BMCpilot and sensor operator (SO) crewmembers as well as those individuals carrying special capabilitiesor qualifications and are IAW the RAP Tasking Memorandum. The standard sortie requirements inTable 1.1. establish the minimum number of RAP sorties per training cycle for inexperienced(INEXP) and experienced (EXP) BMC and CMR levels of training. The RAP Tasking Memorandumtakes precedence over this volume and may contain updated sortie or event requirements not yetincorporated in Attachment 2. Table 1.1.  Total RAP 20-Month Cycle Sortie Requirements. Minimum RAP Requirement Total RAP Sortie Requirement RAP Sortie Lookback (1-Month) RAP Sortie Lookback (3-Month) BMC (INEXP/EXP) Pilot 60/40 3/2 9/6 SO 80/60 4/3 12/9 CMR (INEXP/EXP) Pilot SO 120/80 160/120 6/4 18/12 8/6 24/18 1.6.2.  Non-RAP requirements are in addition to RAP requirements. These sorties and events ensuremaintenance of basic crewmember skills. Crewmembers may log non-RAP events on RAP sortiesprovided there is no affect on RAP sortie effectiveness. Unit flying hour programs contain sorties forcrewmembers to accomplish their minimum non-RAP requirements. 1.6.3.  Consider collateral or cost-of-business sortie requirements when developing unit flying hourprograms. These sorties do not directly relate to combat employment or basic skills training but arenecessary for accomplishment of day-to-day unit operations. Functional check flights and ferry flightsare in this category. RAP training does not require these sorties. For the annual training cycle, theMAJCOM allocates units a block of sorties, adjusted for local conditions and circumstances, for thesepurposes. 10AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 20071.6.4.  Unit flying hour programs contain a number of attrition sorties that compensate for non-effec-tive training sorties. Log a non-effective sortie when not accomplishing a major portion of valid train-ing for a planned RAP or non-RAP training mission due to poor weather, air aborts, etc. In order toallocate accurate numbers of attrition sorties to unit flying hour programs, it is essential that unitsappropriately log non-effective sorties. 1.7.  Training Records and Reports:  1.7.1.  Units will maintain crewmember records for individual training and evaluations IAW AFI11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 11-401, AviationManagement. 1.7.2.  Units will track the following information for all crewmembers (as applicable): 1.7.2.1.  Ground training. 1.7.2.2.  Requirements and cumulative accomplishment of individual sorties, RAP and Non-RAPsorties, sortie types, and events for the training cycle. 1.7.2.3.  RAP sortie requirements and accomplishments using one-month and three-month run-ning totals for look-back. 1.7.2.4.  Currencies. 1.7.3.  Units may fill in Aviation Resource Management System (ARMS) with either the date of thelast FTU equivalent accomplished, or the unit mission-certification date. 1.8.  Mission Recording. Crewmembers should use and assess all available training documentation onall missions. 1.9.  Crewmember Utilization Policy:  1.9.1.  Commanders will ensure wing-, group-, and squadron-assigned crewmembers (API 1s, 2s, and6s) fill authorized positions IAW unit manning documents. In addition, commanders will ensureproper designation of status for wing-, group-, and squadron-assigned crewmembers. The overallobjective is that crewmembers perform operationally related duties. Supervisors may assign crew-members to valid, short-term tasks (escort officer, Flying Evaluation Board, mishap board member,etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved, such as level of crew tasking, flying profi-ciency, currency, and experience. For inexperienced crewmembers in the first year of their initialoperational assignment, supervisors will limit non-flying duties to those related to operational activi-ties. 1.9.2.  Commanders must ensure that RQ-4 crewmembers assigned duties are commensurate withtheir level of assignment. Units may assign the following duties required by various publications toCAF squadron-level crewmembers (API 1s and 2s): tactics officer, programmer, flight safety officer,supervisor of flying, mobility and contingency plans officer, training officer (except ARMS documen-tation), SQ standardization and evaluation liaison officer, squadron life support officer, electroniccombat officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations. API 1 or 2 crewmembers will notbe attached to wing or group staffs or man wing or group staff positions unless total wing, group, andsquadron RQ-4 crew manning is 100 percent or better. In some instances, such as squadron-assignedflight safety officers, units may attach API 1 or 2 crewmembers to the wing. Commanders will assureAFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200711wing-and-above staff crewmembers (API 6s) perform duties justified in MAJCOM manpower stan-dards documents and fill positions authorized in UMDs. 1.9.3.  Crewmembers will not perform long-term duties that detract from their primary duties of train-ing for or performing the unit flying mission. 1.10.  Sortie Allocation Guidance:  1.10.1.  Inexperienced crewmembers should receive sortie allocation priority over experienced crew-members. Crewmember experience level definitions are in Attachment 1, Terms. Priorities for sortieallocation are as follows: 1.10.1.1.  Formal Training Units. Formal syllabus training, instructor upgrade training, instruc-tor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing instructor or flight examiner duties. 1.10.1.2.  Operational Units. Squadron-assigned CMR, squadron-assigned MQT, wing- orgroup-assigned CMR, wing- or group-assigned MQT, BMC, and BAQ. 1.10.1.3.  USAF Weapons School (USAFWS), and Test and Evaluation Squadron Units.Requirements directed by MAJCOM, training required to prepare for assigned projects and task-ing, BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions. 1.10.2.  Wing or group crewmember authorizations are IAW unit manning documents. 1.10.3.  For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following willmaintain formal instructor pilot (IP) status in the RQ-4: Wing Commander (WG/CC), Wing ViceCommander (WG/CV), OG/CC, Operations Group Deputy Commander. 1.10.4.  Above-wing-level (API-8) and test unit crewmember authorizations are IAW AFI 11-401 andMAJCOM guidance. Above-wing-level and test unit crewmembers will fly the BMC rate; however,do not require them to complete BMC-specific missions and events or meet monthly lookbackrequirements. They will accomplish non-RAP requirements within their BMC number of sorties.Crewmembers assigned or attached to ACC/IGS as API-6 will maintain RAP currencies and lookbackper API-8 guidance. Units should provide assigned crewmembers adequate resources to maintainminimum training requirements; however, the support will not come at the expense of the flyingsquadron’s primary mission. If units cannot meet attached crewmember requirements, they mustrequest relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented. Units requiring flying hour adjustments for attachedcrewmembers must request program changes IAW MAJCOM instructions. 1.10.5.  There is no maximum sortie requirement for CMR crewmembers. Table 1.2. defines the min-imum and maximum sortie requirements for other crewmembers. On occasion, unique and/or validoperations may require a crewmember to fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized;however, this may impact training of other crewmembers. 1.11.  Waiver Authority:  1.11.1.  Unless specifically noted otherwise in the appropriate section, waiver authority for require-ments of the RAP Tasking Memorandum and for all provisions in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of thisvolume is the OG/CC.

Senior officers must meet course entry prerequisites and will complete all syllabus require-ments unless waived IAW syllabus directives. 2.9.3.  Senior officers trained at the FTU at their assigned base are in formal training status and theywill turn over their unit duties to appropriate deputies or vice commanders until training completion.MAJCOM commander is the approval authority for exceptions to this policy. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200715Chapter 3  MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General. MQT is a training program that upgrades newly assigned crewmembers to BMC or CMRto accomplish the unit mission. RQ-4 MQT is primarily an FTU program conducted as a part of formalsyllabus IQT or RQT courses. Some operational unit training (unit-specific qualifications, initial chemicalwarfare (CW), and verification) is required to complete MQT. In unusual circumstances, MQT trainingnormally accomplished at the FTU may be accomplished with OG/CC approval at the operational recon-naissance squadron. Operational units will ensure MQT sorties and/or events not accomplished duringIQT or RQT are completed prior to declaring the individual BMC or CMR. Units may tailor their MQTprogram for all crewmembers, based on current qualification, experience, currency, documented perfor-mance, and formal training. 3.1.1.  Crewmembers will complete all operational unit MQT training requirements plus initial verifi-cation and initial CW training (ICWT) within 120 calendar days. The 120-day timing starts on thecrewmember’s first duty day at the gaining operational unit. If the crewmember elects to take leaveprior to entry into MQT, the timing begins after termination of the leave. SQ/CC certification isrequired for BMC or CMR status. SQ/CCs may certify individuals to BMC or CMR who have com-pleted MQT training through a mission flight evaluation prior to completion of initial verification andICWT. Failure to complete the initial verification and ICWT within the 120 calendar days will resultin regression to N-CMR or N-BMC until qualification is complete. Notify MAJCOM/A3 if trainingexceeds 120 calendar days. 3.1.2.  Crewmembers in MQT will not fly in Flag-level exercises. The OG/CC will determine MQTcrewmember participation in other exercises. 3.1.3.  Units will establish currency and frequency dates by the date the event or sortie was last accom-plished regardless of training status. 3.2.  Ground Training:  3.2.1.  Units will develop blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission as determinedby the SQ/CC. Units may credit training accomplished during IQT or RQT toward this requirement. 3.2.2.  CMR pilots transferring from another MAJCOM will complete theater-specific ground trainingbefore flying unsupervised. The ground training will include theater-specific portions of instrumentrefresher course. MQT academics may incorporate this training requirement. 3.2.3.  For initial verification, each crewmember (not required for BMC) will demonstrate a satisfac-tory knowledge of the squadron’s assigned mission to a formal board. The SQ/CC establishes theboard composition. Desired board composition is SQ/CC or SQ/DO (chair), tactics, intelligence, andplans representatives. Suggested briefing guide is at Attachment 3. 3.3.  Simulator Training. In the event MQT was incomplete at the FTU, units will ensure crewmemberscomplete appropriate mission qualification simulator training and evaluation to address the incompletesyllabus requirements prior to declaring individuals BMC or CMR. Accomplish simulator training in anapproved RQ-4 ATD. See paragraph 3.5. for CW simulator requirements. Squadron commanders are16AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007responsible for developing unit- and theater-specific MQT simulator training based on typical squadronmission requirements. 3.4.  Flying Training. In the event MQT was incomplete at the FTU, units will ensure crewmemberscomplete appropriate mission qualification flying training and evaluation to address the incomplete sylla-bus requirements prior to declaring individuals BMC or CMR. Squadron commanders are responsible fordeveloping unit- and theater-specific MQT flying training based on typical squadron mission profiles. 3.4.1.  MQT flying training requires a squadron supervisor or instructor unless specified otherwise. 3.4.2.  If more than 14 calendar days elapse between sorties, the SQ/CC may authorize an additionalreview sortie before continuing in the program. 3.4.3.  If not previously accomplished in the MQT portion of IQT or RQT, a mission evaluation willbe conducted IAW AFI 11-202V2, AFI 11-2RQ-4V2, and local standardization and evaluationinstructions. 3.5.  Chemical Warfare. Accomplish IAW MAJCOM guidance. The intent of CW training is to integratecrewmember training with other functional areas (maintenance, intelligence, security, etc.) required toconduct combat operations in a CW environment. CW training is applicable to all assigned or attachedCMR and BMC crewmembers deployable to chemical high-threat areas. 3.5.1.  Initial CW Training. ICWT provides initial crewmember qualification and proficiency in theoverall use of CW protective ensemble and familiarizes crewmembers with combat capabilities whilewearing CW equipment. Crewmembers who completed ICWT in previous RQ-4 tours are notrequired to accomplish or complete the ICWT simulator. 3.5.2.  Ground Training. All crewmembers will complete CW training IAW, AFPD 10-26,Counter-Nuclear, Biological, and Chemical Operational Preparedness, AFI 10-2501, Full SpectrumThreat Response (FSTR) Planning and Operations, and MAJCOM supplements. Accomplish the fol-lowing training prior to the first ATD with CW gear: 3.5.2.1.  Physiological effects and first aid of chemical agents and protective gear. 3.5.2.2.  Equipment orientation and fitting of full CW ensemble. The full CW ensemble for RQ-4crewmembers is the standard ground crew chemical protective suit, the MCU-2A/P chemical pro-tective mask fitted with a communications microphone, and the aircrew 7mil chemical protectivegloves. 3.5.3.  ICWT Simulator. Conduct a CW simulator mission in full CW ensemble. The mission willconsist of a reconnaissance mission profile, emergency procedures, and doffing of simulated contam-inated equipment IAW and including current shelter processing procedures. 3.5.4.  CW Certification. SQ/CCs will certify crewmembers as CW qualified upon the completion ofall initial ground and ATD training. 3.5.5.  CW CT Requirements. Units may credit the initial CW ATD mission toward current trainingcycle CW CT requirements. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200717Chapter 4  CONTINUATION TRAINING 4.1.  General. This chapter and the current RQ-4 RAP Tasking Memorandum outline ground and flyingtraining requirements for CMR, BMC, and BAQ crewmembers. Units must ensure crewmembers qualifyIAW AFI 11-202V1, AFI 11-202V2, and AFI 11-2RQ-4V2. Crewmembers must complete IQT to fly inBAQ status, MQT or FTU instructor upgrade to fly in BMC status, or MQT to fly in CMR status. 4.2.  Ground Training. Crewmembers will accomplish ground training IAW the Ground Training andCurrencies table in the current RAP Tasking Memorandum. Waiver authority for each event is IAW thespecified reference directive. Where discrepancies exist, the reference directive takes precedence. Unitsmay credit ground training accomplished during IQT and MQT toward CT requirements for the currenttraining cycle. Chapter 5 contains specialized programs with both flying and ground training require-ments. 4.2.1.  Mobility Training. These items are required for mobility units or units that generate in place.The following paragraphs and the Ground Training and Currencies table in the current RAP TaskingMemorandum delineate required frequencies, references, and affect on CMR or BMC status, mobility,or grounding for required mobility ground training: 4.2.1.1.  Chemical Warfare. Units will develop training plans and scenarios for CW trainingbased upon anticipated tasking in a wartime environment. Disaster preparedness and intelligencepersonnel will coordinate on and support the CW training program as necessary. Conduct CW CTprimarily through exercise scenarios complementing the unit’s wartime training from small- tolarger-scale exercises of sufficient duration to simulate chemical attack survival. Squadrons mayincorporate CW scenarios into other unit exercises; however, commanders must give careful con-sideration to temperatures and the increased demands placed on personnel operating in CW gear.Crewmembers will participate in the following annual CW ground training events: 4.2.1.1.1.  Donning the full CW ensemble. 4.2.1.1.2.  Doffing of the CW ensemble using current shelter processing procedures. 4.2.1.1.3.  Understanding the physiological effects of chemical agents and applying the appro-priate first aid IAW AFI 36-2238, Self-Aid and Buddy Care Training. 4.2.1.1.4.  Explosive ordnance recognition computer-based training is prerequisite. 4.2.1.2.  Intelligence. Closely align the intelligence training program with the unit tactics andelectronic combat (EC) training program. The OG/CC determines the focus and extent of aca-demic training. Align intelligence academic training with projected wartime tasking, threats, andunit equipage. In addition to threat knowledge, crewmember intelligence training will include: 4.2.1.2.1.  Current Intelligence. Current Intelligence is mandatory and will cover significantmilitary and political developments (including threat updates) in the squadron’s mission areasof interest. 4.2.1.2.2.  Intelligence Oversight Program. Units will conduct this annual training IAWDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5240.1-R, Procedures Governing the Activities of18AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007DOD Intelligence Components that Affect United States Persons; and AFI 14-104, Conduct ofIntelligence Activities, paragraph 7. 4.2.1.2.3.

Simulator Training. Accomplish training in an approved RQ-4 ATD. 4.2.5.1.  The Non-RAP 20-Month Cycle Requirements table in the current RAP Tasking Memo-randum depicts the minimum ATD training requirements. ATD sorties require instructor supervi-sion in order to satisfy annual requirements. Units may authorize crewmembers to conductunsupervised simulator sorties for individual proficiency provided there is no interference withscheduled training. Unsupervised simulator sorties do not satisfy annual requirements. Unitsshould determine additional CT training device supervision requirements based on expectedemployment tasking, training device capabilities, and mission training objectives. 4.2.5.2.  Units will develop scenarios that cover contingencies, fault codes, and pilot terminal areaprocedures. In addition, units will develop mission scenario requirements based on expectedemployment tasking and training device capabilities. Scenarios should place emphasis on trainingnot readily attainable during daily flying activities. Units will review scenarios annually andupdate as required. 4.2.5.3.  Crewmembers may receive credit for training accomplished in special devices such ashigher headquarters (HHQ) directed simulator test support, etc., if approved by the SQ/CC. 4.2.5.4.  Each crewmember will accomplish an ATD training sortie in full CW ensemble once eachtraining cycle. Within the mission profile, practice doffing simulated contaminated equipment.CW ATD missions complement existing ATD mission profiles. CW missions do not increase ATDrequirements. 4.2.5.5.  Accomplish EP missions in an ATD. 4.2.6.  Sensor Operator Imagery Interpretation Training. Sensor Operators who are Air ForceSpecialty Code 1N1X1s must maintain core competency knowledge, skills, and abilities as careerimagery interpreters.

Multiple Qualification and Currency:  4.5.1.  MAJCOM/A3 may authorize qualification in more than one mission design series (MDS) forcrewmembers only when command mission requirements direct such action and dual qualification iseconomically justifiable. MAJCOMs cannot delegate this authority. Unless required for unit missionaccomplishment, commanders must not permit crewmembers qualified in primary mission aircraft tomaintain qualification in support aircraft. 4.5.1.1.  Submit multiple qualification requests through command channels to MAJCOM/A3. Allrequests must contain full justification. Units will provide multiple qualification approval to theappropriate host base aviation management office. Do not authorize flight accomplishments untilaircraft assignment is updated in ARMS. 4.5.1.2.  Individually authorized multiple qualifications are valid as long as the individual remainsassigned to the specific position and aircraft unless rescinded by MAJCOM/A3. 4.5.2.  Multiple qualification is not appropriate for senior wing supervisors of units with differenttypes of aircraft. WG/CCs will qualify in only one of their wing’s aircraft. Either the WG/CV or OG/CC should qualify in another of the wing’s aircraft (not the one selected by the WG/CC). Wings willcomply with MAJCOM policy on senior supervisor familiarization flights. 4.5.3.  Crewmembers qualified in multiple aircraft will satisfy at least 50 percent of the sortie require-ments of their primary aircraft in that aircraft. If crewmembers are CMR, they will meet all RAP sortieand event requirements of the primary aircraft. In addition, crewmembers will fly an equitable distri-bution of training requirements in each MDS to fill their non-RAP requirements. 4.5.4.  Crewmembers qualified in multiple aircraft will fly at least once each 45 days in each aircraft.They will comply with all other currency requirements for each aircraft. 4.5.5.  Crewmembers must complete conversion training IAW an approved syllabus. 4.6.  Currencies, Re-currencies, and Re-qualification:  4.6.1.  Currency. Table 4.1. defines currency requirements for all RQ-4 crewmembers. If a crew-member loses a particular currency, the individual may not perform that sortie or event except for the24AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007purpose of regaining currency as noted. Instructors may log events for currency when performinginstructor duties. Table 4.1.  Crewmember Currencies.

Crewmembers must satisfy overdue training requirements before performing tasks appli-cable to the type of training in which delinquent. Training annotated as affecting CMR status willrequire regression to N-CMR until accomplishing appropriate training as specified by SQ/CC.Training identified as not affecting CMR status does not require regression from CMR, although itmay result in grounding until completing training. The duration of grounding and status of sortielookback will determine the effect on CMR status. 4.6.2.2.  Unless otherwise specified, the SQ/CC determines supervisory requirements pertainingto re-currency. 26AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 20074.6.3.  System Re-currency. Loss of both LRE takeoff and landing currency and MCE approach cur-rency requires the following action (timing starts from the last LRE taxi and takeoff, LRE landing, orMCE approach currency event): 4.6.3.1.  LRE – 31-90 (46-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain LRE takeoff and landing currency.Supervision level is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie. 4.6.3.2.  MCE – 46-90 (60-90 for Experienced) Days. Regain MCE approach currency. Supervi-sion level is an instructor qualified and current in the sortie. 4.6.3.3.  91-135 Days. Same as paragraph 4.6.3.1. and 4.6.3.2. above, plus instructor supervisedATD including: 4.6.3.3.1.  For CMR crewmembers: tactics, normal, and emergency procedures. 4.6.3.3.2.  For BMC crewmembers: normal and emergency procedures. 4.6.3.4.  136-180 Days. Same as paragraph 4.6.3.3. above, plus qualification and tactical writtenexaminations and emergency procedures evaluation (EPE). 4.6.3.5.  181 or More Days. Sorties, events, and ATDs as determined by the SQ/CC plus qualifi-cation and tactical written exams, EPE, and qualification and mission flight evaluation. 4.6.4.  LRE Takeoff and Landing Re-currency. Pilot is still current in the MCE. Loss of takeoff andlanding currency in the LRE only requires the following action: 4.6.4.1.  Regain LRE takeoff and landing currency. Supervision level is an instructor qualified andcurrent in the event. 4.6.4.2.  SQ/CC determines sortie and event training requirements to regain currency. 4.6.5.  MCE Approach Re-currency. Pilot is still current in the LRE. Loss of MCE approach cur-rency only requires the following action: 4.6.5.1.  Regain MCE approach currency. Supervision level is an instructor qualified and currentin the event. 4.6.5.2.  SQ/CC determines sortie and event training requirements to regain currency. 4.6.6.  Loss of and Re-qualification to Instructor Status. Decertify instructors if: 4.6.6.1.  They fail a flight evaluation. To regain instructor status, the instructor must successfullycomplete a flight evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2RQ-4V2. 4.6.6.2.  They fail a qualification, instrument, or tactical examination. To regain instructor status,the instructor must successfully accomplish the written exam. 4.6.6.3.  Their instructor currency expires. To regain status, see Table 4.1. 4.6.6.4.  They become non-current in an event or sortie that causes removal from CMR or BMCstatus and the SQ/CC deems that loss of currency is of sufficient importance to require de-certifi-cation. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor becomes non-current in events orsorties which do not require removal from CMR or BMC status, the individual may retain instruc-tor status, but the instructor will not instruct in that event or sortie until regaining the required cur-rency. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007274.7.  Regression:  4.7.1.  CMR or BMC Regression for Failure to Meet Lookback. If crewmembers do not meetRAP lookback requirements throughout the training cycle, SQ/CCs may regress them to N-CMR orN-BMC status, as applicable, remove them from a CMR manning position, or initiate action toremove them from active flying status. 4.7.1.1.  Failure to meet one-month RAP or contingency operations sortie lookback requires areview of the crewmember’s three-month sortie history. If the crewmember meets the three-monthlookback, the crewmember may, at SQ/CC discretion, remain CMR or BMC. Failure to meet thethree-month lookback will result in regression to N-CMR or N-BMC status as appropriate, or theSQ/CC may place the crewmember in probation status for one month. If the SQ/CC chooses pro-bation, the only way to remove a crewmember from probation and preserve the current status is toreestablish a one-month lookback at the end of the probation period. (See Figure 4.1.) 4.7.1.2.  CMR or BMC crewmembers regressed to N-CMR or N-BMC for lookback must com-plete a SQ/CC-approved re-certification program to return the crewmember to CMR or BMCstandards. Upon completion of the re-certification program, the CMR or BMC crewmember alsomust meet the subsequent one-month lookback requirement prior to reclaiming CMR or BMC sta-tus. Units may credit the sorties and events accomplished during the re-certification programtoward the individual’s total and type sortie and event requirements for the training cycle as wellas for the monthly sortie requirement. 4.7.1.3.  Lookback computations begin following SQ/CC designation of the crewmember to BMCor CMR. The crewmember must maintain one-month lookback until establishing a three-monthlookback. If a new CMR or BMC crewmember fails to meet one-month lookback while establish-ing three-month lookback, SQ/CCs may apply probation rules as described in paragraph 4.7.1.1.In addition, one-month lookback starts the first full month of CMR or BMC status. 4.7.2.  Unqualified Crewmember Evaluations. Handle crewmembers who fail a qualification,instrument, or mission evaluation IAW AFI 11-202V2. Crewmembers will regress to N-CMR orN-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR or N-BMC until successfully com-pleting required corrective action, a reevaluation, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. 4.7.3.  Failure to Maintain Flying Standards. If a qualified crewmember demonstrates lack of pro-ficiency or knowledge during CT (not related to a flight evaluation) the SQ/CC may elect to regressthe individual to N-CMR or N-BMC as applicable. These crewmembers will remain N-CMR orN-BMC until successfully completing corrective action as determined by the SQ/CC, an evaluation ifrequired, and are re-certified by the SQ/CC. 4.8.  End-of-Cycle Requirements. Crewmembers who fail to complete sortie and/or event requirementsof this volume by the end of the training cycle may require additional training depending on the type andmagnitude of the deficiency. Refer to paragraph 4.9. to determine if the unit may prorate some of theserequirements. In all cases report training shortfalls IAW paragraph 1.2.5. 4.8.1.  Crewmembers who fail to meet the total annual RAP sortie requirement may continue CT atCMR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if these crewmembers requireadditional training. 28AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 20074.8.2.  Crewmembers who fail to meet annual non-RAP sortie and/or event requirements may con-tinue CT at CMR or BMC as determined by lookback. The SQ/CC will determine if these crewmem-bers require additional training. 4.8.3.  Failure to meet RAP sortie-type requirements will result in the following: 4.8.3.1.  Regression to N-CMR or N-BMC if the SQ/CC determines that the sortie-type deficiencyis significant. To regain CMR or BMC, the crewmember will complete all deficient sortie types.Units may count these sorties against the total requirements for the new training cycle. 4.8.3.2.  Continuation at CMR or BMC if the crewmember maintains total RAP sorties and look-back and the SQ/CC deems the sortie type deficiencies insignificant. 4.8.4.  Failure to accomplish sorties required for special certification or qualification will result in lossof that certification or qualification. The SQ/CC will determine re-qualification requirements. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007Figure 4.1.  Regression Flow Chart. 2930AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 20074.9.  Proration of End-of-Cycle Requirements. At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC may prorateall training requirements when duties not to involve flying, emergency leaves, non-flying temporary duty(TDY) or exercises, and combat contingency deployments preclude training for a portion of the trainingperiod. Do not consider normal annual leave as non-availability. Units may consider extended badweather that precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days as non-availability. The fol-lowing guidelines apply: 4.9.1.  Only use proration to adjust for genuine circumstances of training non-availability, not to masktraining or planning deficiencies. 4.9.2.  Base proration on cumulative days of non-availability for flying during the training cycle. UseTable 4.2. to determine the prorated number of months based on cumulative calendar days ofnon-availability. Determine the prorated number of training events based on the prorated number ofmonths. Table 4.2.  Proration Allowance. Cumulative Days of Training Non-Availability Months Of Proration Allowed 0 – 15 16 – 45 46 – 75 76 – 105 106 – 135 136 – 165 166 – 195 196 – 225 226 – 255 256 – 285 286 – 315 316 – 345 346 – 375 376 – 405 406 – 435 436 – 465 466 – 495 496 – 525 526 – 555 556 – 585 Over 585 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007314.9.3.  If a crewmember is non-available for training and loses currency requiring a tailored re-quali-fication training program plus a flight evaluation IAW paragraph 4.6.3.4., then the crewmember’straining cycle starts over at a prorated share of the remaining months in the training cycle followingcompletion of the re-qualification training and flight evaluation. 4.9.4.  An example of proration for non-availability is that Captain Jones took 17 days of emergencyleave in January and then attended in-residence Squadron Officers School (SOS) from March throughApril for 56 consecutive calendar days. Capt Jones’ SQ/CC authorized a total of two months (17 daysemergency leave plus 56 days at SOS equals 73 cumulative days) of proration from his training. 4.9.5.  Round prorated numbers resulting in fractions of less than 0.5 to the next lower whole number,but prorate no requirement below one. 4.9.6.  Consider newly assigned or converted crewmembers and crewmembers who achieve CMR orBMC after the 15th of the month to be in CT on the first day of the following month for proration pur-poses. Units may prorate events and sorties for the remainder of the training cycle. Crewmembersmust complete a prorated share of RAP sorties in CT. 4.9.7.  SQ/CCs may prorate a crewmember’s last month on station prior to departing permanentchange of station (PCS) provided they do not exceed one month’s proration. Units may consider indi-viduals departing PCS CMR for reporting purposes for 60 days from date of last flight, or until loss ofCMR currency, port call date, or sign in at new duty station. 4.9.8.  Contingency operations may have a positive or negative impact on a unit’s CT program, asemphasis is on supporting the actual contingency. A potential lack of training opportunities whiledeployed may place a burden on the unit, forcing the unit to accomplish the majority of its CT pro-gram in a reduced period of time at home station. Units may log sorties flown during contingencyoperations as RAP sorties or contingency operations sorties. The following proration procedures pro-vide flexibility in accomplishing the unit’s CT program: 4.9.8.1.  RAP Sorties During Contingencies. Because the training quality of missions flown atcontingency locations may vary considerably, units may log sorties flown at contingency locationsthat provided valid training as RAP sorties. Events accomplished on these sorties count towardRAP event requirements, and units may not prorate these sorties and events upon return to homestation. 4.9.8.2.  Contingency Operations Sorties. If missions flown at a contingency location do notprovide valid RAP training, log the missions as Contingency Operations sorties and do not countthem toward annual RAP requirements. Units may use Contingency Operations sorties for look-back purposes. RAP events logged during Contingency Operations sorties do not count towardannual RAP requirements, but may update currencies. After returning from contingency opera-tions where Contingency Operations sorties are logged, units will prorate RAP sorties and eventsfor the period of time each individual was deployed. In addition, units may prorate for the deploy-ment preparation and deployment recovery time where MAJCOM reduces home station flying. 4.9.8.3.  Post-Contingency Proration. Upon return from contingency operations, compute prora-tion by calculating the total proratable sorties for the entire deployment, and then subtracting thenumber of valid RAP sorties. The result is the allowable sortie proration. Negative numbers equalzero. Prorate events at SQ/CC discretion based on the events accomplished during valid RAP sor-ties. 32AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 20074.10.  Regaining CMR or BMC Status:  4.10.1.  If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet the end-of-cycle eventrequirements, re-qualification is IAW paragraph 4.7. 4.10.2.  If a crewmember loses CMR or BMC status due to failure to meet lookback IAW paragraph4.7., the following applies (timing starts from the date the crewmember came off CMR or BMC sta-tus): 4.10.2.1.  Up to 90 Days. The crewmember must complete a SQ/CC directed re-certification pro-gram IAW paragraph 4.7.1.2. In addition, the crewmember must regain all RAP event currencies.The SQ/CC will approve any other additional training prior to re-certification to CMR or BMC. 4.10.2.2.  91-180 Days. Same as 4.10.2.1. above, plus qualification and tactical written examina-tions. 4.10.2.3.  181 Days and Beyond. Sorties, events, ATDs, and ground training as determined by theSQ/CC, plus qualification and tactical written exams, EPE, and qualification and mission flightevaluation. The individual’s training cycle will start over at a prorated share following completionof the flight evaluation. 4.11.  Lookback, Regression, Proration, & Re-qualification Process Example. Captain Smith is anexperienced CMR crewmember with a one- and three-month lookback requirement of four and twelveRAP sorties respectively. On February 3, Captain Smith flew an MCE Mission sortie prior to departingfor a non-flying TDY staff tour for two months. Captain Smith reported back for flight duty on 6 April.What is Captain Smith’s status throughout the TDY and on return to flying duty? 4.11.1.  The SQ/CC wanted to list Captain Smith as a countable CMR crewmember for reporting pur-poses throughout the TDY. Therefore, on 1 March, Captain Smith’s Flight Commander (FLT/CC) per-formed the mandatory one-month lookback (February). Captain Smith only flew three RAP sorties,failing the one-month lookback. The FLT/CC then performed a three-month lookback (Dec, Jan, andFeb). This three-month lookback showed that Captain Smith flew only ten sorties for the period. HadCaptain Smith flown two more sorties, the SQ/CC could continue him at CMR. However, with tensorties, Captain Smith did not meet the three-month lookback for a CMR crewmember. The SQ/CCcould regress Captain Smith to N-CMR, but instead elected to put him on probation, still carrying himas CMR. 4.11.2.  The SQ/CC carried Captain Smith on one month’s probation during March. On 1 April, Cap-tain Smith’s one-month lookback (March) was zero sorties. The SQ/CC must now regress CaptainSmith to N-CMR. When Captain Smith returns on 6 April, the SQ/CC must place him in a re-certifi-cation program. Upon completing this program, Captain Smith must then reestablish a one-monthlookback by 1 May. Failing to reestablish a one-month lookback by 1 May forces the unit to reportCaptain Smith N-CMR one more month until the next lookback process on 1 June. 4.11.3.  If Captain Smith had returned on 22 March while still being carried in probationary CMR sta-tus, he must fly four RAP sorties to recapture a one-month lookback and achieve removal from proba-tion. If Capt Smith was non-current for LRE takeoff and landing, he must fly a non-RAP LRE sortiewith an instructor to regain LRE takeoff and landing currency before flying MCE sorties to buildlookback. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007334.11.4.  At the end of the training cycle, the SQ/CC prorated two months of Captain Smith’s totalrequirements. In spite of this proration, Captain Smith was deficient in RAP sorties. The SQ/CC couldregress Captain Smith to N-CMR, if deemed significant. After he accomplished the tailored re-certifi-cation program (the deficient sorties), the SQ/CC re-certified Captain Smith to CMR. The sortiesflown for CMR re-certification count for the new training cycle. 34AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007Chapter 5  SPECIALIZED TRAINING 5.1.  General. This chapter outlines duties and responsibilities for units to upgrade, qualify, and maintainproficiency and currency for special capabilities and special qualifications. These capabilities and qualifi-cations are in addition to core missions for the unit and do not apply to every crewmember assigned orattached to the unit. 5.2.  Pre-Deployment Training. Conduct this training prior to deploying in support of contingency oper-ations (if time permits) or exercises. The objective of this training is to ensure crewmembers’ ability toconduct all missions in support of expected tasking. For contingency operations, units are responsible forcontacting appropriate gaining command to determine expected mission tasking. For exercises, units areresponsible for referring to appropriate exercise plans (EXPLAN) and contacting appropriate exercisepoints of contact prior to deployment to determine expected mission tasking. Refer to MAJCOM/A3 exer-cise and joint training division for the current list of exercises and EXPLANs. Prior coordination ensuresunit preparation for the appropriate tasking and allows the responding OG/CC to tailor spin-up trainingfor the theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task. The SQ/CC is responsible for implementingspin-up training, prosecuting the required missions, and determining the specific requirements necessaryto reach the desired level of proficiency. Units will place emphasis on training needed for missions notaccomplished in daily operations. Conduct spin-up training IAW all applicable instructions. 5.2.1.  Attached and Augmenting Crewmembers. Crewmembers not assigned to the deployingsquadron must receive spin-up training as determined by the deploying SQ/CC. This requirementapplies to all attached crewmembers (OG, WG, HQ staffs, etc.), and all crewmembers augmentingfrom other squadrons (operational or FTU). The objective of this spin-up training is to ensure attachedand augmenting crewmembers are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.The deploying SQ/CC determines the amount of spin-up training required for each attached and aug-menting crewmember based on the individual’s level of proficiency, currency, qualification, experi-ence, etc. For augmenting crewmembers, once the augmented SQ/CC determines the amount ofspin-up training, the augmentee’s SQ/CC is responsible for ensuring spin-up training accomplish-ment. 5.2.2.  Ground Training. All applicable crewmembers will complete academic training prior todeployment. Units will brief contingency or exercise SPINS, Rules of Engagement (combat) or Train-ing Rules, and command and control. Programs will emphasize deployment airfield capabilities, lim-itations, approach procedures, and hazards. In addition, cover area environment (weather) and uniqueoperating procedures. The local Weather Flight can assist with weather-unique training. MAJCOMintelligence organizations will assist the unit’s intelligence functions in the development of threatassessments, training materials, and expected collection tasking. 5.2.3.  Flying Training. Tailor spin-up training to ensure all deploying crewmembers are proficient,current, and qualified in all expected mission tasking. 5.2.4.  Responsibility. OG/CCs are responsible for ensuring all participating crewmembers are readyto deploy and are proficient to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking. 5.3.  Forms Prescribed. None. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007355.4.  Form Adopted. The following Air Force form is adopted for use in this instruction: AF IMT 847,Recommendation for Change of Publication. CARROL H.

WG/CV—Wing Vice Commander Terms Aircrew Training Device—A training device used to prepare aircrew members for the actualperformance of flight duties. The official categories for ATDs are Flight Simulators, Flight TrainingDevices, Aircraft System Trainers, and Other (for those that do not fall into the first three categories).ATDs are cockpit familiarization trainer, cockpit procedures trainer, operational flight trainer, part-tasktrainer, and weapon system trainer to name a few. Attrition Sortie—A sortie planned and launched as a RAP training sortie, Non-RAP sortie, or collateralsortie, that, due to some circumstance (weather, in-flight emergency, maintenance, etc.), fails toaccomplish the planned mission. It is imperative that units log these sorties properly. Improper accountingof these sorties will result in improper sortie allocation, stresses to the unit schedule, and negative impactsto the quality of unit training programs. Basic Aircraft Qualification—A status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed trainingprescribed to maintain the skills necessary to fly unit aircraft or operate mission systems. Thecrewmember must perform at the minimum frequency necessary to meet the most recent sortie and flightstandards set for the weapon system. The crewmember will carry BAQ only until completion of MQT.BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for general officers above the wing level, and any othercrewmembers specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3. BAQ crewmembers will not performRAP-tasked combat events or sorties without instructor crewmembers or SQ supervisor supervision. Basic Mission Capable—The status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training (MQT)prescribed for full qualification to perform the basic unit operational missions, but does not maintainCMR status. Crewmembers accomplish training required to remain familiarized in all, and may maintainqualification and proficiency in some, of the primary missions of their weapon system and unit. Thesecrewmembers may also maintain special capabilities. Contingency Operations Sortie—A mission flown at a contingency location which does not providevalid RAP training and does not count toward annual RAP requirements. Units may use ContingencyOperations sorties for lookback purposes. RAP events logged during Contingency Operations sorties donot count toward annual RAP requirements, but may update currencies. Combat Mission Ready—A status of a crewmember who has satisfactorily completed training (MQT)prescribed for full qualification to perform the basic unit operational missions, and maintains qualificationand proficiency in these missions. All squadron-assigned crewmembers, squadron commanders,operations officers, and OG/CC-designated wing- or group-level positions will maintain this qualificationlevel. EXCEPTION: If a unit is over-manned, they may elect to train the front line of their UMD to CMRwith the overage designated as BMC. Units must select inexperienced crewmembers for approximately50% of their CMR positions. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200741Continuation Training—Training to maintain proficiency and improve crewmember capabilities toperform unit missions and crewmember proficiency sorties not flown in formal syllabus missions, tests,or evaluations. Applicable to CMR and BMC crewmembers. Currency—The minimum frequency required to perform an event or sortie safely. Data Analysis Workstation (DAWS) Trainer—A part-task trainer that operates independently of theground station. DAWS trainers are used to train SOs on the fundamentals of target collection and providehands-on training with the mission collection software. Emergency Procedures Evaluation—An evaluation of crewmember knowledge and responsiveness tocritical and non-critical EPs conducted by an FE in an ATD, or the MCE. An EPE may be administeredorally if an appropriate training device is not available. Experienced Crewmember—Pilots:—An experienced pilot has: 500 hours PAI, or 1000 hours total pilot flying time (not includingSUPT or JUNT time) of which 150 are PAI. PAI does not include "other" time.

Mission Qualification Training—Training required to achieve a basic level of competence in unit’sprimary tasked missions. This training is a prerequisite for CMR or BMC status. Pilot Stand Alone Trainer—A pilot part-task trainer that operates independent of the ground station.Most elements of flying the airplane and emergency procedures training may be accomplished, but thesystem lacks the ability to conduct mission training. Primary Aircraft Inventory—Aircraft authorized for performance of the operational mission. The PAIforms the basis for allocation of operating resources including manpower, support equipment, andflying-hour funds. The operating command determines the PAI required to meet their assigned missions. Proficiency—Demonstrated ability to successfully accomplish tasked event safely and effectively. Forpurposes of this volume, proficiency also requires currency in the event, if applicable. Situational Emergency Procedures Training—A discussion and review of abnormal and emergencyprocedures and aircraft systems operations and limitations based on realistic scenarios. Specialized Training—Training in specialized tactics or flight responsibilities such as instructor, etc.Units may conduct this training in MQT or CT, as required. Squadron Operations Supervisor—The squadron Operations Supervisor must be filled by theoperations officer, assistant operations officers or senior flight commanders deemed qualified by thesquadron commander and approved by the OG/CC. Squadron commanders can always fill the OperationsSupervisor position, if available. See AFI 11-418. Tactical Deception—Any activity designed to mislead the enemy operational commander bymanipulating, distorting, or falsifying evidence, thereby inducing the enemy to act in a manner favorableto our interests or desires (see AFI 10-704, Military Deception Program). 42AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 2007Re-qualification Training—Training to re-qualify previously qualified crewmembers in basic aircraftflying duties without specific regard to the unit’s operational mission. This training is the minimumrequirement for Basic Aircraft Qualification status. Verification—Applies to procedure aimed at verifying and refreshing crewmember tactical employmentknowledge, emphasizing conventional operations and mobile targets. Conduct verification in both initialand follow-on phases. Initial verification phase is a formal board proceeding convened to verifyindividual crewmember knowledge. Continuation training is to reinforce, refresh, and updatecrewmembers on unit wartime mission, tasking, tactics, and procedures. Weapon System Trainer—A training device that dynamically simulates the flight characteristics of thedesignated aircraft to train crewmembers (pilots and SOs) in normal cockpit and flight procedures,emergency procedures, and combat mission execution. Trainer combines safety of flight operation,warfighting tasks, and provides skill integration training. AFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200743Attachment 2  GLOSSARY OF SORTIE, EVENT, AND CURRENCY DEFINITIONS A2.1.

The following is an example memorandum for reporting trainingshortfalls: NOTE: Detailed instructions on preparation of an official Air Force memorandum can befound in AFMAN 33-326, Preparing Official Communications. MEMORANDUM FOR ACC/A3YFROM: xx RS SUBJECT: xx RS Training Shortfall Report Date 1. Summary of Previous Report Results and Issues. (Use paragraph one to provide a brief sum-mary of unresolved issues from previous report.) 2. Past 4 Months (Status and Issues). Each squadron shall provide a PowerPoint slide encompass-ing the four months since the last report. Slide template is available from https://totn.acc.af.mil/xoya/DOY_RAP/. Use paragraph two to expand on Critical Issues, LIMFACS and Shortfalls,AEF Training Issues, or Get Well Plan areas of the required slide, or to report any items of specialinterest not covered by the slide template. If current slide information does not require more detailin  paragraph  two,  simply  state  “All  data  reported  on  required  slide.  No  expanded  details  toreport.” Critical issues may include, but are not limited to, any of the following conditions: a. MQT is averaging more than 120 days (per person) to complete. b. Upgrades are less than 50% of desired number to maintain a productive training environmentcommensurate to train to RAP standards. c. Experience level drops below 40%. d. Squadron Commander considers RAP training health in poor condition. e. Average sortie count falls to more than two below requirement for lookback month. f. Current or projected taskings (real world tasking, exercises, etc.) pose a significant negativeimpact on squadron’s ability to train to RAP standards. g. Training effectiveness of AEF or contingency mission sorties is considered poor. h. Aircraft modification programs or upgrades pose a significant negative impact on squadron’sability to train to RAP standards. i. LIMFACS, shortfalls or other training problems can be considered a trend or condition which,if unchecked, has the potential to become a critical condition. For example, if the squadron isunable to accomplish sensor CT events due to a shortage of sensors, a shortfall exists that ifunresolved could deteriorate to a critical condition affecting MQT, upgrades, or RAP traininghealth. 3. Commander’s Comments: This is an open forum for specific concerns regarding the squadron’straining health. Examples include non-critical resource issues or those the commander feels couldAFI11-2RQ-4V1   3 FEBRUARY 200749affect RAP training. Provide a projection of the squadron’s ability to accomplish 20 month RAPrequirements. Comments to improve the training reporting system are also voiced here.
