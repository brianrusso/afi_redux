This publication explains doctrine and procedures to guide commanders and Fire  Emergency  Services  (FES  personnel  at  all  levels  in  protecting  mission  resources  during contingencies.  These  contingencies  may  include  but  are  not  limited  too;  major  combat operations, humanitarian relief operations, responses to manmade or natural disasters, etc. These operations may occur at bare bases, forward operating bases (FOB), co-located bases, or aerial ports. 1.2. Mission.  The  Air  Force  FES  mission  is  to  provide  fire  prevention  services  and  minimize negative  consequences of  emergency  incidents.  The  scope  of  services  includes  releases  of hazardous materials (including chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN)) resulting from accident, natural causes, or intentional use as a weapon of mass destruction (WMD); fires that  endanger  people,  property,  or  the  environment  regardless  of  property  involved  (wildland, equipment, buildings, aircraft, etc.); fires in nearby federal agency facilities in the event normal FES  are  inhibited;  persons  trapped  or  otherwise  unable  to  escape  a  dangerous  situation; Prehospital  medical  emergencies  (non-transport);  or  intervention  at  other  emergency  situations such as natural or manmade disasters that threaten life, property, or the environment. 1.3.  Contingency  Firefighting.  During  contingency  operations,  firefighting  forces  are  the primary installation  emergency  response  team  and  are  responsible  for  supporting  the commander’s primary requirement to launch and recover sorties. To meet this requirement, FES operations may differ from normal peacetime operations. The information contained herein will assist  commanders  and  firefighters  in  understanding  the  risks  and  calculated  assessments required to sustain the contingency FES mission. Typical contingency manpower and resources are based on the War Mobilization Plan, Volume 1 (WMP-1), CE Supplement, Appendix 5 (for wartime planning), or AFPAM 32-2004, Aircraft Fire Protection for Exercise and Contingency Operations),  (short  duration  operations  generally  less  than  120  days).  Note:  The  primary contingency  FES  mission  is  to  support  sortie  generation;  protecting  critical,  high  priority components  supporting  the  flying  mission  is  secondary  and  is  articulated  as  Emergency Response  Capability  (ERC). ERC  is  the  level  of  service  that  can  be  provided  with  available personnel, equipment, vehicles, and fire extinguishing agents.  The ERC can be affected by the lack  of  trained  personnel,  reduced  fire  fighting  agent,  equipment  out-of-service,  and  the capability to  meet  established  response  times.  Decision-makers  at  all  levels  must  be  informed when the ERC is below standard requirements. Since home station FES resources are shared to support contingency operations, risk management must be employed more aggressively due to the reduced FES resources at both home stations and contingency locations.  Additional risk is expected at both locations. 1.4.  LIMFACS.  Firefighters  may  have  limited  capabilities  or  resources  during  contingency operations (especially during initial stages of a deployment).  The amount of resources common to  peacetime  operations,  such  as  manpower,  vehicles,  agents  and  equipment,  may  not  be available. 8           AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 1.4.1.  UTCs  do  not  exist  separately  for  training,  logistics,  or  Emergency  Communication Center  (ECC).  These  functions  may  be  performed  by  shift  personnel  as  additional  duties during  contingencies.  Additionally,  unique  contingency  tasks  such  as  security,  shelter management and Contamination Control Area (CCA) could be tasked to FES personnel once follow-on forces arrive. Fire chiefs must prioritize the services to be provided and conduct a risk assessment so sortie support is not compromised during the initial stages of a deployment. 1.4.2.  Firefighter  performance  is  greatly  reduced when operating  in  the  Joint Firefighter Integrated  Response  Ensemble  (JFIRE)  due  to  the  ensemble  placing  additional  physical burdens  on  the  firefighter. Physical  challenges  related  to  JFIRE  include  increased  weight, thermal burden, increased difficulty breathing through the C-2 canister, the need for increased work-rest  cycles  (WRC)  and  rehabilitation  difficulties  after  an  emergency  response. These LIMFACS  must  be  considered  during emergency operations.  Expectations  from  firefighters must be reduced and the focus shifted to protecting only the highest priority resources. 1.4.3. Lack  of  adequate water supply will  limit  FES  capability;  therefore fire chiefs  should pre-plan responses taking that potential LIMFACS into consideration. 1.4.4.  Fire  vehicles  carry  required  fire  fighting  agents  and  firefighters  to  the  scene  of  an incident. Reduction of vehicles or out-of-service vehicles diminish response capability. 1.4.5.  FES  resources  will  be  vulnerable  to  attack  until  splinter  protection,  hardening  and contamination  avoidance  measures  are  in  place.  This  includes  resources  such  as  fire facilities,  vehicles,  communications  equipment,  personnel,  rescue  equipment,  extinguishing agents  and  personal  protective equipment  (PPE). 1.4.6. Limited  supplies  of  extinguishing  agents  (Aqueous  Film  Forming  Foam (AFFF),  dry chemical,  and  water)  will  hinder  or  prevent  operations  to  extinguish  large  fully  involved fires which include POL, munitions, aircraft, and large square footage facilities. 1.4.7.  Enemy  attack  may include CBRN,  Improvised  Explosive  Devices  (IEDs),  Vehicle Born  Improvised  Explosive  Devices  (VBIEDs)  or  ground  attack  by  enemy  forces. Consequently,  unexploded explosive  ordnance (UXO)  can  delay fire  response. The Senior Fire Officer (SFO) must ensure UXOs blocking access to mission essential  assets are cleared by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel as soon as  possible. In  this  environment, firefighters  must  perform  explosive  ordnance  reconnaissance  (EOR)  in  their  surrounding areas  as  well  as  response  routes  that  could  possibly  cause  delays  in  emergency  response. These delays may allow fires to progress prior to FES arrival, increasing the need for larger amounts of firefighting agents. If appropriate, the SFO  may allow some fires to burn to save resources for higher priorities or to avoid  unreasonable risk to firefighters. 1.4.8.  The  absence  of  armored  firefighting  vehicles  limits  responses    to    areas   inside  the fence  in  hostile  environments  where  attacks  “outside  the  wire”  are  expected.  Responses outside  the  wire  will  only  occur  with  approval  of  the Installation  Commander  and  follow guidelines  established  for  such  responses.  Procedures  for  outside  the  wire  operations  must be prepared and approved at the beginning of operations.           AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 9 Chapter 2 RESPONSIBILITIES AND SUPPORT 2.1  Installation  Commander.  Installation  commanders  are  responsible  for  establishing comprehensive  installation  FES  programs.  These  programs  execute  Department  of  Defense Instructions  (DODI)  6055.06,  DoD  Fire  and  Emergency  Services  (FES)  Program,  DODI 6055.6-M,  DoD  Fire  and  Emergency  Services  Certification  Program,  AFPD  32-20,  Fire Emergency Services, and  AFI 32-2001, Fire Emergency Services Program. 2.1.1.  Core  Services.  Core  services  include  fire  prevention  and  minimizing  adverse consequences at most probable incidents (i.e. pre-hospital medical emergencies; a structural fire contained in the room or area of origin; an aircraft fire at one location, one side, interior or  exterior;  rescue;  a  HazMat  release  manageable  with  defensive  operations,  entrapment resulting  from  automobile  or  equipment  accidents,  and  urban  interface  at  wildland  fires). The FES Flights’ resource authorizations are based on the most demanding core services and the  assumption  that  only  one  major  emergency  incident  will  occur  at  a  time. In  the  event that  multiple  incidents  occur,  response  priorities  are  pre-determined    in    installation emergency management plans. 2.1.2.  Non-Core  Services.  Installation  Commanders  may  approve  non-core  services  not included in paragraph 2.1.1 utilizing existing resources.  Specifically, wildland fire fighting, technical  rescue,  offensive  HazMat  operations  and  other  emergency  operations  to  manage uncommon  local  risks  maybe  assigned  to  the  flight.  However,  due  diligence  must  be incorporated  in  the  decision  process  resulting  in  an  RM  plan  prepared by  the  IFC  that addresses  the  risk  to  core  missions.  When  the  risk  is  not  acceptable,  commanders  may provide  unit-funded  additional  resources  to  enable  the  flight  to  accomplish  the  non-core services.  The  Installation  Commander  will  advise  the  Command  Civil  Engineer  of  all approved non-core services not included in paragraph 2.1.1.  The Command Civil Engineer will  determine,  based  on  the  significance  of  the  non-core  services  approved  whether  other MAJCOM leaders need to be advised. 2.2. Transportation. The SFO will submit requests to: 2.2.1. Provide vehicle mechanics. 2.2.2. Accomplish fire vehicle repairs in fire station or dispersal locations. 2.2.3. Provide  replacement  fire  vehicles  and  parts  as  required.  Replacement  parts  receive the  highest  force  activity  designator  (FAD)  assigned  to  the  mission  being  supported  if  the part renders a fire vehicle out of service or in a  limited service status. 2.3. Supply, Contracting and Finance Functions. All supplies and firefighting equipment may be  provided  through  local  vendor  services  and  contracts.  Firefighting  equipment  must    be National  Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA)  compliant.  All  requisitions  for  critical  FES equipment  must  be  equal  to  the  highest FAD assigned to the mission being supported. Submit requests to: 2.3.1. Provide firefighter PPE and other supplies.                      10 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 2.3.2.  Provide  JFIRE  component  replacements  in  sufficient  quantities  to  accommodate existing or inbound firefighters. 2.3.3. Provide firefighting agents as required. 2.4. Services. The SFO submits requests to: 2.4.1.  Provide  billeting  for  firefighters.  Firefighters  may  be  dispersed    to    minimize    the impact  of  enemy  attacks.  Response  capability  impacts  must  be  considered when making this determination. 2.4.2. Provide food services to firefighters. 2.4.3. Assist in posting fire reporting, prevention and safety information in life  support areas (LSAs) and work areas. 2.5. Personnel  Support  for  Contingency  Operations  (PERSCO).  The SFO submits  requests to: 2.5.1. Make emergency manpower requests through the AOR FES functional  manager. 2.5.2.  Brief  fire  prevention,  emergency  reporting  and  other  safety  procedures   during  in processing. 2.6.  Communications.  The  SFO  submits  requests  to  the  communications  function  to  obtain install and maintain the ECC communications network which includes portable radios and mobile head units for vehicles. 2.7.  Security  Forces.  The  SFO  submits  requests  to  SF  to  provide  physical  and  emergency services as necessary.  However, firefighters may be required to carry weapons thus providing self- security. 2.8. Civil Engineers. The SFO submits requests to CE to: 2.8.1. Provide EOD services on a priority basis when UXOs hinder FES response 2.8.2. Provide power production and barrier maintenance expertise for generator support and barrier reset operations. 2.8.3. Assist with large-scale decontamination of FES assets. 2.8.4. Provide required emergency management support elements. 2.8.5.  Provide  a  high  priority  for  splinter  protection  and  hardening,  and  contamination avoidance measures of FES assets. 2.8.6. Provide, maintain and improve firefighting water supplies. 2.9. Fuels. The SFO submits requests to the fuels function to:                AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 11 2.9.1. Service FES vehicles and equipment. 2.9.2. Provide POL storage area familiarization training to firefighters. 2.9.3. Assist in fuel transfer operations and provide expertise in the event of a POL storage area incident. 2.10. Unit Control Centers (UCC). UCCs ensure that: 2.10.1.  All  personnel  are  trained  in  fire  prevention,  reporting,  and  safety  procedures  and responsibilities (see Attachments 4 and 7). 2.10.2. All HAZMAT storage facilities are limited to only those necessary to accomplish the mission. 2.11.  Contingency  Response  Group  Element.  The   SFO   submits   requests   to   the   CRGE (formerly  known  as  Tanker  Airlift  Control  Element  [TALCE]) to: 2.11.1. Provide information/support on air flow movement. 2.11.2. Provide information on aircraft parking. 2.12. Base Operations (Airfield Management). The SFO submits requests  to: 2.12.1. Obtain flightline licensing. 2.12.2. Obtain airfield layout maps. 2.12.3. Obtain daily flying schedule. 12     AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 3 PLANNING GUIDANCE 3.1.  Introductions.  The  focus  of  fire  resources  in  wartime  or  during  contingencies  is  fire prevention  and  fire  fighting. Fire  prevention  focuses  on  preparing  occupants  and  operators  to operate  safely  to  prevent fires and detect  and  intervene  early  at  fires  that  occur.  The  fire fighting  element  protects  weapons  systems  and  facilities  needed to  accomplish  the  mission.  A critical first step is  to develop a list of priorities at the site. This is a corporative effort with the Emergency Management  element.  At  some  locations,  aircraft  may  be  the   highest  priority for  protection  while  at  others,  facilities  may  be  more  critical  than  aircraft.  Wartime  staffing assumes  operating  from  a  central  fire  station  where  all  resources  are  based. It  also  assumes that  only  one  major  emergency  event  will  occur  at  a  time. Risk  assessment  and  management procedures,  response  time  standards  and  operational  procedures  are  similar  to  home  station operations.  FES  response  strategies  may  be  complicated  by  the  presence  of  chemical  agents, antipersonnel  devices,  and  munitions.  FES  capability  must  be  included  in  appropriate  base recovery plans. 3.2. Force Packages. Firefighters are postured into force packages identified by unit type codes (UTC). 3.2.1. The  6-person  Fire  Operations  team  (4FPFP)  is  the  basic  building  block. It  provides the manpower to manage emergency operations, including staffing fire trucks and emergency communications centers. 3.2.2. The  2-person  Incident  Command  team  (4FPFJ)  provides  mid-level  supervision  and incident command for firefighting operations. 3.2.3.  Fire  Management  teams  (4FPFN/4FPFF)  serve  as  the  fire  chief/  flight  chief  and provides  overall  FES  flight  management.  The  teams  establish  and maintain FES capability and serve as the principle fire risk manager and advisor to senior leaders minimizing loss of life and property. 3.2.4. The  2-person  Fire  Inspection  Prevention  team  (4FPFG)  provides  fire inspection and prevention capability. 3.2.5. The  3-person  4FPS4  team  provides  command  and  control  (C2)-level staff assistance at a Numbered Air Force, MAJCOM Headquarters, or forward  operating location (FOL). 3.2.6.  Attachment  10  lists  the  FES  UTC  MISCAPS  for  quick  reference;  however,  when MAJCOM  planners  source  contingency  manpower  and  vehicle  requirements  use  the  most current  UTCs  found  on  the  FES  SharePoint  at:  https://cs3.eis.af.mil/sites/OO-EN-CE-  A6/21340/OO-EN-CE-10/default.aspx 3.3. Vehicles and Equipment. The SFO will direct the placement and staging of equipment and vehicles  based  on  the  operational  needs  of  the  environment.  SFOs  identify  shortfalls  in firefighting  vehicles  and  equipment  through  an  analysis  of  operations  at  the  site.    Where              AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 13 shortages exist, request for release of assets from War Reserve Materials (WRM).  Vehicles may be leased with adequate lead time; when lead time is not available, vehicles  may be  tasked  from home  station  fleets  and  backfilled  with  leased  vehicles  as  soon    as    possible.    Additional vehicles  and  support  equipment  may  be  needed  at  any  stage  of  a  conflict.  Note:  Functional expertise is available  from the Air Force Civil Engineer Center (AFCEC)  Reachback Center  at: DSN:  523-6995;  Commercial:  (850) 283-6995, and Tyndall AFB Command  Post:  DSN:  523- 2155, Commercial: (850) 283-2155. 3.3.1.

For  unique  situations  such  as  AF  installations  without  assigned  aircraft, installations where  only  rotary  wing  or  unmanned  aircraft  are  assigned,  or  large    installations    that require  more  than  one  fire  station to  meet  emergency  response  time  standards,  consult  the appropriate AOR fire chief  for assistance. 3.4. Risk Management. Risk  requires  a  subjective  assessment  of  the  probability  that  an  FES emergency event will occur, and the expected severity of such an event.  The  probability factor relies heavily on historic emergency response data to predict  future events.  But  for contingency operations,  historical  data  is  not  available  and  assumptions  must  be  made  on  probability  and severity  IAW  AFI  90-802,  Risk  Management,  and  AFPAM  90-803,  Risk  Management  (RM) Guidelines and Tools. 3.4.1.  Risk  management  primarily  involves  allocating  resources  according  to  the  risk. Normally,  resources  are  allocated  according  to  the  most  probable time of day and day of the week that a fire emergency event will occur, from  historic fire response data. This data may not  be  available  at contingency locations.  Consequently,  the  assumption  during  initial operations  is  that  the  risk  is  static  and  the  same  level  of  capability  is  maintained continuously.  This  assumption  is  for  the  first  120  days  of  operation  then  response  data  is assessed  to determine if existing capability is still appropriate.     AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 15 3.4.2.  Probability.  Anecdotal  information  indicates  that  fire  emergency  events  are  more probable  during  contingencies  due  to  the  intensity  of  aircraft  operations,  temporary construction and the potential for enemy actions (such  as aircraft battle damage). 3.4.3. Severity.  The  severity  of  fire  emergency  events  is  expected  to  be  greater  than  for home  stations  due  to  the  use  of  combustible  materials  in  temporary  construction  and temporary wiring and the lack of an adequate water supply.               16 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 4 INSTALLATION FIREFIGHTING PLAN 4.1. Introduction.  This  chapter  outlines  tactics,  techniques,  procedures  (TTPs),  and  generic guidelines  to  enhance  the  survivability  of  firefighters,  vehicles,  equipment  and    resources during contingencies.  Provided is an overview  of  the  FES  functions  and  responsibilities  in  the contingency  environment. In  the  absence  of  formal  training  and  lesson  plans,  this  section  can be  used to present training. 4.2. Planning Period. Upon  arrival,  the  installation  fire  chief  will  create  or  review  plans  and execute training and  actions  required  to  implement  those   plans.   Deployed  firefighters  take the following actions immediately upon arrival: 4.2.1. Establish fire emergency response posture. 4.2.2. Establish  fire  prevention,  force  protection  and  firefighter  safety programs. 4.2.3. Work with emergency managers to determine response priorities. 4.2.4. Communicate  risk  and  capability  issues  to  the  installation  commander.  For  more information regarding reporting level of service capability see AFI 32-2001, chapter 6. 4.2.5. Determine and coordinate response capability available in the Readiness & Emergency Management  (R&EM)  flight.  EM  personnel  may  have  HAZMAT  response  capability (training and equipment) that can help during these types of response. 4.3.  Chain  of  Command.  The  fire  chief  must  establish  the  internal  chain  of  command, determine  the  installation’s  chain  of  command  and  disseminate  the  information  to  all firefighters. 4.3.1. Functional  Chain  of  Command.  The  fire  chief’s  geographic  AOR  dictates  functional area  reporting  to  the  appropriate  MAJCOM.  For  Joint  Task  Force  (JTF)  operations, operational  control  (OPCON)  will  be  assumed  by  the  JTF  Commander.  Administrative Control (ADCON) will be retained by the designated USAF functional manager. 4.4. Intelligence. Obtain  current  intelligence  threat  assessments  of  potential  adversary’s  ability and  intent  to  attack  the  installation,  including  the  use  of  WMD. Accurate information enables fire chiefs to tailor defensive preplanning and TTPs to mitigate the consequences of an attack. 4.5. Firefighter Safety and Health. To the maximum extent possible, NFPA 1500  shall  apply during  wartime  and  contingency  operations.  When  compliance  is    not    possible,    ORM processes  must  be  used  to  deviate  from  NFPA  requirements.  Everything  possible  must    be done  to  protect  firefighters  but  mission  comes  first,  which  may    require    doing    operations during  war  that would  not  be  done  when  at  peace.   However,  operations  or  tasks  that  cannot be performed safely will not be undertaken.              AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 17 4.6. Long  Term  Planning.  When  intelligence  indicates  the  deployment  may  become  “steady state,” the fire chief must begin long term planning after initial establishment of the installation. This  requires  the  fire  chief  to  evaluate  the  resources  in  place  to  determine  if  they  meet established  standards.  If  additional  resources  are  required,  plans  to  fix  shortfalls  must  be communicated  to  leadership.  Plan  to  improve  facilities  and  obtain  proper  manpower,  vehicles, and  equipment  for  the  fire  station.  Consider  water  distribution  systems,  utilities,  systems, command and control facilities, etc. 4.7. Plans. Plans include, but are not limited to, installation  support, mobilization, contingency response, fire prevention, training, and pre-fire plans. 4.7.1. Conducting  local  training  is and should be aligned with the Air Force FES Training Plan to ensure career field continuity.  Existing  lesson  plans  may be  utilized and new lesson plans developed as necessary. 4.7.2. To the greatest extent possible, establish  dispersal locations and  obtain  shelter assets. Place  assets  indoors  and  utilize  natural  covering  (ditches,  trees,  hillsides, trenches, etc.) as much as possible.  All dispersal sites will be splinter  protected  and  hardened  as dictated by the  threat.  Use  contamination  control  procedures  and  provide  appropriate  levels  of contamination avoidance measures  on these locations (see Attachment 2). 4.7.3.  If  the  threat  dictates,  harden  and  splinter-protect  all  non-dispersed  fire  assets, including  the  ECC  and  communication  network  as  required.  Do  not  overlook  supplies, station generators, and fuel containment dikes. 4.7.4.  Conduct  pre-fire  planning  and  train  on  mission  assigned  aircraft  and  priority facilities as soon as possible. 4.7.5. Establish fire prevention, reporting, education and safety programs. 4.7.6. Train facility occupants on fire extinguisher operations to enable quick intervention for fires in the initial stages. 4.7.7.  Survey  water  supplies  for  emergency  use.  Include  both  on  and  off  installation locations to include swimming pools, lakes, rivers, towers, tankers,  pumps, wells, and basic expeditionary  airfield  resources  (BEAR)  mobile  water  distribution  systems.  Construct expedient  access  routes  made  of  dirt  or  gravel  and  install  dry  hydrants  and  pumps  as necessary to expedite re-supply operations. 4.7.8. Coordinate  with  POL  personnel  to  ensure  drainage,  dikes  and  holding areas  are  in place.  Dikes  should  hold  1.5  times  the  container’s  capacity.  Survey  possible  fuel  holding or  tank  drainage  diversion  areas  where  spilled  fuel  can  be    burned    off.    Identify    fuel transfer  possibilities  and  determine  if  AFFF  inventories are adequate for the amount of fuel stored. 4.7.9.  Inventory  all  firefighting  agents  and  equipment;  request  high  priority  fills  for shortfalls through local supply channels and the contracting officer.                     18 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 4.8. Attack Preparation Period. The following action will be taken: 4.8.1. Maintain accountability of all personnel. 4.8.2. Establish a recall roster and system to accomplish the recall. 4.8.3. The SFO initiates appropriate checklists (see Attachments 2 thru 9). 4.8.4. Establish the ECC. 4.8.5. Define what assets are available and determine what resources are needed to support the  mission  while  meeting  appropriate  Air  Force  standards.  Initiate  shortfall    requests through  appropriate  channels.  Additional  firefighting  agents,  clothing,  equipment  and supplies  may  be  procured  through  supply  channels  (establish  good  working  relationships with Contracting and Finance). 4.8.6. When  the  threat  dictates,  firefighters  will  be  issued  chemical  warfare  ensemble  and nerve agent antidote based on the associated threat conditions. Firefighters must be prepared to utilize the JFIRE ensemble. 4.8.7. Issue weapons as threat conditions dictate.  Use selective arming as necessary. 4.8.8. Initiate dispersal plan as threat conditions warrant. 4.8.8.1.  Disperse  support  assets  (tools/equipment,  emergency  water  storage  [EWS], mobile  air  compressor,  etc.)  and  implement  physical/chemical  contamination  avoidance actions to maximize survivability. 4.8.8.2.  Disperse  vehicles  and  agents  (see  Attachment  2).  Correct  deficiencies  on vehicles/agent status. 4.8.8.3. Vehicles will remain sheltered as much as possible.  Vehicles may relocate with the approval of the SFO. 4.8.9.  Implement  survivability  measures  to  include  contamination  control  for  vehicles  and equipment. Black  out/tone-down/splinter  and  chemical  contamination  avoidance  measures will be implemented for the following resources: 4.8.9.1. Fire Station (ECC network is a very important priority).  Include radio antenna(s) and repeater(s) in the protection plan as applicable. 4.8.9.2. Dispersal sites and personnel bunkers. 4.8.9.3. EWS sites supplementing existing emergency water sources. 4.8.9.4. Agent/equipment dispersal. 4.8.10. Determine availability of installed fire suppression systems.              AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 19 4.8.11. Identify communication services for major work centers (i.e. building location, and telephone numbers) (see Table A9.4). 4.8.12. Establish the ECC and Alternate ECC. 4.8.12.1. Establish ECC work shifts. 4.8.12.2. The SFO will: 4.8.12.3. Confirm and account for all firefighting resources prior to actual response. 4.8.12.3.1. Maintain overall firefighting, fire vehicle, and equipment status. 4.8.12.3.2.  Receive   installation   control   center   directives   and   disseminate   to firefighters. 4.8.12.3.3.  Take  necessary  actions  to  reverse  or  limit  any  degradation  to  the  FES mission. 4.8.12.3.4. Ensure incident response reporting procedures are in place. 4.8.12.3. The ECC will maintain up to date information on the following: 4.8.12.3.1. Fire vehicles by call sign, type, registration number, and status. 4.8.12.3.2. Dispersal points of all resources and crew accountability 4.8.12.3.3. Quantities and location of firefighting agents. 4.8.12.3.4. Installation map to chart blocked roads, craters, UXO's, CBRN zones, air base defense (ABD) sectors, utility status and fuel and ammo storage areas. 4.8.12.3.5. List of static water locations and approximate amounts available. 4.8.12.3.6. Logbook will be used to document significant events. 4.8.12.3.7. Installation priority listing. 4.8.12.4. The ECC communications network is critical to the success of the FES mission and  recovery  operations.  Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  obtain  the  following communications devices: 4.8.12.4.1. Primary and Secondary Crash line. 4.8.12.4.2. Fire reporting lines. 4.8.12.4.3. Direct Line or dedicated line to appropriate work centers (e.g., UCC). 4.8.12.4.4. Administrative line (two or more is preferred).               20 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 4.8.12.4.5. Portable radios/batteries/charger(s). 4.8.12.4.6. Back-up generator with auto start and transfer capability. 4.8.12.5. The alternate ECC may be activated at any time. Checklists, reference material, supplies, and communications equipment should be maintained for this purpose. 4.8.12.6. Communication disruption/outages. 4.8.12.6.1. If communication systems fail, the following may be implemented: 4.8.12.6.1.1. Portables/mobile radios. 4.8.12.6.1.2. Alternate frequency. 4.8.12.6.1.3. Direct lines and runners. 4.8.12.6.1.4. Cellular telephones. 4.8.12.6.2. A complete list of telephone numbers will be maintained in the ECC and command vehicles. 4.8.12.6.3. If an authentication matrix is used, see Attachment 3. 4.8.13. Operations. 4.8.13.1. Shift  schedules  will  be  determined  by the  SFO.  Manpower  authorizations  are based  on providing  an Optimum  Level  of  Service  (OLS)  IAW  AFI 32-2001.  However SFOs are not bound by this concept and may vary the work schedule as the risk dictates. Some considerations are: Ops TEMPO, manning levels, weather conditions, wear of PPE in chemical environment, variations in risk, etc.  It should be noted that the mission may require periods when firefighters will work for extended shifts. However, extended shifts should  only  be  considered  for  limited  periods  when  needed  due  to  reduced  manning levels and mission requirements.  Working extended shifts significantly increases risk to firefighter safety.  For deployments over 90 days, work schedules should be adjusted to 72 hours per week where possible. Note: Crews will be rotated in a manner as to reduce their vulnerability to enemy attack. 4.8.13.2.  The  SFO  should  establish  response  priorities  based  on  the  installation’s emergency  management  plans,  manning/  equipment  status  and  mission  requirements. Consider things such as aircraft, structural, fuel spill, and munitions incidents. 4.8.13.3. As the threat escalates, firefighters may operate from dispersed locations. 4.8.13.4. JFIRE may be required. 4.8.13.5.  Shift  change  will  be  as  prescribed  by directives/operating instructions (OI). the  SFO  and IAW local                    AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 21 4.8.13.5.1. Assistant Chiefs (A/C) will manage shift change. 4.8.13.5.2. All firefighters must be informed of mission oriented protective posture (MOPP) level, threat condition and intelligence updates at shift change. 4.8.13.6. Crew Rotation. 4.8.13.6.1. Each firefighter will be assigned to a specific vehicle.  At the beginning of each shift, firefighters will report to their assigned vehicle at the A/Cs direction. 4.8.13.6.2.  Normally,  shift  change  will  occur  in  the  fire  station;  however,  during dispersed operations the SFO will rotate crews when safely possible. 4.8.13.6.3. Accountability for all  crews and vehicle status will be accomplished by the SFO immediately following shift change. 4.8.13.7. If firefighters are unable to report to their pre-designated location due to hostile activity,  they  will  assemble  in  an  area  designated  by  the  SFO. Transportation  to  their assigned vehicle will be arranged by the SFO as situation permits. 4.8.13.8. Off duty personnel will report to their assigned billets for rest and recuperation. The senior member must maintain accountability of all off-duty firefighters. 4.8.14. Responses and Standbys. 4.8.14.1. At heightened threat conditions, the SFO may need to coordinate all responses with the EOC. 4.8.14.2. Under SFO direction, the ECC will dispatch incidents using selective response procedures based on priority of asset. 4.8.15. Other Requirements. 4.8.15.1. Be prepared to selectively arm personnel as threat dictates. 4.8.15.2. Issue authentication matrix to each crew. 4.8.15.3. Secure  personnel  and  departmental  records  and  documentation  in  a  protected shelter or area. 4.8.15.4.  Arriving  firefighters  will  receive  necessary  briefings  and  billeting  during  in- processing. A FES supervisor will be dispatched to the receiving area to ensure a smooth transition. 4.9. Attack Response Period. This is the time period during an attack or hostile activities that firefighting and rescue activities will be limited. Survivability is the main priority while mission sustainment is the primary objective.                 22 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 4.9.1. Upon notification that an airfield attack is imminent, the ECC will alert dispersed fire crews. Crews  must  be  attentive  to  indications  of  a  change  in  alarm  condition  and  report pertinent  information  to  the  ECC  (e.g.,  observing  personnel  taking  cover,  changes  in displayed  flags,  giant  voice  announcements,  gunfire,  bomb  bursts,  etc.).  If  differences  in alarm conditions exist, take cover until the difference is resolved. 4.9.2. Personnel actions. 4.9.2.1.  Firefighters  must  be  protected  with  the  appropriate  individual  protective ensemble  (IPE)  according  to  current  alarm  conditions. They  must  be  able  to  instantly cease  any  operation  and  take  immediate  cover  in  the  event  of  an  attack.  Be  alert  to surprise and re-attack possibilities.  Always be aware of the nearest personnel bunker. 4.9.2.1.1.  Unless  specifically  directed  by  the  SFO,  do  not  perform  any  rescue/ firefighting operations except immediate area self-aid and buddy care (SABC) while attack is occurring. 4.9.2.1.2.  If  away  from  dispersal  site  when  an  attack  occurs,  DO  NOT  attempt  to return to the dispersal location.  Stop and take appropriate cover where you are. 4.9.2.2.  Personnel  in  vehicles  not  in  splinter  protected  facilities  will  seek  the  best available protection in their area. 4.9.3. Communications  will  be kept  to  an  absolute minimum  during  and  immediately after attacks.  During the attack, firefighters should provide size, activity, location, uniform, time, and equipment (SALUTE) reports to the SFO. 4.10 Attack Recovery Period. 4.10.1. Dispersed crew actions. 4.10.1.1. Upon notification that an attack is over, fire crews will immediately account for crew members, perform SABC as required, perform a thorough UXO sweep, check for damage/contamination,  and  verify  status/condition  of  assigned  assets. Report  status  to the ECC once completed. 4.10.1.2. Note UXO locations. 4.10.1.2.1. Remain  at  least  300  feet  from  UXOs;  do  not  transmit  hand-held  radios within 25 feet of UXOs or 100 feet for mobile radios. 4.10.1.2.2.  Identify,  mark,  and  report  all  UXOs  to  the  ECC  IAW  AFTTP  3-4, Airman’s Manual. 4.10.1.2.3. Make note of other UXO reports as this may alter pending response routes to future emergencies/incidents. 4.10.1.3. Note improvised explosive device (IED) locations.                   AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 23 4.10.1.3.1. Withdraw all non-essential personnel IAW AFTTP 3-4, Airman’s Manual. Personnel will be behind or under cover. 4.10.1.4.  IAW  AFMAN  91-201,  Explosives  Safety  Standards,  minimum  withdrawal distances for IEDs are: 4.10.1.4.1. 500 feet if IED is a small item or box (up to 2 cubic feet). 4.10.1.4.2. 1,000 feet if IED is a barrel or car (up to 15 cubic feet). 4.10.1.4.3. 1,500 feet if IED is a van or truck. 4.10.1.4.4. 2,000 feet if IED is larger than already described. 4.10.1.4.5.  Response  agencies  such  as  EOD  may  evaluate  and  recommend  an adjustment  to  response  distances  to  the  IC.  Withdrawal  distances  are  for  initial evacuation until command authorities and EOD personnel evaluate the incident. 4.10.1.5. Report personnel injuries/facility and asset damage. 4.10.1.6. Inspect/report M-8 and M-9 readings on vehicles and dispersed assets. 4.10.1.7. Conduct operational decontamination as required. 4.10.2. Firefighting Actions. 4.10.2.1. When directed, fire crews will proceed to the incident site. 4.10.2.2. Responding crews will report their observations to the ECC. 4.10.3. SFO actions. 4.10.3.1. The SFO/ECC will immediately announce alarm condition changes and initiate an after attack vehicle/equipment/personnel status check. 4.10.3.2. Mission sustainment and firefighter safety is the SFO’s primary concern. It may not be possible to extinguish every fire and perform every rescue, prudent judgment on when and how to engage firefighting forces is paramount to the success of the mission. The  SFO  directs  the  allocations  of  firefighting  resources  in  concert  with  command priorities  and  current  mission  sustainment  and  installation  recovery  operations.  In  the event  of  multiple  responses,  established  priority  lists  and  preplanning  should  dictate multiple response priorities.  Decisions  are usually made in  relation  to  sortie generation and aircraft recovery, depending on current response capabilities/commitments. 4.10.3.3. The ECC will establish an effective flow of communications between the SFO, appropriate work centers, and firefighting crews. 4.10.3.4. The SFO exercises primary control of responding vehicles.  Normally, the A/C will  command  the  fire  ground;  however,  crew  chiefs  may  perform  this  function  on                  24 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 multiple  incidents.  The  following  considerations  govern  what  vehicles,  if  any,  are dispatched to incidents: 4.10.3.4.1. Equipment/agent availability. 4.10.3.4.2. Alarm condition. 4.10.3.4.3. Access to incident. 4.10.3.4.4. Firefighting crew status. 4.10.3.4.5. Priority. 4.10.3.4.6. Physical security. 4.10.4. Responses. 4.10.4.1.  The  EOC  director,  through  the  SFO,  approves  responses  before  dispatch. Responding  crews  will  not  deviate  from  their  assignment  to  render  assistance  at  other incidents.  They will  however,  report their  observations to the ECC.  Resource priorities are listed in the facility priority list; this must be maintained in the ECC and as required by the SFO. 4.10.4.2. When necessary, use the authentication matrix prior to responding to validate all responses or orders (see Attachment 3). 4.10.4.3. If damages exceed firefighting capability, the SFO will recommend “Let Burn” to the EOC director.  Firefighter safety is the first consideration. 4.10.4.4. Interior fire operations should only be attempted if there is high probability for successful fire stop to a mission essential asset or rescue. 4.10.4.5. Debris, UXOs and other hazards may hinder response.  Make every attempt to stay on  the hard surface.  If possible, do not drive or walk through  contaminated areas, puddles or vapors; find an alternate route. If leaving the hard surface becomes necessary, use spotters in front of the vehicle to sweep for UXOs 4.10.5. Re-attack actions. 4.10.5.1. The SFO must consider ceasing all operations that are not mission essential. 4.10.5.2. Crews  should  evaluate  the location/status  of  available  cover  at  every incident site. 4.10.5.3. At the conclusion of the reattack, revert to attack recovery actions. 4.10.6. Communications. 4.10.6.1. Plans should be in place in the event the ECC is destroyed.           AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 25 4.10.6.2. In the event the primary ECC is inoperable, the ECC operator will relocate to the alternate ECC. 4.10.6.3.  If  all  communication  channels  are  jammed  or  inoperative  for  any  reason, communications  between  firefighting  units  will  be  by  any  means  available  (i.e., portables/mobile radios, alternate frequency, direct lines and runners, cellular telephones, public address systems, etc.). 4.10.6.4. A  verification  matrix  will  be  distributed to  each  vehicle to  verify information passed over the radio net.  This matrix will be changed if compromise is suspected. 4.11. Administration and Logistics. 4.11.1. Vehicle and manpower calculations can be made utilizing the appropriate Air Force publications.  Shortfalls must be up channeled through the appropriate authority. 4.11.2. Manpower replacements  must  be made through  PERSCO  and  coordinated  through the commander. 4.11.3.  Firefighting  equipment  and  agents  may  be  obtained  locally.  Quickly  identify shortfalls and request through local established procedures. 4.11.4. When appropriate add critical contractors to the entry access list i.e., HAZMAT clean up companies, fire truck maintenance, etc. 4.11.5. Consider mutual aid agreements when feasible.                 26 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 5 JFIRE CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS 5.1. General. The purpose of this  chapter is  to establish procedures  for utilizing the JFIRE in CBRN environments. 5.1.1. JFIRE is designed specifically for a wartime mission that allows firefighters to operate in  CBRN  environments,  engage  fires,  effect  rescue  and  transition  between  filtered  air  and supplied air. 5.1.2. LIMFACS. The firefighter is using two complete protective ensembles when using the JFIRE,  a  firefighting  gear  and  a  battle  dress  overgarment  (BDO).  This  causes  increased physical  stress  for  the  firefighter. Rehabilitation  after  engaging  in  emergency  response  is necessary. 5.2. Concepts. Due to the extra stress placed on fire fighters under JFIRE conditions it is highly recommended  to  limit  responses  to  defensive  operations  as  much  as  practical. The  danger  of exhausting fire fighters has a greater impact than losing an inconsequential facility or asset. 5.2.1. Exterior. 5.2.1.1. The  main  firefighting  objective  is  to  minimize  the  spread  of  fire  to  exposures, especially  those  that  have  a  direct impact  on the  mission.  Firefighting  is normally accomplished using vehicle turrets or master streams. 5.2.1.2.  Firefighters  may  assume  MOPP  4  non-firefighting  posture  or  MOPP  4 firefighting posture as determined by the SFO. 5.2.2. Interior (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH)). 5.2.2.1.  Offensive  interior  operations  will  only  be  conducted  when  necessary  to  save mission critical  assets  or to rescue personnel  and  will  only occur when directed by the SFO. 5.2.2.2. Prior  to  entry,  the  attack  crew  or  incident  commander  (IC)  will  announce  that entry  is  being  made. At  this  time  the  ECC  will  acknowledge  the  entry  and  announce “Start the 5-Minute Tick.”  The 5-Minute Tick guidelines are as follows: 5.2.2.2.1. As soon as the attack crew makes entry, a 5-minute countdown will begin and the ECC will maintain the count. At the 5-minute mark, the ECC will inform the IC  that  the  5-Minute  Tick  has  expired. The  IC  will  ensure  the  interior  crews  are informed.  At  this  time,  communications  between  the  attack  crew  and  IC  become critical. The IC requires a status report that can help him/her make a tactical decision as to whether or not to continue interior fire attack.       AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 27 5.2.2.2.2. At the 10-minute mark, the ECC will again inform the IC and, in turn, the attack  crew.  The  IC  will  also  advise  the  interior  crew  to  complete  their  task  or withdraw at the 15-minute mark. 5.2.2.2.3. At the 15-minute mark, the attack crew may be ordered to withdraw from the facility for rehabilitation. If there is a delay in withdrawal, the IC will employ the rapid intervention team (RIT). The RIT can perform other fire ground duties as long as they do not hinder their primary objective of providing rescue for the attack team if required. 5.3. Procedures. Complete procedures for employing the JFIRE are contained in T.O. 14P3-1- 181, Joint-Firefighter Integrated Response Ensemble (J- FIRE). 5.4. Work/Rest  Cycles  (WRC).  WRCs  will  be  enforced  for  firefighters.  WRC  will  be  at  the direction  of the  IC.  As rest  cycles  do  not  exclude firefighting activities,  priority responses  are still  likely  to  be  mounting.  However,  the  IC  must  consider  the  WRC  when  deciding  attack modes and fire ground tasks.  Note: Refer to Chapter 8 for further guidance.               28 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 6 CONTAMINATION AVOIDANCE AND DECONTAMINATION 6.1. General.  This  chapter  establishes  procedures  for  detecting  contamination  and  subsequent decontamination.  More  detailed  information  can  be  found  in  Air  Force  Manual  10-2503, Operations  in  a  Chemical,  radiological,  nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosive  (CBRNE) Environment. 6.2. Detection. 6.2.1.  When  directed  by  the  EOC  Director  or  CE  Commander,  all  personnel,  vehicles, facilities, shelters and equipment will have M-8 paper/M-9 tape appropriately applied. 6.2.2.  All  personnel  will  carry  M-8  paper  for  random  sampling  of  specific  items  when necessary. 6.2.3. Notify the ECC when contamination is evident.  After reporting, accomplish expedient decon and wait for further direction from the leadership or the ECC. 6.3. Operational Decontamination. 6.3.1.  All  dispersal  sites  should  have  the  materials  listed  in  Table  6.1  on  hand  for decontamination. Table 6.1. Suggested Decontamination Materials for Dispersal Sites. Bucket Scrubbing brushes Plastic trash bags Bug sprayer Plastic bags Bleach Rags/sponges and/or wiping clothes Reactive Skin Decontamination Lotion (RSDL)M295 Tape and pens/markers for marking contaminated waste Rubber bands to seal self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) bottle connections 6.3.2. When contamination is suspected: 6.3.2.1.  Report  M-8  paper/M-9  tape  readings  to  the  ECC.    Decontamination    efforts should  be  limited  to  those  actions  necessary  to  meet  mission  requirements.  Always minimize the risk of exposure and contact hazard to personnel and equipment. 6.3.2.2.  When  directed,  contaminated  personnel  should  report decontamination. to  a  CCA  for 6.3.2.3.  For  minor  contamination,  spot  decontamination  procedures  should  be accomplished. Contaminated  material  should  be  placed  in  plastic  bags  for  appropriate disposal at predetermined unit contaminated waste collection points. 6.3.2.4. For gross contamination, use bleach and water solution to decontaminate.         AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 6.4. Barrier Material. 29 6.4.1. Calculate  how  much  barrier  material  will  be  required  to  protect  critical  assets  from chemical contamination (e.g. repellent plastic sheets, canvas, tarpaulins, etc.). 6.4.2. Cover critical assets when directed by leadership IAW procedures listed in AFTTP 3-4 and follow local procedures after a chemical attack. 6.4.3.  Chemically  Contaminated  Object  Rule.  (CCOR).  CCOR  applies  when  chemical contamination is liquid in nature (e.g. this special handling procedures will not be necessary past the point of the hazard duration of the major terrain surface when the resource has been exposed  only to  agents  in  vapor  or  dusty  form.). This  rule  applies  to  assets  that  were  not protected by a barrier material and therefore pose a percutaneous and/or vapor hazard. 6.4.4.  In  relation  to  the  CCOR,  objects  are  considered  either  small  or  large  and  hazard distances directly correlate to the size of the object. For all intents and purposes, firefighters should  be  aware  that  a  large  object  encompasses  resources  that  have  more  than  10  square meters of metal and/or glass surfaces.  Examples include 44-passenger buses, fuel trucks, P- 19 fire trucks, and all aircraft.  Based on the size of the object, the hazard distances will be different. Table 6.4.  Simplified CCOR Guidelines                30 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 7 DISPERSAL SITE PROCEDURES 7.1. General. Dispersal  management  is  a  means  of  physically tracking  and  protecting assets at dispersal sites. 7.2. Dispersal Site Procedures. 7.2.1. The oncoming shift crew will ensure items are inventoried at shift change.   Annotate results and pass the information to the ECC. 7.2.2. Arrange resources to enhance their accessibility in shelters. 7.2.3. Dispersal sites should not be within 300 feet of a priority facility. 7.2.4. Terrain and prevailing winds should be considered when hardening/splinter protecting 7.3. General Considerations. 7.3.1. Only one ARFF or structural vehicle should be dispersed to the same location.   Tone down and properly mark all vehicles for chemical detection and avoidance. 7.3.2. Separate vehicles housed in the station as much as possible. 7.3.3. Arrange dispersal points so that not more than two sites are in a straight target line. 7.3.4. Disperse one ARFF vehicle so that it has a view of the active runway. 7.3.5. Firefighters will ensure vehicles and equipment are protected from direct attack. Each vehicle  will  be  equipped  with  a  first  aid  kit,  UXO/contamination  marking  kit  and  an operational decontamination kit. 7.3.6.  Contamination  avoidance  techniques  will  be  utilized.  All  assets  will  be  splinter protected, covered in plastic and marked with chemical detection material.             AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 31 Chapter 8 HEAT EXHAUSTION AND WORK/REST CYCLES 8.1. Introduction. This section establishes guidance for making decisions on firefighter WRCs while  operating  in  JFIRE  ensembles. Successfully  functioning  in  a  contingency  environment depends on understanding the factors contributing to heat stress, knowing and implementing the preventive measures and maintaining constant observation of personnel for risk factors and signs of  heat  illness.  Hot  and/or  humid  environments  severely  exacerbate  heat  stress  and  lead  to extreme heat exhaustion for firefighting crews who are performing emergency operations. 8.2. Responsibilities. All personnel will become familiar with the provisions of this section. All personnel should drink as much as possible and stay hydrated, during all MOPP conditions. It is important  to  reinforce  that  water  alone  is  not  sufficient  at  “hydrating”  firefighting  crews. Balanced electrolyte consumption (from both electrolyte based powders/drinks and consumption of MREs, UGRs  and  other food  sources  [natural  salts]) is  essential  to the nutritional  needs  of firefighters  operating  in  a  CBRNE  environment.  Beware  of  existing  climatic  conditions  and prepare and react accordingly.  The SFO can alter these procedures if necessary. 8.2.1. SFO.  The  SFO  will  consider  the  circumstances  of  each  incident  and  make  adequate provisions  early  in  the  incident  for  a  WRC,  or  rest  and  rehabilitation,  for  all  personnel operating at the scene. 8.2.2. Crew Chiefs. All crew chiefs will maintain awareness of the condition of each member operating within their span of control and ensure adequate steps are taken to provide for each member’s safety and health. 8.2.3. Firefighters. All firefighters should remain aware of the health and safety of other crew members. 8.3. Terms. 8.3.1.  Dehydration.  Following  the  loss  of  sweat,  water  must  be  consumed  to  replace  the body’s loss of fluids. If the body fluid lost through sweating is not replaced, dehydration will follow. Whenever consumption of water fails to keep up with output of sweat, the body will become progressively dehydrated.  Thirst is a poor indicator of dehydration.  Dehydration is possible without any signs of thirst; mental and physical performance can degrade so slowly that individuals may not recognize the problem in themselves or others. 8.3.2.  Heat  Exhaustion.  This  condition  appears  as  marked  fatigue  and  weakness,  nausea, dizziness,  fainting,  vomiting,  elevated  body  temperature,  and  disorientation.  Factors  that compound  heat  exhaustion  are  lack  of  acclimatization  and  failure  to  replace  water  lost  in sweat. 8.3.3. Heat Stroke. This is a medical emergency that is caused when the body stops sweating, leading  to  loss  of  evaporative  cooling  and  a  dangerous  rise  in  core  temperature.  It  can include all of the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion, but is more severe and can be fatal. One heat casualty is usually followed by others. 32     AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 8.3.4. IPE. Insulating effects of IPE occur even when ambient temperature and humidity are relatively  low.  Variations  to  MOPP  levels,  such  as  opening  or  removing  the  jacket,  or removing  some  or  all  of  the  firefighter  proximity  clothing,  will  reduce  barriers  to  body cooling.  Therefore,  the  SFO  must  conduct  risk  analyses  to  balance  performing  mission critical tasks,  casualties due to  actual  CBRN threat,  and  degraded performance due to heat stress, dehydration, and bulkiness of the protective equipment. 8.3.5. Acclimatization. Unacclimated personnel are those who have not built up a tolerance for  working  in  a  hot  environment.  They  will  experience  degraded  mental  and  physical performance  and be highly susceptible to heat  illness.  Persons who are  poorly conditioned become fatigued more easily and do not adjust to working in excessive climatic conditions as quickly as those in good physical condition. AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 33 8.4. Heat Illness Prevention. 8.4.1.  The  key  to  preventing  heat  illness  and  sustaining  performance  is  knowledge  of preventive measures.  Utilize the heat stress index tables in Table 8.1 for general guidance. Be aware these tables require temperature/humidity level input from a  competent authority such as the weather flight for complete accuracy.       Table 8.1. Heat Stress Index.

Water is critical for maintaining health and individual performance, since the human body is highly dependent on water to cool itself in a hot environment.  All water consumed must  be  from  a  medically  approved  source  to  prevent  waterborne  illnesses.  All  personnel should  ensure there is  an  adequate supply of  drinking water  protected  from  biological  and chemical  fallout  at  each  dispersal  site. Canteens  must  be  kept  full;  ensure  individuals  are trained  on  the  proper  techniques  to  fill  canteens  in  a  contaminated  environment.  It  is important  to  reinforce  that  water  alone  is  not  sufficient  at  “hydrating”  firefighting  crews. Balanced  electrolyte  consumption  (from  both  electrolyte  based  powders/drinks  and consumption  of  MREs,  UGRs  and  other  food  sources  [natural  salts])  is  essential  to  the nutritional needs of firefighters operating in CBRN conditions. 34 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 8.4.3. Increased sweating requires additional water consumption. As mentioned earlier, thirst alone is not a good indicator of adequate fluid intake. Personnel always need to drink before they feel thirsty.  They must drink small amounts of water frequently rather than drink large amounts  occasionally.  When  IPE  is  worn  in  an  extreme  heat  environment,  water requirements are more than 20 quarts per day. 8.5. WRC. 8.5.1.  To  prevent  a  dangerous  increase  in  body  temperature,  heat  production  must  be minimized  by  reducing  work  pace  and  increasing  rest  periods.  In  very  hot  and  humid conditions,  reducing  the  duration  of  physical  activity  may  be  the  only  way  to  prevent dangerous increases in body temperature. WRC recommendations, as advised by AFTTP 3- 4, are provided in Table 8.2. This table is to be used by the SFO when determining fire crew WRCs. 8.5.2.  Allow  personnel  to  seek  relief  periodically  from  potentially  dangerous  heat  stress situations by resting in shaded or air conditioned areas (vehicle cabs), and by removing IPE and firefighter PPE.  Rotating dispersed crews to the station for rest/rehabilitation will assist in affecting this means. 8.5.3. Even moderate exertion in MOPP gear can cause heat illness at lower Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) indices.  When IPE is worn, add 10° F to the measured WBGT index. 8.5.4. Avoid resting directly on the hot ground.  The ground heated by the sun can be 30-45 degrees hotter than the air.             Notes: 1. WRC  recommendations  are  based  on  personnel  who  are  fully acclimatized, optimally conditioned, hydrated and rested. 2. If IPE/firefighter PPE is worn, add 10 deg F to the WBGT index. 3. Water intake shown supports WRCs. When WRCs cannot be applied due to  mission  critical  requirements  such  as  firefighting  in  support  of  sortie generation, add 1/2 to 1 more quarts per hour to values shown in table. 4. This guidance  is  not  a  substitute  for  common  sense  and  experience; the appearance of heat casualties is a sure sign that the safe limit of work time has been exceeded and/or water consumption is inadequate.

General. This section establishes procedures for actions to be taken under alarm conditions of  yellow,  red/blue  and  black.  FES  actions  when  under  attack  require  determining,  within certain guidelines, the amount of firefighters and apparatus to respond to incidents. This section should be used to supplement locally developed checklists. 9.2. Alarm Yellow. 9.2.1. Implement MOPP as directed by the installation commander. 9.2.2. Conduct fire response as directed by the SFO. 9.3. Alarm Red/Blue. 9.3.1. Implement MOPP 4 or as directed by the installation commander. 9.3.2. If Alarm Red or Blue is declared, it is imperative that firefighters know what type of attack  is  occurring  (e.g.,  tactical  ballistic  missile,  aircraft,  or  ground  forces). The  ECC  or SFO must notify fire crews by radio of the type of attack.  Firefighter actions based on the type of attack are as follows: 9.3.2.1.  Tactical  Ballistic  Missile  (TBM).  Firefighters  dispersed  around  the  base  will remain in their fire vehicles and assume directed MOPP. Consider shutting down HVAC in  vehicle  to  prevent  vapors  from  being  ingested  into  the  system.  This  action  is  based upon  the  concept  that  a  TBM  is  not  guided  and  has  no  predetermined  target  prior  to launch.  If a hardened facility or overhead shelter for the vehicle is nearby, it should be utilized. Personnel  outside  their  fire  vehicle  during  attack  and  unable  to  expeditiously return  to  their  vehicle  should  seek  shelter  in  the  nearest  hardened  facility  or  overhead cover.  Avoid the following locations: 9.3.2.1.1. Within 500 feet of aircraft. 9.3.2.1.2. Within 1,000 feet of POL or munitions storage facilities. 9.3.2.2. Aircraft Attack. Firefighters dispersed around the base will immediately exit their fire vehicle, seek shelter in a pre-constructed personnel bunker or hardened facility, and assume  the  directed  MOPP. This  action  is  based  upon  the  concept  that  attack  aircraft have the ability to see targets on the ground.  Avoid the following locations: 9.3.2.2.1. Inside/beneath fire trucks or any other vehicle. 9.3.2.2.2. Within 300 feet of a priority facility. 9.3.2.2.3. Within 500 feet of aircraft. 9.3.2.2.4. Within 1000 feet of POL or munitions storage facilities.          36 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 9.3.2.3. Ground Forces. Firefighters dispersed around the base will first determine where the  ground  forces  attack  is  occurring  in  relation  to  their  location.  Firefighters  in  close proximity  to  attack  will  either  establish  defensive  fighting  positions  or  leave  the immediate area as soon as possible if it is safe to do so.  Firefighters not in the ground forces  attack  sector  will  monitor  radio  transmissions  and  be  prepared  to  react  if  their sector  becomes  involved. Firefighting  activities  should  not  be  conducted  in  the  attack area until it is declared secure by security forces. 9.3.3.  Movement  of  FES  vehicles  during  Alarm  Red/Blue  conditions  will  only  be accomplished with direct authority of the SFO and EOC director. Unless directed, fire crews will remain in place during Alarm Red/Blue until told to proceed.  Firefighters must remain vigilant for any attack related threat or damage to themselves and the installation. Any such threat noted will be radioed to the SFO for broadcast to other firefighters (use the SALUTE method of reporting as outlined in the Airman’s Manual). 9.4. Alarm Black. 9.4.1. Implement MOPP 4 or as directed by the installation commander. 9.4.2. Following the declaration of Alarm Black by the EOC, firefighters are required to take an  array  of  actions. First  and  foremost  is  to  ensure  the  crew  is  not  injured  or  otherwise affected by the attack.  After determining the status of the crew, firefighters will report their status to the ECC.  A thorough sweep of the immediate dispersal site is imperative.  Crews should concentrate on those areas that could jeopardize their response to emergencies or their safety.  All vehicles moving during Alarm Black must be coordinated and approved by the EOC director.  Crews will not move their vehicle unless directed by the SFO. 9.4.3. When  performing  standby  duty,  firefighters  must  be  prepared  to  react  to  any  given wartime  scenario  in  case  an  Alarm  Black  is  declared.  Concerns  such    as    condition    of response  routes  to  the  standby,  existing  UXO  and  hostilities  in  the  standby  area  must  be addressed.  Once  on  scene,  full  attention  to  the  standby  is  paramount.  Fire  crews  must  be ready  to  react  to  any  possible  situations  requiring  their  assistance. The  following  are  two standby scenarios and actions to be taken during wartime standby situations. 9.4.3.1.  There  may  be  times  when  fire  crews  will  have  to  perform  standby  while remaining  at  their  dispersal  location.  Two  examples  of  this  situation  are  when  there might be simultaneous standby requirements or when crews have been directed to remain in their dispersal location by the SFO.  Fire crews will confirm the standby location and select the best possible response route based on current base situational reports of UXO, bomb craters and other response route factors. Crews must be prepared to respond in the appropriate  MOPP  condition  and  firefighting  posture. Visual  confirmation  of  standby from  the  dispersal  site  is  most  desired  if  possible.  If  this  is  not  possible,  crews  will coordinate with maintenance control through the ECC. 9.4.3.2. The most desirable location for firefighters to perform standby operations is as close  to  the  area  as  possible  with  an  unobstructed  view  of  the  area.  Crews  must  be prepared to respond should anything happen during the standby. Firefighters must locate an  appropriate  area  to  seek  cover  (e.g.,  hardened  aircraft  shelters  [HAS]  or  other       AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 37 appropriate “safe areas”) should re-attack occur during the standby. If no adequate cover is available, firefighters will remain in their vehicle during a TBM attack and will exit the vehicle for protection during an aircraft attack.  SOF attacks will be dealt with in one of two ways: firefighters will either return fire to combat SOF or leave the immediate area as soon as possible. 9.4.3.3. Ops-tempo may increase to the point where fire resources may not be available to meet established fire protection standards. When this occurs, implement ORM; consider optimum positioning of fire equipment, limiting aircraft maintenance or changing hours, etc. 9.4.3.4.  SFO  should  utilize  T.O.  00-25-172,  Ground  Servicing  of  Aircraft  and  Static Grounding/Bonding, for fire protection standby operation requirements. 9.5. Observing MOPP. 9.5.1. Firefighters will not reduce MOPP level until validated and directed by the SFO.                 38 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 10 VEHICLE OPERATIONS 10.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for FES vehicle operations. 10.2. Daily Maintenance. 10.2.1.

General.  This  chapter  establishes  procedures  when  utilizing  radios  as  a  means  of communication. Radio communication procedures and discipline may be defined as the process of  maintaining  clear,  decisive,  open  channels  of  communication  with  as  little  confusion  and repetition as possible. 12.2. Transmissions. 12.2.1. Speak in plain language saying what you mean, i.e., unit responding, on location, in service, etc. 12.2.2. Vehicles may be assigned letter designation IAW their real world vehicle radio call sign  (e.g.,  Crash  10  will  become  Charlie  10).  Also,  designators  for  A  and  B shift  may be employed (e.g., Alpha or Bravo 10). Vehicles will use these letter designations as call signs. Personnel  may  be  assigned  letter  designations  also  (e.g.,  Bravo-10;  1,  2,  and  3).  An alternative to this is to code name the vehicle (e.g., Jackpot) and designate the personnel as 1, 2, and 3 (CC, DO, back-seater). 12.3.  Authentication  Matrix.  Authentication  matrix  should  be  used transmissions.  All personnel should update their matrix as codes are used. to  verify  radio 12.4. Duress Signal. 12.4.1. Firefighters under duress should communicate the assigned duress words to the ECC followed by as much information as possible (i.e., location, and nature of problem, injuries, etc.).  Firefighters will then wait for direction from ECC or SFO. 12.4.2. If a firefighter under duress is unable to orally transmit a duress message, a secondary means should be established. 12.5. Discipline. Radio transmissions  are  reserved for pertinent  communications  only.  General conversation  and  chit-chat  must  be avoided  to keep  vital  channels open  and prevent  efforts  to locate dispersed units through tracking devices.               AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 43 Chapter 13 SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARTUS AIR SUPPLY 13.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures for SCBA air supply operations. 13.2. Refilling. 13.2.1. SCBA  cylinders  will  not  be  filled  while  potential  CBRN  contamination  conditions exist. 13.2.2. SCBA cylinders will be filled by qualified personnel only.  A bottle fill log will  be used with annotations denoting bottle number, date filled and firefighter’s printed name and signature. 13.3. Decontamination. 13.3.1. If M-8 or M-9 paper shows contamination, attempt to decontaminate the breathing air equipment cover before removing. 13.3.2. Dispose of the contaminated cover at an appropriate disposal site. 13.4. Breathing Air Re-servicing. 13.4.1.  All  cylinders  requiring  servicing  are  filled  during  attack  preparation.  Plastic caps/covers will be put on spare bottles to keep contaminants out. 13.4.2. Disperse  as  many  spare  bottles  as  possible  with  vehicles.  The  air  filtration  system and associated equipment will be stored in a suitable shelter and covered with plastic. 13.4.3. The air compressor intake valves and filters will be covered and taped closed. The air filtration system will be sealed in plastic. M8/M9 chemical detection paper will be affixed to the top and sides of air compressors to aid in identification and contamination avoidance. 13.4.4. Additional filter sets for the purification system will be stored in plastic bags. 13.4.5.  SCBA  re-servicing  will  not  be  conducted  during  an Alarm  Red/Black  condition where there is a potential chemical presence.          44 AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 Chapter 14 INSTALLATION UTILITY OUTAGES 14.1. General. This chapter establishes procedures in the event of utility outages. 14.2.  Water.  When  water  services  are  interrupted,  every  effort  should  be  made  to  conserve water. Out of service hydrants should be annotated on all maps. Crews should resupply vehicles as necessary utilizing existing EWS systems. 14.3. Sewage. When sewage service is interrupted, all personnel should make efforts to not over tax  the  waste  treatment  plant,  or  drains  tied  to  the  plant,  by  dumping  excess  water  from firefighting operations or decontamination efforts into the system. 14.4.  Telephone.  When  telephone  services  are  interrupted,  communication  must  be  made  by runner, radio or field phone/cell phone. 14.5. Gas. When gas service is interrupted, all units should be notified. In the event of a fire or gas  leak,  FES  should  make  efforts  to  contain  or  terminate  the  fire  or  leak.  It  may  become necessary to shut-off other facility utilities to prevent fire or damage. 14.6. Electrical.  When  electrical  service is  interrupted  to  the ECC,  auxiliary power  should  be utilized.  Consideration  for  finding  an  alternative  electrical  source  to  recharge  batteries  and portable devices should take immediate priority if the auxiliary power source fails (i.e., generator on vehicles). 14.7. Radio Service. It may become necessary to align vehicles in the field to act as repeaters for long distance transmissions.  The ECC or SFO will manage this coordination on the scene.              AFTTP 3-32.41, 26 April 2016 45 Chapter 15 CONTINGENCY FIRE PREVENTION 15.1. General. This  chapter describes unique fire prevention and  inspection issues to consider when operating in a contingency environment. 15.2. Standards compliance. As with firefighter occupational safety and health and all aspects of fire emergency services, our goal is to meet the same criteria at deployed locations as we do at home. However; this is not practical for example when operating at locations for short durations and  using  expedient  construction  methods.  On  the  other  hand  once  a  location  becomes “enduring”; fire chiefs must consider adhering to established criteria as outlined in DoDIs, AFIs, Unified  Facility  Criteria,  Engineering  Technical  Letters,  NFPA  codes,  and  other  relevant engineering and prevention documents. 15.3 Facility Plans Reviews. FES Flights will conduct plans reviews as required and coordinate with MAJCOM/AOR fire chief and engineering staff when needed 15.4. Reference Material.

At contingency locations, it is likely that firefighters will be engaged in mission essential FES tasks. In such situations, firefighters may be unable to respond to incidents involving lesser priorities  as  listed  in  base  emergency  management  plans.  Therefore,  fire  prevention  training becomes crucial so non-firefighting personnel can intervene early to extinguish small fires. A6.2.  Chapter  5  in  AFPAM  10-219,  Volume  3,  provides  additional  information  for  auxiliary firefighting  tactics  and training.  The  following  checklist  provides  a  brief  overview  of  fire fighting actions. Table A6.1. Auxiliary Firefighting. GENERAL FIREFIGHTING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES D  Know location & operation of fire extinguishers prior to needing them. D  Fight small fires within limitations of extinguisher & personal training. D Always operate using buddy system; work in teams. D Maintain fire escape route to your back and never allow fire to get be- tween you & your way out. D For auxiliary firefighters trained to utilize fire hoses/nozzles and fire pumps, always perform within the realms of your training. D Always remember, if fire gets out of control, evacuate & try to contain fire to building from outside.  Limit spread of fire to adjacent structures. BASIC FIREFIGHTING METHODS D Preventing fires is always the best line of defense. Methods D Do not enter a burning building to fight a fire. D If fire is found in early stages of development, the appropriate fire extinguisher can extinguish the fire. BASIC FIREFIGHTING METHODS Methods D Auxiliary firefighters with proper training can utilize hose streams from exterior in order to control the spread of fire. D A fuel fire can be put out with a portable fire extinguisher. D Do not allow flowing fuel to flow towards you. D Do not stand in puddles of fuel. D If fuel tank has ruptured; do not attempt to fight the fire. D Remove exposures if this can be done safely. D Never use water on an electrical fire. D Only use type C fire extinguishers.
