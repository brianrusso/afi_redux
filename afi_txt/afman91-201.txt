Major changes include incorporation of GM1; expansion of blast effects on personnel; updates weather watch/warning procedures; expansion of protective design construction requirements; and the deletion of Chapter 9, Protection of Electro-Explosive Devices From Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) and its replacement with a chapter on Munitions Potentially Presenting and Explosive Hazard.  The HERO information previously presented in Chapter 9 is available in AFI 91-208, Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) Certification and Management.  It also includes guidance for overpressure barricade design;  clarification of chocking requirements for explosives-loaded vehicles (e.g., munitions materials handling equipment (MMHE) and materials handling equipment (MHE));  updates to electromagnetic radiation (EMR) formulas for pulsed systems;  clarifies withdrawal procedures for ammunition and explosives (AE) not involved in a fire;  updates compatibility requirements for licensed location; adopts new rounding rules used for quantity distance (QD) calculations;  updates QD criterion for various facility types and situations;  and, corrects and updates notes used in QD tables.  Furthermore, it removes written Commander acceptance requirements for parking aircraft at less than survivability;  reduces coordination host/tenant requirements for explosives site plans (ESP) (may also be referred to as a QD safety submission (QDSS)) without exceptions;  removes references and procedures for Risk Based Siting;  includes additional chapters for Real Property, Waste Military Munitions, Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH); Unexploded Ordnance (UXO); includes review elements for both munitions response explosives safety submissions (MRESS) and munitions response explosives site plan (MRESP) packages;  and incorporates use of a revised Automated Explosives Safety Siting Program for use in developing ESPs.  Additionally, this Manual introduces new phraseology for an MRESS, formerly an explosives safety submission (ESS);  a munitions response chemical safety submission (MRCSS), formerly a chemical safety submission (CSS);  and an MRESP, formerly an explosives site plan (ESP) when referring to munitions response activities under the Military Munitions Response Program (MMRP).

Purpose 1.1.1.  The purpose of this Manual is to implement AFPD 91-2, Safety Programs, and DoD 6055.09-M and establish an Air Force Weapons Safety program to: 1.1.2.  Provide the maximum possible protection to people and property  from the potential damaging  effects  of  DoD  military  munitions,  explosive  and  chemical.    Applying  the standards herein provides only the minimum protection criteria for personnel and property, and greater protection must always be provided when practicable. 1.1.3.  Minimize  exposures  consistent  with  safe  and  efficient  operations  (i.e.,  expose  the minimum number of people for the minimum time to the minimum amount of explosives or chemical agents (CAs)).  This maxim is known as the cardinal principle of explosives safety. 1.1.4.  Observe explosives safety practices during all operations that include the use of live explosives. 1.1.5.  Comply with DoD and Air Force explosives safety and environmental standards. 1.2.  Scope. 1.2.1.  The provisions of this Manual apply: 1.2.1.1.  Whenever  any  explosives,  propellant,  or  similar  Hazard  Class  1  energetic materials  or  other  ammunition  items  in  Classes  2  through  9  are  present  on  Air  Force-owned or leased facilities (except as allowed in paragraph 1.2.1.3.), or are in the custody and control of Air Force civilian or military personnel (see paragraph 3.5.1.2.). 1.2.1.2.  Whenever United States (US)-titled AE are in the custody of Air Force civilian or military personnel, or Air Force contractors (except as allowed in paragraph 1.2.1.3.). 1.2.1.3.  At Air Force-owned and contractor-operated facilities, as specified by contract, the  Procuring  Contract  Officer  (PCO)  will  ensure  explosives  safety  requirements  and procedures  for  compliance  with  current  DoD  and  Air  Force  guidance  must  be  clearly specified in the contract. (T-0).  The contracting officer provides appropriate portions of DoD 4145.26-M, DoD Contractor’s Safety Manual for Ammunition and Explosives to the contractor.  Weapons safety personnel from the organization responsible for the contract will advise the contractor on DoD and Air Force explosives safety standards specified in the  contract.  (T-0).    In  the  event  explosive  safety  requirements  are  not  specified  in  a contract, apply the provisions of DoD 4145.26-M. 1.2.1.4.  When  DoD  AE  are  located  in  overseas  areas,  comply  with  US  AE  safety standards  to  the  extent  consistent  with  appropriate  international  agreements  and/or arrangements  with  the  host  country  concerned.  (T-0).    Ensure  host-nation  officials receive  appropriate  notification  of  explosives-related  activities.  (T-1).    When  DoD  AE are  located  in  overseas  areas,  comply  with  US  AE  safety  standards  except  when AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 29 compliance  with more restrictive local standards is made mandatory  by  an appropriate international  agreement.  (T-1).    When  such  ammunition  is  not  in  US  custody,  comply with US standards to the extent consistent with agreements or arrangements with the host country concerned. (T-1).  If Air Force civilian or military personnel occupy leased bases within  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  countries,  also  apply  the  safety distances in Allied Ammunition Storage and Transport Publication (AASTP)-1, Manual of  NATO  Safety  Principles  for  the  Storage  of  Military  Ammunition  and  Explosives,  to exposures outside the base boundary and NATO criteria to host-nation exposed sites (ES) within the base. (T-0). 1.2.1.5.  To Air Force personnel and facilities exposed by any other potential explosion site (PES), whether it is DoD, host-nation, or commercial AE, Commanders will ensure that  US  personnel  and  US-titled  munitions  are  accorded  the  quantity-distance  (QD) separation standards required by the Air Force and by DoD, even at foreign locations. (T-1).  U.S. units will document their adherence to these standards by showing that US ESs are located at the required separation distances from host-nation PESs.  US ESs will be licensed according to Chapter 14, and host-nation PESs identified in ESPs. (T-1).  The identification of host-nation PESs does not constitute “siting” because the US does not authorize AE for host-nation facilities not under US control.  If a violation of Air Force or DoD QD criteria to US targets is possible based on this analysis, obtain a waiver or exemption as outlined in Section 1B. (T-0)  If correction of the problem is beyond US capabilities, notify the host-nation Commander by  letter from the waiver or exemption approval  level.  (T-0)    Attach  to  this  letter  enough  information  to  convey  the  location, nature  and  extent  of  the  potential  explosives  hazards.    While  other  countries  are  not obligated to follow US  rules, it may be helpful  to explain to host-nations that US QD standards  are  enforced  on  US  installations,  and  are  based  on  testing,  experience,  and scientific analysis. 1.2.1.6.  With  the  exception  to  Tier-0  (T-0)  identified  requirements  that  cannot  be waived, Commanders will ensure all exceptions (i.e., deviations, event waivers, waivers, exemptions, and Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) waivers and exemptions for new construction) to this Manual are accomplished IAW Section 1B. (T-1).  All remaining waivers  and  deviations  will  be  submitted  IAW  AFI  33-360.    For  the  purposes  of  this instruction, the following definitions apply: 1.2.1.6.1.  “Shall”, “must”, and “will” indicates a mandatory requirement that must be waived/ deviated from IAW AFI 33-360.  “Will” is also used to express a declaration of purpose for a future event. 1.2.1.6.2.  “Should” accomplishment. 1.2.1.6.3.  “May” indicates an acceptable or suggested means of accomplishment. 1.2.1.6.4.  “Sign”  indicates  a  requirement  to  obtain  and  maintain  a  signature  by digital, electronic, or hard copy means. indicates  a  preferred,  but  not  mandatory,  method  of 1.2.1.7.  To  Air  Force  contract  personnel  (except  as  allowed  in  paragraph  1.2.1.3.) exposed to AE on Air Force installations.  Such personnel may be afforded the same level of  protection  that  would  be  similarly  provided  to  Air  Force  civilian  and  military 30 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 personnel.  The installation weapons safety office will notify the contracting officer, in writing, of explosives hazards to Air Force contract personnel. (T-1). 1.2.1.8.  To  the  siting  and  construction  of  Air  Force  facilities  (except  as  allowed  in paragraph 1.2.2.) Note:  For purposes of this Manual, the term “MAJCOM” includes, Major Commands, Field Operating Agencies (FOA), Direct Reporting Units (DRU), and Air Component Commands (e.g., US Air Forces Central (USAFCENT).   1.2.2.  Continue  to  use  existing  facilities  not  complying  with  these  standards  only  when current hazards are not greater than those assumed for their original use, and only provided installations can clearly demonstrate that redesign or modification is not feasible, and that the quantity  of  explosives,  propellants,  or  chemical  agents  cannot  be  reduced  for  reasons  of operational necessity. (T-1). 1.2.2.1.  To invoke this grandfathering clause for continued use of such facilities, have the following on file at the installation: (T-1). 1.2.2.1.1.  Date of construction, original purpose and quantity of explosives approved. 1.2.2.1.2.  Explosives safety criteria in effect at the time of construction. 1.2.2.1.3.  An explanation why redesign or modification is not feasible. 1.2.2.1.4.  An explanation why quantities cannot be reduced below existing levels. 1.2.2.1.5.  An explanation why current explosives safety criteria cannot be applied to the facility. 1.2.2.1.6.  A statement that risks are not greater than those assumed for the original siting. 1.2.2.1.7.  Written  approval  from  the  installation  Commander  and  the  Major Command’s  Chief  of  Safety  (MAJCOM/SE)  when  initially  invoking  grandfather clause. 1.2.2.2.  The installation Weapons Safety Manager (WSM) will review the information required in paragraph 1.2.2.1. at least every five years to see if mission changes allow the facility to be brought into compliance with current standards. (T-1).  If compliance with current standards is not possible and the facility is still being used for its original purpose and IAW its original criteria, then continue to maintain the documentation that was generated at the onset. (T-1).  The installation WSM will ensure documentation of the periodic review must be kept on file at the installation. (T-1). 1.2.2.3.  Resiting such facilities requires compliance with these standards unless guidance of paragraph 1.2.2. is met or an exception is obtained IAW Section 1B. (T-1). 1.2.3.  Evaluate non-DoD explosives siting submissions on DoD installations only to ensure compliance  with  DoD  explosives  safety  standards  to  non-commercial  (DoD  and  public) exposures (see paragraph 12.86.). (T-0). Section 1B—Exception Program 1.3.  General. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 31 1.3.1.  The AE safety standards herein are designed to manage the risks associated with AE by providing protection against serious injury, loss of life, and damage to property but are not intended to be so rigid as to prevent the Air Force from accomplishing its assigned missions.  Consequently, when exceptions from these standards are made, proper authority within the Air  Force  must  accept  the  added  risk  to  personnel  and  property  against  the  strategic  or compelling operational reasons that necessitate such exceptions.  Added risk to personnel and property must be analyzed and documented to include methods used to reduce the risk to a level acceptable to the Air Force approval authority. 1.3.2.  Ease  of  operation  or  convenience  is  not  an  acceptable  reason  for  requesting  an exception. 1.3.3.  This  section  implements  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  90-802,  Risk  Management,  by providing a mechanism for units to assess the level of risk involved with QD exceptions and by  providing  guidance  on  the  appropriate  approval  level  for  each  exception.    Make  this determination  after  a  complete  analysis  of  the  mission,  explosives  requirements,  and facilities. 1.3.4.  Outside  Continental  United  States  (OCONUS)  locations,  Commanders  will  ensure host-nation military and civilian personnel are provided the same level of protection as U.S. personnel. (T-1)  Commanders will ensure host-nation Commanders are notified when QD exceptions  to  Air  Force  standards  place  host-nation  personnel  at  additional  risk  beyond normal  QD  requirements.  (T-1).    If  required  by    Status  of  Forces  Agreements  (SOFA), basing,  or  other  international  agreements,  host-nation  approval  must  be  obtained.  (T-1).  Review of documents establishing US physical presence and/or activities should be reviewed to  identify  any  notice  or  approval  requirements.    See  paragraph  1.2.1.5.  for  additional guidance,  when  explosives  content  of  host-nation’s  facilities  may  be  hazarding  Air  Force facilities and personnel. 1.3.5.  Exceptions need  not be submitted when  compensatory measures  can be taken  (e.g., temporarily reducing the authorized net explosive weight for quantity-distance (NEWQD) of a  PES)  that  avoid  an  exception.    Document  as  prescribed  in  paragraphs  14.22.8.  and  14.23.12.  1.3.6.  Exceptions need not be submitted for situations that, upon analysis by Headquarters Air Force Safety Center/Weapons Safety Division (AFSEC/SEW) and the DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) are determined to provide the required degree of safety through use of protective construction or other specialized safety features. 1.3.7.  The  host  base  weapons  safety  offices  must  maintain  copies  of  current  waivers, exemptions, deviations, and compensatory measures. (T-1). 1.3.8.  Commanders will ensure operations or activities involving exceptions are not allowed until the exceptions are approved by the required approval authority. (T-1). 1.4.  Deviations. 1.4.1.  A  deviation  is  a  written  authority  permitting  exceptions  from  mandatory  non-QD requirements  of  this  Manual  for  strategic  or  compelling  operational  reasons.    Generally, Chapter 12 of this Manual contains QD requirements and all other Chapters contain non-QD requirements.    AFSEC/SEW  must  formally  approve  deviations  from  paragraph  5.23.4., 32 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 “Side  flash  Protection  for  Nuclear  Weapons”  or  AFI  91-208,  Hazards  of  Electromagnetic Radiation  to  Ordnance  (HERO)  Certification  and  Management,  for  “Modern  Mobile Emitters (MME)”.  (T-1). 1.4.1.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  deviation  requests  are  documented  as  required  in paragraph 1.4.3. below (T-1), with the following changes: 1.4.1.1.1.  For deviations from paragraph 5.23.4., there is an additional requirement for a detailed description of compensatory measures which have been developed and are in place.  The description must include the reduced value of side flash separation distance which will be observed. (T-1). 1.4.1.1.2.  For deviations from paragraph 5.23.4., modify the requirement for a risk assessment  (Chapter  4)  to  include  only  a  review  of  the  trade-offs  between  any expected  additional  risk  from  the  decreased  side  flash  separation  distance  and  any expected increased safety  due to the compensatory measures.  (T-1).  Develop on a case-by-case basis and in coordination with AFSEC/SEW, the requirements necessary to complete this assessment. (T-1). 1.4.1.1.3.  For deviations from HERO requirements, modify the requirement for a risk assessment  (Chapter  4)  to  include  only  a  detailed  technical  evaluation  of  the electromagnetic hazards and Electrically Initiated Device (EID) sensitivities involved, and a description of the operational need for the deviation. (T-1). 1.4.1.1.4.  For deviations from either paragraph, there is an additional requirement for a signed statement with the authority to accept any increased risk and acknowledge responsibility for any consequences resulting from performing operations under this deviation. 1.4.1.2.  AFSEC/SEW will forward copies of all approved deviations to MAJCOM/SEW. (T-1). 1.4.1.3.  MAJCOMs  determine  the  criteria  to  identify,  track  and  review  base  level deviations. 1.4.2.  MAJCOMs will determine and document approval levels for all other deviations. 1.4.3.  Document  deviations  using  a  memorandum  format  (T-1)  and  include  the  following information: 1.4.3.1.  Requirement of this Manual (cite specific reference) that is being excepted. 1.4.3.2.  Strategic or compelling operational reasons for requesting the deviation. 1.4.3.3.  Risk assessment IAW Chapter 4. 1.4.3.4.  Evaluation of feasible corrective actions and justification why none can currently be implemented (e.g., cost, mission impact). 1.4.3.5.  Pursue proposed corrective action or actions to ultimately correct the deviation.  Several corrective actions may be pursued at the same time.  For each corrective action being pursued provide associated cost estimate and schedule for completion. 1.4.3.6.  If no corrective actions are feasible to ultimately correct the deviation, so state and provide justification. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 33 1.4.3.7.  Expiration date, if appropriate. 1.4.4.  Commanders responsible for the deviation will ensure deviations are reviewed every three years IAW paragraph 1.13. (T-1). 1.5.  Event Waivers (Nonrecurring). 1.5.1.  Event waivers provide written authority to temporarily deviate from requirements of this  Manual  when  situations  occur  without  sufficient  time  to  comply  with  formal  site planning procedures.  Commanders will ensure formal DDESB site plan approval is obtained within 365 days from the date of waiver approval, if required. (T-1). 1.5.2.  Commanders  will  ensure  event  waivers  are  not  used  as  a  replacement  for  proper planning when formal explosives site planning approval can be obtained prior to the start of operations. (T-1). 1.5.3.  The responsible Commander must approve the event waiver in writing prior to onset of operations, or as soon as possible thereafter, for the length of the operational requirement but  not  to  exceed  365  days.  (T-1).    If  the  Air  Force  unit  is  a  tenant  on  a  non-Air  Force installation, process according to governing directives. 1.5.4.  The  responsible  Commander  will  ensure  event  waivers  are  documented  using  a memorandum format (T-1) and include, as applicable, the following information: 1.5.4.1.  Type and NEWQD of munitions involved. 1.5.4.2.  Type of ES.  If people are present, give an estimate of the number of civilians and military. 1.5.4.3.  Strategic or compelling operational reasons for approving the event waiver. 1.5.4.4.  Distance  required  versus  distance  available  and  QD  standard  not  met,  if applicable. 1.5.4.5.  Narrative  explanation  outlining  the  reason  or  reasons  why  the  explosive standards  could  not  be  met  and  a  discussion  of  reasonable  alternatives  considered  and rejected. 1.5.4.6.

A  waiver  is  a  written  authority  permitting  a  temporary  exception  for  existing construction, from a mandatory QD requirement of this Manual for strategic or compelling operational  reasons.    Generally,  waivers  are  granted  for  a  short  period  (5  years  or  less) pending  cancellation  or  correction  of  the  waived  conditions.    Waivers  are  not  granted  for periods exceeding 5 years. 1.6.2.  Waiver approval level is based on the level of the assessed risk.  The approval level is determined by application of the nomograph per paragraph 1.12. 1.6.3.  Comply with the information requirements listed in paragraph 1.10. (See paragraph 1.11. for HAF-level waivers). 1.6.4.  Forward waivers as part of the ESP package.  MAJCOMS will validate and submit Hybrid Safety Submissions (HSS)s to AFSEC/SEW for review and subsequent submission for final approval.  AFSEC/SEW will return packages failing to meet the test of strategic or compelling  operational  need,  or  packages  omitting  information  requirements  listed  in paragraph 1.10. or paragraph 1.11. for HAF-level waivers. 1.6.5.  Commanders responsible for the waiver will ensure a waiver is reviewed biennially on the  anniversary  of  their  approval  date.  (T-1).    See  paragraph  1.13.  for  review  process requirements. 1.7.  Exemptions. 1.7.1.  An  exemption  is  a  written  authority  permitting  a  long-term  (more  than  5  years) exception  from  a  mandatory  QD  requirement  of  this  Manual  for  strategic  or  compelling operational reasons. 1.7.2.  Exemption approval level is based on the level of risk assumed by the specific hazard.  The approval level is determined by application of the nomograph per paragraph 1.12. 1.7.3.  Comply with the information requirements listed in paragraph 1.10. or paragraph 1.11. for HAF-level exemptions. 1.7.4.  Forward exemptions as part of the ESP package.  MAJCOMs will validate and submit exemption HSSs to AFSEC/SEW for review and subsequent submission for final approval.  AFSEC/SEW  will  return  packages  failing  to  meet  the  test  of  strategic  or  compelling operational need, or packages omitting information requirements listed in paragraph 1.10. or paragraph 1.11. for HAF-level exemptions. 1.7.5.  Commanders  responsible  for  the  exemption  will  ensure  exemptions  are  reviewed every 5 years on the anniversary of the approval date. (T-1).  Reviews may be accomplished early to spread out workloads.  See paragraph 1.13. for review requirements. 1.8.  SECAF New Construction Exemption. 1.8.1.  SECAF waivers and exemptions are written authorities that permit an exception, for new PES or ES construction, from a mandatory QD requirement of this Manual for strategic or  compelling  operational  reasons.    This  paragraph  applies  to  SECAF  waivers  and exemptions for new construction at enduring locations. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 35 1.8.2.  SECAF  must  approve  all  planned  construction  at  enduring  locations  or  MILCON funded projects at non-enduring locations not meeting QD standards. 1.8.3.  Comply with the information requirements listed in paragraph 1.11. 1.8.4.  Forward  SECAF  waivers  and  exemptions  as  part  of  the  ESP  package.    MAJCOMs will  validate  and  submit  SECAF  new  construction  exemption  HSSs  to  AFSEC/SEW  for review  and  subsequent  submission  for  final  approval.    AFSEC/SEW  will  return  packages failing  to  meet  the  test  of  strategic  or  compelling  operational  need,  or  packages  omitting information requirements listed in paragraph 1.11 (T-1). 1.8.5.  See paragraph 1.13. for review process requirements. 1.8.6.  Commanders  will  ensure construction are assessed and approved IAW paragraph 1.12.

Non-DoD  explosives  activities,  that  are  non-compliant  with  the  explosives  safety standards  in  this  Manual  and  do  not  hazard  DoD  activities  or  violate  QD  criteria  to  DoD activities, will not be processed as exceptions. (T-1). 1.9.2.  Instead, ESP packages involving such non-compliant, non-DoD explosives activities will (T-1): 1.9.2.1.  Clearly  specify  situations  where  non-compliance  with  explosives  safety requirements exists. 1.9.2.2.  Include a risk acknowledgement letter signed by the non-DoD user. 1.9.2.3.  Include installation’s weapons safety office recommendation for ESP approval or disapproval with supporting rationale and installation Commander coordination. 1.9.3.  Coordinate  with  the  non-DoD  user  prior  to  higher  headquarters  submission  of  the ESP. 1.10.  Waiver and Exemption Information Requirements. 1.10.1.  Preparation of waivers and exemptions is a team effort involving installation safety, civil engineering, legal, and other agencies affected by the waiver or exemption.  Involve all supporting  and  affected  agencies  to  ensure  thorough  evaluation  of  the  proposed  waiver  or exemption. 1.10.2.  Identify  waivers  and  exemptions  for  each  individual  PES  to  ES  relationship  not meeting the QD requirements of this Manual. 1.10.3.  For  each  excepted  PES  to  ES  pair,  submit  the  following  information  in  the  ESP package (T-1) (Attachment 3 contains a sample narrative of a QD exception request): 1.10.3.1.  Waiver or exemption number. 1.10.3.2.  Requirement from this Manual (cite specific reference) that is being excepted. 1.10.3.3.

Proposed  corrective  action  or  actions  to  ultimately  correct  the  waiver  or exemption.    Several  corrective  actions,  any  one  of  which  may  correct  the  waiver  or exemption, may be pursued at the same time.  For each corrective action being pursued provide  associated  cost  estimate  and  schedule  for  completion.    Installation  safety  staff will keep copies of supporting documentation for corrective actions being pursued. (T-1). 1.10.3.8.  If  no  corrective  actions  are  feasible  to  ultimately  correct  the  waiver  or exemption, so state and provide justification. 1.10.3.9.  Expiration date, if appropriate. 1.10.4.  See  paragraph  14.22.6.  for  identifying  waivers  and  exemptions  on  the  AF  Form 943, Explosives Site Plan, or Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) Submittal Form. 1.10.5.  If the waiver or exemption decision nomograph (paragraph 1.12.) requires Assistant Secretary of the Air Force, SAF/Installations, Environment and Logistics (SAF/IE) approval, comply with the information requirements in paragraph 1.11. 1.11.  HAF-Level Waiver and Exemption Information Requirements. 1.11.1.  This paragraph applies to all waivers and exemptions requiring SECAF or SAF/IE approval.  To expedite processing of HSSs with waivers or exemptions through Air Staff and Secretariat  offices,  a  standardized  format  is  essential.    Units  or  MAJCOMs  seeking  HAF-level  approval  for  waivers  and  exemptions  will  submit  all  required information electronically.  Provide all HSS information required in Chapter 14, even though it may not all  be  included  in  the  package  forwarded  to  HAF-level.    Assemble  HAF-level  request packages  using  the  following  format  (AFSEC/SEW  may  modify  the  tab  format  to accommodate SECAF approval and/or SAF/IE risk acceptance memorandum(s)): 1.11.2.  Tab  1.  MAJCOM/CC  or  CV  Memorandum.    Use  the  transmittal  letter  in Attachment 2 as a format for this memorandum. 1.11.3.  Tab 2.  Maps.  Provide the map for the ESP according to paragraph 14.24.   1.11.4.  Tab  3.  AF  Form  943  or  Explosive  Safety  Siting  Submittal  Form.    Clearly  show siting  pairs  without  exceptions,  exceptions  requiring  HAF-level  approval,  and  exceptions having  received  approval  at  subordinate  levels  of  command  (see  paragraph  14.23.  for specific guidance). 1.11.5.  Tab 4.  The Specific Standard Not Met.  Identify and cite the specific reference in this Manual requiring the exemption or waiver.  Provide sufficient information to explain the nature of the exemption or waiver.  Use highlighted excerpts from this Manual to explain the type  of  separation  required  (e.g.,  inhabited  building  distance  (IBD)  or  public  traffic  route distances  (PTRD))  and  the  distance  required  or  how  the  distance  is  calculated  (e.g.,  QD distance criteria table, fragment distance criteria, etc.). 1.11.6.  Tab  5.  Justification.    In  narrative  form,  provide  a  detailed  explanation  of  the “strategic  or  compelling  operational”  reason  for  requesting  the  HAF-level  waiver  or exemption.  Use specific references to aircraft sortie rates or other pertinent data to justify the AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 37 type,  quantity,  and  placement  of  explosives  at  the  PES.    Additionally,  fully  justify  the position of the excepted ES.  Provide any additional information, such as higher headquarters inspection  findings  or  limiting  factors  (LIMFAC)  to  substantiate  the  request.    Identify  all feasible  corrective  actions  and  justify  why  none  can  currently  be  implemented  (e.g.,  cost, mission impact). 1.11.7.  Tab  6.  Risk  Assessment.    Provide  a  risk  assessment  IAW  Chapter  4.    Provide  a separate  waiver  or  exemption  decision  nomograph  for  each  excepted  PES  to  ES  pair requiring HAF-level approval (see paragraph 1.12.). 1.11.8.  Tab 7.  Corrective Actions.  Discuss any and all actions taken or planned to mitigate the  effects  of  an  explosives  mishap.    Consider  such  things  as  building  techniques, barricading,  glass  protection,  tiered  siting,  or  planned  construction.    Identify  the  proposed specific corrective action or actions to ultimately correct the waiver or exemption.  Several corrective actions, any one of which may correct the waiver or exemption, may be pursued at the same time.  For each corrective action being pursued provide associated cost estimate and schedule  for  completion.    (Installation  safety  staff  will  keep  copies  of  supporting documentation for corrective actions being pursued.)  If no corrective actions are feasible to ultimately correct the waiver or exemption, so state and provide justification. 1.11.9.  Tab  8.  Options.    Discuss  fully  all  reasonable  options  considered  by  the  unit  but rejected in favor of the proposed action.  Give details as to why each of the other options was not chosen.  Discuss limitations to funding, real estate, or other constraints, as appropriate. 1.12.  Waiver and Exemption Decision Nomograph. 1.12.1.  The waiver and exemption decision nomograph is a tool to assess risk and determine the  appropriate  authority  level  for  acceptance  of  risk  at  all  locations  for  exceptions  from mandatory QD requirements. 1.12.2.  Enduring  Location  Approval  Levels for  Peacetime/Armistice  Operations.  Consequence-based  approval  levels  for  enduring  locations  during  peacetime/armistice operations range from SAF/IE down to Numbered Air Force (NAF) Commander level.  The following  are  the  required  approval  levels  for  each  risk  assessment  level  as  specified  in Figure 1.1.   1.12.2.1.  Extremely High, SAF/IE.  MAJCOM/CC or CV may accept risk at this level for temporary QD departures to construction workers (see paragraph 1.8.6.). 1.12.2.2.  High, MAJCOM/CC or CV. 1.12.2.3.  Medium, NAF/CC or CV.  Where NAFs do not exist, MAJCOMs will identify an  alternate  intermediate  command  level  between  wing  and  MAJCOM;  if  there  is  no intermediate command level, MAJCOM approval is required in place of NAF. 1.12.2.4.  Low,  NAF/CC  or  CV.    The  NAF/CC  or  CV  may  delegate  this  level  of  risk acceptance to the Wing Commander.  In the event a NAF does not exist, MAJCOM may delegate this level of risk acceptance. for  Wartime/Contingency  Operations.  1.12.3.  Enduring  Location  Approval  Levels Consequence-based  approval  levels  for  enduring  locations  during  wartime/contingency operations range from MAJCOM/CC or CV down to NAF command level.  The following are the required approval levels for each risk assessment level as specified in Figure 1.2. 38 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 1.12.3.1.  Extremely High and High, MAJCOM/CC or CV. 1.12.3.2.  Medium, NAF/CC or CV.  Where NAFs do not exist, MAJCOMs will identify an  alternate  intermediate  command  level  between  wing  and  MAJCOM;  if  there  is  no intermediate command level, MAJCOM approval is required in place of NAF. 1.12.3.3.  Low,  NAF/CC  or  CV.    The  NAF/CC  or  CV  may  delegate  this  level  of  risk acceptance to the Wing Commander.  In the event a NAF does not exist, MAJCOM may delegate this level of risk acceptance. 1.12.4.  Elevation  Authority.    USAF/SE  may  elevate  any  QD  exception  for  enduring locations to the Air Force Chief of Staff for final approval or informational purposes. 1.12.5.  Non-Enduring Location Approval Levels.  The Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC)  will  determine  consequence-based  approval  levels  for  non-enduring  locations  IAW CJCSI 4360.01A, Explosives Safety and Munitions Risk Management for Joint Operations Planning, Training, and Execution, and Chapter 13 of this Manual. Note:  The GCC may authorize the application of CJCSI 4360.01A for enduring locations under their command. 1.12.6.  The nomograph is a two-step process.  First, conduct a risk assessment to categorize the level of risk.  Then plot the criteria on the nomograph and determine the approval level. 1.12.6.1.  Risk Assessment.  Risk levels are calculated based on three criteria: 1.12.6.1.1.  Likelihood.    The  likelihood  of  a  mishap  is  the  relative  probability  an explosives mishap may occur based on the type of explosives involved, the level of activity  at  the  PES,  and  external  threats  to  the  location.    Each  excepted  PES  is categorized  according  to  one  of  the  five  likelihood  levels  identified  in  Table  1.1.  Contact  AFSEC/SEW  when  Table  1.1.  fails  to  describe  explosive  operations  or locations adequately. 1.12.6.1.2.  Exposure.  Exposure is the amount of time personnel and resources at an ES are exposed to a PES.  It is expressed as man-hours per year.  Use Table 1.2. to categorize each excepted ES. 1.12.6.1.3.  Severity.  The possible severity of an explosives mishap is based on the worst-case type and amount of explosives present, the construction of both the PES and ES, and the distance between the PES and ES.  Information in Chapter 2 is used to estimate the potential damage and injuries from a mishap explosion.  Severity is categorized based on the effect on personnel, mission capability, and other resources according to Table 1.3. 1.12.6.2.  Plotting the Nomograph.  Each exception pair has three data points as defined in  paragraph  1.12.5.1.    Plot  each  data  point  on  the  applicable  nomograph.    Draw  a straight  line  from  the  Likelihood  point  through  the  Exposure  point  to  the  Pivot  Line.  From this point on the Pivot Line, draw a straight line through the Severity point to the Risk Assessment Level line. 1.13.  Periodic Reviews for Exceptions. 1.13.1.  Commanders will ensure periodic reviews of exceptions are documented (T-1), and include the following: AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 39 1.13.1.1.  Confirmation of the continued existence of the exception. 1.13.1.2.  Verification of the accuracy of the previous data associated with the exception. 1.13.1.3.  Validation of the strategic or compelling operational reasons for initial approval of the exception. 1.13.1.4.  Validation that mitigating actions and stipulations are still in force. 1.13.1.5.  Reassessment of proposed corrective actions.  Identify any changes to proposed corrective actions and the reasons for those changes. 1.13.1.6.  Current cost estimates for proposed corrective actions, if available. 1.13.1.7.  Status of progress towards accomplishing corrective actions and eliminating the exception. 1.13.1.8.  Estimated date and schedule for completion of corrective actions. 1.13.2.  Submit  copies  of  periodic  review  documentation  through  command  channels  to AFSEC/SEW. (T-1). 1.13.3.  Use  the  periodic  review  documentation  to  advocate  funding,  and  other  support required, for corrective action implementation. 1.13.4.  Approval Levels for Reviews. 1.13.4.1.  Reviews  of  deviations  from  paragraph  5.23.4.  “Side  Flash  Protection  for Nuclear Weapons” or AFI 91-208 for “Modern Mobile Emitters (MME)” and any or all of its paragraphs, must be formally approved by AFSEC/SEW. (T-1). 1.13.4.2.  MAJCOMs will determine and document approval levels for periodic review of all other deviations. 1.13.4.3.  Commanders  will  ensure  waivers  or  exemptions  are  reviewed  at  the  original approval level. (T-1).  However, if PES to ES data has changed, reapply the nomograph to determine the approval level. 1.13.4.4.  When completion of the corrective actions associated with a waiver exceeds 5 years, the next higher approval level must reissue a new waiver (unless last approved by SAF/IE).     (T-1). 1.13.5.  Cancellation of Waivers and Exemptions.  Units will notify MAJCOM’s who will in turn  notify  AFSEC/SEW  of  waivers  and  exemptions  no  longer  needed  according  to procedures outlined in MAJCOM supplements. (T-1). 40 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Figure 1.1.  Waiver and Exemption Decision Nomograph-Peacetime/Armistice Operations.  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 41 Figure 1.2.

Blast. 2.1.1.  Blast Wave Phenomena.  In an incident involving HD 1.1, or HD 1.1 with any other HD (an HD 1.1 event), the violent release of energy creates a sudden and intense pressure disturbance  termed  the  “blast  wave.”    The  blast  wave  is  characterized  by  an  almost instantaneous  rise  from  ambient  pressure  to  a  peak  incident  pressure  (Pi).    This  pressure increase,  or  “shock  front,”  travels  radially  outward  from  the  detonation  point,  with  a diminishing  velocity  that  is  always  in  excess  of  the  speed  of  sound  in  that  medium.    Gas molecules making up the front move at lower velocities.  This velocity, called the “particle velocity,”  is  associated  with  the  “dynamic  pressure,”  or  the  pressure  formed  by  the  winds produced by the shock front. 2.1.1.1.  As the shock front expands into increasingly larger volumes of the medium, the incident pressure decreases and, generally, the duration of the pressure-pulse increases. 2.1.1.2.  If the shock wave impinges a rigid surface (e.g., a building) at an angle to the direction  of  the  wave’s  propagation,  a  reflected  pressure  is  instantly  developed  on  the surface  and  this  pressure  rises  to  a  value  that  exceeds  the  incident  pressure.    This reflected  pressure  is  a  function  of  the  incident  wave’s  pressure  and  the  angle  formed between the rigid surface and the plane of the shock front. 2.1.2.  Partially Confined Explosions.  When an explosion occurs within a structure, the peak pressure associated with the initial shock front will both be high and amplified by reflections within  the  structure.    In  addition,  the  accumulation  of  gases  from  the  explosion  exerts additional  pressure  and  increases  the  load  duration  within  the  structure.    This  effect  may damage or destroy the structure unless the structure is designed to either withstand or vent the gas and shock pressures.  Structures that have one or more strengthened walls may be vented for relief of excessive gas by either frangible construction of the remaining walls or roof  or  through  the  use  of  openings.    This  type  of  construction  permits  the  gas  from  an internal  explosion  to  spill  out  of  the  structure.    Once  released  from  confinement,  these pressures (referred to as “exterior” or “leakage” pressures) expand radially and may affect external structures or personnel. 2.1.3.  QD K-factors.  Throughout this Manual, NEWQD is used to calculate QD separations for blast protection by means of a formula using a “K-factor.”  See paragraph 12.11. for explanation of this formula. 2.1.4.  Expected Blast Pressures at Table 2.1. presents the peak incident pressures that would be  expected  at  various  K-factors  from  HD  1.1  events.    Pressures  may  also  be  determined using the Incident Airblast Calculator and the Blast Effects Computer (BEC). 2.1.5.  General Blast Effects On Structures. 48 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 2.1.5.1.  Conventional  Structures.    Conventional  structures  are  generally  designed  to withstand roof-snow loads of 0-50 pounds per square foot or wind loads up to 90 miles per hour (mph), or both.  At 90 mph, the wind load equates to 0.14 pounds per square inch  (psi).    Given  the  pressures  shown  in  Table  2.1.  for  the  selected  K-factors,  it  is evident that, even at IBD, conventional structures may not provide complete protection from  blast.    Generally,  the  weakest  portions  of  any  conventional  structure  are  the windows.  Table 2.2. provides the probability of breaking typical windows at various K-factors and associated incident pressures from HD 1.1 events. 2.1.5.2.  Aboveground  Structures  (AGS).    These  are  generally  considered  conventional structures and provide little protection from blast or fragmentation (see paragraph 2.5.). 2.1.5.3.  Earth-Covered  Magazine  (ECM).    An  explosion  at  an  ECM  produces  high reflected  pressure  and  impulse.    These  can  damage  doors  and  headwalls  of  adjacent ECMs,  propelling  debris  onto  contents  and  communicating  the  explosion.    When separated  from  each  other  by  the  minimum  distances  required  by  Table  12.1.,  ECMs provide  AE  with  virtually  complete  protection  against  propagation  (see  Section  6C).  However, AE in adjacent ECMs may be damaged and structural damage ranging from cracks  in  concrete,  damage  to  ventilators  and  doors  to  complete  structural  failure  may occur in the corresponding ECM. Note:  When ECMs containing HD 1.1 AE are sited so that if anyone is in the forward sector of another, separate the two by distances greater than the minimum permitted for side-to-side orientations.  The greater distances are necessary to protect the door and headwall of a facing ECM from the adjacent explosion; to a lesser extent, they are necessary as protection from the directional effects of the source.  2.1.5.4.  Underground Storage Facilities.  Underground facilities sited per DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 5, provide a high degree of protection against propagation of an explosion between chambers, and between underground and aboveground structures.  An HD 1.1 explosion  in  an  underground  storage  facility  causes  very  high  pressures  of  prolonged duration.    Blast  waves  and  the  accompanying  gas  flows  travel  throughout  the underground facility at high velocity. 2.1.5.5.  Barricaded Open-Storage Modules.  Barricaded open-storage modules provide a high  degree  of  protection  against  the  propagation  of  an  explosion  (see  Section  6D).  However, if flammable materials are present in nearby cells, subsequent propagation by fire is possible.  When an explosion occurs in adjacent modules separated by K1.1, AE will be thrown tens of yards and be covered with earth, thereby unavailable for use until extensive  uncovering  operations,  and  possibly  maintenance,  are  completed.    Items  at K=2.5 separation distance from a donor explosion are expected to be readily accessible. 2.1.6.  General Blast Effects on Personnel.  Tables 2.3.,  2.4. and  2.5. describe the expected effects of blast on personnel. 2.1.7.  Computation of Blast Effects.  Many of the blast effects described in this section were computed at http://www.ddesb.pentagon.mil) and proven test methodologies as outlined in Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) Technical Paper (TP) 16, Methodologies for Calculating Primary Fragment Characteristics, current revision.  The DDESB Blast Effects the  DDESB Computer using Blast Effects (available AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 49 Computer  can  be  used  to  estimate  similar  effects  associated  with  various  NEWQDs, facilities, and distances. 2.2.  Fragments. 2.2.1.  An important consideration in the analysis of the hazards associated with an explosion is  the  effect  of  any  fragments  produced.    Although  most  common  in  HD  1.1  or  HD  1.2 events, fragmentation may occur in any incident involving AE (see Section 2B).  Depending on their origin, fragments are referred to as “primary” or “secondary” fragments. 2.2.2.  Primary fragments result from the shattering of a container (e.g., shell casings, kettles, hoppers, and other containers used in the manufacture of explosives, rocket engine housings) in  direct  contact  with  the  explosive.    These  fragments  usually  are  small,  initially  travel  at thousands of feet per second and may be lethal at long distances from an explosion. 2.2.3.  Secondary fragments are debris from structures and other items in close proximity to the explosion.  These fragments, which are somewhat larger in size than primary fragments and initially travel at hundreds of feet per second, do not normally travel as far as primary fragments. 2.2.4.  The earth cover of an underground facility may rupture and create a significant debris hazard. 2.2.5.  A hazardous fragment is one having an impact energy of 58 ft-lb or greater. 2.2.6.  A hazardous fragment density is one hazardous fragment per 600 ft2. 2.3.  Thermal Hazards. 2.3.1.  General.  Generally, thermal hazards from an HD 1.1 event are less hazardous than blast and fragment hazards. 2.3.2.  Personnel.    It  normally  takes  longer  to  incur  injury  from  thermal  effects  than  from either  blast  or  fragmentation  effects  because  both  blast  and  fragmentation  occur  almost instantaneously.  The time available to react to a thermal event increases survivability. 2.3.3.  Structures, Material, and AE.  The primary thermal effect on structures, material, and AE is their partial or total destruction by fire.  The primary concern with a fire involving AE is that it may transition to a more severe reaction, such as a detonation. 2.4.  Groundshock and Cratering. 2.4.1.  In an airburst, there may be a downward propagation of groundshock.  Cratering may be reduced or eliminated. 2.4.2.  In a surface burst, ground shock is generated and cratering can be significant. 2.4.3.  A buried or partially buried detonation produces the strongest ground shock; however, if the explosion is deep enough, no crater will be formed. 2.4.4.  Underground Facilities.  AE protection can be achieved by proper chamber spacing.  An HD 1.1 explosion will produce ground shocks that may rupture the earth cover and eject debris (See DoD 6055.09-M). 2.5.  Expected Consequences. 2.5.1.  Barricaded Aboveground Magazine (AGM) Distance – K6 (27 psi).  At this distance: 50 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 2.5.1.1.  Unstrengthened buildings will be destroyed. 2.5.1.2.  Personnel will be killed by blast, by being struck by debris, or by impact against hard surfaces. 2.5.1.3.  Transport vehicles will be overturned and crushed by the blast. 2.5.1.4.  Explosives-loaded  vessels  will  be  damaged  severely,  with  propagation  of explosion likely. 2.5.1.5.  Aircraft will be destroyed by blast, thermal, and debris effects. 2.5.1.6.  Barricades  are  an  effective  control  measure  for  preventing  simultaneous detonation of explosion by high velocity low angle fragments.  However, they provide only limited protection against any propagation of explosives caused by a fire resulting from high angle firebrands. 2.5.2.  Barricaded ILD – K9 (12 psi).  At this distance: 2.5.2.1.  Unstrengthened buildings will suffer severe structural damage approaching total destruction. 2.5.2.2.  Personnel will be subject to severe injuries or death from direct blast, building collapse, or translation. 2.5.2.3.  Aircraft will be damaged beyond economical repair both by blast and fragments.  If  aircraft  are  loaded  with  explosives,  delayed  explosions  are  likely  to  result  from subsequent fires. 2.5.2.4.  Transport vehicles will be damaged heavily, probably to the extent of total loss. 2.5.2.5.  Improperly  designed  barricades  or  structures  may  increase  the  hazard  from flying debris, or may collapse in such a manner as to increase the risk to personnel and equipment. 2.5.2.6.  Barricading  is  a  required  control  measure.    Direct  propagation  of  explosion between two explosive locations is unlikely when barricades are placed between them to intercept high velocity low angle fragments.  Exposed structures containing high value, mission critical equipment or personnel may require hardening. 2.5.3.  Unbarricaded Aboveground Magazine Distance – K11 (8 psi).  At this distance: 2.5.3.1.  Unstrengthened buildings will suffer damage approaching total destruction. 2.5.3.2.  Personnel are likely to be injured seriously due to blast, fragments, debris, and translation. 2.5.3.3.  There is a 15 percent risk of eardrum rupture. 2.5.3.4.  Explosives-loaded vessels are likely to be damaged extensively and propagation of explosion may occur. 2.5.3.5.  Aircraft  will  be  damaged  heavily  by  blast  and  fragments;  destruction  by resulting fire is likely. 2.5.3.6.  Transport vehicles will sustain severe body damage, minor engine damage, and total glass breakage. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 51 2.5.3.7.  As  a  control,  barricading  will  significantly  reduce  the  risk  of  propagation  of explosion and injury of personnel by high velocity low angle fragments. 2.5.4.  Unbarricaded ILD – K18 (3.5 psi).  At this distance: 2.5.4.1.  Direct propagation of explosion is not expected. 2.5.4.2.  Propagation of an explosion may occur at the ES, as either a direct result of a fire or as a result of equipment failure. 2.5.4.3.  Damage to unstrengthened buildings may approximate 50 percent, or more, of the  total  replacement  cost.    Sensitive  electronic  equipment  is  expected  to  stop functioning. 2.5.4.4.  There is a two percent chance of eardrum damage to personnel. 2.5.4.5.  Personnel may suffer serious injuries from fragments, debris, firebrands, or other objects. 2.5.4.6.  Fragments  could  damage  the  decks  and  superstructure  of  cargo  ships  and overpressure could buckle their doors and bulkheads on weather decks. 2.5.4.7.  Aircraft  can  be  expected  to  suffer  considerable  structural  damage  from  blast.  Fragments and debris are likely to cause severe damage to aircraft at K18 distances when small quantities of explosives are involved. 2.5.4.8.  Transport vehicles will incur extensive, but not severe, body and glass damage consisting mainly of dishing of body panels and cracks in shatter-resistant window glass. 2.5.4.9.  Suitably designed suppressive construction at PES or protective construction at ES may be practical controls for some situations.  Such construction is encouraged when there is insufficient distance to provide the required protection. 2.5.5.  PTRD (under 100,000 lbs High Explosives (HE)) – K24 (2.3 psi).  At this distance: 2.5.5.1.  Unstrengthened buildings can be expected to sustain damage approximately 20 percent of the replacement cost. 2.5.5.2.  Occupants  of  exposed  structures  may  suffer  temporary  hearing  loss  or  injury from blast effects, building debris and displacement. 2.5.5.3.  Although personnel in the open are not expected to be killed or seriously injured by  blast  effects,  fragments  and  debris  may  cause  some  injuries.    The  extent  of  these injuries  depends  largely  upon  the  PES  structure  and  the  amount  and  fragmentation characteristics of the AE involved. 2.5.5.4.  Vehicles on the road may suffer little damage, unless they are hit by a fragment or the blast causes a momentary loss of control. 2.5.5.5.  Aircraft  may  suffer  some  damage  to  the  fuselage  from  blast  and  possible fragment penetration, but should be operational with minor repair. 2.5.5.6.  Cargo-type  ships  should  suffer  minor  damage  to  deck  structure  and  exposed electronics  from  blast  and  possible  fragment  penetration,  but  such  damage  should  be readily repairable. 52 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 2.5.5.7.  Barricading is an effective control that can reduce the risk of injury or damage due to fragments for limited quantities of AE at a PES.  When practical, suitably designed suppressive construction at the PES or protective construction at the ES may also provide some protection. 2.5.6.  PTRD (over 250,000 lbs HE) – K30 (1.7 psi).  At this distance: 2.5.6.1.  Unstrengthened  buildings  can  be  expected  to  sustain  damage  that  may approximate ten percent of their replacement cost. 2.5.6.2.  Occupants of exposed, unstrengthened structures may be injured by secondary blast effects, such as falling building debris. 2.5.6.3.  Pilots of aircraft that are landing or taking off may lose control and crash. 2.5.6.4.  Parked military and commercial aircraft will likely sustain minor damage due to blast, but should remain airworthy. 2.5.6.5.  Although personnel in the open are not expected to be killed or seriously injured by  blast  effects,  fragments  and  debris  may  cause  some  injuries.    The  extent  of  these injuries will largely depend upon the PES structure, the NEWQD, and the fragmentation characteristics of the AE involved. 2.5.6.6.  Barricading or the application of minimum fragmentation distance requirements are effective controls that may reduce the risk of injury or damage due to fragments for limited quantities of AE at a PES. 2.5.7.  IBD – K40 to K50 (1.2 psi to 0.9 psi).  At this distance: 2.5.7.1.  Unstrengthened buildings can be expected to sustain damage that approximates 5- percent of their replacement cost. 2.5.7.2.  Personnel in buildings are provided a high degree of protection from death or serious injury; however, glass breakage and building debris may still cause some injuries. 2.5.7.3.  Personnel in the open are not expected to be injured seriously by blast effects.  Fragments and debris may cause some injuries.  The extent of injuries will depend upon the PES structure and the NEWQD and fragmentation characteristics of the AE involved. 2.5.7.4.  Elimination of glass surfaces is the best control.  If determined to be necessary, reducing the use of glass or the size of any glass surfaces and the use of blast resistant glass will provide some relief.  For new construction, building design characteristics, to include  consideration  of  how  any  required  glass  surfaces  are  oriented  and  use  of  blast resistant glass, can reduce glass breakage and structural damage. Section 2B—Principal Effects of HD  1.2 Events 2.6.  Blast. 2.6.1.  HD 1.2, when not stored with HD 1.1 or HD 1.5, is not expected to mass detonate.  In an incident involving HD 1.2, when stored by itself or with HD 1.3, HD 1.4, or HD 1.6 (a HD 1.2 event), AE can be expected to both explode sporadically and burn.  Fire propagates through the mass of the AE over time.  Some AE may neither explode nor burn.  Blast effects AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 53 from  the  incident  are  limited  to  the  immediate  vicinity  and  are  not  considered  to  be  a significant hazard. 2.6.2.  A  HD  1.2  event  may  occur  over  a  prolonged  period  of  time.    Generally,  the  first reactions are relatively nonviolent and, typically, begin a few minutes after flames engulf the AE.  Later reactions tend to be more violent.  Reactions can continue for some time (hours), even after a fire is effectively out.  Generally, smaller AE tends to react earlier in an incident than larger AE. 2.6.3.  The results of an accidental explosion in an underground facility depend on the type and  quantity  of  munitions,  the  type  of  explosion  produced,  and  the  layout  of  the  facility.  Hazards  created  outside  the  underground  facility  are  not  likely  to  be  as  severe  as  those produced by HD 1.1 or 1.3 material. 2.7.  Fragments. 2.7.1.  The  primary  hazard  from  a  HD  1.2  event  is  fragmentation.    Fragmentation  may include  primary  fragments  from  AE  casings  or  secondary  fragments  from  containers  and structures.    At  longer  ranges,  primary  fragments  are  the  major  contributors  to  fragment hazards. 2.7.2.  During  a  HD  1.2  event,  fragmentation  may  extensively  damage  exposed  facilities.  However, less fragmentation damage can be expected from a given quantity of HD 1.2 than would be expected from the corresponding quantity of HD 1.1 because not all the HD 1.2 reacts. 2.8.  Thermal Hazards. 2.8.1.  An  incident  involving  a  quantity  of  HD  1.2  poses  considerably  less  thermal  risk  to personnel than  an incident involving corresponding quantities of either  HD 1.1 or HD 1.3 because a HD 1.2 event’s progressive nature allows personnel to immediately evacuate the area. 2.8.2.  A HD 1.2 event’s progressive nature provides an opportunity  for  a fire suppression system, if installed, to put out a fire in its early stages. 2.8.3.  Ejected  Items.    In  HD  1.2  events,  a  reaction  may  eject  (lob)  unreacted-AE  or  AE components from the event site.  These ejected items may subsequently react. 2.8.4.  Propelled  Items.    In  HD  1.2  events,  some  AE  or  AE  components  may  become propulsive and travel well beyond IBD. 2.8.5.  Firebrands.  In an incident involving only HD 1.2 or HD 1.2 with HD 1.4, firebrands are considered to be a hazard only in the immediate vicinity of the incident site. 2.9.  Expected Consequences. 2.9.1.  The  expected  consequences  for  HD  1.2  AE  are  similar  to  those  for  HD  1.1.    The effects of HD 1.2 AE are NEWQD dependent. 2.9.2.  The principal hazard to personnel in the open, to aircraft, and to occupied vehicles is fragments. 54 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 2.9.3.  Airblast, fragment, and thermal hazards to buildings and parked aircraft or vehicles cannot  be  predicted  reliably  because  the  effects  depend  on  the  maximum  credible  event (MCE). Section 2C—Principal Effects of HD  1.3 Events 2.10.  Gas Pressures. 2.10.1.  In an incident involving only HD 1.3 or HD 1.3 with HD 1.4 (a HD 1.3 event): 2.10.1.1.  Where sufficient venting is provided, gas pressures generated by the event are not a significant concern.  Examples of sites with sufficient venting include open storage and structures where internal pressures do not exceed one to two psi (non-confinement structure). 2.10.1.2.  Where  venting  is  insufficient,  internal  gas  pressures  may  be  substantial.    In such situations, these pressures may blow out vent panels or frangible walls and, in some instances, cause partial or complete structural failure. 2.10.1.3.  Where is  minimal  venting  and  structural  containment  (extreme confinement), a detonation of a HD 1.3 item may occur with effects similar to those of an HD 1.1 explosion (e.g., HD 1.3 AE is considered as HD 1.1 (mass explosion) for QD purposes when stored in underground chambers). there 2.11.  Fragments. 2.11.1.  In a HD 1.3 event, fragments are considerably less hazardous than those produced by HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 events. 2.11.2.  Internal gas pressures may produce fragments from the bursting of containers or the rupture of containment facilities.  In general, such fragments are large and of low velocity.  For exceptions, see paragraph 2.13.3. 2.12.  Thermal Hazards. 2.12.1.  In a HD 1.3 event, heat flux presents the greatest hazard to personnel and assets.  HD 1.3 substances include both fuel components and oxidizers.  Burning HD 1.3 emits fuel-rich flammable gases, fine particles, or both.  This unburned material may ignite when it comes in contact with air and cause a large fireball.  This fireball expands radially from the ignition site and could wrap around obstacles, even those designed to provide line-of-sight protection from HD 1.1 events.  Shields and walls can be designed to provide protection from thermal effects (see paragraph 4.19.). 2.12.2.  The nominal spherical fireball that would be expected from the rapid burning of HD 1/3 where DFIRE is the diameter of the fireball in 1.3 can be calculated by DFIRE = 10 x WEFFfeet and WEFF is the quantity of HD 1.3 involved (lb), multiplied by a 20 percent safety factor (e.g., W of 100 lbs = WEFF of 120 lbs). 2.12.3.  In addition to the fireball itself, the thermal flux from the fireball can ignite fires out to intermagazine distance (IMD). 2.12.4.  Propelled  Items.    In  a  HD  1.3  event,  some  AE  or  AE  components  may  become propulsive and travel well beyond IBD. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 55 2.12.5.  Firebrands.    In  a  HD  1.3  event,  a  severe  fire-spread  hazard  may  result  from firebrands projected from the incident site.  Firebrands can be expected to be thrown more than 50 feet from a HD 1.3 event.  Firebrands  can ignite fires well beyond the distance a fireball poses a threat. 2.13.  Expected Consequences. 2.13.1.  Exposed personnel may receive severe burns from fireballs or flash burning in a HD 1.3 event.  The hazard distance is dependent on the quantity and burning rate of the HD 1.3 involved. 2.13.2.  Buildings, vehicles, and aircraft may be ignited by radiant heat, sparks, or firebrands or may be damaged by heat (searing, buckling, etc.). 2.13.3.  Personnel in nearby buildings, vehicles, or aircraft may be injured unless evacuated before heat conditions reach hazardous levels. Section 2D—Principal Effects of HD  1.4 Events 2.14.  Blast.  There  is  no  blast  associated  with  an  incident  involving  only  HD  1.4  (a  HD  1.4 event). 2.15.  Fragments. 2.15.1.  A HD 1.4 event will not produce fragments of appreciable energy (i.e., greater than 14.8 ft-lbs). 2.15.2.  Fragments from HD 1.4S have energies less than or equal to 5.9 ft-lbs. 2.16.  Thermal Hazards. 2.16.1.  AE given this designation are considered to provide only a moderate fire hazard.  A fireball or jet of flame may extend three feet beyond the location of the HD 1.4 event.  A burning  time  of  less  than  330  seconds  (5.5  minutes)  for  220  lbs  of  the  HD  1.4  AE  is expected. 2.16.2.  Firebrands.  No fiery projections are expected beyond 50 feet. 2.16.3.  Compatibility Group (CG) S Items.  HD 1.4 AE assigned a CG S designation is the most benign of all AE (see paragraph 3.21.13.).  In a HD 1.4 event that only involves CG S; the expected blast, thermal, and projection effects will not significantly hinder firefighting or other emergency responses. 2.17.  Expected  Consequences.  There  may  be  minor  consequences  (projection,  fire,  smoke, heat, or loud noise) beyond the AE itself. Section 2E—Principal Effects of HD  1.5 and HD  1.6 Events 2.18.  HD    1.5  Effects.  HD  1.5  effects  are  similar  to  those  produced  by  HD  1.1,  without  the fragmentation effects. 2.19.  HD  1.6 Effects.  HD 1.6 effects are similar to those produced by HD 1.3. 56 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Table 2.1.  Expected Peak Incident Pressures From HD  1.1 Events. Table 2.2.

The DoD Hazard Classification System is designed to reflect the type and degree of hazard associated with an AE item.  It is used to determine the degree  of  protection  (such  as  distance  separation)  needed  for  various  exposed  locations  and people, and to determine which items can be safely stored together.  Each AE item is assigned a hazard classification based on the form in which it is normally available as well as its common packaging, storage and transportation (commercial or military) configurations. Section 3A—DoD Hazard Classification System 3.2.  Responsibility for Hazard Classification.  Air Force organizations that develop or are the first to adopt AE items for use are responsible for obtaining DoD hazard classifications using the procedures  in  Technical  Order  (TO)  11A-1-47,  DoD  Ammunition  and  Explosives  Hazard Classification  Procedures.    It  is  the  program  office’s  responsibility  to  ensure  AE  items  are properly hazard classified before they enter Air Force installations. 3.3.  Hazard  Classification  Authorities  .  The  Air Force hazard classification authorities are assigned  to  HQ  AFSEC/SEW,  96  TW/SES,  and  AFLCMC/EBHE.    Army  and  Navy  hazard classification authorities are listed in TO 11A-1-47. 3.4.  Standards for Determining DoD Hazard Classification.  Use the following resources to identify AE hazard characteristics for storage and transportation purposes: 3.4.1.  TO 11A-1-47, as a basis for assigning hazard classifications to all AE for both storage and transportation applications. 3.4.2.  The applicable Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous materials regulations per  Title  49,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Parts  171-177,  Pipeline  and  Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, Department of Transportation. 3.4.3.  The  United  Nations’  (UN)  international  system  of  classification  developed  for  the transport  of  dangerous  goods,  ST/SG/AC.10/1/latest  revision,  Recommendations  on  the Transport of Dangerous Goods. 3.5.  Description of DoD Hazard Classification System.  The DoD hazard classification system consists of nine hazard classes and a not regulated category.  The explosives hazard class, Class 1,  is  divided  into  six  divisions  based  on  the  type  of  explosive  hazard  present.    The  hazard classification system also includes thirteen compatibility groups, five sensitivity groups, and a parenthetical number. 3.5.1.  Hazard Classes. 3.5.1.1.  Class  1.    AE  is  assigned  to  the  class  that  represents  an  item’s  predominant hazard characteristic.  Class 1 applies to AE in which the explosive hazard predominates.  The six Class 1 divisions used to indicate the character and predominance of explosive hazards.  This Manual uses the term “Hazard Division (HD)” to avoid repeatedly using the more cumbersome terminology “Subdivision X of Division Y of Class Z.”  Section 60 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 3D  describes  Class  1  divisions  and  subdivisions.    See  Chapter  2  for  detailed  reaction effects of Class 1 AE. 3.5.1.2.  Classes 2 through 9.  The DoD inventory includes AE items assigned to Class 2 (Gases),  Class  3  (Flammable  liquids),  Class  4.1  (Flammable  solids),  Class  5.1 (Oxidizers),  Class  6.1  (Toxic  materials),  Class  8  (Corrosive  materials),  and  Class  9 (Miscellaneous hazardous materials).   Although these items contain  a small amount of explosives, the predominant hazard is not an explosive reaction.  They  are assigned to Classes 2 through 9 based on the predominant  hazard.  The DoD hazard classification system  classifies  articles  that  contain  riot  control  substances,  without  explosives components, and bulk toxic materials as HD 6.1.  Any item that contains explosives, but is  not  assigned  to  Class  1  due  to  its  predominant  hazard,  is  considered  to  have  a  net explosive weight of zero for QD determinations.  Items that fall into this category do not contribute to the net explosive weight calculated for the storage site.  Even though such items are assigned to another class, they will still have a DoD storage compatibility group designation,  and  may  be  combined  in  storage  with  compatible  Class  1  items.    When Classes  2  through  9  ammunition  items  are  stored  alone,  they  do  not  require  siting  or licensing, except as an exposed site. 3.5.1.3.  Not-Regulated Category.  This category applies when explosives and hazardous materials are present in an item, but not to the degree that criteria for assignment to one of the nine classes are met.  Items that contain a hazardous material, but that have been designated  Not-Regulated,  do  not  require  storage  or  handling  as  a  hazardous  material.  The explosive weight of Not-Regulated items is not considered for QD purposes. 3.5.2.  Compatibility Groups.  Compatibility Groups (CG) are used for segregating AE on the basis  of  similarity  of  function,  features,  and  accident  effects  potential.    In  developing  the various compatibility  groups, the following factors are considered:   chemical and physical properties, design characteristics, inner and outer packaging configurations, hazard class and division, NEWQD, rate of deterioration, sensitivity to initiation, and effects of deflagration, explosion, or detonation.  The compatibility groups are described in Section 3E. 3.5.3.  Sensitivity Groups.  Sensitivity Groups (SG) are used for determining allowable net explosive  weights  where  revetments  or  substantial  dividing  walls  (SDW)  are  used.    The sensitivity groups are described in Section 3E. 3.5.4.  Parenthetical  Number.    A  parenthetical  number  is  used  to  indicate  the  minimum separation distance (in hundreds of feet) for protection from debris, fragments, and firebrands when distance alone is relied on for such protection.  This number is placed to the left of the hazard classification designators (e.g., (12)1.1, (08)1.2.3, or (02)1.3).  It is assigned for all HD 1.2.3 items, and some HD 1.1 and 1.3 items. 3.6.  Net Explosive Weight (NEW) and NEW for Quantity-Distance (NEWQD).  NEW is the total quantity, expressed in pounds (kilograms), of explosives material or pyrotechnics in each item or round whereas NEWQD is the total quantity, expressed in pounds (kilograms), of HE equivalency in each item or round to be used when applying QD criteria or other standards. 3.6.1.  The NEW listed in DoD Joint Hazard Classification System (JHCS) is the total weight of  all  explosive,  propellant,  and  pyrotechnic  material  in  a  single  article.    The  NEW  is AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 61 identified because transportation regulations require documentation of the NEW on shipping papers for transportation. 3.6.2.  The NEWQD is used for explosives siting, munitions storage, and operating locations.  The NEWQD is equal to the NEW unless hazard classification testing has shown that a lower weight is appropriate for QD purposes.  If the NEWQD is less than the NEW, the reason is usually that propellant or other substances do not contribute as much to the blast effect as the same amount of HE would.  If NEWQD criteria are available for assets it should be used in the formula when calculating the amount of NEW on pads, in operating locations and storage locations. 3.7.  Requirement  for  DoD  Hazard  Classification.  Except  as  allowed  in  Section  3B,  DoD hazard classifications are required as follows: 3.7.1.  An  interim  hazard  classification  (IHC)  must  be  assigned  to  explosives  under development, test articles, components, and commercial products not having a final hazard classification (FHC) if they are transported or stored on DoD property. (T-1).  DoD hazard classification  authorities  document  the  IHC  in  letters.    These  letters  must  be  included  in storage and shipment documentation until the classification is finalized. (T-1).  The agency obtaining the IHC must renew it upon termination (as specified in the letter). (T-1).  This applies if the item is still in the inventory or until an FHC is determined.  IHCs assigned by Army and Navy classification authorities are acceptable to the Air Force. 3.7.2.  An FHC must be assigned for explosives items that have become operationally fielded and  items  requiring  commercial  shipping  OCONUS.  (T-1).    DoD  FHCs  are  listed  in  the JHCS.    Access  to  the  JHCS  can  be  made  through  the  Defense  Ammunition  Center  at https://www3.dac.army.mil/.  Final DoD hazard classifications assigned by Army and Navy hazard classification authorities are acceptable to the Air Force. Section 3B—Storage and Transportation Without DoD Hazard Classification 3.8.  Storage and Transportation Without DoD Hazard Classification.  Occasionally it may be  necessary  to  store  or  transport  explosive  substances  or  articles  that  do  not  have  a  DoD-assigned FHC or IHC.  Since such items are not listed in the JHCS, the unit having custody of these  items  must  exercise  care  in  maintaining  appropriate  approval  and  hazard  classification documentation at the storage installation. (T-0).  Such documentation may include Department of  Energy  (DOE)  IHC,  DOT  EX-numbers,  or  locally-assigned  storage  hazard  classifications established IAW procedures approved by AFSEC/SEW.  Paragraphs 3.9,  3.10.,  3.11.,  3.12., and    3.13.  describe  the  circumstances  and  the  respective  applicable  conditions  for  storing  or transporting AE without DoD hazard classification. 3.9.  Explosives With DOE Hazard Classifications. 3.9.1.  An item covered by a DOE IHC may be stored and offered for military or commercial transportation using that classification, subject to the requirements of paragraph 3.9.3.  A copy of the applicable DOE IHC must be maintained at the installation where the items are stored, and must be carried with shipping papers on board each conveyance used to transport the items under that IHC. (T-0). 3.9.2.  An item covered by a DOE FHC may be stored and offered for military or commercial transportation using that classification, subject to the requirements of paragraph 3.9.3.  For 62 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 storage  using  DOE  FHCs,  installation  records  must  reflect  the  DOT  EX-number,  Class, Division, Compatibility Group, and NEW for each item stored. (T-0). 3.9.3.  Restrictions on the use of DOE hazard classifications: 3.9.3.1.  Treat DOE assigned HD 1.2 as HD 1.2.1 and DOE assigned HD 1.5 as HD 1.1 unless  an  Air  Force  hazard  classification  authority  determines  a  different  hazard classification applies (see paragraph 3.3.). 3.9.3.2.  Use the compatibility group assigned by DOE. 3.9.3.3.  The NEWQD equals the NEW.  For quantity-distance purposes, the NEWQD of articles  hazard  classified  by  DOE  as  HD  1.4S  or  as  Not-Regulated  equals  zero.    See paragraph 3.16.4. for MCE for HD 1.2.1. 3.9.3.4.  Only  store  or  transport  items  in  the  same  or  equivalent  packaging  they  were hazard classified. 3.10.  DoD-Owned  Non-Stock-Listed  Commercial  Explosives.  A  unit  may  have  a requirement to purchase a non-stock-listed commercial explosive product for evaluation or use.  Although such items are not standard military inventory items, they are DoD-owned explosives once purchased.  Commercial products are items that are not unique to military use and that are legally  available  for  purchase  and  use  by  the  general  public  or  private  businesses  (e.g.  commercial  small  arms  ammunition,  components  and  propellants;  power  tool  cartridges;  fire extinguisher  cartridges;  signal  devices;  pest  control  devices;  theatrical  special  effects  items; commercial  demolition  materials;  and  blasting  agents).    The  following  requirements  apply  to such explosives: 3.10.1.  Hazard  Classification.    The  unit  may  request  a  DoD  IHC  for  a  non-stock-listed commercial  explosive  item.    Alternatively,  store  and  offer  the  item  for  military  or commercial transportation using the classification assigned for the product by DOT, subject to the requirements of paragraph 3.10.8.  The classification assigned to commercial small arms cartridges by the manufacturer as prescribed in 49 CFR Part 173.56(h) may also be used for storage and transportation without a DoD hazard classification. 3.10.2.  Requirements for Purchase. 3.10.2.1.  Commanders  must  ensure  the  requirements  below  are  accomplished  prior  to purchase of a non-stock-listed commercial explosive item for operational use. (T-1).: 3.10.2.1.1.  Safety  certification  as  specified  in  AFI  91-205,  Nonnuclear  Munitions Safety Board. 3.10.2.1.2.  Purchase approval from AFLCMC/EBHE.  Submit requests for approval according to AFI 21-201, Munitions Management. Note:  Requirements for non-stock-listed commercial explosives for research and development (R&D) activities will comply with paragraph 3.10.2.1. and applicable MAJCOM supplements to this Manual. (T-1). 3.10.2.2.  AFSEC/SEW  approves  emergency  requirements  to  purchase  non-stock-listed commercial explosives. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 63 3.10.3.  Adoption into the DoD Inventory.  Commercial explosive items adopted as standard DoD inventory items, as evidenced by  centralized item management by  an Air Force  Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) or by another military service and assignment of a National Stock Number (NSN), must be covered by a DoD IHC or FHC (T-0). 3.10.4.  Commercial  Fireworks.    Commercial  fireworks  may  not  be  purchased  by  the  Air Force under any circumstances. 3.10.5.  A  commercial  product  received  as  Black  Powder  for  Small  Arms,  Class  4.1, Identification Number NA0027, is stored as Black Powder, HD 1.1D. 3.10.6.  A  commercial  product  received  as  Smokeless  Powder  for  Small  Arms,  Class  4.1, Identification Number NA3178, is stored as Powder, Smokeless, and HD 1.3C. 3.10.7.  A commercial product received as Cartridges, Small Arms, ORM-D, is stored as HD 1.4C unless a different hazard classification is issued by a DoD or DOE IHC authority and is on file at the installation. 3.10.8.  DOT  Hazard  Classifications.    For  storage  using  DOT  hazard  classifications, installation files must have the DOT EX-number, Class, Division, Compatibility Group, and NEW, for each item stored. (T-1). 3.10.8.1.  Treat DOE or DOT assigned HD 1.2 as HD 1.2.1, and DOE or DOT assigned HD 1.5 HD 1.1, unless an Air Force hazard classification authority determines a different hazard classification might apply (see paragraph 3.3.). 3.10.8.2.  Use the compatibility group assigned by DOT. 3.10.8.3.  The  NEWQD  equals  the  NEW  and  for  quantity-distance  purposes,  the NEWQD of articles hazard classified by DOT as HD 1.4S or as Not-Regulated will equal zero.  See paragraph 3.16.4. for MCE for HD 1.2.1. 3.10.8.4.  Only transport and store items in the same or equivalent packaging they were hazard classified in. 3.11.  Manufacturing, R&D Items.  In manufacturing, R&D environments, explosives samples, substances, subassemblies, and items may be acquired, produced, and stored without DoD, DOT or DOE hazard classifications, provided they comply with paragraph 3.10.2.1. and applicable MAJCOM supplements. 3.11.1.  Transport and store these items on-base IAW locally assigned hazard classifications provided a formal procedure for establishing and documenting the hazard classifications is approved by the MAJCOM/SEW and AFSEC/SEW. 3.11.2.  Commanders  must  ensure  these  items  are  not  offered  for  transportation  from  the installation  or  development  location  until  the  necessary  DoD,  DOT  or  DOE  hazard classification is assigned. (T-1).  Traversing a public roadway between gates or sites on the same  installation  is  considered  on-base  transportation  provided  the  transportation  is  in  a DoD-owned vehicle operated by DoD personnel. 3.11.3.  Commanders  must  ensure  these  items  have  Explosives  Ordnance  Disposal  (EOD) procedures available prior to use. (T-1).  The responsible test organization ensures local EOD activities receive a Source Data Package (SDP) prior to delivery of test assets.  Develop the 64 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 SDP according to DID DI-SAFT-80931, Explosives Ordnance Disposal Data and TO 00-5-3, Air Force Technical Order Lifecycle Management. 3.12.  Foreign  Explosives.  Foreign-owned  military  AE items  brought  onto  Air  Force installations  to  support  Multinational  military  training,  exercises,  operations  or  cargo  airlift operations  may  be  stored  IAW  the  hazard  classifications  assigned  by  the  appropriate  foreign competent authorities, provided: 3.12.1.  MAJCOMs  document  procedures  for  obtaining  AFSEC/SEW  approval  of  these items. 3.12.2.  The procedures required in paragraph 3.12.1. must: 3.12.2.1.  Require  MAJCOM/SEW  to  attain  and  forward  to  AFSEC/SEW  shipping documents for each foreign munitions item requiring hazard classification. 3.12.2.2.  Require the installation to maintain documentation of AFSEC/SEW review and approval of each item. (T-1). 3.12.2.3.  Require  the  installation  to  maintain  documentation  of  the  foreign  hazard classification of each item. (T-1). 3.12.3.  Hazard  classification  documentation  approved  by the  multinational  forces’ competent authorities for their explosives and munitions is acceptable (in lieu of IHCs) for military  air  transportation  between  the  foreign  departure  points  and  foreign  destinations, regardless  of  whether  an  intermediate  stopover  in  the  US  occurs.    Such  approval documentation  is  similarly  acceptable  for  in-transit  storage  of  multinational  forces’ explosives  and  munitions  on  U.S.  installations  worldwide.    At  a  minimum,  multinational approval  documentation  includes:    the  assigned  proper  shipping  name,  United  Nations identification number, hazard class/division and compatibility group, the quantity of articles per  package,  and  must  be  written  in  English.    A  copy  of  the  multinational  hazard classification  approval  documentation  accompanies  military  air  shipments  and  are  kept  on file  at  installations  where  multinational  forces’  explosives  and  munitions  are  temporarily stored  during  transit.    Explosives  and  munitions  classed  HD  1.2  by  multinational  forces’ competent authorities are managed as HD 1.2.1 when sited on real property controlled by the US, or when possessed by US forces. 3.12.4.  DoD  IHCs  assigned  IAW  T.O.  11A-1-47  accompanying  airlift  cargo  may  be  used without AFSEC/SEW approval. 3.13.  Non-DoD-Owned  Explosives.  Storage  of  non-DoD-owned  explosives  on  Air  Force installations  is  prohibited  except  for  specific  exceptions  stated  in  AFI  32-9003,  Granting Temporary  Use  of  Air  Force  Real  Property  and  10  USC  2692  with  1998  Authorization  Act changes, Storage, treatment, and disposal of nondefense toxic and hazardous materials.  Some of these exceptions require approval from the SECAF or Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Environment).    Units  will  forward  requests  through  their  MAJCOMs.  (T-1).    Obtain coordination from MAJCOM  A4, JA, SE and AFSEC/SEW prior to forwarding to Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA) for action. (T-1). Paragraph 3.13.1. identifies situations that do not require approval.  When non-DoD-owned explosives are stored on an Air Force installation under  one  of  the  exceptions,  DOE  or  DOT  hazard  classifications  may  be  used  subject  to  the AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 65 requirements in paragraph 3.13.2.  Commanders must ensure commercial launch vehicles also comply with paragraph 3.13.3. (T-1). 3.13.1.  Situations Not Requiring Approval. 3.13.1.1.  Ammunition that is privately-owned by military members or their dependents can  be  stored  on  an  Air  Force  installation,  if  the  military  member  is  assigned  to  that installation, or lives in billeting or a dormitory on that installation. 3.13.1.2.  Non-DoD-owned explosives that may be or have been used in connection with an  activity  of  the  DoD,  or  in  connection  with  a  service  to  be  performed  on  a  DoD installation  for  the  benefit  of  the  DoD,  can  be  stored  or  disposed  of  on  an  Air  Force installation (see paragraph 12.86.). 3.13.1.3.  Non-DoD-owned  explosives  may  be  temporarily  stored  or  disposed  of  on  an Air  Force  installation  in  order  to  provide  emergency  life-saving  assistance  to  civil authorities (see paragraph 12.86.). 3.13.1.4.  Non-DoD-owned  explosives  that  constitute  military  resources  intended  to  be used during peacetime civil emergencies IAW applicable DoD regulations may be stored on an Air Force installation (see paragraph 12.86.). 3.13.1.5.  Explosives  of  other  Federal  agencies  meeting  the  definition  of  “DoD Explosives  Operations/Storage”  may  be  stored  on  an  Air  Force  installation  when  no alternative solutions are available provided all other storage requirements can be met. 3.13.2.  DOE or DOT Hazard Classifications.  For storage using a DOE IHC, a copy of the applicable DOE IHC must be maintained at the installation where the items are stored. (T-1).  For storage using a DOE FHC, installation records must reflect the DOT EX-number, Class, Division,  Compatibility  Group,  and  NEW  for  each  item  stored.  (T-1).    For  storage  using DOT  hazard  classifications,  installation  files  must  have  the  DOT  EX-number,  Class, Division,  Compatibility  Group,  and  NEW,  for  each  item  stored.  (T-1).    The  following additional requirements apply: 3.13.2.1.  Items classed by DOE or DOT as HD 1.2 must be treated as HD 1.2.1 and HD 1.5 items must be treated as HD 1.1.   If a different hazard classification might apply, contact an Air Force hazard classification authority (see paragraph 3.3.) to determine the correct classification. 3.13.2.2.  Use the compatibility group assigned by DOE or DOT. 3.13.2.3.  The NEWQD equals the NEW.  For quantity-distance purposes, the NEWQD of articles hazard classified by DOE or DOT as HD 1.4S or as Not-Regulated equal zero.  See paragraph 3.16.4. for MCE for HD 1.2.1. 3.13.2.4.  Transport of store items only in the same or equivalent packaging in which they were hazard classified. 3.13.2.5.  A  commercial  product  received  as  Black  Powder  for  Small  Arms,  Class  4.1, Identification Number NA0027, is stored as Black Powder, HD 1.1D. 3.13.2.6.  A commercial  product received  as Smokeless Powder  for Small Arms, Class 4.1, Identification Number NA3178, is stored as Powder, Smokeless, and HD 1.3C. 66 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 3.13.2.7.  A commercial product received as Cartridges, Small Arms, ORM-D, is stored as  HD  1.4C  unless  a  different  hazard  classification  is  issued  by  a  DoD  or  DOE  IHC authority and is on file at the installation. 3.13.3.  Commercial Launch Vehicles. 3.13.3.1.  The responsible Commander contacts the responsible MAJCOM/SEW, who in turn contacts the AFSEC/SEW hazard classification authority for the  assignment of an HD 1.3 hazard classification of a rocket motor. (T-1). 3.13.3.2.  For  commercial  launch  vehicles  fueled  by  liquid  propellants,  the  explosive equivalents of the fuel combinations (see Section 12N) may be used instead of the total weight of fuel in the vehicle for quantity-distance purposes.   Lesser weights, based on launch  vehicle  failure  analyses,  may  be  used  with  the  approval  of  AFSEC/SEW  and DDESB.    Likewise,  a  commercial  solid  rocket  booster  or  booster  section  located  at  a DoD range launch facility may be stored using an NEWQD less than 100 percent of the propellant weight only with approval of AFSEC/SEW and DDESB. Section 3C—Hazard Classification of Unpackaged Items 3.14.  Hazard Classification of Unpackaged Items.  When ammunition or explosive items are not  in  the  form  and  packaging  they  are  normally  stored  and  shipped,  different  hazard classifications may apply due to changes in spacing, orientation, confinement, and other factors.  Sometimes  testing  of  unpackaged  components  may  be  required  in  order  to  demonstrate  the validity of classifications used for siting unpackaged ammunition, or conservative assumptions must  be  made  about  the  potential  severity  of  an  accidental  explosion.    Contact  an  Air  Force hazard  classification  authority  for  assistance  in  determining  the  hazard  classification  of  an unpackaged item (see paragraph 3.3.). (T-1). 3.14.1.  The  hazard  classification  for  some  unpackaged  items  may  be  given  in  paragraph 3.14.2.  or  in  the  item  TO.    Not-Regulated  CG  S  items  were  classed  based  on  how  the unpackaged item reacts.  Therefore the presence or absence of packaging does not change that designation. 3.14.2.  The following are hazard classifications for certain unpackaged items: 3.14.2.1.  Cartridges,  40  mm,  High  Explosive  Dual-Purpose  (HEDP),  M433  stored  in CNU  541/E  Containers  (modified  MK  387  MOD  0  containers  with  CEMCOM  buffer liners)  are  HD  1.2.2,  with  an  NEWQD  of  0.102  pounds  per  cartridge.    This  hazard classification is for storage only, not for transportation. Note:  CNU 541/E Containers are no longer available; however, this information is provided for existing containers. 3.14.2.2.  Cartridges,  40  mm,  General  Purpose  (GP),  M406  stored  in  18-round Ammunition Carrying Vests folded into M2A1 or M548 Ammunition Cans with plastic projectile  covers  installed  are  hazard  classified  as  HD  1.2.2E,  SG-3.    This  hazard classification is for storage only and requires each cartridge to be securely nested into a projectile cover made by cutting the 3-round plastic supports from approved bandoleer packs into single-round supports.  This hazard classification is for storage only, not for AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 67 transportation.    40  mm  HE/HEDP  are  HD  1.1.  when  out  of  approved  packaging configuration. 3.14.2.3.  20 mm and 30 mm High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) cartridges, designated HD 1.2.2 when packaged, remain HD 1.2.2 when unpackaged. 3.14.2.4.  Cartridges for small arms which have inert or tracer projectiles, are below .50 caliber, and are not in their standard packaging are classified as HD 1.4S when kept in closed metal ammunition boxes.  They are considered HD 1.4C in other containers. 3.14.2.5.  Cluster Bomb Unit (CBU)-87/89/97/103/104/105, T-1 is considered HD 1.2.2 out of shipping containers. 3.14.2.6.  2.75-in  Infrared  Illuminating  Warheads  (M278)  and  the  2.75-in  White Phosphorus  (WP)  (M156)  stored  in  a  Launch  Adapter  Unit  (LAU)-131  launcher  or transportation  modules  (out  of  shipping  containers)  are  classified  as  HD  1.2.1.    This hazard classification does not apply to public transportation. 3.14.2.7.  HD  1.3  Minuteman  and  HD  1.3  Peacekeeper  missile  stages  with  an  HD  1.1 type (CL1/AODS) destruct system installed are considered HD 1.3. 3.14.2.8.  Guided  Bomb  Unit  (GBU)-39/B  Small  Diameter  Bomb  (SDB),  GBU-39A/B SDB Focused Lethality Munition (FLM), and GBU-39B/B Laser SDB out of container are HD 1.1.  In an all-up-round container (AURC) they are HD 1.2.3. Section 3D—Class 1 Divisions and Subdivisions 3.15.  HD  1.1 – Mass-Explosion. 3.15.1.  Blast is the primary hazard in this division.  HD 1.1 items may be expected to mass detonate when a small portion is initiated by any means.  These explosions generally cause severe  structural  damage  to  adjacent  objects.    Propagation  may  occur  so  rapidly  to unprotected  explosives  stored  near  the  initially  exploding  stack  that  quantities  must  be considered as a single source for QD purposes.  The combined shock wave, in this case, is the  same  as  a  single  detonation  of  a  charge  equal  to  the  total  quantity  of  the  stacks  (see simultaneous detonation in Attachment 1). 3.15.2.  Items in this division also generally present a fragmentation hazard, either from the case  of  the  explosive  device  or  from  the  packaging  or  facility  where  the  explosives  are stored. 3.15.3.  HD 1.1 items include bulk HE, some propellants, mines, bombs, demolition charges, some missile warheads, some rockets, palletized projectiles loaded with bulk trinitrotoluene (TNT)  or  Comp  B,  mass-detonating  CBU,  and  ammunition  components  having  mass-detonating characteristics. 3.16.  HD  1.2 – Non-Mass Explosion, Fragment Producing. 3.16.1.  Items  in  this  division  will  not  mass  detonate  when  configured  for  storage  or transportation if a single item or package is initiated.  When these items function, the results are burning and exploding progressively with no more than a few reacting at a time.  The explosion  will  throw  fragments,  firebrands,  and  non-functioned  items  from  the  point  of initiation.  Blast effects are limited to the immediate vicinity and are not the primary hazard. 68 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 3.16.2.  In an incident, the quantity distances specified for HD 1.2 items achieve the desired degree  of  protection  against  immediate  hazards.    Events  involving  HD  1.2  items  that  lob large  amounts  of  unexploded  rounds,  components,  and  subassemblies,  remain  hazardous after impact.  Such items are likely to be more hazardous than they were in their original state because fuze safety devices or other features may sustain heat and impact damage.  Expect the sub-munitions, such as cluster bombs, of many types of munitions, to project distances as great as the relevant IBD.  Furthermore, it is impractical to specify quantity distances which allow for the maximum possible flight ranges of propulsive items. 3.16.3.  HD 1.2 items’ functioning effects vary with the size and weight of the item.  These items are separated into three subdivisions (1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3) to account for the differences in magnitude of these effects and to set quantity-distance criteria. 3.16.4.  HD  1.2.1.    Generally,  these  items  have  an  NEWQD  greater  than  1.60  pounds  or exhibit  fragmentation  characteristics  similar  to  or  greater  than  (higher  density,  longer distance) M1 105 mm projectiles regardless of NEWQD.  The MCE for a specific HD 1.2.1 item is the largest quantity of explosives expected to explode at one time when a stack of those specific items is involved in a fire.  MCEs will be included in the JHCS for each HD 1.2.1  item.    If  the  MCE  is  not  available,  use  the  default  MCE  determined  by  multiplying NEWQD in a single container by three. 3.16.5.  HD 1.2.2.  Generally, these items have an NEWQD less than or equal to 1.60 pounds or  that  at  most  exhibit  fragmentation  characteristics  similar  to  high-explosive  40  mm ammunition regardless of NEWQD. 3.16.6.  HD 1.2.3.  These items do not exhibit any sympathetic detonation response in the stack test, or any reaction more severe than burning in the external fire test, bullet impact test, or slow cook-off test. 3.17.  HD  1.3–Mass Fire, Minor Blast or Fragment.  Items in this division burn vigorously and the fires are difficult to put out.  Explosions are caused by pressure ruptures of containers, which may produce fragments (especially missile motors) but will not produce propagating shock waves or damaging blast overpressure beyond IMD.  Burning container materials, propellant, firebrands, or other debris may be projected randomly, presenting a severe fire hazard.  Depending on the amounts of burning explosive materials, their downwind toxic effects usually do not extend beyond IBD. 3.18.  HD  1.4–Moderate Fire, No Significant Blast or Fragment.  Items in this division present a fire hazard but no blast hazard.  There is virtually no fragmentation or toxic hazard beyond the fire hazard clearance ordinarily specified for high-risk materials. 3.19.  HD  1.5–Explosive Substance, Very Insensitive (With Mass Explosion Hazard).  Substances in this division have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to detonation under normal transport or storage conditions. 3.20.  HD  1.6–Explosive Article, Extremely Insensitive (No Mass Explosion Hazard).  Items in this division contain only extremely insensitive detonating substances (EIDS), and demonstrate a negligible probability of accidental ignition or propagation.  Fuzed HD 1.6 items must contain either an EIDS fuze or a non-explosive fuze (i.e., the fuze contains no explosives), otherwise the item is classified as HD 1.2.3. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 69 Section 3E—Compatibility Groups and Sensitivity Groups 3.21.  Storage and Transportation Compatibility Groups. 3.21.1.  Group  A.    This  group  includes  bulk  initiating  explosives  that  have  the  necessary sensitivity to heat, friction, or percussion to make them suitable for use as initiating elements in an explosive train (e.g. bulk lead azide, lead styphnate, mercury fulminate, tetracene, dry cyclonite (RDX), and dry pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN)). 3.21.2.  Group  B.    This  group  includes  detonators  and  similar  initiating  devices  not containing  two  or  more  effective  protective  features.    It  also  includes  items  containing initiating  explosives  designed  to  initiate  or  continue  the  functioning  of  an  explosive  train (e.g. detonators, blasting caps, small arms primers, and fuzes). 3.21.3.  Group  C.    This  group  includes  bulk  propellants,  propelling  charges,  and  devices containing propellant with or without its own means of ignition (e.g. bulk single-, double-, or triple-base,  and  composite  propellants,  rocket  motors  (solid  propellant),  and  propelled  AE with inert projectiles). 3.21.4.  Group D.  This group includes bulk black powder and bulk HE.  It also includes AE having no propelling charge, but does contain HE without its own means of initiation, that is there  is  no  initiating  device  present  or  the  device  has  two  or  more  effective  protective features  (e.g.  TNT,  Composition  B,  and  black  powder;  bulk  wet  RDX  or  PETN;  bombs, projectiles, CBUs, depth charges, and torpedo warheads). 3.21.5.  Group E.  AE in this group contains HE without its own means of initiation but with, or containing, a solid propelling charge (e.g. artillery AE, rockets, and guided missiles). 3.21.6.  Group F.  AE in this group contains HE with its own means of initiation, that is  the initiating device present has less than two effective protective features and may or may not have a solid propelling charge (e.g.  grenades, sounding devices, and similar items with less than two effective protective features in their explosive trains). 3.21.7.  Group  G.    This  group  includes  illuminating,  incendiary  and  smoke-  (including hexachlorethane  [HC])  or  tear-producing  AE.    This  excludes  AE  that  are  water-activated, contain  WP  or  are  flammable  liquids  or  gels.    Examples  include  flares,  signals,  and pyrotechnic substances. 3.21.8.  Group H.  In this group, AE contain WP or fillers spontaneously flammable when exposed to the atmosphere (e.g. WP and plasticized white phosphorus (PWP)). 3.21.9.  Group J.  In this group, AE contain flammable liquids or gels other than those that are  spontaneously  flammable  when  exposed  to  water  or  the  atmosphere  (e.g.  liquid  or gelfilled  incendiary  AE,  fuelair  explosive  (FAE)  devices,  and  flammable  liquidfueled missiles and torpedoes. 3.21.10.  Group  K.    In  this  group,  AE  contain  toxic  chemical  agents  or  contain  chemicals specifically  designed  for  incapacitating  effects  more  severe  than  lachrymation  (tear-producing)  (e.g.  artillery  or  mortar  AE  (fuzed  or  unfuzed),  grenades,  rockets  and  bombs filled with a lethal or incapacitating chemical agents).  (See Table 7.1, Note 4.) 3.21.11.  Group  L.    This  group  contains  AE  not  included  in  other  CG,  such  as  AE  with characteristics that present a special risk that does not permit storage with other types of AE 70 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 or with dissimilar AE of this group (e.g. water-activated devices, pyrophorics and phosphides and  devices  containing  these  substances,  prepackaged  hypergolic  liquid-fueled  rocket engines, triethyl aluminum (TEA), thickened TEA (TPA), and damaged or suspect AE of any group). Note: Different types of AE in CG L presenting similar hazards may be stored together. 3.21.12.  Group N.  In this group, AE contain only EIDS (e.g., HD 1.6 AE). 3.21.13.  Group S.  AE in this group present no significant hazard.  AE packaged or designed so that any hazardous effects from accidental functioning are limited to an extent that they do not significantly hinder firefighting are included in this group.  Projections must not exceed eight Joules (e.g. explosive switches or valves, and small arms ammunition). 3.22.  Sensitivity Groups.  Where earth-filled steel bin revetments or SDWs are used for storage purposes, each HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE item is designated, based on its physical attributes, into one  of  five  SG.    Directed  energy  weapons  are  further  identified  by  assigning  the  suffix  “D” following the SG designation (e.g., SG2D).  The SG assigned to an AE item is listed in the JHCS (see paragraph 6.27.3. for application and use of SG criteria with SDWs to prevent propagation to adjacent rooms or cubicles).  Item-specific testing or analyses can be used to change an item’s SG.  The five SGs, in relative order from least sensitive to most sensitive, are: 3.22.1.  SG 1.  Robust (see glossary in Attachment 1) military munitions. 3.22.2.  SG 2.  Non-robust (see glossary in Attachment 1) military munitions. 3.22.3.  SG 3.  Fragmenting military munitions. 3.22.4.  SG  4.    Cluster  bombs  or  dispenser  unit  military  munitions  (see  Attachment  1 glossary). 3.22.5.  SG 5.  Sympathetic detonation (SD)-sensitive military munitions. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 71 Chapter 4 RISK ASSESSMENTS AND PROTECTION PRINCIPLES Section 4A—Risk Assessments 4.1.  Requirements for Risk Assessments. 4.1.1.  Risk  assessments  are  required  for  all  new  or  modified  explosives,  explosives operations,  equipment  and  facilities  when  not  specifically  covered  in  current  Air  Force guidance and/or approved publications. (T-1). 4.1.2.  These  risk  assessments  will  be  used  to  identify  design  and  operations  criteria  (e.g., shielding,  protective  clothing).  (T-1).    See  Chapter  2  for  reaction  effect  information  to support risk assessments.  Use deliberate Risk Management  (RM) when conducting a risk assessment and consider the following factors, as appropriate: 4.1.2.1.  Initiation sensitivity. 4.1.2.2.  Quantity of materials. 4.1.2.3.  Heat output. 4.1.2.4.  Rate of burn. 4.1.2.5.  Potential ignition and initiation sources. 4.1.2.6.  Protection capabilities of shields, types of clothing, and fire protection systems. 4.1.2.7.  Personnel exposure. 4.2.  Risk Assessments. 4.2.1.  Explosives safety criteria in this Manual help Commanders make informed decisions on  the  proper  mix  of  combat  readiness  and  safety.    This  criteria  specifies  minimum acceptable  standards  for  explosives  safety.    Compliance  with  these  criteria  still  entails  a significant  risk  to  personnel,  assets  and  facilities.    RM  may  be  used  to  further  reduce, mitigate, or accept risks (see paragraph 4.3.). 4.2.2.  Explosives risk assessments are a subset of the Commander’s overall RM program.  An  explosives  risk  assessment  analyzes  hazards  associated  with  transporting,  storing, disposing of, handling or firing AE materials.  Explosives risk assessments may range from examining the relationship between a PES and an ES to determine what effect one has on the other  in  the  event  of  an  accidental  explosion,  to  ascertaining  the  worst  credible  event ramifications  of  an  explosives  handling  mishap.    Although  risk  assessments  are  required when explosives standards cannot be met, they must also be routinely used in other instances as a Commander’s management tool (e.g.,combat loaded aircraft parked on an open ramp, separated  by  K11,  meet  the  required  QD  separation  per  this  Manual).  (T-1).    However, Commanders  must  also  be  advised  that  in  this  situation  the  total  destruction  of  adjacent aircraft is certain and that propagation is likely in the event of an explosion on one of the combat loaded aircraft. (T-1).  The Commander must also be apprised of the probability of such an event happening. (T-1).  72 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 4.3.  Risk Management (RM). 4.3.1.  According to AFI 90-802, Risk Management, the following RM principles apply: (1) Accept no unnecessary  risk, (2) Make  risk decisions at the appropriate level, (3)  Integrate RM into operations, activities and planning at all levels, (4) Apply the process cyclically and continuously. 4.3.2.  Refer  to  AFPAM  90-803,  Risk  Management  Guidelines  and  Tools,  for  methods  on eliminating or reducing risk to support the five-step process of RM (see Figure 4.1.).  The RM  process  may  not  be  used  to  violate  directives  or  other  regulatory  guidance;  normal waiver or variance procedures must be followed in all cases.  For exceptions to criteria in this Manual, refer to Section 1B. 4.4.  System Safety.  System safety is the application of engineering and management principles, criteria,  and  techniques  to  optimize  all  aspects  of  safety  within  the  constraints  of  operational effectiveness, time, and cost throughout all phases of the system life cycle.  The system safety process is  governed by  Military Standard  (MIL-STD)-882E, System Safety, and is intended to ensure hazards are identified early  enough in the design phase of  a program to either remove them  through  engineering  design  changes  or  to  mitigate  the  associated  risk  to  an  acceptable level.  Similar to the RM processes, the system safety processes require the remaining risk to be accepted by the appropriate authority. 4.5.  Professional Assistance for Risk Assessments and System Safety Analyses.  Units may experience  situations  when  civil,  structural,  electrical,  safety,  etc.  engineering  support  is necessary  to  perform  a  risk  assessment  or  system  safety  analysis.    There  are  numerous governmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) available for professional assistance.  Contact your MAJCOM/SEW for assistance. Section 4B—Munitions Systems and Equipment 4.6.  Safety Certification of Munitions Systems.  All operational nonnuclear munitions systems used  by  the  Air  Force  require  safety  certification  as  specified  in  AFI  91-205,  Nonnuclear Munitions Safety Board.  Risk assessments are accomplished, using the systems safety process for  all  new  or  modified  operational  munitions  systems  as  a  part  of  this  safety  certification process.    The  safety  certification  process  ensures  that  residual  risks  are  mitigated  to  an acceptable level via engineering or procedural controls.  Engineering controls are incorporated into the design.  Procedural controls are documented in item TOs, or other operating procedures and instructions. 4.7.  Risk  Assessments  for  Explosives  Equipment.  Risk  assessments  for  new  or  modified explosives  equipment  are  typically  accomplished  as  part  of  the  munitions  safety  certification process and resultant engineering controls are incorporated into the design (see paragraph 4.6.).  Procedural  controls  are  documented  in  the  item  TO  or  other  operating  procedures  and instructions.    For  explosives  equipment  unique  to  the  local  environment,  perform  a  risk assessment and document any required procedural controls in a locally written instruction (see Section 7B). (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 73 Section 4C—Explosives Operations and Facilities 4.8.  Risk  Assessment  for  Explosives  Operations.  Risk  assessments  for  new  or  modified explosives operations are typically accomplished as part of the safety certification of munitions systems  and  resultant  engineering  controls  are  incorporated  into  the  munitions  system, equipment, or facility design (see paragraph 4.6.).  Procedural controls are documented in the item TO or other operating procedures and instructions.  For explosives operations unique to the local environment, risk assessments are implemented through the ESP; document any operational limitations in a locally written instruction to ensure safety (see Section 7B). 4.9.  Risk Assessments for Explosives Facilities. 4.9.1.  Responsible  agencies  perform  risk  assessments  when  they  establish  a  definitive drawing  for  proposed  new  explosives  facilities.    No  further  risk  assessments  need  to  be accomplished. 4.9.2.  Design agents are responsible for the risk assessment of new or modified explosives facilities  not  having  a  definitive  drawing.    Design  agents  must  accomplish  the  risk assessment as part of the design process. (T-1). 4.9.3.  When protective construction is required for the new or modified explosives facility (or  any  exposed  facility),  Commanders  will  ensure  the  requirement  for  risk  assessments, systems safety analyses, and engineering analyses as well as the requirements for protective construction design (see Section 6B) are accomplished  IAW AFI  32-1023, Designing and Constructing Military Construction Projects. (T-1). 4.9.4.  When  protective  construction  is  not  required  for  the  new  or  modified  explosives facility (or any exposed facility), the ESP satifies the risk assessment requirement. 4.9.5.  Risk  assessments  for  modifications  to  explosives  facilities  assess  whether  the modification  will  cause  additional  hazards  or  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  built-in  safety features of the facility. Section 4D—Glass Breakage Risk Assessments 4.10.  Purpose of Glass Breakage Risk Assessments. 4.10.1.  In  the  event  of  an  explosives  mishap,  glass  can  present  a  significant  hazard  to personnel in exposed facilities out to distances well beyond the IBD arc. 4.10.2.  Glass  breakage  risk  assessments  determine  the  extent  of  this  hazard,  and  identify potential  mitigation  techniques,  to  reduce  the  hazard  to  an  acceptable  level.  If  the  hazard cannot be reduced to an acceptable level, the glass breakage risk assessment can be used to ensure the approving authority makes an informed risk acceptance decision. 4.11.  Requirements for Performance of Glass Breakage Risk Assessments. 4.11.1.  Glass breakage risk assessments, performed IAW paragraph 4.12., are required as follows: 4.11.1.1.  For modification of an existing occupied facility within an IBD arc as described in paragraph 5.2.2. (T-1). 74 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 4.11.1.2.  For  modified  operations  in  an  existing  occupied  facility  (when  acting  as  an exposure) within an IBD arc. When the risk assessment reveals a hazard to personnel, use engineering  mitigation  actions,  if  feasible,  to  eliminate  the  hazard  or  reduce  it  to  an acceptable level. Remaining risk must be accepted by the responsible Commander (see paragraph 4.13.). (T-1). 4.11.1.3.  For  existing  occupied  facilities  (when  acting  as  an  exposure)  within  the proposed  IBD  arc  of  a  new  PES.    If  the  risk  assessment  shows  there  is  a  hazard  to personnel,  use  engineering  mitigation  actions,  if  feasible,  to  eliminate  the  hazard  or reduce  it  to  an  acceptable  level.  Remaining  risk  must  be  accepted  by  the  responsible Commander (see paragraph 4.13.). (T-1). 4.11.1.4.  For existing occupied facilities (when acting as an exposure) within the IBD arc of an existing PES where modified operations increase the explosive hazard of the PES.  If the risk assessment shows there is a hazard to personnel, use engineering mitigation actions, if feasible, to eliminate or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level.  Remaining risk must be accepted by the responsible Commander (see paragraph 4.13.). (T-1). 4.11.1.5.  For new occupied facilities located within the IBD arc of any existing PES. 4.11.2.  Glass breakage risk assessments are recommended in the following situations: 4.11.2.1.  As a baseline assessment for all existing occupied buildings within an existing IBD arc. 4.11.2.2.  As  a  baseline  assessment  for  all  existing  occupied  buildings  of  a  sensitive nature (e.g., schools, off-base buildings, on-base buildings with significant public access such as a commissary, buildings with large amounts of glass panels, etc.) inside or near IBD arcs. 4.12.  Methodology for Glass Breakage Risk Assessments. 4.12.1.  The tool(s) selected for performing a glass breakage risk assessments are based on the  intent  of  the  analysis.    If  the  intent  is  to  demonstrate  windows  will  not  break  due  to design,  placement,  or  treatment,  then  a  detailed  software  based  assessment  is  required.    If however,  the  intent  is  to  only  demonstrate  a  hazard  exists  and  injuries  are  possible,  the information found in Chapter 2 of this Manual may be sufficient for obtaining information to support responsible Commanders risk acceptance. 4.12.2.  Glass breakage risk assessments identify the risk to personnel from glass breakage and, if necessary, evaluate the effect of engineering mitigation actions to reduce the risk to an acceptable level.  Protection level “Medium” as defined in United Facilities Criteria (UFC) 4-010-01,  DoD  Minimum  Antiterrorism  Standards  for  Buildings,  is  considered  acceptable levels of protection (see paragraph 4.13.). 4.12.3.  Glass breakage risk assessments must: 4.12.3.1.  Consider the presence and distance of personnel from glass panels. 4.12.3.2.  Evaluate the worst case event likely to expose glass panels to blast hazards. (T-1).    Glass  panels  that  are  exposed  to  multiple  explosives  facilities  would  necessitate evaluation only for the explosives facility that would place the maximum blast loading on AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 75 the glass panels.  Blast loading from HD 1.2.1 AE is based on the MCE.  Blast loading from HD 1.2.3 AE will be based on the NEWQD of the largest single round. 4.12.3.3.  Show the anticipated blast loading (i.e., the facility producing the blast loading, the  actual  separation  distance,  what  HD  and  NEWQD  produces  the  blast  loading,  and what the glass panel parameters (type, size, pane thickness) are) (T-1). 4.12.3.4.  Identify  engineering  actions  taken  to  mitigate  the  hazards  to  personnel  from glass breakage. 4.13.  Engineering  Mitigation  Actions  for  Reducing  or  Eliminating  Glass  Breakage Hazards to Personnel. 4.13.1.  Minimize the number and size of glass panels. (T-1). 4.13.2.  Orient the exposed facility to minimize blast loads on glass panels. (T-1). 4.13.3.  Minimize  or  remove  glass  panels  on  the  side  of  facilities  facing  the  explosives facilities. (T-1). 4.13.4.  Use tempered glass that breaks into small pieces with rounded edges. (T-1). 4.13.5.  Use glazing, anti-shatter films, or net/blast curtains. (T-1).  Where films are used, the base fire department notes this type construction on pre-fire plans to facilitate fire-fighting personnel entry in emergency situations. Section 4E—Health Hazard and Environmental Assessments 4.14.  Health Hazard Assessments. 4.14.1.  Using  organizations  must  ensure  Bioenvironmental  Engineering  (BE)  conducts  a health  hazard  assessment  of  the  work  area  and  operation  when  dust  or  concentrations  of vapors, fumes, or gases from explosives, equipment, or other chemicals in the work area are present. (T-1). 4.14.2.  The  squadron  Commander  must  accept  bioenvironmental  assessment  risks  before operations may begin. (T-1). 4.15.  Environmental Assessments.  Using organizations must ensure each explosives operation is evaluated for compliance with environmental standards. (T-1).  Include all hazardous wastes generated  during  all  phases  of  the  operation  in  the  evaluation.    Identify  requirements  for  the control, storage, and disposition of hazardous wastes in written procedures. Section 4F—Protection Principles 4.16.  Protective  Shielding  and  Remotely  Controlled  Operations.  This  paragraph  does  not apply to rod and gun club operations. 4.16.1.  Equipment  specialists  will  perform  a  risk  assessment  to  determine  if  an  operation requires protective shielding and must be remotely controlled for personnel protection. (T-1).  Specify shielding and remote control requirements in the item TO. (T-1).  As a minimum, personnel must use protective shielding when test procedures cannot ensure explosives are totally  isolated  and  protected  from  potentially  harmful  environments  such  as  electrical current  or  heat.  (T-1).    Operations  such  as  continuity  checks  of  electrically  actuated 76 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 explosives  devices,  propellant  cutting,  explosives  component  assembly,  modification,  or disassembly and demilitarization may require shielding or be  accomplished from a remote controlled location. 4.16.2.  When  a  risk  assessment  indicates  that  there  is  an  unacceptable  risk  from  an accidental  explosion  or  a  flash  fire,  Commanders  will  ensure  personnel  are  provided protection from blast, fragments and thermal effects, to include respiratory and circulatory hazards (T-1), as follows: 4.16.2.1.  Personnel protection must limit incident blast overpressure to 2.3 psi, fragments to energies of less than 58 ft-lb, and thermal fluxes to 0.3 calories per square centimeter per second. (T-1). 4.16.2.2.  K24  distance  provides  the  required  level  of  protection  for  blast  and  thermal effects only. for 4.16.2.3.  Shields Ammunition  Operations,  Criteria  for  Design  and  Tests  for  Acceptance,  provide acceptable protection for blast, thermal and fragment effects. that  comply  with  MIL-STD-398A,  Shields,  Operational 4.16.3.  The use of protective shielding or remotely controlled operations must be approved as part of the ESP. (T-1). (see paragraph 14.16.3.). 4.16.4.  The TO managing agency must ensure safe design and testing of specific protective devices when required by a TO.  Test for a 25 percent overload and obtain approval from the Nonnuclear Munitions Safety Board (NNMSB). (T-1). 4.16.5.  When  a  using  command  establishes  a  requirement  for  protective  devices,  that command must ensure that these devices are of a safe design.  Test for a 25 percent overload. (T-1). Note:  Shields that comply with MIL-STD-398A provide acceptable protection. 4.17.  Intentional  Ignition  or  Initiation  of  AE.  At  operations  (e.g.,  function,  proof,  lot acceptance  testing)  where  intentional  ignition  or  initiation  of  AE  is  conducted  (except  EOD operational responses), the following requirements apply: 4.17.1.  Operating  personnel  protection  will  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  4.16.2.1. (T-1). 4.17.1.1.  Contain or defeat all fragments. (T-1). 4.17.1.2.  Limit  thermal  flux  to  “Q”  (calories/square  centimeter/second)  =  0.62t-0.7423 where “t” is the time in seconds that a person is exposed to the radiant heat. (T-1). 4.17.1.3.  Comply with testing requirements of paragraph 4.16.4 or  4.16.5. (T-1). 4.17.1.4.  Limit  overpressure  levels  in  personnel-occupied  areas  to  satisfy  MIL-STD-1474E, Department of Defense Design Criteria Standard: Noise Limits. (T-0). 4.17.2.  The use of protective shielding must be approved as part of the ESP (see paragraph 14.16.3.). (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 77 4.17.3.  Areas used for intentional detonations meet the requirements of paragraphs  4.17.1. through    4.17.3.  for  protection  of  essential  personnel  provided  the  QD  requirements  of paragraph 12.72.4.1. are met. 4.17.4.  EOD  proficiency  training  ranges  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraphs  4.17.1. through    4.17.3  for  protection  of  essential  personnel  provided  the  QD  requirements  of paragraph 12.74. are met. 4.17.5.  Static  test  firing  of  propellant-loaded  items  must  meet  the  requirements  of paragraph 4.16.2.1. for protection of operating personnel. (T-1). 4.18.  Protective Measures.  Personnel protection may be increased by: 4.18.1.  Eliminating or establishing positive control of ignition and initiation stimuli. 4.18.2.  Using sufficient distance or barricades to protect from blast or fragments. 4.18.3.  Using  SDWs  or  properly  rated  fire  walls  to  protect  from  fragment  or  thermal hazards. 4.18.4.  UFC  3-340-02,  Structures  to  Resist  the  Effects  of  Accidental  Explosions,  contains design  procedures  to  achieve  personnel  protection,  protect  facilities  and  equipment,  and prevent propagation of explosions. 4.18.5.  Using  fire  detection  and  extinguishing  systems  (e.g.,  infra-red  actuated  deluge system)  in  those  areas  where  exposed,  thermally  energetic  materials  that  have  a  high probability of ignition and a large thermal output are handled.  Such systems must maximize the  speed  of  detection,  have  adequate  capacity  to  extinguish  potential  flash  fires  in  their incipient state, and maximize the speed of the application of the extinguishing agent. 4.18.6.  Using thermal shielding between the thermal source and personnel in AE operational areas, where it is essential for personnel to be present and the risk assessment indicates that an in-process thermal hazard exists.  Any shielding used must comply with MIL-STD-398A. (T-0).    When  shielding is  either  not  possible  or  inadequate,  to  include  a  failure  to  protect exposed personnel's respiratory and circulatory systems, augmentation with improved facility engineering design and personal protective clothing and equipment may be necessary. 4.18.7.  Using  thermal  protective  clothing  that  is  capable  of  limiting  bodily  injury  to  first degree  burns  (0.3  calories  per  square  centimeter  per  second)  with  personnel  taking turningevasive  action,  when  the  maximum  quantity  of  combustible  material  used  in  the operation is ignited. 4.18.8.  Using  protective  clothing  capable  of  providing  respiratory  protection  from  the inhalation  of  hot  vapors  or  any  toxicological  effects,  when  the  risk  assessment  indicates adverse effects would be encountered from the inhalation of combustion products. 4.19.  Emergency Operations. 4.19.1.  If  an  immediately  dangerous  explosive  situation  is  encountered,  shut  down  all operations  in  the  immediate  vicinity,  evacuate  personnel  to  a  safe  location,  and  call  EOD personnel  to  analyze  and  eliminate  the  hazard.  (T-1).    Do  not  resume  operations  until  the hazard has been eliminated, removed, or otherwise determined to be safe by EOD personnel.   (T-1). 78 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 4.19.2.  Make pre-planned arrangements for emergency measures such as bomb threats, hung flares, ground burst simulators, etc. on installations without on-site EOD support.  Coordinate these arrangements with MAJCOM Safety, EOD Functional Staff, Air Force Installation and Mission Support Center Detachment. 4.19.3.  Locations  used  repeatedly  for  the  emergency  destruction  of  recovered  military ordnance or hazardous explosive devices must have risk assessments pre-established and on file. (T-1). 4.19.4.  Emergency destruction operations conducted at reduced QD ranges and non-standard destruction sites (e.g., EOD proficiency  ranges  or non-sited remote locations) may  require the use of protective measures to limit fragmentation hazards.  When the time and situation allows,  emergency  responders  will  use  applicable  technical  data  (e.g.,  Automated  EOD Publication System (AEODPS), EOD Tactical Decision Aid, and DDESB Technical Paper 16) to apply protective measures. (T-1).  Construction may increase acceptable time lines, and place essential personnel at increased risk, but through ORM, the benefit of protective measures could outweigh the cost of no construction at all. Figure 4.1.  5-Step Risk Management Process. Notes:  1.  Step 1:  Identify the Hazards: Step one of the RM process involves application of appropriate hazard identification techniques in order to identify hazards associated with the operation or  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 79 activity. Hazards can be defined as any real or potential condition that can cause mission degradation; injury, illness, death to personnel or damage to or loss of equipment/ property.  2.  Step 2:  Assess the Hazards: The assessment step involves the application of quantitative and/or qualitative measures to determine the probability and severity of negative effects that may result from exposure to hazards/risks and directly affect mission or activity success. This process can be formalized or intuitive. 3.  Step 3:  Develop Controls & Make Decisions: Step three involves the development and selection of specific strategies and controls that reduce or eliminate risk. Effective mitigation measures reduce one of the three components (Probability, Severity or Exposure) of risk. Risk mitigation decisions must be made at the appropriate level for the identified risk. The higher the risk, the higher the decision-level needs to be to ensure that an appropriate analysis of overall costs to benefits has been carefully weighed. Keep in mind there is no “cookie-cutter” approach or specific standard for establishing levels of RM decision authority across the Air Force. However, it is critical that leadership/decision makers ensure that the levels of decision authority are aligned appropriately for mission requirements and experience levels of the personnel conducting operations/activities under their responsibility. It is possible for decision-levels to vary within a command for differing operations/activities if training requirements, mission sets or activities are divergent enough to warrant separate standards (i.e., AETC, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), etc.). Decision makers must ultimately choose the most mission supportive risk controls, consistent with RM principles that provide the best solution for the given hazards. Risk decisions must never be delegated to a lower level for convenience or when the situation dictates senior-level involvement; exceptions may be considered in time-critical situations where delays might endanger lives, resources or equipment. 4.  Step 4:  Implement Controls: Once control measures have been selected, an implementation strategy must be developed and carried out. The strategy must identify the: who, what, when, where and cost(s) associated with the control measure. For mission-related controls, accountability must be emphasized across all levels of leadership and personnel associated with the action so that there is clear understanding of the risks and responsibilities of Commanders and subordinates alike. There must always be accountability for acceptance of risk regardless of circumstances. 5.  Step 5:  Supervise & Evaluate: The RM process continues throughout the life cycle of the system, mission, or activity. Leaders and supervisors at every level must fulfill their respective roles to ensure controls are sustained over time. Once controls are in place, the process must be periodically reevaluated to ensure controls remain effective and mission supportive over time.

Applicability. 5.1.1.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  design  requirements  in  this  Chapter  apply  to  all existing and new construction of explosives facilities, to include specific explosives facility designs  covered  in  Chapter  6.    Unless  specifically  excluded,  the  requirements  in  this Chapter apply to licensed explosives storage locations and to locations involving explosives operations not0 requiring explosives siting.  This Chapter also provides requirements for the construction, maintenance, and repair of explosives facilities as well as equipment in these facilities. 5.1.2.  This Chapter does not address extraordinarily hazardous situations (e.g., nitroglycerin manufacturing) that require special consideration and design features.  In these situations, the MAJCOM develops specific design criteria. 5.1.3.  Additional  criteria  specific  to  nuclear  weapons  storage,  handling,  and  maintenance facilities apply as provided in AFMAN 91-118, Safety Design and Evaluation Criteria for Nuclear Weapon Systems. Section 5B—Glass Panels 5.2.  Glass Panels in Facilities Exposed to Explosives Hazards. 5.2.1.  For construction of a new occupied facility within an IBD arc, do not use glass panels unless deemed operationally necessary.  If the use of glass panels is deemed operationally necessary, comply with the following requirements, or process a deviation IAW paragraph 1.4. 5.2.1.1.  Design the panels so that they do not break under the expected blast loading; the framing and sash of such panels must be of sufficient strength to retain the panel in the structure under the expected blast loading.  Or, design the panels so that they withstand the same blast loading as the structure; the framing and sash of such panels must be of sufficient strength to retain the panel until the point of structural failure. 5.2.1.2.  Provide engineering analyses and design details, as part of the ESP package, to demonstrate  compliance  with  paragraph  5.2.1.1.    The  analyses  must  include  the information addressed in paragraphs 4.13.2. and  4.13.3. 5.2.2.  For modification of an existing occupied facility within an IBD arc, remove existing glass panels, if practical, as part of the scope of modification.  Do not add glass panels unless deemed operationally necessary.  If existing glass panels are not removed, perform a glass breakage risk assessment (see paragraph 4.13.).  If the risk assessment shows there will be a hazard to personnel, use engineering mitigation actions to eliminate the hazard or process a deviation  IAW  paragraph  1.4  (see  paragraph  4.14.).    If  the  addition  of  glass  panels  is AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 81 deemed operationally necessary, comply with paragraphs 5.2.1.1. and  5.2.1.2. or process a deviation IAW paragraph 1.4. 5.2.3.  Existing glass panels that are replaced due to damage (i.e., cracked or broken) must be replaced with equivalent strength or stronger glass panels. 5.2.4.  Glass skylights will not be used in any facility within an IBD arc. Section 5C—Hazardous Locations 5.3.  Hazardous  Locations.  Comply  with  National  Fire  Protection  Association  (NFPA)  70, National  Electrical  Code  (NEC),  Article  500,  Hazardous  (Classified)  Locations,  requirements for  the  design  and  installation  of  electrical  equipment  and  wiring  for  hazardous  locations.  Hazardous  locations  are  those  in  which  combustible  dusts,  flammable  vapors,  or  gases  are  or may be present in the air in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitable mixtures. 5.3.1.  The presence of explosives does not necessarily make an area a hazardous location.  To ensure proper identification of a hazardous location, it is necessary to have knowledge of the properties of the explosives involved, especially thermal stability and sensitivity to heat and spark.  Use NEC definitions of Class I, Division 1 and Class II, Division 1, as modified below, for explosives applications. 5.3.1.1.  Areas  containing  explosives  dusts  or  explosives  that  may,  through  handling, produce dust capable of being dispersed in the atmosphere shall be regarded as Class II, Division 1. 5.3.1.2.  Areas where explosive sublimation or condensation may occur are regarded as both Class I, Division 1 and Class II, Division 1. 5.3.2.  Some  definitive  drawings  for  explosives  facilities  may  identify  the  presence  of  a hazardous  location  or  require  the  installation  of  certain  basic  electrical  equipment  to  meet NEC requirements. 5.4.  Electrical Equipment in Hazardous Locations. 5.4.1.  Installation  of  electrical  equipment  in  hazardous  locations  involving  explosives  will comply  with  NEC  requirements  for  the  appropriate  hazardous  location  class,  group  and division. (T-1). 5.4.2.  Equipment  must  be  approved  not  only  for  the  class  of  location,  but  also  for  the explosion properties of the specific gas, vapor, or dust that will be present. (T-1). 5.4.3.  Intrinsically safe equipment must be certified by a reputable testing organization such as  Underwriters  Laboratories  (UL).  (T-1).    Such  equipment  must  be  used  IAW  the recommended environmental and operational conditions specified in the certification. (T-1). 5.4.4.  If  the  properties  of  an  explosive  are  such  that  the  NEC  requirements  for  electrical equipment  provide  inadequate  protection  under  prevailing  conditions,  use  of  any  of  the following approaches is acceptable: 5.4.4.1.  Intrinsically safe equipment. 5.4.4.2.  Purged or pressurized and suitably temperature-limited equipment. 5.4.4.3.  Exclusion of electrical equipment from the hazardous atmosphere. 82 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.4.4.4.  Isolation of equipment from the hazardous atmosphere by means of dust, vapor, or gas-free enclosures with surface temperatures positively maintained at safe levels. 5.4.5.  Devices providing “cold light” through chemical action are acceptable for use in any hazardous location. 5.5.  Interior Surfaces in Class II Hazardous Locations. 5.5.1.  Interior  surfaces  should  be  smooth,  free  from  cracks  and  crevices,  and  have  joints taped or sealed. 5.5.2.  If painted, interior surfaces should be covered with  a hard  gloss paint that is easily cleaned. 5.5.3.  Horizontal  ledges  possibly  holding  dust  will  be  avoided  or  beveled  to  prevent  dust collection. 5.5.4.  Cove bases at the junction of the walls and floor are recommended. 5.6.  Hardware  in  Hazardous  Locations.  To reduce the risk of accidental ignition by spark, consider  the  operational  conditions  in  any  hazardous  location  before  choosing  and  installing hardware.    Certain  hazards  may  be  sufficient  to  warrant  the  use  of  materials  that  reduce  the possibility of sparking. 5.7.  Static  Electricity  in  Hazardous  Locations.  To  minimize  the  risk  of  ignition  of  a flammable  or  combustible  atmosphere  in  a  hazardous  location  due  to  static  electricity,  the requirements of Section 5E are met for all hazardous locations. 5.8.  Ventilation  in  Hazardous  Locations.  Buildings  with  hazardous  locations  must  comply with the following ventilation requirements: 5.8.1.  Buildings where dust, fumes, or vapors (having explosive potential) are formed will be passively ventilated, usually at the source of the hazard. (T-1). 5.8.2.  Design  ventilation  systems  so  that  they  have  adequate  measures  for  minimizing (eliminating) static discharge, including measures applied during the activation of Manual or automated ventilation systems. (T-1). 5.8.3.  Equip exhaust fans where combustible dust or flammable vapors pass with nonferrous blades (or casting lined with nonferrous material) and approved motors. (T-1). 5.8.4.  Electrically bond and properly ground the entire ventilation system. (T-1). 5.8.5.  NFPA 91, Standard for Exhaust Systems for Air Conveying of Vapors, Gases, Mists, and Noncombustible Particulate Solids, may be used in the installation of such systems. 5.8.6.  For  buildings  containing  explosive  dust,  an  air  balance  that  gives  a  slight  negative pressure within the building is required. (T-1). 5.8.7.  If  air  conditioning  equipment  is  installed,  it  must  be  done  per  the  NFPA  90A, Standard  for  Installation  of  Air-Conditioning  and  Ventilating  Systems,  and  NFPA  90B, Standard for Installation of Warm Air Heating and Air-Conditioning Systems. (T-1).  Clean exhaust systems thoroughly and service on a regular schedule. (T-1).  Keep an activity log. (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Section 5D—Electric Supply Systems 83 5.9.  Electric  Supply  Systems.  This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  licensed  explosives  storage locations and locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting.  For QD and  fire  protection  separation  requirements  between  explosives  facilities  and  electric  supply system  components  see  paragraph  12.82.    Install  electric  lines  serving  explosives  facilities, including  shielded  cabling,  power  cabling,  and  communication  lines  underground  in  metal conduit from a point at least 50 feet away from the facility. 5.9.1.  The  line  side  of  the  main  disconnecting  switch  or  circuit  breaker  must  have  surge suppression IAW UFC 3-520-01, Interior Electrical Systems, and any Engineering Technical letters issued specifically for explosives areas. (T-1). 5.9.2.  Surge  protection  must  be  included  for  all  incoming  conductors.  (T-1).    The  surge protection must include suppression at the entrance to the facility from each wire to ground.    (T-1).    All  other  metallic  utility  lines  and  pipes  must  be  electrically  connected  to  the structural steel of the building prior to entering the facility. (T-1). 5.10.  Backup Power.  An alternate source of power is required for explosives operations where the  lack  of  a  continuous  power  supply  may  cause  a  fire  or  explosion,  as  determined  by  risk assessment (see Chapter 4). Section 5E—Static Grounding and Bonding 5.11.  Areas  Requiring  Static  Grounding  and  Bonding  Systems.  See  Section  7D  for  static grounding and bonding requirements during specific operations.  Static grounding and bonding systems are required for: 5.11.1.  Hazardous locations (see Section 5C). 5.11.2.  Areas where EIDs are exposed. 5.11.3.  Areas where exposed explosives are handled. 5.11.4.  Areas where explosive components incorporating an electrical initiating system are undergoing  maintenance;  assembly  to,  or  disassembly  from,  an  all-up-round  (AUR) configuration; or electrical connection or disconnection. 5.11.5.  Areas  where  electrically  initiated  munitions  and  explosive  devices  are  undergoing maintenance  and  electrical  test  operations  and  the  responsible  engineering  function  has determined grounding is necessary.  This will usually be documented in the specific item TO or similar product (i.e. test data package). 5.11.6.  Areas  where  explosives  are  loaded  or  unloaded  on  aircraft  (unless  exempted  per paragraph 7.13.1. or  7.13.2.). 5.12.  Static Grounding and Bonding Requirements. 5.12.1.  The method generally used to eliminate or reduce the hazard from static electricity is to provide an electrically continuous path to ground via ground wire, cable, or strap. 5.12.1.1.  These  grounds  should  be  one  continuous  ground  wire,  cable  or  strap.    Short ground wires, cables, or straps should not be connected together to make a longer one. 84 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.12.1.2.  Each  ground  wire,  cable,  strap  must  be  connected  to  the  item  and  facility ground  individually.    Avoid  connecting  multiple  ground  wires,  cables,  or  straps  to another ground wire, cable or strap connecting mechanism (alligator clip, clamp, etc.). 5.12.2.  Static  grounding  bars  or  other  grounding  devices  may  be  appropriate  for  some operations (see paragraph 7.12.1.).  Such grounding bars or devices will be located at the entrance to or within the area where work will be performed. 5.12.3.  Wire used as a permanent static ground conductor must be large enough to withstand mechanical damage and must not be less than American Wire Gauge (AWG) No. 6 (or No. 8 for existing bonds), or a braided cable of equal resistance.  Wires used as static grounds for portable or movable equipment, or for temporary static bonding cables, will be large enough to  carry  the  expected  current  load  as  specified  in  the  item  technical  data,  but  will  not  be smaller than AWG No. 12 (3/32-inch cable). 5.12.4.  Static grounds will be bonded to the facility's grounding system.  Static grounds will not be made to telephone grounds; electrical conduit systems; gas, steam, hot water, or air lines; sprinkler systems; or air terminals of lightning protection systems (LPS) (connection to the “down wire” of the system at ground level is authorized). 5.12.5.  When  all  of  the  objects  are  conductive,  they  can  be  grounded  by  electrically connecting all parts to a common ground conductor. 5.12.6.  Partial grounding, or using conductors that are too weak or have too much resistance, may  increase  the  static  hazard  by  providing  opportunities  for  discharge  through  an uncontrolled path to ground. 5.12.7.  Electrical continuity may be broken by oil on bearings, paint, or rust at any contact point.  To get a continuous circuit, grounding straps must be used to bridge such locations. 5.12.8.  Equipment  in  contact  with  conductive  floors  or  tabletops  will  not  be  considered grounded. 5.12.9.  For  explosive  facilities,  shielded  cabling,  power  cabling,  and  communication  lines must run underground in metal conduit for at least 50 feet prior to entering the structure. (T-1).    All  other  metallic  utility  lines  and  pipes,  including  steam,  water,  and  air  conditioning lines must be bonded to the LPS just before they enter the building. (T-1). 5.12.10.  Do  not  place  electrically  energized  objects  or  tools  on  grounded  surfaces  where explosives operations are conducted.  If electrically energized objects or tools (heat sealers, heat  guns,  etc.)  are  required  for  the  operation,  place  these  objects  on  a  non-conductive surface  to  prevent  continuity  between  the  electrically  energized  object  or  tool  and  the grounded surface. 5.13.  Permanent Static Grounding Systems. 5.13.1.  A resistance of 25 Ohms or less is required from item connection to facility ground.  In  hazardous  locations,  resistance  to  ground  of  10,000  Ohms  or  less  for  equipment  static bonding straps is adequate to bleed off the static charges; continuity across bonds must be less than one Ohm. 5.13.2.  IAW AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems, give all permanent static grounding systems a  continuity  test  at  the  time  of  initial  installation  and  at  any  time  a  lack  of  continuity  is AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 85 suspected due to damage or corrosion. (T-1). A resistance reading of 25 Ohms or less must be  obtained.    (T-1).    Documentation  of  initial  and  recurring  testing  is  required.  (T-1).  Consider  equipment  (except  a  belt-driven  machine)  as  a  unit  in  testing  of  resistance  to ground. 5.13.3.  Hazardous locations: 5.13.3.1.  Ground all conductive parts of equipment IAW the NEC. 5.13.3.2.  Where the installation permits viewing, make a visual inspection of all static bonds  and  grounds  for  breaks  and  corroded  connections  before  starting  operations  on each day the equipment is to be used.  Test any suspected connections and bring them up to required standards before starting operations. 5.13.4.  In non-hazardous locations, visually inspect static bonding and grounding straps for breaks and corroded connections quarterly IAW AFI 32-1065.  Test suspect connections for continuity, bring up to required standards, and re-test before starting operations. 5.14.  Temporary Static Grounding or Bonding Cables. 5.14.1.  Perform a continuity test on temporary static grounding or bonding cables at the time of their initial placement into service. 5.14.2.  Prior  to  each  subsequent  use,  inspect  the  cable    for  any  evidence  of  corrosion  or damage. 5.14.2.1.  Replace the clamp if jaws are deformed, spring is weak, or other defect is noted that would prevent a good connection. 5.14.2.2.  Replace  the  cable  if  more  than  one  third  of  the  cable  strands  are  broken.  Deteriorated or damaged plastic coating does not affect electrical capability of cables. 5.14.2.3.  Perform a continuity test if a lack of continuity is suspected due to damage or corrosion or after any components have been replaced. 5.14.3.  A resistance of  10 Ohms or less is required from inside one of  the clamp jaws to inside the other clamp jaw. 5.14.4.  Documentation of continuity testing on temporary static grounding or bonding cables is not required. 5.15.  Static Grounding or Bonding Reels. 5.15.1.  Give  all  installed  static  discharge  reels  a  continuity  test  at  the  time  of  their  initial installation. 5.15.2.  Prior to each subsequent use, visually inspect the static discharge reel for security of mounting and evidence of any corrosion or damage.  Perform a continuity test if a lack of continuity  is  suspected  due  to  damage  or  corrosion  or  after  any  components  have  been replaced or repaired. 5.15.3.  A resistance reading of 10 Ohms or less is required from inside the clamp jaw to the frame the reel is mounted. 5.15.4.  Accomplish the test by extending the entire length of the cable. 86 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.15.5.  Documentation of continuity testing on temporary static grounding or bonding reels (or cables) is not required. 5.16.  Belting.  If  static  electricity  is  a  hazard,  use  non-static-producing  belting  having  a resistance  to  ground  not  exceeding  600,000  Ohms.    This  includes  belt-driven  compressors, conveyor  belts,  and  so  forth.    In  measuring  the  total  resistance  to  ground  for  belt-driven machinery, do not count the resistance of the belting. Section 5F—Conductive Floors 5.17.  Areas  Requiring  Conductive  Floors.  Conductive floors may be  required in hazardous locations and where certain exposed explosives and materials are sensitive (easily detonated or ignited) to the uncontrolled discharge of static electricity, and the requirements of Section 5E are deemed  inadequate  to  protect  from  the  hazards  of  static  electricity.    Dust-air  mixtures  of ammonium perchlorate, tetrytol, and dust of solid propellants are subject to static discharge and conductive flooring must be considered where they are present. 5.18.  Requirements for Conductive Floors. 5.18.1.  Conductive floors will be non-sparking. 5.18.2.  Conductive  floors  will  be  smooth,  free  from  cracks,  and  of  a  type  that  will  not develop surface separations, wrinkle, or buckle under operational loads. 5.18.3.  Where  washing  is  required,  conductive  floors  will  be  able  to  withstand  repeated applications of hot water and cleaners. 5.18.4.  Where conductive floors are required, table tops where exposed explosives or dusts are  encountered  must  be  conductive,  or  covered  with  a  conductive  material,  meeting  the same requirements as the conductive floor. 5.18.5.  In  small  areas,  conductive  mats  or  runners  can  be  suitable  in  lieu  of  conductive floors.  Personnel (except electricians performing system checks), in places where conductive floors  or  coverings  are  required  and  installed,  will  wear  conductive  footwear  (shoes  or grounding straps). 5.18.6.  Where  conductive  floors  are  required,  the  resistance  between  the  ground  and  the wearer will not exceed 1,000,000 Ohms; that is, the total resistance of conductive footwear on a person, plus the resistance of floor to ground.  Additionally, resistance between the floor and ground connections must not be less that 25,000 ohms. 5.19.  Testing and Maintenance of Conductive Floors. 5.19.1.  Test  conductive  floors  when  installed  to  ensure  that  design  specifications  are  met, and at intervals thereafter as prescribed in AFI 32-1065.  Do not use test instruments until all exposed  explosives  and  explosives  dusts,  gases  and  vapors  that  are  subject  to  possible ignition or initiation have been removed from the area. 5.19.2.  Do not paint over conductive floors. 5.20.  Testing and Maintenance of Conductive Footwear. 5.20.1.  Test conductive footwear before each shift. 5.20.2.  Conductive footwear requires care to ensure retention of its conductive properties. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 87 5.20.2.1.  Store conductive footwear in lockers close to the room where it will be worn and don conductive footwear at this same location. 5.20.2.2.  Take precautions to prevent the  accumulation of even  a thin layer of dust or wax which can insulate conductive footwear from the floor. 5.20.2.3.  Supervisors will ensure that conductive footwear is not altered so as to negate their safety features. 5.20.2.4.  Use  only  conductive  materials  in  the  repair  of  conductive  footwear.    Clean conductive footwear thoroughly before repair. Section 5G—Installed Systems and Equipment Grounds 5.21.  Installed Systems and Equipment Grounds.  Pay special attention to the installation and maintenance  of  electrical  grounding  where  explosives  are  involved  in  accordance  with  the following: 5.21.1.  Bond all grounding mediums together. 5.21.2.  If the structure is equipped with an  LPS, interconnect all  grounds, including static grounds, as outlined in AFI 32-1065. 5.21.3.  Test  grounding  when  installed  to  ensure  that  design  specifications  are  met  and  at intervals  thereafter  as  prescribed  in  AFI  32-1065.    Document  all  tests  and  inspections  on appropriate forms or automated products. 5.21.3.1.  Before  making  any  electrical  continuity  and  resistance  tests  or  electrical repairs, remove all exposed explosives, EIDs, and explosives dust, gases and vapors that are subject to initiation under the specific circumstances. 5.21.3.2.  If  there  is  an  operating  generator  or  energized  transformer  at  the  location, connect  a  shunt  grounding  strap  before  opening  an  installed  grounding  connection  for repair or replacement. Section 5H—Lightning Protection Systems 5.22.  Facilities  Requiring  LPS.  Properly  maintained  LPS  are  required  for  all  explosives facilities (to include open locations), except as noted in paragraph 5.25.  The DoD has selected the LPS criteria of NFPA 780, Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems, for AE facilities.  If LPS test methods or designs are used, other than prescribed in this section, they must offer equivalent protection to those prescribed in this section and be approved via the ESP.  DoDM 3150.02, DoD Nuclear Weapon System Safety Program Manual, and AFI 91-100 series Weapons System Safety Rules provide LPS program guidance for nuclear weapons facilities and operations. 5.23.  LPS Design.  LPS design and installation must, at a minimum, meet the requirements of AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems and NFPA 780.  The LPS must feature air terminals, down conductors,  sideflash  protection,  surge  suppression  of  data  lines  and  bonding  of  all  other conductive penetrations into the protected area, and earth electrode systems.  Structural elements of the building may serve as air terminals, down conductors, or the earth electrode.  Design the LPS to intercept lightning at 100 feet or less striking distance arc IAW NFPA 780.  The Base 88 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Civil  Engineer  ensures  any  changes  to  LPS  design  and  installation,  grounding,  or  surge suppression is reflected in as-built electrical drawings. (T-1).  Note:  The pitched roof requirements of NFPA 780 may not be used in lieu of this requirement. 5.23.1.  Air  Terminals.    An  air  terminal  is  a  component  of  an  LPS  that  is  able  to  safely intercept  lightning  strikes.    Air  terminals  may  include  overhead  wires  or  grids,  vertical spikes, or a building’s grounded structural elements.  Air terminals must be capable of safely conducting the current from a lighting strike. 5.23.2.  Down Conductors.  Down conductors (flat or round) provide low impedance paths from  the  air  terminals  described  above  to  the  earth  electrode  (ground)  system.    Structural elements  having  a  high  current  capacity  and  low  impedance  to  ground  need  not  be augmented  with  wires.    Where  wires  are  used  as  down  conductors,  they  must  meet  the requirements listed in NFPA 780. 5.23.3.  General  Sideflash  Protection.    Protection  from  side  flash  is  obtained  either  by bonding metallic objects to the down conductors or the earth electrode system, IAW NFPA 780, except as modified herein, or it is obtained by maintaining a separation distance between metallic objects and these LPS components. 5.23.3.1.  Bond fences and railroad tracks located within six feet of a structure’s LPS to the structure’s LPS. 5.23.3.2.  The reinforcing bars in adjacent structural elements must be joined in a manner to provide electrical bonding between the elements.  This is an absolute requirement for facilities  that  are  used  to  store  AE.    Techniques  commonly  used  and  approved  in  the construction industry to join reinforcing steel are acceptable for this purpose.  The steel arch of an ECM must be similarly joined to the rebar in the floor. 5.23.4.  Sideflash  Protection  for  Nuclear  Weapons.    The  Nuclear  Weapon  System  Safety Group (NWSSG) adopted a standard sideflash separation distance value of seven-feet as a conservative baseline for nuclear safety critical operations.   In the absence of any specific additional guidance due  to location or weapon configuration, the 7-foot  value must be the sideflash  separation  distance  required  (see  paragraph  5.23.4.2.  and  Table  5.1.).    When weapons are in an operational configuration where no lightning sideflash separation distance is  required,  all  other  separation  distance  requirements  not  specifically  related  to  lightning (i.e., for access, ventilation, inventory, etc.) are still applicable. 5.23.4.1.  The  sideflash  protection  requirements  for  all  nuclear  weapons,  depending  on their operational configuration, are listed in Table 5.1.  The term “major maintenance” refers to the weapon configuration resulting from the disassembly or the performance of any maintenance operations, as currently approved, which could result in exposure of the weapon’s internal components to electrical energy.  Major maintenance does not include Permissive Action Link (PAL) procedures. 5.23.4.2.  Location Considerations for Sideflash Separation Distance. 5.23.4.2.1.  If operations are being performed inside a hardened aircraft shelter (HAS) or  a  protective  aircraft  shelter  (PAS)  and  these  operations  include  weapon configurations that require a separation distance (see Table 5.1.), then: 5.23.4.2.1.1.  When  using  an  LPS  modified  Weapons  Maintenance  Truck AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 89 (WMT)/Secure  Transportable  Maintenance  System  (STMS),  no  minimum sideflash  separation  distance  is  required  between  the  WMT/STMS  and  the HAS/PAS  provided  all  additional  safety  requirements  are  adhered  to  IAW  TO 11N-50-1007,  Transportation  Maintenance  System  Operator/User  Manual A/S32U-42  and  A/S32U-43  and  TO  11N-50-1010-1,  Secure  Transportable Maintenance  System,  Operator/User  Manual,  A/M32U-22, including  any separation distance requirements between the weapon and the inside walls of the WMT/STMS.    (See  paragraph  5.23.4.3.  for  proper  application  of  separation distance). 5.23.4.2.1.2.  When  no  WMT/STMS  is  being  used,  a  minimum  sideflash separation  distance  of  seven-feet  is  required  between  the  weapon  and  the HAS/PAS.    See  paragraph  5.23.4.3.  for  proper  application  of  separation distance. 5.23.4.2.2.  If operations are being performed at any location other than in a HAS or a PAS  and  these  operations  include  weapon  configurations  that  require  a  separation distance,  then  a  minimum  sideflash  separation  distance  of  seven-feet  is  required between the weapon and facility (see paragraph 5.23.4.3. and Table 5.1. for proper application of separation distance). 5.23.4.2.3.  The  standard  separation  distance  of  seven-feet  may  be  reduced  by determining the specific sideflash separation value for a particular facility. 5.23.4.2.3.1.  Sideflash separation distance  reduction is based on  Faraday  shield impedance  characterization  testing  and  the  adequate  bonding  and  appropriate installation of surge suppression using a methodology approved by AFSEC/SEW prior to implementation. 5.23.4.2.3.2.  Documentation of the bonding and surge suppression configuration, including the associated separation distance calculations, in an attachment to the ESP,  must  accompany  the  characterization  test  results  for  formal  review  and approval by AFSEC/SEW before an exception to the 7-foot standard separation distance  is  granted.  (T-1).    Changes  to  the  bonding  and  surge  suppression configuration  must  be  submitted  to  AFSEC/SEW  for  approval  prior  to implementation. (T-1). 5.23.4.2.3.3.  Faraday shield characterization and implementation methodologies must include specific maintenance and inspection procedures and comply with the following requirements (see AFI 32-1065, Grounding Systems): 5.23.4.2.3.3.1.  Visually  inspect  bonds  and  surge  suppressors  as  a  minimum every  six  months  to  validate  the  installation  and  serviceability.  (T-1).  Additionally,  perform  a  visual  inspection  of  all  surge  suppression  devices when a lightning strike occurs to the facility. (T-1). 5.23.4.2.3.3.2.  Take  electrical  resistance  measurements  of  bonds,  as  a minimum, once every two years. (T-1).  Such measurements are also required when the facility is subjected to an earthquake, tornado, flood, or other such acts of nature that could have affected the integrity of the bonds; and any time modification, maintenance or repair to the structure, penetration or any LPS 90 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 component requires the bond or connection to be broken.  The bond resistance must be less than one Ohm.  Larger readings require tightening or reattaching of the bonds. 5.23.4.2.3.3.3.  Take  transfer  impedance  measurements,  as  determined  by Faraday  shielding  characterization  testing,  as  a  minimum,  once  every  10 years. (T-1). 5.23.4.2.3.3.4.  Maintain  a  record  of  all  resistance  or  transfer  impedance measurements at all required points and of visual inspections for at least six inspection and testing cycles IAW AFI 32-1065. (T-1). 5.23.4.2.3.4.  The  measures  taken  to  implement  a  Faraday  shield  approach  for reducing the required lightning sideflash separation distance in a particular facility do  not  impact,  adversely  affect  or  relieve  the  requirements  to  maintain  a conventional LPS as described in Section 5H and the current version of AFI 32-1065. 5.23.4.3.  The  required  safe  separation  distance  (SSD)  is  properly  applied  to  an  item (weapon, WMT/STMS, etc.) to be protected from lightning sideflash by maintaining  a minimum  free  space  separation  of  the  specified  distance  between  the  item  and  the facility’s walls, ceiling, or any other structural member capable of conducting electrical energy (e.g., steel columns, rebar-reinforced interior walls, columns or beams). 5.23.4.3.1.  Objects in the floor such as concrete rebar, floor grounds, and structural members  of  the  Weapons  Storage  Vault  (WSV),  when  the  vault  is  in  a  full  down position, do not require the application of the sideflash separation distance. 5.23.4.3.2.  If an ungrounded metallic conductor is located within the SSD of the item being protected, then the shortest free space distance measured between the metallic conductor and any structural member capable of conducting electrical energy must be at least equal to the  full separation distance (seven-foot default) minus the shortest free  space  distance  measured  between  the  metallic  conductor  and  the  item  being protected. 5.23.4.3.3.  Transient or temporary infringement of the sideflash separation distance requirement (e.g., the movement of personnel through the facility or the requirement to use an overhead crane in the course of approved maintenance procedures) can be permitted.  Avoid these actions whenever possible or their duration will be minimized while still allowing required maintenance operations to be safely completed.  These violations are not justified by issues of convenience or for the sole purpose of ease of operations. 5.23.4.4.  Deviations  from  paragraph  5.23.4.  must  be  approved  by  AFSEC/SEW  (see paragraph 1.4.1.). (T-1). 5.23.5.  Surge  Protection  for  Incoming  Conductors.    Include  LPS  surge  protection  for  all incoming conductors.  The surge protection must include suppression at the entrance to the building  from  each  wire  to  ground.  (T-1).  Bury  shielded  cabling,  power  cabling,  and communication lines underground in metal conduit for a minimum of 50 feet before entering AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 91 the structure. (T-1).  All other metallic utility lines and pipes must be electrically connected to the LPS or the structural steel of the building just before they enter the building. (T-1). 5.23.6.  Earth  Electrode  System.    Earth  electrode  systems  dissipate  the  current  from  a lightning  strike  to  ground.    Earth  electrode  systems  may  be  concrete  encased  electrodes, ground  loop  conductors,  radials,  grounding  rods,  ground  plates,  a  conductor  immersed  in nearby salt water, chemical grounds that are installed for the purpose of providing electrical contact with the earth, or combinations of these. 5.23.7.  Underground  Storage  Facility.    An  underground  storage  site  requires  protection against lightning only for exposed or partially exposed parts.  Consider LPS requirements on a site specific basis. 5.24.  LPS  Inspection,  Maintenance,  Testing,  and  Training.  Ensure  that  LPS  meets,  at  a minimum, the requirements of AFI 32-1065.  Perform maintenance to ensure the integrity of the LPS conforms to AFI 32-1065. 5.24.1.  Visual inspection.  Periodically inspect the LPS IAW AFI 32-1065. 5.24.2.  Electrical tests.  Electrically test LPSs when placing a new facility into service and after any facility modification that may have affected the system. (T-1).  Perform electrical tests IAW AFI 32-1065. (T-1). 5.24.2.1.  A maximum resistance value of one Ohm is permitted across all bonds when conducting bonding (resistance) tests. 5.24.2.2.  The maximum resistance to earth must not exceed 25 ohms when conducting earth ground resistance tests unless a ground loop conductor is installed.  The resistance to ground of a ground loop system is acceptable even if greater than 25 ohms. 5.24.2.3.  Use  test  instruments  that  are  in  good  working  order  and  calibrated  IAW manufacturers’ recommendations. 5.24.3.  Records and  Data.  Keep records  and test measurement data of  resistance to earth tests and bonding on file for the last six inspection cycles. (T-1).  Review these records for trend analysis as prescribed in AFI 32-1065. (T-1). 5.24.4.  Training.    Personnel  who  design,  maintain,  repair,  modify,  and  test  LPS  and grounding  systems  must  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  test  equipment  operation;  lightning protection, grounding, and bonding theory and practices; referenced codes and standards; and specific requirements and procedures within AFI 32-1065. (T-1). 5.24.5.  Maintenance.  Perform maintenance to ensure that the integrity of the LPS conforms to the criteria contained in AFI 32-1065. (T-1). 5.25.  LPS Exceptions.  Properly maintained LPS are required for explosives facilities, with the following exceptions: 5.25.1.  Air terminal systems are not required on a HAS, a PAS, a metal aircraft shelter, or an earth covered magazine, provided: 5.25.1.1.  All reinforcing steel in the walls and floors are properly bonded and grounded. 5.25.1.2.  Metal ventilators at least 0.188 (3/16) inches thick are grounded. 92 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.25.1.3.  Metal  ventilators  less  than  0.188  (3/16)  inches  thick  are  protected  by  an  air terminal. 5.25.1.4.  Down  conductor,  sideflash  protection,  surge  suppression,  and  earth  electrode system requirements of paragraph 5.23. are met. 5.25.2.  A  LPS  is  not  required  for  licensed  explosives  storage  locations  and  for  locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting. Note: This exemption is made because of the explosives; other contents of the building may require a LPS. 5.25.3.  An “integral” LPS is not required for an all-metal building that has been shown to meet the additional criteria of a “metallic cage” system, as both are defined in NFPA 780.  This exception must be approved by AFSEC/SEW prior to operational use of the building in this configuration (see paragraph 1.4.). (T-1). 5.25.4.  The  following  locations  do  not  require  a  LPS  provided  that  the  responsible Commander accepts the loss of resources and structure and any potential collateral damage to other nearby exposures.  Commanders will ensure risk acceptance is documented by letter (i.e., signed by the Commander stating he/she understands and accepts the potential loss of resources and structures at the location without LPS and any potential collateral damage to other nearby exposures) and submitted with the ESP. (T-1). 5.25.4.1.  Explosives locations served by a local lightning warning system to permit the controlled termination of operations at the issuance of a lightning watch and immediate personnel  protection  actions  at  the  issuance  of  a  lightning  warning  as  prescribed  in Section 7H. 5.25.4.2.  Facilities  containing  only  AE  that  cannot  be  initiated  by  lightning,  as determined by AFSEC/SEW and approved by DDESB, and where no fire hazard exists. 5.25.4.3.  Facilities where personnel  are not  expected to sustain injury and at the same time,  the  resulting  economic  loss  of  the  structure,  its  contents  and/or  surrounding facilities is minimal. 5.25.4.4.  Facilities used for temporary (non-recurring) storage of munitions. 5.25.4.5.  Structures,  facilities,  or  mobile  equipment  housing  explosives  or  explosives operations not regularly situated at a fixed location. 5.25.4.6.  Structures  and  facilities  limited  to  the  storage  or  handling  of  small  arms ammunition where the value of the ammunition is $10,000 or less. 5.25.4.7.  LPS  may  be  omitted  on  EOD  intentional  detonation  and  proficiency  training ranges,  and  holding  areas  sited  within  the  range  boundary.    A  Commander’s  risk acceptance memorandum is not required.  Apply the requirements set forth in paragraph 5.25.4.1. 5.25.5.  LPS may also be omitted on flightline PESs if the system interferes with flightline criteria  contained  in  UFC  3-260-01,  Airfield  and  Heliport  Planning  and  Design.    A Commander’s risk acceptance is not required.  See Section 7H for procedures in the event of electrical storms. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 93 5.25.6.  Large catenary systems that cannot conform to the bonding distances calculated from the equations provided in AFI 32-1065 must be considered under the provision in paragraph 5.22.  Provide engineering analyses to ensure variances provide equivalent protection prior to submission to the DDESB for approval. 5.25.7.  ECMs  that  constitute  a  metallic  cage,  as  defined  in  NFPA  780,  and  that  do  not contain  any  energized  or  unbounded  metallic  penetrations,  do  not  require  earth  resistance testing. Section 5I—General Design Considerations for Explosives Facilities 5.26.  Blowout-type  Construction.  Roofs and walls of explosives facilities will be as light in weight  (weak)  as  practicable.    Design  facility  features  (e.g.,  roofs,  walls,  blow-out  panels)  to allow  venting  of  an  internal  explosion  with  the  minimum  number  of  large  fragments.    Avoid installing hardware (including pipes and ducts) on light blowout-type walls, roofs or panels; if unavoidable,  select  materials  or  items  that  will  not  yield  heavy  fragments  in  an  explosion.  Consider the use of frangible panels in the design of HD 1.3 facilities where high overpressures from  a  detonation  or  a  confined  deflagration  are  expected  (see  HNDED-CS-93-7,  Hazard Division  1.3  Passive  Structural  Systems  Design  Guide).    This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to licensed explosives storage locations. 5.27.  Non-combustible  Construction.  Construct  exterior  walls  and  roof  coverings  of explosives building out of non-combustible materials.  Use non-combustible material for interior surfaces of explosives buildings (see UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities.  If it is necessary to use combustion-supporting materials in the interior of an explosives building, treat or cover all exposed surfaces with fire-retardant material.  This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting. 5.28.  Underground  Explosives  Storage  Facilities.  All  wiring  and  electrical  equipment  in underground storage facilities will, in addition to any other requirements of this Chapter, be of moisture  and  corrosion  resistant  materials  and  construction  unless  a  site  specific  analysis indicates that such construction is not necessary.  Commanders will ensure underground facilities have  emergency  lighting  systems  to  provide  minimum  illumination  in  the  event  of  a  power failure. (T-1). 5.29.  Outdoor Explosives Storage Sites.  This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations and locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting. 5.29.1.  Outdoor explosives storage sites will have a minimal slope, be well drained, and free from unnecessary combustible materials. 5.29.2.  Adequate  dunnage  is  needed,  especially  between  the  stack  and  an  unimproved surface to ensure stack stability.  Build and place the dunnage, supporting timbers or platform where  explosives are stored to prevent falling, sagging, or shifting of the explosives.  See specific item TOs. 5.29.3.  Provide nonflammable or fire-resistant, waterproofed, overhead covers for packaged explosive  items  unless  the  item  is  contained  in  packing  designed  and  approved  for unprotected outside storage.  There must be at least 18 inches between the top of the stack 94 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 and  the  cover.      (T-1).    If  airspace  is  kept  between  the  cover  and  the  stacks,  the  sides  of covered stacks may be protected by nonflammable or fire-resistant, waterproof covers. 5.30.  Stairways.  Stairways  will  conform  to  Air  Force  Occupational  Safety  and  Health (AFOSH) standards, AFI 91-203, Air Force Consolidated Occupational Safety Instruction, and NFPA  101,  Life  Safety  Code  requirements.  (T-1).    Open-sided  stairways  in  an  explosives building (or in one where a dangerous fire hazard exists) must have handrails at least 42 inches high. (T-1).  They must have mid-railings to preclude falls when vision might be impaired by smoke, injury or when panic might result. (T-1).  Avoid open risers. 5.31.  Fixed Ladders.  Fixed ladders must conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Safety Code A14.3, Fixed Ladders, and AFI standards. (T-1).  5.32.  Platforms,  Runways,  and  Railings.  Platforms,  runways,  and  railings  must  conform  to AFI 91-203 requirements. (T-1). 5.32.1.  Platforms and runways less than 30 feet long require one stairway or fixed ladder.  Those over 30 feet long or more than 250 square feet in area require two stairways or ladders. (T-1). 5.32.2.  Platforms, floor openings, runways, tanks, or open vats comply with AFI 91-203. 5.32.3.  Permanent railings must be made of metal except in those process buildings where metal railings would increase the hazard. (T-1). 5.33.  Passageways.  If weather-protected passageways (ramps) are needed between buildings or magazines, they must have suitable fire stops between the buildings. 5.34.  Walkways.  Walkways  at  the  entrances  to  or  between  adjacent  operating  buildings containing  explosives  will  be  hard  surfaced  or  boardwalks.  (T-1).    Keep  these  walkways  free from  foreign  material.    Provide  foot  brushes,  door  mats,  or  scrapers  at  the  entrance  of  each building,  except  magazines.    Give  special  attention  to  passageways,  walkways,  and  stairs subjected to the effects of inclement weather. 5.35.  Roads.  This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  licensed  explosives  storage  locations,  and locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting, unless they are located within an explosives storage area. 5.35.1.  Provide good all-weather roads to, and within, the explosives area. 5.35.2.  Arrange road systems serving groups of magazines or explosives buildings without dead ends so that motor vehicles carrying explosives cannot be isolated.  To prevent dead ending,  interconnecting  roads  for  magazine  service  roads  need  only  be  passable  trails adequate to accommodate the typical vehicles used at the installation. 5.35.3.  Roads  serving  a  single  magazine  or  explosives  processing  building  (including  its service  facilities)  may  dead  end  at  the  magazine  or  building.    Design  the  road  system  to eliminate  the  need  for  passing  through  an  intermediate  explosives  area  when  traveling between one operating area and another, within the same explosives storage area. 5.36.  Gates.  There is no mandatory safety requirement for more than one personnel gate in the fence  around  an  explosives  area.    Weapons  Safety,  Security  and  Civil  Engineering  usually determine  how  many  gates  are  needed  after  considering  all  elements  of  the  situation.    Give consideration  to  providing  alternate  personnel  gates  for  a  single  event  emergency.    This AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 95 paragraph  does  not  apply  to  licensed  explosives  storage  locations,  and  locations  involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting.  Consider alternate ways of evacuating an explosives area based on where explosives events may occur. 5.37.  Drainage.  Provide  adequate  drainage  for  access  and  internal  roads  and  all  explosives locations.    Provide  magazines  with  condensation  drainage  from  the  storage  facility  interiors.  This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting. 5.38.  Drains  and  Sumps.  The  following  requirements  apply  to  facilities  handling  liquid explosives or liquids containing explosive waste: to  drying, interaction  with  other temperature  changes,  or 5.38.1.  When lines are required for draining liquid explosives or liquids containing explosive waste, they will be free of pockets and low spots. (T-1).  The drain line will be sloped at least one quarter inch per foot so that explosives will not settle in the drain line. (T-1).  The drain system will include a sump or basin so explosives can be removed. (T-1). 5.38.2.  Bolted sump tanks or other types of construction that allow the explosives to settle in obscure  or  hidden  spaces  are  prohibited.    Avoid  any  deposition  of  explosives  from  sump effluent  due industrial contamination.  Use sweeping and other dry-collecting measures to keep explosives which are appreciably soluble in water out of the drainage system. 5.38.3.  Design sumps so that suspended and solid explosive material that may settle cannot be carried in the wash waters beyond the sumps.  Construct sumps so the overflow does not disturb any floating solids.  The design will allow enough settling time, based on the settling rate of the material and the usual rate of flow.  It will allow the collected explosives to be removed  easily  and  allow  those  floating  on  the  water  to  be  retained  until  they  can  be skimmed from the water surface. 5.38.4.  In all new construction, drains between the source of explosives and the sump will be troughs  with  rounded  bottoms.  (T-1).    The  drains  will  have  removable,  non-sparking, ventilated  covers  for  ease  of  inspection  for  accumulated  explosives.  (T-1).    Waste  liquids will not be run into closed drains and sewers. 5.38.5.  Inspect  drains  periodically  and  take  steps  to  prevent  the  buildup  of  explosive deposits.  Do not connect drains and sewers containing explosive waste to the normal sewage systems.  All residues from hazardous material clean-up operations are considered hazardous waste  and  must  be  disposed  IAW  AFI  32-7086,  Hazardous  Materials  Management  and AFPD 32-30, Explosives Ordnance Disposal. (T-1). 5.39.  Tunnels.  Tunnels must be drained, ventilated, well lighted, and have at least two exits. (T-1).  Water and steam service lines in tunnels will be lagged with suitable insulation.  Tunnels between buildings that contain explosives will be built to resist the shock wave and blast of an explosion  (see  DoD  6055.09-M  for  design  guidance).  (T-1).    Only  authorized  personnel  will enter the tunnels. (T-1). 5.40.  Laundries.  Laundries  for  washing  uniforms  and  rags  that  are  contaminated  with explosives must comply with the following requirements: 5.40.1.  The  laundry  will  include  a  safe  place  to  store  uniforms  and  rags  that  are contaminated with explosives before washing. (T-1).  Sumps will also be provided to remove 96 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 explosives from waste water.  (T-1).  There must be facilities available to test whether the contaminant  (particularly  any  insoluble  toxic  substance)  has  been  removed.    Contact Environmental Management for assistance. 5.40.2.  Inform  commercial  businesses  laundering  such  articles  of  the  nature  of  the explosives contamination and possible dangerous chemical reactions. 5.41.  Steam for Explosives Processing or Facility Heating.  This paragraph does not apply to licensed explosives storage locations, and locations involving explosives operations not requiring explosives siting. 5.41.1.  Steam used to heat buildings that contain explosives must not exceed 228o F. (T-1). Process steam may exceed this if necessary but will not exceed 250o F.  (Process steam is steam  that  is  in  direct  contact  with  explosives  or  in  the  case  of  equipment  failure,  would exhaust  directly  into  contact  with  explosives  or  explosive  fumes.)    However,  for  TNT specifically, the maximum temperature allowed for processing is 240o F. 5.41.2.  Steam or hot water pipe surfaces in contact with wood, paper, or other combustible materials must never be hotter than 160o F. (T-1).  If the hot water pipes and the steam lines are  hotter  than  this,  they  must  be  covered  and  painted  with  an  impervious  material  or otherwise protected against direct or prolonged contact with these items. (T-1). 5.41.3.  Where a reducing valve is used, install a relief valve on the low pressure piping.  The production of superheated steam caused by the throttling action of reducing valves will be prevented by positive means, preferably by using a “water leg” or water column to control steam pressure of 5 psi or less. 5.41.4.  Where close control of steam temperature is needed, install indicating and recording pressure or temperature gauges.  Periodically test such devices and record the test results. 5.41.5.  Where  circulating  hot  water  is  used  for  heating,  the  installation  and  operating conditions will conform to AFI 32-1068, Heating Systems And Unfired Pressure Vessels. 5.41.6.  In  explosives  handling  or  storage  locations  where  resistance  to  ground  is  high, ground steam or hot water lines where they enter buildings. 5.41.7.  A hot work permit is required to use any equipment exceeding 228o F in a building containing explosives. (T-1). 5.42.  Magazine Ventilation and Vermin-Resistance. 5.42.1.  Provide  magazines  with  appropriate  means  of  air  circulation  or  dehumidification, when required by civil engineering, logistics, or health directives. Note:  Do not install ventilators in 3-bar or 7-bar rated earth-covered magazine designs unless allowed by the DDESB approved definitive design drawing to ensure the ECM’s strength rating is not affected.   5.42.2.  Magazine  vents  (when  installed  or  repaired)  must  prevent  the  entry  of  sparks  and burning embers, or have fusible links to close the vents when an outside fire threatens the magazine.    Where  fusible  links  are  installed,  leave  unpainted,  and  ensure  they  are serviceable,  properly  installed,  and  rated  for  a  maximum temperature  of  155o  F  to  165o  F (68.3o C to 73.8o C) NSN 4210-00-033-6032 or suitable substitute.  Existing magazine vents that do not prevent the entry of sparks and burning embers may  continue to be used until AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 97 repaired or replaced; however, it is strongly recommended that these vents be evaluated by civil  engineering  (base  fire  marshal  or  designate)  for  their  ability  to  prevent  the  entry  of sparks and burning embers. 5.42.3.  Provide  magazines  with  vermin  resistance,  when  required  by  civil  engineering, logistics, or health directives. Section 5J—Emergency Exits for Explosives Buildings 5.43.  General.  Use the ANSI Safety Code A156.3, Building Exits, and NFPA 101 as a guide in constructing emergency exits and fire escapes. 5.43.1.  Exterior  fire  escapes  from  a  building  with  two  or  more  stories  must  be  of  non-combustible  material  and  are  separated  from  the  interior  of  the  building  by  fire-resistant walls. 5.43.2.  Arrange fire escape stairs so they are exposed to the smallest number of window and door openings.  Protect all openings as required by the NFPA 101. 5.43.3.  Fire walls are designed to limit the spread of fire to only one zone of a facility.  They are normally extended through the roof of the building to prevent a fire on one side of the fire wall from immediately spreading to the remainder of the facility.  Construct proposed fire walls as prescribed in UFC 3-600-01, Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities.  Protect any openings through the fire wall as described in the NFPA 80, Standard for Fire Doors and Other Opening Protectives, and NFPA 221, Standard for Fire Walls and Fire Barrier Walls. 5.44.  Building Exits. 5.44.1.  One properly located  exit is suitable for small operating rooms  or cubicles having substantial dividing walls on three sides. 5.44.2.  In larger buildings or rooms, at least two exits remote from each other (regardless of dimensions), will be provided for each operating room or building containing explosives. (T-1). 5.44.3.  If more than eight persons are occupying a room containing explosives, have more than one exit or one exit for each multiple of five persons (or fraction thereof).  Coordinate with  the  installation’s  Ground  Safety  (SEG)  and  Fire  Marshall  for  the  number  of  exits required based on occupancy. 5.44.4.  Exits  must  be  at  least  32  inches  wide  by  80  inches  high.  (T-1).    However,  in determining the total number of exits required, available space (in multiples of 32 inches of width) may be considered additional exit units.  Space exits equally about the perimeter of the building.  Refer to NFPA 101, paragraph 7.2.1.2.3.2., for exceptions to the 32 inch width. 5.44.5.  Exits  must  be  IAW  requirements  outlined  in  NFPA  101.  (T-1).    Exits  must  lead directly outside. (T-1).  Plan each exit to avoid obstructing the escape of personnel.  Do not place explosives, equipment, and operating materials between personnel and exits. 5.45.  Exit Doors. 5.45.1.  ECM  doors  are  not  authorized  for  new  construction  projects  used  as  operating locations or for existing ECMs converted to use as operating locations.  Existing operating 98 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 locations using ECM doors may be grandfathered if the ESP has been formerly approved by the DDESB or AFSEC/SEW. 5.45.2.  Exit doors in operating buildings will open outward. (T-1). 5.45.3.  During operating hours, exit doors may be fastened with dead-bolt panic hardware that cannot be operated from the outside. 5.45.4.  Exit  doors  must  never  be  less  than  32  inches  (refer  to  NFPA  101,    paragraph 7.2.1.2.4. for exceptions to the 32 inch width) by 80 inches high. (T-1). 5.45.5.  Do not obstruct exit doors or departure routes. 5.45.6.  Exit  doors  must  be  panel  or  flush  surface  type  construction  except  for  existing storage magazines already approved by AFSEC/SEW or DDESB. (T-1). 5.45.7.  Vision  panels  in  each  door  are  desirable.  The  using  agency  may  omit  them  for security. Vision panels must be in the upper half of the door, not exceed 100 square inches, glazed with acrylic plastic or equivalent material and be of shatter resistant, non-combustible material  or  slow-burning  material  of  a  type  that  is  practically  smokeless.  (T-1).    The requirements of Section 5B do not apply to vision panels in exit doors. 5.46.  Safety Chutes.  Provide safety chutes as exits from multistory hazardous locations where rapid egress is vital and cannot be otherwise provided. 5.46.1.  Make  supporting  members  for  safety  chutes  of  non-combustible  materials  and anchored to structural members designed to provide resistance to the effects of an explosion or fire. 5.46.2.  Provide these chutes for work levels above the ground floor and placed on opposite sides of the operation (so that people will not be trapped by a fire between them and a single chute). 5.46.3.  Exits  to  safety  chutes  will  open  on  a  platform  at  least  three  feet  square,  equipped with guardrails. (T-1).  The chutes will begin at the outside edge of the platform. 5.46.4.  Landings from safety chutes must be located where escape routes will be free from tripping hazards, low guy lines, drains, ditches, or other obstructions. (T-1). 5.46.5.  A manual or automatic tripping device must be installed at or near the entrance to chutes to give an alarm in the operating building and nearby structures. (T-1).  This tripping device may also actuate deluge valves and water curtains in the building or room affected. 5.46.6.  Recommended safety chute dimensions and construction requirements include a 40-50 degree angle with the horizontal; a 24 inch depth, and a 12 inch radius at the bottom.  The lower end of the chute will not be over 24 inches above the ground and will have enough of a horizontal run to prevent an injury to the employee because of the rate of fall (induced speed) during the exit. 5.46.6.1.  Chutes 40 feet long require six feet of horizontal run. 5.46.6.2.  The juncture of sections will be well-rounded and must overlap in the direction of travel. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 99 Section 5K—Explosive Dust Collection Systems 5.47.  Vacuum Collection.  Vacuum (aspirator) systems with a wet-type collector that moistens explosive dust close to the point of origin and keeps it wet until the dust is removed for disposal are preferred.  However, some dusts, (e.g., Explosive D) must be collected in a dry-type system. 5.47.1.  Arrange  vacuum  systems  so  each  type  of  explosive  is  collected  separately  or  so dissimilar hazards (e.g., black powder with lead azide) are not mixed. 5.47.2.  Provision must be made for the proper liberation of gases that may be formed in a vacuum system. 5.47.3.  Vacuum systems used to  collect more sensitive explosives (such  as black powder, lead  azide,  mercury  fulminate,  tracer,  igniter,  incendiary  compositions,  and  pyrotechnic materials) must be used only for operations with fuzes, detonators, small arms ammunition, and  black  powder  igniters.  (T-1).    Wet-type  collectors  are  required,  with  a  compatible wetting agent close to the point of intake. (T-1). 5.48.  Location of Dry-Type Collection Chambers. 5.48.1.  Stationary  dry-type  collection  chambers  must  be  located  outside  of  operating buildings, in the open or in a separate building used exclusively for collection chamber. (T-1). 5.48.1.1.  A  protective  barrier  [e.g.,  operational  shield,  barricade,  SDW]  is  required between the operating building and the outside location or separate building where the vacuum collection chamber is placed. (T-1). 5.48.1.2.  If the chamber contains 25 pounds of explosives or less, locate the protective barrier at least eight feet from the operating building. 5.48.1.3.  If  the  chamber  contains  more  than  25  pounds  of  explosives,  the  protective barrier will be separated from the operating building by a minimum of ILD based on the quantity of explosives in the chamber. (T-1). 5.48.1.4.  When  it  is  not  practicable  to  locate  dry-type  vacuum  collection  chambers outside the operating building, a separate room within the building may be set aside for the  purpose.    This  room  must  not  contain  other  operations  and  never  be  used  as  a communicating  corridor  or  passageway  between  other  operating  locations  within  the building when explosives are being collected. (T-1).  If more than one collection chamber is placed in the room, subdivide the room into cubicles separated by SDWs.  Not more than one collection chamber will be in a single cubicle. 5.48.2.  Do  not  place  portable  dry-type  vacuum  collectors  in  a  bay  or  cubicle  where explosives are present.  If they do not contain more than five pounds of explosives, they may be placed outside the building or in a separate cubicle with SDWs.  If they contain more than five pounds, the requirements for stationary collectors apply. 5.49.  Location  of  Wet-Type  Collection  Chambers.  If  stationary  and  portable  wet-type collection chambers do not contain more than five pounds of explosives, they may be placed in operating  bays  or  cubicles.    If  placed  in  separate  cubicles,  the  limits  for  each  one  may  be  15 pounds.  If they contain more than 15 pounds, the location requirements for dry-type collectors will apply. 100 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.50.  Design and Operation of Collection Systems. 5.50.1.  Electrically ground the entire system and test the grounds semiannually. 5.50.2.  Design the system so that metal parts do not pinch explosives or explosive dusts. 5.50.3.  Pipes  or  tubes  through  which  dust  travels  must  have  flanged,  welded,  or  rubber connections.  Threaded connections are not allowed. 5.50.4.  Design the system to reduce accumulation of explosive dust in parts other than the collection chamber. 5.50.5.  Use long radius turns (centerline radius at least four times the diameter of the duct) in the duct work. 5.50.6.  Keep the number of points of application of vacuum to a minimum. 5.50.7.  Each  room  requiring  vacuum  collection  must  have  a  separate  exhaust  line  to  the primary collection chamber. (T-1).  Service no more than two bays by a common leader to the primary collection chamber. 5.50.8.  The vacuum line must be as short as possible from points of application of vacuum to the wet collectors. 5.50.9.  Keep the number of wet primary collectors serviced by a single secondary collector at  a  minimum.    Connect  no  more  than  two  dry  primary  collectors  to  a  single  secondary collector (wet or dry-type). 5.50.10.  If  an  operation  does  not  create  an  airborne  concentration  of  dust,  a  manually operated suction hose to remove explosive dust is preferred. 5.50.11.  Do not connect manually operated hoses to explosive dust-producing machines.  A permanent attachment increases the risk of propagation through the collection system should a detonation occur at the dust-producing machine. 5.50.12.  In dry vacuum collection systems, install two collection chambers in series, ahead of the pump or exhaust. 5.50.13.  Wet collectors must provide for immersion of explosives to break up air bubbles, to release airborne particles, and to remove airborne moisture before it leaves the collector. (T-1). This keeps moistened particles of explosives from entering the small piping between the collector and the exhaust or pump. 5.50.14.  Remove  explosive  dust  from  the  collection  chamber  at  least  once  each  shift  to eliminate unnecessary and hazardous concentrations of explosives. (T-1).  Clean the entire system weekly (T-1), dismantling the parts if necessary. Section 5L—Water Supply and Fire Suppression Systems for Explosives Facilities 5.51.  Water  Supply  for  Explosives  Manufacturing  Areas  and  Loading  Plants.  Install  an outside,  underground,  looped  system  of  mains.    The  water  distribution  system  will  meet  the requirements of UFC 3-600-01 and the NFPA 1142, Standard on Water Supplies for Suburban and  Rural  Fire  Fighting.  (T-1).    Mains  will  be  valved  properly  and  will  not  extend  under explosives locations. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.52.  Automatic Sprinkler Systems. 101 5.52.1.  Certain  buildings  in  explosives  manufacturing,  surveillance,  and  inspection  or ammunition  workshop  areas  (e.g.,  the  receiving  building  in  a  load  line)  may  require automatic  sprinkler  systems.    Determine  the  proper  system  by  engineering  studies  of  the hazards  involved.    Also,  equip  each  system  with  an  audible  warning  device  to  alert personnel.  Connect sprinkler systems in each building into the central  alarm location and install sprinkler systems as prescribed in UFC 3-600-01. (T-1). 5.52.2.  When explosives facilities are placarded for “Apply No Water”, automatic sprinkler systems will only be disabled after a risk assessment has been accomplished/approved by the local fire chief.  If the risk assessment indicates the continued use of the automatic system is appropriate (e.g., to keep a potential fire from reaching the explosives items), the presence of the  “Apply  No  Water”  and  an  operable  automatic  sprinkler  system  does  not  constitute  a violation of this standard.  In all cases, the audible warning device must remain operable. (T-1). 5.53.  Deluge  Systems.  Machinery  or  operations  in  which  there  is  a  process  fire  hazard  will have an auto deluge system as required by an engineering study. 5.53.1.  Use  quick-acting  sensors  such  as  ultraviolet  detectors.    In  addition,  provide  hand-operated, quick-acting deluge control equipment. 5.53.2.  Actuate control devices by rate of rise, fixed temperature, or their combination, as appropriate.  If the system contains electrical components, place the controls in enclosures approved by the NEC. 5.53.3.  Charge  deluge  systems  with  steam,  water,  or  chemicals.    This  depends  on  the expected character of the fire to be controlled, as determined by engineering studies of the hazards  and  NFPA  13,  Standard  for  the  Installation  of  Sprinkler  Systems,  and  NFPA  16, Standard for the Installation of Foam-Water Sprinkler and Foam-Water Spray Systems. 5.53.4.  If there are two or more deluge systems in the same fire area, supply mains and the arrangements  and  size  of  the  system  riser  will  provide  each  system  with  the  required quantities of water per head. 5.53.5.  A device will be installed on the supply side of the system so that it will actuate an audible warning device in affected operating areas when the pressure fails. 5.53.6.  Stop operations protected by a deluge system immediately if the system fails and do not resume until adequate protection is provided. Section 5M—Monitoring of Design and Construction of Explosives Facilities 5.54.  Monitoring  of  Design  of Explosives  Facilities.  Weapons Safety and Civil Engineering must jointly ensure the design requirements of this Chapter, and Chapters 4 and 6, are properly incorporated  into  design  specifications  (to  include  the  statement  of  work  when  design  and construction effort is being contracted) and as-built drawings for new explosives facilities. (T-1). Additionally,  those  requirements  that  apply  to  nuclear  weapon  storage,  maintenance,  and handling  facilities  as  defined  in  AFMAN  91-118,  Safety  Design  and  Evaluation  Criteria  for Nuclear Weapon Systems, must also be addressed in construction planning of new facilities for these purposes. (T-1).  102 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.55.  Monitoring  of  Construction  of  Explosives  Facilities.  In  regards  to  the  actual construction of explosives facilities, Weapons Safety and Civil Engineering must jointly: 5.55.1.  Ensure  compliance  with  the  final  approved  construction  drawings  with  regard  to design requirements driven by explosives safety considerations. (T-1). 5.55.2.  Ensure any changes that affect explosives safety considerations are reflected on the as-built drawings and the ESP updated if necessary. (T-1). 5.55.3.  Ensure  that  the  actual  construction  location  of  sited  explosives  facilities  complies with the approved ESP. (T-1). 5.55.4.  Ensure temporary  construction workers  are provided protection from explosives in nearby facilities per paragraph 12.17.11. (T-1). 5.55.5.  Ensure  explosives  in  nearby  facilities  are  protected  from  temporary  construction operations. (T-1).  Give consideration to fire hazards and radio frequency (RF) hazards. Section 5N—Maintenance and Repair of Explosives Facilities and Equipment 5.56.  Removal of Explosives.  Supervisory and weapons safety personnel will determine, based on a risk assessment, whether explosives must be removed prior to performing maintenance and repair  of  explosives  facilities,  or  maintenance  and  repair  of  equipment  in  explosives  facilities (see Chapter 4). (T-1). 5.56.1.  Only perform maintenance and repair in the interior of an ECM that contains bulk explosives if the explosives are physically protected and a risk assessment shows that hazards to the explosives can be adequately controlled (see Chapter 4). (T-1). 5.56.2.  Because  electricians  are  not  allowed  to  work  on  live  electrical  equipment  while wearing conductive shoes, remove all explosives from areas with conductive floors before proceeding with the electrical work. (T-1). 5.57.  Requirements for Maintenance and Repair With Explosives Present. 5.57.1.  Brief  maintenance  personnel  on  the  hazards  involved  and  precautions  needed  to perform the work safely, and actions to take in the event of an accident. (T-1).  This includes self-help projects. 5.57.2.  If hazards warrant, trained weapons safety personnel must monitor repair activities for safety.  The monitor will halt repair activities when, in their opinion, hazards are being created. (T-1).  The senior supervisor of the facility will resolve the problem before resuming operations. (T-1). 5.57.3.  Keep floor clean and free of extraneous materials and equipment in immediate area. 5.57.4.  Hot Work. 5.57.4.1.  Do not use flame or heat-producing equipment inside the facility unless facility contents  are  protected  from  the  flame,  sparks  and  heat  by  physical  separation  or shielding. (T-1). 5.57.4.2.  Keep  flame  or  heat-producing  equipment  used  outside  the  facility  as  far  as practicable from all explosives (to include explosives in nearby facilities).  When needed, use baffles and screens to confine sparks and flames. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 103 5.57.4.3.  Meet requirements of AFI 91-203. 5.57.4.4.  Notify the fire department before work begins. (T-1). 5.57.5.  Maintenance  personnel  must  wear  conductive  footwear  in  areas  with  conductive floors. (T-1). 5.57.6.  Ensure RF hazards presented by maintenance and repair operations are evaluated and controlled IAW AFI 91-208. 5.58.  Maintenance of Explosives Facilities. 5.58.1.  Annually check the depth of the earth cover on ECMs to ensure it is at least two feet.  (T-1).    MAJCOMs  may  require  more  frequent  inspections  based  on  environmental conditions.  ECMs with a suitable material finish (e.g., geotextiles, gunite, asphalt) do not require  a  depth  check  as  long  as  there  are  no  signs  of  the  earth  cover  washing  out  from underneath the suitable  material.   If the  earth cover erodes to less than two feet, repair as soon as practical (not to exceed 90 days) or classify as an above-ground magazine. Note:  Barricaded above-ground magazine criteria may be used if the remaining earth cover meets the barricade criteria of Section 6E. 5.58.2.  Periodically check ventilators to ensure they function properly.  Ventilators may be closed where blowing snow or humid air would increase condensation.  They may also be closed to protect supplies from blowing sand.  Set up controls to make sure heat does not build up within the storage space. 5.58.3.  Periodically check fusible links to ensure they are unpainted, serviceable, properly installed, and temperature-rated per paragraph 5.42.2. 5.59.  Maintenance and Repair in Hazardous Locations.  Before beginning maintenance and repair in a hazardous location, a weapons safety representative will ensure the area is inspected for the presence of explosives residue.  Maintenance personnel must provide for the removal of all  hazardous  materials,  to  include  removal  of  all  explosive  residue  material  from  equipment, crevices beneath floors, within walls and pipes, and under fittings where explosives may have collected and thoroughly wash down the area. 5.60.  Maintenance  and  Repair  of  Hazardous  Location  Equipment  and  Electrical Installations.  Extraordinary care will be taken in the maintenance and repair of equipment and electrical installations in hazardous locations. 5.60.1.  Equipment and electrical installations must be periodically inspected and maintained by qualified personnel, with a written record kept of the inspections and maintenance. (T-1).  Where  inspection  frequency  is  not  prescribed  in  a  TO,  technical  manual  (TM),  or  other directive,  the  inspection  period  will  be  decided  by  the  local  fire  chief  on  the  basis  of  the existing situation.   (T-1). 5.60.2.  Before repairs are allowed on any equipment or electrical installation that has been exposed  to  explosive  residue  contamination,  clean  the  equipment  and  tag  it.  (T-1).    The operating supervisor must sign the tag, certifying that all explosives have been removed. (T-1).    If  it  has  been  impossible  to  clean  some  part,  note  this  on the  tag,  together  with  clear instructions to maintenance personnel on how to handle it safely. 104 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 5.61.  Maintenance  and  Repair  of  Electrical  Equipment.  Only  qualified  persons  are authorized to maintain and repair electrical equipment.  Where the  equipment may have been exposed  to  explosives  contamination,  the  explosives  will  be  removed  or  neutralized  before repairs are started. 5.62.  Post-Maintenance and Repair of Explosives Facilities and Equipment. 5.62.1.  Inspect the facility after completion of the work to ensure it is safe for resumption of explosives storage or operations. 5.62.2.  Examine  and  test  newly  repaired  equipment  to  ensure  its  safe  operating  condition before resuming use of the equipment. Table 5.1.  Lightning Sideflash Policy for Nuclear Weapon Configurations. Notes: 1. Maintenance Actions accomplished IAW Special Procedures, Alts or Mods must be reviewed and approved IAW AFI 91-103.  Sideflash policy requirements must be determined on a case-by case basis and properly documented via Special Procedures, Alts or Mods. 2. See 11N-B83-1A, Assembly, Test, Maintenance, and Storage Procedures with Illustrated Parts Breakdown; B83-0/-1 (Supplement).  3. Major Maintenance is any activity where major sub-assemblies are separated.    AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 105 PROTECTIVE CONSTRUCTION AND SPECIFIC EXPLOSIVES FACILITY DESIGNS Chapter 6 Section 6A—Introduction 6.1.  General. 6.1.1.  This Chapter contains standards for construction of earth-covered magazines (ECM), barricaded  open  storage  modules,  barricades,  revetments,  substantial  dividing  walls, firewalls, and multicube or segregated magazines. 6.1.2.  Facilities constructed per this Chapter: 6.1.2.1.  Are permitted to use reduced separation distance criteria as shown in Chapter 12. 6.1.2.2.  Must meet all the other design criteria of Chapter 5. 6.2.  Aboveground Magazines (AGM).  See Chapter 5 for electrical and LPS design criteria. 6.3.  Special  Structures.  The  DDESB  has  approved  reduced  NEWQD  and  reduced  QD  for AGM and containers listed in DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction.  Use and siting of these AGM and containers must meet all conditions or restrictions specified in the design and approval documentation as described in the referenced document. 6.4.  High  Performance  Magazines  and  Underground  Explosives  Facilities.  See  DoD 6055.09-M  for  information  on  High  Performance  Magazines  and  underground  explosives facilities. Section 6B—Protective Construction 6.5.  Purpose  of  Protective  Construction.  Construction  features  and  location  are  important safety  considerations  when  planning  facilities.    Potential  explosions’  effects  may  be  altered significantly  by  construction  features  that  limit  the  amount  of  explosives  involved,  attenuate blast  overpressure  or  thermal  radiation,  and  reduce  the  quantity  and  range  of  hazardous fragments and debris.  The major objectives in facility planning are: 6.5.1.  Protection  against  explosive  propagation  between  adjacent  bays  or  buildings  and personnel  protection  against  death  or  serious  injury  from  incidents  in  adjacent  bays  or buildings.    Consider  the  construction  of  separate  buildings  to  limit  explosive  propagation, rather  than  the  use  of  either  protective  construction  or  separation  of  explosives  within  a single  building  when  safety  would  be  greatly  enhanced  or  cost  would  be  significantly reduced. 6.5.2.  Protection of assets, when warranted. Note:  Proper location of ES in relation to PES helps minimize unacceptable damage and injuries in the event of an incident.   106 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 6.6.  Requirements  for  Use  of  Protective  Construction.  Hardening  an  ES  or  constructing  a PES to suppress explosion effects and provide an appropriate degree of protection may allow a reduction of the separation distances required by QD tables. 6.6.1.  Accomplish  design  of  explosion  resistant  facilities  by  an  organization  or  individual experienced  in  the  field  of  structural  dynamics  using  design  procedures  accepted  by professionals in the field.  UFC 3-340-02 (formally known as TM-5-1300), is an appropriate source of effects data and design methods. 6.6.2.  Existing,  Approved  Protective  Construction  Designs.    DDESB  TP  15  documents previously  approved  protective  construction  designs.    An  ESP  using  approved  protective construction designs must: 6.6.2.1.  Reference the DDESB approval memorandum. (T-1). 6.6.2.2.  Identify the design or drawing numbers used, if available. (T-1). 6.6.2.3.  Specify that the protective construction will be used in the same manner as that stated in the referenced in the DDESB approval memorandum. (T-1). 6.6.2.4.  State that the structural design has not been altered in any manner that impacts the design’s integrity or its ability to provide the required level of protection. (T-1). 6.6.2.5.  State that the site specific adaptations of the design have been reviewed and are appropriate for the site conditions. (T-1). 6.6.3.  Modifications  to  Previously  Approved  Protective  Construction  Designs.    For  a protective construction design previously approved by the DDESB, where a structural aspect of  the  protective  design  has  been  modified  by  a  structural  engineer  with  experience  in designing blast resistant structures, the submitting MAJCOM must provide: 6.6.3.1.  A complete description of the structural modifications made, the reasons for the modifications, and any explosives safety impact resulting from the modifications. 6.6.3.2.  The basis of design and the explosives safety protection being afforded by the modified design. 6.6.3.3.  The following protective construction design and MAJCOM review data: 6.6.3.3.1.  For preliminary DDESB approval, concept structural design drawings that are  at  least  35  percent  complete.    For  final  DDESB  approval,  the  structural  design drawings must be at least 60 percent complete, with all protective construction design modifications sufficiently developed for validation. 6.6.3.3.2.  Design calculations for all critical structural elements. 6.6.3.3.3.  All applicable electrical, grounding, and LPS details. 6.6.3.3.4.  Supporting  blast  analysis,  experimental  data  reports,  blast  design calculations, and other technical information.  Blast analysis and design calculations must satisfy UFC 3-340-02 requirements. 6.6.3.3.5.  A  memorandum  from  the  submitting  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer  or AFIMSC Detachment Commander verifying that the protective construction design modifications comply with DoD 6055.09-M and UFC 3-340-02 requirements.  Base AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 107 this  verification  upon  a  quality  control  review  (unless  a  more  detailed  independent technical review is warranted based upon either the lack of experience by the designer or the use of a new, unvalidated blast analysis or design approach) by a competent DoD blast design agency such as the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EEWC) or the US Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville  (USAESCH).    Because  both  of  these  organizations  operate  on  a  cost reimbursable basis, projects must arrange payment for these organization’s services. 6.6.3.3.6.  AFSEC/SEWC will provide appropriate contact information upon request. 6.6.4.  New Protective Construction Designs.  For a new protective construction design, the submitting MAJCOM must provide: 6.6.4.1.  The criteria being met; a complete description of both the design’s capabilities and the basis for the design, and the level of explosives safety protection level it affords. 6.6.4.2.  The following protective construction design and MAJCOM review data: 6.6.4.2.1.  For preliminary DDESB approval, concept structural design drawings that are  at  least  35  percent  complete.    For  final  DDESB  approval,  the  structural  design drawings must be at least 60 percent complete, with all protective construction design modifications sufficiently developed for validation. 6.6.4.2.2.  Design calculations for all critical structural elements. 6.6.4.2.3.  All applicable electrical, grounding, and LPS details. 6.6.4.2.4.  Supporting  blast  analysis,  experimental  data  reports,  blast  design calculations, and other technical information.  Blast analysis and design calculations must satisfy UFC 3-340-02 requirements. 6.6.4.2.5.  A  memorandum  from  the  submitting  MAJCOM  Civil  Engineer  or AFIMSC Detachment Commander verifying that the protective construction design complies with DoD 6055.09-M and UFC 3-340-02 requirements.  This verification will  be  based  upon  a  quality  control  review  (unless  a  more  detailed  independent technical review is warranted based upon either the lack of experience by the designer or the use of a new, unvalidated blast analysis or design approach) by a competent DoD  blast  design  agency  such  as  the  Naval  Facilities  Engineering  Services  Center (NAVFAC  EEWC)  or  the  US  Army  Engineering  and  Support  Center,  Huntsville (USAESCH).    AFSEC/SEWC  will  provide  appropriate  contact  information  upon request.  Because both of these organizations operate on a cost reimbursable basis, projects must arrange payment for these organization’s services. 6.6.4.3.  Once  approved,  a  standard  protective  construction  design  can  be  site-adapted, provided the conditions and limitations of the DDESB approval are met.  The DDESB will document new standard approved protective construction designs in DDESB TP 15. Section 6C—Earth-Covered Magazines 6.7.  Earth-Covered Magazines.  An ECM's primary purpose is to protect AE.  To qualify for the  default  IMD  in  Table  12.1.,  an  ECM,  acting  as  an  ES,  must  not  collapse.    Although 108 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 substantial permanent deformation of the ECM may occur, provide sufficient space to prevent the deformed structure or its doors from striking the contents. 6.8.  Earth-Covered Magazine NEWQD Limits.  ECMs may be approved for storage of up to 500,000 lbs NEWQD of HD 1.1 IAW paragraph 12.6.1.   6.9.  Earth-Covered  Magazine  Design  Load  Criteria.  ECMs must be designed to withstand the following: 6.9.1.  Conventional  (e.g.,  live,  dead,  snow)  loads  for  the  barrel  and  rear  wall  of  an  arch-shaped ECM. 6.9.2.  Conventional (e.g., live, dead, snow) and blast-induced loads for the roof, rear wall, and side walls of a flat-roofed ECM. Note: Undefined ECMs must meet the criteria of paragraphs 6.9.1. through 6.9.3. only.   6.9.3.  Expected blast loads, as applicable: 6.9.3.1.  On  the  head  wall  and  door  of  3-Bar  ES  ECM  is  a  triangular  pulse  with  peak overpressure of 43.5 psi and impulse of 11.3W1/3 psi-ms. 6.9.3.2.  On  the  head  wall  and  door  of  7-Bar  ES  ECM  is  a  triangular  pulse  with  peak overpressure of 101.5 psi and impulse of 13.9W1/3 psi-ms. 6.9.3.3.  On the roof of a flat-roofed ES ECM is a triangular pulse with peak overpressure of 108 psi and impulse of 19W1/3 psi-ms. 6.10.  Earth-Covered Magazine Earth Cover Criteria. 6.10.1.  Earth cover will be reasonably cohesive and free from harmful (toxic) matter, trash, debris, and stones heavier than ten pounds or larger than six inches in diameter.  Solid or wet clay or similar types of soil will not be used as earth cover because they are too cohesive.  The larger of acceptable stones must be limited to the lower center of fills and must not be used for earth covered magazines.  Compact and prepare the earthen material, as necessary, for structural integrity and erosion control. 6.10.2.  If it is impossible to use a cohesive material (e.g., in sandy soil), or where vegetation growth is ineffective in preventing erosion, finish the earth cover over ECM with a suitable material (e.g.,  geotextiles, gunite, asphalt) that  will not produce hazardous debris, but will ensure  structural  integrity.  The  important  consideration  for  these  materials  is  that  they pulverize in the event of an accidental explosion. A mixture combined with straw, bark, or comparable  material  would  be  suitable.  Wire  mesh  may  be  used  in  the  finishing  material. Aggregate may not be added to the finishing material. Consider means  of validating earth cover depth as part of the design of the finishing material.  Reference TM 5-630, Natural Resources and Land Management, for further information. 6.10.3.  Select vegetation for ECM so that their weight or root system will not damage the structure. 6.10.4.  The earth fill or earth cover between ECM may be either solid or sloped.  Maintain a minimum of two feet of earth cover over the top of each ECM. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 109 Note: If the specified thickness and slope of earth on the ECM is not maintained, site the ECM as an AGM.  Barricaded AGM criteria may be used if the remaining earth cover meets the barricade criteria of Section 6E. 6.10.5.  See paragraph 5.58.1. for maintenance of earth cover on ECMs. 6.11.  Earth-Covered Magazine Drawings. 6.11.1.  DDESB  TP  15  provides  listings  of  the  various  types  of  ECM  that  have  been constructed over the  years and identifies their structural strength designator (i.e., 7-Bar, 3-Bar,  or  Undefined).    This  reference  also  lists  the  7-Bar  and  3-Bar  ECM  designs  that  are currently approved for new construction. 6.11.2.  If an ECM's drawing number or numbers are not listed in DDESB TP 15 treat it as an undefined ECM, until a structural analysis is performed to show that the ECM qualifies for another  structural  strength  designation,  or  support  documentation  is  provided  to  prove  the ECM had been approved by the DDESB with a different structural strength designation. 6.11.3.  For existing, arch-shaped undefined ECM, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Report  HNDED-CS-S-95-01,  Guide  For  Evaluating  Blast  Resistance  Of  Nonstandard Magazines, may be used to determine if an Undefined ECM could qualify as a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM. 6.11.4.  DDESB  approval  is  required  prior  to  any  change  in  an  ECM's  structural  strength designator. (T-0). 6.11.5.  Certain ECMs have been approved with reduced NEWQD and reduced QD and these are also listed in DDESB TP 15.  Use of these ECMs requires that their use and siting meet all  conditions  and  restrictions  specified  in  the  design  and  approval  documentation,  as described in the referenced document. 6.11.6.  New construction of previously DDESB-approved 7-Bar and 3-Bar ECM must meet the minimum requirements of the current revisions of the approved drawings. Section 6D—Barricaded Open Storage Modules 6.12.  Barricaded Open Storage Modules.  Modules allow the same amount of explosives to be stored using far less land space.  However, in the event of an unplanned detonation in a cell, AE in an adjacent cell will be covered with earth and unavailable for use until extensive uncovering operations  and  possibly  maintenance  are  completed.    To  reduce  the  MCE  expected  from  an explosion in  one  cell,  buffered  storage  arrangements  may  be  used  as  described  in  paragraph 12.69. 6.13.  Barricaded Open Storage Modules NEWQD and AE Type Limits. 6.13.1.  The  maximum  NEWQD  permitted  to  be  stored  within  each  cell  is  250,000  lbs.  Normal mixing rules apply (see paragraph 12.7.).  HD 1.4 is not additive to the NEWQD. 6.13.2.  Limit storage to AE that will not promptly propagate explosions or mass fire between modules,  and  that  are  not  susceptible  to  firebrands  and  fireballs.    These  restrictions  allow storage  at  K1.1  separation.    IM  distance  for  HD  1.2.x.  and  1.4  for  module  to  module separation is based on total NEWQD.  MCE and Largest Single Round NEWQD (LSRN) are 110 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 not used to calculate IM distance between modules.  Only the following AE are approved for modular storage: 6.13.2.1.  HE bombs (fuzed or unfuzed, with or without fins), and similarly cased HD 1.1 AE when stored on nonflammable pallets. 6.13.2.2.  The items listed below when contained in nonflammable shipping containers: 6.13.2.2.1.  30 mm and smaller AE. 6.13.2.2.2.  CBU. 6.13.2.2.3.  Inert AE components. 6.13.2.2.4.  HD 1.4 AE. 6.13.3.  Minimize module storage of AE items in flammable outer-packaging configurations.  Cover  AE  items  in  flammable  outer  packaging  configurations  with  fire  retardant  material.  Do  not  store  combustible  dunnage  or  other  flammable  material  in,  or  within,  100  feet  of modules. 6.13.4.  When fire retardant materials are used to cover AE items stored in modules, provide ventilation  between  the  covers  and  the  stored  AE  items  to  minimize  the  effects  of  solar heating upon the stored AE. 6.13.5.  Limit  AE  stored  in  each  module  to  one  type  of  item,  unless  the  MAJCOM/SEW authorizes mixed storage. (T-2).  Mixed storage of HE bombs and CBUs presents an extreme fragment hazard and must be avoided. 6.14.  Barricaded Open Storage Module Design Criteria. 6.14.1.  As depicted in Figure 6.1., a module is a barricaded area composed of a series of connected  cells  with  hard  surface  (e.g.,  concrete,  packed  earth,  engineered  materials,  etc.) storage pads separated from each other by barricades. 6.14.2.  The only restriction on the arrangement of cells within a module and of groups of modules is that cell openings may not face each other, unless they are either barricaded or meet QD criteria for an unbarricaded AGM (see Table 12.1.). 6.14.3.  Although a light metal shed or other lightweight fire retardant cover may be used for weather  protection  for  individual  cells,  heavy  structures  (e.g.,  reinforced  concrete,  dense masonry units) or flammable material will not be used. 6.14.4.  Table  6.1.  provides  the  minimum  pad  sizes  necessary  to  store  the  NEWQD indicated.    The  pad's  size  may  need  to  be  adjusted  to  accommodate  specific  AE.    This adjustment impacts the required barricade height (see Table 6.1., Note 3). 6.14.5.  Barricade requirements: 6.14.5.1.  All  barricades  used  in  forming  the  module  will  meet  the  requirements  in Section 6E. (T-1).  The width or length of the stack of AE (controlled by the pad size of the cell) and the distances between the stack and the top of the barricade influences the minimum  barricade  height  requirement.    The  heights  listed  in  Table  6.1.  are  the minimum requirements for barricade locations.  These minimum heights are based upon AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 111 both the storage pad sizes and the separations shown.  When feasible, increase barricade heights (see paragraph 6.16.2.). 6.14.5.2.  Locate  the  centerlines  of  barricades  between  cells  of  the  module  at  a  point halfway between adjacent AE storage pads.  Locate back and end (outside) barricades at the same distance from the pads as those between the cells. 6.14.5.3.  When  selecting  a  site  for  a  module,  take  maximum  advantage  of  natural topographical barriers.  When used, natural barriers provide the same level of protection as the barricade shown in Figure 6.1. Section 6E—Barricades 6.15.  Barricades  . 6.15.1.  Properly  constructed  and  sited  barricades  and  undisturbed  natural  earth  have explosives  safety  applications  for  protecting  against  low-angle  fragments.    Barricades provide no protection against high-angle fragments or lobbed AE; some of these high-angle fragments may travel to the outer limits of protection areas set up for PTR and IBD.  If the barricade is destroyed in the process of providing protection, then secondary fragments from the destroyed barricade must also be considered as part of a hazards analysis. 6.15.2.  To  reduce  hazards  from  high-velocity,  low-angle  fragments,  place  the  barricade between the PES and the ES so that the fragments of concern impact the barricade before the ES.    The  barricade  must  both  be  thick  enough  so  that  it  reduces  fragment  velocities  to acceptable  levels  and  high  enough  so  that  it  intercepts  the  ballistic  trajectories  of  the fragments of concern. 6.15.3.  A barricade must interrupt all direct lines of sight between the ES and PES, and, in addition,  meet  the  height  and  length  requirements  per  paragraphs  6.16.  and    6.17. respectively. 6.15.4.  Barricades around the ES can be used to reduce minimum separations required by Table 12.1. or fragment distances from 1.2 munitions if tests or engineering analysis show the  barrier  will  stop  the  low-angle,  high-velocity  fragments  and  the  building  will  provide protection from the high-angle fragments that can be expected from the PES.  The distance cannot be reduced below that required to provide adequate overpressure protection to the ES. 6.15.5.  A secondary barricade at sites of mission-essential equipment and personnel (such as wing communications and trim pads) can provide some additional protection; however, high-angle, low-velocity fragments will still impact the exposed site. 6.15.6.  Barricades  meeting  the  requirements  of  paragraph  6.15.7.  may  be  modified  by substituting  a  retaining  wall  for  the  slope  on  one  side.    The  slope  and  thickness  of  the retaining wall (preferably of concrete) must ensure a wide enough top to hold the earth firmly in place. 6.15.7.  The  slope  of  an  earthen  barricade  must  be  two  horizontal  to  one  vertical,  unless erosion controls are used.  Earthen barricades with slopes no greater than one and one half horizontal  to  one  vertical  that  were  approved  prior  to  1976  may  continue  to  be  used.  However, renovations to these facilities will meet the above criteria, when feasible. 112 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 6.16.  Barricade Size and Orientation to Prevent Propagation Due to High-Velocity, Low-Angle  Fragments.  Determine  the  location,  height,  and  length  of  a  barricade  to  prevent propagation due to high-velocity, low-angle fragments as follows: 6.16.1.  Location.    The  barricade  may  be  placed  anywhere  between  the  PES  and  the  ES; however, placing it closer to either the PES or ES provides slightly greater asset protection. For AE stacks of different height (elevation), the location determines the barricade’s required height. 6.16.2.  Height.  To determine the required barricade height: 6.16.2.1.  Establish  a  reference  point  at  the  top  of  the  far  edge  of  one  of  the  two  AE stacks between which the barricade is to be constructed.  When both stacks are of equal height,  the  reference  point  may  be  established  on  either  stack.    If  the  tops  of  the  two stacks are not of equal height (elevation), the reference point must be on the top of the lower stack. Note:  To preclude building excessively high barricades between AE stacks of different height (elevation), locate the barricade as close as possible to the lower stack (see Figure 6.2.). 6.16.2.2.  Draw  a  line  from  the  reference  point  to  the  highest  point  of  the  other  stack (line-of-sight). 6.16.2.3.  The barricade's height must be drawn so that the entire width of the barricade crest  is  at  least  one  foot  [0.3  m]  above  the  line-of-sight  as  established  in  paragraph 6.16.2.2.   Note:  Measure the barricade height at the time of construction as prescribed in paragraph 6.16.2.  If the specified thickness and height of the barricade is not maintained, reduce the AE stack height as necessary or resite the AE stacks appropriately.  Consideration should be given to making the barricade higher than required for safety purposes in order to account for accuracy of storage practices regarding AE stack heights, potential mission changes (requiring higher AE stacks), and barricade settling/erosion/etc. that could seriously degrade AE storage capability. 6.16.3.  Length.  Determine the barricade's length per Figure 6.2. 6.17.  Barricade  Size  and  Orientation  for  Barricaded  ILD  Protection.  Determine  the location, height, and length of a barricade as follows: 6.17.1.  Location.  Place the barricade anywhere between the PES and the ES.  The location determines the barricade's required height. 6.17.2.  Height. To determine the required barricade height: 6.17.2.1.  Establish  a  reference  point  at  the  top  of  the  far  edge  of  one  of  the  two  AE stacks  between  the  constructed  barricades.    When  both  stacks  are  of  equal  height,  the reference point may be established on either stack.  If the tops of the two stacks are not of equal height (elevation), place the reference point on the top of the lower stack. Note:  To preclude building excessively high barricades, locate the barricade as close as possible to the stack where the reference point was established (see Figure 6.3.).  When the exposed site is not a PES, measure to the top of the ES.  If the ES is an uninhabited PES (i.e., a service magazine), measure to the top of the stack.  If the ES is an inhabited PES (i.e., an operating location), measure to the top of the ES. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 113 6.17.2.2.  Draw a line from the reference point to the highest point of the other stack. 6.17.2.3.  Draw a second line from the reference point forming an angle of two degrees above the line. 6.17.3.  Length.  Determine the barricade’s length per Figure 6.3. 6.18.  Barricade  Size  and  Orientation  for  Protection  Against  Overpressure.  General procedures  to  predict  pressure  mitigation  versus  barricade  design  and  location  have  not  been developed.  However, based on direct-experimental work, the overpressure loading on a surface area  shielded  by  a  barricade  is  reduced  by  approximately  50  percent  when  the  following conditions are met: 6.18.1.  Overpressure  barricades  are  only  approved  for  use  when  placed  at  the  front  of  7-BAR ECMs as an ES and a fragment barricade is placed at the PES. 6.18.2.  Location. The barricade’s standoff is within two barricade heights of the protected area. 6.18.3.  Height. The top of the barricade is at least as high as the top of the protected area. 6.18.4.  Length. The length of the barricade is at least two times the length of the protected area. 6.19.  Barricade  Construction  Materials.  Materials for earthen barricades will be reasonably cohesive and free from harmful (toxic) matter, trash, debris, and stones heavier than 10 pounds or larger than 6 inches in diameter.  Limit the larger of acceptable stones to the lower center of fills.  Compact and prepare  earthen material, as  necessary, for structural  integrity  and erosion control.  Do not use solid or wet clay or similar types of soil in barricades because they are too cohesive.  If it is impossible to use a cohesive material (e.g., in sandy soil) finish the barricade with  a  suitable  material  (e.g.,  geotextiles,  gunite)  that  does  not  produce  hazardous  debris,  but ensures structural integrity. 6.20.  Barricade Designs. 6.20.1.  DDESB  TP  15  lists  DDESB-approved  designs  and  construction  materials  for barricades.  Use of these barricades satisfies barricading criteria. 6.20.2.  Alternate  barricade  designs  (e.g.,  earth  filled  steel  bin)  may  be  approved  by  the DDESB provided that testing or analysis demonstrates their effectiveness in stopping high velocity, low angle fragments. 6.21.  Natural  Barricades.  Natural  barricades  (e.g.,  hills)  meeting  the  requirements  of  this section are acceptable as barricades.  Submit information in the ESP to demonstrate compliance with barricade design requirements, and include topographical maps of the terrain. 6.22.  Inspection of Barricades  .  Inspect barricades at least annually to determine the degree of settling or erosion.  MAJCOMs may require more frequent inspection based on environmental conditions.  Barricades finished with a suitable material (e.g., geotextiles, gunite, asphalt) do not require a depth check as long as there are no signs of the earth fill washing out from underneath the suitable material.  Add fill if a barricade has deteriorated and it no longer provides effective protection.    Also  inspect  wood  riveted  barricades  and  replace  rotten  timbers  or  planking.  Maintain barricades so as to prevent erosion or fire hazards.  If the magazine’s earth cover erodes 114 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 to  less  than  two  foot  repair  as  soon  as  practical  (not  to  exceed  90  days)  or  classify  as  an aboveground unbarricaded magazine. Section 6F—Earth-Filled, Steel Bin-Type Barricades for Outside Storage 6.23.  Earth-Filled, Steel Bin-Type Barricades for Outside Storage. 6.23.1.  These  barricades,  also  known  as  revetments,  are  earth-filled  steel  bins  used  to separate AE awaiting scheduled processing (e.g., AE on a flightline associated with aircraft parking  or  loading  operations;  or  the  temporary  positioning  of  AE  awaiting  transfer  to preferred,  long-term  storage).    These  barricades,  also  used  to  separate  explosive-loaded aircraft, are normally used to form a series of cells.  They are designed to limit the MCE, for QD siting purposes, of AE properly positioned in separate cells by preventing propagation to adjacent cells. 6.23.2.  When properly sited, these cells prevent propagation; however; all assets in the series of cells are at risk of loss.  Although a revetment is effective in limiting the blast loading of an adjacent ES to that produced by the largest contents of a single cell, there is a significant probability that the contents of many of the cells may be damaged or destroyed by the initial and  subsequent  fire  and  explosion  events.    The  extent  of  such  losses  increases  with  the amount of explosives present. 6.24.  Revetment HD Limits.  Revetments cells are approved for storage of any HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE assigned to SG 1 through 4 (as discussed in paragraph 3.22.).  In addition, storage of HD 1.3, HD 1.4, or HD 1.6 items is approved. 6.25.  Types of Revetments. 6.25.1.  Type A revetments, which must be a minimum of seven feet thick, can be used to limit a MCE in a series of cells to the largest quantity in a single cell, provided the quantity in the single cell does not exceed 30,000 pounds NEWQD. 6.25.2.  Type B revetments, which must be a minimum of 5.25 feet thick, can be similarly used to limit the MCE, provided no cell contains more than 5,000 pounds NEWQD. 6.26.  Requirements  for  Revetments.  For  revetments  to  be  used  effectively,  the  following conditions must be met: 6.26.1.  The criteria shown in Figure 6.2. (T-1). 6.26.2.  AE will be positioned no closer than 10 feet from cell walls, no closer than three feet from the end of the wing walls, and no higher than two feet below the top of cell walls. (T-1). 6.26.3.  AE  will  be  distributed  over  the  available  area  within  the  cell,  rather  than  being concentrated in a small area. (T-1). 6.26.4.  AE  stored  in  a  cell  in  quantities  near  the  maximum  NEWQD  limit  will  not  be configured into a single row of pallets, stacks, or trailers. (T-1). 6.26.5.  The storage of AE in flammable outer-pack configurations will be minimized. (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 115 Section 6G—Substantial Dividing Walls and Blast Doors 6.27.  Substantial  Dividing  Walls.  These  walls  are  one  way  of  separating  explosives  into smaller groups to minimize the effects of an explosion and allow a reduction in QD separation.  To  receive  credit  as  a  dividing  wall,  reinforced  concrete  walls  must  either  meet  Substantial Dividing Wall (SDW) criteria or be designed IAW the criteria in UFC 3-340-02.  These walls may be used to comply with the compatibility group mixing rules given in Chapter 7 provided the required IMD between the substantial dividing walls are maintained as discussed below. Note:  Dividing walls filled with earth or sand, used to compartmentalize magazines must be at least five feet thick with earth or sand packed between retaining walls.  Sand-bag type dividing walls will be at least five feet thick, except where approved for other uses as in TO 11N-20-7.  See DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction, for all storage requirements. 6.27.1.  Definition of an SDW.  An SDW is a reinforced concrete wall having the following characteristics: 6.27.1.1.  A minimum thickness of 12 inches. 6.27.1.2.  A minimum steel reinforcing bar of ½-inch diameter (#4). 6.27.1.3.  Steel reinforcing bars are spaced not more than 12 inches on center horizontally and vertically, on both faces of the wall, with bars on one face staggered with the bars on the opposite face. 6.27.1.4.  Concrete cover over the steel reinforcing bars in approximately 2 inches thick. 6.27.1.5.  Concrete has a minimum compressive strength of 2,500 pounds per square inch (psi). 6.27.1.6.  SDW main steel is continuous into supports as follows: 6.27.1.6.1.  If the SDW is used for prevention of propagation of burning reactions, it must, at a minimum, be adequately supported at the floor. 6.27.1.6.2.  If  the  SDW  is  used  for  personnel  protection,  from  either  detonation  or burning  reactions,  for  remotely-controlled  operations,  it  must,  at  a  minimum,  be adequately supported on at least two sides (e.g., the SDW is supported at the floor and with at least one adjacent SDW). Note:  Existing 12-inch reinforced concrete walls originally constructed for explosives operations, explosives storage, or remotely controlled explosives operations are considered adequate for meeting requirements listed in paragraphs 6.28.1.1. through 6.28.1.6. 6.27.2.  When  an  SDW described  above  is  incorporated  into  a  room  or  cubicle,  additional structural considerations must be addressed in order to limit internal pressure build-up within the room or cubicle and assure the capability of the SDW to provide propagation protection to munitions in adjacent rooms or cubicles.  For this reason, the following additional criteria apply to a room or cubicle incorporating one or more SDW: 6.27.2.1.  A minimum of two surfaces (wall or roof) of the room or cubicle must be open and frangible.  A surface is considered frangible if its unit weight < 10 lbs/ft2.  If a roof is treated as one of the frangible surfaces, then any potential additional dead load must be considered when  calculating the  roof’s unit weight.   In areas where the  design  ground 116 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 snow load, pg, in ASCE 7, “Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures” (latest  version)  or  UFC  3-310-01,  “Structural  Load  Data,”  exceeds  20  lbs/ft2,  the calculation of a roof’s unit weight must include consideration of potential snow load.  To avoid  undue  conservatism,  the  snow  load  contribution  to  a  roof’s  unit  weight  may  be taken as 42 percent of the average roof design snow load, calculated IAW ASCE 7. 6.27.2.2.  A  minimum  scaled  vent  area  (Av/V2/3)  of  1.85  will  be  provided;  where  Av = total area of frangible and open surfaces (ft2) and V = volume of room (ft3). 6.27.2.3.  When used as a firewall for prevention of propagation of burning reactions, the SDW must be continuous from the floor to the roofline to mitigate thermal effects unless otherwise required by local fire codes to extend above the roof.  When used to prevent propagation, the SDW must be at least two feet higher than the AE stacks on either side of the SDW. 6.27.2.4.  Those rooms or cubicles containing only materials that are expected to exhibit burning reactions will have adequate venting area; that is, a frangible wall or roof. 6.27.3.  Application and use of SDW for prevention of propagation of burning reactions. The following conditions apply to the use of SDW for the prevention of propagation of burning reactions.  When these conditions are not met, individual NEWQD of each room or cubicles will be summed together and QD will be based on the summed NEWQD. 6.27.3.1.  To prevent propagation in any acceptor room or cubicle separated by an SDW from  adjacent  donor  rooms  or  cubicles,  limit  each  adjacent  donor  room  or  cubicle containing  material  that  will  detonate  to  a  maximum  of  425  pounds  NEWQD  or  to  a loading density (NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.20 pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first.    Limit  each  adjacent  donor  room  or  cubicle  containing  HD  1.2.1  material  to  a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds, and to an MCE of 425 pounds or a loading density of (MCE/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.20 pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first.  Limit each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.2 material to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds.  Limit each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.3 material to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds, and to a largest single item NEWQD of 425 pounds or a loading density of (largest single item NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.20 pounds/ft3,  whichever  is  attained  first.    For  HD  1.1  and  HD  1.2.1  located  in  acceptor rooms or cubicles, limit storage to SG 1, 2, 3, and 4 AE only.  Place HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE no closer than three feet from the nearest wall. 6.27.3.2.  To  prevent  a  propagation  involving  SG  5  in  an  acceptor  room  or  cubicle separated by an SDW from adjacent donor rooms or cubicles, each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing material that will detonate is limited to a maximum of 20 pounds NEWQD,  or  to  a  loading  density  (NEWQD/room  volume  (ft3))  of  <  0.01  pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first.  Each adjacent donor room or  cubicle  containing HD 1.2.1 material  is  limited  to  a  maximum  NEWQD  of  5,000  pounds,  and  to  an  MCE  of  20 pounds or a loading density of (MCE/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.01 pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first.  Each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.2 material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds.  Each adjacent donor room or cubicle containing HD 1.2.3 material is limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,000 pounds, and to a largest single item NEWQD of 20 pounds or a loading density of (largest single item AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 117 NEWQD/room volume (ft3)) of < 0.01 pounds/ft3, whichever is attained first.  HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE will be placed no closer than three feet from the nearest wall. 6.27.3.3.  To prevent propagation of a burning reaction (i.e., HD 1.3) between adjacent rooms or cubicles separated by an SDW, the NEWQD in each room or cubicle is limited to  5,000  pounds  of  packaged  materials  or  300  pounds  for  unpackaged  materials.    No standoff distance from the wall is required for HD 1.3. 6.27.3.4.  When HD 1.2 and HD 1.3 are mixed together within a room or cubicle restrict their  combined  NEWQD  to  5,000  pounds  packaged  or  300  pounds  unpackaged.    The MCE for HD 1.2.1 and the largest single item NEWQD for HD 1.2.3 must comply with the paragraphs above. 6.27.3.5.  Mission essential quantities of HD 1.4 located in donor or acceptor rooms or cubicles do not affect the prevention of propagation of a burning reaction.  No standoff distance from the wall is required for HD 1.4. 6.27.4.  Application and use of SDW for personnel protection during remotely controlled AE operations. The following apply to the use of SDW for personnel protection during remotely controlled AE operations: 6.27.4.1.  Separate personnel from operations involving materials that will detonate either by the shorter K24 separation distance when measured over or around an SDW or by the shortest distance that provides 2.3-psi level of protection to personnel.  For HD 1.1, use the NEWQD; for HD 1.2.1, use the MCE ; for HD 1.2.2, an NEWQD of 1.6 pounds must be used; and for HD 1.2.3, use the largest single item NEWQD. 6.27.4.2.  Separate  personnel  from  operations  involving  only  material  where  a  burning reaction is expected by the shorter K8 separation distance when measured over or around an SDW or by the shortest distance that limits the thermal flux to personnel to prevent the onset of second-degree burns (heat fluxes and exposure times experienced by personnel must be less than that given by the equation t=200q-1.46 where “t” is the time in seconds that a person is exposed and “q” is the received heat flux in kilowatts (kW) per m2). 6.27.4.3.  Protect personnel from fragments and debris having energies of 58 foot-pounds or greater (hazardous fragments).  An SDW that is properly supported on two sides (such as a reinforced concrete floor and another SDW) provides such personnel protection from an MCE involving up to 300 pounds of AE expected to burn or up to 8 pounds of AE expected to detonate.  The MCE for HD 1.1 is the NEWQD; for HD 1.2.1, use the MCE ; and for HD 1.2.3, use the largest single item NEWQD. Note:  For HD 1.2.2, the MCE is less than 8 pounds, by definition. 6.27.5.  If any of the SDW criteria discussed above cannot be met, then separately analyze the  wall  or  room  design  and  explosives  scenario  to  determine  if  equivalent  protection  is provided by the available wall or room arrangement (e.g., a four wall cubicle, an alternate reinforced concrete wall design, a larger room, a greater standoff, or a smaller quantity of SG 5).  The engineering analysis must address the specific conditions according to UFC 3-340-02  criteria  to  determine  the  proper  wall  construction  or  explosives  weight  and  spacing limitations.  DDESB approval is required for any analysis performed. 118 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 6.27.6.  ILD level of protection is not addressed by this section.  The requirement remains K18 or ILD, as specified in the appropriate tables for the HD in question.  Presently, there is no  consideration  that  an  SDW  or  any  type  of  wall  provides  an  equivalent  ILD  level  of protection.  However, if an SDW is determined to provide the required personnel protection from a remotely controlled operation, then by default, it can be assumed that K18 protection is  also  provided  by  that  SDW.    Refer  to  UFC  3-340-02  and  MIL-STD  398A,  Shields, Operational for Ammunition Operations, Criteria for Design and Tests for Acceptance, for personnel protection standards. 6.27.7.  For  nuclear  weapons,  the  criteria  in  TO  11N-20-7,  Nuclear  Safety  Criteria,  when more restrictive, will be the limiting factor and override the above criteria. 6.27.8.  The provisions of paragraph 4.19. apply. 6.28.  Blast Doors.  Blast Doors may be required for openings through SDWs.  When required, design these doors to be at least equal in strength to the SDW.  See UFC 3-340-02 for design factors  for  new  structures.    Take  care  to  ensure  these  doors  are  not  installed  as  a  matter  of convenience.  Avoid blast doors when a continuous SDW would not unnecessarily interfere with operations. Section 6H—Multicube or Segregated Magazines 6.29.  Multicube  or  Segregated  Magazines.  See  Section  6G  for  guidance.    If  the  NEWQD limit  is  exceeded  in  any  one  cell,  maintain  compatibility  throughout  the  facility  and  the  total NEWQD of all cells is used to compute QD requirements.  See paragraph 12.7. for rules when combining mass detonating with non-mass detonating explosives. 6.29.1.  See  paragraph  12.7.  for  determining  MCE.    When  using  the  provisions  in  this paragraph,  each  cell  may  be  considered  a  separate  facility  with  equivalent  IM  distance between cells, for determining NEWQD in QD calculations. 6.29.2.  A substantial dividing wall that is continuous from the floor to the roofline, unless otherwise  required  by  local  fire  codes  to  extend  above  the  roof,  may  be  used  to  meet equivalent HD 1.3 IMD protection for 5,000 pounds of packaged (shipping or transportation configuration) or 300 pounds of unpackaged HD 1.3 materials. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 119 Figure 6.1.

Introduction.  This  Chapter  provides  general  information  about  explosives  and  safety requirements for operations involving explosives and explosives storage requirements, to include compatibility principles and mixed compatibility storage.  The absence of specific guidance on a particular explosives operation does not imply that safeguards are not applicable. Section 7B—Locally Written Instructions 7.2.  Locally Written Instructions.  Conduct all explosives operations IAW written instructions.  Item TOs generally fulfill this requirement, but may not address all local conditions.  Locally written  instructions  may  be  required  to  address  the  items  in  paragraph  7.3.    Locally  written instructions may take the form of crew briefings, safety briefings, local operating instructions, etc.  The items in paragraph 7.3. may be addressed by one or more of these methods. 7.2.1.  Locally written instructions will be: 7.2.1.1.  Approved by the squadron Commander or equivalent. (T-1). 7.2.1.2.  Coordinated with the weapons safety office and all other involved organizations. (T-1). 7.2.1.3.  Available at the work site. (T-1). 7.2.1.4.  Written in the language workers understand. (T-1). 7.2.1.5.  Briefed to all workers prior to beginning an explosives operation. (T-1).  Ensure workers understand the instructions prior to beginning the operation. 7.2.2.  Locally  written  instructions  are  not  required  for  EOD  emergency  operations  in connection  with  render  safe  procedures  (RSP)  or  disposal  for  level  1  EOD  emergency response operations. 7.2.3.  Locally  written  instructions  are  required  for  level  2  EOD  emergency  response operations when the time required to develop and gain approval of these procedures will not compromise safety or increase the risks posed to life, property, health, or the environment due to the unstable condition of the munition(s) under response.  See AFI 32-3001, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Program, for explosives or munitions emergency response. 7.2.4.  Locally  produced  checklists  and  work  cards  concerning  nuclear  operations  require approval according to TO 00-5-1, Air Force Technical Order System. 7.2.5.  Develop and process locally produced operating instructions according to AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 7.3.  Contents  of  Locally  Written  Instructions.  Include  the  following  information,  as applicable, in locally written instructions.  The MAJCOM will determine if additional items are required. 124 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.3.1.  Personnel limits (see paragraph 7.5.). (T-1). 7.3.2.  Explosives limits, including HD and CG of the explosives involved (see paragraph 7.6.). (T-1). 7.3.3.  Exact locations where operations are done. (T-1). 7.3.4.  Safety requirements, to include special requirements for personal protective clothing, blast  and  fragmentation  hazards,  and  equipment.  (T-1).    Additionally,  static  grounding requirements per Section 7D of this Manual when handling or storing EIDs. 7.3.5.  Step-by-step  procedures  for  doing  the  task  (refer  to  specific  steps  in  the  TO  for applicable portions of the operation). (T-1). 7.3.6.  Actions to be taken during an emergency. (T-1). Section 7C—General Requirements for Operations Involving Explosives Note:  Before conducting intentional detonation operations involving live munitions (e.g., EOD operations  or  range  clearance,  not  including  the  MMRP);  evaluate  the  need  for  having emergency medical support onsite in the risk assessment. 7.4.  Personnel Qualifications. 7.4.1.  Train  personnel  who  work  with  explosives  IAW  AFI  91-202,  The  US  Air  Force Mishap Prevention Program, and qualified in the tasks to be performed. (T-1). 7.4.2.  Personnel  must  understand  all  safety  standards,  requirements,  and  precautions  that apply to the operation. (T-1). 7.4.3.  The  supervisor  must  be  knowledgeable  of  all  hazards  involved  in  the  operation, convey  emergency  procedures  to  workers,  casuals,  and  visitors,  and  maintain  strict housekeeping standards (see paragraph 7.5.3.).  The supervisor must also know what steps to take when abnormal conditions arise. (T-1). 7.5.  Personnel Limits.  Design explosives operations to ensure minimum exposure of personnel to explosives, in compliance with the cardinal principle (see paragraph 1.1.2.).  Supervisors are responsible for enforcing personnel limits. 7.5.1.  Buddy System.  Good industrial safety practices may dictate use of the buddy system even though only one person may be required to perform the work.  Use of the buddy system does not violate the cardinal principle. 7.5.2.  EOD Procedures.  Conduct EOD procedures IAW requirements of AFI 32-3001, Joint Service EOD 60-Series manuals, and EOD Tactical Decision Aid. 7.5.3.  Casuals.  Casuals are persons not normally part of an explosives operation but have duties that require their presence, such as quality assurance, safety or inspection personnel. 7.5.4.  Visitors.    Visitors  are  non-essential  personnel  with  limited  access.    Stop  operations when visitors are present. 7.5.5.  Posting  Personnel  Limits.    Clearly  post  personnel  limits  for  the  operations  being conducted  at  each  explosives  operating  location.    Posted  limits  will  distinguish  between AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 125 supervisors, workers, and casuals.  Locally written instructions containing personnel limits will suffice in lieu of posting. 7.5.5.1.  Do  not  post  personnel  limits  at  aircraft  parking  locations,  even  if  used  for uploading or downloading explosives. 7.5.5.2.  Do not post personnel limits at storage locations or licensed explosives storage locations. 7.6.  Explosives  Limits.  Design  explosives  operations  to  ensure  minimum  exposure  of personnel to explosives in compliance with the cardinal principle (see paragraph 1.1.2.).  Only the explosives needed to ensure a safe and efficient work flow will be present in an operating location when operations are being conducted and be limited to a one day supply.  Attempt to comply  with  compatibility  group  mixing  requirements,  if  possible,  to  minimize  the  likelihood and  severity  of  a  mishap.    Supervisors  are  responsible  for  enforcing  explosives  limits  (see Section 7K). 7.6.1.  Managing Explosives Limits.  Use the NEWQD limits from approved explosive site plans when posting limits.  Identify the HD and NEWQD explosive limits at all explosives locations, to include MCE for HD 1.2.1, NEWQD of the largest single round for HD 1.2.3, and (xx) for HD 1.2.3.  Monitor limits using thefollowing methods: 7.6.1.1.  Managed  in  the  Combat  Ammunition  System  (CAS)  or  other  Air  Force approved  databases  when  use  to  track  NEWQD  at  the  explosives  storage  or  operating locations. 7.6.1.2.  Identified on a properly displayed explosives facility license, AF IMT 2047, at a Licensed location (see Chapter 11). 7.6.1.3.  Documented in a locally written instruction (see Section 7B). 7.6.1.4.  Posted clearly at storage locations and operating locations. 7.6.2.  Posting Operating Limits.  For explosives operating locations, clearly post the HD and NEWQD limits (to include MCE for HD 1.2.1, NEWQD of the largest single round for HD 1.2.3, and (xx) for HD 1.2.3) for the operation being conducted, if less than the authorized explosives limits.  These limits may be expressed in terms of the specific explosives items, such  as  “two  Air  Intercept  Missile  (AIM)-9  missiles.”    Locally  written  instructions containing HD and NEWQD will suffice in lieu of posting (see Section 7B). 7.7.  Housekeeping.  The following are minimum precautions: 7.7.1.  Non-explosives Waste Materials. 7.7.1.1.  Do not commingle non-explosives waste materials (e.g., oily rags, combustible scrap, wood, paper, and flammable packing materials) with explosives residue. 7.7.1.2.  Place non-explosives waste materials in approved, properly marked containers. 7.7.1.3.  Place non-explosives waste material containers outside of explosives facilities, except for containers required at work locations during operations. 7.7.1.4.  Empty non-explosives waste material containers at working locations as often as needed, but at least once each workday or shift. 126 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.7.1.5.  Contact the base environmental management office for additional guidance for hazardous materials. 7.7.2.  Explosives Residue. 7.7.2.1.  Provide  grounded,  covered,  self-closing  containers  for  explosives  residue  and materials containing explosives residue (e.g., rags, clothing). 7.7.2.2.  Cover explosives residue and waste materials containing explosives residue with water  or  oil,  if  this  does  not  add  to  the  hazard.    Number  10  mineral  oil  is  useful  for covering  pyrotechnic,  tracer,  flare,  and  similar  mixtures.    If  using  water,  immediately immerse the items to reduce production of dangerous gases. 7.7.2.3.  Remove  explosives  residue  and  materials  containing  explosives  residue  at frequent  intervals  and  before  leaving  at  the  end  of  the  duty  day  or  shift.    Place  in  the disposal area or an isolated temporary collection point. 7.7.2.4.  When using isolated temporary collection points, set up time and quantity limits to  ensure  timely  movement  of  collected  material  to  the  disposal  area.    Do  not  store collected material in the disposal area. 7.7.2.5.  Dispose of explosives residue and materials containing explosives residue IAW environmental  standards  and  locally  written  instructions  approved  by  the  base environmental management office (see Section 7B). 7.7.3.  Cleaning Compounds. 7.7.3.1.  Do not use cleaning compounds containing wax or oil on conductive floors or surfaces. 7.7.3.2.  Do  not  use  cleaning  agents  that  include  caustic  alkalis  in  locations  containing explosives residue (sensitive explosives compounds may be formed). 7.7.3.3.  Remove explosives residue IAW the item TO. 7.7.3.4.  Use non-abrasive cleaning compounds; such compounds are often combustible but not volatile.  Closed cup flash point of cleaning  compounds must not be less than 230o F. 7.8.  Handling  of  Explosives.  This  paragraph  applies  to  the  handling  of  explosives  and movement of explosives within the immediate vicinity of an explosives operation. 7.8.1.  Only  trained  personnel  under  the  supervision  of  an  individual  who  understands  the hazards and risks involved in the operation are to handle explosives. 7.8.2.  Handle  detonators,  initiators,  squibs,  and  other  such  electrically  or  mechanically initiated devices in protective containers during storage, transportation, and inspection.  Use containers designed to prevent item-to-item contact.  Mark to identify the contents. 7.8.3.  Do not use bale hooks to handle explosives. 7.8.4.  Do not use nails to secure covers or make repairs on explosives containers unless there is no hazard to the explosive item or danger of penetrating protective coverings.  Exercise special care when using pneumatic- or cartridge-activated nail guns. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 127 7.8.5.  Do not tumble, drag, drop, throw, roll, or “walk” munitions.  Containers designed with skids may be pushed or pulled for positioning. 7.8.6.  Do  not  roll  un-palletized  conventional  HE  bombs  or  other  explosives  unless authorized by the item TO and lugs or other projections have been removed or if they are protected by dunnage rails. 7.8.7.  Do not use conveyors, chutes, hand trucks, or forklifts in atmospheres and locations where they will create hazards. 7.8.8.  Interlock and support sections of roller conveyors used to move explosives.  Do not use boxes containing explosives or munitions to support conveyors. 7.8.9.  Always  consider  vehicle  and  handling  equipment  type,  type  of  load,  and  prevailing weather and surface conditions when determining if safe movement is feasible. 7.8.10.  Restraining  devices  designed  for  use  with  vehicle  and  handling  equipment  will  be used IAW applicable technical orders. 7.8.11.  Do not move explosives rapidly across any non-conductive surface. 7.9.  Portable Equipment.  Ensure portable equipment meets the requirements listed in AFI 91-203 and the following requirements are adhered to: 7.9.1.  UL-listed  floodlight  systems,  mounted  on  heavy  portable  stands  and  placed  outside the  magazine  door  or  the  outdoor  working  area,  may  be  used  where  required.    Place  or protect service cords so that they cannot be walked on or run over by equipment. 7.9.2.  Flexible  cords  must  be  type  SO  hard  service  cord.    Splices  are  not  allowed.    All flexible cords, receptacles, and attachment plugs must be equipped with three prongs so that the third prong (green wire) acts as ground.  Place or protect each electrical cord so that it cannot be walked on or run over by equipment.  Do not use flexible cords in place of fixed or installed electrical wiring.  Immediately remove damaged flexible cords from service. Section 7D—Static Grounding 7.10.  Static  Electricity.  Static  electricity  is  created  when  two  different  materials  come  in contact and then are separated  again; this includes when the two materials are rubbed  against each other.  Separated charges accumulate on the two materials, creating a voltage potential that can  be  discharged  when  either  of  the  materials  is  moved  close  to  an  uncharged  or  grounded object.  This discharge can cause a mishap if it occurs through, or in the presence of, a hazardous substance  susceptible  to  electrostatic  initiation.    For  this  reason,  take  precaution  against performing unnecessary actions that lead to the buildup of static voltages, take action to avoid the prolonged storage of static voltages on personnel or equipment, and take action to discharge static  voltages  in  a  safe  and  controlled  manner  during  operations  involving  explosives.    See Section 5E for the static grounding and bonding system design and inspection requirements. 7.11.  Requirement  for  Static  Grounding.  See  paragraph  7.14.  for  static  grounding techniques and paragraph 7.15. for methods to reduce the buildup of static electricity.  Static grounding is required for: 128 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.11.1.  Personnel, equipment, and explosives, when the responsible engineering function has determined  grounding  is  necessary  for  specific  maintenance  or  electrical  test  operations; grounding requirements will normally be included in the item TO. 7.11.2.  Weapons systems in storage as required in the item TO. 7.11.3.  Personnel and equipment in hazardous locations (see Section 5C). 7.11.4.  Personnel handling EIDs (see Electrically Initiated Devices in Attachment 1).  See paragraph 7.12. for static grounding requirements for handling unpackaged EIDs. Note:  Always avoid directly touching an electrical primer. 7.11.5.  Personnel handling exposed explosives (see exposed explosives in Attachment 1). Note:  Static grounding for demolition operations are conducted per applicable 60-series TOs.   7.11.6.  Explosive components incorporating an electrical initiating system when undergoing maintenance;  assembly  to,  or  disassembly  from,  an  all-up-round  (AUR)  configuration;  or electrical connection or disconnection. Note:  Unless required by TO, static grounding is not required when replacing components of AURs incorporating an electrical initiating system when the replacement operation does not require electrical connection or disconnection. 7.11.7.  Aircraft, when explosives are being loaded or unloaded, as required in paragraph 7.13. 7.12.  Static  Grounding  for  Handling  Unpackaged  EIDs.  When  EIDs  are  unpackaged  and handled follow item TO requirements for static grounding and comply with the following: 7.12.1.  Personnel must periodically ground themselves.  Post signs at entrances and in the room  reminding  personnel  that  periodic  grounding  is  required,  except  where  compliance would create any additional personnel safety hazard.   Install one or more static  grounding bars or devices and require personnel to touch the grounding device before handling the EID and  at  frequent  intervals  while  working  to  discharge  any  static  potential  (see  paragraph 5.12.2.). 7.12.2.  Where feasible, comply with paragraphs 7.14.1.1. and  7.14.1.3. 7.12.3.  Adhere to the precautions in paragraph 7.15. 7.12.4.  Every  person  who  handles  exposed  EIDs  must  be  careful  not  to  allow  the  EID’s electrical contacts to touch any of the metal surfaces of aircraft and missile skin or structure. Additionally,  the  handler  must  actively  take  precautions  against  allowing  the  buildup  or discharge of static electric energy through the EID’s electrical contacts. 7.13.  Static  Grounding  for  Aircraft  During  Explosives  Loading  and  Unloading.  Ground combat and cargo aircraft during explosives loading or unloading operations, except as noted in paragraphs 7.13.1.  and  7.13.2.  See TO 00-25-172, Ground Servicing of Aircraft and Static Grounding/Bonding and applicable  aircraft TO for grounding procedures.  Personnel handling the  explosives  will  equalize  their  static  electrical  potential  to  that  of  the  aircraft,  vehicle  or handling equipment, before beginning operations and at frequent intervals thereafter to discharge any static buildup.  Ensure the aircraft being loaded or unloaded is not within the hazard zone of any operating transmitters (see AFI 91-208). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 129 7.13.1.  Cargo aircraft do not require grounding during engine running onload/offload (ERO) operations. 7.13.2.  Grounding  of  aircraft  during  explosives  loading  or  unloading  is  recommended  but not  required  where  there  are  unusual  parking  problems  in  operating  from  bare  or  limited bases,  nonmilitary  airfields,  host-nation  airfields,  etc.    This  exception  does  not  relieve commands from responsibility for providing proper grounding in locations where operations continue  or  where  parking  facilities  are  required  on  a  recurring  basis.    Where  static grounding  facilities  are  not  available  at  a  suitable  parking  location,  use  the  best  alternate method of reducing the hazard in the following order or precedence: 7.13.2.1.  Keep static grounding to 10,000 Ohms or less by using grounding rods. 7.13.2.2.  Equalize the static electrical potential  between the  aircraft and the vehicle or handling  equipment  used  in  loading  or  unloading  by  bonding  them  together  with  an approved static ground wire, cable, or strap (see paragraph 5.14.). Note:  It might not be feasible to bond the handling equipment to the aircraft if the handling equipment must move during the operation. 7.14.  Static Grounding Techniques.  In the absence of TO guidance, this paragraph provides techniques for accomplishing static grounding (see paragraphs 5.13. through  5.15. for further guidance). 7.14.1.  Protective  clothing  is  not  a  substitute  for  personnel  static  grounding.    Accomplish static grounding of personnel by any of the following: 7.14.1.1.  Through the use of wrist-straps connected to the facility ground. 7.14.1.2.  By  periodically  touching  a  grounded  surface  (such  as  an  airframe)  or  a grounding bar. 7.14.1.3.  By  wearing  conductive  footwear  on  conductive  floors,  mats  or  runners  (see Section 5F), if the floor, mat, or runner is properly grounded. 7.14.2.  Accomplish static grounding of equipment by any of the following: 7.14.2.1.  Through the use of a static ground wire, cable, or strap between the item to be grounded and the facility ground (see paragraph 5.14.). 7.14.2.2.  By  using  conductive  tabletops,  or  conductive  material  coverings  on  the tabletop, if the conductive surface or material is properly grounded. 7.14.3.  When making a grounding connection, attach the ground wire, cable, or strap to the item requiring grounding first, then connect the other end of the ground wire, cable, or strap to the approved facility grounding system.  This ensures that if a spark occurs, it will occur at the connection to the facility grounding system instead of at the item. 7.14.3.1.  If the existing static grounding or bonding reels were permanently attached to the facility ground when installed, a temporary grounding connection using an additional cable must be made first (when possible) following the procedure in paragraph 7.14.3. before connecting the item to the permanent system. 7.14.3.2.  When static grounding or bonding reels are installed, either in new or existing facilities, do not permanently attach them to the facility grounding system. 130 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.14.4.  When a different or new ground is needed for an item, always make the new ground connection  first  (in  the  same  manner  as  described  in  paragraph  7.14.2.)  before disconnecting the existing ground connection (make-before-break grounding).  This ensures that  the  item  is  grounded  at  all  times  while  transitioning  from  one  ground  connection  to another. 7.15.  Methods  to  Reduce  the  Hazards  of  Static  Electricity.  Personnel  can  minimize  the possibility and severity of both the buildup and discharge of hazardous static electric potentials by observing the following guidance. 7.15.1.  Whenever possible, personnel must avoid using rags or wearing outer garments made of materials having high static-generating characteristics (e.g., 100 percent polyester, nylon, rayon,  silk,  wool,  etc.).    Wool  socks,  glove  inserts,  and  caps  as  well  as  undergarments  of synthetic fabrics are less of a hazard than outer garments such as jackets or pants. 7.15.2.  Whenever possible, personnel must use rags or wear outer garments made of cotton or a cotton-synthetic blend. 7.15.2.1.  Clothing materials acceptable for flightline use (per Allowance Standard 016, Special  Purpose  Clothing  and  Personal  Equipment)  are  acceptable  for  handling munitions; this includes Gortex even though it is 100 percent nylon. 7.15.2.2.  When clothing is worn that has a high static-generating characteristic, such as Gortex or some flak vests, emphasize the techniques listed for controlling the discharge of any generated potentials. 7.15.3.  Minimize exposure to conditions which aid the buildup of static electricity such as cold, dry climates or dry, windy climates. 7.15.4.  Minimize activities which aid the buildup of static electricity such as physical motion or contact with moving non-conductive substances. 7.15.5.  Control the discharge of any generated static electric potential by touching a static grounding  bar  or  device  (or  by  equalizing  it  to  that  of  the  system  being  handled)  prior  to touching the system and at frequent intervals during operations. 7.15.6.  Minimize  activities  which  can  cause  an  uncontrolled  discharge  of  static  electric potential such as the quick or repeated removal of outer garments. Section 7E—Testing, Procedures Verification, Disassembling and Modifying Explosives Items 7.16.  Requirements for Test, Disassembly, and Modification of Explosives Items. 7.16.1.  Modify, circumstances: test,  or  disassemble  explosives items  only  under the  following 7.16.1.1.  When authorized by item TO. 7.16.1.2.  When  the  MAJCOM  and  the  weapons  system’s  program  manager  grant approval. 7.16.1.3.  When  EOD  personnel  perform  RSP,  technical  intelligence  gathering,  or  for special projects authorized per AFI 32-3001. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 131 7.16.2.  Allow only technically qualified personnel to test, disassemble, or modify explosives items. 7.16.3.  Before starting operations, supervisors must ensure all requirements of Section 7B have been met. 7.16.4.  Dry run all new procedures with inert or simulated explosives items when possible. 7.16.5.  Handling  new  or  test  munitions  (versus  operational  munitions)  requires  personnel certification.  Use inert items when possible for certification. 7.16.6.  Do not use suspended munitions (code condition J) unless specifically authorized by the munition’s program managers for: 7.16.6.1.  Dry runs. 7.16.6.2.

Follow instructions in specific weapon or weapons system TOs for testing individual explosives items or weapon systems containing explosives items.  Where there is doubt about the safety or adequacy of any test procedure or instrumentation, submit a request for advice or assistance to the program manager responsible for the TO. 7.17.2.  Ensure  electrical  test  equipment  introduced  to  a  hazardous  location  meets  the requirements of paragraph 5.4. 7.17.3.  In developing specific weapon and weapons system TOs, the responsible engineering function must consider the following guidance: 7.17.3.1.  Electrical  or  electronic  test  equipment  must  use  the  weakest  possible  power source.  If feasible, require the use of battery-powered equipment instead of a 110-volt source. 7.17.3.2.  The test power source must be incapable of initiating the explosive item being tested.  Where greater power is used, provide positive safeguards to prevent delivery of enough power to initiate the item. 7.17.3.3.  Unless  the  test  equipment  is  incapable  of  initiating  the  item  being  tested, operational shields must be provided, where needed, to protect personnel from injury (see paragraph 4.17.). 7.17.3.4.  Special  attention  must  be  given  to  the  ventilation  requirements  of  equipment containing vacuum tubes and the possibility of malfunction of equipment using resistors and other devices for limiting testing power. 132 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.17.3.5.  The explosive item, test equipment, and leads must be protected from exposure to electromagnetic (induction and radiation fields) and electrostatic energy of more than an order of magnitude less than that required to initiate an explosion (see AFI 91-208). 7.18.  Use of Live Explosives for Weapons System Testing.  Do not use live explosives items for verification, validation, or electrical testing of aircraft or other weapons systems except as follows: 7.18.1.  The conduct of research, development, test and evaluation (RDT&E) and operational test  and  evaluation  (OT&E)  flight  testing  or  “Built-In  Test”  (BIT)  checks  or  other  low-current aircraft testing with live explosives installed, as long as doing so does not conflict with  other  applicable  guidance  such  as  TO  11A-1-33,  Handling  and  Maintenance  of Explosives-Loaded Aircraft. 7.18.2.  If  an  inert  item  is  available  but  a  live  item  is  scheduled  to  be  used,  provide MAJCOM/A4W/SEW/A3T with the test plan and a risk assessment that includes appropriate personnel protection for their approval (see Section 4F). (T-1). 7.18.3.  If  an  inert  item  is  not  in  the  inventory  and  a  live  item  is  used,  only  qualified personnel  with  test  squadron  Commander  approval  will  perform  the  test.    Coordinate  test plans with the weapons safety office. (T-1). 7.18.4.  If an inert item is not in the inventory and a live item is used, operational command personnel can perform the test provided approval is obtained from, and the test plan and a risk approved  by MAJCOM/A4W/SEW/ A3T (see Section 4F).

A  procedure  for  accountability  and  reconciliation  of  all  items  used  in  the training. 7.26.1.5.  Required separation distances per paragraph 7.25. 7.26.1.6.  Required PPE. 7.26.2.  The responsible Commander will approve the plan in writing, ensuring personnel not normally associated with explosives operations and exercises are not exposed to explosives hazards. (T-1). 7.26.3.  Additional  requirements  for  EOD  training  at  off-range  locations  are  addressed  in paragraph 12.75. of this Manual. 7.27.  Military  Working  Dog  Explosives.  Military  Working  Dog  explosives  training  aids (including HD 1.1) may be transported and handled by qualified personnel in areas that provide realistic and effective training.  See AFI 31-121, Military Working Dog Program. 7.27.1.  Preclude exposure of personnel not related to the training through prudent scheduling and  selection  of  training  sites.    Provide  non-essential  personnel  separation  per  paragraph 12.77.4. 7.27.2.  Post  proper  fire  symbols  and  explosives  operation  signs  at  training  sites  (see Chapter 10). 7.27.3.  Train using locally written instructions (see Section 7B).   These instructions must include a documented post-training inventory of explosives samples ensuring no explosives are inadvertently left at the training site or discarded. 7.27.4.  Inform the weapons safety office, Fire Department, and EOD (if applicable) before conducting operations. 140 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.28.  Repairing Containers.  Except as allowed in paragraph 7.32., do not repair containers of explosives in storage facilities containing other explosives. 7.29.  Remotely  Controlled  Operations.  Provide  personnel  protection  per  paragraph  4.17. and  site  per  Chapter  12.    Develop  locally  written  instructions  to  ensure  operations  are terminated  when  operating  or  related  personnel  perform  duties  at  distances  or  locations  not providing the required protection (see Section 7B). 7.30.  Flightline  Munitions  Holding  Areas.  Where  practical  and  when  it  will  not  create  an airfield obstruction or FOD hazard identify these areas by a physical boundary (such as rope and stanchions).  Post signs to keep unauthorized personnel out of the area and to prohibit smoking within 50 feet.  Post explosives limits and ensure authorizations are not exceeded.  Provide fire extinguishers  and  post  fire  symbols.    If  providing  permanent  shelter  for  personnel,  position missiles so the shelter is out of radial alignment with the warheads.  Secure according to AFI 31-101 and DoD 5100.76-M, Physical Security Of Sensitive Conventional Arms, Ammunition, And Explosives, or return munitions to MSA for storage. 7.31.  Security  Response  Team  Ammunition the  Missile  Alert  Facility (MAF).  Ammunition issued to security response team members performing duties at the MAF is  considered  “in  use”  and  explosives  siting  and  licensing  requirements  do  not  apply.    The Security  Control  Center  (SCC)  is  the  only  authorized  location  for  maintaining  40  mm ammunition  while  in  use  inside  the  MAF.    Applicable  units  will  use  Section  7B  and  this paragraph  to  develop  locally  written  instructions  that  prescribe  acceptable  practices  to  ensure maximum  protection  of  personnel  when  security  response  team  ammunition  is  present  at  the MAF. at Section 7G—Operations in Explosives Storage Spaces 7.32.  Operations  in  Explosives  Storage  Spaces  Containing  Explosives.  AE containers will not be opened for the purpose of issuing items from storage locations.  The following operations are authorized in explosives storage spaces: 7.32.1.  Palletizing, removing and replacing shipping crates incidental to transportation. 7.32.2.  Replacing unserviceable strapping on boxes. 7.32.3.  Necessary functional testing or sampling specifically authorized by technical data for performance in a storage location (e.g., checking color-coded humidity indicators).  Testing engineers will coordinate proposed testing and sampling authorizations with the NNMSB. 7.32.4.  Opening bolted or latched special storage containers housing self-contained weapons or missiles for authorized testing, missile reprogramming, sampling or transfer to transport trailer or vehicle, and installing control surfaces and argon bottles on AIM-9 series missiles. 7.32.5.  Minor repair, cleaning, painting or re-stenciling of AUR or containers.  Solvents and paints  used  must  not  create  a  hazardous  atmosphere  within the  storage  space.  Bioenvironmental  or  fire  department  services  will  evaluate  the  potential  for  hazardous atmospheres (see Chapter 5). 7.32.6.  Removing  bomb  or  CBU  fuze  well  plugs  for  inspection  if  they  can  be  easily unscrewed as prescribed in the TO.  Remove plugs from the storage location for cleaning.  If AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 141 the  plug  binds  or  there  is  evidence  of  exposed  explosives,  move  bombs  to  an  operating location before starting repairs.  Clean threads and cavities with approved cleaning solvents. 7.32.7.  Opening  outer  containers  to  remove  inner  packages.    Complete  any  further processing of these items in an approved operating location. 7.32.8.  Opening “lite” boxes for inventory purposes. 7.32.9.  Opening containers of HD 1.4 explosives to allow inventory.  Unpack, inspect, and repack in the storage location if building content is limited to HD 1.4 items. 7.32.10.  Some repairs and minor modifications of large missile motors may be accomplished in  missile  storage  facilities.    A  risk  assessment,  reviewed  by  weapons  safety,  must  be accomplished showing the risk to move the motor is greater than the risk to perform the work in the storage location (see paragraph 4.3.). 7.32.11.  Nuclear weapons maintenance in a WSV-configured HAS or PAS, consistent with applicable weapon system safety rules. 7.32.12.  PAL  operations,  minor  surface  repair,  cleaning,  or  stenciling  of  weapons  and/or containers is authorized for nuclear weapons in any explosives storage space IAW applicable weapons system safety rules and technical orders. 7.32.13.  Other  operations  as  approved  by  AFSEC/SEW  based  on  a  risk  assessment  and mission requirements (see Chapter 4). Section 7H—Procedures in the Event of Electrical Storms 7.33.  Local  Lightning  Watch,  Warning  and  Advisory  Support.  The servicing AF weather unit will provide lighting advisories, watches, and warning support to installations allowing units time to take precautionary measures (AFVA 15-137, Operational  Weather Squadron Areas of Responsibility).    Supervisory  personnel  will  consult  with  the  supporting  weather  unit  and/or review  the  local  weather  support  plan  to  ensure  advisories,  watches,  and  warnings  provide coverage for their working areas and to become familiar with the base notification process.  In addition, weather personnel will coordinate with all installation organizations to ensure weather requirements  are  being  met,  in  accordance  with  AFMAN  15-129V2,  Air  and  Space  Weather Operations - Exploitation. 7.34.  Procedures  in  the  Event  of  Lightning  for  Conventional  AE  Only.  The  following guidelines apply when a lightning watch or warning is issued for the base: 7.34.1.  A Lightning Watch will be in effect 30 minutes prior to thunderstorms being within a five nautical mile (nm) radius of the predetermined location.  Initiate controlled termination procedures  for  all  explosives  operations  at  outdoor  locations  equipped  with  an  LPS,  at locations (outdoor and indoor) not equipped with an LPS, and facilities containing exposed explosives, explosive dust, or explosive vapor. 7.34.2.  A Lightning Warning will be in effect whenever any lightning is occurring within a 5 nm radius of the predetermined location. 7.34.2.1.  Immediately  provide  personnel  protection  equivalent  to  PTR  distance  from explosives facilities containing exposed explosives, explosive dust, or explosive vapor, regardless  of  whether  the  facility  is  equipped  with  an  LPS;  this  includes  providing 142 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 locations  (indoor  and  outdoor, protection equivalent to PTR for all locations within the PTR arc.  PTR distances will be based on airblast overpressure only (minimum fragment distances do not apply). 7.34.2.2.  Explosives operations in facilities equipped with an LPS (including HAS/PAS) may continue (except where noted in paragraph 7.34.2.1.); however, assess the need and urgency for doing so.  Cease operations involving EIDs that are uncapped, unplugged, or susceptible  to  electro-static  discharge  and  vacate  the  maintenance  bay  where  these operations  are  located.    Evacuation  of  the  non-maintenance  administrative  areas  is  not required. 7.34.2.3.  Immediately  provide  personnel  protection  equivalent  to  PTR  distance  from explosives include  parked  explosives-laden conveyances  and  flightline  PES  locations)  not  having  an  LPS;  this  includes  providing protection equivalent to PTR for all locations within the PTR arc of a facility having an LPS.    PTR  distances  will  be  based  on  airblast  overpressure  only  (minimum  fragment distances do not apply). 7.34.2.4.  When intercontinental  ballistic  missile  (ICBM)  operations  cannot  be immediately  evacuated,  (e.g.,  due  to  protection  level  resources  or  a  transporter-erector being in its upright position and the missile being raised or lowered) use technical orders to ensure the safety and security of personnel and weapons. 7.34.2.5.  Cease all explosives operations at outdoor locations equipped with an LPS and not specifically mentioned in the paragraphs above. 7.34.2.6.  Sites/explosives  operations  not  requiring  an  ESP  and  licensed  locations  not requiring  LPS  are  excluded  from  lightning  evacuation  as  described  in  this  paragraph.  (See shelter criteria in AFI 91-203 for additional lightning response requirements). to 7.34.3.  See Section 5H for additional LPS information. 7.35.  Procedures in the Event of Lightning for Nuclear Weapons. 7.35.1.  Locations  supporting  nuclear  weapons  operations  will  request  forecast  lighting advisories  and  observe  lightning  advisories  for  lighting  within  10  nautical  miles  of  their location  from  their  servicing  weather  unit.    Local  procedures  for  these  advisories  are documented in Section 7H.  In addition, DoDM 3150.02 prescribes response actions when 10 nautical mile lightning advisories are issued. 7.35.2.  See Section 5H for additional LPS information. Section 7I—Explosives Storage Requirements 7.36.  Selection of Explosives Storage Method. 7.36.1.  ECM  storage  is  preferable  for  all  types  of  explosives  (see  Section  6C).    From  an explosives  safety  and  reliability  standpoint,  give  priority  to  the  use  of  ECMs  for  items requiring protection from the elements, long-term storage, or high security protection. 7.36.2.  Indoor storage is preferable for all types of explosives and is mandatory for bulk HE, solid propellants and pyrotechnics, except as allowed by paragraph 7.41.2.2. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 143 7.36.3.  Outdoor storage is considered a temporary expedient.  Use only when approved by the MAJCOM, or as allowed per Section 6D barricaded modules. 7.36.4.  Where  outdoor  storage  is  approved,  consider  the  use  of  barricaded  open  storage modules for high-density storage in a limited land area (see Section 6D). 7.36.5.  Any magazine or warehouse-type building that gives protection from the weather and meets  QD  and  security  requirements  is  allowed  for  storing  explosives  HD  1.3  and  1.4 materials. 7.36.6.  Units  may  use  other  types  of  standard  magazines  built  according  to  approved drawings.    MAJCOMs  may  approve  use  of  existing  magazines  of  other  descriptions (including contractors' facilities) if they provide the proper degree of protection and safety. 7.37.  Explosives Storage in Operating Locations.  Explosives may be stored in an operating location when operations are not being conducted, provided all other storage criteria are met. 7.38.  Explosives Storage Facility Maintenance. 7.38.1.  Practice good housekeeping in all locations. 7.38.2.  Keep structures in good condition and suitable for the storage of munitions types and hazard divisions involved. 7.38.3.  Certain  items  containing  explosives  have  stringent  temperature  limitations  (see applicable TO).  Take precautions to ensure these limits are not exceeded. 7.39.  Explosives Stocks Maintenance. 7.39.1.  Keep outer containers in good condition and securely closed. 7.39.2.  Stacks  of  containers  must  be  stable  and  arranged  in  magazines  or  other  approved locations according to storage drawings or directives. 7.39.3.  Provide  ventilation  when  required  by  civil  engineering,  logistics  and  health directives. 7.39.4.  Block  storage  is  allowed  if  stack  ventilation  is  maintained  when  required  by  civil engineering, logistics or health directives. 7.39.5.  Maintain aisles so each stack may be inspected. 7.39.6.  Inert  and  live  AE  or  munitions  components  may  be  stored  together,  however, physically separate inert items from the live items they represent. 7.40.  Marking of Explosives Stocks. 7.40.1.  Keep  boxes  properly  closed  and  clearly  marked  to  show  contents  and  quantity.  Requirements  of  TO  11A-1-10,  General  Instructions--Munitions  Serviceability  Procedures and the item TO apply. 7.40.2.  For dangerously unserviceable, unserviceable, or suspended lots, mark each package or stack to show its exact status.  The markings must be clear to prevent inadvertent issue or loss of information. 7.40.3.  Properly packed AE may not be stored with loose AE items, single inner packages (nonmetal), or explosives in unserviceable containers. 144 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 7.40.4.  Properly packed AE may be stored with nonstandard boxes of AE IAW CG. 7.41.  Munitions in Austere Areas. 7.41.1.  The  austere  area  provisions  of  paragraph  7.41.2.  for  explosives  storage  areas  are authorized for use in: 7.41.1.1.  All zones where hostilities exist. 7.41.1.2.  Areas approved by Pacific Air Forces  (PACAF), United States Air Forces in Europe-United States Air Forces Africa (USAFE-AFAFRICA) and United States Central Command  Air  Forces  (AFCENT),  where  arrangement  under  paragraph  13.5.  allows their application. 7.41.1.3.  All bare or limited bases. 7.41.1.4.  Other areas as may be approved by AFSEC/SEW. 7.41.2.  Austere Area Provisions. 7.41.2.1.  Minimum separations must prevent simultaneous detonation of explosives on opposite  sides  of  an  approved  barricade  and  minimize  the  possibility  of  later,  non-simultaneous propagating explosions.  Use greater separations where possible. 7.41.2.2.  Open  storage  is  authorized  for  all  HD  of  munitions  and  explosives.    Give priority for cover to items requiring protection from the elements, considering the type of packing material involved. 7.41.2.3.  Avoid single stacks of large quantities of mass-detonating explosives.  Smaller stacks may limit losses due to accident or enemy action and often result in decreased land area  requirement.    Smaller  stacks  reduce  the  distance  required  between  the  explosives storage  area  and  other  exposures,  such  as  flightline  areas,  inhabited  buildings,  or  bulk POL storage. 7.41.2.4.  When normal aboveground magazine separation is not feasible, use barricaded open storage modules (see Section 6D).  Large quantities of explosives may be stored in this manner with relative safety. 7.41.2.5.  If land is scarce and covered storage is necessary, consider the use of approved steel  arch  ECMs.    These  sectionalized,  corrugated-arch  structures  allow  storage  of maximum amounts of mass-detonating explosives with minimum space between ECMs.  They are available in any practical length in widths up to 30 feet.  The commonly-used earth  cover  gives  acceptable  protection  against  propagation  of  an  explosion  from  one ECM to another. 7.41.2.6.  Site tri-service or joint-use storage facilities using DoD 6055.09-M. 7.42.  Privately-owned  Ammunition.  Store  privately-owned  ammunition  allowed  on  an  Air Force installation as follows: 7.42.1.  Base housing residents (i.e., military families living in government-provided family housing) can store their privately-owned ammunition in their quarters. 7.42.2.  Billeting and dormitory residents cannot store their privately-owned ammunition in their quarters. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 145 7.42.3.  Store privately-owned ammunition in a licensed or sited explosives storage location (except as noted in paragraph 11.25.). 7.42.4.  Do not store privately-owned ammunition in an MSA (see paragraph 3.13.1.1.). 7.43.  Government  Arms  and  Ammunition.  MAJCOMs  may  authorize  the  storage  of  DoD firearms  in  explosives  storage  facilities  within  the  MSA  to  meet  operational  commitments.  Coordinate with MAJCOM/A4/SEW to authorize storage. Section 7J—Storage and Compatibility Principles 7.44.  Storage and Compatibility Principles. 7.44.1.  AE may not be stored with dissimilar substances or articles (e.g., Class 3, Flammable and combustible liquid; Class 8, Corrosive material) that may present additional hazards to the AE unless they have been assessed to be compatible (see paragraph 7.44.5.). 7.44.2.  AE  may  not  be  stored  with  unrelated  non-AE  items  (e.g.,  powered  lift  trucks, dunnage, empty boxes, unused pallets, excess packing material). 7.44.3.  AE may be stored with related noncombustible equipment as necessary to support approved contingency or war plans requiring ready use of such equipment. 7.44.4.  Not-Regulated AE and AE assigned to Classes 2 through 9 may have a CG assigned.  When so assigned, the AE may be stored with Class 1 AE IAW the CG. 7.44.5.  AE in damaged packaging, in suspect condition, or with characteristics that increase risk in storage, are not compatible with other AE and will be stored separately as CG L. 7.44.6.  Treat AE received without an assigned hazard classification as HD 1.1L and place in segregated storage.  Contact AFSEC/SEW for assistance. 7.44.7.  Segregate  serviceable  AE  from  unserviceable  AE,  including  lots  suspended  from issue and use.  Put them in a separate facility or segregate them physically within the same facility.  If they remain in the same facility, clearly separate the unserviceable items using ropes, tape, painted lines or other highly visible means. 7.45.  Found-on-Base AE.  The following provisions apply to found-on-base AE: 7.45.1.  Treat unidentified found-on-base AE of an unknown hazard division as HD 1.1L.  If local  munitions  or  EOD  technicians  can  identify  a  found-on-base  AE  item  sufficiently  to determine that it is the same as a stock listed, hazard classified item, then it may be stored IAW that hazard classification. 7.45.2.  Found-on-base  AE  will  not  be  placed  in  a  licensed  facility,  regardless  of  hazard classification.  Ball cartridges, .50 cal and smaller, and all gauge of shotgun shells, may be treated as HD 1.4C; these same items may be treated as HD 1.4S if this hazard classification can be definitely established. 7.45.3.  Recognize that unidentified AE may contain viable chemical or biological warfare agents, including recovered munitions from historic burial or off-shore disposal sites.  If AE is  suspected  to  contain  chemical  or  biological  warfare  agents,  activate  local  incident management  system  and  wait  for  confirmation  from  the  appropriate  agency  (Fire Department,  Emergency  Management,  and  Bioenvironmental  Engineering).    Contact  the 146 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 MAJCOM  Treaty  Compliance  Officer  if  the  item  is  identified  as  a  chemical  or  biological munitions item. 7.46.  Dangerously Unserviceable AE.  Treat dangerously unserviceable AE as CG L and store in  an  isolated  location  separated  from  other  AE  storage  facilities  by  IMD.    Dangerously unserviceable  items  are  those  having  a  substantially  greater  probability  of  inadvertent  or unintentional activation than a normal item (e.g., UXO, discarded military munitions (DMM), and  components  thereof,  even  when  rendered  safe;  or  other  unserviceable  explosives  or components that have undergone abnormal or unknown environments (i.e., aircraft crash, natural disaster, or other unknown conditions). Section 7K—Mixed Compatibility Group Storage 7.47.  Mixed Compatibility Group Storage  .  Separate storage of AE by HD and type provides the highest degree of safety.   Because such storage is generally not feasible, mixed storage—subject to compliance with this Manual—is normally implemented when such storage facilitates safe operation and promotes overall storage efficiency.  The CG assigned to AE indicates what can be stored with the AE without increasing significantly either an accident's probability or, for a given quantity, the magnitude of an accident’s effects.  AE of different CG may only be mixed in storage as indicated in Table 7.1., or as follows: 7.47.1.  AE packaged and configured for rapid response (e.g., Rapid Deployment Force) may be  mixed  without  complying  with  the  compatibility  and  mixing  requirements,  as operationally required to achieve the optimum load needed by the intended receiving troops.  Limit  the  MCE  allowable  at  any  of  these  storage  sites  to  8,818  lbs  NEWQD.    When computing  QD  requirements  for  such  sites,  Chapter  12  applies.    However,  exclude  the following AE for NEWQD determination at such storage sites: 7.47.1.1.  Propelling charges in HD 1.2 fixed, semi-fixed, mortar, and rocket AE. 7.47.1.2.  The NEWQD of HD 1.3 items, except at sites that contain only HD 1.3 items.  At such sites, HD 1.3 QD applies. Note:  In the application of this paragraph, to separate loading AE, the explosive weight of propelling charges is generally excluded when matched pairs of projectiles and propelling charges are at the site.  However, if the quantity of propelling charges at the site exceeds the maximum usable for the quantity of projectiles at the site, sum the explosive weights of all propelling charges and projectiles at the site for NEWQD determination. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 147 Table 7.1.  Storage Compatibility Mixing Chart.  Notes.: 1.  An “X” at an intersection indicates that the groups may be combined in storage.  Otherwise, mixing is either prohibited or restricted per Note 2 below. 2.  A “Z” at an intersection indicates that when warranted by operational considerations or magazine non-availability, and when safety is not sacrificed, mixed storage of limited quantities (equal or less than 8,818 lbs total NEWQD) of some items from different groups is acceptable subject to approval from at least the MSA Commander.  Approval must be in writing and must be kept on site.   3.  Mixed storage of items within groups where no X or Z exists at that pair’s intersection, are authorized, except items in CG A, K and L, provided quantities are limited to 1,000 lbs total NEWQD or less and approved by a deviation (see paragraph 1.4.).   4.  Examples of acceptable storage combinations are: a) HD 1.1A initiating explosives with HD 1.1B fuzes not containing two or more effective protective features and b) HD 1.3C bulk propellants or bagged propelling charges with HD 1.3G pyrotechnic substances. 5.  Equal numbers of separately packaged components of hazard classified complete rounds of any single type of AE (i.e., missiles, general purpose bombs, etc.) may be stored together.  They may also be stored with assembled rounds made up from these components.  When so stored, compatibility is that of the complete round.  That is, group H for WP rounds; group D, E, or F, as appropriate, for HE rounds.  (The “equal number” provision is intended to limit the material stored to enough packaged components to make up the desired number of complete rounds.  It is 148 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 not necessary to unpack extra components from normal packaging to make an “equal numbers” condition.) 6.  CG K requires not only separate storage from other groups, but also may require separate storage within the group.  AFSEC/SEW will determine which items under CG K may be mixed with other items and which must be kept separate, when such a requirement develops.  Request AFSEC/SEW determination through MAJCOM/SEW.  Approval must be in writing and must be kept on site. 7.  AE classed outside Class 1 may be assigned the same CG as Class 1 AE containing similar hazard features, but where the explosive hazard predominates.  Non-Class 1 AE and Class 1 AE assigned the same CG may be stored together. 8.  Ammunition designated “Practice” or “Target Practice” by NSN and nomenclature may be combined with the fully-loaded ammunition that it simulates (e.g., 2.75-inch target practice rockets with WP rockets). 9.  For purposes of mixing, all AE must be packaged in its standard storage and shipping container.  AE containers will not be opened for issuing items from storage locations.  Outer containers may be opened in storage locations for inventorying and for magazines storing only HD 1.4 items, unpacking, inspecting, and repackaging the HD 1.4 ammunition (See paragraph 7.31.). 10.  When using the “Z” mixing authorized by Note 2 above for articles of either CG B or CG F, each will be segregated in storage from articles of other CGs by means that prevent propagation (i.e., IMD) of CG B or CG F articles to articles of other CGs. 11.  If dissimilar HD 1.6N AE are mixed together and have not been tested to ensure non-propagation, the mixed AE are individually considered to be HD 1.2.1 D or HD 1.2.2 D based on their NEWQD or overriding fragmentation characteristics for purposes of transportation and storage.  When mixing CG N AE with CG B through CG G or with CG S, see Section 12C to determine the HD for the mixture. 12.  Articles in group L must be segregated in a separate facility or meet the requirements of paragraph 6.29. - multicubes.  Group L articles are not compatible with other articles in group L unless they are identical items. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 149 Chapter 8 EXPLOSIVES TRANSPORTATION Section 8A—Introduction 8.1.  Introduction.  This Chapter gives safety requirements for transporting explosives and for operating vehicles and MHE in explosives locations.  In-use ammunition items that accompany security  forces  or  other  defense  forces  are  not  governed  by  transportation  rules.    Physically secure all onboard ammunition not loaded in a weapon or secured to an individual for immediate use during transport. QD criteria do not apply to munitions and explosives in the transportation mode.  Take precautions to ensure minimum exposure of people and property during all phases of transportation.  Limit the time munitions and explosives are in the transportation mode to the absolute minimum necessary to complete the task. Section 8B—Explosives Transportation Standards 8.2.  Federal  Regulation.  49  CFR  regulates  commercial  shipments  of  hazardous  material, including  explosives,  by  rail,  motor  vehicle,  cargo  aircraft  and  ship  within  the  US  (except maritime  explosives).    49  CFR  rules  only  apply  on  military  installations  when  specifically prescribed.    For  transporting  explosives  and  munitions  on  an  Air  Force  installation  use  the criteria  is  this  Manual.    For  transporting  military  explosives  and  munitions  off  an  Air  Force installation, but in an Air Force conveyance and operated by Air Force personnel, apply the rules in  49  CFR  as  prescribed  in  Air  Force  and  Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  directives.    See paragraph 8.3. for a list of applicable publications. 8.3.  DoD  Directives.  In  addition  to  this  Manual,  the  following  directives  apply  to  military shipments  of  hazardous  materials  within  the  defense  transportation  system:    AFJI  11-204,Operational Procedures for Aircraft Carrying Hazardous Material; AFI 13-526, Volume 1, Prime Nuclear Airlift Force Operations; AFMAN 24-204, Preparing Hazardous Materials for Military Air Shipment; AFMAN 24-306, Operation of Air Force Government Motor Vehicles, TO  11N-45-51,  Transportation  of  Nuclear  Materiel;  General  Shipping  and  Limited  Life Component (LLC) Data, plus supplements;  Defense Transportation Regulation (DTR) 4500.9-R-Part  II,  Cargo  Movement;  AFJI  24-210,  Packaging  of  Hazardous  Material;  AFI  24-203, Preparation  and  Movement  of  Air  Force  Cargo;  AFI  24-301,  Vehicle  Operations,  and  MIL-STD-129, Military Marking for Shipment and Storage.   8.4.  Local  Laws  Regulating  Transportation  of  Explosives  and  Dangerous  Articles.  Each state  and  nearly  all  local  and  foreign  governments  have  laws  or  ordinances  regulating transportation of  explosives and other dangerous articles  within their jurisdiction.

Explosives,  to  be  acceptable for  transportation  by  any  mode,  must  have  an  assigned  hazard  classification  (HD;  storage 150 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 compatibility group; DOT class, markings, shipping name and label; and United Nations serial number),  except  as  noted  in  paragraph  8.6.    (T-0).    Developmental  items,  test  articles, components,  and  certain  commercial  items  that  contain  explosives,  but  without  a  final classification  must  be  assigned  an  IHC.  (T-0).    See  Chapter  3  for  hazard  classification procedures. (T-0) 8.6.  Commercial for Transportation.  Commercial  explosive  items  purchased  for  official  use  must  have  a  hazard classification assigned IAW TO 11A-1-47 before transportation and use, except as provided in this paragraph. (T-0).  Store, transport, or offer for transportation, commercial explosives that have not been examined, hazard classified, and approved by DoD IAW 49 CFR Part 173.56 (b) (2) provided one of the following paragraphs is complied with: Requirements Explosives Hazard Classification 8.6.1.  The  explosive  has  been  designated,  in  writing,  by  the  Associate  Administrator  for Hazardous  Materials  Safety  (AAHMS),  Research  and  Special  Programs  Administration, DOT, as “Not Regulated.” 8.6.2.  The explosive has been approved for transportation, in writing, by the AAHMS in a Classification  of  Explosives,  Competent  Authority  Approval,  or  in  a  Confirmation  of Acceptability of a foreign Competent  Authority  Approval, and the hazard classification of the explosive is HD 1.4S. 8.7.  Compatibility  of  Explosives  During  Transportation.  49  CFR  Part177.848  provides guidance for separating and segregating hazardous materials, including different explosives, in the various modes of commercial transportation.  Explosives transported on a public highway by Air  Force  motor  vehicles,  operated  by  Air  Force  personnel,  will  be  separated  and  segregated using  the  rules  in  49  CFR,  except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Manual  or  other  applicable military directives.  When an item containing explosives is assigned to other than Hazard Class 1 because  of  the  predominant  hazard,  a  compatibility  group  is  still  assigned  (see  paragraph 3.5.1.2.).    For  these  items,  compatibility  for  transportation,  and  temporary  storage  incident  to transportation,  must  be  based  on  rules  for  the  assigned  hazard  class,  not  on  the  compatibility group.    The  compatibility  group  for  these  items  applies  only  to  long  term  storage.    Cargo-configured items that may be shipped in the same Air Force aircraft are listed in AFMAN 24-204 and  TO  11N-45-51  series.    Procedures  for  submitting  a  compatibility  waiver  for  air transportation of explosives is contained in AFMAN 24-204.  The following exceptions to the above standards are permitted: 8.7.1.  Development  of  new  items  for  transportation  by  combining  previously  hazard classified components into an increased state of assembly to meet a valid military need.  Use normal hazard classification procedures in TO 11A-1-47 to obtain the hazard classification approval for transportation applicable to the new configuration. 8.7.2.  Movement  of  assembled  or  partially  assembled  explosive  items  between  servicing explosives locations and aircraft loading points or other such locations on the same military installation, when the assembly has not been classed and approved as provided in TO 11A-1-47, but is necessary to meet valid operational requirements.  If the operational requirement is expected to continue or can be anticipated, seek hazard classification approval. 8.7.3.  Movement in a military vehicle of minimum quantities of explosive items necessary for  demolition  operations,  to  include  proficiency  training.    Blasting  caps,  demolition AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 151 explosives  and  unserviceable  (but  not  dangerously  unserviceable)  munitions  may  be transported by the same vehicle, provided MAJCOM approves the mixing of all applicable compatibility  groups.    See  paragraph  8.22.  for  restrictions  concerning  the  carrying  of explosives inside passenger compartments. 8.7.4.  Transport  dangerously  unserviceable  munitions  in  a  separate  military  vehicle.    If transport  in  a  separate  military  vehicle  is  not  possible,  segregate  and  sandbag  from  other explosives being transported.  Transport dangerously unserviceable munitions according to paragraph 8.11.  8.7.5.  Movement  by  a  DoD-owned  vehicle,  operated  by  DoD  personnel,  of  mixed  loads consisting of components (not otherwise compatible for transportation), in the numbers and of  the  type’s  necessary  to  assemble  a  number  of  complete  rounds  of  a  single  type,  when essential to meet operational requirements, and  when separate (unmixed) movement is not feasible.  See DTR 4500.9-R-Part II for procedures where such exceptions to compatibility rules are required. 8.7.6.  Movement by a DoD-owned vehicle, operated by DoD personnel, or a mixed load of small  quantities  of  items  (not  to  exceed  1,000  pounds  total  NEWQD)  from  compatibility groups B through J, N, and S.  The NEWQD of HD 1.4S items need not be included. 8.7.7.  Movement by Security Forces of mixed loads of ammunition in performance of their duties. 8.8.  Compatibility  of  Explosives  During  Temporary  Storage.  Table  7.1.,  49  CFR,  or AFMAN  24-204  criteria  may  be  used  for  temporary  mixing  of  explosives  while  undergoing packing  and  unpacking  operations  or  while  in  temporary  storage  awaiting  shipment.    Do  not store other dangerous articles with these explosives.  Shipping, receiving and storage facilities must comply with QD criteria of this Manual for the HD involved. (T-1). Section 8D—Packaging for Explosives Transportation 8.9.  Packaging.  Packaging of explosives offered for shipment must comply with TO 11A-1-10, 49 CFR, Parts173.1 – 173.477, or AFMAN 24-204 specifications, as appropriate. (T-0).  Follow these instructions: 8.9.1.  Locally made packaging must meet the construction and marking requirements in 49 CFR, or must conform to a military Certification of Equivalency for the item being packed.     (T-0). 8.9.2.  Mark  each  package  to  identify  contents.    The  DOT  marking  consist  of  the  Proper Shipping Name; United Nations Identification Number; and the DOT EX-number, national stock number or other product code as specified in the hazard classification.  See AFMAN 24-204, TO 11N-45-51,  or the Joint Hazard Classification System (JHCS), as appropriate.  For  Transportation  Protective  Service  Material,  mark  IAW  Defense  Transportation Regulations and MIL-STD-129. (T-0). 8.9.3.  If an item is not listed in above references, contact 406 SCM/GULAA, Hill AFB UT 84056-5609 for the required data. 152 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 8.9.4.  Do  not  open  or  repair  a  package  in  a  railcar,  motor  vehicle,  or  aircraft  unless  it  is essential for inflight safety or to safely unload a damaged package.  Avoid re-nailing boxes because of the potential to strike the explosives with the nail. 8.9.5.  If a package is damaged or defective, remove it from the transporting vehicle at the earliest opportunity for repair. 8.10.  Shipment  of  Damaged  Explosives  or  Explosives  that  Failed  To  Function.  If  it  is necessary to ship an explosive item that has been damaged, subjected to abnormal force or has failed  to  function,  ask  the  responsible  program  manager  for  shipping,  packing,  marking  and safety instructions.  For damaged or failed-to-function AE, EOD must determine that it is safe to ship  prior  to  munitions  requesting  shipping  instructions  from  the  program  manager  for  the munition. (T-1). 8.11.  Transporting Dangerously Unserviceable Explosive Items for Disposal.  Package and mark dangerously unserviceable items and explosive residue such as partially burned signals as specified  in  the  item  TO  or  EOD  technical  publications.    Consult  EOD  before  transporting dangerously unserviceable items and explosive residue other than as approved by DOT.  DoD personnel  who  are  properly  trained  in  procedures  to  be  followed  and  specific  hazards  of  the material may routinely transport dangerously unserviceable items and explosive residue.  Inspect vehicles using DD Form 626, Motor Vehicle Inspection (Transporting Hazardous Material). Section 8E—Explosives Movement Routes on Base 8.12.  Explosives  Movement  Routes  on  Base.  Designate  the  safest  possible  primary  and alternate explosives movement routes to cover all phases of movement.  Identify routes and any limitations on explosives quantities by hazard division on base maps.  Avoid built-up areas and key, mission-oriented facilities and equipment to the maximum extent possible.  Movements of munitions within an MSA, airfield or to and from licensed storage locations and transportation of explosives in support of the training of working dogs are not restricted to designated routes. Section 8F—Incoming and In-transit Explosives Shipments 8.13.  Incoming Explosives Shipments.  Review guidance in the Transportation Facilities Guide maintained  by  Surface  Deployment  and  Distribution  Command  (SDDC).    Contact  the  base transportation  officer  for  this  guide.    The  base  transportation  officer  is  responsible  for maintaining  the  base  information  current  in  the  SDDC  database.    Clearly  state  in  notification procedures  the  NEWQD  (and  MCE  if  applicable),  by  HD,  that  can  be  received  at  unloading facilities (e.g., railheads, ports, hot cargo pads, etc). 8.14.  In-Transit Explosives Shipments/Secure Holding.  When the SDDC or carrier requests temporary  storage  for  in-transit  shipments  of  explosives,  DoD  installations  must  accept  arms ammunition  and  explosives  (AA&E)  shipments  for  safe  haven  or  secure  hold  regardless  of arrival time or final destination. (T-0).  If safe haven or secure hold cannot be provided, the DoD activity will provide, in coordination with civil law enforcement authorities, assistance and escort to a suitable location. (T-1).  Protection of shipment will be commensurate with the sensitivity of the  AA&E.    Under  safe  haven  conditions  or  secure  hold,  explosive  safety  quantity  distance requirements must be considered, but these requirements will not eliminate the responsibility to provide safe haven or secure hold to mitigate shipment vulnerability.  See paragraph 1.5. for an AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 153 event  waiver  if  a  properly  sited  location  is  not  used.    Furthermore,  DoD  installations  and activities  will  provide  a  secure  holding  or  safe  haven  for  A&E  shipments  during  emergency (vehicle  breakdowns,  criminal/terrorist  threat,  etc.)  and  non-emergency  conditions.  (T-1). Coordinate  with  the  base  transportation  officer  to  ensure  the  Transportation  Facilities  Guide correctly reflects the NEWQD (and MCE if applicable), by HD, that can be held at the Secure Explosives  Holding  Area.    See  Defense  Transportation  Regulation  (DTR),  Part  II,  Chapter 205.Q, AFI 31-101, Integrated Defense, and AFI 10-2501, Air Force Emergency Management (EM) Program Planning and Operations, for information. 8.15.  Inspection  of  Incoming  Explosives  Shipments.  A  representative  of  the  Logistics Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)  Commander  will  inspect  all  incoming  motor  vehicles  carrying Hazard Class 1 explosives and other hazard class items that carry an explosives compatibility group,  to  include  HD  1.4  shipments  more  than  1,001  lbs,  at  a  designated  inspection  station before further routing on base. (T-1). 8.15.1.  Inspection stations do not require explosives siting if they are limited to the activities described in paragraph 12.57.  Apply QD criteria per Chapter 12 if the inspection station is also  used  as  explosives  storage  or  suspect  vehicle  holding  area.    Do  not  perform  vehicle inspections  at  the  station  if  it  is  in  use  as  an  explosives  storage  area  or  suspect  vehicle holding area.  The inspection station may be used as an interchange yard.  Remove vehicles promptly after the inspection is completed. 8.15.2.  Inspect  Defense  Transportation  System  (DTS)  scheduled  vehicles  using  DD  Form 626.  Inspect non-DTS scheduled vehicles using a locally generated form approved by the LRS Commander and the WSM or use the DD Form 626. 8.15.3.  Once a vehicle has passed the initial inspection, a visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo may be done at any suitable location, including the unloading point. 8.15.4.  Move  any  vehicle  found  or  suspected  to  be  in  a  hazardous  condition  to  a  suspect vehicle holding area, isolated from other locations, by the proper QD criteria per paragraph 12.62., unless it is more hazardous to move the vehicle. 8.16.  Inspection  of  Outgoing  Explosives  Shipments.  This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  the departure of in-transit explosives shipments.  Shipping activities will inspect all vehicles to be used for off-base shipments of explosives before and after loading for compliance with safety regulations. (T-1). 8.16.1.  Complete  DD  Form  626  according  to  DTR  4500.9-R-  Part  II,  Chapter  204, paragraph G.1.  Inspect non-DTS scheduled vehicles using a locally generated form approved by the LRS Commander and the WSM. 8.16.2.  Maintain a record of the vehicle number, the type of explosive cargo, and the number of each seal applied to the vehicle. 8.16.3.  Drivers must be qualified to operate the vehicle and knowledgeable of the explosives being transported and associated hazards. (T-1).  In addition, Air Force civilian drivers must have a Commercial Driver’s License, with a hazardous materials endorsement, to transport explosives off a military installation. (T-1).  See AFI 24-301, Vehicle Operations. 8.16.4.  Use  DD  Form  2890,  DoD  Multimodal  Dangerous  Goods  Declaration  to  instruct drivers on the nature of their cargo, firefighting methods, and other specific precautions for 154 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 the particular shipment. Information on the preparation and use of DD Form 2890 is in DTR 4500.9-R-Part II, Chapter 204, paragraph G.2. 8.16.5.  At overseas units, use bilingual instructions on the DD Form 626 where needed. 8.16.6.  Use  applicable  technical  data  when  special  purpose  vehicles  are  authorized  to transport explosive loads. 8.16.7.  Develop  written  procedures  with  the  base  Logistics  Readiness  Squadron  to  ensure procedures  and  requirements  for  military  vehicles  or  drivers  transporting  explosives (assembled or partially assembled in a delivery mode) across or on public highways from one part of a base to another are compliant with the DTR 4500.9-R-Part II, Chapters 204 and 205.  Examples may include the transportation of munitions from a preparation area across the highway to the main base flightline, or on the highway to a nearby auxiliary field.  If this is  a  daily  operation,  there  must  be  an  agreement  with  local  authorities  on  any  local restrictions to be imposed.  OCONUS locations must comply with host-nation requirements, including  any  notice  requirements  contained  in  host-nation  law  or  applicable  international agreements.    If  host-nation  law  or  applicable  international  agreements  are  silent  on notification,  OCONUS  locations  (outside  of  operational  areas)  should  consider  notifying host-nation authorities of the movement of explosives regardless of any legal obligation to do so. 8.16.8.  Externally  inspect  commercial  carriers  used  to  move  explosives  over  public highways from one area to another area of an installation before entering the second area.  Inspection is not required if the carrier was escorted or under surveillance en route. 8.17.  Interchange  Yards.  Use  this  location  for  the  exchange  of  tractor-trailers  between  the common  carrier  and  the  base  activity  involved.    Interchange  yards  do  not  require  explosives siting  if  they  are  limited  to  the  activities  described  in  paragraph  12.58.    Apply  QD  if  the interchange  yard  is  also  used  as  explosives  storage  or  suspect  vehicle  holding  area.    Do  not perform vehicle interchange operations at the yard if it is in use as an explosives storage area or suspect  vehicle  holding  area.    The  interchange  yard  may  be  used  as  an  inspection  station.  Remove vehicles promptly. 8.18.  Holding  Yards.  Move  explosives-loaded  vehicles  to  a  holding  yard  if  they  cannot  be dispatched  to  unloading  points  promptly.    See  paragraph  12.59.  for  holding  yard  siting requirements.  Holding yards may be used for interchange and inspection activities. 8.19.  Classification  Yards.  Where  the  volume  of  vehicle  traffic  necessitates,  establish  a classification  yard  primarily  for  receiving,  classifying,  switching,  and  dispatching  explosives-laden vehicles.  Classification  yards do not require explosives siting if they  are limited to the activities described in paragraph 12.60.  Apply QD criteria per Chapter 12 if the classification yard is also used as explosives storage or suspect vehicle holding area.  Classification yards may also be used as interchange yards and vehicles will be removed promptly. 8.20.  AE  Transportation  Mode  Change  Locations.  Transportation  mode  change  locations require explosives siting as per paragraph 12.59. (T-1).  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 155 Section 8G—Transportation and Movement of Explosives by Motor Vehicle and MHE 8.21.  General.  This  section  covers  the  transport  and  handling  of  explosives  by  DoD  motor vehicle and MHE.  The requirements of this section also apply to DoD rental vehicles when used to  transport  DoD  explosives  on  military  installations.    Do  not  transport  DoD  explosives  in Privately Owned Vehicles (POV) s under any circumstance. 8.21.1.  Chock explosive loaded vehicles when parked and the driver is not behind the wheel.  Chocking MHE or MMHE is not required if the explosives load is lowered and completely resting on the ground. 8.21.2.  Chock other forms of explosives loaded MMHE and MHE (e.g., trailers, universal ammunition loading systems (UALS), etc.) when parked and/or left unattended. 8.22.  Transporting Explosives in Passenger Compartments.  Do not transport explosives in a passenger compartment of a vehicle, except as authorized below. 8.22.1.  Minimum  essential  personnel  and  limited  quantities  of  HD  1.4,  1.3,  and  1.2.2 explosives,  as  approved  by  the  local  OI,  may  be  transported  together  in  cargo  portion  of vehicles  (including  Metro  type  vans  used  on  the  flightline)  or  in  vehicles  used  as  runway supervisory units. 8.22.2.  Egress system assembled components may be transported in the cargo compartment of Metro-type vehicles. 8.22.3.  For  emergency  responses  in  vehicles  without  separate  cargo  compartments  (e.g., robot vans, Metro-type vehicles, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), EOD  Base  Support  Emergency  Response  Vehicle  (BSERV),  Mine  Resistant  Ambush Protected  (MRAP)  family  of  vehicles);  EOD  units  are  authorized  to  transport  minimum essential quantities of all HDs inside the vehicle.  Ensure explosives are secured to prevent movement during transit.  Separate incompatible explosives to the maximum extent possible. 8.22.4.  Basic load munitions issued to emergency response personnel in the performance of their duties are exempt from these  requirements.  Basic loads  can include HD 1.1 40 mm grenades,  Light  Anti-Armor  Weapon  (LAW)  rockets,  etc.    However,  comply  with  all requirements  of  this  paragraph  for  transportation  of  re-supply  stocks  ensuring  explosive resupply stocks are secured to prevent movement during transit. 8.22.5.  When  units  responsible  for  demolition  operations  are  issued  vehicles  without separate cargo compartments, such vehicles may be used to transport minimum quantities of explosives necessary to support demolition.  Use trailers to the maximum extent possible. 8.23.  Transporting  EIDs.  When  transporting  items  containing  EIDs,  fully  consider  EMR hazards (see AFI 91-208).  Vehicles with plastic bed liners may be used to transport EIDs that are in their original sealed outer package, box, or container.  Metal ammo-type containers may be used to transport EIDs in vehicles with plastic bed liners if the containers provide the protection required by paragraph 7.8.2. and are bonded to the metal body of the vehicle. 8.24.  Transporting  Aircraft  Seats  and  Survival  Kits.  Aircraft  seats  and  survival  kits  with explosive  devices  installed  must  contain  required  safety  pins  and  devices  and  be  secured  to prevent movement during transit. (T-1). 156 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 8.25.  Packaging.  Transport  explosives  in  their  approved  storage  and  shipping  packaging.    If less  than  a  single  shipping  package  is  transported,  pack  the  explosives  separately  from  other items in enclosed, clearly marked metal or wooden containers. 8.26.  Placarding. 8.26.1.  Use  DOT  placards  as  outlined  in  Subpart  F  of  49  CFR  Parts172.500  –  172.560.  When transporting munitions off the installation in a foreign country comply with host-nation requirements. (T-0). 8.26.2.  Commanders  may  omit  placards  on  base  where  necessary  to  avoid  attention  of hostile forces.  Instruct all personnel in proper emergency actions. 8.26.3.  Where tow vehicle and trailer combinations are used on base, placard the tow vehicle on the front and the last trailer on the rear.  Placard explosives loaded trailers in between on each side.  Placards may be omitted for transporting HD 1.4 material on base provided the responsible Commander approves in writing. 8.26.4.  Placard  materials  handling  equipment  only  when  used  in  the  same  manner  as  a transport vehicle or trailer. 8.26.5.  Compatibility group letters may be omitted from the placard if the vehicle remains on the installation. 8.26.6.  Placards are not required when transporting nuclear weapons or on any explosives loaded vehicle in a nuclear weapons storage area. 8.26.7.  Properly placard vehicles transporting Canine Explosive Scent kits. 8.27.  Motor  Vehicle  Inspection.  Prior  to  use,  inspect  motor  vehicles  used  to  transport explosives to determine that: 8.27.1.  Fire extinguishers are available, filled, and in good working order (see paragraph 10.23.). 8.27.2.  Electric wiring is in good condition and properly attached. 8.27.3.  Chassis, motor, pan, and underside of body is reasonably free of oil, grease, and fuel. 8.27.4.  Fuel tank and feed lines are secure and not leaking. 8.27.5.  Brakes, steering, lights, horn, and windshield wipers are functioning properly. 8.27.6.  Tires are properly inflated and serviceable IAW TO 36-1-191. 8.28.  Load Protection and Stability. 8.28.1.  Cover  exposed  ferrous  metal  in  the  cargo  compartment  before  transporting explosives that are not packaged in DOT specified containers or equivalent. (T-1). 8.28.2.  Use only static resistant and noncombustible or flameproof tops or coverings. 8.28.3.  Fasten safety chains between towing vehicles and trailers carrying explosives when lunette and pintle fastenings are used.  Safety chains are not required when using specifically designed breakaway control safety features prescribed by the pertinent TO. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 157 8.28.4.  Ensure  lifting  devices  on  vehicles  or  handling  equipment  have  a  serviceable mechanism designed to prevent sudden dropping of the load in the event of power failure. (T-1). 8.28.5.  Do not extend loads on the tines of a forklift more than one-third of the height of the top tier of containers above the backrest. (T-1). 8.28.6.  Ensure forklifts use skids or pallets to move containers of explosives, except when containers are designed with fully enclosed stirrups (360 degrees) for forklift tines. (T-1). 8.28.7.  Munitions may be carried on forklift tines when the weapon body is long enough to be firmly supported on both tines and strong enough to prevent damage. 8.28.8.  Ensure munitions loads (AE and inert AE components) on all types of vehicles and handling equipment are stable and secure before movement. (T-1).  Load stability is required for  all  movements,  to  include  rewarehousing  or  other  activities  conducted  between  one  or more storage magazines, storage pads or other operating location.  For on base movements, munitions  loads  (AE  and  inert  AE  components)  must  be  restrained,  blocked,  braced,  tied down  or  otherwise  secured  to  the  vehicle  to  prevent  movement  and  must  not  damage explosives  or  containers.  (T-1).    “Secure”  means  the  load  is  protected  by  an  effective restraining system.  Restraining devices may include chains and binders, cargo nets and tie-down straps, sideboards and tailgates, etc. 8.28.9.  Consider  vehicle  and  handling  equipment  type,  type  of  load,  and  the  prevailing weather and road conditions when determining if safe transport is feasible.  This guidance pertains to MSAs as well as applicable flightline operations. 8.29.  Loading and Unloading. 8.29.1.  Chock explosives loaded vehicles, MMHE (except MHU-196 and MHU-204 trailers) and MHE (trailers, UALS, etc.) during loading or unloading operations. (T-1). 8.29.2.  To the maximum extent possible, position munitions cargo vehicles to permit loading and unloading from each side of the cargo bed.  Access munitions from the side closest to the load unless access can only be obtained from one side. 8.29.3.  Except as required in the event of an electrical storm (see Section 7H), do not leave explosives-laden vehicles unattended unless they are parked in a properly  designated  area, such as the weapons storage area, holding yard or flightline munitions holding area. (T-1). 8.29.4.  Do not load or unload explosives from a motor vehicle while the engine is running (T-1), except under the following conditions: 8.29.4.1.  Where the engine is required to provide power to vehicle mechanical handling equipment used in loading and unloading the vehicle. 8.29.4.2.  Where necessary for emergency operations or timing for exercises simulating execution  of  emergency  plans.    In  this  case,  small  loads  or  packages  of  explosives delivered to aircraft, requiring only momentary unloading time, may be removed from a vehicle while the motor is running. 8.29.4.3.  Engines  of  diesel-powered  vehicles  may  continue  to  run  during  loading  or unloading  of  explosives  except  when  exposed  explosives  or  hazardous  locations  are involved. 158 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 8.29.4.4.  Adequate  ventilation  is  provided  to  prevent  unnecessary  build-up  of  exhaust gases. 8.29.5.  Do not leave vehicles at aircraft or storage locations longer than needed to complete explosives loading or unloading.  If a delay occurs, move the vehicle from location. 8.29.6.  Refuel trucks before loading explosives. 8.30.  Vehicle Refueling. 8.30.1.  Refuel  non-explosives  loaded  vehicles  and  equipment  at  least  100  feet  from structures or sites containing explosives. 8.30.2.  When refueling explosives-loaded vehicles, maintain a bonded path between the tank being  filled  and  the  tank  being  emptied  and    ground  the  entire  system.  (T-1).    Refer  to Section 7D for further guidance on static grounding. 8.30.2.1.  When refueling is completed, remove refueling vehicle from the storage area. 8.30.2.2.  Use the smallest available size of refueling unit. 8.30.2.3.  One person must be present during the entire operation. 8.30.2.4.  During  refueling,  stop  motors  of  vehicle  being  refueled  and  refueling  truck (unless refueling truck motor drives the pump). 8.30.2.5.  In event of a fuel spill, immediately notify the base fire department.  Do not start motors of refueling truck or unit being refueled until area is rendered safe. 8.31.  Battery-Powered MHE.  Battery-powered MHE is preferred for handling explosives and used when possible. 8.31.1.  Mount  electrical  cables  to  prevent  catching  on  stationary  objects  or  damage  by cutting or abrasion.  Protect cables to prevent short-circuiting as far as practicable. 8.31.2.

Processing Incoming Loaded Railcars. 8.50.1.  A competent representative will inspect railcars containing explosives at a designated inspection station.  Inspection stations do not require explosives siting if they are limited to the  activities  described  in  paragraph  12.57.    Apply  QD  criteria  per  Chapter  12  if  the inspection  station  is  also  used  as  explosives  storage  or  suspect  vehicle  holding  area.    The inspection station may be used as an interchange yard.  Remove railcars promptly. 8.50.2.  Inspect  the  outside  and  underside  of  each  car  to  detect  damage  (such  as  defective brakes, couplings, wheel flanges, or hot boxes) or unauthorized and suspicious articles. 8.50.3.  If  pits  are  not  available,  conduct  inspections  from  ground  level.    Provide  pits  if sabotage is possible. 8.50.4.  If rail traffic is heavy enough or in an emergency, a pit should help in inspecting and moving cars rapidly. 8.50.5.  Isolate cars of explosives for prompt corrective actions when foreign and suspicious articles have been attached outside or underneath the car.  Also isolate when there is a defect that could affect installation safety or car contents. 8.50.5.1.  Move  car,  unless  the  problem  prohibits,  over  the  safest  route  to  a  location separated from other areas by proper IBD. 8.50.5.2.  Correct the unsatisfactory conditions before the car and cargo are released from the designated suspect car site, unless a determination is made that they are safe to move. 8.50.6.  Check individual car numbers and seal numbers against bills of lading.  If the seal numbers on a car do not correspond to the numbers shown on the bill of lading, or a seal is not  in  place,  treat  as  a  suspect  car.    Remove  it  to  the  suspect  car  siting  for  additional inspection. 8.50.7.  Visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo in cars that pass the initial inspection may be done at any suitable place, including the unloading point.  Such cars may be considered reasonably safe.  However, exercise care in breaking seals and opening doors because of the potential for shifted loads or leaking containers. 8.50.8.  If  warranted  by  the  inspection  results,  promptly  remove  cars  from  the  inspection station. 164 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 8.50.9.  Externally  inspect  commercial  carriers  used  to  move  explosives  through  a  public access  route,  from  one  area  to  another  area  of  the  installation,  before  entering  the  second area.  This is not needed if it is escorted or under surveillance enroute. 8.51.  Rail  Interchange  Yards.  Use  this  location  for  the  exchange  of  railcars  between  the common  carrier  and  the  base  activity  involved.    Interchange  yards  do  not  require  explosives siting if they are limited to the activities described in paragraph 12.58.  Apply QD criteria per Chapter 12 if the interchange yard is also used as explosives storage or suspect vehicle holding area.  The interchange yard may be used as an inspection station.  Remove railcars promptly. 8.52.  Rail  Holding  Yards.  If  explosives-loaded  railcars  cannot  be  dispatched  to  unloading points promptly, move the railcars to a holding yard.  See paragraph 12.59. for holding yard siting requirements.  Holding yards may be used for interchange and inspection activities. 8.53.  Rail  Classification  Yards.  Where  the  volume  of  rail  traffic  necessitates,  establish  a classification  yard  primarily  for  receiving,  classifying,  switching,  and  dispatching  explosives-laden  railcars.    Classification  yards  do  not  require  explosives  siting  if  they  are  limited  to  the activities described in paragraph 12.60.  Apply QD criteria per Chapter 12 if the classification yard is also used as explosives storage or suspect vehicle holding area.  The classification yard may be used as an interchange yard.  Remove railcars promptly. 8.54.  Trailers on Flat Cars or Piggyback Explosives Loading and Unloading.  The following instructions govern use of explosives Trailers on Flat Cars (TOFC) railheads: 8.54.1.  Control loading or unloading operations to reduce exposures to a minimum. 8.54.2.  Quickly remove trailers from the railroad car and send at once to their destination or schedule for prompt loading on arrival at the site.  If there is an unforeseen delay in loading or unloading, an explosives-loaded trailer may be kept at the site for a period not exceeding one working day. 8.54.3.  Do  not  open  piggyback  shipping  trailers  and  containers  at  the  site  except  for emergency  or  suspected  emergency  situations,  except  as  for  Shipping  and  Storage Containers, Ballistic Missile (SSCBM).  SSCBM received by TOFC may be opened at the site for inspection and road transport preparation per pertinent TOs. 8.54.4.  Ensure  adequate  tie-down  of  trailers  to  railcars  and  blocking  and  bracing  of explosives in the trailer.  Cargo stability in transit is essential. 8.54.5.  Apply  safety  rules  in  this  Chapter  on  explosives-laden  motor  vehicles  and  their operation. 8.54.6.  The provisions of Bureau of Explosives Pamphlet 6C apply to explosives piggyback operations.  This pamphlet lists railcars and hitches approved for TOFC service. 8.54.7.  Except  for  those  just  discussed,  do  not  conduct  operations  on  explosive  items  or explosives-laden containers, trailers, cars, etc., unless applicable QD criteria are met.

Scope and Applicability. 10.1.1.  This section establishes standard firefighting hazard identification measures to ensure a minimum practicable risk in fighting fires involving AE.  These identification measures are based on the classification of AE fires into four fire divisions according to their predominant hazard. 10.1.2.  AE hazard symbols and supplemental symbols including chemical agent symbols are for firefighting situations (see paragraph 10.4.). 10.2.  Fire Divisions.  There are four fire divisions.  Fire division 1 indicates the greatest hazard.  The hazard decreases with ascending fire division numbers from one to four, and are related to HD as shown in Table 10.1.  The hazard is based on the burning or explosives characteristics of the material.  Fire symbols do not apply to liquid propellants, except for symbol 1, which is used to indicate a detonation hazard of Group IV propellant.  Fire protection for insensitive HE (both bulk and filled items) is based on their equivalent storage classification. 10.3.  Fire Division Symbols. 10.3.1.  The four fire divisions are represented by four distinctive symbols so that firefighting personnel can recognize the hazards.  A fire division number is shown on each symbol.  For the  purpose  of  identifying  these  symbols  from  long  range,  the  symbols  differ  in  shape  as shown in Figure 10.1. 10.3.2.  The shape and dimensions of the symbols are shown in Figure 10.1.  This shape and color scheme is consistent with the requirements of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),  United  Nations  Organization  (UNO),  and  International  Maritime  Organization (IMO). 10.4.  Chemical Agent and Chemical Munition Hazard Symbols. 10.4.1.  The storage of chemical agents and chemical munitions requires the use of chemical hazard symbols.  Use these symbols in conjunction with fire symbols; where appropriate (see Figures 10.2. and  10.3.).  Some of the common chemical agents used in AE, the CG of that AE, and the chemical hazard symbols required in storage are specified in Table 10.2. 10.4.2.  The following sections describe these symbols, the hazards indicated by the symbols, and  the  recommended  protective  clothing  and  equipment  to  be  used  for  fighting  fires involving these chemical agents and chemical munitions.  Where respiratory protection (self-contained  breathing  apparatus  (SCBA)  and  protective  masks)  are  used,  personnel  must implement  a  workplace  respiratory  protection  program  IAW  AFI  48-137,  Respiratory Protection  Program.  (T-1).   Reference  the  item  TO,  or  contact  Bioenvironmental Engineering for protective clothing requirements for situations other than firefighting.  The SCBA and other protective clothing and equipment prescribed in this paragraph must be used AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 169 if  required  for  use  by  other  applicable  technical  orders  or  other  DoD  or  Air  Force publications. (T-1).  See AFI 10-2501 for further guidance. 10.4.2.1.  Set  1  of  Chemical  Hazard  Symbol  1  requires  full  protective  clothing  and indicates the presence of highly toxic chemical  agents that may cause death or serious damage  to  body  functions  (see  Figure  10.2.  and  Table  10.2.).    Use  the  following  full protective  clothing  (Level  An  encapsulating  suit  IAW  TO  14P3-1-7,  Toxicological Protective Apron, M-2): 10.4.2.1.1.  Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). 10.4.2.1.2.  Impermeable  suit,  hood,  boots,  undergarments,  coveralls,  protective footwear, and gloves. 10.4.2.2.  Set  2  of  Chemical  Hazard  Symbol  1  requires  full  protective  clothing  and indicates the presence of harassing agents (riot control agents and smokes) (see Figure 10.2. and Table 10.2.).  Use the following protective clothing: 10.4.2.2.1.  Protective gas masks or SCBA. 10.4.2.2.2.  Permeable coveralls. 10.4.2.2.3.  Protective gloves. 10.4.2.2.4.  Firefighting personnel equipped with normal heat-resistant clothing (e.g., firefighter  protective  ensemble)  and  gas  mask  or  SCBA  do  not  require  the  set  2 protective clothing. 10.4.2.3.  Set  3  of  Chemical  Hazard  Symbol  1  requires  full  protective  clothing  and indicates  the  presence  of  WP  or  other  spontaneously  combustible  material.    Use  the following protective clothing: 10.4.2.3.1.  Protective gas masks or SCBA. 10.4.2.3.2.  Flameresistant coveralls and gloves. 10.4.2.3.3.  Firefighting personnel equipped with normal heat-resistant clothing (e.g., bunker suit) and gas mask or SCBA do not require the set 3 protective clothing (see Figure 10.2. and Table 10.2.). 10.4.2.4.  Chemical  Hazard  Symbol  2  requires  the  wearing  of  breathing  apparatus  and indicates the presence of incendiary or readily flammable chemical agents that present an intense radiant heat hazard (see Figure 10.2. and Table 10.2.).  Use protective masks to prevent inhalation of smoke from burning incendiary mixtures. 10.4.2.5.  Chemical  Hazard  Symbol  3  warns  against  applying  water  and  indicates  a dangerous reaction will occur if water is used in an attempt to extinguish fire (see Figure 10.2. and Table 10.2.). 10.5.  Obtaining  Firefighting  Symbol  Decals.  Decals  for  fire  and  chemical  hazard  symbols may be obtained through normal Air Force supply channels.  National stock numbers (NSN) of standard and half-size decals are listed in Figures 10.1.,  10.2., and  10.3.  Make backing for fire symbol decals the shape of the decal and out of non-combustible material.  If heat from the fire burns  off  the  numbers,  the  fire  department  can  act  on  the  shape.    AFVA  91-216,  USAF Explosives Fire and Chemical Hazard Symbols, is available through publication channels. 170 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Section 10B—Posting Firefighting Symbols 10.6.  Purpose  of  Posting  Firefighting  Symbols.  Firefighting symbols are used as a back-up precaution  for  alerting  response  personnel  to  explosives  or  chemicals  present.    Firefighting symbols  posted  on  nuclear,  chemical,  or  conventional  weapon  storage  sites  will  comply  with paragraph 10.7. unless otherwise directed by the Base Fire Chief (direction must be in writing). (T-1).   These  written  directions  notify  personnel  that  local  conditions  (i.e.,  security considerations)  may  make  it  undesirable  to  identify  munitions  with  fire  symbols  at  the  actual storage locations. 10.7.  Posting Requirements for Firefighting Symbols. 10.7.1.  Post the fire symbol and chemical symbol that applies to the most hazardous material present at nonnuclear explosives locations. (T-1). 10.7.2.  When  non-Class  1  hazardous  items  or  materials  are  stored  or  used  in  a  facility, without other items of class 1, identify the predominant hazard to guide emergency response personnel.  In this case, placards are required IAW NFPA and Occupatinal Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA)  regulations.  (T-0).    Do  not  display  NFPA  and  OSHA  placards concurrently with Class 1 fire symbols. 10.7.3.  Post  firefighting  symbols  when  AE  or  chemical  agents  are  placed  in  a  facility  or location, and remove the symbols when the AE or chemical agents are removed. (T-1).  The person in charge of the operation is responsible for posting or changing the symbols. 10.7.4.  Notify the Emergency Communication Center (ECC) each time firefighting symbols are changed. (T-1). 10.7.5.  Half-sized symbols may be used on doors or lockers inside buildings.  Additionally, half-size symbols may also be used for individual bays on structures where full size symbols prohibit the proper functioning of the doors.  Post full size symbols for the highest hazard and applicable sets to be visible from all approach roads. (T-1). 10.7.6.  Licensed Explosives Storage Locations. 10.7.6.1.  Post  symbols  on  exterior  and  interior  entrances  to  small  rooms  licensed  for storing AE. (T-1). 10.7.6.2.  Post symbols on lockers or containers licensed for storing AE. (T-1). 10.7.6.3.  Posting  symbols  on  the  exterior  of  buildings  containing  licensed  storage locations are optional, provided the Base Fire Chief approves in writing.  When posted, ensure symbols are visible from all approach roads. 10.7.7.  Non-Flightline Sited Explosives Locations. 10.7.7.1.  Ensure symbols are visible from all approach roads. 10.7.7.2.  When one symbol applies to all AE within a storage area or on a service road, it may be posted at the entry control point or row entrance. 10.7.7.3.  Post individual symbols on each door of a multicuble storage magazine.. (T-1).  Post the symbol for the highest hazard and applicable sets to be visible from all approach roads. (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 171 10.7.8.  Flightline Sited Explosives Locations. 10.7.8.1.  Identify aircraft loaded with nonnuclear weapons with symbols posted at each aircraft or aircraft shelter. 10.7.8.2.  One  fire  symbol  may  be  posted  at  the  entry  point  (point  of  entry  for  fire-fighting personnel) to an aircraft area. 10.7.8.3.  Notify the ECC when each aircraft is loaded or unloaded. (T-1).  Give aircraft parking location and type of explosives involved. 10.7.8.4.  During  mass  loading  of  three  or  more  aircraft,  when  a  fire  truck  is  present, notify the ECC as soon as the last loading is complete. 10.8.  Exceptions to Posting Firefighting Symbols. 10.8.1.  Locations  with  aircraft  having  only  exempted  devices  according  to  paragraph 12.47.  This exception does not apply to explosives cargo. 10.8.2.  Missile sites with a single type of weapon system, such as ICBM sites. 10.8.3.  Locations with 1,000 rounds or less of HD 1.4 small arms ammunition. 10.8.4.  When, by agreement, host-nation symbols are used. 10.8.5.  When the responsible Commander temporarily orders them removed for emergency security purposes. 10.8.6.  Locations  storing  or  maintaining  nuclear  weapons  or  both  nuclear  and  nonnuclear weapons.  Maintain a map or listing of munitions locations.  Use line numbers or symbols from  TO  11N-20-11,  General  Firefighting  Guidance,  for  nuclear  weapons.    Provide  this information to the Fire Department.  Update as changes occur. 10.8.7.  Aircraft  loaded  with  nuclear  weapons  or  with  nonnuclear  and  nuclear  weapons within the same designated area. 10.8.8.  Aircraft in a designated explosives parking area if described in a local publication.  Include the class/division, governing symbol, emergency procedures and the requirement to notify the Fire Department. 10.8.9.  Locations storing only assembled aircrew flight equipment (e.g., parachutes, aircrew flight equipment kits, life rafts, life preservers, etc.) containing authorized explosives, when approved by the Base Fire Chief or authority having jurisdiction. Section 10C—Firefighting Measures and Withdrawal Distances 10.9.  Firefighting Measures. 10.9.1.  Fires  involving  conventional  munitions  cannot  be  definitive  to  any  one  set  of circumstances  and  environmental  conditions.    This  precludes  development  of  reliable standardized  test  criteria  and  reliable  specific  item  firefighting  and  withdrawal  times.  The conclusion to be reached from available data is that a munitions reaction to fire is a function of  case  thickness  and  type  of  explosive  filler  which  can  be  varied  by  environmental conditions.  Since  the  circumstances  of  a  fire  cannot  be  predicted,  specific  item  by  item firefighting and withdrawal times cannot be determined with any degree of reliability. 172 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 10.9.2.  Firefighters must have a thorough knowledge of the hazards associated with AE fires and expected AE reactions. (T-1).  The firefighting forces and other essential personnel will be  briefed  before  approaching  the  scene  of  the  fire.  (T-1).    They  will  be  informed  of  the known  hazards  and  conditions  existing  at  the  fire  scene  prior  to  proceeding  to  the  fire location. (T-1). 10.9.3.  Fires involving AE will be fought according to the HD, fire division, the progression of the fire, and the procedures specified in this Manual. (T-1). 10.9.4.  Report  all  fires  starting  in  the  vicinity  of  ammunition  or  explosives  and  fight immediately  with  all  available  means  to  prevent  the  spreading  of  fire  and  munitions involvement. (T-1).  However, if fire engulfs explosives material or is supplying heat to it, or if the fire is so large that it cannot be extinguished with the equipment on hand, evacuate personnel involved and seek safety. (T-1).  See Table 10.1. for additional information and when required, evacuate personnel per paragraph 10.10. 10.10.  Fire  Withdrawal  Distances.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  developing  evacuation plans  that  include  the  applicable  withdrawal  distances  as  part  of  the  installation’s  emergency planning (see paragraph 10.13.). (T-1).  10.10.1.  Non-essential  personnel. emergency situations only and are not to be used for facility explosives siting.   These  emergency  withdrawal  distances  apply  in 10.10.1.1.  The  initial  withdrawal  distance  for  non-essential  personnel  will  be  at  least IBD for the PES involved.  If the fire involves AE, AE involvement is imminent, or the fire  is  or  may  become  uncontrollable,  then  use  the  fire  withdrawal  distances  listed  in Table 10.3.  The fire withdrawal distances depend on fire involvement and on whether or not the HD and quantity of explosives are known. 10.10.1.2.  Structures  or  protected  locations  offering  equivalent  protection  for  the distances in Table 10.3 may be used in lieu of relocating personnel from the structure or location  to  the  specified  fire  withdrawal  distance.    See  Section  6B  for  additional information. 10.10.2.  Essential personnel.  Emergency authorities on-site will determine who qualify as, and the withdrawal distance for, essential personnel at accidents. (T-1). 10.10.3.  Chemical  Agents.    AE  containing  both  explosives  and  chemical  agents  requires special attention and precautions in firefighting (see Table 10.2.).  Fires involving such AE will be fought IAW their fire division characteristics.  Responding personnel must consider the additional hazards and precautions for the chemical agents involved. (T-1). 10.10.4.  Underground  Explosives  Facilities.    Entry  to  underground  explosives  facilities following a fire or explosion requires special precautions.  Emergency personnel will monitor for the presence of toxic fumes or oxygen depleted atmospheres, and will evaluate structural damage during initial entry following an accident. (T-1).  Commanders will develop written procedures that define actions in such emergency situations (see paragraph 10.13.). (T-1). 10.10.5.  Nuclear  Weapons.    Nuclear  weapons  fire  withdrawal  distances  are  listed  in  TO 11N-20-11, General Fire Fighting Guidance. 10.11.  Improvised  Explosive  Device  (IED)  Withdrawal  Distances.  Withdraw  all  non-essential personnel IAW AFMAN 10-2502, Air Force Incident Management System (AFIMS),  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 173 Standards  and  Procedures.  (T-1).    When  determining  more  specific  distances  based  upon suspicious/suspect  devices  use  the  Air  Force  “Recommended  Improvised  Explosive  Device (IED) Minimum Evacuation Distance (MED)” chart provided in AFMAN 10-2503, Operations in  a  Chemical,  Biological,  Radiological,  Nuclear,  and  High-Yield  Explosive  (CBRNE) Environment. Note:  The use of any secondary agency MED chart for explosive devices is prohibited due to the inconsistency of the mathematical methods used to determine their evacuation distances, which in most cases, recommend much smaller safety footprints. 10.12.  Withdrawal Distances for AE Not Involved in Fire (e.g., Dropped Munitions).  Base the  initial  decision  to  evacuate  non-essential  personnel  on  the  type  of  AE  involved  and  its susceptibility  to  become  more  unstable,  armed,  or  hazardous.    Exercise  good  judgment,  with regards  to  protecting  personnel  from  the  hazards  of  the  AE  or  surrounding  area.    When evacuation is considered necessary, or is required by other technical guidance, clear the area to a distance of 300 feet (125 feet for simulators and smoke producing devices). (T-1).  The incident Commander, with recommendation from EOD, may adjust withdrawal distances. Section 10D—Emergency Planning 10.13.  Emergency  Planning.  Commanders  will  develop  an  emergency  management  plan designed to provide safety, security, and environmental protection for accidents involving AE. Coordinate  plans  with  the  applicable  federal,  state,  and  local  emergency  response  authorities (e.g., law enforcement, fire departments, hospitals, etc.) and any established Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC). (T-1).  10.13.1.  In  addition  to  requirements  prescribed  in  AFI  10-2501,  the  plan  will  include  the following: (T-1). 10.13.1.1.  Specific sections and guidance that address withdrawal distances, emergency preparedness,  contingency  planning,  and  security.  The  developed  EM  plan  will  limit access to accident sites to trained and authorized personnel. 10.13.1.2.  Procedures  that  minimize  the  possibility  of  an  unpermitted  or  uncontrolled detonation,  release,  discharge,  or  migration  of  AE  out  of  any  storage  unit  when  such release, discharge or migration may endanger human health or the environment. 10.13.1.3.  Provisions  for  prompt  notification  (to  include  withdrawal  distances)  to emergency response and environmental agencies and the potentially affected public for an actual or potential detonation or uncontrolled release, discharge, or migration of AE that may endanger human health or the environment. 10.13.1.4.  Provisions  for  complying  with  the  Emergency  Planning  Community  Right-To-Know Act (EPCRA) and Air Force implementing policies. 10.13.2.  Each  unit  and  installation  fire  protection  agency  with  AE  storage  and  operations must  develop  pre-fire  plans  as  prescribed  by  AFI  32-2001,  Fire  Emergency  Services Program.  (T-1).  Include  all  AE  locations  and  operations,  to  include  licensed  explosives storage locations. 10.13.3.  Each ECC will have  an area map or computer-generated display  showing all AE locations and operations and their firefighting symbols, to include licensed explosives storage 174 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 locations. (T-1).  This map must also show adjacent facilities at risk from explosives. (T-1). Whenever possible, ensure all sites have a CE real property identification number. 10.14.  Fire  Drills.  Drills are conducted to train firefighting forces and unit personnel, and to ensure all other personnel involved understand their duties.  They are also conducted to evaluate fire alarm systems, firefighting equipment, and evacuation procedures. 10.14.1.  Perform fire drills within the MSA at intervals not to exceed six months. 10.14.2.  Coordinate  fire  drills  with  the  Base  Fire  Chief  if  a  Fire  Department  response  is involved. (T-1).  This does not preclude unannounced drills of a Fire Department's response capabilities,  provided  coordination  with  the  Base  Fire  Chief  is  accomplished  at  least  30 minutes before starting the drill. 10.14.3.  Personnel responsible for conducting drills will ensure all involved are aware that the drill is an exercise, and not an actual fire. (T-1). Section 10E—Fire Prevention 10.15.  Heat-Producing Devices.  In any explosives area, use devices that produce temperatures higher than 228o F (109o C) temporarily and only when essential. (T-1).  Develop written safety procedures for these devices and include details on the location, purpose, and duration of use.  (T-1).    Coordinate  the  procedures  through  the  base  safety  office  and  the  Fire  Department  for approval. (T-1).  Properly installed, approved furnaces and electrical space heaters are exempt.  Heat-producing devices are not allowed where exposed explosives are present.  Ensure personnel are qualified on the equipment prior to use. 10.16.  Vegetation  Control.  The  primary  purpose  of  vegetation  control  is  to  limit  the probability of combustible vegetation catching fire and to slow the spread of vegetation fires. 10.16.1.  Except  for  firebreaks,  maintain  grounds  in  or  near  explosives  storage  areas  or operating locations according to AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources. (T-1).  Limit maintenance on these grounds to that which is necessary to prevent erosion or other waste of natural resources. 10.16.2.  Balance  the  level  of  vegetation  control  with  operational  factors,  such  as  cost  to control,  security,  erosion  prevention,  BASH  program  requirements,  and  passive  defense (camouflage). 10.16.3.  Use varieties of vegetation that are resistant to burning where feasible. 10.16.4.  Do not use herbicides or soil sterilants if complete removal of vegetation causes soil erosion. 10.16.5.  Do not allow dead or cut vegetation to accumulate. 10.16.6.  When animals are used for vegetation control on barricade surfaces and igloo earth cover, avoid overgrazing to prevent erosion. 10.17.  Firebreaks.  Where  environmental  and  security  factors  allow,  maintain  50-foot firebreaks around each PES except for ECMs.  Maintain five feet around ECM ventilators. (T-1). 10.18.  Controlled  Burning.  The  installation  Wildland  Program  Manager  approves  and provides oversight for controlled burning of vegetation. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 175 10.18.1.  Do not conduct controlled burning within 200 feet of any explosives location. (T-1). 10.18.2.  Close windows, doors and ventilators of facilities containing explosives within 600 feet of burning operations. (T-1). 10.18.3.  Accomplish all controlled burns according to approved, site specific burn plans. (T-1). See AFI 32-7064, Integrated Natural Resources Management for additional information. 10.18.4.  The installation Wildland Program Manager determines firefighting personnel and equipment to be present during burning operations. 10.19.  Flammable  Liquids  for  Cleaning.  (T-1).    Do not use flammable liquids for cleaning purposes within an explosives area or near explosives, except as authorized by TO.  Confine use to  specific  designated  work  areas.    In-use  stocks  may  not  exceed  a  one-day  supply.    Store  in approved safety containers or dispensers. 10.20.  Paint  and  Other  Flammable  Materials.  The  following  guidance  applies  when  using paint and other flammable materials in AE locations. 10.20.1.  Comply with AFI 91-203. (T-1).  Store flammable materials in approved flammable storage cabinets, as required. 10.20.2.  Small  quantities  of  flammable  materials,  such  as  paints,  lubricants  and  solvents, required to support explosives maintenance operations may be stored in explosives operating locations as required.  This storage must not be the primary purpose of the area.  Incidental storage  of  flammable  materials  not  supporting  explosives  maintenance  operations  may  be authorized within 50 feet of explosives operating locations.  Consult fire department officials prior to establishing flammable storage areas in or near explosives operating locations. 10.20.3.  Do not store materials that add fuel sources (such as wood, paper, and rags) with flammable materials. 10.20.4.  Open containers of flammable materials only when in use. 10.20.5.  For outdoor storage, place flammable materials in weatherproof containers. 10.20.6.  Locate  flammable  storage  locations  at  least  50  feet  from  explosives  locations  or isolate  flammable  storage  by  standard  fire  walls  approved  for  the  type  and  quantity  of flammables being stored. (T-1). 10.20.7.  Make available at least one fire extinguisher with a rating suitable for the type of material  involved.  (T-1).    Determine  fire  extinguisher  location  by  the  Fire  Emergency Services (FES) or civilian-equivalent fire unit, as appropriate per AFI 91-203, Chapter 6. 10.21.  Operating  Support  Equipment.  The  following  guidance  applies  when  operating support  equipment  (not  including  vehicles  powered  by  internal  combustion  engines  in  AE locations). 10.21.1.  Separation Distances. 10.21.1.1.  Locate equipment at least 25 feet from AE. (T-1).  Equipment may be closer provided adequate ventilation and a fire-resistant dividing wall are provided. 176 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 10.21.1.2.  Place aircraft ground support equipment as far away from AE as the length of the  power  cord,  the  length  of  the  hose  or  other  equipment  limitation  will  allow  or  as directed by applicable TO. 10.21.2.  Equipment designed into and installed as part of an operating or storage facility is exempt from paragraph 10.21.1. 10.21.3.  Operations in HASs are exempt from paragraph 10.21.1. 10.21.4.  Do not refuel equipment within 100 feet of AE. (T-1). 10.22.  Stacking Combustible Material.  (T-1).  The following guidance applies when stacking combustible material in AE locations. 10.22.1.  Stack containers, dunnage, lumber and so forth in an orderly manner. 10.22.2.  Keep stacks stable and separated as far as practical from operations. 10.22.3.  Limit stacks to 9,000 cubic feet. 10.22.4.  Do  not  place  bulk  stacks  of  combustible  materials  closer  than  100  feet  from  AE locations. 10.22.5.  If  necessary,  stack  working  quantities  in  the  vicinity  of  AE.    Remove  all  of  the material  upon  completion  of  the  operation  or  at  intervals  that  prevent  hazardous accumulation. 10.22.6.  Provide suitable fire protection equipment. 10.22.7.  When needed to prepare for combat operations, temporarily stack in or near the AE storage site those empty containers, dunnage, and lumber that cannot be removed while the work is in progress. 10.23.  Fire  Extinguishers.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the  Base  Fire  Chief,  provide  a minimum  of  two  fully  charged  fire  extinguishers,  suitable  for  the  hazards  involved,  for immediate use at any location where AE is being handled (T-1), except as noted. 10.23.1.  See paragraph 11.7.8. for licensed explosives storage locations. 10.23.2.  Provide each explosives-laden vehicle used for transport with at least two portable 2A:10BC  rated  extinguishers.  (T-1).    Mount  fire  extinguishers  IAW  AFI  24-301,  Vehicle Operations.  (T-1).    If  explosives-laden  vehicles  are  parked  at  a  location  designated  for explosive  operations,  additional  fire  extinguishers  beyond  those  required  in  paragraph 10.23. are not required.  If the vehicle leaves the explosives location, additional extinguishers are required.  Refer to AFI 24-301 and AFMAN 24-306 IP, Manual for the Wheeled Vehicle Operator, for further guidance. 10.23.3.  Ensure  at  least  one  fire  extinguisher  is  available  for  each  item  of  powered  MHE used to handle AE. 10.23.3.1.  Individual  fire  extinguishers  are  not  required  for  each  piece  of  handling equipment during explosive operations if the requirements of paragraph 10.23. are met. 10.23.3.2.  If handling equipment is used to transport AE to a location where a second fire extinguisher is not immediately available, two portable 2A:10BC rated extinguishers are required for the handling equipment. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 177 10.23.4.

The term “Quantity-Distance” (QD) refers to protection requirements from potential explosion sites (PES) to different kinds of exposed sites (ES).  The QD standards were developed  over  many  years  and  are  based  on  explosives  mishaps,  tests  and  analyses.    QD separations are based on an acceptable level of damage between a PES and an ES. 12.1.1.  The  damage  or  injury  potential  of  explosions  is  normally  determined  by  the separation  distance  between  the  PES  and  ES;  the  ability  of  the  PES  to  suppress  blast overpressure, primary and secondary fragments; and the ability of the ES to resist explosion effects.  This Chapter: 12.1.1.1.  Defines permissible exposures for both accidental and intentional detonations. 12.1.1.2.  Sets  minimum  standards  for  separation  distances  between  PES  and  ES  by taking into account anticipated explosion effects, suppression, and resistance. 12.1.1.3.  Establishes explosives safety siting criteria (QD relationships) for PES and ES, based on blast, fragment, firebrand, thermal, and ground shock effects.  QD is determined by the effect requiring the greatest distance. 12.1.2.  When an appropriate degree of protection can be provided either by hardening an ES or  construction  of  a  PES  to  suppress  explosion  effects,  these  factors  may  be  taken  into account  and  the  distance  required  by  the  standard  QD  tables  may  be  reduced.    Submit construction designs with rationale or test results with the ESP. (T-1).  See Chapter 6. 12.1.3.  QD separation does not apply to AE in the transportation mode (see Chapter 8). Section 12B—Quantity-Distance (QD) Principles 12.2.  General.  The bases for determining required separation distances (QD) are: 12.2.1.  The construction and type of PES. 12.2.2.  The HD types and NEWQD of AE present in the PES. 12.2.3.  The construction and type of ES. 12.2.4.  The distance separating the PES from the ES. 12.2.5.  In some instances, the orientation of the PES and the ES. 12.3.  Types of Separations. 12.3.1.  Inhabited Building Distance (IBD).  This is the minimum distance required to protect facilities  and  personnel  not  directly  related  to  explosives  storage  and  operations.    At  IBD some damage and personnel injury may still be expected (see Chapter 2 for reaction effects). 12.3.2.  Public Traffic Route Distance (PTRD).   This is the minimum distance  required to protect  public  traffic  routes  (PTR)  (see  paragraph  12.16.3.  for  on-base  roads)  and  other 196 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 designated exposures.  At PTRD damage and personnel injury is expected (see Chapter 2 for reaction effects).  For HD 1.1 and 1.2, PTRD is normally 60 percent of IBD.  For HD 1.3 and 1.4, PTRD is the same as IBD.  PTR are classified as high, medium, and low traffic density.  Average  the  traffic  density  over  a  normal  (non-holiday)  week  in  terms  of  number  of passengers during a 24-hour period. Note:  In applying criteria other than the default values given below (based on a car (and rail) speed of 50 mph and a ship speed of 10 mph), take into account, the following considerations to establish exposure levels:  speed of vehicles, number of passengers per vehicle, protection afforded by the vehicle, variation in daily traffic levels in relation to AE activities, and seasonal traffic trends.  Use the default value of two passengers per car to estimate traffic density. 12.3.2.1.  High Traffic Density.  Routes having 10,000 or more car or rail passengers per day, or 2,000 or more ship passengers per day.  IBD separation is required for high traffic density routes per paragraph 12.15.1.19. 12.3.2.2.  Medium Traffic Density.  Routes having at least 400 but less than 10,000 car or rail passengers per day, or at least 80 but less than 2,000 ship passengers per day.  As a minimum, medium traffic density route criteria apply to any recreational activity that is extensive and occurs on a regular basis.  PTRD separation is required for medium traffic density routes per paragraph 12.16.1. 12.3.2.3.  Low Traffic Density.  Routes having fewer than 400 car or rail passengers per day, or fewer than 80 ship passengers per day.  PTRD separation (based on blast criteria only) is required for low traffic density routes per paragraph 12.16.2. 12.3.3.  Intraline Distance (ILD).  This is the minimum distance required to protect activities associated with explosives storage and operations.  Applying ILD recognizes the operational need for some people to be in the proximity of explosives while at the same time preserving some mission capability in the event of an explosives accident.  Unhardened facilities at this distance will be extensively damaged and occupants may be severely injured (see Chapter 2 for reaction effects).  In addition to the minimal protection to related activities, ILD should prevent  propagation  between  two  explosives  locations.    At  ILD,  no  propagation  from  the blast  overpressure  is  expected,  and  the  probability  of  propagation  from  low  angle,  high velocity fragments is significantly reduced.  For HD 1.1 and 1.2, ILD is normally 36 percent of IBD. 12.3.4.  Intermagazine  Distance  (IMD).    This  is  the  minimum  distance  between  PESs  to prevent one PES from simultaneously detonating an adjacent PES.  Maintaining IMD is no guarantee that propagation from one PES to another will not occur, only that they will not simultaneously  detonate.    At  this  distance,  severe  structural  damage  approaching  total destruction is expected for conventional structures, and severe personnel injury or death is expected  (see  Chapter  2  for  reaction  effects).    Earth  Covered  Magazines  (ECM)  provide significant  protection  at  IMD;  maintaining  IMD  between  ECMs  will  provide  virtually complete protection of AE against the propagation effects of an explosion.  However, AE in adjacent ECMs may be damaged (see paragraph 2.1.5.3.).  When less than required IMD exists between any two or more PESs, add the quantities of explosives in these locations to form a single PES encompassing the area and NEWQDs of the PESs not meeting IMD.  For this reason, do not waive any separation between explosives locations less than IMD. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 197 Section 12C—Determining Net Explosive Weight for Quantity-Distance (NEWQD) 12.4.  Determining  NEWQD  of  AE  Items.  See paragraph 3.6. for guidance on determining the  NEWQD  of  AE  items.    The  explosive  weight  of  Not-Regulated  AE  and  AE  assigned  to Classes 2 through 9 is not considered for QD purposes (see paragraph 3.5.). 12.5.  Determining NEWQD of a PES.  Generally, the combined NEWQD of all AE in a PES is  used  as  the  NEWQD  of  the  PES  for  explosives  siting.    Determine  NEWQD  of  a  PES  as follows: 12.5.1.  If only one HD is present, combine the NEWQD of each AE item involved. 12.5.2.  If multiple HDs are authorized, but only one HD is present at a time, determine the NEWQD separately for each HD (as described in paragraph 12.5.1.). 12.5.3.  If  more  than  one  HD  is  present  at  the  same  time,  determine  the  NEWQD  per paragraph 12.7. 12.5.4.  See Section 12N for determining NEWQD for energetic liquids. 12.5.5.  Where  explosives  are  located  in  a  common  facility  or  location  and  are  further subdivided into cells or stacks by IMD or equivalent protection (such as for buffered storage or  multicubicals),  the  cell  or  stack  with  the  greatest  NEWQD  may  be  used  for  explosives siting if specifically allowed by this Manual or approved by AFSEC/SEW.  Where IMD or equivalent protection is not provided, use the total NEWQD of all explosives. 12.5.6.  For  HD  1.2.1,  use  the  MCE  as  outlined  in  paragraph  3.16.4.  as  the  basis  for determining applicable QD. 12.5.7.  For  HD  1.2.3,  use  the  LSRN  as  outlined  in  paragraph  14.23.6.  as  the  basis  for determining applicable QD. 12.5.8.  Base the NEWQD of a host-nation PES that may be hazarding Air Force facilities and personnel on the maximum NEWQD the host-nation indicates will ever be present at that PES location.  If the NEWQD cannot be obtained from the host-nation, the responsible safety staff must estimate the type and quantity of explosives.  Base estimates on knowledge of the host-nation's military mission and type of facility involved (such as ECM, aircraft shelter, or maintenance facility).  As a general rule, use the maximum NEWQD that would be allowed in a similar Air Force facility per paragraph 12.6. 12.5.9.  When an AE conveyance (e.g., railroad car or motor vehicle), containing AE is not separated  from  a  PES  in  such  a  manner  as  to  prevent  mass  detonation,  then  consider  the conveyance and PES as a unit and add their NEWQDs.  This does not apply to temporary staging for the purpose of loading/unloading. 12.5.10.  The NEWQD of the HD requiring the greatest separation establishes the QD for the facility when it is used for multiple operations. 12.6.  Maximum  NEWQD.  Regardless  of  actual  separations,  maximum  NEWQD  limitations for HD 1.1 and 1.2 are as follows: 12.6.1.  ECMs (except as noted in paragraph 12.6.2.) and AGMs:  500,000 lbs. 12.6.2.  7-Bar Navy Box Type:  500,000 lbs except as noted in DDESB TP 15. 198 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.6.3.  Barricaded modules at K1.1:  250,000 lbs. 12.6.4.  Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS):  See paragraph 12.50.5. 12.6.5.  Some facilities may have additional limits in order to use reduced QD criteria. 12.6.6.  Maximum NEWQD limits do not apply to ships, piers and wharfs. 12.7.  Determining NEWQD for Mixed HD. 12.7.1.  General. 12.7.1.1.  The presence of HD 1.4 does not affect the NEWQD of mixed HD.  However, for QD determinations, consider HD 1.4 criteria. 12.7.1.2.  When HD 1.1 is mixed with any other HD, treat the mixture as HD 1.1 except as noted in paragraph 12.7.2. 12.7.1.3.  HD 1.5 is always treated as HD 1.1. 12.7.1.4.  When  dissimilar  HD  1.6  are  mixed  and  have  not  been  tested  to  ensure  non-propagation,  then  individually  consider  the  mixed  HD  1.6  AE  to  be  HD  1.2.1  or  HD 1.2.2, based on their individual NEWQD or over-riding fragmentation characteristics. 12.7.2.  HD 1.1 with HD 1.2.  From the following, use whatever generates the largest QD: 12.7.2.1.  Sum the NEWQD for HD 1.1 and NEWQD for HD 1.2 and treat mixture as HD 1.1. 12.7.2.2.  The  NEWQD  of  the  mixture  is  the  NEWQD  of  the  HD  1.2  sub-division requiring the largest QD. 12.7.3.  HD 1.1 with HD 1.3.  Sum the NEWQD for HD 1.1 and the NEWQD for HD 1.3 and treat  the  mixture  as  HD  1.1.    AFSEC/SEW  may  grant  exceptions  to  this  guidance  when analyses or test results demonstrate that the HD 1.1 (for liquid propellants) will not cause detonation of the HD 1.3. 12.7.4.  HD 1.1 with HD 1.6.  Sum the NEWQD for HD 1.1 and the NEWQD for HD 1.6 and treat the mixture as HD 1.1. 12.7.5.  HD 1.2.1 with HD 1.2.2.  The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the sub-division requiring the largest QD. 12.7.6.  HD 1.2.1 with HD 1.2.3.  The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the sub-division requiring the largest QD. 12.7.7.  HD 1.2.2 with HD 1.2.3.  The NEWQD for the mixture is the NEWQD of the sub-division requiring the largest QD. 12.7.8.  HD  1.2.1  with  HD  1.2.2  with  HD  1.2.3.    The  NEWQD  for  the  mixture  is  the NEWQD of the sub-division requiring the largest QD. 12.7.9.  HD  1.2  with  HD  1.3.    The  NEWQD  for  the  mixture  is  the  NEWQD  of  the  HD requiring the largest QD. 12.7.10.  HD 1.2 with HD 1.6.  Treat the HD 1.6 as HD 1.2.3 and determine NEWQD IAW paragraphs 12.7.6. to  12.7.8., mixing rules for 1.2.3, as applicable. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 199 12.7.11.  HD 1.3 with HD 1.6.  Sum the NEWQD for the HD 1.6 and the NEWQD for the HD 1.3 and treat the mixture as HD 1.3. Section 12D—Determining Distances Between PESs and ESs 12.8.  General.  Separation  distances  are  measured  along  straight  lines.    For  large  intervening topographical features such as hills, measure over or around the feature, whichever distance is shorter. 12.9.  Measuring from a PES.  Measure from a PES, to an ES, as follows: 12.9.1.  The outside of the nearest exterior wall of the PES. 12.9.2.  The outside of the nearest wall of the structure or room, within the PES, containing explosives. 12.9.3.  The outside of the nearest wall of the compartment containing the greatest quantity distance hazard, when the PES is subdivided so that mass detonation between compartments will not occur. 12.9.4.  The stack face of an open storage PES, such as modules and revetments. 12.9.5.  The explosives carried externally on an aircraft parked either in the open or inside an approved lightweight shelter. 12.9.6.  The explosives on an AE conveyance (e.g., railroad car or motor vehicle) located in the open, and separated from other PESs in such a manner as to prevent mass detonation. 12.9.7.  The nearest edge of an AE conveyance (e.g., railroad car or motor vehicle) located in the open, and not separated from other PESs in such a manner as to prevent mass detonation. 12.9.8.  The nearest external wall of the shelter or stall containing explosives or explosives-loaded aircraft, in a HAS. 12.9.9.  The  center  of  large  missile  silos  and  the  outer  edge  of  launchers  or  launch  pad structures. 12.9.10.  The edge of a facility pad if used to hold munitions. 12.9.11.  The nearest edge of the aircraft cargo hold for internally loaded explosives. 12.10.  Measuring to an ES.  Measure to an ES, from a PES, as follows: 12.10.1.  The nearest edge of a non-explosives location, building, or taxiway. 12.10.2.  The outside of the nearest wall of the structure or room containing people, for an occupied ES. 12.10.3.  The stack face of an open storage PES, acting as an ES. 12.10.4.  The outside of the nearest wall of the structure or room containing explosives, for an ES requiring IMD. 12.10.5.  The  nearest  edge  of  the  tee  or  green  or  the  centerline  of  the  fairway,  for  a  golf course. 12.10.6.  The centerline of a runway. 200 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.10.7.  The nearest edge of an open recreational area. 12.10.8.  The nearest edge of the aircraft cargo hold for internally-loaded explosives. 12.10.9.  The edge of the roadway or pavement, for an ES requiring PTRD. 12.10.10.  The nearest point of an aircraft, if aircraft survivability is required. 12.10.11.  The nearest AE (internal or external) on an aircraft, if only IMD or ILD protection is required. Section 12E—Quantity-Distance (QD) Application 12.11.  QD  K-Factors.  NEWQD  is  used  to  calculate  QD  separations  for  blast  protection  by means of the formula: D = K x NEWQD1/3 D = required distance (in feet) K = protection factor depending on the degree of risk assumed or permitted NEWQD1/3 = cube root of the NEWQD (in pounds) 12.11.1.  Distance  requirements  are  sometimes  expressed  by  the  value  of  K,  using  the terminology K9, K11, K18 meaning K equals 9, K equals 11, K equals 18, etc.  Tables 12.30 and  12.31 provide a listing of distances for various K-factors at various NEWQDs. 12.11.2.  When performing QD calculations using formulae, resulting answers with a decimal value of 0.5 or more may be rounded up to the nearest whole number, and resulting answers with a decimal value of less than 0.5 may  be  rounded down to the nearest whole number (e.g.,if calculating the required distance: D = K (NEWQD)1/3 = 40(1500 lbs)1/3 = 457.89 feet = 458 feet D = K (NEWQD)1/3 = 18(200 lbs)1/3 = 105.26 feet = 105 feet Or, if calculating the allowable NEWQD: NEWQD = (D/K)3 = (1150 feet/40)3 = 23,763.67 lbs = 23,764 lbs NEWQD = (D/K)3 = (700 feet/18)3 = 58,813.44 lbs = 58,813 lbs) 12.12.  Paired Relationships. 12.12.1.  The quantity of explosives allowed in a PES is the most restrictive amount based on analyzing the nearest intermagazine (IM), intraline (IL), public traffic route (PTR), inhabited building (IB) or other exposed site (ES), subject to the NEWQD limitations in paragraph 12.6.    Where  there  are  two  or  more  adjacent  ESs,  the  quantity  allowed  at  the  PES  is  the smallest of the amounts permitted by considering each ES in turn. 12.12.2.  The  QD  criteria  for  a  PES-ES  pair  when  both  contain  AE  are  determined  by considering each location, in turn, as a PES and an ES.  The separation distance required for the pair is the greater of the two separation distances.  An exception is permitted for service magazines  supporting  an  AE  operation;  base  barricaded  or  unbarricaded  (as  appropriate) service magazine separation distances on the NEWQD and the HD of the AE in the magazine and not that in the explosives operating location it supports. 12.13.  QD Determination. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 201 12.13.1.  When  all  AE  in  the  PES  is  HD  1.1,  determine  the  QD  using  Table  12.1.  and Section 12H. 12.13.2.  When  all  AE  in  the  PES  is  HD  1.2,  determine  the  QD  using  Table  12.2.  and Section 12I. 12.13.3.  When  all  AE  in  the  PES  is  HD  1.3,  determine  the  QD  using  Table  12.3.  and Section 12J. 12.13.4.  When  all  AE  in  the  PES  is  HD  1.4,  determine  the  QD  using  Table  12.3.  and Section 12K. 12.13.5.  When all AE in the PES is HD 1.5, treat as HD 1.1 for siting purposes and comply with paragraph 12.13.1. 12.13.6.  When  all  AE  in  the  PES  is  HD  1.6,  determine  the  QD  using  Table  12.3.  and Section 12L. 12.13.7.  When all AE in the PES is HD 6.1, determine the QD using Section 12M. 12.13.8.  When all AE in the PES are energetic liquids, determine the QD using Section 12N. 12.13.9.  When  siting  more  than  one  type  of  AE,  determine  separately  the  QD  criteria  as required for each type of AE per paragraphs 12.13.1. through  12.13.9.  Base required QD separations on the most restrictive QD determined. 12.13.10.  TO 11N-20-7, Nuclear Safety Criteria, provides active materials storage standards for nuclear weapons and when more restrictive, those requirements override QD criteria in this  Manual.    Upon  receipt  of  a  Joint  Test  Assembly,  organizations  will  use  parent  War Reserve  weapon  explosives  criteria  for  storage  and  transportation  while  the  assembly remains in Air Force custody. (T-1). 12.13.11.  If unable to verify QD criteria for a specific weapon system or a given situation, contact  the  appropriate  MAJCOM  for  instructions.    Such  cases  may  include  unusual circumstances,  configurations,  protection  or  hazards.    Storage  and  handling  of  some ammunition  items  are  MAJCOM  unique  and  do  not  fit  into  any  criteria  contained  in  this Manual.    In  such  cases,  request  guidance  in  writing  through  command  channels  to AFSEC/SEW, describing the specific situation, explaining the ammunition item and how it will be stored and handled.  The AFSEC/SEW letter of approval may be incorporated into the MAJCOM supplement to this Manual. Section 12F—Allowable Exposures 12.14.  General.  This  section  identifies  allowable  exposures  to  explosives.    Further  specific guidance  may  be  found  in  the  appropriate  sections  of  this  Manual.   Contact  your MAJCOM/SEW for assistance in determining required separation if guidance is not provided in this Manual. 12.15.  Allowable IBD Exposures. 12.15.1.  Buildings  inhabited  by  people  not  related  to  munitions  or  explosives  work.    The following are examples of facilities not considered “related” to any PES: 202 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.15.1.1.

Main  powerhouses  that  provide  vital  utilities  to  a  major  portion  of  an installation. 12.15.1.17.  Essential warehouses, shops and other facilities that by reason of their vital strategic nature, or high intrinsic value of their contents, must not be placed at risk. 12.15.1.18.  Functions that, if momentarily put out of action, would cause an immediate secondary hazard by reason of their failure to function. 12.15.1.19.  PTRs with high traffic density as described in paragraph 12.3.2.1. 12.15.1.20.  Auxiliary building when not directly related to the explosives mission and when  accessed  by  personnel  not  directly  related  to  the  explosives  mission.

Ground control approach (GCA), radar approach control (RAPCON), and air traffic control (ATC) towers that support a joint use airfield, from all PESs. 12.15.1.25.  GCA, RAPCON, and ATC towers that support a military use only airfield, from non- flightline PESs.  Base the IBD on blast overpressure only; fragment distances are not applied. 12.15.1.26.  Hazardous waste collection points not exclusively supporting an explosives area. 12.15.1.27.  Unoccupied  structures  housing  weather  equipment  not  exclusively supporting an explosives area.  Base the IBD on overpressure only; fragment distances are not applied. 12.15.1.28.  Activities  such  as  concerts,  bazaars,  and  ceremonies  (e.g.,  change  of command, etc.) attended by people not related to munitions or explosives work. 12.15.1.29.  Construction activities that are not related to existing explosives facilities or operations. 12.15.2.  Installation boundary.  If a proposed PES would create an IBD clear zone extending beyond the base boundary, the hazard becomes a legal issue.  Identify existing exposures in the ESP request package and obtain DDESB approval. (T-1).  An IBD arc may fall outside of the installation boundary, without causing an exception to QD requirements, provided one of the following methods of protecting the public and public property is complied with: Note:  Restrictive easements, Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs), and Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) do not address existing exposures encumbered by the explosives clear zone of the PES.   12.15.2.1.  Off-base  land  owned  by  a  Federal,  State,  or  Municipal  agency  in  the Continental United States (CONUS) or its possessions or territories. 12.15.2.1.1.  An  existing  restrictive  easement  MOA  or  MOU  encompasses  the  off-base land encumbered by the explosives clear zone of the PES.  Prior to establishing the PES, Safety (SE), CE, and JA representatives must review and ensure compliance with  applicable  in-place  restrictive  easement,  MOA,  or  MOU  rights.  (T-1).    The Commander  will  designate  personnel  to  perform  a  quarterly  review  of  the  area  to ensure compliance with the restrictive easement, MOA, or MOU. (T-1). 12.15.2.1.2.  A new restrictive easement, MOA,  or MOU is obtained from the land owner  for  the  off-base  land  encumbered  by  the  explosives  clear  zone  prior  to establishing  or  constructing  the  PES.    Before  funding  construction,  the  installation Commander, Facility Board, and facility user must be briefed and accept the need to reduce or eliminate NEWQD in the user's facility to prevent an exception providing the desired restrictive easement is not obtained. (T-1).  Request for preliminary ESP approval  may  be  sought  prior  to  obtaining  the  restrictive  easement.    Submit documentation  substantiating  coordination  of  the  restrictive  easement  with  the  Air Force  Real  Property  Agency  (AFRPA)  and  recording  with  the  USACE  prior  to submission  and  request  for  final  ESP  approval.  (T-1).    The  Commander  will designate personnel to perform a quarterly review of the area to ensure compliance with the restrictive easement. (T-1). 204 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.15.2.1.3.  Off-base  land  owned  by  another  DoD  agency.    In  cases  where  an  Air Force PES generates an explosives IBD clear zone encroaching onto property owned by another DoD service, the local Air Force organization responsible for submitting the ESP will obtain written acknowledgement from the exposed service component SE and CE equivalent offices for inclusion with the ESP submission package. (T-1).  It is up to the acknowledging agency to update  their maps to reflect the Air Force explosives clear zone for their future planning purposes and to notify the Air Force unit  of  any  planned  exposures.    The  MAJCOM  and  AFSEC/SEW  will  coordinate with  the  applicable  service  component  equivalent  prior  to  requesting  DDESB  ESP approval.  (T-1).    Recommend  establishing  an  MOU  or  MOA  with  the  other  DoD agency. 12.15.2.1.4.  Off-base land owned by other Federal Agencies.  In cases where an Air Force PES generates an explosives IBD clear zone encroaching onto property owned by another federal agency, the local Air Force organization responsible for submitting the ESP will obtain written acknowledgement from the exposed agency SE and CE equivalent offices for inclusion with the ESP submission package. (T-1).  It is up to the acknowledging  agency to update their maps  to reflect the  Air Force  explosives clear zone for their future planning purposes and to notify the Air Force unit of any planned  exposures.    AFSEC/SEW  will  coordinate  with  the  applicable  agency equivalent  prior  to  requesting  DDESB  ESP  approval.  (T-1).   Recommend establishing an MOU or MOA with the other Federal agency. 12.15.2.2.  Off-base land owned by a private land owner requires a restrictive easement.  All other requirements stated above in paragraphs 12.15.2.1.1. and  12.15.2.1.2. apply. 12.15.2.3.  The  off-base  land  encumbered  by  the  explosives  clear  zone  is  open  and manifestly unsuitable for habitation or public gatherings, is government land that is not open  to  the  public,  or  access  is  restricted  and  controlled  by  other  means.    Only appropriate  local  government  agencies  for  public  safety,  environment  and  health  can declare  land  outside  the  base  boundary  unsuitable  for  habitation  or  public  gatherings.  Maintain  documentation  determining  this  land  unsuitable  for  habitation  or  public gatherings  with  real  property  records.  (T-1).    The  Commander,  Facility  Board,  and facility user must be briefed and accept the need to reduce or eliminate NEWQD in the PES  creating  the  clear  zone  to  prevent  an  exception  providing  a  new  encumbrance occurs. (T-1).  The Commander will designate personnel to perform quarterly reviews of the  area  to  ensure  it  remains  open,  uninhabited,  and  unused  and  must  periodically reconsider obtaining a restrictive easement, MOA, MOU or purchase of the land. (T-1). 12.15.2.4.  Establishing  a  clear  zone  beyond  the  installation  boundary  that  does  not involve a private land owner and where no new construction is involved.  If the IBD clear zone extends past the installation boundary, an exception must accompany the QD safety submission unless the following compensatory measures can be accomplished: (T-1). letter  of  agreement  (LOA)  between 12.15.2.4.1.  A  signed installation Commander and airport manager stating that non-related personnel and activities are not exposed when the mission generating the clear zone is implemented.  LOAs are not  intended  to  insinuate  the  land  owner  accepts  the  risk,  but  rather  to  confirm exposures are eliminated when mission accomplishment dictates need. the AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 205 12.15.2.4.2.  LOAs  must  address  termination  terms  of  the  LOA  in  writing  with  the appropriate parties. (T-1).  Coordinate the LOA with CE and JA to validate all the terms of the agreement. 12.16.  Allowable PTRD Exposures. 12.16.1.  PTRs  with  medium  traffic  density  as  described  in  paragraph  12.3.2.2.    Medium traffic  density  criteria  apply,  as  a  minimum,  to  recreational  activity  that  is  extensive  and occurs on a regular basis. 12.16.2.  PTRs with low traffic density as described in paragraph 12.3.2.3.  The PTRD will be  based  on  blast  overpressure  only;  fragment  distances  will  not  be  used.    Normal  PTRD required for HD 1.2.X. 12.16.3.  On-Base Roads.  On-base roads traveled by personnel not involved in munitions-related operations are now considered PTR.  QD criteria are based on the traffic density (see paragraphs  12.3.2.1.,    12.3.2.2.  and    12.3.2.3.).    In  order  to  prevent  the  generation  of  a significant number of QD exemptions for existing roads, the procedures below are provided for assessing, documenting, and accepting the risks associated with application of QD criteria to on-base roads for PES/on-base road relationships existing prior to 1 October 2000.  After 1 October  2000,  any  changes  to  a  PES  increasing  its  QD  arc,  construction  of  a  new  PES, construction of a new on-base road, or change in traffic density, requires the application of QD criteria to on-base roads traveled by  personnel not involved in PES-related operations (see also paragraph A5.3.)  If QD criteria cannot be met, obtain an exemption per Section 1B. 12.16.3.1.  For  those  sited  PES/on-base  road  relationships  existing  prior  to  1  October 2000 accomplish the following risk assessment and documentation: 12.16.3.1.1.  On a copy of the installation map, identify the following: 12.16.3.1.1.1.  All PESs having QD arcs (PTRD or IBD based on traffic density) encompassing  on-base  roads  traveled  by  personnel  not  involved  in  munitions-related operations. 12.16.3.1.1.2.  The NEWQD of the above PESs. 12.16.3.1.1.3.  The applicable QD arcs (PTR or IBD) of the above PESs based on the traffic density. 12.16.3.1.1.4.  The segments of the applicable on-base roads passing through the above arcs. 12.16.3.1.2.  Perform  a  risk  assessment  of  the  relationships  shown  above  IAW Chapter 4.  Some factors that might be considered include: 12.16.3.1.2.1.  Operational necessity. 12.16.3.1.2.2.  The  operation  being  performed  (e.g.,  static  storage,  maintenance, and production). 12.16.3.1.2.3.  Operational activity cycles. 12.16.3.1.2.4.  Alternate routes. 206 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.16.3.1.2.5.  Traffic density. 12.16.3.1.2.6.  Accident records. 12.16.3.1.2.7.  Time interval of exposure. 12.16.3.1.2.8.  Type and quantity of munitions in proximity to the area transited. 12.16.3.1.2.9.  The closest distance from the area transited to the PES. 12.16.3.1.2.10.  The need for installation-related personnel to transit the QD arc. 12.16.3.1.2.11.  Consideration  of  methods  to  inform  transients  of  potential  risks (e.g., written acknowledgement of the risk by vendors or others with a recurring need to transit the QD arc, warning signs, flashing lights, physical barriers, etc.). the  Commander’s  risk  acceptance 12.16.3.1.3.  Document through  a  formal memorandum.  (T-1).  This  memorandum  must  include  the  map  showing  the relationships accepting risk, a summary of the risk assessment, and a statement that the subject relationships existed as of 1 October 2000.  Upon change of approving authority, ensure the new Commander is informed of the previous  risk  acceptance. (T-1). 12.16.3.2.  Include the Commander’s risk acceptance and attached map in amendments to ESPs  (for  PESs  existing  prior  to  1  October  2000)  or  reference  if  previously  submitted with another ESP amendment. (T-1). 12.16.4.  Open-air  recreation  facilities  (e.g.,  ball  diamonds,  golf  courses,  and  volleyball courts);  not  containing  structures  used  for  community  relations  purposes  at  military installations.  As an exception, neither blast nor fragment criteria apply, when such facilities are  located  near  AE  support  operations  and  are  used  only  by  off-duty  military  or  on-duty military  or  DoD  civilians  or  contractors  (e.g.,  munitions  workers,  security  guards, firefighters) who directly support these AE operations.  This does not authorize the building of  elaborate  structures  that  substitute  for  properly  sited  recreational  facilities  or  the collocation of unrelated military functions.  Separate at ILD from other related PESs. 12.16.5.  Open, military only or other combatant-type training, areas.  If areas include fixed facilities, including small classrooms designed for occasional use coincident with the use of the training area, apply incremental IBD with a minimum of PTRD for fragmentation to the facility.  As an exception, to allow for realism in training, this separation does not apply to AE needed for any particular exercise or on-the-job training.   However,  this separation or equivalent protection is required from permanent PESs. 12.16.6.  Aircraft battle damage repair training areas. 12.16.7.  Open-air aircraft passenger loading and unloading areas. 12.16.8.  Parking lots for administrative areas.  See paragraph 12.66.2. 12.16.9.  Auxiliary  storage  located  in  the  open  (no  structures  involved)  when  not  directly related to the explosives mission and when accessed by personnel not directly related to the explosives mission.  See paragraph 12.67.2 and paragraph 12.15.1.20., if located within a structure. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 207 12.16.10.  Unmanned  antenna/antenna  farms  when  not  directly  related  to  the  explosives mission.  These are facilities that generate electromagnetic radiation which may or may not pose a threat to EIDs.  A greater distance may be required to protect EIDs at the PES.  See AFI  91-208  to  determine  SSDs.    PTRD  is  based  on  blast  overpressure  only;  fragment distances are not required. 12.16.11.  Unoccupied  weather  equipment  (antennas,  ceilometers,  etc.)  not  exclusively supporting an explosives area and when located in the open.  The PTRD will be based on overpressure only; fragment distances will not be used. 12.16.12.  Joint DoD-non-DoD use taxiway.  A taxiway serving both DoD and commercial aircraft.    A  taxiway  serving  solely  DoD,  DoD  chartered,  or  non-DoD  aircraft  on  DoD authorized business is not joint use. 12.16.13.  Provide operating personnel exposed to explosives research, development and test operations that are conducted by remote control procedures protection per paragraph 4.17.,  4.18.1., and  4.18.2.  Also provide non-related personnel IBD protection. 12.16.14.  Land used for agricultural purposes.  Apply PTRD without a minimum fragment distance for new PES locations or when a new ESP is required for an existing PES and the following conditions exist: 12.16.14.1.  The exposure is frequent or higher,  as described in Table 1.2. (e.g., when manual  methods  and  numerous  laborers  are  needed  for  certain  types  of  crops  or locations). 12.16.14.2.  The  exposure  is  determined  to  be  occasional  or  lower  (QD  not  required).  See Table 1.2. 12.17.  Allowable  Unbarricaded  ILD  Exposures.  For  the  following  situations,  the  use  of unbarricaded ILD may be used: 12.17.1.  Explosives operating locations (e.g., surveillance, maintenance, inspection) directly related  to  the  PES;  the  PES  may  be  explosives  storage  or  operating  location.    When necessary  to  conduct  dissimilar  concurrent  operations,  arrange  operations  to  provide  a minimum of ILD protection either by distance or equivalent protection, or must be operations not requiring QD separation.  MAJCOM supplements to this Manual provide guidance on determining whether operations within a single facility require QD separation and factors to consider are: 12.17.1.1.  Whether the same personnel are involved in both operations (e.g., AE workers are assigned to the same flight and move between operations as required). 12.17.1.2.  Whether the same AE are involved in both operations (e.g., air-to-air missiles, chaff or flare). 12.17.1.3.  Whether the operations are the same type (e.g., inspection, buildup). 12.17.1.4.  Whether  the  AE  involved  in  both  operations  presents  similar  hazards  (e.g., same HD or CG). 12.17.2.  Parallel  operating  lines,  provided  the  AE  involved  in  each  operating  line  present similar hazards.  Provide successive steps within a single explosives process or operation as 208 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 much protection as practical, but do not require QD separation.  If the successive steps are housed in separate facilities provide ILD separation between facilities. Note:  The criticality or survivability of one or more of the operating lines may require that each line be given IBD-level protection.   12.17.3.  Non-explosives  facilities,  excluding  magazine-area  loading  docks  that  are  used exclusively in support of a PES or explosives area.  Such facilities include: 12.17.3.1.  Gatehouses. 12.17.3.2.  Field  offices  for  branch  or  flight  level  supervision,  Munitions  Operations (AFK), munitions control, training, mobility, etc.  See paragraph 12.20.3.4. for offices of personnel who perform hands-on work and their first level supervisors. 12.17.3.3.  Dunnage preparation. 12.17.3.4.  Small packing and shipping buildings. 12.17.3.5.  Dog kennels. 12.17.3.6.  Area security control (apply IBD to BDOC per paragraph 12.15.1.12.). 12.17.3.7.  Motor pool dispatch points (for vehicles supporting storage area only). 12.17.3.8.  Staffed power plants and staffed non-explosive hazardous material collection points. 12.17.3.9.  Response Force Tactical Facilities (RFTF). 12.17.3.10.  Lunch rooms. 12.17.3.11.  Break rooms and change houses supporting multiple PESs. 12.17.3.12.  Inert operations involving components of an explosive weapon system; the operation must involve support of an explosive operation such as repairing bomb fins, or the operation simulates an explosive operation. 12.17.3.13.  Auxiliary  fire  stations  (apply  IBD  to  main  base  support  fire  stations  per paragraph 12.15.1.11.). 12.17.3.14.  Training facilities. 12.17.3.15.  Manned facilities of a defensive or tactical missile battery. 12.17.3.16.  GCA, RAPCON, and ATC towers that support a military use only airfield from flightline PESs. 12.17.3.17.  Unmanned  antenna/antenna  farms.    These  are  facilities  that  generate electromagnetic  radiation  which  may  or  may  not  pose  a  threat  to  EIDs.    A  greater distance may be required to protect EIDs at the PES.  See AFI 91-208 to determine SSD. 12.17.3.18.  Unoccupied  weather  equipment  facilities  from  the  explosives  area  being supported. 12.17.3.19.  Maintenance  of  military  vehicles  or  equipment  that  is  located  OCONUS when the PES is a basic load or a ready storage area.  In such cases: 12.17.3.19.1.  The NEWQD at each PES is limited to 8,818 lbs or less. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 209 12.17.3.19.2.  The maintenance work is performed exclusively for the unit for where AE is stored. 12.17.4.  Auxiliary  power  and  utilities  functions including  auxiliary  power  plants; compressor stations; electric power transformers; tool and consumable supplies storage and issue;  and  handling  equipment  service,  battery  charging,  and  minor  repair.    When  such facilities serve an entire base complex, or when loss of the facility will cause an immediate loss of vital function, the minimum exposure level is IBD. 12.17.5.  Minimum  distance  between  separate  groups  of  AE-loaded,  combat-configured aircraft.  For QD purposes, all combat forces at a single location are considered related.  This may  include  Air  Force,  Army,  Navy,  Marines,  and  host-nation  aircraft.    One  set  of  QD criteria applies to all combat forces at a single location (e.g., facilities or functions related to Air  Force  fighter  aircraft  are  also  related  to  Navy  fighter  aircraft).    When  the  services disagree  on  the  required  QD,  forward  the  problem  through  MAJCOM  channels  to AFSEC/SEW  for  action.  (T-1).  Use  intervening  barricades  to  eliminate  propagation  by primary fragment impact; thereby eliminating the need to total NEWQD. Note:  Loading AE aboard aircraft can be accomplished with each group of aircraft without additional protection. 12.17.6.  Combat Aircraft Related Activities.  See paragraph 12.40. 12.17.7.  Explosive Cargo Aircraft Related Activities.  See paragraph 12.41. 12.17.8.  Munitions or Weapons Storage Area Related Activities.  See paragraph 12.42. 12.17.9.

Survivable Collective Protection System (SCPS) with a minimum of five feet earth cover-K3; with a minimum of three feet but less than five feet of earth cover-K5. Note:  SCPS built before 1 September 1988 at less than minimum separation distances for occupied facilities from HASs do not require a waiver or exemption.  See paragraph 12.50.13. 210 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.17.11.  Construction  activities  exposed  by  related  PESs.  This  separation  requirement applies to all construction activities related to PESs whether being accomplished by civilian, military,  or  host-nation  personnel.    Document  a  risk  assessment,  including  the  control measures taken and ensure all construction personnel are made aware of the explosives risks and  evacuation  procedures  (e.g.,  emergency  and  lightning  response)  (see  Chapter  4).  Locally  maintain  the  risk  assessment  documentation  until  operations  have  been  completed and  personnel  have  permanently  vacated  the  work  site.    If  this  separation  cannot  be maintained, obtain a waiver per Section 1B. (T-1).  Apply IBD IAW paragraph 12.15. to all construction activities not related to existing PESs. 12.18.  Allowable Barricaded ILD Exposures. 12.18.1.  Continue to use K9 to properly barricade facilities sited at K9 before 1 June 1980 until  a  revised  siting  of  that  facility  is  necessary,  except  as  noted  in  paragraph  12.18.2.  Comply with this Manual when resiting these facilities. 12.18.2.  Use  Barricaded  ILD  for  the  following  facilities  with  barricades  meeting  the construction  and  location  criteria  of  Section  6E,  or  from  the  side  or  rear  of  ECMs  per paragraph 12.24.2.: 12.18.2.1.  Occupied  facilities  of  a  defensive  or  tactical  missile  battery  where  greater distances from the PES cannot be provided for technical or tactical reasons. 12.18.2.2.

Unoccupied  auxiliary  utility  functions  (e.g.,  transformer  stations,  water  treatment and  pollution  abatement  facilities)  that  serve  an  explosives  area,  but  are  not  an  integral function in the explosives area, and that would not create an immediate secondary hazard if lost.  Such unmanned facilities need not be barricaded. 12.19.  Allowable  IMD  Exposures.  An  allowable  IMD  exposure  is  container  stuffing  and unstuffing operations in magazine areas that provide routine support to multiple PESs. 12.20.  Other Allowable Exposures. 12.20.1.  Facilities  that  exclusively  support  an  explosives  area  may  be  separated  from  the PESs in the explosives area as follows: AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 211 12.20.1.1.  Unmanned  hazardous  material  collection  points  may  be  located  at  fire protection  distance  (50  feet  for  non-combustible  structures,  100  feet  for  combustible structures). 12.20.1.2.  When essential for security purposes, site one-person guard towers at 50 feet.  One person guard shelters require no QD. 12.20.1.3.  Unmanned  auxiliary  power  generation  or  conversion  facilities  (e.g.,  power plants, transformers, etc.) that exclusively supply power to an explosives area or security fence  lighting  may  be  located  at  fire  protection  distance  (50  feet  for  non-combustible structures, 100 feet for combustible structures). 12.20.1.4.  Small  latrines  may  be  located  at  fire  protection  distance  (50  feet  for  non-combustible structures, 100 feet for combustible structures).  This facility type is limited to toilets and sinks and do not contain showers, clothing lockers, or other conveniences. 12.20.2.  The following facilities that exclusively support a single PES may be located at fire protection  distance  (50  feet  for  non-combustible  structures,  100  feet  for  combustible structures) from the PES they support; provide separation to all other PESs: 12.20.2.1.  Transformers. 12.20.2.2.  Low  pressure  boilers.    Some  specially  designed  operating  buildings  have attached rooms for low-pressure boilers and other facilities.  These buildings have safety features such as protective concrete separating walls (without openings) between boiler and  working  areas,  light  roof  and  frangible  exterior  walls  for  boiler  enclosures.    Such buildings, built according to Air Force definitive drawings, require no separation.  This exception applies only where equipment installed or contained in attached rooms meets or exceeds original specifications and does not create additional hazards. 12.20.2.3.  Paint storage buildings. 12.20.2.4.  Auxiliary  facilities such as heating plants, line offices, break  areas, briefing rooms for daily work schedules or site safety matters, joiner shops, security posts, and similar functions. 12.20.3.  The following facilities require no QD or fire protection distance separation: 12.20.3.1.  One-person  security  structures  for  weapons-loaded  aircraft;  provide  fire protection distance separation when possible. 12.20.3.2.  Defensive fighting positions. 12.20.3.3.  Break rooms, supply rooms, and change houses integral to a PES. 12.20.3.4.  Offices,  integral  to  a  PES,  of  personnel  who  perform  hands-on  work  in  the PES  (e.g.,  assemble,  maintain,  inspect,  and  test),  and  the  NCOIC  and  first  level supervisors (crew chiefs) of those who do hands-on work. 12.20.4.  Abandoned  facilities  require  no  QD;  however,  fire  protection  distance  separation applies:  These facilities may or may not be scheduled for demolition. 212 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Section 12G—Hazard Zones for ECMs and HASs 12.21.  Hazard Zones for ECMs and HASs.  QD criteria for ECMs and HASs are dependent upon the orientation of these PESs.  The QD criteria in this Manual refer to “front,” “side,” and “rear” relationships for ECMs and HASs. 12.21.1.  Use Figure 12.1. to determine whether an ES is exposed to the front, side or rear of an ECM. 12.21.1.1.  The forward sector, or “front,” for an ECM is that area 60 degrees either side of  the  ECM's  centerline  (120  degrees  combined  angle),  with  the  vertex  of  the  angle placed so that the sides  of the angle pass through the intersection of the headwall and sidewalls. 12.21.1.2.  The rear sector, or “rear,” of an ECM is that area 45 degrees either side of the magazine centerline (90 degrees combined angle) with the vertex of the angle placed so that the sides of the angle pass through the intersection of the rear and side walls. 12.21.1.3.  All other orientations are considered “side” sectors. 12.21.2.  Use Figure 12.2. to determine ECM to ECM orientation effects on IMD. 12.21.3.  Use Figure 12.3. to determine whether an ES is exposed to the front, side or rear of a HAS. Section 12H—HD  1.1 QD Criteria 12.22.  HD    1.1  Hazardous  Fragment  Distances.  Base  the  minimum  distance  for  protection from hazardous fragments on primary and secondary fragments from the PES and the population or traffic density of the ES.  The hazardous fragment distance (HFD) is defined as the distance at which the density of hazardous fragments becomes one per 600 ft2. Note:  This distance is not the maximum fragment range. 12.22.1.  The HFD may be determined by: 12.22.1.1.  Default values, such as those shown in Table 12.4. for primary fragments or Tables 12.4. and  12.10. secondary fragments. 12.22.1.2.  Some  items  have  been  evaluated  for  minimum  HFD  with  results  shown  in Table 12.5. 12.22.1.3.  Some items, through testing, have been hazard classified with a specific HFD presented in the format HD (xx) 1.1.  The HFD for these items is specified in hundreds of feet (in parenthesis).  These items may or may not be listed in Table 12.5. 12.22.1.4.  DDESB-approved  analyses  and  approved  tests  may  be  used  to  determine minimum  distances  for  both  primary  and  secondary  fragments.    DDESB  TP  13, Prediction of Building Debris for Quantity-Distance Siting is an example of a method to determine minimal distances for building debris, while DDESB TP 16, Methodologies for Calculating  Primary  Fragment  Characteristics  and  DDESB  TP  10,  Change  3, Methodology For Chemical Hazard Predictions provide similar information for primary fragments. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 213 12.22.2.  Examples  when  minimum  hazardous  fragment  and  firebrand  distances  need  not apply are: 12.22.2.1.  Recreation  or  training  facilities  when  such  facilities  are  located  near  AE support operations and are used by off-duty military or on-duty military or DoD civilians or contractors (e.g., munitions workers, security guards, firefighters) that directly support these AE operations. 12.22.2.2.  Related  and  support  DoD-controlled  functions  where  IMD  and  ILD  would normally apply. 12.22.2.3.  Maintenance, supply, training facilities, and operations offices for logistical or operational  support  of  combat  aircraft,  battalion-size  or  smaller  delivery  or  AE  supply units, separate air defense firing batteries, or a single pier or wharf for which the AE in a PES is intended. 12.22.2.4.  Between a PES and inert storage, whether in a facility or in the open. 12.22.2.5.  Between facilities in an operating line; between operating lines; and between operating lines and storage locations. 12.22.3.  Minimum hazardous fragment distances apply to: 12.22.3.1.  An installation's boundary. 12.22.3.2.  Administration and housing areas. 12.22.3.3.  Recreation facilities (e.g., ball diamonds, golf courses and volleyball courts). Note:  See paragraph 12.22.2.1. for situations where minimum fragment distances do not apply to recreational facilities. 12.22.3.4.  Flightline passenger service functions (e.g., terminal buildings). 12.22.3.5.  Utilities that provide vital functions to a major portion of an installation. 12.22.3.6.  Auxiliary storage and shops that by reason of their vital strategic nature, or high intrinsic value of their contents, must not be placed at risk. 12.22.3.7.  Functions that, if momentarily put out of action, would cause an immediate secondary hazard by reason of their failure to function. 12.22.3.8.  POVs parked in administrative areas. 12.23.  HD    1.1  IBD  and  PTRD.  Table  12.1.  provides  a  summary  matrix  of  all  the  paired relationships  for  HD  1.1.    For  locations  provided  IBD  or  PTRD  protection  per  paragraphs 12.15. and  12.16., the HD 1.1 IBD and PTRD are as follows: 12.23.1.  HD 1.1 NEWQD < 450 lbs. 12.23.1.1.  For HD 1.1 in a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. 12.23.1.2.  For  HD  1.1  in  an  Undefined  ECM  where  the  loading  density  (NEWQD (lbs)/internal volume (ft3)) is < 0.028 lbs/ft3, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. 214 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.23.1.3.  For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density is > 0.028 lbs/ft3, use ECM Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. for side/rear exposures.  For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the ECM Front IBD as shown in Table 12.6., the HFD  found  in  Table  12.4.,  the  specific  item  HFD  as  shown  in  Table  12.5.,  or  the parenthetical fragment distance, whichever is greater.  When using Table 12.4., use the “Structure”  column  only  if  the  ECM  headwall  meets  the  definition  of  aboveground structure  heavy  wall  (AGS  (H))  as  defined  in  the  legend  of  Table  12.2.  or  for  non-fragment producing explosives.  PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.1.4.  Where  ECM,  regardless  of  structural  designation,  have  been  designed, analyzed,  or  tested  to  have  a  reduced  IBD  and  PTRD  and  have  been  approved  by  the DDESB, use the approved IBD and PTRD. 12.23.1.5.  For  HD  1.1  in  a  structure  (excluding  ECM)  capable  of  stopping  primary fragments, and contributing to the debris hazard, use the HFD listed in the “Structure” column  of  Table  12.4.    PTRD  is  60  percent  of  HFD.    Structures  that  are  capable  of stopping primary fragments include all heavy wall (H) and heavy wall/roof (H/R) AGS, as  defined  in  the  Legend  for  Table  12.2.    Doors  and  other  openings  where  primary fragments  could  exit  must  be  capable  of  stopping  primary  fragments  from  exiting  the facility or will be barricaded IAW Section 6E to trap primary fragments that could exit the facility.  All other structures (other than ECM) are considered incapable of stopping primary fragments. 12.23.1.6.  Selected items have been evaluated for minimum HFD with results shown in Table  12.5.    Other  items,  through  testing,  have  been  hazard  classified  with  a  specific HFD  presented  in  the  format  HD  (xx)  1.1.    The  HFD  for  these  items  is  specified  in hundreds of feet (in parenthesis), and may not be listed in Table 12.5.  The HFD for these two categories apply only to items in the open.  When in facilities, consider secondary debris  as  well  as  primary  fragments.    If  in  a  facility  incapable  of  stopping  primary fragments, IBD is the greater of the HFD for Open locations as shown in Table 12.4., the specific item HFD as shown in Table 12.5., or the parenthetical fragment distance.  For items  not  listed  in  Table  12.5.  or  assigned  a  parenthetical  fragment  distance,  use  the Open column of Table 12.4.  PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.1.7.  For  bare  (non-fragment  producing)  explosives  in  any  structure  (excluding ECM),  truck,  trailer,  or  railcar  that  may  contribute  to  the  debris  hazard,  use  the  HFD listed in the “Structure” column of Table 12.4. PTRD is 60 percent of HFD. 12.23.1.8.  For bare (non-fragment producing) explosives in the open, IBD is K40; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.1.9.  For exposures not requiring fragment protection per paragraph 12.22.2., IBD is K40; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.2.  HD 1.1 NEWQDs in the range 451 to 30,000 lbs. 12.23.2.1.  The  minimum  HFD  is  1250  feet.    Consider  facilities  sited  at  1,235  feet  or 1,245  feet  per  past  standards  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  1,250  feet  minimum requirement. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 215 12.23.2.2.  For HD 1.1 in a 7-Bar or a 3-Bar ECM, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. 12.23.2.3.  For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density is < 0.028 lbs/ft3, use ECM Front/Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. 12.23.2.4.  For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM with minimum internal dimensions of 26 feet wide and 60 feet long, use ECM Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6., for side/rear exposures.  For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the Other PES IBD as shown  in  Table  12.6.,  or  the  parenthetical  fragment  distance  if  it  is  greater  than  1250 feet; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.2.5.  For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where the loading density is > 0.028 lbs/ft3 and internal dimensions are less than 26 feet wide and 60 feet long, use Other PES IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. for side and rear exposures.  For front exposures, IBD is  the  greater  of  the  Other  PES  IBD  as  shown  in  Table  12.6.,  or  the  parenthetical fragment distance if it is greater than 1250 feet; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.2.6.  For  HD  1.1  in  a  structure  (excluding  ECM),  use  the  Other  PES  IBD  and PTRD  distances  as  shown  in  Table  12.6.    However,  if  the  item  has  a  parenthetical fragment distance that is greater than 1250 feet, use the parenthetical fragment distance as the IBD; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.2.7.  For HD 1.1 in the open, use the Other PES IBD and PTRD distances as shown in Table 12.6.  However, if the item has a parenthetical fragment distance or a specific item HFD distance as shown in Table 12.5., this value may be used in place of the 1250 feet minimum HFD.  IBD is the greater of K40, or the parenthetical fragment distance or specific item HFD as shown in Table 12.5.; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.2.8.  For bare (non-fragment producing) explosives in the open, IBD is K40; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.2.9.  For exposures not requiring fragment protection per paragraph 12.22.2., IBD is K40; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.3.  HD 1.1 NEWQDs > 30,000 lbs. 12.23.3.1.  For  HD  1.1  in  a  7-Bar  or  a  3-Bar  ECM  where  internal  dimensions  are  a minimum of 26 feet wide and 60 feet long, use ECM IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. 12.23.3.2.  For  HD  1.1  in  a  7-Bar  or  a  3-Bar  ECM  where  internal  dimensions  are  less than 26 feet wide and 60 feet long, use Other PES IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. for front, side and rear exposures. 12.23.3.3.  For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where internal dimensions are a minimum of 26 feet wide and 60 feet long, use ECM Side/Rear IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. for side/rear exposures.  For front exposures, IBD is the greater of the Other PES IBD as shown in Table 12.6., or the parenthetical fragment distance if it is greater than 1250 feet; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.3.4.  For HD 1.1 in an Undefined ECM where internal dimensions are less than 26 feet wide and 60 feet long, use Other PES IBD and PTRD as shown in Table 12.6. for 216 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 side/rear  exposures.  For front exposures,  IBD is the  greater of the Other PES  IBD  as shown  in  Table  12.6.,  or  the  parenthetical  fragment  distance  if  it  is  greater  than  1250 feet; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.3.5.  For HD 1.1 in a structure (excluding ECM) or in the open, use the Other PES IBD  and  PTRD  distances  as  shown  in  Table  12.6.    However,  if  the  item  has  a parenthetical  fragment  distance  that  is  greater  than  1,250  feet,  use  the  parenthetical fragment distance as the IBD; PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.23.3.6.  For exposures not requiring fragment protection per paragraph 12.22.2., IBD is K40/50 as described in Table 12.6., Note 3.  PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD. 12.24.  HD  1.1 ILD.  Table 12.1.  provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.1. 12.24.1.  Unbarricaded  ILD  from  an  ECM.    Testing  has  shown  that  some  attenuation  of airblast overpressure relative to an unconfined surface burst occurs out the sides and rear of an  ECM  and  a  slight  increase  occurs  out  the  front  of  an  ECM.    The  equivalent  K18 unbarricaded ILD from an ECM, when accounting for this attenuation, is as shown in Table 12.7. for exposures permitted at unbarricaded ILD per paragraph 12.17. Note:  Airblast forms the basis for the equations given in the notes to Table 12.7. and per paragraph 12.17.10., some hardened structures may be sited at a reduced unbarricaded ILD. 12.24.2.  Barricaded ILD from an ECM.  The equivalent K9 barricaded ILD from an ECM is as shown in Table 12.7. for exposures permitted at barricaded  ILD per  paragraph 12.18.  Use  of  barricaded  ILD  from  the  front  of  an  ECM  requires  that  a  properly  constructed, intervening barricade be located between the ES and the PES per Section 6E.  If an ECM's earth cover meets all construction criteria of Section 6E, it qualifies as a barricade and use of barricaded ILD from the sides or rear of the ECM is permissible.  Failure of the ECM's earth cover to meet the criteria of Section 6E requires use of unbarricaded ILD for siting purposes. 12.24.3.  Unbarricaded ILD from Other than an ECM.  The unbarricaded ILD from all PESs other than ECMs is as shown in Table 12.8. for exposures permitted at unbarricaded ILD per paragraph 12.17. Note:  Per paragraph 12.17.10., some hardened structures may be sited at a reduced unbarricaded ILD. 12.24.4.  Barricaded ILD from Other than an ECM.  The barricaded ILD from all PESs other than  ECMs  is  as  shown  in  Table  12.8.  for  exposures  permitted  at  barricaded  ILD  per paragraph 12.18.  Use of barricaded ILD requires that a properly constructed, intervening barricade be located between the ES and the PES per Section 6E. 12.25.  HD  1.1 IMD.  IMD from magazines is as shown in Table 12.1.  The IM distances given for  100  lbs  NEW  in  Tables  12.30.  and    12.31.  constitute  the  minimum magazine  separations permitted. 12.25.1.  Barricaded IMD from an ECM.  Use of barricaded IMD from the front of an ECM requires that a properly constructed, intervening barricade be located between the ES and the PES per Section 6E.  If an ECM's earth cover meets all construction criteria of Section 6E, it qualifies  as  a  barricade  and  use  of  barricaded  IMD  from  the  sides  or  rear  of  the  ECM  is AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 217 permissible.  Failure of  the ECM's earth cover to meet the criteria of Section 6E requires application of unbarricaded IMD for siting purposes. 12.25.2.  Barricaded  IMD from an  AGM.  Use  of barricaded  IMD from an AGM requires that a properly constructed, intervening barricade be located between the ES and the PES.  This barricade must meet the construction and location criteria of Section 6E. Section 12I—HD  1.2 QD Criteria 12.26.  HD  1.2.1 and  1.2.2 QD Criteria. 12.26.1.  Small  quantities  of  HD  1.2.1  (<  450  pounds  NEWQD),  in  certain  packaging configurations,  react  in  a  manner  more  typical  of  an  HD  1.1  event.    When  located  in structures that stop primary fragments and generate a secondary debris hazard (e.g., certain ECM  and  hardened  structures),  the  structural  damage  and  debris  hazards  produced  from these  events  are  more  characteristic  of  an  HD  1.1  explosion,  rather  than  the  progressive nature of an HD 1.2.1 event.  When the NEWQD and the MCE of the packaged HD 1.2.1 items fall within the ranges specified in the equation NEWQD < MCE < 450 lbs (meaning that there will only be a single HD 1.2.1 event and it will involve less than or equal to 450 lbs), treat the HD 1.2.1 as HD 1.1 and use paragraph 12.23.1.1. criteria. 12.26.2.  The  QD  criteria  for  HD  1.2.1  items  are  based  on  the  hazards  from  primary fragments  and  secondary  debris.    Structures  that  may  contribute  secondary  debris  include:  frontal exposures from  ECMs; cargo  aircraft (with internally loaded  AE); all aboveground structures, including heavy wall (H), heavy wall/roof (H/R), and light wall (L) as defined in Table 12.2.; and trucks, trailers, and railcars (with internally loaded AE).  All structures are presumed to produce secondary debris unless data or analyses are provided, and approved by AFSEC/SEW, to show that the structural debris contribution is less than that shown in Table 12.10.  Secondary debris evaluation is not required for externally-loaded AE on aircraft and stacks of AE on open trucks, trailers, or railcars. 12.26.3.  The  QD  criteria  for  HD  1.2.2  items  are  based  on  the  hazards  from  primary fragments. 12.26.4.  Table 12.2.  provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.2.1 and 1.2.2. 12.26.4.1.  HD 1.2.1 IBD in the open is given in Table 12.9.  When HD 1.2.1 items are stored in structures that may contribute to the debris hazard, the IBD is determined by using the larger of the following two distances:  either that given in Table 12.9. for the appropriate Explosive Weight (number of items x NEWQD) or that given in Table 12.10. for the appropriate MCE. Note:  Hazardous debris distance (HDD) specified in Table 12.10. equates to IBD. 12.26.4.2.  HD 1.2.2 IBD is given in Table 12.11. 12.26.4.3.  PTRD  given  in  Tables  12.9.  through    12.11.  give  consideration  to  the transient nature of the exposure in the same manner as for HD 1.1.  PTRD is computed as 60 percent of the IBD for items in this HD, with minimum distances specified in Table 12.2. 218 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.26.4.4.  ILD given in Tables 12.9. through  12.11. take into account the progressive nature of explosions involving these items (normally resulting from fire spread), up to the magnitude  of  the  MCE,  and  the  ability  to  evacuate  personnel  from  endangered  areas before  the  progression  involves  large  numbers  of  items.    Exposed  structures  may  be extensively damaged by projections and propagation of explosions may occur due to the ignition of combustibles by projections.  ILD is computed as 36 percent of the IBD for items of this HD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD given in Table 12.2. for the applicable PES-ES combination. 12.26.4.5.  IMD given in Table 12.2. are dependent upon the types of structures acting as both the PES and the ES. 12.27.  HD  1.2.3 QD Criteria. 12.27.1.  When  siting  HD  1.2.3,  cap  the  NEWQD  of  the  largest  single  round  at  <  450 pounds, and cap the parenthetical fragment distance (xx) at 1300 feet.  These caps are for simplicity in siting and may be exceeded with AFSEC/SEW approval. 12.27.2.  Table 12.2.  provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.2.3. 12.27.2.1.  The IBD for HD 1.2.3 is determined using Table 12.12. (HD 1.3 QD) for the NEWQD of the HD 1.2.3 item multiplied by the number of rounds present, but with a minimum IBD determined as follows: 12.27.2.1.1.  If the items are in a heavy structure that can interrupt primary fragments and can contribute secondary debris (including side/rear exposures from ECMs), the minimum  IBD is the hazardous debris distance  given in Table 12.10. for an  MCE equal to the NEWQD of the largest single round.  A heavy structure is defined as a structure with wall thickness >12 inches of reinforced concrete and a roof thickness >5.9 inches of reinforced concrete. 12.27.2.1.2.  If  the  items  are  in  the  open  or  in  a  structure  that  can  not  interrupt primary  fragments,  the  minimum  IBD  applied  is  the  greatest  parenthetical  (xx) fragment distance assigned to the HD 1.2.3 item to be stored. 12.27.2.1.3.  As  an  alternative  to  the  criteria  in  paragraphs  12.27.2.1.1.  and  12.27.2.1.2., when an increase in the allowable quantity or a reduction in the required distance will result, HD 1.2.3 AE may be treated as follows: 12.27.2.1.3.1.  If the largest single round NEWQD is > 1.6 lbs, consider the items as HD 1.2.1.  Use the total NEWQD present, with an MCE equal to the NEWQD of the largest single round to determine the maximum QD. 12.27.2.1.3.2.  If the largest single round NEWQD is < than 1.6 lbs, consider the items as HD 1.2.2, based on the total NEWQD present. 12.27.2.2.  PTR  and  IL  for  HD  1.2.3  are  computed  as  60  percent  and  36  percent, respectively,  of  the  determined  IBD  with  a  minimum  distance  equal  to  IMD  given  in Table 12.2. Section 12J—HD  1.3 QD Criteria 12.28.  HD  1.3 QD Criteria. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 219 12.28.1.  Table 12.3.  provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.3.  Table 12.12. provides QD criteria for HD 1.3. 12.28.2.  HD  1.3  includes  items  that  burn  vigorously  with  little  or  no  possibility  of extinguishment in storage situations. 12.28.3.  Explosions  are  normally  confined  to  pressure  ruptures  of  containers  and  will  not produce  propagating  shock  waves  or  damaging  blast  overpressure  beyond  the  magazine distance specified in Table 12.12. 12.28.4.  A severe fire hazard may result from tossing about of burning container materials, propellant, or other flaming debris. Section 12K—HD  1.4 QD Criteria 12.29.  HD  1.4 QD Criteria. 12.29.1.  Table 12.3.  provides a summary matrix of all the paired relationships for HD 1.4.  Table  12.13.  provides  QD  criteria  for  HD  1.4.    HD  1.4  AE  presents  a  fire  hazard  with minimal blast, fragmentation, or toxic hazards. 12.29.2.  In mixed storage, the NEWQD of HD 1.4 is not additive (see paragraph 12.7.1.1.).  Determine QD criteria for each HD present, including HD 1.4, and use the largest value. 12.29.3.  HD 1.4S AE may be stored (including associated handling) without regard to the QD criteria in Table 12.13 (see paragraph 2.23.). Section 12L—HD  1.6 QD Criteria 12.30.  HD    1.6  QD  Criteria.  Table  12.3.  provides  a  summary  matrix  of  all  the  paired relationships for HD 1.6.  Table 12.14. provides QD criteria for HD 1.6.  Base QD separations for HD 1.6 AE on the storage location and configuration.  Only permit a maximum of 500,000 lbs NEWQD at any one location.  Any special storage configuration and siting approved for HD 1.1 AE may be used for storage of like explosive weights of HD 1.6 AE. Section 12M—HD  6.1 Criteria 12.31.  HD  6.1 Criteria. 12.31.1.  HD 6.1 includes items that contain only toxic chemical or riot control agents.  AE containing both explosives and toxic chemical or riot control agents may be hazard classified as HD 1.1 through HD 1.4, based on testing IAW 49 CFR Parts 171 to 177. 12.31.2.  Hazard zones for toxic chemical agents are determined by the relative toxicity of the  agents,  the  amount  released  to  the  atmosphere,  the  rate  they  are  released  (that  is, evaporation, pressure, or explosive dispersal), terrain features, and meteorological conditions.  Hazard  zone  calculations  are  based  on  MCE,  using  DDESB  TP  10,  Methodology  for Chemical Hazard Prediction. 12.31.3.  When siting AE containing toxic chemical agents, evaluate both the explosives and toxic chemical agent hazards with the greatest QD governing siting. 220 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Section 12N—Energetic Liquids QD Criteria 12.32.  Scope and Application. 12.32.1.  This section applies to the storage of energetic liquids, listed in Table 12.15., in all types  of  containers,  including  rocket  and  missile  tankage.    Store  and  handle  laboratory quantities as prescribed in Chapter 5 of AFI 91-203. Note:  The required QD are only based on the energetic liquids’ energetic reaction–that is, blast overpressure and container fragmentation.  These QD requirements do not consider the toxicity or potential down-wind hazard.  Therefore, QD may not be the only factor that needs to be considered when selecting a location for storage and operations of energetic liquids. 12.32.2.  Exclusion.  This section does not govern the storage or handling of energetic liquids for uses other than in space launch vehicles, rockets, missiles, associated static test apparatus, and AE. 12.33.  Concept. 12.33.1.  These QD standards were developed on the premise that construction materials are compatible  with  energetic  liquids,  facilities  are  of  appropriate  design,  fire  protection  and drainage  control  techniques  are  employed,  and  other  specialized  controls  (e.g.,  nitrogen padding, blanketing, and tank cooling) are used, when required. 12.33.2.  When  additional  hazards  associated  with  AE  are  involved,  apply  the  safety distances prescribed in other sections of this standard. 12.33.3.  These  standards  are  based  upon  the  estimated  credible  damage  resulting  from  an incident, without considering probabilities or frequency of occurrence. 12.34.  Determination of Energetic Liquids Quantity. 12.34.1.  The total quantity of energetic liquids in a tank, drum, cylinder, or other container will  be  the  net  weight  of  the  energetic  liquids  contained  therein.    Include  the  quantity  of energetic  liquids  in  the  associated  piping  to  the  points  that  provide  positive  means  for interrupting the flow through the pipe, or interrupting a reaction in the pipe in the event of an incident. 12.34.2.  When the quantities of energetic liquids are given in gallons, the conversion factors given in Table 12.16. may be used to determine the quantity in pounds. 12.35.  Measurement of Separation Distances. 12.35.1.  Measure  from  the  closest  controlling  hazard  source  (e.g.,  containers,  buildings, segment, or positive cutoff point in piping). 12.35.2.  Measure  from  the  nearest  container  or  controlling  sub-division,  when  buildings containing a small number of cylinders or drums are present or when quantities of energetic liquids are subdivided effectively. 12.36.  Hazard Classification of Energetic Liquids. 12.36.1.  The main UN  hazard classification designators  for  energetic liquids are indicated below. 12.36.1.1.  Class 1:  Explosives. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 221 12.36.1.2.  Class 2:  Gases. 12.36.1.3.  Class 3:  Flammable liquids. 12.36.1.4.  Class 4:  Flammable solids. 12.36.1.5.  Class 5:  Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides. 12.36.1.6.  Class 6:  Toxic and infectious substances. 12.36.1.7.  Class 8:  Corrosive substances. 12.36.1.8.  Class 9:  Miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles. Note:  The original liquid propellant Hazard Groups I - IV and CG A - F are no longer used.  12.36.2.  Because two energetic liquids might each be compatible with certain explosive AE stores,  but  incompatible  with  each  other,  a  two-part  compatibility  group  designation  is assigned to an energetic liquid.  Another example is the storage of liquid gun propellant with explosive AE components. Note:  The design and logistics of modern weapons sometimes require that consideration be given to permitting storage or operations involving energetic liquids in a storage structure containing solid explosives (e.g., it may be necessary to store hydrocarbon-fueled cruise missiles having HE warheads with fueled configurations not containing explosive warheads. 12.36.2.1.  The first element is the standard storage and transportation CG designation.  The alpha designations are the same as the CG designations for UN Class 1 as given in Chapter  3.    However,  for  storage  and  handling  on  DoD  facilities,  a  CG  may  also  be assigned  to  an  energetic  liquid  in  a  Class  other  than  Class  1.    The  absence  of  a  CG indicates incompatibility with solid explosives. 12.36.2.2.  The second element is a new Energetic Liquid Compatibility Group (ELCG) designation.  The ELCG applies to mixed storage of energetic liquids or AE containing energetic liquids.  The ELCG is specified in parentheses as the last element of the hazard classification.  The ELCG designations and definitions are: 12.36.2.2.1.  LA:    Energetic  liquids  that  are  strong  oxidizers,  mainly  of  acidic character.    These  materials  may  cause  or  contribute  to  the  combustion  of  other material, possibly resulting in serious flare fires or explosions.  Includes, but is not limited  to,  nitrogen  tetroxide  and  mixed  oxides  of  nitrogen  (MON),  inhibited  red fuming  nitric  acid  (IRFNA),  liquid  oxygen  (LO2),  hydrogen  peroxide  (H2O2),  and gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above. 12.36.2.2.2.  LB:  Energetic liquids that are readily combustible when exposed to, or ignited in the presence of an oxidizing agent, but that are not strong reducing agents.  Some may be hypergolic with group LA materials.  Includes, but is not limited to, hydrocarbons  such  as  kerosene’s  and  strained  ring  ramjet  fuels;  liquid  hydrogen (LH2); and gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above. 12.36.2.2.3.  LC:  Energetic liquids that are readily combustible when exposed to, or ignited  in  the  presence  of  an  oxidizing  agent,  and  are  also  strong  reducing  agents.  These  are  likely  to  be  hypergolic  with  group  LA  substances.    Includes,  but  is  not limited to, hydrazine’s and other amines; and gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above. 222 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.36.2.2.4.  LD:  Energetic liquids that act mainly as combustible fuels, similar to groups LB and LC, when exposed to, or ignited in the presence of oxidizing agents but that may act as oxidizers in some combinations.  They may be a monopropellant with  the  right  catalyst,  or  may  be  pyrophoric  and  ignite  upon  release  to  the atmosphere (e.g., ethylene and propylene oxides, and boranes). 12.36.2.2.5.  LE:  Energetic liquids having characteristics that do not permit storage with any other energetic liquid.  They may react adversely with either fuels (reducing agents) or oxidizers (e.g., nitromethane, nitrate ester based formulations such as Otto Fuel  II,  liquid  monopropellants  containing  hydroxyl  ammonium  nitrate  (HAN), halogen fluorides (ClF3 and ClF5) and fluorine, and gels, slurries, or emulsions of the above). 12.36.2.3.  Mixing of energetic liquids. 12.36.2.3.1.  Different energetic liquids in the same ELCG may be stored together. 12.36.2.3.2.  ELCG-LE may not be mixed with other ELCG or dissimilar ELCG-LE. 12.36.2.3.3.  Mixed storage is prohibited between energetic liquids of different ELCG designations  with  one  exception.    ELCG-LB  and  -LC  must  not  be  stored  together, particularly when the majority of the material stored is ELCG-LB; however, mixed storage of ELCG-LB and -LC is permitted when operationally necessary. 12.36.2.4.  As an example, for the 1.3C (LE) hazard classification for HAN-based liquid gun propellant XM-46: 12.36.2.4.1.  "C": indicates the propellant can be stored in the same magazine with CG-C  solid  propellants.    Because  CG-C  and  CG-D  can  be  mixed,  CG-D  HE projectiles could also be stored with the energetic liquid gun propellant. 12.36.2.4.2.  "LE":  indicates  that  hydrocarbon  fuels  (e.g.,  JP-10),  an  ELCG-LB, would  not  be  permitted  in  this  storage  scenario,  because  its  ELCG-LB  indicates incompatibility with ELCG-LE. 12.36.3.  Complete  DoD  hazard  classification  assignments  for  current  energetic  liquids  are shown in Table 12.15. Note:  Conversions of energetic liquids from gallons to pounds is provided in Table 12.16. 12.36.4.  Examine each new energetic liquid, or new non-bulk packaging configuration of an energetic liquid, developed or adopted for DoD use, and assign a hazard classification per Technical Bulletin 700-2, Naval Sea Systems Command Instruction 8020.8B, TO 11A-1-47, Defense  Logistics  Agency  Regulations  8220.1,  and  DoD  Ammunitions  and  Explosives Hazard  Classification  Procedures.    The  MAJCOM  developing  a  liquid  propellant  (or  first adopting  for  use  any  liquid  propellant  not  listed  here)  must  recommend  the  hazard classification and compatibility group designation.  The responsible MAJCOM will forward substantiated proposals for such assignments as soon as systems application planning allows or warrants to AFSEC/SEW. 12.36.5.  A  different  minimum  distance  may  be  assigned  during  the  hazard  classification process  when  the  hazards  of  a  particular  new  packaging  configuration  are  not  adequately addressed.  This distance will be indicated parenthetically, in hundreds of feet, as the first AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 223 element  of  the  hazard  classification  (e.g.,  if  a  new  liquid  oxidizer  pressure  vessel configuration  is  hazard  classified  as  (04)  2.2  (LA),  then  a  minimum  distance  of  400  feet would apply for IBD and PTRD, otherwise the prescribed liquid oxidizer QD criteria would apply). 12.36.6.  Specific Hazardous Locations.  The predominant hazard of the individual energetic liquids at specific hazardous locations can vary depending upon the location of the energetic liquid storage and the operations involved.  These locations are listed below in the order of decreasing hazards. 12.36.6.1.  Launch Pads.  Operations at these facilities are very hazardous because of the proximity of fuel and oxidizer to each other, the frequency of launchings, lack of restraint of the vehicle after liftoff, and the possibility of fallback with resultant dynamic mixing on impact.  To compute the explosive equivalent for the launch pad, use Table 12.17. with the combined energetic liquids weight in the launch vehicle tanks and any energetic liquids in piping that are subject to mixing, except as indicated in paragraph 12.36.8. 12.36.6.2.  Static Test Stands.  Operations at these facilities are less hazardous because test  items  are  restrained  and  subject  to  better  control  than  launch  vehicles.    As  with launch pads, the proximity of fuel and oxidizer presents a significant hazard.  To reduce this  hazard,  separate  tankage  and  remotely  locate  it  from  the  static  test  stand.    Use explosive equivalents of Table 12.17. with the combined energetic liquids weight subject to mixing as determined by hazard analysis.  The amount of energetic liquids held in run tanks can be excluded from consideration if the test stand meets all the following criteria, if applicable: 12.36.6.2.1.  All  tanks  are  American  Society  of  Mechanical  Engineers  (ASME) certified  IAW    Wilton,  C.,  “Investigation  of  the  Explosive  Potential  of  the  Hybrid Propellant  Combinations  N2O4/PBAN  and  CTF/PBAN,”  AFRPL-TR-67-124,  1967 and maintained per ASME Code, section VIII, division 1 or division 2. 12.36.6.2.2.  For  cryogenic  propellants,  all  tanks  are  constructed  with  double  wall jacketing. 12.36.6.2.3.  Run  tankage  is  protected  from  fragments  produced  by  an  engine malfunction. 12.36.6.2.4.  Both  the  fuel  and  oxidizer  lines  contain  two  (redundant),  remotely operated valves to shut off flow in the event of a malfunction. 12.36.7.  Ready Storage.  This storage is relatively close to the launch and static test stands; normally it is not involved directly in feeding the engine as in the case with run tankage, an integral part of all launch and test stand operations.  Use the explosive equivalents of Table 12.17.  with  the  combined  energetic  liquids  weight  subject  to  mixing  if  the  facility  design does not guarantee against fuel and oxidizer mixing and against detonation propagation to, or initiation at, the ready storage facility when a mishap occurs at the test stand, on the ground at the launch pad, or at the ready storage areas.  Otherwise, fire and fragment hazards will govern (See Tables 12.15.,  12.18.,  12.19.,  12.20., and  12.21.). 12.36.8.  Cold-Flow  Test  Operations.    Fire  and  fragment  hazards  govern  (Tables  12.15.,  12.18.,  12.19.,  12.20., and  12.21.) if the design is such that the system is closed except for 224 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 approved venting, is completely airtight, fuel and oxidizer never are employed concurrently, and each has a completely separate isolated system and fitting types to preclude intermixing, and the energetic liquids are of required purity.  Otherwise, use explosive equivalents with the combined energetic liquids weight (see Table 12.17.). 12.36.9.  Bulk  Storage.    This  is  the  most  remote  storage  with  respect  to  launch  and  test operations.  It consists of the area, tanks, and other containers therein, used to hold energetic liquids  for  supplying  ready  storage  and,  indirectly,  run  tankage  where  no  ready  storage  is available.  Fire and fragment hazards govern storage requirements except in special cases as indicated  in  Tables  12.15.  and    12.17.  (see  Tables  12.15.,    12.18.,    12.19.,    12.20.,  and  12.21.). 12.36.10.  Rest  Storage.    This  is  temporary-type  storage  and  most  closely  resembles  bulk storage.  It is a temporary parking location for barges, trailers, tank cars, and portable hold tanks used for topping operations when these units actually are not engaged in the operation; and for such vehicles when they are unable to empty their cargo promptly into the intended storage container.  Fire and fragment hazards governstorage requirements except in special cases as indicated in Tables 12.15. and  12.17. (see Tables 12.15.,  12.18.,  12.19.,  12.20., and  12.21.).  The transporter becomes a part of that storage where it is connected during energetic liquids transfer. 12.36.11.  Run Tankage (Operating Tankage).  This consists of the tank and other containers and associated piping used to hold the energetic liquids for direct feeding into the engine or device during operation.  The contents of properly separated "run tanks" (operating tankage) and  piping  are  normally  considered  on  the  basis  of  the  pertinent  hazards  for  the  materials involved, except for quantities of incompatible materials that are or can be in a position to become mixed.  Use explosive equivalents for quantities of such materials subject to mixing unless  satisfying  provisions  of  paragraphs  12.36.6.2.1.  through    12.36.6.2.4.  (see  Table 12.17.). 12.36.12.  Pipelines.  Maintain a 25-ft clear zone to inhabited buildings, as a minimum, on each side of pipelines used for energetic liquids (excluding flammable or combustible liquids that  exhibit  normal  fire  hazards  such  as  RP-1,  JP-10,  and  Otto  Fuel  II).    Tables  12.15.,  12.19.,  12.20., and  12.21. apply, as appropriate. 12.37.  QD  Standards.  Since  many  energetic  liquids  are  not  classified  as  UN  Class  1 explosives, conventional QD storage criteria do not generally apply to these materials.  At the same time, the (non-Class 1) UN transportation hazard classifications for many energetic liquids appear  to  be  inappropriate  or  inadequate  for  application  to  storage  safety  (based  on  available accident and test data) (e.g., hydrazine has a UN hazard classification of 8 (corrosive), while it also  is  subject  to  dangerous  fire  and  explosive  behavior).    Thus,  the  implementation  of  QD criteria for energetic liquids is based on an independent determination of the predominant hazard presented by the material in the storage environment.  The following standards are applicable to energetic liquids used for propulsion or operation of missiles, rockets, and other related devices. 12.37.1.  Tables  12.15.,    12.18.,    12.19.,    12.20.,  and    12.21.  provide  minimum  distance requirements  for  storage  of  bulk  quantities,  and  in  some  cases,  pressure  vessels  and  other commercial  packaging  of  energetic  liquids.    In  general,  the  energetic  liquid  materials requiring the greatest distance determine the minimum separation to other energetic liquids.  In addition, take positive measures to control the flow of energetic liquids in the event of a AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 225 leak  or  spill,  in  order  to  prevent  possible  fire  propagation  or  accumulation  of  flammable liquids near other storage, and to prevent mixing of incompatible energetic liquids (except for specific  hazardous  locations  as  identified  in  paragraph  12.36.6.  above).    Explosives equivalence applies for some materials as indicated in Tables 12.15. and  12.17.  Fragment hazards  govern  for  some  materials  in  certain  packaging  configurations.    For  the  more conventional fuels and oxidizers, and also where minimum blast and fragment criteria are not required  due  to  low  confinement  packaging,  QD  standards  are  adopted  from  OSHA  and NFPA guidelines to account for normal fire protection principles. 12.37.2.  For  specific  hazardous  locations  as  defined  in  paragraph  12.36.6.  above, explosives  equivalency  may  apply.    If  so,  consult  Tables  12.15.  and    12.17.  with  the combined energetic liquids weight subject to mixing and use distances found in Table 12.6. or    12.8.    Enter  weight  of  explosives  equivalent  in  Table  12.6.  or    12.8.    AFSEC/SEW determines QD standards for other conditions and explosive equivalents for any combination not contained in Table 12.15. or  12.17. 12.38.  Contaminated Energetic Liquids. 12.38.1.  Exercise  caution  in  the  storage  and  handling  of  contaminated  energetic  liquids.  Such contamination may increase the degree of hazard associated with the energetic liquids. 12.38.2.  Isolate  energetic  liquids  known  to  be  contaminated  or  in  a  suspect  condition  and provide  separate  storage  from  all  other  energetic  liquids  pending  laboratory  analysis  for verification of contamination and disposition requirements, if any. Section 12O—QD Criteria Specific Facilities and Systems 12.39.  General Airfield Criteria. 12.39.1.  Airfield  Criteria.    Reference  Unified  Facilities  Criteria  3-260-01,  Airfield  and Heliport  Planning  and  Design  and  AFH  32-1084,  Facility  Requirements  for  minimum airfield  criteria  for  parked  explosives-loaded  aircraft.    If  airfield  criteria  deviations  are required, address the status of the deviations in the ESP transmittal letter. (T-1). 12.39.2.  Forward  Firing Munitions.  Weapon systems such as  guns, rockets, missiles, and flare dispensers pose an additional hazard (beyond their explosives hazard) because of their directional response and potential long range if inadvertently activated on the ground.  QD requirements do not address this additional hazard.  Comply with the following to minimize this additional hazard: 12.39.2.1.  Position aircraft to present the minimum hazard to personnel and resources in the event of a mishap. 12.39.2.2.  Do  not  unnecessarily  stand  or  park  vehicles  in  front  of,  or  behind,  these munitions when power is applied to the aircraft. 12.39.2.3.  Comply  with  AFI  91-101,  Air  Force  Nuclear  Weapons  Surety  Program  for PNAF missions. 12.39.3.  AE Prohibited Areas.  Areas immediately beyond the ends of runways and along primary flight paths are subject to more aircraft accidents than other areas.  For this reason, AE is prohibited from Accident Potential Zones (APZ) I and II and clear zones (CZ) of all 226 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 aircraft landing facilities as depicted and described in UFC 3-260-01, Airfield and Heliport Planning  and  Design  and  defined  by  the  MAJCOM’s.    Accomplish  deviations  to  AE prohibited areas through risk acceptance documentation according to paragraph 1.4.  ESP submittals  must  reference  the  approved  airfield  waiver  as  supporting  justification  for  the deviation. (T-1). 12.39.4.  Munitions Loading Operations.  Conduct uploading and downloading of munitions at sited explosives-loaded aircraft parking areas (see paragraph 12.47.). 12.40.  Combat Aircraft Related Activities. 12.40.1.  All facilities and functions directly involved in maintaining, servicing, controlling, and  flying  combat  aircraft  are  considered  related  to  AE  on  the  flightline  supporting  those combat  aircraft  and  may  be  sited  at  ILD  from  such  AE  (subject  to  minimum  separation distances  from  HASs  as  specified  in  paragraph  12.50.13.  and  to  guidance  given  in paragraph 12.40.5.).  The primary test to be applied in determining combat aircraft related facilities  is  that  the  function  provides  essential  daily  and  direct  support  for  the  PES presenting the hazard.  Examples of facilities and functions generally considered related to combat aircraft generation include: 12.40.1.1.  Facilities that handle AE on the flightline, prepare and service armed aircraft, and those that house personnel who fly combat aircraft (e.g., alert crew shelters). 12.40.1.2.  Direct flightline combat aircraft associated facilities, which may contain field offices, break rooms, unit training rooms, and equipment and supply rooms. 12.40.1.3.  Maintenance Group and Operations Group functions. 12.40.1.4.  POL or LOX servicing facilities, including hot pit refueling areas. 12.40.1.5.  Civil  engineering  functions  solely  dedicated  to  maintaining  the  runway  and taxiways. 12.40.1.6.  Forward supply points. 12.40.1.7.  Intelligence, debriefing, and flightline security functions. 12.40.2.  Because combat aircraft generation cannot progress without their combined efforts, combat  aircraft  support  functions  and  facilities  involving  explosives  may  be  considered related  to  each  other,  if  they  are  considered  related  to  the  combat  aircraft.    Therefore,  all explosives  support  functions  and  facilities  deemed  related  to  combat  aircraft  generation activities  on  the  flightline  may  be  located  at  ILD  from  one  another  (subject  to  minimum separation distances from HASs as specified in paragraph 12.50.13.). 12.40.3.  Separate combat aircraft related facilities from any PES they are not related to by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance.  If combat aircraft related facilities are located in a HAS, this separation from unrelated PESs may be reduced to K30 to the frontal cone and K9 or K18 to the sides or rear.  Site some hardened facilities at lesser distances if equivalent protection is demonstrated by test or analysis and approved by AFSEC/SEW. 12.40.4.  Separate  other  flightline  facilities  or  activities  not  directly  supportting  combat aircraft generation by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance, from combat aircraft and their related explosives operations. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 227 12.40.5.  Typical MSA explosives operations located on the flightline (e.g., bomb build-up) may be considered related to combat aircraft, but are not necessarily related to other combat aircraft related facilities or flightline support functions (e.g., wheel and tire shop). 12.40.6.  Flightline Dining Facilities.  Provide IBD with a minimum fragment distance from all  PES  locations  when  access  to  the  dining  facility  is  available  to  personnel  who  do  not directly support flightline activities.  Provide IBD with no minimum fragment distance from an MSA PES location provided the dining facility is used exclusively by flightline personnel.  Provide ILD from flightline PES locations when the dining facility is only used by personnel who directly support flightline activities. 12.41.  Explosives Cargo Aircraft Related Activities. 12.41.1.  Consider flightline personnel who solely support explosives cargo aircraft and all munitions  maintenance  activities  related  to  explosives  cargo  and  explosives  cargo  aircraft.  These personnel may be separated at ILD from such AE. 12.41.2.  Explosives cargo aircraft support functions and facilities involving explosives may be considered related to each other, if they are consider related to explosives cargo aircraft.  Therefore, all explosives support functions and facilities deemed related to explosives cargo aircraft activities on the flightline may be located at ILD from one another. 12.41.3.  Separate  explosives  cargo  aircraft  related  facilities  from  any  PES  they  are  not related to by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance. 12.41.4.  Separate  other  flightline  facilities  or  activities  not  directly  supporting  explosives cargo aircraft operations and maintenance by IBD, with no minimum fragment distance, from explosives cargo aircraft. 12.41.5.  Typical  MSA  explosives  operations  located  on  the  flightline  may  be  considered related to explosives cargo aircraft, but are not necessarily related to other explosives cargo aircraft related facilities or flightline support functions. 12.42.  Munitions or Weapons Storage Area Related Activities. 12.42.1.  Activities  directly  associated  with  munitions  storage  or  munitions  operations  are considered related to MSA AE and may be separated at ILD from such AE. 12.42.2.  Munitions support functions and facilities involving explosives may be considered related  to  each  other  (regardless  of  owning  service,  organization  or  country),  if  they  are related to MSA AE. 12.42.3.  Separate MSA-related facilities from any PES they are not related to by IBD, with no  minimum  fragment  distance  (e.g.,  the  MSA  office  from  a  combat  aircraft  parking  area (CAPA)).  However, explosives operating locations may be protected by ILD from combat aircraft. 12.43.  Concurrent Servicing Operations (CSO).  CSO using live munitions will be conducted in sited CAPA locations.  Identify inert CSO locations as ESs when they are located within a clear zone. 12.44.  Hot-Pit Refueling Operations.  All aircraft undergoing hot-pit refueling are considered to be in transportation mode and are exempt from QD criteria as a PES.  Evaluate the hot-pit refueling area and associated aircraft as an ES; apply the greater separation treating the location 228 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 as a military use only taxiway or separation required for the POL.  See paragraph 12.79. for QD requirements for the POL facilities associated with the hot-pit refueling area. 12.45.  End-of-Runway  (EOR)  and  Arm/de-Arm  Pads  and  Crew  Shelters.  All  aircraft undergoing EOR or arm/de-arm operations are considered to be in transportation mode and are exempt from QD criteria as a PES. As an ES, treat as a military use only taxiway.  Site EOR and arm/de-arm crew shelters as military use only runways per Tables 12.1.,  12.2., and  12.3.  If these shelters are used as office areas for arm/de-arm crews, site these exposures at IBD, with no minimum fragment distance, from MSA, PESs, and ILD from flightline PESs. 12.46.  Aircraft  NEWQD.  Exclude  the  following  AE  when  determining  the  NEWQD  of explosives loaded aircraft:  AE installed on aircraft (e.g., egress system components, squibs, and detonators  for  jettisoning  external  stores,  enginestarter  cartridges,  fire  extinguisher  cartridges, and  destructors  in  electronic  equipment),  contained  in  survival  and  rescue  kits  (e.g.,  flares, signals,  explosives  components  of  emergency  equipment),  and  other  such  items  or  materials necessary for safe flight operations. 12.47.  Explosives Aircraft Exempt from Siting as a PES.  Aircraft configured with the items listed below are exempt from QD site planning requirements when evaluated as a PES; site these locations  as  ESs.    This  does  not  include  AE  carried  as  cargo.    Park  in  a  designated  aircraft parking  area  meeting  airfield  criteria  and  treat  the  aircraft  as  explosives-loaded  in  all  other respects.  The following munitions can be uploaded and downloaded at the designated aircraft parking  area  provided  that  the  quantity  of  munitions  being  loaded  or  unloaded  is  limited to  a single aircraft load.  Munitions delivery trailers (i.e., UALS, BDU, flare & chaff mods, captive-carry missiles) are considered in the transportation mode (QD-exempt) provided the trailers do not remain at the designated aircraft parking area longer than the loading or unloading operation being conducted. 12.47.1.  HD 1.2.2 gun ammunition, 30 mm or less. 12.47.2.  HD  1.3  installed  aircraft  defensive  flares.    Externally  loaded  munitions  such  as LUU-1/2 flares and 2.75” training rockets require QD. 12.47.3.  HD 1.4 munitions (e.g., chaff squibs, captive-carry training missiles, BDU-33s). 12.47.4.  Installed explosives necessary for safe flight operations per paragraph 12.46.  See glossary and TO 11A-1-33 for further information. 12.48.  Other Aircraft Configurations. 12.48.1.  For  F-15  and  F-16  aircraft  in  the  open  with  AIM/Air-to-Ground  (AGM)  series missile configurations as shown in Figures 12.4. and  12.5. use Table 12.1. to determine the type  of  QD  separation  required  for  exposed  sites  and  use  Figures  12.4.  and    12.5.  to determine  the  actual  QD  separation  distances.    For  aircraft  in  a  structure,  apply  building debris criteria  IAW paragraph 12.23.1.5.  or  12.23.1.6.  Exception:  Aircraft in fabric or tubular shelters or light metal structures (e.g., butler building), apply the criteria above for aircraft in the open.  Other aircraft configurations with mixed missile loads may be requested through MAJCOM/SEW. Note:  These distances are not reduced QD separations; they are only provided to simplify determination of required QD separations for standard aircraft configurations. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 229 12.48.2.  Internally loaded aircraft, e.g., F-35 and F-22, produce secondary debris; therefore, building debris criteria must be considered unless otherwise specified. 12.49.  Reduced MCEs for F-15, F-16 and F-22Aircraft with AIM Series Missiles.  Testing and analysis have demonstrated an allowable reduction in MCE and QD for some F-15 and F-16 configurations.  Use of these reductions is only allowed if no single trailer servicing the aircraft would present an MCE greater than the MCE used to generate the  aircraft QD arcs.   In most cases, this means that the trailer cannot be loaded with more than the MCE of missiles.  Where test results permit, such as in the case of a single layer of AIM-120 missiles loaded in alternating directions on a single trailer, reduced trailer MCEs may be applied.  In that specific case, the trailer MCE is a single AIM-120 missile.  For F-15 and F-16 aircraft in the open with AIM series missile configurations as shown in Figures 12.6. and  12.7. use Table 12.1. to determine the type of  QD  separation  required  for  exposed  sites  and  use  the  following  to  determine  actual  QD separation distances: (T-1). 12.49.1.  For F-15 aircraft in the open see Figure 12.6. 12.49.2.  For F-16 aircraft in the open see Figure 12.7. 12.49.3.  For F-22 aircraft in the open with AIM series missile configurations use Table 12.1. to determine the type of QD separation required for exposed sites and use the following to determine actual QD separations distances: 12.49.3.1.  Configuration 1, four AIM-120s and two AIM-9s.  NEWQD for MCE is 19.0 lbs.  The HFD/IBD is 400 feet, PTR is 240 feet, ILD is 48 feet, and IMD is 10 feet.  The AIM-9s will always be on stations 3/10 and the AIM-120s can be on stations 4/5 and 8/9 or 5/6 and 7/8. 12.49.3.2.  Configuration 2, six AIM-120s and two AIM-9s.  NEWQD for MCE is 19.0 lbs.  The HFD/IBD is 400 feet, PTR is 240 feet, ILD is 48 feet, and IMD is 10 feet.  The AIM-9s will always be on stations 3/10 and the AIM-120s on stations 4/5/6 and 7/8/9. 12.49.3.3.  Configuration 3, two AIM-120s and two AIM 9s. Note:  AIM-120s must be AIM-120, Weapon Delivery Unit (WDU)-33/Bs and/or AIM-120, WDU-41/Bs.  AIM-9s must be AIM-9L, WDU-17s, and/or AIM-9M, WDU-17s and/or AIM-9Xs. 12.49.4.  For F-15, F-16 and F-22 aircraft in fabric or tubular shelters or light metal structures (e.g., butler building), apply the criteria above for aircraft in the open. (T-1). 12.49.5.  For  any  other  type  of  structure,  building  debris  criteria  must  be  considered  IAW paragraph 12.23.1.5. or  12.23.1.6. (T-1). 12.50.  Hardened Aircraft Shelters (HAS) and Associated AE Facilities. 12.50.1.  All HAS, except Korean TAB VEE HAS fronts and Korean Flow-Through HAS fronts  and  rears,  are  structures  capable  of  stopping  primary  fragments  when  doors  are properly secured.  HD 1.1 and HD 1.2.3 parenthetical (xx) fragment distances do not apply except  out  the  front  of  a  Korean  TAB  VEE  and  out  the  front  or  rear  of  a  Korean  Flow-Through HAS. 12.50.2.  Separate HAS according to Table 12.23. to provide IMD (or equivalent) protection.  (T-1).  For First, Second, and Third Generation HAS, and Korean TAB VEE Modified (with 230 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 hardened front closure) HAS, these distances also provide a high degree of protection against propagation  of  explosion  when  HAS  doors  are  properly  secured.    However,  the  exposed shelter may be damaged heavily and aircraft and AE within may be rendered unserviceable.  For  Korean  TAB  VEE  HAS  front,  and  Korean  Flow-Through  HAS  front  or  rear  (due  to openings) at these distances there may be serious damage to aircraft and possible propagation of detonation due to fragments, debris, or fire. 12.50.3.  HAS separated according to Table 12.24. (and with HAS doors properly secured) are  provided  a  higher  degree  of  asset  preservation  (K30  or  equivalent  overpressure)  than those provided in Table 12.23.  An explosion in one shelter or ready storage facility may destroy  it  and  its  contents,  but  aircraft  within  adjacent  shelters  should  be  undamaged provided  the  doors  are  closed.    These  aircraft  may  not  be  immediately  accessible  due  to debris. 12.50.4.  Table  12.23.  and  Table  12.24.  criteria  are  based  on  First,  Second,  and  Third Generation HAS doors remaining closed, except for: 12.50.4.1.  Aircraft  towing,  fueling,  servicing,  run  up,  taxi  and  other  maintenance activities requiring temporary periods when HAS doors must be opened  IAW AFI 21-101, Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management. 12.50.4.2.  During CSO or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters.  If doors are left open for extended periods, apply the following criteria: (T-1). 12.50.4.2.1.  For prevention of simultaneous detonation, apply default IMD to or from an open front.  No reduction from K11 is allowed between “open door” HAS front-to-front exposures. 12.50.4.2.2.  For aircraft survivability apply Table 12.22. to or from an open front. 12.50.5.  First Generation and Korean TAB VEE HASs are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 5,863 lbs.  Second Generation, Third Generation, and Korean  Flow-Through HASs  are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 11,000 lbs.  Flow-Through HAS Pairs are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 4,800 lbs in each HAS.  HAS Pairs with rear walls or with front and rear  walls  are  limited  to  a  maximum  NEWQD  of  2,390  lbs  in  each  HAS.    HAS  Ready Service ECMs/AGMs are limited to a maximum NEWQD of 22,000 lbs. Note:  W/WS3 HASs are limited to 10,000 lbs IAW AFI 91-112, Safety Rules for US/NATO Strike Fighters.   12.50.6.  Use  separation  distances  of  Table  12.25.  for  separation  of  unhardened  ES  from Third  Generation  HASs,  provided  the  NEWQD  limitation  of  paragraph  12.50.5.  (T-1).  Lesser distances may be permitted to hardened ES that provide equivalent protection, when approved by DDESB. 12.50.7.  Apply Table 12.25. for separation of unhardened ES from Second Generation and Korean  Flow-Through  HASs  as  follows,  provided  the  NEWQD  limitations  of  paragraph 12.50.5. are met: (T-1). 12.50.7.1.  To the front, sides, and rear of Second Generation HAS. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 231 12.50.7.2.  To the sides of a Korean Flow-Through HAS.  For the front and rear, apply default QD criteria. 12.50.8.  Apply  Table  12.26.  for  separation  of  unhardened  ES  from  First  Generation  and Korean  TAB  VEE  HASs  as  follows,  provided  the  NEWQD  limitations  of  paragraph 12.50.5. are met: (T-1). 12.50.8.1.  To the front, sides, and rear of First Generation HAS. 12.50.8.2.  To  the  sides  and  rear  of  a  Korean  TAB  VEE  HAS.    For  the  front,  apply default QD criteria. 12.50.9.  Apply Tables 12.25. or  12.26. for separation of unhardened ES from HAS Pairs, as appropriate, for the HAS Pair design involved. (T-1). 12.50.10.  First  Generation,  Second  Generation,  Third  Generation  and  Korean  TAB  VEE HASs sited for HD 1.2, HD 1.3, or HD 1.4 explosives, as shown below, do not generate a QD clear zone out the sides or rear.  Korean Flow-Through HASs sited for HD 1.2, HD 1.3, or HD 1.4 explosives, as shown below, do not generate a QD clear zone out the sides.  For HAS  pairs,  apply  the  requirements  for  the  HAS  pair  design  involved.  (T-1).    Default  QD criteria apply out the front of all HASs, and out the front and rear of Korean Flow-Through HASs. 12.50.10.1.  HD 1.2.1, with an MCE less than 110 lbs, and an NEWQD subject to the limitations in paragraph 12.50.5. 12.50.10.2.  Mission essential quantities of HD 1.2.2. 12.50.10.3.  HD  1.2.3,  with  a  largest  single  round  NEWQD  less  than  110  lbs  and  an NEWQD subject to the limitations in paragraph 12.50.5. 12.50.10.4.  Mission essential quantities of HD 1.3. 12.50.10.5.  Mission essential quantities of HD 1.4. 12.50.11.  A  HAS  used  solely  as  a  maintenance  facility  would  normally  be  classified  as  a related facility and would require ILD separation from a supported PES (except as permitted for a licensed facility or parking of explosives-loaded aircraft exempt from siting as a PES).  As an ES, a First, Second, or Third Generation Maintenance HAS provides K30 equivalent protection at the reduced distances shown in Table 12.24. with doors properly secured.  If Table  12.24.  is  not  applied  for  aircraft  survivability,  then  at  a  minimum,  provide  ILD equivalent protection (3.5 psi) to personnel within the maintenance HAS (T-1).. 12.50.12.  The front, side, or rear sectors of a HAS, as either a PES or an ES, are illustrated in Figure 12.3. 12.50.13.  Locate  occupied,  unhardened  facilities  no  closer  to  a  HAS  than  those  distances given in Tables 12.25. or  12.26. (T-1). 12.51.  Weapons Storage Vaults in Hardened Aircraft Shelters.  The nuclear weapon contents of a WSV will not contribute to an explosion in a HAS if certain separations are maintained.  The explosives in the WSV need not be considered when computing the NEWQD of the HAS if the presence and location of conventional munitions in the HAS correctly  conform to what is allowed by the applicable weapons system safety rules (WSSRs), AFI 91-112, Safety Rules for 232 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 US/NATO  Strike  Fighters.    Table  12.23.  provides  minimum  separation  distances  for  HASs containing WSVs from all other HASs, with or without WSVs. 12.52.  Revetments. 12.52.1.  A connected series of such revetments meeting the requirements of Section 6F may be sited for the explosives weight of one revetment. 12.52.2.  Site flightline revetment sets for combat aircraft parking and loading  as a CAPA according to Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. (T-1).  These revetment sets may be used for both aircraft parking and munitions holding.  Aircraft in revetments are afforded equivalent IMD separation.  Per Table 12.1., Note 14, two aircraft may be placed in a revetted cell at less than IMD without obtaining Commander approval; total the NEWQD of the two aircraft for determining QD separations to other exposures. 12.52.3.  Site  flightline  revetment  sets  used  for  munitions  as  flightline  munitions  holding areas according to Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. (T-1). 12.52.4.  Site revetment sets used solely for the storage of munitions as AGMs according to Tables 12.1.,  12.2., and  12.3. (T-1).  12.53.  Aircraft Battle Damage Repair Sites.  The maximum NEWQD charge permitted is two ounces of HD 1.1.  When using sandbags to cover charges and prevent fragment escape, a 300 foot clear zone is required.  For un-sandbagged charges, a 500 foot clear zone is necessary. 12.54.  Helicopter  Landing  Areas  for  AE  Operations.  Helicopter  landing  areas  for  loading and unloading AE within storage sites and quick reaction alert sites are considered AGM and may be sited at  IMD based only upon the NEWQD carried by the helicopter.  The  following requirements apply to these helicopter landing areas: 12.54.1.  Flight clearance criteria are met. 12.54.2.  Landing and takeoff approaches will not be over any AE facilities. 12.54.3.  Helicopter operations are to be limited to AE support of the facilities concerned. 12.54.4.  Carrying of passengers is not permitted. 12.54.5.  During helicopter takeoff, landing, or loading or unloading, AE operations will not be conducted at any PES located within IBD of the helicopter landing area.  During landing or takeoff, PES doors will be closed. 12.54.6.  Safety precautions normal to other modes of transportation are to be observed. 12.55.  Mobile  Missile  Systems  Used  in  a  Static,  Defensive  Role.  Mobile  Missile  Systems (e.g.,  Patriot,  THAAD,  NASAMS)  may  be  deployed  in  a  static  (non-mobile)  role  for  the protection of friendly forces and selected geopolitical assets from aerial and missile attack (e.g., main operating base (MOB), airfield, city). 12.55.1.  Mobile missile systems in a static role (MMS (SR)) can generate potential hazards to surrounding AE, operations, personnel, and facilities from: 12.55.1.1.  The explosion effects produced by an accidental explosion involving the AE associated with missile systems. 12.55.1.2.  EMR being emitted by the system (see AFI 91-208). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 233 12.55.1.3.  Backblast generated during a launch of a missile, placing nearby facilities at risk of collapse or damage from backblast pressures; windows may break and generate hazardous glass fragments; personnel with backblast distance may be severely injured. 12.55.2.  The following explosives safety requirements apply to MMS (SR) and associated support functions. (SR) IAW their  specific,  established 12.55.2.1.  Deploy  MMS implementation documentation (e.g., field manual, pamphlet, Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)), to include  establishing  prescribed  exclusionary  RF  hazard  and  backblast  zones,  as applicable.    Base  safe  separation  requirements  from  MMS  (SR)  and  support  structures (e.g., support crew and security force structures) on this guidance. 12.55.2.2.  Separate  individual  launcher  stations  and  any  re-loads  from  each  other  by IMD to minimize QD requirements, but if they are not, then sum the  NEWQD for  all launcher  stations  and  re-loads  together  and  used  as  the  basis  for  determining  required QD. 12.55.2.3.  Site MMS (SR) as AGMs to other PESs in the explosives clear zone where they are deployed. (T-1).  Provide IMD between MMS (SR)-related AE and surrounding AE storage.   (T-1). 12.55.2.4.  MMS(SR) may be treated as flightline Munitions Holding Areas to aircraft in the explosives clear zone where they are deployed.  No separation is required to military use only runways and taxiways. 12.55.2.5.  MMS(SR) deployed within the IBD of AE storage areas may be sited at ILD to  manned  functions  considered  related  to  area  AE  operations.    Likewise,  MMS  (SR) deployed  within  the  IBD  of  AE  flightline  operations  may  be  sited  at  ILD  to  manned flightline support facilities. 12.55.2.6.  Those  manned  functions  solely  providing  support  to  MMS  (SR)  operations (e.g.,  motor  pools)  may  be  sited  at  ILD  from  the  MMS  (SR)  and  other  PESs  in  the explosives clear zone where they are deployed. 12.55.2.7.  Provide  IBD/PTRD,  as  appropriate,  to  personnel  not  associated  with  AE operations. (T-1). 12.56.  Tactical Missile Separations. 12.56.1.  AIM-7 Missiles (Other than Weapon Adapter Unit (WAU)-17 Warhead). 12.56.1.1.  When  these  conditions  are  met  MCE  is  limited  to  a  single  AIM-7  warhead with an HD of (02)1.1. 12.56.1.1.1.  Separate warheads of adjacent AIM-7 missiles by 5 inches or more. (T-1). 12.56.1.1.2.  Separate  AIM-7  warheads  from  all  AIM-9  warheads  by  at  least  22 inches, or ensure warheads are not radially aligned. (T-1). 12.56.1.2.  See Table 12.5. for HFD for missiles at less than 5 inches from each other, if they  are  in  the  open  or  in  a  light  structure  which  cannot  stop  primary  fragments  (see Table 12.2. Legend). 234 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.56.1.3.  Containers.  All missiles in an AURC will sympathetically detonate; therefore the MCE is all four warheads in the AURC.  AIM-7 missiles that explode in an AURC will not propagate to  warheads in  adjacent containers,  either vertically  or horizontally.  MCE is limited to four warheads. 12.56.1.4.  In an ECM, the following configurations allow a reduced MCE: 12.56.1.4.1.  Packed in an AURC, the MCE is four warheads. 12.56.1.4.2.  For  trailers,  with  or  without  other  AIM-7  (not  WAU-17)  or  AIM-9 missiles,  the  MCE  is  the  total  quantity  of  all  warheads  radially  aligned  and  at  less than 100 inches from each other. 12.56.2.  AIM-7 Missiles (WAU-17 Warhead). 12.56.2.1.  These  warheads  can  sympathetically  detonate  other  HD  1.1  explosives  in radial alignment of the warhead.  Use radial aligned separation distance of 100 inches or more to prevent propagation of one warhead to another. (T-1). 12.56.2.2.  See Table 12.5. for HFD for missiles in radial alignment and at less than 100 inches from each other, if they are in the open or in a light structure which cannot stop primary fragments (see Table 12.2, A. through C.). 12.56.2.3.  Containers.  All missiles in an AURC will sympathetically detonate; therefore the  MCE  is  all  four  warheads  in  the  AURC  (36  lbs  x  4  or  144  lbs).    Detonation  of warheads in an AURC will not transfer to adjacent containers side-by-side, but containers within  a  single  vertical  stack  must  be  alternated,  nose-to-tail,  to  prevent  propagation vertically. (T-1).  MCE would then be four warheads. 12.56.2.4.  In an ECM, the following configurations allow a reduced MCE: 12.56.2.4.1.  For alternately stack containers (per paragraph 12.56.2.3.) and trailers not in radial alignment, the MCE is four warheads. 12.56.2.4.2.  For  alternately  stacked  containers  (per  paragraph  12.56.2.3.)  and  no more than three trailers in radial alignment, the MCE is twelve warheads. 12.56.2.5.  For  ECM  storage  other  than  that  described  in  paragraph  12.56.2.4.,  and storage in all other heavy structures capable of stopping primary fragments, MCE is the total  number  of  warheads  in  the  structure  unless  a  lesser  MCE  is  approved  by AFSEC/SEW (see Table 12.2., A. through C.). 12.56.3.  AIM-9 Missiles. 12.56.3.1.  A warhead detonation will not cause sympathetic detonation of adjacent AIM-9 missiles provided warheads are separated by 22 inches or more, or warheads are not radially aligned.  If these conditions are met, MCE is limited to a single AIM-9 warhead. 12.56.3.2.  See Table 12.5. for HFD in the open. 12.56.3.3.  AIM-9 missiles that detonate in an AURC will not propagate to any adjacent container either vertically or horizontally.  MCE is limited to four warheads. 12.56.4.  AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). 12.56.4.1.  Out of container, these missiles are HD 1.1.  In an AURC, they are HD 1.2.1. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 235 12.56.4.2.  MCE is limited to a single AIM-120 missile when the warheads of adjacent AIM-120  missiles  are  separated  by  100  inches  or  more.    See  Table  12.5.  for  single missile HFD. 12.56.4.3.  See Table 12.5. for HFD for missiles in radial alignment and at less than 100 inches from each other. 12.56.4.4.  Containers.  All missiles in an AURC will sympathetically detonate; therefore the  MCE  is  all  four  warheads  in  the  AURC.    For  AIM-120s  with  the  WDU-33/B warhead, the AURC MCE is 68 lbs.  For AIM-120s with the WDU-41B warhead, the AURC MCE is 76 lbs. 12.56.5.  Single container MCEs may be used for mixed storage  configurations of  AIM-7,   AIM-9 and AIM-120 missile containers provided the following conditions are met: 12.56.5.1.  Each stack of containers contains the same type of missile and warhead. 12.56.5.2.  Each stack is no more than three containers high. 12.56.5.3.  For  containers  of  AIM-7  missiles  with  the  WAU-l0  warhead:  (1)  orient  the missiles  in  the  same  direction  within  the  container,  (2)  there  is  no  restriction  on  the orientation  of  the  containers  relative  to  one  another  within  a  stack,  (3)  there  is  no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required separation between stacks. (T-1).  MCE of the  stack(s) is 105 pounds (lbs) of HD 1.1 (based on the four warheads a single container). 12.56.5.4.  For containers of AIM-7 missiles with the WAU-17 warhead: (1) orient the missiles  in  the  same  direction  within  the  container,  (2)  the  containers  within  a  single stack  must  be  alternated  (nose-to-tail),  (3)  there  is  no  restriction  on  the  orientation  of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required separation between stacks. (T-1).  MCE  of  the  stack(s)  is  144lbs  of  HD  1.1  (based  on  the  four  warheads  in  a  single container). 12.56.5.5.  For containers of AIM-9 missiles with the WDU-l7 warhead: (1) there is no restriction on the orientation of the missiles relative to one another within a container, (2) there is no restriction on the orientation of the containers relative to one another within a stack, (3) there is no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required separation between stacks.  MCE of the stack(s) is 36.4 lbs of HD 1.1 (based on the four warheads in a single container). 12.56.5.6.  For containers of AIM-120 missiles with the WDU-33/B warhead: (1) orient the missiles in the same direction within the container, (2) there is no restriction on the orientation  of  the  containers  relative  to  one  another  within  a  stack,  (3)  there  is  no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required separation distance between stacks.  (T-1).  The stack(s) is HD 1.2.1 with an MCE of 68 lbs (based on the four missiles in a single container). 12.56.5.7.  For containers of AIM-120 missiles with the WDU-41/B warhead: (1) orient the missiles in the same direction within the container, (2) there is no restriction on the orientation  of  the  containers  relative  to  one  another  within  a  stack,  (3)  there  is  no restriction on the orientation of containers between stacks, and (4) there is no required 236 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 separation distance between stacks.  (T-1).  The stack(s) is HD 1.2.1 with an MCE of 76 lbs (based on the four missiles in a single container). 12.56.5.8.  Separate  stacks  of  differing  missile  and  warhead  configurations  from  each other by a horizontal distance of 100 inches (e.g., stacks of AIM-7/WAU-10 containers will be separated by a horizontal distance of 100 inches from stacks of AIM-7/WAU-17 containers). (T-1). 12.56.5.9.  When the above conditions are met, the storage of mixed AIM-7, AIM-9 and AIM-120 missile containers (with the specified warheads) may be sited using the most restrictive of the following: 12.56.5.9.1.  Site  the  greatest  MCE  present  as  HD  1.1  (regardless  of  whether  the greatest MCE is for HD 1.1 or HD 1.2.1). 12.56.5.9.2.  Site the total HD 1.2.1 NEWQD present. (T-1). 12.56.6.  AGM-65 Maverick Missiles.  Explosives weights of individual AGM-65 missiles or loaded launchers need not be added together if adjacent missiles or launchers are separated by  at  least  130  inches  and  the  nose  of  any  AGM-65  missile  does  not  point  at  any  other missile. 12.56.7.  AGM-88  High-Speed  Anti-radiation  Missile  (HARM).   For  storage  and transportation in an AURC, missiles are assigned HD 1.2.1, with an MCE <100 lbs.  Out of container,  missiles  are  assigned  HD  (04)1.1.    A  warhead  detonation  will  not  cause sympathetic detonation of adjacent warheads if they are separated by at least 6 inches, or if the warheads are not radially aligned. 12.56.8.  Mixed Trailer Loads.  Use criteria above and configurations as shown in TO 11-1-38, Positioning and Tie-Down Procedures – Nonnuclear Munitions, to determine MCE. 12.57.  Inspection Stations for AE Conveyances. 12.57.1.  Inspection  stations  for  trucks,  trailers  and  railcars  containing  AE  that  are  used exclusively for the activities below are not subject to QD criteria.  However, these stations must  be  located  as  far  as  practical  from  other  hazards  (e.g.,  explosives,  POL),  populated areas, and flightlines, and the AE conveyance promptly removed. (T-1).  Allowable activities are: 12.57.1.1.  External visual inspection of the railcars or trucks containing AE. 12.57.1.2.  Visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo packaging in vehicles that have passed the external inspection indicated in paragraph 12.57.1.1. 12.57.1.3.  Interchange of trucks, trailers, or railcars containing AE between the common carrier and the DoD activity. 12.57.2.  Apply applicable QD criteria if inspection stations are used for any other purpose (e.g., explosives storage, suspect vehicle holding area). (T-1). 12.58.  Interchange Yards for AE Conveyances. 12.58.1.  Interchange  yards for trucks, trailers, and railcars containing AE used exclusively for  the  activities  below  are  not  subject  to  QD  criteria.    However,  locate  these  interchange AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 237 yards  as  far  as  practical  from  other  hazards  (e.g.,  explosives,  POL),  populated  areas,  and flightlines, and promptly remove the AE conveyance. (T-1).  Allowable activities are: 12.58.1.1.  External inspection of the trucks, trailers, or railcars containing AE. 12.58.1.2.  Visual inspection of the external condition of the cargo packaging in vehicles that passed the external inspection indicated in paragraph 12.58.1.1. 12.58.1.3.  Interchange of trucks, trailers or railcars containing AE between the common carrier and the DoD activity. 12.58.2.  Apply  applicable  QD  criteria  if  truck,  trailer,  or  railcar  interchanges  are  used  for any other purpose (e.g., explosives storage, suspect vehicle holding area). (T-1). 12.59.  Holding Yards for AE Conveyances. 12.59.1.  Site vehicle and rail holding yards as AGM per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. (T-1). 12.59.1.1.  Where  possible,  separate  explosives-loaded  vehicles  and  railcars  from  each other by the applicable IMD.  Distances to other exposures are then based on the vehicle and railcar with the largest NEWQD. 12.59.1.2.  If IMD between vehicles and railcars cannot be met, park vehicles and railcars in groups, with IMD between each group.  Base distances to other exposures on the total amount of explosives within the group of vehicles or railcars with the largest NEWQD. 12.59.1.3.  Where paragraph 12.59.1.1. or  12.59.1.2. above is not possible, use the total NEWQD of all vehicles or railcars to determine separation distances. 12.59.2.  In addition to the temporary parking of railcars, trucks, or trailers containing AE, holding yards may be used to interchange truck, trailers or railcars between the commercial carrier  and  the  DoD  activity,  and  to  conduct  visual  inspections,  but  cannot  be  used simultaneously for these activities. 12.59.3.  In developing large rail holding yards, consider the following layout guidance: 12.59.3.1.  Design rail holding yards on a unit car or explosives weight group basis (e.g., 50,000, 100,000, or 250,000 net pounds of HD 1.1 explosives, regardless of the number of cars involved).  Separate each explosives quantity car group from all other groups by IMD. (T-1). 12.59.3.2.  Yards  may  be  formed  by  two  parallel  ladder  tracks  connected  by  diagonal spurs or by a “Christmas tree” arrangement (a ladder track with diagonal dead-end spurs projecting  from  each  side  at  alternate  intervals).    Other  arrangements  tailored  to  the operation are allowed.  However, separate parallel tracks and spurs of all types by IMD for the quantities of AE involved. (T-1). 12.60.  Classification Yards. 12.60.1.  Where  the  volume  of  vehicle  or  rail  traffic  necessitates,  establish  a  classification yard  primarily  for  receiving,  classifying,  switching,  and  dispatching  explosives-laden vehicles and railcars. 12.60.2.  As an ES, site classification yards at IMD from all PESs. (T-1). 238 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.60.3.  Classification  yards  do  not  require  siting  as  a  PES  provided  they  are  used exclusively for: 12.60.3.1.  Receiving, dispatching, classifying, and switching of cars. 12.60.3.2.  Interchanging of trucks, trailers, or railcars between the common carrier and the DoD activity. 12.60.3.3.  Conducting  external  inspection  of  vehicles  or  railcars,  or  opening  of  free rolling  doors  of  railcars  for  the  purpose  of  removing  documents  and  making  a  visual inspection of the cargo.  Freeing or repairing a stuck or damaged door or doing any work inside a car is prohibited unless QD requirements can be met. 12.60.4.  Specific  QD  separation  applies  if  the  classification  yard  is  used  for  any  other purpose  (e.g.,  placing  or  removing  dunnage  or  explosive  items  into  or  from  vehicles  or railcars). 12.61.  AE  Transportation  Mode  Change  Locations.  Site  transportation  mode  change locations as operating locations per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. (T-1). 12.62.  Suspect Vehicle Holding Areas.  Move explosives-loaded vehicles or railcars found or suspected  to  be  in  a  hazardous  condition  to  a  suspect  vehicle  holding  area,  unless  it  is  more hazardous to move the vehicle or railcar.  Separate suspect vehicle holding areas (isolated) from other PES or ES by the applicable QD treating the holding area as an AGM. 12.63.  Secure Holding Areas. 12.63.1.  Secure  holding  areas  are  designated  for  the  temporary  parking  of  commercial carriers'  motor  vehicles  transporting  DoD-owned  Arms,  Ammunition,  and  Explosives (AAE), classified (SECRET or CONFIDENTIAL) materials, and Controlled Cryptographic Items  (CCI).    There  are  two  types  of  secure  holding  areas  and  the  criteria  for  each  are provided below.  Installations must site secure holding areas to meet known taskings. (T-1).  The term Secure Holding Area is applicable to areas (CONUS, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico) governed by MIL-STD-882E, Standard Practice for System Safety, and DTR 4500.9-R-Part II. Note:  The intent of secure holding areas is to provide a secure storage location for commercial carriers while in-transit, during emergencies or other circumstances that are beyond a carrier’s control.   12.63.1.1.  Secure  Explosives  Holding  Area.    Site  as  a  holding  yard  per  paragraph 12.59. (T-1). 12.63.1.2.  Secure Non-explosives Holding Area.  No siting required if located outside all QD arcs.  If located within a QD arc, site at PTRD from all PESs. (T-1).  The holding of HD 1.4S materials, without regard to QD, is permitted at this location. 12.63.2.  See paragraph 1.5. when there is no Secure Holding Area sited for the NEWQD or HD of the vehicle for unforeseen taskings.    AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.64.  Detached Loading Docks. 239 12.64.1.  Site detached loading docks that service multiple facilities on the basis of use with regard to the facilities serviced, as shown below. (T-1).  Site these loading docks as AGM with regard to all other facilities. (T-1). 12.64.2.  When servicing magazines, separate such docks from the magazines by IMD, based only on the explosives limit of the loading dock. (T-1). 12.64.3.  When  servicing  operating  buildings,  separate  such  docks  from  the  operating building by ILD, based only on the explosives limit of the loading dock. (T-1). 12.64.4.  Loading  docks  that  support  a  single  PES  do  not  require  QD  separation  from  the supported PES. 12.65.  Service Magazines for Operating Locations. 12.65.1.  Apply ILD from a service magazine to the operating location it supports. (T-1).  No QD  separation  is  required  from  the  supported  operating  location  back  to  the  service magazine.  See paragraph 12.12.2. 12.65.2.  Site the service magazine as an AGM per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. to all PESs that it does not support. (T-1). 12.65.3.  Do  not  use  railcars  and  vehicles  as  service  magazines  for  explosives  operating locations, unless such use is essential. 12.66.  Non-Explosives Loaded Vehicle Parking Areas. 12.66.1.  Reference  DoD  5100.76-M,  Physical  Security  of  Sensitive  Conventional  Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives, for parking POVs in an MSA. 12.66.2.  Site parking areas not supporting the explosives mission (such as parking lots for administrative  areas)  as  PTR  exposures  per  Tables  12.1.,    12.2.  and    12.3.  (T-1).    A minimum  100  foot  separation  distance  is  required  unless  a  greater  minimum  distance  is specified in Tables 12.1.,  12.2., or  12.3. (T-1). Note:  Motor pools normally require IBD because of office, workshops, and other inhabited buildings.  12.66.3.  Site POV, GOV, and powered AGE parking areas supporting PESs a minimum of 100  feet  from  PESs  to  protect  PESs  from  vehicle  fires.  (T-1).    The  minimum  100-foot separation may be reduced to 50 feet provided the PESs are of non-combustible construction and  sufficient  measures  are  in  place  between  the  parking  spaces  and  PESs  to  prevent  a parked vehicle or powered AGE from rolling to within 50 feet of PESs (e.g., sloping grade, curbs, vehicle barriers, drainage features).  Access for emergency vehicles must be provided. (T-1).    The  provisions  of  this  paragraph  do  not  negate  the  need  to  comply  with  any applicable security requirements for POV access to or parking in explosives areas. See DoD 5100.76-M.) 12.66.4.  Temporary parking of GOVs or AGE, other than those being loaded or unloaded, will not be closer than 25 feet to any PES. (T-1).  Temporary means the length of time the presence of the vehicle is essential to completion of a single task (e.g., a single work order number). 240 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.66.5.  Site parking areas used exclusively for non-munitions WRM vehicles at ILD from all PESs. (T-1).  A minimum 100-foot separation distance is required.  Use PTRD or IBD, when  possible,  to  prevent  unacceptable  damage  to  critical  war  support  vehicles  and equipment. 12.67.  Inert Storage. 12.67.1.  Unoccupied  inert  storage  facilities  that  are  directly  related  to  the  explosives mission, and unoccupied inert storage facilities not directly related but where control of and access to such inert storage is restricted only to personnel directly related to the explosives mission, may be located at fire protection distance from all related PESs (100 feet if the PES structure  is  combustible;  50  feet  if  the  PES  structure  is  non-combustible).    Determine locations for such inert storage facilities only after consideration of personnel exposure, the importance of the materiel in relation to the explosives mission, the operational conditions, and the availability of space. 12.67.2.  Site  unoccupied  inert  storage  not  directly  related  to  the  explosives  mission  and when accessed by personnel not directly related to the explosives mission as a PTR exposure per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3., when located in the open (no structure involved). (T-1).  Base the PTRD on blast overpressure only and do not use fragment distances.  Locate such inert storage within an explosives clear zone only after consideration of personnel exposure, the importance of the materiel in relation to the mission, the operational conditions, and the availability of space.  Minimum fire protection distances given in paragraph 12.67.1. apply. 12.67.3.  Site  unoccupied  inert  storage  not  directly  related  to  the  explosives  mission  and when  accessed  by  personnel  not  directly  related  to  the  explosives  mission  as  an  inhabited building per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3., when located in a structure. (T-1).  Base the IBD on  blast  overpressure  only  and  do  not  use  fragment  distances.    Minimum  fire  protection distances given in paragraph 12.67.1. apply. 12.67.4.  Site  occupied  inert  storage  facilities  (e.g.,  warehouses)  supporting  the  explosives mission as related facilities per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. from the PESs they support. (T-1). 12.67.5.  Site  occupied  inert  storage  facilities  (e.g.,  warehouses)  not  supporting  the explosives mission as inhabited buildings per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. (T-1). 12.67.6.  Site related non-munitions WRM storage at ILD from all PESs. (T-1).  Use PTRD or IBD, when possible, to prevent unacceptable damage to critical war support assets.  See paragraph 12.67.2. and  12.67.3. for non-related unoccupied non-munitions WRM storage. 12.68.  Protective Shielding and Remotely Controlled Operations.  For operations requiring protective shielding or remote control per paragraph 4.17., see paragraph 7.29. for operating requirements and apply the following QD separations: 12.68.1.  As an ES, treat as an operating location per Tables 12.1.,  12.2. and  12.3. 12.68.2.  As a PES: 12.68.2.1.  Provide  equivalent  PTRD  protection  for  blast  and  thermal  hazards;  and equivalent IBD protection for fragment hazards, to related personnel. (T-1). 12.68.2.2.  Provide IBD to all other non-related occupied ESs. (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 241 12.68.2.3.  Treat  as  an  operating  location  per  Tables  12.1.,    12.2.  and    12.3.,  for protection of unoccupied ESs; use of Table 12.1., Note 21 is not allowed. (T-1). 12.69.  Buffered Storage. 12.69.1.  Buffered Storage Concept.  Under certain conditions, propagation can be prevented between stacks of tritonal-filled MK-82 and MK-84 bombs.  NEWQD for QD purposes is the explosives weight of the largest stack plus explosives weight of intervening buffer material (excluding HD 1.4).  Buffered storage can be used for ECMs, AGMs, or open stacks.  The following limitations apply: 12.69.1.1.  Limit stacks to 64 MK84 or 312 MK82 bombs and limit combined stacks to 60,500 lbs NEWQD. (T-1). 12.69.1.2.  Acceptable  buffer  materials  are:    palletized  20  mm  ammunition,  palletized 30mm  ammunition,  or  CBU-58s  packaged  two  per  metal  container,  stacked  one  pallet wide (one container CBU-58) and as high as the protected stack. 12.69.1.3.  Position buffer materials between the two stacks of bombs to prevent line-of-sight exposure between stacks. (T-1). 12.69.1.4.  Use steel nose and tail plugs in all bombs.  Arrange bombs so the noses of the bombs in each stack are facing the buffer. (T-1). 12.69.1.5.  Maintain  a  minimum  of  38  feet  between  the  nearest  bombs  of  the  separate stacks.   (T-1).  For bomb stacks of 24,000 lbs NEWQD or less, 20 feet is acceptable.  Arrange the stacks within a structure so access is possible to verify the configuration. 12.69.1.6.  Use only serviceable munitions in the bomb stacks or the buffer stacks. 12.69.1.7.  Removed  buffer  material  for  periodic  inspections  does  not  affect  sited capacities if returned within 24 hours. 12.69.1.8.  Buffered  storage  is  approved  for  storage  in  locations  where  US  explosives safety  standards  are  the  only  criteria  applied.    In  locations  where  the  host-nation  has established  safety  criteria,  these  principles  must  be  accepted  by  the  host-nation  before they may be applied. (T-1). 12.69.2.  Units  wanting  to  use  different  configurations  or  buffer  materials  must  submit definitive drawings through the MAJCOM to AFSEC/SEW for approval. (T-1).  These new buffers  will  consist  of  HD  1.2,  1.4,  or  inert  materials  that  have  an  aerial  density  of  500 pounds per square foot.  For bomb stacks less than 24,000 lbs NEWQD, an aerial density of 250 pounds per square foot is acceptable. 12.70.  Angled Storage. 12.70.1.  Angled Storage Concept.  Tests have shown that fragments from an exploding MK-82/84  bomb  that  are  capable  of  initiating  a  nearby  bomb  are  limited  to  a  zone  extending perpendicular  to  the  bomb.    Therefore  positioning  of  bombs  outside  the  fragment  zone  of other bombs may significantly reduce the MCE. 12.70.2.  Angled Storage in HASs. 242 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.70.2.1.  Place single bombs and loaded triple ejector racks (TER), or bomb rack units (BRU) at a 15 degree angle along one shelter wall. (T-1).  Angle bomb and rack away from the aircraft and point tails toward the wall. (T-1). 12.70.2.2.  Maintain 4-foot separation distance from MK-84s to other weapons and 30-inch separation from MK-82s to other weapons. (T-1). 12.70.2.3.  Do not align unfuzed cavities of bombs. 12.70.2.4.  Install fuzes, boosters, steel nose and tail plugs or guidance packages. 12.70.2.5.  Do not place bombs in an area on either side of another bomb bounded by two lines,  20  degrees  forward  and  aft  of  lines  perpendicular  to  the  bomb  centerline  and starting at the nose and the tail of the bomb, respectively (see Figure 12.8.). 12.70.2.6.  If above criteria is complied with, the MCE is the cumulative NEWQD of one TER  or  BRU,  or  for  single  angled  bombs,  it  is  the  NEWQD  of  one  bomb.    When  an explosives  loaded  aircraft  is  in  the  HAS,  combine  the  weight  of  the  explosives  on  the aircraft and the stored weapons if either the weapons on the aircraft or the stored weapons are in the fragment zone, described above, of the other weapons. 12.71.  Locations Used for Intentional Burning of HD  1.1, HD  1.2, HD  1.3, or HD  1.4 AE or Static Firing of Motors.  Criteria in this section are provided for intentional burns or static motor firing requiring siting per this Manual.  The required QD in this section are only based on the AE’s energetic reaction (thermal, blast overpressure, and  fragmentation).  Treat items that have not been hazard classified IAW with TO 11A-1-47 as HD 1.1 for application of the criteria in this section.  The criteria in this section do not consider toxicity, noise, or potential downwind hazards.    Therefore,  QD  may  not  be  the  only  factor  considered  when  selecting  a  location  for intentional  burning  or  static  motor  firing.    Check  environmental  compliance  and  Resource Conservation  and  Recovery  Act  (RCRA)  requirements  and  permits  for  this  operation.    For overseas  locations,  check  SOFA  and  applicable  technical  agreements  for  any  applicable environmental protection requirements. 12.71.1.  General. 12.71.1.1.  The  QD  criteria  for  siting  of  intentional  burns  or  static  motor  firing  apply from the moment of initiation through the duration of the burning operation.  Prior to the actual burning or static motor firing event, operations may proceed using unintentional detonation QD. 12.71.1.2.  The criteria in paragraph 12.71. are based on the potential for an unintended transition of a burning reaction to a reaction greater than burning (up to and including detonation  of  all  the  explosives  present).    The  key  to  minimizing  the  potential  for reactions greater than burning is to ensure the depth of explosives (or size of a clock or container of explosives) is limited such that it is unsufficient to “confine” the reaction.  Minimizing  the  total  amount  of  explosives  being  burned  at  any  given  time  will  also minimize the potential damage in the event of a reaction greater than burning. 12.71.1.3.  The criteria in paragraph 12.71. do not address the hazards associated with burning AE or static firing of motors inside a structure;  the appropriate criteria for these situations  must  be  addressed  on  a  case-by-case  basis  to  determine  if  the  structural AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 243 confinement may increase the potential for a reaction greater than burning, and to address the potential secondary debris hazards. 12.71.2.  Protective Construction.  Use DDESB-approved protective structures or measures to suppress thermal, blast, or fragment effects to reduce the required Minimum Separation Distance (MSD); see TP-15 for existing designs. (T-1).  Use protective construction analyses to  reduce  the  required  MSD  and  submit  these  analyses  with  the  ESP  and  demonstrate personnel  protection  as  specified  in  Section  4F  for  essential  personnel,  or  protection equivalent to the criteria in paragraph 12.71.6. for non-essential personnel. (T-1).  Analyses intended  to  justify  a  reduced  MSD  must  consider  the  actual  composition,  configuration, properties, characteristics, behaviors, etc., of the material to be burned, and the potential for and severity of reactions greater than burning. 12.71.3.  NEW.    The  criteria  in  paragraph  12.71.  are  applied  based  on  NEW  versus NEWQD.  Use the total NEW present for QD calculations, unless IMD (based on the HD) is met between burning locations.  There is no requirement to adjust the NEW to address TNT equivalency.  However, if TNT equivalency is addressed, it should be done per paragraphs 12.71.3.1. and  12.71.3.2. 12.71.3.1.  Overpressure Calculations.  If known, apply TNT equivalencies greater than one to the NEW.  Do not use TNT equivalencies of less than one unless supported by data. 12.71.3.2.  Fragment Distance Calculations.  Make no adjustment for TNT equivalency when determining the HFD IAW paragraph 12.71.6. except when doing an item-specific calculation IAW DDESB TP-16. 12.71.4.  Damaged AE.  Damaged AE refers to damage that could significantly increase the likelihood of a reaction more severe than burning (i.e., an explosion or detonation) occurring (e.g., cracked propellant in a motor or a damaged motor case, might easily lead to a pressure rupture of the motor case at a minimum).  If the condition of an item is unknown, assume it to be damaged.  For burning of damaged HD 1.1, HD 1.2 or HD 1.3 AE, or the static firing of damaged HD 1.1 or 1.3 motors, apply the intentional detonation criteria of paragraph 12.72. unless  an  analysis  is  provided  to  show  that  the  AE  configuration  cannot  transition  to  a reaction greater than burning. (T-1). 12.71.5.  Essential Personnel MSD. 12.71.5.1.  Use K24 in the QD formula for the NEW to determine the MSD for personnel burning  AE.  (T-1).    The  K24  distance  only  provides  protection  for  blast  and  thermal hazards per Section 4F.  K24 may not provide protection, especially for small NEWs, from fragments or debris from an unintentional reaction, or even from other projections or firebrands generated by the intentional burning.  Distances greater than K24 may be required based on the hazards associated with the specific burning operation. 12.71.5.2.  For  burning  of  AE  in  packaging  that  may  produce  debris,  the  non-essential personnel MSD is the unintentional detonation IBD using the NEW (i.e., larger of K24 in the  QD  formula  for  overpressure  or  the  HFD  using  the  “Structure”  column  of  Table 12.4.). 244 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.71.5.3.  For  burning  AE  in  casing  that  may  produce  primary  fragments,  the  non-essential  personnel  MSD  is  the  unintentional  detonation  IBD  using  the  NEW  (i.e.,  the larger of K24 in the QD formula for overpressure or the HFD per paragraph 12.23. 12.71.6.  Non-Essential Personnel MSD and Non-Related Exposure MSD. 12.71.6.1.  Burning of HD 1.1, HD 1.2, HD 1.3 or HD 1.4 AE. 12.71.6.1.1.  For  burning  of  bare  (i.e.,  no  fragment-producing  casing  or  packaging) AE, the non-essential personnel MSD is K40 in the QD formula using the NEW with a minimum of 75 ft. 12.71.6.1.2.  For  burning  of  AE  in  packaging  that  may  produce  debris,  the  non-essential  personnel  MSD  is  the  unintentional  detonation  IBD  using  the  NEW  (i.e., larger of K40 in the QD formula for overpressure or the HFD using the “Structure” column of Table 12.4. 12.71.6.1.3.  For  burning  of  AE  casings  that  may  produce  primary  fragments,  the non-essential  personnel  MSD  is  the  unintentional  detonation  IBD  using  the  NEW (i.e., larger of K40 in the QD formula for overpressure or the HFD per paragraph 12.23.). 12.71.7.  Static Firing of HD 1.1 or HD 1.3 Motors. 12.71.7.1.  For  static  firing  of  HD  1.1  or  1.3  motors,  the  non-essential  personnel/non-related exposure MSD is the unintentional detonation IBD (i.e., larger of K40 in the QD formula for overpressure, HFD per paragraph 12.23., or 300 foot minimum distance). 12.71.7.2.  For static firing of HD 1.1 or 1.3 motors, the non-essential personnel/related exposure  MSD  is  the  larger  of  K24  in  the  QD  formula  for  overpressure,  HFD  per paragraph 12.23., or 300 foot minimum distance. 12.71.7.3.  The flame exposure area is 45 degrees on either side of the flame exit nozzle or port.  The installation will ensure directional effects from static firing of motors are addressed (e.g., structural analysis of the restraint system/device). (T-1). 12.71.7.4.  These  distances  can  be  reduced  by  using  DDESB-approved  protective structures  or  measures  to  suppress  thermal,  blast  or  fragment  effects  per  paragraph 12.71.2. 12.71.8.  Other Applicable QD. 12.71.8.1.  The intentional burning or static motor firing areas/pads/stands will be sited at ILD from other PESs as an AE operating location. (T-1). 12.71.8.2.  Locations Used for Intentional Burns or Static Motor Firing. 12.71.8.2.1.  Prior to actual burning or static motor firing, site the location as an AE operating location. (T-1). 12.71.8.2.2.  During  burning  or  static  motor  firing,  apply  non-essential  personnel MSD to personnel conducting unrelated AE operations. 12.72.  Areas  Used  for  Intentional  Detonations.  This  paragraph  does  not  apply  to  EOD training sites, off range locations, emergency operations, or range clearance operations where the AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 245 expected  blast/fragmentation  effects  does  not  exceed  existing  range  surface  danger  zones  as defined in AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations (see paragraphs 12.74.,  12.75.3., and  4.20., as applicable). 12.72.1.  Check  environmental  compliance  and  Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery  Act (RCRA) requirements and permits for this operation.  For overseas locations, check SOFA and  applicable technical  agreements  for  any  applicable  environmental  protection requirements. 12.72.2.  Shaped charge jets or slugs from directed energy munitions can travel significantly greater  distances  than  case  fragments;  therefore,  these  munitions  require  specific  analysis.  For information on an item, contact the program manager for the munition. 12.72.3.  Use  the  following  criteria  from  the  detonation  area  to  all  locations  involving personnel that are not essential to the planned detonation, non-explosives facilities not related to the detonation, locations with exposed aircraft and open explosives storage locations.  If the  minimum  separation  distance  requirements  for  previously  approved  DDESB  sitings  or those prescribed in this section cannot be met, provide personnel the protection specified in paragraph 4.17. Note:  The calculation of NEWQD for EOD intentional detonations differs from that used for transportation and storage.  For intentional detonations, NEWQD can never be less than the NEW; and, TNT equivalency must be factored-in for specific HE being used.  Address the NEWQD and TNT equivalent determination for EOD intentional detonation per 60-Series Publications, AFTO 60A-1-1-4, Protection of Personnel and Property, and EOD Tactical Decision Aid. 12.72.3.1.  For non-fragmenting AE, use K328 with a minimum distance of 200 feet. (T-1). 12.72.3.2.  For fragmenting AE, use the larger of the two distances given in paragraphs 12.74.3.2.1. and  12.74.3.2.2. (T-1). 12.72.3.2.1.  K328 with a minimum distance of 200 feet. 12.72.3.2.2.  The  distances  given  in  Table  12.27.  or  Table  12.28.    As  calculated (using DDESB Technical Paper 16) or measured maximum fragment throw distance (including  the  interaction  effects  for  stacks  of  items  or  single  items,  whichever applies)  may  also  be  used  to  replace  these  distances.    Calculated  case  fragment maximum throw distances for selected munitions are listed in the Fragmentation Data Review Form located on the DDESB secure web page.  This database is included in TP 16. Note:  Tables 12.27. and 12.28. as well as the Fragmentation Data Review Form in TP 16, are for individual items.  These distances do not directly apply to stacks of munitions.  Further, these throw distances do not consider fragments that are produced by sections of nose plugs, base plates, boattails, or lugs.  These fragments are sometimes referred to as “rogue” fragments.  In addition, shaped charge jets or slugs from directed energy munitions can travel significantly greater distances than case fragments; therefore, these munitions require specific analysis.  12.72.3.2.2.1.  “Rogue”  fragments  produced  by  sections  of  nose  plugs,  base plates,  or  lugs,  etc.  can  travel  significantly  greater  distances  (more  than  10,000 246 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 feet) than those shown in Tables 12.27. and  12.28.  Take care to properly orient the  munition  (e.g.,  lugs  or  strongbacks  and  nose  or  tail  plate  sections  oriented away from personnel locations) or to minimize or eliminate the hazard of rogue fragments  (e.g.,  sand  bagging  the  munition  prior  to  detonation,  or  removing components).    For  such  bombs  and  projectiles  with  a  caliber  exceeding  five inches,  bury  or  cover  the  munition  according  to  the  Buried  Explosion  Module procedures outlined in DDESB TP 16. (T-1). 12.72.3.2.2.2.  For  detonation  of  multiple  munitions,  comply  with  the  following unless an approved technical order alternative is authorized (EOD will use Joint Service 60 Series EOD manuals): (T-1). 12.72.3.2.2.2.1.  Place the munitions in a single layer with their sides touching such that their axis is horizontal. 12.72.3.2.2.2.2.  Place  the  munitions  so  that  the  nose  of  each  munition  is pointing in the same direction. 12.72.3.2.2.2.3.  Orient the munitions so that lugs or strongbacks and nose or tail plate sections are facing away from areas to be protected. 12.72.3.2.2.2.4.  Initiate  the  stack  detonation  so  that  all  munitions  detonate simultaneously. 12.72.3.2.2.2.5.  Use the  procedures  outlined paragraphs 12.72.3.2.2.2.1. through  12.72.3.2.2.2.4. cannot be met: (T-1). the  following  when in then increase the  separation  distance  required  by 12.72.3.2.2.2.5.1.  If the orientation of the potential rogue fragments can be controlled, the Fragmentation Data Review Form in TP 16 by 33 percent to account for the interaction effects and/or non-design mode initiation. 12.72.3.2.2.2.5.2.  If the orientation of potential rogue fragments cannot be controlled, evaluate fragment ranges on a case-by-case basis. 12.72.3.2.2.2.5.3.  If  detonations involve  stacks  of  mixed  munitions, evaluate the distance for each munition separately using the procedures in paragraph 12.72.3.2.2. and select the largest distance. 12.72.4.  Use  the  following  criteria  from  the  detonation  area  to  all  locations  involving essential personnel, explosives storage facilities, and aboveground utilities: (T-1). 12.72.4.1.  Use K105 and provide a personnel shelter that offers adequate overhead and frontal protection capable of defeating all potential fragments.  If no personnel shelter is used,  provide  all  essential  and  non-essential  personnel  protection  IAW  paragraph 12.72.3.  Use AFTO 60A-1-1-4 to determine personnel protection for essential personnel involved in EOD operations. 12.72.4.2.  If the essential personnel protection distance in paragraph 12.72.4.1.  is not available,  construct  a  personnel  shelter  that  provides  equivalent  protection  from  the expected  blast  overpressure  and  fragment  hazards  for  the  types  of  munitions  used.  Obtain shelter design approval per paragraph 12.72.4.7. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 247 12.72.4.3.  On-site authorities, with advice from EOD, designate essential personnel and determine  minimum  distance  for  equipment  and  unoccupied  non-explosives  facilities related to the detonation. 12.72.4.4.  From the detonation area to underground utilities, use K18 with a minimum distance of 100 feet. 12.72.4.5.  Apply  ILD  separation  from  other  PESs  based  on  the  PES’s  NEWQD  to control  sites  used  for  AE  disposals,  live-fire  demonstrations  and  EOD  non-emergency intentional detonations. 12.72.4.6.  Holding Pads.  Separate holding pads for additional shots using aboveground magazine criteria.  Maintain ILD to the destruction point and to the personnel control site based  on  the  NEWQD  of  the  holding  pad.    In  addition,  maintain  IMD  between  each holding pad. 12.72.4.7.  Use shorter distances if equivalent protection is provided.  Forward design and analysis information for equivalent protection to AFSEC/SEW for approval. 12.73.  EOD  Operational  Responses.  EOD  operational  responses  require  the  application  of public withdrawal distances to all non-essential personnel per paragraphs 10.11. and  10.12. 12.74.  EOD Proficiency Training Ranges 12.74.1.  Limit demolition explosives on EOD proficiency training ranges to a maximum of five  lbs.  (T-1).    Use  only  non-fragmenting  charges  (e.g.,  Boot  Banger,  bare  C-4,  Conical Liquid  Follow  Through),  shaped  charges  (e.g.,  Mk  7  series,  Mk  2,  flex  linear),  ordnance penetrators (e.g., Mk 23, Mk 24), explosive powered tools (e.g., Mk-2 dearmer, Percussion Actuated Non-electric Disruptor), and inert mild steel targets on training ranges. (T-1).  Place a minimum of three sand bags in front of explosive penetrators to capture explosively formed penetrators and limit directional forces. (T-1). 12.74.2.  Construct EOD proficiency training range destruction points to control ejection of debris by: 12.74.2.1.  Constructing a barricade with two entrances surrounding the destruction point that is the equivalent of at least two side-to-side sandbags, is at least six feet high, and is constructed within 10 feet of the destruction point. (T-1). 12.74.2.2.  Locating the barricade entrances at 180 degrees separation.  Barricade these entrances, as described above, to effectively block all debris. (T-1). 12.74.3.  Use the following criteria from the destruction point to all aboveground facilities (including PTRs, base boundaries, runways, taxiways, parking aprons and any PES except for associated holding pads as discussed in paragraph 12.74.8. below): (T-1). 12.74.3.1.  If  the  destruction  point  is  at  least  500  feet  from  these  facilities,  limit demolition explosives to five lbs. 12.74.3.2.  If the destruction point is less than 500 feet but 300 feet or more from these facilities, limit demolition explosives to 2.5 lbs. 12.74.3.3.  If the destruction point is less than 300 feet but 200 feet or more from these facilities, limit demolition explosives to 1.25 lbs. 248 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.74.4.  Only use explosively-operated tool kits and explosively-driven IED defeat charges on inert targets at EOD proficiency training ranges. (T-1).  Targets may be “monitored” by non-fragmenting explosive charges that are within parameters of the established range.  The tools, charges, and targets all require 100-foot separation distance from the destruction point to all aboveground facilities.  Barricade the destruction point per paragraph 12.74.2. (T-1). 12.74.4.1.  EOD tools (explosives devices) and inert training devices or targets are non-fragmentation  producing  devices.    They  may  produce  some  debris,  but  should  not  be mistaken  for  fragmentation.    Fragmentation  is  specifically  designed  into  a  weapon  or device; whereas debris is not. 12.74.4.2.  Vehicle-targets  (for  remote-opening  techniques  or  otherwise  checking  for IEDs) on EOD proficiency ranges is standard practice.  EOD teams are allowed to do this type of training on their proficiency ranges. 12.74.5.  Only  permit  Explosively-Driven  Water  Tools  (EDWT)  operations  at  EOD proficiency  training  ranges  provided  the  reduced  QD  given  in  the  next  paragraph  remains within the established QD for that specific range. (T-1). 12.74.5.1.  The approved list of EDWT includes Mineral Water Bottle (MWB), Hydra-Jet, Big Mike, Bottler, Boot Banger, Vantreppan, MLVD, Aqua Ram, and Exit Charge. 12.74.5.2.  EDWT QD is determined using the equation QD = 328xNEW1/3, subject to a 100-foot minimum distance.  When calculating the NEW, do not include the explosive weight of the main charge initiation chain (i.e., blasting caps, detonation cord, time fuze, shock  tube,  etc.).    However,  some  EDWT  use  the  detonation  cord  as  the  main  water-propulsion  charge,  and  in  those  cases,  consider  the  NEW  of  that  detonation  cord  in determining EDWT NEW and appropriate QD. 12.74.6.  On-site  authorities  determine  the  minimum  separation  distance  for  essential personnel. 12.74.7.  EOD proficiency training ranges used with other than bare charges or non-fragment producing items will meet the requirements of paragraph 12.72. (T-1).  If using the training range for operations that will produce fragments above the level expected for normal EOD proficiency training (normally open shots), meet the requirements of paragraph 12.72. (T-1). 12.74.8.  If the proficiency training range is located on an existing disposal range and meets the 500-foot separation distance from the detonation point to the perimeter of the disposal range IAW the requirements listed in AFI 32-3001, then barricades identified in paragraph 12.74.2. are not required. 12.74.9.  Holding pads.  Site holding pads for additional training shots using AGM criteria.     (T-1).    Maintain  ILD  to  the  destruction  point  and  to  the  personnel  control  site.  (T-1).    In addition, maintain IMD between each holding pad. (T-1). 12.74.10.  Locate control sites and detonation points at PTRD from all other PESs. (T-1).   AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 249 12.75.  EOD  Training  at  Off-Range  Locations  and  Outside  Agency  Collaboration Activities. 12.75.1.  EOD personnel may use procedures with explosively propelled liquids, shots, gases, slugs,  or  heat  against  inert  training  munitions  and  soft  targets  at  off-range  locations  on military installations in support of unit training, inspections, and evaluations. 12.75.2.  EOD  teams  may  use    MK  1  Remote  Wrenches,  MK  2  .50  de-Armers,  Field Fabricated  de-Armers,  Robotic  Vehicles,  Stand-off  Disrupters,  Stand-off  De-Armers, Percussion Actuated Neutralizers (PAN), and Carbon 10 Disrupters for training. 12.75.3.  Use  EOD  60-series  or  applicable  publications  to  calculate  appropriate  standoff distances  for  EOD  training  and  operations  at  off-range  locations.  (T-1).    Use  only  the explosives  items  listed  below  for  off-range  unit  training,  inspection  and  evaluation operations: (T-1). 12.75.3.1.  Two .50 caliber impulse cartridges. 12.75.3.2.

Note:  Quantities listed here are the maximums authorized for each inspection or evaluation scenario. 12.75.4.  Under the following conditions, EOD personnel may conduct off-range operations using the tools and explosives described in paragraphs 12.75.2. and  12.75.3. 12.75.4.1.  Notify  installation  weapons  safety  office  with  the  specific  location,  prior  to the operation. (T-1). 12.75.4.2.  Make proper notifications concerning anticipated noise. (T-1). 12.75.4.3.  Do not locate the operation in an explosives prohibited zone. (T-1). 12.75.4.4.  Evacuate  non-essential  personnel  to  the  applicable  withdrawal  distances required for an actual situation. (T-1). 12.75.4.5.  Place  a  minimum  of  three  filled  sand  bags  in  front  and  behind  tools  that project slugs, fluids or shot to limit directional force unless fired from the robot. (T-1).  Tools fired from robots only require three filled sand bags in front of the tool. 12.75.4.6.  Use only slugs made of plaster that disintegrate on impact. (T-1). 250 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.75.4.7.  Select an area free of all fire hazards and use only inert training ordnance or IED concealment devices as a target (see paragraph 12.74.4.). 12.75.4.8.  When operating tool sets inside a building, take positive measures to prevent secondary or collateral damage. (T-1). 12.75.5.  EOD  Training  off-range  at  off-base  (law  enforcement  or  international  partner operated)  locations  with  local,  state  and  federal  agencies  or  other  international  partners.  Under  the  auspices  of  DoD  Directives  3025.18,  Defense  Support  to  Civil  Authorities  and 1100.20, Support and Services for Eligible Organizations and Activities Outside the DoD, provide this guidance to facilitate open discussions and training for “Immediate Response” situations  involving  the  mitigation  of  IED  or  military  munitions.    In  these  situations,  the following minimum requirements apply: 12.75.5.1.  EOD  Leadership  will  complete  a  risk  assessment  of  the  lesson  plans  and training  area  to  ensure  all  Air  Force  explosives  safety  standards  have  been  addressed and/or mitigated. (T-1). As a minimum, coordinate these items with SEW, JA, and PA. 12.75.5.2.  Obtain  approval  of  an  official  participation  request  from  the  installation Commander  or  designated  representative.  (T-1).    Include  risk  assessment,  training objectives, time, place, Hazard Division of explosives used, method of initiation, and any other  performance  factors  from  the  hosting  local,  state  and  federal  agency  or  other international partners in the request. 12.75.5.3.  The EOD Team Leader or designated representative will maintain EOD team integrity and ensure personnel safety at civil law enforcement operated locations. (T-1). 12.75.6.  EOD  Training  On-Base  with  local,  State  and  Federal  agencies.    Limit  on-base training with local, state and federal agencies or other international partners to participation of EOD procedures. 12.75.6.1.  The appropriate essential or non-essential personnel principles will be applied during  explosive  demonstrations.    Conversely,  training  with  civil  law  enforcement explosives  are  not  authorized  for  detonation  on  base  unless  their  munitions  meet established DoD standards and the requirements of paragraph 7.26. 12.75.6.2.  Obtain  approval  of  an  official  participation  request  from  the  installation Commander or designated representative. (T-1).  Include training objectives, time, place, Hazard Division, method of initiation, and any other performance factors. 12.76.  Training  in  Explosives  Entry  Techniques.  Explosives  entry  techniques  are  used  in special missions where assault personnel require immediate access to the target.  Siting is not required  for the  expected blast/fragmentation  effects  does  not  exceed  existing  range  surface  danger  zones  as  defined  in AFI 13-212.  Site all explosives entry techniques training locations that are not managed per AFI 13-212. (T-1). in  explosives  entry training techniques  at loctions  where 12.76.1.  Essential  personnel  MSD.    Use  approved  explosives  entry  techniques  technical procedures to determine personnel protection for essential personnel involved in explosive entry technique training. 12.76.2.  Non-essential Personnel MSD.  The MSD for non-essential personnel is K328 with a minimum distance of 200 feet.  The 200 foot minimum distance can be eliminated when a AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 251 protective barrier is provided that can contain, or absorb all fragments (this may include the training structure itself when breaching into the interior of the structure). 12.77.  Military  Working  Dog  (MWD)  Explosives  Search  Training.  Training  of  MWD involves  searches  to  detect  explosives  that  have  been  hidden  in  various  public  places.    These training operations typically include handling explosives, cutting or dividing explosive training aids, removing explosives from shipping and storage containers, and repackaging explosives into other containers.  For these reasons, training operations will: (T-1). 12.77.1.  Be conducted by qualified personnel. 12.77.2.  Be conducted in facilities that meet the requirements of this Manual. 12.77.3.  Store explosives in facilities that meet the requirements of this Manual. 12.77.4.  Provide non-essential personnel a K40 separation distance from the training site if more than 15 lbs NEWQD is being used for the exercise and a 100 foot separation distance from the training site if less than or equal to15 lbs NEWQD is being used. 12.77.5.  Minimize the number of samples and the quantity of explosives for each sample.  On-site  authorities  will  determine  the  total  quantity  of  explosives  permitted  during  an exercise considering: 12.77.5.1.  The value and importance of the exposed facilities. 12.77.5.2.  The exercise operating conditions. 12.77.5.3.  The available separation distance for non-essential personnel. 12.77.6.  Separate  samples  a  sufficient  distance  apart  to  prevent  an  explosion  from propagating from one sample to another. 12.77.7.  Not use any initiating devices or initiating explosives. 12.77.8.  Not place explosives near any heat or spark producing items (e.g., bare electrical wiring, radiators, electric heaters, heating vents, etc.). 12.77.9.  Not place explosives in metal containers or other means of confinement that could produce fragments in the event of an accidental explosion. 12.78.  Demilitarization  Operations  for  Expended  .50-Caliber  and  Smaller  Cartridge Casings. 12.78.1.  Treat a demilitarization operation for processing expended .50-caliber and smaller cartridge cases as a non-explosive operation provided: (T-1). 12.78.1.1.  Cartridge casings to be processed are screened prior to processing. Note:  Screening is intended to ensure that only .50-caliber and smaller cartridges are processed, and to remove unused .50-caliber and smaller cartridges. 12.78.1.2.  Demilitarization  processing  equipment  is  tested  to  be  capable  of  containing overpressure,  fragment,  and  thermal  hazards  associated  with  a  worst-case  reaction involving a single live round of the most energetic cartridge that could be processed in the equipment. 252 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.78.1.3.  Demilitarization processing equipment is operated within the  manufacturer's specifications and restricted only to the processing of expended .50-caliber and smaller cartridge casings. 12.78.1.4.  Demilitarization processing equipment is inspected and maintained to ensure safe operation. 12.78.2.  MAJCOMs will: 12.78.2.1.  Approve the use of specific demilitarization processing equipment. 12.78.2.2.  Establish and implement procedures for: 12.78.2.2.1.  Screening and segregating the material to be processed. 12.78.2.2.2.  Operating,  inspecting,  and  maintaining  the  demilitarization  processing equipment to ensure safe operation. 12.78.2.2.3.  Dispositioning of processed material. 12.78.3.  Demilitarization  processing  operation  locations  meeting  the  requirements  of paragraphs 12.78.1. and  12.78.2. do not require siting as a PES.  As an ES, locate at ILD from all PESs, except from the PES where it is integral. 12.79.  POL and Other Hazardous Materials. 12.79.1.  Separate  unprotected,  aboveground  bulk  storage  tanks  (>  5,000  gallons)  for hazardous  materials  (e.g.,  POL,  liquid  petroleum)  from  all  PESs  by  IBD.  (T-1).    A  dike system satisfying NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers is required. (T-1).    Site  aboveground  storage  tanks,  that  are  provided  protection  against  rupture  or collapse from blast and fragment hazards, at lesser distances when supported by testing or analysis. (T-1). 12.79.2.  Separate  smaller  unprotected,  aboveground  bulk  storage  tanks  (<  5,000  gallons) from all PESs IAW paragraph 12.79.1. (T-1).  When these criteria cannot be met, weigh the cost of distance or protective construction against the strategic value of the stored material, the ease of replacement in the event of an accident, and the potential environmental impact.  Approve  reduced  distances  if  the  responsible  Commander  accepts  the  possible  loss  of  the tanks  and  any  collateral  damage  that  a  fire  might  cause  as  a  result  of  the  tanks  being punctured by fragments. (T-1). 12.79.3.  Separate  railroad  tank  car  and  transfer  points  or  operations,  tank  trucks,  POL transmission  pipelines,  and  hydrants  from  all  PESs  by  IBD.  (T-1).    Separate  fuel  truck transfer points or operations by PTRD, with no minimum fragment distance, if the trucks are limited to less than 48 hours at the location. (T-1). 12.79.4.  Site  unprotected,  aboveground  service  tanks  ,  to  include  fuel  bladders,  solely supporting AE storage or operating complexes that are supplied by a pipe system designed to resist  blast  and  fragments  at  incremental  IBD  with  a  minimum  distance  of  400  feet  from supported PESs provided: (T-1). 12.79.4.1.  Equip aboveground lines, if used, with automatic shut-off valves at the source. 12.79.4.2.  A dike system meeting the requirements of NFPA 430 is provided. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 253 12.79.4.3.  Responsible  Commander  accepts  the  possible  loss  of  the  tanks  and  any collateral  damage  that  a  fire  might  cause  as  a  result  of  the  tanks  being  punctured  by fragments. (T-1). 12.79.5.  A service tank (above or below ground) supporting a single PES or ES within an explosive clear zone does not require QD but will comply with NFPA 30. (T-1). 12.79.6.  Small quantities of POL or other hazardous materials used for operational purposes require  no  specific  separation  distance  for  explosives  safety;  however,  separate  these materials as required by NFPA 30 or 50’, whichever is greater. (T-1).  An example of this facility type would be small lockers used to store operational quantities of POL and other flammable materials in support of a single PES/ES.  Implement operating procedures to limit adverse environmental impacts in the event of an accidental explosion. (T-1).  This criteria does not apply to small daily use storage lockers located in operating environments. 12.79.7.  Separate parking areas for fuel service trucks by ILD with a minimum of 100 feet from related PESs, and IBD from unrelated PESs. (T-1). 12.79.8.  Site fixed refueling points at ILD with a 100-foot minimum from all related PESs (e.g., a remote, unmanned self-service station commonly located in a MSAs and flightline AGE shop). (T-1). 12.79.9.  There  must  be  at  least  100  feet  between  explosives  and  any  mobile  petroleum dispensing unit operating in  an  explosives area, except where  a shorter  distance is needed during  transfer  operations  to  an  underground  tank  located  at  less  than  100  feet  or  where needed to refuel a mobile explosives transporter (such as the environmental control unit for the LGM-30) with the explosives load aboard. 12.79.10.  Separate buried tanks and buried pipelines from all PESs containing HD 1.2, HD 1.3, HD 1.4, or HD 1.6 AE by at least 80 feet. (T-1).  The required separation distance for HD 1.1 or HD 1.5 AE is K3 with a minimum distance of 80 feet. (T-1).  Keep pumps and pump houses serving underground POL at least 50 feet from all PESs. (T-1).  If the PES is designed to contain the effects of an explosion, then no QD is required. 12.79.11.  Consider cut and cover POL tanks as underground if they have at least three feet of earth cover (five feet is recommended if the PES exposing the tank could generate large secondary  debris  fragments)  are  sited  at  K3.    Unmanned  cut  and  cover  support  facilities require ILD from all PES’s. (T-1). 12.79.12.  Exempt the following from QD requirements: 12.79.12.1.  Explosives loaded aircraft to POL hydrants set on the flightline flush with the pavement. 12.79.12.2.  AE to in use material-handling equipment. 12.79.12.3.

Site  aboveground storage  tanks,  that  are  provided  protection  against  rupture  or  collapse  from  blast  and fragment hazards, at lesser distances when supported by testing or analysis. (T-1). 254 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.80.2.  QD  criteria  do  not  apply  to  storage  tanks  and  associated  components  if  loss  is acceptable to the responsible Commander. 12.81.  Underground  Tanks  or  Pipelines for  Water  and  Other  Non-Hazardous Materials.  Underground  tanks  or  pipelines  for  non-hazardous  materials  whose  loss  is unacceptable, will meet the siting requirements of paragraph 12.79.10. (T-1).  QD criteria do not apply if loss is acceptable to the responsible Commander. 12.82.  Utilities and Services. 12.82.1.  Utilities include steam, water, natural gas, POL lines, sewage, air lines, electrical lines,  communication  lines,  and  environmental  facilities  or  equipment.    The  term  “utility” does not apply to services provided to individual or grouped explosives facilities when that service is not also secondarily provided to other parts of the installation or community.  The following requirements apply to utilities: 12.82.1.1.  Do  not  locate  aboveground  electric  distribution  lines  carrying  less  than  69 kilovolt  (kV),  the  tower  or  poles  supporting  those  lines,  communication  lines,  and unmanned electrical substations closer to PESs than PTRD, with no minimum fragment distance. (T-1). 12.82.1.2.  Do not locate aboveground electric transmission lines carrying 69 kV or more and the tower or poles supporting them closer to PESs than: (T-1). 12.82.1.2.1.  IBD, with no minimum fragment distance, if the line in question is part of a grid system serving a large off-base area. 12.82.1.2.2.  PTRD, with no minimum fragment distance, if loss of the line will not create serious social or economic hardships. transmission/distribution 12.82.1.3.  Separate  aboveground  electric lines  can  be interrupted  without  loss  of  power  (i.e.,  power  is  rerouted  through  existing  lines  or networks) from explosives sites IAW paragraph 12.82.2. 12.82.1.4.  Do  not  locate  utilities  that  provide  vital  functions  to  a  major  portion  of  an installation closer to PESs than IBD. 12.82.1.5.  Do  not  locate  power  and  utilities  functions,  including  power  plants, compressor stations, and electric power transformers that serve an entire base complex;  or when loss of the facility will cause an immediate loss of vital function, closer to PESs than IBD. (T-1). 12.82.1.6.  Site underground electrical and communications lines at K3 with no minimum distance required. (T-1).  Other underground utilities will meet the siting requirements of paragraph 12.79.10. (T-1). 12.82.2.  Do not locate overhead electric service lines (running past an explosives facility but not serving it) closer to a combustible explosives facility or to an open  explosives facility than the length of the electric lines between the nearest service poles and the length of the nearest service pole.  An exception is when an effective means (e.g., line spacers, weights, etc.) is provided to ensure that energized lines on breaking cannot come into contact with the facility or its appurtenances.  No separation is required for non-combustible facilities. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 255 12.82.3.  Locate  manned  auxiliary  services,  including  auxiliary  power  plants,  compressor stations, and electric power transformers, at ILD from PESs they support. (T-1). 12.82.4.  Locate unmanned auxiliary services (e.g., transformer stations, water treatment and pollution abatement facilities) that serve an explosives area, but are not an integral function in the explosives area, and that would not create an immediate secondary hazard if lost, at barricaded  ILD  from  the  PESs  they  support,  even  though  such  services  need  not  be barricaded. (T-1). 12.82.5.  Locate unmanned auxiliary service power generation or conversion facilities (e.g., power  plants,  transformers,  etc.)  that  exclusively  supply  power  to  an  explosives  area  or security fence lighting at fire protection distance (50 feet for non-combustible ES structures, 100 feet for combustible ES structures) from all PESs in the supported explosives area. (T-1). 12.82.6.  Locate  unmanned  aboveground  utility  services  (e.g.,  water  treatment,  pollution abatement  facilities,  water  pump  stations,  sewage  lift  stations,  etc.)  that  do  not  serve  an explosives area or an entire base complex, and when loss will not cause an immediate loss of a vital function at IBD with no minimum fragment distance. (T-1). 12.82.7.  See paragraph 5.9. for design requirements for electrical lines serving a PES. 12.82.8.  Renewable Energy Projects.  Do not locate equipment installed for the purpose of generating renewable  energy, such  as wind turbines and solar panel farms, closer to PESs than  PTRD.  (T-1).    In  addition,  associated  power  lines  must  meet  the  requirements  of paragraph 12.82.1. and associated inhabited structures and be no closer than IBD. (T-1). 12.82.8.1.  Submitted ESPs must identify the energy customer and the equipment owner (e.g., USAF, commercial power company) and include a risk acknowledgement from the equipment owner for potential damage to equipment and power disruption in the event of an explosives accident. (T-1). 12.82.8.2.  These requirements do not apply to individual solar generated power units for lighting,  security  systems  and  building  energy  reduction  systems  within  explosives storage or operating areas provided the electrical requirements contained in Chapter 5 are met and approved by civil engineering. 12.82.8.3.  This equipment must have a full EMR assessment IAW AFI 91-208. (T-1). 12.83.  LGM-30 (Minuteman).  Use Table 12.27. to determine HE equivalency for the LGM-30 missile when calculating QD separations. 12.83.1.  Calculate NEWQD for motor sets (Stages I, II, and III), assembled or unassembled, with HD 1.1 material, on HD 1.1 equivalency basis unless the HD 1.3 hazard is greater. (T-1). 12.83.2.  When only HD 1.3 motors are present, use total NEWQD of the motors, and apply HD 1.3 QD criteria. (T-1).  For LGM-30G motors use HD 1.3 QD criteria for shipping and storage purposes. (T-1).  When a warhead is added to the assembled set, the 7,400-lb HE equivalency applies.  Safety distances are based on 7,400 lbs HD 1.1 HE equivalency for all LGM-30 missile motor sets (models A through G) with or without a warhead installed.  The IBD zone based on 7,400 lbs HD 1.1 is 1,200 feet measured from the center of the launch facility silo. 256 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.83.3.  Separations for aircraft loading and unloading sites for solid propellant motors in shipping and storage containers, Storage, Shipping Container Ballistic Missile (SSCBM) and Payload Transporter Container:  IBD is 1,200 feet (includes missile holding pads, facilities, aircraft or other equipment essential to the mission of the base);  PTRD is 720 feet. 12.83.4.  Aircraft Loading and Unloading Sites.  When an aircraft loaded with these motors must be refueled, a fully staffed firefighting truck will be on standby at the aircraft during fueling operations. (T-1). 12.83.5.  Railroad  Loading  and  Unloading  Sites.    Criteria  in  paragraph  8.54.  apply  to railroad  loading  and  unloading  sites  for  Minuteman  missile  motors  in  the  SSCBM  and missile transporters shipped by the “piggyback” method. 12.83.6.  Missile  Alert  Facility  (MAF).   Explosives-loaded  vehicles  (e.g.,  payload transporter, reentry vehicle guidance and control van, transporter erector) may be temporarily parked at the MAF, subject to the following controls: 12.83.6.1.  The  wing  or  installation  Commander  or  his  designated  representative  must approve each instance. (T-1). 12.83.6.2.  Allow  parking,  if  needed,  for  severe  weather,  equipment  breakdown  and repair,  crew  rest,  darkness  (where  state  law  prohibits  vehicle  travel  on  highways  after dark) or other emergency conditions. 12.83.6.3.  No smoking outside missile alert facility support buildings. 12.83.6.4.  Park only one explosives-loaded vehicle. 12.83.6.5.  Publish a detailed operating instruction of safety precautions and controls. 12.83.6.6.  Ensure required security is maintained. 12.84.  LGM-118  (Peacekeeper).  Use Table 12.30. to determine high explosives equivalency for the LGM-118 missile when calculating QD separations. (T-1). 12.84.1.  Peacekeeper Separation.  General explosives safety standards and QD criteria apply to the Peacekeeper except as follows:  when stages 1, 2, and 3 are assembled at other than a silo  launch  facility  (with  or  without  stage  4  warheads  being  attached),  the  net  explosives equivalency for the missile is 203,412 lbs (HD 1.1). 12.84.2.  When the missile is in a silo launch facility or during missile installation or removal from the silo, the net explosives equivalency is 20,000 lbs (HD 1.1).  Use this equivalency only for calculating IMD and ILD separations, and for use in risk assessments based on blast overpressure.  Applicable distance for PTRD is 1,050 feet and for IBD is 1,750 feet. 12.85.  Inter-DoD Component Support and Tactical Facilities. 12.85.1.  General. 12.85.1.1.  Apply  the  separation  distances  in  paragraph  12.85.2.  between  facilities  of one DoD Component to those of another DoD Component regardless of the location of the boundaries.  (T-1). 12.85.1.2.  Other safety criteria (e.g., toxicity, noise, radiation, flight trajectory, etc.) may require greater distances.  In these situations, the predominant hazard criteria apply. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 257 12.85.2.  The following minimum QD relationships apply: (T-1). 12.85.2.1.  Separate AE storage facilities by IMD. (T-1). 12.85.2.2.  Separate AE storage or operating locations of one DoD Component from AE operating locations of another DoD Component by IBD (See paragraph 12.85.2.3. for an exception to this criteria.). (T-1). 12.85.2.3.  Separate  explosive  operations  that  present  a  similar  degree  of  hazard  or involve joint or support operations by ILD. (T-1). 12.85.2.4.  Separate AE storage or operating locations of one DoD Component from AE tactical  facilities  of  another  DoD  Component  by  IBD.  (T-1).    For  joint  or  support operations,  determine  the  separation  distance  as  though  both  facilities  belonged  to  a single DoD Component. 12.86.  Criteria for non-DoD Explosives Activities on DoD Installations. 12.86.1.  Conduct  only  non-DoD  explosives  activities  on  DoD  property  per  Table  12.31.  These  non-DoD  explosives  activities  must  also  comply  with  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and other Federal, State, and local  regulations.    Definitions  for  the  terminology  used  in  Table  12.31.  can  be  found  in Attachment 1. 12.86.2.  For  these  types  of  non-DoD  explosives  activities,  DoD  is  only  responsible  for ensuring that IMD requirements, as outlined in ESP submissions, are met.  DoD oversight of these non-DoD explosives activities is not intended. 12.86.3.  Evaluate non-DoD, explosives activities based on IMD between multiple PESs to ensure non-propagation. (T-1).  Where IMD is not met, add non-DoD explosives activity's sites to determine the applicable IMD or IBD to DoD sites. 12.86.4.  In Table 12.31., “Check for IMD” means if IMD is not maintained between each PES, total all explosives quantities. 12.86.5.  Determine IBD based on the requirements in this Manual. 12.86.6.  Limit DoD site approval for non-DoD explosives activities to the area encumbered by the IBD arcs. 12.86.7.  Review  of  building  design,  LPS,  etc.,  is  not  necessary  unless  design  features  are used as justification to reduce the IBD arc. 12.87.  Basic  Load  Ammunition  Holding  Area/Ammunition  Holding  Area  Criteria (BLAHA/AHA). 12.87.1.  BLAHA/AHA Introduction.  To fulfill their missions, certain units must keep their basic load ammunition in armored vehicles, trucks, trailers, and structures or on pads.  This involves  an  acceptance  of  greater  risks  to  unit  personnel,  facilities,  and  equipment  than permitted by other parts of this Manual.  Storage compatibility requirements of Section 7J apply to BLAHA/AHA operations: 12.87.2.  NEWQD computations must be IAW Section 12C. (T-1). 258 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.87.2.1.  The  maximum  NEWQD  at  any  BLAHA/AHA  cell  storing  mixed compatibility  must  not  exceed  8,818lbs.  (T-1).    A  BLAHA/AHA  may  have  multiple 8,818-lb  cells,  provided  the  cells  are  separated  from  each  other  by  the  applicable distances (D1, D2, and D3) given in Table 12.35. and Chapter 8. 12.87.2.2.  When  the  NEWQD  of  a  BLAHA/AHA  cell  exceeds  8,818lbs,  the  QD computations for the site must be IAW Chapter 12, the HD mixing rules must be IAW Section 12C, and the explosives compatibility storage criteria must be IAW Section 7J. (T-1). 12.87.3.  QD Computations. 12.87.3.1.  Use the total NEWQD of AE in each cell for computation of QD provided the required distances of Table 12.35. are met, to prevent prompt propagation between cells. (T-1). If the 8,818lbs NEWQD limit or required separation distances are not met, then the entire BLAHA/AHA must be considered one site and paragraph 12.87.2.2. applies. 12.87.3.2.  Table 12.35.  provides the QD requirements for BLAHA/AHAs. 12.87.3.3.  Use Table 12.34. to determine the applicable QD for heavy, light, and non-armored vehicles, as described in paragraph 12.87.4. below. (T-1).  ILD requirements are given in Note g. of Table 12.35. 12.87.4.  AE Loaded Vehicles.  For the purposes of BLAHA criteria, treat combat vehicles as heavy armored, light armored, or non-armored. 12.87.4.1.  Heavy Armored Vehicles (e.g., M1 Abrams Tank). 12.87.4.1.1.  A heavy armored vehicle is expected to contain the fragments from an internal explosion involving the munitions stored within it, so QD is based on blast impulse  only.    Consider  it  well  protected  against  the  explosion  effects  from  an external explosion. 12.87.4.1.2.  For  the  reasons  above,  a  heavy  armored  vehicle  has  no  magazine distance and requires no separation from other heavy, light-armored, or non-armored vehicles.  However, the hatches of a heavy armored vehicle are required to be closed, otherwise the vehicle must be treated as light armored. 12.87.4.1.3.  All  munitions  must  be  contained  within the  on-board  storage compartments, otherwise the heavy armored vehicle must be treated as non-armored as a PES. (T-1). 12.87.4.2.  Light Armored Vehicles (e.g., M109 howitzer, FAASV. MJ13 mortar tracks, M2/M3 Bradley fighting vehicle, MRAP). 12.87.4.2.1.  Do not expect a light armored vehicle to contain the explosion effects from  an  internal  explosion  involving  the  munitions  stored  within  it,  however,  the munitions and vehicle will generate fragments.  Expect the vehicle's structure/armor will either stop primary fragments or significantly reduce fragment velocities from an external  munitions  explosion.    Therefore,  base  QD  for  a  light  armored  vehicle  on blast, fragments, and vehicle debris. 12.87.4.2.2.  A light armored vehicle provides protection from an external blast and fragments/debris. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 259 12.87.4.2.3.  For the above reasons, treat a light armored vehicle as a barricaded ES and as an un-barricaded PES. (T-1). 12.87.4.2.4.  Require the hatches and ramps to be closed, otherwise treat the vehicle as non-armored. 12.87.4.2.5.  All munitions must be contained within the light armored vehicle (e.g., no external carry munitions) for it to be considered as a barricaded ES, otherwise treat the vehicle as non-armored. (T-1). 12.87.4.3.  Non-armored  vehicles  (e.g.,  HUMMWV,  trailer).    Non-armored  vehicles provide no protection from an internal/external explosion. 12.88.  Piers and Wharfs. 12.88.1.  Scope and Application.  QDs herein are for HD 1.1 AE.  If only AE of other HDs are involved, apply the appropriate QD.  This applies to: 12.88.1.1.  Ship and barge units, hereafter referred to as ships. 12.88.1.2.  Piers, wharfs, and associated facilities where AE may be handled or may be present in ships’ holds or conveyances. 12.88.1.3.  Loading, off-loading, stowing, and shifting of AE from ships’ magazines. 12.88.2.  Determining the Quantity of Explosives in a Ship. 12.88.2.1.  Determine the NEWQD on board a ship per Section 12C. (T-1). 12.88.2.2.  When  ships  are  separated  by  11W1/3  distances  or  greater,  base  the  QD individually on the quantity of each ship. (T-1).  Lesser separation distances require that the AE in all ships be totaled. 12.88.3.  Measurement of Separation Distances. 12.88.3.1.  Moored Ships. 12.88.3.1.1.  Measurement  of  separation  distances  between  ships  or  barges  must  be from the nearest point of one ship’s magazine (i.e., the PES) or the barge: (T-1). 12.88.3.1.1.1.  For  IMD,  to  the  nearest  point  of  another  ship’s  magazine  or  a barge. 12.88.3.1.1.2.  For IBD and PTRD, to the nearest point of another ship or a barge. 12.88.3.1.2.  Measurement of separation distances between ships or barges and shore ESs must be from the nearest point of a ship’s magazine or the barge to the nearest point of the ES. (T-1). 12.88.3.2.  Pier  Operations.    Measurement  of  separation  distances  from  piers  to surrounding facilities must be from the nearest  point that AE is handled to the nearest point of an ES. (T-1). Consider movement of railcars or trucks passing through the clear space  between  ships  at  a  pier  or  between  piers  an  operational  risk.    It  is  generally impracticable  to  separate  berths  at  a  single  pier  by  enough  distance  to  prevent  mass detonation of HD 1.1.  To the extent operationally feasible, reduce the number of such exposures and total time required to the maximum extent practicable through scheduling. 260 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.88.3.3.  Anchorages.    Measurements  from  anchorages  generally  must  be  from  the boundary of the area designated for the explosives anchorage.  The explosives anchorage for a single ship is a  circle, the radius being the distance from the mooring buoy  or  a ship’s anchor to the stern of the ship or of the AE lighters alongside when riding to the full scope of the chain.  For an explosives anchorage, the separation distance to an ES depends upon whether any ships are separated properly (see paragraph 12.88.2.2.).  12.88.4.  Siting Criteria and Application of QD. 12.88.4.1.  Maritime Pre-positioning Ships (MPSs). 12.88.4.1.1.  Apply reduced QD criteria to those MPSs that contain up to 1,300,000 lbs  NEWQD  of  AE  stored  in  standard  International  Standardization  Organization (ISO) shipping containers. (T-1). 12.88.4.1.2.  Determine IBD and PTRD for MPSs using K = 40.85 with a 3,700-foot minimum  fragment  distance  for  IBD  and  K  =  24.01  with  a  2,220-foot  minimum fragment  distance  for  PTRD  for  MPS  loads  where  no  more  than  52  percent  of  the NEWQD is HD 1.1. (T-1).  When the percentage of HD 1.1 is: 12.88.4.1.2.1.  Between  52  and  65  percent,  use  the  IBD  and  PTRD  columns  of Table 12.36. 12.88.4.1.2.2.  Above 65 percent, use the Other PES columns of Table 12.6. with a  3,700  foot  minimum  fragment  distance  for  IBD  and  a  2,220  foot  minimum fragment distance for PTRD. 12.88.4.1.3.  Determine the QD between applicable MPS piers/anchorages and non-explosives  loading  piers/anchorages  using  K  =  32  with  a  3,500  foot  minimum fragment  distance  for  MPS  loads,  where  no  more  than  52  percent  of  the  total NEWQD  is  HD  1.1.  (An  exception  for  non-explosive  MPSs  is  provided  in paragraph 12.88.4.8.1.). (T-1).  When the percentage of HD 1.1 is: 12.88.4.1.3.1.  Between 52 and 65 percent, use the ship-to-ship column in Table 12.36. 12.88.4.1.3.2.  Above 65 percent, use K = 40 [15.87] with a minimum fragment distance of 3,500 feet. 12.88.4.2.  Scuttling  Site.    A  properly  located  scuttling  site  will,  when  feasible,  be provided for positioning a ship for its flooding or sinking in the event it catches fire and must be moved to avert damage to other ships or piers.  The location of a scuttling site depends on the greatest NEWQD that may be in a single ship to be scuttled at any one time  (Figure  12.9.  provides  the  applicable  QD).    Additional  considerations  for  the scuttling site include: 12.88.4.2.1.  Sufficient  maneuvering  room  and  depth  to  permit  sinking  the  largest vessel  that  may  be  handled  at  the  installation  so  that  the  holds  will  be  flooded completely at low tide. 12.88.4.2.2.  Providing  the  best  available  protection  to  other  ships,  piers,  and  shore installations in the event of a mass explosion. 12.88.4.3.  Explosives Anchorages. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 261 12.88.4.3.1.  Separation  of  Explosives  Anchorages  from  Main  Ship  Channels.  Separate  explosives  anchorage  from  the  main  ship  channel  and  from  normally traversed  routes  of  ships  entering  or  leaving  the  harbor  by  the  following  distances (occasional  watercraft  passing  through  the  arcs,  while  outside  both  the  main  ship channel and normally traversed routes of ships entering and leaving the harbor, are not subject to QD requirements): (T-1). 12.88.4.3.1.1.  The PTRD from “Other PES” column of Table 12.6. (regardless of traffic density). 12.88.4.3.1.2.  The turning  circles and stopping  distances of other ships  passing the anchorage but not less than 3,000 feet. 12.88.4.3.2.  Separation  of  Ships  at  Explosives  Anchorages.    When  explosives anchorages  are  used  for  both  loading  and  unloading  ships  and  for  mooring  loaded ships, separate ships as follows: (T-1). 12.88.4.3.2.1.  Separate loaded ships from each other by 18W1/3. 12.88.4.3.2.2.  Separate loading  and unloading ships from each other by  11W1/3 and, when possible, by 18W1/3. 12.88.4.3.2.3.  Separate loaded ships from ships loading and unloading by 40W1/3. 12.88.4.3.3.  Separation of Explosives Anchorages from Explosives Piers.  Separate explosives anchorages from explosives piers by 40W1/3 except when the anchorage is used only for the loading or unloading of ships.  In that case, 18W1/3 may be used. 12.88.4.4.  Separation Distances of Ships at the Same Pier. 12.88.4.4.1.  Berthing of two ships in tandem helps decrease the fragment hazard to the AE cargo of the second ship because of the additional protection afforded by the bow or stern. 12.88.4.4.2.  When two ships cannot be separated by 11W1/3 and are loaded through all hatches at the same time, plan the spotting of railcars or trucks and the loading of hatches in both ships in a manner that puts the greatest possible distance both between the open hatches and the trucks and railcars serving the two ships.  When possible, stagger the loading of the all ships. 12.88.4.5.  Separation of Wharf Yard from the Pier.  Separate a wharf yard from the pier it serves by 11W1/3 to prevent propagation. (T-1).  If this separation distance cannot be met,  then  consider  the  wharf  yard  as  part  of  the  ship  or  barge  and  add  to  it  for computation of the total amount of explosives for QD purposes. 12.88.4.6.  Separation of Explosives Ships from Other Ships.  Separate explosives ships being loaded or unloaded from non-explosives carrying ships and from loaded explosives ships that are not underway by 40W1/3 distances. (T-1).  Use the PTRD from “Other PES” column of Table 12.6. for protection of ships that are underway. 12.88.4.7.  Barge Piers and Anchorages. 12.88.4.7.1.  Barge  Piers.    Site  piers  and  wharfs,  used  exclusively  for  loading  or unloading AE on barges or utility craft (i.e., barge piers), at IMD from all other PESs 262 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 (to  include  from  another  barge  pier  or  a  barge  anchorage).  (T-1).    As  a  PES,  site barge piers and anchorages IAW Figure 12.9. 12.88.4.7.2.  Barge  Anchorages.    Site  anchorages  used  only  to  moor  AE-loaded barges and where AE loading or unloading is not permitted (i.e., barge anchorages) at IMD from all other PESs (to include from another barge anchorage or a barge pier). (T-1).  As a PES, site barge anchorages IAW Figure 12.9.  See paragraph 12.88.4.3. for criteria to apply to anchorages used for AE loading or unloading. 12.88.4.8.  Separation of Pre-position Program Ships at Anchorages.  The Military Sealift Command’s Pre-positioning Program (i.e., Combat Pre-positioning Force, Maritime Pre-positioning Force, Logistics Pre-positioning Ships) operates both explosives-loaded and non-explosives carrying ships that are then deployed to key locations around the world.  These  ships  are  pre-loaded  with  military  equipment  and  supplies  necessary  to  support military  forces  on  a  short-notice  basis  and  thus  support  a  common  mission.    The following criteria apply to Pre-positioning Program ships at anchorage: 12.88.4.8.1.  Separate non-explosives carrying ships from explosives-loaded ships by a minimum of 18W1/3. (T-1). 12.88.4.8.2.  Separate  non-explosives  carrying  ships  from  non-pre-positioning program explosives-loaded ships by 40W1/3. (T-1). 12.88.4.8.3.  Non-explosives  carrying  ships  not  associated  with  the  Pre-positioning Program shall be separated from all explosives carrying ships by 40W1/3. (T-1). 12.88.4.8.4.  Separate all non-explosives carrying ships from explosives ships being loaded or unloaded by 40W1/3. (T-1). 12.88.5.  QD Tables. 12.88.5.1.  Figure 12.9.  illustrates required hazard factors. 12.88.5.2.  Maintain Table 12.6. separation distances between explosives pier and wharf facilities  and  other  ESs  (e.g.,  administration  and  industrial  areas,  terminal  boundaries, main ship channels, and PTR). 12.88.5.3.  As an ES, separate ships from AE operating and storage facilities (including holding yards) by the “appropriate IBD” column of Table 12.6. (T-1). 12.88.5.4.  As a PES, separate ships from AE operating facilities by either the barricaded IMD (K6 ) or unbarricaded IMD (K11 [4.36]) as applicable. (T-1).  An exception (see paragraph  12.19.)  is  permitted  when  the  ES  is  a  container  stuffing  and  unstuffing operation  that  routinely  supports  AE  ship  loading  and  unloading  operations.    QD requirements  of  paragraph    12.88.5.3.  must  apply  from  such  container  stuffing  and unstuffing operations (as a PES) to an AE ship (as an ES). (T-1). 12.88.6.  General Cargo and Vehicles at AE Terminals. 12.88.6.1.  Conduct  concurrent  movements  of  mission-related  general  cargo,  vehicles, and AE through a terminal for the purpose of loading or unloading the same ship. 12.88.6.2.  Conduct  concurrent  operations  involving  other  ships  at  applicable  QD separations (see Figure 12.9.). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 263 12.88.6.3.  Separation  of  inert  materials  and  equipment  in  holding  areas  must  be consistent with paragraph 12.67.  12.88.6.3.1.  Limit  personnel  entering  inert  holding  areas  that  are  located  within explosives safety QDs both in number and time of exposure. 12.88.6.3.2.  Any  labor  intense  activity  must  take  place  at  IBD  or  PTRD,  as applicable. Section 12P—-Space and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Requirements 12.89.  General  Information.  This section establishes explosives safety standards for storing, staging,  maintaining,  processing,  assembling,  handling,  and  testing  large  solid  rocket  motors (LSRM), motor segments and liquid propellants used in conjunction with space launch systems and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) test launches, and provides methods and criteria for mitigating the pre-launch risks associated with these operations. 12.89.1.  These standards apply to Air Force locations that process, launch, and test launch vehicles or ballistic missiles containing more than 1,000 pounds of liquid propellants or more than 10,000 pounds of solid propellants.  QD criteria for space and ICBM systems are found in paragraph 12.97. 12.89.2.  Space  launch  vehicles  and  ICBM  class  missile  systems  use  large  quantities  of energetic  materials  as  fuel  and  oxidizer  for  their  propulsion  systems.    Typically,  these propulsion  systems  contain  liquid  or  solid  propellants  in  thousand  to  million  pound quantities.    These  launch  vehicles  and  missile  systems  can,  under  launch  conditions,  react much  more  violently  than  during  conditions  such  as  transportation,  storage,  and  handling.  Launch  conditions  include  vehicles  in  a  fully  pressurized  configuration  (i.e.,  during countdowns and rehearsals, and testing on test stands).  Pressurized vehicles can present a hazard  to  a  wide  area  and,  in  some  cases,  miles  of  exposure.    The  combination  of  the potential  for  large  explosions  coupled  with  possible  wide  dispersion  of  the  threat  requires different  methods  of  mitigating  explosive  hazards  than  normally  used  for  non-dynamic hazards  analysis,  hazard  classification,  threat  mitigation,  and  siting.    These  hazards  and mitigating techniques will be contained in range or test requirement documents. 12.90.  Support Facilities  .  These include those facilities used to store, stage, or process large rocket  motors  and  motor  segments.    The  same  facility  may  be  used  for  both  staging  and processing these motors.  Take thermal and toxic properties as well as potential explosive effects IAW  applicable  directives  such  as  UFC  3-340-02  into  consideration  prior  to  selecting  or constructing  operational  maintenance  and  staging  facilities  for  large  rocket  motors  and  motor segments. 12.90.1.  Facility design and operational processing flow must keep the physical movement of  these  large  rocket  motors  and  motor  segments  to  an  absolute  minimum.    Limit  the operations performed in these facilities to those associated with the primary function of the facility.    Establish  safety  control  areas  as  defined  in  paragraph  12.91.,  for  all  hazardous operations in these facilities. 12.90.2.  There are two basic types of support facilities for large solid rocket motors (LSRM) and motor segments; a Motor Operations and Staging Facility, and a Motor Storage Facility. 264 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 12.90.2.1.  Motor  Operations  and  Staging  Facility.    This  facility  is  primarily  used  to process and assemble LSRMs and motor segments for launch operations.  It also has the capability for staging and maintaining motors and motor segments.  Conduct operations involved  with  preparing  LSRMs  and  motor  segments  using  approved  receipt-to-launch procedures or other approved technical data.  Unlike many explosives operating buildings currently  existing  on  military  installations,  the  large  motor  facilities  may  have  many direct  support  personnel  simultaneously  performing  different  tasks  in  support  of  the launch  preparation.    Limit  these  personnel  to  the  minimum  number  necessary  to accomplish  the  operation.    Establish  personnel  limits  in  the  operating  procedures.  Perform scheduled and unscheduled maintenance in this facility on motors and segments in the staging area.  Limit maintenance of large rocket motors and motor segments in the staging  area  to  periodic  maintenance  and  inspections  unless  a  hazard  risk  analysis indicates other operations may be safely performed.  When unscheduled or unforeseen operations  must  be  accomplished  on  solid  motors  in  the  staging  area,  the  appropriate technical team will perform a risk assessment IAW AFPAM 90-803, Risk Management (RM)  Guidelines  and  Tools.  (T-1).    Air  Force  explosives  safety  personnel  will  then evaluate and obtain approval of the risk assessment at the appropriate command level. (T-1). 12.90.2.2.  Motor Storage Facility.  This facility is primarily used for long term storage of motors and motor segments.  Keep the movement of LSRMs and motor segments into and out of storage to an absolute minimum.  Hazardous operations normally performed in these  facilities  involve  lifting  and  positioning  LSRMs  and  motor  segments.    Selected maintenance operations may be performed in these facilities provided they are limited to periodic maintenance inspections using approved procedures.  Unscheduled operations, such as repairs or the correction of discrepancies found during periodic inspections, may be  performed  in  these  facilities  if  a  risk  assessment  concludes  it  is  less  hazardous  to perform  the  maintenance  in  the  facility  than  to  move  the  segment  to  another  isolated facility.    If  government  resources  are  at  risk,  the  wing  Commander  or  equivalent Commander approves the task before it begins. (T-1).  If only commercial resources are at  risk,  risk  assessment  is  the  responsibility  of  the  commercial  operator.    Use  only Commander  approved  and  safety  reviewed/approved  procedures  when  maintaining  or repairing LSRMs and motor segments. (T-1). 12.90.3.  MAJCOMs  determine  whether  two  operations  involving  LSRM’s  are  dissimilar with  respect  to  the  hazards  presented  and  therefore  require  ILD  separation.    Factors  to consider when making this determination are: 12.90.3.1.  The  explosive  characteristics  and  quantities  of  explosives  involved  in  each operation. 12.90.3.2.  The end use of the LSRM’s undergoing preparation. 12.90.3.3.  The makeup of the teams performing the operations (i.e., Will the same team perform the operations). 12.90.4.  When  contractor  owned  large  rocket  motors  undergoing  preparation  are  used  for both  DoD  or  commercial  payloads  of  dissimilar  programs  and  are  within  ILD,  the responsible  contract  program  offices  and  installation  Commander  must  approve  the  risk analysis.  Once approved, use the combined NEWQD of all rocket motors within the PES for AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 265 explosive siting.  Adhere to quantity distance requirements between other ES and PES within IB of the operating location. 12.90.5.  Separate  LSRMs  earmarked  for  DoD  weapons  or  specific  missions  directed  by presidential  mandate  in  support  of  national  defense  (currently  Minuteman  III  and  Missile Defense Agency resources) from non-DoD assets by IBD. (T-1). 12.91.  Safety Control Area.  A safety control area is an area where personnel and equipment exposure  is  controlled  in  order  to  limit  the  risk  from  hazardous  explosives  operations.    For LSRMs, the safety control area is an area centered where the ordnance task is taking place and has a radius of IBD based on the quantity of explosives which may become involved in a mishap.  Certain engineering controls allow a reduction or modification in the size of the safety control area.  Only one hazardous explosives operation may take place in a safety control area at a time. (T-1).    Personnel  required  to  be  in  the  safety  control  area  during  an  explosives  operation  are considered  essential  personnel;  conversely,  people  who  do  not  meet  this  definition  are considered non-essential. 12.92.  Simultaneous Operations.  The large size of motor segments allows multiple operations to be easily conducted simultaneously on a single element, but the potential hazards that one task may present to another task must be carefully assessed before allowing more than one operation to proceed.  Personnel performing processing or maintenance tasks on LSRM segments must be aware  of  other  tasks  that  may  be  in  progress  on  the  same  segment.    Only  perform  a  single operation within the same safety control area at a time. (T-1). 12.93.  Barricades.  Use barricades with fixed storage tanks to prevent high velocity fragments from a ground liquid fuel propellant vapor phase confined explosion striking a test vehicle on the test stand. (T-1).  Design these barricades according to the criteria in paragraph 6.15. 12.94.  Space  Launch  Complex.  A  space  launch  complex  consists  of  a  group  of  related facilities used for launching space vehicles.  Facilities generally included are the launch pad(s), liquid  propellant  storage  tanks,  site  instrumentation  facilities,  engineering  personnel  support buildings  and  Launch  Center.    Additional  facilities  include  LSRM  facilities  and  spacecraft processing facilities.  A launch complex normally involves a variety of explosive hazards, the result of the presence of various quantities of liquid and solid propellants producing both mass fire and detonation explosive hazards.  Perform system safety engineering hazard analyses of the complex to identify the various explosive hazards, their relationships, and the safety threat zones and launch area location. (T-1). Quantity Distance criteria is found in paragraph 12.97. 12.95.  Space  Test  Facilities.  Space  test  facilities  normally  consist  of  a  wide  array  of  test resources  to  support  customers  including  flight  hardware  (ballistic,  space,  sounding  rocket launch vehicles and satellites) and ground systems (field test, assembly and storage, launch, and on-orbit test facilities).  A space test facility typically includes liquid propellant storage tanks or test site instrumentation, facility engineering personnel support buildings and a control center.  The facilities normally involve a variety of liquid and solid propellants  and can produce both mass fire and detonation explosive hazards.  Perform system safety engineering hazard analyses of the facilities to identify the various hazards, their relationships, the safety threat zones, etc.  (T-1). 12.96.  Risk  Management  (RM).  RM  processes  found  in  AFI  90-802,  Risk  Management, AFPAM  90-803,  and  the  standard  practices  in  MIL-STD  882E,  Systems  Safety  Program 266 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Requirements,  are  used  to  identify  and  to  assess  potential  hazards;  and  to  determine  and  to implement controls to minimize the risks associated with operations involving LSRMs and motor segments. 12.96.1.  The major hazards associated with space launch vehicles and missile prelaunch and propulsion test operations involve large quantities of propellants used in propulsion systems, destruct charges, and high pressure gas systems. 12.96.2.  Perform  hazard  assessments  to  measure  the  potential  for  and  consequences  of mishaps resulting from the undesired release of  energy or inhibiting the desired release of energy.  Use these assessments to define the MCE. 12.96.3.  Assess all launch vehicle operations to evaluate the hazards and to determine the mitigating activities necessary to achieve an acceptable level of risk, both for personnel and the launch or test site. 12.96.4.  Determine the expected risk before beginning any potentially hazardous operation and get approval from the appropriate supervisory level before proceeding.  Risk analyses must show that the potential benefits outweigh the cost in terms of overall risk before the operation is approved. 12.96.5.  Credible  Failure  Modes.    In  order  to  determine  the  potential  threat  that  a  given launch vehicle and support system configuration poses during prelaunch or propulsive test operations, define credible failure modes.  The specific failure mode that occurs will have a large influence on the explosive yield and the resultant blast overpressure, fragmentation, and thermal effects and thus on the severity of the accident environments, risk to personnel, and damage  to  facilities.    General  scenario  categories  include  the  following  phases  and operations: 12.96.5.1.  Prelaunch and Test Operations. 12.96.5.2.  Storage. 12.96.5.3.  Handling. 12.96.5.4.  Assembly. 12.96.5.5.  Checkout (at the assembly building and at the launch or test complex). 12.96.5.6.  Final Assembly. 12.96.5.7.  Ordnance Installation. 12.96.5.8.  Propellant Loading. 12.96.5.9.  All-up Vehicle Checkout (prior to launch and static firing). 12.96.6.  General Failure Modes.  Handle the failure modes for liquid propellants and solid propellants separately because their geometric and chemical configurations are different.  In the  case  of  solid  propellants,  the  fuel  and  oxidizer  are  already  mixed  homogeneously, therefore the failure scenarios do not have to account for mixing.  Liquid propellants, on the other hand, are configured in separate storage or launch vehicle tanks, therefore the failure scenarios must account for the type, amount, and probability of mixing propellants. 12.96.7.  Typical Prelaunch Failure Mode Scenarios: AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 267 12.96.7.1.  Storage. 12.96.7.1.1.  Liquid  propellant  scenarios  primarily  involve  leaking  or  ruptured propellant  tanks  caused  by  loss  of  pressure  control,  insulation  deficiencies, mechanical  damage,  and  corrosion.    Fuel  and  oxidizers  are  normally  stored separately, so limit an MCE to a fire and tank pressure rupture or tank rupture and toxic vapor release. 12.96.7.1.2.  Define  solid  propellant  accident  scenarios  by  the  hazard  classification grouping  -  1.1  mass  detonation,  or  1.3  -  mass  fire.    The  most  likely  candidates  to cause accidental ordnance initiation are introduction of stray electrical energy, fire, and  dropping  the  segment  with  sufficient  impact  force  to  initiate  the  propellant  or destruct charge if present. 12.96.7.2.  Handling. 12.96.7.2.1.  Handle liquid oxidizer and fuel separately using independent closed loop systems.  Normally, differential pressure is used to transfer product from one holding tank to another or to load a launch vehicle.  Typical accident events are limited to system leaks, vent and scrubber failures, or at worst, a tank rupture caused by over- or under-pressurization.    Launch  vehicle  propellant  loading  scenarios  are  discussed  in another section.  Load liquid propellants serially to further reduce prelaunch mixing hazards. (T-1). 12.96.7.2.2.  Handle solid propellant rocket motors by lifting with cranes or erectors at  static  test  stands,  the  launch  mount,  in  a  processing  facility,  or  by  various transportation modes.  Typically the MCE scenario involves vehicle rollover, or drop impacts  during  lifting  or  transportation.    Drop  impacts  on  hard  surfaces  can  cause propellant ignition. 12.96.7.3.  Booster Assembly. 12.96.7.3.1.  Launch  vehicle  assembly  processes  normally  do  not  involve  liquid propellants. 12.96.7.3.2.  Assembly operations for solid propellant rocket motors typically involve the same credible accident scenarios as those listed for handling. 12.96.7.4.  Booster  Checkout.    Booster  checkout  normally  does  not  impose  additional hazards above and beyond those already listed except that the potential for inadvertent ignition of EIDs or inadvertent function of propellant system isolation valves is increased during  certain  electrical  system  checkouts.    Pad  or  test  stand  checkout  is  normally accomplished  after  assembly  and  loading  of  solid  propellant  and  hypergolic  propellant stages.    Multi-faceted  threats  exist  with  interaction  between  hypergolic  and  solid propellants that can result in pressure ruptures, toxic vapor hazard and propulsive flight. 12.96.7.5.  Final  Assembly.    Normally,  the  launch  booster,  upper  stages,  and  payload final assembly process is accomplished on the launch pad.   Both solid propellants and hypergolic liquid propellants are present during the final assembly steps.  A major threat involves the assembly and encapsulation of spacecraft and upper stages in facilities off the launch complex.  These operations normally involve hypergolic propellants loaded in separate propellant tanks.  Credible accident scenarios include puncture of one or more of 268 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 the  propellant  tanks  during  assembly  or  checkout,  impact  caused  by  lifting,  failure resulting in a dropped system, or over- or under pressurization.  Since these propellants are  hypergolic;  the  potential  exists  for  a  fire  if  the  fuel  comes  into  contact  with  an oxidizer.    Another  major  threat  involves  the  toxicity  of  these  propellants.    Credible accident  scenarios  primarily  involve  handling,  lifting,  and  mating  stages  with  tank rupture accident scenarios the result of impacts caused by improper handling or dropping one or more stages.  The results are the same as those listed above. 12.96.7.6.  Ordnance Installation.  Ordnance installation may take place in an off-the-pad assembly building or on the launch pad.  During and after installation, credible accident scenarios  primarily  involve  inadvertent  ignition  of  EIDs.    These  devices  must  not  be capable of detonating either the solid or liquid propellant.  Inadvertent ignition of these devices  can  result  in  significant  damage  to  the  vehicle  and  severe  injury  or  death  to personnel.    Unless  unavoidable,  do  not  load  cryogenic  liquid  propellants  on  a  launch vehicle until after ordnance is installed. 12.96.7.7.  Propellant  Loading.    MCE  accident  scenarios  during  propellant  loading involve over- or under-pressurization of the propellant tanks and major spills of fuel and oxidizer.  These scenarios can result in a significant explosive yield. 12.96.7.8.  All-Up Vehicle Checkout.  This occurs prior to launch or static firing.  During this phase of prelaunch operations the final liquid propellant topping off is completed and in some cases the liquid propellant and high pressure gas systems are brought to flight pressure.    All  systems  are  switched  to  internal  power  and  final  systems  checks  are performed.  The MCE involves the fully loaded launch vehicle and payload.  Explosive yield is based on static conditions for shock impact on solid propellants and non-dynamic mixing  of  liquid  propellant  either  by  the  Confined  by  Missile  (CBM)  mode  or  the Confined by Ground Surface (CBGS) mode. 12.97.  Space and Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Criteria. 12.97.1.  Some launch pad facilities such as mobile service towers, umbilical mast towers, launch ducts, launch center, and launch mounts are identified by a building number on the base master plan.  For the purpose of explosive site planning, consider them an “integral part of  the  facility”  and  do  not  require  exposed  site  separation  distances  due  to  the  common nature of their function.  Likewise, facilities that provide direct support to these launch pads such  as  maintenance  and  build-up  shops,  pressurization  systems,  instrumentation  terminal rooms, etc., are an integral part of the facility and do not require QD separation distances from the pads they support. 12.97.2.  Technical support areas may be associated with these facilities.  Locate all direct support  personnel  at  no  less  than  IL  distance  or  equivalent  protection  from  the  PES  and dispatch them to the PES as required. 12.97.3.  Locate  any  parking  lots  (GOV  or  POV)  exclusively  serving  the  motor  or  motor storage, staging, or operations facility according to Chapter 12. 12.97.4.  Locate  launch  complexes  at  Air  Force  launch  ranges  using  two  sets  of  criteria.  Base the first set on QD criteria.  They address pre-launch operations (including pressurized launch rehearsal) and static explosive threats.  Define these for each facility in the ESP. (T-1).    The  TNT  equivalencies  to  be  used  are  included  in  Table  12.17.    The  second  set  of AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 269 criteria  is  used  to  locate  a  launch  complex  on  the  range  address  launch  and  space  vehicle dynamic  flight.    Range  safety  guidance  defines  the  criteria  and  flight  safety  analysis techniques required to determine the down range explosive threat resulting from a launch. 12.97.4.1.  Separate new launch pads by at least an IL distance from each other. (T-1).  The larger NEWQD of the two launch vehicles dictates the minimum separation between the two launch pads.  For HD 1.1 launch vehicles, the minimum separation required is K-18.  For HD 1.3 launch vehicles, Table 12.12.,  ILD column.  Hazardous operations in one  facility  may  impact  operations  in  another  related  facility.    In  order  to  protect personnel,  consider  IB  quantity  distance  criteria  between  launch  pads  for  new construction, as opposed to IL distances. 12.97.4.2.  Determine launch complex locations in the range launch area based on flight safety analyses including risk analysis such as the Launch Area Risk Analysis (LARA) program  and  other  flight  safety  techniques  described  in  range  safety  guidance.    The Range  Safety  Office  responsible  for  a  launch  area  will  consider  explosive  siting  and missile flight hazards when determining the location of a launch complex in relationship with other launch complexes and support facilities. 12.97.4.3.  For  QD  purposes,  measure  from  the  explosives  at  the  launch  mount,  for  a launch complex and at the test stand, for a test complex. 12.97.5.  Space  Test  Facilities.    During  explosives  site  planning  for  new  motor  or  motor segment test operation facilities, provide a personnel direct support facility at least ILD from the  PES.    (T-1).    It  will  be  a  dispatch  point,  break  room,  and  change  room  for  these personnel.    Locate  these  direct  support  personnel  facilities  at  closer  than  IL  distances  if protective  measures  are  used  to  provide  minimum  required  overpressure  and  fragment protection.  Use the prevailing wind direction as a primary consideration when locating test stands in relationship to other facilities that will be inhabited during testing.  Do not hazard Government  assests  with  non-DoD  LSRM  test  facilities  on  Air  Force  installations.  (T-1).  Use Table 12.31. to determine siting criteria for non-DoD explosives activities. (T-1). Note:  This separate location will permanently house direct support personnel for the PES.   12.97.6.  Static Test Facilities.  Site and construct static test facilities for maximum flexibility to  meet  frequently  changing  technological  requirements.    A  typical  static  test  facility  will have  several  test  stands  that  share  common  support  facilities  such  as  ready  storage  tanks, pressurization  systems,  test  control  rooms,  maintenance  support  and  build-up  shops,  and steam-generating vacuum systems.  To the extent possible, separate test stands by ILD.  In some cases test support requirements, such as vacuum testing, do not support QD separation if test objectives are to be achieved.  To minimize the risk to adjacent test stands, use only one  test  stand  at  a  time  when  QD  requirements  cannot  be  met.    Remove  or  protect  all equipment not being used to support current test operations, or obtain a waiver approved at the appropriate level.  See Chapter 1 for waiver or exemption procedures. 12.97.7.  Building  and  Use  of  Non-DoD  Space  Explosives  Facilities  on  Air  Force Installations  and  Non-DoD  Use  of  Existing  Government  Facilities.    Air  Force  guidance permits  a  non-DoD  space  user  to  lease  land  on  an  Air  Force  installation  and  construct explosives facilities to support non-DoD and Government space operations.  Additionally, a non-DoD  space  user  may  be  granted  a  license  to  use  an  existing  Government  explosives 270 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 facility.    These  facilities  include  but  are  not  limited  to  explosives  storage  facilities, explosives operations facilities, missile launch pads, test facilities, and combinations thereof.  Use Table 12.31. for QD criteria for siting non-DoD explosives activities. 12.97.8.  DoD  Explosives  Hazard  Classification.   Apply  DoD  explosives  hazard classifications to explosives stored or used on military installations and reflect them in all applicable facility ESPs.  For commercial explosive items that have not been acquired and adopted  for  use  by  the  Air  Force,  but  will  be  stored  and  transported  on  an  Air  Force installation in conjunction with commercial launch programs, the following exceptions may be applied: 12.97.8.1.  The  items  may  be  offered  for  transportation  off  the  installation  via commercial  carriers  using  hazard  classification  approvals item manufacturers by the Department of Transportation (DOT). 12.97.8.2.  An item may be stored, handled, and transported on the installation using the hazard  classification  approval  issued  by  DOT  if  the  local  Commander  reviews  and concurs  with  that  hazard  classification,  except  for  articles  assigned  to  hazard class/division 1.2.  These must be stored and handled as DoD hazard class/division 1.1. (T-1).  Obtain approval to store non-DoD commercial items as hazard class/division 1.2 from a DoD hazard classification authority listed in TO 11A-1-47. (T-1). issued to the 12.97.9.  Expanding  QD  and  Risk  Assessment.    Problems  are  encountered  around  launch pads and test stands where lack of real estate coupled with a high concentration of people, facilities, and equipment make compliance with QD standards impossible.  Explosive content of a launch pad or test stand varies according to a well-defined operational concept and the maximum NEW is typically present only during a short period of time just before launch or test.  This allows management to take actions to protect or remove resources and personnel as the NEW is increased. 12.97.10.  Expanding QD.  Expanding QD is a process available to Commanders similar to tiered  siting  allowing  them  to  analyze  and  minimize  risk  to  personnel,  facilities,  and operational  capabilities.    Expanding  QD  is  a  risk-based  management  tool  that  provides  an organized way to evaluate risks and assess action that mitigates the impact of an explosive mishap during periods of increased activity.  In an expanding QD system, a launch pad or test stand  may  have  different  NEWQDs  during  different  stages  of  prelaunch  or  test  missile buildup.    To  maximize  protection  under  the  expanding  QD  approach,  the  responsible Commander  will  develop  and  publish  procedures  to  ensure  non-essential  equipment, supplies, and personnel are removed prior to increasing NEWQD limits. (T-1). 12.97.11.  Procedures for Expanding QD RM.  Determine launch pad or test stand NEWQD for various stages of launch vehicle buildup.  For each stage, evaluate all ESs that are within the  QD  arc  generated  by  the  NEWQD.    If  QD  criteria  are  not  violated  in  the  largest  arc, submit an ESP for the maximum NEWQD. (T-1).  If violations exist, the following actions are required: 12.97.11.1.  Evacuate non-direct support personnel from an ES falling within the QD arc generated  by  the  NEWQD.    A  waiver  or  exemption  is  required  if  the  ES  cannot  be evacuated AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 271 12.97.11.2.  Publish  procedures  to  minimize  risk  for  stage  with  QD  violations.

In general, the Air Force is moving away from the use of hardened blockhouses located at launch complexes in favor of soft, remote launch control centers.  Until all operations requiring on-site manning in the launch center during launch are  moved  to  remote  locations,  ensure  launch  center  personnel  are  protected  to  a reasonable degree of safety.  In the event of detonation of a launch vehicle on the launch pad or shortly after lift-off, the launch center must be able to withstand a direct impact of the largest expected amount of explosive debris and also the over-pressure resulting from the initial explosion and from subsequent explosions of firebrands landing nearby. 12.97.12.2.  Test Control Launch Center.  Launch Centers for static test stands can either be  unprotected  facilities  at  K-24  for  the  maximum  propellant  load,  or  be  hardened facilities capable of providing K-24 overpressure protection and fragment protection from the maximum propellant load. 272 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Figure 12.1.

Use of this figure is only allowed if no single trailer servicing the aircraft would present an MCE greater than the MCE used to generate the aircraft QD arcs.  In most cases, this means that the trailer cannot be loaded with more than the MCE of missiles.  Where test resulSts permit, such as in the case of a single layer of AIM-120 missiles loaded in alternating directions on a single trailer, apply reduced trailer MCEs.  In that specific case, the trailer MCE is a single AIM-120 missile.  Do not consider IM or IL criteria for the internal HD 1.2 gun ammunition and internal HD 1.3 flares with these loads.   2.

Use this K-factor for NEWQD in PES greater than 250,000 lbs. 3.  These barricades serve to mitigate both fragment and overpressure hazards.  See Section 6E for their requirements. 4.  ECMs must meet the design requirements in Section 6C.  Paragraph 12.21. defines sectors (front/side/rear) of ECMs.  Consider the front sector of an ECM unbarricaded unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards. 5.  These barricades serve to mitigate fragment hazards.  See Section 6D for their requirements. 6.  AGMs are all types of above grade (non-earth-covered) magazines or storage pads.  This includes open air munitions stocks, light structures (e.g., Butler buildings), and trucks/trailers/railcars loaded with explosives. 7.  Although Barricaded Modules are considered AGMs, reduced QD (K1.1) may be applied between modules provided the requirements of Section 6D are met (to include limitations on the type of AE being stored in them, and prohibition on the use of heavy structures).  If the requirements of Section 6D are not met, use AGM criteria. 8.  See paragraph 12.24.1. 9.  See paragraph 12.24.2. 10.  See paragraph 12.24.3. 11.  See paragraph 12.24.4. 12.  See Section 12F - Allowable Exposures, Section 12H – HD1.1 QD Criteria, and Section 12O - QD criteria for specific facilities and systems.   13.  Use Table 12.22. (K30 with a 111 foot minimum) to provide aircraft survivability from blast overpressure.  Additionally, barricades are required if protection from low-angle, high-speed fragments is desired; side/rear of an ECM suffice as barricades for this purpose. 14.  Minimum required distance is K11 or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E is between the PES and ES.  Combat aircraft may be separated at less than IMD provided: a) Their NEWQDs are combined to determine required QD to other exposures and b) Approval is obtained from at least the Vice Commander of the MAJCOM or Numbered Air Force (NAF) having operational control (OPCON) of the exposed aircraft (except for revetted cells containing two aircraft).  If separation at less than IMD is required for support of a Unified Combatant Commander, the Vice Commander of the MAJCOM or NAF having OPCON of the aircraft will be the lowest approval level. 15.  For QD purposes, an aircraft group is defined as two or more aircraft loaded with combat configured explosives that are parked at less than IMD.  Although they do not reduce the required separation, intervening barricades are recommended.  With NAF or MAJCOM approval, IMD may be used between groups for contingency operations, per Chapter 13.  16.  This distance may be reduced to K11 or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E is between the PES and ES.  See Note 13 if survivability is desired.   17.  Consider parked aeroclub aircraft as non-DoD aircraft for QD purposes; the presence of aeroclub aircraft does not make an airfield joint-use. 18.  MAJCOMs may require greater separation for unique mission or high value aircraft. 19.  See paragraph 12.23. for IBD and PTRD separation criteria. 20.  These distances may be reduced with MAJCOM approval. 21.  When required at locations outside the U.S. use K4.5.  The use of this reduced separation depends on operational necessity, providing the Commander accepts the transient risk to military aircraft movements.  Include the written risk acceptance as part of the ESP submission. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 287 22.  Use this row for locations in the open where passengers board and deplane. 23.  Use this row if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger terminal building. 24.  Use this table for siting HD 1.5 (see paragraph 12.13.5.). 25.  This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure.  For IMD protection, this distance may be reduced to K9 or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E is between the PES and ES. 26.  This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure.  For IMD protection, this distance may be reduced to K2.75.  27.  This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure.  For IMD protection, this distance may be reduced to K2.75.   28.  This distance provides aircraft survivability from blast overpressure.  For IMD protection, this distance may be reduced from K9, or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E is between the PES and ES.   29.  Base separations on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling, servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters.  If doors are left open for extended periods, normal CAPA apply to and from the front.  As a PES, parenthetical (xx) fragment distances do not apply except out the front of a Korean TAB VEE HAS and out the front/rear of a Korean Flow-Through HAS. 30.  HASs must meet the category requirements in paragraph 12.50.1.  Sectors (front/side/rear) of HASs are defined in paragraph 12.21.  Consider the front sector of an HAS unbarricaded unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards.  (See paragraph 12.50.) 31.  This distance provides aircraft survivability.  For IMD protection, this distance may be reduced to K11 or K6 if a barricade meeting the requirements of Section 6E is between the PES and ES.   32.  Use Table 12.26. 33.  Use Table 12.25. 34.  Use Table 12.23. (IMD equivalent separation) for separation between HASs and between HASs and HAS Ready Service ECMs/AGMs.  Use Table 12.24 (aircraft survivability) if survivability is desired 35.  IBD out the side is K62; IBD out the rear is K40; IBD out the front is K50. 36.  See paragraph 12.23. 37.  See paragraph 12.24. 38.  See paragraph 12.40. 39.  See paragraph 12.41. 40.  See paragraph 12.42. 288 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Table 12.2.  HD  1.2.1,  1.2.2, and  1.2.3 QD Criteria.   AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 289   290 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017  Notes:  1.  See Section 12F - Allowable Exposures for additional exposures and Section 12O - QD criteria for specific facilities and systems.   2.  When the NEWQD and the MCE of the packaged HD 1.2.1 items fall within the ranges specified in equation (NEWQD < MCE < 450 lbs), the HD 1.2.1 will be treated as HD 1.1 and the criteria of paragraph 12.23.1.1., as applicable, will be used (see paragraph 12.26.1.). 3.  When siting HD 1.2.3, cap the NEWQD of the largest single round at < 450 pounds, and cap the (xx) at 1300 feet.  These caps are for simplicity in siting and may be exceeded with AFSEC/SEW approval. 4.  ECMs must meet the design requirements in Section 6C.  Sectors (front/side/rear) of ECMs are defined in paragraph 12.21.  The front sector of an ECM is considered unbarricaded unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards. 5.  These barricades serve to mitigate fragment hazards.  See Section 6E for their requirements. 6.  AGMs are all types of above grade (non earth-covered) magazines or storage pads.  This includes open air munitions stocks, light structures (e.g., Butler buildings), and trucks/trailers/railcars loaded with explosives. 7.  Required IMD separation is as follows:  HD 1.2.1 MCE < 100 lbs:  200 feet;  HD 1.2.1 MCE > 100 lbs:  300 feet;  HD 1.2.2:  100 feet;  HD 1.2.3 to an ES containing only HD 1.2.3: 50 feet;  HD 1.2.3 to an ES containing other than HD 1.2.3:  K11 based on the NEWQD of the single round of the largest (greatest NEWQD) HD 1.2.3 item in the PES. 8.  Although Barricaded Modules are considered AGMs, reduced QD may be applied between modules, provided the requirements of Section 6D are met (to include limitations on the type of AE being stored in them, and prohibition on the use of heavy structures).  If the requirements of Section 6D are not met, use AGM criteria.  Base IM distance for HD 1.2.x. for module to module separation on total NEWQD.   9.  Do not use MCE and LSRN to calculate IM distance between modules per Note 8 above. 10.  Required ILD separation is as follows: 11.  HD 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3:  36 percent of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating the ES as an AGM. 12.  Apply PTRD separation per Note 21. If aircraft survivability is mandated by the MAJCOM, PTRD to the front of HAS with doors normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability or IBD separation per Note 17 for aircraft survivability for all other relationships.   13.  Apply PTRD separation per Note 22. If aircraft survivability is mandated by the MAJCOM, PTRD to the front of HAS with doors normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability or IBD separation per Note 18 for aircraft survivability for all other relationships.   14.  Apply IMD separation treating the ES as an AGM.  If aircraft survivability is mandated by the MAJCOM, IBD separation per Note 17 is required for aircraft survivability.   AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 291 15.  Apply IMD separation treating the ES as an AGM. If aircraft survivability is mandated by the MAJCOM, IBD separation per Note 18 is required for aircraft survivability.   16.  Apply IMD separation treating the ES as an AGM.   17.  Required IBD separation is as follows:  HD 1.2.1 MCE < 100 lbs:  200 feet;  HD 1.2.1 MCE > 100 lbs:  300 feet;  HD 1.2.2:  100 feet;  HD 1.2.3:  IBD per paragraph 12.27.2.1. 18.  Required IBD separation is as follows: HD 1.2.1 in a structure/truck/trailer/railcar/cargo aircraft: IBD is the larger of the IBD from Table 12.9. or the HDD from Table 12.10. HD 1.2.1 in the open/external a/c AE/stacks on open truck/trailer/railcar:  IBD is the IBD from Table 12.9 HD 1.2.2:  IBD is the IBD from Table 12.11. HD 1.2.3:  IBD per paragraph 12.27.2.1. 19.  Consider parked aero club aircraft as non-DoD aircraft for QD purposes; the presence of aero club aircraft does not make an airfield joint-use. 20.  MAJCOMs may require greater separation for unique mission or high value aircraft. 21.  Required PTRD separation is as follows:  HD 1.2.1 MCE < 100 lbs:  200 feet;  HD 1.2.1 MCE > 100 lbs:  300 feet;  HD 1.2.2:  100 feet;  HD 1.2.3:  60 percent of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating the ES as an AGM (H or L) 22.  Required PTRD separation is as follows:  HD 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3:  60 percent of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating the ES as an AGM (H or L). 23.  When required at overseas locations only, use 125 feet.  The use of this reduced separation depends on operational necessity, providing the Commander accepts the transient risk to military aircraft movements.  If siting facilities, the MAJCOM/CC or CV must provide AFSEC/SEW a letter listing all installations where this separation distance will apply and state acceptance of transient risk to military aircraft movements.   24.  Use this row for locations in the open where passengers board and deplane. 25.  Use this row if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger terminal building. 26.  Treat as an Operating Location to determine required ILD separation. 27.  No QD separation is required, unless the MAJCOM requires aircraft survivability (PTRD to the front of HAS with doors normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability; use IBD separation per Note 18 for aircraft survivability for all other relationships).   28.  No QD separation is required. 29.  MAJCOMs will determine required QD separation. 30.  ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for HD 1.2 provided they meet separation requirements for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1, and provided separations to other exposures comply with applicable QD criteria.  31.  Base separations on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling, servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters.  If doors are left open for extended periods, normal CAPA apply from the front. 32.  HASs must meet the category requirements in paragraph 12.50.1.  Sectors (front/side/rear) of HASs are defined in paragraph 12.21.  Consider the front sector of an HAS unbarricaded unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards (see paragraph 12.50.) 33.  First, Second and Third Generation HASs, and Korean TAB VEE HASs, sited for HD 1.2.1 MCE < 110 lbs, HD 1.2.2, or HD 1.2.3 LSRN<110 lbs do not generate a QD clear zone except 292 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 out the front.  Korean Flow-Through HASs sited for HD 1.2.1 MCE < 110 lbs, HD 1.2.2, or HD 1.2.3 LSRN<110 lbs do not generate a QD clear zone except out the front and rear.   34.  Fire protection distances still apply in Note 33 above. 35.  Treat First, Second, and Third Generation HAS as AGM (H/R), Korean TAB VEE side/rear as an AGM (H/R) and front as an AGM (H or L), Korean Flow-Through side as an AGM (H/R) and front/rear as an AGM (H or L) 36.  Required ILD separation is as follows:  HD 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3:  36 percent of the IBD, with a minimum distance equal to the IMD treating First, Second, and Third Generation as an AGM (H/R), Korean TAB VEE side/rear as an AGM (H/R) and front as an AGM (H or L), Korean Flow-Through side as an AGM (H/R) and front/rear as an AGM (H or L) 37.  MAJCOM may require aircraft survivability (PTRD to the front of HAS with doors normally closed is acceptable for aircraft survivability; use IBD separation per Note 18 for aircraft survivability for all other relationships). 38.  Treat the PES as an AGM:  for a front exposure from a First, Second or Third Generation HAS, use (H/R) criteria; for a front exposure from a Korean TAB VEE or Korean Flow-Through HAS, use (L) criteria.  Treat the ES as an Operating Location:  to a First, Second, and Third Generation use (H/R) criteria; to the side/rear of a Korean TAB VEE use (H/R) criteria and to the front use (H or L) criteria; to the side of a Korean Flow-Through use (H/R) criteria and to the front/rear use (H or L) criteria.   39.  Base separations on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling, servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are being moved into or out of shelters.  If doors are left open for extended periods, treat the front exposure as an Operating Location (H or L). 40.  See paragraph 12.40. 41.  See paragraph 12.41. 42.  See paragraph 12.42. 43.  Practical considerations such as firefighting and security dictate specific separation distance requirements.  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 293 Table 12.3.

This includes open air munitions stocks, light structures (e.g., Butler buildings), and trucks/trailers/railcars loaded with explosives.  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 295 4.  The requirements of Section 6D are met (to include limitations on the type of AE stored in them and prohibition on the use of heavy structures).  If the requirements of Section 6D are not met, use AGM criteria.  HD 1.3 is not allowed in modules.   5.  Consider parked aeroclub aircraft as non-DoD aircraft for QD purposes; the presence of aeroclub aircraft does not make an airfield joint-use. 6.  MAJCOMs may require greater separation for unique mission or high value aircraft. 7.  Use this row for locations in the open where passengers enplane and deplane. 8.  Use this row if a structure is included where passengers assemble, such as a passenger terminal building. 9.  ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for HD 1.3 and 1.4 provided they meet separation requirements for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1, and provided separations to other exposures comply with applicable QD criteria.  10.  HD 1.4S may be stored (including associated handling) without regard to QD criteria (see paragraphs 12.29.3. and 2.23.). 11.  Magazines storing only HD 1.4 may be located at IMD (per Table 12.13.) to all other explosives facilities (regardless of HD of NEWQD authorized in these facilities).  Because the HD 1.4 may be destroyed as the result of a mishap involving the assets in these adjacent explosives facilities, the responsible Commander must accept the potential loss of the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure.  Document the Commander’s risk acceptance by letter (i.e., signed by the Commander stating he/she understands and accepts the potential loss of the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure in the event of a mishap in an adjacent explosives facility) and submitted as part of the ESP.  A new risk acceptance letter does not need to be generated when a new adjacent explosives facility is sited, as long as the original letter documented that other such structures might be added in future. 12.  Required IMD separation is as follows:  HD 1.3:  See Table 12.12. IMD & ILD Column;  HD 1.4:  See Table 12.13. ECM IMD Column;  HD 1.6:  See Table 12.14. IMD & ILD Column. 13.

Required IBD or PTRD separation is as follows:  HD 1.3:  See Table 12.12. IBD & PTRD Column;  HD 1.4:  See Table 12.13. IBD & PTRD Column;  HD 1.6:  See Table 12.14. IBD & PTRD Column. 16.  If required by the MAJCOM, for aircraft survivability, apply IBD/PTRD separation is as follows:  HD 1.3:  See Table 12.12. IBD & PTRD Column;  HD 1.4:  See Table 12.13. IBD & PTRD Column;  HD 1.6:  See Table 12.14. IBD & PTRD Column. 17.  When required at overseas locations only, use 125 feet for HD 1.3.  The use of this reduced separation depends on operational necessity, providing the Commander accepts the transient risk to military aircraft movements.  If siting facilities, the MAJCOM/CC or CV must provide AFSEC/SEW a letter listing all installations where this separation distance will apply and state acceptance of transient risk to military aircraft movements.   18.

MAJCOMs will determine required QD separation. 296 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 21.  MAJCOM may require aircraft survivability (apply IBD/PTRD per Note 16 for aircraft survivability).   22.  A HAS sited for HD 1.3 or 1.4 does not generate a QD clear zone except out the front.   23.  HASs must meet the category requirements in paragraph 12.50.1.  Sectors (front/side/rear) of HASs are defined in paragraph 12.21.  The front sector of an HAS is considered unbarricaded unless barricaded per Section 6E to mitigate fragment hazards (see paragraph 12.50.) 24.  See paragraph 12.40. 25.  See paragraph 12.41. 26.

Ten units or more until the point is reached where this distance is exceeded by the distance requirements of Table 12.6. 2.  More than 10 units may be involved before 1250 feet is exceeded.  Consult AFSEC/SEW for distances involving more than 10 units. 3.  When handling more than one missile, transport or handle the missiles in a nose-to-tail configuration and in their launch capsule or shipping container; furthermore, they must be aligned and/or handled so that each group of two missiles is located outside of the warhead fragment beam spray region of the other two missiles. 4.  Consult AFSEC/SEW for distances involving more than 8 units. 5.  PTRD is 60 percent of the resulting IBD.  ILD / IMD will be based on NEWQD.   6.  Items identified by an asterisk “*” include fragments from shipping or storage containers.  However, all of the HFD in this table may be applied to both packaged and unpackaged configurations. 7.  105 mm projectiles and 105mm complete rounds not in standard storage or shipping containers are HD 1.1. 8.

Use these distances when handling torpedo(es) from 2.5-ton trucks (or larger) where sandbag (or other equivalent) shielding (as described in Note (e) below) is not present between the leading edge of the torpedo(es) warhead and the truck crew cab to prevent the crew cab and windshield from contributing to the debris.   10.  Use these distances when handling torpedo (es) from:  a) 2.5-ton trucks (or larger) with sandbag (or other equivalent) shielding between the leading edge of the torpedo (es) warhead and the truck crew cab to prevent the crew cab and windshield from contributing to the debris, b) Other means of transportation such as flatbed trailers, boats, torpedo transporters, forklifts, or portable cranes.  (Sandbag shield requirement is equivalent to a minimum thickness of two feet of sand between the truck crew cab and the torpedo(es).  The sandbags must shield all parts of the crew cab and windshield from the torpedo warhead). 11.  Limit handling to one launch tube at a time, with other tubes closed; risks associated with possible propagation from the Tomahawk being handled to all other AE in the SSGN as well as to AE in nearby combatant ships/boats must be assumed by the Navy under an appropriate deviation from these Standards.  (If handling is not limited to one launch tube at a time, with other tubes closed, the NEW of the full SSGN load will apply for siting IAW with this Standard.)  The reduced QD arc shall be drawn from the tube.  (Pier-side staging areas must still be sited; however, the reduced QD in this table for Tomahawk missiles may be used provided the restrictions of Note 3 are applied.) AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Table 12.6.

Existing ECM, regardless of orientation, that meet the construction and barricading requirements and meet separation requirements one from another for a minimum of 100 lbs NEWQD of HD 1.1 (using the ECM-to-ECM QD criteria in Table 12.1.) may be used to their physical storage capacity for HD 1.3, provided all other QD relationships are sited per Table 12.12. for the HD 1.3 NEWQD. 5.  For quantities less than 1,000 lbs, the required distances are those specified for 1,000 lbs.  The use of lesser distances may be approved when supported by test data and/or analyses. 6.  See Chapter 11 for storage and operations involving limited quantities of HD 1.3. Table 12.13.  HD  1.4 QD.  Notes: 1.  HD 1.4 AE may be stored in a general supplies warehouse area rather than in an AE storage area. When storing in a general supplies warehouse area, any weatherproof warehouse structure may serve as an HD 1.4 magazine. Separate such a structure from all other warehouses per the AGS (L) IMD column of this table. 2.  See paragraph 12.7.1.1. for the applicability of HD 1.4 QD criteria and the determination of NEWQD when HD 1.4 and other HD AE are located in the same site. 3.

IBD and PTRD are 50 feet from an AGS (H), an AGS (H/R), and an ECM front that meets the definition of AGS (H) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2., doors and other openings shall be barricaded IAW Section 6E, or the IBD or PTRD column of this table applied from them. 4.  ILD is zero feet from the sides and rear of an ECM.  ILD is zero feet from an AGS (H), an AGS (H/R), and an ECM front that meets the definition of AGS (H) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2.  Doors and other openings shall be barricaded IAW Section 6E, or the ILD column of this table applied from these doors and openings. 5.  Magazines storing only HD 1.4 AE may be located at these IM or IL distances from all other magazines or operating locations regardless of the HD or NEWQD authorized in those adjacent structures.  Because the HD 1.4 AE may be destroyed as the result of an accident involving the assets in those adjacent structures, the responsible Commander must accept the potential loss of the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure.  Document the Commander’s risk acceptance by letter (i.e., signed by the Commander stating he/she understands and accepts the potential loss of the HD 1.4 stocks and the storage structure in the event of a mishap in an adjacent explosives facility) and submitted as part of the ESP.  A new risk acceptance letter is not required when a AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 309 new adjacent explosives facility is sited, as long as the original letter documented that other such structures might be added in the future.   6.  Applies to all AGS (L) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2. 7.  Applies to all AGS (H) and AGS (H/R) as defined in the legend for Table 12.2.  Doors and other openings shall be barricaded IAW Section 6E, or the AGS (L) IMD column of this table applied to and from these doors and openings. 8.  HD 1.4S may be stored (including associated handling) without regard to QD criteria (see paragraphs 12.29.3. and 2.23.).  Additionally, for reasons of operational necessity, limited quantities of HD 1.4 AE (e.g., small arms AE and riot control munitions) may be stored within facilities (e.g., hangars, arms rooms, and operating buildings) without regard to QD.  See Chapter 11 for storage and operations involving limited quantities of HD 1.4. 9.  There is no upper limit on the NEWQD specifically required for safety reasons. 10.  Use the smaller distance when the ES is of non-combustible construction.  Treat combat aircraft and explosives-loaded cargo aircraft as non-combustible structures.   11.  Apply the appropriate AGS column of this table based on whether the ECM front meets the definition of AGS (L) or AGS (H), as defined in the legend for Table 12.2. 12.  ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for HD 1.4 provided they meet separation requirements for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1, and provided separations to other exposures comply with applicable QD criteria.

Should be used as a default value, unless otherwise hazard classified, when the material is packaged in small (non-bulk) shipping containers, portable ground support equipment, small aerospace flight vehicle propellant tanks or similar pressure vessels that provide heavy confinement (burst pressure greater than 100 psi). 6.  Should be used as a default value, unless otherwise hazard classified, when the material is packaged in small (non-bulk) shipping containers (DOT 5C or equivalent), portable ground support equipment, small aerospace flight vehicle propellant tanks, or similar pressure vessels providing a lower level of confinement (burst pressure less than or equal to 100 psi and if adequate protection from fragments is not provided from terrain, effective barricades, nets, or other physical means (lightweight building construction is not adequate).  If protection from fragments is provided, use the IBD/PTRD "Protected" column of Table 12.21. 7.  For large ready, bulk, or rest storage tanks (as defined in paragraphs 12.36.7., 12.36.9., and 12.36.10.), use Table 12.21. 8.  Where there is a reasonable risk of vapor cloud explosion of large quantities (e.g., in bulk tank storage). 9.  Technical grade nitromethane in unit quantities of 55 gallons or less in DOT approved containers listed in 49CFR Part 173.202 may be stored as flammable liquids (See Table 12.18.) provided the following apply:  a) Packages are stored only one tier high, b) Packages are protected from direct rays of sun, c) Maximum storage life of two years, unless storage life tests indicate product continues to meet purchase specification. Such tests are to be repeated at one-year intervals thereafter. 10.  For underwater static test stands, when operated at hydrostatic pressure above 50 psig, or for propellant tanks or other vessels having burst pressures of greater than 100 psig without acceptable pressure relief devices (unless otherwise hazard classified).  For underwater test stands, the TNT equivalence (MCE) should be included in the total energetic liquids weight in all pumps and plumbing, as well as the weight of energetic liquids held in tankage (under the test cell hydrostatic pressure) unless acceptable mitigation measures such as fuel line detonation arrestors and/or fuel tank isolation/barricading are used (as determined by hazard analysis). 11.  Should be used as a default value, unless otherwise hazard classified, when the material is packaged in small vehicle propellant tanks, small (non-bulk) shipping containers, portable ground support equipment, or similar pressure vessels that provide relatively heavy confinement (burst pressure between 50 – 100 psig) without acceptable pressure relief devices. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 313 Table 12.16.

These equivalencies apply also for the following substitutions:  Alcohols or other hydrocarbons for RP-1, H2O2 for LO2 (only when LO2 is in combination with RP-1 or equivalent hydrocarbon fuel), MMH for N2H4, UDMH, or combinations of the two. 4.  For quantities of energetic liquids up to but not over the equivalent of 100 lbs of AE, AFSEC/SEW will determine the distance on an individual basis.  Protect all personnel and facilities, whether involved in the operation or not, by operating procedures, equipment design, shielding, barricading, or other suitable means. 5.  Distances less than ILDare not specified.  Where a number of prepackaged energetic liquid units are stored together, separation distance to other storage facilities will be determined on an individual basis by AFSEC/SEW, taking into consideration normal hazard classification procedures. 6.  For siting launch vehicles and static test stands, explosive equivalent weight is the larger of:  (a) The weight equal to 8W 2/3 where W is the weight of LO2/LH2; or (b) 14 percent of the LO2/LH2 weight.  (For these calculations, use the total weight of LO2/LH2 present in the launch vehicle, or the total weight in test stand run tankage and piping where there is no positive means to prevent mixing in credible mishaps.  When it can be reliably demonstrated that the MCE involves a lesser quantity of energetic liquids subject to involvement in a single reaction, the lesser quantity may be used in determining the explosive equivalent yield.  When siting is based on a quantity less than the total energetic liquids present, document the MCE and associated explosive yield analysis in an approved ESP (see Chapter 14)). 7.  These are hypergolic combinations. 8.  Explosive equivalency of the hybrid rocket system N2O4 liquid oxidizer combined with PBAN (polybutadiene-acrylic acid-acronitrile) solid fuel was evaluated as 15 percent for an explosive donor accident scenario, 5 percent for a high velocity impact scenario, and less than 0.01 percent (negligible) for static mixing (tower drop) failures IAW NFPA 251, Standard Methods of Tests of Endurance of Building Construction and Materials.  9.  See Note 10 of Table 12.15. 10.  See Note 8 of Table 12.15. Table 12.18.  QD Criteria for OSHA/NFPA Class I – III Flammable and Combustible Energetic Liquids Storage in Detached Buildings or Tanks. Notes: 1.  Other guidelines for diking, tank or container construction, tank venting, and facility construction apply (except for Class III B combustible liquids, e.g., Otto Fuel II).  Refer to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for further guidance on liquid storage and fire protection. 2.  Refer to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for definition and explanation of OSHA/NFPA classification of flammable and combustible liquids.  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 315 3.  Guidelines on interior storage configuration (for container storage inside buildings) also apply with the following exceptions;  (a)  If the storage building is located at least 100 feet from any exposed building (under the direct jurisdiction of a fire protection organization) or property line; or (b)  If the storage building is located at least 200 feet from any exposed building (not under the direct jurisdiction of a fire protection organization) or property line; or (c) for combustible liquids that will not exhibit sustained burning in bulk form, e.g., Otto Fuel II, as determined through ASTM D 92 Standard Test Method for Flash and Fire Points by Cleveland Open Cup or comparable testing.  Refer to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code and NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for further guidance on liquid storage and fire protection. 4. For container storage inside of a building, IBD/PTR distances may be less than 50 feet (to a minimum of 10 feet) if the storage building is constructed of fire resistive exterior walls having an NFPA Fire Resistance rating of two hours or more according to NFPA 251, Standard Methods of Tests of Endurance of Building Construction and Materials. 5.  For large tank storage, QD may be 25 feet for tank capacities up to 100,000 gallons, and 37.5 feet for capacities between 100,001 and 500,000 gallons. 6.  For flammable liquids container storage inside of a building, ILD/Aboveground IMD is 50 feet (except as in Note 4), or for adjacent incompatible oxidizer storage, distances specified for energetic liquid oxidizers (Table 12.19.) or oxygen (Table 12.20.).  For flammable liquids storage in fixed or large portable tanks, ILD/Aboveground IMD is either (1) for compatible energetic liquids, equal to one sixth of the sum of the diameters of the two adjacent tanks, or distances specified in Note 5 for adjacent container storage inside of a building; or (2) for adjacent incompatible oxidizer storage, distances specified for energetic liquid oxidizers (Table 12.19.) or oxygen (Table 12.20.).  ECM may be used to their physical capacity for storing flammable energetic liquids provided they comply with the construction and siting requirements of Chapter 6 and Chapter 12, respectively for Hazard Division 1.1.  ECM must be sited for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1 items using Tables 12.7. and 12.1. 316 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Table 12.19.  QD Criteria for Energetic Liquid Oxidizer (excluding Liquid Oxygen) Storage in Detached Buildings or Tanks.  Notes: 1.  QD requirements do not apply to the storage of NFPA Class 2 and 3 oxidizers when all requirements of NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers, have been met.   2.  Other requirements for interior storage configuration, building construction, diking, container materials, facility venting, etc. also apply.  Refer to NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for further guidance on oxidizer storage and fire protection. 3.  Refer to NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers for definition and explanation of NFPA classification of oxidizers.   4.  Multiple tanks containing NFPA Class 4 oxidizers may be located at distances less than those specified in the table; however, if the tanks are not separated from each other by 10 percent of the distance specified for the largest tank, then the total contents of all tanks are used to calculate distances to other exposures. 5.  The equations given below may be used to determine distance/weights for other quantities: Quantity (W) in lbs, distance in feet W ≤ 10,000 lbs:Distance = 149.3 x W(-0.41+0.059*ln (W)) W > 10,000 lbs:Distance = 24 x W1/3 Distance > 75 feet: W = exp [-134.286 + 71.998 x (ln (Distance)) – 12.363 x (ln (Distance))2 + 0.7229 x (ln AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 317 (Distance))3] 6.  NFPA 430 requires sprinkler protection be provided for storage of greater than 2,000 lbs of NFPA Class 4 oxidizers inside of a building (NFPA 430, Code for the Storage of Liquid and Solid Oxidizers). Table 12.20.  QD Criteria for Liquid Oxygen Storage in Detached Buildings or Tanks.  Notes: 1.  Per NFPA 251, Standard Methods of Tests of Endurance of Building Construction and Materials, distances do not apply where a protective structure having an NFPA fire resistance rating of at least two hours interrupts the line of sight between the oxygen system and the exposure.  Refer to 29 CFR Subpart H Part 1910 and NFPA 50, Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites for further guidance. 2.  Additional guidelines relating to equipment assembly and installation, facility design (diking), and other fire protection issues also apply.  Refer to 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart H – Hazardous Materials, current edition and NFPA 50, Standard for Bulk Oxygen Systems at Consumer Sites for further guidance. 3.  QD is independent of oxygen quantity. 4.  Minimum ILD/IMD distance between adjacent compatible energetic liquids storage is 50 feet. 318 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Table 12.21.  QD Criteria for Liquid Hydrogen and Bulk Quantities of Hydrazines.  Notes: 1.  Take positive measures to prevent mixing of hydrogen or hydrazine’s and adjacent oxidizers in the event of a leak or spill.  2.  Distances are necessary to provide reasonable protection from fragments of tanks or equipment that is expected to be thrown in event of a vapor phase explosion. 3.

The term “protected” means that protection from fragments is provided by terrain, effective barricades, nets, or other physical means. 5.  Distances are based on the recommended IBD given in DTR 4500.9-R-Part II and extrapolation of the two cal/cm2 data on the one percent water vapor curve.   AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 319 W < 100 lbs:  Protected Distance = 80 feet 100 lbs <W: Protected Distance = -154.1 + 72.89 x [ln (W)] – 6.675 x [ln (W)]2 + 0.369 x [ln (W)]3 80 feet < Protected Distance:    W = exp [311.367 – 215.761 x (ln (protected distance)) + 55.1828 x (ln (protected distance))2 – 6.1099 x (ln (protected distance))3 + 0.25343 x (ln (protected distance))4] W: is in lbs, distance: is in feet 6.  ILD/Aboveground IMD distances in this column apply for adjacent compatible (ELCG LB or LC) storage; for adjacent incompatible (other ELCG) storage, use IBD distances shown in previous columns.  ECMs may be used to their physical capacity for storing hydrogen provided they comply with the construction and siting requirements of Chapters 6 and 12, respectively for HD 1.1.  ECM must be sited for a minimum of 100 lbs of HD 1.1 items using Tables 12.7. and 12.1. 7.  Distances are 37.5 percent of “protected” column. 8.  Extrapolations above 1,000,000 lbs extend well outside data included in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 77, Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace, current edition where the original QD tables were derived; however, they are supported by independent calculations and knowledge of like phenomena.

This table may be applied from the front, sides and rear of a Second Generation HAS, and from the sides of a Korean Flow-Through HAS.  Apply default QD criteria from the front and rear of a Korean Flow-Through HAS. 2.  Base separations on shelter doors remaining closed, except for aircraft towing, fueling, servicing, run up, or taxi, and during concurrent servicing operations or short periods when maintenance equipment or munitions are moved into or out of shelters.  If doors are left open for extended periods, normal CAPA (per Tables 12.1., 12.2. and 12.3.) apply from the front. 3.  Separate AE from the HAS walls by a distance sufficient to prevent breaching.

Purpose.  This  Chapter  complements  DoD  6055.09-M,  CJCSI  4360.01A,  and  provides explosives safety and munitions risk management (ESMRM) requirements for: 13.1.1.  Non-enduring  locations  (e.g.,  contingency  bases)  established  or  tasked  to  support Joint or Multinational combat and contingency operations.  Due to the hostile environment inherent to operations at Contingency Operating Bases (COB) and Combat Outposts (COP), the  Geographical  Combatant  Commander  (GCC)  provides  specific  guidance  on  risk  and consequence  management  from  military  munitions  at  these  locations.    Apply  procedural requirements of CJCSI  4360.01A relating to ESMRM to COBs and COPs when the GCC determines it appropriate, given all operational and force protection considerations. Note:  The GCC may authorize the application of CJCSI 4360.01A for enduring locations under their command. 13.1.2.  Aerial  ports  of  embarkation/debarkation  (APOE/APOD),  seaports  of  embarkation/ debarkation (SPOE/SPOD), and enroute infrastructure support facilities (DoD and non-DoD controlled) that are used to support GCC operational plans. 13.1.3.  Combat and contingency training. 13.1.4.  U.S.  Northern  Command  (USNORTHCOM)/North  American  Aerospace  Defense Command (NORAD) operations inside the US. 13.2.  Applicability. 13.2.1.  In addition to applicability of paragraph  13.1., this Chapter also applies to: 13.2.1.1.  Subunified commands, joint task forces (JTF), and their subordinate component commands. 13.2.1.2.  DoD Construction Agents (e.g., US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Naval Facilities  Engineering  Command  (NAVFAC),  and  Air  Force  Civil  Engineer  Center (AFCEC)),  Contract  Construction  Agents  (CCAs),  and  other  designated  DoD organizations  (e.g.,  Defense  Contract  Management  Agency  (DCMA),  troop  labor  (Air Force  Prime  BEEF,  Naval  Construction  Battalions,  J3  Engineers) in construction, construction management, or contract award/management  of construction related activities of AE-related facilities or facilities within quantity distance (QD) arcs of AE facilities. 13.2.1.3.  Combat training and contingency training, when specifically authorized by an Air Component Commander or GCC. involved 13.2.2.  This Chapter does not apply to: 13.2.2.1.  Enduring installations outside the US and DoD installations within the US (e.g., Main  Operating  Bases  (MOB)).    The  Air  Force  will  use  this  Manual  for  enduring locations. 342 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Note:  The GCC may authorize the application of CJCSI 4360.01A for enduring locations under their command. 13.2.2.2.

Joint and Multinational Planning. 13.3.1.  As outlined in Figure 13.1. below and further expanded in CJCSI 4360.01A, GCC, Functional Combatant Commanders (See Joint Publication 1-0, Joint Personnel Support) and Air Component Commanders must: 13.3.1.1.  Integrate ESMRM into joint planning and existing plans. (T-0). 13.3.1.2.  Integrate ESMRM requirements into Multinational planning and existing plans. (T-0). 13.3.1.3.  Validate IAW planning cycle’s Joint and Multinational plans during planning exercises. (T-0).  When training exercises show the need to modify or update plans and supporting assumptions based on munitions-risks, update and modify plans to incorporate validated changes. 13.3.2.  Assess  S/APOD  and  S/APOE  and  en  route  infrastructure  identified  in  the  joint planning process as detailed in CJCSI 4360.01A. (T-0). 13.4.  Joint  and  Multinational  Training.  During the planning phase and prior to conduct of this  training,  conduct  and  approve  a  risk  analysis  that  thoroughly  assesses  the  risk  and consequences associated with the training as directed by CJCSI 4360.01A. (T-0).  13.5.  Joint and Multinational ESMRM Execution. 13.5.1.  The Base Operating Support Integrator (BOS-I) plays a critical role in the execution of explosives safety and ESMRM with regards to Joint and Multinational installation master planning and real estate and infrastructure management.  The following major areas must be addressed by the BOS-I: (T-1). 13.5.1.1.  Determination of explosives safety requirements to be used. 13.5.1.2.  Land and infrastructure use management. 13.5.1.3.  Explosives Safety Quantity Distance (ESQD) mapping. 13.5.1.4.  Explosives site planning. 13.5.1.5.  Conduct  of  ESMRM  Consequence  and  Risk (C&RI) Assessments when explosives safety requirements cannot be met and ensuring approval at the appropriate level. 13.5.1.6.  Risk  and  consequence  management,  to  include  communication  of  risk decisions. Identification AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 343 13.5.1.7.  Planning for risks and potential consequences from the unintended functioning of munitions, to include coordination of force protection and explosives safety mitigation. 13.5.1.8.  Construction management.  All construction that increases hazards regardless of  funding  (e.g.,  Operations  and  Maintenance,  Army  (OMA),  military  construction (MILCON))  must  have  either  an  ESP  or  an  approved  deviation  before  construction begins. (T-1).  All construction within or on the periphery of ESQD arcs must be closely managed  and    coordinated,  as  early  as  possible  in  the  planning  and  design  phase,  to ensure compliance with explosives safety requirements. 13.5.2.  Approved ESP or event waiver.  All locations where military munitions are present or forecasted to be present must have an approved ESP or event waiver. (T-1).  With respect to COBs and COPs, the GCC determines appropriate requirements (see paragraph 13.1.1.). 13.5.2.1.  For  locations  meeting  explosives  safety  requirements.    The  site  approval process decision matrix is shown below in Figure 13.2.  ESP packages will be prepared IAW Chapter 14. (T-1). 13.5.2.2.  For  locations  which  cannot  be  sited  IAW  Chapter  14,  conduct  an  ESMRM C&RI  assessment  and  obtain  deviation  approval  from  the  appropriate  authority,  as detailed in CJSCI 4360.01A.  The deviation process decision matrix is shown below in Figure 13.3. 13.5.3.  Consider the following location examples for ESP approval: 13.5.3.1.  Storage locations (e.g., open location, pad, and structure). 13.5.3.2.  Holding  areas  (e.g.,  basic load  ammunition  holding  areas  (BLAHA), ammunition holding area (AHA), field return holding, flightline holding areas, port and railhead  holding  areas,  and  marshaling  areas,  S/APOD  and  S/APOE  and  en  route infrastructure). 13.5.3.3.  Handling  and  operating  locations  (e.g.,  combat/cargo  aircraft  and  remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) loading areas, ports, AE maintenance, repair, and renovation areas and sling-out areas, tenant operations). 13.5.3.4.  Parking  locations  (even  temporary)  for  vehicles  carrying  AE  and  located outside an established BLAHA/AHA. 13.5.3.5.  Locations used for tactical assembly areas, AE field returns, amnesty returns, casualty AE collection (e.g., outside a hospital), etc. 13.5.3.6.  AE-loaded combat and cargo aircraft parking areas. 13.5.3.7.  Static missile systems. 13.5.3.8.  Locations  used  for  the  treatment  or  disposal  (e.g.,  open  burn  or  open detonation) of munitions. 13.5.3.9.  Inhabited ESs within ESQD arcs. 13.5.3.10.  Future/planned  construction  pertaining  to  AE  locations,  regardless  of  what they are used for, to include planned exposed sites (ES) that will be constructed within ESQD arcs. 344 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 13.5.4.  Approval process for MILCON that cannot meet explosives safety  requirements is addressed in Section 1B of this Manual. 13.6.  Specific Explosives Safety Criteria. 13.6.1.  Limited quantities of hazard division (HD) 1.2.2, HD 1.3, or HD 1.4. 13.6.1.1.  For  reasons  of  operational  necessity,  and  IAW  Chapter  11  of  this  Manual, limited quantities of HD 1.2.2, HD 1.3, or HD 1.4 may be stored and used in operations without regard to QD and ESP approval. 13.6.1.2.  The above is applicable to armored vehicles located outside a BLAHA/AHA. 13.6.2.  QD Reduction Using Concertainer Barricades. 13.6.2.1.  Ensure fill material for concertainer barricades is reasonably cohesive and free from harmful (toxic) matter, trash, debris, and stones heavier than ten pounds.  Locate stones  at  the  lower  center  of  the  barricade.    The  preferred  hill  material  is  a  granular material, such as sandy soil. 13.6.2.2.  Inspection  of  these  type  barricades  will  be  conducted  on  a  periodic  basis  to insure  their  integrity  and  stability.  (T-1).    Deteriorating  or  damaged  sections  will  be replaced.  (T-1). 13.6.2.3.  DDESB has approved the use of a concertainer barricade design for prevention of prompt propagation between munitions storage cells, each containing up to 8,818 lbs net explosive weight (NEW) of AE with a reduced IMD of 28 feet versus the required default IMD (K6) criteria of 126 feet.  The following apply to this approval: (T-1). 13.6.2.3.1.  Each storage cell is restricted to a maximum of 8,818lbs NEW of mixed HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 (sensitivity group 1 through 5), HD 1.3, and HD 1.4 AE.  The MCE associated with any storage arrangement constructed per the Technical Paper 15 is one storage cell. When determining NEW for QD (NEWQD) for the cell, HD 1.4 may be excluded, as it will not contribute to the severity of an explosion were one to occur. 13.6.2.3.2.  Use the "Open" column of Table 12.4. for determining appropriate QD for the NEWQD that is present, when in the open or in a structure that cannot stop primary  fragments.    If  in  a  hardened  structure  that  is  capable  of  stopping  primary fragments, use "Structure" column.  Refer to Table 12.4. for additional details. 13.6.2.3.3.  Maintain a minimum of 10 feet standoff from the munitions stack to the nearest concertainer barricade. 13.6.2.3.4.  Section 6E—prescribes height and length requirements. 13.6.2.4.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) concertainer barricade criteria. 13.6.2.4.1.  NATO  AASTP-5,  NATO  Guidelines  for  the  storage,  Maintenance  and Transport of Ammunition on Deployed Missions or Operations, provides criteria for AE storage of up to 8,818 lbs of AE in barricaded cells, with reduced QD.  Those criteria provide QD for ES outside the camp/base.  In addition, the criteria provide appropriate QD for the protection of personnel/ES inside the camp/base, from PES AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 345 fragments, debris, and blast, as well as ES building collapse, in consideration of PES and ES designs (i.e., open, light, semi-hardened, hardened). 13.6.2.4.2.  Paragraph  13.8.3.  addresses  the  use  of  NATO  criteria  by  US  Forces participating in NATO Multational operations.  NATO AASTP-5 criteria can also be used by US Forces outside of NATO Multinational operations, as allowed by the Air Force. 13.6.3.  Fuel storage.  Certain operations may require large amounts of on-site, operational fuel quantities.  Limit operational fuel needs to the Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ) only.  The installation Commander must approve the documented basis for arriving at the MEQ. (T-1).    However,  in  almost  all  other  cases,  the  following  operational  fuel  limits  and separation distances will meet the operational fuel needs and must be applied: (T-1). 13.6.3.1.  Separate quantities up to 500 gallons from PES by at least 50 feet. 13.6.3.2.  Separate quantities between 500 to 5,000 gallons from PES by at least 100 feet. 13.6.3.3.  For bulk storage (i.e., greater than 5,000 gallons), apply paragraph 12.79. 13.6.3.4.  For further protection from an accidental explosion at a PES and to provide fire protection to surrounding PES/ES, barricade fuel storage locations.  If designed properly, the  barricade  also  serves  as  a  dike  in  the  event  of  a  fuel  leak.    Separate  fueling trucks/tankers, when not being used, from PES by barricades. 13.6.4.  Emergency Destruction.  Follow guidance as set forth in paragraph 4.20.  Conduct normal disposal operations IAW Section 12O. 13.6.5.  Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA). 13.6.5.1.  Store  CEA  at  a  minimum  of  IMD,  but  preferably  IBD,  from  all  other  AE stocks.  CEA must not be co-located (i.e., same cell) with DoD AE. (T-1). 13.6.5.2.  Manage  CEA  collected  for  exploitation  IAW  DoDDS-3325.01,  Foreign Material  Program,  and  DoDI  S-3325.04,  Implementation  of  the  Foreign  Material Program. (T-0). 13.6.6.  Mixing of DoD AE with Multinational AE.  Do not assume that Multinational AE is hazard classified  IAW the United Nations' international system of classification developed for the transport of dangerous goods, IAW ST/SG/AC.10/1/Revision 17, Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations, Volumes I and II, which is the basis  for  US  hazard  classification,  as  outlined  in  Chapter  3.    Also,  do  not  assume  that Multinational Nations conduct/manage AE surveillance or propellant stability test programs to ensure the safety of their AE items.  For those reasons, unless it's specifically known that Multinational  Nations  have  such  programs  and  that  they  are  actively  managed/monitored, then  do  not  store  AE  from  those  Nations  with  DoD  AE.  (T-1).    The  following  apply  to mixing of DoD AE with Multinational AE: 13.6.6.1.  Multinational AE may be stored at the same site (e.g., building, pad) with DoD AE provided the owner(s) of the DoD AE accepts the risk and consequences of storing nonDoD ammunition with DoD ammunition and the involved nation(s)'AE: 13.6.6.1.1.  Has  been  hazard  classified  in  a  manner  equivalent  to  DoD  explosives hazard classification procedures and as outlined in Chapter 3. 346 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 13.6.6.1.2.  Is  managed/monitored  as  part  of  both  AE  surveillance  and  propellant stability test programs. 13.6.6.1.3.  Is packaged/stored in a manner that meets DoD standards. 13.6.6.2.  Separate  Multinational  AE  that  does  not  meet  all  requirements  of  paragraph  13.6.6.1. from DoD AE by a minimum of IMD. (T-1). 13.6.7.  Concurrent  DoD  and  Multinational  AE  Operations.    The  following  criteria  govern such operations: 13.6.7.1.  Separate  concurrent  DoD  and  Multinational  AE  operations  (e.g.,  ammunition issues, returns, inspections) by a minimum of ILD. (T-1). 13.6.7.2.  Non-concurrent  DoD  and  Multinational  AE  operations  may  be  performed  on the same pad, site, or facility provided the AE of the first party is removed prior to the second party beginning AE operations. 13.6.7.3.  Provide ILD level of protection to AE operations (DoD or Multinational) from AE storage sites (DoD or MN). (T-1). 13.6.7.4.  Provide  IMD  level  of  protection  to  AE  storage  sites  (DoD  or  Multinational) from AE operations (DoD or Multinational). (T-1). 13.7.  DDESB  TP-15.  TP-15  consolidates  into  one  document  the  protective  construction approved  by  the  DDESB.    It  describes  past  solutions  that  were  developed  to  address  specific problems  being  experienced  by  DoD  Components,  particularly  to  reducing  the  MCE  and associated QD criteria.  Appendix 2 was written specifically to incorporate all items that could benefit the operational theater in the areas of storage and operations. 13.8.  Application  of  Explosives  Safety  Requirement  Other  than  DoDM  6055.09-M  and AFMAN  91-201.  DoD  policy  and  Joint  Chief  of  Staff  (JCS)  guidance  with  respect  to  the application of other explosives safety criteria is as follows: 13.8.1.  Comply with DoDM 6055.09-M and this Manual, and when outside the U.S., comply with  host-nation,  Multinational,  or  U.S.  explosives  safety  standards,  whichever  are  more stringent unless standards applicability is mandated in an International Agreement (IA). (T-1). 13.8.2.  Joint  Publication  (JP)  3-16,  Multinational  Operations,  advises  Commanders  of  US forces operating as part of a Multinational (alliance or coalition) military command that they must  follow  Multinational  doctrine  and  procedures  ratified  by  the  U.S.    For  doctrine  and procedures not ratified by the U.S., Commanders must evaluate and follow the Multinational command's  doctrine  and  procedures,  where  applicable  and  consistent  with  US  law, regulations, and doctrine. (T-0). 13.8.3.  NATO. 13.8.3.1.  NATO explosives safety requirements are found in Allied Ammunition Storage and Transport Publication (AASTP)-1 and AASTP-5, both of which have been ratified by the U.S. for use by U.S. forces during NATO Multinational operations. 13.8.3.2.  NATO  requirements  may  be  mandated  for  use  in  an  IA  or  as  part  of  a Multinational operation. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 347 13.8.3.3.  AFSEC/SEW  and  DDESB  accepts  an  ESP  based  on  the  QD  contained  in AASTP-1, AASTP-5, and developed by US forces participating in NATO Multinational operations. 13.8.3.4.  United Nations (UN) International Ammunition Technical Guidelines (IATG). 13.8.3.4.1.  The UN has developed explosives safety technical guidance referred to as the IATG.  UN requirements may be mandated for use in an IA or as part of a UN Multinational operation. 13.8.3.4.2.  IATG  QD  requirements  are  similar  to  NATO  QD  requirements  of Reference (n). 13.8.3.4.3.  DoD and Air Forces’ explosives safety programs fully meet the highest level of compliance (Level 3) described in the IATG. Figure 13.1.

Purpose  of  Explosives  Site  Planning.  Explosives  site  planning  is  a  process  used  to manage the risks associated with explosives activities to ensure the minimum risk to personnel, equipment, and assets, while meeting mission requirements. 14.1.1.  Planning for the proper location and construction of PESs, and ESs exposed to PESs, is a key element of the explosives site planning process. 14.1.2.  This  process  also  ensures  that  risks  above  those  normally  accepted  for  explosives activities  are  identified  and  presented  to  the  appropriate  Commander  for  approval.    The explosives site planning process is applicable to enduring and non-enduring locations (See Chapter 13). 14.2.  Responsibilities  for  Explosives  Site  Planning.  Safety,  in  coordination  with  civil engineering,  fire,  health,  security,  and  environmental  agencies,  is  responsible  for  performing explosives site planning. Section 14B—Explosives Clear Zones 14.3.  Explosives Clear Zones. 14.3.1.  The  explosives  clear  zone  is  the  area  surrounding  a  PES  as  determined  by  the required IB separation. 14.3.2.  The  IB  separation  is  based  on  the  sited,  waivered,  exempted,  or  actual  explosives limits of the potential explosion site, whichever is greatest. 14.4.  Monitoring of Explosives Clear Zones. 14.4.1.  Safety  and  civil  engineering  will  monitor  and  control  construction  and  facility utilization inside explosives clear zones. (T-1). 14.4.2.  Management of explosives safety clear zones is a cornerstone of the explosives site planning process. 14.5.  Mapping Requirements for Explosives Clear Zones. 14.5.1.  Explosives clear zones for all approved explosives site plans (ESP) s will be reflected on the installation Comprehensive Plan Maps IAW AFI 32-7062. (T-1). 14.5.2.  Explosives clear zones must reflect the DDESB-approved NEW and IB distance. (T-1). 14.5.3.  The  WSM  assists  civil  engineering  in  determining  the  explosives  clear  zones required on appropriate base maps. 14.5.4.  Do not change explosives clear zones on base maps when they are expanded for a short-term situation (one year or less), such as an event waiver lasting less than a year. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 351 14.6.  Elimination of Explosives Clear Zones. 14.6.1.  Cancel  the  ESP  used  to  establish  an  explosives  clear  zone  when  the  use  of  an explosives location is no longer required. (T-1). 14.6.2.  Submit  the  ESP  cancelation  memorandum  to  the  MAJCOM  safety  office.  (T-1).  MAJCOM safety office forwards a copy of the ESP cancelation to AFSEC/SEW. Section 14C—Explosives Site Plans (ESP) 14.7.  ESPs.  ESPs are a method to document the results of the explosives site planning process. 14.7.1.  An ESP package consists of all the information necessary to assess compliance with explosives safety standards. 14.7.2.  Once approved, the ESP identifies storage and operational limitations, and provides a tool for managing risks associated with the storage or operating location. 14.7.3.  The term ESP is synonymous with Quantity Distance Safety Submission (QDSS) and Hybrid Safety Submission (HSS). 14.8.  Funding for Projects Requiring an ESP. 14.8.1.  Prior to approval of an ESP, expend only limited Air Force funds on the ESP project.  ESP approval is covered in paragraph 14.15. 14.8.2.  All funds spent prior to approval may be placed at risk if explosives safety standards are not followed properly.  The investment could be lost if ESP approval is contingent on changes  or  new  facility  requirements  that  were  not  considered  or  adequately  addressed during the ESP preparation and review process. 14.8.3.  It  is  strongly  suggested  that  at  least  preliminary  ESP  approval  be  obtained  before awarding a contract for new construction of explosives facilities or non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone (see paragraph 14.13.). 14.9.  Situations Requiring an ESP.  Develop and submit ESPs for review and approval for the following situations: (T-1).  14.9.1.  New construction of explosives facilities. 14.9.2.  New construction of non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone. 14.9.3.  Modification or change to the use of explosives facilities per paragraph 14.11. 14.9.4.  Modification or change to the use of non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone per paragraph 14.11. 14.9.5.  Recurring  training  and  exercise  explosives  activities  occurring  in  fixed  locations, except as allowed in paragraph 14.10.9. 14.10.  Situations Not Requiring an ESP.  ESPs are not required for the following situations: (T-1).  14.10.1.  Storage and associated HD 1.4S handling (see paragraph 12.29.3.). 14.10.2.  Interchange yards limited to those operations described in paragraph 12.58. 352 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 14.10.3.  Inspection  stations  where  only  the  operations  described  in  paragraph  12.57.  are performed. 14.10.4.  Parking  aircraft  loaded  with  specific  munitions,  while  the  aircraft  is  located  in designated  aircraft  parking  areas  that  meet  airfield  criteria  (see  paragraph  12.47.).    This includes associated handling of these munitions, provided the quantity of munitions involved in the operation is limited to a single aircraft load. 14.10.5.  Hung ordnance areas, arm or de-arm areas, and hot pit refueling areas not used as parking areas, unless they are located in an explosives clear zone (see paragraph 12.44. and  12.45.).  In that case site areas as a non-explosives exposed site. 14.10.6.  Licensed explosives storage locations, unless they are located in an explosives clear zone.  In that case site locations as a non-explosives exposed site. 14.10.7.  Explosives operations associated with licensed explosives storage locations. 14.10.8.  Inert storage accessed by personnel related to the explosives mission. 14.10.9.  Activation of simulators and smoke-producing devices in single or small quantities when used in conjunction with exercises and training (to include readiness inspections).  See paragraph 7.25. for guidance. 14.10.10.  Unmanned, non-explosives miscellaneous structures requiring only fire protection distance separation do not require an ESP, even if new construction is involved. 14.10.11.  All non-enduring locations as defined by the Geographic Combatant Commander (GCC)  that cannot be sited IAW this Manual will have an ESMRM C&RI assessment IAW CJCSI 4360.01A, Enclosure C (see Chapter 13). 14.11.  Facility  Modifications  or  Change  in  Use.  Existing  explosives  facilities  and  exposed facilities  within  explosives  clear  zones  may  require  modification  or  change  in  use  to  meet changing mission requirements.  Evaluate such modifications and changes in use to determine if they affect the application of explosives safety requirements as approved in the original ESP. 14.11.1.  Develop  and  submit  a  new  ESP  if  the  facility  modification  or  change  in  use involves the following: (T-1). 14.11.1.1.  A  change  in  the  classification  of  the  facility  for  QD  purposes  (e.g.,  an explosive storage facility is changed to an operating location). 14.11.1.2.  Changes in HD, NEWQD or NEW for intentional detonation sites. 14.11.1.3.  Changes impacting the explosives clear zone (increase or reduction). 14.11.1.4.  Increase in overall floor space, to include vertical additions. 14.11.1.5.  Introduction of additional personnel performing a different function. 14.11.1.6.  Compromise of the effectiveness of built-in safety  features (e.g., opening is made in a SDW). 14.11.1.7.  The installation of a new LPS (e.g., the complete replacement of an existing system or replacing an integral system with a mast or catenary system). 14.11.2.  For  other  modifications  or  changes  in  use  submit  a  memorandum  describing  the facility modification or change in use to the MAJCOM. (T-1).  The MAJCOM will ensure AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 353 the facility modification or change in use does not affect the explosives safety criteria applied in the original ESP and submits the change to AFSEC/SEW to formally amend the ESP. (T-1). 14.11.3.  Do not start construction on a project requiring an ESP until approval is granted by the  DDESB.  (T-1).    For  ESPs  where  no  construction  is  involved,  do  not  start  explosives operations  or  non-explosives  operations  within  explosives  clear  zones  until  the  ESP  is approved by the DDESB. (T-1). 14.12.  ESP Development and Installation-Level Coordination. 14.12.1.  The  civil  engineer  or  facility  user  notifies  weapons  safety  as  soon  as  a  need  is identified  to  build,  modify,  or  change  the  use  of  any  explosives  facility  or  non-explosives facility located within an explosives clear zone. (T-1).  Weapons safety determines the need for an ESP and solicits the information to prepare the request. 14.12.2.  The civil engineer  assists safety in development of the  ESP by providing  current maps or drawings and technical facility design assistance.  Also, the civil engineer supplies facility  design  information  such  as  construction,  grounding,  technical  facility  design assistance, and LPS information. 14.12.3.  Site  for  maximum  weights  based  on  actual  separation  distances  or  capacity  for storage locations; however, for other locations site for MEQ/operational limits. (T-1). 14.12.4.  Coordinate  the  ESP  with  civil  engineering  and  the  user.    Coordinate  with  fire, health, security, legal and environmental agencies, as appropriate. 14.12.5.  Coordinate the ESP with bioenvironmental engineering if it involves biological and chemical  fillers,  liquid  propellants,  toxic  gases,  sonic  hazard  areas,  any  form  of electromagnetic radiation, laser or other directed energy weapons (DEW) affecting health or the  environment  on-base  (including  radioactive  sources  and  microwave  generators  and industrial x-ray).  The  MAJCOM will forward  an information  copy of  the ESP to the Air Force Medical Support Agency (AFMSA/SG3PB), 1400 Key Blvd, Suite 400, Arlington VA 22209. (T-1). 14.12.6.  When tenant facilities, including those of other services, are exposed, coordinate the ESP with the tenant unit.  For ESPs that expose host-nation tenant facilities or areas, notify the  host-nation  Commander  of  the  exposure  and  obtain  host-nation  approval,  taking  into account any notification or approval requirements in international agreements or SOFA. (T-1). 14.12.7.  In  cases  where  the  explosives  clear  zone  encroaches  onto  adjacent  government agencies, such as another Air Force, or an Army, Navy or Marine installation, obtain written acknowledgement from the exposed service component for inclusion in the ESP. (T-1). Note:  It will be up to the acknowledging agency to update their maps to reflect the explosives clear zone for their future planning purposes. 14.12.8.  Review  and  approve  ESPs  involving  contractors  through  the  Defense  Plant Representative  Office  (DPRO),  Administrative Contract  Office  (ACO)  and  the  Designated Acquisition Official’s (DAO) safety office prior to Air Force processing. (T-1).  Local level coordinates with responsible contracting officer. 354 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 14.13.  ESP  Contents.  ESPs  contain  the  information  described  in  Section  14D.    In  some instances, a compressed  timeline (such as that imposed by  the design and build process) may require contract award or site preparation activities (e.g., facility demolition, grading or other site preparation)  before  all  of  the  information  required  in  Section  14D  is  available.    In  these instances,  request  preliminary  ESP  approval.    Preliminary  ESPs  will  include  the  information required in Section 14D, except for  facility construction drawings  and any  required structural engineering analyses. (T-1).  Specifically address the action required for approval (e.g. contract award, facility demolition).  Submit a request for final ESP approval as soon as the construction drawings and any required structural engineering analyses are completed. (T-1). 14.14.  ESP Submission and MAJCOM and Air Force-Level Coordination Process. 14.14.1.  The ESP originates at the installation level (See paragraph 14.26.).  The primary means  for  originating  an  ESP  is  the  automated  Explosives  Safety  Siting  ESP  Program.  MAJCOM/SEW  reviews  the  ESP  for  accuracy  and  compliance  with  the  standards  in  this Manual and applicable MAJCOM supplements.  MAJCOMs then electronically submit the coordinated  ESP  to  AFSEC/SEW  (unless  the  ESP  is  approved  by  the  MAJCOM  per paragraph  14.15.).    Include  a  MAJCOM  endorsement  stating  approval  along  with  any changes,  modifications  or  specific  precautionary  measures  considered  necessary.    After review by AFSEC/SEW, the ESP is endorsed and electronically submitted to the DDESB for approval.    Reviewing  agencies  provide  the  ESP  originator  and  previous  review  agency  a copy  of  comments  or  changes  made  affecting  the  original  intent  of  the  ESP.  (T-1).    Any change  affecting  the  content  of  the  unit’s  Automated  Explosives  Safety  Siting  Program database requires updates made at the unit. (T-1). Note:  For nuclear weapons capable facilities, AFSEC/SEW ensures the Air Force Nuclear Safety Design Certification Program has been completed prior to ESP submission to the DDESB (See AFI 91-103). 14.14.2.  Air Force Host to Tenant Relationships.  ESPs for tenant units are sent through host installation and tenant command channels.  In cases where the host violates ESQD to a tenant facility,  the  host  MAJCOM  obtains  coordination  from  the  tenant  MAJCOM  before processing the ESP.  Where no violation exists, provide an information copy of the ESP to the tenant MAJCOM when processing to AFSEC/SEW.  If required by the tenant MAJCOM, the ESP must meet the requirements of the tenant MAJCOM supplement to this Manual. (T-1). 14.14.3.  Inter-service Host to Tenant Relationships. 14.14.3.1.  When an Air Force unit is tenant on an Army, Navy or Marine installation, request  ESP  approval  through  that  service.  (T-1).    The  ESP  must  meet  the  QD requirements  of  this  Manual  in  addition  to  all  host  agency  criteria.  (T-1).    Submit  an information copy of the ESP request through the MAJCOM to AFSEC/SEW. (T-1). 14.14.3.2.  Tenant Army, Navy or Marine units forward ESP requests through Air Force host installation channels. (T-1).  Air Force host assists tenant units in preparing the ESP.  In cases where the Air Force host violates ESQD to a tenant facility, the host MAJCOM obtains  coordination  from  the  tenant  MAJCOM  equivalent  before  processing  the  ESP.  Where  no  violation  exists,  provide  an  information  copy  of  the  ESP  to  the  tenant MAJCOM equivalent when processing to AFSEC/SEW. (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 355 14.14.3.3.  AFSEC/SEW  will  coordinate  with  the  applicable  service  component  before processing the ESP. (T-1).  In cases where the Air Force host violates ESQD to a tenant facility, AFSEC/SEW obtains coordination from the applicable service component before processing the ESP. (T-1).  Where no violation exists, an information copy of the ESP is sent to the applicable service component when processing for final approval. 14.14.4.  AFSEC/SEW  coordinates  requests  for  ESP  approval  with  the  applicable  service component  if  an  Air  Force  explosives  clear  zone  encroaches  onto  an  adjacent  Air  Force, Army, Navy or Marine installation. (T-1). 14.14.5.  MAJCOM/SEW  may  request  expeditious  AFSEC/SEW  processing  of  an  ESP.  Requests for expeditious ESP processing will include the information required in paragraph 14.22.19. (T-1). 14.14.6.  Nuclear  facilities  must  undergo  a  nuclear  certification  process  prior  to  ESP submission (See AFI 63-125, Nuclear Certification Program). (T-1). 14.15.  ESP Approval. 14.15.1.  Except as authorized in paragraph 14.15.2., ESPs are approved by DDESB.  ESPs with waivers or exemptions are submitted as HSSs to the DDESB for final approval IAW Section 1B.  Do not start new construction until authorized by an approved ESP. (T-1).  Do not commence explosives operations or events unless authorized by an approved deviation IAW  paragraph  1.4.  (T-1).   Deviation  documentation  requirements  prescribed  in paragraph 1.4.3. are addressed in the ESP submission to the MAJCOM and AFSEC/SEW. 14.15.1.1.  Once the ESP is reviewed by AFSEC/SEW, AFSEC/SEW submits the ESP to the DDESB or back to the MAJCOM if additional information is needed to gain DDESB approval. 14.15.1.2.  If additional criteria is needed to complete the ESP package, provide it  within 45 days of AFSEC/SEW initial review comments or provide notification to AFSEC/SEW from the MAJCOM with a status of delay and an estimated response date. (T-1). 14.15.1.3.  If  continued  delays  are  encountered,  AFSEC/SEW  will  return  the  ESP  as disapproved  with  a  detailed  explanation  of  the  reason  for  disapproval.  (T-1).    At  this time, the deviation for operations to commence is invalidated.  The entire ESP may be resubmitted under a new control number once all criteria are met and included in the ESP submission. Note:  If included in the ESP request, preliminary ESP approval may authorize some construction planning activities to begin per paragraph 14.13. 14.15.2.  Approval levels for unique situations are as follows: 14.15.2.1.  ESPs  for  training  and  exercise  areas  using  flares,  simulators,  and  smoke producing devices (HD 1.2.2, 1.3 and 1.4 only), and not within an established clear zone, are approved by the MAJCOM.  This applies to recurring training locations and not to exercise  support  activities  that  move  each  time  IAW  exercise  scenarios.    Document required separation distances per paragraph 7.25. for exercise support activities that do not have a fixed location. (T-1). 356 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 14.15.2.2.  MAJCOM/SEWs  approve  ESPs  for  installation  of  WSVs  in  HASs  with previously approved ESPs by the MAJCOM/SEW. 14.15.2.3.  The  PCO  for  Air  Force  contracts  involving  explosives  or  ammunition approves  ESPs  for  Contractor  Owned  Contractor  Operated  (COCO)  facilities  on  non-government land.  The contractor prepares and submits these ESPs.  Do not forward these ESPs  to  either  AFMC/SEW,  AFSEC/SEW,  or  the  DDESB.    The  Defense  Contract Management  Agency  evaluates  the  ESP  and  provides  approval  or  disapproval recommendations to the PCO. 14.15.2.4.  The  DDESB  approves  ESPs  for  Government  Owned  Contractor  Operated (GOCO) facilities and COCO facilities on government land.  Waivers and exemptions are approved by the responsible PCO and Air Force command level as prescribed in Chapter 1. 14.15.2.5.  The DDESB approves ESPs for non-DoD explosives activities on Air Force installations per paragraph 14.17. 14.16.  Maintenance  of  Approved  ESPs.  Approved  ESPs  (including  the  approval  letter)  are maintained by the installation safety office and using organization. Section 14D—ESP Requirements 14.17.  ESPs for Non-DoD Explosives Activities on Air Force Installations. 14.17.1.  ESPs  for  non-DoD  explosives  activities  on  Air  Force  installations  will  include  a risk  assessment  for  all  exposed  government  personnel,  equipment,  and  assets  (within  or outside  the  explosives  clear  zone)  and  documented  risk  acceptance  by  the  responsible Commander.  (T-1).  The  responsible  Commander  must  consider  the  possible  impact  to current and future DoD mission requirements in the event of a mishap. (T-1).  Non-DoD user insurance  coverage  for  government  equipment  and  assets  will  not,  by  itself,  be  adequate justification for exposure to unacceptable risk. 14.17.2.  ESPs  for  non-DoD  explosives  activities  on  Air  Force  installations  will  either  be prepared IAW the requirements of this section, or will be “foot print” only ESPs. (T-1).  Foot print  ESPs  contain  only  the  information  necessary  to  determine  the  explosives  clear  zone (i.e., do not include building design, LPS, etc., unless it is used to determine the explosives clear zone). 14.17.3.  ESP  approval  alone  does  not  authorize  the  conduct  of  non-DoD  explosives activities on Air Force installations (see paragraph 12.86.). 14.17.4.  See  paragraph  12.86.  for  QD  criteria  for  non-DoD  explosives  activities  on  Air Force installations, and paragraph 1.9. for guidance on exceptions to this Manual. 14.18.  Siting a Non-Explosives Exposed Site.  For new construction, modification, or change in use of non-explosives facilities within an explosives clear zone it is acceptable to submit an ESP for the non-explosives facilities.  Comply with all applicable requirements of this section and include QD evaluations for all PESs within the evaluation zone.  See paragraph 14.24.7., Table 14.1. and Figure 14.1. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 357 14.19.  ESPs Involving Exceptions.  Include the information required per Section 1B for ESPs involving exceptions. 14.20.  Tiered  ESPs.  Tiered  ESPs  are  useful  when  the  NEWQD  of  a  PES  varies  because  of operational requirements.  It may also be useful when it is not practical on a daily basis to meet the required QD separation from a PES to all ESs for the largest possible NEWQD.  Under the tiered  ESP  concept,  the  responsible  Commander  takes  management  actions  (e.g.,  removal  of personnel  or  equipment,  re-designation  of  exposed  sites)  before  introducing  explosives  or increasing the NEWQD of a PES. (T-1). 14.20.1.  To prepare tiered ESPs, determine the NEWQD required for each type of activity at the PES and the QD separation required to each ES for each NEWQD.  In instances where the  required  QD  separation  cannot  be  met  at  a  given  NEWQD,  determine  if  management actions  may  be  taken  to  meet  the  required  QD  separation.    If  the  required  QD  separation cannot be met even with management actions, process a waiver or exemption IAW Section 1B. 14.20.2.  Prepare a management plan to document management actions required for each tier of  the  ESP.    Implement  this  management  plan  as  a  base  operations  plan,  operating instruction, agreement, supplement or other appropriate publication.  The management plan must specify: (T-1). 14.20.2.1.  Description of each management action required. 14.20.2.2.  Conditions  where  each  management  action  is  directed  and  when  the  action takes place. 14.20.2.3.  The organization responsible for implementing each management action. 14.20.2.4.  Requirement for periodic review of the management plan to ensure continued viability of the planned management actions. 14.20.3.  Tiered ESPs will: (T-1). 14.20.3.1.  Include an AF Form 943, Explosives Site Plan, or Explosives Safety Submittal Form for each tier, and assign a separate ESP action number to each tier. 14.20.3.2.  Reference  the  document  implementing  the  management  plan  required  in paragraph 14.20.2.  It is not necessary to include a copy of this document. 14.21.  Components of the ESP.  ESPs must include all the information needed for the reviewer to determine if the explosives safety requirements of this Manual are being met. (T-1).  Although the exact contents of an ESP may vary depending on the activity sited, ESPs generally include a transmittal  letter,  an  AF  Form  943,  or  ESS  Submittal  Form,  a  site  location  map,  and  various attachments.  For some ESPs, a transmittal letter containing pertinent information and a map may be  all  that  is  necessary.    Other  ESPs  may  require  documentation  such  as  detailed  drawings, engineering  analyses,  risk  assessments,  Commanders’  risk  acceptances,  etc,  in  order  to  verify compliance with explosives safety requirements (See paragraph 14.26.). 14.22.  Transmittal Letter. 14.22.1.  The  transmittal  letter  is  important  for  getting  an  ESP  successfully  reviewed  and approved.  Generally, explain all aspects of the siting and attempt to answer any questions before raised.  Consider that personnel reviewing the ESP may not be familiar with the base 358 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 or  operation,  including  unique  terminology,  and  do  not  know  the  mission  or  specific circumstances.  If the AF Form 943 or ESS Submittal Form contains a modification to the generated  ESP,  explain  the  change  in  the  transmittal  letter.    A  sample  transmittal  letter  is provided in Attachment 2. 14.22.2.  Include the ESP action number in the subject line of the memorandum.  ESP action numbers are developed as follows: 14.22.2.1.  The  requesting  MAJCOM  designation  followed  by  the  tenant  MAJCOM designation, if appropriate (e.g., USAFE-AFAFRICA, or AFMC-ACC). 14.22.2.2.  The installation where the PES is located (e.g., Hill, Ramstein, or Logan). 14.22.2.3.  Calendar year designation (e.g., 14, or 15). 14.22.2.4.  An (S) identifier followed by a sequence number (e.g., S26, or S39).  Number each request sequentially for each calendar year (e.g., the first ESP for the calendar year would be S1).  Canceled requests will not affect the number of subsequent requests (e.g., if USAFE-Ramstein-14-S10 were canceled, the next ESP submitted for Ramstein AB in 2014 would be S11. 14.22.2.5.  If  the  ESP  involves  QD  exceptions,  include  the  statement,  “WITH EXCEPTIONS”  immediately  following  the  ESP  action  number.    Example:    ACC-Barksdale-14-S33,  WITH  EXCEPTIONS.    If  the  ESP  involves  only  compensatory measures “WITH COMPENSATORY  MEASURES”  immediately  following  the  ESP  action  number.    In addition, units will develop a means to assure continued implementation of compensatory measures per MAJCOM direction. 14.22.2.6.  If  the  transmittal  letter  is  for  more  than  one  ESP,  include  the  ESP  action number for each ESP (e.g., PACAF-Hickam-14-S5, S6, and S10, or AMC-Scott-15-S20 through S34). exceptions, statement, include the that avoid all  QD 14.22.3.  Begin the letter by explaining the purpose of the submission (e.g., Request routine processing for subject site plan for final approval).  If new construction is involved, include this statement in the subject line:  “Involving new Construction.”  This ensures reviewing and approval authorities correctly prioritize the submission request for review. 14.22.4.  State  the  reason(s)  for  the  request  (e.g.,  “to  construct  a  new  maintenance  and inspection  facility,”  or  “to  increase  the  NEWQD  at  an  existing  aboveground  magazine”).  Clearly  identify  whether  new  construction  is  requested;  expeditious  and  new  construction ESPs receive priority processing. 14.22.5.  If  the  ESP  replaces  an  existing  ESP  include  a  cancellation  statement  (e.g.,  “The modification to this facility cancels ESP AFMC-Hill-02-S7”). 14.22.6.  State whether or not all explosives safety criteria are met.  If there are waivers or exemptions,  provide  a  unique  exception  identification  tracking  number  for  each  waiver  or exemption.    This  number  is  developed  using  the  format  as  described  in  paragraphs 14.22.2.1. through  14.22.2.5., with the following modifications: AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 359 14.22.6.1.  Use the identifier (W) for waivers or (E) for exemptions instead of (S) for the identification tracking number in Column 10 of the AF Form 943 or include in the Notes section on the ESS Submittal Form for the applicable exposure. 14.22.6.2.  This unique identification number is based on the approval level, installation, and calendar year.  Each installation uses its own numbering sequence (e.g., ACC-Hill-15-W01)  as  the  first  MAJCOM-level  waiver  identification  number  at  Hill  AFB  for calendar  year  2015.   Use  388FW-Hill-15-W01  for  the  first  wing-level  waiver identification number. 14.22.6.3.  Subsequent  ESP  submissions  with  QD  exceptions  within  the  same  calendar year  use  the  next  available  identification  number  at  that  installation  for  the  type  of exception  required  (e.g.,  the  next MAJCOM-level  waiver  identification  number  at  Hill AFB would be ACC-Hill-15-W02 while the first MAJCOM-level exemption would use ACC-Hill-15-E01).    This  method  allows  accurate  tracking  of  exceptions  based  on  the approval level, installation and calendar year. 14.22.6.4.  Include superseded waiver or exemption identification numbers, if applicable. 14.22.7.  If the ESP has  any unique characteristics, explain what criteria are being  applied and the basis for the application. 14.22.8.  Describe compensatory measures if they are necessary to meet QD standards.  The responsible  Commander  must  sign  ESPs  containing  compensatory  measures.  (T-1).    Units will  develop  a  means  to  assure  continued  implementation  of  compensatory  measures  per MAJCOM direction. (T-1). 14.22.9.  For  ESPs  involving  new  construction,  include  the  project  identification  and Programming, Design, and Construction (PDC) number. 14.22.10.  Discuss any future plans that may impact this siting.  State that the Base Facilities Board has reconciled this particular ESP with the base comprehensive plan.  Provide meeting minutes, dated reference or written record of reconciliation. 14.22.11.  Explain the  format  being  used  to  record  QD  evaluation  (e.g.,  “The  attached  AF Form 943 and map show all exposures and required separations”). 14.22.12.  Provide  a  narrative  description  of  the  relevant  explosives  safety  aspects  of  the facility design. 14.22.12.1.  If the facility includes an LPS, state that it meets all design requirements of this Manual, NFPA 780, AFI 32-1065, and attach LPS drawings.  For PESs, if the facility does  not  include  an  LPS,  state  what  exception  is  being  applied  per  paragraph  5.25., address  any  requirements  relevant  to  that  exception,  and  attach  the  Commander’s  risk acceptance if required. 14.22.12.2.  If  protective  construction  features  not  previously  approved  by  the  DDESB are to be used (e.g., personnel shields, blast-resistant construction), include a structural engineering  analysis  and  construction  drawings  (see  paragraph  14.25.3.).    Provide  a summary of the results of the structural engineering analysis. 14.22.12.3.  Describe  how  compliance  with  the  glass  panel  design  requirements  of Section 5B is met.  Attach a glass breakage risk assessment if required. 360 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 14.22.12.4.  Describe results of WSM HERO assessment/EMR survey. 14.22.12.5.  Describe unique safety aspects of the facility design such as the presence of hazardous locations, use of conductive floors, etc. 14.22.12.6.  If  the  facility  design  is  a  standard  design  that  the  DDESB  has  previously reviewed  and  declared  acceptable,  construction  drawings  do  not  need  to  be  submitted.  Identify the drawing number and the source of previous DDESB approval (e.g., DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction).  HASs may be referred to by type (e.g., 3rd GEN, Korean TAB VEE).  Contact MAJCOM/SEW if definitive drawing numbers are unknown.    Describe  any  planned  deviations  from  the  standard  design  for  purposes  of local site adaptation (e.g., addition of gunite cover to an ECM to protect from erosion); do not make changes to standard designs that affect the explosives safety characteristics of the facility. 14.22.13.  For tiered ESPs, identify the management plan implementation document. 14.22.14.  Describe the evaluation zone used.  State if the evaluation zone does not exceed the IB distance, or if there are no PESs in the evaluation zone. 14.22.15.  State if a Commanders authorized risk acceptance option is being applied and the derivative paragraph/table/note option allowing the Commanders risk acceptance. 14.22.16.  Identify and explain the purpose of all attachments. 14.22.17.  Address  compliance  with  ESP  coordination  requirements  (e.g.,  notification  or coordination with host-nation officials, discussions with tenant units, etc.). 14.22.18.  Staff agency point of contact in the event clarification is necessary. 14.22.19.  If expeditious processing is being requested, include the following: the  reasons  why  expeditious  processing 14.22.19.1.  On the subject line of the memorandum state:  “Request for EXPEDITIOUS processing of Explosives Site Plan (ESP) for AFSPC-Vandenberg-14-S2.” 14.22.19.2.  Explain is  necessary  (e.g., compelling mission or construction impact).  These reasons must show sufficient mission impact to warrant the expeditious processing, or the ESP will be reviewed according to the routine processing procedures. 14.22.19.3.  Date  when  approval  is  needed  and  why  it  is  needed  by  that  date  (e.g., “Approval  is  required  by  15  June  2014  to  support  planned  contract  award  for  new construction”). 14.23.  ESP  Submittal  Form.  Use  the  ESP  submittal  form  (AF  Form  943  or  ESS  Submittal Form) to provide PES and ES information and to validate required QD separation.  Prepare a separate  Submittal  Form  for  each  PES  (or  ES  in  the  case  of  an  ES  ESP)  to  be  sited.    See paragraph 14.27. for alternative Submittal Form formats.  Instructions for completing AF Form 943 and the ESS Submittal Form are provided in Tables 14.2. and  14.3. respectively.  Include the following information on the ESP Submittal Form: 14.23.1.  ESP action number (see paragraph 14.22.2.). 14.23.2.  Location of the PES or ES being sited.  If the location is not a military installation, list civilian or commercial address. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 361 14.23.3.  For explosives locations, identify all ESs and PESs within the IB distance, and all PESs within the evaluation zone (EZ) if it is larger than the IB distance.  For ESPs with an IB distance  less  than  100  ft,  ensure  exposures  requiring  a  minimum  separation  distance  (e.g., 100 ft for parking areas exclusively supporting the PES) are identified.  For non-explosive locations, identify all PESs within the EZ.  For some non-explosive locations, it may not be necessary  to  identify  all  PESs  (e.g.,  unmanned  miscellaneous  structures  requiring  50  foot separation from any PES can be sited by merely identifying the nearest PES). 14.23.4.  The EZ is based on the QD type of the ES (e.g., Operating Location, CAPA), and the largest  NEWQD PES on the installation.  To determine the size of  the EZ, when a K Factor  is  required  use  the  largest  HD  1.1  NEWQD  authorized  in  a  single  PES  on  the installation or within the established clear zone (maximum of 500,000 pounds) (see Table 14.1.).  For other HDs, use the minimum prescribed distances found in the appropriate QD tables.  See Figure 14.1. for examples of EZs. 14.23.5.  For all PESs and ESs, provide the following: 14.23.5.1.  Assigned CE building number or other identifier (e.g., Bldg 123, or F123). 14.23.5.2.  Applicable Table 12. (X) description (e.g., ECM, or Related Facility.  Identify the presence of barricades if they affect the QD required). 14.23.5.3.  Primary  operation  normally  expected  at  the  facility  (e.g.,  shipping  and receiving, maintenance and inspection, or bomb build-up).  If facility type determines QD criteria applied, include definition of building such as Korean TAB VEE, 3rd Gen HAS, 26x60 igloo, 26x40 igloo, etc.  Show definitive drawing numbers when available. 14.23.5.4.  The organization whose assets or people will be in the facility.  Include the MAJCOM,  Wing,  Squadron,  and  show  unit  designations  by  number  and  alpha designation  (e.g.,  USAFE-52FW).    Include  the  branch  of  service  if  other  than  the  Air Force. 14.23.5.5.  Optional for ESS Submittal Form.  Total number of people (M for Military or DoD Civilian, C for Non-DoD Civilian, DC for Defense Contractors, and FN for Foreign Nationals) normally assigned  to the location.  Consider the number of persons present during exercises.  Do not include casuals such as inspectors or quality control evaluators.  Include a breakdown by room or bay, when appropriate.  Do not show people assigned to explosives storage locations, AECPAs, or CAPAs. 14.23.6.  For  all  PES,  provide  the  NEWQD  for  all  HDs  (HD  1.2.3,  1.5  and  1.6  may  be omitted unless quantities will be present).  Include MCE for HD 1.2.1.  Include LSRN and parenthetical fragment distance for HD 1.2.3.  If no LSRN is specified, use the NEWQD of the  single  round.    If  no  NEWQD  is  provided,  contact  AFSEC/SEW.    For  HD  1.4  show “Capacity” or “Op Limit.”  If no explosives in a particular HD will be present, type “None.”  For multiple room facilities, show values for each room where explosives will be present.  Where IM is not provided between rooms or cubicles, show overall values for the facility.  If explosives are unpackaged see Section 3C.  The explosive authorization must always show the sited, waived, or exempted weights, whichever is greater. 14.23.7.  It  is  important  to  ensure  facilities  or  locations  being  sited,  whether  explosive  or non-explosive, within the IBD and EZ comply with QD requirements.  Accomplish this by 362 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 conducting a paired relationship evaluation.  Evaluate an explosives facility or location as both  a  PES  and  an  ES.    This  is  a  two-way  evaluation  where  the  most  restrictive  distance between  the  pair  is  documented.    A  non-explosive  ES  is  a  one-way  evaluation  from surrounding PESs to the ES. 14.23.8.  Identify the actual separation between each pair. 14.23.9.  Using  applicable  Chapter  12  table  and  applicable  Notes,  identify  the  most restrictive  (greatest)  separation  distance  required  between  each  pair  for  each  HD,  and  the appropriate K-factor, minimum distance or rule used to determine this distance. 14.23.10.  For  each  instance  where  the  required  separation  is  greater  than  the  actual separation, provide the exception identification number (see paragraph 14.22.6.). 14.23.11.  For ESPs with waivers or exemptions, include the following: 14.23.11.1.  Indicate  the  effect  an  MCE  at  the  PES  has  on  the  unit  mission,  or  other supported agencies (see Chapter 2). 14.23.11.2.  Describe  any  corrective  actions,  compensatory  measures,  and  controls  to achieve safety during operations if the ESP is approved.  State whether corrective action can  or  cannot  be  done  locally  with  available  funds  or  other  resources.    If  there  is  no planned  construction  or  other  corrective  actions,  explain  why.    Show  planned  or programmed (funded and unfunded) actions to eliminate exceptions.  Such action might include recommendations to higher headquarters, assigning priorities, funding revisions to standard facilities, etc.  If there are other local projects underway that involve funding, show  the  following:    construction  priority  assigned,  Military  Construction  Program (MCP) item number, and fiscal year for construction.  Include any operational controls necessary. 14.23.11.3.  Give the reason for the request.  Describe impact if requested action is not approved. 14.23.12.  If  exceptions  are  involved,  or  if  compensatory  measures  are  used  to  prevent  an exception, include approvals from the appropriate agencies and the responsible Commander.  For exceptions, the responsible Commander's signature shows that the request is needed for the mission and that the risks are acceptable for strategic or compelling operational reasons.  For  compensatory  measures,  the  responsible  Commander’s  signature  shows  that  the compensatory measures are acceptable and will be enforced. 14.24.  Site Location Map.  A sample site location map is provided in Figures 14.2. and  14.3. 14.24.1.  Submit a map clearly showing all the PESs and ESs relevant to the ESP. 14.24.2.  Use  a  1”=  400’  (or  similar  metric)  scale.    To  enhance  clarity  or  show  precise measurements,  use  a  larger  (1”=200’  or  100’)  scaled  map.    To  properly  reflect  certain distance  and  structure  relationships  within  the  area  surrounding  the  project,  use  a  smaller scaled map.  Provide the scale on the map.  Express all distances in feet, if feasible.  An ESP generated map is acceptable. 14.24.3.  Details  such  as  the  specific  points  of  measurement,  actual  and  required  distance, and NEWQDs are encouraged. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 363 14.24.4.  When there is reasonable doubt about the accuracy of the mapped location, it is the responsibility  of  all  participants  in  the  explosives  site  planning  process  to  define  a  locally acceptable method for determining the measurement accuracy required between the PES-ES locations. 14.24.5.  If  the  base  boundary  is  not  shown  on  the  map,  certify  the  relationship  of  the explosives clear zone to the base boundary in the transmittal letter. 14.24.6.  When siting a PES, show all exposed sites within IBD of the PES.  When there is an evaluation zone larger than the IB clear zone of the PES being sited show the evaluation zone (with dashed line) and the PESs in it. 14.24.7.  When  siting  an  ES,  show  the  evaluation  zone  (dashed  line)  and  all  PESs  in  the evaluation zone. 14.24.8.  Use color coding to simplify and speed the review process.  Identify the PESs in red and ESs in green.  Highlight the clear zone lines in red. 14.24.9.  Include ESP action number, title and scale. 14.24.10.  Show  topographic  contours  or  features,  such  as  natural  barricades  (i.e.,  dense forest or hills) if they are pertinent to the application of QD. 14.24.11.  When  siting  multiple  PESs,  show  the  IBD  clear  zone  for  each  PES.    Show  a blended clear zone if it provides additional clarity. 14.25.  Construction Drawings and Structural Engineering Analyses. 14.25.1.  For facilities not being constructed IAW a previously DDESB-approved design (see paragraph  14.22.12.2.),  construction  drawings  showing  applicable  safety  and  protective features are required.  These drawings must show, as a minimum, the following information: (T-1). 14.25.1.1.  Floor layout, roofs, windows, and general materials used. 14.25.1.2.  Substantial  dividing  walls,  vent  walls,  firewalls,  operational  shields  and barricades. 14.25.1.3.  Exits and fire protection system installations. 14.25.1.4.  Types  of  floor  finish,  electrical  systems  and  equipment,  and  ventilation systems and equipment. 14.25.1.5.  Hazardous waste disposal systems. 14.25.1.6.  LPS and static grounding systems.  See paragraph 14.25.2. for detailed LPS drawing requirements. 14.25.1.7.  Process equipment. 14.25.1.8.  Auxiliary support structures. 14.25.1.9.  Drawings,  specifications,  rationale  and  base  security  manager  approval  of physical security designs when the design is different than standard construction methods used for explosive facilities. 364 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 14.25.1.10.  Do  not  submit  drawings  (e.g.,  for  landscapes  or  pavements)  that  are  not relevant to QD or safety protective factors. 14.25.2.  LPS drawings must include: (T-1). 14.25.2.1.  Elements of the LPS, such as air terminals, masts, overhead wires, grounding electrode system and a description of the surge protection. 14.25.2.2.  Top, front, side, and additional views as necessary depicting the dimensions (spacing and height) between design elements.   Front and side elevations depicting air terminals and the 100-foot radius (200 feet diameter) rolling sphere zone of protection is suggested to facilitate the ESP review process. 14.25.3.  For  protective  construction  features  not  previously  approved  by  the  DDESB, provide construction drawings and a structural engineering analysis including: 14.25.3.1.  Statement  of  the  design  objectives  in  terms  of  protection  categories  to  be obtained (see DDESB TP 15, Approved Protective Construction). 14.25.3.2.  The explosives quantities involved. 14.25.3.3.  The design loads applied. 14.25.3.4.  Any material properties and structural behavior assumptions made. 14.25.3.5.  References and the sources of methods used. 14.25.3.6.  Qualifications  of  the  Preparer.    Only  engineers  who  are  experienced  in  the field of structural dynamics and who use design procedures accepted by professionals, in that field, may design explosion resistant facilities. 14.26.  Automated Explosives Safety Siting.  Automated explosives safety siting programs are the  preferred  method  of  ESP  development.    To  the  greatest  extent  possible,  use  automated explosives safety siting for ESP development.  In the event automated explosives safety siting program is not available for the location requiring an ESP submission, use manual means of ESP development but submit it electronically to the greatest extent possible. 14.27.  Alternative  Submittal  Form  Formats.  In  some  instances,  modifications  to  the  AF Form 943, ESS Submittal Form, or a substitute format may be acceptable.  Provide a description of the proposed alternative format, and justification for its use, to the MAJCOM for approval.  MAJCOM/SE  will  coordinate  with  AFSEC/SEW  prior  to  granting  approval.  (T-1).    Any alternative format used must provide the information required in paragraph 14.23. (T-1). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 365 Figure 14.1.

Base evaluation zones shown on 500,000 pounds NEWQD at the applicable K factor for the paired relationship.  Use smaller evaluation zones based on the largest amount of HD 1.1 authorized in a single PES on the installation or within the established clear zone.  For other HDs, use the prescribed distances found in the appropriate QD tables. 2.  Evaluation zones that are smaller than the IB clear zone of the PES being sited have no effect because all the facilities within that IB zone are already listed. 3.  Related facilities being evaluated may not be related to the PES where the EZ was determined.  In addition to the PESs in the evaluation zone, list those PESs that have an IB relationship to the ES.  4.  Use evaluation zones for IB targets only to determine if an ESP is required.  Only prepare an ESP for ESs requiring IB distance from all PESs if they are located within an explosives clear zone. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 369 Table 14.2.

Identify the total number of people (M for Military or DoD Civilian, C for Non-DoD Civilian, DC for Defense Contractors, and FN for Foreign Nationals) normally assigned  to the location.  Consider the number of persons present during exercises.  Do not include casuals such as inspectors or quality control evaluators.  Include a breakdown by room or bay, when appropriate.  Do not show people assigned to explosives storage locations, AECPAs, or CAPAs. 12.  Columns 5 through 6: 13.  For a PES, provide the NEWQD for all HDs (HD 1.2.3, 1.5 and 1.6 may be omitted unless quantities will be present).  Include MCE for HD 1.2.1 in Column 6.  Include LSRN and parenthetical fragment distance for HD 1.2.3 in Column 6.  For HD 1.4 show “Capacity” or “MEQ” in Column 5.  If no explosives in a particular HD will be present, type “None” in Column 5.  For multiple room facilities, show values for each room where explosives will be present.  Where IM is not provided between rooms or cubicles show the overall value for the facility.  If explosives are unpackaged see Section 3C.  The explosive authorization must always show the sited, waived, or exempted weights, whichever is greater. 14.  For an ES, type “None” in Column 5 for each HD.   15.  Section III – PES/ES Q-D Paired Relationships With Facility/Location Being Sited 16.  Columns 1 through 6: 17.  Provide the same data as described for Columns 1 through 6 in Section II. 18.  For PES ESPs, identify all ESs and PESs within the IB distance, and all PESs within the evaluation zone (EZ) if it is larger than the IB distance. 19.  For ES ESPs, identify all PESs within the EZ.  For some ES ESPs, it may not be necessary to identify all PESs (e.g., unmanned miscellaneous structures requiring 50 foot separation from any PES can be sited by merely identifying the nearest PES). 20.  If exceptions are involved, provide the exception identification number per paragraph 14.22.6. in Column 10, Remarks. 21.  Column 7.  Identify the actual separation between facilities listed in Column 2, Sections II and III. 22.  Column 8.  Identify the most restrictive (greatest) separation distance required between the facility listed in column 2, Sections II and III.  If both facilities are PESs, perform a two-way AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 371 evaluation between the pair and document the most restrictive distance.  For exposures requiring only 50’ minimum or no QD separation distance, use a one-line entry. 23.  Column 9.  Identify the applicable Chapter 12 Table column/line and applicable Notes to obtain the distance in Column 8.  If there is a specific facility or situation that is not listed in the applicable Chapter 12 Table, use Section 12O. Table 14.3.  Sample Explosives Safety Site Plan Submittal Form.  Notes:   1.  The following sections describe the information provided in a submittal form created using the Automated Explosives Safety Siting program.  If siting without the use of an Automated Explosives Safety Siting program, refer to Table 14.2. and use the AF Form 943.   2.  Section I – General Information: 3.  Installation:  Used to record the installation ID.   4.  Location:  Provides the location of the PES or ES being sited and must include the ESP ID number. 5.  Date:  Used to record the date the ESP was created. 6.  QD Engine/Automated Explosives Safety Siting Program Version:  Documents the QD engine/version number, as well as, the Automated Explosives Safety Siting Program build/version number used to create the ESP. 7.  Section II – Data on Facility Being Sited.   8.  Column 1:  Provides the assigned CE building number or other identifier as well as the owning command and/or unit.   372 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 9.  Column 2:  Documents the assigned type code and facility description (e.g., EOL, Explosives Operating Facility). 10.  Column 3:  Identifies the largest required IBD.

Columns 5 through 10:  Documents the HD NEWQDs, (xx), and MCEs for the facility being sited.  If the facility being sited is a non-explosives ES, 0’ will be listed in all HD columns. 13.  Section III – PES/ES QD Paired Relationships with Facility Being Sited.   14.  If the ES is a non-explosives location, it will have a single line entry unless it falls within multiple sectors of a segmented clear zone.  In this case, it will have a single line enter for each sector.  If the ES is also a PES, and within the established IBD zone, it will have a two line entry; one as an ES and one as a PES (reverse).  If the ES is a PES beyond IBD but within the EZ, it will have a single line entry (reverse). 15.  Columns 1 and 2:  Provides the same data described for Columns 1 and 2 in Section II above.   16.  Column 3:  Used to record the Actual Distance and Required Distance for the paired relationship.  The required distance corresponds to the largest required distance found in columns 5 through 10.   17.  Column 4:  This column is used to describe the orientation of the ES from the PES being sited as well as the orientation of the ES to the PES (reverse) when the ES is also a PES.  The Automated Explosives Safety Siting program-related code is also provided when applicable. 18.  Columns 5 through 10:   19.  For a non-explosives ES, a single line entry will be used unless the ES falls in multiple sectors of a segmented zone.  In this case, a single line entry will be used for each sector. Each column will list the required distance, AFMAN reference, and exposure type (IM, ILD, PTRD, etc.).  If exceptions are involved, the information for the HD causing the violation will be in red.  Ensure “Submittal Notes” reference the exception number assigned to the violation.   20.  For an ES that’s also a PES, use a multiple line entry.  One for the ES as an ES from the PES being sited and one for the ES as a PES to the PES being sited.  As a PES, columns will also document the NEWQD, MCE, and (xx) of the ES when applicable.   21.  If the ES is also a PES beyond IBD but within the EZ, use a single line entry to show reverse siting requirements as a PES.   22.  Section IV – Exposures Not Requiring QD.   23.  Use this section to identify ESs not requiring QD.  Typically, these facilities will have a type code of NAF (non-applicable facility).  Include information in the Notes column explaining why QD does not apply. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 373 Chapter 15 REAL PROPERTY KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO CONTAIN MUNITIONS AND EXPLOSIVES OF CONCERN AND CHEMICAL AGENTS Section 15A—Introduction 15.1.  General.  Use  every  means  possible  to  protect  the  general  public  and  the  environment from exposure to AE hazards.  This includes all explosive hazard areas, suspected or known to exist, on real property currently or formerly under USAF ownership or control. 15.1.1.  This  Chapter  establishes  explosives  safety  standards  that,  when  applied,  protects people and real property from explosive and Chemical Agent (CA) hazards associated with real property known or suspected to contain: 15.1.1.1.  Munitions and explosives of concern (MEC). 15.1.1.2.  CA  in  other  than  munitions  configurations  (e.g.,  DoD  laboratory  vials,  CA identification sets, one-ton containers, CA-contaminated soil). 15.1.2.  This  Chapter  establishes  a  process  for  determining  site-specific  actions  that,  when taken: 15.1.2.1.  Ensure explosives safety is addressed throughout munitions responses to MEC. 15.1.2.2.  Ensure  Chemical  Warfare  Material  (CWM)  safety  and,  when  applicable, explosives safety is addressed throughout CWM responses (i.e. a response to CA-filled munitions). 15.1.2.3.  Result  in  DDESB  approval  of  required  safety  submissions  for  munitions responses  to  MEC  and  for  CWM  responses  (See  Section  15E  for  required  safety submission and their contents). 15.1.2.4.  Document and report completion of MEC and CWM responses. 15.1.3.  This Chapter does not apply to: 15.1.3.1.  Operational ranges, with the exception of military munitions burial sites located on such ranges. 15.1.3.2.  Explosives or munitions emergency responses. Section 15B—Explosives Safety Standards for the Identification and Control of Areas Known or Suspected to Contain MEC or CA 15.2.  Identification  and  Control.  To  ensure  explosives  and  CA  safety  risk  is  identified  and controlled on real property currently or formerly under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the USAF, installations must: (T-1).  15.2.1.  Identify  all  areas  known  or  suspected  to  present  explosive  or  CA  hazards (Geographic Information Systems must be used): 374 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 15.2.1.1.  In installation master plans for active installations (In some cases, these areas are also required to be identified in other documents). 15.2.1.2.  In DoD’s military Munitions Response Site  Inventory for those sites that are included in the Military Munitions Response Program (see Management Guidance for the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP) and 10 U.S.C. 2710(a). 15.2.2.  Maintain permanent records of those areas identified pursuant to paragraph 15.2.1. and  ensure  such  records  are  readily  available  to  current  and  futures  users  of  the  property.  Retain  records  for  areas  such  as  operational  ranges,  former  ranges,  current  or  former munitions  manufacturing for  munitions demilitarization activities, and locations previously used for the burial of munitions.  Records must: (T-1). facilities,  current  or former  sites  used 15.2.2.1.  When  practicable,  include  the  nomenclature  and  the  known  or  suspected location. 15.2.2.2.  Summarize  any  clearance  or  response  (removal  or  remediation)  actions,  or explosives or munitions emergency responses previously conducted within the area. 15.2.3.  Prohibit unnecessary access and take appropriate action to deter unauthorized access to areas under DoD control that are known or suspected of containing potential explosive or CA hazards. 15.2.3.1.  Such actions may include  establishing access  controls (e.g., fencing the  area, establishing  roving  security  patrols),  which  may  be  risk-based,  or  providing  public notifications  of  any  potential  hazards  (e.g.,  posting  UXO-hazard  warning  signs, conducting UXO-safety education programs). 15.2.3.1.1.  When  used,  signs  must  be  kept  legible  and,  when  appropriate,  in  the predominant languages of the region, or as pictograms. (T-1). 15.2.3.1.2.  When the DoD does not exercise jurisdiction, custody, or control over the area (e.g., Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS)), the responsible installation must, at a minimum, provide written notification of the potential explosive or CA hazards to the property owner and any known tenants. (T-1). 15.2.3.1.3.  Maintain  a  record  of  this  notification  as  a  permanent  record  (see paragraph 15.2.2.). 15.2.3.2.  Installations  must,  unless  there  is  evidence  to  the  contrary,  assume  the following areas present explosive hazards: 15.2.3.2.1.  Impact areas on operational ranges.  Exceptions are ranges known to have been exclusively used for training with only small arms ammunition. 15.2.3.2.2.  Former ranges known or suspected to contain MEC. 15.2.3.2.3.  Outdoor  demolition  areas,  to  include  locations  used  for  open  burning (OB) or open detonation (OD). that  are  associated  with  military  munitions  production, 15.2.3.2.4.  Areas demilitarization,  renovation,  or  similar  processes  (e.g.,  operating  buildings  and  any installed  equipment)  that  generated  explosives  residues  (e.g.,  dust,  vapors,  liquids) AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 375 and  that  might  have  become  contaminated  with  such  residues  in  concentrations sufficient  to  present  explosive  hazards,  to  include  areas  receiving  processing wastewater (e.g., settling ponds, drainage swales). 15.2.3.3.  Installations  should,  unless  there  is  evidence  to  the  contrary,  assume  the following areas present CA hazards: 15.2.3.3.1.  Former CWM or CA burial sites. 15.2.3.3.2.  Former CWM or CA disposal areas. 15.2.3.3.3.  Former CWM impact areas. 15.2.3.3.4.  Former training areas used for training with CWM or CA. 15.2.3.3.5.  Former CWM or CA production and demilitarization facilities. 15.2.3.4.  When access to areas known or suspected to present explosive or CA hazards is necessary,  a  risk  assessment  to  evaluate  the  potential  hazards  associated  with  the proposed  activity  must  be  completed  and  methods  to  mitigate  any  potential  exposures implemented before access is allowed. (T-1). 15.2.3.5.  When access is necessary to real property not under DoD ownership, custody, or control, installations should obtain a right of entry for the property. (T-1). 15.2.4.  Prohibit  the  disposal  (e.g.,  burying,  dumping)  of  military  munitions  on  land  or  in water except when specifically authorized by the appropriate MAJCOM in coordination with AFSEC/SEW.  (T-1).    Such  disposal  actions  must  comply  with  applicable  regulatory requirements. (T-0).  This prohibition does not preclude: 15.2.4.1.  The  covering  of  munitions  with  earth  to  control  fragments  and  noise  during authorized destruction by detonation. 15.2.4.2.  The use of in situ capping when implemented as an engineered remedy under an authorized response action. Section 15C—Safety Aspects of Explosives and CA Response Actions 15.3.  Response Actions. 15.3.1.  Plans for munitions responses to MEC or CWM responses must: (T-0). 15.3.1.1.  Ensure  close  coordination,  as  applicable,  between  DoD  explosives  and  CA safety  organizations,  DoD  environmental  organizations,  and  appropriate  regulatory agencies and stakeholders. 15.3.1.2.  Specify those actions necessary to protect DoD personnel, installation-related personnel, and the public from exposure to explosive and CA hazards. 15.3.1.3.  Provide  the  design  for  and  explain  the  execution  of  a  munitions  and  CWM response,  when  MEC  and  CA,  respectively,  have  been  determined  to  present  an unacceptable risk. 15.3.1.4.  Explain  how  the  selected  response  actions  will  achieve  a  degree  of protectiveness necessary for the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated future land use. 376 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 15.3.1.4.1.  Provide  the  rationale  for  selection  of  technologies  to  be  used  to  detect anomalies  that  can  indicate  the  presence  of  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA configuration. 15.3.1.4.2.  Address how periodically (e.g., during 5-year reviews or consistent with long-term  monitoring  agreements)  completed  response  actions  will  be  reviewed  to ensure  the  response  remains  effective.    The  need  for  such  reviews  is  particularly important in areas where natural phenomena (e.g., frost heave, soil erosion, droughts, or tidal action) could expose MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, or where Land Use Controls (LUC) constitute a major element of the response.  These reviews must consider: (T-0). 15.3.1.4.2.1.  The explosives safety aspects of munitions responses to MEC. 15.3.1.4.2.2.  The CA safety and, when applicable, the explosives safety aspects of CWM responses. 15.3.1.5.  Address how the personnel qualification provisions of DDESB TP 18 will be met. (T-0). 15.3.1.6.  Be  approved  by  the  DDESB  for  compliance  with  DoD  explosives  safety standards. 15.3.1.7.  Provide for the submission of  an After Action Report (AAR)  to the DDESB upon completion of the response.  AAR are not provided for DDESB approval, but are used to close out files maintained by the DDESB Staff. 15.3.2.  Residual Explosive and CA Hazards. 15.3.2.1.  Some areas that the military has used for munitions-related activities (e.g., live-fire training or testing, OB/OD) or for CA-related activities may not be appropriate, even after  the  performance  of  response  activities,  for  certain  uses  (e.g.,  residential development).  Such areas include former military range impact areas where the military has used munitions containing either HE or CA and sites used for either OB or OD.  Such areas  may,  after  a  response,  be  better  suited  for  uses  that  restrict  or  limit  intrusive activities (e.g., wildlife refuges, surface recreational areas). 15.3.2.2.  Some MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, might not be detected or removed  during  a  response.    Although  residual  risks  can  be  managed  (e.g.,  by  use  of agreed-upon  LUC,  to  include  safety  education;  recurring  reviews;  and  construction support), residual hazards might still exist. 15.3.2.3.  From an explosives and, when applicable, CA safety perspective, the degree to which MEC or CA removal is undertaken depends largely on the current, determined, or reasonably  anticipated  future  land  use.    When  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA configuration,  cannot  be  removed  to  the  degree  necessary  to  safely  allow  the  current, determined,  or  reasonably  anticipated  future  land  use,  the  use  must  be  changed  or appropriately restricted to obtain DDESB approval of the relevant plan. (T-0). 15.3.2.4.  When DoD does not control the land and the imposition of LUC is not possible (e.g., on FUDS), the responsible installation must, at a minimum, provide the property owner, and any known tenants, written notification of the potential residual explosive or AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 377 CA  hazards  and  the  risks  inherent  in  any  use  of  property  that  is  consistent  with  those hazards. (T-1). 15.3.3.  Explosives Safety and CA Safety Aspects in the Selection and Design of Responses. 15.3.3.1.  Explosives safety must be addressed in the selection and design of a munitions response  to  MEC.  (T-1).    CA  safety,  and  when  applicable,  explosives  safety  must  be addressed in the selection and design of a CWM response. (T-1).  The protection afforded by a response must be consistent with the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated land use. (T-1).  The design of the response that is included in the required submission must consider the site-specific information below. (T-1). 15.3.3.1.1.  Historical  Information.  Historical  information,  documented  in  a  written report, is gathered through a records search, to include the permanent records outlined in paragraph 5.2., and interviews.  The following information is required: 15.3.3.1.1.1.  The boundaries of the response area.  For munitions responses, the Munitions  Response  Area  (MRA)  boundaries  and,  when  appropriate,  the boundaries  of  any  Munitions  Response  Sites  (MRS)  (e.g.,  firing  points,  impact areas, and burial sites) within the MRA are required. 15.3.3.1.1.2.  The  type  of  MEC  known  or  suspected  to  be  present  based  on  the types of munitions-related operations, training, or testing previously performed in the MRA or MRS. 15.3.3.1.1.3.  The  type  and  configuration  of  any  CA  known  or  suspected  to  be present. 15.3.3.1.2.  Land Use.  Land use is the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated future use of real property.  Because portions of the response area (e.g., the MRA or MRS) might be used differently (e.g., public highway, wildlife refuge, sports field, industrial  complex),  different  response  actions  (e.g.,  surface  removal,  subsurface removal,  no  removal,  remedial  response)  may  be  appropriate  within  any  given response area. 15.3.3.1.2.1.  Where the land use is limited to surface activities, the munitions or CWM response may only involve removing surface MEC or surface CA.  This removal may be technology-aided. 15.3.3.1.2.2.  When the land use will involve or allow intrusive activities to occur, the response will normally require a subsurface removal, and may require follow-on construction support. 15.3.3.1.2.3.  Where the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated land use is compatible  with  the  explosive  or  CA  hazards  present  or  suspected,  a  response action to remove any explosive or CA hazards may not be necessary. 15.3.3.1.2.4.  Where  a  response  would  adversely  impact  natural  or  cultural resources, a removal action may not be practical. 15.3.3.1.3.  Results  of  Onsite  Investigations.    Use  these  results  to  validate  and augment  information  discovered  during  the  historical  review  and  to  determine  the 378 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 specific  boundaries  of  the  response  area  (e.g.,  the  boundary  of  an  MRA  or  of  any MRS within an MRA). 15.3.3.1.4.  Analysis.  Conduct a detailed analysis of available records, technical data, and the results of onsite investigations.  This analysis must evaluate: 15.3.3.1.4.1.  The types of MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, known to be  present,  to  include  its  technical  characteristics  (e.g.,  filler,  fuzing)  and estimated distribution. 15.3.3.1.4.2.  The potential explosive or CA hazards present. 15.3.3.1.4.3.  Physical  site  characteristics  (e.g.,  flora  and  fauna,  endangered species, cultural items, geological, topographical, hydrological). 15.3.3.1.4.4.  People potentially endangered. 15.3.3.1.4.5.  Information from previous or current responses. 15.3.3.1.5.  LUC. Evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of LUCs to manage any residual explosives safety or CA safety risks. 15.3.3.1.6.  Technology.    Evaluate  the  applicability,  capabilities,  and  limitations  of available technologies (e.g., detection, discrimination, removal). 15.3.3.1.7.  Other relevant factors. Section 15D—Special Considerations 15.4.  Explosive Soil. 15.4.1.  Because of some past munitions-related activities (e.g., settling ponds or explosives sumps at munitions production or demilitarization facilities), concentrations of explosives in soil  (e.g.,  sand,  sludge,  clay)  can  exist  such  that  the  mixture  itself  presents  an  explosive hazard.  Such mixtures are referred to as “explosive soil.” 15.4.1.1.  The NEWQD of explosive soil is the weight of the mixture multiplied by the explosives concentration (e.g., 1,000 lbs [454 kg] of explosive soil that is 10 percent TNT has an NEWQD of 100 lbs [45.4 kg]). 15.4.1.2.  The  concentration  necessary  to  present  an  explosive  hazard  depends  on  the distribution and type of explosives in the soil and the soil’s characteristics. 15.4.2.  Primary (Initiating) Explosives. 15.4.2.1.  Soil  containing  two  percent  or  more  by  weight  of  any  primary  explosive  or mixture of primary explosives presents an explosive hazard and must be treated as HD 1.1. (T-0). 15.4.2.2.  Soil containing less than two percent by weight of any primary explosive does not present an explosive hazard. 15.4.3.  Secondary Explosives. 15.4.3.1.  Secondary explosives are much less sensitive than primary explosives. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 379 15.4.3.2.  Soil  containing  10  percent  or  more  of  weight  of  either  any  secondary explosives or a mixture of secondary explosives presents an explosive hazard and must be treated as HD 1.1.  (T-0). 15.4.3.3.  Soil containing less than 10 percent by weight of any secondary explosive or a mixture of secondary explosives does not present an explosive hazard. 15.4.4.  Nitroglycerin, Nitrocellulose, and Nitroguanidine. 15.4.4.1.  Soil containing 10 percent or more by weight of nitroglycerine, nitrocellulose, or nitroguanidine presents an explosive hazard and must be treated as HD 1.1. (T-0). 15.4.4.2.  Soil containing less than 10 percent by weight of nitroglycerin, nitrocellulose, or  nitroguanidine  does  not  present  an  explosive  hazard.    Care  must  be  taken  when applying  this  threshold  rule  to  less-permeable  soils,  such  as  clay,  that  may  cause nitroglycerin to pool, rather than be absorbed. 15.4.5.  Other Energetic Materials Mixtures.  The potential explosive hazard of such mixtures in  soil  may  be  unknown  and  may  require  testing.    If  the  hazard  is  unknown,  manage  soil mixtures  containing  only  propellants  as  secondary  explosives,  and  all  other  soil  mixtures containing energetics (e.g., liquid propellants) as primary explosives. 15.5.  Real Property-Buildings and Installed Equipment. 15.5.1.  Military  munitions  operating  buildings (e.g.,  munitions  production  or demilitarization facilities) and any installed equipment may contain residual explosives that present an explosive hazard. 15.5.2.  Of particular concern are building features (e.g., floors, roofs, walls, drains, internal and external piping, ventilation systems) where explosives residues could present explosive hazards and industrial equipment, particularly equipment with internal cavities from facilities used  in  munitions  production  or  demilitarization  operations  (e.g.,  cast  loading  or  milling, steam-out) that generated explosives residues (e.g., dust, vapors, liquids). 15.5.3.  To the extent buildings or installed equipment is believed to present an explosive or CA hazard, installations, in coordination with MAJCOM and AFSEC/SEW, must submit to the  DDESB  for  use  of  such  buildings  and  installed  equipment  before  use  or  transfer  for purpose  incompatible  with  the  presence  of  the  explosive  hazard  (see  DoD  6055.09-M, Volume 7, for additional information). (T-1). 15.6.  Construction Support. 15.6.1.  Responsible  installations  must  consider  the  level  of  construction  support  required, based on site-specific data, during activities below. (T-1). 15.6.1.1.  Intrusive  activities  (e.g.,  building  construction,  laying  utilities,  or  road improvements) on property known or suspected to contain MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, or on property where residual explosive or CA hazards may exist. 15.6.1.2.  The  removal  or  remediation  of  debris  or  media  in  areas  where  there  is  a probability of encountering MEC (e.g., former OB/OD grounds) or CA. 15.6.2.  The responsible authority (e.g., installation Commander or designated representative) will determine whether such support is required and the level of effort of required support on 380 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 a case-by-case basis (see paragraph 15.10.7.). (T-1).  Construction support is determined by the probability of encountering MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration as follows: 15.6.2.1.  Low Probability. “On-call” construction support is appropriate. 15.6.2.1.1.  A  “low”  determination  may  only  be  assigned  to  those  areas  where  a search  of  available  historical  records  and  onsite  investigation  data  indicates  that, given  the  military  or  munitions-related  activities  that  occurred  at  the  site,  the likelihood of encountering MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, is low. 15.6.2.1.2.  Munitions-related activities that may merit a “low” determination include, but are not limited to, the former use of the area for live-fire training exclusively with small  arms  ammunition;  for  maneuver  training,  to  include  maneuver  training involving  the  use  of  smokes,  pyrotechnics,  and  simulators;  as  firing  points;  for munitions  inspection,  handling,  storage,  or  transfers,  to  include  residue  points  and inert  storage  yards;  for  air  defense;  or  as  munitions  operating  facilities.    The exceptions  are  facilities  where  the  processes  used  might  have  resulted  in  the generation  of  concentrations  of  munitions  constituents  high  enough  to  present  an explosive  hazard.    Areas  where  previous  responses  have  been  completed  may  also qualify for “low” determinations. 15.6.2.1.3.  Immediate  reassessment  by  the  responsibility  authority  of  the  level  of construction  support  required  is  appropriate  upon  the  discovery  of  MEC  or  CA, regardless of CA configuration. 15.6.2.2.  Moderate  to  High  Probability.    Provide  “Onsite”  construction  support  to remove explosive or CA hazards in the construction footprint, per a DDESB-approved Munitions  Response  Explosives  Safety  Submission  (MRESS)  or  Munitions  Response Chemical Safety Submission (MRCSS), before intrusive construction or other intrusive activities occur. Note:  When the depth of intrusive activities exceeds the detection limits of the detection equipment used, remove soil in layers to allow detection and removal of MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, in the construction footprint. 15.6.2.2.1.  A “moderate to high” determination may be assigned to those areas where a  search  of  available  historical  records  or  onsite  investigation  data  indicates  that, given  the  military  or  munitions-related  activities  that  occurred  at  the  site,  there  is more than a low probability that MEC or CA are present. 15.6.2.2.2.  Munitions-related  activities  that  may  merit  a  “moderate  to  high” determination include, but are not limited to, the former use of the area for live-fire training  other  than  exclusively  with  small  arms  ammunition;  as  operational  range impact  areas;  for  OB  or  OD  of  munitions;  as  munitions  operating  facilities  where processes used might have resulted in the generation of concentrations of munitions constituents high enough to present an explosive hazard; for munitions burial; or for any activities involving CA. 15.7.  Anomaly Avoidance. 15.7.1.  The  use  of  anomaly  avoidance  techniques  is  appropriate  on  properties  known  or suspected  to  contain  UXO  or  other  munitions  (e.g.,  DMM)  that  may  have  experienced AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 381 abnormal  environments  to  allow  the  below  activities  in  such  areas  while  avoiding  surface explosive  or  CA  hazards  and,  when  necessary,  subsurface  anomalies.    Use  anomaly avoidance when: 15.7.1.1.  Avoid  surface  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA  configuration,  during  any activities  that  require  entry  to  the  area  (e.g.,  collections  of  environmental  samples,  the conduct of cultural resource studies). 15.7.1.2.  Avoid  subsurface  anomalies  during  any environmental monitory wells). 15.7.2.  During anomaly avoidance: intrusive  work  (e.g.,  drilling 15.7.2.1.  Provide  EOD  escort  support  or  within  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain MEC,  excluding  CA,  regardless  of  configuration,  by  UXO-qualified  personnel  as outlined in DDESB TP 18. (T-0). 15.7.2.2.  Within areas known or suspected to contain CA, regardless of configuration, to include  areas  where  such  CA  is  commingled  with  other  MEC,  by  UXO-qualified personnel trained in CWM responses. (T-0). 15.7.2.3.  Explosives safety requires that discovered surface MEC or CA, regardless of CA  configuration,  be  avoided  and  their  location  noted  and  reported  to  appropriate authorities. (T-0). 15.7.2.4.  Detected subsurface anomalies must not be investigated, but must be marked, when appropriate, and avoided. (T-0). 15.8.  Frost Heave. 15.8.1.  This phenomenon occurs when three conditions are met; freezing temperatures are present in the soil column, the soil is frost susceptible, and there is sufficient moisture present in the soil to cause soil movement upon ice crystal formation.  Evaluate these three factors to assess  the  likelihood  of  frost  heave  moving  residual  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA configuration, upward through the soil column. 15.8.2.  Where frost heave may have such an effect, explosives safety requires procedures be implemented  to  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  response  actions  for  the  affected  area  (Other naturally  occurring  phenomena,  e.g.,  erosion,  tidal  changes,  could  necessitate  similar monitoring). 15.9.  Soil Containing CA. 15.9.1.  The criteria below apply to soil known to be contaminated with one or more of the following  CA:  mustard,  L,  GD,  GA/GB,  O-cyclohexyl  Methylphosphono-flouridate  (GF) (common name is cylcosarin), or VX.  This criteria applies only if a headspace measurement is at or above the Short Term Exposure Limits (STEL) or a laboratory extraction sample is at or above the Hazardous Waste Control Limit (HWCL) for solid materials: mustard, L, GD, GA/GB, GF, or VX.  Certain CA-related operations, such as taking core samples at a suspect CWM or CA burial site, require laboratory extraction sampling (see paragraph 15.9.4.1.). 15.9.2.  Soil where no evidence exists of CA contamination and does not require treatment or remediation. 382 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 15.9.3.  An appendix to the site’s Site Safety and Health Plan that addresses the procedures (e.g., personnel protection, monitoring, sampling, packaging, and disposal) for the handling and  disposition  of  CA-contaminated  soil  is  required  for  environmental  responses  to  soil known or suspected to be contaminated with CA. 15.9.4.  Use air-sampling methods to detect CA during CWM responses.  When encountering soil contaminated with CA and an air concentration is at or above the STEL, based on off-gas monitoring of the headspace of a container or of air in the immediate area of the operation, appropriate  personal  protective  measures  must  be  employed.  (T-1).   In  addition, decontaminate the CA-contaminated soil to below the HWCL levels of paragraph 15.9.4.2. unless  the  CA-contaminated  soil  is  shipped  per  DOT  regulations  and  approvals  and  a receiving  Treatment  Storage  Disposal  Facility  (TSDF)  is  qualified  to  process  the  CA-contaminated soil per Federal, State, interstate, and local laws and regulations. (T-0).  If air monitoring is below the STEL, soil samples will be taken to determine if the soil exceeds the HWCL. (T-0). 15.9.4.1.  The STELs for air sampling CA contamination are: 15.9.4.1.1.  0.003 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) for mustard  (H,  HD, or  HT) agent. 15.9.4.1.2.  0.003 mg/m3 for L. 15.9.4.1.3.  0.0002 mg/m3 for GD/GF. 15.9.4.1.4.  0.0001 mg/m3 for GA/GB. 15.9.4.1.5.  0.00001 mg/m3 for VX. 15.9.4.2.  When encountering soil contaminated with CA at or above the HWCL levels listed in Table 15.1., as determined by laboratory extraction and analysis of soil samples, decontaminate  the  CA-contaminated  soil  to  below  the  levels  listed  for  HWCL,  or  to  a level required by Federal, State, interstate, and local laws and regulations. (T-0). Table 15.1.  Hazardous Waste Control Limits (HWCL).  15.9.5.  Once decontaminated to the appropriate level, package the CA-contaminated waste in  a  DOT-approved  shipping  container  and  ship  to  an  approved,  licensed  treatment  or disposal facility per Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. (T-0).  Maintain records of disposition by the generator per Federal, State, interstate, and local laws and regulations, managed  IAW  AFMAN  33-363  and  dispose  IAW  the  Air  Force  Records  Disposition Schedule. (T-1). 15.9.6.  Dispose  of  soil  that  is  found  to  be  below  the  HWCL,  but  above  the  levels  of paragraph  15.9.7.,  as  hazardous  waste  per  Federal,  State,  interstate,  and  local  laws  and AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 383 regulations  or  treatby  an  approved,  licensed  treatment  or  disposal  facility  to  the  levels  of paragraph 15.9.7. (T-1). 15.9.7.  Soil that is at or below the Health-Based Environmental Screening Levels (HBESL) for residential or industrial soil listed in Table 15.2., as appropriate, may be used or disposed of per Federal, State, interstate, and local laws and regulations (e.g., returned to the hole or disposed of as non-contaminated, non-hazardous material. Table 15.2.  Health-Based Environmental Screening Levels (HBESL).  Section 15E—Required Explosives Safety Submissions (MRESS, MRCSS and Munitions Response Explosives or CWM Site Plans) 15.10.  General.  Submit plans for leasing, transferring, or disposing of USAF real property (see AFI  32-9004)  when  AE  are  present,  or  are  suspected  to  be  present,  through  command  safety channels to AFSEC/SEW, and in turn to AFCEC/CXD, for submission to the DDESB for review and approval. (T-1). 15.10.1.  Explosives and CA safety requires: 15.10.1.1.

An AFSEC/SEW review and approval pending DDESB review and approval of the submission, provided the submission is at the DDESB for review and approval and the  submitting  MAJCOM  understands  that  DDESB  approval  may  impose  different  or additional munitions or CWM response requirements. (T-0). 15.10.2.  A DDESB-approved MRESS or MRCSS, or an explosives or CWM site plan, or a combination thereof, is required for: 15.10.2.1.  MRS  investigation  or  characterization  (e.g.,  Engineering  Evaluation/Cost Analysis (EE/CA) or Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS)) that involves the intentional  physical  contact  with  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA  configuration  (see paragraph 15.10.4.).    (T-0). 15.10.2.2.  A  determination  of  “No  DoD  Action  Indicated”  (NDAI)  or  “No  Further Action” (NOFA) (see paragraph 15.10.5.). (T-0). 15.10.2.3.

Execution  of  the  explosives  safety  or  CA  safety  aspects  of  the  selected response (see paragraphs 15.10.8. and  15.10.9.). (T-0). 15.10.3.  A DDESB-approved MRESS or MRCSS, or a munitions response explosives site plan (ESP) or CWM site plan (CSP) is not required for: 15.10.3.1.  Emergency munitions or explosives responses. 15.10.3.2.  Preliminary  assessments  or  site  inspections  (e.g.,  site  visits  in  conjunction with an archival search) when intentional physical contact with MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, or the conduct of ground-disturbing or other intrusive activities are not intended (see paragraph 15.10.3.6.). 15.10.3.3.  Clearance  activities  on  operational  ranges  (addressing  military  munitions burial sites on operational ranges is not a clearance activity). 15.10.3.4.  Munitions responses on former ranges used exclusively for training with small arms ammunition. 15.10.3.5.  On-call construction support. 15.10.3.6.  Anomaly avoidance activities. 15.10.4.  A munitions response ESP or, when appropriate, CSP for an MRS investigation or characterization involving intentional physical contact with MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration.

Such  site  plans  will  address  areas  (e.g.,  magazines)  used  for  the  storage  of commercial  or  military  demolition  explosives,  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA configuration; planned or established demolition or disposal areas; and the MRA, MRS, or response area boundaries (see paragraph 15.10.8.3.7.). (T-0). 15.10.4.2.  Use  MRS  investigations  and  characterizations  to  collect  the  information needed  to  design  the  required  munitions  response  and  to  prepare,  as  appropriate,  an MRESS or MRCSS for the selected response. (T-0). 15.10.5.  An  NDAI  or  NOFA  MRESS  or  MRCSS.    When  making  an  NDAI  or  NOFA decision for an MRA or MRS or for a response area, a munitions response ESP or CSP must, at a minimum, provide: (T-0). 15.10.5.1.  The site identification (i.e., name, unique identifier). 15.10.5.2.  The site location. 15.10.5.3.  Justification for the decision. 15.10.6.  A  TCRA  MRESS  or  MRCSS.    To  expedite  the  approval  process,  installations should submit a TCRA MRESS or MRCSS electronically through their chain of command to the DDESB. (T-1).  A TCRA MRESS or MRCSS must, at a minimum, identify or provide: (T-0). 15.10.6.1.  The site identification (e.g., name, unique identifier). 15.10.6.2.

Nonessential  personnel  is  the  greatest  distance  of  blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D = 40W1/3 or the calculated HFD. 15.10.8.3.2.1.2.  Team  Separation  distance (TSD) overpressure, as computed by the formula: D = 40W1/3. is  based  on  blast 15.10.8.3.2.2.  The  MSD  for  intentional  detonations,  which  may  be  reduced  by employing DDESB-approved engineering controls, is the greatest distance of (see Chapter 12): 15.10.8.3.2.2.1.  Blast overpressure,  as computed by using the formula:  D = 328W1/3. 15.10.8.3.2.2.2.  The  calculated  Maximum  Fragment  Distance  (MFD)  (see Chapter 12). 15.10.8.3.3.

There is no required ESQD protection for essential personnel from locations they are using for storage. 15.10.8.3.3.3.  The IMD, based on the Net Explosive Weight Quantity Distance (NEWQD) of the munition with the greatest NEWQD that is reasonably expected to  be  encountered,  applies  from  intrusive  operations  to  storage  sites  to  prevent propagation  to  a  storage  location  in  event  of  an  accidental  explosion  during intrusive  operations.    For  distances  less  than  IMD,  use  DDESB-approved engineering controls during intrusive operations. (T-1). 15.10.8.3.4.  Planned  or  Established  Demolition  Areas.    A  planned  or  established demolition area is an area used repetitively to destroy munitions during a munitions response.    Such  areas  may  be  an  existing  OD  area  or  a  new  area  planned  for intentional detonation.  Provide an ESQD arc around demolition areas. (T-1).  Base the size of the ESQD arc on requirements of this Manual (see Chapter 12). 15.10.8.3.5.  Mechanized  MEC  Processing  Operations,  Excluding  CA-filled Munitions. 15.10.8.3.5.1.  Classify these processing operations as either “high input” or “low input” based on a risk assessment that considers the degree of energy the process would impact any MEC potentially processed. (T-1). 15.10.8.3.5.1.1.  High-input  processing  operations  (e.g.,  shredders,  crushers) intend to physically deform material including any MEC being processed, and certain excavations depending upon the risk assessment. 15.10.8.3.5.1.2.  Low-input  processing  operations  (e.g.,  on-site  transport, dumping,  screening,  raking,  spreading,  sifting,  and  magnetically  separating) are  not  intended  to  intentionally  deform  material  including  MEC  being processed, and certain excavations depending upon the risk assessment. 15.10.8.3.5.2.  Personnel Separation Distances. 15.10.8.3.5.2.1.  Nonessential Personnel. 15.10.8.3.5.2.1.1.  During  high-input  processing  operations,  provide nonessential  personnel  protection  for  intentional  detonations  based  on  the MGFD (see paragraph 15.10.8.3.2.2.). (T-0). 15.10.8.3.5.2.1.2.  During provide nonessential personnel protection for accidental (unintentional) detonations (greater of HFD or K40). (T-0). processing low-input operations 15.10.8.3.5.2.2.  Essential Personnel.  For both high- and low-input processing operations, essential personnel must: (T-0). 388 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 15.10.8.3.5.2.2.1.  Be protected by shields or barricades designed to defeat hazardous fragments from the MGFD. 15.10.8.3.5.2.2.2.  Be  separated  from  the  operation  by  K24  based  on  the munition  with  the  greatest  NEWQD  that  is  reasonably  expected  to  be encountered. Note: DDESB-approved overpressure-mitigating engineering controls may be used to provide an equivalent level of protection (2.3 psi). 15.10.8.3.6.  Intentional  Burning  of  Buildings  Contaminated  with  Explosives Residues  that  Present  an  Explosive  Hazard.    Separate  all  personnel  by  K328 overpressure distance based on the MCE for the building, but not less than 1,250 feet. (T-0). 15.10.8.3.7.  ESQD Maps. 15.10.8.3.7.1.  ESQD-maps must be to scale and legible per paragraph 14.24.2. (T-0). 15.10.8.3.7.2.  When a map does not contain a scale, all distances must be labeled. (T-0). 15.10.8.3.7.3.  The ESQD map must show the following: (T-0). 15.10.8.3.7.3.1.  Each MRA or MRS. 15.10.8.3.7.3.2.  The  storage  locations  for  demolition  explosives  and  for recovered MEC. 15.10.8.3.7.3.3.

Such locations include areas where contained detonation technology will be used. 15.10.8.3.7.3.4.  All ES and PES and their relationships. 15.10.8.3.7.3.5.  All controlling ESQD arcs. the Note:  Describe any protective measures (e.g., evacuation of inhabited buildings, blocking off public highways) that will be used to eliminate or minimize any exposures within the established exclusion zone. (T-0). 15.10.8.3.7.4.  ESQD Arcs.  ESQD arcs must be shown for: (T-0). 15.10.8.3.7.4.1.  Munitions.    Use  the  MGFD  for  ESQD  purposes  for  any particular MRA or MRS.  However, if a munition with a greater fragmentation distance is encountered during the conduct of a munitions response, adjust the ESQD arcs and amend the MRESS or munitions response ESP. 15.10.8.3.7.4.2.  Explosive  Soil.    To  determine  the  ESQD  arc  for  explosive soil,  calculate  the  MCE  by  multiplying  the  weight  of  the  mix  by  the concentration of explosives (e.g., 1,000 lb of soil containing 15 percent TNT has  an  MCE  of  150  lb).    When  concentrations  vary  within  the  site,  use weighted  averages  or  other  valid  mathematical  techniques  to  determine  the exclusion zone; however, the MRESS must support their use.  The MSD for AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 389 nonessential personnel must be the greater of IBD for overpressure or the soil ejecta radius per DDESB-approved procedures. 15.10.8.3.7.4.3.  Real Property (Buildings and Installed Equipment).  For real property  that  is  known  or  suspected  to  be  contaminated  with  explosives residues  that  present  an  explosive  hazard,  and  that  is  slated  for  cleanup  or dismantlement, estimate the MCE on a case-by-case basis.  The MRESS must include the rationale used for the estimation. 15.10.8.3.8.  Soil  Sampling  Maps.    When  the  property  involves  concentrations  of explosives  in  the  soil  that  are  high  enough  to  present  an  explosive  hazard  (see paragraph 15.4.): 15.10.8.3.8.1.  Provide a map that indicates areas containing explosive soil. (T-0). 15.10.8.3.8.2.  Address methods (e.g., blending, bio-remediation) used to reduce explosives concentrations to a non-reactive level. (T-0). 15.10.8.3.8.3.  Address  methods  (e.g.,  wetting  the  soil  before  blending)  used  to reduce any explosive hazards. (T-0). 15.10.8.4.  Types of MEC.  Based on research or data generated from characterization of the  MRA  or  MRs,  provide  the  types  of  MEC  expected  to  be  encountered  during munitions response activities. (T-0). 15.10.8.5.  Start Date. 15.10.8.5.1.  Provide the expected date that munitions response activities that involve the placement of explosives on a site, the intentional physical contact with MEC, or the conduct of ground-disturbing or intrusive activities in areas known or suspected to contain MEC are scheduled to start. (T-0). 15.10.8.5.2.  Indicate the potential consequence, if any, if DDESB approval does not occur  by  the  start  date.    Site  preparation  activities  (e.g.,  surveying,  gridding,  or locating  anomalies)  may  be  conducted  while  awaiting  DDESB  approval  of  the MRESS. 15.10.8.6.  MEC  Migration.    Describe  naturally  occurring  phenomena  (e.g.,  drought, flooding, erosion, frost heave, tidal changes) that could cause the migration or exposure of MEC, and procedures for monitoring and managing such. (T-0). 15.10.8.7.  Detection Equipment and Response Techniques.  The intent of this section is to  describe  the  capabilities  of  detection  equipment  relative  to  the  degree  of  removal required to support the current, determined, or reasonably anticipated end use. (T-0). 15.10.8.7.1.  Describe the techniques used to detect and remove MEC. 15.10.8.7.2.  Identify the types of detection equipment to be used and the areas they will be employed. 15.10.8.7.3.  Summarize  methods  used  (e.g.,  test  plots)  to  establish  the  expected detection capabilities of the equipment used.  If anomaly discrimination will be used, explain  what  methods  will  be  used  to  establish  the  expected  accuracy  of  the discrimination. 390 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 15.10.8.7.4.  When describing the detection methods: 15.10.8.7.4.1.  Describe  the  rationale  (e.g.,  best  available  technology  based  on geology,  topography,  munitions  characteristics,  resource  requirements)  used  to select the detection methods and technologies to be used during the response. (T-0). 15.10.8.7.4.2.  Address  any  limitations  (e.g.,  equipment,  terrain,  soil  type)  and mitigating actions, if any. (T-0). 15.10.8.7.4.3.  Describe quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) standards and pass or fail criteria for QA/QC control audits. (T-0). 15.10.8.8.  Disposition Techniques. 15.10.8.8.1.

Briefly  describe the  MEC,  excluding  CA-filled  munitions, disposition  techniques  (e.g.,  OB,  OD,  contained  detonation,  incineration)  to  be used. (T-0). 15.10.8.8.1.2.  When recovered MEC, excluding CA-filled munitions, cannot be destroyed within the MRA or MRS, address how explosives safety requirements will  be  met  during  transportation  and  during  offsite  storage,  treatment,  or disposal. (T-0). Note:  Disposition actions must consider requirements applicable to waste military munitions. (T-0). 15.10.8.8.2.  Material  Potentially  Presenting  an  Explosive  Hazard  (MPPEH).  Describe the process to be used to manage MPPEH (see Chapter 9, MPPEH, DoDI 4140.62, Material Potentially Presenting an Explosive Hazard (MPPEH), and DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7, Enclosure 6). (T-0). 15.10.8.9.  Environmental, Ecological, Cultural and Other Considerations.  Address any environmental, ecological (e.g., endangered species), cultural (e.g., archaeological, tribal spiritual  or  gathering  sites)  and  other  factors  that  impacted,  from  an  explosives  safety perspective, the selection of the munitions response. (T-0). 15.10.8.10.  Technical  Support.    Summarize  EOD,  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command/20th Support  Command/22nd  Chemical  Battalion,  or  UXO-technician  or  UXO-qualified personnel support that may be required.  Any Munitions Response ESS or Work Site Plan that references the use of local EOD to dispose of military munitions must be coordinated with the tasked Service installation EOD unit. (T-0). Note:  U.S. Army Forces Command/20th Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion is manned with specially trained personnel that provide verification, sampling, detection, mitigation, RSP, decontamination, packaging, escort, and remediation of chemical, biological and industrial devices or hazardous materials. 15.10.8.11.  Residual RM.  Address: 15.10.8.11.1.  LUCs.    The  MRESS  must  summarize  any  LUCs  to  be  implemented and maintained on the property. (T-0). AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 391 15.10.8.11.2.  Long-Term Management.  The MRESS must address the management of any potential residual risks. (T-0). 15.10.8.12.  Safety  Education  Program.    Address  methods  to  be  used  to  educate  the public on the risks associated with MEC and CA, regardless of CA configuration. (T-0). 15.10.8.13.  Stakeholder  Involvement.    Briefly,  summarize  how  stakeholder  concerns affecting the explosives safety aspects of the selected munitions response were addressed. (T-0). 15.10.8.14.  Contingencies.  To reduce the need to submit amendments (see paragraph 15.11.1.),  an  MRESS  may  describe  alternative  actions  that  could  be  used  to  address contingencies  (e.g.,an  MRESS  may  list  alternative  DDESB-approved  engineering controls that may be used under specified conditions). 15.10.8.15.  Unexpected CA Discoveries.  When CA, regardless of its configuration, is discovered during munitions responses to MEC, excluding CA-filled munitions, halt all onsite  activities  until  the  need  for  a  CWM  response  is  evaluated  and  a  decision  is approved  by  the  Service-level  explosives  safety  office.  (T-0).    If  it  is  decided  that  a CWM response is necessary, do not begin response actions that involve the intentional physical  contact  with  CA,  regardless  of  configuration,  or  the  conduct  of  ground-disturbing or other intrusive activities in areas known or suspected to contain CA until DDESB approves the required MRCSS or munitions response CSP. (T-0). 15.10.9.  Selected MRCSS and Munitions Response CSPs. 15.10.9.1.  General. 15.10.9.1.1.  A response in an area (i.e., a munitions response in an MRA or MRS) that is known or suspected to contain CA, regardless of configuration, must include a CWM  site  plan  for  an  Interim  Holding  Facility  (IHF)  and,  when  the  use  of  onsite destruction technology is planned, for the site where those destruction activities will occur. (T-0).  Generally, the information required in an MRCSS parallels that for an MRESS  (see  paragraph  15.10.8.);  however,  such  information  will  be  tailored  to address CWM. 15.10.9.1.2.  An MRCSS is not required for certain activities on a site with a history of CA-related activities when an installation or district Commander, or a command-designated  representative,  has  approved  a  probability  assessment  finding  for  such activities stating that the probability of discovering CA is expected to be “seldom” or “unlikely.” However, the site safety and health plan must include contingency plans providing  for  the  safe  and  expeditious  evacuation  of  the  site  in  the  event  CA  is discovered. (T-0). 15.10.9.1.3.  When  CA,  regardless  of  configuration,  is  discovered  during  these activities, halt all onsite activities until the need for a CWM response is evaluated and a decision is approved by the Service-level explosives safety office. (T-0). 15.10.9.1.4.  If  a  CWM  response  is  necessary,  do  not  begin  response  actions  that involve the intentional physical contact with CA, regardless of configuration, and/or the  conduct  of  ground-disturbing  or  other  intrusive  activities  in  areas  known  or 392 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 suspected to contain CA until DDESB approves the required MRCSS or munitions response CSP. (T-0). 15.10.9.2.  Explosives  Hazards.    When  explosives  hazards  are  known  or  suspected  to exist  along  with  CA  hazards  within  a  response  area  (e.g.,  the  MRA  or  MRS),  a submission addressing both explosives safety and CA safety (as outlined in this section) is required (see paragraph 15.10.8.). (T-0). 15.10.9.3.  Background (see paragraph 15.10.8.1.). 15.10.9.4.  Maps.    The  maps  provided  with  a  MRCSS  must  meet  the  requirements  of paragraph 15.10.8.2. (T-0).  In addition, show the one percent lethality distance and the IBD. (T-0). 15.10.9.5.  Chemical Agent Hazards.  When CA hazards are known or suspected to exist within a response area (e.g., the MRA or MRS), consider the CA downwind hazard when determining the MSD.  Provide the following information in the MRCSS: (T-0). 15.10.9.5.1.  A description of the CA MCE. 15.10.9.5.2.  A description of how essential and nonessential personnel and the public will  be  protected  should  the  CA  MCE  occur  (see  DoD  6055.09-M,  Volume  6)  for basic personnel protection requirements (e.g., hazard zones and protective equipment) for  operations  involving  CWM.    If  an  Engineering  Control  (EC),  has  not  been DDESB-approved, is to be used to provide such protection, the MRCSS must include the technical data substantiating the new engineering control’s effectiveness.  EC may be used for: 15.10.9.5.2.1.  Protection  from  overpressure  and  fragments  when  explosively configured CWM are known or suspected. 15.10.9.5.2.2.  Protection  from  CA  effects  (prevent  vapor  releases  to  the environment) during both response activities and when RCWM is stored in the IHF. 15.10.9.6.  RCWM Hazard Classification and Storage. 15.10.9.6.1.  Store  RCWM,  suspected  or  confirmed,  regardless  of  its  configuration, separately  from  serviceable  munitions  and  from  other  MEC.  (T-0).    Additionally, store suspect RCWM separately from all other munitions and from RCWM. (T-0). 15.10.9.6.2.  Manage  suspect  and  known  RCWM  as  HD  1.1  until  stowed  in  an approved  overpack  container  or  until  determined  not  to  be  RCWM  or  to  be  non-explosively  configured  RCWM  (see  paragraphs  15.10.8.3.3.  and  paragraph 15.10.9.6.4., as applicable). (T-0). Note:  For paragraphs 15.10.9.6.1. and 15.10.9.6.2. consider the CA downwind hazard with the greater of the two distances used for siting purposes. 15.10.9.6.3.  Manage  explosively-configured  RCWM  in  an  approved  overpack container as HD 1.2.1. with an explosive MCE of one round or HD 1.2.2, based on its NEWQD. (T-0).  Consider such storage HD 1.1 if advantageous for computing HFD using DDESB-approved procedures. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 393 15.10.9.6.4.  Manage non-explosively configured RCWM as HD 6.1. (T-0).  Use the CA downwind hazard for siting purposes. 15.10.9.7.  CWM Site Plan.  A DDESB-approved CWM Site Plan for an IHF is required when CA, regardless of configuration, is known or suspected to exist on a response area. (T-0).    The  IHF  Site  Plan,  based  on  the  worst-case  CA  configuration  expected  to  be encountered, is included in the MRCSS.  The IHF site plan must: (T-0). 15.10.9.7.1.  Identify the public access exclusion distance (PAED). 15.10.9.7.2.  Identify all associated ESQD arcs (see paragraph 15.10.8.3.). 15.10.9.7.3.

RCWM  assessment  activities  (e.g.,  X-ray,  portable  isotopic neutron spectroscopy (PINS)). 15.10.9.7.5.3.  Transportation preparation activities (e.g., transloading of multiple round containers (MRCs), MRC movement into or out of the IHF). 15.10.9.7.6.  Address soil sampling maps (see paragraph 15.10.8.3.8.). 15.10.9.7.7.  Address types of CA (see paragraph 15.10.8.4.). 15.10.9.7.8.  Address start date (see paragraph 15.10.8.5.). 15.10.9.7.9.  Detection  Equipment  and  Response  Techniques  (see  paragraph 15.10.8.7.). 15.10.9.7.10.  Disposition Techniques. 15.10.9.7.10.1.  CA, Regardless of Configuration. 15.10.9.7.10.1.1.  Briefly,  describe  the  disposition  techniques  (e.g.,  onsite destruction) to be used. 15.10.9.7.10.1.2.  When RCWM cannot be destroyed on site, address how CA safety  and, if applicable, explosives safety requirements, will  be met during transportation  and  during  offsite  storage,  treatment  or  disposal.  (T-1).  Disposition  actions  must  consider  guidance  applicable  to  waste  military munitions. 15.10.9.7.10.2.  MPPEH.  Describe the MPPEH management process to be used (see Chapter 9, MPPEH and DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7, Enclosure 6). 15.10.9.7.11.

Contingencies (see paragraph 15.10.8.14.). 15.10.9.7.16.  Unexpected  MEC  or  Explosively  Configured  CWM  Discoveries.  When  unexpected  MEC  or  explosively  configured  CWM  is  discovered  during  a CWM response, halt all onsite activities that involve intentional physical contact with such MEC or explosively configured CWM, or the conduct of ground-disturbing or other  intrusive  activities  in  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain  such  MEC  or explosively  configured  CWM,  until  the  newly  identified  explosive  hazards  are evaluated and the DDESB approves all required MRCSS amendments or explosive site plans. (T-0). Section 15F—Amendments and Corrections 15.11.  General.  An  amendment  or  correction  to  an  approved  MRESS  or  MRCSS  does  not require  the  resubmission  of  the  complete  MRESS  or  MRCSS  package.    However,  the information submitted must be in sufficient detail to identify the specific MRESS or MRCSS being amended or corrected, the affected portions, and the precise amendments or corrections. (T-0). 15.11.1.  Amendments.    Amendments  are  only  required  when  a  change  to  an  approved MRESS  or  MRCSS  increases  explosives  safety  or  CA  risks,  identifies  requirements  for additional or increased explosive or CA hazard controls, or increases or decreases an ESQD arc. 15.11.1.1.  An amendment requires DDESB approval before the affected response actions can  continue.    However,  response  actions  need  not  be  stopped  pending  such  approval provided: 15.11.1.1.1.  The  amendment  pertains  to  an  area  (e.g.,  MRA  or  MRS)  where  an MRESS or MRCSS has already been approved. 15.11.1.1.2.  The MAJCOM, in coordination with AFSEC/SEW: 15.11.1.1.2.1.  Institutes  protective  measures  (e.g.,  increased  ESQD,  use  of DDESB-approved EC) to address any explosive or CA hazards. 15.11.1.1.2.2.  Accepts  the  possibility  that  the  DDESB  approval  process  may impose different or additional explosives safety or CA safety requirements. 15.11.1.2.  If  the  amendment  is  for  a  new  response  area  (e.g.,  a  new  MRS),  then  the DDESB  must  approve  the  amendment  before  intrusive  activities  begin  in  the  new response area. (T-0). 15.11.1.3.  To  allow  the  response  to  continue  with  minimal  interruption,  process amendments by electronic means. 15.11.1.4.  Changes that require an amendment include: 15.11.1.4.1.  Constraints  in  funding,  technology,  access,  and  other  site-specific conditions that impact the degree of removal addressed in the approved MRESS or MRCSS. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 395 15.11.1.4.2.  Any increase or decrease of the ESQD arcs. 15.11.1.4.3.  A change in operations requiring explosives siting or re-siting of an IHF for CWM. 15.11.1.4.4.  Changes  in  LUC  or  long-term  management  to  address  residual  risks.  Such changes would not require intrusive activities to stop while the amendment is being processed. 15.11.2.  Corrections.  Corrections address changes to an approved MRESS or MRCSS that do not increase explosives safety or CA risks or exposures.  Corrections: 15.11.2.1.  Do not require approval. 15.11.2.2.  Are primarily administrative in nature and provided for information purposes. Section 15G—After Action Reports (AAR) 15.12.  General. 15.12.1.  An AAR for completed munitions or CWM responses is a required feature of all DDESB-approved  MRESSs  or  MRCSSs.    The  ARR’s  purpose  is  to  document  that  the explosives and chemical safety aspects of the selected response have been completed per the approved ESS or MRCSS.  In most cases, a “Statement of MEC Removal” or “Statement of Munitions Response MEC Removal Actions” fulfills the requirements in paragraph 15.12.2.  The  DDESB  Staff  acknowledges  receipt  of  an  AAR,  and  raises  any  issues  that  require resolution before land transfer or an alternative use can safely proceed. 15.12.2.  The AAR: 15.12.2.1.  Must be submitted through command channels to the DDESB. (T-1). 15.12.2.2.  May be submitted electronically. 15.12.2.3.  Remains part of the DDESB’s action file; however, installations will continue to be responsible for complying with all recordkeeping requirements. 15.12.2.4.  Summarize the MEC or CA found, regardless of CA configuration. 15.12.2.5.  Describes  the  relative  effectiveness  and  any  limitations  of  the  technologies used  during  the  munitions  response  or  CWM  response  and  the  effects  on  residual  risk relative to that originally projected. 15.12.2.6.  Includes maps showing: 15.12.2.6.1.  Areas where MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration, was removed. 15.12.2.6.2.  Areas  within  a  response  area  (e.g.,  within  an  MRA  or  MRS)  where response actions were not performed and the rationale for not addressing those areas. 15.12.2.6.3.  The known or reasonably anticipated end use of each area. 15.12.2.7.  Summarizes the LUCs implemented, if any, and the areas that apply. 15.12.2.8.  Must address provisions for long-term management. 396 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Section 15H—Transfer of Real Property outside DoD Control 15.13.  General.  AFI  32-9004,  Disposal  of  Real  Property,  managed  by  the  Air  Force  Civil Engineer  Center  (AFCEC),  addresses  contaminated  real  property.    Coordinate  activities associated with the disposal of contaminated real property with the installation civil engineer’s real estate division representative. 15.13.1.  Whenever disposal is contemplated, conduct an Environmental Baseline Survey to identify any hazardous conditions associated with the subject property, including UXO and other hazardous materials. 15.13.2.  Pursuant to DoD guidance on real property disposal, real property known to contain or suspected of containing explosive CA hazards may not be transferred out of DoD control (other  than  to  the  Coast  Guard)  until  the  Chairman,  DDESB,  has  approved  measures submitted  by  the  transferring  Component  to  ensure  the  recipient  of  the  property  is  fully informed  of  both  the  actual  and  potential  hazards  relating  to  the  presence  or  possible presence of explosives or CA, and restrictions or conditions placed on the use of the property to avoid harm to users due to the presence of explosives or CA. 15.13.3.  Notices.  A recipient of such DoD property must be provided details of any past explosives removal or remedial actions, including: (T-0). 15.13.3.1.  The degree of MEC or CA removal. 15.13.3.2.  The  process  used  to  determine  that  degree  of  removal  to  be  adequately protective. 15.13.3.3.  Written notification that detection and removal methods are not 100 percent effective, and that residual hazards may remain in areas (e.g., MRS) that were subjected to response actions. 15.13.4.  Restrictions and Conditions.  Based on potential explosive and CA hazards present and  the  projected  use  of  the  property,  impose  the  following  types  of  use  restrictions  and conditions, as appropriate, on such DoD property: 15.13.4.1.  A  prohibition  on  excavation  or  drilling  in  any  areas  known  or  suspected  to contain  MEC  or  CA,  regardless  of  CA  configuration,  without  appropriate  permits  or assistance. 15.13.4.2.  A prohibition on disturbing, removing, or destroying any found MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration. 15.13.4.3.  A requirement to immediately notify local law enforcement representatives of any discovery of MEC or CA, regardless of configuration. 15.13.4.4.  A  prohibition  on  the  construction  or  installation  of  particular  improvements including  utilities,  roadways,  airstrips,  navigable  waterways,  pipelines,  and  structures, both above and below ground. 15.13.4.5.  A  prohibition  on  specific  alterations,  extensions,  or  expansions  to  such improvements. 15.13.4.6.  A prohibition on certain types of uses, such as child care centers, housing, or farming. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 397 15.13.4.7.  A restriction to a specific type of use or owner, such as a state National Guard range. 15.13.4.8.  Inclusion of Air Force explosives and CA safety personnel and the Chairman, DDESB, in deliberations, decision making, and approvals pertaining to future munitions response activities to address MEC or CA, regardless of CA configuration. 15.13.4.9.  Inclusion of the restrictions and conditions in the recorded land records for the jurisdiction, to the extent allowed by state law. 398 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 SPECIAL STORAGE PROCEDURES FOR WASTE MILITARY MUNITIONS Chapter 16 Section 16A—Scope and Applicability 16.1.  Scope and Applicability. 16.1.1.  As referenced in DoD 6055.09-M, Volume 7, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  promulgated  the  Munitions  Rule  (MR),  Title  40,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations, Subpart  M  Parts  260-299,  Protection  of  the  Environment  to  define  when  chemical  and conventional military munitions become hazardous waste and to provide for the safe storage and transportation of such waste.  The MR takes precedence over these standards and sets forth two approaches for the storage of waste military munitions: 16.1.1.1.  A Conditional Exemption (CE) from certain RCRA requirements. 16.1.1.2.  A new RCRA storage unit standard (i.e., Subpart EE, of Parts 264 and 265 of 40 CFR). 16.1.2.  This  Chapter  establishes  additional  requirements  for  storage  of  waste  military munitions. Section 16B—General 16.2.  General. 16.2.1.  A military munition is a “waste” if it is a solid or hazardous waste under regulations implementing the RCRA, (42 U.S.C. Section 9601 et seq). 16.2.2.  An unused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs: 16.2.2.1.  The  munition  is  abandoned  by  disposal,  burning,  detonation  (except  during intended use), incineration, or treatment prior to disposal. 16.2.2.2.  The munition is removed from storage in a military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of disposal of, burning, or incineration, or treatment prior to disposal. 16.2.2.3.  The munition is deteriorated or damaged (i.e., the integrity of the munition is compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot be put into serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes. 16.2.2.4.  An authorized military official declared the munition a solid waste. 16.2.3.  A used or fired military munition is a solid waste: 16.2.3.1.  When transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is not a range, for the purposes of storage, reclamation, treatment, disposal, or treatment prior to disposal. 16.2.3.2.  If recovered, collected, and then disposed of by burial, or landfilling either on or off a range. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 399 16.2.4.  For purposes of RCRA section 1004(27), a used or fired military munition is a solid waste,  and,  therefore,  is  potentially  subject  to  RCRA  corrective  action  authorities  under section  3004(u)  and  (v),  and  section  3008  (h),  or  imminent  and  substantial  endangerment authorities under section 7003, if the munition lands off-range and is not promptly rendered safe and/or retrieved. 16.2.4.1.  Any imminent and substantial threats associated with any  remaining material must  be  addressed.    If  remedial  action  is  not  feasible,  the  operator  of  the  range  must maintain a record of the event for as long as any threat remains. (T-1). 16.2.4.2.  The record must include the type of munition and its location (to the extent the location  is  known).  (T-1).    For  further  clarification  see  40  CFR  Part  266.202  under Definition of Solid Waste. Section 16C—Waivers and Exemptions 16.3.  Waivers and Exemptions. 16.3.1.  CE Storage.  Waivers and exemptions from this standard are not authorized for AE storage facilities storing CE waste military munitions. 16.3.2.  RCRA Storage.  Waivers and exemptions from this Standard will only be available to units storing waste munitions under RCRA unit standards (e.g., of 40 CFR Subpart EE Part 264).  The approval level for all waivers/exemptions is the Secretary of the Air Force.  Approvals may be delegated no lower than the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. Section 16D—Storage Requirements 16.4.  Requirements for Storage of Waste Military Munitions Under CE. 16.4.1.  Installations storing waste military munitions under CE must comply with 40 CFR §266.205(a). (T-0). Note:  The MR-established CE does not apply to chemical agents or toxic chemical munitions. 16.4.2.  Each installation must maintain records, for a minimum of three years from the last day the waste munitions were stored describing: (T-1). 16.4.2.1.  The  type  of  waste  military  munitions  stored  by  standard  nomenclature,  Lot Number,  Federal  Supply  Class  (FSC),  National  Stock  Number  (NSN),  Department  of Defense Ammunition Code (DODAC), condition code, and quantity of each type waste military  munitions  stored.    A  separate  record  or  line  item  is  required  for  each  type  of munition in any mixed lot of munitions received for storage. 16.4.2.2.  The date that each military munitions, by type, was identified as waste. 16.4.2.3.  The last storage date for each, by type of waste military munitions. 16.4.2.4.  The storage location or locations (e.g., building number or storage pad, and grid coordinates) used. 16.4.2.5.  The disposition (e.g., destroyed, demilitarized, shipped) and date of action, by type of waste munitions. 400 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 16.4.2.6.  When  applicable,  the  sending  and  receiving  sites  for  those  waste  military munitions received from or shipped to off-site sources. 16.4.3.  Physically separate (e.g., on a separate pallet or shelf, etc.) waste military munitions from non-waste military munitions when both are stored in the same AE storage facility. (T-1). 16.4.4.  Clearly mark the segregated waste military munitions to ensure proper identification.  (T-1). 16.4.5.  Store waste munitions under CE in AE storage facilities that comply (without waiver or exemption) with the provisions of this standard.  Include each AE storage facility storing waste  military  munitions  or  explosives  under  CE  in  a  DDESB-approved  ESP  that  the installation keeps on file.  Those portions of the ESP addressing AE storage facilities storing waste  military  munitions  under  CE  must  be  available  to  appropriate  Federal  or  State environmental regulatory authority upon request. 16.4.6.  Installations must develop local operating instructions or plans that are designed to provide safety, security, and environmental protection. (T-1).  Coordinate these plans with the  appropriate  Federal,  State,  and  Local  emergency  response  authorities  (e.g.,  law enforcement, fire departments, hospitals, and etc.) and established planning committees. Section 16E—Loss of CE 16.5.  Loss of CE. 16.5.1.  The  unpermitted  or  uncontrolled  detonation,  release,  discharge,  or  migration  (e.g., loss or theft, or as a result of fire or explosion, etc.) of waste military munitions out of any storage unit that might endanger human health or the environment results in the immediate loss of CE for those waste military munitions.  Incidents of this nature and the loss of CE require reporting per paragraph 16.7. 16.5.2.  The appropriate Federal or State environmental regulatory authorities may withdraw CE based on review or inspection of the installation’s or responsible activity’s compliance with the requirements for storage of waste military munitions under CE.  AFSEC/SEW may, at any time; restrict an activity from using CE.  In addition, the DDESB or AFSEC/SEW, upon discovery of a condition that could warrant loss of CE, will report the condition to the Commander of the installation or responsible activity. (T-1). 16.5.3.  If  CE  is  lost,  the  waste  military  munitions  are  subject  to  other  RCRA  hazardous waste regulations.  The installation or responsible activities must obtain any required RCRA permits because of the loss of CE. (T-1). 16.5.4.  Installations  and  responsible  activities  may  apply  for  reinstatement  of  CE  per  40 CFR Part 266.205(c). 16.6.  Other Storage Standards. 16.6.1.  Many  States  regulate  waste  management  activities,  including  the  storage  of  waste military munitions.   In the event such State regulations conflict with Air Force explosives safety standards, AFSEC/SEW will attempt to resolve the conflict. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 401 16.6.2.  For those issues that cannot be resolved, AFSEC/SEW will notify the DDESB of any irreconcilable conflict of State law, regulation, or directive with these or other DoD or Air Force explosives safety standards.  The Chairman, DDESB, will review the law, regulation, or  directive  for  any  potential  impact  on  explosives  safety  and  will  assist  AFSEC/SEW, in coordination  with  the  Deputy  Under  Secretary  of  Defense  (Installations  and  Environment) (DUSD  IE),  in  resolving  such  regulatory  conflicts.    Nothing  in  this  paragraph  affects  the component’s  right  to  seek  review  of  the  State  law,  regulation,  or  directive  in  a  court  of competent jurisdiction. 16.7.  Un-Permitted and Uncontrolled Loss Reporting. 16.7.1.  In addition to other applicable reporting requirements, installations and responsible activities  will  notify  AFSEC/SEW  (through  MAJCOM),  the  appropriate  Federal  or  State environmental  regulatory  authority  IAW  40  CFR  Part  266.205  (a)  (1)  (v),  and  established local committees as follows: (T-1). 16.7.1.1.  Telephonically  or  electronically  (by  e-mail  message  or  facsimile)  within  24 hours  from  the  time  the  installation  or  responsible  activity  becomes  aware  of  any unpermitted or uncontrolled detonation, release, discharge, or migration of waste military munitions out of any storage unit (e.g., loss or theft, or as a result of fire or explosion, etc.) that endangers human health or the environment. 16.7.1.2.  In writing, if the initial report was telephonic, within five days from the time the installation or responsible activity becomes aware of any unpermitted or uncontrolled detonation, release, discharge, or migration of  waste military munitions out of any AE storage  facility  (e.g.,  loss  or  theft,  or  as  a  result  of  fire  or  explosion,  etc.)  that  may endanger human health or the environment.  Follow-up reports to AFSEC/SEW are only required when pertinent information, not previously reported, becomes known. Section 16F—Closure of Facilities Storing Waste Munitions 16.8.  Closure of Facilities Storing Waste Munitions Under CE. 16.8.1.  When  an  AE  storage  facility  storing  waste  military  munitions  under  CE  is permanently taken out of service for the storage of non-waste and waste military munitions, installations and responsible activities will ensure that such facilities are appropriately closed. (T-1). 16.8.2.  Installations  or  responsible  activities  must  notify  the  appropriate  Federal  or  State environmental regulatory authority in writing at least 45 days before closure activities begin.   (T-0).  Initiation of these closure procedures must occur within 180 days after the date the decision  is  made  to  permanently  stop  using  the  facility  for  the  storage  of  waste  military munitions. (T-0). 16.8.3.  Upon completion of closure activities, submit a “certification of closure,” signed by the installation or responsible activity Commander, or other equivalent level authority, and by an independent (i.e., an individual not assigned within the Commander’s or equivalent-level  authority’s  chain  of  command)  registered  professional  engineer  to  the  appropriate Federal or State environmental regulatory authority within 90 days of completing the closure activities, or by applicable law. (T-0). 402 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 16.8.4.  The certificate of closure must state, at a minimum, that each of the explosives safety requirements in Chapter 15 have been met and that waste military munitions and residues are removed in such a manner as to protect the public and the environment consistent with the planned use of the storage facility and of the property. (T-0). 16.8.5.  If  closure  certification  cannot  be  rendered,  the  installation  or  responsible  activity must contact the appropriate Federal and State environmental regulatory agency to determine the appropriate course of action. (T-0). 16.8.6.  Discontinuance  of Use for the Storage  of Waste Munitions.  When an AE storage facility storing waste military munitions under CE is permanently taken out of service for the storage of waste military munitions but is to continue in service for the storage of non-waste military  munitions,  installations  and  responsible  activities  will  ensure  that  waste  military munitions and residues are removed. (T-0). 16.8.7.  Closure of Facilities Storing Waste Military Munitions Under RCRA.  In addition to those  explosives  safety  requirements  in  Chapter  15,  closure  procedures  for  those  sites operating under existing RCRA permits follow those closure requirements stipulated in the respective permit. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 403 Chapter 17 UNEXPLODED ORDNANCE (UXO) Section 17A—Introduction 17.1.  Overview.  This  Chapter  establishes  standards  to  protect  personnel  and  property  from explosive and chemical agent (CA) hazards associated with UXO or other military munitions, to include DMM, that have experienced abnormal environments.  This Chapter’s standards do not apply during contingencies, combat operations, and military operations other than war; however, always  consider  these  explosives  safety  principles  in  such  circumstances  and  apply  as  the situation allows. 17.2.  General. 17.2.1.  UXO is considered the most dangerous  category of military munitions.  However, other military munitions, to include DMM, that are encountered outside the DoD’s munitions logistics  management  system,  particularly  those  that  have  experienced  an  abnormal environment, must be considered equally dangerous and managed as UXO until assessed and determined otherwise by EOD personnel, EOD-qualified U.S. Army Forces Command/20th Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion personnel and, when specifically authorized by the Air Force installation Commander, UXO-qualified personnel can make this determination for  MPPEH  programs,  range  residue  programs,  and  MR  activities  (See  Glossary  for definition  of  an  MR.)  (T-2,  DoDM  6055.09-M).    UXO-Qualified  Personnel  may  perform limited  explosives  operations  to  support  specific  range  clearance  objectives,  limited  to venting practice bombs or destroying spotting charges (T-1, DoDM 6055.09-M)..  Military munitions  that  have  experienced  abnormal  environments  include,  but  are  not  limited  to, munitions  remaining  after  attempted  demilitarization  by  open  burning  (OB)  or  open detonation  (OD);  munitions  involved  in  accidents  or  fires;  munitions  or  components subjected  to  certain  tests  (e.g.,  fuze  arming  tests,  jolt  and  jumble  tests)  that  might  cause arming. (U.S. Army Forces Command/20th Support Command/ 22nd Chemical Battalion are manned  with  specially  trained  personnel  that  provide  verification,  sampling,  detection, mitigation, RSP, decontamination, packaging, escort, and remediation of chemical, biological and industrial devices or hazardous materials). 17.2.1.1.  UXO  will  most  likely  be  found  in  areas  the  DoD  currently  uses  (e.g., operational ranges) or once used (e.g., former ranges) for military munitions training or testing.  For a variety of reasons, UXO may also be encountered in other areas, to include where contingency, combat, or military operations other than war have occurred. 17.2.1.2.  Munitions  that  may  have  experienced  an  abnormal  environment  might  be encountered in areas where an accident or incident involving military munitions occurred, in  areas  that  the  DoD  uses  or  once  used  for  open  detonation  of  excess,  obsolete,  or unserviceable military munitions, or in other areas. 17.2.2.  Positive identification of any potential explosive or CA hazards and consideration of the  potential  consequences  of  an  intentional  or  accidental  detonation  is  required  before disposition of any recovered munition.  This is essential for munitions that might contain CA that pose a potential downwind CA hazard.  Therefore, for both explosives and CA safety 404 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 reasons,  manage  munitions  found  outside  the  DoD’s  established  logistical  munitions management systems (e.g., UXO, DMM) until assessed, identified, and evaluated as to their explosive or CA hazards by EOD qualified personnel.  Also, manage munitions that contain an  unknown  liquid  fill  as  chemical  warfare  material  (CWM)  until  assessed,  and  the  fill determined. 17.2.2.1.  Only  EOD  personnel  and,  in  some  cases,  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command/20th Support Command/22nd Chemical Battalion personnel will respond to military or civilian authority requests for support to an explosives or munitions emergency. 17.2.2.2.  For responses that either involve recovered CWM (RCWM) or munitions that contain  an  unknown fill,  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command/20th  Support Command/22nd  Chemical  Battalion  personnel  and,  in  cases  where  the  munition’s physical characteristics allow positive identification, EOD personnel, are the only DoD personnel  authorized  to  determine  the  most  probable  fill  of  such  munitions.    The determination  as  to  whether  certain  munitions  contain  a  CA  fill  is  difficult,  if  not impossible, solely by visual inspection. liquid 17.2.2.2.1.  Many munitions have physical characteristics (e.g., shape, markings) that permit technically qualified personnel to rule out the potential for a CA fill (e.g., a U.S.-manufactured  4-inch  Stokes  mortar’s  physical  dimensions  clearly  indicate whether  it  contains  a  CA  or  explosive  fill).    However,  the  design  or  physical condition  of  some  munitions  may  not  allow  their  complete  identification  by  visual inspection.    This  is  especially  true  for  used  munitions  and  for  munitions  that  have either  experienced  abnormal  environments  or  been  exposed  to  the  elements  (e.g., buried or submerged) for an extended period. 17.2.2.2.2.  Munitions  whose  external  design  does  not  always  allow  positive  visual identification of their filler include, but may not be limited to: 4.2 inch mortars (M1, M2, and the M2A1 models) and Livens projectiles (MKII (M1) and MKIIAI models).  U.S.  Army  Forces  Command/20th  Support  Command/22nd  Chemical  Battalion personnel and, in some cases, EOD personnel, are the only DoD personnel authorized to determine the most probable fill of these munitions. 17.2.3.  Discovery of military munitions (e.g., UXO) outside the DoD’s munitions logistics management system might, in some circumstances, indicate that a munitions response (see Chapter  15)  or  other  protective  measures  are  warranted.    Installations  must  notify AFSEC/SEW, who will in-turn notify the Chairman, DDESB of: (T-1). 17.2.3.1.  Repetitive  explosives  or  munitions  emergency  responses  to  a  discrete geographic  area,  where  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  explosives  or  munitions emergency response are similar. 17.2.3.2.  A  single  explosives  or  munitions  emergency  response  that  involves  multiple military  munitions  (e.g.,  UXO,  DMM,  or  RCWM)  discovered  at  a  discrete  geographic area.    Such  discoveries  might  indicate  that  the  area  is  a  Formerly  Used  Defense  Site (FUDS). Section 17B—Disposition 17.3.  Disposition of UXO and of Other Military Munitions Being Managed as UXO. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 405 17.3.1.  The DoD is responsible for protecting people, property, and the environment from potential explosive hazards (e.g., blast and fragmentation) or CA hazards (e.g., nerve agents, mustard  gas)  associated  with  DoD-owned  UXO.    The  DoD  is  equally  responsible  for protecting personnel who respond to address such hazards. 17.3.2.  USAF will work collaboratively with environmental regulators  and safety officials toward resolving, in a mutually agreeable manner, any concerns with the planned disposition of  UXO  during  a  response  action;  however,  the  protection  of  people,  to  include  DoD response personnel, from the hazards associated with the discovered munition and with its disposition is paramount. 17.3.3.  There  are  no  safe  procedures  for  moving,  rendering  safe,  or  destroying  UXO,  but merely procedures considered less dangerous.  Destruction-in-place (also referred to as blow-in  place  (BIP))  is  the  least  dangerous;  therefore,  it  is  the  preferred  method  of  UXO destruction. 17.3.4.  DoD response actions to address UXO must comply with these standards and other applicable  DoD  policies  and  with  applicable  federal,  state,  interstate,  and  local  laws  and regulations, and any enforceable agreements.  Installations must ensure that, if not already in place,  protective  measures  (i.e.,  site  security)  are  implemented  as  quickly  as  practicable following  discovery  of  UXO  or  other  munitions  outside  the  DoD’s  munitions  logistics management  system.  (T-1).    Should  environmental  regulators  and  safety  officials  have concerns  regarding  the  sufficiency  of  the  protective  measures  to  be  taken,  raise  these concerns  to  the  AFSEC/SEW,  who  in-turn  notifies  the  Chairman,  DDESB  for  resolution.  Maintain protective measures throughout any delay caused by: 17.3.4.1.  Compliance with laws, regulations, and agreements. 17.3.4.2.  The  need  to  address  concerns  raised  by  environmental  regulators  and  safety officials about: 17.3.4.2.1.  Methods  for  managing  any  potential  adverse  impacts  (e.g.,  harming endangered  species,  damaging  cultural  resources)  of  implementing  a  pending  BIP operation. 17.3.4.2.2.  The use of alternative (to BIP) disposition methods. 17.3.4.3.  Other factors (e.g., weather). 17.3.5.  Military munitions known to contain CA or contain or are suspected to contain an unknown  liquid  fill  will  not  normally  be  destroyed  by  open  detonation  because  they  pose potential  downwind  CA  hazards.    The  responsible  DoD  Component  (normally  the Department of the Army), no lower than the Deputy Assistant Secretary level, may approve individual exceptions.  Approve such exceptions after discussions with appropriate elected representatives, environmental regulators, and safety officials from those communities that could potentially be impacted by the munition’s disposition (see paragraph 17.3.2.).  DoD Components  must  make  sure  that  protective  measures  to  ensure  explosives  safety  are maintained during any delay in disposition. (T-1). 17.3.6.  Do  not  move  UXO  unless  EOD  qualified  personnel  determine  that  the  risks associated  with  movement  are  acceptable.    (During  munitions  responses,  specifically authorized  UXO-qualified  personnel  may  make  this  determination  that  the  UXO  can  be 406 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 moved.  The definitions of MR is provided in the Glossary of this publication.  Specifically, an MR does not include activities normally conducted by EOD on active and inactive ranges or  energetic  disposal  procedures.    The  exception  to  this  rule  would  be  the  use  of  UXO-Qualified  personnel  (non-active  duty)  for  the  MPPEH  program  and  approved  RDT&E programs  per  paragraph  7.18.).    Although  environmental  regulators  and  safety  officials recognize the expertise of AF personnel involved in UXO disposition decisions, they may challenge an Air Force field expert’s decision and seek to elevate their concerns to higher levels of authority for resolution (see paragraphs 17.3.2. and  17.3.4.). 17.3.6.1.  If EOD qualified personnel determine that the risk associated with movement is unacceptable,  or  if  the  munition’s  condition  precludes  a  complete  assessment  beyond positive identification of any potential explosive hazard or determination that it does not present a CA hazard, then it must be BIP. 17.3.6.2.  In some circumstances, EOD personnel may determine that careful movement of a UXO, for a limited distance and using prescribed EOD procedures, is both necessary and allowed by EOD procedures.  In such circumstances, destruction by detonation will occur in the general vicinity of discovery. 17.3.7.  Under  some  circumstances,  when  BIP  does  not  pose  an  immediate,  certain,  and unacceptable  risk  to  people,  critical  operations,  facilities,  or  equipment,  environmental regulators  and  safety  officials  may  seek  collaboration  with  the  Air  Force  installation Commander  to  mutually  agree  to  mitigation  measures  to  reduce  potential  impacts  of  the pending  BIP  to  public  safety,  the  environment,  and  cultural  resources  (see  paragraphs 17.3.2. and  17.3.4.). 17.3.8.  When  BIP  poses  an  immediate,  certain,  and  unacceptable  risk  to  people,  critical operations,  facilities,  or  equipment,  EOD  personnel  may  determine  that  RSP  must  be attempted. 17.3.8.1.  Because  the  application  of  RSP  exposes  EOD  personnel  to  additional  risks (greater than BIP), only attempt the application of RSP in limited circumstances. 17.3.8.2.  Should  EOD  personnel  employ  RSP,  apply  protective  measures  to  mitigate potential explosive effects and, when necessary, a possible CA release. 17.3.8.3.  Only EOD personnel are authorized to conduct RSP. 17.3.8.4.  EOD personnel must perform RSP per Joint Service EOD Technical Data. (T-1). 17.3.8.4.1.  Raise  conflicts  between  this  Standard  and  the  Joint  Service  EOD Technical  Data  through  AFSEC/SEW  to  the  Chairman,  DDESB,  and  to  the  Joint EOD Program Board for resolution. 17.3.8.4.2.  When the condition of UXO (e.g., crushed, bent, broken, etc.) precludes strict adherence to published procedures, onsite  EOD personnel will determine and perform the procedure, established or innovative, that has the most probable degree of success  to  render  the  munitions  safe  while  mitigating  potential  explosive  or,  when necessary, CA effects. 17.3.9.  The onsite EOD supervisor, in the case of munitions responses, and the UXO safety officer ensures the detonation site is inspected after each detonation or any misfire.  Do not AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 407 allow anyone within the Minimum Separation Distance (MSD) from the detonation site until the onsite EOD supervisor or UXO safety officer declares the area safe. 17.3.10.  When  EOD  personnel  or,  in  the  case  of  munitions  responses,  authorized  UXO personnel, positively identify UXO as to its explosive hazard and determine it safe to dispose of by other than BIP or immediate destruction by detonation, either in the general vicinity of discovery or at a designated location  then the Air Force installation Commander, with the advice of EOD personnel, may evaluate a variety of safe disposition alternatives and options for  managing  any  potentially  adverse  impact  of  the  selected  disposition  alternative  (see paragraph 17.3.2.). Section 17C—Special Considerations 17.4.  General. 17.4.1.  Disassembly and Inerting Operations. 17.4.1.1.  Do  not  conduct  disassembly  and authorization. 17.4.1.2.  Contact  AFSEC/SEW  for  additional  guidance  on  disassembly  and  inerting operations. inerting  operations  without  proper 17.4.2.  Construction Support. 17.4.2.1.  Construction support may be required during intrusive activities (e.g., laying or repairing utilities, improving roads) on property known or suspected to contain UXO or DMM. installation  Commander  or  designated 17.4.2.2.  The  responsible  authority  (e.g., representative) determines the level of construction support required on  a case-by-case basis.    Construction  support  is  determined  by  the  probability  of  encountering  UXO  or DMM. 17.4.2.2.1.  Low  Probability.    EOD  personnel  or  UXO-qualified  personnel  must  be contacted to ensure they are available, advised about the project, and placed “on call” to assist if suspected UXO are encountered during construction.  Discoveries of UXO or DMM on such sites require reassessment of the level of support required. 17.4.2.2.1.1.  A “low” determination may only be assigned to those areas where a search of available historical records and onsite investigation data indicates that, given  the  military  or  munitions-related  activities  that  occurred  at  the  site,  the likelihood that UXO or other MEC are present is low. 17.4.2.2.1.2.  Munitions-related  activities  that  may  merit  a  “low”  determination include, but are not limited to, the use of the area: for live-fire training exclusively with small arms ammunition; for maneuver training, to include maneuver training involving  the  use  of  smokes,  pyrotechnics,  and  simulators;  as  firing  points;  for munitions inspection, handling, storage, or transfers, to include residue points and inert  storage  yards;  for  air  defense;  or  as  munitions  operating  facilities,  the exceptions  being  facilities  where  the  processes  used  might  have  resulted  in  the generation of concentrations of munitions constituents high enough to present an 408 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 explosive hazard.  Areas where a previous response has been completed, pursuant to  a  DDESB-approved  MRESS,  for  the  stipulated  reuse  also  qualify  for  “low” determinations. 17.4.2.2.2.  Moderate to High Probability.  EOD personnel must attempt to identify and remove any explosive or CA hazards in the construction footprint prior to any intrusive construction activities. 17.4.2.2.2.1.  Assign a “moderate to high” determination to those areas where a search  of  available  historical  records  or  onsite  investigation  data  indicates  that, given the military or munitions-related activities that occurred at the site, there is more than a low probability that UXO or other MEC are present. 17.4.2.2.2.2.  Munitions-related  activities  that  may  merit  a  “moderate  to  high” determination  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  use  of  the  area:  for  live-fire training  other  than  exclusively  with  small  arms  ammunition  (e.g.,  munitions containing HE projectiles); as operational range impact areas; for OB or OD of excess,  obsolete,  or  unserviceable  munitions;  as  munitions  operating  facilities where processes used might have resulted in the generation of concentrations of munitions constituents high enough to present an explosive hazard; for munitions burial; or for any activities involving possible disposition of CWM. 17.4.3.  Anomaly Avoidance.  Employ anomaly avoidance techniques on properties known or  suspected  to  contain  UXO  or  DMM  to  avoid  surface  UXO  and,  when  necessary, subsurface anomalies. 17.4.3.1.  When anomaly avoidance is used during training (e.g., maneuver training, live-fire  training),  testing,  or  operational  range  management  activities  conducted  on  such properties, the Commander responsible for such activities ensures: (T-1). 17.4.3.1.1.  A  risk  assessment  to  evaluate  the  potential  hazards  associated  with  the proposed activities is completed and methods to mitigate any potential exposures are implemented. 17.4.3.1.2.  Training in anomaly avoidance, explosives safety and, when appropriate, CA  safety  training  is  provided  to  all  personnel  involved  in  the  training,  testing,  or operational range management activities that access property known or suspected to contain UXO or DMM. 17.4.3.2.  When anomaly avoidance is used during other than training or testing activities, or during activities involving other than operational range management activities: 17.4.3.2.1.  Avoid  surface  UXO  during  any  activities  that  require  entry  to  the  area (e.g., conducting cultural resource studies). 17.4.3.2.2.  Avoid surface UXO and subsurface anomalies during any intrusive work (e.g., drilling environmental monitoring wells). 17.4.3.2.3.  Provide  escort  support  by  EOD  personnel,  or  within  areas  known  or suspected to contain UXO, excluding CA, regardless of configuration, by: 17.4.3.2.3.1.  UXO-qualified personnel. 17.4.3.2.3.2.  UXO  Technician  I  personnel  under  the  supervision  of  UXO AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 409 qualified  personnel.  The  responsible  Commander  or  authority  may,  based  on  a risk  assessment  and  implementation  of  methods  to  mitigate  any  potential exposures, approve UXO Technician I personnel to perform escort duties without supervision. 17.4.3.2.3.3.  UXO  qualified  personnel  trained  in  CWM  responses  within  areas known or suspected to contain CA, regardless of configuration, to include areas where such CA is commingled with other UXO. 17.4.3.2.4.  During  anomaly  avoidance  all  UXO,  surface  and  subsurface,  must  be avoided and their locations noted and reported to appropriate authorities.  In addition, subsurface anomalies must not be investigated. Section 17D—Access to UXO Areas 17.5.  Access to Areas Known or Suspected to Contain UXO.  To ensure explosives and CA safety  risk  is  identified  and  controlled  on  real  property  currently  or  formerly  under  the jurisdiction, custody, or control of USAF, the Air Force installation Commander must: (T-1). 17.5.1.  Prohibit  unnecessary  access  (e.g.,  livestock  grazing;  recreational  uses,  such  as hunting and hiking) and take appropriate action to deter unauthorized access to areas under Air Force control that are known or suspected to contain UXO or other munitions that have experienced abnormal environments. 17.5.1.1.  Limit  access  to  such  areas,  particularly  operational  range  impact  areas,  to personnel  who  have  an  operational  requirement  to  enter  such  areas  (e.g.,  range maintenance,  environmental  monitoring,  and  security).    Complete  a  risk  assessment  to evaluate  the  potential  hazards  associated  with  the  proposed  activity  and  implement methods to mitigate any potential exposures before allowing access. 17.5.1.2.  Actions to prohibit or deter access may include:  establishing access controls (e.g.,  fencing  the  area,  establishing  roving  security  patrols)  and  providing  public notifications  of  any  potential  hazards  (e.g.,  posting  UXO  hazard  warning  signs, conducting  UXO  safety  education  programs).    Also,  when  used,  signs  must  be  legible and, when appropriate, multi-lingual or as pictograms. (T-1). 17.5.2.  When  the  USAF  does  not  control  the  area  (e.g.,  FUDS),  at  a  minimum,  provide written  notification  to  the  property  owner  and,  if  known,  any  tenants  of  the  potential explosive  and  CA  hazards  present.    Maintain  a  record  of  this  notification  in  permanent records. 17.5.3.  Assume the following areas contain UXO or other munitions that have experienced abnormal environments: 17.5.3.1.  Operational range impact areas, to include their associated safety zones (e.g., caution area, safety buffer zone).  Exceptions include, but are not limited to, ranges used exclusively for training with small arms ammunition. 17.5.3.2.  Ranges  (sites)  used  for  OB  or  OD  of  excess,  obsolete,  or  unserviceable munitions. 410 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 17.5.3.3.  Former impact areas and former OB or OD sites, unless documentation exists to  show  that  they  were  adequately  cleared  during  range  closure  or  that  an  appropriate munitions  response  has  been  completed.    In  some  cases,  because  these  former  impact areas  or  former  OB  or  OD  sites  may  have  transferred  from  USAF  control,  the  AF’s ability to restrict access may be limited or nonexistent.  In such cases, the USAF must, at a minimum, ensure: (T-1). 17.5.3.3.1.  The  property  owner  is  provided  written  notification  of  the  potential explosives  and  CA  hazards  and  the  risks  inherent  in  any  use  of  property  that  is inconsistent with those hazards. 17.5.3.3.2.  A  public  UXO  safety  education  program  is  implemented,  when appropriate. 17.5.4.  On  USAF  property,  prohibit  construction  in  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain UXO or DMM without required: (T-1). 17.5.4.1.  Construction or UXO avoidance support (see paragraphs 17.4.2. or  17.4.3.). 17.5.4.2.  Approved MRESS, MRCSS, or site plan for munitions responses (see Chapter 15). 17.5.5.  Provide, or in the case of owners or tenants of non-USAF controlled property, offer explosives  safety  and,  when  appropriate,  CA  safety  training  to  all  individuals  authorized access to USAF property known or suspected to contain UXO. 17.5.6.  Develop guidelines to determine when individuals, who for operational reasons (e.g., environmental  monitoring),  are  authorized  access  to  areas  under  USAF  control  that  are known  or  suspected  to  contain  UXO,  must  be  escorted  into  the  area  IAW  paragraphs 17.4.3.2.3. (T-1). 17.5.7.  Establish  UXO  safety  education  programs  to  educate  USAF  personnel,  their dependents,  and  private  citizens  that  live  near  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain  UXO about explosive hazards and, when appropriate, CA hazards associated with UXO, and with the risks associated with trespassing on operational ranges or with entering areas known or suspected to contain UXO. 17.5.8.  Prior  to  changing  the  use  of  a  property  known  or  suspected  to  contain  UXO  or munitions that have experienced abnormal environments to a use that is incompatible with their presence: 17.5.8.1.  For  operational  ranges,  perform  an  appropriate  range  clearance,  whether changing  to  a  similar  (e.g.,  converting  an  impact  area  to  a  hand  grenade  range)  or dissimilar use (e.g., changing a range to a maneuver area). 17.5.8.2.  For  areas  on  USAF  property,  other  than  operational  ranges,  perform  an appropriate munitions response. 17.5.8.3.  For property not under USAF control, upon learning of a proposed change in use  or  pertinent  munitions  response  action,  offer  to  engage  in  munitions  response activities  only  to  the  extent  necessary  to  ensure  planned  response  actions  afford protectiveness from an explosives and CA safety perspective.  The USAF engagement in such munitions response activities may be limited to explosives safety experts providing AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 411 basic guidance and advice during applicable deliberations, decision making, and approval activities  unless  additional  DoD  services  are  arranged through  contractual  or reimbursement mechanisms between USAF and other responsible parties. Section 17E—Identification and Control 17.6.  Identification  and  Control.  To  ensure  explosives  and  CA  safety  risk  is  identified  and controlled on real property currently or formerly under the jurisdiction, custody, or control of the USAF,  Installation  Commanders  must  create  and  maintain  permanent  records  required  by paragraph 15.2.2. (T-1).  When an operational range is closed or an installation is deactivated, the  Installation  Commander  must  designate  the  office  to  transfer  these  records  to  ensure  their permanent retention. (T-1). 17.7.  Minimum Separation Distance (MSD) for UXO. 17.7.1.  The MSD for intentional detonations, which may be reduced if supported by a hazard assessment  or  when  using  approved  engineering  controls  listed  in  EOD  publications  (for explosives  or  munitions  emergency  responses)  or  other  DDESB  approved  engineering controls (for munitions responses), is the greatest distance of: 17.7.1.1.  Blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D = 328W1/3. 17.7.1.2.  The calculated MFD. 17.7.1.3.  The appropriate downwind hazard distance for CA (see Chapter 15). 17.7.2.  The  MSD  for  unintentional  detonations,  which  may  be  reduced  if  supported  by  a hazard  assessment  or  when  approved  engineering  controls  listed  in  EOD  publications  (for explosives  or  munitions  emergency  responses)  or  other  DDESB  approved  engineering controls (for munitions responses), is the greatest distance of: 17.7.2.1.  Blast overpressure, as computed by using the formula: D = 40W1/3. 17.7.2.2.  The calculated MFD. 17.7.2.3.  The appropriate downwind hazard distance for CA (see Chapter 15). Note: Use lesser distances if supported by a hazard assessment; however, in no case will the distance be less than the HFD; the exception is when approved engineering controls are used. 17.7.2.4.  Team Separation Distance (TSD).  The greatest distance of: 17.7.2.4.1.  Blast overpressure, as computed by the formula: D = 40W1/3. 17.7.2.4.2.  The appropriate downwind hazard distance for CA. Section 17F—Other Considerations 17.8.  General. 17.8.1.  Transportation.  All transportation must comply with the requirements of applicable federal,  state,  interstate,  and  local  laws,  and  all  implementing  regulations  relating  to transportation  of  solid  waste,  hazardous  substances,  hazardous  materials,  and  toxic substances. (T-1). 412 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 17.8.1.1.  UXO.    Before  UXO  that  may  pose  an  explosive  or  CA  hazard  may  be transported or shipped over public transportation routes, EOD personnel must determine whether the UXO is safe for transport. (T-1).  Document determinations that the UXO is safe  for  transport  in  the  EOD  incident  report.    A  copy  of  the  incident  report  must accompany the shipment. (T-1). 17.8.1.2.  RCWM.    Before  RCWM  may  be  transported  or  shipped,  the  Army  Material Assessment Review Board assesses it as safe for transport and packaged in an over-pack container  specifically  designed  and  approved  by  the  Army  and  by  the  DOT  for  the transport of RCWM (see paragraph 15.5.9.9.1.2.).  In addition, the specific notifications and concurrences required in 50 U.S.C. § 1512 must be met. (T-1). 17.8.2.  Firefighting  Involving  Areas  Known  or  Suspected  to  Contain  UXO  or  DMM  (see Chapter 10). 17.8.2.1.  Advanced planning is essential for firefighting operations involving areas that are known or suspected to contain UXO or DMM or CA hazards.  Coordination of such plans between firefighters and explosives safety personnel or EOD personnel and, when appropriate, CA safety professionals, is essential. 17.8.2.2.  Senior  firefighting  personnel  must  carefully  assess  whether  to  fight  a  fire involving areas that are known or suspected to contain explosive or CA hazards. (T-1).  Factors to consider include, but are not limited, to: the types of munitions that might be present; the safety of firefighting personnel and of the public; the potential loss of critical assets; and the duration and intensity of the fire. 17.8.2.2.1.  When the decision is made not to fight such fires, evacuate the area and remain so until it has cooled for at least 24 hours (see paragraph 10.10.). 17.8.2.2.2.  When  the  decision  is  made  to  fight  such  fires,  provide  all  firefighters involved in fighting the fire basic safety training for fighting fires involving military munitions. 17.8.3.  Controlled Burns. 17.8.3.1.  Permit  burning  of  vegetation  to  facilitate  safe  UXO  clearance  or  removal operations,  provided  proper  safeguards  are  in  place  to  protect  all  personnel  from unintentional detonations.  Carefully plan and execute these burns to manage explosives safety  risks  and  environmental  effects.    During  such  burning  operations,  all  personnel must be at MFD from the burning or burned area, based on the munition with the greatest fragment distance, and remain out of the area until it has cooled for at least 24 hours. (T-1). 17.8.3.2.  Do not perform controlled burns on areas known or suspected to contain CWM. (T-1). 17.8.4.  Technology. 17.8.4.1.  Explosives  safety  is  a  paramount  consideration  when  determining  the  most appropriate technologies to be used to detect, excavate, remove, and dispose of UXO and other munitions that present an explosive hazard. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 413 17.8.4.2.  Consider the use of remotely operated equipment (e.g., excavators, sifters, and shredders) or other standoff technologies (e.g., lasers) that may offer the safest approach for excavating and destroying UXO. 17.8.4.3.  Paragraph 15.5.8.3.5.  addresses mechanized UXO processing operations.  ANDREW M.

Area WSM—Weapons Safety Manager WST—Weapons Safety Tool WSV—Weapons Storage Vault Terms Aboveground Magazine (AGM)—Any building or structure, except an operating building, used for  the  storage  of  explosives.    Magazines  are  of  two  general  types:  igloo  (earth-covered)  and aboveground (no earth covering).  An aboveground magazine is any structure or facility, without sufficient  earth  covering,  used  for  the  storage  of  explosives.    For  igloo  see  “Earth-covered Magazine”.  Also includes open air munitions stocks, trucks, trailers, railcars or cargo aircraft loaded with explosives. Aboveground Structure/Site (AGS)—Any aboveground, non-earth-covered structure/site. Acceptor/Donor—A total quantity of stored AE may be subdivided into separate storage units in order to  reduce the  MCE.  The separation distances between distinct storage units, with or without  an  intervening  barrier,  need  to  be  sufficient  (i.e.,  IMD)  to  ensure  that  propagation between  units  does  not  occur.    The  storage  unit  that  reacts  initially  is  termed  the  donor  and nearby units, which may be endangered, are termed acceptors. Active Installation—A military installation that is currently in service and being regularly used for military activities. 432 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Administration Area—The area containing administrative buildings that support the installation as a whole, excluding those offices located near and directly serving AE storage and operating areas. AE Aircraft Cargo Area—Any area specifically designated for, aircraft loading or unloading of transportation configured AE or parking aircraft loaded with transportation configured AE. AE Area—An area specifically designated and set aside from other portions of an installation for the development, manufacture, testing, maintenance, storage, or handling of AE. AE Facility—Any structure or location containing AE. Aircraft  Battle  Damage  Repair  Sites—These  are  sites  where  battle  damage  is  simulated  on aircraft hulls by detonating up to two ounces of explosives packed inside a length of steel pipe. Aircraft  Explosives  Cargo  Parking  Area—Any  area,  commonly  called  a  hot  cargo  pad, specifically  designated  for  parking  aircraft  loaded  with  transportation-configured  explosives cargo, or those being loaded, unloaded, or awaiting loading. Aircraft Passenger Transport Operations—Passenger transport operations are defined for the purposes  of  QD  as  follows:    Passenger  transport  traffic  involving  military  dependents  and civilians other than those employed by or working directly for DoD Components.  The following are not considered passenger transport operations:  1) Infrequent flights of base and command administrative aircraft that may, on occasion, provide some space available travel to authorized personnel.    2)  Travel  of  direct  hire  appropriated  funds  personnel  employed  by  any  DoD Component.  3) Travel of such personnel as contractor and technical representatives traveling to or from direct support assignments at DoD installations. Ammunition—Generic term related mainly to articles of military application consisting of all kinds of bombs, grenades, rockets, mines, projectiles, and other similar devices or contrivances.

However,  metallic  building structural members (e.g., steel I-beams) can also function as conductors. Confined  by  Ground  Surface  (CBGS)—This is a failure mode of a liquid propellant launch vehicle that does include impact velocities of the liquid propellant tankage (i.e., fallback onto the pad immediately after liftoff).  Propellant mixing occurs as well as ignition. Confined by Missile (CBM)—This is a failure mode of a fueled liquid propellant launch vehicle on a launch pad where an interior bulkhead failure occurs allowing the two propellants to come into contact.  Ignition occurs, but there is effectively no impact velocity associated with mixing of the two propellants.

The purpose of a definitive drawing is to provide a standard design to insure  consistency  in  construction.    Upon  approval  by  the  DDESB,  there  is  no  need  for  the definitive drawing to be reviewed again, provided the design has not been changed. Deflagration  Reaction—Ignition and rapid burning of the confined energetic materials builds up high local pressures leading to nonviolent pressure release as a result of a low strength case or venting through case closures (e.g., loading ports or fuze wells).  The case might rupture but does not fragment; closure covers might be expelled, and unburned and burning energetic materials might  be  thrown  about  and  spread  the  fire.    Propulsion  might  launch  an  unsecured  test  item, causing an additional hazard.  No blast or significant fragmentation damage to the surroundings is expected, only heat and smoke damage from the burning explosive substances. Demilitarization—To mutilate, disarm, or accomplish any other action required to prevent the further use of equipment and materiel for its original intended military or lethal purpose. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 437 Designated Aircraft Parking Area—An aircraft parking area meeting airfield parking criteria.

Electric  Power  House—An electric power generation facility that provides prime or stand-by auxiliary  electrical  power  where  no  commercial  power  is  available  to  meet  operational requirements.  Also called an electric power plant.  A powerhouse can contain generators, fuel storage and supply, switch gear, and transformers (if required).  Powerhouses supplying primary power to an installation or group of facilities are normally staffed.  Power plants supplying only stand-by auxiliary power to individual facilities are usually unoccupied. Electric  Substations—The point of supply for a base electrical distribution system or portion thereof.    The  main  substation  is  usually  the  dividing  point  between  government  facilities  and those of a utility company.  A substation subdivides the power supply and contains protective and  control  devices  for  the  incoming  supply  circuit,  transformers  (when  required),  voltage regulators,  and  indicating  or  recording  instruments.    A  substation  that  has  no  transformers  is sometimes called a switching station.

Electrically Initiated Device (EID)—An EID is a single unit, device, or subassembly that uses electrical  energy  to  produce  an  explosive,  pyrotechnic,  thermal,  or  mechanical  output  (e.g., electro  explosive  devices  (such  as  hot  bridge  wire,  semiconductor  bridge,  carbon  bridge,  and conductive composition), exploding foil initiators, laser initiators, burn wires, and fusible links).  (MIL-HDBK-240) Electromagnetic  Environment  (EME)—The  resulting  product  of  the  power  and  time distribution, in various frequency ranges, of the radiated or conducted electromagnetic emission levels encountered by a military force, system, or platform when performing its assigned mission in  its  intended  operational  environment.      It  is  the  totality  of  electromagnetic  energy,  from manmade  and  natural  sources,  where  a  platform/system,  or  subsystem/equipment  will  be exposed  within  any  domain,  that  is,  land,  air,  space,  and  sea,  while  performing  its  intended mission throughout its operational life cycle (in the case of munitions, during its stockpile-to-safe separation sequence).  When defined, the EME will be for a particular time and place. Specific equipment  characteristics,  such  as  operating  frequencies,  emitter  power  levels,  and  receiver sensitivity,  operational  factors  such  as  distances  between  items  and  force  structure,  and frequency  coordination  all  contribute  to  the  EME.    In  addition,  transient  emissions  and  their associated rise and fall times such as from EMP, lightning, and p-static also contribute. (JP 3-13.1 and MIL-HDBK-237) Electromagnetic  Environmental  Effects  (E3)—E3  is  the  impact  of  the  EME  upon  the operational capability of military forces, equipment, systems, and platforms.

(JP 1-02, DoD Dictionary) Emergency  Withdrawal  Distance—Distance  to  which  personnel  are  removed  from  an  ES during an explosive accident or incident. Emission Control (EMCON)—The selective and controlled use of electromagnetic, acoustic, or other  emitters  to  optimize  command  and  control  capabilities  while  minimizing,  for  operations security detection by enemy sensors, mutual interference among friendly systems; and/or enemy interference with the ability to execute a military deception plan.  (JP 1-02, DoD Dictionary) Enduring Location—(Main Operating Bases) DOD use and established lexicon for the types of overseas (in foreign countries or US territories overseas) locations from which it operates in its global  defense  posture  framework.    A  location  is  enduring  when  the  Department  intends  to maintain access and or use of that location for the foreseeable future.  Enduring locations play a critical role in allowing the Department to surge, deploy, or employ U.S. forces when and where necessary,  but  need  not  have  a  continuous  presence  or  permanent  structure  sustained  or constructed  through  U.S.  appropriations.    Combatant  Commanders  nominate  locations  as enduring and OSD validates these nominations in consultation with the State Department.  The following types of sites are considered enduring for U.S. Government purposes: Main Operating Bases (MOB), Forward  Operating Site (FOS), and Cooperative Security  Location (CSL).  All three types of locations may be composed of more than one distinct site. Energetic Liquid—A liquid, slurry, or gel, consisting of, or containing an explosive, oxidizer, fuel, or combination of the above, that may undergo, contribute to, or cause rapid exothermic decomposition, deflagration or detonation. Energetic  Materials—Energetic  materials  are  chemical  compounds,  or  mixtures  of  chemical compounds,  that  are  divided  into  three  groups  according  to  use:  explosives,  propellants,  and pyrotechnics.  Explosives and propellants that have been properly initiated evolve large volumes of  hot  gas  in  a  short  time.    The  difference  between  explosives  and  propellants  is  the  rate  the reaction  proceeds.    In  explosives,  a  fast  reaction  produces  a  very  high  pressure  shock  in  the surrounding  medium.    This  shock  is  capable  of  shattering  objects.    In  propellants,  a  slower reaction produces a lower pressure over a longer period of time.  This lower sustained pressure is used  to  propel  objects.    Pyrotechnics  evolve  large  amounts  of  heat  but  much  less  gas  than propellants or explosives.  Various external stimuli can cause release of the energy contained in energetic materials.  Knowing the response of individual energetic materials to specific stimuli is important  from  the  point  of  view  of  safety.  Energetic  materials  are  sensitive  to  four  external stimuli.  These are: impact, shock, electrostatic, and thermal.  Eliminating or controlling these stimuli is key to eliminating the unintentional initiation of energetic material.  The focus of this Manual  is  on  these  four  areas.    The  hazards  associated  with  energetic  material  are  blast, fragments, mass fire, fire and toxicity. Engineering  Controls—Management  of  facility  operations  through  the  use  of  engineering principles  (e.g.,  facility  design,  operation  sequencing,  equipment  selection,  or  process limitations). En  Route  Infrastructure—The  fundamental  structures  and  systems  required  for  the employment of both organic and commercial strategic lift capacity. 440 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Entry  Control  Point  (ECP)—A  location  or  facility  used  to  control  pedestrian  or  vehicular access  to  controlled  or  restricted  areas.

Environmental  Regulators  and  Safety  Officials—Includes,  but  may  not  be  limited  to, environmental  regulators,  environmental  coordinators,  or  hazardous  material  coordinators,  law enforcement officers, and safety personnel of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, State, interstate,  and  local  governments  (which  may  include  Federally  recognized  Indians  tribes  and Alaska  Native  entities),  and  other  Federal  land  managers.    When  appropriate,  public  health officials of various agencies may also be involved. Essential Personnel—Individuals necessary for the safe and effective completion of a specific explosives operation. Evaluation Zone—The area around an ES where the PESs, if filled to maximum capacity, could violate QD to that ES.  (Remember, a PES is also an ES).  This zone determines the PESs that must be listed on the AF Form 943 for evaluation. Exception—The  inclusive  term  for  any  departure  from  the  requirements  of  this  Manual.  Exceptions  are  further  divided  into  deviations,  event  waivers,  waivers,  exemptions,  and Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF) waivers and exemptions for new construction. Exemption—A relatively long-term departure from a mandatory requirement of QD standards of this regulation.  See definition of “waiver”.

Expansion  Chamber—A  protective  construction  feature  in  an  underground  storage  facility designed  to  reduce  the  overpressure  exiting  the  facility  by  increasing  the  total  volume  of  the tunnel  chamber  complex.    It  may  also  function  as  an  operating  area  within  the  underground facility or as a debris trap. Explosion Proof—Used in referring to electrical equipment; specifically, to equipment enclosed in a case that can withstand an internal burning or explosion of elements inside the case, and can prevent  ignition  by  spark,  flash,  or  explosion  of  any  outside  gas  or  vapor  surrounding  the enclosure. Explosion Reaction—Ignition and rapid burning of the confined energetic materials builds up high local pressures leading to breakup of the confining structure.  Metal cases are fragmented (e.g.,  brittle  fracture)  into  large  pieces  that  are  often  thrown  long  distances.    Unreacted  or burning  energetic  materials  are  also  thrown  about.    Fire  and  smoke  hazards  will  exist.    Air shocks are produced that can cause damage to nearby structures.  The blast and high velocity fragments  can  cause  minor  ground  craters  and  damage  (e.g.,  breakup,  tearing,  gouging)  to adjacent metal plates.  Blast pressures are lower than for a detonation reaction. Explosive—A  substance  or  a  mixture  of  substances  that  is  capable  by  chemical  reaction  of producing gas at such temperature, pressure and speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.  The term explosive includes all substances variously known as HE and propellants, together with igniter,  primer,  initiation,  and  pyrotechnic  (e.g.,  illuminant,  smoke,  delay,  decoy,  flare  and incendiary compositions. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 441 Explosive  Accident—Accidents  resulting  in  damage  or  injury  from:    1)  An  explosion  or functioning of explosive materials or devices (except as a result of enemy action).  2) Inadvertent actuation, jettisoning, and releasing or launching explosive devices.  3)  Impacts of ordnance off-range.

Explosives  Safety  Distance  (Quantity-Distance)—An  expression  of  the  quantity  versus distance  principle  involved,  or  the  toxic  hazard  distance  used  in  determining  acceptable separations  between  given  explosives  sources  and  given  exposures  to  the  hazard.    For  the purposes of this regulation, the term "Quantity-Distance" or "QD" will be used (see "quantity-distance"). Explosives Safety Management—A cost-effective RM process, including policies, procedures, standards, engineering, and resources, that addresses potential probabilities and consequences of mishaps  involving  DoD  military  munitions  or  other  encumbering  explosives  or  munitions,  to sustain  operational  capabilities  and  readiness  and  to  protect  people,  property,  and  the environment. Explosives  Safety  Munitions  Risk  Management  (ESMRM)—A  systematic  approach  that integrates  risk  analysis  into  operational  planning,  military  training  exercises,  and  contingency operations  with  the  goal  of  identifying  potentially  adverse  consequences  associated  with munitions operations, risk reduction alternatives, and risk acceptance criteria for senior officials to make the risk decision. Explosives Safety Submission (ESS)—See Munitions Response ESS (MRESS). Explosives Site Plan (ESP)—May also be referred to as a QD Safety Submission (QDSS)—Package  consisting  of  all  information  necessary  to  assess  compliance  with  explosives  safety standards  (especially  QD  standards)  for  explosives  storage  or  operating  location.    Once approved,  this  package  identifies  storage  and  operational  limitations,  and  provides  a  tool  for management of risks associated with the storage or operating location.  Note:  An ESP can also be prepared for a non-explosives exposed site. Explosives Sited CAPA—An aircraft parking area meeting both explosives safety and airfield criteria. Explosives Storage Area—A designated area of explosives-containing facilities set aside for the exclusive storage or "warehousing" of explosives stocks.

Lightning current flows on the exterior of the structure, not through its interior. Faraday-Like Shield—A LPS that is not an ideal Faraday Cage, but is formed by a contiguous conductive matrix that is properly bonded and grounded (e.g., electrically continuous steel arches and reinforcing bars of concrete end-walls and floors of steel arch magazines, reinforcing bars of ECM, or the metal shell of pre-fabricated "portable" magazines and metal buildings). Field Office—See "explosives operations office." Firebrand—A burning or hot projection that may transfer thermal energy to the surroundings. Firebreaks—An area free of all readily combustible material, such as dry grass, leaves, brush or dead wood.

Mass  Detonating  Explosives—HE,  black  powder,  certain  propellants  and  pyrotechnics,  and other similar explosives.  They may be alone or in combination, or loaded into various types of ammunition or containers.  Most of the entire quantity can explode instantaneously when a small portion is subjected to fire, to severe concussion or impact, to the impulse of an initiating agent, 450 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 that  affects  almost the  entire  quantity  of  AE  virtually or to the effect of a considerable discharge of external energy.  Such an explosion will generally cause severe structural damage to adjacent objects.  The explosion may cause detonation of other items of AE stored near enough to (and not adequately protected from) the initially exploding pile, so that the two or more quantities must be considered as one for QD purposes. Mass  Explosion—Explosion instantaneously. Mast  LPS—An  LPS  that  consists  of  one  or  more  poles  with  a  strike  termination  device connected to an earth electrode system by down conductors.  Its purpose is to intercept lightning flashes and provide a zone of protection.

(JP 4-01.5) Material  Potentially  Presenting  an  Explosive  Hazard  (MPPEH)—Material  owned  or controlled  by  the  DoD  that,  prior  to  determination  of  its  explosives  safety  status,  potentially contains explosives or munitions (e.g., munitions containers and packaging material; munitions debris remaining after munitions use, demilitarization, or disposal; and range-related debris) or potentially  contains  a  high  enough  concentration  of  explosives  that  the  material  presents  an explosive hazard (e.g., equipment, drainage systems, holding tanks, piping, or ventilation ducts that  were  associated  with  munitions  production,  demilitarization,  or  disposal  operations).  Excluded  from  MPPEH  are:    Military  munitions  and  military  munitions-related  materials, including wholly inert components (e.g., fins, launch tubes, containers, packaging material), that are to be used or reused for their intended purpose and are within a DoD Component-established munitions management  system.   Non-munitions-related material  (e.g., horseshoes,  rebar, other solid  objects),  munitions  related  solid  metal  fragments  that  do  not  realistically  present  an explosive  hazard.    Other  items  that  may  present  explosion  hazards  (e.g.,  gasoline  cans, compressed gas cylinders) that are not munitions and are not intended for use as munitions. Maximum  Credible  Event  (MCE)—In  hazards  evaluation,  the  MCE  from  a  hypothesized accidental explosion, fire, or toxic chemical agent release (with explosives contribution) is the worst single event that is likely to occur from a given quantity and disposition of AE.  The event must  be  realistic  with  a  reasonable  probability  of  occurrence  considering  the  explosion propagation,  burning  rate  characteristics,  and  physical  protection  given  to  the  items  involved.  The  MCE  evaluated  on  this  basis  may  then  be  used  as  a  basis  for  effects  calculations  and casualty predictions. Maximum Fragment Distance—The calculated maximum distance where a fragment from the cylindrical portion of an AE case is expected to be thrown by the design mode detonation of a single item.  This distance does not address fragments produced be sections of nose plugs, base plates, boattails, and/or lugs.  These special fragments, from the non-cylindrical portions of the AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 451 AE  case,  can  travel  to  significantly  greater  distances  (i.e.,  >10,000  feet)  than  the  calculated maximum distances.

Military Munitions—All ammunition products and components produced or used by or for the U.S.  DoD  or  the  U.S.  Armed  Services  for  national  defense  and  security,  including  military munitions under the control of the DoD, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. DOE, and the National Guard  personnel.    The  term  “military  munitions”  includes  confined  gaseous,  liquid,  and  solid propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics, chemical and riot control agents, smokes, and incendiaries used by the DoD Components, including bulk explosives and chemical warfare agents, chemical munitions,  rockets,  guided  and  ballistic  missiles,  bombs,  warheads,  mortar  rounds,  artillery ammunition,  small  arms  ammunition,  grenades,  mines,  torpedoes,  depth  charges,  cluster munitions and dispensers, demolition charges, and devices and components thereof.  “Military munitions” do not include wholly inert items, IEDs, and nuclear weapons, nuclear devices, and nuclear components thereof.  However, that term does include nonnuclear components of nuclear devices,  managed  under  the  DoE's  nuclear  weapons  program,  after  all  required  sanitizing operations under the “Atomic Energy Act of 1954,” as amended, have been completed (40 CFR Part 260.10, reference (am)). Military  Munitions  Response  Program  (MMRP)—A  DoD  developed  program  in  2001  to address  munitions-related  concerns,  including  explosive  safety,  environmental,  and  health hazards from releases of UXO, discarded military munitions (DDM), and munitions constituents (MC)  found  at  locations  other  than  operational  ranges  on  active  and  Base  Realignment  and Closure (BRAC) installations and Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS).  The MMRP addresses non-operational range lands with suspected or known hazards from munitions and explosives of concern  (MEC)  occurring  prior  to  September  2002,  but  are  not  already  included  with  an Installation Response Program (IRP) site cleanup activity.

Munitions Response—Response actions, including investigation, removal actions, and remedial actions  to  address  the  explosives  safety,  human  health,  or  environmental  risks  presented  by UXO,  DMM,  or  MC,  or  to  support  a  determination  that  no  removal  or  remedial  action  is required.    Munitions  response  actions/activities  are  those  actions  conducted  on  munitions response  areas  (MRA),  and  munitions  response  sites  (MRS),  or  formerly  used  defense  sites (FUDS) per 32 CFR Part 179, Munitions Response Site Prioritization Protocol (MRSPP). Munitions Response Chemical Safety Submission (MRCSS)—An MRCSS (also referred to as a  chemical  safety  submission  or  CSS)  that  addresses  the  potential  effects  of  an  inadvertent release  of  chemical  agent  from  a  chemical  munition  or  from  a  configuration  that  is  not  a munition during munitions response activities (e.g., intrusive field work).  In addition, involves either the intentional physical contact with MEC (i.e., chemical munitions) or chemical agents in other  than  munitions  configurations,  or  the  conduct  of  ground-disturbing  or  other  intrusive activities  in  areas  known  or  suspected  to  contain  MEC  or  chemical  agents  in  other  than munitions configurations.  When explosive hazards are known or suspected to exist along with chemical  agent  hazards  within  a  response  area  (e.g.,  the  munitions  response  area  (MRA)  or munitions response site), a submission that addresses both explosives and chemical agent safety is required. Munitions Response Explosives Safety Submission (MRESS)—An MRESS (also referred to as  an  explosives  safety  submission,  or  ESS)  addresses  explosives  safety  requirements  for munitions responses (e.g., field activities) that involve the intentional physical contact with MEC or the conduct of ground-disturbing or other intrusive activities in areas known or suspected to contain MEC.  A DoD Explosives Safety Board (DDESB) approved document that ensures all applicable DoD explosives safety standards are specified prior to a military munitions response activity    and  that  details  the  scope  of  the  project,  the  planned  work  activities,  and  potential hazards  (including  the  MCE),  and  the  methods  for  their  control  to  ensure  material  potentially posing  an  explosives  hazard  (MPPEH)  is  remediated  to  a  level  that  is  safe  for  current  or reasonably anticipated future land use. Munitions  Response  Explosives  Site  Plan—A  plan  required  for  MRS  investigations  or characterizations that involve intentional physical contact with MEC or CAs, regardless of CA configuration.

Net  Explosive  Weight  for  QD  (NEWQD)—The  total  quantity,  expressed  in  pounds [kilograms], of HE equivalency in each item or round to be used when applying QD criteria or other  standards.    The  NEWQD  is  equal  to  the  NEW  unless  hazard  classification  testing  has shown that a lower weight is appropriate for QD purposes.  Note:  If the NEWQD is less than the NEW, the reason is usually that propellant or other substances do not contribute as much to the blast effect as the same amount of HE would. New  Construction—For  the  intended  purpose  of  this  Manual  “new  construction”  is  the introduction of any facility “portable, temporary or permanent” inside the IB and must have an ESP accomplished and approved before authorizing construction or positioned in place.

Portal  Barricade—A  barricade  that  is  placed  in  front  of  an  entrance  into  an  underground storage facility.  Its function is to reflect that portion of the shock wave moving directly outward from the entrance, thereby, reducing the pressures along the extended tunnel axis and increasing the pressures in the opposite direction.  The result is a more circular IBD area centered at the portal. Potential  Explosion  Site  (PES)—The  location  of  a  quantity  of  AE  that  will  create  a  blast, fragment, thermal, or debris hazard in the event of an accidental explosion of its contents. AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 455 Primary Fragment—A fragment from material in intimate contact with reacting AE. Prohibited Area—A designated area at airfields, seadromes, or heliports where AE facilities are prohibited.

Quantity-Distance  (QD)—The  quantity  of  explosive  material  and  distance  separation relationships that provide defined levels of protection.  The relationships are based on levels of risk  considered  acceptable  for  specific  exposures  and  are  tabulated  in  applicable  QD  tables.  These separation distances do not provide absolute safety or protection.  Use greater distances than those in the QD tables, if practical. QD Safety Submission (QDSS)—see Explosives Site Plan (ESP) Radially  Aligned—Two  missiles  are  radially  aligned  if  the  fragment  pattern  from  either warhead intersect (90o angle) the other warhead.

Sensitivity Group (SG)—A category used to describe the susceptibility of HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 AE  to  sympathetic  detonation  (SD)  for  the  purpose  of  storage  within  a  HPM,  or  where revetments or SDW are used to reduce MCE.  Each HD 1.1 and HD 1.2 munition is designated, based on its physical attributes, into one of five SG (the SG can be found in the JHCS); directed energy weapons are further identified by assigning the suffix “D” following the SG designation.  The SGs are:  SG1 – Robust munitions (see Robust Munitions).  SG2 – Non-robust munitions (see  Non-Robust  Munitions).    SG3  –  Fragmenting  munitions  (see  Fragmenting  Munitions).   SG4  –  CBU  weapons  (see  Cluster  Bomb/Dispenser  Unit  munitions).    SG5  –  SD  Sensitive Munitions.  Munitions for which HPM non-propagation walls are not effective.  Munitions are assigned  to  SG5  when  either  very  sensitive  to  propagation  or  the  sensitivity  has  not  been determined.    Note:    For  purposes  of  determining  case  fragment  distances  for  intentional detonations, SG1 items will be either Robust or Extremely Heavy Case Munitions, SG3 items are considered  Robust  Munitions,  and  SG2,  SG4,  and  SG5  munitions  are  considered  Non-Robust Munitions.

Utilities—Utilities  include  water,  natural  gas,  steam,  air  lines,  electrical  lines,  communication lines and environmental facilities or equipment.  The term “Utility” does not apply to services provided  to  individual  or  group  explosives  facilities  when  that  service  is  not  also  secondarily provided to other parts of the installation or community (this includes underground POL lines servicing hardened aircraft shelters). Vulnerable  Construction—Buildings  of  vulnerable  construction  (e.g.,  schools,  high-rise buildings, restaurants, large warehouse-type retail stores) are of three main types:  1) Buildings of curtain wall construction that have four stories or more and are constructed with external non-load bearing panels on a separate sub-frame that are supported off the structural frame or floors for  the  full  height  of  the  building.    2)  Buildings  of  largely  glass  construction  that  have  four stories  or  more  and  have  at  least  50  percent  of  their  wall  areas  glazed.    3)  The  third  type  of vulnerable construction is impracticable to define precisely.  This covers any large building that employs  non  load-bearing  cladding  panels.    Definition  of  this  type  of  construction  cannot  be more precise because of the variation in types of modern structures Waiver—Written  authority  to  temporarily  deviate  from  requirements  of  this  Manual  when situations occur without sufficient time to comply with formal site planning procedures. Warehouse—These  are  facilities  for  storing  material  and  supplies  where  personnel  are infrequently present.  The material may, or may not be associated with AE.  Facilities must be sited  as  warehouses  if  they  are  used  to  store  inert  munitions  components  as  part  of  the accountable munitions stockpile. Waste  Military  Munition—Military  munitions  are  waste  when  they  are  solid  or  hazardous waste  under  the  regulations  (42  U.S.C.  9601,  et  seq.,  reference  (ao))  implementing  40  CFR Subpart EE Part 264, reference (am) RCRA, or defined as a waste under a DoD Component’s written  procedures.    Waste  military  munitions  are  defined  in  40  CFR  Part  266.202.    (Note:  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 461 Make decisions about whether specific munitions are or are not waste with reference to of 40 CFR Part 260.10 and Parts 266.200 through 266.206).  An unused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs:  1) The munition is abandoned by being disposed of, burned, detonated (except during intended use), incinerated, or treated before disposal.  2) The munition is removed from storage in a military magazine or other storage area for the purpose of being  disposed  of,  burned,  or  incinerated,  or  treated  prior  to  disposal.    3)  The  munition  is deteriorated or damaged (e.g., the integrity of the munition is compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot be put into serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used for other purposes; or,  4) An authorized military official has declared the munition a solid waste.  (Note:  Declaration by an “authorized military official” that munitions are waste (40 CFR Part 266.202(b) (4)) has a very limited meaning and applicability.  The only example is a declaration by the Army in 1984 that M55 rockets are waste.  The Environmental Protection  Agency  expects  that  such  a  declaration  would  be  in  writing.    A  decision  that munitions  are  unserviceable,  or  that  they  are  to  be  transferred  into  a  demilitarization  account does  not,  by  itself,  constitute  a  decision  that  the  munitions  are  solid  waste).    A  used  or  fired military munition is a solid waste if:  1) when transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is not a range, for the purposes of storage,  reclamation, treatment, disposal, or treatment before disposal; or, 2) if recovered, collected, and then disposed of by burial, or land filling either on or off a range.  For the RCRA (Section 1004(27) of reference (am), a used or fired military munition is a solid waste, and, therefore, is potentially subject to RCRA corrective action  authorities  under  Section  3004(u)  and  3004(v),  and  3008  (h)  of  reference  (am),  or, imminent and substantial endangerment authorities under Section 7003, of reference (am) if the munition lands off-range and is not promptly rendered safe and/or retrieved.  Any imminent and substantial threats associated with any remaining material must be addressed.  If remedial action is not possible, the operator of the range must maintain a record of the event for as long as any threat remains.  The record must include the type of munition and its location (to the extent the location  is  known).    (For  further  clarification  see  40  CFR  Part  266.202  under  “Definition  of Solid Waste.”) Wharf—A landing place or platform built into the water or along the shore for the berthing of vessels. Wharf Yard—An AE area close to a pier or wharf where railcars or trucks are temporarily held in support of pier or wharf operations. Wingwall—A wall located on either side of an ECM's headwall.  It may slope to the ground or may join a wingwall from an adjacent ECM.  It may be monolithic (of single construction) or separated by expansion joints from the headwall.  The purpose of a wingwall is to retain the earth fill along the side slope of an ECM. With  its  own  means  of  initiation—An  AE  item  with  its  normal  initiating  device,  such  as  a detonator or detonating fuze, assembled to it or packed with it, and this device is considered to present  a  significant  risk  during  storage  and  transport,  but  not  one  great  enough  to  be unacceptable. Without  its  own  means  of  initiation—An  AE  item  without  its  normal  initiating  device assembled to it or packed with it.  The term also applies to an AE item packed with its initiating device, provided the device is packed so as to eliminate the risk of causing detonation of the AE item in the event of accidental functioning of the initiating device.  In addition, the term applies 462 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 to an AE item assembled with its initiating device provided there are protective features such that the initiating device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the AE item under conditions that are associated with storage and transport.  For hazard classification purposes, a means of initiation that  possesses  two  independent  effective  protective  features  is  not  considered  to  present  a significant  risk  of  causing  the  of  an  AE  item  under  conditions  associated  with  storage  and transport. Zone of Protection—The space beneath the LPS that is substantially immune to direct lightning.  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 463 Attachment 2 SAMPLE EXPLOSIVES SITE PLAN TRANSMITTAL LETTER MEMORANDUM FOR NAF/SEW FROM:  3415 TTW/CC 867 Bourbon St Lowry AFB, CO 80230-5309 SUBJECT:  Explosives Site Plan (ESP) Submission, ATC-LOWRY-10-S001, WITH EXCEPTIONS, Aboveground Magazine (AGM) 433, Lowry Air Force Base, CO 1.  Request routine processing and final approval of subject site plan for increasing net explosives weight for quantity distance (NEWQD) limits for an existing AGM.  Once approved, this ESP replaces ESP ATC-LOWRY-87-S008.  This facility does not comply with all explosives safety standards.  There are exceptions associated with this ESP.  This ESP has been coordinated with the base comprehensive plan; there are no future plans that impact this ESP.  The following information is provided for analysis purposes. a. This ESP sites an AGM for storage of AE.  The requested NEWQD for each hazard division (HD) is as follows:  b.  The attached AF Form 943 and map documents all paired potential explosion site (PES) and exposed site relationships within the IBD clear zone. c.  This ESP was accomplished using the Automated Explosive Safety Siting Program, Version XX (Current Version). d.  The required evaluation zone (EZ) of 874 feet falls within the IBD clear zone, therefore is not depicted on the location map.  The EZ was based on K11 for 500,000 pounds NEWQD of HD 1.1 IAW AFMAN 91-201, Table 14.1. e.  A glass breakage survey determined there are occupied facilities containing windows within IBD of this magazine.  Analyses revealed no risk to personnel from glass breakage.  Detailed analyses are attached. f.  There are no electromagnetic radiation hazards to AE at this magazine. g.  An LPS is installed.  The LPS meets all criteria within AFMAN 91-201, Chapter 5.  Drawings are attached. h.  Mixing quantities of HD 1.1, 1.2.x and 1.3 AE will comply with the requirements of DoD 6055.9-M, Volume 1. i.  This ESP has been coordinated with all applicable agencies.  There are no tenant units exposed by this magazine. 2.  There are two paired relationships where QD criteria cannot be met.  Use of compensatory measures cannot negate these exceptions.  As a result, there are two exemptions, NAF-LOWRY-10-E01 and ATC-LOWRY-10-E01, that require NAF and MAJCOM approval respectively.  All information pertaining to these exceptions are contained in the attached nomographs. 3.

Example SECAF Exemption Memorandum. MEMORANDUM FOR AF/SE SUBJECT:  SECAF Exemption to Explosives Quantity-Distance (QD) Standards at Aviano AB Allowing for Construction of a US Army Heavy Drop Rigging Complex  1.  Commanders in United States Air Forces in Europe and United States Army Europe are required to enhance the support of joint DoD operations during times of contingency.  To this end, the US Army has asked to build a new Heavy Drop Rigging Complex (HDRC) at Aviano AB to enhance 173rd Airborne Brigade deployment activities.  The proposed eight construction projects associated with this complex are less than the required explosives QD separation standards prescribed in DoD 6055.09-M and AFMAN 91-201 for 44 paired relationship explosives safety evaluations.   2.  The departures from the safety standards involve insufficient separation between the proposed structures and the installation boundary and between USAF and USA explosives and non-explosives locations.  The most serious of these departures is to the base boundary.  Italian civilians in fields adjacent to the base boundary are at risk of death should an explosive mishap occur at either of the US Army HDRC explosives structures.  Although the fields adjacent to the base boundary are currently used for agriculture, and are infrequently occupied by civilians, residential or business development of this land would increase the number of civilians in harm’s way.  It is my understanding; however, that a restrictive easement has been approved by the Italian regional panel limiting civilian exposure to risk by freezing use of the land at current levels, and prohibiting future development.   3.  After due consideration, I find that compelling operational requirements necessitate deviation from DoD explosives QD standards with regard to the location of a new US Army HDRC at Aviano AB.  Based on the concurrence provided by the highest US Army approval authority for explosives safety exemptions, DASA (I & E), and the absence of viable alternatives, I conclude that exemptions for the US Army HDRC are appropriate, and approve the start of this US Army-funded project.   4.  I hereby approve the exemptions for the eight US Army HDRC locations.  Permanent copies of this memorandum will be maintained at AFSEC/SEW, USAFE-AFAFRICA, and Aviano AB.  This exemption will be reviewed every five years at the appropriate level for the continued use of this exception IAW AFMAN 91-201 and to verify the continued accuracy of the risk assessment provided. Note:  Some offices and symbols have changed.   468 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 Figure A4.2.  Example SECAF Exemption Memorandum. MEMORANDUM FOR AF/SE SUBJECT:  SECAF Exemption to Explosives Quantity-Distance (QD) Standards at Osan AB Allowing for Construction of Fighter Squadron Operations/ Aircraft Maintenance Facility Addition  1.  Commanders in Korea have a requirement to enhance the support of combat aircraft operations during times of contingency and wartime operations.  As a result, the expansion of aircraft support facility 1702 is required to enhance the 51st Fighter Wing’s ability to maintain combat assets.   2.  Based on the proposed expansion location and its proximity to three nearby 3rd generation hardened aircraft shelters, the required explosives QD separation standards as prescribed in AFMAN 91-201 are not met.  As a result, personnel and assets located in the facility could be subjected to blast overpressure and fragmentation far in excess of those prescribed during exercise and contingency operations.  Should a mishap occur at the closest of the three aircraft shelters, consequences to the building 1702 expansion could include up to five fatalities, serious injuries, mission interruption, and up to $500,000 in damage.   3.  I have weighed the need for the need for the 25th fighter squadron operations/aircraft maintenance facility expansion at Osan AB against the expected impact in the event of a mishap.  In the absence of available alternatives, I conclude that an exemption for the construction of the aircraft support facility expansion is appropriate, and approve the expenditure of construction funds.   4.  Permanent copies of this memorandum will be maintained at AFSEC/SEW, HQ PACAF, and Osan AB.  This exemption will be reviewed every five years at the appropriate level for the continued use of this exception IAW AFMAN 91-201.  AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 469 Attachment 5 QD GUIDANCE FOR ON-BASE ROADS A5.1.  QD  Guidance  for  On-Base  Roads.  In order to prevent the generation of a significant number  of  QD  exemptions,  DoD  6055.09-M  requirements  allow  the  DoD  components  to establish  procedures  for  assessing,  documenting,  and  accepting  the  risks  associated  with application  of  QD  criteria  to  on-base  roads  for  on-base  road  relationships  existing  prior  to  1 October 2000.  QD criteria are based on the traffic density (PTR or IBD).  After 1 October 2000, any changes to a PES increasing explosives safety risk, increasing QD arc, constructing a new PES, or constructing a new on-base road, requires application of QD criteria to on-base roads traveled by personnel not involved in munitions related operations.  If QD criteria cannot be met, the formal exemption requirements of AFMAN 91-201 must be followed. (T-1). A5.2.  Sited PES/On-Base Road Relationships.  For those sited PES/on-base road relationships existing prior to 1 October 2000; the following risk assessment and documentation are required to be accomplished: (T-1). A5.2.1.  On a copy of the installation map, identify the following: A5.2.1.1.  All PESs having QD arcs (PTR or IBD based on traffic density) encompassing on-base roads traveled by personnel not involved in munitions-related operations. A5.2.1.2.  The NEWQD of the above PESs. A5.2.1.3.  The applicable QD arcs (PTR or IBD) of the above PESs based on the traffic density. A5.2.1.4.  The segments of the applicable on-base roads passing through the above arcs. A5.2.2.  Perform a risk assessment of the relationships shown above IAW RM procedures.  Some factors to consider include: A5.2.2.1.  Operational necessity. A5.2.2.2.  The  operation  being  performed  (e.g.,  static  storage,  maintenance,  and production). A5.2.2.3.  Operational activity cycles. A5.2.2.4.  Alternate routes. A5.2.2.5.  Traffic density. A5.2.2.6.  Accident records. A5.2.2.7.  Time interval of exposure. A5.2.2.8.  Type and quantity of munitions in proximity to the area transited. A5.2.2.9.  The closest distance from the area transited to the PES. A5.2.2.10.  The need for installation-related personnel to transit the ESQD arc. A5.2.3.  Document  the  Commander’s  risk  acceptance  through  a  formal  memorandum  and review upon change of the approval authority. (T-1).  This memorandum must include the map  showing  the  relationships  for  which  he/she  is  accepting  risk,  a  summary  of  the  risk 470 AFMAN91-201  21 MARCH 2017 assessment, and a statement that the subject relationships existing as of 1 October 2000. (T-1). A5.3.  Risk  Assessment  and  Documentation.  It  is  highly  recommended  that  the  above  risk assessment and documentation be accomplished to accurately capture the relationships, existing as of 1 October 2000.  The Commander’s risk acceptance and attached map must be included in amendments to site plans (for PESs existing prior to 1 October 2000), or referenced if previously submitted with another site plan amendment, that does not increase the QD arc. (T-1).  As stated previously, after 1 October 2000, any changes to a PES that increases its QD arc, construction of a new PES, construction of a new on-base road, or increases traffic density requires application of  QD  criteria  to  on-base  roads  traveled  by  personnel  not  involved  in  munitions  related operations (see paragraph 12.16.).
