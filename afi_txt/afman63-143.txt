Overview. 1.1.1.  CAM is the management and execution of sustainment funding by a single AF process owner.  HQ AFMC is the designated AF CAM Executive Agent for CAM-associated funding and  requirements  determination.    CAM-associated  funding  includes  Weapon  System Sustainment (WSS), AF Active Duty Cost per Flying Hour Program (CPFH), and Operations & Maintenance (O&M) Support Equipment purchases. 1.2.  Applicability. 1.2.1.  This AFMAN applies to all Program Managers (PMs) and MAJCOMs utilizing CAM-associated  funding  or  involved  in  sustainment  requirements  determination.    Air  National Guard,  AF  Reserve  Command,  and  AF  Space  Command  utilize  CAM  processes  and schedules, but manage their own requirements validation and execution of funds. 1.3.  Scope. 1.3.1.  CAM  provides  enterprise  management  at  the  AF  level  by  focusing  resources  on  AF priorities  as  defined  by  operators.    CAM  encompasses  the  AF  WSS  enterprise,  the  CPFH program, and O&M Support Equipment purchases. 1.3.2.  Within  WSS,  there  are  four  business  process  areas  managed  as  part  of  CAM:  Depot Purchased  Equipment  Maintenance  (DPEM),  Contract  Logistics  Support  (CLS),  Sustaining Engineering (Sust Eng), and Technical Orders (TO).  The DPEM business process includes multiple  sub-categories:  Aircraft  and  Missile  Requirements  (AMR),  Engine  Maintenance, Area/Base/Manufacture  (A/B/M),  Software  Maintenance,  Storage,  and  Exchangeables,  and Other Major End Items (OMEI).  Additionally, the first DPEM sub-category, AMR, has three supporting  processes:  the  Engineering  Requirements  Review  Process  (ERRP),  the  Bill  of Work (BOW) process, and the Requirements Supportability process. 1.3.3.  The CPFH program covers costs that directly support the launch, recovery, inspection, servicing,  and  maintenance  of  an  aircraft  or  aircraft  component  or  a  piece  of  support equipment that directly supports aircraft maintenance and fuel.  The CPFH budget has three components:      Depot  Level  Reparables  (DLRs),  Consumable  Supplies,  and  Aviation Petroleum Oil and Lubricants (AVPOL). 1.3.4.  The  O&M  Support  Equipment  Purchase  program  is  the  only  non-WSS,  non-CPFH program managed by CAM.  These resources support assets belonging to active AF, National Guard Bureau (NGB), AFRC, and AFMC Research, and Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E). 1.4.  Roles and Responsibilities 1.4.1.  SAF/AQ, SAF/FM, AF/A2, AF/A3, AF/A4, and AF/A5/8: 1.4.1.1.  Provide  strategic  guidance and  advocacy  through  the  Logistics Panel  and  other corporate structure forums.   10 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 1.4.1.2.  Support  the  CAM  Governance  Structure  represented  in  Figure  1.1,  CAM Governance Structure. 1.4.2.  AFMC/CC: 1.4.2.1.  Establishes  an  AFMC  CAM  Office  responsible  for  oversight  for  the  WSS process. 1.4.2.2.  Authorizes  CAM  guidance  and  training  currently  provided  through  the  AFMC CAM Office, as coordinated through the CAM Executive Committee (EC) chaired by the AFMC/CV. 1.4.2.3.

Provides  enterprise  level  oversight  for  the  WSS  processes,  acting  as  the integrator, facilitator, and continuous process improvement champion. 1.4.5.  Other MAJCOM/CCs: 1.4.5.1.  Provide  operational  perspectives  and  recommendations  (weapon  system availability, capability, pilot throughput, etc.), that affect the requirements process. 1.4.5.2.  Provide  MAJCOM  weapon  system  sustainment  Point  of  Contacts  (POCs)  who review, validate, prioritize and coordinate requirement inputs, as applicable. 1.4.6.  Lead  Command  POCs  set  the  desired  capability  levels  and  validate  and  prioritize WSS requirements. 1.4.7.  Program Executive Officers (PEOs) ensure assigned PMs define, review, validate, and publish accurate, reliable, timely, executable, and properly documented requirements within Centralized  Access  for  Data  Exchange  (CAFDEx™)  for  their  programs,  using  definitions, timelines, and requirements specified in this AFMAN and HQ AFMC/A4F tasking’s. 1.4.8.  Funds  Holder  POCs  coordinate  with  the  Lead  Commands  POCs  in  validating, prioritizing and budgeting all requirements. 1.4.9.  Program  Managers  develop  detailed  requirements  to  meet  desired  capabilities  and spread funding to minimize risk and maximize capability to the warfighter. 1.5.  CAM Governance. 1.5.1.  illustrates the CAM Advisory Council (AC), CAM Executive Steering Group (ESG), and CAM EC membership and structure. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   11 Figure 1.1.  CAM Governance Structure. 1.5.1.1.  Process  development  and  execution  should  be  worked  at  the  lowest  level  through working integrated process teams.  The CAM AC serves as an advisory board to the AFMC CAM Program Office. 1.5.2.  The CAM ESG is the decision making body for the process development effort and is responsible for approving requirements and resolving issues that cannot be resolved at lower levels. 1.5.3.  The  CAM  EC  is  the  decision  making  body  that  provides  oversight  for  the  CAM Process, sets goals, and provides vision and resources.  The CAM EC meets quarterly or as needed. 1.5.4.  The  AFMC  CAM  Office  provides  oversight  over  the  CAM  process  through  the approved governance structure.  This includes ensuring continuous process improvements are documented/implemented  as  required,  providing  stakeholder  training,  managing  CAM   12 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 technical content, releasing process data calls to all stakeholders, and participating in process collaboration/reviews.  The frequency of CAM Governance Structure meetings is driven by major  Planning,  Programming,  Budgeting  and  Execution  (PPBE)  milestones,  usually  to develop  risk-assessed  positions  in  support  of  the  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM) and Execution Plan. 1.6.  CAM Process and Process Flow. 1.6.1.  The  CAM  process  covers requirements,  programming/budgeting,  and  execution  (See Figure  1.2).    CAM  is  facilitated  by  using  CAFDEx™,  the  AF  standard  data  base  tool  to support WSS PPBE. Figure 1.2.  The CAM Process. 1.6.1.1.  A  primary  element  of  CAM  is  the  consolidated  Logistics  Requirements Determination  Process  (LRDP).    Program  offices  use  standard  engineering  and forecasting practices to build a set of requirements within each business process area, as needed,  for  the  Future  Years  Defense  Program  (FYDP).    The  focus  of  requirements definition is two-fold.  A “first look” will occur on the primary upcoming POM year (i.e., current  year  +2),  while  a  “final  look”  will  occur  on  the  upcoming  Execution  Plan  year (i.e., current year +1).  Only major program changes through the remainder of the FYDP will be addressed in out years (i.e., current year + 3 and beyond). 1.6.1.2.  The  LRDP  is  used  to  develop,  validate  and  prioritize  AF  Weapon  System Sustainment (WSS) logistics requirements.  The LRDP is an annual process comprised of the  following  major  phases:    Requirements  Preparation;  Requirements  Definition including Quality Control phase 1 (QC-1); Requirements Collaboration including Quality Control  phase  2 (QC-2);  Requirements  Validation/Prioritization;  and  Publish Requirements.    The  LRDP  schedule  is  distributed  annually  by  the  CAM  office  prior  to the start of the process by means of Power Point slides, emails, and through CAFDEx™.  All stakeholders in the LRDP process must comply with the annually published schedule.  Exact beginning and completion dates, which are driven by the start date for the LRDP schedule  release,  will  be  specified  within  the  HQ  AFMC/A4F  tasking  correspondence.  Figure  1.3.  depicts  the  major  sequential  phases  of  the  LRDP.    Subsequent  paragraphs define each of these phases. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   13 Figure 1.3.  LRDP Flow. 1.6.1.2.1.  During the Prepare Requirements phase, the Program Office identifies new and emerging requirements and validates existing requirements in CAFDEx™. 1.6.1.2.2.  During  the  Define  Requirements  phase,  the  Program  Office  adds  to  and updates existing program requirements in CAFDEx™.  Program requirements include force  structure  changes,  as  well  as  changes  in  operational  tempo,  historical  trends, Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) schedules, engine overhaul projections, and any  other  major  programmatic  changes  provided  by  HQ  AF  and  Lead  Commands POCs  through  the  FYDP.    The  Define  Requirements  phase  includes  the  QC-1 Review,  a  review  used  to  provide  an  assessment  of  the  state  of  published requirements documented within CAFDEx™.  This review is performed by the CAM Office. 1.6.1.2.3.  During  the  Requirements  Collaboration  phase,  the  PMs,  MAJCOMs,  and Funds  Holders  collaborate  on  requirements  using  CAFDEx™.    All  stakeholders review  and  collaborate  on  all  tasks,  with  emphasis  on  new  tasks,  criteria  tasks, variances,  and  Over  and  Above   Teleconferences,  video-teleconferences, e-collaboration, or face-to-face meetings may be used to discuss and reach consensus on the requirements.  This phase includes a QC-2 Review to address special interest areas needing increased oversight. (O&A) tasks. 1.6.1.2.4.  During  the  Requirements  Validation/Prioritization  phase,  the  weapons system PMs, in conjunction with Lead Commands POCs, Funds Holders POCs, and POCs  from  potentially  affected  supported commands,  validate  the  requirements  that have  been  documented  in  CAFDEx™  by  the  applicable  Program  Office.    This collaborative  validation  should  ensure  requirements  are  accurate,  reliable,  timely, properly  formatted,  and  documented  (file  maintained)  in  the  CAFDEx™  database.  Once  validated,  the  PM,  with  assistance  from  Lead  Commands  and  supported commands  POCs,  prioritizes  requirements  according  to  their  relative  importance  in meeting  AF  priorities  (e.g., weapon system availability, capability, pilot throughput, etc.). 1.6.1.2.5.  During  the  final  phase,  Publish  Requirements,    the  requirements  are electronically signed by the PM or his/her designee, and they are then electronically published in CAFDEx™ by the PM or the designee.  The report can now be accessed and used as required.   14 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 1.6.1.2.6.

Overview. interservice  agreement. 2.1.1.  The  AMR  process  applies  to  all  AF  organizations  requiring  or  providing  Depot Maintenance (DM) on AF aircraft or missile systems.  It applies to all work, including work performed using military or government civilian personnel, by industry under contract, or via an   The  AMR  process  covers  Air  Force  Element  of Expense/Investment Code (AFEEIC) 54101, 54102, 56010, 54201, 54202, 56020 and Repair Group Category (RGC) A, B, C, and D.  This chapter and the next three chapters address the AMR  process.    This  chapter  outlines  the  AMR  process  and  provides  details  on  how  to develop,  review,  validate,  and  approve  depot  level  maintenance  and  repair  for  aircraft  and missile  systems  at  the  task  level.      Chapter  3  covers  the  AMR  Engineering  Requirements Review Process  (ERRP) that drives the generation of a new engineering requirement (task) from conception through approval.  Chapter 4 covers the Bill of Work (BOW) Process used as the outline for the Program Office to add, delete, and amend DM tasks.  Chapter 5 covers the Requirements Supportability Process that identifies the Duties/Task and process steps to ensure  the  scheduled  maintenance  tasks  in  the  AMR  Work  Specification  (Work  Spec)  and AMR Brochure are supportable using the supportability elements identified in the ERRP. 2.1.2.  Task  level  aircraft  and  missile  DM  requirements  are  documented  in  three  areas:  the AMR  Work  Spec,  the  AMR  Brochure,  and  the  Engineering  Requirements  Development Packet  (DEV  PAC).    Each  has  its  own  purpose  and  content  and  serves  as  subsets  of  the overarching AMR process. The AMR Work Spec documents general information relating to specific weapon system DM requirements.  The AMR Brochure identifies the DM tasks and hours  required  to  maintain  AF  aircraft  and  missile  systems  in  mission  ready  status.    The Engineering  Requirements  DEV  PAC  fully  defines  new  and  existing  scheduled  DM  task details, analysis, supportability elements and approval prior to a task being added, deleted, or amended in the AMR Work Spec. 2.1.3.  The  PM  must  follow  the  complete  AMR  Process,  including  the  ERRP  (Chapter  3), BOW  Process  (Chapter  4),  and  the  MRSP  (Chapter  5).    The  PM,  through  designees  in  the Program  Office,  manages  DM  provided  by  government  employees,  by  contractors,  and through interservice agreements.  The designees process timelines and completion dates, and they  evaluate  and  approve  proposed  scheduled  maintenance  tasks  maintained  in  the  AMR Websystem  in  CAFDEx™.   Tasks  include  hosting  the  annual  review,  facilitating collaboration  meetings,  and  negotiating  and  resolving  complex  maintenance  concerns  to ensure that scheduled maintenance tasks, hours, and narratives  in the AMR Websystem are updated annually.  The ultimate responsibility for management and coordination of the AMR process resides with the PM. 2.1.4.  Weapon  system  maintenance  requirements  are  determined  by  evaluating  data  from  a variety  of  sources.    For  operational  systems,  the  PM  relies  upon  information  provided  by programs outlined in this chapter.  For a new system transitioning from acquisition, the data available for the determination of these tasks is limited, and in most cases is defined by the   16 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 contractor  responsible  for  designing  the  weapon  system.   When  contract  support  is needed, every effort should be made to follow and utilize AF AMR standard processes and formats. 2.2.  The AMR Process. 2.2.1.  Figure  2.1  identifies  the  three  stages  of  the  AMR  Process.    Stage  one  involves defining new tasks and updating existing tasks.  Stage two involves building hours for new tasks  and  adjusting  hours  associated  with  existing  tasks.    Stage  three  involves  PM certification of hours for each scheduled maintenance task to produce a finalized, published requirement for depot maintenance by weapon system and Fiscal Year (FY). Figure 2.1.  Aircraft and Missile Requirements Process. 2.3.  Define/Update Tasks (Stage one). 2.3.1.  The first stage of the AMR Process begins with a Data Call/Tasking Correspondence on  or  about  15  November  each  year.    Exact  beginning  and  completion  dates,  which  are driven  by  the  start  date  for  the  LRDP,  will  be  specified  within  the  HQ  AFMC/A4F  Data Call/Tasking Correspondence.  HQ AFMC/A4F sends the Data Call/Tasking Correspondence to  Air  Logistics  Complex  (ALC)  Offices,  System  Program  Offices,  MAJCOMs  POCs, Maintenance Groups POCs, Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) POC, and 653 Supply Chain Operations Wing (SCOW) for the current year.  Additional information may be provided or requested as needed. 2.3.2.  Emerging  requirements  can  occur  at  any  time,  but  maintenance  tasks  must  be documented annually in the AMR Work Spec NLT 1 March and in the approved/published AMR Brochure NLT 15 June.  Requirements are based on need and not on the availability of funds. 2.3.3.  AMR Work Specs are of prime importance in securing maintenance services under the AF  DM  concept  and  are  the  most  critical  documents  in  maintenance  negotiations.    AMR Work  Specs  are  developed  and  files  maintained  within  CAFDEx™;  they  are  prepared  for supporting  organic  (assigned  to  a  military  organization)  workload  agreements,  commercial contracts,  and  interservice  agreements.    The  AMR  Work  Spec  documents  information relating  to  specific  weapon  systems  including:    general  information,  receipt  of  the  weapon system  at  the  facility,  work  requirements,  final  processing  of  the  weapon  system,  and applicable TOs and directives.  AMR Work Specs shall not to be used as depot level TOs. 2.3.4.  The  PM  Engineering  Branch  develops  the  DM  technical  requirements  and  provides them to the Production Management Specialist (PMS) Buyer/AMR Work Spec manager who is responsible for the overall preparation, content, and coordination of the AMR Work Spec.  The PMS Buyer/AMR Work Spec manager file maintains the AMR Work Spec document in CAFDEx™ and makes it available to the appropriate stakeholders and schedules the annual AMR Work Spec review.  The PMS Buyer/AMR Work Spec manager incorporates changes AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   17 identified  during  the  review  and  forwards  the  AMR  Work  Spec  to  the  Source  of  Repair (SOR) for Direct Product Standard Hours (DPSH) development.  The PMs Chief Engineer is the final authority for the technical requirements in the AMR Work Spec. 2.3.5.  AMR  Work  Specs  will  be  updated  and  reviewed  annually  to  ensure  that  new  or changed tasks, as well as existing tasks, are adequately defined.  AMR Work Specs govern the scope of maintenance and are used by the PMS Buyer/AMR Work Spec manager to state the DM required to be performed on government equipment. 2.3.6.  The  annual  review  may  also  be  used  by  weapon  system  engineers  to  address  other program  initiatives  which  may  impact  a  weapon  system’s  technical  inspection  and maintenance  practices.    Items  procured  under  the  Improved  Item  Replacement  Program (reference Air Force Material Command [AFMC] Instruction 23-121, AFMC Improved Item Replacement  Program  (IIRP)  and  Demand  Reduction  Initiative  (DRI)  Guidance  and Procedures), may necessitate a change to the AMR Work Spec if the items are to be replaced during PDM.  Any engineering issues affecting the maintenance of AF weapon systems that may  adversely  or  positively  affect  airworthiness  of  the  systems  should  be  discussed  during the annual review. 2.3.7.  AMR  Work  Spec  Collaboration/Review.    The  Lead  Command  POC,  PM,  and  all appropriate Funds  Holders  collaborate  to  review  and  approve  all    new,  amended  or  deleted scheduled  DM  tasks  for  the  performance  year.    This  review  must  be  completed  No  Later Than (NLT) 1 April. 2.3.8.  AMR  Work  Spec  Validated.    This  task  is  comprised  of  the  next  fiscal  year  AMR Work Spec coordination and validation.  Changes  to the AMR Work Spec are addressed in the Build/Adjust Hours stage. 2.3.9.  AMR  Work  Spec  Published.    After  completion  of  all  e-collaboration,  the  Program Office, PMS Buyer/AMR Work Spec manager will certify and publish the AMR Work Spec for  next  fiscal  year.    The  AMR  Work  Spec  will  be  electronically  published  in  CAFDEx™ NLT 1 April. 2.4.  Build/Adjust Hours (Stage two). 2.4.1.  Immediately  after  completion  of  the  Define/Update  Scheduled  Maintenance  Tasks Stage one, the Build/Adjust Hours Stage two begins with the validated AMR Work Spec. 2.4.2.  All scheduled organic DM workloads for AMR will be file maintained by manhours. 2.4.3.  DPSH  and  Occurrence  Factors  are  developed  for  new  scheduled  maintenance  tasks, and are adjusted as needed for existing non-trended tasks.  Technical estimates are finalized by the ALC.  Trend analysis is performed as needed by the ALC. 2.4.4.  Manhour  data  is  shown  in  DPSH.    When  a  task  applies  to  a  Mission  Design  Series (MDS)  but  is  not  active  for  that  AMR  Brochure  year,  or  recommended  for  deletion,  the DPSH hours are kept in the AMR Brochure but the occurrence factor is shown as 0.00.  New or  changed  operations  identified  during  initial  preparation  or  periodic  AMR  Work  Spec reviews  are  assigned  DPSH  labor  standards  by  maintenance  planning  units.    Standards  are based on approved data, group timing, work sampling, technical estimates, or trend analysis, and maintained in a project workload planning system.  Where feasible, three years of data should be considered.   18 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 2.4.5.  Occurrence Factors.  If all aircraft/missiles of the same MDS input during a particular FY are to receive the task (i.e. have that task applied to them), then the occurrence factor is 1.00.  If only a percentage of the aircraft/missiles will receive the task, then the occurrence factor should reflect  that percentage.  For example, if 12 PDMs are scheduled in  a FY, but only 6 will be receiving a particular task, then the occurrence factor will be (.50). 2.4.6.  Trend  Analysis.    Performed  by  the  Maintenance  Group  on  all  AMR  tasks  with occurrence  factors  less  than  100%  and  tasks  with  unpredictable  workload  (Note:  not performed on  a once- through- the-fleet, predictable task).  There are two main purposes of trend  analysis.    The  first  purpose  is  to  recommend  changes  to  hours  of  trended  tasks.    The second  is  to  recommend  changes  to  occurrence  factors  of  trended  tasks.    Neither  purpose should be seen  as  automatic approval of projections  or  to usurp any of the functions of the AMR review process.  Any large growth in hours (plus or minus 20% or 50 hours) must be justified,  even  if  using  the  recommended  trend  value.    Use  the  “Trend  Justification”  tab  in CAFDEx  AMR  to  document  the  driver  of  the  increase  or  decrease.    Properly  justified alternative trend analysis methods may be used if approved during the AMR review process. The following subparagraphs contain rules to use during trend analysis. trend  analysis  comes  from 2.4.6.1.  Standard  data  for the  Programmed  Depot Maintenance  Scheduling  System  (PDMSS)  and  must  include  the  following  5  categories of information:  MDS, Serial Number (S/N), AMR Work Spec Code, Completion Date, and Standard Hours.  Use of alternate data, such as engineering data from systems other than PDMSS, is acceptable provided all five categories of information are used.  Use of alternate  data  must  be  documented  on  the  “FY  Notes”  tab  within  the  AMR  task  and approved during the AMR review process. 2.4.6.2.  Three years of historical or engineering data is the standard number of years to use for trend analysis.  More or fewer years can be used to accommodate small fleets or to compensate for changes in scope.  Any deviation from the three year standard must be documented on the “FY Notes” tab within the AMR task and approved during the AMR review process. 2.4.6.3.  If a strong upward trend (R squared value greater than .75) is shown and other factors have been ruled out, then use the trend line value as the out-year recommendation.  In this case, also check to see if the predicted cost to repair in the out-years is below 70% of  the  cost  to  replace.    If  the  case  can  be  made  to  replace  rather  than  repair,  then  the appropriate planning needs to be implemented to assure parts availability.  Be prepared to discuss the cause of the increasing trend.  The task should be monitored to see if the trend continues. 2.4.6.4.  If  a  strong  downward  trend  (R  squared  value  greater  than  .75)  is  shown  and other factors have been ruled out, then the recommendation is to use the mean value for the  out-year  projection  if  the  trend  line  is  projected  to  be  between  the  mean  and  lower range  mean,  or  to  use  the  lower  range  mean  if  the  projected  trend  is  below  the  lower range mean.  Be prepared to discuss the cause of the downward trend.  The task should be monitored to see if trend continues. 2.4.6.5.  If  the  trend  is  upward  and  the  R  squared  value  is  between  .3  and  .75,  then  the recommended out-year projection is to use the upper range mean. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   19 2.4.6.6.  If the trend is downward and the R squared value is between .3 and .75, then the recommendation is to use the mean value for the out-year projection. 2.4.6.7.  If  the  trend  is  either  up  or  down  and  the  R  squared  value  is  between  0  and  .3, then the data is assumed to be random in nature and the recommended out-year projection is to use the upper range mean. 2.4.6.8.  In  the  case  where  recommendations  for  the  out-years  fall  outside  the  upper  or lower range mean, it is up to the Program Office to provide sufficient explanation of the root causes to support the mathematical findings and document this within the AMR task.  Use the “Trend Justification” tab to document the cause(s) and/or finding(s).  The AMR review process members have decision authority on all recommendations. 2.4.6.9.  The Lower Range Mean (LRM) should be used for all O&A tasks.  If the LRM is not used, the Program Office must provide sufficient documentation to explain the root causes  and  support  the  use  of  another  value.    Use  the  “Trend  Justification”  tab  to document the justification. 2.4.6.10.  Any  deviations  from  the  recommended  hours  based  on  the  trending  data  or above business rules must have the rationale documented on the “Trend Justification” tab within the AMR task. 2.4.7.  Immediately after completion of the Build/Adjust Hours, the Published Hours by Task begins. 2.4.8.  Draft/Updated  DPSH  and  occurrence  factors  are  produced,  updated  and  file maintained in the AMR Module of CAFDEx™. 2.4.9.  The  PM  and  ALC  maintenance  personnel  review  the  draft  DPSH  and  occurrence factors, and then negotiate if necessary.  Unsupportable scheduled maintenance tasks are also reviewed to determine if actions can be taken to preclude delaying the task to a future year.  Negotiation is internal to AFMC.  This activity should be completed NLT 1 April. 2.4.10.  After  internal  negotiation,  the  proposed  DPSH  and  occurrence  factors  will  be updated and file maintained in the AMR Module of CAFDEx™, completed NLT 1 April. 2.4.11.  The individual tasks, along with the associated manhour requirement and narratives, are  file-maintained  within  CAFDEx™  AMR.    All  operations  that  are  task-specific  are identified to the appropriate task group. 2.4.12.  Review. 2.4.12.1.  Identify/Review  Criteria  Tasks.    Scheduled  Maintenance  Tasks  meeting  the following criteria will be identified and reviewed: 2.4.12.1.1.  Any new tasks. 2.4.12.1.2.  Once-through-the-fleet tasks. 2.4.12.1.3.  Tasks that have changed +/- 20% and/or +/- 50 hours. 2.4.12.1.4.  Tasks with supportability issues that impact aircraft flow days or that will move a task to a future year. 2.4.12.1.5.  Tasks identified and requested by AMR voting members.   20 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 2.4.12.2.  Reviews  are  conducted  during  the  August  timeframe  as  directed  by  HQ AFMC/A4F.  All tasks meeting the criteria established above will be reviewed and voted on by the following AMR voting members: 2.4.12.2.1.  AFMC CAM Office. 2.4.12.2.2.  PM. 2.4.12.2.3.  Lead Command. 2.4.12.2.4.  Funds Holders. 2.4.12.2.5.  ALC Maintenance Group. 2.4.12.3.  This  Group  file  maintains  changes  from  the  review  meetings  and  creates  the baseline  AMR  Brochure.    Once  changes  from  the  review  meeting  have  been  file maintained  in  the  AMR  Module  of  CAFDEx™,  the  AMR  Brochure  is  considered baselined. 2.4.13.  AMR Brochure. 2.4.13.1.  AMR  Brochure  baseline.    This  part  of  Stage  two  is  completed  with  the successful collaboration of the scheduled maintenance task; the Program Office will then validate the baseline AMR Brochure.  This activity will be completed NLT 15 June. 2.4.13.2.  The AMR Brochure is developed to identify the DM tasks required to maintain AF aircraft and missile systems in mission ready status  and is digitally file maintained in CAFDEx™ AMR.  Requirements are based on need and not on the availability of funds.  The  AMR  Brochure  supports  organic  workload  agreements  and  the  AMR  Work  Spec.  New  or  changed  scheduled  maintenance  tasks  identified  during  the  AMR  Work  Spec reviews  are  assigned  DPSH  labor  standards  by  maintenance  planning  units.    Standards are  based  on  approved  data,  group  timing,  work  sampling,  technical  estimates,  or  trend analysis,  and  maintained  in  a  project  workload  planning  system.    Where  feasible,  three years  of  data  should  be  considered.    The  specifications  and  explanation  of  AMR Brochure sections are contained in Table 1-5, of TO 00-25-4. 2.4.13.3.  The  AMR  Brochure  is  developed  and  managed  by  the  Program  Office responsible  for  the  weapon  system  management,  with  input  from  the  Lead  Commands POC,  Funds  Holders  POC,  customers,  and  the  organic  SOR  representative.    It  is  used primarily  by  weapon  system  engineers,  equipment  specialists,  production  managers, planners,  schedulers,  requirements  functionals,  the  Consolidated  Sustainment  Activity Group-Maintenance  (CSAG-M),  HQ  USAF,  HQ  AFMC,  and  the  MAJCOMs.    It  also documents  the  programmatic  DM  requirements  for  weapon  systems  and  provides  data used to substantiate budget submission. 2.4.13.4.  The PMS Buyer/AMR Work Spec Manager completes the draft AMR Brochure after  receiving  the  maintenance  hours  from  the  SOR  representative.    A  new  weapon system  AMR  Brochure  is  prepared  for  each  FY  program,  portrayed  in  a  3  year  format.  AMR Brochures are finalized at least one FY prior to the execution year. 2.5.  PM certification of hours (Stage three). 2.5.1.  AMR  Brochure  published.    After  completion  of  e-collaboration  on  changed/updated scheduled  maintenance  tasks  in  stage  two,  the  Program  Office  will  certify/publish  the AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   21 finalized AMR task groups (AMR Brochure) and their associated hours.  This activity will be completed NLT 15 June.  Any changes or updates to the published AMR Brochure must be coordinated  and  approved  by  the  AMR  voting  members  through  e-collaboration  and  the change process using the AMR module in CAFDEx™. 2.6.  Workload. 2.6.1.  The  published  AMR  Brochure  is  used  to  feed  the  Budgeting  and  Workload  Review processes. 2.6.1.1.  The published AMR Brochure is used by both the Budgeting and Workload Review processes and serves as the baseline for the hours associated with the scheduled maintenance tasks  to  be  completed.    The  workload  review  process  follows  AFMCI  21-185,  Depot Maintenance Workload and Capability Management. 2.7.  Program Control Number (PCN) and Task Groups. 2.7.1.  The  hours  from  the  task  maintenance  module  interface  to  the  PCN  in  the  LRDP module of CAFDEx™.  Requirements at the PCN level are reflected by "Task Groups".  A task  group  is  a  breakout  of  the  work  that  will  be  performed  when  an  aircraft  or  missile  is brought  into  the  depot.    Examples  of  task  groups  are  "PDM",  “Analytical  Condition Inspection (ACI)", "Paint", etc.  Each task in the task maintenance module must be assigned to a task group.  Variance narratives at the task group level must be provided. 2.7.1.1.  Once  the  DM  Program  for  a  weapon  system  has  been  approved  at  the  AMR Work Spec review and the DPSH have been negotiated, the DPSH are summarized at the PCN level. 2.7.1.2.  Quantities,  hours  and  dollars  (where  applicable)  for  RGCs  A,  B,  C  and  D  are file-maintained  at  the  PCN  level  for  organic,  contractual,  and  interservice  agreement aircraft and missile maintenance workloads. 2.7.1.3.  For the organic requirements programmed in the POM, the hours are pulled from the task maintenance module at the task group level.  The user identifies the task groups that are assigned to each PCN.  The task group that is driving the aircraft or missile into the  depot  is  designated  as  the  "Driving  Record".   Only  the  quantities  on  the  driving record  are  reflected  in  the  PCN  total.    The  user  also  identifies  whether  the  estimated hours or the actual hours will be used from each task group.  It is very important that this step is done correctly to ensure that the total hours and dollars for the PCN are correct.  Estimated hours should be used for the driving record task group and the ACI task group.  Actual hours should be used for any other task groups. 2.7.1.4.  A  breakout  of  quantities  by  Lead  and  Supported  Commands  is  required  for programmed workloads. 2.7.1.5.  Variance  narratives  are  required at the  PCN  level  for  values  that  have  changed by  more  than  +/-$100K  or  +/-10%.    A  requirement  narrative  describing  the  PCN workload  is  required.    Also  required  is  an  impact  statement  that  provides  the  impact  to the mission if the requirement is not funded. 2.7.1.6.  Prioritization  attributes  can  be  file-maintained  for  each  PCN,  but  are  not required.   22 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 2.7.1.7.  If  applicable,  assign  an  associated  Performance  Based  Outcome  (PBO)  to  the PCN  to  further  justify  the  requirement.    PBO  development  is  accomplished  via  the Weapon System Agreement (WSA)/PBO module in CAFDEx™ in accordance with the PBO  Guidance  document  provided  on  the  CAM  EIS  Site  inside  the  PBO  and  WSA folder.  (https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx.) 2.8.  Coordination. 2.8.1.  Program Office – ALC/Business Operation (OB) Coordination.  The Program Office will  coordinate  all  organic  DM  correspondence  in  reference  to  the  following  items  or  any changes (through the year of execution) through the ALC Maintenance Group/OB to include: 2.8.1.1.  Initial  baselines  and  any  changes  to  that  baseline  that  reference  tail  numbers, sites, missiles and quantities. 2.8.1.2.  Flow  days  and  revisions  (reference  AFMCI  21-118,  Aircraft  Maintenance Production/Compression Report (AMREP)). 2.8.1.3.  AMR Brochure Hours by PCN (as published in CAFDEx™). 2.8.1.4.  AMR Work Spec - Tasks for work performed (as published in CAFDEx™). 2.8.1.5.  PDM Costs and/or DPEM rates published by HQ AFMC/FMR. 2.8.1.6.  In addition, the Program Office will inform the ALC Maintenance Group/OB of all face-to-face scheduling conferences, Video Teleconferences, Telecoms, etc., that will affect current and future funding and manpower for each weapon system during the year of execution. 2.9.  Aircraft Requirements. 2.9.1.  Funds Holder funds are used to support all depot-level maintenance requirements for aircraft in RGC A and B.  RGC A designates programmed requirements, i.e., those which are scheduled on a calendar/time cycle basis.  RGC B is used for field teams and unprogrammed maintenance, i.e., those requirements which generate unpredictably.   If a field team is used, RGC B organic rates and contract prices include labor costs only.  The owning unit will order required  material  against  its  local  Flying  Hour  Account.    For  additional  information  on RGCs, See Attachment 2 and AFI 21-102, Depot Maintenance Management. 2.9.2.  Aircraft  maintenance  such  as  defueling,  disarming,  and  flight  prep,  is  generally  paid for  by  the  Funds  Holder  who  funds  the  driving  workload.    Driving  workload  as  used  here simply  means  the  requirement  is  the  primary  reason  an  aircraft  is  scheduled  into  a  repair facility. 2.9.3.  PDM and ACI aircraft requirements will use DPEM customer funding under RGC A.  These requirements must be presented to and approved by the PM with coordination from the MAJCOM POC IAW paragraph 2.3.2. 2.9.4.  Airframe  Condition  Evaluation  and  On-Condition  Maintenance  for  rotary  winged aircraft are funded under DPEM RGC A. 2.9.5.  The  Pre-Induction  Inspection  (PII)  is  accomplished  months  before  the  aircraft  enters its  scheduled  DM.    This  will  provide  sufficient  lead  time  for  improving  the  real-time AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   23 maintenance requirements that establishes the known aircraft condition baseline.  This leads to  a  well-defined  maintenance  support  plan  for  the  submitted  depot  level  work  package.  Detailed  PII  instructions  are  documented  in  TO  00-25-4,  Depot  Maintenance  of  Aerospace Vehicles and Training Equipment. 2.9.6.  Maintenance Assist Requests, submitted according to AFTO 00-25-107, Maintenance Assistance, from the Customer for depot assistance are funded under RGC B.  The ALC may fulfill the requirement using a field team or by repairing the aircraft at a depot level facility. 2.9.7.  Negotiated  Organizational  and  Intermediate  level  aircraft  maintenance  performed  by depot-level personnel at the request of the user is a DPEM requirement.  This type of work must  be  negotiated  between  the  Customer,  Funds  Holders,  Lead  Command,  PM,  and  the SOR.    Organizational  and  Intermediate  level  maintenance  can  also  be  accomplished  via  an Air  Force  Technical  Order  (AFTO)  Form  103,  Aircraft/Missile  Condition  Data,  request certified by the MAJCOM as mission essential and beyond its current capability. 2.9.8.  The  aircraft  depot-level  modification  installation  is  funded  with  appropriation  3010, Budget Program (BP) 1100. 2.9.9.  Damage that is not due to reasonable wear and tear and exceeds $250,000 total repair cost is called aircraft damage  repair.  O&M funding pays to recover the aircraft to a flying condition.  Sust Eng Element of Expense/Investment Code (EEIC) 583 pays for engineering evaluations to determine the cause of the damage.  EEIC 583 is generally used for contract support only.  However, it is possible to use organic resources for this purpose, but the funds must first be realigned to AFEEIC 583OR; see Attachment 4 for a list of AFEEICs.  Chapter 12 has more information about Sust Eng.  DPEM requirement will be the cost of examining the  crashed/damaged  aircraft  by  contract  or  organic  depot-level  maintenance  personnel  to determine the cost of repair and to assemble a materials list.  The labor and material used to repair the aircraft is also a valid DPEM requirement. 2.10.  Missile Requirements. 2.10.1.  Requirements  in  RGCs  C  and  D  support  all  depot-level  maintenance  activities required  for  AF  missile  systems.    RGC  C  designates  programmed  requirements,  i.e.,  those that  are  scheduled  on  a  calendar/time  cycle  basis.    RGC  D  is  used  for  field  teams  and unprogrammed  maintenance.    If  a  field  team  is  used,  RGC  D  organic  rates  and  contract prices include labor costs only.  The owning unit will order required material against its local funds for: to  preserve 2.10.1.1.

Computed  Tomography  of  Intercontinental  Ballistic  Missile  (ICBM) rocket motors. 2.10.2.  Unprogrammed organic and contract maintenance requirements (i.e., RGC D) for the ICBM  weapon  system  are  generated  primarily  by  the  use  of  program  management, engineering assessments, and the historical trend of past year obligations, as well as known program  changes,  e.g.,  PDM  directions  or  the  Strategic  Arms  Reduction  Treaty  (START).  ICBM unprogrammed requirements may result from: 2.10.2.1.  A  deficiency  identified  by  one  of  the  Program  Offices  within  the  ICBM Program Group (e.g., Guidance, Propulsion, Re-entry, or Ground).  Once a deficiency is identified, an Integrated Product Team (IPT) must meet to develop a viable solution. 2.10.2.2.  A  risk  to  the  program  based  on  engineering  assessments  identified  by  the ICBM Chief Engineer. 2.10.2.3.

The PMS uses this spreadsheet to determine if the requirements  source  of  repair  is  either  contract  or  organic  and  the  quantity  and  time frequency  of  the  repair.    The  Programmed  DPEM  organic  and  contract  support requirements  (i.e.,  RGC  C)  are  computed  by  the  Secondary  Item  Requirements  System (D200A).    The  D200A  computes  requirements  for  buy,  repair,  and  termination  of recoverable  and  consumable  items  (reference  AFMCMAN  23-1,  Requirements  for Secondary Items (D200A/D200N).  After the requirements are computed, D200A passes repair  requirements  to  the  D075  Automated  Budget  Compilation  System  (ABCS); reference AFMCI 23-112, Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR). 2.10.3.  Emergency Response Teams for ICBM rocket motors and Propulsion System Rocket Engines  (PSRE)  have  been  deemed  not  valid  weapon  system  sustainment  or  depot-level maintenance activities per HQ AFMC/FMAP (Policy Division).  AF Global Strike Command AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   25 (AFGSC)  is  responsible  for  budgeting  and  funding  for  ICBM  Emergency  Response  Teams outside the WSS process, including: 2.10.3.1.  Hardness  Surveillance  Electronic  Pulse  Program  for  ICBM  Launch  facilities, and 2.10.3.2.  Static Fire performance testing for ICBM rocket motors and PSREs. 2.11.  Depot Schedule and Depot/Customer Workload Agreement (DCWA). 2.11.1.  DM Scheduling.  Scheduling is required to facilitate an effective use of resources in providing maximum weapon system availability to the warfighter. 2.11.2.  The Program Office, in conjunction with MAJCOMs, maintenance, and appropriate stakeholders,  will  develop  and  publish  an  official  schedule  annually  by  1  July  for  the  next execution  year  plus  draft  two-years  of  FYDP  (at  a  minimum)  aligned  with  the  approved AMR  Brochure.    The  intent  is  to  develop  the  official  baseline  schedule  by  tail  number, engineering requirement, quantity, or missile site. 2.11.2.1.  The core elements of a depot schedule will consist of the following: 2.11.2.1.1.  Tail Number/Missile/Sites/Quantity, 2.11.2.1.2.  Induction date, 2.11.2.1.3.  Target Completion Date, 2.11.2.1.4.  Flow days, and 2.11.2.1.5.  Program or Type of work (i.e., PDM, Mod, etc.). 2.11.2.2.  In  addition  to  the  core  elements,  the  optional  following  elements  provide increased value to the customer: 2.11.2.2.1.  Program Control Number (PCN), 2.11.2.2.2.  Owning Unit (Base), 2.11.2.2.3.  MDS, 2.11.2.2.4.  MAJCOM 2.11.2.2.5.  SOR, and 2.11.2.2.6.  Additional requirements as needed (i.e., ACI, etc.). 2.11.3.  The  purpose  of  the  DCWA  is  to  define  the  scope  of  work,  outline  specific requirements, and specify individual responsibilities for accomplishing organic pre- and post- depot level maintenance inductions/deliveries of all specific weapon systems at ALCs. 2.11.4.  Each  Program  Office  will  complete  a  DCWA  for  the  year  of  execution  for  organic DM  workload.    The  DCWA  requires  annual  coordination/signatures  by  the  PM  and equivalent  from  the  Lead  Command  and  Funds  Holder  MAJCOM/A4s  and  ALC Maintenance  Group  or  designated  representative.   All  ANG  aircraft  and  missile scheduling/DCWAs will be coordinated through NGB/A4P and NGB/A4M for signature. 2.11.5.  If all  parties agree not  to  use  a DCWA, a  memorandum  requesting  deviation from guidance  will  be  coordinated  and  signed  annually  by  the  designated  representatives  listed   26 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 above.    The  DCWA  or  the  memo  must  be  fully  signed  and  in  place  NLT  1  September  for each year it is used. 2.11.6.  The  Program  Office,  Maintenance  Group,  and  MAJCOM(s)  POC(s)  (on  behalf  of their respective units) will jointly agree on the DCWA.  The AMR Work Spec will be used as the basis for scheduled maintenance tasks  to  be accomplished,  whereas the AMR Brochure will be used as the basis for the scheduled maintenance sub-tasks and hours associated with each  weapon  system  in  the  agreement.    Each  Program  Office  and  ALC  local  operating instruction will provide guidance on format, title and schedule for the DCWA.  Copies of the DCWA or the letter of deviation will be provided to HQ AFMC/A4F (CAM) Workflow upon final approval/signature and will be provided to all applicable stakeholders. 2.11.6.1.  The DCWA will address at minimum the following elements: 2.11.6.1.1.  Assessment period, 2.11.6.1.2.  Flow days, 2.11.6.1.3.  Induction configuration, 2.11.6.1.4.  Key POCs, 2.11.6.1.5.  Period of performance, 2.11.6.1.6.  Purpose, 2.11.6.1.7.  Quality statement, 2.11.6.1.8.  Required documents or references, 2.11.6.1.9.  Duties and Task, 2.11.6.1.10.  Scope of work, 2.11.6.1.11.  Signature block(s)/with dates, 2.11.6.1.12.  Special instructions, and 2.11.6.1.13.  Warranties. 2.11.6.2.  No  deviations  will  be  made  from  the  negotiated  work  package,  support responsibilities,  and  other  agreements  without  the  prior  coordination  and  approval  from the Program Office, MAJCOM(s) POC(s), and ALC Maintenance Group. 2.12.  Fixed Price Worksheet (FPWS). 2.12.1.  The FPWS is used to document the agreement between the weapon system Program Office and the ALC Maintenance Group for each tail/serial numbered aircraft/missile system undergoing  organic  DM  and  other  tasks  performed  in  conjunction  with  DM.    The  FPWS applies  to  all  workloads,  including  3400-funded  sustainment,  3600-funded  development, 3010-  or  3020-funded  modifications,  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  or  other  direct  cite  and partnership workload.  Other tasks performed, such as MAJCOM specific requirements, are documented  on  the  FPWS  in  the  “Other  Negotiated  Maintenance”  and  “Scheduled  Mods, TCTOs, and Other Negotiated Maintenance (Other than 3400 Funded)” sections.  The FPWS shall include all tasks accomplished during DM that generate revenue for the complex.  The AFMC Standard FPWS template will be used (See attachment 6 for guidance). AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   27 2.12.1.1.  The FPWS is divided into the following four areas: 2.12.1.2.  Area 1, the FPWS Header.  This area is used to identify the tail/serial numbered aircraft/missile system undergoing organic DM and other applicable data. 2.12.1.3.  Area  2,  the  Planned  Depot  Work  (Fixed  Price  Area).    This  area  is  used  to document  the  three  elements  of  the  fixed  price:  basic,  options,  and  O&A.    This  area constitutes the fixed price area of the FPWS. 2.12.1.4.  Area 3, the Other Negotiated Maintenance (i.e. AFTO Form 103 items that are not  in  AMR).    This  area  is  used  to  document  any  maintenance  to  be  completed  during depot  and  not  included  in  the  AMR  Brochure  (AFTO  Form  103,  Unit  requested maintenance and/or inspections, etc.).  This area is not part of the fixed price, but must be listed for revenue tracking. 2.12.1.5.  Area  4,  the  Scheduled  Mods,  TCTOs,  and  Other  Negotiated  Maintenance (Other  than  3400  Funded.).    This  area  is  used  to  document  any  other  non-3400  funded work accomplished (Mods, TCTOs, FMS, etc.).  This area is not part of the fixed price, but must be listed for revenue tracking. 2.12.2.  The  FPWS  is  prepared  using  the  AMR  Brochure  for  the  respective  weapon  system by tail/serial numbered aircraft/missile.  There are two (2) FPWS: 2.12.2.1.  The  Initial  FPWS  will  be  developed  and  forwarded  by  the  weapon  system Program Office to HQ AFMC/A4F Workflow NLT 30 days prior to DM induction, and 2.12.2.2.  The  Final  FPWS  will  be  updated  with  approved  changes  to  include  approved Out of Cycle (OOC) requests and provided to HQ AFMC/A4F Workflow.  This should be  a  coordinated  effort  between  the  weapon  system  Program  Office  and  the  ALC Maintenance Group/OB after all work is completed. Note:  All changes between the Initial and Final FPWS will be coordinated and agreed to by the weapon system Program Office and the Maintenance Group. 2.12.3.  Calculation of Fixed Price:  Tasks performed during DM are a predetermined series of common DM tasks and tail/serial numbered aircraft/missile specific tasks for each aircraft, missile  or  other  major  end  item  undergoing  depot  level  maintenance.    Fixed  prices  are developed for each MDS and are comprised of three elements: basic, options, and O&A. 2.12.3.1.  The basic element of a fixed price is that price charged for each and every like aircraft,  missile,  or  item  undergoing  PDM,  regardless  of  condition,  for  a  predetermined series of common DM tasks.  The basic charge is computed by multiplying the number of DPSH by the occurrence factors and by the approved sales rates.  The tasks and number of  DPSH  are  determined  by  the  appropriate  planning/workload  activity,  but  must  be directly traceable to AMR tasks and hours.  Generally, tasks with 100 percent occurrence factors  are  included  in  the  basic  package.    However,  tasks  with  less  than  100% occurrence  factor  are  also  included.    The  per  cent  occurrence  factor  MUST  be  charged for each item undergoing PDM. 2.12.3.2.  Options  are  those  tasks  which  are  not  common  to  every  induction.    This element allows the customer and the depot to determine each price according to the needs of  the  end  item.    For  example,  a  modification  may  not  be  required  for  all  inductions.  Likewise, all aircraft may not require painting.  By identifying such tasks as options and   28 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 computing  a  price  for  each,  the  customer  is  provided  a  shopping  list  and  the  depot  is given  a  more  finite  AMR  Work  Spec.    In  most  cases,  the  price  for  each  option  is determined  by  multiplying  the  task  hours  (from  AMR  or  TCTO)  by  the  rates.    Note: Options are not the same as occurrence tasks. 2.12.3.3.  O&A  is  the  low  frequency  items  or  work    not  called  out  in  the  AMR  Work Spec,  PD  or  covered  under  economy  or  flight  safety  tasks  (see  definition  for  more details). These items of work will only be done to correct a critical or major deficiency and  must  be  approved  by  the  Project  Administration  Officer  or  the  PM  Representative.  This  is  documented  in  AFMCI  21-118.    Each  depot  package  will  include  a  standard number  of  trended  O&A  hours.    Unused  O&A  hours  can  be  moved  from  tail  to  tail  as needed, but only between the same MD/MDS and funds holder.  An OOC request must be used for O&A workload that meets the criteria for an OOC, (ref. Paragraph 14.2.1). 2.12.3.4.  Fixed price includes average AMR Brochure (earned) hours for the basic DM tasks, option tasks and O&A hours funded and billed at earned hours times the stabilized sales rate.  This  is  known as  standard cost.  If actual  cost is  above  or below this “fixed price”  standard  cost,  the  Working  Capital  Fund  (WCF)  earns  the  difference  or  takes  a loss between the actual and the fixed price. 2.12.4.  Billing is for average AMR Brochure (earned) hours times sales rate.  If it turns out that excess funding has occurred due to the Maintenance Group and Program Office agreeing to  change  the  requirement,  they  must  use  the  OOC  process  and  return  the  excess  funds  as soon  as  possible  prior  to  the  end  of  the  FY  with  the  estimate  of  the  remaining  work  to  be done by the Maintenance Group on this year’s inductions carried into the next FY. 2.12.4.1.  If  additional  funds  are  needed  to  cover  O&A  approved  tasks,  the  PM  request additional funding before the funds expire at the end of a fiscal year. 2.12.4.2.  In  the  year  of  execution,  if  unforeseen  tasks  are  identified  for  prior  year inductions  and  current  year  funding  is  requested  by  the  Maintenance  Group,  it  must  be for O&A tasks that are not part of the basic requirements. 2.12.4.3.  Depot workload carrying over to next FY.  Depot work that carries over from one  fiscal  year  to  another  requires  an  estimate  of  the  price  of  the  work  required  to  be carried over into the next fiscal year. 2.12.4.3.1.  Example:    FY12  workload  remaining,  which  carries  over  into  FY13, needs  to  be  priced.    This  estimate  will  be  given  to  the  Program  Office  so  that adequate FY12 funding can be provided.  Funding on open Job Order Numbers (JON) must be analyzed to ensure adequate funding for the FY12 work.  However, it is the acceptance  and  obligation  of  funding  documents  (Customer  Order  Numbers-CONs) that determine the funding actually available for carryover. 2.13.  Supporting Guidance. 2.13.1.  Weapon  system  engineers  are  required  to  comply  with  the  policy  guidance  for  the Analytical Condition Inspection (ACI), Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM), Controlled Interval Extension (CIE), and Aircraft Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) programs.  Policy and  procedures  for  these  programs  are  discussed  below.    Their  status  is  briefed  to  the  PM during the annual review. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   29 2.13.1.1.  AFMCI  21-102,  Analytical  Condition  Inspection  (ACI)  Programs,  provides guidance  and  procedures  for  establishing  and  monitoring  ACI  programs  for  aerospace equipment.    By  definition,  ACI  programs  are  established  to  reveal  defects  that  may  not otherwise  be  detected  through  normal  TO  and  PDM  inspections.    These  programs provide  data  for  engineering  and  technical  evaluations  of  the  relative  condition  of  the total  MDS  and  aircraft  force.    Data  generated  from  ACIs  is  used  to  refine  or  create mandatory aircraft inspection programs (e.g., field and depot programs). 2.13.1.2.  The  PM may include any item or area in the ACI program for a weapon system and  develops  a  sampling  plan  before  the  start  of  an  ACI  program.    AFMCI  21-102 contains  the  plan  requirements  and  methodology  for  determining  sample  sizes.    Results from  ASIP,  failure  data,  Deficiency  Reports  (DR),  and  accident  reports  are  the  primary sources for determining such items or areas requiring inspection and evaluation.  An ACI is  normally  accomplished  concurrently  with  modification  and/or  PDM  program requirements. 2.13.1.3.  The  weapon  system  engineers  determine  when  an  ACI  program  is  not necessary.    AFMCI  21-102  provides  guidance  as  to  when  an  ACI  program  should  be initiated.    Deviations  to  this  guidance  are  documented  in  the  AMR  Brochure.    The weapon  system  engineers  also  prepare  ACI  task  proposals  IAW  ERRP  and  determine ACI  groupings  and  quantities  for  review  and  approval  by  the  PM.    The  PM  along  with coordination  from  the  Lead  MAJCOM  POC,  is  the  authority  for  extensions  to  the approved ACI program.  Note: Refer to AFMCI 21-102 for additional information. 2.13.2.  AFMCI  21-103,  Reliability-Centered  Maintenance  (RCM)  Programs,  provides guidance  and  procedures  for  establishing  and  monitoring  preventive  maintenance  programs for aerospace equipment using RCM methodology.  By definition, RCM analysis is used to develop scheduled inspection and maintenance requirements. 2.13.3.  The required procedures for a system analysis program consist of the following: 2.13.3.1.  A  Failure  Modes,  Effects,  and  Criticality  Analysis  (FMECA)  of  significant structures, systems, assemblies, and items; 2.13.3.2.  A decision logic analysis that guides the analyst through a screening process to establish  maintenance  requirements  based  on  known  or  probable  failure  modes  and effects.    This  procedure  is  contained  in  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation  Federal Aviation  Administration  Advisory  Circular  121-22C,  chapter  2,  Air  Transport Association Maintenance Steering Group Document 3, and AFMCI 21-103; 2.13.3.3.  A  frequency  determination  to  select  the  best  inspection  and  maintenance interval requirement; 2.13.3.4.  A  periodic  assessment  of  individual  inspection  requirements  and  intervals  to evaluate basic maintenance concepts (e.g., phase versus periodic) and program intervals (e.g., 50-hour phase versus 100-hour phase); and 2.13.3.5.  Proper documentation of all of the foregoing analyses and assessments. initiating  new  developments  or 2.13.4.  AFMCI  21-103 modifications to develop the initial inspection and maintenance requirements based on RCM analysis, unless a waiver has been granted by HQ United States AF (USAF).  AFMCI 21-103 requires  an  organization   30 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 also requires the PM to assess systems and equipment inspection requirements at least every two  years.    For  operational  systems  with  extensive  maintenance  histories  and  structured programs, reassessment does not have to involve a specific RCM decision logic analysis. 2.13.4.1.  The RCM process reveals requirements for potential PDM and ACI tasks.  All PDM and ACI tasks must be defined, justified, and submitted to the PM for approval. 2.13.5.  AFMCI  21-104,  Controlled  Interval  Extension  (CIE)  Programs,  provides  guidance and procedures for establishing and monitoring CIE programs for aerospace equipment.  By definition, CIE programs are established to control conditions for extending maintenance and inspection intervals without sacrificing safety of flight or reliability. 2.13.5.1.  PDM  intervals  are  determined  by  evaluating  aircraft  safety,  reliability,  and mission  requirements.    TO  00-25-4  delineates  the  technique  used  to  determine  the appropriate CIE sample size based on the force size of the  MDS being  evaluated under the CIE programs. 2.13.5.2.  Refer  to  AFMCI  21-104  for  additional  information  and  sample  sizes.    A  CIE program is not required for a force of 36 aircraft or less. 2.13.5.3.  The weapon system engineers set up and monitor all required CIE programs for the assigned aircraft.  The PM and Lead MAJCOM POC oversee all CIE programs, and review  results  from  existing  programs  and  all  new  proposals.    The  PM  and  Lead MAJCOM  POC  also  evaluate  weapon  system  engineer  requests  for  deviations  from sample size requirements. 2.13.6.  The  ASIP  program  establishes  a  timed-phased  set  of  required  actions  to  be performed  at  optimum  times  during  the  life  cycle  (i.e.,  design  through  phase-out)  of  an aircraft  system  to  ensure  the  structural  integrity  (e.g.,  strength,  rigidity,  damage  tolerance, durability,  and  service  life  capability)  of  the  aircraft.    (Reference  AFPD  63-1/20-1, Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management,  AFI  63-140,  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity  Program, Military  Handbook  (MIL-HDBK)  1530C,  DoD  Standard  Practice:  Aircraft  Structural Integrity Program (ASIP) for additional guidance on the ASIP program.) AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   31 Chapter 3 THE AMR ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS REVIEW PROCESS (ERRP) 3.1.  Background. 3.1.1.  The ERRP was developed in order to document a standardized methodology to fully define,  develop,  and  approve  a  requirement  that  ensures  scheduled  maintenance  tasks  are valid  with  supportability  elements  identified  upfront;  the  goal  being  a  supportable maintenance task that can be performed as scheduled. 3.2.  Summary Point. 3.2.1.  The ERRP is used to transition a proposed requirement into a scheduled maintenance task.  The ERRP directly supports the DPEM AMR process and is applicable to aircraft and missile  assets  belonging  to  the  active  AF,  NGB,  AFRC  and  AF  RDT&E.    It  drives  the generation of a new engineering requirement from conception through approval by providing justification with fully developed supportability elements.  In addition, the process directs a review of existing scheduled maintenance tasks for validity. 3.3.  Detailed Discussion. 3.3.1.  The  purpose  of  this  chapter  is  to  outline  the  process  to  approve  a  scheduled maintenance  depot  requirement.    In  this  process,  a  requirement  will  move  from  a  proposed (new  or  existing)  requirement,  then  pass  through  the  requirements  definition  stages  and finally  to  an  approved  requirement.    Once  an  Engineering  Requirements  DEV  PAC  is approved  by  the  Chief  Engineer,  it  will  go  to  the  BOW  and  Requirements  Supportability Processes.  The current DEV PAC Template is located on the CAM EIS Site under General information:https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx 3.4.  Scope (Start to End Point). 3.4.1.  Process  Scope:    The  action  that  will  trigger  this  process  is  the  identification  of  a technical  issue  requiring  an  engineering  resolution;  i.e.,  a  scheduled  maintenance  task  that needs to be performed on a weapon system.  For the purpose of this process, a scheduled DM requirement  is  defined  as  a  maintenance  action  or  group  of  maintenance  actions,  supported by  engineering  analysis,  from  which  overall  supportability  can  be  determined.    The scheduled maintenance task could be accomplished at a depot or contract facility.  A defined scheduled  maintenance  requirement  is  comprised  of  the  following  elements:    step-by-step work procedures, parts listings, “non-parts” listing, Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT), special tools,  Personal  Protective  Equipment  (PPE),  support  equipment,  production  skills,  and facilities needed to perform the task. 3.4.2.  Applicability:    ERRP  applies  to  all  proposed  scheduled  depot  level  aircraft/missile maintenance requirements (new, amended or deleted) and standardizes the development of an accurate  and  completely  defined  requirement  before  presenting  it  to  the  Weapon  System Chief Engineer for approval.  This process addresses the three parts of a requirement in the DEV PAC: 3.4.2.1.  DEV PAC, PART I (Proposed Engineering Requirement) – Proposed scheduled maintenance requirement is generated from analysis, field request, policy, etc.   32 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 3.4.2.2.  DEV PAC, PART II (Defined Engineering Requirement) – Proposed scheduled maintenance  requirement  is  fully  defined,  with  step-by-step  instructions,  parts  and materiel, tools, HAZMAT, etc.  Note:  Technical data/drawings must exist at this stage, or there must be an electronic AF Form AFTO 252 in process requesting a change to the technical data/drawing. 3.4.3.  DEV PAC, PART III (Approved/Disapproved Engineering Requirement).  The Chief Engineer  must  approve  a  defined  requirement  for  it  to  transition  into  a  scheduled maintenance  task.    It  will  then  advance  to  the  BOW  and  Requirements  Supportability processes. 3.5.  Duties and Task:  Maintenance Complex. 3.5.1.  Requirements  Definition  Team:    This  team  is  comprised  of  Program  Office Engineering  and  Equipment  Specialists.    The  team  will  document  a  proposed  requirement (new,  amended  or  deleted),  and  take  the  necessary  actions  to  receive  approval  to  further develop the requirement to gain approval from the Chief Engineer.  For existing tasks that are under  review,  full  DEV  PACs  are  required.    Standard  aircraft  handling  maintenance  tasks (towing,  jacking,  safe  for  maintenance,  etc.)  do  not  need  to  be  defined  in  an  engineering DEV PAC, PART I first-level review but do require supportability analysis consideration in the development of the engineering requirement review process in DEV PAC, PART II. 3.5.2.  Program  Office:    The  PM  or  designee,  with  input  from  Maintenance  Complex,  will determine which current/existing tasks will be included in the ERRP. 3.5.3.  Collaborative  Functional  Team:    This  team  is  responsible  for  developing  a  fully defined engineering scheduled maintenance requirement utilizing the DEV PAC.  This team consists  of  the  following  members:    Program  Office  (Engineering,  Equipment  Specialists, Logistics  Specialists,  PMS,  and  AMR  Lead),  Maintenance  Production  Specialists  (Aircraft Mechanics,  Production/Process  Engineering)  and  Industrial  Engineering  Technicians  (i.e., Planners).  The Supply Chain Specialists from the 448 Supply Chain Management Wing (448 SCMW) and DLA may also be brought in if needed.   Appointed  by 3.5.4.  ERR  Manager: the  ERR  Manager  oversees  and manages/facilitates  the  ERR  Process.    The  ERR  Manager  coordinates  with  the  Program Office,  Production  Management  and  Maintenance  Managers  to  ensure  a  thorough review/validation  effort  takes  place  to  select  and  prioritize  tasks  for  review.    The  ERR Manager: the  PM, 3.5.4.1.  Receives and documents the proposed requirement; 3.5.4.2.  Plans, schedules and tracks a 20% review of completed DEV PACs annually that totals a 100% review of the completed DEV PACs in a 5-year period.  The ERR Manager will provide AFMC/CAM with a list of completed DEV PACs annually; 3.5.4.3.  Coordinates  the  Requirements  Review  Board  (RRB)  (chaired  by  the  Chief Engineer) for the defined requirement; 3.5.4.4.  Documents the final action and outcome from the RRB (approved requirement, rework, on hold, monitor or disapproved); and 3.5.4.5.  Performs  follow-ups  on  any  issues  the  BOW  or  Requirements  Supportability teams may have with the scheduled maintenance task.   Note:  The ERR Manager is the AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   33 gatekeeper revisions/updates/and changes for configuration control. to  maintain/coordinate/facilitate  corrective  actions for  DEV  PAC 3.5.5.  The PM has overall responsibility for the ERRP. 3.5.6.  Program  Office  Engineer:    Populates  the  proposed  requirements  data  fields  and elements  on  the  DEV  PAC,  PART  I,  blocks  1  thru  25.    Leads  collaborative  meeting discussion on SOW/TO/TCTO procedures, and briefs what is included in the DEV PAC data fields  and  LOMs.    The  DEV  PAC,  including  the  LOM,  must  be  completed  for  all  tasks, including inspection tasks. 3.5.7.  Program  Office  Equipment  Specialist:    Works  in  conjunction  with  the  Engineer  to populate the requirements data fields and elements on the DEV PAC, PART I, blocks 1 thru 25. Also  includes  assisting  the  Engineer  with  the  collaborative  meeting  discussion  onSOW/TO/TCTO procedures, and brief what is included in the LOMs. 3.5.8.  Program Office Logistics Specialist:  Evaluates the new or updated task materiel list to perform  an  initial  assessment  of  availability  and  identify  long  lead  items.    This  assessment may  be  accomplished  during  or  immediately  after  the  Program  Office  Engineer/Equipment Specialist has developed the LOM required to accomplish the task. 3.5.9.  DLA/448  SCMW:    Based  on  the  task  list  materiel  information  available,  DLA  and 448 SCMW will make an initial assessment on asset availability to assist the Program Office in determining the year of planned task execution.  (T-1)  IAW AFMCI 23-205, Planning for DLA  Managed  Consumables  (PDMC)  Section  3.2.4.2,  the  Program  Office  will  ensure  that the  appropriate  PDMC  trigger  code  is  used  to  forecast  materiel  when  there  is  a  significant change  in  future  requirements  for  a  DLA  managed  consumable  item.    This  review corresponds to the 20% review of items identified in Paragraph 3.4.4.2. 3.5.10.  DM:    Maintenance  Planners  will  validate  DPSH  on  20%  of  the  existing  scheduled DM tasks annually.  This validation will occur concurrently with the ERRP development and review of the DEV PACs for existing tasks selected in Paragraph 3.5.4.2. 3.6.  Engineering Requirements Review (ERR) Process.

DEV PAC, Part I – Proposed Requirements. 3.7.1.  Definition:  Cognizant Program Office engineer completes Part I of the DEV PAC. 3.7.2.  Notification:    The  Cognizant  Program  Office  engineer  notifies  the  ERR  Manager  of the  locally approved database. 3.7.3.  DEV  PAC,  Part  I  Approval:    First  level  Program  Office  engineering  supervisor  (or level  as  delegated  by  the  Chief  Engineer)  approves  the  Part  I  requirements  definition  to determine  if  proceeding  to  the  DEV  PAC,  Part  II.    If  approved,  the  supervisor  assigns  a Project  Engineer  (may  be  same  as  Cognizant  Engineer)  who  will  develop  tech  data,  if required, and support the collaborative functional team in  DEV PAC, Part II to continue to fully define the proposed requirement.  If requires further justification, return to originator of the proposed requirement.  If disapproved, first level supervisor must provide justification for disapproval to the ERR manager for documentation. 3.8.  DEV PAC, Part II – Defined Requirement. 3.8.1.  Definition:   The  Project  Engineer,  with  support  from  the  Program  Office  equipment specialist, will develop the work procedures and generate the draft technical data using Part II (LOMs) of the DEV PAC.  Note:  The creation of a defined requirement may not require input from a Program Office engineer for every instance.  For example, if published technical data  already  exist  for  the  task  in  question,  it  is  assumed  a  Cognizant  Equipment  Specialist can initiate creation of the technical data for the requirement. 3.8.2.  Notification:    The  Project  Engineer  will  notify  the  ERR  manager  when  the  draft technical  data  is  completed  for  a  requirement.    The  ERR  manager  will  arrange  a Collaborative  Requirements  Review  Team  meeting  for  review  once  Part  I,  the  1st  level review, and the initial draft of LOMs has been completed. 3.8.3.  Collaborative  Requirement  Review:    The  Collaborative  Requirement  Review  is conducted with the Assigned Project Engineer and the Collaborative Functional Team.  This review assists in the population of Part II of the DEV PAC. 3.8.3.1.  Technical  Data  Walk-Through:    The  Program  Office  engineer  and  equipment specialist will “walk” the collaborative team through the draft technical data step by step.  A validation/verification (VAL/VER) shall be required for every task being considered in the  ERRP.    The  Collaborative  Requirements  Review  Team  shall  determine  the appropriate  scope  for  a  VAL/VER  in  order  to  accomplish  the  workload  (i.e.,  table-top VAL/VER,  on-aircraft  VAL/VER  to  ensure  form,  fit  and  function,  etc.).    This recommendation shall be documented and justified to the Chief Engineer.   36 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 3.8.3.2.  Technical  Risk  Assessment:    The  collaborative  team  review  shall  identify  and assess  the  risk  level  associated  with  executing  the  task.    Risk  areas  to  consider  could include  the  following:    Lack  of  critical  skills;  lack  of  critical  technology;  lack  of experience with the work to be performed (this could include issues such as unfamiliarity with  the  procedures  or  removing  a  panel  for  the  first  time),  training,  facility constraints (this  could  include  limitations  such  as  overhead  hoists,  fuel  safe  hangars,  etc.),  and Environment, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) risks. 3.8.3.3.  High Technical Risk:  For those tasks designated high technical risk (Block 31h of  DEV  PAC,  Part  II)  to  execute,  a  risk  mitigation  plan  shall  be  developed  using  the methodology and approach outlined in the current version of the Risk Management Guide for DoD Acquisition.  Additionally, high risk tasks shall always require a prototype on an aircraft.  Justification for not prototyping the high risk mitigation strategy must be fully documented  and  approved  by  the  PM.  (Note:    Risk  mitigation  plans  may  include prototyping or verifying the task on a non-production aircraft.  Identification of alternate parts,  suitable  substitutes,  or  qualifying  additional  sources  of  supply  may  also  be considered.    To  address  facility  concerns/constraints,  task  complexity  issues,  or  aircraft availability issues, prototyping may be accomplished at the AMARG). 3.8.3.4.  Revisions:  Required revisions to the technical data may be identified during the course  of the Collaborative Requirement Review.  Revisions  may also occur during the performance of the risk mitigation plan.  Regardless of when or where the technical data revisions  are  identified,  the  ERR  Manager  must  forward  the  revisions  to  the  Project Engineer and Program Office equipment specialist for re-work and resolution (Paragraph 3.8.1).  Another Collaborative Requirement Review may be reconvened upon completion of the re-work. 3.8.3.5.  Initial Parts Assessment (Part II, DEV PAC):  When evaluating demand history for parts, the team shall list all parts necessary to accomplish the task (stock listed & non-stock  listed);  the  team  should  also  consider  demand  history  and  work-around(s)  when reviewing these parts.  If demand history warrants (IAW AFI 23-101, Air Force Materiel Management,  AFMAN  23-122,  Materiel  Management  Procedures,  AFH  23-123, Materiel Management Reference), a stock listing action will be required. 3.8.3.6.  For  Non-parts  supportability  (PPE,  support  equipment,  HAZMAT,  special equipment, special tools, etc.), the determination is made by the collaborative team. 3.9.  DEV PAC, Part III – Approved Requirement. 3.9.1.  Notification:  The ERR Manager will schedule a Requirements Review Board (RRB) chaired  by  the  Chief  Engineer.    Attendees  will  be  assigned  by  the  Project  Engineer responsible for the requirements under review; this may include the Collaborative Functional Team. 3.9.2.  Outcomes:  After reviewing the requirement, the Chief Engineer will decide on one of four paths: 3.9.2.1.  Requirement approved: 3.9.2.1.1.  Chief Engineer approves the requirement. 3.9.2.1.2.  ERR Manager Documents the approval in a locally approved database. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   37 3.9.2.1.3.  Program  Office  provides  the  DEV  PAC  to  DM.    (Ref.  Attachment  5  for DEV PAC) 3.9.2.1.4.  Program  Office  file  maintains/updates  the  AMR  Work  Spec  and  AMR Brochure. 3.9.3.  Requirement  disapproved:    Reasons  for  disapproval  are  documented  by  the  ERR manager. 3.9.3.1.  Requirement returned for re-work:  Project Engineer reworks the analysis or tech data based upon the Chief Engineer’s direction and document reason for return. 3.9.3.2.  Requirement  deleted  or  archived:    If  at  any  time  the  Engineer  or  Equipment Specialist  determines  an  existing  task  should  be  deleted  or  reduced  a  collaborative meeting must take place.  The Chief Engineer RRB approves the change. 3.9.4.  Requirements  Process  Metrics:    Process  metrics  shall  be  identified  by  the  PM  to measure the performance of the ERR process. 3.9.4.1.  Each  ALC  shall  report  the  number  of  ERRP  requirements  initiated  and completed  (all  stages)  DEV  PAC  compared  to  number  of  total  requirements  (both existing and new).  Such reports shall be made quarterly to HQ AFMC via the CAM EIS ERRP  Performance  Metrics  folder  and  during  any  Face-to-Face  reviews.    (T-1)    There are  3  ALC  folders  located  on  the  CAM  EIS  site  for  quarterly  performance  reporting: https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2fcs%2fcam%2fCAM%20Document%20Library%2fERRP%20Performance%20Metrics&FolderCTID=&View=%7b8260E44E%2dBF5A%2d4024%2d87C5%2d2E5E50A0ECAF%7d 3.9.4.2.  The Local Operating Instruction (OI) will be used to define format and content of lower level metrics to measure the performance of the ERR Process. 3.9.5.  Continuous Process Improvement:  A Root Cause Analysis (RCA) will be initiated by the ERR manager in conjunction with the Chief Engineer for the metrics cited in Paragraph 3.9.4.1.   38 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 4 THE AMR BILL OF WORK (BOW) PROCESS 4.1.  Overview. 4.1.1.  The process outlined for the Program Office to add, delete, and amend DM tasks is the BOW for aircraft and missile systems.  The BOW process identifies the operations required to  execute  tasks  that  are  approved in  the  ERRP  and  calculates  the  manhours  to  support  the AMR Brochure. 4.2.  Summary Point. 4.2.1.  This  process  directly  supports  the  DPEM  AMR  process  and  is  applicable  to  aircraft and missile assets belonging to the active AF, NGB, AFRC and AF RDT&E.  Each complex may  develop  a  local  operating  instruction  to  address  specific  roles  and  responsibilities  to comply with the BOW Process. 4.3.  Detailed Discussion. 4.3.1.  The BOW process utilizes the Engineering Requirements DEV PAC from the ERRP process  to  update  materiel  data  systems  to  include  new,  amended,  or  deleted  scheduled organic DM tasks contained in the AMR Work Spec and AMR Brochure with the following elements:    step-by-step  work  procedures,  parts  listings,  hazardous  materials,  special  tools, PPE, common tools (if utilizing task kits), support equipment and production skills needed to perform  the  task.   Additionally,  it  includes  the  Creating/Modifying  aircraft/missile maintenance network (i.e., Major Jobs) which includes end-to-end sequencing (critical path) of  all  scheduled  DM  tasks,  conversion  of  the  step-by-step  work  procedures  for  input  into Program  PDMSS the tasks, manhours/priceout  to update direct and indirect materiel lists. to  accomplish  scheduled  DM to include  calculating 4.4.  Duties and Task. 4.4.1.  The Program Office will provide the DEV PAC to the DM to begin the BOW process.  The Program Office also manages the master list of supportability elements and updates any changes identified in the DEV PACs.  The master list is then sent by the Program Office to the  applicable  sources  of  supply/repair  to  facilitate  supportability  assessments  identified  in Chapter 5. 4.4.2.  DM  (strategic)  Planners  ensure  the  step-by-step  operations  required  to  accomplish  a given  task  will  include:    Inspection/Predecessor/Successor  ops,  Gain  access,  Close-up,  etc., and  calculation  of  the  manhours/priceout  for  scheduled  maintenance  tasks  to  support  the AMR Brochure. 4.5.  BOW Criteria: 4.5.1.  The  core  elements  identified  in  Table  4.1.  are  used  to  provide  an  accurate  and  well defined requirement to update the AMR Work Spec/AMR Brochure prior to publishing. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   39 Table 4.1.

Overview. 5.1.1.  This  chapter  outlines  the  process  for  the  Program  Office  (in  conjunction  with  other supportability  stakeholders)  to  conduct  overall  supportability  throughout  the  requirements process.  The requirements supportability process identifies Duties/Task and process steps to ensure  the  scheduled  maintenance  tasks  in  the  AMR  Work  Spec  and  AMR  Brochure  are supportable using the supportability elements identified in the ERRP.  This applies to all AF organizations  requiring  and  providing  scheduled  Aircraft  and  Missile  organic  DM  on  AF Systems. 5.2.  Summary Point. 5.2.1.  This  process  directly  supports  the  DPEM  AMR  process  and  is  applicable  to  aircraft and missile assets belonging to the active AF, NGB, AFRC and AF RDT&E. 5.3.  Detailed Discussion. 5.3.1.  The  requirements  supportability  process  reviews  and  assesses  the  level  of  risk associated to the execution of a scheduled maintenance task in the AMR Work Spec, AMR Brochure,  or  BOW.    Task  level  risk  is  determined  by  the  Program  Office  based  on  the individual  risk  assessments  provided  by  the  supply  chain  managers  and  maintenance personnel  for  their  assigned  supportability  elements  (parts/non-parts).    Inputs  to  the supportability  process  are  the  LOM  developed  through  the  ERRP  and  BOW,  as  well  as maintenance data on existing tasks that have yet to be reviewed through the ERRP. 5.3.2.  Supportability  Timeframes    and  definitions/criteria:    There  are  three  intervals  of supportability definitions/criteria for the overarching requirements process.  Based on Table 5.1., the Program Office will assess overall task supportability to determine if further actions are necessary. Table 5.1.  Strategic Supportability Assessment Criteria.

Strategic Supportability:  Occurs 18 months prior to aircraft input into the depot through  Fiscal  Year  Defense  Plan  (FYDP).    At  a  minimum  the  Strategic  Supportability Risk Assessment reviews will occur twice annually  for all scheduled maintenance tasks for  a  particular  Mission  Design  (MD)/MDS  (i.e.,  is  not  tail  or  serial  number  specific).  The refreshed risk assessment data is reported and used to support the AMR Work Spec review/collaboration; this is in preparation of the start of the new Fiscal Year.  (Paragraph 5.4. covers Strategic Supportability.) 5.3.1.2.  Operational Supportability:  Occurs 17 months – 31 days  prior to aircraft input into  the  depot  or  JON  is  opened  (ability  to  submit  the  first  requisition).    Based  on  the operational  tail/serial  number  (as  applicable)  assumes  all  identified  supportability elements  are/or  will  be available  31  days  prior  to  task  execution  schedule.    Operational Supportability  Assessment reviews will occur  in conjunction with  the strategic reviews; refreshed  risk  assessment  data  reporting  is  to  be  aligned  with  strategic  supportability.  (Ref. Paragraph 5.5 on Operation Supportability.) 5.3.1.3.  Tactical  Supportability:   Occurs when the JON is  opened  (ability to  submit the first  requisition)  prior  to  or  upon  aircraft/missile  induction  through  production  date  or closure  of  the  JON  (whichever  is  later).    The  task  review  is  based  on  availability  of supportability elements (parts and non-parts) to meet task execution schedule (Paragraph 5.6 covers Tactical Supportability). 5.3.2.  Supportability  Elements:    The  elements  to  be  reviewed  for  supportability  are:    1) Parts:  includes  AF  Sustainment  Center  (448  SCMW)  managed,  DLA  managed  to  include General  Support  Division  (GSD),  Industrial  Prime  Vendor  (IPV),  Local  Purchased,  and Local Manufactured; and  2) Non-Parts Support Equipment, Special Tools, Common Tools, PPE,  HAZMAT,  Manpower/skills,  and  Facilities/utilities.    Inputs  and  outputs  are  provided for each element and type of supportability assessment/review. 5.4.  Strategic Supportability. 5.4.1.  Duties/Task. 5.4.1.1.

Actively  manages  the  strategic  supportability  processes outlined  herein  and  serves  as  the  overall  Supportability  Chair,  with  reach  back  to  the responsible  organization  for  the  supportability  elements.    The  Program  Office  leads  the strategic  supportability  assessments/reviews.    The  goal  of  these  assessments/reviews  is continuous availability of all supportability elements identified in Paragraph 5.4.2.  The Program Office will utilize the Element and Task level color code assessment as part of the  review  and  analysis.    The  template  is  located  on  the  CAM  EIS  Site  under  General information:  (https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx). 5.4.1.2.  The template provides non-parts information for new tasks (identified during the ERRP)  and  existing  tasks  directly  to  DM.    It  also  provides  parts  information  for  new tasks  (identified  during  the  ERRP)  and  existing  tasks  directly  to  AFSC  P&E  and  DLA Aviation  P&S  organizations.    The  Program  Office  will  receive  information  back  from 448 SCMW, DLA and DM to summarize and assess risk at the task level.  Any changes to  the  validated  AMR  Work  Spec  must  be  communicated  to  448  SCMW  and  DLA  for parts and DM for non-parts.  To support parts forecasting, the Program Office provides changes  from  the  previous  year’s  submission  for  448  SCMW  managed  parts requirements  at  publishing  of  the  AMR  Brochure  (in  accordance  with  the  applicable published LRDP schedule) annually for inclusion into the D200A system.  The Program Office  will  also  provide  changes  from  the  previous  year’s  submission  of  the aircraft/missile  DLA  managed  items  to  448  SCMW  (Planning  for  DLA  Managed Consumables  (PDMC))  at  publishing  of  the  AMR  Brochure  (in  accordance  with  the applicable published LRDP schedule) annually for inclusion into the DLA demand plan.  The Program Office will provide changes from the previous year’s submission directly to the  aircraft/missile  DLA  managed  items  to  AFSC  PDMC)  at  publishing  of  the  AMR Brochure  (in  accordance  with  the  applicable  published  LRDP  schedule)  annually  for inclusion  into  the  DLA  demand  plan.

Overview. 6.1.1.  This  chapter  defines  DPEM  Engine  Maintenance  Requirements  utilizing  the  Whole Engine  Repair  Requirements  (WERR)  process,  which  facilitates  the  development  of  the Engine DPEM AMR Brochure. 6.1.2.  The WERR process is the tool used to identify, review, program, budget, and execute whole  engine  repair  requirements.    The  process  is  an  integral  part  of  the  DM  financial program and complies with its policies, products, and procedures. 6.1.3.  The  AFLCMC/LPS  Engine  Inventory  Manager  (EIM)  and  MAJCOM  engine managers  develop  the  requirements  using  input  data  from  such  products  as  the  Propulsion Requirements  System  (PRS),  Aerospace  Engine  Life  (AEL),  approved  AF/A3  peacetime flying hour program, and other products necessary to complete the computation. 6.1.3.1.  HQ  USAF/Deputy  Chief  of  Staff,  Logistics,  Installations,  and  Mission  Support (AF/A4), Directorate of Maintenance (AF/A4M) is the WERR process owner. 6.1.3.2.  The Director of Propulsion, in conjunction with HQ AFMC/A4F, is the process coordinator. 6.1.3.3.  Other  process  members  include  MAJCOM  customers  of  the  CSAG-M  who require engine DM. 6.1.4.  The  Engine  AMR  Work  Spec  Review  establishes  the  minimum  work  requirements needed to return an engine to a serviceable condition. 6.1.5.  The EIM for a given engine develops engine narratives and variances that are used in the DPEM module. 6.1.6.  AFMAN  20-116,  Propulsion  Life  Cycle  Management  for  Aerial  Vehicles,  and  its supplements describe the policy and procedures governing the computation and negotiation of whole engine repair requirements. 6.1.6.1.  EIMs use the Engine/Overhaul Requirement Computation Worksheet to project the quantity of engines to be repaired or output by the depot, organic or contract. 6.1.6.2.  EIMs and Command Engine Managers shall conduct engine repair negotiations each  winter  to  discuss  and  reconcile  any  differences  concerning  ALC  and  MAJCOM computed  engine  repair  numbers.    The  Engine  Overhaul  Negotiation  Summary documents the agreed Input/Output Requirement (i.e., engines and funding). 6.1.7.  Programmed  organic  engine  workload  is  executed  via  direct  cite  between  the  funds holder  and  repair  activity,  which  operates  under  the  CSAG-M  of  the  AF  Working  Capital Fund (AFWCF). 6.1.8.  The Engine/Overhaul Computation Worksheet documents the computed whole engine output repair requirements and inputs used in the output computation process.   52 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 6.1.9.  The  Engine  Overhaul  Negotiation  Summary  documents  engine  depot  overhaul requirements  negotiated  by  the  ALCs  and  MAJCOMs,  and  is  used  to  establish  funding levels. 6.2.  General Information. 6.2.1.    (Relationship  of  the  WERR  Process  to  the  DPEM  processes).  The  DPEM  Process exists to ensure DM budgets are properly sized to finance mission-essential requirements.  In order  to  defend  a  POM  or  Budget  Estimate  Submission  (BES)  submission,  ALC,  and MAJCOM  Program  Managers  collect  a  variety  of  supporting  information.    Support information  includes  a  description  of  the  requirement,  the  force  structure  on  which  it  is based,  how  it  is  computed,  how  it  is  priced,  why  it  is  needed,  when  and  how  it  will  be accomplished,  and  how  it  changes  from  year-to-year.    They  assemble  this  information  for many  different  commodities,  each  of  which  has  its  own  way  of  doing  business.    For budgeting, the commodities are organized into eight commodity groups.  Engines are one of these commodity groups. 6.2.2.  The  WERR  process  interfaces  with  the  DPEM  process  to  define  financial requirements  data  in  a  timely  manner.    The  DPEM  process  provides  and  uses  the  DPEM module via the web enabled CAFDEx™ system to facilitate this action.  These tools permit requirement data to have a high degree of consistency in both format and content among the various  commodities.    They  also  encourage  each  contributing  process  to  translate  its narratives into the language used by program and budget analysts at ALCs, MAJCOMs, Air Staff, OSD, the Office of Management and Budget, and Congress. 6.2.3.  Engine  Requirements  Determination.    Policy  and  procedures  for  the  whole  engine in  AFI  20-115  Propulsion repair  requirements  computation/negotiation  are  found Management for Aerial Vehicles, AFMAN 20-116, and their supplements. 6.2.4.  Initial Requirements Computation. 6.2.4.1.  ALC Repair Quantity Computation .  ALC Engine Managers use the calculation on the Engine/Overhaul Requirement Computation Worksheet to compute the quantity of engines that are projected to be repaired or output by the depot, organic or contract, in a given  quarter  to  support  the  unit’s  flying  hour  program.    The  Computation  reflects  the output  requirement  by  quarter  for  up  to  two  years,  and  annually  thereafter,  for  five additional  years.    Detailed  instructions  are  outlined  in  AFMAN  20-116.    ALC  Engine managers  will  coordinate  proposed  repair  requirements  with  SOR  prior  to  negotiations with the customer.  (T-1) 6.2.4.2.  MAJCOM Output Quantity Computation.  The MAJCOM CEM receives the AF flying  hour  program  and  Engine  Actuarial  Removal  Interval  (ARI)  tables  prior  to  the engine repair negotiations.  The following assessments may then be accomplished by the CEM: 6.2.4.2.1.  ARIs  are  reviewed  for  any  changes  from  previous  ARIs  that  cannot  be explained. 6.2.4.2.2.  At the same time, the new flying hours are compared with  the previously projected flying hour documents to reconcile any differences. 6.2.4.2.3.  The ARIs and flying hours are reviewed to identify anomalies. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   53 6.2.4.2.4.  Once the flying hours and ARIs have been determined to be accurate, the Engine  Equipment  Specialist  convert  the  flying  hours  into  engine  flying  hours  by multiplying them by the engine Quantity per Assembly.  These engine hours are then divided by the removal interval from the ARI table.  The resulting numbers are used as the baseline for the MAJCOM’s repair negotiations for the current execution year and for outyear engine repair projections through the next six years.  This baseline is then used during face-to-face negotiations with ALC personnel. 6.2.4.3.  Engine Negotiations.  Every winter, the ALC EIM and the MAJCOM CEM shall conduct engine repair negotiations.  Any differences/disconnects between MAJCOM and ALC computed repair numbers are discussed and a final number that represents the most accurate  requirements  is  negotiated.    During  this  discussion,  the  CEM  and  the  EIM identify  and  explain  any  unique  rationale  they  may  have  included  in  preparing  their requirements.  After this discussion, requirements are agreed upon by them. 6.2.4.4.  Negotiated Engine Repair Requirements.  Agreed requirements are documented on  the  Engine  Overhaul  Negotiation  Summary  maintained  by  the  AFLCMC  EIM  and furnished  to  the  CEMs  and  weapon  system  CAM  personnel.    It  includes  the  negotiated output requirements by the ALC and MAJCOMs.  The input (funded) requirement is then computed  by  applying  the  necessary  work-in-progress  quantities  to  meet  future  year output.    This  input  requirement  is  necessary,  as  funding  is  committed  on  input  of  the engines to the repair process.  This input quantity is multiplied by the engine repair price to determine the DPEM funding requirement. 6.2.5.  DPEM  Requirements  are  developed,  defined,  validated,  prioritized  and  published across  the  logistics  enterprise  within  the  DPEM  sub-program  by  all  stakeholders  in CAFDEx™.   54 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 DPEM SUB-CATEGORY:  AREA/BASE/MANUFACTURE REQUIREMENTS. Chapter 7 7.1.  Overview. 7.1.1.  This chapter defines the Area /Base/ Manufacture (A/B/M) requirements process that facilitates  the  development  of  the  DPEM  A/B/M  AMR  Brochure.    A/B/M  programs  are identified  in four separate RGCs (i.e., M, N, P, and R).  All  organic DPEM Manufacturing requirements  will  be  file  maintained  in  manhours.    These  processes  are  applicable  to  the A/B/M  requirements  at  the  ALCs.    (Ref.  AFMCMAN  20-1,  Maintenance  Planning  and Execution System (MP&E) (D363), Chapter 8). 7.1.2.  Area support is in RGC M.  This provides organic assistance to AF bases in response to the supported Commands’ needs within an ALC’s geographical location.  Area assistance is  provided  in  situations  where  an  organizational  and  intermediate  workload  requirement  is beyond  the  capability  of  or  in  excess  of  the  using  AF  command  or  agency  to  perform  the work.    Although  the  area  support  program  is  constructed  to  serve  the  AF,  its  services  are available  to  non-AF  customers  as  well.    Calibrating  test  measurement  and  diagnostic equipment is an example of an RGC M in an ALC CSAG-M owned (i.e., organic) Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL).  If the calibration is done for a customer/user at a different AF Base in the ALC’s geographical area, it is categorized as area support.  If the calibration is done for a customer/user on base, it is base or tenant support. 7.1.3.  Base  and  tenant  support  is  in  RGC  N.    Organization  and  Intermediate  (O&I)  level requirements may be accomplished as a result of a Host/Tenant Support Agreement (HTSA).  This is a formal written document spelling out the tenant’s needs, which the base/host agrees to  perform.    This  RGC  contains  a  variety  of  workloads,  depending  on  what  each  tenant needs.  Some examples include: draw in and fill of carbon dioxide bottles; cleaning, welding, and  coupling  alignment  on  pre-loaders;  and  test  checks  and  repairs  of  air  pre-coolers.   The agreement  itself  must  state  whether  the  host  or  the  tenant  pays  the  bill.    Sometimes  a customer  need  becomes  a  DPEM  requirement  only  because  it  is  covered  by  a  HTSA.  Without the HTSA, the customer needs may be considered as an O&I level requirement. 7.1.4.  Manufacture of items in support of the Supply CSAG-S is in RGC P.  Manufacture for requirements  other  than  those  supporting  the  CSAG-S  is  in  RGC  R.    Central  procurement appropriations  as  well  as  other  customer  funding  can  pay  for  them.    Manufacture  is authorized under certain conditions such as emergencies (e.g., to prevent work stoppages or support field mission essential requirements), filling the time lag in procurement, or lack of a commercial source. This is organic only. 7.2.  General Information. 7.2.1.  A/B/M requirements (i.e., AFEEIC 546XX/56060) are generally based on three years of  historical  data  and  known  mission  changes.    Precision  Measurement  Equipment Laboratory  (PMEL)  requirements  are  also  based  on  scheduled  calibrations  as  per  the Electronic  Facilities  Equipment  Management  System  report  (for  organic  –  546XX)  and  the PMEL  Automated  Management  System  (for  contracted  –  56060).    For  the  A/B/M requirements that are considered common weapon system support, AFMC is lead command for  requirements  not  tied  to  a  specific  weapon  system.    Generally,  these  requirements  are AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   55 identified and developed by the ALC.  All requirements for A/B/M in the DPEM reports are represented in dollars.  All documented requirements must be valid.  If the requirement lacks historical  execution  data  and  the  desire  is  to  keep  the  requirement,  reduce  the  requirement amount  to  $1K,  otherwise  reduce  the  requirement  to  zero  and  the  requirement  will automatically be archived after one more requirements build cycle.   56 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 DPEM SUB-CATEGORY:  SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS Chapter 8 8.1.  Overview. 8.1.1.  Software maintenance is a DPEM sub-category (Ref. Paragraph 1.3).  This document explains the detail of software requirements identification and provides guidance for National Security  Systems  (NSS)  software  funding  policies  and  procedures  as  they  pertain  to equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapon system.  All requirements submitted for  the  funding  cycle  will  be  fully  documented,  identified,  and  valid.    All  organic  DPEM Software  requirements  will  be  file  maintained  in  man-hours.    All  contract  software requirements will be file maintained in dollars. 8.1.1.1.  The  process  for the  documentation  and  approval  of  organic  software maintenance  after  establishment  of  an  initial  software  production  baseline  utilizes  the three following AFEEICs: 8.1.1.2.  AFEEIC 54001:  Organic Software Maintenance. 8.1.1.3.  AFEEIC  54002:  Depot  Maintenance  Inter-Service  Agreement  (DMISA) Software Maintenance. 8.1.1.4.  AFEEIC 56000:  Contract Software Maintenance. 8.1.2.  Applicable  Software:    Weapon  system  software  maintenance  requirements  include software  embedded  in  aircraft,  vehicles,  missiles,  and  support  equipment.    Software maintenance  requirements  are  changes  designed  to  correct  errors  or  deficiencies,  improve performance  within  existing  specifications,  or  adapt  to  a  changing  environment.    These software  maintenance  requirements  primarily  fall  into  two  categories:    DPEM  and  CSAG Unit Under Test (UUT) funded software.  Note: CSAG software is not in WSS portfolio but managed by AFSC.  The AF utilizes organic software engineers, contractors, interservice, or a combination, depending on the SOR assignment process, to determine the best solution for software  maintenance  performance.    Software  that  the  Program  Offices  have  direct responsibility for includes, as a minimum, the following types: 8.1.2.1.  Operational Flight Programs (OFPs); 8.1.2.2.  Test  Program  Sets  (TPS)s  that  test  a  system  as  installed  on  the  aircraft  at  the organizational level; 8.1.2.3.  Software that supports a weapon system, and is not used for the repair of items (i.e., Mission Planning, Organizational level TPSs); 8.1.2.4.  DPEM  software  that  is  funded  with  EEIC  540  and  includes  NSS  software  and the  associated  software  services  (for  example;  correcting,  perfecting,  and  adapting deficiencies, and software validation/verification) for weapon systems; 8.1.3.  POM  Submission:    The  LRDP  emphasis  is  to  identify  software  requirements  to  be included in the POM submission to ensure funding is available when needed.  The POM is a future  year-oriented  process  concerned  with  estimating  requirements  needed  three  to  seven years  in  advance  of  the  current  calendar  year.    Requirements  must  be  input  to  the  POM AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   57 cycles if funds are to be available to accomplish the software maintenance across the POM timeline. 8.2.  CAM Process. 8.2.1.  The  CAM  Process  will  enable  AFMC  CAM  and  Funds  Holders  to  trace  workload requirements for all EEIC 540 funding necessary to accomplish software maintenance.  As a result,  agreed  upon  software  maintenance  requirements  between  the  Lead  Command  POC, PM,  and  CAM  can  be  identified  and  funded.    This  process  captures  software  maintenance requirements on fielded weapon systems and projections for new systems anticipated during the requirements cycle.  The CAM Process facilitates: 8.2.2.  Communicating customer requirements to the PM; 8.2.3.  Software change requests by the Lead Command POC and PM understanding of those requests; 8.2.4.  Formal  documentation  of  communications  between  the  Lead  Command  POC,  PM, and CAM; 8.2.5.  Identification of resources (funding/man-hours) needed to fulfill software maintenance requests; 8.2.6.  Defined  Requirements  Process  (the  PM  defines  and  validates  the  requirements, commands concur/non-concur on the requirements, and the CAM Office and Funds Holders budget the necessary resources; all WSS requirements must be entered into CAFDEx™ to be reviewed, validated, and published); 8.2.7.  Funding Requests (validated requirements provide the foundation for CAM and Funds Holders to build funding requests through the PPBE; identified requirements must cover the entire period of the upcoming POM cycle. 8.2.8.  For  the  defined  POM  Cycle:    The  PM  and  Lead  Commands  POC  must  project requirements  budget  lead  times  away  to  ensure  funding  is  available  when  required.    If  un-programmed funding is  required within  the current fiscal year, then an out-of-cycle request must  be  submitted  for  the  requirement.    (Refer  to  Paragraph  8.1.3,  POM  Submission,  for additional information.) 8.3.  Participants. 8.3.1.  The  following  paragraphs  outline  the  various  organizations,  agencies,  and  lead positions that are primarily involved in the Software Requirements Review Process (SRRP). 8.3.2.  DM:    The  Lead  Command  POC  and  Supporting  Commands  POCs  review  software maintenance  requirements.    For  the  Direct  Air  Force  (DAF),  the  PMs  make  the  ultimate decision on how funding will be allocated to the various requirements.  These requirements may change as agreements are added, canceled, or modified. 8.3.3.  PM:  The PM is the POC for providing customers with the required mission capability and  is  the  single  focal  point  for  the  system’s  life  cycle.    The  PM  is  responsible  for validation/prioritization  of  the  customer’s  software  requirements  and  is  also  responsible  for the following:   58 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 8.3.3.1.  The  PM  or  person  delegated  will  ensure  that  software  methodology  tab  in CAFDEx™ is completed. 8.3.3.2.  The  PM  will  semi-annually  compare  estimated  and  actual  organic  man-hours and contract costs used to correct deficiencies.  The PM will ensure that this information is  used  to  update  CAFDEx™  requirements,  as  well  as  validate  that  estimating methodologies are accurate. 8.3.3.3.  Annually, the PM will verify that the proper documentation exists.  The PM will verify  that  estimating  methodologies  and  computations  support  the  documented requirements and are available for review upon request. 8.3.4.  ALC  Suppliers:    ALC  DPEM  members  coordinate  requirements  data  with  DM customers  and  work  with  these  customers  to  ensure  proper  program  execution.    They  also work with the program management team to ensure customer funding is properly obligated. 8.3.5.  Process Owner:  The process owner is AFMC/A4P, Weapon Systems Sustainment. 8.3.6.  Process  Coordinator:  HQ  AFMC/A4F  is  the  process  coordinator.    Its responsibilities include updating and distributing process documentation to participants, coordinating issues with  process  participants,  acting  as  facilitator  for  software  meetings,  and  designating  a sample of PCNs to validate data. 8.4.  Additional Technical Guidance’s. 8.4.1.  The  following  paragraphs  provide  technical  guidance  useful  in  understanding  the interactions between the SRRP program requirements and the financial processes. 8.4.1.1.  LRDP Supporting guidance.  The following documents describe the acquisition system within which the LRDP functions: 8.4.1.2.  DoD Directive 5000.01, The Defense Acquisition System. 8.4.1.3.  DoD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System. 8.4.1.4.  AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated Life Cycle Management. 8.4.1.5.  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Command  Designation  and  Responsibilities  for  Weapon Systems. 8.4.2.  Capabilities-Based  Requirements  guidance.    The  following  documents  establish  the guidelines,  policies  and  procedures  for  defining,  developing,  documenting,  validating, approving,  and  managing  AF  capabilities-based  requirements  in  support  of  the  Defense Acquisition Management Framework: 8.4.2.1.  AFPD 10-6, Capabilities Requirements Development. 8.4.2.2.  AFI 10-601, Capabilities-Based Requirements Development. 8.4.3.  Software  Database  Reference:    Software  requirements  (EEIC  540)  under  DPEM  are entered into the CAFDEx™ websystem via the DPEM software tool.  The product generated by the DPEM software tool is referred to as the Software Sustainment Requirement (SSR). 8.5.  Software Maintenance Terms. 8.5.1.  The  following  paragraphs  define  some  of  the  common  terms  used  for  software maintenance. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   59 8.5.1.1.  Software  Change  Requests  (SCRs):    Complexity  of  AF  weapon  systems  and changing  user  requirements  necessitate  software  changes.    Software  changes  are identified  as  deficiencies  to  baselined  systems.    SCRs  are  the  primary  inputs  for  the Requirements  Identification  and  are  how  software  deficiencies  are  submitted.    Software change requests are used interchangeably with the following terms: 8.5.1.2.  Deficiency Reports (DRs). 8.5.1.3.  Software Deficiency Reports (SDRs). 8.5.1.4.  Operational Change Requests (OCRs). 8.5.1.5.  Software System Trouble Reports (SSTRs). 8.5.1.6.  Product Quality Deficiency Reports (PQDRs). 8.5.2.  Software Deficiency Sources:  Software deficiencies come  from a variety  of sources (e.g.,  the  operator,  maintainer,  field  maintainer,  mishaps,  and  developer).    The  weapon system  manager,  along  with  input  from  the  user,  will  consider  the  deficiencies  when determining which software requirements will be required to accomplish the mission via an annual software requirements review.  The weapon system manager applies the information to  prioritize  the  list.    In  many  cases,  these  deficiencies  can  be  corrected  through  software changes.  The various software deficiency sources are defined in the following paragraphs. 8.5.2.1.  Operator:    The  weapon  system  operator  may  identify  deficiencies  based  on system  performance  during  operations.    Although  most  weapons  are  thoroughly  tested prior  to  Initial  Operational  Capability  (IOC)  or  user  acceptance,  not  all  deficiencies  are discovered, noted, or corrected. 8.5.2.2.  Maintainer:    Organizations  providing  weapon  system  software  maintenance support may also detect, identify, and report deficiencies to the baseline software.  These deficiencies  could  include  failure  to  detect  and  isolate  faults,  minor  format  problems  in displays, and critical mission failures of the system. 8.5.2.3.  Field Maintainer:  Field maintenance personnel may identify deficiencies based on  the  need  to  keep  weapons  mission  capable.    Fault  identification  and  troubleshooting are very important aspects in maintaining weapon system mission readiness. 8.5.2.4.  Mishaps:  Another source of deficiencies is mishap investigation reports.  When weapon system mishaps occur, an investigation is normally ordered.  If the mishap is due to  a  system  software  deficiency,  immediate  action  to  make  the  correction  or  develop  a work-around may be ordered. 8.5.2.5.  Developer:  The developer may report software deficiencies for correction to the user  after  the  weapon  system  is  fielded  based  on  knowledge/expertise  of  the  initial operating software baseline.  When deficiencies are identified to the user, it is the user’s responsibility to determine whether these deficiencies are detrimental to the operation of the weapon system and, if so, have them corrected via SCR. 8.5.2.6.  Candidate Requirements List:  A list of software change requests (e.g., upgrades and  deficiencies),  the  user  needs  for  the  weapon  system  to  perform  assigned  missions make  up  the  candidate  requirement  list.    Once  established,  the  list  is  used  to  begin  the Requirements  Definition  step  of  the  LRDP.    A  specific  set  of  software  updates  to  be   60 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 addressed  and  fielded  via  one  executable  file is  commonly  referred  to  as  a  block  cycle.  However; there may be occasion to address mission or time critical patches as defined by the user and executed as a project.  Urgent or emergency software updates are managed as a separate project. 8.5.3.  Software  Maintenance  Organization  Requirements  Coordination:    After  the  user  and the  PM  have  completed  the  Requirements  Definition,  the  list  of  proposed,  validated,  and prioritized  user  requirements  are  forwarded  to  the  software  maintenance  organization  for coordination on cost and schedule requirements.  If further clarification is required, the user, with  the  PM,  provides  the  necessary  information.    After  the  user  and  PM  validate  and prioritized  the  proposed  list,  the  PM  or  the  software  maintenance  organization  begins  the analysis step of the process.  The analysis findings and implementation strategy are presented to  the  user  to  be  evaluated  and  prioritized,  then  sent  to  the  PM  and  to  the  software maintenance  organization  for  validation.    These  validated  change  requests  make  up  the requirements that will be entered into DPEM. 8.5.4.  DPEM/SSRs:    After  review  of  the  software  maintenance  organization  requirements, requirements are entered into DPEM, which generates the SSRs.  This information is used as part of the dataset to prioritize requirements.  The steps taken are as follows: 8.5.4.1.  DPEM captures SSRs funded by EEIC 540 and AFEEIC 56000.  Completion of the input into DPEM should result in the user’s review via collaboration in CAFDEx™.  The  requirements  in  DPEM  are  reviewed,  updated,  and  validated  annually  during  the requirements build.  If not updated during the requirements build, then the OOC process must be utilized. 8.5.4.2.  The  SSR  document  in  CAFDEx™  may  be  used  to  record  the  Software Configuration Control Sub-Board approval to make changes to a configuration baseline. 8.5.4.3.  The SSR document is also used to reflect out-year workload projections that are not  yet  firm.    This  projection  allows  the  user  and  the  PM  sufficient  time  to  plan  and budget for future requirements. 8.5.4.4.  DPEM  was  developed  to  establish  a  standardized  module  which  is  used  to generate SSR documents. 8.5.5.  DPEM Required Inputs:  The following paragraphs provide details for DPEM required information. 8.5.5.1.  DPEM  Report:    Sustainment  requirement  will  be  entered  into  DPEM  which generates  the  SSR  report.    DPEM  will  be  updated  annually  during  the  requirements determination  process.    Once  potential  changes  in  software  are  identified,  they  are presented to the Program Office.  After the data is entered, DPEM generates the forms as required. 8.5.5.2.  PCN:    SSR  report  provides  a  broad  overview  of  the  work  effort  to  be accomplished for a given PCN. 8.5.5.3.  Software  Category:    Note:    Use  these  categories  in  the  Maintenance  Planning and Execution (MP&E) system to classify the software.  A category for each requirement must be identified in DPEM.  The software categories include the following: 8.5.5.3.1.  Operational Flight Program (OFP). AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   61 8.5.5.3.2.  Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). 8.5.5.3.3.  TPS. 8.5.5.3.4.  Electronic Warfare (EW). 8.5.5.3.5.  Mission Planning. 8.5.5.3.6.  Communications-Electronics (C-E). 8.5.5.3.7.  Other. 8.5.5.4.  Task Titles:  The CAFDEx™ DPEM has been developed with a set of task titles and definitions that should cover the various steps in the software maintenance process.  The list was developed to standardize the titles and to ensure that the various steps of the process are taken into consideration during the preparation of the requirements.  There is an option for “Other” for steps that may have been omitted.  When selecting “Other,” the user  must  define  the  task  in  the  task  title  (e.g.,  other:    Navigational  Aids)  with  a  full explanation in the Task Description Block.  (See Attachment 3 for a list of task titles and definitions). 8.5.5.5.  Task Description:  The task description should provide as much information as possible  on  maintenance  efforts  to  be  accomplished  as  well  as  provide  rationale  for performing  the  task  (e.g.,  correction  of  SDRs,  inclusion  of  Engineering  Change Proposals, and interrelationships with other on-going efforts). 8.5.5.6.  PCN  Description:    The  information  in  this  block  will  overlay  into  the CAFDEx™  DPEM  Requirements  Report,  and  will  be  visible  on  the  SSR  Report.    The type  of  information  required  in  this  block  is:    A  description  of  the  work  performed  in each  PCN  or  subsystem.    This  description  may  discuss  the  entire  PCN  or  individual subsystems.  The preparer should choose an approach that explains a requirement clearly to the customer.  Explain what particular type of work is going to be accomplished under this  PCN.    Some  information  which  could  be  included:    the  OFP  system(s)  being maintained,  how  often  software  changes  are  planned  to  be  fielded,  if  this  is  a  special project, etc. 8.5.5.7.  Remarks:  This area can be used for any information the PM feels is relevant to this  effort.    For  example,  if  ATE  Control  and  Support  Software  (CSS)  requirements  do not require changes to TPSs, a statement to that effect should be included here.  Another example would be to list multiple contractors. 8.5.5.8.  Justification:  This section should state why this change and/or block cycle needs to be implemented at this time.  Identify any mission critical, safety, or mandated changes that  are  being  incorporated.    This  information  is  used  to  assist  in  prioritizing  software requirements and is pivotal in supporting advocacy of the requirement.  If PMD directed, provide PMD number. 8.5.5.9.  Methodology:    State  the  method  used  in  converting  software  requirements  into man-hours  in  DPEM.    The  man-hour  requirements  for  organic  and  cost  for  contractor must  be  based  on  a  methodology  documented  in  CAFDEx™  DPEM.    Documentation should be based on artifacts such as cost estimation worksheets, spreadsheets, historical data,  etc.   Information  on  various methods  is  provided  under  the  methodology  tab.    All supporting documentation  should  be  scanned  and  stored  electronically as  an  attachment   62 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 to  the  SRR.    This  documentation  should  be  in-sync  with  the  requirements  documented under DPEM in CAFDEx™. 8.5.5.10.  Impact Statement:  Requirements preparer will collaborate with MAJCOM user to discern mission impact.  This will be stated in terms of impact to the war fighter, e.g., loss  of  capabilities  and/or  the  inability  to  perform  the  mission.    Both  near  term  and  far term impacts should be addressed.  Do not  state impacts in  terms of loss of  manpower, expertise,  or  inability  to  make  needed  software  changes,  impacts  should  be  framed  in operational/capability terms.  If impact statement is not entered correctly, it will be non-concurred on and will require rework. 8.5.5.11.  Constraints,  Explain  Dependency  such  as:    New  acquisitions,  availability of  a weapon system (such as an aircraft for testing), completion of a modification program, or the fielding of a RDT&E effort. 8.5.5.12.  Related  funding:    This  information  may  be  used  to  describe  related  efforts funded by other than the 3400 appropriation, AFEEIC 54001/54002/56000 (e.g., CSAG-S, CLS, RDT&E, and Procurement (i.e., 3010, 3011, 3020, and 3080) funding sources).  When  funding  other  than  AFEEIC  54001/54002/56000  is  being  used,  ensure  the additional funding is available. 8.5.5.13.  PBO  Development:    If  applicable,  assign  an  associated  PBO  to  the  task  to further  justify  the  requirement.    PBO  development  is  accomplished  via  the  WSA/PBO module in CAFDEx™ in accordance with the PBO guidance document provided on the CAM folder, (https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx). inside WSA the PBO EIS Site and 8.5.6.  NSSs  Software  Funding  Policies/Procedures:    The  Clinger-Cohen  Act  of  1996,  (40 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1401 et seq.) has renamed “mission critical computer resources” to NSS. 8.5.7.  Section  5142  Definition:    The  Information  Technology  Management  Reform  Act defines  a  NSS  as  any  telecommunications  or  information  system  operated  by  the  United States Government, the function, operation, or use of which: 8.5.7.1.  Involves intelligence activities. 8.5.7.2.  Involves cryptologic activities related to national security. 8.5.7.3.  Involves command and control of military forces. 8.5.7.4.  Involves equipment that is an integral part of a weapon or weapon systems. 8.5.7.5.  Subject  to  subsection  (b),  is  critical  to  direct  fulfillment  of  military  or intelligence missions. 8.5.8.  Section 5142 Limitation:  Subsection 4.5.5.1. (e) does not include a system that is to be  used  for  routine  administrative  and  business  applications  (including  payroll,  finance, logistics, and personnel management applications). 8.5.9.  Acquisition  vice  Sustainment:    The  proper  use  of  software  sustainment  funding initially depends on the transition between software development and software support, (i.e., when the software is baselined and fielded).  The key transition point between these two life cycle phases is the weapon system user operational acceptance of functional capability.  This AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   63 may happen as a full operational acceptance or it may happen incrementally with an IOC and multiple  follow-on  Designated  Operational  Capability  deliveries.    It  is  imperative  that  all acceptance  activities,  either  final  or  incremental,  be  specifically  documented  to  clearly identify the software system’s development/operational status at all times.   Note:  Software sustainment funds (i.e., AFEEIC 54001/54002/56000) can be used to fund for the following: 8.5.9.1.  Software maintenance engineering. 8.5.9.2.  Analysis, design, code, and test. 8.5.9.3.  Independent Verification and Validation. 8.5.9.4.  Appropriate certifications (such as nuclear certifications). 8.5.9.5.  Ground, Flight, and Live Fire Test. 8.5.9.6.  Engineering data and user documentation (e.g., TOs, source code, TCTOs). 8.5.9.7.  Temporary Duty (of CSAG-M personnel in direct support of a software change). 8.5.9.8.  Software reproduction and distribution. 8.5.9.9.  Changes  made  to  mission  planning  and  trainer/simulator  software  driven  by  a change to OFP software. 8.5.9.10.  Software tools in direct support of a particular software change. 8.5.9.11.  EEIC  540  Definition:    The  definition  of  EEIC  540,  as  stated  in  the  Financial Management  (FM)  Data  Dictionary  is  as  follows;  Accounts  for  the  purchase  from  the CSAG-M,  through  the  DMISA,  or  from  other  government  agencies  of  the  production effort  required  to  design,  code,  test,  and  produce  embedded  weapon  system  and associated  test  system  software  after  establishment  of  an  initial  software  production baseline. 8.5.9.12.  Software  Sustainment  Funding  Activities:    Software  sustainment  funds  (i.e., AFEEIC  54001/54002/56000)  can  only  be  used  to  pay  for  software  maintenance engineering;  analysis,  design,  code,  and  test;  Independent  Verification  and  Validation; appropriate certifications, such as nuclear certifications; flight test; engineering data and user  documentation  (e.g.,  TOs),  source  codes,  TCTOs,  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  of CSAG-M  personnel  in  direct  support  of  a  software  change,  software  reproduction  and distribution, changes made to mission planning and trainer/simulator software driven by a change to OFP software, and software tools in direct support of that particular software change. 8.5.9.13.  Software initial deficiency investigation and lab sustainment. 8.5.10.  AFI 65-601, Vol. 1 Guidance:  Refer to 65-601 for guidance on determining funding rules  associated  with  Information  Processing  Equipment  (IPE),  software,  and  software licenses.    The  basic  intent  of  AFI  65-601,  Vol.1  is  that  the  nature  of  the  change  (i.e., correction of a production baseline deficiency, functional improvements, and post-production deficiency resolution), not the type of organization performing the change (i.e., product, test, logistics  center,  or  contractor)  determines  the  type  of  funds  to  be  used.    The  following paragraphs  provide  guidelines  to  determine  how  to  fund  IPE  and  software  developed  or   64 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 acquired  under  the  system  acquisition  management  instructions  (acquisition  series  of instructions). 8.5.11.  Use  RDT&E  (3600  appropriation)  to:    Fund  all  initial  hardware  and  software development  efforts  up  to  the  point  where  an  operational  configuration  baseline  has  been designed,  developed,  tested,  evaluated,  and  accepted  or  qualified.    This  includes  all  costs related to feasibility studies, system design, preparation, integration (including interface with other  system  or  subsystems),  and  associated  documentation  through  initial  operational  test and evaluation.  Note:  Documented acceptance/qualification for operation use is critical in determining and later defending the use of RDT&E vs. O&M (CAM). 8.5.11.1.  Fund  changes  designed  to  increase  the  weapon  system  capability  beyond  the existing  weapon  system  level  specification  or  changes  implemented  with  unproven  or immature  software  technologies  that  drive  extensive  exploratory  development  or extensive prototyping. 8.5.11.2.  Fund  support  and  maintenance  of  software  used  in  the  research  and development  programs  or  owned  by  RDT&E  funded  activities  (e.g.,  Laboratories  and Test Centers). 8.5.11.3.  Design  and  develop  training  devices,  such  as  simulators,  that  employ  new  or Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) computer hardware and system components but have software  and  interface  components  unique  to  the  training  system.    Use  RDT&E  for  the initial  system  and  all  support  costs  through  AF  acceptance.    Typically,  these  training devices  have  small  quantity  requirements  and  the  initial  system  is  eventually  used  for operational training. 8.5.11.4.  Do  not  use  RDT&E  funds  beyond  the  initial  system  unless  the  training  or testing organizations need more than one full system to  demonstrate the training device performance prior to acceptance. 8.5.11.5.  Utilize  the  same  appropriation  that  funds  the  weapon  or  support  system acquisition  that  it is  a  part  of to  buy  fully  developed  and  tested  hardware  and  software.  Fund  fully  developed  and  tested  hardware  and  software  associated  with  an  equipment modification with the same appropriation that funds the production modification kits (See Paragraph 8.7.4. on modification funding guidance). 8.5.12.  Use  O&M  type  funds  to  finance  the  support  and  maintenance  of  software  after operational acceptance, except for investment items necessary for maintenance and support.  Functions  not  accepted  or  exceptions  noted  will  continue  to  be  funded  by  the  RDT&E Procurement  appropriation.    Use  procurement  appropriations  to  finance  investment  items funded by the procurement appropriations.  Fund changes to existing operational software as follows: 8.5.12.1.  Corrective  maintenance.    Use  O&M  appropriations  or  funds  for  changes designed to correct latent errors or deficiencies in software programs that otherwise meet criteria for operational suitability and usefulness. 8.5.12.2.  Perfective  maintenance.    Use  O&M  appropriations  for  software  changes  that improve  performance  or  other  attributes  within  the  bounds  of  the  existing  system  level weapon system specification. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   65 8.5.12.3.  Adaptive  maintenance.    Use  O&M  appropriations  or  funds  for  changes designed to adapt the weapon system to a changing environment. 8.5.13.  O&M  appropriations  funding  the  maintenance  for  software  changes  (or  blocks  of such changes) may fund increased capabilities that are relatively minor in scope and cost, and that can be accomplished during regular software maintenance (See AFI 65-601, Vol. 1). 8.5.14.  Multiple  appropriations  may  be  used  simultaneously  to  affect  groups  of  software changes.   Different  appropriations  must  fund  separate  and  distinct  tasks  that  are accomplished  as  a  group.    Base  the  funding  determination  for  each  distinct  effort  on applicable  sections  of  AFI  65-601,  Vol.  1  as  discussed  in  this  chapter.    In  no  case  may multiple AF appropriations fund a single task.  There can be multi-funding agreements with FMS and other services. 8.5.15.  Automated Test System (ATS):  ATS includes ATE hardware, CSS, TPS, and UUT.  These terms are defined as follows: 8.5.15.1.  ATE Hardware:  It is the assembly of rack and stack test instruments which are interconnected  and  computer  controlled  by  the  TPS,  used  to  test  the  UUT.    Software changes can be made to the ATE, and can also be used at the organizational level to test systems. 8.5.15.2.  CSS:    This  includes  the  operating  system,  the  Test  Executive,  Self-Test software, Calibration Test software, software drivers, and ATE unique software tools. 8.5.15.3.  TPS:    The  software,  firmware/hardware  such  as  Interface  Test  Adapters,  and instructions used to diagnose performance failures of the UUT, and subsequent to repair completion,  certify  the  UUT  is  fit  for  use.    Software  changes  are  made  to  the  software portion  of  the  TPS  and  are  identified  as  CSAG-S  UUT;  in  2006,  funding  was  changed from  CSAG-S  funded  to  CSAG-M  overhead.    The  maintenance  requirements  to  TPS baseline  software  for  CSAG-S  managed  items  are  funded  by  CSAG-S  through  direct labor hour charges. 8.5.15.4.  UUT:    The  item  requiring  repair  and  certification  as  “fit  for  use.”    Items  can include;  “Avionics  Shop  Replaceable  Unit  (SRU),  Line  Replaceable  Unit  (LRU),  a  jet engine,  a  fuel  control,  aircraft  wiring,  constant  speed  drive,  or  it  may  perform  an  eddy current inspection, to name a few.”  UUT software is the software that operates within the SRU/LRU to control a function of that UUT.  Program Offices or weapon systems fund UUT software changes. 8.6.  OFPs Software Funding. 8.6.1.  OFPs are funded by CAM with DPEM dollars, the requirements are submitted by the Program  Offices  through  the  WSS  process.    OFP  software  is  the  software  that  executes within UUTs when installed on an aircraft that allows several UUTs to operate as a system.  OFP requirements are managed and tracked in the CAFDEx™ system. 8.7.  ATS Software Funding. 8.7.1.  To  determine  the  appropriate  funding  source  for  ATS  software  support  on Government Furnished Property (GFP), treat it  as though the ATE were in the field.  There are two types of ATS; one type of ATS is used to support CSAG-S managed UUTs, these are items  that  CSAG  has  responsibility  for  repair.    CAM  does  not  fund  for  these  items.    The   66 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 other type of ATS is used to test systems on the aircraft/missiles, these items are not CSAG-S managed,  and  are  funded  with  CAM  dollars.    Funding  responsibility  depends  on  which organization has responsibility for the item under test or repair. 8.7.2.  Procurement  Funding:    Funding  for  production  engineering  is  in  the  3010  (i.e., aircraft),  3011  (i.e.,  munitions),  3020  (i.e.,  missiles),  or  3080  (i.e.,  other  procurement) appropriations.  Funding for software engineering in conjunction with a hardware production is funded by the same procurement account that funds the end item production. 8.7.3.  CSAG-M  Funding:    If  ATS  software  support  is  required  for  equipment/software located  only  in  a  CSAG-M  facility,  the  CSAG-M  funds  the  CSS  changes  and  the  TPS changes.  If the ATS software support is part of an ATS upgrade, the CSAG-M also funds the TPS  changes.    If  the  ATE  is  located  in  an  ALC  software  lab  for  which  CSAG-M  is  the predominant  user,  ATS  software  support  will  be  treated  as  if  the  ATE  were  in  a  CSAG-M facility. 8.7.4.  RDT&E Funding:  Funding for software development engineering is normally funded by  the  3600  (i.e.,  RDT&E)  appropriation  in  the  weapon  system  PEC  when  a  change  to  the weapon  system  specification  occurs.    Note:    The  development  of  a  new  test  program  for  a particular  UUT  is  not  inherently  an  RDT&E  function  (other  funding  possibilities  are discussed in the following paragraphs). 8.7.5.  Modification Funding:  If there is a form, fit, function, or interface change to the ATE which  may  involve  software  changes,  and  the  appropriate  authority  approves  it  as  a modification  program,  then  the  modification  program  pays  for  the  ATS  software  support, using the same procurement account that funds the end item modification. 8.7.6.  DPEM O&M Funding:  O&M funds are responsible for ATS software support that is not covered by other types of funding. 8.7.7.  ATS  CSS  Funding:    Fund  under  Program  Group,  ATS,  with  AFMC  as  the  lead command. 8.7.8.  TPS Software Funding:  TPS software is used with ATE usually in the form of a disk, cartridge,  tape,  etc.    The  software  contains  the  test  parameters  to  facilitate  testing  of  items and  subsystems.    Generally,  TPS  changes  should  be  budgeted  and  funded  by  the  activity requiring the change.  The activity funding the TPS change also funds changes to the other TPS  components  out  of  the  same  budget.    If  the  TPS  software  support  is  required  to  test CSAG-S  UUT  items,  the  TPS  change  is  charged  as  an  overhead  to  CSAG-M.    The maintenance requirements to TPS baseline software for CSAG-S managed items are funded by  CSAG-S  through  direct  labor  hour  charges.    See  Paragraph  8.8  for  the  process  on submitting  CSAG-Supply  UUT  requirements.    If  the  TPS  software  is  used  at  the organizational level, then CAM is responsible for that TPS. 8.7.9.  Electronic  Warfare  TPS  Funding:    EW  testers  and  the  associated  software  are considered operations-level (O-level) support equipment, and as such, are not considered as supporting  CSAG-S  UUT  items.    Requirements  for  EW  O-level  tester  software  for  TPSs shall  be  requested  under  the  EW  software  category,  Electronic  Combat  Program  Group.  Requirements  for  Core  O-level  tester  software  are  the  Program  Group:    Automatic  Test Systems.  The purpose of O-level testers is to test the overall system operation as installed on aircraft, not to verify or repair individual system LRUs or SRUs.  Overall system operation AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   67 testing  involves  hardware,  software,  TOs,  and  mission  data.    EW  testers  used  at  the intermediate level to test UUTs are not funded by CAM. 8.8.  CSAG-S TPS Maintenance Funding. 8.8.1.  This section details the policy for CSAG TPS maintenance requirements and funding, and  to  provide  information  on  the  procedures  for  submitting  a  CSAG  TPS  maintenance requirement.    All  TPS  maintenance  requirements  submitted  as  CSAG-S  requirements  are reviewed and approved or disapproved.  After the review is accomplished, approved organic requirements  are  submitted  to  CSAG-M  for  inclusion  as  an  overhead  charge;  the  contract requirements  are  funded  with  CSAG-S  cost  authority.    Note:    The  448  Supply  Chain Management  Wing  (448  SCMW),  and  the  948  Supply  Chain  Management  Group  (SCMG) developed  an  OI  448  SCMW  OI  21-0004,  Maintenance  Test  Program  Set,  that  provides guidance  and  procedures  for  submitting  TPS  maintenance  requirements  and  for  funding policies  as  they  pertain  to  engineering  required  within  TPSs  to  ensure  continued  testing capability of the CSAG-S and budget code 8 UUTs. 8.9.  DMISA.  (e.g., Army, Navy, Marines, etc.), TPS Maintenance Funding: 8.9.1.  Funded  by  CSAG-S  and  AFEEIC  54002  will  be  used.    The  PM  will  process  a  DD 448,  Military  Interdepartmental  Purchase  Request  (MIPR),  to  transfer  funding  to  the supporting agency with the exception of EW systems. 8.10.  Organic Intra-service TPS Maintenance Funding. 8.10.1.  Funded by organic CSAG-M work authority, CSAG-S AFEEIC 54001 will be used. 8.11.  Contract TPS Maintenance Funding. 8.11.1.  Funded by CSAG-S AFEEIC 56000 as a direct fund cite. 8.12.  Government Furnished Supplies and/or Service (GFSS) TPS Funding. 8.12.1.  These  are GFSS requirements where  TPSs are provided to  a contractor as part  of a repair/buy contract.  See FY 09 CSAG-S Execution Guidance on how to fund TPS contract maintenance. 8.13.  Sales Rate Calculations. 8.13.1.  For organic requirements, this paragraph describes which costs should be included in sales rates.  This  paragraph also addresses  certain costs that are not  based on man-hours  or included in sales rates but can be separately billed to weapon systems. 8.13.2.  Routine Expenses:  The CSAG-M sales rates should include routine expenses such as media and packaging.  Functions such as reproduction and distribution are direct charges to the weapon system and should not be included in the sales rate. 8.13.2.1.  Modernization of CSAG-M Equipment: 8.13.2.2.  Software  Upgrades:    When  software  tools  need  to  be  changed  to  support  a specific software requirement, which is usually a block change, add the cost of changing them to the cost of the requirement.  The cost of these changes can be separately billed to the weapon system without being included in the sales rate.  If the upgrade is initiated by CSAG-M solely to increase maintenance capability, this is an indirect cost to the CSAG-M account and should be included in the sales rate.   68 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 8.13.2.3.  Software  Tools:    In  some  cases,  the  cost  of  software  tools  is  included  in  the sales rate; in other cases, the cost should be included in the cost of a block change.  The following paragraph explains when it is part of the sales rate and when it is shown as a task title in CAFDEx™ DPEM as SSRs, which is part of the cost of the block change. 8.13.2.3.1.  The  task  title  “software  tools”  should  be  used  when  software  tools  must be purchased in order to produce an end item of software that is to be delivered to the weapon  system.    Software  tools  that  belong  in  this  category  are:  compilers, assemblers, interpreters, emulators, translators and simulation software that run to test an  item  of  software  or  to  provide  a  system  test  capability.    They  are  a  part  of  the support  requirements.   These  software  tools  touch  the  end  product.   In  other  words, the  software  cannot  be  produced  or  tested  without  these  tools.    Some  of  these  tools can  be  COTS  that  have  been  integrated  into  the  software  production  and  test environment. 8.13.2.3.2.  Software  tools  (e.g.,  Microsoft  Project)  that  are  used  to  manage  and control the planning and execution of a software production item should be included in  the  sales  rate  as  overhead.    These  tools  cover  items  such  as  estimators, management control tools, metric generation tools, and chart production.  Often these tools  are  stand-alone  tools  that  support  more  than  a single  product  and  are  typically low cost items. 8.13.2.4.  Exceptions:  An exception to this rule should be those special support items not in  current  use  such  as  a  version  of  an  operating  system  (e.g.,  Windows  95)  that  is  no longer typically used by the organization but must be maintained in the old configuration.  The cost to maintain Windows 95 should be shown under task title “software tools”.  If it is  the  developer’s  choice  to  use  or  not  use  a  product,  then  it  should  be  a  cost  that  is included in the rate. 8.13.2.5.  Rationale:  Standard off-the shelf standalone items should be funded within the sales rate because the items are essentially supported by the vendor and no cost other than the purchase price is normally involved.  When a process requires out-of-date software no longer  supported  by  the  vendor,  then  costs  are  often  incurred  that  go  far  beyond  the purchase  price  to  maintain  a  capability.    In  the  case  of  old  software,  it  takes  special support to keep the capability and this cost is considered necessary to produce the product and is  funded outside the rate.  If an item is  integrated into the process and the process cannot be executed without the product, then the cost should be shown as ‘software tools’ in the task title. 8.13.2.6.  Hardware  Upgrades:    Add  the  cost  of  changing  hardware  to  the  requirement cost  when  hardware  components,  including  components  in  GFP,  need  to  be  changed  in order to  support a specific software requirement,  which is usually a block change.  The cost of changes can be separately billed to the weapon system without being included in the  sales  rate.    If  the  upgrade  is  initiated  by  CSAG-M  solely  to  increase  maintenance capability, this is an indirect cost to the CSAG-M account and should be included in the sales rate.  Modernization that involves acquiring end items, including capital equipment, should not be directly funded with DPEM funds.  If the modernization effort exceeds the capitalization  threshold,  which  is  currently  $100,000,  the  Organic  CSAG-M  Capital Purchases Program funds the effort. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   69 8.13.3.  Software Control Center (SCC) Support:  SCC have been established at each ALC to perform stock and store which consists of the following: 8.13.3.1.  Filing of the software media. 8.13.3.2.  Inventorying the media. 8.13.3.3.  Removing the media when the software is decommissioned. 8.13.3.4.  Archiving software when it has been replaced by a new revision. 8.13.3.5.  Pulling the media for duplication. 8.13.3.6.  Refilling once duplication has been completed. 8.13.3.7.  Pulling software for research. 8.13.3.8.  Acts  as  the  single  point  of  contact  for  stock  and  storage  of  all  Computer Program Identification Number software. 8.13.3.9.  Verify  and  establish  all  necessary  labeling,  and  validate  date  in  system database. 8.13.3.10.  Maintains common software master repository for all fielded software. 8.13.3.11.  Incorporate  configuration  changes, accounting. including identification  and  status 8.13.3.12.  Include  requirements  on  the  same  DPEM  SSRs  document  that  describes  the configuration change (i.e., block change) when possible. 8.13.3.13.  Accept and validate the software media as required by the customer. 8.13.3.14.  Reproduction and distribution activities of fielded and non-fielded software. 8.13.3.15.  Provide copies of existing software, when requested by authorized users. 8.13.3.16.  Validate potential users to have software access. 8.13.3.17.  Activities shall include labor and materials. 8.13.3.18.  Performs, as a minimum, yearly audits on master software repository. 8.13.3.19.  Maintains copies of CSCIs in an off-site location. 8.13.4.  For  fielded  software,  a  common  PCN  has  been  established  for  each  ALC  SCC  to fund all requested validated goods and services.  The PM are not required to fund the SCCs for  services  related  to  fielded  software,  but  may  choose  to  utilize  weapon  system  PCNs  to meet specific weapon system objectives. 8.13.5.  For un-fielded software, the PMs responsible for the software development effort are also required to fund the SCCs for the services required to reproduce and distribute software to authorized users. 8.14.  Software Cost Estimation. 8.14.1.  A  sound  basis  of  estimates  is  necessary  to  lend  significant  credibility  to  the definition,  validation,  and  justification  of  the  resources  necessary  to  provide  the  user   70 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 requested software maintenance support.  Software cost estimation is a standard component of the SRRP analysis. 8.14.2.  Deficiency  Requirements:    Deficiency  requirements  must  be  converted  into  man-hours  and  document  the  methodology  under  CAFDEx™/DPEM.    Historical  data  should  be based  on  deficiencies  whether  they  are  called  PQDR,  DR,  OCR,  STR,  or  SDR.    The  AF understands the need to maintain a trained and qualified workforce to perform the work, but to  capture  the  requirements  for  funding,  the  following  is  needed:    the  deficiency requirements;  what  was  used  as  the  basis  for  identifying  the  requirements;  and  how  the deficiency requirements were converted into man-hours. 8.14.3.  Software  Methodology:    Software  Methodology  and  the  concise  computations  that are  used  to  support  the  documented  requirement  must  be  prepared  and  documented  in CAFDEx™. 8.14.4.  Estimation  Techniques:    Approved  estimation  techniques  are  available  in  a  drop down  box  on  the  Methodology  tab  in  CAFDEx™/DPEM.    Note:    After  selecting  the preferred  cost  estimation  technique,  comments  and  constraints  field  will  become  available.  “Comments are mandatory and as referenced above, should contain concise calculation used to  derive  the  requirement  or  a  reference  to  an  attached  supporting  document.”    Constraints field should contain constraints specific the task being addressed. 8.14.4.1.  Historical  Data:    This  technique  utilizes  past  history  and  data  as  the  basis  for projecting future requirements. 8.14.4.2.  Algorithmic  Model:   The  algorithmic  model  provides  one  or  more mathematical algorithms to produce a software cost-estimate as a function of a number of major  cost  drivers.    The  cost  drivers  are  factors,  which  influence  the  software  project cost.  Some of the most well-known algorithmic models are: 8.14.4.2.1.  Boehm’s Constructive Cost Model. 8.14.4.2.2.  Putnam’s Software Lifecycle Model. 8.14.4.2.3.  System  Evaluation  and  Estimation  of  Resources  -  Software  Estimating Model (SEER-SEM). 8.14.4.2.4.  Price Trueplanning Model. 8.14.4.3.  Expert Judgment:  Involves consulting with one or more experts and using their experience  and  knowledge  of  the  proposed  project  to  arrive  at  an  estimate  of  its  cost.  This is often used as a complementary method to algorithmic model. 8.14.4.4.  Analogy:   This  method  involves  estimating  the new  project’s  cost  by  analogy with one or more completed projects in the same application domain. 8.14.4.5.  Bottom-Up:  With bottom-up estimating, each component of the software job is separately estimated and the result is summed to produce an estimated cost for the overall product. 8.14.5.  Required  Documentation:    The  documentation  required  depends  on  the  estimation methodology  utilized;  refer  to  the  following  paragraphs  for  further  guidance.    Note:   The PCN Summary with block changes and the Historical Data sheet with block changes should be used for all software program changes that extend past a one year timeframe. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   71 8.14.5.1.  The  preferred  method  for  cost  estimation  is  to  utilize    historical  data.    The documentation  should  include  the  number  of  software  deficiencies  considered  and corrected  in  each  of  the  past  fiscal  years  used  for  the  estimation,  and  the  number  of manhours that were utilized to correct the deficiencies. 8.14.5.2.  If  an  algorithmic  model  is  utilized  for  cost  estimation,  the  documentation should  include  the  model  input  data,  the  model  output  data,  and  should  include comparison information to other models or methodologies that were considered. 8.14.5.3.  If  expert  judgment  is  utilized  for  cost  estimation,  the  documentation  should include the results of the experts and their rationale.  The rationale should include enough detail  to  ensure  that  a  thorough  and  complete  analysis  was  performed.    A  justification stating  that  the  estimate  was  based  upon  xx  years  of  experience  is  NOT  adequate substantiation for performing cost estimation. 8.14.5.4.  If  estimation  by  analogy  is  utilized,  the  documentation  should  include  the rationale that supports the  selection of the analogous systems.  Also, the documentation should include the number of deficiencies of the systems that were considered. 8.14.5.5.  If bottom-up estimating is utilized, the documentation should include all of the required data that supports the cost estimate. 8.14.6.

AMARG (USAF is the DoD executive agent for aircraft storage and reclamation per DoD  4160.21-M,  Defense  Material  Disposition  Manual),  and  other  locations,  encompass storage of AF-owned assets that are no longer part of the AF active inventory.  These items include  aircraft,  missiles,  engines,  production  tooling  and  OMEI  at  AMARG  or  at  other organic  sites  when  deemed  in  the  best  interest  of  the  AF.    Tasks  include  input  to  storage, mobilization  upgrade,  withdrawal/regeneration,  inspections/repair,  and  preparation  for disposal.  The PM for Storage Sustainment resides at AMARG and is responsible for funding post-induction storage maintenance and disposal preparation for aircraft, engines, tooling and OMEI at AMARG.  Aircraft SPO Migration Plans, developed IAW AFI 16-402, Aerospace Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination, and AFTO 1-1-686,  Desert  Storage,  Preservation  and  Process  MLN  for  Acft,  Acft  Engs,  and  Acft  Aux Power Unit Engs forecast requirements for the Storage Sustainment budget for aircraft stored at AMARG.  Requirements for other stored assets are based on historical data.  All organic DPEM  storage  requirements  will  be  file  maintained  in  terms  of  man-hours.    The aforementioned  processes  apply  to  storage  and  disposal  preparation  of  inactive  AF-owned assets. 9.2.  General Information. 9.2.1.  Tasks  performed  by  AMARG  include  induction  of  aircraft  into  storage,  storage maintenance,  withdrawal/regeneration,  and  HAZMAT  handling  and  mobilization  upgrade.  In  addition  to  aircraft,  AMARG  accepts  immediate  supporting  items  such  as  storage containers,  engines,  exchangeable  items,  support  equipment,  special  tooling/special  test equipment  and  anything  else  required  for  storage  and  mobilization  upgrade  support.    Other items  stored  at  AMARG  are  the  responsibility  of  the  owning  organization.    The  Storage Sustainment  PM  develops  post-induction  storage  requirements  for  most  AF  owned  assets (e.g.,  aircraft,  missiles,  and  all  immediate  supporting  items  such  as  engines,  tooling  and OMEI) currently stored at AMARG that are not part of a MAJCOM active inventory.  AFI 16-402,  Aerospace  Vehicle  Programming,  Assignment,  Distribution,  Accounting,  and Termination, requires weapon system Program Offices to develop and update their migration plan  on  a  regular  basis.    Migration  Plans  communicate  the  AF’s  plans  and  requirements  as related to the disposition of AF aircraft in order to better manage the operational fleets and coordinate  on  aircraft  divestitures.    All  documented  requirements  must  be  valid.    If  the requirement lacks historical execution data and the desire is to keep the requirement, reduce the  requirement  amount  to  $1K,  otherwise  reduce  the  requirement  to  zero  and  the requirement will automatically be archived after one more requirements build cycle. 9.2.1.1.  Storage.  There are five types of storage accomplished at AMARG IAW AFTO 1-1-686,  Desert  Storage,  Preservation  and  Process  MNL  for  Acft,  Acft  Engs,  and  Acft Aux Power Unit Engs. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   73 9.2.1.2.  Type 1000 is long-term storage.  The functional and material integrity of aircraft systems  and  components  is  maintained  for  extended  periods  of  time.    It  is  considered valid up to 48 months from the preservation completion date. 9.2.1.3.  Type 1500 is long-term storage without a preservation cycle. 9.2.1.4.  Type  2000  is  storage  for  reclamation.    The  functional  and  material  integrity  of aircraft systems and components is maintained pending their removal and return to active service.  Aircraft  in  Type  1000  storage  may  be  downgraded  to  Type  2000  when  the aircraft is designated as awaiting reclamation. 9.2.1.5.  Type  3000  is  flyable/hold  storage.    The  aircraft  is  maintained  in  active  flying status  while  awaiting  either  flight  schedules  or  induction  to  Type  1000  or  Type  2000 storage.    The  aircraft  remains  assigned  to  the  organization  and  does  not  require  a  913 (Removal/Disposal of item) action.  This type of storage has duration of 45 days and may be  extended  one  time  for  an  additional  45-day;  FMS  aircraft  pending  sale  fall  into  this category. 9.2.1.6.  Type  4000  is  disposal  storage.    It  applies  to  aircraft,  which  are  being  turned directly  over  for  disposal.    The  procedures  of  this  type  storage  only  make  the  aircraft maintenance safe while awaiting disposal. 9.2.2.  Represervation every four years pertains to aircraft in Type 1000 storage.  It reverses the  induction  process.    The  protective  coating  is  removed.    The  aircraft  is  inspected  and treated for corrosion, greased/lubed, and washed.  The aircraft is refueled and engine is run with  all systems operating.  The aircraft is then put  through the induction procedures again and towed back to the storage area for another four years. 9.2.3.  Inductions and withdrawals.  Inductions and withdrawals are coordinated with the PM to  identify  aircraft,  missile  and  associated  asset  storage  requirements.    Withdrawal  of  the aircraft  from  storage  can  be  by  air  or  over  land.    Inductions  and  withdrawals  are  budgeted and  paid  for  by  the  losing/gaining  activities  respectively.    Once  an  aircraft  is  identified  as excess,  the  development  of  programmed  reclamation  requirements  (i.e.,  save  list)  through reclamation  managers  and  item  managers is  required.    Reclamation  is  paid  for  by CSAG-S work authority in coordination with the item managers. 9.2.4.  Once an asset is inducted into AMARG, ownership typically transfers to AFMC.  The Storage  Sustainment  PM  is  then  responsible  for  storage  sustainment  cost  IAW  AFTO  1-1-686,  AF  directive  or  customer  SOW  for  aircraft,  missiles,  engines,  production  tooling  and other  major  end  items  (OMEI)  at  AMARG.    However,  funding  for  any  upward  change  in storage  category  other  than  what  is  directed  by  AFTO  1-1-686  or  AF  directed  should  be sourced by the requestor of the change. 9.2.5.  Miscellaneous  requirements  include  support  of  equipment  or  assets  not  assigned  to temporarily  stored  aircraft  at  AMARG  by  the  PM.    The  Maintenance  Inspections  generally can be funded by DPEM funds that are budgeted and paid for by the PM.   74 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 10 DPEM SUB-CATEGORY:  EXCHANGEABLES, AND OTHER MAJOR END ITEMS (OMEI) REQUIREMENTS 10.1.  Overview. 10.1.1.  This chapter defines the DPEM Exchangeables and OMEI requirements process. 10.1.1.1.  Exchangeables.    Air  Force  Depot-Level  Reparables  (DLRs)  are  primarily funded through the Air Force Working Capital Fund (WCF), not WSS.  There are some components however that due to their unique nature do not fit into the business constructs of the AF WCF.  These items are DPEM Exchangeables and the repairs for these items are  funded  under  WSS.    (Reference  AFMCMAN  20-1,  Maintenance  Planning  and Execution System (MP&E) for more information.) 10.1.1.2.  All  requirements  for  DPEM-funded  Exchangeables  will  be  represented  in dollars by multiplying the quantities at the NSN level by the current repair cost. 10.1.1.3.  Examples of DPEM funded Exchangeables are as follows: 10.1.1.3.1.  Missiles  -  Consists  of  the  repair  of  tactical  and  strategic  stock  fund exempt missile items. 10.1.1.3.2.  War Consumables  - Includes the repair of the fuel tanks, racks, adapters and pylons. 10.1.1.3.3.  Cartridge  Actuated  Device/Propellant  Actuated  Device  (CAD/PAD)  - Includes repair, replacement, and testing of CAD/PAD items usually required due to scheduled  change  out  programs.    Depot  level  rework  consists  of  inspections, component disassembly, paint stripping, and propellant and lot acceptance testing. 10.1.1.3.4.  Other Requirements - To include Navy and FMS negotiated Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR) workloads as well as un-programmed tasks from various customers.  Assets repaired under the repair and return philosophy, where the same  repaired  asset  is  returned  to  the  customer  from  which  it  was  sent.    These requirements  will  be  developed  under  separate  PCNs  for  each  funds  holder  (e.g.,  if NGB  owns  the  asset  the  Customer  Code  will  be  B).    For  those  assets  not  repaired under the repair and return concept, the requirements will be developed under a PCN with a Customer Code of A. 10.1.2.  OMEI.  (i.e.,  AFEEIC  544XX/56040)  include  all  programmed  (i.e.,  RGC  G)  and unprogrammed (i.e., RGC H) repair of hardware that does not fall under Aircraft, Missiles, Engines,  or  Exchangeables.    OMEI  requirements  are  identified  within  D200C  with  either ERRC  Code  S  or  U.    These  requirements  are  programmed  at  regular  intervals  or  estimated using historical data and known mission changes.  These items are repaired on an as needed basis.    Other  OMEI  requirements  include  but  are  not  limited  to  space  systems  shelters, mobile  command  and  control  vehicles,  missile  transportation  and  handling  equipment, ground power generators, railway equipment, physiological trainers, support equipment and vehicles,  cryogenic  systems,  automated  test  equipment,  hush  houses,  and  noise  suppressors (i.e., ERRC S and U).  All documented requirements must be valid.  If the requirement lacks AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   75 historical  execution  data  and  the  desire  is  to  keep  the  requirement,  reduce  the  requirement amount  to  $1K,  otherwise  reduce  the  requirement  to  zero  and  the  requirement  will automatically be archived after one more requirements build cycle. 10.1.2.1.  Equipment.    All  items  in  this  category  come  from  the  Equipment  Item Requirements  Computation  System  (i.e.,  D200C)  and  consist  of  maintaining,  repairing, and  calibrating  many  kinds  of  equipment.    Some  of  the  major  categories  are:  Air-to-Ground  (AGM)-65  support  equipment  and  test  sets,  support  equipment  for  the  DA3H Strafe Scoring System and Aerial Gunnery Target System, and laser ATE.  Also included is  ground-based  support  equipment  for  photonics  consisting  of:  light  tables  for  film processing, copy cameras, enlargers and stereo scopes.  Other items are:  miscellaneous equipment  applicable  to  robotics  used  to  evaluate  munitions  in  the  field,  and  support equipment for rocket motors on various weapon systems such as air intercept missile Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-9, AGM-86/86B, AGM-88, and AIM-120. 10.1.2.2.  Conventional  Munitions.    These  requirements  include  but  are  not  limited  to repair,  refurbishment,  marking,  test,  and  inspection  of  items  such  as  general  purpose bombs,  fuses,  laser  guided  bombs,  joint  direct  attack  munitions,  AC-130  gunship  105 millimeter rounds, and explosive ordnance devices. 10.1.2.3.  Communications-Electronics.    OMEI  requirements  may  include  PDM,  Depot Field Team support, and unprogrammed repair and overhaul for C-E items which consists of fielded Atmospheric Early Warning System, Ground Theatre Air Control Systems, Air Traffic  Control  Landing  Systems,  Range  Threat  Systems,  Radio  and  Television Communication  Systems,  and  Military  Satellite  Communication  Terminals.    The Communications-Electronics Schedule Review (CESR) process is the means by which C-E maintenance requirements for fielded weapon system are identified to the depot support functions  by  the  weapon  system  PM.    The  CESR's  goal  is  to  formally  document  C-E requirements and negotiate a viable depot or contractor overhaul/repair schedule to meet user's needs. 10.2.  General Information. 10.2.1.  Depot requirements for maintenance and other depot level services are developed by the  commodity  group  and  are  identified  through  the  requirements  determination  processes.  These  processes  include  the  use  of  the  D200A  System,  the  CESR  Process,  Consolidated Analysis  Reporting  System  (CARS),  and  PM  evaluations.    The  DPEM  process,  to  include Exchangeables and OMEI consists of policies products and procedures process members use to  communicate  DPEM  requirements  and  funding  between  customers  and  suppliers.  Participants  in  the  process  are  the  PM,  Lead  and  Supported  Commands,  Funds  Holders  (to include the CAM office) and Product/Sustainment Centers. 10.2.1.1.  Exchangeables. 10.2.1.2.  Requirements  Determination.    Exchangeable  requirements  for  DLRs  are generally computed by the Secondary Item Requirements System (i.e., D200A) and paid for by CSAG-S.  Stock fund exempt items may be computed by either the Conventional Ammunition  System  or  the  D200A  system.    Manual  computations  based  on  historical data are also used.  All documented requirements must be valid.  If the requirement lacks historical execution data and the desire is to keep the requirement, reduce the requirement   76 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 amount  to  $1K,  otherwise  reduce  the  requirement  to  zero  and  the  requirement  will automatically be archived after one more requirements build cycle. 10.2.1.3.  Preparation of Programmed Exchangeables Requirements.  Stock fund exempt requirements  may  be  computed  by  either  the  Conventional  Ammunition  System  or  the Secondary  Item  Requirements  System.    The  D200A  computes  requirements  for  buy, repair, and termination of recoverable items.  Generally, the repair requirement is based on  an  average  of  the  past  two  years  rate  times  the  flying  hour  program.    After  the requirements are computed, D200A passes repair requirements to the D075; Automated Budget  system  (ABCS;  MISTR  System  (i.e.,  G019C)  via  D075;  ABCS;  reference AFMCI 23-112, Management of Items Subject to Repair (MISTR). 10.2.1.4.  Preparation  of  Unprogrammed  Exchangeables  Requirements.    Unprogrammed Exchangeables  are  RGC  code  L  (i.e.,  other  than  MISTR  and  program  directives).    The procedure used to compute unprogrammed Exchangeables involves each weapon system PM  estimating  how  much  repair  activity  will  be  generated  by  assigned  systems  in  the next year and out years.  These projections are based on the past year obligations, as well as other known program changes, e.g., PMD directions, START, etc. 10.2.1.5.  System  Inputs.   The  programmed  and  unprogrammed  scrubbed  NSN requirements  are  rolled  up  at  the  applicable  PCN  and  file  maintained  by  the  Program Office into the DPEM module located within CAFDEx™. 10.2.1.6.  Collaboration/Validation/Publication.  After the Exchangeable requirements are file  maintained  the  collaboration  phase  occurs.    The  collaboration  phase  involves  the Program Office, Vehicle Equipment Management Support Office (VEMSO), Supporting Commands,  and  Funds  Holders  viewing  the  requirements  and  providing  remarks  to improve the justification of the requirements.  The final step in the collaboration phase is for the lead MAJCOM to concur with the requirement.  After the collaboration phase the requirement can be validated and published in CAFDEx™ by the PM. 10.2.2.  CESR Process and Participants.  AF MAJCOM C-E Depot PMs, including NGB and AFRC  are  responsible  to  obtain  from  their  units,  C-E  DM  requests  by  weapon  system. Requirements  are  identified  and  validated  by  the  MAJCOM  maintaining  command,  IAW AFTO  00-25-108.    The  CESR  Program  Office  is  the  AFMC  focal  point  for  all  C-E requirement  schedules,  process  subgroups,  and  CESR  meetings.    Requirements  are coordinated  by  lead  commands  to  ensure  total  force  capabilities.    The  Program  Office  and logistics personnel determine the SOR, negotiate schedules, and provide budget information for their C-E programs.  The CESR process is governed by AFTO 00-25-108.  Unit guidance for  establishing  DM  requirements  is  provided  in  AFTO  00-25-108,  Section  II.    Validated requirements become part of the validated FY Final Requirements Report to ensure funding requirements  are  identified  to  the  responsible  funds  holding  authority.    The  CESR  meeting date is determined based on the AFMC CAM Requirements Schedule.  The meeting will be held  NLT  30  days  prior  to  the  beginning  of  the  AFMC  CAM  Requirements  Determination start date. 10.2.3.  CARS  Requirements.    Vehicle  depot  requirements  are  scheduled  in  CARS  IAW guidance  in  AFTO  36-1-191,  Technical  and  Managerial  Reference  for  Motor  Vehicle Maintenance.    All  documented  requirements  must  be  valid.    If  the  requirement  lacks historical  execution  data  and  the  desire  is  to  keep  the  requirement,  reduce  the  requirement AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   77 amount  to  $1K,  otherwise  reduce  the  requirement  to  zero  and  the  requirement  will automatically  be  archived  after  one  more  requirements  build  cycle.    In  the  development  of CARS  Overhaul  Allocation  report  the  PMSs  will  send  to  AFELM/VEMSO,  a  printout  of each  vehicle  management  activity  with  Depot  eligible  vehicles  Projections.    VEMSO  will consolidate and validate DM overhaul requirements and input these requirements via CARS.  This  data  will  be  used  to  prepare  an  induction  schedule.    The  VEMSO  shall  provide information  such  as  the  age  of  vehicle  and  vehicle  registration  number  on  vehicles  to  be repaired.  This data can be used as the initial baseline and used to negotiate repair contracts.  The  computed  vehicle  maintenance  requirements  in  CARS  are  rolled  up  at  the  applicable PCN  and  maintained  in  the  DPEM  module  by  the  Program  Office  and  accessed  via CAFDEx. 10.2.4.  Non-System Generated Requirements.  Examples of these requirements may include, but  not  limited  to,  cyclical  mobile  DM  for  radomes,  shelters,  physiological  chambers, generators,  etc.    These  requirements  are  separated  into  two  categories:    Tactical  Shelters, Radomes and Towers, and all other OMEI non-system generated requirements. 10.2.4.1.  Tactical  Shelters,  Radomes  and  Towers.    Requirements  are  based  upon historical data; indicated frequency of maintenance is based on environmental conditions, location, customer input etc.  The schedules are electronically maintained in the Shelters Radomes  Maintenance  Application  (SRMA)  module  within  CAFDEx™  for  the upcoming  fiscal  year.    This  schedule  is  reviewed  annually  by  the  Program  Office  in coordination  with  the  customer.    Changes  are  made  and  a  final  schedule  is  published prior to the beginning of the AFMC CAM Requirements Determination start.  Budgeting projections are based on a three year history for the average number of sites visited and the  average  cost  per  site  for  each  funds  holder.    All  documented  requirements  must  be valid.    If  the  requirement  lacks  historical  execution  data  and  the  desire  is  to  keep  the requirement, reduce the requirement amount to $1K, otherwise reduce the requirement to zero  and  the  requirement  will  automatically  be  archived  after  one  more  requirements build cycle. 10.2.4.2.  Other  OMEI  non-system  generated  requirements.    OMEI  requirements  not applicable to any of the above processes are generated based upon history and knowledge of programmatic needs and/or changes.  These requirements will be identified by the PM and Lead Command and file maintained appropriately.   78 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 11 WSS PROCESS AREA:  CONTRACT LOGISTICS SUPPORT (CLS) REQUIREMENTS 11.1.  Overview. 11.1.1.  This chapter outlines processes for identifying, reviewing, and programming CLS for operational  weapon/non-weapon  systems,  subsystems,  and  non-AFWCF  products  and materiel.  CLS requirements are prepared using the LRDP and reflect total sustainment for a weapon/non-weapon  system  or  program  group.    The  CAM  office  and  Funds  Holders  use these  requirements  to  develop  POM  submissions,  defend  the  submissions,  support  the President’s Budget (PB), and assist in developing execution plans. 11.1.1.1.  CLS  is  a  method  of  contracting  WSS  support  for  a  program,  system, subsystem, training system, equipment, or item used to provide all or part of the product support  elements  in  direct  support  of  the  approved  sustainment  strategy  (Ref:  AFI  63-101/20-101,  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management).    Generally  WSS  CLS  requirements mirror  the  types  of  sustainment  requirements  found  on  organically  supported  programs.  However,  on  systems  utilizing  a  Performance  Based  Logistics  (PBL)  strategy  the sustainment  elements  supported  via  CLS  may  include  sustainment  elements  not traditionally considered WSS, such as organic Flying Hour requirements.  It may include partnership  work  accomplished  by  the  Government  but  for  which  the  System  Program Offices are responsible for performance outputs.  All documented requirements must be valid.    If  the  requirement  lacks  historical  execution  data  and  the  desire  is  to  keep  the requirement, reduce the requirement amount to $1K, otherwise reduce the requirement to zero  and  the  requirement  will  automatically  be  archived  after  one  more  requirements build cycle. 11.1.2.  CLS  applications  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  the  support  of  government-owned COTS, aircraft, missiles, and equipment; Research and Development prototypes converted to operational use; and other instances where AFMC organic life-cycle logistics support is not planned, available or used. 11.1.3.  Requirements  Standardization.    The  purpose  of  this  effort  is  to  allocate  CLS requirements  at  the  task  level  in  a  standardized  and  accepted  structure  for  requirements analysis by organizations, such as AF/A4, the AF Cost Analysis Agency (AFCAA), Deputy Assistant Secretary of the AF for Cost and Economics, and SAF/FMC.  AF/A4 will use the allocation information as source data to answer CLS program taskers from Congress, DoD, and AF. 11.1.4.  Contract Flexibility and Cost Visibility.  The Department of the AF must continue to improve Enterprise-wide Integrated Life Cycle Management for AF systems and subsystems.  In an effort to facilitate this improvement the Integrated Life Cycle Management Executive Forum  approved  the  Next  Generation  CLS  initiative.    Through  this  initiative,  the  U.S.  Air Force Contract Sustainment Support Guide (CSSG) was developed.  This guide is accessible from  the  Key  References  list  on  the  following  Product  Support  Management  site:  (https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=678776&lang=en-US). 11.1.4.1.  The  CSSG  captures  best  practices  that  industry  and  government  have demonstrated and applied in support of AF systems and subsystems.  Program teams can AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   79 use the CSSG to control and reduce cost by developing/incorporating cost visibility and contract flexibility strategies. 11.1.4.2.  CLS  contracts  should  reflect  the  PM  requirement  to  balance  affordability, flexibility,  and  required  operational  capability.    To  support  the  risk-based  decisions across  the  Enterprise,  flexibility  should  be  incorporated  into  contracts  for  incremental funding to allow for increase and decrease of funding levels.  Cost visibility should also be  incorporated,  it  is  essential  in  successful  cost  management,  cost  reduction,  and informed  program  decision  making.    Various  measures  can  validate  the  successful reduction of costs and provide the level of visibility needed to make informed decisions.  Improved cost visibility helps discover hidden costs, whether it be a contractor’s hidden cost, life cycle cost, or cost endured by the AF as a result of its current processes.  Cost visibility  also  provides  insight  into  performance-based  agreements  to  understand  the range of possible costs associated to the various service levels. 11.1.4.3.  To optimize output or program capability and meet readiness and performance goals, each program should assess the current level of flexibility and cost visibility as a method to leverage available resources to required performance. 11.2.  CLS General Information. 11.2.1.  CLS Requirements Process:  The LRDP provides the process flow and timelines for the CLS requirements build.  The process output is the approved CLS Requirement; it is the link between CLS requirements and the budget and execution process. 11.2.1.1.  Identifying  CLS  Requirements.    AFI  63-101/20-101  provides  policy  for identifying CLS requirements.  For CLS EEIC 578, the PM shall document the defined support requirements annually using the Weapon System Management Support (WSMS) Websystem  inside CAFDEx™.  WSMS allows users to  document and support  all CLS, Sustaining Engineering, and TO requirements in a standardized format, (See Attachment 1  for  details).    These  requirements  are  also  documented  with  associated  funding  needs.  The CLS requirements shall include the actual and forecasted CLS requirements over an eight-year  period  (i.e.,  prior  year,  current  year,  two  budget  years,  plus  four  projected years).  As a minimum the CLS requirements shall match all sustainment requirements to the  costs  associated  with  maintenance  labor,  engineering,  technical  data  (e.g.,  TO maintenance  and  documentation),  support  equipment,  calibration,  facilities,  training, spares replenishment or repair, parts obsolescence or Diminishing Manufacturing Sources (DMS)  and projected Depot Maintenance (DM) (split into  contractor and public-private partnership  workload)  content to  support  the  “50/50”  DM  workload  reporting requirements.  CLS requirements are composed of individual tasks/sub-tasks.  IAW AFI 65-601Vol. 1, Budget  Guidance  and  Procedures, use  the appropriate SAF/FM  AFEEIC 578  shred  listed  in  Attachment  4  for  each  task/sub-task  in  order  to  capture  the predominant  type  of  CLS  activity  being  accomplished  and  the  predominant  method  of accomplishment.    CLS  costs  are  direct  mission  costs  that  support  the  CLS  definition  in Paragraph 11.1.1. 11.2.1.2.  CAFDEx™ allows permitted users to access various Web-Based Systems (e.g., AMR,  DPEM,  WSMS,  and  SRMA)  to  extract  reports  or  view  data  in  a  centralized “Dashboard” format regardless of the backend of the Web Systems supporting the data.    80 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 CAFDEx™  allows  programs  to  manage  and  maintain  their  user  database  without requiring the skills of a Database Administrator. 11.2.1.3.  Step-by-step  directions  for  creating  the  requirements  are  documented  in  the WSMS 101 Training manual, which may be found in the drop down menu from the Help tab in the WSMS application. 11.3.  Minimum Contract Obligation (MCO) 11.3.1.  CLS requirements are typically connected to multiple product support elements.  As requirements  are  developed  and  translated  into  an  actual  contract  vehicle,  it  is  vitally important that personnel who capture CLS requirements collaborate with contracting officials to  ensure  a  common  understanding  exists  between  the  requirements  for  a  given  level  of service and the actual MCO.  Failure to adequately articulate the MCO prevents meaningful analysis of options during Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS) deliberations.  Likewise, it is  vitally  important  for  contracting  officials  to  fully  understand  the  importance  of  flexible provisions  in  a  variable  operating  environment  as  well  as  a  fiscally-constrained  operating environment;  the  objective  of  flexibility  is  the  same  but  the  approaches  are  from  different perspectives.    (See  paragraph  11.4.  below  and  AFI63-101/20-101,  paragraph  6.10.3.  for  a greater appreciation of these details). 11.3.2.  The  concept  of  the  MCO  is  somewhat  different  from  the  “fixed”  and  “variable” terms  used  for  many  years  when  discussing  CLS  requirements.    The  fixed  and  variable terminology was often misunderstood in application, resulting in non-standard interpretation during the various PPBE phases.  While these terms may seem intuitively obvious, in reality it  has  been  difficult  to  quickly  differentiate  requirements  that  are  truly  tied  to  a  minimum contract obligation from those that are not.  The MCO value identifies the minimum amount of funding per task per fiscal year that is required to avoid a contract default.  This is not to be  confused  with  the  requirement  value,  nor  anything  to  do  with  operational  availability, materiel availability, or any other metric; it is merely a contract-related question. 11.3.3.  The  MCO  amount  for  each  task  will  be  classified  according  to  the  relationship between  the  requirement  value  and  the  MCO  value.    Each  requirement  will  be  assigned  an “MCO Category.” 11.3.3.1.  The  MCO  Category  for  an  MCO  value  of  zero  in  a  given  year  will  be considered “Optional” for that year. 11.3.3.2.  The MCO Category for an MCO value that is greater than zero but less than the requirement value for a given year will be considered “Partial Must Pay” for that year.  If the  MCO  is  less  than  the  total  requirement,  the  level(s)  of  funding  flexibilities  (e.g., warranties, percent funded, hours of support, etc.) and impacts resulting from funding at level(s) less than 100% must be explained.  11.3.3.3.  The MCO Category for an MCO value that equals the requirement in  a given year  will  be  considered  “Full  Must  Pay”  for  that  year.   If  the  MCO  equals  the  total requirement, the rationale or specific contract language requiring 100% funding, and any penalties for funding less than 100%, must be explained. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   81 11.3.4.  When  properly  file  maintained  in  WSMS,  the  actual  contract  number  and  relevant contract  information  (e.g.,  option  years,  etc.)  are  linked  to  CLS  requirements  for  which  a contract already exists. 11.3.4.1.  When  a  contract  number  has  been  file  maintained  and  has  contract  years available in the FYDP, a True Cost is available for the task.  The premise of True Cost is if  a  contract  has  been  priced  out,  the  True  Cost  conveys the  actual cost of  the  contract; whereas if a contract has not been priced out, the base year cost is used and a SAF/FM factor will be used in the Funded Requirements Module (FRM) for out-year projections.  Such  differentiation  enables  more  informed  decisions  to  be  made  during  AFCS deliberations.  (See paragraph 11.5. for more details). 11.3.4.2.  If contract numbers are not properly file maintained in WSMS, it is impossible to indicate the MCO for a given task.  This only amplifies the importance of collaboration between key personnel to include requirements managers, contracting officials, etc. 11.3.5.  When contract numbers are file maintained properly, and the MCO field is available (as  described  above),  the  remaining  portion  of  the  requirement  not  considered  part  of  the MCO  is  associated  with  a  “Force  Structure  Impact.”    This  can  be  expressed  in  algebraic terms as: 11.3.5.1.  Task’s Total Requirement minus its MCO = X; where X is the [variable] value of the requirement that is dependent on a force structure element (file maintained by the requirements manager).  This “X-value” attribute is used to indicate the driving nature of the  difference  between  a  given  task’s  total  requirement  and  its  MCO  value.    The  “X-Value” can be linked to only one of the following options: 11.3.5.1.1.  “Fleet/Inventory” is used to characterize the “X-value” as dependent upon the fleet size or inventory of the weapon system.  For example, a requirement’s “X-value” may be reduced in relative proportion to a corresponding inventory reduction; whereas the MCO for this task would be independent of such an inventory reduction (fixed in nature). 11.3.5.1.2.  “Locations” is used to characterize the “X-value” as dependent upon the number  of  type  of  operating  locations  of  a  given  weapon  system.    For  example,  a requirement’s  “X-value”  may  be  reduced  in  relative  proportion  to  a  corresponding reduction  in  the  footprint  or  number  of  locations  from  which  the  weapon  system  is operated; whereas the MCO for this task would be independent of such a footprint or operating location reduction. 11.3.5.1.3.  “Operational  Hours”  is  used  to  characterize  the  “X-value”  as  dependent upon  the  number  of  operating  hours  of  a  given  weapon  system.    For  example,  a requirement’s  “X-value”  may  be  reduced  in  relative  proportion  to  a  corresponding decrease in operating hours; whereas the MCO for this task would be independent of such a reduction in operating hours. 11.3.5.1.4.  “None” is used to characterize the MCO value when the “X-value” is not dependent on any of the aforementioned options.  With the exception of instances in which  100%  of  a  requirement  is  considered  a  MCO  (also  referred  to  as  “Full  Must Pay”), in very rare circumstances is this option used.   82 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 11.3.5.1.5.  “Other”  is  also  used  in  extremely  rare  circumstances,  and  should  be accompanied  by  a  detailed  explanation  in  the  justification  section  located  on  the Risk/MCO tab in WSMS. 11.3.6.  More information on MCO, True Cost, and Force Structure can be found in the drop down menus from the Help tab in the WSMS application. 11.4.  PBL Requirements. 11.4.1.  Sustainment  requirements  and  tasks  for  PBL  contracts  are  interlinked  and  tied directly  to  customer  specified  system  performance  requirements,  and  give  a  contractor  the flexibility and incentives to achieve and maintain a sustainment capability necessary to meet specified system performance requirements.  The system level sustainment requirements will be tied directly to an aircraft flying hour program, system availability, equipment operating hours  or  some  other  user-defined  activity  level,  and  contract  performance  objectives,(  i.e., metrics).    Non-performance  based  (transactional)  contracts;  on  the  other  hand,  dictate  a specified  number  of  parts,  spare  engines,  engineering  support,  software  sustainment, technical  data  revisions,  corrosion  control,  paint/de-paint,  etc.    Since  performance  based contracts  assign  to  a  contractor  the  responsibility  for  meeting  system  level  performance measures, the contractor is  allowed to  allocate labor, material, equipment,  and funds across multiple  product  support  elements  to  meet  the  performance  standard  outlined  within  the contract, with the exception of construction or other improvements to real property (reference AFPAM 63-128).  PMs and customers are encouraged to communicate early and often, from requirements development processes throughout execution. 11.4.2.  Additionally,  when  defining  CLS  requirements,  it  is  imperative  that  contracting officials ensure that all CLS contracts are written in a manner to provide: 11.4.2.1.  Flexible  provisions  to  address  a  range  of  support  requirements,  so  as  to accommodate  changes  in  operational  tempo  (OPTEMPO)  or  execution  year  funding, including surge or contingency requirements to the extent that they can be defined. 11.4.2.2.  A  contract  structure  reflecting  a  work  breakdown  structure  that  supports assignment of a single CLS AFEEIC to each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the accounting system to facilitate accurately documenting and reporting funds obligated for CLS to the maximum extent possible. 11.4.2.3.  See  AFI63-101/20-101,  paragraph  6.10.3  for  a  more  broad  discussion  on performance-based CLS applications. 11.4.3.  The  MCO  is  used  to  communicate,  achieve,  and  maintain  a  specified  system capability  independent  of  system  size,  age,  or  activity  level,  i.e.,  these  tasks  must  be performed at all system levels, high or low, old or new.  Requirements tied to the MCO are needed  to  initiate  and  maintain  a  contracted  sustainment  effort.    Examples  can  include: Contractor Operated and Maintained Base Supply (COMBS) facilities and personnel; labor, engineering,  and  technical  support  in  the  field  or  at  depot,  sub-tier  supplier;  management, material  management  to  include  warehousing  and  distribution,  software,  tech  data management, etc. 11.4.4.  The remainder of PBL contract requirements generally exist to achieve and maintain a specified system capability that are dependent upon system size, age, or activity level, i.e., AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   83 increasing system level size, age, or activity will increase task requirements in order to meet the contracted system performance requirements.  These requirements may have fixed prices in the contract, but quantities and time tables may vary.  Note:  Tasks/requirements may be fixed  on  one  contract  and  variable  on  another,  depending  on  the  type  of  contract  awarded.  Examples can include replenishment of consumable and repairable parts, labor and material for repair of spares parts or engines, corrosion control, depot level repair and recovery teams, O&A  maintenance,  etc.    These  requirements  can  be  based  on  forecasts  from  AF  provided historical data and/or contractor developed models, or contractual negotiations.  Additionally, these requirements may be inextricably linked to other tasks, or dependent on requirements connected to the MCO. 11.5.  Inflating CLS Requirements: 11.5.1.  Requirements  statements  are  normally  prepared  using  current  year  dollar  values.  Since  the  PM  has  intimate  knowledge  of  the  CLS  requirements  and  contracts,  the requirements  preparer  has  the  flexibility  to  identify  if  a  requirement,  once  it  is  published, can/cannot be inflated with the SAF/FM approved rates.  The True Cost indicator is used for this purpose: 11.5.2.  For  priced  out  contracts  (meaning  contract  requirement  values  include  inflation):  The True Cost indicator is selected in the “RQMTs” tab.  This will prevent the SAF/FM rates from being applied to the years covered by the period of performance of the contract, but will allow  the  rates  to  be  applied  to  the  years  before  the  beginning  and  after  the  end  of  the contract.    In  order  for  the  True  Cost  indicator  to  be  selected,  the  contract  number  and Contract Line Item Number have to be input in the “Attributes” tab. 11.5.3.  For non-priced out contracts or no contract:  The True Cost indicator is not selected or available.  This will allow the SAF/FM rates to be applied to all the years. 11.6.  CLS Funding. 11.6.1.  IAW AFI 65-601Vol. 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, use EEIC 578 to identify CLS costs.  CLS costs are direct mission costs that support the CLS definition in Paragraph 11.1.1. 11.7.  CLS Multiple Fund Source Requirement. 11.7.1.  Each  Funds  Holder,  including  CAM,  contributes  a  pro-rata  share  of  CLS  costs  for each system used.  The pro-rata CLS share for each is based on the percentage of the total AF inventory  for  the  system  being  funded.    Exceptions  to  multi-funded  requirements  will  be made  when  the  majority  of  tasks  within  the  requirement  are  not  cost-shared  among  Funds Holders  or  the  majority  of  the  total  requirement  belongs  to  one  Funds  Holder.    These percentages are computed as follows: 11.7.1.1.  Determine  the  total  USAF  inventory  and  the  quantity  operated  by  each  fund source. 11.7.1.2.  Calculate  the  percentage  of  the  total  inventory  operated  by  each  fund  source.  Divide the fund source inventory quantity by the total AF inventory to arrive at the fund source percentage.   84 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 11.7.1.3.  Multiply  the  total  FY  CLS  cost  by  each  fund  source’s  percentage  of  the  total system  inventory.    This  is  the  amount  to  be  programmed  and  budgeted  by  each  funds source. 11.7.1.4.  Use this method for each FY included in the CLS requirement. 11.7.2.  Each fund source level of funding in the year of execution is generally based on the pro-rata share of the requirement.  Additionally, during the execution year, each fund source chooses when to provide funding/portions of funding based on the PM execution projection. 11.7.3.  O&M funds are available for new obligations in the year they are appropriated; at the end of that first year, O&M funds move to expired status for an additional five year period.   During the expired period, valid O&M obligations are liquidated and are no longer available for  new  obligations  (e.g.,  increasing  contract  scope,  increasing  quantities,  etc.).    Obligation increases  are  permitted  during  the  expired  year  period  for  valid  within-scope  changes  and other  administrative  type  actions  (award/incentive  fees,  correcting  accounting  errors,  etc.).  (See AFI 65-601 V1, Chapter 6, Expired and Canceled Appropriations.) AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   85 Chapter 12 WSS PROCESS AREA: SUSTAINING ENGINEERING (SUST ENG) REQUIREMENTS 12.1.  Overview. 12.1.1.  This chapter discusses the process for identifying Sust Eng requirements.  The formal title  for  Sust  Eng  is  “Sustaining  Maintenance  Engineering  by  Contract”  which  is  the  title used for the AF O&M 3400 appropriation, EEIC 583. 12.1.2.  Sust Eng Requirements are documented annually under the direction of the PM in the CAFDEx™ system.  It reflects total Sust Eng requirements for a program group.  It is used by  the  CAM  office,  HQ  AFRC,  NGB,  and  HQ  USAF  to  develop  POM  Sust  Eng requirements;  defend  these  requirements  in  the  POM  and  assist  in  developing  execution plans. 12.2.  General. 12.2.1.  Sust  Eng  Funding  Propriety:    Sust  Eng  includes  engineering  efforts  required  to review, assess, define, and resolve technical or supportability deficiencies revealed in fielded systems.  The general objective is to sustain the fielded system to the approved specification.  Sust  Eng  is  a  subset  of  Maintenance  Engineering,  which  is  a  subset  of  Weapon  System Engineering. 12.2.2.  Weapon System Engineering is separated into three main categories:  Development   Development Engineering,  Production  Engineering,  and  Maintenance  Engineering. Engineering  efforts  are  funded  with  the  RDT&E  3600  appropriation.   Production Engineering efforts are funded with one of the procurement appropriations (i.e., 3010, 3011, 3020,  or  3080).    Maintenance  Engineering  efforts  are  funded  with  the  AF  O&M  3400 appropriation.    The  following  discussion  provides  some  guidelines  in  identifying  the  funds' propriety  for  engineering  efforts.    Ultimately,  the  CAM  office  and  participating  customers (e.g.,  HQ  AFRC/NGB),  in  conjunction  with  the  program  group,  are  responsible  for  all funding decisions. 12.3.  Identifying Appropriate Weapon System Engineering Type. in the  current 12.3.1.  Characteristics  of  Development  Engineering  efforts  include  achieving  (e.g.,  new products)  or  substantially  improving  (e.g.,  fielded  products)  performance  beyond  levels specified Initial  Capabilities  Document/Capabilities  Development Document/Capabilities  Production  Document  (ICD/CDD/CPD).    Also  using  or  integrating immature  or  unproven  technologies  (e.g.,  moderate  to  high  risk  in  the  areas  of  technology, cost,  schedule,  or  performance),  establishing  a  new  stock  number  for  the  end  item,  and/or application  to  pre-production  systems  or  products.    Engineering  efforts  possessing  one  or more of these characteristics may be best funded under the RDT&E (3600) appropriation. 12.3.2.  Characteristics  of  Production  Engineering  efforts  include  engineering  efforts required to plan, design, and develop tooling, materials, quality assurance, and manufacturing procedures  necessary  to  achieve  a  cost  effective  and  producible  production  article.  Production  Engineering  is  generally  characterized  by  efforts  expended  to  prepare  an  article for manufacturing and/or installation.  As Production Engineering relates to fielded systems,   86 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 its focus is to correct deficiencies in the production baseline that are identified during test or in operational service.  This applies to both first-run production and modification/upgrades. 12.3.3.  Characteristics  of Maintenance  Engineering,  of which Sust  Eng is  a subset, include engineering efforts required to review, assess, define, and resolve technical or supportability deficiencies revealed in fielded systems, products, and materials.  The general objective is to sustain  the  fielded  system,  product,  or  materiel  to  the  approved  specification  capability.  Maintenance  engineering  efforts  may  lead  to  Development  and/or  Production  Engineering efforts. 12.3.4.  During  the  requirements  definition  phase,  all  participants  review  and  validate  the Sust  Eng  task  requirements.    Propriety  of  funding  is  also  validated  at  this  time.    Upon issuance  of  the  commitment/obligating  document,  e.g.,  Purchase  Request  (PR),  Project Order, AF Form 616, Fund Cite Authorization (FCA), propriety of funds is validated by the local FM Comptroller office. 12.3.5.  When preparing a Sust Eng requirement task, one of the initial steps is to confirm the work to be done falls within the scope of Maintenance Engineering.  Refer to Paragraph 12.5 for guidance on the characteristics of Sust Eng efforts.  In the cases when the PM is unable to make the appropriation or EEIC determination, the PM shall request a determination from the center’s FM organization and paying customer.  The PM shall document what decision was made and the rationale used in making that decision. 12.3.6.  The Decision  Tree for Funding  Product  Deficiency Resolution, contains criteria for identifying  the  appropriate  method  of  funding  product  deficiency  identification  and resolution,  respectively.    The  OPR  to  determine  the  source  of  funding  is  either  the  CAM office (i.e., HQ AFMC/FMB) or the Working Capital Fund Division (i.e., HQ AFMC/FMR).  The specific funding guidance of the applicable program should be pursued.  (See Paragraph 12.1) AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   87 Figure 12.1.  Decision Tree for Funding Product Deficiency Resolution. A. Is Deficiency Item Related? Yes Fund Investigation with CSAG-S or GSD Funds No/Undetermined Fund Investigation with Appropriated Funds Note: In this decision process, the term “item” refers to stock-listed AFWCF managed products that are either Budget Code 8 (CSAG-S) or Budget Code 9 (GSD). Decision Node Notes: B. Did Investigation Confirm Deficiency is Item related? Yes C. Is the Deficiency Restricted to the Item? Yes No No Fund Engineering for Deficiency Resolution with Appropriated Funds Fund Engineering for Deficiency Resolution with CSAG-S or GSD Funds Decision Node A:  Is deficiency item related? Discussion:  This may be difficult to determine initially.  System deficiencies may appear as item failures.  If there is doubt or insufficient evidence to isolate the deficiency, use an appropriated account to fund the engineering for the initial investigation.  Refer to AFI 65-601 for definitions of the weapon system engineering categories and associated funding. Decision Node B:  Did investigation confirm root deficiency as item related? Discussion:  The investigation should reveal the root cause of the deficiency and isolate it to a system, subsystem, or component/item.  If the deficiency does not reside at the item level, use an appropriated account to fund the engineering for deficiency resolution.  If the deficiency does reside at the item level, an additional question must be answered. Decision Node C:  Is deficiency restricted to item? Discussion:  The preferred resolution for an item deficiency may be to introduce a change at the subsystem or system level (e.g., a modification or upgrade).  If this is the case, and the change is outside AFWCF managed products, use an appropriated account to fund the engineering for deficiency resolution.  Otherwise, use the CSAG-S or CSAG-R to fund this engineering.

Identifying Appropriate EEIC. 12.4.1.  Maintenance  Engineering  efforts  are  charged  to  the  appropriate  O&M  3400 appropriation  EEIC  and  its  applicability  to  the  deficiency.    Maintenance  Engineering  costs for  systems,  or  commercial  part(s)  of  the  system,  operated  under  CLS  are  accounted  for under  EEIC  578  (57834,  57836).    All  Sust  Eng  efforts  on  organically  supported  systems falling within the criteria identified in the EEIC 583 definition are charged to EEIC 583. 12.5.  Sustaining (Maintenance) Engineering “by Contract”. 12.5.1.  The Definition of Sustaining (Maintenance) Engineering by Contract:  Accounts for contractual  costs  of  engineering  efforts  on  systems,  products  or  materials  required  for investigating,  identifying  and  resolving  technical  or  supportability  deficiencies  revealed  in operational service.  Includes, but is not limited to, assessing deficiency indicators; defining the  characteristics  and  cause  of  such  deficiencies;  determining  the  impact  on  the  affected system;  identifying  and  evaluating  alternative  solutions;  determining  the  preferred solution; and  designing,  integrating  and  validating  the  solution.    This  consists  of  all  associated contractual  efforts  for  engineering  and  technical  data,  report  generation,  modeling, simulation, testing, etc. which are integral to the completion of the overall engineering task. 12.5.2.  The phrase "by Contract" in the title does not limit the use of EEIC 583 funding to formal  contracts.    It  simply  refers  to  the  concept  of  a  contract  (i.e.,  an  agreement  between competent  parties  regarding  proper  subject  matter  which  includes  consideration  and obligation  among  the  parties).    EEIC  583  funds  may  be  used  to  fund  only  non-government activity  which  requires  financial  resources  to  provide  the  desired  Sust  Eng  support.    EEIC 583  is  intended  to  capture  costs  associated  with  contracts  for  Sust  Eng  activities,  including the  cost  of  any  administrative  pass-through  charges  from  government  agencies.    The following exception is defined: 12.5.2.1.  Use RDT&E to fund all efforts to improve engine components (a combination of maintenance and development engineering) per Congressional direction. 12.5.3.  Sust Eng can be used when the PM: 12.5.3.1.  Lacks  organic  engineering  resources  to  respond  to  the  engineering  tasks, referenced in the definition, that are critical in time, scope, or complexity; 12.5.3.2.  does  not  have  access  to  required  engineering  data  to  perform  the  engineering task, and; 12.5.3.3.  does not have the facilities needed to accomplish engineering tasks. 12.5.4.  Examples  of  Sust  Eng  activities  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  engineering  to support compliance with environmental protection directives; analysis of system, or materiel deficiencies;  ESOH  hazard  identification,  risk  assessment,  and  mitigation  measures;  failure analysis;  mishap/safety  investigations;  reverse  engineering;  engineering  studies  to  identify the  depth  of,  and  replacement  solutions  for,  unsupportable  sub-systems  or  components; structural integrity analysis; aging & surveillance testing and analysis of energetic items (i.e., warheads,  rocket  motors,  explosive  bolts,  etc.);  engineering  analysis  to  support  FAA requirements;  test  articles;  and  physical  and/or  computer  modeling  for  the  purpose  of validating solutions.  Note:  Do NOT create tasks in any Category for PMA work.  PMA is cost which supports the operation of a Program Office in its management and oversight role.  AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   89 PMA includes costs such as travel, office printing, supplies, equipment, and Program Office unique computer and communication costs.  Advisory and Assistance Service and Federally Funded Research and Development 12.6.  Government Organic Sust Eng. 12.6.1.  Identifying Government Organic Sust Eng.  Due diligence needs to be accomplished prior to determining that Government Organic Sust Eng is more cost effective to the AF than Contract Sust Eng. 12.6.2.  Documenting  Government  Organic  Sust  Eng  work.    PM  buyer  requests  a  PCN(s) from MP&E.  RGC of the PCN should be relative to the highest system level of the Sust Eng project (i.e., unprogrammed OMEI  = “H”, software  = “S”, etc.).  The PCN  will be used  as the  beginning  of  the  task  title  in  CAFDEx™  (Example:    PCNXXX  –  Break  investigation study).  The government (organic) Sust Eng effort can referenced/tracked in the pseudo task field.  The Sust Eng task/project/Web-System Control Number (WCN) should be referenced in  the  “remarks”  block  within  MP&E.    After  receipt  of  PCN(s),  follow  G004C  protocol, including Funds Classification reference Number request(s).  Generate an AFMC Form 206 (Temporary Work Request ~ not a funding document), include Sust Eng task/project/WCN in the  special  instructions.    Generate  an  AFMC  Form  “181”  (Project  Order  ~  funding document),  include  Sust  Eng  task/project/WCN  and  AFMC  Form  206  number.    All  CAM Organic  Sust  Eng  task  PCNs  should  begin  with  the  appropriate  Customer  Code:    (A  = AFMC/CAM, B = NGB, and Z = AFRC). 12.6.3.  Any  Sust  Eng task  that  is  identified  as  organic  under  the  AFEEIC  583OR  needs  to document the hours associated with the requirement dollars.  Associated calculations must be documented and provided as well. 12.7.  Sust Eng Funding. 12.7.1.  Programming and Budgeting Sust Eng Funds.  Sust Eng funds are programmed and budgeted by the program groups through the CAM office and Funds Holders.  The method used  to  allot  funding  to  the  PM  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  CAM  office  and  Funds  Holders.  The  CAM  office  and  Funds  Holders  decide  the  amount  of  actual  funding  and  when  the funding will be released. 12.7.2.  Sharing  Sust  Eng  requirements  between  Funds  Holders.    Funds  Holders  often contribute a pro-rata share of Sust Eng costs for the systems they use.  The pro-rata Sust Eng share  for  Funds  Holders  is  based  on  their  percentage  of  the  total  AF  weapon  system inventory, considering each system separately.  These percentages are computed as follows: 12.7.2.1.  Determine  the  total  AF  inventory  and  then  the  quantity  operated  by  active, reserve,  and  guard  forces.    The  breakout  of  weapon  system  inventories  may  be  derived from  the  "Current  Versus  Previous  Program:    Total  Active  Inventory  Flying  Hours" report.    This  inventory  report  has  the  Data  System  Designator  of  Q-K008-Q6X-QT-MQT.  HQ AFMC/XPX (i.e., Directorate of Plans and Programs, Plans Division) is the OPR for this document. 12.7.2.2.  Calculate  the  percentage  of  the  total  inventory  by  system,  operated  by  each activity.   90 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 12.7.2.3.  Multiply  the  total  FY  Sust  Eng  cost  by  each  activity's  percentage  of  the  total system inventory.  This is the amount to be programmed and budgeted for by the CAM office and Funds Holders. 12.7.3.  HQ  AFRC  or  the  NGB  may  identify  requirements  unique  to  their  systems/mission.  In this case HQ AFRC or the NGB funds 100% of the effort.  These unique requirements are identified in CAFDEx™. 12.8.  Duties and Task. 12.8.1.  Lead Commands POCs. 12.8.1.1.  The  Lead  Command  POC  is  responsible  for  obtaining  Funds  Holders coordination  on  all  Sust  Eng  requirements  validation  and  prioritizations  where  Funds Holders contribute funding. 12.8.1.2.  Lead  Commands  POCs  are  assigned  to  each  system  with  Sust  Eng requirements.  Information regarding the Lead Command concept and responsibilities can be  found  in  AFPD  10-9,  Lead  Operating  Command  Weapon  Systems.    When  a  Lead Command  cannot  be  identified  for  a  specific  program  group  through  mutual  agreement between the MAJCOMs and PM, HQ USAF/DCS Installation and Logistics, Directorate of  Supply,  Aircraft/Missile  Support  Division  (USAF/A4P)  will  make  a  Lead  Command responsibility decision. 12.8.2.  Funds Holders. 12.8.2.1.  Funds  Holders  are  responsible  for  working  with  the  Lead  Commands  in validating,  prioritizing and budgeting Sust  Eng  requirements for those  systems they use as outlined by AFPD 10-9.  Funds Holders all contribute funding for their pro-rata share of Sust Eng costs. 12.8.3.  HQ AFMC. 12.8.3.1.  HQ  AFMC  is  the  Lead  Command  for  several  cross-cutting  and  common program groups with OAC 87.  The CAM office is responsible for fulfilling AFMC Lead Command responsibilities with regards to Sust Eng requirements. 12.8.3.2.  OAC  47  is  assigned  to  HQ  AFMC,  which  is  responsible  for  PMA  costs  as shown in Figure 12.2. Figure 12.2.  Appropriation 3400 Responsibility. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   91 12.8.4.  AFMC Program Groups. 12.8.4.1.  Program  groups  are  responsible  for  identifying,  documenting,  validating  and prioritizing Sust Eng requirements. 12.8.4.2.  The  program  group  will  collaborate  Sust  Eng  requirements  with  the  Lead Command POC, Funds Holders, and supporting organizations, internal and external. 12.8.4.3.  The  PM  may  delegate  authority  to  a  subordinate  within  the    organization  to work Sust Eng issues but final responsibility remains with the PM. 12.9.  Sust Eng Process. 12.9.1.  Introduction.  The purpose of the Sust Eng process is to provide a vehicle where Sust Eng  requirements  can  be  better  identified  and  linked  to  the  budgeting  process.    It  also provides a forum where program group, Lead Commands POCs, and Funds Holders jointly review  and  communicate  Sust  Eng  requirement  concerns  and  issues.    The  process  output products provide a link between Sust Eng requirements and the budgeting process. 12.9.2.  Sust Eng Description. 12.9.2.1.  The  Sust  Eng  requirements  are  those  engineering  efforts  required  to  review, assess,  define,  and  resolve  technical  or  supportability  deficiencies  revealed  in  fielded systems, products, and materials.  These requirements are documented in CAFDEx™ by program group. 12.9.2.2.  Systems or products with two or more Program Elements (PE)s with common requirements (e.g., Air-to-Ground Missile (AGM)-86/86B) may be consolidated into one program  group.  The  program  group  is  responsible  for  consolidating  Sust  Eng requirements. 12.9.2.3.  All  dollar  amounts  are  in  current  year  dollars  with  the  base  year  being  the current FY. 12.10.  Sust Eng Requirements Format and Preparation: 12.10.1.  Sust Eng Requirements documentation is divided into three parts.  The first part is called  Program  Information.    It  contains  a  short  program  description,  identifies  the  person who  prepared  the  requirement,  the  PM  and  lead  command.    The  second  part  is  called  the Requirements  Summary.    It  identifies  the  prior,  current  and  budget  year  respectively,  and Outyear  Sust  Eng  funds  needed  to  accomplish  the  Sust  Eng  tasks.  It  is  the  link  to  the budgeting  process.    The  third  part  is  called  the  Category/Task  Details.    It  identifies  budget year  and  out  year  Sust  Eng  category/task  requirements  by  describing  the  deficiency  that generated  the  Sust  Eng  task,  the  impact  if  the  requirement  is  not  funded,  and  the  required funds  to  accomplish  the  Sust  Eng  task.    Sust  Eng  requirements  are  prepared  using  the CAFDEx™  software  system.    Access  permission  to  CAFDEx™  site  is  obtainable  at: https://aplhiis.hill.af.mil/CAFDEx/CAFDEx_home.aspx. 12.10.1.1.  Part 1, Program Information. 12.10.1.2.  Program  Information  is  the  first  section  of  the  Sust  Eng  requirements.    It contains  a  brief  description  of  the  program.    Preparers  should  use  the  section  to  inform and share program information.  Information may be general or specific in nature but it must apply.  The PMD should be identified in the description as well as the most recent   92 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 PMD  change  and  change  date.    Other  pertinent  and/or  important  program  authorization information would be appropriate for inclusion. 12.10.1.3.  The  requirements  preparer  is  identified  in  this  section.    Provide  preparers name,  office  symbol,  and  DSN  or  commercial  telephone  number.    It  also  is  used  to identify the program group and lead command authorities. 12.10.2.  Part 2, Requirements Summary. 12.10.2.1.  The  Requirements  Summary  is  a  summary  of  program  Sust  Eng  costs.    It  is divided  into  aircraft  and  non-aircraft  program  groups.    For  aircraft  program  groups,  the categories  are  System  Safety,  Integrity  Programs  for  Weapon  Systems  and  Systems Engineering.    For  non-aircraft  program  groups,  the  categories  are  System  Safety  and Systems Engineering.  Centers contractor support to  a Program Office is also PMA if it supports  the  functions  of  government  personnel  in  managing  a  weapon  system  or common item. 12.10.2.2.  Costs  are  expressed  for  each  task,  beginning  with  System  Safety  tasks,  then Integrity  Program  tasks,  Systems  Engineering  tasks  and  last,  for  Completed/Deleted tasks.   The costs are in  sequence  for Last (Prior)  Fiscal  Year,  the Current (Base)  Fiscal Year,  and  then  the  Delta  (Last  minus  Current).    Delta  amounts  are  positive  or  negative with negatives in parenthesis.  Subtotals are entered at the end of each category of tasks with a Grand Total following the subtotal for the Systems Engineering tasks.  Costs are included for Completed and Deleted tasks in  order to maintain  continuity for prior year requirements  from  one  AMR  Brochure  year  to  the  next  and  from  Last  to  Current requirements  within  the  module.    If  tasks  have  no  current  or  future  year  requirements, they should be moved to the Archived category for one year.  Then they may be deleted from  the  requirement  completely  the  following  year,  after  fiscal  year  rollover  has  been accomplished. 12.10.2.3.  The  next  area  of  the  Requirements  Summary  is  the  Funding  Distribution section.  The funding distribution section allows the Sust Eng preparer to identify all the Funds  Holders  which  provide  funding  for  the  program  and  the  amount  of  Sust  Eng expense  allocated to  each  fund  holders  based  upon  portion  of  the  “fleet”  each  operates.  Funding Distribution may be different for some tasks (e.g., a particular task pertains to a MDS or subsystem where the prorated distribution is different than total fleet size, may have FMS participation in funding, or may be unique to an individual funds holder). 12.10.3.  Part 3, Category/Task Detail. 12.10.3.1.  For  aircraft  program  groups,  the  categories  are  System  Safety,  Integrity Programs  for  Weapon  Systems,  and  Systems  Engineering.    For  non-aircraft  program groups, the categories are System Safety and Systems Engineering.  The program group can add other categories with coordination from the lead command. 12.10.3.2.  Within the Systems Safety category for aircraft and non-aircraft systems, there are  3  subcategories:    Mission  Critical  Rapid  Response,  Mishap  Investigations,  and System Safety Management Support.  The last category may be used for proactive tasks to identify Environment, Safety, and Occupational (ESOH) hazards, assesses the ESOH risks, and prevent or minimize the ESOH risk. The Safety category contains all Sust Eng Requirements safety  board all  mishaps addressing for investigating and AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   93 recommendations.    (Note:  When  funding  a  Deficiency  Report,  ensure  to  include  root cause analysis when determining if deficiency is system or component.) 12.10.3.3.  For aircraft systems only, the Integrity Program subcategories include; ASIP, MIL-STD-1530;  DoD  Standard  Practice:  Aircraft  Structural  Integrity Program  (ASIP), MIL-STD-1796,  Avionics  Integrity  Program  (AVIP);  Mechanical  Equipment  and  Sub-Systems  Integrity  Program,  MIL-STD-1798,  Mechanical  Equipment  and  Sub-Systems Integrity  Program  (MECSIP);  Propulsion  System  Integrity  Program,  MIL-STD-3024, Propulsion  System  Integrity  Program;  Air  Vehicle  Low  Observable  Integrity  Program, MIL-HDBK-513,  Air  Vehicle  Low  Observable  Integrity  Program  General  Guidelines.  (Note:    Second  order  tasks  resulting  from  an  initial  or  baseline integrity  task  should  be included under Systems Engineering, not Integrity Programs category.) 12.10.3.4.  Within  the  Systems  Engineering  category,  for  aircraft  and  non-aircraft systems, tasks fall into two basic types of tasks, recurring and nonrecurring.  Ensure the description  includes  identification  as  recurring  or  non-recurring  task.    The  Systems Engineering  category  contains  all  the  Sust  Eng  requirements  that  are  not  in  the  other categories.    Break  out  categories  into  known  individual  Sust  Eng  requirements  (i.e., tasks), each reflecting the required funding level.  Each task shown must have a priority, task  origination  year,  description,  impact  statement  and  Basis  of  Estimate  (BOE).  Remarks  are  helpful  and  offer  an  opportunity  for  preparer  to  share  short,  cogent  data related to the task.  If the task requires only Fiscal Year Current Year (FYCY) funding, include  the  description  and  impact  statements,  but  show  zero  dollar  amounts  for  Fiscal Year Budget Year (FYBY) though FYBY+6 funding. 12.10.4.  There should be a general description of each category in the Sust Eng Requirement Plan (e.g., System Safety, Integrity Programs, Systems Engineering, and other categories as necessary.) 12.10.5.  The description of each task is a concise narrative and should be written so a person not  involved  with  the  program,  but  who  must  deal  with  requirements  and  budgetary processes, can understand the scope of the effort and could use the description to defend the requirement.  For nonrecurring Systems Engineering tasks, a generic task description should be used to program requirements for out-years in which specific deficiencies may not yet be known.    All  FYCY  and  FYBY  nonrecurring  tasks  should  only  address  specific,  known deficiencies.  All task descriptions should include numbers and cost information that support the  need  for  funds.    Some  general  information  to  be  applied  when  preparing  Sust  Eng requirements is: 12.10.5.1.  The FYBY amount is the total requirement, not funding received. 12.10.5.2.  The FYCY shows the task level requirements and sub-totals by category.  All additional tasks should be programmed for future years, or priorities adjusted accordingly and/or other lower priority tasks deferred. 12.11.  Additional guidance for developing task descriptions: 12.11.1.  The impact statements, Basis of Estimate narratives and/or remarks will include but are not limited to the following information:  Note: Standardized Task Description - Ensure that someone who is unfamiliar with the task can understand what is being described in each task.  Organize the task description as follows:   94 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 12.11.1.1.  Description of the Deficiency. 12.11.1.2.  How  does  this  deficiency  meet  the  requirements  for  funding  Product Deficiency Resolution? 12.11.1.3.  What is wrong with current tech data? 12.11.1.4.  Work to be performed by the contractor? 12.11.1.5.  What is the deliverable(s)? 12.11.1.6.  What is the reason that the program group cannot do the work? 12.11.1.7.  Additional background and justification.  If appropriate, provide the name of person or organization that identified the requirement. 12.11.1.8.  Number of failures. 12.11.1.9.  Types of failures. 12.11.1.10.  Cannot achieve established performance standards. 12.11.1.11.  Inspections required are excessive. 12.11.2.  The Impact Statement is a concise narrative that describes the consequences if the task is not funded.  A statement “will ground the fleet” is not specific enough, but the number of aircraft that will be grounded and on what dates this will occur would be.  For recurring engineering  type  tasks  that  can  be  de-scoped  to  a  lower  level  of  support,  provide  impact assessment for varying degrees of support.  First specify an intermediate level of funding and address  the  impact  of  funding  the  task  to  that  level.    Next  specify  the  absolute  minimum percentage of total funding required and the impact to the program of funding the task to only that  level.    Finally,  specify  what  the  impact  to  the  program  would  be  of  funding  the  task below the minimum level.  Include impact if the task schedule is slipped or delayed. 12.11.2.1.  Example  Impact  Statement.    “This  recurring  engineering  task  may  be  re-scoped.  At 70 % funding, on-call telephone support from the contractor would be limited to  2  hours  per  incident,  and  deficiencies  requiring  more  than  100  engineer-hours  to resolve  would  require  separate  task  order,  at  additional  cost,  for  resolution.    At  40% funding  the  contractor  help  desk  and  telephone  support  would  cease  to  exist.    Routine deficiencies  and  inquiries  requiring  more  than  eight  engineer-hours  to  resolve  would require  separate  task  order,  at  additional  cost  and  increased  contracting  delays.    There would be no in-flight emergency support, and other serious deficiencies could take weeks or  months  to  resolve.    Below  40%  funding  the  contractor  would  no  longer  support  the system.    Any  deficiencies  would  have  to  be  worked  under  an  individual  contract,  for resolution.    Required  engineering  expertise  may  not  be  readily  available  or  not  exist. Potentially, fleet-grounding deficiencies could take months or years to resolve.” 12.11.3.  BOE  narrative  shall  include  the  basis  for  the  PM’s  cost  estimate  of  the  funding required to support the task in the FYBY and FYBY+1 through +6. 12.11.4.  If applicable, assign an associated PBO to the Sust Eng task to further justify the requirement.  PBO development is accomplished via the WSA/PBO module in CAFDEx™ in accordance with the PBO guidance document provided on the CAM EIS Site inside the AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   95 PBO and WSA folder (https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx.) 12.11.5.  Each  program  group  validates,  prioritizes  and  publishes  requirements,  with  input from  the  lead  command,  HQ  AFRC  and/or  NGB,  other  PMs,  and  supporting  organizations annually.  The  objective  is  to  validate  and  prioritize  Sust  Eng  requirements,  along  with  all other  program  group  sustainment  requirements,  and  to  clarify  and  resolve  technical requirement issues.  Once requirements are prioritized, the program group publishes the final product.   96 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 13 WSS PROCESS AREA:  TECHNICAL ORDERS REQUIREMENTS 13.1.  Overview. 13.1.1.  This chapter details developing and documenting TO requirements. funded  by  O&M 13.1.2.  Post-acquisition/post-modification  TO appropriation  or  the  AFWCF  depending  on  the  source  which  purchased  the  acquisition  or modification of the system or end item.  Some TOs supporting the AMC mission are funded in the TWCF. requirements  are 13.1.3.  TO  requirements  in  this  chapter  include  O&M,  AFWCF  CSAG-S,  and  TWCF requirements. 13.1.4.  FMS of active USAF TOs result in costs to the AF which must be reimbursed.  Costs associated with FMS, however, are NOT included in LRDP requirements.  Detailed guidance on FMS TOs is provided in AFTO 00-5-19, Security Assistance Technical Order Program. 13.1.5.  Official  guidance  on  funding  technical  data  requirements  is  found  in  AFI  65-601, Vol. 1, Budget Guidance and Procedures, Chapter 4, Section 4E.  Policy direction for TOs is provided by AFPD 63-1/ 20-1, Integrated Life Cycle Management, and AFI 63-101/20-101, Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management  and  APFD  10-9,  Lead  Command  Designation  and Responsibilities for Weapon Systems. 13.2.  TO Requirements Development. 13.2.1.  Gather relevant information needed to develop a detailed requirement forecast for the FYDP.    All  documented  requirements  must  be  valid.    If  the  requirement  lacks  historical execution  data and the desire is  to keep  the requirement, reduce the requirement amount  to $1K,  otherwise  reduce  the  requirement  to  zero  and  the  requirement  will  automatically  be archived after one more requirements build cycle. 13.2.1.1.  Determine the appropriate source of funds for the TO requirement. 13.2.1.2.  Generally,  the  funding  used  to  acquire,  modify  or  sustain  the  end  item  of equipment or system determines the funding used to procure and print technical data (See AFI 65-601, Vol. 1, Chapter 4, Section 4E).  Refer questions on funds usage (e.g., EEICs to  use,  etc.)  to  the  local  FM  organization.    The  local  FM  organization  can  elevate questions as required to the appropriate HQ for resolution. 13.2.1.3.  Before  seeking  O&M  EEIC  594  funds,  the  TO  Manager  must  determine  if  a TO supports a NSN item managed in the AFWCF CSAG-S.  The appropriate IMS or ES for  the  item  should  be  contacted  when  uncertainty  as  to  whether  or  not  a  specific  TO should be funded in CSAG-S, contact the center CSAG-S overhead expense focal point for guidance. 13.2.1.4.  O&M  dollars  are  typically  used  for  TOs  on  fielded  systems  and  equipment originally procured with procurement appropriations (i.e., 3010, 3011, 3020, and 3080).  TO  requirements  include  activities  such  as  converting  source  data  to  standard  AF formats,  preparing  changes,  complete  revisions,  and  printing  TOs  in  traditional  paper AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   97 formats.  This  activity  will  include the support  of TO  media hardware, software  cost to view and utilize digitized TOs, and distribution such as Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals and PDFs.  EEIC 594 is used for technical data procurement activities, including T.O’s.  Many fielded system and equipment TO requirements are accounted for in EEIC 594  (59400  and  59451).    The  logistics  support  concept,  however,  may  result  in  TO requirements being included in other EEICs, such as the 578 (57837) series for CLS. 13.2.1.5.  O&M EEIC 594 requirements for a specific TO use only one PEC and are not split  among  multiple  PECs.    Requirements  for  a  specific  TO  are  also  not  split  between O&M and WCFs. 13.2.1.6.  AMC supports selected weapon system TOs in the TWCF.  Affected programs are provided specific instructions by AMC regarding the use of these funds.  Obligation and expenditure of TWCF funds must be in the appropriated FY. 13.2.2.  Evaluate  historical  usage  data  and  technical  requirements  to  maintain  and  deliver TOs in formats needed to meet the AF TO program objectives. 13.2.2.1.  A  source  to  consider  for  this  data  is  the  Comprehensive  AF  TO  Plan (CAFTOP).  The CAFTOP applies to all AF programs regardless of support concept and life  cycle,  or  funding  source.    The  CAFTOP  identifies  PM  and  lead  command  mutual agreements  about  sustainment  and  digitization  processes,  future  plans,  etc.    Each CAFTOP  is  a  management  plan  for  a  specific  list  of  documents.    CAFTOPs  establish technical  requirements  for  acquiring,  sustaining,  and  distributing  TOs.    CAFTOPs  also identify  current  status,  overall  health,  and  provide  a  future  roadmap  for  each  program’s TOs  to  include  plans,  schedules,  and  progress  in  converting  to  appropriate  digital formats. 13.2.2.2.  The AF Centralized TO Management committee, chaired by HQ AFMC/A4FI, sponsors a CAFTOP Work Group and has an:  EIM CAFTOP site. 13.2.2.3.  The CAFTOP Handbook located on the EIM CAFTOP site is managed by HQ AFMC/A4FI. 13.3.  TO Input Task Level Detail. 13.3.1.  Document the requirements at the task level in the CAFDEx™ WSMS Websystem 13.3.2.  To use  the WSMS Websystem, request access to  the CAFDEx™ application in  the AF Portal. 13.3.3.  If applicable, assign an associated PBO to the task to further justify the requirement.  PBO development is accomplished via the WSA/PBO module in CAFDEx™ in accordance with the guidance document provided on the CAM EIS Site inside the PBO and WSA folder (https://eis.af.mil/cs/cam/CAM%20Document%20Library/Forms/AllItems.aspx). 13.3.3.1.  TO  task  requirements  are  entered  under  three  Categories  in  WSMS:    Labor, Distribution, and Improvements. 13.3.3.2.  Labor tasks are for recurring level of effort sustainment work over the FYDP to keep  TOs  up-to-date  by  doing  page  changes,  complete  revisions  as  required  by  TO policy, or other work as appropriate for electronic media.   98 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 13.3.3.3.  Distribution  tasks  include  printing  paper  products,  producing  CD/DVDs,  or other work as appropriate for electronic media. 13.3.3.4.  Improvement  tasks  typically  are  efforts  which  can  be  accomplished  in  one  or two  years.    A  single  Improvement  task  with  a  requirement  across  the  FYDP  may  be entered, of course, but must be explained and justified.  Note:  Do NOT create tasks in any  Category  for  PMA  work.    PMA  is  cost  which  supports  the  operation  of  a  Program Office in its management and oversight role.  PMA includes costs such as travel, office printing, supplies, equipment, and Program Office unique computer and communication costs.   Advisory  and  Assistance  Service  and  Federally  Funded  Research  and Development Centers contractor support to a Program Office is also PMA if it supports the functions of government personnel in managing a weapon system or common item. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   99 Chapter 14 WSS OUT-OF-CYCLE (OOC) REQUIREMENT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 14.1.  Overview. 14.1.1.  The  OOC  process  is  used  to  identify,  validate,  coordinate,  document,  amend,  fund and request workload for requirements outside the normal requirements determination cycle.  OOC requirements are new or  changes to existing requirements that are not  documented in CAFDEx™  during  the  normal  requirements  process  that  are  driven  by  a  scope  change (change in quantity or level/type of effort) for operational safety, mission essential, change in supportability, or changes in technical data in the current execution year. 14.2.  OOC Requirement Criteria. 14.2.1.  DPEM  and  WSMS  requirements  that  have  any  requirement  change  that  drives  a revision  to  a  task  with  an  increase  or  decrease  of  more  than  10%  or  $100K,  or  an  hour change (increase or decrease) of more than 10% or 100 hours will require an OOC. 14.2.2.  AMRs  that  have  any  changes  to  the  number  of  a  quantity  driven  PCN,  or  an  hour change (increase or decrease) of more than 10% or 100 hours to an AMR Brochure task or a change  (increase  or  decrease)  to  a  dollar  quantified  PCN/task  of  more  than  10%  or  $100K will require an OOC. 14.2.3.  The following criteria above and listed in Table 14.1 below will be used to determine if an OOC is required. Table 14.1.  OOC Criteria. Requirement OOC Criteria DPEM Task New Requirement DPEM Task DPEM Task WSMS Task WSMS Task WSMS Task AMR Task AMR Task Requirement increase or decrease of more than 10% or $100K Hour change (increase or decrease) of more than 10% or 100 hours New Requirement Requirement increase or decrease of more than 10% or $100K Hour change (increase or decrease) of more than  10% or 100 hours Any changes (increase or decrease) to the number of a quantity driven PCN Requirement increase or decrease to a PCN/Task of more than 10% or $100K OOC Required Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes   100 AMR Task AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Hour change (increase or decrease) of more than  10% or 100 hours Yes 14.3.  OOC Package Process. 14.3.1.  The  automated  OOC  process  will  utilize  the  Coordination  Grid  in  the  Funded Requirements  Management  (FRM)  Module  of  CAFDEx™,  which  allows  Program  Offices, Funds  Holders,  and  Lead  Commands  to  electronically  coordinate  on  all  changes  to requirements. 14.3.1.1.  The Program Office will initiate requirements changes (increases/decreases) or add new requirements in the FRM module. 14.3.1.2.  All  changes  or  new  requirements  will  require  a  “Description  of  the  Change” and  “Justification”  in  the  Coordination  Grid.    Description  of  Change  must  include  the reason for the change (quantity, hour, occurrence factor changes, etc.), who will perform the work (Organic or Contractor), the source of funding (unfunded/internally funded) and information on tradeoffs by the change (WCN, PCN, Task Name, dollars). 14.3.1.3.  For organic requirements, the ALC will assist the PM in developing financial, technical  and  workload  impacts  and  identify  direct  labor  hours  and  direct/indirect material  costs.    (T-1)    The  PM  will  revise  published  AMR  Work  Specs  for  organic platforms, if required. 14.3.2.  Once  each  requirement  change  is  saved,  a  coordination  action  is  triggered  in  the FRM Coordination Grid. 14.3.2.1.  After  the  PM  or  PM  Designee  approves  the  change,  CAFDEx™  will automatically  notify  the  Lead  Command  and  Funds  Holder  via  email  that  their coordination  is  required.  The  FMB  analyst  coordination  of  the  requirement  does  not guarantee  funding  availability.    Funding  availability  is  dependent  upon  meeting  Air Force/Congressional  limitations  along  with  other  factors  such  as  current  program obligations,  limited  CR  authority  and  prioritized  necessity  among  other  WSS  program needs or shortfalls. 14.3.3.  If the OOC is approved, the Program Office will ensure CAFDEx™ is updated. 14.3.3.1.  If funding is available, the Funds Holders will align funds as appropriate. 14.3.3.2.  Execution.  If funded, follow the guidance in CAFDEx™.  The Step-by-Step-Procedures  are  in  the  FRM  subsystem  under  the  Help  menu;  follow  QRS  Sheets, Execution  Funds,  and  Execution  Year  Funding  Change-Quick  Reference,  and  take  the necessary actions to execute the new or updated requirement as required. 14.3.3.3.  For  organic  requirements,  once  funding  is  determined,  PM  will  utilize  the AFMC Form 206, Temporary Work Request, to document the work to be accomplished by  the  ALC  and reimburse  only  the  direct  labor  hours  and direct/indirect  material costs associated  with  the  new  requirement  or  changes  to  the  existing  requirement  for  the execution  year.    If  the  new  requirement  will  be  a  recurring  requirement,  it  should  be added in the next requirements build. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   101 14.3.3.4.  If the OOC request is Unfunded, follow the guidance in CAFDEx™/the CAM Step-by-Step-Procedures  guide  on  the  CAM  EIS  Site  in  the  Folder  titled  “General Information”. Note:  AFMC/FMR will not adjust the stabilized sales rates during the execution year for the new requirement; centers are compensated for the work performed on the AFMC Form 206.  If the requirement is a recurring requirement, out year sales rates should include the additional work when new sales rates are established. 14.4.  Disapproval Reconsideration. 14.4.1.  If an OOC is disapproved by the CAM office as being outside the scope of WSS and the  Program  Office  disagrees,  the  Program  Office  with  MAJCOM  support  can  ask  for reconsideration through the established process for policy readings: 14.4.2.  Program  FM  must  raise  their  concern  to  the  Center  FM.    If  Center  FM  agrees  that there is a question on the policy read, a formal request for redress is sent to AFMC/FMA. 14.4.3.  AFMC/FMA  will  then  examine  the  policy  question  that  has  been  submitted  by  the Center for final adjudication and provide written determination.   Note:  Any changes to the DPEM  organic  sales  rates  are  not  part  of  the  process  and  needs  to  be  worked  through AFMC/FMR.   102 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 15 CPFH:  DLRS AND CONSUMABLE SUPPLIES 15.1.  Overview. 15.1.1.  This  chapter  outlines  the  process  to  develop,  review,  validate  and  approve  CSAG-S/CSAG-Retail (R) base level spares requirements funded within the CPFH.  (Note:  NGB, AFRC,  TWCF  and  AFSOC  will  have  the  same  responsibilities listed under  the  Centralized Asset  Management  CAM  Program  Office  in  the  CSAG-S/CSAG-R  Requirements  Process.)  The processes in Chapter 15 are performed outside of CAFDEx™.  Note:  The Government Purchase Card (GPC) in not part of CAM CPFH program. 15.1.2.  CSAG-S  spares  are  DLRs  and  Consumables  Requirements  coded  AFEEIC  644XX, Budget Code 8. 15.1.3.  CSAG-R  are  Consumables  Requirements  coded  AFEEIC  605XX,  Budget  Code    9.  Note:  There are some exclusion’s to the CSAG-R policy based on Federal Stock Group as well as exceptions to the exclusions.  Questions should be addressed to HQ USAF A4P. 15.1.3.1.  CSAG spares supported by the CPFH Program are identified by: 15.1.3.2.  Customers.  Aircraft maintenance shops within Maintenance Groups to include flight  line,  back  shops,  aerospace  ground  equipment,  as  well  as  Operations  Aircrew Flight Equipment. 15.1.3.3.  Supply Coding. 15.1.3.4.  Expendability Reparability Recoverability Code (ERRC),  must be XD, XF or XB, as identified in D043 Item Record. 15.1.3.5.  Budget Code.  Must be 8 or 9, Identified in D043 Item Record. 15.1.3.6.  AFEEIC.  Must be 644XX or 605XX derived in the supply system based on a combination of the customer supply account, ERRC and Budget Code. 15.2.  Baseline Validation. 15.2.1.  The  requirements  process  for  both  CSAG-S  and  CSAG-R  begins  upon  receipt  of  a call letter. 15.2.1.1.  AF/A4  will  send  out  a  call  beginning  with  the  Spares  Requirements  Review Board  (SRRB)  requirements  process  for  CSAG-S  IAW  AFI  23-120,  Air  Force  Spares Requirements  Review  Board.    Validation  of  the  baseline  data  is  an  integral  part  of  this process. 15.2.1.2.  SAF/FMC  will  send  out  a  call  requiring  validation  of  consumption  data  for CSAG-R. 15.2.2.  Baseline  consumption  by  weapon  system/NSN  for  each  of  the  Funds  Holders  is compiled  and  posted  to  the  AF  Total  Ownership  Cost  (AFTOC)  website.    The  weapon system historical baseline data contains 8 quarters of historical consumption. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   103 15.2.3.  MAJCOMs,  and  their  respective  bases  will  assist  CAM/Funds  Holders  with validation/maintenance of base-level CPFH supply accounts (i.e., organization (ORG)/Stock Record Account Numbers (SRAN).) and supply cost/consumption data. 15.2.4.  Validate  historical  and  future  hours.    Flying  hours  used  in  the  CSAG-S/CSAG-R requirements process will match those used in the D200 spares requirements process used by the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC). 15.3.  Requirements Process. 15.3.1.  CSAG-S Requirements are calculated using the SRRB Process. 15.3.1.1.  The requirements process is outlined in the SRRB Process Guide located online in  the  software  SRRB  tool,  listed  under  User  Guides.    The  process  calculates  a requirement based upon historical consumption at the NSN (i.e.,  eaches) level by MDS, adjusted  by  known  changes.    These  changes  are  posted  as  “Templates”  on  the  SRRB Input and Retrieval Tool. 15.3.1.2.  CPFH  Rates  are  developed  by  pricing  out  SRRB  “eaches”  (i.e.,  projected quantity  for  each  NSN),  totaling  the  cost  at  the  MDS  level  and  then  dividing  by  the projected flying hours. 15.3.2.  SAF/FMC builds CSAG-R Cost per Flying Hour rates based upon historical baseline and known adjustments. 15.3.2.1.  After  inclusion  of  any  known  adjustments  by  SAF/FMC,  validate  proposed CSAG-R rate and return to SAF/FMC. 15.4.  Finalize Requirements. 15.4.1.  CSAG-S  Rates  are  submitted  to  AF/A4P  then  passed  to  the  AFCAIG  for  use  in budgeting the Flying Hour Program. 15.4.2.  CSAG-R  Rates  are  approved  by  the  MAJCOM/Funds  Holder,  then  returned  to SAF/FMC for submittal and final approval by the Executive AFCAIG. 15.5.  Duties and Task. 15.5.1.  Each Funds Holder (i.e., CAM, NGB, AFRC, AFSOC, and TWCF) is responsible for developing their own CSAG-S requirements. 15.5.2.  Lead/supported  MAJCOMs  will  assist  with the  validation  of  ORG/SRAN maintenance,  variance  analysis,  and  requirements  development  through  the  SRRB  and AFCAIG processes.   104 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 16 CPFH:  AVIATION PETROLEUM, OIL, AND LUBRICANT REQUIREMENTS (AVPOL) 16.1.  Overview. 16.1.1.  AvPOL  Requirements  (i.e.,  EEIC  699  &  693).    (Note:  NGB,  AFRC,  TWCF  and AFSOC will have similar responsibilities and will work directly with SAF/FMC to develop their requirements.) 16.1.2.  Step  1.    SAF/FM  will  provide  CAM  and  MAJCOMs  the  approved  flying  hour program, force structure, AFCAIG rates and any updates. 16.1.3.  Step  2.    MAJCOM  support  may  be  required  to  answer  questions  resulting  from execution analysis and will work closely with their wing refueling document control officer IAW AFI 11-253, Managing Off-Station Purchases of Aviation Fuel and Ground Services. 16.1.4.  Step 3.  CAM will monitor funds control. 16.1.4.1.  CAM  will  address  execution  year  changes  within  available  resources  to  the extent possible.  Additional resource requests will be handled with SAF/FMB. 16.1.4.2.  CAM  and  all  MAJCOM  POCs  will  coordinate  activities  with  Wing  POCs  to assist in identifying and explaining variance drivers and resolve reimbursement issues. 16.1.5.  AFCAA will calculate aircraft internal burn rates and use those rates to calculate the CPFH AFCAIG rates. 16.1.5.1.  Burn  rates  are  formulated  using  actual  gallons  consumed  per  AFTOC  data divided  by  actual  flying  hours  flown  from  the  AF/A3-OR  flying  hour  reports  (or approved substitute). 16.1.5.2.  Burn rates calculated per MDS using AFTOC fuel consumption data from the Enterprise Business System and the flying hours from the AF/A3-OR flying hour report or approved substitute. 16.2.  Build Projected Requirements. 16.2.1.  Compute future AvPOL requirements. 16.2.2.  Step 1.  SAF/FM will identify financial planning targets to each MAJCOM for use in development  of  Execution  Plan  and  will  provide  planning  numbers  to  CAM  prior  to  the beginning of each FY.   The goal is to  have  planning  numbers from SAF/FM early August.  SAF/FM  will  provide  CAM  and  MAJCOMs  the  approved  flying  hour  program,  AFCAIG rates and any updates. 16.2.3.  Step  2.    SAF/FM  will  notify  CAM  of  any  MDS  movements  to  allow  CAM  to coordinate appropriate fuel card account changes with the AF Petroleum Agency. 16.2.4.  Step  3.    Funding  requirements  are  calculated  by  applying  approved  PB  fly  hours against  AFCAIG  CPFH  factors.    The  CPFH  factors  are  developed  by  converting  AvPOL burn  rates  into  hourly  cost  factors  using  OSD  provided  fuel  prices.    Several  scenarios  are generated to formulate “most likely” future needs. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   105 Chapter 17 O&M SUPPORT EQUIPMENT PURCHASES 17.1.  Overview. 17.1.1.  This  chapter  establishes  O&M  Support  Equipment  purchase  procedures  funded through CAM.  Specifically, it applies to equipment centrally procured with EEIC 638 O&M funds and assigned a budget code of “Y”.  It outlines the process for buys to include use of the  Equipment  Requirements  System  (ERS)  and  Asset  Distribution  List  (ADL),  as  well  as management of the Buy Lists and Unfunded Requirements Lists.  These processes are only applicable  to  the  purchase  of  O&M  Support  Equipment  (i.e.,  EEIC  638)  not  for  the equipment  repairs.    Those  repairs  fall  under  DPEM.    This  document  is  intended  to  provide overarching guidance and does not include specific processes unique to individual Centers or groups.  Each Center shall utilize this publication to define internal processes that will allow them  to  accomplish  successful  execution  of  O&M  support  equipment.    However,  the following process elements are to be followed by all Centers:  (T-1) 17.1.2.  Buy  List  changes  must  be  accomplished  in  ERS.    Use  the  “Buy  List”  screen  for deletions; and use the “Current Unfunded Priority List” for additions. 17.1.3.  Requisitions must be selected from the ADL, unless an alternative bed-down plan is in place having been coordinated and approved by the applicable ALC and MAJCOM POC.  Status of all selected requisitions must be updated in Stock Control System D035A.  O&M requirements  must  use  the  Support  Equipment  unique  tracking  mechanism  identified  in Paragraph 17.8.1. 17.1.3.1.  Agencies  using  an  alternative  bed-down  plan  must  identify  to  the  applicable IMS  and  MAJCOM  ERS  POCs  what  requisitions  will  be  funded  so  they  are  given  a “BV”  status  to  prevent  duplicate  funding.    This  ensures  accurate  funding  status  and accountability of support equipment requirements. 17.1.4.  Execution  Status  and  Procurement  Information  screens  within  ERS  must  be maintained  by  the  IMS,  D200C  (Requirements  Control  Officer  (RCO)),  and  executing Divisions’  FM.    The  IMS  will  ensure  complete  and  accurate  procurement  information  is included in ERS (reference AFMCMAN 23-4, Paragraph 1.14.4.5). 17.1.5.  IMS  must  ensure  they  cite  the  correct  PE  for  the  requirement  on  the  Purchase Request/Military  Interdepartmental  Purchase  Request  (PR/MIPR).    If  changes  are  made  to the PE or recipient MAJCOM, the IMS must notify their Officer of Primary Responsibility (OPR) to update ERS.  Funds managers MUST verify the PE is correct by viewing the buy list in ERS when coordinating on the PR/MIPR. 17.2.  Stakeholders. 17.2.1.  Equipment Policy Working Group (EPWG).  The EPWG is chaired by AF/A4LE and co-chaired  by  440  Supply  Chain  Operations  Squadron  (SCOS)  with  members  from  all  the MAJCOMs,  (including  their  Command  Equipment  Management  Offices  (CEMOs)),  404 SCMS,  plus  a  variety  of  personnel  working  the  Air  Force  Equipment  Management  System (AFEMS)  which   The  EPWG discusses/addresses  equipment  matters  and  seeks  input  and  provides  clear  and  effective the  PM,  635  SCOW,  and  437  SCOS. include   106 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 equipment  policy  and  guidance  on  equipment  requiring  formal  supply  property accountability.  The EPWG reviews, evaluates, and approves the status of current initiatives designed  to  improve  procedures/systems  and  provide  guidance  for  future  tasking’s.    The EPWG also discusses long range initiatives designed for enhancing equipment processes and assign  responsibility  for  pursuing  these  initiatives  as  directed  in  AFI  23-101,  Air  Force Materiel management, Paragraph 1.5.4. 17.2.1.1.  DAF  Major  Commands.    The  DAF,  Support  Equipment  O&M  funding  (i.e., AFEEICs  63812,  63883,  63884)  is  centralized  under  the  CAM  structure  (i.e.,  OAC  87) and will be POM’d and managed from a DAF perspective. 17.2.1.2.  NGB  and  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  funding  continues  to  be POM’d  and  managed  by  the  Guard  and  Reserves.    AFRC  and  NGB  funding  is  not centralized with DAF funding and should be managed by the Centers accordingly. 17.2.1.3.  Each  command  (i.e.,  DAF  MAJCOMs,  as  well  as  AFRC,  and  NGB)  will maintain a MAJCOM Support Equipment POC that works with their functional areas to assess the criticality of their requirements and record those assessments within ERS. 17.2.2.  The AFSC 404  SCMS.  404 SCMS acts as  the Support Equipment  functional  OPR for  equipment  requirements  and  overarching  policies  and  procedures  as  directed  in AFMCMAN  23-4,  Computation  of  Requirements  for  Equipment  Items.    They  act  as  an extension of the CAM office located at Wright Patterson AFB OH, and are an active member of the EPWG; 404 SCMS works closely with both the MAJCOMs and Centers in an attempt to  facilitate  the  process.    404  SCMS  comprises  RCOs,  Equipment  OPRs  and  IMS.  Henceforth, any reference to 404 SCMS will encompass one or more of these functions. 17.2.3.  CAM  Office.    The  404th  CAM  Budget  PM  is  responsible  for  receiving  SupportEquipment O&M funding in OAC 87; determining funds distribution to Centers; submitting Spend  Plan,  Execution  Plan  and  POM;  submitting  Budget  Authority  requirements  and estimated  award  dates;  and  monitoring  execution  of  funds.    As  noted  above,  404  SCMS  is considered an extension of the CAM office for O&M DAF Support Equipment. 17.2.4.  Center Equipment OPRs.  Each Center has an Equipment OPR(s) who receives and interprets  equipment  requirements  guidance  and  Support  Equipment  policy  guidance provided by 404 SCMS. 17.2.5.  D200C  RCOs.    In  partnership  with  their  FM  organizations,  RCOs  will  monitor execution of Buy List requirements; ensuring sufficient requirements are in work to obligate all funding and deleting non-executable requirements from the Buy List.  In conjunction with the executing groups, RCOs will utilize the Current Unfunded Priority List, (also referred to as the Unfunded Requirement (UFR)) to determine requirements that should be “flexed” or added to the Buy List. 17.2.6.  IMS.    The  IMS  is  responsible  for  monitoring  and  managing  their  Buy  List requirements  and  ensuring  NSNs  are  file  maintained  in  IAW  AFMCMAN  23-4  and  ERS.  (Detailed  file  maintenance  guidelines  are  provided  in  AFMCMAN  23-4,  located  on  E-Publishing site.) 17.2.6.1.  The  IMS  must  ensure  changes  to  the  Buy  List  are  quickly  identified  and appropriate actions are taken as described in this document. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   107 17.2.6.2.  The  IMS  is  responsible  for  coordinating  all  Buy  List  changes  with  the appropriate program or Logistics Manager. 17.2.6.3.  The IMS must ensure they update the Procurement Information screen in ERS with  the  executability  information  relayed  by  the  IPT.    This  includes  the  Min/Max quantities  across  the  FYDP,  non-recurring  cost,  the  latest  unit  cost,  source  of  the  unit cost, date of the unit cost receipt, contract number, contract expiration date, and contract Administrative Lead Time (ALT) (time to execute options) as well as the ALT to start a new  contract,  Production  Lead  Time,  and  the  remarks  and  the  reason  for  the  Min/Max constraints. 17.2.7.  Logistics/PM (LM/PM).  The Logistics/PM shall participate in the detailed analysis of each requirement to determine executability.  The PM shall also be prepared to provide the acquisition strategy for requirements to ensure the funding phase is logical and executable or provide and monitor a “get well plan” to make a ‘no buy’ item executable. 17.2.8.  Other  IPT  Members.    Other  IPT  members  shall  participate  in  the  detail  analysis  of each requirement to determine executability to the extent deemed necessary by the LM/PM. 17.3.  ERS. 17.3.1.  The ERS plays a vital role in the planning and budgeting processes.  Its data is used to  compile  and  defend  O&M  POMs,  O&M  Execution  Plan,  and  O&M  Spend  Plan submissions.   For  additional  ERS  information,  see  AFH  23-123,  Materiel  Management Handbook, and AFMCMAN 23-4” 17.4.  Criticality Assessment. 17.4.1.  The MAJCOMs POCs will assess the criticality of each of their O&M requirements.  This  assessment  will  be  used  in  the  development  of  the  Air  Force  Requirements  Planning List  (RPL),  which  ultimately  results  in  the  O&M  Buy  List  and  associated  UFR,  as  well  as forms the basis for the Spend Plan, Execution Plan, and POM submissions. 17.4.2.  Though  AFRC  and  NGB  retain  ownership  of  their  funding,  they  follow  the  same procedures regarding development of the Buy List (i.e., their priority assessments in ERS are the foundation for ERS to incorporate their requirements into the RPL, Buy List, and UFR.)  However, D200C RCOs will flex requirements to ensure the Buy List is equal to the funding that AFRC and NGB provide to AFMC. 17.4.3.  ERS will initially default all requirements to routine (Category 3).  MAJCOMs may change  their  requirements  to  critical  (Category  1)  or  important  (Category  2),  if  the requirement  meets  the  EPWG  (reference  Paragraph  17.2.1)  approved  definitions  below.  MAJCOMs may also defer (Category 4) the requirements.  MAJCOMs may update criticality on a continual basis. 17.4.4.  Critical. 17.4.4.1.  Work stoppage has or will occur with no work-around. 17.4.4.2.  Safety of flight/safety of troops affected. 17.4.4.3.  JCS project coded surge requirements.   108 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 17.4.4.4.  Status  of  Operational  Readiness  and  Training  System  (SORTS)  reportable requirement;  i.e.,  the  SORTS  rating  of  the  unit  has  been  downgraded  and  comments documented  in  the  current  SORTS  report  identify  the  particular  NSN  as  the  impacting item. 17.4.4.5.  Projected  delivery  date  will  not  allow  IOC  of  new  mission  or  conversions,  as applicable. 17.4.5.  Important: 17.4.5.1.  Current asset condition may cause work stoppage. 17.4.5.2.  Improved  safety  and  saved  resources  through  “latest  and  greatest  technology advances. 17.4.5.3.  Projected  delivery  date  does  not  allow  Full  Operational  Capability  (FOC)  of new mission or conversions, as applicable. 17.4.6.  Routine: 17.4.6.1.  ERS default for all requirements. 17.4.7.  Defer: 17.4.7.1.  The  MAJCOM  determines  there  is  no  need  to  satisfy  the  requirement  at  this time. 17.4.7.2.  The  MAJCOM  has  knowledge  the  requirement  will  be  reduced;  i.e.,  Base Realignment  and  Closure  (BRAC)  realignment;  Allowance  Standard/Allowance Authorization reduction. 17.4.7.3.  Base has non-preferred sub, but does not want a replacement.  Note:  The 404thBudget Program Office monitors unneeded Buy List changes for DAF O&M funding. 17.5.  Center Buy List. 17.5.1.  O&M.    CAM  has  increased  the  role  given  to  the  PMs  to  influence  the  O&M  Buy List.  As such, 404 SCMS will snapshot the ERS prioritization data early in July and provide the  proposed  Buy  List  and  RPL  to  the  D200C  RCOs  and  IMs  for  review  and  input.    Upon completion of the review by the IMS and D200C RCOs, the D200C RCOs will provide the proposed/reviewed  Buy  List  to  the  PMs  for  their  review  and  concurrence.    The  PMs  will accomplish the same type of assessment for AFRC and NGB requirements. 17.5.2.  The  review  will  include  an  assessment  to  validate  that  each  requirement  is  still executable  within  the  fiscal  year.    Also  during  this  time,  IMS  have  the  opportunity  to  add requirements to the Buy List, from the RPL, or delete requirements from the Buy List.  The IMS will  also be required to identify their  budget authority requirements for the fiscal year and  provide  estimated  obligation  dates  for  requirements  on  the  Buy  List.    The  IMS  will receive  the  baseline  list  in  early  July  and  will  have  until  mid-August  to  complete  their assessment and make changes within ERS. 17.5.3.  The  O&M  Buy  Lists  will  be  accessed  through  ERS.    The  Buy  Lists  identify  buy requirements  by  MAJCOM  and  PE  for  O&M.    D200C  RCOs  will  work  with  their  FM organizations  to  obtain  fund  sites.    Upon  receipt  of  the  Buy  Lists,  IMs  will  immediately begin preparation of PR or MIPR as applicable.  To assist in long term procurement planning AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   109 strategies,  budget  and  budget  +1  year  requirements  are  reflected  in  the  Requirements Planning List. 17.5.3.1.  The executability review accomplished by the IMs/D200C RCOs should result in Buy List that is executable.  However, issues occur during the fiscal year, which will result  in  some  requirements  becoming  non-executable.    It  is  imperative  that  D200C RCOs  focus  their  efforts  on  keeping  funds  aligned  to  executable  programs.    Detailed analysis of each requirement must be accomplished to ensure only requirements that are executable remain on the Buy List.  Immediately upon identification of a non-executable status,  the  requirement  must  be  deleted  from  the  appropriate  Buy  List  in  ERS;  and  the Procurement  Screen  in  ERS  must  be  updated.    For  non-executable  programs,  the  IMS will file maintain the maximum production quantity for the applicable fiscal year, explain the  reason the  NSN  is  non-executable,  as  well as  the  actions  planned  to  make  the NSN executable in the future.  This will remove the requirements for the NSN from the UFR, but  will  not  affect  the  ADL  since  requirements  may  be  satisfied  through  methods  other than procurement.  For non-procurable programs, the IMS will check the non-procurable box in ERS, explain the reason the NSN is non-procurable, as well as the actions being taken to support the requirements to include replacement NSN (if known). 17.5.4.  All  changes  will  be  maintained  in  ERS.    Deletions  will  be  made  through  the  “Buy List”  screen;  additions  will  be  made  through  the  “Current  Unfunded  Priority  List”  screen.  (Note: Responsibilities for Buy List changes are detailed in Paragraph 17.9.) 17.5.5.  404 SCMS will provide the HQ AFMC/A4F CAM office with a copy of the O&M Buy List for the upcoming FY NLT 1 September.  (T-1)  Changes after this submission will be  monitored  by  the  CAM  office.    Excessive  changes  could  result  in  the  CAM  office requiring  CAM  Governance  Board  Member,  or for additions/deletions to the Buy List. their  delegate,  approval 17.6.  Current Unfunded Priority List. 17.6.1.  ERS now provides the capability for MAJCOMs to continually assess and change the priority of their requirements for O&M on an on-going basis.  In addition, AFEMS data will be  incorporated  into  ERS  nightly.    This  results  in  daily  UFR  changes,  as  well  as  on-going reprioritization of the requisitions on the ADL. 17.6.2.  D200C RCOs must monitor the Buy List to determine when requirements from the UFR will be added to fully execute available funding.  It is especially important that D200C RCO  monitor  requirements  marked  Critical  or  Important  which  must  be  prioritized accordingly  (See  Paragraph  17.6.3).    Requirements  marked  Critical  or  Important  must  be funded first. 17.6.3.  Prior to unfunded requirements being flexed to the Buy List, the IMS and/or D200C RCO  must  ensure  the  requirement  is  supported  via  the  latest  D200C  computation/AFEMS and that the requirement can be executed by 30 September of the current fiscal year.  This is critical  since  the  UFR  reflects  gross  requirements  that  have  not  been  marked  as  “non-executable” or “non-procurable” in ERS. 17.6.4.  When  the  determination  is  made  regarding  which  requirements  will  be  flexed,  the D200C  RCO  will  immediately  make  the  adjustment  in  ERS  via  the  Current  Unfunded Priority  List.    Note:    The  requirements  must  be  flexed  to  the  Buy  List  prior  to  the  IMS   110 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 coding the requisition as BV (on contract) in Stock Control System D035A.  For additional status codes and definitions, see DLM 4000.25-1, Military Standard Requisitioning and Issue Procedures (MILSTRIP), Appendix 2.16.  If the IMS codes the requisition as BV prior to the requirement appearing on the Buy List in ERS, the requirement “drops” off the UFR and is not available/visible to flex.  This is an ERS procedural step that must be followed. 17.6.4.1.  If the IMS codes the requisition as BV in Stock Control System D035A prior to the D200C RCOs flexing the requirement in ERS to the Buy List, the corrective action is: The  IMS  must  undo  the  BV  in  Stock  Control  System  D035A;  the  requirement  will reappear on the ERS UFR upon the next daily update; the D200C RCOs can then flex the requirement  to  the  Buy  List;  and  finally,  the  IMS  can  recode  the  requisition  as  BV  in Stock Control System D035A. 17.6.5.  D200C  RCOs  must  ensure  the  IMS  updates  the  Procurement  Information  screens appropriately  for  those  items  on  the  UFR  that  are  non-procurable  or  non-executable.  Requirements  on  the  UFR  that  are  marked  “Critical”  will  be  assessed  for  executability  as quickly as possible and appropriate actions taken in ERS if it is determined the requirement cannot be executed in the fiscal year.  The “Important” requirements will also be addressed upon  completion  of  the  “Critical”  requirements.    The  IMS  MUST  include  a  sound explanation  in  ERS  of  why  the  requirement  cannot  be  executed.    This  information  will  be viewed  by  MAJCOMs  POCs,  and  will  be  included  in  PM  metrics;  therefore,  ensure  the reasons  reflected  in  ERS  are  accurate.    Since  MAJCOMs  can  adjust  the  criticality  of requirements  at  any  time,  it  is  incumbent  on  the  D200C  RCOs  to  review  the  UFR  on  a recurring  basis  to  ensure  “Critical”  and  “Important”  requirements  are  constantly  being addressed. 17.6.5.1.  When it is determined a NSN is no longer procurable, the IMS will update the Procurement Info screen by checking the non-procurable flag, providing a reason for its non-procurability in the Remarks block, and annotating the replacement NSN, if known. 17.6.5.2.  If  NSNs  on  the  UFR  are  deemed  non-executable  for  the  current  FY,  a  max quantity and reason shall be input to the Procurement Information screen. 17.6.5.3.  Specifically, if no quantities of the NSN are executable, a quantity of zero will be input in the max quantity field for the applicable FY in ERS and remarks entered to the Min/Max Constraint Reason block. 17.6.5.4.  If  the  quantity  that  can  be  executed  is  more  than  zero,  that  quantity  will  be input into ERS.  If that max quantity exceeds the quantity already on the Buy List, two actions  are  required:  (1)  input  the  max  quantity  and  remarks;  (2)  delete  the  non-executable  quantity  off  the  Buy  List  via  the  Maintain  Buy  List  Changes  screen  in  ERS (this action is  performed by the D200C RCOs  - internal IMS procedures for submitting Buy List changes will still be followed).  Note:  For all of these actions, the importance of sound documentation cannot be understated.  Clear, concise explanations are required in ERS. 17.7.  Requisitions. 17.7.1.  O&M.    The  IMS  will  be  responsible  for  selecting  the  appropriate  requisition(s) associated  with  the  Buy  List  requirements.    To  assist  the  IMS  in  identifying  the  correct AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   111 requisition for the Buy List requirement, the ADL includes the applicable MAJCOM and PE for each requisition.  The requisitions on the ADL are ranked IAW MAJCOM assessments. 17.7.1.1.  The  IMS  will  select  requisitions  for  the  MAJCOM  that  originated  the requirement.    The  IMS  should  start  at  the  top  of  the  ADL  (in  order  of  criticality assessment) and work down the list designated by level of importance. 17.7.1.2.  The IMS must assess which portions of the requirement are coded as “Critical” or “Important” to ensure the requisitions are split accordingly.  ONLY after all “Critical” and  “Important”  requirements  are  filled,  IMS  will  fill  as  many  of  the  valid  routine requirements as possible.  Invalid quantities or portions should be canceled using the FN cancelation code or IMS may work with the base or the ERS MAJCOM POC to get the invalid requisitions corrected, so they can be used on the PR/contract. 17.7.2.  The  IMS  will  select  the  requisition  when  PR  preparation  begins  and  include  the requisition on the PR when it is submitted; selecting the requisition while writing the PR will alert the IMS early in the process if insufficient requisitions are available to support the buy.  IMS  must  not  select  “Deferred  Requisition”  at  time  of  award;  IMS  will  ensure  no  changes have been made to the requisition. 17.7.3.  If  a  requisition  quantity  exceeds  the  Buy  List  quantity  for  that  MAJCOM,  the  IMS must “split” the requisition in Stock Control System D035A and cite the requisition with the correct  suffix  on  the  PR/contract.    It  is  extremely  important  that  this  step  be  performed correctly.    If  the  IMS  needs  assistance,  they  will  contact  their  D200C  RCO  to  obtain guidance  in  correctly  splitting  a  requisition.    (Note:  See  Paragraph  17.8  for  a  detailed explanation of Stock Control System D035A actions.) 17.7.4.  In some cases, there may be insufficient requisitions to support the Buy List quantity for the specific MAJCOM who requested the buy.  This could be because requirements were previously  supported  through  other  means  (e.g.,  repair  or  redistribution/distribution);  or  the MAJCOM  may  have  cancelled  requisitions.    Therefore,  when  there  are  insufficient requisitions  it  is  imperative  that  the  IMS  research  the  buy  to  ensure  it  is  still  valid  before proceeding. 17.7.5.  If the IMS determines the buy is no longer valid, then the IMS must initiate action to have the requirement removed from the Buy List; and stop the associated PR action.  In the event the PR has already been submitted, the IMS must immediately submit an amendment to cancel that portion of the PR. 17.7.6.  If the IMS determines the buy is still valid, then the IMS will proceed with one of the following options: 17.7.6.1.  It  is  suggested,  not  mandated,  that  the  IMS  and/or  D200C  RCO  contact  the appropriate  MAJCOM  Support  Equipment  OPR  when  insufficient  requisitions  are available on the ADL to support that MAJCOM’s validated requirement.  The purpose of the contact is to determine if the MAJCOM can submit a requisition or if there is a Stock Control System D035A/SBSS disconnect. 17.7.6.2.  The IMS will select an alternate requisition for a MAJCOM with the same PE, beginning at the top of the ADL and working down the list.  This change must be made in ERS  to  accurately  reflect  the  recipient  MAJCOM.    However,  the  decision  to  take  this   112 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 action  is  left  to  the  PM  since  they  will  be  responsible  for  addressing  the  issue  if  a MAJCOM questions the decision to ship the asset to another MAJCOM. 17.7.6.3.  If there are no requisitions for the MAJCOM or the PE, the IMS will select an alternate requisition that is “critical” or “important” for any other MAJCOM, beginning at the top of the ADL and working down the list.  However, this change must be made in ERS to accurately reflect the recipient MAJCOM.  Additionally, the PE must be changed on the PR to reflect the new/correct PE that matches the selected requisition; the PE must be accurately reflected on the PR in order to properly balance the funding. 17.7.6.4.  NGB/AFRC.    Only  requisitions  for  NGB  may  be  selected  for  NGB-funded requirements  (i.e.,  PEC  52844F),  and  only  requisitions  for  AFRC  may  be  selected  for AFRC-funded requirements (i.e., PEC 52834F). 17.7.7.  Basic  Expeditionary  Airfield  Resources  (BEAR).    BEAR  requisitions  will  be identified by the BEAR Program Office.  The BEAR Program Office will contact the IMS to discuss  the  BEAR  procurements  and  associated  requisitions.    BEAR-specific  procurements can be identified by their PEC 41135, which is reflected on the Buy List. 17.8.  Stock Control System D035A. 17.8.1.  O&M.  Upon selecting a requisition to place on a PR for a Buy List requirement, the IMS will update the status code and estimated shipping date (ESD) in Stock Control System D035A.    The  status  of  the  requisition  will  be  changed  to  reflect  “BV”,  with  an  Amended Shipping  Instruction  (ASI)  Contract  Field  Number  of  “013H”.    This  signifies  that  the requirement is on PR/MIPR and that the requirement is being funded with current year funds.  When  assigning  the  “BV”  status  code,  it  may  be  necessary  to  “split”  the  requisition  due  to differences  in  the  requisitioned  quantity  and  the  quantity  identified  for  procurement.    The IMS  must  take  the  time  to  ensure  that  appropriate  Stock  Control  System  D035A  action  is taken to split requisitions, as required.  At the time of contract award, the IMS will change the  ASI  Contract  Field  No.  from  “013H”  to  “013X”  and  update  the  ESD.    It  is  imperative that  the  Stock  Control  System  D035A  status  be  accurate  and  accomplished  in  a  timely manner, as this information is critical in the reporting status utilized by ERS, the MAJCOMs, and  404  SCMS  for  tracking.    It  must  be  noted  that  “locking  in”  a  requisition  on  BV  status with  013H  ensures  the  requisition  cannot  be  cancelled  without  the  IMS’s  knowledge;  and ensures the requisition is not satisfied through other means without the IMS’s knowledge and intent to do so.  Updating the ESD is also imperative as the MAJCOM relies on this data to estimate when they will receive the asset: 17.8.1.1.  (013 = FY13)  . 17.8.1.2.  “H” = PR/MIPR Complete. 17.8.1.3.  “X” = Contract Awarded. Note:  If a cancellation request is received, the IMS must do all that is possible to honor the request, including rerouting the assets or reducing the procurement.  It is most important that we do not spend our limited funding on assets that are not needed.  However, contracts will not be terminated or reduced due to the cancelation of requirement by a MAJCOM if other requirements within the same PEC exist for that Sub-Group Master NSN. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   113 Note:  All requisitions coded BV drop off the UFR.  Therefore, it is imperative the item manager BV requisitions that match the quantity on the Buy List, otherwise a valid unfunded requirements will not be reflected on the UFR and the item manager will not get the opportunity to flex these to the Buy List (See Paragraph 17.6). 17.8.2.  At times, MAJCOMs will issue unique funding to the PMs, such as NGREA, BP13, etc.    The  MAJCOMs  need  visibility  of  the  requisitions  associated  with  their  unique  funds.  As such, they sometimes request that the item managers use unique ASI codes to designate the funding issued by the MAJCOM or the D200C RCOs may assign a specific ASI number to identify the special funding of the requisition. 17.9.  Buy List Changes. 17.9.1.  D200C  RCOs,  working  with  their  IMS,  will  be  responsible  for  identifying  all changes to the O&M Buy List.  Deletions to the Buy Lists will be made through the Buy List screen  in  ERS.    In  additions  to  the  Buy  Lists,  changes  will  be  made  through  the  “Current Unfunded Priority List” screen.  It is the responsibility of the IMS to identify any items that cannot  be  procured  to  their  D200C  RCOs  immediately  upon  gaining  this  knowledge.    The D200C RCOs will make the final assessment before any requirement is added/deleted from the Buy List. 17.9.2.  The IMS will identify changes to D200C RCO, who will make the change in ERS. 17.9.3.  The D200C RCOs and IMS will ensure they annotate the correct reason for deleting or adding requirements in ERS. 17.10.  Funding. 17.10.1.  DAF  O&M  Support  Equipment.    All  DAF  Support  Equipment  funding  will  be issued  from  SAF/FM  to  the  HQ  CAM  office.    The  404  SCMS  will  provide  distribution instructions based on the Buy List.  (T-1)  Funds will be loaded in the General Accounting Financial System-Base Level (GAFS-BL/BQ) financial system by the CAM office based on instructions from the 404 SCMS.  FM organizations will advise their executing divisions of their  PE  allocations,  as  well  as  the  applicable  funds  cites.    RCCCs  will  not  be  established below  division  level.    The  allocations  will  initially  be  based  upon  the  Buy  List,  but  could change if a Center or Group requires additional funding or has excess funding.  Funds will be issued and managed by PE. 17.10.1.1.  Each  division  is  responsible  for  executing  100%  of  the  funds  allocated  to them.  If required, it will be accomplished by flexing unfunded requirements to the Buy List.    If  a  division  is  unable  to  fully  execute  their  allocation,  the  D200C  RCO  will immediately notify the applicable FM organization, who will notify 404 SCMS to realign funds through the CAM office.  Excess funds will be identified immediately. 17.10.1.2.  The IMS, with aid from PM(s), will be required to provide Budget Authority (BA) requirements by month to 404 SCMS by mid Aug to support the Buy List.  These requirements  will  be  provided  to  SAF/FM  and  will  be  the  basis  for  receipt  of  monthly DAF BA for each Complex. 17.10.1.3.  IMS, with the aid of PMs, will be required to provide estimated award dates, by  month,  to  support  the  Buy  List  by  mid  Aug.    These  forecasts  will  be  provided  to SAF/FM  and  used  as  the  execution  metric  for  O&M  support  equipment  funding;  the   114 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 dates provided in August cannot be changed.  Executing divisions will be responsible for reporting on variances. 17.10.2.  AFRC/NGB.  AFRC and NGB will issue an operating budget authority/accounting document to the executing Centers based on their Buy List requirements.  Executing Centers will  assess  executability  and  provide  estimated  award  dates  in  the  same  manner  as  DAF requirements. 17.11.  Execution Status. 17.11.1.  The  following  information  will  be  maintained  in  ERS  by  the  Financial  Managers using the Maintain Execution Status screen.  This data will be used by the MAJCOMs POCs on status of funds and funded requirements. 17.11.2.  PR/MIPR  Number,  Secondary  Document  Number,  PR  Prep  Date  (i.e.,  Submitted Date),  PR  quantity,  PR  Amount,  Contract  Cost,  Estimated  Award  Date,  and  Contract Number. 17.12.  Non-Recurring Costs (NRC). 17.12.1.  IMS will continue to input anticipated NRC in ERS procurement information screen as soon as they are known.  They will not be included in the current year Buy List until the IMS has determined the requirement is ready to execute and there is an immediate need for funds on the PR or contract. 17.12.1.1.  When the IMS is ready to  submit the PR/MIPR package with  the NRC fund cite included, the IMS will first ensure ERS reflects the requirement.  If it does not, the IMS must input the new NRC requirement in ERS.  The D200C RCO should work with their  FM  POC  to  determine  the  appropriate  PE  to  assign  to  the  requirement  and select/assign the PE in ERS. 17.12.1.2.  The  PE  must  be  based  on  the  PE  that  has  the  preponderance  of  NET requirements.    AFRC  and  NGB  PEs  may  be  used  only  with  prior  written  coordination from the AFRC and NGB ERS POC. 17.12.1.3.  When  the  PE  has  been  selected  in  ERS  for  the  NRC  requirement,  ERS  will reflect  the  NRC  requirement  on  the  Current  Unfunded  Priority  List  following  the  next nightly prioritization.  The D200C RCO will then flex the NRC requirement to the Buy List using “Current Unfunded Priority List” screen in ERS. 17.12.2.  NRC  only  includes  costs  that  cannot  be  associated  with  the  hardware  being procured,  such  as  technical  data,  testing  and  evaluation,  software,  etc.    The  NRC  estimate will not include the unit cost of the item.  This will allow visibility of NRC costs for future budgeting. 17.13.  Surge Requirements. 17.13.1.  IMS will validate all surge requirements by contacting the applicable CEMO office.  Upon  validation,  the  requirement  will  be  flexed  to  the  Buy  List.  However,  note  that additional funding will not be provided for the surge requirement; funding already provided must be used, which could mean lower priority requirements will not be procured. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   115 17.13.2.  Surge  Requirements  for  DAF  MAJCOMS.    If  the  PM  receiving  the  surge requirement  has  obligated  all  of  its  DAF  funds,  the  D200C  RCO  will  notify  the  FM  OPR, who will notify 404 SCMS to realign funding. 17.13.3.  Surge Requirements for AFRC or NGB.  If the PM receiving the surge requirement has obligated all of the AFRC or NGB funds, whichever applies to the surge requirement, the D200C RCO will notify the FM OPR.  The FM OPR will notify the appropriate command, AFRC or NGB, for additional funding or guidance. 17.14.  Validating a Surge Requirement. 17.14.1.  An  increase  in  authorizations  is  NOT  justification  for  use  of  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff (JCS) Project Code (JCS PC). 17.14.2.  If  equipment  items  are  required  to  support  the  need  for  additional  or  expanded capability to support a JCS operation, JCS PC may be used for those requirements which will directly support the additional/expanded requirement. 17.14.3.  If units are actively deployed to a JCS contingency or have a firm tasking order to a JCS  contingency  location,  a  JCS  PC  may  be  applied  to  mission  essential  equipment requisitions as follows: 17.14.3.1.  If authorization is one and the unit is zero balance, a JCS PC may be applied to the requisition. 17.14.3.2.  If  the  authorization  is  greater  than  one,  a  JCS  PC  may  only  be  applied  to requisitions  that  will  bring  the  unit  above  zero balance.    If  the  authorization  is  two  and the on-hand balance is one, the JCS PC may not be applied. 17.14.3.3.  Individual  Equipment.    The  JCS  project  code  will  be  used  for  individual equipment  items  only  when  the  items  are  mission  essential  for  operations  or  force protection. 17.15.  First Destination Transportation. 17.15.1.  First  Destination  Transportation  (Freight  on  Board  (FOB)  origin)  for  support equipment  is  funded  with  EEIC  638  Support  Equipment  funding  which  is  committed  and obligated  on  a  Transportation  Miscellaneous  Obligation  Reimbursement  Document  by  FM.  FOB destination charges are included in the unit price of the equipment. 17.16.  AF Metrology and Calibration (AFMETCAL) Requirements. 17.16.1.  AFMETCAL  requirements  are  published  in  the  AF  Metrology  Brochure  and negotiated between the AFMETCAL office and the MAJCOM OPRs.  The CAM office will distribute  funding  to  AFMETCAL  based  upon  current  funding  levels  and  approved requirements.  These requirements are not in ERS. 17.17.  Pallets and Nets. 17.17.1.  The  Support  Equipment  PM  consolidates  pallets  and  nets  requirements  for  DoD.  The CAM office will distribute funding for pallets and nets based upon current funding levels and approved requirements.  These requirements are not in ERS. 17.18.  Tanks, Racks, Adapters and Pylons (TRAP).   116 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 (non-WRM)  TRAP 17.18.1.  Operational requirements  will  be  provided  by  HQ AFMC/A4MW.    WRM  TRAP  requirements  will  be  provided  by  the War  Reserve  Materiel (WRM) Global Management Office (635 SCOW).  The CAM office will distribute funding for  TRAP  based  upon  current  funding  levels  and  approved  requirements.    These requirements are not in ERS. 17.19.  POM Process. 17.19.1.  The POM Process for O&M Support Equipment purchases (EEIC 638) is a separate process  from  the  CAM  WSS  POM  Process  and  these  requirements  are  not  captured  in CAFDEx™.    The  WSS  POM  data  for  O&M  Support  Equipment  purchases  (EEIC  638)  is consolidated  by  the  404  SCMS/GULA  with  input  from  the  Support  Equipment  PM, Automatic  Test  Equipment  PM,  AFMETCAL  Program  Office,  TRAP  Program  Office  and data  from  the  Logistics,  Installations  &  Mission  Support-Enterprise  View  System  (LIMS-EV).    The  POM  data  is  submitted  directly  to  Air  Staff  with  a  copy  provided  to  the  CAM office.    Note:   The  O&M  support  equipment  purchases  (EEIC  638)  requirements  are managed in ERS. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   117 Chapter 18 RESERVED FOR WSS RISK BASED ASSESSMENT PROCESS   118 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 19 ORGANIC WORKLOAD 19.1.  Overview. 19.1.1.  HQ AFMC/A4F CAM provides the DPEM WSS workload for all Funds Holders for the  upcoming  execution  year  plus  two  years  to  support  the  ALC  in  determining  organic workload.  An Initial Workload Data Call is created in CAFDEx™ FRM, which is a copy of the  Total  Force  POM  Data  Call  for all  Funds  Holders.    All  Funds  Holders  will  review  and update  the  Initial  Workload  Data  Call  as  required.    The  updated  Initial  Data  Call  will  be provided  to  AFLCMC/LG,  AFSC/LG,  and  HQ  AFMC/A4F  NLT  2nd  week  of  March.    TheInitial  Data  Call  is  reviewed  by  AFLCMC  and  feedback  provided  back  to  HQ  AFMC/A4F for  adjustments  as  deemed  required.    Approved  changes  are  captured  in  a  new  Baseline Workload Data Call and provided to AFLCMC/LG, AFSC/LG, and HQ AFMC/A4F NLT 31 March; this data call will be used to plan WSS funded customer orders and workload for all Funds Holders. 19.2.  Baseline Workload Data Call changes. 19.2.1.  Any  changes  to  the  Baseline  Workload  Data  Call  will  be  accomplished  through revisions.  There are two known events that may drive a revision; they are the Execution Plan Data Call with updated SAF/FM funding bogey around mid-year, and PBR funding bogey in the  fall.    The  new  Baseline  Workload  Data  Call  with  revisions  will  be  provided  to AFLCMC/LG, AFSC/LG and HQ AFMC/A4F. AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   119 Chapter 20 WSS PLANNING, PROGRAMMING, BUDGETING AND EXECUTION PROCESS 20.1.  Overview. 20.1.1.  The purpose of the PPBE (Ref. AFI 65-601, Vol. 3) is to link mission requirements to  financial  resources.    The  result  of  this  linkage  is  that  resources  can  be  allocated  in  a systematic way with direct relationship to the roles and missions of the AF and Department of Defense.  The process also provides the information AF senior leaders need to balance all the Service’s fiscal needs five to six years into the future to accomplish long term planning and  secure  funding.    The  PB  ultimately  results  in  funding  authorized  and  appropriated  by Congress to the AF for the execution year and sets the rates for the AFWCF. 20.2.  The  Planning  phase  is  accomplished  through  the  LRDP  which  is  explained  in Chapter 1.  6. 20.3.  The Programming phase is accomplished with the POM Process which is covered in Chapter 21. 20.4.  The  Budgeting  phase  is  the  WSS  Execution  Plan  Development  Process  which  is covered in Chapter 22. 20.5.  The Execution phase is the WSS Execution Process covered in Chapter 23.   120 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 21 RESERVED FOR WSS PROGRAM OBJECTIVE MEMORANDUM (POM) DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   121 RESERVED FOR WSS EXECUTION PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS Chapter 22   122 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 23 WSS EXECUTION PROCESS 23.1.  Requirement Changes. 23.1.1.  Requirement changes at the PCN/Task level must be documented in the CAFDEx™ FRM module with an approved OOC.  This includes both increases and decreases.  The OOC process is documented in Chapter 14. 23.1.2.  The Program Office is responsible to ensure the requirement has been loaded into the CAFDEx™ FRM. 23.1.3.  The Program Office is also responsible to update any current year requirements that were bought down with prior year funds to show the requirement decrease.  Follow the OOC process documented in Chapter 14. 23.2.  Funding Changes. 23.2.1.  For  AFMC  funds  holder  requirements  the  Program  Office  will  update  all  funding realignments,  additional  funding  requests,  and  identification  of  excess  funding  in  the CAFDEx™ FRM module at the PCN/Task level on a quarterly basis.  For other funds holder requirements the process will be in accordance with the individual funds holder procedures. 23.3.  Obligations. 23.3.1.  Program  Office  will  update  actual  and  estimated  quarterly  obligations  in  the CAFDEx™  FRM  module  at  the  PCN/Task  level.    The  FRM  is  not  an  official  accounting system  however  it  is  important  that  actual  and  estimated  quarterly  obligations  are  updated.  This  update  provides  a  current  funding  picture  that  can  be  viewed  by  higher  HQ’s, MAJCOMs and Funds Holders to assist them with funding drills, as well as provide needed “time-critical” information on funding levels for various platform reviews across the AF. 23.3.2.  Obligations  must  be  updated  within  the  CAFDEx™  FRM  module  no  later  than  5 business days after the end of each quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul and Oct) to include re-spreading any unobligated projection to the remaining quarters of the fiscal year. 23.3.3.  Funds  Holders  will  validate  the  FRM  obligations  to  the  AF  official  accounting system Commander’s Resource Integration System (CRIS). 23.3.4.  Along with the quarterly obligations documentation, the Program Office will update quarterly  the  Induction/Completion/Deferred  (ICD)  tab  all  DPEM  PCN  quantity-driven requirements  and  all  quantity-driven  CLS  PCN/Tasks  in  the  CAFDEx™  FRM  Grid Execution  Section.    Program  Office  will  populate  the  inductions,  completions,  and  any deferrals for all years open on the ICD tab, which includes previous, current and future fiscal years. William A.

Major Command (MAJCOM)—A major subdivision of the Air Force that is assigned a major part  of  the  Air  Force  mission.    A  MAJCOM  is  directly  subordinate  to  Headquarters  US  Air Force.    Most  MAJCOMs  have  the  word  Command  as  part  of  their  designation;  MAJCOM AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015   139 headquarters are management headquarters and thus have the full range of functional staff. (AFI 38-101). Maintenance Group—In the United States Air Force, a wing is normally the organizational tier below a Numbered Air Force. USAF wings structured to fulfill a mission from a specific base, and contain a headquarters and four groups: an operations group, a maintenance group, a medical group  and  a  mission  support  group.    Maintenance  Groups  as  the  name  indicates  supports  all maintenance operations. Mission  Design  Series—The System by  which  military  aerospace vehicles are identified.

Out Year—Any year beyond the budget year for which projections of spending are made. PPBE  (Planning,  Programming,  Budgeting,  and  Execution)—The  PPBE  (Ref.  AFI  65-601, Vol 3) consists of two major programming and budgeting exercises, the PBR and the PB.  It is a continuous cycle with the PPBE segments in any given year overlapping segments of a number of other years. Programming links mission requirements to the financial resources required.  The result  of  this  linkage  is  that  resources  can  be  allocated  in  a  systematic  way  with  direct relationship to the roles and missions of the AF and Department of Defense (DoD or DD when referring to forms).  The process also provides the information AF senior leaders need to balance all  the  Service’s  fiscal  needs.    The  WERR  process  is  linked  to  the  PPBE  via  the  HQ  AFMC LRDP, which provides the depot level WERR input to the POM to ensure the proper funding and resources be available to overhaul AF engines. Requirements are first identified in the POM, the first phase of the PPBE.  It is the place to bring forward all requirements to be funded across the FYDP  so  the  AF  can  identify  funds  needed  to  accomplish  the  work.    The  POM  forecasts  AF requirements  five  to  six  years  into  the  future  to  accomplish  long  term  planning  and  secure funding.    The  PB  ultimately  results  in  funding  authorized  and  appropriated  by  Congress  to  the AF for the execution year and sets the rates for the AFWCF. Prepare  Requirements—Identify  new  emerging requirements. requirements  and  validate  existing Prioritization—Sorting  of  requirements  according  to  their  relative  importance  by  weapon system, applicable end-items, commodity, and/or by common process. Prioritized—Requirements sorted according to their relative importance using approved criteria and methodology.

The first  character  identifies  the  customer  of  the  Maintenance  Division.    The  second  character provides  the  RGC,  and  the  third  character  represents  the  managing  ALC  for  customer  orders. The  last  three  characters  are  assigned  by  the  ALC  MP&E  OPR  for  local  identification  and control of a specific order.  The last four characters of the PCN are also referred to as the Pseudo Code. Program  Executive  Officer—The  individual  dedicated  to  executive  management  and supervision  of  a  portfolio  of  mission-related  ACAT  and  selected  programs.    The  PEO  is accountable to the Service Acquisition Executive. Program Group—A CAM unique term that’s used extensively throughout the WSS process.  In most cases the program group is synonymous with a weapon system Program Office.  All WSS requirements  are  grouped  into  specific  program  groups  with  each  having  a  PM,  typically  a  0-6/GS-15 who validates and publishes those requirements annually. Program  Manager—The  DoDD  5000.01  designated  individual  with  responsibility  for  and authority  to  accomplish  program  objectives  for  development,  production,  and  sustainment  to meet  the  user’s  operational  needs.    The  PM  for  programs  are  accountable  for  credible  cost, schedule, performance, and materiel readiness.  ACAT I and ACAT II PMs are approved by the SAE and the PEO.  Delegated ACAT II and III PMs are approved by the PEO. Programmed  Depot  Maintenance  (PDM)—Depot  modification  and  maintenance  of  all scheduled depot requirements accomplished normally on a calendar time cycle.

Properly  Documented—All  required  data  fields  are  populated  and  file  maintained  in  the Centralized Access for Data Exchange database. PRS  (Propulsion  Requirements  Systems)—PRS  (i.e.,  D087Q)  is  the  AF  standard  system,  as detailed in AFI 20-115, for the computation of spare whole engine requirements.  There are two main types of PRS computations:  the acquisition computation and the distribution computation; 1. Acquisition  Computation.    The  acquisition  computation  process  determines  the  number  ofspare  whole  engines  required  in  support  of  each  aircraft  MDS  /  engine  Type,  Model,  Series (TMS). 2. Distribution Computation.  The distribution computation determines spare whole engineoperational requirements for using MAJCOMs and ALCs. The computation is an annual process and is one of several key events feeding the WERR process.  The following input data is required to accomplish a computation: Peacetime Flying  Hours  and  Basing—Obtained from the USAF Flying Hour Programa.Authorization (PA) Document.   142 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Wartime  Flying  Hours  and  Basing—Obtained  from  the  Requirements  Daily  Answerb.Tape (RDAT).

Quality  Control-1  (QC-1)  Review—A  review  used  to  provide  an  assessment  of  the  state  of published  requirements  as  documented  within  CAFDEx™.    This  review  is  performed  by  the CAM office, but all stakeholders are encouraged to participate. Quality  Control-2  (QC-2)  Review—This  will  address  special  interest  areas  with  increased oversight. Quality Deficiency Report (QDR) Investigations—This paragraph also applies to PQDRs, tear down  deficiency  reports,  and  material  deficiency  reports  (MDRs).    AFMCI  21  130,  Paragraph 1.17.3  says  in  part  “PQDR  analysis  and  report  preparation  (investigation)  is  always  funded  by the  prime  ALC  regardless  of  the  ultimate  findings.”    It  does  not,  however,  specify  which Customer is responsible.  That depends on the asset.  If it is an item that is procured and repaired by CSAG-S, they fund the investigation.  If it is  anything  else (e.g., a whole engine) customer funds  the  investigation.    Note  that  this  responsibility  is  limited  to  investigations  only.    Any repairs are funded by the Customer who would normally fund them. Quality  of  Requirements—Measures  if  the  requirements  are  accurately  captured,  rigorously supported, and properly documented. Ratable—A  small  replaceable  component  for  an  aircraft  that  requires  replacement  at  certain intervals, or after a particular amount of wear, or use.

All expenditures, including line support manufacture and routed work, are controlled by  specific  aircraft  serial  number  once  the  aircraft  is  input  to  work.    Damage  repair, accomplished  or  actual,  is  in  RGC  A,  unless  accomplished  by  field  team;  then  it  should  be  in RGC B.  Fixed facility aircraft mod kit proofing is also in RGC A.  Organic work-loaded RGC A customer  orders  are  charged  to  type  1  project  orders.    Costs  to  the  Customer  are  based  on  an organic  unit  sales  price  composed  of  a  given  hourly  rate  times  the  number  of  hours  or  a contract/interservice  unit  sales  price  based  on  the  unit  repair  cost.    Workload  must  be accomplished  with  the  CSAG-M  organically,  contractually,  or  by  interservice.    The  EEIC  for aircraft Programmed workload is 541. RGC  B—Aircraft  un-programmed  maintenance.    This  includes  field  team  work  and  un-programmed aircraft workloads not in RGC A.  Also it includes workloads for which a specific input/output has not been formalized and planned organic reclamation of complete aircraft.  All damage  repair  accomplished  by  depot  field  teams  is  in  RGC  B.    Input/output  schedules  are required.    Once  a  workload  is  input  in  the  RGC  B  it  remains  there  through  completion.  Requirements  use  workload  projections  by  MD.    When  the  specific  end  item  is  identified,  the requirement  is  expressed  by  MDS.    The  Product  Division  buyer  enters  all  requirement information in the MP&E system.  Organic work-loaded RGC B customer orders are charged to type 6 project orders.  Workload must be accomplished within the CSAG-M either organically, contractually or by interservice.  The EEIC for aircraft is 541. RGC C—Missile programmed maintenance.  This includes all programmed missile depot-level maintenance requirements for which a specific input/output schedule is developed.  The Product Division buyer enters requirement information by MDS in the MP&E system.  If accomplished organically as Cost Class 1, all expenditures including line item support manufacture and routed work are controlled by specific missile serial number once the missile is input to work.  Costs to the Customer are based on a unit sales price composed of a fixed hourly rate times the number of hours or a contract/interservice unit sales price based on the unit repair cost.  All organic work-loaded  as  RGC  C  customer  orders  are  charged  to  type  2  project  orders.    Workload  must  be accomplished  within  the  CSAG-M  either  organically,  contractually,  or  interservice.    The  EEIC for missiles is 542.   144 AFMAN 63-143  12 AUGUST 2015 Rigorously  Supported—Requirement  is  justified  in  terms  of  engineering,  statistical  or  other analyses  to  show  its  need  and  the  impact  if  not  accomplished  in  measurable  terms  of  safety, readiness, mandate, and/or sustainability.
