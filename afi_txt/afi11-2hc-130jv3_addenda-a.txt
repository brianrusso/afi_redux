Those  who  use  this  instruction  should  bear  in  mind  that  an  infinite  number  of variations  are  available  and  that  the  cargo  compartment  configurations  listed  here  are  the  most typical encountered day to day. If deviations are necessary, use sound judgment and operational risk management to meet mission demands. This instruction establishes basic cargo compartment configuration, standard equipment, and equipment locations aboard HC-130J aircraft. Some HC-130J  aircraft  have  additional  equipment  installed  that  may  affect  configuring  the  aircraft  as listed.  For operational planning purposes, each configuration has an average time annotated and number of personnel to configure the airplane.  The times quoted are approximate figures and are configuration  times  only.    They  do  not  include  de-configuration  times.    For  example, reconfiguring from a P-1 configuration, 84 sidewall and center aisle seats to a C-1 configuration (clean  floor)  requires  more  than  one-half  hour  for  one  person,  which  is  the  time  allocated  to configure a C-1 configuration. 1.2.  Responsibility.  Operational plans consider the most appropriate configuration that satisfies mission requirements and permits the minimum amount of variations and man-hours to change.  USAF  units  performing  services  on  HC-130J  aircraft  (i.e.,  Maintenance,  Aerial  Port,  and Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE) will configure the aircraft IAW this instruction and as outlined in  mission  directives,  to  include  equipment  stowage/installation  IAW  the  configuration  and equipment  tables.  (T-2).  AFE personnel  will ensure all life sustaining equipment  is  positioned on the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW Table 1.1. (T-2).  Maintenance personnel will ensure all required and standard and mission specific equipment is positioned aboard the aircraft to meet mission requirements IAW Tables 2.1 and  2.2. (T-2).  Some equipment listed in Table 2.2  is  roll  on/roll  off  equipment  controlled  by  unit  designated  personnel.    Before  home  station departure,  maintenance  personnel  will  configure  the  aircraft  (including  modifications)  to  meet mission  requirements  IAW  Figures  3.1  thru    3.56.3.  (T-2).    For  the  CP-2  through  CP-5 configurations,  the  sidewall  seats  are  stowed  to  facilitate  preflight  of  the  Enhanced  Cargo Handling System (ECHS) rails and then lowered by aircrew with maintenance assistance.  After departure  from  home  station,  the  aircrew  will  accomplish  all  configurations  with  assistance  by maintenance/aerial  port  personnel  if  available.  (T-2).    During  preflight,  aircrew  will  ensure required mission equipment has been provided and is properly installed. (T-2).  When the aircraft configuration is not completed prior to aircrew show time, the loadmaster (LM) will assist in the completion of the configuration, after accomplishing required pre-departure duties (i.e., preflight, loading, etc.). (T-2).  LMs have overall responsibility for configuration management and proper installation of equipment on the aircraft. 1.3.  Standard Configuration Codes.  Units will use the following codes when referring to HC-130J cargo compartment configurations. (T-2). 1.3.1.  AE - Aeromedical Evacuation 1.3.2.  C - Cargo 1.3.3.  CP - Cargo and Passengers 1.3.4.  LP - PSYOPS AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A  9 JUNE 2017 7 1.3.5.  P - Passengers 1.3.6.  RAPID – Infil/Exfil Equipment or Personnel 1.3.7.  TAC - Tactical Airdrop Cargo 1.3.8.  TAP - Tactical Airdrop Paratroop 1.3.9.  RSQ – Rescue Configuration 1.4.  Modifications.  Configuration  codes  of  this  instruction  may  require  modifications  for  a specific mission.  Each modification needs to be carefully evaluated prior to mission operation to ensure  maximum  flight  safety  and  aircraft  equipment  compatibility.    Units  will  ensure  each mission  directive  identifies  basic  configuration  codes  and  modifications  to  satisfy  mission requirements.  (T-2).  For  example,  an  aeromedical  evacuation  mission  may  require  more  litters than  available  in  configuration  AE-1.    Consult  appropriate  configuration  charts  to  determine where the desired additional litters can be installed and which seats are removed.  Indicate in the mission  directive,  by  position  (left  or  right,  and  number)  which  seats  are  deleted  and  (by alphabetical  position)  litter  tier  provisions  are  installed.    Example:  Configuration  AE-1(Mod), remove seats 12, 13, 14, and 15 left and right, install litter tier provisions C and D. 1.5.  Weight and Balance. 1.5.1.  Configuration  equipment  and  necessary  supply  changes  affect  aircraft  weight  and balance.  Maintenance  units  ensure  the  designated  items  shown  in  Table  2.1  are  on  the aircraft and the LMs verify proper location, quantity, and serviceability to be included in the aircraft basic weight and remain on the aircraft except for maintenance, inspection, and when directed  by  this  AFI.    (T-2).    Maintenance  Units  will  ensure  proper  equipment  types, quantities and locations added to the aircraft and LMs verify and/or request appropriately the equipment listed in Tables 1.1, 2.1, and 2.2. (T-2).  The LM will enter the weight contained in  the  required  equipment  table  for  the  applicable  configuration  in  the  CNI-MU  and  when preparing  the  DD  Form  365-4.    (T-2).  Adjustments  are  made  when  the  actual  on  board weight of these items vary from the data shown.  LMs will adjust the weight and moments of the aircraft armor (Table 4.8) on the DD Form 365-4 if the armor is installed on the aircraft other  than  its  designated  location  (T-2),  i.e.,  paratroop  door  armor  moments  need  to  be  re-calculated when the armor is removed and stored elsewhere for paratroop door access.  LMs will complete the DD Form 365-4 IAW instructions in Chapter 5 of this instruction. (T-2). 1.5.2.  When a configuration change that removes items listed in  Table 2.1 is accomplished at a Forward Operating Location (FOL) and no Quality Assurance Branch (QA) weight and balance authority is deployed to the location, maintenance personnel will put an info note in the AFTO Form 781A, Maintenance Discrepancy and Work Document indicating the weight, fuselage station and moment of any equipment added or removed. (T-2).  The LM will add or subtract  the  listed  weight  and  moment  from  the  last  entry  in  the  DD  Form  365-3,  Chart  C. (T-2).  Annotate the new weight and moment in Block 1 of DD 365-4, Weight and Balance Clearance  Form  F.  Configuration  changes  accomplished  at  home  station  require  a  QA update to the DD Form 365-3, Chart C.  EXCEPTION: Minor equipment changes after crew show may be annotated on the DD Form 365-4, by the LM. 1.6.  Revisions.  All  revisions  consist  of  electronic  interim  change  (IC)  or  new  publication. Personnel at all echelons are encouraged to make recommendations to improve this instruction. 8 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A  9 JUNE 2017 Direct  proposed  changes  to  ACC/A3J  in  accordance  with  AFI  11-202  Vol.  2,  Aircrew Standardization/Evaluation Program, and AFI 11-215, USAF Flight Manual Program. 1.7.  Supplements.  Subordinate  unit  supplements  to  this  instruction  that  change  the  basic policies,  procedures,  or  formats  prescribed  herein  are  prohibited.  EXCEPTION:  Groups  may supplement  Table  2.2  with  additional  items.  They  may  also  supplement  Chapter  3  with specified  configuration  modifications  (MOD)  to  accommodate  theater  unique  requirements  or standard home station training configurations. listed (T-2). in  Table  1.1. 1.8.  Aircrew  Life  Sustaining  Equipment  Configuration  .    HC-130J  aircraft  are  configured with  standard  quantities  of  aircrew  life  sustaining  equipment  (ALSE)  IAW  this  instruction.  Units  will  configure  aircraft  as   During  aircraft contingency/deployment  generations,  it  is  imperative  that  aircraft  deploy  with  the  full complement  of  ALSE.    Units  must  ensure  this  equipment  is  at  forward  operating  locations  to allow  maximum  mission  flexibility  when  aircraft  are  away  from  home  station.  (T-2).    In  the event  installed  ALSE  inspection  dates  expire  while  the  aircraft  is  on  alert  status  or  away  from operating  location,  place  these  items  in  the  AFTO  Form  781A  on  a  red  dash  symbol  until  the aircraft  goes  off  alert  or  returns  to  operating  location.    When  aircraft  is  released  from  alert  or returns  to  operating  location,  upgrade  the  symbol  to  a  red  X  IAW  T.O.  00-20-1  Aerospace Equipment Maintenance Inspection, Documentation, Policies, and Procedures. 1.8.1.  Aircraft  Transfer  Requirements.    When  transferring  aircraft,  position  ALSE  IAW permanent  transfer  configuration.    The  losing  unit  will  contact  the  gaining  organization’s AFE section and initiate transfer of required aircraft-installed ALSE and inspection records. (T-2).   The gaining organization will conduct an acceptance inspection and forward a copy of  discrepancies,  to  include  any  equipment  shortages,  to  their  respective  MAJCOM  IAW T.O. 00-20-1. (T-2).  Without documented coordination and approval, do not transfer aircraft with less than the required equipment.  The losing organization must make up any shortages from  on-hand  assets  to  ensure  transferring  aircraft  has  required  equipment.  (T-2).    Note:  Transfers of aircraft from the Air Reserve Component to the Regular Air Force must comply with  DoDI  1225.06,  Equipping  the  Reserve  Forces,  and  AFI  16-402,  Aerospace  Vehicle Programming, Assignment, Distribution, Accounting, and Termination. 1.8.2.  ALSE  Stowage  Bins.    Handle  ALSE  with  care  to  avoid  damage  to  the  equipment.  ALSE  is  always  placed  in  the  stowage  bins,  unless  stowed  elsewhere  for  aircraft  CG limitations.    The  primary  purpose  of  all  life  support  stowage  bins  is  for  ALSE.  Aircrew/maintenance will not place oil, hydraulic fluid or other liquids in the stowage bins. (T-2). 1.8.3.  The  unit  or  service  being  airdropped  will  furnish  the  required  number  of  life preservers  for  airdrop  of  personnel  over  or  near  bodies  of  water.  (T-2).

General.  This chapter contains basic cargo compartment configuration in floor plan format and weight, location, and moment data for associated required equipment. 3.2.  Configuration  .  Although basic configuration modifications are authorized to meet special requirements, the following factors require consideration: 3.2.1.  Single  sidewall  seats  cannot  be  used  unless  connected  to  a  double  sidewall  seat (except for specific configurations.) 3.2.2.  Passengers/ambulatory  patients  may  not  be  seated  closer  than  30  inches  in  front  of palletized, netted cargo or cargo secure with straps.  This does not apply to cargo restrained by chains/chain  bridle assemblies.  When palletized or non-palletized cargo is secured with aircraft  tie  down  chains,  the  30-inch  spacing  is  not  required.    EXCEPTION:    Always maintain the 30-inch spacing on AE missions, when carrying litters. 3.2.2.1.  Parachutes are carried IAW Table 1.1.  When passengers/troops are carried with parachutes on board aircraft without ALSE bins, up to four seats will not be available in the cargo compartment. (T-3). 3.2.3.  The loadmaster will ensure the normal spacing for paratroopers is 24 inches and adjust the spacing as mission dictates. (T-3).  Aircraft without accommodations for 24-inch spacing may be configured in 20-inch spacing. 3.2.4.  Cargo  height  in  pallet  position  two  may  be  restricted  if  overhead  equipment  rack(s) protrude  into  the  cargo  area.    The  loadmaster  will  ensure  this  restriction  is  76  inches  and begins  at  the inboard side of the cargo handling  system rails and extend inboard 12 inches. (T-3).  This restriction could be on either or both sides of the aircraft. 3.2.5.  For  flight,  the  aircraft  ramp’s  cargo  weight  limit  is  5,000  pounds  of  floor  loaded  or palletized cargo in pallet position six, to include the weight of pallet and nets.  See T.O. 1C-130(H)J-9 for other restrictions. 3.2.6.  Changes  in  configuration  may  affect  the  overall  aircraft  center  of  gravity  (CG).  NOTE:    The  addition  of  aircraft  defensive  systems,  Kevlar,  and  other  modifications  can produce a center of gravity requiring counter adjustments of the load center of balance within T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1 limits.  Weight for this equipment is in Table 4.8 and  4.9. 3.2.7.  This chapter’s drawings are not drawn precisely to scale with respect to actual aircraft locations.  Clear space depicted forward of the first center aisle seat and aft of the last center aisle seat  on TAP-1  configuration is  unusable.   NOTE: Center aisle seats  begin at  the first seat stanchion point FS 262 3.2.8.  A 20-inch clear area is mandatory on the forward right side of a ramp pallet to allow access to aft latrine facilities.  A safety aisle is required in pallet positions three, four, and six.  (Para 4.2.3, Figure 4.1) 3.2.9.  Trashcans, other than integral containers, cannot be carried. 18 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A  9 JUNE 2017 3.2.10.  The  loadmaster  will  stow  seats  1  and  2,  left  side  to  allow  unrestricted  flight deck/crew  entrance  door  access  when  the  seats  are  not  needed  to  accomplish  a  specific mission. (T-3). 3.2.11.  Configurations’ seat totals include seats designated for LMs. 3.2.12.  ECHS lock/seat stanchion locations is provided in Table 4.10. 3.2.13.  Aeromedical  evacuation  (AE)  configurations.    Medical  Crew  Directors  (MCD)  and Charge  Medical  Technician  (CMT)  will  determine  final  litter  equipment  configuration  and aeromedical  evacuation  crewmember  (AECM)  seating.  (T-2).    AECM  seat  locations  may vary  based  on  patient/cabin  observation  requirements.    Overhead  equipment  racks,  missile defense  system  modifications,  and  secure  voice  communications  system  decrease  litter capacity  in  litter  tiers  adjacent  to  their  installation.    Up  to  six  seats  are  mandatory  for AECM’s/LM(s) depending on crew complement.  Seats are numbered for identification from front  to  rear and are referred to  as seat  1-left,  or seat  1-right,  etc.   Litter tiers are identified alphabetically  and  litter  spaces  identified  numerically  from  lowest  (1)  to  highest  (5).    On litter tier configuration illustrations, the number in parentheses indicates total litters per tier.  NOTE:  LMs  may use swiss-seats/restraint devices on AE/MEDEVAC missions as mission requirements/litter positions dictate, however a designated seat is available if an emergency situation arises. The LM will stow the roller conveyers where litters and seats are rigged. (T-3).    AE  equipment,  which  may  be  secured  in  unused  seats  if  floor  space  is  limited,  may reduce seat availability.  Portable therapeutic liquid oxygen (PTLOX) is stowed in a location to prevent contact with fuels or hydraulic fluids.    NOTE: The LM will ensure five portable oxygen bottles/PBEs are available for AE personnel on AE configurations. (T-3). 3.2.14.  Aircraft  Commander  will  ensure  aircraft  protective  armor  is  added  as  needed,  and documented into Ref. 7 of the DD Form 365-4. (T-2). 3.2.15.  The  actual  amount  of  passengers/litter  patients/paratroopers  and  cargo  allowed onboard may vary as determined by aircraft center of gravity limitations.  The aircraft CG is computed after every configuration change prior to the next flight. 3.2.16.  When  seating  passengers  next  to  cargo,  consideration  should  be  given  to  cargo (palletized/rolling  stock)  size  and  adequate  passenger  legroom.    For  cargo  width  up  to  76 inches, passengers may be seated on both sides.  For widths 77-96 inches, passengers may be seated on one side if the cargo is offset to one side laterally.  Do not seat passengers next to cargo for widths 97 inches or greater. (T-3).  For cargo positioned within the wheel well area: cargo  width  up  to  52  inches,  passengers  may  be  seated  on  both  sides;  for  widths  53-72 inches, passengers may be seated on one side of cargo if offset; and for widths 73 inches and greater, the loadmaster will not seat passengers in the wheel well. (T-3). 3.3.  Troop Life Preserver  .  If paratroopers are jumping near or over large bodies of water, the service  being  airdropped  will  furnish  required  life  preservers.  (T-2).    However,  the  loadmaster will ensure life preservers, as indicated in applicable configurations, are still provided as required to cover emergency ditching operations. (T-3). 3.4.  Crew/Passenger/Troop  Drinking  Water.  Each  basic  configuration  provides  for  an adequate  amount  of drinking water.  For example, a two-gallon water container will always be provided;  and  for  missions  requiring  more  water  in  accordance  with  Table  5.3,  additional containers  are  available.    Table  5.3  is  provided  to  assist  in  determining  water  quantities.  AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A  9 JUNE 2017 19 However, the table is not provided as an absolute requirement and should not be used to  cause mission delay or refusal to airlift passengers.  LMs must have water on board; missions cannot be  flown  without  it.  (T-2).        NOTE:  When  deploying  to  an  austere  environment  or  locations where  a  potable  water  source  is  unavailable,  ensure  a  sufficient  amount  of  water  is  onboard  to complete the mission. 3.5.

This chapter contains reference data to assist personnel in load planning. 4.2.  Emergency  Exits  and  Safety  Aisles.  LMs  must  load  aircraft  in  such  a  manner  that  the following emergency exits and safety aisles are available: (T-2). 4.2.1.  The  loadmaster  will  not  position  equipment  in  a  manner  that  obstructs  the  side emergency  escape  hatches.  (T-3).    An  obstruction  is  any  equipment  that  prevents  the effective means of rapid evacuation.  Litters and seats  erected across an emergency exit are not considered to be an obstruction. 4.2.2.  The loadmaster will ensure one unobstructed emergency exit is available for each 20 passengers/troops.  (T-3).    (This  does  not  restrict  overwater  flights  if  the  three  overhead escape hatches are available for egress.) 4.2.3.  The  loadmaster  will  maintain  an  unobstructed  aisleway  in  the  wheel  well  (pallet positions  3  &  4)  and  ramp  area  (pallet  position  6),when  passengers  are  being  airlifted,  to provide  access  to  emergency  exits.  (T-3).    The  loadmaster  will  ensure  the  aisleway  is  a minimum of 14 inches wide, in the wheel well area, between the outer edge of the cargo and the aircraft and begins at the cargo floor or cargo handling system (ECHS) outboard frame. (T-3).    Tiedown  equipment  (463L  nets,  straps,  chains,  and  devices)  are  not  normally considered  an  obstruction.    The  ECHS  outboard  frame  provides  8  inches  of  the  14-inch requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1).  The loadmaster will keep the aisleway a minimum  of  8  inches  beginning  at  the  outboard  edge  of  the  ECHS  outboard  frame,  in  the ramp  area.  (T-3).    The  aisleway  should  normally  be  on  the  left  side  of  the  aircraft.    The loadmaster  will  ensure,  if  the  aisleway  is  placed  on  the  right  side  of  the  aircraft,  then clearance to the right side of the aircraft is still maintained. (T-3).   Additionally, access to aft latrine facilities requires a 20-inch clear area on the forward right side of cargo loaded on the ramp.  The loadmaster will ensure the clear area is on the right side of the pallet. (T-3). 4.2.4.  If  the  aisleway  requirement  in  paragraph  4.2.3  cannot  be  achieved  on  missions carrying crew only or MEPs authorized by operations order/plan or DIRMOBFOR, then an aisleway is maintained in the wheel well area that provides a minimum of 14 inches between the  outer  edge  of  the  cargo  and  aircraft  beginning  no  higher  than  36  inches  above  the floor/pallet/platform  or  a  minimum  of  30  inches  between  the  outer  edge  of  cargo  and  the aircraft  beginning  no  higher  than  60  inches  above  the  floor/pallet/platform.    The  ECHS outboard frame provides 8 inches of this requirement on the main cargo floor (Figure 4.1).  MAJCOM/A3  is  authorized  to  waive  this  requirement  based  on  MAJCOM/A3J  evaluation and recommendation. 4.2.5.  During  airdrop  missions  LMs  shall  have  access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft  to accomplish tactical checklists. (T-3). 4.2.6.  On all missions, the loadmaster will load cargo in such a way that the crew maintains access  to  the  rear  of  the  aircraft.  (T-3).    Loads  in  Section  VI  of  T.O.  1C-130(H)  J-9  are specific and do not require a waiver. 38 AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A  9 JUNE 2017 Figure 4.1.  Safety Aisles (Wheel Well Area W/Passengers).

The  LM  is  responsible  for  entering  weight  and  balance  data  into  the  CNI-MU  Weight  and  Balance  pages,  and  transferring  that  information  onto  the  DD  Form  365-4, Form-F.    This can either be accomplished manually, or electronically utilizing the Automated Form F (AFF) program and printer.  Instructions for use of the AFF program can be found in the C-130 AFF training guide. 5.2.  Load  Planning.  The  LM  must  plan  the  cargo  load  so  the  center  of  gravity  of  the  loaded aircraft  is  within  the  specified  forward  and  aft  limits  for  any  given  operating  condition.  (T-2).  Consideration is also given to offload sequence, aircraft limitations, and emergency jettisoning.  Math  charts  contained  in  T.O.s  1C-130(H)J-5-1  and  1C-130(H)J-5-2  are  tools,  which  may  be used for load planning.  When the fuel load is unknown, load plan for a 20-22 percent of MAC zero fuel. 5.3.  General  Instructions.  These  instructions  apply  to  Transport  Forms  F  using  simplified moments.  Copy the information the CNI-MU Weight and Balance pages onto the Form F, plus the heading information.  The PIC must ensure a copy of the completed DD Form 365-4, Form F is  attached  to  the  flight  plan,  or  given  to  the  controlling  ground  agency,  quality  assurance, transient alert, maintenance, etc. (T-2). 5.3.1.  DD  Form  365-4  Heading.    Enter  date,  mission  number,  aircraft  type,  serial  number, departure  and  destination  station  (name  or  ICAO  identifier),  home  station  of  aircraft,  and PIC's rank and last name. 5.3.2.  Limitations  Column.    Enter  the  appropriate  weight  and  CG  limits  for  the  planned mission using the following criteria:  the maximum gross weight and center of gravity limits specified in T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1 cannot be exceeded.  Gross weights may also be limited by operating  conditions  (i.e.,  obstacle  clearance,  rate  of  climb,  weather  conditions,  altitude, runway/taxiway bearing capacity, or any other published restrictions.)  The PIC will inform the LM of any gross weight restrictions prior to mission planning so an accurate ACL may be obtained. (T-2). 5.3.2.1.  Takeoff.    Unless  other  restrictions  are  imposed,  164,000  lbs.  is  the  maximum weight for takeoff on the HC-130J. 5.3.2.2.  Landing.  Unless other landing restrictions such as assault landings are imposed, 164,000  lbs.  is  the  maximum  weight  for  landing  on  the  HC-130J.    Subtract  operating weight plus estimated landing fuel (references 9 and 23).  Refer to the T.O. 1C-130(H)J-1 for assault landing limitations. 5.3.2.3.  Limiting Wing Fuel.  The CNI-MU is the primary method to compute Limiting Wing  Fuel.    The  limiting  wing  fuel  chart  in  T.O.  1C-130(H)J-1  is  based  on  a  2.5  G maneuver load factor with indicated airspeed restrictions outlined in area "C" of the flight manual  limitation  charts.    LMs  must  compute  specific  mission  requirements  exceeding area "C" limitations using the appropriate flight manual weight limitation charts. (T-2). AFI11-2HC-130JV3_ADDENDA-A  9 JUNE 2017 45 5.3.3.  Permissible C.G. Takeoff and Landing.  Compute the forward and aft center of gravity limitations  using  the  center  of  gravity  table  in  the  appropriate  T.O.  1C-130(H)J-5-2.  Leave the block entitled "Permissible CG Zero Fuel Wt" blank. 5.3.4.  Signature Blocks: 5.3.4.1.  Computed by:  Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate. 5.3.4.2.  Weight and Balance Authority:  Leave blank 5.3.4.3.  Pilot: Signature, rank, and organization on original and duplicate. 5.4.  DD  Form  365-4,  Form  F  Instructions.  Copy  the  information  from  data  entered  in  the CNI-MU Weight and Balance pages and handwrite, type, or computer generate a copy of the DD Form 365-4, Form F.  NOTE:  In the remarks section, enter a breakdown of takeoff fuel weight for  each  tank  to  the  nearest  100  pounds  and  moments  using  the  CNI-MU.      NOTE:    During engine  running  onloads  or  when  planned  ground  times  require,  a  combined  load  C/B  may  be used if a validated load plan is presented, and the aircraft is loaded per the load plan. 5.4.1.  Compute and enter zero  fuel  weight  and zero fuel  moment  by zeroing out  the Take-Off  and  Landing  fuels  on  the  Fuel  page.    Return  to  the  main  weight  and  balance  page  to calculate the Take-off and Landing Zero Fuel Weight.  After calculations have been entered return to the fuel page and return the fuel to its original state.  Zero fuel percent of MAC is not required, but may be helpful when targeting a 20-22 zero fuel percent of MAC. 5.4.2.  Reference 22.  If required, subtract airdrop load weight and moment from reference 21 or  changes  in  corrections  column  and  enter  as  adjusted  zero  fuel  weight/moment  on  first blank line in reference 22.  First blank line title reads, “ADJ ZFW/M”. 5.4.3.  . Use the following criteria to compute fuel burn off when flight plan fuel weights are not available.  (PPH = pounds per hour.) 5.4.3.1.  4,000 PPH - normal flight at altitude. 5.4.3.2.  5,000 PPH - first hour of flight (climb out) or low level. Table 5.1.  HC-130J Paratrooper Loading Tables.
