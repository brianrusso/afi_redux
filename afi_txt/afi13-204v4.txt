Purpose.  The  purpose  of  this  instruction  is  to  establish  procedures  for  the  maintenance management of ground radar and airfield systems equipment. 1.2.  Scope.  This  instruction  applies  to  the  1C8  Ground  Radar/Airfield  Systems  career  fields working  on  ground  radar/airfield  systems  equipment  unless  exempted  by  the  career  field functional  manager.  It  also  applies  to  any  organization  with  production  responsibilities  for ground radar and airfield systems/equipment and processes unless exempted by the appropriate AF-level  functional  manager.  This  includes  all  Air  Force  (AF)  military  and  civilian  personnel, members  of  the  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC),  Air  National  Guard  (ANG),  and  AF contractors. The procedures and practices listed in this instruction are established by Department of Defense (DoD), Air Force Instructions, Air Force Occupational Safety and Health (AFOSH), and  other  guidance.  Note:  Units  using  AF  contractors  will  follow  guidance  provided  in paragraph 1.6, Contract Maintenance. 1.2.1.  Maintenance Objective. The primary objective of maintenance is to ensure continued operational availability of systems  and equipment used to support the Air Force mission. A key  factor  in  achieving  this  objective  is  maintenance  discipline.  Maintenance  discipline involves  integrity  in  all  aspects  of  the  maintenance  process.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  all personnel  to  comply  with  all  written  guidance  to  ensure  required  repairs,  inspections,  and documentation  are  completed  in  a  safe,  timely  and  effective  manner.  Managers  must establish a climate that promotes maintenance discipline. traditional 1.2.2.  Depth  of  Maintenance.  Technology maintenance  concepts  must  be  adapted  to  the  new  environment.  The  depth  and  breadth  of these  concepts  will  vary  considerably  across  the  maintenance  complex.  Normally,  older systems will be more maintenance intensive, than newer equipment sustained under the Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) replacement concept. is  constantly  changing  and 1.2.3.  Readiness  Expectations.  Readiness  requirements  may  cause  deferment  of  essential maintenance  or  training.  Failure  to  recognize  and  support  valid  requirements  might  cause maintenance  backlogs  or  mission  failure.  Managers  must  ensure  every  action  is  taken  to make  systems  available  for  required  maintenance  actions  and  ensure  maintenance  is completed to meet mission requirements. 1.3.

Contract  Maintenance.  This  section  identifies  the  basic  responsibilities  for  managing Most Efficient Organization (MEO) or contract maintenance. 1.6.1.  Compliance. Laws, executive orders, regulation, instructions and technical orders will be  executed  by  the  government  unless  waived  by  appropriate  authority.  When  the government  solicits  services  via  contract,  some  requirements  may  be  excluded  from  the Performance-Based  Work  Statement  (PWS)  or  Statement  of  Work  (SOW)  due  to  cost. Requirements excluded from the PWS or SOW will be performed by the government. AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 9 1.6.1.1.  When  maintenance  management  responsibilities  are  required  of  a  contractor, they must be specifically  identified in  the PWS. Managers will base PWS requirements on  existing  maintenance  policy.  The  intent  and  philosophy  of  organic  maintenance processes  must  be  carefully  considered  and  included  when  appropriate.  Contract maintenance is not automatically exempt from standard logistics processes. For example, the  requirement  to  document  maintenance  in  an  AF-approved  Automated  Information System (AIS) must be included in the PWS. As a minimum, PWSs shall have: (T-1) 1.6.1.1.1.  Contractor  Maintenance  Data  Collection.  Enter  systems  and  component failure  according  to  T.O.  00202,  Maintenance  Data  Documentation;  material consumption  according  to  T.O.  00-20-3,  Maintenance  Processing  of  Repairable Property and Repair Cycle Asset Control System, and TCTO reporting requirements according to T.O. 00-5-15, Air Force Time Compliance Technical Order Process, in PWSs.  Cite  appropriate  data  items  and  include  collecting  TCTO  and  reparable processing data in contracts. Contract instructions call out the time and place to turn in  data.  Specify  if  the  contractor  provides  complete  source  documents  and  forms  or automated products. 1.6.1.1.2.  System restoral priorities. 1.6.1.1.3.  Procedures to maintain configuration control. 1.6.1.1.4.  Procedures  to  document  historical  records  if  AF  automated  information system is unavailable. 1.6.2.  Contract  Surveillance  Programs/Contracting  Office  Representative (COR). Accomplish  contract  maintenance  surveillance  program  duties  according  to  procurement guidelines  and  command  directives.  When  requested  by  the  procurement  office,  the commander/superintendent provides a qualified COR for surveillance purposes. Surveillance programs may vary depending on the scope of the contract and directions of the procurement office.  It  is  vital  military  personnel  do  not  change  or  task  contractors  thus  changing  the contract. 1.6.3.  Contract  Rules and Assistance. Only contracting officers are authorized to  enter into or  change  a  contract,  PWS  or  SOW.  Air  Force  personnel  do  not  give  any  directions  or instructions to contractors or take any other action that could form the basis for a contractual claim.  Direct  problems  with  contract  performance,  contract  changes  or  interpretation  to  the responsible  contracting  officer,  administrative  contracting  officer  or  COR  for  resolution. Contractual  assistance  may  be  used  to  satisfy  a  wide  variety  of  requirements  ranging  from minor  one-time  repairs  to  operation  and  maintenance  of  complete  systems.  For  more information  see  AFI  63-138,  Acquisition  of  Services,  Chapter  6  and  AFPD  64-1,  The Contracting System, paragraph 7.2. 1.6.4.  Impact  on  Wartime  Capabilities.  Consider  contract  maintenance  on  a  planned  and selective  basis;  however,  wartime  capability  may  not  be  compromised  by  excessive  use  of this resource.

Responsibilities of the Production Work Center. 3.2.1.  Assign  a  Job  Control  Number  (JCN)  when  a  loss  of  capability  or  function  in  either equipment/system or service occurs. All jobs will be assigned a JCN. The same JCN will be used on the job and/or applicable equipment status report throughout the life span of the job. The same JCN applies to all actions taken because of the failure/outage. (T-2) 3.2.1.1.  The  JCN  will  remain  open  until  the  job  is  completed,  regardless  of  whether  or not control changes between the work center and other agencies. 3.2.1.2.  Capture  customer  service  request  tracking  number  in  the  IMDS  job  subject line/narrative  (e.g.,  CE  work  order  number,  AT&T  tracking  number,  Fed  Ex  tracking number, etc.). 3.2.1.3.  Work  centers  may  use  the  automatic  JCN  creation  capability  in  IMDS  or  the manual JCN process. 3.2.1.3.1.  If  manual  JCNs  are  used,  contact  the  IMDS  host  Database  Manager (DBM) to obtain a block of JCNs for the work center to use. 3.2.1.3.2.  Work centers will have blocks of JCNs for all jobs and will report status to the customer and other designated activities for all PMC and NMC jobs. 3.2.1.4.  Assign  JCNs  and  maintain  the  status  of  all  active  scheduled,  unscheduled,  and deferred jobs to include pre- and post-deployment actions in IMDS. 3.2.2.  Route  Situation  Reports  (SITREP).  The  work  centers  will  only  forward  the  draft SITREP to the wing command post and request SITREP be sent. Work centers will not issue SITREPs  unless  directed  by  their  MAJCOMs.  For  detailed  SITREP  reporting  instructions, see AFI 10-206, Operational Reporting. (T-3) 3.2.3.  Review and accomplish  all applicable  TCTOs, Time Change  Items  and document in IMDS and any other completion reporting instructions specified within the TCTO. A TCTO is  used  to  document  all  permanent  modifications,  update  changes,  and  retrofit  changes  to standard AF systems and commodities. TCTOs are authorized by T.O. 00-5-1, AF Technical Order  System,  and  published  according  to  T.O.  00-5-15.  They  provide  instructions  for modifying military systems or commodities within specified time limits, initiate special one-time  inspections  or  impose  temporary  restrictions  on  systems  or  commodities.  For  more information  on  permanent  and  temporary  modifications,  see  AFI  63-131,  Modification Management.  For  IMDS  TCTO  processing  and  procedures,  review  Air  Force  Computer Systems  Manual  (AFCSM)  21-568  V2,  Time  Compliance  Technical  Order  Software  User Manual,  found  at  https://ceds.gunter.af.mil/Publications.aspx?AIS=35.  (T-1)  Note: 14 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 TCTOs  for  RMC-supported  equipment  will  be  accomplished  by  or  in  coordination  with RMC personnel. 3.2.4.  Utilize  Restoral  Priorities.  The  work  center  will  work  jobs  in  such  an  order  as  to follow agreed-upon restoral priorities (i.e., work on a lower priority asset would be deferred if  an  outage  on  a  higher  priority  asset  occurs).  Guidance  for  establishing  restoral  priorities and  outage  response  times  is  found  in  AFI  13-204,  Volume  3,  Airfield  Operations Procedures and Programs. (T-2) 3.2.4.1.  Generally,  restoral  priorities  for  key  systems  are  determined  with  all  key base/wing agencies. Many organizations also tie this to the base recovery plan. 3.2.4.2.  Establish  a  Memorandum  of  Agreement  (MOA)  with  the  host  base  CS  or responsible  agency  identifying  all  mission  critical  circuits.  It  is  imperative  that  DISA-scheduled  interruptions,  or  loss  of  service  be  reported  to  the  OSS  immediately.  This process will be identified in the MOA between the CS and OSS. 3.2.5.  Use  locally  generated  tracking  procedures  if  IMDS  is  temporarily  unavailable  and maintain  a  copy  of  locally  generated  documentation  until  IMDS  is  available.  Upon  IMDS restoral, enter all the applicable data as necessary. (T-3) 3.2.5.1.  Document,  maintain,  and  report  system  and/or  equipment  status  according  to AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting, using IMDS. 3.2.5.2.  Review the Open Incident Listing (OIL) to validate accurate status weekly. 3.2.5.3.  Coordinate status changes with all concerned agencies and include start time and estimated  time  of  return  to  operation  (ETRO)  in  the  job  narrative  or  applicable  IMDS field. Update ETROs when the original cannot be met. 3.2.5.4.  Provide a 24-hour point of contact number to all customers, command post, and up-channels. 3.2.6.  Direct,  document,  and  control removal/replacement/cannibalization/controlled substitution actions in accordance with T.O. 00-20-2. For IMDS entries, use AFCSM 21-561 Volume  2,  Integrated  Maintenance  Data  System  (IMDS)  Maintenance  Event  Subsystem (available at the following web site: https://ceds.gunter.af.mil/Publications.aspx?AIS=35) for documentation details. (T-1) 3.2.7.  Act  as  POC  for  depot  and  maintenance  assistance  requests  according  to  T.O.  00-25-108-WA-1. (T-1) 3.2.8.  Complete  annual  review  of  the  Equipment  Inventory  List  (EIL)  and  make  required changes in IMDS. (T-2) 3.2.9.  Verify  master  Preventive  Maintenance  Inspection  (PMI)  schedule  and  all  required PMIs are scheduled and performed at appropriate interval. (T-1) 3.2.9.1.  Prepare/maintain a master PMI schedule and complete annual review and make changes in IMDS. 3.2.10.  Track/update  deferred  PMIs  to  ensure  timely  completion.  (T-1)  Note:  PMIs  will NOT be deferred in Equipment Status Reporting (ESR). AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 15 3.2.10.1.  Update  deferred  PMIs  via  IMDS,  or,  if  unavailable,  the  AFTO  Form  349, Maintenance  Data  Documentation  Record,  in  accordance  with  T.O.  00-20-2  and  in accordance with local procedures. 3.2.10.2.  The timeframe for deferring PMIs will be half of the PMI interval, otherwise it will be considered incomplete; i.e., if the PMI is a 28-day inspection, a unit’s timeframe for deferring will only be 14 days after the original inspection date. In this example, the full  time  for  completion  would  also  be  14  days  before  the  scheduled  date  (normal performing parameters) until the PMI is deferred through the 14 days after the schedule date. 3.2.10.3.  If  the  deferred  PMI  continues  to  the  next  scheduled  PMI,  further  inspections under  the  same  Job  Standard  (JST)  must  be  cancelled.  Do  not  close  out  the  original deferred PMI until its completion. 3.2.10.4.  If a PMI must be deferred for more  than two cycles a waiver request must be sent  to  the  appropriate  Lead  Command  System  Manager  for  action.  These  will  only  be approved when extenuating circumstances prevent proper maintenance. 3.2.11.  Annually review all Service Level Agreements (SLA), Memorandum of Agreements (MOA), and/or Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with outside organizations. Maintain SLA, MOA or MOU for providing back-up services as needed. (T-1) 3.3.  Work Center Supervisors will: 3.3.1.  Ensure shift continuity is maintained, via the following: (T-1) 3.3.1.1.  Review  all  open  jobs  for  accuracy  and  to  ensure  the  most  up-to-date status/information is captured. 3.3.1.2.  Acquire  appropriate  IMDS  management-level  access  (to  include  background rights). 3.3.1.3.  Brief scheduled actions and situations that could adversely impact the mission. 3.3.1.4.  Provide  a  standby  telephone  number  to  supported  mission  organizations,  if  the work center does NOT conduct 24-hour operations. 3.3.2.  Process  DPEM  and  maintenance  assistance  requests  according  to  T.O.  00-25-108-WA-1. (T-1) Note: Not applicable to ANG and AFRC units. DPEM program is managed at the NGB and AFRC. 3.3.2.1.  Submit  completed  depot  requests  (e.g.  AFTO  Form  227,  C-E  Depot Maintenance  Requirements  and  Schedule)  through  AF  Portal  via  System  Requirement Management Application (D). 3.3.2.2.  Obtain a SRMA account to submit AFTO Form 227s for depot support by going to the AF Portal, in Applications select SRMA, fill out the CAFDEx Registration, and fill out  and  submit  the  DD  Form  2875,  System  Authorization  Access  Request,  IAW  the instructions on the registration page. For further information on submitting AFTO Form 227s, see T.O. 00-25-108-WA-1. 3.3.2.3.  When Emergency Depot  Level  Maintenance (EDLM) support is  required, refer to T.O. 00-25-108-WA-1. 16 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 3.3.3.  Review  EIL  annually  in  IMDS  to  ensure  all  work  center-supported  assets/resources are accurately reflected/listed. (T-2) 3.3.4.  Report  all  Job  Data  Documentation  (JDD)  and  perform  all  ESR  reporting.  JDD reporting for systems will be required as follows: TCTO, SBSS, NRTS, and PMI scheduling. (T-1) 3.3.5.  Schedule, monitor, control, and coordinate efforts for production. (T-1) 3.3.5.1.  Dispatch  personnel  with  the  technical  data  and  support  items  needed  to troubleshoot, repair, and restore systems in an expedient manner. 3.3.5.2.  Ensure  work  center  personnel  comply  with  standards  and  schedules  and promptly respond to scheduled and unscheduled support requirements. 3.3.6.  Ensure  personnel  receive  flight  line  drivers  training  as  required  prior  to  entering aerodrome. (T-1) 3.4.  Critical  Outage  Reporting.  With  the  exception  of  ANG,  work  center(s)  maintaining systems  referenced  in  Table  3.1.,  will  submit  Critical  Outage  Reports  (COR)  via  email.  Use Table  3.2.  as  a  template.  ATCALS/DATCALS  outages  need  to  be  reported  to  corresponding MAJCOM  office,  respective  Special  Maintenance  Team  (SMT)  function,  and  HQ  AFFSA System Management (HQAFFSA.XMS@us.af.mil) within 1 (one) hour.

AFMAN  11-225  United  States  Standard  Flight  Inspection  Manual  (applicable sections for assigned equipment). 3.5.1.2.  T.O.  31Z3-822-2-WA-1,  Air  Traffic  Control  and  Landing  Systems  (ATCALS) Site Requirements 404L (ATCALS site requirements 404L). 3.5.1.3.  AFI 13-204, Volume 3 (Applicable chapters). 18 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 3.5.1.4.  AFI 13-204, Volume 4. 3.6.  Facility  Requirements.  Equipment  technical  orders/maintenance  handbooks  may  require PMI  measurement  data  record  entries  by  qualified  technicians  on  a  reoccurring  basis. Documentation  of  the  completion  of  these  PMIs  or  other  required  performance  measurements will  meet  the  ATCALS  facility  requirements.  There  will  be  no  separate  formal  ATCALS certification program or requirement. All certification requirements will be met by fully qualified technicians performing PMI procedures in the technical orders to validate key parameters against the  facility  references  or  TO  specification.  Documentation  of  these  PMIs  will  done  through IMDS.  ATCALS  are  Air  Traffic  Control  (ATC)  radar,  meteorological,  navigational,  and  air traffic radio, console, and recorder technologies. (T-1) 3.7.  Facility  Records.  Maintain  a  facility  record  at  each  ATCALS  facility  (may  not  be applicable to radio sites). This record is a transitory portion of the equipment historical file. The site  applicable  forms  prescribed  in  T.O.  31Z3-822-2-WA-1  and  system  specific  certification forms, when outlined by equipment technical orders/maintenance handbooks, are mandatory and must  be  completely  filled  out.  Superseded  data  will  be  retained  in  the  work  center  equipment historical file. Facility records for equipment maintained by  the RMC will be maintained at the RMC,  not  the  local  site.  Electronic  facility  records  are  authorized.  The  facility  record  will contain the following information: (T-1) 3.7.1.  Tab  1,  Reference  Data.  Contains  the  reference  flight  inspection  report  and  all  data recorded following the reference flight inspection. Each page must be clearly marked at the top, “REFERENCE DATA,” with the effective date of the reference data. When references do change as a result of maintenance, parts replacements, etc., make a single line in red pen through  the  changed  item  on  the  original  reference  data  worksheet,  annotate  the  new reference,  and  add  the  date  the  change  was  made.  When  the  reference  values  are  changed, explain the reason for the change in any of the available remarks blocks. 3.7.2.  Tab 2, Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI). Contains data recorded during PMIs as  required  by  applicable  maintenance  technical  manuals.  All  required  blocks  on  the appropriate  forms  must  be  completed.  An  explanation  is  required  in  the  remarks  section  of the  form  if  required  data  is  not  recorded.  The  remarks  section  of  the  form  may  be  used  to document  trends/adjustments  made  during  PMIs.  If  adjustments  are  made  during  the  PMI, the final reading will be recorded. Note: For systems where the equipment technical manuals require certification, the certification forms will be filed in this tab. The most recent piece of certification data will be kept in the facility record and the previous two years of certification data will be maintained in equipment historical records. For command unique equipment, use locally generated or MAJCOM generated forms. 3.7.3.  Tab  3,  Periodic  Flight  Inspection  Reports.  Contains  the  latest  two  periodic  flight inspection  reports  and  the  FAA  Form  8240-22,  Facility  Data  Sheet  (validate  accuracy  and currency with terminal instrument procedures). 3.7.4.  Tab  4,  PMI  Ground  Check.  Contains  data  recorded  during  PMIs  to  determine radiation  characteristics  as  required  by  technical  manuals.  Note:  Not  required  for  radar equipment. 3.7.5.  Tab 5, Other Data. Include pertinent site information not filed elsewhere. Items may include  the  most  recent:  Mobile  Depot  Maintenance,  grounding  measurements,  SMT  trip AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 19 report,  ATCALS  Evaluation,  Air  Force  Engineering  and  Technical  Service  (AFETS)  trip report and earth ground check documentation. 3.8.  ATCALS Maintenance Special Considerations For Removing NAVAID Identification Signals.  Aircrews are trained to consider the navigation signal unreliable when identification is not received or the identification code is “T E S T” (- . … -). The removal of identification is not a substitute for Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) requirements. Remove identification or transmit “T E  S  T”  identification  when  the  NAVAID  facility  is  out  of  service.  The  preferred  method  is  to remove identification when performing maintenance. (T-1) 3.9.  ATCALS  Facility  Reference  Data.  If  the  facility  cannot  be  returned  to  the  established facility references, but facility performance meets or exceeds technical order specifications  and can  be  verified  with  a  ground  check,  the  facility  is  considered  usable.  Perform  complete  data collection  and  forward  existing  facility  reference  data  and  newly  recorded  data  to  HQ AFFSA/XMR  within  5  duty  days  for  analysis.  HQ  AFFSA/XMR  coordinates  with  SMT  to determine if further adjustments are required, or if a special (reference) flight inspection should be  accomplished  to  establish  new  facility  references.  If  proper  facility  performance  cannot  be verified  with  a  ground  check,  report  the  facility’s  condition  to  the  senior  air  traffic  control supervisor  as  unusable  and  request  SMT  assistance  in  accordance  with  T.O.  00-25-108-WA-1. (T-1) 3.10.  Non-ATCALS  Equipment.  ATCALS  work  centers  maintaining  equipment  that  they  do not  have  ownership  of  will  obtain  a  local  MOA  or  SOW  for  maintenance  of  non-ATCALS equipment. This document must be reviewed annually, by all parties. (T-3) 3.11.  Work Center Duties and Responsibilities for Remotely Maintained Equipment. 3.11.1.  Provide a 24-hour point of contact to the RMC to facilitate augmentation duties. (T-1) 3.11.2.  Work  directly  with  the  RMC  to  replace  failed  assemblies  IAW  RMC  local augmentation guide.

This chapter addresses maintenance management policies for all units with a mobility mission. Regardless of the unit’s organizational structure the principles of maintenance management shall be followed to ensure efficient and effective maintenance. Note: The contents of  this  chapter  are  meant  as  additional  requirements  for  Unit  Type  Code  (UTC)  based  work centers.  Production  work  center  maintenance  practices  and  requirements  must  be  adhered  to  in accordance with this AFI. 4.2.  Scope.  In-garrison maintenance, pre-deployment planning, and pre-deployment preparation are  critical  to  ensuring  equipment  and  personnel  readiness  when  tasked  for  contingency operations.  Maintenance  management  procedures  in  a  deployed  environment  must  be appropriately  scaled  to  balance  maintenance  requirements  against  operational  commitments. Personnel  at  all  levels  must  leverage  opportunities  to  compensate  for  the  inefficiencies  of contingency operations. 4.2.1.  All units with a deployable Ground Radar or Airfield Systems mission and deployable UTC,  will  apply  and  perform  the  management  policies  prescribed  within  this  instruction unless otherwise specified. Regardless of the unit’s organizational structure, the principles of management  will  be  followed  to  ensure  efficient  and  effective  activities  in  the  deployed environment. 4.2.2.  Units  with  deployable  missions  will  designate  a  deployed  UTC  Team  Lead  prior  to deployment  and  support  management  functions  and  activities.  The  appointed  UTC  Team Lead,  managing  functions  structured  by  UTC,  will  ensure  these  functions  adhere  to  the principles  of  a  production  work  center  in  accordance  with  Chapters  2  and  3  of  this document. 4.2.3.  The  deployed  commander/superintendent  is  responsible  for  overall  management, while equipment/UTC Team Leads are responsible for ensuring their personnel comply with established guidance. Deployed maintenance management focuses on delivering the required operational capabilities while limiting operation interruptions. 4.3.  Deployed Site Commander Duties and Responsibilities. 4.3.1.  Ensure  authorized  unit  weapons  and  ammunition  are  stored  and  issued  according  to DOD and Air Force directives. (T-1) 4.3.2.  Establish  a  24-hour  point  of  contact  for  each  deployed  equipment/UTC  and  ensure they perform Maintenance Operations Center function. (Responsibilities may be assigned to Team Leads) (T-1) 4.3.3.  Ensure  Inspection  and  Evaluation  (I&E)  duties  are  performed  by  appointing  one  or more personnel to I & E duties when necessary as described in paragraph 4.5. (T-1) 4.3.4.  Develop written guidance that outlines how to plan, schedule, monitor, control, report, and provide support for equipment maintenance and circuit restoral actions on all local and subordinate units. (T-1) 4.4.  Maintenance Operation Center Function Responsibilities. 22 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 4.4.1.  Contact  the  appropriate  agency  to  request  IMDS  connectivity  or  verify  that connectivity is already established. (T-2) 4.4.2.  Assign a JCN to each equipment/UTC for initial operational or system checks during setup.  These  JCNs  may  be  issued  upon  arrival  at  the  deployment  site  or  prior  to  departure from home station to minimize disruption during initial setup at the deployed site. Deployed IMDS updates will be completed as soon as access is obtained. (T-2) 4.4.3.  Track  milestones  such  as  the  maintenance-ready  condition  of  equipment/UTCs, installation of telephone lines, and the setup or tear down of power generators, antennas, and signal cable runs. (T-2) 4.4.4.  Coordinate  external  maintenance  support  for  equipment/UTCs  with  host  nation support  activities  (i.e.,  vehicle  maintenance,  Petroleum,  Oil,  &  Lubricants  (POL),  civil engineering, etc.) or verify support is already in place. (T-2) 4.4.5.  Ensure  all  systems  subject  to  FAA  flight  inspection  meet  inspection  requirements prior  to  being  placed  into  service.  AFMAN  11-225,  authorizes  military  commanders  to authorize use of the systems without current flight inspections for military only. (T-1) 4.4.6.  Review ESR and maintenance data documentation for completion. (T-2) 4.5.  Inspections and Evaluations (I&E).  In most cases, UTC evaluations will not be required in  the  deployed  environment.  However,  reconstitution  and  redeployment  of  equipment/UTCs demands the accomplishment of evaluations. Ensure the following I&E duties are performed: (T-1) 4.5.1.  Conduct or participate in site transfer inspections when relieving/replacing personnel at a deployed location. This will only be done if previously deployed equipment/UTCs will remain  in  place  at  the  deployed  location.  Site  transfer  inspections  ensure  systems  are operational,  problems  are  identified,  and  equipment  inventory  is  complete  and  capable  of meeting mission requirements. 4.5.2.  Document  site  transfer  inspections  within  15  days  after  assuming  maintenance responsibility.  If  possible,  perform  inspection  with  incoming  and  outgoing  personnel. Inspection will include the following areas as a minimum: 4.5.2.1.  Accomplish  minimum  essential  checks  as  specified  by  the  site  commander  to ensure  the  systems  are  operating  within  required  parameters  in  accordance  with associated technical data. 4.5.2.2.

Inspections  and  Evaluations  (I&E)  provide  a  process  to  ensure  mission accomplishment  occurs  within  the  confines  of  public  law,  DoD/AF  policy  and  guidance  and technical orders. I&E also provides an analysis, reporting and deficiency resolution capability. It serves  as  the  tool  for  ensuring  that  a  process,  equipment,  system,  end  item  or  service  is  of  the type and quality to meet or exceed requirements for effective mission operations. 7.1.1.  Applicability  and  Authority.  I&E  is  applicable  to  all  base  field-level  units  with Ground Radar and Airfield Systems personnel. Those units will apply and perform the I&E policies  prescribed  within  this  instruction  and  applicable  checklists.  Unit  leadership  is responsible  for  the  safety  and  quality  of  equipment  operation,  training,  and  production. Additionally,  quality  and  equipment  reliability  is  the  responsibility  of  all  personnel performing mission operations. These actions will utilize the AFIS self-assessment program as detailed in AFI 90-201, The Air Force Inspection System, and Capstone inspection to meet compliance  and  evaluation  requirements.  Note:  ATCS  and  GTACS  units  will  continue  to provide local QA support and will establish guidance for their work centers. NGB/A2/3/6A will establish guidance for fixed ANG work centers. 7.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. 7.2.1.  Fixed-Base  Units.  All  fixed-base  ATCALS/Weather  will  meet  requirements  as specified  in  Unit  Effectiveness  Inspection  (UEI)  criteria,  outlined  in  AFI  90-201.  The  UEI team  evaluator  will  follow  the  general  evaluation  guidelines  outlined  in  Attachment  2  and document the results in the UEI report. 7.2.2.  Mobile Units. UTC evaluations will consist of three separate components designed to measure  readiness:  personnel  readiness  evaluation,  equipment  readiness  evaluation  and acceptance  readiness  inspection  when  new  or  overhauled  equipment  is  received  from  the manufacturer/depot. 7.3.  Self-Inspection/Assessment  Program.  Operations  group  and/or  operations  support squadron  commanders  will  appoint  a  work  center  self-assessment  program  manager,  who  will oversee  the  work  center’s  self-inspection/assessment  program  as  outlined  in  AFI  90-201, Chapter 6. 7.3.1.  Work  center  NCOICs  are  responsible  for  overseeing  the  application  of  MICT checklists per MAJCOM/wing guidance. They shall provide all necessary documentation to the unit MICT manager, adhering to the Commander’s Inspection Program. Use Attachment 4, Sampling Plan, for all equipment inspections. 7.4.  Managerial Evaluations (ME).  MEs will be performed during UEIs utilizing the AFIS. 7.5.  Personnel Evaluations (PE). 7.5.1.  Overview.  The  personnel  evaluation  program  assesses  the  effectiveness  of  a  work center’s  training  program,  technician  competence,  and  technical  and  procedural  data adequacy. These evaluations ensure equipment or systems are maintained in an effective and efficient  manner  to  meet  mission  requirements.  The  evaluation  can  be  accomplished  on  a 36 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 system,  equipment  or  service-oriented  function  the  technician  is  qualified  to  perform  (i.e., align  radar  system,  repair  navigation  system,  follow  a  written  process,  etc.).  Evaluators observe  how  well  processes  are  performed  to  determine  if  the  technician  demonstrates sufficient skill to accomplish the tasks. 7.5.2.  There  are  four  types  of  PEs:  individual  evaluations,  UTC  evaluations,  special evaluations, and equipment personnel evaluations. 7.5.2.1.  Individual Personnel Evaluation (IPE). This evaluation is completed on all 1C8 enlisted  personnel  within  one  year  of  initial  assignment  to  an  organization  and  upon return to the production work center after an absence of one year or longer. This does not apply to MSgt - CMSgt  unless they are task qualified to maintain equipment. Air Force Reserve  Command  (AFRC)  and  Air  National  Guard  (ANG)  personnel  conduct  this evaluation  within  two  years  of  assignment.  For  short  tour  overseas  assignments  of  18 months or less, IPEs will be accomplished no later than 9 months’ time on station. (T-1) 7.5.2.2.  UTC Personnel Evaluations (UTC PE). UTC evaluations assess UTC personnel readiness  against  the  UTC  MISCAP  and  ensure  mission  reliability.  UTC  PEs  are completed  on  all  1C8  personnel  assigned  to  UTC-based  organizations  whose  primary mission is to deploy. These evaluations will be completed within 90 days (180 days for ANG/AFRC) after an individual is reported as Status of Reporting and Training System (SORTS)/  Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Force  Reporting  Tool  (ART)  qualified  by  their supervisor.  These  evaluations  can  be  accomplished  during  field  training  exercises  and other internal  training opportunities. Team  UTC PEs are encouraged. These evaluations do not  apply to UTCs that  do not  have an equipment/technical  component.  (T-1)  Note: This evaluation can be accomplished in conjunction with the initial personnel evaluation and/or replace the initial personnel evaluation. If an individual is permanently reassigned to  another  UTC  or  the  primarily  assigned  UTC  has  major  changes  (e.g.,  equipment replacement, new tasks identified) another UTC PE is required. 7.5.2.3.  Special Personnel Evaluation (SPE). Special PEs are conducted on an as-needed basis.  Commonly  these  evaluations  are  conducted  after  major  modifications  of equipment/systems,  or  reevaluation  of  an individual who received a Not  In Compliance (NIC)  result  from  a  previous  evaluation,  or  who  has  had  his/her  qualification  status revoked for any reason other than supervisor decertification. (T-1) 7.5.2.3.1.  Modification  SPEs  are  required  within  60  days  of  new  equipment/system acceptance  on  a  sampling  of  assigned  active  duty  personnel.  Modification  PEs  are required  within  120  days  of  new  equipment/system  acceptance  on  a  sampling  of ANG/AFRC  personnel.  A  major  modification  is  defined  as  changes  to  published operating  system  parameters,  specifications,  requirements  or  any  change  that  will revise published safety procedures. 7.5.2.3.2.  Reevaluation SPEs are the assessment of an individual who received a NIC result from a previous evaluation, or who has had his/her qualification status revoked for  any  reason  other  than  supervisor  decertification.  Reevaluation  will  be  conduct within  90  days  after  notification  of  recertification  by  the  individual’s  supervisor. ANG  and  AFRC  will  be  reevaluated  within  120  days.  The  reevaluation  of  an individual whose previous evaluation resulted in a NIC will include only the specific AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 37 tasks graded NIC, or the combination of the tasks that resulted in the NIC, unless the individual’s leadership determines a complete reevaluation is necessary. 7.5.2.4.  Equipment Personnel Evaluation (EPE). Equipment evaluations are conducted to ensure  technicians  meet  proficiency  requirements.  The  evaluation  must  evaluate  the technician’s  ability  to  determine  when  a  facility  should  be  reported  for  possible termination of service and under what  conditions  the equipment/facility can be returned to  service.  Evaluations  should  measure  the  technician’s  capability  to  perform  standard maintenance  practices  and should  be accomplished during UEI Capstone events at the inspector’s discretion, unless prescribed by a formal agreement. (T-1) troubleshooting  processes.  Evaluations 7.5.3.  Conducting Evaluations. 7.5.3.1.  Evaluators.  Evaluations  will  be  conducted  by  either  a  MSgt,  work  center supervisor,  or  7-level  technician  as  long  as  the  evaluator  is  not  the  individual’s  trainer. Evaluators  must  make  careful  observations  of  actions  taken  to  accomplish  the  process being  evaluated  and  each  evaluator  shares  the  responsibility  for  safe  mission  conduct with the individual being evaluated. Whenever an evaluator observes a breach of security, safety,  discipline  or  procedure  during  the  evaluation,  the  evaluator  will  take  immediate corrective action to ensure mission operations, security, and safety. Evaluators can serve as safety observers if they meet all safety requirements. 7.5.3.2.  Before the Evaluation. Before the evaluation, evaluators must analyze and select tasks to be evaluated based on the type of evaluation, mission requirement, trend analysis indicators,  training  management  visits,  system  performance  data  (metrics),  previous evaluations  done in  the  work center,  and other  management indicators requiring special emphasis.  Evaluators  then  select  tasks  not  previously  evaluated  in  the  work  center  of which  at  least  two-thirds  are  performance-based  and  the  remaining  third  are  common knowledge  core  tasks  as  identified  in  the  ITP.  For  UTC  Personnel  Evaluations,  the evaluator  will  assess  a  minimum  number  of  tasks  to  ensure  proper  pre-deployment, employment, and redeployment of the assigned UTC. These tasks will be selected from the individual’s Training Business Area (TBA) Individual Training Plan (ITP) and align to the UTC Mission Capability (MISCAP). 7.5.3.2.1.  Consider  all  equipment  when  selecting  tasks  for  personnel  evaluations  to adequately  assess  the  work  center  training  program  effectiveness.  Although individuals  may  be  evaluated  on  any  task(s)  they  are  qualified  on,  evaluators  select processes  that  are  comprehensive  (consists  of  many  basic  tasks)  in  nature  (e.g., alignments).  Usually,  actionable  events  or  jobs  tracked  in  IMDS  fulfill  this requirement. 7.5.3.2.2.  Select  alternate  tasks  to  avoid  the  need  to  reschedule  an  evaluation  when operational requirements do not permit completion of planned evaluations. 7.5.3.2.3.  Brief the technician on the tasks to be evaluated, the rating/grading criteria, and the performance standards prior to beginning the evaluation. Evaluators focus on the  evaluation  process,  not  the  specific  evaluation  steps  the  individual  must accomplish  to  pass.  Emphasize that the goal  is  to  determine the  effectiveness  of the 38 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 work center’s training program, not to pass the evaluation. The evaluator must advise the technician of the following: 7.5.3.2.3.1.  The evaluation starts when the technician begins the task, or portion of  the  task  to  be  evaluated,  and  is  completed  when  the  entire  task  or  previously determined portion of the task is finished. 7.5.3.2.3.2.  All maintenance actions performed are subject to evaluation. 7.5.3.2.3.3.  Safety and security should not be compromised for any reason. 7.5.3.2.3.4.  All detected errors during the evaluation will be used to calculate an overall  award  of  Complies  (C),  Complies  With  Comments  (CWC),  or  Not  In Compliance (NIC). 7.5.3.2.3.5.  The  technician  must  notify  the  evaluator  of  applicable  information that could affect the task evaluation. This includes any Previously Complied With (PCW)  task(s)/step(s)  (i.e.  a  setup  task  for  tactical  equipment  requires  driving  a ground rod, however the evaluation is conducted in a bay, so the technician hooks to a facility ground instead). If the technician fails to do this, they may be charged with an error for requirements that were omitted during the task performance that were not identified as PCW prior to the evaluation critique. 7.5.3.2.3.6.  The  evaluator  may  ask  questions  or  inject  a  task  to  determine technician/team knowledge of the task under evaluation. The technician may use technical references to answer any questions. 7.5.3.3.  During the Evaluation. Evaluate the process from beginning to end. The process refers  to  three  phases:  preparation,  task  performance,  and  post  completion  procedures. Ref. Air Force Maintenance Quality Control Checklist (AFMQCC) 100-1. 7.5.3.3.1.  Stop  the  evaluation  if  technicians  use  methods  or  procedures  that  could jeopardize  safety,  reliable  environment,  violate  security  or  cause  system/equipment damage.  Task  evaluations  may  be  continued  (at  the  evaluator’s  discretion)  after  the hazard is corrected. 7.5.3.3.2.  Ask questions on the system knowledge, methods, and procedures used by the technician. However, questions should not distract the technician from the task at hand. Questioning before and after task accomplishment is best. 7.5.3.3.3.  Assess  a  technician’s  task  performance  according  to  Attachment  2. Technicians are to accomplish the task independently and without outside assistance unless the task requires multiple personnel as directed by guidance. 7.5.3.3.4.  Report  Technical  Order  errors  or  deficiencies  discovered  during evaluations according to T.O. 00-5-1. Deficiencies in AFMSIs are reported according to this instruction. The work center will be responsible for correcting deficiencies in LWCs. 7.5.3.3.5.  The  evaluator  may  terminate  the  remaining  portion  of  a  task  if  the technician has demonstrated technical competency. The evaluator cannot terminate all remaining tasks for the evaluation. AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 39 7.5.3.3.6.  Capture  specific  examples  of  how  the  individual  performed  various  tasks for the report. 7.5.3.4.  After the Evaluation. At the conclusion of the evaluation, evaluators will provide an  initial  out  brief  to  the  work  center  supervisor  and  the  technician.  Evaluators  will complete and submit a written report IAW Attachment 2. 7.6.  Equipment  Evaluations  (EE).  The  evaluation  of  systems  maintained  by  the  work  center will  be  conducted  as  part  of  the  AFIS  by  completing  the  applicable  portions  of  the  self-inspection  checklist  in  the  Management  Internal  Control  Toolset  (MICT)  database.  During  the UEI Capstone event, the respective IG team will validate and verify the results of the unit’s self-inspections. Attachment 4, Sampling Plan, can be utilized for equipment evaluations consisting of multiple like items. (T-1) 7.7.  UTC Evaluations.  UTC evaluations will consist of three separate components designed to measure  readiness:  personnel  readiness  evaluation,  equipment  readiness  evaluation  and acceptance  readiness  inspection  when  new  or  overhauled  equipment  is  received  from  the manufacturer/depot. The components of the UTC inspection can be accomplished separately or grouped  together  into  one  evaluation  depending  on  availability  of  equipment  and  personnel.  If grouped together, there  will only be one report  versus  separate reports for each  equipment  end item/person. (T-1) 7.7.1.  Frequency of evaluations. The intervals are as follows: 7.7.1.1.  UTC  personnel.  When  assigned  to  a  UTC  or  once  every  24  months  if  already assigned  to  a  UTC.  Number  of  tasks  evaluated  is  at  the  discretion  of  the  evaluator,  but should be UTC readiness oriented. 7.7.1.2.  UTC  equipment.  Pre-deployment,  post  deployment,  and  once  every  24  months beginning from last post deployment inspection if not deployed. 7.7.1.3.  UTC  acceptance.  As  required  when  equipment manufacturer or depot. is  received  from the 7.7.2.  UTC Personnel Evaluations (UTC PE). Refer to paragraph 7.5.2.2. for UTC Personnel Evaluation  information.  Refer  to  paragraph  7.5.3.  through  7.5.3.4.  for  evaluator  selection criteria  and  procedures  for  conducting  UTC  PEs.  Note:  These  evaluations  can  be accomplished  in  conjunction  with  the  initial  personnel  evaluation  and/or  replace  the  initial personnel  evaluation.  If  an  individual  is  permanently  reassigned  to  another  UTC  or  the primarily  assigned  UTC  has  major  changes  (e.g.,  equipment  replacement,  new  tasks identified) another UTC PE is required. 7.7.3.  UTC  Equipment  Evaluations  (UTC  EE).  UTC  equipment  evaluations  assess  mission readiness against the UTC MISCAP and ensures mission reliability. UTC EEs are completed on all equipment assigned to UTC-based organizations whose primary mission is to deploy. These  evaluations  are  intended  to  ensure  that  equipment  is  operating  within  the  same capabilities  as  reported  in  SORTS/ART.  The  evaluations  can  be  accomplished  during  field training  exercises  and  other  internal  training  opportunities  when  available.  Team  UTC  EEs are  encouraged.  These  evaluations  do  not  apply  to  UTCs  that  do  not  have  an equipment/technical component. 40 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 7.7.3.1.  UTC  EEs  should  include  highest  order  PMI  and  below  to  evaluate  that equipment  is  operating  within  tolerances  in  accordance  with  governing  technical orders/instructions, manuals, and/or COTS documentation. limitations  or 7.7.3.2.

Certification  will  be limited to the type of structures required to accomplish work center task requirements. 9.3.3.  Certification Resources. Installations without a climbing certifier will use an alternate source  for  climbing  certification  (e.g.,  AF  Mobile  Training  Team,  local  climbing  courses, E&I, Cable and Antenna Teams, SMT, etc.). AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 43 Chapter 10 LOGISTICS, LIFE CYCLE AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT 10.1.  Introduction.  This  chapter  provides  logistics  life  cycle  management  procedures  for mission  systems  and  equipment.  It  is  intended  to  assist  and  direct  managers  in  a  systematic approach  to  resolving  mission  systems  and  equipment  sustainability  problems  and  making critical  logistics  decisions.  The  chapter  provides  framework  and  elements  to  establish sustainability processes for mission systems and equipment support. 10.2.  Air  Force  Centrally supported equipment/systems  are  managed  by  a  PMO  according  to  AFI  63-101/20-101.  The  PMO  is responsible  for  the  equipment’s  logistics  life  cycle  management  and  OSS&E  according  to AFMCI 63-1201, Implementing Operational Safety, Suitability and Effectiveness and Life Cycle Systems Engineering (LCSE). Supported  Equipment/Systems.  Centrally 10.3.  Non-Centrally  Supported  Equipment/Systems.  The  PMO  does  not  manage  non-centrally  supported  equipment.  For  this  type  of  equipment,  the  procuring  activity  (i.e., MAJCOM,  unit,  etc.)  is  responsible  for  all  life  cycle  sustainment  planning  and  OSS&E. Effective  logistics  life  cycle  management  for  both  centrally  supported  and  non-centrally supported equipment is essential to meet mission requirements. 10.4.  Life Cycle Management Plans.  Whether purchased for AF, MAJCOM, base or unit use, all  mission  systems  and  equipment  will  have  a  Life  Cycle  Management  Plans  (LCMP). MAJCOM/Base/Unit  acquired  COTS/GOTS  systems  and  equipment  will  document  the sustainment support strategy in an LCMP. The LCMP starts from the high-level logistics support strategy  and  becomes  more  refined.  By  the  Production  and  Deployment  phase  (JCIDS  - Milestone C) or Build and Test phase (IT Lean Reengineering  - Test Readiness Review 2), the LCMP will be very detailed. 10.4.1.  In  accordance  with  AFPAM  63-128,  Integrated  Life  Cycle  Management,  as  a minimum,  managers  must  consider  the  following  LCMP  sustainment  elements  to  help manage, control, sustain, and dispose of mission systems and equipment: 10.4.1.1.

Test Measurement, and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE) is critical to proper operation  and  maintenance  of  mission  systems.  Out-of-tolerance  TMDE  can  cause  mission systems  to  be  misaligned  or  erroneously  declared  unserviceable.  Man-hours  and  parts  may  be expended  unnecessarily  to  restore  already  serviceable  equipment.  Personnel  who  use  TMDE must understand their responsibilities and the procedures for the use and care of TMDE. TMDE management  is  critical  to  proper  operation  and  maintenance  of  mission  systems.  Proper  use, handling,  storage,  transportation,  and  calibration  are  essential  to  ensure  TMDE  accurately performs its function. 13.1.1.  TMDE  Definition.  Any  device  used  to  maintain,  evaluate,  measure,  calibrate, diagnose  or  otherwise  examine  materials,  supplies,  equipment,  and  systems  to  identify  or isolate  actual  or  potential  malfunction/discrepancies/deficiencies  or  decide  if  they  meet operational  specification  established  in  technical  publications.  Some  examples  of  test equipment  are fiber testers, cable tester, spectrum analyzers, etc. See T.O. 00-20-14-WA-1, for details. 13.1.2.  Applicability  and  References.  TMDE  and  Tool  management  applies  to  all  sections supporting  maintenance.  All  technicians  will  be  knowledgeable  of  T.O.  00-25-234-WA-1; T.O.  00-20-14-WA-1,  Air  Force  Metrology  and  Calibration  Program;  T.O.  33K-1-100-1-WA-1,  Calibration  Procedure  –  Maintenance  Data  Collection  Codes  and  Calibration Measurement  Summaries;  T.O.  33K-1-100-2-WA-1,  Material  Management  Procedures; AFMAN 23-122, Technical Manual TMDE Calibration Interval Technical Order and Work Unit Code Reference Guide; any applicable CMS T.O.s;  T.O. 00-25-234-WA-1; T.O. 33-1-27-WA-1, Logistic Support of Test, Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment; T.O. 33-1-32-WA-1,  General  Instructions  for  Input  Power  Wiring  of  Electrical/Electronic  Support Equipment, and any applicable commercial manuals/guides. 13.1.3.  Ensure all work center technicians’ document training according to AFI 36-2201. If local tasks are required, ensure tasks are identified, added to the training plan, and training is conducted. 13.1.4.  Establish  limited  calibration  requirements  whenever  possible.  This  eliminates  time spent to calibrate unused functions or ranges and expedites return of the TMDE to the work center. However, before establishing limited calibration, consider the following: 13.1.4.1.  Determine  the  functions  and  ranges  needed  for  all  mission  systems  and equipment  supported  by  the  TMDE  in  the  work  center.  TMDE  needs  to  be  calibrated only for those functions and ranges used. 13.1.4.2.  TMDE shared  by two or more work centers must be calibrated  for the  ranges and tolerances required by each using work center. 13.2.  General TMDE Requirements. 13.2.1.  Request priority calibration or repair, through the work center TMDE monitor, only when  justified  to  meet  urgent  mission  requirements.  Pick  up  the  TMDE  from  Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory (PMEL) as soon as the priority calibration is completed. 58 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 13.2.2.  Request  an  extension  of  the  calibration  due  date,  through  the  work  center  TMDE monitor, if loss of the TMDE will delay or prevent critical mission accomplishment. 13.2.3.  Provide  or  arrange  for  training  of  work  center  personnel  on  proper  use  and  care  of TMDE, including how to determine calibration condition and limitations. 13.2.4.  Advise  the  work  center  project  coordinator  of  problems  in  obtaining  or  calibrating TMDE needed to install or maintain mission systems scheduled for installation. 13.2.5.  Notify commander or designated representative/equivalent  when  the lack of TMDE impacts completion of the work center’s mission. 13.2.5.1.  Work centers are required to perform TMDE User Responsibilities according to T.O. 00-20-14-WA-1, paragraph 3.6. 13.2.5.2.  Personnel  are  responsible  to  provide  proper  care,  handling,  cleanliness  and transportation of TMDE according to T.O. 00-20-14-WA-1, paragraph 3.8. 13.2.6.  Replacement TMDE may be required if PMEL is unable to repair an item of TMDE, or  when  an  item  is  condemned  or  designated  as  obsolete.  T.O.  33-1-27,  Appendix  II,  lists obsolete or disposal TMDE items. 13.2.6.1.  When new or replacement TMDE is required, work center TMDE monitors: 13.2.6.1.1.  Determine if substitute items are acceptable. 13.2.6.1.2.  Notify the work center TMDE monitor when TMDE items  are turned in to or received from supply. 13.2.6.1.3.  Coordinate with the work center TO monitor to obtain applicable TOs for new TMDE and to dispose of TOs for TMDE which has been turned in. 13.3.  General Tool Requirements.  Tool kits are defined as all government-purchased tools, to include tools provided by government-paid contractor, utilized to perform Airfield System/radar maintenance  activities  (restore/sustain/maintain  systems).  In  this  publication,  the  term  “tool” refers to all types of tool kits as well as a basic tool (e.g., Xcelite kits, drill, sockets kits, etc.). 13.3.1.  Tool  Definition.  Tools  are  any  physical  or  mobile  device  used  to  maintain  or otherwise examine materials, supplies, equipment, and systems to identify or isolate actual or potential  malfunctions  or  decide  if  they  meet  operational  specifications  established  in technical publications. 13.3.2.  Objectives.  The  objectives  of  the  tool  management  program  are  to  reduce replacement costs through effective control and accountability of assets and minimize unsafe acts. 13.4.  Work Center Tool Management.  This section pertains to the duties and responsibilities at  the  work  center  level  and  applies  to  deployable  tool  kits  as  well  as  home  station  kits. Work centers are responsible for the following: 13.4.1.  Operating  Instruction  (OI)/Management  Procedures.  Create  and  implement  a  local operating instruction published by the unit/work  center addressing the following areas, as a minimum: AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 59 13.4.1.1.  Appointment of a tool custodian and alternate in writing. The unit may appoint a  unit  level  tool  custodian  and  alternate  if  desired  instead  of  individual  work  center custodians. 13.4.1.2.  Procedures addressing effective tool control and accountability. 13.4.1.3.  Procedures addressing tracking/using UTC/mobility tool kits. 13.4.1.4.  Managing  industrial  shop  machinery  tools  and  accessories/attachments  (e.g., Hilti’s, band saws, arbors, chucks, portable vise, blades, Pionjars, etc.) that normally do not fit within the tool kit. 13.4.1.5.  Establishing tool inventory tracking system that facilitates quick inventory and accountability of tools. 13.4.1.6.  Procedures addressing lost, broken or unserviceable tool replacement. 13.4.1.7.  Recurring inspection schedule for all tools and tool kits to ensure serviceability. 13.4.1.8.  Procedures addressing management of tools with warranties and/or guarantees. Refer  to  AFI  33-153,  Information  Technology  (IT)  Asset  Management  (ITAM),  for  IT transactions;  T.O.  00-35D-54-WA-1  and  T.O.  00-20-3-WA-1  for  AFMC-managed systems. 13.4.1.9.  Procedures  addressing  control  and  management  of  replacement,  expendable and consumable hand tools, and other items contained in tool kits or tools (e.g., connector pins, extraction pins, alcohol wipes). 13.4.1.10.  Procedures addressing accountability, control, and use of Electronic Tools (E-Tools). See AFMAN 33-153 for further guidance. 13.4.1.11.  Procedures  addressing  positive  control  of  rags  when  used  in  and  around  the flight line. 13.4.1.12.  Procedures  addressing  management  of  locally  manufactured,  developed  or modified  tools  and  other  support  equipment.  All  locally  manufactured,  developed  or modified  tools  and  equipment  must  be  approved  by  the  commander/designated representative. Examples of these items are test fixtures. This procedure does not apply to local manufacture, modification or design of tools authorized in specific technical data. 13.4.2.  Unit  Type  Code  (UTC)/Mobility  Tool  Kits.  Consider  the  following  items  when establishing procedures for tracking and using UTC/mobility tools kits. 13.4.2.1.  Inspect/inventory  and  document  master  tool  inventory  on  UTC/mobility  tool kits/tools  when  opened,  prior  to  resealing  for  storage  or  at  a  minimum,  quarterly.  If resources do not permit designated UTC/mobility tool kits, garrison kits can be used. 13.4.2.2.  Inventory  and  seal  the  UTC/mobility  tool  kits  to  eliminate  use  while  in garrison. 13.4.2.3.  The  seal  on  the  UTC/mobility  tool  kits  will  show  date  it  was  sealed  and  who completed inventory. 13.4.2.4.  Mark the UTC/mobility toolboxes according to AFI 10-403 (e.g., packing list, etc.). 60 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 13.4.3.  Special Considerations. Consider the following when addressing the management of industrial shop machinery tools and accessories/attachments (e.g., Hiltis, band saws, arbors, chucks, portable vise, blades, Pionjars, etc.) that normally do not fit within the tool kit. 13.4.3.1.  Develop  master  tool  inventory  listing  reflecting  all  industrial  shop  machinery tools  and  accessories/attachments  that  are  not  stored  within  the  tool’s  container. Inventory includes storage location of tool. 13.4.3.2.  If a tool has multiple pieces stored within its container, create an inventory of the contents (i.e., Hiltis drill box contains one drill, two 1/2-inch and one 3/4-inch 6-inch bits, and 3 ounces of lubricating oil). 13.4.4.  Inventory  Tracking  System.  Consider  the  following  when  establishing  a  tool inventory tracking system that facilitates quick inventory and accountability of tools. 13.4.4.1.  Design tool kits to provide a quick inventory and accountability of tools. 13.4.4.2.  Develop a simple inventory method, a “show” (e.g., a shadow of the tool) and “know” (knowledge of tool or kit location) concept. 13.4.4.3.  Establish  tool  kit  contents  for  ease  of  inventory.  Tool  kit  contents  will  be standardized  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  within  functional  areas  within  a  unit  that have similar missions. 13.4.4.4.  Each tool, equipment item or consumable contained in a tool kit that can have an assigned location identified will have one of the following: inlay cuts in the shape of the item, shadowed layout, label, silhouette or drawer/location assignment. No more than one item is stored in a cutout, shadow or silhouette except for tools issued in sets such as drill bits, Allen wrenches, apexes or paired items (e.g., gloves, booties). 13.4.4.5.  Utility  tool  kits  (e.g.,  green  tool  bags,  briefcase  kits,  etc.)  do  not  have assigned/marked individual tool locations within the utility tool kit; however, the master inventory needs to reflect where the utility tool kits are stored when not in use. AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 61 Chapter 14 CORROSION PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAM (CPCP) 14.1.  Introduction.  Corrosion  is  a  natural  phenomenon  that  attacks  metal  by  electrochemical action and converts the metal into a metallic compound, such as an oxide, hydroxide or sulfate. Corrosion occurs because of the tendency for metals to return to their natural state. Corrosion, if left  unchecked,  will  progressively  degrade  an  item’s  strength  until  its  structure  can  no  longer sustain  its  design  load  and/or  cause  malfunctions.  Unchecked  corrosion  can  result  in  excessive maintenance and repair as well as system downtime and product contamination. Everyone needs to  understand  the  corrosion  principles  of  prevention,  detection,  control,  and  minimization  of corrosion impact on the AF’s combat capability. 14.2.  Production Work Center Responsibilities. 14.2.1.  Ensure effective  and timely  equipment  corrosion prevention and control actions are taken  according  to  T.O.  1-1-700-WA-1,  Corrosion  Prevention  and  Control  Ground Communications-Electronic Equipment (C-E); T.O. 31Z-10-37-WA-1, Corrosion Prevention and  Protection;  General  Engineering  Technical  Manual  Corrosion  Prevention  and Protection, applicable technical manual/order, and other command instructions. 14.2.2.  Ensure  all  work  center  technicians  complete  AFJQS  XXXXX-201C,  Corrosion Prevention and Control, and document in training record according to AFI 36-2201. If local tasks  are  required,  ensure  tasks  are  identified,  added  to  the  training  plan,  and  training  is conducted. 14.2.3.  Provide accurate  and timely maintenance and historical  documentation  submissions that address the type, extent, and repair/treatment of corrosion on equipment. 14.2.4.  If  deemed  necessary,  research,  develop,  and  publish  corrosion-control  procedures tailored to work center unique needs or highly corrosion prone areas. Note: It is important to identify  corrosion-prone  areas,  such  as  dissimilar  metals,  fasteners,  hinges,  latches,  rivets, mating surfaces, crevices, faying surface, fillet sealing, spot-wielding assemblies, and water entrapment areas. 14.2.5.  Possess  a  thorough  working  knowledge  of  corrosion-control  policy,  procedures, prevention, identification, and treatment. 14.2.6.  Modify/change  equipment  corrosion-control  PMIs  intervals  to  meet  the  corrosion environment  in  which  the  equipment  will  be  operating.  Some  locations  may  need  to  clean equipment more frequently. 14.2.7.  Ensure  local  work  cards  and  PMIs  for  equipment  contain  clear  corrosion-control inspection  requirements  and  procedures.  Consider  pertinent  factors  including  operational environment, cost, resources, availability, and probability to establish inspection interval. 14.2.8.  Coordinate  with  parent  MAJCOM  Corrosion-Control  Manager  for  guidance  and resolution  of  corrosion  problems  beyond  the  unit’s  capability  to  repair.  See  link  to  find MAJCOM https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af/USAF/ep/browse.do?programId=t6925EC2E5C9A0FB5E044080020E329A9&channelPageId=s6925EC133EFE0FB5E044080020E329A9. Corrosion-Control Managers: 62 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 Chapter 15 HISTORICAL RECORD MANAGEMENT 15.1.  Introduction.  This  chapter  prescribes  general  requirements  and  procedures  for  the administration  of  maintenance  documents,  equipment  inspection,  equipment  transfers,  and equipment historical data. Work center facility, systems installation, and equipment records are historical documentation that constitute a permanent record of significant maintenance actions or significant changes to the facility or system. Historical records must remain with each equipment or system throughout its life cycle. They are designed to provide technicians and item managers with an accurate portrayal of significant actions, modifications, issues, and overhauls. Maintain system/equipment historical files in the work center in a centralized file according to Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, or other applicable directives. Dispose of records in accordance with AFRIMS  RDS,  or  other  applicable  directives.  Electronic  files  are  authorized.  For  classified reporting,  follow  the  approved  AF/MAJCOM  security  classification  guide  for  applicable equipment/system. 15.2.  Overview. 15.2.1.  Master  Inventories.  Units  will  develop  master  inventories  based  on  shipping, acceptance, catalog, and  other applicable documents  for AF, MAJCOM or locally procured COTS/GOTS  equipment  if  an  AFTO  Form  470,  Ground  Communications-Electronic Equipment Electronic Set  Inventory Checklist, has not  been established per T.O. 00-35D-2-WA-1,  Electronic  Set  Inventory  Checklist  for  General  Communication  Electronic  (CE) Equipment. 15.2.2.  Historical Records. Historical records, AFTO Form 95, Significant Historical Data, IMDS  history  files  or  other  records  are  required  on  all  MICAP-reportable  equipment, command-supported  equipment,  and  other  equipment  as  designated  by the  Item Manager/System  Manager/Program  Manager  (IM/SM/PM).  IMs  determine  which  items  in the  MDS-specific  -6  manual  require  historical  reporting,  and  inform  the  SM  so  the equipment/system can be identified for reporting. 15.2.3.  For  ALC-managed  systems/equipment,  AFTO  Forms  95  or  IMDS  history  files  are required  on  all  SRD-coded  systems/equipment  except  for  COMSEC  equipment,  command-supported  equipment,  and  other  equipment  as  designated  by  the  IM/SM/PM.  The  IMs determine on which equipment items specific -6 manual historical reporting is required, and inform the SM so the equipment/systems can be identified for reporting. 15.2.4.  For non-ALC-managed systems/equipment, maintain historical records or equivalent information  utilizing  AFTO  Form  95.  Each  item  does  not  require  its  own  record;  you  may establish  records  based  on  location.  Records  may  be  maintained  in  either  electronic  or manual forms. See paragraph 15.3.4.2. 15.2.5.  All  equipment/systems  tracked  in  IMDS  must  utilize  the  IMDS  history  files  and record  all  significant  maintenance  actions;  especially  Time  Change  Items  (TCI),  Time Compliance Technical  Orders (TCTO), and Time Compliance Network Orders (TCNO).  In addition, all tactical and mobile equipment requires historical records. The records or record duplicates must accompany the equipment when deployed. AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 63 15.2.6.  Historical records must accompany equipment sent to depot for repair/overhaul  and transferred between units. 15.2.7.  For  more  information,  refer  to  T.O.  00-20-1  Chapters  1  through  3.  These  chapters apply to all AF personnel, equipment/systems, and contractors. 15.3.  Work  Center  Responsibilities.

Objective—A  statement  that  specifies  what  behavior  is  to  be  exhibited,  the  conditions  under which  behavior  will  be  accomplished  and  the  minimum  standard  of  performance.  Objectives describe  only  the  behaviors  that  directly  lead  to  or  specifically  satisfy  a  job  performance requirement. An objective is a statement of instructional intent. On-the-Job  Training—Hands-on,  over-the-shoulder  training  conducted  to  certify  personnel  in both upgrade and job qualification training. Also called OJT. Precision Approach Radar (PAR)—Radar displaying range, azimuth, and elevation (in relation to  a  glide  slope)  normally  encompassing  an  area  from  10  to  20  miles  on  final  approach  to  a position on the runway intercepted by the glide slope. Qualified  Personnel—Refers to  those individuals  with  the technical  skills  required to  perform various functions relating to Ground Radar and Airfield equipment/system corrective, inspection, production, and preventive maintenance activities. An individual is considered “qualified” if that individual has been trained to the level necessary to perform specific activities or functions under this technical order. Technical qualifications will vary by function being performed and technical competency required. For example, an individual qualified to troubleshoot a system will require more  specialty/technical  training  than  an  individual  qualified  to  remove  and  install  a  part.  An individual  qualified  to  remove  and  install  a  part  will  require  more  specialty/technical  training than a custodian who conducts operational inspections and assessments. Qualification  Training  Package—An  instructional  package  designed  for  use  at  the  unit  to qualify,  or  aid  qualification,  in  a  duty  position  or  program,  or  a  piece  of  equipment.  It  may  be printed, computer-based, or in other audiovisual media. QTPs do not require third-party. Radar and Tower Coordination System—A radar and tower coordination system (lights serve as  a  reminder  to  the  tower  controller  that  an  arriving  radar  controlled  aircraft  is  in  a  defined location,  or  at  a  prescribed  position).  This  system  may  supplement  or  simplify  the  voice coordination between facilities. It does not replace voice coordination. Radar  Approach  Control  (RAPCON)—A  fixed,  mobile,  or  transportable  radar  facility  that provides approach control, arrival and RFC services using surveillance radar. Recurring  Training—Training  provided  to  periodically  review  selected  current  operational procedures and techniques. Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)—Replaces the term ―unmanned aircraft as an element of the Air  Force‘s  group  4  and  5  UASs  (e.g.,  PREDATOR,  REAPER,  GLOBAL  HAWK  and SENTINEL). Review  Training—Training  conducted  for  the  purpose  of  correcting  or  precluding  specific operational  deficiencies.    Review  training  is  developed  based  on  analysis  of  performance evaluations, supervisory observations, trends, operational evaluations, etc. Skill  Level—The  level  of  qualification  within  an  awarded  Air  Force  specialty,  shown  by  the fourth digit of the Air Force Specialty Code. 82 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 Specialty  Training  Standard—An Air Force publication that describes an Air Force specialty in terms of tasks and knowledge which an airman in that specialty may be expected to perform and  identifies  the  training  provided  to  achieve  a  3-,  5-,  or  7-skill  level  within  an  enlisted  Air Force  specialty.  It  further  serves  as  a  contract  between  Air  Education  and  Training  Command and the functional user to show the overall training requirements for an Air Force specialty code that are taught in formal schools and correspondence schools. Also called STS. Supplemental Training—Training for a portion of an Air Force Specialty without a change in AFSC. Formal training on new equipment, methods and technology that is not suited for on-the- job training. Task—A unit of work activity or operation that forms a significant part of a duty. A task usually has  clear  beginning  and  ending  points  and  directly  observable  or  otherwise  measurable processes,  frequently  but  not  always  resulting  in  a  product  that  can  be  evaluated  for  quantity, quality or fitness in the work environment. A task is performed for its own sake; that is, it is not dependent upon other tasks, although it may fall in a sequence with other tasks in a duty or job array. TMDE/Test  Equipment—Any device used to  maintain, evaluate, measure, calibrate, diagnose or otherwise examine materials, supplies, equipment, and systems to identify or isolate actual or potential malfunction/discrepancies/deficiencies or decide if they meet operational specification established  in  technical  publications.  Some  examples  of  test  equipment  are  fiber  testers,  cable tester, spectrum analyzers, etc. See T.O. 00-20-14-WA-1, for details. War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)—The  pre-stocked  portion  of  the  total  wartime  requirement. WRM  is  materiel  required,  in  addition  to  mobility  equipment  and  peace  time  stock,  to  support wartime activities reflected in the WMP-1, USAF War and Mobilization Plan. WRM represents that  part  of  the  war  requirement  needed  in  addition  to  RSP  and  peace  time  stock  in  order  to sustain wartime operations until industrial production can meet total wartime needs.  AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 83 PERSONNEL EVALUATION REPORT WRITING AND SUBMISSION Attachment 2 A2.1.  Report Writing. A2.1.1.  Determine  Results.  To  determine  overall  results,  evaluators  will  review  notes  and captured  examples,  then  validate  references.  Results  are  based  on  overall  process performance. Evaluators must: A2.1.1.1.  Document  all  evaluation  task  deficiencies  including  Corrected  During Evaluation (CDE) corrections. A2.1.1.2.  Grading  Criteria.  All  deficiencies  are  tracked  for  trend  analysis  using standardized  codes  to  include  CDEs.  The  decision  to  document  a  deficiency  must  be based  on  published  standard  practices  and  procedures,  technical  data,  and  other  policy guidance. A2.1.1.3.  All validated deficiencies will include a deficiency code and a category rating of either critical (Cat I), major (Cat II); or minor (Cat III) based on Table A2.1. A2.1.1.4.  Rate  each  task  included  in  the  overall  evaluation.  All  deficiencies  are  then totaled and assigned an overall task result according to Table A2.2, Personnel Evaluation Task  Result  Matrix.  Results  are  based  on  the  following  three-grade  system:  In Compliance  (C);  Complies  With  Comments  (CWC),  or  Not  In  Compliance  (NIC),  per Table A2.2. Technicians will be decertified on task(s) rated NIC. A2.1.1.5.  Examples of Deficiencies. Table A2.1 shows what deficiency code may apply to a certain situation. A2.1.1.6.  Examples  of  Task  Results.  Table  A2.2  shows  how  to  determine  the  results based on the deficiency codes results for each task evaluated. A2.1.1.6.1.  If  a  technician  sets  up  an  oscilloscope  that  is  overdue  calibration  and does not use it, document this mistake as a Category III. A2.1.1.6.2.  If  the  technician  sets  up  an  oscilloscope  that  is  overdue  calibration  and uses  the  oscilloscope  during  the  evaluation  to  make  measurements  according  to specifications  outlined  within  a  technical  order  or  technical  guidance,  then  the evaluator documents the mistake as a Cat I or II deficiency depending on how serious the  impact  might  be  on  system  or  equipment  capability  by  using  potentially  out-of-tolerance test equipment. Based on the evaluator’s assessment using Table A2.1 and Table A2.2, the task result would be either a CWC or a not in compliance (NIC) for that task. A NIC would require the member be decertified on the task and reevaluated. A  CWC  result  allows  the  supervisor  based  on  the  evaluator  recommendation  to determine if the member requires task decertification. Note:  Table A2.1 provides an objective  method  to  evaluate  errors.  Nevertheless,  the  evaluator’s  experience  and subjective judgment will play a part in the assessment. A2.1.1.7.  Personnel  evaluations  that  contain  no  (zero)  NIC  tasks  are  rated  as “Satisfactory.”  Evaluations  that  contain  one  or  more  NIC  tasks  are  rated  as “Unsatisfactory.” 84 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 A2.1.1.8.  Brief  the  evaluatee  and  the  work  center  supervisor  upon  determining  the evaluation resulted in one or more NIC task ratings. Note: An evaluation that resulted in one or more NIC-rated tasks requires an investigation to determine the root cause of the identified deficiencies for each NIC task, and initiation of the decertification process on those respective tasks. See AFI 36-2201, for more details. A2.1.1.9.  Develop  an  executive  summary  that  contains  a  summary  of  what  was evaluated,  the  overall  result  (satisfactory  or  unsatisfactory),  a  comment  about  the technician’s  performance,  strengths  and  weaknesses,  and  a  deficiency  trend  analysis  to include root causes and recommended management actions to prevent recurrence.

Antenna Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI)/Inspection Policy.  Proper antenna inspections  and  maintenance/support  are  essential  to  effective  management  of  AF  command, control,  and  communications.  Annual  antenna  PMIs  consist  of  Voltage  Standing  Wave  Ratio (VSWR)  and  visual/physical  inspection  of  antennas/associated  cabling.  Annual  PMIs  will  be completed IAW governing publications to include: T.O. 31R-10-5, Air Force Comm Commands (E-I  Standards)  -  Antenna  Systems,  Maint,  Repair  and  Testing,  T.O.  31-10-21,  Installation Practices:  AF  Communications  Service  (E-I_  Standard)  Antenna  System  Protection,  Stepping, and  Splicing  of  Poles,  T.O.  31-20-24,  T.O.  31W3-10-19,  AF  Communications  Service  (E-I Standard) - Standard Instl Practices, Telephone, Outside Plant Instl, Pole Line, AFMSI 300-1, and applicable commercial manuals. Annual PMIs will be conducted by any qualified technician regardless of AFSC. Units without the capability or technical experience to perform annual PMIs will submit an AFTO Form 229, Engineering Installation Assistance Request, IAW T.O. 00-25-108-WA-1 and T.O. 00-33D-2002-WA-1. Forward all AFTO 229s to owning MAJCOM POC. A3.2.  Antenna  PMI  Intervals.  Unless  specified  otherwise,  antenna  PMIs  will  be  performed annually  according  to  applicable  technical  manuals  and  manufacturer’s  manual.  PMIs  will  be loaded in IMDS IAW Chapter 3. PMI deviation requests will be sent to the owning MAJCOM POC coordination. A3.3.  Inventory  Listings.  Load  and  maintain  inventory  listings  for  all  antenna  systems  in IMDS in accordance with individual antenna T.O., T.O. 00-20-2, and AFCSM 21-556, Volume 2, Introduction to Information Management Distribution System Central Database (IMDS CDB). A3.4.  Leadership Notification.  Notify the commander/superintendent or applicable leadership of any issues that degrade antenna support for communications services.  88 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 Attachment 4 SAMPLING PLAN A4.1.  Common Terms. A4.1.1.  Population. The number of like items assigned to a work center will be used as the population for equipment evaluations. A4.1.2.  Like  Items.  Like  items  perform  the  same  basic  function;  are  of  the  same  basic design; and are maintained using the same basic tests and alignments. A4.1.3.  Sample Size. Sample size is the number of items that need to be sampled. A4.2.  Using  a  Sampling  Plan  For  Equipment  Evaluations.  Count  the  amount  of  like  items and find the corresponding block under the column titled population size in Table A4.1, Sample Sizes. The corresponding sample size in the sample size column is the minimum number of like items  to  be  inspected.  For  example,  the  unit  has  25  A-Widgets  and  30  B-Widgets  which  are considered like equipment end items. The total is 55; therefore, the sample size is 19 items. Nine (9) A-Widgets and ten (10) B-Widgets would be inspected over the 18-month timeframe. Table A4.1. Sample Sizes.  Population Size 1 2 through 5 6 through 10 11 through 15 16 through 25 26 through 50 51 through 75 76 through 100 101 through 150 151 through 200 201 through 250 251 through 300 301 through 350 351 through 500 501 through 1000 1001-plus  Sample Size 1 2 3 4 6 13 19 20 30 40 50 60 70 100 200 25 percent of total A4.3.  Random Sampling.  For other large quantities of materials that need to be sampled, use a sampling  size  of  25  percent.  This  sampling  rate  can  be  useful  to  inspect  any  large  population commodity,  such  as  technical  order  files,  publication  files,  bench  stock  bins,  etc.  Rather  than inspect  100  percent  of  a  file/commodity,  evaluation  of  an  appropriate  sample  size  normally provides a reliable indication of the condition of the total file. This is the minimum required and units  can  increase  this  sample  size  depending  on  the  deficiencies  noted.  For  example,  you  are performing  a  self-assessment  on  training.  You  determine  you  have  145  training  records consisting of the following:  60 3-levels,  70 5-levels  and  15 7-levels.  You can either sample 25 percent  of  the  145  total  (approx.  36)  or  25  percent  of  each  sub  category  so  15  3-levels,  18  5-AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 89 levels,  and  4  7-levels  with  a  total  of  37  records.  The  latter  provides  a  more  comprehensive review and ensures you evaluate on skill levels. A4.4.  Use  of  a  Random  Number  Table.  To  effectively  evaluate  a  random  sample  of commodity, you can use a random number generator to identify which item in the commodity to evaluate. To determine the specific items or records to be evaluated, develop a way to randomly identify the items. For example: enter the list of items to be evaluated into an Excel spreadsheet. After  determining  how  many  need  to  be  inspected  by  multiplying  the  total  by  0.25,  use  a sequence generator to help provide the number of an item to be sampled. If you have 16 items, four items need to be sampled, and the sequence generator responds with 3, 5, 13, and 15 or you pull the corresponding number from a hat. Those items corresponding to those numbers are to be sampled. They  were  randomly selected to be  evaluated. There are  random  sequence  generators available via the Internet.  90 AFI13-204V4  18 JANUARY 2017 Attachment 5 AIR FORCE MAINTENANCE QUALITY CONTROL CHECKLIST (AFMQCC) A5.1.  Obtaining AFMQCCs.
