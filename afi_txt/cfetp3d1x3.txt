The changing Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) and Air and Space Expeditionary Forces (AEF) environments require vision, preparation, and attention to ensure people have the right skills and tools to deliver the C4I capabilities and the support required by the war fighter in meeting the Air Force mission of today and the vision of the future.  Declining resources, expanding diversity of mission, and ever-changing technologies in the Air Force are impacting the availability of our most valuable resource--people.  These factors will continue to exist in the future, making it essential for the work force to be effectively and efficiently trained to perform duties within each skill level of an Air Force Specialty (AFS).  To meet the challenges of tomorrow, the Air Force must place a greater emphasis on career field training.  This RF Transmission Systems Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP) is a comprehensive core training document that identifies life-cycle training/education requirements, support resources, and minimum core task requirements for the 3D1X3 specialty.  The plan is a "training road map" for the career field.  It provides personnel a clear career path to success and makes career field training identifiable, measurable, and budget defensible. 2.  IMPORTANT:  This CFETP is not a stand-alone document.  It must be used in conjunction with the 3DXXX Cyberspace Support (Common Core) CFETP, which outlines tasks and courses shared by other 3D specialties.  Together, the 3DXXX and 3D1X3 CFETPs provide comprehensive career field guidance and training for members of the AFSC 3D1X3. 3.  The CFETP documents the career field training program and consists of two parts.  Management uses both parts in conjunction with the Training Business Area (TBA) to plan, manage, and control training within the career field.  NOTE:  Civilians occupying associated positions will use Part II to support duty position qualification training. 3.1.  Part I provides information necessary for overall management of the specialty.  Section A explains how everyone will use the plan; Section B identifies career field progression information, duties and responsibilities, training strategies, and career field path; Section C associates each level with specialty qualifications (knowledge, education, experience, training, and other); and Section D indicates resource constraints.  Some examples are funds, manpower, equipment, facilities; Section E identifies transition training guide requirements for SSgt through MSgt. 3.2.  Part II includes the following: Section A identifies the Specialty Training Standard (STS) and includes duties, tasks, Training References (TRs) to support training, AETC conducted training, wartime course and core task and correspondence course requirements.  Section B contains the Course Objectives List (COL) and training standards supervisors will use to determine if Airmen satisfied training requirements; Section C identifies available support materials (e.g., Qualification Training Package, which may be developed to support proficiency training); Section D identifies a training course index supervisors can use to determine resources available to support training.  Included here are both mandatory and optional courses; and Section E identifies MAJCOM-unique training requirements supervisors can use to determine 4  additional training required for the associated qualification needs.  At unit level, supervisors and trainers will use Part II to identify, plan and conduct training commensurate with the overall goals of this plan. 4.  Use of the guidance provided in this CFETP provides the foundation for effective and efficient training for individuals in this career field at the appropriate points in their careers.  This plan enables the Air Force to train today's work force for tomorrow's jobs. 5   Abbreviations/Terms Explained This section provides a common understanding of the terms that apply to the RF Transmission Systems Career Field and Education Training Plan.

In response to a wartime scenario, these tasks will be taught in the 3-level course in a streamlined training environment.  These tasks are only for those career fields that still need them applied to their schoolhouse tasks. Workflow.  A series of steps necessary for the initiation, tracking, and delivery of services or outputs with the capability to cut across existing or future organizational boundaries.  Furthermore, web-based workflow products allow electronic coordination, staffing, and task management of documents and files.  They are relational to an electronic version of the Staff Summary Sheet (SSS) and other AF/DoD forms used for routing/collection of information.  14  Automation provides the capability to suspense and track correspondence through the workflow process and provides action officers and document originators status on their packages.  Provides users the capabilities to comply with structured electronic workflow processes and the flexibility to create/develop ad hoc workflow courses of actions.  Future use of standardized EIM tools will enhance usability and eliminate legacy methods.   15   Section A - General Information 1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP, when used in conjunction with the 3DXXX Cyberspace Support CFETP provides the information necessary for AFCFMs, MAJCOM Functional Managers (MFM), commanders, training managers, supervisors, and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  The plan outlines the initial skills, upgrade, qualification, advanced, and proficiency training those individuals in AFSC 3D1X3 should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their careers.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the AF or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is provided by the 338th Training Squadron (TRS) at Keesler AFB, MS.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, Career Development Course (CDC) completion, and correspondence courses required for award of the 5-, 7-, or 9-skill level. Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to qualify an airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or on-the-job training provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes, some of which are: 1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training program.  Also, ensures that established training is provided at the appropriate point in an individual's career. 1.2.  Identifies task and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual’s career. 1.3.  Lists training courses available in the specialty, identifies sources of training, and the training medium. 1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints that impact implementation of the desired career field training program. 2.  Use of the CFETP.  The CFETP is maintained by the 3D1XX Air Force Career Field Manager (AFCFM), SAF/CIO A6SF.  MAJCOM FMs and AETC review the plan annually to ensure currency and accuracy and forward recommended changes to the AFCFM.

AFJQS items set the standard for qualification and certification and are mandatory for use in conjunction with this STS when applicable to the duty position. NOTE 3:  All objectives are trained during wartime. NOTE 4:  Commanders, supervisors and trainers will use TBA to track and manage training for all 3DXXX personnel. NOTE 5:  When an AFJQS is loaded into TBA, AFJQS task numbering will vary from the STS.  The numbering scheme is defined by your work center specific master training plan. NOTE 6:  Third person certification is not required for all Cyber Support Specialist personnel.  However, members (to include civilians and contractors) assigned to crew positions are still required position certification in accordance with Stan/Eval procedures. NOTE 7:  In the event of data network or computer system failure, courses are authorized to use alternative methods of instruction to fulfill this STS element. NOTE 8:  Unless otherwise stated in the objective, the student may be allowed two assists from the instructor and still successfully achieve the proper level of proficiency.  An instructor assist is defined as anytime an instructor must intercede to provide guidance to a student which leads to a satisfactory completion of the objective or to prevent a student from continuing in a manner which will lead to an unsatisfactory conclusion, safety violation, or damage to the equipment.  Successful students have performed the task to the satisfaction of the course; however, they may not be capable of meeting the field requirements for speed or accuracy. NOTE 9:  All equipment related objectives are performed by following procedures from technical orders, technical manuals, or student instructional material developed by the training facility. NOTE 10:  Senior NCO’s in the 3DXXX AFSCs are not required to have an Individual Training Plan (ITP) with the following exceptions: personnel in upgrade training status, or performing equipment maintenance as part of primary duties.

Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a performance progress check and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a progress check. 5.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 6.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the student can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step by step procedures for doing the task. Section C - Support Materials 7.
