For  enlisted  personnel,  nominees  should  not  have  been  accepted  for  a commissioning program for the same eligibility period. 3.2.7.  Nominees  will  not  use  accomplishments  from  time  assigned  to  a  formal  training program such as AFIT, fellowships, internships, or while in student status. 3.2.8.  Colonels  and  CMSgts  will  generally  be  considered  ineligible  for  AFMS-level awards  unless  a  component  of  a  team  award  or  otherwise  specified  in  the  ensuing attachments. 3.2.9.  Contractors will be considered ineligible for the AFMSAP. 3.3.  Individual and team award nominations are locally drafted and approved initially at the unit-level.  MAJCOMs  solicit  nominations  each  year  for  MAJCOM-level  awards  and  also determine  nominations  for  AF-level  awards.  If  no  award  category  exists  at  the  MAJCOM level,  unit-level  award  nomination  packages  should  be  submitted  through  their  respective MAJCOM  or  equivalent  headquarters  prior  to  submission  to  the  award  OPR,  unless otherwise stated. 3.3.1.  MAJCOM  or  equivalent  level  nominees  are  defined  as  nominees  to  an  AF-level (SG)  award  and  are  not  MAJCOM  or  equivalent  level  winners  of  the  AF-level  (SG) award, and they will be referred to appropriately on performance reports. 3.4.

A  single  letter  illustrating  all  individual  nominees  and  teams  signed  by  the Medical  Group  Commander  or  equivalent.  This  letter  is  for  MAJCOM  screening purposes, and need not be submitted by the MAJCOM to the award OPR. A MAJCOM may  choose  to  alter  these  requirements,  but  group-level  or  equivalent  commander  must acknowledge  each  applicant  from  his  or  her  command.  The  letter  should  include  an attachment  listing  all  nominees  being  submitted  for  any  award  and  will  include  the nominees’ full names and ranks. Team awards will be submitted as a separate attachment listing  all  team  members.  It  too  should  include  the  nominees’  full  names  and  ranks. Sample  nomination  packages  are  available  in  Attachment  3  through  Attachment  6. Members with  UIFs or quality force issues are not eligible to compete for individual or team awards. If such a member’s team is nominated, the team may still compete for the award. However, the member in question must be omitted from the list of team members nominated.  MAJCOM  award  processes  may  take  precedence  over  these  nomination package requirements. 3.4.2.1.  Nominees  are  eligible  for  rank-specific  awards  if  the  nominee’s  rank matched  the  rank  specified  for  at  least  six  months  of  the  eligibility  period.  For example, SSgt Jones is eligible for the Outstanding Medical  Materiel  Airman of the   6  AFI36-2856  22 OCTOBER 2012 Year Award if he or she served in the rank of SrA for six months or more during the eligibility period. 3.4.2.2.  Individuals  who  undergo  a  permanent  change  of  station  (PCS)  during  the eligibility period should be submitted for awards (individual and team) by the unit to which  they  are/were  assigned  at  the  time  of  nomination.  Accomplishments  from  a previous base are acceptable for individual awards in these cases. Individuals should not  be  submitted  for  individual  awards  by  a  deployed  unit;  however  deployed  units may forward the member’s information to the unit of assignment for submission and coordination. Deployed units are not eligible for team awards. 3.5.  Written narratives for individual and team nominations will meet the criteria outlined in Attachment  5  and  Attachment  6  unless  otherwise  specified  within  the  award-specific attachment. Any acronym or similar legends should be identified and spelled out on the front side  of  AF  Form  1206  below  the  content  related  bullets  under  the  heading:  ACRONYM LIST. Acronyms are listed in alphabetical order.  List acronyms vertically; if the list exceeds one column in length, list horizontally.  See Attachment 5 and Attachment 6 for examples. 3.5.1.

Also  illustrate  any  other  team  accomplishments  that  demonstrate integration  and  collegiality,  and  significant  contribution  to  increase  mission effectiveness, e.g., any AFSO21 initiatives. 3.6.  MAJCOM Responsibilities. 3.6.1.  Establish suspense dates and guidelines for nominations. 3.6.1.1.  MAJCOMs  should  use  command  functionals,  AFMOA  SMEs,  and  other strategic  leaders  to  select  winners  through  the  board  process.  Consider  having AF/SG2  and  Chief,  Medical  Enlisted  Force  as  the  OPRs  for  selecting  board president/membership at the MAJCOM level. 3.6.2.

Awards  packages  are  due  to  appropriate  award  OPR  NLT  1  December. MAJCOMs may create their own suspense’s to meet the suspense to the award OPR. Any MAJCOM suspense mentioned is merely a suggestion. Individuals not assigned to a MAJCOM, FOA or DRU may submit their packages directly to the award OPR by the suspense of 1 December. 3.6.4.  Each MAJCOM, FOA or DRU submits one nomination from each award category annually.  In  such  instances  where  submitting  a  nomination  in  a  given  category  is  not desired,  the  winner  may  be  recognized  at  the  respective  MAJCOM,  FOA  or  DRU,  but does not have to be forwarded for AF-level competition. 3.6.5.  If  no  nominations  are  to  be  forwarded,  a  negative  reply  to  the  award  OPR  is required. 3.7.  Individual  members  may  be  nominated  for  only  one  individual  AFMS-level  award  in any given eligibility period.   8  AFI36-2856  22 OCTOBER 2012 3.7.1.  Military nominees are limited to winning a specific AFMS-level award to no more than once in their career within the same category (e.g., limit to once at CGO level and once at FGO level). Individuals may, however, apply and/or compete for other AF-level awards  without  this  particular  restriction.    Civilian  nominees  are  limited  to  winning  a specific  individual  AFMS-level  award  to  once  every  five  years  for  the  same  award category unless otherwise annotated in the award criteria. 3.7.1.1.  Because team members turn over on a regular basis, a team that wins at the AFMS-level may re-compete for the same award, without restriction. 3.7.2.  A  MAJCOM  nominee,  who  does  not  win  at  the  Air  Force  level,  may  compete again in the same category without restriction unless otherwise stated by the MAJCOM. 4.  Selecting USAF Award Winners. 4.1.  Selection Board Dates. 4.1.1.  The  Award  OPR  will  convene  a  selection  board  and  select  winners  NLT  first business day following 1 January. 4.2.

Exceptions can be made, providing that the board presidents are equal, or senior to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel  for  officer  awards  or  SMSgt  for  enlisted  awards.  Members  must  be  higher  or equivalent to those who are able to compete for the same award category. 4.3.  Submission Dates. 4.3.1.  The award OPR ensures that information regarding award winners is submitted to AF/SG1 NLT 15 January. Required information for each winner includes name of award, full  name  (list  of  names  if  team  award),  rank,  unit,  installation,  installation  mailing address, and MAJCOM/FOA/DRU. 5.

In addition  to  an official worldwide message (all MAJCOM/DRU/FOA), AF/SG1 will ensure each MAJCOM/DRU/FOA is provided with an electronic list of the annual winners. This  is  intended  to  facilitate  expeditious  recognition  of  the  AFMS  winner(s)  within  each MAJCOM/DRU/FOA. 6.  Presenting the Awards and Recognition: 6.1.  AFMS-level  individual  award  winners  will  receive  a  personal  letter  and  certificate  of recognition  signed  by  the  Air  Force  Surgeon  General  and  are  authorized  to  wear  the  Air Force  Recognition  Ribbon  (military)  or  the  Air  Force  Recognition  Lapel  Pin  (civilian),  as applicable.

The  Air  Force  Recognition  Ribbon  is  not authorized for members of winning teams. 6.2.  AF/SG1  will  generate  letters  and  certificates  as  noted  in  Section  6.1  and  will  forward them to the appropriate MAJCOM/FOA/DRU for subsequent distribution to the unit-level. 6.3.  In  addition  to  the  recognition  provided  by  the  AF/SG  and/or  the  MAJCOM/SG, functional  representatives  may  elect  to  offer  supplemental  recognition  at  an  appropriate time/location. 6.4.
