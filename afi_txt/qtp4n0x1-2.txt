These Qualification Training Packages (QTPs) were developed to enhance on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. As a trainer, the QTPs provide you with the breakdown of tasks into teachable elements. The teachable elements will help you to guide the trainee toward sufficient proficiency for task performance without assistance. QTPs are also used by the task certifiers/certification official to evaluate trainees concerning tasks which need third-party certification.  2.  Review each volume and identify which modules of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position. Core task items are identified with the number “5” on the STS Column 2; these items are the minimum mandatory skills which are required for all 4N0X1 personnel to be proficient in performing. You have the flexibility to arrange training for each module in the order that you decide.  3.  Review the subject-area tasks in each module with the trainee. Direct the trainee to review the training references to gain a better understanding of the objective for each module. If the trainee has any questions about the objective, clarify the behavior that is expected in the objective. Review the performance checklist with the trainee, and allow him/her sufficient time to learn each step (some objectives may take longer to teach). Remember--the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and to allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task without assistance.  4.  When the trainee receives sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on an objective, follow the evaluation instructions. The performance checklist must be used as you evaluate each task objective. When the trainee successfully accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in AFTR.  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated on AF Form 1098, Special Task Certification and Recurring Training, filed in Part 3, Section B in AFTR. NOTE: The individual checklists are not filed in each member’s AFTR. A master checklist is filed in Part 3, Section B of the hardcopy Master Training Plan (MTP) folder.  6. concerning each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in AFTR. As the trainer, when you are satisfied that the trainee is qualified to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.  7. trainer first must ensure that the trainee is qualified to perform the task without assistance. Then the trainee will be evaluated by a task certifier/certifying official. The tasks which require third-party certification are denoted with a “^” in Column 3E of the Career Field Education and Training Plan (CFETP). After third-party certification, training qualification is documented appropriately in AFTR.  8.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing refresher/sustainment training. Such standardization will benefit the CFETP training concept throughout each member’s career. These documents also will be utilized for assessing/certifying the Aerospace Medical Service Specialist each time that he/she is assigned to a new duty position. The QTP developers’ goal is to publish a usable document for certifying officials, trainers, and trainees for the purpose of enhancing on-the-job training for Aerospace Medical Service Specialty personnel. We value your first-hand expertise, and we encourage your feedback. Direct all inquiries to:  If the trainee does not accomplish the objective, review the areas which need remediation. Conduct a feedback If the task which is being trained requires third-party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the  383d TRAINING SQUADRON/TRR c/o 4N0X1 CDC WRITER/MANAGER 2931 Harney Rd, BLDG 903  Fort Sam Houston, TX 78234 DSN: 420-5126       3 Volume 2                                                                                                 Module 1  ASSIST WITH CENTRAL VENOUS LINE  INSERTION AND MONITORING  SUBJECT AREA: Medical Examinations/Special Procedures--Cardiovascular Procedures  TASK(s): Assist with central venous line insertion  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(s):  2.13.9.5.

Verify physician’s order. 2. Identify patient using 2 identifiers, explain procedure. 3. Gather supplies.  4. Perform hand hygiene, don gloves, eye protection, mask. PERFORMANCE ITEM 5. Irrigate, cleanse, debride the wound/site as necessary. 6. Assess the 7 P’s. a.  Pain b. Pulses c. Pallor (i.e., color, temperature, and moisture of skin) d.  Paralysis (i.e., motor function) e. Paresthesia (i.e., sensory function) f.  Pressure (i.e., tenseness, as in compartment syndrome) g. Puffiness (i.e., swelling, edema)  7. Determine the appropriate type and route of anesthetic agent. 8. Apply the six rights of medication safety:  medication, dose, time, route, patient, documentation. 9. Assess patient’s sensory awareness before administering anesthetic. APPLYING A TOPICAL ANESTHETIC AGENT EMLA 1. Apply a thick layer (1 to 2 gm/10 cm2) of EMLA to intact skin and cover with an occlusive dressing for approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour before procedure. 2. When more painful procedures, apply 2 gm of EMLA per 10 cm2 for at least 2 hours.  3. Assess patient’s sensory awareness after administering anesthetic. LIDOCAINE 1. Apply lidocaine topically as a liquid, ointment, jelly, or viscous fluid (2% to 10%). 2. The maximum safe dose for adults is 250 to 300 mg. Do not exceed the recommended dose, because total absorption is rapid and cannot be calculated. 3. Assess patient’s sensory awareness after administering anesthetic. BENZOCAINE AND TETRACAINE 1. Use sprays containing benzocaine and tetracaine (Cetacaine, Hurricaine) for oral procedures. 2.  Spray application should not exceed 2 seconds. 3. If anesthetizing the nose, mouth, or pharynx, instruct the patient to remain n.p.o. for 1 hour.  15                                                       Topical anesthesia of the nose, mouth, or pharynx may create an inadvertent suppression of the gag reflex, which may cause aspiration when combined with difficulty in swallowing. 4. Assess patient’s sensory awareness after administering anesthetic. LET (LIDOCAINE 4% Epinephrine 0.1% Tetracaine 0.5%) 1. Use LET primarily for minor facial and scalp lacerations in lieu of injectable anesthetic, especially in children. Because it contains epinephrine, LET should not be used on mucous membranes, the nose, the pinnae of the ears, the fingers, the toes, or the penis. 2. Apply LET by saturating sterile gauze and applying it to the wound with firm pressure for 15 to 20 minutes. LET may also be applied by dripping it into a wound with a syringe or by applying it to a wound with sterile cotton swabs. In gel form, LET is spread directly into the wound. A gel or solution-soaked gauze may be held in place with a clear bio-occlusive dressing or elastic bandage. 3. Ensure LET does not run or drip into the eyes, nasal passages, or mouth.  Observe the patient carefully during and after administration. 4. If the first dose of LET is not effective, infiltrate the laceration with a local anesthetic; do not repeat a dose of LET. 5. Assess patient’s sensory awareness after administering anesthetic. PERFORM LOCAL INFILTRATION 1. Use appropriate techniques to decrease the patient’s pain during wound infiltration.  Options include but are not limited to the following.  ALWAYS follow the physician’s orders.       a. Use buffered lidocaine, which may reduce pain with injection. Lidocaine is buffered by adding 1 ml of sodium bicarbonate (8.4%) to every 10 ml of lidocaine solution. It remains effective after mixing for 1 week. b. Using a longer-acting local anesthetic (e.g., bupivacaine), which may prevent the wound from having to be re-infiltrated.  Lidocaine has a more rapid onset, but it has a short duration of action. If prolonged post anesthesia pain is anticipated, bupivacaine is useful. c. Use appropriate size needle for infiltration.  d. Slowly administer anesthetic intradermally through the inside margins of wound edges and not through the skin. As the needle passes through the dermis, continue injecting.  e. Reentering through areas already infiltrated with anesthetic to lessen the pain of infiltration when additional needle entry is needed, multiple injections may be necessary to ensure maximum anesthetic effect.   2. Assess patient’s sensory awareness after administering anesthetic. 3. Discard supplies IAW local policy, perform hand hygiene, and document the procedure in the patient’s medical record.      16                                      PERFORM DIGITAL BLOCK 1. Assess CSM distal to the wound before and after administering anesthetic. a. Assess vascular status by noting the capillary refill response at the distal end of the affected digit. b. Evaluate sensation, using closed hemostats; sharp vs pressure. c. Assess mobility by testing grip, opposition of thumb and finger.   2. Determine anesthetic of choice.  The amount required varies with each patient. For adults, an effective block can be accomplished with 3 to 4 ml in the digits, 4 to 5 ml in the thumb, and 4 to 6 ml in the great toe. 3. Position the needle adjacent to the nerve. The patient may complain of tingling or feeling a shock if the nerve is touched. Reposition the needle to avoid nerve injury. 4. Attempt to aspirate to avoid injecting into blood vessels that are adjacent to digital nerves. 5. Insert the needle down to the periosteum and infiltrate close to the bone.  6. Administer separate injections on either side of the digit as indicated. 7. After infiltration of local anesthetic, gently massage the tissue. 8. Assess patient’s sensory awareness after administering anesthetic. 9. Discard supplies IAW local policy, perform hand hygiene and document the procedure in the patient’s medical record.

Cleaned the bridge of the patient's nose with soap and water or an alcohol swab. 7. Instruct the patient to relax and breathe normally while occluding one nostril. Select the nostril with greater airflow, if bilateral airflow was equal, asked for patient preference. 8. Estimate the length of tube to be inserted.  Measure the distance from the tip of the nose to the earlobe, then to the xiphoid process and mark with a piece of tape. 9.  Lubricate 7.5 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) of the end of the tube with water-soluble lubricating gel.                                                               a. b. and allow the patient to relax, provide tissues if necessary. Once past the nasopharynx, stop tube advancement, (unless the patient prefers to avoid delay) 10.  Alert the patient when the procedure is about to begin. 11. Instruct the patient to extend the neck back against a pillow; insert the NG tube gently through the naris at an angle parallel to the floor of the nasal canal, not upright.  12.  Continue to pass the tube along the floor of the nasal passage, aiming down toward the patient's ear. If resistance is felt, apply gentle downward pressure to advance the tube. 13. If resistance continues, try to rotate and then advanced the tube. If resistance persists, withdraw the tube, allow the patient to rest, lubricate the tube again, and insert the tube into the other naris. Do not force past resistance. 14. Continue inserting the tube until it is just past the nasopharynx by gently rotating the tube toward the opposite naris.       15.  Instruct the patient to flex his or her head forward and take a small sip of water (if safe and the  patient is able to cooperate), and swallow. Advanced the tube with swallowing. If the patient is not allowed fluids, instruct the patient to dry swallow and advanced the tube during the swallowing motion. If the patient is unable to cooperate with swallowing motions, watch for signs (e.g., cough or other discomfort) that the tube is entering the trachea. 16. If the patient begins to cough, gag, or choke, stop advancement and withdraw the tube to the nasopharyngeal area. Instruct the patient to breathe easily and take sips of water if able to swallow.  If vomiting occurs, assist the patient to clear his or her airway, suctioning as needed. If gagging and coughing continue or the patient complain that the tube feels as though it is coiling in the throat, check the back of the oropharynx using a pen light and tongue blade. Withdraw any coiled tube until the tip is in the oropharynx again and reinserted as the patient swallowed. not contraindicated, and the patient prefers to sip water to facilitate insertion, had water available for the next step. Explain to the patient that swallowing may facilitate tube advancement. If drinking water is  24 17.  After the patient relaxes, continue to advance the tube while the patient swallows. Advancing until reaching the tape on the tube signifying that the tube is inserted the desired distance. Anchor the tube to the patient’s cheek with tape until tube placement was verified. 18.  Verify NG Tube Placement by instilling 20 to 30 ml of air into the tube with a large syringe and auscultating the upper left abdominal quadrant for sound of air bolus, and/or attaching a syringe to the end of the tube and aspirating gastric contents observing color, volume and checking with pH indicator strips.  A chest x-ray should be considered prior to instilling fluid or medications. a.  Tape the tube to the patient's nose in a way that avoids placing pressure on  the internal or external aspect of the naris. Apply prepared tape to the nose, leaving split ends free. Be sure the tape over the nose is secure. Carefully wrap two split ends of tape around the tube. NG tubes can be inadvertently removed; ensure that the tube is well secured and as innocuous as possible. b.  Apply a tube securement device using adhesive patch. c.  Small, soft NG tubes may be fastened to the cheek with transparent   dressings from the tube exit site and across the cheek instead of tape to naris if adequate securement can be obtained in this manner. If this is not possible, try securing the tube to the cheek after securing to the naris. Apply tincture of benzoin or skin preparation agent to the cheek and wait until it is dry and tacky before placing a securement device to help keep the dressing in place.  19. Don new gloves if needed and secure the NG tube to the patient. 20.  Ensure the tube is capped or clamped or connected to drainage. 21.

Verify physician’s order. 2. Identify patient using 2 identifiers, and explain procedure  3. Gather supplies.  4. Perform hand hygiene and don gloves. 5. Raise the bed to an appropriate working height. Facing the patient, stand on the left side of the bed if right-handed and on the right side if left-handed. If side rails are in use, raise the side rail on the opposite side of the bed and lower the side rail on the working side. 6. Assist the patient to a supine position.  a. Males: Supine with legs extended. b. Females: Supine with knees bent and apart 7. Place a waterproof pad under the patient. 8. Drape the patient only exposing the genitalia. 9.  Clean the perineal area with soap and water as needed and dry. 10.  Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene. 11. Open the catheter kit; place inner wrapped box on easily accessible, clean bed side table or set it between the patient’s legs. 12.  Open the sterile wrap covering the box containing catheter supplies. Use sterile technique, and fold back each flap of the sterile package one at a time, with the last flap opened toward the nurse/tech. 13. Don Sterile gloves. 14. Apply sterile fenestrated drape over patient’s genitalia creating a sterile field. 15.  Prepare items for catheter insertion.   a. Checked for a secure connection at the tubing and catheter connection site. b. test catheter balloon by injecting fluid from prefilled sterile water syringe into the balloon port (follow manufacturer’s instructions)  16. Loosen the lid on the sterile specimen container if a urine specimen was required.   17. Open the package of sterile antiseptic solution and pour the solution over sterile cotton balls. If the kit contained sterile antiseptic swabs instead of solution, opened the package with "stick" ends up for access. 18. Open the packet containing lubricant, and squeeze the lubricant onto the sterile field. If the lubricant is provided in a prefilled syringe, remove the protective cap and spread lubricant into the sterile tray. 19.  Place the catheter tip into the lubricant. 20.  Using non dominant hand gently spread the urethral meatus so the opening is visible.   28 a. Males:  Retract foreskin if necessary, raise penis to a 90 degree angle, and insert catheter approximately 6-10 inches until urine return is noted. b. Females:  Insert catheter approximately 2-3 inches until urine flow is noted. Note:  Remove no more the 750-1000 ml of urine at any one time  21.  Using dominant hand cleanse urethral meatus. 22. Use sterile dominant hand to pick up the catheter, hold the distal end of the catheter loosely coiled in the palm of the dominant hand. 23. Insert the catheter (Do Not force the catheter if resistance is met)      24. Inflate catheter balloon with the provided prefilled syringe with sterile water per the manufacturer’s instructions.  Gently pull back on the catheter until resistance is met. 25. Secure the tubing.      26. Place the drainage bag below the level of the bladder. Do not place the bag on the side rails of the bed, and ensure there were no dependent loops in the tubing. 27. Obtained a sterile specimen as needed from the most proximal port using aseptic technique. 28. Discard supplies, perform hand hygiene 39. Observe characteristics and amount of urine in the drainage system and document in the patients chart. a. Males:  Anchor catheter to lower abdomen and tubing to the thigh. b. Females:  Anchor catheter and tubing to the thigh. In both cases ensure slack in the catheter so movement does not create tension on the catheter. Maintenance of closed Urinary Drainage System 1. Perform hand hygiene.  2. Identify patient using 2 identifiers, and explain procedure. 3. Gather supplies needed for routine perineal care. 4. Perform hand hygiene and don gloves. 5. Raise bed to appropriate working height, lower side rails on working side. 6. Inspect urine for color, clarity and amount. 7. Ensure tubing is intact and is not kinked. 6. Position the patient and cover with a blanket only exposing the perineal area and place a water proof pad under the patient.   a. Male: Supine position b. Female: Dorsal Recumbent position 7. Remove Catheter anchor device.  8. Expose urethral meatus with non-dominant hand.      9. Assess the perineal area for redness, swelling and discharge, as well as assessing the patient’s a. Males:  Retract foreskin if patient is not circumcised. Hold penis at shaft just below      glans, maintaining hand position throughout procedure. b. Female:  Gently retract labia to fully expose urethral meatus and catheter insertion site,      maintain position of hand throughout procedure.   29                                                       approved wipes to clean the area around and where the catheter comes in contact with    the perineum or meatus.   pain level.  10. Provide routine perineal care with soap and water.  a. Stabilize catheter using non-dominant hand. Use clean washcloth or prepackaged,      b. Remove all traces of soap and pat dry with a clean towel. For males, reduce or reposition        the foreskin after care.  c. Replace, as necessary, the anchor device.  d. Avoid pulling on or placing tension on the catheter.    11. Discard supplies, remove gloves, and perform hand hygiene. 12. Lower the level of the bed, and position side rails accordingly. 13. Document procedure in patient’s medical record. Remove Closed Urinary Drainage System 1. Verify physician’s order. 2. Identify correct patient using 2 identifiers and explain the procedure. 3. Preform hand hygiene and done gloves. 4. Raise the bed to an appropriate working height and position the patient. 5. Place a waterproof pad (chux) under the patient. 6. Obtain a sample if needed. 7. Remove the catheter anchoring device. 8. Assess for discharge or redness around the urethral meatus. 9. Insert the hub of a syringe into the catheter's inflation valve. Allow sterile water from the balloon to return to the syringe by gravity until the plunger stops moving and the amount originally instilled is removed. Set the syringe aside for later discard. 10. Pull out the catheter slowly and gently while wrapping the now-contaminated catheter in a waterproof pad. The catheter should slide out very easily. Do not use force. If any resistance is met, use the syringe again to remove any remaining fluid in the inflation port, and notify the practitioner. Notify the practitioner if unable to remove the catheter. 11. Inspect the condition of the urethra and surrounding tissue, and ask the patient if he or she is comfortable. 12. Reposition the patient as necessary. Cleanse the perineum. Lower the level of the bed, and position side rails accordingly.  13. Unhook the collection bag and drainage tubing from the bed. Empty, measure, and record the urine present in the drainage bag. Send the urine specimen to the lab, if applicable. 14. Discard supplies, remove gloves, and perform hand hygiene. 15. Document the procedure in the patient’s record.   30                                           Apply and Remove a Pediatric Urine Collection Bag a. Female:  adhere bag to perineal area first and secure adhesive tabs in an upward motion to symphysis, ensuring the bag is position to catch urine. b. Males:  place penis inside of bag and secure adhesive tabs ensuring the bag is in position to catch urine.  1. Verify physician’s order. 2. Identify correct patient using 2 identifiers and explain the procedure. 3. Preform hand hygiene and don gloves. 4. Clean the perineal are with soap and water if needed. 5.
