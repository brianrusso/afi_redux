Purpose.  Nonjudicial  punishment  (NJP)  provides  commanders  with  an  essential  and prompt  means  of  maintaining  good  order  and  discipline  and  also  promotes  positive  behavior changes in service members without the stigma of a court-martial conviction. See MCM, Part V, paragraphs 1b, 1c and 1e on the nature of NJP. Commanders should consider, where appropriate, nonpunitive  disciplinary  measures,  such  as  counseling,  administrative  reprimands  and administrative  withholding  of  privileges  before  resorting  to  NJP,  but  such  measures  are  not necessary before imposing NJP. MCM, Part V, paragraph 1g. 1.2.  Forms.  Use  the  following  forms  to  record  NJP  actions:  AF  Form  3070,  Record  of Nonjudicial  Punishment  Proceedings;  AF  Form  366,  Record  of  Proceedings  of  Vacation  of Suspended Nonjudicial Punishment; and AF Form 3212, Record of Supplementary Action under Article 15, UCMJ.  Note:  Although referenced generally as the AF Form 3070 throughout this publication, the form is further subdivided into three categories to be used depending on the rank of the member at the time NJP is offered by the commander (3070A for AB – TSgt, 3070B for MSgt – CMSgt, and 3070C for officers; See Section 6F). 1.3.  Supervisory  Authority.  The  officer  exercising  general  court-martial supervises all NJP within the command. See paragraph 6.7. jurisdiction 1.4.  Air  Force  Academy  Cadets.  For purposes  of this instruction, the term "officer" includes cadets of the US Air Force Academy (USAFA). 1.5.  Reporting  Senior  Officer  Cases.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  reporting  NJP  actions on  colonel  selects  and  above  to  SAF/IGS  (for  general  officers)  or  SAF/IGQ  (for  colonels  and colonel  selects)  when  initiated  and  when  final  action  is  complete,  in  accordance  with  AFI  90-301,  Inspector  General  Complaints.    Also,  commanders  must  comply  with  the  reporting requirements  to  SAF/IGQ  for  substantiated  allegations  against  Majors  and  Lieutenant  Colonels in accordance with AFI 90-301, Table 5.3.  The servicing staff judge advocate (SJA) will provide commanders  a  copy  of  the  completed  AF  Form  3070,  Record  of  Nonjudicial  Punishment Proceedings, with any attachments and supporting documentation, for forwarding to SAF/IGS or SAF/IGQ.  (T-1). 1.6.  Cases  Involving  State  or  Foreign  Prosecution  Interest.  If substantially the same act  or omission  is  subject  to  NJP  proceedings  and  to  trial  in  a  state  or  foreign  court,  consult  AFI  51-201,  Administration  of  Military  Justice.  Only  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  may  approve initiation  of  NJP  action  against  a  member  who  has  been  previously  tried  by  a  state  or  foreign court for the same act or omission, regardless of the outcome. 1.7.  Authority:  This AFI is the authority for legal service support listed in this instruction.  No other order, writing, or implementing agreement is required unless otherwise provided for herein. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   7  Chapter 2 AUTHORITY FOR IMPOSING NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT  2.1.  Authority  of  Commanders.  Commanders  who  are  commissioned  officers  may  impose NJP on members of their commands for minor offenses. MCM, Part V, paragraphs 1e and 2a. 2.2.  Commanders.  "Commander"  means  a  commissioned  officer  who,  by  virtue  of  rank  and assignment,  exercises  primary  command  authority  over  a  military  organization  recognized  as  a command.  (MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  2a).  An  Air  Force  officer  who  has  assumed  or  been appointed  to  command  of  an  Air  Force  organization  IAW  AFI  51-604,  Appointment  to  and Assumption  of  Command,  is  a  “commander”  under  this  AFI.  For  purposes  of  nonjudicial punishment, “commanders” are: 2.2.1.  A commander of an Air Force unit, as defined in Attachment 1. 2.2.2.  Commander,  Air  Force  Forces  (COMAFFOR),  which  is  an  officer  designated  from the U.S. Air Force who serves as the commander of all U.S. Air Force forces assigned and attached  to  the  U.S.  Air  Force  component  in  a  joint  or  combined  operation.  COMAFFORs command  the  U.S.  Air  Force  components  of  unified  commands,  specified  commands, subordinate  unified  commands,  joint  task  forces,  combined  commands,  and  combined  task forces. 2.2.3.  The commander of an Air Force element, if designated to function as a unit pursuant to  AFI  38-101,  Air  Force  Organization.  This  includes  the  Air  Force  element  of  a headquarters  unit  in  a  joint  or  combined  command  or  task  force,  as  well  as  the  Air  Force element of an activity outside the Air Force. See definition of “activity outside the Air Force” in Attachment 1. 2.2.4.  Commanders  of  detachments,  headquarters  and  squadron  sections,  and  Air  Force element  sections,  if  properly  appointed  to  command  on  special  orders.  See  MCM,  Part  V, paragraph 2; AFI 38-101; and AFI 51-604. 2.2.5.  The  Senior  Air  Force  Officer  (SAFO)  in  the  headquarters  staff  organization  of  a unified  command,  subordinate  unified  command,  specified  command,  joint  task  force, combined  command,  or  combined  task  force,  with  respect  to  Air  Force  members  in  the headquarters  staff  organization.  Also,  the  SAFO  in  the  Air  Force  element  of  an  activity outside the Air Force, as defined in Attachment 1, with respect to Air Force members in the activity. 2.2.5.1.  The SAFO must be an officer otherwise eligible to command under AFI 51-604. 2.2.5.2.  If the Air Force element of the staff organization is designated to function as a unit  pursuant  to  AFI  38-101,  the  Air  Force  element  commander  should  exercise  NJP authority  instead  of  the  SAFO.  See  paragraph  2.2.3.  However,  the  exercise  of  NJP authority  by  an  Air  Force  element  commander  does  not  divest  the  SAFO  of  concurrent authority to exercise NJP authority under paragraph 2.2.5. 2.2.6.  The  commander  of  Air  Force  District  of  Washington  (AFDW),  Joint  Base  Andrews Naval  Air  Facility  Washington,  MD,  and  the  commanders  of  subordinate  units  when designated by the commander of  AFDW, for  Air Force members  assigned to  the Air Force   8  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 element of an activity outside the Air Force, as defined in Attachment 1.  This NJP authority is  held  concurrently  with  element  commanders  and  SAFOs  of  activities  outside  the  Air Force, as designated in paragraphs 2.2.3 and 2.2.5, respectively. 2.2.7.  The Superintendent of the U.S. Air Force Academy and the commandant of a school that is designated as an Air Force unit. 2.2.8.  The commander of a host command, and the commanders of subordinate units when designated  by  the  host  commander,  providing  support  to  a  tenant  organization  pursuant  to AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures, Chapter 6. 2.2.9.  Joint  force  commanders  of  joint  activities  established  under  the  criteria  of  Joint Publication  0-2,  Unified  Action  Armed  Forces,  that  being  unified  commands,  specified commands, subordinate unified commands, and joint task forces. 2.2.10.  Multiservice  commanders  in  combined  commands,  combined  task  forces,  and activities outside the Air Force, as defined in Attachment 1, to whose command members of the Air Force are assigned or attached. The multiservice commander must be an officer in the U.S. Armed Forces with command authority over the Air Force member. 2.3.  Members  of  their  Command.  As  used  in  this  instruction,  "members  of  their  command" includes  the  assigned  members  of  the  element  or  organization  commanded  and  members  on temporary duty (TDY) with, or otherwise attached to, the element or organization. 2.3.1.  A  member  need  not  be  attached  on  TDY  orders  for  the  commander  to  exercise  NJP authority  if  the  commander  exercises  the  usual  responsibilities  of  command  over  the member. A TDY commander has concurrent authority with the commander of the member's element or organization of permanent assignment. 2.3.2.  A  commander  will  not  impose  NJP  on  a  member  after  that  member  has  been transferred from the command. If an NJP proceeding has been initiated but punishment was not imposed prior to the transfer, the commander who initiated the proceeding may forward the record of proceeding to the gaining commander for appropriate disposition. If a member transfers  after  punishment  has  been  imposed  but  before  the  action  is  complete,  the  action (including adjudication of any appeal) will be completed by the imposing commander’s chain of command. 2.4.  Host Command Jurisdiction.  All members of a tenant unit or Air Force element, whether designated a unit or not, are attached to  the host command and its appropriate subordinate and higher commands for the exercise of nonjudicial punishment authority under Article 15, UCMJ.  However, commanders of tenant units, and other Air Force element officers authorized to impose nonjudicial  punishment  pursuant  to  this  instruction,  retain  concurrent  authority  to  take  such action. 2.4.1.  Any  appeal  from  nonjudicial  punishment  is  made  to  the  superior  authority  in  the command  channel  of  the  officer  who  imposes  punishment  or  to  the  appeal  authority otherwise designated by AFLOA/JAJM. 2.4.2.  Regardless  of  who  imposes  punishment  or  acts  on  the  appeal,  the  action  is administratively processed through the host command’s SJA. 2.4.3.  In a Joint Command, if nonjudicial punishment is  imposed on an  Air Force member by  a  commander  of  a  different  service,  the  decisions  as  to  collateral  administrative  actions AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   9  (e.g., entry into UIF or selection record) will be made by the SAFO or commander of the Air Force element in the Joint Command. 2.4.3.1.  If  the  SAFO  or  commander  of  the  Air  Force  element  is  unavailable  or  is  not senior to the commander who imposed nonjudicial punishment, decisions as to collateral administrative  actions  (e.g.,  entry  into  UIF  or  selection  record)  are  made  by  a  general court-martial  convening  authority  (GCMCA)  of  the  Air  Force  Host  Command  who  is senior  to  the  commander  who  imposed  nonjudicial  punishment.    If  the  Air  Force  Host Command GCMCA is not senior to the commander who imposed punishment, collateral administrative  action  decisions  will  be  made  by  a  GCMCA,  who  is  senior  to  the commander  who  imposed  punishment,  designated  by  the  respective  Air  Force  Host Command’s MAJCOM commander. 2.5.  Nonjudicial  Punishment  Authority  in  a  Joint  Force.  A  joint  force  is  composed  of significant elements, assigned or attached, of two or more Military Departments operating under a  single  commander  authorized  to  exercise  operational  control  over  the  force  to  accomplish  an assigned  mission.  Joint  forces  are  established  at  unified  commands,  specified  commands, subordinate unified commands, and joint  task forces.  Joint forces organizationally  consist  of a joint force commander, a joint staff organization, and Service component commands. See  Joint Publication  0-2  and  Air  Force  Doctrine  Document  2,  Organization  and  Employment  of Aerospace Power. 2.5.1.  The  joint  force  commander  has  authority  to  impose  NJP  on  Air  Force  members assigned  or  attached  to  the  command,  regardless  of  the  commander's  parent  service,  unless such authority is withheld by a superior joint commander. Air Force members are "assigned or attached to the command" of a joint force commander if they are assigned or attached to the joint staff organization, or assigned or attached to a unit which is assigned or attached to the joint force. 2.5.2.  In  accordance  with  Joint  Publication  0-2,  joint  force  commanders  will  use  this instruction  when  imposing  NJP  on  Air  Force  members;  however,  joint  force  commanders should  normally  allow  NJP  authority  over  Air  Force  members  to  be  exercised  by  the appropriate Air Force commander.  Matters that involve more than one service or that occur outside  a  military  reservation,  but  within  the  joint  force  commander's  jurisdiction,  may  be handled  either  by  the  joint  force  commander  or,  unless  withheld  by  the  joint  force commander,  by  the  appropriate  Air  Force  commander.  The  appropriate  Air  Force commander should normally handle matters that involve only the Air Force, and occur on a military reservation or within the military jurisdiction of the Air Force. 2.6.  Procedures  for  Imposing  Nonjudicial  Punishment  in  a  Joint  Force.  If  the  joint  force commander  decides  to  personally  initiate  NJP  proceedings  against  an  Air  Force  member,  the joint  force  commander  should  coordinate  with  the  appropriate  Air  Force  commander  before taking action to ensure procedural awareness and compliance. 2.6.1.  The  appropriate  Air  Force  commander  immediately  notifies  the  servicing  Air  Force SJA. See AFI 25-201, Support Agreements Procedures. The servicing Air Force SJA: 2.6.1.1.  Coordinates with the SJA assigned to the joint force commander. 2.6.1.2.  Advises  on  Air  Force  policy  and  NJP  procedures,  including  the  application  of Air Force regulations in the administration and processing of NJP actions, and assists the   10  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 joint  force  SJA  in  ensuring  the  NJP  action  is  properly  completed  by  the  joint  force commander. 2.6.1.3.  Enters  the  NJP  proceedings  into  the  Automated  Military  Justice  Analysis  and Management System (AMJAMS) and ensures appropriate personnel and finance actions are  taken,  including  the  filing  of  the  action  in  appropriate  personnel  records  as  well  as Unfavorable Information Files (UIF) and/or selection records. See paragraphs 4.8.1. and 6.4.2.2. to identify the Air Force officer responsible for deciding selection record and UIF actions. 2.6.2.  If  an  Air  Force  judge  advocate  is  assigned  to  the  joint  force  commander,  he  or  she may provide advice to the joint force SJA in lieu of the servicing Air Force SJA for the host command.  In  such  cases,  however,  the  servicing  Air  Force  SJA  shall  be  notified  of  the occasion  and  nature  of  the  advice  and  action  and  shall  remain  responsible  for  the  required AMJAMS entries and personnel records and finance actions. 2.6.3.  If  the  joint  force  commander  determines  NJP  authority  over  an  Air  Force  member should  be  left  to  the  discretion  of  Air  Force  authorities,  the  appropriate  Air  Force commander,  as  identified  in  paragraph  2.2.,  may  take  action.  Regardless  of  who  imposes punishment,  the  action  (i.e.,  AMJAMS,  personnel  actions,  and  finance  actions)  shall  be processed through the servicing Air Force SJA for the host command. 2.7.  Procedures  for  Multiservice  Commanders.  The  multiservice  commander,  when imposing  NJP  on  an  Air  Force  member,  follows  this  instruction,  including  the  guidance applicable to joint force commanders in paragraph 2.4.2. and procedures consistent with those in paragraph  2.6.  Before  initiating  any  NJP  action,  ensure  the  multiservice  commander  has command  authority  over  the  member  involved,  the  appellate  authority  is  identified  (see paragraph 4.2.8.), and administrative processing issues are understood. 2.7.1.  The commander’s principle assistant is the officer who would assume command in the event of the commander's death, prolonged absence, or disability, or the vice-commander of the organization. See AFI  51-604. However, if that  officer is  located at  another station, the commander may delegate authority to the officer on the commander's station next eligible to assume command. 2.7.2.  SAFOs  described  in  paragraph  2.2.5,  who  are  general  officers,  may  delegate  their powers  under  Article  15,  UCMJ,  to  the  next  senior  Air  Force  officer  or  another  principal assistant who is generally equivalent to a vice commander. 2.8.  Delegation  of  Authority.  Commanders  who  are  general  officers  or  who  exercise  general court-martial  convening  authority  (GCMCA)  may  delegate  their  powers  under  Article  15, UCMJ, to a principal assistant. The principal  assistant then assumes the commander's authority to  impose  NJP  on  members  of  the  command  who  are  subordinate  to  the  principal  assistant. Principal assistants must be military officers to exercise NJP authority, and may impose only the amount of punishment authorized for their grades (MCM, Part V, paragraph 5b).  Delegation of such  authority  must  be  in  writing  or  incorporated  in  a  permanent  directive,  and  should  be addressed  to  the  principal  assistant  by  duty  title,  rather  than  by  name,  except  as  described  in paragraph 2.8.2. The original written delegation or directive shall be filed in the office of the SJA servicing the commander concerned. A delegation made by duty title continues in effect when a new principal  assistant occupies the position or  when command changes to  a new commander, AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   11  unless  or  until  expressly  rescinded.  A  commander  delegating  NJP  punishment  authority  also retains the authority to administer nonjudicial punishment in the commander's own right. 2.8.1.  The commander's principal assistant is the officer who would assume command in the event of the commander's death, prolonged absence, or disability, or the vice commander of the organization. See AFI  51-604. However, if that  officer is  located at  another station, the commander may delegate authority to the officer on the commander's station next eligible to assume command. 2.8.2.  SAFOs  described  in  paragraph  2.2.5.,  who  are  general  officers,  may  delegate  their powers  under  Article  15,  UCMJ,  to  the  next  senior  Air  Force  officer  or  another  principal assistant who is generally equivalent to a vice commander. 2.9.  Commander  as  Victim.  If  a  commander  is  the  victim  of  a  crime  in  his  or  her  personal capacity  (e.g.,  victim  of  assault  or  larceny)  as  opposed  to  official  capacity  (e.g.,  violation  of commander's order), that commander should forward the report of the incident to the next higher commander for review and appropriate action. 2.10.  Air  Force  Cadets.  Only  the  Commandant  of  Cadets,  a  superior  commander  at  the USAFA,  or  a  commander  designated  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  may  impose  NJP  on USAFA cadets. 2.11.  Air  Force  Legal  Operations  Agency.  All  judge  advocates  assigned  as  senior  trial  and defense counsel, area defense counsel, defense paralegals, special victims’ counsel, and special victims’ paralegals are assigned to Air Force Legal Operations Agency (AFLOA) for jurisdiction under Article 15, UCMJ. All military judges, to include trial and appellate judges, are assigned to the Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) for jurisdiction under Article 15, UCMJ. 2.12.  Withholding  Authority.  A  commander  at  any  echelon  may  withhold  from  any subordinate commander  all or part of the  authority—including the  authority to  impose NJP for specific types of offenses—that the subordinate would otherwise have under the UCMJ, MCM, or this instruction. When authority is withheld, such action should be in a clearly defined writing or  permanent  directive.  File  the  original  of  the  letter  or  directive  in  the  office  of  the  SJA servicing the commander withholding the authority. File a copy in the office of the SJA servicing the  commander  whose  authority  has  been  withheld.  Any  such  withholding  remains  in  effect when  a  new  commander  assumes  either  command,  until  and  unless  expressly  revoked  by  the superior commander. Any such action should be addressed by duty title and not by name. 2.13.  Exceptions  to  Support  Agreements.  When  a  support  agreement  differing  from  the construct  outlined  in  this  instruction  is  necessary  or  desirable,  it  must  be  documented  at  the GCMCA level or higher. (T-2).   12  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 3 PROCEDURES FOR INITIATING AND IMPOSING NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT Section 3A—Responsibilities of the Initiating Commander 3.1.  General  Responsibilities.  Commanders  who  initiate  NJP  action  and  impose  punishment act on the basis of information they determine relevant. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 4c(3), for the  limited  applicability  of  the  Military  Rules  of  Evidence.  The  commander's  action  must  be temperate,  just,  and  conducive  to  good  order  and  discipline.  Although  it  is  the  SJA’s responsibility to advise and help the commander to evaluate the facts and determine what offense was committed, if any, it is the commander who makes the decision to impose punishment and the degree of punishment. 3.2.  Notice  of  Recoupment  of  Benefits.  Concurrent  with  initiation  of  the  NJP  action,  the initiating  commander  must  provide  written  notice  to  a  member  who  has  received  educational assistance,  special  pay,  or  bonuses  concerning  the  member's  obligation  to  reimburse  the  Air Force if the member is discharged (or involuntarily separated) for misconduct. (T-0). This notice shall be accomplished in item 3 of the AF Form 3070. (T-3). The member's signature in item 3 constitutes  acknowledgement  of  this  notice.  The  statement  of  understanding  regarding recoupment  is  inserted  in  item  14  as  a  continuation  of  item  3.  (See  Attachment  2  for  a  sample statement). Noncompliance with this provision shall not  affect the legal  sufficiency  of the NJP action. 3.3.  Timeliness  of  Actions.  In  order  to  maximize  disciplinary  and  rehabilitative  effect,  NJP should  be  offered  as  soon  as  possible  after  facts  become  known  by  the  member’s  commander that indicate that offenses may have been committed. Commanders should offer NJP within 21 days of the date of discovery of the offense.  However, failure to meet this processing goal shall not  preclude  a  commander  from  initiating  NJP  proceedings.    NJP  actions  should  be  complete (Servicing  SJA  Review)  within  18  days  of  the  offer  date,  (the  18  day  goal  is  broken  down  as follows: 9 days from offer of NJP to serving of the punishment and 9 days from the serving of the punishment to Servicing SJA Review).  The impartial and timely administration of military justice  helps  sustain  good  order  and  discipline.    SJAs  and  chiefs  of  military  justice  should regularly  analyze  the  (AMJAMS)  data  as  to  each  segment  of  NJP  processing  they  control  to determine specific areas for improvement, and implement appropriate management measures to maximize effectiveness and efficiency.  The following metrics have been established to assist in expediting the administration of justice: 3.3.1.  Complete 80% of all NJP actions (Date of Discovery of the Offense through Servicing SJA Review Date) within 39 days. 3.3.2.  The  date  of  discovery  of  the  offense  is  defined  as  the  date  when  an  investigative agency (e.g., OSI, SFOI, IG), legal office, commander, supervisor, or first sergeant becomes aware of an allegation and a subject has been identified, including when notification is made by civilian authorities.  In a case involving a Commander Directed Investigation (CDI), the date  of  discovery  of  an  offense  is  when  a  commander  is  notified  of  an  allegation  that  an offense has been committed and a subject has been identified.  If an allegation is investigated by CDI and is subsequently turned over to an investigative agency for further investigation, use  the  date  the  commander  first  became  aware  of  the  allegation  and  a  subject  has  been AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   13  identified.    In  all  cases,  where  additional  allegations  against  an  identified  subject  are discovered, use the earliest date of discovery of all offenses. 3.4.  Standard  of  Proof.  While  no  specific  standard  of  proof  applies  to  NJP  proceedings, including  appeals,  commanders  should  recognize  that  a  member  is  entitled  to  demand  trial  by court-martial, in  which case proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each element of every offense by legal and competent evidence is a prerequisite to conviction. Whether such proof is available should be considered before initiating action under Article 15, UCMJ. If  such proof is  lacking, NJP action is usually not advisable. 3.5.  Providing  Evidence  to  the  Member.  After a commander serves the AF Form 3070 on a member, that member and his counsel have a right to examine all statements and other evidence that  the  commander  has  examined  and  intends  to  rely  upon  in  arriving  at  a  decision  to  impose punishment, and the quantum of punishment to be imposed.  Members are normally provided a copy  of  the  documentary  evidence  unless  the  matters  are  privileged,  classified,  or  otherwise restricted by law, regulation, or instruction. Section 3B—Initiating Nonjudicial Punishment 3.6.  Initial  Considerations.  After making a preliminary inquiry, the commander consults with the  servicing  SJA  to  determine  whether  NJP  is  appropriate  under  the  circumstances  and,  if  so, whether the commander can initiate proceedings personally, or should or must refer the matter to a  superior  commander  for  action.    Such  referral  is  appropriate  when  the  commander  cannot impose an appropriate punishment because of the member's grade, or where authority has been withheld. See Table 3.1 and Table 3.2, and paragraph 2.10. 3.6.1.  When  initiation  of  NJP  action  is  under  consideration,  the  member’s  personal  data  is normally available to the legal office through the (AMJAMS). The member’s personal data is also  available  by  requesting  an  AMJAMS  Report  on  Individual  Personnel  (RIP)  from  the member’s  servicing  Military  Personnel  Flight  (MPF).  However,  don’t  delay  initiation  for receipt of an AMJAMS RIP. 3.7.  Members  Attached  to  the  Command.  In  some  cases,  commanders  initiate  NJP proceedings against members who are in their commands by virtue of being TDY or otherwise attached  to  the  commander's  organization.  In  these  cases,  the  commander  should  confer whenever possible with the member's parent organization commander about whether NJP should be  offered  by  the  TDY  commander  or  the  parent  organization  commander.  If  the  TDY commander  intends  to  initiate  NJP,  he  or  she  should  confer  with  the  parent  organization commander  concerning  the  member's  background,  past  duty  performance,  and  other  relevant factors  before  initiating  the  action.  If  member  is  in  the  Air  Force  Reserve,  prior  coordination with  the  member’s  parent  organization  commander  is  required.  (T-3).    If  member  is  in  the  Air National Guard, prior coordination with the member’s assigned Title 10 ADCON commander is required. (T-3). 3.8.  Description  of  Offense.  The  SJA  should  advise  the  commander  how  to  properly  allege each  offense  to  state  a  violation  of  the  UCMJ,  consistent  with  available  facts  and  evidence. Follow the form of specifications in MCM, Part IV. However, an NJP action remains valid even if  the  specification  fails  to  include  all  the  elements  of  an  offense,  provided  that  the  member  is   14  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 reasonably informed of the nature of the alleged misconduct. The legal office shall provide the language describing each offense on the AF Form 3070, except where impractical. (T-3). 3.9.  Notifying the Member. 3.9.1.  A  commander  initiating  an  NJP  proceeding  completes  item  1  of  the  AF  Form  3070, signs  and  dates  the  form,  and  causes  the  member  to  be  notified  and  advised  of  his  or  her rights using AF Form 3070. MCM, Part V, paragraph 4a. Normally, the initiating commander notifies and serves the member, then signs and annotates the date and time the member was served notice of the proceeding in item 2 of the AF Form 3070. Where circumstances prevent the  initiating  commander  from  personally  notifying  and  serving  the  AF  Form  3070  on  the member or the initiating commander elects not to do so, the initiating commander may direct a  subordinate,  senior  in  rank  to  the  member  (when  practicable),  to  notify  and  serve  the member. The subordinate annotates the date and time of service and signs in item 2 of the AF Form 3070 as the person serving the member. Regardless of who serves the member, provide the member with a copy of all three pages of the AF Form 3070 and any attachments. Also make  available  to  the  member  all  statements  and  evidence  upon  which  the  commander intends to rely in making his or her decision. 3.9.2.  If  a  commander  refers  the  matter  to  a  superior  commander,  the  superior  commander should normally initiate the NJP action and provide the notification. Where it is not practical for  the  member  to  appear  personally  before  the  superior  commander,  the  subordinate commander  may  initiate  the  NJP  proceeding  using  the  AF  Form  3070,  item  1.a.(2).  When doing  so,  the  subordinate  commander  notifies  the  member  that  NJP  proceedings  before  a superior  commander  are  being  recommended  (including  the  identity  of  the  superior commander) and advises the member of his or her rights. 3.9.3.  A commander who initially recommended NJP proceedings by a superior commander may  dispose  of  the  case  personally  if  the  AF  Form  3070  has  not  been  forwarded  to  the superior commander. If the commander does not intend to personally pursue the matter as an NJP  action,  the  commander  withdraws  the  AF  Form  3070  and  provides  it  to  the  servicing SJA  so  termination  of  NJP  proceedings  can  be  recorded  in  AMJAMS.  If  the  commander intends  to  personally  pursue  the  matter  as  an  NJP  action,  the  commander  has  two  options. First,  the  commander  may  notify  the  member  by  memorandum  that  he  or  she  intends  to decide whether to impose punishment under the pending NJP action instead of the superior commander,  giving  the  member  a  new  opportunity  (three  duty  days)  to  accept  NJP proceedings or demand trial by court-martial. Attach the memorandum to the AF Form 3070. Alternatively, the commander may withdraw the existing action and initiate a new action on a new AF Form 3070. 3.10.  Changing  Commanders  before  Nonjudicial  Punishment  Proceedings  are Complete.  A  member  must  always  be  informed  of  the  identity  of  the  commander  who  will actually make the findings and punishment decisions before a decision is required as to whether to accept nonjudicial punishment or demand court-martial. (T-0). 3.10.1.  If  a  new  commander  assumes  responsibility  for  the  case  after  the  member  was offered  NJP  proceedings,  but  before  findings  are  made  and  punishment,  if  any,  has  been imposed, inform the member of the identity of the new commander and provide 3 duty days to  accept  NJP  proceedings  or  to  demand  trial  by  court-martial.  (T-0).  The  new  commander accomplishes  this  by  either  notifying  the  member  about  the  change  in  writing,  using  the AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   15  notification format in Attachment 3, or by withdrawing the old AF Form 3070 and initiating a  new  action  on  a  new  AF  Form  3070.  If  the  notification  format  is  used,  it  becomes  an attachment to the AF Form 3070. 3.10.2.  If  a  change  in  commanders  occurs  after  imposition  of  punishment  but  before  the appeal  decision  has  been  made,  inform  the  member  in  writing  of  the  identity  of  the  new commander  and  obtain  an  acknowledgment  of  this  change  from  the  member.  Attach  the notification  and  acknowledgment  to  the  original  AF  Form  3070.  Such  a  change  neither impacts the former commander’s action nor affords the member additional rights or response time. The new commander has full authority to ensure completion of the action. However, if an  appeal  is  made,  the  former  commander  must  prepare  a  written  summary  of  any  oral presentation  and  the  source  and  substance  of  any  other  information  considered,  consistent with  paragraph  4.6.3.  (T-0).  Notification  of  a  change  in  commanders  merely  for  the Unfavorable Information File (UIF) decision (paragraph 6.4.2) is not required. 3.10.3.  If  a  commander  notifies  a  member  of  the  intent  to  recommend  that  a  superior commander impose NJP, a change of the superior commander provides the identical rights, creating a new opportunity to accept or reject NJP. The subordinate commander follows the procedures set forth above in such situations. 3.11.  Discovery  of  Additional  Offenses.  When  evidence  of  an  additional  offense  or  offenses arises  following  initiation  of  NJP  proceedings,  but  before  the  member  is  notified  of  the punishment, a commander may: 3.11.1.  Withdraw the initial AF Form 3070 and reinitiate NJP to include all offenses. If the form has been sent to a superior commander, do so only with the superior's agreement; or 3.11.2.  Proceed  with  the  initial  NJP  proceeding  and  offer  a  second  NJP  for  the  additional offense or offenses. 3.12.  Member’s Decision to Accept or Reject  Nonjudicial  Punishment.  Acceptance of NJP is  a  choice  of  forum,  not  an  admission  of  guilt.  The  member  has  three  duty  days  to  accept  or reject  NJP  following  notification  of  the  intent  to  impose  NJP.  Weekends  and  holidays  are counted  if  they  are  normally  scheduled  duty  days  for  the  member.  In  practical  application,  the member is not required to accept or reject NJP sooner than 72 hours following notification of the intent  to  impose  NJP.  The  initiating  commander  may,  upon  written  application,  grant  an extension for good cause.  Note:  For traditional reservists or ANG members in Title 10 status, three duty days includes unit training assemblies (UTAs), annual tour (AT) days, or other days in which the member is in a military status, whether paid or unpaid.  Duty days do not include any days in which the member is not in a military status, whether paid or unpaid. 3.12.1.  Members must reflect their NJP decision by initialing the appropriate blocks in item 3  of  the  AF  Form  3070,  sign,  and  then  annotate  the  date  and  time  signed.  (T-0).  Member must initial whether or not the member: 3.12.1.1.  Consulted a lawyer. (T-0). 3.12.1.2.  Demands trial by court-martial or waives the right to court-martial and accepts NJP proceedings. (T-0). 3.12.1.3.  Attached a written presentation. (T-0).   16  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 3.12.1.4.  Requests a personal appearance before the commander and whether or not the member requests the personal appearance be public. (T-0). 3.12.2.  The  member  has  a  right  to  consult  a  lawyer  before  making  any  decisions,  and  a lawyer may assist the member throughout the proceedings. The location and phone number of the closest military defense counsel should be provided to the member to further explain the member's rights. The member may retain civilian counsel at the member's own expense. The commander should encourage the member to take full advantage of this time to consult with legal counsel, to decide whether to accept NJP proceedings, and if so, to prepare matters in defense, extenuation, or mitigation. The right to legal counsel does not include the right to request  individual  military  defense  counsel  as  defined  in  MCM,  Part  II;  Rules  for  Courts-Martial  (RCM),  Rule  506(b)(1);  and  AFI  51-201.  However,  where  a  member  asserts  an attorney-client  relationship  with  a  military  defense  counsel  other  than  the  detailed  military defense  counsel,  in  regard  to  the  same  matter  for  which  he  or  she  is  being  offered  NJP, process the request for this counsel according to the provisions of AFI 51-201. 3.12.3.  If  a  member  does  not  reply  with  his  or  her  elections  in  time,  the  commander  may continue  with  the  proceedings  and  note  in  item  3  of  AF  Form  3070  "member  failed  to respond"  and  initial.  The  member's  failure  to  respond  in  time  is  deemed  an  acceptance  of nonjudicial proceedings under Article 15, UCMJ. However, if the commander has reason to believe  a  failure  to  respond  resulted  from  reasons  beyond  that  individual's  control,  the commander may not, without good cause, proceed with NJP action. 3.13.  Member's  Presentation.  See  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  4c.  A  member  is  generally entitled  to  appear  personally  before  the  imposing  commander  and  present  matters  in  defense, mitigation,  or  extenuation,  except  under  extraordinary  circumstances  or  when  the  imposing commander  is  unavailable.  There  is  no  requirement  that  a  lawyer  be  made  available  to accompany  the  member  at  a  personal  appearance.    See  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  4c(1)  for  the member's entitlements at a personal appearance. 3.13.1.  If a personal appearance before a superior commander in proceedings initiated under paragraph  3.9.2  is  prevented  by  the  unavailability  of  the  superior  commander  or  by extraordinary  circumstances,  the  member  may  appear  personally  before  the  subordinate commander  who  served  him  or  her  with  the  AF  Form  3070.  The  subordinate  commander then  prepares  a  memorandum  summarizing  the  presentation  and  forwards  it  to  the  superior commander, along with all written matters submitted by the member. 3.13.2.  Under  any  other  circumstances  where  a  personal  appearance  is  prevented  by  the unavailability  of  the  imposing  commander  or  by  other  extraordinary  circumstances,  the member  appears  personally  before  a  person  designated  by  the  imposing  commander.  The designee  prepares  a  memorandum  summarizing  the  presentation  and  forwards  it  to  the imposing commander, along with  all written matters submitted by the member. MCM, Part V, paragraph 4c(1). 3.13.3.  The  commander  may  open  the  personal  appearance  to  the  public,  even  though  the  member does not request it or agree the appearance should be open, subject to the  following restrictions.  Public  NJP  at  commander's  calls,  UTAs,  and  other  public  gatherings  is inappropriate  without  the  consent  of  the  member.  NJP  proceedings  may  be  attended  by  a limited  number  of  people  in  a  more  private  setting,  i.e.,  the  commander's  office.  The individuals  in  attendance  at  NJP  proceedings  should  normally  be  limited  to  those  in  the AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   17  member’s supervisory chain or people who can assist the decision authority (First Sergeant, Squadron Section Commander, etc.).  Public NJP during the offer  portion of the process at commander’s  calls, unit  training  assemblies and  other public  gatherings is  permissible with the  consent  of  the  member.  The  member  must  be  given  an  opportunity  to  consult  with counsel before deciding whether or not to consent to any such public proceedings. (T-0). 3.13.4.  If  the  proceedings  involve  a  waiver  of  the  statute  of  limitations,  the  member  must sign  a  written  waiver  that  becomes  an  attachment  to  the  AF  Form  3070.  (T-0).  See  MCM, Part V, paragraph 1f(4); RCM 907(b)(2)(B); and United States v. Moore, 32 M.J. 170 (CMA 1991). Section 3C—Imposing and Administering Punishments 3.14.  Commander's Findings. 3.14.1.  Following  full  and  fair  consideration  of  the  evidence,  including  any  matters presented by the member, the commander indicates one of the following actions in item 4.a. of the AF Form 3070 by marking or initialing the appropriate block on the form: 3.14.1.1.  The proceedings are terminated because NJP is not appropriate or because the member did not commit the offense(s) alleged. 3.14.1.2.  The  member  committed  one  or  more  offenses  alleged.  The  commander  lines out  and  initials  any  offense(s)  for  which  NJP  is  not  appropriate  or  that  the  member  did not  commit.  If  the  member  committed  one  or  more  lesser  included  offenses,  the commander consults with the SJA before changing an alleged offense to a lesser included offense. 3.14.2.  If  the  commander  terminates  the  proceedings,  the  commander  should  notify  the individual  of  this  decision,  and  send  the  original  AF  Form  3070  to  the  servicing  SJA  for appropriate AMJAMS entries. The AF Form 3070 is then destroyed. 3.15.  Commander’s Punishments.  The commander must consult the servicing SJA before the commander  imposes  punishment.  The  commander  may  consult  directly  with  an  attorney  from the SJA’s staff in lieu of the SJA. However, before providing a punishment recommendation on behalf of the SJA, the attorney from the SJA’s staff must consult with the servicing SJA. (T-3). A non-attorney may not provide punishment advice on behalf of the SJA. After the commander consults the servicing SJA, the commander completes item 4, and signs and dates the form in the indicated blocks. Punishment is  recorded in  item 14 of the AF Form 3070 as a continuation of 4.a.(2). See Attachment 5 for examples of punishment formats. The date of imposition of NJP is the  date  the  form  is  signed  by  the  commander  in  the  signature  block  in  item  4.  The  member should be informed of the punishment and acknowledge receipt of the action on the same date punishment is imposed. See paragraph 4.5.2. The commander may suspend all or a portion of the punishment  when  imposed.  If  the  commander  is  not  able  to  inform  the  member  of  the punishment  on  the  date  imposed,  the  member  should  be  informed  as  quickly  as  possible.  For additional guidance on suspension of punishment, see paragraph 5.4. 3.16.  Maximizing  the  Impact  of  Punishment.  Whenever  possible,  the  commander  should impose nonjudicial punishment personally.   18  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 3.17.  Permissible  Punishments.  Table  3.1  and  Table  3.2  set  out  the  maximum  permissible punishments, based on the grade and status of the commander and the grade of the member.  If, after  considering  matters  presented  by  the  member,  the  commander  determines  the  member committed  one  or  more  of  the  alleged  offenses  and  NJP  is  appropriate,  the  commander  must select  at  least  one  of  the  permissible  punishments  set  out  in  Table  3.1  or  Table  3.2.  (T-0).  However, if the commander determines the member should not  receive any form  of authorized punishment,  then  the  commander  must  find  that  NJP  is  not  appropriate  and  terminate  the proceedings. (T-0). 3.17.1.  The maximum authorized punishment in a single case is subject to the limitations in MCM, Part V, paragraph 5d. 3.17.2.  Commanders  should  generally  impose  an  unsuspended  reduction  in  grade  in combination  with  forfeitures  of  pay  only  when  the  maximum  exercise  of  NJP  authority  is warranted (e.g., repeat offender, most serious offenses, past rehabilitative efforts have failed, or  recalcitrant  offender).  This  general  policy  does  not  preclude  such  punishment  where warranted in the sound exercise of judgment by the commander imposing punishment. 3.17.3.  No  more  than  one-half  of  the  member’s  pay  per  month  is  subject  to  forfeiture, regardless of the number of Article 15s imposed. 3.17.4.  Subject to the restrictions outlined in this paragraph, extra duties imposed as part of NJP  may  be  required  to  be  performed  at  any  time  and  for  any  length  of  time  during  the period  of  punishment.  No  extra  duties  may  be  imposed  that  constitute:  cruel  or  unusual punishment;  punishment  not  sanctioned  by  the  customs  of  the  Air  Force  (e.g.,  using  the member  as  a  personal  servant);  duties  normally  intended  as  an  honor  (e.g.,  assignment  to honor guard);  actions required to  be performed in an unnecessarily degrading manner (e.g., an order to  clean  a  floor with  a toothbrush);  duties that are  a safety or health hazard to  the member; or duties that would demean the member’s position as an NCO. 3.18.  Punishment Effective Date.  Unsuspended reductions in grade and forfeitures of pay take effect  on  the  date  the  commander  imposes  punishment.  MCM, Part  V,  paragraph  5g.  All  other unsuspended  punishments  take  effect  immediately  upon  notification  to  the  member,  unless  the commander provides otherwise in the punishment endorsement. The suspension of a punishment takes  effect  on  the  date  the  commander  imposes  punishment,  not  the  date  the  member  was notified of the punishment. 3.18.1.  Prompt  execution  of  punishment  is  desired  absent  unique  circumstances,  which include, but  are not  limited to,  the member serving similar punishment from  a prior UCMJ action,  lack  of  available  space  in  a  correctional  custody  facility,  physical  incapacity  of  the member, emergency leave, and/or humanitarian considerations. 3.18.2.  Once  commenced,  punishments  involving  restraint  (i.e.,  correctional  custody, restrictions,  or  arrest  in  quarters)  or  extra  duties  run  continuously.  However,  these punishments may be stayed pursuant to the member's request based upon an appeal not being acted upon in accordance with MCM, Part V, paragraph 7d, or when temporarily interrupted due  to  either  the  fault  of  the  member  or  unique  circumstance  as  listed  above  in  paragraph 3.18.1. Note that special rules for imposing punishment on reserve component members may be authorized under MCM, Part V, paragraphs 5e and 5f. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   19  3.19.  Release  of  Information.  Public  release  of  information  subsequent  to  imposition  of punishment should be limited to an individual’s rank, offense, punishment and squadron. Do not release information that would readily identify the member. Section 3D—Action When the Member Demands Trial by Court-Martial 3.20.  Restrictions.  If a member demands trial by court-martial, the commander may not impose NJP. 3.21.  Commander's  Options.  The commander is  not  required to  prefer court-martial  charges, and  no  mandate  exists  to  refer  a  case  to  trial  by  court-martial.  Charges  and  specifications preferred  following  rejection  of  an  offered  Article  15  are  in  no  way  limited  to  those  originally included  in  the  offer.  The  form  and  substance  of  the  charges  may  be  altered  to  meet  legal  or proof requirements, and new charges may be added. 3.22.  Withdrawing  Demand  for  Trial.  Once  a  member  demands  trial,  the  member  may withdraw  this  demand  only  with  the  commander's  approval.  In  addition,  convening  authority concurrence is required if charges have been preferred. Procedurally, the member must submit a written  request  to  the  commander,  who  will  then  indorse  approval  or  disapproval.  (T-0).  The request will become an attachment to the AF Form 3070. If withdrawal is granted, pen and ink changes should be made in item 3 of the AF Form 3070 to reflect the member's new decision to accept  NJP  proceedings  and  the  commander  should  continue  with  the  NJP  proceedings.  While this is the preferred resolution, initiating a new NJP proceeding remains an alternative. Table 3.1.  Enlisted Punishments.

See MCM, Part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of punishments. For example, restriction and extra duties can be combined to run concurrently, but the combination must not be for a period in excess of the maximum duration imposable for extra duties. This means a field grade officer may combine 45 days of extra duties to run concurrently with 45 days of restriction when imposing NJP on an enlisted member. 2.  CMSgt or SMSgt may be reduced one grade only by MAJCOM commanders, commanders of unified or specified commands, or commanders to whom promotion authority to these grades has been delegated. See AFI 36-2502,  Airmen Promotion Program. 3.  Neither bread and water nor diminished rations punishments are authorized. 4.  Frocked commanders may exercise only that authority associated with their actual pay grade. No increased punishment authority is conferred by assumption of the title and insignia of the frocked grade. Table 3.2.  Officer Punishments.

Officers in the grade of Lieutenant Colonel and below (includes frocked Colonels) may not impose NJP on an officer. 2.  Only MAJCOM commanders, commanders of unified commands, and their equivalents, or higher may impose NJP on general officers. 3.  See MCM, Part V, paragraph 5d, for further limitations on combinations of punishments. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   21  Chapter 4 NONJUDICIAL PUNISHMENT APPEALS 4.1.  General  Guidance.  An appeal may be taken if a member considers the punishment to be unjust  or  disproportionate  to  the  offense.  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  7a.  The  findings,  the punishment,  or  both  may  be  appealed.  A  member  may  assert  the  punishment  is  unjust  because the offense was not committed. 4.2.  Appellate  Authority.  NJP  appeals  are  made  to  the  “next  superior  authority,”  who  is generally  the  immediate  Air  Force  commander  superior  to  the  officer  who  imposed  the punishment. For purposes of determining the “next superior authority,” a principal assistant who imposed  punishment  is  considered  the  functional  equivalent  of  the  officer  who  delegated  the power. Some situations call for application of the following special rules: 4.2.1.  When  a  principal  assistant  to  a  commander  of  an  Air  Force  establishment,  unit,  or non-unit  (other  than  Air  Force  elements  of  organizations  outside  the  Air  Force)  imposed punishment,  the  “next  superior  authority”  is  the  next  Air  Force  commander  superior  to  the commander who delegated the power. 4.2.2.  When a detachment commander imposes punishment, the “next superior authority” is the  detachment  commander’s  immediate  commander,  not  the  commander  of  the  host installation. 4.2.3.  When  a  section  commander  of  a  squadron  imposes  punishment,  the  "next  superior authority"  is  the  squadron  commander's  superior  commander.  However,  when  a  section commander  for  all  other  units  or  elements  imposes  punishment  (i.e.,  Group,  Wing, Numbered  Air  Force,  Major  Command,  Center,  Field  Operating  Agency,  and  Direct Reporting  Unit),  the  "next  superior  authority"  is  the  section  commander's  immediate commander. 4.2.4.  When  an  Air  Force  element  commander,  as  identified  in  paragraph  2.2.5.2,  imposes punishment, the "next superior authority" is the SAFO for elements under the SAFO's direct authority. 4.2.4.1.  A SAFO may not act as the "next superior authority" if the SAFO is not at least a  field  grade  officer  and  higher  in  grade  to  the  element  commander  who  imposed  the punishment. Paragraph 4.2.5 or 4.2.6 should be applied in these cases. 4.2.4.2.  A SAFO may not act as the "next superior authority" if the SAFO is also acting as the element commander. Paragraph 4.2.5 or 4.2.6 should be applied in these cases. 4.2.5.  When either a SAFO or Air Force element commander (whose SAFO is unable to act under  paragraph  4.2.4.1  and  4.2.4.2)  for  the  headquarters  staff  organization  in  a  unified command,  specified  command,  subordinate  unified  command,  joint  task  force,  combined command  or  combined  task  force  imposes  punishment,  the  "next  superior  authority"  is  the SAFO  or  Air  Force  element  commander  in  the  headquarters  staff  organization  at  the  next superior level  in  the joint  or combined force, if  any, or  the GCMCA for the Air Force unit responsible  for  providing  support  to  the  headquarters  staff  organization  under  AFI  25-201. The Air Force officer who acts on the appeal must at least be a field grade officer and higher   22  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 in grade to the officer who imposed the punishment. (T-0).  When the next superior authority is  not  at  least  a  field  grade  officer  and  higher  in  grade  to  the  SAFO  or  Air  Force  element commander  who  imposed  the  punishment,  or  when  the  SAFO  or  Air  Force  element commander  for  the  headquarters  staff  of  a  unified  command  imposed  the  punishment,  the AF/CV  is  the  "next  superior  authority,"  and  the  appeal  is  forwarded  directly  to AFLOA/JAJM. 4.2.6.  When  the  SAFO  or  Air  Force  element  commander  (whose  SAFO  is  unable  to  act under paragraph 4.2.4.1 and 4.2.4.2) of an activity outside the Air Force imposes punishment, the  "next  superior  authority"  is  the  Commander,  AFDW.  However,  if  the  Commander, AFDW, is not higher in grade to the SAFO or element commander who imposed punishment, the  AF/CV  is  the  "next  superior  authority"  and  the  appeal  is  forwarded  directly  to AFLOA/JAJM. 4.2.7.  When the commander of a MAJCOM, direct reporting unit, or field operating agency imposes punishment, SECAF has designated AF/CC as the appellate authority and authorized AF/CC to delegate this authority to AF/CV. Forward such appeals directly to AFLOA/JAJM. 4.2.8.  When  a  joint  force  commander,  including  an  Air  Force  officer  acting  in  his  or  her capacity  as  a  joint  force  commander,  imposes  punishment,  the  “next  superior  authority”  is the  next  superior  joint  force  commander.  When  the  commander  of  a  unified  command imposes punishment, or is otherwise disqualified from being the appellate authority, forward the appeal to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for appropriate action by the Secretary of  Defense  or  his  designee,  in  accordance  with  Joint  Publication  0-2.  The  SAFO  or commander of the member’s element notifies the servicing Air Force SJA of the appeal. The servicing SJA coordinates with the SJA or legal counsel who services the appellate authority to  explain  Air  Force  policy  and  procedures  for  NJP  and  to  advise  the  appellate  authority’s SJA  or  legal  counsel  that  collateral  decisions  and  processing  (such  as  AMJAMS  inputs, personnel and finance actions, and UIF and selection record entries) will be made within Air Force channels. 4.2.9.  When  a  multiservice  commander  in  a  combined  command,  combined  task  force,  or activity  outside  the  Air  Force  imposes  NJP  on  an  Air  Force  member,  the  next  superior authority  is  the  immediate  multiservice  commander  who  is  a  member  of  the  U.S.  Armed Forces  and  who  is  superior  to  the  imposing  commander,  if  any,  or  the  Air  Force  GCMCA with UCMJ authority over the Air Force member. However, if the next superior authority or GCMCA  is  junior  in  grade  to  the  imposing  commander,  the  AF/CV  is  the  "next  superior authority" and the appeal is forwarded directly to AFLOA/JAJM. 4.2.10.  When a unique command structure or situation exists, AFLOA/JAJM may designate another individual to act as the appellate authority. Applications for such designations shall be submitted to AFLOA/JAJM in writing through appropriate command channels. (T-1). 4.3.  Format.  Appeals  must  be  documented  on  the  AF  Form  3070.    (T-0).  No  right  or entitlement to a personal appearance before the appellate authority is provided. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 7c. 4.4.  Delegation of Authority.  If the "next superior authority" is a general officer or a GCMCA, that  individual  may  delegate  the  power  to  act  on  appeals  to  a  principal  assistant  in  the  manner described in paragraph 2.7. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   23  4.5.  Procedures for Appeals. 4.5.1.  Punishment  is  not  stayed  pending  appeal,  except  as  provided  in  MCM,  Part  V, paragraph 7d. 4.5.2.  At the time a commander informs the member of the punishment, the commander: 4.5.2.1.  Directs  the  member  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  punishment  and  right  to appeal  by  signing  item  5  of  the  AF  Form  3070  and  then  annotating  the  date  and  time signed. 4.5.2.1.1.  If the member refuses to acknowledge receipt of the punishment and rights to  appeal,  the  commander  will  note  in  item  5  "member  refused  to  acknowledge receipt of punishment and right to appeal" and initial. The time limit for appeal is still applicable despite the member's failure to sign the AF Form 3070. 4.5.2.2.  Informs  the  member  that  the  appeal  can  be  filed  anytime  within  five  calendar days.  (T-0). A decision not to appeal is final. 4.5.2.3.  Explains  that  if  an  appeal  is  not  filed  within  five  days,  appellate  rights  will  be waived.  The  commander  may  grant  an  extension  of  time  to  appeal  for  good  cause  and upon written application received within the five-day appeal period. 4.5.2.4.  Explains  to  the  member  that  any  documents  supporting  the  appeal  must  be submitted at the same time the member makes the appeal decision. 4.5.2.5.  Explains to the member that he or she is entitled to the advice of legal counsel in making the appeal decision. 4.5.3.  The  member  must  reflect  his  or  her  appeal  decision  by  initialing  only  one  block  in item  6a-c  of  the  AF  Form  3070,  signing  the  form,  and  then  annotating  the  date  and  time signed.  (T-3). Note:  Senior NCOs and officers must also initial the appropriate block in item 6d-e for matters pertaining to their selection record.  See paragraph 4.8. (T-3). 4.5.3.1.  The  member  makes  a  choice  between  not  appealing,  appealing  and  submitting matters in writing, or appealing and not submitting matters in writing. 4.5.3.2.  The appeal decision is a one-time decision made during the time limit for appeal explained in paragraph 4.5.2.2. All documents supporting the appeal must be submitted at the  same  time  as  the  appeal  decision.  (T-3).  If  the  member  decides  not  to  appeal,  the imposing commander makes the UIF determination in item 9 of the AF Form 3070 and continues  processing  the  NJP  action  in  accordance  with  Section  6B.  If  the  member decides to appeal, the imposing commander continues processing the appeal. 4.5.3.3.  The member's decision to appeal or not to appeal in item 6 of the AF Form 3070 ends the time limit  for appeal.  If the imposing  commander has not  acted on the appeal, the member may withdraw the appeal. Pen and ink changes should be made in item 6 of the AF Form 3070 to reflect the member's decision not to appeal. 4.5.3.4.  If the member refuses to sign his or her appeal decision within the time limit for appeal,  the  commander  will  note  in  item  6  of  the  AF  Form  3070  "member  refused  to make appeal decision within the time limit for appeal" and initial. The member's failure to respond in time is deemed a waiver of his or her right to appeal.   24  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 4.6.  Action on Appeal by Imposing Commander. 4.6.1.  The  imposing  commander  examines  the  written  matters  submitted,  if  any,  and  after consulting with the SJA, may grant the relief requested in whole or in part, by using his or her powers to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside the punishment. 4.6.2.  The  imposing  commander  records  his  or  her  decision  on  the  appeal  in  item  7  of  the AF  Form  3070  by  initialing  the  appropriate  block  and  signing  the  form.  If  the  imposing commander grants relief, he or she annotates the relief granted in item 14 as a continuation of item  7.  The  annotation  should  state  "As  the  commander  who  imposed  nonjudicial punishment,  I  grant  your  appeal  [(in  full)(in  part)]  as  follows:  (State  the  specific  relief granted)." If the commander grants full relief, do not forward the appeal.  If the commander grants less than the full relief requested, forward the appeal to the appellate authority. 4.6.3.  If  the  appeal  is  forwarded  to  the  appellate  authority,  the  imposing  commander  adds written comments  by indorsement through the servicing SJA (see MCM, Part V, paragraph 7e), addressing any contentions raised by the member. The imposing commander states in the forwarding indorsement whether the member has served any portion of the punishment. The imposing  commander  includes  in  the  package  all  written  materials  considered  in  imposing the punishment, including a summary of the member's oral presentation, if applicable, as well as a summary of any other information considered and its source. The indorsement may state the commander’s rationale for imposing punishment and a recommendation for action on the appeal. Since the indorsement includes deliberative process, the member is not entitled to a copy. 4.7.  Action  on  Appeal  by  Appellate  Authority.  The  appellate  authority  reviews  the  written material forwarded by the initiating commander and the legal review required by MCM, Part V, Section  7e.  The  legal  review  must  be  in  writing.  This  material  does  not  become  part  of  the permanent  record,  but  is  returned  to  the  SJA  for  filing.  The  appellate  authority  may  grant  the relief  requested  in  whole  or  in  part,  by  using  the  same  power  as  may  be  exercised  by  the imposing  commander  to  suspend,  mitigate,  remit,  or  set  aside  the  punishment.  The  appellate authority records his or her decision on the appeal in item 8 of the AF Form 3070 by initialing the appropriate block and signing the form. Relief granted (in full or in part) is recorded in item 14 as a continuation of item 8. Unless otherwise stated, relief granted as a result of an appeal is effective from the date the punishment was initially imposed. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 7f(1). If  all  punishment  is  disapproved,  the  entire  action  must  be  set  aside  and  removed  from  the member's record; an NJP action cannot consist of "no punishment." (T-0). 4.8.  Officer and Enlisted Selection Record Determination.  When the member is an officer or an enlisted member required to meet an evaluation board prior to being promoted, the imposing commander must decide whether to file the record of NJP in the member's selection record. (T-3).  Note:  The  ANG  does  not  utilize  SNCO  Selection  Records.  This  decision  is  made  after punishment  is  imposed  and  any  appeal  is  resolved.  Follow  the  procedures  in  AFI  36-2608, Military Personnel Records Systems. Also refer to AFI 36-2608 for filing records of vacation or supplemental  proceedings  (i.e.,  AF  Forms  366  and  3212).  The  GCMCA  SJA  shall simultaneously forward the final decision memorandum  regarding the selection record and any related correspondence (the commander's intent to file memorandum and individual statements, if  any)  with  the  original  record  of  NJP  for  inclusion  in  the  member's  master  personnel  record group in accordance with paragraph 6.8. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   25  4.8.1.  In  a  joint  or  combined  command  or  task  force,  if  an  officer  assigned  to  a  different service  imposed  NJP  on  an  Air  Force  member,  the  Air  Force  officer  identified  in  AFI  36-2608 must make the selection record filing decision. (T-3).   26  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 Chapter 5 SUPPLEMENTARY ACTIONS  Section 5A—Suspension, Mitigation, Remission, and Set Aside of Punishment 5.1.  General Guidance.  Use AF Form 3212 to record actions to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside punishment, unless such actions are accomplished as part of an appeal, which is governed by Chapter 4. 5.2.  Consultation Required.  Commanders must consult the servicing SJA before taking action to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside a previously imposed punishment. (T-3). A commander may  take  such  action  upon  his  or  her  own  initiative  or  upon  a  request  from  the  member. Members requesting such relief should use the sample format at Attachment 4. 5.3.  Action by Successor in Command.  A commander's power to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set  aside  NJP  passes  to  any  successor  in  command.  For  these  purposes,  the  successor  in command may be either: 5.3.1.  The officer who succeeded to the command or the position of the officer who imposed the punishment and who is authorized to impose on the member the punishment involved; or 5.3.2.  An  officer  authorized  to  impose  on  the  member  the  punishment  involved,  if  the member  has  been  reassigned.  If  the  successor  lacks  authority,  that  officer  forwards  the member's request to the next superior commander. MCM, Part V, paragraph 7f(1). 5.4.  Suspension.  See  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  6a.  Suspension  is  the  postponement  of  the application of all or part of the punishment for a specific probationary period, until  a specified date. It will be automatically remitted (canceled) at the end of that period if the member does not violate the condition(s) of suspension. Suspension is often warranted for a first offense or where persuasive extenuating or mitigating circumstances exist. 5.4.1.  A  commander  may,  at  any  time,  suspend  any  part  or  amount  of  the  unexecuted punishment  imposed.  An  executed  punishment  of  reduction  in  grade  or  forfeiture  may  be suspended, provided the suspension is accomplished within a period of four months after the date imposed. 5.4.2.  Suspension  of  punishment  may  not  be  for  a  period  longer  than  six  months  from  the date  the  suspension  was  imposed,  and  the  expiration  of  the  current  enlistment  or  term  of service of the member involved automatically terminates any period of suspension. However, six months may be longer than 180 days; for example, 1 July punishment suspended through 31 December. A suspension action will set a specific date after which, unless sooner vacated, the  suspension  will  terminate  and  the  punishment  will  be  remitted.  This  date  should  not exceed  the  member’s  expiration  of  term  of  service  (ETS)  at  the  time  suspension  action  is taken. 5.4.3.  When  reduction  in  grade  is  later  suspended,  the  member's  original  date  of  rank (DOR), held before the reduction, is reinstated. The effective DOR, however, is the date of the document directing the suspension. See AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   27  5.4.4.  Suspension  of  a  punishment  automatically  includes  a  condition  that  the  service member will not violate any punitive articles of the UCMJ. Commanders may specify other conditions as well, but shall consult with the SJA before imposing them. (T-3). Include any additional  conditions  of  suspension  within  the  punishment  indorsement.  The  additional condition(s)  upon  which  suspension  is  based  must  be  clearly  stated  and  capable  of  being completed during the period of suspension. (T-0).  See Attachment 4 for sample language. 5.4.5.  The  member,  if  undergoing  a  suspended  reduction  in  grade,  is  ineligible  for promotion,  including  testing  and  consideration  if  already  tested.  See  AFI  36-2502,  Airman Promotion  Program.  The  member,  if  serving  any  suspended  punishment,  is  ineligible  to reenlist, but may be eligible for an extension of enlistment. See AFI 36-2606, Reenlistment in the United States Air Force. 5.5.  Mitigation.  See  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  6b.  Mitigation  is  a  reduction  in  either  the quantity or quality of a punishment with its general nature remaining the same.  For example, a punishment of correctional custody for 20 days can be mitigated to correctional custody for 10 days or to restriction for 20 days. The first action lessens the quantity and the second lessens the quality,  with  both  mitigated  punishments  remaining  of  the  same  general  nature  as  correctional custody, that is, deprivation of liberty. However, a mitigation of 10 days correctional custody to 14 days restriction would not be permitted because the quantity has been increased. 5.5.1.  With the exception of reduction in  grade,  only the unexecuted part or amount of the punishment can be mitigated. 5.5.2.  A  reduction  in  grade,  whether  executed  or  unexecuted,  can  only  be  mitigated  to forfeitures. A reduction in grade will not be mitigated to a lesser reduction or no reduction. Mitigation  of  a  reduction  in  grade  must  be  done  within  four  months  after  the  date  of execution. (T-0).   When mitigating a reduction  in  grade to  forfeiture of  pay, the  amount of the forfeiture imposed may not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed by the officer who initially imposed the mitigated punishment. See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6b. If the reduction was executed, the DOR for the restored grade is the date of the indorsement mitigating  the  punishment.  For  example,  if  a  member  receives  Article  15  punishment consisting  of  a  reduction  in  grade  on  1  June,  and  on  1  July  the  commander  subsequently mitigates the reduction to a forfeiture, both the effective date and DOR for the restored grade is 1 July. See AFI 36-2604, Service Dates and Dates of Rank. 5.5.3.  A forfeiture of pay, to the extent to which it has not been executed, may be mitigated to a lesser forfeiture of pay, but cannot be mitigated to other forms of punishment. 5.5.4.  Restraints on liberty (such as arrest, correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction) may  not  be  mitigated  to  forfeitures  or  reduction  in  grade  because  the  general  nature  of  the punishment would be changed. Arrest in quarters can be mitigated to restriction; correctional custody can be mitigated to extra duties or restriction or both; extra duties can be mitigated to restriction; but restriction, being the least severe restraint on liberty, cannot be mitigated to a different  form  of  punishment.  Also,  when  a  restraint  on  liberty  is  mitigated,  the  lesser punishment may not run for a period greater than the remainder of the period for which the punishment mitigated was initially imposed. For example, when a person is given 15 days of correctional custody and has served five days of this punishment and correctional custody is mitigated to restriction, the mitigated punishment may not exceed restriction for a period of 10 days.   28  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 5.6.  Remission.  See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6c. Remission is simply the cancellation of any portion of the unexecuted punishment. An unsuspended reduction is  executed on imposition. It can,  therefore,  never  be  remitted,  but  under  appropriate  circumstances  may  be  suspended (paragraph 5.4), mitigated (paragraph 5.5), or set aside (paragraph 5.7). 5.7.  Set Aside.  See MCM, Part V, paragraph 6d. Set aside occurs when the punishment, or any part  or  amount  thereof,  whether  executed  or  unexecuted,  is  removed  from  the  record  and  any rights,  privileges,  pay,  or  property  affected  by  the  relevant  portion  of  the  punishment  are restored.  A  set  aside  of  all  punishment  voids  the  entire  nonjudicial  punishment  action.  A commander  may  not  set  aside  punishment  more  than  four  months  after  execution  of  the punishment, unless the commander determines unusual circumstances exist and explains them in an attachment to AF Form 3212. 5.7.1.  Set aside is not normally considered a rehabilitation tool, like suspension, remission, and mitigation. Commanders should not routinely set aside punishment, but should exercise this discretionary authority only in the rare and unusual case where a question concerning the guilt of the member arises or where the best interests of the Air Force are served by clearing the member's record. 5.7.2.  Setting  aside  a  punishment  in  its  entirety  restores  the  member  to  the  position  held before imposition of the punishment, as if the Article 15 action had never been initiated. For example,  if  a  member  has  been  reduced  in  grade  through  Article  15  punishment,  and  the reduction is later set aside, the effective date and DOR revert to that held before reduction. See AFI 36-2604. 5.8.  Limitations  on  Suspension,  Mitigation,  Remission  and  Set  Aside  of  Punishment.  A commander can suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, only if the commander has the authority to impose that punishment. For example, a commander in the grade of captain or lieutenant cannot suspend, mitigate, remit, or  set aside punishment imposed by a field grade commander beyond what the captain or lieutenant could impose. A commander not  empowered  to  act  may,  of  course,  recommend  suspending,  mitigating,  remitting,  or  setting aside an action to the next superior commander empowered to impose such punishment(s). 5.9.  Processing Requirements.  Process and file all requests to suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside  punishment,  and  any  actions  taken  in  response,  with  the  original  Article  15  record  and ensure inclusion with other official file copies. Section 5B—Vacation of Suspension 5.10.  General  Guidance.  Commanders must consult the servicing SJA before taking action to vacate  a  suspended  punishment.  (T-3).  A  commander  may  vacate  all  or  a  portion  of  the suspended  punishment.    Vacation  of  a  suspended  non-judicial  punishment  is  not  itself nonjudicial punishment, and additional action to impose nonjudicial punishment for a violation of  a  punitive  article  of  the  UCMJ  upon  which  the  vacation  action  is  based  is  not  precluded thereby.  MCM, Part V, paragraph 6a(5), provides further guidance on vacation actions. 5.11.  Notification  to  the  Member.  Except  when  prevented  by  unauthorized  absence  of  the member,  the  commander  completes  item  1  of the  AF  Form  366,  signs  and  dates  the  form,  and causes the member to be notified and advised of his or her rights, using the form. Normally, the commander  notifies  and  serves  the  member,  then  signs  and  annotates  the  date  and  time  the AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   29  member  was  served  notice  of  the  proceeding  in  item  2  of  the  AF  Form  366.  Where circumstances prevent  the commander  from  personally notifying and serving the AF Form  366 on the member or the commander elects not to do so, the commander may direct a subordinate, senior  in  rank  to  the  member  (when  practicable),  to  notify  and  serve  the  member.  The subordinate annotates the date and time of service and signs in item 2 of the AF Form 366 as the person serving the member. Regardless of who serves the member, provide the member with a copy  of  both  pages  of  the  AF  Form  366.  Make  available  to  the  member  all  statements  and evidence upon which the commander intends to rely in making his or her decision. 5.11.1.  The  servicing  SJA  provides  a  description  of  the  basis  for  the  vacation  (i.e., misconduct or failure to meet an additional condition upon which the suspension was based) and other information pertinent to the suspended punishment on the AF Form 366. 5.11.2.  If a new commander assumes responsibility for the case after a vacation proceeding has  been  initiated,  but  before  the  vacation  decision  is  made,  inform  the  member  of  the identity  of  the  new  commander  and  provide  three  duty  days  to  present  matters.  The  new commander accomplishes this either by notifying the member about the change in writing or by withdrawing the old AF Form 366 and initiating a new vacation proceeding on a new AF Form 366. If the notification format is used, it becomes an attachment to the AF Form 366. 5.11.3.  Notification of proceedings to vacate suspended NJP may be provided to officers by the  commander  who  originally  recommended  that  another  commander  punish  the  member under  Article  15,  UCMJ  (e.g.,  the  Wing/CC  who  recommended  the  NAF/CC  punish  the member).  This  notification  can be provided by  modifying the AF Form  366 to  include the statement, “Upon receipt of your presentation, if any, the decision to vacate your punishment will be made by [Name/Rank of CC].” 5.11.4.  The member may present matters in defense, extenuation, or mitigation regarding the violation on which the vacation action is based. 5.11.5.  The member may make either a written presentation or personal appearance or both. If the member elects to make a personal appearance, he or she may personally appear before the  commander  authorized  to  vacate  suspension  of  the  nonjudicial  punishment.  If  such  an appearance is impracticable due to the unavailability of the commander or by extraordinary circumstances, the member may  appear before  a person designated by the commander who will  prepare  a  summary  of  the  personal  appearance  for  the  commander.  At  the  personal appearance, the member may (a) present evidence; (b) present witnesses who are reasonably available;  and  (c)  be  accompanied  by  someone  to  speak  on  his  or  her  behalf.  There  is  no requirement  that  a  lawyer  be  made  available  to  accompany  the  member  at  the  personal appearance. 5.12.  Member’s  Elections.  The  member  has  three  duty  days  to  make  his  elections.  The member  must  initial  in  item  3  of  the  AF  Form  366  whether  or  not  the  member  consulted  a lawyer,  attached  a  written  presentation,  or  requested  a  personal  appearance  before  the commander. (T-3).  The commander may, upon written application, grant an extension for good cause. 5.12.1.  If  a  member  does  not  reply  with  his  or  her  elections  in  time,  the  commander  may continue  with  the  proceedings  and  note  in  item  3  of  AF  Form  366  "member  failed  to respond"  and  initial.  The  member's  failure  to  respond  in  time  does  not  prevent  the   30  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 commander from continuing with the vacation proceedings. However, if the commander has reason to believe a failure to respond resulted from reasons beyond that individual's control, the commander may not, without good cause, proceed with vacation proceedings. 5.13.  Timing.  Vacation  of  a  suspension  must  be  based  on  the  violation  of  the  condition(s)  of the suspension and occur within the period of suspension. (T-0). See paragraph 5.4.4. To vacate a suspension, the commander must present  the member with  the AF  Form  366 before the  end of the  suspension  period.  (T-0).  The  suspension  period  is  stayed  if  the  probationer  has  been properly  notified  via  AF  Form  366  during  the  suspension  period.  The  member's  unauthorized absence also interrupts the suspension period. For example, if a member is absent without leave for 10 days, the period of suspension is extended 10 days. 5.14.  Commander's Decision. 5.14.1.  Following  full  and  fair  consideration  of  the  evidence,  including  any  matters presented by the member, the commander indicates one of the following actions in item 4a of the AF Form 366 by marking or initialing the appropriate block on the form: 5.14.1.1.  The  vacation  proceedings  are  terminated  because  vacation  of  the  suspended punishment is not appropriate or because the member did not violate the condition(s) of the suspension. 5.14.1.2.  The  member  violated  one  or  more  of  the  conditions  of  the  suspension.  The commander  lines  out  and  initials  any  violations  for  which  vacation  of  the  suspended punishment is not appropriate or which the member did not violate. 5.14.2.  The commander completes item 4 of the AF Form 366 and signs and dates the form in the indicated blocks. 5.14.2.1.  If the commander terminates the proceedings, the original AF Form 366 is sent to  the  servicing  SJA  for  appropriate  AMJAMS  entries.  The  AF  Form  366  is  then destroyed. 5.14.2.2.  Punishment  is  recorded  in  item  9  of  the  AF  Form  366  as  a  continuation  of 4.a(2). 5.14.3.  At  the  time  a  commander  informs  the  member  of  the  vacation  decision,  the commander  directs  the  member  to  acknowledge  the  action  taken  on  the  proceedings  of vacation of suspended nonjudicial punishment and that there is no right to appeal by signing and dating item 5 of the AF Form 366. 5.14.3.1.  If  the  member  refuses  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  vacation  action,  the commander  will  note  in  item  5  "member  refused  to  acknowledge  receipt  of  vacation action" and initial. 5.15.  Effect  on  Suspended  Reductions.  If  a  reduction  in  grade  is  suspended,  but  the suspension is later vacated, the DOR in the grade to which the member is reduced is the date the original  reduction  was  imposed  by  the  commander.  The  effective  date,  however,  is  the  date  of the  vacation  action.  See  AFI  36-2604.  For  example,  if  the  commander  imposed  Article  15 punishment  consisting  of  a  suspended  reduction  in  grade  for  six  months  on  1  June,  and  the commander  subsequently  vacates  the  suspension  on  2  September,  the  effective  date  of  the reduction  is  2  September,  but  the  member's  new  DOR  is  1  June.  Pay  is  not  retroactively recouped. AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   31  Chapter 6 MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS Section 6A—Indorsing Forms and Correspondence 6.1.  Procedure.  Prepare  any  indorsements  to  AF  Form  3070  using  normal  correspondence practices.  Send  the  correspondence  involved  in  processing  NJP  (including  prescribed  forms) through command channels, except as provided in paragraph 6.8. Unless specifically prescribed, each intermediate commander decides whether to add matters of substance by indorsement. If so, they are signed as noted below. 6.2.  Content of Indorsements: 6.2.1.  Any  intermediate  commander  or  delegee  may  recommend  action  or  provide  other information that might help the superior commander in arriving at a decision. 6.2.2.  Following actions by appropriate authority, any intermediate commander, delegee, or staff  officer  signing  under information  (including administrative instructions) to the member or to a subordinate commander by indorsement. line  may  furnish the  authority 6.3.  Copies.  Copies of Article 15 documentation are reproduced from the signed original. The SJA  ensures  copies  of  all  documents  and  attachments  that  will  comprise  the  record  of punishment,  as  set  forth  in  paragraph  6.11,  are  provided  to  the  member  and  to  each  level  of command involved. Section 6B—Action Taken on Records of Punishment, Including Vacation, Suspension, Mitigation and Set Aside Actions 6.4.  Action  by  the  Commander.  The  commander  who  imposed  the  punishment  or  who  took action to vacate, suspend, mitigate, remit, or set aside, sends the record to the servicing SJA for review, comment, and recommendation, as appropriate. 6.4.1.  If  the  punishment  includes  unsuspended  correctional  custody,  the  commander immediately  notifies  the  correctional  custody  monitor  of  the  details,  including  inclusive dates, to begin the punishment. 6.4.2.  Before sending the AF Form 3070 to the servicing SJA, but after completing all other action, including appeal, the commander imposing punishment indicates in item 9 (for AB – TSgt)  or  item  10  (for  Senior  NCOs)  whether  the  NJP  record  will  be  filed  in  an  enlisted member's  UIF  by  initialing,  signing  and  dating  the  appropriate  block.  The  imposing commander  should  make  this  determination  even  in  cases  that  were  appealed.  However,  if the  imposing  commander  is  not  available,  any  person  authorized  by  AFI  36-2907, Unfavorable  Information  File  (UIF)  Program,  may  make  the  UIF  determination.    UIFs  are mandatory for officers who receive NJP, which is noted in item 9 of the AF Form 3070C. 6.4.2.1.  It  is  within  the  commander’s  discretion  to  provide  the  member  with  an opportunity  to  respond  to  the  UIF  decision,  regardless  of  whether  the  entry  of  the  NJP record in the UIF is mandatory or optional.   32  AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015 6.4.2.2.  In  a  joint  or  combined  command  or  task  force,  if  an  officer  assigned  to  a different service imposed NJP on an Air Force member, the Air Force officer identified in AFI 36-2907 must make the UIF decision. 6.4.2.3.  The member acknowledges that he or she was informed about the commander's UIF,  selection  record,  and  appeal  decisions,  as  applicable,  by  signing  and  dating  the “Member’s  Acknowledgement”  block  on  the  AF  Form  3070.  If  the  member  refuses  to sign, the commander will note "member refused to sign" in this block and initial. 6.5.  Action by the Servicing SJA.  The SJA or designated attorney reviews the NJP action for legal  sufficiency  if  no  appeal  is  taken,  or  after  the  member  acknowledges  action  on  the  appeal and  the  imposing  commander  returns  the  record  to  the  servicing  SJA.  The  reviewing  attorney signs  and  dates  the  “Servicing  SJA  Legal  Review”  block  of  the  AF  Form  3070  (or  of  the  AF Form 366 or 3212, when applicable) when the record is found legally sufficient. The NJP action is  final  at  that  point  and  admissible  in  courts-martial  for  purposes  of  RCM  1001(b)(2).  This  is also the final action for purposes of the timeliness metric as recorded in AMJAMS. In officer and senior NCO cases, the commander must make a decision regarding selection record processing and  UIF  action,  and  the  member  must  acknowledge  that  he  or  she  has  been  informed  of  these decisions before completing the servicing SJA legal review. (T-3). 6.5.1.  The SJA then sends: 6.5.1.1.  One  copy  of  the  record  to  the  officer  who  supervises  the  correctional  custody program when the case involves unsuspended correctional custody. 6.5.1.2.  Two copies of the record, with an AF Form 1373, MPO Document Control Log-Transmittal,  to  the  Accounting  and  Finance  Office  (AFO)  if  the  punishment  affects  the member's pay. The SJA keeps a copy of the AF Form 1373. The person who provided the copies  of  the  record  to  AFO  will  date  and  initial  the  appropriate  part  of  the  “MPF  and AFO  Distribution”  block  of  the  AF  Form  3070  (or  of  the  AF  Form  366  or  3212,  when applicable) or mark "N/A" if not applicable. 6.5.1.3.  One  copy  of  the  record  to  the  unit  UIF  monitor  if  the  record  will  be  filed  in  a UIF.  The unit UIF monitor is responsible for ensuring entry into a UIF. See AFI 36-2907 for detailed procedures. 6.5.1.4.  One  copy  of  the  record  to  the  servicing  MPF,  with  an  AF  Form  1373,  in  all cases. The SJA keeps a copy of the AF Form 1373. The person who provided the copy of the  record  to  MPF  will  date  and  initial  the  appropriate  part  of  the  “MPF  and  AFO Distribution”  block  of  the  AF  Form  3070  (or  of  the  AF  Form  366  or  3212,  when applicable). 6.5.1.5.  The  original  record  (and  two  complete  copies  for  officer  cases)  directly  to  the SJA for the officer exercising general court-martial convening authority, after providing the record to the MPF and AFO and noting the date of receipt. File the receipted copy of AF Form 1373 as prescribed in paragraph 6.12. 6.5.1.6.  In  cases  involving  O-6  selects  and  above,  one  copy  of  the  record  and  all supporting documents to the member's commander for forwarding IAW AFI 90-301. See paragraph  1.5.  In  all  cases  where  the  incident  was  investigated  by  Air  Force  Office  of AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   33  Special Investigations or Security Forces, provide the investigating office with sufficient information on final disposition to fulfill their respective reporting requirements. 6.6.  Action  by  the  Military  Personnel  Flight  (MPF).  The  MPF,  on  receiving  the  record, acknowledges receipt on a copy of the AF Form 1373, returns this form to the servicing SJA and takes appropriate personnel actions. 6.7.  Action  by  the  GCMCA  SJA.  The  GCMCA  SJA  or  designated  attorney  performs  an administrative  supervisory  review  on  behalf  of  the  GCMCA  and  returns  legally  deficient proceedings  for  correction.  The  reviewing  attorney  signs  and  dates  the  “GCMCA  SJA Administrative  Supervisory  Review”  block  of  the  AF  Form  3070  (or  of  the  AF  Form  366  or 3212, when applicable) when the record is in compliance with AFI 51-202 and sends a copy of it to the servicing SJA. Section 6C—Filing of the Original Record on Nonjudical Punishment Proceedings 6.8.  Procedures.  The GCMCA SJA sends the original NJP action to one of the addresses listed in paragraphs 6.8.1 through 6.8.4 for filing in the master personnel record group. In officer and senior NCO cases, simultaneously forward the original memorandum regarding the final decision to file or not file the NJP action in the selection record, including required attachments, with the original NJP action. See paragraph 4.8. 6.8.1.  For  Active  Duty  Members  and  Reservists  on  Extended  Active  Duty  (as  defined  in Attachment 1): 6.8.1.1.

The  Office  of  the  Chief  Counsel  serves  as  a  central  collection  point  for these  actions  and  will  notify  the  specific  State  Adjutant  General  concerned  and  will determine ultimate disposition of the record. 6.8.4.  For  cases  involving  USAFA  Cadets,  send  all  records  to  HQ  USAFA/DPY,  2360 Vandenberg Drive, Suite 3C24, USAF Academy, CO 80840-8720, for inclusion in section 3 of  the  CPR-1.  Upon  commissioning,  these  records  will  be  forwarded  to  the  officer  master personnel  record  group,  AFPC/DPSRI1,  550  C  Street  West,  Suite  21,  Joint  Base  San Antonio-Randolph, TX 78150-4723. 6.8.5.  Article 15 correspondence relating to Air Force members for offenses that occur while on  INACTIVE  duty  for  training  (IDT)  and  UTA  must  be  processed  through  Air  Force Reserve Command (AFRC) legal channels to HQ AFRC. Section 6D—Effect of Errors in Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings 6.9.  Effect  of  Errors.  See  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  1h.  An  NJP  proceeding  is  not  legally sufficient  if  it  contains  an  error  that  materially  prejudices  a  substantial  right  of  the  member.  If such  an  error  exists  and  cannot  be  remedied  within  the  same  proceeding,  the  appropriate  NJP authority sets aside the defective NJP action. A new action may be initiated but any punishment imposed  as  a  result  of  an  additional  proceeding  may  be  no  more  severe  than  that  originally imposed.  See  MCM,  Part  V,  paragraph  7f(3).  If  a  material  error  exists  and  can  be  remedied within  the  same  proceeding  without  prejudicing  the  member's  rights,  reflect  the  correction, whenever  possible,  as  a  pen  and  ink  change  on  the  form  (i.e.,  AF  Forms  3070,  366  or  3212) initialed and dated by the commander and the member. However, if a pen and ink  change will not  result  in  a  clear  and  unambiguous  corrected  record,  the  commander,  by  indorsement  to  the form, should notify the member of the error and thoroughly explain the correction to the record.  The  member  signs  an  acknowledgment  to  the  commander's  indorsement.  The  indorsement  and acknowledgment become an attachment to the form. 6.9.1.  Administrative  or  clerical  errors  and  minor  errors  that  do  not  materially  prejudice  a substantial right of a member do not require correction to make the NJP proceeding legally sufficient.  However,  such  errors  may  be  corrected  with  pen  and  ink  changes  in  the  manner described above. Section 6E—Disposition of Records of Nonjudicial Punishment Proceedings 6.10.  Governing  Directive.  The  disposition  of  records  of  NJP  is  governed  by  the  Air  Force Records at https://www.my.af.mil/afrims/afrims/afrims/rims.cfm. Legal offices are authorized to destroy Disposition located Schedule (RDS) AFI51-202  31 MARCH 2015   35  copies of NJP records after three years, or when no longer needed, whichever is later. See RDS, Table 51-3, Rule 27. 6.11.  Contents  of  Record.  The  record  of  punishment  consists  of  the  AF  Form  3070,  the decision  letter  under  AFI  36-2608,  Military  Personnel  Records  System,  and  if  applicable,  AF Forms 366, 3212, and any of their attachments.
