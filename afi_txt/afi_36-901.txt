Overview.  This instruction establishes guidance and procedures for the administration and management  of  the  Air  Force  Civilian  Senior  Executive  (CSE)  resources.    The  Air  Force centrally  manages  the  CSE  resources  in  accordance  with  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements under  authorities  granted  by  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD).    The  CSE  resources  include:  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES  -  Career,  Non-Career  (NC)  and  Limited  Term);  Defense Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service  (DISES);  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Level  (DISL); Senior  Level  (SL);  Scientific  and  Professional  (ST);  Presidential  Appointee  with  Senate  (PAS) confirmation  and  Highly  Qualified  Expert  (HQE)  positions  assigned  to  the  Air  Force.    This instruction is to be used in conjunction with the policies and guidance issued by OPM, including related regulations, and other Air Force Instructions (AFIs) in the Personnel series. 1.2.  Retained Authority.  Air Force Senior Executive Management Office (AFSEMO) through the  Executive  Resources  Board  (ERB)  establishes  policies  on  SES/DISES/DISL/SL/ST/HQE position  management,  requirements,  classification,  recruitment,  selection,  salary,  bonuses, authorizes use of position allocations, evaluates current and projected use of positions to assure proper use of resources, and retains these authorities for these positions. (NC)  Senior  Executive  Service 1.2.1.  Non-Career (SES)  Members.  AFSEMO administers classification and review, and performance management for  NC SES  members.  All other NC SES administrative and management matters are managed by the Office of the Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force,  Human  Resources  Directorate (SAF/AAA).  SAF/AAA performs these processes through delegation from the Secretary of the  Air  Force  (SECAF)  and  the  Administrative  Assistant  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force (SAF/AA),  in  accordance  with  DoD  Directive  5105.76,  Transition  of  Administration Appointees and Other Officials. 1.2.2.  Presidential  Appointee  with  Senate  (PAS)  confirmation.  All  PAS  administrative and  management  matters  are  managed  by  SAF/AAA.    SAF/AAA  performs  these  processes through  delegation  from  the  SECAF  and  SAF/AA,  in  accordance  with  DoD  Directive 5105.76, Transition of Administration Appointees and Other Officials. 1.3.  Position Types. 1.3.1.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES).  The  SES  is  a  "third"  service  and  is  completely separate  from  the  Competitive  Service  (e.g.,  Civil  Service  positions  filled  by  competitive examination  resulting  in  Career  tenure)  and  the  Excepted  Service  (e.g.,  Civil  Service positions  exempted  from  competitive  examination  by  either  law  or  administrative  action because it is impossible or impractical to conduct an appropriate examination).  The SES is a collective  corps  whose  members  have  solid  executive  skills,  public  service  values  and  a broad  perspective  of  Government.    The  SES  incorporates  civilian  managerial,  supervisory and policy positions above General Schedule (GS) grade 15 (or equivalent) that are not filled by a PAS confirmation, nor filled by NC SES members and whose pay does not exceed level II  of  the  Executive  Schedule  (ES).    There  are  two  types  of  Career  SES  positions:    General and Career Reserved.   6  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 1.3.1.1.  A General position may be filled by a Career, NC, or Limited Term appointee.  The same General position may be filled by a Career appointee at one time and by a NC or Limited Term appointee at another time. 1.3.1.2.  A  Career  Reserved  position  must  always  be  filled  by  a  Career  appointee.    A position is designated Career Reserved when a Career employee must fill the position to ensure impartiality or the public’s confidence in the impartiality of the Government. 1.3.2.  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service  (DISES).  These  managerial, supervisory  and  policy  positions  are  equivalent  to  SES  positions  and  are  in  the  Excepted Service.    These  positions  may  be  filled  through  permanent  or  nonpermanent  appointments under the Defense Civilian Intelligence Personnel System appointing authority. 1.3.3.  Non-Career  (NC)  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES).  These  appointments  do  not require merit staffing procedures, and appointees do not acquire SES career status.  There is no  time  limit  on  an  NC  SES  appointment,  but  the  individual  serves  at  the  pleasure  of  the appointing official. 1.3.4.  Senior  Level  (SL)  and  Scientific  and  Professionals  (STs).  The  SL/ST  positions  generally  cover  similar  responsibilities  as  the  SES/DISES,  but  are  non-managerial  (i.e., performing  research  and  development  functions  in  the  case  of  ST).    They  are  in  either  the Competitive  Service  or  the  Excepted  Service.    SL/ST  members  may  supervise  immediate administrative support staff only.  Any exceptions must be approved by the ERB. 1.3.5.  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Level  (DISL).  A  functional/technical  expert  who  is  a recognized  leader  and  authority  in  a  specialist  field  or  functional  area.    The  difficulty, complexity and novelty of DISL work requires creativity, mastery of the subject-matter field and  recognition  by  the  professional  community.    These  positions  do  not  have  the organizational  or  program  management  responsibilities  appropriate  for  the  DISES.    The DISL positions are classifiable above grade GS-15 (or equivalent) and are equivalent to the SL/ST  positions.    These  positions  are  in  the  Excepted  Service.    DISL  members  may supervise immediate administrative support staff only.  Any exceptions must be approved by the ERB. 1.3.6.  Highly  Qualified  Experts  (HQEs).  Senior-level  Excepted  Service  employees.  HQEs are experts possessing specialized knowledge or skills not readily available within the Air Force.  HQE administrative and management matters are managed by AFSEMO.  HQE guidance is addressed separately in chapter 10 of this AFI. 1.4.  Roles and Responsibilities. 1.4.1.  Department of Defense (DoD).  Establishes Department-wide executive management policies within the overall DoD policy framework.  DoD allocates positions and provides the Air  Force  with  the  authority,  control  and  flexibility  needed  to  accomplish  the  Air  Force strategic goals and mission. 1.4.2.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Allocates  SES/SL/ST  authorizations  to DoD  which,  in  turn,  sub-allocates  to  the  Air  Force.    The  Office  of  the  Under  Secretary  of Defense Intelligence [OUSD(I)] allocates DISES/DISL authorizations.  These positions must meet both the executive and professional grade level criteria prescribed in statute.  An agency AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   7  cannot  fill  a  position  in  an  executive  or  professional  position  without  an  authorized allocation. 1.4.3.  Air  Force  Senior  Executive  Management  Office  (AFSEMO).  AFSEMO manages the CSE allocation process on behalf of the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF).  Allocation and appointment actions are staffed through the ERB Chair to the SECAF for final approval in a biennial requirements survey.  Out-of-cycle requests are ranked against any existing or unfilled  requirements  to  prioritize  Air  Force  needs  and  may  require  a  reallocation  of resources from DoD.  As there are a limited number of executive resources available, the Air Force  analyzes  new  requests  for  CSE  positions  to  assure  allocations  are  used  in  the  most effective and efficient means. 1.4.4.  Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF).  Approves all Air Force CSE resource policies and procedures as the authorizing official, and retains full responsibility for the management of Air Force CSE resources. 1.4.5.  Executive Resources Board (ERB).  Appointed by the SECAF to fulfill Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), statutory and regulatory requirements.  The ERB consists of a Chair, Alternate Chair and other Tier 3 Career SES members appointed by the SECAF.  The ERB responsibilities include, but are not limited to the following: 1.4.5.1.  Meet  at  least  semi-annually  to  provide  Air  Force-wide  leadership,  policy direction and oversight on CSE resources. 1.4.5.2.  Review CSE appointments, reassignments, allocation requests, and position tier upgrades etc. 1.4.5.3.  Perform other taskings as determined appropriate by the SECAF. 1.4.6.  Talent  Management  Board  (TMB).  Appointed  to  ensure  Career  SES/DISES member  continuity  and  assist  AFSEMO  in  succession  planning  to  include  an  annual assessment of incumbents and positions to help determine future SES/DISES resource needs.  The  intent  is  to  have  potential  candidates  identified,  in  order  to  fill  critical  positions  in  a timely manner.  This is a strategic planning board that does not operate as a promotion board. 1.4.7.  Performance Review Board (PRB).  Appointed to ensure the quality and consistency of the performance appraisal process across the Air Force.  The PRB ensures balance, equity, and fairness in the evaluation and scoring process for CSEs under the performance appraisal system  and  ensures  there  are  meaningful  distinctions  in  the  Air  Force  performance requirements. 1.4.8.  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  2-Letter  (Ltr)  Officials/Major  Command (MAJCOM)/Combatant  Command  Commanders.  Coordinate with AFSEMO on overall management of the CSE resources assigned to their organizations.  Handle day-to-day issues, except disciplinary actions, regarding CSE matters within their organizations.   8  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 Chapter 2 CLASSIFICATION AND REVIEW 2.1.  Retained Authority. 2.1.1.  The  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF).  Establishes  policies  on  CSE  position management  and  retains  the  following  authorities  for  CSE  positions  (Note:    This  chapter does not apply to PAS members and HQEs): 2.1.1.1.  Approves  Air  Force  CSE  position  requirements  and  requests  Office  of  the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and OPM approval of the number of CSE positions allocated to the Air Force.  The allocations for DISES/DISL positions are provided by OUSD(I). 2.1.1.2.  Evaluates  current  and  projected  use  of  CSE  positions  to  assure  proper  use  of resources. 2.1.2.  HAF  2-ltr  officials/MAJCOM/Combatant  Commanders  can  submit  requests  for positions,  on  behalf  of  their  organizations,  to  AFSEMO  for  ERB  recommendation  and SECAF approval. 2.1.3.  AFSEMO,  through  the  ERB,  establishes  policies  on  CSE  position  management, requirements,  classification,  authorizes  use  of  position  allocations,  evaluates  current  and projected use of positions to assure proper use of resources. 2.2.  Civilian  Senior  Executive  (CSE)  Allocations.  Position  allocation  requests  are  submitted for  SECAF  approval.    New  requirements  for  CSE  allocations  should  be  for  positions  of  the highest priority that support the Air Force’s warfighting requirements or are due to Presidential mandate  or  legislative  requirements.    Submit  the  justification  in  the  format  specified  in Attachment 2. 2.3.  Establishing  Civilian  Senior  Executive  (CSE)  Positions.  After a position allocation has been approved, requesting officials must submit the following documentation to AFSEMO: 2.3.1.  Organizational  Charts.  The organizational chart(s) should show where the position is  located  and  the  chain  of  command  reporting  relationships  up  to  the  HAF  2-ltr  official/ MAJCOM/Combatant Commander level.  SES/DISES members can serve above and below general  officers  (GOs),  and  DISL/SL/ST  members  serve  below  SES/DISES/GOs  in  a  line command structure. 2.3.2.  Position Description (PD).  Prepare the PD in the format specified in Attachment 3.  AFSEMO provides assistance to organizations on the preparation of the PD.   For previously approved PDs, minor adjustments, including modifications to duty titles, may be documented in  pen  and  ink  changes  and  submitted  with  a  cover  letter,  signed  by  the  supervisor.      All changes  to  CSE  PDs  are  submitted  to  AFSEMO  with  any  necessary  documentation  stating the reason for the change. 2.3.3.  Justification  Criteria.  Justification  criteria  applies  to  SES/DISES  positions  only.  For each proposed new or revised PD, submit the justification criteria documentation in the format specified in Attachment 4.  Include the classification rationale as to why the position exceeds  grade  GS-15  (or  equivalent)  and  address  how  the  position  meets  the  SES/DISES AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   9  criteria.  The immediate supervisor of the position must be an SES/DISES, higher civilian or a GO. 2.3.4.  Evaluation  Statement.  The  evaluation  statement  provides  an  analysis  for  the position  to  exceed  grade  GS-15  (or  equivalent)  and  addresses  how  the  position  meets  the appropriate CSE criteria.  The evaluation statement is completed by an AFSEMO classifier. 2.4.  Biennial  Requirements  Survey.  Every other year, AFSEMO announces the deadline and documentation requirements for the survey of CSE requirements for the next Fiscal Year (FY).  During the biennial review, supervisors review all current CSE PDs for currency and accuracy. 2.4.1.  OPM  authorizes,  biennially,  the  number  of  SES/SL/ST  positions  for  each  agency; while  OUSD(I)  authorizes  the  number  of  DISES/DISL  positions.    The  ERB,  with  final approval from the SECAF, assigns CSE authorizations allocated to the Air Force.  AFSEMO notifies organizations of the results of the biennial survey. 2.4.2.  Out-of-Cycle  Requests.  Air  Force  organizations  may  request  new  CSE  resources whenever the need arises.  However, they must explain why the need was not  addressed in the  biennial  survey  and  must  include  the  documentation  specified  in  Attachment  2.    CSE allocations may not always be available to meet even high priority out-of-cycle requirements.  The SECAF retains final approval authority. 2.5.  Precedence Priority Codes and Position Tiers.  OSD periodically publishes updates to the Order of Precedence list, which provides the relative protocol precedence for CSEs within DoD. 2.5.1.  CSEs are not stratified by grade; therefore, position and pay structure distinctions for CSEs  necessitates  order  of  precedence.    For  protocol  purposes,  order  of  precedence  is accomplished in the Air Force through Distinguished Visitor (DV) codes. 2.5.2.  Distinguished Visitor (DV) Codes.  DV code designations are used to determine the order  of  precedence  for  official  visits  and  activities,  assignment  of  quarters,  seating  and travel status on Government aircraft and surface transportation for GO, Flag Officer (FO) or staff  of  equivalent  rank.    DV  code  designations  are  based  on  placement  and  level  of responsibility for the Air Force position.  The DV codes are assigned to positions, not people.  The DV code for the position may be equal to, or lower than the DV code of the supervisor’s position.    In  addition,  each  CSE  position  is  placed  in  one  of  three  tiers.    Position  tiers distinguish  position  levels  and  pay  distinctions.    The  relationship  of  the  DV  code  to  the GO/FO hierarchy and the existing three tiers are as follows: 2.5.2.1.  DV-4 /Tier 3 is equivalent  to  a three-star GO/FO.  A typical  DV-4 is  Principal Deputy  Assistant  Secretary,  the  Administrative  Assistant,  an  Assistant  Deputy  Chief  of Staff or Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) Executive Director. 2.5.2.2.  DV-5  /Tier  2  is  equivalent  to  a  two-star  GO/FO.    A  typical  DV-5  is  Deputy Assistant Secretary, Deputy General Counsel. 2.5.2.3.  DV-6 /Tier 1 is equivalent to a one-star GO/FO.  The minimum DV code for all CSEs  is  DV-6.    For  protocol  purposes,  SL/ST/DISL/HQEs  are  given  a  designation  of DV-6.    If  the  HQE  is  a  retired  Uniformed  Service  member,  consideration  is  given  to retired rank, whichever is higher.   10  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 2.5.2.4.  DV  codes  for  CSEs  above  DV-4  are  generally  reserved  for  Executive  Level (EX)  positions.    The  DV-2/DV-3  is  equivalent  to  a  four  star  GO/FO.    The  DV-2  is  the SECAF;  and  DV-3  is  the  Under  Secretary,  Assistant  Secretary  to  the  SECAF,  General Counsel and other Presidential appointments that require Senate confirmation. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   11  Chapter 3 RECRUITMENT AND SELECTION 3.1.  Recruitment  Process.  AFSEMO  conducts  an  extensive,  systematic  and  competitive recruitment process  for CSE appointments.  The process must be in full compliance with merit principles,  free  from  any  prohibited  personnel  practice,  and  must  meet  the  requirements  of29 CFR 1607, Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.  The recruitment process is outlined  below  and  in  Attachment  5.    Note:    This  chapter  does  not  apply  to  PAS,  NC  SES members and HQEs.  HQE recruitment and selection guidance is addressed separately in Chapter 10 of this AFI. 3.1.1.  Vacancy  Announcements.  All  Air  Force  CSE  vacancies  that  will  be  filled  with initial  Career  appointment  are  listed  on  the  OPM  Government-wide  automated  vacancy announcement  system.    Applicants  can  access  the  information  at  the  OPM  web  site (http://www.opm.gov). 3.1.2.  Recruitment Area.  The recruitment area is not limited to the Air Force or those with competitive  status.    The  Air  Force  considers  all  applicants  who  demonstrate  the  required qualifications.  In addition to general recruitment efforts, targeted recruitment of candidates with specialized skills is utilized for hard-to-fill positions. 3.1.3.  Senior Executive Service (SES) and Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (DISES)  Qualifications.    OPM  has  developed  Executive  Core  Qualifications  (ECQs)  that represent  the critical  skills  that all SES  members need in  order to  succeed today  and in  the future.  Although OPM does not administer the DISES positions, the Air Force does utilize the  same  standard  SES  criteria  for  DISES  appointments.    OPM  guidance  on  ECQs  can  be accessed at the OPM web site (http://www.opm.gov). 3.1.4.  Senior  Level  (SL),  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Level  (DISL),  and  Scientific  and Professional  (ST)  Member  Qualifications.  Candidates  must  have  at  least  three  years  of specialized  experience  at  grade  GS-15  (or  equivalent)  that  demonstrates  significant contributions, stature and professional reputation. 3.2.  Selection  Process.  AFSEMO  is  responsible  for  facilitating  the  entire  selection  process, including  the  Rating  and  Ranking  Panel,  interview  process,  providing  the  certificate  of  Best Qualified candidate(s) to the selecting official, facilitating the ERB case processing and staffing recommendations  for  SECAF  approval  and  Qualifications  Review  Board  (QRB)  approval  (if applicable). 3.2.1.  Rating  and  Ranking  Panel.  This  panel  meets  to  rate  and  rank  the  CSE  applicants.  The panel determines which applicants are Not Qualified, Qualified, or Best Qualified. 3.2.2.  Rating and Ranking Panel Membership Composition. 3.2.2.1.  Three  to  five  SES/GO  (or  equivalent)  members.    In  assembling  the  panel, consideration should be given to the diversity of the members, including all aspects of the Air  Force  definition  of  diversity.      When  filling  an  SL/ST/DISL  position,  the  panel membership may include SL/ST/DISL members.  The panel membership must meet the following criteria:   12  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 3.2.2.1.1.  Panel  Chair.    The  Panel  Chair  is  a  Tier  3  SES/DISES  (or  civilian equivalent) member and will not be the immediate supervisor of the position. 3.2.2.1.2.  An individual from the selecting organization.  It is recommended that the supervisor of the position fill this position, unless the supervisor is also the selecting official. 3.2.2.1.3.  A Secretary of the Air Force (SAF) or Air Staff functional. 3.2.2.1.4.  An individual from outside the organization or functional community. 3.2.3.  All  eligible candidates are rated and ranked by the Rating and Ranking Panel  on the basis  of  their  knowledge,  skills,  abilities  and  other  job-related  factors,  as  reflected  in  the position’s qualifications standard.  If the position is an SES/DISES the panel members must adequately  document  the  basis  for  qualifications,  rating  and  ranking  determinations.    The panel  chair  will  certify  that  the  ECQs  of  those  selected  for  an  interview  would  pass  ERB scrutiny and believe the ECQs will meet the criteria of a QRB review. the  candidate(s)  determined 3.2.4.  Interview  Panel.  The Rating and Ranking Panel that reviewed the applications also interviews forwards recommendations in rank order to the selecting official.  Interviews should be held in person.  The  hiring  organization  is  responsible  for  all  costs  associated  with  travel  for  candidates selected for an interview and any subsequent interviews. to  be  “Best  Qualified"  and 3.2.5.  The Selecting Official.  The selecting official for all CSE positions will be one of the following:  four-star GO, HAF 2-ltr official/MAJCOM/Combatant Commanders.  If the HAF 2-ltr  official/MAJCOM/Combatant  Commander  is  only  a  two-star  GO  (or  equivalent),  the referral  certificate  must  be  routed  to  his/her  supervisor  to  at  least  a  three-star  GO  (or equivalent)  at  the  HAF  level.    The  selecting  official  may  chose  any  one  of  the  candidates referred and may interview any of the candidates forwarded for selection recommendation. 3.2.6.  The  tentative  selection  of  an  SES/DISES/SL  is  forwarded  by  AFSEMO  to  the  ERB, for consideration.  The ERB recommends final approval to the SECAF for appointment.  For a  new  appointment  to  the  SES,  the  appointment  is  not  effective  until  final  approval  is received from the QRB at OPM. 3.2.7.  The  Executive  Resources  Board  (ERB)–Case  Processing.  AFSEMO  facilitates ERB  case  processing.    The  ERB  is  held  regularly  to  review  all  pending  recruitment  cases.  Before initial appointment to SES/DISES or SL positions, the ERB screens the technical and executive  qualifications  of  each  eligible  candidate  to  make  recommendations  for  candidate selection to the SECAF for final approval. 3.2.8.  Upon SECAF approval, for SES appointments, the candidate’s ECQs (if they have not been previously certified) are forwarded to OPM QRB to complete the certification process.  All candidates must meet the qualification requirements for the position for which selected. 3.2.9.  Qualifications  Review Board (QRB).  OPM administers regularly scheduled QRBs.  The  QRB  convenes  to  provide  a  critical,  independent  peer  review  of  a  candidate’s  ECQs.  The  board  membership  is  composed  of  SES  members  from  three  different  agencies.    A majority  of  the  board  members  must  be  SES  Career  appointees.    Board  members  are  not permitted  to  review  their  own  agency’s  candidates,  and  if  a  member  otherwise  believes he/she cannot provide an impartial review, the member will be excused from the case review. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   13  3.2.9.1.  The  QRB  review  helps  to  ensure  technical  expertise  does  not  outweigh  the candidate’s leadership skills.  The ECQ criteria encompass demonstrated executive level experience  or  successful  participation  in  an  OPM-approved  candidate  development program.    The  criterion  also  provides  for  flexibility  to  allow  appointment  of  those  with unique  qualities  that  signify  an  appointee’s  likelihood  to  succeed.    The  QRB  either approves or disapproves the candidate’s ECQs. 3.2.9.2.  Upon  ECQs  approval,  OPM  notifies  the  Air  Force  to  proceed  with  the appointment.  Career appointments may be made to any SES position. 3.2.9.3.  Disapproved  actions  are  usually  due  to  the  candidate  not  meeting  the  ECQ requirements  or  not  adequately  addressing  his/her  qualifications  in  relation  to  the  five ECQs.  A disapproved case may be resubmitted for a second review within 60 working days.   If  a case is  disapproved a second time, the candidate may not  be resubmitted for any  SES  positions  for  12  months  from  the  closing  date  of  the  original  announcement.  This  allows  time  for  the  candidate  to  acquire  additional  qualifying  experience  in  the deficient areas as noted by the QRB. 3.3.  Suspension  of  Qualifications  Review  Board  (QRB)  Certification  for  Specific Agencies.  The  Office  of  Personnel  Management  initiates  a  QRB  moratorium  for  all  SES appointments in the event the SECAF resigns, or announces an intention to resign. 3.3.1.  The  moratorium  is  lifted  when  the  President  nominates  a  new  SECAF.    To  fill  a mission  critical  position  during  this  time,  the  case  may  be  submitted  to  AFSEMO  with  a request for an exception to the QRB moratorium. 3.3.2.  The case will go to the ERB for recommendation and to the Acting SECAF requesting approval.  Factors considered include whether the new SECAF would have personal interest in  the  selection,  the  organizational  level  of  the  position,  the  degree  to  which  the  candidate would  be  involved  in  policy  matters  and  how  long  it  may  be  before  the  new  SECAF  is appointed. 3.4.  Appeals.  There is no right of appeal for a non-selected individual on actions taken by the ERB,  QRB  or  the  SECAF.    Other  avenues  afforded  by  law  or  regulation  (e.g.,  prohibited personnel  practice  allegations  or  discrimination  complaints)  may  be  pursued  if  appropriate. Applicants  may  contact  the  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board  (MSPB)  or  the  appropriate  Air Force Equal Opportunity Office, if they have complaints falling under their purview. 3.4.1.  Air  Force  employees  are  expected  to  use  the  Air  Force  grievance  procedures  to resolve allegations of irregularities in recruitment and selection for CSE positions, other than those related to prohibited personnel practices or violations of equal opportunity law. 3.4.2.  CSE  recruitment  and  selection  procedures  are  made  available  for  review  by AFSEMO. 3.4.3.  At the conclusion of the Rating and Ranking Panel, AFSEMO provides each applicant with a written notification on the status of his/her application and if the applicant is selected for an interview. 3.4.4.  By  request,  AFSEMO  will  provide  feedback  to  applicants  concerning  the  rating  and ranking  of  his/her  application.    If  candidates  request  specific  feedback  from  a  Rating  and Ranking Panel member, AFSEMO will coordinate this process.   14  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 3.5.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  and  Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive  Service (DISES) Appointments. 3.5.1.  Career  Appointment.  SES/DISES  applicants  are  selected  for  Career  appointment through the Air Force senior executive merit staffing process.  Career appointees are afforded specific due process protections. 3.5.2.

To be eligible for a limited appointment the individual  must  hold  a  career  or  career  conditional  appointment  (or  equivalent  tenure)  in  a permanent Civil Service position outside the SES and meet the qualifications for the position.   The use of the limited appointment must be approved by the SECAF.  Appointments may be terminated at the discretion of the SECAF.  When the limited appointment is terminated for reasons other than misconduct, neglect of duty or malfeasance, the individual is entitled to be placed in his/her former position or a position of like status, tenure and grade.  There are two types of limited appointments:  Limited Term and Limited Emergency. 3.5.2.1.  Limited  Term  Appointment  (LTA).  An LTA is a nonrenewable appointment for up to 36 months to a position that must be abolished when the appointment expires. 3.5.2.2.  Limited  Emergency  Appointment.  A  Limited  Emergency  appointment  is  a nonrenewable  appointment  for  up  to18  months  to  a  position  established  to  meet  a  bona fide, unanticipated, urgent need. 3.5.2.3.  Extensions.  Limited  appointments  may  be  extended  without  prior  OPM approval,  if  the  initial  appointment  was  for  less  than  the  maximum  allowed  period  of time.  An individual who held one or more limited appointments, for a total of 36 months in a 48 month period, will not continue to serve in a limited appointment.  Requests for extensions require ERB approval. 3.6.  Other Appointment Types. 3.6.1.  SL/ST/DISL are Career appointments. 3.6.2.  HQE appointments are in the Excepted Service. 3.6.3.  Presidential  Appointees.  These  appointees  include  personnel  appointed  by  the President  with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate,  NC  SES  members  and  Schedule  C personnel approved by OPM. 3.7.  Recognition  on  Appointment  or  Transfer  from  another  Component/Agency.  When appointed or reassigned to an Air Force CSE position from another component/agency, the CSE receives a welcome package from AFSEMO.  Welcome packages will include: CSE appointment certificate  signed  by  the  SECAF,  appropriate  lapel  pin,  welcome  letter,  vehicle  decal  and handbook.    In  addition,  newly  appointed  SES/DISES  members  will  receive  the  Air  Force  SES Flag. 3.8.  Conditions of Employment. 3.8.1.  Financial  Disclosure.  As a condition of employment, all CSEs shall file a Standard Form  278 (SF 278),  Public Financial Disclosure Report.  This  form  must  be filed with  the Deputy General Counsel for Fiscal, Ethics and Administrative Law, Office of the Air Force General Counsel (SAF/GCA). AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   15  3.8.2.  Mobility Agreements.  All members appointed to the SES/DISES are required to sign a  Reassignment  Rights  and  Obligations  Agreement.    This  agreement  is  maintained  by AFSEMO. 3.8.3.  Drug  Testing.  Prior  to  appointment,  or  reassignment  to  another  CSE  position,  all CSEs are required to  complete and pass  drug urinalysis testing.  Once appointed, CSEs are required to undergo periodic random drug testing in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 12564, Drug Free Federal Workplace, dated 15 September 1986. 3.8.4.  Conflict  of  Interest  Prohibition.  All  CSEs  are  subject  to  the  rules  prohibiting participating “personally and substantially” in  any  agency matter that  affects  their financial interests (or that of a spouse, children, or organization whose interests are imputed to them). 3.8.5.  One Year Cooling Off Period.  All CSEs who serve more than 60 days in a calendar year and whose basic rate of pay is over that amount designated for the appropriate year, are subject to a one year cooling off period after they leave the agency (Air Force) and may not represent back to the agency during that year. 3.8.6.  Lifetime  and  Two  Year  Ban.  All  CSEs  involved  personally  and  substantially  in agency  matters  are  permanently  barred  from  representing  anyone  back  to  any  Federal Department,  agency,  or  court  on  that  same  matter.    If  a  matter  was  under  a  CSE’s  official responsibility during the last year of Government service, then he/she is barred for two years after leaving Government service from representing anyone back to the Government on that same matter. 3.9.  Probationary Period for New Appointments.  All new Career CSEs are required to serve a 12 month probationary period. 3.9.1.  At  the  time  of  appointment,  AFSEMO  will  provide  the  probationer,  and  his/her supervisor, the  supervisor  and  CSE responsibilities. initial  probation  notification  addressing   an 3.9.2.  At the six month period, a notification, from AFSEMO, is provided for the supervisor to review and document the performance. 3.9.3.  At the ten month period, a request is made, from AFSEMO, for the supervisor to sign and return the Probationary Period Certification. 3.9.4.  At  the  11-month  period,  AFSEMO  will  forward  the  signed  Probationary  Period Certification to the appointing authority, or designee, for review and final approval. 3.9.5.  The  Career  appointment  becomes  final  after  the  successful  completion  of  the probationary period. 3.9.6.  Unsuccessful performance will be referred to SAF/GCA for appropriate action. 3.9.7.  A Career CSE who does not successfully complete the probationary period is entitled to be placed in a vacant Civil Service position (other than an SES position) for which he or she is qualified, in any agency, that is a continuing position at GS-15 or above, or equivalent, that will last at least three months.  The Air Force is responsible for placing the appointee in an  appropriate  position  within  the  agency,  or  for  arranging  a  transfer  to  an  appropriate position in another agency.   16  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 Chapter 4 OTHER STAFFING ACTIONS 4.1.  Reassignments.  In  creating  the  SES,  DoD  envisioned  a  mobile  corps  of  SES/DISES members who may be reassigned to meet shifting agency priorities.  DoD embraces this vision thereby  encouraging  functional  and  geographical  mobility  as  a  condition  of  employment  for SES/DISES appointments.  Through succession planning and career development, the Air Force ensures  all  SES/DISES  incumbents  are  provided  assignments  to  advance  their  career  and  meet the  Air  Force  quality  and  operational  performance  objectives.    Note:    This  chapter  does  not apply to PAS, NC SES members and HQEs. 4.1.1.  The Air Force may reassign a Career SES/DISES member to any SES/DISES position in the agency for which they are qualified.  Failure to accept a directed reassignment subjects the individual to removal under adverse action procedures. 4.1.2.  Career  SES/DISES  members  cannot  be  reassigned  within  120  days  after  the appointment of the SECAF. 4.1.3.  Career  SES/DISES  members  cannot  be  reassigned  within  120  days  after  the appointment of the Career appointee’s most immediate supervisor, if the supervisor is a NC appointee (PAS or NC SES) and has the authority to make an initial appraisal of the Career appointee’s performance. 4.2.  Reassignment  Action.  AFSEMO  is  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  to  fill SES/DISES vacancies.  The process is outlined below and in Attachment 6: 4.2.1.  Selecting official (four-star GO, HAF 2-ltr official/MAJCOM/Combatant Commander requests a position slate from AFSEMO. 4.2.2.  AFSEMO  provides  referral  notification  to  HAF  2-ltr  officials/MAJCOM/Combatant Commanders  for their  organization,  while simultaneously notifying the SES/DISES members of the referral. identified  SES/DISES  members the in 4.2.3.  AFSEMO provides a position slate with contact information, biography and a civilian personnel brief to the selecting official.   Selecting official can select by interview or records review. 4.2.3.1.  Tier  1.    Selecting  officials  consider  slated  candidates.    If  the  candidates  do  not meet  requirements,  selecting  officials  may  request  external  recruitment,  or  additional candidates from AFSEMO.  Candidates will be forwarded based on the TMB results (i.e., readiness ratings, etc). 4.2.3.2.  Tier 2/3.  Selecting officials first consider the slated candidates.  If TMB results are  not  used,  the  selecting  official  must  provide  a  justification  to  the  ERB  and  may request  additional candidates or provide a justification for a proposed SES member that has  been  identified  as  suitable  for  the  position.    Alternatively,  the  selecting  official  can request  to  recruit  for  external  candidates.      For  all  Tier  2/3  and  Combatant  Command positions,  regardless  of  tier,  AFSEMO  will  concurrently  request  candidate  slates  from across  DoD  for  the  selecting  official  to  consider.    Upon  selection  of  a  candidate, AFSEMO will forward the selection documentation to the SECAF for final approval. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   17  4.2.4.  Notice  to  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)/Defense  Intelligence  Senior  Executive Service (DISES) Member.  After SECAF approval, the SES/DISES member must be given 15 days advance written notice for a reassignment in the same commuting area, and 60 days advance written notice for reassignments to a new geographic area. 4.2.4.1.  Reconsideration.  SES/DISES members unwilling to accept a reassignment may request reconsideration.  The written request must state the reason the reassignment is not in  the  best  interest  of  the  member  and/or  the  Air  Force.    Hardship  to  the  SES/DISES member  should  be  documented  by  the  SES/DISES  member  for  consideration  by  the ERB.  If an SES/DISES member disagrees with the ERB decision he/she may appeal the final decision to the SECAF.  The appeal must be submitted to AFSEMO. 4.2.4.2.  Failure  to  Accept  a  Directed  Reassignment.  SES/DISES  members unwilling to accept reassignment are subject to removal.  If removal is for failure to accept directed reassignment  to  a  different  commuting  area,  the  individual  may  be  entitled  to discontinued  service  retirement  (if  eligible)  or  severance  pay,  unless  a  memorandum  of understanding  or  other  written  agreement  provides  for  such  geographic  reassignments.  Removal under these circumstances can be appealed to the MSPB. 4.2.4.3.  Reassignment  to  a  Lower  Tier.  SES/DISES members may be reassigned to a lower tier for the following specific reasons: 4.2.4.3.1.  Discretion of the Authorizing Official.  When a reassignment action to a lower tier is initiated to meet organizational needs such as executive development, the SES/DISES member will retain his/her salary/DV code and future pay increases will be grandfathered. 4.2.4.3.2.  Reassignment  to  a  Lower  Tier  at  the  Request  of  the  Member.  The SES/DISES  member  will  retain  his/her  salary,  assume  the  DV  code  of  the  new position, and may receive only 50 percent of future pay increases (exceptions may be applied). 4.3.  Details.  A  detail  is  the  temporary  movement  of  an  employee  within,  into,  or  out  of  the SES/DISES for a specified period, usually with the expectation that the employee will return to his/her  regular  position  at  the  end  of  the  period.    Administratively,  for  purposes  of  pay  and benefits,  the  employee  continues  to  be  the  incumbent  of  the  position  from  which  he/she  is detailed. 4.3.1.  Details  of  Non-Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)/Defense  Intelligence  Senior Executive Service (DISES) Employees to Senior Executive Service/Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive  Service  Positions.  Details of non-SES/DISES employees to SES/DISES positions  should  be  kept  to  an  absolute  minimum  and  strictly  controlled.    The  employee continues to encumber the position from which detailed, for purposes of pay and benefits. 4.3.1.1.  The duties of a  vacant  SES/DISES  position may  be restructured  temporarily to an appropriate level outside the SES when a non-SES/DISES employee is to be detailed to  an  SES/DISES  position.    If  that  is  not  possible,  the  organization  should  ensure  the detail authority is used judiciously.  If a position has to be filled on detail for an extended period, an organization should consider rotating more than one qualified employee on the detail.   18  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 4.3.1.2.  Details  of  non-SES/DISES  employees  should  not  be  used  as  a  means  of providing  a  specific  employee  the  opportunity  to  acquire  the  qualifications  required  for entry into the SES. 4.3.2.  Details of SES/DISES members to non-SES/DISES positions below the SES level are generally considered to be an inappropriate use of executive talent. 4.3.3.  Conditions.  Initial details and extensions are to be made in accordance with  5  USC 3341, Details; within Executive or military departments and 5  CFR 317.903(b)(1), Details, which authorizes details in increments of no more than 120 days.  Competitive Service merit promotion  procedures  must  be  observed  when  detailing  non-SES/DISES  employees  to  an SES/DISES position for more than 240 days. 4.3.4.  Requests  to  detail  a  non-SES/DISES  member  to  an  SES/DISES  position  must  be submitted to AFSEMO. 4.4.  Reduction-in-Force  (RIF).  This  applies  to  Career  SES  members  only.    For  SL/ST members,  follow  the  regulatory  provisions  applicable  to  Air  Force  employees  at  grades  GS-15 (or  equivalent)  and  below.    For  DISES/DISL  members  contact  AFSEMO  for  RIF  procedure guidance. 4.4.1.  The  RIF  procedures  are  only  used  when  the  elimination  or  modification  of  an  SES position is due to reorganization, a lack of funds or a curtailment of work that results in the need to separate an SES member. 4.4.2.  The  RIF  option  is  only  used  after  all  other  options  for  placement  of  SES  members have been exhausted.  The RIF procedures are conducted with prior ERB approval. 4.4.3.  Career  SES  members  who  have  completed  probation  can  be  assigned  to  any  vacant Air Force SES position for which he/she qualifies.  Vacant positions within their employing Component are first considered, the Air Force, elsewhere in DoD, and other agencies, in that order.  If no vacancy exists, OPM has 45 days to try to place the SES member elsewhere in the  Government.    If  the  SES  member  cannot  be  placed  in  the  SES,  the  SES  member  is entitled to placement in the agency at a grade GS-15 (or equivalent) position with saved pay. 4.4.4.  If an SES member declines a reasonable offer of placement to another SES position, or if no placement offer can be made, the member will be separated from the SES following a 45-day written notice.  A second notice, one day in advance of the termination date, is also required.  If RIF procedures are invoked, contact AFSEMO for further guidance. 4.4.5.  A  Career  SES  employee  separated  by  RIF  may  appeal  to  the  MSPB  on  the competitive procedures taken under a RIF. 4.5.  Resignations.  The  CSE,  or the  CSE’s  supervisor  (or  designated  representative), coordinates the resignation with AFSEMO.  After coordination, the CSE or CSE’s supervisor (or designated  representative),  must  contact  the  servicing  CPF  and  request  a  resignation  action  be processed. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   19  Chapter 5 SUSPENSION AND REMOVALS 5.1.  Suspensions.  A suspension is considered an adverse action (if over 14 days).  It serves as a warning that further violation of rules could result in removal and is an attempt at rehabilitation of  the  employee.    A  suspension  is  a  disciplinary  action  which  prevents  an  SES  member  from performing  work  and  withholds  salary  for  the  suspension  period.    Procedural  requirements  are covered  in  5  CFR,  Part  752,  Adverse  Actions.    The  DISES/DISL/SL/ST  member  suspensions follow the regulatory and AFI provisions applicable to Air Force employees at grades GS-15 (or equivalent)  and  below.    Note:    This  chapter  does  not  apply  to  PAS,  NC  SES  members  and HQEs. 5.1.1.  Commanders  or  supervisors  may  not  take  unilateral  action  against  CSE  members.  Contact  AFSEMO  for  interpretation  of  the  requirements  and  guidance  on  the  suspension process.   Proposed suspension actions are submitted to  AFSEMO for approval  by the ERB before formal employee notification. 5.1.2.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  Suspensions.  SES  members  and  LTA  or  Limited Emergency members, without a break in service from a Career appointment in the Air Force, may  be  suspended  for  disciplinary  reasons,  as  defined  as  misconduct,  neglect  of  duty, malfeasance or failure to accept a directed reassignment or accompany a position in a transfer of function.  Guiding SES statutory and regulatory requirements only allow for a suspension period of 14 days or more for SES members. 5.1.3.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  Suspension  Process.  An  SES  member  against whom  an  action  is  proposed  is  entitled  to  at  least  30  days  advance  written  notice  of  the suspension  unless  the  SES  member  has  committed  a  crime  for  which  a  sentence  of imprisonment may be imposed.  In that case, a shortened notice period may be invoked.  The SES  member  will  remain  in  a  duty  status  during  the  advance  notice  period  unless  the  SES member’s presence poses a threat to the member or others, results in loss of, or damage to, Government property or otherwise jeopardizes legitimate Government interests.  In that case, administrative leave may be appropriate.  The notice letter must state the specific reasons for the  proposed  action  and  inform  the  SES  member  of  his/her  right  to  review  the  material supporting the suspension. 5.1.3.1.  The  SES  member  may  answer  orally,  in  writing,  or  both  and  is  entitled  to  be represented  by  an  attorney  or  other  representative.    The  Air  Force  must  give  the  SES member  a  reasonable  amount  of  official  time  to  review  the  supporting  material  and prepare his/her response, but not less than seven days.  If a medical condition affected the basis  of  the  suspension,  the  SES  member  must  be  given  reasonable  time  to  furnish medical documentation. 5.1.3.2.  The Air Force will consider only the reasons specified in the notice of proposed action,  the  oral  and/or  written  response  of  the  SES  member,  the  SES  member’s representative,  or  both  and  any  medical  documentation  provided  in  making  a determination.   20  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 5.1.3.3.  The  decision  letter  must  specify  in  writing  the  reasons  for  the  decision  and advise  the  SES  member  of  any  appeal  rights.    The  notice  must  be  delivered  before  the effective date of the action. 5.1.3.4.  SES and LTA or Limited Emergency SES members, without a break in service from a Career appointment in the Air Force, have the right to appeal a suspension to the MSPB. 5.1.4.  Limited Term Appointment (LTA)/Limited Emergency Senior Executive Service (SES)  Suspensions.  Neither  the  laws,  nor  regulations,  cover  procedural  requirements  for suspending LTA SES members, Limited Emergency SES members or reemployed annuitants for disciplinary reasons.  If an employee is a LTA or Limited Emergency SES employee they may fall under the rules depending on their prior appointment. 5.2.  Removals.  A removal is the most severe adverse action.  Before initiating a removal of an SES  member,  ensure  the  individual  has  demonstrated  unwillingness  to  conform  to  the  rules  of conduct,  performance  standards  or  has  so  breached  the  employee-employer  relationship  that rehabilitation  is  not  appropriate  and  removal  is  warranted  for  the  offense.    Procedural requirements  are  5  CFR,  Part  752,  Adverse  Actions.    Note:    for  DISES/DISL/SL/ST  member suspensions,  follow  the  regulatory  and  AFI  provisions  applicable  to  Air  Force  employees  at grades GS-15  (or equivalent) and below.  The procedural  requirements  for removal due to  less than  successful  performance  are  found  in  5  CFR,  Part  359,  Subpart  E,  Removal  of  Career Appointees for Less Than Fully Successful Executive Performance. 5.2.1.  Commanders  or  supervisors  may  not  take  unilateral  action  against  CSEs.    Proposed removal actions for  any  reason  are submitted to  AFSEMO for approval  by the ERB before formal employee notification.  Contact AFSEMO for interpretation of the requirements and guidance on the removal process. 5.2.2.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  Disciplinary  Removal.  Disciplinary  removal procedures  and  rights  for  post-probation  Career  SES  and  LTA  or  Limited  Emergency  SES members, without a break in service from a Career appointment in the Air Force, are similar to  those  for  Competitive  Service  employees,  except  the  standard  for  action  is  misconduct, neglect  of  duty,  malfeasance  or  failure  to  accept  a  directed  reassignment  or  accompany  a position  in  a  transfer  of  function.    The  Air  Force  does  not  have  to  show  a  nexus  to  the “efficiency of the service.” 5.2.2.1.  Disciplinary  Removal  Process.  The  post-probation  disciplinary  removal process  is  the  same  as  the  suspension  process  described  in  item  5.1.3    Probationary employees  are  covered  by  different  rules,  as  set  forth  below  and  in  5  CFR,  Part  359, Removal  from  the  Senior  Executive  Service;  Guaranteed  Placement  in  Other  Personnel Systems. 5.2.2.2.  SES, LTA or Limited Emergency SES members, without a break in service from a Career appointment in the Air Force, have the right to appeal a disciplinary removal to the MSPB. 5.2.2.3.  SES  members  removed  for  disciplinary  reasons  have  no  placement  rights  to  a grade GS-15 (or equivalent) position. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   21  5.2.3.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  Member  Removal  for  Performance.  Post-probation  SES  members  (this  does  not  include  Limited  Term  or  Limited  Emergency  SES members,  without  a  break  in  service  from  a  Career  appointment  in  the  Air  Force)  may  be optionally or mandatorily removed based on their record of performance.  See  5  CFR,  Part 359.  Note:  For removal of DISL/SL/ST members,  follow the provisions applicable to Air Force employees at grade GS-15 (or equivalent) and below. 5.2.3.1.  Optional  Removal.  If  an  SES  member  receives  one  unsatisfactory  rating, he/she may be removed or reassigned to another SES position in which he/she qualifies. 5.2.3.2.  Mandatory Removal.  An SES member must be removed from the SES for two unsatisfactory  ratings  in  five  consecutive  years,  or  for  two  less  than  fully  successful ratings in three consecutive years. 5.2.3.3.  Performance  Removal  Process.  The  Air  Force  notifies  the  SES  member  in writing  at  least  30  calendar  days  before  the  effective  date  of  the  action.    The  notice advises the SES member of the basis of the action, the SES member’s placement rights if any, the SES member’s right to request an informal hearing from the MSPB, the effective date  of  the  action,  and  the  SES  member’s  eligibility  for  immediate  retirement,  if applicable. 5.2.3.3.1.  An  SES  member  cannot  formally  appeal  removal  for  performance  to  the MSPB, but is entitled to request an MSPB informal hearing at least 15 days before the effective  date  of  the  removal.    The  informal  hearing  should  not  delay  the  removal action. 5.2.3.3.2.  An SES member removed from the SES for performance reasons is placed into a continuing position at grade GS-15 (or equivalent), with saved pay.  In lieu of placement in a grade GS-15 (or equivalent) position, the SES may elect discontinued service retirement with 25 years of service or 20 years of service at age 50. 5.2.3.3.3.  An  SES  member  cannot  be  removed  for  performance  reasons  until  120 days  after  appointment  of  a  new  SECAF  or  new  NC  supervisor  with  removal authority, except removals based on a rating(s) issued prior to appointment of the new SECAF or NC supervisor.  Contact AFSEMO if this issue arises. 5.2.4.  Senior  Executive  Service  (SES)  Member  Removal  During  Probationary Period.  An  SES  member  may  be  removed  during  the  one  year  probationary  period  for unacceptable performance, misconduct,  conditions arising before appointment or Reduction In Force (RIF).  See  5  CFR, Part  359.  The RIF procedures are described in Chapter  4 of this AFI. 5.2.4.1.  For  unacceptable  performance  during  the  probationary  period,  the  Air  Force notifies the  SES member in writing before the effective date of the removal action. 5.2.4.1.1.  The notice, as a minimum, states the conclusions as to the inadequacies of the SES member’s performance, whether the SES member has placement rights and if so,  identifies  the  position,  and  the  effective  date  of  the  action.    If  the  SES  member was not in the Federal Service at the time of the initial appointment to the SES from which  the  SES  member  is  being  removed  or  if  the  SES  member  was  in  an  NC position previously, the individual has no placement rights.   22  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 5.2.4.1.2.  An  SES  member  removed  for  unacceptable  performance  cannot  appeal  a removal during the probationary period to the MSPB. 5.2.4.2.  For  misconduct  during  the  probationary  period,  the  Air  Force  notifies  the  SES member in writing before the effective date of the removal action. 5.2.4.2.1.  The notice, as a minimum states the basis for the removal action (including the acts of misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance) and the effective date of the action. 5.2.4.2.2.  An SES member removed for misconduct cannot appeal a removal during the probationary period to the MSPB. the 5.2.4.3.  For  conditions  arising  before  appointment,  but  discovered  during probationary period, the  Air Force provides the SES  member an  advance  written notice stating  the  specific  reasons  for  the  proposed  removal.    The  SES  member  is  given  a reasonable  time  to  reply.    The  Air  Force  provides  the  SES  member  a  written  decision indicating the reasons for the action and the effective date.  The decision is provided to the SES member before the action is effective. 5.2.4.3.1.  The SES member cannot appeal a removal during the probationary period for conditions arising before appointment. 5.2.4.3.2.  The SES member is entitled to placement in a grade GS-15 (or equivalent) position,  with  saved  pay,  unless  the  SES  member  was  appointed  to  the  SES  from outside the Government or from a NC-type appointment. 5.2.4.4.  An SES member in a probationary period cannot be removed until 120 days after appointment  of  a  new  SECAF  or  new  NC  supervisor  with  removal  authority,  except removals  based  on  a  performance  rating(s)  received  prior  to  appointment  of  the  new SECAF  or  NC  supervisor;  a  disciplinary  action  initiated  before  appointment  of  a  new SECAF or NC supervisor; a disciplinary action when there is reasonable cause to believe the  SES  member  has  committed  a  crime  for  which  a  sentence  of  imprisonment  may  be imposed; or when the circumstances are such that retention of the SES member poses a threat to the SES member or others, results in loss of or damage to Government property, or  otherwise  jeopardize  legitimate  Government  interests.    If  this  issue  arises,  contact AFSEMO for additional guidance. 5.2.5.  Removal of Limited Term Senior Executive Service (SES) Members.  These SES members serve at the discretion of the SECAF and can be removed at any time.   AFSEMO provides  written  notice  at  least  seven  calendar  days  before  the  effective  date  of  a  removal action.    Limited  Term  SES  members  are  not  entitled  to  appeal  rights  to  the  MSPB  nor  to placement rights. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   23  Chapter 6 PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT 6.1.  Performance  Management.  AFSEMO  manages  the  performance-based  pay  system  for CSEs.     The  intent  of  the  performance-based  pay  system  is  to  make  meaningful  distinctions  in performance and hold CSEs accountable for their individual and organizational performance by linking  results  to  an  agency’s  strategic  planning  initiatives  as  an  effective  means  of  achieving this goal.   Note:  This chapter does not  apply to PAS members and HQEs.  HQE performance management guidance is addressed separately in chapter 10 of this AFI. 6.1.1.  AFSEMO ensures policies and procedures are in place so the appraisal system allows meaningful distinctions to be made based on relative performance and the Annual Summary Ratings  (ASRs),  pay  adjustments  and  bonuses  to  accurately  reflect  the  employee’s performance and their contribution to the Air Force mission. 6.1.2.  Executive  Performance  Appraisal  Tool  (EPAT).  EPAT  is  a  mandated  web-based DoD  enterprise  tool  to  aid  CSEs,  rating  and  reviewing  officials  with  their  individual  and organizational  performance  management  responsibilities.    Air  Force  CSEs  will  have  an account  established  in  EPAT.    The  CSEs  rating  and  reviewing  official  will  also  have  an account  established in the system, even if that rating and reviewing official is from another Federal agency or a different DoD component, a NC CSE, a PAS or an active duty GO.  It is the responsibility of the CSE to ensure their information is accurate. 6.2.  Performance  Plan.  The  performance  plan  sets  forth  the  performance  requirements  that must  be  accomplished  during  the  performance  appraisal  period  (1  October  to  30  September).  Each performance plan must include the mandatory Performance Elements (PEs) with associated results-driven performance requirements that are aligned with Air Force organizational goals. 6.2.1.  The performance plan and performance requirements must be developed jointly by the rating  official  and  the  CSE.    The  rating  official  must  clearly  set  the  performance expectations. 6.2.2.  The development of the performance plan does not involve the reviewing official.  All plans  are  to  be  completed  in  EPAT  by  selecting  an  Air  Force  performance  plan  template (categorized  by  pay  plan  and  tier  level,  if  appropriate).    Each  CSE  will  develop  a performance plan using the guidelines established below: 6.2.3.  The performance plan must be completed within 30 days after a CSE is appointed to the  Air Force or within the start of a new performance cycle. 6.2.3.1.  A  change  in  position  or  rating  official  during  the  performance  appraisal  period may  necessitate  a  modification  or  a  complete  revision  of  the  performance  plan.    If  a change occurs, the new performance plan must be completed within 30 days. 6.2.3.2.  A CSE must have at least 90 days under the new performance plan, as of the end of the performance appraisal period, to be eligible to receive an ISR.  The ISR provides the preliminary performance assessment of the CSE.   24  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 6.2.4.  Performance  Elements  (PEs).  Each  performance  plan  must  include  the  mandatory PEs,  with  associated  results-driven  performance  requirements  that  are  aligned  to  Air  Force organizational goals.  The following PEs may be selected to appraise a CSE’s performance; the  first  three  are  mandatory.    For  current  information  on  mandatory  and  optional  PEs, contact AFSEMO for the latest guidance. 6.2.4.1.  Contribution to Mission Accomplishment (mandatory) 6.2.4.2.  Leadership/Supervision (mandatory) 6.2.4.3.  Customer Care (mandatory) 6.2.4.4.  Technical Competence/Problem Solving 6.2.4.5.  Resource Management 6.2.4.6.  Communication 6.2.4.7.  Cooperation/Teamwork 6.2.5.  Performance  Element  (PE)  Weight  Distribution.  The  Air  Force  has  assigned weights to the mandatory and optional PEs contained in the performance plan.  “Contribution to  Mission  Accomplishment”  must  be  weighted  at  least  60  percent  among  all  PEs  selected.   The  sum  of  the  weights  for  all  PEs  used  is  100  percent.    The  current  Air  Force  weight distributions  are  specified  by  the  CSEs  pay  plan  and  tier,  if  applicable.    The  weight distribution is also pre-set in EPAT in the performance plan template.  For specific PE weight distribution requirements contact AFSEMO for the latest guidance. 6.3.  Performance  Requirements.  Performance  requirements  are  the  duties  upon  which  the CSE will be evaluated during the mid-term feedback and the annual performance appraisal.  The requirements  should  represent  the  most  important  and/or  time  consuming  portion  of  the  CSE’s duties.  The performance requirements will not represent all duties. 6.3.1.  Performance requirements must show alignment to specific goals and objectives in an appropriate  strategic  planning  document  (e.g.,  the  Air  Force  Strategic  Plan).    Performance requirements  may  link  to  non-Air  Force  strategic  guidance  documents  (e.g.,  President’s Management Agenda, National Intelligence Strategy, DoD Organizational Assessment, etc.).   However, the first linkage for Air Force CSEs should be the Air Force Strategic Plan. 6.3.2.  The  rating  official  determines  the  expected  results  and  level  of  accomplishment  for each performance requirement.  All performance requirements must be written at the “Fully Successful” level. 6.3.3.  Performance requirements must be results-oriented and have an outcome stated, with an  appropriate  type(s)  of  measurements  identified  to  determine  success.    They  must  be written in the SMART-Q format: 6.3.3.1.  S - Specific (define results to be accomplished within the scope of the job) 6.3.3.2.  M - Measurable (define quality, quantity, cost and/or effectiveness) 6.3.3.3.  A - Aligned (support specific strategic goals) 6.3.3.4.  R - Realistic/Relevant (requirements are achievable yet challenging) 6.3.3.5.  T - Timely (define a timeframe for achieving the requirements) AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   25  6.3.3.6.  Q - Quality (identify the degree of excellence expected). 6.3.4.  Performance requirements should also include the criteria defined below: 6.3.4.1.  There should be no more than four performance requirements for each PE with the possible exception of the Leadership/Supervision PE for supervisors. 6.3.4.2.  There  are  mandatory  performance  requirements  that  must  be  addressed  for supervisors in the Leadership/Supervision PE.  The mandatory performance requirements include: 6.3.4.2.1.  Employee  Balance.  Proactively  seeks  and  listens  to  employees  and objectively  considers  others'  ideas  and  opinions,  even  when  they  conflict  with  one's own; use of employee feedback to inform decisions. 6.3.4.2.2.  Hiring  Reform.  Effectively  attracts/recruits  a  high  caliber  workforce; ensure successful transition/ retention into Federal Service by providing opportunities for  orientation  and  tools  for  enabling  employees  to  successfully  perform  during  the probationary period; ensure recruiting is appropriately focused and timely to produce high quality candidate pools. 6.3.4.2.3.  Diversity.  Achieves  results  in  promoting  equal  employment  opportunity and  diversity  (as  broadly  defined  by  the  Air  Force)  in  the  performance  of responsibilities in accordance with requirements identified in organizational goals. 6.3.4.2.4.  Accountability.  Ensures that all subordinate employee performance plans are aligned with organizational goals; appraised realistically against clear, measurable standards  of  performance;  and  that  employee  views  are  considered  in  achieving organizational results. 6.3.4.2.5.  Customer  Care.  The  Customer  Care  PE,  for  both  supervisor’s  and  non-supervisor’s, performance requirement must address Customer Balance.  Proactively seeks  and  listens  to  customers  and  objectively  considers  others'  ideas  and  opinions, even  when  they  conflict  with  one's  own;  and  uses  customer  feedback  to  inform decisions. 6.3.5.  Stretch  Goal.  A  requirement can be identified as a “stretch  goal”.   Identification of the “stretch goal” acknowledges the requirement as attainable, but requiring exertion beyond the  normal  course  of  duties.    Reaching  this  goal,  demonstrates  surpassing  the  “Fully Successful” performance level and permits, but does not guarantee a performance rating of 4 or 5.  A stretch goal is not a stand-alone performance requirement.  It must be in addition to a performance requirement written at the fully successful level. 6.4.  Performance  Appraisal  Period.  The  CSE  annual  performance  appraisal  period  is  1 October through 30 September.  CSEs must serve a minimum  of 90 days in  a CSE position in order to be rated and evaluated.  The following exceptions apply 6.4.1.  When  the  member  becomes  a  new  Air  Force  CSE  (i.e.,  transfers  from  an  outside agency other than DoD or receives a promotion from a grade GS-15 (or equivalent) position after the  annual  performance  appraisal  period  (through  appointment, reinstatement, reassignment or transfer). the  start  of   26  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 6.4.2.  When  other  circumstances  occur  to  reduce  the  performance  appraisal  period  to  less than  12  months  (e.g.,  rating  official  departs  before  the  end  of  the  performance  appraisal period).    Exceptions to this rule occur within the last 90 days of the performance period and are as follows: 6.4.2.1.  Movement  within  Department  of  Defense  (DoD).  Air  Force  CSEs  who change jobs to a position in the same or different DoD Component with a different Pay Pool and who served all but the last 90 days of the performance appraisal period, will be provided an ISR (i.e., early annual rating) appraisal by the rating official of record before reassignment,  provided  there  is  an  adequate  basis  on  which  to  appraise  and  rate  the CSE’s performance. 6.4.2.1.1.  The CSE shall be included in the gaining DoD Component Pay Pool at the end of the regular performance cycle. 6.4.2.1.2.  Air Force CSEs who transfer to other agencies within DoD in last 90 days shall receive a rating, performance score and number of Shares from their departing rating official.  The CSE will be included and evaluated in the gaining organization’s Pay Pool and PRB. 6.4.2.2.  Movement outside of Department of Defense (DoD) or New Appointment to a  Civilian  Senior  Executive  (CSE)  Position.  Members  who  are  new  Air  Force  CSEs and  did  not  transfer  from  another  DoD  agency  will  be  eligible  to  receive  their performance  rating  and  evaluation  at  the  end  of  the  next  performance  appraisal  period, after 3 July.  They will be granted an extended performance appraisal period not longer than 15 months. 6.4.2.3.  Air Force CSEs who change jobs within the Air Force in the last 90 days must complete a new performance plan at the start of the next performance cycle.  CSEs will still be evaluated in the Air Force Pay Pool Panel based on their old plan (provided the CSE had 90 days under the old performance plan). 6.4.3.  Movement After the Last Day of the Performance Appraisal Period.  The period from 1 October through to the first pay period in the next calendar year.  CSEs who change jobs to a position in the same or different DoD Component with a different Pay Pool shall be provided  an  ISR  by  the  rating  and  reviewing  officials  of  record  on  the  last  day  of  the appraisal  period.    The  CSE’s  salary  will  be  included  in  the  departing  Pay  Pool.    Their performance  will  be  evaluated  and  the  ASR  assigned  by  the  authorizing  official  in  the departing Pay Pool.  CSE performance payout shall be calculated and paid based on the Pay Pool Funding Factor and Share Value of the gaining Pay Pool. 6.5.  Progress Reviews.  Feedback between the rating official and CSE is a fundamental part of the performance cycle process.    Feedback may serve  as the basis for discussing developmental needs.  The reviewing official is not involved in the progress reviews. 6.5.1.  Mid-Year  Progress  Review.  At  least  one  documented  progress  review  is  required during  the  cycle,  which  is  typically  scheduled  in  the  late  March  or  early  April  timeframe.  The mandatory mid-term progress review will be recorded in EPAT and the date the progress review  was  accomplished  will  be  annotated  on  the  DD  Form  2899,  Executive  Pay  and Performance Appraisal. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   27  6.5.1.1.  Comments  by  the  CSE  are  highly  suggested  during  the  progress  review.  Comments provided may influence the assessment of the CSE’s performance to-date. 6.5.1.2.  Comments during the progress review are highly suggested by the rating official.  The  progress  review  provides  the  CSE  an  understanding  of  current  performance  in relation  to  expected  performance.    This  prepares  the  CSE  for  the  annual  performance appraisal and identifies any needed areas for improvement. 6.5.2.  Frequent  face-to-face  review/feedback  is  encouraged  throughout  the  performance appraisal period to ensure a mutual understanding is developed to better distinguish between less  than  satisfactory,  minimally  satisfactory,  achieving  expectations,  exceeding  expected expectations  and  accomplishing  exceptional  results.    Progress  review  comments  are  not provided to the Pay Pool Panel or PRB. 6.5.3.  After  the  CSE  has  been  under  performance  standards  for  a  minimum  of  90  days  a closeout/interim  feedback  must  be  conducted  when  either  the  CSE  or  rating  official  leaves their  position  before  the  end  of  the  performance  appraisal  period.    Rating  officials  will provide  comments  and  a  score  regarding  the  performance  to  the  individual  who  succeeds them  as  the  rating  official  for  their  consideration  when  completing  the  ISR.    CSEs  do  not provide comments. 6.5.4.  Initial  Summary  Rating  (ISR).  The  ISR  provides  the  preliminary  performance assessment of the CSE.  It provides a recommended performance score (between 0  -100), a recommended performance rating (from level 1 - 5), and a corresponding number of shares.  This  numeric  score  is  derived  from  the  cumulative  assessments  of  the  CSE’s  demonstrated accomplishment in each of the PEs contained within the CSE’s performance plan.  The ISR is  evaluated  by  the  Pay  Pool  and  the  PRB  who  determine  if  any  performance-based  pay increase  and/or  bonus  is  warranted.    A  full  description  is  located  at  the  Air  Force Performance  Rating  Level,  Score  Ranges  and  Shares  for  Payout  Share  Conversion  Chart, Table 7.1  Performance ratings are as follows: 6.5.4.1.  Level  5  –  Exceptional  Results.  Performance  far  exceeds  what  is  expected  in the  attainment  of the  performance  requirement,  as  evidenced  by  exceptional accomplishments of contributions to the mission. 6.5.4.2.  Level 4 – Exceeds Expected Results.  Performance surpasses what is expected in  the  attainment  of  the  performance  requirements  and/or  results  in  the  achievement  of unexpected outcomes that contribute to the mission. 6.5.4.3.  Level  3  –  Achieved  Expectations.  Performance requirements as defined by the performance plan. that  fully  meets the 6.5.4.4.  Level  2  –  Minimally  Satisfactory.  Performance  partially  meets  or demonstrates  some  progress  toward  the  attainment  of  the  performance  requirements described in the performance plan. 6.5.4.5.  Level  1  –  Unsatisfactory.  Performance  fails  to  meet  the  requirements  for  any element in the performance plan.   28  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 6.5.5.  The reviewing official completes a second-level review of the CSE’s ISR assigned by the rating official.  Reviewers may not change the rating official’s ISR.  However, reviewers may non-concur with the rating official’s ISR and provide appropriate rationale within their comment block on the appraisal form prior to the PRB. 6.5.5.1.  Reviewers should meet with rating officials prior to the rating official assigning the CSE an ISR for discussion. 6.5.5.2.  The  CSE  must  acknowledge  receipt  of  the  ISR  within  EPAT.    The  CSE’s acknowledgement  of  receipt  does  not  indicate  concurrence  with  the  ISR  or  comments.  CSEs express non-concurrence through a request for a higher level review (HLR) within seven working days of receipt of the ISR from the rating official. 6.6.  Annual  Performance  Appraisal.  The  annual  performance  appraisal  is  a  mandatory requirement  in  the  performance  management  cycle  and  determines  if  any  performance  pay increase or performance bonus is warranted. 6.6.1.  On  an  annual  basis,  AFSEMO  will  identify  the  time  and  date  that  performance appraisals must be completed to prepare for the Pay Pool Panel and PRB. 6.6.2.  The  CSE  initiates  his/her  own  annual  performance  appraisal  by  providing  specific comments on accomplishments achieved throughout the year. 6.6.3.  Rating  officials  are  required  to  evaluate  a  CSE’s  performance  at  the  end  of  the appraisal period and provide an ISR. 6.6.3.1.  If  the  CSE  received  an  interim/closeout  appraisal  from  a  previous  rating official(s)  any  time  during  the  annual  appraisal  period  (in  cases  where  the  CSE  served under more than one rating official), then the current rating official must also review any previous materials to use in consideration during his/her evaluation of the CSE. 6.6.3.2.  Both individual and organizational performance should be evaluated against the successful  completion  of  the  performance  requirements  in  the  CSE’s  performance  plan (i.e.  results  achieved).    In  cases  where  the  rating  official  is  also  the  reviewer,  no additional reviewer comments are permitted. 6.7.  Performance Rating Process.  For purposes of rating, the following structure is established and applies to all CSEs. 6.7.1.  Rating  Official.  Rating  officials  are  typically  the  immediate  supervisor  and  are responsible for approving and conducting mandatory mid-term feedback and accomplishing annual performance appraisals for assigned CSEs.  Rating officials must discuss their CSE’s individual performance and contribution to the mission, as well as ratings.  The rating official may recommend a Total Performance Payout Adjustment consistent with policy outlined in Subchapter 920, Executive and Senior Professional Pay and Performance System. 6.7.2.  Reviewing  Official.  The  reviewer  is  a  HAF  2-ltr  official/MAJCOM/  Combatant Commander.    The  SECAF  and  CSAF  may  designate  a  single  reviewer  for  Air  Staff  CSEs, respectively,  if  desired.    Reviewers  provide  additional  comments  for  the  CSE  during  the appraisal  stage,  but  do  not  provide  additional  comments  during  the  mid-term  feedback  or performance  plan  creation.    Reviewers  cannot  change  the  rating  official’s  ISR  but  may provide  their  own  comments.    Reviewers  may  also  make  a  recommendation  in  favor  or opposition for a Total Performance Payout Adjustment in the reviewer comments. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   29  6.7.3.  Higher Level Review (HLR).  If the CSE has compelling reason to believe the ISR is not an adequate reflection of his/her performance, the CSE may request an HLR.  CSEs will have seven working days (from receipt of the ISR) to request the HLR.  All requests must be forwarded to AFSEMO. 6.7.3.1.  For  non-concurrence  with  the  ISR  the  CSE  will  provide  justification  and/or documentation to the Higher Level Reviewing Official (HLRO). 6.7.3.2.  The  rating  official  may  also  provide  additional  rationale  and/or  any  supporting comments.  However, the CSE’s comments are not required to be provided to the rating official or reviewer. 6.7.3.3.  The  HLRO  will  review  the  CSE’s  ISR  as  documented,  and  any  justification provided by the CSE, rating official and/or reviewer. 6.7.3.3.1.  The HLRO is typically either another higher-ranking CSE or an active duty GO in the Air Force.  The HLRO is appointed by the SECAF. 6.7.3.3.2.  The  HLRO  may  not  change  the  ISR,  they  may  however,  make recommendations provided along with all supporting documentation to the Pay Pool, PRB and/or SECAF to include comments and/or a score adjustment. 6.7.3.3.3.  Copies  of  the HLRO's  findings  and  recommendations  will  be provided  to the  CSE,  the  rating  official,  the  reviewing  official,  the  Pay  Pool,  the  PRB  and  the authorizing  official.    The  HLR  is  the  final  process  by  which  a  CSE  may  request review  of  the  assigned  ISR.    A  CSE  may  not  grieve  any  performance  plan,  shares allocation,  adjustment  in  basic  pay,  the  non-receipt  of  a  performance  bonus  or  the amount of a performance bonus. 6.7.4.  Pay Pool Panel.  The Pay Pool is a combination of organizational elements and/or tier structure  that  is  defined  for  purposes  of  making  meaningful  distinctions  in  performance  to determine performance payouts. 6.7.4.1.  The Pay Pool Panel is the first step in the review process to ensure performance standards  are  applied  consistently  across  the  organization  and  to  manage,  control  and distribute performance-based pay increases and performance-based bonuses. 6.7.4.2.  Pay Pool Panel Composition.  Pay Pool Panel composition must be established in  a manner that precludes conflicts  of interest.   The membership will include GOs and Career SES members from the Air Force and other Components.  More than one half of the PRB members must be Career SES appointees. 6.7.4.2.1.  Members of the Pay Pool Panel cannot participate in the PRB. 6.7.4.2.2.  Members  of  the  Pay  Pool  Panel  must  possess  a  thorough  knowledge  and understanding  of  the  Air  Force  appraisal  system  gained  through  experience  and  or training. 6.7.4.2.3.  Members of the Pay Pool Panel cannot participate in the rating or scoring of  their  own  appraisal,  the  appraisal  of  their  supervisor,  or  the  appraisals  of  peers within their same position tier.   30  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 6.7.5.  Pay  Pool  Panel  Methodology.  Pay  Pool  Panel  members  will  review  each  appraisal within  the  category  to  which  they  are  assigned  and  must  consistently  apply  the  Air  Force appraisal system methodology.  The Pay Pool reports proposed changes to the rating official prior to finalizing Pay Pool deliberations. 6.7.5.1.  The Pay Pool Panel may adjust up or down a CSE’s ISR based on applying the performance standards in a fair and consistent manner. 6.7.5.2.  The  Pay  Pool  must  report  proposed  changes  to  the  rating  official  prior  to finalizing deliberations. 6.7.5.3.  Rating  officials  should  be  prepared  to  provide  immediate  feedback  that  may include additional evidence to substantiate the CSE’s ISR (if applicable). 6.7.5.4.  If a dispute between the rating official and the Pay Pool Panel exists regarding a change to the CSE’s  ISR, the PRB will make a final  determination based upon the Pay Pool Panel’s recommended results. 6.7.5.5.  In  the  event  changes  are  made  to  a  CSE’s  ISR  by  the  Pay  Pool,  that  affects overall  rating  levels,  the  Pay  Pool  manager  must  notify  the  CSE.    The  CSE  has  the opportunity  to  request  an  HLR  if  the  recommended  change  to  the  ISR  results  in  an increase/decrease  in  the  rating  level  (i.e.  Rating  Level  5  to  Rating  Level  4).    An  HLR review cannot be requested if changes in a score or shares do not result in a rating level change.  CSEs will have seven days from receipt of the change to initiate an HLR. 6.7.5.6.  The  Pay  Pool  may  approve  or  disapprove  recommendations  for  the  Total Performance Payout Adjustments. 6.7.6.  Performance  Review  Board  (PRB).  The  PRB  is  the  second  step  in  the  review process.    The  PRB  ensures  the  Pay  Pool  Panel  recommendations  were  applied  fairly  and consistently across the Pay Pools. 6.7.6.1.  Performance  Review  Board  (PRB)  Composition.  The  membership  will include GOs and Career SES members from the Air Force and other Components.  More than  one  half  of  the  PRB  members  must  be  Career  SES  appointees  and  the  PRB  Chair must be a 4-star GO. 6.7.6.2.  The SECAF must appoint, in writing, the membership of the PRB and the names of the board members must be recorded in the Federal Register.  The PRB panel members will be appointed in a manner to assure consistency, stability, and objectivity in assigning performance appraisal ratings. 6.7.6.3.  Members  of  the  PRB  cannot  participate  in  the  rating  or  scoring  of  their  own appraisal,    the  appraisal  of  their  supervisor  or  the  appraisals  of  peers  within  their  same position tier. 6.7.6.4.  The PRB must be established in a manner that precludes conflicts of interest. 6.7.7.  Performance  Review  Board  (PRB)  Methodology.  The  PRB  members  will  review appraisals and must consistently apply the Air Force appraisal methodology.  The PRB will consider  organizational  performance  and  CSE  member’s  individual  accomplishments.    The PRB will make written recommendations to the SECAF for final approval. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   31  6.7.7.1.  The PRB may adjust a CSE’s ISR up or down and must be based on applying the performance standards in a fair and consistent manner. 6.7.7.2.  The PRB reports proposed changes to the rating official prior to finalizing PRB deliberations. 6.7.7.3.  Rating  officials  should  be  prepared  to  provide  immediate  feedback  that  may include additional evidence to substantiate the CSE’s ISR (if applicable). 6.7.7.4.  If a dispute between the rating official and the PRB exists, the SECAF will make a final determination based upon the PRB’s performance payout recommended results. 6.7.7.5.  The  PRB  may  approve  or  disapprove  recommendations  for  Total  Performance Payout Adjustments. 6.7.8.  Authorizing  Official.  The  SECAF  has  final  approving  authority  for  the  Air  Force and ensures the recommendations of the PRB make meaningful distinctions based on relative performance  and  results  are  consistent  with  Subchapter  920,  Executive  and  Senior Professional  Pay  and  Performance  System  policy  guidelines.    The  SECAF  assures  that performance  pay  increases  and  performance  bonuses  accurately  reflect  and  recognize individual  performance  and  contributions  to  the  Air  Force  mission  performance.    The SECAF will determine the ASR and send to OSD for validation.  The authorizing official is the only one who can grant a recommended Total Performance Payout Adjustment. 6.7.9.  Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD).  Office of Secretary of Defense validates the Air Force’s final summary rating determinations recommended by the SECAF. 6.7.10.  Notification  of  Results.  After  SECAF  approval  and  OSD  certification  of  ASR, AFSEMO  will  provide  full  disclosure  to  the  CSE,  rating  official  and  reviewing  official  on individual  scoring  and  documentation.    AFSEMO  will  notify  AFPC  and  Defense  Financial Accounting Service to process all performance-based payout for all CSEs and professionals.  In addition, AFSEMO will provide aggregate results to the CSEs. 6.7.11.  Performance  Management  Requirements.  Further  guidance Subchapter 920, Executive and Senior Professional Pay and Performance System. is  outlined in   32  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 Chapter 7 PAY AND OTHER COMPENSATION 7.1.  Background.  CSE pay  and  compensation is based on a variety of factors and  conditions.  The foundation for all Air Force CSEs annual pay increases is tied to the Department’s pay-for-performance system.  The pay-for-performance system ensures a CSE’s pay is tied to the results achieved  during  the  performance  year  that  directly  links  to  accomplishment  of  the  Air  Force goals and mission.  In addition to the annual performance-based increases, Air Force CSEs may be  eligible  for  additional  compensation  during  appointment  or  reassignment  to  a  position  of greater  responsibility.    Note:  This  chapter  does  not  apply  to  PAS  members,  NC  SES  members and HQEs.  HQE pay and other compensation guidance is addressed separately in chapter 10 of this AFI. 7.2.  Pay Ranges.  The Air Force CSE pay range has a minimum rate of basic pay equal to 120 percent  of  the  basic  pay  rate  for  grade  GS-15  (step  1).    The  maximum  rate  of  basic  pay  is  the basic  pay  rate  for  Level  II  of  Executive  Schedule  (EX-II)  under  a  certified  performance management system. 7.2.1.  Annual  Rate  of  Pay.  The  applicable  maximum  rate  of  basic  pay  for  the  rate  range will  increase  with  any  Government-wide  increase  in  the  rate  for  the  EX.    The  adjustment usually occurs at the beginning of the first pay period beginning on or after  the first day of the month in which the GS rates are adjusted. 7.2.2.  Tier  Levels.  The  Air  Force  SES/DISES  positions  are  designated  in  a  three-tier structure as a means of ensuring comparability and transparency in SES/DISES positions and compensation management across the Department. 7.2.2.1.  Tier 1.  The maximum rate is equivalent to EX-III. 7.2.2.2.  Tier 2.  The maximum rate of basic pay for Tier 2 is equivalent to the midpoint between the maximum rate of basic pay of EX III and the maximum rate of basic pay of EX  II  (rounded  up  to  the  nearest  thousand)  under  a  certified  performance  management system. 7.2.2.3.  Tier 3.  The maximum rate of basic pay is equivalent to EX-II under a certified performance management system. 7.2.3.  The DISL/SL/ST positions are not assigned to tiers, but have a maximum rate of basic pay of EX-II under a certified performance system.  However, Air Force typically limits pay to EX-III. 7.2.4.  The SECAF approves all pay adjustments. 7.2.5.  Aggregate  Limitation  on  Pay.  Aggregate  limitation  on  pay  cannot  exceed  limits established in 5 USC Section 5307, Limitation on Certain Payments, for CSEs paid under 5 USC Section 5383, Setting Individual Senior Executive Pay.  The aggregate limit applies to basic  pay,  awards  (e.g.,  rank,  performance,  stipend  incentive),  recruitment  and  relocation bonuses,  retention  allowances  and  other  similar  payments.    Under  a  certified  performance management  system,  total  compensation  paid  to  a  CSE  during  a  calendar  year  may  not exceed  the  Vice  President’s  salary  at  the  end  of  the  calendar  year,  based  on  a  current  AF AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   33  certified  performance  management  system,  pursuant  to  5  CFR  Subpart  D,  Pay  and Performance  Awards  under  the  Senior  Executive  Service.    If  the  performance  management system  is  not  certified,  the  aggregate  limit  is  EX-I  in  accordance  with  5  CFR,  530.201(b), Aggregate Limitation on Pay. 7.3.  Setting  Pay.  Pay  is  set  based  upon  a  number  of  factors  that  includes  individual  and organizational  performance  results,  the  complexity  and  scope  of  work,  the  breadth  of responsibility, the CSE’s experience, pay history and qualifications. 7.3.1.  All  CSEs  basic  pay  is  exclusive  of  bonuses,  differentials  and  allowances.    An organization  may  adjust  the  rate  of  basic  pay  of  a  CSE  not  more  than  once  during  any  12-month period, except as provided by  5  CFR 534.404, Setting and Adjusting Pay for Senior Executives. 7.3.2.  Locality  pay  was  eliminated  for  SES/DISES  members  on  11  January  2004,  and  for DISL/SL/ST  members  on  12  April  2009.    Therefore,  all  pay  increases  are  now  based  on performance and all pay converted to a single base pay rate. 7.3.3.  New Accession.  Pay for new CSEs is generally set at a minimum of six percent above the appointee’s total  salary  or  at  the  floor of the  tier for the position the  new CSE is  being appointed to, whichever is greater. 7.3.3.1.  For Federal appointees, total salary excludes bonuses, allowances and awards. 7.3.3.2.  For  private  sector  appointees,  total  salary  excludes  bonuses,  allowances  and awards and other monetary incentives, e.g. stock options, company car etc. 7.3.3.3.  The ERB will recommend an appropriate starting salary for new CSEs, subject to SECAF approval. 7.3.3.4.  Organizations  may  submit  justification  for  increases  above  the  recommended percent. for  pay regarding  SES/DISES  members 7.3.4.  Transfer.  Consideration is  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  recommend transferring  from  different  agencies approval/disapproval to the SECAF, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay.  Generally, these increases may be justified by a comparison of the position at the losing agency to the position within the Air Force.  If the movement is determined to be to a higher tier, a pay increase may be appropriate. increases 7.3.4.1.  If  pay  is  set  at  the  same  SES  rate  the  SES/DISES  member  received  in  his/her former agency, the action is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying the 12-month rule. 7.3.4.2.  The SES/DISES members rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of applying 5 USC Section 3594, Guaranteed Placement In Other Personnel Systems  and  5  CFR  Part  359,  Subpart  G,  Guaranteed  Placement,  or  5  USC  Section 5363, Grade and Pay Retention, and 5 CFR Part 536, Subpart C, Pay Retention. 7.3.5.  Movement  Within  A  Tier.  The  ERB  will  consider  pay  increases  (reserved  for  rare and  unusual  circumstances)  for  movement  within  a  tier  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and recommend  approval/disapproval  to  the  SECAF.    Examples  may  include:    reassignments recommended as succession planning (where the SES/DISES member is being groomed for   34  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 greater levels of responsibility) or movement to positions for which candidates are generally not recruited from outside the SES corps. 7.3.6.  Movement  to  a  Higher  Tier.  Generally,  pay  for  reassignment  to  a  higher  tier  will result in a six percent increase to the SES/DISES member’s current salary.  For an increase greater  than  six  percent,  organizations  must  submit  justification  to  the  ERB  for  a recommendation to the SECAF for approval/disapproval. 7.3.7.  Movement to a Lower Tier.  When movement to a lower tier is done at the discretion of  the  authorizing  official  to  meet  organizational  needs  for  such  purposes  as  SES/DISES development,  the  SES/DISES  member  will  retain  his/her  salary  and  protocol  status  of  the higher tier position and will be grandfathered in the pay pool. 7.3.7.1.  When movement to a lower tier is at the request of the SES/DISES member (i.e., applied for the vacancy), the member will retain  his/her salary  and assume the protocol status of the lower tier position and will not be grandfathered in the position. 7.3.7.2.  When  movement  to  a  lower  tier  is  for  cause,  a  decrease  in  pay  for  the SES/DISES  member  will  be  considered  upon  receipt  of  a  minimally  successful  or unsatisfactory  ASR,  failure  to  meet  a  critical  performance  element,  and/or  disciplinary action. 7.3.8.  Maximum  Payable  Rate.  If  a  CSE  takes  a  position  in  the  GS  at  the  member’s request  and  is  not  eligible  for  saved  pay,  the  individual  may  be  paid  under  the  “maximum payable  rate”  rule,  as  determined  by  the  agency.    An  individual  serving  on  an  LTA  who returns  to  the  GS  is  not  eligible  for  retained  pay,  but  may  have  his/her  pay  set  under  the “maximum payable rate” rule, as determined by the agency.  It does not matter whether the return  to  GS  is  voluntary  or  is  the  result  of  a  management  decision.    However,  the  SES appointment must have been for more than 90 days, even though the appointee may have not actually served that long.  In determining the GS rate, agencies may take into account such factors as how long the individual served under the LTA and what the individual’s pay would have been had the individual remained in the GS. 7.4.  Pay  Flexibility.  The  Air  Force  has  discretionary  authority  to  provide  additional compensation  to  meet  pre-employment  interview  expenses,  travel  and  moving  costs  for  new appointees.  The Air Force may advance pay for new appointees up to two pay periods (unless the appointee is the agency head). 7.4.1.  Recruitment and Relocation.  The Air Force may pay, as a lump sum, a recruitment incentive to a newly appointed CSE if the agency has determined that the position is likely to be  difficult  to  fill  in  the  absence  of  an  incentive,  or  pay  a  relocation  incentive  to  a  current CSE  who  must  relocate  to  accept  a  position  in  a  different  geographic  area  if  the  agency determines that the position is likely to be difficult to fill in the absence of an incentive.  The amount (not to exceed 25 percent of base salary) must be recommended to the ERB and must be approved by the SECAF. 7.4.1.1.  To receive these incentives, an employee must sign an agreement to complete a period  of  service  with  the  agency.    Failure  to  complete  the  service  agreement  requires repayment on a pro rata basis.  These payments are not considered a part of basic pay but are included in the calculation on the limitation of aggregate basic pay. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   35  7.4.1.2.  A  relocation  incentive  may  be  paid  only  when  the  CSE’s  last  ASR  under  an official  performance  appraisal  or  evaluation  system  is  at  least  "Fully  Successful"  or equivalent,  but  the  relocation  incentive  is  included  for  the  limitation  of  aggregate  basic pay. 7.4.2.  Retention Payments.  The Air Force may pay a retention allowance (paid bi-weekly) of  up  to  25  percent  of  basic  pay  to  a  CSE  with  unusually  high  or  unique  qualifications,  or based  upon  the  special  need  of  the  Air  Force,  if  it  is  determined  the  CSE’s  skills  makes  it essential to retain the CSE in their current position during a period of time before the closure or relocation of the CSEs office, facility, activity or organization. 7.4.2.1.  Retention  payments  may  be  provided  if  the  Air  Force  determines  that  without the allowance the CSE would be likely to leave the Federal Government in the absence of a retention incentive, whether or not other employment is planned.  DV-4 and DV-5 are paid  20 percent  of their  basic pay, and a DV-6 is paid  15 percent.   These payments  are not considered a part of basic pay but are included in the calculation on the limitation of aggregate basic pay. 7.4.2.2.  A  retention  incentive  may  be  paid  only  when  the  CSE’s  last  ASR  is  at  least "Fully Successful" or equivalent. 7.5.  Total  Performance  Payout.  Under  a  DoD  certified  performance  management  system, CSE pay adjustments must be linked to performance.  Payouts are either as a performance-based salary increase and/or a performance-based bonus and are subject to the availability of funds.  A DoD  certified  performance  appraisal  system  makes  meaningful  distinctions  based  on  relative performance and links an individual’s pay to results that contribute to mission accomplishment. 7.5.1.  Limited  Term  Appointment for performance-based  bonuses  but  can  receive  a  performance-based  pay  raise.    Limited  Term Appointment  member  salaries  are  included  in  the  Pay  Pool  since  they  are  eligible  for performance-based basic pay increases. (LTA).  LTA  members  are  not  eligible 7.5.2.  Pay  Rules  for  Less  Than  a  Full  Cycle.  The  Air  Force  uses  optional  Total Performance Payout Adjustment (proration) for members with less than a full year of service (12  months).    This  does  not  apply  to  members  serving  in  CSE  positions  in  other  Federal Agencies prior to reassignment to the Air Force. 7.5.2.1.  New CSEs are prorated based on the ratio of the year completed. 7.5.2.2.  New  CSEs  with  less  than  90  days  on  a  performance  plan  (appointment  after  3 July or later) are not rated in the Pay Pool Panel or PRB of the same year.  They are not eligible for any pay adjustments or bonuses from the Air Force until the following year.  However, the CSE’s salary will be included in the pay pool. 7.5.3.  Annual  Closeout  Guidance.  OSD the performance  management  system  to  ensure  consistency  across  the  Department.    The guidance  covers  Pay  Pool  funding,  compensation  rules,  organizational  assessment  and evaluation procedures. issues  annual  closeout  guidance  for 7.5.3.1.  Pay Pool Funding Factor.  OSD determines the Pay Pool Funding Factor which is  the  sum  of  three  variables:    President’s  Adjustment  to  Executive  Pay  (PAEP);  Pay Progression Budget (pay increases); and Performance Bonus Budget (bonuses).   36  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 7.5.3.1.1.  The  SECAF  determines  how  funds  will  be  split  between  Pay  Progression Budget (pay increases) and Performance Bonus Budget (bonuses) and approves CSE pay changes based on OSD guidance. 7.5.3.1.2.  Unspent  funds  from  the  Pay  Progression  Budget  may  be  moved  to  the Performance Bonus Budget.  However, none of the amount budgeted for bonuses may be used to pay performance pay increases. 7.5.3.1.3.  The amount of performance bonuses paid may not exceed 10 percent of the total aggregate basic pay of the Career CSEs on board as of 30 September prior to the FY in which the award payments are made. 7.5.3.2.  Pay Pool Funding.  The Pay Pool Funding will be determined by the sum of all CSE’s  salaries  (including  NC  and  LTA  members)  on  the  rolls  as  of  30  September  and then multiplied by the Pay Pool  Funding Factor.  Pay Pool  Funding Factors are defined for each tier level. 7.5.3.2.1.  Only those CSEs on a performance plan for a minimum of 90 days (prior to  30  September)  will  be  rated  by  the  Pay  Pool  Panel  and  PRB  and  are  eligible  to receive a performance-based payout. 7.5.3.2.2.  Performance  payouts  will  be  calculated  and  administered  so  that  payouts do not exceed the resources that are available in the Pay Pool. 7.5.4.  Determining  Number of Shares.  Shares are the first step in linking performance to payout.    Shares  are  a  notional  representation  of  a  portion  of  the  Pay  Pool,  which  allows mathematical  computation  of  individual  performance  payouts.    Shares  are  assigned  as  a result of the final performance score and are the basis on which individuals earn an increase to basic pay, a performance bonus, or both.  Using the Performance Rating Level, Scores and shares for Payout Share Conversion Chart found in  Table 7.1, the number of earned shares corresponds directly to the CSEs performance rating and performance score.  The PRB Score Table is reviewed annually by the ERB and is subject to change. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   37  Table 7.1.  Performance Rating Level, Score and Shares for Payout Share Conversion Chart. Performance Review Board Score Table Rating Unsatisfactory Minimally Satisfactory Achieved Expectations Exceeds Expected Results Exceptional Results 1 2 Rating Level  Score 0-50 51-69 70-71 72-74 75-77 78-79 80-83 84-85 86-91 Share 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 3 4 5 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 7.5.4.1.  CSEs  must  have  an  Annual  Performance  Rating  of  “Achieved  Expectations” (based on an overall performance score of at least 70, or the equivalent) to be considered for a performance payout.  In addition, CSEs must have at least “Achieved Expectations” for all PEs to be eligible for a performance payout. 7.5.4.2.  The number of shares earned by a CSE will be used to calculate the performance payout of a CSE by multiplying the number of shares by the Share Value. 7.5.4.3.  If grandfathered in accordance with the tier policy, CSEs serving in a tier lower than previously assigned will be paid using the Share Value of the higher tier. 7.5.5.  Determining the Share Value.  The Share Value (for a single share) is determined by each member’s basic pay multiplied by the number of shares awarded to the CSE.  The total Pay  Pool  value  is  then  divided  by  the  aggregate  total  of  (salary  x  shares)  for  all  CSEs  to calculate the Share Value.  The computed Share Value is a percentage. 7.5.6.  Formula  for  the Total  Performance  Payout.  A CSE’s total performance payout is calculated  by  multiplying  the  member’s  current  salary  by  the  individual  number  of  shares earned  and  then  multiplied  by  the  Share  Value.    This  calculation  will  result  in  a  dollar amount that represents the total amount of performance payout a CSE has earned. 7.5.7.  Elements  of  the  Total  Performance  Payout.  The  amount  of  Total  Performance Payout  money  available  for  the  CSE  is  divided  into  two  elements:    basic  pay  increase  and performance bonus.   38  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 7.5.7.1.  Determining  a  Basic  Pay  Increase.  The  basic  pay  increase  is  the  pay  raise portion of the Total Performance Payout.  A CSE’s pay raise opportunity is driven by the final performance rating.  It is an Air Force policy that the highest ratings should receive the  highest  percentage  of  a  basic  pay  increase.    Using  the  sample  Performance  Rating Level  Basic  Pay  Increase  for  Payout  Conversion  Chart  found  in  Table  7.2,  the  rating level  corresponds  directly  to  the  CSE’s  basic  pay  increase  and  is  reviewed  annually  by the ERB and may be modified. Table 7.2.  Sample Performance Rating Level Basic Pay Increase for Payout Conversion Chart. Performance Rating Level Exceptional Results Exceeds Expected Results Achieved Expectations Minimally Satisfactory Unsatisfactory 4 3 2 1 Rating  Basic Pay Increase 5 (SES/DISES/SL/ST/DISL)  PAEP + 3 percent (SES/DISES/SL/ST/DISL)  PAEP + 1 percent (SES/DISES/SL/ST/DISL)  PAEP N/A N/A 7.5.7.1.1.  Basic  pay  increases  are  generally  effective  the  first  full  pay  period  in January. 7.5.7.1.2.  Members  in  a  grandfathered  status  will  not  have  their  pay  raises  capped unless they are at EX-II pay.  They will meet the PRB based on current position. 7.5.7.2.  Determining  a  Performance-Based  Bonus.  The  performance  bonus  is  the lump sum portion of the Total Performance Payout awarded to the CSE at the end of the calendar  year.    Note:    Basic  pay  increase  monies  are  first  removed  from  the  Total Performance  Payout  amount  and  then  the  remainder  is  awarded  as  the  performance bonus.  The performance bonus is considered  a “rating-based” cash award. 7.5.7.2.1.  Rating-based  cash  awards  above  $25,000  for  DISL/SL/ST  members require White House approval and must be routed through OSD.  This restriction does not apply for SES/DISES members. 7.5.7.2.2.  DISL/SL/ST member bonuses normally will not  exceed 10  percent  of the annual rate of basic pay.  Exceptional performance by the member may justify up to 20 percent. 7.5.7.2.3.  SES/DISES  member  bonuses  must  be  between  5  and  20  percent  of  basic pay.  If an adjustment decreases the amount of a bonus, the resulting bonus cannot be less  than  5  percent  of  the  SES/DISES  member’s  salary.    This  restriction  does  not apply to SL/ST and DISL members. 7.5.7.2.4.  If an adjustment is made to a CSE’s performance bonus the combined total (the original bonus amount plus the adjusted amount to include the Total Performance Pay Adjustment) cannot exceed 20 percent of the member’s salary. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   39  7.5.8.  Total  Performance  Payout  Adjustments.  An  increase  or  decrease  to  the  proposed basic  pay  increase  and/or  performance  bonus  as  calculated  by  the  Performance  Payout formula  determined  by  the  SECAF.    The  Total  Performance  Payout  Adjustment  is  an adjustment only, not a separate cash award, such as a special act or incentive award. 7.5.8.1.  The decision to make an adjustment to a CSE’s Total Performance Payout must be  done  in  a  judicious  and  prudent  manner.    It  must  be  documented  in  writing  and  can only  be  approved  by  the  SECAF.    However,  it  may  be  recommended  by  the  rating official, Pay Pool Panel and/or PRB. 7.5.8.2.  A Total Performance Payout Adjustment increase may be made for reasons such as recognizing rare and unusual circumstances in which an CSE achieves “Extraordinary Results”  above  that  which  the  Performance  Payout  Formula  provides.    It  may  also recognize  a  significant in  meeting  an organization’s strategic goal. team  accomplishment  or  achievement 7.5.8.3.  A  Total  Performance  Payout  Adjustment  decrease  may  be  made  for  the following reasons: 7.5.8.3.1.  Proration.  Members  with  less  than  a  full  year  of  service  (12  months) during  the  performance  appraisal  period  will  have  their  Total  Performance  Payout decreased based on the ratio of the year completed.   This does not apply to members who were serving in CSE positions in other Federal agencies prior to reassignment to the Air Force. 7.5.8.3.2.  Recent  hiring  action  (e.g.,  within  the  performance  cycle)  in  which  a significant pay increase was granted upon appointment, reassignment or transfer. 7.5.8.3.3.  To comply with the aggregate Pay Pool funding limits imposed by statute, regulation or by DoD. 7.5.8.3.4.  If  an  adjustment  decreases  the  amount  of  a  bonus  of  a  member  of  the SES/DISES,  the  resulting  bonus  cannot  be  less  than  five  percent  of  the  member’s salary.   40  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 Chapter 8 AWARDS AND OTHER RECOGNITION 8.1.  Background.  The  law  authorizes  agencies  to  grant  special  recognition,  awards  and incentive  payments  to  CSEs  to  help  attract,  retain,  recognize,  reward,  and  motivate  highly competent CSE members.  Monetary forms of recognition include performance awards (bonuses) and honorary incentive awards (DoD and Presidential).  By DoD policy, only Career appointees are  eligible  for  performance  awards  and  the  PRA.    CSEs  are  not  eligible  for  monetary  Special Act  or  Service  awards.    Non-monetary  forms  of  recognition  include  Campaign  and  Service awards.  Approval authority for non-monetary awards is outlined in AFI 36-1004, Table 5.1 The Air Force Civilian Recognition Program, 3 December 2009.  Note:  This chapter does not apply to PAS, NC SES members and HQEs. 8.2.  Monetary  Awards.  These  awards  are  recognized  with  compensation  subject  to  the aggregate limitation on pay.  Total compensation paid to a CSE member during a calendar year, to  include  allowances,  differentials,  bonuses,  awards  or  other  similar  cash  payments  may  not exceed  EX-I,  or  the  Vice  President’s  salary,  at  the  end  of  the  calendar  year,  under  a  certified performance management system. 8.2.1.  Performance-Based  Bonus.  The  SECAF,  as  the  authorizing  official,  determines performance  awards  for  all  Air  Force  CSEs  based  on  recommendations  from  the  PRB  in accordance  with  Chapter  6,  Performance  Management  for  eligibility  and  Chapter  7,  Pay and Other Compensation for monetary compensation amounts. 8.2.2.  Presidential  Rank  Award  (PRA).  The  PRA  is  the  most  prestigious  recognition awarded  to  CSEs.    It  is  restricted  to  those  in  Career  status  only.      Career  CSEs  may  be recognized  for  exceptional  performance  over  an  extended  period  of  time.    CSEs  serving  in NC  appointments,  LTAs,  and  PAS  are  not  eligible  for  a  PRA.    As  PRAs  recognize performance over an extended period of time, CSEs whose performance is exceptional for at least three years may be nominated for one of two Presidential rank levels: Distinguished or Meritorious. 8.2.2.1.  The  Distinguished  PRA  recognizes  sustained  extraordinary  accomplishment.  Distinguished recipients receive a lump-sum payment of 35 percent of their rate of annual basic pay, a gold pin, and a framed certificate signed by the President.  The Distinguished rank  is  awarded  to  one  percent  or  less  of  Career  CSEs  Government-wide  for  sustained extraordinary accomplishments. 8.2.2.2.  The  Meritorious  PRA  recognizes  sustained  accomplishment.    Meritorious recipients receive a lump-sum payment of 20 percent of their rate of annual basic pay, a silver  pin,  and  a  framed  certificate  signed  by  the  President.    The  Meritorious  rank  is awarded  to  five  percent  or  less  of  Career  CSEs  Government-wide  for  sustained accomplishments. 8.2.2.3.  There  is  no  restriction  on  receiving  a  meritorious  award  before  receiving  a distinguished award.  A CSE may not  receive the same award more than once in  a five year period. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   41  8.2.2.4.  CSEs  are  eligible  to  receive  a  PRA  and  a  performance  bonus  in  the  same calendar  year.    It  is  inappropriate  to  deny  or  reduce  a  performance  award  solely  on  the basis of receiving a PRA during the same year. 8.2.2.5.  AFSEMO  annually  issues  calls  for  nominations.    Two  separate  nomination processes occur:  one for Career SES/SL/ST and one for Career DISES/DISL. 8.2.2.5.1.  Only HAF 2-ltr officials/MAJCOM/ Combatant Commanders may submit nominations to  AFSEMO.  Specific guidance for content of award packages will be provided when the call for nominations occurs. limits  on 8.2.2.5.2.  There  are  no the  number  of  nominees  a  HAF  2-ltr official/MAJCOM/ Combatant Commander can submit; however, there should be no more than one Distinguished nominee for every five Meritorious nominees submitted.  Nominees should have demonstrated progression of performance accomplishments by receipt of performance awards prior to nomination. 8.2.2.6.  A  Presidential  Rank  Award  Panel  (PRAP)  is  composed  of  members  appointed by the SECAF to consider nominations annually.  The PRAP is chaired by a 3 or 4-star GO  or  SES  equivalent.    The  Board  members  are  typically  selected  from  previous  PRA winners. 8.2.2.6.1.  There is  one  PRAP  board for  Air  Force SES/SL/ST members.  Air  Force nominees  are  selected  and  their  names  are  forwarded  to  OSD  for  consideration.  Nominations are then sent to OPM for Government-wide screening and forwarded for Presidential approval. 8.2.2.6.2.  There  is  a  separate  PRAP  board  submission  process  for  DISES/DISL  Air Force  nominees.    This  board  is  composed  primarily  of  members  of  the  Intelligence community.    Air  Force  nominees  are  selected  and  forwarded  to  the  Director  of Administration  and  Management  for  consideration  and  final  selection  by  the SECDEF.    The  SECDEF  forwards  the  nominations  to  the  White  House  for Presidential approval. 8.2.2.7.  AFSEMO notifies appropriate authorities of PRA recipients.  The SECAF hosts a ceremony and reception honoring the Air Force PRA recipients. 8.2.2.8.  Public  release  of  PRA  recipients  (e.g.,  website,  newsletter,  newspaper)  is  not authorized  until  the  President  officially  announces  the  winners  and  AFSEMO  receives OPM and OSD authorization. 8.3.  Non-Monetary Awards.  Non-monetary awards are appropriate for special acts or service. Non-government  organizations  may  present  non-monetary  awards  to  recognize  outstanding executive  achievements.    Non-monetary  awards,  eligibility  requirements  and  nomination procedures are found in AFI 36-1004.  These awards are not presented in lieu of a performance-based bonus or in addition to a performance-based bonus for the same accomplishment.   42  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 Chapter 9 TALENT MANAGEMENT AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT 9.1.  Talent Management.  Talent management is a deliberate process used to manage the career lifecycle of SES/DISES members.  Talent management builds a leadership talent pool to ensure continuity to execute the Air Force mission without interruptions that may be created by position vacancies.  The Air Force provides an annual corporate assessment of leadership and utilization potential based on the results of performance and competency based readiness assessments of all Career SES/DISES members to identify candidates for positions of increased responsibility and developmental  opportunities.    The  talent  management  process  allows  the  Air  Force  to  identify and  develop  a  bench  of  SES/DISES  talent  with  an  enterprise,  joint  and  national  security perspective.    Note:    This  chapter  does  not  apply  to  DISL/SL/ST/PAS/NC  SES  members  and HQE’s. 9.2.  Talent Pool.  The talent pool consists of all Career SES/DISES members.  The SES/DISES members  are  provided  the  opportunity  for  varied/competitive  job-based  experiences  and continuous career development through the TMB which is a succession planning process. 9.2.1.  Self Assessment/Executive Profile.  Annually, SES/DISES members complete a self-assessment  as  part  of  the  overall  talent  management  process.    This  self-assessment  is accomplished through and maintained in the Defense Talent Management System (DTMS).  DTMS  includes  an  executive  profile  about  the  SES/DISES  member’s  current  position,  job history, preferences for position movement, competency assessments, education, awards and prior year performance appraisal. 9.2.2.  AFSEMO  is  the  Office  of  Primary  Responsibility  (OPR)  for  DTMS  and  allows SES/DISES  members  the  opportunity  to  update  information,  as  necessary,  on  their  current duties,  most  significant  career  accomplishments  and  other  required  information.    The  self-assessment/executive  profile  is  reviewed  by  the  rater  and  endorser  of  the  SES/DISES member to provide input to the TMB.  MAJCOM/COCOM Commanders and HAF/SAF 2-letters must serve as the Endorsers for all of their SES/DISES members in DTMS in order to provide the big-picture view of executive potential within their organization. 9.3.  Talent  Management  Board  (TMB).  AFSEMO  facilitates  the  TMB  on  behalf  of  the SECAF.    The  TMB  is  chaired  by  a  four  star  GO  and  the  members  are  comprised  of  an appropriate mix of Career SES/DISES  and GOs.  The chair and members are appointed by the SECAF.    The  board  conducts  SES/DISES  member  readiness  assessments,  utilizes  performance data  to  identify  potential  candidates  for  future  vacancies  and  develop  succession  management plans.    The  TMB  convenes  during  the  third  quarter  of  each  FY.    All  TMB  deliberations  are confidential. 9.3.1.  Assessment.  A  common  means  of  evaluating  all  Tier  1  and  Tier  2  SES/DISES member’s  executive  competency  level  based  on  multiple  performance  indicators  including performance  history,  career  chronology  and  pre-determined  competency  ratings.    This  is  a two-part  process  to  provide  both  a  near  and  long  term  assessment.    The  Air  Force SES/DISES leadership and utilization potential are assessed/grouped by Tier 1 and 2. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   43  9.3.1.1.  Readiness  Rating.  Using a decision matrix, a readiness rating is assigned after a  review  of  performance  and  a  TMB  agreed  level  of  future  potential.    The  readiness rating is used for deliberate succession management and the assignment of development priorities.  There are four possible readiness ratings: 9.3.1.1.1.  Ready  for  Increased  Challenge.  Member is ready now for a position of greater scope, impact, complexity, responsibility of institutional importance. 9.3.1.1.2.  Ready  for  Career  Broadening.  Member  is  ready  now  to  move  into  a position  of  equivalent  scope,  impact,  complexity,  responsibility,  and  authority  that offers different challenges and provides growth. 9.3.1.1.3.  Build Tenure/Experience.  On track or recently assigned. 9.3.1.1.4.  Contribute  In-Place.  Member  occupies  a  highly  specialized,  unique  or niche position creating a need for continuity. 9.3.1.2.  Transferability.  The  TMB  is  used  to  identify  and  understand  the  skills  and competencies  available  within  the  SES/DISES  community  to  ensure  visibility  of  talent; and  promote  career  opportunities  within  the  Air  Force  and  across  DoD  to  maximize transferability.    The  Air  Force  requires  its  corps  of  SES/DISES  members  to  be  mobile with the understanding they may be reassigned to meet shifting Air Force priorities.  The Air  Force  supports  this  requirement  by  developing  SES/DISES  members  through  a structured  series  of  well-planned  developmental  and  educational  experiences,  often including  reassignments  to  more  challenging  positions.    The  objective  of  position mobility  is  to  develop  SES/DISES  members  with  strong  skills  to  lead  and  operate effectively  across  organizational  and  functional  boundaries,  enterprise-spanning perspectives and deepen knowledge of joint/interagency matters.  Upon SECAF approval of the TMB results, SES/DISES members and their rater, and/or endorser will be notified that  a  readiness  rating  of  “ready  for  increased  challenge”  or  “ready  for  career broadening” may result in a referral for opportunities enterprise-wide within the next 12 months. 9.3.1.3.  The  TMB  shall  match  SES/DISES  members experiences. to  critical  developmental 9.3.1.4.  The outcome of TMB deliberations shall be approved by the SECAF as the final authorizing  official.    The  SECAF  will  ensure  compliance  with  succession  management policies  issued  by  DoD  and  submit  endorsed  assessments  and  goals  annually  to  the Defense Executive Advisory Board through its representatives. 9.3.2.  Talent  Management  Board  (TMB)  Feedback.  AFSEMO  ensures  all  SES/DISES members are notified of their TMB results via a signed memorandum from the SECAF.   The memorandum  details  the  readiness  rating.    A  copy  of  this  memorandum  is  provided  to endorsing  officials  informing  them  of  the  readiness  ratings  of  members  within  their command; positions slates and information on the positions that “their” SES/DISES members were  slated  for  within  the  next  12  months.    This  is  facilitated  in  the  form  of  feedback  to promote self-examination and assessment for continuous development. 9.3.2.1.  AFSEMO will provide SES/DISES members with their personal readiness rating and the definition of each readiness rating.   44  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 9.3.2.2.  Supervisors will provide timely feedback to SES/DISES members regarding the outcomes of the TMB process. 9.3.2.3.  Feedback  is  a  shared  responsibility;  however,  this  annual  feedback  should always be initiated by the supervisor. 9.3.2.4.  Feedback  will  address  how  the  SES/DISES  members  can  achieve  career  goals; how  to  broaden  capabilities;  how  to  advance  and  contribute  more  fully  to  the  mission; and how to create a meaningful Executive Development Plan (EDP), refer to item 9.5.1 9.3.2.5.  Feedback regarding a readiness rating or succession plan cannot  be challenged, but SES/DISES members may solicit clarification of the assessment through the chain of command. 9.3.2.6.  Feedback provides SES/DISES  members with  insight  on others’ perceptions of his/her capabilities and competencies. 9.3.2.7.  Feedback shall be relevant and actionable. 9.4.  Succession  Planning.  A  method  of  strategic  planning  for  all  Air  Force  SES/DISES positions  and  SES/DISES  members  based  on  the  TMB’s  analysis  of  the  competency  gaps between  the  members  capabilities  and  needs.    Succession  planning  is  a  multi-year,  multi-level, cross-functional  and  enterprise-wide  system  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  SES/DISES  talent  and develop the SES/DISES talent pool.  Organizational succession planning identifies and develops a bench of talent strength, then develops SES/DISES members early to meet long-term needs. 9.4.1.  Position  Planning.  Multi-year  succession  planning  recognizes  that  SES/DISES positions  are  too  critical  to  be  left  vacant  or  filled  by  anyone  other  than  the  best  prepared SES/DISES  members.    Assigned  readiness  ratings  are  used  to  assess,  identify  and  present qualified candidates for specific SES/DISES positions based on the TMB’s assessment of an individual’s ability to take on greater responsibility. 9.4.2.  A  summary  of  all  succession  plans  is  reviewed  to  identify  gaps  in  bench  strength across  the  Air  Force;  analyze  staffing  patterns  and  enterprise-wide  gaps;  and  make recommendations to address gaps, weaknesses, threats and opportunities, as needed. 9.4.2.1.  Each Tier 3 and Tier 2 position in the succession plan is  slated for the next  12 months and succession plans developed for subsequent years. 9.4.2.2.  Succession  plans  will  be  developed  for  all  Tier  2  and  “draft”  slates  for  Tier  3 positions for review at CORONA. 9.4.2.3.  Succession  plans  will  be  validated  for  Tier  1  positions  as  “developmental”  or “entry”. 9.4.2.4.  Succession  plans  will  be  created  and  refreshed  annually  and  mid-year  as  a minimum. 9.4.2.5.  Succession plans will be comprehensive, and multi-year, by position/function. 9.4.2.6.  Succession  plans  may  be  shared  across  the  Department  to  inform  other Component SES/DISES members. 9.4.2.7.  Succession plans will use competency information for analysis and identification of developmental gaps within the Air Force. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   45  9.4.2.8.  Position slates for the next 12 months will be shared with the owning HAF 2-ltr officials/MAJCOM/Combatant Commanders, for their positions only. 9.4.2.9.  Readiness  ratings  for  SES/DISES  members  with  “Ready  for  Increased Challenge,”  “Ready  for  Career  Broadening”  will  be  shared  with  HAF  2-ltr officials/MAJCOM/Combatant  Commanders  to  inform  them  that  these  individuals  may be referred for other positions in the next 12 months.  AFSEMO will use the slates and ratings to build the referral listings. 9.5.  Career  Development.  The  Air  Force’s  goal  is  to  provide  high  potential  SES/DISES members  with  targeted  and  specialized  development  opportunities  focused  on  meeting  current and  future  corporate  needs  as  identified  by  annual  succession  planning.    Owning  organizations have  an  inherent  responsibility  for  providing  functional  or  development  training  for  their SES/DISES  members.    Note:    There  is  no  requirement  to  provide  development  training  for DISL/SL/ST members. 9.5.1.  Executive  Development  Plans  (EDPs).  To  assist  with  career  development,  EDPs must be prepared for all SES/DISES members.  An EDP is a detailed guide of development activities  to  help  SES/DISES  members,  through  participation  in  short-term  and  long-term experiences, meet organizational needs for leadership, managerial improvement and results. 9.5.1.1.  The  EDP  will  include  career  broadening  and  developmental  education  needs, based  upon  feedback  from  the  TMB.    The  EDP  will  address  enhancement  of  executive competencies,  and  outline  developmental  opportunities  and  assignments  that  allow  the individual to develop a broader perspective in the agency as well as enterprise-wide. 9.5.1.2.  Senior  leadership  provides  perspective  by  validating  each  EDP  within  their rating  chain.    The  EDPs  will  be  monitored  and  updated  annually.    Note:    There  is  no requirement  for  DISL/SL/ST  members  to  develop  EDPs.    DISL/  SL/ST  members  are considered to possess the requisite skills associated with the level and position for which they were hired and are therefore not considered for development. 9.5.2.  Centrally-Managed  Development  Opportunities.  AFSEMO  executes  the  Senior Leader Development Portfolio.  The portfolio of these executive-level development courses is published by AF/A1 and managed by AF/A1D. 9.5.2.1.  Selection  Methodology.  SES/DISES  members  are  identified  as  potential candidates for developmental opportunities, as a result of succession planning during the annual  TMB.   This  strategic approach is  applied to  maximize the Air Force’s return on investment, rather than using a nominative or self-identification process.  Limited budget and developmental opportunities drive a selective process  focusing on the identification of  highly  competitive  candidates.    Therefore,  the  Air  Force  selects  those  SES/DISES members  who  demonstrate  potential  to  assume  higher  levels  of  responsibility  and  to address competencies. 9.5.2.1.1.  General  Selection  Criteria.  Only  SES/DISES  member  records  are individually reviewed to identify gaps, avoid duplication, and ultimately match them to appropriate development opportunities.   46  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 9.5.2.1.2.  Budgetary  constraints  may  limit  the  availability  of  course  allocations.  Primary and alternate candidates are identified based on outcomes from the TMB and the available number of  allocations.  Once identified as a primary  for  a course, it is imperative SES/DISES members make every effort to attend. 9.5.2.2.  Interest-Based/Voluntary/Nominative  Courses.  AFSEMO  annually  receives course  allocations  for  courses  which  may  be  filled  via  self-nomination.    These  courses may be specific to a functional area or provide a general level of executive development.  AFSEMO  will  advertise  these  opportunities  and  accept  nominations  with  specific response timelines. 9.5.2.3.  External  Courses.  Each year, AFSEMO receives a limited number of external opportunities from DoD, other Components or Federal agencies to provide attendees for specialized  programs  or  courses  not  contained  in  the  Senior  Leader  Development Portfolio.    The  courses  are  specific  to  a  functional  area  or  provide  a  general  level  of executive development.    These courses may be filled deliberately from the outcomes of the  TMB  or  may  allow  for  self-nomination.    As  appropriate,  AFSEMO  will  advertise these opportunities and accept  nominations with  specific response timelines.  AFSEMO will  review  records  to  identify  gaps,  avoid  duplication  and  ultimately  match  the SES/DISES members appropriately. 9.5.2.4.  Funding.  Central SES/DISES members. funding  of  development  opportunities is limited to 9.5.2.5.  Cancellation/Withdrawal  Policy.  Once  an  SES/DISES  member  is  confirmed and  notified  for  a  specific  course,  senior  leader  policy  requires  any  cancellation  or withdrawal  from  the  course  must  include  a  written  justification,  signed  by  the MAJCOM/CV  or  Air  Staff  2-ltr  equivalent  official.    Requests  for  withdrawal  will  be forwarded to AFSEMO for action. 9.5.2.6.  Executive  Orientation.  To  assist  in  the  transition  to  both  the  Executive  Corps and  the  Air  Force,  mandatory  courses  are  identified  for  newly  appointed  SES/DISES members.    SES/  DISES  members  who  transfer  to  the  Air  Force  will  be  admitted  to  the courses on a space available basis.   The target window for completion of these courses is within the first 18 months of appointment. 9.5.3.  Sabbaticals.  The  SECAF  may  approve  a  sabbatical  for  up  to  11  months  to  SES appointees  for  full-time  study  or  uncompensated  work  experience  which  will  contribute  to their  development  and  effectiveness.    A  member  may  have  only  one  sabbatical  in  any  10-year period.  To be eligible for a sabbatical, the member must have completed seven years of Federal Civil Service at the SES (or equivalent) level, with at least two of the seven years in the  SES;  must  not  be  eligible  for  optional  retirement  as  of  the  time  the  sabbatical  begins; must have a rating of “exceeds expected results” on latest  performance appraisal;  and must agree  to  remain  in  Federal  Civil  Service  for  two  consecutive  years  after  completion  of  the sabbatical. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   47  Chapter 10 HIGHLY QUALIFIED EXPERTS 10.1.  Background.  HQEs  are  senior-level  Excepted  Service  Government  employees  who possess  expert  knowledge  or  skills  generally  not  available  within  DoD.    They  are  utilized  to satisfy a relatively non-permanent, short-term requirement. 10.2.  Highly  Qualified  Expert  (HQE)  Appointment.  HQEs can be appointed for a period of five  years.    Air  Force  policy  limits  initial  appointments  to  no  more  than  three  years;  however, appointments can be extended for up to two years.  In extenuating circumstances, a waiver may be obtained to  extend an HQE for one  additional  year.  The initial  appointment  and extensions shall not exceed six years. 10.3.  Highly  Qualified  Expert  (HQE)  Duties.  HQEs  may  mentor,  lead,  oversee,  direct, manage and consult on DoD programs and initiatives.  If an HQE’s responsibilities will include supervisory or managerial duties, these duties must be approved by the ERB. 10.4.  Precedence  Priority  Codes  and  Position  Tiers.  OSD  periodically  publishes  updates  to the Order of Precedence list, which provides the relative protocol precedence for members within DoD.    CSEs  are  not  stratified  by  grade;  therefore,  position  and  pay  structure  distinctions  for CSEs  necessitates  some  order  of  precedence.    For  protocol  purposes,  order  of  precedence  is accomplished in the Air Force through DV codes.  For DV codes, refer to chapter 2, item 2.5.2. 10.5.  Recruitment and Selection.  The hiring organization must conduct their own recruitment search and identify potential HQE candidates.  Candidates must possess substantive knowledge, skills,  experience,  and/or  education  along  with  a  proven  ability  in  the  particular  occupational field. 10.5.1.  The  ERB  approves  the  qualifications  of  all  HQE  candidates.    The  SECAF  has delegated authority to SAF/AA to approve the appointments and extension of appointments for all HQEs. 10.5.2.  Requesting  officials  submit  the  following  documentation  to  AFSEMO  for  the establishment  of  an  HQE  position:    PD;  performance  plan;  resume  of  proposed  candidate (see  Attachment  7);  and  an  executive  summary  of  the  HQE  requirement  (see  Attachment 8). 10.6.  Former Civil or Uniformed Service Employees. 10.6.1.  Intervening  Period  of  Service.  Former Civil or Uniformed Service employees are required to have a 30-day break in service prior to an appointment as an HQE.  In situations where  a  recent  Civil  or  Uniformed  Service  employee  is  selected  as  an  HQE  candidate,  the experience  they  possess  must  be  an  uncommon  level  of  expertise.    These  types  of appointments should occur only in exceptionally compelling instances.  These appointments are subject to a pre-appointment staffing review by the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Civilian  Personnel  Policy,  after  the  ERB  recommends  approval.    This  review  does  not apply to Senior Mentor appointments.   48  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 10.6.2.  Retired Federal Civil Service Employees.  Retired Federal Civil Service employees who  do  not  possess  an  uncommon  level  of  expertise  and  recognition  required  for  an  HQE appointment  shall  be  appointed  as  Reemployed  Annuitants  under  the  provisions  of  DoD Instruction  1400.25,  Volume  300,  DoD  Civilian  Personnel  Management  System: Employment of Federal Civilian Annuitants in the Department of Defense. 10.7.  Funding  and  Manpower.  The  gaining unit’s organization must fund the HQE position.  Any  HQE  salary  drawn  from  civilian  pay  accounts  will  be  reimbursed  from  Operations  and Maintenance accounts as chosen by the hiring MAJCOM in accordance with standard financial regulations and policies.  The Air Force does not require manpower or billet numbers for HQE positions,  as  they  are  temporary.    This  does  not  preclude  an  organization  from  assigning  a manpower or billet number. 10.8.  Compensation.  In  addition  to  basic  pay,  HQE  employees  may  receive  additional compensation to include locality pay, recruitment, relocation and retention incentives, subject to limitations established under 5 USC, Section 9903 (d), Attracting Highly Qualified Experts. 10.8.1.  Basic  Pay.  The  HQE  basic  rate  of  pay  may  range  from  GS-15,  Step  1  times  120 percent to EX-IV.  Hourly rate of pay is based on 2,087 hours annually. 10.8.2.  Locality  Pay.  The  Air  Force  may  pay  locality  pay:  however,  the  HQE’s  total  pay (basic rate of pay plus locality pay) cannot  exceed the statutory limit of EX-III.   Since the total pay cannot exceed these limits, when the HQE is eligible for locality-based pay, basic pay must be adjusted to ensure it is within the statutory caps. 10.8.3.  Aggregate Limitation on Pay.  Under a certified performance management system, in any calendar year, the aggregate annual compensation (basic pay, locality, and bonus pay) cannot exceed the salary of the Vice President.  If the performance management system is not certified, the aggregate statutory limit is EX-I in accordance with 5 CFR, Part 530.201(b). 10.8.4.  Overtime Pay.  HQEs do not qualify for overtime compensation for work in excess of the maximum allowed 80-hour per pay-period.  Federal employees whose biweekly rate of pay  exceeds  the  maximum  rate  of  pay  for  a  grade  GS-15  or  EX-V  are  prohibited  from receiving  overtime  pay.    The  HQE  biweekly  rate  of  pay  usually  exceeds  this  threshold.  Further, an HQE will not be eligible for any other type of premium pay (e.g. danger pay). 10.8.5.  Travel  Time  and  Compensatory  Time.  Pay  while  in  travel  status  may  be authorized  depending  on  whether  the  HQE’s  work  schedule  is  full-time,  part-time,  or intermittent.  Pay is authorized for full-time and part-time HQEs when travel occurs during a regularly  scheduled  work  week  or  while  performing  work  while  traveling  to  or  from business.  Travel pay is authorized for intermittent HQEs only when performing work, since there  is  no  regularly  scheduled  work  week.    Pay  may  be  authorized  during  travel  in  rare instances  when  carried  out  under  arduous  conditions  or  is  not  scheduled/controlled  by  the Agency.  HQEs are not eligible for compensatory time. 10.9.  Performance  Management.  HQEs  are  subject  to  a  performance  management  process that requires the development of performance plans as a method to determine performance-based compensation.    HQEs  are  not  subject  to  the  requirements  set  forth  under  Chapter  6 “Performance Management” in this AFI. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   49  10.9.1.  Performance  Plan.  HQEs  are  required to  be  on  an  appointment-specific performance plan that spans the duration of the HQE’s appointment period in the Air Force.  The  “HQE  appointment-specific  performance  plan”  template  is  provided  by  AFSEMO  and will be used  for  all HQE performance plans.   All HQEs must be on approved performance plans  within  30  days  of  appointment  or  within  30  days  from  the  start  of  the  performance appraisal period. 10.9.1.1.

Performance  Requirements.  Three  mandatory  performance  requirements  are required for the Mission Accomplishment performance factor.  All performance requirements must  be  written  at  the  “In  Good  Standing”  level.    They  must  be  results-focused  and  be written in the SMART-Q format.  Each performance requirement must show alignment to a specific  goal  in  either  the  Department  of  the  Air  Force’s  strategic  plan,  the  MAJCOM specific strategic plan or DoD Organizational Assessment. 10.9.4.  Performance Rating Level.  The HQE performance management process is a pass-fail system.  There is only one performance rating level:  “In Good Standing”.  To receive a performance  rating  of  “In  Good  Standing”,  results  and  accomplishments  achieved  by  the HQE during the performance appraisal period must be characterized as: 10.9.4.1.  Uncommon, Proficient, Exceptional, Outstanding and; 10.9.4.2.  Demonstrate efficiencies and cost savings. 10.9.4.3.  HQEs serve at the will of the appointing official.  If an HQE does not achieve results expected at the “In Good Standing” level, the HQE must be terminated. 10.9.5.  Performance  Appraisal  Period.  While  each  performance  plan  is  appointment-specific, the performance appraisal period is typically from 1 October thru 30 September.  If an HQE begins  employment with  the Air  Force in  the middle of the performance appraisal period, the performance appraisal period will begin on the date of his/her appointment. 10.9.5.1.  HQEs must be on a performance plan for a minimum of 90 days in order to be eligible  to  receive  a  performance  rating.    Otherwise,  the  performance  appraisal  period will  be  extended  for  a  maximum  of  15  months  to  coincide  with  the  end  of  the  next performance cycle. 10.9.5.2.  Rating  officials  are  responsible  for  assessing  and  monitoring  performance during  the  performance  appraisal  period  and  ensuring  on-going  feedback  as  necessary.  On-going  feedback  should  address  expectations  and  progress  on the  HQE’s accomplishments  towards  meeting  the  performance  requirements  set  forth  in  the   50  AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012 performance plan.  A mandatory mid-year performance review must be held and the date formally documented on the performance plan. 10.9.5.3.  Rating  officials  are  responsible  for  providing  a  recommended  performance rating for the HQE at  the end of the performance appraisal period.   If warranted, rating officials may recommend consideration of a performance-based bonus in accordance with the compensation section below. 10.9.5.4.  The  PRB  review  the  performance  appraisals  of  all  HQEs  eligible  for  a performance  rating.    The  PRB  assesses  the  recommended  performance  rating  level  and determines if the accomplishments warrant a performance-based bonus.  There is no HLR process and HQEs cannot grieve their rating or performance-based pay increase/bonus. 10.9.5.5.  At the beginning of the appointment and at the conclusion of the performance cycle, all HQE performance plans must be provided to AFSEMO.  AFSEMO retains final HQE  performance  plans  for  a  minimum  of  three  years  after  expiration  of  the appointment. 10.9.6.  Performance-Based  Compensation.  HQEs must be on board at the end of the FY in  order  to  be  eligible  to  receive  a  performance-based  bonus.    In  order  to  be  eligible  to receive a performance-based pay increase, HQEs must still be on board during the first pay period in the following year. 10.9.6.1.  If  an  HQE  is  rated  at  the  “In  Good  Standing”  performance  level,  they  will receive a performance-based pay increase equal to the PAEP as determined by OPM. 10.9.6.2.  In  rare  circumstances,  accomplishments  achieved  by  an  HQE  during  the performance  appraisal  period  may  be  considered  “Extraordinary  Results”.    The “Extraordinary Results” are a high bar standard and are characterized as: 10.9.6.2.1.  Significantly  advancing  the  Air  Force  or  DoD’s  mission  or  program objectives (e.g., game changing); and 10.9.6.2.2.  Demonstrates significant efficiencies and/or cost savings. 10.9.6.2.3.  If  it  is  determined  an  HQE  achieved  “Extraordinary  Results”  during  the performance  appraisal  period,  they  will  receive  a  performance-based  pay  increase equal  to  the  PAEP  percentage  as  determined  by  OPM.    They  are  also  eligible  for  a performance-based bonus as determined by the PRB.  The bonus must be in the form of a retention bonus. 10.9.6.3.  Additional  payments,  to  include  a  performance-based  bonus  and/or  a recruitment, relocation or retention incentive, are subject to the following limitations: 10.9.6.3.1.  The  total  of  all  additional  payments  made  under  these  provisions  during any  12-month  period  may  not  exceed  the  lesser  of  (1)  $50,125,  which  may  be adjusted annually thereafter by the SECDEF; or (2) the amount equal to 50 percent of the employee’s annual rate of basic pay. 10.9.6.3.2.  These additional payments may be paid to an HQE who works a full-time, part-time, or intermittent work schedule. AFI36-901  23 JANUARY 2012   51  10.9.6.4.  Funds  to  cover  pay  increases  and/or  additional  payments  are  not  centrally funded  by  the  Air  Force.    Each  MAJCOM  is  required  to  provide  funds  to  cover  the additional increases/payments. 10.10.  Work  Schedule.  Employment  may  be  full-time,  part-time  or  intermittent.    The  work schedule  is  set  and  pre-approved  by  the  supervisor,  depending  on  organizational  mission,  with the flexibility to change on a daily basis. 10.11.
