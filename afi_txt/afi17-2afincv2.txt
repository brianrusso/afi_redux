This  instruction  provides  cyberspace  operations  examiners  and  cybercrew members with procedures and evaluation criteria used during performance evaluations on the Air Force Intranet Control weapon system. Adherence to these procedures and criteria will ensure an accurate  assessment  of  the  proficiency  and  capabilities  of  cyber  crewmembers.  In  addition  to general  criteria  information  and  grading  criteria,  this  AFI  provides  specific  information  and grading criteria for each crew position, special mission qualification (SMQ), instructor upgrade qualification, and Stan/Eval examiner objectivity evaluations. 1.2.  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication  .  Recommendations  for  changes  to  this volume  will  be  submitted  on  AF  Form  847,  through  the  appropriate  functional’s  chain  of command to HQ USAF/A3CX/A6CX. 1.3.  Waivers  .  Unless  another  approval  authority  is  cited  ("T-0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3"),  waiver authority for this volume is the MAJCOM/A3 (or equivalent).  Submit requests for waivers using AF  Form  679,  Air  Force  Publication  Compliance  Item  Waiver  Request/Approval  through  the chain  of  command  to  the  appropriate  Tier  waiver  approval  authority.  If  approved,  waivers remain  in  effect  for  the  life  of  the  published  guidance,  unless  the  waiver  authority  specifies  a shorter period of time, cancels in writing, or issues a change that alters the basis for the waiver. 1.4.  Procedures: 1.4.1.  Standardization  and  Evaluation  Examiners  (SEEs)  will  use  the  grading  policies contained  in  AFI  17-202V2  and  the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  instruction  volume  for conducting all AFSPC and AFSPC-oversight units’ weapon system performance, Cybercrew Training  Device  (CTD),  and  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  All  evaluations assume a stable platform and normal operating conditions. Compound emergency procedures (a scenario involving multiple emergency procedures) will not be used.  (T-2) 1.4.2.  Each squadron will design and maintain evaluation profiles for each mission/weapon system  that  includes  information  on  each  crew  position.  These  profiles,  approved  by Operations  Group  Standardization/Evaluation  (OGV),  should  outline  the  minimum  number and  type  of  events  to  be  performed/observed  to  satisfy  a  complete  evaluation.  Evaluation profiles  will  incorporate  requirements  established  in  the  applicable  grading  criteria  and reflect the primary unit tasking.  (T-3) 1.4.3.  All evaluations fall under the Qualification (QUAL), Mission (MSN) or Spot (SPOT) categories in AFI 17-202V2. For dual/multiple qualification or difference evaluations that do not update an eligibility period, list as "SPOT" on the front of the AF Form 4418, Certificate of  Cybercrew  Qualification,  and  explain  that  it  was  a  difference  evaluation  under  "Mission Description."  (T-2) 1.4.3.1.  Schedule  all  evaluation  activity  on  one  mission/sortie  to  the  greatest  extent possible.  All performance phase requirements should be accomplished during a training (or  operational  if  training  not  available)  mission/sortie.    If  a  required  event  is  not accomplished  during  a  mission/sortie,  Operations  Group  Commander  (OG/CC)  is  the waiver  authority  for  the  event  to  be  completed  in  the  CTD.  This  may  be  delegated  no AFI17-2AFINCV2  23 MAY 2017 5 lower  than  SQ/CC  unless  otherwise  authorized  in  position  specific  chapters  of  this instruction volume.  (T-3) 1.4.3.2.  During  all  evaluations,  any  grading  areas  observed  by  the  evaluator  may  be evaluated. If additional training is required for areas outside of the scheduled evaluation, document the training required under the appropriate area on the AF Form 4418. 1.4.3.3.  This  AFI  contains a table of requirements  for the  written requisites and a table for  the  grading  criteria  for  various  evaluations.  Each  table  may  include  a  "Note"  which refers to  a  general  note  found in  the individual  grading  criteria,  and/or  a  number which refers  to  a  note  shown  below  the  table.  To  complete  an  evaluation,  all  areas  annotated with an "R" must be successfully completed.  (T-3) 1.4.3.4.  Unit  examiners  may  give  evaluations  outside  of  their  organization  to  include administering  evaluations  between  Air  Force  Space  Command  (AFSPC),  AFRC  and ANG provided written agreements/understandings between the affected organizations are in-place.    Written  agreements/understandings  shall  be  reviewed  and  updated  annually. (T-3) 1.4.3.5.  Units may develop and administer supplemental evaluation criteria in addition to the required evaluation criteria in this instruction.  Supplemental evaluation criteria does not  supersede  the  evaluation  criteria  in  this  instruction  and  will  not  be  administered  to make the evaluation criteria of this instruction less restrictive.  Supplemental evaluation criteria will be published in local supplemental guidance. 1.4.4.  Momentary deviations from tolerances will not be considered in the grading, provided the examinee applies prompt corrective  action and such deviations  do not  jeopardize safety or the mission. Cumulative deviations will be considered when determining the overall grade. The SEE will state the examinee’s overall rating, review with the examinee the area grades assigned,  thoroughly  critique  specific  deviations,  and  recommend/assign  any  required additional training. (T-2) 1.4.5.  Evaluators may be used to instruct any phase of training they are qualified to teach to capitalize  on  their  expertise  and  experience.  If  an  evaluator  is  an  individual’s  primary  or recommending instructor, the same evaluator shall not administer the associated evaluation. (T-3) 1.4.6.  All  crewmembers  for  the  mission/sortie  (to  include  students,  instructors,  examinees, and  evaluators)  will  participate  in  and  adhere  to  all  required  mission  planning,  mission briefing, mission execution, and mission debriefing requirements.  All crewmembers must be current on the Crew Information File (CIF) and meet all Go/No-Go requirements IAW AFI 17-202 series publications, this instruction, and all applicable supplemental guidance prior to operating, instructing, or evaluating on the weapon system.  (T-2) 1.5.  General Evaluation Requirements: 1.5.1.  Publications  Check.  In  units  where  crewmembers  are  individually  issued  operating manuals,  crew  aids,  crew  aids,  etc.,  for  use  in  conducting  operations,  a  publications  check will  be  accomplished  for  all  evaluations.    The  publications  check  will  be  annotated  in  the Comments  block  of  the  AF  4418  only  if  unsatisfactory.  The  List  of  Effective  pages  (LEP) and annual “A” page checks in individually issued operating manuals must be accomplished, 6 AFI17-2AFINCV2  23 MAY 2017 documented,  and  current.  Unit  Stan/Eval  will  list  the  required  operating  publications  each cybercrew member is responsible for in the local CIF Library and/or local supplement to AFI 17-202V2.    NOTE:    In  units  where  such  resources  are  not  individually  issued  but  made available/accessible  for  common  use,  the  squadron  Stan/Eval  office  will  list  those  items (version  and  date)  and  ensure  the  accuracy  and  currency  of  the  information  contained  in those resources for common use.  (T- 2) 1.5.2.  Written Examinations: 1.5.2.1.  The requisites in Table 1.1 are common to all AFINC crew positions and will be accomplished  IAW  AFI  17-202V2,  all  applicable  supplemental  guidance,  and  unit directives.  These  will  be  accomplished  prior  to  the  mission/sortie  performance  phase unless  in  conjunction  with  a  No-notice  (N/N)  QUAL.    NOTE:  An  N/N  evaluation conducted  in  the  examinee’s  eligibility  period  and  meeting  all  required  QUAL  profile requirements  affords  the  examinee  to  opt  for  the  N/N  evaluation  to  satisfy  a  periodic QUAL,  in  which  the  examinee  may  complete  written  and  EPE  requisites  after  the performance  phase.    However,  the  written  examination(s)  and  EPE  must  be  completed prior to the examinee’s expiration date.  (T-2) 1.5.3.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluations  (EPE).  Every  Qualification  evaluation  which updates  an  expiration  date  will  include  an  EPE.  Qualification  EPEs  will  evaluate  the crewmember’s  knowledge  and/or  performance  of  emergency  procedures,  to  include  use  of emergency  equipment.    Use  the  Emergency  Procedures/Equipment  grading  criteria  for  all emergency situations given. Use Systems Knowledge/Operations grading criteria to evaluate general  systems  operation.    An  EPE  will  be  accomplished  orally  and  will  be  conducted before,  during,  or  after  the  performance  phase  of  any  applicable  evaluation  conducting  a scenario-based  evaluation  using  question/answer  (Q&A)  techniques.    Units  will  determine scenarios  for  EPEs.  The  SEE  will  assign  an  overall  EPE  grade  (1  or  3).    The  evaluation criteria for EPEs is defined in Area 8.  Document the accomplishment and result of the EPE in the Written Phase block of Section II Qualification on the AF Form 4418.  (T-2)   AFI17-2AFINCV2  23 MAY 2017 7 Table 1.1.

The CLOSED BOOK exam consists of 25-50 questions derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. (T-2)  2.  The Emergency Procedure Examination (EPE) is required for all INIT QUAL and subsequent periodic QUAL evaluations covering duties in the member’s primary crew position.  (T-2)  3. The Special Mission Qualification (SMQ) upgrade CLOSED BOOK exam is a separate closed book exam consisting of 25-50 questions specific to the SMQ derived from applicable operations manuals and governing directives. For initial SMQ evaluations not combined with the member’s periodic QUAL (for the primary crew position), the SMQ exam is the only required exam. Subsequent (periodic) SMQ evaluations should be combined with the member’s periodic QUAL evaluation, therefore, requiring the written requisites to consist of the CLOSED BOOK and applicable SMQ exam(s). (T-2)  4. Units may opt to administer OPEN BOOK examinations to their crews to enhance operator knowledge.   1.5.4.  Qualification  (QUAL)  Evaluations.  These  evaluations  measure  a  crewmember’s ability  to  meet  grading  areas  listed  in  Table  1.2.  at  the  end  of  this  chapter  and  defined  in Chapter  2  of  this  instruction.    IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  lead  MAJCOM  guidance,  QUAL evaluations  may  be  combined  with  MSN  evaluations.  When  practical,  QUAL  evaluations should be combined with Instructor evaluations, as applicable for the crew position.  (T-2) 1.5.5.  Mission  (MSN)  Evaluations.  IAW  AFI  17-202V2  and  lead  MAJCOM  guidance,  the requirement  for  a  separate  MSN  evaluation  may  be  combined  with  the  QUAL  evaluation. The various procedures and techniques used throughout the different weapon system variants are  managed  through  a  training  program  which  results  in  a  mission  certification  or culminates  with  a  special  mission  qualification  (SMQ).  Mission  certifications  will  be  IAW AFI17-202V1,  AFI  17-2AFINCV1,  Air  Force  Intranet  Network  Control  (AFNIC)  Training and  all  applicable  supplements  and  will  be  documented  in  the  appropriate  training  folder.  8 AFI17-2AFINCV2  23 MAY 2017 MSN and SMQ evaluation grading areas are also listed in Table 1.2. at the end of this chapter and defined in Chapter 2 of this instruction.  (T-2) 1.5.5.1.  For cybercrew members who maintain multiple mission certifications, recurring evaluations  need  only  evaluate  the  primary  mission  events  as  long  as  currency  is maintained in all other required training events. (T-2) 1.5.6.  Instructor Evaluations.  Grading  areas for these evaluations  are listed in  Table 1.2.  at the  end  of  this  chapter.    See  Chapter  3  of  this  instruction  for  amplified  information  and grading area definitions.  (T-2) 1.5.7.  Stan/Eval  Examiner  (SEE)  Objectivity  Evaluations.    Grading  areas  for  these evaluations  are  listed  in  Table  1.2.  at  the  end  of  this  chapter.    See  Chapter  4  of  this instruction for amplified information and grading area definitions.  (T-2) 1.5.8.  No-Notice Evaluations. OG/CC will determine no-notice evaluation procedures/goals. (T-3) 1.6.  Grading  Instructions  .  Standards  and  performance  parameters  are  contained  in  AFI  17-202V2 and this instruction. Q, Q- and U ratings are used for specific evaluation areas.  Q1, Q2, and Q3 are used for the overall evaluation rating. While the three-level  grading system (Q, Q-, U) is used for most areas; a "Q-" grade will not be used for critical evaluation areas. 1.6.1.  Critical Area/Subarea. Critical areas are events that require adequate accomplishment by  the  examinee  to  successfully  and  safely  achieve  the  mission/sortie  objectives  and complete  the  evaluation.  These  events,  if  not  adequately  accomplished  could  result  in mission failure, endanger human life, or cause serious injury or death. Additionally, critical areas/subareas  apply  to  time-sensitive  tasks  or  tasks  that  must  be  accomplished  as expeditiously  as  possible  without  any  intervening  lower  priority  actions  that  would,  in  the normal  sequence  of  events,  adversely  affect  task  performance/outcome.  If  an  examinee receives a "U" grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be "Q-3." Critical areas are identified by "(C)" following the applicable area title. (T-2) 1.6.2.  Major  Area/Subarea.  Major  areas  are  events  or  tasks  deemed  integral  to  the performance of other tasks and required to sustain acceptable weapon system operations and mission execution. If an examinee receives a "U" grade in a non-critical area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical  area  or  areas  may  still  receive  a  "Q-1"  overall  grade  at  evaluator  discretion.  An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the flight examiner, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas.  Major areas are identified by "(M)" following the applicable area title. (T-2) 1.6.3.  Minor Area/Subarea. Minor areas are rudimentary or simple tasks related to weapons system  operations  that  by  themselves  have  little  or  no  impact  on  mission  execution.  Minor areas are identified by "(m)" following the applicable area title. 1.6.4.  If an examinee receives  a  "U"  grade in  a  non-critical  (major or minor) area then the overall grade awarded will be no higher than "Q-2." An examinee receiving a "Q-" grade in a non-critical area or areas may still receive a "Q-1" overall grade at evaluator discretion. An overall "Q-3" can be awarded if, in the judgment of the SEE, there is justification based on performance in one or several areas/sub areas. (T-2) AFI17-2AFINCV2  23 MAY 2017 9 1.6.5.  The SEE must  exercise judgment  when the wording of  areas  is  subjective and when specific situations are not covered. 1.6.6.  Evaluator  judgment  will  be  the  final  determining  factor  in  deciding  the  overall qualification level. Table 1.2.  Crew Position/SMQ Specific Requirements - Performance Phase Evaluations.

SEE  Objectivity  Evaluations  are  a  vehicle  for  commanders  to  upgrade crewmembers for SEE qualification and a tool to monitor the evaluator crew force’s adherence to Stan/Eval  directives.  Grading  criteria  contained  herein  cannot  accommodate  every  situation.  Written  parameters  must  be  tempered  with  sortie  objectives,  evaluator  judgment,  and  task accomplishment in the determination of overall examinee performance. The criteria contained in this chapter  are established by experience, policies, and procedures set  forth in  weapon system manuals  and  other  directives.  The  criteria  contained  in  this  chapter  are  applicable  to  all  SEE Objectivity Evaluations for AFINC crewmembers. (T-2) 4.2.  Evaluator Upgrade and Qualification Requisites  .  Evaluator upgrade candidates will be selected from the most qualified and competent instructors. (T-2) 4.2.1.
