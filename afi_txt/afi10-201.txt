DEPARTMENT OF THE AIR FORCE HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES AIR FORCE WASHINGTON, DC     MEMORANDUM FOR DISTRIBUTION C                                         MAJCOMs/FOAs/DRUs  FROM:  HQ AF/A3   1630 Air Force Pentagon   Washington DC 20330-1630 AFI 10-201_AFGM2016-01 30 November 2016  SUBJECT: Air Force Guidance Memorandum to AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting           By Order of the Secretary of the Air Force, this Guidance Memorandum immediately  implements changes to AFI 10-201, Force Readiness Reporting, 3 March 2016.  Compliance with this memorandum is mandatory.  To the extent its directions are inconsistent with other Air Force publications, the information herein prevails, in accordance with AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.   The attachment to this memorandum provides clarifying guidance regarding the reassignment of the Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS), E-SORTS and document monitor responsibilities, within Air Force units.  This memorandum becomes void after one-year has elapsed from the date of this memorandum, or upon publication of an Interim Change or rewrite of the affected publication whichever is earlier.    MARK C. NOWLAND, Lieutenant General, USAF  Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations,  Plans and Requirements   Attachment: Guidance Changes    ATTACHMENT Guidance Changes  2.11.2. Designate up to six but no less than two UA roles for their respective unit (T-1). Ensure UAs complete AFRR training to perform readiness reporting duties and have active DRRS user accounts to ensure continuous coverage while others are on leave, TDY, or deployed (T-1). The UA role will reside within the Commander’s Support Staff (CSS); this does not preclude commanders from assigning additional UAs outside of the CSS as required (T-3).  Units that do not earn a CSS will have their UAs assigned at their servicing CSS (group or wing level) (T-3).  Commanders are empowered at all levels to consolidate CSS-assigned duties as appropriate.  UUs are optional, but greatly increase the accuracy of the report as they are the SMEs for the individual sections (T-2).  4.1.1.3. Total Personnel Available (TPAVL) is determined by calculating the number of TPASG available to the unit within the DOC Statement response time. See Paragraph 4.2. for specific availability guidance. Both TPAVL and Critical Personnel Available (CPAVL) are “editable" fields in AF-IT to allow CCs to make adjustments based on their determination if an individual is 'available' for duty. If a UA/UC disagrees with TPAUTH and TPASG, they will address the discrepancy with the applicable ADS POC. CCs should review personnel statuses to ensure accurate TPAVL are counted regardless of AFSC, skill level, or grade, and may exceed the TPAUTH number.  4.2. Determining Personnel Availability.  Personnel readiness is a combination of administrative and medical factors that determine if an individual is available to deploy in the event of OPLAN execution.  In general, in the event of OPLAN execution minor Deployment Availability (DAV) codes and minor medical readiness issues will be cleared-up prior to deployment.     Unit personnel may be considered available if they are assigned to the unit and meet the following requirements:  4.2.1. Can be utilized within the prescribed unit response time.    4.2.2. Not restricted from deploying or employing with the unit. Personnel with the following DAV codes or Duty Limiting Conditions (DLC) may be restricted from deploying; however, they may still be counted as available if used to support the in-place mission.  DAV Codes that result in unavailable are: 1) DAV 36: Prisoner 2) DAV 40: Deployment Limited to Installations with MTF 3) DAV 43: Deployment Limited to CONUS installations with MTF 4) DAV 48: Medically Disqualified 5) DAV 49: Pregnancy Deferment 6) DAV 56: Airman with less than 12 weeks TAFMS 7) DAV 60: Deferred from Hostile Fire Zone 8) DAV 61: Sole Surviving Son or Daughter 9) DAV 66: Conscientious Objector 10) DAV 73: Age 60 (ARC) 11) DAV 74: Involuntary Discharge Pending 12) DAV 75: Selective Retention 13) DAV 76: Voluntary Discharge Request 14) DAV 79: Ex-prisoner of War 15) DAV 99: Voluntary Period of Limited Active Duty   In addition to the above listing, any DAV code that results in an “Availability Determination” of “Not available for deployment” (without additional caveats) or “Available except for deployments to Hostile Fire Zone” should be counted as unavailable.  All other DAV codes should be considered available, to include members on leave, provided they can be recalled within the unit response time.  Commanders may consider an Airman unavailable if that Airman cannot meet the unit response time regardless of DAV code (for example, pending courts martial, civil trial or other extenuating circumstances not codified in the Airman’s personnel record).   The full listing of DAV codes can be found via AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning And Execution.    4.2.4. Not deployed.  Deployed personnel are personnel awarded a duty status code of “20” with a TDY type code of “1” in MILPDS which is triggered by Contingency, Exercise, Deployment (CED) orders.  4.2.3.1. Commanders will use IMR when determining personnel availability (T-1). Personnel having a duty limiting code restricting them from deployment (IAW AFI 10-203, Duty Limiting Conditions) may be considered available for in-garrison mission tasks, as determined by the commander.  Personnel with an IMR status of Not Medically Ready (NMR), Medically Ready Indeterminate (MRI) and Unknown will be considered unavailable.  Personnel with an IMR Status of Fully Medically Ready (FMR), and Partially Medically Ready (PMR) will be considered available.    5.1. Equipment and Supplies On-hand Reporting. Equipment and supplies on-hand measurement is used to indicate the equipment and supplies the unit possesses, on-hand, to support its full spectrum mission(s), as designed and organized. Consider deployed equipment unavailable.  Equipment and supplies on-hand reporting is based on a unit’s authorizations, through an AF approved ADS (e.g., AFEMS, ACES and ILS-S) listing all authorized and funded equipment and supplies. If a piece of equipment is not autopopulated in AF-IT, units will work with Wing Readiness POCs to notify MAJCOM Readiness Offices to ensure it is captured in the AF Tables or to create a manual packet if auto-population is not possible (T-1).  ADDED 5.2.1.5. Deployed items.  6.2.1. For AFSCs that utilize AFTR or TBA, AF-IT identifies the specified AFSC skill level, then takes the total qualification tasks completed and divides by the total qualification tasks enrolled. This provides an aggregated “percent qualified” for the specific AFSC skill level.  Airman enrolled in upgrade training will be considered 100% trained in their previous skill level.  E.g. A 3-level in upgrade training to 5-level will be considered as a fully trained 3-level.       BY ORDER OF THE SECRETARY  OF THE AIR FORCE AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION 10-201 3 MARCH 2016 Operations FORCE READINESS REPORTING  COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:   Publications and forms are available on the e-Publishing website at www.e-Publishing.af.mil for downloading or ordering RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication    OPR:  AF/A3OR  Supersedes:  AFI 10-201, 19 April 2013;                          AFI 10-252, 9 August 2012  Certified by: AF/A33  (Maj Gen James N.

Readiness  reporting.  Air  Force  readiness  reporting  is  comprised  of  three  distinct,  but closely  aligned  assessments:  Resource  Readiness,  Capability  Readiness,  and  Unit  Type  Code (UTC) Readiness.  Resource readiness (formerly the Status of Resources and Training System or SORTS) is a commander’s objective assessment of the unit’s ability to execute the full spectrum mission for which the unit was organized.  In addition, it measures the effectiveness in meeting Title  10,  United  States  Code  (USC)  responsibilities  to  organize,  train,  and  equip  forces  for combatant commands.  Capability readiness (formerly the Defense Readiness Reporting System or  DRRS)  is  a  commander’s  subjective  assessment  of  the  unit’s  ability  to  accomplish  tasks based on the mission for which the unit was organized or designed.  In addition, it provides an assessment  of  the  unit’s  ability  to  perform  assigned  missions  (i.e.,  Named  Operations  and  Top Priority  Plans).    Resource  and  Capability  readiness  are  reported  via  DRRS.    UTC  readiness  is contained in the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Reporting Tool (ART).  ART is the Air Force system  used  to  employ  the  force  to  fulfill  global  requirements  across  the  range  of  military operations  which  can  be  executed  from  individual  to  multiple  units.    Refer  to  AFI  10-244, Reporting Status of Air and Space Expeditionary Forces, and AFI 10-401, Air Force Operations Planning and Execution, for further information on ART. 1.1.1.  Resource  readiness  is  the  ability  of  a  unit  to  provide  trained  personnel  and  required equipment for the entire range of missions the unit is organized for.  Capability readiness is the  ability  of  the  trained  personnel  coupled  with  the  equipment  to  accomplish  discrete mission  essential  tasks  (METs)  to  support  designed  and  assigned  missions.    Regarding Capability  readiness,  commanders  must  ensure  the  capability  can  be  accomplished  to  the appropriate  level  (i.e.,  capacity).    Capacity  is  inherent  in  all  tasks.    Commanders  need  to determine the maximum level of capacity required for each task then assess whether the unit can provide the capability to the required level of capacity. 1.1.2.  Readiness reporting will not be used as input for the performance appraisal of a unit or a unit commander.   Unit commanders, however,  are ultimately  responsible for all unit data and readiness assessments. 1.1.3.  All units with a United States Air Force (USAF) Personnel Accounting Symbol (PAS) alpha  numeric  code  are  automatically  registered  in  DRRS  using  their  PAS  code.    A  unit  is defined in accordance with (IAW) Chapter 2 of AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization. 1.1.4.  Measured  Units.    Units  with  a  Unit  Descriptor  Code  (UDC)  of  combat,  combat support, or combat service support within the PAS code table, and that fulfill the AFI 38-101, Air Force Organization, description of a unit are considered measured units.  Measured units report  readiness  assessments  in  DRRS  and  are  required  to  have  a  current  Designed Operational  Capability  (DOC)  Statement  in  DRRS,  on  the  DOC  Statement  tab  within  the Current Unit Status (CUS) page (T-1). 1.1.4.1.  Measured units are identified in DRRS with a Major Unit Indicator (MAJOR) of “Y”.  8 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 1.1.4.2.  In  addition  to  measured  units,  MAJCOMs  and  Numbered  Air  Forces  (NAFs) will  make  a  Capability  assessment  (T-0).    Wings  and  Groups  may  submit  a  Capability Readiness Assessment based on its subordinate unit’s capabilities.  Composite/aggregate unit reports must be received within 96 hours of the oldest individual unit’s assessment date (T-1). 1.1.4.3.  In  order  to  support  a  uniform  readiness  picture  of  medical  forces  across  the Department of Defense (DoD), Regular Air Force (RegAF) medical units typically report at the medical treatment facility (MTF) level. 1.1.5.  DRRS.  In accordance with Title 10 USC §117 requirements, the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF)  established  DRRS  as  the  sole  readiness  reporting  system  for  the  Department  of Defense.  As such, DRRS is used by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Combatant Commands (CCMDs), Services, and Combat Support  Agencies.  It  is  a single  automated reporting system  within the DoD functioning  as the  central  registry  of  all  operational  units  in  the  US  Armed  Forces  and  designated  foreign organizations.    It  provides  objective  data  critical  to  crisis  planning,  the  contingency  and peacetime  planning  processes,  while  also  establishing  a  subjective  capabilities-based, adaptive, near real-time readiness reporting system for the DoD to measure the readiness of military units to meet missions and goals assigned by the SECDEF.  It is used by the Chief of Staff  United  States  Air  Force  (CSAF)  and  subordinate  commanders  in  assessing  their effectiveness in meeting Title 10 USC responsibilities to organize, train, and equip forces for CCMDs.   In addition,  DRRS data is  used by other joint  automated systems.   Examples are the  Integrated  Development  Environment  (IDE)  /  Global  Transportation  Network  (GTN), Joint  Operation  Planning  and  Execution  System  (JOPES),  National  Military  Command Center  (NMCC)  Command  and  Control  System,  and  the  Nuclear  Planning  and  Execution System.   1.1.5.1.  The  USAF  uses  DRRS  information  in  assessing  readiness,  determining budgetary allocation and management actions impacts on unit level readiness, answering congressional  inquiries,  analyzing  readiness  trends,  and  supporting  readiness  decisions.  DRRS  also  provides  indications  of  efficacy  of  resource  allocation  decisions  and  the impacts of budgetary constraints on resourcing unit requirements. 1.1.6.  Frequency of Reporting.  Submit the Resource Readiness Assessment and Capability Readiness Assessment  via DRRS between the 1st  and 15th  of each month  (T-1).  AF units will report both Resource and Capability Readiness Assessments monthly  (T-0).  Units will continuously  monitor  changes  in  their  Category  Level  (C-Level),  overall  reason  code, measured area levels, measured area reason codes, Percent Effective (PCTEF) data, Get Well Dates  (GWD),  unit  location,  and  Mission  Essential  Tasks  (METs).    When  the  unit commander identifies a change, units will report these changes to any of the aforementioned areas within 24 hours of the event necessitating the change (T-0).  Units must verify that the report arrives in the DRRS database within 24 hours of submission (T-0).  See Chapter 3 for Resource Readiness and Chapter 8 for Capability Readiness. 1.1.6.1.  If  unit  status  has  not  changed  since  the  last  report,  a  full  report  will  still  be submitted along with any remarks in the database to reflect an updated reporting date (T-0).  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 9 1.1.6.2.  A  unit  is  required  to  maintain  its  reporting  frequency  even  if  completely  or partially  deployed/employed,  temporary  duty  (TDY),  undergoing  service  directed resource actions, and exercises or inspections (T-0). 1.1.6.3.  The  Chairman,  in  coordination  with  the  Service  Chiefs  and  the  affected Combatant Commanders (CCDRs), as well as the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Deputy Chief of Staff Operations, may require units to report more frequently.  1.1.7.  In  the  event  of  conflict  between  this  AFI  and  MAJCOM  supplements  and/or Functional  Area  Manager  (FAM)  Guidance,  AFI  10-201  guidance  will  take  precedence.  Concerned  parties  will  contact  AF/A3OR  for  resolution.    OSD  and  CJCS  guidance  takes precedence over AFI 10-201. 1.2.  Resource Readiness.  Resource Readiness provides an objective assessment of unit status, based on the full mission set it was organized for (to include Named Operations and OPLANS).  Resource Readiness communicates readiness information, specifically a unit’s resources, through category-levels and four measured resource areas that are derived directly from authoritative data sources  (ADS).    Reference  CJCSM  3150.02B  for  all  mandatory  data  fields  and  formats.  Reference the Registration Table, in the AF Tables on the DRRS Homepage, under Documents, for  the  ADSs  populating  the  data  fields  and  the  applicable  coordination  office  for  resolving discrepancies. 1.2.1.  Resource readiness measurement criteria is  designed and developed by Headquarters Air  Force  (HAF)  FAMs,  with  MAJCOM/AFIMSC  FAM(s)  assistance  as  necessary,  to provide valid assessments regarding unit readiness.   1.2.2.  Commanders,  or  their  designated  alternates,  assess  measurements  against  their authorized,  possessed,  and  assigned  resources  to  determine  if  they  provide  a  realistic indication  of  the  unit’s  readiness.    It  is  critical  that  commanders  identify  the  measured resource  areas  rated  lower  than  Level  1  in  order  to  promote  and  justify  corrective  action (including funding, personnel, and equipment allocations).  To ensure reports are accurate to facilitate  appropriate  sourcing  and  employment,  commanders  must  not  mask  deficiencies.  Effective  management  of  unit  resources  requires  correct  information  at  all  levels.    A fundamental premise of Resource Readiness reporting is integrity. 1.2.3.  When deployed/employed in response to a crisis or operations order (OPORD), report the  unit’s  resource  readiness  to  support  the  mission(s)  via  the  PCTEF  field,  reference Paragraph 3.7. (T-0).  If reporting PCTEF, the unit will report on a corresponding Named Operation mission(s) in the Capability Readiness Assessment (T-0). 1.2.4.  Measurements are based on the unit's full mission set for which it is organized.  Units are required to measure and report on all resource readiness measurement criteria referenced in  the  AF  Tables  for  DRRS,  specifically  from  any  of  the  unit’s  authorizations  documents, such as the Unit Manning Document (UMD), Allowance Standard (AS), and authorizations from  AF-approved  ADSs.    Units  must  report  on  these  resources  even  if  not  yet  delivered (e.g., equipment for a newly activated unit).  In Resource Readiness Assessments, units must report solely on their own resources (T-0). 1.2.4.1.  Personnel  Measurement  Baseline.    The  baseline  for  measuring  personnel  is  the UMD  funded  authorizations.    Units  will  no  longer  use  UTCs  as  the  baseline  for measuring personnel.  Reduced readiness in the personnel measured area will signify at a  10 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 minimum  the  need  for  additional/critical  personnel.    If  the  UMD  does  not  accurately reflect the unit’s designed mission requirement, action must be taken to correct the source UMD.  See Chapter 4. 1.2.4.2.  Equipment  and  Supplies  On-hand  Measurement  Baseline.    The  baseline  for measuring equipment and supplies is the unit’s authorizations within the designated ADS for  any  resource.    Examples  of  equipment  ADSs  for  authorizations,  possession  and/or condition  include  Air  Force  Equipment  Management  System  (AFEMS),  Integrated Logistics  System-Supply  (ILS-S),  Medical  Readiness  Decision  Support  System (MRDSS),  Automated  Civil  Engineer  System  (ACES)  and  Logistics,  Installations, Mission Support System – Enterprise View (LIMS-EV).  Units will no longer use UTCs as the baseline for measuring resources in resource reporting.  MAJCOM A4s, respective FAMs, to include AFIMSC, and units must ensure all equipment requirements associated with  the  postured  UTCs  are  included  in  the  ADS  or  AS.    Reduced  readiness  in  this measured  area  will  signify  the  need  for  additional  equipment.    A  unit  possessing equipment  that  is  not  mission  ready  will  report  the  not-mission-ready  status  in  the equipment condition measured area (T-1).  If the AS or ADS does not accurately reflect the  unit’s  requirement,  action  must  be  taken  to  correct  the  source  AS  or  ADS.    See Chapter 5. 1.2.4.3.  Equipment  Condition  Measurement  Baseline.    The  Equipment  Condition  area measures the condition of possessed equipment and supplies.  Units assess the condition of possessed equipment by determining if it is mission ready or safe to use as originally designed.  Examples of ADSs for equipment authorizations, possession and/or condition will  be  derived  from  the  same  ADS  as  equipment  and  supplies  on-hand  measurement.  See Chapter 5. 1.2.4.4.  Training  Measurement  Baseline.    Training  is  based  on  the  number  of  assigned personnel to the unit.  Attached personnel are not to be counted in the training measured resource area (T-1).  Assigned personnel are measured using one of the following method types:    Qualification  Training,  Crew/Team  Training,  or  CAF  Training.    The  training methods are measured IAW operational Flying Operations AFI Volume (Vol) 1s, Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Tasking Messages, Special Mission Capability Codes (SMCC), and  training  databases  such  as  Air  Force  Training  Record  (AFTR),  Training  Business Area  (TBA),  ACES,  MRDSS,  and  Aviation  Resource  Management  System  (ARMS).  See Chapter 6. 1.3.  Capability  Readiness.  Capability  readiness  reflects  the  unit’s  ability  to  accomplish  the designed mission by assessing the METs, while also considering the unit’s ability to provide the level-of-capability  it  is  organized  for  (i.e.,  the  unit’s  available  resources).    While  Resource Readiness Assessments captures the unit’s resource deficiencies and ART reporting reflects the impact  of  the  resource  shortfalls  on  unit  deployment  capability  of  the  UTCs,  Capability Readiness  Assessments  “tie  it  all  together”  describing  “what  the  unit  is  ready  for.”    Standard measurement  criteria  are  necessary  to  provide  similarly  capable  units  globally.    Where  units present unique capabilities above the standard measurement criterion, MAJCOMs/AFIMSC may supplement the unit’s Core METL with additional METs and/or performance standards.  Where units  do  not  possess  the  full  capability  reflected  in  the  standard  measurement  criterion, MAJCOMs, in coordination and under advisement from AFIMSC (when applicable), may delete those  non-applicable  METs  and/or  performance  standards  from  the  unit’s  Core  METL.    Unit  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 11 commanders  or  their  designated  alternates  assess  measurements  against  the  unit’s  mission  to provide  a  realistic  indication  of  the  unit’s  readiness  with  the  intent  of  informing  higher headquarters.  Commanders must “tell it like it is” and not allow capability assessments to mask resources deficiencies (C-Levels).  Risk must be balanced with responsibility.   1.3.1.  Measured units will assess their designed (Core) capabilities readiness IAW their AF standardized unit/functional area Core METL provided in the Air Force Universal Task List (AFUTL)  (T-1).    The  Core  METLs  are  located  on  SIPR  at  the  Headquarters  Air  Force Readiness  website—contact  a  MAJCOM  Readiness  Office  for  access instructions.  MAJCOMs/AFIMSC /NAFs can select tasks from the AFUTL or Universal Joint Task List (UJTL)  for  their  Core  METL.    Measured  units  will  assess  readiness  against  Core  METL, Named  Operations  (if  applicable),  and  Top  Priority  Plans  (identified  by  Parent  MAJCOM) (T-0).    Unit  capability  assessments  begin  as  soon  as  possible  after  a  unit  activates  and continue  until  the  30  days  prior  to  inactivation  or  there  are  no  longer  personnel assigned/available to assess unit capability (T-0).  See Chapter 8. 1.3.1.1.  Units converting to a new mission will continue to report on their current METL until removal from C-5 status (see para  3.3.8.1) (T-2).  Reporting will begin on the new METL upon completion of transition (T-2).  1.4.  DOC  Statement.  The  purpose  and  function  of  the  DOC  Statement  and  the  way  it  was developed have changed significantly with the introduction of two pieces of software embedded within DRRS: AF-IT and DOC Tool.  The DOC Statement is now a convenient single document that  compiles  Core  METL,  War  and  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP),  UTC  Availability  (UTA),  and specific  resources  units  are  required  to  report.    The  DOC  Statement,  itself,  is  not  a  source  or authoritative document.  The DOC Statement does not establish, organize, design, equip, or task a  unit.    The  DOC  Statement  is  simply  a  MAJCOM-generated  document  that  consolidates reporting criteria and information based on ADS requirements and FAM inputs.  Its purpose is to ensure  standards  of  reporting  and  to  assist  the  units  and  commanders  with  gathering  and reporting readiness data.   1.4.1.  Measured units will have only one DOC Statement that will be located in DRRS with an  effective  date  no  more  than  two  years  old  (T-1).    Much  of  the  information  on  the  DOC Statement  is  received  directly  from  ADSs.    Although  automatically  populated  data  on  the DOC Statement comes from ADSs, additional staffing might be required for the MAJCOM Readiness  Point  of  Contact  (POC)  prior  to  publishing.    In  cases  where  the  ADS  supplies inaccurate data,  action  must be taken to  resolve the issue  with  the ADS.  Once the issue is resolved,  the  MAJCOM  Readiness  Office  will  publish  the  DOC.    Units  will  continue resources  assessments  during  ADS  resolution  efforts  and  the  issue  will  be  corrected  in  the next scheduled DOC Statement review (T-1).  AF/A3OR will mediate disagreements during the resolution efforts (T-1). 1.4.1.1.  Reference  the  DOC  Statement  Table,  in  AF  Tables  on  the  DRRS  Homepage, under  Documents,  for  the  ADSs  and  corresponding  offices  to  resolve  discrepancies.  Once resolved, a new DOC Statement will be published (T-1).  All added notes/remarks must include the authoritative source reference. 1.4.2.  No  two  DOC  Statements  will  reference  the  same  resources  (T-0).    Additional information on how to draft, edit, submit, and publish the DOC Statement can be found in the DOC Statement Users Guide on the DRRS Homepage, under Documents.   12 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 1.4.3.  Measuring Unit Resources using Unit Response Time.  Unit response time is defined as AF units ready (manned, equipped, and trained) for deployment and/or employment within a  specified  time.    AF  units  use  the  forecast  option,  IAW  CJCSM  3150.02  Series,  meaning units  report  on  whether  their  resources  can  be  mission  ready  and  available  within  their response time.  All reporting requirements referenced in the AF Tables for DRRS, located on the DRRS Homepage, must be reported regardless of whether the unit is currently provided the resources or tasked for the capability (T-1).  The ADS for AF unit response times is the Unit Response Time Table, developed by AF FAMs, in coordination with MAJCOM POCs and AF/A3OR, found on the DRRS homepage, under Documents.  Most unit response times are  standardized  for  like-type  units  within  a  MAJCOM.    This  response  time  must  not  be confused  with  UTC-type  response  times  specified  in  operation/contingency  plans  (this approach can result in assigning a unit multiple response times for multiple plans).  The DOC Statement  management  tool  in  DRRS  automatically  populates  the  standardized  response times. 1.4.3.1.  Measured  units  will  count  deployed  resources  as  available  if  they  can  be available within the unit response time (T-1).  Reference Paragraph  4.2 for information on counting available personnel. 1.4.3.1.1.  Response  times  for  units  may  be  changed  by  the  MAJCOM  FAM  when OPLANs/functional guidance require specific units meet a unique response time.  The MAJCOM FAM must coordinate the change with the MAJCOM Readiness Office in order  for  the  update  to  be  included  in  the  AF  Tables      (T-1).  This  variance  will  be included  in  the  DOC  Statement's  Amplifying  Notes  with  the  reference  directing  the variance (T-2). 1.5.  Total  Force  Integration  (TFI).  TFI  Associations  (TFIAs)  are  critical  to  Air  Force operations.   TFIAs  are  organizational  constructs  that  functionally  integrate  collocated organizations  from  the  RegAF  and  Air  Reserve  Component  (ARC).    Classic  Associations  are when a RegAF organization is host.  Active Associations are when an ARC organization is host.  Hybrid Associations are when one component host shares a mission with two or more associates from  the  other  components.    The  host  organization  is  the  organization  with  primary responsibility  for  mission  accomplishment  and  is  normally  assigned  the  preponderance  of  the primary  physical  resources  (e.g.,  aircraft,  weapon  systems  equipment,  weapon  system  support, and  production  facilities).    See  AFI  90-1001,  Responsibilities  for  Total  Force  Integration,  for more details. 1.5.1.  Each  unit  in  the  association  (host  and  associate)  will  independently  assess  their Resource readiness and Capability readiness (T-0).  The host and associate will each assess a Core METL (T-0).  Host organizations will link their METL to the readiness assessments of their respective associate organization(s) (T-1). 1.5.2.  The  host  and  associate(s)  will  each  have  their  own,  separate  DOC  Statement  (T-0).  However, certain elements will be the same on the host and associate DOC Statements.  Both the host and associate MAJCOMs (FAM and Readiness Office) will coordinate on TFI DOC Statements to ensure consistency and efficiency between the host and associate unit(s) (T-1).  DOC Statement entries common to the host and associate(s) are:  Unit UTC and Core METL (T-0).  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 13 1.5.2.1.  The  DOC  Statements,  in  the  amplifying  notes,  will  identify  the  relationship between  the  host  and  associate  unit  using  the  following  format:    Host:  Wing/Sq/Unit Identification  Code  (UIC)    Associate:  Wing/Sq/UIC  (T-2).    The  notes  will  include  the type  of  aircraft  flown  by  the  Host  and  Associate  unit  (T-1).    Additionally,  notes  will include the  crew complement and crew ratio  IAW AFI 65-503, US Air  Force Cost  and Planning Factors (T-1).  1.5.3.  The  parent  Wing  with  Administrative  Control  (ADCON)  of  the  associate  unit  will monitor  and  ensure  the  associate  unit  is  resourced  appropriately  to  fulfill  the  TFI  construct (T-2). 1.5.4.  The overall status  of TFIA organizations can be depicted by reviewing the Resource assessment  from  all  associated  organizations  and  confirming  this  assessment  through communication with the TFIA unit commander. 1.6.  Data Classification.  Resource and Capability readiness information is classified SECRET when filled in the report.  The association of the unit with its Operations Plan (OPLAN) tasking is normally classified at the level of classification of the OPLAN.  Classified material exceeding the  classification  of  the  DRRS  Database  (SECRET)  will  not  be  entered  into  DRRS  (T-0).  Individual pieces of readiness information are classified IAW Table 1.1 1.6.1.  Worksheets/briefing  materials  reflecting  measured  unit  data  will  be  given  the  same classification  level  as  the  material  from  which  it  was  derived.    Although  sources  used  to compile  a  unit’s  readiness  report  may  be  unclassified,  once  compiled  and  associated  with readiness ratings, it becomes classified at the highest level associated with the data (T-0).   1.6.2.  Composite  or  aggregate  data  will  be  classified  at  the  same  or  higher  level  as  the highest classified component of data (T-0).   1.6.3.  Derivative Classification.  Derivative classification is the incorporating, paraphrasing, restating,  or  generating,  in  a  new  form,  already  classified  information  and  marking  newly developed  material  consistent  with  the  classification  that  applies  to  the  source  information.  Individuals  applying  derivative  classification  markings  must  carry  forward  to  any  newly created  document  the  classification  markings  from  the  original  source  (Reference  AFI  31-401, Information Security Program Management). 1.6.4.  Classification  Authority.    The  OSD  DRRS  database  is  classified  SECRET//US ONLY.    Information  extracted  from  this  database  is  classified  by  CJCSI  3401.02B,  Force Readiness  Reporting,  CJCSM  3150.02B,  GSORTS,  or  by  the  United  States  Air  Force.  Information  extracted  from  the  database  must  contain  derivative  classification  markings consistent  with  DoDM  5200.01  v2,  DoD  Information  Security  Program:  Marking  of Classified  Information,  except  where  authorized  otherwise.    Derivative  classification  rules apply when extracts contain exempted data.  If no classification authority source exists, use CJCSM  3150.02  as  the  classification  authority.    Use  "Derived  From:  CJCSM  3150.02, GSORTS,  Declassify  On:  (date)”  to  mark  material  when  this  reference  is  used  as classification guidance.  The date of declassification is 10 years from the date of the original classification  decision,  unless  the  original  classification  authority  otherwise  determines  that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years  from  the  date  of  the  original  classification  decision.    The  reporting  headquarters  will determine  the  downgrading  of  classified  material  on  a  case-by-case  basis.    If  other  sources  14 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 direct  a  classification  higher  or  for  a  longer  period,  list  the  classification  guidance  as  the authority and list the specific sources on the file copy.  Unit and wing security managers and the  Chief  Information  Protection  Officer  (wing  or  MAJCOM-level)  should  be  consulted  in these  events.    At  a  minimum,  all  classified  documents  will  be  properly  marked  with  the overall  classification  on  the  top  and  bottom.    Notebooks,  binders,  folders,  etc.  containing classified  documents  will  be  conspicuously  marked  with  the  highest  classification  of  the material  contained.    Affix  the  appropriate  overall  classification  marking  or  classified  cover sheet  to  the  front  and  back  of  the  notebook,  binder,  folder,  etc.  (IAW  AFI  31-401, Information Security Program Management). 1.6.4.1.  All working papers must contain the highest overall classification, be destroyed when  no  longer  needed,  and  if  kept  more  than  180  days,  be  marked  as  a  finished document (T-0).  Working papers are documents and material accumulated or created in the preparation of finished documents and material IAW AFI 31-401. 1.6.5.  Downgrading Authority.  Downgrading of DRRS data and aggregate information will be  determined  by  the  reporting  headquarters  IAW  CJCSI  3401.02B.    The  authority  resides with Headquarters Air Force, AF/A3, Director of Operations.  AF/A3 will review classified readiness data  and  ascertain  whether the classification level  still applies  and will determine the downgrading of classified material on a case-by-case basis.    AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 15  Table 1.1.

CJCSI 5714.01D, Policy for the Release of  Joint  Information,  governs  the  release  of  readiness  information.    To  protect  against unauthorized  disclosure  of  sensitive  information,  requests  for  DRRS  access  from  non-DoD agencies will be forwarded to AF/A3OR for submission to the Joint Staff (JS) (T-1).  Authorized holders  of  AF  readiness  data  can  release  it  only  to  military  components  with  a  valid  need-to-know  and  appropriate  clearance.    Exceptions  to  this  policy  must  be  coordinated  through AF/A3OR.  16 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 1.7.1.  Specific  policies  for  auditors,  Congress,  and  the  general  public:    Auditors  and inspectors of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Office of the  Inspector General  of  the  Department  of  Defense  (OIG-DoD)  possess  legal  authority  under  Title  31 USC. §716, Availability of Information and Inspection of Records, and Public Law 95-452, Inspector General Act of 1978, codified at 5 USC App § 3, to access DRRS data for specified purposes.    Release  data  to  GAO  and  OIG-DoD  auditors  and  inspectors  in  accordance  with DoDI 7650.01, GAO and Comptroller General Access to Records and DoDI 7050.3, Access to Records and Information by the DoD IG.  Only the President and SECDEF can deny final access.  Refer denial proposals to AF/A3OR for submission to the JS. 1.7.1.1.

Category-levels  (C-Levels)  provide  clarity  of  resource  status  to  advise  the  SECDEF,  Combatant  Commanders (CCDRs), and the Services on current force readiness.  Category-levels are defined by the JS and derived  through  quantitative  criteria  to  define  in  qualitative  terms  the  degree  to  which  a measured unit is resourced to provide the level-of-capability for which it is organized.  C-Levels collectively represent, via a five point scale (see  Paragraph 3.3. for description/definition), the degree  to  which  a  unit  meets  resourced  based  standards  established  within  four  measured resource areas: Personnel (P), Equipment and Supplies On-Hand (S), Equipment Condition (R), and Training of assigned personnel (T). 3.2.  Air  Force  Specific  Requirements.  While  Joint  policy  requires  only  the  Overall  C-Level and  measured  area  P-/S-/R-/T-Levels,  the  Air  Force  requires  units  to  report  actual  raw  data percentages in each measured area.  This gives a crisis decision-maker and resource or training manager more detailed status than the C-Levels alone indicate.  For a complete list of Air Force specific  data  elements,  reference  CJCSM  3150.02B,  Global  Status  of  Resources  and  Training System (GSORTS). 3.3.  C-Levels  and  Associated  Remarks.  C-Levels  reflect  the  degree  to  which  unit  resources meet prescribed levels of P, S, R, and T. 3.3.1.  C-1.  The unit possesses the required manpower, resources and is trained to undertake the  full  mission(s)  for  which  it  is  organized  or  designed.    The  resource  and  training  area status  will  neither  limit  flexibility  and  methods  for  mission  accomplishment  nor  increase vulnerability of unit personnel and equipment.  The unit does not require any compensation for any deficiencies. 3.3.2.  C-2.  The unit possesses the required manpower, resources and is trained to undertake most of the mission(s) for which it is organized or designed.  The resource and training area status may cause isolated decreases in flexibility in methods for mission accomplishment, but will  not  increase  the  unit's  vulnerability  under  most  envisioned  operational  scenarios.    The unit would require little, if any, compensation for deficiencies. 3.3.3.  C-3.  The unit possesses the required manpower, resources and is trained to undertake many,  but  not  all,  portions  of  the  mission(s)  for  which  it  is  organized  or  designed.    The resource and training area status  will result in  significant  decrease in  flexibility for mission accomplishment  and  will  increase  vulnerability  of  the  unit  under  many,  but  not  all, envisioned  operational  scenarios.    The  unit  would  require  significant  compensation  for deficiencies. 3.3.4.  C-4.    The  unit  requires  additional  manpower,  resources  or  training  to  undertake  its mission(s), but it may be directed to undertake portions of its mission(s) with resources on-hand. 3.3.5.  C-5.  The unit is undergoing a Service-directed resource action and is not prepared, at this time, to undertake the mission set for which it is organized or designed. 3.3.6.  P-/S-/R-/T-6.  The unit is not required to measure in a specified area.  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 29 3.3.7.  Assigning the Overall C-Level.  Based on unit resource readiness, unit commanders or designated  alternates, assign the Overall C-Level each time it is reported  (T-0).   Normally, the  lowest  level  of  the  four  measured  resource  areas  is  reported  as  the  Overall  C-Level provided it is a realistic indication of the unit’s readiness (based on the C-Level definitions).  The  measured  area  data  cannot  be  arbitrarily  changed  from  calculated  values  (i.e.,  must  be reported  per  the  specified  formulas  and  tables).    If  the  lowest  measured  area  level  is  not  a realistic indication of the unit’s resource readiness, commanders may only lower the overall C-Level and must provide a complete and detailed explanation of why it is being lowered in the  REASN  remark  (T-1).    Commanders  will  not  assess  up  (T-1).    When  assigning  the overall  C-Level,  commanders  will  consider  assessing  downward  if  unable  to  meet  the requirements  of  their  quarterly,  semi-annual/annual  training  plan  (e.g.,  Ready  Aircrew Program  (RAP))  (T-1).    The  commander  should  consider  the  following  factors  when determining the overall unit C-Level: inspection results, assistance team results, and program readiness  reviews.    Units  receiving  a  Unit  Effectiveness  Inspection  (UEI)  overall  rating  of “INEFFECTIVE”  or rating  of “UNSATISFACTORY,” should lower their C-Level to a C-4 and provide remarks outlining deficiencies  and  resource  improvement  timetables.    The  remarks  should  reflect  training requirements  and/or  fix  actions,  as  deemed  necessary  from  the  inspection  report,  with expected completion dates.  The commander will provide rationale using the Overall Reason (REASN) remark label,  when the unit is less than C-1 (T-1).  The following factors should also be considered: a  Nuclear  Surety Inspection (NSI)  overall 3.3.7.1.  Personnel subjective factors include (but are not limited to): 3.3.7.1.1.  Availability of personnel who do not have the required critical AFSC. 3.3.7.1.2.  Personnel turnover rates that impact mission accomplishment. 3.3.7.1.3.  Unusually high number of personnel with Deployment Availability (DAV) codes,  Deployment  Limiting  codes  (DLCs)  or  otherwise  not  available  for deployment,  aiding  in  unit  deployment  or  in-garrison  mission  within  the  response time. 3.3.7.2.  Equipment and Supplies On-hand subjective factors include (but are not limited to): 3.3.7.2.1.  Item shortages having a larger effect than indicated by equipment fill rate. 3.3.7.2.2.  Status  of  plans  to  move  resources  from  temporary  peacetime  locations  to wartime locations. 3.3.7.2.3.  Differences between standard fill rates and various assessment tools. 3.3.7.2.4.  Individual protective equipment items availability; e.g., mobility bags. 3.3.7.3.  Equipment Condition subjective factors include (but are not limited to): 3.3.7.3.1.  Depot programmed and unscheduled maintenance status probability. 3.3.7.3.2.  Status of modification programs and their impact on daily operations. 3.3.7.3.3.  Mission Ready rates. 3.3.7.4.  Training subjective factors include (but are not limited to):  30 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 3.3.7.4.1.  Unavailability  of  qualified  training  personnel  (rated  and  non-rated),  of equipment and/or facilities, and of areas, ranges, or flying hours. 3.3.7.4.2.  Major training event time lapses or a high turnover of key personnel. 3.3.7.4.3.  Lack of sufficient number of assigned personnel with the AFSC skill levels authorized by the UMD (e.g., unit has cross-trainees assigned that are 3-levels but the UMD  authorizes  5-levels).    Lacking  AFSC  skill  levels  is  an  indication  of  training shortfalls,  not  personnel  availability.    Do  not  report  skill-level  shortages  as  non-available  personnel.    If  the  unit  has  the  correct  AFSC  assigned  but  needs  to  get personnel  trained  as  required  by  the  skill-level  authorized  (UMD),  the  lack  of required  skill-levels  may  not  be  reflected  in  the  training  sub-area  with  the  same weighted-negative impact it will cause to unit capability.  As a result, the commander should assess the Overall C-Level downward. 3.3.7.4.4.  Lack of training funds projected for current fiscal year. 3.3.7.5.  Other subjective factors for assessing down include (but are not limited to): 3.3.7.5.1.  The  unit’s  inability  to  operate  in  a  chemical,  biological,  radiological  and nuclear environment, see Chapter 7. 3.3.7.5.2.  Ability of contractors to provide contingency or wartime services. 3.3.7.5.3.  Ability of unit assigned foreign nationals to perform assigned tasks during contingencies or wartime. 3.3.8.  Assigning C-5 as the Overall C-Level.  A parent MAJCOM may authorize use of C-5 for  units  undergoing  a  Service-directed  resource  action  and  not  prepared  to  undertake  any portion  of  the  mission  set  for  which  they  are  organized  or  designed.    Units  authorized  to report  C-5  will  continue  to  compute  and  report  measured  area  P-,  S-,  R-,  T-Levels  at  least monthly unless directed to do so more frequently by the parent MAJCOM (T-0).  C-5 status will not exceed 18 months for RegAF units or 36 months for ARC units (T-1).  C-5 cannot be reported in any measured resource area.  C-5 is only used when authorized by the parent MAJCOM and one of the following conditions exists: 3.3.8.1.  Unit  Transition.    Unit  transitions  include  modernization/conversion  of  major equipment (e.g., F-15s to F-22s), modernization/upgrade of software in major equipment (i.e.,  extensive  equipment  testing/personnel  user  training),  a  change  in  a  unit’s  mission (which  can  be  accomplished  without  changing  the  major  equipment  involved),  and/or  a change in a unit’s home station location (higher headquarters approval may be required).  When  a  unit  is  undergoing  transition,  C-5  may  be  authorized  when  the  first  measured area  level  would  require  an  overall  C-4.    Note:  If  reporting  C-5,  units  will  continue  to report current measured area P-, S-, R-, T-Levels (T-0).  Units undergoing transition will report  C-5  as  the  Overall  C-Level  until  the  new  DOC  Statement  is  approved  and  all measured areas (except areas authorized to report S-/R-/T-6) have improved to C-3, and considering  timelines  in  Paragraph  3.3.8.    The  FAM  must  notify  the  MAJCOM Readiness Office when a unit begins and completes a transition or major conversion. 3.3.8.2.  Unit  Activation or  Re-activation.    Activating  units  may  be  authorized  to  report C-5  as  their  Overall  C-Level  until  all  measured  areas  have  reached  a  maintainable  C-3 (except  measured  areas  authorized  to  be  reported  as  S-/R-/T-6)  or  the  end  of  the  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 31 designated activation period,  whichever occurs first.  The unit’s MAJOR data field  will be changed to “Y” (T-0). 3.3.8.3.  Unit Inactivation.  Units may be authorized to report C-5 after the first measured area  requires  an  overall  C-4  and  must  continue  to  report  resource  readiness  until  unit inactivation is authorized by the publication of a command order (G-Series) and the DOC Statement  is  rescinded,  normally  30  days  prior  to  inactivation  (T-0).    Unit  will  be archived in the database when G-series orders are cut and the PAS is updated (T-1).  The unit’s MAJOR data field will be changed to “N” (T-0). 3.4.  General Policy for C-Level Calculations. 3.4.1.  The following policy guidelines apply to all measured units required to report: 3.4.1.1.  Two units will not count the same resource(s) as available (T-1). 3.4.1.2.  A  unit’s  Overall  C-Level  will  be  based  solely  on  the  resources  and  training organic to it (T-0). 3.4.1.3.  Units calculate and report area levels for all four measured resource areas (P, S, R, and T) unless exempted  for specific areas (T-0).  Use only published objective criteria for measurement (T-0).  Do not subjectively raise or lower measured resource area levels (T-0). 3.4.1.4.  Only  measured  unit  commanders,  or  their  designated  alternates,  can  assign  the unit’s Overall C-Level (T-0).  Commanders report the lowest of the four measured levels as  the  Overall  C-Level,  unless  factors  like  those  listed  in  Paragraph  3.3.7.  warrant  a downward change (T-0). 3.4.1.5.  Units reporting less than Level 1 in any area must clearly indicate the reason(s) (T-0).  Refer to Paragraph 3.9, for specific remark content requirements. 3.5.  Forecasting Overall C-Level Changes.  Use these data elements whenever the Overall C-Level  is  not  a  “1”;  an  assessed  downward  Overall  C-Level  (C-2/3/4X);  a  C-Level  change  is predicted; or when the Forecast Date of Change (CADAT) expires. 3.5.1.  When a unit forecasts a change in its C-Level, the unit must report the forecasted level in the Forecast Change Rating (CARAT) field  (T-0).  Units must also report the forecasted date of change in the CADAT field (T-0).  When a unit reports degraded C-Levels and it is unable to forecast a change date, the responsible MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM must provide the unit  assistance  to  determine  a  best  estimate  forecast  for  insertion  into  the  resource assessment.    For  units  reporting  C-1  that  expect  no  change,  the  CARAT  and  CADAT  data fields  may  be  left  blank.    The  CARAT  and  CADAT  remark  fields  must  be  updated  every time a resource assessment is submitted (T-0). 3.5.1.1.  The  3/6/12  month  forecast  remark  (labeled  as  CADAT  in  AF-IT)  is  required regardless of the current C-Level (T-1).  The remark will include the forecasted C-Level and a brief explanation at the 3, 6, and 12-month intervals (see Figure 3.1) (T-1).    32 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 Figure 3.1.  Forecast Remark. 3-MONTH FORECAST/C-4 DUE TO SCHEDULED EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE 6-MONTH FORECAST/C-1 12-MONTH FORECAST/C-2 DUE TO OUTBOUND PERSONNEL 3.5.2.  When  the  forecasted  C-Level  change  is  due  to  the  forecasted  inability  to  meet quarterly/semi-annual/annual  training  plan  requirements  (e.g.,  RAP),  units  will  preface forecast remarks with “TRNG PLAN RQMT” and include the issues, impacts and fix actions in the forecast remarks IAW Paragraph 3.9. (T-1). 3.6.  Limiting  Factor(s)  (LIMFACs).  A  LIMFAC  is  a  problem,  deficiency,  or  condition  that decreases  or  prevents  a  unit  from  accomplishing  its  full-spectrum  mission(s)  for  which  it  is organized  or  designed,  and  which  usually  requires  assistance  from  higher  headquarters  to resolve.    Within  the  scope  of  resource  reporting,  remarks  must  be  created  to  address  any LIMFAC.  Overall LIMFAC remarks will be reported under the Current Overall Category Level (READY) label  (T-0).   More detailed  LIMFAC remarks may be reported in  the four measured resource areas.  Examples of LIMFACs include critical AFSC or equipment shortages, problems with aircrew training, personnel experience levels, Mobility Readiness Spares Package (MRSP) and In-place Readiness Spares Package (IRSP) packing item shortages, etc. 3.7.  Use of the PCTEF Field.  PCTEF provides a subjective assessment of the unit’s ability to execute  its  currently  assigned  mission(s),  also  known  as  its  “A-Level”,  where  “A”  means “assigned.”    Assigned  missions  include  a  Named  Operation,  AEF  deployment,  OPLAN execution, etc.  PCTEF reporting is required for units preparing to deploy or currently deployed and will be reported for full or partial unit deployments (T-0).  However, units will only report PCTEF if 5% or more of the unit is deploying or deployed (assigned personnel and/or on-hand equipment)  (T-1).    PCTEF  reporting  is  required  no  later  than  120  calendar  days  prior  to  the deployment or upon receipt of an appropriate order (T-0).  Generally, a unit commander receives assigned  missions  through  a  higher  headquarters  order  or  directive  (e.g.,  Execute  Order (EXORD),  Prepare  to  Deploy  Order  (PTDO),  Deployment  Order  (DEPORD),  or  notification from  Installation  Deployment  Officer).    PCTEF  reporting  continues  until  redeployment  or release  from  the  orders  for  the  assigned  mission  (T-0).    While  an  assigned  mission  normally requires  a  unit  to  deploy  away  from  its  home  station,  PCTEF  reporting  requirements  can  also apply  to  assigned  missions  executed  by  a  unit  from  its  home  station  location  (e.g.,  Operation NOBLE  EAGLE).    PCTEF  reporting  is  not  required  for  training  exercises.    When  reporting PCTEF, a commander will only assess resources organic to the unit, and the assessment will only consider those assets directly supporting the assigned mission (T-1).  For example, a unit might have  24  aircraft  and  36  crews,  but  only  6  aircraft  and  9  crews  are  supporting  an  assigned mission.  The commander’s PCTEF assessment would be for the 6 aircraft and 9 crews, and their ability  to  execute  the  assigned  mission.    If  a  unit  uses  loaned  equipment,  aircraft,  and/or personnel  to  complete  an  assigned  mission,  then  the  unit  is  meeting  its  assigned  mission requirement.  However, any impacts to the unit’s ability to meet its full-spectrum mission(s) (i.e., the situation that created the need for loaned resources) will be addressed via the C-Level (T-2). 3.7.1.  While reporting PCTEF, units will continue reporting overall C-Level (T-0).  PCTEF, or “A-Level”, will not necessarily correlate with a unit’s overall C-Level.  For example, if the unit  has  an  assigned  mission,  PCTEF  will  capture  the  commander’s  assessment  against  the  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 33 current assigned mission, while the overall C-Level will continue to assess the unit’s ability to execute its full-spectrum mission(s) for which it is organized or designed. 3.7.2.  For  units  with  multiple  assigned  missions,  the  value  (1-4)  in  the  PCTEF  field  will reflect  the  lowest  A-level  rating  for  the  assigned  missions  (e.g.,  a  unit  with  an  Operation NEW DAWN and an Operation ENDURING FREEDOM tasking) (T-0).  However, the unit commander  will  include  a  PCTEF  remark  for  each  assigned  mission  (T-0).    If  a  unit  has resources preparing for an assigned mission, in addition to other resources already deployed for  an  assigned  mission,  that  unit  will  use  the  PCTEF  field  to  assess  its  already  deployed assets,  accompanied  by  commander’s  remarks  to  show  an  assessment(s)  of  the  other resources preparing to deploy (T-1). 3.7.3.  Use the following definitions to report the commander’s subjective estimate of unit’s ability to undertake assigned mission(s): 3.7.3.1.  Report  a  PCTEF  A-level  of  1  ('1'  in  PCTEF  field)  if  the  unit  possesses  the required resources and is trained to undertake the assigned mission(s). 3.7.3.2.  Report  a  PCTEF  A-level  of  2  ('2'  in  PCTEF  field)  if  the  unit  possesses  the required resources and is trained to undertake most of the assigned mission(s). 3.7.3.3.  Report  a  PCTEF  A-level  of  3  ('3'  in  PCTEF  field)  if  the  unit  possesses  the required resources and is trained to undertake many, but not all, portions of the assigned mission(s). 3.7.3.4.  Report a PCTEF A-level of 4 ('4' in PCTEF field) if the unit requires additional resources  or  training  to  undertake  the  assigned  mission(s);  however,  the  unit  may  be directed to undertake portions of the mission(s) with the resources on-hand. 3.7.3.5.  When  no  other  requirement  exists  to  report  data  in  this  field,  select  the  blank space from the drop-down menu. 3.7.4.  Commander’s  remarks  are  mandatory  when  reporting  in  the  PCTEF  field  (T-1).  Using plain text under the PCTEF label, identify the assigned mission (e.g., Operation NEW DAWN,  Operation  ENDURING  FREEDOM);  current  status  (deployed  or  preparing  to deploy);  percent  of  resources  (personnel  and  equipment)  tasked  to  deploy  or  deployed; deployment dates; description of any reduced readiness condition(s) for the assigned mission; and  any  action(s)  underway  or  planned  to  remedy  the  reduced  readiness  condition(s)  to include  a  GWD,  if  determinable.    Format  the  PCTEF  remark  according  to  the  example below: 3.7.4.1.  “PCTEF  3,  Operation  ENDURING  FREEDOM,  deployed  (50%  percent  of resources), 01JUN11 – 30NOV11; status reflects reduced effectiveness due to a shortage of  spare  engines  at  our  deployed  location;  spare  engines  enroute;  GWD  is  based  on estimated arrival of engines, expecting A-2 by 01AUG11.” 3.7.5.  MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  MAJCOM  Readiness  Offices,  in  coordination  with  Plans offices,  and  Air  Force  Personnel  Center  (AFPC)/DPW  will,  upon  request  from  AF/A3OR, provide  deployment  data  to  include  units/UTCs  that  are  deployed  and  those  that  are preparing to deploy.  AF/A3OR will specify the data required and date ranges for the data.  34 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 3.7.6.  In  addition  to  supplying  PCTEF  assessment,  commanders  will  assess  against  the applicable Named Operation (if applicable) in their Capability Assessment IAW Paragraph  8.4.2 3.8.  The Air  Force Input Tool  (AF-IT).  The medium AF measured units input, validate, and submit  their  Resource  Readiness  Assessments.   It,  to  the  maximum  extent  possible, automatically  populates  and  calculates  readiness  data  from  an  ADS  to  the  respective  measured resource area. 3.8.1.  General  guidelines.    AF-IT  uses  a  respective  unit’s  MilPDS  Deployable  Indicator Code (DEPID-9) UTC to apply a given rule set to retrieve data.  The tool takes the DEPID-9 UTC and applies the specific rule-set for the measured area.  All alike DEPID-9 coded units are treated similarly, regardless of parent MAJCOM.  The rule-sets for each individual type of unit can be found in the AF Tables in DRRS.  Information is packetized in each measured area  in  order  to  discern  specific  resource  deficiencies.    Additionally,  each  packet  of  data usually has a minimum threshold number so that singular deficiencies do not adversely affect overall  resource  reporting  by  eliminating  them  from  consideration  in  the  overall  C-Level determination. 3.8.2.  Packets.  AF-IT groups data into packets to determine overall criticality.  Packets are a grouping of like items (e.g., AFSCs, pieces of equipment) that are used to establish minimum criterion  for  readiness.    It  is  used  to  facilitate  the  measurement  of  a  specific  resource  item, made  up  either  by  individual  line  items  or  a  grouping  of  line  items  as  determined  by  the functional community.  The content of each packet is based upon the specific table the packet supports (i.e., personnel, training, or equipment).  For example: A unit has five trucks.  All five may be different types, but all five can carry boxes.  The trucks would be grouped in a packet and count against each other.  Conversely, if a unit has five officers consisting of two pilots, one navigator, and two Intel, not all five can fly a jet; therefore, only the pilots would be together in a packet to identify any LIMFACs in readiness. 3.8.3.  AF-IT Calculations.  When data involved in calculations is less than nine, AF-IT will use Table 3.5 to calculate associated percentage.  For personnel, equipment and supplies on-hand  and  condition,  and  training,  AF-IT  will  use  Table  3.6  through    3.11  to  convert percentages into associated C-Levels. 3.8.4.  The  Air  Force  Tables,  located  on  DRRS  homepage  under  Documents,  contain  the current  information  on  items  considered  in  the  calculation  of  C-Level  data.    The  Tables provide an avenue to identify specific information in individual ADSs to populate AF-IT.  3.8.5.  ADS  Information.    Units  should  become  familiar  with  applicable  ADSs,  their corresponding  coordination  offices,  and  the  information  available  for  their  unit.    In  cases where  the  data  is  inaccurate  within  the  ADS,  units  will  fix the  ADS  (vice  having  incorrect information  in  DRRS)  (T-1).    Units  may  have  to  contact  their  MAJCOM  FAM  for  further assistance in correcting ADSs, and if necessary, provide a remark to identify the error in the report.    Personnel  ADSs  include  PAS,  MPES,  MilPDS,  Defense  Civilian  Personnel  Data System  (DCPDS),  and  Individual  Medical  Readiness  (IMR).    Equipment  ADSs  include LIMS-EV  (weapons  systems,  engines,  pods,  and  vehicles),  AFEMS,  ILS-S,  MRDSS (medical  units),  and  ACES  (civil  engineer  units).    Training  ADSs  include  TBA,  AFTR, AAMS  (Automated  Aircrew  Management  System),  PEX  (Patriot  Excalibur),  ARMS  (all aviation  units),  MRDSS  (medical  units),  and  ACES  (civil  engineering  units).    If  a  unit’s  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 35 resources are not tracked in an ADS, the unit will notify their MAJCOM or AFIMSC FAM who will work with AF/A3OR to capture its resources in an ADS to populate AF-IT (T-2). 3.9.  Preparing Narrative Remarks.  Remarks are a critical component of resource assessments and are required when a measured resource subarea percentage drives a measured area level less than  1.    See  Table  3.2,  Standard  Reason  Codes  for  Air  Force  Units.    Remarks  will  highlight problem  areas  for  each  individual  label  regardless  of  whether  the  reported  percentage  is  the actual driver of the overall C-Level.  Remarks will be written IAW with the following guidance: 3.9.1.  Use  remarks  to  give  supplemental  information  concerning  unit  Overall  C-Level,  or measured  area  level,  and  LIMFACs.    Remarks  must  be  checked  and  verified  for  accuracy each  time  any  portion  of  a  report  is  submitted  (T-1).    Revise  content  and  remark  date  as necessary to maintain validity.  Remove remarks that no longer apply.  If the same remarks from the previous report remain valid, resubmit the remarks and update the remark date  (T-1). 3.9.2.  As described in Paragraph 3.9, progressively report on each label requiring a remark.  DRRS  information  consumers  often  selectively  retrieve  specific  pieces  of  data  from  the database  and  need  to  know  the  location  of  the  remark  that  explains  the  data  they  retrieve.  Write remarks in plain English.  Acronyms must be spelled out in each remark area it is used (T-0).  Additional uses of a defined acronym in  the same remark field may reflect only the acronym.    As  readiness  assessments  are  dynamic  and  remarks  may  change  from  report  to report,  do  not  refer  to  previous  Resource  Readiness  Assessments.    Do  not  submit  remarks referencing  other  remarks  (e.g.,  See  REASN  remark),  each  remark  must  stand  on  its  own content  (T-0).    In  general,  list  resource types with  their problems.  State  numbers required, assigned,  and  available;  explain  the  cause  of  the  problem,  if  known;  identify  previously requested assistance and remedial actions in progress; highlight further actions required; and supply  a  GWD  for  when  a  unit  will  be  at  least  C-2,  able  to  accomplish  most  of  its  full-spectrum mission(s).  See Paragraph 3.9.5.4. for GWD specifics.   3.9.3.  Remarks should be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details needed.  All remarks remain in the database until changed or deleted.  3.9.4.  The  auto-populated  data  in  the  Remarks  (i.e.,  PERTP,  PERTC,  TRUTC,  EQSEE, EQSSE,  EQREE,  and  EQRED)  contains  the  top  five  deficient  packets  (PERTP  will  auto-populate with the top five deficient AFSCs).  This information is mandatory and may not be deleted.  The REASN remark auto-populates with the PRRES, ESRES, ERRES, and TRRES if  the  measured  areas  are  less  than  1.    Reference  Attachment  1  for  the  definitions  of  the aforementioned acronyms. 3.9.4.1.  Units  may  include  additional  information  to  the  auto-populated  remarks  to supplement or explain disagreements with the auto-populated data.  3.9.5.  The  PRRES,  ESRES,  ERRES,  and  TRRES  remarks  must  contain  the  following information when the overall measured area is less than 1: 3.9.5.1.  Issue  (Concern/Shortfall):  Provide  a  thorough  explanation  of  the  issue  using layman’s terms (T-1).  If the issue is resource centric (e.g., lack of equipment on-hand) units  may  provide  appropriate  information,  such  as  overall  assemblage  details,  part numbers,  National  Stock  Numbers  (NSN),  nomenclature,  quantity  authorized,  quantity on-hand, quantity on-order, and expected delivery date.  36 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 3.9.5.2.  Impact: Describe the mission impact providing a risk assessment (T-1).  Provide a layman’s explanation of the mission impact. 3.9.5.3.  Fix  Action  (Mitigation/Solution,  Way  Ahead,  Recommendation):  Identify actions being taken or assistance needed to improve the unit’s readiness  (T-1).  Identify previously  requested  assistance  and  remedial  actions  in  progress;  explain  unit,  wing,  or MAJCOM actions taken to resolve shortfalls. 3.9.5.4.  GWD: Provide a realistic GWD for each remark.  Use the day, month and year (DDMMYY)  date  format  (e.g.,  010615).    If  GWD  is  unknown,  contact  the  applicable MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM for assistance in establishing a GWD.  Determine the GWD as to when the unit will reach at least a Level-2 in the measured area(s) affected.  If GWD is still unknown, after MAJCOM FAM and higher headquarter coordination, then it can be considered undeterminable. 3.9.6.  For the Personnel area, explain the following: 3.9.6.1.  Write  a  remark  using  the  PRRES  label  (Primary  Reason  Measured  Resource Area Level for Personnel not P-1) to discuss the personnel area when less then P-1 (T-0). 3.9.6.2.  Remarks should specify the main driver(s) of why the unit is less than P-1 (e.g., AFSC  shortages,  skill-level  shortages,  civilian  shortages  by  Occupational  Classification Code  (OCC),  critical  shortages  by  AFSC,  skill-level  and/or  OCC,  and/or  availability issues like duty status or DAV codes). 3.9.6.3.  The PERTP remark auto-populates if total personnel drives the P-Level below a “1”.  The PERTC remark auto-populates if critical personnel drives the P-Level below a 1. 3.9.7.  For the Equipment and Supplies On-hand and Equipment Condition area, explain the following: 3.9.7.1.  Write  a  remark  using  the  ESRES  label  (Primary  Reason  Measured  Resource Area Level for Equipment and Supplies not S-1) when Equipment and Supplies On-hand is less than S-1.  Ensure remarks accurately reflect the specified reason code (Table 5.1) and contain all pertinent details such as readiness driver overall assemblage details, NSN, item data, GWD, kit serial number (as applicable), on-hand versus authorized quantities, POC, etc.   3.9.7.1.1.  For units that  centrally store equipment  or supplies for multiple units and are responsible for reporting inventory and status of the equipment or supplies, those units will note that they centrally manage the equipment and will also list the stock-level percentage required to maintain, by regulation, within the remarks (T-1). 3.9.7.2.  For units providing rationale for the Equipment  Condition  area,  write a  remark using the ERRES label (Primary Reason Measured Resource Area Level  for Equipment Condition  not  R-1)  when  Equipment  and  Supplies  Condition  is  less  than  R-1.    Ensure remarks  accurately  reflect  the  specified  reason  code  (see  Table  5.2)  and  contain  all pertinent details. (T-0). 3.9.8.  For the Training area, explain the following:  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 37 3.9.8.1.  Write  a  remark  using  the  TRRES  label  (Primary  Reason  Measured  Resource Area Level for Training not T-1) when the training condition is less than T-1.  3.9.8.2.  Regardless  of  training  method,  when  multiple  subareas  are  less  than  T-1, summarize problems in a remark using the TRRES label.  3.9.8.3.  When  current  or  forecasted  Air  Education  and  Training  Command  (AETC) formal  training  school  allocation  deficiencies  exist,  write  a  remark  using  the  Training Measured  Resource  Area  (TRRAT)  label.    Begin  the  narrative  remark  with  “AETC:” followed by the deficiency short title, and continue with a detailed summary of current or future deficiency, the current  status  or action taken to  resolve the deficiency, additional actions  required,  and  the  impact  on  the  unit’s  ability  to  undertake  its  wartime  mission.  Format the TRRAT remark in accordance with Figure 3.2: Figure 3.2.  TRRAT Remark for AETC Formal Training School Allocation Deficiencies. AETC: (list short title deficiency or future requirement) CURRENT STATUS/ACTION ADDITIONAL ACTIONS IMPACT ON UNIT FUTURE REQUIREMENT(S)  3.9.9.  Overall C-Level data must be explained in a REASN label remark (i.e., reason unit is not C-1) (T-0).  The remark should summarize problems in sufficient detail to ascertain unit readiness  and  prompt  review  of  specific  measured  area  remarks.    Commanders  may  not amend remarks that are auto-populated via AF-IT, but can add further explanatory comments to amplify unit specifics.  Examples of further explanatory remarks are: 3.9.9.1.  Mission(s) the unit cannot fully support or undertake when its C-Level is worse than C-1. 3.9.9.2.  The  commander’s  rationale,  supporting  a  subjectively  assessed  downward  C-Level and area(s) where the commander disagrees with the measured area C-Level. 3.9.9.3.  The  programmed  or  estimated  date  the  unit  will  again  be  able  to  undertake  its full  spectrum  mission(s),  if  less  than  C-1  or  after  undergoing  a  major  equipment conversion or transition (C-5). 3.9.9.4.  Units  receiving  a  Unit  Effectiveness  Inspection  (UEI)  overall  rating  of “INEFFECTIVE”  or  a  Nuclear  Surety rating  of “UNSATISFACTORY”  should  lower  their  Overall  C-Level  and  provide  remarks outlining deficiencies and resource improvement timetables until  the deficiency causing the unsatisfactory rating is resolved.  Units may assume successful re-inspection, when it is required and the inspection team provides applicable dates.  Provide remarks to explain the condition in the REASN label (T-1). (NSI)  overall Inspection 3.9.9.5.  When  a  unit  is  unable  to  meet  the  requirement  of  its  quarterly/semi-annual/annual  training  plan  (e.g.,  RAP),  units  will  consider  assessing  downward  in  the overall C-Level.  When the commander assesses downward for the training plan shortfall, overall REASN remarks will be prefaced with “TRNG PLAN RQMT” (T-1).  38 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 3.10.  Overall Reason Codes. 3.10.1.  Assigning a Primary Reason Code (PRC).  Units must report a reason code against the Overall C-Level using the reason codes in Table 3.2, unless reporting C-1 (T-0).  When partially deployed, use  D/E/F/G  (T-0).  See  Table  3.4 for additional clarification on use of PRCs. 3.10.1.1.  Expanded  reason  codes  D,  E,  F,  or  G  (DEFG)  will  be  used  to  reflect  the commander’s  assessment  of  the  percent  of  unit  deployable  capability  that  is  currently deployed.  This information is used to assess risk of resources not being made available to redeploy (T-0). 3.10.2.  Reporting a PRC.  The PRC will be entered in the REASN field (T-0). 3.10.2.1.  When the Overall C-Level is less than C-1, determine the resource area having the  greatest  impact  on  the  lowered  C-Level.    Use  “P”  for  personnel,  “S”  for  equipment and supplies on hand (O/H), “R” for equipment condition, and “T” for training. 3.10.2.2.  If  the  Overall  C-Level  is  changed  to  a  lower  level  by  the  commander’s assessment, the X reason code will be used (T-0).  See Table 3.2 for reason codes. 3.10.2.3.  If the Overall C-Level is based solely on measured area calculations (REASN not  X  and  not  C-1)  and  the  unit  is  partially  deployed,  P,  S,  R,  or  T  will  be  placed  in REASN  and  the  D/E/F/G  as  described  below  will  be  placed  in  the  Secondary  Reason Organization Not C-1 (SECRN) field (T-0).  For PCTEF guidance, reference Paragraph  3.7 3.10.2.4.  If the Overall C-Level is C-1, and there is no partial deployment reflected (no D/E/F/G needed), with one or more of the resource areas not measured, a 6 reason code will be used (T-0).  No remarks are required for a 6 reason code. 3.10.2.5.  If the Overall C-Level is capped by AF FAMs, (e.g., due to resource allocation) below  C-1,  enter  the  maximum  level  possible  in  the  Category  Level  Limitation  (LIM) label  for  primary  missions.    Enter  a  “P”,  “S”,  “R”,  or  “T”  in  the  Reason  for  Category Level  Limitation (RLIM) label for the area most affected by the resource allocation  (T-1). 3.11.  Assigning a Secondary or Tertiary Reason Code.  If the Overall C-Level is changed to a lower level by the commander, enter X in REASN field and assign a secondary code to explain the primary reason for the change of C-Level (T-0).  See Table 3.4 for additional clarification on use of secondary and tertiary reason codes. 3.11.1.  When  downgrading,  use  the  applicable  reason  codes  in  Chapter  4,  Chapter  5, Chapter 6, and Chapter 7 (T-0).  3.11.2.  SECRN  and  Tertiary  Reason  Organization  Not  C-1  (TERRN)  are  mandatory  if REASN equals X, Overall C-Level is less than 1, and assets are deployed.  D, E, F, or G is used in SECRN field, and proper reason code in TERRN (T-0). 3.12.  Special  Capabilities  (SPECAP)  Data.  SPECAP  are  special  capabilities  listed  in  the SMCC Table in AF Tables on the DRRS Homepage, under Documents.  The ADS for SPECAP Data  is  the  WMP-3  Part  1,  Appendix  C.    The  applicable  codes  are  entered  in  the  SMCC  1 through 4 data fields.  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 39 3.12.1.  MAJCOM  FAMs  coordinate  with  the  parent  MAJCOM  Readiness  Office  to  notify AF/A3OR of approved changes to the SMCC Table. 3.12.2.  SMCCs  entered  in  the  Overall  Tab  provide  informational  data  but  do  not  drive  C-Level  calculations.  These capabilities are measured in  CAF Training under Method C (see Para  6.4).

Personnel.  Personnel measurements are based on a unit’s authorized and funded positions in its UMD.  Units compute the personnel P-Level, based on the percentages of total and critical personnel authorized, assigned, and available to accomplish the unit’s full spectrum mission(s).  The  following  systems  are  used  for  personnel  availability:  MPES  (funded  authorizations), MilPDS  (assigned  individuals  to  include  overages),  DoD  Civilian  Personnel  Data  System (DCPDS) and IMR (medical availability).  Total personnel (PERTP) will measure all individuals on  the  unit’s  UMD  to  include  military,  civilians,  and  foreign  nationals.    Critical  personnel (PERTC)  will  measure  only  individuals  by  AFSC  or  OCC  as  identified  on  the  AF  Tables  in DRRS.  4.1.1.  Total Personnel. 4.1.1.1.  Total  Personnel  Authorized authorized/funded billets in the UMD which is auto-populated from MPES to AF-IT. for  all  units (TPAUTH) is  based  on 4.1.1.2.  Total Personnel Assigned (TPASG) is determined by counting all personnel in a unit  from  the  time  they  arrive  at  the  unit  until  they  depart  on  a  Permanent  Change  of Station (PCS), Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA), or separate from the Air Force.  All personnel are counted for TPASG regardless of AFSC, skill level, or grade and may exceed the TPAUTH number.  MilPDS and DCPDS are the ADSs for TPASG. 4.1.1.3.  Total Personnel Available (TPAVL) is determined by calculating the number of TPASG available to the unit within the DOC Statement response time.  See  Paragraph 4.2.  for  specific  availability  guidance.    Both  TPAVL  and  Critical  Personnel  Available (CPAVL) are “editable" fields in AF-IT to allow CCs to make adjustments based on their determination  if  an  individual  is  'available'  for  duty.    If  a  UA/UC  disagrees  with TPAUTH and TPASG, they will address the discrepancy with the applicable ADS POC.  CCs should review personnel statuses to ensure accurate TPAVL are counted regardless of current deployed/employed location, AFSC, skill level, or grade, and may exceed the TPAUTH number. 4.1.1.4.  DoD civilians are included in calculations in the personnel area.  4.1.1.4.1.  Do not count civilian personnel as available if they have Reserve or Guard commitments during crisis or wartime that can make them subject to recall. 4.1.1.4.2.  The AF Tables will indicate if DoD civilians are counted towards PERTC. 4.1.1.5.  Positions  filled  by  foreign  local  nationals  will  be  counted  as  authorizations,  if part of the unit’s UMD; as such, they are considered DoD civilians.  4.1.2.  Critical Personnel. 4.1.2.1.  The  reporting  of  critical  personnel  is  based  on  AFSCs  identified  by  the  HAF FAM  in  conjunction  with  MAJCOM/AFIMSC  FAM  coordination  (as  applicable)  and detailed  in  the  AF  Tables  in  DRRS  –  Auto  Populate-Auto  Calculate  (APAC) Personnel  Table  found  on  the  DRRS  homepage,  under  Documents.    Critical  personnel  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 45 are those identified as essential to the launch, recovery, or turnaround of a unit’s weapon system,  or  direct  accomplishment  of  the  unit’s  full-spectrum  mission.    They  are  critical because  their  absence  would  materially  affect  the  mission.    Personnel  are  considered “critical” if they meet one or more of the following criteria: 4.1.2.1.1.  Personnel  with  AFSC(s)  essential  to  fulfilling  the  unit’s  mission  tasks based on authorized/funded billets. 4.1.2.1.2.  Absence  of  personnel  possessing  AFSC(s)  and/or  OCC(s)  that  would render the unit severely deficient or totally unable to execute its mission. 4.1.2.1.3.  AFSC  is  part  of  a  critically  manned  career  field  subject  to  special monitoring. 4.1.2.2.  Applicable critical AFSCs for officers are identified first by their duty then their primary  AFSC.    Applicable  critical  AFSCs  for  enlisted  are  identified  first  by  their control, then their primary, then their duty AFSC. 4.1.2.3.  Civilians,  to  include  Foreign  Local  Nationals,  can  be  counted  as  critical  by listing  their  OCC  in  the  AF  Tables  –  APAC  Personnel  Table  found  on  the  DRRS homepage, under Documents. 4.1.2.4.  Critical  Personnel  Authorized  (CPAUR)  is  determined  by  counting  the  number of TPAUTH positions that match the AFSC/skill levels/OCC(s) listed in the AF Tables – APAC Personnel Table as described in Paragraph 4.1.2.3. 4.1.2.5.  Critical Personnel Assigned (CPASG) is determined by counting the number of critical personnel assigned to authorized positions on the UMD within a given packet.  In order for APAC to work correctly, an officer must have a matching duty and/or primary AFSC  and  enlisted  personnel  must  have  a  matching  control  and/or  primary  AFSC compared to the critical positions requirement on the UMD (T-1). 4.1.2.6.  CPAVL is determined by calculating the number of CPASG available to the unit within  the  unit’s  mission  response  time  (see  Paragraph  4.2.  for  specific  availability guidance). 4.1.2.7.  Critical personnel overages (percentages exceeding 100), not APAC reported in the  CPASG  and  CPAVL  data  fields,  must  be  reported  by  using  a  remark  under  the applicable  label  (CPASG  or  CPAVL).    AF-IT  will  allow  for  overages  to  be  placed  in packet information, but will only display a maximum of 100%.   4.1.2.8.  Skill level substitutions are not authorized. 4.1.3.  Special Provisions for Personnel Counting. 4.1.3.1.  Personnel TDY or temporarily attached to a measured unit will not be included in the gaining unit’s assigned and available numbers (T-1). 4.1.3.2.  Units  with  a  joint  mission  that  have  multiple  service  personnel  assigned, attached,  or  a  combination  of  active  and  reserve  component  personnel  will  use  their respective service or component UMD to  determine total  personnel  requirements  (T-1).  For example, a total force unit requires support from the Army, Navy, and Air National Guard; the Army operating location (OL) has a UMD of 20 personnel, the Navy OL 20 personnel, the ANG unit 100 personnel, and the RegAF unit 150 personnel, resulting in a  46 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 total  requirement  of 290.  Critical  personnel will  be assessed using the same  guidelines based on specific AFSC requirements listed in the UMD (T-1). 4.1.3.3.  AFRC and ANG personnel attached to an RegAF unit, for training purposes, will not  be  included  in  RegAF  personnel  numbers  (T-1).      Likewise,  RegAF  personnel attached to AFRC and ANG units will not be included in the AFRC and ANG personnel numbers (T-1). 4.2.  Determining  Personnel  Availability.  Unit personnel may be considered available if they are assigned to the unit and meet one of the following requirements: 4.2.1.  Can  be  utilized  within  the  prescribed  unit  response  time,  regardless  of  current deployed/employed location.  4.2.2.  Not  restricted  from  deploying  or  employing  with  the  unit.    Personnel  with  a  DAV code  or  Duty  Limiting  Condition  (DLC)  may  be  restricted  from  deploying;  however,  they may  still  be  counted  as  available  if  used  to  support  the  in-place  mission.    A  US  military member  on  leave  could  be  recalled;  a  person  close  to  retirement  or  separation  could  be retained via stop-loss program. 4.2.3.  Their  duty  status/DAV  code(s)  in  AF-IT  Personnel  Availability  Roster  and  the  Duty Status  Roster  match  those  from  AFI  10-403,  Deployment  Planning  and  Execution,  and  the commander determines them available where appropriate.   4.2.3.1.  Commanders  will  use  IMR  when  determining  personnel  availability  (T-1).  Personnel  having  a duty limiting code restricting them from  deployment  (IAW AFI 10-203,  Duty  Limiting  Conditions)  may  be  considered  available  for  in-garrison  mission tasks, as determined by the commander. 4.2.3.2.  When  a  unit  temporarily  transfers  (lends)  personnel  to  another  unit,  the supplying  measured  unit  will  continue  to  measure  and  report  the  personnel  unless otherwise  directed  by  the  MAJCOM(s)  involved.    Likewise,  a  unit  receiving  personnel from another unit will not measure or count those personnel unless otherwise directed (T-1).  All MAJCOMs involved must ensure no two units report on the same resources. 4.2.3.3.  Do not count non-appropriated funds positions (civilians with reported pay plans of NA, NL, NS, NF, AS, PS, or CC) and where DCPDS reports an invalid pay plan. 4.2.3.4.  To ensure that an authorization, sourced from the UMD, is not counted twice or that medical students are not counted, do not count billets with a Resource Identification Code (RIC) of 0018 (Reserve  Air  Force  Off-24  Drill), 0019 (Reserve Air Force Off-48 Drill),  0022  (Reserve  Air  Force  Off-Other),  0044  (Act  Air  Force  Off  Students,  0118 (Reserve Air Force Enl-24 Drill), 0122 (Reserve Air Force Enl-Other), 0123 (Reserve Air Force  Enl-48  Drill),  0134  (Act  Air  Force  Enl  Students),  0163  (Reserve  Civilian Technicians,  and  0170  (Natl  Grd  Civ  Technicians).   AF-IT  will  exclude  the aforementioned RICs from APAC. 4.2.3.4.1.  RIC billets may be found in the unit’s account in MPES. 4.2.3.4.2.  Medical  units  will  not  count  assigned  patients  (normally  assigned  AFSC 93P0 or 9P000) in personnel calculations.    AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 47 4.3.  Personnel Reason Codes. 4.3.1.

Equipment  and  Supplies  On-hand  Reporting.  Equipment  and  supplies  on-hand measurement  is  used  to  indicate  the  equipment  and  supplies  the  unit  possesses,  on-hand,  to support  its  full  spectrum  mission(s),  as  designed  and  organized.    Equipment  and  supplies  on-hand reporting is based on a unit’s authorizations, through an AF approved ADS (e.g., AFEMS, ACES  and  ILS-S)  listing  all  authorized  and  funded  equipment  and  supplies.    If  a  piece  of equipment is not autopopulated in AF-IT, units will work with Wing Readiness POCs to notify MAJCOM Readiness Offices to ensure it is captured in the AF Tables (T-1). 5.2.  Equipment  and  Supplies  Packets.  This  measured  area  allows  an  unlimited  number  of packets annotated in the AF Tables.  Consider the following: 5.2.1.  Item  Possession.    To  determine  the  number  of  items  a  unit  will  possess  within  its response time, the unit must have actual responsibility for the items according to applicable supply regulations. The following items are not considered possessed: 5.2.1.1.  Additional and/or backup inventory in excess of the number authorized. 5.2.1.2.  In most cases, items in Programmed Depot-Level Maintenance (PDM) or Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) depot modification. 5.2.1.3.  Items  temporarily  in  the  hands  of  another  unit  due  to  long  term  maintenance (lasting  more  than  seven  days,  or  for  crash  or  battle  damage  repair)  are  not  considered possessed by the receiving unit. 5.2.1.4.  Items  loaned  to  another  unit  to  augment  their  resources  will  be  counted  as possessed  by  the  owning  unit.    The  receiving  unit  will  not  use  these  resources  for readiness reporting.  Items will not be double-counted (T-1). 5.3.  Combat Essential and Support Equipment On-hand. 5.3.1.  Determine  unit  combat  essential  versus  support  specification  using  the  APAC Equipment Table found on the DRRS homepage, under Documents. 5.4.  Equipment  and  Supplies  On-hand  S-Level  Calculations.  AF-IT divides the Equipment Possessed by the Equipment Authorized to arrive at a given percentage.  AF-IT then calculates the given S-Level per Table 3.8  5.4.1.  Report  S-6 MAJCOM/AFIMSC. in  ESRAT  and  S-6 in  ESRES if  specifically  authorized  by 5.5.  Equipment  and  Supplies  on-hand  Reason  Codes.  Select  the  most  specific  reason  code from Table 5.1 when the Equipment and Supplies On-hand S-Level is less than S-1.  Note the selected reason code.  If the reason code has changed since the last report, ensure the new code is populated. 5.6.  Non-Returnable  Deployed  Equipment.  Occasionally,  a  unit  may  own  equipment  that  is required to be left in the contingency Area of Responsibility (AOR) when the unit redeploys to its  home  station.    The  deployed  RegAF  equipment  custodian  will  coordinate  the  transfer  of  50 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 equipment with the owning Equipment Accountability Element (EAE).  The Reserve and Guard equipment  custodians  will  coordinate  with  their MAJCOM Command  Equipment  Management Office  prior  to  leaving/transferring  any  equipment/supplies  IAW  DoDI  1225.06,  Equipping  the Reserve  Forces.  Upon  notification  of  deployment  termination,  the  Expeditionary  Logistics Readiness Squadron will assist custodians with inventorying equipment and forward all pertinent shipping  information  to  the  home  station  owning  custodian  and  EAE  IAW  AFMAN  23-122, Materiel  Management  Procedures.    Once  re-deployed,  the  unit  will  no  longer  count  that equipment as on-hand because that equipment has been removed from the supply account.  Once the unit reaches home station and the equipment has been added back to their supply account and re-supplied, the unit will resume counting the equipment as on-hand (T-1). 5.7.  Equipment  Condition  Reporting.  The  Equipment  Condition  measured  area  is  used  to measure  the  combat  essential  and  support  equipment  that  can  be  made  ready  within  the  unit’s response  time  to  undertake  the  unit’s  full  mission  set.    This  measure  is  also  used  to  indicate maintenance  and  equipment  reliability,  serviceability,  and  operational  status  of  assets.    Units compute the equipment condition R-Level for combat essential and support equipment based on the availability of wartime required equipment.  Equipment items are considered available if they are  possessed  by  the  unit  and  are,  or  can  be,  made  mission  ready  within  the  prescribed  unit response time.  5.7.1.  Some ADSs do not track equipment condition (e.g., AFEMS).  AF-IT will default the condition  to  available;  therefore,  units  must  input  whether  said  piece  of  equipment  is available. 5.8.  Equipment  Condition  R-Level  Calculations.  AF-IT  divides  the  equipment  available  by the equipment possessed to arrive at a given percentage.  AF-IT calculates the R-Level per Table 3.8  5.8.1.  Report  R-6 MAJCOM/AFIMSC. in  ERRAT  and  R-6 5.9.  Equipment Condition Reason Codes. in  ERRES if  specifically  authorized  by 5.9.1.  Select the most specific reason code from  Table 5.2, when the Equipment Condition R-Level is less than R-1. 5.9.2.  Note  the  selected  reason  code.    If  the  reason  code  has  changed  since  the  last  report, ensure that the new reason code is added in the ERRES label. 5.10.  Equipment  Considered  Mission  Ready  and  Available  (MRA).  Most  equipment  is considered  mission  ready  if  the  equipment  is  safe  to  use  and  in  the  condition  to  perform  the functions for which it was designed. 5.10.1.

Training.  Training requirements for assigned personnel will be measured using Method A, Method B (Crew/Team Training), and/or Method C (CAF Training).  For all reportable training by unit type, reference the  APAC  Training  Table in  the AF Tables on the DRRS Homepage, under  Documents.    ARC  units  will  not  count  newly  assigned  personnel  toward  training calculations  until  they  have  completed  either  technical  school  (for  AFRC  units),  or  Basic Military Training (BMT) plus 12 weeks of federal military service (for ANG units).  Regardless of method, if less than T-1, Table 6.1 is used to determine the reason code entered in TRRES (T-1). 6.2.  Method  A.  Method  A  computes  training  via  an  aggregated  percentage  of  qualification tasks,  or  via  specific  training  qualification(s)  or  event(s).    Units  may  use  multiple,  different ADSs to calculate their T-Level. 6.2.1.  For AFSCs that utilize AFTR or TBA, AF-IT identifies the specified AFSC skill level, then takes the total qualification tasks completed and divides by the total qualification tasks enrolled.  This provides an aggregated “percent qualified” for the specific AFSC skill level. 6.2.2.  For AFSCs or units tracking training via specific training qualification(s) or event(s)  requirement(s) within a sub-area, determine the percentage of assigned personnel trained by: dividing the number trained by the number assigned with that requirement.   6.2.3.  For  units  using  an  ADS  that  has  specific  training  events  or  are  tracking  manually inputted training events in AF-IT, the following rules will be used: 6.2.3.1.  If a single type of training is listed, determine if everyone is required to have it. 6.2.3.1.1.  If  everyone  is  required  to  have  the  training,  use  the  number  of  total personnel  assigned,  up  to  the  number  of  personnel  authorized  to  the  unit,  as  the number required to be trained.    6.2.3.1.2.  If  everyone  is  not  required  to  have  the  training,  use  the  number  of  total personnel assigned that require the training. 6.2.4.  If  a  MAJCOM  or  AFIMSC  FAM  has  a  specific  manual  training  requirement,  the MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM will annotate specific requirements in the AF tables on the APAC Training Table and submit these changes to the HAF FAM, or lead FAM if there is no HAF FAM, for approval/addition to the tables. 6.3.  Method B:  Non-CAF Aircrew Training. 6.3.1.  AF-IT will calculate the number of crews trained and assigned based on data from the Automated Aircrew Management System (AAMS). 6.3.2.  For units that do not use AAMS for APAC: 6.3.2.1.  Find the number of crews assigned.   AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 57 6.3.2.1.1.  Use  AFI  65-503,  Air  Force  Cost  and  Planning  Factors,  for  crew composition  unless  modified  by  the  MAJCOM  because  of  unique  mission requirements. 6.3.2.1.2.  To  count  a  crew  as  assigned,  each  position  must  have  an  assigned crewmember. 6.3.2.2.  AFRC  units  will  not  count  1-levels  (officers  and  enlisted)  toward  training calculations  (T-1).    Those  AFRC  members  will  not  be  counted  towards  training calculations until  they have completed technical  school  (T-1).  Those enlisted members will not be counted until they have been awarded their 3-level (T-1).   6.3.2.3.  Aeromedical Evacuation crew authorizations are determined by adding together the number of crews tasked to the unit . 6.4.  Method C:  CAF Aviation Training.  Reference APAC Training Table in the AF Tables on  the  DRRS  homepage,  under  Documents,  for  units  using  this  method  and  what  to  report  for each  packet.    Units  will  use  the  lowest  percentage  for  the  following  categories:  Basic  Mission Capable  (BMC),  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR),  SPECAP  requirements,  and  Percent  of Mission-Essential Tasks Trained to Standard (T-1).   6.4.1.  If RAP is the primary means of articulating the annual training program, CMR will be based  on  sorties  counted  towards  RAP  completion  (T-1).    For  resource  reporting  purposes, aircrew on probation are not counted as trained.  This approach will best capture/tell the story of  the  health  of  aircrew  training,  when  aircrew  are  not  consistently  flying  the  minimum sorties,  missions,  and/or  events  as  directed  by  their  Mission  Design  Series  (MDS)  Vol  1s and/or RAP Tasking Memos.  If number assigned exceeds number authorized (i.e., identified in the UMD based on PMAI multiplied by crew ratio and by crew complement, if applicable) or other-than-aircrew AFSC training requirements exist, status of training for overages and/or other-than-aircrew AFSCs may be reported by AFSC in another sub-area. 6.4.1.1.  Personnel will be considered assigned for CMR training when occupying a CMR billet on the unit’s UMD (T-1). 6.4.2.  For  units  that  do  not  use  RAP  as  their  training  program,  CMR  will  be  based  on applicable training directives, such as the operational Flying Operations AFI Volume 1s, or as directed by their MAJCOM (T-1). 6.4.3.  Units will subjectively assess its progress in completing quarterly/semi-annual/annual training plan requirements (e.g., RAP) and apply the progress assessment toward their overall C-Level  (T-1).    Units  will  determine  their  C-Level  rating  based  on  the  lowest  percentage completion of either RAP primary or secondary mission.  If unable to meet the requirements of the training plan, commanders will assess downward the overall C-Level (T-1).  When the commander  assesses  downward  for  the  training  plan  shortfall,  overall  remarks  will  be prefaced with “TRNG PLAN REQMT” (T-1).   6.4.4.  Percent of Mission-Essential Tasks Trained to Standard Method will be calculated by first determining the total number of mission-essential tasks that must be trained to standard.  Then  for  each  assigned  individual,  determine  the  number  of  mission-essential  tasks  with  a currency  requirement  through  initial  or  recurring  training  as  identified  in  the  training directive; the plan identified by the authoritative organization or required by tasked CJCS- or  58 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 CCDR-directed OPLANs, Concept Plans (CONPLANs); or Service war planning documents to which the unit is apportioned.  This will be based on the RAP tasking message. 6.4.4.1.  Add the numbers for each assigned individual to get the total number of mission-essential tasks requiring training.   6.4.4.2.  Determine  the  total  number  of  mission-essential  tasks  for  which  assigned individuals  are  currently  qualified,  according  to  authoritative  organization  training directives and/or plans.   6.4.4.2.1.  Add  the  numbers  for  each  assigned  individual  to  get  the  total  number  of mission-essential tasks currently trained.   6.4.4.3.  Calculate  a  Training  Percentage.    Divide  the  number  of  mission-essential  tasks currently  trained  by  the  number  required,  multiply  the  result  by  100,  and  round  to  the next whole number. 6.5.  Just  in  Time  (JIT)  Training.  JIT  training  (such  as  CBRNE  training,  Group  B  airmen weapons training IAW AFI 31-117, Arming and Use of Force by Air Force Personnel, and Self Aid  Buddy  Care)  will  not  be  measured  in  T-Levels.    The  reasons  are  as  follows:  this  type  of training is usually not scheduled until the unit is either in its AEF window or tasked to deploy.  It also typically takes longer than a unit’s response time to train the entire unit, which results in a cyclic false negative trend in T-Level.  JIT cannot be maintained as typical currency items.  Air Force  has  accepted  that  risk  by  implementing  waiver  guidance  within  the  training  AFI(s).  CBRNE training will still be measured in the CBDRT IAW Chapter 7. 6.5.1.

CBDRT C-Level.  AF measured units who have personnel required to maintain currency in CBDRT  (e.g.,  Strike,  Mobility,  and  Command  and  Control  Intelligence  Surveillance  and Reconnaissance  (C2ISR)  AEF  teams)  or  who  maintain  CBDRT  equipment  (e.g.,  Logistics Readiness  Squadron  (LRS)  and  Operational  Support  Squadron  (OSS))  will  report  the  status  of CBDRT  (T-0).    The  CBDRT  is  used  to  assess  the  unit’s  ability  to  perform  the  mission(s)  for which the unit was organized or designed under chemical or biological conditions.  The CBDRT includes  an  overall  CBDRT  C-Level,  based  on  the  worse  of  two  measured  areas:  CBDRT Equipment  and  Supplies  On-hand  (S-Level)  and  CBDRT  (T-Level).    The  CBDRT  C-Level  is listed  in  AF-IT,  and  if  less  than  C-1,  a  reason  is  listed  in  the  CBDREASN  remark  field.    The applicable reason code from Table 7.3 will be listed in the CBDREASN field. 7.2.  CBDRT  S-Level.  Reportable CBRNE defense/response equipment  and supplies are listed in the CBDRT Equipment Table found in AF Tables on the DRRS homepage, under Documents.  The applicable reason code from  Table 7.3 is listed in the CBDREASN field.  If a unit has no requirement for equipment within a subarea, then “0” is entered. 7.3.  CBDRT  T-Level.  Reportable  CBRNE  defense/response  training  is  listed  in  the  CBDRT Table found in AF Tables on the DRRS homepage, under Documents.  The T-Level is entered in the CBDTRRAT field,  and if less than T-1, a reason is  listed in the CBDTRRES  remark field.  The applicable reason code from Table 7.3 is listed in CBDREASN field.

General  Rules.  Capability  Readiness  reporting  assesses  the  unit’s  ability  to  execute  the unit’s  designed  mission.    It  is  coupled  with  information  gleaned  from  the  Resource  Readiness Assessment  to  provide  a  complete  assessment  of  the  unit’s  capability  and  capacity  to  perform.  Capability Readiness Assessments require close integration of OPLANs, Concept of Operations (CONOPS),  training,  evaluations,  inspections,  exercises,  and  SMEs  responsible  for  different aspects  of a unit’s readiness.   The MET OPRs draw on their expertise, and the unit's ability to perform  the  task  when  making  mission  assessments.    Commanders  will  use  the  mission assessments along with the results of training, evaluations, inspections, exercises, their Resource Readiness Assessment, and ART reports to support their Capability Readiness Assessment (T-1).  The capabilities-based approach identifies the responsibilities of individuals and organizations in the  form  of  tasks,  conditions,  and  performance  standards.    The  assessment  of  resulting performance is captured in DRRS with Capability Readiness Assessments to validate Air Force and Joint training, and indicate unit task/mission readiness.   8.2.  Task  Readiness  Assessments.  Commanders  are  responsible  for  assessing  their  unit’s ability  to  accomplish  the  tasks  to  prescribed  performance  standards  under  specified  conditions.  This  assessment  should  be  based  upon  observed  performance,  resource  availability,  military experience,  and  judgment.  However,  when  observed  performance  is  not  recent,  assessed performance  will  be  used.    The  currency  of  observed  performance  depends  on  many  factors: complexity  of  tasks,  type  of  exercise,  size,  unit  personnel  changeover,  experience,  etc.    The ultimate authority is the unit commander (T-1). 8.2.1.  All assessments will be documented in accordance with the following definitions (T-0):  8.2.1.1.  "Yes"  (Y/Green):    Unit  can  accomplish  task  to  established  standard(s)  and condition(s). 8.2.1.2.  “Qualified  Yes"  (Q/Yellow):    Unit  can  accomplish  all  or  most  of  the  tasks  to standard under most conditions.  The specific standards and conditions that cannot be met as well  as shortfalls or issues affecting the unit's ability to accomplish  the task must be clearly detailed in the MET  assessment. 8.2.1.3.  "No"  (N/Red):    Unit  is  unable  to  accomplish  the  task  to  prescribed  standard(s) and condition(s) at this time. 8.2.1.4.  Anticipated change date in DRRS defaults to 30 days into the future.  Units will change the default date to the date they anticipate a change in their rating (T-0). 8.2.1.4.1.  If a unit is reporting “Y” and there is no anticipated change over the next 12-month  period,  the  anticipated  change  date  will  be  12  months  from  the  current report date (T-1). 8.2.2.  Commanders will assess a current status and an anticipated status (T-1). 8.2.3.  Remarks are mandatory whenever a "Qualified Yes" or "No" assessment is used, or a "Yes"  assessment on any  task is  used when  guidelines would indicate a "Qualified Yes" or  64 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 "No" (T-0).  A remark is also required when the unit’s Resource assessment and Capability assessment do not align per Paragraph  8.8 (T-1). 8.3.  Staff  Supporting  Tasks,  Subordinate  Unit  Tasks,  and  Command-Linked  Tasks.  Unit commanders/MAJCOMs/FAMs  may  use  assessments  of  their  subordinate  units,  internal  staffs, or other pre-designated external supporting organizations to inform their own MET assessments.  This  information  is  derived  from  staff  supporting  tasks,  subordinate  unit  tasks,  and  command-linked tasks. 8.3.1.  A  staff  supporting  task  is  performed  by  the  organization’s  internal  staff  elements.  OPRs  will  work  with  staff  elements  in  determining  appropriate  tasks,  conditions,  and standards (T-0).  Staff supporting task OPRs are assigned.  As with METs, these tasks should strongly  connect  to  the  mission—they  should  not  be  routine  activities,  such  as  keeping  the facility  clean,  maintaining  computers,  conducting  training  (unless  one  of  these  is  the organization’s mission). 8.3.2.  A  subordinate  unit  task  is  performed  by  organizations  below  the  linking  task  owner and in the same chain of command.  The task owner identifies subordinate unit task(s) from the  linked  unit’s  existing  METL  that  are  essential  to  accomplishing  the  MET.    If  the appropriate  task,  conditions,  and  standards  cannot  be  identified,  then  higher  headquarters coordinates  with  the  subordinate  unit’s  headquarters  to  determine  how  to  identify  the required support. 8.3.3.  A  command-linked  task  is  performed  by  organizations  external  to  the  task  owner’s chain of command.  The task owners identify command-linked tasks directly from the linked unit’s existing METL.  If the appropriate task, conditions, and standards cannot be identified, the linking organization coordinates directly with the service component/headquarters/agency to identify the required support.   8.3.3.1.  Command  linking  will  be  performed  when  the  capabilities  of  a  unit  depend largely  on  the  capabilities  of  a  supporting  unit  (e.g.,  an  operational  unit  linking  to maintenance, logistics, and operational support) (T-1).  Command linking can be made at different levels provided both organizations agree and the linking is coordinated.   8.3.4.  The  MET  assessment  guidelines  with  regard  to  staff-supporting,  subordinate-unit, command-linked tasks, and MET performance standards assessment are as follows:   8.3.4.1.  “Yes” (Y/Green):  If the majority (51 percent) of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as "Y," and the remaining supporting tasks are assessed as "Q,"  then the MET assessment should be "Y."  8.3.4.2.  “Qualified Yes” (Q/Yellow):  If the majority (51 percent) of the MET supporting tasks are assessed  as  "Q,"  and the remaining supporting tasks are  assessed as  "Y," then the MET assessment should be "Q."  8.3.4.3.  “No” (N/Red):    If any of the MET supporting tasks are assessed as “No,” then the commander must make a judgment as to whether the mission objectives can still be accomplished.    If  the  commander  makes  a  subjective  upgrade  for  an  overall  Capability Readiness  Assessment  to  other  than  “No,”  the  commander  will  clearly  explain  how  the mission  will  be  accomplished  despite  the  inability  to  accomplish  the  MET(s),  and  any mitigation actions taken (T-1).  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 65 8.3.4.4.  The  above  guidelines  are  subject  to  unit  commander's  judgment/weighting  of supporting tasks.   The  assessment  of  resources 8.4.  Mission  Assessment  Categories.  All measured units will assess a Core METL to include associated tasks, standards, and conditions as written in the AFUTL METL template, unless the MAJCOM  or  AFIMSC  FAM  approves  deviation  (T-0).    METLs  provide  the  means  for  a commander  to  assess  the  organization’s  ability  to  conduct  their  designed  and  assigned mission(s). informs  Capability  Readiness  Assessments; commanders  will  consider  their  Resource  assessment  in  their  assessment  of  their  Core  METL and  mission(s)  (T-1).    Additionally,  assessments  will  be  directly  informed  by  the  readiness assessments of supporting units whose assistance is needed to provide the unit’s capability (T-1).  For example, an aviation operations unit could base their core capability assessment on their own resources and the resources of their associated aircraft maintenance squadron, operations support squadron,  etc.    There  are  three  categories  of  mission  assessments  that  are  used  to  reflect  the unit’s  capabilities:    Core,  Named  Operations,  and  Top  Priority  Plans  (Level  4).    The  Core category  relates  to  the  unit’s  designed  mission,  while  the  Named  Operations  and  Top  Priority Plans categories relate to the assigned missions of the unit.  Capability  Readiness Assessments inform  both  Joint  and  Air  Force  organizations,  and  provide  commanders  readiness  information and status. 8.4.1.  Core METL.  A Core METL consists of the fundamental capabilities for which a unit was organized and designed.  AF/A3OR maintains a standardized list of Core METL by unit type.  Core METLs are part of the AFUTL document and can be accessed on the AF/A3OR SIPR  website.    All  measured  units  will  assess  a  Core  METL  (T-0).    Commanders  will consider  the  unit’s  assigned  resources  as  reported  in  the  Resource  Readiness  Assessment when assessing the METs for the Core METL (T-0).   8.4.1.1.  Augmenting  Core  METL.    Use  the  Core  METL  within  the  latest  approved AFUTL (T-0). 8.4.1.1.1.  Special cases: units with excess capabilities from the Core METL and units with  fewer  capabilities  than  the  Core  METL.    In  these  cases,  the  MAJCOM,  in coordination  with  the  MAJCOM/AFIMSC  FAM,  will  authorize  the  unit  to  add  or delete specific tasks and/or task performance standards to the unit’s Core METL  (T-0).    The  MAJCOM  Readiness  Office  will  keep  documentation  of  the  Core  METL modifications,  to  include  original  date  of  approval  and  coordination  with  the appropriate FAM (HAF, MAJCOM, or AFIMSC) (T-1). 8.4.1.2.  If the AFUTL does not contain a Core METL for a unit, then the unit will notify its  MAJCOM  Readiness  Office  (T-0).    The  MAJCOM  Readiness  Office  will  notify AF/A3OR, who will determine the appropriate FAM (HAF, MAJCOM, or AFIMSC) to develop a Core METL (T-0). 8.4.1.3.  If  a  unit  commander  believes  the  unit’s  AF  standard  Core  METL  should  be updated, the commander will contact  the Wing  Readiness POC to  notify the MAJCOM Readiness Office who will coordinate with AF/A3OR (T-0). 8.4.2.  Named  Operations  METL.    Named  Operations  are  designated  by  the  President, Secretary of Defense, and/or Joint Chiefs of Staff (e.g., Operation ENDURING FREEDOM and  Operation  NOBLE  EAGLE  (ONE)).    Measured  units  will  assess  a  Named  Operation  66 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 METL for a full or partial unit deployment (T-0).  However, units will only report against a Named  Operation(s)  if  5%  or  more  of  the  unit  is  preparing  to  deploy  or  is  deployed  (T-1).  Reporting is required no later than 120 calendar days prior to the deployment or upon receipt of an appropriate order (e.g., PTDO, DEPORD) (T-1).  Named Operation reporting continues until  redeployment  or  release  from  orders  for  the  assigned  mission  (T-1).    While  a  Named Operation normally requires a unit to deploy away from its home station, Named Operation requirements  can  also  apply  to  assigned  missions  executed  at  home  station  (e.g.,  ONE).  When reporting against a Named Operation, a commander will only assess resources organic to the unit, and the assessment will only consider those assets directly supporting the Named Operation (T-1).  For example, a unit might have 24 aircraft and 36 crews, but only 6 aircraft and 9 crews are supporting a Named Operation.  The commander’s assessment would be for the 6 aircraft and 9 crews, and their ability to  execute the Named Operation.  If a unit uses loaned equipment, aircraft, and/or personnel to complete a Named Operation, then the unit is meeting its Named Operation requirement.  However, any impact to the unit’s ability to meet its  full-spectrum  mission(s)  (i.e.,  the  situation  that  created  the  need  for  loaned  resources) should be addressed via the Core Mission Assessment.  If a unit has resources preparing for a specific  Named  Operation  in  addition  to  other  resources  already  deployed  for  the  same Named  Operation,  the  unit  will  assess  the  deployed  assets,  accompanied  by  commander’s remarks to show an assessment(s) of the resources preparing to deploy (T-1).  8.4.2.1.  Named Operation assessments will include a description of the level of effort the unit is providing in support of the Named Operation tasking (T-1).  Commanders should consider describing the deployment location, deployment duration, number of personnel and equipment deployed, and any special requirements associated with the deployment.   8.4.3.  Top Priority Plans METs.  Top Priority Plan assessments are only required for Level 4 plans, designated in the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan.  Any unit assigned or sourced to a Level 4 plan will assess their ability to provide capabilities tasked in the plan, and to execute the plan (T-0).  Reporting of the Top Priority Plan continues until released from the Level 4 plan (T-1).   8.4.3.1.  When  assessing  Top  Priority  Plans,  units  will  assess  deployed  assets  (or  those already  committed/engaged  at  home  station)  as  unavailable  (e.g.,  unit  personnel  and aircraft supporting ONE from home station would be unavailable for a Top Priority Plan mission assessment)  (T-1).   If a Top Priority Plan mission assessment is  degraded (i.e., “Q”  or  “N”)  due  in  part  or  in  full  to  deployed  assets,  then  commanders  will  clearly annotate  the  degradation  reason  in  the  Top  Priority  Plan  remark  (T-0).    The  remark allows personnel to  review the unit’s Core mission assessment to  understand its overall readiness picture.  Resources at exercises or training events will be counted as available (T-0). 8.4.3.2.  Top Priority Plans readiness reporting will be based on “Planning factors” only (T-1).    Per  CJCSM  3130.03,  Adaptive  Planning  and  Execution  (APEX)  Planning Formats and Guidance, contingency sourced forces (in Level 4 Plans) are specific forces identified by actual unit name and UIC by the Joint Force Providers, which are assisted by their Service components and parent Services that meet the planning requirement at a specified time.  There should be no expectation that the contingency sourced forces will be  the  actual  forces  sourced  for  execution,  since  the  forces  identified  are  based  on planning guidance and assumptions.  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 67 8.4.3.3.  In addition, if the Level 4 plan is sourced through “Preferred Force,” per CJCSM 3130.03,  the  preferred  force  identification  is  used  in  the  entire  planning  process  from strategic  guidance  through  plan  assessment.    Preferred  forces  are  specific  forces identified by the supported combatant commander in order to assess risk, sustainment and transportation planning, and continued employment.  Mission assessments will be based on “Planning factors” only. 8.4.4.  A  Named  Operation  or  Top  Priority  Plan  mission  assessment  will  not  necessarily correlate  with  a  unit’s  Core  mission  assessment  (reference  Table  8.1).    Commanders  must analyze  the  mission  orders,  or  OPLAN  tasking  requirements,  then  specify  the  METs  in  the unit’s Core METL that will be assessed as part of the Named Operation or Top Priority Plan METL  (T-0).    The  Wing  Readiness  POC  will  assist  units,  as  required  (T-3).    A  unit  can assess all of the METs in the Core METL or a portion of the METs in the Core METL as the Named  Operation  or  Top  Priority  Plan  METL.    More  information  regarding  METL development can be found in the AFUTL document. 8.4.4.1.  Table 8.1 shows how Core METs are associated with capabilities supporting the CCDR.  A MET can be assessed differently in each instance. Table 8.1.  Core, Named Op, and Top Priority Plan METL Correlation  MET 1 MET 2 MET 3 MET 4 MET 5 Core  Named Op  Top Priority X X X X X  X X  X X    X 8.5.  Capability  Readiness  Assessments.  Capability  Readiness  Assessments  will  be  based  on the "Yes," "Qualified Yes," or "No" definitions, but will also consider the mission as a whole to include  Resource  Readiness  Assessments.    As  such,  Capability  Readiness  Assessments  will reflect  the  commander’s  military  experience  and  judgment  on  all  the  tasks,  MET  assessments, and factors affecting the unit’s ability to meet mission requirements.  Comments will be written to allow for ease of understanding by all consumers of AF Readiness data (e.g., OSD, Joint Staff, Combatant Commands) (T-0). 8.5.1.  The  following  guidelines  will  be  used  to  ensure  consistent  Capability  Readiness Assessments:  8.5.1.1.  “Yes”  (Y/Green):    If  the  majority  (51  percent)  of  the  METs  are  assessed  as “Yes,”  and  the  remaining  METs  are  assessed  as  “Qualified  Yes,”  then  the  overall assessment should be “Yes” (T-0). 8.5.1.2.  “Qualified  Yes”  (Q/Yellow):    If  the  majority  (51  percent)  of  the  METs  are assessed  as  “Qualified  Yes,”  and  the  remaining  METs  are  assessed  as  “Yes,”  then  the overall Capability Readiness Assessment should be “Qualified Yes” (T-0). 8.5.1.3.  “No” (N/Red):   If  any of the METs are assessed as “No,” then the commander must  make  a  judgment  if  the  mission  objectives  can  still  be  accomplished.    If  the commander makes a subjective upgrade for an overall Capability Readiness Assessment to  other  than  “No,”  the  commander  will  clearly  explain  how  the  mission  will  be  68 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 accomplished despite the inability to accomplish the MET(s), and any mitigation actions taken (T-0).  8.5.2.  Commanders  will  assess  current  status,  and  a  projected  status  (include  forecasted change, date, and Mission Assessment levels) for each METL assessed (T-0). 8.5.3.  Remarks are mandatory  whenever a  "Qualified Yes" or "No"  assessment  is  used  (T-0).  Remarks  are  also  mandatory  when  a  “Yes”  assessment  is  made  when  the  unit’s  ART and/or Resource Readiness Assessment indicates degraded readiness due to lack of resources or training (T-0). 8.5.4.  The  "Yes”,  "Qualified  Yes",  and  "No"  guidelines  should  guide  the  Capability Readiness Assessment decision; however, they are not a substitute for commander judgment and experience.  8.6.  Preparing  Narrative  Comments.  Comments  are  a  critical  component  of  readiness assessments,  and  are  required  whenever  a  "Qualified  Yes"  or  "No"  assessment  is  used,  or  a "Yes" assessment is used when guidelines would indicate a "Qualified Yes" or "No." 8.6.1.  When  “Q”  or  “N”  assessments  are  made,  comments  for  tasks  will  be  formatted  to include:  Issue, Impact, Fix, and GWD (T-1).  In addition, if MAJCOMs/NAFs, etc. use the “Top Concerns” tab in DRRS follow this guidance for the comments (T-2): 8.6.1.1.  Issue  (Concern/Shortfall):    Provide  a  thorough  explanation  of  the  issue  using layman's terms.  If the issue is resource-centric (e.g., lack of equipment on-hand), include the  comment  date  and  provide    appropriate  details,  such  as  part  numbers,  NSNs, nomenclature,  quantity  authorized,  quantity  on-hand,  quantity  on-order,  and  expected delivery date.  8.6.1.2.  Impact:    Describe  the  mission  impact  using  layman’s  terms,  providing  a  risk assessment when appropriate. 8.6.1.3.  Fix (Mitigation/Solution, Way Ahead, Recommendation):  Identify actions being taken or assistance needed to improve the unit's readiness.  Identify previously requested assistance  and  remedial  actions  in  progress;  explain  unit,  wing,  or  MAJCOM/AFIMSC actions taken to resolve shortfalls.   8.6.1.4.  GWD:    Using  the  date  from  the  "Anticipated  Change"  section  of  the  task  or Mission Assessment as a reference, provide a realistic GWD for each comment. 8.6.2.  Use comments to provide supporting information concerning unit assessments. 8.6.3.  Comments  must  be  checked  and  verified  for  accuracy  each  time  a  unit  readiness assessment  is  approved—revise,  as  necessary,  to  maintain  validity.    Comments  should  be clear and concise, but not at the expense of the details needed.  They must contain a detailed functional  explanation  to  provide  details  needed  for  functional  management.    Remove comments that no longer apply. 8.6.3.1.  Each  comment  must  stand  on  its  own  content.    As  DRRS  is  dynamic  and comments  may  change  from  assessment  to  assessment,  do  not  refer  to  previous assessments.  Do not submit comments referencing other comments.     8.6.3.2.  To eliminate confusion by DRRS customers, abbreviations will not be used, and acronyms must be spelled out once in each comment.  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 69 8.6.3.3.  Provide  the  classification  for  each  comment,  and  ensure  every  paragraph  is marked. 8.7.  Direction  For  Units  With  A  Mission  Change.  When  a  unit  is  transitioning  to  another mission, the MAJCOM/AFIMSC FAM/Readiness Office will direct when the unit may load the new  Core  METL,  but  no  later  than  the  unit  being  removed  from  C-5  status  in  their  Resource assessment (T-0).  Core METL will be developed and coordinated in advance, if possible, by the POC listed in FAM POC listing in Functional Area Manager CoP and included in the AFUTL by AF/A3OR (T-0).  If a POC is not identified in the FAM POC listing, then AF/A3OR will assign a POC to develop the METL. 8.8.  Alignment.  Unit  commanders  will  provide  an  explanatory  remark,  under  Mission Assessment,  in  their  Capability  Readiness  Assessment  if  their  Core  mission  assessment  and overall C-Level rating do not align per Figure 8.1 (T-1).  Figure 8.1 will be used to determine when remarks are required in a Capability Readiness Assessments; it does not dictate mandatory ratings for Capability or Resource Readiness Assessments (T-1). Figure 8.1.  Alignment of Resource and Capability Assessment Ratings C-1 Y C-2 C-3 Q C-4 C-5 N 8.8.1.  The  commander  will  determine  if  the  unit  can  accomplish  the  Core  METL  with  the available resources (T-1).   8.8.1.1.  If the unit cannot accomplish the Core METL, the Capability assessment should be  “No”  and  the  commander  will  provide  detailed  remarks  explaining  why  the  unit cannot  accomplish  the  designed  mission—specifically  addressing  why  possessed resources are insufficient to accomplish the Core METL (T-1). 8.8.1.2.  If the unit can accomplish the CORE METL, the commander will decide if the unit is capable of executing the METL to the level-of-capability the unit is organized to provide (T-1).  8.8.1.2.1.  If  the  unit  can  provide  the  full  organized  capability,  the  Capability assessment should be “Yes.” 8.8.1.2.2.  If the unit cannot  provide the full organized capability, but  it can provide the  majority  of  the  organized  capability,  “Qualified  Yes”  should  be  reported explaining  the  impact  of  resource  shortfalls.    Commanders  will  specifically  address how  the  resource  shortfalls  impact  the  unit’s  Capability  assessment  and  address actions  that  are  underway  to  correct  the  shortfalls  or  actions  that  are  required  to resolve shortfalls (T-1).  70 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 Chapter 9 METL GUIDANCE 9.1.  NAF and MAJCOM Capability Readiness Assessments. 9.1.1.  MAJCOMs and NAFs (with support from AFIMSC, as applicable) will assess a Core METL that covers their organize, train, and equip (OT&E) role (T-0). 9.1.2.  AF Component Headquarters and/or AF Forces (AFFOR) assigned as the Component MAJCOM  or  Component  Numbered  AF  (C-MAJCOMs  and  C-NAFs)  will  develop  a  Core METL, derived from CCMD Joint Mission Essential Task Lists (JMETLs), that includes the task(s)  the  Air  Force  provides  in  support  of  the  CCMD  JMETL  (T-0).    Components  will conduct  a  mission  analysis  of  the  capabilities  the  Air  Force  provides  to  the  CCMD  and develop/report a mission assessment for Named Operation(s) and Top Priority Plan(s) (T-0).  A  component  may  use  all  or  a  portion  of  the  tasks  in  the  Core  METL  as  a  basis  for  the Named  Operation(s)  or  Top  Priority  Plan(s)  mission  assessments.    Task(s)  conditions  and standards  should  be  tailored  to  the  specific  Named  Operation  or  Top  Priority  Plan.    These METLs  generally  consist  of  tasks  at  the  Operational  or  Strategic  Theater  level,  but  can include tasks at other levels if necessary. 9.1.3.  The  AFUTL  Core  METL  document  (on  AF/A3OR  SIPR  website)  and  CJCSM 3500.03, Joint Training Manual for the Armed Forces of the United States, contain guidance which  can  be  applied  to  AF  component  and/or  AFFOR,  NAF,  and  MAJCOM  METL building. 9.2.  Installation METL. 9.2.1.  The Installation METL contains five METs:  Airfield Operations; Munitions Supply, Storage,  and  Distribution;  Petroleum,  Oil,  and  Lubricants  (POL);  Provide  Contingency Billeting;  and  Range  Operations.    Installations  must  submit  a  report  annually  or  within  72 hours of a change as outlined below: 9.2.1.1.  A  change  in  status  resulting  in  a  “No”  assessment  for  any  of  the  installation’s METs. 9.2.1.2.  New encroachment concerns or environmental impacts. 9.2.1.3.  Natural disasters affecting installation operations. 9.2.1.4.  Legislative changes impacting training capability.  9.2.2.  Do not assess tasks an installation does not perform.  In these cases, the installation’s designated  agent  (see  Paragraph    9.2.3)  will  coordinate  with  the  MAJCOM  Readiness Office  for  approval  to  delete  the  non-applicable  task.    Once  approval  is  received,  the installation will invalidate the non-applicable task via Build METL (T-0). 9.2.3.  Wing commanders will name the Mission Support Group commander, Civil Engineer Squadron  commander,  or  the  organization  that  supports  the  installation  and  facilities  as  the designated  agent  to  assess  the  installation  mission  under  the  installation’s  UIC  (i.e.,  do  not use the host wing’s UIC) registered in DRRS, listed in the AF Tables under the Installation UIC tab (T-1).  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 71 9.2.3.1.  Commanders  will  assess  the  ability  of  the  installation  to  accomplish  assigned tasks to standard(s) under specified conditions as documented in the AFUTL (T-0).  The AFUTL  can be accessed on the AF/A3OR SIPR website.  These assessments should be informed and  military experience/judgment. performance  measures, by resource availability, 9.2.4.  Installations  with  organizations  assigned  to  multiple  MAJCOMs:    Each  organization will  assess  the  capabilities  they  provide  (T-1).    The  lead  organization  (i.e.,  base  host)  with assistance from AFIMSC will make an overall assessment for the base (T-1). 9.2.5.  For  Joint  Bases,  AF  wings/groups  that  are  not  the  lead  Service  will  only  assess  the capabilities they provide (T-1).  Joint Bases that are hosted by the Air Force will be assessed by the agent as appointed by the Wing Commander (see Paragraph  9.2.3) (T-1). 9.3.  METL  Development.  See  the  AFUTL  for  additional  information  about  MET/METL development.  The AFUTL can be accessed on the AF/A3OR SIPR website.  The METL will be developed  and  coordinated  in  advance,  if  possible,  by  the  POC  listed  in  FAM  POC  listing  in Functional Area Manager CoP and included in the AFUTL by AF/A3OR (T-0).  If a POC is not identified  in  the  FAM  POC  listing,  then  AF/A3OR  will  assign  a  POC  to  develop  the  METL.  POCs are usually the FAM from the MAJCOM or AFIMSC, designated as the lead command or the  appropriate  HAF  FAM.    For  multifunctional  units  (e.g.,  OSS,  LRS),  the  FAM  for  the functional  area with  the preponderance of the unit mission, to  include equipment,  will serve as the OPR.  The other FAMs for multifunctional units will serve as OCRs. JOHN W.

organizations.  Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS)— A system used to manage equipment across the Air Force. Allowance  Standard  (AS)—An  equipment  allowance  document that  prescribes  basic allowances for organizational equipment, and provides the control to develop, revise, or change equipment authorization inventory data.  Assigned  Aircraft—Aircraft  allocated  to  a  unit  by  serial  number  on  an  assignment  order according to aerospace vehicle distribution directives.  Assigned  Crews—The number of personnel who have signed into the measured unit, and who are or who will become part of a primary duty crew.  The squadron commander and operations officer can be counted as assigned for C-Level reporting.  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 81 Assigned  Personnel—All  US  military,  DoD  civilian,  and  Foreign  National  personnel  are considered available to a unit regardless of AFSC, skill level or grade as long as they are not in excess to the requirements of AFSC, skill level, grade, or authorized personnel restrictions.  Authorized  Personnel—Personnel  authorized  to  a  measured  unit  based  on  the  funded authorizations in MPES.  Available  Equipment—Equipment  availability  depends  on  unit  mission  according  to  the following: Available  Equipment  1—Units with  a  generation mission may  count  possessed equipment  on temporary  deployment  as  available  if  the  equipment  can  be  returned  to  the  measured  unit  and prepared for employment within the unit's response time. Available  Equipment  2—Units  with  a  mobility  mission  may  count  possessed  equipment  as available regardless of location if it can be configured and packaged for deployment within the unit's response time. Authoritative  Data  Source  (ADS)—Databases  that  provide  unit  resource  (personnel  and equipment) authorizations, personnel assignment and duty status data, equipment possession and condition data, and training data for the unit.  Available  Personnel—Personnel  who  can  be  physically  present  and  ready  to  accomplish  the mission(s)  within  the  unit  response  time.    Additionally,  the  unit  commander  determines availability if DAV codes apply, reference AFI 10-403, Deployment Planning.  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC)—The status of a crew who has satisfactorily completed Initial Qualification Training (IQT) prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions, but does not maintain CMR status.  Category  Levels  (C-Levels)—A  five-point  scale  showing  the  degree  to  which  a  unit  meets standards within the four measured areas.  Combat  Air  Forces  (CAF)—Air  Force  units  designed  to  and  usually  tasked  to  employ ordinance  on  targets.    These  units  include:  Fighter,  Bomber,  Missile  (ICBM),  and  Special Operations.    Commands  that  are  members  of  the  CAF  are  ACC,  AETC,  AFGSC,  AFRC, AFSOC, AFSPC, ANG, PACAF, and USAFE.  Combat  Essential  Equipment—One  of  two  major  categories  of  equipment  in  Resource assessments.  It includes the primary weapon systems or service-designated items of equipment assigned to a unit to undertake its specified wartime mission.  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR)—The  status  of  a  crewmember,  who  has  satisfactorily completed Mission Qualification Training (MQT), prescribed to be fully qualified to perform the basic unit operational missions, and maintains qualification and proficiency in these missions.  Combat  Service  Support  Units—Forces  whose  primary  mission  is  to  provide  essential capabilities,  functions,  activities,  and  tasks  necessary  to  sustain  all  elements  of  combat  and combat support forces at all levels of war.  Includes, but not limited to, Mission Support, Force Support, Contracting, Wing Staff Agencies, Comptroller, and select FOAs providing reach back support (e.g., AF Flight Standards Agency (AFFSA) and AF Operations Group (AFOG)). Combat Support Units—Forces whose primary mission is to provide combat support to combat forces, and is a part or prepared to become a part of a theater, command, or task force, formed  82 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 for  combat  operations  (e.g.,  munitions,  maintenance,  intelligence,  weather,  medical,  and communications).    Includes,  but  not  limited  to,  Airlift,  Refueling,  Aircraft  Maintenance, Munitions,  Security  Forces,  Rescue  (Aviation),  Numbered  AF,  Air  Operations,  Air  Control, Weather,  Space  (Operations,  Communications,  Reconnaissance,  etc.),  Cyberspace  Operations (DoD Information Network (DoDIN) Operations), Communications, Logistics Readiness, Aerial Port,  Aerospace  Evacuation,  RED  HORSE,  Prime  BEEF  (includes  engineer,  fire  emergency services  (FES),  EOD,  and  Civil  Engineering  (CE)  emergency  management  personnel), Intelligence, Medical, and any FOA that has consolidated all of their resources and deploys them into theater (e.g., AF Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI)).  Combat  Units—Forces  expected  to  fire  weapons,  conduct  reconnaissance,  or  engage  in  other activities  directly  related  to  combat  operations.    Includes,  but  not  limited  to,  Fighter,  Bomber, Reconnaissance, Special Tactics, Rescue (Guardian Angel), Special Ops, Missile, and Airborne Command and Control squadrons, regardless of MAJCOM.  Commander’s Assessment—Unit commander’s evaluation of data (obtained through Resource assessment and/or information available to the commander outside the measurement system that impacts  the  unit's  ability  to  undertake  the  designed  mission)  and  judgment  on  which  C-Level best represents the actual readiness of the unit.  Commanders are only authorized to assess down.  Contingency  Sourced  Forces—Per  CJCSM  3130.03,  specific  forces  in  Level  IV  plans identified  by  actual  name  and  UIC  by  the  Joint  Force  Providers,  assisted  by  their  Service Component and parent Service, that meet the planning requirement at a specified point in time.  These  units  may  be  included  in  the  OPLAN's  Time  Phased  Force  Deployment  Data  (TPFDD).  Because  these  forces  are  identified  based  on  planning  assumptions/guidance  provided  for  the sourcing  effort,  there  should  be  little  expectation  that  forces  sourced  via  contingency  sourcing will be the actual forces sourced during execution sourcing. Control  Air  Force  Specialty  Code  (CAFSC)—Used  as  a  management  tool  to  make  Airman assignments,  to  assist  in  determining  training  requirements,  and  to  consider  individuals  for promotion.  Critical Air Force Specialty Code—An AFSC identified as essential to the launch, recovery, or turnaround  of  a  unit's  weapon  system  or  the  direct  accomplishment  of  the  unit's  specified wartime mission.  Critical Personnel—Officers who have a critical Air Force specialty code (AFSC) as their duty or primary AFSC, and Enlisted who have a critical AFSC as their control, primary, or secondary AFSC.  Deploy/Deployment—To relocate a unit, or an element thereof, to a desired area of operations or  to  a  staging  area.    Deployment  will  be  accomplished  with  all  required  personnel  and equipment.    Deployment  begins  when  the  first  aircraft,  personnel,  or  item  of  equipment  leaves the home base.  The force is deployed when the last component of the unit has arrived.  Deployed  (for  Resource  Assessment)—Resources  not  currently  at  home  station  due  to execution of a properly authorized movement order or Joint deployment order.  Additionally, not recallable by a commander’s Leave or TDY recall message.  Normally, deployment in support of training  exercises  or  Joint  exercises  would  not  preclude  recall  or  release  of  forces  by  the exercising commander.   AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 83 Detachment—1) A part of a unit separated from its main organization for duty elsewhere and 2) A temporary military unit formed from other units or parts of units.  Element—Nomenclature used to account for manpower authorizations, and to identify Air Force personnel  on  duty  with  agencies  outside  the  Air  Force.    Although  not  a  unit  for  organizational purposes, an element may function as a unit if so designated, and a commissioned officer eligible to command either assumes command or is appointed on orders as commander.  Employment—Involves  the  tactical  use  of  aircraft  in  a  desired  area  of  operation.    In  airlift operations, it is the movement of forces into or within a combat zone or objective area, usually in the assault phase.  It is the strategic, operational, or tactical use of forces and materiel in an area or theater of operations.  Equipment—All non-expendable items needed to outfit or equip an individual or organization, with regards to logistics. Equipment and Supplies On-hand—Equipment that is possessed by the unit.  When measured in the Equipment and Supplies On-hand measured resource area and equipment condition is not measured  for  that  asset,  it  must  be  operationally  ready  to  deploy/employ  for  the  unit  assigned mission.  Equipment Condition—The status of an equipment item in the possession of an operating unit that  indicates  it  is  capable  of  fulfilling  its  intended  mission  and  in  a  system  configuration  that offers a high assurance of an effective, reliable, and safe performance.  Full Mission Capable—Material condition of an aircraft or training device indicating that it can perform all of its missions.  Full  Spectrum  Mission—A  unit’s  home-station  tasks  combined,  simultaneously,  with mobility/deployed tasks from assigned missions.  Functional  Area  Manager  (FAM)—An  individual  responsible  for  the  management  and planning of all personnel and equipment within a specific functional area to support wartime and peacetime contingencies.  Get  Well  Date  (GWD)—The  date  a  measured  resource  area  or  overall  C-Level  reaches  a  “2” and/or “1”.  In most Joint forums, a C-Level of “1” or “2” is considered “ready”.  In-garrison  Generation—Performing  all  mission  functions  (employment)  from  the  Home location, including aircraft generation and launch, and security forces units. Does not include the OPERATIONS PLAN 8010-FY mission.  In-place Readiness  Spares  Package (IRSP)—Spares and repair parts intended for use as base support  for  units  that  plan  to  operate  in-garrison  during  wartime  considering  the  available maintenance  capability.    IRSP  represents  the  difference  between  the  primary  operating  stock levels expected to be available to the unit in wartime, and its total wartime requirement.  Just-In-Time  Training  (JIT  Training)—A  training  frequency  created  to  identify  highly perishable, deployment-centric tasks warranting review and refresher training immediately prior to deployment.  Measured  Units—  Units  with  a  Unit  Descriptor  Code  (UDC)  of  combat,  combat  support,  or combat  service  support  within  the  PAS  code  table,  and  that  fulfill  the  AFI  38-101,  Air  Force Organization,  description  of  a  unit  are  considered  measured  units.    Measured  units  report  84 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 readiness  assessments  in  DRRS  and  are  required  to  have  a  current  Designed  Operational Capability (DOC) Statement in DRRS, on the DOC Statement tab within the Current Unit Status (CUS) page. Mission  Qualification  Training  (MQT)—Training  required  to  achieve  a  basic  level  of competence in a unit’s primary tasked mission; a prerequisite for CMR and BMC status.  Mission Ready and Available (MRA) Aircraft—Aircraft that have operational full system list (FSL)  or  basic  system  list  (BSL)  items  for  the  stated  mission,  and  are  available  within  the response  time.    The  aircraft  are  configured  with  required  suspension  equipment,  weapons  are uploaded, servicing is completed, and pre-flights done.  The major command determines the list to be used, items required, and the aircraft configuration.  Mission  Ready  and  Available  Crews—Primary  duty  crews  who  are  mission  ready,  and available  to  undertake  the  unit's  specified  wartime  tasking.    The  unit  commander  determines crew availability.  Mission  Ready  and  Available  Equipment—Equipment  that  is  available,  and  in  condition  to perform the functions it was designed for, within the response time.  Mission Set—A grouping of missions (EXAMPLE: All missions an organization is organized or designed; chemical biological defense; conventional, nuclear; engagement, peace-keeping/peace-making).  Mobility Air Forces (MAF)—Air components and Service components that are assigned and/or routinely  exercise  command  authority  over  mobility  operations.    Air  mobility  is  the  rapid movement  of  personnel,  materiel,  and  forces  to  and  from,  or  within,  a  theater  by  air.    The  air mobility network combines airlift, air refueling, aeromedical evacuation, and air mobility support assets, processes, and procedures to support the transport of personnel and materiel. Mobility Mission—A wartime mission the measured unit will normally mobilize and deploy to another area of operation prior to employment.  Mobility  Readiness  Spares  Package  (MRSP)—An  air  transportable  package  of  war  reserve materiel  spares,  repair  parts,  and  related  maintenance  supplies  required  to  support  planned wartime or contingency operations of a weapon or support system for a specified period of time pending  re-supply.    MRSP  may  support  aircraft,  vehicles,  communications  systems,  and  other systems.  Notional  Task—The  condition  of  being  prepared  to  execute  a  mission  set  against  a  planned requirement that is not tasked, but representative of a probable task in contingency or deliberate planning actions.  Units sourced to the Air Force War and Mobilization Plan (AF WMP) against apportioned  requirements,  which  are  not  currently  tasked  to  any  OPLAN,  CONPLAN,  or OPERATIONS  PLAN  8010-FY,  are  notionally  tasked  to  be  able  to  deliver  their  Designed Operational  Capability  within  their  response  time  if  allocated  to  a  crisis  or  sourced  to  a  Time Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD).  Operational Control (OPCON)—Transferable command authority exercised by commanders at any  echelon  at  or  below  the  level  of  combatant  command.    Operational  control  is  inherent  in Combatant  Command  (command  authority)  and  is  the  authority  to  perform  functions  of command  over  subordinate  forces  involving  organizing  and  employing  commands  and  forces,  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 85 assigning  tasks,  designating  objectives,  and  giving  authoritative  direction  necessary  to accomplish the mission.  Operating  Location  (OL)—Part  of  a  unit  geographically  separated  from  its  parent  unit.    It  is used  to  account  for  personnel  by  location.    Personnel  remain  assigned  to  the  parent  unit  for command supervision and other services provided by a detachment are not needed. An OL has none of the administrative attributes of a unit.  Operation Plan (OPLAN)—A plan for a single or series of connected operations to be carried out  simultaneously  or  in  succession.    It  is  usually  based  upon  stated  assumptions  and  is  in  the form of a directive employed by higher authority to permit subordinate commanders to prepare supporting  plans  and  orders.    The  designation  “plan”  is  usually  used  instead  of  “order”  in preparing  for  operations  well  in  advance.    An  Operation  Plan  may  be  put  into  effect  at  a prescribed  time,  or  on  signal,  and  then  becomes  an  Operation  Order.    Plans  are  prepared  by Combatant Commanders in response to requirements established by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and by commanders of subordinate commands in response to requirements tasked by the establishing  unified  commander.    OPLANs  are  prepared  in  either  complete  forma,  or  as  a concept plan (CONPLAN).  Organic Equipment—Equipment authorized, required, and under the direct control of the unit.  Other—  Any  organization  not  designated  as  Combat,  Combat  Support,  or  Combat  Service Support.  Overhead  Crew—A person or a  group of people assigned or attached to the organization in  a status  other  than  primary  duty  crew  (e.g.,  wing  training  officers,  safety  officers,  maintenance officers,  missile  squadron  commanders)  who  maintain  mission  ready  status.    Overhead crewmembers WILL NOT be counted in the Personnel or Training C-Level calculations.  Overall  C-Level—Commanders  of  measured  units  and  Operations  Officers  who  maintain mission ready status may be counted in the Personnel and Training C-Level calculations.  Possessed  Aircraft—Given  aircraft  that  is  the  actual  responsibility  of  a  measured  unit  for operational  use.    Aircraft  temporarily  absent  but  remaining  under  the  operational  control (OPCON)  of  the  measured  unit  are  considered  possessed  aircraft.    This  includes  aircraft possessed  by  a  unit’s  supporting  maintenance  facilities  until  the  aircraft  are  lost  from  the  unit, according to AFI 21-103, Equipment Inventory, Status and Utilization Reporting.  Possessed  Equipment—Given  equipment  that  is  the  actual  responsibility  of  a  measured  unit, according to applicable supply regulations for operational use.  Preferred Force Sourcing — Per CJCSM 3130.03, the preferred force identification is used in the  entire  planning  process  from  strategic  guidance  through  plan  assessment.    Preferred  forces are specific forces assigned/allocated that are identified by the supported combatant commander in order to continue employment, sustainment and transportation planning and assess risk.  These forces  are  planning  assumptions  only,  are  not  considered  sourced  units  and  may  not  be contingency or execution sourced. Primary Air Force Specialty Code—The awarded AFSC an Airman is most highly qualified to perform duty.   86 AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 Primary  Aircraft  Authorization—Aircraft  authorized  to  a  unit  for  performance  of  its operational  mission.    The  primary  authorization  forms  the  basis  for  the  allocation  of  operating resources to include manpower, support equipment, and flying hour funds. Primary Mission—The wartime mission that is most resource demanding.  The only exception is  when  a  unit  has  a  less  resource  demanding  mission  of  higher  priority,  such  as  a  specific OPLAN.  Registered Units—Units that have the potential to support, by deployment or otherwise, a CJCS or  CCMD-directed  contingency  plan,  Single  Integrated  Operations  Plan,  or  contingency operation.  Reporting  Units—Units  with  a  Unit  Descriptor  Code  (UDC)  of  combat,  combat  support,  or combat service support required to report on their resources.  Special  Mission  Capability—An  enhancement  to  mission  accomplishment.    It  provides opportunities  for  accomplishment  in  various  situational  scenarios,  adds  tactical  flexibility  to mission  accomplishment,  and  normally  requires  additional training  and/or  specialized equipment.  Subarea—A class of equipment or supply within a resource major category of equipment.  The major categories are combat essential equipment, and support equipment and supplies.  Subordinate  Mission—Missions  that  stand  by  themselves  as  directed  sub-elements  within  the primary mission.  Subordinate missions are not secondary missions, but integral elements of the primary mission.  Supplies—All  material  and  items  used  in  the  equipment,  support  and  maintenance  of  military forces, with regards to logistics. Support  Equipment—All  equipment  required  to  perform  the  support  function  except  those integral to the mission equipment.  Does not include any equipment required to perform mission operation functions (AFDD 1.2, Air Force Glossary).  Suspension  Equipment—All  aircraft  devices,  such  as  racks,  adapters,  missile  launchers,  and pylons, used for carriage, employment and jettison of aircraft stores.  Tasked—Assignment to perform a specific mission or task allotted by higher component.  Total Personnel—The total number of personnel authorized or required by the measured unit.  Unit Descriptor Code (UDC)—A one character, alphanumeric code indicating the component, general  status,  and  primary  mission  for  which  the  organization  was  established;  stored  in  the Joint database as a 3 character code.  Unit  Identification  Code  (UIC)—A six-character, alpha-numeric code that uniquely identifies each Active, Reserve, and National Guard unit of the Armed Forces.  Unit  Type  Code  (UTC)—A  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  developed  and  assigned  code,  consisting  of five  characters  that  uniquely  identify  a  "like-type”  unit,  or  units  with  common  distinguishing characteristics.  The first character is established IAW CJCSM 3150.02B. War  and  Mobilization  Plan  (WMP)—Consists  of  five  volumes,  and  is  the  Air  Force‘s supporting  document  to  the  Joint  Strategic  Capabilities  Plan.    The  five WMP  volumes  provide the  Air  Staff,  Air  Force  planners,  and  Air  Force  commanders  with  current  policies,  planning  AFI10-201  3 MARCH 2016 87 factors,  and  CJCS  apportioned  forces  for  conducting  and  supporting  operations.    The  WMP establishes  requirements  for  developing  mobilization  and  planning  programs  to  support  and sustain  contingency  operations  of  the  programmed  forces.    It  encompasses  all  basic  functions necessary to match facilities, personnel, and materiel resources with planned wartime activity. War  Reserve  Materiel  (WRM)—Material  required,  in  addition  to  mobility  equipment, Readiness  Spares  Package  (RSP),  and  primary  operating  stocks  needed  to  support  wartime activities  reflected  in  the  Air  Force  War  and  Mobilization  Plan  until  the  industrial  base  has generated sufficient deliveries to equal planned wartime consumption.  Wartime Mission—A task or group of tasks assigned to a unit in an approved Operations Plan and expected to be executed during some level of armed conflict.  Wartime Resources—Personnel, equipment, and organic supply assets required to accomplish a unit’s wartime mission.
