The Noise Control Act of 1972 established a national policy to promote an environment for  all  Americans  free  from  noise  that  jeopardizes  their  health  and  welfare.  The  Act’s regulatory  authority  is  limited  to  the  manufacture,  labeling  and  importation  of  “products”  to ensure  they  meet  noise  emission  standards;  however,  the  act  specifically  excludes  aircraft, aircraft  engines,  military  weapons  or  equipment  designed  for  combat  from  the  definition  of “product.”  Despite this  exclusion, the Air  Force is  still required to  assess noise impacts under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 United States Code [USC] 4321 et seq.) and to comply with other laws such as the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 USC 1531 et seq.), and the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 USC § 300101 et seq.). 1.2.  A  general  definition  of  noise  is  unwanted  sound  and  it  is  up  to  the  individual  to determine whether they consider the sounds they are hearing as “noise.  ”  It also means that the issue of noise is  very  subjective,  and is  typically  influenced by  an individual’s experiences and  sensitivity.    Both  terms,  noise  and  sound,  are  used  in  this  instruction  depending  on  the context of the discussion.  The Air Force Noise Program is focused on noise from the operation of  aircraft,  small  arms,  tanks,  guns,  artillery,  missiles,  bombs,  rockets,  mortars,  and  explosives that  may  affect  people,  animals  (domestic  or  wild),  or  structures  on  or  in  areas  within  close proximity of a military installation, military test and training ranges, and within the SUA/ASU.  To  distinguish  it  from  “occupational  or  workplace  noise,  which  is  falls  under  the  Air  Force Aerospace  Medicine  program,  the  term  “environmental”  or  “community”  noise  is  used.”    The reader may also see the term “operational noise” associated with the Army’s noise program.  For purposes of the Air Force Noise Program the terms environmental, community, and operational noise are considered synonymous. 1.3.  Aircraft overflights, weapon system operations, or munition use have the potential to produce sound levels that may cause annoyance, speech interference, sleep disturbance, or damage  to  structures  (i.e.,  broken  windows).    The  public  typically  registers  their  noise concerns/issues  by  filing  complaints.  If  the  public  is  not  satisfied  with  the  Air  Force  or installation  response,  noise  complaints  can  quickly  escalate  into  political  interest  or  pressure  if members of the public contact their elected officials or Congressman.  Threats of litigation may arise,  or  if  there  is  perceived  physical  damage  to  property  there  may  be  damage  claims.    To minimize  possible  impacts  to  the  Air  Force  mission  or  tort  claims,  and  in  compliance  with Department of Defense (DoD) policy and directives, Commanders need to fully understand and actively manage the installation complex’s noise environment. 1.4.  This  instruction  provides  direction  and  policies  and  roles  and  responsibilities  for implementing  the  Air  Force  Noise  Program.  It also directs which models are to be used for the various noise sources and identifies primary and supplemental noise metrics.  The instruction also  provides  guidance  on  handling  noise-related  complaints  and  inquiries,  educating  airmen, and  communicating  with  the  public.    This  instruction  does  not  address  occupational  noise exposure in the workplace, underwater sound, or other transportation related noise sources. 6 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 CHAPTER 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Purpose.  The Air Force Noise Program will: 3.1.1.  Ensure  the  availability  of  computer  models  to  predict  present  and  future  noise environment,  investigate  specific  noise  concerns  in  support  of  Air  Force  planning  and encroachment  programs  and  support  Congressional  inquiries  and  questions  from  senior leadership. 3.1.2.  Ensure  appropriate  management  of  aircraft/weapon  system  noise  data,  computer model  operational  data  input  files,  and  computer  model  output  files  to  ensure  they  are available when needed and reflect current operations. 3.1.3.  Establish  the  primary  and  supplemental  metrics  to  be  used  in  support  of  the  AICUZ program and for analysis of noise impacts. 3.1.4.  Standardize the methodology for identifying, analyzing, and describing impacts from military test and training generated noise and mitigation options.  3.1.5.  Enhance  installation  personnel  and  Air  Force  leadership’s  understanding  of  the impacts  associated  with  noise  and  vibration  from  military  operations  in  order  to  better mitigate noise and facilitate public outreach and engagement. 3.1.6.  Develop  a  comprehensive  noise  complaint/inquiry  management  methodology  as  a means  to  improve  communication,  dialogue  and  relationships  with  the  surrounding communities  and  identify  trends  and    issues  with  the  potential  to  impact  future  beddowns and/or  realignments.  3.1.7.  Identify  and  advocate  for  noise  related  research/studies  to  support  environmental analysis  of  noise  impacts  in  compliance  with  42  USC  §4321  et  seq.  and  Section  7 consultations under 16 USC §§ 1531 et seq and Section 106 under 36 CFR Part 800. 3.2.  Computer Models.  The Air Force and its contractors use the most current versions of the noise  models  described  below  for  predicting  noise  in  the  various  testing  and  training environments.  More  details  about  these  models,  their  use  and  the  type  of  operational  data required for each model can be found in Attachment 2. 3.2.1.  The DoD version of NOISEMAP suite of programs (BASEOPS/NOISEMAP, AAM, and  NMPLOT)  is  used  to  predict  noise  for  exposure  from  all  flight  activity,  engine  run operations  from  aircraft  operations  in  the  military  airfield  environment  for  the  AICUZ program  and environmental analysis in  United States and its territories. The use of non-Air Force  versions  of  these  models  requires  prior  approval  from  AFCEC/CPP.    Overseas locations  can  use  NOISEMAP  for  environmental  analysis;  however,  the  noise  contours  are for internal Air Force use only.  AICUZ noise contours developed for overseas installations should  be  limited  to  the  land  area  within  the  installation  boundary.    Before  generating  any noise contours for an overseas location, consult HQ PACAF and HQ USAFE for direction.  3.2.2.  AFCEC/CPP,  in  coordination  with  711  HPW/  RHCB,  maintains  and  controls NOISEMAP,  MR_NMAP3,  and  BOOMAP  (T-1).    The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space Administration  (NASA)  maintains  and  controls  the  AAM  model  within  the  NOISEMAP AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 19 suite  of  models.   The  US  Army  Engineer  Research  and  Development  Center (EDRC)/CEERD-CN-N,  Champaign,  Illinois  maintains  and  controls  BNOISE  and SARNAM. 3.2.3.  AEDT  or  the  most  current  FAA-approved  noise  model  is  used  for  preparing  Noise Exposure  Maps  for  airports  that  participate  in  the  FAA’s  Part  150  program  (14  CFR  Part 150)  and  for  environmental  analysis  of  noise  impacts  for  actions  involving  Air  National Guard  installations  at  civilian  airports  and  for  Air  Reserve  Stations  located  at  civilian airports. 3.2.4.  Military Operating Area and Range NOISEMAP (MR_NMAP) is used for predicting noise  exposure  from  aircraft  operations  in  Special  Use  Airspace  and  Airspace  for  Special Use, and air-to-ground ranges. 3.2.5.  PCBOOM4 is  used for predicting  carpet  and focus sonic boom  footprints created by supersonic flight in Special Use Airspace and Airspace for Special Use.   3.2.6.  BOOMAP  is  used  for  analysis  of  the  cumulative  sonic  boom  environment  for  air combat maneuvering that includes supersonic flight. 3.2.7.  Air Gunnery model is used for predicting noise levels from airborne weapons use. 3.2.8.  Blast  Noise  (BNOISE2)  is  used  to  predict  noise  generated  by  large  caliber  weapons (20 millimeter and above) and explosives. 3.2.9.  Small  Arms  Range  Noise  Assessment  Model  (SARNAM)  is  used  to  predict  noise levels generated from small arms (.50 caliber and below) ranges. 3.2.10.  In  cases  where  construction  noise  is  analyzed,  the  2006  Federal  Highway Administration Construction Noise Handbook should be used as a guide. 3.3.  Noise  Model  Data  Management.  The  computer  models  require  several  types  of  data including  weather  data,  terrain  and  elevation  data,  location  specific  operational  data,  and  data (NOISEFILE)  derived  from  aircraft  overflight  noise  measurements,  weapon  systems,  or explosive sound levels.  The weather, terrain, and elevation data come from existing authoritative sources, while the location specific operational data for aircraft comes from pilot interviews, Air Traffic  Control,  and  maintenance  personnel.    For  Air  Force  led  Joint  Bases  with  an  Army supported component, data for small arms range and other ranges comes from the Range Facility Management Support System (RFMSS).  Operational data for Army helicopters comes from the airfield  managers.    See  the  Operational  Data  Collection  Handbook  in  the  Noise  Toolbox  on AFCEC/CPP’s :https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home.

To ensure the installation always has a set of noise contours and associated operational data  representing  current  flying,  testing  and  training  operations  available  for  purposes  of planning readiness, the following data management guidelines apply to the input data and the model output data files. 3.3.1.1.  All  final  noise  BASEOPS  input  and  NMPLOT  output  files,  including  all supporting  data  (i.e.,  Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  background  data,  digital elevation,  topography,  impedance,  and  operations  calculation  files)  are  sent  to AFCEC/CPP for database entry and archiving. 20 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 3.3.1.2.  All  information  used  during  the  noise  modeling  process  is  included  in  the NMODD).  This includes: 3.3.1.2.1.  Detailed notes from operational data collection efforts.  3.3.1.2.2.  Spreadsheets  used  for  documenting  and  calculating  daily  activity  with  all cells visible.  Hyperlinks  should be avoided to  ensure the data is  clearly understood by the next user.  3.3.1.2.3.  The  operational  data  (e.g.,  aircraft  configurations/flight  paths/firing points/target  locations/weapons  use,  amount  of  ammunition  used)  used  by  the respective  noise  model,  and  details  of  all  assumptions  made  during  the  modeling process.  3.3.1.2.4.  Flight profile maps for all permanently assigned aircraft and a flight profile operations summary as generated through the BASEOPS program.  3.3.1.3.  The  NMODD  is  retained  by  the  installation  noise  program  lead,  and  an electronic  copy    provided  to  AFCEC/CPP  for  archiving  in  accordance  with  paragraph 3.3.1.1.  (T-1).  3.3.2.  The  most  current  noise  model  data  available  from  AFCEC/CPP  or  the  FAA  (for civilian airports) will be the basis for data review and revalidation or subsequent modeling.   3.3.3.  The NMODD’s are reviewed to ensure cumulative effects are accounted. 3.3.3.1.  The  NMODD  used  to  generate  installation  Day  Night  Average  Sound  Level (DNL)/Community  Noise  Equivalent  Level  (CNEL)  contours  will  be  reviewed  and validated  biannually,  with  a  complete  collection  of  current  operational  data  conducted every  5  years  to  ensure  the  NMODD  and  the  noise  contours  reflect  current  mission operations.  (T-1).  An environmental analysis for proposed changes to flight operations or  testing  and  training  activities  scheduled  to  be  done  prior  to  the  biannual  review  and validation, can serve as the biannual validation.   3.3.3.2.  The operational data portion of the NMODD’s will be certified as current by the Operations  Squadron  Commander,  and  commander  of  tenant  units  that  conduct  testing and training activities if appropriate.  (T-1).  At Air Force led Joint Bases with an Army supported  component,  the  Chief  of  the  Range  Control  Office  will  validate  Army  range use and RFMSS data (T-1). 3.3.3.3.  NOISEFILE is the standard noise emissions database associated with each noise model.    Changes  to  NOISEFILE  data  are  controlled  by  711  HPW/RHCB.    Noise emission data for the NOISEFILE database for high performance military jet aircraft will be  collected  in  accordance  with  the  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI) BSR/ASA  S12.75-2012,  Methods  for  the  Measurement  of  Noise  Emissions  from  High Performance  Military  Jet  Aircraft.    This  standard  describes  the  procedures  for  ground run-up and flyover tests for conventional take-offs and landings, and short/vertical take-off  and  landings.    Noise  measurement  field  studies  to  gather  data  for  noise  emissions from aircraft not covered by ANSI BSR/ASA S12.75-2012 will be done in coordination with 711 HPW/RHCB. 3.3.4.  Changes  to  any  NOISEFILE  database  associated  with  the  NOISEMAP  suite  of programs,  or  MR_NMAP,  will  be  approved  by  711  HPW/RHCB  prior  to  use  for  noise AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 21 modeling.    All  approved  changes  will  be  incorporated  into  the  database  controlled  by AFCEC/CPP and provided with updated releases of NOISEMAP and MR_NMAP. 3.3.5.  Changes to reference noise file databases for SARNAM and BNOISE (which is also used  in  the  Air  Gunnery  model)  are  controlled  by  the  US  Army  Engineer  Research  and Development Center (EDRC)/CEERD-CN-N, Champaign, Illinois. 3.3.6.  When  there  is  incomplete  or  unavailable  noise  data  for  a  new  or  existing  weapons system or munitions, use of surrogate/substitute data may be necessary.  The use of surrogate or  substitute  data  is  approved  only  when  actual  noise  data  have  not  been  and  cannot  be obtained for the weapons system or munition being modeled.  When surrogate or substitute data  is  used  due  to  lack  of  actual  aircraft  and  weapon  system  noise  data  for  environmental analysis,  it  will  be  handled  as  missing  data  as  described  in  40  CFR,  Part  1502,  Section 1502.22, Incomplete or Unavailable Data, and the text will include a discussion of the points in  40  CFR  Part  1501,  Section  1502.22(b)  1-4  in  the  environmental  assessment  or  impact statement.    In  all  cases,  the  use  of  surrogate/substitute  aircraft  will  be  approved  by  711 HPW/RHCB (T-1) and its use fully documented.  A list of pre-approved surrogate/substitute aircraft is available from AFCEC/CPP.  Surrogate munitions must be reviewed and approved by Army Public Health Center (Provisional) Operational Noise Program in accordance with the SARNAM and BNOISE end users licensing agreement.  3.4.  Metrics.  The  descriptors  associated  with  noise  level  outputs  from  modeling  testing  and training activities are referred to as metrics.  Metrics can be grouped into two types, primary and supplemental.  Primary  metrics  are  those  used  for  determining  environmental  impacts  from testing and training noise levels.  The NOISEMAP primary metrics are used for determining land use compatibility for the AICUZ program.  Supplemental metrics can be used in addition to the primary  metrics  to  help  local  community  leaders,  general  public  or  readers  of  environmental analysis documents to better understand how noise levels  will change as a result of testing and training  activities.    The  supplemental  metrics  used  in  an  analysis  of  noise  impacts  will  be determined  in  part  by  the  issues  raised  during  scoping  or  the  context  in  which  the  action  is occurring (e.g., if there are no schools in the region of influence then using TA based on school day hours is not necessary).  Table 3.1 lists the primary and supplemental metrics produced by the computer noise models.  More information can be found in the metric section of Attachment 2.    Note:  Before  generating  any  metrics  for  Air  Force  overseas  locations,  consult  with  HQ PACAF and HQ USAFE regarding metrics. Table 3.1.  Computer Noise Models and Associated Noise Metrics.

Analyzing Noise Impacts.  The identification of noise impacts is part of the environmental analysis process.  When it is determined the proposed action or an alternative will produce sound levels  that  could  have  an  impact  on  the  acoustic  environment  and/or  other  aspects  of  the environment  (i.e.,  biological,  natural,  social,  economic,  etc.),  a  description  of  the  acoustic environment and analysis of the impacts  is be prepared.  Attachment 3 discusses concepts that are important to developing a good analysis of noise impacts and a synopsis of the typical issues included in analyzing impacts of noise from military testing or training operations.  requires 3.6.  Education  and  Communication.  An  effective  noise  program frequent communication  and  engagement  with  the  public  through  a  range  of  activities  and  programs including  airmen  training,  responding  to  noise  inquiries  and  complaints,  development  of outreach  materials  and  educational  tools  that  can  be  used  not  only  in  support  of  the  noise program  but  also  the  AICUZ  and  environmental  analysis  programs.    Effective  communication involves  understanding  stakeholders,  defining  communication  strategies,  and  educating  the public,  airmen  and  soldiers  about  noise  and  the  effects  that  it  has  on  the  surrounding communities.    Although  PA  is  primarily  responsible  for  communicating  with  the  public, communicating  effectively  about  noise  requires  a  combined  effort  of  all  organizations  on  an installation  since  questions  and  comments  regarding  noise  from  military  training  are  often directed to other installation personnel.  More information on education and communication can be found in Attachment 4.   Noise Complaint Management 3.7.  Comprehensive Methodology.  Noise inquiries/complaints  from  the  public  are  opportunities  to  engage  and  inform  members  of  the public  as  well  as  opportunities  to  obtain  information  that  can  be  aggregated  and  analyzed  to identify  trends  in  public  perception,  opinions,  or  identify  potential  weaknesses  in  efforts  to manage  or  communicate  about  testing  and  training  noise.    They  can  also  be  used  to  identify problems  for  future  beddowns  and  realignments.    Developing  a  comprehensive  management methodology  requires  standardizing  the  information  collected  from  complainants,  linking  the complaint  and  information  to  geospatial  data  (.i.e.,  location),  weather  conditions,  temporal factors  (time-of-day,  day-of  week,  and  month)  and  the  noise  event  information.    The  noise complaint/inquiry  section  of  Attachment  4  has  more  detail  on  the  type  of  information  to  be collected.    3.8.  Noise  Research/Studies.  The  need  for  studies  or  research  to  better  understand  noise impacts can be identified by the Air Force, another Service or by other Federal or State agencies in their regulatory role or as a cooperating agency in  compliance with 42 USC §§ 4321 et seq.  Any study or research proposal agreed upon is to be designed so other Air Force installations or DoD Services can use the information when faced with impacts and mitigation requirements for similar  actions  in  other  locations.  The  following  steps  should  be  taken  to  ensure  maximum returns  on  investment  for  any  study  or  research  related  to  the  effects  of  aircraft  and  weapons noise to the human, structural, or biological environment.  3.8.1.  To avoid unnecessary expense and duplication of effort, prior to committing to a study or research project during the consultation process, the proponent of  the proposed action or the  Air  Force  office  involved  in  consultations  should  consult  with  the  other  Services  to determine if they have had to address the same issue or have conducted a similar study but not  published  any  findings.  The  711  HPW/RHCB  at  the  Air  Force  Research  Lab,  Wright Patterson AFB is available to help determine if research/studies done in the past can be used in support of the environmental analysis or consultations.   AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 23 3.8.2.  The  711  HPW/RHCB  reviews  all  proposed  studies  or  research  designs  to  ensure  the acoustical component is appropriately defined.  3.8.3.  Coordinate  any  research  or  study  design  proposed  as  a  result  of  consultations  with federal  or  state  agencies  (e.g.,  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service,  NOAA  Fisheries  (for  marine habitats) or state agencies such as the State Historic Preservation Office) to ensure all parties agree with the goals and objectives established for the study or research effort. 3.8.4.  Upon  completion  of  the  study  or  research,  submit  a  copy  of  the  research  report  and results  to  711  HPW/RHCB  for  review  prior  to  final  acceptance  by  the  Air  Force  or  use  of findings in any Air Force environmental analysis. 3.8.5.  Provide electronic copies of final studies and reports to AFCEC/CPP for archiving and future use.  JOHN B.

Acoustical Night−This is a term that may be used in documents to refer to the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m., (those hours during which noise events have a 10 dB penalty applied when calculating DNL) to distinguish this period from the general use of the word “night.”  The term acoustical day may also be used to refer to the hours between 7 a.m. and 10.00 p.m.  See also “environmental night.”    Airfield Operation−Aircraft operations are counted by air traffic controllers for all aircraft operating in the airfield environment.  One airfield operation is counted each time an aircraft passes the departure end of the runway and one airfield operation is counted each time an aircraft passes the approach end of the runway.  When determining the number of aircraft operations occurring in the airfield environment, one aircraft sortie generates a minimum of two airfield operations, one for the initial departure and one for the final landing.  When aircraft are practicing additional Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) or Visual Flight Rules (VFR) approaches (i.e., IFR Closed Patterns or VFR Closed Patterns), two aircraft operations are counted for each pattern, one when they approach the runway to land and one when they depart the runway.  It is important to recognize that airfield operations used for air quality calculations are fewer than airfield operations used for noise as they are counted differently.  For air quality, one operation is counted for a departure, one for an arrival, and one for a closed pattern.    AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 33 Airspace for Special Use (ASU)−Used to collectively identify non-Special Use Airspace assets.  ASU is airspace of defined dimensions wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, and/or wherein limitations may be imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities.  Air Traffic Control−The organization responsible for controlling aircraft movement on the ground and in the air.   Ambient Noise−The total of all noise in the environment, other than the noise from the source of interest.  This term is used interchangeably with background noise.  Annoyance−A summary measure of the general adverse reaction of people to noise that generates speech interference (i.e., being able to use the telephone or listen to television or radio without interruption), sleep disturbance, and desire for a tranquil environment.    A-weighted Sound Level−When measuring community response to noise, it is common to adjust the frequency content of the measured sound to approximate the response of the human ear.  With A-weighting, low and high frequencies are de-emphasized because the ear does not respond equally to sounds of all frequencies, and is less efficient at low and high frequencies than it is at medium or speech range frequencies.  A-weighting is appropriate for transportation noises such as aircraft overflight and small arms noise.  See also “C-weighted Sound Level.” (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Average Annual Day (AAD)−The AAD represents the average number of daily airfield operations that would occur during a 24-hour period based on 365 flying days per year.  AAD is calculated by dividing the total annual airfield operations by 365 days.   C-weighted Day-Night Average Sound Level (CDNL [symbol-LCdn])−CDNL is used for low-frequency impulsive sounds, such as sonic booms, heavy weapons, and other explosions because they are perceived by humans not only by the ear, but also by the whole body as pressure or vibration.  When experienced indoors, impulsive sounds can create secondary noise from rattling and vibrations of the building.  See DNL for additional discussion.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  C-weighted Sound Level−C-weighting is applied to intense low-frequency noise that can cause vibrations, such as heavy bombs and sonic booms.  C-weighting does not apply adjustments to noise signals over most of the audible frequencies, but does apply small adjustments to the very low and very high frequencies.  C-weighting is appropriate for impulsive sounds, such as sonic booms and the deployment of heavy weapons.  When experienced indoors, impulsive sounds can create secondary noise from rattling and vibrations of the building (see also CSEL and CDNL). (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  C-weighted Sound Exposure Level (CSEL)−CSEL is a C-weighted single-event metric used to compare noise levels from individual events.  CSEL is used for impulsive sounds, such as sonic booms and the deployment of heavy weapons (see also SEL).  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  34 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016  Community Noise Equivalent Level (CNEL [symbol-Lden])−This is one of several Day-Evening-Night metrics.  This one is used for off-base land use planning and environmental analysis of noise for all installations and airspace in California.  It is a twenty four hour average A-weighted sound level for a given day after the addition of a 5 dB penalty (sound levels or noise events during this period are equal to 3 daytime events, which creates an actual 4.78 dB penalty) to sound levels between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., in addition to the 10 dB penalty to sound levels that occur between 10:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m.  Japan, Denmark and Finland also use the Day-Evening-Night Level metric, but evening hours are from 7:00 p.m. through 11:00 p.m., and each noise event that occurs during these hours is worth 3.162 daytime events, which results in a full 5 dB penalty.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL [symbol-Ldn])−A twenty four hour average A-weighted sound level for a given day after the addition of a 10 dB weighting is added to account for the increased sensitivity of humans to noise from such things as aircraft operations for sound levels that occur between the hours of 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. because ambient sound levels at night are typically lower than during the daytime hours. (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  DNL/CNEL Contours−Lines of equal DNL/CNEL value.   Environmental Night−This is a term that may be used in documents to refer to the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. to distinguish this period from the general use of the word “nighttime.”  See also “acoustic night.”  Equivalent Sound Level (symbol-Leq)−A twenty four hour Leq is a cumulative noise metric that represents the average sound level over a specified period of time.  Leq does not include any penalty for evening or night time noise events.  Leq is the constant sound level that contains the same sound energy as the time-varying sound level over the same time period.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Installation Complex−The land, facilities, airspace and ranges providing direct mission support to and/or are managed by the installation. This includes a combination of land and facilities comprised of a main installation and its noncontiguous properties (auxiliary airfields, annexes, and missile fields) that provide direct support to or are supported by that installation. Installation complexes may comprise two or more properties, e.g., a major installation, a minor installation, or a support site, each with its associated annex(es) or support property(ies).  Maximum A-weighted Sound Level (symbol-Lmax  or LAFmx)−This is the highest A-weighted sound level within a stated time interval.  For DoD the time interval is typically the duration of the noise event. (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)   Mitigations−These are measures that can be done to reduce, avoid, or repair impacts.  Mitigating the effects of aircraft noise on sensitive land uses such as schools, residential areas, and churches can take many forms, for example, modification to time of day or frequency of use, flight path AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 35 parameters (location, altitude, etc.), or changes to the listener’s environment (building insulation).    NOISEFILE−A database that contains actual (or estimated) noise measurement data formatted for use by NOISEMAP and MR_NMAP.  The database is used to generate the noise versus distance curves for specific aircraft configurations (engine power setting, airspeed) and atmospheric conditions (average temperature and relative humidity).  For NOISEMAP, there are two NOISEFILEs, one containing aircraft flyover data (Flight01) for processing through OMEGA 10 and one containing engine run-up data (Static 01) for processing through OMEGA 11.  For MR_NMAP there is one NOISEFILE for processing through OMEGA10r.   Noise Model Operational Data Documentation (NMODD)−A compilation of the aircraft operational data used in a noise model with the results released in public documents.  It contains points of contacts for the providers of information, all assumptions, spreadsheets used to calculate daily operations, aircraft configurations (i.e., flight profiles) for aircraft operations in the airfield and SUA/ASU, as well as information on engine runs and munitions usage for ranges.  For models using BASEOPS, this information can be generated from the report module.  All spreadsheets are created in a manner that lends itself to use by others.  Noise Sensitive Area−An area where noise interferes with normal activities associated with its use.  Normally, noise sensitive areas include residential, educational, health, and religious structures and sites, and parks, recreational areas (including areas with wilderness characteristics), wildlife refuges, and cultural and historical sites.   Number of Events Above (or at) a Specified Level (NAL)−Metric used to show the total number of noise events that meet or exceed the selected noise level threshold during a specified period of time (e.g., hour, school day, nighttime, etc.).  Combined with the selected threshold level (L), the NA metric is symbolized as NAL.  The threshold L can be defined in terms of either the SEL or Lmax metric.  A threshold level is selected that best meets the need for that situation.  An Lmax threshold is normally selected to analyze speech interference, whereas an SEL threshold is normally selected for analysis of sleep disturbance.    Onset Rate-Adjusted Monthly Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNLmr [symbol-Ldnmr])−The metric used for quantifying noise in special use airspace because aircraft operate differently than in the airport environment, often flying in a more sporadic manner and at low altitudes with speeds greater than 425 miles per hour creating the potential to surprise the receiver.  With DNLmr, the conventional Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL or Ldn) metric is adjusted to account for the “surprise” effect of the sudden onset of aircraft noise events.  Each aircraft operating in SUA/ASU that exhibits a high onset rate have an adjustment or penalty ranging from 0 to 11 dB applied to the normal SEL.  The DNL is then determined in the same manner as for conventional aircraft noise events and is designated as Onset-Rate Adjusted Day-Night Average Sound Level.  The Ldnmr is calculated from month with the most operations (i.e. busiest month).  Onset Rate-adjusted Sound Exposure Level (symbol-SELr)−The A-weighted metric used in the SUA/ASU to compare noise levels from individual events.  Military overflights in SUA/ASU 36 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 differ from airfield operations in that they are generally less frequent, can have a sudden onset, and do not create continuous noise environments.  To represent these differences, the SEL metric is adjusted to account for the surprise of the aircraft noise onset, with an adjustment ranging from 0 up to 11 dB above the normal SEL.  The adjusted SEL is referred to as the onset rate-adjusted SEL (SELr).  Operational Data−Data used to define operational parameters of the aircraft modeled in all noise programs.  Data includes “where” (flight tracks and patterns, SUA/ASU), “how” (altitude, aircraft configuration, airspeed and power setting), and “when” aircraft fly day (0700—2200), night (2200-0700) for DNL and day (0700-1900), evening (1900-2200), and night (2200-0700) for CNEL.  Peak Sound Pressure (symbol-Lpk)−Level of peak sound pressure with stated frequency weighting, within a stated time interval. The decibel version of the peak overpressure that is used as needed to describe a noise event such as a sonic boom or blast for the purposes of relating it to human and animal response.  For impulsive sounds, it is the true instantaneous sound pressure (e.g., the peak pressure of the shock wave for sonic booms).  This pressure is usually presented in physical units of pounds per square foot.  DOD uses un-weighted peak, so make sure the weighting factor is denoted.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Percent Highly Annoyed (%HA)−Percent highly annoyed is the basis for Federal policy on environmental noise.  The December 2009 Defense Noise Working Group (DNWG) Technical Bulletin “Community Annoyance Caused by Noise From Military Aircraft Operations” (DNWG TB2009-1) describes %HA as “the primary effect of recurring aircraft noise on exposed communities is “long-term” annoyance” and acknowledges that “the scientific community has adopted the use of long-term annoyance as a primary indicator of community response because it attempts to account for all negative aspects of effects from noise, including sleep disturbance, speech interference and distraction from other human activities.”  The %HA is the most useful metric for assessing people’s responses to noise. The %HA has become the basis for Federal policy on environmental noise.  The %HA is not converted to the number of “highly annoyed” people in a specific population because many emotional and physical variables can influence the annoyance response of an individual.    Pounds Per Square Foot (psf)−This metric is used when analyzing effects on structures from supersonic flight and use of high explosives   Probability of Awakening−The Probability of Awakening is an estimation of the probability that some part of a population sleeping indoors will be awakened by an outdoor noise event based on the SEL.  The Air Force uses the ANSI for predicting sleep awakenings from multiple noise events during a night-long period (i.e., 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.).  The ANSI S12.9-2008 curve for determining Probability of Awakening from a single event is represented by the following equation:   Where Z= -6.8884 + 0.04444LAE, and LAE represents the indoor A-weighted SEL of an outdoor single noise event.  SELs less than 50 dB shall be ignored; indoor SELs in excess of 100 dB should be used with caution because it is the practical extent of the underlying data and predictions may be underestimated (see also DNWG Technical Bulletin, Sleep Disturbance AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 37 From Aviation Noise,(DNWG TB2009-4).  Probability of Awakening is not converted to the number of people in a specific population who would awaken from a noise event, because the Probability of Awakening relies on probability theory rather than direct field research/experimental data, and may vary depending on local physical variables.  Probability of Awakening is not used where the sleeping populations would be expected to be outside.  Sortie Operation−A sortie-operation is used to define aircraft operations in SUA/ASU.  One sortie operation is counted each time a single aircraft enters an airspace unit, such as a Military Operations Area or Military Training Route for training.   Sound Exposure Level (SEL)−SEL is a composite metric that represents both the magnitude and duration of a time-varying noise event, such as an aircraft overflight.  The SEL is determined using a single number to account for the event as if it occurred during one second; it does not directly represent the sound level heard at any given time.  Rather, it accounts for the noise heard through an entire event, beginning when the noise source first becomes audible, rising up to the maximum level at its closest point to the receiver, and ending when the sound diminishes.  To illustrate, the SEL is the result of taking all of the energy in the figure and squeezing it into the 1 second area, leading to a SEL that is typically higher than the maximum sound level.  SEL is the building block for calculating DNL/CNEL and has proven to be a good number to compare the relative exposure of different transient sounds.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Sound Power Level (PWL)−This is a logarithmic measure of the sound power in comparison to a specified reference level. Sound power is the acoustic energy radiated from a sound source over a unit of time and is measured in watts (W).  PWL is also expressed in units of dB, but its reference value is 1 picoWatt (1 pW).  To avoid confusion, sound power level is usually denoted as dB PWL, whereas sound pressure level is denoted as dB SPL.  Unlike sound pressure, sound power is strictly a measure of the sound source strength and does not depend on location or distance.  Sound power is the total power produced by the source in all directions. (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)   Sound Pressure Level (SPL)−SPL is a logarithmic measure of the effective acoustic pressure of a sound relative to a reference value and is measured in decibels (dB). The SPL is expressed in units of dB and is a ratio of a measured pressure compared to a reference pressure.  The reference pressure for air is 20 microPascals (µPa) which is related to the threshold of human hearing. SPL is a measure of the sound magnitude at a particular location relative to the source.  (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Special Use Airspace (SUA)−Airspace that is of a defined vertical and lateral dimension that alerts users to areas of unusual flight hazards and separates those activities from other airspace users to enhance safety.  Certain limitations or restrictions may be placed on non-participating aircraft.  38 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 Stakeholder−A person or organization, either internal or external to the installation complex, with personal, financial, or other manifest interest in an issue or decision.  Stakeholders include, among others: DoD Components; installation tenants; federal, state, regional and local governments and agencies; Tribal Councils; and individuals or groups outside of an installation or range, or beneath SUA/ASU.  Substitute Aircraft−An aircraft used to represent another aircraft whose noise data is not available in the NOISEFILE data base (see also surrogate aircraft).   Supplemental Metrics−Supplemental Metrics are used to help define the primary metrics, DNL and CNEL, when needed to help characterize the noise environment.    Surrogate Aircraft−An aircraft used to represent another aircraft whose noise data is not available in the NOISEFILE data base (see also substitute aircraft).  Time Above a Specified Level (TAL)−TAL is a measure (expressed in minutes) of the total time that the A-weighted aircraft noise level is at or above a defined sound level threshold over any time period of interest, provided there is operational data to define the time period of interest.  Combined with the selected threshold level (L), the TA metric is symbolized as TAL and can be used to indicate that the sound level at identified locations exceed that noise level for a certain number of minutes per day.    Weapon System−A combination of one or more weapons with all related equipment, materials, services, personnel, and means of delivery and deployment (if applicable) required for self-sufficiency.  For the purposes of this AFI, a weapon system includes aircraft, weapons, and munitions.    Weighted Sound Levels−A and C-weighting are frequency filters applied to sounds that attempt to account for the human perception of loudness.  They are used in noise assessments because weighted sound levels have been shown to correlate moderately well with the human response to noise.  When A-weighting is applied to noise levels, very high and very low sound frequencies that are outside the range of human hearing are screened out, thereby weighting the sound to reflect what people actually hear.  A-weighting is typically used to assess environmental sounds, specifically for the noise generated by transportation sources and small arms use.  C-weighting is applied to intense low-frequency noise that can cause vibrations, such as heavy bombs and sonic booms.  C-weighting does not apply adjustments to noise signals over most of the audible frequencies, but does apply small adjustments to the very low and very high frequencies.  C-weighting is typically used to assess large-amplitude impulsive noises generated when aircraft fly at supersonic speeds and when heavy weapons and large bombs are used. (See ANSI S1.1 for scientifically agreed upon definition.)  Training Exercise−The short-term increase in the normal day-to-day operations-tempo of any training area.    AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 39 Attachment 2 COMPUTER MODELING, DATA, AND METRICS A2.1.  General.  This  attachment  provides  additional  details  regarding  the  computer  models, data required for each model and the metrics the Air Force uses for noise contours in support of the AICUZ program  and environmental  analysis  of the noise impacts  from  testing and training activities.  The  discussions  on  models  and  data  are  organized  by  the  type  of  operational environment  in  which  they  are  used,  e.g.  military  airfield,  civilian  airfield,  SUA/ASU,  air  to ground  ranges,  ground  ranges  and  explosive  ordnance  disposal  proficiency  training  ranges.  At the end of this section, Figure A2-1 summarizes the noise models used for predicting noise levels in  each  type  of  operational  environment.    Table  A2-  1  lists  the  computer  models  and  the  rules related to each model. A2.2.  Computer  Modeling  for  Military  Airfield  Environment.    The  NOISEMAP  suite  of programs (NOISEFILE, BASEOPS, NMPLOT, AAM) is used to predict noise exposure from all flight activity, engine run operations, and the effects of the topography and ground impedance on noise  exposure  from  aircraft  operations  in  the  military  airfield  environment.    Only  the  most recent  DoD version of  NOISEMAP  (identified  on the AFCEC/CPP’s SharePoint® site is  to  be used when preparing noise contours for environmental analysis or the AICUZ program.   A2.2.1.  BASEOPS is the program used for all data input and execution of the NOISEMAP suite of programs (NOISEMAP, RNM, AAM, NMPLOT).  It is the only program authorized for data input, model execution, and data output.  The BASEOPS report functions are used to generate the installation NMODD.  Document such things as aircraft groupings and/or other unusual or non-standard ways of doing things in BASEOPS. A2.2.2.  Use  NMPLOT  to  convert  grid  files  resulting  from  the  NOISEMAP  suite  of programs into noise contours and for generating and exporting noise contours into shape files so they  can be input into a GIS.  NMPLOT contains  analytical  features that  can be used to investigate  noise  complaints,  research  noise  mitigation  techniques,  or  when  in  need  of information  regarding  single  event  or  cumulative  noise  levels  at  any  location  by  providing the top 20 ranked aircraft contributors to the noise environment.  When NMPLOT produces unexplainable  abnormalities  in  noise  contours,  change  the  grid  spacing  in  NOISEMAP and/or NMPLOT to refine the contours.  Noise contours produced by NMPLOT are not to be modified  using  GIS  without  full  justification,  documentation  and  written  permission  of AFCEC/CPP.    This  is  to  ensure  that  anyone  trying  to  validate  the  results  of  the  noise modeling can reproduce the output from NMPLOT.   A2.3.  Computer Modeling for Civilian Airfield Environment.  The overall responsibility for aircraft noise in the civilian airport environment lies with the local airport authority.  The most current  FAA-approved noise model is  AEDT and is  designed specifically  for modeling  aircraft noise  at  civilian  airfields.    AEDT  is  used  to  predict  noise  exposure  in  support  of  14  CFR  Part 150, Airport Noise Compatibility Program and for analyzing noise impacts in the preparation of EAs and EISs in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1F, Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts. A2.3.1.  When requested by the airport authority, the USAF provides copies of the input and output files from the most recent USAF noise analysis (AEDT or NOISEMAP) to the airport authority for their use in updating their noise exposure maps.  40 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A2.3.2.  When  the  Air  Force  has  a  proposed  action  that  will  take  place  at  a  civilian  airport and  the  noise  from  the  military  aircraft  dominate  the  airport’s  acoustic  environment  and/or the  AEDT  standard  flight  profiles  do  not  reflect  local  operating  conditions,  or  are unavailable, approval shall be requested from the FAA to use NOISEMAP to model military aircraft  in  accordance  with  FAA  Order  1050.1F,  Policies  &  Procedures  for  Considering Environmental  Impacts,  paragraph  B-1.2,  Appendix  B.    AEDT  is  used  to  model  civilian aircraft operations and NOISEMAP used to model military aircraft operations, and the results from  each  modeling  run  are  combined  through  NMPLOT  to  produce  a  single  set  of DNL/CNEL contours.   A2.3.3.  When  military  aircraft  have  been  modeled  using  AEDT  in  a  publically  released Noise Exposure Map as part of the  airport’s Part 150 program, AEDT may be used to model both  civilian  and  military  aircraft  for  environmental  analysis  providing  accurate  military aircraft flight profile data is available in the AEDT noise database.   A2.3.4.  If the airport is not participating in the FAA’s Part 150 program nor have an active noise  management  and  AEDT  files  do  not  exist,  civilian  aircraft  may  be  modeled  in NOISEMAP for environmental analysis purposes. A2.3.5.  In all situations, the produce the affected environment noise contours and proposed action noise contours using the same noise model.   A2.4.  Computer  Models  for  SUA/ASU.  Noise  associated  with  SUA/ASU  is  handled somewhat  differently  than  the  airfield  environment  because  it  involves  more  random  flight activity  where  low  altitudes  and  high  airspeeds  can  produce  high  on-set  rates  and  supersonic flights can produce sonic booms.  The following models are used to predict noise in SUA/ASU.  Note: The FAA has approved specific noise models for modeling impacts from proposed actions involving SUA/ASU. The use of models other than the ones approved by the FAA requires pre-approval  by  the  FAA.    Use  FAA  Order  1050.1F,  Appendix  A,  Section  14  for  assistance  in determining  whether  a  noise  analysis  is  warranted  and  if  so,  what  type  of  analysis  should  be conducted. A2.4.1.  The most recent version of MR_NMAP (as identified in  the Noise Toolbox on the CPP  SharePoint®  site)  is  used  for  predicting  the  noise  exposure  from  aircraft  operating  at subsonic airspeeds within SUAA/ASU.  The FAA’s Office of Environment and Energy has approved the use of MR_NMAP for use and analysis of SUA/SUA (FAA Order 1050.1F).  A2.4.2.  Use BASEOPS to generate MR_NMAP input files.  The BASEOPS report functions will  be  used  to  generate  input  into  the  installation  NMODD.    NMPLOT  is  used  to  display input and output from MR_NMAP in graphical form. A2.4.3.  Use  PCBOOM4  when  needed  to  predict  the  sonic  boom  footprint  of  individual supersonic flight operations.  Its use requires knowledge of supersonic flight parameters and sonic  booms.    It  is  designed  to  analyze  sonic  booms  from  single  sorties,  with  emphasis  on identifying the specific pattern and amplitude of the footprint.  Use of PCBOOM during the EIAP  in  which the FAA is  a cooperating agency requires written approval  from  the FAA’s Office of Environment and Energy in accordance with FAA Order 1050.1F.  A2.4.4.  Use  BOOMAP  when  predicting  the  cumulative  sonic  boom  environment  for  air combat maneuvering operations where speeds exceed Mach 1 and sonic boom events tend to be brief, but occur often enough that cumulative effects are of concern.  BOOMAP does not AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 41 accurately predict sonic  booms from  aircraft  with super-cruise  capability, such as the  F-22.  Contact  AFCEC/CPP  for  guidance  in  calculating  sonic  boom  noise  levels  for  aircraft  with super-cruise capability.  The FAA’s Office of Environment and Energy has approved the use of BOOMAP for use and analysis of SUA/ASU (FAA Order 1050.1F). A2.5.  Computer  Models  for  Air-to-Ground  Ranges.  Noise  associated  with  air-to-ground Ranges is  dependent  on  the use of the range.   It  is  based on two factors,  the aircraft overflight and the munitions used for training.   A2.5.1.  Use  MR_NMAP  to  predict  noise  from  subsonic  aircraft  overflight  where  inert munitions are used as described under SUA/ASU.  A2.5.2.  Noise modeling is not required for use of inert munitions, i.e., Bomb Dummy Units.  The noise associated with the aircraft would dominate the noise environment. A2.5.3.  Use  Air  Gunnery  Model  to  develop  noise  levels  from  Air-to-ground  firing.    It  is designed to predict elevated weapon noise and is used for predicting noise from muzzle blast, rocket  propulsion,  and  sonic  booms  resulting  from  the  use  of  supersonic  projectiles  (i.e., bullets  and rockets).   It  should be noted that for HE bombs, the explosion on the ground is handled by BNOISE. A2.6.  Computer  Models  for  Ground  Training  Ranges  and  EOD  Proficiency  Training Ranges.  Because  noise  from  ground  sources  have  different  characteristics  than  aircraft  noise and the propagation path of ground based weapons is different from aircraft different computer models are used.   A2.6.1.  SARNAM  is  used  for  predicting  noise  levels  for  small  arms  (≤.50  caliber  or  less.  SARNAM  is  designed  for  ranges  with  fixed  firing  points  and  targets  and  its  use  for  other training  tactics  will  be  limited.    The  Army  Public  Health  Center  (Provisional)  Operational Noise Program  must validate all SARNAM input files prior to release in a public document as  required  by  the  End  User  License  Agreement  for  the  U.S.  Army  Engineer  Research  and Development  Center  noise  modeling  software  “SARNAM”  and  “BNOISE”  family  of computer programs.   A2.6.2.  Noise level predictions for Ranges for large caliber weapons (≥ 20 millimeter) and EOD  proficiency  training  ranges  is  done  using  the  most  current  version  of  BNOISE.  BNOISE files require validation by the Army Public Health Center (Provisional) Operational Noise  Program  prior  to  release  in  a  public  document.    BNOISE2  version  control  is  the responsibility of the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center/CEERD-CN-N, Champaign, Illinois.    42 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 Figure A2.1.

Used to predict noise generated from small arms ranges (.50 caliber and smaller) for environmental analysis AICUZ studies for Air Force led Joint Bases with an Army supported component   Input files require validation by the. Army Public Health Center (Provisional) Operational Noise Program prior to release in a public document  A2.7.  Data  Needed  for  Noise  Level  Predictions.  Each  model  has  its  own  operational  data requirements  and methods for obtaining that data.  Tables A2-2  and A2-3 contain  examples of operational data used by several of the computer models. Collection A2.7.1.  Airfield  Environment  Operational  Data.  Use  proven  interview  techniques  for obtaining  the  operational  data  to  be  used  in  the  noise  models.    The  Air  Force  Operational Data https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home.aspx  should  be  used  as  the  guide  for obtaining  operational  data  to  be  used  with  the  NOISEMAP  suite  of  programs.    Currently there is no approved automated data collection method.  Using radar data or other Air Traffic Control  data  requires  the  pre-approval  of  AFCEC/CPP.    BASEOPS  is  used  to  input  all operational data into NOISEMAP (see paragraph A2.2.1).   Handbook found at: A2.7.1.1.  Aircraft  operational  and  engine  run-up  data  for  based  aircraft  is  specific  to each installation and is be obtained from and validated by the operators and maintainers, and certified by each squadron commander. A2.7.1.2.  Yearly  traffic  counts  provided  by  air  traffic  control  should  be  used  only  to validate the operational numbers used to generate noise contours. A2.7.1.3.  Use  of  standard  flight  profiles  contained  within  BASEOPS  is  limited  to transient aircraft not using the airfield on a daily basis or where base-specific operational profiles are unobtainable through pilot interviews.  Standard profile data will be adjusted as  necessary  to  accurately  reflect  local  flying  rules  and  noise  abatement  procedures.  When  there  are  multiple  types  of  transient  aircraft  with  very  few  daily  operations  (less than  0.50),  aircraft  may  be  grouped  with  similar  aircraft  in  an  appropriate  category  for AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 45 noise  modeling  purposes.    In  all  cases,  document  aircraft  groupings  in  BASEOPS  for future reference.  A2.7.1.4.  Topography and elevation files is to be used, and all non-water areas is to be modeled  as  “soft”  ground  (~200  kPa-s/m^2).    Open  water  and  areas  designated  as wetlands  that  are  inundated  more  than  50  percent  of  the  year,  are  considered  as  hard ground,  otherwise  use  soft  ground.    All  noise  contours  used  for  the  “affected environment” developed for the acoustical environment section in environmental analysis documents, that were not originally developed using topography and elevation files will need to be revised using those files.   This may result in noise contours that do not match those previously released in a public document.  In these instances, a statement that the baseline  noise  contours  have  been  updated  to  include  the  effects  of  topography  and elevation resulting in changes in the noise environment will be included.  Once AAM and legacy aircraft spheres are approved for use, National Land Cover Data impedance values will be used. (SUA)/Airspace for  Special  Use A2.7.2.  Special  Use  Airspace (ASU)  and Ranges.  Defining the affected (i.e. baseline) acoustical  environment  used in  environmental impact  analysis documents  for the SUA/ASU, air-to-ground ranges, small  arms and ground ranges  requires  current  operational  data.    Existing  records  can  be  used  if  they  have  been reviewed and validated by the appropriate airspace manager or range operating authority as being  representative  of  current  operations  in  accordance  with  AFI  13-201,  Airspace Management, AFI 13-212, Range Planning and Operations, and AFI 36-226, Combat Arms Program.  For Army  ground ranges and small  arms ranges at  an Air  Force lead Joint Base with an Army supported component the operational data should be reviewed and validated by the  Director  of  Plans,  Training,  Mobilization  and  Security  Directorate  or  Chief  of  Range Control.  All operational data for the proposed action and alternatives should be provided by the  proponent  of  the  action  in  coordination  with  the  appropriate  airspace  manager/range operating authority or Chief of Range Control for Army ranges.   A2.7.2.1.  High-speed aircraft, engine power settings, and airspeed are to be restricted to the settings in the NOISEFILE associated with MR_NMAP.  A2.7.2.2.  The  minimum  data  points  needed  for  MR_NMAP  model  input  are  found  in Table A2-2. Data should be provided for each dissimilar mission. A2.7.2.3.  The  minimum  data  points  needed  for  SARNAM  and  BNOISE  are  found  in Table A2-3 Data should be provided for each range training area.   46 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 Table A2.2.

Noise  Metrics.  The computer models can produce noise levels using several descriptors or  metrics.  Table  A2-4  at  the  end  of  this  section  summarizes  which  metrics  are  produced  by which computer models.  A2.8.1.  Depending on the source of the noise, noise levels used in the USAF are either A-weighted  or  C  weighted.    Human  hearing  is  less  sensitive  at  very  low  and  very  high frequencies,  so  weighting  applies  frequency  filters  to  sounds  to  account  for  the  human perception  of  loudness.    A-weighted  noise  levels  are  not  to  be  combined  with  C-weighted (nor will the contours be joined).   A2.8.1.1.  Aweighting de-emphasizes those frequencies that humans don’t hear very well so that emphasis is placed on the mid-frequency sounds that are more closely related to human hearing.  When assessing noise effects related to subsonic aircraft operations and small  arms  (less  than  20  millimeters)  use  A-weighting.    When  the  majority  or  all  noise levels in a document are A-weighted, it is acceptable to drop the “A- weighted” and use “dB” as long as the use of A-weighting is understood.  48 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A2.8.1.2.  C-weighting slightly emphasizes the lower frequencies but does not emphasize other  frequencies  that  are  treated  as  un-weighted  sounds.    When  assessing  the  potential noise  effects  on  humans,  terrestrial  wildlife  and  marine  life  from  supersonic  aircraft operations,  large  weapons  (equal  to  or  greater  than  20  millimeters)  and  blast  noise sources, noise is C-weighted.  A2.8.2.  Primary Metrics  A2.8.2.1.  Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL).  DNL is the primary metric used by Federal  Agencies  for  analyzing  noise  effects  around  airfields.    It  does  not  represent  the actual  sound  level  heard  at  any  one  point  in  time.    DNL  is  an  average  that  takes  into account  the  sound  exposure  levels  of  all  individual  events  that  occur  during  a  24-hour period, penalizes night operations to account for an increased sensitivity to noise during sleeping hours, and then divides the sum by the total number of seconds in a day (Federal Interagency  Committee  on  Noise,  Federal  Agency  Review  of  Selected  Airport  Noise Analysis Issues, August, 1992).  DNL is the best single system of noise measurement that can  be  uniformly  applied  in  communities  around  airports  for  compatible  land  use planning  and  for  which  there  is  a  relationship  between  projected  noise  and  surveyed reaction of people to the noise (Schultz Curve 1978 and Finegold  et al. 1994).  DNL is the  primary  noise  metric  used  for  describing  long-term  noise  impacts  for  sub-sonic aircraft operations  and small  weapons noise,  and is  the primary metric used to  describe the noise environment in the airfield vicinity for programs such as AICUZ and EIAP.   A2.8.2.1.1.  DNL  is  the  Federal  standard  for  determining  impacts  to  the  human environment and is used to describe and predict long-term noise impacts for sub-sonic aircraft operation.    A2.8.2.1.2.  Daily  operations  for  noise  modeling  are  calculated  using  the  Average Annual  Day  (AAD)  method  (yearly  operations  divided  by  365  days  per  year).    The number  of  AAD  operations  are  to  be  rounded  to  the  nearest  hundredth  (i.e.,  two decimal places), and the number of arrivals and departures should always be equal.  A2.8.2.1.3.  DNL  contours  developed  for  environmental  analysis  are  presented  in  5 dB  increments  from  65  to  85  dB.    DNL  is  used  for  describing  the  existing  noise environment and for analyzing noise effects in the airfield.  A2.8.2.1.4.  To  ensure  that  the  reader  of  any  NEPA  document  or  AICUZ  study understands that noise levels do not abruptly stop at the 65 dB noise contour, or the other contour lines, the presentation of noise levels on maps  includes both the solid contour  lines  along  with  color  bands  that  gradually  transition  from  red  at  the  upper noise levels to yellow, to green to purple at the lower noise levels (whenever feasible from a presentation standpoint).  The use of translucent colors allows features on the installation maps to  be seen by the reader.  This  technique communicates the actual noise  exposure.    Because  the  colors  reflect  noise  levels  lower  than  65,  it  does  not mean that additional contour lines should be shown, nor does it indicate there is any significance attached to the noise 65 dB or higher noise contours has changed. A2.8.2.2.  Community  Noise  Equivalent  Level  (CNEL)  contours  are  used  in  AICUZ studies and for analyzing noise impacts in NEPA documents for installations, ranges and AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 49 airspace in California.  AICUZ studies will include a separate DNL contour map for on-base planning.  A2.8.2.3.  When necessary for environmental analysis or public outreach, operations for short-term  military  training  exercises  may  be  calculated  based  on  the  duration  of  the event  and  presented  as  short-term  DNL/CNEL  contours  to  supplement  the  traditional DNL contour.  All presentation materials are to be clearly marked as “Training Exercise Noise  Contours—Not  for  Land  Use  Planning  Purposes.”    When  using  this  method, emphasis is to be placed on the Name of the Exercise and Number of Days per year the exercise is  expected to  occur.  Short-term  noise contours do not  replace the AAD noise contours presented in AICUZ study or other land use planning documents.  A2.8.2.4.  Onset  rate-adjusted  monthly  day-night  average  sound  level  (DNLmr or  Ldnmr).  This metric is used for quantifying noise impacts in SUA/ASU and when predicting noise exposure  resulting  from  subsonic  aircraft  operations  using  SUA/ASU  and  air-to-ground ranges. A2.8.2.4.1.  Noise  contours  may  be  developed  for  SUA/ASU  associated  with  air-to-ground ranges where the DNLmr of 65 dB extends outside of the range boundaries. A2.8.2.4.2.  DNLmr levels are documented in table format for all other SUA/ASU. A2.8.2.5.  C-weighted Day-Night Average Sound Level (CDNL or LCdn).  This metric is used  for  large  weapons  (20  millimeter  and  greater)  and  other  blast  noise  sources  when predicting noise exposure on military ranges.  It does not represent the actual sound level heard at any one point in time.  A2.8.2.5.1.  C-weighting is appropriate for low-frequency impulsive sounds, such as sonic booms, heavy weapons, and other blast noise sources. A2.8.2.5.2.  For  Air  Force  led  Joint  Bases  with  an  Army  supported  Component,  C weighted DNL contours are to be plotted in 5 dB increments from 62 dB to 80 dB. A2.8.2.5.3.  Sonic booms CDNL contours are plotted in 5 dB increments. A2.8.2.5.5.  When  discussing  C-weighted  metrics,  it  should  be  disclosed  that  when experienced  indoors,  impulsive  sounds  can  create  secondary  noise  from  rattling  and vibrations of the building. A2.8.2.6.  Peak  Sound  Pressure  Level  (Lpk)  is  the  primary  metric  for  small  caliber weapons (.50 caliber or less) and for small arms range noise modeled with SARNM. A2.8.2.7.  Other countries may use other noise metrics for aircraft noise.  Some countries have  dedicated  offices  that  generate  official  aircraft  noise  metrics.    Check  with  HQ PACAF  and  HQ  USAFE  Civil  Engineering  detachments  before  generating  any  AICUZ noise  contours  or  preparing  analysis  of  noise  impacts  for  environmental  reviews  at  Air Force installations overseas. A2.8.3.  Supplemental  Metrics.  DNL/CNEL  can  be  supplemented  by  other  metrics  to characterize specific effects on a case-by-case basis, and to help the reader understand what they might experience from changes to the noise environment.  These metrics are not be used instead  of  DNL  for  determining  significance  of  aircraft  noise  at  bases  in  CONUS  and  US Territories. 50 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A2.8.3.1.  Supplemental  metrics  are  intended  enhance  the  understanding  of  pertinent facts  surrounding  the  change  in  the  noise  environment.    These  may  include  the  use  of metrics  such  as  Equivalent  Sound  Level  (Leq)  or  single  event  metrics  such  as  SEL  and Lmax, or descriptions of the noise environment in terms of the number of times or minutes of  exposure  at  a  specific  location  during  an  average  day.    Uses  for  each  supplemental metric are listed below.  Additional discussion can be found in Defense Noise Working Group’s (DNWG) Technical Bulletin for Using Supplemental Noise Metrics and Analysis Tools  (DNWG  TB2009-2),  DNWG  Guide  to  Using  Supplemental  Metrics:    Improving Aviation  Noise  Planning,  Analysis  and  Public  Communications  with  Supplemental Metrics, (DNWG TB2009-3); and DoD’s Planning in the Noise Environment, AFM 19-10  (1978)  (located  in  the  Noise  Toolbox  on  AFCEC/CPP’s  SharePoint®  site:  https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home).   A2.8.3.2.  Equivalent Sound Level (Leq) is a useful metric for describing the total aircraft noise exposure over an extended or limited period of time without any penalties applied.  The specified time can be an hour,  a school  day, daytime, nighttime, a full 24 hours or even  a  weekend.    Leq  values  for  a  less  than  24-hour  day  can  be  useful  for  determining impacts to sensitive locations.    A2.8.3.2.1.  For  example,  an  8-hour  Leq  can  be  calculated  for  the  time  of  day  that  a school  is  in  session  and  used  to  determine  classroom  impacts  providing  that operational  data  is  available  for  that  time  period.    Leq  may  also  be  used  when predicting habituation to aircraft overflights by domestic animals and wildlife. A2.8.3.2.2.  When  used,  Leq  is  shown  in  tabular  format  for  discrete  locations  of interest.    Leq  contours  are  used  for  calculating  the  number  of  people  that  may  have increased  risk  of  hearing  loss  (see  Attachment  5,  Table  5.7-3)  but  should  not  be published  in  public  documents  in  order  to  avoid  them  being  confused  with  DNL contours. A2.8.3.3.  Sound  Exposure  Level  (SEL)  is  an  A-weighted  decibels  metric  used  when analyzing the probability of awakening from aircraft operations, noise effects to domestic animals  and  wildlife,  and  when  comparing  sound  levels  from  different  types  of  aircraft and different aircraft operations. A2.8.3.4.  C-weighted  Sound  Exposure  Level  (CSEL)  is  used  to  describe  the  individual noise resulting from single impulsive sounds, such as sonic booms and the deployment of heavy weapons. A2.8.3.5.  Onset  Rate-adjusted  Sound  Exposure  Level  (SELr)  is  an  A-weighted  metric used in the SUA/ASU to compare noise levels from individual events (see also SEL).  A2.8.3.6.  Maximum A-weighted Sound Level (Lmax) is an A-weighted metric used in the assessment  of  speech  intelligibility  and  interference.    Additionally,  it  may  be  used independently  or  together  with  SEL  to  compare  noise  levels  from  different  aircraft  and different  aircraft  configurations,  and  for  noise  effects  to  domestic  animals  and  wildlife.  Lmax is not be used to measure the overall intrusiveness of an event.  A2.8.3.7.  Un-weighted  Peak Sound Pressure (Lpk) may be used  when referencing noise from sonic boom, small arms, large weapons, and blast noise to human responses.  Peak levels also correlate well with airborne vibration and structural response. AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 51 A2.8.3.7.1.  BNOISE can produce any peak level, however Peak 15 and Peak 50 are typically the primary peak metrics used because they show the influence of weather conditions:  Peak  15  represents  adverse  conditions,  and  Peak  50  represents  neutral weather conditions.  If operations were to take place under all conditions, the Peak 15 would be the single event peak level exceeded by 15 percent of events, (i.e. 85% of the  events  will  fall  within  the  Peak  15  band).    Only  under  extreme  propagation conditions (i.e., low clouds or temperature inversion) will peak noise levels be louder than  the  predicted  Peak  15.    Peak  50  is  the  single  event  peak  level  exceeded  by  50 percent  of  events,  and  represents  neutral  conditions.    Be  aware  that  peak  levels  can also  be  significantly  lower  than  predicted  PK15  and  PK50  levels  under  favorable conditions.   A2.8.3.7.2.  The contour generated by SARNAM when the Peak metric is selected, is actually Peak 15 vs an average peak (i.e., Peak 50). A2.8.3.8.  Pounds Per Square Foot (psf) is used when analyzing effects of structures from supersonic activity and high explosive events. A2.8.3.9.  Number-of-Events  Above  (NAL)  has  a  distinct  advantage  in  communicating current  and  projected  noise  exposure  in  a  way  not  available  through  the  use  of  other metrics  or  tools.    It  is  the  only  supplemental  metric  that  combines  single  event  noise levels  with  the  number  of  aircraft  operations.    It  answers  the  questions  of  how  many aircraft  would  be  expected  to  fly  over  a  given  location  or  area  at  or  above  a  certain threshold level.  NAL has proven useful as an indicator of the effects that aircraft noise will  have  on  certain  human  activities,  specifically,  the  number  of  times  a  day  (or  other time period) that a person’s activities could be interfered with, or the number of nighttime noise events that may cause some level of sleep disturbance.  NAL should not be reported as  an  absolute  number  and  when  used  in  the  airfield  environment  should  include  an explanation of runway usage and a normalized flying schedule that contains typical times of day of mission departures and arrivals.  Similarly, when used in SUA/ASU or Range environments,  supporting explanations of flight  training procedures should be provided.  When used, NAL is shown in tabular format. A2.8.3.10.  Time Above (TA) is useful for describing the noise environment in schools, particularly  when  comparing  different  operational  scenarios.    TA  analysis  can  be conducted along with NA analysis so the results show not only how many events occur above  the  selected  threshold(s),  but  also  the  total  duration  of  those  events  above  those levels  for  the  selected  time  period.    When  used,  TA  can  be  portrayed  for  single  or multiple locations and is to be shown in tabular format.   52 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 Table A2.4.

Overview.    The  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969  (NEPA)  [42  U.S.  Code (U.S.C.) §4321] and the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the  Procedural  Provisions  of  NEPA  require  Federal  agencies  to  ensure  the  potential  impact  of proposed  actions  are  considered  early  and  throughout  the  decision-making  process.  This attachment  provides  an  overview  of  both  short  and  long-  term  impacts  of  noise  from  military aircraft and weapon systems.   A3.1.1.  There  are  a  number  of  proposed  actions  that  may  require  an  analysis  of  noise impacts  if  they  are  part  of  a  proposed  action.    Aircraft  related  actions  include:  beddown  or realignment  of  existing  or  new  aircraft,  shifting  operations  to  a  different  runway,  major change  in  operational  tempo  or  in  number  of  nighttime  flight  operations,  changing departure/arrival  pattern  flight  tracks,  establishing  new  testing  or  training  activities  or changes  to  existing  ones,  conducting  supersonic  flight  operations  below  30,000  ft.  AGL  or development  of  new  or  changes  to  existing  SUA/ASU.    Ground  training  actions  include beddown  or  realignment  of  new  weapon  systems;  establishing  or  modifying  new  training areas  or  ranges,  (air-to-ground,  EOD  proficiency  training  or  artillery  ranges/maneuvering areas).  Screening guidelines to help determine whether detailed analysis for aircraft noise is necessary the  Noise  Toolbox  on  AFCEC/CPP’s  SharePoint®  site:  https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home.   located is in A3.1.2.  Noise from tanks and ground vehicles being driven along roads and for maneuvers are typically only an issue if they are going to be operating in areas located close to the base boundary  and  there  are  residences  nearby.    Artillery  or  gunfire  from  these  vehicles  may extend beyond the base  boundary depending on  the proximity to  the boundary.  Short-term noise  impacts  typically  includes  noise  generated  by  construction  activities,  e.g.  jack hammers, large truck, bulldozer, generators, etc.  Analysis of this type of noise is especially important if there is residential or other noise sensitive land uses nearby.   A3.2.  Coordinating with  Other  Agencies.  The Air Force is often required to coordinate with other agencies on proposals that have a potential to change the existing noise environment.  The following  is  information  on  those  agencies  in  which  noise  is  typically  the  driver  behind  the requirement to consult.   A3.2.1.  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA).    The  FAA  is  responsible  for  compliance with  the  most  current  version  of  FAA  Order  1050.1,  Environmental  Impact:  Policies  and Procedures, for all public airports and all navigable airspace in the United States.   A3.2.1.1.  Airports. for  Air  Force  projects,  FAA Memorandum, July 28, 2009, Subject:  AEE and Airports Coordination Policy for Non-Standard Modeling Procedures and Methodology applies.     When  using  NOISEMAP A3.2.1.2.  Special  Use  Airspace  (SUA)  and  Airspace  for  Special  Use  (ASU).    Some proposed  Air  Force  actions  involving  SUA/ASU  may  require  the  FAA  to  make  a decision.    To  minimize  unnecessary  duplication  of  effort,  for  all  actions  for  which  the FAA  must  make  a  decision  (i.e.  triggers  formal  rule  making),  complete  the  noise modeling and subsequent environmental analysis to support the FAA’s decision.  54 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A3.2.2.  National Park Service.  Coordination occurs with the National Park Service when a National Park is located within an area of frequent military aircraft activity. When there is the potential  for  elevated  noise  levels  to  affect  National  Park  resources  or  the  potential  for structural  damage,  consult  with  the  National  Park  that  could  be  impacted  early  in  the environmental analysis process.   A3.2.3.  U.S.  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service.    Under  Section  7  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act, federal  agencies  must  consult  with  the  United  States  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  when  any action  the  agency  carries  out,  funds,  or  authorizes  has  the  potential  to  affect  a  listed endangered  or  threatened  species.    If  there  are  potential  impacts  to  federally  listed  species, consultation  with  the  United  States  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  is  required  and  mitigation measures may be developed through the consultation process. A3.2.4.  State  Historic  Preservation  Offices/Tribal  Historic  Preservation  Offices.    AFI  32-7065  requires  consideration  of  historic  properties  by  federal  agencies.    Noise  (audible) intrusions  and  damage  to  historic  properties  are  recognized  as  examples  of  adverse  effects under  36  CFR  800.5(a)(2).    If  the  Air  Force  determines  the  action  has  the  potential  to adversely affect historic properties, or properties to which federally recognized Indian tribes may  attach  religious  and  cultural  significance,  coordinate  early  in  the  process  to  identify sensitive sites and areas and conduct consultation is essential.   A3.3.  Defining  the  Concept  of  Operations.  It is important to develop a thorough description of the noise generating testing/ training operations as early as possible in the proposal planning process.    This  information  is  used  to  determine  the  type  of  the  noise  the  proposed  action  will generate,  i.e.  subsonic  aircraft  noise,  sonic  booms,  small-arms  range  noise,  blast  noise  from artillery/mortars  or  EOD  proficiency  training,  the  types  of  operational  data  required,  and  the models and metrics to be used for predicting noise levels.   It  also makes it easier to provide a more thorough a detailed description the proposed action to the public.   A3.4.  Acoustic  Conditions  of  the  No-Action  Alternative.  The  No-Action  Alternative represents  the  future  condition  of  the  acoustic  environment  at  the  base,  range  or  under  the airspace that will exist if the proposed action (or an alternative is not implemented).  It represents the  conditions  from  against  which  the  impacts  of  the  proposed  action  and  alternatives  are evaluated.    For  noise  analysis  purposes,  the  No-Action  Alternative  noise  levels  include  noise from proposed aircraft operations that were previously analyzed but the decision has not yet been fully implemented.   A3.5.  The  Acoustic  Environment.  When  it  is  determined  that  the  proposed  action  or  an alternative  could  produce  noise  levels  that  may  potentially  have  a  significant  impact,  noise impacts  need  to  be  evaluated  in  detail  using  the  appropriate  computer  model,  operational  data, and metrics to predict the noise levels from the proposed action and alternatives.  Noise is a by-product  from  operating  military  aircraft  or  weapon  systems;  it  is  not  a  “resource.”    For  the purposes of the environmental analysis, the aspect of the environment that could be impacted by the operation of aircraft or weapon systems is existing “acoustic environment.”  The discussion would focus on how the acoustic environment will change as a result of the proposed operations of the aircraft or weapon systems.  For purposes of this AFI and environmental analysis of noise impacts, the definition of the acoustic environment is the acoustical conditions in which people, animals, and plants live or operate.   AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 55 A3.5.1.  The  concept  of  operations  for  the  action  alternatives  determines  the  geographical area  for  the  extent  of  the  acoustic  environment  that  needs  to  be  evaluated.    For  aircraft operations  generally  this  will  be  either  the  area  near  the  installation,  range  or  under  the SUA/ASU or all three areas.  For ground based proposed actions, it will generally be near the installation or the installations training areas. A3.5.1.1.  The airfield or installation acoustic environment is typically defined as the area within  the  65+  DNL/CNEL  or  62  CDNL  contours  for  all  alternatives.    However,  this region  can  be  influenced  by  the  surrounding  community  and  sensitive  land  uses  within the community.  If noise sensitive land uses exist near the edge of the 65 dB DNL/CNEL or  62  CDNL  zone  the  region  for  evaluating  impacts  may  need  to  extend  into  areas immediately  outside  the  zone.    For  the  installation  environment,  AFCEC/CPP  should have  the  most  recent  set  of  environmental  analysis  or  AICUZ  noise  modeling  output noise  contours  and  associated  NMODD.  However,  this  output  may  not  include  the changes to noise resulting from any categorically excluded actions subsequent to the date of the most recent noise modeling.   A3.5.1.2.  The geographic extent of the acoustic environment for SUA/ASU is typically the entire area underlying each respective alternative. A3.5.1.3.  The  geographic  extent  of  the  acoustic  environment  for  either  air-to-ground ranges  or  ground  ranges  is  determined  by  the  extent  of  the  DNL,  CDNL  or,  Peak  15 contours.  A3.6.  Calculating Acreage and Population.  Identify the number of acres of land affected by the  noise  from  the  military  activity,  and  human  population  (both  on  and  off  base)  exposed  to high  noise  levels.    For  the  airfield  environment,  use  geospatial  data  and  GIS  software  in combination with the DNL contour map to calculate changes to number of acres within in each DNL  noise  zone  for  both  the  affected  environment  noise  conditions  and  the  environmental consequences. A3.6.1.  The most current U.S. Census block data (or lowest level available) is used to define the  exposed  populations  residing  off-base.    Information  to  determine  on-base  populations exposed  to  noise,  the  base  housing  office  can  provide  data  for  on-base  residents  and  the installation finance office can provide data on the number of people working on base.  When on-base  housing  data  is  used,  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  on  base  populations  are  not included in the Census data to avoid double counting.   A3.6.2.  Generally  it  is  assumed  that  the  population  is  distributed  equally  through  each census block in urban areas unless it is clear from local land use data that the entire census block  is  residential.    In  these  situations,  additional  research  using  local  resources  may  be necessary  to  calculate  the  population  exposed  to  noise.    In  rural  areas,  population distributions  are  variable  based  on  the  location  of  population  centers  within  each  block.  There are times when using the equal distribution assumption is not reasonable because there are large areas within the census block that do not contain residences.  In this situation, aerial imagery or  ground survey  should be used to  assist  in  determining more realistic population distribution. A3.7.  Noise and Land Use Compatibility.  For the airfield environment, this section analyzes the  change  in  the  number  of  acres  of  various  land  uses  within  the  noise  zone  that  would  be 56 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 incompatible with the noise from military operations.  The compatibility evaluation is based on Air Force land use compatibility tables in the AICUZ Instruction AFI 32-7063.  A comparison of number  of  acres  considered  incompatible  in  both  the  before  and  after  conditions  is  typically presented in a table, along with a land use or zoning map with noise contours.   A3.7.2.  For  the  SUA/ASU  environment,  the  long  term  noise  levels  are  rarely  high  enough that  there  would  be  incompatible  land  uses.    However,  special  management  areas  such  as National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, etc., may require additional analysis.  A3.7.3.  Any special management areas such as around airfields or under the SUA/ASU are considered  noise  sensitive  and  may  require  more  detailed  analysis  and  use  of  supplemental metrics that indicate how often military noise would be noticeable. A3.8.  Effects  of  Noise-Induced  Vibration  on  Structures.    The  potential  for  damage  to structures  from  noise-induced  vibration  is  often  a  concern  raised  by  the  public.    Noise  from explosive detonations, sonic booms, and large arms firing can cause buildings to vibrate, which the  occupants  experience  as  shaking  of  the  structure  and  rattling  of  the  windows.    Residents typically  believe  the  vibrations  can  cause  structural  damage.    The  probability  of  this  shaking causing structural damage is minimal.   A3.8.1.  Although vibration can travel from a source to the receiver both through the ground (ground-borne) and air (airborne), the distance that ground-borne vibration travels is limited and what residents perceive is overwhelmingly airborne vibration.  Airborne vibration is the dominant cause of structural vibration off the installation.  Most studies of airborne vibration and the damage guidelines derived from these studies used sonic booms as the source.  These same  guidelines  can  be  applied  to  vibration  from  artillery  and  tank  main-gun  firing.    The threshold of human perception of vibration is far below the threshold of structural damage.   A3.8.2.  Measuring  vibration  levels  can  be  an  involved  undertaking  requiring  very specialized equipment and expertise.  Therefore, often a simplified means to evaluate damage potential  is  by  using  the  un-weighted  Peak  Sound  Pressure  Level  (dBP).    Multiple  studies have shown that the Peak level correlates directly with vibration.  The Peak level is easier to measure and can also be predicted through the DoD’s blast noise model. A3.8.3.  Subsonic  overflight  noise.    Based  on  experimental  data  and  models,  noise  and vibrations from  subsonic aircraft overflights  are  unlikely to  damage  architectural  resources, including adobe buildings.   A3.8.4.  Sonic  Boom/Blast  Noise.    Conventional  structures  (i.e.,  residences,  churches, schools)  typically  do  not  suffer  extensive  damage  from  sonic  booms  and  blast  noise  from ground  testing  or  training  range  activity.    However,  there  have  been  very  rare  incidences where damage may occur to structures in poor condition.   A3.8.4.1.  There have been several instances where military fighter jets flying supersonic have  caused  windows  to  break.    The  window  is  generally  the  weakest  part  of  a conventional  structure.  Although there are a number of investigators have attempted to characterize the probability distribution of the pressure at which glass panes fail, there is a lack of consensus.  For example, at 1 pound per square foot (psf), the probability of a window  breaking  ranges  from  one  in  a  billion  (Sutherland  1990)  to  one  in  a  million (Hershey  and Higgins  1976).  These damage rates are associated with  a combination of boom load and glass condition.  For example, laboratory tests of glass (White 1972) have AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 57 shown that properly installed window glass will not break at overpressures below 10 psf, even  when  subjected  to  repeated  booms.    However,  another  study  (Haber  and  Nakaki 1989)  found  that  regular  failures  of  good  glass  would  occur  with  psf  in  the  4-10  range and above 10 psf from sonic booms from the same direction.   A3.8.4.2.  After  window  breakage,  the  most  common  form  of  structural  damage  from vibration caused by sonic booms and artillery and tank main gun firing consists of cracks in  interior  wall/ceiling  surfaces.    A  number  of  guidelines  have  been  developed  for  the identification  and  quantification  of  damage  due  to  these  sources.    The  maximum  safe predicted  levels  (U.S.  Air  Force  1990)  for  representative  building  materials  on  interior walls and ceilings are listed in Table A3.1.  The maximum safe level has a 99.99 percent confidence that damage will not occur.  In general, it requires overpressures of 10 psf or above  for  sonic  booms  artillery  and  tank  main  gun  firing  to  cause  structural  damage  to newer or structures in very good condition.  Structural damage to structures that are older or in poor condition can occur at overpressures below 10 psf.   Table A3.1.

A3.9.  Effects of Noise on People. A3.9.1.  Annoyance.  The concept of long-term annoyance is used to account for all negative aspects  of  noise,  including  activity  interference,  including  speech  interference  and  sleep disturbance,  and  is  the  basis  for  determining  impacts  due  to  aircraft  noise  associated  with military  and  civilian  airfields.    The  best  available  source  of  empirical  dosage  effect information for predicting community response to transportation noise is the updated Schultz 58 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 Curve (Air Force Curve).  The Schultz curve was validated by the by the Federal Interagency Committee  on  Noise  (FICON)  in  1992  based  on the  additional  data  points  collected  by  the Air Force, for use by Federal agencies in aircraft noise-related environmental impact analysis and  by  the  American  National  Standards  Institute  (ANSI)  as  a  standard  on  community responses to environmental noise.   A3.9.1.1.  Since  research  studies  to  date  have  not  produced  a  process  to  accurately attribute  annoyance  responses  to  acoustic  and  non-acoustic  factors,  it  is  not  possible  to accurately  predict  annoyance  responses  to  aircraft  noise  exposure  in  any  specific community (DNWG TB2009-1)).  Percent Highly Annoyed (%HA) is not designed to be used  to  calculate  an  exact  number  of  people  in  an  ROI  and  therefore,  annoyance  is reported  as  the  change  in  the  percent  of  population  expected  to  be  highly  annoyed (%HA).  The metric DNL or DNLmr is used along with the Air Force Curve to determine the %HA. A3.9.1.2.  Correlation  between  CDNL  and  annoyance  has  been  established,  based  on community  reaction  to  impulsive  sounds  (Committee  on  Hearing,  Bioacoustics  and Biomechanics  1981).    Table  A3-2  shows  the  relation  between  annoyance,  DNL,  and CDNL. Table A3.2.  Relationship Between Annoyance, DNL and CDNL.

Speech or interference with listening due to aircraft noise can occur  in  homes,  classrooms  and  workplace  and  is  a  primary  contributor  to  long  term community  annoyance.    Frustration  and  irritation  is  often  the  result  of  aircraft  noise disrupting  routine  activities  such  as  listening  to  radio,  television  or  music,  talking  on  the phone or having a simple conversation.  The quality of speech communication is important in the classroom due to potential adverse effects on children’s learning ability.  There are two aspects  to  speech  comprehension:  word  intelligibility  and  sentence  intelligibility.    Word intelligibility is the more important of the two when it comes children’s learning.  Include a general discussion on speech interference as a contributor to annoyance in the environmental consequences section, with additional attention later in the document addressing the potential impacts  of  noise  and  speech  interference  on  children’s  ability  to  learn.    There  is  a  more AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 59 detailed  discussion  on  speech  interference  in  classrooms  in  sections  A3.9.5.1  through A3.9.5.2.  A3.9.3.  Sleep  Disturbance.  When  aircraft  operations  are  to  occur  during  environmental night  (10  p.m.  to  7  a.m.),  the  potential  for  sleep  disturbance  should  be  considered  when housing areas are located within an area where the SEL could reach 90 dB.  In 2009, DNWG endorsed  the  use  of  the  July  2008  the  ANSI  Standard  ANSI  S12.9-2008,  Quantities  and Procedures  for  Description  and  Measurement  of  Environmental  Sound  —  Part  6:  Methods for Estimation of Awakenings Associated with Outdoor Noise Events Heard in Homes.  The ANSI S12.9-2008 methodology predicts sleep disturbance in terms of percent awakenings or numbers  of  people  awakened  associated  with  noise  levels  in  terms  of  indoor  A-weighted SEL.    Sleep  disturbance  is  based  on  an  outdoor  SEL  of  90  dB,  which  corresponds  to  an indoor  SEL  approximately  25  dB  lower  (65  dB)  with  doors  and  windows  closed  and approximately 15 dB lower (75 dB) with doors or windows open (see DNWG 2009-4).  The noise level reduction provided by buildings varies with the climate.  The values of 15 dB and 25 dB are the ones typically used in  the United States and are based on  average residential construction  techniques  for  the  average  United  States  climate  (USEPA  1974).    Instructions for preparing detailed analysis can be found in Appendix 1 of DNWG TB-2009-4.   A3.9.4.  Health Effects.  The discussion of human health effects associated with noise from military operations includes both auditory health effects and non-auditory health effects.   A3.9.4.1.  Auditory  Effects.    The  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency’s Information  on  Levels  of  Environmental  Noise  Requisite  to  Protect  Public  Health  and Welfare With An Adequate Margin of Safety, (USEPA 1974) established an 8 hour Leq of 75  dB  and  a  24  hour  Leq.  of  70  dB  at  the  ear  exposure  as  levels  that  would  produce  a hearing  loss  of  less  than  5  dB  at  4000  Hertz  for  96  percent  of  the  population  over  40 years.    The  National  Academy  of  Sciences  Committee  on  Hearing,  Bioacoustics,  and Biomechanics  (CHABA)  identified  75  dB  as  the  level  at  which  hearing  loss  may  occur (CHABA 1977). A3.9.4.1.1.  Noise-related  hearing  loss  due  to  long-term  exposure  (many  years)  to continuous noise in  the work place has been studied extensively, but  there has been little  research  on  the  potential  for  noise  induced  hearing  loss  on  members  of  the community from exposure from aircraft and weapon system noise.  Unlike workplace noise, community exposure to military noise sources is not continuous, but consists of individual  events  where  the  sound  level  exceeds  the  background  level  for  a  limited time  period.    There  is  limited  data  on  the  effect  of  aircraft  noise  on  hearing.    The scientific  community  has  concluded  there  is  little  likelihood  that  the  noise  exposure from  aircraft  noise  from  civilian  airports  could  result  in  either  a  temporary  or  a permanent  hearing  loss  (Newman  and  Beattie  1985).    The  EPA  criterion  (Leq24=70 dB)  can  be  exceeded  in  some  areas  (outside)  near  airports.    Inside  buildings,  where people  are  likely  to  spend  most  of  their  time,  the  average  noise  level  will  be  much less than 70 dB.  Certain types of military aircraft (primarily fighter type aircraft) are in general much noisier that civilian aircraft, but the available data, while sometimes contradictory,  appears  to  indicate  a  similar  lack  of  significant  effects  of  noise  on hearing.  60 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A3.9.4.1.2.  There  are  only  a  few  studies  that  look  specifically  at  the  impacts  of military  jet  noise  on  noise-induced  hearing  loss.    These  included  several  studies looking  at  noise  levels  typically  produced  by  low-flying  aircraft  along  MTRs  or within  SUA/ASU,  and  one  looked  at  whether  children  who  grew  up  on  Royal  Air Force  (RAF)  bases  in  England  had  experienced  noise  induced  hearing  loss.    The studies  and  their  findings  are  summarized  in  the  Defense  Noise  Working  Group Technical Bulletin “Noise-Induced Hearing Impairment, (DNWG TB2013-2) located in the Noise Toolbox on the AFCEC/CPP SharePoint® website. A3.9.4.1.3.  According to the US EPA’s Report 550/9-74-004, Information on Levels of  Environmental  Noise  Requisite  to  Protect  Public  Health  and  Welfare  with  an Adequate  Margin  of  Safety,  (USEPA  1974)  and  U  S.  Environmental  Protection Agency  (USEPA)  Report  No.  550/9-82-105,  Guidelines  for  Noise  Impact  Analysis (USEPA 1982), populations exposed to noise greater than 80 dB DNL as being at the greatest  risk  of  potential  hearing  loss.    The  80  dB  DNL  contour  is  used  to  identify populations  at  the  most risk  of  potential  hearing  loss.    While  this  does  not  preclude populations  at  lower  exposure  levels  from  being  at  some  degree  of  risk  of  hearing loss, the estimate will be restricted to populations within a DNL of 80 dB and higher, including residents of on-base housing.  The exposure of DoD employees in the area already  defined  as  the  hazardous  noise  area  are  not  be  included  in  this  analysis because  they  fall  under  the  occupational  noise  regulations  and  are  to  be  evaluated using the appropriate DoD component regulations for occupational noise exposure. A3.9.4.1.4.  For the purposes of predicting the potential for hearing loss ( PHL) due to aircraft noise outside the workplace environment (i.e. off-base and in residential areas on  base)  in  a  NEPA  document  Potential  for  hearing  loss  (PHL)  should  be  assessed using  the  methodology  from  the  US  Guidelines  for  noise  Impact  Analysis  (USEPA 1982).    This  methodology  quantifies  hearing  loss  risk  in  terms  of  Noise-Induced Permanent Threshold Shift (NIPTS), a quantity that defines the permanent change in the  threshold  level  below  which  a  sound  cannot  be  heard.    Note  that  this  is  not  the methodology  used  by  OSHA  or  the  DoD  for  hearing  protection  in  the  work  place.  DoD  guidance  for  hearing  conservation,  audiogram  monitoring  and  hearing protection is in DoDI 6055.12, Hearing Conservation Program (HCP). A3.9.4.1.4.1.  NIPTS  is  stated  in  terms  of  the  average  threshold  shift  at  several frequencies  that  can  be  expected  from  daily  exposure  to  noise  over  a  normal working lifetime of 40 years, with exposure lasting 8 hours per day for 5 days per week.  The EPA Guidelines includes two methods to quantify the impact, hearing-weighted population (HWP) and potential hearing loss (PHL). Because potential hearing  loss  is  a  more  easily  understood  indicator,  that  is  the  indicator  used  to quantify the impact in DoD environmental analysis.  DNWG TB2013-2 describes the procedure for calculating PHL.  This calculation is not used in AICUZ studies as  the  land  use  compatibility  guidelines  states  that  people  performing  outdoor activities in the 80+ noise zone should be wearing hearing protection.  A3.9.4.1.4.2.  The  actual  value  of  NIPTS  for  any  given  person  depends  on  that individual’s physical sensitivity to noise.  Over a 40-year working lifetime, some people  will  experience  more  loss  of  hearing  than  others.  The  actual  noise exposure  for  any  person  living  in  an  area  subject  to  80  dB  DNL  or  greater  is AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 61 determined by the length of time that a person is outdoors and directly exposed to the  noise.    For  example,  noise  exposure  within  an  80  dB  DNL  contour  near  an airfield  would  be  affected  by  whether  a  person  was  at  home  during  the  daytime hours  when  most  flying  occurs.    Many  people  would  be  inside  their  homes  and therefore  would  be  exposed  to  lower  noise  levels  due  to  noise  attenuation provided by the house structure. A3.9.4.2.  Non-Auditory  Health  Effects.    Current  research  regarding  the  potential  for non-auditory  health  effects  should  be  acknowledged  in  NEPA  documents.    As  noted  in DNWG  TB-2013-3,  and  The  Airport  Cooperative  Research  Project  (ACRP)  Synthesis Report  #9,  “Effects  of  Aircraft  Noise:  Research  Update  on  Selected  Topics”  (ACRP 2008), and much of the  current research concludes that is  not  yet  possible to  determine causal or consistent relationship between health disorders and aircraft noise exposure.   A3.9.5.  Aircraft  Noise  Effects  and  Children.  Discussions  about  the  impact  of  aircraft noise on children generally include discussions related to children’s learning and may include a discussion on physiological effects.  A3.9.5.1.  Classroom  Speech  Interference.    There  have  been  a  number  of  studies  about the effects of noise (road traffic and aircraft noise) on learning.  A major European Union study,  the  Ranch  study,  investigated  the  relationship  between  aircraft  and  road  traffic noise  exposure  at  schools  and  learning  in  multiple  countries.    The  study  found  a  linear relationship  between  exposures  to  aircraft  noise  and  impaired  reading  comprehension, while road noise did not in this particular study effort.  Although this study represents an improvement  on  previous  studies  due  to  the  large  number  of  participants  and  schools across  several  countries,  the  study  did  acknowledge  that  the  study  did  have  limitations.  Speech  interference  due  to  noise  can  also  impact  a  student’s  ability  to  comprehend lessons.    In  classrooms,  speech  communication  between  teacher  and  student  is  the primary  activity  sensitive  to  noise  intrusion  from  aircraft.    In  order  for  students  to understand unfamiliar words and concepts, it is essential for students to hear clearly every word  spoken  by  the  teacher.    Children  are  not  as  familiar  with  language  as  adults  and therefore  may  miss  some  of  the  verbal  cues  and  redundancies,  which  aid  adults  in communication.  For this reason, background noise levels should be lower for children to achieve  the  same  level  of  speech  comprehension  as  adults.    Details  on  evaluating  the potential for speech interference in classrooms can be found in DNWG TB2013-4 located in   https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home.   the  Noise  Toolbox  on  AFCEC/CPP’s  SharePoint®  site: A3.9.5.2.  Physiological  Effects.    There  has  been  some  limited  investigation  on  the potential physiological and auditory effects of aircraft noise on children.  A review of the literature  found  that  studies  include  examination  of  blood  pressure  levels,  hormonal secretions,  and  hearing  loss.    As  a  measure  of  stress  response  to  aircraft  noise,  authors have looked at blood pressure readings to monitor children’s health.  Some studies have shown that children who were chronically exposed to aircraft noise experienced increases in blood pressure, significant increases in stress hormones, and a decline in quality of life (Evans et al. 1998).  Others studies have shown that children attending noisy schools had statistically  significant  higher  average  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  (p<0.03) (Cohen  et  al.  1980).  Studies  investigating  hormonal  levels  between  groups  of  children exposed to aircraft noise compared to those in a control group demonstrated that were no 62 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 differences between the children exposed to aircraft-noise and the control groups (Haines et  al.  2001b  and  2001c).    Other  studies  have  reported  hearing  losses  from  exposure  to aircraft noise (Chen  et  al. 1997, Chen and Chen 1993).  The one study to look  at  noise induced hearing loss in  children due  to  military  aircraft noise is  summarized in  DNWG TB-2013-2.  There is additional information on studies looking at noise induced hearing loss and children in paragraph A3.9.4.1.2.    A3.10.  Noise Effects on Animals.  Amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals are the terrestrial wildlife species that are evaluated for impacts, with a focus on the species of greatest concern or interest.    Among  these  are  Special-Status  Species,  which  are  defined  as:    1)  federally  listed animal species that are protected under the Endangered Species Act (Public Law 93-205); and 2) other special-status species, including state‐ listed species that are not federally listed, and other species  of  special  concern  identified  by  state  and  federal  agencies.    Game  species  may  also  be species of interest  if hunting is  a major economic activity or there  are populations that hunt  as their major source of food (e.g. subsistence lifestyle). A3.10.1.  The  effects  of  aviation  noise  on  animals  (both  wild  and  domesticated)  have  been studies extensively over the last 25 or so years, with much of the early work being conducted by Air Force sponsored researchers.  The studies revealed that the effects are highly species dependent  and  the  degree  of  the  effect  may  vary  widely.    Responses  of  animals  to  aircraft noise vary from almost no reaction to virtually no tolerance of sound therefore it is difficult to generalize animal responses to military jet overflight and sonic boom noise disturbances or to draw inferences across species.  Analysis of potential impacts to terrestrial species requires an  investigation  of  available  literature  on  the  species  in  question,  nature  of  the  proposed action,  and  coordination  with  affected  governmental  agencies  having  jurisdiction  and expertise in this area.   A3.10.2.  Quantitative criteria for animal health have not been established by the Air Force. Determining  whether  the  proposed  action  is  compatible  with  a  particular  animal  requires investigating  available  literature  on  the  species  in  question  and  coordination  with  affected governmental  agencies  having  jurisdiction  and  expertise  in  this  area.    The  Air  Force  has conducted  studies  to  determine  the  effects  of  military  aircraft  noise  on  many  species;  the results of those studies should be used to the extent practicable to define effects on animals.  Whenever  there  is  a  potential  to  affect  a  special  status  species,  consultation  with  either  the USFWS or NMFS is required. A3.10.3.  The  effects  of  noise  from  aircraft  overflights  are  difficult  to  assess  because  a number of adaptive responses may be involved, making the overt behavioral or physiological changes  in  response  to  noise  highly  variable.    These  responses  include  the  acoustic  startle, the  orienting  response,  and  other  species  typical  and  individual  strategies  for  coping  with novelty,  species-typical  defensive  behaviors,  and  responses  conditioned  by  previous exposures  to  noise.    In  addition,  the  type  of  aircraft  (e.g.,  fixed  wing  versus  rotor-wing [helicopter]) and type of flight mission may also produce different levels of disturbance, with varying animal responses (Smith et al. 1988).  A3.11.  Effects  on  Cultural  and  Historic  Resources.  Cultural  and  historic  sites  include archaeological sites, structures and buildings, historic districts, and cultural landscapes protected under  various  laws  and  regulations.    Potential  impacts  to  cultural  and  historic  resources  from noise  include  audible  intrusions  affecting  the  setting  of  cultural  and  historic  resources  and AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 63 damage  from  noise-induced  vibrations  from  sonic  booms.    Noise  measurements  for  assessing noise  impacts  to  historic  sites  include  both  A-weighted  and  C-weighted  noise  metrics  such  as DNL  (or  Ldnmr)  for  subsonic  flight  operations  and  CDNL  for  the  sonic  booms  generated  by supersonic flight operations. A3.11.1.  The  standard  DNL  metrics  can  be  supplemented  with  discussions  on  the  from current  activities  and  proposed  conditions  as  well  as  the  increases  in  the  frequencies  of overflights with noise measured in SEL (SELr) and the frequency of sonic booms are used to assess  impacts  associated  with  noise  intrusions.    Generally  noise  intrusions  only  apply  to those  situations  where  the  historic  setting  or  context  is  a  character-defining  feature  of  the significance  of  the  site  or  where  quiet  is  an  essential  component  of  a  traditional  cultural property.  A3.11.2.  Historic  sites  include  both  archaeological  sites  that  date  to  the  period  after European contact as well as buildings and structures.  Noise generated by low altitude, high-speed  aircraft  does  not  affect  archaeological  sites  or  structures  except  under  specific instances  such  as  where  the  noise  affects  the  historic  or  traditional  setting  or  where  sonic booms occur in areas with historic structures in poor condition. A3.11.3.  In general, prehistoric and historic archaeological sites lacking standing structures are generally ground surface or even subsurface deposits that would not be affected by noise induced  vibrations  or  noise  intrusions.    Some  prehistoric  archaeological  sites  could  contain natural  structures  such  as  rock  shelters  or  caves,  which  may  contain  petroglyphs  or pictographs etched or painted onto the rock surfaces.  However, studies have found that these types of natural formations are not affected any more by noise vibrations form sources such as  from  sonic  booms,  than  by  natural  erosion,  wind,  or  seismic  activity  (Battis  1983).    In situations where these sites are considered traditional use areas or sacred areas and are visited for ceremonies, then impacts due to noise intrusions may occur.   A3.11.4.  Culturally sensitive areas and sites refer to traditional or sacred areas or other areas where  setting  and  context  is  a  critical  part  of  the  importance  of  the  site  or  is  a  character defining feature of its eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (e.g., Little  Bighorn  Battlefield).    For  sites,  districts,  or  landscapes  where  the  historic  setting  is important, the introduction of a noise source not currently occurring in the area may have an adverse  effect.    Noise  impacts  to  American  Indian  traditional  cultural  resources  may  be related  to  interference  with  ceremonies  and  other  traditional  activities  at  sacred  sites.  Undisturbed  habitats,  resources,  and  settings  are  considered  to  be  critical  to  religious practices (NPS 1994).  Potential impacts can be identified only through consultation with the affected groups. A3.12.  Socio-Economic  Effects  of  Noise.  Socioeconomic  impacts  are  assessed  in  terms  of direct  effects  on  the  local  economy  and  population  and  related  indirect  effects  on  other socioeconomic resources within the ROI.  Changes in noise due to a proposed action could also potentially affect  property  values.  However, many factors (e.g., economic opportunities, ready access  to  the  airport,  and  status  of  the  neighborhood)  affect  property  values.    The  majority  of studies on property values and noise have looked at changes in property values in the vicinity of commercial  airports  not  military  installations.    Existing  property  value  studies  should  be reviewed to identify their limitations and assess whether there is a need for a  study in the area around the base in question.   64 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A3.13.  Reducing the Noise Effects.  Modifying the noise source, the path the noise travels, or the receiving location of the noise can reduce noise levels  and associated effects.   This  section briefly  reviews  the  options  for  reducing  noise.    More  information  on  these  strategies  can  be found   https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home. the  Noise  Toolbox  on  AFCEC/CPP’s  SharePoint®  site: in A3.13.1.  Modifying  the  receiving  location  can  require  facility  engineering  solutions  or relocating  the  people.    Unlike  the  FAA’s  Part  150  program  which  is  funded  through passenger  fees,  the  Air  Force  is  funded  through  Congressional  authorizations  and appropriations and does not have the authority to spend appropriated funds to sound attenuate or modify buildings that the Air Force does not own or control.  The Air Force can add sound attenuation  to  buildings  on the base.   The  relocation of people in  high noise zones is  a last resort because of the cost and the disruption to people’s lives and the community.  The Air Force  AICUZ  program  encourages  communities  to  avoid  locating  future  residential development in high noise zones; however, it is not designed to address situations in which changes  to  Air  Force  operations  change  the  noise  levels  for  areas  that  were  previously compatible. A3.13.2.  Modifying the path that the noise travels is most applicable for ground based noise sources.    Some  examples  of  reduction  strategies  include  the  use  of  barriers,  roadway configuration,  the  use  of  enclosures  for  point  sources  of  noise,  and  attenuation  through distance or acoustic site design.  The only path modification that is appropriate for addressing aircraft  noise  is  moving  the  flight  tracks,  or  in  some  cases  increasing  the  altitude,  however increasing the altitude may have unintended consequences.  While increasing the altitude of an aircraft may slightly decrease the noise level underneath the plane it may actually increase the  area  on  the  ground  exposed  to  the  aircraft  noise.    Never  assume  increased  altitude  will reduce the noise impact.   Always consult  with  an acoustician or confirm through modeling the proposed operational changes before making any changes. A3.13.3.  The most common method for reducing noise is to modify the source because this is  within Air Force control.  There are two primary ways to  reduce noise at  the source:   1) technology  changes  such  as  design  modifications,  which  actually  reduces  the  “amount”  of noise emanating from  a  source, e.g. quieter  engines, new types of  aircraft,  and 2) changing how the aircraft or weapon system is used.  The second method does not necessarily reduce the  absolute  level  of  noise  generated  by  the  aircraft  or  weapon  system  but  can  reduce  the level  of  noise  at  a  receiving  location.    Table  A3.6  provides  an  overview  of  methods  for reducing noise at the source that are within the Air Force’s control.  A3.13.4.  .    Identification  and  implementation  of  noise  reduction  techniques  that  involve changing how aircraft and weapon systems are operated requires a comprehensive planning and  evaluation,  and  involvement  of  the  proponent  of  the  action,  pilots,  airspace  managers, testing  and  training  personnel  if  necessary.    Modifications  should  always  consider  and minimize  any  negative  impacts  to  training  or  other  mission  activities.    Additionally,  when reducing noise by modifying the source or path, it is important to recognize that the proposed technique may result in the noise simply shifting from one area to another.  Changes to flight operations can result in new impacts that will need analysis in the NEPA document, and the changes may result in a new alternative that needs to be fully evaluated.   AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 65 A3.13.5.  Mitigations based on changes to operations committed to in a Record of Decision, or  are  the  basis  of  a  Finding  of  No  Significant  Impact,  a  mitigation  and  monitoring  plan  is required.    When  the  term  monitoring  is  used  in  relationship  to  noise  impacts  analyzed  in  a NEPA document it is not referring to noise monitors or meters, it is referring to verifying that the  whether  the  aircraft  is  being  operated  consistent  with  how  the  Air  Force  described  and modeled  its  operations.    For  aircraft  this  type  of  monitoring  involves  verifying  that  the operations conducted once the action is implemented is consistent with the information used in the modeling to predict of noise levels.  Validate flight tracks, flight profiles, and types of flight operations using the NMODD developed for the noise analysis in the NEPA document and  checking  it  against  how  the  aircraft  are  actually  being  operated  to  see  if  there  are  any differences.    If  there  are,  additional  modeling  may  be  necessary  to  determine  whether  the DNL  levels  are  noticeably  different  (in  the  range  of  3  dB  DNL  or  more)  than  originally predicted.  If this is the case, a supplemental NEPA analysis may be needed.   A3.13.6.  The strategies used to reduce impacts to animals will depend on the type of animal and the environment in which it is found as well as the intensity and frequency of the noise.  If there is a potential for noise to affect federally listed species, measures to reduce those the effects will be developed through consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and/or National  Marine  Fisheries  Service  (NMFS).    During  consultations  on  reducing  impacts  to species  of  interest,  minimizing  impacts  to  the  Air  Force  mission  remains  a  priority.  Mitigation of noise impacts on animals is typically be done through the creation of seasonal or temporal avoidances that minimize or eliminate noise during the breeding and/or nesting season; scheduling training and other noise-generating activities to minimize noise exposure during  the  most  active  time  of  day/night  for  a  particular  species  of  concern  or  during migration  or  wintering  periods.    Another  method  is  to  create  physical  avoidance  areas  or “bubbles”  around  areas  where  animals  are  known  to  live.    This  can  typically  be  done  by lateral offsets or increase in flight altitudes for aircraft. A3.13.7.  The strategies to reduce noise impacts to cultural or historic properties will depend on  the  type  and  location  of  the  resource  or  type  of  property  affected  (i.e.,  structure,  sacred sites,  etc.).    Noise  (audible)  intrusions  and  damage  to  historic  properties  are  recognized  as examples of adverse effects under the law that governs the Protection of Historic Properties (36 CFR 800.5(a)(2)).  If the Air Force determines that noise generated by their activities has the potential to adversely affect historic properties, then consultation with the State Historic Preservation  Officer  and/or  Tribal  Historic  Preservation  Officer  is  required.    During consultations  on  reducing  impacts  to  cultural  or  historic  properties,  minimizing  impacts  to the Air Force mission remains a priority.     66 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 Table A3.3.  Methods for Reducing Weapon System Noise. Noise Source Aircraft Maintenance Aircraft Flight Activity Supersonic Aircraft Activity (Sonic Booms) [Note that the sonic boom is formed in front of the aircraft] Artillery and Bombs  Methods to Reduce Noise Impacts Locate high-power engine runs away from noise sensitive areas.  Increase buffer areas.  Maximize use of hush-houses and test cells.  Limit engine runs between the hours of 10 p.m. (2200) and 7 a.m. (0700).  Limit engine run times when atmospheric conditions will likely cause increase noise complaints.  Change flight paths to avoid noise sensitive areas.  Designate a preferential runway during calm winds that minimizes overflight of noise sensitive areas.  Create permanent, seasonal or event-related avoidance areas.  Maximize use of reduced-thrust take-offs.  Adjust altitude profiles.  Minimize flights between the hours of 10 p.m. (2200) and 7 a.m. (0700).  Build sound attenuation into new construction.    Change flight patterns.  Limit activity to higher altitudes.  Avoid supersonic airspeeds when approaching or directly overflying noise sensitive and populated areas.  Avoid sharp turns before structures and near towns.  If a turn must be executed do so either after passing or at the very edge of any town.   Change the orientation of weapons release (bombs).  Change locations of firing points (artillery).  Increase buffer areas.(both)  Minimize training between the hours of 10 p.m. (2200) and 7 a.m. (0700). (both)  Limit training when atmospheric conditions will likely increase noise complaints. (both) AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 67 Attachment 4 THE ROLE OF COMMUNICATION AND COMPLAINT MANAGEMENT  A4.1.  Public  Outreach  and  Communication  Open  communication  with  the  public  about  an installation’s  noise  sources  is  a  critical  component  of  a  successful  noise  program.    By maintaining  a  dialog  with  the  public  through  publications  and  electronic  news  media,  the installation  can  help  improve  the  public’s  understanding  of  the  sound  generated  from  military activities and what  the installation is  doing to  minimize it.  Often, when a community believes the installation is acting as a ‘good neighbor,’ the annoyance level of the public decreases which often  means  that  complaints  are  reduced.    These  lines  of  communication  also  provide  a mechanism  for  the  pubic  to  educate  the  installation  personnel  about  their  noise  concerns.    It  is important to understand that given the subjective nature of noise i.e. unwanted sound, that even the most robust communication strategies may not always change the public’s opinion about the noise, however without any communications, the public’s opinion may become more negative.   A4.1.1.  Communicating  with  the  Public.    The  installation  PA  typically  takes  the  lead  in these when it comes to communicating with the public, but other members of the installation staff maybe needed to assist in developing the messages and have a role in delivering these messages.    It  is  vitally  critical  that  all  messages  about  noise  generating  activities  be developed  in  coordination  with  the  Installation  Public  Affairs  (PA)  Office(r)  as  detailed  in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 35-101, Public Affairs Policies and Procedures and AFI 35-108, Environmental Public Affairs. A4.1.2.  Managing Public Expectations.  People who live near military installations typically become  familiar  with  routine  military  operations  and  sounds  in  their  surrounding environment and have expectations as to what levels of noise they will hear and when they will  hear  it.    A  change  to  noise  generating  activities  often  creates  uncertainty  in  people’s minds  and  often  results  in  an  increase  in  inquiries  or  complaints.    Notifying  the  public through  press  releases  or  other  outreach  methods  in  advance  of  any  changes  to  normal operations (i.e., training exercises, air shows) resets the public’s expectations (i.e. establishes a  new  “norm”)  of  what  they  will  hear  and  when.    Experience  has  proven  that  advance notification  typically  minimizes  the  inquiries  and  complaints.   This  requires  open communication  across  installation  organizations  to  ensure  all  appropriate  offices  associated with the activities and with noise related responsibilities are working with the Public Affairs office. A4.1.3.  Tools.  The use of brochures or fact sheets providing general background on the installation, its mission, major noise sources, and contact information can be helpful outreach tools.  These brochures can be provided to a variety of stakeholders and can be an effective public awareness tool for local engagement activities, such as civic or local government meetings, news coverage, or base tours.  Social media provides an additional communication tool.  Examples of brochures and fact sheets and other communication tools are in the Noise Toolbox on AFCEC/CPP’s SharePoint® site:  https://afcec-portal.lackland.af.mil/cp/cpp/em/SitePages/Home. A4.2.  Education of Installation Personnel.  Before engaging the public, installation personnel should  ensure  they  understand  local  noise  concerns  and  are  ready  to  respond  to  them  if necessary.    Training  of  installation  personnel  should  include  information  on  communicating 68 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 about  noise  focusing  on  establishing  trust  and  credibility  with  the  public  based  on  primary messaging that is open and honest and conveys empathy.  Facts and figures such as Day-Night Average  Sound  Level  (DNL)  contours,  noise  levels  of  individual  noise  events  (i.e.,  Maximum Sound Level (Lmax) or Sound Exposure Level (SEL)), number of people exposed may be difficult for  the  general  public  to  understand  and  should  be  considered  as  secondary  messaging.  AFCEC/CPP  can  provide  noise  focused  specific  risk  communication  training  for  talking  to  the public about noise. A4.3.  Handheld Sound Level Meters.  Easy-to-use, publicly available technology such as low-cost  sound level  meters  and sound meter application software developed  for downloading onto any smart phone present an increasing challenge when members of the public begins to  collect measurements and dispute documentation published by the Air Force.   A4.3.1.  Handheld  sound  level  meters  are  not  designed  to  discriminate  between  sources  of noise  and  often  report  results  in  metrics  other  than  those  being  disputed  (i.e.,  disputing  a noise  level  present  on  a  DNL  contour  map  with  a  Lmax  reading).    Note  that  DNL  contours cannot be validated using handheld sound level meters.  Installation personnel should be able to  explain  the  difference  between  noise  metrics  used  by  the  Air  Force  and  measurements from the sound level meters.   A4.3.2.  When the public raises an issue based on the use of handheld sound level meters, or if  the  complainant  appears  to  be  experienced  in  the  acoustic  environment,  installation personnel should consult with personnel who have an in depth understanding of noise metrics and  sound  level  meters  for  assistance.    These  include  the  installation  Bioenvironmental Engineer, or AFCEC/CPP.   A4.4.  Noise Inquiries  and Complaints.  Not all phone calls or emails about military noise are complaints.    Many  times  people  will  call  or  email  with  an  inquiry  about  a  noise  event  (e,g, questions  about  an  unusual  noise  event  and  what  caused  it).    Complaints  may  be  non-specific, and  result  when  there  is  an  accumulation  of  issues  that  have  finally  risen  to  a  level  that  an individual feels they need to make their concerns known to the installation, or they may be about a specific noise event.  There are typically two types of callers/writers: 1)  those individuals that call  routinely  let  the  installation  know  that  they  are  not  happy  with  about  the  noise  or  other activities,  and  2)  those  that  call  occasionally,  typically  when  there  have  been  changes  to operations,  or  about  a  specific  type  of  activity  that  is  generating  noise.    It  is  important  to distinguish  between  inquiries,  and  complaints  and  the  type  of  callers/writers  in  order  to  take advantage of any information that the caller or writer may be able to provide.    A4.4.1.  Documenting  Noise  Inquiries  and  Complaints.  Documenting  all  noise  inquiries and complaints makes it easier to inform the Commander of public concerns.  It is important for the installation commander to be briefed on noise complaints and inquiries so responses can  be  prepared  and  possible  mitigations  explored  and  implemented  if  necessary.    Many installations  have  a  phone  number  or  hotline  dedicated  to  noise  inquiries  and  complaints.  Installation  personnel  should  treat  all  callers  with  respect  and  integrity  and  assure  the individual that a detailed log of their complaint is being recorded and will be reported to the installation commander.  It may not always be possible to answer all calls in real time.  Calls received  but  not  answered  directly  by  installation  personnel  (i.e.,  after  hours)  should  be addressed  within  24  hours.    When  documenting  noise  inquiries/complaints  gather  as  much information from the caller about an event or issue as possible because it will make it easier AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 69 for  installation  staff  to  identify  trends  and  patterns,  see  paragraph  A4.4.2.4  for  more information.  Some bases have their own protocols for the information collected from callers, but for those that don’t, Table A4.1 provides the minimum data that should be collected.  Table A4.1.  Noise Inquiry and Complaint Log Information. Identifying Information Name of Installation Personnel Recording Complaint: Date: Questions to Ask Caller 1)How did the noise affect the caller (e.g., startled, interfered with conversation, interfered with ability to hear television or radio, vibrations)? 2)Was there any damage as a result of the event? Caller Name, Address, Phone Number: 3)How many times did the disturbance occur Location (physical address) of the caller and/or location at time of incident: Date and time the incident occurred: Source of the Noise (e.g., aircraft, explosion, sonic boom, vehicle) and has it occurred in the past? 4)How long did the disturbance last? 5)Is there any other information about the noise disturbance?  6)What were the weather conditions during the time of the incident (e.g., temperature, wind conditions, rainy or dry, hot, humid)? A4.4.2.  Responding  to  Inquiries  and  Complaints.  The installation’s public affairs office has  the  lead  for  handling  these  inquiries  and  complaints;  however,  input  from  other installation  organizations  is  often  required.    No  matter  who  is  responding  to  the inquiries/complaints, the responses should be as consistent as possible.  The installation and community  relationship  is  based  on  the  public’s  understanding  that  the  Air  Force  takes  all noise  complaints  seriously  and  works  to  adjust  operations  whenever  possible  as  long  as  it doesn’t create negative impacts on testing and training activities.   A4.4.2.1.  After  the  noise  inquiry  or  complaint  is  logged,  the  incident  should  be investigated with the appropriate Air Force agency.  Wing Operations should review all complaints, and when appropriate, the responsible flight  or range squadron notified and any deviations from standard procedures identified.  A4.4.2.2.  In  order  to  promote  “good  neighbor”  practices,  installation  personnel  may choose  to  meet  with  the  complainant  or  invite  them  to  visit  the  installation  to  improve community relations.  Effective complaint management and response requires installation personnel  to  be  courteous  and  interested  in  the  complainant’s  noise  concern.    In  some circumstances, there may already be accurate information concerning the noise event that has  occurred;  if  so,  installation  personnel  should  provide  a  brief  explanation  to  the complainant.   70 AFI32-7070  21 APRIL 2016 A4.4.2.3.  Installation personnel should always follow-up with the complainant after the installation commander has reviewed the information and the responsible flight or range squadron has been contacted to determine the source of the noise.  Personnel may provide supplementary  information  and  an  explanation  of  the  noise  event,  if  necessary.    If changes  were  implemented  because  of  the  noise  inquiry  or  complaint,  installation  PA should  follow-up  with  the  complainant  to  determine  if  the  issue  of  concern  has  been resolved.   A4.4.3.  Identifying  Patterns  and  Trends.  Data  from  noise  inquiries  or  complaints provides  for  can  be  used  to  identify  patterns/trends,  problem  areas,  or  planning  future mitigation of noise concerns.  The noise program manager should retain records a minimum of five years.  Maintaining records over a period of years allows the installation to maintain accountability  and  monitor  flight  patterns  and  weapon  system  use  which  result  in considerable public inquiry or complaints.   A4.4.3.1.  By evaluating and understanding these patterns, installation personnel may be able  to  identify  strategies  to  mitigate  noise  in  areas  in  the  surrounding  community  or sensitive  locations.    With  the  use  of  technologies  such  as  GIS,  the  installation  can  map noise  inquiries  or  complaints  with  existing  noise  contours  that  extend  outside  the installation  and  more  easily  relate  location  of  complaints/inquiries  and  flight  tracks (departures,  arrivals,    pattern  work),  and  identify  possible  changes  in  flight  operations that might mitigate the public concerns.   A4.4.3.2.  Data  from  complaints  can  also  be  used  to  conduct  additional  analysis  on  the type flight operations to determine if the operational data used to create the existing noise contours  should  be  re-evaluated  to  determine  if  a  change  in  aircraft  operations  has occurred resulting in a large number of complaints.
