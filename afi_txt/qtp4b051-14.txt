Ask the individual whether he/she has had previous (or is currently receiving) exposure to ionizing radiation prior to registering into the program from working as a radiation worker outside the Air Force. 2.  If yes, request any previous exposure reports.1 3.  Use The Radiation Dosimetry Web secure server to enroll the individual.2  DISENROLLING FROM THE DOSIMETRY PROGRAM: 1.  Determine if the dosimeter was worn during the monitoring period.3 2.  Complete the Personnel Information Change form using The Radiation Dosimetry Web and indicate the individual should be removed. 3.  At the end of the monitoring period, submit all dosimeters for the individual(s) removed from the program to USAFSAM/OEA.   LOCAL REQUIREMENTS: Ensure that an enrollee meets the following conditions: -  Received training on proper wear and storage of TLD’s -  Knows where to find exposure results and get help in understanding his or her individual exposure? (BE) -  Articulates that if he or she exceeds applicable occupational exposure limits while moonlighting that he or she may be removed from their AF radiation specific duties?  (signed acknowledgement letter) -  Received ALARA training -  Received training on radiation work while pregnant (applicable to females only)   NOTES: 1.  AF Form 1527-2, Cumulative History of Individual Occupational Exposure to Ionizing Radiation, from the Radiation Dosimetry Laboratory (for exposure from an Air Force installation) or a NRC Form 4, Occupational Radiation Exposure History or equivalent (from the individual's employer) 2.  The following information must be gathered prior to logging into the website:      a. Area      b. Name (last, first, middle initial)      c. SSAN      d. Gender      e. TLD Type      f.
