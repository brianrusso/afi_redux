 BY ORDER OF THE  SECRETARY OF THE AIR FORCE  AIR FORCE PAMPHLET 32-2004 25 SEPTEMBER 2014 Civil Engineering AIRCRAFT FIRE PROTECTION FOR EXERCISES AND CONTINGENCY RESPONSE OPERATIONS COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PUBLICATION IS MANDATORY ACCESSIBILITY:  Publications and forms are available for downloading or ordering on the e-Publishing website at: http://www.e-publishing.af.mil. RELEASABILITY:  There are no releasability restrictions on this publication.  OPR:   AFCEC/CXF  Supersedes:   AFPAM32-2004, 21 April 2010 Certified by: AF/A7CX  (Lt Col James Griffin) Pages: 15   This  pamphlet  provides  planners  guidance  for  contingency  response  operations  lasting  a maximum  of  120  days.    Planners  use  this  guidance  to  determine  the  minimum  number  of  Fire Emergency  Services  (FES)  aircraft  rescue  and  fire  fighting  (ARFF)  manpower  and  vehicles necessary to provide fire suppression for Air Force (AF) aircraft during major exercises and real world  contingencies.    These  operations  may  include  exercises  for  training  purposes,  disaster response,  humanitarian  relief  operations,  or  other  non-combat  type  operations.    Determining requirements is based on the type and size of aircraft being protected.  For the purposes of this document, applicable AF ARFF vehicle sets and requirements are found in Allowance Standard (AS)  010,  Vehicle  Fleet  (Registered)  All  MAJCOM  Common,  and  are  based  on  National  Fire Protection  Association  (NFPA)  Standard  403,  Aircraft  Rescue  and  Fire  Fighting  Services  at Airports, and AF NFPA 403, Technical Implementation Guide.  These sets are used as a baseline and  modified  to  meet  exercise  and  contingency  requirements.    The  capabilities  outlined  in  this pamphlet  provide  ARFF  fire  suppression  and  limited  rescue  capability,  but  do  not  include structural  fire  protection  or  other  emergency  response  capabilities.  This  guidance  applies  to  all AF Active, Reserve, and Air National Guard (ANG) Civil Engineer (CE) units.  Ensure that all records  created  as  a  result  of  the  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are  maintained  in accordance  with  (IAW)  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of  Records,  and disposed of IAW the AF Records Disposition Schedule  located at https://www.my.af.mil/gcss-af61a/afrims/afrims.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  document  has  been  substantially  revised  and  must  be  completely  reviewed.  This  revision addresses  changes  contained  in  Air  Force  Instruction  (AFI)  32-2001,  Fire  Emergency  Services (FES) Program and provides consistency with WMP 1. 1.  Scope.  This pamphlet provides guidance for operations lasting a maximum of 120 days and is  used  for  small  scale  operations.    It  does  not  apply  to  long  term  ongoing  operations  or  wars.  FES  guidance  for  those  requirements  is  found  in  AFI  32-2001  and  WMP  1,  CE  Supplement, Appendix 5. 2.  Responsibility.  The  aircraft  user  provides  ARFF  capability  at  locations  other  than established AF installations.   If the aircraft user  cannot  provide the minimum  ARFF capability listed  in  Table  1,  the  user  should  request  support  through  Air  and  Space  Expeditionary  Force Operations or the aircraft provider’s Major Command (MAJCOM) Director of Operations (DO).  In this case the user may also be responsible for providing funding. 3.  Risk  Management  (RM).  Fire fighting capability is dependent on three primary resources:  fire fighting vehicles, agent, and personnel.  The assumption is that only one major fire incident will  occur  at  a  time.    This  document  approaches  RM  from  a  perspective  of  requiring  the  local risk managers to determine the acceptable levels  of risk based on local risk factors.  Generally, local risk factors include historical fire experience (if available) and the type and duration of the operation.    Refer  to  Air  Force  Pamphlet  (AFPAM)  90-803,  Risk  Management  Guidelines  and Tools, for guidance on conducting a risk assessment. 3.1.  The maximum length of time this document covers is 120 days in any one-year period. For  operations  that  exceed  120  days,  arrangements  must  be  made  for  permanent  FES capability  as  prescribed  in  AFI  32-2001  (permanent  installations)  or  WMP  1  (deployed locations). 3.2.  In principle, the shorter the exposure time, the lower the risk.  Theoretically, operations of  very  short  duration  present  lower  risk  than  operations  approaching  120  days.    This exposure time should be a factor when determining the FES resources required. 3.3.  ARFF  capability  is  dependent  on  vehicles,  agent  and  personnel  available  to  conduct operations  at  an  incident  scene.    Capability  for  each  primary  resource  (vehicles,  agent  and personnel)  is  described  as  Optimum  Level  of  Service  (OLS),  Reduced  Level  of  Service (RLS), Critical  Level of Service (CLS) or  Inadequate Level of Service (ILS).  Overall FES capability  is  the  lowest  level  of  service  available  for  either  resource.    For  example,  when agent is OLS and personnel are CLS, the overall capability is CLS. 3.4.  The  fundamental  purpose  of  fire  fighting  operations  is  to  save  lives  and  property.  Therefore,  the  resources  necessary  to  deliver  the  various  levels  of  service  are  calculated based on scenarios that may be encountered.  OLS is  the highest  level  of service providing the capability to perform rescue from a large fire (exterior and interior) involving an aircraft.  Resources  are  provided  to  knockdown,  extinguish  or  control  the  exterior  fire  and  fight interior  fires  enabling  rescue  to  be  performed.    OLS  provides  the  highest  probability  of AFPAM32-2004  25 SEPTEMBER 2014   3  success.  Conversely, if CLS is provided fire crews would not be expected to perform rescue from  a  large  fire  scenario.    They  may  be  successful  in  extinguishing  a  small  fire  on  one side/one location or perform rescue from a fighter-type aircraft.  However, these operations would have to be prioritized since they would not have capability to perform these operations simultaneously. 3.5.  Saving lives is the primary objective.  The probability of saving property diminishes as the fire grows.  Fire crews focus on early intervention so they can intervene in time to avoid major  damage.    When  early  intervention  does  not  occur  it  is  not  always  possible  to  save property. 4.  Planning Guidance.  Local risk managers determine the quantity of agent required based on the risk assessment discussed in paragraph 3 above.  The quantities discussed in this document may  be less  than that available at a permanent  installation due to  the short  exposure time (less than 120 days). 4.1.  The  amount  of  agent  required  is  based  on  the  type  and  size  of  aircraft.    Aircraft  are grouped into 6―ARFF Vehicle Sets described in Table 1.  Fire fighting agent is delivered by ARFF  vehicles  with  capacities  of  500,  1,000,  1,500,  3,000  or  3,300  gallons.    Table  1 indicates the quantity of agent required for various levels of service.  Ideally the quantity of agent  required  to  provide  OLS  should  be  provided;  however,  for  short-duration  operations RLS or CLS may be provided with the appropriate notices to Airmen and waivers. 4.1.1.  The Fire Chief or Senior Fire Officer (SFO) should discuss the risk associated with each level of service with the Commander and ensure the risk they are accepting is fully understood. 4.1.2.  OLS is when all authorized resources are available for emergency response within response  time  standards.  OLS  provides  sufficient  capability  for  quick  response  and sustained operations after arrival on scene. During OLS, emergency response forces shall accomplish all objectives when responding to emergency incidents. 4.1.3.  RLS  is  when  the  Emergency  Response  Capability  (ERC)  is  less  than  OLS  but greater than CLS. Sufficient capability is provided for initial response, scene assessment and  implementation  of  mitigation  tactics.  This  level  of  service  represents  increased risk/loss potential due to lack of ERC to perform rescue and sufficient mitigation tactics simultaneously.  FES  objectives  may  not  be  successful  during  situations  where simultaneous rescue and fire fighting activities are required. 4.1.4.  CLS capability exists when 7 firefighters are available to respond to an emergency within the response time standards. Upon arrival, the Incident Commander will determine the appropriate actions to be taken depending upon their initial evaluation of the situation. Successful  outcomes  can  only  be  expected  when  the  incident  can  be  quickly  mitigated. Firefighters are expected to revert to defensive operations when the emergency cannot be quickly contained. This level of service represents limited rescue capability and increased risk/loss  potential  due  to  limited  resources.  Due  to  exhaustion  and  resource  limitations, CLS  is  considered  a  “one  shot”  capability  that  cannot  be  sustained  for  more  than approximately 15 minutes.   4  AFPAM32-2004  25 SEPTEMBER 2014 4.1.5.  ILS  capability  represents  an  amount  of  agent  less  than  CLS  and  the  property involved in fire is expected to be destroyed.  Except at fires in the incipient stage, entry for fire fighting purposes is not permitted. 4.2.  Regardless  of  available  manpower,  CLS  agent  in  Table  1  represents  increased  risk  to aircrews and reduces the probability that the fire can be extinguished. The RLS column is a safer  alternative  and  provides  increased  capability.  CLS  is  the  minimum  level  of  agent acceptable and should be limited to very short duration operations. This level of protection is necessary before operations begin. 4.3.  See Attachment 2 for actual Department of Defense (DoD) Aircraft Quantity (Q)1, Q2, and Q3 Factor Calculations.  Actual Q Factor Calculations should also  be considered when developing RM plans or making risk-based decisions.  For more information regarding RM see AFI 32-2001. Table 1.

FES  planners  should  select  the  largest  vehicles  available  to  minimize  the  number  of drivers required to operate them. 4.5.  Recommend 6 firefighters per operational period with two P-19s or Rapid Intervention Vehicle  (RIV)s  for  contingency  airfields  supporting  Category    1  Remotely  Piloted  Aircraft (RPA) operations.  The absence of a rescue requirement warrants the reduced capability. AFPAM32-2004  25 SEPTEMBER 2014   5  4.6.  Installation  or  deployed  Commander,  Air  Force  Forces  should  consult  with  the MAJCOM or Area of Responsibility (AOR) Fire Chief to establish capabilities for operations not addressed in this document. 4.7.  A minimum of two ARFF vehicles are recommended for all locations in case of vehicle failure. 4.8.  Required agent may be provided in water tankers so long as at least one ARFF vehicle with turret capability is also provided. 4.9.  When  operating  at  locations  with  multiple  types  of  aircraft  the  largest  aircraft determines the ARFF requirement. 4.10.  When  the  required  fire  fighting  capability  is  temporarily  not  available  due  to unavoidable circumstances for periods more than 72 hours, the Fire Chief will develop a RM plan and provide it to the responsible Commander for their review and approval. 5.  Personnel  Requirements.  The  previous  paragraphs  discussed  the  fire  fighting  agent required.  This section addresses the manpower necessary to accomplish tasks in order to achieve OLS, RLS and CLS. 5.1.  Note: The personnel numbers listed in Table 1 would constitute firefighters working 24 hours a day/7 days a week.  If flying operations increase, personnel numbers listed in Table 1 may  need  to  be  increased.    The  Fire  Chief  or  SFO  will  determine  how  firefighters  will  be utilized. 5.2.  If structural fire protection is required, consult with the AOR or MAJCOM Fire Chief to provide appropriate structural fire protection requirements.  This can be provided by adding structural fire fighting vehicle(s).  Cross-manning (staffing) should be used to minimize the need for additional personnel. 6.  Exceptions.  The  responsible  commander  may  exclude  fire  protection  for  infrequent  flying operations including: 6.1.  USAF Vehicle Sets 1 through 3:  Not more than four takeoffs and four landings within seven consecutive days. 6.2.  USAF Vehicle Sets 4 through 6:  Not more than two takeoffs and two landings within seven consecutive days. 6.3.  AFI  11-299,  Nuclear  Airlift  Operations,  requires  a  minimum  of  one  AF  P-19  or equivalent and manpower for locations where aircraft carrying special weapons are operated, loaded  or  unloaded.    This  is  required  regardless  of  the  number  of  takeoffs  and  landings occurring. 7.  Waivers.  When protection capability is at or below CLS, the airlift provider MAJCOM/DO or  ANG/DO  must  grant  waivers  for  operations.  For  exercises  and  contingency  operations,  the Director of Mobility Forces  and the Joint Force Air Component Commander  must waive ARFF requirements.    When  time  does  not  permit  formal  (written)  waiver  action,  the  MAJCOM/DO (waiver  authority)  files  an  after-action  summary.    The  MAJCOM/DO  provides  information copies of all waivers to the MAJCOM Fire Protection Office.  A waiver shall include: 7.1.  Date(s) and type of operations.   6  AFPAM32-2004  25 SEPTEMBER 2014 7.2.  Type aircraft involved. 7.3.  Description  of  available  ARFF  assets  to  include  dedicated  manpower,  amount  of  fire fighting agent available, and number of ARFF vehicles. 7.4.  Mission  Impact  Statement.  A  mission  impact  statement  must  accompany  all  waiver requests. NOTE:  No  waiver  is  required  for  the  first  aircraft  in  and  the  last  aircraft  out  carrying  ARFF equipment.
