Mission Description.  En Route Care (ERC) includes all elements of medical care, support, treatment,  staging  and  transport,  from  the  point  at  which  a  request  for  movement  has  been received,  through  the  final  destination  for  definitive  care.    Aeromedical  Evacuation  (AE) provides time-sensitive ERC of regulated casualties to and between medical treatment facilities (MTF),  using  organic  and/or  contracted  aircraft  with  medical  aircrew  trained  explicitly  for  this mission.    AE  forces  can  operate  as  far  forward  as  aircraft  are  able  to  conduct  air  operations, across the full range of military operations, and in all operating environments.  Specialty medical teams may be assigned to work with the AE aircrew to support patients requiring more intensive en  route  care.    The  goal  is  to  match  patient  needs  with  the  appropriate  skills,  knowledge, equipment, and infrastructure to enable safe, effective, and efficient ERC. 1.2.  Purpose.  This AFI provides ERC documentation guidelines to promote continuity of care for Department of Defense (DoD) beneficiaries and designees.  Information presented in this AFI sets Air Force requirements for health record documentation in the ERC environment, and is not intended to be used as a substitute for sound clinical judgment. 1.3.  Applicability.  This AFI applies to all AE unit-assigned or associated ERC personnel, and all Active Duty, Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) and Air National Guard (ANG) medical units. 1.4.  Publication  Administration.  This  AFI  should  be  available  to  all  active  duty,  AFRC  and ANG  personnel  assigned  to  AE  units,  Critical  Care  Air  Transport  Team(s)  (CCATT),  ERPSS and Specialty Medical ERC Transport teams. 6 AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

Health  record  documentation  is  hand  written  or  electronically generated patient information obtained through a clinical process.  Health record documentation is  a vital  component of  safe,  ethical  and  effective clinical  practice, regardless of the context  of practice  or  whether   Health  record documentation should reflect the application of clinical knowledge, skills and judgment, as well as  the  patient’s  perspective.    Health  record  documentation  should  establish  accountability, promote quality and continuity of clinical care.  Health records are legal documents. is  paper-based  or  electronic. the  documentation 3.2.  General Considerations. 3.2.1.  Documentation provides a chronological record and may be used in court or during an investigation  to  assist  with  testimony,  reconstruct  events,  establish  times  and  dates,  and  to substantiate  and/or  resolve  conflict.    Health  record  documentation  should  provide  specific information (when, where, who, what, how and why) about the planning for and provision of a patient’s treatment. 3.2.2.  The  person  reading  a  health  record  document  assumes  the  person  who  is  doing  the recording  provided  the  care  or  service  to  the  patient.    The  provider  or  clinician  who performed  or  observed  the  intervention/event  with  the  patient  should  document  the  health record information. 3.2.3.  Documentation should be completed as soon as possible after care is provided. 3.2.4.  Events should be documented in chronological order. 3.2.4.1.  When it is not possible to document concurrently or within a reasonable time of the event, a late entry or addendum is required.   3.2.4.2.  Late  entries  for  paper  and  electronic  documentation  start  with  the  words “Addendum.”    Include  the  events,  and  reference  the  date  and  time  events  actually occurred as well as the date and time the Addendum was prepared. 3.2.5.  When  two  or  more  licensed  clinicians  are  caring  for  the  same  patient,  each  licensed clinician will document and sign for their care provided and/or services rendered. (T-0). 3.2.5.1.  Unless  otherwise  stated  in  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  policy,  when  both licensed and non-licensed clinicians are caring for the same patient, a privileged provider or licensed clinician will review and co-sign the non-licensed clinician’s documentation. (T-0). 3.2.5.2.  The privileged provider or licensed clinician must co-sign within the same shift or mission. (T-0). 3.2.6.  Designated recorder.  During an emergency situation, it may be necessary to designate a recorder.  The designated recorder should: 3.2.6.1.  Document  chronological  events,  procedures,  interventions,  and  frequency  of care implemented. AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 13 3.2.6.2.  List  all  who  were  present  and  their  designation/qualifications  during  the emergency, such as Registered Nurse/Physician. 3.2.6.3.  The  designated  recorder  will  provide  the  documentation  to  the  person  assigned to the patient for review and co-signature or concurrence. (T-0). 3.2.7.  All entries on a paper-based system will be documented using black or blue ink. (T-3).  Do not use pencil, felt pens or highlighters as the information could be changed and/or does not copy or scan clearly. (T-3). 3.2.8.  A  single  line  drawn  through  any  blank  or  “white  space”  should  be  used  to  maintain sequential documentation and prevent erroneous entries. 3.2.9.  Patient Privacy.  Regardless of the method used to communicate patient information, all clinicians will adhere to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 standards. (T-0). 3.2.9.1.  The  following  statement  will  be  included  within  the  email  or  on  the  facsimile coversheet (T-0): 3.2.9.2.  “NOTICE:  This document may contain information covered under the Privacy Act,  5  USC  552(a),  and/or  the  Health  Insurance  Portability  and  Accountability  Act (PL104-191)  and  its  various  implementing  regulations  and  must  be  protected  in accordance  with  those  provisions.  Healthcare  information  is  personal  and  sensitive  and must be treated accordingly. If this correspondence contains healthcare information it is being  provided  to  you  after  appropriate  authorization  from  the  patient  or  under circumstances that don't require patient authorization. You, the recipient, are obligated to maintain  it  in  a  safe,  secure  and  confidential  manner.  Redisclosure  without  additional patient consent or as permitted by law is prohibited.  Unauthorized redisclosure or failure to  maintain  confidentiality  subjects  you  to  application  of  appropriate  sanction.  If  you have received this correspondence in  error, please notify the sender at once and destroy any copies you have made.” 3.2.10.  Health record documentation should provide comprehensive information concerning the  condition  of  the  patient  or  clinical  care  provided.    Documentation  should  be  clear, complete  and  accurate  to  facilitate  quality  assurance  and  quality  improvement  initiatives.  Clinical  documentation  will  be  specific,  using  measurable  data  if  possible,  and  avoid generalizations. (T-0). 3.2.11.  All  patients  will  be  identified  using  at  least  two  unique  identifiers,  e.g.,  patient’s name and date of birth. (T-0). 3.2.12.  If pseudonyms and identifiers are used, these identifiers will match the demographics used during clinical documentation. (T-0). 3.2.13.  During  regulated  patient  movement,  all  patients  should  be  identified  using  the TRANSCOM Regulating and Command & Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) ID band prior to enplaning. 3.2.14.  All  time  documented  in  the  health  record  will  be  in  Zulu  or  Zulu  equivalent  (T-1).  All  EHR documentation devices will have their  system time set  to  Zulu  or  Zulu  equivalent (T-1). 14 AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 3.2.15.  When appropriate, health record data will incorporate scalable information, e.g., pain 8/10. 3.2.16.  Clinicians  will  use  the  DoD  and  U.S.  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  Pain Rating Scale, Figure 3.1, IAW United States Army Institute of Surgical Research (USAISR) Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  for  adults.  (T-1).    Clinicians  may  continue  to  use  the  Wong-Baker  FACES  Pain  Rating  scale,  Figure  2.,  for  pediatric  patients.    Clinicians  may  use  the Faces  Legs  Activity  Cry  Consolability  (FLACC)  scale,  Table  3.1,  for  patients  who  are unable to communicate their pain. Figure 3.1.  (DoD / VA Pain Rating Scale)  . Figure 3.2.  (Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale)  .   AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 15 Table 3.1.  FLACC Pain Assessment Tool.

How to use the FLACC.                                     3.2.17.1.1.  In  patients  who  are  awake:    Observe  for  1  to  5  minutes  or  longer.  Observe legs and body uncovered.  Reposition patient or observe for activity.  Assess body for tenseness and tone.  Initiate consoling interventions if needed. 3.2.17.1.2.  In  patients  who  are  asleep:    Observe  for  5  minutes  or  longer.    Observe body  and  legs  uncovered.    If  possible,  reposition  the  patient.    Touch  the  body  and assess for tenseness and tone.  WARNING:  This scale should not be used on patients undergoing neuromuscular block. 3.2.17.1.3.  FACE:  Score 0 if the patient has a relaxed face, makes eye contact  and shows interest in surroundings.  Score 1 if the patient has a worried facial expression, with eyebrows lowered, eyes partially closed, cheeks raised mouth pursed.  Score 2 if the patient has deep furrows in the forehead, closed eyes, an open mouth, deep lines around nose and lips. 3.2.17.1.4.  LEGS:    Score  0  if  the  muscle  tone  and  motion  in  the  limbs  are  normal.  Score  1  if  the  patient  has  increased  tone,  rigidity,  or  tension;  if  there  is  intermittent flexion or extension of the limbs.  Score 2 if the patient has hypertonicity, the legs are pulled tight; there is exaggerated flexion or extension of the limbs, tremors. 3.2.17.1.5.  ACTIVITY:    Score  0  if  the  patient  moves  easily  and  freely,  normal activity or without restrictions.  Score 1 if the patient shifts positions, appears hesitant to  move,  demonstrates  guarding,  a  tense  torso,  and/or  when  pressure  is  applied  to  a body part.  Score 2 if the patient is in a fixed position, rocking; demonstrates side to side head movement or rubbing of a body part. 16 AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 3.2.17.1.6.  CRY:  Score 0 if the patient has no cry or moan, awake or asleep.  Score 1 if the patient has occasional moans, cries, whimpers, sighs.

Score  1  if  the  patient  responds  to  comfort  by  touching  or  talking  in  30 seconds  to  1  minute.    Score  2  if  the  patient  requires  constant  comforting  or  is inconsolable. 3.2.18.  The  FLACC  pain  scale  was  designed  for  children  between  the  ages  of  2  and  7; however, this pain scale can be used on adults.  The FLACC total scores indicate: 3.2.18.1.  Zero (0), the patient is relaxed. 3.2.18.2.  One to three (1-3), the patient is experiencing mild discomfort. 3.2.18.3.  Four to six (4-6), the patient is experiencing moderate discomfort. 3.2.18.4.  Seven to ten (7-10), the patient is experiencing severe discomfort.  3.2.19.  Clinicians should document objective facts  about  observations and assessments and should only document conclusions supported by data. 3.2.20.  Subjective  data  from  third  parties  may  be  included  as  long  as  the  individual  is identified and the statements made are annotated within quotation marks. 3.2.21.  Health record notations will include the date, time (Zulu), signature, and designation of  the  individual.  (T-0).    Personal  initials  and  signature  may  be  used,  if  a  signature  log  is used.   NOTE:  A signature log may be located in the medical record and consist of at least one signature clearly related to a printed name and designation of the individual. 3.2.22.  Health  record  documentation  reflects  a  clinician  has  fulfilled  his/her  duty  of  care.  Any clinically significant information should be documented such as: 3.2.22.1.  Clear, concise statement of patient status. 3.2.22.2.  Assessment data. 3.2.22.3.  All ongoing monitoring and patient communication. 3.2.22.4.  Any care or interventions provided. 3.2.22.5.  An evaluation of patient outcomes to include the patient’s response. 3.2.22.6.  Patient education and assessment of the patient’s understanding. 3.2.22.7.  Any plans for follow up. 3.2.22.8.  Any unanticipated, unexpected or abnormal incidents such as falls, medication errors,  clinical  emergencies  or  undesired  responses  to  clinical  care.        NOTE:    “Near miss”  reporting  is  a  separate  process  used  to  track  and  mitigate  patient  safety  events.  Near miss reporting is not part of a clinical record; therefore, clinicians will not include a DD  Form  2852,  Aeromedical  Evacuation/Near  Miss  Report,  in  the  patient’s  record  and will not reference completion of a DD Form 2852 within the patient’s record. (T-0). 3.2.23.  Cross  referencing  health  record  information.  Health  record  documentation should be captured electronically when the capability exists.  If health record documentation AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 17 is  captured  both  electronically  and  on  paper,  clinicians  should  reference  the  paper  source within the electronic document. 3.2.23.1.  Example:  If an electronic health record is used to document pain scales and an AF  Form  3899I,  Medication  Administration  Record,  is  being  used  to  document  pain medication  delivery,  clinicians  will  chart  pain  scales  in  the  electronic  health  record  and may add an electronic note stating “see AF Form 3899I for medication delivery times.” (T-3). 3.2.24.  Clinicians  will  avoid  using  problematic  abbreviations  as  detailed  in  The  Joint Commission’s in  Table 3.2.  (http://www.jointcommission.org/topics/patient_safety.aspx or as updated)   (T-0). “Do  Not  Use” official list as listed Table 3.2.  DO NOT USE ABBREVIATION LIST. 1. Do Not Use U (unit) 2. Potential Problem Mistaken for “0” (zero), the number “4” (four) or “cc” 3. Use Instead Write “unit” IU (International Unit) Mistaken for IV (intravenous) or the number 10 (ten) Write “International Unit” Q.D., QD, q.d., qd (daily) Q.O.D., QOD, q.o.d.,  qod (every other day) Mistaken for each other Period after the Q mistaken for “I” and the “O” mistaken for “I” Write “daily” Write “every other day” Trailing zero (X.0 mg) Decimal point is missed Lack of leading zero (.X mg) Write X mg Write 0.X mg MS MSO4 and MgSO4 Can mean morphine sulfate or magnesium sulfate Confused for one another Write “morphine sulfate” Write “magnesium sulfate” 3.2.25.  Dates  will  be  documented  using  the  following  formats,  (DD  MMM  YY  or YYYYMMDD). (T-3). 3.2.26.  Errors  should  be  corrected  as  soon  as  possible.   When  correcting  paper documentation,  the  original  content  will  remain  visible  and  retrievable  so  the  purpose  and content of the correction is clearly understood. (T-0).  Failing to correct errors properly may be interpreted as falsification of a record. 3.2.27.  For  paper  documentation,  clinicians  will  cross  through  the  errors  with  a  single  line and insert “void” with their initials. (T-0). 3.2.28.  For errors made in electronic documentation, refer to the TMIP-AF user guide on the EHR  computer  desktop  image.    Comments  specific  to  medication  administration  are  final and cannot be modified.  Narrative notes can be edited and updated at a later time. 3.3.  Privileged Provider Orders. 3.3.1.  Unsigned  privileged  provider  orders  are  not  valid  orders  in  the  AE  system.    Orders will have either a wet or electronic signature. (T-1). 3.3.2.  Ground UTC nurses may take verbal orders from privileged providers for emergency cases only. 18 AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 3.3.3.  In  the  physical  absence  of  a  privileged  provider,  flight  nurses  may  take  telephone orders from a privileged provider at alert time or during mission execution for emergency or routine  clinical  situations.    The  entire  order  must  be  annotated  as  Read  Back  (RB)  and verified with the privileged provider prior to the nurse signing the order and proceeding. (T-0). 3.3.4.  Verbal/Telephone  orders  will  require  the  privileged  provider  to  make  an  EHR  entry stating  the  date,  time,  and  what  the  verbal/telephone  order  was  once  the  patient’s  AE encounter is closed.  (T-1). This entry can be accomplished through TMDS. 3.3.4.1.  Verbal/telephone  orders  will  be  annotated  as  follows  (T-1):  “date,  time  (Zulu), verbal/telephone  order  from  (printed  first  name,  middle  initial,  and  last  name  of privileged  provider),  printed  first  name,  middle  initial,  and  last  name  of  nurse  taking order, rank, signature of nurse.”   3.3.4.2.  “Verbal order” may be spelled out or abbreviated as “V/O.” 3.3.5.  Privileged provider orders  will be legible.  (T-0).   All  orders will  be followed by the author’s name (printed or typed first name, middle initial, and last name), date, time (Zulu) and  signature.  (T-1).    Electronic  signatures  are  authorized.    Using  privileged  provider signature stamps is highly recommended.  3.3.6.  Privileged  provider  orders  should,  at  minimum,  include  patient’s  diet,  activity,  and pertinent medication and treatments as applicable. 3.3.7.  For  paper  documentation.    If  an  error  is  made,  line  through  or  discontinue  the  order and annotate with date, time and initials or signature.  Paper orders will not be edited in any other manner. (T-0). 3.3.7.1.  When  discontinuing  an  order,  the  discontinued  order  will  be  lined  through  and annotated  with  “D/C”  or  “DC”,  date,  time,  and  initials  of  person  discontinuing  or transcribing the order. (T-0). 3.3.7.2.  If  the  discontinue  order  was  transcribed  or  transferred  to  another  form,  the medication  or  treatment  will  be  lined  through  and  annotated  with  (“DC”,  “D/C”  or “Discontinued”),  date,  time,  and  initials  of  person  annotating  the  order.  (T-0).        NOTE:    The  annotations  “D/C”  and  “DC”  will  only  be  used  as  an  acronym  for discontinue or discontinued. (T-2). 3.3.8.  For  electronic  documentation,  discontinue  incorrect  order  and  replace  with  a  correct order. 3.3.9.  Only  active  privileged  provider  orders  will  be  obvious  on  the  order  sheet,  patient treatment  sheet  and  /  or  medication  administration  records.  (T-0).                      WARNING:  AHLTA-T does not  automatically notify staff when a new order is  written and needs to  be transcribed or scheduled.  Likewise, writing or changing a privileged provider order does not mean  staff  acknowledgement  of  new  or  changed  orders.    Clinicians  writing  orders  will communicate  new  orders WARNING:   Early versions  of AHLTA-T do not  have the ability to  annotate when orders are verified, acknowledged and transcribed.  Clinical staff will review paper and electronic orders at minimum once per shift and should document “Orders Reviewed” with date, time and  signature  on  paper  progress  notes  or  document  using  Add  Note  and  free  text  “Orders to  clinical  staff  via the  most  reliable  method.  (T-1).            AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 19 Reviewed”  within  an  AHLTA-T  encounter.  (T-1).    Checking  an  “Orders  Reviewed” checkbox  within  an  AHLTA-T  alternate  input  method  (AIM)  form  is  also  acceptable.                  WARNING:    The  electronic  medication  administration  record  module  must  be  open  when discontinuing  a  medication  to  ensure  the  discontinued  order  is  annotated  in  the  patient’s encounter.  (T-3).Refer to TMIP-AF user guide.            WARNING:  When an electronic order  for  a  medication  is  submitted,  the  privileged  provider  must  ensure  the  order  is “dispensed”  to  ensure  proper  transcription.  (T-1).  Refer  to  TMIP-AF  user  guide.                   NOTE:  When using the AHLTA-T, nurses will use Add Note and type “V/O” per privileged provider’s first name, middle initial, and last name then reference the order as free text.  (T-1).  If verbal order is for a medication, document the order in the medication module.  Refer to TMIP-AF user guide. 3.4.  Order Transcription. 3.4.1.  Transcribing an order signifies an order has been reviewed, understood and transferred to nursing patient care forms. 3.4.2.  Clinicians  will  note  order  transcriptions  by  annotating  the  date,  time,  printing  the words “Noted” or “Transcribed,” along with the date, time, printed name and signature of the person transcribing the order. (T-0). 3.4.3.  If a nurse takes a verbal  order and transcribes the same order, the  nurse will include the words “V/O and Transcribed.” (T-1). 3.5.  Trip Segment. 3.5.1.  AECMs will document a trip segment as the first clinical entry for each mission.  (T-2). The trip segment will include (T-2):  date of flight, enplaning station  deplaning station.  Example:  20130820 Andrews AFB, MD  Scott AFB, IL.   3.5.2.  On mission legs 45 minutes or less, International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) codes for enplaning / deplaning stations may be used.  Example:  20130820 KADW  KBLV. (T-3). 3.6.  Aircraft  Emergency.  In  the  event  of  an  aircraft  emergency  leading  to  any  patient intervention, documentation will include, but is not limited to: type of aircraft emergency, cabin altitude  pre/post  emergency,  clinical the  patient’s  condition  post intervention(s). (T-1). interventions,  and 3.7.  Patient and Attendant Briefings. 3.7.1.  Pre-flight briefings.  AECMs should complete preflight briefings prior to taxi. 3.7.2.  Documentation to annotate a pre-flight briefing occurred should be in accordance with (IAW)  AFI  11-2AE  Vol  3,  Aeromedical  Evacuation  (AE)  Operations  Procedures, attachment 2, Aeromedical Evacuation Crew Member Expanded Checklist, and annotate the patient/attendant’s level of understanding. (T-2). 3.8.  Focus-DART Charting. 3.8.1.  Focus-DART  charting  is  a  systematic  approach  to  documentation,  using  medical terminology  to  describe  the  patient’s  health  status,  interventions,  treatments  and  patient education.  At a minimum, documentation should focus on abnormal findings and significant negative findings.  Documentation should include focus, data, action, response and teaching 20 AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 elements as applicable.  Individuals should adopt the principles of focus charting when using electronic media. 3.8.2.  Focus:  patient’s issue or concern; abnormal or significant negative finding(s). 3.8.3.  D-Data:  When applicable, include subjective and/or objective information related to the stated focus or describing observations at the time of significant events. 3.8.4.  A-Action:    When  applicable,  include  patient  interventions  or  treatments  performed, and/or protocols and procedures initiated. 3.8.4.1.  Clinicians should document planned interventions or treatments discussed during plan of care conferences. 3.8.4.2.  Doing so not only assists with daily planning of interventions and treatment, but also  assists  the  Patient  Movement  Requirements  Center  (PMRC)  with  evacuation planning. 3.8.5.  R-Response:    When  applicable,  include  a  description  of  a  patient’s  response  to medical and/or nursing care.  Response elements could state plan of care outcomes have been attained or are progressing toward attainment. 3.8.6.  T-Teaching:    When  applicable,  include  a  description  of  patient  education  performed and an assessment of the patient’s understanding. 3.9.  Minimum Documentation.  For AECMs, minimum documentation for missions with flight times less than 45 minutes will include (T-1): 3.9.1.  An  assessment  of  any  immediate  patient  concerns  and  interventions,  and  a reassessment of interventions and/or treatments. (T-1). 3.9.2.  Vital  signs,  oximetry,  pain,  sedation,  and  temperature  as  indicated  by  patient diagnoses/assessment findings/privileged provider orders. (T-1). 3.9.3.  Any abnormal respiratory findings to include respiratory adjuncts as indicated. (T-1). 3.9.4.  Suicidal  or  homicidal  ideations  for  psychiatric  patients  or  other  diagnoses  as applicable. (T-1). 3.9.5.  Assessment  of  circulation,  motor  and  sensory  checks  for  patients  with  restraints  or with other restrictive/constrictive devices. (T-1). 3.10.  Patient Staging Personnel. 3.10.1.  Patient staging personnel will chart as clinically indicated, upon admission and upon discharge/transfer. (T-1).  3.10.2.  Inpatients will be charted on at least once per shift, and outpatients will have an entry at least every 24 hours. (T-1). 3.11.  Patient Handoff. 3.11.1.  Patient handoff is essential to continuity of care and risk mitigation.  Clinicians must use the Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment and Recommendation (ISBAR) patient handoff  format  during  patient  handoff,  as  outlined  in  AFI  48-1XX,  vol  1,  Aeromedical Evacuation Medical Operations. (T-2). AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 21 3.11.2.  Patient handoff tools should not be placed in the medical record. 22 AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 Chapter 4 AEROMEDICAL EVACUATION PAPER DOCUMENTATION 4.1.  General Principles: 4.1.1.  Patient records are tailored for each patient based on condition and treatments needed during patient  movement.  The AF Form 3899, Patient  Movement Record, will be required for  entry  into  the  aeromedical  evacuation  system.    Additional  AF  Form  3899  series documents  will  be  used  to  document  a  patient’s  care  during  AE  transport.    The  referring facility should be aware of available AF Form 3899 series documents and expand the use of these  tools  as  patient  needs  require.    When  used,  the  AF  Form  3899  series  documents become a part of the permanent medical record. (T-1). be found at can 4.1.2.

General guidelines as outlined in Chapter 3 apply to the electronic health record.  5.1.2.  Clinicians  and  privileged  providers  may  chart  by  exception  in  the  EHR  system, consistent with applicable standards. 5.1.3.  Signature  logs  are  not  required  for  EHRs  that  do  not  contain  paper  documentation; however,  a signature log will accompany the  record if the record consists of electronic and paper documentation/charting. (T-2).  See 3.2.15. 5.1.4.  When  documentation  is  contained  in  both  paper  and  electronic  health  records.    The paper document should be referenced in the EHR. 5.2.  AHLTA-T Specific Considerations. 5.2.1.  AHLTA-T  users  and  super  users  will  be  responsible  for  proper  utilization  of  the system to the level of their training proficiency levels. (T-2).  See Attachment 2 for training requirements and proficiency codes. 5.2.2.  Entering and Reviewing AE EHR Information. 5.2.2.1.  Entering patient data into the ERC EHR can be done in two ways: 5.2.2.1.1.  Either through the creation of an AHLTA-T encounter or 5.2.2.1.2.  Embedding  scanned  paper  documentation  in  an  AHLTA-T  encounter  or TMDS record. 5.2.2.2.  Reviewing  AE  electronic  patient  information  can  be  done  in  three  ways.    By reviewing  an  AHLTA-T  encounter  if  the  information  has  been  transferred  from  one AHLTA-T system to another.  By reviewing a patient’s record in TMDS.  By reviewing information  transferred  through  the  common  data  registry  (CDR)  into  AHLTA (Garrison). 5.2.2.3.  See NOTES under  A2.3.2 and A2.3.3.1.3. 5.2.3.  Patient demographic information and disposition. 5.2.3.1.  Do not alter patient demographics when patients are already in the Authoritative Data  Source  (ADS)  or  information  has  been  transferred  on  portable  media.    If demographics are incorrect, contact the TMIP-AF help desk ASAP.  TMIP-AF will make the changes.  See WARNING under A2.5.2.10.2.4. 5.2.3.2.

The  AE  EHR  system  will  consist  of  four  parts:    Computer  hardware,  software applications,  an  expeditionary  framework,  and  a  data  management  infrastructure  capable  of operating in the en route care environment. (T-1). A2.2.  The support contact number/information to update hardware/software will be maintained on every AE EHR opening screen. (T-1). A2.3.  Software Development. A2.3.1.  The  intuitiveness  of  software  design  will  be  a  high  priority  during  software  design and testing in order to minimize user training requirements. (T-1). A2.3.2.  The current  AE EHR system uses the theater configuration of AHLTA-T to  gather data  from  clinicians.    NOTE:    AHLTA-T  software  is  a  store  and  forward  system.  Information generated by one AHLTA-T system can only be accessed by another AHLTA-T system if the file(s) created during an encounter is moved along with the patient flow through the AE system.  Encounters may be reviewed after obtaining a TMDS account via this link:  https://tmds.tmip.osd.mil/portal. A2.3.3.  Software  will  have  the  capability  for  gathering  comprehensive  objective  and subjective patient data after an encounter is created. (T-1). A2.3.3.1.  The encounter will be saved as a file on the local system. (T-1). A2.3.3.1.1.  Once  the  encounter  is  signed  by  an  authorized  clinician,  AE  EHR software will automatically place the data in queue. (T-1). A2.3.3.1.2.  Once  an  internet  connection  is  established,  data  will  be  condensed, encrypted and automatically forwarded to TMDS within 30 minutes. (T-1). A2.3.3.1.3.  Data forwarded to TMDS will be batched and sent to the CDR within 24 hours. (T-1).         NOTE:  Due to the delay in data flow from TMDS to the CDR, receiving  clinicians should  use a current  instance of AHLTA-T or TMDS to  review patient care encounters recorded in the expeditionary and/or ERC environment. A2.3.3.1.4.  Data  will  be  digitized  with  the  ability  to  be  visually  interpreted  by clinicians, sorted, and queried for metrics, quality analysis, process improvement and research. (T-1). A2.3.4.  Software  programs  will  be  developed  for Environmental factors include: (T-1). the  unique  ERC  environment.  A2.3.4.1.  Lack of continuous en route connectivity and limited bandwidth. A2.3.4.2.  Requiring  a  system  capable  of  gathering,  storing,  and  forwarding  patient information  to  another  instance  of  AHTLA-T,  TMDS  and  the  CDR  when  external connectivity can be established. A2.4.  Updated hardware and software user manuals will be available for use by personnel in the AE system and will include at a minimum: (T-2). AFI48-307V3  12 APRIL 2016 39 A2.4.1.
