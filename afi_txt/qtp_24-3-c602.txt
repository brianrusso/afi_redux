Boom and outriggers must be in the stowed position while the truck is in motion.  5.5.3.  Operation of boom controls and PTO.  5.5.3.1.  From the bucket.  5.5.3.2.  From the turret.  5.5.3.3.  Limitations:  Maximum capacity of the bucket and wench, emergency hydraulic pump time limits, positioning the truck on a slope, maximum voltage boom and platform will withstand.  See manufacturer’s operator’s manual.  5.5.4.  Downhill operation.  5.5.4.1.  Always descend hills with extreme care,  relying  primary on the  engine  braking effect to  control vehicle speed.  5.5.4.2.  Observe the following precautions:  5.5.4.2.1.   Never coast downhill.  5.5.4.2.2.   Service  brakes  alone  should  not  be  used  to  control  speed  on  major downgrades.    5.5.4.2.3.   Brakes will fade from overuse. 5.5.4.2.4.   Downhill speed is controlled by removing one’s foot from the accelerator pedal  and putting the transmission/rear axle in reduced gear.   5.5.4.2.5.   Do NOT attempt to gear down if the engine has reached maximum speed (revolutions per minute (rpm)) in  any gear range since it will be impossible to shift into a lower gear and could result in possible  vehicle runaway, property damage, personal injury, or death.  5.5.5.  Split brake system.  5.5.5.1.  The truck is equipped with a split brake system.  5.5.5.2.  The  purpose  of  this  split  system  is  to  provide  a  means  of  stopping  the  vehicle should a  failure occur in either the primary or secondary brake system.   In the event air pressure loss  occurs in one  system,  the  remaining  system continues to provide  braking action.  5.5.5.3.  Even though there will be enough braking capability for emergency stopping, the vehicle  must  not  be  operated  when  a  failure  in  indicated,  as  there  is  no  means  of replenishing air  pressure  5.5.5.4.  If vehicle has been parked for an extended period in cold weather, always check to be  sure all wheels are rolling free (brakes are not frozen) when starting out.  Always clean  accumulated ice and snow from brake linkage.  5.5.5.5.  Never operate the vehicle when insufficient air pressure (less the 70 pounds per square inch (psi)) is  indicated for either system since the volume of air required to stop the vehicle may be greater  than that available.   5.5.6.  Brake application.  5.5.6.1.  Rapid successive brake applications and release sometimes  referred to as fanning or pumping the pedal, should be avoided.  This is an inefficient way of  slowing or stopping a vehicle and inefficient use of air pressure.  5.5.7.  Parking.  5.5.7.1.  Parking brake.  5.5.7.1.1.   All  vehicles  with  air  brakes  are  equipped  with  spring  brake  chambers  for parking.  The  parking system is operated manually by a single valve, which in the case of a tractor also  controls the parking system on the trailer.  5.5.7.1.2.   The purpose of this brake is to hold the vehicle in a parked position and to assist in  bringing it to an emergency stop.  The parking brake should not be used to stop the  vehicle during normal driving.  5.5.7.1.3.   To apply the parking brake, pull out control.  To release the parking brake, push in  control.    5.5.7.1.4.   If  air  pressure  is  reduced  to  approximately  20  psi  to  45  psi  in  both  the primary and secondary systems, the parking brake control will automatically apply. 5.5.7.1.5.   It  should  be  noted  that  upon  loss  of  air  pressure  partial  spring  brake application will  occur prior to automatic application of the control valve 5.5.7.1.6.   To release, recharge system to 70 psi and push parking brake control.  5.5.7.2.  Parking brake indicator light.  5.5.7.2.1.   The park brake indicator is operated in  conjunction with the parking brake.  With the key on and the park brake set, the park light will  illuminate.  If the light does not illuminated with the park brake set, the indicator may be  defective.  5.5.7.2.2.   Warning  – Driving with  the parking brakes applied can lead to  excessive heat  buildup,  resulting  in  possible  properaty  damage,  personnel  injury,  and  possible death.  5.5.7.3.  When parking on the flightline, always leave the key in the ignition.  5.5.7.4.  When parking off the flightline, never leave the key in the ignition.  5.5.8.  Reservoir moisture draining.  5.5.8.1.  Moisture taken in with the air through the compressor inlet valves collects in the reservoirs and necessitates draining each reservoir.  5.5.8.1.1.   Daily in cold weather.  5.5.8.1.2.   Once a week in warm weather.  5.5.8.2.  This is done by opening the drain cock located either on the bottom of the tank or in the  end of the tank.  If the drain cock is opened in the end of the tank, there must be some air  pressure in the system to assure proper drainage.  Be sure to close the drain cocks after all  moisture has been expelled.  5.5.8.3.  On vehicles so equipped, the reservoir automatic drain valve ejects moisture and contaminants  from  the  reservoir  in  which  it  is  connected.    It  operates  automatically  and requires no manual assistance or control lines from other sources.  The reservoir should  be drained and the valve should be examined periodically to ensure that the drain passage  is not obstructed.    5.5.9.  Aerial Lifts.  5.5.9.1.  Aerial  lifts  are  electrically  isolated  buckets,  which  are  often referred  to  as insulated buckets.   Aerial lifts must be constructed to  meet ANSI/SIA  A92.2.,  Vehicle-Mounted Elevating and Rotating Work Platforms.  5.5.9.2.  Operation  of  aerial  lift  equipment  near  energized  electrical  facilities.    Qualified electrical workers may operate aerial lift equipment between the approach distances  and the working distances given in Figure 5.1, if all of the following conditions are met.  Figure 5.1.  Qualified Worker Minimum Working Distances.    5.5.9.3.  A job safety analysis (JSA) / job hazard analysis (JHA) has been completed.  5.5.9.4.  The  activity  is  being  performed  under  the  direct  supervision  of  a  designated person who is trained and competent in this type of work.  5.5.9.5.  The distances between energized parts and the aerial lift equipment is monitored while the aerial lift equipment is being moved and or repositioned  5.5.9.6.  The aerial lift equipment is grounded.  5.5.9.7.  No  one,  other  than  necessary  workers,  is  within  3  meters  (10  feet)  of  the equipment during its operation.  Workers are to perform their work while on the equipment, not from a position on the ground.  5.5.9.8.  Types of aerial lifts:  5.5.9.8.1.   Extendable boom platforms.  5.5.9.8.2.   Aerial ladders.  5.5.9.8.3.   Articulating boom platforms. 5.5.9.8.4.   Vertical towers.   5.5.9.8.5.   A combination of any of the above.   5.5.9.9.  Manufacturers.  5.5.9.9.1.   Aerial equipment can be made of metal, wood, fiberglass-reinforced  plastic, or  other  materials.    They  can  be  powered  or  manually  operated.    The  device  is considered to be an aerial lift whether or not it is capable of rotating about a substantially vertical  axis.    Aerial lifts must not be “field modified” unless such modification is certified acceptable by  the manufacturer.  5.5.9.10.  OSHA Aerial Lift Rules.  OSHA mandates the following rules:  5.5.9.10.1.  Secure aerial ladders in the lower traveling positions by the locking device on top  of the truck cab and the manually operated device at  the base of the ladder, before the truck is  moved for highway travel.  5.5.9.10.2.  Lift controls must be tested each day prior to use if the lift is to be used that day,  to determine if the controls are in safe working condition.    Lift controls must be tested on a  monthly basis when not in use.  5.5.9.10.3.  Only trained/authorized persons may operate an aerial lift.        5.5.9.10.4.  Wire  rope  should  not  be  used  on  the  boom  sections  of  line  trucks  or  on bucket  trucks  because  it  can  conduct  electricity.    Wire  rope  may  be  used  on  side winches that do not come in  contact with live lines. 5.5.9.10.5.  Do not belt off to an adjacent pole, structure, or equipment while working from an aerial lift. 5.5.9.10.6.  Stand firmly on the floor of the bucket and do not sit or climb on the edge of the bucket or use planks, ladders, or other devices for a work position. 5.5.9.10.7.  Wear a body harness and a lanyard attached to the boom or bucket while working from an aerial lift. 5.5.9.10.8.  Do not exceed the manufacturer’s boom and bucket load limits. 5.5.9.10.9.  Set the brakes and position outriggers on pads or a solid surface.  Install wheel chocks before using an aerial lift on an incline. 5.5.9.10.10. Do not move an aerial lift truck when the boom is elevated in a working position  with workers in the bucket.         5.5.9.10.11. Articulating boom and extensible boom platforms, primarily designed as personnel  carriers,  usually  have  both  platform  (upper)  and  lower  controls.    Upper controls must be in or beside the platform within easy reach of the operator.  Lower controls  must  provide  for  overriding  the  upper  controls.    Controls  must  be  plainly marked  as  to  their  function.    Lower  level  controls  must  not  be  operated  unless permission has been obtained from the worker in the lift, except in case of emergency. 5.5.9.10.12. The insulated portion of an aerial lift must not be altered in any manner that might  reduce its insulating value. 5.5.9.10.13. Inspect  the  boom  before  moving  an  aerial  lift  for  travel.    See  that equipment is properly cradled and outriggers are in the stowed position. 5.5.9.10.14. Insulated Buckets.  An insulated bucket of an aerial lift is provided with an insulated bucket liner. 5.5.9.10.14.1.  Tools  and  other  equipment  carried  in  the  bucket  must  be  stowed carefully to avoid  damaging the insulated bucket liner. 5.5.9.10.14.2.  Insulated  buckets  must  be  subjected  to  an  arm  current  (dielectric) test.  This test consists of placing the insulated bucket in contact with an energized source equal to the voltage to be worked upon for a minimum 3-minute period. 5.5.9.10.14.2.1.   The  leakage  current  must  not  exceed  one  microampere  per kilovolt of nominal line-to-line voltage.  Arm current (dielectric) tests must be accomplished every six months or when changed conditions indicate a need for additional  tests,  such  as  mechanical  alteration  of  the  vehicle  through maintenance procedures.  5.5.9.10.14.2.2.   Keep a record of all tests.  Work operations must be suspended immediately upon any indication of a malfunction in the equipment. 5.5.10.  Pintle Hook Operations.  See the Pintle Hook Lesson Plan for additional information.  5.5.10.1.   After inserting the towing eye into the pintle hook, ensure the upper jaw is closed and  the latch manual unlock device it properly aligned.  5.5.10.2.   Once connection is made, do not step over the tow bar.  5.5.10.3.   Cotter/safety pin usage:    Before inserting the safety pin, pry the end of the pin open  by hand to  the necessary extent, so  that when compressed for installation into the locking device there is enough tension to keep the safety pin from vibrating free.  5.5.10.4.   MS type quick release pin:    Before inserting the safety pin, ensure ball locks are present and not excessively worn, and that the push button is secure in the pin body  and the button moves freely.  5.5.10.5.   After the safety pin is installed, pull up on the latch (manual unlock device) to ensure  the upper jaw will not open and the pintle assembly is locked (beware of equipment with spring  loaded tow bars).   If the manual locking device is not properly secured, spring loaded tow bars or  tow bars under pressure can  come out  of the pintle hook and  cause injury and/ or damage.  5.5.10.6.   When  towing  a  trailer,  federal  safety  regulations  require  one  or  more  safety devices to  prevent the towed equipment from breaking loose of the tow vehicle.    The use of  safety chains is mandatory.  5.5.10.7.   Attach safety chains to  vehicle towing eyes.    If  towing eyes  are not  available, secure  chains around the towing vehicle’s frame.  If the frame is inaccessible, wrapping the  chains around the bumper is acceptable, but only as a last resort.  5.5.10.8.   If electrical hook-ups are available, make appropriate connections and check for proper operation of electrical devices on trailer.  5.5.10.9.   If  trailer  brake  airlines  are  available,  make  appropriate  connections  and  test system  before moving the vehicle.  5.5.10.10.  With spotter, clear a line of travel.  Pull the vehicle forward while spotter ensures equipment is properly attached.  5.5.10.11.  Additional checks should be made at each work or rest location.  5.5.10.12.  After towing  a  short  distance  (one  half  mile), stop  and  check the  pintle hook locking  device and safety chains.  5.5.10.13.  Ensure  towing  vehicle  is  properly  stopped  and  in  PARK  or  NEUTRAL  with parking  brake set.  5.5.10.14.  Ensure the towed equipment’s integral brake system, if equipped, is set.  5.5.10.15.  Remove safety pin and unlock pintle latch (manual unlock device).  5.5.10.16.  Open pintle and remove towing eye, properly stowing the towing eye.    Section 6—EXPLANATION AND DEMONSTRATION  6.1.
