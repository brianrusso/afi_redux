SUMMARY OF CHANGES This document has been substantially revised and must be completely reviewed.  2 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 Chapter  1  changes,  clarifies  and  provides  more  detailed  guidance  on  settlement  authority responsibilities  and  outlines  geographic  claims  jurisdiction  for  tort  claims.    Chapter  2  provides more  detailed  direction  on  tort  claim  investigative  steps.    Chapter  3  adds  a  requirement  to forward legal memoranda to the Department of Justice for certain cases.  Chapter 4 requires that overseas Military Claims Act (MCA) claims are evaluated for liability by applying the currently adopted  Restatement  of  the  Law.    Chapter  5  formalizes  the  important  role  for  Staff  Judge Advocates  (SJA)  of  the  Air  Force  component  commands  of  the  U.S.  geographic  combatant commands  in  establishing  claims  jurisdiction  for  Air  Force  tort  claims  arising  within  their respective  areas  of  responsibility  (AOR),  vests  the  SJAs  with  substantial  flexibility  in establishing appropriate settlement authority levels for subordinate Air Force legal offices falling under them, and clarifies when the Foreign Claims Act applies.  Chapter 6 clarifies that National Guard  Claims  Act  claims  apply  only  to  claims  arising  from  noncombat  activities  and  do  not require a showing of fault or negligence; and clarifies when torts arising from volunteer activities are paid with appropriated funds.  Chapters 7 through 9 are new to this instruction but have been adopted from Air Force Instruction (AFI) 51-502, Personnel and Government Recovery Claims, 1 Mar 97, to reflect the organizational responsible has changed to AFLOA/JACC.  Chapter 7 is substantially  changed  to  reflect  the  transition  from  the  installation-based  Hospital  Recovery Program  to  the  regional-based  Medical  Cost  Reimbursement  Program  (MCRP).      Chapter  8 includes  more  detailed  guidance  on  processing  Article  139,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice (UCMJ)  claims.    Chapter  9  clarifies  the  relationship  between  AFLOA/JACC  and  installation legal offices as it relates to property damage claims in favor of the United States.

For tort claims arising in the United States and any United States territory where the Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  (FTCA)  (28  USC  1346(b),  2671-2680)  is  applicable,  Air  Force Legal Operations Agency, Claims and Tort  Litigation Division (AFLOA/JACC) determines geographic  areas  of  claims  responsibility.    (T-1)  It  approves  changes  to  claims  jurisdiction maps and decides which installation SJA takes responsibility for a claim if a question arises. (T-1) 1.2.2.  For tort claims arising outside the United States or in any territory where the FTCA is inapplicable,  the  SJA  of  the  Air  Force  geographic  component  command  of  the  appropriate United States combatant command determines geographic areas of claims responsibility for its own office and all subordinate offices.  In relation to Air Force claims: 1.2.2.1.  United States Air Forces in Europe Judge Advocate (USAFE/JA) is responsible for United States European Command’s (USEUCOM) AOR. (T-1) 1.2.2.2.

(T-1) 1.2.3.  Single  Service  Claims  Responsibility.  The  Department  of  Defense  has  assigned responsibility  for  the  settlement  of  certain  claims  in  certain  countries  to  a  single  branch  of service,  regardless  of  which  branch  the  tortfeasor  belongs  to,  pursuant  to  DoDI  5515.08, Assignment of Claims Responsibility, under the following statutes and agreements: 1.2.3.1.  Foreign Claims Act (FCA) (10 USC 2734). 1.2.3.2.  MCA (10 USC 2733). 1.2.3.3.  International Agreement Claims Act (IACA) (10 USC 2734a and 2734b). 1.2.3.4.

In  addition  to  assigning  specific  countries  to  the  Military  Departments  of  the  Army, Navy,  and  Air  Force,  DoDI  5515.08  authorizes  DoD/GC  to  change  existing  country assignments  as  well  as  issue  new  assignments  for  countries  not  yet  assigned.    Changes  in assignments  or  new  assignments  brought  to  AFLOA/JACC  attention  are  posted  on AFLOA/JACC’s homepage under “Foreign/International Tort Claims.” (T-3) 1.2.5.  Although  Air  Force  legal  offices  lack  authority  to  settle  claims  arising  in  countries assigned to the Departments of the Army and the Navy, the Air Force assists Army and Navy legal offices in investigating such claims when they involve Air Force property or personnel, or other property or personnel under Air Force control.

Scope  of  this  Chapter.  This  chapter  identifies  standard  procedures  for  processing  tort claims  under  the  FTCA,  28  USC  1346(b),  2671-2680,  the  MCA,  10  USC  2733,  the  FCA,  10 USC 2734, the National Guard Claims Act, 32 USC 715, the Air Force Admiralty Claims Act, 10 USC 9801-9804, 9806, the Admiralty Extension Act, 46 USC 30101, the Use of Government Property  Claims  Act,  10  USC  2737,  as  well  as  Nonappropriated  Fund  Tort  Claims.    Refer  to individual chapters discussing these types of tort claims for statute-specific instructions. 2.2.  Avoiding  Conflicting  Interests.  Air  Force  personnel  do  not  represent  any  claimant  or potential  claimant  in  a  claim  against  the  United  States.  (T-0)    Responding  to  a  claimant’s inquiries  on  the  policies  and  procedures  for  filing  a  claim  is  not  considered  representing  a claimant.  At  the  same  time,  claims  personnel  are  mindful  that  their  client  is  the  Air  Force  and avoid actions which are adverse to those of their client. (T-0). 2.3.  Prohibited Actions.  Claims personnel do not: 2.3.1.  Suggest to or advise claimants how much to claim.  (T-1) 2.3.2.  Give  an  opinion  to  the  claimant  or  claimant’s  representative  about  an  anticipated approval or disapproval of the claim.  (T-1) 2.3.3.  Reveal the recommendations of a settlement authority outside claims channels.  (T-1) 2.4.  Presenting Tort Claims: 2.4.1.  Filing  a  claim.  A  claimant  or  authorized  agent  presents  to  the  Air  Force  a  properly signed Standard Form 95, Claim for Damage, Injury, or Death, or other signed writing for money damages in a sum certain for damage to or loss of property, personal injury, or death.  See  Chapter  5,  paragraph  5.15  for  additional  discussion  of  filing  requirements  under  the FCA. 2.4.2.  Taking  Immediate  Action  on  a  New  Claim.  Upon  receipt  of  a  new  tort  claim,  base legal personnel who receipt for the claim mark the date received, their initials, and the office symbol of the receiving office on the tort claim. (T-1) Legal personnel who first receive the claim  enter  the  claim  information  into  the  Air  Force  claims  database  and,  if  appropriate, transfer it to the proper settlement authority. (T-0) If the Air Force is the appropriate agency to adjudicate the claim, base legal personnel send a written acknowledgment of receipt of the claim to the claimant or the claimant’s authorized agent.  (T-1) 2.4.3.  Deficient Claims.  For claims that do not meet the basic requirements of a valid claim (no signature or lacking a sum certain), mark the date received, initials, and the office symbol of the receiving office on the document. (T-1) Notify the sender of the deficiency and of the requirement to present a proper claim within two years of the date of accrual. (T-1) A claim normally accrues at the time of injury or when essential operative facts of both the existence and cause of injury are apparent. Apply rules governing accrual found in federal court cases decided under the FTCA.  (T-0)  Return the original submissions to the sender and retain a copy  of  the  document(s)  and  correspondence  in  a  potential  claims  file  in  accordance  with established disposition guidelines. (T-1) 18 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 2.4.4.  Transferring a Claim.  Base legal personnel receiving a claim from an incident that did not  occur  within  their  assigned  geographic  area  or  a  claim  they  are  unable  to  settle  within their settlement authority transfer it to the appropriate legal office or government agency.  (T-0) Air Force offices contact AFLOA/JACC or the appropriate Army or Navy legal office for guidance  on  where  to  transfer  a  claim  for  which  the  Army  or  Navy  has  been  assigned responsibility.  (T-1) Base legal personnel investigate and provide a legal analysis regarding all  tort  claims  arising  out  of  environmental  damage  in  accordance  with  published  guidance from AFLOA/JACE prior to transferring an environmental tort claim to AFLOA/JACE.  (T-1) 2.4.5.  Amending  a  Claim.  A  claimant  may  amend  the  amount  of  a  claim  in  writing  at  any time before final action is taken on the claim. 2.5.  Who are Proper Tort Claimants: 2.5.1.  Owners  of  property  for  property  damage,  their  duly  authorized  agents  or  legal representatives. 2.5.2.  Injured persons for personal injury. 2.5.3.  Executors  or  administrators  of  estates  or  personal  representatives  of  deceased personnel based on the applicable state wrongful death statute or by any other person legally entitled to assert such a claim in accordance with applicable law. 2.5.4.  The subrogor (insured) and the subrogee (insurer), jointly or individually. 2.6.  Signatures on Tort Claims: 2.6.1.  Claimant  or  Agent.  The  claimant  or  an  authorized  agent  signs  the  claim.  If  an authorized  agent  signs  the  claim  on  behalf  of  a  claimant,  the  authorized  agent  attaches  a power of attorney, retainer agreement, or other evidence of authority to act on behalf of the claimant. 2.6.2.  Owners  of  Property.  All  owners  or  their  authorized  agents  having  an  interest  in property  that  is  the  subject  of  a  claim  sign  the  claim.  Lien  holders  (such  as  mortgage companies or banks who provide loans on real or personal property) are not required to sign the claim. 2.6.3.  Corporations or subrogees. An authorized representative, showing the capacity to file claims on behalf of the corporation or insurance company, sign the claim. 2.7.  Substantiating Tort Claims.  For all torts claims filed against the United States Air Force, claimants substantiate their claims by submitting documentation in accordance with 28 Code of Federal  Regulations  (CFR),  Part  14.4,  Administrative  Claims,  Evidence  and  Information  to  be Submitted.  NOTE:  Claims  filed  without  proper  substantiation  are  still  valid  claims  for tolling the statute of limitations. 2.7.1.  Costs  of  preparing  and  presenting  a  claim,  such  as  copying  charges,  appraisals,  and attorneys’ fees are not payable. 2.7.1.1.  Private  health  care  professionals  typically  charge  a  fee  to  provide  copies  of medical records. Claimants provide copies of their own private medical records, and pay all associated fees, instead of providing a release authorizing the Air Force to obtain their records. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 19 2.7.1.2.  Nevertheless,  to  further  substantiate  or  test  the  validity  of  a  claim,  claims investigators  may  request  that  claimants  provide  a  release  authorizing  the  Air  Force  to obtain records and information directly from any medical provider.  Any fees associated with records produced by any medical provider under such release are the responsibility of the claimant. 2.7.2.  When  a  claimant  fails  to  provide  substantiation  necessary  to  adjudicate  the  claim, including  a  requested  medical  release  and  payment  of  associated  fees,  base  legal  personnel immediately notify the claimant (or attorney) in writing. (T-1) This may be done in the same correspondence  that  acknowledges  receipt  of  the  claim.  If  the  claimant  fails  to  provide  the requested documentation after a reasonable amount of time and after legal personnel send a follow-up  letter,  continue  investigating  and  processing  the  claim  in  accordance  with paragraph 2.8. (T-1) 2.8.  Investigating  and  Processing  Tort  Claims.  When  charged  with  all  or  part  of  the responsibility to investigate tort claims, such as where the tort claim arises out of environmental damage,  base  legal  personnel  investigate  and  process  tort  claims  as  follows  and  in  accordance with published guidance from AFLOA/JACC (or AFLOA/JACE for environmental tort claims):  (T-1) 2.8.1.  Witness  Interviews.  Interview  principal  witnesses  promptly  (to  include  claimants  if they have or know information material to their tort claim). (T-1) 2.8.1.1.  Do  not  make  a  recording  of  your  conversations  with  witnesses  or  correspond with witnesses in writing, including email, except for purely administrative matters such as  scheduling  meeting  times  and  locations.  Exceptions  to  this  policy  may  only  be approved  by  AFLOA/JACC  (or  AFLOA/JACE  for  environmental  torts).  Summarize witness  interviews  in  a  memorandum  for  record,  including  frank  impressions  of  the credibility  of  the  witness.  (T-1)  Never  permit  witnesses  to  review  or  sign  your memorandum or interview notes. 2.8.1.2.  The  information  included  in  the  memorandum  may  be  communicated  between legal  personnel  and  a  client  for  the  purposes  of  providing  legal  advice  or  guidance.    It may also be communicated to a decision maker in the deliberative process.  Additionally, the  memorandum  may  contain  the  mental  impressions,  observations,  or  conclusions  of legal  personnel  created  with  an  eye  toward  future  litigation,  even  if  the  litigation  is  not presently reasonably anticipated. 2.8.1.3.  Accordingly,  include  the  following  language  in  your  memorandum:  “Caution:  This document may contain information protected from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege, the deliberative process privilege, the attorney work-product doctrine, or other applicable laws, rules, regulations, or orders." (T-1) 2.8.2.  Witness  Locator  Information.  On  the  interview  memorandum  or  on  a  separate  chart, record the following information for each witness:  (T-1) 2.8.2.1.  Full name. 2.8.2.2.  Current work and home address. 2.8.2.3.  Duty/work and home phone (commercial and DSN). 2.8.2.4.  Expected PCS transfer or completion of service date. 20 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 2.8.2.5.  Address for future contact. 2.8.2.6.  For medical providers, state of licensure. 2.8.2.7.  Short description of witness’ involvement. 2.8.2.8.  Projected deployment data. 2.8.3.  Documents.  Obtain  copies  of  all  relevant  documents.    (T-1)  For  each  document, identify  the  name,  duty  address,  and  telephone  number  of  the  custodian  of  the  original document. (T-1) 2.8.4.  Photographs.  Take  photographs  as  soon  as  possible.  (T-1)      For  digital  photographs, immediately download the photographs from the camera to a non-rewritable medium. (T-1)  Mark  the  medium  with  the  date  the  photographs  were  taken  and  the  name  of  the  person(s) who took them. (T-1) Print paper copies of the photographs and annotate the back of them as set forth above. (T-1) Secure the medium in a similar manner as negatives. (T-1) 2.8.5.  Legal Memorandum. Prepare a Legal Memorandum for all tort claims. (T-1)  In each memorandum, include: (T-1) 2.8.5.1.  The  claimant’s  name,  the  claim  number,  the  amount  of  the  claim,  the  date  and place it was presented, and the amount and date of any amendments. 2.8.5.2.  The type of claim. 2.8.5.3.  The date and place of the incident. 2.8.5.4.  Address  of  claimant  (if  represented  by  an  attorney,  also  include  the  name, address and telephone number of the attorney). 2.8.5.5.  Facts of the incident. 2.8.5.6.  Brief of the applicable law (federal and state and/or local law). 2.8.5.7.  Liability  and  damage  analysis  and  a  recommendation  as  to  disposition  of  the claim. 2.8.6.  Assembling Tort Claim Files.  Assemble and tab all tort claim files in accordance with Attachment 2.  (T-1) 2.8.6.1.  Summary  Adjudication  Memo.    Claims  adjudicators  may  use  a  summary adjudication memorandum (see Attachment 3) if the facts and law are simple enough to permit  full  treatment  of  the  relevant  issues  to  expedite  handling  of  non-meritorious claims.    This  includes  claims  obviously  subject  to  denial  or  summary  judgment  at  trial (e.g., Feres barred or beyond the statute of limitations). 2.9.  Action  by  Settlement  Authorities.  A settlement authority takes final action on all claims where the amount claimed or the negotiated settlement is within his or her delegated settlement authority.  (T-1) (See Table A1.2) 2.9.1.  Forwarding  Claims.    SJAs  forward  claims  outside  their  settlement  authority  to  the appropriate settlement authority immediately upon receipt unless he or she has investigative responsibility.    (T-1)  If  the  SJA  with  settlement  authority  is  unable  to  settle  a  claim,  but denial  is  inappropriate,  he  or  she  forwards  the  claim  to  AFLOA/JACC.    (T-1)  Where possible, forward tort claims electronically according to the current AFLOA/JACC policy. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 21 2.9.2.  Paying Claims. The settlement authority informs the claimant of the amount and basis of the offer. (T-1) Any offer letter contains the citation to the statute under which the claim was adjudicated. (T-1) 2.9.2.1.  Before  the  settlement  authority  pays  the  claimant,  the  claimant  accepts  the amount  offered  in  full  satisfaction  of  the  claim  and  sign  the  DoJ-approved  settlement agreement.  (T-1)  Settlement  authorities  do  not  sign  the  settlement  agreement  until  after the claimant does so. (T-1) Modifications to that agreement, other than those specifically authorized and contemplated in the template found on the AFLOA/JACC website, are not permitted. Contact AFLOA/JACC if a claimant refuses to sign the settlement agreement without modification. (T-1) 2.9.2.2.  If the claimant  rejects  the offer,  further  negotiations may  be conducted.  When the claims office makes an offer on the claim and the claimant is given a specific date by which to accept the offer and it is not accepted, the claims office sends a separate denial letter.  (T-1)  Do not  send offer letters containing self-executing denials at  some time in the future. Do not put a contingent denial in the settlement offer, e.g., “If this offer is not acceptable, your claim is denied.” 2.9.2.3.  Attorney  fees  are  statutorily  capped  at  20  percent  of  the  total  of  any administrative  settlement  amount  for  claims  under  28  USC  2672.    Attorney  fees  are statutorily capped at 25 percent of the total of any administrative settlement amount for claims under 28 USC 1346(b).  Attorney fees are calculated based on and deducted from the  amount  tendered  in  settlement  and  not  in  addition  thereto.    For  example,  if  a  claim settles for $5,000, the attorney shall not charge the claimant more than $1,000 in attorney fees, which is payable from the $5,000 settlement. 2.9.2.3.1.  In a structured settlement,  the Air  Force calculates attorney  fees from  the total  cost  of  the  settlement  to  the  U.S.,  and  not  on  the  payout  value  of  the  benefits under the settlement. 2.9.2.4.  Punitive or exemplary damages  are not payable under any claims statute in this instruction. 2.9.3.  Denying Claims. The settlement authority sends a final denial letter to the claimant or authorized  agent  by  certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested.  (T-0)  The  letter  is  mailed  the same day as the date that appears on the letter. (T-1) The letter states: (T-1) 2.9.3.1.  The full title and legal citation of the statute under which the settlement authority considered the claim. 2.9.3.2.  The reasons for denial. 2.9.3.3.  A letter denying an FTCA claim includes the following language: “If [you/your client/John  Doe]  are/is  dissatisfied  with  this  decision,  [you/he/she/they/John  Doe]  may file suit in  an appropriate U.S.  District  Court not  later than six months after the date of mailing of this letter.” 2.9.3.4.  A  letter  denying  an  MCA  claim  includes  the  following  language:  “This  is  the final  denial  of  [your/your  client’s/John  Doe’s]  claim  under  the  Military  Claims  Act. However, if [you/your client/John Doe] so desire[s], [you/he/she/John Doe] may appeal this  decision.  No  particular  form  is  necessary,  but  the  appeal  should  be  in  writing, 22 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 describe  the  reasons  for  the  appeal,  provide  any  additional  evidence  to  substantiate  the claim, and arrive at this office within 60 days of the date of this letter.” 2.9.3.4.1.  A letter denying an MCA claim arising from a noncombat activity arising in the 50 states or U.S. territories where the FTCA is applicable, or an NGCA claim,  includes the following language:  “This is the final denial of [your/your client’s/John Doe’s] claim under the [Military Claims Act/National Guard Claims Act]. However, if  [you/your  client/John  Doe]  so  desire[s],  [you/he/she/John  Doe]  may  appeal  this decision.  No  particular  form  is  necessary,  but  the  appeal  should  be  in  writing, describe  the  reasons  for  the  appeal,  provide  any  additional  evidence  to  substantiate the claim, and arrive at this office within 60 days of the date of this letter.  This also serves as the final denial of [your/your client’s/John Doe’s] claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act.  If [you/your client/John Doe] are/is dissatisfied with this decision, [you/he/she/they/John  Doe]  may  file  suit  in  an  appropriate  U.S.  District  Court  not later than six months after the date of mailing of this letter.” (T-1) 2.9.3.5.  Upon receipt of the executed return receipt postcard, attach it to the copy of the denial letter maintained in the claim file. (T-1) 2.10.  Making Advance Payments: 2.10.1.  If  all  of  the  following  are  present,  settlement  authorities  may  make  an  advance payment: 2.10.1.1.  The claimant requests it. 2.10.1.2.  The claimant appears to have a valid MCA, FCA, or NGCA claim that exceeds the  amount  of  the  advance  payment.    Settlement  authorities  may  not  make  advance payments for FTCA claims. 2.10.1.3.  The circumstances demonstrate an immediate need for food, shelter, medical or burial  expenses,  or  other  necessities.  The  Air  Force  may  make  an  advance  payment  for the benefit of commercial enterprise only if necessary to prevent severe financial loss or bankruptcy. 2.10.2.  TJAG may make an advance payment of $100,000 or less. 2.10.3.  The  following  settlement  authorities  may  make  an  advance  payment  of  $25,000  or less: 2.10.3.1.  Director, AFLOA/JAC 2.10.3.2.  Chief and Branch Chiefs, AFLOA/JACC. 2.10.3.3.  Chief, AFLOA/JACE (for environmental torts). 2.10.3.4.  The  SJAs  of  the  Air  Force  component  commands  of  the  U.S.  geographic combatant  commands  for  claims  arising  within  their  respective  combatant  command AORs. 2.10.4.  Settlement authorities may delegate their authority to make advance payments orally. The delegation is confirmed in writing within 30 days. 2.10.5.  Before  making  advance  payments,  settlement  authorities  first  obtain  from  the aggrieved person a signed advance payment agreement which includes the requirements to: AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 23 2.10.5.1.  Refund  the  money  if  the  claimant  does  not  file  a  claim  within  the  statutory period. 2.10.5.2.  Refund any portion of the advance payment that exceeds the final settlement. 2.11.  Splitting  a  Claim.  Even  if  claimant  files  separate  claims  for  property  damage  and personal injury arising out of the same incident, do not settle or pay a separate or split claim. 2.11.1.  Making an advance payment does not constitute splitting a claim. 2.11.2.  Do not  settle a claim  filed by a subrogee (insurer) prior to  settling the claim  of the subrogor (insured) without prior approval of AFLOA/JACC or AFLOA/JACE. 2.12.  Acting  on  Reconsiderations.  A  settlement  authority  has  the  inherent  authority  to reconsider a final decision. The mere fact that a request for reconsideration is received does not obligate the settlement authority to reopen the claim. 2.12.1.  For  claims  denied  under  the  FCA  and  FTCA,  there  is  no  statutory  right  to  request reconsideration.    Do  not  mention  a  reconsideration  right  in  the  original  letter  of  denial.  However,  if  a  request  for  reconsideration  is  received  under  the  FTCA,  the  settlement authority reopens the claim.  (T-1) See Chapter 3, paragraph 3.5. 2.12.2.  For  claims  denied  under  the  MCA,  NGCA,  and  10  USC  2738  (Property  Loss: Reimbursement  for  certain  losses  of  household  effects  caused  by  hostile  action),  there  is  a statutory  right  to  appeal  the  final  decision  and  the  claimant  is  so  advised.    (T-1)  See paragraphs 4.11 (MCA); paragraph 6.20 (NGCA); and paragraph 6.45 (10 USC 2738). 2.12.3.  A settlement authority reconsiders the final action when there is: 2.12.3.1.  New and material evidence concerning the claim (T-1)  or, 2.12.3.2.  Obvious errors in the original decision. (T-1) 2.12.4.  A  settlement  authority  documents  in  the  claim  file  his  or  her  reason  for reconsideration. (T-1) 2.12.5.  A settlement authority above the original settlement authority may direct a claim be forwarded to a higher settlement authority for reconsideration. 2.13.  Handling  Requests  for  Tort  Claim  Files.  Tort  claim  files  are  the  property  of  the  Air Force and are protected from disclosure under the attorney work-product privilege. 2.13.1.  Do not give claim files to claimants or their agents for review or reproduction. 2.13.2.  Process Freedom of Information Act or Privacy Act requests for files in accordance with  DoD  Regulation  5400.7-R_AFMAN  33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA) Program and AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy and Civil Liberties Program respectively. (T-0) 2.13.3.  Never release outside JA or DoJ, these documents from the claim file: 2.13.3.1.  Legal memoranda containing opinions, conclusions, and recommendations. 2.13.3.2.  Attorneys’ and paralegals’ written summaries of witness interviews. 2.13.3.3.  Experts’ written reports and evaluations (including engineering reports on sonic boom complaints), without approval of AFLOA/JACC or AFLOA/JACE. 2.13.3.4.  Medical Quality Assurance documents (10 USC 1102). 24 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 2.13.3.5.  Other  material  acquired  as  part  of  the  deliberative  process,  including  legal research. 2.14.  Claim Withdrawal.  Contact AFLOA/JACC when a claimant withdraws a claim prior to final adjudication. (T-1) 2.15.  Claim  File  Disposition.  Maintain  claim  files  in  accordance  with  record  retention regulations. (T-1) AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 25 Chapter 3 FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT CLAIMS 3.1.  Scope of this Chapter.  This chapter implements the FTCA, 28 USC 1346(b), 2671-2680, and 28 CFR, Part 14, Administrative Claims Under Federal Tort Claims Act. 3.1.1.  The  federal  government  may  be  held  liable  for  the  negligent  or  wrongful  acts  or omissions  of  its  employees  while  acting  within  the  scope  of  their  office  or  employment,  to the extent the U.S. has waived its sovereign immunity. 3.1.2.  Government liability is similar to that of a private person and is determined by the law of the place where the act or omission occurred. 3.2.  FTCA Settlement Authority:  (See Table A1.2) 3.2.1.  SECAF,  TJAG,  Deputy  Judge  Advocate  General  (DJAG),  AFLOA/JAC,  and AFLOA/JACC may: 3.2.1.1.  Deny claims in any amount, as appropriate. 3.2.1.2.  Pay claims, notwithstanding the amount claimed, when payment is for $300,000 or less, inclusive of subrogation claims. 3.2.1.3.  Negotiate  settlements  exceeding  $300,000,  inclusive  of  subrogation  claims, subject to approval of the U.S. Attorney General or designee. NOTE: AFLOA/JACC does not have settlement authority over environmental tort claims. 3.2.2.  TJAG, DJAG, AFLOA/JAC, and AFLOA/JACE may: 3.2.2.1.  Deny environmental tort claims in any amount, as appropriate. 3.2.2.2.  Pay  environmental  tort  claims,  notwithstanding  the  amount  claimed,  when payment is for $300,000 or less, inclusive of subrogation claims. 3.2.2.3.  Negotiate  environmental  tort  claims  settlements  exceeding  $300,000,  inclusive of subrogation claims, subject to approval of the U.S. Attorney General or designee. NOTE: Use Chapter 1 for information regarding tort claim authority responsibilities and restrictions. 3.3.  Redelegating Authority.  Settlement authorities may redelegate a portion or all of their full authority,  in  writing,  to  a  subordinate  judge  advocate,  or  civilian  attorney.  The  Chief, AFLOA/JACC may redelegate up to $25,000, in writing, to AFLOA/JACC paralegals.  Upon a written  request  by  an  installation  SJA,  AFLOA/JACC  may  authorize  installation  SJAs  to redelegate their settlement authority to base level paralegals. 3.4.  Statute  of  Limitations.  A  claim  must  be  presented  in  writing  to  the  appropriate  federal agency  within  2  years  of  accrual.  A  claim  normally  accrues  at  the  time  of  injury  or  when essential  operative  facts  of  both  the  existence  and  cause  of  injury  are  apparent.  Apply  rules governing accrual found in federal court cases decided under the FTCA. 3.5.  Acting on Reconsiderations.  In its regulations (28 CFR, Part 14), DoJ provides a claimant the  opportunity  to  request  reconsideration  of  the  denial  of  a  claim  under  the  FTCA.  Those 26 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 regulations are controlling. The request for reconsideration must be received by the Air Force not later than 6 months after the date of the mailing of the denial letter. Upon receipt of a request for reconsideration: 3.5.1.  The  settlement  authority  reviews  the  claim  and  any  new  evidence  submitted  to determine if an offer is appropriate. (T-1) If so, and if the offer is within its settlement limits, the settlement authority makes an offer. (T-1) 3.5.2.  If the claim is not settled, or the settlement authority recommends denial of the claim, the  settlement  authority  forwards  the  claim,  as  soon  as  possible  after  receipt,  to AFLOA/JACC  or  AFLOA/JACE  (for  environmental  tort  claims).  (T-1)  No  settlement authority  below  AFLOA/JACC  or  JACE  may  deny  a  claim  on  reconsideration  under  the FTCA. 3.5.2.1.  Settlement  authorities  do  not  mention  reconsideration  in  the  original  denial letter. 3.5.2.2.  An FTCA claim may only be reconsidered once. (T-1) 3.6.  Making Payments.  Settlement authorities pay claims as follows: 3.6.1.  To  receive  payment,  claimants  sign  a  settlement  agreement  in  the  format  designated by DoJ. Modifications to the settlement agreement, other than to insert the particulars of the claim  in  the  appropriate  locations,  are  not  authorized.  The  Air  Force  attorney  signs  the settlement  agreement  after  receiving  a  fully  executed  agreement  from  the  claimant  and  the Air  Force  settlement  authority  approves  the  agreement.  (T-1)  In  settlements  exceeding $300,000  the  Air  Force  attorney  signs  the  settlement  agreement  after  DoJ  approves  the settlement. (T-1) 3.6.1.1.  With  any  settlement  in  an  amount  in  excess  of  $100,000  and  within  the delegated settlement amount ($300,000), a copy of the legal memorandum explaining the basis for the settlement is sent to the Director, FTCA Staff, Torts Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice. (T-1) 3.6.2.  Payments for $2,500 or Less. Use Air Force claims funds (SF 1034) for settlements of $2,500 or less. (T-1) 3.6.3.  Payments  Exceeding  $2,500.  For  payments  in  excess  of  $2,500,  the  settlement authority  sends  payment  documents  directly  to:  Judgment  Fund  Group,  Department  of  the Treasury, Financial Management Service, Prince George’s Metro Center 2, 3700 East-West Highway,  Rm  6F03,  Hyattsville,  MD  20782,  for  payment  under  31  USC  1304.  (T-1)  The payment documents include: 3.6.3.1.  A signed payment voucher (FMS Form 197A).  (T-1) The voucher contains the payee’s taxpayer identification number (social security number for individuals). (T-1) If an  attorney  represents  the  claimant,  the  voucher  contains  the  taxpayer  identification numbers of both the claimant and the attorney. (T-1) Do not provide a fund cite. 3.6.3.2.  A completed FMS Form 194 (Judgment Fund Transmittal). (T-1) 3.6.3.3.  A completed FMS Form 196, front and back. (T-1) 3.6.3.4.  A signed settlement agreement.

(T-0) 28 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 CHAPTER 4 MILITARY CLAIMS ACT CLAIMS 4.1.  Scope  of  this  Chapter.  This  chapter  implements  the  MCA,  10  USC  2733,  and  DoD Directive 5515.3, Settlement of Claims Under Sections 2733, 2734, 2734a, and 2734b of Title 10, US Code; and DoD Instruction 5515.08. 4.1.1.  Payment under the Act is made “[u]nder such regulations as the Secretary concerned may prescribe…” This  instruction prescribes how the Air Force implements  the MCA. The Act  allows  only  an  administrative  determination  of  claims.  The  MCA  does  not  provide  a judicial remedy. 4.1.2.  The  MCA  allows  the  military  services  to  settle  claims  for  death,  personal  injury,  or property damage arising from the negligent or wrongful acts by members or employees of the armed forces acting within the scope of employment, and for losses sustained as a result of the noncombat activities of the military services. The MCA applies worldwide. However, for claims arising in the U.S., the MCA only applies to noncombat activity claims and incident to service property damage claims of military members. 4.2.  MCA Settlement Authority:  (See Table A1.2) 4.2.1.  SECAF  may  deny  or  approve  claims  for  any  amount.  For  claims  approved  for  more than $100,000, SECAF or his or her designee reports the amount in excess of $100,000 to the Department of the Treasury for payment. (T-0) 4.2.2.  TJAG may deny claims filed in any amount and approve claims in an amount not to exceed $100,000, notwithstanding the amount claimed. 4.2.3.  DJAG;  Director,  AFLOA/JAC;  Chief  and  Branch  Chiefs,  AFLOA/JACC;  Chief  and Environmental  Litigation  Center  Chief,  AFLOA/JACE  (for  environmental  torts)  may  deny claims  filed  in  any  amount  and  approve  claims  in  an  amount  not  to  exceed  $25,000, notwithstanding the amount claimed. 4.2.4.  Installation SJAs in the 48 contiguous states for tort claims in their geographic claims jurisdiction investigate and take final action on tort claims involving solely property damage where the amount claimed is  $5,000 or less. (T-1)   NOTE:  If a claim  for property damage exceeds $5,000, an installation SJA may request authority from AFLOA/JACC to take final action  on  the  claim.    For  example,  a  base  may  request  authority  to  settle  or  deny  a  $6,000 claim because they believe adjudication can be accomplished promptly. 4.2.5.  The SJAs responsible for claims arising in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam, as well as the SJAs  of  the  Air  Force  component  commands  of  the  U.S.  geographic  combatant  commands responsible for claims in their respective combatant command AORs, may deny claims filed in  an  amount  of  $25,000  or  less  and  pay  claims  filed  in  any  amount  when  payment  is  for $25,000 or less. NOTE: Use Chapter 1 for information regarding further tort claim authority responsibilities and restrictions. 4.3.  Redelegating  MCA  Settlement  Authority.  Settlement  authorities  may  redelegate  a portion  or  all  of  their  full  authority,  in  writing,  to  a  subordinate  judge  advocate  or  civilian AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 29 attorney. The Chief, AFLOA/JACC may redelegate up to $25,000, in writing, to AFLOA/JACC paralegals.  Upon  a  written  request  by  an  installation  SJA,  AFLOA/JACC  may  authorize installation SJAs to redelegate their settlement authority to base level paralegals. 4.4.  Who are Proper Claimants: 4.4.1.  Persons  determined  to  be  U.S.  inhabitants.    U.S.  inhabitants  includes  dependents  of U.S.  military  personnel  and  federal  civilian  employees  temporarily  outside  the  U.S.  for purposes of U.S. government service. 4.4.2.  U.S. military personnel and federal civilian employees.   EXCEPTION:  Do not pay claims  under  the  MCA  for  personal  injury  or  death  of  U.S.  military  personnel  or  federal civilian employees that occurred incident to their service. 4.4.3.  Foreign  military  personnel  when  the  damage  or  injury  occurs  in  the  U.S.  EXCEPTION:    Do  not  pay  claims  under  the  MCA  for  personal  injury  or  death  of  foreign military personnel that occurred incident to their service. 4.4.4.  States, state agencies, counties, municipalities, and their political subdivisions. 4.4.5.  Subrogees (insurers) of proper claimants to the extent they have paid the claim. 4.5.  Who are Not Proper Claimants: 4.5.1.  Governments of foreign nations, their agencies, and political subdivisions. 4.5.2.  Agencies and NAFIs of the federal government. 4.5.3.  Inhabitants of foreign countries for damages or injuries incurred in a foreign country. 4.6.  Statute  of  Limitations.  A  claim  must  be  presented  in  writing  to  the  appropriate  federal agency within 2  years of accrual.  Under the MCA, the 2-year limitations period is  tolled if the United States is at war or in an armed conflict when the claim accrues, or the U.S. enters a war or armed  conflict  after  the  claim  accrues.    Good  cause  must  be  shown  for  any  tolling  under  this paragraph.  A claim  normally  accrues at  the time of injury or when essential  operative facts  of both  the  existence  and  cause  of  injury  are  apparent.  Apply  rules  governing  accrual  found  in federal court cases decided under the FTCA.  In computing the statutory time period, exclude the date of the incident and include the date the claim is presented. 4.7.  Payable MCA Claims: 4.7.1.  Negligent or Wrongful Act or Omission Claims.  Settlement authorities pay claims for damages  resulting  from  negligent  or  wrongful  acts  or  omissions  of  military  or  civilian personnel  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  while  acting  within  the  scope  of  their  employment, unless an exclusion listed in paragraph 4.8. applies. 4.7.2.  Noncombat Activity Claims.  Settlement authorities pay claims for damages caused by the  noncombat  activities  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  unless  an  exclusion  listed  in  paragraph 4.8  applies.    Noncombat  activities  are  defined  in  Attachment  1  to  this  Instruction.  It  is  not necessary for a payable claim to arise from a wrongful act or omission or negligence. 4.8.  MCA  Exclusions.  Settlement  authorities  cannot  pay  claims  described  in  paragraph  4.7. under the MCA if the claim: 30 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 4.8.1.  Is covered by the FTCA, FCA, IACA, 10 USC 2734a and 2734b, Air Force Admiralty Claims Act (AFACA), 10 USC 9801-9804, 9806, NGCA, 32 USC 715, or covered under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’ Claims Act (MPCECA), 31 USC 3701, 3721. 4.8.1.1.  MCA  claims  arising  from  noncombat  activities  in  the  U.S.  are  not  covered  by the FTCA because more elements are needed to state an FTCA claim than are needed to state  a  claim  under  the  MCA  for  noncombat  activities.    All  FTCA  claims  are  based  on elements  of  traditional  tort  liability  (i.e.,  duty,  breach,  causation,  and  damages);  that  is, they  are  fault  based.  Noncombat  activity  claims  under  the  MCA  are  based  solely  on causation  and  damages.    Because  MCA  claims  for  noncombat  activities  are  not  fault based, they are not covered by the FTCA. 4.8.1.2.  Claims for incident-to-service damage to vehicles caused by the negligence of a member  or  employee  of  the  armed  forces  acting  in  the  scope  of  employment  are  paid under the MCA, instead of the MPCECA. 4.8.2.  Arises  with  respect  to  the  assessment  or  collection  of  any  customs  duty,  or  the detention of any goods or merchandise by any U.S. officer of customs or excise, or any other U.S. law enforcement officer.  NOTE:  This includes loss or damage to property detained by members of the Security Forces or Office of Special Investigation (OSI). 4.8.3.  Is cognizable under U.S. admiralty and maritime law, to include: 4.8.3.1.  The Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 USC 30901 and following. 4.8.3.2.  The Death on the High Seas Act, 46 USC 30301 and following. 4.8.3.3.  The Public Vessels Act, 46 USC 31101 and following. EXCEPTION: Claims arising from noncombat activities may be paid under the MCA, even if they are also cognizable under U.S. admiralty and maritime law. 4.8.4.  Arises out of assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, or abuse of process.  EXCEPTION: Unless such actions were committed by an investigative or law enforcement officer of the U.S. who is empowered by law to conduct searches, seize evidence, or make arrests for violations of federal law. 4.8.5.  Arises out of libel, slander, misrepresentation, or deceit. 4.8.6.  Arises out of an interference with contract rights. 4.8.7.  Arises out of the combat activities of U.S. military forces. 4.8.8.

Is for a taking of property, e.g., by technical trespass or over flight of aircraft. 4.8.12.  Is for patent or copyright infringement. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 31 4.8.13.  Results wholly from the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant. 4.8.14.  Is  for  the  reimbursement  of  medical,  hospital,  or  burial  expenses  furnished  at  the expense of the U.S., either directly or through contractual payments. 4.8.15.  Arises  from  contractual agreements, sales agreements, leases, and easements), that: transactions,  express  or implied  (including  rental 4.8.15.1.  Are payable or enforceable under oral or written contracts. 4.8.15.2.  Arise out of an irregular procurement or implied contract. 4.8.16.  Is  for  the  personal  injury  or  death  of  military  or  civilian  personnel  of  a  foreign government incident to their service. 4.8.17.  Is  based  on  an  act  or  omission  of  an  employee  of  the  government,  exercising  due care, in the execution of a statute or regulation,  whether or not such statute or regulation is valid.  Do  not  deny  claims  solely  on  this  exception  without  the  prior  approval  of AFLOA/JACC.  EXCEPTION:  Claims  under  the  noncombat  activities  provision  may  be paid even if this subparagraph applies. 4.8.18.  Is  based  on  the  exercise  or  performance  of,  or  the  failure  to  exercise  or  perform,  a discretionary  function  or  duty  on  the  part  of  a  federal  agency  or  a  federal  government employee, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.

Examples  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  when  a claimant’s criminal conduct or failure to comply with a nonpunitive regulation is a proximate cause  of  the  loss.  Do  not  deny  claims  solely  on  this  exception  without  prior  approval  of AFLOA/JACC. 4.8.20.  Arises out of an act or omission of any employee of the government in administering the provisions of the Trading With the Enemy Act, 50 USC app. 1-44. 4.8.21.

Interpretation of the MCA:  The MCA gives SECAF authority to prescribe regulations, as set  forth  in  this  instruction,  to  implement  the  MCA  in  the  Air  Force.  The  meaning  and construction of the MCA and SECAF’s regulations implementing it are federal  questions to  be AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 33 determined by federal law. Many of the exceptions to payment SECAF has prescribed herein are based upon the wording  of 28 USC 2680, or on  other statutes or court cases. Federal  case law interpreting the same exclusions under the FTCA is applied to the MCA. Where state law differs with federal law, federal law prevails. 4.10.  Applicable Law for Determining Liability and Damages under the MCA: 4.10.1.  For  tort  claims  arising  from  negligent  or  wrongful  acts  or  omissions,  settlement authorities apply these rules: 4.10.1.1.  When  a  claim  arises  in  the  U.S.  or  its  territories  or  possessions,  settlement authorities  apply  the  substantive  law  they  would  use  if  the  claim  was  cognizable  under the FTCA. (T-1) See Chapter 3, paragraph 3.1.2. 4.10.1.2.  In claims arising in foreign countries, settlement authorities apply federal case law interpreting the FTCA.  (T-1) Where the FTCA requires application of the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, settlement authorities use the rules set forth in the currently adopted edition of the Restatement of the Law, published by the American Law Institute, to evaluate the liability of the U.S., (T-1) subject to the following rules: 4.10.1.2.1.  Foreign  rules  and  regulations  governing  the  operation  of  motor  vehicles (rules of the road) are applied to the extent those rules are not specifically superseded or preempted by U.S. military traffic regulations. 4.10.1.2.2.  The principle of absolute or strict liability does not apply. 4.10.1.2.3.  Hedonic damages are not payable. 4.10.1.2.4.  The collateral source doctrine does not apply. 4.10.1.2.5.  Joint  and  several  liability  does  not  apply.    Payment  is  made  based  only upon the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the Armed Forces of the U.S. 4.10.1.2.6.  Future economic losses is discounted to present value after deducting for federal income taxes and, in cases of wrongful death, personal consumption. 4.10.2.  For tort claims arising from noncombat activities, the claimant does not need to show negligence  or  fault,  but  must  establish  causation,  without  regard  to  concepts  of  proximate cause, and damages in accordance with the rules set forth in paragraph 4.8. 4.11.  Acting on Appeals.  A claimant has a statutory right to appeal the denial of claims under the  MCA.  A  settlement  authority  receiving  a  timely  appeal  (within  60  days  after  the  date  of mailing of the final denial, unless the claimant provides good cause): 4.11.1.  Reviews the appeal. (T-1) 4.11.2.  Reaches a final  settlement with the claimant, or forwards the file to the next higher appellate authority with a recommendation for final action. (T-1) 4.11.3.  No settlement authority below AFLOA/JACC or JACE may deny an appeal. 4.11.4.  The following are appellate authorities: 34 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 4.11.4.1.  For  claims  denied  below  AFLOA/JACC  or  JACE,  a  Staff  Attorney  at AFLOA/JACC or JACE, designated as a settlement authority under this instruction or by delegation. 4.11.4.2.  For  claims  denied  by  a  Staff  Attorney  at  AFLOA/JACC  or  JACE,  a  Branch Chief  at  AFLOA/JACC  or  JACE  designated  as  a  settlement  authority  under  this instruction or by delegation. 4.11.4.3.  For  claims  denied  by  a  Branch  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC,  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC; for claims denied by a Branch Chief, AFLOA/JACE, Chief, JACE. 4.11.4.4.  For claims denied by Chief, AFLOA/JACC or JACE, Director, AFLOA/JAC. 4.11.4.5.  For claims denied by Director, AFLOA/JAC, DJAG. 4.11.4.6.  For claims denied by DJAG, TJAG. 4.11.4.7.  For claims denied by TJAG, SECAF or SECAF’s designee. 4.11.5.  Any higher appellate authority may act upon an appeal, e.g., TJAG may act upon an appeal of a claim denied by AFLOA/JAC. However, it is solely within the discretion of the higher appellate authority to do so. 4.12.  Making Advance Payments:  See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.10. 4.13.  Paying MCA Claims.  (T-0). Settlement authorities: 4.13.1.  Pay settlements of $100,000 or less, per claimant, from Air Force claims monies. 4.13.2.  Pay settlements exceeding $100,000 by paying the first $100,000, per claimant, with Air  Force  claims  monies  and  sending  the  remainder  to  the  Department  of  the  Treasury  for payment under 31 USC 1304.  See Chapter 3, paragraph 3.6.3. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 35 Chapter 5 INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT AND FOREIGN CLAIMS Section 5A— 5.1.  Scope  of  this  Chapter.  This chapter implements the FCA, 10 USC 2734; and the IACA, 10 USC 2734a and 2734b; DoD Directive 5515.3; and DoD Instruction 5515.08. Section 5B— 5.2.  General  Discussion.  Given  that  international  agreements  are  rarely  self-executing  under U.S.  law  and  that  the  U.S.  Government  cannot  obligate  funds  without  statutory  authority,  the IACA is  the implementing statute authorizing payment  for  a limited category  of  claims arising under certain  international  agreements.  10 USC 2734a applies to  certain  cases where damages have  been  caused  by  U.S.  forces  abroad,  and  10  USC  2734b  applies  to  certain  cases  where damages have been caused by foreign forces in the United States. 5.3.  IACA Settlement Authority Abroad.  SJAs of the Air Force component commands of the U.S. geographic combatant commands are responsible, within their combatant command AORs, for fulfilling U.S. obligations concerning claims abroad subject to 10 USC 2734a for which the Air  Force  has  settlement  authority.    (T-1)  Consistent  with  10  USC  2734a  and  the  international agreement, they may reimburse or pay the “pro rata share” of a claim as agreed, or if inconsistent with the IACA or the international agreement, they may object to a bill presented. 5.3.1.  IACA  settlement  authority  abroad  may  also  be  exercised  by  SECAF;  TJAG;  DJAG; Director, AFLOA/JAC; and Chief, AFLOA/JACC. 5.3.2.  SJAs  of  the  Air  Force  component  commands  of  the  U.S.  geographic  combatant commands  provide  notice  to  AFLOA/JACC  (Foreign  Claims  Branch)  if  an  objection  is anticipated or planned for an IACA claim abroad for which the Air Force is responsible. (T-1) 5.4.  IACA Claims Abroad Subject to 10 USC 2734a.  Process the tort claim according to the terms  of  the  international  agreement.    (T-0)  Host  nation  law  typically  governs  claims  payable under 10 USC 2734a, and the host nation government is generally responsible for assessing and settling  such  claims  with  investigative  assistance  from  the  U.S.  military  organization  whose personnel  allegedly  caused  the  damages  that  resulted  in  the  claim.    The  U.S.  military  office (“sending  state”  office)  exercising  claims  responsibility  in  the  country  where  the  claim  arose presents  the  claim  to  the  host  nation  government  (if  not  already  in  the  possession  of  the  host nation government) and serves as liaison with the host nation government on matters relating to claim adjudication. (T-1)  Following adjudication, the host nation government (“receiving state” office) provides the sending state office with notice of its denial or a bill requesting appropriate pro rata reimbursement/payment. 5.4.1.  Host nation law may not, in some cases, require notice of a sum certain as part of its formal  claims  protocol.    Consult  host  nation  law  if  a  tort  claim  without  a  sum  certain  is received  and  follow  the  processing  guidance  of  the  sending  state  office  where  the  claim arose. 36 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 5.5.  IACA Claims in the United States Subject to 10 USC 2734b.  Under DoDI 5515.08, the Army  has  exclusive  settlement  authority  for  claims  arising  in  the  United  States  subject  to  10 USC 2734b.  In accordance with Army Regulation 27-20, Legal Services Claims, paragraph 7-8, any  member  or  employee  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Services  who  learns  of  an  incident  in  which  a member of a foreign military force or civilian component may have caused or suffered personal injury,  death,  or  property  damage,  will  immediately  notify  the  judge  advocate  (JA)  or  legal officer at the installation or activity to which such person is assigned or attached.  (T-0) The JA or legal officer receiving such notification will in turn notify the Commander, U.S. Army Claims Service  (USARCS).    (T-0)    Provide  notification  to  AFLOA/JACC  (Foreign  Claims  Branch)  if the member of the foreign military force or civilian component was present in the United States in connection with Air Force activities. (T-1) 5.6.  Redelegating  IACA  Settlement  Authority  Abroad.  When  efficient  for  their  command and beneficial to host nation relations, Air Force component command SJAs may delegate their IACA settlement authority under paragraph 5.3. to a subordinate Air Force legal office SJA. 5.7.  Advance Payments.  If an international agreement governing an IACA claim requires host government adjudication, the host government determines what advance payments may be made. 5.8.  IACA Exclusions.  Do not make reimbursements/payments under 10 USC 2734a if any of the following are applicable: 5.8.1.  The damages occurred in a country that was not a party to the international agreement invoked; 5.8.2.  The international agreement did not provide for settlement or adjudication and pro rata cost-sharing of claims; 5.8.3.  The  claim  did  not  arise  out  of  an  act  or  omission  of  a  military  member  or  civilian employee of the U.S.  Armed Forces done in  the  performance of official  duty or out  of any other  act,  omission,  or  occurrence  for  which  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  is  legally  responsible under the law of the host nation where the damages occurred; 5.8.4.  No damages were caused; 5.8.5.  The  claim  arose  out  of  an  act  of  an  enemy  of  the  United  States  or  arose,  directly  or indirectly,  from  an  act  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces,  or  a  member  thereof,  while  engaged  in ombat; 5.8.6.  The claim is not payable under the terms of the international agreement on account of waiver, hold harmless, or other binding language. 5.9.  Making  Payment.  Air  Force  IACA  claims  arising in  U.S.  Pacific  Command’s (USPACOM’s)  Area  of  Responsibility  (AOR)  are  paid  through  PACAF  finance  channels.    Air Force IACA claims arising elsewhere in the world are paid through the Air Force Claims Service Center.   Air  Force sending state offices comply  with  finance requirements  evidencing the U.S. financial  obligation,  the  amount  to  be  paid,  the  currency  to  be  used,  and  the  host  nation government office to receive the U.S. funds in satisfaction of the international obligation. (T-0) AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 37 Section 5C— 5.10.  General Discussion.  The purpose of the FCA is to promote friendly relations with foreign countries and their inhabitants by paying proper claimants for death, personal injury, or property damage, caused by military members or civilian employees of the U.S. Armed Forces, or arising out of the noncombat activities of such forces. 5.11.  Appointing  FCC.  Only  a  Foreign  Claims  Commission  (FCC)  may  settle  FCA  claims.  Air Force FCC are identified in paragraph 5.12. and may also be appointed through redelegation under paragraph 5.13. 5.11.1.  A judge advocate or civilian attorney of another Military Department is appointed as an Air Force  FCC only  with  concurrence of the  Chief, AFLOA/JACC, and the head of the claims  service  of  the  affected  Military  Department.    (T-1)  Similarly,  a  judge  advocate  or civilian  attorney  of  the  Air  Force  is  appointed  as  an  FCC  for  another  Military  Department only with concurrence of the Chief, AFLOA/JACC, and the head of the claims service of the affected Military Department. (T-0) 5.12.  FCA  Settlement  Authority.  SECAF  may  deny  or  approve  claims  for  any  amount.  For claims  approved  for  more  than  $100,000,  SECAF  or  his  or  her  designee  reports  the  amount  in excess of $100,000 to the Department of the Treasury for payment. (T-1) (See Table A1.2) 5.12.1.  TJAG;  DJAG;  Director,  AFLOA/JAC;  and  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC,  are  FCC  for claims worldwide and may deny claims in any amount, and pay claims filed in any amount when payment is for $100,000 or less. 5.12.2.  The  Associate  Chief,  AFLOA/JACC,  and  the  Chief,  Foreign  Claims  Branch, AFLOA/JACC, are FCC for claims worldwide and may deny claims in any amount, and pay claims filed in any amount, when payment is for $75,000 or less. 5.12.3.  The SJAs of the Air Force component commands of the U.S. geographic combatant commands  are  FCC  for  claims  arising  in  their  respective  combatant  command  AORs  and may deny claims of $50,000 or less, and pay claims filed in any amount when payment is for $50,000 or less. 5.13.  Redelegating  FCA  Settlement  Authority.  Settlement  authorities  may  appoint,  in writing, a subordinate judge advocate or civilian attorney to act as an FCC and redelegate to such persons a portion, or all, of their full authority. 5.14.  FCA Statute of Limitations.  A claimant must present a claim to the United States within two  years  after  it  accrues.    War  or  armed  conflict  does  not  toll  the  statute  of  limitations.    In computing the statutory time period, exclude the incident date and include the date the claim is filed. 5.15.  Presenting Tort Claims.  A claimant or authorized agent must present to the Air Force a properly  signed  Standard  Form  95,  Claim  for  Damage,  Injury,  or  Death,  or  other  signed writing for money damages in a sum certain for damage to or loss of property, personal injury, or death.  For claims presented under the FCA, a claim may be presented orally only if oral claims are  the  custom  in  the  country  where  the  incident  occurred  and  the  claimant  is  functionally illiterate.    In  any  case  where  an  oral  claim  is  made,  the  claim  must  be  promptly  reduced  to writing  with  all  particulars  carefully  noted.    (T-1)  In  exceptional  circumstances  where  no 38 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 signature  is  possible,  some  combination  of  reliable  indicators  confirming  identity  may  be substituted for a valid signature upon approval by AFLOA/JACC. 5.15.1.  Costs of preparing and presenting a claim, such as copying charges, appraisals, and attorneys’ fees, are not payable under the FCA, but may be payable if the claim is settled and paid  by  a  foreign  country  under  an  international  agreement  and  U.S.  payment  is  under  the IACA (see Section 5B). 5.16.  Who Are Proper FCA Claimants.  Proper claimants include foreign country inhabitants who are: 5.16.1.  Foreign nationals. 5.16.1.1.  In a wrongful death case, if the decedent is an inhabitant of a foreign country, even though his or her survivors are U.S. inhabitants, the FCA applies. 5.16.2.  Foreign military personnel, for property damage or loss only. 5.16.3.  U.S.  nationals  residing  abroad,  unless  the  claim  arises  from  a  benefit,  privilege,  or service  provided  to  them  by  the  U.S.  Government,  or  they  reside  in  the  foreign  country primarily  because  they  are  employed  directly  by  the  United  States,  or  sponsored  by  or accompanying such  a person, or  employed by  a  U.S.  civilian contractor in furtherance of a contract with the U.S. Government, or sponsored by or accompanying such a person. 5.16.4.  U.S. corporations with a place of business in the foreign country in which the claim arose. 5.16.5.  Foreign  governments  and  their  political  subdivisions,  including  municipal  and prefectural governments. 5.16.6.  Foreign companies and business entities. 5.17.  Who Are Not Proper FCA Claimants.  Not proper claimants include: 5.17.1.  Insurers or other subrogees. 5.17.2.  Persons  determined  to  be  U.S.  inhabitants.    U.S.  inhabitants  include  dependents  of U.S. military personnel and Federal civilian employees. 5.17.3.  Civilian  employees  of  the  United  States,  including  local  inhabitants,  injured  in  the scope of their employment. 5.17.4.  National  governments  and  their  political  subdivisions  engaging  in  war  or  armed conflict  with  the United  States or its allies.

Such  operations  include,  but  are  not limited  to,  military  exercises  and  United  Nations,  NATO,  and  other  regional  peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 39 5.18.  Investigating and Processing FCA Tort Claims.  Air Force legal personnel charged with investigating  and  processing  FCA  tort  claims  abroad    comply  with  Chapter  2  and  any  other published guidance from AFLOA/JACC (or AFLOA/JACE for environmental tort claims). (T-1)    Chapter  2,  paragraph  2.8  of  this  Instruction  addresses  witness  interviews,  witness  locator information,  documents,  photographs,  legal  memorandum,  and  assembling  tort  claim  files.    In the tort claim file, include copies of international  agreement provisions and relevant extracts of foreign law behind Tab B-7 “Other” (see Attachment 2). (T-1) 5.18.1.  When  conducting  any  investigation,  documents  not  in  English  are  translated  into English by a competent  translator for consideration by the appropriate settlement  authority.  Note the name and phone number of the translator in the claim file. (T-1) 5.18.2.  When  investigating  personal  injury  and  wrongful  death  FCA  claims,  expeditiously document employment and salary history and lost wages, if any, due to inability to work. (T-1) 5.18.3.  When  investigating  personal  injury  and  wrongful  death  cases  claiming  $50,000  or less,  SJAs  exercising  FCA  claims  jurisdiction  should  consider  obtaining  a  legal  opinion  on liability  and  damages  from  a  local  foreign  attorney  knowledgeable  in  tort  law.    When investigating  personal  injury  and  wrongful  death  cases  claiming  more  than  $50,000,  SJAs exercising FCA claims jurisdiction obtain a legal opinion on liability and damages unless the host  nation  where  the  claim  arose  provides  the  Air  Force  with  a  reasonable  assessment  on liability  and  damages.    (T-1)    The  command  responsible  for  the  activities  described  in  the claim bears the cost of the legal opinion. 5.19.  Application of the FCA: 5.19.1.  The incident forming the basis of the FCA claim must: 5.19.1.1.  Arise in a foreign country. 5.19.1.2.  Be  caused  by  noncombat  activities  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces,  as  that  term  is defined  in  Attachment  1,  or  by  the  negligent  or  wrongful  acts  of  civilian  employees  or military members of the U.S. Armed Forces. 5.19.2.  Scope  of  Employment.  Settlement  authorities  may  pay  a  claim  even  if  the  injury results from a criminal act clearly outside the scope of employment. EXCEPTION: Do not pay  claims  arising  outside  the  scope  of  employment  resulting  from  the  acts  of  local  hire civilian  employees,  whether  or  not  those  persons  are  indigenous  persons,  third  country nationals, or U.S. citizens. However, claims arising from the operation of U.S. Armed Forces vehicles or other U.S. Armed Forces equipment by local hire civilian employees are payable, provided the employer or owner of the vehicle or equipment would be liable under local law in the circumstances involved. 5.20.  FCA Exclusions.  An FCA claim is not payable when it: 5.20.1.  Is waived under  an applicable international  agreement, or pursuant  to  an applicable international agreement, a receiving state should adjudicate and pay the claim.  However, if a foreign  government  subject legal responsibilities under the agreement, and the claimant has no other means of compensation, AFLOA/JACC may authorize payment. international  agreement  disputes to  such  an its 5.20.2.  Is purely contractual in nature. 40 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 5.20.3.  Is  for  attorney fees, punitive damages, interest,  bail  costs, or court costs.  To allow claimants  the  opportunity  to  make  a  reasoned  decision  and  to  minimize  misunderstanding, FCC should consider providing early notice to claimants that attorney fees are not payable as an item of damage under the FCA. 5.20.4.  Arises  from  a  private  contractual  relationship  between  U.S.  personnel  and  third parties,  e.g.,  property  leases  (including  damage  covered  by  a  lease  of  real  property),  public utilities, hiring of domestic servants, and debts of any description, including damage to rental vehicles or payment for rental vehicles. 5.20.5.

Is for real property taken by a continuing trespass. 5.20.11.  Is  for personal  injury or death  of  a person covered by the  FECA (5 USC 8101, et seq.);  the  Longshore  and  Harbor  Workers’  Compensation  Act  (33  USC  901,  et  seq.);  or  a U.S.  contract  or  agreement  providing  employee  benefits  through  insurance,  local  law,  or custom, where the U.S. pays for them either directly or as part of the consideration under the contract.  (See  42  USC  1651  and  42  USC  1701.)  AFLOA/JACC  may  authorize  an  award where local benefits under a U.S. contract or agreement are not adequate.  Local benefits are deducted from any award. 5.20.12.  Results from an action by an enemy, or directly or indirectly from an act of the U.S. Armed  Forces  in  combat.  EXCEPTION:  A  claim  may  be  allowed  if  it  arises  from  an accident  or  malfunction  incident  to  the  operation  of  an  aircraft  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces, including its airborne ordnance, indirectly related to combat, and occurring while preparing for, going to, or returning from a combat mission. 5.20.13.

Results wholly from the negligent or wrongful act of the claimant or agent. 5.20.16.  Is  not  in  the  best  interest  of  the  United  States,  is  contrary  to  public  policy,  or otherwise  contrary  to  the  basic  intent  of  the  FCA.  Claims  considered  not  payable  on  this basis are forwarded to AFLOA/JACC for final decision. 5.20.17.  Is presented by a national, or a corporation controlled by a national, of a country at war  or  engaged  in  armed  conflict  with  the  United  States,  or  any  country  allied  with  such enemy country unless the settlement authority determines the claimant is, and at the time of the incident was, friendly to the United States. EXCEPTION: A prisoner of war or interned AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 41 enemy alien is not excluded from filing a claim for damage, loss, or destruction of personal property within the U.S. Armed Forces’ custody if the claim is otherwise payable. 5.20.18.  Is  the  subject  of  litigation  against  the  United  States,  or  its  employees.    This restriction  does  not  apply  to  joint  criminal/civil  proceedings  in  a  foreign  court.    Claims settlement may be authorized by AFLOA/JACC in appropriate cases on request. 5.20.19.  Is  covered  under  U.S.  admiralty  and  maritime  laws,  unless  authorized  by AFLOA/JACC. 5.20.20.  Is  filed  by  a  Communist  country  or  its  inhabitants,  unless  authorized  by AFLOA/JACC. 5.21.  Applicable Law for Determining Liability and Damages under the FCA.  Federal law, through the FCA, gives SECAF authority to prescribe the regulations set forth in this Instruction. This  authority  includes  the  appointment  of  an  FCC  and  the  implementation  of  the  FCA  by  the Air Force. 5.21.1.  In  adjudicating  FCA  claims,  settlement  authorities  follow  the  law,  customs,  and standards of the country where the claim arose (T-0)  except: 5.21.1.1.  Causation is determined based upon general principles of U.S. tort law found in federal case law and standard legal publications. 5.21.1.2.  Joint  and  several  liability  does  not  apply.    Payment  is  based  solely  on  the portion of loss, damage, injury or death attributable to the U.S. Armed Forces. 5.21.1.3.  If lost income or lost profits is recoverable under the law where the claim arose, they shall be limited to net lost income or net lost profits, taking into account appropriate deductions  for  taxes,  regular  business  expenditures,  and  in  the  case  of  wrongful  death, personal consumption during the loss period. 5.21.2.  Settlement authorities do not deduct compensation from collateral sources except for: 5.21.2.1.  Direct payments by a member or civilian employee of the U.S. Armed Forces for damages (not solatia) (See Section 5D). 5.21.2.2.  Any  payments  recovered  or  recoverable  from  an  insurance  policy  when premiums were paid, directly or indirectly, by the United States, or a member or civilian employee of the U.S. Armed Forces; or when the member or employee has the benefit of the  insurance  (such  as  when  a  U.S.  member  or  employee  borrows  a  vehicle  of  a  local national, and the vehicle carries insurance for the benefit of any driver with permission to drive the vehicle). 5.21.2.3.  Any  workers  compensation  payments  paid  or  payable  to  the  claimant  by  a foreign government. 5.22.  Acting  on  FCA  Reconsideration.  Chapter  2,  paragraph  2.12  governs  reconsideration under the FCA.  The FCA provides no statutory right to appeal. 5.23.  Making Advance Payments under the FCA:  See Chapter 2, paragraph 2.10. 5.24.  Rights  of  Subrogation,  Indemnity,  and Contribution.  The Air Force has all the rights of  subrogation,  indemnity,  and  contribution,  as  local  law  permits.    However,  settlement authorities  do  not  seek  contribution  or  indemnity  from  U.S.  military  members  or  civilian 42 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 employees  whose  conduct  gave  rise  to  U.S.  government  liability,  or  whenever  it  would  be harmful to international relations. 5.25.  Paying  FCA  Claims.  (T-0).    FCA  payments  are  ex  gratia  and  within  the  discretion  of SECAF or his or her designee.  FCA claims are adjudicated, approved, and paid in the currency of the country where the incident occurred.  EXCEPTION: If claimant is a foreign inhabitant of another country, payment may be made using the currency of the country where claimant resides.  Do not pay in a currency other than that of the country where the incident occurred without the permission of AFLOA/JACC. 5.25.1.  Air  Force  FCA  claims  arising  in  USPACOM’s  AOR  are  paid  through  PACAF finance channels.  Air Force FCA claims arising elsewhere in the world are paid through the Air Force Claims Service Center.   Pay settlements  of $100,000 or less, pjer claimant, from Air Force claims monies. Pay settlements exceeding $100,000 by paying the first $100,000, per claimant, with Air Force claims monies and by paying the remainder under 31 USC 1304 in  accordance  with  foreign  currency  payment  requirements  of  the  Judgment  Fund  Group, Department  of the Treasury,  Financial Management Service, Prince George’s Metro Center 2, 3700 East-West Highway, Rm 6F03, Hyattsville, MD 20782. Section 5D— 5.26.  General  Discussion.  A  solatium  payment  is  a  nominal  payment  made  immediately  to  a victim or a victim’s family to express sympathy when local custom exists for such a payment.  It is  not  compensation;  it  is  not  subject  to  single  service  claims  responsibility;  and  in  two  of  the three  countries  in  the  Far  East  where  it  is  bona  fide  custom,  payment  is  governed  by  military regulation (Korea, Japan).  Solatia payments are not made from appropriated claim funds.  They are made from the personal funds of a tortfeasor or from non-claims Operation and Maintenance (O&M) appropriations of the Military Department involved in an incident. 5.27.  Problematic Solatia Payments.  Although it is appropriate to honor the custom of solatia in  countries  where  it  is  an  established  custom  governed  by  military  regulation,  it  is  equally critical that the United States avoid this practice where no proof of custom exists and the offer of a  truly  nominal  payment  risks,  not  only  creating  new  fiscal  obligations,  but  also  converting already  tragic  situations  into  greater  offenses.    Moreover,  solatia  (payable  or  not)  is  not  a substitute for expeditious processing of meritorious claims under the FCA, and if a complicated meritorious  claim  presents  immediate  needs,  the  Advance  Payments  Act  is  available  to  meet such  needs.  See  Chapter  2,  paragraph  2.10.    Outside  Korea,  Japan,  and  Thailand,  an  FCC consults  with  AFLOA/JACC  (Foreign  Claims  Branch)  before  making  any  solatia  payment  in connection with any potential or actual Air Force claim. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 43 Chapter 6 NONAPPROPRIATED FUND, AIR NATIONAL GUARD, CIVIL AIR PATROL, ADMIRALTY, AND MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS Section A— 6.1.  Scope of this Chapter. 6.1.1.  This chapter contains procedures for settling: 6.1.1.1.  Nonappropriated fund instrumentality (NAFI) claims. 6.1.1.2.  Civil Air Patrol (CAP) claims. 6.1.1.3.  Claims under the National Guard Claims Act (NGCA), 32 USC 715. 6.1.1.4.  Claims  under  the  Air  Force  Admiralty  Claims  Act  (AFACA),  10  USC  9801-9804, 9806. 6.1.1.5.

Air  Force  installation  legal  personnel  receiving  claims  outside  the  coverage  of  this instruction coordinate with AFLOA/JACC to determine which federal agency should process the claim and under which statute the claim should be adjudicated. (T-1) Section B— 6.2.  Scope of this Section.  This section implements DoD Directive 5515.6, Processing Claims Arising Out of Operations of Nonappropriated Fund Activities, dated 31 October 2006. 6.3.  Settling  NAFI  Claims.  Settle NAFI  claims  in  accordance with  Chapters 1 through 5 and this section. 6.4.  Settlement  Authority.  The  settlement  authority  for  NAFI  tort  claims  is  the  same  as  the authority  listed  in  the  particular  chapter  of  this  instruction  under  which  the  Air  Force  settles claims alleging negligence by appropriated fund employees (e.g., FTCA, MCA). The decision of the settlement authority is binding upon the NAFI. 6.5.  Notice  of  Claim.  Upon  receiving  a  NAFI  tort  claim,  the  claims  office  promptly  sends  a copy  of  the  claim  to  Headquarters,  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service,  Financial Management & Accounting Directorate (T-1): ATTN:  FA-T/RM, P.O. Box 650428, Dallas, TX 75265-0428; or to USAF/JAA-S, 2261 Hughes Avenue, Suite 156, Lackland AFB TX 78236, as appropriate.  Proof that notice has been provided to the appropriate NAFI is placed in the claim file. (T-3) 6.6.  Payment of Claims. 44 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 6.6.1.  Pay claims from the fund source that pays the individual whose conduct gave rise to the claim. (T-0) 6.6.1.1.  Use  only  nonappropriated  funds  to  pay  an  administrative  settlement,  or  a judgment  resulting  from  a  lawsuit,  when  the  alleged  negligent  conduct  was  that  of  a nonappropriated fund employee. 6.6.1.2.  Settlement  agreements  for  claims  involving  NAFIs  contain  a  release  of nonappropriated fund employees, as well as the U.S., its agents, servants, and employees. 6.6.1.3.  Military personnel or appropriated fund civilian employees performing off-duty, part-time  work,  and  receiving  NAFI  pay  for  their  duties,  are  nonappropriated  fund employees for claims arising out of their off-duty work. 6.6.1.4.  Claims involving volunteers.  10 USC 1588, as implemented by DoDI 1100.21, states  that  volunteers  are  considered  employees  of  the  government  for  tort  claims purposes.  Whether  a  volunteer  who  causes  a  tort  is  deemed  a  NAFI  employee  or Appropriated Fund employee depends on the type of activity the volunteer is supporting. Refer  to  AFI  65-106,  Appropriated  Fund  Support  of  Morale,  Welfare,  and  Recreation (MWR)  and  Nonappropriated  Fund  Instrumentalities  (NAFIS),  for  the  different categories  of  NAFI  activities:  Mission  Sustaining  (Category  A),  Basic  Community Support  Activities  (Category  B)  and  Revenue  Generating  Activities  (Category  C).  Volunteers supporting Category A or B activities at the time of the incident giving rise to the  tort  are  deemed  appropriated  fund  employees.  Volunteers  supporting  Category  C activities  at  the  time  of  the  incident  giving  rise  to  the  tort  are  deemed  nonappropriated fund employees. 6.6.2.  Send  claims  for  payment  involving  the  Army  and  Air  Force  Exchange  Service (AAFES) to the address listed in paragraph 6.5. (T-1) 6.6.3.  Send claims for payment involving all other Air Force NAFIs as follows: 6.6.3.1.  For  payments  over  $500.00,  send  to  AFPC/SVXB,  at  the  address  listed  in paragraph 6.5. (T-1) 6.6.3.2.  For  payments  of  $500.00  and  under,  send  to  the  local  NAFI  that  employs  (or employed) the NAFI employee whose conduct gave rise to the claim. (T-1) 6.7.  Claims Not Payable: 6.7.1.  Claims arising out of the operation of a NAFI activity caused by military personnel or appropriated fund civilian employees performing assigned Air Force duties, even though they benefit  a  NAFI  activity.    For  such  claims,  adjudicate  and,  if  appropriate,  settle  them  with appropriated funds. 6.7.2.  Claims for personal injury or death of NAFI employees arising out of performance of their duties. 6.7.3.  Claims that NAFI concessionaires or other contractors cause. 6.7.4.  Claims arising out of the activities of private organizations. 6.7.5.  Claims arising out of NAFI activities involving contract disputes, dishonored checks, debts to NAFIs, or third party workers’ compensation claims. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 45 6.8.  Customer  Complaints.  Do  not  process  under  this  section  complaints  or  claims  for personal  property  loss  or  damage  by  NAFI  customers  that  the  local  NAFI  activity  can satisfactorily  resolve.    The  manager  of  a  NAFI  activity  may  seek  the  advice  of  the  local  SJA when deciding the merits of a customer complaint. 6.9.  NAFI  Insurance  Claims.  AFLOA/JACC may settle under this chapter claims arising out of the activities of the authorized users of a NAFI program,  such as an aero club or marina, on behalf of the NAFI self-insurance program. Section C— 6.10.  Scope of this Section.  Settlement authorities may settle claims for death, personal injury, or property damage arising out of the authorized noncombat activities of the Air National Guard (ANG) under the NGCA, 32 USC 715. 6.10.1.  Settlement  authorities  settle  claims  involving  ANG  personnel,  other  than  claims arising out of noncombat activities, in accordance with Chapters 1 through 5 and this section. (T-1) 6.11.  Settlement Authority:  (See Table A1.2) 6.11.1.  SECAF may deny or approve claims for any amount.

Settlement authorities process claims arising out of the activities of ANG technicians employed under 32 USC 709 under the FTCA or the MCA. 6.12.3.  Claims arising out of the activities of ANG personnel while under state orders are not cognizable under federal claims statutes. SJAs refer such claims to state authorities. 6.13.  Who are Proper Claimants.  Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.4. for proper claimants. 6.14.  Who are Not Proper Claimants.  Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.5 for entities that are not proper claimants. 46 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 6.15.  NGCA  Exclusions.  Refer  to  Chapter  4,  paragraph  4.8  for  exclusions  from  payment under the NGCA. 6.16.  Interpretation of the NGCA.  Interpret the NGCA the same way as the MCA with regard to noncombat activity claims. Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.9. (T-0) 6.17.  Applicable Law for  Determining Liability under the NGCA.

The  federal  government  may  be  held  liable  for  the  negligent  or wrongful  acts  or  omissions  of  CAP  or  its  members  when  performing  Air  Force-assigned missions causing personal injury, death, or property damage. 6.23.1.  Air Force-assigned missions may include those in support of other federal agencies. 6.23.2.  Instrumentality Status. CAP and its members are an instrumentality of the U.S. when they are performing Air Force-assigned missions under the Cooperative Agreement between the U.S. Air Force and the Civil Air Patrol. When CAP engages in activities other than Air Force-assigned missions, it is acting as a private corporation. 6.24.  Settling  Claims.  Settlement  authorities  (SECAF;  TJAG;  DJAG;  Director  AFLOA/JAC; and  Chief  and  Branch  Chiefs,  AFLOA/JACC)  settle  CAP  tort  claims  arising  out  of  Air  Force-assigned  missions  in  accordance  with  the  FTCA  (Chapter  3)  or  the  AFACA  (Chapter  6, Section  E),  as  appropriate.  (T-0)  Settlement  authorities  below  AFLOA/JACC  may  not  deny  or pay CAP claims. 6.25.  Notice of Claim.  Consult AFLOA/JACC upon receiving a claim arising out of any CAP activity. (T-1) AFLOA/JACC may ask the base legal office to contact HQ CAP-USAF/JA, 105 South Hansell St, Maxwell AFB, AL 36112-6332, for a determination as to whether the activity in which the CAP member was engaged was an Air Force-assigned mission. 6.26.  Proper  Claims.  Proper  claims  are  those  in  which  the  negligence  or  wrongful  acts  or omissions  of  CAP  members  performing  Air  Force-assigned  missions  causes  personal  injury, death, or property damage. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 47 6.27.  Improper Claims: 6.27.1.  Claims arising out of CAP corporate activities. 6.27.2.  Claims  for  personal  injury  or  death  of  CAP  members,  18  years  of  age  or  older, covered by the FECA (5 USC 8101, et seq.). 6.27.3.  Claims  for  use  of  privately  owned  property  that  CAP  or  its  members  use  on  Air Force-assigned missions. 6.27.4.  Claims for expenses CAP or its members incur while engaged in Air Force-assigned missions. Section E— 6.28.  Scope  of  this  Section.  This  section implements  the AFACA, 10  USC 9801-9804, 9806, and the Admiralty Extension Act, 46 USC 30101. 6.29.  Settlement Authority:  (See Table A1.2) 6.29.1.  For Claims Against the U.S.: 6.29.1.1.  SECAF may deny or approve claims in any amount, but if a claim is settled for more than $500,000, he/she certifies the claim to Congress. (T-0) 6.29.1.2.

Statute of Limitations. 6.30.1.  Claims Against the U.S.: 6.30.1.1.  A  claimant  must  agree  to  accept  a  settlement,  and  the  appropriate  settlement authority  must  approve  the  settlement  for  payment,  within  two  years  from  the  date  the 48 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 cause of action accrued. The Air Force has no authority to settle or pay any claim under the AFACA after the expiration of this two-year period. 6.30.1.2.  Neither the filing of a claim nor its consideration by the Air Force, to include settlement negotiations or related correspondence, waives or extends the two-year statute of limitation period for filing suit under 46 USC 30901 or 46 USC 31101. 6.30.1.3.  Filing an administrative claim prior to suit is required only when the damage or injury to person or property is caused by a vessel on navigable water, but the damage or injury is done or consummated on land.  In such cases, the claimant may not file suit until six months after filing the claim in writing  with the federal agency owning or operating the vessel. 6.30.2.  Claims  in  Favor  of  the  U.S.:    Claims  in  favor  of  the  U.S.  are  barred  unless  a complaint is filed within: 6.30.2.1.  Three years for tort actions (28 USC 2415(b)). 6.30.2.2.

Towage or salvage services the Air Force performs. Section F— 6.34.  Scope of this Section.  This section implements 10 USC 2737, and explains how to settle claims  against  the  U.S.  for  property  damage,  personal  injury,  or  death  incident  to  the  use  of  a government  vehicle,  or  any  other  government  property  on  a  government  installation,  when  the claim is not payable under any other statute. Claims may be paid under this section whether or not the member or employee is acting in the scope of employment. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 49 6.35.  Settlement  Authority.  Anyone  with  settlement  authority  under  Chapters  1  through  6  of this Instruction (see Table A1.2) may: 6.35.1.  Deny claims in any amount. 6.35.2.  Pay claims filed in any amount but with payment not to exceed $1,000. 6.36.  Payable Claims.  When all of the following are present, payment of a claim in the amount of $1,000 or less is authorized: 6.36.1.  The claim is for property damage, personal injury, or death. Payment for a personal injury or death claim is limited to costs of reasonable medical, hospital, and burial expenses actually incurred, and not otherwise furnished or paid by the U.S. 6.36.2.  A military member or civilian employee of the Air Force caused the damage, injury or death, whether acting within or outside the scope of employment. 6.36.3.  The damage, injury or death arose from the use of a government vehicle at any place or from the use of other government property on a government installation. 6.37.  Claims Not Payable.  A claim is not payable if it is: 6.37.1.  Payable under any other provision of law. 6.37.2.  Caused  wholly  or  partly  by  a  negligent  or  wrongful  act  of  the  claimant,  the claimant’s agent, or employee. 6.37.3.  A subrogated claim. 6.37.4.  Recoverable  from  other  sources  such  as  an  insurance  policy,  or  recovered  from action under Article 139, UCMJ. 6.37.5.  For pain and suffering. Section G— 6.38.  Scope  of  this  Section.  This  section  implements  10  USC  2738,  which  allows  Air  Force members  to  be  reimbursed  for  household  effects  lost  during  a  move  incident  to  a  permanent change of station.  SECAF determines the loss of the household effects is due to a hostile action incident to war or a warlike action by a military force. 6.39.  Settlement  Authority.  SECAF;  TJAG;  DJAG;  Director,  AFLOA/JAC;  and  Chief  and Branch Chiefs, AFLOA/JACC may deny claims in any amount and approve claims in an amount not to exceed $100,000, notwithstanding the amount claimed (see Table A1.2). 6.40.  Statute  of  Limitations.  A  claim  must  be  presented  in  writing  to  the  appropriate  federal agency  within two  years of accrual,  unless the U.S. is  at  war or in  an  armed conflict  when the claim accrues, or the U.S. enters a war or armed conflict after the claim accrues, and good cause is shown. 6.40.1.  A  claim  normally  accrues  at  the  time  of  injury  when  essential  operative  facts  are apparent. 6.40.2.  In computing the statutory time period, exclude the date of the incident and include the date the claim was presented. 50 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 6.41.  Who are Proper Claimants: 6.41.1.  Members of the Armed Forces of the U.S. 6.41.2.  Members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or of the Public Health  Service  serving  within  the  Department  of  Defense.  Treat  them  as  if  they  were  a member of the Armed Forces. 6.42.  Payable Claims.  Losses of household effects sustained during a move made incident to a permanent  change  of  station  when,  as  determined  by  SECAF,  the  loss  was  caused  by  a  hostile action  incident  to  war  or  a  warlike  action  by  a  military  force.  A  claim  is  payable  only  to  the extent the loss is not reimbursed under insurance or under the authority of another provision of law. 6.43.  Substantiation.  Claimants substantiate their claims as  required for MPCECA claims for transportation loss of personal property under AFI 51-502. 6.44.  Action by Settlement Authorities.  A settlement authority takes final action on all claims where  the  amount  claimed  or  the  negotiated  settlement  is  within  its  delegated  settlement authority. (T-1) Refer to Chapter 2, paragraph 2.9. 6.45.  Acting on Appeals.  A claimant has a statutory right to appeal the denial of claims under 10 USC 2738 and 10 USC 2733(g). Refer to Chapter 4, paragraph 4.11. 6.46.  Payment.  Pay settlements from Air Force claims funds. Section H— S. Postal Service (USPS)  6.47.  Scope  of  this  Section.  The  Air  Force  reimburses  the  USPS  for  the  loss  of  postal  funds, property,  and accountable mail  due to  negligence, error or theft by Air Force postal  personnel.  This  section  implements  USPS  Publication  38,  Postal  Agreement  with  the  Department  of Defense, February, 1980. 6.47.1.  Claims  are  submitted  by  the  USPS  through  the  Military  Postal  Service  Agency, which forwards the claims directly to AFLOA/JACC. 6.47.2.  TJAG; DJAG; Director, AFLOA/JAC; and Chief and Branch Chiefs, AFLOA/JACC, are authorized to settle USPS claims in any amount, and to seek recovery from the offender  (see Table A1.2). 6.47.3.  Claims  involving  third  party  mail  loss  or  damage  caused  by  other  Air  Force personnel, such as unit mail clerks or truck drivers, are processed under the MCA or FTCA. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 51 Chapter 7 MEDICAL COST REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS Section 7A— 7.1.  Scope.  This  chapter  explains  how  the  U.S.  asserts  and  settles  claims  for  costs  of  medical care  against  third  parties  under  the  Federal  Medical  Care  Recovery  Act  (FMCRA),  42  USC 2651-2653;  the Coordination of Benefits  (COB) Statute, 10 USC 1095, 1095a, and 1095b;  and other laws. This chapter also explains how the U.S. asserts and settles claims for accrued pay to members  during  periods  of  disability  under  the  FMCRA.  Refer  to  claims  under  this  chapter  as Medical Cost Reimbursement “MCR” claims. 7.2.  Settlement  Authority.  TJAG  delegates  to  DJAG,  AFLOA/JAC,  AFLOA/JACC,  and  the Chief, MCRP (see Table A1.2) the authority to: 7.2.1.  Accept the full amount of a MCR claim and execute a release. 7.2.2.  Compromise, settle, or waive any claim for $300,000 or less. 7.2.3.  Negotiate settlement, compromise, or waiver of claims exceeding $300,000, subject to the approval of DoJ. 7.2.4.  Redelegate a portion or all of their authority to subordinates, subject to the following limitations: 7.2.4.1.  SJAs,  when  given  MCR  claims  jurisdiction,  are  granted  authority  to  waive, compromise,  or  settle  claims  in  amounts  of  $25,000  or  less.  This  authority  may  be  re-delegated in writing with authority to re-delegate to subordinates. 7.2.4.2.  SJAs of numbered Air Forces, when given MCR claims jurisdiction, are granted authority  to  waive,  compromise,  or  settle  claims  in  amounts  of  $40,000  or  less.  This authority may be re-delegated in writing with authority to re-delegate to subordinates. 7.2.5.  Claims  with  an  amount  in  excess  of  their  settlement  authority  are  forwarded  to  the next  higher  settlement  authority  for  review  and  decision,  and,  if  required,  to  DoJ.    No settlement  authority  may  exercise  its  authority  to  waive,  compromise,  or  settle  a  claim  that has been referred to DoJ or when a suit, naming the U.S. as a party, has been filed. 7.3.  Terms.  When used in this chapter, these terms have the following meanings: 7.3.1.  An “injured party” is the person who received medical care for an injury or disease on which  the  claim  is  based.  The  injured  party  may  be  represented  by  a  guardian,  personal representative, estate, survivor, or attorney. 7.3.2.  The  term  “third  party”  refers  to  an  individual,  partnership,  business,  corporation, insurer,  or  other  entity,  which  is  indebted  or  otherwise  responsible  to  the  U.S.  for  medical care  or  accrued  pay  for  an  injured  party.  In  appropriate  cases  the  third  party  may  be  a governmental entity. 7.3.3.  The term “tortfeasor” refers to a wrongdoer who commits a wrongful act that injures another for which the law provides a legal right to seek relief. 52 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 7.3.4.  “Medical  care”  includes  medical  and  dental  treatment,  prescription  medication, prostheses,  and  medical  appliances  the  U.S.  furnished  or  reimbursed  other  sources  for providing. 7.3.5.  “Accrued pay” is the total of all pay accrued to the account of an active duty member during a period when the member is  unable to  perform military duties.   It does not  include allowances. 7.3.6.  “Future  care”  is  medical  care  reasonably  expected  to  be  provided  or  paid  for  in  the future treatment of an injured party as determined during the investigative process. 7.4.  Program  Generally.  All  claims  asserted  under  this  Chapter  are  processed  by  those  with MCR  authority  having  geographic  responsibility  for  the  location  of  the  accident/incident  that necessitated medical care. 7.4.1.  The  Chief,  MCRP  Branch,  determines  and  assigns  geographic  responsibility  for  all MCRP regional field offices. (T-1) 7.4.2.  If  there  is  a  change  in  geographic  responsibility,  the  MCRP  regional  field  office assigned  new  geographic  responsibility  coordinates  with  the  MCRP  regional  field  office transferring  geographic  responsibility  to  notify  all  injured  parties,  attorneys,  insurance companies,  medical  care  providers,  medical  facility  registrars  and  patient  affairs representatives,  Medical  Treatment  Facility  (MTF)  resource  management  offices  and TRICARE  contractors,  as  necessary,  of  the  change  of  geographic  responsibility.  (T-1)  The regional field office also notifies these entities as to whether a claim has been transferred and provide a point of contact at the regional field office for each transferred claim. (T-1) 7.5.  Assertable  Claims,  Generally.  Assert  a  claim  only  if  those  with  MCR  authority,  having been  assigned  a  case  to  investigate  and  research,  determine  that  it  merits  assertion.  If  the Government  has  furnished  or  will  furnish  medical  care  in  military  health  care  facilities,  or  has reimbursed  a  civilian  healthcare  provider  who  has  provided  care  to  an  Air  Force  affiliated member and their dependents, a claim may be asserted under this chapter under: 7.5.1.  FMCRA,  when  a  third  party  is  liable  in  tort  for  causing  an  injury  or  disease  and, therefore,  is  liable  for  the  cost  of  the  medical  care  provided.  The  U.S.  is  also  authorized under the FMCRA to collect an amount equal to the accrued pay of the injured party during any period that the military member is unable to perform military duties. 7.5.2.  COB,  when  a  third  party  payer  is  responsible  for  payment  (such  as  a  workers’ compensation  claim,  medical  payment  coverage,  uninsured  or  underinsured  motorist coverage, or any no-fault coverage under state law). The term “third party payer” is defined in the COB statute and/or regulations implementing it. 7.5.3.  Any other Federal, State, or foreign law that would permit the U.S. to recover. 7.6.  FMCRA or COB.  MCR authorities can often assert claims under both FMCRA and COB. Whether a claim may be asserted against different parties under different statutes or against one party  under  both,  use  and  cite  the  applicable  statute(s)  to  all  potential  parties.  This  serves  to maximize claims recovery. 7.7.  Minimum Claims Value.  In keeping with the Air Force policy of aggressive collection of pro-Government claims, each settlement authority may assert a claim in any amount. However, AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 53 settlement  authorities  only  assert  those  claims  for  $150  or  less  in  which  one  of  the  following apply: 7.7.1.  The amount collected exceeds the cost to collect. (T-1) 7.7.2.  The third party offers payment. (T-1) 7.7.3.  The  U.S.  has  asserted  a  property  damage  claim  under  Chapter  9  of  this  Instruction arising out of the same incident. (T-1) 7.8.  Nonassertable  Claims.  Settlement  authorities do not  assert MCR claims in  the following circumstances: 7.8.1.  Federal  Agencies.  Do  not  assert  claims  against  any  department,  agency,  or instrumentality  of  the  U.S.,  unless  permitted  by  statute,  regulation,  or  policy.  Secretary  of Defense  Policy  for  MTF  billing  should  be  used  to  establish  policy  for  collection  of TRICARE fees. Extend this guidance to include any related treatment paid for by TRICARE when  asserting  the  claim.    When  reviewing  bills  for  submission  to  agencies  of  the  U.S., ensure proper rates are used.  Generally, federal agencies are billed at interagency rates.  See current Secretary of Defense Policy or contact MCRP for further guidance. 7.8.2.  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Services. Do not assert claims for care the VA provides a veteran for a service-connected disability. This does not prevent the assertion of a claim  against  a  liable  third  party  for  medical  care  an  Air  Force  member  received  prior  to discharge and transfer to  the VA facility or when the Air Force reimbursed the VA facility for the care. 7.8.3.  Merchant Seamen. Do not assert claims for care the U.S. furnishes a merchant seaman in accordance with 42 USC 249. Do not file a claim against the seaman’s employer. 7.8.4.  Contractors to be reimbursed by the Government under contract. If the U.S. needs to reimburse  a  contractor  for  a  claim  according  to  the  terms  of  the  contract,  settlement authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the incident to determine if assertion is appropriate. If necessary, the MCR authority can request a review of the contract by the SJA to determine the feasibility of asserting such a claim. If the U.S. is not required to reimburse the contractor, the MCR authority may assert a claim against the contractor. 7.8.5.  Claims  occurring  outside  the  U.S.    The  responsibility  for  investigating  MCR  claims occurring  outside  the  U.S.  lies  with  designees  of  USAFE,  USEUCOM,  AFNORTH, AFSOUTH,  AFAFRICA,  PACAF,  or  AFCENT.  Settlement  authorities  investigate  any claims  that  might  be  made  against  foreign  governments,  their  political  subdivisions,  armed forces members, or civilian employees. 7.8.6.  Government  Personnel.  Generally, settlement  authorities do not  assert claims against members of the uniformed services, employees of the U.S., its agencies or instrumentalities, except as noted in paragraph 7.8.1 above, or a dependent of a service member or employee. Consult the regional attorney if assistance is required. 7.8.6.1.  Settlement authorities may assert claims against such persons if: 7.8.6.1.1.  They have insurance to  cover the Air Force’s claim, i.e. medical payment insurance, renters insurance, first party insurance, and underinsured insurance; 54 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 7.8.6.1.2.  They  were  required  by  law  or  regulation  to  have  insurance  which  would have covered the Air Force loss; or 7.8.6.1.3.  Their  actions,  which  necessitated  the  medical  treatment  provided  at government expense, constituted willful misconduct or gross negligence. 7.8.6.2.  Notwithstanding  the  above  exceptions,  no  claim  under  this  chapter  should  be asserted  against  a  federal  employee  or  military  member  if  the  relevant  actions  were performed  in  the  course  of  official  duty  or  scope  of  employment.  MCR  personnel  send copies of files for potential  claims against non-Air Force,  active-duty military members or civilian employees to the military service concerned when they involve official duty or scope of employment issues. These issues are resolved by the other service. 7.8.7.  Products  Liability.  Due  to  the  unique  nature  of  product  liability  issues  and  claims litigation, MCRP regional managers seek approval from regional attorneys before asserting a claim  using  a  products  liability  theory  of  recovery.  The  regional  attorney  coordinates  with Chief, MCRP, regarding whether or not to assert product liability claims. 7.8.8.  Third  Party  Collections  (TPC).  MCR  authorities  and  MCRP  regional  offices  do  not get  involved  with  processing,  reviewing,  or  settling  TPC  claims,  which  are  active  MTF programs for asserting and collecting claims against health plans for inpatient and outpatient care. 7.9.  Medical Cost Reimbursement Claims Required.  Each MCR authority ensures that his or her personnel  promptly  discovers all potential  MCR claims and fully investigate, research,  and vigorously  pursue  claims  until  collected  and/or  resolved.  This  requires  both  a  network  of contacts  with  appropriate  offices  and  knowing  and  monitoring  traditional  sources  of  MCR claims, as set forth below: 7.9.1.  Network of Contacts.  Because of the difficult task of identifying all potential claims, the MCR authorities and staff should establish and maintain a network of contacts throughout all  affiliated  base  communities  to  bring  potential  claims  to  the  attention  of  the  MCR authorities. Base contacts can provide potential claims from a variety of sources, including: 7.9.1.1.  Medical  facility  registrars  and  patient  affairs  representatives.  Medical  facility registrars and patient affairs representatives advise the MCR authorities of potential third-party liability claims arising from injuries resulting from incidents such as motor vehicle accidents.  Other  medical  clinics  such  as  physical  therapy,  orthopedics,  and  dental  are another source for potential claims. A screening of patient records by staff in these clinics may  provide  a  source  of  potential  claims.  This  notification  is  made  on  AF  Form  1488, Daily Log of Patients Treated for  Injuries, or  AF  Form 438,  Medical Care Third-Party Liability Notification. 7.9.1.2.  MTF  resource  management  offices  and  TRICARE  contractors.  Managed  care contractors  and TRICARE fiscal  intermediaries provide copies of paid  bills  for military members treated in private facilities. 7.9.1.3.  Healthcare  providers.    Healthcare  providers  can  be  very  useful  in  identifying potential  claims  that  were  not  identified  during  emergent  care  or  where  emergent  care was provided in another facility. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 55 7.9.1.4.  Other  military  legal  offices.  Other  military  legal  offices  are  often  a  source  for potential  claims.  Where  care  is  provided  at  other  military  medical  facilities,  their supporting  legal  office  may  be  notified  of  a  claim  within  another  jurisdiction.  Often, private  attorneys  who  are  familiar  with  one  legal  office  (such  as  an  office  of  another military service) contact that office regarding a claim within the other jurisdiction. 7.9.1.5.  Other MCR authority offices. Other MCR authorities determine the jurisdiction of  an  accident/incident  and  coordinate  with  the  proper  MCR  authority  POC  for processing of potential claims that fall within their jurisdiction. 7.9.1.6.  Commanders and First Sergeants. Commanders and First Sergeants are generally aware of medical treatment required by their Airmen and also generally know the cause of the injury or illness.  When properly  cultivated, Commanders and First  Sergeants  can be a source for identifying potential claims. 7.9.2.  Historic  Sources  of  MCR  Claims.  Knowing  and  monitoring  the  historic  sources  of MCR  claims  is  vital  to  any  MCRP.  It  allows  the  regional  field  office  to  identify  potential claims and train others to properly identify and timely refer the same.  Such sources include: 7.9.2.1.  Other  Federal  medical  facilities.  Sometimes  our  patients  are  treated  at  other Federal  medical  facilities.  Often  these  facilities  have  a  claims  function  to  identify potential  claims.  Coordination  with  these  facilities  can  ensure  proper  referral  to  the military claims office of potential claims. 7.9.2.2.  Security  Forces  desk  blotters.  Base  legal  offices  review  security  forces  desk blotters  for  the  potential  MCR  claims  or  forward  daily  blotters  to  their  regional  MCRP office for screening. (T-1) Personnel are trained to screen for potential MCR claims and notify the regional MCRP office when a potential claim is identified or to refer the blotter to MCRP personnel for screening. (T-1) 7.9.2.3.  Medical  record  requests.  When  medical  records  are  requested  by  outside sources,  especially  attorneys,  medical  personnel  provide  copies  of  all  documents  to  be sent to the requestor for MCR review. (T-0) A part of the review should be to determine if the record is required for reimbursement of medical expenses for medical treatment for personal injuries. 7.9.2.4.  Reports  of  Survey  and  Line  of  Duty  Determinations.  Personal  injury  may accompany  the  loss  of  or  damage  to  government  property  accounted  for  within  the  Air Force Report of Survey Program. Base legal offices forward only those reports of survey and line of duty determinations that involve personal injury at regular intervals to MCRP managers to ensure that regional field offices assert all possible claims arising from these reports. (T-1) 7.9.2.5.  Property  damage  claims.  Often  incidents  causing  damage  to  government property, especially government vehicles, involve personal injury. All G claim files (see paragraph  9.1)  are  processed  by  the  base  legal  office  who  provide  notice  to  MCRP managers on potential MCR claims. (T-1) 7.9.2.6.  Injured  parties,  their  agents,  workers’  compensation  boards,  and  insurance companies.  Often,  injured  parties,  their  agents,  workers’  compensation  boards,  or insurance  companies  request  medical  records  from  Air  Force  medical  facilities.  This 56 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 request might indicate a potential claim. The applicable MTF records section, therefore, ensures  that  medical  facility  personnel  provide  copies  of  all  such  requests  to  the  MCR authority  for  review  and  possible  recovery  action.  The  request  for  records  might  also indicate  possible  medical  malpractice  against  the  U.S.  AFLOA/JACC  oversees  medical malpractice actions. 7.10.  Statute  of  Limitations.  A tort-based claim of the U.S. is subject to 28 USC 2415-2416. The  U.S.,  or  the  injured  party  on  behalf  of  the  U.S.,  must  file  suit,  based  on  tort,  within  three years after the accrual of a cause of action. Suits based in contract must be filed within six years. The MCR authority ensures that personnel apply the correct governing statute of limitations. (T-1) 28 USC 2416 provides for excluded periods when facts material to the right of action are not known and reasonably  could  not  be known by the official  charged with  responsibility to  act  in the circumstances. MCR personnel document when notices of new potential cases are received in order to determine if any period could be excluded under this authority. (T-1) Section 7B— 7.11.  Opening Claims: 7.11.1.  Open  a  claim  as  a  potential  claim  when  evidence  exists  that  the  Air  Force  has expended funds for the treatment of an injured party and a third party may be responsible for that expense. (T-1) 7.11.2.  Open a claim as an MCR claim when regional claims personnel have enough facts to assign liability for payment to a specific third party, third party payer, or third parties. (T-1) 7.12.  MCR Claims and AFCIMS.  MCR personnel use the Web Air Force Claims Information Management  System  (WebAFCIMS)  to  manage  MCR  and  potential  MCR  claims.  (T-1)  This includes cases that medical facilities, TRICARE, or other sources refer. A claim may be placed into litigation status under one of the following criteria: 7.12.1.  The  U.S.  Attorney  files  pleadings  or  agrees  to  accept  the  case.  Include  appropriate documentation in the file. 7.12.2.  When  the  plaintiff’s  attorney  signs  a  representation  agreement  and  protects  the Government’s interest by filing pleadings which include our model pleading. Place a copy of the agreement and pleadings in the file. 7.13.  Referring  MCR  Claims.  Claims  personnel  refer  MCR  claims  to  the  appropriate  MCR authority. 7.13.1.  Base legal office personnel send all potential claims information involving an injured Air  Force  member,  including  TRICARE  information  or  payments,  to  the  MCR  authority holding jurisdiction over the claim. (T-1) 7.13.2.  If  the  injured  party  or  sponsor  is  a  member  of  another  military  service  or  Federal agency, base legal office personnel send the information concerning the potential case to the appropriate  MCR  authority  to  forward  to  the  appropriate  military  service  or  agency  for action.  (T-1)    MCR  authority  personnel  coordinate  and  transfer  MCR  claims  to  the designated  military  service  in  those  areas  of  the  world  where  the  DoD  has  imposed  single-service  responsibility.  (T-1)  The  responsible  department  may  ask  a  more  conveniently located military service or agency to investigate a claim. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 57 7.13.3.  When  a  member  of  another  military  department  has  been  treated  in  an  Air  Force MTF,  the  MTF  forwards  the  initial  notification,  bill,  treatment  notes  and  all  updates  to  the responsible  SJA  office  for  that  military  department.  (T-1)  The  office  with  MCR  authority provides  the  appropriate  mailing  address  for  each  military  department  when  cases  are identified from the MTF trauma log. (T-1) 7.13.4.  In  single  service  claims  jurisdictions,  refer  potential  MCR  claims  to  the  office designated by the service with jurisdiction, regardless of the service affiliation of the injured party. (T-1) 7.14.  Investigating  and  Documenting  the  Claim.  After  identifying  a  potential  claim,  MCR personnel fully investigate accidents/incidents giving rise to claims under the FMCRA and COB. (T-1)    Review  AF  Form  1488  and/or  AF  Form  438  from  MTFs,  TRICARE  notices  of  injury reports, requests from civilian attorneys for medical records, and any other resources available to determine  if  potential  exists  to  legally  recover  the  cost  of  medical  care  furnished  to  military members,  retirees,  and  dependents.  (T-1)  The  file  should  include,  as  applicable,  information about: 7.14.1.  Facts.  (T-1)    The  facts  relating  to  the  injury  or  illness  giving  rise  to  the  claim,  to include  any  and  all  relevant  evidence  that  determines  whether  assertion  of  potential  claims are lawful and appropriate. 7.14.1.1.  MCR  authority  personnel  analyze  written  responses  from  the  injured  party through  use  of  TRICARE  DD  Form  2257,  MCRP  Questionnaire,  and  information  from his  or  her  Counsel,  locate  interested  parties  and  witnesses,  and  clarify  disputed  facts  in order  to  determine  if  facts  and  circumstances  give  rise  to  potential  third-party  liability. (T-1) 7.14.1.2.  MCR  authority  personnel  ascertain  the  nature  of  the  underlying  action, including  but  not  limited  to,  products  liability  (manufacture  or  design  defect),  motor vehicle  accident,  medical  malpractice,  slips/falls/hazards,  sport  and  recreational  injury, homeowner  liability,  business  invitee  liability,  assaults,  poisonings,  and  social  host liability. (T-1) 7.14.1.3.  MCR authority personnel obtain appropriate medical bills from both MTFs and TRICARE and determine the appropriate amount of claims, evaluate pre-existing injuries and  determine  what  medical  treatment  and  medications  are  related  to  the  accident,  and  evaluate and determine appropriate recovery paths. (T-1) 7.14.1.4.  MCR  authority  personnel  evaluate  the  facts  gathered  and  make  independent decisions  to  close  cases  where  no  potential  of  recovery  exist,  collection  costs  outweigh potential recovery, or the case is  too  weak  for litigation. (T-1) MCRP personnel  should coordinate with regional attorneys as appropriate if issues of importance exist or if there is a need for assistance to determine liability. 7.14.2.  Third  Parties.  (T-1)  MCR  authority  personnel  should  make  all  attempts  to  get  the name, address, and contact information of each third party for case files. 7.14.3.  Insurance.  (T-1)  Include  insurance  information  (to  include  the  policy  number  and address  of  the  insurance  company)  of  all  parties,  including  the  injured  party.  This  should include all types of insurance (i.e., Bodily Injury (BI) liability, Medical Payments (Med Pay), 58 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 Personal  Injury  Protection  (PIP),  Uninsured  Motorist  (UM),  Underinsured  Motorist  (UIM), Medical Malpractice, Homeowners, Renters, Workers’ Compensation), or any other form of liability  insurance  dependent  on  the  facts  or  circumstances  of  the  case.  Include  other insurance  coverage  available  or  required  in  the  regional  jurisdiction,  whether  offsetting  or stacking of uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage is permitted by law or regulation. 7.14.3.1.  In premises cases, the file includes information on medical payments insurance and liability insurance if liability exists. (T-1) 7.14.3.2.  In motor vehicle cases, MCR personnel file information  on liability  coverage, uninsured  or  underinsured  motorist  coverage,  personal  injury  protection,  and  medical payment coverage. (T-1) 7.14.3.3.  In any type of case, all major medical insurance coverage or medical payments plans available to any person potentially involved is included in the file. (T-1) 7.14.3.4.  Any  action  taken  in  accordance  with  a  state’s  financial  responsibility  laws should also be fully documented. 7.14.4.  Military Members and Civilian Employees. If the third party tortfeasor was a military member or employee, a statement indicating whether he or she was acting within the scope of employment, grossly negligent or engaged in willful misconduct at the time he or she caused the loss is included in the file. (T-1) 7.14.5.  Medical Care Costs. MCR authority personnel include all the documentary evidence supporting  the  Government’s  claim  for  medical  care  costs  in  the  claim  file.  (T-1) Reimbursement  for  the  costs  of  care  provided  by  non-Federal  facilities,  but  for  which  the U.S. has paid, should be asserted at the rates paid. This evidence includes: 7.14.5.1.  Tricare billing documents. (T-1) 7.14.5.2.  Billing documents for the costs of military care. (T-1) 7.14.5.2.1.  If MCRP regional personnel refer a claim to the Regional Attorney before care  is  completed,  ensure  that  the  current  billing  data  is  as  accurate  as  possible  and indicate whether treatment has been completed. 7.14.5.2.2.  MCR authority personnel annotate the amount of the Air Force claim so a third party or its insurer can easily identify the treatment amounts and locations. (T-1)  Readily identify the billing amounts for provided care, the actual dollar cost, or other amount that the U.S. has paid. (T-1) Calculate the Government’s claim by totaling the costs  of  all  provided  care  and  adding  the  actual  cost  of  treatment  from  non-federal sources.  (T-1)  Exclude  any  items  that  are  not  medical  care  costs  incurred  by  the Government,  such  as  subsistence  or  other  dependent  flat-rate  charges,  and hospitalization not directly related to the injury. (T-1) 7.14.5.3.  Future  Care.    When  settlement  of  a  case  is  made  before  the  injured  party completes treatment, MCR authority personnel should project the cost of future medical expenses as required by 32 C.F.R. 199.12(i)(3). 7.14.5.3.1.  Factors to be considered in determining future care cost: 7.14.5.3.1.1.  Future Surgery or Major Procedures. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 59 7.14.5.3.1.2.  Average cost of past treatment. 7.14.5.3.1.3.  Number of years of future eligibility (For example, when an injured party  becomes  Medicare  Eligible  TRICARE  for  Life  only  pays  25%  of  the  bills not paid by Medicare). 7.14.5.3.2.  When  a  case  is  settled  with  future  care  payments,  as  with  any  judicial settlement, there is no reconciliation of those future expenses. If TRICARE or MTF treatment is more or less than projected it is agreed as part of the settlement that the projections were a fair representation of future cost on the date of settlement and the case file is closed. 7.14.6.  Accrued Pay Costs. MCR authority personnel include sufficient evidence to support a  claim  under  the  FMCRA  for  accrued  pay  disbursed  to  an  injured  military  member  in  the claim file. (T-1) Personnel should work with the military member or local Military Personnel Flight and Finance Office to document and value a claim. 7.14.7.  Injuries. MCR authority personnel include all information and evidence regarding the nature and extent of any injury or disease in the claim file (T-1), such as: 7.14.7.1.  Whether the injured party has suffered a permanent or temporary disability. 7.14.7.2.  Whether the injured party has sufficiently described the disability, including the extent of injury. 7.14.7.3.  The amount of severance pay or pension the injured party has received, or will receive, from the U.S. 7.14.8.  Medical  Records.  MCR  authority  personnel  include  a  copy  of  relevant  medical records in  the  claim  file  or electronic  file when they  are to  be used to  substantiate the  care provided and the cost of that care. (T-1) 7.14.9.  Important  Information.  MCR  personnel  include  all  important  information  or evidence in the claim file such as: 7.14.9.1.  The name and address of the injured party’s attorney. (T-1) 7.14.9.2.  The status of any lawsuit or contemplated lawsuit. (T-1) 7.14.9.3.  The disposition of all related charges and traffic citations. (T-1) 7.14.9.4.  Police or other relevant investigation reports. (T-1) 7.14.9.5.  Copies  of  all  pertinent  correspondence  (i.e.  court  dockets,  pleadings,  rulings, judgments, court records), including returned receipts where applicable. (T-1) 7.15.  Asserting the Claim: 7.15.1.  MCR personnel assert a claim against a tortfeasor or other third party using a formal letter on Air Force stationery. (T-1) Make an assertion against all potential payers, including insurers. (T-1) In the demand letter, clearly state the legal basis for recovery and sufficiently describe the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident giving rise to the medical care. (T-1)      Applicable  bases  of  recovery  include  U.S.  status  as  a  third-party  beneficiary  under various  types  of  insurance  policies,  workers’  compensation  laws,  no-fault  laws,  or  other Federal statutes, including COB or FMCRA. 60 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 7.15.2.  Demand  letters  sent  via  ordinary  mail  should  be  suspensed,  and  if  a  tortfeasor  or other third party fails to respond within a reasonable period of time to any demand sent via regular  mail,  the  matter  should  be  reviewed  for  follow  up,  and  letter  re-sent  possibly  by certified  mail.  The  need  for  this  action  is  determined  by  the  amount  the  government  is seeking in reimbursement and whether it is cost effective to do so. 7.15.3.  The MCR authority promptly notifies the injured party or their legal  representative, in  writing,  that  the  U.S.  attempts  to  recover  from  a  third  party  the  reasonable  value  of medical care furnished or to be furnished. (T-1) The MCR authority may advise the injured party to seek advice from a legal assistance officer or civilian counsel. Notify injured parties of their required cooperation in the prosecution of all actions by the U.S. against third parties.  Advise them that they must give a complete statement regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding  the  incident  giving  rise  to  the  medical  care.  (T-1)  Advise  injured  parties  that they  should  not  sign  a  release  or  settle  any  claim  resulting  from  the  incident  without  first notifying  the  MCR  authority.  (T-1)  MCR  personnel  refrain  from  communicating  with  an injured  party  when  correspondence  in  the  file  indicates  the  injured  party  is  represented  by counsel. (T-1) MCRP personnel or the regional attorney contacts the injured party’s counsel when information is required from the injured party. (T-1) When counsel does not cooperate, refer the matter to the regional attorney.  (T-1) 7.16.  Attorney  Representation  Agreement.  It  is  often  advantageous  for  the  U.S.  to  have  a private attorney represent the Government’s medical care recovery interest. The U.S. Attorney is not  able  to  handle  routine  MCR  cases.  The  MCR  authority  may  request  the  injured  party’s attorney to represent the Air Force. In such a case, advise that attorney of the conditions of the requested  representation  via  sending  the  proper  attorney  representation  letter  and  attorney representation  agreement  (ARA).  (T-1)  The  injured  party’s  attorney  may  include  the Government’s claim in his or her client’s pleadings so that the U.S. need not become a party to the suit. See Attachments 4 and 5 for a sample representation letter and agreement. If an attorney is hesitant to sign an ARA or refuses to do so, contact the regional attorney and request that he or she contact the attorney in writing and/or telephonically. (T-1) If the MCR authority chooses not to  obtain  a  representation  agreement  or  no  agreement  is  procured,  the  MCR  authority independently  pursues  the  claim  through  the  responsible  insurance  company  and  notify  the insurance  company  that  the  attorney  does  not  represent  the  government’s  interest  and  has  no authority to settle the government’s claim. (T-1) 7.17.  Monitoring  the  Claim.  Diligently work to ensure settlement, payment, or closure of the file. 7.17.1.  After  asserting  a  claim,  MCR  authority  personnel  manage  claims  closely  to  ensure that  payments  are  collected  effectively  and  aggressively.  (T-1)  All  assertions  are  managed and tracked to ensure that a response is received. (T-1) In the event no response is received, further steps should be taken to communicate with the third party. (T-1) If the third party will not deal with MCR personnel, the MCR personnel coordinates with their MCR attorney for potential referral to the U.S. Attorney for litigation. (T-1) 7.17.2.  In the event an ARA has been signed, MCR personnel monitor the status of the case to ensure the matter is proceeding and the Air Force receives its just compensation. (T-1) 7.17.3.  In  the  event  a  settlement  has  been  reached,  MCR  authority  personnel  continue  to manage the case to ensure that payment is received in full. (T-1) If the settlement agreement AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 61 is  not  honored,  the  MCR  authority  should  address  the  issue  with  the  third  party  for resolution.  If resolution  is  not  obtained, the MCR authority  coordinates the issue with  their respective  MCR  authority  attorney  for  potential  referral  to  the  U.S.  Attorney  for  litigation. (T-1) Prior to referral to a U. S. Attorney, approval is obtained from Chief, MCRP. (T-1) 7.18.  Litigation.  If settlement is not possible, the regional manager within MCRP may refer the claim for litigation to their regional attorney for possible referral to the U.S. Attorney. For claims processed  by  personnel  outside  of  the  MCRP,  the  claim  should  be  referred  to  the  appropriate attorney for review, and when approved by Chief, MCRP, referral to a U.S. Attorney or DoJ. The MCR  authority  manager/attorney  provides  all  necessary  assistance  and  support  to  the  U.S. Attorney. 7.19.  Referring  a  Claim  to  the  U.  S.  Attorney. The Chief, MCRP Branch, may delegate the authority for the regional attorney to work directly with the U.S. Attorney. All cases that require forwarding to the DoJ are routed through the Chief, MCRP Branch by the regional attorney. 7.19.1.  The MCR authority ensures that personnel review all claims for possible referral not later than two years after the date of the incident for tort based cases. (T-1) 7.19.2.  The  MCR  authority,  or  the  paralegal  to  which  the  case  is  assigned,  provides  a recommendation to  their respective MCR authority attorney or regional  attorney  for review prior to a case being forwarded to the Chief, MCRP Branch (if not delegated IAW paragraph 7.18), for all unsettled cases where referral to the U.S. Attorney is recommended. (T-1) The Chief, MCRP Branch, may authorize referral of a case to the U.S. Attorney if the authority to act has not been delegated to the regional attorney. 7.19.3.  Civilian  attorneys  may  participate  in  litigating  MCR  claims,  including  filing pleadings  and  representing  the  U.S.  before  workers’  compensation  boards,  administrative tribunals and courts of law, when approved by DoJ. Air Force attorneys cannot represent the U.S.  in  a  court  of  law  without  the  express  approval  of  the  DoJ  or  the  appropriate  U.S. Attorney.  Coordinate  with  the  Chief,  MCRP  Branch,  and  obtain  the  approval  of  the appropriate U.S. Attorney prior to participation. 7.20.  Responding to Requests for Witnesses.  A MCR authority manager in coordination with their respective MCR regional attorney or legal advisor, and Medical Law Consultants (MLCs), may honor an injured party’s request for the presence of a government fact witness. Consult AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation, for further guidance regarding witness requests. 7.20.1.  AFLOA/JAC  is  the  approval  authority  for  requests  for  special  authorization  to provide  expert  or  opinion  testimony.  Once  initial  notification  is  provided,  follow-up  with  a compilation of information regarding the request. 7.20.1.1.  Treating  Providers.  Treating  providers  are  ordinarily  considered  to  be  fact witnesses,  even  though  their  testimony  may  take  on  some  aspects  of  expert  testimony. Generally, treating providers may remain fact witnesses when testifying about diagnosis, prognosis or causation. However, their testimony should be limited to their treatment of the  injured  party.  Opinions  concerning  causation,  diagnosis,  and  prognosis  are  only considered factual to the extent the opinions were formed during the course of treatment. Requests  for  opinions  not  formed  during  the  course  of  treatment  are  treated  as  requests for expert testimony. 62 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 7.20.1.2.  Forward  any  requests  for  expert  testimony  to  the  regional  attorney  for disposition. (T-1)  The regional attorney determines if the request for testimony should be coordinated through the Chief, MCRP. 7.20.2.  If an MCRP regional manager believes that an MCR case may have impact Air Force wide, he or she may request witness funding from the Chief, MCRP Branch, via the regional attorney. Upon receipt of such a request, notify the regional attorney as soon as possible, then compile and submit information about the witness request to the regional attorney. (T-1) The regional  attorney  coordinates  with  the  Chief,  MCRP  Branch  and  provide  for  witness representation if necessary (for instance at a deposition).  (T-1) 7.20.3.  MCRP personnel may be requested or subpoenaed to testify as to the accuracy of the government’s  claim.  When  requested  to  support  the  claim  of  the  U.S.,  the  MCRP  manager should prepare an affidavit of the responsible government billing official that fully explains the  amount  of  the  government  claim  and  how  the  amount  was  determined.  (T-1)  If  a subpoena  issued  by  a  judge  is  received,  work  with  the  regional  attorney  to  obtain  the appropriate authority to testify or to provide the appropriate response.  (T-1) 7.21.  Releasing  Records.  MCRP  regional  managers  review  requests  for  medical  records  or other documents relating to MCR claims. (T-1) MLCs review requests for records upon request from MCR personnel. (T-1) Reviewers consider and comply with any authority or requirements of DoD Regulation 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation; AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation;  DoD Regulation  5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302;  AFI  33-332;  and the Health Insurance Portability  and  Accountability  Act  of  1996  (HIPAA),  when  reviewing  such  requests.    (T-0) Requests for medical records not related to MCRP claims are forwarded to the appropriate MTF office. (T-1) Section 7C— 7.22.  Payment Offered in Full: 7.22.1.  Lump  Sum  Payment.  When  a  third  party  offers  to  pay  in  full,  any  MCR  personnel can accept the offer. If the third party requests a signed release, MCR personnel authorized by local office policy may sign an appropriate release. A release requiring the Government to indemnify  or  hold  harmless  is  not  acceptable.  Unique  releases  should  be  reviewed  by  the appropriate  attorney.  All  releases  should  be  limited  to  parties,  policies,  and  coverage  with whom settlement is being made. 7.22.2.  Installment  Payments.  When  a  third  party  offers  to  pay  in  full  by  installments,  the MCR authority manager may accept if payment is completed within a reasonable time. 7.22.2.1.  MCR  authority  manager  or  paralegal  assigned  the  case  prepares  a  promissory note, which details the repayment schedule, and have the tortfeasor execute it, if possible. (T-1)  When these steps have been completed, the claim may be placed into installment payment status. 7.22.2.2.  Keep the file until the third party pays the claim in full. (T-1) If the third party requests  a  signed  release,  the  regional  manager  can  sign  a  standard  release  that  is preapproved  by  their  regional  attorney  after  full  satisfaction  of  the  claim.  A  release requiring  the  Government  to  indemnify  or  hold  harmless  is  not  acceptable.  Unique releases should be reviewed by the regional attorney. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 63 7.22.2.3.  If  a  third  party  misses  an  installment  payment,  the  MCR  authority  initiates aggressive collection efforts.  (T-1) Continue trying to collect for no more than 90 days. (T-1)  Notify and coordinate with your regional attorney and the Chief, MCRP, when the third party fails to provide an acceptable response. (T-1) 7.23.  Compromise  Settlements.  A  compromise  is  a  mutually  binding  agreement  where payment is made and accepted in an amount less than the full amount of the claim. A claim may be  compromised  in  its  entirety  or  as  to  a  specific  payer,  fund,  or  policy  of  insurance.  When  a third party offers a compromise settlement, by payment of one lump sum or by installments, the settlement  authorities  have  the  authority  to  compromise  a  claim  only  if  such  action  is  for  the convenience  of  the  government  or  would  otherwise  result  in  undue  hardship  upon  the  injured party;  and  the  value  of  the  amount  due  falls  within  their  delegated  settlement  authority.  The MCR authority manager ensures that the third party makes payment within a reasonable time and that the compromise does not release any joint tortfeasor from payment. (T-1) 7.24.  Waiver.  A waiver is the voluntary relinquishment, by the U.S., of the right to collect for medical  care, future  care, or accrued pay for an injured party. Generally,  parties who receive a waiver  are  released  of  liability.  Waivers  may  be  limited  to  a  specific  third  party,  policy  or settlement.  Settlement  authorities have the authority to  waive  a claim  only  if such  action is  for the convenience of the government or would otherwise result in undue hardship upon the injured party  and  the  value  of  the  amount  due  falls  within  their  delegated  settlement  authority.  An injured  party,  its  representative,  or  a  third  party  requests  a  waiver  in  writing,  and  sufficiently state the basis for the requested waiver. 7.25.  Basis for Compromising or Waiving a Claim.  There are two bases for compromising or waiving a claim: (1) the convenience of the Government and (2) avoiding undue hardship on the injured party. 7.25.1.  Convenience  of  the  Government.  When  compromising  or  waiving  a  claim  for  the convenience of the Government consider the following factors: 7.25.1.1.  Risks of litigation. 7.25.1.2.  Questionable liability of the third party. 7.25.1.3.  Costs of litigation. 7.25.1.4.  Insurance  (Uninsured  or  Underinsured  Motorist  and  Medical  Payment Coverages) or other assets of the tortfeasor available to satisfy a judgment for the entire claim. 7.25.1.5.  Potential counterclaims against the U.S. 7.25.1.6.  Jury verdict expectancy amount. 7.25.1.7.  Amount of settlement with proposed distribution. 7.25.1.8.  Tortfeasor cannot be located. 7.25.1.9.  Tortfeasor is judgment proof. 7.25.1.10.  Tortfeasor has refused to pay and the case is too weak for litigation. 7.25.2.  Hardship on the injured party.  When compromising or waiving of a claim to avoid undue hardship on the injured party, consider the following factors: 64 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 7.25.2.1.  Permanent disability or disfigurement of the injured party. 7.25.2.2.  Decreased earning power of the injured party. 7.25.2.3.  Detailed out-of-pocket expenses to the injured party. 7.25.2.4.  Financial status of the injured party. 7.25.2.5.  Pension rights of the injured party. 7.25.2.6.  Other government benefits available to the injured party. 7.25.2.7.  Whether an offer of settlement from a third party (taking into account most or all of the third party’s assets and insurance) is considerably less than the injured party’s damages. 7.25.2.8.  Whether the injured party received excessive treatment. 7.25.2.9.  Amount  of  settlement  with  proposed  distribution,  including  reductions  in  fees or  damages  by  other  parties,  medical  providers,  or  attorneys  in  order  to  reduce  the hardship on the injured party. 7.25.3.  Allow sufficient time to process compromise or waiver requests. The amount of the government’s  claim  dictates  what  level  of  settlement  approval  is  required  for  any compromise  or  waiver.  Any  case  that  is  approved  by  the  Chief,  MCRP  Branch,  or  DoJ  is forwarded for staffing and requires several weeks for processing. 7.26.  Closing  Claims  Without  Collection.  The  U.S.,  for  its  own  convenience,  may  close  a claim  without  collection  when  it  cannot  locate  the  tortfeasor,  the  tortfeasor  cannot  pay  or  has refused to pay, collection costs outweigh potential recovery, or the case is too weak for litigation. Settlement  authorities  close  these  claims  when  they  see  fit  and  properly  document  the  file. Closing  a  claim  without  collection  does  not  prevent  its  future  assertion  against  a  third  party  if such action becomes warranted. 7.27.  Reconsideration.  A settlement authority may reconsider its previous action on a request for waiver or compromise whether requested or not. Reconsideration is normally on the basis of new  evidence  or  discovery  of  errors  in  the  waiver  submission  or  settlement,  but  can  be  based upon a re-evaluation of the claim by the settlement authority. 7.28.  Depositing Collections.  Claims personnel use DD Form 1131, Cash Collection Voucher, to deposit funds that the U.S. collects under the MCRP. (T-1) 7.28.1.  Deposit  money  recovered  for  treatment  in  an  MTF  into  the  operations  and maintenance  account  of  the  Air  Force,  Army,  Navy  or  Defense  Health  Activity  MTF  that provided the medical care. (T-0) 7.28.2.  Deposit money recovered for treatment paid by Tricare to civilian providers into the designated Tricare funding account pursuant to 10 USC 1079a. (T-0) 7.28.3.  Deposit  money  recovered  for  accrued  pay  regarding  lost  wages  into  the  operations account  of  supporting  member’s  unit  at  the  time  of  injury  or  disease  pursuant  to  42  USC 2651(f).  (T-0) 7.28.4.  All  funds  collected  are  deposited  to  the  current  fiscal  year  appropriation  in  which they are collected.  (T-0) AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 65 7.28.5.  If  there  is  no  statutory  basis  to  deposit  the  money  with  an  MTF  or  other  account, deposit money recovered with the Treasury to the Miscellaneous Receipts Account. (T-0 7.28.6.  Except  when  depositing  to  the  Miscellaneous  Receipts  Account,  provide  a  copy  of the  collection  voucher  or  other  suitable  written  notification  to  the  MTF  or  other  activity maintaining the account. (T-1) Section 7D— 7.29.  Regional Attorneys, MCRP (AFLOA/JACC). 7.29.1.  Are assigned jurisdictional areas by the Chief, MCRP, to serve as senior advisers to Regional Managers and staff in the process of settling claims on behalf of the government. 7.29.2.  Render legal opinions on personal injury tort claims to MCRP personnel, the Chief, MCRP, DoJ and the U.S. Attorneys. (T-1) 7.29.3.  Assist and serve as co-counsel, when requested, in litigation activities with the DoJ and U.S. Attorneys. (T-2) 7.29.4.  Recommend settlement of MCR claims to the Chief, MCRP, and the DoJ when the claim exceeds the delegated settlement authority. (T-1) 7.29.5.  Deny  or  negotiate  settlement  of  MCR  claims  within  the  delegated  settlement authority. (T-1) 7.29.6.  Provide tort claims and litigation training. (T-2) 66 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 CLAIMS UNDER ARTICLE 139, UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE Chapter 8 (10 USC 939) Section 8A— 8.1.  Scope.  This  chapter  explains  the  Air  Force  procedures  for  processing,  adjudicating,  and paying  claims  made  under  Article  139  of  the  UCMJ.  Article  139,  UCMJ  is  the  only administrative  means  to  force  an  Air  Force  member  to  pay  for  damage  or  loss  to  non-federal property caused by willful or wrongful acts. 8.2.  Relation  to  the  Personnel  Claims  Act  (PCA).  If  a  claim  is  made  under  Article  139, UCMJ,  but  may  also  be  cognizable  under  the  PCA,  settlement  authorities  proceed  under  this chapter.  (T-1)  If  a  claim  under  Article  139,  UCMJ is  denied,  the  claim  may  then  be  reviewed, and if appropriate, paid under the PCA. 8.3.  Effect of Disciplinary Action.  An Article 139, UCMJ claim is separate and distinct from disciplinary action that authorities may take under any other article of the UCMJ. 8.4.  Responsible Parties: 8.4.1.  Appointing  Commander.  The  commander  who  exercises  special  court-martial jurisdiction over the offender is the appointing commander.  When the offender is unknown, the  commander  exercising  special  court-martial  convening  authority  (SPCMCA)  over  the installation  where  the  complaint  or  claim  was  made  or  forwarded  is  the  appointing commander. 8.4.2.  Board  of  Officers.  A  board  of  officers  is  comprised  of  one  to  three  commissioned officers and is appointed to investigate a complaint of willful property damage or wrongful taking by Air Force personnel. A Judge Advocate may be appointed to the board. The board of  officers  is  responsible  for  investigating  the  incidents  giving  rise  to  the  claim  and recommending actions to the appointing commander consistent with this Instruction. 8.4.3.  JA Office. The SJA provides  guidance,  gives advice  and reviews the findings of the appointing commander and/or the board of officers consistent with this Instruction. Section 8B— 8.5.  Proper  Claimants  Under  Article  139,  UCMJ.  A  proper  claimant  under  Article  139, UCMJ  is  any  person  who  owns  or  has  an  interest  in  property  damaged  or  taken  by  a  military member consistent with this chapter. 8.5.1.  Persons include: civilians, military members, businesses or charities (however owned or held), and state or local governments. 8.5.2.  Federal agencies and nonappropriated fund instrumentalities are not proper claimants. 8.6.  Claims Payable.  Commanders may direct collection from individual pay to pay a claim for property  that  Air  Force  military  personnel  willfully  damage  or  wrongfully  take  as  a  result  of riotous, violent, or disorderly conduct. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 67 8.6.1.  Property.  Property  is  any  item  owned  or  possessed  by  an  individual  or  business. Property includes tangible items such as clothing, household furnishings, motor vehicles, real property, and currency. The term does not include: 8.6.1.1.  Intangible property  or items  having no independent  monetary worth.  Items that are  not  considered  as  property  for  the  purpose  of  this  chapter  include  stocks,  bonds, checks, checkbooks, credit cards, telephone services and cable television services. 8.6.1.2.  Consequential,  indirect,  or  remote  damages  such  as  loss  of  earnings,  carrying charges,  interest,  attorney’s  fees,  inconvenience  charges,  telephone  charges  and  time spent preparing a claim are also not compensable. 8.6.2.  Willful  Damage.    This  is  damage  or  destruction  that  is  caused  intentionally, knowingly, and purposely, without justifiable excuse. Willful damage involves conduct that falls into the following two categories: 8.6.2.1.  Intentional  acts  without  justification,  such  as  vandalism.  An  example  would  be an Airman who slashes the tires of another Airman’s automobile. 8.6.2.2.  Riotous,  violent,  or  disorderly  act,  acts  of  depredation,  or  conduct  showing  a reckless and wanton disregard for the property rights of others. An example would be an Airman  who  fires  a  weapon  randomly  into  the  air  causing  a  shopkeeper’s  window  to break,  or  an  Airman  who  “accidentally”  knocks  over  a  lamp  during  a  drunken  brawl.  While the Airman may not have intended to break the lamp, the involvement in a drunken brawl  was  intentional  and  constitutes  conduct  showing  a  reckless  and  wanton  disregard for the property rights of others. 8.6.3.  Wrongful Taking. “Wrongful taking” means an unauthorized taking or withholding of property  with  intent  to  deprive  the  owner  or  person  in  lawful  possession  of  said  property either  temporarily  or  permanently.  To  be  compensable  under  Article  139,  UCMJ,  any wrongful taking must be accompanied by force, violence, riotous or disorderly conduct. 8.7.  Claims Not Payable: 8.7.1.  Claims resulting from simple negligence. 8.7.2.  Claims for personal injury or death. 8.7.3.  Claims  resulting  from  acts  or  omissions  of  Air  Force  military  personnel  performing legally authorized duties within the scope of their employment. 8.7.4.  Claims of subrogees. 8.7.5.  Claims arising from private indebtedness, including, but not limited to, contract debts, collections on checks, support payments and paternity claims. 8.7.6.  Claims for reimbursement for bad checks. 8.7.7.  Claims involving wrongful taking stemming from larceny, forgery or deceit, which are not accompanied by riotous or violent action. 8.7.8.  Claims  against  Air  National  Guard  members  unless  they  are  performing  duty  under Title 10 USC. 8.7.9.  Claims for consequential damages. 68 Section 8C— AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 8.8.  Filing a Claim.  To file a claim in accordance with Article 139, UCMJ, an individual must complain to the commander of the military organization or unit of the alleged offending member or members. If claimants are unsure what organization the offender belongs to, they may file a complaint with the commander of the nearest military installation. 8.8.1.  The complaint may be oral or written. However, if oral, the claimant must reduce the complaint  to  writing  within  a  reasonable  time.  Similarly,  while  claimants  do  not  need  to request  a specific dollar  amount when they first  complain,  the claimant or authorized agent must present such a value, in writing, before a commander may make a settlement. 8.8.2.  An Article 139, UCMJ complaint must be submitted within 90 days of the date of the incident. The claimant may file after 90 days if the appointing commander finds good cause for  the  delay.  Often  the  fact  that  a  claimant  was  unaware  of  the  existence  of  Article  139, UCMJ  claims  or  the  identity  of  the  offender  is  good  cause.  A  command  determination  of good cause or absence of good cause is final. 8.9.  Action by a Commanding Officer Receiving the Complaint: 8.9.1.  If  the  commanding  officer  who  receives  the  complaint  has  SPCMCA,  and  if  the offender is a member of the command or is unknown, that commander retains the claim and acts as the appointing commander. (T-1) 8.9.2.  A  commanding  officer  without  SPCMCA  sends  the  complaint  to  the  next  higher officer in the chain of command exercising SPCMCA. (T-1) 8.9.3.  If the offender is known, but is not a member of the command, the commander sends the complaint to the offender’s immediate commanding officer. (T-1) 8.9.4.  If multiple offenders are members of different commands whose commanding officers each  have  SPCMCA,  the  receiving  commander  submits  the  complaint  to  the  SPCMCA nearest  the  place  of  the  incident.  (T-1)  That  commander  appoints  a  board  of  officers  to investigate the claim.  (T-1) 8.9.5.  If the offender is a member of another military service, the commander: 8.9.5.1.  Sends  the  complaint  to  the  offender’s  unit  commander  of  that  military  service. (T-1) 8.9.5.2.  Sends a copy of the complaint to  the legal  office serving that unit  commander. (T-1) 8.10.  Initial  Action  by  the  Appointing  Commander.  Once  it  is  determined  who  the  proper appointing  commander  is,  consistent  with  paragraph  8.10  of  this  Instruction,  the  appointing commander reviews the complaint. (T-1) 8.10.1.  If,  on  the  basis  of  the  complaint,  it  appears  that  an  Article  139,  UCMJ  claim  is cognizable, the commander appoints a board of officers to investigate the claim. (T-1) 8.10.2.  If, on the basis of the complaint, it appears that an Article 139, UCMJ claim  is  not cognizable,  the  commander  refers  the  complaint  to  the  SJA  for  legal  review.  (T-1)  If  after legal review the claim is determined not cognizable under Article 139, UCMJ, the claim may be denied without appointing a board of officers. (T-1) AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 69 8.11.  Action by the Board of Officers: 8.11.1.  The  board  notifies  the  offender,  in  writing,  of  the  pending  complaint  and  of  these rights (T-1): 8.11.1.1.  Article 31, UCMJ, rights, including the right to counsel. 8.11.1.2.  The right to examine evidence considered by the board, to include the right to be present during the examination of a witness. The board may examine witnesses prior to the identification of an offender and is  not required to re-examine a witness after the offender has been identified. 8.11.1.3.  The right to present evidence in the offender’s own behalf. 8.11.1.4.  The right to receive the commanding officer’s written decision. 8.11.2.  Each  member  of  the  board  reads  Article  139  of  the  UCMJ  and  Chapter  8  of  this Instruction. (T-1) 8.11.3.  The board of officers requests a briefing from the SJA’s office regarding Article 139, UCMJ claims, privileges, rights, the standard of review, and any other relevant issues. (T-1) The board may, at any time, seek guidance from the SJA’s office regarding their duties. 8.11.4.  The  board  of  officers  investigates  the  facts  and  circumstances  surrounding  the complaint. (T-1) 8.11.4.1.  The  board  gathers  facts  surrounding  the  event  by  visiting  the  scene  of  the incident,  interviewing  witnesses,  reviewing  physical  evidence,  and  obtaining  police reports or other relevant documents as necessary to evaluate the claim. (T-1) 8.11.4.2.  Generally,  the  board  considers  all  evidence  that  is  relevant  to  the  claim  being investigated and not privileged. (T-1) However, while the Military Rules of Evidence do not apply to Article 139, UCMJ proceedings, how evidence was obtained and its source should  be  considered  when  determining  the  reliability,  usefulness  and  veracity  of  that evidence.  For  example,  while  hearsay  statements  may  be  considered,  members  of  the board should question the reliability of such statements. 8.11.4.2.1.  The board does not consider privileged communications. (T-1) 8.11.4.2.2.  The  board  reads  witnesses  their  Article  31,  UCMJ,  rights  where appropriate. (T-1) 8.11.4.2.3.  The board should  consult  with  the SJA’s office whenever evidentiary or Article 31, UCMJ issues arise. (T-1) 8.11.5.  Standard of Proof. A determination that a member is liable under Article 139, UCMJ must  be  supported  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence.  This  means  that  the  board  must determine it is more likely than not the member is responsible for the damages claimed. This determination must be based upon the weight of the evidence. 8.11.6.  The board of officers make conclusions regarding the facts of the case. The board: 8.11.6.1.  Determines if the claim falls under Article 139, UCMJ. (T-1) 8.11.6.2.  Identifies the offenders or members present. (T-1) 8.11.6.3.  Determines culpability of each alleged offender. (T-1) 70 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 8.11.6.4.  Determines the value of claimant’s loss. (T-1) 8.11.6.5.  Determines whether the responsible party has made partial payment, and if so, how much has been paid. (T-1) 8.11.6.5.1.  If  the  offender  voluntarily  makes  payment  of  an  amount  in  full satisfaction and final settlement, the claimant may seek no further recovery. (T-1) 8.11.6.5.2.  If the offender voluntarily makes a partial payment, the board deducts that amount in computing the assessment. (T-1) 8.11.7.  The board submits a report to the appointing commander with findings based on the evidence.    (T-1)  A  description,  photograph,  or  summary  of  testimony  (or  other  reasonably accurate substitution) may be used for this report.  If liability is assessed, the report must first go through the SJA’s office for an opinion regarding legal sufficiency.  (T-1) In its report the board sets  out  the facts  as determined, attach any  relevant  evidence and recommend one of the following: 8.11.7.1.  An assessment of damages against one or more offenders. (T-1) 8.11.7.2.  An  assessment  of  appropriate  damages  against  individual  unit  members  who were present when the damage occurred, when the board cannot individually identify the offender(s). (T-1) 8.11.7.3.  A determination that the claim should be disapproved. (T-1) 8.12.  SJA  Review  of  the  Report.  When  the  board  assesses  damages  and  the  offender  is  a member of the command, the SJA reviews the report for legal sufficiency and compliance with this chapter. (T-1) The SJA determines if a preponderance of the evidence supports the findings and if the board’s recommendations are consistent with the findings. (T-1) The SJA returns the record to the board for further investigation or correction if irregularities or discrepancies exist, or sends the report to the appointing commander. (T-1) 8.13.  Final Action by the Appointing Commander.  The commander is the final authority on all Article 139 UCMJ claims. The appointing commander: 8.13.1.  Reviews  the  board  of  officers’  report  to  ensure  he  or  she  is  the  appropriate  final authority.  (T-1)  An  appointing  commander  never  takes  final  action  on  a  military  member outside of his or her command. 8.13.1.1.  If  the  alleged  offender  is  not  a  member  of  the  command,  the  appointing commander  sends  the  report  directly  to  the  offender’s  commanding  officer  exercising SPCMCA for final action. (T-1) This may occur when an offender is unknown when the board is appointed, but is discovered during the investigation or when there are multiple offenders from different commands. 8.13.1.2.  If  the  alleged  offender  is  a  member  of  a  different  service,  the  appointing commander  sends  the  report  directly  to  the  commander  of  the  member’s  unit  of  the service concerned. (T-1) 8.13.2.  Ensures the board of officers’ report is  complete. (T-1) The appointing commander may return the record to the board or SJA for further investigation or correction if incomplete or if there are irregularities or discrepancies. If the record is returned to the board for further AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 71 investigation  or  correction,  the  board  forwards  the  revised  record  to  the  SJA  to  review  the report for legal sufficiency and compliance with this chapter. 8.13.3.  Makes independent determinations based upon the board of officers’ report. (T-1) 8.13.3.1.  Determines if the claim falls under Article 139, UCMJ. (T-1) 8.13.3.2.  Determines  culpability  of  an  individual,  individuals,  or  unit  members  present during the relevant event if the specific offender cannot be identified. (T-1) 8.13.3.3.  Sets  the  amount  to  be  assessed  against  each  offender  or  unit  member.  This amount may be less than what the board recommends, but may not exceed that amount. (T-1) 8.13.3.3.1.  In  the  event  the  amount  to  be  assessed  against  any  one  person  exceeds $5,000 for a single incident, a copy of the file is sent to AFLOA/JACC for approval. (T-1) The file includes a copy of the board of officers’ report and the memorialized decision of the appointing commander. (T-1) The file is sent to AFLOA/JACC prior to the commander directing payment or notifying the offender(s). (T-1) 8.13.4.  Memorializes his or her determinations in writing.  (T-1) 8.13.5.  Directs the accounting and finance officer to withhold the assessed amount from the pay  of  each  offender,  and  to  pay  the  claimant.  (T-0)  The  accounting  and  finance  officer having custody of the offender’s pay record pays the claim. (T-1)  This should only be done after a review by AFLOA/JACC if more than $5,000 is assessed against an offender. 8.13.6.  Notifies in writing the claimant and the offender of the action taken. (T-1) 8.13.7.  Commanders  may  receive  a  report  from  a  board  convened  by  another  Air  Force commander  or  commander  of  another  service.  The  commander  may  act  upon  that  report without convening his/her own board, if the report is sufficient to satisfy the commander that assessment  against  a  member  of  his  or  her  command  is  consistent  with  Air  Force  policy regarding Article 139, UCMJ. Prior to action on the report, the commander obtains a review by his/her SJA for legal sufficiency. (T-1) 8.14.  Appeals.  Neither  the  claimant  nor  the  offender  has  a  right  to  appeal  a  decision  of  the appointing commander. 8.15.  Reconsidering Article 139, UCMJ Assessments: 8.15.1.  The  commanding  officer  originally  ordering  the  assessment  may  reconsider  and change a decision if the findings later prove to be wrong either in law or fact. 8.15.2.  A successor in command may change or cancel the assessment only on the basis of: 8.15.2.1.  Newly discovered evidence. 8.15.2.2.  Fraud. 8.15.2.3.  Obvious mistake of fact or law. 8.15.3.  Only the original appointing commander or his or her successor may take the actions stated above.  This is true even if the offender is transferred to a different command. 72 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 8.16.  Canceling  Indebtedness.  Authorities  may  cancel  indebtedness  assessed  under  Article 139, UCMJ, only in accordance with this chapter. Other statutes authorizing the Secretary of the Air Force to cancel indebtedness of a member do not apply to Article 139, UCMJ. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 73 Chapter 9 PROPERTY DAMAGE TORT CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE U.S. Section 9A— 9.1.  Scope.  This  chapter  describes  the  principles  and  procedures  by  which  the  U.S.  Air  Force asserts  and  collects  claims  for  damage  to  its  property  due  to  a  third  party’s  negligence  or wrongful act.  These claims  are  generally  referred to  as “pro-Government” or “G”  claims. As a property owner, the Air Force is often the victim of a tort and has the right and obligation under the FCCA (31 USC 3711-3720E) to collect for tortious damage or loss to its property.  Air Force policy is to aggressively pursue all such claims for loss or damage. 9.2.  Government  Claims  Program  Required.  Each supervisory claims authority ensures that its personnel promptly discover all potential claims under this chapter and fully investigate and vigorously pursue them.  This can only occur if an appropriate government claims program is in place.  This program: 9.2.1.  Ensures  a  system  exists  whereby  all  potential  claims  can  be  identified  and  promptly reported. 9.2.2.  Educates  local  personnel  such  that  they  are  aware  of  the  program,  understand  their reporting responsibilities, and can identify potential tortfeasors. 9.2.3.  Ensures  the  legal  office  with  claims  jurisdiction  over  the  incident  area  properly  and aggressively  assert,  monitor  and  settle  claims  consistent  with  this  chapter,  the  FCCA,  and other pertinent Federal Regulations. 9.3.  Assertable  Claims.  Generally, base legal personnel may assert claims against a tortfeasor or other responsible party (such as an insurance company) for loss of or damage to government property,  including  NAF  property,  if  the  loss  or  damage  is  for  $100  or  more.  If  the  loss  or damage is less than $100, assert the claim only if it is practicable and economical to do so. (T-1) 9.4.  Settlement Authority: 9.4.1.  TJAG;  DJAG;  AFLOA/JAC;  and  AFLOA/JACC  may  assert,  waive  or  compromise claims in an amount not to exceed $100,000 (see Table A1.2) 9.4.2.  SJAs responsible for claims may (see Table A1.2): 9.4.2.1.  Assert claims in any amount; 9.4.2.2.  Waive or compromise claims up to $25,000. 9.4.3.  Redelegating  Authority.  Settlement  authorities  may  redelegate  their  full  authority,  in writing, to a subordinate judge advocate, or civilian attorney. 9.5.  Special Situations: 9.5.1.  Contractors.  Contact  the  local  contracting  officer  first.  Only  assert  a  claim  against  a contractor  under  this  chapter  if  the  contracting  officer  does  not  intend  to  assert  the  claim under  the  contract.  Document  for  the  file  the  contracting  officer’s  decision  not  to  assert  a claim. (T-1) If a dispute arises between the legal  office and the contracting office as to: (1) whether a cause of action exists under tort law, or (2) whether the claim should be pursued 74 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 through  procurement  or  claims  channels,  document  the  disagreement  and  send  a  full  and complete copy of the claim to AFLOA/JACC. (T-1) 9.5.2.  Medical  Cost  Reimbursement.  If  the  “G”  claim  arises  from  the  same  incident  as  a medical cost reimbursement claim, the base legal office asserts claims for the property loss or damage and notify the regional MCRP office who in turn asserts the claim for medical costs. (T-1)  Information  each  office  discovers  during  the  investigation  process  is  shared  with  the other office. 9.5.3.  Anti-Government Torts. If a tortfeasor, or his/her insurer, presents a claim against the Government  arising  from  the  same  incident  that  serves  as  the  basis  of  a  pro-Government claim asserted under this chapter, process both the pro-Government and anti-Government tort claim  together.  (T-1)  Do  not  settle  either  claim  separately  without  coordination  with AFLOA/JACC. 9.5.4.  Foreign Torts Abroad. In cases where single service claims responsibility exists, only the  service  assigned  claims  responsibility  for  the  geographic  area  where  the  incident  arose asserts  government  claims.  (T-0)  Consult  DoD  Instruction  5515.08  prior  to  asserting  such claims  to  determine  the  responsible  service.  In  the  event  a  tortfeasor,  or  his/her  insurer, presents  a  foreign  or  international  claim  against  the  Government  arising  from  the  same incident that serves as the basis of a pro-Government claim, process the pro-Government tort claim as a counterclaim. 9.5.5.  Product  Liability.  Due  to  the  unique  nature  of  product  liability  issues  and  claims litigation, obtain AFLOA/JACC approval before asserting a claim using a products liability theory of recovery. (T-1) 9.6.  Nonassertable Claims.  Base legal personnel do not assert a claim for loss of or damage to government property in these instances: 9.6.1.  Claims  Liability  Reimbursement.  Do  not  assert  a  claim  for  reimbursement  against military or civilian employees for claims paid by the U.S. due to that employee’s negligence. 9.6.2.  Nonappropriated  Fund  Employees.  Do  not  assert  claims  for  loss  or  damage  that  a nonappropriated fund employee causes to government property while on the job. 9.6.3.  Military  Members  and  Employees  and  the  Report  of  Survey  Program  (ROS).  Generally, procedures for seeking compensation for loss or damage to government property caused  by  Air  Force  employees  and  military  members  is  governed  by  the  ROS  program (AFMAN 23-220, Reports of Survey for Air Force Property). However, consistent with the ROS  program,  damage  to  government  property  caused  by  a  private  conveyance  may  be properly asserted under this  chapter. Regardless,  never assert a claim  for  loss or damage to government  property  if  an  ROS  has  been  processed  against  the  same  person  for  damage  to the same property arising from the same incident or loss. 9.6.4.  Maritime  Claims.  Do  not  assert  maritime  claims  in  favor  of  the  U.S.  under  this chapter. Refer pro-Government maritime claims to AFLOA/JACC. 9.6.5.  Medical Cost Reimbursement Claims. Do not assert MCR claims under this chapter. 9.6.6.  Foreign Governments. Do not assert a claim for monies to be recovered from a foreign government or any of its political subdivisions. AFLOA/JACC may authorize exceptions to AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 75 this rule. If a foreign country voluntarily offers to pay a claim, or offers to repair or replace lost or damaged property, the SJA notifies AFLOA/JACC. (T-1) 9.6.7.  Federal Agencies. Do not assert a claim against another Federal agency. 9.7.  Statute  of  Limitations.  The  U.S.  must  file  a  lawsuit  for  loss  or  damage  to  government property based in tort within three years after accrual. Periods during which a responsible official of the U.S. did not know or reasonably should not have known the material facts that resulted in the  claimed  loss  are  excluded  when  calculating  the  three  years.  Some  other  periods  are  also excludable (see 28 USC 2415-2416). Suits based in contract or upon some other theory or upon state  law  may  have  a  different  statute  of  limitations  period.  The  SJA  ensures  the  correct governing  statute  is  applied.    (T-1)  Base  legal  personnel  must  never  allow  expiration  of  the statute of limitations to prevent collecting on a claim. (T-1) Section 9B— 9.8.  Processing  Claims  Generally.  All claims offices ensure claims are properly investigated, vigorously asserted, and closely monitored to aggressively protect Air Force interests.  (T-0) 9.9.  Reporting Potential Claims.  Personnel report all incidents involving damages to or loss of government  property  that  may  result  in  liability  of  a  third  party  in  excess  of  $10,000  to AFLOA/JACC by facsimile or electronic mail. (T-1) 9.10.  Investigating the Claim.  Base legal personnel conduct timely, thorough investigations of all  claims  and  potential  claims.  (T-1)  These  investigations  must  thoroughly  research  and document both the facts and law necessary to support a cause of action against the tortfeasor. (T-1) Thoroughly document: 9.10.1.  The  factual  and  legal  basis  for  the  tortfeasor’s  negligence.  (T-1)    Include  in  the claims file, when applicable, witness statements, copies of other investigations, information regarding  any  violations  of  law  or  regulation  (including  charges  or  citations  relating  to criminal or traffic violations), and a summary of any applicable law. 9.10.2.  Air Force damages. (T-1) 9.10.2.1.  Include  in  the  file  evidence  of  loss  or  actual  damage  and  costs  of  repair (including  materials  and  overhead)  or  replacement  of  government  property.  (T-1)  If  the cost  of  labor  and  overhead  is  based  on  a  government  regulation,  directive,  or  technical order, include the appropriate portions of that document in the file. (T-1) 9.10.2.2.  Include in the file evidence of consequential damages (loss of use, removal to storage,  and storage  costs), if  any. (T-1) Support  with  evidence the  calculation  of those damages, and include this information in the file. (T-1) 9.10.3.  Include in the file all necessary information pertaining to the tortfeasor. (T-1)  This includes  items  such  as  proof  of  service  of  the  demand,  correspondence  with  the  tortfeasor, and insurance information and reports on the tortfeasor’s financial status. (T-1) 9.11.  Asserting  the  Claim.  After  investigating  the  incident  giving  rise  to  a  property  damage claim, researching relevant law and identifying the appropriate tortfeasors, the base SJA asserts the  claim.  (T-1)  This  is  done  by  sending  via  certified  mail,  return  receipt  requested,  a  formal 76 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 letter to the tortfeasors on Air Force letterhead. (T-1) The letter provides sufficient notification of the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident, including: 9.11.1.  A reference to the statutory right of the U.S. under the FCCA to collect for the loss or damage. (T-1) 9.11.2.  A  demand  for  payment  for  loss  or  damage  to  the  property  or  a  demand  for  the restoration of that property. (T-1) 9.11.3.  A description of the loss or damage. (T-1) 9.11.4.  A description of the tortfeasor’s action or forbearance which led to  the government loss. (T-1) 9.11.5.  The date and place of the incident giving rise to the claim. (T-1) 9.11.6.  The name, office address, and telephone number of the base legal office personnel to contact regarding the claim. (T-1) 9.12.  Monitoring  the  Claim.  After  base  legal  personnel  assert  the  claim,  the  SJA  ensures personnel  monitor  the  claim  and  aggressively  follow  up.  (T-1)  All  contact  by  the  tortfeasor  or tortfeasor’s  counsel  should  receive  a  prompt  response.  If  the  tortfeasor  fails  to  respond  to  the initial assertion letter, at least two subsequent demand letters should be sent at 30-day intervals. (T-1) 9.12.1.  If the tortfeasor fails to respond to the assertion letters or makes a final decision not to pay, the SJA forwards the case to AFLOA/JACC.  (T-1) AFLOA/JACC determines if the case is referred to the U.S. Attorney.   (T-1) 9.12.2.  If  base legal  personnel  do  not  receive  payment  (notwithstanding  ongoing negotiations or a signed settlement agreement) within 18 months from the incident date, or if there is indication of fraud or misrepresentation by the tortfeasor, the SJA forwards the file to AFLOA/JACC.  (T-1) Section 9C— 9.13.  Disposition  of  Claims,  Generally.  After  a  claim  has  been  asserted  it  must  be  settled, referred for litigation, or closed without collection.  (T-1) 9.14.  Settling  Claims  in  Full.  When  a  third  party  offers  full  payment,  accept  the  offer.  (T-1)   Settlement  authorities  may  sign  an  appropriate  release,  if  requested.    However,  a  release requiring the Government to indemnify or hold harmless any settling party is not acceptable. 9.14.1.  The  settlement  authority  may  accept  a  third  party’s  offer  to  repair  or  replace  the damaged  property  as  payment  in  full.    The  third  party  must  agree  to  repair  or  replace  the property to the satisfaction of the accountable property officer. (T-1) 9.14.2.  Base  legal  personnel  should  strive  to  arrange  repair  or  replacement,  as  this  makes property useable for the mission without the expenditure of operational funds. 9.15.  Compromise  Settlements.  When  a  third  party  offers  an  acceptable  compromise  on  a claim  within  the  base’s  settlement  authority,  accept  the  offer  and  sign  a  release,  if  requested.  However, a release requiring the Government to indemnify or hold harmless any settling party is not acceptable. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 77 9.15.1.  In order to maximize collections for the U.S.,  settlement  authorities may  agree to  a compromise settlement within their authority when: 9.15.1.1.  The  tortfeasor  is  unable  to  pay  the  full  amount  within  a  reasonable  time.  Obtain  a  sworn  statement  showing  the  debtor’s  assets  and  liabilities,  income,  expenses, and insurance coverage, and include it in the claim file. 9.15.1.2.  The  Government  is  unable  to  collect  a  claim  in  full  within  a  reasonable  time, even though it has used enforced collection proceedings. 9.15.1.3.  The cost to collect does not justify enforced collection in the full amount. 9.15.1.4.  The  Government  might  have  difficulty  proving  its  case  in  court  for  the  full amount claimed, if a question exists about the tortfeasor’s liability or a problem arises in proving the amount and extent of damages to the U.S. 9.15.2.  If a claims office decides not to pursue a claim for any reason (including those listed above),  the  claims  office  completes  a  detailed  memorandum  for  record  documenting  the reason and place it in the file. (T-1) 9.15.3.  Prejudgment Interest.  A settlement authority may waive prejudgment interest (where statute, contract, or regulation do not require it) to encourage payment.  Inform the tortfeasor that the U.S. seeks such interest in the event of litigation. (T-1) 9.15.4.  Settlement  authorities  may  not  compromise  in  cases  of  fraud,  misrepresentation,  or violation of antitrust laws.  The DoJ must authorize compromise of such claims. (T-1) 9.15.5.  When two or more tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable, settlement authorities may  divide  the  payment  between  them.    Take  care  that  a  compromise  with  one  tortfeasor does  not  release  the  claims  against  the  remaining  responsible  parties.  Prior  to  release  of  a party for partial payment, settlement authorities should consider whether the remaining loss can  be  collected  from  the  remaining  tortfeasors  and  hence  whether  release  of  one  or  more parties is in the best interests of the Air Force. 9.16.  Installment  Payment  Settlements.  When  a  third  party  offers  to  pay  the  claim  in installments (either in the full amount or an acceptable compromise) and the claim is within the base  settlement  authority,  the  SJA  may  accept  the  debt  if  the  third  party  can  repay  it  within  a reasonable time and the compromise does not release any joint tortfeasor. 9.16.1.  Prepare  a  confession  of  judgment  (cognovit)  note,  which  details  the  repayment schedule,  and  have  the  tortfeasor  execute  it.  (T-1)  Carefully  follow  the  claim  to  ensure  the third party makes payment according to the schedule. 9.16.2.  Base  legal  personnel  keep  the  file  until  the  third  party  has  made  full  payment according  to  the  terms.    (T-1)  If  the  third  party  is  delinquent  in  making  an  installment payment,  write  a  demand  letter  reminding  the  third  party  of  the  obligation  to  pay.  (T-1) Continue collection efforts  for no more than 90 days after the account  becomes delinquent. After  90  days  forward  the  file  to  AFLOA/JACC.    (T-1)  AFLOA/JACC  determines  if  the matter is referred to the appropriate U.S. Attorney’s Office.   (T-1) 9.17.  Referring  a  Claim  to  the  U.  S.  Attorney  for  Litigation.  If  collection  efforts  are unsuccessful, AFLOA/JACC may refer a claim to the appropriate U.S. Attorney’s Office or the DoJ for initiation of a lawsuit. 78 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 9.17.1.  If requested by AFLOA/JACC, base legal personnel submit a detailed, written report to AFLOA/JACC. (T-1) 9.17.2.  After  referring  the  claim  to  the  U.S.  Attorney,  AFLOA/JACC  periodically  queries the U.S. Attorney’s Office to determine the status of the claim if AFLOA/JACC receives no report. 9.18.  Potential  Offset  Action.  The  U.S.  has  the  same  right  as  any  other  creditor  to  apply money of the debtor toward paying off a debt. The U.S. may administratively offset a liquidated tort  claim  against  an  amount  that  it  owes  to  the  claimant.  When  a  party  refuses  to  pay voluntarily,  settlement  authorities  look  to  implement  offset  action  to  collect  claims,  if  a settlement  agreement  has  been  signed,  a  judgment  exists  or  the  claim  has  been  otherwise liquidated. 9.19.  Terminating Efforts Without Collection: 9.19.1.  The SJA may terminate all collection efforts, within their settlement authority, when: 9.19.1.1.  The  Government  is  unable  to  collect  the  debt  after  exhausting  all  reasonable collection methods. 9.19.1.2.  Base legal personnel cannot locate the tortfeasor after exhausting all reasonable efforts. 9.19.1.3.  The cost to collect exceeds recovery. 9.19.1.4.  The claim is legally without merit. 9.19.1.5.  The evidence does not adequately prove the claim. 9.19.2.  The SJA may suspend collection action when authorities cannot locate the tortfeasor or the tortfeasor is unable to pay, but future collection may be possible. 9.20.  Depositing  Collections.  Claims  personnel  deposit  collections  as  follows  (see  31  USC 3302, 10 USC 2831 and 10 USC 2782) (T-0): 9.20.1.  Deposit  collections  for  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  to  Air  Force  family  housing, caused by  abuse or negligence, to  the DoD Military  Family  Housing Management Account 57*0745.  (Insert  the  last  digit  of  the  current  fiscal  year  for  the  *).    Damages  to  privatized housing  are  generally  not  asserted  as  a  G-claim.    Legal  personnel  review  the  applicable privatized housing agreement(s) before asserting a G-claim for damages to such property. 9.20.2.  Deposit  collections  for  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  to  other  real  property  to  the appropriate  funds  account  of  the  organization  responsible  for  the  repair,  maintenance,  or replacement  of  the  real  property.  Only  reuse  these  funds  if  authorized  by  law  (see  10  USC 2782). Historically, Congress does not provide such authorization and these funds may not be used locally. 9.20.3.  Deposit  collections  for  loss,  damage,  or  destruction  to  property  under  control  of  an Air Force Industrial Fund (AFIF) or other revolving fund to the appropriate fund account (10 U.S.C. 2208(c), 65 Comp Gen 910). 9.20.4.  Collections  involving  NAFI  property  are  sent  to  the  appropriate  NAFI  noted  in paragraph 6.5 of this Instruction. AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 79 9.20.5.  Unless specific statutory authority exists to do otherwise, deposit all other collections to the U.S. Treasury Miscellaneous Receipts Account 57 3210.999.  CHRISTOPHER F.

Legally  Responsible.—A  term  of  art  providing  for  settlement  of  claims  under  cost  sharing international  agreements  in  accordance  with  the  law  of  the  receiving  State.  Often,  employees who are local inhabitants, not part of the civilian component of the force, could cause the sending State to be legally responsible under a respondeat superior theory. Maritime  Tort.—A  tort  committed  in  navigable  waters  or  on  land  or  in  the  air  where  a substantial  element  of  the  damage,  personal  injury,  or  death  occurred  in  or  over  navigable waters.

It is often thought of as the “host nation.” Reconsideration Authority—. Under claims statutes which do not grant the right of appeal, the individual  (determined  by  job  title)  who  makes  the  final  determination  regarding  a  claim  for which reconsideration has been requested. Recreational  Purpose.—The  use  of  recreational  facilities  for  the  enjoyment  of  people, including,  but  not  limited  to,  activities  such  as  fishing,  hunting,  camping,  ball  playing,  golf, water  sports,  beach  activities,  hiking,  animal  riding,  off-road  vehicle  riding,  bicycling,  skating, skate-boarding,  picnicking,  sledding,  skiing,  and  visiting  or  photographing  historical, archeological, scenic, natural, and scientific sites.

Settle.—To  consider,  ascertain,  adjust,  determine,  and  dispose  of  a  claim,  whether  by  full  or partial allowance or by disallowance. Settlement  Authority.—The  individual  or  Foreign  Claims  Commission  (for  claims  under  the FCA)  who  has  the  authority  under  this  instruction  to  pay  or  deny  a  claim.

Third parties are parties other than  members  of  the  force  and  civilian  component  of  the  sending  or  receiving  States. Dependents,  tourists,  and  other  noninhabitants  of  a  foreign  country  are  third  parties  (and 88 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 therefore  can  generally  make  a  claim  under  a  SOFA)  unless  the  international  agreement,  or  an understanding between the countries involved, specifically excludes them.  AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 89 Attachment 2 ADDRESSES AFLOA/JACE 1500 West Perimeter Road, Suite 1500 Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762 AFLOA/JACC 1500 West Perimeter Road, Suite 1700 Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762 Judgment Fund Group  Department of the Treasury Financial Management Service Prince George’s Metro Center 2 3700 East West Highway, Rm. 6F03 Hyattsville, MD 20782    Attachment 3 CLAIMS AUTHORITIES TABLE  FTCA MCA FCA NGCA Admiralty (Against US) Admiralty (For US) Any amount 10 USC 2733(d) Any amount 10 USC 2734(d) Any amount 32 USC 715(d) Any amount1 10 USC 9802(b) $500,0002 10 USC 9803(a) SECAF Source TJAG Source DJAG Source JAC Source JACC Source $300,000 -

As you may know, the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA) (42 U.S.C. Sections 2651-2653) and Coordination of Benefits Statute (COB) (10 U.S.C. 1095) establishes the right of the United States to recover the reasonable value of medical care furnished or to be furnished by government facilities or through CHAMPUS/Tri-Care from any third-party liable for the underlying injury or illness.  Although the United States can proceed separately and directly against a third party tortfeasor, it is usually mutually beneficial for the United States to assert its claim through the injured party’s attorney.  This procedure permits you to retain more control over both settlement negotiations and litigation (except that you may not settle the claim of the United States for less than the full amount demanded without this office’s approval).  Also, the Air Force will cooperate with you in obtaining essential Government medical records and other reasonably available material at no cost to you or your client.  However, 5 U.S.C. 3106 prohibits any payment to you for representing the United States.   Claims of the United States under the FMCRA are subject to the three-year statute of limitations contained in 28 U.S.C. 2415.  The following “model allegation” will sufficiently protect such claims:    “As a result of said injuries, the plaintiff has received (and in the future will continue to receive) medical and hospital care and treatment furnished by the United States of America.  The plaintiff, for the sole use and benefit of the United States of America under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 2651-2653, and with its express consent, asserts a claim for the reasonable value of said (past and future) care and treatment.”   AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 99 In those cases where this allegation is not included in the pleadings, the file will be referred by this office to the local United States Attorney for intervention and the initiation of a separate suit.  This may result in a loss of some of the benefits as indicated above.  The current amount of the United States’ claim is $______.  When and if the case is settled please forward the government’s lien made payable to USAF-Claims to:      AFLOA/MCRP, Region 2     33 Sweeney Blvd     Langley AFB VA  23665-2198  Should you believe the facts warrant a waiver or compromise of the government’s claim, please contact ____________ at (757) 225-5886 for guidance.  We would appreciate your assistance in providing the following information pertaining to the defendant in this case: Name, Address, Phone Number, Insurance Company, Name of Insured, Policy Number and Type of Coverage.  We would further ask that if circumstances necessitate a Motion of Judgment be filed in this matter, a copy of the motion be forwarded to this office.  Therefore, we request, on the terms and conditions stated above, you agree to assert the claim of the United States.  If this arrangement is acceptable to you and your client, please acknowledge this at your earliest convenience.                   Sincerely            NAME, RANK, DAFC        Regional Claims Manager  Attachment:  100 AFI51-501  13 SEPTEMBER 2016 (SAMPLE REPRESENTATION AGREEMENT) Attachment 7 Injured Party/Parties: Name  Debtor:   Date of Incident:   Place of Incident: North Carolina  It is understood that under the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act (FMCRA) (42 U.S.C. Sections 2651-2653) and Coordination of Benefits Statute (COB) (10 U.S.C. 1095) and judicial decisions, the United States of America has the right to recover the reasonable value of care and treatment furnished or to be furnished by for the United States to persons entitled to such care and treatment when such persons suffer injury or disease under circumstances which create liability for payment on some third party.  In the case of the above-named injured party or parties, the undersigned attorney, acting for the firm named below, agrees to protect the interest of the United States in its claim for such care and treatment in return for the United States refraining from entering into separate negotiations with third parties or insurers. The United States will provide the attorney with evidence of such care and treatment and the reasonable value of the medical expenses. In that regard, the model allegation may be incorporated into any pleadings in this case.  IN ORDER TO ARRANGE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF SUCH EVIDENCE, THE UNDERSIGNED ATTORNEY AGREES TO REQUEST THE SAME NO LESS THAN TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE DATE OF TRIAL.
