This memorandum implements CIP (previously known as the Career Intermission Pilot Program or CIPP; also known as the Career Flexibility Program) and provides the policies and procedures to allow a  one-time temporary transition from active duty to the Individual Ready Reserve and a seamless return to active duty.    This pilot program applies to all  RegAF Airmen and career status Active Guard and Reserve Airmen.

DANIEL R. SITTERLY Acting Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Manpower & Reserve Affairs)           Attachment 1 CAREER INTERMISSION PROGRAM (CIP) GUIDANCE This Guidance Memorandum directs the collection of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974.  The authority to collect and maintain the prescribed records in this Guidance Memorandum are Title 10, United States Code (USC), Section (§) 8013, and the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF).  The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a tier  (“T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3”) number following the compliance statement. See AFI 33-360, Publications  and Forms Management, Table 1.1 for a description of the authorities associated with the tier  numbers. Submit requests for waivers through the chain of command to the appropriate tier waiver  approval authority, or alternately, to the publication OPR for non-tiered compliance items. Ensure that all records created as a result of processes prescribed in this publication are  maintained IAW Air Force Manual (AFMAN) 33-363, Management of Records, and  disposed of IAW Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS) Records Disposition Schedule (RDS). Requirements for this program may change based on needs identified by DCS, Manpower, Personnel, and Services (AF/A1) and the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) in coordination with AF/RE and NGB/CF. 1.  Purpose.    CIP provides a one-time, temporary transition from active duty to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) for officer and enlisted Airmen to meet personal or professional needs outside the service while providing a mechanism for seamless return to active duty.  The long-term intent of the program is to retain the valuable experience and training investment in our Airmen that might otherwise be lost by permanent separation.  It provides an avenue to meet the changing needs of today’s service members.   This work-life flexibility initiative will enable the USAF to retain talent, which reduces cost and adverse impacts on the mission.   2.  Background.    The FY09 NDAA, Section 533 of Public Law 110-417, authorized the Armed Forces in the Department of Defense (DoD) to establish a pilot program under which officer and enlisted Airmen may be inactivated from active duty with a corresponding appointment or enlistment in the IRR for a period up to three years, with return to active duty at the end of the inactive period.  FY12 NDAA, Section 531 of Public Law 112-81, extended CIP authority through 31 Dec 2015; FY13 NDAA, Section 522 of Public Law 112-239, expanded eligibility to certain active Guard and Reserve members; FY15 NDAA, Section 522 of Public Law 113-291, extended CIP authority through 31 Dec 2019; FY16 NDAA, Section 523 of Public Law 114-92, expanded eligibility to members in their initial service agreement period and members in receipt of a critical skills retention  bonus, and removed the limitation on the number of program participants per year.   All CIP Airmen  must return to active duty no later than 31 Dec 2022 or within 3 years from entry into CIP,  whichever comes first. 2                    3. Program Scope.
