All  Parachutists’  mask  stored  in  serviceable  storage  status  will  be  inspected annually. (T-1) 2.5.2.9.  Commercial Aircrew Oxygen Masks for Operational Support Aircraft/Executive Airlift (OSA/EA) and Large Frame Aircraft (LFA).  Lead Command—AMC. 2.5.2.9.1.  OSA/EA  and  certain  LFA  have  a  variety  of  commercial  variant  aircrew oxygen  masks  that  would  be  considered  atypical  compared  to  the  rest  of  the  USAF aircraft inventory.  These masks may be managed and/or maintained under contract as contracted work.  The AFEO/AFES will be aware of and ensure compliance with any contract related to the unit’s AFE mission.  The AFEO/AFES will attempt to resolve local  contract  issues  at  the  unit-level;  notify  the  MAJCOM  FM/Staff  and  request assistance if the matter cannot be resolved locally.  (T-1) 2.5.2.9.2.  Unless  specifically  covered  by  contract  and/or  identified  as  contracted work, AFE will use the following guidance to inspect and maintain these masks (T-2): 2.5.2.9.2.1.  Use  commercial  manuals  to  inspect  and  maintain  these  masks  when standard USAF technical orders do not exist.  (T-2) 2.5.2.9.2.2.  AFE  responsible  for  OSA/EA  or  LFA  with  commercial  variant 16 AFI11-301V2  20 DECEMBER 2013 oxygen  masks  will  establish  30-day  inspection  requirements  (using  general procedures  consistent  with  overall  maintenance  procedures  in  commercial manuals) for all aircraft installed aircrew oxygen masks.  (T-2) 2.5.2.9.2.3.  The  30-day  inspection  requirement  includes  oxygen  masks  used  by aircrew  to  include  mask  types  such  as  the  Scott  (Avox)  359  Series,  the  EROS Mask  Series,  KC-10A  Avox  358-1390V  Series  and  the  firefighter  smoke  mask (e.g. Scott/Avox P/N 10100 or 10800 series).  (T-1) 2.5.2.9.2.4.  AFE’s scope of the 30-day inspection may be limited to  the general condition of the mask, cleaning, and oxygen to mask operational check.  In some cases,  AFE  may  not  be  able  to  do  a  communications  check  as  part  of  the inspection. 2.5.2.9.2.5.  AFE  will  track  the  30-day  inspection  of  oxygen  masks  using  the standard AFE shop data and tracking system currently used for other items AFE maintains.    Additionally,  if  AFE  is  required  to  include  AFTO  Form  46, Prepositioned  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment,  with  the  aircraft  forms  or  on  the aircraft, the next 30-day inspection due date will be annotated on the AFTO Form 46.  (T-2) 2.5.2.9.2.6.  Tracking  30-day  inspection  due  dates  by  a  Maintenance  Function(s) is  at  the  option  of  the  unit  and  if  deemed  necessary  should  be  done  via  mutual written  agreement  between  the  Maintenance  Function(s)  and  the  AFE  function.  In most cases, inclusion of the AFTO Form 46 on the aircraft or with the aircraft forms will suffice. 2.5.2.9.2.7.  Given  the  wide  range  of  locations  OSA/EA  aircraft  operate,  AFE support is often not available or the AFE personnel at those locations may not be qualified  to  work  on  OSA/EA  aircraft.    AFE  and  Maintenance  will  refer  to  TO 00-20-1,  which  has  specific  exceptions  for  when  flight  equipment  becomes overdue  when  an  aircraft  is  off  station,  on  alert,  etc.    Note:  Units  will  not  use these exceptions as a deliberate planning factor prior to a mission.  (T-2) 2.6.  Aircrew Oxygen Connectors.  Lead Command—ACC. 2.6.1.  General Aircrew Oxygen Connector Guidance. 2.6.1.1.

JHMCS Compatible ALEP Spectacles (JCAS). 2.10.3.3.1.  The JCAS design is a rapid response effort to provide laser protection for JHMCS  users.  The  required  laser  protection  is  contained  within  a  laminated polycarbonate lens structure. The JCAS lenses are housed in the Low Pro Wrap frame providing  a  one-size-fits-all  configuration.  Each  spectacle  is  marked  with  a  serial number  and  identification  code  on  the  frame.  JCAS  is  visually  compatible  with JHMCS (Joint Helmeted Mounted Cueing System) display and designed to work with the  40%  JHMCS  visor.  Required  design  eliminated  prescription  capability  and reduced field of regard coverage (compared to Block 1) to accommodate fit in limited space behind the JHMCS visor. (T-1) 2.10.3.3.2.  JCAS  spectacles  implement  technologies  that  reflect  or  absorb  specific laser wavelengths.  JCAS will minimize temporary  effects  (e.g., dazzle or glare) and permanent eye damage from lasers of selected wavelengths in UV, visible, and NIR. JCAS does not provide vision correction for prescription wearers and is not designed for night use. JCAS spectacles are optimized for day use with 40% JHMCS visor and are fit compatible with JHMCS helmet/visor/mask system. (T-1) 2.10.3.3.3.  Wearing JCAS may cause some difficulty in determining actual color of lighting  and  may  cause  some  color  shifts.  Aircrew  should  receive  specific  training unique  to  JCAS  to  ensure  they  can  identify  lighting  patterns  and  color  shifts  while wearing the device. JCAS spectacles are day-only devices optimized for performance and protection with 40% JHMCS visor. JCAS is not intended for night use. Always 24 AFI11-301V2  20 DECEMBER 2013 store  JCAS  in  the  protective  case  to  prevent  unnecessary  solarization  of  the  lenses. (T-1) 2.10.3.3.4.  Fitting  JCAS.  JCAS  is  provided  in  one  size  to  fit  all  users.  AFE Technicians  fit  JCAS  to  pilots  by  adjusting  temple  arms  and  nose  pads  to accommodate oxygen mask and JHMCS visor while providing optimal lens coverage over each eye. Spectacles must be properly fitted prior to use in a laser hazard/threat area. Specific fitting instructions are contained in the JCAS Technical Manual. (T-1) 2.10.3.3.5.  JCAS Pre-Use  Inspection and Maintenance.  Inspect  JCAS  spectacles for visible lens scratches or frame damage. Use only the cleaning cloth/bag provided or high quality lens tissue for wiping the lens. Always store spectacles in protective case when not in use.

Document  spectacle  inspections  in  the applicable  tracking  system.  The  JCAS  frame  and  lenses  will  be  inspected  for damage or defects. (T-1) 2.10.3.3.6.2.  Inspect  lenses  for  signs  of  delamination.  Delamination  can  be verified  by  carefully  looking  through  spectacle  lenses  from  a  distance  of approximately  12  inches.  Delamination  will  look  like  growth  rings  on  a  tree cross-section, a series of partial  rings or slight  color differences  from  rest  of the lens.  Delamination  usually  starts  in  the  corners  of  the  lens.  Except  in  extreme cases,  delamination  does  not  diminish  laser  protection  properties.  Do  not  use  if either lens shows signs of delamination between front and rear polycarbonate that affects aircrew vision or exceeds 4 mm in any direction. (T-1) 2.10.3.3.6.3.

Marking:  units  will  mark  the  ABA  with  a  local  control  number  on  the upper left cover area.  Stencil with subdued, indelible ink using 1/2 inch lettering.  Do not mark ABA with unit designation, since aircrew may need this item in an escape and evasion environment. (T-1) 2.18.  Aeromedical Evacuation Aircrew Member Support.  Lead Command—AMC. 2.18.1.  It is the responsibility of the local AFE program assigned to support the Aeromedical Evacuation  Squadron(s)  to  individually  issue  AFE  to  AECMs  for  flying  sorties  and deployments.  (T-1) 2.18.2.  AECM unit commanders will, through active coordination with their supporting AFE unit, develop a process for AECMs to sign out AFE from their supporting AFE unit.  AECMs will sign out AFE individually on AF Form 1297 or equivalent and be personally accountable and  liable  for  assigned  AFE.    AECMs  will  return  assigned  AFE  to  the  AFE  unit  upon completion of flying sortie and deployment.  AECMs will ensure AFE receives inspection by a qualified AFE technician at established intervals.  Funding of initial asset purchases is the responsibility of the AE unit.  (T-1) 2.18.3.  AFE  unit  commanders  will,  through  active  coordination  with  their  supported  AE unit,  individually  issue  AFE  to  AECMs  for  all  flying  sorties  and  deployments.    AFE  units will  maintain  a  pool  of  equipment  (see  below)  to  support  the  maximum  number  of  AECM flyers/deployers  at  a  given  time.    Funding  of  repair  parts/replacement  assets  is  the responsibility of the AFE unit.  (T-1) 2.18.4.  AFE requirements for AECMs: 2.18.4.1.  Quick  Don  Oxygen  Mask:    Required  for  all  flights  and  inspected  IAW applicable technical orders by AFE personnel.  (T-1) 2.18.4.2.  Survival  Vest:    Required  for  combat  flights  only.    Munitions  are  optional  for AECM vests.  Ensure alternative signaling devices are available IAW AOR SPINS.  AFE transported via commercial air should have items removed that are considered hazardous or unacceptable by TSA standards. (T-1) 44 AFI11-301V2  20 DECEMBER 2013 2.18.4.3.  Aircrew  Body  Armor:    Required  for  combat  flights  only.    AFE  will  inspect ABA IAW applicable TO, guidance in this instruction and specific MAJCOM guidance. 2.18.4.4.  Life  Preserver  Units  (LPU).    LPUs  are  required  for  overwater  flights  only.  Passenger  style  life  preservers  are  installed  on  all  MAF  aircraft  and  are  available  for AECMs to use in lieu of LPU-10/P. (T-1) 2.18.5.  AFE AECM Deployment Support: 2.18.5.1.  AECMs will depart home station with all required AFE items.  AFE assets will not be staged at stateside hubs or deployed locations. (T-1) 2.18.5.2.  Stateside  locations  where  AECMs  have  stage/hub  operations  do  not  always have  AFE  support.    Permanent  party/host  wing  AFE  functions  at  these  locations  will develop  support  agreements  to  ensure  AECMs  are  supported.    Support  will  include  but not  limited  to  equipment  maintenance  and  security.    Bases  with  multiple  MDS  and MAJCOMs will support this effort jointly.  (T-1) 2.18.5.3.  Overseas  AE  operations  requiring  UTC  9ALAE  support  do  not  possess  a logistics  detail  (LOGDET)  therefore  tools,  testers,  benchstock,  and  facilities  may  be limited.    AFE  technicians  deploying  for  this  UTC  will  require  deployed  host  wing support.    Deployed  AFE  Superintendents/Flight  Chiefs  will  ensure  UTC  9ALAE technicians and AECMs have required AFE support. (T-1) 2.19.  Passenger Demonstration Kits.  Lead Command—AMC.  (T-1) 2.19.1.  Passenger-carrying  aircraft  will  have  a  set  of  demonstration  AFE  mirroring  all onboard  individually  issued  passenger  equipment  (i.e.,  LPUs,  EPOS,  oxygen  masks,  etc.).  Do not include LPU-6/P LPUs as part of the demonstration kit. (T-1) 2.19.2.  To  keep  this  equipment  segregated  from  operational  assets,  store  demonstration equipment  in  a  “red”  locally  manufactured  storage  container.    Stencil  both  the  storage container and  each piece of AFE  "FOR DEMONSTRATION  ONLY" in  1/2-inch black (or contrasting  color)  lettering.    Factory  stenciled  items  such  as  Training  EPOS  in  original yellow bags already stenciled “FOR TRAINING ONLY” is acceptable. (T-1) 2.19.3.  Store the demonstration EPOS in the yellow “training” pouch. (T-1) 2.19.4.  Inspect  and  inventory  on  a  30-day  cycle  and  as  part  of  a  Mission  Termination Inspection (MTI).  Because the items in the passenger demonstration kit  are not  considered serviceable  for  emergency  use,  the  inspection  and  inventory  consists  of  ensuring  all  the required  items  are  contained  within  the  kit,  marked  properly,  and  meet  their  intended purpose.

General Aircraft Installed/Pre-positioned AFE Guidance. 3.1.1.  All items in this chapter are waiver authority T-1 unless otherwise specified. 3.1.2.  In the event installed AFE inspections come due while the aircraft is on alert status or away from home-station, follow guidance per TO 00-20-1. 3.1.3.  For LFA, AFE will be loaded and configured per the aircraft-specific AFI 11-2MDS Series Volume 3, Addenda A.  If no MDS Specific Addenda A is published, units will follow the  aircraft  configuration  guidance  in  this  instruction  or  applicable  MAJCOM  or  unit supplement  to  this  instruction.    AETC  and  AFMC  units  have  unique  mission  requirements and  may  deviate  from  this  instruction  per  guidance  provided  by  their  respective  MAJCOM AFE Management Office.  (T-1) 3.1.4.  When  mission  requirements  dictate,  Operations  Group  commanders  (or  equivalent) are  authorized  to  increase  aircraft  equipment  configurations  provided  the  changes  are  in compliance with this instruction, applicable TOs, and allowance standard authorizations.  (T-3). 3.1.5.  Shortages noted by the aircraft commander or designated representative and recorded on  AFTO  Form  46,  Prepositioned  Aircrew  Flight  Equipment  (or  computer  generated equivalent), will be investigated by the AFE section.  The investigating activity will request assistance in locating shortages from the station where the loss was discovered.  (T-3). 3.1.6.  When  equipment  shortages  are  discovered  which  have  not  been  documented  on  the AFTO  Form  46  (or  computer  generated  equivalent),  the  AFE  section  will  investigate  and take  action  IAW  AFMAN  23-220,  Reports  of  Survey  for  Air  Force  Property.    For  audit purposes, units will document all investigative actions taken.  (T-3). 3.1.7.  When AFE owned by other units is discovered during the inventory, notify the owning unit’s  AFE  section,  citing  type  aircraft,  tail  number,  and  type  and  quantity  of  equipment found.  Do  not  retain  AFE;  forward  it  to  the  owning  unit  by  Issue  Priority  Designator  02 (IPD-02).  Copies of shipping documents will be forwarded to owning organizations.  (T-3). 3.1.8.  LFA,  flight  equipment  will  be  pre-positioned  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  at  all times  to  provide  mission  flexibility,  especially  when  aircraft  is  away  from  home-station, unless  otherwise  specified  by  11-2MDS  Specific  Volume  3,  Addenda  A.    This  will  reduce excessive  handling  and  damage  of  AFE.    For  multi-place/large  frame  aircraft,  units  will prepare AFTO Form 46 in duplicate.  Units will maintain a file of the original and completed AFTO  Forms  46  by  aircraft  tail  number  for  all  assigned  aircraft  for  historical  purposes.  Purge file copies when a new AFTO Form 46 (or computer generated equivalent) is produced due to equipment information changes.  (T-1) 3.1.9.  LFA MTIs or post-flight inspections will be accomplished on all unit aircraft at home station  or  deployed  locations  where  AFE  personnel  are  present.    AFE  will  ensure  these inspections are conducted after the final  mission of the day or upon return to  home station, 52 AFI11-301V2  20 DECEMBER 2013 temporary duty (TDY) locations, etc.  In cases where aircraft maintenance procedures dictate an  AFE  aircraft  preflight,  AFE  preflight  actions  will  be  the  same  as  those  used  during MTI/post-flight inspections.  However, units required to perform preflight inspections are not required  to  do  both,  preflight  and  MTI/post-flight.    MTI/post-flight  inspections  ensure equipment accountability, serviceability, and cleanliness of pre-positioned flight equipment.  AFE personnel will emphasize oxygen mask cleanliness and serviceability during MTI/post-flight  (or  preflight,  if  applicable)  and  routine  30-day  mask  inspections.    In  the  event  that equipment discrepancies are discovered, units will initiate appropriate actions to correct the deficiency  prior  to  the  next  flight.    If  flight  equipment  is  suspected  of  misuse,  abuse  or shortages  exist,  the  AFEO  or  AFES  will  notify  the  applicable  commander  for  corrective actions.    The  aircrew  preflight  inspection  will  suffice  in  the  event  aircraft/aircrew  are  off-station  with  no  qualified  AFE  support  to  accomplish  MTI/post-flights.    Units  will  use  the back  of  the  AFTO  Form  46  (or  computer  generated  equivalent)  to  document  these inspections.  Units will maintain a copy of the documentation, by tail number, for a minimum of 90 days.  Note: Aircraft on alert status are exempt from MTIs until after they are removed from alert status.  (T-1) 3.1.10.  If circumstances arise that require the removal of flight equipment from an aircraft at en route stations, the individual removing the equipment will annotate the remarks section of the AFTO Form 46 (or computer generated equivalent) with their name, date equipment was removed,  reason  for  removal,  and  all  equipment  disposition  and  destination  information.  That person will forward all of the information to the owning unit no later than 72 hours from removal.  (T-3). 3.1.11.  AFE  will  ensure  all  equipment  inspections  remain  current  for  the  duration  of  the scheduled  mission  when  AFE  support  is  not  deployed.  Ensure  aircraft  AFE  will  have  a minimum  of 60 days remaining on its current  repack and inspection when departing home-station  for  tanker  task  force  operations,  integrated  tanker  unit  deployments  (ITUD),  and  30 days for channel missions, business efforts, aircraft transfers, etc.  (T-2). 3.1.12.  AFE will establish procedures to notify applicable agencies IAW AFI 23-101, Para. 1.2.3.1.1, in the event of loss, suspected abuse, pilferage, or mishandling of equipment.  AFE will investigate missing equipment if not returned/located within 30 days.  Initiate a report of survey IAW AFI 23-101, Para. 5.4.2.6.4. as required.  (T-3). 3.1.13.  AFE  will  establish  procedures  to  notify  applicable  agencies  IAW  AFMAN  23-110, Vol 2, Part 13, Chapter 1, in the event of loss, suspected abuse, pilferage, or mishandling of equipment.  AFE  will  investigate  missing  equipment  if  not  returned/located  within  30  days. Initiate a report of survey IAW AFMAN 23-220, as required.  (T-3). 3.1.14.  Proper corrective actions for off-station losses will include messages by the owning organization  to  en  route  locations  describing  lost  equipment  (include  serial  numbers  for accountable items), TDY duration, and route of off-station aircraft. Send an information copy of the message to MAJCOM AFE office. Document all investigative actions taken for audit purposes.  (T-3). 3.1.15.  AFE  will  transfer  aircraft  IAW  TO  00-20-1  Chapter  8,  Preventive  Maintenance Program  General  Policy  Requirements  and  Procedures,  this  instruction  and  applicable  AFI 11-2MDS-Series Volume 3; Addenda A.  Gaining units will first contact the losing unit if an aircraft is transferred without the appropriate equipment.  In the event the gaining and losing AFI11-301V2  20 DECEMBER 2013 53 unit cannot resolve the discrepancy, the gaining unit will contact its respective MAJCOM for resolution.  Aircraft on loan to another unit in excess 30 days will be handled the same as a transfer,  unless  the  gaining  unit  or  11-2MDS  Series  Volume  3,  Addenda  A  specifies otherwise.  (T-1) 3.1.16.  Equipment shipped for aircraft depot retrievals will have sufficient days remaining at the time of shipment to ensure no impact to flight returning home. (T-1) 3.1.17.  When  aircraft  are  permanently  transferred,  inspection  records  of  installed  AFE  will be mailed or sent electronically to the gaining unit AFE section. (T-1) 3.1.18.  Due to  the lack  of AFE  expertise at  some aircraft Programmed  Depot  Maintenance (PDM)  locations,  maintenance  and  equipment  accountability  can  be  provided  only  by  the organization owning the aircraft.  (T-1) 3.1.19.  Upon PDM arrival of AFGSC aircraft, AFE will be shipped back to the owning unit where CA/CRL accountability will remain throughout the PDM duration. (T-1) 3.1.20.  When  aircraft  are  inputted  for  Unprogrammed  Depot  Maintenance  (UDM),  the owning organization will ensure equipment has a minimum of 45 days remaining on repack cycles prior to aircraft departure.  Normally, aircraft are expected to return to the originating organization, but in the event aircraft are not returned to the originator, equipment custodians will initiate appropriate supply action to ensure equipment accountability.  Transfer, receipt, and accountability procedures are set forth in AFI 23-101, and AFI 23-111, Management of Government Property in Possession of the Air Force. (T-1) 3.1.20.1.  For permanent transfer through depot maintenance activity: Sixty days prior to aircraft  scheduled  release  from  PDM,  the  organization  losing  the  aircraft  will  take appropriate  supply  actions  to  ship  full  complement  of  equipment,  excluding  the  depot maintenance  configuration  requirements,  to  the  gaining  base  and  transfer  accountability (e.g.  Full  aircraft  configuration  is  10  parachutes/kits,  and  depot  configuration  is  four parachutes/kits.  The losing unit would ship six parachutes/kits from the complete set to the gaining unit and retain the difference of four parachutes/kits to install on the aircraft for depot input/output.)  (T-1) 3.1.20.2.  Upon  receipt  of  the  transfer  documents,  the  AFE  custodian  must  coordinate with the gaining base supply EMS to ensure the equipment has been received and to take appropriate actions to transfer CA/CRL accountability.  Base supply will take no action to process equipment transfers until the AFE custodian verifies receipt of the equipment.  (T-1) 3.1.20.3.  Delete 3.1.21.  Delete 3.1.22.  Remove flight equipment from aircraft only for recurring inspections or as required for  aircraft  maintenance  (i.e.,  major/minor  ISOs,  home-station  checks  (HSC),  programmed depot  maintenance  (PDM),  etc.)  or  as  directed  in  MDS  specific  configuration  instructions.  Units  will  annotate  AFTO  Form  781A  and  AFTO  Form  46  (or  computer  generated equivalent) when flight equipment is removed from aircraft.  (T-1) 3.1.23.  Establish local procedures to document, control, retrieve, and maintain accountability of  all  transactions  IAW  AFI  23-101,  Para.  5.4.2.7  and  AFI  23-111.    Retrieve  AFE  issued 54 AFI11-301V2  20 DECEMBER 2013 temporarily on AF Form 1297 or equivalent.  AF Form 1297 will have a return date entered in  applicable  block  on  form.    Annotate  “Mobility”  in  the  block  marked  “Return  Date”  on each  AF  Form  1297  for  individual  mobility  equipment  issued  to  crew  members  IAW AFMAN 23-122, Para 5.3.6. (T-1) 3.1.24.  AFE sections are authorized to use a log book in place of AF Forms 1297 for items taken to the support agencies. Flight Chiefs will ensure the log book is current and properly documented to track and account for all items. (T-1) 3.1.25.  Ensure  individual  mobility  equipment  is  issued,  stored,  and  accounted  for  IAW AFMAN 23-122, Para 5.3.6. 3.1.25.1.  MAF  spare  mobility  equipment  (accountable  or  non-accountable)  such  as parachutes, rafts, and vests will be kept in a serviceable and assembled state, in order to have  access  to  a  complete  turnaround  set  during  deployment,  due  to  the  lack  of repack/inspection capacity.  (T-2) 3.1.25.2.  Mobility  equipment  (accountable)  quantities  are  determined  by  LOGDET  and Allowance Standards (AS).  If accountable equipment quantities in the LOGDET do not match  the  AS,  the  UTC  pilot  unit,  with  cooperation  with  non-pilot  units,  will  make corrections  to  the  LOGDET  and  or  request  an  AS  update  through  the  responsible MAJCOM.  (T-2) 3.1.26.  Equipment  exceeding  day-to-day  mission contingencies, may be placed in "serviceable storage."  (T-2). requirements,  but required for 3.1.27.  Maintain  equipment  in  serviceable  storage  in  "ready  for  use”  and  “inspect  prior  to issue"  status  with  time  compliance  technical  orders  (TCTO)  and  modifications  completed.  (T-2). 3.1.28.  Follow  inspection  and  storage  procedures  for  "stored  equipment"  established  in applicable TOs and publications without deviation; not to exceed 12 months. Use DD Form 1574 to identify equipment in serviceable storage.  (T-2). 3.1.29.  Units  will  establish  procedures  to  fit  or  issue  AFE  based  on  local  mission commitments and time constraints.  (T-3). 3.1.30.  When  AFE  has  been  removed  or  identified  as  being  from  transient  aircraft, immediately  notify  the  owning  organization,  citing  type  of  aircraft,  tail  number,  type  and quantity of equipment removed, and present location. Mark assets for gaining AFE unit. Do not  retain  any  AFE  removed  from  en  route  aircraft.  Return  equipment  to  the  owning  unit using Shipping Priority Designator-02, as a minimum.  (T-3). 3.1.31.  Marking  equipment  with  unit  identification  and  related  information  helps  prevent loss  and  expedites  the  return  of  AFE  to  the  owning  organization.  When  assigned,  record serial numbers and/or use local control numbers on required inspection forms to assist AFE in identifying accountable items.  (T-3). 3.1.32.
