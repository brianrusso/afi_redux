Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms.  See Attachment 1. 1.2.  Purpose.  Ensure  available  USAF  international  training  capacity  is  properly  managed  to best  meet  Air  Force  Global  Partnership  Strategy,  Combatant  Command  (COCOM),  and Department of Defense (DoD) security cooperation goals and objectives for Building Partnership Capacity (BPC). 1.3.  Scope.  This  AFI  provides  instruction  for  managing  international  participation  in  RF exercises, including (but not restricted to) the following areas: SAF/IA hosted RF boards, roles and  responsibilities,  international  participant  boarding  and  invitation  processes,  RF  board considerations,  key  goals  and  timelines,  the  Country  Preference  Sheet  (CPS),  RF  assessment criteria  and  spin-up  training  plan  management,  RF  exercise  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS)  case support,  range  Weapons  Danger  Zone  (WDZ)  safety  considerations,  RF  Working  Level Observer  Program  (WLOP),  RF  exercise  ground  participants,  English  language  proficiency requirements,  Pre  and/or  Post-RF  exercise  training  in  the  Continental  United  States  (CONUS) and  Alaska,  media/Public  Affairs  (PA)  support  for  international  participants,  and  after  action reporting and observation guidance. 1.4.  Waivers.  Unless  another  approval  authority  is  cited,  waiver  authority  for  this  AFI  is SAF/IA. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   7  Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  SAF/IA will ensure this AFI is effectively implemented. 2.2.  SAF/IAPX will: 2.2.1.  Schedule,  organize,  facilitate,  and  manage  RF  boards  for  allocation  of  international participation  each  Fiscal  Year  (FY).    RF  boards  are  held  once  each  year,  35  months  (Nov) prior  to  the  FY  being  boarded.  The  results  of  the  RF  board  are  documented  in  the  RF International  Participant  Master  Schedule  which  depicts  the  two  upcoming  FY  schedules along with the country allocations just boarded.  Note: The terms ―boarded,‖ ―allocated,‖ or ―scheduled‖ are synonymous for purposes of this AFI.  All refer to the allocation of countries to the various RF exercises by the RF board. 2.2.2.  Determine  if  each  boarded  country  has  a  Status  of  Forces  Agreement  (SOFA)  or similar  arrangement  with  the  Unites  States  Government  (USG),  in  accordance  with  (IAW) AFI 10-204, Participation in Joint and National Exercises.  Note: this restriction applies to participants in all roles (air, ground and observer). 2.2.3.  No  later  than  (NLT)  39  months  prior  to  FY  being  boarded  (July),  task  SAF/IAR Country Directors to submit the CPS at Attachment 2, to respective countries.  CPSs are due back to SAF/IAPX within two months (NLT 37 months prior). 2.2.4.  NLT  37  months  prior  to  FY  being  boarded  (September),  task  Component  Major Command (C-MAJCOM)/Component Numbered Air Force (C-NAF) to provide a prioritized listing of their countries for RF exercise consideration. 2.2.5.  NLT 36 months prior to FY being boarded (October), consolidate all CPS inputs and create a master spreadsheet depicting the total of all inputs, aligned quarterly for that FY. 2.2.6.  Host RF board for FY being boarded.  RF board management includes: 2.2.6.1.  Invite appropriate representation as explained in paragraph 2.8. 2.2.6.2.  Schedule  an  appropriate  conference  location  with  supporting  materials  and  IT support. 2.2.6.3.  Develop  an  appropriate  agenda  to  address  considerations  and  achieve  the objectives of the RF Board as defined in chapter 3 and chapter 4. 2.2.7.  Within three (3) weeks after the RF board task SAF/IAR Country Directors to notify appropriate regional Country Team Agency (US Embassy (USEMB) staff, Office of Defense Cooperation  (ODC),  Joint  US  Military  Advisory  Group  (JUSMAG),  US  Military  Group (USMILGRP), Defense or Air Attaché (DATT/AIRA), Security Cooperation Office (SCO), etc.) of the proposed country allocations for the FY just boarded.  This early notification is a critical  strategic  planning  step  intended  to  jump-start  the  planning  process  and  ensure international participants and the respective country teams have time to prepare for their RF exercise. 2.2.8.  NLT  34  months  prior  to  the  FY  just  boarded  (within  one  month  after  RF  Board) (December), task C-MAJCOM/C-NAF to complete a Flying Competency Assessment (FCA)   8  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 in accordance with (IAW) chapter 5 and Attachment 3 for applicable countries highlighted in  the  RF  International  Participant  Master  Schedule.    Include  tasking  for  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  to  complete  all  FCAs  within  two  months,  NLT  32  months  (Feb)  prior  to  FY  just boarded. 2.2.9.  NLT 24 months prior to FY just boarded (October), secure CSAF one-time approval of  the  RF  Board  results  (RF  International  Participant  Master  Schedule).    Once  CSAF approves RF Board results: 2.2.9.1.  Notify  Air  Force  Security  Assistance  Center  (AFSAC)  and  Air  Force  Security Assistance  Training  (AFSAT)  Command  Country  Managers  of  approved  board  results (primary  invitees  only)  to  prepare  for  FMS  case  development  and  adjustments  as required. 2.2.9.2.  Notify  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors,  ACC/DS,  PACAF/DS,  13  AF/CS, AFSOUTH/CS,  AFNORTH/CS,  AFCENT/CS,  USAFE/DS,  and  NATO  Country  Team, of RF primary, alternate, ground participant, and observer allocations for all RF exercises in  the  FY  approved  by  CSAF.    Also  notify  them  of  any  changes  to  international allocations that have occurred in the earlier FYs that are part of the RF Board results. 2.2.9.3.  Task  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  to  notify  countries  identified  as  alternates  of potential  RF  exercise  participation  and  responsibility  to  be  ready  for  a  short  notice invitation.    Advise  the  alternates  of  the  expected  deadline  for  accepting/declining  the invitation,  the  necessity  to  prepare  for  any  FMS  case  requirements,  and  any  training requirements,  in  the  event  a  primary  invitee  declines  or  cancels.    Note:  This  requires invitations for alternates to be staffed and signed along with the primary invitations. 2.2.10.  Hold  overall  responsibility  for  drafting,  staffing,  obtaining  SAF/IA  approval  and signature,  and  dissemination  of  all  RF  Invitations  (flying  participants,  ground  participants, and Working Level Observers (WLOs)).  SAF/IAPX will: 2.2.10.1.  Staff  RF  invitations  for  SAF/IA  signature  as  soon  as  CSAF  approves  the  RF Board  results  and  ACC/A3J  confirms  the  final  dates  for  each  exercise,  but  NLT  16 months prior to the start of each RF exercise (STARTEX).  If possible, all RF invitations for  the  entire  FY  should  be  staffed  as  one  group  and,  once  signed,  immediately distributed to the countries; however, do not pass deadlines for an early RF while waiting for final dates of an exercise later in the FY. 2.2.10.2.  Ensure signed RF invitations are formally sent to respective countries NLT 14 months  prior  to  the  STARTEX  of  the  corresponding  RF.    Intent  is  to  get  signed  RF invitations out to the country at the earliest opportunity. 2.2.10.3.  Ensure  RF  invitations  include  the  following  information  to  facilitate  effective and timely communications: 2.2.10.3.1.  SAF/IAPX point of contact (POC) information. 2.2.10.3.2.  Dates for all respective planning conferences (Initial Planning Conference [IPC] and Final Planning Conferences [FPC] as appropriate). 2.2.10.3.3.  RF exercise dates, listed with the first date as the in-processing and initial brief day, the last being the redeployment day. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   9  2.2.10.3.3.1.  RF-N  normally  has in-processing/initial  briefs  beginning  on Saturday  and  end  their  schedule  on  Saturday  after  two  or  three  weeks  of  flying. Example:  For  RF-N  10-4  the  dates  are  Saturday,  17  July  -  Saturday,  31  July 2010. 2.2.10.3.3.2.  RF-A  normally  has in-processing/initial  briefs  beginning  on Thursday  and  end  their  schedule  on  Friday  after  the  two  weeks  of  flying. Example: For RF-A 10-3 dates are Thursday, 10 June - Friday, 25 June 2010. 2.2.10.3.4.  Specific  number  and  type  of  aircraft  and  desired  mission  role(s).    If specifics  are  unknown,  then  as  a  minimum  the  invitation  letter  should  identify  the general aircraft category, an approximate number of aircraft, and the mission set they are being asked to perform: 2.2.10.3.4.1.  Example 1 (specific):  ―…it is our pleasure to invite country XXX to participate in RF-N 11-1 with 12 x F-16 in the Offensive Counter Air (OCA) Air Interdiction (AI) role…‖ 2.2.10.3.4.2.  Example 2 (general):  ―…it is our pleasure to invite country XXX to participate in RF-A 11-2 with up to eight (8) fighter aircraft to perform AI and up to  three  (3)  airlift  aircraft  to  perform  cargo  and  personnel  drops,  austere  airfield operations  and  infiltration/exfiltration  of  ground  personnel  and  equipment resupply…‖ 2.2.10.3.5.  Set a respond NLT date that is two (2) months from the date the invitation is expected to be sent to the country.  This step is important to ensure adequate time to  notify  any  alternates  of  their  ―official‖  invitation  in  the  event  a  primary  country declines. 2.2.10.3.6.  Request  the  country  provide  a  POC  and  send  contact  information  (rank, name,  email  address,  phone  number)  directly  to  the  SAF/IAPX  POC  listed  in  the invitation. 2.2.10.4.  Forward  the  signed  invitations  to  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  for  formal dissemination to  respective countries via the appropriate country team  agency.  Follow-up to ensure the invitations were received by the country’s Air Chief in a timely manner. 2.2.10.5.  Track the responses and follow-up with appropriate SAF/IAR Country Director or country team to ensure countries respond by the specified NLT date. 2.2.10.6.  Submit  alternate  invitations  direct  to  respective  country  team  as  soon  as  a primary  country  declines  or  cancels  their  participation.    Alternate  invitations  must  be delivered  to  countries  NLT  10  months  prior  to  a  given  RF  exercise.    This  is  the ―invitation drop-dead date.‖  Therefore, alternate invitations should already be signed and ready  to  be  mailed  (staff  along  with  the  primary  invitations).    SAF/IAR  Country Directors  will  already  have  informally  told  the  country  of  their  alternate  status  and prepared them for a possible short notice invitation. 2.2.10.7.  Notify  appropriate  RF  Host-MAJCOM  POCs  of  each  country’s  official response as soon as that information is available.  Rapid communication ensures adequate planning time to coordinate the FMS case building processes identified in chapter 6.   10  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 2.2.10.8.  NLT 9 months prior to each STARTEX, provide RF Host-MAJCOM POCs the final list of countries that accepted invitations to that exercise. 2.2.10.9.  Facilitate  the  WDZ  process  as  required.    If  no  WDZs  exist  to  support  a country’s  request,  determine  NLT  9  months  prior  to  STARTEX  (with  AF/A3O-AYR, SAF/IAPX, and SAF/IAR coord) if new WDZs or waivers will be pursued. 2.2.10.10.  Coordinate tanker air refueling waivers. 2.3.  SAF/IAR Country Directors will: 2.3.1.  Provide  the  RF  board  with  supporting  background,  rationale,  and  justification  for International training preferences. 2.3.2.  NLT 2 months prior to the RF board (September), provide SAF/IAPX the CPS from countries in their Area of Responsibility (AOR).  Bring completed CPSs to the RF  board as supporting background. 2.3.3.  Attend the RF board (scheduled approximately each November) to represent the CPSs and provide any political or military considerations for the countries in their AOR. 2.3.4.  In  response  to  SAF/IAPX  tasking  (within  three  weeks  after  the  RF  board),  have respective country team agencies informally notify their country of selection for an upcoming RF exercise.  This early notification is intended to jump-start the planning process and ensure international participants and country teams have time to prepare for RF participation.  Note: The appropriate country team agency varies depending upon how the particular USEMB or SCO  delegates  responsibilities  for  military-to-military  engagement  and  training  assistance.  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  are  responsible  for  understanding  that  relationship  and disseminating information accordingly. 2.3.4.1.  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  will  inform  the  country  of  its  primary  or  alternate status, as well as the date and location of the exercise to which the country will/may be invited. 2.3.4.2.  SAF/IAR Country Directors will disseminate to country teams strategic planning guidance and timelines to include the following, as applicable: 2.3.4.2.1.  FCA and spin-up training processes IAW chapter 5. 2.3.4.2.2.  Range  Safety  WDZ,  Air  Combat  Training  Systems  (ACTS)  pod  carriage and targeting pod/laser designator requirements IAW chapter 6. 2.3.4.2.3.  Tanker air refueling requirements. 2.3.4.2.4.  WLOP instructions IAW chapter 7. 2.3.4.2.5.  English language testing requirements IAW chapter 9. 2.3.5.  Disseminate  the  SAF/IA  signed  RF  invitations  (hard  and  electronic  copies)  to  the appropriate country team agency for delivery to the country’s Air Chief. 2.3.6.  Follow up on country  responses (accept  or decline) to the RF invitation  and provide SAF/IAPX  updates  as  available,  but  NLT  12  months  before  the  start  of  that  country’s  RF exercise. 2.4.  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will: AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   11  2.4.1.  NLT  37  months  prior  to  the  FY  being  boarded  (September),  provide  SAF/IAPX  a prioritized listing of countries to be considered for RF exercise participation IAW chapter 3 and chapter 4. 2.4.2.  NLT 32 months prior to the FY just boarded (February), complete and submit an FCA on respective countries as tasked by SAF/IAPX. 2.4.3.  Coordinate with the country to identify the unit that will participate in the exercise. 2.4.4.  Develop  and  manage  an  appropriate  RF  spin-up  training  plan  for  the  unit(s)  most likely  to  participate  in  the  planned  RF  exercise,  and  IAW  the  Country  Spin-Up  Worksheet (CSW) at Attachment  4.  Also, complete a new FCA or update the existing FCA to assess the specific participating unit(s).  Intent is to give C-MAJCOM/C-NAF time to schedule the unit  for  participation  in  Large  Force  Employment  (LFE)  and  Composite  Force  Exercise (CFE)  type  events  or  spin-up  training  to  ensure  each  unit  meets  RF  assessment  criteria  in chapter 5 before deployment to the RF exercise. 2.4.5.  Provide SAF/IAPX and appropriate RF Host-MAJCOM POC quarterly updates to the progress of that country’s RF spin-up training plan. 2.4.6.  NLT  10  months  prior  to  STARTEX,  provide  SAF/IAPX  and  appropriate  RF  Host-MAJCOM POC a final assessment of that country’s RF spin-up training plan progress.  This is  approximately  three  months  prior  to  the  first  scheduled  planning  conference  (IPC/FPC).  This  final  assessment  is  a  critical  decision  point.    If  the  country  has  not  met  the  FCA requirements  in  chapter  5  then  that  country  will  be  deferred  to  the  next  FY  cycle  and  an alternate may take their place. 2.5.  ACC/A3 will: 2.5.1.  Annually  develop  and  coordinate  the  subsequent  five  year  RF  schedule  with  13 AF/A3. (OPR: ACC/A3J) 2.5.2.  NLT  39  months  prior  to  the  FY  being  boarded  (July),  provide  number  of  available aircraft slots for each RF exercise by mission area. (OPR: ACC/A3J) 2.5.3.  NLT 36 months in advance of the FY being boarded (October), provide SAF/IAPX a 3-year  (FY)  RF  Exercise  Long  Range  Schedule.    Exercises  will  be  allocated  by  month. (OPR: ACC/A3J) 2.5.4.  NLT  16  months  prior  to  each  STARTEX  (or,  if  sooner,  when  finalized),  provide specific  dates  for  each  RF  exercise.  This  ensures  the  RF  invitations  include  correct  dates.

Promote CSAF  goal  to  optimize the  unique opportunities of  RF-A and RF-N.  The RF Board will recommend International Participant allocations to available RF exercises over a 3-year period, to ensure equitable distribution at each location. 3.2.  Board Considerations. 3.2.1.  Security cooperation goals and objectives as outlined in Air Force Global Partnership Strategy, USAF Campaign Support Plan, and C-MAJCOM/C-NAF BPC strategies. 3.2.2.  International  Air  Forces’ background  concerning exercise requirements and goals,  to include  known  or  anticipated improve interoperability. impact  on  coalition  partner  operations to 3.2.3.  Current  political-military  relationship  and  situation,  highlighting  current  coalition partner relationships/goals/areas of concern. 3.2.4.  Past RF attendance or international participant allocations to previous RF exercises. 3.2.5.  FCA  of  previously  considered  international  participants.    Countries  established  in  a RF  spin-up  training  plan  that  were  deferred  from  a  previous  year  will  be  given  priority consideration for allocation to a RF exercise in the FY being boarded. 3.2.6.  CPS  for  potential international  participants,  to  include  exercise  GREEN  FLAG  (GF) requests. 3.2.7.  Impact on USAF, DoD and other international participants’ exercise goals. 3.2.8.  Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) availability.  The RF board will attempt to maximize AEF  preparation  within  the  known  deployment  cycles  and  ensure  appropriate  countries  are allocated to RF exercises in direct support of AEF spin-up. 3.2.9.  The RF Board will review the list of international participants previously boarded for upcoming exercises in addition to allocating participants for the new FY. 3.2.10.  RF  Host-MAJCOM  inputs  for  number  of  available  slots,  mission  types  or  possible restrictions that may affect country selection. 3.2.11.  Exercise  security  classification  (e.g.  TS/SCI,  SECRET  RELEASABLE,  or UNCLASSIFIED). The RF board will take into consideration USAF AEF requirements and expected  participation  of  USAF  aircraft  that  mandate  specific  security  classifications.    RF board will ensure countries are matched to appropriate RF exercises based on that country’s disclosure authorization level. 3.2.12.  The RF board will consider a country’s experience with LFE, CFE and RF exercises, especially if they are a first time or long absent RF participant. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   15  Chapter 4 RF BOARD TIMELINE 4.1.  A pictorial depiction.   of the RF Planning Timeline/associated actions is at Attachment 5. 4.2.  Pre-Board Actions.   4.2.1.  SAF/IAPX  will  host  a  RF  board  annually  each  November  in  order  to  schedule international participants into RF exercises.   The RF board will plan for the Fiscal Year that begins  three  (3)  years  after  the  board  date.    Example:  The  November  2009  RF  board  will allocate positions for FY13 RF exercises. The Nov 09 board is the “FY13 RF Board.” 4.2.2.  NLT  39  months  prior  to  the  start  of  the  FY  being  allocated  by  the  next  RF  board (July),  ACC/A3J  will  provide  number  of  available  aircraft  slots  for  each  RF  exercise  by mission area.  Example: July 2009 for the November 2009 RF Board (FY13 RF Board). 4.2.2.1.  ACC/A3JE  will  provide  SAF/IAPX  a  3-year  (FY)  RF  Exercise  Long  Range Schedule.  RF exercises will be listed by month. 4.2.2.2.  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  will  request  countries  in  their  region  complete  a CPS (Attachment 2) for a 3-year look ahead. 4.2.3.  NLT  37  months  prior  to  the  boarded  FY  start  (September),  SAF/IAR  Country Directors will provide all completed CPS to SAF/IAPX for consolidation. 4.2.4.  NLT  37  months  prior  to  the  boarded  FY  start  (September),  SAF/IAPX  will  task  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  to  provide  a  prioritized  listing  of  countries  for  future  RF  exercise consideration IAW Air Force Global Partnership Strategy and Guidance for Employment of the Force. 4.2.4.1.  SAF/IAPX will consolidate inputs from CPS and C-MAJCOM/C-NAF priorities to  create  a  master  spreadsheet  depicting  the  total  of  all  countries’  preferences  and priorities, aligned quarterly within the FY being boarded. 4.2.4.2.  SAF/IAPX,  in  consultation  with  SAF/IARW  and  SAF/IAPD,  will  categorize countries into appropriate disclosure authorization groups. 4.3.  RF Board is held at 35 months prior to the FY being boarded (November). 4.3.1.  Review upcoming three (3) FYs prior to allocating countries to the FY being boarded. Make any changes as required and update the RF International Participant Master Schedule.  Highlight those countries that declined or canceled participation. 4.3.2.  Schedule primary and alternate countries (flyers) to the FY being boarded. 4.3.3.  Schedule ground participants to the FY being boarded. 4.3.4.  Schedule  observers,  for  new  participants  (never  participated  in  a  RF  or  have  not participated  in  a  RF  within  the  last  36  months),  to  the  FY  that  is  one  year  prior  to  their planned participation.  Example:  If country X is planned to participate with aircraft in a RF in FY14 then they will be scheduled (boarded) to observe a RF in FY13.  Every effort should be made to schedule observers at the same exercise location as that in which the country is planned to participate with aircraft the following year.   16  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 4.3.5.  Note potential opportunities to satisfy any GF requests listed on CPS. 4.3.6.  The  results  of  the  RF  Board  are  documented  in  the  RF  International  Participant Master Schedule which depicts country allocations to the FY just boarded as well as the two previous years’ FY allocations/schedules. 4.4.  Post-Board Actions. 4.4.1.  Within  three  weeks  after  the  RF  board  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  will  request respective Country Teams informally notify each country of selection for participation in an upcoming RF exercise.  This early notification is a critical strategic planning step intended to jump-start  the  planning  process  and  ensure  International  Participants,  as  well  as  the respective Country Teams, have the most time to prepare for planned RF participation. 4.4.1.1.  Inform  the  country  of  its  primary  or  alternate  status,  as  well  as  the  date  and location of the exercise to which the country will/may be invited. 4.4.1.2.  Disseminate  to  Country  Teams  strategic  planning  guidance  and  timelines  IAW paragraph 2.3.4.2. 4.4.2.  CSAF  approval  of  RF  Board  results  is  desired  NLT  24  months  prior  to  FY  just boarded (October).  Example:  NLT October 2010 for the FY13 RF Board. 4.4.2.1.  Within three weeks after the RF board, SAF/IAPX will submit the board results to  the  following  for  coordination:  COMACC,  COMPACAF,  COMUSAFE,  AFCENT, AFSOUTH, AFNORTH, AFAFRICA. 4.4.2.2.  Within three weeks after the RF board, SAF/IAPX will info the board results to: 5  AF/CC,  7  AF/CC,  11  AF/CC,  13  AF/CC,  AF/A3/5,  AF/CC-POLAD,  SAF/IAR Country Directors. 4.4.2.3.  Informal notification (electronic or verbal) of country  allocations may be made by SAF/IA to AF/CV or CSAF well in advance of the 24 month approval deadline, with the understanding there  will be countries that require a  FCA  and associated RF spin-up training  plan,  This  will  ensure  maximum  opportunity  for  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  to implement  pre-exercise  requirements.    Formal  confirmation  to  countries  will  follow  the official CSAF approval. 4.4.3.  NLT  34  months  prior  to  FY  just  boarded  (December),  SAF/IAPX  will  task  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  to  complete  a  FCA  for  applicable  countries  in  their  respective  AORs, IAW chapter 5 and Attachment 3. 4.4.3.1.  NLT 32 months prior to FY just boarded (February), C-MAJCOM/C-NAF must submit completed FCA to SAF/IAPX and RF-Host-MAJCOM/POCs. 4.4.3.2.  NLT  29  months  prior  to  FY  just  boarded  (May),  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  should develop a RF spin-up training plan to ensure adequate time to complete the plan prior to deployment (see Attachment 4, CSW). 4.4.3.2.1.  If the C-MAJCOM/C-NAF determines the country cannot be ready for the RF  exercise  in  the  FY  just  boarded,  the  country  should  be  considered  for  the  next cycle. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   17  4.4.3.2.2.  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  will  provide  quarterly  updates  on  the  status  of  each country’s  progress  toward  completing  the  RF  spin-up  training  plan.    Quarterly updates will be given to SAF/IAPX and respective RF Host-MAJCOM POCs. 4.4.3.2.3.  NLT 10 months prior to STARTEX, if the country is on track to meet the RF  Assessment  Criteria,  then  a  final  update  from  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  to  RF-Host MAJCOM POC will secure that country’s participation in the planned RF exercise. 4.4.3.2.4.  NLT 10 months prior to STARTEX, if a country  has not or will not meet the criteria identified in chapter 5 and CSW Attachment 4 prior to deployment, the RF Host-MAJCOM POC will recommend SAF/IA defer that country’s participation to a future RF exercise. 4.4.4.  As  soon  as  CSAF  approves  the  RF  Board  results,  SAF/IAPX  will  disseminate approved  FY  allocations  to  all  organizations  listed  in  paragraph  4.4.2.1  and  paragraph 4.4.2.2 as well as direct to  RF Host-MAJCOM POCs, 414 CTS/CC, and 353 CTS/CC. 4.4.5.  NLT  24  months  prior  to  the  FY  just  boarded  (October),  ACC/A3JE  will  provide SAF/IAPX an updated 3-year (FY) RF Exercise Long Range Schedule.  Update will include all specific dates for each exercise and associated PCs, as available. 4.4.6.  As soon as available but  NLT 16 months prior to  each RF exercise, ACC/A3JE will provide SAF/IAPX the finalized dates for that exercise. 4.4.7.  NLT  14  months  prior  to  each  RF  exercise,  SAF/IA’s  RF  invitations  are  delivered  to each country by SAF/IAR Country Directors through the respective country team. 4.4.8.  NLT 12 months prior to each RF exercise, SAF/IAR Country Directors will verify the country’s  response  to  RF  invitation  (aircraft  participant,  ground  participant,  and  WLO invitations as applicable) and notify SAF/IAPX of accept or decline status.  SAF/IAPX will notify  ACC/A3JE  and  PACAF/A5I  of  finalized  county  participants  (all  categories:  aircraft, ground  or  WLO).    ACC/A3JE  and  PACAF/A5I  will  notify  respective  CTS  team  chiefs  of final country participants. 4.4.9.  Ten months prior to each STARTEX is the ―invitation drop-dead date‖ for extending invitations to alternates for a given RF exercise.  There is very little time between when the primary  participants  must  respond  NLT  and  when  the  alternates  must  be  formally  invited.  For this reason, it is imperative the SAF/IAR Country Directors informally notify respective countries of alternate status once CSAF approves the RF board results. 4.4.10.  Foreign  Visit  Requests  (FVR):  45-days  prior  to  any  planned  visit  by  international participants (planning conferences and RF exercises) a FVR for all attending personnel must be submitted through the country’s embassy channels.   18  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 Chapter 5 RF ASSESSMENT CRITERIA 5.1.  General Aircrew Requirements: 5.1.1.  A minimum of 500 hours total time and a minimum of 150 hours in type aircraft. 5.1.2.  Must be Combat Mission Ready IAW country directives. 5.1.3.  Demonstrated  English  Language  Proficiency  (English  Comprehension  Level  (ECL) and Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI)): 5.1.3.1.  Aircrew  and  controllers  participating  in  RF  as  Aircraft  Commander,  Co-Pilot/Second-in-Command, or in a position to communicate with other aircraft must score a minimum 85 ECL.  A 2/2 OPI may be used in lieu of this ECL requirement (secondary option). 5.1.3.2.  Mission and Package Commanders must take both tests and score a minimum 85 ECL and 2+/2+ OPI. 5.1.3.3.  RF Host-MAJCOM/CC is the waiver authority for ECL and OPI requirements. 5.2.  Preparatory  Requirements.  RF  participants  must  meet  the  following  requirements  in order to ensure no adverse impact on other RF participants’ training: 5.2.1.  Plan  and  Execute.    Planned  participating  unit  must  have  flown  in  a  LFE  or  CFE exercise that includes USAF participation within the last 36 months.  The LFE or CFE must include three (3) or more flights (different units) of aircraft in different supporting missions (i.e. OCA escort, AI, SEAD). 5.2.2.  Adhere to USAF Training Rules.  Planned participating unit understands and complies with USAF Training Rules and restrictions. 5.2.3.  Demonstrates  English  competency.    Planned  participating  unit  can  safely  operate under US Air Traffic Control so as not to pose a hazard to civilian/military aircraft or impede recovery and traffic pattern operations. 5.2.4.  Demonstrates Air-to-Air Refueling (AR) proficiency as applicable.  Any international participant  unit  planning  to  conduct  AR  with  USAF  Tanker  aircraft  as  part  of  a  RF deployment  (CORONET)  or  any  fighter  unit  planning  to  conduct  AR  during  RF  exercise participation  must  be  able  to  safely  conduct  AR  in  accordance  with  USAF  Air  Refueling procedures,  AFI  10-204  guidance  and  ATP-56  (B)  restrictions  as  applicable  (NATO signatories).    ATP  56  (B)  provides  NATO  aircrews  with  internationally  standardized definitions, abbreviations and procedures to enable successful and safe AAR operations. 5.3.  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will be tasked to provide a FCA on countries in their AOR. 5.3.1.  If a country does not meet the requirements of  paragraph 5.2, C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will  develop  a  RF  spin-up  training  plan.  All  critical  stages  of  the  RF  spin-up  training  plan will be included on the country’s CSW (Attachment 4). AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   19  5.3.2.  If a country meets the requirements of paragraph  5.2 but has never participated in a RF,  a  RF  spin-up  training  plan  is  not  required  but  the  country  will  be  allocated  to  a  RF exercise appropriate for ―first time‖ participants. 5.4.  RF Spin-Up Training Plan Management. 5.4.1.  International participants that require a RF spin-up training plan will be monitored for completion  of  required  events  IAW  the  CSW  (Attachment  4).    Note:  USAF  provision  of training  requires  an  FMS  case,  unless  training  is  conducted  under  other  express  legal authority that permits training international participants. 5.4.2.  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will be OPR for completion of the RF spin-up training plan, in coordination  with  US  country  team,  as  appropriate.    OPR  will  provide  quarterly  updates  to the  CSW  monitoring  office(s)  on  milestone  progress  to  ensure  all  required  events  are recorded. 5.4.3.  CSW  monitoring  offices  are  RF  Host-MAJCOM  POCs,  SAF/IAPX  and  applicable SAF/IAR Country Directors. 5.4.4.  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF will provide a final update of each country’s progress in the RF spin-up training plan NLT 10 months prior to STARTEX.  This final update is the decision point  to  determine  if  yes,  they  will  participate,  or  no,  they  will  not,  then  they  must  be deferred to the next FY cycle.   20  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 Chapter 6 PARTICIPANT REQUIREMENTS AND PREPARATION 6.1.  US  Government  (USG)  cost  recovery  requirement.  A(n) signed FMS case,  an existing Acquisition Cross Servicing  Agreement (ACSA)  or Standing NATO Agreement (STANAG) is required before the RF exercise start date.  RF-A FMS case OPR is PACAF/A5I, ACSA OPR is PACAF/A4.  RF-N FMS case OPR is ACC/A3TS, ACSA OPR is ACC/A4RX. 6.1.1.  An FMS case is also referred to as a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA). 6.1.1.1.  RF-N FMS case support.  USG owned general purpose vehicles (pick-up trucks, vans,  buses,  and  sedans)  are  not  available  for  issue  to  international  participants.    The FMS case for RF-N will cover transportation costs of foreign personnel and equipment in USG vehicles when driven by  US  individuals, but  will not  cover  rental,  lease or use of commercial  or  Government  Sales  Agency  (GSA)  general  purpose  vehicles  issued  to foreign operators.  Countries are expected to make their own arrangements with national funds.  The visiting country is also responsible for making lodging (hotel) arrangements as on base billeting will most likely not be available.  Countries are expected to have their own aeronautical charts and required Flight Information Publications. 6.1.1.2.  RF-A FMS case support.  USG owned general purpose and special use vehicles, and vehicles leased by the USG (GSA contracted) are available for use by international participants under an FMS case or ACSA order that ensures reimbursement to the USG.  Payment for GSA vehicles within an FMS case requires a waiver from Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) and the lease agreement must authorize non-USG drivers.  Any Government vehicle issued to an international participant is restricted to use on-base or  on  the  ranges  only.    International  participants  will  be  responsible  for  arranging  and paying  for  all  other  local  transportation.    Lodging  will  likely  be  on-base  in  billeting rooms or contingency dorms.  Lodging will not be covered by the FMS case but will be direct-pay by the participating forces.  For RF-A, the FMS case will also cover costs of exercise  augmentees  and  dining  facility  contract  surge  costs  on  a  fair-share  basis.  Countries  are  expected  to  have  their  own  aeronautical  charts  and  required  Flight Information Publications. 6.1.1.3.  If an FMS case is used to reimburse the USG, the FMS case OPR (ACC/A3TS or PACAF/A5I) will provide price and availability (P&A) data to AFSAC/AFSAT within 30 days after the IPC (or FPC if no IPC is held). 6.1.1.4.  The  FMS  case  should  be  signed  and  implemented  NLT  30  days  before  RF exercise start. 6.1.2.  ACSAs  are  cross-servicing  agreements  the  DoD  has  entered  into  with  many  foreign governments with the authority to allow provision of logistics support, supplies, and services on a reimbursable basis.  If support is to be provided by an order under an ACSA it must be approved by the appropriate OPR.  Note that an ACSA can be used to provide lodging and temporary use of USG general purpose vehicles, but cannot be used to provide munitions for RF.    Specific  ACSA  guidance  is  contained  in  AFI  25-301  Acquisition  and  Cross-Servicing Agreement  (ACSA)  between  the  United  States  Air  Force  and  Other  Allied  and  Friendly Forces and DoDD 2010.9 Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   21  6.2.  Initiation  of  planning  process  and  POCs.  Once  a  country  accepts  a  RF  invitation,  the MAJCOM  OPR  will  contact  SAF/IAR  Country  Director  to  begin  the  planning  process.    The SAF/IAR  Country  Director  will  obtain  POC(s)  within  the  country’s  Air  Force  for  gathering required information. 6.3.  Pre  and/or  post-RF  exercise  requests  for  training.  If  the  invited  country  desires additional training or will attend another exercise outside the assigned RF exercise, the country must  provide  the  SAF/IAR  Country  Director  and  MAJCOM  OPR  a  minimum  of  1  year  (12 months) advance notice prior to RF exercise STARTEX.   Advance notice may be informal (i.e. the official Letter of Request does not have to be submitted 1 year early), but notice must be sent through  the  SAF/IAR  Country  Director.    Securing  a  host  location  and  building  an  additional FMS case is a lengthier process than participating in RF alone. 6.3.1.  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  will  coordinate  with  MAJCOM  OPRs  to  coordinate  a suitable US location to accomplish desired training. 6.3.2.  Countries  will  not  be  allowed  to  perform  spin  up  training  prior  to  the  exercise  or allowed to stay for post exercise training at Nellis AFB. 6.4.  Range safety Weapons Danger Zone requirements.  Twelve (12) to nine (9) months prior to  the  RF  exercise  the  country  should  provide  a  list  of  potential  aircraft/munitions/tactics combinations  to  the  SAF/IAR  Country  Director  to  ensure  proper  WDZ  footprints  exist.  SAF/IAR Country Director, SAF/IAPX and MAJCOM range OPR must determine if new WDZs or waivers will be pursued.  Requests for footprint development, targets, and other range services must  be  covered  under  an  FMS  case  or  other  arrangement  in  accordance  with  law.    Up  to  six months may be required to develop new WDZ footprints and funding must be available before development begins. 6.5.  Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) or ACTS Pod requirements.  NLT nine  (9)  months  prior  to  RF  exercise  international  participants  should  coordinate  through  the SAF/IAR  Country  Director  for  carriage  approval  and  flight  clearance  of  the  RF  ACMI/ACTS pod.    It  is  imperative  pod  requirements  are  identified  as  early  as  possible  since  the  process  to obtain flight clearances may be lengthy.  A memo from the participating country certifying flight carriage is required prior to final planning conference and must be signed by at least the first O-6/colonel or equivalent in unit operations or maintenance chain of command.  Requests for pod Stores  and  Mass  Property  (STAMP)  data  should  be  made  through  the  SAF/IAR  Country Director. 6.6.  Targeting  pods  and  laser  designators.  NLT  nine  (9)  months  prior  to  RF  exercise international  participants  should  provide  a  list  of  targeting  pods  and  laser  designators  to  the SAF/IAR  Country  Director.    All  lasers  must  be  approved  for  use  within  the  US  and  the  range must have an accurate safety footprint available.  New laser certification requests will be covered under an FMS case or other arrangement in accordance with law. 6.7.  Communications Security (COMSEC) Material. 6.7.1.  The RF CTS COMSEC custodian (and the CAOC-N COMSEC custodian for RF-N) will  send  an  ―Intent  to  Use/COMSEC  Call  Out‖  message  to  all  RF  participants’  COMSEC custodians  NLT  60  days  from  the  RF  Advanced  Echelon  (ADVON)  arrival  date.    The  call out message will inform all participants of what keying material (KEYMAT) short titles will   22  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 be required to operate during the RF Exercise.  See Amendment 10 for KEYMAT ordering procedures. 6.7.2.  KEYMAT  short  titles  should  be  communicated  to  international  participants  well  in advance  of  the  60  day  deadline  whenever  possible.    Early  knowledge  allows  POCs  time  to determine if the control  authority  will release KEYMAT to  the  country  and take corrective action if needed. 6.8.  Letter of Request (LOR).  A LOR is required to begin the FMS case building process.  RF FMS  case  OPR  (ACC/A3TS  or  PACAF/A5I)  and  SAF/IAR  Country  Director  will  assist participating  country  POCs  in  the  construction  of  the  RF  LOR.    See  Attachment  6  Suggested LOR Format. 6.8.1.  The  country  should  provide  a  draft  LOR  for  coordination  comments  NLT  two  (2) months  prior  to  the  first  RF  planning  conference  (IPC/FPC).    Note:  There  are  some  RF exercises that do not have an IPC.  A single planning conference, also called a FPC, will be held instead. 6.8.2.  The official signed LOR should be submitted prior to the IPC for RF-N Exercises, and prior to IPC or FPC for RF-A Exercises.  There will be RF-A Exercises that do not have an IPC.  Instead RF-A will hold a single planning conference also called a FPC. 6.8.3.  The country should include the following information in the LOR: 6.8.3.1.  Exercise period and date. 6.8.3.2.  Type/number of aircraft deployed (including tankers and transports). 6.8.3.3.  Number of pilots/aircrews. 6.8.3.4.  Number sorties per day, hours per sortie. 6.8.3.5.  Air  refueling  desired  during  the  exercise,  type  required  (boom  or  probe-and-drogue). 6.8.3.6.  Additional requests such as Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTAC), Personnel Recovery (PR), and Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC [RF-N only]). 6.8.3.7.  Mission roles (Air-to-Air, Air-to-Ground, or support sorties).  Specify if desired Air-to-Air participation is in dedicated OCA, swing role, or DCA role.  Specify if desired Air-to-Ground  participation  is  for  Air  Interdiction  (AI),  Suppression  of  Enemy  Air Defenses (SEAD), or Close Air Support (CAS) role. 6.8.3.8.  Munitions. 6.8.3.8.1.  Provide  a  list  of  planned  munitions  to  be  shipped  by  the  participating nation.    Barge  shipments  of  munitions  to  Alaska  occur  only  twice  a  year,  requiring long lead-times for planning 6.8.3.8.2.  Identify  combinations  of  aircraft  type,  munitions  delivery  tactics,  (release altitude,  dive  angle,  airspeed),  and  types  of  desired  targets.    This  information  is critical  to  USAF  range  use  approval.  (See  paragraph  6.4,  and  AFI  13-212,  Range Planning  and  Operations  WDZ  requirements).  WDZs  development  timeline  may require  separate  FMS  case  funding  NLT  six  (6)  months  prior  to  RF  exercise AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   23  STARTEX.)  Certification of munitions and lasers to be used must be verified by RF Host-MAJCOM and CTS Range Divisions prior to use on USAF ranges. 6.8.3.8.3.  List  the  type  and  number  requested  for  purchase  through  FMS  case  (i.e., MK-82 high drag live, MK-82 low drag inert).  Provide US National Stock Numbers (NSNs) and/or Complete Round Codes (CRCs) if available.  Note: USAF munitions stocks are limited.  There is no guarantee that they will be available under the FMS case.    Early  identification  of  type  and  numbers,  in  advance  of  the  official  LOR, greatly  increases  chances  for  availability.    Countries  should  have  alternate  plans  for bringing their own munitions. 6.8.3.9.  Targeting  pod  type(s),  laser  designators  and  associated  operating  modes,  and ECM involved. 6.8.3.10.  Method  of  deployment.    Explain the  level  of  support  requested  and  if  already covered by existing FMS cases or other agreements in accordance with law. 6.8.3.11.  ACC/Air  Operations  Squadron  (AOS)  ferry  support  (planning  and/or  any enroute assistance). 6.8.3.12.  USAF  Tanker  support.    Costs  for  tanker  O&M  hours  must  be  charged  to  the FMS case. This also includes all refueling during the RF exercise. 6.8.3.13.  USAF airlift support. 6.8.3.14.  Country  should  identify  method  of  AVPOL  payment.    AVPOL  is  usually covered  by  existing  agreements  outside  of  FMS  case  such  as  that  nation’s  Defense Energy  Support  Center  (DESC)  Department  of  Defense  Activity  Address  Code (DoDAAC) account, but may be placed within FMS if necessary or desired. 6.8.3.15.  Request  for  USAF  maintenance  liaison,  if  desired.    Maintenance  liaisons  are highly encouraged as they can facilitate smoother operations.  Maintenance liaisons will not be provided by RF Host-MAJCOM or respective CTS Staff.  Countries must utilize USAF  maintenance  liaison  exchange  officers  assigned  in  the  country,  if  available.  Funding for the maintenance liaison will be direct pay by the requesting country. 6.8.3.16.  Any  other  requests.    This  would  include  requests  for  beyond  ―standard‖ support, such as use of USAF aircraft, AWACS controller participation, and requests for participation  by  International  air  defense  units.  Also  include  any  details  on  support requested  under  this  FMS  case  outside  of  the  RF  exercise  itself,  such  as  deployment  to other locations, Mobile Training Team Support, Spin-Up training, etc. 6.9.  IPC/FPC planning and Contract/“Participant Plan.  ” 6.9.1.  RF planning conferences are usually scheduled 90-120 days prior to the RF exercise, are  mandatory  meetings  and  are  an  important  milestone  in  the  planning  process.  International  representatives  attending  the  IPC/FPC  must  come  prepared  to  address  all aspects  of  the  deployment  to  include  operations,  logistics,  intelligence,  munitions, communications  requirements,  and  security  issues.    At  the  end  of  the  IPC/FPC  a contract/participant  plan  will  be  developed  to  document  the  number  of  personnel  to  be deployed, mission types, sortie rates, munitions, and logistics details.  However, much of the preliminary information must be gathered well in advance of the actual IPC/FPC.   24  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 6.9.2.  A  MAJCOM  OPR  representative  will  attend  the  IPC  or  FPC  if  required  to  assist participant countries with FMS case or ACSA items. 6.10.  Foreign Visit Request (FVR) and Entry Authority List (EAL). 6.10.1.  An  approved  FVR  listing  all  foreign  Red  Flag  participants  is  required  before  entry permission to USAF bases and RF facilities can be granted.  This requirement also includes WLOP  and  planning  conference  participants.    The  FVR  must  be  submitted  by  the  country through its embassy in Washington D.C. NLT 30 days prior to any planned arrival date.  RF Host-MAJCOM  Foreign  Disclosure  Office  can  verify  if  authorized  FVRs  are  on  file.    The respective RF Team Chief should be listed as the US POC for purposes of the FVR. 6.10.2.  Foreign Red Flag participants (to include WLOP and planning conference attendees) must also submit required information to the appropriate RF Team Chief to be placed on an approved  EAL.    In  most  cases  FVR  data  can  be  copied  and  transferred  to  satisfy  this requirement.  Required personal details are: 6.10.2.1.  Full Name, Rank, Duty Title 6.10.2.2.  Passport Number, Issuing Country 6.10.2.3.  Date of Birth 6.10.2.4.  Dates of Visit (dates at each base if visiting multiple bases) 6.10.2.5.  Travel Itinerary AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   25  Chapter 7 RF WORKING LEVEL OBSERVER PROGRAM 7.1.  Purpose.  The  WLOP  provides  partner  countries  an  opportunity  to  prepare  their  air  and ground forces for future participation in a RF exercise.  When invited, international participants will send unit level planners to observe a RF exercise.  The WLOP is the first step in the overall building-block approach to developing partner air forces into capable coalition partners.    WLO participation  in  the  USAF’s  premiere  multinational  LFE  exercise--RF-N  and  RF-A  directly contributes to BPC. 7.2.  Objectives.  Ensure Working Level Observers (WLOs) observe a RF exercise NLT one (1) year  prior  to  their  expected  date  of  participation  with  aircraft.    WLOs  should  observe  a  RF exercise  at  the  location  where  they  first  expect  to  fly.    However,  scheduling  conflicts, classification  of  specific  RF  exercises,  and  Theater  Security  Cooperation  (TSC)/Pol-Mil considerations  may  force  the  observation  and  participation  with  aircraft  to  different  locations. WLOP  objectives  are  tailored  to  each  country’s  expected  participation.      International participants are categorized based on their air forces’ level of experience with multinational LFE exercises, a realistic timeline for future aircraft participation, and, for those not sending aircraft, what ground participation role they desire.  The categories and associated objectives are: 7.2.1.  Experienced and bringing aircraft (EXP/FLY):  Experienced with LFE exercises, new to  RF,  and  scheduled  to  bring  aircraft  to  a  RF  exercise  within  the  next  two  (2)  years.  Objectives for these WLOs are: 7.2.1.1.  Gain  a  full  understanding  of  RF-N  and/or  RF-A  by  experiencing  first-hand  the scope  and  complexity  of  the  RF  exercise.    WLOs  should  observe  the  planning  process from beginning to completion, observation should include the IPC for RF-N and the FPC for RF-A.  The following are mandatory events for WLOs to observe during the first days of a RF exercise: 7.2.1.1.1.  In-processing with RF Security. 7.2.1.1.2.  In-brief. 7.2.1.1.3.  Observe mission planning flow. 7.2.1.1.4.  Observe mission brief, live fly and mission debriefs. 7.2.1.1.5.  Tour maintenance facilities. 7.2.1.2.  Answer  planning  questions  covering  deployment,  bed-down,  logistic  support, operations,  maintenance,  administration,  funding  (including  FMS,  ACSA,  direct  bill, etc.),  supply,  munitions,  re-deployment,  and  any  other  questions  related  to  the  location where the country will participate.  WLOs will be expected to answer questions that arise during the WLOP prior to their scheduled RF IPC/FPC. 7.2.1.3.  Lay the foundation for success  at  the participant’s  IPC/FPC.   This  includes an understanding  of  the  number  and  type  aircraft  the  participant  will  be  allowed  to  bring, logistic support they can expect to receive from the US versus what they must provide for themselves,  mission  roles  they  will  be  expected  to  fly  (interdiction,  Close  Air  Support, etc.),  Training  Rules  with  emphasis  on  spin-up  training,  strict  adherence  to  Rules  of   26  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 Engagement, Mission Planning Cell functions, Chain-of-Command and expectations for personal behavior. 7.2.1.4.  Build  relationships  with  potential  future  air  power  leaders  from  the  USAF  and other international participants. 7.2.2.  Not  experienced,  bringing  aircraft  (NON-EXP/FLY):    No  experience  with  LFE exercises, new to RF, and potentially scheduled to bring aircraft to a future RF exercise three (3) or more years from WLOP invite.  The primary reason for extending WLOP invitations to these  partner  countries  is  to  meet  a  broader  TSC/Pol-Mil  engagement  plan  and  begin  the building-block  process  for  developing  their  air  forces  into  successful  RF  participants.  International  partner  air  forces  require  a  thorough  FCA  of  capabilities  and  suitability  to participate  in  RF  exercises  before  an  actual  aircraft  participation  invitation  would  be extended.  The  FCA  must  adhere  to  mandatory  RF  assessment  criteria  as  explained  in chapter 5.  An invitation to the WLOP is NOT A GUARANTEE the country will receive an actual  exercise  participation  invitation.    The  international  participant  must  meet  all  RF Assessment Criteria before an exercise participation invitation will be extended.  Objectives for these WLOs are similar to paragraph 7.2.1, but with a more general focus on the broader understanding of the LFE concept and how RF exercises are conducted.  It is likely these air forces will be invited to send WLOs to more than one exercise as they approach within two years  of  participation.    These  countries  will  have  an  identical  WLOP  agenda  as  the EXP/FLY  countries,  as  explained  in  paragraph  7.2.1    WLOs  in  this  category  will  be initially invited to observe a RF exercise appropriate for ―first time‖ participants. 7.2.3.  Not experienced and not bringing aircraft (NON-EXP/NO FLY):  No experience with LFE exercises, not expected to participate with aircraft at any time in the near future (next 8-10 years) or can only participate in a variety of ground roles.  These countries are invited to send  WLOs  as  a  part  of  a  broader  TSC/Pol-Mil  engagement  plan.  Some  countries  in  this category  may  never  be  invited  to  participate  with  aircraft  in  a  RF  exercise.    They  may  be invited  to  send  only  ground  participants  or  they  may  be  invited  only  as  observers  for  the foreseeable  future.    The  TSC/Pol  Mil  benefits  outweigh  any  potential  impact  observation may  have  on  the  observed  RF  exercise.    For  this  reason,  these  WLOs  will  have  a  tailored agenda and are restricted to observing only ―first time‖ RF exercises.  Objectives are to: 7.2.3.1.  Participate in a manner that will add value to the RF exercise.  Ground observer missions  that  add  value  are  Air  Defense  Teams  (Smokey  SAMs),  Special  Operations insertion forces, PR forces and JTAC Teams. 7.2.3.2.  Gain  appreciation  for  RF  exercises  and  empower  WLOs  to  advocate  to  their senior leadership the benefits of more robust participation. 7.2.3.3.  Build  relationships  with  potential  future  air  power  leaders  from  the  USAF  and other international participants. 7.3.  Target Audience. 7.3.1.  EXP/FLY  and  NON-EXP/FLY  WLOs  should  represent  the  unit  level  leadership (equivalent  to  SQ/CC,  DO  or  ADO)  and  carry  the  authority  to  make  decisions  about  their participating  aircraft  types  and  missions.    Representation  should  include  officers  from  the following functional areas: AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   27  7.3.1.1.  Two (2) Operations representatives 7.3.1.2.  One (1) Maintenance representative 7.3.1.3.  One (1) Logistics Planner or Finance Officer 7.3.2.  NON-EXP/NO  FLY countries should send mission appropriate WLOs in the USAF rank equivalent majors or lieutenant colonels. 7.4.  Limitations. 7.4.1.  Number  of  countries.    SAF/IA  WLOP  invitations  will  be  limited  to  a  maximum  of four primary countries for any RF exercise.  Alternate countries may be identified; however, alternates  will  only  attend  on  a  one-for-one  replacement  primary  countries  decline invitations. 7.4.2.  Number of WLOs per country. 7.4.2.1.  EXP/FLY and NON-EXP/FLY are limited to a maximum of four (4) WLOs per exercise. 7.4.2.2.  NON-EXP/NO FLY are limited to a maximum of three (3) WLOs per exercise. 7.4.3.  Disclosure/Security  Classification.    WLOs  will  only  be  invited  to  observe  RF exercises for which they share the same disclosure/releasable authorization and classification as  defined  in  National  Disclosure  Policy  (NDP)  and  in  the  Multi  Nation  05  (MN-05)  RF Delegation  Disclosure  Letter  (RF  DDL).    Countries  categorized  NON-EXP/NO  FLY  will only  be  invited  to  observe  a  RF  exercise  for  ―First  Time‖  participants.    In  no  case  will  a WLO’s  disclosure  authorization  limit  the  overall  classification  and  disclosure  authorization for that RF exercise. 7.4.3.1.  WLOs will not be invited to observe Ground Control Intercept (GCI) controllers. 7.4.3.2.  WLOs will not be invited to observe the White Force Cell. 7.4.4.  Wednesday of the first week of the RF exercise will be the last day of all WLOPs. 7.4.5.  WLOs  should  not  expect  direct  support  from  CTS  members  during  the  exercise execution.  They are encouraged to ask questions of their US escort officer or write questions down  for  submission  to  be  answered  later.    Office  visits  with  CTS  leadership  are  not encouraged. 7.4.6.  English  Language  Skills.    WLOs  should  be  able  to  read,  speak,  and  understand  the English language sufficiently to effectively communicate with US escort officer and RF staff.  WLOs must pass either an ECL test with a score of 85 or higher or an OPI test with a score of  2/2  or  better  prior  to  participating  as  WLOs.    Waivers  can  be  granted  for  extenuating circumstances, but  should be an exception, not the norm.  Waivers must be initiated by the country and coordinated through the sponsoring/nominating agency.  Waiver approval is the respective CTS/CC. 7.5.  Invitation Process. 7.5.1.  SAF/IA  is  OPR for all RF invitations.  WLO invitations are a byproduct of the RF Board  process  and  will  be  staffed  by  SAF/IAPX  for  SAF/IA  approval  and  signature  along with all other RF exercise invitations.   28  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 7.5.2.  WLOP invitations will include the following details: 7.5.2.1.  Exercise name to observe 7.5.2.2.  Exercise WLO dates: 7.5.2.2.1.  Arrival date for WLOs is the day prior to the initial brief. 7.5.2.2.2.  WLOs must observe the initial briefs. 7.5.2.2.3.  WLOs should observe the first three (3) flying days of the exercise. 7.5.2.2.4.  Depart after the third flying day (mid week) or earlier if required. 7.5.2.3.  Planning conference dates.  WLOs should consider observing the IPC for RF-N and the FPC for RF-A.  WLO attendance at other planning conferences is not required. 7.5.2.4.  Clearly specify the rank/duty title/functional area to meet the requirements of the ―target audience‖ as explained in paragraph 7.3, and limits on the number of WLOs as explained in paragraph 7.4 7.5.2.5.  RF Exercise POC or Team Chief with contact info. 7.5.2.6.  FVR requirements as explained in paragraph 7.8 7.5.2.7.  A note will be included, stating ―an invitation to participate in the WLOP is not a guarantee  that  the  country  will  be  invited  to  participate  with  aircraft  in  a  future  RF exercise.‖ 7.5.2.8.  Respond NLT date that is two (2) months from the date the invitation is expected to be sent to the country, or at a minimum, NLT three (3) months prior to STARTEX for any Out-of-Cycle WLO invitations. 7.5.3.  Invitation  timeline.    WLOP  invitations  should  be  delivered  to  countries  at  the  same time  as  all  other  invitations  (aircraft  participants,  ground  participants)  for  that  RF  exercise.   Alternate  WLOP  invitations  should  be  sent  as  soon  as  primary  countries  decline  their invitations. 7.5.4.  Out-of-cycle WLO invitations are highly discouraged as they occur outside of the RF Board process. 7.5.4.1.  Out-of-Cycle  WLO  invitations  will  be  communicated  to  SAF/IAPX  and coordinated  with  appropriate  RF  Host-MAJCOM  POCs  and  414  CTS/353  CTS  to determine available space and appropriate RF exercise.  If space is limited per paragraph 7.4.1 a waiver must be requested from SAF/IA. 7.5.4.2.  Out-of-cycle  WLO  invitations  will  be  managed  by  SAF/IAPX  and  include  a respond NLT date of three (3) months prior to the RF exercise STARTEX. 7.6.  Agenda. 7.6.1.  A sample RF-N WLOP agenda is at Attachment 7, while Attachment 8 is a sample for  RF-A.    These  should  be  used  as  the  baseline  for  building  WLOP  visit  schedules, appropriately  tailored  for  the  aircraft  and  missions  of  interest.    Certain  events  must  be observed in order to meet the objectives of the WLOP; however, flexibility may be required in  order  to  compensate  for  the  unique  interests,  concerns,  and  issues  that  each  partner  air forces’ WLOs bring to the observation of a RF exercise. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   29  7.6.2.  EXP/FLY  and  NON-EXP/FLY  WLOs  should  be  invited  to  observe  an  appropriate planning  conference  in  order  to  understand  how  a  support  contract  is  constructed  (RF-N  = IPC and RF-A = FPC).  Recommend WLOs follow one of the participating allies through the process.  Observation of RF-A planning conferences is conducted at Eielson AFB, regardless of  where  WLOs  will  observe  the  actual  RF-A  exercise.    Planning  conference  attendance  is not required for NON-EXP/NO FLY WLOs. 7.6.3.  As a general rule WLOs will observe RF-A exercises from the location they are most likely  to  deploy  their  aircraft  (Eielson  AFB  or  Elmendorf  AFB).    In  most  cases  this  means WLOs representing fighter aircraft from their country will observe the exercise from Eielson AFB and WLOs representing airlift aircraft will observe RF-A at Elmendorf AFB.  Ground Participant WLOs (JTAC, Air Defense Team) will observe RF-A exercises at Eielson AFB. 7.6.4.  WLOs will observe the following RF Exercise events during the arrival phase and first three flying days of the exercise: 7.6.4.1.  Deployment and bed-down of forces attending exercise, as available. 7.6.4.2.  In-briefs (Local Area Orientation (LAO), Special Instructions (SPINS), etc.) 7.6.4.3.  Mission  Planning  Cell  (MPC)  process  (initial  coordination  and  final  review meetings). 7.6.4.4.  Mass brief, flight execution observed on YMDS for RF-A or NACTS for RF-N (ACMI/ACTS  live  fly)  and  mass  debrief  for  respective  period  at  least  twice.    Ideally, WLOs will observe both an AM and a PM go, as classification allows.  In no case will a WLO be a limiting factor in the classification of a given RF briefing. 7.6.4.5.  Appropriate  mission  specific  debrief/validation  (A/A  Shot  Val,  A/G  Weapons Val, etc.) based upon the type of mission the WLOs expect their unit to fly in future RF exercises.   Not required for ground only WLOs. 7.6.5.  WLOs  will  meet  with  CTS  staff  and  host  base  agencies  on  a  non-interference  basis.  Areas  to  discuss  include  deployment,  bed-down,  logistic  support,  operations,  maintenance, administration,  funding  (FMS,  ACSA,  direct  bill,  etc.),  supply,  munitions,  re-deployment, and  any  other  questions  they  may  have  related  to  the  location  from  which  they  will participate.  Escort officers will liaison with appropriate staff and host base POCs to facilitate appropriate meetings for the WLOs. 7.6.6.  WLOs  will  be  given  the  current  English  language  test  scoring  requirements  for  the respective RF exercise, per chapter 9.  Either the US escort officer or a representative of the RF staff should explain the standards so there is no misunderstanding as to what is expected of RF participants.  Emphasize the importance of improving English language skills so they can effectively and safely participate in a RF exercise. 7.7.  U.  S. Escort Officer Requirements. 7.7.1.  One  Escort  Officer  per  Country.  Each  set  of  WLOs  will  have  a  dedicated  U.S. Escort Officer assigned to assist them throughout the WLOP. 7.7.2.  Sourcing  and  funding.  The  agency  (MAJCOM,  SAF/IA,  ODC,  etc.)  that  sponsors and/or nominates a country for a WLOP invitation is responsible for providing and funding   30  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 the U.S. Escort Officer.  In no case will the U.S. Escort Officer be tasked from the host wing or the CTS staff. 7.7.3.  AFSC.  U.S.  Escort Officers should have  experience in  the mission set  equivalent  to the WLOs they will escort and it is preferred that they have experience in similar aircraft as available. 7.7.4.  Role.  The role of the U.S. Escort Officer is to facilitate WLO integration into the RF exercise and act as liaison between WLOs and the RF White Force Staff and/or any host base agencies.  Included in this role is the need for the Escort Officer to assist with admin issues (lodging,  transportation,  AAFES/Commissary  access,  etc.)  in  order  to  make  the  WLO  visit smooth and successful.  Escort Officers will make every reasonable effort to facilitate WLOs participation IAW WLOP Agenda as explained in paragraph 7.6. 7.8.  Funding. 7.8.1.  WLO visits are funded by the parent country, unless US funding is approved pursuant to applicable legal authority (e.g., 10 U.S.C. 2010, Participation of Developing Countries in Combined  Exercises.).    Sponsoring  C-MAJCOM/C-NAF  is  responsible  for  identifying countries eligible to receive US Title 10 funding and securing such funds for the WLOs. 7.8.2.  Escort officer Funding.  The agency that sponsors or nominates a country for WLOP participation is responsible for funding and sourcing the US escort officer IAW  paragraph 7.4.3.2 7.9.  FVR and EAL Requirement.  WLOs must be listed on an approved FVR and EAL before entry permission to USAF bases and RF facilities can be granted.  Details of this requirement are in paragraph 6.10 AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   31  Chapter 8 RF INTERNATIONAL GROUND PARTICIPANTS 8.1.  Authorized Mission Types.  The following types of ground participants will be considered for RF exercises: 8.1.1.  JTAC 8.1.1.1.  Participating  country  must  be  signatory  to  JCAS  Action  Plan  Memorandum  of Agreement 2004-1, Joint Terminal Attack Controller (Ground), NATO STANAG 3797, Air Interdiction and Close Air Support or similar governing agreement recognized by the USAF. 8.1.1.2.  All JTAC operations will be conducted IAW Joint Publication 3-09.3 Close Air Support. 8.1.1.3.  JTAC  personnel  can  meet  the  qualification  requirements  of  either  the  JCAS Action  Plan  Memorandum  of  Agreement  2004-1  or  the  NATO  STANAG  3797.  However, all foreign JTAC team members must be mission ready and are subject to the same  currency  requirements  as  US  JTAC  personnel  IAW  the  JCAS  Action  Plan Memorandum of Agreement 2004-1. 8.1.2.  Special Operations (SPECOPS) 8.1.3.  Air Defense Teams (STINGER, MANPAD, etc.) 8.1.4.  CAOC (RF-N only) 8.1.5.  GCI Controllers are permitted at RF-A only, subject to additional security restrictions. 8.2.  RF-N  does not  allow ground participants  unless the country is  sending aircraft to  support ground operations. 8.3.  RF-A    authorizes  international  participants  to  send  ground  participants  regardless  of aircraft participation. 8.4.  White  Cell.  International  participants  or  WLOs  are  not  allowed  within  White  Cell operations at any RF exercise.

Participants  not  achieving  qualifying  ECL  scores  can  be  retested  30  days  after  the initial test administration.  Waivers to the 30 day waiting period can be requested from Chief, Test and Measurement Branch, DLIELC. 9.1.2.  ECL testing allows for a maximum of two (2) tests taken per individual (one primary test and then a maximum of one (1) retest). 9.2.  Oral  Proficiency  Interview  Testing  Policy.  All  OPI  testing  will  be  IAW  DLIELC Instruction 1025.9. 9.2.1.  Each international participant must have a current ECL score before being scheduled for an OPI test. 9.2.2.  OPI testing is limited to a maximum of one (1) test taken per individual with no retest options. 9.3.  RF  English  Language  Proficiency  Requirements.  For  flying  events  conducted  in  a highly  dynamic  environment,  such  as  RF-A  and  RF-N,  the  ECL  and  OPI  requirements  are addressed by position (flight and ground participants) in table  9.1  OPI scores are listed as two numbers  representing  listening/speaking  skills  respectively.

Failure to meet this requirement makes the individual ineligible for participation in a RF exercise. 9.4.  ECL and OPI Test Window.  Tests must begin No Earlier Than (NET) 105 days prior to the international participant’s arrival at USAF base for an RF exercise.  Tests must be completed NLT 30 days prior to arrival. 9.5.  In-Country  US  Country  Team  Support.  Country  teams  are  required  to  administer (proctor) ECL/OPI testing for their respective country’s international participants. Therefore, it is imperative  the  country  teams  are  informed  of  the  English  language  testing  requirements, including  the  specific  RF  exercise’s  testing  window,  at  the  earliest  opportunity.    SAF/IAR Country  Director  is  responsible  for  country  teams’  notification  of  the  RF  board  results  and planning considerations, as noted in paragraph 2.3.4.2 9.5.1.  Country team will coordinate ECL and OPI testing directly with DLIELC as soon as their country accepts the RF Invitation and IAW DLIELC procedures. 9.5.2.  Country  team  will  work  with  country’s  POC  to  determine  the  expected  number  of Mission and Package Commanders that will be required to  take the OPI  test.   As a general rule,  countries  should  not  expect  to  get  more  than  four  Mission  and  four  Package Commander slots per RF exercise. 9.6.  OPI  Logistics.  OPI  testing  is  logistically  demanding  and  requires  greater  support  from country  teams  as  compared  to  the  ECL  test.    The  Country  Team  must  be  notified  of  the  OPI requirements  and individuals  (Mission  Commander/Package Commanders) well in advance of the test window to ensure proper manning of proctors for the tests. the  expected  number  of   34  AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010 Chapter 10 PRE AND/OR POST-RF EXERCISE TRAINING IN CONUS AND ALASKA 10.1.  Purpose.  The  following  guidance  establishes  staff  procedures  when  international participants desire to conduct unit level training before or after participation in a RF exercise in CONUS or Alaska.  The procedures outlined in this chapter apply when requested support is not already identified in an existing FMS case or other arrangement in accordance with law. 10.2.  Policy Goals. 10.2.1.  Ensure early and formal staffing of requests. 10.2.1.1.  Timely  responses  to  international  participants--goal  is  a  positive/negative response NLT 30 days from date of request. (i.e. 10.2.1.2.  Timely/accurate MAJCOMs/units,  AFSAC,  AFSAT)  to  support  the  international  participant’s  request  if approved. affected  USAF  organizations information to 10.2.2.  Ensure  requests  for  the  use  of  USAF  support  are  staffed  with  the  proper considerations. 10.2.2.1.  Overall benefit is achieved at minimal risk to USAF and USG.

Typical  requests  made  by  international  participants  in  conjunction  with  RF  are  for USAF support of air-to-air training versus USAF or other  foreign air  forces,  use of  USAF operated air-to-ground ranges or access to US special use airspace.  Other request scenarios are possible. 10.3.2.  General Staffing Procedures. 10.3.2.1.  A formal LOR must be submitted, normally from the appropriate country team agency  to  the  SAF/IA  Country  Director,  NLT  12  months  prior to  proposed  deployment date.  This LOR is separate from and in addition to their RF LOR. 10.3.2.2.  Requests will include information in the format similar to that of the RF FMS case LOR shown in Attachment 6, although additional clarification may be required for proper  evaluation.    SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  will  ensure  this  attachment  is  made available to appropriate international POCs and completed prior to forwarding. AIR FORCE INSTRUCTION16-115  19 JUNE 2010   35  10.3.2.3.  SAF/IAR  Country  Directors  will  coordinate  requests  with  SAF/IAPX,  IAPD, IARW,  GCI,  AFSAC/AFSAT  and  the  RF  Host-MAJCOM  POCs.  SAF/IAR  Country Directors  will  work  with  RF  Host-MAJCOM  POCs  to  determine  suitable  training location. 10.3.2.4.  RF  Host-MAJCOM  POCs  will  coordinate  with  host  wing(s)  to  determine  if operations  at  the  base  are  supportable.    USAF  host  MAJCOMs/units  will  determine impact on USAF operations/priorities. 10.3.3.  After  proper  coordination,  the  SAF/IAR  Country  Director  drafts  and  coordinates  a formal  response  to  the  LOR,  to  include  a  summary  of  any  appropriate  procedures, restrictions, or implementation/conclusion of relevant documentation. training,  FMS development timelines for unit level case 10.4.

This document does not request a change to the keying material requesting process, but is  a  reemphasis  of  standing  Joint  COMSEC  Management  Office  (JCMO)  procedures (http://kt.jfcom.smil.mil/jcmo/homepage.nsf). A10.2.  The  international  participant’s  unit  or  base  COMSEC  custodian  is  the  POC  for  all questions regarding KEYMAT issue and distribution. A10.3.  The RF CTS  COMSEC  custodian and the CAOC-Nellis  COMSEC  custodian will send an ―Intent to Use/COMSEC Call Out‖ message to all RF participants’ COMSEC custodians NLT 60 days from the RF ADVON arrival date.  The call out message will inform all participants of what KEYMAT, short titles, will be required to operate during the RF Exercise. A10.4.  International  participants  will  inventory  and  confirm  whether  or  not  they  hold  the specific  KEYMAT  outlined  in  the  COMSEC  Call  Out  message.    If  they  hold  the  specific KEYMAT,  then  no  further  steps  are  required.    If  an  international  participant  does  not  hold  the required KEYMAT, then: A10.4.1.  The  participant’s  COMSEC  custodian  will  send  a  request  for  the  required KEYMAT to their appropriate US Combatant Command.  For example, the French Air Force will request through EUCOM. A10.4.2.  Items required on the request are: A10.4.2.1.  COMSEC account number A10.4.2.2.  Short title A10.4.2.3.  Quantity on hand (current quantity) A10.4.2.4.  Quantity to increase/decrease (requested ruantity) A10.4.2.5.  New level (total quantity to be held if approved) A10.4.2.6.  When the KEYMAT is needed A10.4.2.7.  Justification for KEYMAT A10.4.2.8.  Authority for justification A10.4.3.  The COCOM will have two work days to validate the foreign unit’s request. Once the  COCOM  validates  the  request,  the  request  is  forwarded  to  the  KEYMAT’s  control authority.   If deemed invalid then COCOM will return the verdict  to  the requesting foreign unit. A10.4.4.  The  KEYMAT  control  authority  has  two  work  days  to  validate  the  COCOM request.   The control authority will forward the validation to the National Security Agency (NSA).  If deemed invalid then the control authority will return the verdict to the COCOM. A10.4.5.  The  NSA  places  the  international  participant  unit’s  COMSEC  account  on  the distribution list, and coordinates through the COCOM to  arrange the KEYMAT delivery to the requesting organization.
