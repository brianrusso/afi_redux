Although there is not an official government definition of privacy, it generally refers to the notion of individuals maintaining control over information about them.  For the Air Force, the framework of privacy requirements includes the Privacy Act of 1974, the E-Government Act of 2002 (specifically section 208), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) policy, DoD policy, and Air Force policy. Failure to protect privacy can bring about risks to the individual, such as identity theft and risks to the Air Force, such as lawsuits for inappropriate disclosure that divert critical resources away from our mission. 1.1.2.  What  information  must  be  protected?  The  information  protected  by  the  various components of the privacy framework is discussed using multiple terms.  For the purposes of this Instruction, there are two key definitions to understand: 1.1.2.1.  Personal Information (Personally Identifiable Information (PII)) 1.1.2.1.1.  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  Memorandum  07-16,  Safeguarding Against and Responding to PII Breach - Personally Identifiable Information is defined as information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc. 1.1.2.1.2.  Office of Management and Budget Memorandum10-22, Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies - The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology.  Rather, it demands a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified.  In performing this assessment,  it  is  important  for  an  agency  to  recognize  that  non-PII  can  become  PII whenever additional information is made publicly available – in any medium and from any source – that, when combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual. 1.1.2.2.  For  safeguarding  of  Personal  Information,  please  refer  to  DoD  5400.11-R, Department of Defense Privacy Program (C1.4, C4 and Appendix 1). 1.1.2.2.1.  DELETED 1.1.2.2.1.1.

Use  is  mandatory  to  protect  PII  from  being  viewed  by  unauthorized personnel when Privacy Act materials are removed from their system of record or approved storage location. (T-0) 1.1.4.  Label: AFVA 33-276, Air ForceictectPrivacy Act Label. Use is mandatory to assist in identifying Privacy Act information by placing the label on the covers of removable electronic storage  media  such  as  Laptops,  Government  Hard  drives,  DVDs,  CDs,  diskettes,  tapes  and may be used for deployment folders. The label is not authorized for use on file drawers file cabinets, mailing envelopes, or other stationary equipment or materials IAW with AFI 33-322, Records Management Program. (T-1) 1.2.  Privacy Act Notices.  (T-0) 1.2.1.  Whenever an individual is requested to provide personal information that will not be maintained in a SOR, the individual shall be provided the authority, purpose, routine use(s), whether  disclosure  of  the  information  is  voluntary  or  not.    This  is  known  as  a  “Privacy Statement.” (T-0) 1.2.1.1.  Authority:    the  legal  authority  that  authorizes  the  solicitation  of  the  personal information. 1.2.1.2.  Purpose:  the principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used. 1.2.1.3.  Routine Uses:  who or what agency will the personal information be shared with on a routine basis outside the DoD. 1.2.1.4.  Disclosure:  Voluntary or Mandatory.  (Use mandatory only when disclosure is required by law and the individual will be penalized for not providing information.  All mandatory disclosure requirements must first be reviewed by the servicing legal office).  Include any consequences of nondisclosure in nonthreatening language. 1.3.  Privacy Act Information. 1.3.1.  Privacy  Act  Information  is  PII  which  is  referred  to  as  personal  information  that  is maintained in  a System  of Records (SOR)  as defined by the Privacy Act, which means the information  is  retrievable  by  the  name  of  the  individual  or  by  some  identifying  number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual. 1.3.2.  Understanding Which Definition Applies.  PII is a very broad definition and generally refers to any type of personal information that is linked or linkable to a person.  PII may or may  not  be  maintained  in  a  SOR,  which  means  it  may  or  may  not  also  be  Privacy  Act Information.  When PII is maintained in a SOR, it is also Privacy Act Information.  Both the Privacy  Act  requirements  and  other  privacy  requirements  that  protect  PII  in  the  privacy framework  apply  to  Privacy  Act  Information.    When  PII  is  not  maintained  in  a  SOR,  and therefore is not Privacy Act Information, the E-Government Act and many OMB, DoD, and AF policies that protect PII still apply to the information.  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 11 Chapter 2 PRIVACY ACT 2.1.  Overview of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.  S.C. § 552a. 2.1.1.  Under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a, The Congress finds the following: 2.1.1.1.  The privacy of an individual is directly affected by the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information by Federal agencies; 2.1.1.2.  The increasing use of computers and sophisticated information technology, while essential to the efficient operations of the Government, has greatly magnified the harm to individual privacy that can occur from any collection, maintenance, use, or dissemination of personal information; 2.1.1.3.  The opportunities for an individual to secure employment, insurance, and credit, and his/her right to due process, and other legal protections are endangered by the misuse of certain information systems; 2.1.1.4.  The  right  to  privacy  is  a  personal  and  fundamental  right  protected  by  the Constitution of the United States; and 2.1.1.5.  In  order  to  protect  the  privacy  of  individuals  identified  in  information  systems maintained by Federal agencies, it is necessary and proper for the Congress to regulate the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information by such agencies. 2.1.2.  The purpose of the Privacy Act is to provide certain safeguards for an individual against an invasion of personal privacy by requiring Federal agencies, except as otherwise provided by law, to: 2.1.2.1.  Permit an individual to determine what records pertaining to him/her are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by such agencies; 2.1.2.2.  Permit  an  individual  to  prevent  records  pertaining  to  him/her  obtained  by  such agencies for a particular purpose from being used or made available for another purpose without his/her consent; 2.1.2.3.  Permit an individual to gain access to information pertaining to him/her in Federal agency records, to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof, and to correct or amend such records; 2.1.2.4.  Collect,  maintain,  use,  or  disseminate  any  record  of  identifiable  personal information in a manner that assures that such action is for a necessary and lawful purpose, that  the  information  is  current  for  its  intended  use,  and  that  adequate  safeguards  are provided to prevent misuse of such information; 2.1.2.5.  Permit exemptions from the requirements with respect to records provided in this Act only in those cases where there is an important public policy need for such exemption as has been determined by specific statutory authority; and 2.1.2.6.  Criminal Penalties 2.1.2.6.1.  Any officer or employee of an agency, who by virtue of his employment or official  position,  has  possession  of,  or  access  to,  agency  records  which  contain  12 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 individually  identifiable  information  the  disclosure  of  which  is  prohibited  by  this section  or  by  rules  or  regulations  established  thereunder,  and  who  knowing  that disclosure of the specific material is so prohibited, willfully discloses the material in any  manner  to  any  person  or  agency  not  entitled  to  receive  it,  shall  be  guilty  of  a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000. 2.1.2.6.2.  Any officer or employee of any agency who willfully maintains a system of records without meeting the notice requirements shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined not more than $5,000. 2.1.2.6.3.

AF  SORN(s),  are  searchable  by  number  and  title,  and  are  available  at:  http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx (If applicable) 2.5.2.  Privacy  Act  Advisory  Statements  in  Publications.  Include  a  Privacy  Act  Advisory Statement in each AF publication that requires collecting or keeping personal information in a SOR. Also include a statement when publications direct collection from the individual of any part  or  form  of  the  Social  Security  Number  (SSN).  The  statement  shall  refer  to  the  legal authority  for  collecting  the  information  and  SORN  number  and  title  as  follows:  “This Instruction requires the collection and or maintenance of information protected by the Privacy Act of 1974 authorized by [set forth the legal authority such as the federal statute, executive order,  and  regulation].  The  applicable  SORN(s)  [number  and  title]  is  (are)  available  at: http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx 2.5.3.  Paper or electronic documents and/or materials that contain personal information such as a recall rosters, personnel rosters, lists or spreadsheets shall be marked “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” (see DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4, DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)) as follows: 2.5.3.1.  “The  information  herein  is  FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY  (FOUO)  information which must be protected under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C 552) and/or the Privacy  Act  of  1974  (5  U.S.C.  552a).  Unauthorized  disclosure  or  misuse  of  this PERSONAL  INFORMATION  may  result  in  disciplinary  action,  criminal  and/or  civil penalties.” 2.5.4.  All paper documents and printed materials that contain personal information shall be covered with the AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet or DD Form 2923, Privacy Act Data Cover Sheet when removed from its approved storage area. 2.5.5.  The  Privacy  Act  requires  agencies  to  provide  safeguards  to  ensure  the  security  and confidentiality of SOR and to protect individuals against an invasion of personal privacy. 2.5.6.  Exercise  caution  before  transmitting  personal  information  via  e-mail  to  ensure  the message is adequately safeguarded. Some information may be so sensitive and personal that e-mail may not be the appropriate means of transmitting. (see DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, ECCT-1 (Encryption for Confidentiality (Data at Transmit)). 2.5.7.  When transmitting personal information over e-mail, encrypt and add “For Official Use Only” (“FOUO”) to the beginning of the subject line and apply the following statement at the beginning  of  the  e-mail:  "This  e-mail  contains  FOR  OFFICIAL  USE  ONLY  (FOUO) information  which  must be  protected  under  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (5  U.S.C  552) and/or the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a).  Unauthorized disclosure or misuse of this  18 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 PERSONAL  INFORMATION  may  result  in  disciplinary  action,  criminal  and/or  civil penalties. Further distribution is prohibited without the approval of the author of this message unless  the  recipient  has  a  need-to-know  in  the  performance  of  official  duties.  If  you  have received this message in error, please notify the sender and delete all copies of this message.” (Note: Do not indiscriminately apply this statement to all e-mails. Use it only in situations when you are actually transmitting personal information required to be protected For Official Use Only purposes. (see DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)) . The guidance in this paragraph does not apply to appropriate releases of personal information to members of the public via e-mail, such as pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or with the consent of the subject of the personal information.) 2.6.  Publishing System of Records Notices (SORNs).  Records that are retrieved by a personal and/or a unique identifier are subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 requirements and are referred to as a system of records (SOR). The AF Privacy Officer will submit SORNs to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office (DPCLO) to be published in the Federal Register for new, changed or deleted SOR. When published, the public will be allowed 30 days to comment. Collection of this information is not authorized until the SORN is final, including during this 30 day review period. If comments are received that result in a contrary determination, this could further delay the time until  a  final  SORN  is  published  and  collection  may  occur.  Any  collection  conducted  prior  to finalizing the SORN is an illegal collection and can result in civil penalties under the Privacy Act Of 1974 5 U.S.C. § 552a as amended, (i)(1) Criminal Penalties. 2.6.1.  When  is  a  SORN  required?  A  SORN  is  required  when  personal  information  is maintained on an individual and is regularly retrieved by a name, number, symbol, or other identifying  particular  (i.e.  data)  assigned  to  the  individual.  The  Privacy  Act  requires submission of new or significantly changed SORNs to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and both houses of Congress before publication in the Federal Register. This applies when: 2.6.1.1.  Starting a new system. (Add). 2.6.1.1.1.  Preamble. 2.6.1.1.2.  Narrative. 2.6.1.1.3.  Final SORN write up. 2.6.1.2.  Instituting significant changes to an existing system. (Alter). 2.6.1.2.1.  Preamble. 2.6.1.2.2.  Narrative. 2.6.1.2.3.  Changes. 2.6.1.2.4.  Final write-up with changes. 2.6.1.3.  Minor changes to an existing system. (Admin). 2.6.1.3.1.  Changes. 2.6.1.3.2.  Final write-up with changes.  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 19 2.6.2.  Other Systems.  National Security SORs require a SORN. While some or many of these systems may be classified, the SORN is written in an unclassified manner describing the nature of the collection of PII. (see DoD 5400.11-R, for the use and establishment of exemptions that may apply to these systems). 2.6.3.  Adopting Existing SORN.  A new or existing SOR may be incorporated into an existing SORN published in the Federal Register: 2.6.3.1.  First,  research  current  SORNs,  including  those  that  cover  systems  of  records government-wide  and  DoD-wide  on the  Defense  Privacy  Notices  website  at http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx  for  one  that  matches  well  with  the  new SOR at all points, i.e., Category of Individuals Covered, Category of Records, Authority, Purposes, Routine Uses, Policies, etc. 2.6.3.2.  Second,  if  necessary,  contact  the  current  SORN  owner  through  the  POC information on the SORN to discuss altering or amending their SORN to include the new AF SOR and POC information. 2.6.3.3.  Provide  the  system  owner  the  altered  or  amended  SORN  for  their  review  and processing. 2.6.4.  Updating SORNs.  Examples for Adding, Altering, Amending, and Deleting a SORN are available on the AF Information Access SharePoint and the AF Privacy Website. 2.6.5.  Submitting SORNs for Publication in  the Federal  Register. The PM must submit  the proposed SORN through their MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Manager at a minimum of 120 days before the planned implementation date of a new SOR or a change to an existing SOR subject to this Instruction.  The Privacy Manager shall review for accuracy and completeness and  send  electronically  to  the  AF  Privacy  Office  usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.af-privacy@mail.mil.  The AF Privacy Office shall review and forward to DPCLO for review and publishing in the Federal Register, as appropriate. (T-1) 2.6.6.  Requirement for periodic review of published SORNs. PMs use the Air Force Biennial SORN  Accuracy  Review  Checklist  (Attachment  13)  to  document  the  validity,  accuracy, relevance, timeliness and necessity of their published SORNs, coinciding with Appendix I to OMB  Circular  A-130,  (Federal  Agency  Responsibilities  for  Maintaining  Records  about Individuals).  PMs review and submit any changes through the process described in this chapter and promptly update appropriate answers to EITDR questions. 2.6.7.  Deletion  of SORNs.  If  your  IT system  is  being decommissioned or closed and has a published  SORN  that  is  no  longer  required,  comply  with  DoD  5400.11-R,  Department  of Defense Privacy Program, subpar C6.5.3., Deletion of System of Records Notices and submit appropriate amendment or deletion request to the AF Privacy Office, usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.af-privacy@mail.mil to be forwarded to DPCLO to have the SORN deleted from the Federal Register. 2.7.  Privacy  Act  Records  Request.  Persons  or  their  designated  representatives  may  ask  for  a copy of their records maintained in a SOR. Requesters need not state why they want access to their records.  Personnel  that  receive  requests  must  verify  the  identity  of  the  requester  to  avoid unauthorized  disclosures.  How  their  identity  is  verified  will  depend  on  the  sensitivity  of  the requested  records.  Identity  can  be  verified  in  a  number  of  ways,  to  include  visually,  personal  20 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 knowledge of the requester, a signed letter, or a request via telephone as appropriate or e-mail, a notarized  statement,  or  an  unsworn  statement.    An  unsworn  declaration  or  notarized  statement should be obtained in the following format: 2.7.1.  Requesting Access to Records in a SOR. 2.7.1.1.  Contents  of  Request.  “I  declare  under  penalty  of  perjury  (if  outside  the  United States, add “under the laws of the United States of America”) that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on (date)(Signature).” 2.7.1.1.1.  Description of Records. The requester must adequately describe the records they want.  The requester is not required to name a SOR, but they should at least name a type of record or functional area. For requests that ask for “all records about me,” the requester  should  be  asked  for  more  information  about  the  types  of  records  they  are seeking  and  informed  as  to  how  their  input  can  help  the  AF  respond  as  quickly  as possible. If the requester needs help identifying types of systems or records, provide them information to review the government-wide systems of records published in the at Federal http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx.  Ensure that identifying  the  relevant  SORN(s)  will  make  the  AF  review  more  efficient.  If  the requester  is  truly  requesting  all  records  pertaining  to  themselves  or  an  individual, inform the requester they must make a FOIA request. published they  understand Register specific SORNs and AF 2.7.1.1.2.  Provide Verification of Identity. 2.7.1.2.  Use of a Government Resource to Make a Request is prohibited. 2.7.2.  Processing a Request for Access to Records in a SOR. Immediately consult the local Privacy  Manager,  if  necessary,  to  ensure  timely  response  to  the  request.  When  individuals request information about themselves, they are not required to cite either the Privacy Act or Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The individual who processes the request will apply the Privacy Act when records are contained in a SOR and will apply the FOIA to all other records. 2.7.2.1.  Acknowledge Request. As a good practice SOR owner should send the requester an  acknowledgement  letter  within  10  workdays  informing  them  of  an  approximate completion date. 2.7.2.2.  Required Response. As a good practice SOR owner should provide a copy of the record(s) to the requester within 20 workdays of receiving the request. If the SOR has an exemption,  inform  the  requestor  of  those  exemptions  in  a  format  the  requester  can understand.    If  the  system  is  exempt  from  disclosure  under  the  Privacy  Act,  follow  the procedures addressed in paragraph 2.11. 2.7.3.  Denying or Limiting Access. When information protected under the Privacy Act may not be released under the Privacy Act, the request must be processed under the FOIA.  If any part of the record is denied under the FOIA, the procedures in DoD 5400.7-R_AFMAN 33-302,  Freedom  of  Information  Act  Program,  are  followed.    For  Privacy  Act  denials  also processed under the FOIA (Note: This should be an extremely rare circumstance), send a copy of  the  request,  the  record  copy,  and  why  access  has  been  denied  (include  the  applicable exemption)  to  the  denial  authority  through  the  legal  office  and  the  Privacy  Office.  Judge Advocate (JA) office shall include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion shall not merely  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 21 state that the decision is “legally sufficient,” but shall provide factual details and an analysis of  the  law  and  applicable  regulations.  The  Privacy  Manager  reviews  the  file,  and  makes  a recommendation to the denial authority. The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the  decision.  If  the  denial  authority  grants  access,  release  the  record  copy.    If  the  denial authority refuses access, tell the requester why and explain pertinent appeal rights. 2.7.3.1.  Before a request for access to a Privacy Act system of record from the subject is denied that was not processed under the FOIA, the SOR owner shall ensure that: 2.7.3.1.1.  The system  has an exemption  published in  the Federal  Register as a final rule. 2.7.3.1.2.  The  exemption  covers  each  document.  All  parts  of  a  system  are  not automatically exempt. 2.7.3.1.3.  The FOIA does not require release of any part of the record. 2.7.3.1.4.  Nonexempt parts are segregated. 2.7.4.  Third  Party  Information  in  a  SOR.  A  first  party  requester  is  not  entitled  to  receive information that does not directly pertain to him or her that is contained in their record; for example, the home address or SSN of a third party that is contained in their system of record solely for ease of identification of the third party. Servicing legal offices should be consulted prior to the release of a third party’s sensitive personal information to a first party requester that is contained in the first party requester’s SOR. 2.8.  Amending a Privacy Act Record. 2.8.1.  Amendment Reasons. Individuals may ask to have their personal information in a SOR amended to make such information accurate, timely, relevant, and complete. System managers shall routinely correct a record if the requester can show that it is factually incorrect (e.g., date of birth is wrong). 2.8.2.  Responding to Amendment Requests. 2.8.2.1.  The individual may request simple corrections orally. Requests for complicated and detailed corrections must be in writing to ensure clarity. 2.8.2.2.  After verifying the identity of the requester, the receiving agency shall make the change if appropriate, notify all known recipients of the record, and inform the affected individual. 2.8.2.3.  Acknowledge  requests  within  10  workdays  of  receipt.  Give  an  expected completion  date  unless  the  change  is  completed  within  that  time.  Final  decisions  must, unless extended by the appropriate authority, take no longer than 30 workdays after the date of receipt. 2.9.  Approving or Denying a Record to be Amended.  The AF does not usually amend a record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment. Determination not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and the requester may: 2.9.1.  If the SOR owner decides not to amend the record then a copy of the request, the record, and the recommended denial reasons shall be sent to their legal and the Privacy Office. Legal office shall include a written legal opinion. The legal opinion shall not merely state that the  22 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 decision is “legally sufficient,” but will provide factual details and an analysis of the law and applicable regulations. 2.9.2.  The SOR owner shall send the requester a letter with the decision. 2.9.3.  If  the  SOR  owner  denies  to  amend  the  records,  the  requester  may  file  a  concise statement of disagreement with the Air Force Privacy Officer. 2.10.  Contents of Privacy Act Processing Case Files.  Copies of disputed records shall not be kept in Privacy Act Processing Case files. Disputed records shall be filed under their appropriate series. Use the Privacy Act Processing Case Files solely for statistics and to process requests.  Such case files shall not be used to make any kind of determination about an individual.  The reasons for untimely responses shall be documented in  the Privacy  Act  Processing Case  Files and may include the following: 2.10.1.  Requests  from  and  replies  to  individuals  on  whether  a  SOR  contains  records  about them. 2.10.2.  Requests for access or amendment. 2.10.3.  Approvals, denials, appeals, and final review actions. 2.11.  First  Party  Appeal  Process  For  Denial  to  Access  or  Amendment  of  a  Privacy  Act Record. 2.11.1.  Appeals Procedures. Individuals who receive a denial to their access or amendment request may request a denial review (appeal) within 60 calendar days of the date of the denial letter. 2.11.2.  The  SOR  owner  shall  promptly  send  a  complete  appeal  package  to  the  Air  Force Privacy Officer. The package must include the following: (T-0) 2.11.2.1.  The original appeal letter; 2.11.2.2.  The initial request; 2.11.2.3.  The initial denial; 2.11.2.4.  A copy of the record; 2.11.2.5.  Any internal records or coordination actions relating to the denial and the denial authority’s comments on the appellant’s arguments and the legal reviews. 2.11.3.  If  the  SOR  owner  reverses  their  decision  on  an  earlier  denial  and  grants  access  or amendment, notify the requester immediately. 2.11.4.  The  SOR  owner  may  include  a  brief  summary  of  the  reasons  for  not  amending  the record. 2.11.5.  The  Air  Force  Privacy  Officer  will  review  the  denial  and  provide  a  final recommendation  to  the  SOR  owner  along  with  providing  the  requester  with  the  final  AF decision and explanation of judicial review rights. 2.11.6.  The records will clearly show that a statement of disagreement is filed with the record or separately, if applicable.  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 23 2.11.7.  The  disputed  part  of  the  record  must  show  that  the  requester  filed  a  statement  of disagreement. 2.11.8.  Give  copies  of  the  statement  of  disagreement  to  the  record’s  previous  recipients. Inform subsequent record users about the dispute and give them a copy of the statement with the record. 2.12.  Disclosing Information. 2.12.1.  In  all  cases,  use  the  following  guidelines  to  decide  whether  to  release  information without consent: 2.12.1.1.  Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information requested? 2.12.1.2.  Is disclosing the information in the public interest? The public interest relates to how the AF carries out its statutory and regulatory duties. 2.12.1.3.  Balance  the  public  interest  against  the  individual’s  privacy  interest.  Do  not consider the requester’s purpose, circumstances, or proposed use. 2.12.2.  Rules for Releasing personal information without Consent of the Subject. The Privacy Act prohibits disclosure of personal information within a SOR without the prior written consent of  the  individual  to  whom  the  record  pertains.    There  are  twelve  exceptions  to  the  “no disclosure without consent” rule. (see http://www.privacy.af.mil/exceptions/index.asp) 2.12.3.  Disclosing the  Medical  Records of Minors. AF personnel  may disclose the medical records of minors to  their parents  or legal  guardians in  conjunction  with applicable Federal laws and guidelines. The laws of each state define the age of majority and/or circumstances under  which  minors  are  consider  emancipated.  Consult  with  the  servicing  legal  office’s medical  liaison  and Military Treatment  Facility  (MTF) for  guidance in  regard to  the age of majority, especially in overseas locations. 2.12.4.  Disclosure  Accountings.  System  managers  must  keep  an  accurate  record  of  all disclosures made from any SOR except disclosures to DoD personnel for a valid official use or  disclosures  under  the  FOIA.  System  managers  may  use  AF  Form  771,  Accounting  of Disclosures. Retain disclosure accountings for 5 years after the disclosure, or for the life of the record, whichever is longer. 2.12.4.1.  System managers shall file the Accounting of Disclosure record and give it to the  data  subject  on  request,  send  corrected  or  disputed  information  to  previous  record recipients, explain any disclosures, and provide an audit trail for reviews. Include in each accounting: (T-0) 2.12.4.1.1.  Release date. 2.12.4.1.2.  Description of information. 2.12.4.1.3.  Reason for release. 2.12.4.1.4.  Name and address of recipient. 2.12.4.1.5.  Some  exempt  systems  let  you  withhold  the  accounting  record  from  the subject.  24 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 2.12.4.1.6.  Withhold  information  about  disclosure  accountings  for  law  enforcement purposes at the law enforcement agency’s request. 2.13.  Computer Matching.  Computer matching programs electronically compare records from two or more automated systems, one from the DoD and the other from a Federal agency, or a state or local government in other to make a decision that affects an individual’s rights, benefits and/or privileges. 2.13.1.  A system manager proposing a match that could result in an adverse action against a Federal employee must meet the following requirements of the Privacy Act: 2.13.1.1.  Prepare a written agreement between participants; 2.13.1.2.  Secure approval of the Defense Data Integrity Board; 2.13.1.3.  Publish a matching notice in the Federal Register before matching begins; 2.13.1.4.  Ensure full investigation and due process; and 2.13.1.5.  Act on the information, as necessary. 2.13.2.  The Privacy Act applies to matching programs that use records from Federal personnel or payroll systems and Federal benefit programs where matching: 2.13.2.1.  Determines Federal benefit eligibility; 2.13.2.2.  Checks on compliance with benefit program requirements; or 2.13.2.3.  Recovers  improper  payments  or  delinquent  debts  from  current  or  former beneficiaries. 2.13.3.  Matches  used  for  statistics,  pilot  programs,  law  enforcement,  tax  administration, routine  administration,  background  checks  and  foreign  counterintelligence,  and  internal matching  that  will  not  cause  any  adverse  action  are  exempt  from  Privacy  Act  matching requirements. 2.13.4.  Any activity that  expects  to  participate in a matching program  must  contact  the AF Privacy Officer immediately. System managers  must prepare a Computer System Matching Agreement notice for publication in the Federal Register, which explains the routine uses that permit the processing of personal information to the AF Privacy Officer. Allow 180 days for processing requests for a new matching program. 2.13.5.  Individuals must receive notice when they are asked to provide personal information that  will  be  used  in  a  matching  program  as  a  routine  use.  The  most  appropriate  method  of providing notice is to include the PAS on the form used when an individual applies for benefits. When the individual completes and submits the form and has been provided adequate notice, they  are  consenting  to  the  routine  uses  associated  with  the  notice.  Coordinate  appropriate statements with the MAJCOM/FOA/DRU Privacy Manager and AF Privacy Officer. 2.14.  Privacy Act Exemptions. 2.14.1.  Exemption Types. This section contains the most current exemptions that have been published as final rules for the listed SOR as of the date of this Instruction. The ISO should ensure that a more recent final rule has not been published. There are two types of exemptions from release or disclosure permitted by Title 5, USC 552a:  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 25 2.14.1.1.  A General exemption authorizes the exemption of a SOR from most parts of the Privacy Act. 2.14.1.2.  A Specific exemption authorizes the exemption of a SOR from only a few parts of the Privacy Act. 2.14.2.  Authorizing  Exemptions.    Denial  authorities  may  withhold  release  or  disclosure  of records to the first party requesters using Privacy Act exemptions only when an exemption for the  SOR  has  been  published (see http://dpclo.defense.gov/Privacy/SORNs.aspx ; exemptions are noted in the right column.) the  Federal  Register  as  a in final rule. 2.14.3.  Requesting an Exemption. An ISO who believes that a system requires an exemption from some or all of the requirements of the Privacy Act shall send a request through the Wing Privacy  Office,  the  HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU  Privacy  Office,  and  to  AF  Privacy  Office. Final approval is granted by DPCLO. The request will detail the reasons why the exemption applies, the section of the Act that allows the exemption, and the specific subsections of the Privacy Act from which the system is to be exempted, with justification for each subsection. 2.14.4.  Exemptions.  Exemptions  permissible  under  Title  5  Privacy  Act  are  searchable  at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2012-title5/pdf/USCODE-2012-title5-partI-chap5-subchapII-sec552a.pdf 2.14.4.1.

The    (k)(1)  exemption.  Applies  to  information  specifically  authorized  to  be classified according to DoDM 5200.01, Volume 4, DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)). 2.14.4.3.  The  (k)(2)  exemption.  Applies  to  investigatory  information  compiled  for  law- enforcement purposes by non-law enforcement activities and which is not within the scope of the (j)(2) exemption. However, the AF must allow an individual access to any record that is used to deny rights, privileges or benefits to which he or she would otherwise be entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information (unless doing so would reveal a confidential source). 2.14.4.4.  The  (k)(3)  exemption.  Applies  to  records  maintained  in  connection  with providing protective services to the President and other individuals under Title 18; Crimes and  Criminal  Procedure,  USC,  section  3056;  Powers,  authorities,  and  duties  of  United States Secret Service. 2.14.4.5.  The  (k)(4)  exemption.

The (k)(5) exemption. Applies to investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose  of  determining  suitability,  eligibility,  or  qualifications  for  U.S.  civilian employment, military service, U.S. contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This provision allows protection of confidential sources used in background investigations, employment  26 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 inquiries,  and  similar  inquiries  that  are  for  personnel  screening  to  determine  suitability, eligibility, or qualifications. 2.14.4.7.  The (k)(6) exemption. Applies to testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal or military service,  if  the  disclosure  would  compromise  the  objectivity  or  fairness  of  the  test  or examination process. 2.14.4.8.  The (k)(7) exemption. Applies to evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source. 2.15.  The Federal Records Act, 44 U.  S.C. § 3301. Defines a federal government record as “all books, papers, maps, photographs, machine readable materials, or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government  under  Federal  law  or  in  connection  with  the  transaction  of  public  business  and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, guidance, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the Government or because of the informational value of data in them.”  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 27 Chapter 3 E-GOVERNMENT ACT 3.1.  Overview  of  the  E-Government  Act  of  2002,  44  U.  S.C.  3601.  Congress  finds  the following: 3.1.1.1.  The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly transforming societal interactions and the relationships among citizens, private businesses, and the Government. 3.1.1.2.  The  Federal  Government  has  had  uneven  success  in  applying  advances  in information  technology  to  enhance  governmental  functions  and  services,  achieve  more efficient  performance,  increase  access  to  Government  information,  and  increase  citizen participation in Government. 3.1.1.3.  Most  Internet-based  services  of  the  Federal  Government  are  developed  and presented separately, according to the jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according to function or topic. 3.1.1.4.  Internet-based  Government  services  involving  interagency  cooperation  are especially difficult to develop and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation. 3.1.1.5.  Electronic  Government  has performance and outcomes within and across agencies. impact its through improved  Government 3.1.1.6.  Electronic Government is a critical element in the management of Government, to  be  implemented  as  part  of  a  management  framework  that  also  addresses  finance, procurement,  human  capital,  and  other  challenges  to  improve  the  performance  of Government. 3.1.1.7.  To  take  full  advantage  of  the  improved  Government  performance  that  can  be achieved through the use of  Internet  based technology requires strong leadership, better organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related to information resource management. 3.2.  The Purposes of the E-Government Act are the Following: 3.2.1.  To provide effective leadership of Federal Government efforts to develop and promote electronic  Government  services  and  processes  by  establishing  an  Administrator  of  a  new Office of Electronic Government within the Office of Management and Budget. 3.2.2.  To promote use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen participation in Government. 3.2.3.  To  promote  interagency  collaboration  in  providing  electronic  Government  services, where this collaboration would improve the service to citizens by integrating related functions, and  in  the  use  of  internal  electronic  Government  processes,  where  this  collaboration  would improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes. 3.2.4.  To  improve  the  ability  of  the  Government  to  achieve  agency  missions  and  program performance goals.  28 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 3.2.5.  To  promote  the  use  of  the  Internet  and  emerging  technologies  within  and  across Government agencies to provide citizen-centric Government information and services. 3.2.6.  To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other Government entities. 3.2.7.  To promote better informed decision-making by policy makers. 3.2.8.  To  promote  access  to  high-quality  Government  information  and  services  across multiple channels. 3.2.9.  To make the Federal Government more transparent and accountable. 3.2.10.  To transform  agency operations by utilizing, where appropriate, best practices from public and private sector organizations. 3.2.11.  To  provide  enhanced  access  to  Government  information  and  services  in  a  manner consistent  with  laws  regarding  protection  of  personal  privacy,  national  security,  records retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other relevant laws. 3.3.  Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA). 3.3.1.  Evaluate  Information  Systems  Risk  Management  Framework.  Information  System Owners  (ISO),  Portfolio  Managers  (PfMs),  Program  Managers  (PM),  and  Information Assurance  Managers  (IAM)  shall  address  risks  assessment  on  Personally  Identifiable Information  (PII)  in  an  IT  system  and  plan  the  integration  of  privacy  protections  with appropriate  Information  Assurance  (IA)  controls  into  the  development  life  cycle  of  an information  system.  A  Privacy  Impact  Assessment  (PIA)  shall  be  completed  in  accordance with DoDI 5400.16, DoD Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Guidance. (T-0) 3.3.2.  What is a PIA? The PIA is an analysis of how PII (which is personal information when stored in a SOR) is collected and handled in an IT system: 3.3.2.1.  To  ensure  PII  handling  conforms  to  applicable  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy requirements regarding privacy; 3.3.2.2.  To determine the risks to an individual and the effects of collecting, maintaining and disseminating PII in an electronic information system, and; 3.3.2.3.  To examine and evaluate protections and alternative processes  for  handling PII information to mitigate potential privacy risks. 3.3.2.4.  The  depth  and  content  of  the  PIA  should  be  thorough  and  appropriate  for  the nature of the information to be collected and the size and complexity of the information technology system. 3.3.2.5.  The  PIA  identifies  the  physical,  technical,  and  administrative  controls  that  are needed  to  protect  PII.  Information  Assurance  controls  are  identified  in  DoDI  8500.01, Cybersecurity.  Information  Assurance  controls  will  be  implemented  and  tested  before deployment or release of a system to mitigate specific risks.  Additionally, system owners will determine whether a SORN exists, needs to be created, and/or needs to be amended.    AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 29 3.3.3.  When must a PIA be conducted? 3.3.3.1.  The E-Government Act of 2002 and DoDI 5400.16 require PIAs to be conducted before developing or procuring IT systems or projects that collect, maintain, or disseminate information in identifiable form from or about individuals as defined in DoD 5400.11-R. 3.3.3.2.  PIAs are required to be performed, approved and/or updated as necessary when a system  change  exposes  a  new  privacy  risk  for  which  an  Information  Assurance  control must be identified and tested before re-deployment or re-release of the system. 3.3.3.3.  At the discretion of the commander. 3.3.4.  When  a  PIA  must  be  submitted.    PIAs  are  submitted  120  days  from  the  scheduled operational or expiration date of the Authorization to Operate (ATO) or Interim Authorization to Operate (IATO) on all new and existing systems. This applies to IT systems whenever PII is  collected,  maintained,  used  or  disseminated  for  the  purpose,  other  than  the  user  table,  in electronic  form  about  members  of  the  public,  Federal  personnel,  contractors  or  foreign nationals employed at U.S. military facilities internationally. 3.3.5.  When a PIA is not required. 3.3.5.1.  When Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is not being maintained, collected, stored, used, or disseminated; 3.3.5.2.  An IT system is an approved National Security System (NSS). Administrative and personnel systems that do not meet one or more of the NSS conditions are not exempt from the PIA requirement. 3.3.6.  Who conducts the PIA? The ISO shall conduct a PIA in conjunction with the system PM, IAM and Privacy Manager/Monitor. (T-0) 3.3.7.  Medical IT systems that are Defense Health Agency (DHA) funded or in the AF line- funded portfolio and managed by Air Force Medical Service (AFMS) assets, shall route PIAs through the DHA CIO office for appropriate management, signatures, and oversight. 3.3.8.  All DoD Medical Department IT systems purchased with DHA funds must ONLY be reported to the DoD Information Technology Portfolio Repository (DITPR) via the component Defense Health Agency (DHA). 3.3.9.  Format  and  Digital  Signatures.  PIAs  shall  be  completed  on  DD  Form  2930,  Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), as an unsecured fillable PDF which requires digital signatures as follows, except for medical DHP funded systems.(T-0) 3.3.9.1.  Privacy Impact Assessments processing procedure. 3.3.9.1.1.

The  stated  intention  of  the  Social  Security  Reduction  Plan  is  to  reduce  or eliminate the use of SSN in DoD and AF systems of records, IT systems and forms IAW DoDI 1000.30, Reduction of Social Security Number (SSN) Use Within DoD. The Functional office that owns the record for which SSNs are required to be collected is the Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) for submitting a SSN Justification memorandum with respect to the collection of SSNs for those records. Records Professional, Privacy Manager, and Forms manager will assist to ensure compliance  with  the  SSN  reduction  plan  requirements.  The  use  of  the  SSN  shall  be  limited  to transactions that specifically require the presentation of the SSN to meet a statutory or regulatory requirement. Most applications that require the SSN for specific transactions do not require its use for every transaction. For example, systems that link to financial institutions may need the SSN for initial interactions, but thereafter use an account number or some other form of identification or  authentication.  As  such  there  is  no  need  to  use  the  SSN  for  individuals  to  authenticate themselves as part of every transaction. DoDI 1000.30, Reduction of Social Security Number (SSN) Use Within DoD, is in effect and establishes the following: 5.1.1.  Acceptable  Uses.  Use  of  the  SSN  includes  the  SSN  in  any  form,  including,  but  not limited to truncated, masked, partially masked, encrypted, or disguised SSN. The acceptable uses  of  the  SSN  are  those  that  are  provided  for  by  law,  require  interoperability  with organizations  beyond  the  DoD,  or  are  required  by  operational  necessities.  Such  operational necessities may be the result of the inability to alter systems, processes, or forms due to cost or  unacceptable  levels  of  risk.  Those  systems,  processes,  or  forms  that  claim  “operational necessity”  shall  be  closely  scrutinized.  Ease  of  use  and  unwillingness  to  change  are  not acceptable justifications for continuing to collect SSNs. 5.1.2.  Documenting Acceptable Uses of SSN and other PII specifically. The authorization for use of PII is governed through DoD 5400.11-R. The method by which SSN use is documented shall  be  consistent  with  existing  Privacy  Program  requirements  for  forms,  processes,  IT systems, and systems of records, to include any locally created applications. 5.1.3.  In addition to the documentation required for the use of PII in the PIA and/or SORN, the use of the SSN in any form as part of any collection, transfer, or retention, including locally created user applications, must be specifically documented and justified.  Documentation of the SSN justification shall be retained and available upon request. 5.2.  The Specific Requirement for Use of the SSN. 5.2.1.  Forms  that  collect  SSN  must  have  a  completed  AF  Form  673  and  a  justification memorandum stating the justification for use of the SSN that is addressed to and approved by AF  Privacy  Officer.  Submit  items  to  appropriate  Forms  Manager  IAW  AFI  33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 5.2.2.  A  senior  official  (flag  officer  or  SES  equivalent)  shall  sign  the  SSN  Justification Memorandum stating the justification for use of the SSN. It is unacceptable to collect, retain, use or transfer SSN without an approved justification.  38 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 5.2.3.  The SSN Justification Memo that approves collection of SSN in an IT System shall be forwarded with the PIA and/or SORN to the AF Privacy Officer. The justification memo will be addressed to Defense Privacy Officer for approval/disapproval. (see Attachment 8). 5.2.4.  The DPCLO reviews SSN justifications for IT systems as an adjunct to the biennial PII review process. When justification for SSN use is rejected, the action officer will prepare a plan, to include milestones and a timeline, for the elimination of SSN usage. 5.2.5.  Periodic Review of SSN Use and Justification. SSN use and justification memo review is  a  responsibility  under  the  biennial  review  process  for  all  forms.  IT  systems  Justification memos shall be reviewed in conjunction with the FISMA Annual review. 5.2.6.  Requesting the Social Security Number (SSN). When requesting an individual’s SSN always provide a Privacy Act Statement, Privacy Statement or Privacy Advisory, as applicable. 5.3.  Alternative Means of Identifying Records:  When law, executive order, or regulation does not require disclosing the SSN or if the SOR was created after January 1, 1975, a SSN may be requested, but the individual is not required to disclose it. If the individual refuses to provide their information,  use  alternative  means  of  identifying  records.  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  9397, Numbering System for Federal Accounts Relating to Individual Persons, November 22, 1943, was amended by E.O. 13478, Amendments to Executive Order 9397 Relating to Federal Agency Use of Social Security Numbers, November 18, 2008, which emphasizes the need to protect PII and deletes the mandatory requirement to collecting SSNs. E.O. 9397 (SSN), as amended (E.O. 13478) shall be referenced when cited in a PAS, Privacy Statement, Privacy Advisory, PIA and SORN whenever  a  SSN  is  collected,  used,  stored,  or  disseminated  for  acceptable  uses  within  AF  IT systems, on AF Forms, or in other physical media systems of records. IT systems, AF Forms, and AF records OPRs should also consult DoDI 1000.30, Reduction of Social Security Number (SSN) Use  Within  DoD,  DoD  enclosure  2,  paragraph  2,  Acceptable  Uses.  Contact  the  OPR’s organizational Privacy Office for assistance. 5.4.  Protection of SSN.  SSNs are personal and unique to each individual. The SSN in any form, including,  but  not  limited  to  truncated  (last  4  or  5),  masked,  partially  masked,  encrypted,  or disguised SSN will be Protected as High Impact  PII and marked  FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY (FOUO). Within DoD, do not disclose a person’s SSN to another person without an official need to  know  or  consent  of  the  individual.  Release  of  SSNs  outside  of  the  DoD  are  not  releasable without the person’s consent or unless authorized under one of the twelve exceptions to the Privacy Act (see paragraph 1.16.4.). 5.5.  Reporting Results of Social Security Number Reduction. 5.5.1.  New  Departmental  Forms.  The  AF  Departmental  Forms  Management  Officer  shall maintain a database to produce an annual report every July 1st. This report shall be an input into the Privacy Act section of the annual FISMA Report as required by subchapter III, chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code. The annual report shall contain the following elements: 5.5.1.1.  Number of forms reviewed. 5.5.1.2.  Number of forms requesting SSNs. 5.5.1.3.  Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected. 5.5.1.4.  Examples of forms where SSNs were not allowed.  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 39 5.5.1.5.  Examples of SSN masking or truncation. 5.5.1.6.  For new forms issued below the departmental level (HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, Wing, etc), no database shall be required as set forth in paragraph 4.5.1. 5.5.1.7.  Existing Departmental Forms. The AF Departmental Forms Management Officer shall report annually on July 1st the results of the AF Forms reviews and submit a report to the AF Privacy Officer.  This report shall include the following elements: (T1) 5.5.1.7.1.  Total number of forms in the database. 5.5.1.7.2.  Number of forms reviewed. 5.5.1.7.3.  Number of forms containing SSNs. 5.5.1.7.4.  Number of forms where justifications were questioned. 5.5.1.7.5.  Number of SSN justifications accepted and rejected. 5.5.1.7.6.  Examples of forms where SSNs were not allowed. 5.5.1.7.7.  Examples of SSN masking or truncation. 5.5.1.8.  For existing forms issued yellow departmental level (HAF/MAJCOM/FOA/DRU, Wing, etc.), no reports are required at command and or base levels, with the exception of sharing best practices of specific examples where SSNs were eliminated or better masked, or for metrics collection at the AF level.  40 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 Chapter 6 PROTECTING RECORDS 6.1.  Protecting  Records.  Protecting  privacy  information  is  the  responsibility  of  every  federal employee, military member, and contractor who handles SOR or PII contained in AF records. 6.2.  Protecting  Personal  information  or  PII  Maintained  in  an  Electronic  System.  It  is  AF policy that personal information or PII collected, maintained, and stored in an electronic system shall  be  evaluated  by  the  ISO  for  impact  of  loss  or  unauthorized  disclosure  and  protected accordingly.  Ensure  coordination  is  accomplished  between  IT  system  PMs,  IAMs  and  Privacy Manager.

Five  factors  are  used  when  determining  if  an  agency  is  required  to notify  those  who  may  have  been  affected  by  a  PII  breach.  Agencies  should  take  the  time  to determine the risk of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness surrounding the breach. The factors used in assessing the likely risk of harm are: A6.1.1.  Nature  of  Data  Elements  Breached.  Consider  context  of  the  data  involved  and  the potential  harm,  embarrassment,  inconvenience  or  unfairness  that  might  be  generated  by  its exposure to unauthorized individuals. A6.1.2.  Likelihood the Information is Accessible and Useable. Upon discovery of a breach, agencies should assess the likelihood the personally identifiable information has been or will be used by unauthorized individuals.  The  greater the risk that  the information may be used unlawfully should influence an agency’s decision to provide notification to the individual(s). A6.1.3.  Likelihood the breach may lead to harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness to an individual. A6.1.3.1.  Broad  Reach  of  Potential  Harm,  Embarrassment,  Inconvenience  or Unfairness. Consider the possible harm associated with the loss or compromise of the PII, i.e., loss of self- esteem, mental pain or emotional stress. A6.1.3.2.  Likelihood  Harm,  Embarrassment,  Inconvenience  or  Unfairness  Will Occur. Agencies must determine the type of data has been compromised and the manner the breach occurred. A6.1.4.  Ability  of  the  Agencies  to  Mitigate  the  Risk  of  Harm,  Embarrassment, Inconvenience or Unfairness.  In addition to containing the breach, agencies must determine what countermeasures will be used to prevent further compromise of the system’s PII.   AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 65 Attachment 7 EXAMPLE PRIVACY BREACH NOTIFICATION LETTER OFFICIAL LETTERHEAD Dear Mr. John Miller: On 3 January 2013, an individual assigned to XXX unit, sent an e-mail with an attachment (alpha roster, recall roster, and information document) containing your Personal Information which may be protected under the Privacy Act of 1974 from their government e-mail to their personal e-mail account.  i.e. Yahoo, Gmail, or Hotmail. The e-mail contained your name, social security number, residential address, date of birth, personal e-mail address, and home telephone numbers. Based on the preliminary investigation, we have determined there was no malicious intent. We recommend you visit the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on its Web site at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0275-place-fraud-alert. The FTC urges that you immediately place an initial fraud alert on your credit file.  The fraud alert is for a period of 90 days, during which, creditors are required to contact you before a new credit card is issued or an existing card changed.  The site also provides other valuable information that can be taken now or in the future if problems should develop.  The Air Force does not endorse this site or provide fraud credit protection. As the commander of xxxxxx, I take this loss very seriously and I am reviewing our current policies and practices to determine what must be changed to preclude a similar occurrence in the future.  At a minimum, I will be providing additional training to personnel to ensure that they understand the importance of safeguarding individual’s Personal Information at all times and must be treated in a manner that preserves and protects the confidentiality of the individual. I deeply regret and apologize for any inconvenience and concern this may cause you. Should you have any questions, please call     Sincerely, Signature Block (Directorate level or higher)   .  66 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 Attachment 8 PREPARING A DOD SSN JUSTIFICATION MEMORANDUM MEMORANDUM FOR AIR FORCE PRIVACY OFFICE, SAF/A6XA  SUBJECT:  Justification for the Use of the Social Security Number (SSN) The memorandum should begin by naming the DITPR number of the IT system and/or form that is the subject of the justification.  The description must be sufficiently detailed so that someone unfamiliar with the system can grasp the general understanding of its intent. The justification for the use of the SSN must include a reference to the SSN Instruction Use Case that is being used to justify the use of the SSN.  If the justification does not fall under either the operational necessity use case or the legacy system interface use case, then the justification shall also include the specific reference to the law that requires the use of the SSN and why it is applicable to the use being justified. Reference is made to the system or form supporting documentation, including but not limited to, System of Records Notice (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) notice, or any other documentation that may be appropriate.  If the substance of the documentation is not attached, reference is made to how the reader may gain access to this documentation. Justification for the use of the SSN does not constitute blanket permission to use the SSN. Specific reference shall be made to indicate actions being taken to reduce the vulnerability of SSNs, which may include indicating where SSNs are being removed from transactions, where SSNs are no longer displayed, or any other protections that have been included.  It should be obvious to the reader that a thorough effort has been made to evaluate the risk associated with the system or form and that every reasonable step has been or is being taken to reduce the use of the SSN and protect it where the use is still required. Justification for the use of the SSN does not constitute blanket permission to use the SSN.

They do not reflect official policies or positions of the Department of Defense. 1. Religion. a. Scenario: During the work day, a military unit attended a religious themed movie at the base theater. Members were given the choice of watching the movie or cleaning the barracks while the unit watched the movie. A week later a member of the unit submitted a complaint. In his complaint, he said he chose to watch the movie because he viewed cleaning the barracks as punishment, but now he feels like his religious freedom was violated. He does not think a punishment, like cleaning the barracks, should be an alternative to watching a religious themed movie. b.  Civil Liberties Issue: First Amendment; Freedom of Religion. A service member should not be punished for participating or not participating in a religious activity. If the service member's belief that he faced a punishment for not attending the movie is accurate, his unit leadership should be counseled about the necessity of allowing for unit member religious freedom without the threat of punishment. 2. Social Media Use & Operational Security. a. Scenario:  A deployed service member posted a photograph on Facebook. The caption indicated that his team had just returned from a patrol, and the date/time stamp on the photo showed exactly when it was taken. The service member’s chain of command told him to take down the photograph, to protect operational security. However, the service member stated that he was using his personal Facebook account, during his personal time (not while on duty), and not claiming to represent or speak for the military. b.  Civil Liberties Issue:  Freedom of Speech/Expression. While individuals have a right to express themselves through online social media outlets, such expression must not compromise operational security. DTM 09-026, “Responsible and Effective Use of Internet-based Capabilities,” Attachment 2, section 5, states that “when accessing Internet-based capabilities using Federal Government resources in an authorized personal or unofficial capacity, individuals shall employ sound operations security (OPSEC) measures.” Other regulations, like the “Joint Ethics Regulation and the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch,” prohibit the release of non-public information, require appropriate disclaimers of opinions being expressed, and restrict the use of government computers to access and to manage personal sites during official duty time. 3. Service Members’ Political Involvement. a. Scenario:  An active-duty service member placed a bumper sticker on his privately owned vehicle. The chain of command told the service member to remove the sticker, but the service member refused, citing his Constitutional right to freedom of speech and freedom of expression. b. Civil Liberties Issue: Freedom of Speech/Expression/Assembly (to the extent that showcasing one’s political affiliation constitutes assembly). In keeping with the traditional concept that service members on active duty should not engage in partisan political activity, and that service members not on active duty should avoid inferences that their political activities imply or appear to imply official sponsorship, approval, or endorsement, the military may regulate service members’ participation in political activities. According to DoDD1344.10, Sec 4.1.1.8. “A member of the Armed Forces on active duty may: display a political bumper  AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 69 sticker on the member’s private vehicle.” In this case, the Directive regulating such participation allows the service member to display the bumper sticker. Unit leadership should be counseled about DoD policies regulating service members’ participation in political activities. 4. Search and Seizure. a. Scenario:  A DoD civilian, employed at a CONUS Air Force base, was randomly selected to have his vehicle searched at the gate. The gate guard inspected the engine compartment, exterior and undercarriage of the vehicle, and the interior of the vehicle, including the glove box and consoles. The employee submitted a complaint to the base Civil Liberties Officer, alleging that a search of the glove box and consoles was excessive and unreasonable. b. Civil Liberties Issue: Right to be Secure against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures. Installation commanders issue regulations for the protection and security of property or places under their command. The search followed established procedures for vehicle searches, per direction provided in Air Force Instruction 31-204 “Air Force Motor Vehicle Traffic Supervision.” In evaluating this type of case, consider whether a command authorizes the search of glove boxes and consoles. For example, the AFI instructs officials conducting searches of vehicles entering a military installation to “look under all seats, under/behind dash, glove box, consoles, visors, ashtrays and any packages and briefcases.” 5. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell – With Speech/Religion Implications. a. Scenario:  A service member speaks with a friend, informally on base, about the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell. The service member, consistent with her religion, expressed opposition to homosexuality. The service member’s senior overheard comments and told her to stop expressing these views on base. The service member filed a Civil Liberties complaint, alleging that her freedom of speech/religion was violated when she was told to stop expressing her religious views on base. b. Civil Liberties Issue:  Freedom of Speech/Religion. Service members may express moral or religious beliefs, so long as service members do NOT make statements detrimental to good order and discipline, and so long as service members obey lawful orders. Whether or not the service member’s Civil Liberties were, in fact, violated is dependent upon whether or not her comments fall within the constraints articulated in the direction above. 6. Carrying Privately Owned Weapons on Military Installations. a. Scenario: Service member living in family housing aboard a Marine Corps base is required to report to the Provost Marshall that she possesses a firearm and stores it at her home. The service member filed a complaint with the Civil Liberties POC arguing that the Provost Marshall should not be keeping records on how she exercises her right to keep and bear arms. b.  Civil  Liberties  Issue:  Right  to  Keep  and  Bear  Arms.  In  reviewing  the  service  member's complaint, consider whether the PM's requirement  to report the firearm is authorized by a base order or other regulation. 7. Civilian Employment Complaint. a. Scenario:  A DoD civilian supervisor typically allows overtime for all employees who volunteer. However, a civilian employee in that office submitted a complaint, alleging that he has not been allowed to work overtime because the supervisor saw him at an anti-war protest on a Saturday last year. His complaint letter alleged that because his supervisor will not allow him to work overtime, his Civil Liberties are being violated. b. Civil Liberties Issue:  Right to Due Process. His complaint about not being allowed to work overtime, when other workers are encouraged to work overtime, could be a recognized employee grievance. Direct him to consider the use of his agency's existing employee grievance process.  70 AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 8. Member of Public, Pentagon Protests, and Suspicious Activity Reporting. a. Scenario:  A member of the public attended a protest at the Pentagon. He followed all rules and procedures governing the protest, including not making threatening statements or displaying threatening behavior, and complied with instructions from Pentagon Police Officers. The individual submitted a complaint alleging that a civilian employee, employed at the Pentagon, asked each of the protestors to identify themselves and subsequently stated that he was going to identify them in a suspicious activity report, due to their participation in the protest. b. Civil Liberties Issue:  Freedom of Speech, Peaceable Assembly. Consider whether the Privacy Act of 1974 is implicated by the Pentagon employee’s actions. According to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(7)), “no information shall be maintained on how an individual exercises rights protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, including the freedoms of speech, assembly, press and religion, except as follows: i. When specifically authorized by statute. ii.  When expressly authorized  by the  individual,  group  of  individuals,  or  association  on whom the record is maintained. iii. When the record is pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity.   AFI33-332  12 JANUARY 2015 71 Attachment 11 CIVIL LIBERTIES COMPLAINT REPORT INSTRUCTIONS Introduction  Section 803 of Public Law 110-53 requires the Department to report its Civil Liberties activities  to Congress. In order to comply with that requirement, each DoD Component must submit a semi-annual report to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office (DPCLO). DPCLO will consolidate Component data and submit the Department's reports to Congress.  Component reports must include the following:  (1) The number and nature of Civil Liberties complaints received; and  (2) A summary of the disposition of such complaints.  Semi-Annual reports are due by the 10th day of the month following the closing of each fiscal year quarter to the AF Civil Liberties POC: usaf.pentagon.saf-cio-a6.mbx.af-privacy@mail.mil  Component Points of Contact (POCs) Reporting Responsibilities  POCs are responsible for establishing procedures to report Civil Liberties complaints for their  entire Component.  To ensure the Department is accurately accounting for and addressing Civil Liberties complaints, Component reporting procedures should capture Civil Liberties complaints that may be received by offices such as the Inspector General (IG), Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), and Labor Management Employee Relations (LMER). Component reporting procedures should also ensure that there is no duplicate reporting within the Component.
