NOTE:    The  SCO  does  not  normally  consult  the provisions  of  a  will  to  determine  where  to  send  the  deceased’s  personal  property.    If  SCO cannot find the authorized recipients in paragraphs  1.3.1 through  1.3.5, then they may send the personal property to a beneficiary in a will. 1.4.  Roles and Responsibilities. 1.4.1.

When  a  military  member  dies  on  active  duty,  the  SCO  will  dispose  of personal  property  within  90  days.  Use  Attachment  2,  SCO  Checklist,  to  accomplish  duties. EXCEPTION:    If  a  dispute  arises  over  an  Air  Force  determination  of  the  PERE,  disposition may take longer.  Shipment of personal property from overseas may be delayed due to customs and legal requirements of the foreign country involved.  All claims for damages to real property resulting from the death of a member on active duty, occurring off installation, are a civil matter.  There is no provision for the Air Force to cover these costs.  Due to various causes/manners of death,  the  SCO  may  be  questioned  as  to  how  the  location  of  death  (residence,  automobile, clothing, etc.) is to be cleaned.  If the death took place in a residence, refer the lien holder/leaser to  the  insurance  company  which  insures  the  deceased’s  residence/property.    Another  source  of funds  may  be  a  security  deposit  which  might  settle  costs  associated  with  the  clean-up.    For deaths  occurring  in  an  automobile,  the  company  insuring  the  vehicle  should  be  consulted  as  a possible  source  to  cover  associated  clean-up  or  repair  cost.    If  the  lien  holder/leaser  persists, request  their  contact  information  and  advise  them  you  will  ensure  the  legal  next  of  kin  is provided  their  information.    Consult  with  the  Mortuary  Officer  and  SJA  as  appropriate  for guidance.    This  is  the  extent  the  SCO  and  Mortuary  Officer  is  able  to  assist  these  parties.  Mortuary  Funds  cannot  be  utilized  to  clean  personal  clothing  items  of  the  deceased.    Any clothing  items  soiled  with  blood  or  bodily  fluid  should  be  disposed  of  as  medical  waste  in accordance with paragraph  3.2.4.2 of this instruction. 10 AFI34-511  21 APRIL 2016 Chapter 2 HANDLING AND DISPOSING PERSONAL EFFECTS (PE) OF DECEASED PERSONNEL 2.1.  This  chapter  describes  the  procedures  for  handling  and  disposing  of  the  personal effects of deceased personnel.  Chapter 3 describes the procedures for handling and disposing of personal property. 2.1.1.  Personal  effects  are  broadly  defined  as  any  personal  item,  organizational  clothing  or equipment  physically located on the  remains.   Personal  effects  shipped  with  the remains or directly  to  the  authorized  recipient  are  not  to  be  treated  in  the  same  manner  as  personal property.  Personal property is disposed of by the SCO and usually shipped later. 2.2.  Inventorying Personal Effects.  The Mortuary Officer will: 2.2.1.  Inventory PE using DD Form 1076. 2.2.2.  List every item with a full description.  Annotate “LAST ITEM” below last item and draw a line through the rest of the form.  Sign and date the form.  Attach additional sheets as necessary. 2.2.3.  Thoroughly  inspect  remains  to  ensure  all  PE  is  found.    If  needed,  check  pockets  of clothing to ensure all PE is accounted for. 2.2.4.  Take  digital  photos  of  the  PE  and  include  as  documentation  in  the  case  file  (Port Mortuary only). 2.2.5.  The inventory sheet(s) must accompany the personal effects at all times.  Keep a copy for the case file. 2.2.6.  For  deaths  under  investigation  or  when  circumstances  dictate  PE  cannot  be inventoried  immediately,  perform  a  visual  inventory  and  annotate  the  inventory  sheet.  Conduct a complete inventory as soon as possible, and make every attempt to ensure PE will be returned when available. 2.3.  Personal  Effects  Containing  Organizational  Clothing  and  Individual  Equipment (OCIE).  The SCO: 2.3.1.  Collects all OCIE (i.e., parkas, cold weather footwear) when such items are no longer required  for  investigation,  and  inventories  on  DD  Form  1076.    SCO  contacts  the  deceased member's squadron commander to arrange the return of all issued organizational equipment and clothing to the squadron. 2.3.2.  Contacts  the  PERE  to  determine  if  they  desire  any  of  the  remaining  organizational clothing.  NOTE:  Dangerous articles and weapons may not be offered to the PERE. 2.3.3.  Includes  any  organizational  clothing,  not  turned  in  to  the  member's  squadron, requested by the PERE, on DD Form 1076. 2.3.4.  Makes a separate DD Form 1076 for the organizational clothing and equipment to be turned into supply. 2.3.5.  Ensures the supply officer signs the DD Form 1076 accepting the items. AFI34-511  21 APRIL 2016 11 2.3.6.  Includes  any  organizational  clothing  the  PERE  desires  with  the  rest  of  the  personal property. 2.4.  Securing Personal Effects.  The Mortuary Officer completes the inventory, cleans the PE, and locks it in a secure area such as a cabinet, safe, or room.  Establishes and maintains a log for deposit and withdrawal of PE from the secured storage area.   2.5.  Disposition of Personal Effects. 2.5.1.  Once  the  Mortuary  Officer  has  ensured  the  PERE  has  been  officially  notified  of  the death, the Mortuary Officer requests the PERE provide instructions for disposition of the PE.  Options include using the military escort or mail. 2.5.1.1.  Via Military Escort:  The military escort can hand deliver the PE to the receiving funeral  home  or  to  the  PERE.    Military  escorts  will  check  the  inventory  sheet(s), inventory,  and  accept  responsibility  for  the  personal  effects  by  signing  the  inventory sheet.    Two  copies  of  the  DD  Form  1076  inventory  should  accompany  the  PE  Escorts will annotate the inventory sheet with the name of the person who accepted responsibility for  final  disposition  of  the  effects  and  will  have  that  person  (funeral  director  or  PERE) sign the inventory sheet.   Signed DD Form 1076 will be maintained in  summary courts file. 2.5.1.2.  Via  US  Mail  or  delivery  service:    Mail  PE  expeditiously  to  the  PERE,  base mortuary  office,  or  funeral  director.    Use  a  mail  or  delivery  service  that  has  tracking capability and require a signature at the receiving destination.  Include the inventory sheet and  an  addressed,  stamped  envelope  with  the  PE  and  request  the  receiving  party  sign, date,  and  return  the  DD  Form  1076.    Call  the  recipient  prior  to  sending  to  advise  what items are being sent and when they will arrive to ensure receipt and reduce any emotional trauma to the family. 2.5.2.  Ensure  only  the  items  the  PERE  requested  be  shipped  with  the  remains  are  on  the remains or in the casket and are visible if the casket is opened. 2.5.3.  Ensure the escort and receiving funeral director are notified if PE is shipped with the remains. 2.5.4.  Ensure the PERE is advised of the nature of the PE on hand before shipping. 2.6.  Destroying Personal Effects. 2.6.1.  Mortuary  personnel  have  no  authority  to  arbitrarily  destroy  personal  effects.  If  the remains are being shipped to a port mortuary, all PE should be shipped with the remains and the port mortuary personnel should contact AFMAO to obtain instructions from the PERE. 2.6.2.  If the PERE agrees mortuary personnel should destroy some items, record the PERE’s instructions in the case file and annotate the items to be destroyed on the DD Form 1076. 2.6.3.  On  all  items  to  be  destroyed,  the  Mortuary  Officer  should  wait  for  written authorization  by  the  PERE  before  destroying  items.  Ensure  items  are  destroyed  beyond recognition. 2.6.4.  After  destruction,  annotate  destroyed  items  on  the  DD  Form  1076.    Place  the documentation in the case file. 12 AFI34-511  21 APRIL 2016 2.6.5.  For additional information regarding destruction of property see paragraph  3.2.4.3 2.7.  Record  Final  Disposition  of  Personal  Effects:  Ensure  the  signed  and  dated  DD  Form 1076  is  included  in  the  case  file.

In either case, the SCO sends a formal letter of introduction to the  PERE  within  3  duty  days  after  appointment  as  SCO  to  advise  them  of  summary  court actions.  The SCO will also explain the need for any additional information necessary to help with  disposition,  e.g.,    power  of  attorney,  if  needed.    When  speaking  to  the  family,  all references  to  the  deceased  should  be  stated  in  a  personal  nature  such  as  “Capt  Jones’ wristwatch”  and  not  as  “the  deceased’s  wristwatch.”    The  SCO  should  coordinate  all outgoing correspondence with the Mortuary Officer. 3.1.3.

The  SCO  has  no  authority  to  arbitrarily   When  possible,  soiled, destroy  personal  property  in  these  two  categories. bloodstained,  or  torn  clothing  should  be  made  presentable  by  the  SCO  or  Mortuary Officer using FSS O&M Funds to cover cleaning expenses through commercial vendors.  However, the PERE should be asked if they would like to have the items, and if so, state the  condition  of  the  items  and  that  they  will  be  cleaned  before  return.    Opened  mail, papers, photographs, videotapes, books, magazines, and other such items will be screened for suitability.  The SCO should pay close attention to cell phones, iPods, digital cameras, and  computers  to  ensure  these  and  like  devices  do  not  contain  unfit  items.    If  so,  all efforts should be made to ensure this data is removed and transferred from the device to a storage  medium  for  retention  until  a  decision  on  destruction  is  made.    Exposed,  but unprocessed film will be processed using FSS O&M Funds and screened for suitability.  The  Mortuary  Officer  will  ensure  FSS  funds  are  available  to  the  SCO  to  cover  these expenses. AFI34-511  21 APRIL 2016 15 3.2.4.3.
