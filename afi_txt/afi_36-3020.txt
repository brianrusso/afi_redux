Dependent Travel to a Designated Place (DTDP). 2.1.1.  General  Provisions.    This  program  applies  to  an  Airman  selected  to  serve  a  short, dependent restricted overseas tour or an Airman electing to serve an unaccompanied overseas tour  and  does  or  does  NOT  have  an  approved  overseas  follow-on  assignment  (See  JFTR, Volume 1, paragraph U5222).  The following are the specific provisions for each process: 2.1.1.1.  Dependent  Travel  to  a  Designated  Place  with  an  approved  overseas  Follow-on Assignment:    This  program  applies  to  an  Airman  with  an  approved  overseas  follow-on assignment.    The  program  allows  an  Airman  to  apply  to  relocate  their  dependents  to OCONUS or non-foreign OCONUS location (the Airman’s follow-on location) while the Airman is serving the dependent restricted or unaccompanied tour.  See paragraph 2.1.2. 2.1.1.2.  Dependent Travel to a Designated Place without a Follow-on Assignment: This program applies to an Airman without an approved follow-on assignment.  The  program  allows  an  Airman  to  apply  to  relocate  their  dependents  to  a  non-foreign OCONUS location (Alaska, Hawaii, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and US territories and possessions) while the Airman  is serving  a  short, dependent  restricted overseas or unaccompanied overseas tour. 2.1.1.2.1.  IAW  the  JFTR,  Volume  1,  U5222,  Airmen  can  relocate  dependents  to  a non-foreign  OCONUS  location  if  that  location  was  the  Airman’s  place  of  legal residence before entering active duty, or Airman’s spouse’s place of legal residence at time  of  marriage.    In  addition,  if  an  Airman  was  called  to  active  duty  from  a  non-foreign  OCONUS  location  or  it  is  the  Airman’s  home  of  record,  they  may  relocate dependents to that place. 2.1.1.2.2.  Requests to relocate dependents to a non-foreign OCONUS location do not require  approval  from  AFPC.    This  is  basic  authorization  according  to  the  JFTR, Volume I, as it serves the same intent of moving dependents to a designated place in the CONUS. 2.1.1.2.3.  Airmen  requesting  to  relocate  dependents  to  a  non-foreign  OCONUS location  based  on  rationale  provided  in  paragraph  2.1.1.2.1  must  provide  proof  of conditions (enlistment contract, marriage license, etc).  Once proof has been provided to  the  MPF/S,  the  appropriate  statement  may  be  annotated  on  orders  depicting dependents  residence  IAW  AFI  36-2102,  Base-Level  Relocation  Procedures, Attachment 6. 2.1.2.  Purpose.    Dependent  Travel  to  a  Designated  Place  applications  are  used  to  request government  funded  travel  to  a  specified  location  (follow-on  assignment  location)  while  the Airman serves the short dependent restricted or unaccompanied tour and has a follow-on to an OCONUS location.  For Example:    An Airman has an assignment to Osan AFB, Korea with an approved Follow-on assignment to Ramstein AB, Germany and the Airman requests to  relocate  command  sponsored  dependents  to  the  Follow-on  location.    Note:    Airman AFI36-3020  22 OCTOBER 2009 7 electing to relocate their dependents to a location other than where they are eligible (as listed above) must obtain approval through the Secretarial Process. 2.1.3.  Requirements.    An  Airman  submitting  a  Dependent  Travel  to  a  Designated  Place application must have the following: 2.1.3.1.  The retainability to serve the accompanied tour length at the follow-on location. 2.1.3.2.  A memorandum signed by the Airman with the following information: Dependents names and birthdates (children’s birthdates required only), Overseas travel destination, and reason for request  Note:    Although  it  is  not  mandatory,  it  is  helpful  to  know  whether  or  not  a dependent(s)  is  a  dual  citizen  of  another  overseas  country.    This  is  beneficial because  it  helps  in  determining  what  kind  of  support  dependents  can  receive while  the  Airman  is  serving  the  dependent-restricted  tour  or  unaccompanied tour.  For example, an Airman assigned to Beale AFB, CA has an assignment to Korea  with  a  follow-on  to  Germany  and  elects  to  move  the  dependents  (dual German/American  citizenship)  to  Germany  while  serving  in  Korea.    Because there  is  limited  logistical  support  for  dependents  due  to  the  Airman  not  being assigned to Germany, knowing the dependents have dual citizenship informs the approval authority that if support cannot be granted on base, they can obtain it from the host government.  Airmen must keep in mind that although dependents may  be  authorized  to  relocate  to  a  designated  place,  dependents  are  not considered “command sponsored” until such time they are joined by the Airman and therefore, in most cases, are not afforded protection under SOFA provisions of the host nation.  They are subject to the laws of the host nation. 2.1.3.3.  A  signed  benefits/entitlements  fact  sheet  applicable  to  the  country  where dependents  will  relocate  and  reside.    Benefits/Entitlement  fact  sheets  are  located  at  the AFPC  web  page:   http://ask.afpc.randolph.af.mil/main_content.asp?prods1=99& prods2=327&prods3=331&prods4=1246&prods5=1251&p_faqid=8195 for benefits/entitlements  fact  sheet).

PCS orders to Follow-on location (if applicable) 2.2.  Designated Location Move (DLM). 2.2.1.  General  Provisions.      This  program  applies  to  Airmen  with  a  foreign-born  spouse.  The  program  allows  an  Airman  with  a  foreign-born  spouse  (spouse/dependents  must  be command  sponsored  if  currently  residing  overseas  with  sponsor  serving  an  accompanied tour) to apply for government funded travel to the spouse’s native country (designated place) (See JFTR,  Volume 1, paragraph U5222-D1d[2]).  (Note:   If the DLM request  is  approved and the Airman relocates their dependents to the same country as that in which he or she will serve, then the Airman’s tour length will be extended by 12 months.  The Airman will NOT receive short tour credit upon completion of the overseas tour).   DLM  applications  are  submitted 2.2.2.  Purpose. to  request  government  funded transportation  of  foreign  born  dependents  to  the  spouse’s  native  country  when  the  Airman has been selected for a short, dependent restricted tour.  The DLM application must clearly demonstrate  the  foreign  born  spouse  is  unable  to  cope  in  the  CONUS  or  OCONUS  area during the Airman’s absence due to language barriers, no driver’s license, etc. The following are DLM examples: 2.2.2.1.  An  Airman  has  been  selected  to  serve  a  dependent  restricted  tour  at  Osan,  AB Korea  and  has  a  Korean  spouse.    The  spouse  has  been  in  the  U.S.  less  than  3  years, cannot understand English enough to pay bills and conduct day to day business without the  help  of  the  military  sponsor.    The  Commander  interviewed  the  Airman  and  spouse and assessed that the spouse will have difficulties coping.   The Airman  applied for and received an approved DLM to Korea.  The Airman’s tour length will be 24 months and the  DEROS  will  be  updated  accordingly.    The  Airman  does  NOT  receive  short  tour credit. Or 2.2.2.2.  An  Airman  has  been  selected  to  serve  a  dependent  restricted  tour  at  Osan,  AB Korea, has a foreign born spouse from the Philippines.  The spouse has been in the U.S. less than 3 years, cannot understand English enough to pay bills and conduct day to day business  without  the  help  of  the  military  sponsor.    The  Commander  interviewed  the Airman  and  spouse  and  assessed  that  the  spouse  will  have  difficulties  coping.    The Airman applied for and received an approved DLM to the Philippines.  The dependents relocate to the Philippines at government expense while the Airman serves the 12 month dependent  restricted  tour  in  Korea.    The  Airmen  receives  short  tour  credit  upon completion of the overseas tour. 2.2.3.  Requirements:  An Airman submitting a DLM application must have the following: Note:  The DLM application is a ―self-service‖ application offered through the vMPF.

This  program  applies  to  Airmen  currently  assigned overseas.    The  program  allows  an  Airman  to  request  that  their  command  sponsored dependents remain overseas for a specific length of time after the Airman out-processes and departs the overseas duty station. 2.3.1.2.  Purpose.  Dependents  residing  in  a  host  nation  with  their  military  sponsor  are afforded certain privileges set forth by the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the host nation and the U.S.  When the military member departs and leaves dependents in the host nation, some SOFAs do not allow for continued privileges, such as tax-free fuel, continued enrollment in DODDS, etc.  A DRO addresses limitations of continued support and  provides  for  continuation  of  COLA/  OHA/BAH  (See  JFTR,  Volume  1,  paragraph U10412)  for  the  dependent  location,  unless  member  is  assigned  family  quarters  at  new PDS,  when command sponsored dependents  remain  at  the current  overseas location.  A DRO application is submitted after an Airman is selected for an assignment and prior to his or her departure from the overseas duty station.  The following are DRO examples: 2.3.1.2.1.  An  Airman  has  a  dependent  restricted  assignment  to  Korea  and  requests his/her dependents remain in Alaska while serving the overseas dependent restricted tour  or 2.3.1.2.2.

General  Provisions.  CCTVL  is  the  authorization  of  the  overseas  gaining  installation commander  to  have  dependents  travel  concurrently  with  Airman.    (CCTVL  is  also appropriate  for  CONUS  locations  that  do  not  have  adequate  support  facilities  to accommodate  families  due  to  natural  disasters/special  circumstances  [Example:    Keesler AFB,  MS  in  the  aftermath  of  Hurricane  Katrina]).    (See  JFTR,  Volume  1,  U5222-N1  and U5222-N5.) 2.6.2.  Purpose.     CCTVL  identifies  that  installation  support  facilities  can  support dependents upon arrival. A list of ―automatic‖ CCTVL locations can be located on the AFPC home page:  (MPF-PDS Support-MPF/CSS Support-Search on ―concurrent travel‖).   When CCTVL is  automatic, dependent  travel  and transportation allowances are authorized for the duration  of  the  time  the  PCS  order  is  in  effect  (until  a  subsequent  PCS  order  is  received).  This means that dependents are authorized to travel independently of the Airman as long as they are listed as dependents on the PCS order and Airman is serving the ―accompanied by dependents‖ tour length. However, to  ship HHG, the Airman must have  at  least  12 months remaining on current tour.  (See JFTR, Volume 1, paragraphs U5203D, U5222C2,   U5330H, and U5350.) 2.6.3.  Requirements.    If  CCTVL  is  not  automatic  the  losing  MPF/S  Career  Development element  must  request  CCTVL  through  the  gaining  MPF/S  Force  Management  element, utilizing procedures outlined in the PSD Handbook (formerly AFCSM 36-699, Volume 1). 2.6.4.  Process. 2.6.4.1.  The losing MPF/S Career Development element submits the request on behalf of the Airman through MILPDS or e-mail. 2.6.4.2.  The  gaining  MPF/S  Force  Management  element  receives  the  request  and forwards  it  to  the  FSS  CC  or  (MPF/S  CC/Superintendent/Force  Management  staff  if delegated). 2.6.4.3.  The  gaining  MPF/S  Force  Management  element  informs  the  losing  MPF/S Career  Development  element  if  CCTVL  is  approved  or  disapproved.    If  CCTVL  is denied, a time frame should be given when dependent support facilities will be available and the dependents can travel. 2.7.  Command Sponsored Position List and Key Billet Concurrent Travel. 2.7.1.  General Provisions. 2.7.1.1.  Command Sponsored Position List (CSPL).  The command sponsorship program provides  a  systematic  method  for  enhancing  mission  effectiveness  in  critical  positions that  require  continuity  and  stability.
