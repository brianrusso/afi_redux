Scope.  This  instruction  prescribes  the  basic  policy,  procedures,  and  guidance  for  training crew  members  in  B-52  aircraft.    It  incorporates  a  decentralized  training  philosophy  by  placing increased  responsibility  for  training  at  the  unit  level.    Because  aviation  skills  are  very individualized  and  experience-dependent,  training  in  this  regulation  also  incorporates  a  tiered approach  to  training  and  emphasizes  the  needs,  requirements,  and  responsibilities  of  the individual  crew  member.    Emphasis  is  also  placed  on  the  responsibility  of  the  Aircraft Commander for his or her crew’s level of training, proficiency, and effectiveness. 1.2.  Objective.  The  objective  of  this  instruction  is  to  define  and  establish  the  training requirements  for  crews  and  individuals  to  successfully  complete  B-52  operational  missions.  Unless  otherwise  tasked,  training  and  readiness  for  USSTRATCOM’s  nuclear  mission  shall receive the highest priority. 1.3.  Waivers.  Directive  guidance  (will,  shall,  must,  etc.)  throughout  this  AFI  are  tiered  IAW AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management.   For examples of tiered waivers, see AFI 33-360. 1.3.1.  Units subordinate to a NAF will forward waiver requests directly to MAJCOM/A3BT and provide their NAF A3 (AOG) with an informational copy. 1.3.2.  MAJCOM/A3B is approval authority to conduct local IQT, waiver authority to change the  formal  requirements  of  locally  conducted  IQT,  and  waiver  authority  for  B-52  syllabus requisites. MAJCOM/CC is the approval authority for non-formal course IQT (Senior Officer Training) for Colonel selects and above conducted at the officer’s assigned unit. 1.4.  References, Abbreviations, Acronyms, and Terms.  See Attachment 1. 1.4.1.  For  clarification,  the  Weapon  System  Operator  and  Dual  Seat  Pilot  (DSP)  program introduced a discrepancy in some crew member nomenclature as defined in T.O. 1B-52H-1, Flight Manual USAF Series B-52H Aircraft.  Differences are noted below: 1.4.1.1.  Pilots. 1.4.1.1.1.  Aircraft Commander (AC).   An aircrew member who has  graduated from the B52 AC/ACA course.  This position is identified in the T.O. 1B-52H-1 as the “P” position.    For  the  purposes  of  this  instruction,  this  position  is  identified  as  “AC”.   IAW AFI 11-401 the aircrew position indicator is “P” for flight record purposes. 1.4.1.1.2.  Pilot (P).  An aircrew member who graduated from the B52 PIQ or CMPIQ course.  This position is identified in the T.O. 1B-52H-1 as the “CP” position.  For the purposes of this instruction, this position is identified as “P”.   IAW AFI 11-401 the aircrew position indicator is “C” for flight record purposes. 1.4.1.2.  Weapon System Officer (WSO).  An aircrew member who graduated from either the  B52  NIQ,  B52  RNIQ,  B52  RNUP/RNUPA,    B52  DSNIQ  or  B52  WSOIQ  course.  This  position is  identified in  the T.O. 1B-52H-1as the “N” and “RN” position.   For the AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 7 purposes  of  this  instruction,  this  position  is  identified  as  “WSO”.  IAW  AFI  11-401  the aircrew position indicator is “W” for flight record purposes. 1.5.  Responsibilities: 1.5.1.  HQ  AFGSC/A3  is  responsible  for  this  instruction  IAW  AFPD  11-2.

These  changes may  be  via  MAJCOM  supplement,  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum,  or  immediate  change messages. HQ AFGSC/A3 will be an info addressee on all changes. 1.7.  Training.  Training  programs  are  designed  to  progress  aircrew  from  Initial  Qualification Training (IQT) or Transition/Re-Qualification Training (TX), to Mission Qualification Training (MQT), and then finally to Continuation Training (CT). 1.7.1.  IQT and TX. Provides the training necessary to initially qualify or re-qualify aircrews in a basic position and flying duties without regard to the unit's mission. Upon completion of IQT or TX, the crew member attains Basic Aircraft Qualification (BAQ) status. Aircrew will only remain BAQ until completion of MQT. BAQ is not a permanent qualification except for General Officers above the wing level, and any other crew members specifically authorized by MAJCOM A3. (T-2) 1.7.2.  MQT.    Provides  the  training  necessary  to  initially  qualify  or  requalify  aircrew  in  a specific  position  and  flying  duties  to  perform  the  missions  assigned  to  a  specific  unit. Aircrews  maintain  BAQ  status  until  they  complete  MQT,  which  will  reflect  unit requirements.    MQT  tasks  accomplished  at  the  appropriate  skill  level  in  conjunction  with IQT  can  count  towards  MQT  at  the  squadron  commander’s  discretion.  However,  at completion  of  IQT/TX,  any  further  MQT  training  will  be  accomplished  at  the  unit. Completion of MQT is a pre-requisite for BMC and CMR.  (T-2) 1.7.3.  CT.    The  two  aspects  of  CT  are  proficiency  and  employment.  Proficiency  training consists  of  aircrew  training  in  the  basic  skills  contained  in  the  RAP  Tasking  Memo,  which ensure  safe  operation  of  the  aircraft.    Employment  training  consists  of  specific  mission-related training required to accomplish the unit’s assigned missions. 1.7.4.  Ready  Aircrew  Program  (RAP).    The  RAP  Continuation  Training  program  requires accomplishment of sorties and flying training events for CMR/BMC aircrew, and has a two-10 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 fold  purpose:    First,  it  prescribes  a  basic  set  of  core  events  (nuclear  and  conventional)  to ensure  currency  and  proficiency  based  on  an  individual  crew  member’s  experience  level.  Second, it provides commanders flexibility in tailoring their unit’s training program and CT sorties  for  individual  unit  DOCs,  AEF  taskings,  Combatant  Commander  (CCDR) requirements,  etc.,  while  ensuring  that  all  aircrew  fly  a  minimum  number  of  sorties  per training cycle.  Following completion of IQT/TX and MQT, aircrew members are trained in all the basic missions of a specific unit. The crew member is assigned to a Combat Mission Ready  (CMR),  Basic  Mission  Capable  (BMC),  or  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  (BAQ) position as follows (see also para.  5.2 and para.  5.5.5): 1.7.4.1.  CMR  Positions.  All  combat  coded  unit  Regular  Air  Force  API-1/2  positions, bomb  SQ/CC  and  SQ/DO  positions  are  designated  CMR  positions.  OG/CCs  may designate  other  API-6  positions  not  assigned to  a  bomb  squadron  as  CMR. (EXCEPTION:  If a unit is over-manned, the SQ/CC may elect to train the front line of his/her Unit Manning Document (UMD) API-1/2s to CMR and designate the remaining crewmembers as BMC. In this case, priority should be given to Ready-tier crew members with  at  least  50%,  if  available,  designated  CMR.)  [For  AFRC:  Any  API-1/2/6  may  be designated  CMR  at  OG/CC  discretion.]    CMR  aircrew  will  maintain  appropriate requirements from para.  5.5 for the unit to which they are assigned or attached. (T-2) 1.7.4.2.  BMC Positions.  All other wing aircrew positions, not identified in para.  1.7.4.1, are  designated  BMC  positions.    BMC  designations  are  assigned  to  aircrew  that  have  a primary  job  performing  wing  supervision  or  staff  functions  that  directly  support  the flying  operation,    FTU  instructors  or  operational  test  aircrew.    However,  these  aircrew members are required to provide additional sortie generation capability, either in lieu of, or in addition to, the personnel assigned to the flying squadrons.  BMC aircrews maintain familiarization  with  all  basic  unit  missions.    They  may  also  maintain  proficiency  and qualification  in  some  of  the  unit  core  missions.    The  missions  for  which  they  maintain familiarization only, BMC aircrew must be able to attain proficiency and qualification in 30  days  or  less.    (T-2)    BMC  aircrews  accomplish  all  mission-related  ground  training designated  by  their  attached  SQ/CC.    BMC  aircrew  may  deploy  and  may  participate  in any  mission  for  which  they  are  proficient  and  qualified,  without  additional  training,  as determined by the SQ/CC. 1.7.4.3.  N-CMR/N-BMC.    See  para.    5.2.4,  and  para.    5.8  for  specific  guidance  on regression  or  re-certification  of  crewmembers  who  are  non-current  or  incomplete  in required continuation training.  1.7.4.4.  Specialized  Training.  Specialized  training  is  training  in  any  special  skill(s) necessary to carry out the unit's assigned missions that are not required by every aircrew. Specialized  training  consists  of  upgrade  training  such  as  Flight  Lead  Upgrade  Program (FLUG),  Mission  Lead  (MLUG),  etc.    Specialized  training  may  be  accomplished  in conjunction with MQT if required. Unless otherwise specified, aircrew in CMR or BMC positions  may  hold  special  capabilities/qualifications  (annotated  on  Unit  Certification Letter,  i.e.,  Letter  of  X’s)  as  long  as  any  additional  training  requirements  are accomplished. (T-2) 1.8.  Training Concepts and Policies: AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 11 1.8.1.  Units will design training programs to achieve the highest degree of combat readiness consistent  with  flight  safety  and  resource  availability.  Training  must  balance  the  need  for realism  against  the  expected  threat,  aircrew  capabilities,  and  safety.  This  volume  provides training  guidelines  and  policies  for  use  with  operational  procedures  specified  in  applicable flying/operations publications.  (T-2) 1.8.2.  ACC  Training  Support  Squadron  (ACC  TRSS)  will  develop,  validate,  and  maintain currency  of  B-52  training  programs  when  tasked  by  the  HQ  ACC/A3.    IAW  established Memorandum  of  Agreement,  HQ  AFGSC/A3BT  will  submit  requests  for  TRSS  support through  HQ  ACC/A3.    If  validated,  these  requests  will  be  prioritized  and  tasked  to  ACC TRSS. 1.8.3.  Units  will  design  training  missions  to  achieve  combat  capability  in  squadron  tasked roles,  maintain  proficiency,  and  enhance  mission  accomplishment  and  safety.  RAP  training sorties  should  emphasize  basic  nuclear  or  conventional  combat  skills  (based  on  CMR  RAP events from the RTM, or commander-option scenarios) that reflect procedures and operations based on employment plans, location, current intelligence, and opposition capabilities. Use of procedures  and  actions  applicable  to  combat  scenarios  are  desired  (e.g.,  appropriate  use  of code  words,  authentication  procedures,  combat  tactics,  safe  recovery  procedures,  tactical deception, threat reactions, Intel briefing/debriefing).  (T-2) 1.8.4.  In-flight Supervision 1.8.4.1.  Unless  specifically  directed,  the  SQ/CC  determines  the  level  of  supervision necessary  to  accomplish  the  required  training.  If  the  mission  objectives  include introduction to tasks or instruction to correct previous discrepancies, then an instructor of like specialty may be required.  (T-3) 1.8.4.2.  Instructor  pilots  and  Flight  Lead  (FL)  qualified  SQ  supervisors  may  allow  any pilot  to  lead  limited  portions  of  a  mission  if  appropriately  briefed.  Only  utilize  this provision  to  allow  the  pilot  to  practice  events  in  which  they  are  already  qualified  and current.  In either case the instructor or SQ supervisor is responsible for the flight (must be flying in same formation).  (T-3) 1.8.4.3.  Instructor  Supervision  is  a  qualified  instructor  of  like  specialty,  supervising  a maneuver  or  training  event.    For  WSO,  and  EW,  the  instructor  may  supervise  from  the respective instructor station during all phases of flight.  IP supervision requires the IP to occupy  one  of  the  primary  pilot  seats  with  immediate  access  to  the  controls  during takeoff,  air  refueling,  live/inert  weapon  delivery,  simulated  emergency  events,  low-altitude training, traffic pattern operations, and landing.  During all other phases of flight the IP may supervise from the IP seat.  1.8.5.  Aircrew  will  accomplish  ground  and/or  ancillary  training  as  required  by  AFI  11-202V1, this volume, and AFI 36-2201, Developing, Managing, and Conducting Training. (T-2) 1.9.  Ready Aircrew Program (RAP) Policy and Management: 1.9.1.  Training  Period.    The  B-52  continuation  training  program  is  based  on  a  12-month training period aligned with the Fiscal Year (FY); 1 October to 30 September.  End of cycle 12 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 reports  referenced  in  this  instruction  are  due  when  indicated  following  the  end  of  each Training Period. (T-2) 1.9.2.  Each  RAP  qualification  level  is  defined  by  a  total  number  of  sorties,  plus  specific ground  and  flight  events  as  determined  by  the  MAJCOM  and  unit  commanders.  Units  will complete  training  requirements  during  the  appropriate  training  cycle  except  where specifically  exempted.  Failure  to  complete  the  required  training  sorties  and/or  events  per cycle is addressed in Chapter 5. (T-1) 1.9.3.  The total number of sorties for a CMR or BMC level is the first factor in managing an individual's RAP qualification. 1.9.3.1.  For  the  purpose  of  this  instruction,  takeoff  and  landing  are  the  only  event requirements for sortie credit. The intent is to reflect that every sortie regardless of event activity  requires  a  level  of  BAQ  proficiency  regardless  of  crew  position.  See  sortie descriptions in Attachment 2. 1.9.3.2.  Sorties  should  include  a  mission  area  emphasis  (i.e.,  nuclear,  conventional, other)  but  it  is  not  required  for  sortie  credit.    See  the  RTM  for  sortie  minimums.    See para.  1.10.3 for non-effective post-takeoff (NEPT) sortie guidance. (T-2) 1.9.3.3.  RAP sortie credit in the WST is not permitted. 1.9.4.  Unless  otherwise  tasked,  the  SQ/CC's  first  priority  is  to  ensure  designated  aircrew members meet all nuclear mission (MR42) training requirements and CMR-N status. (T-2) 1.9.5.  Progression from BMC to CMR requires: 1.9.5.1.  Qualification in mission skill sets and weapons events required per RTM. (T-3) 1.9.5.2.  Completion of mission-related ground training, to include a current verification or nuclear mission certification.  (T-2) 1.9.6.  Squadron CC Certification. SQ/CCs will determine and assign aircrew that will train for and maintain special capabilities or qualifications. (T-2) 1.9.7.  End of Cycle training requirements are based on the aircrew's experience level on the last day of the current training cycle.  (T-2) 1.9.8.  RAP Reporting. Squadron RAP reports are intended to provide a snapshot assessment of  squadron  readiness  as  supported  by  RAP  guidance.  Additionally,  this  report  provides  an opportunity for the squadron commander to provide valuable feedback to the MAJCOM on the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  ready  aircrew  training  program.  The  formatted  report templates  and  instructions  are  located  in  the  RAP  Reporting  Templates  section  on  the AFGSC/A3BT website (SharePoint).  Reference current RTM for specific guidance on report due dates. 1.10.  Training Sortie Program Development: 1.10.1.  RAP  sortie  and  event  requirements  (see  Attachment  2)  apply  to  CMR  and  BMC aircrew  and  are  IAW  the  RAP  Tasking  Memorandum  (RTM).    The  RTM  establishes  the minimum number of sorties per training cycle for BMC and CMR levels of training. 1.10.2.  Collateral  or  Cost  of  Business  sortie  requirements  must  be  considered  when developing unit flying hour programs (AFGSC/A3B).  These sorties are not directly related AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 13 to combat employment training but are necessary in day to day unit operations. These include but  are  not  limited  to  instructor  sorties,  ferry  flights,  incentive/orientation  flights, deployments, and air shows. For the training cycle, AFGSC allocates a block of hours to the unit for these purposes. AFRC allocates flying hours for AFRC classic association missions. AFRC Crews will log the appropriate AFRC mission codes. 1.10.3.  Unit flying hour programs are allocated a number of attrition sorties that compensate for  non-effective  training  sorties.  Operations  Group  Commanders  will  coordinate  required operational  attrition  sorties  with  Maintenance  Group  Commanders  via  the  AFI  21-165 scheduling process. When possible, operational attrition sorties will be executed concurrently with scheduled maintenance attrition sorties). 1.10.4.  Aircrew  Training  Devices  (ATD)  are  an  integral  part  of  a  training  sortie  program development plan. 1.10.4.1.  ATD training. 1.10.4.1.1.  Instructors may take applicable event credit when instructing. 1.10.4.1.2.  Fill all crew positions for all integrated simulator missions.  (T-2) 1.10.4.1.3.  When  creditable  (SIMCERT  Code  1),  only  50%  (rounded  up)  of  the proficiency event totals in the RTM may be accomplished in the ATD.  (T-2) 1.10.4.2.  When possible plan ATD missions as  a prerequisite to  the equivalent  mission focused  sortie  (i.e.,  MP/WST/Sortie).  When  accomplishing  this  ATD  as  a  standalone event,  SQ/CC  will  ensure  scheduled  time  is  sufficient  to  accomplish  SQ15/SQ16 emphasis areas. (Attachment 2) (T-2) 1.11.  Training Records and Reports: 1.11.1.  Units  will  maintain  aircrew  member  records  for  individual  training  and  evaluations IAW: (T-2) 1.11.1.1.  AFI 11-202V1, Aircrew Training.  1.11.1.2.

Weapons  employment  records  for  all  actual  releases  in  sufficient  detail  to document all employment attempts as well as to compute Circular Error Probable (CEP) and event hit percentage histories. 1.11.2.5.  Units  are  highly  encouraged  to  utilize  the  PEX  Training  module  for tracking/updating aircrew training accomplishment. 1.11.3.  Units  may  fill  in  ARMS,  "NO  DATE"  events  with  either  the  date  it  was accomplished in FTU, USAFWS, or the unit mission certification date. 1.12.  Weapons Employment Recording: 1.12.1.  Aircrew  members  will  use  all  available  recording  devices  to  document  mission scenarios  and  release  training  to  the  maximum  extent  possible.    These  recording  devices include  Weapons  Impact  Scoring  Set  (WISS),  Range  Integrated  Instrumentation  and Integrated  Tactics  Assessment  Systems  (RIIS  &  ITAS)  screen  capture,  B-52  information download and decoding system (BIDDS), GPS trail, audio recording devices, FRMT-15, and other their recordings/results after every mission.  (T-3)   When  available,  aircrew  members  will recording  systems. review 1.12.1.1.  The  review  should  include  the  following  items:  weapons  release  parameters (both  planned  and  actual),  accuracy,  adherence  to  training  rules  IAW  AFI  11-214,  Air Operations  Rules  and  Procedures  and  range  specific  guidance,  communications procedures  and  discipline,  flight  discipline,  and  tactical  employment  IAW  AFTTP  3-1.B52,   B-52   Tactical   Employment,    AFTTP   3-3.B-52,   B-52   Combat   Aircraft Fundamentals,  maneuvers and tactics.  (T-3) 1.13.  Crew Member Utilization Policy: 1.13.1.  Commanders  will  ensure  that  wing/group  tactical  crew  members  (API-1/2/6s)  fill authorized positions IAW unit manning documents and that crew member status is properly designated.  The  overall  objective  is  that  crew  members  perform  combat-related  duties. Supervisors  may  assign  crew  members  to  valid,  short-term  tasks  (escort  officer,  Flying Evaluation Board (FEB)/mishap board member, etc.), but must continually weigh the factors involved,  such  as  level  of  crew  member  tasking,  flying  proficiency,  currency,  and experience.  For  inexperienced  crew  members  in  the  first  six  months  of  their  initial operational  assignment,  supervisors  should  limit  the  non-flying  duties  to  those  related  to combat activities.  (T-3) 1.13.2.  Duties that may be assigned to CAF API-1/2 crew members are weapons and tactics officer,  programmer,  scheduling  officer,  flying  safety  officer,  Supervisor  of  Flying  (SOF), mobility/contingency  plans,  training  (except  ARMS  documentation),  SQ  Standardization/ Evaluation  Liaison  Officer  (SELO),  squadron  life  support  officer,  squadron  electronic warfare officer, and other duties directly related to flying operations.  In some instances, such as  squadron-assigned  flying  safety  officers  or  SELOs,  API-1/2s  may  be  attached  to  the wing/group.      API-1/2s  will  not  be  attached  to  wing/group  staffs  or  man  wing/group  staff positions  unless  total  wing  API-1/2  manning  is  100%  or  better.    Commanders  will  ensure wing/group  staff  crew  members  (API-6s)  perform  duties  justified  in  MAJCOM  manpower standards documents and authorized in UMDs.  (T-3) 1.14.  Sortie Allocation and Manning Guidance: AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 15 1.14.1.  In  general,  inexperienced  API-1/2  crew  members  should  receive  sortie  allocation priority over Experienced-tier crew members. Priorities for sortie allocation are as follows: 1.14.1.1.  Formal  Training  Units  (FTU  and  USAFWS).  Formal  syllabus  training, Instructor Upgrade, Instructor CT, authorized staff personnel not performing Instructor or SEFE duties (to include API-5 pilot physicians not on instructor orders). 1.14.1.2.  Combined  Formal  Training  (FTU  and  USAFWS)  and  Operational  Units. Formal syllabus training, CMR API-1/2, MQT API-1/2, CMR API-6, MQT API-6, BMC, API-5 aircrew physicians, others.  1.14.1.3.  Operational  Units.  CMR  API-1/2,  MQT  API-1/2,  CMR  API-6,  MQT  API-6, BMC (to include API-5 aircrew physicians).  1.14.1.4.  Test  Units.  Requirements  directed  by  MAJCOM,  training  required  to  prepare for assigned projects/tasking, BMC training requirements that cannot be accomplished on primary missions, API-5 aircrew physicians. 1.14.2.  Wing  API-6  authorizations  are  IAW  unit  manning  documents.    Active  duty  wings converting  to  new  Primary  Mission  Aircraft  Inventory  (PMAI)  are  authorized  one  SQ equivalent  of  additional  API-6s  during  the  conversion  period.    However,  total  wing  staff flying the new aircraft shall not exceed total authorized for final conversion equipment. (T-2) 1.14.3.  For wings consisting of both FTU and operational units, at least one of the following aircrew will maintain formal instructor status: WG/CC, WG/CV, OG/CC, or OG/CD.  (T-2) 1.14.4.  API-8  (above  wing  level  staff,  also  including  AFGSC/TRSS  Det  or  AFGSC/IG) rated  personnel  flying  authorizations  and  test  aircrew  will  be  IAW  AFI  11-401  and MAJCOM  guidance.    Units  should  provide  assigned  API-8  flyers  adequate  resources  to maintain minimum BMC training requirements.  However, API-8 flyer support will not come at the expense of the flying squadron's primary mission.  API-8 flyers will accomplish BAQ requirements with allotted BMC sorties.  API-8/AFGSC IGS/AFGSC TRSS/staff flyers will strive  to  accomplish  BAQ  requirements  with  allotted  BMC  sorties.    (See  the  RTM).    If attached units cannot meet attached flyer requirements, they must request relief IAW AFI 11-401, as supplemented.  (T-2) 1.14.5.  There is no maximum sortie rate for CMR aircrew.  Table 1.3 defines the minimum and  maximum  sortie  requirements  for  other  aircrew.    On  occasion,  unique  operations  may require aircrew to  fly more than the maximum number of sorties authorized.  However this may impact training of other aircrew members.    16 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 Table 1.1.  B-52 Sortie Requirements for Other Than API-1 and 2 Crew Members  (T-2).

This  chapter  outlines  Formal  Training  of  aircrew  members  into  unit  aircraft. Formal Transition (TX)/Requalification/Senior  Officer  training  and  Upgrade  Training.  IQT/TX/SOC  training  will normally  be  conducted  during  formal  syllabus  courses  at  the  formal  training  unit  (FTU) whenever  possible.  In  exceptional  circumstances,  when  FTU  training  is  not  available  within  a reasonable time period, IQT may be conducted at the local unit IAW provisions of this chapter. This local IQT will normally be conducted using appropriate USAF Transition or Requalification Training  Course  syllabus  tracks,  flow  programs,  and  requirements.  When  local  IQT  is authorized,  the  gaining  MAJCOM  assumes  responsibility  for  the  burden  of  providing  this training locally. Upgrade training will normally be accomplished at  the local  unit, however the FTU will still maintain a syllabus and capability to conduct upgrade training.  (T-2) 2.2.  Training Management: 2.2.1.  HQ AFGSC/A3BT in conjunction with HQ AFGSC/A3BA , HQ AFRC/A3T and HQ AFPC/DPAR,  determines  FTU  output  requirements  and  publishes  an  annual  schedule  of classes.  HQ  AFGSC/A3BA  is  responsible  for  initial  quota  assignments  and  manages  direct quota allocations and day to day adjustments. 2.2.2.  The  FTU  determines  the  annual  schedule  of  classes,  and  provides  qualification training IAW the appropriate course syllabus.  (T-2) 2.2.3.  Units  and  individual  crew  members  must  ensure  all  entry  prerequisites  and requirements  are  met.  Individuals  arriving  at  the  FTU  for  training  without  having  all prerequisites met or waived may be returned to their home station at their unit's expense.  (T-2) 2.2.4.  The  FTU  notifies  HQ  AFPC/DPAOC  (info  HQ  AFGSC/DPTTC/A3BT,  HQ AFRC/A3TT  if  applicable,  and  the  gaining  unit)  when  student  orders  need  to  be  extended beyond  the  established  graduation  date.  Units  will  ensure  student  temporary  duty  (TDY) orders authorize variations in itinerary (T-2) 2.2.5.  The FTU will provide the aircrew member with his/her completed training folder (to include  official  documentation  of  checkride  completion,  FTU  Student  Closeout  Training Report, and any other applicable waivers) to his/her gaining unit upon completion of training.   (T-3) 2.3.  Initial  Qualification  Training  (IQT).  Qualifies crew members in the B-52. Prerequisites and  time  limitations  are  listed  in  Air  Force  Education  and  Training  Course  Announcements (ETCA) URL: https://www.my.af.mil/etcacourses/default1.asp, and the B-52 IQT syllabi. 2.4.

Prerequisites  and  time  limitations  are listed in AFI 11-202V1, Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) and the B-52 TX syllabus. 18 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 2.4.2.  Individuals  requiring  requalification  training  may  not  be  assigned  to  RAP  CMR  or BMC until completion of MQT.  (T-2) 2.4.3.  (N/A AFRC)  Units will assign requalified crew members to an active flying position for a minimum of 18 months.  (T-2) 2.5.  Upgrade Training. 2.5.1.  Aircraft  Commander  Upgrade  Program  (ACUP)  Training.  Qualifies  current  B-52 pilots  as  aircraft  commanders.  Prerequisites  and  time  limitations  are  listed  in  Air  Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) and the B-52 ACUP syllabus. 2.5.2.  Pre-Crew  Flight  Instructor  Course  (CFIC)  training.    Once  identified  for  CFIC attendance through the TRB process,  training accomplished in  preparation for CFIC can be logged  for  currency  provided  the  training  is  performed  to  a  proficient  level  and  under instructor supervision. 2.6.  Instructor  Upgrade  (CFIC).  Prepares  unit  personnel  for  instructor  qualification.  CFIC attendance  is  a  prerequisite  for  flight  instructor  status.  Prerequisites  and  time  limitations  are listed in Air Force Education and Training Course Announcements (ETCA) and the B-52 CFIC syllabus.  Attending  another  aircraft's  instructor  upgrade  program  does  not  satisfy  B-52  CFIC requirements.  Failure  to  complete  the  initial  instructor  check  IAW  AFI  11-2B-52V2,  B-52 Aircrew  Evaluation  Criteria,  for  any  reason,  requires  appropriate  action  IAW  AFI  11-402, Aviation and Parachutist Service, Aeronautical Ratings and Badges; and AFI 11-202V2. 2.6.1.  Crew Flight Instructor Course-Academic Only (CFIC-A). CFIC-A is an in unit flight and simulator training course, with academics conducted at the FTU prior to conducting the flight portion. CFIC-A instructors will be designated IAW CFIC syllabus on their respective Squadron Letter of X.  (T-2) 2.6.2.  Once  identified  as  an  instructor  candidate,  training  accomplished  in  preparation  for, and  during  CFIC  can  be  logged  for  currency  provided  the  training  is  performed  to  a proficient  level.  Candidates  should  prepare  by  focusing  on  seat/crew  duties  of  lesser proficiency.  Other  pre-CFIC  syllabus  requirements  include  a  pre-CFIC  workbook  and  unit directed missions/events. (T-2) 2.7.  Faculty  Training  Course  (FTC).  An  FTU  program  designed  to  certify  B-52  instructors for  faculty  duties  in  the  FTU.  The  course  includes  academic  and  flight  training  to  prepare  an instructor  to  teach  in  an  FTU  environment.  The  FTU  SQ/CC  will  ensure  all  new  instructors  to the FTU complete FTC prior to instructing FTU students. Upon course completion and FTU/CC approval,  graduates  are  fully  qualified  as  FTU  flight  instructors  and  granted  the  T-prefix  (IPs may  have  to  complete  additional  training  before  instructing  students  in  the  block  1  phase  of training).  (T-1) 2.8.  Senior Officer Training: 2.8.1.  This  qualification  or  requalification  training  is  for  rated  colonel  selects  and  above (wing  commanders,  vice  wing  commanders,  operations  group  commanders  and  deputy commanders,  etc.).

Test Qualification.  49 TES/CC will ensure newly assigned aircrew members complete a unit-derived program to certify aircrew members as test qualified.  (T-2) 20 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 Chapter 3 MISSION QUALIFICATION TRAINING 3.1.  General.  Mission Qualification Training (MQT) upgrades newly assigned aircrew to BMC or CMR in order to accomplish the unit's missions. Guidance in this chapter is provided to assist the  unit  in  developing  its  MQT  program,  if  training  was  not  completed  at  the  Formal  Training Unit  (FTU).    Units  are  allowed  to  further  tailor  programs  for  all  aircrew  based  on  current qualification,  experience,  currency,  documented  performance,  and  formal  training.    Applicable portions of MQT may be used to create a requalification program for aircrew that regressed from BMC or CMR to specifically address deficiencies which caused regression.  All training events accomplished to the required proficiency level during syllabus directed training are creditable (if applicable) for MQT.  FTU syllabus items that have been waived will be accomplished prior to declaring the individual BMC or CMR.  (T-2) Those syllabus items requiring a grade of familiar may be waived by the WG/CC.  (T-3) 3.1.1.  Qualifications and flight evaluations may be accepted from other MAJCOMs, if they meet  the  gaining  MAJCOM  and  unit  standards  as  determined  by  the  SQ/CC.  Initial  CMR-N/C or BMC status requires appropriate MQT. 3.1.1.1.  Within  the  FTU,  MQT  is  established  upon  completion  of  the  Faculty  Training Course (FTC).  (T-3) 3.1.2.  Local MQT programs should consist of ground and flying training applicable to unit tasking.  Units  are  allowed  to  further  tailor  local  MQT  programs  for  all  aircrew  based  on current  qualification,  experience,  currency,  documented  performance,  and  formal  training. Upon  completion  of  conventional  training  the  crew  member  will  be  certified  CMR-C  or BMC-C  by  the  SQ/CC  and  upon  completion  of  nuclear  training  the  crew  member  will  be certified  CMR-N  or  BMC-N.  The  SQ/CC  will  certify  each  crew  member,  including  any restrictions, in appropriate written format (Letter of Xs, grade sheets, ARMS, etc.).  NOTE: Once  a  crew  member  is  assigned  CMR-C,  CMR-N,  BMC-C,  or  BMC-N,  he/she  will maintain  currencies  and  RAP  for  their  qualification/experience  tier  IAW  with  Chapter  5.  (T-2) 3.1.3.  MQT will be completed within the time specified by each MAJCOM below.  Training starts no later than 7 work days after the crew member reports to an operational squadron and has been cleared for flying duties.  For IQT/TX conducted in the operational squadron, MQT will start the first duty day after completion of qualification check. Training is complete upon SQ/CC certification to BMC or CMR.  MQT items may be taught concurrently with IQT/TX at the discretion of the unit.  (T-2) 3.1.3.1.  For  AFGSC,  MQT  will  be  completed  within  120  days.  Failure  to  complete training within specified time limit requires notification by OG/CC or above via MFR, to HQ AFGSC/A3B.  Memorandum will contain crew member's name, rank, crew position, reason for delay, planned actions to rectify, and estimated completion date.  (T-2) 3.1.3.2.  For  AFRC,  notify  the  HQ  AFRC/A3  and  NAF/A3  if  training  exceeds  120 calendar days.  (T-2) 3.1.4.  Certification: AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 21 3.1.4.1.  Nuclear mission certification will be accomplished during MQT, IAW AFGSCI 13-520V1,  Bomber  Nuclear  Training.    Failure  to  complete  conventional  MQT  will  not prevent  designation  as  Nuclear  CMR  (CMR-N).  Training  will  be  accomplished  within para.  3.1.3.1 and para.  3.1.3.2 timeline requirements.  (T-2) 3.1.4.2.  Conventional  certification  will  be  accomplished  during  MQT  IAW  the  training syllabus and local directives at the aircrew members gaining unit of assignment.  (AFRC: 120 days) Suggested briefing guide is in Attachment 3.  Training should address all unit tasked  mission  sets.    Conventional  Verification  Cycle  (CVC)  mission  briefing  will address a minimum of one mission set.  Each crew member will demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of the squadron's assigned mission to a formal board. Board composition will be  established  by  the  SQ/CC.    Desired  composition  is  SQ/CC  or  SQ/DO  (chairman), weapons  officer,  electronic  combat,  intelligence,  and  plans  representatives.  Failure  to complete  Nuclear  MQT  will  not  prevent  designation  as  Conventional  CMR  (CMR-C).  Training  will  be  accomplished  within  para.    3.1.3.1  and  para.    3.1.3.2  timeline requirements. (T-2) 3.1.5.  Training Restrictions. 3.1.5.1.  HHD/FLAG  missions.    Aircrew  members  should  have  completed  conventional MQT  to  occupy  a  primary  crew  position  during  conventional  HHD/FLAG  missions. However,  aircrew  members  in  MQT  status  may  fly  on  conventional  HHD/FLAG missions  but  MQT  will  not  take  place  within  the  exercise  area(s)/AOR/mission  event start  of  a  FLAG/HHD  sortie  nor  will  it  interfere  with  mission  accomplishment.    Only aircrew members who have completed nuclear MQT may occupy a primary crew position during  nuclear  HHD/FLAG  missions.  In  all  cases  crewmembers  must  be  qualified  and current on all events scheduled for the HHD/FLAG mission.  (T-2) 3.1.5.2.  Flight Surgeon Training.  IAW AFI 11-202V1 and AFI 11-202V2, give assigned and  attached  flight  surgeons  every  opportunity  to  fly  in  the  unit's  primary  mission aircraft.  Flight surgeons who are assigned to tactical units and who have not previously flown  the  unit-assigned  aircraft  will  accomplish  the  following  before  the  initial  flight briefing:    Aircraft  general  review,  hanging  harness  training  (as  applicable),  egress training,  protective  equipment  training,  and  crew  resource  management  (CRM)  training (one-time)  in  primary  assigned  aircraft.    The  flight  surgeon’s  first  flight  in  the  unit-assigned  aircraft  will  be  with  an  IP  and  may  be  flown  in  conjunction  with  any  other training  sorties.   The  briefing  and  sortie  will  emphasize  crew  coordination, communications and equipment, and instrument interpretation.  (T-2) 3.1.6.  Currency  and  frequency  dates  are  established  by  the  date  the  appropriate  event  was last accomplished to a proficient level, regardless of training status.  (T-2) 3.2.  Ground  Training.  Units are responsible for ensuring blocks of instruction covering areas pertinent to the mission are accomplished as determined by the SQ/CC.  Training accomplished during IQT may be credited towards this requirement.  Ground training should include all items in Aircrew Ground Training Requirements listed in the RTM plus the following: 3.2.1.  Unit tasking (T-2) 3.2.2.  Advanced  mission  planning  and  operational  techniques  (MGRS  grid/Lat-Long coordinate conversion, weapons effects, lessons learned, EDL, etc.).  (T-3) 22 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 3.2.3.  Special Operation Forces and Land Component introduction and coordination.  (T-3) 3.2.4.  Flash blindness protection.  (T-2) 3.3.  MQT Flight/Simulator Training.  Units will reference the B-52 training plan for items to accomplish  during  MQT.    All  items  that  are  required  for  MQT  will  be  completed  before declaring  an  individual  BMC  or  CMR.    Units  may  add  to  the  requirements  of  the  syllabus  to meet  individual  mission  requirements  and  to  prevent  regression  of  proficiency  gained  at  the FTU.  MQT missions should be designed with profiles typical of squadron missions.  (T-1) 3.4.  Transferring  Between  Units.  BMC  or  CMR  individuals  transferring  between  units  will complete  MQT  as  determined  by  the  gaining  unit  SQ/CC.    Training  should  be  based  on experience,  proficiency,  currency,  and  previous  formal  training  of  the  transferring  individual. BMC or CMR individuals transferring between units must complete the Unit Mission Briefing.  (T-2) AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 23 Chapter 4 WEAPONS DELIVERY/EMPLOYMENT QUALIFICATION 4.1.  General.  This  chapter  outlines  requirements  for  attaining  initial  qualification  and maintaining  continuation  training  (CT)  certification  for  CMR/BMC  Pilots/WSOs/EWOs  in  the employment of air-to-surface weapons. 4.2.  Initial  Qualification.  All  crewmembers must accomplish  initial  qualification in  unguided bombs,  LGB,  TGP  coordinate  generation,  JDAM,  WCMD,  CALCM,  JASSM,  MALD  and ALCM prior to the SQ/CC declaring that individual CMR/BMC. Any new weapon qualifications (IOC  after  crewmember  declared  CMR/BMC)  will  be  conducted  IAW  an  approved  AFGSC training plan. 4.2.1.  Initial Qualification Criteria.  4.2.1.1.  Must achieve a minimum of 3 valid attacks (IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot-Kill) 4.2.1.2.  For  IQT students, valid attacks accomplished after achieving a proficient  grade on that event may be credited towards initial qualification. 4.2.1.3.  Requires  that  a  qualified  instructor  of  like  specialty  monitor  crewmember mission planning and in-flight weapon delivery procedures (actual or simulated) during a sortie or WST.  Initial qualification is awarded if the planning and delivery requirements specified in  the weapon T.O. are  accomplished and the hit criteria are achieved (Actual releases  see  para    4.4/simulated  releases  use  AFTTP  3-1)  An  individual  who  graduates from  the  B-52  IQT  syllabus  may  meet  all  requirements  to  achieve  initial  weapon qualification; however, the intent is for that crewmember to be complete with WQT upon completion of MQT. 4.2.2.  Weapon training received during IQT or MQT may satisfy the requirements for initial weapon  qualification.  Initial  qualification  will  carry  over  for  crewmember  upgrades  if previously certified in the weapon type. If unqualified up to 39 months, initial qualification carries  over  from  previous  qualification.  If  unqualified  for  39  months  or  greater,  initial qualification must be re-accomplished. In either case CT certification still applies. 4.2.3.  Initial  Weapons  Qualification  Training.  Qualification  in  each  B-52  weapon  type requires academics, simulator training, and/or flight training. 4.2.3.1.  Academics. All aircrew members will accomplish initial academics prior to any flight/WST training. Emphasis will be: weapons characteristics, mission planning (JWS, IMEA, CWDS, PFPS, and UMPH/JMPS), preflight, programming, targeting, retargeting, release, crew coordination, and tactical employment. Academics will cover both normal procedures and abnormal procedures (e.g. malfunctions, jettison procedures, etc). 4.2.3.2.  Simulator training. The WST should be used to the maximum extent possible for all initial WQT. Emphasis of weapon qualification WSTs should be checklist procedures for normal and abnormal situations. Attaining proficiency in the WST is desired prior to flight  training.  WQT  should  focus  on  weapon  employment  during  appropriate  mission type. 24 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 4.2.3.3.  Flight  training.  WQT  flight  training  should  focus  on  tactical  employment  and crew coordination skills. Sortie profiles should emphasize targeting/retargeting command and control unique to the different mission types, and both pre-planned and multi-weapon dynamic targeting. For applicable weapons, demonstrate proficiency in multi-DPI (single target  with  multiple  DPIs),  and  multi-target  area  attacks  (multiple  targets  with  multiple DPIs). 4.3.  Continuation  Training  (CT)  Certification.  A  CT  certification  criterion  establishes  the minimum  standards  for  crewmembers  to  maintain  certification  in  the  appropriate  weapon delivery  events,  and  does  not  determine  evaluation  criteria  established  by  other  instructions, regulations, or agencies. 4.3.1.  CT  Certification  Criteria.  CT  certification  criteria  are  achieved  by  maintaining  a 75%hit rate for  guided  weapons  and  a 50% hit  rate  for unguided weapons, assessed during the  end  of  the  RAP  training  cycle.  Failure  to  certify  in  one  event  does  not  invalidate certification  in  the  other.  Overall  hit  percentages  for  guided  and  unguided  weapon certifications are calculated by dividing number of hits by number of attempts at the end of the training cycle. 4.3.1.1.  Guided Hit % = Guided Weapon Hits (RJ23) / Guided Weapon Attempts (RJ22) 4.3.1.2.  Unguided Hit % = Unguided Weapon Hits (RA71) / Unguided Weapon Attempts (RA70) 4.3.2.  Unit Responsibilities. Units will use all available means to accurately assess weapon delivery  effectiveness  for  each  bomb  run  during  the  mission  debrief.  AFTTP  3-1.Shot/Kill valid attack/kill criteria for simulated releases and/or range scoring for actual releases will be the primary methods for determining hit criteria. The intent is to ensure an adequate debrief is  accomplished  that  quantifies  and  records  weapon  delivery  effectiveness,  while  ensuring crewmembers remain certified to employ ordnance.  4.3.2.1.  Weapon Hit. A hit will be assessed for each bomb run where actual or simulated weapon(s)  are  delivered  against  the  correct  target  within  the  established  release  criteria (see para  4.4).  4.3.2.2.  Weapon Miss Assessment. A miss will be assessed for each bomb run where an aircrew error precludes an effective simulated or actual weapon(s) release (failure to open weapon  bay  doors,  delivery  outside  briefed  release  criteria,  wrong  target  coordinates entered into offensive avionics system (OAS) or premature safeing of the release system, etc.). 4.3.3.  CT Weapon Deliveries.  CT weapons deliveries will be deliveries simulating realistic employment of Unit Committed Munitions List (UCML) munitions considering such factors as  fuzing,  safe  escape/separation,  frag  deconfliction,  egress,  etc.  Actual  CT  air-to-surface weapons event requirements should be accomplished on scoreable tactical ranges as much as possible. To maintain a combat perspective in a peacetime environment, weapons deliveries should  simulate  realistic  employment  of  actual  munitions.  To  take  credit  for  a  CT  weapon delivery,  crewmembers  must  be  qualified  in  the  weapon  event  and  sitting  in  their  primary crew position. AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 25 4.3.4.  Failure  to  Maintain  Certification.  Failure  to  maintain  certification  in  one  event  does not  invalidate  certification  in  others.  SQ/CCs  may  declare  a  crewmember  uncertified  in  an event(s)  and  invalidate  all  previous  record  deliveries  for  that  event  at  any  time  during  a training  cycle  without  affecting  other  weapons  event  certifications.  The  crewmember  will revert to N-CMR/N-BMC and will remain in that status until achieving initial certification in the  deficient  event(s).  Crewmembers  failing  to  meet  required  guided  and/or  unguided weapons  hit  percentages  will  become  uncertified  in  that  event(s)  until  completion  of  a squadron directed recertification program.  4.3.5.  Continuation Training Certification Cycle. Weapon certification will be aligned with the  squadron’s  12-month  training  cycle.  At  the  end  of  the  training  cycle,  crewmembers’ weapons  delivery  scores  will  be  reviewed  to  assess  their  certification.  If  certified,  the crewmember’s certification is valid through the following training cycle. If a crewmember is determined  to  be  uncertified  for  that  training  period  he/she  must  complete  a  recertification program approved by the SQ/CC. 4.4.  Weapons  Delivery  Parameters.  The  following  event  descriptions  form  the  basic framework for aircrew  weapons delivery training  and all deliveries  will conform  to  the criteria established for each specific event. 4.4.1.  Synchronous/Streaming  Bomb  Run.  A  delivery  of  a  weapon  using  the  OAS  with inputs  to  the  INU  from  the  radar,  TGP,  or  GPS.  This  type  of  delivery  applies  to  unguided weapons. 4.4.1.1.  Low  Altitude  Delivery.  Minimum  run-in  altitude  is  safe  separation/escape/fuse arm for ordnance being delivered/simulated, aircrew minimum low altitude certification, or  range/target  area  restrictions,  whichever  is  higher.  Maximum  altitude  is  10,000  feet AGL.  Hit  criteria:  Actual  Release  -  350  feet.  Simulated  release  -  IAW  AFTTP  3-1.Shot/Kill 4.4.1.2.  Medium/High  Altitude  Delivery.  For  the  purposes  of  accomplishing  this  event, minimum  altitude  is  above  5,000  feet  AGL.  Hit  Criteria:  Actual  release  -  from  10,000 feet  AGL  up  to  but  not  including  25,000  feet  MSL  -  450  feet.  At  or  above  25,000  feet MSL - 550 feet. Simulated release - IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot/Kill 4.4.1.3.  LGB Delivery. An event in which the combat/training laser is employed to guide a simulated/actual LGB during a given delivery. Hit Criteria: Actual releases - 10 meters. Simulated releases - IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot/Kill. 4.4.2.  Guided Delivery (GD). A delivery of a weapon autonomously guided by an onboard GPS and/ or INS. 4.4.2.1.  JDAM  (Joint  Direct  Attack  Munition).  Actual  or  simulated  release  of  one  or more GBU-31s or GBU-38s.  Individuals must plan and execute delivery against a single target  or  a  target  set  to  ensure  weapon(s)  will  achieve  mission  objectives  and  weapon parameters.  Hit  Criteria:  For  actual  delivery  -  49  feet  (15m)  for  GPS  aided  and  98  feet (30m)  for  INS  only  (Where  the  GPS  is  updating  the  aircraft  but  not  the weapon  itself). For  simulated  delivery  -  effective  release  of  one  or  more  JDAMs  IAW  AFTTP  3-1.Shot/Kill. 26 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 4.4.2.2.  WCMD (Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser). Actual or simulated release of one or more CBU-103/104/105/107. Individuals must plan and execute delivery against a single  target  or  a  target  set  to  ensure  weapon(s)  will  achieve  mission  objectives  and weapon  parameters.  Hit  Criteria:  For  actual  delivery  -  100  feet  (30m).  For  simulated delivery – effective release of one or more WCMDs IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot/Kill. 4.4.2.3.  TGP  Coordinate  Generation  (TCG)  Hit  Criteria.  TGP  coordinate  generation solutions can be used to immediately update MIL-STD 1760 weapons solutions just prior to  release.  As  such,  the  WSO  must  demonstrate  the  required  skill-sets  to  accurately measure  a  specific  DPI  using  the  criteria  listed  in  AFTTP  3-1.B-52.  TCG  record measurements  should  be  taken  against  pre-planned,  mensurated  aimpoints/targets  to facilitate accuracy assessments. 4.4.2.4.  ALCM/CALCM (Conventional/Air  Launched  Cruise  Missile).Actual  or simulated  release  of  one  or  more  AGM-86B/C.    Individuals  must  plan  and  execute delivery  against  a  single  target  or  a  target  set  to  ensure  weapon(s)  will  achieve  mission objectives and weapon parameters. Hit Criteria: Effective release of one or more weapon within technical order parameters.  4.4.2.5.  JASSM  (Joint  Air-to-Surface  Standoff  Missile).  Actual  or  simulated  release  of one or more AGM-158. Individuals must plan and execute delivery against a single target or  a  target  set  to  ensure  weapon(s)  will  achieve  mission  objectives  and  weapon parameters. Hit Criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot/Kill. 4.4.2.6.  MALD/MALD-J  (Miniature  Air  Launched  Decoy-Jammer).   Actual  or simulated  release  of  one  or  more  ADM-160B/C.    Individuals  must  plan  and  execute delivery  against  a  single  target  or  a  target  set  to  ensure  the  expendable  (s)  will  achieve mission objectives and planned parameters. Hit Criteria: IAW AFTTP 3-1.Shot/Kill. 4.5.  Actual  Ordnance.  Actual  ordnance  training  is  essential  to  aircrew  combat  capability. Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  give  each  crewmember  the  opportunity  to  deliver  as  many types of weapons inventoried on the UCML as possible.  AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 27 Chapter 5 CONTINUATION TRAINING 5.1.  General.  This  chapter,  in  conjunction  with  the  current  B-52  RTM,  establishes  the minimum flying and related ground training requirements to maintain currency and qualification. The  unit  commander  is  ultimately  responsible  for  ensuring  crewmembers  receive  sufficient continuation  training  to  maintain  individual  proficiency.    Refer  to  Chapter  6,  Specialized Training, for additional training program specifics.  Crew members must be qualified IAW AFI 11-202V1,  AFI  11-202V2,  AFI  11-2B-52V2,  and  AFI  11-301,  AFGSCSUP,  Aircrew  Flight Equipment  (AFE)  Program,  AFI  16-1301,  AFGSCSUP,  Survival,  Evasion,  Resistance,  and Escape Program  (T-1) 5.1.1.  Intent.  Command intent is for training responsibility to reside at the lowest level, the individual,  and  be  overseen  at  successive  levels  (crew,  flight,  unit).    Wherever  practical, sorties  and  events  should  be  scheduled  and  managed  by  crew  versus  individual.    This  will facilitate  not  only  smoother  Training  and  Stan/Eval  operations  and  scheduling,  but  should enable  more  effective  tracking  and  monitoring  of  crew  events  and  currencies  by  the respective Aircraft Commanders (when applicable). 5.2.  Aircrew  Status.  B-52  crewmembers  are  assigned  Combat  Mission  Ready  (CMR),  Basic Mission  Capable  (BMC),  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  (BAQ),  or  Non-CMR/BMC  status. CMR/BMC are either nuclear or conventional, or both.  (T-2) 5.2.1.  Combat  Mission Ready  (CMR-N/C).    The  minimum  training  required  for  aircrew  to be  qualified  and  proficient  in  all  of  the  primary  missions  tasked  to  their  assigned  unit  and weapon systems.  5.2.2.  Basic Mission Capable (BMC-N/C).  The minimum training required for aircrew to be familiarized  in  all,  and  may  be  qualified  and  proficient  in  some,  of  the  primary  missions tasked to their assigned unit and weapon system.  5.2.3.  Basic  Aircraft  Qualification  (BAQ).  Requires  a  crewmember  to  satisfactorily complete initial qualification training and qualifies him/her to perform aircrew duties in the unit aircraft. 5.2.4.  N-CMR/N-BMC.    A  crewmember  that  is  unqualified,  non-current  or  incomplete  in required continuation training, or not certified to perform the unit mission. See para. 5.8 for specific  guidance  on  regression  or  re-certification  of  crewmembers  who  are  non-current  or incomplete in required continuation training. 5.2.5.  CMR,  BMC,  and  BAQ  crewmembers  must  accomplish  and/or  maintain  the requirements  in  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  this  volume  (for  their  respective  status)  and  the appropriate events in the ground and annual flying continuation tables in the RTM.  (T-1) 5.2.6.  FTU  Instructor.  FTU  instructors,  certified  via  the  in-house  Faculty  Training  Course (FTC) program (detailed in AFI 11-2B-52V1 para. 2.7 and applicable 307 OG OI guidance) must  maintain  BMC  for  Conventional  requirements.    See  Section  5.5  for  BMC  CT requirements.  (T-1) 5.3.  Aircrew Training Tiers. 28 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 5.3.1.  The  SQ/CC  designates  crewmembers  either  Inexperienced  or  Experienced,  based upon  minimum  accomplishments  in  the  RTM  and  the  commander’s  judgment.    RTM minimums are just that; progression from one level to the next is not automatic and is at the discretion of the SQ/CC once minimums are attained.  (T-3) 5.3.1.1.  Inexperienced.    A  crewmember  who  has  not  met  the  minimums  required  to become Experienced listed in the RTM. 5.3.1.2.  Experienced.  A crewmember who has met the minimums listed in the RTM, has completed  MQT  and  maintains  CMR/BMC  requirements  detailed  in  Section  5.5  of  this instruction, and who, in the commander’s judgment, exhibits a high degree of experience, professionalism,  and  proficiency  to  support  unit  missions.   Attainment  of  the prerequisites in the RTM does not guarantee automatic change in Tier.  All instructors are considered experienced.  (T-2) 5.3.1.3.  Core  Strike.    A  six-month  training  cycle  that  requires  inexperienced  or experienced  crewmembers  designated  by  the  SQ/CC  to  execute  nuclear  training  flights, simulators,  and  ground  events  monthly  to  increase  the  focus,  repetition  and  intensity  of nuclear  training.    This  will  allow  more  time  to  develop  robust  conventional  skills  for crewmembers during non-Core Strike cycles, giving commanders the flexibility to meet Combatant  Commander  and/or  exercise  tasks  and  training,  while  still  maintaining  a credible nuclear deterrent force. Note: While training event numbers are specified by the MAJCOM  in  the  RAP  Tasking  Message,  the  specifics  for  implementation  of  the  Core Strike concept  are outside the scope of this instruction and are specifically  delegated to 8AF/A3 for detailed guidance and execution at the Wing level and below. 5.3.2.  Change of Tier.  Aircrew tier changes should be assessed at periodic squadron TRBs (see  para. 1.5.4.5.1.).  When an individual changes Tier, currencies are creditable and new Tier  requirements  may  be  prorated.    See  para.    6.14  regarding  use  of  ATD  hours  toward change of tier.  (T-3) 5.4.  Training  Events/Tables  and  Credit.  Standardized  ARMS  training  event  identifiers  and descriptions can be found in Attachment 2.  Annual Training Period requirements are found in the  RTM.    Proration  of  training  information  can  be  found  in  Table  5.4  and  para.    5.8  of  this instruction.  (T-2) 5.4.1.  Crediting  Event  Accomplishment.  Crewmembers  may  credit  events  accomplished during  training,  MQT,  operational  missions,  and  satisfactory  evaluations  toward  currency requirements and establish a subsequent due date. They must be qualified in the events and either current or under the supervision of an instructor or squadron designated supervisor as described in paragraph 5.8.1.2.1. Use date of evaluation as the date of accomplishment for all flying  training  currency  events  that  were  trained  during  the  formal  course.  For  upgrade students  (not  initial  qualification  or  requalification  students),  continuation  training  events accomplished  during  upgrade  training  prior  to  the  evaluation  are  credited  towards  the requirements for the current crew position. Do not log training events for the upgrading crew position prior to the evaluation.  An individual who instructs a class receives credit for that academic training requirement.  Ground training accomplished during FTU/MQT/USAFWS may be credited toward CT requirements for the training cycle in which it was accomplished.  (T-2) AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 29 5.4.2.  For  an  unsatisfactory  flight  evaluation,  do  not  log  continuation  training  event  items graded unqualified (U) IAW AFI 11-2B-52V2 until re-qualified.  (T-2) 5.4.3.  Make-up  or  additional  training  (ground  or  flying)  is  creditable  towards  the  new training cycle. 5.4.4.  Instructors  and  flight  examiners  may  credit  50%  of  their  total  training  requirements while  instructing  or  evaluating.    Exception:  Instructor  and  Flight  Examiner  pilots  may  not credit any takeoffs, landings, or air-to-air refueling flown by another pilot.  Currencies must be updated in the seat.  The instructor must be current and qualified in the event in order to give instruction in that event.  (T-2) 5.5.  Continuation Training Requirements. 5.5.1.  Ground  Training.  Completion  and the responsibility  of  the  individual  crewmember.

(T-2) 5.5.2.1.  Failure to accomplish noted events in the RTM leads to non-CMR/BMC status. See para. 5.8. for regaining CMR/BMC.  (T-2) 5.5.3.  Unit programs.  The following programs comprise ground training only. Chapter 6 contains specialized programs with both flying and ground training requirements.  5.5.3.1.  Aircrew Training Device (ATD): 5.5.3.1.1.  The  RTM  depicts  the  minimum  ATD  training  requirements.  MAJCOMs will  determine  the  minimum  number/type  of  Aircrew  Training  Device  (ATD) missions  that  require  supervision.  Units  should  determine  additional  CT  training device supervision requirements based on expected employment tasking, and mission training objectives. ATD events that may be logged for currency are indicated in the RTM. (T-2) 5.5.3.1.2.  Simulator  Certification  (SIMCERT).    IAW  AFI  36-2251,  AFGSC/A3BT will  validate  SIMCERT  recommendations  and  update  creditable  events  in  the  RTM as necessary.  Checkride completion may be accomplished per AFI 11-2B-52V2 for events certified Code 1 through SIMCERT.  (T-2) 5.5.3.1.3.  Instructors are required for ATD training to be creditable when the aircrew member  requires  a  qualification.    See  para.    5.8.1.2.1  regarding  use  of  squadron supervisors to regain currencies.  (T-2) 5.5.3.2.  Conventional Verification Cycle (CVC) and Nuclear Mission Certification. 5.5.3.2.1.  CVC  provides  initial  MQT  aircrew  certification  and  updates  CMR  crew members on their conventional wartime mission.  Each crew member will participate 30 AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 in  a  CVC  every  18  months  as  a  briefer,  board  member,  or  seminar  participant.  Suggested briefing guide is in Attachment 3.  Each crew member will demonstrate to a formal  board a satisfactory  knowledge of the squadron's assigned mission.   Board composition  will  be  established  by  the  SQ/CC.    Desired  composition  is  SQ/CC  or SQ/DO intelligence,  and  plans representatives.    Crew  members  who  participate  in  any  unit  deployment  to  a  tasked theater of operations may receive credit for continuation verification.

At  least  one  SEPT  per  training  cycle  will  emphasize  the  intricacies and  difficulties  involved  with  heavy  gross  weight  takeoff  and  particularly  the dangers associated with aborting a takeoff at or near S1. (T-3) 5.5.3.6.3.  Each crewmember will accomplish SEPT by the last day of each calendar month. The currency will expire at the end of the following month.  Aircrew with an expired SEPT currency will be grounded until subsequently completed. SEPT will be included in aircrew GO/NO GO criteria.  NOTE: Crewmembers who are expired on SEPT will accomplish training for missed months prior to regaining currency. (T-2) AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 31 5.5.3.6.4.  Completion  of  a  WST  Emergency  Procedure  (EP)  profile  satisfies  the monthly SEPT requirement. 5.5.4.  FTU Instructor/340 WPS/49 TES/Flight Surgeon/Staff Guidance: 5.5.4.1.  FTU.  All FTU Instructors are Experienced BMC aircrew.  These instructors will accomplish BMC sortie totals and currency events IAW the RTM (proficiency events in the RTM will not be tracked).  Conventional BMC ground training IAW the RTM is also required.  (T-2) 5.5.4.2.  340  WPS  Instructor  and  49  TES.    Weapon  School  instructors  and  49  TES instructors  must  be  certified  to  perform  the  unit  mission  and  maintain  the  BMC currencies listed in the RTM.

Specialized  training  /certification  requirements  IAW  Chapter  6  and  applicable syllabi.  (T-2) 5.6.  Ancillary  Training.  Ancillary  Training  is  guidance  or  instruction  that  contributes  to mission accomplishment, but is separate from an Air Force Specialty or occupational series. AFI 11-2B-52V1  is  not  the  governing  directive  for  completion  of  ancillary  training  events.  In accordance  with  AFI  11-202V1,  the  source  AFI  provides  training  frequency  for  these  events unless an approved waiver has been authorized. See Unit Deployment Manger representative to ensure compliance with additional non-aircrew specific training requirements. AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 33 5.7.  Proration  of  Training.  AFI  11-202V1  describes  proration  of  training  requirements  for crewmembers not available for flying duties.  The SQ/CC may prorate all training requirements as  necessary  when  Duties  Not  Involving  Flying  (DNIFs),  emergency  leaves,  non-flying TDY/exercises,  combat/contingency  deployments,  and/or  (AFRC)  mandatory  training  required by  civilian  employment  preclude  training  for  a  portion  of  the  training  period.  Ordinary  annual leave will not be considered as non-availability.  Extended bad weather which precludes the unit from flying for more than 15 consecutive days may be considered non-availability. 5.7.1.  Use  this  formula  to  determine  training  requirements:  number  of  months  available times the event volume divided by the number of months in the training period. Round down to the nearest whole number (e.g. 5.6 rounds to 5), but not less than 1 unless the individual was available for less than 15 days during the SA period. 5.7.1.1.  Use  Table  5.1  to  determine  the  number  of  months  available.  Prorate  only  if absence is at least 15 cumulative days. typically  necessitate  use  of 5.7.1.2.  While  contingency  operations/deployments proration,  events  accomplished  during  the  deployments  may  be  credited  toward  annual training  cycle  event  requirements  (e.g.,  AR,  conventional  wpn  releases,  etc).    Events unable  to  be  achieved  (e.g.,  Flaps-up  approach,  etc)  may  still  be  prorated  per    5.7.1 above. 5.7.1.3.  ATD non-availability due to maintenance downtime or contingency deployments (e.g.,  CBP)  meets  criteria  for  proration.    Wings  should  plan  to  make-up  as  much  lost ATD  training  as  possible,  in  the  annual  cycle  either  before  or  after  scheduled deployments, with emphasis on ATD1/2/3/4 events (see RTM). (T-2) 5.7.1.4.  When an individual permanently changes station (PCS) during the training  and enters  the  same  training  tier,  credit  training  accomplished  at  the  previous  base.  Prorate training requirements based on the time available (e.g., time at former base, plus time at new base, minus number of days not available) during the training period. Time available starts  7-days  after  sign-in  or  on  the  date  of  actual  accomplishment  of  the  first  training event, whichever occurs first. Subtract previous accomplishments from the prorated total to determine remaining requirements. Table 5.1.  Proration Allowance.

Failure  to  Complete  Training  Requirements.  Declare  individuals  N-CMR/N-BMC  if they  fail  to  maintain  noted  flying  currencies  and  they  fail  to  complete  sorties,  ATDs,  or  noted annual flying/ground continuation training requirements from the RTM.  While N-CMR, aircrew may  perform  missions  (including  exercises  and  contingencies)  in  which  they  are  current, qualified,  and  proficient,  similar  to  BMC  aircrew.    The  squadron  commander  may  assign  an individual to N-CMR or supervised status at any time.  When this occurs, training flight will be notified in writing, and it will be documented in the TRB minutes. (T-1) 5.8.1.  Failure to Maintain Flying Currency 5.8.1.1.  Flight Training Currency. The RTM defines currency requirements for all B-52 crew  members.  Upon  completion  of  Qualification  Evaluation,  events  accomplished during  formal  training  (IQT,  RQT/TX,  ACUP,  NUP,  CFIC,  FTC,  and  SSC)  to  the proficient level may be used to establish currency dates for continuation training. (T-2) 5.8.1.2.  Loss of Currency. Place individuals non-current in one or more currency events in  supervised  training  status  for  that  event  and  declare  them  N-CMR/N-BMC  in  those unit  missions  requiring  that  event.  Crewmembers  are  “non-current”  the  following calendar  day  after  event  currency  expires  (i.e.,  a  crewmember  who  accomplished  a  60 day  currency  event  on  1  June  becomes  non-current  on  31  July).  Loss  of  currency prohibits  an  individual  from  accomplishing  unsupervised  in-flight  duties  in  the  non-current event(s). (T-2) 5.8.1.2.1.  Supervision  is  defined  as  a  current  and  qualified  instructor  of  like specialty.    In  addition,  Squadron  Commanders  may  designate  Experienced-tier aircrew as Designated Supervisors IAW AFI 11-202V1. Designation will be made in writing  (e.g.  Letter  of  X’s,  Training  Folder,  etc).  Aircrew  members  may  regain currencies  listed  in  the  RTM  by  demonstrating  proficiency  with  an  instructor  or Squadron  Designated  Supervisor  of  like  specialty  for  currencies  that  have  been expired for less than 6 months IAW AFI 11-202V1 para. 3.4.3.1. (T-2) 5.8.1.3.  Regaining Currency. 5.8.1.3.1.  Loss of Currency up to 6-Months. Accomplish training as directed by the SQ/CC  to  include  a  proficiency  demonstration  of  the  non-current  event  to  a  like specialty instructor or designated supervisor (see para.  5.8.1.2.1). (T-2) 5.8.1.3.2.  6 months through 1 year. Training as directed by the squadron commander. Individuals  need  to  requalify  only  in  events  required  by  their  training  level  (i.e.  to regain CMR, BMC or BAQ status). Flight evaluation by an evaluator is required only for non-current items. (T-2) 5.8.1.3.3.  1  year  through  39  months  at  the  end  of  a  non-flying  assignment  or  48 months  at  the  end  of  any  active  flying  assignment.  Complete  training  needed  to requalify  in  all  events  required  by  their  training  level  (i.e.  to  regain  CMR,  BMC  or BAQ status), additional training as directed by the squadron commander, and a flight evaluation.  Individuals  must  complete  the  formal  TX-3  course  at  the  FTU  prior  to training at the unit. (T-2) AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 35 5.8.1.3.4.  Over 39 months at the end of a non-flying assignment or 48 months at the end  of  any  active  flying  assignment  to  8  years.  Individuals  will  be  requalified  in accordance with Chapter 2 and the applicable syllabus. (T-2) 5.8.1.4.  Loss of/Requalification to Instructor Status. Instructors will be decertified if: 5.8.1.4.1.  They  fail  an  evaluation.  To  regain  instructor  status,  the  instructor  must successfully  complete  assigned  corrective  training  and/or  a  flight  evaluation  IAW AFI 11-202V2 and AFI 11-2B-52V2. (T-3) 5.8.1.4.2.  They  become  non-current  in  an  event/sortie  which  causes  removal  from CMR/BMC  status  and  the  SQ/CC  deems  that  loss  of  currency  is  of  sufficient importance to require de-certification. If the SQ/CC does not elect this option or if the instructor becomes non-current in events/ sorties which do not require removal from CMR/BMC  status,  instructor  status  may  be  retained,  but  the  instructor  will  not instruct in that event/sortie until the required currency is regained. (T-3) 5.8.2.  Failure  to  Complete  End-of-Year  Proficiency  Requirements.    Individuals  who  fail  to complete flight proficiency requirements at the funded RAP level listed in the RTM will be declared N-CMR/N-BMC the first day of the second month of the new training cycle. A get-well training plan must be approved by the OG/CC for crewmembers who achieve 80-99% of funded RAP  level  proficiency  requirements.  For  crewmembers who achieve 79% or less of their  proficiency  requirements  the  get-well  training  plan  must  be  approved  by  the  WG/CC. Upon  completion  of  the  approved  training  plan  the  crewmember  will  be  declared CMR/BMC.    Events  included  in  the  get-well  training  plan  are  creditable  towards  the  new training period. 5.9.  Requirements Before PCS Or TDY By Members On Active Flying Status.  See AFI 11-202V1.

Ground  Training  Requirements.  Ground  training  events  accomplished  in  one  training program,  and subsequently required for another training program,  need not  be re-accomplished unless  required  by  the  squadron  commander.  For  example,  conduct  of  flight  briefings accomplished  during  flight  lead  upgrade  training  is  creditable  to  simulator  instructor  checkout. Annotate  in  the  individual  training  record  when  event  was  initially  accomplished.  All  training should be accomplished within 120 days from start to squadron commander certification, unless otherwise specified by this instruction or another regulatory guidance.  (T-2) 6.2.  Flight  Lead  Upgrade  (FLUG).  IAW  OG  coordinated  Standardized  Training  Plan minimums.  SQ/CCs may add additional requirements at their discretion. (T-3) 6.3.  Mission Lead Upgrade Program (MLUG).  IAW OG coordinated Standardized Training Plan minimums.  SQ/CCs may add additional requirements at their discretion. (T-3) 6.4.  Mission Commander (MCC) Upgrade.  IAW OG coordinated Standardized Training Plan minimums.  SQ/CCs may add additional requirements at their discretion. (T-3) 6.5.  Night Vision Goggle Training (NVG):  IAW OG coordinated Standardized Training Plan minimums.  SQ/CCs may add additional requirements at their discretion.  (T-3) 6.6.  Pre-Deployment Spin-Up Training.  This training should be conducted prior to deploying in  support of contingency  operations (if time permits) or exercises.  340  WPS, is  exempt from completing this training when deploying to Nellis AFB or Minot AFB.  49 TES is exempt from this  training  when  deploying  to  Nellis  AFB,  Minot  AFB,  and  Edwards  AFB.  The  objective  of this training is to ensure the crew members' ability to conduct all missions in support of expected tasking.  Tasked units are responsible for contacting appropriate gaining command/operations to determine  expected  mission  tasking.    This  assures  the  responding  forces  are  prepared  for  the appropriate  tasking  and  allows  the  responding  OG/CC  to  tailor  this  training  for  the  theater, threat, and tactics for the assigned task.  The SQ/CC is then responsible to implement this spin-up, prosecute the required missions, and determine the specific requirements necessary to reach the  desired  level  of  proficiency.    Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  training  needed  for  missions  not accomplished  in  daily  operations.    This  training  will  be  conducted  IAW  all  applicable regulations.  (T-3) 6.6.1.  Ground  Training.    Units  will  brief  rules  of  engagement  (ROE)/training  rules, command  and  control,  engagement  authority  and  procedures,  special  instructions  (SPINs), airspace  restrictions,  unique  communications  requirements,  emissions  control  (EMCON) procedures, and theater order of battle.  Accomplish a review of the Foreign Clearance Guide for  the  unique  procedures  and  requirements  of  the  destination  country.    Additionally,  this training will include a discussion of the airfield description and operating peculiarities.  This review of the location's unique operational environmental features should include, but is not limited  to,  in-flight  procedures,  seasonal  weather,  other  unique  weather  phenomena,  wind shear  potential  and  characteristics  (i.e.,  sea  breeze  front,  low  altitude  jet  stream  potential, etc.),  airfield  restrictions,  taxi  routes,  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO) procedures, and operating data if available. Leverage the local/host weather flight and AFH 11-203, Volumes 1-2, Weather for Aircrews, for weather portions of this training. (T-2) AFI11-2B-52V1  6 NOVEMBER 2015 37 6.6.2.  Flying  Training.  Spin-up  training  will  be  tailored  to  ensure  all  deploying  crew members are proficient, current, and qualified in all expected mission tasking.  (T-2) 6.7.  Supervised  Activity  Certification:  .  The  procedures  listed  below  qualify  non-instructor    B-52  aircraft  commanders  to  supervise  unqualified/non-current  pilots  in  air  refueling.  Certification will be annotated on the Letter of Xs.  (T-2) 6.7.1.  An instructor pilot will fly with each aircraft commander prior to recommending him or  her  to  supervise  copilots  in  air  refueling.    The  squadron  commander  then  must  approve and  designate  these  aircraft  commanders  in  writing.    Aircraft  commanders  may  be  further certified to supervise any pilot in these events.  (T-3) 6.7.2.  AR supervision requirement only applies for pilots who have not been qualified in air refueling  IAW  AFI  11-2B-52V2  flight  evaluation  or  who  are  non-current  per  the  RTM.    If supervising a pilot who is qualified, but non-current in air refueling, the pilot will not log air refueling  on  the  mission  accomplishment  report  (MAR)  unless  under  the  supervision  of  a current and qualified Instructor Pilot.  (T-2) 6.8.  Pilot (P) Air Refueling Qualification. 6.8.1.  Pilots not qualified in air refueling during IQT may continue air refueling qualification training  at  SQ/CC  discretion.  Pilots  will  continue  training  IAW  the  PIQ  syllabus.    This  is documented on the training accomplishment  report  (TAR) and maintained in  the respective training folder.  For qualification, pilots must be declared proficient  IAW AFI 11-2B-52V2 spot or recurring flight evaluation.  Once qualified, pilots will maintain air refueling currency IAW the RTM.  (T-2) 6.8.2.  Document  the  pilot’s  status,  including  any  restrictions,  in  appropriate  written  format   (AF Form 8, Letter of Xs, grade sheets, AF Form 4348, etc.).  (T-2) 6.9.  Dual Seat Qualification. 6.9.1.  This  program  is  to  be  used  for  training  non-previously  right-seat  qualified  Aircraft Commanders to right seat mission ready status.  Currency can be maintained and annual RAP training  events  can  be  logged  from  either  seat.    A  dual  seat  qualified  AC  must  accomplish recurring qualification checks IAW AFI 11-2B-52V2.  (T-2) 6.9.2.  Dual seat qualification training requirements will be accomplished from the right seat.
