SCOPE:    This  Air  Force  TTP  describes  command  and  organizational  relationships,  execution  using functional capabilities, and training requirements to conduct effective CTO.  While these TTP principles are focused on expeditionary operations in high threat locations, the tactical doctrine principles remain the same for home-station operations.  AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 2  COUNTERTHREAT OPERATIONS (CTO) OVERVIEW Chapter 1  1.1.  Overview.  AFMD-39, Air Force Office of Special Investigations, directs AFOSI to find, fix, track, and neutralize enemy threats in order to create a sustained permissive environment for air, space, and cyberspace operations.  AFOSI utilizes its five core capabilities in support of this mission directive.    These  are:    Detect  and  Mitigate  Threats;  Engage  Foreign  Adversaries  and/or  Threats Offensively; Conduct Major Criminal Offense Investigations; Provide Global Specialized Services; and Protect  Critical  Technologies  and  Information.    CTO  are  intelligence-driven  operations  employing information  derived  from  multiple  intelligence  and  counterintelligence  sources.    These  operations provide  commanders  tactical  situational  awareness,  drive  force  protection  conditions,  and  forewarn  of possible attacks.  AFOSI operational activities seamlessly collect, fuse, and disseminate relevant threat information  from  a  broad  array  of  sources  on  a  continual  basis.    Successful  CTO  execution  requires strong collaboration and coordination between AFOSI personnel and direct action forces to effectively neutralize  enemy  threats.    Within  the  US  Air  Force,  AFOSI  executes  CTO  by  integrating  all  AFOSI capabilities into the Air Force "kill chain" cycle to achieve the desired effects.  CTO tactical doctrine is a compilation of knowledge and expertise and describes the appropriate AFOSI role in integrated defense (ID) in hostile, uncertain, and permissive environments.    1.1.1.    The  following  activities  are  conducted  in  support  of  CTO;  counterintelligence  (CI) collections,  analysis,  investigations,  offensive  and  defensive  CI  operations,  law  enforcement activities, evidence collection, liaison, threat detection, functional services such as technical services, polygraph,  clinical  psychology,  protective  service  operations  (PSO),  surveillance,  counter-surveillance, surveillance detection, tactical debriefing, field interviews, and defensive capabilities in cyberspace.  1.1.2.  CTO Planning.  AFOSI units should develop effective CTO plans to support an effects-based approach  to  operations  (EBAO).    “An  effects-based  approach  to  military  operations  means  taking action  against  enemy  systems  so  as  to  create  specific  effects  that  contribute  directly  to  desired military  and  political  outcomes.”  Defining  the  battlespace  environment  is  critical  to  conducting successful  CTO  (i.e.,  Intelligence  Preparation  of  the  Battlefield  (IPB)).    CTO  plans  consist  of,  but are  not  limited  to,  a  unit’s  mission,  map  layout  illustrating  areas  of  concern/areas  of  influence, focused collection requirements, identified threats, and potential adversary courses of action (COA).  1.1.3.  CTO Training. Conducting CTO missions can be inherently dangerous.  For this reason, all efforts  should  be  made  to  maximize  training.    Training  is  key  to  mission  effectiveness.    Effective ground  combat  skills  are  imperative  to  survival  in  hostile  or  uncertain  environments.    Initial  and  recurring field training on perishable skills is vital.   1.1.3.1. The USAFSIA CTOC trains AFOSI agents in realistic scenarios to perform in high-risk locations more efficiently and effectively.  This training is a team-centered, operationally intense,  execution-based  immersion  course  designed  to  train  agents  in  core  deployment skills.    Curriculum  focuses  on  perishable  skill  sets  used  in  hostile  or  non-permissive environments.    Prior  to  a  contingency  deployment  or  assignment,  all  military  and  civilian AFOSI  personnel  are  required  to  attend  mandatory  advanced  training,  in  accordance  with AFI 10-403 AFOSI Supplement – Operations, Deployment Planning and Execution. AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 3 Chapter 2  ORGANIZATION AND COMMAND RELATIONSHIPS 2.1.  Organization.  AFOSI prepares and organizes combat-ready forces to meet the needs of the Air Force.  This implies a high level of training, flexibility in organization and equipment, and professional leadership.  Although a standard force structure is not realistic for all contingencies, a deployed AFOSI force  should  have  the  following  elements  to  effectively  conduct  CTO  in  concert  with  Service  or  joint command goals and objectives.   2.1.1.    Leadership.    Deployed  AFOSI  expeditionary  leaders  report  directly  to  the  senior  agent deployed who is part of the COMAFFOR staff.  2.1.2.  Special Agents.  Deployed AFOSI expeditionary leaders normally ensure that deployed agent personnel have the requisite pre-deployment training to conduct CTO activities.    2.1.3.    Special  Agent  Specialists.    Some  AFOSI  personnel  have  received  specialized  training  and perform a specialized mission.  Deployed AFOSI expeditionary leaders usually organize and deploy specialists such as polygraph examiners, technical service technicians, computer crime investigators, case officers, and forensic science consultants to maximize combat effectiveness.  2.1.4.    Administrative  Support.    Deployed  administrative  personnel  normally  have  the  requisite training and security clearances to conduct support functions (office management, human resources, executive  support,  postal/official  mail,  commander  programs,  and  limited  client  level  IT  support) that enable the AFOSI unit or personnel to conduct the CTO mission.   2.1.5.  Tactical Security Elements (TSE).  Freedom of movement is crucial to conducting successful CTO.  In hostile and some uncertain environments, AFOSI units and personnel should conduct CTO with  dedicated  security  elements.    A  TSE  is  a  squad-size  element  that  provides  the  capability, equipment, and firepower to travel independently of other ground maneuver units.  Forces for TSE may come from organic AF units or may be provided by other service or coalition forces.  2.1.6.  Analysts.  AFOSI units should have embedded analysts with the requisite skill and training to analyze  enemy  threats.    AFOSI  embedded  analysts  should  continuously  gather  and  fuse  relevant threat  information  from  a  broad  array  of  sources.    CI  analysis  helps  focus  collection  and  targeting activities.   2.1.7.  Linguists.  AFOSI units should have embedded linguists, specializing in the languages spoken in  the  operational  environment.      The  linguists  should  be  vetted  and  have  appropriate  security clearances.  Linguists should be employed at the lowest category to provide appropriate support.  2.2.  Command Relationships.  AFOSI Commanders maintain command and control over those forces assigned or attached to an AFOSI unit.  Command relationships in a joint environment for AFOSI operations are derived  from  Joint Publications  (JP)  1,  Doctrine  for  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States;  JP 2-01.2, Counterintelligence and Human Intelligence Support to Joint Operations; JP 3-07.2, Antiterrorism; and JP 3-10,  Joint    Security  Operations  in  Theater.    Command  authority  for  AFOSI  forces  conducting  CTO  is delegated  from  the  Joint  Force  Commander  (JFC),  through  the  commander  of  Air  Force  forces (COMAFFOR),  to  the  designated  senior  agent  deployed.    Administrative  control  (ADCON)  for  AFOSI forces remains within the Air Force chain of command at all times. See Figure 2.1. AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 4 2.2.1.    The  COMAFFOR  exercises  operational  control  (OPCON)  over  AFOSI  CTO  activities supporting force protection (See Figure 2.1) via the designated senior agent deployed.  The Secretary of the Air Force retains responsibility for law enforcement, CI investigations, and associated matters, and exercises this responsibility through the Commander, AFOSI.  In the case of forces attached to another  Service  to  act  in  lieu  of  (ILO)  that  Service’s  forces,  OPCON  may  be  delegated  to  the  Air Force commander holding OPCON over all ILO forces.  2.2.2.    AFOSI  personnel  not  attached  to  an  Air  Expeditionary  Task  Force  (AETF)  who  are performing the CTO mission in a Joint Operational Area (JOA) are normally under the operational control  of  the  AFOSI  senior  agent  deployed  (e.g.,  personnel  providing  support  to  a  contingency response group/contingency response element). 2.2.3.  When the Air Force is the force providing TSE support to AFOSI, tactical control (TACON) of  a  TSE  is  assigned  to  the  supported  AFOSI  detachment  commander  or  Special  Agent-in-Charge (SAIC)  via  the  AFOSI  senior  agent  deployed.    This  ensures  continuity  of  mission  execution  and operational  security.    The  SFS  Commander  retains  OPCON  and  ADCON  of  TSE  personnel.   TSE supported missions must be jointly planned by AFOSI and TSE personnel to identify the objectives and  evaluate  risks  associated  with  the  proposed  operation.    Conflicts  are  normally  resolved  by  the installation-level  AFOSI  and  SFS  commanders.    During  mission  execution,  the  TSE  patrol  leader has  TACON  of  the  security  mission  to  include  directing  convoy  operations  to  and  from  the objective,  as  well  as  directing  combat  operations  if  the  convoy  comes  under  attack.    The  senior AFOSI special agent on the mission has TACON of operational CTO activities.  Figure 2.1.  Command Relationships (JP 1).   2.2.4.  AFOSI detachment commanders or SAICs normally coordinate their unit’s CTO activities in hostile and uncertain environments  with the appropriate base operations center (e.g., Base Defense Operations  Center  (BDOC),  Tactical  Operations  Center  (TOC),  Battle  Space  Owner,  etc.)  and maintain communications with that element to facilitate freedom of movement, unity of effort, and  AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 5 safety  of  forces.    AFOSI  personnel,  when  operating  in  a  joint/combined  environment,  must understand the rules of engagement (ROE), or the Rules for the Use of Force (RUF) established by the joint force commander.    AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 6 Chapter 3  CTO EXECUTION CYCLE 3.1.  The  CTO  Execution Cycle.    Air  Force  CTO  contributes  to  a  keen  awareness  of  the  operating environment including Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB), and it incorporates the full range of  functions/activities  (figure  3.1)  AFOSI  uses  to  find,  fix,  track  and  neutralize  the  enemy.    CTO activities help create a sustained permissive environment for air, space, & cyberspace operations.  CTO capabilities  are  widely  variable  depending  on  their  application  combined  with  the  prevailing  threat, threat  state,  environment,  friendly  forces  available,  ROE,  RUF,  applicable  laws,  and  other  factors  that characterize an operational area.  The following sections define the CTO execution cycle.   Figure 3.1.  The Counterthreat Operations Umbrella.           AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 7  3.2.  The five phases of the CTO Execution Cycle:  Find, fix, track, neutralize, and assess.  3.2.1.    Find.    The  find  phase  requires  clearly  designated  guidance.    This  guidance  is  typically provided  via  established  Priority  Intelligence  Requirements  (PIR)  and  associated  collection requirements.  These requirements drive CI collection planning and operations.  CI collections lead to the detection of current and emerging targets.  Tailored all-source analysis drives and focuses CI collections activities.  AFOSI personnel should be familiar with the multiple targeting cycles present in a joint/combined operating environment.   3.2.1.1.    In  all  situations,  including  time  sensitive  targeting  (TST),  AFOSI  forces  conducting CTO  do  not  engage  in  direct  action  activities.    Instead,  AFOSI  provides  information  to  direct action units or operations centers.  3.2.2.    Fix.    The  fix  phase  uses  analysis  and  prioritization  to  determine  if  an  emerging  target  is worthy of engagement.  It may begin when an emerging target is detected or soon thereafter.  When an  emerging  target  is  detected,  sensors  (human  source  networks,  ISR  platforms  such  as  the Predator/Reaper), liaison, specialist activities, and information operations are focused to confirm the target’s  identity  and  precise  location.    Target  location  and  other  information  must  be  accurately refined to permit tracking and neutralization.  The completion of the fix phase results in a confirmed target with a designated CTO named operation.     3.2.3.    Track.    Tracking  is  done  with  the  initiation/continuation  of  specific  and  directed  CI collection  and  investigative  activities.    Tracking  is  also  accomplished  with  the  employment  of specific  ISR  platforms.    Information  obtained  during  this  phase  is  compiled  and  documented  in  a comprehensive target package.  3.2.4.    Neutralize.    The  neutralize  phase  begins  after  collected  information  is  determined  to  be credible.    Actionable  intelligence  or  a  comprehensive  target  package  may  be  provided  to  a  direct action authority for neutralization of the threat.  AFOSI activities in this phase may include:  positive identification  (PID),  surveillance  (physical,  technical  or  both),  apprehension  (during  criminal investigations), recruitment, influence operations, computer network exploitation, and dissemination of  actionable  intelligence  to  direct  action  units  to  support  exploitation,  seizure,  sensitive  site exploitation, cordon and search, detention, or capture/kill operations.     3.2.4.1.    In  hostile  and  uncertain  environments,  AFOSI  normally  coordinates  with  maneuver units  within  the  battlespace  for  target  package  execution.    Following  the  execution  of  a  CTO target package, AFOSI special agents may participate in site exploitation (search).  Additionally, special  agents  should  participate  in  and/or  contribute  to  tactical  questioning  and  document exploitation efforts. 3.2.5.    Assess.    Tactical  assessments  determine  the  effectiveness  of  executed  CTO  activities.    The principal question answered during the assess phase is whether desired effects and objectives were achieved.    In  cases  of  fleeting  targets,  quick  assessments  may  be  required  in  order  to  make expeditious re-attack recommendations.        AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 8 3.3.  Reporting.    CTO  reports  contribute  to  commanders’  overall  awareness  of  the  operational environment.    AFOSI  reports  normally  are  disseminated  to  the  intelligence  and  law  enforcement communities, as appropriate, at all levels and during all phases of the CTO cycle.  These reports include but  are  not  limited  to  suspicious  incident  reports  (SIRs),  intelligence  information  reports  (IIRs), comprehensive target packages, analytical products, spot reports, etc.    AFTTP 3-10.3    25 AUGUST 2015 9 Figure 3.3.
