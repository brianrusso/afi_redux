SUMMARY OF CHANGES 2.18.2.1.1.  Transaction Processing. Transaction Groups are created and maintained by the AFMC Information Technology Activity based on input from AFMC Information Technology Activity and  MAJCOM  staffs.    HAF/A4LM  is  the  final  approval  authority.    HAF/A4LM  will  gather feedback from the MAJCOMs and make the approval decision.  Final approval will be sent from HAF/A4LM to the AFMC Information Technology Activity for action.  The AFMC Information Technology Activity will send a RAPCOM to the field to notify all users of the changes once the update  is  made  in  ILS-S.    The  AFMC  Information  Technology  Activity  Program  Manager  or designated representative will conduct a review of the transaction groups each April.  The results of this review will be documented by memorandum to document the review was conducted, the HAF/A4LM  approval/disapproval  and  detail  any  changes  made  to  the  ILS-S.    The  AFMC Information Technology Activity Program Manager or designated representative will ensure the results are kept under configuration management for seven years.  Due to the limited number of Transaction Groups available in ES-S, some Transaction Groups may provide more transaction capability than required for an individual user. For example, a user may require access to ISU and DOC but these transactions may be bundled with DIT in a particular Transaction Group (because the majority of user’s require these transactions together). Any user assigned this group would also receive  the  ability  to  process  DIT  (against  all  DoDAACs  the  user  has  the  Transaction  Group assigned to). If a specific ES-S Transaction Group is not available to match the individual’s needs then  administrators  will  either  assign  a  lesser  Transaction  Group  (restricting  use)  or  a  more comprehensive Transaction Group and direct the individual not to process the type of transaction in question (for example, the DIT in the example above). If the individual abuses the privileges then  the  authorization  or  transaction  group  will  be  removed.  Users  are  responsible  for  any transactions and rejects they create using ES-S. ES-S includes an Audit Trail Component (ATC that records all transactions initiated through ES-S and links the transactions to a specific Portal ID. The ATC can be used to determine the source of SBSS transactions/rejects initiated through ES-S.    Further  information  on  ES-S  transaction  processing  can  be  found  in  the  ES-S  Users’ Manual.  Chapter 1— GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  1.1.

For example, while the term Defense Logistics Agency Distribution Service (DLADS) has replaced the term Defense Reutilization & Marketing Office (DRMO), the older term is still used for  operational  reference  when  showing  system  output.    The  term  has  intentionally  not  been updated because system users will encounter the older terminology in their interaction with SBSS. 1.2.  Relationship to Other Publications.  The provisions of this part will be used in conjunction with applicable procedures in other official publications, for materiel management data processing system management.  In cases where conflicting policy or procedures exists, identify these issues to AF/A4LM for resolution. 1.3.  Objective.  The  objective  of  this  part  is  to  provide,  through  systematic  management procedures: 1.3.1.  Effective,  standard,  and  controlled  automated  data  processing  (ADP)  support  for Logistics Readiness Squadron (LRS) / Materiel Management Activity operations. 1.3.2.  Standard data processing system fundamentals, work processes, and methodology, for the training, development, and maintenance of functional ADP LRS / materiel management activity personnel. 1.3.3.  Accurate  and  timely  SBSS  ADS  prepared  management  and  operational  products  for LRS / Materiel Management Activities. 1.4.  Reference Information.  Users are encouraged to refer to Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 for  reference  information  as  well  as  identification  of  legacy  AF  supply  chain  functions  with updated terminology. 1.4.1.  The Integrated Logistics System-Supply (ILS-S) system is the overarching term used to describe  the  system(s)  used  by  base  retail  materiel  management  operations.  The  ILS-S  is comprised  of  the  SBSS,  Enterprise  Solution  –  Supply  (ES-S),  and  the  Air  Force  Supply Centralized Database (AFSCDB).  In many cases the term  ILS-S is used to identify system related functions/references.  Where applicable, in some instances, specific identification of SBSS or ES-S is used for more detailed identification. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 65 Chapter 2 AFMC SCM-R INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITY PROCESSES Section 2A—-Standard Supply Programs and Documentation 2.1.  Overview.  This  section  provides  general  and  specific  procedures  for  distribution  and processing  of  programs  and  documentation.    All  programs    are  provided  on  magnetic  tape  by AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity.    Specific  processes  applicable  to  special purpose and utility programs/runstreams are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6.  Specific processes for report programs are contained in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 & 6.  Notes:    1.  Even  though  Standard  Procurement  System  (SPS)  has  taken  over  Base  Contracted  Automated System (BCAS) functions, the BCAS flag fields and coding terms will remain the same.     2.  The term  Defense  Business  Operations  Fund  (DBOF)  is  now  the  Defense  Working  Capital  Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever DBOF  is used in a systems output, the older term is used to reflect the actual output.  The term will be updated upon system programmatic updates. 2.2.  Types of Programs. 2.2.1.  Systems Support.  Programs which establish and provide the operating environment for the SBSS/ADS are designated as systems support.  These programs preposition the required constant/variable data in memory initialization; provide input/output capability via drivers for peripherals and communications subsystem; contain common subroutines such as DMSCALC (a system-provided randomizing algorithm), locate detail, decimal to binary/binary to decimal conversion; and allow for the orderly restore of records updated by transactions subsequently rejected. 2.2.2.  Application.  Programs loaded to the program bank except system support and utility are designated as application.  Application programs are called into memory to process specific inputs, produce reports, or other off-line products.  Application programs perform input edits, make processing decisions, produce the memory buildup to change records, create transaction histories, output document and images.  Interface with system support routines is accomplished to perform the input/output functions and access common subroutines. 2.2.3.  Utility.    Self-contained  programs,  working  independently  of  the  system  support,  are designated  as  utility.    Utility  programs  are  documented  in  Ch  16.    The  program  numbers NGV001 through NGV099 correspond to the paragraph containing the operating instructions.  Most utility programs are self-adjusting and function as directed by the parameters provided. 2.3.  Distribution of Programs and Documentation. 2.3.1.  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Release Tapes.  Program release tapes are mailed directly to each Defense Mega Center (DMC) computer site from AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Release Control.  If the release is small, less than 4000 tracks, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity electronically sends the release to the DMC sites.  Each release is numbered chronologically.  Should a release be received with a date prior to the most recent release, notify the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Field Assistance Branch (FAB) immediately. 2.3.2.  Receipt  of  Release.    Upon  receipt  of  the  program  release  from  AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity, the SBSS monitor at the DECC will copy the new software AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 66 and produce a listing of the program changes affecting the SBSS which includes rationale and DIREP information. The SBSS monitor will forward the listing and all special instructions to the  RPS  operator,  who  will  in  turn  provide  a  copy  to  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality  Assurance Activity,  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service,  and  satellite  accounts,  if  applicable."  Computer  Operations  will  review  the  AF  Form  636,  Systems  Change  Release  Document, rationale  record  for  any  special  instructions  that  apply  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity.  The release contains a brief resume of the program changes and advance documentation when required.  Advance documentation serves as interim procedures and is effective  until  procedures  can  be  published.    In  conjunction  with  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality Assurance Activity (host and satellites), the supply systems monitor will review the rationale portion of the AF Form 636 for software changes to determine the impact to the SBSS.  AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity with the input from the Functional Systems Management (LGLOS)  will  coordinate  with  all  affected  branches  and/or  organizations  to  ensure  the procedural changes and implementation instructions are thoroughly understood.  This may be accomplished by a formal meeting or a written summary.  The supply systems monitor will coordinate with AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity and the DMC/SBSS monitor to determine the date the programs  will be loaded on the DMC.   It  is  the responsibility of the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisor to ensure all special instructions have been completed successfully before allowing any users to access the SBSS.  Computer Operations must coordinate with the appropriate management office of each affected account on the changes received to ensure a compatible and correct operation.  The LGLO, or other appropriate  management  office  of  each  automated  account,  is  responsible  for  timely distribution of advance documentation and instructions to affected sections of the account for proper implementation.  A release number is assigned to each group of DMC SBSS Automated Data  System  (ADS)  programs  released  to  provide  proper  documentation  control  and  for reference use between bases and AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  Release numbers  are  constructed  and  assigned  as  follows.    All  releases  will  be  loaded  under  strict timeframes.  The following illustrates the timeframes to load the applicable releases: Table 2.1.  Release Timeframes. RELEASE LOADED WITHIN LOAD UPON RECEIPT 72 hours of receipt EMERGENCY RELEASE 24 hours of receipt OPR EFFECTIVE After completion of end of month 2.3.3.  Air Force-Wide Releases.  Air Force-wide operational programs are used at all bases and are modified/enhanced by release software.  The releases can be either routine or special and are identified by assigning an alphanumeric designation to each release (e.g., R970701).  The seven-digit number is assigned as follows:  (a) R/S indicates the type of release as either routine (R) or special (S), (b) YYMM indicates the two-digit year and the two-digit month, and  (c)  SN  indicates  the  sequence  number.    (Note:    All  block  releases  start  with  sequence number 01.) 2.3.3.1.  Special  Releases:    Emergency  releases  are  generated  as  required  and  released through AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity with a higher priority.  Quality AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 67 Test & Evaluation Phase II (QT&E II) releases are made as required and are sent to specific bases for testing purposes.  QT&E II release numbers begin with a T. 2.3.3.2.  Documentation Releases: 2.3.4.  Computer Operations Actions for Air Force-Wide Releases. 2.3.4.1.  All AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity/main site operators will read and electronically sign each release. 2.3.4.1.1.  Step 2  -  Immediately after loading a program  release, the AFMC SCM-R 2.3.4.2.  Information  Technology  Activity  operator  will  print  a  current  listing  of  the program  bank.    Process  the  Program  Bank  Index  (PBI)  by  entering  the  following command: 2.3.4.2.1.  @START 0GV00000*DBWORK.PBI 2.3.4.3.  This PBI listing will be stored electronically.  The following runstreams must be executed  every  time  a  new  program  release  provided  by  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity for the SBSS is uploaded.  Each of these runs must be processed by Gang 1 of each unique access location number (ALN). 2.3.4.3.1.  @START 0GV00000*DBWORK.CREATE/GVEXECUT001            Note 1 2.3.4.3.2.  @START 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC                Note 2  Notes:  1.  This run saves all Exempt files for all ALN accounts.    2.  This run saves ALN unique user files. 2.3.5.  AF Form 636.  This listing will contain the AF Form 636 and the applicable rationale list  pertaining  to  the  specific  release  and  will  be  used  to  control  the  application  of  ADS programs in the SBSS operation.  This file will be organized and maintained as follows: 2.3.5.1.  AF  Form  636  program  release  listing  and  applicable  rationale  list  for  released software are maintained in release number sequence. 2.3.5.2.  Current  block  release  (designated  by  an  R  in  the  first  position  of  the  release number) and two previous block releases to include all special (designated by an S in the first position of the release number) releases.  To further clarify:  (a) current block release and all special releases following it; (b) first previous block release and all special releases following it; and (c) second previous block release and all special releases following it. 2.3.5.2.1.  For baseline releases, the AF Form 636 and rationale listings will be held until  a  new  baseline  is  received.    Baseline  releases  will  be  identified  in  the documentation accompanying the release. 2.3.6.  Computer Operations Actions.  Computer Operations should ensure the following steps are completed each time a program release tape is received/loaded: 2.3.6.1.  Step  1  -  Arrange  a  meeting  with  the  DMC/SBSS  monitor,  discuss  any  special instructions included on the AF Form 636, and develop a plan of action.  Agree upon the time and date to load the release. 2.3.6.2.  Step 2 - Have knowledgeable personnel on duty during the load of the release to correct/resolve problems if they should arise. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 68 2.3.6.3.  Step 3 - Ensure all gangs are in the proper posture to load software.  Also, ensure all gangs have been properly dumped.  When all databases are in proper posture, the AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  operator  should  notify  the  DMC  operator  to down the ADS through security and to load the new software. 2.3.6.4.  Step 4 - Resume normal processing when these steps have been completed. 2.4.  Phrase Records.  The term Phrase Records applies to reject notice, transaction, cargo, and exception phrase records. 2.4.1.  Reject/management phrase load file 0GV00000*REJNOT. is required to establish the reject notice record which provides a plain language phrase that identifies specific errors in an input.  Each base will be furnished a complete file at the time of conversion and any changes, additions, or deletions will be furnished by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity as required.  These phrases will not be changed at base level.  Para. 2.130 contains the input format, and AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8, lists current phrases used in the SBSS.  A hash total  is  computed  on  all  reject  phrase  load  inputs.    This  is  done  to  ensure  the  action  and supplemental data location flags are correct.  The flags control internal program decisions that could affect the validity of the account. 2.4.2.  Type  transaction  phrase  load  file  contain  phrases  which  print  out  to  further  identify specific transactions appearing on document and transaction registers.  The Type Transaction Phrases and Codes (TTPC) are loaded to the database record area (DBRA) by processing TPH load inputs (see Para 2.130 for input format).  A current listing of type transaction codes and abbreviated  phrases  are  shown  in  AFH  23-123,  Vol  1,  Ch  2.    AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity will prepare load inputs to update database records as applicable, using the above referenced areas for format and current phrase data.  If it is necessary to delete a phrase, an input is processed as a load with the phrase not used.  Type cargo and exception phrase records are loaded as outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8.  Phrase load inputs must be processed through the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity pseudo reader before any users can access the SBSS database.  The only outputs furnished are reject notices in  the  event  of  error  conditions.    If  an  error  condition  occurs,  a  printout  of  the  appropriate database record area should be made and compared against the current listing of phrases in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2.  An input load image should be processed to correct any erroneous phrase in the DBRA.  When multiple errors are detected, or the DBRA appears garbled, a prep of the area and a reload of the entire phrase file should be accomplished.  Each new program release  received  should  be  closely  reviewed  to  ensure  all  loads/changes/deletes  of  affected phrases are made in conjunction with new program loads. 2.5.  Reporting Program Problems. 2.5.1.  Sometimes questions or errors arise that just cannot be resolved at base or MAJCOM level.    These  questions  and  errors  should  be  directed  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology  Activity  Helpdesk  at  Maxwell  AFB,  Gunter  Annex  AL,  DSN:    596-5771,  or commercial:    334-416-5771.    Direct  contact  with  analysts/programmers  is  not  authorized.  Before  calling  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  Helpdesk,  SBSS  users must, at a minimum, first complete the checklist outlined in Para 2.134 for reports and system problems.  The FAB is staffed by individuals who are willing to assist  you.  However,  it is extremely  difficult  to  give  assistance  when  the  basic  problem  has  not  been  defined  and  the background  of  the  events  that  led  to  the  problem  is  not  documented.    The  AFMC  SCM-R AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 69 Information Technology Activity Helpdesk is there to help you, but SBSS users should limit their  calls  to  the  serious  situations  that  CANNOT  be  resolved  at  base  level  or  with  the assistance of the major command (MAJCOM).  Each AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity  supervisor  must  be  contacted  prior  to  any  recoveries  of  the  SBSS  database  that  is performed. 2.5.2.  Once  contact  has  been  established  with  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity Helpdesk, request a control number.  Control numbers are a means of identifying your call for future reference.  More than one call on the same problem will have the same control number.  Therefore, if  you are making an additional  call on the same problem, provide the control  number  previously  issued  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity Helpdesk controller working the call.  In most instances, the controller who is working the call will ask for keyins to be made to give the controller a more descriptive analysis of the problem.  For this reason, depending on the circumstances, have a demand terminal available in the event analytical  inquiries  are  requested.    During  the  course  of  resolving  the  problem  the  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Helpdesk controller may determine that a program discrepancy  exists.    Operational  Field  Test  (OFT)  bases  use  procedures  in  Sec.  2F  for  the submission of DIREPs.  Satellite supply accounts should report all program problems to the host  accounts  for  resolution.    However,  if  the  host  accounts  are  unable  to  help  resolve  the problems,  satellite  supply  accounts  are  authorized  to  call  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity Helpdesk directly to resolve program discrepancies.  The satellite should request assistance from the host account for system problems. 2.6.  Satellite System Problem Reporting.  The DMC support base is responsible for analyzing, collecting, and reporting satellite system problems as follows: 2.6.1.  Anytime the satellite system is online with the DMC. 2.6.2.  Twilight.  When receiving or transmitting data to satellites. 2.6.3.  Reports.  When receiving or transmitting data to satellites. 2.6.4.  The problems experienced are not directly related to any known hardware or operator faults.  To preclude meaningless reporting, the following steps should be taken to verify: 2.6.4.1.  Applicable operation modes of the DMC are established. 2.6.4.2.  Communication  link  between  the  DMC  and  applicable  AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity is established. 2.6.4.3.  The satellite operator is responsible for initiating the problem definition process.  The  supporting  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  is  the  initial  point  of contact for a satellite equipped supply satellite.  The remote station device (RSD) operator can verify system status; that is, online, down, batch, etc. 2.7.  Reporting  Documentation  Errors.  Editorial  errors,  minor  procedural  or  technical inconsistencies,  or  requests  for  clarification  which  do  not  require  immediate  resolution  will  be reported to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity by email, fax or in writing.  DIREPs will not be submitted for these minor changes.  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will coordinate with the OPR for the reference publication to accomplish the required change, if appropriate.  Normal lead time from initiation of a documentation change to its publication is a AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 70 minimum of 90 days.  Documentation errors which require immediate resolution may be called in to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Helpdesk. Section 2B—-AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Operating Guidelines. 2.8.  Overview.  The following documentation is used to provide the information and procedures necessary to manage and operate the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  Although used as a guideline, these procedures should be followed as closely as possible. 2.9.  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity.  Detailed  information  on  the  AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  components  and  operating  instructions  for  individual components can be obtained from this manual.  Input will be processed and the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operated according to the instructions contained in this manual. 2.10.  System Maintenance.  There are two categories of maintenance in this system. 2.10.1.  Automated  Data  Processing  Equipment  (ADPE)  maintenance  covers  all  terminal functions, and all peripheral devices.  Maintenance of the ADPE will be as specified in the current USAF contract and/or by Air Force military personnel specifically trained to perform maintenance.  Operators and other personnel will not attempt to perform maintenance on this ADPE, except for the operator maintenance specifically defined in the operator's manuals. 2.10.2.  Site environment maintenance includes air conditioning, electrical power input to the point  where  the  ADPE  will  be  plugged  in,  etc.    This  type  of  maintenance  will  be  the responsibility of the Base Civil Engineer.  The LRS Commander/Accountable Officer (LRS CC/AO) and AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity,  will advise their Base Civil Engineer  of  the  impact  that  site  environment  has  on  the  ADPE  operation  and  materiel management response. 2.11.  DELETED of  AFMC  SCM-R 2.12.  Control Information  Technology  Activity  Facility Environment.  AFI  33-112,  Information  Technology  Hardware  Asset  Management,  outlines maintenance  care  requirements.    These  guidelines  are  specifically  for  computer  hardware; however, they should be reviewed and normal cleanliness and safety practices applied to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology  Activity /satellite facilities.  The  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity /satellite can operate in an office environment. 2.13.  Access and Restrictions in  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity /Satellite Facility.    There  will  be  no  smoking,  eating,  or  drinking  in  the  immediate  vicinity  or  while operating the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity or SATELLITE hardware.  If the facility is used for office space for Computer Operations personnel, precaution should be exercised to ensure the office facility uses temporary partitions or is far enough away from the hardware to preclude any damage to the hardware or hinder operations.  The facility should have limited access, which includes operations and supervisory personnel, personnel authorized by the LRS CC/AO or personnel  accompanied  by  an  authorized  person.    When  the    AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity /SATELLITE is unattended, sign off will be accomplished and the facility secured. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 71 2.14.  Terminal Response Time.  If poor terminal response time is suspected, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must investigate the following and take corrective action as necessary: 2.14.1.  Retransmits need to cease.  It takes a conscious effort to depress keyboard unlock and transmit.  This builds more transactions queued for processing, creating duplicate transactions, and ultimately causing slower response time.  The only reason to depress the transmit key a second time is if the keyboard is not locked, which means it did not take the first time. 2.14.2.  Query  Language  Program  (QLP),  Supply  Users  Generator  (SURGE),  reports processing,  processing  of  Hand-Held  Terminals  (HHTs)  and  processing  of  NGV278  (CTH INQ)  during  prime  time  (0700-1800)  should  be  held  to  an  absolute  minimum.    These requirements should be processed during non-prime time (1800-0700). 2.14.3.  Review  on  a  daily  basis,  current  SBSS  scheduling  techniques  to  ensure  only  the minimum is being processed on the primary database.  This will enable releveling, follow up, and file status to be accomplished prior to prime on-line time. 2.14.4.  Review  the  catalog  statements  in  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.  and  ensure  that  disk assignments are being utilized.  Ensure that gang one, gang one's transaction history, and gang five have different  disk  assignments.  Also ensure that there are no  Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS) files on these drives. Section 2C—-Standard Supply System (SBSS) Terminal Security System. 2.15.  Overview.  This  section  explains  the  security  measures,  controls,  and  responsibilities  to minimize the risks and vulnerabilities associated with fraud, theft, and sabotage of the SBSS.  The software  controls  described  in  this  section  along  with  other  security  controls  already  in  force provide a means for individual TIP transaction accountability and for controlling who can input and process online.  The examples in this section uses X to represent primary gang number unless otherwise stated. 2.16.  Responsibilities.  Terminal security is an important function for the security of the system.  The primary and alternate Information Assurance Officer is appointed by the LGL and approved by the host and satellite Operations Officer.  These individuals  at host sites will come from the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity.    Each  Information  Assurance  Officer    is responsible  for  the  daily  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  terminal  security  system;  that  is, processing 1SZ inputs in online mode.  The host Information Assurance Officers for the primary gangs (1-4) are responsible for all other actions associated with the terminal security system.  The satellite  Information  Assurance  Officer  is  responsible  for  their  system  designators.    Close coordination with satellite Information Assurance Officers and other host Information Assurance Officers is required during initial implementation, satellite rehoming, and recovery processing of the terminal security utility programs.  Authorization to load/change user identification (User-IDs) must be approved by the LRS Logistics Manager or designated representative. 2.16.1.  Security  Guidelines  for  workstations  and  network  LRS/Materiel  Management Activities. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 72 2.16.1.1.  Workstations  are  considered  to  be  any  personal  computer  (stand  alone, networked,  or  client/server),  or  dumb  terminal  used  by  any  government  employee  or government contractor. 2.16.1.2.  Workstations should  never be left  unattended while open to  an application, or signed on to a network or the SBSS.  Workstations should be signed off whenever the user leaves the work area.  It is the individual’s responsibility to ensure these security measures are applied. 2.16.1.3.  Security  measures  include  the  safeguarding  of  User-IDs,  passwords,  interface protocol  (IP)  addresses,  and  modem  telephone  numbers.    These  should  be  regarded  as sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information and only be provided on a need to know basis.  It is highly recommended that passwords be changed on a regular basis to help reduce the security risk.  Specifically, IP addresses are managed by the local Base Network Control Center  (BNCC)  or  a  designated  local  office  and  provided  on  a  necessary  basis  for connection to the local area network (LAN). 2.16.1.4.  Employees should consider all information entered or accessed on the computer as  SBU.    This  includes  government  computers  (stand  alone;  on  a  LAN;  or  peer-to-peer configurations).  Individual users are responsible for the security of installed applications software and all data input through the workstations.  Because most of these machines have electronic access to numerous database files and access to the SBSS security measures to ensure Class C2 compliance must be implemented to the best extent possible.   This covers workstations  locally  purchased,  brought  in  by  outside  agencies,  or  furnished  by  the government.    It  also  applies  to  software  developed  by  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity, commercial off the shelf (COTS), locally developed, or developed and released by any government agency. 2.16.1.5.  Terminal  area  security  should  be  applied  whenever  the  areas  of  concern  are accessible by unauthorized personnel.  This includes limiting direct access to the terminal, using a COTS screen saver with password protection, and using the operating system (OS) security (access through the OS CMOS BIOS setup when the PC is turned on).  Use of LAN security is also an available method to support in-place security.  Due to the multitude of software packages, operating systems, and COTS products it is suggested you contact your local Information Assurance Officer, LAN administrator or small computer office to implement security procedures and/or activate security software features. 2.16.1.6.  Other  references  include  the  Air  Force  Systems  Security  Instruction  (AFSSI) 5024,  Volume  I,  The  Certification  and  Accreditation  (C  &  A)  Process;  AFSSI  5024, Volume II, The Certifying Official’s Handbook; and AFMAN 33-229, Controlled Access Protection. 2.17.  Logistics  Manager.  The  Logistics  Manager  or  an  appointed  assistant  is  responsible  for review  of  part  8  of  the  Base  Supply  Surveillance  Report  (D20),  which  reflects  unauthorized attempts to process controlled Transaction Identification Codes (TRICs).  Any abuses reflected on the D20 must be resolved through administrative or disciplinary means. 2.18.  Authorizing  Transaction  Processing.  Transactions  will  be  initiated  by  individuals through the Enterprise Solution - Supply (ES-S) application hosted on the AF Portal. Supervisors, the Information Owner and the Information Assurance Officer will determine the need for ES-S AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 73 transaction  processing.    Requests  from  organizations  outside  of  LRS  /  materiel  management activity to process transactions through ES-S must be approved and validated by the Information Owner prior to submission  to  the  Information  Assurance Officer. SBSS  read-only transactions, i.e., INQ, CTH, and ISN are exempt from these controls when processed through ES-S, i.e., all ES-S users are allowed to process read-only transactions to the SBSS without any need for further restrictions/management. All  other transaction processing privileges  will be validated using the ILS-S Automated System  Access Authorization Request  (SAAR).  The DD Form 2875 will be used for access to the SBSS. 2.18.1.  Direct SBSS access.  User-IDs and passwords for direct access to the SBSS are only provided for those functions that are not available in ES-S (to include Demand processing).  Once the need for a user-ID is established, the Information Assurance Officer loads the user-IDs to  the terminal  security file  according to  Para  2.140.  SBSS User-IDs to  support ES-S processing will be established and maintained at the request of AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  User-IDs to support ES-S processing should not be deleted or modified without the approval of AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity. 2.18.2.  Access  through  ES-S.    Access  to  the  SBSS  through  ES-S  (including  transaction processing privileges) will be controlled by the AF Portal’s Tivoli  Access Manager (TAM) and  internal  ES-S  administration.    Users  are  granted  access  to  ES-S  (and  thus  the  SBSS) through the AF Portal’s TAM.  Most users will be assigned the AF Portal’s “IL_Supply_ESS-User” role by an administrator in the requestor’s organization or parent organization(s).  All users authorized access  to ES-S inherit SBSS read-only transactions (INQ, CTH, and  ISN).  However, all other transaction processing privileges will be controlled through the assignment of  Transaction  Groups  and/or  Capabilities  by  authorized  ES-S  administrators.    Transaction Groups contain common transactions associated with specific jobs/workcenters.  Capabilities authorize  access  to  certain  functions  within  the  ES-S  application.  Refer  to  the  ES-S  User’s Manual for more information on ES-S administration. 2.18.2.1.  ES-S  controls  access  to  specific  SBSS  transactions  through  the  use  of Transaction Groups and Capabilities assigned to specific Department of  Defense Activity Address  Codes  (DoDAACs).    ES-S  requires  that  authorized  users  be  associated  with specific  Transaction  Groups/Capabilities  against  specific  DoDAAC(s) to  enable transaction  processing  against  the  DoDAAC(s).    Specific  DoDAACs  will  be  associated with ES-S users by linking an individual AF Portal ID with a DoDAAC or DoDAACs in the ES-S application.  Specific Transaction Groups will then be assigned to each DoDAAC as needed.  DoDAACs and Transaction Groups associated with the user are assigned by any administrator authorized administration rights to the specific DoDAAC(s)/Transaction Group(s). 2.18.2.1.1.  Transaction  Processing.    Transaction  Groups  are  created  and  maintained by the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity based on input from AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and MAJCOM staffs.  Because of the limited number  of  Transaction  Groups  available  in  ES-S,  some  Transaction  Groups  may provide more transaction capability than required for an individual user.  For example, a  user may require access to ISU and DOC but these transactions may be bundled with DIT  in  a  particular  Transaction  Group  (because  the  majority  of  user’s  require  these transactions together).  Any user assigned this group would also receive the ability to AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 74 process DIT (against all DoDAACs the user has the Transaction Group assigned to).  If a specific ES-S Transaction Group is not available to match the individual’s needs then administrators will either assign a lesser Transaction Group (restricting use) or a more  comprehensive  Transaction  Group  and  direct  the  individual  not  to  process  the type of transaction in  question (for example, the  DIT in  the example above).   If the individual  abuses  the  privileges  then  the  authorization  or  transaction  group  will  be removed.  Users are responsible for any transactions and rejects they create using ES-S.  ES-S includes an Audit Trail Component (ATC that records all transactions initiated through ES-S and links the transactions to a specific Portal ID.  The ATC can be used to determine the source of SBSS transactions/rejects initiated through ES-S. 2.18.2.1.2.  Capabilities.  Most Capabilities in ES-S grant access to specific privileges within the ES-S database.  Granting access to any Capability allows users access to that Capability  against  all  assigned  DoDAACs.    However,  the  GET  IT  and  RELEASE ORDER Capabilities allow users to direct shipment (process SHP transactions) from any  SBSS  accounts  (not  just  those  DoDAACs  specifically  assigned  to  the  user).  Because of the powerful nature of these Capabilities, they will only be assigned to users with  a  verified  need  to  perform  these  functions,  e.g.,  MICAP,  Stock  Control,  and AFMC  Item  Management  personnel.    User’s  authorized  access  to  the  GET  IT  and RELEASE  ORDER  functions  retain  the  responsibility  for  clearing  any  rejects associated  with  their  transaction  processing.    The  ATC  of  ES-S  can  be  used  to determine specific ES-S users that generated specific SHP  transactions.   Note:  The RELEASE  ORDER  process  was  designed  to  augment  the  AF’s  unreliable redistribution order (RDO) process that utilizes A2x/A4x transactions to redistribute AFMC  assets.    In  lieu  of  A2x/A4x  transactions,  ES-S  users  with  the  RELEASE ORDER  Capability  will  be  allowed  to  process  SHP  transactions  through  ES-S  to redistribute AFMC assets.  Authorization to utilize the RELEASE ORDER process is controlled by administrators assigned to AFMC. 2.18.2.2.  Crossing MAJCOMs. When a user requests transactional access to a DoDAAC in  another  MAJCOM,  the  AFMC  Information  Technology  Activity  or  The  AFMC Computer Operations Activity will be responsible for validating the needs of the requestor and  granting  access  to  the  new  DoDAAC.  Close  coordination  is  required  between  the AFMC Information Technology Activity and The AFMC Computer Operations Activity in order to provide and maintain the authorized level of access. 2.18.2.3.  Tiered Administration.  The SBSS uses a tiered administration construct.  The administrators  and  lower  level  administrators  under  them  report  directly  to  DISA.    The position  of  AIAO  was  created  to  allow  administrators  within  the  supply  community  to manage access to the SBSS.  AIAOs gain these privileges through agreement with DISA. 2.19.  Controlled  TRICs.  See  AFI  23-101,  Sec  7E,  Integrated  Logistics  Supply  (ILS-S).  The Information Assurance Officer loads the controlled TRICs to the applicable user-ID according to Para 2.140 or Para 2.142 of this handbook.  Controlled TRICs are listed in Para 2.137. All other TRICs are uncontrolled. 2.20.  User Access Validation.  ES-S conducts an automated validation of all Air Force Supply Central Database and ES-S accounts quarterly.   The user’s, the user’s supervisor, the Information Owner and Information Assurance Officer will promptly review each validation request and make AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 75 any adjustments necessary to comply with Air Force policy and to prevent the account from being automatically disabled on the Validation Due Date.  More information on automated validations in  located in  the ES-S Users’ Manual.   The SBSS validation will be conducted quarterly using available technology to  speed the review while ensuring only those users with  a valid need for SBSS access continue to have accounts.  These validations will be conducted by the Information Assurance  Officer  located  at  the  AFMC  Computer  Operations  Activity.    The  Information Assurance Officer provides the Alternate Information Assurance Officer for the host accounts and Operations Officer for all satellite accounts with a list personnel assigned to their organization, their  user-Ids  and  TRIC  authorizations  or  a  copy  of  the  DD  Form  2875,  System  Authorization Access Report (SAAR), for review. After review of the listing (or DD Form 2875), the Information Owner and/or satellites MSOs annotate any changes or deletions then signs the listing or DD Form 2875  and  returns  it  to  the  Information  Assurance  Officer.  The  Information  Assurance  Officer makes  the  required  adds,  changes  or  deletions  and  maintains  the  listing  or  form  until  the  next review. The user-ID listing is an important document allowing SBSS users access to the operating system.  The  Information  Assurance  Officer  must  ensure  that  those  in  "only  a  need  to  know" position have access to this file. A listing with signatures matching DD Form 2875 or a DD Form 2875 must be submitted to the AFMC Computer Operations Activity for new user-IDs between quarterly  reviews.  For  resetting  passwords,  see  the  Controlled  TRICs  paragraph  above.  No additional list or forms will be maintained other than the Information Assurance Officers for the AFMC Information Technology Activity or each flight. 2.21.  Programs and Files.  The files and utilities programs which follow are used in the SBSS Terminal Security System: 2.21.1.  Tip  Common  Bank  (TCB)  Security  File.    The  TCB    security  file  contains  SBSS security  data  for  all  gangs.    This  file  is  updated  during  online  mode  when  a  1SZ  input  is processed, and in the demand mode when the utility program NGVU02 is processed for each ALN.  This file will contain the 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx. files for all gangs.  That is why gang 1 for each ALN must be the point of contact. 2.21.2.  The  Common  Bank  (NGVU02).    The  Common  Bank  is  an  area  in  memory  that contains portions of the TIP security file.  This area is used to validate user-IDs as they sign on the SBSS in the online mode.  The area is also used to validate which controlled TRICs a user  is  authorized  to  process.    This  area  does  not  use  disk  I/Os  and  will  not  slow  down processing.    NGVU02  loads  the  USERFILEx  file  (x  =  gang  number)  into  the  TCB  file TIP$*<ALN>$$000231.  This job is executed by processing: 2.21.2.1.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU02 2.21.2.2.  This job will only print at the demand terminal that started the job.  The output will be a return of the valid system designator (EXAMPLE:  SYS 01, SYS A1, SYS A2 etc.)  and  will  return  with  an  START-OF-ENTRY  (SOE).    Upon  successful  return  from NGVU02, the security file will have been updated according to the information read from the USERFILE. 2.21.3.  Common Bank Load (NGVU03).  Program NGVU03 is used to initialize the security common bank and load the TCB file TIP$*<ALN>$$000231. into the common bank.  This job is executed by processing: 2.21.3.1.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03 AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 76 2.21.3.2.  This job will only print at the demand terminal that started the job.  The output will be a message that says:  LOAD OF ALN/GANG SUCCESSFUL.  Upon successful completion of NGVU03, the security file information for the user's ALN will be loaded into the Fixed Gate Shared Subsystem (FGSS) . 2.21.4.  Display  Utility Program  (NGVU04).   The utility program  NGVU04 reads the TCB security  file  based  on  gang  and  creates  a  temporary  sorted  file  called  $USER$x  (x  =  gang number).  NGVU04 is only processed in the demand mode at the host site by the host security manager.  This file is assigned the qualifier/project-ID of your current demand run.  Also, you will be queried for output queue.  Once NGVU04 has processed, NGVU04 will SYM a copy of your $USER$x file to the input queue.  This listing will display the current security data (user-ID, TRICs, etc.) that is loaded to the common bank.  This job is executed by processing: 2.21.4.1.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU04 2.21.4.2.  Program NGVU04 displays the following prompts: 2.21.4.2.1.  >ENTER GANG NUMBER 2.21.4.2.2.  >  ...(respond with the appropriate one digit) 2.21.4.2.2.1.  GANG NUMBER OF 1, 2, 3, 4. 2.21.4.3.  >ENTER NTR DEVICE (DEFAULT IS PR) 2.21.4.4.  >  ...(  respond with the appropriate print  ) 2.21.4.4.1.  DEVICE IDENTIFIER (I.E., NTR57P). 2.21.4.5.  >ENTER BY USER,NAME,INIT(INITIALS),SYMB(SYMBOL BY) 2.21.4.6.  >  ...(  respond with the appropriate sort  ) 2.21.4.6.1.  SEQUENCE IDENTIFIER OF USER, NAME, INIT, OR SYMB. 2.22.  Special  Instructions.  Upon  a  successful  return  from  NGVU04,  TIP  FILE  #231  will  be retrieved, ordered into the specified sequence, compiled into a listing and SYM'D to the specified print device.  Program NGVU04 will also create a $USER$<GANG> FILE with all the current security  USER-IDs  and  TRICs  loaded  in  the  common  bank.    These  latest  changes  from $USER$<GANG> file 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>.  to  provide  a  backup,  in  case  the  TIP  security  file  is  ever destroyed.        EXAMPLE:  @COPY $USER$<GANG>.,0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>.     Note:  The qualifier of your $USER$x file is dependent upon your current qualifier.  You may check for your current qualifier by executing the @WHOAMI command on your demand page. original master must be copied into the 2.22.1.  0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx.  Files.    The  0GV0*USERFILEx.  files  are  Standard Systems Data File (SSDF) flat files based on gangs 1 through 4.  They are used anytime the SBSS  TIP  security  file  needs  to  be  recovered.    These  files  are  initially  created  by  using Interactive Processing Facility (IPF) or any ASCII editor.  They can be updated with IPF or any American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) editor, or replaced in their entirety with the $USERSX file.  The input of an online 1SZ will not update this file.  Up to 2,000 user-IDs can be maintained in each 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEX. 2.23.  TIP Sign-On Process.  The SBSS terminal security system is initialized each time the SBSS ADS is brought up.  The TIP security file is read into a common bank where it is used to validate AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 77 user-IDs, 1SZ input, and TIP inputs.  When signing on, the Common Bank is checked to validate the user-ID.  If the sign-on is successful, the position identifier (PID) number is attached to the user-ID, the SBSS menu screen appears and online processing begins.  The user can process any of the uncontrolled TRICs, plus any controlled TRICs specified in the security mask. 2.24.  Error  Messages.  The  following  is  a  description  of  errors  displayed  by  the  security applications: 2.24.1.  STATUS  =  0000000014,  0000000016,  or  0000000018.    Either  of  these  errors  may occur  when  processing  NGVU03.    NGVU03  loads  file  TIP$*<ALN>$$000231.  to  the common bank.  If this file (#231) is not cataloged or assigned or the common bank is corrupt, one of these errors will occur.  To clear error(s), correct file condition for file #231 and process NGVU03  with  the  ",S"  option:                           @XQT,S  0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03        Note: This will affect all TIP users on your ALN.  Ensure you coordinate with all applicable SBSS users before processing. 2.24.2.  STATUS  =  0000000015.    This  error  occurs  when  trying  to  sign  on  in  tip.                Process:  <SOE>@XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03         Note:  The S option is omitted when processing job for this error.  Process this program for each gang on your ALN.  Any other nonstandard halt or errors will be accompanied by a console error message. 2.24.3.  NO SYSTEM DES CARD SUBMITTED FOR GANG # (WHERE # IS THE GANG NUMBER) - The input file 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>. did not contain a SYS image for any accounts. 2.24.4.  USER-ID  ALREADY  IN  FILE  -  An  attempt  was  made  to  add  a  USER-ID  which already exists in the security file. 2.24.5.  BAD IMAGE PLEASE CHECK - The input image read was invalid. 2.24.6.  NO MATCH ON TRIC NNN (WHERE NNN IS A TRIC NAME) - Input TRIC is not loaded as a controlled TRIC. 2.24.7.  TIP I/O ERROR ########## (WHERE ########## IS THE I/O ERROR STATUS RECEIVED).    The  read/write  of  the  TCB  security  file  was  unsuccessful.    Processing  is terminated when this error occurs. 2.24.8.  MORE THAN 2000 USER-IDS - An attempt was made to add more than 2000 user-ids. 2.24.9.  TRIC  ALREADY  EXISTS  IN  FILE  -  An  attempt  was  made  to  add  a  TRIC  which already exists in the security file. 2.24.10.  TRIC NUMBER ALREADY EXISTS IN FILE - An attempt was made to add a TRIC with a number which already exists in the security file. 2.24.11.  GANG CARD IS NOT THE FIRST CARD - A ‘GANG’ card (image)was not the first image in the input file. 2.24.12.  GANG  NUMBER  IS  INVALID  -  The  user’s  project-ID  did  not  start  with  a  valid GANG number (1, 2, 3, or 4) or the input GANG number did not match the GANG number from the project-ID. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 78 2.24.13.  NO B CARD FOR TRIC 1SZ - The TRIC 1SZ must be loaded prior to an attempt to add a USER-ID record. 2.24.14.  BAD  SYS  DESG  CARD  -  The  SYS  card  (image)is  invalid  or  contains  an  invalid system designator. 2.24.15.  TOO MANY SYS CARDS SUBMITTED - Too many SYS cards (images)exist in the input file.  A maximum of 10 system designators (01 and A1 THRU A9) may be added to a single gang.  Process @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03 and continue. 2.24.16.  INVALID ALN NUMBER - The USER'S ALN number is invalid.  The USER must not run under an ALN exempt account. 2.24.17.  CALL TO SECURITY BANK WITH  INVALID ALN NUMBER  - The input file 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILE<GANG>.  did  not  contain  the  correct  ALN  qualifier.    This  error occurs when the USER'S ALN or account number is not numeric.  The user must not be ALN exempt,  or  if  on  a  NON-ALN  machine,  it  must  have  a  four-digit  number  as  the  first  four positions which already exist in the security file. 2.24.18.  BAD  GANG  NUMBER  -  Gang  NUMBER  MUST  BE  1,  2,  3,  OR  4,  re-enter appropriate gang number. 2.24.19.  INVALID SORT TYPE INPUT - Sort type must be USER, NAME, INIT OR SYMB, re-enter appropriate sort type. 2.24.20.  THIS ALN <NNNN> AND GANG <X> NOT CONFIGURED WHERE <NNNN> EQUAL USER ALN AND <X> EQUAL USER SPECIFIED GANG NUMBER.  ENSURE YOUR JOB IS STARTED WITH AN @XQT - Self-explanatory; call system coordinator. 2.24.21.  SYS DESIGNATOR DATA CORRUPT - Problem with TIP file #231, call system coordinator. 2.24.22.  TIP FILE 231 FOR ALN <NNNN> IS BAD - PLEASE CHECK RECORD 2.24.23.

FILE ERROR - UNABLE TO ASSIGN <USER FILE> WHERE <USER FILE> IS APPROPRIATELY  QUALIFIED  $USER$<GANG>  FILE  -  Possible  file  conflict  problem; call system coordinator. 2.24.25.  FILE ERROR - UNABLE TO FREE/SYM <USER FILE> WHERE <USERFILE> IS APPROPRIATELY QUALIFIED $USER$<GANG> FILE - Possible file conflict problem, call system coordinator. 2.24.26.  FILE ERROR - UNABLE TO ASSIGN <WORK FILE> WHERE <WORK FILE> IS  A  TEMPORARY  FILE  USED  FOR  SORTING,  IDENTIFIED  AS  NGVU04UD900  - Possible DISC storage problem; call system coordinator. 2.24.27.  FILE ERROR - UNABLE TO FREE,D <USER FILE> WHERE <USER FILE> IS APPROPRIATELY  QUALIFIED  $USER$<GANG>  FILE  -  Possible  file  conflict  problem; call system coordinator.      Note:  A GOOD EOJ (END-OF-JOB) IS CONSIDERED WHEN THERE ARE NO OUTPUT ERROR MESSAGES. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 79 2.24.28.  FILE  ASSIGN  ERROR  OCCURED  WHEN  TRYING  TO  ASSIGN  FILE 0GV0<ALN>*USERFILEx.    This  error  occurs  when  you  process  NGVU02  and  the USERFILEx is  not  cataloged or assigned.  Correct  the condition  with  the USERFILEx and reprocess NGVU02. 2.24.29.  USER-ID NOT FOUND IN SBSS SECURITY FILE.  This message appears if the user-ID is not loaded in the common bank.  The terminal function is marked down when this notice is  produced and the user should contact  the AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity operator to reinitialize the down function.  This message does not apply to function 057.    The  flight  chief  must  inform  the  Information  Assurance  Officer    if  this  user  needs  to access the SBSS database so the TSM can load the user-ID.  This protects the SBSS database from unauthorized sign-on online. 2.24.30.  USER-ID ALREADY ACTIVE ON PID XXX PLEASE CLOSE TERMINAL.  This message appears if the user attempts to sign on more than one terminal online.  The user can $$CLOSE their original terminal and sign on the new terminal.  The user can also acknowledge the message, $$CLOSE, and return to work on the original terminal.  This message can also occur on a partial system crash, if the user was not allowed to close normally. 2.24.31.  USER-ID  LOADED  IN  SYSTEM  DESIGNATOR  TABLE  FOR  SD  PLEASE LOGOFF.  Users may sign on only to the terminals configured to the same system designator as their user-ID.  The message above appears when a user attempts to sign on a terminal which is configured to a system designator different from the user-ID loaded for the user.  When a user has a need to sign on more than one system designator on a gang (each system designator has a separate terminal attached), the user must be assigned separate user-IDs and passwords for each. 2.24.32.  UNABLE TO LOAD SBSS SECURITY FILE.  When the common bank does not contain the required fields of the TIP security file, this message appears.  Steps 3 through 5 in Para  2.147  must  be  processed  before  online  processing  is  allowed.    Once  these  steps  are complete, resume the sign-on process. 2.25.  Terminal Configurations. 2.25.1.  Input/Input Configuration.  This is the normal configuration.  However, some users require two user-IDs/passwords so they can sign on both terminal pages at the same time.  This configuration provides that  capability since a terminal  does not  allow a user more than one terminal page at one time. 2.25.2.  Input/Output or Output/Input.  Terminals with the two-page concept require a special user-ID/password for the output page.  The 1SZI image to load the user-ID must contain OUT in positions 53-55 (TRIC code field) for the output page.  This prevents any online inputs from processing on the output page.  Therefore, this page can remain signed on for output under this user-ID as long as the work area is manned. 2.26.  Processing TIP Inputs. 2.26.1.  Transaction  Accountability.    Once  an  authorized  user  signs  on  in  the  online  mode, normal processing starts, and the user can process any uncontrolled TRICs and their authorized controlled  TRICs.    After  successful  processing  of  online  transactions,  the  user's  initials  are stored in the applicable transaction histories. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 80 2.26.2.  301 Rejects.   A 301 reject  notice occurs  when a user tries to  input an unauthorized controlled TRIC.  When this happens, the user's initials and the time the input was attempted are automatically placed in the last eight positions of the input images.  However, the user's initials are not reflected on the 301 reject notice for uncontrolled TRICs.  The 301 reject notice for controlled TRICs are printed in part 8 of the Base Surveillance Report (D20).  Currently, 301 reject  notices are  the only  rejects  that contain the user's initials.   Some 301 rejects  can appear on the D20 due to security processing (NGVU02/NGVU03).  These 301 rejects do not contain user’s initials because security common bank is being initialized during the security process.   Enterprise Solution  – Supply (ES-S) sessions also  will  produce 301 rejects  due to their persistent connection.  These ES-S 301 rejects can be identified by looking up the function number within the Base Constants Processor (NGV068A) to determine if they came from ES-S.   If they  came from  ES-S, these 301  rejects  can be disregarded because TRIC security is controlled within the ES-S application and not in SBSS. 2.26.3.  Terminal Security.  There are two factors which cause an uncontrolled TRIC to reject with  a 301 reject  notice  and print part 8 of the D20 Report without initials.  The first  is  an unauthorized sign on in TIP.  Security software rejects any input from an unauthorized user with a 301 reject, and the initials are blank because the user is not in the SBSS security file.  The second is the terminal security mask is in the common bank and is corrupt.  The mask for terminal security in the common bank corrupts when an uncontrolled TRIC appears with a 301 reject.  To check for this condition, process: 2.26.3.1.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU04 2.26.3.2.  If  a  good  end-of-job  is  received,  the  security  mask  is  not  corrupt.    If  you  are unable to get a good end-of-job, the Information Assurance Officer must coordinate with the DMC operator to do the following: 2.26.3.2.1.  @MSG PLZ DOWN SBSS ADS xGV 2.26.3.2.2.  Review your USERFILEx to ensure user-IDs are correct. 2.26.3.2.3.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU02 2.26.3.2.4.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGVU03 2.26.3.2.5.  @MSG PLZ UP SBSS ADS xGV 2.26.4.  Processing  1SZ  Inputs.    The  SBSS  terminal  security  system  should  be  updated  in online  mode  with  1SZ  inputs.    These  inputs  are  used  to  load,  change,  or  delete  controlled TRICs, user-IDs, and other data to the TIP Security File and Common Bank.  The 1SZ will not process through pseudo.  If the 1SZ processes successfully, INPUT PROCESSED is returned.  If unsuccessful, one of the following notices is produced: 2.26.4.1.  INVALID USERID NOT FOUND IS SBSS SECURITY FILE.  This means you are trying to process against a user-ID not loaded in the security file.  Correct the user-ID in the input image or load the user-ID to the system. 2.26.4.2.  INVALID TRIC NOT FOUND IN SBSS SECURITY FILE.  This means you are trying to process against an uncontrolled TRIC.  Correct the TRIC in the input image, or load the TRIC to the system. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 81 2.26.4.3.  INVALID USERID ALREADY IN SBSS SECURITY FILE.

Processing NGV221 Through SBSS Security.  Program  NGV221  has been modified to include SBSS security checks against images being loaded to the pseudo.  Procedures are contained in Sec. 2J. Section 2D—-LRS / Materiel Management Activity ADP Personnel Requirements 2.29.  Overview.  This  section  outlines  the  procedures  for  selecting,  training,  and  maintaining proficiency of  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity -II and DMC satellite operators. 2.30.  Training. 2.30.1.  The  continuing  availability  of  trained,  qualified    AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity  and DMC satellite operators depends upon the care and attention given to  the  training  of  those  selected  and  the  maintenance  of  proficiency.    The  criteria  used  are discussed in the paragraphs that follow: 2.30.2.  Except as explained in paragraphs below, it is mandatory that airmen basics, civilian employees  and  retrainees  selected  as  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity operators  successfully  complete  the  formal  Supply  Systems  Specialist  Course  prior  to operating the standard  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity -II and satellite DMC terminal  functions.    A  formal  request  for  a  quota  to  the  training  course  will  be  submitted immediately upon selection of the individual for operator duty.  On the Job Training (OJT) will  begin  upon  assignment  to  Computer  Operations.    The  training  will  consist  of  all  tasks outlined  in  JTS  2S032,  except  those  involving    AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity  operator duties. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 82 2.30.3.  The following training conditions apply unless restricted by the MAJCOM: 2.30.3.1.  Personnel  selected  as    AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  operators and scheduled to attend the Supply Systems Specialist Course may operate the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity    and/or  satellite  DMC  input/output functions  under  carefully  supervised  conditions  before  completion  of  the  mandatory course. 2.30.3.2.  SBSS input/output functions are currently utilized for two general applications:  (1) as communications equipment for satellites of the Standard Base Supply System, and (2) as terminal functions in Receiving, Demand Processing, etc., at larger bases instead of terminals.  Therefore, the amount of training required for each application is different. 2.30.3.2.1.  For  SBSS  input/output  functions  used  to  support  satellites  of  the  SBSS, operators may be trained by OJT and may possess a 2S071 AFSC.  Parent commands should  ensure  that  at  least  two  personnel  are  assigned  that  have  been  provided familiarization  training  on  this  ADPE.    OJT  training  provided  to  2S071  AFSC personnel will suffice for familiarization training. 2.30.3.2.2.  For SBSS input/output functions used as terminal functions within the LRS CC/AO organization, operators may be trained by OJT and may have a 2S071 AFSC.  Bases  must  ensure  that  at  least  two  2S072  personnel  are  assigned  in  Computer Operations with specified training. 2.30.3.2.3.  To  ensure  continuation  of  proficiency,  participation  is  a  minimum  of  1 work week to  include a  complete normal  end-of-month.  Hands on  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity  operation is required semiannually for personnel in the grade of E-6 (TSgt) and below, not performing the duty. Section 2E—-Automated Data System (ADS) Production Control Procedures 2.31.  Overview.  This  section  outlines  general  and  minimum  production  control  procedures required to satisfy the data processing needs of AF stock record accounts supported by the USAF Standard Base Supply System.  These procedures include the ADPE utilization requirements of all functions  involved  in  LRS  /  materiel  management  activity  operations:    that  is,  satellite  and Accounting  &  Finance  (A&F).    The  provisions  of  this  section  are  designed  to  implement  the in  AFI  33-116,  Long-haul MAJCOM  and  ADPE  custodian  responsibilities  outlined Telecommunications Management.  The Host Standard Base Supply System (DMC) scheduling directly affects the shift manning and efficient use of ADPE resources for all supported activities.  Under no circumstances will the SBSS/DMC processing be disrupted, or delayed to compensate for satellite nonavailability. 2.32.  Concepts.  Usage  of  the  SBSS  ADS  will  be  preplanned  and  systematically  scheduled  to obtain  maximum  online  time  each  workday.    However,  database  integrity  programs,  (Data Management  Utility  (DMU)-VERIFY,  NDA500,  IRU-DUMPS)  will  not  be  sacrificed  for  any reason. 2.32.1.  Processing  Sequence.    All  USAF  Standard  Base  Supply  System  programs/products will  normally  be  processed  prior  to  running  MAJCOM,  local,  or  as  required  programs.  Exceptions  to  this  policy  will  be  held  to  the  strictest  minimum  and  will  not  be  allowed  to AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 83 interfere  with  the  mandatory,  sequence  controlled  reports.    Locally  devised  programs  that duplicate data provided through standard programs or products may not be processed. 2.32.2.  Duties.  The LGLO (Computer Operations) will be responsible for the compilation, ADS processing, publication, and distribution of SBSS ADS schedule data. 2.32.3.  Workload, shift manning, and all customer operations are directly regulated by SBSS ADS production schedules.  Therefore, copies of the schedules must be furnished in advance to  SBSS  flight  offices,  satellite  Materiel  management  officer,  A&F,  Fuels  and  all  satellite accounts.  The forecast and daily processing schedules should only be distributed as outlined above.  Local conditions may require further distribution; that is, to section level, reducing the number of copies by joint use where possible. 2.32.4.  Although the LGLO is responsible for final production of SBSS ADS schedules, each function is responsible for ensuring their data processing requirements are included in the daily processing schedules. 2.32.5.  At least once each month, the LRS CC/AO should review the effectiveness of their local ADS production control.  It is recommended that this review be made during a periodic How-Goes-It meeting.  At this time, supported functions should brief the LRS CC/AO on the effectiveness of ADS schedules for their function, and apprise them of any major workloads anticipated for the coming month. 2.32.6.  The  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  supervisor  will  assign  ADS scheduling duties to an individual within Computer Operations.  This individual will be known as the ADS scheduler, and will be the contact on all subjects related to ADS scheduling. 2.32.7.  Under no circumstances will a single individual, or function, attempt to accomplish ADS scheduling for all LRS / materiel management activity operations.  This practice is known as scratch pad scheduling, and results in uncoordinated LRS / materiel management activity operations;  that  is,  mismanagement  of  available  manpower  and  ADPE  caused  by communication breakdowns between Computer Operations and supported activities. 2.33.  ADS Production Control.  The high real-time processing speeds, high costs, specialized training,  and  concentration  of  human  effort  involved  in  this  automated  data  processing  system require the most demanding attention from all supervisors.  The use of the USAF Standard Base Supply System will be regulated through production control methods.  These methods are to be implemented to ensure end products are obtained in a timely and orderly manner, and that ADS utilization time is precisely fitted to meet the operational needs for maximum supply support. 2.34.  Forecasting.  There  are  three  basic  types  of  forecasting  within  the  AFMC  SCM-R Information  Technology  Activity  operations  section.    They  are  Monthly  Forecast,  Daily Operations  schedule,  and  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  Operations schedule. 2.34.1.  Monthly Forecast.  Once each month the ADS scheduler will prepare a forecast of all known SBSS jobs to be run the following month.  This forecast will be prepared and distributed as specified by the 10th workday of the month.  Each function will review the forecast with their sections to ensure that all regular and special processing jobs are listed and scheduled on the dates required.  All change requests must be forwarded to the ADS scheduler by the 15th workday  of  the  month.    If  the  schedule  is  transmitted  via  satellites,  satellite  accounts  may AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 84 prepare change request to the schedule in the form of images and transmit them to the DMC SBSS ADS scheduler via satellites.  This will reduce delays caused by mailing.  In addition to forwarding the change request to the ADS scheduler, the monthly forecast schedule received must be annotated and retained as the anticipated daily operations schedule. 2.34.2.  Daily Operations Schedule.  Upon return of the change request to the monthly forecast schedule,  the  ADS  scheduler  will  make  all  necessary  adjustments  to  the  schedule.    If  the number  of  changes  to  the  forecast  warrant  it,  prepare  the  daily  operations  schedule  and distribute  it  to  the  users.    All  change  requests  received  by  the  ADS  scheduler  must  be acknowledged by letter or telephone. 2.34.3.  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Operations Schedule.  Along with daily  operational  plans,  the  ADS  operator  scheduler  will  also  produce    AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity  operator schedules.  Computer Operations shift leaders will review these schedules to ensure they contain sufficient instructions for Computer Operations and that all jobs are accomplished as scheduled.  The ADS scheduler and the functional users will coordinate on such matters as implementation dates, data revisions, end-of-quarter/year jobs, and any other changes affecting both functions. Section 2F—-Operational System Testing 2.35.  Overview.  This  section  provides  procedures  for  bases  supporting  operational  testing  of Integrated  Logistics  Systems-Supply  (ILS-S)  software  releases.    This  includes  “legacy” maintenance releases for the SBSS, as well as releases for the Enterprise Solution – Supply (ES-S).    Operational  testing  usually  involves  a  limited  number  of  supply  accounts  (bases)  working closely together with  the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology  Activity, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, A4R staff at the MAJCOMs (MAJCOM), Defense Information Systems  Agency  (DISA)  Oklahoma  City,  DISA  Montgomery,  and  occasionally,  functional representatives from the Air Staff.  Operational testing is the final phase of a sometimes lengthy software development test and evaluation process all ILS-S releases undergo.  The objective of operational testing is to ensure release installation and configuration instructions are accurate and provide  an  opportunity  to  observe  system  behavior  under  actual  operating  conditions.    During operational testing, the Air Force uses a variety of bases with various missions and workloads to identify and repair as many software deficiencies (also referred to as defects) as possible prior to releasing  ILS-S  software  Air  Force-wide.    The  importance  of  operational  testing  cannot  be emphasized enough – key to the success of operational testing is a cooperative relationship with all operational test participants. 2.36.  Designation of Test Bases.  The retail supply system is complex yet robust  – it supports many very different missions in many countries.  The ILS-S information systems the Air Force uses to support these missions are just as complex – and robust.  Therefore, no single base or retail supply site can adequately provide all of the conditions required to fully test (both functional and technical) every ILS-S supply software release.  For this reason, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity ILS-S Program Manager and ILS-S Test Director, with the assistance of the MAJCOMs  and  AFMC  SCM-R  Activity  identifies  bases  with  the  appropriate  missions  and workload  needed  to  adequately  test  the  various  features  and  capabilities  provided  in  upcoming ILS-S software releases.  Concurrence of the appropriate MAJCOM and AFMC SCM-R Activity is  necessary  before  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  Test  Director  will AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 85 designate  a  base  as  an  operational  test  site.    Normally,  only  designated  operational  test  bases receive test releases; however, other bases may be included in operational testing as the need arises.  Including  bases  other  than  those  that  normally  participate  in  operational  testing  must  be coordinated and agreed upon by all test participants. 2.37.  Designation  of  Test  Monitors.  The  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality  Assurance  Activity  Test Director  will  contact  MAJCOM  and  AFMC  SCM-R  Activity  staff  requesting  operational  test support for upcoming ILS-S releases that require operational testing.  MAJCOM and AFMC SCM-R  Activity  staff  will  assign  a  lead  test  monitor  for  each  ILS-S  release.    Many  ILS-S  releases (especially  those  for  the  SBSS)  include  system  changes  that  in  some  way  influence  base-level supply-centric  functions.    However,  many  ILS-S  releases  (to  include  the  SBSS)  also  influence other base-level organizations whose mission or workload relies heavily on a stable and smoothly functioning supply system.  Therefore, operational test monitors should work closely with base-level  organizations  to  ensure  the  operational  testing  of  ILS-S  releases  minimizes  mission degradation or operational performance.  Organizations such as the Defense Finance & Accounting Service (DFAS) Field  Site, Aircraft Maintenance, Vehicle Management,  Civil  Engineering  and other organizations where appropriate should be made aware of the upcoming operational test and the anticipated system changes.  In fact, all ILS-S users at the operational test site should be made aware  of  the  upcoming  system  changes  and  how  it  may  affect  their  workload.    All  operational testing discussions and coordination to include email traffic, conference calls and other meetings will  include  at  a  minimum:    representation  from  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality  Assurance  Activity, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, the MAJCOM, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and the operational test sites.  All AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity communication in regards to an upcoming operational test will flow through the AFMC SCM-R Information  Technology  Activity  and  MAJCOM  test  monitors  to  ensure  AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity and MAJCOM staff are aware of all system testing issues and potential problems.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and/or the host LRS with  satellite  accounts  will  designate  individuals  at  each  satellite  account  to  monitor  system behavior during operational testing – these individuals should report any system performance or behavioral problems to the host LRS LGLO and to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  The satellite account monitors will also support operational release testing for those test scenarios that require support from satellite operations.  Normal duties as outlined in AFI 23-101, Sec  1C,  Satellite  Operations  and  as  designated  by  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Commander/LRS CC/AO/Supply Management Business Activity Chief (DFAS Field Site) apply to the designated host base monitor.  Additional duties for the operational test monitors are as follows: 2.37.1.  Coordinate system changes with interfacing systems such as IMDS, CMOS and DFAS Field Site. 2.37.2.  Ensure  all  AFMC  SCM-R  materiel  management  activities  and  DFAS  Field  Site personnel are operating the same as an operational test base. 2.37.3.  Review advance release documentation and ensure all affected sections and supported organizations are aware of upcoming system  changes.  Ensure system users at  the test sites notify  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  and  LRS  LGLO  personnel  of  any system deficiencies that arise during the test. 2.37.4.  Ensure system users are aware of new operating procedures and trained if necessary. 2.37.5.  Recommend operational or procedural changes as required. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 86 2.38.  Loading Test Programs.  DISA Oklahoma City system (legacy SBSS releases) or GCSS-AF system administrators (ES-S releases) will coordinate test release loads with  staff members from  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality  Assurance  Activity,  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity  and  MAJCOMs.    Test  releases  are  normally  shipped  by  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality Assurance  Activity  by  Wednesday  for  installation  on  the  following  weekend  to  reduce  system unavailability  (outages).    Week-day  (normal  duty  hours)  release  loads  are  kept  to  a  minimum.  Depending  on  the  application,  some  releases  will  have  a  specific  effective  date  assigned  –  the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Test Director will ensure all test participants are aware of  situations  such  as  these.    LRS  test  monitors/liaisons  should  notify  the  AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity or MAJCOM staff if mission requirements or workload prevent loading the release as scheduled by AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity. 2.39.  Distribution of Release Documentation.  The AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Test Director in  conjunction with the test manager from the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity will distribute advance test release documentation – various means are available to include email and logistics communities of practice web sites.  Arrangements for test release distribution will be made by the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Test Director in conjunction with LRS,  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  and  MAJCOM  test  participants.    Test monitors must ensure advance release documentation is distributed to every ILS-S system user to ensure  system  users  are  aware  of  the  upcoming  system  changes  and  also  understand  how  the changes will affect their role and duties. 2.40.  Special Requirements.  At times, AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity may request system information relevant to a particular operational test – these requests include output from reports, inquiries and requests for special programs/processing.  These requests will be kept to a minimum and will be submitted by telephone or email to the test monitors. 2.41.  Evaluation of Testing  .  During operational testing, test bases should attempt to operate under  normal  conditions.    However,  at  times  it  may  be  necessary  to  put  a  special  emphasis  on testing certain aspects of a release – those tests will be coordinated with AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity, the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and MAJCOMs.  AFMC SCM-R staff and other key functions on base should be fully aware of the upcoming operational test and system changes.  The LRS CC/AO should periodically inform other base organizations (Aircraft and Vehicle Management, Civil Engineers, etc.) that their workload and mission may be affected by a supply release undergoing operational testing.  Feedback from these organizations concerning their observations of the test release is highly encouraged.  The personnel who work with  the  ILS-S  systems  input/output  products  and  use  supply  procedures  on  a  daily  basis  are usually the first to identify a software defect.  Test monitors and system users should be on the lookout for the type of errors listed below: 2.41.1.  Invalid rejects for a particular type of input processing. 2.41.2.  Database key/set errors. 2.41.3.  Unexplained increase or decrease in output products. 2.41.4.  Invalid records. 2.41.5.  Abnormal increase/decrease in processing time. 2.41.6.  Inconsistencies between documentation and input/output formats. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 87 2.41.7.  Erroneous data in output products. 2.41.8.  Terminals not being released. 2.41.9.  Terminals output being misdirected. 2.41.10.  Loss of audit trail. 2.41.11.  TIP hang-ups. 2.42.  Reporting Program/Procedural Problems.  Test bases will report all defects to the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity.  To contact the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity Helpdesk, Team 4 call DSN 596-5771, options 1, 4, 2 or e-mail team4@gunter.af.mil.  AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  level  two  help  desk  personnel  will  help  research potential problems and if necessary, create a DIREP (incident).  Procedural problems should be reported  by  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  test  monitors  but  feedback  is highly encouraged from other work centers to include the LRS and other base-level organizations.  All test base personnel should be encouraged to make comments and recommendations concerning these testing techniques.  Also, operational testing conference calls are held for most operational tests  and  include  all  test  participants  –  these  calls  are  an  excellent  forum  for  identifying  and discussing potential system problems. Section 2G—-Modes, Preparation, and Initialization 2.43.  Overview.  This  section  describes  the  different  modes  of  ADPE  processing,  method  of scheduling, and operating instructions for the AFMC SCM-R  Information Technology Activity and satellites.  Anytime the system is received from the DMC from either a disk prep, JK-413, or any  system  maintenance  it  is  MANDATORY  for  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity personnel to process NDA500 (all sets), DMU VERIFY, VERIFY CALC and to take an Integrated  Recovery  Utility  (IRU)  safety  dump.    Failing  to  do  so  may  result  in  bringing  users online with an unstable database. 2.44.  Modes  of  Processing.  The  four  basic  modes  of  processing  within  the  SBSS  ADS  are:  Online, Twilight, Reports, and Utility. 2.44.1.  Online.  This mode covers all SBSS processing from the time the beginning-of-day (BOD) initialization image is processed until the END image is processed.  The purpose of online  processing  is  to  post  individual  supply  transactions,  accomplish  updating  of  internal supply  and  monetary  records,  create  output  documents,  and  store  data  required  for  later preparation of audit documents.  Online processing presupposes the capability to handle input on a random basis without regard to type of document.  Examples of transactions processed online are as follows:  issues, receipts, turn-ins, shipments, and file maintenance.  This mode also controls the collection of input requests, the distribution of output to terminal functions, and  the  initiation  of  read,  output  images,  and  print  operations.    The  online  environment  is normally established with SETUP/HVTIP or existing runstreams with one copy of NGV208A for execution (single-thread). 2.44.2.  Twilight.  This mode includes all SBSS processing from the time the END image is processed  until  the  first  report  select  RPT  image  is  processed.    Its  purpose  is  to  allow processing of batch input, or special runs that create transaction histories or update the SBSS AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 88 database prior to the first report select image being processed.  There is a capability to return to online processing from this mode. 2.44.3.  Reports.  This mode covers all processing from the time the first report select image is processed  until  the  RPTEON  (report  end-of-night)  image  is  processed.    Its  purpose  is  to provide mandatory and optional reports, and management products.  Once this mode is entered, the SBSS cannot return to online or twilight processing for that transaction date. 2.44.4.  Utility.    This  mode  covers  the  period  of  time  after  reports  processing  and  prior  to initialization BOD for the next SBSS ADS processing day.  The utility programs are activated by inserting the appropriate NGV select image into the SBSS runstream. 2.45.  Preparation.  When the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator is ready to start processing, all SBSS ADPE to be used must be placed in a ready condition and the AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  must  establish  its  session  with  the  host  DMC.    For twilight, reports, and utility processing, the operating instructions for each program described in this  manual,  specify  the  functions  that  will  be  used.    Prepare  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity equipment as follows: 2.45.1.  Ensure  all  power  switches  are  ON  including  the  modems  for  all  terminals,  if applicable. 2.45.2.  Sign-on Procedures  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  To establish the sessions with the DMC, the following procedures must be followed: 2.45.2.1.  Sign PAGE 1 of the terminal on to the host in transaction mode as follows: 2.45.2.1.1.  Depress XMIT key.  The $$SON (terminal-ID), $$OPEN T (system-ID), and  LOGON  are  internally  generated  for  bases  processing  under  simple  sign-on procedures.  The response will be:  ENTER USER-ID/PASSWORD. 2.45.2.1.2.  Enter  user-ID/password,  depress  XMIT  key.    The  response  will  be:  The SBSS System Status Screen or the Menu Screen.  *OPEN is internally generated for bases  operating  under  Simple  Sign-on.    The  terminal  is  now  ready  to  accept  online transactions.  If the response is ADS IS DOWN, contact host DMC for status of system. 2.45.2.2.  Sign on to PAGE 2 as follows: 2.45.2.2.1.  Depress PAGE key to gain access to PAGE 2. 2.45.2.2.2.  Enter  $$SON  (terminal-ID),  depress  XMIT  key.    The  response  will  be:  ENTER SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST. 2.45.2.2.3.  Enter $$OPEN D (system-ID), depress XMIT key.  The response will be:  SESSION PATH OPEN TO D (system-ID) ENTER USER-ID/PASSWORD 2.45.2.2.4.  Enter user-ID/password, depress XMIT key.  The system will respond with successful sign-on messages.  The page number will be indicated by the number 1 or 2 in the lower left hand corner of the terminal (screen). 2.45.2.2.5.  SBSS  System  Menu  Options  (  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity): 2.45.2.2.5.1.  $$CLOSE.  Closes the terminal from the active TIP session. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 89 2.45.2.2.5.2.  STATUS.  Shows system and terminal status. 2.45.2.2.5.3.  SSW***.  This selection is reserved for the console operator to set the three SBSS sense switches.  To set the sense switches, modify the three asterisks using the following criteria.  The first asterisk is for sense switch 1.  The second asterisk is for sense switch 2.  The third asterisk is for sense switch 3.  A 1 turns on applicable  sense  switch  while  0  turns  it  off.    To  turn  sense  switches  on  for  the secondary gang, place an S in position 8 of the input.  An example showing how to turn on sense switch 2 for gang 5 follows:  SSW010 and hit XMIT on page 1 or SSW*1* S and hit XMIT on page 1. 2.45.2.2.5.4.  #051.  To aid in data entry, a DPS Overview purpose input screen is available.  To select this screen, tab to this selection and depress the XMIT key.  To return to the SBSS System menu enter MENU and depress XMIT. 2.45.2.2.6.  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  Session  Termination.  Enter $$CLOSE and then $$SOFF to terminate session. 2.46.  Initialization.  The SBSS ADS must be initialized prior to processing with either the online or offline (twilight, reports, utility modes) SBSS routines.  To initialize the system, accomplish the following steps: 2.46.1.  Insert an INT image into the SBSS runstream.  See Para 2.155. 2.46.2.  When  initialization  is  completed,  a  725  REJECT  will  be  displayed  on  the  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console. 2.46.3.  To change the requisition data at the same time the transaction data is changed, place the DAY image immediately behind the INT image and it will be processed. 2.46.4.  Special Instructions.  System initialization images (TRIC INT) must be input as batch inputs.  The END will only be input through the main AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity TIP terminal. 2.46.5.  Any batch input can be input through the demand mode (PAGE 2); however, only one execution of NGV801A per database (gang) number can take place at one time.  The PROJ-ID on the run image will be used to identify the SBSS that originated the input; for example, 1GV0 = gang 1, 2GV0 = gang 2, 3GV0 = gang 3 and 4GV0 = gang 4. 2.47.  Types of Initialization.  Four types of initialization can be accomplished.  The type selected by the program will depend upon the settings of the control flags on the special control record and the code in the INT image.  They are Beginning-of-Day (BOD), Restart Online, Restart Offline, Restart Beginning-of-Day. 2.47.1.  Beginning-of-Day (BOD).  This will occur on the first initialization after the RPTEON image is processed.  Flags A, C, and I were ON in the special control record.  These flags will be set in the OFF position, the date will be advanced, and the transaction serial number will be reset. 2.47.2.  Restart Online.  This will occur when online processing was in effect at the time the last restart record was written to the DBRA (database record area).  Flags A, C, and I were OFF in the special control record. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 90 2.47.3.  Restart Offline.  This will occur when offline processing was in effect at the time the last restart record was written to the DBRA.  Flag A was ON and Flag I was OFF.  Flag C may be either ON or OFF. 2.47.4.  Restart  Beginning-of-Day.    This  will  occur  when  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity operator requests a return to online processing.  Flag A was ON and will be  set  to  OFF.    Flags  C  and  I  were  OFF.    Date  and  transaction  serial  numbers  will  not  be changed. 2.48.  NGV214 Failure.  If NGV214 fails due to hardware or a system crash, the previously active document image file will be recovered automatically when the system is restarted.  When NGV214 does not appear to reactivate following a system restart, the following will occur.  Wait for another NTR device output to be queued by NGV211A, whereby NGV214 is activated and automatic file recovery results. 2.49.  NGV280.  The  following  documentation  is  to  be  used  to  print  NGV214  or  NGV908 documents in the print queue for the laser or bar code printer.                                         @COPY,A 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV280,TPF$.                           @XQT    NGV280 2.49.1.  Message Output Routine Environment (MORE).  This processor allows programs to deliver  printable  messages  in  an  efficient  manner.    MORE  was  developed  for  one  specific problem;  the  uncontrolled  buildup  of  outputs  (QITEMS)  waiting  to  be  delivered  to  PIDs.  NGV211A  interfaces  with  MORE.    NGV211A  will  determine  if  the  documents  should  be passed to MORE or NGV214. 2.50.  Classified Processing.  No classified processing will be executed via the  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  To conform with the requirements of AFI 31-401, Information Security Program Management, and AFI 14-303, Release of Intelligence to U.S. Contractors, the Data Communications Processor (DCP) switch will be physically turned OFF at the DMC main site, thus disconnecting all functional terminals from the DMC when classified reports are being processed. Section 2H—-Operators and SBSS Communications Interface 2.51.  Overview.  This  section  describes  the  various  inputs  available  to  the  remote  processing station ( AFMC SCM-R Information  Technology Activity) operator to control communications with other supply terminals and change data on the BASE-CONSTANTS-2 (014) records. 2.52.  Communications  Inputs.  There  are  four  inputs  to  control/inquiry  the  communications functions for SBSS terminals.  A brief description of each follows: 2.52.1.  Online and Twilight Mode Terminal Control Input (COM REM).  This input is used to control the operation of terminal functions.  See Para 2.149 for input format. 2.52.2.  Status.    Displays  various  information  on  status  of  the  database  and  contents  of  the BASE-CONSTANTS-2 (014) record.  See Para 2.150 for input and output format. 2.52.3.  Terminal  Message  Input.   Allows AFMC SCM-R Information  Technology Activity operator  to  send  messages  to  any  SBSS  terminal.    See  Para  2.149  and  Para  2.152  for input/output format. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 91 2.52.4.  End.  Changes the SBSS database from online to twilight (END-OF-DAY) mode.  The END image processes an interactive communication interface (ICI) ready down (ICIRDYDN) if any system designator has an active automated data system interface. 2.53.  Interactive Communication Interface (ICI).  This processor provides the SBSS with the capability to pass images to or receive images from another automated data system (ADS).  These inputs apply to any ADS interface that has the 001-ADS-ACTIVE-IND turned on.  The following are  the  two  main  ICI  keyins  used  by  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  to control the ICI processor: 2.53.1.  ICIRDYUP (ICI Ready Up).  This input allows other ADSs to communicate directly with the SBSS.  The ICIRDYUP input also checks the mailbox and passes any images in the mailbox to the SBSS for processing.  Use this to start receiving inputs from any interfacing ADS. 2.53.2.  ICIRDYDN  (ICI  Ready  Down).    This  input  disconnects  any  ADS  from  directly interfacing with SBSS.  When processed, any images passed by other ADSs will go into the mailbox.  Use this to stop receiving inputs from any interfacing ADS. 2.53.2.1.  EXAMPLE:   If  the  001-ADS-ACTIVE-IND  for  the  Core  Automated Maintenance  System  (CAMS)  is  turned  on  (001-CAMS-M  =  M)  and  you  wish  to  stop receiving  inputs  from  IMDS  (that  is,  manual  processing,  supply  transaction  recovery (STR), etc.), then process an ICIRDYDN.  Any inputs made by IMDS to the SBSS database will go to the mailbox instead of to the SBSS for processing.  To resume accepting inputs from IMDS, process an ICIRDYUP (manual processing complete). 2.54.  Limited  ADP  System  Control  Keyins.  These  keyins  are  used  to  inquire  the  status  of, change  the  processing  sequence  of,  to  delete  or  change  sequence,  or  routing  of  print  files designated for the SBSS ADS.  See Para.  2.154 for keyin format and description. Section 2I—-Requisition Date, Releveling, Follow-up, File Status Control 2.55.  Overview.  Releveling,  follow-up,  and  file  status  are  performed  under  the  control  of  the online SBSS system support programs.  Operator control over the assignment of requisition dates, starting/stopping of releveling, follow-up, and file status is maintained by the processing of a DAY image.  See Para 2.155 for the DAY image format. 2.56.  Requisition Date Control.  The Julian date assigned to requisitions created by the SBSS is updated by advancing the internally stored date.  This is accomplished by specifying the number of days the existing requisition date is to be advanced in position 4 of the DAY image.  The Julian date  assigned  to  requisitions  can  be  advanced  from  1  to  9  days  any  time  during  the  online  or twilight mode. 2.57.  Requisition Serial Number Control.  Requisition serial numbers are addressed in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 1, Ch 5.  Whenever the requisition date is advanced, the requisition serial number will be reset to 0001.  The serial number is displayed on a TIP page by the STATUS command.  The 002-REQUISITION-SERIAL-NBR field contains this data.  Whenever you have a mismatch in this field it can be corrected by processing the INT image through a canned runstream.  This field can also be modified by processing the canned runstream GV$$0000*TCBRUN$.NGVU72.  If, however, NGVU72 is processed, it will set the 002 record field 002-REQUISITION-SERIAL-AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 92 NBR  to  equal  0001.    NGVU72  is  also  processed  in  the  GV$$0000*TCBRUN$.CREATE/GV-TCB element. 2.58.  Suppression of Releveling, Follow-up, File Status.  See Para.  2.155 for these procedures. 2.59.  Restarting of Releveling, Follow-up, File Status.  See Para.  2.155 for these procedures. 2.60.  Day Image Control.  All retail supply system-generated and manually initiated requisitions must contain the current Julian date.  Computer Operations section will normally change the retail supply  system  date  when  the  beginning-of-day  (BOD)  input  is  processed.    When  Computer Operations specifies a date change, the requisition serial number is reset to 0001.  The mandatory times  for  date  changes  are  necessary  to  ensure  depot  requisitions  and  MICAP  START/STOP reporting  contain  accurate  dates.    Scheduling  of  releveling,  follow-up,  and  file  status  is  the responsibility of LGLO and must be monitored by the LRS CC/AO and major and subordinate commands.    Every  effort  will  be  made  to  process  releveling  daily.    Other  operations  will  be accomplished as frequently as operational circumstances dictate.  The LGRLO, in coordination with all affected flights, is responsible for the processing and correctness of the DAY image. 2.61.  Releveling  and  File  Status  Via  Through  Pseudo.  To  process  releveling  and  file  status through the pseudo reader, the following is required: 2.61.1.  Creating a file containing the database keys of the records that require releveling or file status. 2.61.2.  Starting the required process by the DAY image. 2.61.3.  Loading and starting pseudo. 2.62.  File Creation.  To create the file containing releveling or file status keys, see  Para 2.155 for the day image format or enter DAY for display of options.  Program NGV268 will dynamically start  NGV208B,  a  batch  program  that  will  scan  the  item  records  and  select  those  records  that qualify for the selected process.  The database key (in decimal) for each record selected is placed in a record which is written to a sequential file.  After starting NGV208B, program NGV268 will issue  one  of  the  following  management  notices:              312  MGT  NOTICE  -  FILE  STATUS COMPLETED                  Note:        1.    If  FILE  STATUS  processed.                  324  MGT  NOTICE  - RELEVELING COMPLETED          2.  If RELEVELING processed.                      315 MGT NOTICE - LIMITED RELEVELING COMPLETED       3.  If restricted RELEVELING processed. 2.62.1.  After  NGV208B  has  created  the  required  file,  the  following  sample  messages  are produced:            ITEM RECORD SCAN  INITIATED AT 090715 AND  COMPLETED  AT 090919                        TOTAL  RECORDS  SCANNED  FOR  PROCESSING  WAS  13929  FILE CONTAINING 1289        RELEVELING KEYS IS READY FOR PROCESSING ENSURE DAY IMAGE IS RUN TO ENABLE       REQUIREMENTS PROCESSING WHEN READY TO  PROCESS  THRU  PSEUDO  USE  THE PSU1011LOAD 1GV0*LVL-FILE.      FOLLOWING  DATA:                     2.62.2.  If no records were selected, a message to this effect will be produced.  Both files cannot be created at the same time.  Create the LVL-FILE first then the XCS-FILE when both files are required for processing on the same day.  The number of records in either file is always two greater than what  is  shown in  the message produced by NGV208B.   One is  a message (MSG) to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator that processing has AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 93 started and the other is an end of file record.  To obtain a readout of the existing parameters, process a day image with DAY in positions 1 through 3 and 4 through 80 blank. 2.63.  Starting  The  Required  Process.  When  ready  to  start  releveling  or  file  status,  enter  the PSU transaction produced in the message from NGV208B. 2.64.  Terminating Requirements Processing.  When processing releveling or file status through the pseudo reader and you wish to stop the process prior to normal completion, use the console PSU keyin to stop the pseudo from processing.  These transactions will remain on the database in the specified pseudo until the process is restarted.  To restart after stopping the process with a day transaction, the following steps must be followed: 2.64.1.  Start the required pseudo using the PSU transaction that was used originally to start pseudo, but first remove the filename. 2.64.2.  The complete filename is composed of the qualifier and the filename.  The qualifier is four positions long with the gang number as the first character followed by the constant GV0; that is, 1GV0.  The filename used by releveling is LVL-FILE, while XCS-FILE is the filename for file status. 2.64.2.1.  EXAMPLE:  1GV0<ALN>*LVL-FILE. and 1GV0<ALN>*XCS-FILE. Section 2J—-Pseudo Reader 2.65.  Overview.  The  pseudo  reader  is  a  software  feature  which  provides  the  capability  of simulating an input function during online processing.  It was developed to aid the processing of input  images.    The  pseudo  reader  consists  of  the  control  programs,  records,  counters  and  a dedicated area in the SBSS database record area (DBRA) which serves as repository for the inputs to be processed. 2.66.  Pseudo Functions.  Inputs to be processed must first be loaded from images; for example, bench stock, SNUD, status, or via a direct interface by an active program that creates output for subsequent online processing.  Loads to the pseudo reader area create read and write images on system audit tape.  Once loaded, the inputs will remain until processed or deleted.  See Para 2.158 for job stream examples.  Upon successful PSU LOAD, PSU DELETE, and PSU STA processing, an S041 management notice will be typed on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console.    When  total  completion  of  processing  has  been  accomplished,  an  S042  management notice will be typed on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console.  To use the pseudo reader, see Para 2.156 through Para 2.161. Section 2K—-Concurrent Processing 2.67.  Overview.  This section provides concurrent online and reports (end-of-day) processing for the Standard Base Supply System.  Online processing will be terminated in an orderly manner at the  close  of  each  SBSS  business  day,  assuring  completion  of  all  transactions  being  processed, while  reports  processing  against  transactions  for  the  previous  day's  SBSS  business  is  being accomplished. 2.68.  Scope.  SBSS ADS concurrent processing uses a primary and secondary database concept to segregate the SBSS database records when concurrent processing occurs and involves two SBSS business day's transactions.  When concurrent processing is initiated, the primary database records AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 94 are copied to the secondary database, freezing an image of all database records for reports (end-of-day) processing.  To maintain SBSS database integrity, a recovery point is established at this phase in the process via an IRU dump of the secondary database records to tape.  If it becomes necessary to reestablish either the primary or secondary database, this database (IRU) dump may be used as the recovery point.  Once the primary database has been copied successfully, reports that are required to be processed against the primary database are accomplished to close out the current SBSS business day on the primary database. 2.68.1.  Upon  input  of  the  RPTEON  select  image  against  the  primary  database,  full  online transaction processing for the next SBSS business day can be initiated while reports for the previous  SBSS  business  day  are  being  processed  on  the  secondary  database.    To  terminate concurrent  processing,  after  all  required  and  scheduled  reports  have  been  processed successfully on the secondary database, input the RPTEON select image against the secondary database.  All  SBSS database records  and record data  elements  which were updated on the secondary database are merged with the primary database. 2.68.2.  The resulting action allows all updated SBSS database records to reside on the primary database with full recovery capability.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7, S741 through S748 management/reject notices, which pertain to SBSS concurrent processing. 2.69.  Current  Processing  Sequence  and  Edits.  The  major  processing  sequence  of  events required  to  concurrently  process  online  transactions  and  reports  are  contained  in  the  following paragraphs: 2.69.1.  Initiation of Concurrent Processing.  Concurrent processing is initiated by input of the RPTRUN runstream against the primary database (see Para.  2.160).  Edits are performed to ensure that the current SBSS business day's online processing has been terminated in an orderly manner  (END  image  has  been  processed  and  the  special  control  record  002-FLAG-A  field (transaction/batch mode flag) is set to a ]) and the secondary database has not been built for the current SBSS business day (special control record 002-FLAG-S field (secondary database flag) is set to 0).  Before the primary database is copied to the secondary database, the base-constants-1 record on the primary database is checked to ensure that the database being copied is  actually  a  primary  database  set  for  concurrent  processing  mode  (001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG  =  P).    Otherwise,  the  database  copy  action  will  not  occur,  nor  will concurrent processing.  This situation will only occur if the decision has been made to process ALL reports on the primary database prior to the next SBSS business day (online mode) being initiated  (001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG  =  blank). the  001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG is equal to other than blank or P, an S745 reject notice (TYPE database IS INCORRECT) will be generated by program NGV801A.   If 2.69.2.  The  SBSS  employs  the  gang-of-eight  concept  to  support  up  to  four  separate  SBSS accounts  (S/D  01)  on  a  single  computer.    Each  account  is  provided  two  dedicated  gangs:  primary and secondary.  The primary is available for online processing, twilight processing, and  certain  report  programs.    The  secondary  is  used  for  mandatory  and  as-required  report processing.  Gang assignments are as follows: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 95 Table 2.2.  Gang Assignments. PRIMARY GANG SECONDARY GANG 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2.69.3.  During  the  end-of-day  process,  once  online  and  twilight  processing  have  been completed  for  that  processing  date,  the  primary  gang  is  placed  into  the  reports  mode  by processing RPTRUN.  The RPTRUN checks the ITMDTL area on the secondary gang.  If it is cataloged, the ACOPY process is activated.  If it is not cataloged, NGV898 will then catalog it and then start ACOPY, copying the primary gang to the secondary, changing the database keys  to  reflect  the  secondary  area  codes.    RPTRUN  puts  the  primary  gang  into  the  reports mode,  and  the  primary  is  then  available  for  processing.    A  dump  is  then  performed  on  the secondary.  Since the secondary is an exact copy of the primary, this dump can be reloaded to the primary or secondary if recovery becomes necessary.  If this dump is used to reload the secondary  database,  it  will  be  necessary  to  run  NGV299  to  set  the  001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG to equal a secondary database (flag = S) since the flag is not set to an S by  program  NGV898C  until  after  the  secondary  dump  is  taken.    If  the  002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED  field  equals  a  1,  the  D37  is  executed  and  a  subsequent  dump  of  primary areas CT-OWNR, CT-CTRL, and CT-HIST is performed. 2.69.4.  Secondary Database Build.  During the secondary database build process, the primary database records areas are downed to ensure that no transaction processing occurs while the primary database records are being copied to the secondary database.  An S741 management notice (PRIMARY TO SECONDARY database BUILD IS IN PROGRESS) is generated by program NGV898C to inform the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console operator  that  transaction  processing  is  suspended  pending  completion  of  the  primary  to secondary database copy. 2.69.5.  Consolidated  Transaction  History  (CTH)  Tape  Dump.    The  record  field  002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag is checked for a 1 (one).  If the 1 (one) is present, a tape dump of the primary  CT-OWNR,  CT-HIST  and  CT-CTRL  areas  (CTH  areas)  will  be  executed  when position 79 and 80 of the primary RPTRUN input image are blank.  All host LRS / materiel management  activity  accounts  will  process  the  daily  RPTRUN  with  a  B  in  position  79  to bypass the CTH during crossover.  The S747 management notice (AFMC SCM-R Information Technology  Activity  OPERATOR  ELECTED  TO  OMIT  PRIMARY  CTH  AREA  TAPE DUMP)  is  generated  by  program  NGV898C  to  notify  the  LGLO  that  a  tape  dump  of  the primary CTH area did not occur on the daily run of RPTRUN.  Once a week, all host LRS / materiel management activity accounts will process RPTRUN with a blank in position 79 to create the CTH dump during crossover.  The weekly CTH dump should be processed after the NDA500 “ALL” option to include the CTH area.  A second dump of the CTH area should be avoided if the current CTH database is already dumped to tape.  When an * (asterisk) is present in position 80 of the primary RPTRUN input image, the tape dump of the secondary database AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 96 and the tape dump of the primary CTH areas will be bypassed.  When this occurs, an S743 management  notice  (AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  OPERATOR ELECTED  TO  OMIT  THE  STANDARD  DATABASE  DUMP)  and  an  S747  management notice  are generated. Note: Costly recoveries can be avoided by closely monitoring the size and the number of months maintained in the CTH area.  To maintain the size of your CTH database, process UTL041 and UTL042 in accordance with Ch 3.  Always ensure a CTH dump is processed prior to processing UTL041 and UTL042.  In the event a recovery is required, follow the instructions in Ch 3. 2.69.6.  Special Control Record.  The special  control  record 002-FLAG-S field  is  set  to a 1 (secondary database is active prior to BOD on the primary database).  An S742 management notice  (PRIMARY  database  IS  NOW  AVAILABLE  FOR  PROCESSING)  is  generated  by program NGV898C to inform the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator that processing can continue against the primary database.  In addition, the second line of print on  the  S742  management  notice  will  read:    SECONDARY  DATABASE  WILL  NOW  BE DUMPED TO TAPE, unless the database (IRU) dump bypass option is selected (RPTRUN image, position 80 = ’*’).  Only your MAJCOM or AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity can authorize the bypass option.  After all required and scheduled reports have been processed include 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x,  and  input  of  the  RPTEON  image,  the  primary database may be initialized for the next SBSS business day (online mode). successfully primary database, to on the 2.69.7.  SBSS  Database  Integrity.    At  the  beginning  of  each  concurrent  processing  day,  the secondary database is dumped to tape via IRU.  Coupled with the DMC system audit tapes, the primary or secondary database may be recovered independently, to any desired recovery point, without affecting other users of the SBSS ADS.  The actual database dump occurs as a result of the RPTRUN image/runstream input (unless the database dump bypass option is selected).  If the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator selects this option, an S743 management  notice  (AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  OPERATOR  TO OMIT  THE  STANDARD  database  DUMP)  is  generated  by  program  NGV898C  to  notify Management and System Officer that the database dump did not occur.  Extreme caution must be used when this option is selected, since the recovery start point will then be the last database dump taken and the tape dump of the primary CTH areas are bypassed.  Bypass of the database dump and tape dump of the primary CTH areas is not authorized without prior approval from the host MAJCOM or Supply Systems Control Center. 2.69.8.  Secondary Database Processing.  After the secondary database has been built and the database (IRU) dump (if taken) is completed, the 001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG is set to an S.  All areas of the secondary database are then ready for reports processing.  At this point in  the  concurrent  processing,  an  S744  management  notice  (SECONDARY  DATABASE  IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR PROCESSING) will be generated by program NGV898C.  After the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  operator  has  completed  these  actions, process  database  pointer  verification  on  the  secondary  database  by  keying  in  the  following command statement:                @XQT DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500              Note: Take applicable option as outlined in Ch 3.  This must be executed in order to audit the database dump in the event it becomes necessary to reload the database records to either the primary or secondary  database  for  recovery  purposes.    Normal  reports  processing  can  then  resume according to AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 97 2.69.9.  Secondary to Primary Database Update.  After all required and scheduled reports have been processed successfully against the secondary database, and it is desired to close out the reports processing day, the RPTEON image is processed against the secondary database.  This will overlay records and record fields that were updated from the secondary reports.  Special control record data fields updated at this point are: 2.69.9.1.  002-FLAG-S is set to an asterisk (*) on the secondary database (RPTEON has been processed on the secondary database). 2.69.9.2.  002-FLAG-S is updated on the primary database.  If 002-FLAG-S = 1, indicating the primary database is still in reports mode, 002-FLAG-S is set to a 2.  If 002-FLAG-S = 2,  indicating  that  RPTEON  has  been  processed  and  BOD  has  occurred  on  the  primary database, 002-FLAG-S is set to 0 (secondary database inactive). 2.69.10.  S746  Reject  Notice.    An  S746  reject  notice  (REPORTS  HAVE  NOT  BEEN COMPLETED  ON  THE  SECONDARY  database)  will  be  output  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity console for the following conditions: 2.69.10.1.  The  RPTRUN  image  has  been  processed  against  the  primary  database.    The RPTEON  image  has  not  been  processed  against  the  secondary  database.    (The  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console operator is attempting to initiate the next SBSS processing (reports mode) day prior to completion of the current processing day.) 2.69.10.2.  The RPTRUN image has been processed against the primary database, but BOD has  not  been  initiated;  however,  the  RPTEON  image  has  been  processed  against  the secondary  database.    (The  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  console operator  must  process  the  RPTEON  select  image  against  the  primary  database.)    The generation  of  the  S746  reject  notice  will  prevent  any  attempt  to  allow  two  concurrent processing’s to occur at the same time and prevents any damage to the primary database reports sequence control record to result after RPTEON has been processed on the primary database. 2.70.  Restart Procedures.  The following events should be analyzed when attempting to restart specific jobs during concurrent processing: 2.70.1.  RPTRUN.    During  the  initiation  of  concurrent  processing,  both  the  primary  and secondary databases are down (inaccessible) from processing while the secondary database is being built.  If an operating system failure occurs during this time frame, it will be necessary to process the following runstream to UP the primary database record areas: 2.70.1.1.  @ADD,L 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.UP/GV-x  (x = applicable gang) 2.70.2.  Reinput the RPTRUN Runstream.  This will cause the primary to secondary database build process to reinitiate. 2.70.3.  Secondary Database Dump in Progress.  If an operating system failure occurs, initiate the  standard  database  dump  against  the  secondary  database.    Ensure  record  field  001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG is equal to S.  If not, use NGV299 to correctly set the 001-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLAG to S.  Resume normal processing. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 98 2.70.4.  RPTEON Processing on the Secondary Database.  If an operating system failure occurs during  this  time  frame,  correct  the  error  condition  and  reinput  the  RPTEON  runstream.  RPTEON on the secondary database overlays data; it does not update. 2.71.  Recovery  Procedures.  In  the  event  it  becomes  necessary  to  recover  database  areas  on either the primary or secondary database, a thorough research must be accomplished prior to any attempt to recover the database.  Since there are too many conditions to describe, each recovery situation  may  be  unique  to  itself.    The  different  types  of  recoveries  may  require  STR  (Supply Transaction Recovery) or IRU reloads of the database, audit trail tape recovery or any combination of the three. 2.72.  IRU Dumps During Extended Online Processing.  When an online processing session is continued  for  more  than  the  normal  processing  day,  an  IRU  dump  should  be  taken  during  this session.  This dump should be taken at approximately the same time the normal end-of-day would have  occurred.    This  dump  would  serve  to  significantly  shorten  recovery  time  in  the  event  a recovery is later required.  This dump should always be followed by a verification of the database.  There must be no READ errors on dump  tapes.  The difference between a READ and WRITE error is the WRITE error will cause the tape to back-up and recheck the last write action.  In other words, if the tape’s read and write is okay then you have a good tape.  If the tape’s read is okay and a write error occurs, then the tape may still be okay, however, caution must be used if these are excessive.  If the tape’s read is bad, then the read error is unacceptable.  Thus, READ errors cannot be read by IRU or ACOPY.  Consequently, any recovery attempted with these tapes may not be successful. Section 2L—-Operating Procedures 2.73.  Overview.  This section contains a screen format for each TRIC/DIC that is authorized for input by this manual.  Also available is a GENERAL PURPOSE SCREEN, which can be used to enter  data  for  any  TRIC/DIC.    Screen  displays  consist  of  24  lines,  and  each  line  contains  80 character  positions.    Lines  1-20  display  data  fields;  information  is  entered  in  these  fields  by personnel.  Lines 21-24 display reject and management notices.  These notices are automatically printed by the computer when they exceed the three display lines. 2.74.  Terminal  Sign-On/Sign-Off  Procedures.  Before  you  can  sign  on  to  the  computer,  you must take the following actions.  Remember, as the microcomputer technology changes so will these procedures.                        Turn on the terminal.                            Turn on the printer.                    Load the computer with the forms that you will need.                          Check the page number displayed in the lower left corner of your screen.        The screen is referred to as the visual display unit (terminal) throughout the remainder of this section.          Note: The page number is displayed, and then continue by taking the following appropriate actions: 2.74.1.  If the page number is one, take the following actions: 2.74.1.1.  Press the CONTROL PAGE function key.  The following display will appear on your  terminal:                          (**PRINT*)STA-    (**XFER*)PRNT  (PRNT)  XFER(ALL) XMIT(CHAN)MM (PARAM)                   ( /P1/ )ADR- ( / / )SEARCH (                 ) ( / )             Note: If the display on your terminal is different from the display above, you must enter the correct data before proceeding.  For additional guidance, see UP (Unisys  Publication) 9142, Terminal Operators Guide. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 99 2.74.1.2.  Press the CONTROL PAGE function key when the control page parameters are correct.  The control page parameters will disappear. 2.74.2.  If the page number is two, take the following actions: 2.74.2.1.  Press the PAGE function key.  Page number one will now be displayed in the lower left corner of your terminal. 2.74.2.2.  Press the XMIT function key to begin the sign-on procedure.  Your terminal will display this message:  ENTER USER-ID/PASSWORD. 2.74.3.  Enter your USER-ID/PASSWORD.  You have only three tries to enter your USER-ID/PASSWORD.  However, if you have automatic sign-on implemented, then you only have two tries to enter your USER-ID/PASSWORD.  In either case, if you incorrectly enter your USER-ID/PASSWORD in all tries, the system will deactivate your terminal (your PID for the terminal will be marked down).  If your terminal is deactivated, you must contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator before you can proceed.  The purpose of the USER-ID and PASSWORD is as follows: 2.74.3.1.  Your USER-ID is a unique word or code that prevents unauthorized users from gaining  access  to  your  files.  Although  entered,  your USER-ID will not  appear on  your terminal. 2.74.3.2.  Your PASSWORD is  a unique  word or code that identifies  you as the person seeking to use the computer. 2.74.3.3.  Press  the XMIT function key.   When  your USER-ID/PASSWORD have been accepted by the computer, the SYSTEM MENU SCREEN will appear on your terminal. 2.74.3.4.  Press the TAB function key until the cursor is positioned at the first input position of the SCREEN MENU # field. 2.74.3.5.  Enter the screen number or screen name of your choice. 2.74.3.6.  Press the XMIT function key.  The screen requested will be displayed on your terminal.   Note: If you leave the SCREEN MENU # field blank and then press the XMIT function key, the MAIN MENU SCREEN will be displayed on your terminal. 2.74.4.  Terminal Shut-Down Procedures.  Take the following actions: 2.74.4.1.  Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key. 2.74.4.2.  Enter $$CLOSE after the SOE prompt >. 2.74.4.3.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.74.4.4.  Press the SOE function key. 2.74.4.5.  Enter $$SOFF after the SOE prompt >. 2.74.4.6.  Press the XMIT function key.  Your terminal is now shut down. 2.74.5.  Single  and  Multiscreens.    The  SBSS  uses  two  kinds  of  screens,  single  screens  and multiscreens, which are defined as follows: 2.74.5.1.  Single Screens.  These screens use one screen input to complete a transaction.  For example, a new item record load can be processed with the screen name FIL and the AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 100 screen number 442.  All data needed to process this transaction must be entered into the screen before they are transmitted from the terminal to the computer. 2.74.5.2.  Multiscreens.  These screens use two screen inputs to process a transaction.  The first screen is an inquiry screen, which collects data from stored detail records.  The second screen is built from these collected data.  Transactions are processed with the minimum number of data entry requirements.  An example of a multiscreen is as follows:  first screen--#INQ REC (screen name), or #058 (screen number); second screen--#REC/059. 2.75.  Menus.  When you do not know the specific name or number of a screen, and it is not listed in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, you can still call the screen to your terminal by working through a list of program choices (menus).  You must enter a choice from each menu until the desired screen appears on your terminal.  There are four types of menus, defined below. 2.75.1.  System Menu.  Use this menu to call any screen used by the computer to your terminal.  The  System  Menu  is  first  displayed  on  your  terminal  just  after  you  enter  your  USER-ID/PASSWORD when you sign on to the computer.  To recall this menu to your terminal at any time, take these actions: 2.75.1.1.  Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key. 2.75.1.2.  Enter MENU after the SOE prompt >. 2.75.1.3.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.75.2.  Main Menu.  This menu displays major screen topics.  You may call this menu to your terminal  by  selecting  it  from  the  System  Menu  or,  select  the  Main  Menu  by  taking  the following actions: 2.75.2.1.  Press the SOE function key. 2.75.2.2.  Enter  #MAINMENU  (screen  name),  or  #001  (screen  number)  after  the  SOE prompt >. 2.75.2.3.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.75.3.  Topic Menu.  This menu groups similar functions by topic name.  For example, turn-in screens are listed in topic menu # TURNIN; issue screens in # ISSUE.  Major screen topics are listed on the Main Menu.  To call a screen topic to your terminal, take the following actions: 2.75.3.1.  Move the cursor to the topic of your choice. 2.75.3.2.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.75.4.  Specific  Topic  Menu.    This  menu  lists  topic  screens  under  the  topic  name,  such  as ISSUES.  The Specific Topic Menu also provides for each screen its name and a description of how it is used.  For example, the menu provides the following information:  # ISUCE Civil Engineering issue, type org code A or B non-MICAP.  Specific topics are listed on the Topic Menu.  To call a specific topic to your terminal, take these actions: 2.75.4.1.  Move the cursor to the specific topic of your choice. 2.75.4.2.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.76.  Selecting Specific Screens For Display.  You can call a specific screen to  your terminal whether or not you know the screen's name or number.  Take the appropriate actions, as follows: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 101 2.76.1.  Screen's Name or Number Is Known.  Before you can call a specific screen to your terminal, you must first obtain the screen's name or number from AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2.  Screen names are directly related to a TRIC/DIC and its intended use.  For example, #ISUCE is  the screen name for an issue request  for Civil  Engineering.  Once  you have obtained the screen's name or number, take the following actions: 2.76.1.1.  Move the cursor to the first open screen line. 2.76.1.2.  Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key. 2.76.1.3.  Enter the screen's name (#ISUCE) or number (#085) after the SOE prompt >. 2.76.1.4.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.76.2.  Screen's Name or Number Is Not Known.  If you do not know the specific name or number of a screen, and it is not listed in AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2,  you can still call the screen to your terminal.  You must work through a list of program choices (menus). 2.77.  Entering and Transmitting Data (Types of Data).  A displayed screen contains two types of data, protected and unprotected, which are defined as follows: 2.77.1.  Protected Data.  This data is already entered and you cannot change it.  For example, the screen name, screen number, and data field name are protected data. 2.77.2.  Unprotected Data.  You can enter and change this data.  For example, the prepositioned initial value data (data entered on the screen by the computer) and the information that you enter in each field are unprotected data. 2.77.3.  Entering Data.  When you call a detail screen to your terminal, the cursor moves to the first character position of the first field in which you will enter data.  As you enter data in a field, the cursor advances from left to right.  When you have entered the maximum number of characters in a field, the cursor automatically moves to the first character position of the next field on your terminal.  If you do not enter enough characters in a field to fill it, you must press the TAB function key to advance the cursor to the next field. 2.77.4.  Transmitting  Data.    When  you  have  entered  a  certain  amount  of  data  and  want  it registered in the computer, you must press the XMIT function key.  Data which precede the SOE prompt > or follow the cursor are not transmitted.  If an SOE prompt is not visible on your  terminal,  all  unprotected  data  from  the  top  left  corner  of  your  terminal  (home  cursor position) to the cursor character position are registered in the computer when  you press the XMIT function key. 2.77.5.  Refreshing  the  Screen.    A  screen  feature  exists  to  bring  back  the  input  data  on  the screen.  This occurs whether the transaction processed or not.  On top of the screen where the screen number is shown (i.e., /058), simply replace the slash (/) with an R (i.e., R058) and then enter the data that you want to reprocess. 2.78.  Special  Screen  Functions.  After  you  have  transmitted  data  from  your  terminal  to  the computer and that input has been processed, your screen will be refreshed.  In other words, the last screen you used before transmitting the data is redisplayed on your terminal under program control.  When you press the PRINT function key, data on your terminal between the last Start-of-Entry prompt (>) and the current  cursor position is  printed.   If  an SOE prompt is  not  visible on  your terminal, data from the top left corner of your terminal (home cursor position) to the current cursor AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 102 position is printed.  Data entered in quantity fields is right-justified.  When the data entered does not fill all the character positions, the field is zero-filled.  Under these circumstances, do not enter leading zeros in the field. 2.79.  Error Notices.  Correctable Reject/Management Notices. 2.79.1.  Operator  Correctable  Errors.    The  errors  represented  by  the  following  SBSS reject/management notices can be corrected by you.  These notices are defined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7.  Refer to your reject notice file 0GV00000*REJNOT. for applicable rejects. 2.79.2.  Correcting an error. 2.79.2.1.  Move the cursor to the field that contains the error. 2.79.2.2.  Enter the correct data. 2.79.2.3.  Move the cursor past the last data field used in the screen. 2.79.2.4.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.79.3.  Displaying  a  New  Screen.    To  display  a  new  screen,  you  must  take  the  following actions.  If an empty screen line is available, take these actions: 2.79.3.1.  Move the cursor to an empty screen line. 2.79.3.2.  Press the START-OF-ENTRY (SOE) function key. 2.79.3.3.  Enter the # screen name or # screen number after the SOE prompt >. 2.79.3.4.  Press the XMIT function key. 2.79.3.5.  If an empty screen line IS NOT AVAILABLE, take these actions: 2.79.3.6.  Clear the terminal by pressing the CURSOR TO HOME function key. 2.79.3.7.  Press  twice  simultaneously  the  UPPER  function  key  and  the  ERASE  DIS function key. 2.79.3.8.  Non-operator correctable reject/management notices.  Reject notices other than those listed above are printed automatically under program control.  The screen you used last will then reappear on your terminal. 2.79.3.9.  System  Error  Notices.    In  addition  to  the  SBSS  reject/management  notices defined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 the following system error notices may result when you attempt to call a screen to your terminal: 2.79.3.9.1.  Invalid Screen Request.  This error notice appears on your terminal when you have entered an invalid screen name or number. 2.79.3.9.2.  Screen Not Yet Implemented.  This error notice appears on your terminal when  you have entered  a screen name that is  listed on a menu, but  which is  not  yet ready for use. 2.79.3.9.3.  ****System error nn, field xx, name yyyy.  This error message gives you the following information: 2.79.3.9.3.1.  nn = The error number (see the chart below). 2.79.3.9.3.2.  xx = The field that contains the error. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 103 2.79.3.9.3.3.  yyyy = The first four characters of the screen's name. 2.79.3.10.  Error  Numbers.    If  one  of  the  following  error  numbers  is  displayed  on  your terminal, verify and then reenter the data containing the error.  If you receive the same error message  again,  you  must  contact  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity operator and describe the error before proceeding. Table 2.3.  Error Numbers. ERROR NUMBER  DESCRIPTION 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 Error on read of DPS TIP Screen File. Field is not an I/O field. I/O field is not alpha, numeric, or alphanumeric. Field name does not begin with FD, ND, or SD. Field name FDnn, NDnn, or SDnn, where nn is not a two-digit number from 01-80. Field length is not in range of 01-80 characters. Computed starting field position and length places data beyond the 80-character image. Section 2M—-Tape Management 2.80.  Overview.  Tape  management  is  an  important  aspect  of  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity operations.  By operating with faulty tapes, valuable computer data may be lost in the event that recovery of this data is necessary.  Numerous amounts of write errors or any read errors should be researched and corrected as soon as possible.  The cataloging of tapes on the system provides a tracking mechanism for identification of specific tape reel numbers to specific file-IDS.  It also provides for automatically requesting the host DMC operator to mount the correct tape number(s) when/if a magnetic tape file-ID is used as input on a subsequent runstream. 2.81.  Cataloged Files.  As with all other DMC cataloged files, the ability to cycle these tape files exist.  From 1 to 32 cycles may be retained in the master file directory (MFD).  These cycles may be referenced as the following examples depict: 2.81.1.  @PRT,F A*A.  This would produce a printout of the MFD information associated with the current cycle of file A*A.  This would include tape reel numbers if it were a cataloged tape file. 2.81.2.  @PRT,F A*A(-1).  This would produce a printout of the MFD information associated with  the  minus  one  generation  or  cycle  (the  cycle  immediately  preceding  the  current generation). 2.81.3.  @PRT,F A*A(7).  This would produce a printout of the MFD information associated with a specific file cycle, cycle number 7. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 104 2.81.4.  Additional  information  on file cycling may  be  found in  UP  4144, EXEC  SYSTEM PROGRAMMER REFERENCE.  If a type file catalog entry is deleted or lost by a recovery process, the catalog entry for a tape file may be reestablished by using the following processes.  These  processes  should  be  used  only  when  the  MFD  entry  recording  the  tape's  current utilization has been lost and the physical tape reel(s) themselves have not been destroyed or written over.  If the correct tape reel numbers are known, then enter: 2.81.4.1.  @CAT,PV qualifier*filename(+1).,U9,xxx/yyy..../zzz             Note:  Where xxx, yyy, and zzz are replaced by the appropriate tape reel numbers. 2.82.  Tape Accountability.  Accurate tape accountability procedures must be followed to ensure positive control over tape input/output within the SBSS ADS on the DMC.  Manual records must be  available  for  research  and  recovery.    Although  AF  Form  2006,  Tape  Utilization  Log, is  not mandatory,  recommend  using  a  formal  log  to  keep  track  of  all  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity tape requirements. 2.83.  Tape Records.  Historical data on all tapes produced on the DMC are the responsibility of the DMC chief.  All tapes used by LRS / materiel management activity  are recorded in the System for Tape Administration and Reporting (STAR), 1100 tape library system.  It is not mandatory to record tape numbers on AF Form 2006; however, a formal log will make a quick reference for input/output tape utilization.  There are four methods to obtain tape file information. 2.83.1.  @PRT,F on tape filename (if cataloged tape file). 2.83.2.  @ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.TAPE-NBR/GV-x  .x equals gang 2.83.2.1.  By manually executing the IRU processor: 2.83.2.1.1.  @IRU 2.83.2.1.2.  REPORT HISTORY DUMPS FILES DMS$<ALN>*ITMDTL-GV-1.; 2.83.2.1.3.  ACT; 2.83.2.1.4.  @EOF or audit trail history reporting, keyin the following: 2.83.2.1.5.  @IRU 2.83.2.1.6.  Report ACI ALL; ACT; 2.83.2.1.7.  -or- 2.83.2.1.8.  Report ACI Last 10; ACT; 2.83.2.1.9.  @EOF 2.84.  IRU Dumps.  The IRU process is the only tool used by the SBSS to dump the database.  This provides backup security for both the primary and secondary gangs.  There is a runstream available in 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. to dump the database:  IRUDUMP/GV-x.  All dump tape numbers and audit trail tape numbers are stored in IRU history files (see Para.  2.165 for dumps and  Para  2.167  for  audit  tapes).    Also,  you  may  elect  to  process  IRU  dumps  with  the  DUMP CHANGES options.  See UP (Unisys publication) 7830 8194-000 for the DUMP CHANGES and RELOAD CHANGES options. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 105 2.85.  EXEC Files.  The recovery of cataloged disk files which are not under the control of the DMS 1100 (Database Management System) are supported using a variety of procedures.  These procedures are described below: 2.85.1.  The simplest of procedures is the processing of a standard SBSS runstream which re-creates  the  file  to  be  recovered.    The  files  this  procedure  applies  to  and  the  runstreams  to process are documented in Para 2.163.  To re-create a file, prior to processing a runstream, verify that the files necessary to process the runstream as documented in Para 2.164 are present on the system. 2.85.2.  A  second  procedure  used  to  backup  disk  files  and  provide  a  recovery  capability  is provided  by  the  host  DMC.    This  is  accomplished  by  the  host  DMC  via  a  standard  utility referred  to  as  the  File  Administrative  Processor  (FAS).    The  local  DMC  is  responsible  for establishing dates and times when files are backed up via the @FAS process.  Coordination between the Supply Systems Monitor and the host DMC should be accomplished to determine what files will be saved and the frequency the @FAS process will be accomplished. 2.85.3.  The third method used to provide disk file backup capability is provided via standard SBSS  runstreams.    These  runstreams  use  standard  Executive  Control  Language  (ECL), specifically @COPY,GM to create backup tapes for files retained on disk.  These backup tapes are created as a secondary backup measure. 2.85.4.  If it becomes necessary to recover a file listed in Para 2.163 and it cannot be re-created by processing a standard runstream, the primary means of recovery should be to request the host DMC recover the file from the latest saveall tape.  However, it should be verified that the date/time of the @FAS backup tape to be used in the recovery operation is subsequent to the backup  tapes  created  by  processing  the  applicable  SBSS  runstreams.    If  the  SBSS  created backup tape is the most current of the two backup tape sources, the file should be recovered from the SBSS created backup tape.  Para 2.163 defines processing frequency and recovery processes using the backup procedures listed in this paragraph. 2.86.  ACOPY Processing Instructions.  ACOPY is used to reload a dump to a gang other than the gang that was originally dumped.  It is also used anytime you wish to delete the database prior to reloading a particular gang.  Also, ACOPY is the only way you can cross gangs with a database dump.  ACOPY converts the DBK of each record to the correct area, page, and record.  Prior to starting  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.ACOPY,  element  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SGS  must  be modified to pass the gang number dumped on the tape and the gang number you wish to recover. 2.86.1.  The  first  IRU  tape  number  must  also  be  provided.    An  example  of  element  SGS follows: 2.86.1.1.  >ACOPY GANG Y TO Z 2.86.1.2.  >FIRST IRU TAPE IS XXXXXX 2.86.1.3.  If gang five was dumped on tape number B00024, and you want to reload it to gang one, simply change Y to equal gang five, Z to equal gang one, and XXXXXX to equal B00024.  For multiple reels,  separate with  a /B00999/B08888/B0777.  The following is one example of a ACOPY runstream: 2.86.1.3.1.  >@RUN,A ACOPY,,xGV0                 . x = gang number AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 106 2.86.1.3.2.  >@SYM   PRINT$.,,RPS08              . queue out PR 2.86.1.3.3.  >@QUAL  DMS$<ALN>                   . your ALN 2.86.1.3.4.  >@SSG  ,0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SGS         . gang and tape 2.86.1.3.5.  >SKEL 2.86.1.3.6.  >#MSG  ACOPY  FROM  GV  GANG  [ACOPY,1,2,1]  TO  GV  GANG [ACOPY,1,4,1] 2.86.1.3.7.  >#MSG ** STARTING IRU TAPE IS [FIRST,1,4,1]  BY: user 2.86.1.3.8.  >#ADD,L 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-[ACOPY,1,4,1] 2.86.1.3.9.  >#ADD,L 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV[ACOPY,1,4,1] 2.86.1.3.10.  >#ADD,L 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.CAT[ACOPY,1,4,1] 2.86.1.3.11.  >#ASG,TF 0V0*SBSSAV[ACOPY,1,2,1].,U9,[FIRST,1,4,1],1800 2.86.1.3.12.  >#DMS$0000*DBALIB$.ACOPY,IC SCHEMA.SBSS-SCHEMA DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-2.86.1.3.13.  >IRU TAPE 0GV0*SBSSAV[ACOPY,1,2,1].

Processing  Logic.    ACOPY  downs,  deletes,  catalogs,  copies,  and  then  it  ups  the particular database being recovered.  It then reads the dump tape, copying the areas from the tape to disk.  When recovering to a gang other than the gang that was dumped, ACOPY reads the database keys of the records on the dump and changes the area codes to equate to the gang being reloaded prior to copying the areas. 2.87.  Supply Transaction Recovery (STR).  The prime method of recovering the SBSS database is with the Integrated Recovery Utility (IRU) recover command.  The major causes of a STR results either  from  bad  tapes  or  improper  operating  procedures.    If  an  excessive  amount  of  read/write errors persist on output tapes, the tape librarian must be notified.  In the case of improper operating procedures,  training  will  eliminate  this  problem.    However,  there  are  cases  where  a  STR  is necessary. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 107 2.88.  STR  Coordination.  It  is  imperative  that  the  DECC,    AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology  Activity,  Accounting  and  Finance,  and  LRS  /  materiel  management  activity  personnel, AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, MAJCOM all become very involved prior  to  and  during  this  procedure.    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  personnel  from  each  area assemble together to review these procedures and work together to ensure the database is rebuilt in a correct and stable manner.  If bad or unreadable tapes are encountered, STR will abort.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must then utilize ATTANL to print the area on the tape where the error occurred.  Close analysis to the ATTANL printout is needed to extract the last good time a transaction was created both before and after the tape error.  This will require the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity personnel to use extreme caution in generating each of the recovery input files. 2.88.1.  Special  Note.    Bases  should  consider  at  this  point  using  times  slots  to  build  the recovery files to limit the number of inputs in each file.  If you elect this option, when you get an  end-of-job  for  NGVU60,  the  files  should  be  copied  into  another  file  (that  is, xGV0*TXFILE. copied into xGV0*TX1.) for the first run.  Filenames should be unique in all cases.  STR uses local time for input but converts this to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) from the tape. 2.88.2.  STR Recovery Process.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity room will  determine  the  start  and  stop  times  necessary  for  the  STR  recovery  and  reestablish  the SBSS database up to the time that the STR will be required.  That is, RELOAD back a clean and valid database dump and if necessary, audit trail recover up to the start of STR.  Once the database is ready, IRUDUMP, process NDA500, and STR all audit trail tapes required, hold the  output  files  for  the  Degraded  Operations  team.    The  Degraded  Operations  team  will assemble and review the output listing for validity and sequencing of inputs.  Once the file(s) are  ready  for  input,  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  will  pseudo  load these images, hold all rejects for the Degraded Operations team.  Under no circumstance should these images be replayed without a person or persons having an in-depth knowledge about the SBSS. 2.88.3.  STR  Versus  IRU  Recovery.    One  important  note;  once  you  have  started  a  STR recovery,  you must finish with a STR recovery.  You cannot process STR, IRU, then STR.  These will leave you with an invalid database. 2.89.  File Usage. 2.89.1.  The following files must be present for STR to operate correctly: 2.89.1.1.  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. contains all the necessary ECL runstreams to start and execute NGV291, STR EDITOR. 2.89.1.2.  0GV00000*DBALIB$. contains all the absolutes necessary to execute the jobs involved with the STR process. 2.89.1.3.  TIP$*SCRNF177. contains all the SBSS tip screen formats. 2.89.2.  The work files created during the execution of NGVU60 are as follows: 2.89.2.1.  x equals primary gang. 2.89.2.2.  xGV0*REL-D-FILE AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 108 2.89.2.3.  xGV0*REL-K-FILE 2.89.2.4.  xGV0*901-D-FILE 2.89.2.5.  xGV0*901-K-FILE 2.89.2.6.  xGV0*TXFILE 2.89.2.7.  xGV0*1BS-TXFILE 2.89.2.8.  xGV0*NGVU60-PRT 2.89.2.9.  xGV0*NGVU60-SUM 2.89.2.10.  xGV0*NGVU60-901 2.90.  Description  and  Operating  Procedures.  The  following  information  provides  sufficient operating instructions to allow the user to recover an SBSS database in the event of failure in the IRU process. 2.90.1.  Description.  The first step in the STR recovery is to execute NGVU60 from an AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  demand  terminal.    NGVU60  reads  the  audit  trail tape or tapes and creates a work file (xGV0*TXFILE.) containing SBSS transactions that are to  be  replayed  using  the  SBSS  pseudo  reader.    NGVU60  creates  three  different  print  files.  They are as follows: 2.90.1.1.  The Detail Print Report (xGV0*NGVU60-PRT.).  This is a listing of inputs.  This report lists additional information about each transaction such as the input PID, date and time, and the audit trail STEP-ID of the original input message.  The audit trail STEP-ID is a method the audit trail logging process uses to tie a different process associated with one  step  or  message  together.    By  using  the  STEP-ID  (a  12-position  number),  901 transaction  histories  can  be  researched  in  the  901  portion  of  the  printed  listing.    All transactions created by an input will have the same STEP-ID.  The 901 portion is output in STEP-ID sequence. 2.90.1.2.  The Summary Print Report (xGV0*NGVU60-SUM.).  This is a summary of all audit  trail  tapes  as  they  are  read.    Information  on  previous,  current,  and  next  audit  trail numbers, date and time mounted and demounted, and number of records read are shown. 2.90.1.3.  The Transaction History Report.  This report lists each 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY record logged on the audit trail tape during the specified recovery period.  The user can tie transaction histories listed on the report back to the original input listed on the Detail Print Report with the STEP-ID. 2.90.2.  Delete File.  NGVU60 creates a delete file.  This file is used to delete all work files once the recovery is complete.  This job should be started by the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console operator once notified the STR recovery has been completed and the SBSS ADS is back online and operational. 2.90.3.  TIP File 177.  NGVU60 uses the TIP$*SCRNF177. as an index to rebuild the image from  a  screen  format  into  an  input  image.    Since  TIP$*SCRNF177.  is  always  the  current screens you have loaded, NGVU60 will format these images with the correct fields. 2.90.4.  Editing Output.  The next step in the STR process is the editing of the transaction file (xGV0*TXFILE.).  The user will use NGV291 to edit this file.  Note:  Do not attempt to use AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 109 conversational time sharing (cts) or editor for the review.  These processes will truncate data of any input that is greater than 80/320 characters.  After all appropriate corrected transactions have been added to the transaction file, the transactions may be split into small files so they can be replayed through the SBSS pseudo.  Once all transactions have been recovered, the user should perform whatever post-processing is  necessary to  determine if  a successful database has been recovered.  NGV291 will be explained in detail later in this chapter. 2.90.5.  Operating Instructions.  The following information is intended to provide the user with a detailed discussion of each of the steps of the STR process: 2.90.5.1.  STR requires specific information to perform the above functions.  To use STR, the ALN (access location number), the ADS-ID (1GV, 2GV, 3GV or 4GV), the beginning and ending audit trail tape number(s), the starting and ending times, and the output print queue for the recovery period will be required.  It is imperative that this information be gathered and is accurate PRIOR to start of the recovery process. 2.90.5.2.  ALN.  Due to multiple gangs being stacked on the same ALN, you must know which ALN  you are assigned.   The command @WHOAMI  will determine this for  you.  You cannot use the ALN 0000, since this is an exempt ALN; you will pull transactions not belonging to your particular ALN or gang.  You must be signed on to your ALN to process STR. 2.90.5.3.  ADS-ID.    This  is  a  three-character  identification  code  of  the  ADS  being recovered.  The first position of the ADS-ID is the gang number (1 through 4 only).  The last two positions are the constant GV, which denote SBSS transactions only. 2.90.5.4.  Start/End Date/Time.  Since the DMC operates on local and GMT (Greenwich Meantime) it is imperative you use local versus GMT time.  The audit trail tape will record the transactions under GMT.  Be sure of your start/stop date and times BEFORE executing the STR process.  NGVU60 will query for local start/stop times. 2.90.5.5.  Beginning/Ending Audit Trail Numbers.  The audit trail numbers must consist of a six-position input reel number.  Audit trail research must be accomplished in a correct manner.    IRU  can  give  you  the  most  accurate  listing  of  the  audit  trail  report.    Use  the following to display audit trail tapes: 2.90.5.5.1.  @IRU                                            activate IRU processor 2.90.5.5.2.  REPORT ACI ALL; ACT;            or REPORT ACI LAST 15; 2.90.5.5.3.  ACT;                                              execute IRU commands 2.90.5.5.4.  @EOF                                            exit IRU 2.90.5.5.5.  Use the following to display all audit trail tapes numbers: 2.90.5.5.5.1.  @IRU                                            activate IRU processor 2.90.5.5.5.2.  REPORT AUDIT ALL; ACT;      or REPORT AUDIT LAST 15; 2.90.5.5.5.3.  ACT;                                              execute IRU commands 2.90.5.5.5.4.  @EOF                                            exit IRU AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 110 2.90.5.6.  Printer Device.  Self-explanatory.  This should be your dummy queue of where to SYM the output reports. 2.91.  Initiation of STR.  STR is initiated by the following key-in:             @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU60 When STR begins, the following message will be displayed: ================================== ====       NGVU60  STR REV: 01      ==== ================================== STR Prompts.  STR will now prompt for the processing parameters.  The following display will ask for the ADS-ID: ENTER 3 POSITION   The operator must enter a valid ADS-ID.  If in error, the prompt will be displayed again.  Once a valid ADS-ID has been accepted, the operator is asked to enter the audit trail tape number that the recovery is to begin with.  The following message will be displayed: ENTER AUDIT TRAIL TAPE REEL NUMBER If the operator enters an invalid response, STR will again ask for the tape number with the above message.  Next, the operator will be asked to enter the starting date and time of the recovery period with the following message: USE LOCAL DATE/TIME.  DO NOT USE GMT DATE/TIME. – ENTER START DATE/TIME IN FOLLOWING FORMAT MM/DD/YYYY  HR:MN  After accepting the valid start date and time, STR will ask for the ending start date and time of the recovery period with the following message: ENTER STOP DATE/TIME IN FOLLOWING FORMAT MM/DD/YYYY  HR:MN If either starting or ending dates or times are invalid, an error message will be displayed and the operator must, again, keyin a valid date and/or time.  After all above messages have properly been answered, the following message will be displayed for output queue: ENTER PRINTER DEVICE-ID Enter output queue for listings and the following message will be displayed: --------------------------------------- GANG/ADS...........XGV ALN..............…….XXXX REEL-NUMBER....XXXXXX PRINTER......….....DEPXXX START-DATE (LOCAL).MM/DD/YYYY  HR:MN AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 111 START-DATE (GMT)...MM/DD/YYYY  HR:MN END-DATE (LOCAL)...MM/DD/YYYY  HR:MN END-DATE (GMT).....MM/DD/YYYY  HR:MN --------------------------------------- IS THE ABOVE INFORMATION CORRECT? (Y/N) Enter "N" to correct the processing parameters, enter "Y" to accept the input and the following message will be displayed: YOU MUST DETERMINE THE TYPE OF TAPE YOU USE. YOUR OPTIONS ARE: OPT MEANING --------------------------------------- 1 - SQUARE TAPE, (JOHNNY-5)      "HICL" 2 - SQUARE TAPE, RPC (WITH A SILO) "U9" (U9V,U9S) 3 - ROUND TAPE, SBLC (NO SILO)     "U9" (U9V,U9S) 4 - ROUND TAPE, 9 TRACK            "NT" (NTV,NTS) WHAT IS YOUR OPTION"  (1/2/3/4) Contact your DMC about what type of tape you are using.  Once you determine and input the type of tape you are using, the below message will display: AUDIT TRAIL ASSIGN (ASG) WILL BE:  "@ASG,T SYS$*AUDIT$01.,U9V,XXXXXX,1800 .    "   (XXXXXX = tape number) IS THE ABOVE ASG CORRECT? (Y/N) Enter "Y" to start your recovery, and "N" to exit the program. 2.92.  Processing NGVU60.  STR (NGVU60) will read all applicable audit trail tapes and extract all messages for input ADS, reel number, start and ending times.  These messages are then read against SCRNF177 for applicable format.  By using the current screen file, STR edits the image, which is written to audit trail in screen format and then built into an 80-position image for reinput.  These images are produced in the same sequence in which they were originally created. 2.92.1.  Once all messages, both pseudo and TIP messages have been extracted from tape, the following will be displayed on the console: 2.92.1.1.  THE DELETE FILE IS xGV0*DEL-FILE. 2.92.1.2.  AFTER COMPLETION OF THE RECOVERY, THE 2.92.1.3.  FOLLOWING START COMMAND SHOULD BE 2.92.1.4.  ENTERED FROM THE CONSOLE 2.92.1.5.  @ADD,L xGV0*DEL-FILE. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 112 2.92.1.6.  THIS WILL DELETE ALL THE WORK FILES 2.92.1.7.  CREATED BY NGVU60 2.92.2.  The deletion file is used to delete all files created by STR.  This job should be started only  after  the  complete  STR  processed  is  finished  and  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology  Activity  resumes  normal  SBSS  processing.    That  is,  the  database  has  been recovered and verified in a stable state.  The following notes will apply when the edit is being performed: 2.92.2.1.  STR  will  not  build  your  input  images  for  twilight  processing.    The  listing  of transaction histories (901-records) will reflect these, but there will not be images in your XGV0*TXFILE.  These inputs are all read by batch programs (i.e., FME/NGV580).  These inputs will require being re-created and reprocessed manually. 2.92.2.2.  Any database alterations (NGV299) processing will have to be accomplished as FIX input images are not written to audit trail tape.  Database AFTERLOOKS are not used by NGV299. 2.92.2.3.  Ensure  that  the  Supply  Interface  System  (SIFS)  collector  and  all  related  SIFS processing is suspended until completion of the applicable STR recovery period.  Also be sure that an ICIRDYDOWN has been processed to preclude any interruptions by any other ADS  activity.    If  STR  cannot  identify  the  next  tape  number  to  be  used,  the  following message will be displayed: 2.92.2.3.1.  STR HAS REACHED THE END OF THE TAPE XXXXXX. 2.92.2.3.2.  THE NEXT REEL NUMBER ON THAT TAPE CONTAINS 2.92.2.3.3.  @@@@@@ THEREFORE, THE NEXT REEL NUMBER CANNOT 2.92.2.3.4.  BE IDENTIFIED.  DO YOU WANT ANOTHER TAPE MOUNTED (Y OR N)? 2.92.2.4.  This usually indicates the DMC operator manually closed out the audit trail tape when  it  was  active.    Obtain  the  next  reel  number  to  be  used  from  the  DMC  operator.  Answer Y for STR to continue.  It will then prompt you to enter the next reel number. 2.92.2.5.  If the next reel number is not readily available, answer N.  The STR will process data from the tapes already read in this session.  Once the next reel is known and available, just  start  another  run  of  STR  using  this  reel  number  as  the  beginning  tape  number.  Remember, if you do this before processing the inputs created by the first STR run, catalog and copy off all of your STR files to keep from corrupting or losing them.  If multiple reels are used with STR, verify audit trail listing displays open and swaps for a continuous run.  If an audit trail tape is closed NGVU60 will stop.  If you have multiple reels with STR, recommend  only  using  two  tapes  for  each  STR.    (For  example,  if  you  had  six  tapes  to process, then you would start the STR recovery against the first two tapes.  After all TX-FILES have been created, recommend processing files individually and taking IRU dump and processing NDA500 between runs.  You would repeat these  steps until all six tapes have been recovered.)  This gives an updated point to return if problems are encountered with the following tapes. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 113 2.93.  Editing With  NGV291.  NGV291  was  developed  to  edit  only  the  xGV0*TXFILE.    It  is menu-driven which will list all available options.  The following key-in  will activate NGV291.  NGV291 interfaces with demand screen number 637.                                                            @ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.NGV291/Gx    . x = gang (1 through 4 only). 2.93.1.  To print the file, option Y will SYM it to the desired printer.  Each input image on the listing  will  contain  a  record  number.    This  record  number  is  the  key  for  reviewing  the xGV0*TXFILE.  Once all modifications have been made to the file, it can be input through the pseudo reader.  The following are the options used to manipulate the file and what each option will do: Table 2.4.  Options used to manipulate xGV0*TXFILE. OPTIONS DESCRIPTION  1.  REVIEW  2.  MODIFY  3.  NEXT (R) - this option will bring the first input up on the screen. (M) - this option will allow any portion of input to be modified. (N) - this option will bring the next input up on the screen.  4.  PREVIOUS (P) - this option will bring the previous input back upon the screen.  5.  CHANGE  6.  DELETE  7.  UNDELETE  8.  SAVE  9.  QUIT 10.  HELP 11.  SYM (C) - this option will allow changes to be made to the current input. (D) - this option will delete the current image.  In place of the input image will be a MSG to 057 showing that the input was deleted. (U) - this option will restore an image which may have been inadvertently deleted.  Your listing from the SYM will show you the exact image number to restore. (S) -  this option will save all changes and will exit NGV291.  To reenter NGV291, the above @ADD statement will have to be reentered. (Q) -  this option will exit NGV291 without saving any changes. (H) -  this option will display all authorized commands. (Y) - this option will SYM the listing to the specified device.  Once the Y option is transmitted, you will be asked to enter the queue number of where the listing is to be printed. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 114 2.93.2.  The  TRIC  select  option  can  be  used  with  the  majority  of  the  above  commands  in searching for a specific input.  Once an output listing has been printed, SBSS personnel will do a manual review of the input images BEFORE the transactions are processed through the pseudo.    This  manual  review  should  include  the  recommended  actions  in  the  next  six paragraphs. 2.93.2.1.  TRIC  SHP.    The  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  personnel, along  with  Stock  Control  personnel,  should  review  the  input  file  (xGV0*TXFILE.)  for TRIC SHP.  This review should be for shipments of unserviceable assets.  These inputs should  be  held  until  all  other  processing  is  complete.    Then  using  QLP,  select  the unserviceable  details  for  these  stock  numbers  and  system  designators.    Enter  the  new unserviceable detail document number in the SHP transaction and reprocess.  There is no external  input  to  ensure  the  unserviceable  is  reestablished  under  the  same  number  as previously used. 2.93.2.2.  TRIC AEx.  Delete all AEx inputs, x equals any value that contains a cancellation status code.  Since the AEx has already processed prior to the STR recovery, the request for cancellation has already been sent. 2.93.2.3.  TRIC ISU and SPR.  Review processing by LRS / materiel management activity and Accounting and Finance personnel, should be done to ensure the ISU/SPR and other transactions are in the correct sequence within the input TXFILE. 2.93.2.4.  TRIC MSI and SPR for MSI.  These inputs should be deleted from the input file.  If, for instance, it was an automatic ISU (0 balance), the MSI would process twice.  Since the MSI is in the input file, it would process the ISU; that ISU would produce the MSI and the MSI in the file TXFILE would process again.  Therefore, deleting these images will eliminate  double  processing.    Advise  the  applicable  personnel  in  LRS  /  materiel management activity that these images were deleted so they can reestablish the appropriate records. 2.93.2.5.  TRIC FRC.  If you have a SPR in the transaction file for the same stock number that is in the FRC image, delete the FRC.  When the SPR reprocesses it will reestablish the due-in detail under the correct requisition number. 2.93.2.6.  Any other review that needs to be accomplished should be completed prior to any reprocessing of the transactions.  Once the review is completed, you are ready to replay your STR transactions. 2.94.  Pseudo  Processing.  Bases  should  process  NGV299  to  alter  the  002-REQUISITION-SERIAL-NBR  field  on  the  002-record  to  the  next  even  thousand  to  ensure  duplicates  are  not assigned  (that  is,  if  the  last  requisition  serial  number  was  1567,  then  002-REQUISITION-SERIAL-NBR should be altered to 2000).  By doing this, if an input is missed, you will not have any  duplicate  transactions  when  finished.    Close  coordination  of  all  output  documents  must  be accomplished.    Inputs  should  be  broken  down  to  manageable  batches.    The  number  of  inputs processed in each batch will be determined by the types of inputs and what the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity personnel feel comfortable with.  The SBSS should be up, with releveling, follow-up, and file status suppressed and all terminals off until this STR processing has been completed. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 115 2.95.  Post  Processing.  When  the  last  inputs  are  processed,  the  following  steps  will  be accomplished: 2.95.1.  Run the END image. 2.95.2.  Take and IRU dump of primary gang. 2.95.3.  Process NDA500, ALL sets excluding CTH. 2.95.4.  Recommend processing any backlog of Base Level ADRSS II System (BLAMES). 2.95.5.  Process all mandatory EOD reports for recovered transactions. 2.95.6.  Suspend all outbound (SIFS) until it has been determined that no requisitions from this STR  process  are  transmitted.    It  is  strongly  recommended  that  one  person  from  Document Control oversee all 1348-1A documents to be identified with the original output. 2.95.7.  Once all reports have been processed and the STR process completed, delete ALL files from this STR session. 2.95.8.  Transaction Counts.  You will, in most cases, never recover a one for one transaction count.  This is due to audit trail tape block errors or noise block errors.  The main concern is to recover the SBSS database to the most efficient and stable condition as possible.  The AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  supervisor  and/or  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity personnel should be aware of an excessive amount of read errors from audit trail tapes on a day-to-day basis.  If excessive amounts of these errors persist, contact your DMC system monitor to try and eliminate these errors.  Remember, safety dumps and correcting system errors when they occur prevents the use of STR. Section 2N—-LRS / Materiel Management Activity And Financial System Constants 2.96.  Overview.  This section provides the procedures for use of constants data elements.  The Accounting and Finance and disbursing serial number (ADSN), MAJCOM code, terminal function assignments, etc., are specific system configurations and operational system data elements which vary from base to base.  These constant data elements are assigned at base level and loaded to the SBSS database.  In this section, the x is used to indicate the applicable primary gang number. 2.97.  Base  Constants.  Base  constants  provide  base  level  functions  with  the  capability  to  load unique  data  which  identify  processes  and  computer  terminals  used  at  those  bases.    The  SBSS application programs reference this data during processing to validate inputs, determine processing rationale, and define output traffic flow.  Base system configuration and data constants are loaded to  the  001-BASE-CONSTANTS-1  record,  002  SPECIAL-CONTROL  record,  106-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR record and 310 A&F-VARIABLE-DATA record.  Terminal data is loaded to the 014-BASE-CONSTANTS-2  record,  021  PID-HEADER  record.    Care  must  be  taken  to  ensure these  constants  are  current  at  all  times.    Computer  Operations  is  responsible  for  developing, maintaining, and processing these inputs.  Programs NGV068A, NGV068B, and NGV068C are provided for this purpose. 2.98.  Terminal Translate Tables.  A standard method of identifying input and addressing output to terminals is necessary because the number and application of terminals will vary at different bases.    Use  of  terminal  translate  tables  allows  each  system  designator  to  specify  the  preferred AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 116 terminal to receive output designated for a given terminal (see Para 2.177) and adjust this to suit actual local conditions. 2.98.1.  Program  NGV068A.    Program  NGV068A  provides  a  menu-driven  process  for maintaining terminal translate data.  It provides edits to ensure the terminal data are correct and  verifies  that  the  minimum  mandatory  terminals  are  included  in  the  terminal  file.    The mandatory terminals are listed in  Para 2.177.  Although these are the mandatory terminals, they should not be the only terminals included.  There should be a terminal image for each function number that could receive unsolicited output.  This will include function numbers for all assigned warehouses, Stock Control, Record Maintenance, etc. 2.98.2.  Program  NGV211A.    Program  NGV211A  is  the  SBSS  Executive  program  which delivers the output document to a terminal.  It attempts to deliver output to the function number and  system  designator  supplied  by  the  application  program.    When  it  does  not  locate  that function  in  the  translate  tables,  it  defaults  to  function  number  444  for  the  supplied  system designator.    When  NGV211A  cannot  deliver  the  output  to  444  for  the  supplied  system designator, it defaults to 444 for system designator 01.  In each instance, when a function is not located in the terminal translate tables, NGV211A creates a 703 Management Notice which is  written  to  the  Cumulative  Reject  Suspense  area.    The  only  means  available  to  clear  this notice is with program NGV818.  To prevent 703 management notices, load the appropriate function number as a pseudo device (type equipment = 99) and direct its output to a terminal with a printer.  When a terminal's output is designated for a print queue, program NGV211A will  call  NGV214 file 0GV0<ALN>00XX*GV214-yyyy. (xx = output system designator, yyyy = TIP number of the first document in the file) and stores documents in that file until one of the following three conditions occurs:   Program  NGV214  creates for  processing. the  print 2.98.2.1.  The system designator of the output document changes. 2.98.2.2.  Program NGV214 times out because of no output. 2.98.2.3.  The file is full (100 documents).  Once the file is closed, NGV211A sends the file to the queue listed in the site-ID field of terminal 445 for the output system designator.  When no 445 terminal is located, the default is 445 for system designator 01.  When there is no 445 system designator 01, the default is function 020 for system designator 01. 2.98.3.  Program  NGV211B.    NGV211B  is  the  SBSS  Executive  program  which  delivers listings,  labels,  and  produces  output  images  to  a  queue.    When  a  print  file  is  created,  the application  program  passes  NGV211B  the  system  designator  of  the  print  file.    NGV211B locates  terminal  020  for  the  application  program  supplied  system  designator.    When  it  is located, NGV211B sends the file to the queue listed in the queue field.  If NGV211B does not locate 020 in the translate tables, it defaults to terminal 020 for system designator 01.  When the print file is for bar coded labels, NGV211B locates terminal 496 for the supplied system designator and sends the file to the run-ID listed in the run-ID field.   If terminal 496 is not located, NGV211B defaults to 020 for the supplied system designator.  If 020 is not located, NGV211B defaults to terminal 020 for system designator 01.  When an image file is created, the  application  program  passes  NGV211B,  the  system  designator  of  the  output  queue/file.  NGV211B locates terminal 442 for the supplied system designator and sends the file to the queue listed in the queue field.  If terminal 442 is not located, NGV211B defaults to 020 for AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 117 the supplied system designator.  If 020 is not located, NGV211B defaults to terminal 020 for system designator 01. 2.99.  Loading of System Constant.  There are three methods available for loading constant and terminal data.  Except for the initial load, constant and terminal information should not require mass changes or reload.  A TIP process is available for updating the SBSS database when minor changes  are needed.  This  capability is  available using options 7 and 8 in program  NGV068A.  NGV068A passes images to the tip program NGV269 for updating in online mode only.  Program NGV068B loads terminal data using images located in filename xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. and  constants  and  support  data  from  images  in  file  xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD701.    These  are multi-sequential  access  method  (MSAM)  files  updated  by  program  NGV068A  and  cannot  be accessed by another processor.  To process NGV068B, execute the following: 2.99.1.  @0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV068B,XXXX 2.99.2.  This processor call is followed by an option field, XXXX, which is separated from the call processor by a comma.  The options in the option field can be specified in any order with spaces between them.  The available options are: 2.99.2.1.  P - Indicates primary database. 2.99.2.2.  C - Indicates constant data load.  Creates a listing of database and input data. 2.99.2.3.  T - Indicates terminal data. 2.99.2.4.  Z - Indicates the listing created is verification only (no updates).  This option can only be used in conjunction with option C.           Note:     The option field consists of a minimum of two and a maximum of four options. 2.100.  Special  Instructions.  Program  NGV068B  must  be  run  in  demand  mode.    Prior  to processing NGV068B, ensure that your gang number is reflected in the first position of your sign-on project-ID and current qualifier.  You can check these fields by executing a @WHOAMI in demand  mode.    Program  NGV068C  can  be  processed  anytime  the  Multi-Sequential  Access Method  (MSAM)  terminal  data  file  (xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700.)  is  corrupted.    Program NGV068C reads the Base Constants-2 Records (014) which use this data to re-create the corrupted MSAM terminal data file.  This program will not rebuild the Constants/Support Data file, only the Terminal Data file.  If not cataloged, NGV068C will catalog file xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. and rebuild the terminal data by processing: 2.100.1.  @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV068C 2.101.  Other Constants Data.  In addition to the most commonly used base system configuration constants, all AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisors and operators must be aware of the record constants loaded on the following: Table 2.5.

Two-Page  Concept.  The  two-page  concept  is  beneficial  in  high  volume  input  areas (Receiving)  and  where  large  volumes  of  unsolicited  output  is  printed  (Stock  Control).    This concept allows the operator to input on one page and receive the output on the second page without being continuously interrupted with output documents.  One disadvantage is that inquiries input on the input page will automatically be printed on the output page.  In a single-page concept (input and  output  on  the  same  page),  the  inquiry  will  display  on  the  screen  without  printing.    The procedures  for  the  two-page  concept  are  as  follows:    configure  one  page  as  a  normal  SBSS function; for example 062, configure the second page as another valid function; for example, 077 and place 077 in the output function number field of the terminal image for 062. 2.103.  Constant Demand Processor (CDP) (NGV068A).  The CDP program does not access the SBSS  database;  however,  it  provides  a  means  to  create,  change,  or  delete  CON  images  for processing  by  programs  NGV068B  or  NGV269.    The  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity operator enters @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV068A to initiate the CDP.  The Master Menu (Screen 600), Para 2.168 displays.  It provides nine options as follows: 2.103.1.  Option 1, End Processing.  This option (Para 2.169) exits to Demand mode.  Prior to exiting,  a  verification  process  is  accomplished  except  when  option  7  has  processed  and  no terminal images have been updated since that option. 2.103.2.  Option 2, List Terminal Data.  This option (Para 2.170) creates a listing of terminal images.  Seven sequences are available (see Para 2.170, Screen 598). 2.103.3.  Option 3, Inquire Terminal Data.  This option (Para 2.171) allows the user to create, change, delete, or inquire terminal images. 2.103.4.  Option 4, List Constant/Support Data.  This option (Para 2.172) produces a listing of constants and support data images in system designator sequence. 2.103.5.  Option 5, Inquire Host Constant Data.  This option (Para 2.173) allows the user to create, change, or inquire constant images for system designator 01 only. 2.103.6.  Option 6, Inquire Support Data.  This option (Para 2.174) allows the user to create, change, delete, or inquire support images for each system designator. 2.103.7.  Option 7, Update SBSS With Terminal Data.  This option (Para 2.175) allows the user to  pass  CON images from  the xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD700. terminal  file to  TIP for update of the SBSS primary gang database.  The SBSS primary gang must be in the online mode  or  the  images  will  remain  on  node  11  until  the  SBSS  is  online.    In  addition,  the  014 AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 119 terminal record for function number 000 must be loaded for the images to be accepted by the SBSS. 2.103.8.  Option 8, Update SBSS With Constant Data.  This option (Para 2.176) allows the user to pass constant and support images from the xGV0<ALN>*GV068AUD701. constant file to TIP for update of the SBSS primary gang database.  The SBSS primary gang must be in the online mode or the images will not be updated to the database.  In addition, the 014 terminal record for function number 000 must be loaded for the images to be accepted by the SBSS. 2.103.9.  Option 9, Verify Terminal Data With Adds and Changes.  This option (Para 2.177) allows the user to verify the terminal data file only if one or more terminals are flagged with an add or change.  This option will verify and then terminate NGV068A processor. Section 2O—-Selective Utility Programs 2.104.  Overview.  Utility programs can be called from the program bank only during twilight and reports mode.  If operating online, the END image must be processed to ensure an orderly close-out of all terminals. 2.104.1.  Individual  programs  may contain  parameter information  in  the utility select  image and/or have additional parameter images.  If additional images are required, place them behind the utility select image, followed by a STOP image, if required. 2.104.2.  This section describes selective utility programs.  Not all SBSS utility programs are documented within this section. 2.104.3.  STOP Image.  Many of the utility programs use a STOP image to signal the program when all parameter or data images have been read.  This image must have STOP in positions 1-4. 2.105.  Inventory Valuation Utility (UTL020). 2.105.1.  Program  UTL020  computes  the  inventory  balance  and  stores  the  results  in  022-FILLER-1.  If the computed balance is different from what the current record indicates, move the  computed  Inventory  Balance  to  022-FILLER-1.    The  program  should  also  output  a discrepancy  list  in  column  format.    The  program  will  display  ‘NO  DISCREPANCIES DETECTED’ if there are no discrepancies. 2.105.2.  Frequency.

Give all output to Records Maintenance to research discrepancy. 2.106.  Item and Repair Cycle Record Linkage Check (NGV024). 2.106.1.  Program NGV024 provides the capability to verify that a repair cycle record exists for each ERRCD XD and XF type item record, that no repair cycle record exists for an ERRCD other than XD or XF type item record, and that all repair cycle records have an owner record that is  an ERRCD XD or XF type item  record.  Program  NGV024 produces a listing of all errors that is an ERRCD XD or XF type item record.  Program NGV024 produces a listing of all errors detected by type, and reflects the database record elements of the records found to be in error.  Record count totals are printed by record type.  An item record count will be printed when positions 9-11 of the parameter image are blank or contain ITM.  A repair cycle record count will be printed when positions 9-11 of the parameter image are blank or contain RCR. 2.106.2.  The type of database record scan to be performed is based upon the option selected in positions 9-11 of the parameter image.  If positions 9-11 contain ITM, the ITMDTL-AREA of the SBSS database is  scanned for item records.  When an item record is found, program NGV024 determines whether or not a repair cycle record should exist based upon the ERRCD.  If the item record ERRCD equals XD or XF, the program reads the ITEM-R-C set for which the item record is the owner to determine the existence of a repair cycle record.  If the set is empty, an S528 MGT ITEM RECORD WITH REPAIR CYCLE ERRCD, BUT NO REPAIR CYCLE RECORD EXISTS - NOTICE ONLY is produced with the item record data content.  If it is determined that the item record should not have a related repair cycle record, the ITEM-R-C set is checked for an existing repair cycle record.  If a repair cycle record is located for that  item  record,  an  S538  MGT  ITEM  RECORD  WITH  NON-  REPAIR  CYCLE  ERRCD, BUT REPAIR CYCLE RECORD EXISTS - NOTICE ONLY and the repair cycle record data will be produced. 2.106.3.  If positions 9-11 contain RCR, the REPCYC-AREA of the SBSS database is scanned for repair cycle records.  When a repair cycle record is found, program NGV024 determines the existence of an owner item record by the ITEM-R-C Set.  If an owner item record does exist, the item record is checked for an ERRCD equal to XD or XF.  If the owner item record ERRCD is unequal to XD or XF, an S539 MGT REPAIR CYCLE RECORD WITH ITEM RECORD CONTAINING NON-REPAIR CYCLE ERRCD - NOTICE ONLY message and the applicable repair cycle and item records will be output.  If an owner item record does not exist,  an  S529  MGT  REPAIR  CYCLE  RECORD  WITH  NO  ITEM  RECORD  -  NOTICE ONLY message and the applicable repair cycle record will be output. 2.106.4.  If positions 9-11 are blank, both the ITMDTL-AREA and REPCYC-AREA of the SBSS database will be scanned and the functions will be performed. 2.106.5.  Frequency.  As required, but at least once each month. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 121 2.106.6.  Format. 2.106.6.1.  Select Image Input Format. Table 2.7.  Select Image Input Format.

This program should be processed anytime an item or repair cycle record relationship error is suspected.  This condition can normally be identified by  reviewing  the  daily  Fail  Safe  (NGV027)  Listing.    Anytime  the  number  of  repair  cycle records does not match the number of DIFM item records, an error exists and utility program NGV024  should  be  processed  to  identify  the  specific  records  in  error.    Additionally,  the program should be processed monthly to identify errors not readily found by reviewing Fail Safe Listings; that is, where record counts match and records are not correctly linked.  Restart is from beginning. 2.107.  Failsafe (NGV027).  The FailSafe Program, NGV027, provides the counts of basic records and detail records by system designator.  Selective edits are performed on basic and detail records by system designator.  If an error condition is encountered, the record key, contents, and error type phrase are printed along with the counts.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 5 for specific record formats. 2.107.1.  Program Logic for NGV027 computes totals for item, repair cycle, and detail records, by system designator. 2.107.1.1.  Errors. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 122 2.107.1.1.1.

When a discrepancy is noted in record counts, the discrepancy must be investigated to determine what action caused the error.  All potential areas for error are too numerous to list.  Some typical checks that should be made are: 2.107.4.1.  Investigate fully any known tape error that occurred during reject and restore to determine validity of the restore.  Also included would be system crashes, power outs or fluxes. 2.107.4.2.  Database key or set error rejects printed out on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console may indicate record fields erroneously written to the DBRA by program error, or generated through tape or hardware failure. 2.107.4.3.  Check  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  console  printouts  in Document Control for any record alterations with program NGV299. 2.107.4.4.  If  the  reloading  of  an  IRU  dump  and  subsequent  running  of  the  program produces totals which do not  agree with  the program  totals  originally dumped, then the reloading process should be checked for tape errors. 2.107.4.5.  Management Uses.  NGV027 provides the ADPE Unit with a total of basic and detail records currently loaded on the DBRA.  The list is used to verify record counts during recoveries, DBRA uploads, and IRU dumps.  Identifies record errors that require Computer Operations corrective action before additional processing can continue. 2.108.  Satellite  Rehoming  Download  (NGV028).  Program  NGV028  copies  to  tape  selected item records, detail records, in-use detail records, repair cycle records, and support records to tape, for load/reload with program NGV030, Satellite Rehoming Upload. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 123 2.108.1.  Records are selected by system designator(s).  This program will create an original and safety backup download dump.        CAUTION:  This is a general purpose and multi-application program.  In most cases, use of its many options will require preconversion and/or post-conversion actions on the part of the losing and gaining bases.  This program must be run as directed by the user's MAJCOM, and only run as a part of a plan which addresses the specific database conversion or application to be accomplished.  Additionally, the rehoming process affects non-SBSS systems.  Coordinate with the losing/gaining accounting and finance offices’ standard materiel accounting system (SMAS) monitor to ensure an integrated transition. 2.108.2.  Program  Logic.    The  ITMDTL-AREA  of  the  SBSS  database  is  scanned  for  item records.    Item  records  are  checked  for  system  designator(s)  equal  to  the  system  designator constants(s) in the parameter images. 2.108.2.1.  If  an  equal  condition  exists,  the  item  record  and  all  of  its  subordinate  detail records, repair cycle records, and in-use detail records are written to tape. 2.108.2.2.  After  the  scan  for  item  records  has  been  completed,  the  system  designator record(s) are read for each system designator in the parameter input(s) and the subordinate fuels records that reside in the FUELS-AREA, inventory accuracy records, ARMS records, and routing identifier records, are written to tape if directed by the option for each record type if the program select image so designates. 2.108.2.3.  Modifications  to  the  item  records  and  detail  records  are  made  based  on parameter input(s) options prior to writing the records to tape. 2.108.2.4.  Program  NGV028  will  create  an  initial  download  tape,  then  automatically create a safety tape.  If more than one tape is required for the download of the account, the first tape will be reel #1 of the download, and the second tape will be reel #1 for the safety tape.  Then the third tape will be reel #2 of the initial download dump, and the fourth tape will be reel #2 of the safety tapes.  Therefore, reels 1 and 3 would be used for the upload rehome, and reels 2 and 4 would be kept for the backup Safety Download reels. 2.108.3.  Format for NGV028.

A message is passed to the DMC operator to mount the required tape to be used by program NGV030.  For restart, if this is a satellite-to-satellite rehome, reload database dump prior to starting NGV030.  If this is a satellite to new host or bare base load, initialize database and replay new host base procedures starting with program NGV068B.  If aborted for any reason, the database must be restored to the point prior to running NGV030 and program NGV030 must be restarted. 2.110.8.  Special Instructions for NGV030.  Program NGV030 must be run on the primary database after RPTEON on the secondary and prior to BOD on the primary.  When processing NGV030 and the 001-XADS-AFEMS-FLAG is set to yes, the program will create XSC images to be captured by SIFS to be routed the C001 Computer System.  See AFMAN 23-122, Sec 1C, Satellite Operations for Gaining Base rehome instructions for NGV030. 2.111.  Change  Stock  Record  Account  Number  (SRAN)  (NGV031).  This  program  changes SBSS database records for a SRAN and/or MAJCOM code by system designator (SD 01 only) when requested in the program select image and directed by MAJCOM or higher authority.  When a satellite or tenant system designator is specified, only the MAJCOM code can be changed. 2.111.1.  Program  Logic.    The  program  select  image  is  read  and  edited.    A  scan  of  the ITMDTL-AREA, REPCYC-AREA, PRTNBR-AREA, ATHINU-AREA, and ISG-AREA of the  SBSS  database  is  made  on  all  detail,  item,  repair  cycle,  part  number  item  relationship, authorized/in-use detail, and interchangeable and substitute records.  The last four positions of each record account number are requested.  Each time an equal condition is encountered, the new  SRAN  (obtained  from  positions  40-43  of  the  program  select  images)  is  written  to  the applicable record and the SBSS database is updated.        Note:     If the change to the MAJCOM code option is requested, then the system designators of the due-in from maintenance (DIFM) detail, special level detail, or the War Reserve Materiel (WRM) War Consumable Distribution Objective  (WCDO)  spare  detail  record  are  equal  to  the  input  program  select  image  system designator.  The detail record MAJCOM code is compared to the applicable command code in the report select card.  If equal, it is bypassed.  If the MAJCOM codes are unequal, the detail is updated with the MAJCOM code from the input select image.  If at least one detail record MAJCOM code is changed or the MAJCOM code change was not requested, the program will continue through the remaining database records to change SRAN, if requested. 2.111.2.

This option will only be used when changing SRAN. 2.  This option will only be used when changing MAJCOM code.  Ensure that the MAJCOM code is correct, since the program does not perform an edit for a valid MAJCOM code.  When this option is used, it is mandatory to enter the new MAJCOM code in positions 44-45 and system designator in positions 48-49.  Only the MAJCOM code for that system designator will be changed.  DIFM detail records will be updated with this option only. 3.  This option will include special level detail records in the MAJCOM code update when a dash (-) is entered. 4.  This option will include WRM WCDO spares detail records in the MAJCOM code update when a dash (-) is entered. 5.  This is a mandatory entry when requesting a MAJCOM code change.  The MAJCOM code that is changed will only be for the system designator entered in positions 48-49 and the MAJCOM code entered in positions 44-45 of the program select image.  For restart, start from beginning unless the file has been destroyed.  It will not be necessary to reload the file dump.  Although records previously changed will be rechecked, they will be unequal to the old AFSRAN so no change will be made. 2.111.3.  Special Instructions for NGV031.  On the day prior to the date the AFSRAN change is to be effective, process all necessary reports.  Program NGV031 should be run during end-of-month and must be run on the primary database. 2.111.3.1.  When the MAJCOM code option is to be used, ensure that organization cost center  record changes (FOR) transactions have been successfully processed for affected organization codes prior to running program NGV031.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8, for organization cost center record change input processing. 2.111.3.2.  Ensure  that  program  NGV836/M10,  Consolidated  Inventory  Adjustment Register, is run to clear any adjustment records on the SBSS database for the old SRAN prior to running program NGV031.  This requires that all inventories (Complete, Special, Sample) and warehouse validations are complete.  Run a R22 Conversion Audit List. 2.111.3.3.  After  all  reports  have  been  processed  and  prior  to  RPTEON:    Ensure  that RPTEON has processed on the secondary. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 131 2.111.3.3.1.  Take a normal database SAVE and have the DMC console operator label the reel(s) PRIOR TO A SRAN CHANGE. 2.111.3.3.2.  Execute program NGV031. 2.111.3.3.3.  Load the base constants with the new SRAN.  See section 2C, this chapter for base-constants processing procedures. 2.111.3.3.4.  Process  an  IRUDUMP  and  have  the  DMC  console  operator  label  the reel(s) AFTER AFSRAN CHANGE. 2.111.3.3.5.  Run a R22 Conversion Audit List. 2.111.3.3.6.  Reinitialize offline and process report select image RPTEON. 2.111.3.3.7.  Initialize beginning-of-day and resume normal operation. 2.111.4.  If  the  option  to  change  the  SRAN  is  executed,  consideration  should  be  given  to executing Data Reorganization Utility (DRU) so the file can be reorganized. 2.112.  Download  Bypass  Record  Area  (NGV032).  This  program  downloads  selected  SBSS database  records  at  the  end  of  each  secondary  database  reports  processing  cycle.    Program NGV032 scans the secondary database records, selects records affected by reports processing, and stores  selected  records  for  NGV033.            Note:        FOR  NGV032  AND  NGV033:    Since  both programs are processed within NGV898C, manual intervention of either of these programs are not authorized. 2.112.1.  Special Instructions for NGV032.  Program NGV033 is called by program NGV898C as a result  of the RPTEON selection image input  against the secondary database.  Program NGV033 will execute upon successful completion of program NGV032.  Database records are retrieved  by  program  NGV032  on  the  secondary  database  and  modified  on  the  primary database by program NGV033.

NGV225  is used to create CT-HISTORY-CONTROL and CT-SUPPORT records whenever the Consolidated Transaction  History  (CTH)  database  is  established.    Each  primary  gang  supporting  the  system requires  a  CT-HISTORY-CONTROL  and  CT-SUPPORT  record.    This  program  will  catalog, register, reserve, and initialize with DMU.  Depending on how large your CTH database areas are sized will depend on how long this process takes. 2.127.1.  The  program  is  executed  from  a  demand  terminal  using  the  following  statement:               @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R 2.127.1.1.  The  program  prompts  for  a  gang  number  equal  to  1-4.    A  message  displays when an invalid gang number is entered, and the system will again prompt the user for a valid gang number. 2.127.1.2.  The program prompts for the number of database pages reserved in the SBSS schema  for  the  CT-HISTORY  records,  once  a  valid  gang  number  is  entered.    Enter  six AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 153 numeric characters (other than zeros) equaling the number of pages reserved for the CT-HISTORY  records.    Left  justify  the  numeric  entry  with  zeroes  (for  example:    20,000 entered as 020000).  After an invalid entry, a message prompts for the number of pages. 2.127.1.3.  The user enters all the correct data and the program establishes the CONTROL-HISTORY-CONTROL and CT-SUPPORT records.  If the CTH system is required on more than one gang you must process NGV225R for each gang. 2.127.2.  Special Instructions for NGV225R.  This program must be processed on the primary CTH database. 2.127.2.1.  If the size of the area for the CTH System changes, do the following: 2.127.2.1.1.  Download  the  consolidated  transaction  history  records  for  each  gang using  program  NGV041,  Consolidated  Transaction  History  Download.    (See  this chapter for the CTH Download program.) 2.127.2.1.2.  Resize  the  CTH  database.    (See  Ch  3  for  SBSS  Sizing  Procedures.)  Ensure  you  follow  all  procedures  such  as  IRU  dumps,  EXEC  dumps,  etc.,  before continuing with these steps. 2.127.2.1.3.  Process program NGV225 to reestablish the gang numbers supported and to reserve database pages with new sizing figures. 2.127.2.1.4.  Reload  the  CTH  records  for  each  gang  using  program  NGV043, Consolidated  Transaction  History  Record  Load.    The  records  must  be  reloaded  in sequence with the oldest date loaded first.  (See this chapter for the CTH Record Load program.)  Restart from beginning. 2.128.  Depot  Maintenance  and  Accounting  Production  System  (DMAPS)  Initialization Utility (NGV302). 2.128.1.  Program NGV302 applies only to AFMC Air Logistics Complex bases (Hill, Tinker, and  Robins)  and  satellite  system  designator  A1  from  Kadena.    These  bases  contain organization records that are considered DMAPS organization codes.  They are identified by the fund code (6L, 6M, or 6Z).  Program NGV302 will scan 205 records for due-outs with a fund  code  as  stated  above  and  will  create  a  file  to  be  sent  through  SIFS  to  DMAPS.    The program  will  also  scan  201,  205  and  CTH  records  for  records  that  meet  the  organization criteria.    It  will  then  select  item  record  information  for  cataloging  purposes  to  be  used  by DMAPS.  This file will also be sent through SIFS to DMAPS. 2.128.2.  Frequency.  As required. 2.128.3.

Consolidated  Transaction  History  Document  Control  Process  (NGV783).  This process provides an interface between the SBLC and the personal computer (PC) for selecting and transmitting document control and Consolidated Transaction History (CTH) records.  To delete or update document control record (DCR), delete delinquent source records, and update CTH records. 2.129.1.  Program NGV783 accepts the interface parameter from the PC and does one of the following applications: 2.129.1.1.  If  the  user  asks  for  Request  DFC,  the  program  reads  the  document  control records, sorts selected records on the transaction date and serial number, the 14 positions of  the  document  number  or  the  last  8  positions  of  the  document  number,  and  transmits selected records to the PC. 2.129.1.2.  If  the  user  asks  for  Requests  Fun#/OPR,  the  program  reads  the  document control records, sorts selected records on the 14 positions of the document number, and transmits selected records to the PC. 2.129.2.  Program  NGV783  accepts  the  interface  parameter  from  the  PC  and  one  of  the following transmittal actions takes place: 2.129.2.1.  When the user transmits the DFC Work File to the standard base-level computer (SBLC),  the  program  updates  and  changes  the  document  control  records.    If  clearing  a document control record, the program deletes the document control record and delinquent source document, and updates the document control card (DCC)-CLEARED flag on the CTH record.  If updating a document control record, the program makes updates only to the document control record. 2.129.2.2.  When a user transmits the Function #/OPR Work File to the SBLC, the program updates the document control record's OPR and/or function number, as applicable. 2.129.3.  When a user transmits the DFC Work File or the Function #/OPR Work File, only the changed records update the SBLC.  This program writes all document control record (DCR) changes  to  the  DCR  Change  File  (xGV0xxxx*GV783DCC.,    #  equal  gang  number,  xxxx equals ALN if ALN is turned on; otherwise, this will be the DMC number).  The DCR Change File,  using  program  NGV288,  allows  the  recovery  of  CTH  and  document  control  record updates in the event of a system failure. 2.129.4.  Personal  Computer/SBLC  Interface  (NGVP263).    Program  NGVP263,  Personal Computer/1100  Interface,  allows  the  personal  computer  to  communicate  with  the  SBLC.  Program NGVP263 does the following: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 155 2.129.4.1.  Registers PC with the SBLC. 2.129.4.2.  Edits the return code. 2.129.4.3.  Sends data to the SBLC. 2.129.4.4.  Receives data from the SBLC. 2.129.4.5.  Deregisters PC with the SBLC. 2.129.5.  Screen Position Check (NGVP265).  Program NGVP265 determines the type of PC being  used  and  checks  the  position  of  the  cursor  on  the  screen  to  determine  if  screen transmission is required. 2.129.6.  Wait Routine (NGVP266).  Program NGVP266 determines the control transfer rate between the PC and the SBLC.  The control transfer rate is the number of seconds for each pause in the sign-on procedures. 2.129.7.  Log on to the SBLC (NGVP267).  Program NGVP267 automatically signs on a PC user to the SBLC and does the following: 2.129.7.1.  Reads the CTHECL.DAT file. 2.129.7.2.  Calls program NGVP266. 2.129.7.3.  Calls  program  NGVP263,  which  passes  CTHECL.DAT  file  images  to  the SBLC, which then generates the sign-on commands. 2.129.7.4.  Returns management/reject messages to the calling program. 2.129.8.  Log off the SBLC (NGVP269).  Program NGVP269 automatically signs a PC user off the SBLC and does the following: 2.129.8.1.  Calls program NGVP266. 2.129.8.2.  Calls program NGVP263. 2.129.8.3.  Passes @FIN and $$CLOSE commands to  program  NGVP263 which passes the commands to the SBLC. 2.129.9.  Generates management/reject notices. 2.129.10.  Special Instructions for NGV783.  This program is processed on primary system.  All error messages return to the PC and display on the operator's console.  Restart Procedures:  If  a  transmission  error  occurs,  the  message  TRANSMISSION  ERROR  displays  on  the  PC.  Reprocess  the  original  request.    If  error  reoccurs,  contact  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity for assistance. 2.129.10.1.  References.  Ch 14. 2.129.10.2.  Input.

To define the minimum steps that must be completed prior to placing a call to the SBSS Control Center.  These steps are designed to help both the base and the controller in the resolution of error conditions. 2.135.2.  Step Remarks.             1.  What is the suspected error?  _____________________________                   ____________________________________________________ Note: It is important that you try to exactly pinpoint the error.  This may require some research.  If programs are dependent upon each other, the true error condition can be hidden.  For example, program A may set a particular flag or produce some kind of output for program B.  If program A has an error and does not function properly, then program B may abort.  Under these conditions, program B may appear to be at fault when, in reality, A is in error.             2.  Are there any systems errors?                         What are they?                         ________________________________________________                         ________________________________________________ Note: Sometimes an error condition may result because the overall system may be in error.  This error may be either hardware or software related.  Hardware conditions that might produce faults are:             If there is a bad disk in use, data on that disk may be corrupted or unreachable.  For example, the system cannot read a particular sector or block of data on the disk.             Tape.  If the tape or tape drive has errors, the program may abort because it cannot read/write to the tape.             Error Mnemonics/Facility Status Codes (FAC) - Users should examine any error mnemonics or Facility Status Codes (FAC).  These will usually pinpoint the error.  Users can examine the FAC status by performing an @FAC keyin.  Error mnemonics and a description of U1100 error codes can be found in: Executive System Programmer Reference Current Version, UP 4144 (see appendix C, Diagnostic Messages and Status Codes).             3.  Did the error occur without a recent release load?  _____  What is the current release loaded?  _______________ Note: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 160 Sometimes an error condition may have just occurred.  You know it worked properly yesterday or last week.  You also know that there have been no release loads.  If this happens, chances are that something has happened at your base.  Under these conditions, users should check with their DMC to see if any local error conditions exist.             4.  Have you checked with your supervisor, DMC, or MAJCOM?  ___________________ Note: Some error condition may exist that is global, or it may have occurred earlier and your supervisor may know about the problem.  During normal duty hours, contact your MAJCOM--they may have the correction.  You should check with the DMC to ensure nothing has been changed or is in error on their side of the house.             5.  Do you know of any other bases with this same problem?  If you do, what bases?  __________ Note: Usually, if no other bases have this problem and they have the same releases loaded as you do at your base, chances are this is a local error condition.  Again, it is important that users review any actions taken or problems identified from the past couple of days.             6.  Have you read AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 3  (as it applies to this situation) to ensure proper input format?                         If so, is the format correct?  _______________________  What is the format of the input?____________________ Note: This may seem like a redundant question.  However, it is possible the user may have made an error or possibly not loaded the latest CD-ROM release.  The latest CD-ROM version should be filed to match the release loads.  The program could have been changed during the last release load.             7.  Have you checked the worldwide DIREP listing?                         What DIREPs are currently listed?_________________ Note: It is possible that you may have a legitimate error condition.  If other bases have reported the problem to Gunter, chances are there is an open DIREP on the error condition.  The DIREP listing can provide you with a workaround for the error condition or a future release date when the problem will be fixed.             8.  Are there any system advisory notices (SANs) or messages on the problem?                         What SANs are currently active?_________________ Note: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 161 If there is a legitimate error condition, there may be a SAN or message on the condition.  If there is a SAN or message, it will provide you with a current workaround for the problem.  Have you checked AF Form 636 for special instructions or files containing documentation procedures?             9.  Have you checked the programs against the last PBI listing?  _______________ Is the correct version of the program loaded?_______  What is the version date/time of the program?  _________________________________ Note: Sometimes, the wrong version of software may be in use at a base.  Users should check their software by performing the @PRT,TL command against file 0GV00000*GVABSUD001., and also check the version that is registered to TIP by doing the following in Demand Mode:             @BK1             @XQT,MUZIAX TIP$*TIPRUN$/TIP.TPUR             LIST 3             @BK2,E             L (PGM #)  I.E.: LC NGV601             P 10 Users should check the date/time stamps listed against the PBI listing from the last release load.  Dates of the ECL will not always match the ABS.  That is because ECL runstreams are changed via IPF or EDITOR whereas the ABSOLUTES are generated prior to release with the compile date/time stamp.             10.  Have you checked the ECL against the last PBI listing?  _______________ Note: Sometimes, the ECL may be the wrong version, or it may have been altered at a base.  Users can validate the ECL in the same manner as above by performing an @PRT,TL command against GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.             11.  Do you have INQ on stock number, document number, and ISG?  ____________ Note: Having all inquiries gives the user and controller a complete picture of the corresponding records in the database.             12.  Have you researched the reject condition thoroughly?                         What is the reject number?__________________________                         What program is the reject coming from?_____________                         What circumstances led to the reject?_______________ Note: Each reject must be researched thoroughly at base-level before calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  AFH 23-123, Pt 2, Vol 2, Ch 7, provides detailed instructions AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 162 and corrective actions for SBSS reject and management notices.  These corrective actions must be carried out before calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  Keep notes of these actions.  Should it become necessary to DIREP the program or to contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, this information will be needed.  It is essential to understand the circumstances leading to the reject.  Was the input initiated at the CSB, PSEUDO, satellite, etc.?  Was the input processed through the Overview Purpose Screen or a specific screen designed for the transaction?  Keep these facts in mind and write them down as you discover them.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will be asking the same questions.             13.  Is the reject a 799REJ?  If so, complete the following:                         Rollback Code:  _______                         Error Function:  _______                         Error Code:  _______                         Error Number:  _______                         Error Area:  _______                         Error Record:  _______                         Error Set:  _______                         Current Area:  _______ Note: 799REJs are indeed a challenge.  They are not standard SBSS rejects.  These rejects occur when a peculiar situation arises in the program, but there is no corresponding SBSS reject, as yet, to identify the corrective actions necessary to resolve it.  However, this does not excuse you from researching and analyzing the reject.  Indeed, your talents as an analyst will surely be tested.  Even though AFH 23-123, Pt 2, Vol 2, Ch 7 says to contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity as a corrective action, you must analyze the reject first.  Calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity to inform them you have a 799REJ does not resolve the problem.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity must know the circumstances leading to the reject.  Have the reject handy; it will provide a lot of information.  For example, the rollback codes, error codes, functions, and numbers will provide a lot of insight in to what the program is trying to do.  See Para. 2.135. for an explanation of the most common codes and key fields produced by the reject.  It is your responsibility to do everything possible to resolve the problem before you contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  If it does prove necessary to contact the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity, make sure you have all the information ready that you have found in order to assist the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity in resolving your problem.             14.  Have you processed the reject or suspect transaction with a TRACE?_______ Note: TRACEs provide a great deal of insight into the working interactions of the software.  It takes a great deal of practice and patience to research the TRACE output, but the information learned is rewarding.  You can see the programs that are called, the records that are read and written, and AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 163 the output it produces.  To process a TRACE against a suspect transaction, you must complete the following steps: STEP               ACTION REQUIRED (a)                    SX all files in the queue RJPR01.  This step is not                          necessary if your print server is active. (b)                   Stop all TIP processing.  For ALN systems with multiple                         ALNs coordinate with all the other ALN users. (c)                   Turn on all sense switches (1, 2, and 3) (d)                   Process TRACE (e)                   Turn off all sense switches (1, 2, and 3) (f)                   After processing the input, the TRACE printout will be in                         RJPR01.  Redirect print queue to your line printer.                         Or in designated PS$$0000 file if using print server. (g)                   Now, read the TRACE printout and follow the processes that                         occurred and led to reject.  Carefully note the programs                         called, records accessed, and, of course, any errors                         identified. (h)                  Resume normal TIP processing.             15.  Do you suspect the report or transaction is looping?  ___________________                         Have you run the Universal Data System (UDS) Monitor?  If not, run it.                         Did you find that the program was looping on a database key (DBK)?  ___________________                         Have you run appropriate INQs to research the loop?  ___________________                         If not, run them. Note: The only sure way of detecting and defining a looping condition within the UDS is through the UDS Monitor.  This monitor permits you to see the DBKs that the program is accessing as it is processing.  If you see that a particular DBK is constant, that is a clue the program is looping on that record.  At this point, you may abort the program and run a DBK inquiry to identify the record causing the looping condition.  From this point on, you can run other inquiries that will help you research the condition thoroughly (such as stock number, document number, organization cost center record (OCCR), etc.).  To start the UDS Monitor, use the following instructions:             Initiate the monitor by the following keyin:                         >@ADD 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.MONITOR AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 164             When prompted by UDS Monitor , take the following options:                         M (Menu)                         J (For Job.  This will provide the status of Data Management Routine (DMR)                               runs.)                         Slot (Enter the slot number of the job you wish to monitor.)                          Number             Now you will be able to observe the suspect run as it is progressing through the DMR.             16.  Is the problem you are experiencing the result of a Computer Operating Base                           (COB) error?                         What is the COB error?  ____________________________________                         What is the filename giving the error?  ____________________ Note: COB errors identify file errors that occur when the SBSS programs are attempting to access SSDF or MSAM files.  At times, the problem can be traced to an individual who is looking at the file through CTS or Text Editor and the End-of-File (EOF) marker.  Some of the most common are:             1101A --- Attempted to open a file which is already open.  This error could be a program error which results when attempting to open a file twice without an intervening close.  Another answer could be that a prior run or program did not complete and left a file open which it should have closed on an abort.  If the program was cataloged by the active program, you should be able to delete the file and rerun.  Another possibility is the file is an input file and the first transaction within the file is blank.  Verify the file and make appropriate corrections.             1103A --- No equipment assigned to file.  The program or run is trying to use a file that does not exist.  The missing file could be due to a wrong option within the ECL (that is, HOST ILO SITE) or the control image was wrong (that is, wrong disk/tape file specified).  Another possibility is that a wrong qualifier was used for the filename.  A file could be missing if there were input transactions and all the inputs rejected.  Therefore, no file was assigned for the program to process against.             1105A --- Attempted to write to an unopened file.  The program is attempting to write to a file that has not yet been opened.  This is a program error which is usually beyond your control.  You can, however, use QLP to check the transaction history records for invalid system designators.  If any are found, make a note of the transaction involved and use NGV299R to correct the system designator.             1147A --- Attempted to write beyond maximum mass-storage assignment.  This error occurs when the program is attempting to write beyond the maximum granule assignment for the output file specified in the ECL.  This may be corrected by replacing the assign statement within the ECL to a larger size and rerunning the program.             XX18A --- Empty or invalid file structure or file lacks extended parameters.  This error usually occurs when the program is trying to use a file that has nothing in it.  You need to re-AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 165 create the file by loading it back from a SAVEALL, rerunning the program that initially created the file, or re-creating the file by inputting the data, if that is how it was created.  If the file has data in it, then it probably was caused by inputting data in the wrong format.  This could have been caused by using @DATA,I which puts field data into an systems data file (SDF) file ILO using @DATA,IQ for ASCII data or vice versa.  This can be caused when someone reads the file with CTS and replaces it with ASCII OFF when it was supposed to be in ASCII or vice versa.  To correct this condition, initiate CTS, ASSUME ASCII ON (or OFF, whichever is applicable), do a call on the old file, and then do a REPLACE.  You can also re-create the file by reinputting the data properly or loading it back from a SAVEALL.  All of this depends upon what the file was used for and how it was created.             XX18A --- File lacks extended parameters.  This error usually indicates that a file has been accessed through CTS, a replace was done, and it destroyed the extended parameters.  You will have to re-create/load the file depending on how it was originally created.             17.  Have someone available with a working knowledge of QLP, SURGE, ECL, NGV299R, IPF, and TOCED. Note: It is imperative that the individual contacting the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is not only knowledgeable of the problem, but is able to perform the actions necessary to carry out the directives of the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and to understand why these actions are necessary.             AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity  2.136.  799 Reject Notices. 2.136.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  system  generated  rejects  when  no  encoding  within  the application  has  been  established.    References  used  to  research  799REJ  are  UP7992  and UP8079  (small  pocket  version).    These  references  provide  detailed  explanations  for  the rollback,  error  codes,  numbers,  and  functions  identified  by  the  reject.    These  publications should be within easy reach of the operator on duty.  The following paragraphs will help you better understand the basic explanation of these codes and how they relate to you. 2.136.2.  Detailed Specifics on 799 Reject Notices. 2.136.2.1.  The error function on a 799 reject notice indicates what action the program was trying to take when an error occurred.  Some of the most common error functions are listed below: 2.136.2.1.1.  02 -- The program was attempting to DELETE a record from the database. 2.136.2.1.2.  03 -- The program was attempting to READ a record from the database. 2.136.2.1.3.  08 -- The program was attempting to CHANGE an existing record in the database. 2.136.2.1.4.  09 -- The program was attempting to OPEN an area of the database such as ITMDTL-GV-1.  The area must be open before the program can access records in the area. 2.136.2.1.5.  12 -- The program was attempting to ADD a record to the database. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 166 2.136.2.2.  The error code/number gives a specific result of the last function requested by an application program.  It may be easier to understand error numbers if you look at them as  status  codes  versus  error  codes.    It  should  be  understood  to  the  application  program, error codes are frequently received and provide meaningful information to the program.  For example, an ISU input requires the program to read (FETCH) the item record of the stock number on the input.  If the item record is not loaded, the system passes back an error number of 13.  The application program interprets this to mean it could not find the item record and a 295 reject notice ITEM RECORD NOT LOADED - SEE CHAP 7 is produced.  However, under other circumstances, the application may be expecting only a successful status.    Therefore,  if  an  error  number  other  than  00  is  returned,  a  799  reject  notice  is produced.  An example of this would be:  A program reads a controlled item phrase to print it on an output document.  It reads the item phrase based on the controlled item code loaded on the item record, and it relies on an SBSS principle that says you do not have controlled item codes loaded on item records when there are no controlled item phrases loaded.  Using this principle, if any status other than 00 is returned, a 799 reject notice is produced.  At this point, a new, more specific reject could have been produced stating that a controlled item phrase was not loaded but it wasn't and most likely will not be until someone identifies and DIREPs the problem.  Some of the more common error codes are provided here: 2.136.2.2.1.  00 -- Last database access was successful, no error occurred, erroneous 799 reject notice if this error code appears. 2.136.2.2.2.  05 -- Violation of duplicates not allowed clause.  Typically, this occurs when  attempting  to  add  a  new  record  or  MODIFY  a  record  whose  CALC-key duplicates another record's CALC-key already loaded in the database, and the SBSS schema definition contains the phrase DUPLICATES NOT ALLOWED for that record type. 2.136.2.2.3.  06  --  No  current  record  of  area/record/set  name.    This  error  usually indicates a true programming error.  The application program said read the next record in a set or area; however, it failed to read the first record in the set or area.  Or, it said read an owner  record and assumed the error number to  be 00, but  it wasn't.    It  then executed a read of the first record in the chain when there is no current owner's record established. 2.136.2.2.4.  07 -- End of set/area/chain.  Once again, this status is quite often returned to the application program.  For example, an inquiry for all details continues to read details until a status of 07 is returned.  At that time, the inquiry program puts out the END OF  INQUIRY and terminates normally.  However, if a program  was trying to read a due-in detail using the due-in document number loaded on a due-out detail, and it is assumed the due-in detail would be found, any status other than 00 may result in a 799 reject notice.  Once again, at this point, the application program could put out a new reject indicating the due-in detail document number of the due-out was invalid or the old stand-by 260 reject notice DETAIL NOT LOADED. 2.136.2.2.5.  08 -- Record not defined in set/area or record does not contain specified keys.    This  is  generally  a  true  programming  error.    For  example,  the  application program said read a due-in detail within the authorized in-use set.  Looking at the SBSS schema you can tell that due-in details are not included in the authorized in-use set. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 167 2.136.2.2.6.  09 -- Improper area usage.  When an application opens an area, it must specify  a  mode;  for  example,  retrieval  or  update.    If  it  is  opened  for  retrieval,  any attempts to update the area will result in this error. 2.136.2.2.7.  13 -- No record or set occurrence satisfies criteria.  Typically, this error is produced  when  the  application  program  has  specified  that  a  specific  record  with  a specific key will be read.  An example would be that the program said to read a specific document number record, but that record was not on file. 2.136.2.2.8.  34 -- Area cannot be assigned.  This error is produced when the database area attempting to be accessed is not registered and assigned to TIP.  Since the SBSS uses an EXEC database, this error would only be received in an application compile error. 2.136.2.2.9.  84 -- Overflow pages associated with data pages have all been allocated.  This  error  indicates  you  have  run  out  of  overflow  pages  to  allocate  for  storing  new records.  You need to do a database resizing.  However, this is truly one error that you can tell your users to, “Try it at a later time, and it might work,” until you can do the resize.  The reason for this is that perhaps a record on the page where the new record will be loaded will have a record deleted and allow space to load a new record. 2.136.2.2.10.  92 -- Database key found vacancy entry.  Without a doubt, if you receive this error, you have database pointer problems. 2.136.2.2.11.  98  --  Invalid  area  code/page  number.    Again,  you  have  structure problems within the database.  Process a DMU AREA VERIFY to help pinpoint errors.  Remember,  DIRECT  access  records  cannot  be  verified  by  DMU  VERIFY.    For example, if the program is looking for the Inventory Adjustment Control record (507), it looks on page one, record one.  This is the only place the 507 can be stored.  If it is not  there  a  98  error  will  result.    The  program  could  also  be  looking  for  a  specific database key and the record is not there.  This would also result in a 98 error.  VERIFY cannot check these conditions.  Record fetched is not of expected type. 2.136.2.2.12.  100 -- Dynamic page expansion limit.  See error number 84 above for details.  The difference is this error number only occurs on areas defined in the SBSS schema with a DYNAMICALLY EXPANDABLE TO clause. 2.136.2.2.13.  122 -- Generalized name error.  If bases do an @START on programs, they will get this error if the first digit of the project code on the RUN image does not equal 1 through 8.  This error will also result if the base does an @XQT,S and the first digit of the project code is already a 5 through 8.  This is because the first digit is used to  identify  the  gang  number.    If  it  is  a  zero,  the  application  program  cannot  open SUPRT-NGV-0.  Hence, an error code 122 may result because of a simple project code error on the @RUN image.  Always check this condition first. 2.136.2.3.  Rollback (RB) Codes.  A rollback code indicates that any update the application program may have made since starting, or since it executed its last FREE DMR command, will be undone.  This leaves the database looking like it did before the start of the program or just prior to its last FREE command.  Some of the more common RB codes are listed here: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 168 2.136.2.3.1.  00 -- A rollback did not take place. 2.136.2.3.2.  06  --  Not  enough  quick-look  file  space  allocated.    The  program  has accomplished too many updates without doing an internal FREE command.  Attempt to  process  the program  later with  a different  mix of programs  on the system.    If the error persists, you must submit a DIREP on the applicable application program. 2.136.2.3.3.  14 -- Trying to access a downed area.  If this occurs, most likely one of two things is happening:  Your primary to secondary database copy is in progress and has marked the gang down.  (In this case, take no action until your crossover terminates, which normally results in bringing the gang back up.) Or, an attempted recovery has not  finished successfully, resulting in  the  areas being left marked down.   Generally, @ADDing runstreams out of the 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$. to up the gang should not be accomplished until you have determined the reason the area has been marked down. 2.136.2.3.4.  66 -- Downed area list inconsistency.  This error will normally occur only during  database  conversion  processes  when  there  has  been  a  procedural  error.    For example,  the  runstream  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR  is  processed  to register a new schema when there are areas in the prior schema definition which are marked down. the ECL 2.136.2.3.5.  83  --  Schema  aborted.    This  error  condition  can  only  be  corrected  by processing runstream 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR.    However,  running  a  schema  clear before finding and fixing the problem which caused the schema abort will most likely result in the same error recurring.  The most common cause of this error, if it happens on a continuous basis, is either numerous pointer and/or CALC-chain errors. following 2.136.2.4.  Current Area.  This field is used by the programmer to identify the paragraph name within the Common Business-oriented Language (COBOL) program.  This may or may not provide you, at base level, an insight on the function being performed that actually caused  the  reject.    By  following  structure  programming  standards,  paragraphs  within programs  should  have  meaningful  names.    Hopefully,  by  knowing  the  paragraph  name, you  will  be  able  to  determine  a  little  more  clearly  the  function  being  attempted  by  the program. 2.137.  Controlled TRIC Table. 2.137.1.  Purpose.  To provide a list of TRICs that must be controlled.  These Controlled TRICs are  loaded  into  the  terminal  security  system  with  a  1SZB  input.    Note:    The  Information Assurance Officer should coordinate with the DFAS field site to determine the A&F TRICs that are deemed most critical and should be loaded as controlled TRICs in the SBSS, based on available space. 2.137.2.

This is positions 81, 161, 241, or 321 used to allow simulation of other terminals.  It will also control the PSU TRIC used to process pseudo inputs. 5.  TRIC XSE should only be processed at base level if directed to do so by the MAJCOM Reporting Organization File Manager.  TRIC XSE is transceived from AFEMS (C001) to the SBSS.  Inbound SIFS control record should be configured to send the XSE to the pseudo for processing. 2.138.  New TRIC Loads. 2.138.1.  Purpose.  To load or add new TRIC(s) to the controlled TRIC table in the security file.  Once this input is processed, only authorized user-IDs can use the TRIC(s).  This input should be processed in online mode.  When using online mode,  you should use TIP Screen 436.  Process in online mode at a host or satellite account to load new TRICs.  Process new TRIC(s) in Demand mode at the host base during initial implementation, satellite rehoming, or if the TIP security files need to be re-created.  This process is accomplished through use of IPF or any ASCII text editor. 2.138.2.  Input Format. Table 2.40.  Input Format.

If AL is entered, all terminals are affected regardless of the system designator. 2.  Valid function numbers are 000 through 999.  Leave blank when all terminals for system designator entered in positions 9-10 are affected. 3.  Authorized messages are as follows: INIT input affects only BASE-CONSTANTS-2 (014) records that have type equipment  codes 21, 28, and 37 with non-pseudo PIDs (less than 99900).  This request message moves spaces to the 001-UP-DOWN-FLAG (UP STATUS) provided the PID is active in the system; otherwise it is set to 2.  INIT input moves spaces to the database record field 001-OVERRIDE-FUNCTION-NUMBER (UP) and normal input/output is resumed.  When AL is entered as a system designator, an interactive communication interface (ICI) ready up (ICIRDYUP) is automatically processed if any system designator has an active ADS interface. STOP INPUT sets the 001-UP-DOWN-FLAG to 1 if the current status is a space; the 001- TYPE-DEVICE = 21, 28, 37, or 99; the PID is less than 99900; and the function number is not AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 183 057.  Otherwise, no action is taken.  When AL is entered as a system designator, an interactive communication interface ready down (ICIRDYDN) is automatically processed if any system designator has an active ADS interface. STOP OUTPUT sets 001-OUTPUT-OVERRIDE to 444 if 001-TYPE-DEVICE is 21, 28,  37, or 99; the PID is less than 99900; and function number is not 057.  If the STOP OUTPUT is for function number 444, then the 001-OUTPUT-OVERRIDE is set to 445. DISABLE sets the 001-UP-DOWN-FLG to equal 3 if the following conditions are met:   The 001-TYPE-DEVICE is 21, 28, 37, or 99.  The PID is not 99900 or greater.

This status can be obtained by the following operations: -- The current status is 2 and an *OPEN input is processed. -- A COM REM INIT is processed with the following conditions met: --- The position identifier (PID) is currently signed on through the EXEC. --- The 014-TYPE-DEVICE is 21, 28, 37, or 99. --- The PID is not 99900 or greater. - Terminal is marked as an OUTPUT ONLY device.  Inputs are rejected by the SBSS to the user.  This status can only be set by a COM REM STOP INPUT transaction. - Terminal is marked down--no input or output.  However, processing an *OPEN from that terminal will change the value from 2 to a space, thus allowing both input and output.  This status can be obtained by the following operations: -- The last user processed an $$CLOSE. -- An END image is processed and the status at the time of the END image is either a space or a 1. - Terminal is marked down--no input or output.  In addition, the processing of an *OPEN will be rejected by the SBSS.  A COM REM INIT must be processed for a terminal in this condition before the user can successfully process and *OPEN and begin SBSS transaction processing. -- Note:  This status can be set only by a COM REM DOWN transaction. 2.150.3.

Purpose.    To  change  the  SBSS  database  from  online  to  twilight.    If  the  001-UP-DOWN-FLAG equals a space or 1, the 001-UP-DOWN-FLAG is set to 2 (no input or output allowed).  Also, if any system designator has an automated data system (ADS) interface active, it processes an ICIRDYDN (marks ICI processor down).  Any attempt to input data results in a  notice  to  the  input  terminal  that  the  SBSS  is  in  the  twilight  mode  and  inputs  will  not  be accepted.  If the remote processing station ( AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity) does not want terminals signing on and processing immediately after restarting online (that is, manual processing), then the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will process a AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 186 COM REM AL DISABLE before or after the END image processing.

Once all online and essential twilight processing has been completed this report image builds the applicable secondary database for mandatory end-of-day reports processing.  When processed on the secondary database it breaks the reports sequence control record (520); thus,  allowing reports to  be processed out  of sequence.  Caution must be used anytime this image is to processed. 2.160.2.  Input Format. Table 2.64.  Input Format.

The FIXRECFILE is saved on the SBSS EXEMPT tape and the FIXPUTFILE is saved on the SBSS NON-EXEMPT tape.  The following will re-create these files if you do not want to recover these two files from tape.  However, if you are on a DMC you must notify all other ALN gang 1 OPRS because the FIXRECFILE is exempt and accessed by all ALN numbers on the DMC:   @START 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.CREATE/FIXREC 11.  These two files are released from AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity for each new screen and/or forms.  The following runstreams are displayed to explain each function.  Each of these affects your applicable ALN only.  @START GV$$0000*TCBRUN$.LOAD/GV-SCREENS copies the release file  0GV00000*REL-SCRRENS. into 0GV00000*SAV-SCREENS., then updates TIP file TIP$*<ALN>$$000177.

File Recovery From SBSS Backup Tapes. 2.162.1.  Purpose.  To recover standard SBSS filenames from tape.  The procedures described in this paragraph require access to a demand terminal and only apply to the SBSS backup tapes created using the following runstreams.  Gang 1 on each ALN is responsible for coordination with all users, including other ALNs assigned to your DMC.   If an exempt file needs to be reloaded, the systems monitor for each ALN must coordinate when and how.  You may also, if desired, create your own tape backup and restore for your ALN unique files. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 198 2.162.1.1.  @START 0GV00000*DBWORK.CREATE/GVEXECUT001.  Exempt SBSS files 2.162.1.2.  @START 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC.  ALN unique files 2.162.2.  Precautions.    Prior  to  utilizing  the  procedures  in  the  following  paragraphs,  certain precautions must be taken. 2.162.2.1.  The  appropriate  reel  numbers  containing  the  files  to  be  recovered  must  be cataloged as the current cycle of the appropriate tape file-ID. 2.162.2.1.1.  EXAMPLE: files  or 0GV0<ALN>*GVEXECUT001. for non-exempt.  This may be verified by processing an  @PRT,F  against  the  applicable  filename.    Therefore,  by  entering  the  following command, tape reel numbers can be verified:   0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. for  exempt 2.162.2.1.1.1.  @PRT,F 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. 2.162.2.1.2.  If the file 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. is cataloged, a printout similar to the following sample will be obtained: 2.162.2.1.2.1.  * * PROJ:  xxxxxx           ACCNT:  xxxxxxx   * * 2.162.2.1.2.2.  0GV00000*GVEXECUT001(1),U9,B00099/B00098/B00097 2.162.2.1.2.3.  MODES: PUBLIC 2.162.2.1.2.4.  TAPEMODES:  6250-BPI,ODD-PARITY,8-BIT 2.162.2.1.2.5.  CAT: 07/21/93 AT 20:00:00, LAST REF:  07/21/93 AT 21:10:00 2.162.2.1.2.6.  In  the  above  example  the  tape  numbers  associated  with  file 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001. are B00099, B00098, and B00097.  The file cycle is 1.  The file-ID was cataloged on 21 Jul 93 at 2000:00 2.162.2.2.  If  the  file  is  cataloged  and  the  correct  tape  reel  numbers  are  included  in  the printout, proceed to Entry Commands paragraph below. 2.162.2.3.  If the file was not cataloged or if the tape reel numbers to be used for recovery are not correct (such as, tape numbers B00099, B00098, and B00097 listed in the above example are not the correct tape reel numbers to be recovered from), a new catalog entry must be established to reflect the correct tape reel numbers to be used.  For example:  If the correct tape numbers to be used in the recovery of the above example were B00088 and B00087, the following catalog entry must be processed: 2.162.2.3.1.  @CAT,PV 0GV00000*GVEXECUT001(+1).,U9,B00088/B00087 2.162.2.3.2.  After the catalog entry has been processed, repeat the actions in paragraph above to verify the catalog process was successful. 2.162.3.  Entry  Commands. accomplished, CREATE/ALN-EXEC as an example): the  following  procedures  must  be  executed  (using   Once  the  verification  described  has  been  successfully the  non-exempt 2.162.3.1.

At  this  point  the  DMC  operator  will  receive  the  appropriate  tape  mount message: 2.162.3.4.1.  @COPY,G 0GV0<ALN>*GVEXECUT001.,TPF$. 2.162.3.5.  Once the operator has serviced the tape request, the first data file will be read from tape and written into TPF.  When the cursor returns and the phrase xxxx number of blocks copied appears, enter the following command: 2.162.3.5.1.  @ADD SELECT/FILES                        (for Exempt files) 2.162.3.5.2.  @ADD SELECT/ALN-FILES              (for ALN unique files) 2.162.3.6.  From  this  point  on,  the  recovery  is  a  prompted  process.    Respond  to  the questions following the instructions provided on the screen. 2.163.  IRU History/Key File. 2.163.1.  Purpose.  To provide a list of tapes used in previous IRU dumps or recovery.  Any time an IRU dump or recovery is performed, data pertaining to each area is recorded in the IRU  history  file.    This  data  is  very  useful  in  deciding  which  tape  numbers  are  used  in  a recovery.    This  file  is  printed  by  executing  runstream  0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.TAPE-NBR/GV-x. 2.163.2.  Example.  This runstream is set up to provide data on the ITMDTL-GV-x area only.  If you want to view any other area, change the runstream to reflect the EXEC filename.  An @ADD or @Start of this runstream prints the entire contents.  To browse through the file in chronological sequence, input the commands in demand mode.  Data for each tape file appears.  To look at the next tape file, enter continue.  To exit IRU, enter stop. @RUN   TAPE1,,xGV0                    . x = gang number @IRU,UIX                              . activate IRU REPORT HISTORY OF DUMPS FILE DMS$<ALN>*ITMDTL-GV-1; ACT;      @EOF                                  . exit IRU FILE : DMS$<ALN>*ITMDTL-GV-1  **********************************************************                                      file-type    : EXEC file status: AVAILABLE               number-dumps : 2 DUMP ------------------------------------------- dump-status  : COMPLETE         dump-type        : STATIC start-dump-time : 91/02/07 08:31:19 end-dump-time   : 93/02/07 08:32:58 audit-trail-tape: H00360        device           : U9S TAPE ------------------------------------------------ AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 200 tape-number      : B00064   device-type   : U9 start-record/page: 1     end-record/page  : 8190 start-bsn start-bsn        : 1     end-bsn          : 2048 2.163.2.1.

This file is released by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity and provides runstreams necessary to set up your TIP environment after a system crash and/or system boot. 2.165.  Audit Trail History File. 2.165.1.  Purpose.  To provide a list of audit trail tapes in the event of an audit trail or STR recovery.  Each time an audit trail tape is opened, closed, or swapped, the action is recorded in a history file.  This file should be used by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity personnel prior to and after any recovery.  Information provided in this file and the IRU history file  is  sufficient  to  determine  beginning  and  ending  tape  numbers  and  times.    Prior  to  a recovery, review this list and coordinate which tapes are required.  After the recovery, this list can be matched against the recovery printed output to ensure a tape was not skipped.  Skipping AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 202 audit tapes during a recovery will undoubtedly require reprocessing the IRU recovery or the STR recovery.  If audit trail tapes have to be skipped, then a STR recovery is required.  To print the file, execute 0GV0<ALN>*DBRUN$.AUDIT-TRAIL/REPORT.  The runstream is as follows: 2.165.1.1.  @IRU,UIX 2.165.1.2.  REPORT ACI ALL; ACT;  . or REPORT ACI LAST 10 2.165.1.3.  (for last 10 tapes) 2.165.1.4.  EXIT 2.165.1.5.

Overview.  Database  maintenance  is  probably  one  of  the  easiest,  yet  most  misunderstood functions of any database management system.  The DMS 1100 system used by the SBSS utilizes a DMS  (Data Management  System) environment.   The DMS  database  consists  of two types of DMS  areas;  SARP  (Standard  Area  Record  Placement)  and  DARP  (Dynamic  Area  Record Placement).  SARP areas are standard in size while DARP areas expand as more area is needed.  The type of area used is based upon the type of records stored within the area.  UP-7907.3 will better explain the database design and utilization procedures.  There are two databases discussed in this chapter:  the GV database and the CTH (Consolidated Transaction History) database.  For further information on these areas or any DMS questions, refer to your CAR (customer account representative) for Unisys publications.  These will be located in AF INDEX 2. for the secondary, 3.1.1.  The standard GV database consists of 59 areas.  Twenty nine areas for the primary, 29 areas the DMS$<ALN>*SYSAREAS-GV.  This is a stand-alone DMS area which contains two basic records; the 015-SUPRT-KEYS and the 100-SYSTEM-AREAS.  This area must always be up (assigned to the Exec) with these two records installed.  Without it, GV or CTH cannot operate.  The CTH database areas are explained in Sec. 3D. areas  which and  one for the systems is 3.1.2.  Each area contains the sets and records necessary to make the SBSS operational.  These areas are sized to provide the best performance possible while accessing the database.  Areas too small causes storage problems while a database too large causes excessive input/output. 3.2.  Defining a Database.  Each database is a collection of interrelated data.  Think of a database in physical as well as logical terms.  The following are the basic components of a DMS database: 3.2.1.  Area/Page/Record.  Each database area is subdivided into pages, the unit of storage used by input, output, and locking.  Each page contains records.  A record is a collection of related items of data.  You store, add, delete, or modify records of data.  You find these records on a page  by  using  their  database  keys  which  is  the  physical  address  of  each  record.    This  key consists  of  an  area  code,  page  number,  and  record  number.    Database  keys  are  used  in  the retrieval of these records. 3.2.2.  Data  Items.  Each record  contains data.  The basic unit of data is  the data item.   An example of a data item is the stock number on the item record.  Data items are logically grouped into records; records are logically related by sets and are logically grouped into areas.  A data item is an entity, such as a name or quantity within a record.  You have to use some means to define the database to the user and the application programs.  This definition is called a schema. 3.3.  Defining a Schema and Subschema.  The schema starts with an input source code of the database definitions.  These definitions contain the description of the database.  You must name the  areas,  sets,  records,  sizes  of  these  areas,  sets,  records  and  the  relationship  of  each.    AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  uses  DDL  (Data  Definition  Language)  and  SDDL (Subschema  Data  Definition  Language)  to  compile  the  Schemas  and  Subschemas  used  by  the SBSS.  The schema is the users view of the database.  After the schema has been compiled, use AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 234 SDDL to describe the database, or subset of the database that is visible to the application programs.  This is called a subschema. 3.4.  Storage  Techniques.  DMS  uses  two  types  of  areas;  SARP  and  DARP.    SARP  was  the method first developed to allocate data pages for record storage.  DARP was developed to let you initially allocate the minimum number of data pages only, with the DMR  dynamically allocating additional pages and overflow pages as needed.  Since the SBSS changes, it may become necessary from time to time to resize, either downsize or increase the DMS areas.  This is part of the resizing function of the SBSS. 3.4.1.  DMS  1100  utilities  can  help  determine  if  resizing  is  required.    Utilities  such  as VERIFY/GV-x, VERIFY/CALCx (x equals gang number) displays record counts as well as page usage.  DMS uses the 799 reject to inform the user these areas are full.  The error number 84 is when all overflow pages contain insufficient space to store another record.  Another error which changed with the DMS-EXEC environment was the reject 799 Error number 100.  This error is replaced by an I/O error 22 for all DMS-EXEC areas.  These errors can be caused by a number of system problems.  Power fluxes and equipment failures attribute to most of these.  Bad  database  recoveries  can  also  create  these  errors.    The  DMU  utilities  can  explain  the majority of errors with your database.  DMU will never verify that the data contained on the pages are correct; its function is to verify that the physical pages are intact.  The following is an example of DMU verify for SRD-GV-1:             Key-in:  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DMU       System Response: DMU 13R4 75R4Q7 01/14/97 13:11:44 DMS 2200 BUILD ID DMSGEN-02       INVOKE SUBSCHEMA SBSS-DMU1       IN FILE DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA       OF SCHEMA SBSS-SCHEMA       KEY FOR INVOKE IS 'WHISTLE'.

Although the above example displays 15 percent unused for prime and total pages and the overflow is 20 percent unused, you can still receive 07/12/84 and/or I/O 22 errors.  The reason being is the way DMS works.  In the DMS environment, each overflow page can only be associated with one prime page.  If the run unit writes to the prime page and requires an overflow page, the DMR will assign an overflow page to that prime page unless all overflow pages have been exhausted, thus receiving a 799 12/91/084.  Although DMU verify displays 15 percent to 20 percent unused, that is because this is the total space available on all pages total.  For instance, if the run unit required an overflow page, the DMR will check the next available page (from page 0).  If none can be found then all pages have been allocated.  The run unit may have only written one record to the associated overflow page; the only way to write to that particular overflow page again is if its owner (prime) page requires an overflow page.  Thus, with one record only on that page, the percentage of unused is actual space not written  to.    Although  this  output  of  DMU  shows  no  errors,  it  displays  the  area  usage  and remainder of space available for record storage. 3.4.3.  The next most used DMU utility is the VERIFY-CALC routine.  This routine verifies the  CALC  chain  integrity  for  the  input  area.    DMU  checks  for  chain  completeness  in  both forward  and  backward  locations.    This  is  done  by  reading  to  forward  and/or  prior  links.  Although the complete option is released in 0GV0*DBRUN$., there are various options for this DMU verify.  See UP-7909.6 for detailed options of DMU. 3.4.4.  Area  Codes.    Each  DMS-EXEC  area  within  the  UDS  (Universal  Data  System)  is assigned its unique area code.  This number is used by the DMR to determine which DMS-EXEC file will be used by the application program. Section 3B—-Database Download And Upload 3.5.  Database  Download.  The  download  program  must  be  processed  anytime  you  resize  the database,  with  exception  to  the  TXHIST  area.    When  you  process  the  download  and  upload programs, it keeps your database clean of orphan records.  These records are named this by being delinked or separated from their perspective owners and or members.  Records such as the 103 and some other owner records are not downloaded.  This is because the upload will create these records for  the  proper  linkage  criteria.    It  is  recommended  that  download  and  upload  be  processed  as required to maintain your database in an efficient manner.  After processing your download with no errors, start your upload.  This will initialize all the DMS areas and reload the database. 3.5.1.  Download Options.  Due to the complexity of the SBSS, only the COM (COMPLETE) option will be used for download.  Although there are selective options available, a working AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 236 knowledge of the schema and database is required for these options.  The download will read the owner record and walk the chain.  If this chain is broken, the download will error and finish prematurely.  This is why it is imperative to be as error free as possible before the run starts. 3.5.2.  Using  QLP  or  SURGE,  locate  any  ITEM-RECORDS  with  a  blank  101-STOCK-NUMBER  and  either  load  a  101-STOCK-NUMBER  or  delete  these  records.    The  upload program  stores  the  ITEM-RECORD  based  upon  the  101-STOCK-NUMBER  and  the  101-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR.  This will be used as the CALC-KEY.  If the stock number is blank, the upload program will not store this record or any of its associated member records.  These queries must be accomplished prior to the download. 3.6.  Database Upload.  Normally, the upload option is used when a base resizes areas or for a schema conversion.  There are six upload programs (NGV051 through NGV056).  The best way to find out which upload program loads which records is to process the full download and upload.  The printout for each upload program will show each record it fetches or stores.  Keep in mind that the upload programs may only fetch a particular type record (106 record as an example) but doesn't actually store it. 3.6.1.  EXAMPLE 1:  NGV051 stores the 106 records.  NGV053 stores some records that are owned by the 106 record.  NGV053 will fetch the already stored 106 to get currency and then store the particular record VIA SET.  The printout for NGV051 will show the number of reads for the 106 and a total of 0 stored for the 106.  Also some records that are not downloaded are uploaded. 3.6.2.  EXAMPLE 2:  The 902 record is not downloaded but is stored by one of the uploads.  NGV051 is a special case.  NGV051 stores many records but the most common use of NGV051 is in the 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/SYSAREAS runstream.  The download program does not download the 103-DOCUMENT-NBR records.  Therefore, if you have too many pointer errors or  this  area  is  just  too  corrupt,  you  must  first  correct  these  errors,  either  by  NDA500  or  a selective recovery, then process the download and upload programs.  The upload will rebuild the 103 records and relink them to their applicable member records.  There are  two options used by NGV051.  They are: 3.6.2.1.  SYA (SYSAREAS)  - this option used by  NGV051 will load only  two types of record.  The 015 and 100 are the only two records in the SYSAREAS-GV.  This option is used with run 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/SYSAREAS. 3.6.2.2.  COM  (COMPLETE)  -  this  option  is  used  to  load  ALL  records  with  NGV051, including the 015 and 100 records.  This is the only option used when doing a download and upload at base level operations. 3.6.2.3.  As each upload program  completes, a total record count will be displayed.  These counts are explained in the following: 3.6.2.4.  TOTAL INPUTS READ:  15000                                    Note 1 3.6.2.5.  TOTAL INPUTS NOT PROCESSED:  11350               Note 2 3.6.2.6.  TOTAL RECORDS STORED:  4250                             Note 3 3.6.2.7.  TOTAL RECORD ERRORS:  0                                     Note 4           Notes:  1.  This  is  the  total  number  of  records  read  from  the  input  tape.    DNLOAD  will  create  an AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 237 output tape with two sorted files.  These two files are read by the NLOAD programs.  This total represents the total of this input file.          2.  This is the total number of records on the input file NOT used by this particular upload program.  The upload program  will read the  complete  file  BUT  only  select  those  record  numbers  which  will  be  stored  by  this particular  upload  program.      3.    This  is  the  number  of  records  that  the  current  upload program has stored.  The number may be less or more than the records selected.  The upload program    will  create  certain  owner  records  that  were  NOT  downloaded.    Also,  in  most cases,  if  the  upload  program  encounters  a  dupe  record  and  the  schema  area  has DUPLICATES  NOT  ALLOWED,  it  will  skip  that  record.    103-DOCUMENT-NBR records are always created by the NGV052 program.      4.  Self-explanatory.  Displays and skips the record in error. 3.7.  Download/Upload  Without  Resizing.  To  process  the  download  and  upload  without resizing, process the following steps in order.  In the following runstreams, the letter x represents the applicable gang number.  These procedures must be followed as closely as possible.  Deviation will only delay valuable processing time. 3.7.1.  Ensure all pseudo processing has been completed. 3.7.2.  Process RPTRUN on the primary and ensure all mandatory reports on the secondary database, including RPTEON, have been processed. 3.7.3.  Presizing procedures.  x equals primary gang. 3.7.3.1.  @XQT   DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                            Note 1 3.7.3.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x                         Note 2 3.7.3.3.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx                     Note 2 3.7.3.4.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x                             Note 3 3.7.3.5.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x                          Note 3             Notes:   1.  For all sets, except CTH, enter:  1-65/80-102.  For all sets enter A for set options.   2.  Verify/GV will display record totals as well as detect any page errors on your database.  Verify/CALC will display broken or corrupt CALC chains.  Break point file for Verify/GV is XGV0*VERGVx.  Break point file for Verify/CALCx is XGV0*GVCALC.       3.  The DOWN will release all DMS areas from APPL01.  The secondary must be deleted.  Since the  database  key  formats  will  be  changed,  you  must  delete  the  secondary.    x  equals secondary gang number. 3.7.4.  Process all mandatory primary reports including RPTEON.  DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT  initialize  beginning  of  day.    There  must  be  no  transactions  until  after  all  of  these procedures have been completed. 3.7.5.  IRUDUMP your primary database.  Then, start the download.  The download program may run anywhere from  1 to 3 hours, depending upon the size of your database.  Since the download does not modify or delete records, restart is from beginning in the event of a system error. 3.7.5.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x                      Note 1 3.7.5.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.DNLOADx                                Note 2            Notes:  1.  Ensure this dump has NO read errors.  This is your safety dump in the event of a fallback.  AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 238 Recommend two dumps be taken.    2.  Save the output listing.  This list will display the total number of each record for all DMS areas downloaded.  The download program writes the selected records to tape, sorts them by record sequence, and then writes a second output tape labeled xGV0*GV-xTP.  The letter x equals primary gang number.  This tape will be used by the upload programs. 3.7.6.  Once the download is complete, reload all the records via NGV051 through NGV056.  The upload may take anywhere from 2 to 6 hours depending upon your database size.  NGV052 is the longest upload program due to the storing of item and detail records.  In the event of a program  abort,  restart  the  program  from  the  beginning.    This  is  because  with  66  sets,  237 records and 28 areas, it will ensure that all records are properly linked.  After the upload, dump your database.  Do not load any IRUDUMP tapes prior to this step or your database will be corrupted.    To  keep  a  clean  database,  the  download  and  upload,  without  resizing,  is recommended semiannually. 3.7.6.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/GV-x                         Note 1 3.7.6.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x                         Note 2 3.7.6.3.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx                     Note 2 3.7.6.4.  @XQT   DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                           Note 3 3.7.6.5.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x                    Note 4               Notes:   1.

For all sets, except CTH, enter:  1-65/80-102.  For all sets enter A for set options.  4.  This is your starting dump after the uploads.  DO NOT LOAD ANY DUMPS PRIOR TO THIS DUMP or your database will be corrupted.  Recommend two dumps be taken. Section 3C—-Resizing The Database 3.8.  Overview.  Before any resizing option is used, it must be understood which areas are to be sized.  Also, sizing for  mission growth, rehome gains or satellite additions should be discussed prior to the resize.  Disk pack utilization is also a major factor in the resizing process.  Always coordinate with your DBA (database administrator) prior to any resize for disk utilization. 3.9.  Presizing  Procedures.  Before  resizing,  you  must  first  download  the  database.    The following run will download the database records to a cataloged tape file xGV0*DBDWNLD.  It then rewinds the tape, sorts the records by executing  NGV058, and then writes the sorted output to tape file xGV0*GV-xTP.  x equals primary gang.  Before downloading the database, it must be as  free  as  possible  of  errors.    The  download  program  (NGV057)  will  run  with  limited  pointer errors;  however,  page  errors  will  abort  NGV057.    First  verify  your  database  with  DMU  and NDA500.  Remember to ensure all users are advised ahead of time and do not attempt to utilize the system until after all resizing procedures have been completed. 3.9.1.  Process all pseudo inputs and run any required SIFS utilities to clear out SIFS data. 3.9.2.  Process RPTRUN (crossover) on the primary and process all mandatory reports on the secondary including RPTEON on the secondary. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 239 3.9.3.  Process  all  mandatory  reports,  including  RPTEON,  on  the  primary.    DO  NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT initialize BOD (beginning-of-day).  There can be no transactions during these resize procedures. 3.9.4.  Process the following jobs.  Ensure they are error free before continuing with the next step: 3.9.4.1.  @XQT   DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                            Note 1 3.9.4.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x                         Note 2 3.9.4.3.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx                      Note 2 3.9.4.4.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x 3.9.4.5.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x                             Note 3 3.9.4.6.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x                          Note 3 3.9.4.7.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x            Notes:   1.  For all sets, except CTH, enter:  1-65/80-102.  For all sets, enter A for set options.     2.  Verify/GV will display record totals as well as detect any page errors on your database.  Verify/CALC will display  broken  or  corrupt  CALC  chains.    The  break  point  file  for  Verify/GV  is xGV0*VERGVx.    The  break  point  file  for  Verify/CALCx  is  xGV0*GVCALC.  (x  = primary gang number).    3.  The DOWN will release all DMS areas from APPL01.  Since the database key formats will be changed, the secondary must be deleted (x = secondary gang number). 3.9.5.  Once the above steps have been accomplished, error free, download the database.  This run downloads the database to tape, rewinds the tape for reading by NGV058, then writes the sorted records to a new tape file called xGV0*GV-xTP.  x equals primary gang. 3.9.5.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.DNLOADx 3.9.6.  After  this  job  fins,  print  your  output.    Visually  compare  record  totals  downloaded against the output from Verify/GV-x.  Totals for most records should match.  Not all records are downloaded because some are re-created by the upload program.  Also members or records belonging  to  empty  sets  are  deleted  on  the  download.    As  stated,  download  will  walk  the owners through the members.  One thing to keep in mind or check for is blank stock numbers on  the  ITEM-RECORDS.    Although  NGV057  will  download  these  records,  NGV052  will NOT upload these records because the CALC-key is built from the 101-STOCK-NUMBER and 101-SYSTEM-DESIGNATOR.  If the DNLOADx aborts or a restart is required for any reason, just restart DNLOADx.  As stated earlier, the DNLOADx does not delete or modify database records. 3.10.  Executing  NGVU31.  NGVU31  reads  and  resizes  the  schema  absolute  SBSS-SCHEMA based upon input from the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator.  NGVU31 is menu-driven and manual intervention of the output files should not be done.  NGVU31 interfaces with  NDAU31  for  schema  modification.    Manually  processing  NDAU31  can  cause  disastrous results.  Therefore, SBSS will use NGVU31 to resize their applicable schema.  Prior to executing NGVU31, save your catalog statements from your DBRUN$ file.  NGVU31 will not put your disk assignments on  your new catalog elements.  If  you don't use disk assignments, then there is no need to  save these elements.  The reason we don't  use the disk  assignments  is  if  your database AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 240 administrator  (DBA)  has  all  disk  assignments  set  to  a  particular  size,  the new  sizes  may  affect other files on that pack/disk. 3.10.1.  NGVU31 may be executed anytime and the ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA run can be processed later.  The NCOIC could size the area(s) in the morning and not actually install the new sizes or schema until later.  The only run that changes sizes or areas is the element created in the file 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA.  You can run NGVU31 as many times, but, until you start this run, nothing changes.  You must process NGVU31 with a nonexempt user-ID. 3.10.1.1.  KEYIN AND OPTIONS FOR NGVU31 3.10.1.2.  KEYIN:  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31 3.10.1.3.

After  selecting  the  appropriate  option  and  all  prompts  have  been  answered,  do  the following  to  create  0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.    This  file  contains  the  new  resized  SBSS-SCHEMA absolute and all updated elements to activate your new sizes. 3.10.2.1.  @FREEALL 3.10.2.2.  @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE. 3.10.3.  To  install  new  UDS  and  SBSS-SCHEMA,  process  the  @START  and  the  @ADD statements below.  Also DO NOT start this run if your DMC has a UDS dump or UDS reload scheduled.  It will not work.  This run will update the UDS (Universal Data System).  It will copy  the  SBSS-SCHEMA  into  your  DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.  file  and  copy  all  the new catalog statements into your 0GV0*DBRUN$. file. 3.10.3.1.  @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA              Note: Review the PR for errors.  Breakpoint file is 0GV0<ALN>*DELSBS.  Errors are OK here because the program may be trying to delete a file that does not exist.  Also, the breakpoint file  0GV0<ALN>*INSTALL.,  MUST  have  0-Fatal,  0-Errors  on  the  INSTALL  and EXPORT portion only.  If you have a warning, go to that line and determine if the warning was serious.  It will show you if that instruction was successful or not.  There are too many warnings to list.  Therefore, determine which type of warning it was.  REMARKS are okay.  Register the new SBSS-SCHEMA just resized via NGVU31 by processing the following: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 241 3.10.3.2.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR 3.10.4.  Review the catalog statements in  your 0GV0*DBRUN$. file for the particular gang you resized.  They must have the new sizes in the resized areas.  If the disk assignment options are  used,  you  must  ensure  the  correct  disk  assignments  are  there.    DO  NOT  CONTINUE UNTIL THIS STEP IS CORRECT! 3.11.  Post Sizing Procedures.  Now you are ready to upload the database.  This job will read the tape created by the DNLOADx program.  The upload may take anywhere between 2 and 6 hours to  complete  based  upon  the  size  of  your  database  and  system  saturation.    NGV052  will  be  the longest  running  upload  program  because  this  is  the  one  that  stores  all  the  item  details.    After upload,  be  sure  to  verify  your  database.    This  list  should  be  compared  with  the  one  before  the download.    As  stated  earlier,  there  will  be  some  records  not  reloaded.    Since  some  application programs may leave empty sets or orphan records on the system, they will not be uploaded.  Before starting  your  UPLOAD,  ensure  you  modify  your  new  catalog  (@CAT)  statements  in 0GV0*DBRUN$.  Process the following jobs to reload the database:             @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.L-LOAD/GV-x                         Note 1             @XQT DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                              Note 2             @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x                         Note 3             @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx                     Note 3             @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x                     Note 4             @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC             Note 5             Continue with normal processing                                           Note 6 Note: 1.  Breakpoint file is xGV0*LOADx.  x equals primary gang number.  This list will display totals for all records that were reloaded/stored. 2.  Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors. 3.  Verify/GV will display record totals from the uploads.  Breakpoint file is xGV0*VERGVx. (Where x = gang number).  Verify/CALC will display any CALC errors.  This will ensure all sets were properly linked.  Breakpoint file is xGV0*GVCALC. (Where x = gang number.) 4.  This is your starting IRU dump.  DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT LOAD ANY DUMPS PRIOR TO THIS DUMP or your database will be corrupt. 5.  This EXEC dump will save your SBSS environment for your particular ALN. 6.  If all prior runs were error free, continue with your scheduled process. 3.11.1.  For  the  ACCOMMODATE  option,  after  you  have  processed  the  runstream ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA, you have to use ACOPY to reload the incoming database. 3.12.  Resizing TXHIST-GV Area.  The transaction history area does not belong to any set and does not point outside itself.  The download and upload procedures are not required to resize this DMS area.  This section will cover the steps required to resize your TXHIST-GV area.  The storage method used for this area is DMS-CALC. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 242 3.12.1.  Presizing  Procedures.    Process  all  reports,  including  RPTEON  on  your  secondary gang.  Your secondary gang must be closed out: 3.12.1.1.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x  (x = secondary gang number) 3.12.1.2.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x  (x = secondary gang number) 3.12.2.  Process  all  reports,  including  RPTEON  on  your  primary  gang.    Your  primary  gang must  be  closed  out.    DMS-CALC  uses  the  input  901-STOCK-NUMBER  to  store  the  901 records, then processes the following jobs.  x equals primary gang number: 3.12.2.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x 3.12.2.2.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31 3.12.3.  Enter option 1.  NGVU31 will prompt for record counts.  TAB forward to the TXN-HIST field and enter the required number of transactions.  Leave all other fields on this screen blank.  Return to main menu and enter option 5.  This will list your track sizes for the TXHIST area.  If you entered the wrong counts, take option 1 and reinput your correct count.  When ready, continue. 3.12.3.1.  @FREEALL 3.12.3.2.  @ADD   0GV0*OUTFILE. 3.12.3.3.  @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA 3.12.3.4.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR 3.12.3.5.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC 3.12.3.6.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x 3.12.3.7.  @DELETE DMS$<ALN>*TXHIST-GV-x. 3.12.3.8.  @CAT,PV DMS$<ALN>*TXHIST-GV-x.,F/1/TRK/5,DA              Note:   The information required for the above @CAT statement can be obtained from your new CATx statement in file 0GV0*DBRUN$.  In the above example F = disk type; 1= minimum track size; 5 = maximum track size; and DA = disk assignment.  Modify your @CAT statement with the appropriate information.  Be sure to add your disk assignment, if used.  If you use @ASG instead of @CAT just change @CAT,PV to @ASG,UPV: 3.12.3.9.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.UP/GV-x 3.12.3.10.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DMU 3.12.3.11.

Continue with your normal processing or any local procedures. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 243 Section 3D—-CTH Database Maintenance 3.13.  Overview.  These procedures cover the implementation of CTH, the resizing of a new CTH database or an existing one.  In either case, there are a few steps that needs to be accomplished before resizing or establishing the CTH database. 3.13.1.  Preconversion Procedures.  First, let’s cover the procedures for initial implementation of CTH.  By now, everyone should be using CTH.  Before we actually load data to these areas, you must determine the  storage  area required based upon  a 13-month period.  Any  amount above this is by local discretion.  Remember, the more data you have, the longer run time for the RPTD37 (NGV783), DMU verifies and NDA500.  NGVU31 will be the processor used to build  the  DMS  areas  and  modify  the  existing  schema  for  the  new  sizes.    A  self-contained formula within NGVU31 helps you determine this.  The following job will start the resizing process: 3.13.1.1.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31 3.13.2.  Take option 2 for CTH only.  This will not affect any of the NGV areas.  CTH will be sized based upon projected transaction counts.  The formula will size the CT-HIST-GV and CT-OWNR-GV based upon your input number of records.  The CT-CTRL-GV area track sizes are released at a standard size.  If you have answered the formula wrong, just exit NGVU31 and restart the run. 3.13.2.1.  @FREEALL 3.13.2.2.  @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE. 3.13.3.  When ready to size, do the following.  Although you're only sizing the CTH areas, all GV users must be down.  This is because you will be deleting and restoring the internal UDS areas. 3.13.3.1.  @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA 3.13.3.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR 3.13.3.3.  INITIALIZE CTH DATABASE AREAS. 3.13.3.4.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.CTHx (x = CTH gang number) 3.14.  Upload and Establish CTH Histories.  Prepare the Consolidated Transaction History area for loading by processing NGV225 (Create Consolidated Transaction History Control Record).  The  program  will  prompt  for  the  input  GANG  and  NUMBER  OF  DATA  PAGES  required  to establish the area.  Enter the Primary gang number at the first prompt (must be 1 - 4).  Next, enter the number of data pages, and be sure to follow the provided sizing formula.  To process NGV225, enter the following command: 3.14.1.  @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R 3.14.2.  #            (Enter primary gang number) 3.14.3.  Y           (Enter Y since you have sizes from  NGVU31 or N if you don't) 3.14.4.  #            (Enter primary gang) AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 244 3.14.5.  XXXXXX         (Enter # of pages from NGVU31.  The # of pages must be entered with                                        leading zeros.  For instance, if the count is 50000, then enter 050000.) 3.15.  Overview  UTL043  (NGV043).  This  is  an  example  of  how  to  use  UTL043.    Process UTL043  (NGV043)  to  establish  the  Consolidated  Transaction  History  areas  by  using  UTL041 tapes.  Research must be accomplished to determine the number of months to be loaded, based upon  the  available  disk  storage  from  your  DBM.    Tapes  must  be  loaded  in  transaction  date sequence  with  the  oldest  date  loaded  first.    If  you  have  missing  dates  in  the  Consolidated Transaction History area, (and those dates have actual transactions), then the integrity of the CTH area is compromised.  If dates are missing, the Consolidated Transaction History is invalid. 3.15.1.  You have to take into account the amount of time it takes to upload these histories.  An average time for an upload is approximately 2 to 16 hours per 100,000 transactions.  Your time will  depend  upon  your  configuration  and  system  workload  during  the  upload  process.    To ensure time is not wasted on trying to upload a bad tape, it's highly recommended that a few days prior to the upload process the M19 (NGV777) against the UTL041 tapes. 3.15.2.  There are two load options for UTL043. 3.15.2.1.  Load all histories during one end-of-day processing. 3.15.2.2.  Load all histories on more than one end-of-day processing. 3.15.3.  Here  are  the  steps  used  for  uploading  the  CT-HISTORIES  using  the  UTL043 (NGV043). 3.15.3.1.  After processing the RPTRUN crossover, you will need to process NGV299 and set the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED to a 1 on the secondary database.  Process NGV225 as explained  above.    NGV225  will  only  be  processed  one  time,  as  it  stores  the  711-CT-HISTORY  and  710-CT-SUPPORT  records.    The  processing  of  NGV299  to  change  the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED will have to be processed each day on the secondary database if your upload is spread out over more than one end of day processing.  After processing NGV299/NGV225, start the first UTL043 to upload your first month’s histories.  You can process your regular EOD schedule, but remember any add-on reports will slow down the upload process.  Your online processing time should not be compromised.  If you want to upload using UTL043 and not spread it over more than one EOD, do not process RPTRUN crossover or RPTEON while UTL043 is processing. 3.15.4.  Once all UTL043’s have completed you will need to process NGV299 and change the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED to a 1 on the primary database.  This will let RPTRUN crossover automatically dump the CTH areas and process the D37.  Here are two final Helpful hints.  It would be wise, and it's highly recommended that a dump of the CTH areas be taken after each successful UTL043 upload.  Also, on the RPTRUN select image, do not take the bypass option (B in cc-79) in the event that a CTH recovery is required.  This can be waivered by MAJCOM.  After you are through with your complete upload, you will also need to process the UTL042 to show what transaction dates have been loaded. 3.15.4.1.  Process NDA500.  A option on the Primary. 3.15.4.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CTHx AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 245 3.15.4.3.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALC-CTHx 3.15.4.4.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx 3.15.4.5.  Ensure your base constants has the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag set to a 1.  Process either NGV068A or NGV299 to complete this step. 3.16.  CTH DMS Areas.  The CTH database is comprised of three areas located on the primary gang only.  They are the CT-HIST-GV, CT-OWNR-GV and the CT-CTRL-GV areas. 3.16.1.  The  CT-HISTORY  area  contains  the  711  CT-HISTORY-CONTROL  and  704  CT-HISTORY records.  The 704 records are the 901 records that are printable transactions.  The 711 record controls the whole CTH operation.  This record is created and stored by program NGV225.  The 711 is a direct record and is always stored at the following location: 3.16.1.1.  AREA = CT-HIST-GV-x 3.16.1.2.  PAGE = 1 3.16.1.3.  REC  = 1 3.16.2.  This record contains the following information to control the CTH environment.  711-NUMBER-OF-PAGES:    This  will  equal  the  total  number  of  tracks  the  CT-HIST  area  is currently sized for.  It must equal the number of tracks shown on the Schema for the CT-HIST-GV-X area.  The next field, 711-RECORDS-PER-PAGE:  This will ALWAYS equal 20.  Each page within the CT-HIST-GV-X area will hold 20, 704 records except page 1 which contains only the 711 CT-CONTROL-RECORD.  To compute the number of histories (704) you can store, use the following formula as an example:             711-NUMBER-OF-PAGES * 711-RECORDS-PER-PAGE - 20                                       |                                                  |                   |                                 (25000             *                             20 )            - 20  =  499,980 3.16.2.1.  711-NEXT-PAGE-NUMBER:  tells the D37 (NGV778) at which page number to write the next 704 record. 3.16.2.2.  711-NEXT-RECORD-NUMBER:    tells  the  D37  (NGV778)  at  which  record number or page slot to write the next 704 record. 3.16.2.3.  711-PURGE-DATE:  this is the date of the oldest record stored within the CT-HIST area.  UTL041 checks this field prior to deleting the 704 records. 3.16.2.4.  711-SUMMARY-INDEX:  Unused. 3.16.2.5.  711-TRANSACTION-SUMMARY: 3.16.2.6.  711-TRANSACTION-DATE  =  Ordinal  date  the  D37  was  processed  on.    The oldest date is first. 3.16.2.7.  711-TRANSACTION-COUNT = Number of transactions loaded for that day. 3.16.3.  The CT-CTRL area is the area that Document Control works with and should have the responsibility to keep organized.  This area contains the following records:               706-CT-DELINQUENT-SOURCE AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 246               * 707-CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL               708-CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC               709-CT-DELINQUENT-OPR               * 710-CT-SUPPORT Note:      * equals the only records you will need to work with.  All other records are created by TIP inputs and by Document Control personnel. 3.16.3.1.  This area is sized at 450 prime and 573 overflow (450/1023).  It is released by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity at this size and must not be changed.  It will  hold  a  maximum  of  32,000  to  35,000,  707  CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL  records.  The 710 CT-SUPPORT is used by the DEL DOC list R59 and D37.  This is a direct record (page 1, record 1) and is used by the D37 to write restart points to.  There is no restart for the D37, but this record must be stored in order for the D37 to process.  When storing with NGV299, the record needs no data stored in the fields of the 710.  Always store a blank record.    Do  not  modify  any  fields.    The  707  CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL  records  are DCC images either loaded automatically by the D37 or manually by NGV330.  This record is used to create DCC images when download/upload of DCC images are required.  The 707 date is five positions but the DCC format is four positions.  You will need to modify these images PRIOR to loading them via program NGV330. 3.16.4.  The CT-OWNR area contains the owner records for the CT-HIST area. 3.16.5.  D37 Run Logic.  Ensure RPTRUN (NGV898C) has processed a CTH dump, then start the  D37  process  for  the  daily  updates.    The  D37  writes  the  daily  901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY  records  to  the  704-HISTORY  records  and  creates  the  707  records.    In  order  to process the D37, NGV898C will check to see if the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag is set to a 1.  If it is, the D37 procedures will proceed, then the CTH areas are dumped to tape IAW Ch 2, for CTH dumps. This dump is mandatory.  Since the area is so large, "QUICK-LOOKS" are turned off and prohibits ROLLBACK in  the event  of an error.   If  LOOKS were left  on, all images would be written to AUDIT-TRAIL and a lot of valuable computer time would be lost.  That is why if you are working errors with either the D37, UTL043 or any other CTH program, ALWAYS recover the CTH database first.  Remember to turn LOOKS back on by processing 0GV0*DBRUN$.LOOKSON/CTH1 before any recovery. 3.16.6.  DMS$<ALN>*RECOVERYOFF.    This  file  is  a  DMS  file  required  to  be  assigned anytime LOOKS are turned off.  If it is not assigned or cataloged just catalog this file in public mode as follows:  @CAT,PV DMS$<ALN>*RECOVERYOFF. 3.16.7.  Common errors with D37 and UTL043.  Due to system errors and operator interface, you may receive from time to time, the following errors.  Not all errors are listed due to the situation, but the most frequent will be explained. 3.16.7.1.  799/12/05/00  -  DUPES  NOT  ALLOWED  -  You  have  more  than  one  901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY that has the same transaction number.  704 records are stored by transaction number.  Since the schema states DUPES NOT ALLOWED in this DMS-EXEC area, that is why you encounter this error.  Function number 12 is a store function in COBOL. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 247 3.16.7.1.1.  TO CORRECT:  Reload the CTH area, identify the dupe 901, change the 901-TRANSACTION-NBR to a number that is not in use. 3.16.7.2.  799/12/91/84  - All  associated overflow pages have been utilized or maximum storage  has  been  reached.    The  UDS  (Universal  Data  System)  or  DMS-EXEC  area  has reached its maximum storage capability. 3.16.7.2.1.  TO CORRECT:  Reload the CTH area, run VERIFY/CTHx and identify which area is full.  Check the CT-CTRL area first.  If it is the CT-HIST or the CT-OWNR area, UTL041 must be processed to free up disk space.  If it is the CT-CTRL area,  process  NGV330  and  have  Document  Control  delete  invalid  images,  DMU initialize the CTRL area, use NGV299 to store the 710 record, and process NGV330 to upload the edited file. 3.16.7.3.  799/07/12/161  -  Not  enough  disk  space.    This  error  will  be  more  than  likely received by those bases that use removable packs.  The way to check this is a @PRT,D REM01/FMD  (example of  pack-ID  and  equipment  type).    Contact  your  DMC  for  more disk space.  Refer to the DMU example that was discussed earlier. 3.17.  Recovery of the CTH Database. 3.17.1.  General.  There are many ways to recover the CTH area.  Since the CT-HIST area is made  up  of  direct  records  you  can  recover  this  area  in  a  number  of  different  ways.    Just remember, you can NEVER use AUDIT-TRAIL tapes.  Since LOOKS and RECOVERYOFF options are utilized, nothing from CTH is ever written to AUDIT-TRAIL.  Be sure that any time you use your secondary gang to reload 901 records, ALWAYS, REPEAT ALWAYS, dump the secondary gang prior to reloading any dump. 3.17.2.  RPTEON on the secondary will cross over numerous records and if you have an old dump  loaded,  that  data  gets  crossed  over  to  the  primary.    That  is  why  you  always  process RPTEON on the secondary prior to a recovery and do not process RPTEON again until the next processing day (crossover) has been accomplished.  There are too many conditions to list that might require a recovery but the following are the most frequent: 3.17.2.1.  ERROR:    Disk  crash,  last  good  dump  was  3  days  PRIOR.    First,  process RPTEON on the secondary if not already done.  Next, reload last good CTH dump.  Reload the crossover dump for the particular day’s transaction date you need to recover.  Process the D37.  Reload the next day’s crossover dump.  Process the D37.  Repeat these steps until current.    Process  the  R60.    Remember,  DO  NOT  PROCESS  RPTEON  ON  THE SECONDARY. 3.17.2.2.  ERROR:  Monday's CTH histories are valid, Tuesday's are invalid, Wednesday's are valid, Thursday’s are valid, and today is Friday.  Use the same recovery procedures as contained in the “ERROR:” paragraph above to recover the CTH data. 3.18.  Processing D37 (NGV778) With Multiple Crossovers. 3.18.1.  There may be times when maintenance of the CTH database may not be required to process the D37 for several days.  This can be done, but it will require close coordination and system  processing  time.    The  following  is  recommended  to  reload  each  day’s  transaction histories.  These transaction histories will be loaded from the RPTRUN (crossover) dump. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 248 3.18.1.1.  Complete all reports on the secondary database. 3.18.1.2.  Process RPTEON on the secondary database. 3.18.1.3.  Dump the secondary database. 3.18.1.4.  Save and modify an existing IRU runstream with the following ECL commands.  Process this IRU Reload for the first day of transactions to reload. 3.18.1.4.1.  @RUN,A RELOAD,,xGV0 3.18.1.4.2.  @SYM   PRINT$.,,RPS08 3.18.1.4.3.  @ASG,T APPL01*IRU$HF. 3.18.1.4.4.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x 3.18.1.4.5.  @IRU 3.18.1.4.6.  RELOAD FILE DMS$<ALN>*TXHIST-GV-x 3.18.1.4.7.  FROM REEL ??????; 3.18.1.4.8.  ACT; END; 3.18.1.4.9.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.UP/GV-x 3.18.1.4.10.  @FIN                        Note:     Replace ?????? with the reel number of the RPTRUN dump tape.  For multiple reels you only need the first tape number.  x equals secondary gang number. 3.18.1.5.  Change the following fields to equal the date of the transaction histories loaded from the  previous  paragraph  002-ORDINAL-DATE,  002-JULIAN-DATE,  002-CALENDAR-DATE. 3.18.1.6.  Process the D37. 3.18.1.7.  Repeat  the  IRU Reload instructions above until  all days have been recovered.  See the note above; remember to change the ?????? each time to the applicable reel number. 3.18.1.8.  Dump the CTH database: 3.18.1.8.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx 3.18.1.9.  Once  the  last  D37  has  processed,  down  and  delete  the  secondary  database.    x equals the secondary gang number.  RPTEON  has already updated the primary.  These two steps will prevent an erroneous update of the primary database. 3.18.1.9.1.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-x 3.18.1.9.2.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-x 3.18.1.10.  Process UTL042, if desired, to list the days and transaction counts of your CTH database. 3.18.1.11.  Resume normal processing. 3.19.  Processing UTL043 (NGV043) With Multiple Crossovers. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 249 3.19.1.  There may be times when reprocessing of UTL043 cannot be completed in an end-of-day due to the number of transactions on your system or recoveries.  These procedures cover the steps necessary to resize your CTH areas in the event that the download and upload will cover more than one end of day reports.  As with resizing GV, ensure that these procedures are discussed ahead of time with all users. 3.19.2.  Process  your normal end of day crossover.  Ensure  your DMC does not scratch the tapes for the days that are to be loaded.  You must ensure all steps are clear before and after reloading  the  CTH  database.    You  can  either  start  your  upload  after  end  of  day  reports  or whenever you want.  We suggest the following; leave the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED flag to equal a " " (space), process RPTRUN (crossover) on the primary, and process UTL043 while the  dailies  are  processing.    Again,  this  is  a  suggestion  and  may  be  processed  as  locally determined. 3.19.3.  In any case, process an IRUDUMP after each successful UTL043.  Each tape may take anywhere  from  2  to  16  hours  to  process,  depending  upon  the  number  of  transactions  and number of days you are loading. 3.19.4.  Process UTL042 to list out the dates and number of transactions loaded for your days reloaded.  After all reloads have been completed, unless local procedures exist, the users may now query the CTH database. 3.20.  Resizing  Existing  CTH  Database.  These  steps  will  be  used  to  resize  an  existing  CTH database.  You should keep at least 13 months of data on your CTH database.  However, this may change from one system to another based upon the disk area available and workload.  Before any resize,  notify  all  users  that  all  CTH  processing  must  cease  until  after  the  resizing  has  been completed.  The only time the ADS for GV has to be down is for the runstream ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA.  Once this has been completed, all users can continue processing with the exception of CTH.  Before you start to resize your CTH area consider the average time to download, resize, and upload 13 months’ worth of CT-HISTORY records. 3.20.1.  Before any resize, save your SBSS executive environment and CTH database: 3.20.1.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/ALN-EXEC 3.20.1.2.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx 3.20.2.  Next, you must download existing CTH records using UTL041.  Process UTL041 with a B in position 54.  This option bypasses deleting the records as they are being downloaded.  Since these areas will be initialized later, this will save a lot of processing time.  (See Ch 2, for UTL041.)  After processing UTL041 to download all CTH records, continue with the CTH resizing.    Process  NGV330  download  option  to  save  your  707  records  that  have  not  been cleared by Document Control.  Turn CTH off by setting the 002-ATH-IMPLEMENTED to equal a " " (space) on the primary.  Do not set it back to a 1 until all recoveries are completed and you start processing the D37. 3.20.2.1.  Size your new schema:  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31 3.20.3.  Enter  option  2  for  CTH.    Next,  NGVU31  will  prompt  for  the  number  of  704-TRANSACTION-HISTORY records to be stored.  Again, using the formula displayed, enter this number.  When you return to the main menu of NGVU31, use the L option to list the new AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 250 sized  CT-HISTORY  area.    Ensure  primary  database  is  offline  and  no  users  can  access  the database.  Start the resize process: 3.20.3.1.  @ADD   0GV0*OUTFILE. 3.20.3.2.  @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA 3.20.3.3.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR 3.20.3.4.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.CTH1 3.20.3.5.  @ADD,L  GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R          Note:      NGV225  will prompt for gang number and number of CT-HISTORY tracks.  This run will build the 711-CT-HISTORY-CONTROL  and  710-CT-SUPPORT  records.    The  711-CT-HISTORY-CONTROL resides in the CT-HISTORY area at page 1, record 1.  This is the only record on this page.  The 710-CT-SUPPORT resides in the CT-CTRL-GV-1 area at page 1, record 1, and will not be the only record stored on this page.  This is a CTS subroutine that will prompt  you  for  the  correct  answers.    The  response  for  number  of  tracks  must  be  six positions.  Once NGV225 completes continue, start the upload process. 3.20.4.  Process UTL043 to upload your CTH records downloaded from UTL041 tapes in this section.  (See Ch 2 for the UTL043 instructions.)  This may take anywhere from 2 to 16 hours per month.  These tapes must be reloaded in  transaction date sequence with  the oldest date loaded first.  DO NOT SKIP any dates or your CTH database will become an invalid audit trial.  If the upload extends past your end of day processing and crossover is required, follow the steps in the paragraph on Processing UTL043 (NGV043) With Multiple Crossovers, in this section.  If the upload does not extend past your end of day, continue on with the following step: 3.20.5.  Process UTL042.  This report will verify the CTH database, list the transaction dates and number of transactions for the days on the select card.  UTL042 is used as a verification list to ensure the correct number of transactions are loaded for the dates selected. 3.21.  Examples of CTH Recoveries.  There are many ways to recover the CTH area.  Since the CT-HIST area is made up of direct records you can recover this area in a number of different ways.  Just remember, you can NEVER use AUDIT-TRAIL tapes.  Since LOOKS and RECOVERYOFF options are utilized, nothing from CTH is ever written to AUDIT-TRAIL.  Be sure that anytime you  use  your  Secondary  gang  to  reload  901  records,  ALWAYS,  REPEAT  ALWAYS,  dump  it PRIOR to reloading anything.  Remember, RPTEON on the secondary will cross over numerous records and if you have an old dump loaded, that's what gets crossed over.  The following are a few examples only.  There are too many conditions to list that might require a recovery. 3.21.1.  ERROR 1:  Disk crash, last good dump was 3 days prior.  First, dump the secondary database and process RPTEON on the secondary after all reports have completed.  Next, reload the  only  transaction  histories  from  the  first  crossover  dump.    After  loading  the  transaction histories, change the 002-ORDINAL-DATE, 002-JULIAN-DATE and the 002-CALENDAR-DATE to equal the date of these histories.  Process the D37 and repeat these steps with each RPTRUN  on  the  primary.    When  completed,  DO  NOT,  REPEAT,  DO  NOT  PROCESS RPTEON ON THE SECONDARY GANG. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 251 3.21.2.  ERROR 2:  Monday's histories are valid, Tuesday's are invalid, Wednesday's are valid, Thursday’s are valid and today is Friday.  Use the procedures from paragraph above to recover the CTH areas. 3.21.3.  ERROR 3.  Using the same two examples in section above, you may also recover the CTH database using the following steps: 3.21.3.1.  Process all secondary reports. 3.21.3.2.  IRU dump the secondary. 3.21.3.3.  Process secondary RPTEON. 3.21.3.4.  Reload Monday’s CTH dump to the primary. 3.21.3.5.  Reload the transaction histories (901) from the RPTRUN dump taken Monday to the secondary database. 3.21.3.6.  Change  002-ORDINAL-DATE,  002-JULIAN-DATE  and  002-CALENDAR-DATE to reflect the transaction history date (MONDAY).  Change 002-FLAG-S to a 1, if RPTEON has already been processed. 3.21.3.7.  Process D37. 3.21.3.8.  Repeat reloading the transaction histories, changing the dates and processing the D37 for each day until current. 3.21.3.9.  Process the R60 to update the CTRL area. 3.21.3.10.  IRU dump the CTH database when completed. 3.21.3.11.  Down  and  delete  the  secondary.    DO  NOT,  REPEAT,  DO  NOT  process RPTEON on the secondary. 3.21.3.11.1.  EXAMPLE 1:  Recovering The Consolidated Transaction History (CTH) Areas 3.21.3.12.  798  REJECT.    This  is  usually  caused  by  Batch  Production  Scheduler  (BPS) cleanup deleting the BPS file so the program cannot go to a good end of job. 3.21.3.12.1.  Process UTL042 for the date you are processing on. 3.21.3.12.2.  Validate total transactions with the SORT count from the D37.  This was displayed  on  your  console  typeout.    If  the  totals  on  UTL042  match  the  number  of transactions sorted, then no recovery is required. 3.21.3.12.3.  Resume normal EOD processing. 3.21.3.12.4.  If the count does not match, you will have to reload the CTH dump taken prior to the D37 and then reprocess the D37. 3.21.3.12.4.1.  EXAMPLE 2:  Download and Upload Of CTRL-GV-1 Area 3.21.3.13.  RPTR59 (NGV781) is unmanageable; that is 300 or more pages.  When  you process the R59 and there are no records selected, based upon input or the DCC images being sent back to the main frame 2200 not clearing, you may need to download/upload the CTRL-GV-1 area. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 252 3.21.3.13.1.  DMU  VERIFY  of  the  CT-CTRL-GV-x  area  shows  the  number  of overflow pages as being 400 or more.  There are only a maximum of 577.  Subtract prime pages from overflow pages. 3.21.3.13.2.  Use  the  following  to  download  and  upload  your  DCC  images.

One of the most important functions of maintaining the DMS databases are the Unisys Repository  Manager  (UREP).    UREP  is  part  of  the  overall  Universal  Data  System  (UDS).  SBSS will be our main concern in this UDS review.  The SBSS utilizes the Repository and the File Description Table (FDT) for storage/definition of all the DMS areas.  Always coordinate with the SBLC/RPC when you do an IMPORT or INSTALL.  If a UDS-DUMP or UDS-LOAD AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 253 is in progress, the IMPORT or INSTALL will not work.  Also, if this is done after hours, see if the DMC will wait until after the IMPORT/INSTALL to run the UDS dump. 3.22.2.  Example of Repository and File Description Tables:              /              \             __________       __________             /   Repository   \           |ITMDTL-GV |     |DOCNBR-GV |             |                |           |  [FDT]   |     |  [FDT]   |             | ITMDTL-GV      |          >|__________|    -|__________|             | DOCNBR-GV      |                |                |                  | REPCYC-GV      |            ____|_____       ____|_____             | PRTNBR-GV      |           |REPCYC-GV |     |PRTNBR-GV |             | etc......      |           |  [FDT]   |     |  [FDT]   |             \ 249 areas SBSS /<          |__________|    -|__________|              \______________/ 3.22.3.  In  the  above  example,  the  Repository  contains  descriptions  of  all  249  areas  of  the SBSS database.  You MUST have a corresponding FDT for each description in the database.  You  always  create  the  Repository  then  build  each  FDT  by  using  the  CREATE/INSTALL commands in  the  IMPORT or  INSTALL  runstreams.   Next,  each runstream  is  explained to illustrate the relationship of the Repository and FDT. 3.23.  Import/Delete/Report Definition. 3.23.1.  IMPORT.  This command builds the internal database called the UDS (Universal Data System).  These  are tables which define  external DMS-EXEC  database  areas.   They define certain  attributes  about  these  areas  such  as  locking  strategy,  assignment  configuration,  area sizes and so on.  Without a valid UDS, the external database could never be operational.  The DD  (Data  Dictionary)  processor  is  used  to  update  or  delete  the  UDS.    Anytime  a  resize  is accomplished, the UDS as well as the DMS areas must be updated.  The application (APPL01) for instance, checks the UDS prior to the DMS-EXEC areas.  If it's corrupt, a DMS 1100 error will occur.  The three most common options we use through the DD processor is Delete, Install, and Report. 3.23.2.  DELETE OPTION.  First, look at the Delete option.  The main purpose of the delete option is to remove all FDT (File Description Tables) from the UDS.  There must be a FDT for every DMS-EXEC area in your database.  The example shows the relationships of the FDT and Repository.  You may have to delete and reinstall these areas after a system crash, 413-boot, and the delete is mandatory after a database resize.  You always delete the FDT first, then the repository.  The following two examples show the difference:  (1) PROCESS STORAGE-AREA ITMDTL-GV-1 VERSION ALL FOR SCHEMA SBSS9005EMA DELETE, and, (2)  DELETE  STORAGE-AREA ITMDTL-GV-1  VERSION  ALL  FOR  SCHEMA SBSS9005EMA.  In the first example, the PROCESS is placed in front and the DELETE verb is  at  the end of the command.  This  tells the DD processor to  delete the FDT.  The second example shows the DELETE in front of the command.  This tells the DD dictionary to delete AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 254 the Repository.  Remember, you must delete the FDT first, then the Repository or a DD error will occur. 3.23.3.  REPORT OPTION.  This option reads the UDS database and displays the attributes for  each  DMS-EXEC  area.    The  following  example  shows  the  Report  option  for DMS$<ALN>*ITMDTL-GV-1: 3.23.3.1.  @DD,DE 3.23.3.2.

END UREP (0) FATALS (0) ERRORS (0) WARNINGS (2 REMARKS). 3.23.4.  As you can see, the FDT describes all attributes of DMS-EXEC areas.  The two fields most  frequently  changed  by  DBRUN$  ECL  runstreams  are  the  RECOVERY  and MAXIMUM-PAGES fields.  The RECOVERY is changed to AUDITED FALSE whenever LOOKSOFF/GV-x  is  processed  from  your  DBRUN$  file.    This  is  used  by  the  RPTD37 (NGV778) to turn after-looks off.  AFTER-LOOKS are the updated database pages normally written to audit trail.  Since the D37 has so many updates and IRU dumps are taken after the AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 255 report has been processed, it would be a waste of system resources to write all updated pages to the audit trail tape and then process an IRU dump. 3.23.5.  The only difference between the Import and Install runstreams in your DBRUN$ file is simply the name.  Both elements INSTALL the UDS areas.  However, the IMPORT is used for  any  UDS file runstream  uses 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA. which was updated by NGVU31, the SBSS resizing processor. rebuild  except  NGVU31. INSTALL   The 3.24.  Export Definition. 3.24.1.  EXPORT.  The Export process saves the descriptions after the UDS areas have been installed.  The Export reads the UDS areas and writes this data to a file or element.  The SBSS uses  the  runstream  0GV0*DBRUN$.EXPORT/ALL-SBSS  to  build  this  element.    Once  the updates  have  been  applied  to  the  UDS,  an  @START  of  this  runstream  builds  the  element EXPORT/SBSS-SCHEMA in your DBRUN$ file.  The following command exports the UDS areas: 3.24.1.1.  EXPORT  STORAGE-AREA  ALL  VERSION  ALL  FOR  SCHEMA SBSS9005EMA 3.24.2.

Overview.  Various  processes  exist  on  the  SBLC  to  verify  the  validity  of  the  database.  These include checks for valid pages (tracks) and valid linkage between associated sets.  No DMS utility will verify that the data on these pages are correct.  Its purpose is to verify that the database is  structurally intact.    If  any  errors appear at  any time  you must take  your database offline and determine the cause of these errors.  At no time should you remain inline if a database error is discovered. 3.25.1.  SBSS  application  program  NGV024,  Item  and  Repair  Cycle  Record  Link  Check Program, must be used to verify the integrity of item and repair cycle records. 3.25.2.  Data  Management  Utility  (DMU).    DMS  1100  Data  Management  Utility  (DMU) processes must be used to verify the integrity of the database. 3.25.2.1.  0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x.  This runstream ensures that records located within an area are authorized, as identified by the schema, to reside within the area.  It also provides certain sizing data which will be used by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity personnel to determine if resizing of the database is necessary.  Recommended limits are:  optimum is 65 percent and maximum is 75 to 80 percent.  If an area exceeds 80 percent,  notify  the  MAJCOM  and  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  for resizing verification.  This must be processed at least weekly. 3.25.2.2.  NDA500.    This  program  verifies  all  sets  identified  by  the  schema.    It  ensures each member of the set is linked to another member in the set or to its owner record.  If a set is empty, it verifies the fact that the owner's next pointer is pointing to itself.  If a record AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 256 has a pointer, other than pointing to itself, the record at the location being pointed to, must be a record authorized to be in the particular set.  If a record's next owner, or prior pointer does not point to a record authorized within the set, an error file is produced.  NDA500 is mandatory on the secondary database daily, immediately after RPTRUN on the primary and prior to any reports on the secondary gang.  It is also NDA500 mandatory weekly on the primary database using the A (all) option. 3.25.2.3.  0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALCx.    Performs  verification  of  CALC  chains.  Recommend running bimonthly or whenever pointer errors are suspected.  NDA500 will not show CALC errors.  Verify/CALC is the only verification program to identify CALC errors. 3.26.  Errors.  When  appropriate,  all  errors  are  printed  on  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity console and/or AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity printer.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity supervisor should review the error printouts and ensure corrective action is taken.  Corrective action is unique for each situation.  Any errors from the Verify/GV-x, Verify/CALCx, or NDA500 produced on the primary database must be corrected as soon as possible in order to maintain database integrity.  This would include taking the primary database offline, correcting the error or errors, dumping the database and then resuming normal processing.  Under no circumstances must an SBSS account be online if errors are discovered or suspected. Section 3G—-Forced Record Alteration (NGV299) 3.27.  Overview.  Occasionally,  there  will  be  conditions  created  on  a  database  that  cannot  be corrected  by  processing  normal  transactions.    When  these  conditions  exist  the  records  must  be altered or deleted.  However, there are conditions where record alterations should never be used; this includes NGV299, QLP with update, and DBE.  Use of QLP with update and DBE (Database Editor)  is  authorized  by  the  MAJCOM  or  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity ONLY.  It is mandatory that all ERRORS should be corrected by processing a normal input or a series  of  inputs,  such  as  file  maintenance,  reverse-post,  or  inventory  adjustments  in  lieu  of NGV299. 3.28.  Processing  of  Program  NGV299.  This  program  will  permit  alteration  or  deletion  of records  on  the  database.    The  execution  of  this  program  is  restricted  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R Information Technology Activity (function 057) and should only be executed by personnel who are familiar with database management system commands and the structure of the database.  Para 3.54  lists  the  commands  authorized  for  execution  by  program  NGV299.    Para  3.55  provides examples to execute several of the commands.  The program is gang oriented.  Once the execution phase has started and a gang number has been entered, it cannot be changed.  To enter a different gang number, terminate execution of the current run and reexecute the run unit using the desired gang number.  When executing this program, it is essential to ensure that currency of the record being modified is established prior to the modification.  One word of caution; do not try to alter, modify, or delete records while online because you may cause database pointer errors.  NDA500 must be processed after NGV299 has completed processing. 3.29.  Documentation.  For accounts not aligned under the Air Force Sustainment Center (AFSC) construct, a document reflecting both the BEFORE and AFTER image is printed for each record altered or deleted. All copies of the document will be annotated with an explanation of why an AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 257 alteration was made. The document must also indicate if A&F and satellites or other type stock record  account  records  were  affected.  The  host  LRS  Commander/AO  or  AFMC  Computer Operations designated representatives will sign the statement. The original copy of the document will  be  filed  in  Document  Control,  host/SD  01  site,  marked  as  FORCED  RECORD ALTERATIONS (FIX). A copy of the document will be forwarded to A&F and satellite or other type stock record account if the alteration affected their records. For accounts aligned under the AFSC,  a  document  reflecting  both  the  BEFORE  and  AFTER  image  is  posted  to  the  AFMC Computer Operations Forced Record Alteration (FIX) database for each record altered or deleted. The  document  will  be  annotated  with  an  explanation  of  why  an  alteration  was  made  and  will indicate if A&F or other type stock record account records were affected. Supported LRS/satellite Document  Control  Sections  and/or  A&F  will  retrieve  the  FIX  documentation  from  the  AFMC Computer Operations FIX database. 3.30.  Control  Number.  Each  document  produced  by  a  record  being  changed  or  deleted  is assigned a serial number under program control.  The serial number consists of a 4-digit Julian date and a 4-position serial number.  The serial number portion of the control number is stored in the inventory adjustment record and is updated each time a document is produced.  The latest serial number will be printed on the monthly Consolidated  Inventory Adjustment  Document Register (M10/NGV836) allowing Document Control to account for record alterations.  The serial number will be reset to zero on the record at year's end when the end-of-year option of the Prep Inventory Accuracy Records Program (A02/NGV838) is exercised.  If a previous database is recovered and a FIX has to be processed, annotate the FIX output with MEMO FOR RECORD.  Explain in the memo the reason for the FIX, indicating the FIX was processed on a previous database.  The M10 will not show these FIX numbers. 3.31.  Reconstructing Destroyed Records.  If a complete record is lost and must be reconstructed on the database, use the applicable inputs to reestablish the record.  For example, if an item record is  lost,  use  a  FIL  input  to  reload  the  record;  use  an  inventory  adjustment  input  to  establish  the serviceable balance (if applicable) and execute NGV299 to enter applicable data in other fields that cannot be entered with normal inputs. 3.32.  Instructions For FIXPUTFILE and FIXRECFILE. 3.32.1.  Program NGV299 uses two files that are created from the current source schema.  The files  are  0GV00000*FIXRECFILE.  and  0GV0<ALN>*FIXPUTFILE.    These  files  contain tables used to describe records, data names, and sets from the schema.  When a change is made to the schema these two files must be re-created at all bases. 3.32.2.  To  create  the  new  files,  the  new  schema  must  be  loaded,  then  execute  program NGV299 with the following command: 3.32.2.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/FIXREC 3.32.3.  The  above  job  will  delete  and  recatalog  the  0GV00000*FIXRECFILE.  and 0GV0<ALN>*FIXPUTFILE.  for  the  input  ALN.    On  stacked  systems,  ensure  that  you coordinate with all ALNs prior to processing CREATE/FIXREC. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 258 Section 3H—-Automated Pointer Correction Program (NDA500) 3.33.  Overview.  Occasionally database set errors will occur.  The main causes of database set errors are improper recoveries, system crashes and disk problems.  At no time should this program be processed to correct set errors without thoroughly researching the possible cause of the errors.  This program should not be utilized to circumvent normal SBSS recovery techniques; for example, audit trail recovery, supply transaction recovery (STR), or the combination of both.  Even though the program will make a database structurally correct, accountability is not guaranteed.  Records are  linked  within  sets  by  pointers.    There  are  three  types  of  pointers  utilized:    next,  prior,  and owner.    However,  not  all  records  contain  all  three  types  of  pointers.    NDA500  is  a  pointer correction program whose OPR is system code DA. 3.34.  Frequency of Processing NDA500. 3.34.1.  This program must be processed: 3.34.1.1.  Any time database pointer errors are suspected; that is, 799 rejects with an error number of 92. 3.34.1.2.  After  the  completion  of  all  audit  trail  tape  and  STR  (Supply  Transaction Recovery) recoveries. 3.34.1.3.  Daily  on  the  secondary  database  after  RPTRUN  (crossover)  and  prior  to  any reports processing. 3.34.1.4.  After any system crash or reboot. 3.34.2.  During  the  processing  of  NDA500,  other  SBSS  programs  may  continue  processing and  apply  updates  which  can  cause  erroneous  pointer  errors  to  be  identified.    Therefore,  if NDA500 is processed with other SBSS programs running, sets identified in error should be reverified. 3.35.  Program Logic. 3.35.1.  Execution  of  NDA500.    NDA500  is  started  by  entering  the  following  execute statement  from  any  demand  terminal:    @XQT  DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500.    Screen NDA500  1R1  will  be  displayed.    After  the  required  data  has  been  entered,  the  operator depresses  transmit,  and  the  program  will  build  the  summary  file  (see  Para.    3.58.).    If  an attempt is made to review the summary file during the build process, the program will produce a File FAC Status of 400010000000. 3.35.2.  NDA500 Functions.  After the summary file has been built, the program will begin a batch  run.    This  operation  consists  of  two  phases:    database  scan  and  verify.    During  the database scan phase, the program scans the database and selects all records that reside in the specified type set; for example, all records that belong in the ISG-Item record set are selected.  Set integrity is maintained for the verify phase.  During the verify phase, the program continues through the set from the owner by the set's next pointer and performs the following edits: 3.35.2.1.  Does the member belong in the set? 3.35.2.2.  Do the member records have the correct owner pointer, if applicable? 3.35.2.3.  Does the member records prior pointer equal that of the previous record in the set, if applicable? AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 259 3.35.2.4.  Does the next pointer point to a record in use? 3.35.2.5.  Does the next pointer point into an authorized area when records are authorized to cross areas? 3.35.3.  NDA500 Output.  After the batch run has been completed, the user should print the summary file.  This listing will be maintained for 90 days, and it is to be used for comparison during any recoveries. 3.35.4.  Errors.  If errors are encountered during the run, all processing on the primary database must  be  suspended  and  NDA500  must  be  processed  utilizing  the  A  option.    Secondary processing  may  continue.    During  the  period  when  NDA500  is  processing,  management personnel  should  start  investigating  the  possible  cause  of  the  errors.    Items  that  should  be considered since the last error free run of NDA500 are: 3.35.4.1.  Has a recovery of the SBSS database been accomplished? 3.35.4.2.  Were there any abnormal system crashes? 3.35.4.3.  Was there a power flux or outage? 3.35.5.  Once the cause has been identified, if possible, a decision must be made to perform a standard SBSS recovery or patch the database.   It must be noted at this time that the SBSS recovery  may  consist  of  an  audit  trail  recovery,  a  STR  recovery,  or  a  combination  of  both.  Recovery  should  always  be  the  first  option  considered  because,  even  though  patching  a database will make it structurally correct, accountability is not guaranteed. 3.35.6.  If the decision is made to patch the database, at the discretion of the MAJCOM, either MAJCOM  personnel  or  base  personnel  will  patch  the  database.    Recommend  MAJCOM personnel patch the database when possible. 3.35.7.  The first  step to be accomplished when the database is  to  be patched is  to  print  the patch file (See Para 3-58. through Para 3-60.).  After researching the list to ensure that the program generated patches are correct, the user should remove the appropriate asterisk, and then the user must reverify the set.  The user must ensure that the current set is error free prior to proceeding to the next set type.  Upon completion of the reverify, and when all errors have been corrected, the patches must be applied to the database with NGV224.  Program NGV224 will apply the patches to the database, assign the next FIX serial number to the output listing, and update the 510 record.  Each set in error will be assigned a FIX serial number.  The output from NGV224 must be signed by the LRS CC/AO or their designated representative and filed in Document Control as with any other FIX document. 3.35.8.  After the database has been patched, NDA500 should be reprocessed with the A option to ensure that the database is error free.  In addition, in the majority of cases, all patches should be accomplished against the primary database.  The only exception to this is if RPTEON on the secondary aborts due to a 799 reject with function code 03 and error code/number 92. 3.36.  Special Instructions. 3.36.1.  When  a  new  schema  is  implemented,  the  summary  file  must  be  deleted.    This  is required  to  build  a  new  summary  file  which  will  match  the  new  schema.    This  can  be accomplished by deleting file SYS$*SG$3142$0000.; G equates to each active SBSS gang. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 260 3.36.2.  In the event NDA500 should error-fin and the active runs exceed one, the status file must  be  rebuilt.    This  may  be  accomplished  by  deleting  file  SYS$*NDA500STATUS.  and reexecuting the program. 3.36.3.  If a FAC status of 440000000000 is received when attempting to print a file or patch a record, the previous file must be deleted and the print or patch must be reexecuted.  To delete these  files,  add  the  SYS$  qualifier  to  the  file  name  which  appears  on  the  first  line  of  the appropriate screen. 3.36.4.  For  SBSS,  NDA500  is  mandatory  after  an  audit  trail  recovery,  STR  (Supply Transaction Recovery),  or  IRU recovery.  All  pointers must be corrected prior to  any users accessing  the  SBSS  database.    The  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity supervisor must ensure this is complied with. Section 3I—-Database Key Format (Addressing) 3.37.  Overview.  This section describes the format used by database keys and their relationship in the storage and access of database records. 3.37.1.  A database key is the unique identifier of a record within a database.  One database key is assigned to each record in a database.  This is a physical address of the record.  The database key consists of two parts:  Area Name and Area Key. 3.37.2.  DMS 1100 implements database keys at two levels as follows: 3.37.2.1.  A high level implementation for use by the run unit. 3.37.2.2.  A low level form for the Data Management Routine (DMR) and the run unit. 3.37.3.  The DMR converts from one level to another.  A database key which is initiated by the DMR; for example, after storing a record whose location mode is via set, is available in both forms to the run unit.  Conversely, the database key supplied by the run unit before storing a record whose location mode is direct, is passed to the DMR and converted before the record is stored. 3.38.  Run Unit Database Keys. 3.38.1.  A database key consists of an area name and an area key.  It is specified in a run unit in a pair of datanames defined in the data division of the user program. 3.38.2.  The  user  (Database  Administrator  or  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity) may specify a database keyin the pair of reserved data names AREA-NAMES and AREA-KEY.  They are produced by the Data Manipulation Language (DML) preprocessors in the working or common storage section of the user program as part of the Data Management Communications Area (DMCA). 3.38.3.  The user has the option to specify their own data names to define a database key.  In this case, the area name must be in a 77-level single item data name, defined with USAGE IS AREA-NAME  clause  and  no  PICTURE  clause.    The  AREA-NAME  usage  clause  will  be replaced  by the  Data  Definition  Language/Subschema  Data  Definition  Language (DDL/SDDL) with PIC IS X(12) USAGE IS DISPLAY clauses.  An area key of a database key  consists  of  a  page  number  and  a  record  number.    These  are  always  in  DDL/SDDL processor produced subordinate items with PIC IS 9(5) USAGE IS COMP clauses for these AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 261 two  items.    They  have  the  reserved  name  PAGE-NUM  and  RECORD-NUM.    The  user specified database key will be a 01- or 77-level data-base-date-name defined with USAGE IS DATABASE-KEY clause and no PICTURE clause.  The DATABASE-KEY clause will be replaced by the DDL/SDDL with a PIC IS 9(10) USAGE IS COMP-4 clause. 3.38.4.  The Data Definition Language and the Data Manipulation Language pair data-base-data-names to specify a database key.  For example; LOCATION MODE IS DIRECT data-name-1, data-name-2 pairs data-name-1 and data-name-2 to specify a database key whose area name is in data-name-2 and whose area key is in data-name-1. 3.38.4.1.  EXAMPLE:    Assume  the  user  program  contains  these  DDL  statements  in  the data name section. 3.38.4.1.1.  77  A-NAME USAGE IS AREA-NAME. 3.38.4.1.2.  01  A-KEY USAGE IS AREA-KEY. 3.38.4.1.3.  01  LINK USAGE IS AREA-KEY. 3.38.4.2.  The COBOL source language which is produced by the DDL/SDDL processors (assuming no subschema renaming) would look like: 3.38.4.2.1.  77  A-NAME USAGE IS DISPLAY PIC X(12). 3.38.4.2.2.  01  A-KEY USAGE IS COMP-4. 3.38.4.2.3.  02  PAGE-NUM PIC 9(5). 3.38.4.2.4.  02  RECORD-NUM PIC 9(5). 3.38.4.2.5.  01  LINK USAGE IS COMP-4. 3.38.4.2.6.  02  PAGE-NUM PIC 9(5). 3.38.4.2.7.  02  RECORD-NUM PIC 9(5). 3.38.4.3.  Thus, the procedure division statements: 3.38.4.3.1.  MOVE HISTORY-FILE TO A-NAME. 3.38.4.3.2.  MOVE 1 TO PAGE-NUM OF A-KEY. 3.38.4.3.3.  MOVE 17 TO RECORD-NUM OF A-KEY. 3.38.4.3.4.  MOVE HISTORY-FILE TO AREA-NAME. 3.38.4.4.  These statements define a database key to the DMR for commands such as FIND ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD where location mode of ADMINISTRATIVE record type is DIRECT USING A-KEY, A-NAME FIND A-KEY, A-NAME.  The last two statements have the same effect.  They establish the 17th record of page 1 of area HISTORY-FILE as the current record. 3.39.  DMR Database Keys. 3.39.1.  The database key internal to the DMR consists of: 3.39.1.1.  Schema area code 3.39.1.2.  Page number AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 262 3.39.1.3.  Record number 3.39.1.4.  The  above  listed  items  are  packed  into  three  subfields  of  a  36-bit  word.    The format of the three subfields depends on schema and area descriptions. 3.39.1.4.1.  SUBFIELD BIT ALLOCATION 3.39.1.4.2.  AREA-CODE - 7 to 12 bits  PAGE NUMBER  - 9 to 18 bits  RECORD NUMBER - 6 to 15 bits 3.39.1.4.3.  The Subfield Bit Allocation shows possible formats of DMR database keys in an area. 3.39.2.  The  high  order  subfield  contains  the  area  code.    The  size  of  the  area  code  field  is constant throughout a schema once it is fixed between a minimum of 7 bits and a maximum of 12.    The  size  of  this  field  is  determined  by  the  number  of  areas  specified  in  the  AREA CONTROL clause of the DDL.  However, if the number of areas is less than 127, 7 bits will be allocated.  If the ALLOCATE clause is not specified, the subfield is assigned 12 bits. 3.39.3.  The middle field contains the page number.  The size of this field may vary throughout an area.  The size of the page number field is determined by the larger of two numbers:  the number of pages specified on the DDL ALLOCATE clause, or 21 minus the number of bits for the area code.  It has an absolute minimum in any area of 9 bits and a maximum of 18 bits. 3.39.4.  The low order subfield contains the record number.  The field must be at least 6 bits and at most, 15 bits.  Its size in an area is the number of bits not assigned to the area code or page  number  fields.    The  DML  preprocessor  provides  the  basic  structure  for  database  key conversion.    When  a  record  whose  location  is  direct  is  stored  or  found,  the  DMR  must  be supplied with a database key.  The database key (area name and area key) must be specified within the run unit before execution of a STORE or FIND command.  Refer to Unisys UP-7907,  Data  Management  System  (DMS  1100),  Schema  Definition,  Data  Administrator Reference, for additional information on Database Keys. 3.40.  Database Key Conversion Procedures. 3.40.1.  Use the following procedures for converting a database key to its area, page, and record number: 3.40.1.1.  Convert the database key to its 36-bit binary representation. 3.40.1.2.  Do an @PRT,F on the area name to get its cataloged page size.  If the minimum and maximum track size differ on the @PRT,F always use the minimum size. 3.40.1.3.  Go to table 3.1. and locate number bits used for page/record number based on the size of the area.  (Area number is always 12 most significant bits of the database key.) 3.40.1.4.  Convert binary representation of page/record number to its octal equivalent (each done individually). 3.40.1.5.  Convert  octal  representation  of  area/page/record  number  of  its  decimal equivalent (each done individually). 3.40.1.6.  You now have the area/page/record number where the record actually resides on the database. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 263 3.40.2.  Example of converting a database key located in ITMDTL-GV area. 3.40.2.1.  Given a database key of 000211270005, its binary representation would be: 3.40.2.1.1.  Bit position:      35-33   32-30   29-27   26-24   23-21   20-18 3.40.2.1.2.  000      000      000      010       001      001 3.40.2.1.3.  17-15   14-12   11-9     8-6       5-3       2-0 3.40.2.1.4.  010      111      000     000      000      101 3.40.2.2.  Since it has been determined that the ITMDTL-GV-1 area is cataloged at 6770 pages (this from an @PRT,F DMS*ITMDTL-GV-1.), go to the conversion table to find how many bits are used for the page and record.  The table will show that 13 bits are used for the page and 11 bits are used for the record number.  (The 12 most significant bits are always used for area number.) 3.40.2.3.  Bit settings for the area number looks like: 3.40.2.3.1.  Binary:  000000000010 (bits 35-24) 3.40.2.3.2.  Convert binary to octal:  0002 3.40.2.3.3.  Convert octal to decimal:  2 3.40.2.4.  Bit settings for the page number looks like: 3.40.2.4.1.  Binary:  0010010101110 (bits 23-11) 3.40.2.4.2.  Convert binary to octal:  02256 3.40.2.4.3.  Convert octal to decimal:  1198 3.40.2.5.  Bit settings for the record number looks like: 3.40.2.5.1.  Binary:  00000000101 (bits 10-0) 3.40.2.5.2.  Convert binary to octal:  0005 3.40.2.5.3.  Convert octal to decimal:  5 3.40.2.6.  The area/page/record number = Area 2 3.40.2.6.1.  Page 1198, record 5 3.40.3.  Conversion Table 1: Table 3.1.  Conversion Table 1. IF CAT STATEMENT BETWEEN: THEN, # PAGE BITS  # RECORD BITS 1-511 512-1023 1024-2047 9 10 11 15 14 13 AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 264 2048-4095 4096-8191 8192-16383 16384-32767 12 13 14 15 12 11 10 9 3.40.4.  An  ECL  runstream  released  in  your  0GV0*DBRUN$.  file  can  also  eliminate  the awkward use of manually converting these keys.  To use this database key converter, do the following: 3.40.4.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.CREATE/NDA340                    Note the above go and  CALL 3.40.4.2.  When 0GV0*DBRUN$.CONVERT/DBK. for Area/Page/Record conversion.     Note:        This only has to be processed once for each ALN’s 0GV0*DBRUN$. file.

The following section explains some of the most common errors and procedures for database recoveries.  Almost all recoveries can be prevented with little or no intervention.  By utilizing the database utilities, knowledge of the  database  and training, recoveries and database maintenance can be simplified.  Although some references to the procedures and utilities may be repeated throughout this part, remember, repetitions can be habit forming. 3.43.  Database Integrity.  Database integrity is the number one concern for the SBSS database.  If the LRS CC/AO cannot trust the balances on records then the automation of the supply account serves no purpose.  Some simple tools and techniques will be discussed that aid in checking the integrity of the SBSS database. 3.44.  Database Utilities. 3.44.1.  NGV027.  Recommend processing weekly.  Correct any errors as soon as possible and IRUDUMP the database for recovery purposes after the corrections.  It is recommended all corrections are made during normal offline processing.  That is twilight, reports, etc. 3.44.2.  0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/GV-x.    Recommend  processing  weekly.    If  errors  are found,  cease  processing  on  the  primary  and  secondary  gangs  and  dump  both  gangs.    If  the primary is clean, process NDA500 on all sets except CTH, (sets 1-65/80-102).  If there are no errors, take an IRUDUMP and resume normal primary processing.  If errors are found, correct, IRUDUMP, and continue normal processing.  If errors are found on the secondary, but not on the primary, a recovery may not have to be processed depending on the set or area that the error is in.  If you have finished all reports and none of them erred, and the error is in an area that  NGV032  and  NGV033  (RPTEON)  does  not  pass  back  to  the  primary,  then  process RPTEON on the secondary, when applicable.  Your next end of day crossover will rebuild the secondary database. 3.44.3.  0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CALC-GVx.    Process  up  to  7  calendar  days  prior  to EOM/EOQ.  If errors are found, they may either be patched by NDA500 or a recovery may be required.  Due to the complexity of DMS-CALC, these chains may be too serious to patch. 3.44.4.  DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500.  Process daily on the secondary (sets 1-65/80-102), or you may process on the primary immediately after crossover and prior to any reports.  If errors are found,  YOU MUST, REPEAT MUST, suspend all processing  and correct  these errors  as  soon  as  possible.    Your  MAJCOM  will  assist  in  any  NDA500  database  patching required.  If no errors, continue processing on the primary.  If there are errors, IRUDUMP the database.    This  will  be  a  restart  point  in  the  event  the  patches  from  NDA500  were  applied wrong.  Next, try to determine how the errors were created.  Find the most current dump.  This may have to be used as a restart point.  Patching the database is a last resort.  It may make the database structurally correct, but you may lose accountability.  That's why a recovery will have AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 269 to be done in most instances.  The same holds true for the secondary.  Most often you reload the crossover dump, process NDA500 (sets 1-65/80-102); if no errors, continue.  If you have errors, DO NOT USE AUDIT TRAIL RECOVERY because database after looks are written to the audit trail by pages, and, you would reload the same errors back to the database. 3.44.5.  In  the  case  where  your  daily  reports  reflect  transaction  histories  from  two  different dates, this usually means that you did an audit trail recovery wrong on your primary database.  VERIFY and VERIFY/CALC on the transaction history area will show that the total records in this area do not match.  VERIFY will show more records than VERIFY/CALC. 3.44.6.  Prior to any recovery due to errors from NDA500, determine which sets are involved.  If  it  is  a  set  that  can  be  recovered  by  other  means,  then  an  audit  trail  recovery  may  not  be required.  This is especially true of the secondary.  Daily reports scan the transaction history area  and  fetch  corresponding  records;  that  is  Project  Funds  Management  Record  (PFMR), ORG.  If the error is in the pseudo area it will not affect processing since the pseudo area is not used  on  the  secondary.    Other  sets  will  not  affect  reports;  i.e.    DOCNBR-GV  area  can sometimes have errors on the secondary and not effect processing. 3.44.7.  NGV061.    Process  at  least  weekly  or  when  the  area  shows  on  the  VERIFY  as  80 percent full.  This program will delete any 103 records without members. 3.45.  Recovering The Supply Database Except CTH.  The following scenarios are just a few examples of recoveries.  Although there are too many to document, hopefully these will be helpful if needed.  Remember, watch the system and use the necessary utilities to check for errors.  Don't take chances with  valuable online processing.   If in  doubt,  dump  the database and take time to research.  For reference only; we will use gang number 1 and 5 in these examples: EXAMPLE 1:  Started RELOAD/GV-1 in lieu of IRUDUMP/GV-1. 3.45.1.  Reload the most recent dump.  Either a safety or crossover dump. 3.45.2.  Audit trail up to the point when the RELOAD/GV-1 was started.  The time is on the RELOAD/GV-1 PR list.  For example, if it shows 18:14:24, you recover up to 18:14:00. 3.45.3.  Process the END input (if you were inline). 3.45.4.  Process NDA500 on all sets except CTH.  Ensure there are no pointer errors. 3.45.5.  Process IRUDUMP/GV-x 3.45.6.  RBOD 3.45.7.  Resume normal processing. 3.45.7.1.  EXAMPLE 2:  Started RELOAD/GV-5 in lieu of IRUDUMP/GV-5. 3.45.8.  Reload the most recent dump (crossover or more current) before the secondary was erased.  If the crossover dump is used, you must change the 002-PRIMARY-SECONDARY-FLG to equal a S. 3.45.9.  Audit trail up to the point when the RELOAD/GV-5 was started.  The time is on the RELOAD/GV-5 PR list.  For example, if it shows 18:14:24 you recover up to 18:14:00.  It may be easier to rerun the reports between the dump and the point the RELOAD was started than to do an audit trail recovery.  It is your choice. 3.45.10.  Process NDA500 on all sets except CTH.  Ensure there are no pointer errors. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 270 3.45.11.  Process IRUDUMP/GV-5 3.45.12.  Resume normal processing. 3.45.12.1.  EXAMPLE 3:   Falling back to  a previous dump  to  reprocess  a report on the secondary database. 3.45.13.  Process 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-5 to dump gang 5 for safety purposes. 3.45.14.  Process RPTEON on the secondary database.  This will preclude you having to reload a dump after your recovery. 3.45.15.  Reload  the  desired  dump  with  0GV0*DBRUN$.RELOAD/GV-5  inserting  the applicable tape number in the runstream. 3.45.16.  Process the desired reports. 3.45.17.  Process  0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/GV-5  and  0GV0*DBRUN$.DELETE/GV-5  to delete the secondary database.  This way, your good secondary was crossed over by RPTEON and the secondary will be rebuilt during the next crossover. 3.45.17.1.  EXAMPLE  4:    Perform  an  audit  trail  recovery  on  the  primary  database  that includes RPTEON. 3.45.18.  Reload the most current dump to the primary. 3.45.19.  Audit trail up to and just before primary RPTEON was processed. 3.45.20.  Manually reprocess primary RPTEON. 3.45.21.  Restart  the  audit  trail  after  primary  RPTEON  has  finished  the  first  time  up  to  the desired point.  If you need to recover through more than 1 day's primary RPTEON, you will need to repeat steps 2 through until all days are recovered.  Do not audit trail through primary RPTEON.  This  will cause CALC STR  recovery.  The errors will not  appear until  the next EOD  reports  are  processed.    AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  has  released SANs with information on this problem.  It is a system flaw within COBOL 74 which is being worked for COBOL 85. 3.45.21.1.  EXAMPLE 5:  Helpful hints for audit trail recoveries. 3.45.22.  For recovery of the primary: 3.45.23.  Dump the applicable gang using 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x. 3.45.24.  While the dump is processing, determine the dump and audit trail tapes and prepare and update the applicable runstreams. 3.45.25.  Down your ADS. 3.45.26.  Reload the desired dump using 0GV0*DBRUN$.RELOAD/GV-x. 3.45.27.  Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors. 3.45.28.  Start/continue  the  audit  trail  recovery.    As  a  rule,  recover  three  tapes  at  a  time.  Remember DO NOT audit through primary RPTEON. 3.45.29.  Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors. 3.45.30.  Dump the database using 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 271 3.45.31.  Repeat paragraphs above until completed. 3.45.32.  Dump the database. 3.45.33.  Resume normal processing.        Note:   Once you encounter a bad tape, you must STR from that point on.  Do not recover successive tapes by using audit trail or you will have pointer errors.  STR procedures are described in this chapter. 3.45.34.  For Recovery of Secondary. 3.45.35.  Dump the applicable gang using 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/GV-x. 3.45.36.  While the dump is processing, determine the dump and audit trail tapes and prepare and update the applicable runstreams. 3.45.37.  Reload the desired dump using 0GV0*DBRUN$.RELOAD/GV-x. 3.45.38.  Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors. 3.45.39.  Start/continue  the  audit  trail  recovery.    As  a  rule,  recover  three  tapes  at  a  time.  Remember, it may be easier to just reprocess all reports that do an audit trail recovery. 3.45.40.  Process NDA500 to ensure there are no pointer errors. 3.45.41.  Dump the database. 3.45.42.  Repeat paragraphs above until completed. 3.45.43.  Resume normal processing.       Note:     Once you encounter a bad tape, you must recover by reprocessing any reports that must be reprocessed.  You cannot STR the secondary.  STR is for recovering transaction histories.  An audit trail recovery on the secondary WILL NOT recover any secondary reports that update the primary. 3.45.43.1.  EXAMPLE  6:    Beginning  totals  on  RPTD07  do  not  match  the  ending  totals from the last EOD.  This is caused when you process RPTEON on the wrong secondary database.  You fell back on the secondary to rerun a report, but, you failed to load back the most current secondary IRU dump. 3.45.44.  Dump the secondary database. 3.45.45.  While  the  secondary  dump  is  processing,  determine  the  last  good  date  RPTD07 processed and each subsequent day you need to recover. 3.45.46.  Reload a secondary dump taken on the last good day PRIOR to RPTEON.  If that dump cannot be reloaded, or one was not taken, then you must reload the crossover dump and reprocess all reports.  DO NOT RERUN RPTD13.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE D13 UPDATES THE PRIMARY SRD-GV AREA.  ALSO, DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT RERUN THE D37.  THE CTH DATABASE HAS ALREADY BEEN UPDATED. 3.45.47.  Reload the TXHIST-GV area from the next crossover dump. 3.45.48.  Change  002-JULIAN-DATE,  002-ORDINAL-DATE,  002-REQUISITION-DATE, and 002-CALENDAR-DATE to reflect that day's transaction date. 3.45.49.  Process RPTRUN against the secondary database. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 272 3.45.50.  Process all reports including the RPTM36 if it was processed on the original EOD from that day.  DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT PROCESS RPTEON on the secondary.  Print only the D07 and D32.  Have funds or accounting and finance validate the reports. 3.45.51.  Repeat paragraphs above until all dates have been completed. 3.45.52.  Dump the secondary database. 3.45.53.  Process RPTEON on the secondary.  This will carry all totals to the primary. 3.45.54.  Resume normal processing. 3.46.  Selective ACOPY Areas. 3.46.1.  The  following  areas  can  be  selectively  copied  by  ACOPY  if  required  for  special recoveries.    In  any  event,  ensure  DMU  verifies  and  the  NDA500  is  processed  on  gaining database.  The first record of each set indicates the OWNER record for the set. Table 3.3.  Selective ACOPY Areas.

Overview.  Occasionally,  there  will  be  conditions  created  on  a  database  that  cannot  be corrected by processing normal transactions.  When these conditions exist, the records must be altered or deleted.  However, there are conditions where record alterations should never be used.  This includes NGV299, QLP WITH UPDATE, and DBE (database editor).  Use of QLP WITH UPDATE and DBE is authorized by the MAJCOM or AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity ONLY.  It is mandatory that all ERRORS should be corrected by processing a normal input or a series of inputs, such as file maintenance, reverse-post, or inventory adjustments, in lieu of QLP WITH UPDATE. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 279 3.48.  Instructions For Use of QLP With Update. 3.48.1.  Provide the DMC with a request letter of individuals authorized to process QLP WITH UPDATE on your databases.  This letter will be prepared and signed by the Supply functional AIS  manager  (LRS  CC/AO)  and  then  coordinated  with  any  other  appropriate  levels  as specified in the DISA Unisys Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) currently dated 1 October 1998. 3.48.2.  For  accounts  not  aligned  under  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Activity  constructs,  obtain  the authorization  from  the  LRS  Commander  or  designated  representative  prior  to  using  QLP WITH UPDATE.  Note the name and rank of the individual giving authorization, along with a MAJCOM control number—if owning MAJCOM requires it.  For accounts aligned under the AFMC  SCM-R  Activity,  QLP  WITH  UPDATE  will  be  requested  through  their  supporting AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity Procedures section with concurrence from the owning LRS Commander or designated representative via the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity FORCED RECORD ALTERATION (FIX) database which will assign a unique control number and allows tracking throughout the entire process.  For ANG accounts aligned  under  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Activity,  QLP  WITH  UPDATE  will  be  provided  to NGB/A4R. 3.48.3.  Stop all processing on both primary and secondary databases.  The primary database must not be inline when processing QLP WITH UPDATE.  Dump both primary and secondary databases. 3.48.4.  Process an @@PRNT command in Demand to print all input and output on a side-by printer, or send them to a PC file for printing and/or downloading to disk later. 3.48.5.  Process  the  appropriate  INVOKE  command.    Before  a  command  that  updates  the database (i.e., CHANGE, DELETE, etc.) is processed, accomplish the following steps: 3.48.5.1.  Step 1.  List the records that will be changed, verify the data selected, and ensure the correct records have been selected. 3.48.5.2.  Step 2.  Process the HOLD command to establish a recovery point. 3.48.5.3.  Step 3.  Process the command to modify the database. 3.48.5.4.  Step 4.   List the records  again  to  verify  the changed data  and  ensure only the desired records are modified.       Note:      If the changed data are not correct, process the ROLLBACK command to discard the changes.  Go back to step 1 and try again.  If the changed data are correct, go to the next step. 3.48.5.5.  Step 5.  Process the RELEASE command to accept the changes and make them permanent. 3.48.5.6.  Step 6.  Process the EXIT command to exit QLP WITH UPDATE. 3.48.6.  Dump the database that was updated, after ALL the correct updates have been made.  Process @@NOPR to stop printed output on side-by printer, or spooling output to a PC file.  Coordinate with the DMC to have the expiration date of the database “DUMPS” that are taken changed to 2 years from this processing date. 3.48.7.  Resume  normal  processing  only  after  the  database  dump  printout  is  verified  that  it contains no errors. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 280 3.48.8.  For accounts not aligned under the AFMC SCM-R Activity constructs, take all printed output from this process, to include dump tape printout for the updated database, and follow the  rules  for  documenting  and  filing  output  required  for  program  NGV299,  FIX.    A  write once/read only electronic media may be used in  lieu of printed output.  The documentation must state why NGV299 or other inputs could not be used to modify the records, along with the MAJCOM control number if required, and approval official’s name and rank.  Document Control will file the output with the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register, M10/NGV836.  For accounts aligned under the AFMC SCM-R Activity, the supporting AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity will take all output from this process and follow the rules  of  documenting  and  filing  output  required  for  program  NGV299,  FIX.    The documentation  must  state  why  NGV299  or  other  inputs  could  not  be  used  to  modify  the records,  must  include  the  database  tape  dump  number  taken  prior  to  the  update  and  must include  the  approval  official’s  name  and  rank.    AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity  will  post  all  output  documentation  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology Activity FORCED RECORD ALTERATION (FIX) database and file with the Consolidated Inventory Adjustment Document Register, M10/NGV836. 3.48.9.  While  this  process  does  not  consist  of  a  closed-end  audit  trail  (i.e.,  there  is  no automated  control  mechanism  to  ensure  that  these  processes  are  followed),  it  is  the  AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  Chief’s  responsibility  to  make  sure  that  these instructions  are  followed.    Wing  and  MAJCOM  inspectors,  along  with  Air  Force  Audit personnel, can request from DMC personnel a list of user-IDs, dates, and times that QLP WITH UPDATE was invoked (by researching audit trail tapes and spooled master console data), to provide a check of compliance with this instruction. 3.49.  CHECKLIST FOR DOWNLOAD/UPLOAD WITHOUT RESIZING. 3.49.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  a  checklist  to  utilize  for  the  download  and  upload  of  the  GV database  without  resizing.

To provide a quick review checklist for resizing an existing CTH database.  Since most CTH databases require mass disk storage, it is recommended that resizing for CTH be carefully planned due to the use of system resources and time.  All users must be notified not to use the CTH database until these procedures are completed. 3.51.2.  CTH Resizing Checklist. 3.51.2.1.

NGV330 run instructions. 3.51.2.4.  4                        Once the download is complete, resize the database. 3.51.2.4.1.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.NGVU31                                    Note                    Note:  Take option 2 for CTH.  Enter the number of records (704) required.  NGVU31 will display the number of tracks required.  The following will illustrate the basic formula for CTH: 3.51.2.4.2.  75000  =  number of tracks 3.51.2.4.3.  20  =  number of records per page 3.51.2.4.4.  20  =  subtract 20 records.  Page 1 contains the 711 record only. 3.51.2.4.5.  1,499,980  =  number of 704-CT-HISTORY records that can be stored in 75000 tracks. 3.51.2.5.  5                        Build the TEMPSCHEMA file. 3.51.2.5.1.  @FREEALL 3.51.2.5.2.  @ADD 0GV0*OUTFILE. 3.51.2.6.  6                        Install the schema. 3.51.2.6.1.  @START 0GV0*TEMPSCHEMA.ACTIVATE/SBSS-SCHEMA 3.51.2.6.2.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR          Note:   The only time that both GV and CTH needs to be down is during the processing of the two instructions AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 285 in item 6 which installs the schema.  These jobs will abort the schema and install the new  UDS  sizes  for  CTH.    Once  the  @ADD  0GV0*DBRUN$.SCHEMA/CLEAR statement has completed and the install is valid, GV can continue normal processing. 3.51.2.7.  7                        Rebuild the new CTH areas. 3.51.2.7.1.  @ADD 0GV0*DBRUN$.CTH1 3.51.2.7.2.  @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV225R       Note:    The response will be for gang number and number of tracks for the CT-HISTORY-GV-x area.  The number of tracks must be filled with leading zeros 0.  For instance, if the new size is 50000 tracks, enter 050000. 3.51.2.8.  8                        Start the upload program (UTL043).  See Ch 2, for 3.51.2.8.1.  run instructions.  Recommend a CTH dump be taken after each UTL043.  This 3.51.2.8.2.  program may take anywhere from 2 to 16 hours for each tape based upon the 3.51.2.8.3.  number of transactions for the particular month. 3.51.2.9.  9                        Process NGV330 to download the 706,707 records.

NGV330 and R60 Overview. 3.52.1.  Purpose.  To provide an illustration of programs NGV330 and RPTR60 (NGV288).  See Ch 6, for the program instructions. 3.52.2.  NGV330.  This program reads the 706 and 707 records from the CT-CTRL-GV-x area and downloads them into a SSDF  file xGV0<ALN>*GV330UD700.  This file can be edited with any ASCII processor.  NGV330 is used during the resize process if these records need downloaded or uploaded. 3.52.3.  RPTR60.  The R60 reads file xGV0<ALN>*GV783DCC., which contains the DCR images that Document Control has already cleared, and deletes/updates the CTH database.  The only time it is necessary to process the R60 is whenever a recovery of the CTH database is accomplished. 3.53.  Selective Reload Of The CTRL Area. 3.53.1.  Purpose.  To explain the procedures for the selective reload of your CTRL area.  The following records reside within the CT-CTRL-GV-x area: 3.53.1.1.  706 CT-DELINQUENT-SOURCE 3.53.1.2.  707 CT-DOCUMENT-CONTROL 3.53.1.3.  708 CT-DELINQUENT-TRIC AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 286 3.53.1.4.  709 CT-DELINQUENT-OPR 3.53.1.5.  710 CT-SUPPORT 3.53.2.  Recovery  Procedures.    Use  the  following  procedures  in  the  event  that  this  area becomes corrupt or a selective reload is required.  The CTRL area has no records with database pointers that point outside itself; therefore, a selective recovery will work, only if the CTRL area was valid prior to the recovery. 3.53.3.  Prerecovery Actions.  Ensure no users access the CTH database until these recovery procedures  have  been  completed.    First,  modify  an  existing  RELOAD  runstream  with  the following entries.  The x represents your primary gang. 3.53.3.1.  @RUN   CTLOAD,,xGV0 3.53.3.2.  @SYM   PRINT$.,,NTR??P 3.53.3.3.  @ASG,T APPL01*IRU$HF. 3.53.3.4.  @ADD   0GV0*DBRUN$.DOWN/CTHx @IRU 3.53.3.5.

After  the  reload  runstream  from  above  has  processed successfully, process the following jobs to ensure the reload was successful. 3.53.4.1.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.VERIFY/CTHx                         Note 1 3.53.4.2.  @XQT   DMS$0000*DBALIB$.NDA500                             Note 2 3.53.4.3.  @START 0GV0*DBRUN$.IRUDUMP/CTHx            Notes:   1.  This will give record totals of all CTH areas.    2.  Sets 70-73 for CTH. 3.54.  NGV299 Commands. 3.54.1.  Purpose.  To delete, store, alter individual records for automatic sets and to remove, insert or modify individual records in manual sets. 3.54.2.  Processing NGV299.  To execute NGV299, keyin the following. 3.54.2.1.  @ADD GV$$0000*GVECLUD001.NGV299R 3.54.2.2.  When the message PLEASE ENTER GV # appears, the operator must type in GV and the applicable gang number (space between GV and the gang number). 3.54.3.  NGV299 Commands. 3.54.3.1.  The  operator  may  enter  any  of  the  following  commands.    Several  of  the commands have options.  The options are enclosed in brackets.  All commands are spelled AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 287 out  for  identification  purposes  but  only  the  first  three  positions  of  the  command  are required for execution. Table 3.4.  NGV299 Commands. COMMAND AFTER AREA [Area Name] BEFORE FUNCTION Used to compare and display a record from the execution of a BEFORE command.  This command should only be executed after the BEFORE command, data was altered, and the database is to be updated.  A FIX document will be produced.  When the AFTER command is executed, data elements are displayed.  The operator should verify data elements that are to be updated.  If the elements are not correct, the operator should reexecute the BEFORE and LIST commands, retransmit, and reexecute the AFTER command.  When changes are correct, a document will be generated, and a FIX serial number assigned. Used to display the current AREA of currency if optional parameter is blank.  If parameter is entered, currency will be established for AREA NAME entered.  EXAMPLE:  AREA ITMDTL-GV-1 Used to save the current record when an alteration is to be made.  Prior to executing this command, currency must be established.  After this command is executed, the operator should execute a DISPLAY or LIST command to ensure the desired record was saved.  This command must be executed prior to the AFTER command when a record is to be altered. DELETE (RECORD NUMBER)  Used to delete the current record.  Currency must be DIRECT established prior to execution of this command.  When this command is executed, a document is produced that displays the BEFORE images of the record and a FIX serial number is assigned. Used after the AREA, PAGE, and RECORD commands to directly access records by area, page and record number.  Prior to execution of this command, you must establish database currency.  EXAMPLE: FIR 002 AREA ITMDTL-GV-1 PAGE 5 REC 1 DIR AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 288 DISPLAY  [Element Name] [Subscript] FETCH FIRST [Owner Record Type] [Set Type] [Requested Record Type] HELP INSERT LIST [Element Name] [Subscript] Used to display the current record if optional parameters are blank.  If the input parameters are entered, the ELEMENT NAME/SUBSCRIPT entered will be displayed.  The DISPLAY command lists only those data elements on a record that contains data if the optional parameters are blank. Used to FETCH a record using a CALC KEY.  The value of the CALC key must be entered prior to execution of this command.  EXAMPLE: 101-CALC-KEY = 010**12345670 FETCH or FET Used to FETCH the first record in the current area, if the optional parameters are blank.  If the OWNER RECORD TYPE is entered, the first OWNER RECORD is FETCHED.  If the SET TYPE is entered, the first record for the OWNER and SET TYPE are entered; the first record for the OWNER, SET and RECORD TYPE entered is FETCHED.  EXAMPLES: FIRST                          FIRST record in current area FIRST 101                   FIRST 101 record FIRST 101202             FIRST record in set 101202 FIRST 101202 204      First 204 record in set 101202 Used as a quick reference for program NGV299.  Commands are explained.  This command can be used anytime after you enter the proper gang number and prior to exiting the program. Used to link the current record into the current set. SET currency must be established prior to execution of this command.  This command should only be used to link records in manual sets. Used to display current record if optional parameters are blank.  If the ELEMENT NAME is entered, only the ELEMENT NAME entered will be displayed.  If the ELEMENT is in an occurs field, the applicable SUBSCRIPT must be entered.  This command is the same as the DISPLAY except, the LIST command will display all fields with values of spaces.  To list elements that have an occurs within an occurs field, (for example, 314-MACR-BC-Z and 314-CURRENT-AND-PRIOR-YEARS), enter:  LIST [Element Name] [First Subscript] ['-'(dash)] [Second AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 289 NEXT [Record Number] OCTAL OWNER [Owner Record Number] PAGE [Page Number] PRINT [Printer Name] RECORD [Record Number] REMOVE SET [Set Name] [Owner/Member Prefix] STATUS [Error Status Number] [Error Number] STORE [Record Number] Subscript].  To list the complete record without page delays, enter: LIST CON (list continue). Used to fetch the next record in AREA/SET specified by the FIRST command if the optional parameter is blank.  If the RECORD NUMBER is entered, the next record for the specified record number is fetched if in the same area of currency. Used to display the octal value of the last element displayed from execution of the LIST or DISPLAY command. Used to fetch the OWNER record of the current set if the optional parameter is blank.  If the OWNER RECORD NUMBER is entered, the OWNER record of the specified set is fetched. Used to display the PAGE NUMBER of the current record if the optional parameter is blank.  If the PAGE NUMBER is entered, currency is established for the PAGE NUMBER entered. Used to create PRINT image of data from the last execution of the DISPLAY or LIST command in the SYMIT for the PRINTER NAME command. Used to display the current record if the optional parameter is blank.  If the RECORD NUMBER is entered, currency is established for the RECORD NUMBER entered. Used to delink the current record from the current set.  SET currency must be established prior to execution of this command using the SET command.  This command should only be used to delink records from manual sets. Used to display the current SET NAME and OWNER/MEMBER PREFIX for the current record if the optional parameters are blank.  If the SET number is entered, currency is established for the SET NAME entered.  If the OWNER/MEMBER PREFIX is entered, a list of set relationships is displayed for the prefix entered. Used to display the status of the last command executed if optional parameters are blank.  The ERROR STATUS NUMBER is entered, and the definition of the ERROR STATUS is displayed.  If the ERROR NUMBER is entered, the definition of the ERROR NUMBER is displayed. Used to create new records.  Currency must be established on the records.  Currency is established by pressing the CALC key using the fetch command.  Once owner currency is AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 290 established, transmit STORE CURRENCY ESTABLISHED.  The command STORE stores the applicable record and initializes the fields.  The only valid commands after STORE CURRENCY ESTABLISHED other than DATA name entries are STORE, LIST, HELP, and STORE END which sets the program back into normal processing.  Example of storing a 102-REPAIR-CYCLE using the currency command:  EXAMPLE: FIR 102 STORE 102 101-CALC-KEY = (101-CALC-KEY) FET STORE CURRENCY ESTABLISHED 102-STOCK-NUMBER = (Enter the stock number here) STORE STORE END Refetch the 102-REPAIR-CYCLE record and input applicable system designator. Used to print the data from the last PRINT command on the printer entered in the PRINTER NAME.  If the [,U] option is blank, the print file is deleted after printed.  If the [,U] is not blank, the print file is not deleted.  To display elements that have an occurs within an occurs (for example, 314-MACR-BC-Z and 314-CURRENT-AND-PRIOR-YEARS), enter: Display [Element Name] [First Subscript] ['-'(dash)] [Second Subscript] Used to initialize all data elements in a record to spaces.  SYM [,U] PRINTER NAME XXX YES (PRINTER NAME) Used to update the database and create a hard copy of the FIX document as a result of executing an AFTER command. 3.54.4.  Use  of  Spaces.    When  a  data  element  is  being  entered  or  modified  and  blanks  are required between the data (for example:  after nomenclature field, add national stock number), NGV299 will accept the spaces. 3.54.5.  Database  Updates.    After  the  YES  command  is  entered  to  update  the  database,  the before  and  after  image  of  the  record  will  automatically  scroll  upon  the  screen.    No  further operator  intervention  is  needed.    Once  the  FIX  number  appears,  the  actual  database  update occurs. 3.54.6.  Examples of NGV299R Execution.  The following are some examples of execution of commands. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 291 3.54.6.1.

Enter SBSS-SCHEMA. 2.  Enter gang number to be verified; only one SBSS database may be entered.  For the daily run this should be the secondary gang number. 3.  Enter N for the initial daily run.  The program will change this field to a Y.  The Y option will allow the user to monitor the run as it progresses.  In addition, after the run is completed, you can execute NDA500 and review the previous run's Summary Screen (see Para. 3.58.). 4.  Enter 1-65/80-102 for daily mandatory secondary run etc.  This will bypass the Consolidated Transaction History (CTH) sets which are sets 70 through 73.  Enter A to verify all sets on the primary database.  This option is mandatory weekly.  The following are examples of set ranges:    a.  (1-10/25-28)  -  Verifies sets 1 through 10 and sets 25 through 28. b.  (1/20)  -  Verifies sets 1 and 20 only. c.  (1-30)  -  Verifies sets 1 through 30. 5.  Not applicable to SBSS. 6.  Enter DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.  Change the <ALN> to your applicable ALN.  Also, ensure to put a period (.) at the end of the filename.  If the period is missing, NDA500 will abort. 7.  Enter DMS$<ALN>.  Replace <ALN> with your ALN.  A period is not required. 8.  No entry required for SBSS.  Transmit from here to start NDA500. 9.  Self-explanatory.  Exits NDA500 processing. 3.58.

If an asterisk appears before the SOE, this indicates that the patch was generated by NDA500.  After verifying that the patch is correct, remove the asterisk after recommended patch, and transmit.  The program will be a patch file for NGV224.  If NDA500 does not provide a patch, the user must structure a patch in the same manner as the program generated patches; for example, PATCH 2.  The numeric portion of the patch represents the record number this record should be pointed to. 4.  NDA500 will display the first set which has errors.  The user must display all subsequent sets which have errors.  The user may do this by entering the next set number in the chain field. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 306 5.  Enter applicable record number to be reviewed, transmit, and NDA500 will display the next three records on the screen starting at the record the user specified. 6.

This  chapter  provides  a  complete  description  and  explanation  of  the SIFS system.  SIFS is the vehicle used in the manipulation of all SBSS data images. 4.1.1.  Purpose.    This  chapter  provides  users  with  information  to  successfully  operate  and manage SIFS processing functions. 4.1.2.  Scope.  This chapter provides detailed information on all aspects of the SIFS processing functions and its interaction with other Automated Data Systems. 4.1.3.  Audience.  The primary audience for this chapter is the SIFS Gang Monitor; however, all AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operators and LRS/Materiel Management Activity users with an interest in transmission/receipt of supply data through SIFS should be aware of information available in this chapter. 4.1.4.  Prerequisites.    SIFS  covers  many  diverse  areas  in  materiel  management  operations involving  most  of  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  functional  areas.    General  users should  have  at  least  a  basic  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  SIFS  and  their  own functional area.  This will permit users to know what SIFS will do for them.  It is recommended that, at a minimum, the SIFS Gang Monitor be familiar with the following: 4.1.4.1.  The Executive. 4.1.4.2.  TIP processing and database management. 4.1.4.3.  Mass storage file manipulation. 4.1.5.  How to use this chapter.  This chapter layout follows the same basic format throughout.  Each area is introduced to the user.  General information and a system overview is provided.  Input/output data formats and detailed program logic flow is provided in each section. 4.2.  Section 4A Overview.  This section describes Supply Interface Systems (SIFS) operations and provides a generalized overview of how SIFS interacts with the BLAMES, Automated Data Reports Submission System (ADRSS) and SBSS applications programs. 4.3.  SIFS Operations. 4.3.1.  Purpose of SIFS.  The primary goal of SIFS is to dispatch data images generated by SBSS  application  programs.    SIFS  will  dispatch  data  images  generated  by  batch  and  TIP processing.  SIFS also serves as an SBSS interface between other automated systems.  This is normally accomplished by using the ADRSS system to send and receive data via DDN.  SIFS will also transfer SBSS data images to and from Standard Procurement System (SPS) and the AFEMS. 4.3.2.  Security.  There are no classified components in the SIFS system.  All inputs and outputs to the SIFS system are unclassified.  SIFS does not handle or contain any Privacy Act data. 4.3.3.  SIFS Operations.  User intervention in SIFS operations is minimal.  SIFS is geared to, and  driven  by,  the  SBSS  applications  programs  that  generate  output  images.    SIFS  is  also AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 308 driven by incoming data processed by ADRSS (system code AA).  Normally, the user does not have to manually initiate an outbound SIFS processing run.  Rather, each time an application program generates output images, that application program automatically calls the main SIFS dispatcher.  SIFS will register outbound files in the ADRSS trigger file VAADTEU.  When ADRSS is started at the DMC, it will copy the files and verify the data for FTP transfer.  This concept  leaves  the  user  free  to  concentrate  on  the  management  of  SIFS  rather  than  the mechanics of the process.  Users can manually suppress and initiate various SIFS processes as required. 4.3.4.  SIFS  Control  Records.    The  single  most  important  aspect  of  the  SIFS  process  is  the SIFS  Control  Records.    The  Control  Records  control  the  disposition  of  each  inbound  or outbound  data  image  by  the  specific  TRIC.    SIFS  will  only  dispatch  images  based  on  the contents of the SIFS Control Records.  If data images are not being collected and dispatched properly, the probable cause is a Control Record not correctly set up.  See Sec. 4B for more information on SIFS Control Records. 4.3.5.  SIFS Header Record (722).  The SIFS Header Record is primarily used as a decision-making tool for SIFS programs.  Different options can be turned ON or OFF based on different flag settings on the SIFS Header Record.  See Sec. 4C for more information on the SIFS Header Record. 4.4.  Ownership of SIFS Records. 4.4.1.  Gangs.  Under the U2200 operating environment, there can be more than one separate and  distinct  supply  account  supported  by  the  servicing  DMC.    SIFS  will  process  all inbound/output  data  images  for  each  supply  account.    Each  gang  is  responsible  for  its  own SIFS records and all the associated actions necessary to maintain these records.  Within each gang, each system designator is responsible for their own records and all the associated actions necessary to maintain these records.  The disposition of one gang (that is, up, down, corrupted, unavailable, etc.) will not affect the SIFS processing capabilities of another gang. 4.5.  Responsibilities. 4.5.1.  The  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  will  appoint  a  primary  and  an alternate SIFS Gang Monitor. 4.5.2.  Responsibilities of the SIFS Gang Monitor.  The SIFS Gang Monitor will be responsible for the following: 4.5.2.1.  Overall SIFS operations. 4.5.2.2.  Overall administration of the SIFS database records to include: 4.5.2.2.1.  Integrity of the SIFS database records. 4.5.2.2.2.  Database save (IRU). 4.5.2.2.3.  Recovery actions. 4.5.2.2.4.  SIFS release load processing. 4.5.2.3.  Successful execution of the SIFS end-of-day utilities. 4.5.2.4.  Advise  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity    on  all  matters affecting the SIFS operation. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 309 4.5.2.5.  Provide technical support to SBSS/SIFS users. 4.5.2.6.  Function as a focal point for all questions and/or actions relating to SIFS and other interfacing ADS interfaces. 4.5.2.7.  The  SIFS  Gang  Monitor  will  provide  training  on  the  SIFS  system  to  section supervisors  and  designated  individuals.    Section  supervisors  and  designated  individuals will be responsible for providing training to individuals within their own section. 4.5.3.  LGLOS. 4.5.3.1.  Ensure  SIFS  USERS  file  is  being  worked  and  cleared  in  a  timely  manner  by appropriate section(s). 4.5.3.2.  Resolve conflicts on TRIC routing and to MAJCOM as needed . 4.5.3.3.  Ensure  SIFS  residue  is  reviewed  and  cleared  daily.    (Sec.  4D  contains  detailed information on residue.) 4.5.3.4.  Review  the  SIFS  Status  Report  daily  to  ensure  any  potential  problems  are identified and corrected in a timely manner. 4.5.3.5.  Ensure the DLA Transaction Services (DLATS) rejects in the Narrative file are worked daily.  Sec. 4D contains detailed information on the Narrative file.  SBSS no longer has the capability to monitor DLATS rejects via a demand session and the task must now be performed in Enterprise Solution-Supply (ES-S). 4.6.  SBSS Processing Modes. 4.6.1.  Beginning-of-Day  (BOD).    When  the  SBSS  starts  BOD  (program  NGV210),  SIFS program NGV243 (Stock Number User Directory (SNUD) Handler) is automatically executed.  Program NGV243 will load to pseudo any SNUD images with an effective date equal to or less  than  the  current  SBSS  Julian  date  on  the  primary  gang  002-SPECIAL-CONTROL-RECORD.  Users can suppress this option, if desired.  See Sec. 4E for more information on SNUD processing. 4.6.2.  End-of-Day (EOD).  Whenever the END image is processed, SIFS will be automatically called.  SIFS will scan all database records to check for data images which require dispatch processing.  See Ch 2 for more information on END image processing. 4.7.  Error Reporting. 4.7.1.  DIREP Submission.  If users determine they have a legitimate error condition, the user must submit a DIREP.    Users must read the procedures for DIREP reporting before submitting a DIREP. 4.7.1.1.  Difficulty Report (DIREP). 4.7.1.1.1.  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality  Assurance  Activity  is  responsible  for  monitoring, controlling, and submitting DIREPs.  . 4.7.1.1.2.  Purpose of a DIREP.  A DIREP, is an accountable, documented report of a system difficulty submitted by user activities through the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity DIREP Monitor. 4.7.1.1.2.1.  A  DIREP  provides  information  needed  to  research  and  analyze  the AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 310 difficulty the user is  having with  the system.   DIREP analysis should isolate the source of the difficulty and provide a permanent solution.  Errors which require an immediate  resolution  should  be  called  in  to  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information Technology Activity. 4.7.1.1.2.2.  A  DIREP  is  NOT  a  way  of  submitting  suggestions.    This  reporting system should not be used instead of the Air Force Suggestion Program.  Likewise, the Air Force Suggestion Program will not be used as a means of reporting program problems. 4.7.1.1.2.3.  A  DIREP  will  not  be  used  to  report  documentation  errors  to  this manual.  Editorial errors, procedural or technical inconsistencies, or requests will be submitted to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity in writing. 4.7.1.1.3.  Problem Research and Documentation.  Before a user submits a DIREP, the user and the personnel in AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance s will review the suspected problem to make sure it is a valid problem.  To submit a thoroughly researched and documented DIREP, the following personnel are recommended. 4.7.1.1.3.1.  User.  The user is the individual experiencing the problem.  The user is usually a Stock Control clerk, A&F technician, etc. 4.7.1.1.3.2.  ADPE Supply Systems Monitor.  The monitor obtains applicable data, such as TRACE files, ECL runstreams, and tape dumps. 4.7.1.1.3.3.  DIREP Monitor.  The DIREP Monitor makes sure the problem is not caused by following incorrect procedures. 4.7.1.1.4.  DIREP  Preparation.    When  preparing  a  DIREP,  provide  as  much information as possible.    It is better to provide too much information than not enough. 4.7.1.1.5.  DIREP  Monitor  Duties.    The  AFMC  SCM-R  Quality  Assurance  Activity should appoint both a primary and an alternate DIREP Monitor.  The DIREP Monitor will act as the point of contact for  the AFMC SCM-R Quality Assurance Activity.  The monitor's duties will include the following: 4.7.1.1.5.1.  Review the submission of all SBSS DIREPs created by all functional users  in  the  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  arena.    Review  the  reports  for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and correct mailing address.          Note:     Mailing address  is  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity,  Attention:    DIREP Control, 401 East Moore Dr, Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114-3001 or e-mail team4@gunter.af.mil. 4.7.1.1.5.2.  Make sure all supporting documentation is carefully labeled with the correct DIREP number and attached to the DIREP.  If the DIREP is inadequate or no supporting documentation is provided, the DIREP may be canceled.  Support documentation should include the following: 4.7.1.1.5.2.1.  Input image. 4.7.1.1.5.2.2.  Before and after inquiries (type 16 ALL DETAIL). 4.7.1.1.5.2.3.  Copy of the reject notice. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 311 4.7.1.1.5.2.4.  Transaction  trace  when  the  DIREP  involves  an  online/TIP program.    The  computer  operator  will  obtain  the  transaction  trace  using  the general purpose screen (Screen 051).  The operator places the input image on the top line, moves the cursor to the first position of the second line, and enters the word TRACE.  When he or she presses the transmit key, a file is built in RJPR01.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity operator will print the output so it can be attached to the DIREP. 4.7.1.1.5.2.5.  Report select parameter image. 4.7.1.1.5.2.6.  Aborted ECL runstream and applicable dumps. 4.7.1.1.5.2.7.  A copy of the report for which the DIREP has been prepared. 4.7.1.1.5.2.8.  All other documentation which would aid in solving the problem. 4.7.1.1.5.3.  Maintain a log of all DIREPs submitted to the DMC.  The entries for the log will have at least the following: 4.7.1.1.5.3.1.  A meaningful short title.  Use the same short title as stated on the AF Form 1815, Difficulty Report (DIREP) Worksheet. 4.7.1.1.5.3.2.  DIREP  number.    Enter  the  number  after  the  report  is  received from the DMC. 4.7.1.1.5.3.3.  Flight or section submitting the DIREP. 4.7.1.1.5.3.4.  Date the DIREP was submitted to the DMC. 4.7.1.1.5.3.5.  An entry which indicates whether the DIREP is about a program number or an SBSS screen. 4.7.1.1.5.3.5.1.  If it is against a program, enter the program number. 4.7.1.1.5.3.5.2.  If it is against the SBSS screen, enter the screen number. 4.7.1.1.5.3.6.  An entry which tells whether the DIREP is open or is closed.  If the DIREP has been closed, enter the closing date. 4.7.1.1.5.4.  Monitor  the  status  of  DIREP  solutions  provided  on  the  Worldwide DIREP Status Report (WWDSR).  Make sure all DIREPs submitted to the DMC facility are on the WWDSR.  Resolve problems encountered when a DIREP does not appear on a WWDSR by closely working with the DMC.  It is also advisable to use the WWDSR to track DIREPs submitted by other bases on problems you are experiencing. 4.7.1.1.5.5.  Formally  advise  DIREP  initiators  of  DIREP  results  and  make  the WWDSR  available  to  all  users.    All  DIREPs  submitted  by  bases  will  receive  a formal response that includes a correction of the problem if applicable. 4.7.1.1.6.  Category  Codes.    Category  codes  are  tools  used  by  AFMC  SCM-R Information  Technology  Activity  to  make  sure  reported  problems  receive  proper attention.  The category code assigned to the DIREP by the DIREP Monitor is used mainly as a guide and may be assigned a different code by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology  Activity.    All  DIREPs  are  processed  through  the  AFMC  SCM-R AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 312 Information Technology Activity, where a category code of I, II, III, or IV is assigned.  The criteria for assigning a category code are as follows: 4.7.1.1.6.1.  Category I--MAJOR IMPACT.  These problems include system loops causing  pointer  problems,  lost  audit  trails,  and  incorrect  accountable  record updating.    Normally,  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  corrects these  problems  immediately  and  releases  data  on  a  special  release.    Problems involving fatal software errors resulting in serious degradation are usually category I.  They require the following actions: 4.7.1.1.6.1.1.  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  should  act immediately to identify and correct the problem. 4.7.1.1.6.1.2.  Computer Operations must discuss the problem with the AFMC SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  before  submitting  the  DIREP.    A category I DIREP can and should be processed over the phone with the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  This phone call provides a starting point for resolving the problem.    Note:      If Computer Operations designates a problem  category  I  without  first  talking to  the  AFMC SCM-R  Information Technology Activity, then the problem is usually downgraded to category II or III. 4.7.1.1.6.1.3.  The  user  processes  the  DIREP  in  the  normal  manner  and forwards the support material to the DMC. 4.7.1.1.6.1.4.  The DMC forwards the material to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity as quickly as possible. 4.7.1.1.6.2.  Category II--SEVERE PROBLEM.  The problem stops the computer from processing input, but it does not cause looping or destroy accountable records.  Category II problems could be causing errors in recovery or upchannel reporting.  These problems are normally corrected in or with the next release to be shipped. 4.7.1.1.6.3.  Category  III--CHRONIC  PROBLEM.    This  problem  does  not  stop processing.    Category  III  problems  may  be  spacing  or  incorrect  rejects  that  are rarely encountered.  These problems are corrected in the next scheduled release. 4.7.1.1.6.4.  Category IV--COSMETIC ERROR.  These are misspelled words and all other minor program deficiencies.  Correct these problems as workload permits. 4.7.1.1.7.  Completing AF Form 1815.  The information on AF Form 1815 provides definitions and descriptions of data needed for DIREP initiation and completion.  The format  of  the  requested  information  is  similar  to  that  identified  in  the  frames  of  the mission support system (MSS). 4.7.1.1.7.1.  Section I, Information Processing Center.  This field contains the DMC number and must be numeric.  The DMC rather than the initiator completes this field. 4.7.1.1.7.1.1.  Block 1, DIREP Number.  This block consists of the following five items which make up the DIREP number: 4.7.1.1.7.1.1.1.  System  code.    Must  contain  GV  for  ILS-S  components AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 313 (SBSS, ES-S, AFSCDB, SATS) or for SIFS. 4.7.1.1.7.1.1.2.  DMC Number.  Use actual DMC reporting:  Host uses host, etc.  The DMC rather than the initiator completes this field. 4.7.1.1.7.1.1.3.  Year.  Use two-digit year in which report is initiated. 4.7.1.1.7.1.1.4.

This number allows DMC personnel to account for the DIREPs they  have  submitted  each  month.    The  DMC  rather  than  the  initiator completes this field. 4.7.1.1.7.1.2.  Block 2, Date Initiated.  This field is mandatory.  Enter the date the DIREP was initiated. 4.7.1.1.7.1.3.  Block 3, Problem Type.  Enter an X in the software block if you are filing a DIREP on GV or CH software. 4.7.1.1.7.1.4.  Block 4, System Type.  Use this field to indicate the workload configuration  being  supported.    Place  an  X  in  the  block  that  applies  to  your operating environment.  If  you check the block labeled “Other,” describe the equipment in the narrative. 4.7.1.1.7.2.  Section II, Software Description. 4.7.1.1.7.2.1.  Block 5, Qualifier.  When the software block contains an X, use this field to indicate the qualifier of the file (for example:  SBSS, USAF). 4.7.1.1.7.2.2.  Block 6, File Name.  If the software block contains an X, use this field to indicate the file being reported on. 4.7.1.1.7.2.3.  Block 7, Element Name.  When the software block contains an X,  use  this  field  to  indicate  the  program  being  reported  on  (for  example:  NGV885 for a report program or D455 for an online/TIP program). 4.7.1.1.7.2.4.  Block 7, Version Name.  Leave this field blank. 4.7.1.1.7.2.5.  Block 8, Version Date/Time.  When the software block contains an X, use this field to indicate the version of the program being reported on.  Enter  the  date/time  from  the  most  recent  PBI  Listing  for  the  program  being reported on.  The version should be in year, month, day, hour, minute, second (YYMMDDHHMMSS) format (for example:  860120122343). 4.7.1.1.7.2.6.  Block  9,  Program  Control  Number  (PCN)/  Reports  Control Symbol  (RCS)/TRIC.    Enter  either  the  three-position  SBSS  TRIC  for online/TIP programs or RPTXXX (XXX is the report number) being reported on. 4.7.1.1.7.3.  Section III, Documentation Description.  Leave blank.  Do not use a DIREP to report documentation errors. 4.7.1.1.7.4.  Section IV, Problem Description. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 314 4.7.1.1.7.4.1.  Block  14,  Short  Title.    Enter  a  meaningful  short  title  of  the DIREP.  The title can contain up to 40 characters. 4.7.1.1.7.4.2.  Block  15,  Narrative.    This  record  allows  the  user  to  enter information about the problem so the DIREP Monitor can process the report.  The user should explain the problem as clearly and concisely as possible. 4.7.1.1.7.5.  Section  V,  Initiator  Information.    The  initiator  enters  his/her  grade, name, base, organization, office symbol, and DSN number in blocks 16 through 19. 4.7.1.1.7.6.  Section VI¸DIREP.  Identify the information that goes with the DIREP.  Ensure each item is marked with the DIREP number from section I. 4.7.1.1.7.7.  Section  VII,  Coordination. coordination.  Shaded areas are for field support use only.   This  section  provides  for  DMC 4.7.1.1.8.  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity.    The  AFMC  SCM-R Information  Technology  Activity  processes  all  DIREPs  for  SBSS  system  codes  GV and CH.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is the point of contact for all DIREP information. 4.7.2.  Calling the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  Sometimes questions or errors arise that just cannot be resolved at field level or MAJCOM level.  These questions and errors should be directed to the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity at Maxwell AFB-Gunter Annex AL 36114. 4.7.2.1.  Make  sure  the  answer  isn't  already  documented  in  this  chapter,  DIREP’d,  or identified in the MAPPER System before calling. 4.7.2.2.  See Ch 2 Reporting Program Problems, before calling the FAS. 4.7.2.3.  Do  Your  Homework  First.    Run  through  the  problem  checklist  provided  in Chapter 2.  If you still can't solve the problem, then call the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  The AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is staffed by extremely  knowledgeable  individuals  who  are  willing  to  assist  you.    However,  it  is extremely hard to give assistance to a base that has not defined the basic problem and has no knowledge of the events that led up to the problem. 4.8.  Disaster,  Emergency  and  Contingency  Planning.  A  complete  discussion  of  disaster, emergency and contingency planning can be found in Sec. 4K. Section 4B—-SIFS Control Records 4.9.  Overview.  This section provides the procedures and identifies the processes required to load and maintain the SIFS control records.  This section also describes the SIFS control records and how they interact with the overall operations of SIFS.  The SIFS control records are extremely important.  All dispatch actions to be performed on each TRIC are described in the SIFS control records.  It should be noted that these records have now been standardized across the Air Force.  AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity is now responsible for releasing a consolidated SIFS routing table.  This table will contain the disposition for all TRICs routed by the SIFS control records (see Para 4.54). AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 315 4.9.1.  SIFS Control Record Processing.  The objective of the SIFS control records is to store dispatch information for each TRIC.  This information permits SIFS programs to dispatch these TRICs in a timely manner based on the mission requirements of that base. 4.10.  SIFS Control Records. 4.10.1.  General.    Users  can  load,  change,  or  delete  SIFS  control  records  but  must  have  an Authorization Number provided by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity to do so.  The inquiry option does not require an Authorization Number.  See the following paragraphs for  processing  restrictions  accomplished  individually  by  using  TRIC  1JC  (Inbound)  (Para 4.55), 1JB (Inbound) (Para 4.59), or TRIC 1JD (Output) (Para 4.57). 4.10.2.  Responsibilities. 4.10.2.1.  SIFS Control Record Contents.  The OPR cited on the SIFS control record has the primary responsibility for ensuring that all images dispatched to their file are worked in a timely manner.  It is recommended that each flight appoint a primary and an alternate SIFS Control Record Monitor.  These individuals will be the focal point for any questions relating to these TRICs and should have some understanding of IPF and CTS.  If the flight has a representative, it is recommended that the representative be appointed the primary SIFS Control Record Monitor. 4.10.2.2.  System  Designator.    The  SIFS  control  records  are  unique  to  each  system designator.  By default, data images will be dispatched based upon the control records of the host account. 4.10.2.3.  Review  of  SIFS  Control  Records.    P&A  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  each flight receives a copy of the SIFS control file.  They should also monitor each flight file to ensure all images are being reviewed in a timely manner.  P&A is also responsible for the following: 4.10.2.3.1.  Coordinating with MAJCOM to resolving routing conflicts. 4.10.2.3.2.  Management  of  the  SIFS  residue  and  clearing  SIFS  residue  in  a  timely manner. 4.10.2.3.3.  Management  of  the  SIFS  Narrative  File  and  clearing  the  SIFS  Narrative File in a timely manner. 4.11.  Loading the SIFS Control Records. 4.11.1.  Prior to load of SIFS Control table, 4.11.1.1.  Ensure all pseudo readers are empty 4.11.1.2.  Run End Card and process a file Dump 4.11.1.3.  Come back inline and down all terminals 4.11.2.  Process SIFS utility option 8 (Control Record Loader). 4.11.2.1.  When  the  new  SIFS  option  8  is  processed,  program  NGV231  performs  the following actions: 4.11.2.1.1.  Reads  the  AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  released control table. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 316 4.11.2.1.2.  Validates each TRIC’s authorization number.  (This is done to ensure that routing records were not modified prior to being uploaded.  If any position of a record has been modified, then the program will end.  A notice is sent to the AFMC SCM-R Information  Technology  Activity  console  stating  that  the  file  has  bad  records.    This notice is also printed on the SIFS history report.  You then have to load the file back from the release tape.) 4.11.2.1.3.  Reads the Base Constant record 001 to determine all active SRANs. 4.11.2.1.4.  Creates inbound and outbound records for each active SRAN. 4.11.2.1.5.  Recalculate authorization number for each record. 4.11.2.1.6.  Deletes all inbound, equate, and outbound records from the database. 4.11.2.1.7.  Loads the new records to the pseudo processor.    Note:     This program must be run for each active gang.  If your system has a gang 1 and 2, then both gangs must process option 8 to load the control table. 4.12.  Miscellaneous. 4.12.1.  Changes Made to SIFS Control Records.  Users can inquire the SIFS control records at any time.  However you must receive prior approval from your MAJCOM and AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity to change any SIFS control record.  If approval is granted AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  will  provide  you  with  the  Authorization Number needed to update request record.  Users should be aware that their user-ID (BATCH) or their user initials TIP will be recorded on the applicable SIFS control record at the time the change is made.  All changes made to SIFS control records are reported on the SIFS End-of-Day  (EOD)  Listing.    If  the  change  was  made  in  BATCH  mode,  then  the  user-ID  of  the individual making the change will show on the SIFS EOD Listing.  If the change was made in TIP mode, then the initials of the individual performing the change will show on the SIFS EOD Listing. 4.12.2.  Rejects.  The most common rejects occur when users try to load a SIFS control record that  is  already  loaded  or  try  to  delete/change  a  SIFS  control  record  that  is  not  loaded.    A complete list of rejects and corrective action is outlined in Ch 7.  A satellite account has the capability to query SIFS control record settings for the host account; however, any attempt by a satellite to change a host account’s SIFS control record will result in a 179 Reject Notice. 4.12.3.  Residue.  Any time SIFS tries to dispatch an image, it looks for a corresponding entry in the SIFS control record.  If SIFS cannot find an entry or if the entry does not provide the necessary information (entry may be corrupt), then the data image is written to residue.     Note:   The default dispatch for satellite accounts is the 01 account (that is, if NO separate entry exists for that particular Satellite account, then by default, the entry for the 01 account is used).  Items will only be sent to residue if there is NO entry for the 01 account.  Users have 24 hours in which to clear the residue.  If the image is not cleared in 24 hours, it is cited as being delinquent.  Each day the image is delinquent and the number of days delinquent are reported on the SIFS EOD. 4.13.  SIFS Inbound Data Handling.  ADRSS Inbound Processing.  The ADRSS system (system code AA) dispatches images arriving on base for systems (ADS) which are resident on the SBLC.  ADRSS extracts Supply data and passes this data to the SBSS for SIFS processing.  When Inbound AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 317 SIFS processes, the raw  inbound  data images are dispatched based on the contents of the  SIFS Inbound Control Records.  See Sec. 4G for SIFS inbound processing procedures. 4.14.  SIFS SBSS Output Data Image Handling. 4.14.1.  SBSS  Application  Program.    SIFS  directly  interfaces  with  the  SBSS  application program which generates the output data image(s).  In effect, this means that the output data images are dispatched at the time they are generated. 4.14.2.  Data Image Output.  SIFS dispatches output data images based on the contents of the output SIFS control records.  If users have any questions about specific settings for any of the output SIFS control records, they should see Para 4.50. 4.14.3.  SIFS Control Record Settings.  The following steps should be taken when a conflict occurs over settings on the SIFS control records. 4.14.3.1.  If you disagree with the standard settings outlined in Para.  4.54., then contact the  Procedures  Section  and  discuss  this  with  them.    The  AFMC  SCM-R  QUALITY ASSURANCE ACTIVITY  must determine if the requested change is to correct a routing error  or  to  improve  local  flexibility.    The  request  is  then  forwarded  to  the  supporting MAJCOM.  The MAJCOM will determine if the routing should be changed.  If so, forward the request to AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity for consideration.  Note:  SIFS Control is now standard across the Air Force.  So, in some cases, local flexibility will have to give way to the greater need of the group. Section 4C—-SIFS Header Records 4.15.  Overview.  The  SIFS  header  record  provides  SIFS  with  a  decision-making  complex.  Different  switches  and  flags  are  set  on  the  SIFS  header  record  based  on  local  events  and  local conditions.  SIFS uses these flag settings to determine appropriate courses of action during dispatch processes.  The SIFS header record also provides SIFS with constants data that is unique to that base and system designator. 4.16.  SIFS Header Record Processing.  Users can inquire the SIFS header record(s) at any given time.  Certain items may be changed by the user at any given time.  The SIFS Header Record is basically divided into three segments. 4.16.1.  The first segment contains constants information unique to that base/system designator that will be used by SIFS (that is, SPS site-ID, host DMC, etc.).  This segment is rarely updated. 4.16.2.  The second segment contains those flags that can be toggled ON or OFF by the user depending  on  local  conditions  (that  is,  SIFS  inbound  and/or  SIFS  output  runs  can  be suppressed, SPS, AFEMS transfers can be suppressed, etc.).  This segment is updated at any time depending on local circumstances.  Note:  Users should exercise care when manipulating these flags.  Failure to  properly set  and use these flags may  result in  delayed processing of inbound and output data items. 4.16.3.  The  third  segment  is  reserved  for  internal  SIFS  processing  and  cannot  be  updated unless the user performs a FIX  action for  whatever reason (see note below).  This  segment contains different flags which tell SIFS that a specific database area is full and that overflow processing is in effect.  Once the database area is cleared and the overflow file processed, SIFS will clear this flag under program control.  Note:  Be reminded that FIX action or QLP Update AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 318 should be performed ONLY AS A LAST RESORT.  Fixing data records is reserved for those times  when  SBSS  application  programs  cannot  perform  the  required  changes.    If  in  doubt, check with your MAJCOM or the FAB prior to performing this action. 4.17.  Constants Information. 4.17.1.  General.  The constants information is global to all SIFS processing runs.  The SIFS Header Record provides a convenient way to store this data.  This constants data is unique to each site and, may even be unique across system designators.  Users can change this data at any time by processing TRIC 1JA (see Para 4.61.).  Care should be taken when changing this data as it could have an effect on ALL SIFS jobs for a given system designator.  The capability now exists to store data images to the  Queue 2 area for later processing by SIFS (see  Para 4.63).  SIFS will make distribution of the TRIC based on its disposition  code loaded to the SIFS TRIC table. 4.17.2.  SIFS Constants Data.  The SIFS constants data is located on the SIFS header record and is broken out as follows: 4.17.2.1.  Site  Identification  Data.    Site  Identification  is  data  that  is  unique  to  this processing site.  This data includes: 4.17.2.1.1.  HOST-ALN and HOST-PLN.  These are used to identify the host DMC.  SIFS primarily uses this data to interface with the ADRSS system. 4.17.2.1.2.  SPS  -Site-ID.    This  tells  SIFS  where  to  send  all  data  images  that  are destined for SPS.  Blank when TYPE-BCAS-XFER is File (f). 4.17.2.1.3.  ZULU-DIFF  and  HOURS-ZULU-DIFF.    These  are  used  by  SIFS  in date/time calculations.  Users should understand that all date-time stamps used in DDN and ADRSS are converted to ZULU time.  ZULU time or Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT)  is  a  standard  time  that  provides  a  method  to  measure  events  that  are  time sensitive (that is, local time for different time zones are relative to ZULU time which is the standard).  By using this standard there is no confusion or need to convert times, so that times can be viewed in perspective. 4.17.2.1.4.  DLATS-Site-ID identifies which DLATS site to route data to.  See Para. 4.61., note 27, for a list of locations and indicators. 4.17.2.2.  Threshold  Records.    The  threshold  records  permit  users  to  control  SIFS  runs based on the volume of data.  When the number of images cumulated in a specific area is equal to the user supplied threshold count, SIFS will automatically start and dispatch these records.  The user can adjust these threshold values for optimum SIFS processing.  Each of these threshold counts has a  minimum  value of 50.  These threshold  counts do NOT apply to ADRSS bound data images. 4.17.2.3.  SIFS Hold Record.  SBSS output data images can be divided into two groups: 4.17.2.3.1.  ADRSS bound data images.  For ADRSS bound data images a routine or a priority distinction still exists, but at the ADRSS level ONLY (that is, outbound packets of data images can be sent through DDN as a priority packet or as a routine packet).  At  the  SBSS  level  (that  is,  SIFS),  a  distinction  between  Priority  or  Routine  is AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 319 meaningless,  since ALL  SBSS output data images are made available to  ADRSS as soon as they are generated. 4.17.2.3.2.  Non-ADRSS bound data images.  All SBSS output data images that are not routed to either ADRSS, SPS, AFEMS or DLATS will be placed in the SIFS HOLD DATA RECORD.  The frequency with which these images are dispatched will be based on the user specified value of the SIFS-HOLD-MAX-IMAGES.  Each time SIFS writes an  SBSS  data  image  to  the  SIFS  HOLD  DATA  RECORD,  the  SIFS-HOLD-MAX-IMAGES is checked against the SIFS-HOLD-COUNT.  If the SIFS-HOLD-COUNT is  at  75 percent  of the SIFS-HOLD-MAX-IMAGES, SIFS will automatically start  a dispatch  run.    Users  may  have  to  adjust  the  threshold  values  to  assure  optimum processing.  Users must decide if the SIFS dispatch processor is running too often.  If it  is,  then  the  threshold  values  should  be  adjusted  upward  to  allow  more  images  to collect before a dispatch run.  If SIFS is not executing often enough, then users should lower the threshold count.  See Para. 4.62.  for guidelines on assigning the threshold counts. 4.17.2.4.  Transfer Media.  Tells SIFS how to transfer images that are non-DDN bound but go outside of the SBSS (for example, SPS.  Users can select  the media  used to  transfer these images.  The transfer media code is stored on the SIFS-HEADER-RECORD in the TYPE-BCAS-XFER  field.    User  can  elect  to  transfer  these  images  by:    (E)lectronic transmission, (F)ile, or floppy (D)isk. 4.17.2.5.  SIFS Save.   Each time SIFS dispatches a file, a copy of that file is  written to elements (GANG)GV0*SIFS-SAVE.NGV250/DATETIME, (GANG)GV0*SIFS-SAVE.TRIC/DATETIME etc. follows: as  4.18.  SIFS Inhibit Flags. 4.18.1.  General.    The  SIFS  Inhibit  Flags  provide  users  with  control  over  a  variety  of  SIFS events.  Users can toggle these flags ON or OFF.  Users should exercise care when using these options, since delayed processing of images could result.  Flags are toggled on by entering a Y in  the  appropriate  field  and  toggled  off  by  entering  an  *  in  the  appropriate  field.    See  1JA format for specific options. 4.18.2.  User Options.  Users can toggle these flags ON or OFF at any time by processing TRIC 1JA (see Para 4.61).  Once the appropriate flag has been set, the applicable images will NOT be automatically processed by SIFS.  Instead, these images will be queued until the user elects to  process  these images.  Users are discouraged  from  setting these flags unless a legitimate condition exists that warrants use of the inhibit flags.  Inhibit flags can cause one or all of the following conditions: 4.18.2.1.  Data images could be routed to volatile flat-files. 4.18.2.2.  User intervention and manual dispatching increases. 4.18.2.3.  Increased chance of lost or delayed data images. Section 4D—- SIFS Utilities 4.19.  Overview.  SIFS utilities are a miscellaneous collection of programs and routines that assist the user by providing a set of tools to tailor SIFS to meet local processing requirements.  These AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 320 tools provide the user with the means to ‘force’ certain events or, to override current SIFS settings temporarily  for  the  duration  of  a  specific  processing  run.    The  DLATS  reject  management capability is only available through the ES-S system.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 4, Ch 6 for  the ES-S User’s Manual reference. 4.20.  Concept.  Each SIFS program or routine can be invoked by the user at any time.  The user does this by using the demand run of SIFS utility and taking the option for the particular run they wish  to  process.    This  is  done  by  keying  in:    @ADD  0GV00000*GVSSGUD001.UTIL  or  by processing an @XQT 0GV00000*GVABSUD001.NGV260. Section 4E—-Processing Of Stock Number Users Directory (SNUD) Data 4.21.  Overview. 4.21.1.  General.    The  Stock  Number  User  Directory  (SNUD)  is  an  Air  Force  Materiel Command (AFMC) operated data system located at  HQ AFMC Wright  Patterson AFB OH 45433-5001.  The SNUD system provides automatic distribution of catalog management for stock numbers loaded at each base.  This data arrives on base through DDN and is passed to the SBSS for processing.  A full description of SNUD processing can be found in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8. 4.21.2.  SNUD  OPR.    At  base  level,  SCM-R  Records  Maintenance  Activity  is  the  point  of contact on all matters relating to SNUD processing. 4.21.3.  SIFS  Inbound  SNUD  Processing.    The  SIFS  SNUD  handler  (program  NGV243)  in conjunction  with  program  NGV230  (Master  SIFS  Inbound  Dispatch  Utility)  provides  an automated means for processing inbound SNUD images.  Inbound SNUD data can basically be grouped into one of three areas with SIFS processing each group differently.  The groups are: 4.21.3.1.  SNUD  data  without  an  effective  date  is  passed  by  SIFS  to  the  pseudo  for immediate processing. 4.21.3.2.  SNUD data which has an effective date is held until the effective date is reached.  The data images are stored on the 729 record (SIFS SNUD DATA IMAGE RECORD). 4.21.3.3.  Interchangeable and Substitute (ISG) data used by program NGV404. Section 4F—-Outbound Processing 4.22.  Overview.  This section describes how SIFS interfaces with the Automated Data Reports Submission  System  (ADRSS).    A  brief  overview  of  the  ADRSS  system  is  also  provided  for purposes of clarity. 4.23.  Automated Data Reports Submission System (ADRSS). 4.23.1.  General.  ADRSS is an offline batch utility system.  The primary purpose of ADRSS is  to  prepare  data  reports  generated  by  all  Automated  Data  Systems  (ADS)  for  offbase distribution.  ADRSS will generate messages in the correct format for DDN transmissions. 4.23.2.  Key  files.    See  Para  4.74.  for  a  complete  list  of  files  that  are  essential  to  ADRSS processing. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 321 4.23.3.  SIFS Outbound.  SIFS is the Supply interface that submits DDN bound Supply data to the ADRSS system (system code AA).  ADRSS is responsible for translating data to a DDN acceptable format.  SIFS will submit data to the ADRSS system based on the contents of the SIFS OUTPUT CONTROL RECORD (see Para 4.57).  Normally, Supply data is submitted to the ADRSS system with minimal manual intervention.  Under some instances, users may wish to introduce external Supply data to the ADRSS system.  Introduction of external supply data is referred to as OFFLINE data submission. 4.23.3.1.  Manual Submission using 2HQ.  Authorized users can use TRIC 2HQ to submit images for later submission through SIFS.  The 2HQ provides the capability to store 160-position  images  on  the  2-HR-CARD  record  to  transceive  later  to  SIFS.    SIFS  makes disposition  based  upon  the  disposition  code  for  the  TRIC  in  positions  1-3  of  the  image stored.  See Para 4.63 for the 2HQ format. 4.23.3.2.  Manual Submission through ES-S to DLATS.  Authorized users can use ES-S to submit  transactions  directly  to  DLATS  for  subsequent  routing  (bypassing  the  normal SIFS/ADRSS  process).    Users  must  be  authorized  privileges  against  the  “FBDLATS” DoDAAC in ES-S (FBDLATS is internal to ES-S, it is not a real DoDAAC for use in any other system).  ES-S will not  derive any field  values or edits for transactions  submitted through this method so all values must be entered IAW the applicable transaction format. 4.23.3.2.1.  Single  transactions.    Single  transactions  can  be  input  through  the  ES-S general  purpose  screen.    The  General  Purpose  processing  capability  must  also  be assigned.  FBDLATS must be selected first and then ES-S will allow any transaction image to be entered.  Upon submission the image will be placed in the DLATS queue for forwarding to DLATS. 4.23.3.2.2.  Multiple  Transactions.    Transactions  can  also  be  submitted  directly  to DLATS  in  batch.    Users  are  authorized  to  submit  batches  through  ES-S  to  DLATS when  they  have  the  “FBDLATS”  DoDAAC  and  the  Batch  capability  assigned.  “DLATS”  should  be  entered  in  the  first  4  positions  of  any  transaction  being  sent directly to DLATS (that is, use DLATS in lieu of a specific base SRAN in each image in the .txt file being used to batch process transactions).  See the ES-S User’s Manual for more information. 4.23.4.  Routing Outbound Transactions through ES-S.  Outbound Transactions can be routed through ES-S instead of the normal SIFS/ADRSS process.  ES-S will then pass the transactions directly to Stock Control System (SCS) or to the DLATS for processing.   Most transactions will simply pass through ES-S to DLATS, but selected transactions will actually be subject to additional  processing.    For  example,  A0A/A01  transactions  will  pass  through  the  ES-S Automatic Lateral Support (Sourcing) logic.  Other transactions may be transformed into the new Defense Logistics Management System (DLMS) formats prior to being passed to DLATS. 4.23.4.1.  The  ES/S  TRIC  UPDATE  (Screen  1TT/183)  is  used  to  List  (L),  Add  (A),  or Change  (C)  the  transaction  identifiers  that  should  be  routed  through  ES-S.    Outbound transactions should only be routed through ES-S as directed by AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity (that is, the use of Screen 1TT to add or change transaction routing must be coordinated through AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity).  The entire transaction  identifier  does  not  need  to  be  entered,  i.e.,  “A0”  can  be  used  to  route  all transactions (i.e., through begin ES-S that with “A0” AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 322 A01/A02/A04/A05/A0A/A0B/A0D/A0E).    Partial  transaction  identifiers  should  be  used with  caution  and  they  should  NOT  be  used  when  the  individual  complete  transaction identifiers are more appropriate.  Do NOT use partial and complete transaction identifiers for the same type of transactions together.  For example, do NOT enter “AFX” and “AF” together.  Either use “AF” to route all transactions that begin with “AF” through ES-S or list each transaction separately (AF1, AFC, AFX, etc).  The 1TT transaction can only be processed through the main RPS console (Function 057). 4.23.4.2.  All transactions that are routed through ES-S will be recorded in the ES-S ATC.  Transactions  submitted  through  ES-S  to  DLATS  are  still  subject  to  DLATS  edits.  Transactions that do not pass DLATS edits and result in Narrative rejects will be returned to ES-S where they will be displayed in the DLATS Narrative Rejects area of ES-S. Table 4.1.

The ADRSS Monitor at the host DMC is the main OPR on the ADRSS  system.    The  ADRSS  Monitor  at  the  DMC  has  ultimate  control  over  all  input/output to/from ADRSS.  At a minimum, the ADRSS Monitor must coordinate report certification, data retransmissions, error/contingency processing, any routing changes, and any changes to any item connected with Supply data processing.  If the above items are closely coordinated, this will assure a smooth operation of the ADRSS system.  The results of ADRSS processing must be viewed as soon as possible.  This will allow any necessary corrections and resubmission of reports in a timely manner.  If any error conditions exist that prevent the submission of Supply data to ADRSS, it is imperative that the ADRSS monitor notify Supply as soon as possible.  It is recommended that a written  agreement  between  Supply  and  the  ADRSS  monitor  be  established  which  outlines  all responsibilities.  Good communication between the ADRSS monitor and the SIFS Gang Monitor is integral to smooth operations. 4.25.  Routing Information Changes. 4.25.1.  Overview.  The  routing information  comes from  offbase distribution instructions in documentation from the functional user system producing a data report.  It is the responsibility of  the  receiving  activity  to  notify  users  of  the  correct  routing  information  required  to successfully transceive the report.                THE ADRSS MONITOR AT THE DMC  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING THE DOCUMENTATION FOR ALL NEW SYSTEMS AND  TO  REVIEW  ALL  RELEASE  PACKAGES  TO  DETERMINE  CHANGES  TO  BE MADE TO THE ROUTING INFORMATION. 4.25.2.  SIFS Operations.  The SIFS Gang Monitor is the main OPR for the SBSS SIFS system.  The SIFS Gang Monitor has control over supply data items going to the ADRSS system.  The Supply SIFS Gang Monitor must coordinate with the ADRSS monitor on: 4.25.2.1.  Any problems related to submission of data to the ADRSS system. 4.25.2.2.  Any changes required on routing information. 4.25.2.3.  Any changes to SBSS filename(s) that interface with ADRSS. 4.25.2.4.  DDN tracer action(s). 4.25.2.5.  Error/contingency processing. 4.26.  Communications  Procedures.  Source  Documents.    Communications  procedures  are accomplished  in  accordance  with  AFI  33-112,  Information  Technology  Hardware  Asset Management and AFI 33-113, Managing Air Force Messaging Centers. 4.27.  Description of the DLA Transaction Services (DLATS). 4.27.1.  Overview.  DLATS is a real-time computer system with communication lines directly linked  to  DDN.    DLATS  has  been  designed  to  effectively  utilize  DDN  services,  thereby allowing  it  to  route  and  pass  logistics  traffic.    In  effect,  DLATS  serves  as  a  relay  station, passing data along to its final destination. 4.27.2.  Function  of  DLATS.    DLATS  receives,  processes,  and  forwards  designated transactions  (DICs)  to  the  appropriate  destination(s).    Transactions  that  are  narrative AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 326 exception/supplemental data cannot be processed by DLATS but can be processed by DDN.  SIFS will submit DLATS -bound Supply data to the ADRSS system.  The ADRSS system then passes  this  data  directly  to  DLATS  via  DDN.    Currently  DLATS  will  not  accept  any  data images greater than 80 characters in length. 4.27.3.  Destination Communications Routing Indicators.  DLATS Logistics traffic should be addressed to the correct DLATS terminal for the base’s geographic location.  If the user decides that  there  is  a  need  to  change  the  DLATS  terminal,  then  DLATS  require  at  least  5  days notification.    Within  the  CONUS,  this  may  be  determined  by  the  first  four  positions  of  the base’s routing indicator and adding ZZA.  For activities outside of CONUS, contact the local communications center.  SIFS will use the information stored on the SIFS header record and on the output SIFS control records. 4.27.4.  Content Indicator Code.  Content Indicator Codes (CICs) that can be used by bases are outlined in Annex B of JANAP 128.  At the option of the base, CIC of  IAZZ may be used without regard to the type of document.  In this case, a mix of MILSTRIP, MILSTRAP and Finance FT(x) or FA(x) transactions may be included in the same message within the same precedence.    Separate  messages  are  NOT  required  for  the  submission  of  different  CICs.  DLATS will accept messages with either the record count or in the record field of the message header.  The count, however, MUST appear in the EOT image.  ADRSS will automatically generate this information for all SBSS data that is DLATS bound.  The following CICs are used by SIFS: The CIC is required to be assigned prior to effecting transmission of data when the data content is defined with a standard CIC.  To find a CIC, see JANAP 128, Annex I. Table 4.3.  Content Indicator Codes. ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION: CONTENT INDICATOR CODE REMARKS IAZZ ZYUW ZYVW DLATS Transmission Narrative Message Service Message RETRANSMISSION: CONTENT INDICATOR CODE REMARKS ZDKW ZELX ZFD ZFGY ZYUW ZDGW Retransmission Corrected Copy Suspected Duplicate Exact Duplicate Narrative message Accuracy doubtful, correction or confirmation pending. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 327 4.28.  ADRSS Message Preparation. 4.28.1.  DLATS.  See DLATS Manual DoD 4000.25-10-M.  Text headers and text trailers will not  be  included.    DLATS  permits  the  combination  of  different  data  types  within  the  same message.  The identity of the data is at record level.  The content indicator code (CIC) and the COMM Routing  Indicator (RI) in  the ADRSS message header are the data elements  which indicate that the message will be interrogated at record level.  The data at record level indicates the destination ADS.  The TO RI and the CIC are NOT defined with DLATS. 4.28.2.  NON- DLATS.  The ADRSS header will have all the information required by JANAP 128.  (See Para 4.70 for the format of an ADRSS header.)  The ADRSS message headers do not uniquely identify the text contained within the message to the extent that it can be directed to a specific ADS for processing.  Each data report (non- DLATS) prepared by ADRSS for transmission must have a text header. 4.28.2.1.  Text  Header.    The  text  header  is  generated  by  ADRSS.    Every  data  report prepared must have a text header for each message to be transmitted.  The text header will be the first  image of each message group.  (See Para. 4.70. for a description of the text header.) 4.28.2.2.  Text Trailer.  Every data report that requires a text header must have a text trailer as the last record of the last message group prepared for the data report.  The text trailer will immediately precede the DDN trailer (EOT) record. 4.28.3.  Minimize  Considered.    When  MINIMIZE  is  imposed,  all  logistics  data  routed  by DLATS will CONTINUE to be transceived via DDN unless the message imposing MINIMIZE specifically includes logistics traffic.  In that event, output data images will be sent via priority mail. the 4.28.4.  Invalid Data.  Invalid data will cause DLATS rejects.  These rejects will be returned to file (GANG)GV0<ALN><PLN>00*NARRATIVE.  Only those documents that rejected need to be reprocessed.  The remainder of the returned messages, if any, have already been processed. originator message placed and the of in 4.28.5.  The contents of the NARRATIVE file are message packets of DLATS rejects that are returned to the SBSS account for correction and resubmission.  Each packet is identified by the following identification entry:   “ATTN:  DOCUMENTS RETURNED AS RECEIVED.  CORRECT  AND  RESUBMIT.”    Following  the  packet  identification  entry  are  the  DLATS POC telephone information, images of the actual documents being returned, and a clear test explanation of the reason for the return of the documents. 4.28.5.1.  The NARRATIVE file cannot be edited.  Attempts to edit it will corrupt it and cause the ADRSS system to lock and abort.  To use the NARRATIVE file, the SBSS SIFS monitor must catalog a SBSS work file and then copy the NARRATIVE file into it.  The NARRATIVE file contains all images returned from DLATS, both Supply and Accounting & Finance.  After the NARRATIVE file is copied into the SBSS work file it can be deleted.  This file must be worked daily to minimize delays in retransmitting priority requisitions and other valid supply transactions through DLATS.  The rejected images must be made available  to  the  responsible  section  within  LRS/Materiel  Management  Activity  or Accounting & Finance for correction.  The SBSS work file should be used for that purpose.  The into corrected extracted images should copied data and be AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 328 (GANG)GV0<ALN><PLV>00*VGV237. And retransmitted to DLATS via GV237MDR or option 17 or the SIFS utility menu. 4.28.6.  Data  Retransmittals.    If  users  require  data  packets  to  be  retransmitted,  then  users should contact the ADRSS Monitor.  The ADRSS Monitor can use the retransmittal subsystem to selectively extract data from the Cumulative History File (VAAHSTU). 4.29.  ADRSS/SIFS Interface (File Specifications).    All Supply files submitted to ADRSS for processing must comply with the following limitations: 4.29.1.  Must have an ADRSS control record (see Para 4.70) as the first record in the file, or it must be accompanied by an override ADRSS control record. 4.29.2.  Logical record length must be fixed between 80 and 1200 characters. Section 4G—-Inbound Processing 4.30.  ADRSS II. 4.30.1.  ADRSS II processes all inbound messages.  ADRSS places the inbound data images for each ADS in the appropriate files.  These files are specified in the DISN Collect Incoming FTP/DISN into 0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230.  SIFS reads the SIFS gang file to determine which gangs are active at that site and performs the following: Supply  messages   ADRSS  will (CID). place file 4.30.2.  SIFS  Inbound.    Once  ADRSS  has  passed  all  the  Supply  messages  to  SIFS,  the following actions occur: 4.30.2.1.  Program NGV230A.  The gang parameter images identify which gangs are active at the base. the takes 4.30.2.2.  Once program NGV230A has determined which Gangs are active at that base, NGV230A file 0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230. (ADRSS II places all Supply inbound images in the file 0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230.).  Copies of the ‘raw’ data are placed in gang unique files  (that  is,  ?GV0*GV230UD001.  Where  ?  =  primary  gang  number).    A  file  will  be created for each Gang Parameter Input Image provided to NGV230. inbound images ‘raw’ from the 4.30.2.3.  Program  NGV230A  builds  ECL  and  starts  concurrent  runs  for  each  Gang configured. 4.30.2.4.  If the database is available, NGV230A will read and load the following records to tables internal to NGV230A, which reduces I/O’s and possible database conflicts: Table 4.4.  NGV230A Records and Their Functions. RECORD READ FUNCTION 734 INBOUND-EQUATE Tells SIFS where each TRIC has its routing information. 722 SIFS-HEADER Tells SIFS user/program options that are set. 001 BASE-CONSTANTS-1 Provides SIFS the Base Constants data. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 329 002 SPECIAL-CONTROL Provides SIFS the SBSS Julian Date. 4.30.2.5.  Once  SIFS  has  successfully  read  these  records,  SIFS  is  ready  to  dispatch  the images. 4.30.2.6.  To facilitate the dispatch process, NGV230 prepares the images to be dispatched.  NGV230 will check to see if the ‘raw’ input data contains images for other gangs (done by examining the SRAN).  If another gang is configured at that base, SIFS will discard the data for the other GANG (Remember each Gang received its own copy of this raw inbound data file.).  If SIFS does not know what to do with any inbound data (that is, unidentified SRAN) the data will be placed in the residue file and a message will be sent to console 057.  This file will also be reported on the SIFS EOD listing.  Users will have to annotate the EOD  list  with  any  actions  performed  against  that  data  (for  example,  sent  back  to  data automation, 001 Record updated in case of a rehome, etc.). 4.30.2.7.  During  the  dispatch  process,  program  NGV230  builds  a  720-CALC-KEY  to fetch the Inbound Control Record.  The 720-CALC-KEY consists of the destination SRAN and TRIC of the image to be dispatched.  If no Inbound Control Record are loaded for the SRAN and TRIC, the image will be placed in Residue.  If an Inbound Control Record is loaded, SIFS will use the routing information for the record to dispatch the inbound data image.  See Para 4.48. Section 4H—-Air Force Equipment Management System (AFEMS) Processing 4.31.  Overview.  SIFS  will  collect  inline  AFEMS  images  for  transfer  via  DDN  to  Wright Patterson AFB OH.  AFEMS images are created and sent to the AFEMS area programmatically.  Program NGV240O collects the images and dispatches them to ADRSS.  NGV240O will be started when the AFEMS images collected are equal to or greater than 75% of the AFEMS threshold. 4.32.  AFEMS  Stacking.  When  the  AFEMS  thresholds  have  been  met,  images  from  the  748 record  (AFEMS)  will  be  read  and  written  to  file  (GANG)GV0<ALN>*1GV240.  For  ADRSS registration.  In the event that the AFEMS threshold is met and status has not been returned from ADRSS on a previous run, a message will be sent to the console typeout, and the SIFS HUD file will reflect an error, as follows: 4.32.1.  FROM THE CONSOLE TYPE OUT 4.32.2.  (GANG)GV0<ALN>*(D24801 or 1GV240) (CYCLE NUMBER) 4.32.3.  DOES NOT HAVE GOOD TRANSMISSION STATUS 4.32.4.  WHEN FILE IS SUCCESSFULLY SENT TO AFEMS 4.32.5.  CLEAR AFEMS INHIBIT FLAG TO RESTART JOB 4.32.6.  FROM THE SIFS HISTORY FILE 4.32.7.  PROGRAM STARTED WITH RUNID OF [(GANG)GV240], 4.32.8.  (GANG)GV0*1GV240.  (PREVIOUS  CYCLE  NUMBER)  HAS  BAD  STATUS  - JOB ABORTED. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 330 4.32.9.  The  images  for  the  second  run  will  remain  on  the  AFEMS  record  along  with  any subsequent  images  for  AFEMS.    Once  status  has  been  received  by  ADRSS  the  user  must execute GV240ODR from the UTILITY menu to flush the AFEMS record.  This process is known as AFEMS STACKING.  Program NGV787 (D24) works on the same principal.  If a previous  cycle  of  (GANG)GV0*1GV240.  Or  (GANG)GV0<ALN>*D24801.  (D24)  did  not receive a good transmit status (TF), the program will error and display that cycle number on the console and the SIFS HUD file. 4.33.  AFEMS Password Process.  Occasionally the user will have to retrigger files with ADRSS using the DTE screen (DTE).  This entry requires users to specify the qualifier, file name, sequence number, cycle number, and file length.  If any of the entries are in error, ADRSS will pass an error notice to the SIFS SUD file.  If this happens, the next AFEMS outbound run will error due to a previous cycle.  Users can request a control number and password that will correct that entry from the Supply Systems Control Center.  See trouble reporting, Ch 2. 4.34.  Updating AFEMS Status.  Once you receive a control number and password go into the SIFS utility option 16.  Locate the entry number of the file that has the error status.  Next, on the input line enter ‘C?’ (? = line number of the file being updated).  You will then be asked to enter your 10 digit control number, next enter your password.  The SUD file status screen should now reflect (TF) status for the AFEMS entry indicated in the change command. Section 4I—-SPS Interface Processing 4.35.  Overview.  This section describes the SBSS-SPS interface.  Each component in the SBSS-SPS  link  will  be  discussed  and  any  actions  or  responsibilities  required  by  the  SBSS  will  be discussed.  The objective of the SBSS/SPS interface is to successfully transfer data images to/from the SBSS/SPS with minimal user intervention. 4.36.  General. 4.36.1.  SPS  System  Application.    The  Standard  Procurement  System  SPS  is  a  functionally dedicated  computer  system  which  supports  the  Base  Contracting  Office  (BCO).    The  SPS system  provides  the  BCO  with  automation  capabilities  required  to  fully  support  the  local purchase  activity  at  base  level.    A  part  of  this  support  is  an  interaction  with  the  SBSS  (via SIFS)  through  the  U2200  to  pass  demands  to  contracting  and  to  receive  status  from  these demands.  This interaction may occur by tape, electronic transfer, ADRSS Search and Move (SAM), or by floppy disk. 4.36.2.  SPS System Organization.  SPS is a functionally dedicated base-level system located in the BCO.  A Wang computer is used to support SPS processing in the BCO.  The system operates in an office environment, and it is used to support local purchase requirements for the acquisition of supplies and services. 4.37.  Data Transfer Methods. 4.37.1.  SPS  Electronic  Data  Transfer.    The  SPS/SBSS  interaction  that  requires  the  least amount of user intervention and is far more reliable, is the electronic transfer.  The electronic transfer requires the SPS to be connected to a port on the U2200.  A specific SPS-SITE-ID allows data to be transferred between SPS using nine thousand remote (NTR) protocol.  By using NTR protocol, data is sent to SPS.  Data is received from SPS as though it were read AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 331 from  a  remote  input  device.    All  communications  between  the  SPS  and  the  U2200  will  be initiated on the SPS system by the BCO.  When a communications session becomes active, all data files queued to the BCAS SITE-ID will be transferred to the SPS for batch processing by SPS.  Data transferred from the Wang to the U2200 is accomplished by a batch run initiated by SPS (run-ID 0LQR0A). 4.37.2.  SAM  Data  Transfer.    When  using  SAM  to  interface  with  SPS,  make  the  following changes to the SIFS’s Header record by using the 1JA screen 547. 4.37.2.1.  Blank the BCAS-SITE-ID. 4.37.2.2.  Change the BCAS TYPE XFER to ‘F’.  Have the ADRSS monitor load your SPS output file name:  (G)GV0*GV232OUD(SRAN). To the SAM control table. 4.37.3.  Non-Electronic Data Transfer.  Under some circumstances, the electronic transfer may not be possible.  For example, the hardware configuration may not support electronic transfer, the hardware may be broken, or there may be other limiting factors.  In any of these events, data can be passed to and from SPS either by magnetic tape or floppy disk. 4.37.3.1.  Tape Transfer.  If tape is used, the BCO will generate an ‘ALQBSS’ tape.  This tape will be given to the supporting DMC for processing.  To transfer the data from tape to disk, the LQ system monitor at the DMC will run program NLQ220 against the ALQBSS tape. 4.37.3.2.  Floppy Diskette Transfer.  The SPS Wang computer is capable of reading and writing to a standard MS-DOS formatted diskette.  This allows both the SPS and SBSS to transfer data using a microcomputer.  If this method is used, local processing procedures must be developed to ensure proper control of diskettes is maintained to prevent data loss.  Any questions on this should be directed to your local BCO. 4.38.  System Responsibilities.  Good communications are essential to have effective SBSS-to-SPS  and  SPS-to-SBSS  data  image  transfers.    The  LRS  CC/AO  appoints  a  SBSS/SPS  Monitor which possesses knowledge of SBSS/SPS processes.  Responsibilities of the SBSS/SPS monitor are as follows: 4.38.1.  Establish  good  communications  with  the  BCO,  SPS  (LQ)  System  Monitor  and  the SIFS Monitor. 4.38.2.  Provide  the  SIFS  monitor  with  the  proper  SPS    site-ID,  SPS  type  transfer  and  the desired SPS  image threshold count.  Notify the SIFS monitor immediately when changes are required. Section 4J—-  SIFS User Files 4.39.  Overview.  This  section  explains  SIFS  User  files,  their  importance  and  significance  to overall  SIFS  operations.    This  section  also  describes  methods  that  allow  users  to  manage  and manipulate the data in these files. 4.40.  User Files. 4.40.1.  SIFS User files give users the capability to direct specified TRICs or program output to a file of their choice.  User files should be used when: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 332 4.40.1.1.  Users want to “hold” images to be input at a later date. 4.40.1.2.  Users want to use the images as input data into another program, such as R32 or a locally developed SURGE. 4.40.2.  SIFS User files should NOT be used to create a local safety backup of ALL images.  SIFS will handle recovery/contingency procedures.  Storing a copy of all images handled by SIFS into a local user file is a duplication of effort and an abuse of system resources. 4.40.3.  Filenaming Conventions for SIFS User Files.  SIFS will NOT perform extensive edits on filenames entered by users.  This provides users with the flexibility to tailor SIFS to local requirements.  Users should try to use meaningful SIFS User filenames.  The U2200 Executive has  certain  criteria  that  must  be  satisfied  before  a  file  can  be  cataloged  to  the  Master  File Directory (MFD).  For a discussion of the Master File Directory, see Para 4.77. 4.40.4.  Managing  SIFS  User  Files.    Users  should  understand  that  flat  files  can  be  volatile.  This basically means that data stored in these files can easily be lost, destroyed or corrupted.  There  are  many  reasons  why  your  data  may  be  destroyed  (e.g.,  operator  error,  power fluctuations, disk crash, and so forth).  However, care and attention to detail can eliminate or significantly reduce the chance of problems. 4.40.5.  Potential Error Conditions. 4.40.5.1.  Recoverable Errors.  If SIFS finds that User file specified on the Control Record is not cataloged to the Master File Directory (MFD), SIFS will catalog the file and then write the images to the file.  If SIFS finds that the User file does not have sufficient track size, then SIFS will first free the file and then reassign the file with additional tracks. 4.40.5.2.  Nonrecoverable Errors.  If another run has exclusive control of the file, or if the file is hardware disabled, SIFS will queue those images destined for the file.  SIFS will then generate a message informing the user that the user file was unavailable.  Users will then have to manually release the file. 4.40.6.  Disk Management.  It is very important that users carefully monitor disk usage.  Users must periodically clean up their files and remove those elements that are no longer needed.  Users  can  remove  unneeded  elements  by  deleting  files  identified  by  an  asterisk  using  the @PACK command.  The best way to compute file sizes is to do the following: 4.40.6.1.  @PRT,TL  Qualifier*Filename. 4.40.6.2.  Number of Words = Text Size * 28 4.40.6.3.  1792 Words = 1 Track 4.40.6.4.  Number of Tracks = Number of Words / 1792 Section 4K—-  SIFS/SBSS Degraded Mode Processing 4.41.  Overview.  This section provides an overview of disaster types that users may encounter.  A brief evaluation of cause and effect is provided for each disaster type identified.  Users should understand that this section is not an exhaustive description of potential error or disaster situations.  Local  variations  preclude  an  exhaustive  coverage.    The  second  part  of  this  section  describes AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 333 various  degraded  processing  modes  and  what  the  user  can  do  to  minimize  and  work-around degraded processing modes. 4.42.  SIFS Degraded Mode Processing. 4.42.1.  General.  The SIFS gang monitor will be the main point of contact for SIFS degraded mode processing.  LGLOS will provide assistance and technical expertise as required.  The main objective is to maintain the health of the materiel management Account and to ensure minimal impact on the processing of materiel management status and requisitions. 4.42.2.  Degraded Modes of Processing.  The SIFS Gang monitor must determine the level of degraded mode processing. 4.42.3.  Status Code A.  When the system is down due to power failure, weather conditions, or major  ADPE/software  failure,  SIFS  processing  will  resume  once  the  system  becomes operational.    If  excessive  downtime  is  expected,  then  users  must  coordinate  with  their  host DMC for alternate processing procedures. 4.42.4.  Status Code B.  When TIP processing is not available, use the SIFS stand-alone utilities for any SIFS processing that must be accomplished. 4.42.5.  Status Code C.  If the SBSS database is not available, use the SIFS stand-alone utilities for any SIFS processing that must be accomplished. 4.42.6.  Degraded  Operations  Procedures.    If  each  of  the  above  conditions  continue  for  an extended  period  of  time,  Degraded  Operations  procedures  are  most  likely  in  effect.    Any images  that  have  to  be  sent  out  should  be  given  to  the  SIFS  gang  monitor.    Users  should generate these images using either a standard text editor or and ASCII word processor.  If a word  processor,  such  as  WORD  for  WINDOWS,  WordPerfect,  or  WORDSTAR  is  used  to generate data images, ensure that the file containing the data images are in plain ASCII format.  Users may have to export the data images to an ASCII file to ensure there are no embedded control characters (i.e., tabs, carriage control characters, etc.).  Consult the appropriate word processing manual for steps to accomplish this Section 4L—-SIFS Residue Processing 4.43.  Overview.  SIFS Residue files are designed to ensure that any Inbound/Outbound images that could not be identified or dispatched are cleared in a timely manner.  The SIFS Residue files are extremely important and should be cleared as soon as possible.  This section provides detailed instructions  on  how  to  review  and  clear  SIFS  residue  images  from  the  files.    Guidance  is  also provided on how to prevent inbound and output images from being placed in residue hold. 4.44.  SIFS Residue Records. 4.44.1.  General.  The SIFS Residue files are created for each Inbound or Output file when a corresponding SIFS Control Record cannot be found.  SIFS dispatch jobs form a CALC KEY which consists of both the SRAN and the TRIC or the SRAN and the Program Number (Batch).  Using  this  CALC  Key,  Inbound  and  Output  runs  will  make  an  attempt  to  fetch  the corresponding SIFS Control Record.  If the SIFS Control Record cannot be found, the image to be dispatched will be written to the appropriate Inbound or Output SIFS Residue file. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 334 4.44.2.  Responsibilities.  LGLOS is responsible for ensuring that all SIFS residue images are cleared  as  soon  as  possible.    For  management  reasons,  SIFS  residue  images  are  considered DELINQUENT after 24 hours and require immediate action.  All SIFS Residue images will be reported on the SIFS EOD Report and will automatically be deleted if they are over 10 days old. 4.45.  Concept. 4.45.1.  Any records placed in residue will be reported on the SIFS EOD Report.  LGLOS will review the Residue portion of the SIFS EOD Report to ensure users clear residue records in a timely manner.  Any actions performed against the SIFS Residue Records will be reported by user-ID on the next SIFS EOD Report. 4.45.2.  Residue Records fall into the following general categories: 4.45.2.1.  Those images that belong to the SBSS, but SIFS did not know what to do with them because no corresponding SIFS Control Record was loaded. 4.45.2.2.  Those Materiel management images that do not belong to any account(s) at that base (misrouted data). 4.45.2.3.  Those images that do not belong to Materiel management (e.g., Medical Systems, Finance, etc.). 4.46.  Miscellaneous. 4.46.1.  Users can view the SIFS Residue files at any time.  See  Para.  4.65. through Para.  4.66. for more detailed information on IRD and ORD processing. 4.46.2.  The primary keys for transactions relating to the SIFS Residue are as follows: 4.46.2.1.  TRIC - for TIP images 4.46.2.2.  Program number - for Batch images 4.46.2.3.  - see Inbound Residue Record Format - 4.46.2.4.  // inbound packet can be deleted or treated as a whole // 4.47.  Clearing Residue Images. 4.47.1.  Inbound Residue Records (Applicable).  Users must review the Inbound Residue data images very carefully (Utility option 12 ).  If users determine that the residue records are good data images and that they apply to that base, then users should: 4.47.1.1.  Inquire the following records: 4.47.1.1.1.  SIFS Inbound Control Record.  See Para 4.55. 4.47.1.1.2.  SIFS Inbound Equate Record.  See Para 4.59. 4.47.1.2.  If these records are missing users need to load these records for the appropriate SRAN/TRIC.    Once  these  actions  have  been  completed  and  the  new  records  have  been validated, users can now clear that Inbound residue. 4.47.2.  Inbound  Residue  Records  (nonapplicable).    Once  users  have  reviewed  the  Inbound Residue data images and decide that the data does NOT apply to that base, then users must further decide if the data is Supply or Non-Supply. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 335 4.47.2.1.  Supply Data.  If the data is Supply data, but does not apply to that base, then the user must contact the base that the data applies to. 4.47.2.2.  Non-Supply Data.  If the data is not Supply data the user should return this data to  the  DMC  ADRSS  monitor  as  soon  as  possible.    In  both  cases,  users  should  try  to determine why they received the wrong data.  Users should have the DMC check their files.  If all SIFS and ADRSS file are set-up correctly and you cannot determine who the data belongs to, call the DLATS help desk at DSN:  986-3564/3247. 4.47.2.3.  Output Residue Records.  All Output Residue Records are applicable to that base.  The  vast  majority  of  Output  Residue  Records  are  most  likely  missing  an  Output  SIFS Control Record. 4.47.2.4.  Special  Instruction  for  AN(x).    If  you  receive  TRIC  AN(x)  in  the  Inbound Residue file, follow the steps below: 4.47.2.5.  Separate all AN(x) images from residue and put them in another file. 4.47.2.6.  Sort AN(x) images by SRAN, positions 32-35. 4.47.2.7.  Save file(s) by SRAN. 4.47.2.8.  Create an AN9 header record for each packet. 4.47.2.9.  Send file back to DLATS for proper distribution. 4.47.2.10.  Special Instruction for ASH.  If you receive TRIC ASH in the Inbound Residue file, delete these images from the residue file.  The SBSS is not programmed to process TRIC ASH. 4.48.  SIFS Programs. 4.48.1.  Purpose.  To provide SBSS users with a quick reference of the programs used in the SIFS process. 4.48.1.1.  SIFS absolutes are located in the following file 0GV00000*GVABSUD001. Table 4.5.

Since Inbound SNUD TRICs do not actually contain any routing  information (that is, SRAN, RIC, etc.), this routing information is actually contained within the TEXT HEADER for that inbound packet.  In the case of AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 362 SNUD, this data is in the form of a SRAN and can be found in positions 68-71 of the TEXT HEADER.  USERS MUST load a 1JB using TRIC TEX with start position 68, length 4, and type routing S. b.  A Type Routing Identifier of N should be used for SNUD TRIC  codes which have an effective date.  See section 4F for the list of SNUD TRIC codes which have an effective date.  If you enter an N in this field, the Start Position of Field to Route On (positions 12-14) must contain the starting position of the five-digit effective date.  The Field Length flag (positions 17-19) should contain 005, since this is the length of the ordinal date.  If the SNUD data image does NOT have an ordinal date, then enter 000 in this field. 6.  Authorization Number (positions 81-95).  This field is used to prevent user from modifying SIFS control prior to receiving approval from AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.  An authorization number is mandatory when the Action Code on input is A, C, or D.  This field can be blank when using the inquire option. 4.60.  Tip Output SIFS Data Image Dispatching. 4.60.1.  Purpose.  To describe the logical  flow of events during the dispatch of data images generated by TIP processing.  Any images  generated by an online TIP  application program will be dispatched as follows: 4.60.1.1.  The  application  program  calls  the  SIFS  Master  Dispatch  Utility  (program NGV250) and passes the output data image and additional information which SIFS will use to build a CALC key the applicable SIFS-OUTPUT-CONTROL record. 4.60.1.2.  Program  NGV250  builds  a  721-CALC-KEY  to  fetch  the  SIFS  OUTPUT-CONTROL Record using the following information passed by the calling program: 4.60.1.2.1.  The TRIC of the image to be dispatched 4.60.1.2.2.  The SRAN (four numeric digits) 4.60.1.2.3.  Routing Flag.  This  flag is  blank unless  the data image is  SPS-bound or AFEMS-bound.  If the image is for SPS the flag will be B.  If the image is for AFEMS, the flag will be A. 4.60.1.3.  If a 721-OUTPUT-CONTROL record cannot be found for the TRIC and SRAN in the CALC Key, SIFS will write the outbound image to the SIFS Outbound residue file.  However, if the Routing Flag (position 8 of 721-CALC-Key) is an A, B, or D the image is automatically written to the SBSS database.  Routing Flag A is written to an SIFS-AFEMS-OUTBOUND-IMAGE  record,  B  is  written  to  an  SIFS-OUTBOUND-BCAS-IMAGE record,  and  D  is  written  to  an  SIFS-DLATS-ADRSS  record.    If  the  data  image  to  be dispatched belongs to a satellite account, SIFS will first attempt to fetch the output SIFS control record for that satellite.  If there is a NO-FIND condition for the satellite account, then SIFS will next attempt to fetch the SIFS control record for the host (SD 01) account.  If there is a NO-FIND condition for the 01 account, then SIFS will then write the output data image to the SIFS outbound residue file. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 363 4.60.1.4.

Inbound SNUD Processing. 4.69.2.1.  RAW  INBOUND  SNUD.    Raw  Inbound  SNUD  is  loaded  to  the  file 0GV0<ALN><PLN>00*VGV230.  by  the  ADRSS  II  inbound  processor.    Program NGV230A  (Master  SIFS  Inbound  Dispatch  Driver)  will  recognize  SNUD  data  if  the reports control symbol (RCS) in the text header is equal to the following: 4.69.2.1.1.

For  each  of  the  above  SNUD  packets,  NGV230A  will  reformat  the  inbound SNUD data images to match those in Para. 4.68.  Once the raw inbound SNUD data images have  been  reformatted,  NGV230  will  break  the  SNUD  data  images  out  by  SRAN,  then generate a SNUD dispatch run for each SRAN.  This  run will be placed in  the inbound SIFS queue for processing. 4.69.2.3.  SNUD Dispatch Run.  The purpose of  the SNUD dispatch run  is  to  allow for modular  processing.    The  SNUD  dispatch  run  will  invoke  NGV243  (Master  SNUD Handler).   NGV243  will examine the inbound  SNUD data images and will  perform the following function: 4.69.2.3.1.  Pass those SNUD images outlined in Para. 4.68. to pseudo for processing. 4.69.2.3.2.  Examine those SNUD data images with an effective date (see Para. 4.68.).  If the effective date is equal to or less than 002-ORDINAL-DATE, then these images will be passed to pseudo for processing.  If the effective date is greater than the current 002-ORDINAL-DATE,  then  these  images  will  be  retained  on  the  SNUD-DATA-RECORD.  This process will be repeated until all SNUD data have been processed. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 387 4.70.  Text Header (TEXHD) Record Format. 4.70.1.  Purpose.

Only those files that concern Supply have been listed. Note: 1.  The ADRSS Monitor at the DMC has responsibility for these files.  Any questions or problems regarding these files should be directed to the ADRSS Monitor at the servicing DMC. 2.  Master Control File.  This file is the ADRSS master control record.  This file contains the start times for automatic ADRSS and some other pertinent information. 3.  Cumulative History File.  This file may be maintained on disk or tape depending upon local procedures.  This file contains reports previously processed by ADRSS.  Reports are kept in this file according to the as-of-date, retention period and current system date.  Reports whose retention has expired are deleted from this file.  Maintenance on this file is performed during each ADRSS run.  New reports are added and expired reports are deleted.  ADRSS allows values from 0 to 45 (days) for a retention period.  Supply Reports are normally held for 45 days.  The ADRSS monitor at the servicing DMC can retransmit any Supply reports that have NOT been deleted from this file. 4.  Trigger File.  The trigger file contains trigger records.  The trigger records identify user data files to process and/or messages to retransmit.  For Supply traffic, the trigger records will normally be generated under program control by the ADRSS monitor at the servicing DMC if it has the capability to create, modify, or delete trigger records.  The ADRSS monitor should NOT modify a Supply trigger file without prior coordination. 5.  Report Information File.  This file contains a table of all reports that are normally processed at that site.  ADRSS matches the six-position file-ID of the report, the reports control symbol, content indicator code, and the MAJCOM from Code of the ADRCTL submitted.  Once a match is found, then ADRSS uses the destination DMC code as a key to find the appropriate DDN routing indicators.  These DDN routing indicators are used in message preparation. 6.  Routing Control File.  This file contains a table of ALN codes and their associated ICI host-ID, DISN address, DDN routing indicators.  As outlined above, ADRSS uses this file to identify the appropriate DDN routing indicators to use in preparing DDN messages.  This file’s contents AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 391 are maintained through use of the screen utility subsystem (using the “RTE” or “RTU” screens). 7.  DISN Trigger File.  This file contains records that identify the files required to be transmitted via the DISN module of ADRSS.  This file can be created by either of two methods.  One method is automatically created by ADS program.  The ADS program creates a new VAADTEU file internally and in it builds a DISN Trigger record.  The other method of creating this file is through the ADRSS screen utilities (using the "DTE" screen).  The "DTE" screen will catalog a new VAADTEU file and build records within that file from the entries on the screen.  This file is read by the DISN Module Driver (NAADRV) and deleted after its contents are read.  The contents of this file are passed to the DISN Transmission Module (NAAXMT) by NAADRV. 4.73.  Sending Data By Alternate Means. 4.73.1.  Purpose.  To provide users with a brief description of the minimum requirements when sending data by means other than ADRSS. 4.73.2.  General.  This describes the minimum requirements for output data forwarded from the sending location using commercial mail and package carriers, First Class mail, or pouch.  Magnetic tape, floppy disks, and listings are the media used to forward data via mail or courier. 4.73.3.  Magnetic  Tapes.    When  magnetic  tapes  are  used,  they  must  have  an  adhesive-back label affixed that can be removed easily when the tape is released.  At a minimum the label will contain: 4.73.3.1.  RCS (or some other unique report identifier). 4.73.3.2.  As-of-date. 4.73.3.3.  Security classification of the recorded data (for Supply this is usually unclassified data). 4.73.3.4.  Number of Reels (that is, reel 1 of 3, reel 2 of 3, etc.) 4.73.3.5.  Track and density. 4.73.3.6.  Point of contact and DSN number of the sending base.  The tape monitor at the servicing DMC should be able to assist you in preparing a tape for transmission. 4.73.4.  Floppy Disk.  When floppy disks are used, data reports will be placed on the floppy disk  in  a  manner  to  preclude  individual  reports  from  getting  combined  due  to  possible mishandling of the floppy.  Each floppy must have an adhesive-back label.  At a minimum the label will contain: 4.73.4.1.  RCS (or some other unique report identifier). 4.73.4.2.  As-of-date. 4.73.4.3.  Security classification of the recorded data (for Supply this is usually unclassified data). 4.73.4.4.  Number of disks (that is, disk 1 of 3, disk 2 of 3, etc.) AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 392 4.73.4.5.  Point of Contact and DSN number of the sending base.    Note:   If the label is already affixed to the floppy disk, don't forget to use a fiber-tipped pen when preparing the label.  A ball-point pen may damage the floppy disk. 4.73.5.  Listings.  When a listing is used, it must be clearly annotated with at least the following data: 4.73.5.1.  RCS (or some other unique report identifier - may already be on listing). 4.73.5.2.  As-of-date. 4.73.5.3.  Security classification of the recorded data (for Supply this is usually unclassified data). 4.73.5.4.  Number of listings (that is, listing 1 of 3, listing 2 of 3, etc.) 4.73.5.5.  Point of contact and DSN number of the sending base. 4.73.6.  Miscellaneous.  Your servicing DMC should be able to assist you concerning policies or requirements when sending data by other than ADRSS. 4.74.  Defense Data Network. 4.74.1.  Purpose.  To describe the Defense Data Network. 4.74.2.  General.  The Defense Data Network (DDN) is a packet-switching network designed to meet the data communications requirement of the DOD.  The elements of the network are grouped into two functional areas: 4.74.2.1.  The backbone network, which comprises the trunk circuits and packet switches. 4.74.2.2.  The  access  network,  which  comprises  circuits  and  equipment  that  enable subscriber systems to connect to the backbone network.  Packet-switching is a method for handling data as it is  transmitted through a communications network.   The switching to which subscriber computers are attached subdivide information streams into small packets, then route and otherwise, handle each packet as if it were a separate message, correctly reassembling the packet data at its destination.  Each switching to receiving a packet from a neighbor node checks for errors and, should an error be found, requests retransmission from the neighbor until the data is received correctly.  The node then either forwards the packet to another node or delivers the packets to the addressee.  Unlike DDN, DDN uses adaptive packet-switching.  This means that data packets are routed adaptively instead of using predetermined paths.  With predetermined routing, data cannot be easily forwarded if any network component fails in the path over which the data must pass.  With adaptive routing,  switching  nodes  avoid  portions  of  the  network  that  are  congested  or  damaged.  Packet-switching  allows  a  real-time  access  to  any  node  in  the  world  (that  is,  can  use  a terminal input just like it was on the same base.  However, do not abuse the system; you will be held accountable). 4.75.  TRICs used by SPS. 4.75.1.  Purpose.

This chapter provides the formats for all SBSS database records.  Sec. 5A describes the organization of these files and explains the record description entries.   Ch 6 - 14 provide the purpose, access, record length, and specific record description entry for each database record.  Each chapter covers one group of related records.  The formats of the basic records are contained in  Ch 6.   Ch 7 provides the formats for entry/basic records.  The formats for the detail records ( Ch 8), the accounting and finance records ( Ch 9), the fuels records ( Ch 10), the general support records ( Ch 11), the management support records ( Ch 12), the tape records ( Ch 13), and the transaction history records (Ch 14), make up the rest of this chapter. 5.2.  Overview.  This  chapter  contains  the  formats  of  the  internal  records  stored  in  the  SBSS database and on tape under the Standard Base Supply System.  It also defines the types of record description entries used.    Note:    The database records are required.  They may not be altered except as permitted under program control with an authorized input.  The techniques used to locate all SBSS database records are contained in  Ch 3. 5.3.  U2200/400 SBSS Database. 5.3.1.  Definition of the Database.  The SBSS database is a network of hierarchically structured records appropriately associated.  The association allows for base-level update or retrieval of data  as  required  by  HQ  USAF.    The  SBSS  database  is  a  SPERRY  DMS-1100  database following  Conference  for  Data  Systems  Language  (CODASYL)  Worldwide  Standards Committee specifications.  It is defined by a schema and one or more subschemas.  The schema and subschema make up a set of tables that contain the computer code necessary for programs to gain access to the database.  The Data Definition Language (DDL) processor (SPERRY UP-7907  Data  Management  System  (DMS  1100)  Level  8R1,  Schema  Definition,  Data Administrator) describes the characteristics of the entire database.  Through the use of the data contained in the parentheses, the DDL creates the schema. 5.3.2.  Organization of the Database.  The construction of the database provides the ability to partition related records and sets.  The database allows maximum flexibility in the acquisition and placement of data with a minimum amount of time and storage requirements.  The database is currently divided into 257 areas, 236 records (of which 160 are base level and 96 are for AFMC  SCM-R  Information  Technology  Activity  ,  and  50  sets  for  each  LRS  host  account.  Each area contains one or more types of records as shown in the schema.  The SBSS record types are grouped into nine categories.  (These are described in  Ch 6 - 14.) 5.3.3.  Storage  Requirements.    Due  to  variance  in  record  occurrence  and  hardware configurations from base to base, the size of the areas is tailored to meet each base's needs.  The minimum and maximum disk storage are changed to meet individual base needs at the time of the system generation or upload.  The SBSS database requires a minimum disk storage of 1,420,720 words and a maximum disk storage of 20,950,160 words. 5.3.4.  Labeling/Tagging  Conventions.    Each  record  identified  in  the  schema  is  assigned  a unique record code.  The SBSS uses three characters for record code assignments.  All data AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 396 elements within each record use the record code as the first three characters for identification purposes. 5.3.5.  Creation  of  Subschemas.    The  creation  of  subschemas  limits  a  user's  view  of  the database to subsets of the areas, records, sets, and data names described by the schema.  The subschemas  provide  a  description  of  the  views  of  the  database.    The  use  of  a  subschema provides important protection for sensitive information and permits access to only as much of the database as the user is permitted to see.  The subschema is created by the subschema Data Definition Language (SDDL) processor (SPERRY UP-8505 Data Management System (DMS 1100) Level 8R1, Subschema Definition). 5.3.6.  Schema/Subschema Identification.  The SBSS absolute schema is identified as SBSS-SCHEMA and resides in a file called DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.  The SBSS absolute subschemas also reside in file DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA. 5.3.6.1.  EXAMPLES:  The  absolute  schema  DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.SBSS-SCHEMA  allows  the  users  to  access  the  entire  SBSS  database.    The  subschema DMS$<ALN>*SBSS-SCHEMA.SBSS-QLP1  allows  access  only  to  records  residing  on Gang 1. 5.4.  Cross-Reference - SBSS Database Record Number to Chapter/Para. Table 5.1.

Overview.  This chapter describes and contains the formats for the basic records used in the computer.   Note:  The database records are required.  They may not be altered except as permitted under program control with an authorized input. 6.2.  Record Description Entry. 6.2.1.  Level Numbers.  The first items of a record description entry are the level numbers.  The 01 level number indicates that the item is a record.  Levels 02, 03, 04, 05, etc., are used for subdivisions of group related record items. 6.2.2.  Data Name or FILLER.  Each item in the record description entry must contain either a data name or the reserved word FILLER (formerly = blank).  The data name refers to the name of the storage  area that  contains the data.   It does not  refer to  a particular value.  The item referred to may assume numerous values during the execution of the program.  The reserved word FILLER may be used in place of a data name. 6.2.3.  Independent Clauses.  Each record description entry may consist of one or more clauses that provide information about the data item.  The most commonly used clauses are picture (PIC), usage computational (USAGE IS COMP), and occurs (OCCURS) clauses. 6.2.3.1.  Picture (PIC) clauses specify the general characteristics and the detail description of a basic item.  The clause tells how many characters describes the types of characters through the use of various symbols. 6.2.3.1.1.  PIC  X(05).    In  this  example,  the  X  stands  for  one  character  of  any  kind (alpha,  numeric,  special  characters,  or  space).    The  (05)  means  that  a  five-character combination may be present in this field.  It represents the length of the field. 6.2.3.1.2.  PIC 9(05).  In this example, the 9 stands for one decimal position.  Each nine in these clauses represents one decimal position.  (For the (05) meaning, see paragraph above.) 6.2.3.1.3.  PIC  S9(05).    In  this  example,  the  S  indicates  that  the  number  has  an operational sign.  An operational sign tells the computer that the number is negative or positive.  (For the 9(05) meaning, see above.) 6.2.3.2.  Usage computational (USAGE IS COMP) clauses specify computational clauses.  All values in a computational clause represent values to be used in arithmetic operations.  The values must be numeric.  Computational clauses may be written at any level. 6.2.3.3.  OCCURS clauses specify the number of times an item is repeated with no change in  its  usage  or  picture  clauses.    In  addition,  occurs  clauses  are  used  to  define  tables, matrixes,  and  other  sets  of  data  whose  elements  can  be  referred  to  by  subscription  or indexing. 6.3.  Base Constants-1 Record (001). 6.3.1.  Purpose.  To establish and maintain the BASE-CONSTANTS-1 record.  These records are  created  by  the  computer  support  base  LGLO.    Satellite  accounts  must  coordinate  their AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 406 changes  to  this  record  with  their  CSB.    The  BASE-CONSTANTS-1  record  provides  the constant  data  unique  to  each  CSB  operation.    Most  application  and  utility  programs  in  the SBSS  use  these  constants.    Data  elements  in  this  record  must  be  current  at  all  times.    The necessary file maintenance is accomplished by input of TRIC CON.  See  Ch 2. 6.3.1.1.  Access.  Only one of these records appears in the SBSS database and is accessed in a direct mode.  The two parameters that must be initialized before accessing this record are as follows: 6.3.1.1.1.  CON-1-KEY. 6.3.1.1.2.  SUPRT-AREA-NAME.      Note:          The  BASE-CONSTANTS-KEY  is contained  in  the  SUPPORT-AREA-KEYS  record  (015-RT-001).    It  consists  of  the following: 6.3.1.1.2.1.  PAGE-NUM (4) 6.3.1.1.2.2.  RECORD-NUM (1) 6.3.1.2.  Size  and  Location.    This  fixed  record  length  is  179  words  and  resides  in  the SUPPORT-GV area of the SBSS database. 6.3.2.

The action flag is a method of programming to ensure that specific actions are taken at the time of reject.  When a reject occurs, the input and the phrase appear on the input terminal.  Additional printing and action occurs as follows:   a.  X (32) bit  =  Print the reject on the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console. b.  2 bit  =  An internal suspense record is to be established for the input. c.  4 bit  =  All records thus far updated as a result of this input are to be restored to their original  condition. 2.  The data location flag specifies the location of additional data to be printed.  The number of characters that can be assembled for printing on the printer or terminal in each area is restricted to 80.  For the AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity console, the number of characters may not exceed 60 for offline processing or 72 characters inline.  The data location flags are as follows:   a.  1 bit  =  Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-1.(reject) or MGT (management). b.  2 bit  =  Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-2. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 420   c.  4 bit  =  Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-3. d.  8 bit  =  Print data from the CSCOM-RECORD-AREA-4. 3.  The transaction identification code must always be REJ (reject) or (management). 4.  The REJ/MGT phrase message is restricted to 49 characters during end-of-day processing. 5.  The format of the management notices are identical to notes 3 and 4 except the characters MGT are the first three positions of the message.  This signifies the difference between the reject and management notice when they are printed. 6.9.  Routing Identifier Record (007). 6.9.1.  Purpose.    To  serve  as  a  data  documentation  record.    The  ROUTING-IDENTIFIER record documents processing that has occurred between the base and the  support agency to which  requisitions  are  forwarded.    The  ROUTING-IDENTIFIER  record  is  established  and maintained at base level. 6.9.1.1.  Access.    The  DMR  uses  the  DMS-1100  supplied  randomization  routine, DMSCALC,  as  the  prime  path  to  access  a  ROUTING-IDENTIFIER  record.

The unit price for items with type account code P (AVFUELS) is reflected as five-position dollars, two-position cents, and three-position mills (that is, $$$$$CCMMM) for basic item record only.  The -9 (dash 9) fuels record and all other account item records unit prices are reflected as eight-position dollars and two-position cents (that is, $$$$$$$$CC). 2.  For item records in the B account (type stock record account B), the field is as follows: a.  For repair cycle items (ERRCD XD/XF), this field contains the maintenance priority code  (code 3, 4, 7, C, L, or T). b.  For economic order quantity (EOQ) items (ERRCD XB), this field contains the stockage  priority code (code 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, A, B, C, D, or E). c.  For EOQ items (ERRCD XB) which are authorized to bypass MACR controls, this field is  identified by code J, K, L, M, /, S, T, or U.  This code is assigned by external control. d.  For item records in the P account (type stock record account P), this field contains the materiel  category code (code A, G, or L).  e.  For item records in account E (type stock record account E), this field is updated but has no effect on requirements except for code E in the equipment account.  Code E suppresses automatic due-out release. f.  Stockage Priority Code (SPC) will change to 0 under program control when processing a  backorder or upgrading to a MICAP with a UND 1, / or J and the demand level equals 0, budget code 8 or 9, ‘XB’ assets.  The (SPC) will also change to 0 under program control when processing a backorder with a UJC of ‘AR’ for budget code 8, ‘XB’ assets when the demand level is equal to 0. 3.  If the type stock record account code is K, the first position of the application code is either an N or an R.  The N or R denotes whether or not the item is subject to daily Ammunition Reporting Management System (ARMS) reporting. 4.  In the equipment account, the last position is the equipment management code. 5.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for a detailed explanation of these fields. 6.  This field is used to store the computer code on the item record.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for the specific codes. 7.  An * (asterisk) appearing in the first position of the nomenclature field indicates that the ERRCD has been changed as a result of special authority being granted prior to cataloging action.  The Department of Defense Item Code (DODIC) will appear in the first four positions of the nomenclature if, 1) the item has a type account code K, 2) the first position of the application code is an R (subject to daily ARMS reporting).  EXCEPTION:  If the first position of the nomenclature contains an * (asterisk), then the DODIC will appear in the next four positions. 8.  This field will determine the appropriate routing identifier record to be updated when processing requisitions, status, or cancellations, as follows: Table 7.3.  RID Description.

See the detailed explanation of excess cause codes (AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2 ). 10.  The demand data fields for P account item records will contain zeros. 11.  This field is used for multiple purposes.  (See AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2, for specific program control flag.) 12.  For the specific acquisition advice codes (see AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2). 13.  An R in this field indicates that the item requires releveling.  Otherwise, this field contains the first character of the date of the last releveling. 14.  For marginal analysis items, this date is the marginal analysis level computation date.  For all other items, the date of releveling will be the requisition date. 15.  Mission Impact Code (MIC) will change to 0 under program control when processing a backorder or upgrading to  a MICAP with a UND 1, / or J and the demand level equals 0, budget code 8 or 9, ‘XF’ assets.  The (MIC) will also change to 0 under program control when processing a backorder with a UJC of ‘AR’ for budget code 8, ‘XF’ assets when the demand level is equal to 0. 16.  The 101-DATE-SPC-5-ASG contains the ordinal date when the 101-STOCKAGE-PRIORITY-CODE was assigned.  This field is updated for all ERRCD XB items when the 101-STOCKAGE-PRIORITY-CODE is changed.  This date is referred to as the serviceable asset retention start date (SARD)--start date for measuring activity for retention/disposal actions.  It is assigned to ERRCD XF items when there is no demand activity for two consecutive quarters. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 461 17.  XCE date for all XD stock numbers with at least one demand and no RBL loaded in the SBSS.  This field is updated if the date stored in the field is older than 90 days from current Julian date.  A new DIC XCE is generated if the condition still exists.  This field is blanked when a DIC XCA is received for this item. 18.  Local Purchase Flag is set under program control to 0 (zero) when loading item record with Routing Identifier (RID) equal to JBB, JBF, JBG, JBH, JBK, JBL, or JBI.  This will identify those items that require a DD Form 1348-6, Single Line Item Requisition System Document, DoD (Manual – Long Form), for the first time requisitioning action.  This flag is set to 1 (one) by the status programs when status is received indicating the requisition was received by SPS. 19.  The 101-SRD-COLLECTION-FLAG equals ‘1’ if a transaction processed with SRD NOT equal to Z**; AND TRIC = DOC, DUO, ISU, MSI, TIN, OR TRN; AND TYPE-ORG-CODE = 7, 8, 9, D, G, I, Q, OR V.  Otherwise, the field will be ‘0’. 20.  The 101-FORECAST-ACQUISITION-COST stores the JCS/contingency project flag and JCS/contingency project code assigned to a given stock number. 21.  The Nuclear Weapons Related Materiel (NWRM) Indicator identifies an NSN as NWRM and the value is “Q”.  The code shall be pushed from D043 through D071. 7.4.  Repair Cycle Record (102). 7.4.1.  Purpose.  To record automatically any time an item with ERRCD XD or XF is added to the computer, or when the ERRCD on a nonrepair cycle item is changed to XD or XF.  The record  is  automatically  deleted  any  time  a  repair  cycle  type  item  record  is  deleted,  or  the ERRCD is changed to other than XD or XF.  When the stock number on a repair cycle item is changed, the stock number on this record is also changed.  The data stored on this record are used for computing stock control levels.  The quarterly data are shifted or blanked by report Q04.    Data  on  the  repair  cycle  record  are  updated  by  the  issue,  turn-in,  releveling,  and adjustment routines. 7.4.1.1.  Access.  The REPAIR-CYCLE record participates as a member of the ITEM-R-C set, whose owner is the ITEM-RECORD record.  Access is through the ITEM-R-C set.  The keys required by the DMSCALC routine area are as follows: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 462 7.4.1.1.1.  102-STOCK-NUMBER. 7.4.1.1.2.  REPCYC-AREA-NAME. 7.4.1.2.  Size  and  Location.

If no RTS, condemned, or NRTS transactions have occurred on this item, this field will contain a value of 111, which represents no base level repair action on this item.  If the percent of base repair is 100, this field will contain 99.  When this record field (102-PERCENT-OF-BASE-REPAIR) contains 111, the SBSS programs will display this field as blank.  CAUTION:  If the Query Language Processor (QLP-1100) and/or direct retrieval of SBSS database record data is used, extreme caution must be used.  On a new item load (FIL), ‘100’ is stored in this field.  This will be updated during releveling to ‘111’. 7.5.  Document Number Record (103). 7.5.1.  Purpose.  To provide an alternate access path to the AUTHORIZED-IN-USE-DETAIL record and the detail records. 7.5.1.1.  Access.    The  DMR  uses  the  DMS-1100  supplied  randomization  routine, DMSCALC, as the prime path to access a DOCUMENT-NBR record.

To provide for the relating of different  items  that may be used to  satisfy a requirement.  The issue routine uses the record in an attempt to satisfy a requested quantity when  the  balance  on  the  requested  item  is  insufficient.    Items  coded  master  (M)  or interchangeable (I) are issued automatically while other codings provide only an asset printout for an external decision.  The record is established for an external decision.  At base level it is established, changed, and deleted by using file maintenance procedures.  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 8 for an explanation of ISG records. 7.6.1.1.  Access.    The  INTERCHANGE-SUBSTITUTE-GROUP  record  is  accessed through a DMS-1100, DMSCALC, randomization routine.

Due-In Detail Record (202). 8.3.1.  Purpose.  To record (other than for fuels) information from the original requisition that is  required  for  follow-up  and/or  base  management.    A  due-in  detail  is  established  for  each requisition  submitted.    When  the  total  due-in  balance  is  required,  program  control  adds quantities on due-in detail records to provide a net asset position.  In addition to the quantity of an item due-in and the requisition number, the due-in detail also is used to compute price variances and pipeline time during processing of the receipt.  A due-in  detail  is  established under program control when an automatic requisition is made.  Action must be taken to load a due-in detail when a requisition is initiated offline while the SBLC is down or in a Degraded Operations situation. 8.3.1.1.  The record is automatically eliminated when a receipt for the quantity due-in is processed.    In  addition,  a  due-in  detail  may  be  cancelled  by  an  input.    The  request  for cancellation is submitted to the appropriate supply source.  When this is accomplished, a record of the request for cancellation is also established as a detail in the computer.  When it is necessary to analyze the due-in details, it is also necessary to determine if a cancellation request  has  been  submitted.    When  the  source  of  supply  acknowledges  cancellation,  an input automatically causes cancellation.  Due-ins are not cancelled automatically when in an excess position. 8.3.1.2.  The  fuels  DUE-IN  DETAIL  record  contains  information  from  the  original requisition (1PR).  A due-in detail is established for each 1PR input.  The due-in detail is automatically deleted when a 1RP (fuels receipt) is input for the actual quantity due-in or if the input 1RP contains a final receipt flag (position 53 = F).  The due-in detail may be cancelled by processing  a 1PC (fuels  cancellation).  (Notes 10-14 below, apply  to  fuels account P only.) 8.3.2.  Access.  The DUE-IN-DETAIL/fuels due-in detail record is a member of the ITEM-DTLS  set,  whose  owner  record  is  the  ITEM-RECORD  record,  and  the  DOCN-DTLS  set, whose owner is the DOCUMENT-NBR record.  The primary path is through the ITEM-DTLS set and alternate path is through the DOCN-DTLS set. 8.3.3.  Size And Location.

To  identify  items  for  control  and  reporting  purposes  which  are  physically located in maintenance, or for which a due-out exists.  The DIFM detail records with DIFM status flag zero, with the exception of UR exhibits, are considered as on-hand assets for stock leveling  computation.    The  DIFM  detail  record  is  established  automatically  under  program control when a repair cycle item is either issued or backordered on a recurring or nonrecurring basis.  The DIFM detail record is deleted or updated at the time the item is turned in either condemned, reparable (NRTS) or as a serviceable item.  The only other means by which the DIFM  detail  record  is  eliminated  is  by  canceling  the  due-out  detail  record  and/or  using  the inventory adjustment procedures. 8.4.1.1.  Access.  The DUE-IN-FROM-MAINTENANCE-DETAIL record is a member of the  ITEM-DTLS  set,  whose  owner  record  is  ITEM-RECORD  record,  and  the  DOCN-DTLS set, whose owner is the DOCUMENT-NBR record.

If the 203-REPAIR-RETURN-FLAG field contains an R, the last 12 positions of the document number from positions 69-80 of the original issue request are shown in the 203-PREVIOUS-DIFM-STATUS through 203-WORK-UNIT-CODE and 203-SRD fields.  This is where the document number is reflected on the 203 detail at the repair location. 3.  A P in this position indicates that item record number of demands has been updated for this detail as a result of turn-in or due-out cancellation action. 4.  This field contains the last two characters of the routing identifier code of the activity that generated the reparable when the asset was generated at an off-base activity. 5.  For contract maintenance details, this position is blank or contains the equipment authorized inventory data (EAID) flag.  If the reparable was generated by a lateral base, this position contains a Q.  When the detail is created as a result of an issue from a WRM or MRSP detail (including activity code C, AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 484 functional check), this position contains an H for high priority mission support kit (HPMSK) assets or a W for all other WRM/MRSP assets. 6.  When the first position of the MAJCOM-CODE is blank, internal logic equates it to 0; an octal 1 equates to 4.  (The first five bits of the first position of the MAJCOM-CODE are reserved for future use.) 7.  For type organization code G, V, I, 7, 8, and 9 or when the last position of the UJC is R, the field contains the actual command code from the input or the organization record. 8.  This field reflects the total delayed maintenance/AWP days accumulated against this item.  A flag is stored in the low order position of this field indicating that these days are to be subtracted from the total repair cycle days.   9.  For Maintenance (J Activity Code) this field contains the Job Control Number. 10.  This field contains the JOCAS number for JOCAS organizations. 11.  This field contains the 201 document number of the shipping activity and will have an activity code of E for equipment or P for supplies. 8.5.  Unserviceable Detail Record (204). 8.5.1.  Purpose.  To identify items that are physically located in supply stock in unserviceable condition or Deficiency Report exhibit items located in Maintenance.  The unserviceable detail record  is  established  automatically  under  program  control  when  an  unserviceable  asset  is picked  up  on  the  CSB  accountable  records.    The  unserviceable  detail  record  is  updated  or deleted at the time the asset is shipped/transferred or issued to Maintenance for repair.  The only  other  means  by  which  the  unserviceable  detail  record  will  be  reduced  in  quantity  or eliminated is by inventory adjustment procedures. 8.5.1.1.  Access.    The  UNSERVICEABLE-DETAIL  record  is  a  member  of  the  ITEM-DTLS set, whose owner record is the ITEM-RECORD record, and the DOCN-DTLS set, whose owner is DOCUMENT-NBR record.

This field contains the constant N. 3.  Load each system designator (SD) maintained in the SBSS database. 4.  These data are used by programs NGV976 and NGV983 for the production of outputs M18 and 1CS.  Load the parent command code applicable to the host or satellite. 5.  This Accounting and Finance disbursing station number (ADSN) is entered in all Z (MGL) outputs, regardless of the system designator.  In this area, load the ADSN of the Accounting and Finance Office (AFO) responsible for monitoring and controlling the financial transactions processed on the U2200/400 (SBSS/GV). 6.  The following information applies:  a.  This field has two purposes:   surcharge is applicable to this system designator. (1)  It indicates to program NGV972/M01 if the General Services Administration (GSA)   (2)  It indicates to programs NGV980 and NGV976 if this system designator is a depot maintenance service location.  At depot maintenance locations, the materiel category/source of supply code (MC/SS) O is updated instead of MC/SS Z for transactions containing item record RIC JBD, JBT, or JBI.     b.  Load this field as follows:    (1)  Does the GSA surcharge apply?  (See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M)                         Y N N Y (2)  Is this a depot maintenance service location?

The nine occurrences of the 310-SAT-DATA field are the system designators A1 through A9. 8.  If the CSB does not support this satellite system designator, leave the field blank. 9.  Load each four-position SRAN supported or maintained on the SBSS database U2200/400 (SBSS/GV).  The host SRAN is used for Trial Balance reporting and other output products for each nonautonomous satellite.  The applicable satellite SRAN is used for autonomous satellites. 10.  This field indicates whether the satellite is autonomous; that is, whether it is operated as a separate system with its own operating program and trial balance.  If the satellite is autonomous, output containing the satellite SRAN is produced.  If the satellite is nonautonomous, output containing the host SRAN is produced.  A flag is provided for each type of account code (B, E, or P).  Load the flags as follows: a.  For the 310-B-E-ACCT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG field, load Y if the satellite operating the B  or E account is autonomous.  Load N if the satellite is nonautonomous. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 562 b.  For the 310-FUELS-ACT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG field, load Y if the satellite operating the P  account is autonomous.  Load N if the satellite is nonautonomous.  CAUTION:  The 310-B-E-ACCT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG and 310-FUELS-ACCT-AUTONOMOUS-FLAG fields must contain either a Y or N.  Therefore, load N if a B, E, or P account is not supported by the satellite. 11.  The following information applies: a.  This field has two purposes.  It indicates to programs NGV981/D10 and NGV985/D32  whether output from the U2200/400 is required at the satellite location.

Stock Fund Inventory Management Record (SFIMR) (312).        9.12.1.  Purpose.  To provide the storage media for the  accumulation of financial inventory transaction data affecting all divisions of the Air Force SMAG.  A separate STOCK-FUND-INV-MGMT  record  is  established  for  each  materiel  category  and/or  source  of  supply  code within each budget code (1, 4, 6, 8, or 9) for each system designator (01, A1 through A9).  The data accumulated in this record are used for preparation of the operating program. 9.12.1.1.  End-of-Day  Processing.    As  a  part  of  the  Accounting  and  Finance  end-of-day processing,  the  monetary  fields  are  updated  according  to  information  stored  in  the transaction  history  records.    The  U2200/400  program,  which  prints  the  Stock  Fund Inventory Management Report (M18), performs an Inventory Management Record (IMR) total and update function to assure that the IMR inventory-end-of-period monetary field agrees  with  the  computed  price-out  of  related  item  records,  WAR-RESERVE-MATL-SPARES-DETAIL and SUPPLY-POINT-DETAIL records, and DIFM detail records with activity  code  C.          Note:    Should  an  out-of-balance  condition  exist,  the  M18  program adjusts the INVENTORY-END-OF-PERIOD field to agree with the price-out of related support records. 9.12.1.2.  End-of-Year  Processing.    As  part  of  the  end-of-fiscal-year  processing,  all monetary  fields  are  zeroed  out,  except  for  the  INVENTORY-END-OF-PERIOD  field.  Each record is self-balancing; that is, the mathematical accuracy is calculated each time the  M18  program  is  run.    Note:    Should  an  out-of-balance  condition  occur,  the  M18 program adjusts the IMR price and accounting correction monetary field to bring the IMR into balance.  Any increase or decrease adjustments are printed on the stock fund IMR list. 9.12.1.3.  Access.  The primary access path for the STOCK-FUND-INV-MGMT record is through the DMS-1100 randomization routine, DMSCALC.  The two parameters that must be initialized before accessing the record are as follows: 9.12.1.3.1.  312-CALC-KEY. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 567 9.12.1.3.2.  STKFD-AREA-NAME. 9.12.1.3.2.1.

This chapter describes and contains the formats for the general support records used in the computer.       Note:     1.  The database records are required.  They may not be altered except  as  permitted  under  program  control  with  an  authorized  input.         2.    The  term  Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) is now the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever DBOF  is used in a systems output, the older term is used to reflect the actual output.  The term will be updated upon system programmatic updates. 11.2.  Inventory Accuracy Record Account B/E Complete Record (501). 11.2.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  the  data  necessary  for  managing  inventory  accounts.

The M10 assigns serial numbers each time the inventory adjustment records are printed and blanked.  The Prep Inventory Accuracy Record, program NGV838/A02, resets the serial numbers to zero during end-of-fiscal-year processing. 3.  Serial numbers are assigned in system designator sequence (such as, 01, A1-A9).  Four positions are reserved for each serial number. 4.  The Sample Inventory Program, program NGV535, assigns serial numbers for sample inventory completion.  The serial numbers are assigned according to the system designator and type account code B/E.  Program NGV838/A02 resets the serial numbers to zero during end-of-fiscal-year processing. 5.  The fix counter will be reset to one each time the inventory adjustment records are blanked by program M10. 6.  Serial numbers for inventory count outputs are assigned by the Inventory Count Program (R12/NGV831).  Serial numbers are reset by the first R12 that is processed on a SBSS processing day. 11.8.

Purpose.  To show the net dollar value of materiel transactions for base-supported organizations.  A separate record must be maintained for each organization (that is, each cost center) for accumulating the expense data at the cost center level.  This record is subsidiary to the  project  fund  management  record  (PFMR),  which  is  usually  at  the  responsibility  center level. 11.14.1.1.  Financial Data.  Each record contains specific financial data.  The fields indicate budget  targets  and  unfunded  due-outs  according  to  supplies  and  equipment,  and  they indicate net issues and due-outs according to the fiscal  year and the element of expense (EEIC).    Organization  cost  center  records  (OCCRs)  100-999,  except  920,  are  the  basic records  for  reporting  obligations  (that  is,  expenses  and  obligated  due-outs)  in  the accounting system for operations (system code BQ). 11.14.1.2.  Organization  Information.    Besides  containing  financial  data,  this  record contains certain constant organization descriptive information such as parcel post address and force activity designator. 11.14.1.3.  Loading  Responsibilities.    Since  this  record  contains  both  financial  data  and organization descriptive information, loading the correct data is a joint responsibility of the Supply and A&F functions.  Specifically, the responsibilities are as follows: Table 11.13.  Loading Responsibilities.

This record is used by the reports analysis program.  Program NGV898A sets all report run flags to a value of three as each job is completed.  Program NGV898A uses a value which is prepositioned by the application/utility program (NGV801A for mandatory daily reports), to determine which run flag to set.  Program NGV898C blanks daily report run flags when the RPTEON input is processed.  Program NGV898C blanks monthly report run flags when the specific monthly management data report is processed.     Note:   Report run flags are not necessarily in report processing sequence. 11.16.1.1.  Access.  The REPORTS-SEQUENCE-CONTROL record does not participate as  an  owner  or  member  of  any  set.

To  identify  rejected  and  suspended  transactions  for  daily  listing  and management action.  The Reject and Restore Program, program NGV215A, builds and stores a DAILY-REJECT-SUSPENSE record for each rejected transaction.  The Cumulative Reject Processor, D818 (as outlined in AFH 23-122, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7), establishes a record for each rejected  image  deleted  from  the  database.    These  records  are  printed  by  the  Base  Supply Surveillance  Report  (D20/NGV821)  during  end-of-day  processing.    Part  eight  of  the  D20 report lists records reflecting 301 rejects; whereas, part nine lists those rejects deleted by D818. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 648 11.17.1.1.  Access.

The 20 occurrences of 625-CT-WSE-SRD-TABLE provide a directory of the 20 standard reporting designators (SRDs), controlling the collection and storage of the WEAPON-SUPRT-EFFECTIVENESS (603) records.  The first 10 SRDs in the 625-CT-WSE-SRD-TABLE field will indicate those weapon support effectiveness data records to be downloaded and reported to ILS-S Program Office  and/or MAJCOM during end-of-month processing.  No other load sequence requirements apply within the 625-CT-WSE-SRD-TABLE field.  The presence of a given SRD in this table field will signal the collection of the respective weapon support effectiveness data.  Any number of SRDs, from none (0) to a maximum of 20, can be loaded in this table field(If no SRD is loaded, no weapon support effectiveness data will be collected and all associated data will be collected and reported under the Customer Support Effectiveness Category of data.) 4.  The 15 occurrences of 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE provide a directory of the master reporting organization (MRO) codes for which the appropriate repair cycle management data (REPAIR-CYCLE-ASSET-CONTROL (607) record) will be collected as designated by the 15 occurrences of the 625-CT-COLLECTIVE-ORGS table within each occurrence of the 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE.  Those MRO codes specified will signal and direct the data collection of the respective repair cycle management data and all other repair cycle management data not identified within these tables will be collected under the 'ALL OTHER' category.  All 15 MRO codes in the 625-CT-REPCYC-TABLE field, in addition to the 'ALL OTHER' category, will indicate the associated data records to be downloaded and reported to ILS-S Program Office, Gunter Annex, and/or MAJCOM during end-of-month processing.

Any number of MRO codes, from none (0) to a maximum of 15, can be loaded in this table field.  If no MRO code is loaded, no specified repair cycle management data will be collected and all associated data will be collected and reported under the 'ALL OTHER' category. 5.  The 15 occurrences of the 625-CT-COLLECTIVE-ORGS provide a collection of organization codes to identify those organizations to have repair cycle management data collected under the associated MRO code. 6.  The 20 occurrences of 625-CT-MICAP-TABLE provide a directory of the 20 Standard Reporting Designators (SRDs), controlling the collection and storage of the MICAP-ANALYSIS (609) record.  The MICAP analysis data will be collected as directed by the 20 specified SRDs.  Also, in addition to the 20 specific SRDs, data will be collected under the SRD of 'ZZZ' and all other associated data will be collected under 'other', identified with the '999' identifier.  All SRDs in the 625-CT-MICAP-TABLE field, in addition to the SRD 'ZZZ' and the '999' identifier, will indicate the associated data records to be downloaded and reported to ILS-S Program Office, Gunter Annex, and/or MAJCOM during end-of-month processing.  No load sequence requirements apply within the 625-CT-MICAP-TABLE field.  The presence of a given SRD in this table field will signal the collection of the respective associated data.  Any number of SRDs, from none (0) to a maximum of 20, can be loaded in this table field (If no SRD is loaded, all associated data will be collected and reported under the 'ZZZ' and '999' identifiers.) 12.26.

This chapter provides the following data:  The format of the transaction history record (Para 14.3); the standard print positions of the transaction/document register (Para 14.4); the  transaction  history  exception  records  cross-reference  index;  and  the  transaction  history exception records arranged as paragraphs to this section.       Notes:      1.  The database records are  required.    They  may  not  be  altered  except  as  permitted  under  program  control  with  an authorized  input.    The  techniques  used  to  locate  all  SBSS  database  records  are  contained  in Chapter  3.                  2.    The  term  Materiel  Support  Division  (MSD)  is  now  the  Consolidated Sustainment Activity Group-Supply (CSAG-S). However, in this chapter wherever MSD is used in a systems output, the older term is used to reflect the actual output.  The term will be updated upon system programmatic updates.          3.  The term Defense Business Operations Fund (DBOF) is now the Defense Working Capital Fund (DWCF). However, in this chapter wherever DBOF  is used  in  a  systems  output,  the  older  term  is  used  to  reflect  the  actual  output.    The  term  will  be updated upon system programmatic updates. 14.2.  Consolidated Transaction History Records. 14.2.1.  Included in this chapter are the record formats for the consolidated transaction history (CTH) process. (CTH  records  are  Para  14.102 through  Para  14.112)  These records differ from the 901-TRANSACTION-HISTORY record as stated below: 14.2.1.1.  All transactions are maintained in the CTH area of the SBLC and are backed up on tape.  Users can query CTH transactions through a Master Inquiry Menu.  (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 4, for details on how to use the CTH inquiry process.)  All document control records (DCRs) are stored on the SBLC.  The DCRs are cleared through personal computer interface. 14.2.2.  All delinquent source documents are stored on the SBLC and cleared through personal computer interface. 14.3.  Transaction History Record (901). 14.3.1.  Purpose.  To indicate that updating of records has been completed.  Transaction history records  are  evidence  of  completed  updating,  and  are  used  to  prepare  Transaction  and Document  Control  Registers  and  the  Accounting  and  Finance  Listings.    In  addition,  they provide  a  method  of  statistical  gathering  that  is  essential  to  management  at  all  levels  of command.  Transaction history records are created only during the inline or twilight processing modes. 14.3.1.1.  Access.    This  record  is  accessed  via  DMSCALC  using  the  901-CALC-KEY, which consists of the following: 14.3.1.1.1.  For National stock numbers. 14.3.1.1.1.1.

This transaction history record is created only for application code changes when the type stock record account code is K, and only when the first position of the application code is being changed to or from R. a.  If the first position has been changed from R to N, ammunition transaction code 91 is stored in  the application code field of this transaction history.  b.  If the first position is changed from N to R, 92 will be in this field.  c.  All transaction histories with 91 or 92 in the application code field have an A in the demand code field, zeros in the ending balance and action quantity field, and blanks in the extended cost field.   2.  If the unit price multiplied by the affected balance results in the extended cost overflowing eight positions, the action quantity is reduced and multiple transaction histories are created in sufficient number to prevent an overflow reject.  When this occurs, the quantity in the DCR (if output) will not agree with the quantity on the corresponding warehouse change document (if printed).  See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for management notice F306. 3.  If the type detail code is V, then the vehicle registration number is in this field. 4.  This field is used for item record transaction histories (type A) to accumulate the extended cost of due-in details for automatic materiel acquisition control record (MACR) interface.  This occurs when budget code changes require the migration of funds between MACR. 5.  During the migration of funds to budget codes 1 and 9, the TTPC 3U type demand code A transaction history contains the dollar value of the net increase computed as follows for the affected stock number:   a.  Current Processing Date - DOFD = Divisor.  (If less than 180, make it 180.) b.  Current Recurring Demands = Dividend. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1004 c.  Divisor into Dividend = QTN (DDR).

See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 7 for the management notice F306. 4.  This entry applies only to items migrating to, from, or within divisions of the SMAG and to due-in detail transaction histories.  If the migration decreases the orders-placed field of the appropriate MACR, the 901-MAT-CAT-SOS-CODE field must contain K.  If the net change is an increase, the 901-MAT-CAT-SOS-CODE field must contain J. 5.  If the type detail code is V, then the vehicle registration number is in positions 1-8 of the redefined 901-MARK-FOR field. 6.  If the TTPC is 3Y, then this field contains the change-to stock number.  If the TTPC is 3V, then this field contains the change-from stock number.  If TTPC 3V or 3Y, and TRIC is FIC that was created as a result of processing program NGV441, then this field will contain the 250 serial number. 7.  The 901-FILLER-5 contains the 901-ACTION-QTY multiplied by the 022-FILLER-2 (Extended MAC). 8.  Cost field values, if applicable. Table 14.95.  Cost Field Values.

The last four positions of this field will contain the date of last obligation from the due-out detail. 2.  Transaction histories which have a type DEMAND-CODE of M or E and an activity code of Z will contain the Julian date from the applicable detail record (positions 7-10 of the document number field). 3.  If the Non Stock Fund (NSF) materiel acquisition record adjustment (MACR) (BC Z) is updated or a MACR is processed, then this field will contain the MACR update.  Otherwise, this field will be blank. 4.  The vehicle registration number occurs in these positions when the type detail code is V. 5.  The eight-character conversion factor should have a decimal placed after the fourth digit.  Quantities are adjusted by using the conversion factor as a multiplier.  The result is half adjusted adding .5000 to it AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1390 and dropping the digits to the right of the decimal in the final sum.  For example, if the unit of issue is changed from EA (each) to DZ (dozen), use the following computation:              144 (quantity to be converted)             Multiply by 0000.0833 (conversion factor)             .0432             .432             11.52             11.99522 (result)             Add to half adjust .5000             12.4952 (final sum)             Drop characters after decimal (12 converted quantity) 6.  If the materiel acquisition control record (MACR) has been adjusted, this field will contain the net change.  This net change applies only to the net value changes affecting due-in details. a.  If the input is for a price change, this net change will be contained in the item record  transaction history (DEMAND code A). b.  If the input is for both unit of issue and price changes, the net change will be contained in a  due-in detail transaction history.  Due-in detail transaction histories are written only when the input is for both unit of issue and price changes. 7.  Reason why code J is assigned to indicate data changes on the SNUD stocklist.  If there are no SNUD changes, this field will be blank. 8.  If the input is for unit price changes (budget code 9), only a net price increase will be computed for the affected stock value.  The following formula is used:              Current Processing Date - DOFD = Divisor (round smaller values to 180)             Current Recurring DEMAND= Dividend             Divisor into Dividend = QTN (DDR) (Decimal alignment is maintained and the first              three positions from decimal placement are used at the DDR.)             QTN (DDR) X 365 = Annual Result.             Annual Result X Dollar Value Only - Old Price = Result A             Annual Result X Dollar Value Only - New Price = Result B             Result B - Result A = Net Price Increase - Annual.  (If net price increase is negative, the              positions of the type A DEMAND-CODE code transaction history will contain zeros.  If              the net price increase is positive, these positions will contain the computed dollar value. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1391 9.  Cost field values, if applicable. Table 14.238.

General. 15.1.1.  SURGE (Program UTL003) is a tool for the local user of the SBSS.  It allows the user to access the database in a read-only mode and perform any function normally provided by a program  language except  writing to the database.  SURGE will primarily be used to  create reports of the information from the database. 15.1.2.  SURGE is a subsystem of the SBSS that provides the users with access to the SBSS database and non-database disk and tape files created by the SBSS for the purpose of creating local management reports. 15.1.3.  Capability  limitations  within  existing  utilities,  command  unique,  and  other  report generator programs, dictated the development of a single program that will: 15.1.3.1.  Handle input and output images. 15.1.3.2.  Handle tape input and output. 15.1.3.3.  Retrieve and format mass storage data (disk). 15.1.3.4.  Handle a complete run with a single program pass. 15.1.3.5.  Reduce manual intervention. 15.1.3.6.  Match, merge and/or multiple sort at predetermined intervals. 15.1.3.7.  Provide a flexible and rapid sort. 15.1.3.8.  Be programmed with ease. 15.1.3.9.  Provide meaningful debugging aids. 15.1.3.10.  Reuse established and tested routines. 15.1.3.11.  Handle large input and output volumes while permitting instruction linkage to perform the complete task. 15.1.3.12.  Be assembled without maintaining a compiler or an assembler. 15.1.3.13.  Perform extensive edits before performing live operations. 15.1.3.14.  Transmit output data to Rolling Line Printer (RLP) or Satellite. 15.1.4.  Materiel  Management  personnel  at  all  levels  should  become  familiar  with  the capabilities of this program.  All personnel directly involved with the operations of the SBSS must possess a detailed working knowledge and the skills necessary to prepare, interpret, and process UTL003 program language style. 15.1.5.  Supervisors must ensure personnel are fully trained and skilled in accomplishing these tasks.    Base-level  classroom  training  environment  is  highly  recommended  and  should  be utilized where possible. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1554 15.1.6.  SURGE programs designed to make input images for subsequent online input should be processed to take advantage of the pseudo reader. 15.2.  Documentation.  There  are  three  categories  of  SURGE  programs  each  requiring  its  own type of documentation. 15.2.1.  Mandatory  Utilities.    These  are  utility  programs  directed  by  this  manual.    Maintain program run instructions in the format of section 15B in a program jacket file within Computer Operations.  At the discretion of the MAJCOM, program jacket files could be assigned local program numbers and listed to show the dates the requirement is to be processed.  Recommend using the assigned control number as the program identification.  This will facilitate scheduling and  product  review  requirements.    The  as-required  utility  programs  may  be  published  in  a supplement by the functional activity, or an AF Form 2011 will be filed in the program jacket file if the product is recurring. 15.2.2.  Local Recurring Utilities.  The functional activity requiring the product may publish a supplement.  Program jacket files will be maintained as described above. 15.2.3.  Local Nonrecurring Utilities.  Record run instructions in block 16 (and reverse side when necessary) of the initiating AF Form 2011.  These programs do not require formal run instructions or documentation. Section 15B—-SURGE Program Preparation and Run Instructions 15.3.  Overview.  SURGE  provides  a  general  purpose  programming  capability  for  the  SBSS without the need for a separate compiler. 15.4.  Program  Logic.  SURGE  reads  the  program  instruction  images  prepared  by  the  user, translates  them  into  a  tokenized  program,  and  then  acts  as  an  executive  system  to  process  the generated program.  The instruction repertoire provided allows the user to write a program with the following input and output options within a single program: 15.4.1.  Input. 15.4.1.1.  RPS. 15.4.1.2.  Tape Unit. 15.4.1.3.  Mass Storage File (Disk). 15.4.2.  Sort.  Multiple sorting is allowed. 15.4.3.  Output. 15.4.3.1.  Printer. 15.4.3.2.  RPS. 15.4.3.3.  Mass Storage File (Disk). 15.5.

Include  all  peripheral  file  identification  and distribution instructions.  All database areas have to be up or SURGE will abort. 15.7.  Management  Uses.  This  program  can  be  used  to  satisfy  all  nonstandard  SBSS  program requirements. Section 15C—-Error Message Definitions 15.8.  General. 15.8.1.  When  SURGE  runs  and  an  abnormal  condition  is  detected,  an  error  message  is generated and printed on the "PR" listing.  These messages explain the nature of the problem, who (user or AFMC SCM-R INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITY) can remedy it, and in many cases what the remedy is. 15.8.2.  There  are  three  classes  of  errors,  "Warnings",  "Serious",  and  "Fatal."    Generally, "Serious" and "Fatal" errors will cause program termination, while "Warnings" are basically information about troublesome, but not deadly errors. 15.8.2.1.  Warning.  Program will run with this error. 15.8.2.2.  Serious.  Program could run but with no assurance of correctness so program is terminated. 15.8.2.3.  Fatal.  Program cannot run as control is totally lost.  Program is terminated. 15.9.  Specifics. 15.9.1.  SURGE runs in two stages:  (1) the compile (Tokenize) stage and, (2) the execution stage.  The messages and their formats are different for each stage. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1556 15.9.2.  The compile stage converts the SURGE source code into executable tokens which are then written to the "Work Token File" (WTF).  The errors in this stage are variable form, plain text messages, and are not explained here.  The general form may include underlining (with x's) a word (in the source code) in question and then proceeding with an explanation of what was "expected" and what was "found".  The solution is often inferred by the "expected" phrase. 15.9.3.  The  execution  stage  reads  the  "Work  Token  File"  (WTF)  and  executes  the  tokens interpretively.  Para 15.25 illustrates the form and contents of the messages that come from the  execute  stage.    All  of  these  messages  are  in  "plain"  text,  but  not  all  are  in  "clear"  text.  Those messages that are not clear are further explained, along with corrective action/s to take. Section 15D—-Debugging Aids 15.10.  $SCREEN.  $SCREEN  is  an  active  receiving  field.    When  data  is  moved  here,  as  in, "MOVE expression TO $SCREEN;", $SCREEN will be moved to the PRINT$ file.  In Demand, the  PRINT$  file  is  the  terminal  screen  and  optionally  the  side-by  printer.    Moving  data  to $SCREEN in Demand allows the user to monitor events as they happen.  In Batch, the PRINT$ file  is  moved  to  "PR"  file  by  default,  or  is  redirected  by  the  @SYM  image  (2nd  image  in  the @START runstream) to a file of choice where it can be monitored (@ED,R) during execution.  Moving data in Batch allows debugging messages to be printed without corrupting the actual print file being created.  Move to $SCREEN should be used in lieu of DISPLAY for debugging. 15.10.1.  $SCREEN messages are 80 characters long, but the first three positions are reserved for  the  literal  "TL:".    "TL:"  is  an  acronym  for  TEST  LINE  and  identifies  the  source  of  the output line.  These three characters subtract from the available space, leaving 77 characters for the output message (data).  Move no more than 77 characters to $SCREEN. 15.10.2.  $SCREEN is a SDDN and as such can be accessed as a source of data as in:  "MOVE $SCREEN TO HLD-AREA;". 15.10.3.  $SCREEN  is  a  self-clearing  area  when  not  partialed.    There  is  no  need  to  clear  it before  using  it.    When  data  is  moved  to  $SCREEN,  it  is  printed  and  then  cleared,  unless $SCREEN  is  partialed.    If  $SCREEN  is  partialed,  as  in  "MOVE  expression  TO $SCREEN[5,10];", the data is placed into $SCREEN in positions 5 through 10, and is printed but not cleared.  The following coding: 15.10.3.1.  MOVE  1 TO #RN; 15.10.3.2.  MOVE ‘  RECORD NUMBER = ‘ & #RN TO $SCREEN[1,19]; 15.10.3.3.  LOOP:  REPEAT . . . . . . . 15.10.3.4.  MOVE #RN + 1 TO #RN; 15.10.3.5.  MOVE #RN TO $SCREEN[19,19]; 15.10.3.6.  LOOP:  END 15.10.3.7.  would create formatted print as follows: 15.10.3.8.  TL:  RECORD NUMBER = 1 15.10.3.9.  TL:  RECORD NUMBER = 2 AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1557 15.10.3.10.  TL:  RECORD NUMBER = 3 15.10.4.  $SCREEN can be used in  Demand in  conjunction  with  READ$-FILE to  create an interactive  program.    $SCREEN  is  also  used  to  instruct  SURGE  to  do  special  debugging operation.  They are: 15.10.4.1.  TRACE - Which allows a token-by-token view of the internal processing with corresponding values of each data item being moved to PRINT$. 15.10.4.2.  DUMP - Which gives an unformatted dump of the AN-area and/or its INDEX.  It allows a view of what data is in the AN-area and where it is in that area (not operational). 15.11.  Trace.  Trace  allows  a  token-by-token  view  of  the  internal  processing  with  the corresponding value of each data item being moved to PRINT.  Trace can produce a vast amount of print and should be turned on just before the code in question and turned off just after.  Trace can  be  turned  on/off  an  unlimited  number  of  times  without  effecting  the  results  of  normal processing.  Trace can be used to see the data being processed, decided upon, and created during execution.             A trace can be activated by:                        "MOVE TRACE ON TO $SCREEN;".                                 deactivated by:                        "MOVE TRACE OFF TO $SCREEN;".             When a trace is started,                  PRINT$ will begin with:                        "TL:TRACE ON"                           and is followed by:                        One or more formatted lines. 15.11.1.  Token Fetch Line. Figure 15.1.  Token Fetch Line. 15.11.2.  Hold Line. 15.11.2.1.  "HOLD PREVIOUS TOKEN" 15.11.2.2.

The  token  being  held  in  “hold  status”  (see  Hold  Line  above)  can  now  be removed from “hold status” and considered for processing.  It may be put in "hold status" again. 15.11.4.

One  occurrence,  or  the  first occurrence,  is  always  the  RIGHT  operand;  the  second  is  the  LEFT  operand.    This  also occurs during a STORE (the results of the word "TO" as in the verb phrase: 15.11.6.1.1.  "MOVE expression TO X;"). 15.11.7.

Two  types  of  unformatted  dumps  are  possible;  the  Alphanumeric  Area  and/or  its Index.  An unformatted dump does not list data names along with the data, and is not selective in  what  is  printed.   An  unformatted dump  does  list  the entire area in  question with  address locations down the left side.  The  address  location is  the address  of the first character on a given dump line and is always zero relative. 15.12.1.1.  The following instruction will dump the Alphanumeric Area: 15.12.1.1.1.  “MOVE DUMP AN AREA TO $SCREEN;” 15.12.1.2.  The following instruction will dump the Alphanumeric Index: 15.12.1.2.1.  "MOVE DUMP AN-INDX TO $SCREEN;" 15.12.1.3.  A sample dump line follows: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1560 Figure 15.7.  Sample DUMP AN-AREA Line.  15.12.2.  All "null characters" (no data) are printed as "*".  All asterisks are printed as asterisks. 15.12.3.  All  alphanumeric  literals  start  at  the  end  of  the  area  (address  16383)  and  work backwards toward the front of memory (address 8192). 15.12.4.  This dump is useful when a large number of data items, or large tables begin to fill up most of the available alphanumeric space.  It can be used for memory management planning. 15.12.5.  Another  use  for  this  dump  occurs  when  a  large  number  of  unexpected "AUTOMATIC ALPHA-NUM AREA PACKS" are indicated.  Here are the conditions: 15.12.5.1.  A  SURGE  program  is  written  without  partials,  but  instead  with  catenations.  This  results  in  very  little  code  if  done  right,  and  is  a  good  technique.    However,  on processing sufficient data, the A/N area will fragment and fill up.  SURGE will then go into an AUTOMATIC A/N AREA PACK.  This does not take long, and is acceptable on a medium amount of data.  For this style of program, AUTOMATIC A/N AREA PACK is expected and is not a problem. 15.12.5.2.  A  SURGE  program  is  written  with  partials  specifically  to  eliminate  memory fragmentation.    If  memory  does  fragment  and  fill  up,  it  is  an  error  and  detection  of  the offending data item  is  desired.  This  can be detected by taking  a dump  of the A/N area before it packs.  On the dump, look for the data that is moving away from all other data, towards a high address. 15.12.5.3.  A  SURGE  program  is  written  with  partials  specifically  to  eliminate  memory fragmentation.  In this case, memory does not fragment but simply fills up because of too much data.  An A/N Area dump may reveal which data to DROP to free more space. 15.12.6.  "MOVE  ‘DUMP  AN-INDX’  TO  $SCREEN;"  will  cause  a  dump  of  the Alphanumeric  Index.    This  index  is  the  link  between  a  Data  token  and  the  A/N  Area.    To identify Alphanumeric Data Tokens, consider the following token format examples: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1561 Figure 15.8.  Sample TOKEN Format No 1. Figure 15.9.  Sample TOKEN Format No 2.  Figure 15.10.  Sample TOKEN Format No 3. Figure 15.11.  Sample TOKEN Format No 4.    AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1562 Figure 15.12.  Sample TOKEN Format No 5. 15.12.7.  In each alphanumeric data token, the last number points to the Alphanumeric Index.  This dumped index consists of four columns of numbers.  The breakdown of each column is as follows:  Figure 15.13.  Sample DUMP AN-INDX Entry Type No 1. Figure 15.14.  Sample DUMP AN-INDX Entry Type No 2.   AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1563 Figure 15.15.  Sample DUMP AN-INDX Entry Type No 3. 15.13.  Source Program Input. 15.13.1.  Purpose.  To define the source program inputs.  15.13.1.1.  Source  Versus  Tokenized  Programs.    Source  programs  are  the  actual instructions  written  by  the  programmer,  usually  stored  in  elements  within  programs generated by the SURGE processor from source programs, and contain the program in a form executable by SURGE.  They are usually stored in elements within program files but may also be stored in data files.  Tokenized programs previously created by SURGE may be executed directly, bypassing the tokenization process.  Therefore, all programs must be retokenized on the next run following the release of a new data dictionary. 15.13.1.2.  Source  Input  Format.   Program  constructs  and verb phrases are delimited by colons, semicolons, and key reserved words.  Therefore, there are no restrictions as to how the source program is formatted into individual input images.  A single program construct or verb phrase may span as many or as few input images as desired, or a single input image (1 line) may contain as many program constructs and verb phrases that will fit.  Anywhere a single space is allowed (or required), any number of spaces may be coded.  This allows the programmer to format for readability. 15.13.1.3.  Input Images.  Each input image may be up to 80 characters.  An input image is  ended  by  the  physical  end  of  the  input  image  or  by  a  percent  sign  (%)  preceded  and followed  by  a  space.    Anything  following  the  percent  sign  is  treated  as  a  comment.  EXCEPTION:  Percent signs within alphanumeric literals or within REM verb phrases do not end the input image.  Input images may not have a question mark (?) or an at sign (@) in column 1. 15.13.1.4.  Continuation of Words Between Input Images.  Words may not be continued from one input image to the next except for alphanumeric literals.  An alphanumeric literal may be continued on more than one input image according to these rules: 15.13.1.4.1.  The alphanumeric literal is opened on the first input image with a single quote (') and continues to the physical end of the input image. 15.13.1.4.2.  The literal  is  continued on the next input image with  the first  character following the first single quote on that image.  Anything before the first single quote is ignored.  The literal will continue if necessary until the end of that image literal. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1564 15.13.1.4.3.  The  literal  will  be  terminated  by  the  second  stand-alone  (not  back-to-back) single quote on the same image. 15.13.1.4.4.  Care should be used to ensure back-to-back single quotes (indicates one single  quote  within  the  literal)  appear  on  the  same  input  image  to  avoid misinterpretation. 15.13.1.5.  Using the Surge Processor in a Runstream. 15.13.1.5.1.  The SURGE processor is executed in a runstream the same as any other SBSS batch program.  The XQT of NGV801A will be followed by the SURGE select image, the local SURGE program instructions, and optional data.  The format is: Figure 15.16.  Runstream. 15.13.1.6.  The  source  program  specifies  the  name  of  the  file  or  element  containing  the source-program  instructions.    The  tokenized  program  contains  the  name  of  the  file  or element to contain the tokenized program instructions.  The options are one or more of the following letters without spaces between them and have the following meanings:  15.13.1.6.1.  I - The program instructions immediately follow the SURGE select image and are ended with an image containing STOP in the first four positions and nothing else in the remaining positions.  The source-program field may or may not be used.  If it is used, these instructions (without the STOP) will be placed in that element or file.  If an I is not specified, the source program instructions are assumed to be in the file or element which must be given in the source-program field.  Do not use with the X option. 15.13.1.6.2.  L  -  Produces  a  long  listing  which  includes  the  program  source  code, executable tokens and error messages.  Overrides S and N options.  Do not use with X. 15.13.1.6.3.  N - Produces no listing of the program.  Identifies errors by listing only those lines that are in error and all associated error messages.  Do not use with X. 15.13.1.6.4.  S - Produces a short listing of program source code and errors messaged only.  Overrides N, and do not use with X. 15.13.1.6.5.  T - Tokenize the program only.  Do not execute.  Do not use with X. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1565 15.13.1.6.6.  X - Executes a previously tokenized program.  Does not tokenize.  The source-program field is ignored, the tokenized-program field must be given, and the file or element must contain a tokenized program.  This is a stand-alone option and is not to be used with any other option. 15.13.1.6.7.  Y - Suppresses the printing of warnings. 15.13.1.6.8.  Z - Reserved for internal use only.  DO NOT USE. 15.13.1.7.  Syntax Rules for Surge Select Image. 15.13.1.7.1.  UTL003SURGE  must  be  the  first  11  positions  of  the  select  image.  Positions 20-50 are for program identification. 15.13.1.7.2.  If options are given, UTL003SURGE must be immediately followed by a comma, zero, or more spaces.  The options must be back-to-back, and at least one space must follow the last option.  The comma is not to be used if no options are given. 15.13.1.7.3.  The  source  program  and  tokenized  program  (if  given)  must  be  a  fully qualified file or fully qualified element names.  If these names lack a qualifier or file name, then standard defaults will be used.  Be completely familiar with defaults before using them. 15.13.1.7.4.  When using both the source program and tokenized program fields, they must be separated from the options (or from UTL003 SURGE) by at least one space.  They are separated with a comma followed by "zero or more" (0 or more) spaces.  There will be no space before the comma. 15.13.1.7.5.  When using just the source-program field, it must be separated from the previous field by at least one space.  The comma and tokenized-program field must be omitted. 15.13.1.7.6.  When using just the tokenized-program field, it must be separated from the previous field by one or more spaces, a comma, and zero or more spaces. 15.13.1.8.  Runstream Considerations. 15.13.1.8.1.  If the I option is used, the program instructions must follow the SURGE select image.  The instructions must be followed with an image containing only STOP in the first four positions. 15.13.1.8.2.  If the program reads READ$ file, this file of data images is placed either behind the SURGE select image, or behind the first STOP image if the I option is used.  These images are also followed with a STOP image. 15.13.1.8.3.  The sequence of images is terminated with the image ??STOP in the first six  positions.    The  image  is  required  whether  or  not  instructions  or  data  follow  the SURGE select image. 15.13.1.8.4.  Care should be taken to ensure that STOP or ??ST do not appear in the first  four  positions  of  the  instructions  or  data  image  to  prevent  them  from  being interpreted as runstream control images. 15.14.  Language Concepts. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1566 15.14.1.  Purpose.  To define the SURGE language concepts. 15.14.1.1.  Data Representation in Surge.  There are four types of data names which may be  represented  in  a  SURGE  program.   Alphanumeric-User-Defined-Data-Names, Numeric-User-Defined-Data-Names,  Database  Data  Names,  and  SURGE-defined  Data Names. 15.14.1.2.  User-Defined-Data-Names  (UDDN).    These  items  are  ALPHANUMERIC-USER-DEFINED-DATA-NAMES  or  NUMERIC-USER-DEFINED-DATA-NAMES.  When "UDDN" appears in the programming skeletons, the programmer may use either. 15.14.1.2.1.  Alphanumeric User-Defined-Data-Name (ANUDDN). 15.14.1.2.1.1.  Description.    These  items  are  used  to  store  data  needed  by  the program.  Some calculations and totaling can be accomplished on any string that can be converted to numbers.  The lengths of these items are variable and are set each time data is moved to them according to the length of the data moved.  The maximum  length  is  132  characters.    The  programmer  may  define  up  to  512 alphanumeric data items which may use up to a total of 8,192 characters in memory.  Indexed items (items defined with a DIMENSION verb) use more than one of the available  512  data  items.    To  compute  the  number  used,  add  1  to  the  integer specified in the DIMENSION verb phrase.  Memory space used by alphanumeric user-defined  data  items  is  assigned  as  it  is  required.    If  the  memory  space  used exceeds  8,192  characters,  the  program  will  error-terminate  (the  acronym ANUDDN is used throughout this chapter). 15.14.1.2.1.2.  Composition.    These  data  names  can  be  up  to  16  characters  long from  this  set  of  characters:    0-9,  A-Z,  -,  #,  $.    ANUDDN  must  begin  with  an alphabetic character (A-Z) and cannot end with a hyphen (-). 15.14.1.2.2.  Numeric-User-Defined-Data-Name (NUDDN). 15.14.1.2.2.1.  Description.  These names are used to store numeric values and to do calculations and totaling with the least amount of internal processing.  They have the fixed format of a sign, nine digits for the whole number, an assumed decimal point, and seven digits for the fractional portion.  The user may define up to 256 numeric items.  Subscripted items use as many of these 256 items as specified by the integer in the DIMENSION verb phrase. 15.14.1.2.2.2.  Composition.  These names can be up to  16 characters long from this set of characters:  0-9, A-Z, -, #, $.  NUDDN must begin with a pound sign (#) and cannot end with a hyphen(-). 15.14.1.2.3.  Data-Base-Data-Name (DBDN). 15.14.1.2.3.1.  Description.    These  names  are  already  defined  in  the  system's database schema.  Once a record has been read, the programmer can reference the data within the record using the names as defined in the schema.  Care should be taken to reference computational (binary) items as elementary items rather than as group items.  The SURGE processor deals with data in display (printable) mode and automatically translates from computational to display when a computational data  item  is  reference  "d".    Moving  a  group  item  containing  a  computational AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1567 elementary  item  will  cause  the  entire  item  to  be  treated  as  alphanumeric  and, therefore, no translation will be done (the acronym DBDN is used throughout this chapter). 15.14.1.2.3.2.  Composition.  Any data name defined within the SURGE program's view of the database may be used by the programmer.  These names are written exactly as they are defined in the database and begin with the 3-digit record number and  a  dash  (nnn-).    EXCEPTION:    Record  names  are  defined  in  the  database without the record number in the first three positions of the name.  To use these names in a SURGE program, the programmer must use the name as defined in the database  preceded  with  the  3-position  record  number  and  a  slash  (nnn/).    For example, the record defined as ITEM-RECORD in the database must be written as 101/ITEM-RECORD in the SURGE program. 15.14.1.2.4.  Surge-Defined-Data-Name (SDDN). 15.14.1.2.4.1.  Description.  These items are alphanumeric and have fixed lengths.  They can hold both numeric and/or alphanumeric type data, but the numeric data will be in string (alphanumeric) format.  In general, they are used to pass constant information (such as base name, etc.) to the local SURGE program.  They can also be  used  to  pass  information  from  the  local  SURGE  program  to  the  SURGE processor to direct execution of the local SURGE program.  SURGE-defined data items  can  be  used  to  specify  database  record  keys  to  tell  the  SURGE  processor which record to read, to specify data to be converted, to specify headers, trailers, and  other  report  formatting  information,  etc.    The  acronym  SDDN  is  used throughout this chapter. Section 15E—-SURGE-Defined Data Names 15.15.  SURGE-Defined Data Names. 15.15.1.  Purpose.  To define the SURGE system reserved variables. Table 15.1.  SURGE-Defined Data Names.

Skeletons and Rules. 15.16.1.  Purpose.  To define skeletons and their rules. 15.16.2.  Skeleton.  A skeleton is a picture of the arrangement of the elemental items that make up a program construct or verb phrase.  As a general rule, these elements or groups of elements, must be coded in the sequence in which they appear in the skeleton.  Exceptions to this rule will be stated following the skeleton. 15.16.3.  Syntax Rules.  Further define the order in which elements or groups of elements may appear.    It  also  places  restrictions  on  values  of  elements  which  may  be  supplied  by  the programmer. 15.16.4.  General  Rules.    Clarifies  the  effect  an  element  or  group  of  elements  have  on  the tokenization and execution processes. 15.16.5.  Brackets.    Brackets  [],  in  the  skeleton  indicate  the  portion  included  within  the brackets is optional. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1572 15.16.6.  Braces.  Braces {}, in the skeleton indicate one and only one of the options within the braces must be included within the program construct or verb phrase. 15.16.7.  Double Bars.  Double bars || || , indicate one or more of the options within the double bars must be included within the program construct or verb phrase.  Unless otherwise specified, the options must appear in the order they appear in the skeleton. 15.16.8.  Ellipsis.  Ellipsis  (. . .) indicates the last  bracketed [], or braced {}, portion of the skeleton  may  be  repeated  at  the  programmer's  option.    The  syntax  rules  will  specify  any limitations on the number of repetitions. 15.16.9.  Semicolons.  Semicolons (;) appear at the end of each verb phrase skeleton. 15.16.10.  Words  Used  In  Skeletons.    There  are  three  types  of  words  used  in  skeletons:  programmer supplied words, key reserved words, and reserved words. 15.16.10.1.  Programmer Supplied Words.  These words are in lower case and are to be replaced by the programmer with a syntactically correct entry as described in this manual. 15.16.10.2.  Key Reserved Words.  These are reserved words that are underlined within the skeleton.  They must be coded by the programmer exactly where shown and may appear nowhere else.  Special characters that are used for operators (+, -, *, /, =, <, >, <=, =>, <>,) are considered to be key reserved words even though they are not underlined when used in a skeleton.  Reserved words are capitalized within the skeleton.  Optional Reserved words add readability to the program.  When used, they must be coded exactly where shown in the skeleton and may not appear anywhere else. Table 15.3.  Reserved Words.

Filenames.  These are internal filenames reserved by SURGE to identify its disk and tape files. Table 15.4.  Disk and Tape Internal Filenames. DISK FILES  TAPE FILES  TRANS TAPE FILE  INPUT FILE DISK-1 DISK-2 DISK-3 DISK-4 DISK-5 TAPE-1 TAPE-2    15.16.12.  Construct Names. TRANS-TAPE READ$-FILE          15.16.12.1.  Description.  These names identify the beginnings, endings, and divisions of program constructs.  There are two special types of construct names:  the program name, which appears on the first line of the program and subroutine names which appear on the first line of a subroutine. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1574 15.16.12.2.  Composition.  Construct names are up to 16 characters.  They contain any of the characters A-Z, 0-9, and hyphen.  They cannot begin or end with a hyphen and must conform to the same standards as ANUDDN.  They must end with a colon (:), except when used in a DO statement or a QUIT statement.  In these two statements, they are part of verb phrase which ends with a semicolon. 15.16.12.3.  Literals.    Literals  allow  the  user  to  define  constant  data.    An  alphanumeric literal  uses  up  one  of  the  allowable  512  alphanumeric  user-defined  data  items  and  a numeric literal uses up one of the 256 numeric user-defined data items. 15.16.12.4.  Numeric Literals.  Numeric literals are used to define fixed numeric values in a program.  They are made up of the characters 0-9, +, -, and decimal point.  The sign (+ or -) can be used only once in the literal and, if used, must be the first character.  There can be one decimal point with up to seven decimal digits on its right and up to nine digits on its left.  There must be at least one digit in a numeric literal.  A fraction, a number smaller than one, (1) must have a zero (0) preceding the decimal (0.25 -vs- .25). 15.16.13.  Alphanumeric  Literals.    Alphanumeric  literals  are  used  to  represent  fixed alphanumeric values in a program.  They begin and end with a single quote (').  Any character in the computer's set may appear in the literal which may be up to 132 characters long.  To represent one single quote within an alphanumeric literal, two quotes must be coded back-to-back. 15.16.13.1.  Condition Names.  Condition names represent a test that can be either true or false(see expressions). 15.16.13.1.1.  DEFAULT                  Same as "1 = 1" or "1" 15.16.13.1.2.  END-OF-FILE            Same as "$STATUS = 9" 15.16.13.1.3.  NO-FIND                    Same as "$STATUS = 8"                 Note:  A GOOD READ IS Same as "$STATUS = 0" Section 15H—-Files 15.16.14.

To define what an EXPRESSION is and what it does. 15.17.2.  Background.  Data processing is concerned with three basic operations: 15.17.2.1.  Input of Data. 15.17.2.2.  Processing Data. 15.17.2.3.  Output of Data. 15.17.2.4.  The processing stage is  concerned with two things:   (1) combining values of variables and constants to get new values and, (2) combining them in the right order.  Part of the ordering or sequencing is controlled by the program constructs detailed elsewhere.  The  rest  of  the  sequencing  control  and  the  actual  combining  is  accomplished  in expressions. 15.17.2.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.17.2.4.1.1.  "MOVE A + B TO C;" 15.17.2.4.2.  In this example, A and B are added and the answer is placed into C.  "A +  B"  is  an  expression.    Expressions  can  range  from  simple,  "A",  to  complex,  "A  + ROOT(B  -  C  /  2)  -  3.5  *  (B  -  C.)."    Expressions  can  be  used  to  determine  a  value, compare one or more values for making decisions (true or false situations), determining order of data (greater than, equal, less than), pulling strings of data apart into smaller strings, concatenating (combining) smaller strings into larger strings (build print lines, phrases)  and  converting  from  one  class  of  data  to  another  (alphanumeric-string  to numeric-value and vice versa).  A working knowledge of FUNCTIONS, INDEXING, PARTIALING,  CONDITION  NAMES,  SEPARATORS,  AND  OPERATORS PRECEDENCE is needed to understand expressions. Section 15I—-Functions 15.18.  Functions. 15.18.1.  Purpose.  To define SURGE Computational Functions. 15.18.2.  Functions.    Just  as  operators  direct  actions  to  be  performed  upon  their  operands, functions direct actions to be performed upon their operands.  Functions can have one or more operands depending upon the function.  SURGE functions have a maximum of two operands.  AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1576 A function can be one of two types; alphanumeric or numeric which is determined by the type of data it puts out.  An alphanumeric function puts out an alphanumeric string even if the string can be read as a number.  A numeric function puts out a numeric-value data item.  The result of all functions is placed on an internal stack and does not modify any input operands. 15.18.3.  Days-Difference Function. 15.18.3.1.  Function.  Computes the difference in days between two Julian dates. 15.18.3.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.17.  DAYS-DIFFERENCE Skeleton. 15.18.3.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton. 15.18.3.4.  General Rules.  15.18.3.4.1.  Expression-1 should evaluate to the earlier Julian date; if not, a negative result will be returned. 15.18.3.4.2.  Expression-2  should  evaluate  to  the  later  Julian  date;  if  not,  a  negative result will be returned. 15.18.3.4.3.  The format of the Julian dates is seven digits:  four for year and three for day.  The year portion may have spaces as the first three characters (i.e., A 4-position Julian date).  In this case, the SURGE processor will assume the decade to be the one that makes the year closest to the current year.  In the event two possible selections will be 5 years away, the earlier date will be used.  The day portion must be between 001 and 365 (or 366 for leap years).  If DAYS-DIFFERENCE fails these edits, an error will result, and the program will be terminated. 15.18.3.4.4.  The  form  of  the  Julian  dates  must  be  an  alphanumeric  string  without decimal points.  Numeric values will contain decimal points (even if assumed) and will cause error termination. 15.18.3.4.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.3.4.4.1.1.  MOVE ‘bbb’ & 202-DATE-SERIAL-NBR[1,4] TO JD; 15.18.3.4.4.1.2.  MOVE DAYS-DIFFERENCE (JD, $SBSS-JULIAN) TO PL WITH EDITING ‘99999’; 15.18.3.4.5.  PRINT PL; 15.18.4.  Length Function. 15.18.4.1.  Function.  Returns the length of an alphanumeric string. 15.18.4.2.  Skeleton. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1577 Figure 15.18.  LENGTH Skeleton.  15.18.4.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton. 15.18.4.4.  General Rules.  The expression must evaluate to an alphanumeric string. 15.18.4.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.4.4.1.1.  MOVE ‘FORBIS’ TO NAME; 15.18.4.4.1.2.  MOVE LENGTH(NAME) TO NAME-LEN; 15.18.4.4.1.3.  MOVE NAME & ‘ HAS ‘ & NAME-LEN & ‘ LETTERS ‘ TO PL; 15.18.4.4.1.4.  PRINT PL; 15.18.4.4.1.5.  (PL would equate to "FORBIS HAS 6 LETTERS") 15.18.5.  Spaces Function. 15.18.5.1.  Function.  Generates specified number of spaces. 15.18.5.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.19.  SPACES Skeleton.  15.18.5.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton. 15.18.5.4.  General Rules.  The expression must resolve to a positive whole number or a string not exceeding 132.  The string will be automatically converted to  a numeric item internally.  If conversion cannot take place, an error will occur. 15.18.5.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.5.4.1.1.  MOVE SPACES(132) TO PRINT-LINE; 15.18.5.4.1.2.  (PRINT-LINE would contain 132 spaces) 15.18.6.  Square Function. 15.18.6.1.  Function.  Calculates the square of a number. 15.18.6.2.  Skeleton.

The expression must evaluate to a numeric value or a number in  alphanumeric  form.    The  string  will  be  automatically  converted  to  a  numeric  item internally.  If conversion cannot take place, an error will occur. 15.18.6.5.  Example. 15.18.6.5.1.  MOVE SQUARE (2) TO FOUR; 15.18.6.5.2.  (the contents of FOUR would be 4) 15.18.7.  Square Root Function. 15.18.7.1.  Function.  Calculate the square root of a number. 15.18.7.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.21.  ROOT Skeleton.  15.18.7.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton. 15.18.7.4.  General Rules.  The expression must evaluate to a numeric value or a number in alphanumeric string form.  The string will automatically be converted to a numeric item internally.  If conversion cannot take place, an error will occur. 15.18.7.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.7.4.1.1.  MOVE ROOT (16) TO FOUR; 15.18.7.4.1.2.  (the contents of FOUR would be 4) 15.18.8.  Unpack Function. 15.18.8.1.  Function.    Internally  converts  the  requested  computational  (packed  binary) number from string format to SURGE internal numeric format. 15.18.8.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.22.  UNPACK Skeleton. 15.18.8.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton. 15.18.8.4.  General Rules.  15.18.8.4.1.  Expression-1 must evaluate to a string containing the packed binary data.  Data in this form is from 1 to 7 characters, and is not in ASCII format.  Therefore, it may not be printable.  A one (1) character packed binary number will unpack to a 1-or 2-digit number, and will appear on a SCHEMA or COBOL file description as PIC 9(2) COMP.  A two (2) character packed binary number will unpack to a 1 through 5 digit number, and will appear on a SCHEMA or COBOL file description as PIC 9(5) COMP.  The following table defines all seven possibilities: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1579 Table 15.6.  General Rules. SIZE OF PACKED MAXIMUM # OF  UNPACKED SCHEMA OR BINARY FIELD DIGITS COBOL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 5 7 10 13 15 18 PIC 9(2) COMP PIC 9(5) COMP PIC 9(7) COMP PIC 9(10) COMP PIC 9(13) COMP PIC 9(15) COMP PIC 9(18) COMP 15.18.8.4.2.  Expression-2 must evaluate to a number from 0 through 7, and represents the positioning of the decimal point in the final number.  Packed binary  numbers do not have a decimal point.  The SURGE user must adjust accordingly.  If a packed field unpacks to 583 with 0 in expression-2, it will unpack to 5.83 with a 2 in expression-2. 15.18.8.4.2.1.  EXAMPLES: 15.18.8.4.2.1.1.  a.  MOVE 205-MARK-FOR [10,14] TO PACKED-DATA; 15.18.8.4.2.1.2.  MOVE UNPACK (PACKED-DATA , 0) TO #UNPACKED-DATA; 15.18.8.4.2.1.3.  b.

MOVE UNPACK (TOTAL-PENNIES , 2) TO #TOTAL-DOLLARS; Section 15J—-Indexing 15.18.9.  Purpose.  To explain Indexing and its uses. 15.18.10.  Indexing.  Indexing is a technique that allows data items containing similar data to have  the  same  name.    A  look-up  table  is  a  good  example.    The  individual  items  would  be distinguished  by  including  an  index  in  parentheses  immediately  after  the  data  name.    In  an example of the month table, a data item MONTH-TAB(1) might contain the data "JAN" while MONTH-TAB(12) might contain the data "DEC". 15.18.10.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.10.1.1.  TABLE(4) 15.18.10.1.2.  A(2) AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1580 15.18.10.1.3.  #B(25) 15.18.10.1.4.  In  order  to  tell  SURGE  the  maximum  size  of  a  user-defined  table,  a DIMENSION  statement  is  provided.    The  DIMENSION  statement  also  identifies  to SURGE which UDDN are tables. 15.18.10.2.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.10.2.1.  DIMENSION TABLE(15) 15.18.10.2.2.  DIMENSION #A(3) 15.18.11.  Syntax Rules. 15.18.11.1.  An indexed UDDN must have been dimensioned or an error will occur. 15.18.11.2.  A UDDN may not be dimensioned greater than 256. 15.18.11.3.  A  DBDN  that  contains  an  occurs  clause  in  the  schema  does  not  need  a dimension statement as they are automatically dimensioned by SURGE.  These items must be referenced with indexing or an error will occur. 15.18.11.4.  SDDN may not be indexed. 15.18.11.5.  Literals may not be indexed. 15.18.11.6.  A data name may not be partialed and indexed at the same time.  An indexed item may be moved to a nonindexed item and then partialed, or a partial may be moved to an indexed item. Section 15K—-Partialing 15.18.12.  Purpose.  To define partials and their uses. 15.18.13.  Partials.    Partials  define  part  of  a  data  item.    If  an  alphanumeric  data  item  is  25 characters and characters 8 through 15 are desired, they may be specified and pulled out. 15.18.13.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.18.13.1.1.  If DATA-NAME contained "NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL.." DATA-NAME[8,15] evaluates to "THE TIME". 15.18.14.  Syntax Rules. 15.18.14.1.  Literals cannot be partialed. 15.18.14.2.  UDDN. 15.18.14.2.1.  Numeric-UDDN items (beginning with "#") cannot be partialed. 15.18.14.2.2.  Alphanumeric-UDDN  items  can  be  partialed  even  if  they  contain numbers. 15.18.14.3.  SDDN can be partialed. 15.18.14.4.  DBDN can be partialed.  PIC 9 COMP fields are numbers in binary form and can,  for  instance,  represent  a  10-digit  decimal  number  in  only  four  character  positions.  Therefore, PIC 9 COMP fields are converted to DISPLAY (expanded) form before being AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1581 partialed.  Unpredictable results may occur if an attempt is made to partial a schema defined group item containing PIC 9 COMP fields. 15.18.14.5.  Indexed data names may not be partialed.  An indexed item may be moved to a nonindexed item and then partialed, or a partial may be moved to an indexed item. 15.19.  Condition Names. 15.19.1.  Purpose.  To define Condition Names. 15.19.2.  Condition Names.  When a decision has to be made, a test could be performed such as does A = B.  The answer would be TRUE or FALSE.  When a condition name is referenced, SURGE  makes  the  test  and  then  makes  available  the  TRUE  or  FALSE.    FALSE  is  always represented by 0, TRUE is represented by every other value, positive or negative.  Therefore, the value one (1) also represents TRUE. 15.19.2.1.  DEFAULT is always TRUE, value one (1).  This condition name may be used as the test of the last "OR" in a choice construct.  If all other tests fail, DEFAULT will force this selection to process. 15.19.2.1.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.19.2.1.1.1.  DECIDE:  CHOOSE SD = ‘A1’ 15.19.2.1.1.2.  DO PROCESS1; 15.19.2.1.1.3.  DECIDE:  OR SD = ‘A2’ 15.19.2.1.1.4.  DO PROCESS2; 15.19.2.1.1.5.  DECIDE:  OR DEFAULT 15.19.2.1.1.6.  DO PROCESS-OTHERS; 15.19.2.1.1.7.  DECIDE:  END 15.19.2.2.  END-OF-FILE.  The test "$STATUS  = ‘9’" is performed, and if true, END-OF-FILE is given a value of one (1) (TRUE) or else it is given a value of zero (0) (FALSE). 15.19.2.3.  NO-FIND.  The test "$STATUS = '8'" is performed and if true, NO-FIND is given a value of one (1) (TRUE) or else it is given a value of zero (0) (FALSE). 15.19.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.19.3.1.  Can be used in any expression. 15.19.3.2.  Cannot be partialed or indexed. Section 15L—-Separators 15.20.  Separators. 15.20.1.  Purpose.  To define separators. 15.20.2.  Separators.  In most cases, words are separated by spaces in the SURGE language.  Words are recognized as words by both the programmers and the SURGE compiler because of the spaces.  In expressions, several more separators are required.  The complete list is: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1582 15.20.2.1.  ^            space 15.20.2.2.  ,            comma 15.20.2.3.  (            left parenthesis 15.20.2.4.  )            right parenthesis 15.20.2.5.  [            left bracket 15.20.2.6.  ]            right bracket 15.20.2.7.  ;            semicolon 15.20.3.  General Rules.  The space (^) separator carries no special meaning except to separate words or symbols; therefore, it may be repeated as desired.  All the other separators carry a special meaning and may not be used or repeated out of context. Section 15M—-Space 15.20.4.  Purpose.  To define SPACES. 15.20.5.  Space.  "^".  Separates words. 15.20.5.1.  EXAMPLE: Figure 15.23.  Space Example No 1. 15.20.5.1.1.  Also separates other separators or separates separators from words.  15.20.5.2.  EXAMPLE: Figure 15.24.  Space Example No 2. Section 15N—-Comma 15.20.6.  Purpose.  To explain the use of the COMMA in SURGE.  AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1583 15.20.7.  Comma  (“,”).    The  comma  separates  operands  in  functions,  partials,  or  indexed database items. 15.20.7.1.  EXAMPLES: 15.20.7.1.1.  DAYS-DIFFERENCE (A,84056) 15.20.7.1.2.  A[2,16] 15.20.7.1.3.  001-COMP-ENTR(2,3) 15.20.8.  Syntax Rules. 15.20.8.1.  May be preceded or followed by spaces. 15.20.8.2.  May be used freely within an alphanumeric literal  where it does not  act  as a separator. Section 15O—-Left and Right Parentheses 15.20.9.  Purpose.  To define the purpose of the parentheses. 15.20.10.  Left and Right Parentheses "( )".  Parentheses do three things: 15.20.10.1.  They enclose, and thereby, define the operands in a function: 15.20.10.1.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.20.10.1.1.1.  ROOT(A) 15.20.10.1.1.1.1.  DAYS-DIFFERENCE(A, B) 15.20.10.2.  They enclose, and thereby, define the index in an indexed data name. 15.20.10.2.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.20.10.2.1.1.  SRAN(C) 15.20.10.2.1.2.  TABLE-ENTRY(25) 15.20.10.3.  They control the order of processing in an expression.  All items in parentheses are resolved first, followed by any items outside the parentheses.  All items within multiple parentheses are resolved from the innermost parentheses first to the outermost parentheses and then to any items outside the parentheses. 15.20.10.3.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.20.10.3.1.1.  (A + B) * (C + D) will not resolve the same as A + B * C + D. 15.20.11.  Syntax Rules. 15.20.11.1.  Parentheses may be preceded or followed by spaces. 15.20.11.2.  Parentheses may be freely used within an alphanumeric literal but do not affect the order of evaluation of an expression containing such a literal. 15.20.11.3.  For every opening parenthesis, "(", there must be a closing parentheses, ")". AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1584 Section 15P—-Left and Right Brackets 15.20.12.  Purpose.  To define brackets. 15.20.13.  Left and Right Brackets "[ ]".  Brackets enclose and thereby, define the operands in partials. 15.20.13.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.20.13.1.1.  A[1,3] 15.20.13.1.2.  B[FROM,TO] 15.20.14.  Syntax Rules. 15.20.14.1.  May be preceded or followed by spaces. 15.20.14.2.  May be used freely within an alphanumeric literal where they do not  act  as separators. Section 15Q—-Operators 15.21.  Operators. 15.21.1.  Purpose.  To define Operators as used in SURGE. 15.21.2.  Operators.  All expressions are comprised of operands and operators.  Operands are those  data  items  operated  upon.    In  the  expression  "A  +  B",  "A"  and  "B"  are  operands.  Operators tell what is to be done to the operands.  In the expression "A + B", "+" is the operator.  Operators range from the familiar arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide) to the less familiar logical and concatenation operators. 15.21.3.  Arithmetic  Operators.    Arithmetic  operators  work  on  numeric  value  items  and  on numbers in alphanumeric string form.  Internal conversion occurs automatically.  If conversion is not possible, an error will occur. 15.21.3.1.  Addition (+).  Adds two operands together, and places the result on an internal stack. 15.21.3.1.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.3.1.1.1.  A + 5 15.21.3.2.  Subtraction (-).  Subtracts  second operand from  first  operand,  and places the result on an internal stack. 15.21.3.2.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.3.2.1.1.  B - C 15.21.3.3.  Multiplication (*).  Multiplies two operands together, and places the result on an internal stack. 15.21.3.3.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.3.3.1.1.  B * 2 AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1585 15.21.3.4.  Division (/).  Divides first operand by second operand, and places the result on an internal stack. 15.21.3.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.3.4.1.1.  B / 2 15.21.4.  Relational  Operators.    Compares  two  operands  and  returns  one  (1)  (TRUE)  if  the specified condition  exists or zero (0) (FALSE) if the specified condition  is  not  found.  The result (0 or 1) is placed on an internal stack and the internal true/false flag is set.  Both operands must be the same class; that is, numeric or alphanumeric string. 15.21.4.1.  EQUAL, = 15.21.4.1.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.4.1.1.1.  A = B 15.21.4.2.  NOT EQUAL, <> 15.21.4.2.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.4.2.1.1.  A <> B 15.21.4.3.  LESS THAN, < 15.21.4.3.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.4.3.1.1.  A <  B 15.21.4.4.  GREATER THAN, > 15.21.4.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.4.4.1.1.  A > B 15.21.4.5.  LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO, <= 15.21.4.5.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.4.5.1.1.  A <= B 15.21.4.6.  EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN, => 15.21.4.6.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.4.6.1.1.  A => B 15.21.5.  Logical Operators.  Logical operators work on numeric value items and numbers in alphanumeric  string  form.    Internal  conversion  occurs  automatically.    If  conversion  is  not possible, an error will occur. 15.21.5.1.  NOT.    The  NOT  operator  inverts  the  value  of  the  following  operand  from TRUE to FALSE or vice versa.  If an operand has a value of zero (FALSE) the result will become one (TRUE).  If an operand has a value other than zero, such as 1, -2, +8, 15, etc., (TRUE), the result will become zero (FALSE).  The result (1 or 0) is placed on an internal stack and the internal TRUE/FALSE FLAG is set. 15.21.5.1.1.  EXAMPLE: AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1586 15.21.5.1.1.1.  NOT A 15.21.5.1.1.2.  NOT A = B 15.21.5.2.  AND.  Compares two operands to determine if both are TRUE (not zero). 15.21.5.2.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.5.2.1.1.  A AND B 15.21.5.2.1.2.  A > B AND A > C 15.21.5.3.  OR.  Compares two operands to determine if one of them is TRUE (not zero). 15.21.5.3.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.5.3.1.1.  A OR B 15.21.5.3.1.2.  D < E OR F = 2 15.21.6.  Concatenation (&).  It is sometimes desirable to build a longer string out of two or more  shorter  strings.    One  use  is  to  construct  print  lines.    The  concatenation  symbol  (&) operates  on  two  operands.    The  operands  must  contain  alphanumeric  strings,  representing either alphabetic or numeric data.  An attempt to concatenate a numeric value item into a string will  result  in  the  numeric  value  item  being  automatically  converted  into  a  string  before concatenation.  The resultant string is placed on an internal stack. 15.21.6.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.6.1.1.  A & B 15.21.6.1.2.  PAGE NO., & PG-CNT 15.21.7.  Unary  Minus  (-).    The  unary  minus  inverts  the  sign  of  numeric-value  items  or numbers in alphanumeric string form, from plus (+) to minus (-) and vice versa.  It works on the  operand  following  it.    Remember,  the  minus  is  not  a  separator  and  therefore  must  be preceded and followed by a space or other separator.  The result is placed on an internal stack. 15.21.7.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.7.1.1.  - B 15.21.7.1.2.  - (2 + B) 15.21.7.1.3.  B * ( - A) 15.21.7.1.4.  B * ( - (A) ) 15.21.8.  Function  Operators.    Functions  are  both  operators  and  function  operators  (see functions). 15.21.9.  General Note For Operand of Operators.  In the examples above, each expression was represented in its most simple form.  In the expression “A + B = C * D” there are 3 operators (+, =, *).  Each of these 3 operators can work on two and only two operands each.  The plus (+) works on “A” and “B” giving an intermediate result.  The multiplication (*) works on “C” and “D” giving a second intermediate result.  No operator in this example works on more than two operands.  This principle must be kept in mind when studying the above examples.  The intermediate results are stored on an internal stack until needed. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1587 Section 15R—-Operators Precedence 15.21.10.  Purpose.  To define Operator Precedence. 15.21.11.  Operator Precedence.  Expressions are comprised of operands and operators which work upon the operands. 15.21.11.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.21.11.1.1.  A + B * C - 2 15.21.11.1.2.  This  example  has  three  operators.    The  order  in  which  the  operations occur is determined by two things:  (1) parentheses, and (2) operator precedence. 15.21.12.  Overriding Operator Precedence.  The order in which SURGE evaluates expressions can be changed by using parentheses.  Operations within parentheses are performed first.  If more  than  one  set  of  parentheses  is  present,  SURGE  evaluates  them  from  left  to  right.  Parentheses can be nested within parentheses.  SURGE will evaluate the innermost set first, then the next innermost, proceeding to the outermost set.  Parentheses may be nested to any level  and  used  freely  to  clarify  the  order  of  operations  within  an  expression.    The  SURGE compiler can detect and will indicate when an expression becomes too large or complex.  This would be caused by the physical limitations of the computer, not the evaluation technique and should be a rare occurrence. 15.21.13.  Precedence.  All operators have a precedence which determines the order in which they are processed.  For example; multiplication (*) has a higher precedence than plus.  In the expression "2 + 3 * 4", the "3 * 4" will evaluate to 12 and then the 2 will be added to 12 giving 14.  This illustrates the rule that operators with the higher precedence will evaluate first.  Plus (+) and minus (-) have the same precedence and process in sequence.  In the example "2 + 3 - 4",  the  "2  +  3"  is  evaluated  first  giving  5,  and  then  4  is  subtracted  from  5  giving  1.    This illustrates the rule that operators of the same precedence are evaluated from left to right.  The details of each operator are best expressed in table form.  Please refer to Table of Precedence. Section 15S—-Legend for Table of Precedence 15.21.14.  Purpose.  To define items in Table of Precedence (Table 15.7). 15.21.15.  Column  1  -  Type  of  Operator.    This  column  displays  the  name  of  the  type  of operator. 15.21.15.1.  AN-Function. description.   Alphanumeric  function.   See  functions  for  complete 15.21.15.2.  N-Function.  Numeric function.  See functions for complete description. 15.21.15.3.  Unary Minus.  Inverts numeric sign of numeric-value item. 15.21.15.4.  Concatenation.  Combines two shorter strings into a single longer string.  See operators for complete description. 15.21.15.5.  Arithmetic.    Effects  simple  mathematics.    See  operators  for  complete description. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1588 15.21.15.6.  Relational.  Evaluates relationships between variables such as less than, equal to, and greater than.  See operators for complete description. 15.21.15.7.  Logical.  These are also referred to as Boolean operators.  See operators for complete details. 15.21.16.  Column 2 - Precedence.  This column contains the actual precedence number which is  used  to  determine  the  order  of  processing  not  otherwise  modified  by  parentheses.  Precedence  9  is  reserved  for  expansion.    Operators  with  a  higher  precedence  are  processed first. 15.21.17.  Column 3 - Operator/Function.  This column contains the actual symbol or name that SURGE will recognize as the operator.  Some items are both operators and functions; these are referred to as functions. 15.21.18.  Columns 4 and 5 - Class, Input/Output.  These two columns specify the class of data that each operator can operate upon, and the class of data that the operation will output. 15.21.18.1.  ANS.  Alphanumeric string.  This class is a string of characters, including a string which looks like a number. 15.21.18.2.  NV.  Numeric value.  This class is a number that can be used efficiently in a mathematical process. 15.21.19.  Column 6 - # of Operands.  This column specifies the number of operands which each operator acts upon.  If the number of operands is one (1), the operator is said to be either a unary operator or a unary function.  If the number of operands is two (2), the operator is said to be either a binary operator or a binary function. Section 15T—-Table of Precedence 15.21.20.  Purpose.  To present Table of Precedence.

ANS.  NV will be automatically converted to ANS before the operation is performed. 2.  ANS or NV.  Both input operands must be the same class or an error will occur. 3.  NV.  ANS will be automatically converted to NV, if possible, before operation is performed.  If conversion is impossible, an error will occur. 4.  ANS.  This is really numeric data in pure binary form.  Some values appear to be alphanumeric data while others appear to be special characters or even unprintable garbage.  This data can be moved around as if it were an alphanumeric string. 15.22.  The Expression Construction. 15.22.1.  Purpose.  To define the EXPRESSION. 15.22.1.1.  Function.    Expressions  cause  data  items  to  work  upon  data  items  under  the control of operators.  Therefore, expressions are just that.  They are expressions of what is to happen with the data items specified in the expression. 15.22.1.1.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.22.1.1.1.1.  A * (B + C) 15.22.1.1.1.2.  This  says,  add  B  and  C  and  then  multiply  the  result  by  A.    This expression does not say what to do with the result, just to calculate it.  What is done with the result is determined by the SURGE construct or SURGE verb phrase in AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1590 which  it  appears.    The  expression  construction  is  best  described  in  three  forms, simple,  intermediate,  and  compound.    Each  of  these  three  forms  has  its  own skeleton. 15.22.1.2.  Skeleton. 15.22.1.2.1.  Simple Expression.  (sim-exp) Figure 15.25.  Simple Expression Skeleton. 15.22.1.2.2.  Intermediate Level Expression.  (int-exp).  Figure 15.26.

None; the syntax is fully defined in the skeleton.  AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1591 15.22.1.4.  General Rules. 15.22.1.4.1.  The class of the data output from an expression is determined by the last operation performed.  The two classes are alphanumeric string (ANS) or numeric value (NV). 15.22.1.4.1.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.22.1.4.1.1.1.  (NAME IS & NAMEFIELD) = B 15.22.1.4.1.1.2.  The literal NAME IS would be concatenated with the name in NAMEFIELD  producing  an  ANS.    That  ANS  would  be  compared  with  the contents of B producing a numeric value one (TRUE) or zero (FALSE).  The class of data output from this expression would be numeric value. 15.22.1.4.2.  Some expressions can get too complicated because of the limited number of internal registers.  If SURGE does not give the warning "expression too complex", it will evaluate correctly. 15.22.1.4.3.  All  operators  may  be  combined  in  one  expression.    There  are  no combinations of operators in an expression that are invalid. 15.22.1.4.3.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.22.1.4.3.1.1.  #A = #B = #C is valid but tricky 15.22.1.4.3.1.2.  (A OR B) + 2 is valid 15.22.1.4.3.1.3.  ROOT(C * D(2)/(1 + B)) is valid 15.22.1.4.4.  Since  automatic  conversion  between  ANS  and  NV,  or  NV  and  ANS occurs  for  intermediate  values  in  some  expressions,  care  must  be  exercised  when writing them because although any NV can be converted to an ANS, not every ANS can be converted to an NV. 15.22.1.4.5.  Notice  that  simple  expressions  can  be  part  of  intermediate-level expressions  and  that  simple,  intermediate  level,  and  complex  expressions  can  be included in complex expressions.  This allows for expressions as complex or as simple as the programmer wishes to use. Section 15U—-Program Constructs 15.23.  Program Constructs. 15.23.1.  Purpose.  To define program constructs in general. 15.23.2.  Program Constructs.  The program construct is a syntactically correct and complete string  of  words  beginning  with  a  program  construct  name,  a  word  identifying  the  type  of program construct (SEQUENCE, CHOOSE, OR, REPEAT, ASSUME) and ending with the same program construct name and the key word END.  A program construct tells the SURGE program when to do something.  Program constructs and verb phrases can be nested within program constructs.  There are four types of program constructs:  sequential, choice, repetition, and assumption/admission. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1592 Section 15V—-Sequential Construct 15.23.3.  Purpose.  To define the Sequential Construct. 15.23.3.1.  Function.  This  construct  is  used to  execute unconditionally, a series of verb phrases and program constructs in the order they appear. 15.23.3.2.

Both construct-names must be the same. 15.23.3.3.2.  There are no spaces between the construct-names and the colons.  There is at least one space following the colons. 15.23.3.3.3.  The construct-body is made up of one or more syntactically correct and complete verb phrases and program constructs. 15.23.3.3.3.1.  EXAMPLE 1: 15.23.3.3.3.1.1.  SAMPLE-PGM:  SEQUENCE 15.23.3.3.3.1.2.  FORMAT OFF; 15.23.3.3.3.1.3.  MOVE ‘SAMPLE PROGRAM’ TO PL; 15.23.3.3.3.1.4.  PRINT PL; 15.23.3.3.3.1.5.  SAMPLE-PGM:  END 15.23.3.3.3.2.

MOVE ‘ANOTHER SAMPLE PROGRAM’ TO OUT-LINE; 15.23.3.3.3.2.6.  PRINT OUT-LINE; 15.23.3.3.3.2.7.  ANOTHER-PGM:  END Section 15W—-Choice Construct 15.23.4.  Purpose.  To define the Choice Construct. 15.23.4.1.  Function.  This construct is used to execute none or one of many of a possible series of verb phrases and program constructs. 15.23.4.2.  Skeleton. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1593 Figure 15.28.  CHOOSE Skeleton. 15.23.4.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.23.4.3.1.  All construct-names must be the same.  15.23.4.3.2.  There are no spaces between the construct-names and the colons.  There is at least one space following the colons. 15.23.4.3.3.  The construct-bodies are made up of zero or more syntactically  correct and complete verb phrases and program constructs. 15.23.4.3.4.  The  syntax  rules  for  expressions  are  defined  in  the  paragraph  on expressions. 15.23.4.4.  General Rules. 15.23.4.4.1.  The expressions can be thought of as conditions which can be true or false.  For example, the expression A = B is considered true if A equals B, false if A does not equal B.  During execution, the expressions will be scanned until one is found that is true.  The construct-body that immediately follows that expression will be executed.  All other construct-bodies are skipped. 15.23.4.4.2.  If none of the expressions are found to be true, nothing will be executed. 15.23.4.4.3.  If DEFAULT is coded in place of the second or subsequent expressions, that condition is always assumed to be true.  For this reason, if DEFAULT is used in place of an expression other than the last condition, all subsequent conditions become meaningless, and their associated construct bodies will never be executed. 15.23.4.4.3.1.

Both construct-names are the same.  15.23.5.3.2.  There  are  no  spaces  between  the  construct-names  and  the  colons  (:).  There is at least one space following the colons. 15.23.5.3.3.  The construct-body is one or more syntactically correct and complete verb phrases and program constructs. 15.23.5.4.  General Rules. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1595 15.23.5.4.1.  The  construct-body  will  be  executed  repetitively  until  one  of  the following conditions is met: 15.23.5.4.2.  The condition specified in the UNTIL clause is true, or 15.23.5.4.3.  The condition specified in the WHILE clause is false, or 15.23.5.4.4.  The construct body has been executed the number of times specified in the TIMES clause. 15.23.5.5.  The above conditions are checked before the first execution of the construct-body.  It is, therefore, possible not to execute the construct-body at all. 15.23.5.6.  The integer-expression must be an expression that resolves to a non-negative integer value; otherwise an error will result. 15.23.5.7.  The integer-expression is evaluated once before the first (if any) execution of the  construct-body.    This  integer  value  will  determine  the  number  of  executions  of  the construct-body regardless of changes to the values of any data names used in the integer-expression. 15.23.5.8.  If  no  UNTIL,  WHILE,  or  TIMES  clause  is  specified,  the  construct-body execution will be repeated indefinitely until a STOP verb terminates the program or a QUIT verb (for an assumption construct in which the repetition is nested) is executed. 15.23.6.

This construct is used to execute one of two possible series of verb phrases and program constructs.  This construct differs from the choice construct in three ways: 15.23.7.1.1.  There are only two choices. 15.23.7.1.2.  There is no condition to be checked as part of the construct to determine which of the two series of verb phrases and program constructs is to be executed. 15.23.7.1.3.  The first series of verb phrases and program constructs (the "ASSUME" leg) is always executed until the program determines it should have executed the second series of verb phrases and program constructs (the "ADMIT" leg).  The Admit leg is then executed.  This construct is particularly useful when editing for valid data.  That is, the data is “assumed” to be valid until the program is forced to “admit” that the data is invalid. 15.23.7.2.

To define the scope of the Verb Phrases. 15.24.2.  Verb Phrases.  The description of the verb phrases are broken down into six groups: database  access,  disk/tape  input/output,  other  input/output,  data  manipulation,  program execution control, and miscellaneous. Section 15AA—-Database Access Verbs 15.24.3.  Purpose.  To define the verbs that access the database. 15.24.4.  DB-READ Verb. 15.24.4.1.  Function.  The DB-READ verb reads a record from the database and makes it available to the program. 15.24.4.2.  Skeleton.  General form. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1599 Figure 15.30.  DB-READ Skeleton.  15.24.4.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.24.4.3.1.  Database record-name and set-name must be the names of a record and a set within the SURGE processor's view of the database. 15.24.4.3.2.  The  word  SEQUENTIALLY  is  not  required.    If  neither  VIA,  USING, DIRECT, nor SEQUENTIALLY is specified, SEQUENTIALLY is assumed. 15.24.4.3.3.  The USING clause can only be used if the specified record type can be accessed using a CALC key. 15.24.4.3.4.  Key-expression is either an alphanumeric literal or an ANUDDN. 15.24.4.3.5.  UDDN must be alphanumeric. 15.24.4.4.  General Rules. 15.24.4.4.1.  After a database read, the record read is said to be the current record being processed of its record type and of all sets in which it participates.  Sometimes it can be referred to simply as the current record.  When reading a record type sequentially or when reading a set, it is extremely important for the programmer to keep track of which record is current.  Reading a record sequentially can affect currency in a set and reading a record via set can affect the current record for future sequential reads.  If currency needs to  remain the same in  a set  or for a record type after the read, the SAVE and RESTORE verbs can be used to reestablish the currency that existed before the read.  For example, if an Item-Detail set is being scanned and after one of the Detail Records is read, the program needs to read another related Item Record, the pointer to the current record within the Item-Detail set will be destroyed unless it is SAVED before the Item Record read and RESTORED afterwards.  (See SAVE and RESTORE verbs.) 15.24.4.4.2.  After a read, the database record code will be available in SURGE-defined data item $RECORD-CODE.  If the record was a Detail Record the type detail code will  be  in  $TYPE-DETAIL;  otherwise  it  will  be  blank.    These  features  allow  the program to determine which type of record was read when using the NEXT RECORD or NEXT DETAIL clauses. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1600 15.24.4.4.3.  Detail Records are read into the same memory space regardless of the type detail.  Therefore, reading a Detail Record will overlay the previous record read.  All other record types have their own memory space and reading any other record will only overlay records of the same type. 15.24.4.4.4.  Using  the  NEXT  RECORD  VIA  set-name  option  will  cause  the  next record in the set (regardless of record type) to be read.  The next record is the record to which the record currently being processed in the set points.  If there is no next record in the set or if the current record points to the owner (e.g., a Detail Record points to an Item Record as the next record in the set) then an END-OF-FILE condition results and the current record remains the same. 15.24.4.4.5.  Using the OWNER VIA set-name option will cause the owner record of the specified set to be read.  For example, if the owner record is read via an Item-Detail set, then the Item Record which points to that current Detail Record is the one read. 15.24.4.4.6.  Using  the  record-name  VIA  set-name  option  will  cause  the  set  to  be canned from the current record towards the end of the set looking for the first record encountered of the name specified.  If one is found it is read.  If one is not found before reaching the end of the set, or the owner record, an END-OF-FILE condition results and the current record remains the same. 15.24.4.4.7.  When trying to find more than one detail record type in the same scan, use DB-READ NEXT RECORD VIA set-name and check $RECORD-CODE to determine which record you have just read.  This type of read will find all record types in a given area. 15.24.4.4.8.  The USING clause reads the record of the type specified which contains, in its key field, a value equal to the key-expression.  If no such record exists, a NO-FIND condition results. 15.24.4.4.9.  Using the  DIRECT clause requires that $PAGE-NUM and $RECORD-NUM be set to the 5-digit page number and record number of the record to be read.  If these fields are not numeric an error results and the program is terminated.  If they do not represent a valid page and record number of the specified record type, a NO-FIND condition occurs.  If neither of the above conditions occur, then the DIRECT option will read the record of the specified record type that is at the location given in $PAGE-NUM and $RECORD-NUM. 15.24.4.4.10.  The SEQUENTIALLY clause causes the next record within the database of the specified type to be read.  If the NEXT DETAIL clause is also specified, then any Detail Record is considered to be of the specified type. 15.24.4.4.11.  The result  of the latest  DB-READ  executed is  left  in  SURGE-defined data item $STATUS.  If the STATUS clause is used the result will also be left in the UDDN.  Possible values for this status and the meanings are: 15.24.4.4.11.1.  0 - Successful completion 15.24.4.4.11.2.  8 - Record not found (NO-FIND) 15.24.4.4.11.3.  9 - End of file/set (END-OF-FILE) AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1601 15.24.4.4.11.4.  For examples, refer to ACCESS/SURGE(0) handout. 15.24.4.4.11.5.  When reading records where overflow of CALC chain occurs (that is, transaction history) use the following example: 15.24.4.4.11.6.  A: SEQUENCE 15.24.4.4.11.7.  DB-READ 010**01450417; 901/TRANSACTION-HISTORY USING 15.24.4.4.11.8.  B: REPEAT UNTIL $STATUS <> ‘0’ 15.24.4.4.11.9.  PRINT 901-CALC-KEY ; 15.24.4.4.11.10.

The Restore verb reestablishes a record as the current record being processed within the specified set (for reading VIA SET) or of the specified record type (for reading sequentially).  The record is reread using the database location (database key) previously saved. 15.24.5.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.31.  RESTORE Skeleton. 15.24.5.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.24.5.3.1.  Set-name and record-name are both DBDN and must specify either a set in which the record to be reread participates, or the correct record-name of that record.  15.24.5.3.2.  UDDN must be an ANUDDN. 15.24.5.4.  General Rules. 15.24.5.4.1.  After  execution  of  the  RESTORE  verb  the  record  specified  by  the database location (database key) in UDDN will be reread. 15.24.5.4.2.  If the SET clause is specified, the record will be established as the current record being processed within that record set (set currency). 15.24.5.4.3.  If the RECORD clause is specified, the record will be established as the current record being processed of that record type only (record currency). AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1602 15.24.5.4.4.  If neither the SET nor RECORD clause are specified, the record will be established as the current record of its own record type and the current record being processed within all sets in which it participates (both record and set currency). 15.24.5.4.5.  If either the SET or RECORD clause is specified and the record read does not participate in the specified set or is not of the specified record type then an error will occur and the program will terminate.  UDDN must contain the location (database key) of a record in the database obtained from a previous SAVE command. 15.24.5.4.5.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.5.4.5.1.1.  See example in SAVE VERB, below. 15.24.6.  SAVE Verb. 15.24.6.1.  Function.  The SAVE verb saves the location within the database (the database key) of the record currently being processed within the specified set (when reading via set) or of the specified record type (when reading sequentially).  This location may later be used to restore the record as the one currently being processed. 15.24.6.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.32.  SAVE Skeleton. 15.24.6.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.24.6.3.1.  Set-name and record-name are both DBDN. 15.24.6.3.2.  UDDN must be an ANUDDN. 15.24.6.4.  General Rules.  15.24.6.4.1.  After execution of the SAVE verb the UDDN will contain the 4- character database  key  (location  within  the  database)  of  the  most  currently  processed  record within the set or of the record type specified. 15.24.6.4.2.  This  key  will  most  likely  contain  unprintable  characters  and  therefore, should not be printed or displayed.  The key can be moved to another data name, written to  disk  to  be  read  later,  and  used  to  restore  a  record  as  the  current  record  being processed. 15.24.6.4.3.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.6.4.3.1.

The  START  verb  when  used  with  the  data-base-record-name  option causes the next DB-READ SEQUENTIALLY (of the specified record type) to read the first record of that type in the database. 15.24.7.4.2.  The START verb, when used with the DETAIL option, causes the next DB-READ  NEXT  DETAIL  SEQUENTIALLY  to  read  the  first  detail  record  in  the database. 15.24.7.4.3.  If the last record is  read (end of  file) that record name is  automatically STARTed again. 15.24.7.4.4.  The  DETAIL  record  and  all  other  record  types  will  automatically  be STARTed at the beginning of the program. 15.24.7.4.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.7.4.4.1.1.

General Rules. 15.24.9.4.1.  If filename is disk file: after the file is closed, it is no longer available for reads and writes unless it is RE-OPENED. 15.24.9.4.1.1.  If  the  DELETE  option  is  specified,  the  file  is  dropped  from  the system and is no longer available to any user.  Files that are already opened must be closed before closing and/or deleting any other files. 15.24.9.4.1.2.  The delete option may only be used with files opened for input. 15.24.9.4.2.  If the file is a tape file: after the file is closed it is no longer available to the program and may not be opened again; the tape is rewound and the tape drive is made available to other runs; a tape file may not be deleted. 15.24.9.4.2.1.  All open files are closed automatically when the program ends. 15.24.9.4.2.2.  All files opened for work (that is, the OPEN verb phrase contained a  WORK  clause)  and  not  closed  are  closed  and  deleted  automatically  when  the program ends (if they have not already been deleted). 15.24.9.4.2.2.1.

Filename-2 is the external filename under which the file is (or will be)  cataloged  in  the  system.    It  must  have  a  qualifier  if  the  SAME  clause  is  not specified, and it must not have a qualifier if the SAME clause is specified. 15.24.10.3.1.3.  The WORK clause can be used only with OPEN OUTPUT.  (The file may later be closed and reopened for input.) 15.24.10.3.1.4.  Integer-1 must be equal to or greater than 1 and less than or equal to the maximum record size listed in Para. 15.15. for filename-1. 15.24.10.3.1.5.  Integer-2 if used, must be equal to 1. 15.24.10.3.2.  Format 2. 15.24.10.3.2.1.  Filename-3 must be an internal disk filename (see Para 15.16.). 15.24.10.3.2.2.  There must be an OPEN and CLOSE for filename-3 elsewhere in the program. 15.24.10.3.3.  Format 3. 15.24.10.3.3.1.  Filename-4 must be one of the internal filenames for SURGE tape files which is listed in Para 15.16. 15.24.10.3.3.2.  The data names must be ANUDDN. 15.24.10.3.3.3.

Filename-5  must  be  one  of  the  internal  filenames  for  SBSS  tape files listed in Para 15.16. 15.24.10.3.4.2.  Filename-6  must  be  a  qualified  external  filename  of  an  already cataloged file. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1607 15.24.10.3.4.3.  The rules for the data names and literals from format 3 apply. 15.24.10.3.4.4.  Up to twelve (12) reels may be specified. 15.24.10.3.5.  Filename-2 and filename-6 are alphanumeric literals enclosed in single quotes. 15.24.10.4.  General Rules. 15.24.10.4.1.  The USING clause in formats 1 and 4 and the SAME clause in format 1 are used to determine the external filename (the name under which the file is cataloged in the Master File Directory) of the file being opened.  The rules used to determine the filename are as follows: 15.24.10.4.1.1.  If  the  USING  clause  is  specified  (in  formats  1  and  4)  and  the SAME  clause  is  not,  then  the  external  filename  will  be  taken  entirely  from  the USING clause.  The filename or the contents of the data name in the USING clause must be a fully qualified filename. 15.24.10.4.1.2.  If  both  the  USING  clause  and  the  SAME  clause  are  specified (format 1 only) then the qualifier will be gBPSxxx (where g is the gang number and xxx is the restart number assigned by NGV801).  The rest of the filename will be taken from the USING clause.  The filename or the contents of the data name in the USING clause must be an unqualified filename. 15.24.10.4.1.3.  If  the  SAME  clause  is  specified  and  the  USING  clause  is  not (format  1  only),  then  the  qualifier  will  be  gBPS  xxx  (see  rule  above)  and  the filename will be the one associated with the internal filename in Para 15.16. 15.24.10.4.1.4.  If neither the SAME nor the USING clause is specified (that is, the WORK clause is specified in format 1), then the external filename is built entirely by the SURGE processor.  Since work files only exist during the execution of the local SURGE program (it is deleted when the programs ends),the programmer does not need to be concerned with what the external filename is. 15.24.10.4.2.  Files that are opened for input must be already cataloged in the system Master  File  Directory  under  the  external  filename  derived  as  shown  in  the  above paragraph.  SURGE will attempt to assign the file.  If the attempt is successful, the file is opened and processing continues.  If the file cannot be assigned, an error results and the program is terminated. 15.24.10.4.3.  Files that are opened for output (but not for work) need not, but may be already cataloged.  If the file is not catalogued, SURGE will catalog and assign it.  If the cataloging and assigning are successful, the file is opened and processing continues.  Otherwise, an error results and the program is terminated. 15.24.10.4.4.  Files OPENED for WORK must not be cataloged.  If they are, an error results and the program is terminated.  Otherwise, the procedures for opening are the same as in the paragraph above. 15.24.10.4.5.  Reel numbers must be specified in the order they are to be used.  Blank reel numbers are interpreted as no reel and are ignored. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1608 15.24.10.4.6.  Record and block lengths given on a file opened for input must match the existing record and block lengths of that file.  If not, an error results and the program is terminated. 15.24.10.4.7.  A file may not be reopened unless it has been previously opened and is currently closed at the time of the execution of the reopen. 15.24.10.5.  Skeleton.  Specific formats. 15.24.10.5.1.

Literal is an alphanumeric literal, in quotes, 48 characters long or shorter. 15.24.16.4.  General Rules. 15.24.16.4.1.  The following actions are taken when the FORMAT verb is executed: 15.24.16.4.1.1.  Any open report is closed and directed to the printer specified in $REPORT-PRINTER. 15.24.16.4.1.2.  $REPORT-SD  is  examined.    If  it  contains  a  valid  system designator and the base constants contains a printer device name for that system designator, then $REPORT-PRINTER is set to that device name.  If $REPORT-SD is  blank  or  contains  an  invalid  system  designator,  then  $REPORT-PRINTER  is examined.  If $REPORT-PRINTER is blank or if it does not contain a valid printer device name, then $REPORT-PRINTER will be set to the device name of the 01 account  printer  (host  RPS  printer;  i.e.;  014-SITE-ID  of  the  (014)  BASE-CONSTANTS-2 record). 15.24.16.4.1.3.  The following SDDN will be set as follows: 15.24.16.4.1.3.1.  $LINES-PER-PAGE will be set to the value of integer-1. 15.24.16.4.1.3.2.  $LINES-PRINTED will be set to zero. 15.24.16.4.1.3.3.  $TOP-LINES  and  $BOTTOM-LINES  will  be  set  to  the values of integer-2 and integer-3, respectively. 15.24.16.4.1.3.4.  $LINE-SPACING will be set to 1 for SINGLE spacing, 2 for DOUBLE spacing or 3 for TRIPLE.  (Note:  Can be set to a value from 1-9 by the programmer.) 15.24.16.4.1.3.5.  $NBR-HEADERS  will  be  set  to  1,  2,  or  3  based  on  the HEADER/HEADERS clause or 0 if the HEADER/HEADERS clause was not specified. 15.24.16.4.1.3.6.  $TRAILER-FLAG  will  be  set  to  1  if  the  TRAILER  clause was specified; if not, $TRAILER-FLAG will be set to 0. 15.24.16.4.2.  If  the  HEADER/HEADERS  clause  was  specified  and  $REPORT-SD contained  a  valid  system  designator,  information  will  be  placed  in  the  first  header ($HEADER-1)as follows: 15.24.16.4.2.1.  Columns  1-9  will  be  set  to  the  SBSS  calendar  date  ($SBSS-DATE). 15.24.16.4.2.2.  Columns  11-26  will  be  set  to  the  base  name  (from  the  base constants) associated with the system designator in $REPORT-SD. 15.24.16.4.2.3.  Columns  102-107  will  be  set  to  the  SRAN  (from  the  base constants) associated with the system designator in $REPORT-SD. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1614 15.24.16.4.2.4.  Columns 109-112 will be set to the constant “DATE”. 15.24.16.4.2.5.  Columns  114-117  will  be  set  to  the  SBSS  Julian  date  ($SBSS-JULIAN). 15.24.16.4.2.6.  If STANDARD (in the PAGE clause) was specified, columns 120-123 will be set to the content “PAGE”. 15.24.16.4.2.7.  The LINES clause specifies the length of the form in lines per page. 15.24.16.4.3.  The TOP and BOTTOM clauses specify the number of blank lines at the top and bottom of the form, respectively. 15.24.16.4.4.  The  HEADER  clause  (in  the  PAGE  clause)  specifies  the  number  of header lines printed at the top of each page.  A blank line is always printed after the first line of the header and (if more than one header line is called for) after the last line.  The contents of the headers must be placed in $HEADER-1 through $HEADER-3 by the programmer except as stated above. 15.24.16.4.5.  The TRAILER clause (in the PAGE clause) specifies that a trailer is to be printed at the bottom of each page. 15.24.16.4.6.  The PAGE clause specifies that the page number is to be placed in the HEADER or TRAILER in the column specified (integer-4) and the next three columns.  The STANDARD option places the page number in the header, (columns 125 through 128). 15.24.16.4.7.  The OFF clause initiates unformatted printing (that is, bin labels, or other header-less reports).  Formatting, in this case, is the programmer's responsibility. 15.24.16.4.8.  If  the  001-PRINT-QUEUE  equals  “1”  and  the  014-SITE-ID  does  not equal  spaces,  the  report  also  goes  to  the  SAFETY  PRINT  QUEUE  (Function  498, System Designator 01). 15.24.17.  PRINT Verb. 15.24.17.1.  Function.  The PRINT verb causes one line of data to be printed.  If formatting is not off, headers, trailers, and page numbering are automatic. 15.24.17.2.  Skeleton.

The total length of printed information must be less than or equal to 132 characters long. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1615 15.24.17.4.  General Rules. 15.24.17.4.1.  If the form  is  at  the top  of a page and formatting is  on, then the page number will be incremented by 1, placed in the header or trailer, and the required blank lines and the headers will be printed.  Note:  The headers will be printed only after a request to print a body (detail) line on the page.  If nobody lines are printed, there will be no headers. 15.24.17.4.2.  The data will be printed. 15.24.17.4.3.  It  is  the  programmer's  responsibility  to  insert  spaces  as  necessary  to separate printed items.  It is suggested that items to be printed are moved to a single data item which is 132 characters long and that the one item is printed. 15.24.17.4.4.  If formatting is on, sufficient blank lines will be printed to accomplish double or triple spacing if called for. 15.24.17.4.5.  If  no  more  room  to  print  detail  lines  is  left  on  the  page  the  trailer  is printed (if required) and the form is positioned at the very top of the next page. 15.24.17.4.6.  When a report is closed and if formatting is on and the form is not at the top  of  the  page,  blank  lines  are  printed  down  to  the  trailer,  the  trailer  is  printed  (if required) and the form is positioned at top of the next page. 15.24.17.4.7.  A report is closed when a new format command is issued or when the program is finished. 15.24.17.4.7.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.17.4.7.1.1.  MOVE 21 TO #AGE; 15.24.17.4.7.1.2.

CONVERT JULIAN requires that SUDDN $JULIAN-CONV be preset to the Julian date being converted.  The format of this Julian date is seven digits, four for  year  and  three  for  day.    The  year's  portion  may  have  spaces  as  the  first  three characters.  In this case the SURGE processor will assume the decade to be the one that makes the year the closest to the current year.  In the case where two possible selections will be 5 years away, the earlier date will be used.  The day portion of the Julian date must be between 001 and 365 (or 366 for leap years).  If $JULIAN-CONV fails these edits, an error will result and the program will terminate.  Upon successful completion of the conversion $CALENDAR-CONV will contain the equivalent calendar date in this format:  four digits for year, one space, three-character alphabetic month (first three positions  of  the  month  name),  one  space,  and  two  digits  for  day  of  month.  $NUMERIC-MONTH will contain a number between 01 and 12 (the numeric code for the  month).    $FISCAL-CONV  will  contain  the  four-digit  fiscal  year  of  the  date converted. 15.24.19.4.1.1.

The DIMENSION verb tells the tokenization process that a UDDN is to be indexed so that it can be used to create tables of like data. 15.24.20.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.20.2.1.  DIMENSION   UDDN (integer) 15.24.20.2.2.  [VALUES ARE literal  [ literal ]  . . . ]; 15.24.20.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.24.20.3.1.  The integer must be a numeric  literal with an integer value between 2 and 255 (for alphanumeric items) or 2 and 128 (for numeric items). 15.24.20.3.2.  The  literals  must  conform  to  the  value  for  alphanumeric  literals  or numeric literals depending on the type of the UDDN. 15.24.20.3.3.  The number of literals may not be greater than the integer.  Although the dimension  of  a  UDDN  can  be  up  to  128  and  255  items,  there  is  a  physical  limiting factor on the number of values which can be placed in the VALUES ARE clause.  This limiting factor is an internal Phrase Table (PT), which limits the values to around 30 in number.  This does not limit the size of the table, just the number of initial values. 15.24.20.4.  General Rules. 15.24.20.4.1.  The DIMENSION verb must be included in the user's program before any reference to the UDDN. 15.24.20.4.2.  The DIMENSION verb is meaningful to the tokenization process only.  It produces no executable coding.  For this reason it may appear anywhere within the user's program within the limits stated in rule a, above.  It is recommended, however, to code it at the beginning of the program for ease of program maintenance. 15.24.20.4.3.  Other  references  to  the  UDDN  should  be  indexed  to  access  the  data within the table.  This index must have a positive integer value less than or equal to the integer from the DIMENSION verb. 15.24.20.4.4.  The  value  of  UDDN  (1)  will  be  preset  to  literal  no.1.    The  value  of UDDN, (2) will be preset to literal no. 2, etc.  These values may be changed during the execution of the program using the MOVE statement. 15.24.20.4.5.  If the number of literals is less than the integer, then the values of the highest occurrences of UDDN will not be preset and will need to be set by the program. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1619 15.24.20.4.5.1.

The  DROP  verb  makes  the  memory  space  used  by  a  UDDN available for other UDDN’s when one of the data names is no longer needed. 15.24.21.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.21.2.1.  DROP  UDDN; 15.24.21.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is described fully in the skeleton. 15.24.21.4.  General Rules. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1620 15.24.21.4.1.  Any data that had been previously moved to the UDDN will no longer be available. 15.24.21.4.2.  The  memory  space  assigned  to  the  UDDN  will  be  made  available  for reuse. 15.24.21.4.3.  Moving  data  to  the  UDDN  at  a  later  point  in  the  program  will  cause memory space to be reallocated. 15.24.21.4.3.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.21.4.3.1.1.  % VAR HAS NO DATA AND TAKES UP NO SPACE. 15.24.21.4.3.1.2.  MOVE ‘THIS IS SOME DATA‘ TO VAR; 15.24.21.4.3.1.3.  %  VAR  HAS  DATA  IN  IT  AND  TAKES  UP  17 CHARACTERS. 15.24.21.4.3.1.4.  DROP VAR; 15.24.21.4.3.1.5.  % VAR HAS NO DATA AND TAKES UP NO SPACE. 15.24.22.  MOVE Verb. 15.24.22.1.  Function.  The MOVE verb establishes a value for a SDDN or a UDDN.  It also  concatenates  alphanumeric  data,  manipulates  strings,  performs  mathematical calculations,  and  edits  dollar  sign,  decimal  point  and  comma  insertion  as  well  as  zero suppression. 15.24.22.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.45.  MOVE Skeleton.  15.24.22.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.24.22.3.1.  The UDDN or the SDDN may be subscripted or may be partialed. 15.24.22.3.2.  The EDITING clause may only be used when moving to an ANUDDN (see Edit Strings). 15.24.22.3.3.  The edit-string is an alphanumeric literal (in quotes) 15.24.22.4.  General Rules.  Numeric expressions, when evaluated, must yield a number between 999,999,999 and -999,999,999.  Decimal digits beyond seven digits to the right of the decimal  point will be dropped;  therefore calculations will only be  accurate to  six decimal places.  The seventh place can be used to determine which way to round the sixth. 15.24.22.4.1.  Alphanumeric Move. 15.24.22.4.1.1.  This  type  of  move  is  done  when  an  expression  resulting  in  an alphanumeric string is moved to an ANUDDN that has not been partialed. 15.24.22.4.1.2.  The  alphanumeric  string  resulting  from  evaluation  of  the AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1621 expression is moved to the UDDN. 15.24.22.4.1.3.  The  length  of  the  UDDN  is  adjusted  to  the  length  of  the  string moved to it. 15.24.22.4.2.  Alphanumeric Partial Move. 15.24.22.4.2.1.  This  type  of  move  is  done  when  an  expression  resulting  in  an alphanumeric string is moved to a partialed ANUDDN or a partialed or unpartialed SDDN. 15.24.22.4.2.2.  The  alphanumeric  string  resulting  from  evaluation  of  the expression is moved to the specific part of the UDDN or the specified part of the SDDN or the entire SDDN according to these rules: 15.24.22.4.2.2.1.  The length of the receiving item (the partialed UDDN or the partialed or unpartialed SDDN) is a fixed length. 15.24.22.4.2.2.2.  If the specified part of the receiving item does not exist (that is, the current length of the whole item is less that either the starting or ending character  of  the  partial)  then  an  error  results  and  the  program  is  terminated.  This is because the length of a partialed item is not adjusted by moving data to it. 15.24.22.4.2.2.3.  If  the  lengths  of  the  specified  part  of  the  receiving  item  is greater than the length of the alphanumeric string, then the string will be moved to  the  leftmost  characters  of  the  specified  part  of  the  receiving  item  and  the rightmost characters will be space filled. 15.24.22.4.2.2.4.  If the lengths are equal, the string will be moved to and will fill the specified part of the receiving item. 15.24.22.4.2.2.5.  If the length of the specified part of the receiving item is less than  the  length  of  the  alphanumeric  string,  then  the  specified  part  of  the receiving item will be filled, beginning with its leftmost character, continuing until  the  specified  part  of  the  receiving  item  is  filled.    An  execution  time warning will be printed. 15.24.22.4.3.  Alphanumeric to Numeric. 15.24.22.4.3.1.  This  type  of  move  is  done  when  an  expression  resulting  in  an alphanumeric string is moved to a numeric UDDN. 15.24.22.4.3.2.  If  the  resulting  alphanumeric  string  cannot  be  converted  into  a number, an error results and the program is terminated. 15.24.22.4.3.3.  In memory, the format of the numeric UDDN has a sign followed by exactly nine digits, a decimal point, and then seven decimal digits. 15.24.22.4.3.4.  If the alphanumeric string has more than seven digits to the right of the decimal point, the digits beyond the seventh will be dropped. 15.24.22.4.3.5.  If the alphanumeric string has no decimal point, then it is assumed to be to the right of the string's rightmost character. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1622 15.24.22.4.3.6.  The  sign  of  the  NUDDN  is  set  according  to  the  sign  in  the alphanumeric string.  If the string has no sign, it is assumed to be positive. 15.24.22.4.4.  Numeric Move.  This type of move is done when an expression results in a numeric value and that value is moved to a NUDDN. 15.24.22.4.5.  Numeric Edited Move. 15.24.22.4.5.1.  This  type  of  move  is  done  when  an  expression  resulting  in  a numeric value is moved to an ANUDDN. 15.24.22.4.5.2.  The  numeric  value  of  the  expression  is  used  to  generate  an alphanumeric string based on the edit string. 15.24.22.4.5.3.  The generated string is then moved to the UDDN whose length will be adjusted to the length of the generated string. 15.24.22.4.6.  Numeric to Alphanumeric Move. 15.24.22.4.6.1.  This  type  of  move  is  done  when  an  expression  resulting  in  a numeric value is moved to an unpartialed ANUDDN without editing. 15.24.22.4.6.2.  The  numeric  value  of  the  expression  is  used  to  generate  an alphanumeric  string.    The  string  will  have  a  minus  sign  as  the  first  character  (if negative) followed by 1 to 9 digits followed by a decimal point followed by 0 to 7 decimal  digits.   Leading  zeros on the right  will be suppressed (except  for a zero immediately to the left of the decimal point). 15.24.22.4.6.3.  The generated string is then moved to the UDDN whose length will be adjusted to the length of the generated string. 15.24.22.4.7.  Numeric Partial Move. 15.24.22.4.7.1.  This  type  of  move  is  done  when  an  expression  resulting  in  a numeric  value  is  moved  to  a  partialed  ANUDDN  or  a  partialed  or  unpartialed SDDN. 15.24.22.4.7.2.  The  numeric  value  is  converted  to  a  string.    This  string  will  not contain the sign of the value, the decimal point, or any digits that were to the right of the decimal point.  Leading zeros will be dropped. 15.24.22.4.7.3.  The generated string will then be moved according to the following rules: 15.24.22.4.7.3.1.  The length of the receiving item (the partialed UDDN or the partialed or unpartialed SDDN). 15.24.22.4.7.3.2.  If the specified part of the receiving item does not exist (that is, the current length of the whole item is less than either the starting or ending character of the partial) then an error results and the program is terminated. 15.24.22.4.7.3.3.  If the length of the receiving item is less than the length of the generated string an error results and the program is terminated. 15.24.22.4.7.3.4.  If the lengths are equal, then the string will be moved to and will fill the receiving item. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1623 15.24.22.4.7.3.5.  If the length of the receiving item is greater than the length of the generated string, then the string will be moved to the rightmost character of the receiving item and the leftmost characters will be zero filled. 15.24.22.4.7.3.6.  This type of move allows the programmer to create positive, whole numbers that can later be used for indexes, partials, or anything else that calls for positive, whole values. 15.24.22.4.8.  General Rules Applying to all Moves. 15.24.22.4.8.1.  Numeric  expressions,  when  evaluated,  must  yield  a  number between 999,999,999 and -999,999,999.  Decimal digits beyond seven digits to the right  of  the  decimal  point  will  be  dropped;  therefore,  calculations  will  only  be accurate to six decimal places.  The seventh place will be used to determine which way to round the sixth place. 15.24.22.4.8.2.  Alphanumeric  expressions,  when  evaluated,  must  yield  an alphanumeric string less than, or equal to 132 characters long. 15.24.23.  Edit Strings. 15.24.23.1.  Function.  Edit strings can be used when moving a numeric value (resulting from the evaluation of an expression) to an alphanumeric user-defined data item.  The edit string appears in the EDITING clause of a MOVE verb phrase.  It is used to accomplish zero suppression and insertion of the characters 0, comma, period, +, -, *, and $. 15.24.23.2.  Syntax. 15.24.23.2.1.  Edit field can be up to a maximum of 36 positions in length. 15.24.23.2.2.  The edit string is coded as an alphanumeric literal (enclosed in quotes) containing only the characters 9, 0, comma, period, +, -, *, $, and Z. 15.24.23.2.3.  There can only be one period anywhere.  If there is more than one plus or minus sign in the string, the Z's and asterisks may not be used.  The optional dollar sign must be the leftmost character. 15.24.23.2.4.  If there is only one dollar sign ($) in the string it must be the leftmost character in the string except for the optional plus (+) or minus (-). 15.24.23.2.5.  If there is more than one dollar sign ($) in the string, the Z's and asterisks (*) may not be used.  The dollar signs must be the leftmost characters except for the optional plus (+) or minus (-), but commas (,) may be embedded between the dollar signs. 15.24.23.2.6.  Z's and asterisks (*) may not be used in the same edit string. 15.24.23.2.7.  If Z's or asterisks (*) are used they must be the leftmost characters except for the optional plus (+) or minus (-) and a single optional dollar sign ($), but commas (,) may be embedded between the Z's or the asterisks. 15.24.23.2.8.  The only characters that may appear to the right of the decimal point in the edit string are 9 and 0. 15.24.23.3.  General Rules. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1624 15.24.23.3.1.  The numeric value and the edit string are lined up on the decimal points.  If there is no decimal point in the edit string it is assumed to be at the right of the string but does not cause decimal point insertion. 15.24.23.3.2.  An  alphanumeric  string  equal  in  length  to  the  edit  string  is  then  built according to the following rules: 15.24.23.3.2.1.  The decimal point in the edit string is put in the same place in the alphanumeric string as it is in the edit string. 15.24.23.3.2.2.  Working to the right from the decimal point, anywhere there is a “0”  in  the  edit  string  a  “0”  is  put  in  the  same  place  in  the  alphanumeric  string.  Anywhere there is a “9” in the edit string, the next decimal digit to the right of the decimal  point in  the numeric value is  put  in  the same place in  the  alphanumeric string as where the “9” is in the edit string.  If there is no next decimal digit, it is assumed to be “0”. 15.24.23.3.2.3.  If there are no “Z's” or asterisks (*) and one or no dollar sign ($) to the left  of the decimal  point in the edit string, then creation of the alphanumeric string proceeds to the left from the decimal point as follows:  Wherever there is a “0”, a comma (,), a plus (+), a minus (-), or a dollar sign ($) in the edit string that character is inserted in the same place in the alphanumeric string as it appears in the edit string.  Wherever there is a “9” in the edit string the next digit to the left of the decimal point in the numeric value is put in the same place in the alphanumeric string as the “9” is in the edit string.  If there is no next digit it is assumed to be “0”.  A plus (+) in the edit string causes the sign of the numeric value (+ or -) to be put in the alphanumeric string in the same place as the plus (+) is in the edit string.  A minus (-) acts the same as a plus (+) except that positive numeric values cause a space instead of a plus to be put in the alphanumeric string. 15.24.23.3.2.4.  If  there  are  any  "Z's"  or  asterisks  (*),  pluses(+),  minuses  (-)  or multiple  dollar  signs  in  the  edit  string  then  editing  proceeds,  as  outlined  in  the subparagraph  above  except  "Z's",  asterisks  (*),  and  the  second  and  subsequent dollar signs ($) are treated as 9's and then zero suppression and replacement take place according to these rules: 15.24.23.3.2.4.1.  The first character eligible for suppression is determined to be the character in the alphanumeric string being built in the same place as the first  Z,  asterisk  (*),  or  comma  (,)  or  the  second  plus,  minus  or  dollar  sign, whichever comes first in the edit string. 15.24.23.3.2.4.2.  The last character eligible for suppression is determined to be the character in the alphanumeric string in the same place as the character just before the first 0, 9, or period in the edit string. 15.24.23.3.2.4.3.  If the edit string character used to indicate suppression is a Z or  an  asterisk  (*)  then  all  0's  and  commas,  starting  from  the  first  character eligible for suppression, will be changed to spaces (Z) or asterisks.  Suppression and  replacement  will  stop  after  the  last  character  eligible  for  suppression  is suppressed or before suppressing a character other than a 0 or a comma. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1625 15.24.23.4.  If  the  edit  string  character  used  to  indicate  suppression  is  a  plus,  minus  or dollar sign, then suppression will be done as stated for suppression character “Z”.  After suppression  is  complete,  the  single  remaining  plus,  minus  or  dollar  sign  in  the alphanumeric string will be moved to the position in the alphanumeric string of the last character suppressed (if any). 15.24.23.4.1.  EXAMPLES: 15.24.23.4.1.1.  To insert commas and a decimal point: 15.24.23.4.1.1.1.

Section 15AE—-Program Execution Control Verbs 15.24.24.  Purpose.  To define the verbs which control the program execution sequence. 15.24.25.  DO Verb. 15.24.25.1.  Function.  The DO verb executes a subroutine as if it were coded at the point of the DO verb. 15.24.25.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.25.2.1.  DO  subroutine-name; 15.24.25.3.  Syntax Rules.  Subroutine-name is the name of a construct, without the colon (:), which fits the definition of a subroutine. 15.24.25.4.  General Rules.  The subroutine will be executed and then program control will be returned to the statement following the DO. 15.24.25.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.25.4.1.1.  A:  SEQUENCE 15.24.25.4.1.2.  PRINT ‘START #1’; 15.24.25.4.1.3.  DO B; 15.24.25.4.1.4.  PRINT ‘END #3’; 15.24.25.4.1.5.  A:  END 15.24.25.4.1.6.  B:  REPEAT 2 TIMES 15.24.25.4.1.7.  PRINT ‘SUBROUTINE #2’; 15.24.25.4.1.8.

NULL Verb. 15.24.26.1.  Function.  This verb performs no executable function and is used as a place holder  only.    Typically,  this  verb  would  be  used  in  a  choice  (CHOOSE)  construct  to indicate no action for certain conditions. 15.24.26.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.26.2.1.  NULL; 15.24.26.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is defined fully in the skeleton. 15.24.26.4.  General Rules. 15.24.26.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.26.4.1.1.  A: CHOOSE SD = ‘01’ 15.24.26.4.1.2.

This  verb  is  used  to  stop  processing  in  the  ASSUME  leg  of  an assumption/admission construct and to process the ADMIT leg. 15.24.27.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.27.2.1.  QUIT  construct-name; 15.24.27.3.  Syntax Rules. 15.24.27.3.1.  The  construct-name  must  be  the  name  of  an  assumption/admission construct, without the colon (:). 15.24.27.4.  General Rules. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1629 15.24.27.4.1.  The  QUIT  must  be  within  the  ASSUME  leg  (or  within  a  subroutine unique to the ASSUME leg) of the assumption/admission construct being QUIT. 15.24.27.4.2.  The  QUIT  would  normally  appear  within  a  choice  construct  nested within  the  ASSUME  leg  of  an  assumption/admission  construct.    This  allows  for conditional termination of the ASSUME leg. 15.24.27.4.3.  Upon execution of the QUIT verb processing in the ASSUME leg of the assumption/admission construct will be stopped and the ADMIT leg will be processed.  The program will continue to process as if the ASSUME leg had never been processed; that  is,  as  if  the  ADMIT  leg  had  been  processed  when  the  program  reached  the assumption/admission construct. 15.24.27.4.4.  The  ADMIT  leg  of  the  assumption/admission  construct  should  be programmed to undo the processing done by the ASSUME leg up to where the QUIT occurred. 15.24.27.4.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.27.4.4.1.1.  SEE ASSUME/ADMIT CONSTRUCT 15.24.28.  STOP Verb. 15.24.28.1.  Function.  The STOP verb stops execution of the program and closes all open files. 15.24.28.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.28.2.1.  STOP; 15.24.28.3.  Syntax  Rules.    In  order  for  the  STOP  verb  to  function  as  a  program  STOP image and not as an ECL STOP image, in the 801 runstream, the word "STOP" must not be placed in columns one through four of an image (reference runstream consideration). 15.24.28.4.  General Rules. 15.24.28.4.1.  Upon execution of this verb all open files are closed (reference CLOSE verb) and the program ends in an orderly fashion. 15.24.28.4.2.  The  program  will  end  in  the  same  manner  after  completing  the  main program construct even if no STOP verb is coded. 15.24.28.4.2.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.28.4.2.1.1.

MAIN-PROGRAM:  END        % --- instead of here. 15.24.29.  Purpose.  To define the MISC verbs. 15.24.30.  DUMP Verb. 15.24.30.1.  Function.  The DUMP verb creates a disk file containing a complete copy of all tokenized instructions, the contents of all data items, and all internal pointers so that a formatted listing for debugging can be produced. 15.24.30.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.30.2.1.  DUMP; 15.24.30.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is defined fully in the skeleton. 15.24.30.4.  General Rules. 15.24.30.4.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.30.4.1.1.

It exists only to allow  comments  to  be  inserted  within  a  program  construct  in  the  source  code.    It  is  a programmer aid and is used for documentation. 15.24.31.2.  Skeleton. 15.24.31.2.1.  REM  comment-entry ; 15.24.31.3.  Syntax Rules.  None; the syntax is defined fully in the skeleton. 15.24.31.4.  General Rules. 15.24.31.4.1.  The REM verb phrase is like any other phrase in that it begins with the verb “REM” and must end with a semicolon (;).  Also, it may appear only where other AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1631 verb phrases are allowed (within a CONSTRUCT) and may not appear in the middle of another verb phrase. 15.24.31.4.2.  The REM verb phrase differs from other verb phrases in that everything between REM and the semicolon (;) is ignored.  Reserved words and the percent sign (%)  may  be  used  anywhere  within  the  comment-entry  but  will  not  have  their  usual effect. 15.24.31.4.2.1.  EXAMPLE: 15.24.31.4.2.1.1.

The SORT verb is used to arrange a disk file in either ascending or descending order. 15.24.32.2.  Skeleton. Figure 15.46.  SORT Skeleton. 15.24.32.2.1.  Syntax Rules.  AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1632 15.24.32.2.1.1.  The filename is one of the internal disk filenames. 15.24.32.2.1.2.  The  key-expressions  are  pairs  of  positive  integers,  separated  by commas, with no spaces in between. 15.24.32.2.1.3.  Up to 64 key-expressions can be specified, not to exceed a total of 64 characters in all keys added together. 15.24.32.3.  General Rules. 15.24.32.3.1.  The key-expressions point to the fields within each record to be used in determining the order of the file.  The first number in the key is the starting character and the second is  the ending character of the key.  For example, the key-expression “32, 35” would specify the key field to be the 32nd, 33rd, 34th, and 35th character of each disk record. 15.24.32.3.2.  If ASCENDING or DESCENDING is not specified, then whichever was specified  last  will  be  assumed.    If  neither  has  been  specified  in  the  program, ASCENDING is assumed. 15.24.32.3.3.  Keys are specified in order of importance.  Key-expression-1 is the major sort key, the last key is the minor sort key. 15.24.32.3.4.  The sort treats all fields as alphanumeric and uses the ASCII collating sequence. 15.24.32.3.5.  Errors in the sort will cause the program to terminate. 15.24.32.3.6.  Sort  will  abort  if  no  records  are  on  the  file  to  be  sorted.    It  is  the programmer's responsibility to ensure there are records to be sorted. 15.24.32.3.7.  A DESCENDING order sort takes the “one’s compliment” of the data in the sort field, and then sorts that complimented data.  Some special characters cannot be “one’s complimented” without causing error termination. 15.25.  Error Message Definitions. 15.25.1.  Purpose.

Overview.  This chapter contains a brief resume of all the programs used in the Standard Base Supply System ADS.  Sec. 16B lists programs in numerical sequence with a brief resume of their  purpose  and  function.    Detailed  operating  procedures  and  instructions  for  Computer Operations are outlined in AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt, Ch 5 and 6, and this part.  Note:  Information regarding Fuels and Munitions is retained for reference purposes only. Section 16B—-Program Resumes. 16.2.  Program Number Assignment. 16.2.1.  USAF Programs.  Standard system code/ADS identifier GV is assigned to the SBSS.  The  NGV  prefix  serves  to  control  SBSS  related  documentation  and  software  during distribution  phases.    Since  implementation,  follow-on  enhancements  have  required  some variation in the internal handling of unique application routines.  SBSS programs applicable to the batch processing mode (twilight/reports) appear on the Program Bank Index (PBI) with a NGV prefix. 16.2.2.  A  given  program,  such  as  933,  requires  separately  mapped  ABSOLUTES  to accommodate different processing mode demands.  The standard SBLC (SBSS/NGV) program identification numbers assigned for SBSS applications consist of six alphanumeric characters and are assigned to the following categories/subcategories: Table 16.1.  Categories for Program Identification Numbers. PROGRAM-ID  NUMBER CATEGORY NGV000 RESERVED NGV001-NGV050  General purpose and software application utility programs which are primarily used for SBLC Computer support operations. NGV051-NGV099  Specialized SBSS application utility programs which are primarily used for direct support of USAF Materiel Management operations. NGV100-NGV199  Special purpose and one-time application utility programs that are used for one-time SBSS file conversion, maintenance, or other infrequent applications. NGV200-NGV299  Applications support and supervisory programs. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1644 NGV300-NGV399  Recurring specialized and utility programs for AFMC SCM-R Information Technology Activity.

Major Command Programs.  Programs designed and developed by major commands are  assigned  five-character  identification  numbers.    These  numbers  are  assigned  in  the following standard format: Table 16.2.  Major Command Program Identification Numbers. ID NUMBER OF TYPE  POSITIONS CHARACTER DESIGNATION 3 1 2 Alpha Alpha System Code (NGV) Major Command Code (AFH 23-123, Vol 1, Ch 2) Numeric Program Identification Number 16.2.4.  Training Programs.  Those programs designed and developed for formal AFMC SCM-R  INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY  ACTIVITY,  Air  Training  and  Education  Command (AETC), or Major Command programmer training courses will be assigned six alpha character identification numbers. 16.3.  Utility Programs (NGV000 THROUGH NGV099). 16.3.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  direct  support  of  USAF  Materiel  Management  operations,  to include database verification, scanning, rehoming, and maintaining base constants. 16.3.2.  Programs  NGV003,  NGV003A,  and  NGV003B.    Programs  (NGV003,  NGV003A, NGV003B) are referred to as the Supply User Report Generator (SURGE).  They allow users to access the database in a read-only mode to produce reports on selected data.  SURGE can also be used as a stand-alone program to manipulate data files produced by QLP, other SURGE programs, or Materiel Management programs, and then produce reports and other disk files. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1645 16.3.2.1.  NGV003.  This program reads the SURGE source code, written by the Materiel Management  user,  and  converts  it  to  a  form  that  can  be  read  by  the  SURGE  compiler (NGV003A)  which  is  written  in  COBOL.    This  program  also  reads  the  options  on  the SURGE select card and controls the appropriate response. 16.3.2.2.  NGV003A.    This  program  compiles  the  SURGE  source  code  provided  by NGV003 above and compiles it down into an intermediate programming language referred to as “Tokens”.  A compiler, by definition, converts a few simple English type words into many instructions.  Each Token is a simple primitive instruction.  The tokens are saved in a MSAM file for use by the executor (NGV003B).  This program is written in COBOL. 16.3.2.3.  NGV003B.  This  program  reads the Token file provided by NGV003A above and executes them as necessary, and in the order required, to accomplish the original intent of the SURGE user/programmer.  Each Token directs this COBOL program to do a specific piece  of  code  which  performs  math,  read  files,  reads  the  database,  branch  for  loops, repetition, and decisions, print reports, and all the other various things that SURGE can do. 16.3.3.  NGV020.  This program computes the Inventory Balance and stores the results in 022-FILLER-1.    If  different,  move  the  computed  Inventory  Balance  to  022-FILLER-1.    The program  should also  output a discrepancy list  in  column format.  The program  will display ‘NO DISCREPANCIES DETECTED’ if there are no discrepancies. 16.3.4.  NGV024.  Item Record and Repair Cycle Record Link Check provides the RPS with the capability to verify that a repair cycle record exists for each XD or XF type item record or that an XD or XF type item record exists for each repair cycle record.  The program provides a listing of errors detected, by type, and reflects the data contents of the record. 16.3.5.  NGV027.  Fail Safe provides the RPS operator with the ability to produce counts of basic records and detail records on the SBSS database.  Selective edits are also performed on the item records and detail records.  If an error occurs, the database key, contents, and error type are printed along with the counts. 16.3.6.  NGV028.  Satellite Rehoming Download provides the capability to transfer selective satellite records to tape for rehoming actions.  The records selected for processing based on the system designator(s) requested are:  item, detail, authorized/in-use detail, repair cycle, fuels gains/loss, ARMS, inventory accuracy, routing identifier, and fuels management records.  The option exists to convert data elements in the item, detail, repair cycle, and authorized/in-use records according to the option in the parameter image. 16.3.7.  NGV029.  Support Record Downloader/Uploader downloads to tape 11 different types of  basic  support  records,  and  it  will  upload  these  records  to  a  newly  created  SBSS  Host Account.  The tape created by the download must be used for this upload. 16.3.8.  NGV030.  Satellite Rehoming Upload provides the capability to load selective records to the SBSS database from the rehoming tape generated by program NGV028.  When the same stock number, but different system designator, is previously loaded, the common data elements on  the  item  record  are  transferred  to  the  record  being  loaded.    A  printout  will  be  produced indicating the number of records loaded and any reject notices that may be generated. 16.3.9.  NGV031.    Change  Stock  Record  Account  Number  scans  the  ITMDTL-AREA, REPCYC-AREA, PRTNBR-AREA, ATHINU-AREA, and ISG-AREA of the SBSS database AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1646 for  item  records,  repair  cycle  records,  part  number  detail,  authorized/in-use  detail,  and interchangeable  and  substitute  group  records  when:    there  is  a  directed  change  to  SBSS database records for a stock record account number SRAN and/or there is a directed change to SBSS  database  detail  record  (DIFM,  special  level,  and  WRM  WCDO  spares  detail)  major command codes within a specified system designator. 16.3.10.  NGV032.  Download Bypass Record Area downloads all batch related items to the bypass record area of the secondary database at the end of each successful batch processing cycle. 16.3.11.  NGV033.  Upload Bypass Record Area reloads all batch related items in the bypass record area downloaded by program NGV032 to the secondary database record area at the start of each batch processing cycle. 16.3.12.  NGV040.    New  Host  Record  Loader  builds  and  initializes  the  necessary  records required to establish an SBSS host/bare base account. 16.3.13.  NGV041.  CTH Record Download (UTL041) downloads and/or deletes consolidated transaction history (CTH) records and writes them to magnetic tape.  Download may be for a single date or a range of dates (not to exceed 31 day span). 16.3.14.  NGV042.    CTH  Record  Verification  (UTL042)  verifies  (counts)  the  number  of consolidated transaction history records on the database.  Verification may be for a single date, a range of dates or all dates on the database. 16.3.15.  NGV043.  CTH Record Upload (UTL043) reads magnetic tapes created by program UTL041 and loads the records from the magnetic tape to the consolidated transaction history (CTH) area on the database. 16.3.16.  NGV061.  Document NBR Cleanup deletes Document NBR (103) records that are owners of an empty set. 16.3.17.  NGV068A.  Base Constants Load provides each LRS function with the capability to determine each base requirement for input and output processing.  The base constant elements are assigned at base level and loaded to Multi-Sequential Access Method (MSAM) files by this program.  This data is passed to programs NGV269 and NGV068B for database updates. 16.3.18.  NGV068B.    Base  Constants/Terminal  Load  provides  the  LRS  function  with  the capability  to  reload  the  Base  Constants/Terminal  MSAM  data  files  to  the  database.    If  any errors occur, correct and verify the MSAM files with NGV068A and reprocess NGV068B. 16.3.19.  NGV068C.  Batch Base Terminal Data Load provides each Base Level function with the  capability  to  re-create  corrupt  Multi-sequential  Access  Method  (MSAM)  terminal  data files. 16.3.20.  NGV068D.  Base Constants Conversion Program converts the constants and support data file to proper format.  Process only when directed by AFMC SCM-R INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACTIVITY. 16.3.21.  NGV070.  Rehome Cleanup.  This program deletes the records of a satellite that has transferred (rehomed) to another base. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1647 16.3.22.  NGV071.    Stock  Number  User  Directory  Reconciliation  reads  the  item  records sequentially and identifies those item records with SNUD eligibility.  A SNUD reconciliation record (BDF/BVA) is written to file for each stock number selected. 16.3.23.  NGV073.    AFMC/SNUD  Annual  Reconciliation  provides  for  processing  annual SNUD  reconciliation  data  received  from  AFMC.    Program  reads  AFMC  file  and  places transactions in three disc files depending on document identifiers (DICs). 16.3.24.  NGV075.    Munitions  Cleanup.    This  program  deletes  only  the  munitions  (type account K) item, detail, and other munitions records from the specified system designator in the select image.  Munitions management records are not deleted.  These records are required for end-of-year close-out processing. 16.3.25.  NGV076.  Defense Base Operating Fund (DBOF) Flag Change.  This program will set the DBOF flag to on or off on the 311, 518, 201, and 202 records.  Must be processed as required. 16.4.  Applications Support and Utility Programs (NGV200 Through NGV299 and NGVU02 through NGVS33). 16.4.1.  Purpose.    To  provide  the  interface  between  Materiel  Management  application programs and the S2200 mainframe executive system. 16.4.2.  NGV202.

Octal to Decimal and Reverse - This program converts octal values to decimal and decimal to octal values. 16.4.11.  NGV205H.    Thirty-  To  One  Hundred  Twenty  -Minute  Inline  Output  -  Inline programs store output to either a 30- or 120- minute database area.  NGV205H retrieves every 30  minutes  and  produces  the  output  images  from  the  30-minute  database  area.    Every  120 minutes, the program produces the images in the 120-minute database area. 16.4.12.  NGV207.  RPS Operator/SBSS Communication Interface Batch Processor - Program NGV207  is  called  by  program  NGV207B  to  start  all  SIFS  batch  jobs  when  END  card  has processed.  It also starts  program NGV203 to query the MORE processor for redirection of suspended inputs. 16.4.13.  NGV207B.    RPS  Operator/SBSS  Communication  Interface  -  Program  NGV207B processes the END select  image which terminates the inline mode and initiates the twilight mode.    In  this  mode,  no  input  transactions  will  be  accepted  from  the  inline  terminals.    To provide the RPS/main site operator the capacity to initialize or override the base constants-2 record (terminal data), program NGV207B processes the COM REM input transaction.  With this transaction, the operator can initialize one or all terminals UP, mark a terminal DOWN, place a terminal in RECEIVE mode only, place a terminal in OUTPUT mode only, with its AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1649 output rerouted to the RPS/main printer and reroute a terminal's output to any desired output function number. 16.4.14.  NGV208A.    SBSS  Functional  System  Analyzer  (FSA)  -  Program  NGV208A processes all inline transactions entered via Pseudo Reader, NGV208B, program NGV324 and any TIP/TIWADS device.  The program determines which inline program must process the input  transaction.    NGV208A  passes  this  information  and  the  transaction  to  NGV209A  for processing. 16.4.15.  NGV208B.    SBSS  Requirements  Driver  -  NGV208B  drives  the  releveling  and follow-up process by creating the appropriate LVL or FUP inline transaction and passing it to NGV208A  processing  and  submission  to  NGV208A.    This  continues  until  releveling  and follow-up is complete. 16.4.16.  NGV209A.  Inline Driver serves as the communication link between the programs required to process the SBSS transactions.  They perform the program calls.  They also strip and align data in an 80-position format from a filled- in screen. 16.4.17.  NGV209S.    DPS  Screen  Handler  serves  as  a  DPS  Screen  Handler  for  any  screen request. 16.4.18.  NGV210.    SBSS  Initialization  Routine  provides  the  RPS/main  site  operator  the capability  to  initialize the  SBSS system for  either inline or off-line processing.   Depending upon the settings of the control flags on the special control record and the codes in the INT transaction, program NGV210 accomplishes the following four types of initialization: 16.4.18.1.  Beginning of day (BOD). 16.4.18.2.  Restart inline. 16.4.18.3.  Restart off-line. 16.4.18.4.  Restart beginning-of-day. 16.4.18.5.  Initializing the SBSS system consists primarily of setting the appropriate flags ON/OFF in the special control record and initializing the base constants-2 record.  When the  base  constants-2  record  is  initialized,  all  terminals  are  logically  placed  in  an  UP  or DOWN  status  with  all  override  function  numbers  removed.    When  the  initialization  is complete, program NGV210 will produce a 725 reject notice on the RPS/main site console. 16.4.19.  NGV211A/B.  End-Of-Transaction Online/Batch is responsible for performing the following functions for all inline and batch programs. 16.4.19.1.  Transfer  of  output  data  (documents  REJ/MGT  notices,  alternate  print/output files) generated by the inline or batch process to the output function or area designated to receive the output data. 16.4.19.2.  Assignment of transaction serial numbers and the writing of transaction history records to the SBSS database record area (DBRA). 16.4.19.3.  Logging  of  audit  trail  data  generated  by  the  inline  batch  and  program NGV211A/B to the system log file. 16.4.19.4.

Sample Inventory Processing uses the 1RS/1RR inputs after the RPTR17 has been processed.  The count images (1RS) are input, and the physical count quantity and the record balance are compared (including -9 records).  The following actions occur: 16.6.86.1.  Count record (1RS) is unequal.  If count quantity and item record/detail quantity are unequal, an inventory recount image (1RR) is produced. 16.6.86.2.  Count/Recount record (1RS/1RR) is equal.  If the count or recount quantity and item  record/detail  quantity are equal,  the freeze code C is  removed, and the date of last inventory is updated on the item record/detail record. 16.6.86.3.  Recount record (1RR) is unequal.  When the 1RR is reinput, the item record balance is updated with the input quantity, the C freeze code is removed, the applicable inventory accuracy record is updated, and a transaction history (IAD) is created. 16.6.87.  NGV536.    FSC/MMC  Record  Load/Change,  Delete  provides  the  ability  to  load, change, or delete FSC and MMC records.  These inputs are received from AFMC. 16.6.88.  NGV538.

LOGMARS FCS Match and Input Data Record Handler matches the FCS image file created by RPTR36 against the FCS input images.  If the records match, the records are sent to the pseudo reader to be processed.  If the records do not match, the record is flagged with the appropriate validation flag to show why the record/input was mismatched.  A listing is  printed  in  warehouse  location  sequence  of  the  mismatched  records.    Records  with  a validation flag of I (HHT input with no FCS image), R (warehouse location not within range), and Y (validated record) are deleted from the database. (See AFH 23-123, Vol 2, Pt 2, Ch 6 for processing procedures.) 16.6.90.  NGV543.

Lateral Requisitioning provides bases with the capability to forward either stock replenishment or due-out requisitions, except ammunition, to another SBSS activity for possible redistribution of assets.  The program provides the options to fill or kill, back order, or pass the requisition to the original source. 16.7.28.  NGV635.    Shipment  Analysis  provides  for  directed  shipments,  non-directed shipments, and the processing of selected related inputs.  Inputs consist of distribution/referral orders, lateral support, automatic returns, and receipt acknowledgment follow-ups.  Edits are performed on the input data elements to determine if the transaction will process. 16.7.29.  NGV636.  Shipment, Non-Directed completes processing on SHP inputs.  The edits consist  of  document  number  and  supplementary  address.    On  inputs  with  a  blank supplementary address, a check is made for shipment override record or a shipment destination code on the repair cycle record.  It also produces appropriate documents and creates various images as output responses. 16.7.30.  NGV637.    Shipment,  Redistribution  Order  and  Image  Processing  processes document identifier codes A2(x) A4(x).  The input priority, document number, and condition code  are  used  in  determining  the  maximum  quantity  to  be  shipped.    If  the  requested  stock number is not available for redistribution of serviceable assets, interchangeable stock numbers are screened for availability.  When MSK and/or supply point details exist, another asset notice is produced in preference to a denial (B7x) if input quantity cannot be shipped from serviceable balance.  If the requested item or interchangeable item is not available on either the item record or  supply  point  detail,  denial  images  B7(x)  are  produced  for  transmission  to  the  applicable inventory managers.  Input of an RDO for unserviceable items only screens the input stock number, and if not available, prepares B7(x) denial action.  If the item is available, a DD Form 1348-1A is produced on the appropriate warehouse terminal and a transaction history created for the item record decrease.  The repair cycle record is updated, if applicable. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1673 16.7.31.  NGV638.

File  Status  Excess  is  a  dependent  program  which  is  activated  by  the releveling  process.    It  prepares  excess  report  images,  establishes  excess  detail  records,  and produces forced excess review or TRM images as appropriate. 16.7.63.  NGV730.    Requisitioning  for  Due-Outs  determines  requisition  action  for  due-out conditions.  If the maximum automatic obligation/urgency of need on the materiel acquisition control record suppresses requisitioning, a fund requirement image is output.  Requisitioning action is accomplished by interface with program NGV733. 16.7.64.  NGV731.    Requisitioning  for  Stock  Replenishment  determines  action  required  for stock  replenishment  requisitioning.    Fund  requirement  images  (FRC)  are  produced  if  the requisitioning action is suppressed by stockage priority code, maximum automatic obligation, or  stockage  priority  subgroup  code.    Requisition  action  is  accomplished  by  interface  with program NGV733, when not suppressed. 16.7.65.  NGV732.  Requisitioning/Fund Requirement Image Reinput causes a requisition to be produced through interface and establishes a due-in detail record.  It also produces FRC or 1SH image(s) when required.  If the FRC is for a due-out detail record, the due-out detail memo flag is changed to zero (firm due-out). 16.7.66.  NGV733.

NGV971.  A&F Monetary Load/Change/Delete.  Loads and deletes fund targets, and changes  indicative  data  contained  in  A&F  Monetary.    It  builds  and  writes  Transaction Histories, loads, and deletes Billing Variable Records.  The process is triggered by the TTPC contained in the input. 16.9.57.  NGV972.    Stock  Fund  On-Order  In-Transit,  Payable  List  (M01).    This  program provides the current position of the SMAG on-order and in-transit inventories and liabilities at any given time.  At EOM, this program analyzes the Stock Fund Detail Records and updates the appropriate On-Order, In-Transit, and Payable General Ledger (ZTR) accumulators by the Trial Balance reporting SRAN for all divisions of the A&F SMAG.  Processing report select image RPTM01 activates this program.  The program reads the Item Record area and classifies or sorts the related Due-In shipped status, BNR, RNB, and SNC details into the Stock-Fund Division group based on the Fund Code in the applicable Detail Record.  It then segregates Budget Code 6 between ground fuels and aviation fuels, based upon the Item Record Materiel Category Code.  It provides separate reports ZTR accumulator updates for ground and aviation fuels.  At EOM, program NGV982/M12 creates separate ZTR images with SRAN Fzxxxx for ground fuels and SRAN FPxxxx for aviation fuel. 16.9.58.  NGV973.

Stock  Fund  Inventory  Management  Report  (M18)  provides  primary SMAG managers with  a  year-to-date output product  showing operating results.  It  provides major  command  and  division  managers  with  SF  inventory  management  reports,  computes mathematically accuracy of each SFIMR, makes adjustments, and produces M18 report images for  submission  to  major  commands  and  division  inventory  managers.    The  M18  program produces three separate data files containing SMAG Manager Inventory Management Report images.    One  file  is  interfaced  by  the  Business  Funds  Branch  into  the  Standard  Materiel Accounting  system  (BJ).    It  is  used  by  (BJ)  ADS  to  create  the  stock  Fund  IMR/GLA Reconciliation List (see DFAS-DE7077.4-M).  File two is used by the SMAG manager.  File three,  if  produced,  contains  Stock  Fund  Inventory  Adjustment  Transactions  (M18)  GLA transactions.    This  file  will  be  interfaced  into  the  (BJ)  system.    All  three  files  will  use  the Automatic  Data  Report  Submission  System  (ADRSS)  Search  and  Move  (SAM)  table  for interfacing to other ADSs.  See DFAS-DE 7077.10-M.  Note:  The M18 is no longer processed in the SBSS, however it has not been deleted from the SBSS program library. AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1698 16.9.62.  NGV977.

All AFH23-123V2PT2  8 AUGUST 2013 1699 interface files, TQ/BQ or OY, are transferred using the Automatic Data Report Submission System (ADRSS) Search and Move (SAM) table to send the file and the receiving ADS uses  the  ADRSS  Collect  Incoming  Data  (CID)  table  to  rename  them  to  the  appropriate receiving ADS qualifier and filename.  At EOD, this program produces daily transaction images, daily control images, and prints daily control lists showing detail transactions and related management notices.  This program is activated by processing report select image RPTD12.  It checks the A&F Sequence Control Record to verify that the NGV980/D07 and NGV969/D11 have already been processed, and if not, the program is rejected. 16.9.69.2.  The Monthly Program (M12) provides interface products for updating the Stock Fund Records maintained in the Standard Materiel Accounting System (SMAS) BQ and General  Fund  Records  maintained  in  the  General  Funds  General  Ledger  (GAFS)  BQ system.    The  stock  fund  interface  file  is  transferred  using  the  Automatic  Data  Report Submission  System  (ADRSS)  Search  and  Move  (SAM)  table  to  send  the  file.    The receiving ADS uses the ADRSS Collect Incoming Data (CID) table to rename the file to a (BJ) SMAS qualifier and filename.  The General Funds Records interface file is transferred using the Automatic Data Report Submission System (ADRSS) Search and Move (SAM) table to send the file.  The receiving ADS uses the ADRSS Collect Incoming Data (CID) table  to  rename  the  file  to  a  (BQ)  General  Accounting  and  Finance  System  (GAFS) qualifier  and  filename.    At  EOM,  the  program  produces  summary  images  and  monthly control images and prints control listings.  This program is activated by processing report select  image  RPTM12.    It  checks  the  A&F  Sequence  Control  Record  to  verify  that  the NGV982/D12 and NGV972/M01 have already been processed, and if not, the program is rejected. 16.9.70.  NGV984.
