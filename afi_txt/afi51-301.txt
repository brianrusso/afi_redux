Responsibilities of The Judge Advocate General (TJAG). TJAG responsibilities are as written inthis instruction and must be consistent with Secretary of the Air Force Orders 111.1, Functions and Dutiesof the General Counsel, April 26, 1999, and 111.5, Delineation of Responsibilities of the General Counseland the Judge Advocate General, October 30, 1997. Those acting on behalf of TJAG (such as the variouscivil litigation divisions in the Air Force Legal Services Agency [AFLSA] and the International and Oper-ations Law Division [HQ USAF/JAI]) may perform the functions detailed in paragraph 1.1.3. Addition-ally: 1.1.1.  Commands subordinate to HQ USAF and AFLSA must not initiate or take any action pertain-ing to these responsibilities unless TJAG specifically authorizes them. 1.1.2.  Commands and judge advocates should make every effort to identify causes of action in favorof the United States and promptly notify the proper division in the office of TJAG or AFLSA. 1.1.3.  The Judge Advocate General, in coordination with the Office of the Air Force General Counsel(SAF/GC): 1.1.3.1.  Protects the interests of the United States Air Force in legal and administrative proceed-ings in the United States and foreign countries. 1.1.3.2.  Maintains close liaison with the Department of Justice (DoJ) to: 1.1.3.2.1.  Obtain evidence to support the government's position. 1.1.3.2.2.  Prepare pleadings and briefs. 1.1.3.2.3.  Compile and evaluate evidence. 1.1.3.2.4.  Litigate or assist in the litigation of civil cases. 1.1.3.3.  Makes Air Force recommendations about: 1.1.3.3.1.  Initiating legal actions and appeals in domestic and foreign courts in significant AirForce cases. (Except for appeals involving Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals cases). 1.1.3.3.2.  Accepting proposed compromises or settlements of pending litigation or controver-sies in significant Air Force cases, including those in foreign countries. 1.1.3.4.  Coordinates closely with other Department of Defense (DoD) agencies, the GeneralAccounting Office (GAO), and other federal agencies in procuring evidence to support the gov-ernment's position. 1.1.3.5.  Negotiates and presents evidence, pleadings, and briefs to federal, state, and municipalregulatory bodies in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. 1.1.4.  The appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI, on behalf of TJAG, ordi-narily determines who may appear as an attorney or counsel for the Air Force in a civil judicial oradministrative action (foreign or domestic). As a matter of written Air Force legal policy, as estab-lished by TJAG or SAF/GC, there may already be existing delegation for installation level judgeadvocates and attorneys to appear on behalf of the Air Force before certain administrative bodies. In8AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002cases where direct representation of the United States before a state, federal or foreign court isinvolved, the concurrence of DoJ may be required. 1.1.5.  No person on active duty with the Air Force, or employed in a civilian or reserve capacity bythe Air Force, may appear or represent any individual, corporation, association, or other outside entityas their attorney or counsel in a civil judicial or administrative action (foreign or domestic) without thewritten permission of TJAG or TJAG’s designee. 1.2.  Representing the Air Force and Air Force Officials Sued in Their Official Capacities. DoJ hasthe statutory responsibility to represent the Air Force and Air Force officials who are being sued in theirofficial capacities (Title 28, United States Code, Sections 516-519). This responsibility extends to litiga-tion in foreign courts. (However, see Title 10, United States Code, Section 1037 and AR 27-50/SEC-NAVINST 5820.4G/AFJI 51-706, Status Of Forces Policies, Procedures, And Information, 15 December1989.) 1.2.1.  Occasionally, this responsibility is delegated entirely to TJAG. 1.2.2.  When the Attorney General is served a copy of a complaint, DoJ formally requests that theappropriate AFLSA civil litigation division send a litigation report to the attorney defending the AirForce official. 1.2.3.  Installation staff judge advocates (SJAs) or other Air Force officials gather the specific infor-mation and documents to comply with DoJ requests, and forward such information and documents tothe appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI. 1.3.  Requests by Air Force Officials for Representation by DoJ. Past or present Air Force personnelor employees who are named as individual defendants for personal liability in civil or criminal proceed-ings for acts or omissions arising from the performance of their official Air Force duties may request rep-resentation by DoJ (see Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 50.15, and 50.16). NOTE:Because personnel sued in their personal capacity may have as little as twenty (20) days to respondto a complaint, time is of the essence in processing these requests. 1.3.1.  DoJ will not defend an individual against a federal criminal action. 1.3.2.  Under certain circumstances, Air Force contractors being sued by third parties may also requestgovernment representation. 1.3.3.  An individual who wants government representation: 1.3.3.1.  Writes a request (see Figure 1.1. for the request format) and sends it through the SJA orthe official designated in paragraph 1.5.to HQ USAF/JAI or the appropriate AFLSA litigationdivision (see Chapter 2 through Chapter 7). NOTE: Officials in the Secretariat send requests through SAF/GC. 1.3.3.2.  Submits an affidavit or declaration (see Figure 1.2.) showing that the matter arose out ofthe performance of official Air Force duties. 1.3.3.3.  Submits an affidavit or declaration (see Figure 1.3.) from the requester’s commander orsupervisor stating that: 1.3.3.3.1.  He or she has read the complaint and the requester's affidavit or declaration. AFI51-301   20 JUNE 200291.3.3.3.2.  The matter arose out of the performance of official Air Force duties. 1.3.4.  Air Force personnel may request, from the nearest installation SJA, the assistance of Air Forcelegal counsel in preparing their request for representation. If such counsel is provided, an attorney-cli-ent relationship will exist between the Air Force counsel and the requesting Air Force employee untila decision on the representation request is reached, or the assistance is voluntarily terminated by oneor more of the parties involved. Communications and confidences shared between the Air Force coun-sel and the requesting Air Force employee for purposes of the provided legal assistance shall be priv-ileged. Air Force personnel who are required to have access to such privileged information for thepurpose of processing the request are also required to maintain the privilege. Given this privilege, andbecause of the SJA’s inherent duties to administer military justice and investigate claims or potentialclaims against the Air Force, SJAs should exercise caution in the assignment of personnel to processthese requests. Any subsequent representation of the employee by DoJ attorney or US Attorney per-sonnel shall also be considered to be covered by the attorney-client privilege. 1.3.5.  Requests for representation of Air Force personnel shall be forwarded to the appropriate civillaw division (JACL, JACN, JACE, or JACT) of the Air Force Legal Services Agency, or to HQUSAF/JAI, if foreign criminal or civil proceedings are involved. (Note: See Chapter 2 throughChapter 7 for more information on the litigation subject matter coverage of these various divisionsand offices.) Requests for representation of Air Force contractors should be forwarded to SAF/GCQ.Attorney-client privileged information should not be forwarded with the request unless absolutelynecessary to the processing of the request. In such instance, SJAs should only forward privilegedinformation with the written consent of the requester, and the prior approval and knowledge of thereceiving AFLSA civil litigation division, HQ USAF/JAI, or SAF/GCQ, as applicable. 1.3.6.  Provision of representation and continuation of the representation is within the sole discretionof the Attorney General or appropriate designee. Representation of Air Force personnel will be basedupon the following criteria: 1.3.6.1.  That the actions or omissions of the Air Force personnel being complained of occurredwithin the scope of employment; 1.3.6.2.  That the representation is in the interest of the United States; and 1.3.6.3.  That there is no unresolved conflict of interest between the United States and the AirForce personnel to be represented as to their relative legal positions. 1.3.7.  Representation of Air Force personnel by private counsel at federal expense, or with reimburse-ment of the private counsel fees, may be provided at the discretion of the Attorney General, and underthe same criteria as in paragraph 1.3.6. (The amount of reimbursement is determined through feeschedules set by the Civil Division of DoJ. For information on current fee schedules, please contactthe Director, Constitutional Torts Staff, Civil Division, at (202) 616-4140.) Such defense representa-tion may be provided under the following circumstances: 1.3.7.1.  In some rare federal criminal proceedings where it is in the interest of the United Statesand in accordance with the limitations of 28 CFR 50.16; 1.3.7.2.  In subject matter-related civil, congressional or state criminal proceedings where federalcriminal proceedings prohibit representation by DoJ or US Attorney personnel; 10AFI51-301   20 JUNE 20021.3.7.3.  In cases involving the representation of multiple Air Force personnel with conflicting orpotentially conflicting legal or factual positions that make representation by one attorney inappro-priate; 1.3.7.4.  In cases where the Solicitor General declines to authorize seeking further appellatereview by the United States; or 1.3.7.5.  In cases when DoJ personnel involved become aware that continued representation of theAir Force personnel could involve the assertion of a position that conflicts with the interests of theUnited States. 1.3.8.  The government will not be responsible for the expenses of individuals who hire private coun-sel without express prior authorization except in circumstances beyond the individual's control, suchas government dilatoriness or inaction, in which it then becomes necessary to hire private counsel inorder to protect the individual's interests. Ordinarily, the government will not be responsible for anyjudgments made against individuals in their personal capacities. 1.4.  Indemnification Requests.  1.4.1.  The Air Force usually cannot indemnify Air Force members or employees for any verdict,judgment, settlement, or other monetary award entered against them in their personal capacities. TheAir Force considers a request for indemnification if: 1.4.1.1.  The conduct giving rise to the verdict, judgment, settlement, or award was within themember's or employee's scope of employment; and 1.4.1.2.  It is in the interest of the United States to indemnify the individual. 1.4.2.  The Air Force member or employee seeking indemnification must submit a signed, writtenrequest to his or her servicing SJA and include: 1.4.2.1.  Copies of all documents proving liability. 1.4.2.2.  An explanation of how the conduct that created the liability was within the requester'sscope of employment or official duties. 1.4.2.3.  An explanation of how indemnification would be in the interest of the United States. 1.4.2.4.  A statement indicating if the requester has insurance or any other source of indemnifica-tion, and whether the requester has sought indemnification from such source. 1.4.2.5.  This declaration:     "I understand that the Air Force's acceptance of this request for indemnification for processingin accordance with AFI 51-301 does not constitute an acceptance of any obligation by the AirForce to make such indemnification. Any indemnification that the Air Force might make is a per-missive action taken solely in the interest of the United States and not for my personal benefit." 1.4.3.  Requesters must include with the request a recommendation by the servicing SJA specificallyaddressing each requirement of paragraph 1.4.2.Send the request and recommendation through SJAchannels with recommendations from each level to the chief of the appropriate litigation division.Comments from the SJA at major command (MAJCOM), field operating agency (FOA), or directreporting unit (DRU) are particularly important. AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002111.4.4.  Before forwarding a recommendation in favor of indemnification to the appropriate AFLSAcivil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, the MAJCOM, FOA, or DRU SJA coordinates the recom-mendation with that level FM. 1.4.4.1.  The chief of the responsible litigation division sends the request and recommendations,through channels, to the appropriate Secretarial designee for a decision. 1.4.4.2.  If there is insufficient time to submit an indemnification request through normal channels,submit the request directly to the Chief, General Litigation Division, who coordinates with theappropriate SJAs. 1.4.5.  The requester must include all documents or information necessary to process the indemnifica-tion request. 1.4.6.  The MAJCOM/FOA/DRU pays indemnification from their funds unless SAF/FM decides touse other funds. 1.4.7.  Indemnity decisions by the Secretarial designee are final and not subject to appeal of any kind. 1.5.  Other Authority.  1.5.1.

DoJ, through the local US Attorney or the Civil Division at DoJ, handles tort litigation involv-ing the US as a plaintiff or a defendant. 2.1.2.  The Tort Claims and Litigation Division (AFLSA/JACT) assists DoJ with Air Force casesinvolving the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The Environmental Law and Litigation Division(AFLSA/JACE) assists DoJ with environmental cases involving the FTCA. AFLSA/JACT or /JACEnormally retains litigation responsibility for all FTCA cases. However, AFLSA/JACT or /JACE maydelegate litigation responsibility of a particular case to a installation while retaining overall control oflitigation assistance. Delegations will be in writing from the chief of the division. 2.2.  Handling Complaints Received at Installation Level.  2.2.1.  When you receive a complaint under the FTCA, immediately telephone AFLSA/JACT or /JACE with: the names of all parties to the litigation; the court involved; the case's docket number; theamount of damages requested; the nature of the litigation; and complete information regarding serviceof process, pleading suspense dates, and any information about other government agencies involved. 2.2.2.

In all cases, except when litigation support isdelegated to the installation on a particular case, AFLSA/JACT or /JACE will respond to all discoveryrequests (interrogatories, document production, admissions) on behalf of the Air Force. However, theinstallation may be tasked to assist in responding to the discovery request. When tasked to assist duringdiscovery, promptly respond in accordance with the specific guidance received from AFLSA/JACT or /JACE. 2.4.  Handling Personal Negligence Complaints Against Air Force Employees at Installation Level-- Substitution.  2.4.1.  When a Complaint alleges common law negligence against an Air Force employee being suedin the employee’s personal capacity, substitution of the United States for the employee may be appro-priate under the FTCA. 24AFI51-301   20 JUNE 20022.4.1.1.  Where substitution may be the appropriate remedy, the employee makes a request for rep-resentation under paragraph 1.3.Claims personnel investigate incidents within their geographicarea of responsibility to ascertain the facts and circumstances. SJAs forward requests for represen-tation to AFLSA/JACT or /JACE with a recommendation as to whether or not the United Statesshould be substituted for the employee. The SJA’s forwarding documents must include the appli-cable state law on scope of employment, and an analysis of whether the employee was acting inthe scope of employment at the time of the incident giving rise to the lawsuit. 2.4.1.2.  The Air Force (i.e., AFLSAJACT or /JACE) forwards a recommendation to DoJ or theUS Attorney whether or not substitution is appropriate. 2.4.1.3.  The decision to seek substitution of the United States for the employee resides with DoJor the local US Attorney. Whether or not DoJ or the local US Attorney seeks substitution is basedstrictly upon whether or not the employee was acting in the scope of employment at the time of theincident. Scope of employment is determined by the applicable state law. AFI51-301   20 JUNE 200225Chapter 3  LITIGATION IN DOMESTIC COURTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCIES, OTHER THAN FEDERAL TORT CLAIMS ACT CASES, CONTRACTS, BANKRUPTCY, PATENT, COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND LAND USE CASES Section 3A—General Information 3.1.

The US Court of Federal Claims or federal district courts hear cases broughtby present or former civilian employees. These courts may permit trial de novo in Equal EmploymentOpportunity (EEO) cases. Most other civilian personnel cases involve appeals based wholly or in part onadministrative records. (See Figure 3.1. for checklist items for the preparation of an administrativerecord.) 3.3.1.  Civilian employees may appeal adverse decisions by the MSPB, and arbitrator decisions wherethe grievance involved a personnel action appealable to the MSPB, to the Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit. 3.3.2.  The types of administrative records and litigation support at the beginning of litigation mayvary widely. The litigation support requirements in paragraphs 3.3.3.through 3.3.5. are the minimumfor each type of case. AFLSA/JACL may require additional support in certain cases. 3.3.3.  EEO Cases. Although employees may usually get a trial de novo, administrative records fre-quently play a central role in these cases. Accordingly, SJAs should promptly obtain these records,including a transcript of the administrative hearing, from the custodian and submit five copies with alitigation report per paragraph 1.8. 3.3.4.  MSPB Appeals. These appeals are based solely upon facts developed during MSPB adminis-trative hearings or arbitrations. 3.3.4.1.

It is DoD policy to be neutral relative to annexation by a municipality or political subdivision in accordance with State law, unless the Secretary of the Military Department concerned determines that such action would not be in the best interest of the Federal Government, or it is opposed by another local jurisdiction.” 5.6.2.  The installation SJA sends a report analyzing the potential impact of a proposed annexationthat specifically addresses the impact of annexation on the right of the installation to contract for util-ity and waste disposal services to AFLSA/JACE and to AFLSA/JACL (ULT). If the right of theinstallation to contract for telephone services is impacted, a copy of the report should also be sent to38 EIW/JA, Tinker AFB, OK. [See paragraph 3.10.] Figure 5.1. outlines information that usuallyapplies to annexation proceedings. 5.7.  Rule-making Proceedings. Installation SJAs may submit comments on proposed state and localrules after approval by the Division Chief, AFLSA/JACE. SJAs shall submit proposed comments to theappropriate regional counsel office of AFLSA/JACE for obtaining such approval. 42AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002Figure 5.1.

The reporting authority submits an initial message, datafax or electronicmail to HQ USAF/JAI, with an information copy to the MAJCOM, immediately on receiving noticeof the start of a foreign suit, action, or proceeding that requires reporting. (See paragraph 6.2.) Ifdatafax or electronic mail is used, it is the responsibility of the sender to ensure its receipt. This initialreport precedes the formal litigation report (see paragraph 1.8.) and explains the subject of the action.Both reports should be identified as attorney work product. For the European theater, HQ USAFE/JAis responsible for advising DoJ’s European Office of all initiated suits. 6.3.2.  Confirming Letter.

Advise HQ USAF/JAI fully and promptly of all later developments. 6.5.2.  Send HQ USAF/JAI two copies of all pertinent correspondence and documents. 6.5.3.  Send information copies to the MAJCOM/JA and NAF/JA (see paragraph 6.3.) 6.6.  Commencement of Proceedings.  6.6.1.  Foreign Jurisdiction. The defense of sovereign immunity or a lack of jurisdiction of a foreigncourt may be proper only when the United States or one of its agencies or instrumentalities is a namedparty defendant, and in such event may be asserted only with the prior approval of DoJ and TJAG. 6.6.2.  Suits Against the United States. Send to the SJA any writ, summons, notice of legal proceed-ings, or other foreign civil process delivered to an Air Force officer, employee, or activity immedi-ately on receipt. 6.6.2.1.  The SJA then returns the document to the issuing authority, with a suitable statementrespectfully and tactfully explaining the lack of authority of the person or activity to accept serviceon behalf of the United States, and suggesting that service or delivery be made on the US Embassythrough established channels, or on the Department of Justice, Washington, DC, under the 1965Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil orCommercial Matters. Their address is Office of International Judicial Assistance, Civil Division,Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. SJAs should also forward courtesy copies of thesedocuments, including their written statement, to this DoJ office. 6.6.2.2.  No exceptions to this procedure exist except with prior approval from TJAG and DoJ, andclearance from the chief of the US diplomatic mission in the country. (See Figure 6.1. for a modelletter returning such a process). 6.6.2.3.  Refer questions concerning this policy to HQ USAF/JAI. 6.6.3.  Suits Against United States Government Agencies and Instrumentalities. 6.6.3.1.  United States Government agencies and instrumentalities in foreign countries, such asmilitary units and installations, installation exchanges, open messes, and military missions, lackjuridical personality under United States law. Such government activities of the United States gen-erally are not subject to civil proceedings or service of process in foreign countries. Claims nomi-nally against such activities are in law suits against the United States. 6.6.3.2.  Except for proceedings against US personnel arising outside of performance of officialduties, the United States is the only proper party defendant or respondent in any foreign civil pro-ceedings. 6.6.3.3.  The US embassy in that country is the only United States activity that may receive andaccept service of foreign process. 6.6.3.4.  In suits against United States Government agencies and instrumentalities, the SJA returnsthe foreign process to the issuing authority with a suitable statement respectfully and tactfullyexplaining the lack of juridical personality on the part of the United States Government agency orinstrumentality involved. (See Figure 6.1. for model letter returning process). 6.6.4.  Suits Against Individuals Acting in an Official Capacity. 46AFI51-301   20 JUNE 20026.6.4.1.  These guidelines apply to civil suits, actions, and proceedings in foreign countries againstindividual members or employees of the Air Force for acts or omissions arising out of the perfor-mance of their official duties. 6.6.4.2.  The guidelines on returning process to issuing authorities do not apply if TJAG decidesthat applying them is inconsistent with pertinent provisions of a status of forces or similar agree-ment, or that applying them may adversely affect the defense of such suits in that country. 6.6.4.3.  When a process on its face establishes that the act or omission complained of is patentlya governmental act: 6.6.4.3.1.  Return it to the issuing authorities with a letter signed by the SJA explaining that theact or omission complained of was performed by the subject while acting as an official of theAir Force or an agency of the United States Government, and in the performance of officialduties under superior orders. 6.6.4.3.2.  Further state that in legal effect the subject is not the proper party defendant. Theletter should not contain any express statement that suit should be brought against the UnitedStates, as this is an improper invitation of suits against the United States. 6.6.4.4.  When a process does not on its face establish that the act was governmental: 6.6.4.4.1.  Return it with a similar letter of explanation to that described above. 6.6.4.4.2.  Attach a certified statement from the member’s immediate commander attesting tothe employment or military status of the individual and indicating that the individual was per-forming official duties at the time and place when the alleged act occurred. 6.6.4.4.3.  If the issuing authority rejects the return of process: 6.6.4.4.3.1.  Allow the service of the process according to applicable international agree-ment and local law and procedures. 6.6.4.4.3.1.1.  If proper service is obtained, the defendant must defend the suit, and thedefendant must prove during the trial that the occurrence was part of his or her officialduties. 6.6.5.  Garnishment and Attachment Proceedings. As a general rule, the United States and its agenciesand instrumentalities are not subject to garnishment orders or money attachment proceedings in for-eign countries aimed at wages or other funds due and payable by the United States to alleged or adju-dicated debtors of the parties on whose behalf garnishment or attachment is attempted. 6.6.5.1.  An exception to this rule exists in the Federal Republic of Germany. Under Article 34(3),German Supplementary Agreement to the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, the United Statesmust (see Public Law 93-647, Social Services Amendments of 1974, January 4, 1975) honor writsof garnishment issued by German courts against members of US forces or civilian component sta-tioned in the Federal Republic of Germany for child support or alimony obligations. Consult theDoD Military Pay and Allowances Entitlements Manual, paragraph 70710. 6.6.5.2.  In all other cases, the United States cannot honor garnishment orders or money attach-ments. You may cooperate with the foreign judicial and administrative authorities and advise ofthe date, time, and place of payment to the debtor. The creditor can exercise legal rights directlyagainst the debtor without submitting the United States or its activities to the jurisdiction of theAFI51-301   20 JUNE 200247foreign court or agency. Upon receipt of any writ, order, or petition for garnishment or moneyattachment served on, or otherwise delivered to an Air Force officer, employee, or activity, refersuch document to the SJA. 6.6.5.3.  If the United States cannot honor the garnishment or money attachment request, per para-graph 6.6.5.2., the SJA returns it to the issuing authority. 6.6.5.3.1.  The SJA advises the foreign court or other agency that the US military authoritieswill cooperate with the local authorities to allow the creditor to pursue remedies under locallaw directly against the debtor. (See Figure 6.1. for a model letter.) 6.6.5.3.2.  If the debtor is a United States citizen or resident alien, release only informationauthorized under the Privacy Act (see AFI 33-332, Air Force Privacy Act Program). 6.6.5.3.3.  Send full electronic report of each case immediately to the NAF/JA, MAJCOM/JA,and HQ USAF/JAI. 6.6.5.4.  If the United States can honor the garnishment or money attachment request, per para-graph 6.6.5.1., the MAJCOM SJA will implement procedures for processing such requests. Senda full report of each case immediately to the NAF/JA, MAJCOM/JA, and HQ USAF/JAI. 6.7.  Defending Against Foreign Suits and Proceedings.  6.7.1.  DoJ prosecutes and defends in all foreign courts all civil suits by or against the United States,US agencies, US instrumentalities, or officials and employees whose official conduct is involved. Theinformation contained in reports made under this chapter constitutes the basis for a report by HQUSAF to DoJ and for an Air Force recommendation to that Department as to the action to be taken inthe case. DoJ, in turn, takes action to ensure that steps are taken to institute or defend the suit. 6.7.2.  United States Government Representation of an Individual. DoJ represents military personneland civilian employees of the Air Force being sued in foreign courts because of actions they took inthe line of duty in the performance of their official duties. 6.7.2.1.  DoJ decides for each case if it will provide representation or permit the Air Force to do so. 6.7.2.2.  Submit requests for United States Government representation in foreign courts (see para-graph 1.3.) in writing through HQ USAF/JAI. 6.7.2.3.  The United States Government does not pay for private counsel that individuals hire with-out specific authorization and will not pay any judgment against the individual (see paragraphs1.3.and 1.4.). 6.7.3.  United States Government Representation of an Air Force Contractor. If an Air Force contrac-tor requests United States Government representation before a foreign civil court, contact HQ USAF/JAI for guidance and follow the procedures in paragraph 1.3. 6.7.4.  Obtaining a Continuance. If the date set for a hearing does not allow enough time to retainUnited States Government counsel, the SJA, in consultation with DoJ, may be instructed to attempt toget a continuance. 6.7.4.1.  In attempting to obtain such continuance, the SJA does not appear in court or do anythingelse that can be construed as a defense or a legal appearance. 6.7.4.2.  Advise HQ USAF/JAI electronically of all such attempts. 48AFI51-301   20 JUNE 20026.7.5.  Cooperating with Foreign Counsel. SJAs will give information and evidence to foreign counselthat DoJ retains to represent US interests. 6.7.6.  Communicating with DoJ. DoJ retains, instructs, and pays foreign counsel. 6.7.6.1.  The retained counsel keeps in touch with DoJ. 6.7.6.2.  SJAs are encouraged, as the need arises, to communicate directly with DoJ and, wherenecessary, their retained counsel. Back brief NAF/JA and MAJCOM/JA, as appropriate. 6.7.7.  Handling Administrative Legal Problems in Civil Litigation. Do not consult with foreign coun-sel retained by DoJ on administrative legal problems collateral to the civil litigation. When the localSJA cannot resolve such problems, refer them to the next higher command. 6.8.  Suing in a Foreign Court. 6.8.1.  The United States may: 6.8.1.1.  Sue for money damages. 6.8.1.2.

DoJ prosecutes civil suits for the United States. The DoJ will: 6.8.2.1.  Quickly identify the basis for any legal action. 6.8.2.2.  Notify HQ USAF/JAI promptly. 6.8.3.  If a contractor is facing criminal proceedings based on an activity or transaction for which theUnited States may sue in civil court, the SJA shall notify HQ USAF/JAI immediately. When suchaction serves the interest of the United States, DoJ can intervene as a complainant in the criminal case. 6.8.4.  After you identify a wrong and deem action proper, the SJA shall alert DoJ immediately bymessage to HQ USAF/JAI. Include: 6.8.4.1.  A description of the facts of the case. 6.8.4.2.  A discussion of the local law that applies to the dispute. 6.8.4.3.  An analysis of why a suit is appropriate. 6.8.4.4.  Date at which the applicable statute of limitations will run. 6.8.4.5.

Release Authorities for Official Information. The following personnel are the release authoritiesfor official Air Force information in the following litigation situations: 9.3.1.  SJAs are the release authorities for official, unclassified factual information in private litigationcases. In lieu of an available SJA, Secretariat personnel should consult with SAF/GC. 9.3.2.  Likewise, Medical Law Consultants (MLCs) are the release authorities for official, unclassifiedfactual information in private litigation, to the extent it involves the release of medical and otherrecords and information within the custody, control or knowledge of their permanent station hospitaland its personnel. 9.3.3.  For official information to be used in litigation before the Armed Services Board of ContractAppeals, contracting officers, in consultation with the appropriate servicing SJA, are authorized torelease such information per the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), subpart 5.4., and applicableDoD directives and Air Force instructions. Responses to such requests must be coordinated with theassigned trial attorney at the AFMC LO/JAB, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5000. 9.3.4.  The responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI (for official information tobe released to, or used in, foreign courts) releases all official, unclassified Air Force information incases in which the United States is a party or has a direct or indirect interest; they also make all suchrelease decisions for cases in which the information could be used in a claim or litigation against theUnited States. 9.4.  Applicability to Former and Retired Air Force Personnel. Former and retired Air Force person-nel who have possession of or access to official Air Force information, including classified information,are also required to follow the procedures in this section to obtain permission from the Air Force torelease such information. 9.5.  Factors in Releasing Official Information or Testimony. Release authorities ensure requestersstate in writing the nature and relevance of the official information they want and include as much detailas possible. The appropriate release authority then uses this information to evaluate the request in light ofDoDD 5405.2 (32 C.F.R., Part 97) and United States, ex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). Beforereleasing official information, release authorities consider these questions: 9.5.1.  Is the demand or request unduly burdensome or otherwise irrelevant? 9.5.2.  Does the demand or request specify remedial information that is inadmissible under the rules ofevidence, or is the information otherwise inappropriate under the applicable court rules? 9.5.3.  Would disclosing this information (including release in camera) be appropriate under the rulesof procedure governing the case and under the relevant substantive law concerning the appropriateprivilege? 9.5.4.  Would disclosing the information violate any statute, executive order, regulation, or directive?Release documents subject to the Privacy Act only with consent of the individual or under a courtorder or subpoena specifically signed by a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. Because anorder against the United States is an order against the sovereign, what is considered to be a court ofcompetent jurisdiction under the Privacy Act is subject to interpretation. [See 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11);Doe v. DiGenova, 779 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir 1985); Bosaw v. NTEU, 887 F. Supp. 1199 (S.D. Ind. 1995);60AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002and Boron Oil Co. v. Downie, 873 F. 2d 67 (4th Cir. 1989).] Please refer any questions to the appropri-ate civil litigation division. 9.5.5.  Would disclosing the information, except in camera to assert a claim of privilege, reveal classi-fied or other restricted information? Particularly, would it reveal: 9.5.5.1.  Data under DoD 5200-1-R, Information Security Program, January 1997 or AFI 31-401,Information Security Program Management? 9.5.5.2.  Unclassified technical data withheld from public release pursuant to DoD Directive5230.25, Withholding of Unclassified Technical Data From Public Disclosure, November 6, 1984(including Change 1, August 18, 1995)? 9.5.5.3.  Privileged safety information or documents contained in safety investigation board (SIB)reports conducted under AFI 91-204, Safety Investigations And Reports, and restricted from pub-lic release by DoD Instruction 6055.7, Accident Investigation, Reporting and Recordkeeping,October 3, 2000? 9.5.5.4.  Other matters exempt from unrestricted disclosure? 9.5.6.  Would disclosure interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings, compromise constitutionalrights, reveal the identity of an intelligence source or confidential informant, disclose trade secrets orsimilarly confidential commercial or financial information, or otherwise be inappropriate under thecircumstances? 9.6.  Classified Information. No one, including release authorities, shall release classified official infor-mation to courts or unauthorized persons under any circumstances, unless proper authority first declassi-fies the material. 9.6.1.  When requesters ask for classified information that classification authorities cannot declassifyat lower levels, Air Force personnel, through their SJAs, shall notify the appropriate civil litigationdivision of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI (if a foreign court is involved). 9.6.2.  Pending a final decision, the servicing SJA (or SAF/GC) shall ensure the requester, court, orother authority is furnished with a copy of Title 32, C.F.R., Part 97 (DoD Directive 5405.2) and thischapter and shall inform the requester that the request is under review. If necessary, SJAs will work toobtain a stay of the request or demand pending a final determination. 9.7.  Defending Denials. For decisions denying official information within the authority of SJAs, SJAsare authorized to consult directly with local United States attorneys or DoJ litigation attorneys to defendsuch decisions from subpoenas, court orders, or other legal challenges before local, state or federal courts,administrative bodies or other tribunals. Before any such consultation, however, SJAs are first required tonotify the appropriate civil litigation division of AFLSA or HQ USAF/JAI of the need to consult, provid-ing a brief factual background of the case and giving the reasons for such consultation. 9.8.  Releasing Official Information to DoJ. DoJ and its US Attorneys represent the government's inter-est in judicial proceedings involving the Air Force. 9.8.1.  SJAs may release unclassified official information that is not privileged to DoJ or the US Attor-ney on request. AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002619.8.2.  SJAs must send DOJ or US Attorney requests for classified information that cannot be declas-sified at lower levels, or for other privileged official information, to the responsible AFLSA civil liti-gation division or HQ USAF/JAI for a decision. 9.9.  Fees. Persons releasing copies of records and other documentary material collect fees from therequester according to the fee schedule in Chapter 6 of DoD 5400.7-R/AF Supplement, DOD Freedom ofInformation Act Program, or 32 C.F.R. 97. 6(d). 9.10.  Sending Requests. When an SJA requests a decision on releasing official information from anAFLSA civil litigation division or HQ USAF/JAI, he or she should provide the following information: 9.10.1.  Name of litigation and parties. 9.10.2.  Name and location of the court or tribunal. 9.10.3.  Date the litigation began and date of requested appearance. 9.10.4.  Name and address of requester and of party who has the requested official information. 9.10.5.  Type of action, subject matter, and a statement of the relevancy of the requested information. 9.10.6.  Copies of documents requested, or a complete description of them if they are bulky or numer-ous. 9.10.7.  Recommendations on release and any other pertinent information. 9.11.  Complying With Subpoenas.  9.11.1.  SJAs give legal advice to Air Force personnel under subpoena to appear and testify concern-ing official information. 9.11.1.1.  When the proper release authority prohibits releasing the subpoenaed information, andthe information does not include Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) material, the person receiving thesubpoena, with the assistance of the appropriate legal office, attempts to resolve the matter withthe attorney requesting the information or issuing the subpoena, or appears and explains the matterto the court. When Privacy Act material is involved, the SJA's office should assist the subpoenaedperson to: 9.11.1.1.1.  Determine if a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction personally issued the sub-poena; and 9.11.1.1.2.  Make or negotiate an adequate response, or appear before the court, as appropriate. 9.11.1.1.3.  Where another release authority has been involved, SJAs should also consult withthat authority, as necessary or appropriate. 9.11.1.2.  If the court or requesting attorney is not satisfied and persists in requesting the informa-tion, the witness respectfully asks for time to send the request to the appropriate AFLSA civil liti-gation division or HQ USAF/JAI for a final Air Force decision and possible assistance from DoJ. 9.11.1.3.  Judge advocates may accompany and advise the witness concerning a problem onrelease of official information. 62AFI51-301   20 JUNE 20029.11.2.  When a subpoena calls for classified or otherwise unreleasable information outside of theirrelease authority, SJAs, after the approval of the appropriate AFLSA civil litigation division or HQUSAF/JAI, may: 9.11.2.1.  Communicate with the counsel requesting the subpoena. 9.11.2.2.  Explain the restrictions on release. 9.11.2.3.  Give the attorney releasable information. 9.11.2.4.  Suggest withdrawing the subpoena. 9.11.3.  Promptly report any subpoenas from foreign courts requiring records, files, or documents toHQ USAF/JAI. 9.12.  Authenticating Documents. Authenticate official Air Force documents for civil litigation, ratherthan requiring the custodian to personally appear and testify. The authentication procedure in Chapter 8meets the requirements of federal courts and of most state courts and administrative bodies. Use the sim-plest authentication procedure permissible.

Before the witness testifies, the SJA advises HQ USAF/JAI or the appropriate AFLSAcivil litigation division. 9.18.5.2.  When the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeal requests or subpoenas Air Forcepersonnel to testify, report it to the AFMC LO/JAB, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-5000. AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002659.18.5.3.

Submit approval requests through command channels. Detail the proposed testimony. HQUSAF/JAG normally approves this type of request only: 9.19.1.1.  To serve a significant Air Force interest. 9.19.1.2.  When no conflict of interest exists. 9.19.2.  Unless serving an Air Force or DoD objective, the witness and the legislative body will paythe expenses. 9.20.  Expert or Opinion Testimony of Air Force Personnel.  9.20.1.  Air Force personnel do not provide opinion or expert testimony concerning official Air Forceor DoD information, subjects, or activities, except on behalf of the United States or for a party thatDoJ represents. 9.20.1.1.  Under unique circumstances and when testimony will not adversely affect the interestsof the Air Force or the United States, special authorization for Air Force personnel to appear andtestify as an expert witness in private litigation at no expense to the United States may be granted.Requests for such special authorization must be coordinated, via the appropriate organization SJA,with the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division (including JACC for hospital recoveryactions) or, in foreign jurisdiction cases, HQ USAF/JAI. The responsible AFLSA civil litigationdivision or HQ USAF/JAI or may deny the request, or forward it with a recommendation forapproval, through AFLSA/JACL, to AFLSA/JAC. AFLSA/JAC is the approval authority forrequests for special authorization to provide expert or opinion testimony. 9.20.1.2.  If, despite a negative final determination by AFLSA/JAC, judicial or other appropriategovernmental authorities order Air Force personnel to appear and testify, notify AFLSA/JAC. 9.20.1.2.1.

The Air Force may direct Air Force personnel not to testify, in which case affectedAir Force personnel must respectfully decline to comply with the demand. See United Statesex rel. Touhy v. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1951). 9.20.1.3.  The Air Force must maintain strict impartiality in private litigation. If Air Force person-nel provide expert or opinion testimony in private litigation, such testimony frequently requiresdiscussing their current position and duty experience. This can easily create the impression that66AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002the Air Force favors a particular finding, even though it has no official interest in the outcome ofthe litigation. Furthermore, the efforts of the litigants to obtain such testimony may interfere withthe normal functions of Air Force personnel. 9.20.2.  Civilian counsel who want Air Force personnel to give expert or opinion testimony submitrequests to the servicing SJA. 9.20.2.1.  The SJA reviews the request and sends it with a recommendation for approval or disap-proval to the responsible AFLSA civil litigation division or, in foreign jurisdiction cases, HQUSAF/JAI. For hospital recovery actions, coordinate the request with AFLSA/JACC. The respon-sible AFLSA civil litigation division, AFLSA/JACC, or HQ USAF/JAI may deny the request, orforward it with a recommendation for approval, through AFLSA/JACL, to AFLSA/JAC. AFLSA/JAC is the approval authority for these requests. 9.20.2.2.  The request should include: 9.20.2.2.1.  Name of litigation and parties. 9.20.2.2.2.  Name and location of the court or tribunal. 9.20.2.2.3.  Date the litigation began and date of the requested appearance. 9.20.2.2.4.  Party for whom the request is made. 9.20.2.2.5.  Name, grade, position, and organization of the witness. 9.20.2.2.6.  Type of action, subject matter, and nature of testimony. 9.20.2.2.7.  Detailed statement showing why the Air Force should grant an exception. 9.20.3.  Air Force personnel in a nonofficial capacity may not provide expert review of evidence inprivate litigation where one of the parties in the litigation may request expert or opinion testimonyfrom Air Force personnel. 9.20.3.1.  SJAs will keep Air Force personnel aware of this provision. 9.20.3.2.  After receiving approval of AFLSA/JAC to testify as an expert, Air Force personnelmay then engage in such expert review. 9.20.4.  The Air Force does not usually consider course of treatment testimony by a treating physicianto be expert or opinion testimony. A treating physician may testify as to his or her examination, treat-ment, and prognosis for a patient. However, if the scope or direction of the physician’s testimony isexpected or likely to go beyond these areas into others involving the physician’s professional opinionor specialized knowledge, the physician must be treated as providing expert or opinion testimony thatwould require permission per the requirements of paragraph 9.20.1. and 9.20.2. 9.21.  Expert or Opinion Testimony by Former Air Force Personnel. Former Air Force personnelmay not provide expert or opinion testimony about any matter in which they had a direct involvementwhile employed by the government or serving on active duty, unless they first obtain special authorizationvia the procedures outlined in paragraph 9.20. 9.22.  Travel of Witnesses to Overseas Areas. Report requests for travel of witnesses to overseas areasto testify in foreign criminal cases to HQ USAF/JAI. 9.22.1.  The Air Force does not usually fund such travel. AFI51-301   20 JUNE 2002679.22.2.  The requester must prove that the trip serves official purposes. 9.22.3.  The requesting command usually funds necessary official travel of witnesses in foreign crim-inal courts. 9.23.  Travel Expenses for Witnesses.  9.23.1.  28 U.S.C. 1821 and the JFTR/JTR govern travel allowances for Air Force personnel appear-ing as witnesses in litigation. 9.23.2.  JFTR paragraphs U7060 and U7061 apply to military personnel, and JTR paragraph C4502applies to Air Force civilian personnel employed by appropriated fund activities. 9.23.3.  The Air Force pays travel expenses for Air Force personnel assigned to Air Force activitieswho are appearing as witnesses for the United States. The unit issuing orders funds travel. 9.23.4.  Air Force personnel appearing as necessary witnesses for a party asserting the government’sclaim for medical care expenses are witnesses for the United States if the government’s claim is largeenough to justify the expenditure, as determined by the responsible SJA. 9.23.5.  When Air Force personnel appear as witnesses for the United States, but the Air Force is notinvolved in the litigation, AFLSA/JACL, or JACT (in cases arising under AFI 51-501), instructs theunit issuing the orders on how to obtain travel reimbursement. 9.23.6.
