Methods of Submitting Flight Data. There are two methods of submitting flight data into thenational air traffic system:  by automated teleprocessing and by voice.  The primary method of processingthis data is through the automated Service B telecommunications system.  Service B is part of theNational Airspace Data Interchange Network (NADIN).  This network provides DoD base operationswith the capability to send and receive flight plans and related air traffic messages between worldwide USmilitary base operations, Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCC), and FAA Flight Service Stations(FSS).  At base operations where voice procedures are used, flight data is submitted by interphone directto the FAA FSS.  Voice procedures are specified in attachment 3.  The lead DoD agency for this programis Headquarters Air Force Flight Standards Agency (HQ AFFSA/XVA).1.1.1. Equipment Provided. Continental United States (CONUS) military base operations areequipped with state-of-the-art equipment for sending and receiving air traffic messages.  This equip-ment is leased by the FAA and provided for DoD use.  Procedures on equipment usage are found inpublications issued to and available at base operations.  If equipment must be moved, the circum-stances describing the move must be provided, in writing, to the DoD Service B Program Manager(HQ AFFSA/XVA) 90 calendar days before requested move date.  1.1.2. System Circuitry. Military base operations are provided with a dedicated circuit (or dialaccess) through which all messages are transmitted.  Message traffic is automatically processedthrough the FAA switching centers and distributed according to address coding. Therefore, messagesmust be prepared according to the instructions provided in this publication.  Incorrectly prepared mes-sages will be rejected and the originator subsequently notified.  1.1.3. NADIN Switch. Two NADIN switching centers, one in Atlanta GA and one in Salt Lake CityUT, monitor and control the Service B system.  DoD bases east of the Mississippi River and in theMinneapolis ARTCC area are connected to NADIN Atlanta.  Bases west of the Mississippi, exceptthose in Minneapolis ARTCC are connected to NADIN Salt Lake City.  These switching centers havethe capability to selectively monitor any message and will reject unauthorized messages.  DoD facili-ties will use this communications system and equipment for authorized air traffic messages only.Examples of nonacceptable materials are:  • Classified messages or material.• Unnecessary or anonymous signals or correspondence.  •Personal messages.  Its use for unauthorized messages may be grounds for disciplinary action.Since each base is on a dedicated circuit, circuit control will immediately know the originatorof the  transmission.  1.1.4. Equipment/Circuit Problems and Rerouting Traffic. When an equipment outage occurs oris anticipated, the involved facility will immediately notify its ARTCC who in turn will notify theappropriate NADIN switch (Atlanta NADIN 404-946-7675 or Salt Lake City NADIN 801-539-3172)of the situation.  If base operations personnel are unable to transmit data, they will ask an adjacentfacility to make the notification.  NADIN will initiate action to reroute traffic to the tie-in FSS.  Baseoperations personnel will also notify the local ARTCC and contractor repair facility.  The appropriate800 telephone number is 1-800-336-1551 when communicating with the repair facility.  Base opera-AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 19945tions personnel will report outages in excess of 24 hours to the Service B Program Manager, DSN858-4779, HQ AFFSA/XVA, 1535 Command Dr, Suite D309, Andrews AFB MD 20331-7002.1.2. Message Format (General). There are several different formats used for transmitting air trafficcontrol and movement messages.  Although each type of message is explained in detail, certain entries arecommon to each message (figure 1.1).Figure 1.1. Common Message Address Format./BSystem AuthorizationFF                                                              ADWPrecedence Indicator                     Addressee(s) (3- or 8-letter Ident)(Control D*)              011500                    KBLVYXYX Date Time Group (6 numbers)             Originator (8-letter ICAO)(Control B*)  IFR WAXY74 C29 BLV ADW 1635                                      Message Text* Hold down the control key and the D or B key as required for this entry.  The control D and Bcharacters will print on the CRT screen, but will not print on the base operations printer.NOTE:  Self-addressing is not authorized as this action doubles the amount of data being processed• Each message will be preceded by the function "/B."• Each message will include a precedence identifier from the following list: Identifier SSDDFFGGMessage TypeMessages involving safety of life and property.  Re-stricted to emergency information.  Priority operational and circuit control messages.Flight  movement, including  modification  andchange messages directly relating to the safe and ef-ficient operation of the aircraft.Flight cancellation, delay messages, and all others.  NOTE:  Routinely, base operations personnel will use precedence identifier "FF."  Message acknowledg-ments must be the same precedence as the message being received.  Each message will also contain:  • One  or  more  addressees,  using  a  three-letter  identifier  (Ident)  for  CONUS  facilities  or  aneight-letter  Ident  for  international  agencies.    Do  not  exceed  seven  addressees  on  the  messageaddress line.  (69 characters including separating spaces.)  • Date and time group (281630) in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  UTC is the mean solartime  at  the  meridian  of  Greenwich,  England,  used  as  a  basis  for  standard  time  throughout  theworld.  Normally expressed in four numerals 0001 through 2400. Also called Greenwich MeanTime, GMT, Greenwich civil time, universal time, Z-time, or Zulu Time.6AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994• Originators eight-letter ICAO identifier (KHTBYXYX).  • The fifth through the eighth letters of an international ICAO identifier specify the agency or officereceiving or sending a message.

Base Operations Responsibility. Immediately after a departure, base operations personnel will sub-mit a flight notification departure message to the next point of landing (figure 2.1).  If this facility is not afull Service B location, submit the message to the destination tie-in FAA FSS.  Initial departure messageswill contain, as a minimum:  • Type of flight plan• Aircraft identification• Type aircraft  • Departure point  • Destination• ETA• Remarks; e.g., coded data pertinent to services, passengers, or cargo.  In the absence of remarks,enter the letter "N" (meaning none) in the remarks field.  When an FSS is an addressee precederemarks with a dollar sign ($).  NOTES:1.  The remarks section will include items applicable to that segment of flight.  Enter "AERO CLUB" for those aircraft assigned to a base AERO CLUB.  EXAMPLE: VFR N214MC C172 BLV BYH 1630 S BLV AERO CLUB.  2.  For civil aircraft enter users name and landing permit number, which should be indicated on the DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, or FAA 7233-1, Flight Plan. (Obtain FAA Form 7233-1 from any FAA Flight Service Center.)  Remember the pilot is required to enter this information as stated in his or her landing permit authorization letter.  EXAMPLE:  WOODALL HAF 900001C.  3.  Destination station base operations will check the monthly Civil Aircraft Landing Permit Report to verify permit currency.  User name will be listed by individuals last name or company first name, such as Admire, Mark A = Admire and Crown Central Petroleum Corp = Crown.  Figure 2.1.

VFR Stopover Departure (Flight Notification) Messages.  Address messages to all baseoperations or FSSs having tie-in responsibility for the different points of intended landing.  Separatestopover legs by a slant (/) at the end of each leg except the last.  Before the slant, include remarks and,if the message is addressed to DoD base operations only, include the proposed departure time applica-ble to each leg.  Place remarks that apply to the entire route at the end of the message.  Begin eachstopover leg as a new line.  The first leg will show ETA to the first stop.  The additional legs will showestimated time en route (ETE) between legs.  Enter a void time as a last line item.  NOTE: Although shown in the following example, an FAA FSS is not required to include a proposed departure time from stopover points in Departure Notification Messages: EXAMPLE:/BFF SKF BSM HLR 071400 KNGPYXYX VFR R23467 UH1 NGP SKF 1532 P1600/ BSM 0+30 P1730/ HLR 1+50 This message, transmitted by Corpus Christi Naval Air Station base operations, indicates stopovers at Kelly  and Bergstrom AFBs with the destination being Fort Hood.  To calculate the void time, take the total time from takeoff to final destination, rounded to the next whole hour.  2.2.3. VFR Departure (Flight Notification) Message from  Stopover Point. En route stations areresponsible for sending departure notices when an aircraft departs their location.  EXAMPLEAFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 19949/B FF BSM 071600 KSKFYXYX R23467 D1605   This message sent by Kelly AFB to Bergstrom AFB indicates the aircraft departed at 1605.  2.2.4. VFR Arrival and Cancellation Messages. When an aircraft arrives at its destination and anarrival or cancellation message has been requested, follow the following example:EXAMPLE:/BFF RND072020 KHLRYXYX R23467 RND A2015 HLRThis message sent by Ft Hood Army Airfield to Randolph AFB indicates an arrival at 2015.2.3. Sample Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Departure (Flight Notification) Messages: 2.3.1. IFR One Way. The same elements used in a VFR departure notice will be used in an IFRdeparture notice, except the type of flight will be shown as IFR.EXAMPLE:IFR One Way (C-9 Air Evacuation (EVAC) Andrews AFB to Plattsburgh AFB):/BFF PBG281421 KADWYXYX  IFR E116 C9 ADW PBG 1430Spoken, this departure message would read:  "IFR, EVAC one one six,  C9, Andrews to Plattsburgh, ETA 1430."  2.3.2.

The message also indicates that service is required at Loring AFB and Boston International (Intl), and a USAF code 5 M/Gen (A5) who requests no assistance (O) will be on loaded at Andrews AFB and offloaded at Scott AFB.  See chapter 4 of DoD FLIP (General Planning) for VIP codes.  Proposed times from each stop may be included if the message is between DoD base operations.NOTE:  AP is used at onload station to depict passenger pickup.  DP indicates passenger deplaning sta-tion. 2.3.3. Departure From Stopover Point. When the aircraft  departs from a stopover point, base oper-ations personnel at the stopover location will send a departure notice to the next destination.EXAMPLE:/BFF LIZ  281615 KPBGYXYXTUG11 D16052.4.

It is not practical to provide examples of every possible departure notice.It is important however, to use the format specified above.  If the departure message becomes involved,such as in the case of tactical missions that originate as formation flights and return as single ship, do nothesitate to use clear text to explain the mission more completely.  AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 199411Chapter 3 DOMESTIC IFR FLIGHT PLANS HANDLING3.1. IFR Flight Plan Proposals (CONUS). Base operations personnel will submit all IFR flight planproposals to the ARTCC computer within whose control area the IFR flight originates (figure 3.1).  Seeattachment 2 for specific IFR message text requirements.  Messages will be addressed to CONUSARTCC (three-letter) facility identifier;  i.e., ZDC.3.1.1. One-Way Flight Plan.

Short Notice IFR Flight Plan Messages. If the IFR flight plan indicates a time en route of 30minutes or less to the first stop, identify the destination as an addressee on the IFR proposal message.EXAMPLE:/B FF ZME NMM191607 KNQAYXYXNQA1607010 FP SKULL04 A4/P 370 NQA P1630 190\ NQA..MEM..IGB..MEI..NMM/00303.2. Altitude Reservations (ALTRV):3.2.1. CONUS. Flight plans that include ALTRV information in CONUS airspace are processed tothe FAA ARTCC by the Central Altitude Reservation Facility.  Base operations should not resubmitto the CONUS ARTCC that portion of the flight plan, DD Form 175, Military Flight Plan, that con-tains an ALTRV being flown in US airspace. 3.2.1.1. If the ALTRV starts at the originating base, that is the aircraft is on an ALTRV immedi-ately after departure, base operations personnel do not submit an IFR flight plan proposal mes-sage.  The ARTCC performs all actions. 3.2.1.2. If the ALTRV is initiated or begins en route, use the following procedure: 3.2.1.2.1. The originating base operations submits a flight data message specifying the fixwhere the ALTRV begins, followed by the amount of time required to fly from the ALTRVentry point to the ALTRV exit point, followed by the exit point and remainder of route.EXAMPLE:  flight plan route to (entry point) ABC 136050/D02+00..XYZ (exit point) andflight plan route to destination.  This base operations message is similar to the message used toshow a delay en route at altitude.  The ALTRV duration, or delay time, is determined from theALTRV approval message. 3.2.1.2.2. Local procedures should ensure base operations personnel understand the ALTRVentry point, ALTRV delay time and exit point.  The remarks section of the flight data messageshould specify the point where the ALTRV is joined and the ALTRV name.  EXAMPLE:JOIN DING BAT1 ALTRV at ABC 136050.   3.2.2. International Flight Plans. The ALTRV must be included in the International flight plan DDForm 1801, International Flight Plan,  when the entire ALTRV takes place outside CONUS air-space.   Base operations personnel will ensure that the ALTRV is included in the IFR flight data mes-sage (FPL) sent to the CONUS ARTCC computer.  If the ALTRV begins in CONUS airspace andextends into another country’s airspace, base operations personnel will have to transmit two flight planmessages.  The first flight plan message will be submitted in domestic format using the proceduresabove and sent to the CONUS ARTCC computer.  The flight plan will also be sent to all addresseesexcept the ARTCC computer.3.2.3. Summary:16AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 19943.2.3.1. If the ALTRV is all in CONUS airspace, do not include ALTRV as part of the flight planmessage.  Include the ALTRV entry and exit points and ALTRV duration in the text of the IFRflight plan message.  Identify the ALTRV in remarks.3.2.3.2. If the ALTRV is all in international airspace, include the entire ALTRV in the route offlight.  Identify the ALTRV in remarks.   3.2.3.3. If the ALTRV begins in CONUS airspace and continues into international airspace, twomessages are required:   ••Send one IFR flight plan proposal message (domestic format) as in 3.2.3.1. above.   Send the second message in International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) format toall addressees.   NOTE:The local ARTCC may have requirements that amend the above directions.  Base operations personnelmust work closely with the ARTCC to ensure a mutual understanding of ALTRV procedures exists.   3.3. Canceling or Amending Messages. Flight plans previously submitted to the CONUS ARTCCcomputer may be amended by an amendment message (AM) or canceled by using a remove strip (RS)message until 30 minutes before the proposed departure time.  After 30 minutes before the proposeddeparture time, base operations personnel must call the ARTCC for manual coordination.3.3.1. AM Message. The AM message (figure 3.2) is used to modify, add to, or delete previouslyfiled flight plan data.  When accepted, the amendment information becomes a part of the flight plandata base.  An AM is user-generated and is different than a correction message (CM) which is sent torespond to an error message generated by the ARTCC computer.  If Field 02 (aircraft identification) isto be amended, no other field may be amended in the same AM.  If Field 02 and other fields are to beamended, send a RS message (figure 3.3) and reenter a corrected flight plan.EXAMPLE: /BFF ZHU 121900 KRNDYXYX  RND1827055 AM HUNT12 02 HUNT33In this message, the change applies to  "field two", aircraft identification.

Error and CMs. Errors in IFR flight plan proposal messages are identified by the FAA computerand a rejection message is generated to the originator.  Base operations uses a CM to provide the correctinformation.3.4.1. Sample Error Message:Base operations sends the following IFR proposal message:/B  FF ZSE  121200 KTCMYXYX  TCM1800031 FP LK04 F106/P 05000 TCM P1700 400\  TCM..PDX/0030   The computer sends the following error message to base operations:  FF KTCMYXYX 121220 KZSEZQZX  ERROR 031 05 SPD 05000This message tells you that base operations message 031, field 05 (air speed) is in error.3.4.2. Base operations CM. This is the only time when base operations personnel will repeat a mes-sage number-field 00.EXAMPLE:/B  FF ZSE  121225 KTCMYXYX  TCM1800031 CM 500NOTES: 1.  The ARTCC computer stores or holds an erroneous flight plan for a specified period of time.  This period varies between ARTCCs, but normally is no longer than 10 minutes after computer receipt.  If base operations personnel do not transmit a CM within the time frame established by the ARTCC, the entire flight plan must be resubmitted.   EXAMPLE: Computer Message:  ERROR 070 10 RTE..FLACK..FIX NOT STORED CM: TCM1908070 CM ..FLAAK..  2.  IFR proposed flight plan messages that contain errors and are sent to ARTCC computers outside or beyond the local ARTCC may not be identified back to the originator.  The message originator will receive a normal ARTCC computer acknowledgment and a rejection message will be identified at the ARTCC receiving the proposal.  EXAMPLE:   Ft Campbell KY (served by Memphis ARTCC) sends an IFR proposal message to Jacksonville ARTCC on an aircraft stopping over at Cairns AAF.  This message 20AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994has an error in the route of flight.  The Jacksonville ARTCC computer will acknowledge the message back to Ft Campbell and a rejection message will be printed out in Jacksonville center.  If the IFR mes-sage was sent to the wrong center, that ARTCC may generate a message back to originator indicating the error.  The originator is then responsible for transmission to the correct center.3.5. ARTCC Computer Acknowledgment Messages. When a flight plan message is accepted by theARTCC computer, an acknowledgment or "Roger" will be received as follows:EXAMPLE:FF KRNDYXYX 121320 KZCHZQZXR002Houston ARTCC computer (KZCHZQZX) acknowledges Randolph AFB (KRNDYXYX) IFR Message number 2.3.6. ARTCC Computer Identifying Number (CID). The CID is an automatic numbering system gen-erated by the ARTCC computer.  When a base sends an IFR flight plan message (e.g., LRF2100003) andthe message is correct, the ARTCC computer "Rogers" the message by sending the base "R003."  At thesame time, the ARTCC computer assigns an in-house CID.  If several IFR messages are sent on the sameaircraft, as is the case with the stopover flight plan, each message is assigned a CID.  Base operations per-sonnel are unaware of the CID but they may need the information under certain circumstances.   EXAMPLE:DUMP 55 is a C-130 operating out of Little Rock AFB on a stopover flight plan all within the Memphis ARTCC control area.  The stopover flight plan route is Little Rock AFB to Eaker AFB to Little Rock AFB to Memphis.  Little Rock AFB sends three messages:LRF0700002 (originating at Little Rock AFB)LRF0701003 (stopover at Eaker AFB)LRF0703004 (stopover at Little Rock AFB)Approximately 45 minutes before original departure, Little Rock base operations wants to amend the filed altitude of the stopover leg from Little Rock to Memphis.  Little Rock base operations sends the following:LRF1015012 AM DUMP55/LRF 09 260The ARTCC computer looks for DUMP 55 and finds two flight plan messages on DUMP 55 out of Little Rock AFB.  The computer sends this message to Little Rock AFB:ERROR 012 02 AID DUMP55 FILD DUPLICATIONLRF P1100 BYH P0930 LRF P0800This error message translates to: Error message 012, Field 02, aircraft identification (AID) DUMP 55 has more than one (duplication) flight plan message on file.  The computer message then identifies all the AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 199421messages on DUMP 55 using CID numbers, departure point, and proposed time.  Now base operations can amend the stopover leg out of Little Rock AFB using the CID (070): LRF0715010 AM 070 09 260.  3.7. Stereo Flight Plan. A stereo flight plan is used to activate a route of flight that is prestored in theARTCC computer.  The flight plan message may be entered with the stereo identification as the only field10 entry.  The departure location (field 06) must agree with the stereo departure point.  Variations fromthese procedures do occur within some centers.  Letters of agreement must be established between baseoperations and the applicable ARTCC.  Sample stereo entry:  /BFF ZAB192300 KABQYXYX ABQ1230025 SP TACO21 A7/P 450 P1530 300  LOLA36Field two must read SP.  If it reads FP then a computer error message, message too short, will be trans-mitted to the originator.  3.8. System Saturation. If the telecommunications system becomes saturated so that you cannot deliveryour IFR proposed flight plan messages, revert to these alternate procedures:Immediately verify with the ARTCC what the problem is.•• Coordinate with the center and telephone in your immediate IFR proposals; that is, those that areproposed for departure in less than 30 minutes.  Other IFR proposals will be voiced to the localFSS.• Avoid sending duplicate messages via the telecommunications system.   • Voice call all your message traffic, including departure notices, to the FAA FSS.• Notify your local flying organizations and ask them to submit their flight plans well in advance ofthe departure time. 22AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994Chapter 4 MILITARY TRAINING ROUTES (MTR)4.1. MTR Policy. Flight plans that indicate flights along MTR require special handling.  Flight plan fil-ing lead times and submission times to the ARTCC, as outlined in the FLIP Document, must be adheredto.   4.2. Scheduling Requirements. MTRs are scheduled in advance.  Instrument Routes (IR) and VisualRoutes (VR) cannot be used without being scheduled.  Unit scheduling organizations "owning" theseroutes provide base operations (with Service B capability) or the tie-in FSS with a daily schedule of routeusage.  Base operations personnel do not schedule these routes but will issue the scheduled usage to allFSSs, ARTCCs, and other base operations within 100 NM of the training route (see FLIP Document AP/1B).  Messages will include route identifier, time of use, and altitude involved.  (NOTE:  Slow-speed,low-altitude training routes are not to be transmitted, briefed on, or posted).  FAA FSS and ARTCCs arenot required to acknowledge MTR schedules.  While scheduling flexibility is necessary, local proceduresshould ensure that changes 2 hours before scheduled departure are held to a minimum.

Stopover Flight Plans. While multiple stopover flights are not authorized on the DD Form 1801,separate flight plan forms for subsequent legs of flight may be filed at the first departure aerodrome.  Theoriginating base operations will transmit the first flight plan message to the ARTCC controlling the depar-ture point.  Separate messages for the other legs may be transmitted by the originating base operations tothe base operations at each intermediate stop.  Base operations, in receipt of this flight plan information,will transmit the data to their local ARTCC facility.  EXAMPLE: McGuire base operations receivesICAO flight plans for a flight with intermediate stops at Lajes Field, Mildenhall RAF, and terminating atRamstein AB.  McGuire AFB sends the initial leg (McGuire to Lajes) to New York ARTCC for initialclearance.  They then transmit to Lajes base operations, the flight plan from Lajes Field to MildenhallRAF, and to Mildenhall base operations, the flight plan from Mildenhall AFB to Ramstein AB.  Upon28AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994receipt, Lajes Field and Mildenhall RAF will submit the appropriate flight plan to their air traffic controlfacility.5.3. ICAO Departure Message. Base operations personnel at the originating station will send all ICAOdeparture notification messages  (figure 5.2.).   Messages will be sent to the same agencies addressed inthe FPL message not including the originating ARTCC.  Figure 5.2.

General Information. Air traffic messages between the United States, Canada, and Mexico are con-sidered  transborder messages.  Military bases that experience difficulties in processing flight data to Can-ada should contact the Seattle FSS; for Mexico contact the San Antonio FSS.  These facilities will provideguidance, as necessary.  6.2. Canada Transborder Messages. Military base operations will transmit VFR and IFR departurenotification messages concerning aircraft landing in Canada.  Canadian FSSs will acknowledge VFRdeparture messages but normally do not acknowledge IFR departure messages.  6.2.1. Flight plans must indicate a designated airport of entry as point of destination.6.2.2. Transmit flight notification messages in the following format:  EXAMPLE:/B_________________System AuthorizationFFPrecedence________Date Time GroupIFRType Flt PlanCZYZZQZXAddresseeKOFFYXYXOriginatorM3456IdentC141TypeOFFDeptYYZDest1745ETAADCUS 6RemarksNOTE:  ADCUS 6 indicates that customs should be advised and that six persons are on board.

Transmittal of a flight notification message with "ADMISA" (Advise Customs and Public HealthServices) in the remarks is one method of satisfying this requirement.  6.3.1. Transmission of flight notification message will consist of the following items:• Aircraft identification.• Aircraft type.• Departure time.• Departure point.• Destination..• Estimated time en route.• Remarks:ADMISA, number of persons aboard, nationality, and pilot's  name (if customs notificationrequested).REQ ACK (request acknowledgment).EXAMPLE:/BFF MMMYYFYX 091540 KSKFYXYX A48750 C141 D1535 SKF ADN 0305 ADMISA 5US JACKSON REQ ACK6.3.2. The departure station is responsible for Search and Rescue (SAR) action until an acknowledg-ment is received from Mexico.  If an acknowledgment is not received within 30 minutes of transmis-sion time, the flight notification message should be retransmitted to the destination station and toMexico City (MMMXXMOW), which will then send an acknowledgment to the departure station andassume responsibility for the message.AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994336.3.3. As some Mexican facilities operate on a part-time basis, do not request SAR operations foroverdue aircraft unless the destination confirms that the aircraft has not arrived or circumstances indi-cate that an accident may have occurred.  Make inquiries to the destination station and Mexico Citywhen an acknowledgment has not been received within 2 hours of the aircraft’s ETA, provided this iswithin the hours of operation of the destination station. 6.3.4. If no reply is received within 1 hour after the inquiry is transmitted or if the reply is negative,initiate preliminary communications search actions and transmit an information request (QALQ) mes-sage to stations along the route within the United States. 6.3.5. If preliminary communications search actions are not successful, notify your tie-in FSS and askfor their assistance.  Maintain suspense files of all unclosed flight  plans until the aircraft is located,even though this may be for an indefinite period. 34AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994Chapter 7 MISCELLANEOUS MESSAGES7.1.

Notification may be made by message or telephone.  38AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994Chapter 8 OVERDUE AIRCRAFT8.1. Agency Responsibilities. Overdue aircraft communications search responsibility is shared betweenthe DoD and FAA.  The destination host base operations is responsible for preliminary communicationsearch activities, and the FAA destination tie-in FSS is responsible for all extended communication searchactions.  8.1.1. Destination Base Operations. If an inbound aircraft (including aircraft flying locally andround robin) has not arrived or communications cannot be established within 30 minutes after ETA,the destination host base operations will initiate preliminary communications search actions.• Contact local air traffic control agencies.  (This action frequently resolves questions regardingIFR aircraft.)Initiate a ramp check.•• Check adjacent airports.•If 1, 2, or 3 above fails to ascertain the aircraft's  whereabouts, transmit a "QALQ" message tothe original departure station and to each point of intended landing:EXAMPLE:/B FF SPS 091543 KSKFYXYX QALQ N2821Z   • Notify the destination tie-in FSS, by voice, of the overdue aircraft and the preliminary com-munications search actions taken.8.1.2. Action by Departure Station. Upon receipt of a QALQ inquiry, the departure station willcomplete a ramp check and local communications search for the aircraft.  This action should be com-pleted within 15 minutes.  If the aircraft is located, send the following message to the destination base,the destination tie-in FSS, and the controlling ARTCC:  EXAMPLE:/B FF SKF SAT KZHUZRZX 101650 KAFBYXYXN2821Z QAL 16258.1.2.1. If unable to locate the aircraft, immediately provide the destination and the destinationtie-in FSS with all flight plan information.

The military base operations will continue to cooperate with the tie-in FSS, as may be required.8.2. Extended Communications Search. Although the FAA is responsible for extended communica-tions search activity, the military base operations may be in receipt of communications search traffic thatwill require a response.  As a result, the following information is provided: (Ref: FAAH 7110.10, chap 8).  8.2.1. Information Request (INREQ) Message. If the reply to the QALQ is negative, or if the air-craft has not been located within 30 minutes after it becomes overdue (1 hour after ETA), the FAAwill:• Transmit  a  numbered  INREQ  message  to  the  departure  station,  flight  watch  stations  withcommunications outlets (see FAA M14 charts) along the route, other FSSs along the route,and the Rescue Coordination Center.  If these stations are within 50 miles of the Great Lakes,also transmit the INREQ to the Cleveland FSS.   Include all information in the INREQ message that will assist in search activities.  •EXAMPLE: /B DD REE SPS FTW MWL AUS SAT KZFWZRZX KZHUZRZX KRCCYCYX 091655 KSATYFYXINREQ N2821Z C172 TAS 110 D1320 REE 65 DCT MWL AUS SKF FEXHA 1720 PILOT JOHN JACOBS FONE 656-7823AF AERO CLUB ACFT 4POB WHITE WITH RED TRIM  NOTE:  INREQ messages are also addressed to ARTCCs along the route of flight and the Air Force Res-cue Coordination Center-KRCCYCYX.  An eight-letter identifier must be used when sending to the RCC. 8.2.2. INREQ Action Upon Receipt. All stations in receipt of an INREQ are required to take sometype of action.8.2.2.1. Departure Station will hold the INREQ message in suspense.   8.2.2.2. En Route Stations will seek information about the aircraft:• Check operational records.• Check airports in their area.• Check local Air Traffic Control agencies and initiate a ramp check.40AFJMAN11-213   26 AUGUST 1994• Reply to the INREQ within 1 hour.  If the reply contains pertinent information, send anumbered message to the INREQ originator.

ALNOT messages are sent 1 hour after transmission of theINREQ message, or upon FEXHA time, whichever comes first (if all inquires to the INREQ werenegative).  8.2.3.1. ALNOT messages contain all items of the INREQ plus any information received as aresult of the INREQ inquiries.  8.2.3.2. ALNOT messages are addressed with priority indicator of "SS".   8.2.3.3. The FAA calls the RCC at Scott AFB 10 minutes after issuance of the ALNOT to assuredelivery and to answer any inquiries.  8.2.3.4. ALNOTs are addressed to all Service B circuits serving the ALNOT search area plus theRCC.  NOTE:ALNOTs are not numbered.8.2.4. Receipt of ALNOT Action. Upon receipt of an ALNOT, each station whose area extends intothe ALNOT search area will:  8.2.4.1. Immediately conduct a communications search of those airports.  That could accommo-date the aircraft and were not checked during the INREQ status.  Notify originator of searchresults within 1 hour of receipt.  Use a numbered message.8.2.4.2. Deliver ALNOT information to adjacent terminal facilities.8.2.4.3. Request appropriate law enforcement agencies to check airports which could not be con-tacted, otherwise.8.2.4.4. Request search assistance from aircraft traversing the search area.8.2.4.5. Suspense ALNOT until canceled.8.2.5. Cancellation of INREQ or ALNOT. INREQs will be canceled by the originator of the mes-sage.  ALNOTs are canceled by the RCC or the facility that originated the message.  When informa-tion is received indicating an aircraft arrival, cancellation, extension of flight plan, or information thatthe aircraft has been located, the INREQ/ALNOT originator will transmit a cancellation message.
