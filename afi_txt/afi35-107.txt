Purpose.  This instruction outlines the guidelines for integrating  Internet, Web and related information  technologies  into  Air  Force  public  and  internal  communication  programs.  This instruction complements Air Force and Department of Defense policies and documents relating to  the  use  of  the  Internet  and  information  technology  in  public  and  internal  communication strategies.  It  also  outlines  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  Air  Force  Public  Web  (AFPW) Program. 1.2.  Overview.  All  Air  Force  public  websites  are  consolidated  and  centrally  hosted  as  part  of the AFPW Program. (T-0) The service-wide program saves the Air Force human, financial and technical resources while it establishes a standardized corporate image and content control for all websites.  New  digital  information  platform  choices,  to  include  interactive  technologies  (Air Force  social  media),  have  a  critical  place  in  Air  Force  communication  that  commanders, organizations  leaders  and  Public  Affairs  personnel  should  consider  essential  to  telling  the  Air Force story. 1.3.  Policy.  It is Air Force policy that: 1.3.1.  Authorized  users  of  unclassified  Air  Force  networks  comply  with  all  laws  policies, regulations,  and  guidance  concerning  communication  and  the  appropriate  control  of  Air Force  information  referenced  throughout  this  instruction  regardless  of  the  technology  used. (T-0) 1.3.2.  Publicly  accessible  Air  Force  websites  are  part  of  the  AFPW  Program  on  the American  Forces  Public  Information  Management  System  (AFPIMS)  content  management system  administered  by  the  Defense  Media  Activity  (DMA)  and  Air  Force  Public  Affairs Agency (AFPAA) with oversight from SAF/PA. (T-0) 1.3.2.1.  A communication plan needs to be created for all public-facing digital platforms, including  websites,  social  media  and  mobile  applications,  which  identifies,  at  a minimum,  the  purpose  and  intended  primary  audience.  See  AFI  35-101  for  information on  communication  planning.  (T-0)  The  communications  plan  will  include  a  site defacement plan that outlines what to do if a unit’s public site is defaced or hacked. This response should include, at a minimum, a system to monitor the site so the unit will know as quickly as possible when there is a problem, a plan to remove third-party content and response to query for media relations. MAJCOM PA and AFPAA will be notified by the unit site manager in the event of any public website or social media defacement. 1.3.2.2.  In addition to public web, there are a range of digital publishing options. If the primary audience is Airmen of a specific nature, the digital platform should not be public facing, but rather hosted on a platform behind a digital firewall. (T-1) 1.3.2.2.1.  Commanders are ultimately responsible for all information created, posted and maintained by members of their command when acting in an official capacity. (T-0)  Clearance  authority  of  material  for  the  public  is  at  the  office  of  origin  with  the direct  or  delegated  concurrence  of  the  unit  commander  and  review  of  local  Public Affairs personnel. (T-0) Public Affairs clearance is required for all material provided 6 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 to  news  media,  bloggers  or  others  as  responses  that  will  be  an  official  statement  of policy  for  a  unit  or  for  the  Air  Force.  While  acting  in  a  private  capacity,  such  as writing  a  personal  book  for  publication,  and  not  in  connection  with  their  official duties, Airmen may prepare information for public release through non-DoD media. However,  even  privately  prepared  information,  if  it  deals  with  elements  of  U.S.  Air Force, must be reviewed for clearance if it meets criteria in DODI 5230.29  Security and Policy Review of DoD Information for Public Release. (T-0) the  URLs  for  all  digital  publishing  platforms 1.3.2.2.2.  Any  person  maintaining  a  public-facing  digital  platform  identified  as officially  representing  the  Air  Force  or  any  unit  thereof  should  submit  the  Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to the respective MAJCOM and AFPAA for URL creation. All  units  will  submit to www.af.mil/AFSites/SiteRegistration.aspx, including a comprehensive list of social media sites and mobile applications. All website URLs will be indexed on the public websites  tab  of  the  official  Air  Force  website.  There  are  two  types  of  applications: web-based  applications  and  mobile  applications.  A  web-based  application  is  still  a website  and  falls  under  the  regulations  governing  websites.  (T-0)  A  mobile application  that  can  only  be  downloaded  for  use  on  a  mobile  device  and  cannot  be viewed on the World Wide Web falls under the Social Media Program guidance. 1.3.2.3.  The free flow of information between the government and the public is essential to  a  democratic  society.  It  is  also  essential  that  the  government  minimize  the  federal paperwork  burden  on  the  public,  minimize  the  cost  of  its  information  activities  and maximize  the  usefulness  of  government  information.  Websites  should  maintain  a Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  reading  room  page  with  material  that  has  been requested via FOIA or could be requested via FOIA. All Air Force websites must host a link to the Air Force FOIA page. (T-0) 1.3.2.4.  Anyone  maintaining  a  public-facing  digital  platform  should  carefully  consider the  content  distributed  to  the  world,  balancing  both  the  legal  requirement  for  an  open government and operational security. U.S. law and other guidance, including FOIA, Open Government Act, White House Social Media Guidance, eGovernment Act, and others—requires  the  release  of  all  records,  books,  papers,  maps,  photographs  or  other documentary materials. However, this free flow of information should be tempered with concern  for  security  of  U.S.  facilities,  personnel  and  information.  All  public-facing digital information  platforms  will  be  reviewed  by  an  annual  comprehensive multidisciplinary  review  board  IAW  paragraph  3.2.,  to  ensure  adherence  to  regulations and laws pertaining to security, privacy and copyright laws. (T-0) 1.3.3.  If  possible,  PA  units  should  procure  stand-alone  computers  with  corresponding Internet-based Capability to better facilitate public web and social media functions. Likewise, handheld mobile devices, when budgets permit, can significantly improve the capabilities of the  office  to  produce  digital  information  products  in  a  timely  manner  and  monitor  the look and  feel  of  products  created.  Examining  the  appearance  on  a  variety  of  browsers  and platforms is a best practice. 1.3.4.  Air  Force  public  websites  must  follow  hosting,  security,  procedural,  and  distribution practices  required  by  U.S.  law  and  DoD/Air  Force  regulations  and  instructions.  No documents  that  can  be  modified  or  altered  can  be  posted  to  any  website,  including  word AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 7 processing,  spreadsheets,  or  slide-based  documents.  All  documents  need  to  be  saved  in  a PDF  format  for  public  display  on  websites.  Articles,  biographies,  commentaries,  and  other content should be maintained in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format, which is the result  of  loading  the  articles  into  the  AFPIMS  content  management  system.  This  ensures optimal accessibility for sight-impaired users. (T-0) 1.3.5.  All  Air  Force public websites  will follow  the security  and access  controls  for public websites  and  other  new  media  as  outlined  in  AFI  35-102,  Security  and  Policy  Review Process. (T-0) 1.3.6.  All official Air Force public websites will use the top level internet domain “af.mil,” which  is  the  approved  government  domain  for  the  Air  Force.  Approved  exceptions  to  this policy include, but are not limited to, http://www.airforce.com, http://www.afreserve.com, http://www.afrotc.com,  and  http://www.goang.com.  Appropriate  academic  organizations can use the “.edu” domain under the guidance of Air Education and Training Command (for instance, http://www.afit.edu). Multiservice organizations will use the “.mil” domain. (T-0) 1.3.6.1.  Air  Force  Installation  and  Mission  Support  Center  Services  Directorate (AFIMSC)  websites  are  operated  and  maintained  outside  the  AFPW  program,  as  these websites  are  non-appropriated  fund  instrumentalities.  The  Services  Directorate  has oversight of the Air Force Services public web program. These sites are also required to comply with all U.S. laws and DoD regulations. 1.3.7.  Airmen have a responsibility to facilitate a free flow of information to the U.S. public that  is  accurate,  void  of  propaganda,  and  limited  only  by  security  restraints,  privacy considerations  and  respect  for  intellectual  property  rights  as  outlined  in  DoDD  5122.05 Responsibilities of Public Affairs. (T-0) 1.3.8.  Airmen  posting  information  to  public-facing  digital  information  platforms  in  an official  capacity  should  understand  the  benefits  of  communicating  via  the  range  of  public digital  information  platforms,  because  this  technology  provides  an  open  and  transparent conversation  with  online  consumers  of  information.  Unfortunately,  these  methods  of communication  have  provided  potential  adversaries  new  ways  to  gather  and  exploit information for their benefit. Balancing benefit and risk is critical. 1.3.9.  Security  at  the  Source  is  Paramount.  No  one  should  ever  release  classified,  For Official  Use  Only  (FOUO),  or  publically  damaging  information  about  the  Air  Force’s mission  that  would  assist  an  adversary.  (T-0)  No  one  should  ever  release  Personally Identifiable  Information  (PII)  on  Air  Force  publicly  accessible  websites.  (T-0)  It  may  be appropriate  to  establish  a  link  to  a  log-on  site  provided  details  of  the  controlled  site’s contents are not revealed. This link should include a notification that it points to a restricted site to ensure readers without CAC access understand this link will be inaccessible for them. 1.3.10.  Maximum  Disclosure,  Minimum  Delay.  In  keeping  with  the  DoD  principles  of information, the AFPW program should comply with the policy to make available timely and accurate  information  publically  available  so  that  the  public,  Congress,  and  the  news  media may assess and understand the facts about the U.S. Air Force. 1.3.11.  Balance  Security  and  Maximum  Release  Doctrine.  Using  basic  guidelines  such  as security,  accuracy,  policy,  and  propriety  (SAPP),  the  principles  of  information,  and 8 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 operational  security  (OPSEC)  regulations,  Public  Affairs  professionals  should  balance  the competing demands of maintaining security and maximizing release. AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 9 Chapter 2 ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

When requesting  assistance  for AFPIMS technical  issues, contact  the  DMA  Help  Desk.  (T-0)  Never  include  FOUO,  PII,  HIPPA  content  in  emails  to the  DMA  help  desk.  Never  mark  emails  to  the  DMA  help  desk  as  FOUO.  It  is  an organizational  email  box  and  not  rated  for  sensitive  content.  All  emails  to  the  DMA  help desk must include the senders name, email address, unit name, DSN and commercial email address.  If  this  information  is  already  included  in  a  signature  block,  the  signature  block  is sufficient. 3.2.  Multidisciplinary Review Boards (MDRB) and Quality Assurance (QA) Program 3.2.1.  Multidisciplinary  Review  Boards.  These  boards  will  be  conducted  annually,  using Attachment 2 of this instruction. The purpose of these boards are to ensure their websites are operating within the regulations of this AFI and practicing safe OPSEC and INFOSEC. 3.2.1.1.  Board  Chair.  Public  Affairs  offices  will  establish  and  chair  an  MDRB,  which will  consist  of  applicable  representatives  from  communications,  information,  legal, contracting,  and  security  offices  to  look  for  Privacy  Act  and  For  Official  Use  Only (FOUO),  legal,  contracting,  operation  security  (OPSEC),  and  other  issues  regarding information on public sites. (T-0) 3.2.1.2.  The boards will perform the following actions: AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 13 3.2.1.2.1.  Security  Check.  Perform  reviews  that  check  the  location’s  public website(s)  to  ensure  sensitive  information  from  the  operational,  PA,  acquisition, technology, privacy, legal, or security perspective is not present. 3.2.1.2.2.  Privacy  Check.  Ensure  the  public  site(s)  comply  with  privacy  policies regarding  restrictions  on  persistent,  third-party  cookies,  session  cookies  and  make sure  appropriate  privacy  and  security  notices  are  present  on  the  site  and  when collecting  personal  information,  include  appropriate  statements  and  advisories regarding the Privacy Act of 1974. 3.2.1.2.3.  Regulatory Compliance. Ensure the public site(s) comply with current law and  U.S.  government  and  DoD  policies,  to  include  the  1973  Rehabilitation  Act,  as amended  with  Section  508  requirements,  joint  ethics  regulation,  OMB,  etc.  A comprehensive and updated listing of DoD web and Internet based Capabilities laws and regulations is maintained on the DoD website. 3.2.2.  AFPW  Quality  Assurance  Program.  This  program  identifies  compliance  issues, suggests  improvements,  and  establishes  benchmarks  and  best  practices  for  the  AFPW Program  and  will  be  conducted  by  all  units  on  an  annual  basis.  MAJCOM,  base-level  and equivalent websites will use the Air Force Public Web QA checklist (see attachment 3). 3.3.  Website Content. 3.3.1.  General  Content.  Air  Force  public  websites  help  commanders  to  keep  the  general public informed with local news and information. Only information cleared for public release by the commander, or designated representative, in accordance with this instruction and other associated  policies  and  instructions,  can  be  posted  to  public  sites.  The  following  provides guidance on routine web content items: 3.3.1.1.  Mandatory Links. All links required by OBM Memo 05-04, Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites, along with the following links are mandatory (T-0): 3.3.1.1.1.  Electronic  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (FOIA)  Reading  Room  Material. Each site must link to the local installation FOIA site. Frequently requested material released as a part of the unit’s FOIA program may be posted to the website. (T-0) 3.3.1.1.2.  Links  to  Key  Leaders.  Official  biographies  are  maintained  in  the www.af.mil library. The release of names and duty information of personnel who, by nature  of  their  position  and  duties,  frequently  interact  with  the  public  (such  as flag/general  officers,  PA  personnel,  or  other  personnel  designated  as  official command spokespersons) is  allowed, but  shall not  reveal  names, addresses, or other PII of family members of Air Force employees or members (see paragraph 3.5.3. and AFI 35-113, Command Information.) Biographies are authorized for the Secretary of the  Air  Force,  Under  Secretary  and  assistant  secretaries  of  the  Air  Force,  Air  Force general officers on active duty or retired, Air Reserve and Air National Guard general officers,  Air  Force  personnel  assigned  as  pilots  to  the  Manned  Space  Program,  key Air Force uniformed and civilian personnel at all Air Force organizations and key Air Force  uniformed  and  civilian  personnel  in  the  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense (OASD). 14 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 3.3.1.1.3.  Links  to  Associated  Technologies.  Fact  sheets  maintained  by  MAJCOMs and posted on the www.af.mil library page provide basic information on aircraft and weapons systems in the Air Force inventory. 3.3.1.1.4.  Links  to  Higher  Headquarters  Sites.  Sites  must  link  to  public  sites belonging to higher headquarters within their organizational chain. 3.3.1.2.  Base  or  Unit  Fact  Sheets.  Maintained  locally,  base  fact  sheets  provide  general history, organization and economic impact of a particular unit or installation. 3.3.1.3.  Editorial  Content  (news,  features,  commentaries,  press  releases).  Locally produced news, cleared for public release, telling the unit’s story. 3.3.1.4.  Media.  Approved  local  photographs  and  videos  of  people  and  associated equipment helping tell the unit’s story. 3.3.1.5.  Detailed  Imagery.  Do  not  include  installation  maps  or  aerial  photography, including 360-degree views, on public websites. Do not include imagery of base security measures, gates, cameras, etc., as this can compromise security. Interactive maps already provided by third-party vendors may be displayed on Air Force public websites. 3.3.1.6.  Standard  Publications  and  Forms.  Standard  publications  and  forms  that  are  not exempt from release under FOIA may be made available through a link to the Air Force’s e-Publishing website at  http://www.e-publishing.af.mil/. Any government collection of information  using  forms  is  sensitive  and  legally  regulated.  All  forms  must  follow  the regulations  and  requirements  governing  DoD  and  U.S.  government  forms  creation  and management,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  DoD  Instruction  7750.7,  DoD  Forms Management Program and AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management. 3.3.1.7.  Paperwork  Reduction  Act.  Collection  of  any  information  other  than  contact information  from  private  citizens  is  heavily  regulated.  Websites  cannot  have  locally developed forms for the collection of data. Data collection must be accomplished through approved forms per AFI 33-360, Publications and Forms Management, to ensure security of the PII collected. (T-0) 3.3.1.8.  Contact Information. Contact information for the unit’s is required and should be visibly accessible from the main page of the unit’s website in addition to the  contact us link commonly found in the footer. Units should use generic or organizational email, not individual email addresses with people’s names. All contacts listed must be responsive to requests; the general guideline is within two working days for active units and two weeks for Guard or Reserve units. This requirement comes from the DODI 8550.01 on Internet-based Capabilities. (T-0) 3.3.1.9.  Comment  Policy.  Ensure  that  all  webpages  which  allow  users  to  comment  on content includes the following policy: 3.3.1.9.1.  USAF COMMENT POLICY: 3.3.1.9.2.  If you wish to comment, use the text box. The Air Force reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. 3.3.1.9.3.  This  is  a  moderated  forum.  That  means  all  comments  will  be  reviewed before posting. In addition, we expect that participants will treat each other, as well as AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 15 our agency and our employees, with respect. We will not post comments that contain abusive or vulgar language, spam, hate speech, personal attacks, violate EEO policy or are offensive to other or similar content. We will not post comments that are spam, are clearly "off topic," promote services or products, infringe on copyright protected material, or contain any links that don’t contribute to the discussion. Comments that make  unsupported  accusations  will  also  not  be  posted.  The  Air  Force  and  the  Air Force alone will make a determination as to which comments will be posted. 3.3.1.9.4.  Any  references  to  commercial  entities,  products,  services,  or  other nongovernmental  organizations  or  individuals  that  remain  on  the  site  are  provided solely  for  the  information  of  individuals  using  this  page.  These  references  are  not intended  to  reflect  the  opinion  of  the  Air  Force,  Department  of  Defense,  the  United States,  or  its  employees  concerning  the  significance,  priority,  or  importance  to  be given the referenced entity, product, service, or organization. Such references are not an official or personal endorsement of any product, person, or service, and may not be quoted or reproduced for the purpose of stating or implying Air Force endorsement or approval of any product, person, or service. 3.3.1.9.5.  Any comments that report criminal activity including suicidal behavior or sexual  assault  will  be  reported  to  appropriate  authorities  including  the  Air  Force Office of Special Investigation. 3.3.1.9.6.  Do not use this forum to: 3.3.1.9.6.1.  *  Report  criminal  activity.  If  you  have  information  for  law enforcement, please contact AFOSI or your local police agency. 3.3.1.9.6.2.  *  Submit  unsolicited  proposals,  or  other  business  ideas  or  inquiries. This site is not to be used for contracting or commercial business. 3.3.1.9.6.3.  *  Submit  any  claim,  demand,  informal  or  formal  complaint,  or  any other form of legal and/or administrative notice or process, or for the exhaustion of any legal and/or administrative remedy. 3.3.1.9.7.  The  Air  Force  does  not  guarantee  or  warrant  that  any  information  posted by  individuals  on  this  forum  is  correct,  and  disclaims  any  liability  for  any  loss  or damage resulting from reliance on  any such information. The Air  Force  may not  be able  to  verify,  does  not  warrant  or  guarantee,  and  assumes  no  liability  for  anything posted on this website by any other person. The Air Force does not endorse, support or otherwise promote any private or commercial entity or the information, products or services  contained  on  those  websites  that  may  be  reached  through  links  on  our website. 3.3.1.9.8.  News  media  representatives  are  asked  to  address  questions  to  the  public affairs through their normal channels and to refrain from submitting questions here as comments. Reporter questions will not be posted. 3.3.1.9.9.  We  recognize  that  the  web  is  a  24/7  medium,  and  your  comments  are welcome  at  any  time.  However,  given  the  need  to  manage  federal  resources, moderating  and  posting  of  comments  will  occur  during  regular  business  hours 16 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 Monday  through  Friday.  Comments  submitted  after  hours  or  on  weekends  will  be read and posted as early as possible; in most cases, this means the next business day. 3.3.1.9.10.  For  the  benefit  of  robust  discussion,  we  ask  that  comments  remain  "on-topic." This means that comments will be posted only as they relate to the topic that is being discussed within the blog post. The views expressed on the site by non-federal commentators  do  not  necessarily  reflect  the  official  views  of  the  Air  Force  or  the Federal Government. 3.3.1.9.11.  To  protect  your  own  privacy  and  the  privacy  of  others,  please  do  not include  personally  identifiable  information,  such  as  name,  Social  Security  number, DoD ID number, AFOSI Case number, phone numbers or email addresses in the body of your comment. If you do voluntarily include personally identifiable information in your  comment,  such  as  your  name,  that  comment  may  or  may  not  be  posted  on  the page.  If  your comment  is  posted,  your name will not  be redacted or removed.  In no circumstances  will  comments  be  posted  that  contain  Social  Security  numbers,  DoD ID numbers, AFOSI case numbers, addresses, email address or phone numbers. The default  for  the  posting  of  comments  is  "anonymous",  but  if  you  opt  not  to,  any information, including your login name, may be displayed on our site. 3.3.1.9.12.  Thank you for taking the time to read this comment policy. We encourage your participation in our discussion and look forward to an active exchange of ideas. 3.3.1.10.  The comment policy element is managed at the enterprise level on all AFPIMS websites. 3.3.1.11.  Comment  Response.  Some  basic  guidance  for  responding  to  comments  on public websites is provided here. 3.3.1.11.1.  Inappropriate Posts. Comply with the comment policy above, deleting or not  displaying  any  comments  which  include  vulgarities,  or  other  inappropriate content as delineated in the comment policy. 3.3.1.11.2.  Acknowledge  Mistakes.  Be  the  first  to  respond  to  mistakes  made  on websites. If an error is made, acknowledge the mistake and correct it quickly. 3.3.1.11.3.  Accuracy.  It  is  a  best  practice  and  encouraged  to  respond  officially  to positive  comments.  As  one  of  the  key  roles  of  Public  Affairs  is  to  provide  accurate information  to  the  public,  respond  enthusiastically  with  factual  information  to inaccurate information in comments. 3.3.1.11.4.  Evaluate  Negative  Comments.  When  negative  comments  are  posted, evaluate  them.  If  the  comment  is  an  objection  to  the  website  content  due  to  a misunderstanding,  provide  additional  information  to  help  clarify.  If  the  comment  is due to a genuine drawback discussed in the article, let it stand or provide additional information  that  might  provide  context  and  balance  to  the  discussion.  Do  not  delete comments simply due to the displeasure of the writer with content on a website. 3.3.2.  External Links. 3.3.2.1.  Criteria. The ability to hyperlink to external sources is a fundamental part of the World Wide Web and can add significant value to the functionality of a public website. Decisions must consider the informational needs of the site’s target audiences, as well as AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 17 the  unit’s  public  communication  and  community determinations must be consistent with the following considerations: relations’  objectives.  Such 3.3.2.2.  Mission  Support.  Links  to  non-DoD  website  resources  must  support  the organization’s mission. In addition, the organizations must link to all sites that have the same mission impact. For example, if you are linking to weather site for mission related weather  you  must  link  to  all  sites  that  provide  that  service.  External  links  must  be reviewed  periodically  to  ensure  continued  suitability  and  determine  if  the  link  is  not broken.  If  the  content  of  a  linked  external  site  becomes  questionable  or  objectionable, remove the link. 3.3.2.3.  No Endorsement. In accordance with DoD 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation, no product  endorsements  or  preferential  treatment  shall  be  given  on  Air  Force  public websites. 3.3.2.4.  No  Paid  Links.  No  payment  of  any  kind  should  be  accepted  in  exchange  for  a link placed on an organization’s public website. 3.3.2.5.  No  Specific  Browsers.  Air  Force  public  websites  should  not  require  or encourage users to choose any specific browser software. 3.3.2.6.  Link  Disclaimers.  To  avoid  the  perception  of  Air  Force  promotion  or endorsement,  links  to  commercial  organizations  such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  contractors who produce websites, non-military content providers, or event organizers and promoters must be avoided. If a link to a non-government website is considered for placement on an Air Force public site, the commander is responsible for ensuring that a proper disclaimer notice is  displayed  (see  paragraph 3.3.2.7.1. for  an example). The disclaimer must state that neither the Air Force nor the unit endorses the product(s) or organizational entity at the  hyperlink  destination.  The  disclaimer  must  also  state  that  the  Air  Force  does  not exercise  any  responsibility  or  oversight  of  the  content  at  destination.  This  disclaimer  is managed at the enterprise level for all AFPIMS websites. (T-0) 3.3.2.7.  Disclaimer  for  External  Links.  The  disclaimer  directed  in  DODI  8550.01  shall be displayed when linking to external sites: 3.3.2.7.1.  This  disclaimer  must  appear  on  the  page  or  pages  listing  external  links whenever a request is made for any site other than an official DoD website (usually the  .mil  domain)  or  U.S.  government  (usually  the  .gov  domain).  Under  no circumstances will a pop-up be used for this purpose due to the security vulnerability created  by  the  pop-up.  (T-0)  This  element  is  managed  at  the  enterprise  level  for  all APFIMS websites. 3.3.2.8.  Hyperlink Parameters. A link from an Air Force public website must relate to the mission  of  the  organization.  For  example,  if  members  of  an  organization  routinely interact  with  a defense contractor, it is  permissible to  point to that contractor’s website. The  link  must  not  go  to  the  primary  home  page,  but  specifically  link  to  the  page  that directly relates to official Air Force contracted business. 3.3.2.9.  Avoiding Impropriety. Once a decision is made to link to a non-U.S. government website, the unit may be required to link to similar sites. Any appearance of impropriety may be avoided with a notice identifying similar sources. The notice must state that links 18 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 to these sources do not constitute official or unofficial endorsement of goods or services by the U.S. Air Force and the organization, and that the list of sources is not necessarily all inclusive. 3.3.3.  Feedback.  Each  site  must  provide  a  means  to  provide  feedback  or  request  further information.  The  contact  us  form  is  maintained  on  all  AFPIMS  websites  to  fulfill  this requirement. 3.3.4.  Current Information. Information posted on a website must be kept current. It will be up to the MAJCOM, or equivalent, to ensure their subordinate sites are current. 3.3.5.  Search  Engine  Optimization.  Search  engine  “bots”  focus  on  key  content  including headlines, caption information,  “meta” tags, titles, and anchor words used in  links. To help the public access Air Force websites, it is recommended AFPIMS providers/managers follow these guidelines: 3.3.5.1.  Captioned Videos. Adding a transcript to a video or closed captioning improves the keyword search function for most search engines and better enable people to find the site’s video media. This is because the search engine “bots” require text to index. Video and audio file content isn’t visible to the indexing system. The only information visible to the  search  engines  is  either  the  meta  data  or  any  related  text  associated  with  the  video content. 3.3.5.2.  Metadata.  Make  use  of  the  “description”  and  “keywords”  meta  tags  in  the HTML code. These are automatic on sites in AFPIMS. 3.3.5.3.  Links. Write more descriptive anchor text identifying the hyperlink. Anchor text is  generally  the  blue  underscored  words  used  to  hyperlink  URLs.  Example:  Instead  of “Click  here”  use  “Click  for  the  Secretary  of  Defense’s  speech  on  International Security.” Searchable words should be included in the hyperlink text. 3.3.5.4.  Guide.  More  guidelines  can  be  found  by  entering  “search  optimization  guide” into a search engine. Also see the Air Force PA CoP on the Air Force portal for ongoing updated guidance. 3.4.  Usability Requirements:  Section 508. 3.4.1.  Accessible  Websites.  In  1998,  Congress  amended  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  to require that federal agencies make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. Section 508, 1194.22, Web-based Intranet and Internet Information and  Applications,  is  of  particular  importance  with  regard  to  website  management.  This section outlines the requirements for federal websites, both Internet and Intranet. It states that federal websites must meet the needs of disabled employees and members of the public and allow them access to Internet technology in a format understood by software readers/viewers. For  the  entire  list  of  requirements,  go  to  http://www.section508.gov.  There  are  a  range  of online automatic 508 Compliance checking websites available that recommend corrections to improve accessibility. (T-0) 3.4.2.  Video  Transcripts.  All  videos  require  transcripts  or  closed  captioning  if  uploaded  to public  websites.  Use  of  automatic  closed  captioning  through  social  media  platforms  is discouraged  as  it  currently  lacks  accuracy.  As  this  software  isn’t  fully  developed,  it  is recommended  to  have  someone  read  and  correct  the  automatically  transcribed  transcript  to AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 19 ensure accuracy. The preferred option is to post a full transcript with the video, which is used to  automatically  close  caption  the  video  through  sources  like  Defense  Video  &  Imagery Distribution System (DVIDS). (T-0) their  designated 3.5.  Inappropriate  Material  and  Prohibitions.  Commanders,  or representative, in coordination with PA professionals, have the oversight to determine what links may  or  may  not  be  posted  to  public  sites.  The  following  items  are  inappropriate  for  public websites: 3.5.1.  Inappropriate Links. Air Force public websites will not link to offensive or unrelated material. 3.5.2.  Operational and Personnel Security. Air Force public websites will not post references to any information that would reveal sensitive movements of military assets or personnel or the  locations  of  units,  installations,  or  personnel  where  anonymity  and  uncertainty  is  an element  of  security  of  a  military  plan  or  program  or  where  public  knowledge/disclosure would cause harm to military plans or programs. 3.5.3.  Copyright  Information.  Copyrighted  material  may  only  be  used  with  written permission from the owner (see AFI 51-303, Intellectual Property—Patents, Patent Related Matters,  Trademarks  and  Copyrights).  U.S.  laws  on  copyright,  primarily  17  U.S.C.  101, preserve, for the owner of copyrighted material, the benefits and earnings to be derived from the  reproduction  and  distribution  of  such  works.  Material  that  is  subject  to  copyright protection  includes  “original  works  of  authorship  fixed  in  any  tangible  medium…,”  17 U.S.C. 102(a). Computer software and sequences of code and instructions are also subject to copyright. (T-0) Per 17 U.S.C. 105, government works are not copyright protected. 3.5.4.  “Under Construction” Notice. “Under Construction” notices will not be used. 3.6.  AFPW  Conformity.  Public  websites  will  be  standardized  through  the  AFPW  Program. AFPIMS  is  a  content  management  system  that  simplifies  the  content  publishing  process  and gives a standardized look to all publicly accessible AFPW sites. 3.6.1.  Site Tools.  In order to  maintain continuity and standardization, site managers should not upload coding that will change the overall look of their unit’s website. 3.6.2.  Writing  Style.  To  keep  uniformity  with  other  services  and  save  manpower,  captions will follow DoD standards, using the DoD Captioning Style Guide. Articles and other written material shall comply with the Associated Press, Air Force, and local style guides. 3.6.2.1.  International Press Telecommunications Council. All digital media must include full  IPTC  information  within  the  metadata,  to  include  full  release  authority,  POC  name and contact information, not generic organizational information. 3.7.  Collection  of  Information.  Air Force public websites must comply with DoD limitations on the collection and use of user information. The use of cookies or other browser measures to gather information on public site users beyond statistical summaries is prohibited. Any collection of information of 10 or more members of the general public requires an OMB control number, this  includes  surveys,  customer  feedback,  and  social  media  posts.  Website  administrators  will ensure the appropriate privacy and security notices are included or linked to from the homepage. Also, all forms,  especially those used for  the collection of PII, must follow the regulations  and requirements  governing  DoD and U.S.  government  forms  creation and management, including, 20 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 but not limited to, DoD Instruction 7750.7, DoD Forms Management Program and AFI 33-360 Publications and Forms Management. (T-0) 3.8.  Public Website Policies.  A current list of policies affecting the management and operation of public websites in the Air Force is maintained at http://www.af.mil/WebPolicy.aspx. (T-0) AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 21 Chapter 4 ORGANIZATIONAL SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDANCE 4.1.  Purpose.  Public  Air  Force  social  media  sites  are  official  representations  of  the  Air  Force and must demonstrate professionalism  at  all times. While third-party social media sites are not owned  by  the  Air  Force,  there  are  guidelines  to  follow  for  the  management  of  social  media.  Social  media  sites  without  a  dedicated  Public  Affairs  office,  (i.e.  organizational  sites  below wing-level equivalent) should still adhere to the provisions outlined in this chapter. 4.2.  Overview.  Using  social  media  to  communicate  with  the  public  is  a  function  of  Public Affairs offices. Social media is any Internet-based or mobile device-based public communication product  created  to  educate,  entertain  or  stimulate  dialogue  between  two  or  more  users  through digital  transmissions.  Social  media  technologies  allow  users  to  post  opinions,  messages,  or information openly on a website or mobile device. 4.3.  Roles  and  Responsibilities.  In  order  to  communicate  effectively  and  efficiently,  social media presences are highly encouraged for wing-level units and above. Units below wing-level should  demonstrate  a  need  to  the  wing  Public  Affairs  office  to  have  official  social  media presences  since  wing-level  presence  is  sufficient  to  meet  most  units’  public  communication needs.  In  the  event  a  unit  elects  to  establish  a  social  media  presence  without  the  local  public affairs office consent, it will be the unit commander’s responsibility to ensure that the unit’s page is compliant with the guidelines outlined in this AFI. 4.3.1.  SAF/PA: 4.3.1.1.  Serve as the digital engagement liaison to third party platforms. 4.3.1.2.  Develop  guidance  for  the  integration  of  official  social  media  into  Air  Force communication programs. 4.3.1.3.  Develop guidance governing responsible and effective use of social media. 4.3.1.4.  Maintain a list of approved social media training for social media managers. 4.3.1.5.  Maintain  a  contact  roster  of  social  media  administrators  for  all  approved  SAF/ HAF accounts. 4.3.1.6.  Approve all official social media sites for registration with the AF Social Media Directory at http://www.af.mil/AFSites/SocialMediaSites.aspx 4.3.1.7.  Research  social  media  platforms  for  Air  Force  use.  Approve/disapprove  and manage social media Terms of Service Agreements on behalf of Air Force Public Affairs. 4.3.1.8.  Convene  a  review  board  for  new  outwards  facing  web  based  tools.

If the needs of  a subordinate unit  can be met with  the installation social media presence(s), the subordinate unit should work with the installation Public Affairs office to coordinate content. 4.3.4.4.  Review  content  daily  to  ensure  no  OPSEC  or  INFOSEC  violations  have occurred. 4.3.4.5.  Register  social  media  accounts  with  the  Air  Force  Social  Media  Directory  at http://www.af.mil/AFSites/SocialMediaSites.aspx  and  in  the  U.S.  Digital  Registry  at https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov. 4.4.  Social  Media  Management.  The  following  provides  guidance  on  routine  social  media items for official Air Force social media sites: AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 23 4.4.1.  Maintaining a Current  Site. Every public  Air Force social media  presence is  a direct reflection of the Air Force. A poorly maintained site can do more harm than not having a site at  all.  Unit  commanders  are  ultimately  responsible  for  maintaining  their  social  media presence(s), as well as all content posted to their site(s). Social media sites will be checked at least  once  every  24  hours  to  ensure  operational  security  (OPSEC)  and  security,  accuracy, policy, and propriety (SAPP) are not violated. (T-1) 4.4.2.  Registration.  Official  public  Air  Force  social  media  presences  must  be  registered  at www.af.mil/AFSites/SocialMediaSites.aspx  and  https://usdigitalregistry.digitalgov.gov. Closed social media sites will not be accepted in the registry. (T-0) 4.4.3.  Blogs.  Air  Force  Public  Web  at  AFPAA  has  the  authority  to  approve  establishing official  blogs.  Organizations  seeking  to  publish  an  official  public  blog  should  develop  and submit  a  blog  communication  strategy,  a  completed  blog  request  form  and  signed  MOA provided by AF Public Web to publicweb@us.af.mil. DMA Public Web manages blog sites and will delete a blog site if it has six months of inactivity (i.e., no blog posts for a six-month period). (T-3) 4.4.4.  Private  Social  Media  Presences  on  third  party  platforms.  Official  government  use  of private or closed social media groups are not authorized. Non-public information may not be released outside of the DoD network to include discussions on third party platforms. Doing so would constitute an unauthorized release of non-public information per 5 CFR 26635.703. If an organization is interested in hosting an official closed group, the group should be hosted behind firewall on a DoD approved network such as Milsuite or Intelink. Identification.  All  social  media  accounts  should  have 4.4.5.  Organizational the organization’s patch or logo, a link back to the organization’s .mil website, and a .mil email address  on  their  pages  to  verify  they  are  a  valid  U.S.  Air  force  page.  Additional  branding guidelines may be found in the Air Force social media guide. 4.4.6.  Disclaimers.  A  disclaimer  must  appear  on  a  unit’s  social  media  site  to  avoid  the perception  of  Air  Force  promotion  or  endorsement.  For  example,  “The  appearance  of external links on this site does not constitute official endorsement on behalf of the U.S. Air Force  or  Department  of  Defense.  The  Air  Force  does  not  endorse  any  non-federal government organizations, products, or services.” The disclaimer must also state that the Air Force  does  not  exercise  any  responsibility  or  oversight  of  the  content  at  external  link destination(s). 4.4.7.  Comment  Policies.  A  comment  policy  should  appear  on  official  public  social  media sites. The policy should address items audience members are not permitted to post to official Air  Force  social  media  sites,  such  as  profanity,  sexually  disparaging  remarks  or  racist comments.  (T-1)  Here  is  a  sample  Comment  Policy  on  the  About  Page  of  the  official  Air Force Facebook page: 4.4.7.1.  While this is an open forum, it's also a family friendly one, so please keep your comments and wall posts in good taste. In addition to keeping it family friendly, we ask that  you  follow  our  posting  guidelines  here.  If  you  don't  comply,  your  message  will  be removed. 4.4.7.2.  We recognize that the web is a 24/7 medium, and your comments are welcome at  any  time.  However,  given  the  need  to  manage  federal  resources,  moderating  and 24 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 posting  of  responses  to  comments  will  occur  during  regular  business  hours  Monday through  Friday.  Comments  submitted  after  hours  or  on  weekends  will  be  read  and possibly  responded  to  as  early  as  possible;  in  most  cases,  this  means  the  next  business day. 4.4.7.3.  We  will  not  allow:  Comments  or  submissions  that  contain  vulgar,  profane, hateful  or  abusive  language  or  images;  personal  attacks  of  any  kind;  or  offensive  terms that discriminate against specific ethnic, national or racial groups. 4.4.7.4.  Comments  that  are  spam,  are  clearly  "off  topic,"  or  that  promote  commercial services or products. Comments should be limited to those relating to the U.S. Air Force. Comments that make unsupported accusations will not be permitted. 4.4.7.5.  Comments that promote or advertise a business or commercial transaction. This includes  promotion  or  endorsement  of  any  financial,  commercial  or  non-governmental agency. 4.4.7.6.  Comments that suggest or encourage illegal activity. 4.4.7.7.  For  Official  Use  Only  (FOUO),  classified,  pre-decisional,  proprietary  or business-sensitive information. 4.4.7.8.  You  participate  at  your  own  risk,  taking  personal  responsibility  for  your comments, your username and any information provided. 4.4.7.9.  Finally, the appearance of external links on this site does not constitute official endorsement on behalf of the U.S. Air Force or Department of Defense. 4.4.7.10.  For  information  on  joining  the  U.S.  Air  Force,  please  visit  the  recruiting website and at https://www.facebook.com/USAirForceRecruiting. http://www.airforce.com/ or at Facebook page 4.4.7.11.  Emergency  information:  If  you  or  someone  you  know  in  the  Air  Force  is experiencing  an  emergency  or  suicide  situation,  please  contact  911  and  request assistance. 4.4.7.12.  Thank  you  for  your  participation  and  feel  free  to  send  us  comments  or suggestions on what you'd like to see or read about. 4.4.7.13.  This page is administered by (add your unit here). The following administrators may indicate their contributions using their initials as follows: 4.4.7.14.  TS: Ms. Teresa Smith 4.4.7.15.  VH: Capt Vicky Highlander 4.4.8.  Anonymous  Posts.  If  the  technology  allows  for  users  to  post  anonymously,  then organizations should allow the posts to be published. (T-0) 4.4.9.  Social Media Content. Organizations should have a list of content priorities as a basis for  items  that  should  be  posted,  as  well  as  a  working  list  of  topics  that  should  be  avoided, perhaps  due  to  sensitivity  or  controversial  issues.  These  lists  should  be  determined  by  the commander’s priorities and the public’s needs. AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 25 4.4.10.  External  Links.  Linking  to  external  sources  via  social  media  is  permitted  and encouraged. PA professionals should be educated consumers of information and be sure that an external source of information not only is an appropriate link coming from an official Air Force social media site, but also follows SAPP guidelines. Links should be related to the Air Force  mission  and/or  its  people.  Organizations  should  avoid  the  appearance  of  preferential treatment  when  determining  who  to  follow.  If  the  organization  elects  to  follow  one  local news organization, then all local news networks should be followed. 4.4.10.1.1.  Inappropriate  Material  and  Prohibitions.  The  following  items  are inappropriate for social media sites: 4.4.10.1.1.1.  Inappropriate Links. Air Force public sites will not link to offensive or unrelated commercial material. 4.4.10.1.1.2.  Personnel  Security.  Air  Force  social  media  sites  will  not  post references to  any information that would reveal  sensitive movements  of military assets  or  personnel  or  the  locations  of  units,  installations,  or  personnel  where uncertainty is an element of security of a military plan or program. 4.4.10.1.1.3.  Operational Security & Information Security. All content on an Air Force public social media site must be cleared for public release. Do not include material  that  is  classified  or  FOUO.  Do  not  include  scientific  and  technical information that has not been cleared for public release. (T-0) 4.4.10.1.1.4.  Personal Information. Use of personal information protected by the Privacy Act (AFI 33-332, Privacy Act Program) is prohibited. (T-0) 4.4.10.1.1.5.  Copyright Information. Copyrighted material may only be used with written  permission  from  the  owner  (see  AFI  51-303,  Intellectual  Property—Patents,  Patent  Related  Matters,  Trademarks  and  Copyrights).  U.S.  laws  on copyright,  primarily  17  U.S.C.  101,  preserve,  for  the  owner  of  copyrighted material,  the  benefits  and  earnings  to  be  derived  from  the  reproduction  and distribution  of  such  works.  Material  that  is  subject  to  copyright  protection includes  “original  works  of  authorship  fixed  in  any  tangible  medium…,”  17 U.S.C. 102(a).  It is now accepted that computer software and sequences of code and  instructions  are  subject  to  copyright.  (T-0)  Per  17  U.S.C.  105,  government works are not copyright protected. 4.4.10.1.1.6.  Political Activity. Links to any site that discuss political activity to include presidential or governor elections and or rallies. 4.4.10.1.1.7.  Content that encourages fans to comment off topic or with vulgarity should be avoided. (T-3) 4.4.10.1.1.8.  Surveys.  No  surveys  may  be  conducted  on  social  media  without proper approval. Per the Paperwork Reduction Act, all organizations are required to  obtain  an  Office  of  Management  &  Budget  control  prior  to  requesting information from the general public. (T-0) 4.4.10.1.1.9.  Crowd Sourcing. Units may not  use social media to  seek continual consensus,  recommendations,  or  advice  from  non-federal,  state,  or  local government  officials  acting  in  their  official  government  capacity  except  using 26 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 technology that is open to the general public. 4.4.11.  Transparency.  Transparency  is  defined  as  portraying  oneself  online  in  a  truthful manner  without  falsifying  identity  or  credentials.  Do  not  forge  or  otherwise  manipulate identifiers in your post in an attempt to disguise, impersonate, or otherwise misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any other person or entity. 4.4.12.  Terms  of  Service.  Federal-compatible  Terms  of  Service  agreements  are  special agreements  negotiated  between  the  federal  government  and  vendors  who  offer  free  social media,  mobile,  business  and  other  digital  tools.  These  federal-compatible  TOS  agreements modify  or  remove  problematic  clause  in  standard  TOS  agreements  and  allow  federal employees  to  legally  us  these  tools.  Before  deciding  to  use  a  social  media  tool  (e.g. Facebook,  Instagram,  or  twitter.),  organizations  should  seek  the  advice  of  the  Air  Force Social Media team for an updated list of federal-compatible terms of services. (T-0). 4.4.13.  Live Streaming. All live streamed events should be constantly manned with plan to take it off-line in the event of violence, crime or imagery unsuited for public consumption. 4.4.14.  Records Management. All web 2.0 content is a Federal Record and must be retained per  the  Federal  Records  Act  and  National  Archives  and  Records  Administration  and  Air Force records schedules. If a records schedule has not been created for the Web 2.0 content, the sponsor of the Web 2.0 products must retain all content until a records schedule is created and the content may be disposed of per the schedule. The Air Force must retain control of all of its records and may not store them on third party products not under contract with the Air Force to provide storage of records. Official Air Force social media pages should follow the guidelines in the Air Force Social media guide and archive their content once a month. AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 27 Chapter 5 PERSONAL USE SOCIAL MEDIA GUIDANCE 5.1.  In  general,  the  Air  Force  views  personal  Web  sites  and  weblogs  positively,  and  it respects  the  right  of  Airmen  to  use  them  as  a  medium  of  self-expression.  However,  all Airmen (Military and Civilian) have limitations of free speech. In addition to specific ethics and Hatch  Act  limitations,  civilians  are  prohibited  from  discussing  the  intricacies  of  the  Air  Force and  the  Department  of  Defense.  Active  duty  members  as  members  of  the  Air  Force,  Airmen must abide by certain restrictions to ensure good order and discipline. All Airmen are on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and their actions on and off duty are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Airmen should also remember OPSEC when posting information in the digital environment. 5.2.  Airmen are free to repost publicly released information on their personal social media accounts. 5.3.  Airmen  should  use  their  best  judgment,  remembering  that  there  are  always consequences  to  what  is  written.  If  they’re  about  to  post  something  that  is  questionable  and may  reflect  negatively  on  the  Air  Force,  they  should  review  this  and  other  relevant  guidance thoroughly. 5.4.  If  still  unsure,  and  the  post  is  about  the  Air  Force,  they  should  discuss  the  proposed post  with  their  supervisor  or  the  PA  office.  Ultimately,  however,  Airmen  are  solely responsible for what they post. 5.5.  Do  not  post  any defamatory,  libelous,  vulgar,  obscene,  abusive, profane,  threatening, hateful, racially, ethnically, or otherwise offensive or illegal information or material. 5.6.  Do  not  post  any  information  or  other  material  protected  by  copyright  without  the permission of the copyright owner. 5.7.  Do not use any words, logos or other marks that would infringe upon the trademark, service mark, certification mark, or other intellectual property rights of the owners of such marks without the permission of such owners. 5.8.  Do  not  post  any  information  that  would  infringe  upon  the  proprietary,  privacy,  or personal rights of others. 5.9.  Do not post any non-public information (as defined in 5 CFR 2635.  703) this includes but not limited to classified or sensitive information, unless such release is a protected disclosure per an appropriate Whistleblower statute. 5.10.  Do  not  forge  or  otherwise  manipulate  identifiers  in  posts  in  an  attempt  to  disguise, impersonate,  or  otherwise  misrepresent  their  identity  or  affiliation with  any  other  person or entity. 5.11.  Airmen  cannot  use  their  service  affiliation  for  fundraising  purposes  on  personal social  media  accounts  except  for  OPM  approved  fundraisers  such  as  CFC  and  the  Air Force Associations.  (T-0) 28 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 5.12.  Airmen  should  not  use  government  email  accounts  to  establish  personal accounts.  (T-0) 5.13.  Airmen  cannot  invite  other  government  employees  to  participate  on  social  media accounts via a government email address.  (T-0) 5.14.  Employees  should  not  use  their  official  position  on  personal  accounts  unless  it’s  a biographical detailed accompanied by biographical facts including official photos. 5.15.  All  political  activity  on  personal  pages  must  be  in  compliance  with  the  guidance provided by the Office of Special Counsel (T-0).  EDWARD W.

Content  Management  System—The  software  application  used  to  upload,  edit  and  manage content displayed on an Air Force website. Metadata—Metadata  describes  other  data.  It  provides  information  about  a  certain  item’s content.  Web  pages  often  include  metadata  in  the  form  of  meta  tags.  Description  and  keyword meta tags are commonly used to describe the Web page’s content. Most search engines use this data when adding pages to their search index. Meta Tag—This is a special HTML tag that is used to store information about a web page but is not  displayed  in  a  web  browser.  For  example,  meta  tags  provide  information  such  as  what program was used to create the page, a description of the page and keywords that are relevant to the  page.  Many  search  engines  use  the  information  stored  in  meta  tags  when  they  index  Web pages. Mobile  App—App  is  short  for  “application,”  which  is  the  same  thing  as  a  software  program. Unlike  applications  for  traditional  computers,  which  are  normally  website-based  applications, mobile apps can only be obtained by downloading them from an online app store. Most devices automatically  install  apps  when  downloaded,  which  creates  a  seamless  installation  process  for the user. Official  Use—For  the  purposes  of  this  Instruction,  includes  authorized  communication  or activities conducted as an assigned DoD employee function. Personally  Identifiable  Information—(PII)—Information  about  an  individual  that  identifies, links, relates, or is unique to, or describes him or her (e.g., a social security number; age; military rank;  civilian  grade;  marital  status;  race;  salary;  home  or  office  phone  numbers;  other demographic,  biometric,  personnel,  medical  and  financial  information,  etc.).  Such  information can  be  used  to  distinguish  or  trace  an  individual’s  identity,  such  as  his  or  her  name;  social security  number;  date  and  place  of  birth;  mother’s  maiden  name;  and  biometric  records, including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to a specified individual. Private  Internet  Service—A  U.S.  Air  Force  Internet  service  with  access  controls  in  place  to limit  availability  of  non-public  information  or  exchanges  of  non-public  information  to  specific audiences. The Air Force Portal is a good example. Public  Web—A U.S.  Air Force  Internet  service  on the World Wide Web used to  disseminate, store  or  otherwise  process  information  that  has  been  cleared  and  authorized  for  release  to  the public. Sensitive  Information—Unclassified  information  requiring  special  protection  from  disclosure that  could  cause  compromise  or  threat  to  our  national  security,  an  Air  Force  organization, activity, military member, AF civilian, DOD contractor, or family member. Social  Media—An  online  social  platform  or  site  used  to  share  information,  communicate,  and build relationships with the public. 32 AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 Social  Media  Sites—Any  online  social  platform  used  to  communicate  a  message,  share information,  or  build  relationships.  These  platforms  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest and Twitter. Terms  of  Service  (ToS)—An  agreement  between  DoD  and  an  IbC  provider  establishing  the rights and responsibilities of the parties which covered the USAF as a DoD entity with respect to the official use of the IbC by DoD authorized users. ToS agreements do not include procurement contracts  and  may  not  create  financial  obligations  or  liabilities  on  behalf  of  the  U.S. Government. Web-based  App—App  is  short  for  “application,”  which  is  the  same  thing  as  a  software program. Web-based apps are hosted on websites and, as such, are subject to all IbC regulations and  laws  as  standard  U.S.  Air  Force  public  websites.  They  can  be  viewed  from  computers  or Internet-enabled smart phones.  AFI35-107  15 MARCH 2017 33 Attachment 2 AIR FORCE PUBLIC WEB Table A2.1.  Multidisciplinary Review Board Checklist.
