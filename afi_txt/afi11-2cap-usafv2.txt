Units will conduct all evaluations according to the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2, and this instruction. (T1) 1.2.  Procedures: 1.2.1.  Flight  examiners  (FE)  will  use  the  evaluation  criteria  in  Chapter  3  for  conducting flight  and  emergency  procedures  evaluations  (EPE).    To  ensure  standard  and  objective evaluations,  FEs  must  become  thoroughly  familiar  with  the  evaluation  requirements  and criteria in this instruction. (T2) 1.2.2.  Unless specified, the examinee will fly in the seat that best enables the FE to conduct a thorough  evaluation.    The  FE  normally  occupies  the  left  seat  during  periodic  instructor mission evaluations. (T2) 1.2.3.  Prior to the flight, the FE will brief the examinee on the purpose of the evaluation and how it will be conducted.  The examinee will accomplish required flight planning during the evaluation and will furnish the FE a copy of necessary mission data and maps (as required). (T2) 1.2.4.  The  FE  will  thoroughly  debrief  all  aspects  of  the  evaluation.    Debriefs  include  the examinee’s overall rating, specific deviations, area grades assigned (if other than qualified), and any required additional training.  If the overall grade is Q-2 or Q-3, the FE must notify CAP-USAF/XOV. 1.2.5.  FEs  must  be  glass  cockpit  (G-1000)  certified  to  give  initial  or  periodic  qualification (QUAL)  or  instrument  (INSTM)  evaluations  to  G-1000  certified  members  in  a  G-1000 aircraft. 1.3.  Grading Instructions: 1.3.1.  Tolerances  in  performance  parameters  are  based  on  conditions  of  smooth  air  and  a stable  aircraft.    Do  not  consider  momentary  deviations  from  tolerances,  provided  the examinee  applies  prompt  corrective  action  and  such  deviations  do  not  jeopardize  flying safety.  Consider cumulative deviations when determining the overall grade. 1.3.2.  FEs will use the evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 and Table 3.1 to determine individual area grades.  When individual areas are performed well above the grading criteria standards, make an appropriate comment under Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form  8,  Certificate  of  Aircrew  Qualification,  stating  performance  and  (or)  instruction  was commendable.    FEs  must  use  judgment  when  the  evaluation  criterion  is  subjective  or  the specific situation is not covered. 1.3.3.  FEs  will  derive  the  overall  flight  evaluation  grade  (Q-1,  Q-2,  or  Q-3)  from  the  area grades,  based  on  a  composite  for  the  observed  events  and  tasks  according  to  AFI  11-202, Volume 2, this instruction, and FE judgment.   If  the examinee receives an unqualified area grade  in  any  of  the  areas  identified  by  this  instruction,  the  FE  will  assign  an  overall unqualified grade (Q-3). AFI11-2CAP-USAFV2  25 MARCH 2015   5  1.3.4.  Critical  areas  require  adequate  accomplishment  by  the  examinee  in  order  to successfully achieve the mission objectives.  If the examinee receives an unqualified grade in any critical area, the overall grade for the evaluation will be unqualified (Q-3).  Critical areas are identified in Chapter 3.  Grade critical areas as "Q" or "U." 1.3.5.  The general evaluation criteria in Table 1.1 apply during all phases of flight (except as noted in Table 3.1 for specific events). Table 1.1.  General Evaluation Criteria. A I T E M 1  Altitude General Area B Q +100 feet 2  Airspeed +10 knots 3  Heading Rolls out and maintains +5 degrees of desired heading D U Exceeds Q- limits C Q- +150 feet +15 knots Rolls out and maintains +10 degrees of desired heading 1.4.  Emergency  Procedures  Evaluation  (EPE).  FEs  will  administer  an  oral  EPE  on  the ground  or  in  flight.    The  FE  will  include  a  sampling  of  emergency  procedures  resolved  to  a logical conclusion. 1.4.1.  The FE will include an evaluation of the following items on the EPE: 1.4.1.1.  General  Knowledge.  Evaluate  aircraft  systems  and  operating  procedures,  the national airspace system, and nontowered airfield operations. 1.4.1.2.  Emergency Procedures.  Evaluate all BOLDFACE or critical action procedures and at least one emergency procedure. 1.4.2.  Units will not permit examinees receiving an overall unqualified grade (Q-3) because of  an  unsatisfactory  EPE  to  fly  in  any  aircrew  position  until  the  examinee  completes  a successful reevaluation. (T2) 1.4.3.  For each EPE graded “qualified with additional training required,” the FE will indicate whether the additional training must be accomplished before the next flight. 1.5.  Completing  AF  Form  8.  Evaluators  record  aircrew  member  qualifications  using  the  AF Form 8 in accordance with (IAW) AFI 11-202, Volume 2. 1.5.1.  With  the  exception  of  restrictions  and  exceptionally  qualified  designation  (if  used), place all comments on the reverse side of the AF Form 8 or 8a. 1.5.2.  Record  additional  aircraft  upgrades,  not  requiring  a  flight  evaluation,  on  AF  Form 4348, USAF Aircrew Certifications, and maintain in the flight evaluation folder. 1.6.  Waiver  and  Approval  Authorities.  HQ  AF/A3O  is  the  waiver  authority  for  training requirements  established  by  AFI  11-202,  Volume  1,  or  as  stated  in  the  AFI.    Except  where specified in this instruction, each MAJCOM Director of Operations (A3) is the waiver authority   6  AFI11-2CAP-USAFV2  25 MARCH 2015 for individual aircrew provisions of this instruction.  Units will submit waiver requests through the chain of command to the OPR. AFI11-2CAP-USAFV2  25 MARCH 2015   7  Chapter 2 EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS 2.1.  General.  There  are  four  types  of  evaluations  in  CAP-USAF  aircraft:  QUAL,  instructor (INSTR),  INSTM,  and  SPOT.    The  requirement  for  a  mission  evaluation  is  waived  by  this instruction according to the provisions of AFI 11-202, Volume 2.  Evaluations include requisites and required areas.  Table 2.1 indicates when a requisite is required for an evaluation.  Table 2.2 prescribes required areas that must be included in the flight evaluation profile.  Evaluation areas are aligned under the type of evaluation. 2.1.1.  For the purposes of this instruction, all CAP-USAF aircraft are a single USAF mission design series equivalent, although additional aircraft equipment certifications may be required according to AFI 11-2CAP-USAF, Volume 1. 2.1.2.  When it is impossible or impractical to evaluate a required area in flight, the FE may evaluate  it  by  oral  examination  to  complete  the  evaluation.    Instrument  approaches  and landings  cannot  be  evaluated  orally.    Document  the  oral  evaluation  in  the  Examiner’s Remarks in the Comments block of the AF Form 8.  If the FE determines the required item cannot  be  adequately  evaluated  orally,  the  examinee  will  require  an  additional  flight  to complete the evaluation. 2.1.3.  A publications check is not required. 2.2.  Requisites.  Table 2.1 indicates the minimum requisites for each type of evaluation.  When periodic evaluations are combined, accomplish all requisites for each evaluation and document in the ground phase of the AF Form 8. Table 2.1.  Evaluation Requisites. A I T E M 1  Open Book Exam Requisite 2  Closed Book Exam 3  BOLDFACE Exam 4 Instrument Exam 5  EPE Legend:  R = Required B C D E QUAL INSTM  INSTR  SPOT R R R  R    R  R          2.3.  Pilot  Evaluations.  All  pilot  evaluations  are  combined  QUAL  and  INSTM  evaluations.  The  examinee  normally  flies  in  the  left  seat.    Area  navigation  (RNAV)  approaches  will  not satisfy both precision and non-precision approach requirements on evaluations (i.e. at least one of the approaches will be non-RNAV).   8  AFI11-2CAP-USAFV2  25 MARCH 2015 2.3.1.  Use either a precision approach radar (PAR), instrument landing system (ILS), or area navigation  approach  (RNAV)  localizer  performance  with  vertical  guidance  (LPV)  decision altitude (DA) [if Wide-Area Augmentation System (WAAS) equipment is on the aircraft] to satisfy the precision approach requirement. 2.3.2.  Use  either  an  airport  surveillance  radar  (ASR),  very  high  frequency  omnidirectional range  (VOR),  localizer  (LOC),  or  area  navigation  approach  to  satisfy  the  nonprecision approach requirement. 2.4.  Instructor Pilot Evaluations.  To initially qualify as an instructor, a pilot must successfully complete  a  dedicated  initial  instructor  evaluation.    Subsequently,  crewmembers  designated  as instructors  will  be  evaluated  on  their  ability  to  instruct  during  all  periodic  evaluations.    All periodic  INSTR  evaluations  are  combined  with  aircraft  QUAL/INSTM  evaluations  to  evaluate both  proficiency  and  instructor  ability.    The  examinee  normally  flies  in  the  right  seat,  but  left-seat evaluations may be accomplished.  The FE will act as a student for the purpose of evaluating the examinee’s instructional ability.  Include at least one maneuver from each of areas 20 to 23, 27 to 29, 35 to 38, and 47 to 48 in the flight evaluation profile. Table 2.2.  Evaluation Requirements.
