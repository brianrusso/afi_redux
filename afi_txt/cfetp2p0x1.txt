The CFETP was developed using a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Precision Measurement Equipment Laboratory Career Field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The following training decisions were made at the career field U&TW held at AFMETCAL, Heath, Ohio, 19 – 21 March 2014:  10         3.1.  Initial Skills Training.  A decision was made to revise the resident course.  Major changes included the addition of the following training items:  The use of the Air Force Calibration Viewer (AFCAV), Metric/English unit conversions, and Pressure conversions.  Once the appropriate equipment is procured, the use and calibration of digitizing oscilloscopes will be added.  The required level of training was changed on four objectives to better reflect the level of training required by the field at this skill level.  There were no elements of training deleted during this U&TW. 3.2.  Five-Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  The 5-level CDC was revised to update equipment and procedures to reflect what is actually in use in the field.  Additionally, a few tasks were realigned from the 7-level to 5-level  CDCs to better agree with normal career field progression.  3.3.  Seven-Level Upgrade Training Requirements.  The 7-level CDC was updated to reflect changes in equipment and procedures taking place in the field.  The Process Review will be also be added to the 7-level CDC. 3.4.  Proficiency Training.  Any additional knowledge and skill requirements not identified as initial skills or upgrade training were assigned to the Continuation Training Program.  The purpose of continuation training is to provide additional training that exceeds minimum training requirements.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  Emphasis is on present and future duty positions. 4.

This section identifies known resource constraints, which preclude optimal/desired training from being developed or conducted, including information such as cost and manpower. Narrative explanations of each resource constraint and an impact statement describing what effect each constraint has on training are included.  Also included in this section are actions required, office of primary responsibility, and target completion dates.  Resource constraints will be, as a minimum, reviewed and updated annually. 17        2.  Apprentice-Level Training. 2.1.  Constraints.  There are no constraints in starting the new E3ABR2P031 0B1D apprentice course. 3.  Five-Level Training. 3.1.  Constraints.   New training requirements listed in CTS E3AZR2P051-0A1D will be implemented 120 days after receipt of new equipment.  A course resource estimate (CRE) has been routed reflecting the resource constraints for course  E3AZR2P051-0A1D supplemental course which are: NIDA Trainer Digital Troubleshooting Kit and NIDA Trainer software license agreement.  All other assets required for new training are on hand to include: NIDA Trainer (130E), Digital Multimeter (70/73 III), Function Generator (BK 4001) and Oscilloscope (DPO2012).    There is no impact to manpower.  However, it is important to note that the current course is family grouped with the PMEL Apprentice course (E3ABR2P031 0B1D).  We are currently working to justify a change to the family group to include only the PMEL Supplemental courses (E3AZR2P051 0A1C, E3AZR2P051 0T1C and E8AUR2P051 0P1A).  If the request is approved the course may gain an instructor requirement.  This requirement will be transferred from the TACAN course (E3AZR2P051 0T1C) scheduled for discontinuation and will be identified in the Advanced Calibration course training plan.  Once the CRE is approved and assets attained a course training plan (CTP) will be completed within the time frame stated above to bring training online.  The OPR for CTP 335 TRS 2P0X1 Training Manger (TM), currently MSgt Antonio R. Washington, and can be reached at: 335trs.ttr@us.af.mil or DSN: 597-0153  4.  Seven-Level Training. 4.1.  Constraints.  None  SECTION E – TRANSITIONAL TRAINING GUIDE- There are no transitional requirements, this area is reserved. 18            PART II Section A -  SPECIALTY TRAINING STANDARD 1.  Implementation.  This Specialty Training Standard (STS) will be used for training provided  by Air Education and Training Command for first class beginning 141006 and graduating 150413. 2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201 this STS: 2.1.  Lists in the column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) the most common tasks, knowledge, and Technical References (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level. Number task statements sequentially i.e., 1.1, 1.2, and 2.1 Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.   These are based on an analysis of the duties in  AFECD.  All 3-Level training items are wartime course objectives. 2.2.  Provides certification for OJT. Column 3 is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements. Use automated training management systems to document technician qualifications, if available. Task certification must show a certification or completed  date. (As a minimum, use the following column designators: Training Complete, Certifier  Initials.)  When two codes are used in column 4a, the first code is the established requirement for  resident training on the task/knowledge, and the second code indicates the level of training  provided in the course due to equipment shortages and other resource constraints. 2.3.  Shows formal training and correspondence course requirements. Column 4 shows the  proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the  task  and  knowledge  and  the  career  knowledge  provided  by  the  correspondence course. 2.4.  Qualitative  Requirements.  Attachment  1  contains  the  proficiency  code  key  used  to indicate  the  level  of  training  and  knowledge  provided  by  resident  training  and  career development courses.  2.5.  Document  and  certify  completion  of  training  IAW  AFI  36-2201,  Chapter  6  and  the approved automated training management system guides. Supervisors, trainers, and trainees must ensure all training documentation is contained within an Airman’s Individual Training Plan (ITP). 2.6.  Is a guide for development of promotion tests used in the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS). Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields. The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades. Questions are based upon study references listed in the Enlisted Promotions References and Requirements Catalog (EPRRC). Individual responsibilities are in Chapter 1 of AFI 36-2605, AF Military Personnel Testing System. 19   3.  Proficiency Code Keys.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate  level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and CDCs. 4.  Recommendations.  Comments and recommendations are invited concerning the quality of  AETC Training.  A Customer Service Information Line (CSIL) has been installed for the supervisors’ convenience.  For a quick response to concerns call our CSIL at DSN 597-4566, or  fax us at DSN 597-3790 or e-mail us at 81trg.tget@us.af.mil.

Introduction.  Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective. An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task. Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard that states what is expected of the student for each task. The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc). The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check). The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained (i.e. “with no more than two instructor assists”). AETC course objectives and associated information are published in the Plan of Instruction (POI) for each of the courses identified in Section D, below, Training Course Index.  2.  Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge which  is measured using a written test, PC indicates required task performance which is measured with a  performance progress check, and PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and  performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check. 3.  Standard.  The standard is 70% on written examinations.  Standards for performance measurement  are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress checklist.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained. 4.  Proficiency Level.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The  student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task. Section C - SUPPORT MATERIAL NOTE:  There are currently no support material requirements.  This area is reserved.
