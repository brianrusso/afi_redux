HIPAA within the Air Force Medical Service.  The purpose of HIPAA is to improve the portability  and  continuity  of  health  insurance  coverage,  improve  access  to  long  term  care services and coverage, and to simplify the administration of healthcare.  A primary component of HIPAA  administrative  simplification  provisions,  45  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  Parts 160 and 164, is  the protection and privacy of individually identifiable health information.   The HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  governs  this  component,  and  DoD  6025.18-R,  DoD  Health  Information Privacy  Regulation,  implements  the  requirements  of  the  HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  throughout  the MHS.  Reference to sections of the DoD 6025.18-R also includes reference to the same content in  any  successor  issuances.    This  AFI  applies  to  all  organizational  units  and  military,  civilian, contractor and volunteer staff working at Air Force military treatment facilities.  (T-0) 1.2.  Interaction  Between  HIPAA  Privacy  and  Patient  Administration  Functions.  Many of the  HIPAA  Privacy  implementation  requirements  set  forth  by  DoD  6025.18-R  are  functions inherently  conducted  by  TRICARE  Operations  and  Patient  Administration  (TOPA)  personnel within  the  Medical  Treatment  Facility  (MTF).    Various  sections  of  AFI  41-210  also  include policy and guidance relating to certain aspects of HIPAA. 6 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 Chapter 2 ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.

HIPAA covered entities must comply with the administrative, technical, and physical requirements, described in the HIPAA Privacy Rule and DoD 6025.18-R, including but not limited  to,  adequate  safeguards,  policies  and  procedures,  document  retention  requirements, sanctions  for  members  of  the  workforce  who  fail  to  comply  with  the  privacy  policies  and procedures, training, and refraining from intimidating or retaliatory acts.  (T-0) 3.1.1.1.  Health  care  personnel  and  related  assets  of  the  Department  of  the  Air  Force under the management authority or employed by the Surgeon General  of the Air Force, including  Headquarters  staff,  operating  agencies  (such  as,  but  not  limited  to,  the  Air Force  Medical  Support  Agency  and  the  Air  Force  Medical  Operations  Agency),  Major Command  Surgeons  General,  and  any  other  organizational  level  within  the  Air  Force Medical Service, are part of the AFMS covered entity. 3.1.1.1.1.  This  excludes  ARC  medical  personnel  when  not  working  as  part  of  the covered entity. 3.1.2.  Patients  have  certain  rights  (e.g.,  access,  accounting,  alternate  communications, amendment, and restrictions) outlined in the HIPAA Privacy Rule and DoD 6025.18-R.  The MTF is required to retain certain documentation IAW DoD 6025.18-R and paragraph 3.9. of this instruction.  (T-0) 3.1.2.1.  Access  and  fees.    Requests  by  patients  for  access  to  or  copies  of  their  health record must be IAW AFI 41-210, paragraphs 4.3.5.7., 4.4., and, as applicable, this AFI, paragraph 7.6.  (T-0) 3.1.2.2.  Accounting  of  disclosures.    Patient  can  request  an  accounting  of  disclosures.  These  requests  should  be  handled  IAW  DoD  6025.18-R  and  paragraph  3.7.  of  this instruction. 3.1.2.3.  A  patient  can  request  that  the  MTF  communicate  with  them  through alternate/confidential communications. 3.1.2.3.1.  The MTF must accommodate reasonable requests by individuals to receive communications  of  protected  health  information  by  alternate  means  or  at  alternate locations.  (T-0) 3.1.2.4.  Requests for amendment. 3.1.2.4.1.    Any  correction  or  amendment  to  the  health  record  must  be  IAW  DoD 6025.18-R,  Chapter  12,  AFI  41-210,  paragraphs  4.4.8.,  5.3.,  and  the  direction outlined  in  the  “Policy  for  Legal  Correction  of  AHLTA  Erroneous  Data  or Information”  and  process  contained  in  updated  guidance  found  on  AFMOA  Health Information Compliance Team KX website, as applicable.  (T-1) 3.1.2.4.2.  If  the  MTF  HPO  delegates  this  responsibility,  the  MTF  HPO  is  still responsible for oversight and compliance for this process.  (T-1) 14 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 3.1.2.5.  Requests for restrictions must be handled IAW DoD 6025.18-R, C10.1. and AFI 41-210, paragraph 4.4.7.  (T-0) 3.1.2.5.1.  Requests should be submitted to the MTF HPO using the DD Form 2871, Request to Restrict Medical or Dental Information. 3.1.2.5.2.  PHIMT can be used for tracking restrictions that have been granted, using the Accountable Disclosure Restriction functionality. 3.2.  NoPP Requirements.  The AFMS is required to utilize the Military Health System (MHS) NoPP,  which  explains  how  the  patient’s  PHI  may  be  used  and  disclosed.    It  also  describes  the patients’  rights  regarding  the  use  of  PHI  and  contact  information  for  complaints  or  issues.  Deliver  the  NoPP  and  obtain  the  patient’s  acknowledgement  no  later  than  the  date  of  the  first service delivery, or if an emergency treatment situation, as soon as reasonably practicable after the emergency treatment situation (DoD 6025.18-R, Chapter 9.). 3.2.1.  The  MTF  must  make  a  good  faith  attempt  to  obtain  the  patient’s  written acknowledgement of receipt of the NoPP, IAW  DoD 6025.18-R, C9.3.2., C9.5.  (T-0) 3.2.1.1.  MTFs  must  have  a  process  in  place  to  ensure  the  patient  has  acknowledged receipt of the MHS NoPP.  (T-0) 3.2.1.2.  NoPP acknowledgements  must contain each patient’s printed and signed name.  (T-0) 3.2.1.2.1.  Parents, guardians, and loco parentis must be asked to sign acknowledging their receipt of a copy of the NoPP on behalf of the minor child.  (T-0) 3.2.1.3.  If the patient, parent, or guardian declines, or is unable, to acknowledge receipt, the MTF must document the reason why the acknowledgement was not obtained.  (T-0) 3.2.1.4.  See  the  AFMOA  Health  Information  Compliance  Team  KX  website  for information on methodologies for obtaining acknowledgement (e.g., NoPP labels on hard copy  records,    scanning  NoPP  labels  into  HAIMS,  electronic  capture,  or  other  AFMS approved mechanisms). 3.2.2.  Ensure  copies  of  the  MHS  NoPP  pamphlet  are  readily  available  throughout  MTF points  of  service  for  beneficiaries  to  review  and  take  with  them.    (T-0)  Reference  DoD 6025.18-R, C9.3.2.3.2. 3.2.2.1.  Whenever  the  notice  is  revised,  make  the  notice  available  upon  request  on  or after the effective date of the revision. 3.2.3.  The  MTF  must  post  the  MHS  NoPP  in  a  clear  and  prominent  location  where  it  is reasonable  to  expect  individuals  seeking  service  from  the  MTF  will  be  able  to  read  the notice.    Ensure  the  MTF  HPO  contact  information  is  provided  on  the  posting  in  the  lower right corner.  (T-0) 3.2.4.  MTFs that maintain an official website describing customer services or benefits must prominently post the MHS Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP) on the website’s home page IAW with guidance published by DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office (PCLO).  (T-0) 3.3.  Accessing  Information.  The  ability  to  access  PHI  must  be  consistent  with  the  staff member’s role to access the record for treatment, payment, or health care operations.  (T-0) AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 15 3.3.1.  Accessing  PHI  outside  the  scope  of  an  individual’s  job  function  is  not  permissible.  (T-0)  Each situation should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis in order to determine if the individual  had  a  valid  reason  for  obtaining  the  PHI.    HHS  specifically  stated  in  the  25 January  2013,  Federal  Register  that  “access  as  a  result  of  such  snooping  would  be  neither unintentional  nor  done  in  good  faith”  and  would  therefore  be  considered  a  breach.  Impermissibility may include, but is not limited to the following examples. 3.3.1.1.  Looking  up  information  on  self,  co-workers  or  their  family  members,  friends, family members, political figures, or celebrities. 3.3.1.2.  Looking  up  demographic  information  of  a  patient  in  order  to  contact  them outside the work or treatment environment when not in the course of a performing one’s job function (e.g., calling a patient for a social encounter). 3.3.1.3.  Opening  a  document  in  HAIMS  that  has  a  sensitive  or  mental  health  indicator when you are not treating the patient, just to see what is wrong with them. 3.4.  Minimum  Necessary.  Use  or  disclosure,  or  request  for  PHI  is  limited  to  the  minimum amount  of  information  necessary  to  accomplish  the  intended  purpose  of  the  use,  disclosure,  or request  unless  an  exception  to  the  minimum  necessary  rule,  as  outlined  in  DoD  6025.18-R, C8.2.2., applies.  (T-0) 3.4.1.  It  may  be  necessary  to  develop  local  policies/procedures  to  address  minimum standards. 3.4.1.1.  The MTF will need to  evaluate its practices and enhance protections as needed to limit unnecessary or inappropriate access to PHI.  (T-0) 3.4.2.  Disclosures  for  treatment  purposes  between  health  care  providers  are  explicitly exempted from the minimum necessary requirements. 3.4.3.  The MTF should ensure any recipients of the information are authorized to receive the information under the Privacy Act, HIPAA, and any other applicable law or regulation. 3.5.  Incidental disclosures. 3.5.1.  The  MTF  must  implement  reasonable  safeguards  to  limit  incidental  uses  or disclosures.  (T-0)  Reference DoD 6025.18-R, C8.4. 3.5.2.  It  is  not  required  that  all  risk  of  incidental  use  or  disclosure  be  eliminated.    For example: 3.5.2.1.  The  Privacy  Rule  recognizes  that  oral  communications  often  must  occur  freely and quickly in treatment settings. 3.5.2.2.  The  MTF  staff  are  free  to  engage  in  communications  as  required  for  quick, effective, and high quality health care. 3.5.2.3.  Overheard communications in these settings may be unavoidable, but it is a good practice to use lowered voices or talking apart from others when sharing PHI. 3.6.  De-identification.  The  MTF  should  use  de-identified  data  whenever  possible  (e.g., research, aggregate reporting). 16 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 3.6.1.  Health  information  that  has  been  de-identified  under  DoD  6025.18-R,  Chapter  8,  is considered  not  to  be  individually  identifiable  health  information  and  is  not  subject  to  the same restrictions on use/disclosure as PHI.  (T-0) 3.7.  Accounting  of  Disclosures.  A  patient  has  the  right  to  request  an  accounting  of  certain disclosures, except for those disclosures outlined in DoD 6025.18-R, C13.1.1., for the previous 6-year period.  (T-0) 3.7.1.  All  MTFs  will  use  a  standardized  tracking  mechanism  for  accountable  HIPAA disclosures.  (T-1)  PHIMT is the required method to document all accountable disclosures, with the following exceptions. 3.7.1.1.  Aeromedical Services Information Management System (ASIMS) automatically captures disclosures that are made to command authorities.  A separate entry into PHIMT is not required. 3.7.1.1.1.  To request an ASIMS accounting of disclosure report, submit a copy of the patient  request  letter  to  the  AFMOA  HIPAA  team,  who  will  facilitate  with  the ASIMS Program Office. 3.7.1.2.  Disease Reporting System internet (DRSi) captures disclosures that are made to public health authorities within the MHS.  A separate entry into PHIMT is not required. 3.7.1.2.1.  To  request  a  DRSi  accounting  of  disclosure  report,  submit  a  copy  of  the patient request letter to the MTF Public Health clinic, who will be able to provide a copy of the information. 3.7.1.3.  Disease  reporting  made  by  MTF  Public  Health  to  Public  Health  Agencies outside the MHS that have not been documented in DRSi require an entry into PHIMT. 3.7.2.  When a patient  requests an  accounting of  disclosure, the MTF will provide  a  report, consisting  of  PHIMT,  ASIMS,  and  DRSi,  of  the  disclosures  made  during  the  time  period requested  by  the  patient,  for  up  to  6  years  preceding  the  request.    (T-0)    In  addition,  the following  statements  in  paragraph  3.7.2.1,  3.7.2.2,  and  3.7.2.3  must  be  included  with  each response to the patient that is provided by the MTF. 3.7.2.1.  Recurring  Disclosure  to  ARC  Command  Authority.    If  you  are  a  member  of  a Reserve  or  National  Guard  unit  (ARC)  your  Guard  or  Reserve  medical  unit  has  had access to your medical information beginning on the date when you applied for entry to ARC or re-assignment within ARC to a different unit, and thereafter on an ongoing basis, until such time as you are no longer assigned to the particular unit.  Such access was for purposes  of:    determining  your  fitness  for  duty  and  fitness  to  perform  any  particular mission,  assignment,  order,  or  duty;  health  surveillance;  reporting  on  casualties;  or carrying out any other activity necessary to the proper execution of the mission. 3.7.2.2.  Recurring Disclosure for Disability Evaluation System.  If  you have undergone or  are  currently  undergoing  a  disability  review  as  part  of  the  Disability  Evaluation System  (DES),  your  entire  medical,  dental,  and  mental  health  records,  have  been disclosed  by  the  MTF  where  you  receive  the  majority  of  your  care,  or  the  nearest  Air Force  MTF  if  you  were  hospitalized  away  from  your  installation  of  assignment  or  in  a non-Air Force facility, to individuals involved in the DES process.  This includes the pre-screening  process,  AFPC/DP2NP  or  ARC/SGP  review,  Deployment  Availability AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 17 (DAWG),  medical  evaluation  board Working  Group (MEB),  and  Veterans Administration.    Disclosure  of  your  information  occurred  at  the  date  the  referring provider  signed  and  dated  the  VA  Form  21-0819,  VA/DoD  Joint  Disability  Evaluation Board  Claim  form,  and  continued  on  an  ongoing  basis  for  the  duration  of  your involvement in the DES process. 3.7.2.3.  Recurring  Disclosure  for  Fire  Emergency  Services.    If  you  were  provided treatment by an AF ambulance crew (Emergency Medical Services/Technician (EMS/T)) ambulance service,  your medical information contained on the AF Form 552, Air Force Patient Care Report, related to the services you received on the date of the incident was disclosed to the AF Fire Emergency Services (FES), on or about the date you received the service.  FES is required by law to document fire department management, dispatch, data collection  and  fire  incident  reporting  in  the  Fire  Emergency  Services  Information Management  System  (FES-IMS)  as  part  of  the  contingency  planning  process  for  fire safety of personnel and property under the control of installation commanders.  Medical information maintained by AF FES is safeguarded in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974. 3.7.3.  If the MTF elects to use an alternate accounting tool, it must be coordinated through the  AFMOA  HIPAA  team  and  approved  by  the  AFMS  HPO  prior  to  implementation  to ensure  compliance  with  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements.    (T-1)    At  a  minimum,  this data must be centralized, the tool must be able to account for all disclosures made throughout the MTF, and it must conform to all privacy and security safeguards.  (T-1)  All accountable disclosures  must  be  kept  for  a  minimum  of  6  years  IAW  DoD  6025.18-R.    (T-0)    See paragraph 4.3. for additional information on the various categories of disclosures which must be documented. 3.8.  HIPAA  Training  Oversight.  The  MTF  HPO  oversees,  directs,  and  ensures  delivery  of HIPAA privacy/security training and orientation to the MTF workforce, to include trainees and volunteers.  (T-0)  Reference DoD 6025.18-R, C14.2.2. 3.8.1.  Initial  and  Annual  Training.    Joint  Knowledge  Online  (JKO)  is  the  method  for delivering  the  DHA  PCLO  “HIPAA  and  Privacy  Act”  initial  and  annual  refresher  training course.    MTFs  are  required  to  utilize  JKO  for  initial  and  annual  HIPAA  training  to  more effectively track personnel and  completions across the AFMS.  In the event that the training platform  is  changed,  the  AFMS  HPO  will  provide  direction  and  guidance  on  the  future approved mechanism for initial and annual training. 3.8.1.1.  Annual  training  is  conducted  in  order  to  maintain  workforce  awareness  and inform workforce of any changes to privacy policies.  (T-1) 3.8.1.2.  Upon  in-processing  to  the  organization,  employees  that  can  provide  proof  of completion  of  AFMS  approved  HIPAA  training  within  the  previous  12  months,  need only  receive  local  facility  training.    Employees  that  cannot  offer  proof  of  completion must complete both AFMS approved HIPAA training and local facility training within 30 days of assignment or arrival.  (T-2) 3.8.1.3.  The  MTF  HPO  should  periodically  run  reports  to  determine  the  MTFs compliance with training requirements. 18 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 3.8.1.3.1.  Reconciliation  of  JKO  reports  with  personnel  rosters  or  Defense  Medical Human  Resources  System-internet  (DMHRSi)  reports  ensures  that  all  individuals within the facility that require HIPAA training are accurately identified and tracked.  (T-1) the  AFMOA  HIPAA the  AFMS  HPO  prior 3.8.2.  Alternate Training.  MTFs may request use of alternate training in instances where the training  platform  is  determined  to  be  unstable  and  deficiencies  cannot  be  resolved  (e.g., connectivity  issues).    Use  of  alternate  training  and  delivery  methods  must  be  coordinated through to implementation,  to  ensure  compliance  with  initial  training  content  and  documentation requirements.  (T-1)  The AFMS HPO will provide standardized training content for use by those  facilities  that  are  approved  for  alternate  training.    Use  of  commercially  available  or locally  produced  training  content  is  not  authorized  to  meet  core  HIPAA  training requirements. team  and  approved  by 3.8.2.1.  The alternate training content approved by the AFMS HPO is the equivalent of the current HIPAA and Privacy Act course in the learning management application (e.g., JKO).  Completion of this  alternate version meets the HIPAA training requirements for the AFMS. 3.8.2.2.  Organizations  approved  for  use  of  alternate  delivery  methods  must  maintain current  and  accurate  records  of  initial  and  annual  training  of  workforce  members  and provide training statistics to AFMOA HIPAA, upon request.  (T-1) 3.8.2.2.1.  ARC  is  approved  for  use  of  alternate  training  and  delivery  by  the  AFMS HPO.    Training  may  be  accomplished  through  individual  or  group  training  events.  Training completion can be updated in JKO.  Test results must be maintained by the Training Coordinator (TC). 3.8.2.3.  Alternate  training  meets  the  same  requirements  as  are  in  JKO.    Certificates  of Completion are valid throughout the AFMS. 3.8.2.4.  MTFs requesting waiver consideration must submit the following information to AFMOA HIPAA in letter format, endorsed by the MTF Administrator (SGA) or Medical Support Squadron Commander:  (T-1) 3.8.2.4.1.  Identify the nature of the technical difficulties that prevent the MTF from using the platform.  (T-1) 3.8.2.4.2.  Identify  the  specific  actions  that  have  been  taken  to  correct  the  problem (e.g.,  contacting  Base  Communications  or  the  applicable  system  Help  Desk,  and/or user computer configuration attempts).  (T-1) 3.8.2.4.3.  Provide  contact  information  for  local  system  administrator  or  report manager.  (T-2) 3.8.3.  Other audiences. 3.8.3.1.  There may be situations in which an individual is not able to access JKO due to status  as  a  NON-US  CAC  User  (e.g.,  OCONUS)  or  does  not  have  a  CAC  card.    An alternate  public-facing  course  is  available.    Contact  the  AFMOA  HIPAA  team  for guidance and information on how to access the public site. AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 19 3.8.3.1.1.  Trainees  that  complete  this  course  must  save  a  copy  of  their  completion certificate prior to exiting the public-facing course.  No records are maintained on the server  hosting  this  course  and  there  will  be  no  evidence  of  completion  retained  in JKO. 3.8.3.1.2.  Trainees  will need to  provide the  HPO with  a copy of their  Certificate of Completion as proof of successful completion of the course.  (T-2) 3.8.4.  Local  Training.    Ensure  MTF  specific  HIPAA  information  (e.g.,  training  on  local policies,  procedures,  and  awareness  training)  is  briefed  at  MTF  in-processing  sessions, commander’s  calls,  and  other  venues  in  order  to  maintain  workforce  awareness  and  to introduce any changes to privacy policies.  (T-2) 3.8.4.1.  Local privacy training is not a substitute for initial and annual training outlined in paragraph 3.8.1. 3.8.4.2.  For  those  individuals  that  are  not  required  to  complete  HIPAA  training  when their  job  functions  do  not  involve  the  access/use/disclosure  of  PHI  (non-covered functions) (e.g., janitorial/housekeeping staff, maintenance, or logistics personnel), local privacy training can be accomplished. 3.8.4.2.1.  Consult  with  the  AFMOA  HIPAA  team  for  additional  guidance  and requirements for designating categories of individuals that are not subject to HIPAA. 3.8.4.2.2.  Any  local  policies  should  reference  the  categories  of  individuals  that  are exempt from training requirements. 3.8.5.  Other  training.    HIPAA  Privacy  Officer  or  medical  group  leadership  will  make available general HIPAA overview training to new Commanders and First Sergeants within 90 days of assignment using the standardized AFMS briefing template (HIPAA Privacy:  An Overview for Commanders (CC)).  (T-1)  Additional briefings may be provided as needed or upon request of wing leadership. 3.8.5.1.  The  CC  and  Air  Force  Leader  (HIPAA  Privacy:    An  Overview  for  Air  Force Leaders)  briefings  are  the  sole  source  of  HIPAA  privacy  information  presented  at  the commanders’  courses.    The  most  current  versions  are  located  on  the  AFMOA  Health Information  Compliance  Team  KX  website.    Alterations  to  the  CC  and  Air  Force briefings can only be approved by local Medical Group leadership. 3.9.  Document Retention, Destruction, and Disposal. 3.9.1.  Retention.    The  MTF  must  retain  the  documentation  required  IAW  the  HIPAA Compliance  Documentation  outlined in  the  Air  Force  Records  Disposition  Schedule  (RDS) located in the Air Force Records Information Management System (AFRIMS).  (T-0) 3.9.1.1.  Maintain the policies and procedures provided in written or electronic form; (T-0) 3.9.1.2.  If  a  communication  is  required  to  be  in  writing,  maintain  the  writing  and  any response, or an electronic copy, including  names/titles of persons or offices responsible for receiving and processing requests, as documentation; and (T-0) 3.9.1.3.  If  an  action,  activity,  or  designation  is  required  to  be  documented,  maintain  a written or electronic record of such action, activity, or designation.  (T-0) 20 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 3.9.2.  Destruction.    In  the  event  that  any  documents  requiring  retention  or  documents containing  PHI  have  reached  their  applicable  expiration,  the  documents  must  be  properly destroyed  and  disposed  of  by  rendering  records  or  data  unusable,  unreadable,  or indecipherable.  (T-0) 3.9.3.  Disposal.  Documents  or electronic systems/devices, including  computers, copiers or fax machines with memory storage, or other electronic storage devices that may contain PHI must be disposed  IAW  Air Force Manual  (AFMAN) 33-363, Management  of Records,  and Air Force RDS located in the AFRIMS.  (T-1) 3.9.3.1.  The  memory  contained  in  these  devices  must  be  swiped  or  cleared  before disposition.  (T-0) 3.9.3.2.  PHI  in  paper  format  should  be  immediately  shredded.    If  the  PHI  cannot  be immediately shredded, it will be placed in a locked, secure area until it can be destroyed.  (T-0)  PHI must not be disposed of in the regular garbage or recycle bins.  (T-0) 3.9.3.3.  Periodic  checks  of  garbage  cans,  recycle  bins,  or  dumpsters  can  be  made  to ensure that PHI is being properly disposed of. 3.10.  Removal of PHI from the Facility. 3.10.1.  In general, PHI should not be removed from the MTF for use off-site. 3.10.2.  If  there  are  particular  circumstances  in  which  treatment,  payment,  or  health  care operations  cannot  be  performed  without  removing  PHI  from  the  facility  by  a  workforce member, the MTF must develop and implement procedures to reasonably protect the physical integrity, security, and confidentiality of the PHI while off-site (e.g., teleworking).  (T-0) 3.10.2.1.  Use  of  mobile  devices  (e.g.,  laptops,  tablets)  must  comply  with  relevant Federal, DOD issuances, and Air Force instructions. 3.10.2.2.  Any  paper  documents/records  must  be  secured  when  not  in  use  and  must  be returned to the facility as soon as is reasonably practical. 3.10.3.  The  procedures  must  ensure  that  removal  of  the  PHI  from  the  MTF  is  for  an appropriate use and has been approved by the individual’s supervisor. 3.10.4.  Any damage to, loss of, or unauthorized access to the PHI must be promptly reported to the MTF and MTF HPO. 3.10.4.1.  Examples of loss might include theft from a vehicle or missing, lost baggage at airport or other public transportation. 3.11.  Storage  of  Electronic  Documents  Containing  PHI.  Excepting  the  limitations  for Alternative  Methods  to  Capture  Consults  and  Referral  Results  storage,  IAW  AFI  41-210, paragraph 5.4.9.8.3., other electronic documents containing PHI that require retention, pursuant to document retention requirements in DoD 6025.18-R, C14.10., may be stored on shared drives or  SharePoint  locations  (e.g.,  complaint  investigations,  patient  correspondence,  congressional inquiries). 3.11.1.  All MTF computer folders and files containing PHI must be limited to users who can demonstrate a verifiable need for access.  (T-0) AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 21 3.11.2.  All computer folders and files containing PHI must offer limited user access and be either password protected or hidden with access restriction requirements.  (T-1) 3.11.3.  Data at rest solutions may be deployed to encrypt files and folders containing PHI. 3.11.4.  When no longer needed for daily operations or record retention, remove PHI which is  accessible  or  viewed  through  shared  drives,  SharePoint  or  similar  web  base  applications IAW paragraph 3.9.  (T-1) 22 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 Chapter 4 USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PHI 4.1.  Uses and Disclosures for Which an Authorization is Required. 4.1.1.  When patient authorization is required, obtain written authorization from the patient or his/her legal representative before releasing information from the health record to any person or  agency.      The  DD  Form  2870,  Authorization  for  Disclosure  of  Medical  or  Dental Information, should be used for this purpose. 4.1.1.1.  If  a  personal  representative  of  the  individual  signs  the  authorization,  a description  of,  or  legal  documentation  representing,  the  representative's  authority  to  act for the individual shall be provided for review, such as Power of Attorney, Guardianship, etc.  (T-0)  The individual’s identity must also be verified in the process.  (T-0) 4.1.1.1.1.  For un-emancipated minors or physically or mentally challenged persons, a personal  representative signs the written authorization and, if applicable, furnishes a copy of the court order appointing guardianship. 4.1.1.1.2.  MTFs should coordinate with their Medical Law Consultant (MLC) and/or Staff  Judge  Advocate  (SJA)  to  identify  specific  State  requirements  and  incorporate these requirements into MTF policies and procedures for the treatment of minors and confidentiality in situations when  a minor can consent  to  treatment  without  parental notification  as  set  forth  in  AFI  44-102,  Medical  Care  Management.    While  the  law varies  from  state  to  state,  examples  of  these  issues  may  include  birth  control, abortion,  treatment  of  sexually  transmitted  infections  (STI),  substance  abuse treatment, etc. 4.1.2.  For deceased persons, if there is a need for an authorization before releasing PHI, the decedent's  legal  personal  representative  signs  the  authorization.    The  status  of  personal representative  is  normally  determined  by  the  laws  of  the  jurisdiction  where  the  records  are held.  Consult with MLC or SJA to determine the requirements for personal representatives. 4.1.2.1.  HIPAA  applies  to  health  records  of  a  deceased  individual  for  a  period  of  50 years following the death of the individual, if the entity retains the record for that period of time.  (T-0)  Reference 45 CFR §164.502(f). 4.1.2.2.  This does not mean that the entity is required to retain the record for the 50-year period. 4.1.2.3.  Record retention requirements are outlined in AFRIMS RDS. 4.1.3.  Maintain  the  signed  authorization  with  a  notation  of  the  disclosed  information,  date received/disclosed,  and  identity  of  the  employee  making  the  disclosure  by  uploading  a scanned copy to PHIMT (or other AFMS approved applications).  (T-0) 4.1.3.1.  If  the  PHIMT  authorization  functionality  is  not  available,  file  the  authorization in the patient’s health record. 4.1.4.  If  litigation  is  pending  or  contemplated,  send  the  request  for  release  to  the  MLC  or SJA for advice and appropriate action in accordance with AFI 51-301, Civil Litigation.  (T-1) AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 23 4.1.5.  Accepting  Third  Party  Authorizations.    Third  party  (e.g.,  Insurance  Agencies, Worker's Compensation) authorization forms can be accepted if they meet the data elements listed in DoD 6025.18-R, C5.3., and include the name or organization authorized to make the disclosure (the MTF), the name or organization to whom the MTF is making the disclosure (the third party), the purpose of the disclosure, an expiration date or an expiration event, the signature of the individual, and signature date. 4.1.6.  Release  of  health  records  must  not  occur  if  an  authorization  is  determined  to  be invalid under the elements outlined in DoD 6025.18-R.  (T-0) 4.1.6.1.  Some  common  reasons  authorizations  are  invalid  are:    missing  core  elements, not  completed  or  signed,  or  legal  representative  documents  not  included,  when applicable. 4.1.7.  Other considerations. 4.1.7.1.  Authorization for Psychotherapy  Notes.  An MTF must obtain an authorization for  any  use  or  disclosure  of  psychotherapy  notes,  except  to  carry  out  the  following:  treatment, payment, or health care operations.  (T-0) 4.1.7.1.1.  Consult with the MLC/SJA for requests received for psychotherapy notes.  (T-2) 4.1.7.2.  Authorization for Marketing.  An MTF must obtain an authorization for any use or disclosure of PHI for  making a marketing  communication about  a product  or service that  encourages  recipients  of  the  communication  to  purchase  or  use  the  product  or service.  (T-0) 4.1.7.2.1.  It  is  highly  unlikely  that  an  MTF  will  engage  in  these  types  of communications contemplated under HIPAA. 4.1.7.2.2.  Consult  with  AFMOA  HIPAA  for  additional  guidance  relating  to exceptions to the marketing restrictions and financial remuneration. 4.2.  Uses and Disclosures Requiring an Opportunity for the Patient to Agree or Object.   4.2.1.  Facility Directory.  If the patient has been given the opportunity to agree or object to being  in  the  facility  directory,  and  has  not  objected,  the  following  information  may  be released to those who ask for the individual by name:  Individual’s location in the facility; the patient’s  condition  described  in  general  terms  that  does  not  communicate  specific  medical information  about  the  individual  (using  descriptions  such  as:  stable,  good,  fair,  serious, critical, conscious, semiconscious, and unconscious); and the individual’s religious affiliation to the clergy.  (T-0)  Reference DoD 6025.18-R, C6.1.. 4.2.1.1.  The  following  information  should  not  be  released  in  the  facility  directory:  marital status (e.g., divorced, single, widowed); base, installation, station, or organization of routinely deployable or sensitive units; description of disease or injury; general factual circumstances; and general extent of the injury or disease.  (T-1)  Do not specify location or description that may prove embarrassing to the individual or reflect bad taste.  (T-1) 4.2.1.2.  NEVER  release  a  prognosis  or  sensitive  medical  information  relating  to  the admission  of  the  patient,  including  but  not  limited  to,  sexual  assault,  criminal  actions, drug  or  alcohol  abuse,  psychiatric  or  social  conditions,  STI,  or  Acquired 24 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 Immunodeficiency  Syndrome  (AIDS)  –  HIV  (Human  Immunodeficiency  Virus)  data  or AIDS related syndrome.  (T-1) 4.2.2.  Do not release information listed in paragraph 4.2.1.1. if the patient is not conscious or is mentally incompetent.  (T-0)  If the patient is under age or incompetent, the guardian, or legal representative may make the decision. 4.2.3.  Disclosures  for  involvement  in  the  individual’s  care  and  notification  purposes.    An MTF  may  disclose  to  a  family  member,  other  relative,  or  a  close  personal  friend  of  the individual, or any other person identified by the individual, the PHI directly relevant to such person’s involvement with the individual’s care or payment related to the individual’s health care. 4.2.3.1.  The  MTF  may  use  or  disclose  PHI  to  notify,  or  assist  in  the  notification  of (including  identifying  or  locating),  a  family  member,  a  personal  representative  of  the individual, or another person responsible for the care of the individual of the individual’s location,  general  condition,  or  death.    Any  such  use  or  disclosure  of  PHI  for  such notification purposes must be in accordance with DoD 6025.18-R, C6.2., as applicable. 4.2.4.  Providing Medical Information or Patient Status Information to the Public (Including News  Media).    Disclosure  of  medical  information  to  the  public  is  extremely  limited  under both HIPAA and the Privacy Act.  If requested by a news media agency or upon receiving a general  public  inquiry,  the  Privacy  Act  only  permits  the  release  information  that  does  not constitute  an  invasion  of  personal  privacy.  If  appropriate,  notify  the  patient’s  personal representative  and  obtain  authorization  before  releasing  information  through  the  Public Affairs Office to the news media or to the public.  Contact the MTF HIPAA Privacy Officer before releasing information regarding a patient’s status.  Never release a patient’s diagnosis or prognosis without patient consent.  If the HIPAA Privacy Officer is not available, consult the MLC or SJA prior to disclosing or providing any medical or patient status information. 4.3.  Uses and Disclosures for Which an Authorization or Opportunity to Agree or Object is  not  Required.  Most  disclosures  made  that  are  not  for  treatment,  payment  or  healthcare operations, or pursuant to the patient’s authorization must be tracked in PHIMT or other tracking tool  approved  by  the  AFMS  HPO.    (T-0)    A  record  of  disclosures  will  be  maintained  for  six years.  (T-0)  Account for disclosures IAW paragraph 3.7. for any of the disclosures listed, unless otherwise  specified,  and  consistent  with  DoD  6025.18-R.    (T-0)    This  section  provides  a  basic description  of  permissible  disclosures.    For  a  complete  review  of  each  standard,  refer  to  DoD 6025.18-R,  Chapter  7.    Included  with  the  basic  descriptions  below  are  additional  Air  Force requirements. 4.3.1.  Required  by  law.    The  MTF  may  use  or  disclose  PHI  to  the  extent  that  such  use  or disclosure  is  required  by  law  and  the  use  or  disclosure  complies  with  and  is  limited  to  the relevant requirements of such law.  Refer to DoD 6025.18-R, C7.1. 4.3.2.  Public  Health  Activities.    The  MTF  may  disclose  PHI  for  certain  public  health activities under specified circumstances outlined in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.2. 4.3.2.1.  Among  the  permissible  public  health  disclosures,  the  MTF  may  disclose immunization records to a school, IAW 45 CFR §164.512(b)(1)(vi), about an individual who is a student or prospective student of the school, only if: AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 25 4.3.2.1.1.  The  MTF  obtains  a  verbal  or  written  agreement  to  the  disclosure  from either  parent/guardian/other  person  acting  in  loco  parentis  or  adult/emancipated minor; 4.3.2.1.2.  The MTF must document the agreement to the disclosure; (T-0) 4.3.2.1.3.  The PHI that is disclosed is limited to proof of immunization; and 4.3.2.1.4.  The  school  is  required  by  State  or  other  law  to  have  such  proof  of immunization prior to admitting the individual. 4.3.2.1.5.  Written agreement does not need to be in the form of a HIPAA compliant authorization. 4.3.3.  Victims of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.  An MTF may disclose PHI about an individual whom the MTF reasonably believes to be a victim of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence to a government authority, including a social service or protective services agency, authorized by law to  receive reports of such  abuse, neglect,  or domestic  violence under the circumstances specified in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.3. 4.3.3.1.  In situations involving restricted reporting,  follow restricted reporting  guidance provided  in  DoDI  6495.02,  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  Program Procedures  (SAPR),  AFI  90-6001,  Sexual  Assault  Prevention  and  Response  (SAPR) Program,  and  AFI  40-301,  Family  Advocacy  Program,  to  include  intimate  partner maltreatment. 4.3.4.  Health Oversight Activities.  The MTF may disclose PHI to specified health oversight agencies  for specified oversight activities as outlined in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.4. 4.3.5.  Judicial or Administrative Proceedings.  The MTF may disclose PHI in the course of a judicial  or  administrative  proceeding    if  the  requirements  outlined  in  DoD  6025.18-R, paragraph C7.5. have been met. 4.3.5.1.  Consult  with  MLC or SJA for advice or action when the disclosure of medical information is for pending litigation. 4.3.5.2.  If  the  request  is  accompanied  by  a  signed  HIPAA  authorization,  an  accounting of the disclosure is not required.  In any other circumstances, account for the disclosure. 4.3.6.  Law Enforcement Agency  Inquires.  Refer to  DoD 6025.18-R, C7.6., for a complete review of standards for compliance. 4.3.6.1.  Upon approval of the MTF Commander and with MLC or SJA concurrence that the  requirements  set  forth  in  DoD  6025.18-R,  paragraph  C7.6.,  have  been  met,  provide requested  or  subpoenaed  PHI  to  law  enforcement  agencies  conducting  official investigations.    Provide  either  supervised  access  to  health  record(s)  or  certified  copies only.  (T-2)  Law enforcement agency inquires will be processed by the HIPAA Privacy Officer.  (T-1) 4.3.6.1.1.  A  sample  “Investigative  Agency  Request  for  Health  Information” (“Investigative  Agency  Request”)  letter  can  be  found  on  the  AFMOA  Health Information Compliance Team KX. 26 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 4.3.6.1.2.  The  Release  of  Information  (ROI)  department  will  keep  a  copy  of  all investigative  agency  requests.    (T-0)    Obtain  a  signed  receipt  for  any  material  or document/record copies (copied by the agent or by MTF staff) furnished to the agent.  Note:  Do  not  file  the  statement  or  document  receipt  in  the  patient’s  health  record.  Maintain the statement in a separate folder in the general correspondence file until the investigation is concluded. 4.3.7.  About decedents.  Refer to DoD 6025.18-R, C7.7., for a complete review of standards for disclosures related to decedents. 4.3.8.  For  cadaveric organ, eye or tissue donation purposes.   An MTF may  use or disclose PHI  under  specified  circumstances  to  facilitate  organ,  eye  or  tissue  donation  and transportation IAW DoD 6025.18-R, C7.8. 4.3.9.  Research Purposes Involving Minimal Risk.  Follow the procedures in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.9., for releasing PHI for research involving minimal risk.  (T-0) 4.3.9.1.  MTFs  can  release  information  that  is  properly  de-identified  without  patient authorization and without tracking the disclosure. 4.3.10.  To avert a serious threat to health or safety.  An MTF may, consistent with applicable law and standards of ethical conduct, use or disclose PHI, if the MTF, in good faith, believes the  use  or  disclosure  is  necessary  to  prevent  or  lessen  a  serious  and  imminent  threat  to  the health  or  safety  of  a  person  or  the  public  and  is  to  a  person  or  persons  reasonably  able  to prevent  or lessen the threat,  including the target  of the threat,  or under other circumstances specified in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.10. 4.3.11.  Specialized  Government  Functions.    DoD  6025.18-R,  paragraphs  C7.11.1.  through C7.11.7.  detail  circumstances  under  which  a  MTF  can  use  or  disclose  PHI  for  specified specialized government functions. 4.3.11.1.  If the MTF discloses to a correctional institution or a law enforcement official having  lawful  custody  of  an  inmate  or  other  individual  PHI  about  such  inmate  or individual for the purposes outlined in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.11.6.: 4.3.11.1.1.  Do  not  give  the  First  Sergeant  or  prisoner  escort  the  original  health records of service members. 4.3.11.1.2.  No accounting or tracking is required for these disclosures. 4.3.12.  Workers’  Compensation.    An  MTF  may  disclose  protected  health  information  as authorized  by  and  to  the  extent  necessary  to  comply  with  laws  relating  to  workers’ compensation or other similar programs, established by law, that provide benefits for work-related injuries or illness without regard to fault.  (T-0)  Reference DoD 6025.18-R, C7.12. 4.3.12.1.  Any requests identified as a potential third party liability case must be recorded on  an  AF  Form  1488,  Daily  Log  of  Patients  Treated  for  Injuries.    (T-1)    This  includes requests  received  from  an  attorney,  workers’  compensation  appeals  board,  or  an insurance  company  in  a  case  involving  work-related  injury  or  disease.    Forward  these requests to the clinic where the patient was seen. The clinic will complete the AF Form 1488 and forward the AF Form 1488 to the Resource Management Office.  (T-1) AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 27 Chapter 5 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR USE AND DISCLOSURE OF PHI 5.1.  Command  Authorities.  Under  certain  conditions,  HIPAA  permits  the  MTF  to  use  and disclose  the  PHI  of  Armed  Forces  personnel  for  activities  deemed  necessary  by  appropriate military  command  authorities  to  assure  the  proper  execution  of  the  military  mission.    Refer  to DoD 6025.18-R, C7.11., for a full description of uses and disclosures for specialized government functions.  (T-0) 5.1.1.  Disclosures to  Commanders/Civilian Directors/Designees.   Disclosures are permitted when  necessary  for  the  Commander  to  make  a  determination  of  the  individual’s  fitness  for duty,  fitness  to  perform  any  particular  mission/assignment/order/duty,  joint  medical surveillance,  reporting  casualties,  to  carry  out  any  other  activity  necessary  to  the  proper execution of the mission, or related to insider threats (paragraph 4.3.11.).  Authorization by the  individual  or  the  opportunity  to  agree  or  object  to  the  disclosure  is  not  required.  “Commander”  collectively  refers  to  Commanders  and  Civilian  Directors.    See  AFI  51-604, Appointment to and Assumption of Command.  As referenced in AFI 51-604, Figure A2.1., a civilian director can receive PHI  as needed to  carry out   specific  authorities (e.g., initiating enlisted discharge  actions, initiating  Line of Duty  Determinations (LODs), directing mental health  evaluations  (MHEs),  signing  profiles,  taking  PRAP  actions,  suspending  clearances, investigating  unauthorized  absences,  etc.)  without  the  need  for  a  delegation  letter.    For activities not listed, consult the servicing legal office. 5.1.1.1.  Disclosures  pursuant  to  this  paragraph  5.1.  must  be  accounted  for  IAW paragraph 3.7. (T-0), unless an exception applies pursuant to DoD 6025.18-R, Chapter 7. 5.1.1.1.1.  Disclosures  of  information  of  members  of  the  Armed  Forces  to  a Commander or designee through ASIMS are  automatically  captured within  ASIMS.  If, however, the disclosure to the Commander or designee is made outside of ASIMS and  includes  additional  information  from  what  the  Commander  or  designee  would have  access  to  in  ASIMS,  then  documentation  in  PHIMT  would  be  required  IAW paragraph 3.7. 5.1.1.1.2.  If the patient is a National Guard or Reserve member, or applicant, release PHI to Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard medical personnel when required to determine the member’s medical qualification for continued military duty. 5.1.1.2.  Access,  however,  must  be  balanced  with  the  recognized  sensitivity  of  health records, which often contain information of a very private nature (e.g., Alcohol and Drug Abuse  Programs,  HIV/AIDS  status,  mental  health).    (T-2)    In  addition,  other  laws  or regulations may further restrict the Commander’s access to, or use of, a service member’s health information.  Therefore, before a Commander or his/her designee gains access to an individual’s PHI, in excess of what is available in ASIMS, he or she must establish the information  is  required  for  mission-related  purposes  IAW  DoD  6025.18-R,  C7.11.  and DoDI  6490.08,  Command  Notification  Requirements  to  Dispel  Stigma  in  Providing Mental Health Care to Service Members, and the use or disclosure must not be otherwise restricted by law or regulation.  (T-1) 28 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 5.1.1.2.1.  In instances where the MTF is uncertain if the Commander or designee has established  a  need  for  the  information  the  MTF  HPO  shall  seek  the  advice  of  the servicing MLC or SJA.  (T-2) 5.1.1.2.2.  Disclosure  of  PHI  should  be  released  IAW  the  minimum  amount  of information  necessary  to  accomplish  the  task  as  defined  in  DoD  6025.18-R.  However,  the  MTF  must  take  into  consideration  that  the  amount  of  information necessary must be sufficient to permit the Commander to make informed decisions. 5.1.1.2.2.1.  If  a  provider  communicates  (i.e.,  verbal  or  written)  with  a Commander  regarding  a  service  member’s  profile  and  discloses  any  additional medical information than what would be released via ASIMS documentation, the additional  information  disclosed  during  the  conversation  must  be  manually tracked in PHIMT.  (T-1) 5.1.1.2.2.2.  This  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  disclosures  to  Commanders  for confirming attendance to medical appointments or sending appointment no-show letters. 5.1.1.2.3.  Access to the original record should not ordinarily be provided, but will be provided if there is a clear need.  The requester shall document in writing to the MTF Commander  the  need  for  access  to  the  original  record  and  why  a  summary  is  not sufficient.    The  MTF  may  make  a  provider  available  to  assist  the  requester  in interpreting the health record. 5.1.1.3.  Commanders must be cognizant of their role, especially when they are serving in the  capacity  of  a  practicing  clinician.    The  amount  of  information  a  practicing  clinician may come in contact with, in the course of treating patients, is different than the amount of  information  a  Commander,  as  the  command  authority,  could  receive  for  specialized government functions. 5.1.1.4.  Once  health  information  is  disclosed  to  command  authorities,  it  is  no  longer subject to HIPAA because the Commander is not a HIPAA covered entity.  However, it remains  subject  to  the  Privacy  Act  since  it  was  derived  from  a  Privacy  Act  system  of records.    Additionally,  there  may  be  other  legal  protections  that  impact  releasability  of the health information. 5.1.1.5.  The  HIPAA  Privacy  Rule  permits,  but  does  not  compel,  the  sharing  of  health information  between  an  external  civilian  provider  and  authorized  command  authorities. The  military  has  no  recourse  under  HIPAA  for  obtaining  information  if  the  civilian provider  declines  to  release  the  information  without  the  individual’s  authorization.  However,  AFI  48-123,  Medical  Examinations  and  Standards,  paragraph  2.12.  requires military  members  to  report  and  submit  all  medical  and  dental  treatment  from  civilian sources to their Primary Care Manager (PCM). 5.1.2.  Commander  Designee  Process.  Verification  of  identity  is  required  before  releasing PHI  to  appropriate  military  command  authorities  or  their  respective  designee  under  the provisions of DoD 6025.18-R.  (T-0)  The MTF must ensure the individual to whom the PHI pertains is under the command authority of the requestor, and that the information requested pertains to the military mission, fitness for duty, or other permissible disclosure.  (T-0) AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 29 5.1.2.1.  Personnel permanently assigned to the position of Deputy/Vice Commander and First  Sergeant  are  designated  as  commander  designees  by  virtue  of  their  position.  Commanders,  Deputy/Vice  Commanders,  and  First  Sergeants  do  not  require  an appointment  letter.    Individuals  filling  these  positions  on  a  temporary  or  interim  basis must be appointed in writing. 5.1.2.2.  Commanders  will  designate  in  writing,  by  position  or  name,  any  additional personnel that are authorized to act on their behalf to receive PHI for assigned squadron personnel.  (T-1) 5.1.2.3.  ARC Medical Unit Commanders will work in conjunction with the various ARC Line  Commander’s  to  ensure  that  ARC  personnel,  designated  IAW  paragraph  5.2.,  are part of the ARC Line Commander designee process, having authority to access PHI of an individual who is a member of the Armed Forces in order to perform activities outlined in DoD 6025.18-R, C7.11.1.3.  (T-1) 5.1.2.4.  There  are  limited  circumstances  in  which  disclosures  of  PHI  are  necessary  for the  purpose  of  a  Command  Directed  Evaluation  (CDE),  ordered  by  a  Commander  or  a Supervisor.    Refer  to  DoDI  6490.04,  Mental  Health  Evaluations  for  Members  of  the Military Services and AFI 44-172, Mental Health, for additional information. 5.1.2.4.1.  Regardless  of  who  requests  an  emergency  CDE  (e.g.,    Senior  Enlisted member),  the  results  will  be  disclosed  only  to  the  Commander,  Commander’s designee, or Supervisor requesting the CDE (as defined by DoDI 6490.04).  (T-1) 5.1.3.  The  MTF  HPO  will  establish  procedures  for  periodically  communicating  with  local units  supported  by  the  MTF  to  ensure  current  designee  listings  from  each  unit  have  been submitted  and  are  available  to  MTF  work  centers  for  use  in  verifying  the  identity  of Commanders  and  their  respective  designees  for  routine  disclosures  of  PHI  such  as appointment rosters, ASIMS Web reports, and quarters notifications.  (T-2) 5.1.4.  Local units are responsible for submitting the appointment letter to the MTF HPO and ASIMS Coordinator whenever there is a change of Commanders or designees.  (T-1) 5.2.  ARC Access.  ARC access is understood to be multiple disclosures of PHI to the command authority for a single purpose. 5.2.1.  The  host  MTF  or  National  Guard  Bureau  (NGB)/SG  Office  for  ANG  will  provide access to health records systems (AHLTA, Composite Health Care System (CHCS), HAIMS, etc.),  and  where  applicable,  SG  approved  access  mechanisms  (AVHE/successor  system(s), Citrix, etc.) to ARC medical personnel.  (T-1)  Such ARC SG providers’ access to PHI in a health  records  system  is  subject  to  the  terms  and  conditions  of  access  applicable  to  the system for which access is required.  Access to the patient’s medical information will be for a HIPAA-compliant purpose and will be accounted for IAW paragraph 3.7.2.  (T-0) 5.2.2.  The  ARC  Medical  Unit  Commander  must  designate  in  writing  and  maintain  such designation  of  ARC  members  (ARC  Access  List)  who  are  medical  personnel  to  access, receive, use or disclose PHI of an individual under an ARC Commander’s authority for the purposes outlined in the Chapter 7 of the DoD 6025.18-R.  (T-1) 5.2.2.1.  Once  information  is  in  the  possession  of  the  ARC  Medical  Unit  outside  of AHLTA, the information is no longer subject to HIPAA because the ARC Medical Unit 30 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 is  not  a  HIPAA  covered  entity  and  is  not  acting  as  a  business  associate.    However,  the information  does  remain  subject  to  the  Privacy  Act.    Remember,  ARC  access  to  the information in AHLTA must be for a HIPAA-compliant purpose. 5.2.3.  Completion  of  AHLTA  system  training  at  any  MTF  is  valid  for  ARC  medical personnel regardless of assigned location. 5.3.  Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) and Mission-Related Medical Communications. 5.3.1.  ASIMS is the authorized system for IMR tracking. 5.3.2.  ASIMS automatically accounts for disclosures to command authorities in its database and does not require manual entry of the disclosure information. 5.3.3.  ASIMS  includes  an  auto-generated  communication  mechanism  that  contains  a Common Access Card (CAC) authenticated link to the member’s MyIMR page that contains more detailed information about IMR requirements and need for an appointment.  PHI is not contained in the initial communication to the member. 5.4.  For  Release  of  Information  for  Personnel  Reliability  Assurance  Program  (PRAP) Purposes. 5.4.1.  Each  disclosure  of  the  patient’s  medical  information  for  PRAP  purposes  must  be accounted for using one of the mechanisms outlined below: 5.4.1.1.  PHIMT; or 5.4.1.2.  DD Form 2870 (Authorization for Disclosure of Medical or Dental Information. 5.4.2.  The PRP Administrative Qualification Central Cell (AQCC) workflow are part of the AFMS  covered  entity  and  are  required  to  comply  with  HIPAA,  including  accounting  for disclosures to the Certifying Official (CO) or Reviewing Official (RO). 5.4.3.  Once information is in the possession of the CO or RO, the information is no longer subject to HIPAA because the CO or RO is not a HIPAA covered entity and is not acting as a business associate.  However, the information does remain subject to the Privacy Act. 5.5.  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  (OSHA).  For  additional  information relating  to  occupational  health,  refer  to  AFI  48-145,  Occupational  and  Environmental  Health Program, and AFMAN 48-146, Occupational & Environmental Health Program Management. AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 31 Chapter 6 COMPLAINTS & INVESTIGATIONS 6.1.  Complaints. 6.1.1.  Leadership  of  all  organizations  within the administrative,  technical,  and  physical  requirements  described  in  HIPAA  Privacy  Rule, including reporting, investigating, and mitigating breaches.  (T-0) the  AFMS  must  comply  with 6.1.2.  Breaches under the Privacy Act involving non-medical PII (e.g., a unit alpha roster or information  from  an  individual’s  personnel  file)  must  be  properly  reported  through  the Installation  Privacy  Office  for  their  handling  and  investigation,  but  do  not  require coordination  through  the  AFMS  HIPAA  team.    (T-0)    Reference  DoD  5400.11-R,  C1.5.1, C10.6.1. 6.1.3.  MTFs  must  establish  a  standard  procedure  to  receive  and  investigate  HIPAA-related complaints  and  allegations  of  non-compliance.    (T-0)    The  MTF  may  elect  to  use  existing Patient  Advocate  services  as  a  focal  point  for  receiving  complaints,  or  refer  individuals directly to the MTF HPO. 6.1.4.  The MTF HPO will normally investigate all HIPAA-related complaints and prepare a written report of the investigation.  (T-1) 6.2.  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) inquiries.  These are high-visibility, time  sensitive  issues.    Complaints  received  by  HHS  are  forwarded  to  the  DHA  PCLO  for dissemination to the appropriate service-level Privacy Officer.  (T-1) 6.2.1.  Procedures for processing HHS inquiries. 6.2.1.1.  Upon  receiving  a  notification  of  inquiry  the  AFMS  HPO  will  prepare  a  cover letter to inform AFMOA HIPAA of the inquiry; the letter will include guidance regarding investigation and documentation requirements, and establish a suspense date for returning the completed investigation to AFMS HPO.  The cover letter will be packaged with the HHS inquiry and forwarded to the AFMOA HIPAA team for processing. AFMS HIPAA team will maintain a log of all HHS inquiry actions and responses.  (T-1) 6.2.1.2.  The  AFMOA  HIPAA  team  will  forward  the  cover  letter  and  inquiry documentation  to  the  appropriate  MTF.    Additionally,  the  team  will  provide  SME assistance to MTF personnel as necessary in conducting the investigation and in ensuring a comprehensive response is prepared for submission to HHS. 6.2.1.3.  Once  completed,  the  MTF  response  and  all  required  documentation  will  be submitted to the AFMOA HIPAA team for quality review and submission to the AFMS HPO.    (T-1)    The  AFMS  HPO  will  review  and  approve  the  report,  then  submit  to  the DHA PCLO for review and final processing. 6.2.2.  The  MTF  HPO  must  immediately  notify  AFMOA  HIPAA  in  the  event  an  HHS inquiry bypasses the normal routing chain and is received directly at MTF-level.  (T-1)  The AFMOA HIPAA team will ensure appropriate tracking and response procedures are initiated as  described  above;  MTFs  are  not  permitted  to  respond  directly  to  HHS  Field Representatives. 32 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 6.3.  Identification. 6.3.1.  Workforce  members  that  become  aware  of  an  actual  or  possible  loss  of  control, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access to PII or PHI, in verbal, paper, or electronic form,  must  immediately  report  the  circumstances  of  the  event  to  the  organization‘s BRC/HPO.  (T-0) 6.3.2.  Upon  being  notified  of  a  potential  or  actual  breach,  the  BRC/HPO  will  evaluate  the preliminary  facts  to  determine  if  an  actual  or  possible  loss  of  control,  unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access to PII or PHI has occurred.  (T-1) 6.3.2.1.  Based  on  this  initial  assessment,  the  BRC/HPO  will  either  document  the  basis for  determining  no  breach  has  occurred  and  take  no  further  action,  or  initiate  an investigation, including breach response procedures, as applicable.  (T-0)  Note that not all incidents meet the definition of a breach under HIPAA. 6.3.3.  The MTF HPO will ensure that the breach timelines, determinations, and notifications are made IAW paragraph 6.4.1. and the “Breach Timeline & Notification” flow chart.  (T-1)  The flow chart is located on the AFMOA Health Information Compliance Team KX website and provides a process flow to ensure that requirements under HIPAA are accomplished. 6.3.4.  Assigning investigators and their authority. 6.3.4.1.  In cases where the MTF Commander appoints an investigating officer (IO), the MTF HPO will serve as SME to the investigator.  (T-1) 6.3.4.2.  If the complaint involves the actions of the MTF HPO or a disclosure where the individual received the advice of the MTF HPO, the MTF Commander shall appoint an IO.    (T-1)    In  these  cases,  the  MLC/SJA  or  the  AFMOA  HIPAA  SMEs  can  provide subject matter expertise to the IO. 6.3.4.2.1.  If  the  complaint  involves  the  actions  of  the  MTF  Commander,  the MAJCOM will appoint an IO. 6.3.5.  For  complaints  involving  e-PHI,  the  MTF  HPO  will  collaborate  with  the  HSO  to ensure an integrated review of the incident.  (T-1) 6.4.  Investigation. 6.4.1.  Reporting  Timeline.    FIRST,  CONTACT  AFMOA  HIPAA  IMMEDIATELY  FOR GUIDANCE  BEFORE  FILING  A  US-CERT.    The  time  requirements  for  breach  reporting and mitigation begin at the time the breach is discovered or becomes known, IAW HIPAA.  Located  on  the  AFMOA  Health  Information  Compliance  Team  KX  website  is  the  Breach Timeline & Notification flow chart that graphically demonstrates the activities that occur at various stages of the breach determination (discovery through the first hour, first hour to the end  of  the  first  day,  second  through  the  notification  requirement  within  ten  days,  HIPAA Risk Assessment, and media notifications).  Reference  DoD 5400.11-R, C1.5.1.2. 6.4.1.1.  Within ONE HOUR from the breach becoming known. 6.4.1.1.1.  Initial notification actions and associated reporting activities occur in rapid sequence, and in some circumstances may occur simultaneously. The BRC/HPO will: AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 33 the HIPAA team 6.4.1.1.2.  Notify atusaf.jbsa.afmoa.mbx.hipaa@mail.mil, respective  AFMOA  HIPAA representative, AND the Installation Privacy Act Official with preliminary facts of the incident,  and  if  applicable,  the  organization‘s  Information  Systems  Security  Officer for incidents involving e-PHI or information systems.  (T-1) AFMOA the 6.4.1.1.3.  Submit  US-CERT  ONLY  if  a  Federal  information  system  has  been potentially compromised, pursuant to AFI 33-332, paragraph 1.1.2.4.5.2.  US-CERT filings are required within one hour of the PII breach being identified by an agency’s top-level  Computer Security  Incident Response Team  (CSIRT), Security  Operations Center (SOC), or information technology department, as described in the 2017 “US-CERT  Federal  Incident  Notification  Guidelines,”  published  by  the  United  States Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team,  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS).  (T-1)  In the event of future US-CERT notification guidance published by DHS, the future guidance will prevail. 6.4.1.1.3.1.  In cases where US-CERT reporting is required, initiate notification at https://forms.us-cert.gov/report.    (T-1)    Print  a  copy  of  the  completed  US-CERT notification and document the US-CERT confirmation number.  (T-1) 6.4.1.1.3.2.  Maintain a copy of the US-CERT notification.  (T-1) 6.4.1.2.  Within 24 HOURS from the breach becoming known. 6.4.1.2.1.  The  BRC/HPO  will  continue  activities  to  contain  the  exposure  of information  and  limit  the  magnitude  of  the  incident  as  quickly  as  practical.    (T-2)  This  could  be  as simple  as securing loose documentation  or as complex as securing electronic information systems and networks. Other actions include securing physical evidence  and  evaluating  associated  information  systems  and  activities  for  collateral risks and vulnerabilities. 6.4.1.2.1.1.  Initiate a local events log and maintain comprehensive documentation of  dates,  times,  significant  communications,  mitigation  activities,  and  events throughout the duration of the incident.  (T-0) 6.4.1.2.2.

(T-1) 6.4.1.2.3.  For  situations in  which  there  is  a  lost  or  missing  service  treatment  record (STR),  all  search  requirements  must  be  exhausted  before  the  record  is  declared  lost IAW AFI 41-210, paragraph 5.7.5.4.  (T-1)  Lost or missing STRs should be treated as one initial/final after action report IAW paragraph 6.7.1.5. 6.4.1.2.4.  Submit  the  initial  DD  Form  2959  via  e-mail  to  AFMOA  HIPAA (usaf.jbsa.afmoa.mbx.hipaa@mail.mil)  and  the  Installation  Privacy  Act  Official.  (T-1) 6.4.1.2.4.1.  If  breach  notifications  are  required  under  both  HIPAA  and  Privacy Act,  the  BRC/HPO  must  work  closely  with  the  Installation  Privacy  Act  Official throughout  the  course  of  incident  to  ensure  all  reporting  and  individual notification actions are accomplished.  (T-1) 34 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 6.4.1.2.4.1.1.  If  the  Privacy  Act  Official  determines  reporting  under  the Privacy  Act  is  not  required,  fully  document  the  decision  and  maintain  the documentation  in  the  case  file.    (T-1)    The  BRC/HPO  will  still  need  to evaluate the circumstances to determine if reporting is required under HIPAA.  (T-0) 6.4.1.2.4.1.2.  Installation  Privacy  Act  Official  will  forward  the  DD  Form 2959 to the Air Force Privacy Office (SAF/A6PP) within 24 hours IAW AFI 33-332, paras. 1.1.2.4.5.4 and 1.1.2.4.5.5. 6.4.1.2.4.1.3.  (T-1)  SAF/A6PP,  IAW  applicable  Privacy  Act  policies  and procedures, has agreed to facilitate any reporting requirements to the DPCLD for Privacy Act breaches only. 6.4.1.2.4.1.4.  SAF/A6PP  has  appropriate  access  to  systems  to  input  the information  from  the  DD  Form  2959  into  the  DPCLD  Compliance  and Reporting Tool (CART). 6.4.1.2.4.2.  AFMOA  HIPAA  will  forward  the  DD  Form  2959  to  DHA  PCLO, with a copy to the AFMS HPO within 24 hours of becoming aware of the breach. 6.4.1.2.4.3.  Do  not  delay  submission  of  the  initial  report  while  gathering additional information. 6.4.1.2.5.  Additional Notifications may be required. 6.4.1.2.5.1.  Ensure  the  Information  Systems  Security  Officer  is  notified  of  an ePHI incident. The security team will notify the servicing Network Control Center (NCC)  and  submit  follow-up  reports  as  necessary  to  meet  established  timelines based on the category of incident.  (T-2) 6.4.1.2.5.1.1.  Information  Assurance  personnel  will  initiate  simultaneous incident  response  procedures  while  the  BRC/HPO  continues  with  breach reporting activities.  (T-2) 6.4.1.2.5.1.2.  The security team may be required to submit additional reports depending on the type of system involved and whether the incident involved a confirmed  network/system  intrusion  or  changes  to  Information  Operations Condition (INFOCON). 6.4.1.2.5.2.  Upon direction of organizational leadership, notify the local Security Forces or Office of Special  Investigations (OSI) if the commission  of a crime is known or suspected.  (T-2) 6.4.1.2.5.3.  Notify  the  organization’s  appropriate  representative(s)  for  incidents involving  the  loss  or  suspected  loss  of  a  government  authorized  credit  card  or financial data associated with the card.  (T-1) 6.4.1.2.5.4.  If the incident involves contractors, the contracting officer should be engaged as soon as possible for contract compliance issues. 6.4.1.2.6.  With  the  facts  of  the  incident  known,  the  BRC/HPO  will  assess  whether the  incident  is  an  exception  to  the  breach  definition  or  the  level  of  probability  that AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 35 PHI  was  compromised  and  make  a  recommendation  to  organizational  leadership regarding the need to notify affected individuals of the compromise.  (T-0) 6.4.1.2.6.1.  A HIPAA breach excludes: 6.4.1.2.6.1.1.  Any  unintentional  acquisition,  access,  or  use  of  PHI  by  a workforce  member  or  person  acting  under  the  authority  of  the  MTF  or  a business associate, if such acquisition, access, or use was made in good faith and  within  the  scope  of  authority  and  does  not  result  in  further  use  or disclosure in a manner not permitted (Exception 1). 6.4.1.2.6.1.2.  Any  inadvertent  disclosure  by  a  person  who  is  authorized  to access  PHI  at  the MTF  or business  associate to  another person  authorized to access  PHI  at  the  same  MTF  or  business  associate,  or  organized  health  care arrangement in which the MTF may participate, and the information received as a result of such disclosure is not further used or disclosed in a manner not permitted (Exception 2). 6.4.1.2.6.1.3.  A disclosure of PHI where the MTF or business associate has a good  faith  belief  that  an  unauthorized  person  to  whom  the  disclosure  was made  would  not  reasonably  have  been  able  to  retain  such  information (Exception 3). 6.4.1.2.6.2.  If any of the above exceptions apply, the incident does not require the distribution of a breach notification letter to the patient. 6.4.1.2.6.2.1.  The MTF HPO must document the exception and maintain it in the investigation file IAW document retention requirements.  (T-0) 6.4.1.3.  Investigation. 6.4.1.3.1.  All incidents involving the compromise of PII and PHI must be thoroughly investigated and the level  of risk and compromise associated with  the incident must be assessed.   (T-0)  Minor incidents  may  be easily investigated and resolved by the BRC/HPO  alone,  whereas  more  complex  or  sensitive  incidents  may  necessitate  the activation of the organization‘s IRT or appointment of an investigating officer. 6.4.1.3.1.1.  A HIPAA Privacy Incident Report (HIPAA PIR) must be completed for each HIPAA privacy incident and submitted to AFMOA HIPAA.  (T-1)  The report  is  located  on  the  AFMOA  Health  Information  Compliance  Team  KX website. 6.4.1.3.2.  MTF  HPO  or  IO  should  interview  individuals  (active  duty,  government employees, contractor, or civilian) involved in the complaint or breach as necessary to the  investigation,  and  have  access  to  any  and  all  PHI  required  to  resolve  the complaint or breach.  The HPO should consult with the servicing legal officer prior to conducting interviews to determine what, if any, specific requirements apply. 6.4.1.3.3.  When assessing the nature and extent of the compromise, when there is a low  probability  of  compromise  or  there  is  no  compromise,  no  notification  to  the individual is required as it might create unnecessary concern or confusion.  (T-2)  The BRC/HPO  must  thoroughly  document  the  circumstances  of  all  breaches  and  the decisions  made  relative  to  each  of  the  factors  identified  in  the  HIPAA  PIR;  the 36 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 documentation  must  clearly  demonstrate  the  rationale  behind  the  notification determination  as  described  in  45  CFR  §164.402,  paragraph  (2)  regarding  the presumption of a breach and the four factors.  (T-0) 6.4.1.3.4.  The  DD  Form  2959  may  be  updated  and  re-submitted  to  the  Installation Privacy Act Official and AFMOA HIPAA team as additional information and follow-up actions become known throughout the course of the investigation. 6.4.1.3.5.  If  the  findings  of  the  investigation  confirm  a  breach  occurred,  the  MTF HPO will recommend corrective actions to the MTF Commander, or MAJCOM if the investigation involves the Commander.  (T-1)  The MTF HPO will also recommend actions to mitigate, to the extent possible, any harmful effect of a confirmed breach.  (T-0) 6.4.1.3.5.1.  Actions taken reduce the severity of the incident and prevent similar recurrences. 6.4.1.3.5.1.1.  Written  attestation  is  one  form  of  mitigation  that  can  occur when  PHI  has  been  released  to  an  incorrect  or  unintended  recipient.    The MDG should: 6.4.1.3.5.1.1.1.  Contact the recipient and request the return or destruction of the PHI, if it has not been reported to the HPO by the recipient already. 6.4.1.3.5.1.1.2.  Obtain  from  the  recipient  a  written  attestation  (e.g.,  via  e-mail or fax) that they have either returned or destroyed “any and all PHI and retained no copies or further used or disclosed the PHI to any another person or entity.” 6.4.1.3.5.1.1.3.  Situations where an attestation may be required include: 6.4.1.3.5.1.1.3.1.  When  an  individual  has  received  PHI  belonging  to another patient (copies of medical records/documents) and the individual does not have an obligation to protect the PHI; or 6.4.1.3.5.1.1.3.2.  When  an  (unintended) individual  or  entity  has incorrectly  received  PHI  (misdirected  e-mail,  mail,  CD-ROM,  or  fax) and the individual/entity has no obligation under HIPAA or the Privacy Act to protect PHI or PII. 6.4.1.3.5.1.2.  Retain  the  written  attestation  in  the  investigation  file  IAW  the investigation document retention requirements.  (T-1) 6.4.1.3.6.  The MTF is required to apply sanctions (disciplinary action) depending on the nature of the incident.  (T-0) 6.4.1.3.6.1.  Members  of  the  military  may  be  sanctioned  in  accordance  with  the provisions of AFI 36-2907 or the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 6.4.1.3.6.2.  Civilian  employees  may  be  sanctioned  in  accordance  with  the provisions of AFI 36-704. 6.4.1.3.6.3.  Contractor  personnel  may  be  sanctioned applicable procurement regulations. in  accordance  with AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 37 6.4.1.3.7.  An MTF may not threaten, intimidate, coerce, harass, discriminate against, or take any other retaliatory action against any individual for:  filing of a complaint; testifying,  assisting,  or  participating  in  an  investigation,  compliance  review, proceeding,  or  hearing;  or  opposing  any  act  or  practice  that  involves  the impermissible disclosure of PHI (in violation of the HIPAA rules.  (T-0) 6.4.1.3.8.  Disclosures by whistleblowers.  An MTF is not considered to have violated HIPAA if a member of its workforce or a business associate discloses PHI, provided that the workforce member or business associate believes in good faith that the MTF has engaged in conduct that is unlawful or otherwise violates professional or clinical standards,  or  that  the  care,  services,  or  conditions  provided  by  the  MTF  potentially endangers one or more patients, workers, or the public; and 6.4.1.3.8.1.  The  disclosure  is  to  a  health  oversight  agency  or  public  health authority  authorized  by  law  to  investigate  or  otherwise  oversee  the  relevant conduct  or  conditions  of  the  MTF  or  to  an  appropriate  health  care  accreditation organization  for  the  purpose  of  reporting  the  allegation  of  failure  to  meet professional  standards  or  misconduct  by  the  covered  entity;  or  an  attorney retained  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  workforce  member  or  business  associate  for  the purpose  of  determining  the  legal  options  of  the  workforce  member  or  business associate with regard to the conduct described above. 6.4.1.3.9.  Disclosures by workforce members who are victims of a crime.  An MTF is  not  considered  to  have  violated  HIPAA  if  a  member  of  its  workforce  who  is  the victim of a criminal act discloses PHI to a law enforcement official, provided that the PHI  disclosed  is  about  the  suspected  perpetrator  of  the  criminal  act;  and  the  PHI disclosed is limited to the information listed in DoD 6025.18-R, C8.6.2. 6.5.  Notification Procedures to Affected Individuals. 6.5.1.  The Privacy Act and HIPAA have different notification timelines. 6.5.1.1.  If  a  breach  has  been  confirmed  under  both  the  Privacy  Act  and  HIPAA, notification to affected individuals is required within the ten (10) working days after the loss,  theft,  or  compromise  is  confirmed  and  the  identities  of  the  affected  individuals  is ascertained, as established by DoD 5400.11-R and AFI 33-332.  (T-0) 6.5.1.2.  If  a  breach  has  been  confirmed  under  HIPAA  only,  notification  to  affected individuals is required without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach.  (T-0) 6.5.2.  The  BRC/HPO  will  ensure  notification  letters  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  DoD 5400.11-R, paragraph C1.5.1.5., and the notification content required by HIPAA outlined in 45 CFR §164.404(b) and (b).  (T-0) 6.5.2.1.  The content of the Privacy Act notification template is not sufficient to meet the HIPAA  notice  requirements.   The  following  two  additional  elements  must  be incorporated into the letter: (T-0) 6.5.2.1.1.  The  date  of  the  breach  and  the  date  of  the  discovery  of  the  breach,  if known. 38 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 6.5.2.1.2.  The contact procedures for the recipient to ask questions or learn additional information.  This  information  must  include  a  toll  free  telephone  number,  an  e-mail address, Web site, or postal address.  (T-0) 6.5.3.

Health record audits are a mechanism for determining access to a patient’s EHR (i.e. for treatment, payment, and health care operation functions).  To assist in the investigation of impermissible  access,  audit  reports  can  serve  as  a  valuable  tool  when  determining  if  EHRs have been inappropriately accessed.  Audit reports are not part of the designated record  set, and  therefore,  are  not  subject  to  a  patient’s  right  to  access  under  HIPAA.    However,  if  the audit report is  maintained or retrieved by the individual's name or other  personal  identifier, the individual may be entitled to access the report under the Privacy Act. 8.1.2.  The  MTF  Commanders  will  ensure  that  a  minimum  of  two  Health  Record  Auditors (HRAs)  are  appointed,  trained,  and  provided  the  appropriate  access  to  the  health  records systems to facilitate the generation of audit reports.  (T-1)  The MTF HIPAA Privacy and/or Security Officers may be appointed as HRAs. 8.1.3.  The MTF HIPAA Privacy Officer’s (HPO) office will maintain a signed copy of the MTF/CC HRA appointment letter.  (T-1)  The MTF HPO will review the letter annually to ensure the names of the identified HRAs are accurate and correct.  (T-1) 8.1.4.  The  HPO  or  HSO  will  be  the  point(s)  of  contact  for  requesting  health  record  audits.  (T-1) 8.1.4.1.  Requests for health record audits will contain the following information:  (T-1) 8.1.4.1.1.  Name/rank of the requestor 8.1.4.1.2.  Requestor’s office symbol 8.1.4.1.3.  Date of request 8.1.4.1.4.  Reason for the audit 8.1.4.1.5.  Details of the audit (e.g., patient name, user name, date range, etc.) 8.1.5.  The  HPO/HSO  will  obtain  MTF/CC  or  designee  approval  of  health  audit  record request.  (T-1) 8.1.6.  The HPO/HSO will coordinate completion of the audit with the Information Systems Office.  (T-1) 8.1.7.  The  HPO/HSO  and  SGH  or  MDG/CC  will  review  the  audit  prior  to  providing  the results to the requestor.  (T-1) 8.1.8.  The HPO/HSO will maintain documentation of the audit for 6 years.  (T-0)  Reference DoD 6025.18-R, C14.10.. 8.2.  Requesting a Health Record Audit for Breach Incidents. 8.2.1.  Once  the  HPO  has  determined  that  an  audit  is  required  to  assist  in  a  breach investigation,  the  HPO  will  obtain  MTF/CC  or  designee  written  approval  to  run  the  audit report.

Business  Associate  Agreements  (BAAs)  and/or  Data  Use/Sharing Agreements  (DSA),  required  by  DoD  6025.18-R,  must  be  incorporated  into  MTF  contracts and/or Memorandum of Understanding/Agreements (MOU/As), as necessary.  (T-0) 9.1.1.  DoD  6025.18-R,  C3.1.  establishes  responsibilities  for  business  associates  that  are components  of  the  Department  of  Defense.    A  written  BAA  is  not  required.    Consult  with MTF HPO and MLC/SJA for any additional agreements that might be required. 9.1.1.1.  For example:  When the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program is under the  authority  of  the  installation  senior  medical  officer,  but  the  EMS  personnel  are attached to the Civil Engineering Squadron (CES), even though they perform or assist in performing  a  function  or  activity  involving  the  use  or  disclosure  of  individually identifiable  health  information  on  behalf  of  the  EMS  program,  they  are  a  business associate. 9.1.2.  In the event that an external vendor/contractor is determined to be a business associate of the MTF, the MTF must have a written BAA in place.  The most current BAA template can be found on the AFMOA Health Information Compliance Team KX website. 9.1.2.1.  The  BAA  should  be  incorporated  into  the  master  agreement  between  the  MTF and  vendor/contractor. 9.1.3.  If  deviations  from  the  AFMS  approved  BAA  or  DSA  are  requested  by  the  business associate,  the  MTF  should  submit  the  agreement  to  the  MTF  HPO  for  review.    The  MTF HPO will work with MLC/SJA for review/approval prior to signing. 9.1.4.  Business associates are required to complete HIPAA privacy training. 9.1.5.  The  MTF  should  work  with  the  MTF  HPO  and  contracting  office  for  an  accurate inventory of business associates and agreements. 9.2.  Health  Information  Exchanges/Organizations  (HIE/O).  HIE/Os allow providers secure access to share a patient’s health information electronically. 9.2.1.  The DoD is a participant in the eHealth Exchange and has executed the required Data Use  and  Reciprocal  Support  Agreement  (DURSA)  that  represents  a  framework  for  broad-based information exchange among participants.  As such, it is currently the only approved HIE/O for use by MTFs. 9.2.2.  For any requests for participation in a HIE/O, other than as outlined above, contact the AFMOA HIPAA team for additional guidance and information.    50 AFI41-200  25 JULY 2017 9.3.  Patient  Safety  Organizations  (PSO).  It  is  permissible for MTFs to  participate in  patient safety activities, as defined in 42 CFR 3.20, and are deemed to be part of the MTFs health care operations.  PSOs must be treated as business associates IAW paragraph 9.1.  (T-0)  MARK A.
