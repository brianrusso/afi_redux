A lead assessor is necessary to coordinate and manage the assessment team. It is his/her responsibility to assign all tasks associated with the assessment and to ensure that the assessment is completed on schedule. 2.  Individuals from various organizations that can support data collection requests are identified. The team members should have strong technical backgrounds and familiarity with TIC/TIM assessment methodology; Site-specific TICs/TIMs, including installation infrastructure, base operations, and off-base industries; TIC/TIM characteristics and health effects; and transport of contaminants via air (outdoors and indoors) and water. 3.  Stakeholders, those with an interest in the outcome of the assessment, can include those organizations above with the addition of others not directly involved in the assessment. Collectively, they can include the following individuals, organizations and entities:   Bioenvironmental Engineering (BE)    Radiation Safety Officer (RSO)    Antiterrorism Officer (ATO)    Office of Special Investigations (OSI)/Intel    Security Forces    Civil Engineering (CE)  o  Hazardous Material Pharmacy Manager  o  Safety Office  o  Weather Office  o  Public Health  o  Contractor Support  o  Off-Base LEPC Representative(s)  o  Off-Base SERC Representative(s)  o  Railroad Company Environmental Safety Officer(s).        Use Form 1-1: Stakeholders Listing, from the TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide.   4.  It is recommended that the TIC of concern include toxic substances regulated under EPA Risk Management Plan (RMP) program and toxic chemicals for which NIOSH has determined Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) concentration values. The TIMs also include Toxic Industrial Biologicals (TIBs) and Toxic Industrial Radiologicals (TIRs).  5.  The assessors should collect information about the various transportation routes (railway, highway, and waterway) near the base and evaluate each for the possibility of a TIC/TIM release. Railroad companies and trucking firms maintain records/manifests that list type, quantity, and frequency of shipments that could impact a site assessment. 6. The possible sources to contact may include the following:   HAZMART Pharmacy to obtain a list of hazardous materials (to include toxics) from the master chemical authorization database   Hazardous Waste Program Manager to obtain a copy of the latest hazardous waste stream inventory   Central Hazardous Waste Storage Facility Manager to obtain information on hazardous waste stored at the installation hazardous waste storage facility    Base Supply to obtain a list of any chemicals on base that are not obtained through HAZMART Pharmacy   CE Storage Tank Manager to obtain information on any storage tanks containing toxic chemicals (e.g., hydrazine, hydrochloric acid)   Installation Fire Department and/or EM to obtain information on response scenarios based on known chemicals on base   Installation Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) to obtain information on industrial radiation sources on base.   Medical Infection Control Officer to obtain a list of TIBs 7.  Use Form 1-3: Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials (TIC/TIM) Inventory, from TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide to compile comprehensive TIC/TIM inventory. 8.  The base map should be wide-ranging enough to include Zone 1 (an area where death may result), Zone 2 (an area where severe injuries and/or illnesses may result), and Zone 3 (an area where minor injuries and/or illnesses may result). The map should include at least a 20-mile radius around the base. Use the map for identifying location of TIC/TIM. 9.  Wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric stability are expressed using the Pasquill stability classes. Use Form 1-2: Meteorological Data Worksheet, from TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide 10.  Use Form 1-4: Levels of Concern (LOCs) Table for TIC from TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide. 11.  The following items should be included on these maps:   TIC/TIM identifiers and locations   Base facilities and critical assets  44 AFQTP 4B051-3                                                                   Journeyman Training Guide:  OEH Program Overview    Transportation assets, including roads, railroads, and base access points 12.  Form 1-5: TIC/TIM Inventory Hazard Zones from the TIC/TIM Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide can be used in determining each scenario. 13.  The severity rating can be catastrophic, critical, moderate, or negligible. The probability rating is expressed as frequent (or likely), occasional, seldom, or unlikely. Use the Operational Risk Management (ORM) Risk Assignment Matrix to assign risk to each scenario. It is located on page 29 of USAFSAM, Toxic Industrial Chemicals/Toxic Industrial Materials Vulnerability Assessment Technical Guide, July 2009 14.  Upon completion of the field assessment, the team should document and consolidate results. The report should include the following elements:   Executive Summary   Introduction   Methodology   Scope and Limitations   TIC/TIM Assessment and Inventory   Risk Assessment   Conclusion   References   Appendices (forms, maps/plots, weather data, comprehensive inventory)       The report will typically be generated in classified and/or unclassified version(s). A classified version is stored on the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) and is available only to personnel with the proper security clearance.    45 AFQTP 4B051-3                                                                   Journeyman Training Guide:  OEH Program Overview  TRAINEE REVIEW QUESTIONS       STS Line Item 4.1.4.1:  Collect data required in TIC/TIM vulnerability assessment 1.
