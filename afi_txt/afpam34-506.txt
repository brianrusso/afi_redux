SUMMARY OF CHANGES This  revision  includes  Dignified  Transfer  and  updated  family  travel  eligibility  for  Dignified Transfers, installation memorial service, and funeral/burial. 1.  Mortuary Services.  In accordance with Titles 10 United States Code Section 1481, members who die while on active duty or inactive duty status are authorized certain mortuary entitlements.  Recognizing honorable, faithful service given to our nation, the Air Force continues to care for its  own  and  stands  ready  to  assist  and  extend  mortuary  services  entitlements  to  the  extent possible as permitted by law.  Following official notification, the person you have designated as 2 AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 the  person  authorized  to  direct  disposition  (PADD),  of  your  remains,  will  be  briefed  by  a mortuary officer. 1.1.  The PADD is the individual predetermined by you to direct disposition of your remains as indicated on DD Form 93, Record of Emergency Data, or virtual Record Emergency Data (vRED). If for any reason the PADD is not predetermined by you on DD Form 93 or vRED or  if  the  PADD  waives  his/her  right  to  direct  disposition,  this  role  will  automatically  fall upon  the  next  of  kin  (NOK)  based  upon  order  of  precedence  delineated  in  Title  10  United States Code Section 1482. 2.  Deaths Occurring in the United States Including Alaska and Hawaii. 2.1.  When an active duty member dies and Air Force Casualty confirms that all notifications are complete, the mortuary officer nearest the place of death will brief the PADD and obtain disposition instructions by telephone or personal visit depending on the distance between the mortuary officer and the location of the PADD. 2.2.  The  mortuary  officer  is  responsible  for  the  search,  recovery,  and  identification  of remains;  the  care  and  handling  of  remains;  assisting  the  PADD  with  disposition arrangements;  transportation  of  the  remains;  providing  an  escort;  arranging  for  military honors  at  the  place  of  burial;  and  return  of  all  personal  effects  and  property  to  the  person eligible  to  receive  effects  (PERE).  Additionally,  the  mortuary  officer  or  technician  will arrange travel to and from the place of final disposition for all authorized travelers. 3.  Deaths  Occurring  Outside  the  United  States  Excluding  Alaska  and  Hawaii.  When  a death occurs Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS), the location of the PADD is the determining  factor  as  to  where  the  mortuary  officer  support  will  be  assigned.  Either  the installation  mortuary  officer  or  a  mortuary  officer  from  the  Air  Force  Mortuary  Affairs Operation  Center,  Mortuary  Affairs  Division  (AFMAO/MA)  will  brief  the  PADD  and  obtain their instructions for the disposition of the fallen. 3.1.  Care and Return of Remains From OCONUS. 3.1.1.  The  Air  Force  and  the  other  services  operate  mortuaries  in  certain  overseas locations for deaths occurring in the geographic areas served by those mortuaries. 3.1.2.  As  soon  as  the  overseas  mortuary  receives  the  fallen,  they  care  for  them  as expeditiously  as  possible  and  promptly  return  them  to  the  Continental  United  States (CONUS).  However,  when  a  death  occurs  overseas,  there  is  a  lapse  of  several  days before  the  remains  arrive  at  a  CONUS  port  of  entry,  AFMAO  Port  Mortuary,  Dover AFB, DE or receiving funeral home.  There are several reasons for the lapse time: 3.1.2.1.  Upon the death, local civil authorities may hold the remains for a period of at least  a  day  or  more  for  their  investigative  purposes  and  to  provide  the  required documents to move the remains out of country. 3.1.2.2.  When  the  host  foreign  nation  or  United  States  military  medical  authorities require  an  autopsy,  this  can  take  additional  one  or  two  days.  This  timeline  can  be extended  due  to  national  holidays  or  weekends,  in  which  medical  authorities  may choose not to complete their investigation and release the fallen. 3.1.2.3.  Transferring the remains to the responsible military mortuary and preparing (embalming) them for movement to CONUS usually takes 24 to 36 hours. AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 3 3.1.2.4.  The  overseas  mortuary  places  the  embalmed  remains  in  an  aluminum transfer case for transfer from the overseas mortuary to the CONUS port mortuary or a  military  specification  casket  for  transfer  directly  to  a  receiving  funeral  home.  The overseas mortuary arranges for the return of the remains to the United States on either the first available Air Mobility Command (AMC) aircraft bound for the CONUS port or on a commercial aircraft. The remains could leave the same day they are released by the mortuary or the next day, depending on the availability and scheduling of the aircraft.  Therefore,  another  day’s  time  is  expended  in  the  return  of  the  remains. Weather or maintenance problems may provide additional delays. 3.2.  CONUS Port Mortuary Operations. 3.2.1.  Upon arrival at the port mortuary facility, the remains are processed or reprocessed and prepared for onward movement to final destination usually within a 48-hour period. 3.2.2.  The port mortuary personnel perform the following actions: 3.2.2.1.  Process or reprocess remains and administer additional treatment, to include wrapping non-viewable remains, performing restorative artwork, applying cosmetics, and dressing viewable remains. 3.2.2.2.  Ensures the fallen is placed in the Armed Forces specification casket selected by the PADD, and encases the casket in an outer shipping container (air tray). 3.2.2.3.  Brief  the  escort  on  his  or  her  duties  and  provide  proper  documents.  If  an escort is not identified, the Port Mortuary will appoint one of equal or higher rank. 3.2.2.4.  Prepare  all  necessary  documents,  permits  and  performs  final  quality assurance inspection prior to departure. 3.2.2.5.  Schedules military/contract military air, commercial air, or hearse delivery to transport the remains and escort to the final destination. 3.2.3.  When the PADD requests cremation, the mortuary officer will provide a cremation permit and the specification urn selected by the PADD. 3.3.  Deaths Occuring in Combat Theater of Operations. 3.3.1.  A  Dignified  Transfer  (DT)  will  be  held  for  service  members  who  die  in  combat theaters of operation and whose remains are returning to the Port Mortuary, Dover AFB, DE.  Additionally, the PNOK may  elect  to  authorize media access  to  capture the DT at Dover  AFB,  DE.    The  Media  Coverage  can  include  DoD  photography/videography coverage and/or public media or be limited to DoD coverage exclusively.  The PNOK has the  authority  to  exclude  all  media  outlet  coverage.    AFI  36-3002,  Casualty  Services, provides  specific  guidelines  in  the  DoD  approved  script  for  the  PNOK  to  determine media access and other NOK afforded travel to witness the DT at Dover AFB, DE.  3.3.1.1.  A  General  Officer  from  the  fallen  Airman’s  functional  community  will attend the DT at Dover AFB, DE.  All eligible Service members will receive Military Funeral Honors in accordance with AFI 34-501.     4 AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 4.  Mortuary Services Entitlements. 4.1.  When remains are recovered and individually identified, the PADD may direct the Air Force  accomplish  the  following  through  its  contract  funeral  home  (or  government  operated overseas mortuary). 4.1.1.  Remove the remains from the place of death or the place where authorities release the remains to the contract funeral home. 4.1.2.  Prepare (embalming) the remains. 4.1.3.  Wrap  non-viewable  remains  and  position  remains  and  uniform  in  the  casket  or restore, cosmetize, dress, and casket viewable remains. 4.1.4.  The PADD may select one of two Armed Services specification caskets. 4.1.4.1.  An  18-gauge  metal  protective  casket.  The  exterior  is  silver,  silver  tone  or gray  in  color.  The  interior  of  the  casket  is  equipped  with  an  adjustable  innerspring mattress, and the casket is upholstered with a white or eggshell crepe fabric. 4.1.4.2.  A solid hardwood casket. The exterior is walnut in color. The interior of the casket  is  equipped  with  an  adjustable  innerspring  mattress,  and  the  casket  is upholstered with a rose, tan or ecru crepe fabric. 4.1.5.  Provide an outer shipping container (air tray) for the casket.  This is to protect the casket  while  in  transit.  NOTE:  The  Air  Force  provides  all  items  of  service  or merchandise listed above at no cost to the PADD. 4.2.  If the PADD prefers to make his or her own arrangements for the above items, he or she may  do  so,  but  this  alternative  is  generally  limited  to  deaths  occurring  within  the  United States due to the complexity involved in the transportation of remain when outside the United States.  The  mortuary  officer  will  provide  the  current  monetary  allowances  for  this  option during the mortuary briefing. 4.2.1.  The  Air  Force  will  reimburse  the  PADD  up  to  the  maximum  authorized  amount for Option 5, which includes all associated funeral and cemetery expenses. 4.2.2.  In  addition,  the  Air  Force  will  reimburse  all  expenses  for  the  transportation  of remains. 5.  Remains  Disposition  Options.  The  PADD  may  elect  one  of  the  following  options.  The mortuary  officer  provides  monetary  reimbursement  allowances  for  each  option  in  the entitlements  briefing.  The  reimbursement  amounts  are  not  published  due  to  continued adjustments in the entitlements. The mortuary officer will provide the current entitlements at the time of the PADD briefing. 5.1.  Option  1.  Consign  the  remains  directly  to  a  government  cemetery.  This  means  there would be no funeral home used and there would be no funeral service. Since there would be no expenses incurred at the government cemetery, the PADD is reimbursed a limited sum to help pay for an expense such as the purchase of a floral arrangement, acknowledgment cards, newspaper notice, and so forth. 5.2.  Option  2.    Consign  the  remains  to  a  funeral  home  selected  by  the  PADD  to  conduct desired  visitations  and  services,  followed  by  interment  in  a  government  cemetery.  Since AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 5 expenses would be incurred with the funeral home, the PADD may be reimbursed a limited sum  to  help  pay  for  expenses,  such  as  the  professional  fee  of  a  funeral  director,  use  of  the funeral home and equipment for a visitation and funeral service, motor vehicles (limousines, floral delivery vehicle, lead car, car for the clergy), purchase of a burial vault or grave liner, religious  item  for  the  casket,  flowers,  register  book,  prayer  cards,  acknowledgment  cards, funeral programs, newspaper notice, clergy honorarium and music (organist, vocalist), and so forth. 5.3.  Option  3.  Consign  the  remains  to  a  funeral  home  selected  by  the  PADD  to  conduct desired  visitations  and  services  followed  by  interment  in  a  non-government  (private) cemetery. Since expenses would be incurred at both the funeral home and the cemetery, the PADD may be reimbursed a limited sum to help pay for expenses already specified in Option 2  and  cemetery  expenses  such  as  purchase  of  a  single  grave  space,  outer  burial  container, opening and closing of the grave, use of cemetery equipment, purchase of a headstone from a commercial monument company, and so forth. 5.4.  Option  4.  Consign  the  fallen  to  a  funeral  home,  selected  by  the  PADD,  to  conduct desired arrangements that can include a visitation and services followed by cremation. 5.4.1.  The fallen will be prepared and placed in a solid hardwood casket. The casket will be draped in a US Burial Flag and escorted to the receiving funeral home. 5.4.2.  The  receiving  funeral  home  will  perform  the  cremation  in  accordance  with statutory provisions and the Air Force will assume the cost. 5.4.3.  The  Air  Force  provides  the  PADD  a  choice  of  two  Armed  Forces  specification urns,  a  solid  walnut  urn  or  bronze  urn.  Each  are  cube-like  in  design  with  the  US  Air Force  seal  affixed  and  either  will  be  engraved  with  the  name,  grade,  date  of  birth,  and date of death of the fallen. 5.4.3.1.  The  receiving  funeral  home  will  place  the  cremated  remains  in  the  urn selected by the next of kin. 6.  Interment Flag(s) and Flag Case(s).  A United States of America flag and a solid hardwood flag case will be presented to those listed in paragraphs  6.1 through  6.4 at the conclusion of the service. 6.1.  Spouse 6.2.  Children 6.3.  The father and mother (if not the primary next of kin). If legally separated or divorced, each parent will receive a flag. 6.4.  The PADD, if not already covered in paragraphs  6.1 through  6.3 7.  Escort for the Remains. 7.1.  Special  Escort.  The  PADD  may  request,  by  name,  a  current  serving  member  of  the military  from  any  branch  of  Service  to  be  the  “Special  Escort”.    A  special  escort  can  be requested for any scenario as long as time constraints, clearances, passports, etc. are in order.   7.2.  Appointed Escort. When the PADD does not specifically request a military member by name to serve as the escort, the Mortuary Officer, in conjunction with the commander of the 6 AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 unit  of  the  deceased,  will  designate  a  military  member  of  equal  or  higher  rank  than  the decedent. 8.  Military Honors. 8.1.  Military funeral honors are furnished at the place of burial, if possible. For Active Duty decedants,  military  funeral  honors  consist  of  pallbearers,  firing  party,  bugler,  color  guard, and an Air Force chaplain, if specifically requested by the PADD. 8.2.  Flyover.    If  you are serving as a  rated officer or enlisted aircrew member  and hold  an aeronautical  rating  on  an  active  duty  status,  or  pursuing  a  course  of  instruction  leading  to such a rating at the time of death,  your PADD may request  a flyover at the place of burial. The  performance  of  a  flyover  depends  on  the  availability  of  aircraft  at  the  given  time  and date, minimum weather requirements, and approvals for the required air space. 9.  Veterans Administration Benefits. 9.1.  The Veterans Administration will provide a government headstone free of cost to mark the  grave.  The  type  and  style  of  headstone  depends  on  the  requirement  or  restrictions specified by the cemetery concerned. 9.2.  Veterans  may  be  interred  in  a  national  cemetery.  A  veteran’s  spouse  and  dependent children  may  also  be  buried  in  the  same  grave  site.  The  mortuary  officer  will  discuss  the limitations in detail during the PADD briefing. 10.  Family Travel. 10.1.  Installation  Memorial  Service  and  Funeral/Burial.  Authorized  travelers  to  include spouse, dependent children (natural, step, adopted), parents (natural, step, adopted), siblings of the deceased (natural, half, adopted), and the PADD, if different from those listed above, may receive round-trip travel at Air Force expense to attend the funeral. The mortuary officer or technician will assist the travelers in making proper travel arrangements. Following travel, the  mortuary  technician  will  help  the  authorized  travelers  complete  and  submit  a  travel voucher for payment of limited per diem. 10.2.  Dignified Transfer (DT).  The PNOK will determine if family will attend the DT upon the  arrival  of  a  fallen  Airman  whose  remains  are  returned  through  Dover  AFB,  DE,  from Combat  Theaters  of  Operation.    The  travel  entitlement  is  determined  by  the  PNOK  and includes (2) additional family members.  11.  Disposition  of  Personal  Property.  The  Mortuary  Officer  will  request  the  Installation Commander appoint a Summary Courts Officer to carry out duties IAW AFI 34-511 and assist the  Person  Eligible  to  Receive  Effects  (PERE)  with  disposition  of  the  personal  property  and effects  of  the  decedent.    The  family  structure  of  the  deceased  and  marital  status  at  the  time  of death are governing factors in applying the law as to who is the recipient for the property. 12.  Death Certificate. 12.1.  For  deaths  occurring  in  the  United  States,  the  Primary  Next  of  Kin  (PNOK)  will  be provided  ten  (10)  copies  of  a  certified  state  death  certificate.  Additional  copies  may  be provided at the PNOK’s expense. The contract funeral home will obtain death certificates as part of their contractual requirements. Families may contact the Office of Vital Statistics in the county where the death occurred should additional copies be needed in the future. AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 7 12.2.  For  deaths  occurring  outside  the  United  States  and  its  territories,  the  PNOK  will  be provided  ten  (10)  copies  of  the  DD  1300,  Report  of  Casualty  and/or  certified  copies  of  the DD  2064,  Certificate  of  Death  (Overseas).  The  DD  1300  may  be  used  in  lieu  of  a  death certificate  when  proof  of  death  is  established  and  no  remains  are  recovered.  The  State Department may also issue a Report of Death Abroad for unique circumstances. 13.  Available  Entitlements  When  Remains  Are  Recovered  But  Cannot  Be  Individually Identified  by  Scientific  Means  (Group  Burial).  This  circumstance  requires  the  Air  Force  to arrange and effect a group burial for those remains that are not individually identified. The Air Force will do the following: 13.1.  Casket  remains  in  specification  metal  protective  caskets.  The  number  of  caskets  is predicated on the volume of remains, not the number of persons included in the group burial. 13.2.  Arrange the interment to be effected in Arlington National Cemetery. 13.3.  Arrange  and  pay  for  the  round  trip  travel  of  authorized  travelers  as  described  by paragraph  10.2 to attend the funeral. 13.4.  Assign an escort to accompany each casket that will be used. 13.5.  Conducts a nondenominational interment service. 13.6.  Provide  full  military  honors.  Details  pertaining  to  military  honors  are  contained  in paragraph  8.1 13.7.  A  United  States  burial  flag  will  drape  the  group  casket.  It  will  be  folded  at  the completion of the military funeral honors. This flag will not be presented but retained by the Air Force. United States burial flag(s) will be presented to those delineated in paragraphs  6.1 through    6.4  unless  an  individual  burial  has  already  been  conducted.  In  that  case,  only  the PNOK, for each fallen Airman, will be presented a flag and flag case. 13.8.  Provide a specially fabricated headstone to mark the group burial site. 13.9.  Provide each PADD with a specified allowance to help pay limited expenses that may be incurred for the interment service. This may be for the purchase of a floral arrangement, acknowledgment cards, etc. 13.10.  Return personal property and effects to the authorized recipient, as specified by law. 14.  Available  Entitlements  When  Remains  Are  Not  Recovered  (BNR).  This  situation  may be due to the type of incident that occurred or prevailing conditions at the scene, rendering the remains non-recoverable. Whatever the case, this circumstance precludes any funeral service and disposition of remains, so the Air Force will assist the PADD in arranging a memorial service, to honor the sacrifice of the fallen, with Air Force participation. 14.1.  Memorial Service. The memorial service may be conducted at a place selected by the PADD to include a place of worship, a funeral home, a cemetery (national or private), or a combination thereof. 14.1.1.  Military  honors  will  be  provided  at  the  place  of  service.  The  extent  of  those honors  depends  on  the  PADD’s  desires.  If  the  deceased  held  an  aeronautical  rating  or meets criteria outlined in paragraph . the PADD may request a flyover. 8 AFPAM34-506  12 NOVEMBER 2015 14.1.2.  At the conclusion of the service, a flag of the United States of America and a flag case is presented to those delineated in paragraphs  6.1 through  6.4 14.2.  Funeral  Travel.  Round trip travel  will  be provided at  Air Force expense to  attend the memorial service arranged by the PADD. Travel is authorized for those individuals described in paragraph  10.2 14.3.  Memorial  Marker.  The  Veterans  Administration  provides  a  memorial  marker  which may be placed in a national cemetery or private cemetery. 14.4.  Memorial  Service  Allowance.  The  Air  Force  will  provide  the  PADD  reimbursement for  a  memorial  service  to  help  pay  for  expenses  not  to  exceed  the  amount  allowed  for  a funeral with subsequent interment in a government cemetery. 14.5.  Personal  Property.  The  Air  Force  will  return  personal  effects  and  property  to  the authorized recipient as specified by law. 15.  Future  Planning.  A  “Mortuary  Planning  Sheet  for  Active  Duty  Air  Force  Members.”  is provided  in  Attachment  2.  This  guide  is  designed  to  alleviate  undue  burden  on  your  family members should  you become a casualty. Take the time to carefully review the information  and complete  the  attachment.  Provide  copies  of  your  expressed  wishes  contained  within  this attachment  to  your  family  members.
