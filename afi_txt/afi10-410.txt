Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC)  is  both  an  Air  Force major  command  (MAJCOM)  and  the  air  component  to  United  States  Special  Operations Command (USSOCOM), a unified combatant command (UCC). 1.1.1.  MAJCOM  Responsibilities.    As  an  Air  Force  MAJCOM  under  the  direction  of  the Secretary  of  the  Air  Force  (SECAF)  and  Chief  of  Staff  of  the  Air  Force  (CSAF),  the Commander, AFSOC (COMAFSOC), is responsible for training, organizing, equipping, and providing  operationally  ready  AFSOF  to  combatant  commanders.    AFSOC  also  provides operational  support  forces,  Special  Operations  (SO)  test  and  evaluation,  and  SO  education.  The  CSAF  has  designated  AFSOC  as  the  Air  Force  Lead  MAJCOM  for  SO  and  the Component MAJCOM to Commander, USSOCOM (CDRUSSOCOM). 1.1.2.  Air  Component  Responsibilities.    As  the  Air  Force  component  commander  to USSOCOM,  COMAFSOC  executes  or  directly  supports  the  following  primary  SO  core activities:    direct  action,  special  reconnaissance,  countering  weapons  of  mass  destruction, counterterrorism, unconventional  warfare,  foreign internal  defense/security force  assistance, hostage  rescue  and  recovery,  counterinsurgency,  humanitarian  assistance/disaster  relief, military information support operations (MISO), and civil affairs operations.  To accomplish these missions, AFSOC has identified the following core missions:  specialized air mobility; precision  strike;  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnaissance  (ISR);  battlefield  air operations;  aviation  foreign  internal  defense;  command  and  control;  agile  combat  support; and  Information  Operations  (IO)/MISO.    The  AFSOC  Core  Missions  are  defined  in  AF Doctrine Annex 3-05, Special Operations. 1.2.  Command Relationships. 1.2.1.  General.  The President and/or Secretary of Defense (SecDef) exercise authority over missions  and  forces  assigned  to  combatant  commands  through  the  combatant  commander (CCDR) with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  For purposes other than operational direction of forces assigned to the combatant commands, the President and/or Secretary of Defense exercise authority and control through the service secretaries and service chiefs of staff. 1.2.2.  Operational  Command  Relationships  (operational  direction  of  forces  assigned  to Combatant  Commands)  are  defined  in  Joint  Pub  1,  Doctrine  of  the  Armed  Forces  of  the United States. 1.2.2.1.  Unless  otherwise  directed  by  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  all  active  and  reserve special operations forces (SOF) are assigned to USSOCOM.  The combatant commanders of  the  various  geographic  combatant  commands  (GCCs)  exercise  operational  control (OPCON)  of  SOF  assigned  to  their  theaters  through  the  Theater  Special  Operations Command (TSOC) or other designated joint force commander. 1.2.2.2.  Operational Control (OPCON) is defined in Joint Pub 1, Doctrine of the Armed Forces of the United States.   4  AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015 1.2.2.2.1.  IAW  USSOCOM  Directive  10-1,  Terms  of  Reference  –  Roles,  Missions, and  Functions  of  Component  Commands,  the  Commander,  Air  Force  Special Operations  Air  Component  (COMAFSOAC)  exercises  OPCON  over  all  contiguous United  States  (CONUS)-based  AFSOF  (active  duty,  reserve,  and  ANG  on  Title  10 orders).    AFSOC  Wing,  Group,  and  Unit  commanders  exercise  command  authority consistent with G-Series Orders. 1.2.2.2.2.  The  combatant  commanders  of  the  various  GCCs  usually  exercise COCOM  and  OPCON  of  assigned  forces.    However,  per  the  11  February  2013 Forces  for  Unified  Commands  Memorandum,  CDRUSSOCOM  will  retain  COCOM of all SOF and TSOCs.  GCCs will exercise OPCON of forces attached via a SecDef-approved  deployment  order.    A  TSOC,  as  a  sub-unified  command,  are  generally delegated OPCON of assigned SOF. 1.2.2.2.2.1.  For  conventional  forces,  the  joint  force  commander  (JFC)  normally delegates OPCON to, or executes OPCON through, the Service components (e.g. OPCON  of  USAF  forces  delegated  to  the  Commander,  Air  Force  Forces (COMAFFOR)).    When  a  Service  component  is  designated  a  functional component  (e.g.  Joint  Force  Air  Component  Commander  (JFACC)),  the commander  of  that  functional  component  gains  assets  from  other  Service components  (e.g.  “excess”  USMC  sorties).    Unlike  the  larger  joint  force,  SOF routinely trains jointly and presents forces jointly.  The TSOC is the C2 element USSOCOM  uses  to  present  joint  SOF  to  the  theater  Joint  Force  Commander (JFC).    The  TSOC  normally  delegates  OPCON  of  AFSOF  to  a  joint  special operations  air  component  commander  (JSOACC).    Typically,  the  Commander, Air  Force  Special  Operations  Air  Component  (COMAFSOAC)  is  designated  as the JSOACC. 1.2.2.2.2.2.  In  smaller  operations,  the  JSOACC  or  COMAFSOAC  may  be subordinated  to  a  joint  special  operations  task  force  (JSOTF).    In  this  situation, the TSOC may choose to delegate OPCON to the JSOTF commander. 1.2.2.2.2.3.  Under  certain  circumstances,  a  JSOTF  commander  may  directly exercise OPCON of AFSOF, reporting to the President/SecDef through the CJCS. 1.2.2.3.  Tactical  Control  (TACON)  is  defined  in  Joint  Pub  1,  Doctrine  of  the  Armed Forces of the United States. 1.2.2.3.1.  The  combatant  commanders  of  the  various  GCCs  exercise  TACON  of forces  deployed  to  their  theaters  for  exercise  purposes.    TACON  of  forward-based and forward-deployed AFSOF is normally executed through a JSOACC. 1.2.2.4.  Other  Authorities.    In  addition  to  COCOM,  OPCON,  TACON,  and  support, recognized  operational  authorities  include  Direct  Liaison  Authority  (DIRLAUTH),  and Coordinating Authority (See JP 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States for definitions  and  discussion  of  these  authorities).    These  relationships  are  extremely flexible and specific authorities are established based upon the situation. 1.2.3.  Administrative  Control  (ADCON)  is  defined  in  Joint  Pub  1,  Doctrine  of  the  Armed Forces of the United States. AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015   5  1.2.3.1.  The  SECAF  exercises  primary  ADCON  of  all  active  duty  AFSOF  worldwide through CSAF to COMAFSOC, and of Air Force Reserve SOF through the Commander, Air  Force  Reserve  Command.    CDRUSSOCOM  exercises  specified  ADCON  over  all AFSOF  through  COMAFSOC.    CDRUSSOCOM’s  specified  ADCON  responsibilities include:  developing  strategy,  doctrine,  and  tactics;    preparing  and  submitting  program recommendations  and  budget  proposals  for  SOF  and  other  forces  assigned  to USSOCOM; exercising authority, direction, and control over the expenditure of funds for forces  assigned  to  the  Special  Operations  command  and  for  SOF  assigned  to  other combatant  commanders;  training  assigned  forces;  conducting  specialized  courses  of instruction  for  commissioned  and  noncommissioned  officers;  validating  requirements; establishing  priorities  for  requirements;  ensuring  the  interoperability  of  equipment  and forces; formulating and submitting requirements for intelligence support; monitoring the promotions, assignments, retention, training, and professional military education of SOF officers;  ensuring  the  combat  readiness  of  forces  assigned  to  the  Special  Operations command;  monitoring the preparedness  to  carry  out  assigned missions of SOF assigned to  other  combatant  commands;  development  and  acquisition  of  SO-peculiar  equipment; and acquisition of SO-peculiar material, supplies, and services. 1.2.3.2.  COMAFSOC  is  responsible  to  both  CDRUSSOCOM  and  CSAF  for  executing their separate world-wide ADCON responsibilities.  To ensure that those responsibilities are  adequately  executed  for  forward-based  or  forward-deployed  AFSOF,  COMAFSOC, in  coordination  with  CDRUSSOCOM  and  the  Commander,  Theater  Special  Operations Command,  nominates  a  Commander,  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces (COMAFSOF)  to  ensure  continuity  and  integration  of  operations  and  to  “carry” COMAFSOC’s  (and  hence  CDRUSSOCOM’s  and  CSAF’s)  ADCON  authorities forward. 1.2.3.3.  COMAFSOC will normally transfer specified elements of ADCON to Air Force installation  commanders  for  AFSOF  units  assigned/attached  to  Air  Force  installations (i.e.  AFSOF tenants).  The Air Force host installation commander will exercise his/her authority  over,  and  responsibilities  for,  Air  Force  forces  on  his/her  base  as  specified  in the  applicable  order  (e.g.   Deployment  Order  (DEPORD))  or  agreement  (e.g.  Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)).  Such authorities and responsibilities may include discipline administration under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), protection of  assigned  forces  and  assets,  billeting,  dining,  and  administrative  reporting.    Similarly, for  AFSOF  units  operating  on  expeditionary  Air  Force  installations  (i.e.    Air  Force officer  designated  as  installation  commander),  COMAFSOC  will  normally  transfer specified ADCON of those forces to the installation commander. 1.3.  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (AFSOC).  AFSOC  is  commanded  by  an  Air Force Lieutenant General, who is usually referred to as COMAFSOC.  AFSOC is responsible to organize, train, and equip AFSOF and has a full range of functional staff (AFI 38-101).  AFSOC is an Air Force MAJCOM, the Air Force Lead MAJCOM for Special Operations, the Air Force Lead MAJCOM for Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (SUAS), and the Component MAJCOM to USSOCOM. 1.3.1.  AFSOF  Units.  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces  are  composed  of  one  major command  (MAJCOM),  an  AFSOC  Operations  Center  (OC),  the  Air  Force  Special Operations  Air  Warfare  Center  (AFSOAWC),  four  active  duty  Special  Operations  Wings   6  AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015 (SOWs),  one  Air  Force  Reserve  SOW,  one  Air  National  Guard  SOW,  and  one  overseas Special Operations Group (SOG). AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015   7  Chapter 2 FORCE PRESENTATION FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 2.1.  Commander,  United  States  Special  Operations  Command  (CDRUSSOCOM).  For  a list  of all forces currently  designated as special operations forces, see the  SecDef Global  Force Management Implementation Guidance (GFMIG), Section II “Assignment of Forces (Forces For Unified  Commands),”  formerly  the  “Forces  For  Memorandum.”      The  Unified  Command  Plan (UCP) specifies that CDRUSSOCOM is the SOF Joint Force Provider, responsible for providing combat-ready SOF to  other combatant  commanders as directed; identifying and  recommending global  joint  sourcing  solutions  to  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS),  in coordination  with  the  Services  and  other  combatant  commanders,  from  all  special  operations forces and capabilities; and supervising the implementation of sourcing decisions.  For SOF Air Force  forces  assigned  to  or  gained  by  AFSOC  (generally  those  forces  funded  by  Major  Force Program 11), CDRUSSOCOM works through COMAFSOC to deploy active component and/or mobilize and deploy reserve component forces. 2.2.  Commander,  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Command  (COMAFSOC).  COMAFSOC is  charged with  providing trained and ready Air Force special operations forces to the CCDRs.  When  directed  by  CDRUSSOCOM,  COMAFSOC  deploys  active  component  AFSOF  and/or mobilizes and deploys reserve component forces. 2.3.  Combatant Commanders (CCDRs).  Title 10 United States Code, Section 162, states that, “A  force  assigned  to  a  combatant  command  or  to  the  United  States  element  of  the  North American  Aerospace  Defense  Command  under  this  section  may  be  transferred  from  the command  to  which  it  is  assigned  only  by  authority  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense;  and  under procedures prescribed by the Secretary and approved by the President.”  In accordance with the SecDef GFMIG, a CCDR requiring additional forces to meet operational requirements submits a Request for Forces (RFF) to the Joint Staff.  The Joint Staff, in coordination with the Joint Force Providers  (United  States  Strategic  Command  (USSTRATCOM),  USSOCOM,  United  States Transportation  Command  (USTRANSCOM)  and  Military  Services),  applicable  combatant commands, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), validates the RFF and identifies a sourcing solution, after which the CJCS certifies and releases force allocations orders (DEPORD, Prepare  to  Deploy  Order  (PTDO),  Global  Force  Management  Allocation  Plan  (GFMAP) Modifications, Execution Order (EXORD) Modification) under the authority of the SecDef.  For a detailed discussion of this process, see the SecDef GFMIG.  When forces arrive in theater, the CCDR determines the command relationships of those forces.  Normally, OPCON of SOF will be delegated to the TSOC.  Other forces required for execution of the SOF mission may also be provided OPCON to the TSOC. 2.4.  Theater  SOCs  (TSOCs).  TSOCs  (e.g.  Special  Operations  Command  Central,  or SOCCENT)  conduct  analyses  of  their  assigned  missions  and  determine  the  forces  required  to accomplish them.  If forces assigned are inadequate, they generate RFFs for submission to their combatant  commanders  for  validation  and  forwarding  to  the  SecDef.    When  special  operations forces  arrive  in  theater,  the  combatant  commanders  will  normally  delegate  OPCON  of  those forces to the TSOC for mission execution and may delegate OPCON of other forces required for execution of the SOF mission.  The TSOC may conduct reception, staging, onward movement, and  integration  of  forces  made  available  by  the  CCDR  to  prepare  them  for  combat  operations.    8  AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015 Once  those  forces  are  ready,  the  TSOC  makes  them  available  to  the  Joint  Forces  Special Operations Component Commander (JFSOCC) (usually the same commander, but has a different staff  function).    The  JFSOCC  executes  command  and  control  of  forces  provided  for  combat operations. 2.5.  CONUS-Based  Units.  Air  Force  units  (e.g.  1  SOW,  4  SOS)  are  established  through publication  of  G-Series  orders  under  the  authority  provided  the  Secretary  of  the  Air  Force SECAF  under  10  U.S.C.  §  8013.    CDRUSSOCOM  exercises  COCOM  of  AFSOF  while COMAFSOC has the responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces to present to combatant commanders.  When directed by the SecDef, CDRUSSOCOM as the SOF joint force provider, presents forces to GCCs. 2.6.  OCONUS-Based  Units.  Air Force units (e.g. 353 SOG, 67 SOS)  are  established through publication of G-Series orders under the authority provided the SECAF under 10 U.S.C. § 8013.  These forces are OPCON to the geographic combatant commanders by the GFMIG.  The GCCs usually execute OPCON of forces from those units through the TSOC; however the geographic combatant  commander  may  provide  forces  from  those  units  OPCON  to  another  geographic commander  after  coordination  with  USSOCOM,  as  the  SOF  Joint  Force  Provider  and  at  the direction of the SecDef. 2.7.  Expeditionary  Units.  Expeditionary  units  (e.g.    27  ESOG-S,  318  ESOS)  are  established through publication of G-Series orders under the authority provided the SECAF under 10 U.S.C. § 8013.  Air Force special operations forces attached OPCON (Change of Operational Control, or CHOP) to a combatant commander under a SecDef DEPORD or EXORD are administratively attached  to  those  units  to  fulfill  the  SECAF’s  requirement  to  provide  support  to  those  forces.  The  geographic  combatant  commanders  usually  exercise  OPCON  of  the  forces  assigned  to  the expeditionary units in  their area of responsibility (AOR) through the TSOC and JSOACC, and CDRUSSOCOM and the SECAF provide ADCON support (SOF-unique and Service-common, respectively) to the forces assigned to the expeditionary units through the COMAFSOAC. 2.8.  Overview of the RFF Process. 2.8.1.  Generating  the  RFF.  When  a  CCDR  is  given  a  mission,  he  conducts  a  mission analysis during which he identifies the forces required to meet operational requirements and tasks  to  subordinates  –  to  include  tasks  for  the  SOF  component.    The  TSOC  or,  when established,  the  JFSOCC  conducts  a  mission  analysis  for  those  tasks  that  the  CCDR  has given  him  and  similarly  identifies  the  forces  required  to  meet  operational  requirements.    If the TSOC/JFSOCC determines that he requires SOF air assets in excess of those assigned to him (to include Special Tactics Squadrons, Special Operations Weather Team (SOWT), and SOF  Tactical  Air  Control  Parties  (TACPs)),  he  submits  a  request  for  forces  (RFF)  to  the CCDR for validation.  The CCDR’s staff ensures that there are no assets assigned or attached to  his  command  that  can  satisfy  the  TSOC/JFSOCC  requirement  and,  if  there  are  none, submits the RFF to the Joint Staff for validation.  The CCDR will also submit RFFs for non-SOF  Air  Force  forces  to  the  Joint  Staff,  some  of  which  may  be  sourced  from  non-SOF personnel assigned to AFSOC (e.g.  Expeditionary Combat Support). 2.8.2.  Sourcing  Requests  for  Air  Force  SOF.  IAW  the  GFMIG,  the  Joint  Staff,  in coordination  with (USSTRATCOM,  USSOCOM, USTRANSCOM,  and  Military  Services),  applicable  combatant  commands,  and  the  OSD, validates  the  RFF  and  identifies  a  sourcing  solution.    Since  the  UCP  specifies  that Joint  Force  Providers the AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015   9  CDRUSSOCOM  is  the  SOF  Joint  Force  Provider,  RFFs  for  SOF  air  capabilities  will  be forwarded  to  USSOCOM  for  feasibility  assessment,  validation,  and  sourcing.    In  turn, USSOCOM will request a feasibility assessment from AFSOC as the Service component to USSOCOM.    AFSOC  will  look  at  what  forces  are  available  globally  (CONUS  and OCONUS),  and  make  a  sourcing  recommendation  to  USSOCOM.    If  the  recommended solution is to source forces from another geographic combatant command, USSOCOM will coordinate  with  that  command  prior  to  submitting  the  recommended  solution  to  the  Joint Staff. 2.8.3.  Sourcing Requests for Non-SOF.  Since the SecDef GFMIG specifies that the CJCS, through the Director, J3 (DJ3), is the Primary Joint Force Provider for conventional  forces, RFFs  for  conventional  capabilities  will  be  forwarded  to  the  Joint  Staff  for  feasibility assessment, validation and sourcing.  In turn, DJ3’s staff will request a feasibility assessment from  the  USAF  and  Air  Combat  Command  (ACC),  as  the  Service  component.      In coordination with the Air Force Personnel Center, ACC will look at what forces are available globally  (CONUS  and  OCONUS),  and  make  a  sourcing  recommendation.    If  the recommended solution is to source forces from another geographic combatant command, the Joint Staff will coordinate with that command prior to submitting the recommended solution.  ACC, in coordination with the Air Force Personnel Center Directorate of Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) Operations (AFPC/DPW), may also submit requests for reserve augmentation to the AFRC Force Generation Center for GFM and non-GFM backfill, in-place, rotational, and emergent requirements.  AFSOC forces are largely aligned to the Enabler Library; however, AFSOC  has  a  number  of  forces  (generally  those  forces  funded  by  other  than  Major  Force Program 11) that are included in the AEF system and are vulnerable to AEF tasking. 2.8.4.  Deploying Forces in Response to the RFF.  Once the RFF has been validated and a sourcing  solution  identified,  the  CJCS  certifies  and  releases  force  allocation  orders (DEPORD, PTDO, GFMAP Modifications, EXORD Modification) under the authority of the SecDef.  The force allocation orders will direct the losing CCDR to relinquish OPCON and the gaining CCDR to assume OPCON of the deploying force at a specific point in space or time,  but  generally  does  not  specify  command  relationships  below  the  CCDR.    Once  the orders  are  released,  the  CCDR  normally  determines  the  command  relationships  of  the inbound forces (usually, OPCON of SOF will be delegated to the TSOC, while other forces required  for  execution  of  the  SOF  mission  may  also  be  provided  OPCON  to  the  TSOC).  COMAFSOC  will  publish  G-Series  orders  for  expeditionary  units  to  which  deploying  Air Force  SOF  will  be  attached  and,  in  coordination  with  the  TSOC,  designate  a  COMAFSOF for the theater (if one is not already designated).  For AFSOC personnel deploying in support of  AEF  rotations,  the  theater  COMAFFOR  will  establish  the  units  to  which  the  deploying AFSOC personnel will be attached.   10  AFI10-410  26 JUNE 2015 Chapter 3 COMMAND AND CONTROL OF AFSOF 3.1.  Global  Commitment.  The  Air  Force  special  operations  mission  is  supported  by  global special  operations  command  and  control  networks  provided  by  USSOCOM,  AFSOC,  and  the TSOC commanders.  Expansion of this network is necessary during wartime, contingencies, and exercises to support an increase in operating locations and aircraft utilization rates.  United States European  Command  (USEUCOM)  and  Pacific  Command  (USPACOM)  have  permanently assigned  forces,  a  designated  Commander  of  Air  Force  Special  Operations  Forces (COMAFSOF), and a standing theater Joint Special Operations Air Component (JSOAC).  The other theaters are provided a designated COMAFSOF with the forces deployed to their AOR that is usually designated the JSOACC by the TSOC. 3.2.  SOF  Theater  Command  and  Control.  SOF  Command  and  Control  is  defined  in  Air Force Doctrine Annex 3-05, Special Operations.  TOD D.
