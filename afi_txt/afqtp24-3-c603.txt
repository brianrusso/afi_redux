The  operator  must  ensure  the  following  items  are checked after starting the Lavatory Service Truck and during operations.   Seven-Step Inspection Process Step 1.  Vehicle Overview 2.  Check Engine Compartment  Attachment 3 SEVEN-STEP INSPECTION PROCESS  Figure A3.1.  Seven-Step Inspection Process.  Procedure • o o o  Review the AF Form 1800. Ensure any discrepancy has been corrected. Vehicle Management annotated the discrepancy was completed. Approaching the vehicle. Damage or vehicle leaning to one side. Fresh leakage of fluids. Hazards around vehicle.   Note:  Check that the parking brakes are on and/or wheels chocked.  The operator may have to raise the hood, tilt the cab (secure loose things so they don't fall and break something), or open the engine compartment door. Note:  Engine will be turned off when checking these items. • o o o o  Windshield washer fluid level. o Check the following: Engine oil level. Coolant level in radiator; condition of hoses. Power steering fluid level; hose condition (if so equipped). Battery fluid level, connections and tie-downs (battery may be located elsewhere). Automatic transmission fluid level (may require engine to be running). Check belts for tightness and excessive wear (alternator, water pump, air compressor)--learn how much "give" the belts should have when adjusted right. o o   3.  Start Engine and Inspect Inside the Cab (Get in and Start Engine) o • • • • o o o o o o            Leaks in the engine compartment (fuel, coolant, oil, power steering fluid, hydraulic fluid, battery fluid). Cracked, worn electrical wiring insulation. Make sure parking brake is on. Put gearshift in neutral (or park if automatic).  Start engine; listen for unusual noises. If equipped, check the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) indicator lights.  Light on dash should come on and then turn-off.  If it stays on the ABS is not working properly. Look at the gauges. Oil pressure.  Should come up to normal within seconds after engine is started. Ammeter and/or voltmeter.  Should be in normal range(s). Coolant temperature.  Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. Engine oil temperature.  Should begin gradual rise to normal operating range. Warning lights and buzzers.  Oil, coolant, charging circuit warning, and antilock brake system lights should go out right away. Check Condition of Controls.  Check all of the following for looseness, sticking, damage, or improper setting: Steering wheel. Clutch. Accelerator (gas pedal). Brake controls. Foot brake. Parking brake. Transmission controls. Interaxle differential lock (if vehicle has one). Horn(s). Windshield wiper/washer. Lights.      • o • o     o • • • o o o o o o Headlights. Dimmer switch. Turn signal. Four-way flashers. Parking – clearance – identification – marker switch (switches). Check mirrors and windshield. Inspect mirrors and windshield for cracks, dirt, illegal stickers, or other obstructions to seeing clearly.  Clean and adjust as necessary. Check emergency equipment. Check for safety equipment: Properly charged and rated fire extinguisher.  Check for optional items such as: Chains (where winter conditions require). Tire changing equipment. List of emergency phone numbers Accident reporting kit (packet). Check safety belt. Check that the safety belt is securely mounted, adjusts; latches properly and is not ripped or frayed. Make sure the parking brake is set, turn-off the engine, and take the key with you.  Note:  Except during flightline operations. Turn-on headlights (low beams) and four-way emergency flashers, and get out of the vehicle. General. Go to front of vehicle and check that low beams are on and both of the four-way flashers are working. Push dimmer switch and check that high beams work.

Start the Engine and Check Test for Hydraulic Leaks • • • • • • • o o o o • o o o • • o o o o o Get in and turn-off all lights.  Turn-on stop lights (apply trailer hand brake or have a helper put on the brake pedal). Turn-on left turn signal lights. Get out and check lights. Left front turn signal light clean, operating and proper color (amber or white on signals facing the front). Left rear turn signal light and both stop lights clean operating, and proper color (red, yellow, or amber). Get in vehicle. Turn-off lights not needed for driving. Check for all required papers, trip manifests, permits, etc. Secure all loose articles in cab (they might interfere with operation of the controls or hit the operator in a crash). Start the engine. Test for hydraulic leaks. If the vehicle has hydraulic brakes, pump the brake pedal three times. Then apply firm pressure to the pedal and hold for five seconds. The pedal should not move.  If it does, there may be a leak or other problem. Brake system. Test parking brake. Fasten safety belt. Set parking brake (power unit only). Release trailer parking brake (if applicable).  Place vehicle into a low gear. Gently pull forward against parking brake to make sure the parking brake holds. Repeat the same steps for the trailer with trailer parking brake set and power unit parking brakes released (if applicable). If it doesn't hold vehicle, it is faulty; get it fixed. • o o o o o o • o o o o o o o • Test service brake stopping action. Go about 5 miles per hour. Push brake pedal firmly. "Pulling" to one side or the other can mean brake trouble. Any unusual brake pedal "feel" or delayed stopping action can mean trouble. If the trainee finds anything unsafe during the Vehicle inspection, get it fixed. Federal and state laws forbid operating an unsafe vehicle. The operator will annotate any findings on the AF Form 1800 and turn the vehicle into Vehicle Management for service if a leak is detected. Check vehicle operation regularly: Instruments. Air pressure gauge (if the vehicle has air brakes).  Temperature gauges. Pressure gauges. Ammeter/voltmeter. Mirrors. Tires. Cargo, cargo covers.  Lights, etc. If the trainee sees, hears, smells, or feels anything that might mean trouble, he/she should check it out. Document any discrepancy on AF Form 1800.  Sign-off AF Form 1800 to signify accomplishment of inspection.
