Overview.  Air  Force  manpower  is  a  critical  resource.    Manpower  must  be  properly identified  and  resources  allocated  to  ensure  the  Air  Force  has  the  capability  to  achieve  its peacetime and wartime missions.  To support national security objectives, Air Force units must successfully  accomplish  missions  using  the  optimal  level  of  manpower  that  includes  Active, Civilian, Air Reserve Component (ANG and USAFR) manpower resources and work that can be completed by private-sector contractor support.  The programming process is how the Air Force ensures commanders have the manpower resources to accomplish their assigned missions. 1.2.  Guiding  Principles.  Manpower guiding principles for requirements and programming are highlighted  in  DoDD  1100.4,  “Guidance  for  Manpower  Management,”  DoD  1100.22  “Policies and  Procedures  for  Workforce  Mix,”  AFPD  38-2  “Manpower,”  AFI  38-201,  “Management  of Manpower Requirements and Authorizations,” and provides guidance which must be considered when evaluating and executing programming decisions and activities. 1.2.1.  Manpower  is  a  constrained  resource  that  comprises  a  large  portion  of  the  Air  Force Budget.  All missions and programs compete for limited authorized military and civilian end-strength,  established grade distributions, and must  comply  with  other  guidelines as directed by Congress. 1.2.2.  Manpower resources must be programmed and allocated in a manner that contributes to  the  accomplishment  of  Air  Force  missions  in  priority  order,  and  commensurate  with available resources.  Changes to programs, missions, capabilities and/or functions will dictate changes  to  manpower  resources.    Private-sector  contract  support  programming  is  not addressed  in  this  AFI  and  should  be  managed  in  accordance  with  the  FAR  and  applicable SAF/AQ guidance. 1.2.3.  Manpower  must  be  programmed in  accordance  with  validated  manpower requirements,  and  within  fiscal  limits  and  acceptable  risk  identified  in  Defense  Planning Guidance (DPG). 1.2.4.  Military manpower and appropriated civilian resources will be allocated to  approved programs  by  Program  Element  (PE)  consistent  with  budget  submissions  and  Congressional direction.    Manpower  will  not  exceed  approved  levels,  violate  guidelines  established  by Congress, or violate other statutory limitations.  The civilian workforce shall be managed on the  basis  of  workload  and  fiscal  year  funding  except  where  imposed  by  Congress.    See Chapter 2 for additional information. is  programmed in  conjunction  with the  Air  Force  Planning, 1.3.  Events.  Manpower Programming,  Budgeting  and  Execution  (PPBE)  process  as  outlined  in  AFPD  16-5  Planning, Programming, Budgeting and Execution System and AFI 16-501 Control and Documentation of Air  Force  Programs.    Programmed  manpower  adjustments  typically  occur  during  four  major exercises  within the  PPBE  process;  1)  Baseline  Extension,  2)  Program  Objective Memorandum  (POM),  3)  Program  and  Budget  Review  (PBR),  and  4)  President’s  Budget (PB).   6  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 1.3.1.  The Baseline  Extension occurs after the President’s Budget is signed and marks the beginning  of  a  new  programmatic  cycle.    It  unlocks  a  new  programmatic  year  in  the programming database. 1.3.2.  Services  submit  a  POM  annually  to  Office  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  (OSD)  to frame their program proposals and associated changes to the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).    The  POM  includes  an  analysis  of  missions,  objectives,  alternative  methods  to accomplish objectives, and allocation of resources. 1.3.3.  The  PBR  enables  OSD,  Chairman  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (CJCS),  Combatant Commanders (COCOMs), and Joint Staff to assess the Air Force submission for compliance with the DPPG and other strategic guidance.  OSD issues Resource Management Decisions (RMDs) to the services to make programmatic changes or corrections as a result of the PBR. 1.3.4.  The  Service  submissions,  as  modified  by  OSD  RMD  decisions,  become  the Department  of  Defense  (DoD)  submissions  to  the  PB.    The  Office  of  Management  and Budget  (OMB)  incorporates  all  budget  submissions  from  all  executive  branches  and consolidates  them  into  the  PB  submission  to  Congress.    The  PB  is  presented  to  Congress annually no later than the first Tuesday in February. 1.3.5.  A description of PPBE systems and tools is provided at Attachment 2. 1.4.  Roles and Responsibilities. 1.4.1.  MAJCOMs/DRUs/FOAs  (NOTE:    Through  the  remainder  of  this  publication,  the term  “MAJCOM  and  equivalents”  will  be  used  to  generally  refer  to  entities  at  the organizational  level  represented  by  MAJCOMs,  DRUs,  and  FOAs),  Core  Function  Lead (CFL),  Headquarters  Air  Force  (HAF)  Mission  Panels  and  Program  Element  Monitors (PEM)  generate,  prioritize,  and  advocate  for  their  respective  manpower  initiatives,  offsets, and disconnects during a PPBE exercise. 1.4.2.  AF/A1M and AF/A1MP Roles and Responsibilities: 1.4.2.1.  AF/A1M  facilitates  all  end  strength  adjustments  made  during  a  PPBE  cycle  or event while serving as an advisor to the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). 1.4.2.2.  AF/A1MP compiles, records, allocates and administers the AF’s “top-line” end strength  changes  IAW  fiscal  year  AFCS  PPBE  decisions.    This  end  strength  includes Student, Trainee, and Personnel Hold (STP) accounts (i.e., Individuals accounts) and the Air  Force  portion  of  joint  defense  level  activities  and  accounts  centrally  managed  by OSD  and  ODNI  (see  special  considerations  outlined  in  Chapter  5).    AF/A1MP  will advocate for manpower resources in support of the Individuals (non-unit) account.  (See Chapter 8). 1.4.2.3.  AF/A1MP  assists  the  MAJCOMs,  CFLs,  HAF  Mission  Panels,  and  PEMs  in development  of  manpower  change  proposals  and  records  approved  changes  in  MPES. (See Attachment 3 for a description of MPES). 1.4.2.4.  AF/A1MP will ensure Total Force (TF) manpower adjustments are coordinated and  validated  by  the  respective  component  OPR;  namely  AF/REXX  (for  Reserve manpower issues) and NGB/A1MP (for National Guard manpower issues). AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   7  1.4.2.5.  AF/A1MP will coordinate manpower options affecting the acquisition workforce with SAF/AQH and SAF/AQX. 1.4.2.6.  AF/A1MP  will  co-chair  manpower  realignment  working  groups  with  AF/A8XI during the POM to address the sourcing and redistribution of manpower resources during AFCS deliberations and will facilitate sourcing of newly developed standards. 1.4.2.7.  AF/A1MP  is  responsible  for  providing  personnel  strength  for  Major  DoD Headquarter Activities in the AF FYDP and fiscal year budget exhibit submissions. 1.4.3.  AF/A1MR,  MAJCOM/A1Ms,  AFPC/MA  and  Manpower  Requirement  Squadrons (MRS) will assist with the validation of manpower requirement changes, as it relates to the quantification  of  offsets,  disconnects,  and  initiatives,  as  needed.    AF/A1M,  in  conjunction with  SAF/OS(M),  is  the  final  approval  authority  for  all  manpower  standards.    All requirements resulting from their application are considered valid.  (T-1).   8  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Chapter 2 DEFINING AND MANAGING AIR FORCE END STRENGTH 2.1.  Manpower  Resource  Accountability.  The  DoD  uses  program  elements  in  the  FYDP  to budget  for and control its resources.  An Air Force Program Element Code (PEC) accounts for resources, to include end strength, needed to provide a specific capability.  See Attachment 4 for a description of PEC attributes. 2.1.1.  Manpower Resource Identification Code (RIC).  An Air Force PEC may contain three manpower categories: officer, enlisted, and civilian for each component of the TF.  A list of commonly used RICs is at Attachment 5. 2.1.1.1.  Reserve and ANG end strength is further identified in the FYDP by RIC as Drill Officer, Drill Enlisted, and Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) Officer and Enlisted.  Air Force  Reserve  (AFR)  also  has  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee  (IMA)  Officer  and Enlisted. 2.1.1.2.  The  Civilian  category  contains  three  subcategories:    US  Direct  Hire  (USDH), Foreign  National  Direct  Hire  (FNDH),  and  Foreign  National  Indirect  Hire  (FNIH).  Memo entries are used to denote Guard and Reserve Technicians that are a subset of the USDH category. 2.2.  General Guidance. 2.2.1.  Military  active  duty  end  strength  levels  are  established  by  Congress.    As  such,  end strength  must  be  managed  within  congressional  limits.    During  AFCS  deliberations, manpower programming will adhere to OSD Fiscal Guidance and HAF Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR)/Annual Planning and Programming Guidance (APPG) direction. 2.2.2.  Civilian end strength,  is  not  limited by  congressional  restraints and will be managed solely on the basis of workload and fiscal year funding.  Civilian end strength is not normally subject  to  any  other  constraints  or  limits  in  terms  of  man-years,  full-time  equivalents  or ceilings unless specified by Congress. 2.2.2.1.  Guard and Reserve Technicians are exempt from  any  requirement  (imposed by law or otherwise) for reductions in DoD civilian personnel and shall only be reduced as part of military force structure reductions. 2.2.2.2.  Dollars (i.e., civilian pay) associated with reducing civilian end strength may be used during AFCS deliberations to offset bills in other areas, although caution should be used  with  AFRC/ANG  civilian  changes  due  to  limits  described  above  in  paragraph 2.2.2.1. 2.2.3.  MAJCOMs and equivalents  may make changes to  reimbursable  positions if agreed to  by  the  functional  OPR  and  SAF/FMBOP;  however,  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  cannot retain savings generated by these changes and cannot create costs for the Air Force. (T-1). 2.2.4.  End strength in PECs controlled by agencies and activities outside of the Air Force (e.g.,  DHP,  NIP,  joint  agencies)  cannot  be  changed  unless  OSD  has  approved  a  written agreement (e.g. Memo of Agreement) between the AF and the affected activity or directed in PBR decision document. AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   9  2.2.5.  End-strength  will  not  be  programmed  to  accommodate  cyclical  or  temporary requirements.    Instead  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  should  use  other  means  to  accomplish their short term missions or surge workloads: (T-1). 2.2.5.1.  Use  available  funds  and  command  civilian  employment  plans  to  employ civilians. 2.2.5.2.  Utilize  overtime,  temporary  full-time,  part-time,  or  over-hire  of  civilian personnel. 2.2.5.3.  Seek  support  from  the  AFRC/ANG  via  Military  Pay  Appropriation  (MPA) funds. 2.2.5.4.  Utilize temporary duty military and civilian personnel. 2.2.5.5.  Seek contract services.   10  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Chapter 3 PROGRAMMING TOOLS 3.1.  Estimating  Manpower  Requirements.  When  available,  manpower  estimates  will  be based  on  approved  crew  ratios,  LCOMs,  AF  manpower  standards,  Analysis  of  Alternatives (AoA),  command  guides  or  weapon  system  typical  tools.    For  new  and  emerging  missions, functional managers and manpower requirement experts will develop a manpower estimate. 3.2.  Weapon  System  Zero  Base  (ZB)  Procedures.  A  Weapon  System  ZB  is  designed  to optimize  allocation  of  operations  and  maintenance  manpower  end  strength;  first  within  a MAJCOM  mission  set  and  secondly  across  the  AF  FYDP.    Weapon  System  ZBs  match authorized/fielded  weapons  in  conjunction  with  annual  budget  cycles  and  produce  a  weapon system  typical  as  a  programming  tool  to  estimate  manpower  impacts  against  proposed  force structure changes.  A Weapon System ZB identifies all fixed (open-the-door costs) and variable costs (requirements as outlined in a typical) tied to a weapon system program element. Weapon System  ZBs  do  not  take  the  place  of  Program  Change  Requests  (PCRs)  or  funding  of  new requirements. 3.2.1.  General Guidance. 3.2.1.1.  Use the appropriate weapon system force structure contained in approved force tabs to populate the Primary Aircraft Inventory (PAI) for each location and Fiscal Year.  PAI  does  not  include  Backup  Aircraft  Inventory  (BAI)  or  Attrition  Reserve  Aircraft (AR); reference AFI 16-402 attachment 3, Aerospace Vehicle Inventory Relationships for further details. 3.2.1.2.  Use  the  most  recent  PB  FYDP  baseline  to  populate  a  weapons  system  ZB  for each system within the MAJCOM. 3.2.1.3.  Be aware that the combination of location, fiscal year timeline, and PAI numbers result in a classified (SECRET) report. 3.2.1.4.  AF/A1MP  will  identify  all  current  funded  LCOMs,  Force  Tabs,  and/or  other approved tools and methods to be utilized during the Weapon System ZB process. 3.2.1.5.  Use only approved Crew Ratio (CR) and Crew Composition (CC) stated in AFI 65-503, Table A36-1 or approved but not yet incorporated into AFI 65-503, US Air Force Cost  and  Planning  Factors  Table  A36-1.    CR  and  CC  do  not  apply  to  Flying  Training requirements. 3.2.1.6.  When  validating  Weapon  System  Security  (WSS)  requirements  and  multiple weapon  systems  are  parked  in  a  single  secure  parking  area,  the  primary  (predominant) weapon system pays for the WSS.  If there are additional parking areas required for other aircraft, those aircrafts’ PEs will pay for the additional WSS. 3.2.1.7.  When determining Wing overhead requirements, use the primary weapon system program element to account for the basic requirements (See Attachment 6).  If more than one weapon system exists at a location, the incremental overhead costs will be included in the secondary weapon system ZB requirements. 3.2.2.  Process. AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   11  3.2.2.1.  Fill  in  the  established  requirements  for  each  location  using  a  separate  Weapon System ZB template for each mission design series (A-10, C-130, C-17, F-16, F-15C/D, F-15E, etc.). 3.2.2.2.  Calculate crew requirements per squadron. 3.2.2.2.1.  Begin with the PAI for the specific squadron and multiply by the approved CR. 3.2.2.2.2.  If  a  fractional  number,  round  up  to  get  a  whole  number  of  crews  for  the squadron. 3.2.2.2.3.  Multiply the number of crews by each crew position type. CREW REQUIREMENT CALCULATION EXAMPLE Squadron A has 12 PAI with a CR of 3.0 and CC of 2 pilots and 1.5 loadmasters.   Step 1: Multiply the number of PAI by the CR to determine number of crews  Step 2: Multiply the number of crews by the CC  Calculation:  12 PAI X 3.0 CR =36 crews 36 X 2 pilots = 72 pilot 36 X 1.5 loadmasters = 54 loadmasters  Figure 1 3.2.2.3.  Validate  WSS  using  the  applicable  portion  of  the  approved  Security  Air  Force Manpower Standard (AFMS) and the base aircraft parking plan. 3.2.2.3.1.  Determine the number of secure areas that drive costs. 3.2.2.3.2.  Determine  which  weapon  systems  are  parked  in  each  area  to  identify  the appropriate  program  element  association(s).    Use  the  primary  weapon  system program  element  and  any  secondary  program  elements  that  drive  incremental manpower costs. 3.2.2.4.  Determine  Wing  overhead  requirements  using  AFCS  approved  and  funded AFMS (AF/A1MP will identify all AFMSs to be used). 3.2.2.5.  Identify  any  other  mission  requirements  (additive  or  subtractive),  and  private-contractor support if applicable, not addressed above such as Air Force Engineering and Technical  Services  (AFETS),  Factory  Acceptance  Teams,  Depot  Liaisons,  centralized engine/phase maintenance, etc. 3.2.2.6.  Identify the full time contributions made by an associate unit. 3.2.2.6.1.  Full Time Guard or Reserve within the association who primarily maintain or  repair  supplies  and  equipment  issued  to  the  Air  National  Guard  or  the  Air  Force   12  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Reserve will reduce the Active requirement one for one.  Once AD requirements have been reduced,  any subsequent  Guard or Reserve  changes to  their skills  or quantities must be coordinated with the respective AD MAJCOM prior to execution. 3.2.2.6.2.  Full Time Guard or Reserve within the association who primarily organize, administer, instruct, or train Air National Guard or Select Reserve members will not reduce the active requirement. 3.2.2.6.3.  Make no other adjustments for the associate’s part-time authorizations. 3.2.3.  Weapon System  ZB Upkeep and Maintenance.  The Weapon System ZB base is a “living”  document  and  should  be  updated  as  the  following  adjustments  occur:    AFCS approved force structure and associated manpower changes (i.e., Program Change Requests, Budget  Cycle  changes)  and/or  AFCS  approved  non-force  structure  related  actions  (i.e., update to an AFMS or LCOM). 3.2.3.1.  Within  60  days  after  the  PB  allocation  is  received  by  the  MAJCOMs  or equivalents, annotate any changes to the previous submitted requirement using a separate line item for each change. (T-1). 3.2.3.2.  Develop/update  a  weapon  system  typical  for  each  weapon  system.    A  typical identifies only the variable costs tied to standardized force structure (i.e. 18, 21, 24 PAI Fighter  Squadrons)  (See  template  at  Attachment  6).    Provide  updated  typicals  to AF/A1MP after completion and approval of the Weapons System ZB. 3.2.3.3.  The  typical  will  be  used  to  determine  the  manpower  impact  when  adjusting standardized force structure from an existing Wing with the same type of aircraft. 3.2.3.4.  To  develop/update  the  typical,  use  the  same  source  documents  as  used  for  the Weapon  System  ZB  requirements.    Identify  all  the  variable  manpower  requirements  to support the various standardized flying squadron force structure. 3.3.  Base  Support  Tail  (BST)  Factors.  Mission  and  capability  changes  affect  installation support  requirements;  therefore,  programmed  changes  in  mission  manpower  will  affect installation  support  manpower  requirements  and  may  impact  service  levels  for  private-sector contract  support.    The  relative  effect  of  these  changes  is  represented  as  AF  BST  factors  (see Attachment 7).  These BST factors are to be used in conjunction with other tools (see para 3.1) when determining manpower impacts of mission capability changes. 3.3.1.  The  BST  factor  estimates  the  incremental  impact  in  installation  support  manpower generated by a change in mission manpower requirements.  Its use assumes the presence of a full support infrastructure prior to making the proposed mission manpower changes. 3.3.2.  The different factors recognize required levels of support vary.  Refer to Attachment 7 to  determine  which  BST  factor  to  use.    These  factors  should  not  be  used  by  the  below MAJCOM  level  manpower  offices  to  make  adjustments  to  authorizations  on  the  Unit Manpower Document (UMD) based on mission and force structure changes without a change to programmed end strength. (T-1). 3.4.  Management Headquarters (MHQ) Factors.  If one or more MAJCOMs are involved in mission transfers/divestitures/increases and a mutual agreement cannot be reached by all parties with  respect  to  the  requisite  MHQ  manpower  adjustments,  AF/A1M  will  apply  an  engineered factor to determine these adjustments.  Any adjustments to MHQ manpower levels must be made AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   13  in accordance with the guidance in Chapter 5.  See Attachment 9 for an explanation of the MHQ factors. 3.5.  Individuals  Account  Manpower  Programming  Tools.  The  manpower  associated  with the  Individuals  Account  (see  Chapter  8  Figure  2)  is  quantified  through  the  development  and application  of  mathematical  models  to  identify  and  validate  Student  Man  Year  (SMY) requirements.    The  SMY  requirements  are  determined  by  multiplying  student  entry  data  and course  length,  and  then  dividing  the  result  by  the  average  number  of  academic  calendar  days.  The results  are programmed in  designated Program  Elements  by  AF/A1MP who is  responsible for developing and maintaining the SMY models.   14  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Chapter 4 ADJUSTING END STRENGTH 4.1.  AFCS  Change  Control  Number  (CCN).  Manpower  adjustments  identified  by  the MAJCOMs,  CFLs,  or  Mission  Panels  that  are  tied  to  changes  in  missions/capabilities  will  be documented  and  coordinated  via  an  AFCS  CCN  within  the  Resource  Allocation  Programming Information  Decision  System  (RAPIDS).   The  AFCS  CCN  records  approved  actions implementing  offsets,  disconnects  and  initiatives.    A  corresponding  Manpower  CCN  will  be created in MPES (see Attachment 3) for each approved AFCS CCN. 4.2.  Manpower  Zero  Balance  Transfer  (ZBT).  ZBTs  represent  manpower  adjustments  that are  not  tied  to  changes  in  missions/capabilities.    These  adjustments  are  designed  to  facilitate inter-command  transfers  and  to  correct  minor  deviations  in  program  execution  within  a  single command.    A  ZBT  is  an  exact  reallocation  of  resources,  normally  within  a  single  program.    A ZBT  is  not  to  be  used  for  reprogramming  actions  (i.e.,  transferring  resources  from  one mission/capability  to  another).    A  proposed  ZBT  that  realigns  manpower  between  PEs  that  in turn  changes  the  quantity  of  resources  within  a  budget  activity,  appropriation,  mission  panel and/or CFL’s portfolio, or from a Force and Infrastructure Code (FIC) perspective (e.g., Tooth-to-Tail)  will  require  coordination/acceptance  from  all  affected  stakeholders.    Manpower  ZBTs that are not cost neutral require coordination with SAF/FMB. 4.2.1.  General Guidance 4.2.1.1.  Manpower  ZBTs  must  not  increase  end  strength  (buy  end  strength  with  a funding  offset),  cross  appropriations,  or  create  costs  for  the  AF.    ZBTs  must  balance within each fiscal year and balance by manpower category, appropriation, and dollars.  If a ZBT is required to fix database errors from a previous programming event, the initiator must provide sufficient rationale. 4.2.1.2.  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  will  submit  ZBTs  to  AF/A1MP  manpower programmers at the same time all other ZBTs are submitted to AF/A8P.  (T-1). 4.2.1.3.  Manpower  actions  that  are  country/state  code  clean-up  actions  are  considered ZBTs. 4.2.1.4.  Inter-command  transfers  (ICT)  that  do  not  transfer  systems  are  considered manpower  only  ZBTs.    If  the  inter-command  transfer  is  the  result  of  weapon  system transfers, the action is not considered a pure manpower inter-command transfer and must be approved by mission panel.  (See paragraph 6.4.3 for guidance on UMD management with respect to pending ICTs). 4.2.1.5.  Manpower  actions  that  cross  appropriations,  end  strength  categories,  Budget Activities  (BA)  or  Budget  Subactivities  (BSA),  or  drive  a  cost  to  the  AFCS  are  NOT considered manpower ZBTs. 4.2.1.6.  AFRC/ANG Technician memo RICs (0163/0170) may be increased or decreased in a ZBT, however, their civilian RICs (0160) must zero balance. 4.2.2.  MAJCOM and Equivalent Roles and Responsibilities: AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   15  4.2.2.1.  The  gaining  and  losing  commands  coordinate  the  details  of  the  ZBT,  prepare their respective portions of the manpower ZBT MPES project, and submit it to AF/A1MP in MPES. (T-1). 4.2.2.2.  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  review  all  manpower  files  or  manpower  ZBTs before  submission  to  ensure  no  non-blue  positions  are  affected  (i.e.  SOCOM,  DHP,  or NIP.)  (T-1).  These will not be included in MAJCOM and equivalent ZBT actions. 4.2.2.3.  MAJCOMs and equivalents make changes to reimbursable positions if agreed to by the functional Office of Primary Responsibility (OPR) and SAF/FMBOP.  MAJCOMs and equivalents may not create ZBTs between reimbursable positions and direct-funded positions.  (T-1). 4.2.3.  AFCS (AF/A1MP, AF/REXX, NGB/A1MP) Roles and Responsibilities: 4.2.3.1.  AF/A1MP, AF/REXX, and NGB/A1MP manpower programmers will review all manpower ZBT requests for compliance with current POM Preparation Instruction (PPI) guidance. 4.2.3.2.  AF/A1MP,  AF/REXX,  and  NGB/A1MP  Programmers  will  work  non-compliance issues with affected MAJCOMs and Equivalents. 4.2.3.3.  AF/A1MP, AF/REXX and NGB/A1MP programmers will coordinate ZBTs with SAF/FMBOP  (or  appropriate  ARC  FM  office).    If  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  propose ZBT actions that result in added (unsourced) costs to the AF, they will be notified that the action is disapproved and will have the option to bring the action forward with an offset identified. 4.2.4.  Host  Tenant  Support  Agreements.  MAJCOM  and  equivalent  whose  initiatives impose  a  workload  on  other  MAJCOM  and  equivalents  must  coordinate  Host  Tenant Manpower Actions with the affected command.  (T-1) 4.2.4.1.  The supported command gives the supporting command the information it needs to determine its manpower requirements.  (T-1). 4.2.4.2.  The  supported  command  negotiates  with  the  supporting  command  regarding availability of existing resources to support the requirement.  (T-1). 4.2.4.3.  The  supported  command  programs  required  manpower  actions  in  the  first available exercise of the PPBE cycle after the support agreement has been finalized.  (T-1). 4.3.  Out  of  Cycle  End  Strength  Changes.  These  changes  include  program  change  requests (PCR) and Host Tenant Actions. 4.3.1.  A PCR is used to realign Air Force resources outside of the normal PPBE and consists of  changes  in  the  current  execution  and/or  budget  years  (BY).    Because  PCRs  require changing the Air Force Program  of Record, they  must be vetted through the AFCS process and approved by the Secretary of the Air Force (SECAF). 4.3.1.1.  Fiscal realignment approved as part of a PCR is typically finalized through Inter-Command Transfer (ICT) by SAF/FMBP.  An ICT is the realignment of funding between MAJCOMs and appropriations.   16  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 4.3.1.2.  Execution  or  Budget  year  changes  to  Force  Structure  items  are  tracked  within the Force Structure Data Management (FSDM) database (i.e. aircraft, munitions). 4.3.1.3.  Special oversight is required when reprogramming between appropriations, over specific funding level dollar thresholds, or special interest items involving congressional special interest line items.  HAF, OSD, or Congress can deny reprogramming actions of this nature. 4.3.1.4.  All  military  and  civilian  manpower  addressed  in  PCRs  must  zero  balance  and should consider required adjustments in private-sector contract support. 4.3.1.4.1.  If  a  PCR  proposes  manpower  changes,  it  must  be  broken  out  by  officer, enlisted,  and  civilian;  the  request  will  display  the  manpower  of  the  current  and proposed programs.  If the PCR proposes to change or transfer billets, the request will display the impact of these changes by category and fiscal year, including out years. 4.3.1.4.2.  If  the  request  is  to  change  manpower  only  (i.e.,  no  forces,  flying  hours, etc.) the requesting office should first consult AF/A1MP to see if the change can be reprogrammed via an ICT or other manpower change vehicle, without doing a PCR. AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   17  Chapter 5 ADJUSTING END STRENGTH- SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS 5.1.  Overview.  End  strength  levels  within  a  program  or  theater  may  be  dictated  or  limited  by legislative  and/or  OSD  policy.    These  constraints  include  ceilings/floors  (e.g.,  Overseas  and Management  Headquarters)  or  protected  budget  activities  whose  funding  levels  cannot  be adjusted without consent from the owning activity (e.g., DHP and SOF). 5.2.  Overseas  Ceilings/Floors.  U.S.  activities  in  foreign  countries  are  of  special  political  and economic interest to the U.S. and foreign governments.  OSD, working with higher authorities, establishes overseas ceilings/floors to control U.S. DoD activities in particular areas, regions, and countries.  Unless  HAF  or  a  higher  authority  specifies  otherwise,  overseas  manpower ceilings/floors include all permanent party military authorizations. 5.2.  The Executive Agent Roles and Responsibilities: 5.2.1.  AF/A1M and AF/A1MP Roles and Responsibilities: 5.2.1.1.  AF/A1M  designates  the  Manpower  office  within  the  Air  Force  component,  to the COCOM for the geographic area, as the Air Force executive agent. 5.2.1.2.  AF/A1MP notifies executive agents of ceiling/floor limitations. 5.2.2.1.  Administer and monitor the Air Force portion of the ceiling/floor. 5.2.2.2.  Notify  other  Air  Force  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  of  their  portion  of  the ceiling/floor. 5.2.2.3.  Ensure that MAJCOMs and equivalents don’t exceed ceiling/floor limits unless a higher  authority  so  authorizes.    MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  affected  by  manpower ceilings/floors ensure that UMD manpower authorizations do not exceed limitations.  See DoD  Financial  Management  Regulation,  Volume  2A  Chapter  1,  010110,  Combatant Command  Business  Rules  (Joint  Task  Assignment  Process  (JTAP))  for  adjusting  joint accounts for undistributed congressional and/or OSD general reductions.  (T-1). 5.2.2.4.  Ensures  that  limitations  provide  only  the  minimum  manpower  needed  for assigned missions. 5.2.3.  Executive  agents  and  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  may  directly  communicate  on ceiling/floor limitations.  Executive agents may directly communicate with the COCOM staff that controls the limitation they administer. 5.2.4.  Ceiling/Floor Change Requests. 5.2.4.1.  To  make  changes  to  an  Air  Force  ceiling/floor,  the  executive  agent  sends  a written explanation of the need to the appropriate COCOM, with an information copy to AF/A1MP. 5.2.4.2.  To increase/decrease a MAJCOM limitation, the MAJCOM or equivalent sends a  written  explanation  of  the  need  to  the  executive  agent,  with  an  information  copy  to AF/A1MP.  The executive agent approves the MAJCOM or equivalent request if it falls within the established Air Force limitation or disapproves if it falls outside of limitation.   18  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 5.3.  Major  DoD  Headquarters  Activities.  Management  headquarters  activities  are  described and  defined  in  DoDI  5100.73;  within  the  Air  Force,  manpower  in  management  headquarters organizations  will  be  sourced  from  specified  PECs.    Commands  are  expected  to  accommodate new  or  increased  workloads  from  within  existing  Major  DoD  Headquarters  Activities  end strength.  Any changes to the aggregate manpower total for a Major DoD Headquarters Activity or number of personnel  performing Major DoD Headquarters functions are limited to AFCS or PBR decisions. 5.4.  Joint Manpower.  COCOMs request new permanent joint manpower requirements via the Joint  Manpower  Validation  Process  (JMVP)  for  consideration  during  the  PBR.    The  JMVP employs Service Operations Deputies to  review associated mission drivers and capability  gaps.  Validated  requirements  are  presented  to  the  Joint  Manpower  Validation  Board  (JVMB)  to determine the correct size and characteristics (military/civilian, rank/grade and skill mix) of new billets  to  be  sourced.    Refer  to  CJCSI  1001.01A,  Joint  Manpower  and  Personnel  Program  for further guidance on managing Joint and COCOM end strength. 5.5.  Special  Access  Programs  (SAP).  AF/A1M  will  appoint  a  POC  to  support  manpower programming for Special Access Programs. 5.6.  Defense  Health  Programs.  AF/A1M  will  coordinate  DHP  manpower  programming changes with AF/SG1/8. 5.7.  Special Operations Forces (SOF).  AF/A1M will coordinate SOF manpower programming changes with HQ AFSOC/A1 and HQ USSOCOM/J1. 5.8.  Intelligence.  AF/A1M  will  coordinate  CCP  (BSA  330),  GDIP  (BSA  331),  FCIP  (BSA 335),  NGP  (BSA  336)  and  MIP  (BSA  365)  manpower  programming  changes  with  AF/A2R.  AF/A1M will coordinate NRP (BSA 333) manpower programming changes with NRO and HQ AFSPC/A1. 5.9.  Foreign  Military  Sales  (FMS).  AF/A1M  will  coordinate  FMS  manpower  programming changes with SAF/IA. AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   19  Chapter 6 MANPOWER ALLOCATION AND UMD EXECUTION 6.1.  Overview.  The  Directorate  of  Manpower  and  Organization,  Program  Development Division  (AF/A1MP)  allocates  programmed  manpower  resources  by  PEC,  RIC,  and  Country State  Code  (CSC)  to  the  commands  directing  implementation  of  approved  programs.  MAJCOMs  and  equivalents  translate  these  manpower  resources  into  manpower  authorizations by updating the UMD.  AF/A1MO provides the Air Force Personnel Center (AFPC) MPES data on military and civilian authorization changes to begin the actions necessary to recruit, train, and assign people.  Comparable detail is provided to AFR and Air National Guard (ANG) personnel organizations  by  their  respective  AFRC  and  ANG  manpower  organizations  so  they  may  also begin the actions necessary to recruit, train and assign personnel. 6.2.  General  Guidance.  Manpower  positions  will  be  added/deleted  from  the  UMD  effective the fiscal quarter of an associated mission change.  However, when a mission is extended one or more  fiscal  years,  the  MAJCOM/MAJCOM  equivalent  Manpower  and  Organization  (MO) division will submit a request to AF/A1MP to over/under-execute manpower on the MAJCOM UMD  to  match  the  mission  change  or  submit  the  requirement  through  the  AFCS  process  as  a program  disconnect.    AF/A1M  will  coordinate  these  requests  with  the  appropriate  HAF stakeholder.  See Attachment 8 for an example of an over/under execution request. 6.3.  Roles and Responsibilities 6.3.1.  AF/A1MP Roles and Responsibilities: 6.3.1.1.  Allocate manpower resources to the commands as required, typically at the end of each PPBE cycle, but making out-of-cycle allocations as necessary. 6.3.1.2.  Transmits  manpower  resources  to  the  commands  in  MPES.    Resources  are allocated  by  command,  CSC,  PEC,  and  RIC  for  all  fiscal  years  contained  within  the FYDP. 6.3.1.3.  Provide  guidance  regarding  which  fiscal  years  are  to  be  updated  on  the  UMD and when these UMD changes can be published. 6.3.2.  MAJCOM and Equivalent M&O Roles and Responsibilities: 6.3.2.1.  Review allocation from AF/A1MP. 6.3.2.2.  Using  MPES,  implement  changes  on  the  UMD  in  accordance  with  AF/A1MP instructions.  (T-1). 6.3.2.3.  Request extension or exception to timeline from AF/A1MP as required.  (T-1). 6.3.2.4.  Ensure authorizations on the UMD match total allocated FYDP by DoD PE.  (T-1). 6.3.2.4.1.  Deviations within military RICs of more than one half of one percent for a PE are non-compliant. 6.3.2.4.2.  Deviations  in  Civilian  RICs  of  more  than  one  half  of  one  percent  are allowable providing that the MAJCOM or equivalent is executing within its civilian work year allocation.   20  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 6.4.  MAJCOM UMD Management. 6.4.1.  Military  Manpower  Increases.    The  addition  of  military  manpower  authorizations  or changes to grades and skills are to be made effective no earlier than the current quarter plus two.  (T-1). 6.4.1.1.  For example, if the Manpower Change Request (MCR) was received in the first quarter of the year, the effective date of the approved change would be no earlier than the third quarter of that year. 6.4.1.2.  Deviations  from  this  time  phasing  must  be  coordinated  with  MAJCOM  and equivalent  Personnel  Directorate  activities  to  confirm  that  a  shorter  lead  time  will  not negatively impact the personnel assignments process.  (T-1). 6.4.2.  Manpower Reductions.  Make effective military and civilian manpower authorization reductions tied to workload and mission decreases per the higher authority’s direction (e.g., PAD, PGL, PPlan etc.) that eliminates the manpower requirement.  Reductions that are not related to the loss of a specific workload or mission take effect when a higher authority levies the reduction.  (T-1). 6.4.3.  Inter-command Transfer (ICT) of Functions and Related Authorizations.  Since ICTs often  involve  manpower  realignment  among  Major  Force  Programs  (MFP),  the  constraints associated  with  crossing  budget  appropriations  and  MFPs  may  limit  timing  of  civilian realignments among DoD program elements.  Therefore, losing and gaining commands must work closely together to facilitate these transfers. 6.4.3.1.  Once inter-command transfer negotiations begin, the losing command no longer adjusts  manpower  authorizations  on  the  UMD  in  the  functions  proposed  for  transfer.  Also, the losing command must provide an associated manpower display for the two-year period before the proposed transfer date.  (T-1). 6.4.3.2.  Manpower quantities will be based on the losing command’s funded manpower authorizations as of the 4th quarter for each fiscal year. 6.4.3.3.  To  prevent  duplicate  end-strength  reporting,  manpower  authorization  transfers between commands should be completed within MPES during the same month, and with the same effective date.  (T-1). AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   21  Chapter 7 MANPOWER DATA SYSTEMS, REPORTING, AND PROGRAM EVALUATION 7.1.  Overview.  AF/A1M is responsible for supporting and maintaining MPES, the Air Force’s authoritative data source for manpower requirements and resources for the Active, ANG, AFR, and Civilian workforces.  (See Attachment 3 for additional MPES component and data element information)    In  addition,  AF/A1M  ensures  systems  interfaces  continue  between  MPES  and other  Automated  Information  Systems that  support  manpower  programming,  resource management,  and  internal  HAF  studies  and  reviews  (e.g.  RAPIDS,  ABIDES,  E-JMAPS).    In support  of  AFCS  Budget  Development  and  congressional  reporting,  AF/A1MP  extracts, aggregates, and abridges manpower data from the system to provide various reports and products for  multiple  stakeholders  to  include:    OSD,  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff  (JCS),  CFL,  HAF  Mission Panels,  SAF/FM,  and  AF/A8.    In  addition,  AF/A1MP,  MAJCOM  and  equivalent  M&Os,  and COCOM  M&Os  utilize  MPES  to  manage,  coordinate  and  execute  MAJCOM,  MAJCOM equivalent,  and  Joint  manpower  programming  actions.    Finally  AF/A1MP  in  conjunction  with AF/A1MO  compares  FYDP  and  UMD  data  to  evaluate  AF  Manpower  Program  execution  and adherence to end strength levels. 7.2.  AF/A1MP  Roles  and  Responsibilities  -  Budget  Development  and  OSD/Congressional Reporting. 7.2.1.  Transmit  all  manpower  programming  files  (Active  Duty,  Civilian,  Reserve,  and Guard) to SAF/FM. 7.2.2.  Prepare  budget  exhibits  for  inclusion  in  SAF/FM  Justification  Books  (J-Books) submission to OSD and Congress to explain and defend AF end strength.  (Annual) 7.2.3.  Produce  Defense  Manpower  Requirements  Report  (DMRR)  exhibits  and  narratives describing  Air  Force  manpower  requirements,  force  structure,  and  end  strength  for  the reported budget years for SAF/MR approval and submittal to OSD and Congress.  (Annual) 7.2.4.  Provide  input  for  Congressional  Force  Structure  Announcements  (FSA),  describing the  AF  planned  weapon  system  and  manpower  changes  for  the  upcoming  FY.    This  is typically done in conjunction with submission of that FY PB.  (Annual) 7.2.5.  Review FYDP against OSD Comptroller Information System (CIS) at the end of each POM and PB exercise.  (Semi-Annual) 7.2.6.  Build  military  and  civilian  Exercise  Drivers  following  POM  and  PB  exercises  to include Exercise Drivers for Release that roll up comprehensive drivers to reflect the largest programmatic and RMD actions.  (Semi-Annual) 7.2.7.  Build AF TF Manpower Profiles upon POM and PB closeout.  (Semi-Annual) 7.2.8.  Develop Skill Projections to extrapolate AFSC and grade requirements from projected PE  changes  to  predict  impact  of  PPBE  approved  actions  on  skills  and  grades  for  AF/A1PF who  requires  AFSC  detail  of  programmed  manpower  changes  across  the  FYDP  in  order  to revise Career Field Sustainment profiles.  This information is then used to develop the AF’s Force  Management  program  to  ensure  the  force  is  sized  and  shaped  within  authorized  end strength; it also forms the basis for AF’s recruiting and retention programs/strategy.   22  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 7.2.9.  Develop  and  update  Student  Man  Year  Models  to  extrapolate  student  and  trainee requirements to predict impact of PPBE approved actions on Initial Skills Training (IST). 7.3.  AF/A1MP  Roles  and  Responsibilities  –  MAJCOM  and  Equivalent  Manpower Programming. 7.3.1.  Build  and  load  projects  reflecting  AFCS  “Yes”  decisions  and  OSD  approved/signed RMDs/DDDs/5Ds in MPES. 7.3.2.  Program  SAF/AAR  and  Air  Force  District  of  Washington  (AFDW)  manpower programming actions in MPES. 7.3.3.  Prepare  budget  exhibits  on  Management  Headquarters,  reimbursable,  and  non-reimbursable Air Force military outside the department. 7.4.  AF/A1MP Roles and Responsibilities - Joint Manpower Programming. 7.4.1.  Act as AF/A1M POC for Defense-level activities and accounts activities; coordinates Joint  Table  of  Distribution  (JTD)  change  and  MPES  changes  with  Career  Field  Managers (CFM). 7.4.2.  Coordinate on MOAs and execute fiscal year PBR decisions. 7.5.  AF/A1MP Roles and Responsibilities – Manpower Program Evaluation. 7.5.1.  Conduct FYDP and UMD Compare. 7.5.1.1.  The FYDP/UMD compare is a resource accountability report which displays the budget manpower data (FYDP) in parallel with the executed manpower data (UMD) from MPES. 7.5.1.2.  This  comparison,  across  the  FYDP,  is  accomplished  using  the  common  fields between the two modules of MPES - Command ID (CID), Resource Identification Code (RIC), Program Element Code (PEC), and Country-State Code (CSC). 7.5.1.3.  The report is managed by the Business Objects Analyst and access is available to all Secure Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) MPES users. 7.5.1.4.  Monthly,  a  snapshot  of  UMD  data  is  captured  using  Business  Objects  and imported  over  from  the  Nonsecure  Internet  Protocol  Router  (NIPR)  to  SIPR  MPES environment. 7.5.1.5.  This  static  UMD  data  is  aligned  with  current  allocated  FYDP  data  using  a prebuilt Business Objects report.  Depending on the user's level of access in MPES, data visibility to this report is restricted to commands (MAJCOM users) or all Air Force (HAF Programmer and HAF Budget Developers). 7.5.2.  FYDP and UMD Program Evaluation. 7.5.2.1.  AF/A1MP  will  periodically  review  MAJCOM  FYDP  versus  funded  UMD execution in order to prepare for the next POM and to inform the MAJCOMs and AFCS of  disconnect  and  offset  opportunities.    AF/A1MP  will  advise  MAJCOMs  when  these reviews  are  underway  and  will  seek  their  input  on  reconciling  any  anomalies.    This periodic  assessment  will  also  account  for  approved  over/under  execution  actions  (see AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   23  paragraph  6.2).    The  FYDP  and  UMD  evaluation  will  normally  be  conducted  in  the following order: 7.5.2.2.  Command:    A  comparison  of  a  command’s  total  officer,  enlisted,  civilian allocated FYDP to present and future year UMD execution levels. 7.5.2.3.  Force  and  Infrastructure  Code  (FIC):    A  comparison  of  FYDP  and  UMD  by families  of  PECs.    These  comparisons  will  isolate  execution  of  forces  versus infrastructure  (or  tooth-to-tail)  as  well  as  the  various  subsets  of  infrastructure  programs such as: headquarters, medical and training. 7.5.2.4.  Program Element (PE):  A detailed comparison of each individual program.   24  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Chapter 8 INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNT - STUDENTS, TRANSIENTS AND PERSONNEL HOLDEES (STP) PROGRAM 8.  1.  Overview.      The  Air  Force  STP  Program  provides  a  deliberate  and  defendable methodology  to  develop,  program,  and  execute  the  Individuals  Account  as  outlined  in  DoD Instruction  1120.11,  Programming  and  Accounting  for  Active  Military  Manpower.    The supporting manpower (i.e., Training units) includes instructors, recruiters, overhead and support manpower and is not part of the Individuals accounts. 8.2.  Roles and Responsibilities. Figure 2 8.2.1.  AF/A1M:  Serves as the AF OPR for the Individuals Accounts and determines, justifies, defends, and plans its manpower programming.  Determines the criteria by which AFPC collects and reports Individual manpower requirements data.  Serves as the manpower program manager for the Individuals Accounts.  Ensures centrally managed Individuals manpower and supporting manpower is developed and funded in relationship to adjustments in overall AF accession levels. 8.2.2.  AF/A1P:  Develops  and  implements  personnel  policy  and  procedures  in  support  of Individuals  accounting  requirements.    Provides  Program  Guidance  Letter  (PGL)  data  on trained personnel requirements for officer and enlisted.  Coordinates with AF/A1M to ensure centrally managed STP manpower and supporting manpower is adjusted to meet changes in initial skills pipelines (Officer/Enlisted Initial Skills Program Guidance Letters).  The Student Man-Year (SMY) cost to implement these PGLs should not exceed funded levels. 8.2.3.  AF/A1D:    Coordinates  with  AF/A1M  to  ensure  STP  manpower  and  supporting manpower  is  adjusted  to  meet  changes  in  Graduate  Education  and  Professional  Military Education.  The SMY cost to implement these programs should not exceed funded levels. 8.2.4.  AF  Career  Field/Functional  Managers:  Coordinates  with  AF/A1M  to  ensure  STP manpower  and  supporting  manpower  is  adjusted  to  meet  changes  in  Initial  Skills  Training (IST)  pipeline  and  course  lengths.    The  SMY  cost  to  implement  new  pipeline  or  course requirements should not exceed funded levels. 8.2.5.  AFPC/DPA/DSY:  Develops and maintains personnel data practice and procedures to support accurate accounting of members in Individuals status.  Ensures personnel Functional Category coding is in compliance with the Individuals Account program funding established by  AF/A1M.

Gives AF/A1M Permanent Change of Station (PCS) AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   25  move  requirements  and  other  functions  required  for  development  of  Transient,  Personnel Holdee, Patient, and Separatee account man-years.  (T-1). 8.2.6.  AFPC/MA:    Serves  as  the  link  between  AF/A1M  and  AFPC/DPA/DSY  to  develop Personnel  Holdee  Factors  and  Transient  average  move  days  based  on  AF/A1MP  criteria.  Evaluates Personnel Holdee and Transient movement data supplied by AFPC/DPA/DSY. 8.2.7.  AETC/A1:  Monitors, assesses and balances impacts to Individuals requirements when course  or  pipeline  adjustments  are  made  through  the  AF  Education  and  Training Development  program.    Provides required  course or pipeline level  data, to include Student, Instructor,  Overhead,  or  Base  Operating  Support  changes  to  AF/A1MP  for  training  and education  programming  requirements.    AETC/A1/A3  is  responsible  to  ensure  pipeline  and course  adjustments  are  not  implemented  until  STP  manpower  is  fully  funded  by  the appropriate  lead  stake  holding  Command  or  CFM.    AETC/A1M/A3  will  notify  AF/A1MP upon  the  approval  and  implementation  of  any  training  adjustments  to  Initial  Skills  pipeline and course adjustments. 8.3.  STP (Individuals) Account Categories. 8.3.1.  Students.  Students shall include all active military personnel who are attending non-initial entry courses of instruction in a PCS status (normally a combined course length of 20 weeks  or  more  at  one  location)  or  in  a  temporary  duty  status  while  executing  a  PCS.  Members in a TDY-to-school out-and-back status from a permanent party assignment are not considered in this category.   The corresponding Man-Years are a product of course length, number of entries, attrition rate and training days per year. 8.3.2.  Trainees (Enlisted Trainees and Officer Accession Students).  Enlisted trainees and officer  accession  students  shall  include  those  active  duty  enlisted  and  officer  military personnel  who  have  not  completed  Initial  Skills  entry  training    This  also  includes  enlisted trainees who enter Officer Training School or the USAF Prep School following active duty enlistment.  Officer accession student training includes officer basic courses and all IST and proficiency training taken prior to travel to the member’s first permanent duty station.  Initial entry training includes all in-transient time from entry on active duty until completion of the last  IST  course  of  instruction.    All  members  reporting  to  their  first  permanent  duty  station and  subsequently  attend  IST  are  not  considered  as  trainees.    Members  in  a  TDY-to-school out-and-back status  from  a permanent  party assignment are not  considered in  this category.  The corresponding Man-Years are a product of course length, number of entries, attrition rate and training days per year. 8.3.3.  Cadets.  Cadets shall include all cadet wing members of the U.S. Air Force Academy.  Members  of  the  USAFA  Prep  School  are  not  considered  in  this  category,  but  should  be included  in  the  Student  category.      The  corresponding  Man-Years  are  computed  by  using three years of historical data provided by AFPC. 8.3.4.  Transients.  Transients  comprise  all  military  personnel  in  travel,  proceed,  leave enroute or temporary duty (TDY) enroute on PCS orders to execute an accession, separation, training,  rotational  or  operational  moves.    The  corresponding  Man-Years  are  computed  by using three years of historical data provided by AFPC. 8.3.5.  Personnel  Holdees.  Holdees  shall  include  military  members  who  are  dropped  from the assigned strength of a force structure unit and attached to a “holding” activity because of   26  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 medical  non-availability,  disciplinary  non-availability,  or  pre-separation  non-availability.  The corresponding Man-Years are computed by using three years of historical data provided by AFPC. 8.3.6.  Holdees  -  Patients.  Military members will remain assigned to their units when they are projected to heal, recover, and return to full duty within 180 days of the original injury or illness.    Military  members  may  be  reassigned  or  attached  to  a  medical  holding  detachment (e.g. a Warrior Transition Unit) and counted as Individual strength when they have complex medical  needs  requiring  extended  hospitalization,  treatment,  recovery,  and/or  rehabilitation or their eventual return to duty is unlikely. 8.3.7.  Holdees - Prisoners.  A military member shall be reassigned to a holding detachment or  to  a  disciplinary  status  and  included  in  Individual  strength  when  the  member  has  been convicted by military or civilian court and sentenced to  confinement of 30 days or more or the member is awaiting disposition after having returned to military control from a dropped-from-strength status. 8.3.8.  Holdees – Separatees.  Active military members who must be reassigned to a transfer activity  or  some  other  separation  activity  to  undergo  separation  out-processing  or  to  await administrative discharge shall be accounted for as separatees in the Individuals strength.

Overview.  The  Air  Force  relies  on  various  tools  and  databases  to  meet  its  PPBE responsibilities and resource allocation objectives. A2.2.  Future Years Defense Program (FYDP).  FYDP is an OSD database method/record for documenting  future  projections  of  resources  (funding,  manpower,  and  forces)  over  five  years (the FYDP). A2.2.1.  The  OSD  Comptroller  Information  System  (CIS)  is  the  official  DoD  database  that captures  the  total  DoD  FYDP.    CIS  contains  a  detailed  compilation  of  the  total  resources (forces, manpower, and dollars) programmed for DoD and arranged by Major Force Program (MFP) and appropriation. A2.2.2.  The Air Force provides updated data to OSD at two specified times during the year: upon  submission  of  the  Air  Force  Program  Objective  Memorandum  (POM)  for  Program Budget Review (PBR) and upon finalization of the President‘s Budget (PB) at the OSD level. A2.2.3.  The Air Force maintains a duplicate of OSD CIS, known as the Force and Financial Plan (F&FP), which projects Air Force resources across the FYDP. A2.2.4.  ABIDES  and  the  Resource  Allocation  Programming  Information  Decision  System (RAPIDS) are the two primary database systems that support the development of the POM and Service budget submission. A2.3.  The Automated Budget Interactive Data Environment Systems (ABIDES).  ABIDES is  the  classified  database  that  hosts  the  Air  Force’s  Force  and  Financial  Plan  (F&FP)  and  the Options  Development  System  (ODS)  which  is  a  database  for  all  recommended  FYDP adjustments. A2.3.1.  SAF/FM is responsible for managing the ABIDES budgeting database. A2.3.2.  SAF/FMP  administers  the  Options  Development  System  (ODS)  portion  of  the ABIDES that has been set aside to support options development by the AFCS. A2.3.3.  The ODS enables programmers to submit proposed FYDP adjustments for decision by  the  AFCS.    Multiple  options  may  exist  for  each  program.    The  system  is  classified SECRET. A2.4.  Resource  Allocation  Programming  Information  Decision  System  (RAPIDS).  The Panels  rely  on  PEMs,  functional  staffs,  Capability  Champions,  MAJCOMs,  Direct  Reporting Units  (DRUs),  and  Field  Operating  Agencies  (FOAs)  for  cost  estimates  and  an  operational perspective.  The Panels develop options and forward their inputs to the Database and Exercise Teams in SAF/FMP in the form of RAPIDS data. A2.4.1.  RAPIDs is a software tool used by all Air Force programmers to create options for presentation  to  senior  leadership  and  create  electronic  data  files  for  transmittal  to  ABIDES data systems.  Options do not become part of the Air Force Program, even though they have been approved by the AFCS, until they are entered into the data systems that contain the Air Force F&FP.  The following methods are used for tracking: AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   33  A2.4.1.1.  Change Control Number (CCN) is assigned to each option under consideration by  a  Panel.    This  CCN  is  the  common  data  thread  used  in  the  various  programming databases and tools to ensure all the pieces of the option are tracked and priced together. A2.4.1.2.  Workstation  and  Decision  Tracker  are  the  key  applications  in  RAPIDS.    The Workstation module is used to capture justification, baseline data, and proposed funding adjustments  for  each  programmatic  initiative  submitted  to  the  AFCS  for  funding consideration.  The  Decision  Tracker  module  is  used  to  display  options  and  track decisions made by senior leadership through the Air Force Corporate Structure (AFCS). A2.4.2.  RAPIDS Development and Processing. A2.4.2.1.  SAF/FMP collects the initial RAPIDS data from the Panels, creates the initial RAPIDS  Decision  Tracker  summary,  and  populates  the  "brief  options"  file  in  ABIDES (ODS). A2.4.2.2.  Using RAPIDS Decision Tracker and  RAPIDS  slides, the AFCS reviews and approves or disapproves the proposed adjustments. A2.4.2.2.1.  Following  each  programmatic  exercise,  SECAF-approved  options  are priced  via  the  ABIDES  cost  model  and  associated  financial  data  is  automatically loaded into ABIDES F&FP.  Panel Weapon System programmers load force structure adjustments  into  the  Program  Data  System;  the  system  of  record  for  resources  (e.g. aerospace  vehicle  authorizations,   Manpower programmers  load  end  strength  changes  into  MPES,  the  system  of  record  for manpower. inventory,  and  flying  hours). A2.4.2.2.2.  Extracts  from  PDS  and  MPES  are  used  to  update  each  program’s  force structure and manpower data in ABIDES. A2.5.  Manpower  Programming  and  Execution  System  (MPES)-FYDP.    MPES-FYDP  is  a resource  accounting  and  management  information  system  that  supports  the  Directorate  of Manpower, Organization, and Resources.  MPES-FYDP is a classified data system and program of record for all F&FP manpower data and as such processes and transmits manpower allocation resource  data  to  the  MAJCOMs,  allowing  resource  accounting  and  management  information system that supports the M&O function at all levels. (See Attachment 3)    34  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Attachment 3 MANPOWER PROGRAMMING AND EXECUTION SYSTEM (MPES)  A3.1.  Overview.  MPES is  the  family  of applications  that supports: manpower budgeting, unit manpower  requirements,  personnel  and  position  management,  manpower  modeling,  and reporting and analysis for the Active, ANG, AFR, and civilian workforce.  It is the authoritative data source for all funded AF end strength and associated PPBE manpower changes.  MPES is used  to  populate  the  AF  manpower  budget  that  is  contained  in  ABIDES.  For  information  on ABIDES and other PPBE systems, see Attachment 2. A3.2.  MPES  Components.  The  MPES  family  of  systems  includes  four  components:  1)  the FYDP  application;  2)  the  UMD,  3)  the  MPES  Grade  Allocation  Module  (MGAM);  and  4)  a Business Objects analysis tool. A3.3.  The FYDP Component.  Used to create and manage the Air Force TF manpower budget for future years and interfaces with the official Air Force budget system (i.e., ABIDES).  Within the  application,  specific  Manpower  Change  Control  Numbers  (MCCN)  and  CCNs  are  used  to validate manpower requirement changes.  Manpower requirement  changes are then loaded into the system according to validated PE requirements and projected funding. A3.4.  FYDP Key MPES Data Elements. A3.4.1.  CC.:    A  CCN  is  assigned  to  an  initiative,  offset,  or  disconnect  option  under consideration.  CCNs are used in all the various PPBE databases and tools to ensure all the pieces of the option are tracked and priced together.  One primary function of the CCN is to enforce  accountability  and  input  control  of  the  database.    The  author  of  the  CCN  must  be consulted before any changes are made. A3.4.2.  Command Identifier (CID).  An attribute used to represent the MAJCOM, FOA,  or DRU that will receive the manpower resource allocation for the authorization. A3.4.3.  Manpower Change Request  (MCR).  Consists of the following:   2-digit Command, 4-digit  Exercise,  and  4-digit  Sequence  MCCN;  MCCN  consists  of  the  following:    1st character = Major Force Program, 2nd character = last digit of exercise year, 3rd character = type  of  exercise,  4th  and  5th  characters  =  “super-tracking”  (not  the  same  as  STEM  / SUPERTRACK), and the 6th, 7th and 8th Characters are open to programmers discretion. A3.4.4.  Program Element Code (PEC).   This element is directly related to a parent Program Element with cost data related to a weapon system or support function as shown in the USAF Force and Financial Program (see attachment 4).  MAJCOM and equivalent requests for new PECs will be reviewed by AF/A1MP. A3.4.5.  Resource Identification Code (RIC).  This attribute identifies categories of resources such as Treasury Code for funds, component and category of personnel  for manpower,  and type of unit for forces.  Each RIC has only one appropriation; the RIC is a four-position code which identifies the type of resources assigned to each PE (see attachment 5). A3.4.6.  Country  State  Code  (CSC).    The  values  for  states  within  the  continental  United States  will  be  numbers.    All  other  will  be  letters  and/or  numbers.    In  the  current  system, Country  State  Codes  do  contain  numbers  and  letters;  for  example,  AC  is  the  code  for Antigua, C3 is the code for Eastern Europe, etc. AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   35  A3.5.  The  UMD  Component.  The  UMD  provides  Total  Force  position  management  and interfaces with other DoD and Air Force systems. A3.5.1.  The primary function of the MPES UMD Component is to provide United States Air Force  (USAF)  manpower  professionals  the  ability  to  define  and/or  adjust  authorized  end strength within the service. A3.5.2.  Every  validated  manpower  requirement  within  the  USAF  has  a  corresponding 'record' called a "position" within the MPES UMD framework. A3.5.3.  Position  records,  hereafter  referred  to  as  positions;  contain  many  pieces  of information about each position. A3.5.4.  Many  of  these  pieces  of  information,  referred  to  as  attributes,  are  interdependent with other attributes. A3.5.5.  Some  attributes  must  be  contained  in  all  positions;  others  can  have  complex relationships with several other attributes. A3.5.6.  The relationships can be based on many aspects of the position.  The business rules and  necessary  characteristics  for  each  of  these  attributes  are  contained  below  in  the  UMD Key Data Elements section. A3.5.7.  UMD Management of related positions is accomplished through the use of projects.  A project is a construct that allows manpower professionals to create, modify or delete a set of  positions.    These  positions  are  manipulated  by  manpower  professionals  to  accurately reflect the current and future authorized requirements for the Air Force. A3.6.  UMD Key Data Elements. A3.6.1.  Personnel Accounting Symbol Code (PAS Code).  Is used to identify Air Force units; all  manpower  resources  are  organized  and  assigned  to  units.    The  value  stored  for  this attribute  links  the  manpower  record  to  the  organization  record  contained  in  the  reference table.  Manpower data is normally associated to the current PAS record. A3.6.2.  Functional  Account  Code  (FAC).    Is  used  to  identify  functions  down  to  the  basic work  center.    The  first  four  digits  are  controlled  by  AF/A1M;  the  last  two  digits  are MAJCOM-controlled and are used to identify command-peculiar work centers. A3.6.3.  Program Element Code (PEC).  See paragraph 8.3.3.4 and attachment 4. A3.6.4.  Resource Identification Code (RIC).  See paragraph 8.3.3.5 and attachment 5. A3.6.5.  Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC).   This attribute is  required for all positions,  and may be different than the Required Air Force Specialty Code (RAFSC).  It combines the Air Force  Specialty  and  the  Air  Force  Specialty  suffix  into  a  single  code.    The  values  for attributes  can  be  found  in  the  Officer  and  Enlisted  Classification  Directory.    It  is  used  to represent a specific military occupational specialty, skill, or qualification. A3.6.6.  Manpower  Type  (MNT)  Code.   This  5-digit  attribute  identifies  manpower requirements  by  their  funding,  utilization,  work  status,  contract  equivalent  and  category status.  If the first digit is “X” the UMD requirement is funded; an “R” denotes unfunded and “N” denotes a non-FYDP requirement.    36  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Attachment 4 ATTRIBUTES OF A PROGRAM ELEMENT A4.1.  Overview.    The  Program  Element  (PE)  is  the  primary  data  element  in  the  Future  Year Defense Program (FYDP) and is the foundation of the PPBE Process.  Each program and entity within the defense portfolio has its own PE and is the specific allocation of resources for those entities from the Secretary of Defense.  PEs are designed and quantified to be comprehensive and mutually  exclusive.  They  may  be  aggregated  in  a  variety  of  ways:    To  display  total  resources assigned  to  a  specific  program.    To  display  weapons  systems  and  support  systems  within  a program.    To  select  specified  resources.    To  display  logical  groupings  for  analytical  purposes.  To identify selected functional groupings of resources A4.2.  PE  Structure.    PEs  consists  of  a  seven-digit  number  with  an  alphabetical  suffix  that identifies  a  program,  organization  or  office.    The  first  two  digits  identify  the  Major  Force Program (MFP) that contains the PE (e.g., the PE "0203123A" would indicate an Army program within  MFP  2  -  General  Purpose  Forces).    The  alphabetical  suffix  identifies  the  Service  or Defense  Agency  that  has  cognizance  over  a  particular  program  element.    For  example,  "A" indicates an Army program, "F" an Air Force program, "N" a Navy program and "M" a Marine Corps  program.    This  PE  structure  facilitates  compilation  of  the  FYDP  for  different  purposes, such as an appropriation review. A4.2.1.  A  PE  exists  at  three  levels:    OSD,  the  Air  Force  program,  and  the  Air  Force manpower  shred.    Each  attribute  provides  key  information  to  OSD,  the  AFCS,  and  the Programming  Agency.    Each  attribute  describes  the  resources  needed  (dollars,  people,  and equipment) to support a specific activity. A4.2.2.  OSD Program Element Code (PEC) / Program Element (PE): The Service is denoted by a single letter (F = Air Force).  EXAMPLES: OSD Program Element Code: 8 digits (ex. 0401896F – Base Operations Airlift)  Service Program Element: 6 digits (ex. 41896F Base Operations – Airlift)  A4.2.3.  Manpower PEC:  Uses a function code in lieu of “F” agency code [examples below] 41896A Base Operations-Airlift 41896B Base/Transient Aircraft Maintenance 41896D Manpower and Organization 41986S Combat Operations Staff 41896U Operation of Utilities 41896V Other Engineering Services A4.3.  Building blocks of the AF PEC. A4.3.1.  Major  Force  Programs  (MFPs)  are  numeric  mission  area  divisions  of  the  DoD program and budget.  MFPs help DoD look at major mission areas across Service lines.  Each PE is a subset of only one of 11 MFPs (ex. 0401896F – Base Operations Airlift).  See MFP Table.  NOTE:  Manpower Program Element Code shreds do not follow a prescribed pattern. A4.3.2.  Generic Air Force PEs, each 0 is dropped (for MFP 10 and 11, use “a” and “b” and the “F” are dropped) (ex. 41896 – Base Operations Airlift). AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   37  A4.3.3.  Special categories: All **969 PE denote a combat support type element. (ex. 41969 – Airlift Combat Support)  See Shred for more details. All ***98 PEs denote a Headquarters element.  (ex. 41898H – HQ AMC special) A4.3.4.

Attachment 7 BASE SUPPORT TAIL (BST) FACTORS A7.1.  Overview.  The BST factor is  a programming tool that estimates the incremental  impact on installation support (IS) manpower generated by a change in mission manpower requirements.  The  BST  factors  were  developed  from  correlation  and  regression  analysis  of  supporting  and supported  (to  include  Average  Daily  Student  Load)  populations  (i.e.,  funded  authorizations  or man-years).  It is not intended for use in allocating or programming manpower by functional area as  these  should  be  determined  by  application  of  Air  Force  Manpower  Standards  or  other manpower  determinants.    The  percentages  outlined  in  this  attachment  remain  effective  until either  this  publication  is  updated  or  AF/A1MP  issues  a  policy  letter  with  updated  transfer percentages. A7.2.  BST  Factor  use.  The  use  of  a  BST  factor  assumes  the  presence  of  a  full  base  support infrastructure prior to making the proposed mission change.  There are two factors: the Weapon System BST is 7.6% and the General BST is 6.2% A7.2.1.  Weapon  System  BST:    Developed  to  include  General  BST,  this  factor  estimates common  IS  requirements  as  well  as  those  that  indirectly  support  aircraft  or  other  weapon system  operations,  e.g.,  vehicle  maintenance  and  fuels  management.    This  factor  should  be used to determine BST associated with mission/operational unit moves. A7.2.2.  General  BST:    Used  to  estimate  common  IS  for  activities  moving  into/from  an installation; examples include FOAs, NAFs or HQ units. A7.3.  Mission  Transfers.  For  mission  transfers  between  Active,  Air  National  Guard  or  Air Force Reserve, or new Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve missions on an active duty base, AF/A1MP will compute IS impacts as follows: A7.3.1.  For Active Guard and Reserves (AGRs), AF/A1MP will compute IS impacts using the same approved CONUS general support factor (6.2%) used for active full time military. A7.3.2.  For  drill  spaces,  AF/A1MP  will  compute  IS  by  applying  a  2%  factor  to  total  drill spaces. A7.4.  IS  reductions.  Any  resulting  IS  manpower  reductions  associated  with  these  mission transfers will be retained by AF/A1MP as program savings for use in future programming cycles. Any  resulting  increases  in  IS  manpower  associated  with  these  mission  transfers  must  be programmed as part of the mission transfer and offset by the activity proposing the transfer. A7.4.1.  MAJCOMs must coordinate all self-initiated programming factors with the affected commands  (including  host  tenant  support  agreements  and  inter-command  transfers)  that impose  IS  workload  on  other  commands.    AF/A1MP  does  not  provide  offsets  for  IS resources in such cases. A7.4.2.  For actions impacting the Air Reserve Components, the tasking command, including the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve, must develop manpower agreements and work with the affected commands on transfers of base support resources to support unit moves. A7.4.3.  The  tasking  command  provides,  or  programs  for,  required  base  support  resources when a prime function or tenant organization of that command is moved. AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015   47  A7.4.3.1.  Refer any disagreement between losing and gaining commands to AF/A1MP. A7.4.4.  AF/A1MP  normally  does  not  program  an  IS  manpower  tail  to  support  changes  to other IS functions or non-mission areas. A7.4.5.  AF/SG  determines  medical  support  requirements  in  a  separate  medical  annual planning and programming guidance exercise.  Their requirements are typically made known during the PBR and codified in MOAs. A7.4.6.  AF/A4/7 determines real property requirements during the POM process.  AF/A4/7 utilizes total square footage of floor space, not population, as the primary driver to determine their  manpower  requirements.    Mission  changes  and  resulting  population  changes  do  not necessarily drive changes in real property requirements. A7.4.7.  The  Defense  Commissary  Agency  determines  commissary  support  requirements generated by a change in mission manpower requirements.  Their requirements are identified through the corporate process. A7.4.8.  USAF organizations tasked by other government departments or DoD agencies must develop  manpower  and  funding  agreements  via  the  inter-service  support  agreement  (ISSA) and  work  with  AF/A8  and  respective  functional  staff  to  ensure  that  required  out-year manpower programming actions are addressed.    48  AFI38-204  21 APRIL 2015 Attachment 8 OVER/UNDER EXECUTION REQUEST EXAMPLE 17 January 2016 MEMORANDUM FOR AF/A1MP  FROM:  HQ MAJCOM/A1M                123 Main Street                XXX AFB, ZZ 99999  SUBECT: (U) Request to Over-Execute the Unit Manpower Document (UMD)  1.

In the event one or more MAJCOM HQs cannot reach a mutual agreement on the  amount  of  MHQ  to  be  transferred/added/eliminated  as  a  result  of  a  mission  change, AF/A1MP will provide arbitration. A9.2.  A new MHQ transfer factor is being developed and was not available at the time this AFI was published.  Once a new transfer factor is approved, AF/A1MP will publish a policy letter to be used until this publication is updated.
