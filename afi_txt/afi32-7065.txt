This  Instruction  outlines  required  actions  and  processes  for  managing  and  protecting  cultural resources  on  property  affected  by  operations  on  installations  of  the  United  States  Air  Force (USAF)  which  includes  Active  Air  Force,  Air  Force  Reserve  Command  (AFRC),  Air  National Guard  (ANG),  and  government-owned,  contractor-operated  facilities  on  Air  Force  controlled lands.    For  installations  outside  the  United  States  and  its  territories,  compliance  requirements within  the  Overseas  Environmental  Baseline  Guidance  Document  and  the  Final  Governing Standards  for  the  host  country  take  precedence  over  this  document  (refer  to  AFI  32-7006, Environmental  Program  in  Foreign  Countries).    This  Instruction  may  be  supplemented  at  any level,  but  all  supplements  that  directly  implement  this  publication  must  be  routed  to Headquarters,  United  States  Air  Force,  Deputy  Chief  of  Staff  for  Logistics,  Installations  & Mission Support - Directorate of Civil Engineers - Facilities, Environment and Energy Division (HQ  USAF/A4CF)  for  coordination  prior  to  certification  and  approval.      Further,  the  ANG  or AFRC  will  support  the  intent  of  this  Air  Force  Instruction,  and  where  needed  may  prepare  an appropriate policy, supplement, guidance, and/or procedural document reflecting its unique legal status, resources, and structure, as recognized by the reserve component authorities of Title 10 of the  United  States  Code,  Air  Force  Doctrine  and  other  governing  authorities.      Refer recommended  changes  and  questions  about  this  publication  to  the  Office  of  Primary Responsibility  (OPR)  using  the  AF  Form  847,  Recommendation  for  Change  of  Publication; route AF Forms 847s from the field through the appropriate functional chain of command. The authorities to waive wing/unit level requirements in this publication are identified with a tier (“T-2 AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 0,  T-1,  T-2,  T-3”)  number  following  the  compliance  statement.    See  AFI  33-360,  Publications and  Forms  Management,  for  a  description  of  the  authorities  associated  with  the  tier  numbers.  Submit  requests  for  waivers  through  the  chain  of  command  to  the  appropriate  tier  waiver approval  authority,  or  alternately,  to  the  publication  OPR  for  non-tiered  compliance  items.  Ensure  that  all  records  created  as  a  result  of  processes  prescribed  in  this  publication  are maintained  in  accordance  with  Air  Force  Manual  (AFMAN)  33-363,  Management  of  Records, and disposed of in accordance with the Air Force Records Disposition Schedule (RDS) located in the  Air  Force  Records  Information  Management  System  (AFRIMS).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES These  interim  changes  revise  AFI  32-7065  by  (1)  reflecting  changes  identified  and  agreed  to during the compliance statement review by SAF/AA, (2) correcting publishing formatting issues, and  (3)  updating  statutory  citations  of  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act  from  Title  16  to Title 54.  In December 19, 2014, Public Law 13-287 amended the National Historic Preservation Act  (NHPA),  Public  Law  89-665,  by  re-codifying  it  from  Title  16  of  the  United  States  Code (U.S.C.)  to  its  new  location  in  Title  54.  This  recodification  did  not  affect  the  numbering  of sections within the Act  (for example,  consultation  requirements are still in "Section 106"),  and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP) regulations  that implement  the Act  are still at 36 C.F.R. Part 800.  The recodification did affect the way in which the NHPA is cited in the  U.S.C.;  Section  106  is  now  codified  as  Title  54  U.S.C.  §  306108,  while  Section  110  is codified  at  54  U.S.C.  §§  306101-107,  109-114.

Cultural resources funding requirements must be entered into this sub-module of ACES-PM to be considered for funding. Area of Potential Effect (APE)—The land area an undertaking has the potential to effect.    The APE includes the footprint of the proposed project, and areas around the footprint that might be affected  by  visual,  auditory,  erosional,  and  other  direct  and  indirect  results  of  the  undertaking.  Region of Influence (or Interest) (ROI) for NEPA documents may or may not align with NHPA Section 106  APE, which, in any case, always should be defined independently of ROI in NEPA documents. Alaska  Native  Entities—Alaska  Native  villages,  tribes,  communities,  associations,  and corporations  are  equivalent  to  federally  recognized  Tribes  for  the  purposes  of  consultations pursuant to NAGPRA and NHPA Section 106.  Native Alaska villages and corporations include those groups or communities defined in, or established by, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Air  Force  Federal  Preservation  Officer  (AF  FPO)—An  official  appointed  by  the  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Installations, Environment and Energy) in accordance with 54 U.S.C. § 30101 to direct the AF Cultural Resources Program and MD 1-18, A1.32.3.2. Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation  (Council)—The  independent  federal  agency created  by  the  NHPA  Section  106,  as  amended,  to  advise  the  President,  Congress,  and  Federal agencies  on  all  matters  related  to  historic  preservation.    The  Council  also  administers  NHPA Section 106 through 36 C.F.R. Part 800, Protection of Historic Properties. Automated  Civil  Engineering  System-Real  Property  database  (and  Asset  Management database)  [ACES-RP  (and  AM)]—The  sub-module  that  contains  all  Air  Force  real  property AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 27 records  and  historic  codes.    In  this  context,  real  property  generally  is  any  building,  facility, structure, or object  with  an installation number.  Data on archaeological  sites, sacred sites, and TCP  currently  are  not  maintained  in  ACES-RP,  although  DoD  plans  to  require  these  kinds  of data in departmental real property databases in the future. Adverse Effect—Reduction in the characteristics that make an historic property eligible for the National  Register  of  Historic  Places.    The  integrity  of  the  location,  design,  setting,  materials, workmanship, association, or other qualities that are important to defining the National Register eligibility of the historic property is diminished.   Advisory  Council  on  Historic  Preservation  (Council)—The  independent  federal  agency created by the NHPA, as amended, to advise the President, Congress, and Federal agencies on all matters related to historic preservation.  The Council also administers Section 106 of the NHPA through 36 C.F.R. § 800, Protection of Historic Properties. Air  Force  Federal  Preservation  Officer  (AF  FPO)—An  official  appointed  by  the  Assistant Secretary of the Air Force  (Installations, Environment and Energy) in accordance with Section 110 of the NHPA to direct the AF Cultural Resources Program and MD 1-18, A1.32.3.2.

Native Alaska villages and corporations include those groups or communities defined in, or established by, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Alternative  or  Creative  Mitigation—Alternatives  to  archaeological  data  recovery  or  historic building recordation as mitigation for an undertaking’s adverse effects. These approaches can be implemented as the only treatment option, or may be part of a package where different historic properties are subject to different kinds and levels of mitigation. Archaeological  Resources—Any  material  remains  of  past  human  life  or  activities  that  are  of capable of providing scientific or humanistic understandings of past human behavior and cultural adaptation  through  the  application  of  scientific  or  scholarly  techniques.  (See  ARPA  and  32 C.F.R. § 229.3). Area of Potential Effect (APE)—The land area an undertaking has the potential to effect.    The APE includes the footprint of the proposed project, and areas around the footprint that might be affected  by  visual,  auditory,  erosional,  and  other  direct  and  indirect  results  of  the  undertaking.  Region of Influence (or Interest) (ROI) for NEPA documents may or may not align with NHPA Section 106 APE, which, in any case, always should be defined independently of ROI in NEPA documents. Business  Data—Geographic  Information  System  (GIS)  specialists  think  of  Business  Data  as metadata,  i.e.,  information  associated  with  geographic  spatial  data.    Business  data  often describes, evaluates, interprets, associates, references, or clarifies spatial data.  Business data also includes site files, curation data, laboratory analyses, records, photographs, and file information crucial to day-to-day operations in cultural resources management. Comprehensive  Agreement—For  NAGPRA,  an  agreement  between  a  federal  agency  and  an Indian Tribe concerning all agency land management activities that could result in the intentional excavation or inadvertent discovery of Native American human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects,  or  objects  of  cultural  patrimony.    The  Comprehensive  Agreement  should  establish 28 AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 procedures  for  consultation,  treatment,  and  disposition  of  NAGPRA  remains  or  cultural  objects likely  to  be  found  during  any  undertaking  or  action  on  agency  lands  [per  43  C.F.R.  §10.5(f)].  The signed agreement, or correspondence related to efforts to reach agreement, constitute proof of  consultation.    A  Contingency  Plan  of  Action  (not  used  in  NAGPRA  or  43  C—F.R.  §  10)  is similar to a Comprehensive Agreement, but deals only with NAGPRA remains and objects likely to  be  discovered  during  a  specific  undertaking  or  action.    Tribal  officials  AND  the  installation commander  (or  his/her  delegated  sub-commander)  must  sign  Comprehensive  Agreements,  but only the installation commander or delegate signs Plans of Action [per 43 C.F.R. § 10.5(e)]. Consulting  Parties—IAW  36  C.F.R.  Part  800.2(c),  parties  with  consulting  roles  in  the  NHPA Section 106 Process include SHPO and/or THPO.  Consulting parties might also include Indian Tribal  governments;  representatives  of  local  governments;  applicants  for  federal  assistance, permits,  licenses,  and  other  approvals;  and  members  of  the  Public  with  interests  in  the undertaking. Cooperative  Agreement—Agreements  between  Air  Force  and  other  federal  agencies  or between Air Force and States, local governments, tribal governments or other entities to provide the Air Force with goods and services, when such agreements are in the best interests of the Air Force, and when the process is more economical than procurement under contract.  Authorized under 31 U.S.C. § 1535, The Economy Act, and 10 U.S.C. § 2684, Cooperative Agreements for Management of Cultural Resources. Cooperative  Agreement—Agreements  between  Air  Force  and  other  federal  agencies  or between Air Force and States, local governments, tribal governments or other entities to provide the Air Force with goods and services, when such agreements are in the best interests of the Air Force, and when the process is more economical than procurement under contract.  Authorized under 31 U.S.C. §Part 1535, The Economy Act, and 10 U.S.C. § 2684, Cooperative Agreements for Management of Cultural Resources. Consensus  versus  Formal  Determination  of  Eligibility—A  “Formal  Determination  of Eligibility  for  Listing  on  the  National  Register”  is  made  by  the  Keeper.    A  “consensus determination” is a written agreement between an installation and SHPO/THPO that a property is eligible for listing.  Nomination to  the Register is  not  necessary  with  either determination. The consensus  process  is  not  a  lower  threshold  for  significance  than  a  formal  determination  of eligibility by the Keeper, or the National Register listing procedures. A consensus determination is  a  legally  recognized  finding  that  a  property  meets  the  criteria  for  listing  in  the  National Register.  Under  Section  106,  properties  that  are  eligible  are  given  the  same  legal  status  as properties formally listed in the National Register. Consultation—A  reasonable  and  good  faith  effort  to  involve  affected  and  interested  parties  in the  findings,  determinations,  and  decisions  made  during  the  Section  106  Process,  and  other processes  required  under  NAGPRA,  AIRFA,  NEPA,  ARPA,  and  other  statutes  and  regulations.  Consultations  with  Tribes  must  be  on  a  government-to-government  level  to  respect  tribal sovereignty and to recognize the unique legal relationship between the Federal Government and Tribes set forth in the Constitution, treaties, statutes, and court decisions (see also Notification). Consulting  Parties—IAW  36  C.F.R.  §  800.2(c),  parties  with  consulting  roles  in  the  NHPA Section 106 Process include SHPO and/or THPO.  Consulting parties might also include Indian Tribal  governments;  representatives  of  local  governments;  applicants  for  federal  assistance, AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 29 permits,  licenses,  and  other  approvals;  and  members  of  the  Public  with  interests  in  the undertaking. Criteria of Adverse Effect—Standards/guidelines used to determine whether the effects caused by  an  activity,  project  or  program  (i.e.,  an  undertaking  that  has  the  potential  to  affect  cultural resources) will be detrimental to historic properties, in accordance with the Council's regulations (36 C.F.R. § 800.5). An adverse effect  occurs when a project  or program  alters or destroys the characteristics of a property that qualify it for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.  This may include diminishing the integrity of the property's location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, internal composition or association with past events or people. An adverse effect may  include  but  is  not  limited  to:  1)  destruction  or  alteration  of  all  or  part  of  a  property;  2) isolation  from  or  alteration  of  the  surrounding  environment  of  the  property;  3)  introduction  of visual,  audible,  or  atmospheric  elements  that  are  out  of  character  with  the  property  or  alter  its setting; 4) neglect of a property resulting in its deterioration or destruction; 5) transfer or sale of federally owned, leased or controlled property without adequate consultation on restrictions for the preservation and maintenance of the historic property.  Cultural  Resource—Historic  properties  (any  prehistoric  or  historic  district,  site,  building, structure, or object as defined by 36 C.F.R. Part800 included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National  Register  of  Historic  Places,  whether  or  not  such  eligibility  has  been  formally determined),  including  artifacts,  records,  and  material  remains  related  to  such  a  property  or resource;  cultural  items  as  defined  in  NAGPRA;  American  Indian,  Eskimo,  Aleut,  or  Native Hawaiian  sacred  sites  as  defined  in  E.O.  13007;  archaeological  resources  as  defined  in  NHPA Section  106;  and,  archaeological  artifact  collections  and  associated  records  as  defined  in  36 C.F.R. Part79. Cultural  Resource—Historic  properties  (any  prehistoric  or  historic  district,  site,  building, structure, or object as defined by 36 C.F.R. §t  800 included in,  or eligible for inclusion in,  the National  Register  of  Historic  Places,  whether  or  not  such  eligibility  has  been  formally determined),  including  artifacts,  records,  and  material  remains  related  to  such  a  property  or resource;  cultural  items  as  defined  in  NAGPRA;  American  Indian,  Eskimo,  Aleut,  or  Native Hawaiian  sacred  sites  as  defined  in  E.O.  13007;  archaeological  resources  as  defined  in  NHPA; and, archaeological artifact collections and associated records as defined in 36 C.F.R. §79.

Curation—The process of managing and preserving an archaeological collection of artifacts and records according to professional museum and archival practices, as defined in 36 C.F.R. § 79.  Refer  to  Legacy  Resource  Management  Program  Office,  Legacy  Project  No.  98-1714, Guidelines  for  the  Field  Collection  of  Archaeological  Materials  and  Standard  Operating Procedures  for  Curating  Department  of  Defense  Archaeological  Collections,  available  through the DENIX and AF Cultural Resources CoP and or eDASH CRM websites. District—“A district is a geographically definable area, urban or rural, possessing a significant concentration,  linkage,  or  continuity  of  sites,  buildings,  structures,  or  objects  united  by  past 30 AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 events or aesthetically by plan or physical development.  A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history” (36 C.F.R. § 60.3). Economic  Analysis—A  comprehensive  report  that  details  the  feasibility  of  preserving  or rehabilitating  a  historic  structure.  The  study  must  include  the  costs  to  prepare  all  necessary NEPA  documentation,  complete  hazardous  waste  disposal,  undertake  any  environmental remediation measures, complete a HABS Level I recordation of the property, prepare the site for new construction, and the cost to dispose of all demolition debris. The report must also detail the cost to undertake an in-kind replacement of the historic building.  Economic Analyses also must cover  all  of  the  hidden  costs  of  building  demolition  (hazardous  waste  disposal,  recordation, recycling materials, etc.). Effect—Any alteration to those characteristics of a historic or cultural property that qualify it for inclusion  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (e.g.  disturbing  an  archaeological  site feature,  such  as  a  house  ring  or  foundation).    An  effect,  whether  positive  or  negative,  requires Section 106 review and consultation. See also Criteria of Adverse Effect.  Emergency or Disaster Situations—In effect when the President, a governor, or a tribal leader declares that an immediate threat to life or property exists. Evaluation—Application of the National Register of Historic Places eligibility criteria, 36 CFR §Part  60.4  and  36  C.F.R.  §  63  to  cultural  resources.    A  professionally  trained  and  qualified cultural  resources  specialist  (e.g.,  historic  architect;  architectural  historian;  archaeologist)  must complete  this  task  for  the  installation  following  coordination  with  the  applicable  Air  Force offices identified in Table 2-1. prior to initial consultation with the SHPO or the THPO. Geospatial  Data—The  concept  for  collection,  information  extraction,  storage,  dissemination, and  exploitation  of  geodetic,  geomagnetic,  imagery,  gravimetric,  aeronautical,  topographic, hydrographic, littoral, and cultural, data accurately referenced to a precise location on the earth's surface. These data are used for military planning, training, and operations including navigation, mission  planning,  mission  rehearsal,  modeling,  simulation  and  precise  targeting.  Geospatial information  provides  the  basic  framework  for  visualizing  the  Earth’s  surface.    Geospatial  data are information produced by multiple sources to common interoperable data standards, presented in  the  form  of  printed  maps,  charts,  and  publications;  in  digital  simulation  and  modeling databases; in photographic form; or in the form of digitized maps and charts. Geospatial data are housed in GISs. Heritage Asset—See Historic Property. Historic Facilities—See Historic Property. Historic  Preservation—54  U.S.C.  §  300315,  states  that  the  term  ‘‘preservation’’  or  ‘‘historic preservation’’  includes—(1)  identification,  evaluation,  recordation,  documentation,  curation, acquisition,  protection,  management,  rehabilitation,  restoration,  stabilization,  maintenance, research,  interpretation,  and  conservation;  (2)  education  and  training  regarding  the  foregoing activities; or (3) any combination of the foregoing activities. Historic  Preservation—Section 301(8) of the  NHPA, 16 U.S.C. § 470w(8), states that historic preservation  "includes recordation,  documentation,  curation, acquisition,  protection,  management,  rehabilitation,  restoration,  stabilization,  maintenance, research,  interpretation,  conservation,  and  education  and  training"  regarding  cultural  resources.  identification,  evaluation, AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 31 The  Secretary  of  the  Interior's  Standards  for  the  Treatment  of  Historic  Properties  (NPS  1997) defines historic preservation as "the act or process of applying measures necessary to sustain the existing form, integrity, and materials of a historic property." Historic  Preservation  Review  Process—The  series  of  actions  (including  consultation, background  studies,  surveys,  resource  identifications,  assessments  and  treatments)  that implement the section of the National Historic Preservation Act that requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of their undertakings on any cultural resources or historic properties that meet  the National  Register of Historic Places criteria.  Part of this process  involves taking action to avoid or minimize harm to eligible resources (historic properties). Historic  Property  (or  Historic  Resource—Per  NHPA  Section  106,  the  term  ‘‘historic property’’ means any prehistoric or historic district,  site, building, structure, or object  included on, or eligible  for inclusion  on, the National  Register, including artifacts, records,  and material remains  relating  to  the  district,  site,  building,  structure,  or  object.    This  definition  of  Historic Property is equivalent  to “Heritage Asset” as used by the  Federal  Accounting Standards Board and the Federal Real Property Council. Historic Property (or  Historic Resource)—“Any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure,  or  object  included  in  or  eligible  for  inclusion  on  the  National  Register,  including artifacts,  records, and material remains related to such a property or  resource.” (NHPA Section 301(5)).    Title  36  C.F.R.  §  60.4  explains  criteria  for  determining  eligibility  for  listing  to  the National Register.  This definition of Historic Property is equivalent to “Heritage Asset.” Historic Status Code—The official National Register of Historic Places status listed in the Real Property  Inventory  (RPI:  ACES-RP/AM  and  future  replacements)  for  each  asset.    The  status codes  are  published  and  defined  by  DoD.    The  appropriate  entries  are  determined  by  the installation  or  AFCEC/ANG/AFRC  CRM  and  reflect  SHPO  concurrence,  or  eligibility determinations  by  the  Keeper.    Each  facility  coded  as  an  Historic  Property  (Heritage  Asset)  in the  RPI  (e.g.,  ELPA;  NHLC;  NHLI;  NREC;  NREI;  NRLC;  NRLI)    must  be  supported  by appropriate documentation.    Facilities coded as DNE must have documentation supporting the not-eligible determination. https://app.eis.af.mil/a7cportal/CEPlaybooks/Pages/default.aspx Identification  of  Historic  Properties—A  process  using  specific  methods  and  techniques  to locate  and  define  the  characteristics,  nature,  extent,  and  boundaries  of  cultural  resources  and historic  properties. the  Secretary  of  Interior’s  Standards  and  Guidelines  for Identification). Identification  is  one  of  the  first  steps  in  the  NHPA  Section  106  process,  which includes preliminary work, actual efforts  to identify properties, and the  evaluation  of identified properties to determine if they qualify as historic properties.  The standard is a "reasonable and good faith effort" for identification and evaluation.   (See Indian  Lands  or  Tribal  Lands—Defined  in  ARPA  as:  “…lands  of  Indian  tribes,  or  Indian individuals, which are either held in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States, except for subsurface interests not owned or controlled by  an  Indian  tribe  or  Indian  individual.”      Indian  Lands  include  tribal  reservations,  trust  lands, and “Usual and Accustomed Places” for subsistence collecting, hunting, and fishing.  The latter are often called “Treaty Lands.” Indian  Tribe—For  the  purposes  of  this  Instruction,  the  term  Indian  Tribe  (Tribe)  includes federally recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Entities.  A federally recognized 32 AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 tribe is one the United States government formally recognizes as a sovereign entity that requires government-to-government relations. The federal government holds lands in trust for many, but not  all,  Tribes.    Some  tribes  are  not  federally  recognized,  and  are  not  afforded  special  rights under federal law.  Cultural resources management programs on installations are required under various statutes to  specially interact  and consult  with  federally  recognized Tribes (but not  with tribes  that  are  not  federally  recognized).    The  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  (BIA)  maintains  the official  list  of federally  recognized Tribes.   At present,  this list  contains 567  Indian Tribes  and Alaska  Native  Entities  (Volume  77  Federal  Register  Parts  47868  -47873,  Bureau  of  Indian Affairs, Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  August 2012  <http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc-020700.pdf>). 10, Indian  Tribe—For  the  purposes  of  this  Instruction,  the  term  Indian  Tribe  (Tribe)  includes federally recognized American Indian Tribes and Alaska Native Entities.  A federally recognized tribe is one the United States government formally recognizes as a sovereign entity that requires government-to-government relations.

At present,  this list  contains 566  Indian Tribes  and Alaska  Native  Entities  (Volume  77  Federal  Register  Parts  47868  -47873,  Bureau  of  Indian Affairs, Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible To Receive Services From the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  August 2012  <http://www.bia.gov/cs/groups/public/documents/text/idc-020700.pdf>). 10, Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP)—A document that lists/describes installation cultural resources, defines procedures and policies, and outlines plans for managing cultural  resources  on  DoD  installations.    ICRMP  are  required  for  all  DoD  installations  under Section  6(e)  and  Enclosure  6  of  DoDI  4715.16.    ICRMP  are  comprehensive,  and  implement DODI  4715.9,  Environmental  Planning  and  Analysis,  ensuring  that  installations  fully  integrate cultural resources planning with other land management and development plans at installations.  Air  Force  installations  must  update  or  review  their  plan  at  least  annually  and  complete  major revisions  as  mission  changes  warrant.    Planned  activities  in  approved  ICRMP  are  legal  drivers for  annual  program  planning  and  funding.  ICRMP  must  be  approved  no  less  than  every  five years by current base or wing commanders, or as delegated by said commanders to the BCE or equivalent leadership, and when changes/updates warrant re-approval. Integrated Cultural Resources Management Plan (ICRMP)—A document that lists/describes installation cultural resources, defines procedures and policies, and outlines plans for managing cultural  resources  on  DoD  installations.    ICRMP  are  required  for  all  DoD  installations  under Section  6(e)  and  Enclosure  6  of  DoDI  4715.16.    ICRMP  are  comprehensive,  and  implement DODI  4715.9,  Environmental  Planning  and  Analysis,  ensuring  that  installations  fully  integrate cultural resources planning with other land management and development plans at installations.  Air  Force  installations  must  update  or  review  their  plan  at  least  annually  on  E-PLAN,  and complete major revisions as mission changes warrant.  Planned activities in approved ICRMP are legal drivers for annual program planning and funding. ICRMP must be signed by current base or wing commanders, and when changes/updates warrant re-approval. AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 33 Interested  Person  or  Party—In  the  NHPA  Section  106  process,  an  individual,  group  or organization  concerned  with  the  effects  of  an  undertaking  on  historic  properties.    These  may request an opportunity to participate as consulting parties.  Material  Remains—Physical  evidence  of  human  occupation  or  use.  These  are  artifacts, ecofacts, and features, from or at the location, or in the context, in which the events occurred. Mitigation—Actions or treatments that lessen, eliminate, or compensate for the adverse effects of  undertakings  to  historic  properties.    These  actions  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  1) moving the undertaking to avoid effects; 2) reducing the extent of the effects by redesigning the undertaking; 3) compensating for the effects by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the affected historic  properties;  4)  preservation  and  protection  actions  during  actual  implementation  of  the undertaking; and/or 5) compensating for the effect by documenting the historic property, moving the  historic  property  to  a  protected  area,  or  conducting  data  recovery.    This  Instruction encourages  “Creative”  or  “Alternative”  mitigation,  which  can  include  preserving,  protecting, studying,  or  restoring  non-affected  properties  substituted  for  the  affected  property.    Creative mitigation  may  involve  publishing  detailed  research,  or  publically-oriented  documents  on  the archaeology or history of a region or locale, or creating a scale model or other representation of the  affected  property  for  a  park  or  museum.    (See  the  Secretary  of  Interior's  Standards  and Guidelines  Note  on  Documentation  and  Treatment  of  Historic  Properties,  Historical Documentation,  Architectural and  Archeological Documentation).  and  Engineering  Documentation Program Alternatives—36 C.F.R. Part 800.14 outlines a variety of methods available to federal agencies to meet their historic preservation review obligations.  Each of these alternatives allows federal  agencies  to  tailor  the  NHPA  Section  106  process  to  meet  their  needs.    Alternate procedures  include  Alternate  Procedures;  Programmatic  Agreements;  Prototype  Programmatic Agreements; Exempted Categories; Standard Treatments; and Program Comments. Sacred Site—Defined in E.O. 13007as, “Any specific, discrete, narrowly delineated location on federal  land  that  is  identified  by  an  Indian  Tribe,  or  Indian  individual  determined  to  be  an appropriately  authoritative  representative  of  an  Indian  religion,  as  sacred  by  virtue  of  its established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion; provided that the Tribe or appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion has informed the agency of the existence of such a site” (see DoDI 4710.02). Section  106,  NHPA—Effect  of  undertaking  on  historic  property—The head of any  Federal agency  having  direct  or  indirect  jurisdiction  over  a  proposed  Federal  or  federally  assisted undertaking in any State and the head of any Federal department or independent agency having authority  to  license  any  undertaking,  prior  to  the  approval  of  the  expenditure  of  any  Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, shall take into account the effect of  the  undertaking  on  any  historic  property.  The  head  of  the  Federal  agency  shall  afford  the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to the undertaking. Section  110  Guidelines—Guidance  for  establishing,  monitoring,  reviewing,  and  evaluating Federal  historic  preservation  programs.    Each  program  should  incorporate  provisions  of  other relevant  statutes,  such  as  AIRFA  and  NEPA.    Originally  published  as  The  Secretary  of  the Interior's  Standards  and  Guidelines  for  Federal  Agency  Historic  Preservation  Programs Pursuant  to  Section  110  of  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act,  the  guidelines  define  the required components of a sound federal historic preservation program. 34 AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 Section  110  Inventories  and  Evaluations—Archaeological  or  historic  building  surveys  and National  Register  evaluations  completed  IAW  requirements  to  identify  historic  properties  on agency  land  to  facilitate  good  planning  and  streamline  later  36  C.F.R.  Part  800  consultations.  Surveys  and  eligibility  determinations  for  Section  306102  must  be  coordinated  with SHPO/THPO  and  other  appropriate  parties  for  concurrence  to  ensure  future  applicability  to  36 C.F.R.  Part  800  undertakings  that  occur  in  surveyed  areas.    A  key  component  to  successful surveys is recordkeeping. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)—The official appointed by the Governor of each State  and  territory  to  carry  out  the  functions  defined  in  Title  54  U.S.C.  §  302301  and  to administer  the  State  Historic  Preservation  Program.    SHPOs  provide  advice  and  assistance  to federal  agencies  regarding  their  Cultural  Resources  Management  programs  and  historic preservation  responsibilities.    The  NHPA  has  been  amended  over  the  years,  with  attendant changes to 36 C.F.R. Part 800, resulting in THPO most often being consulted concurrently with SHPO. The  Native  American  Graves  Protection  and  Repatriation  Act  (NAGPRA)—A federal  law passed in 1990. NAGPRA provides a process for museums and federal agencies to return certain Native American cultural items -- human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural  patrimony  --  to  lineal  descendants,  and  culturally  affiliated  Indian  Tribes  and  NHOs. NAGPRA  includes  provisions  for  unclaimed  and  culturally  unidentifiable  Native  American cultural  items,  intentional  and  inadvertent  discovery  of  Native  American  cultural  items  on federal  and  tribal  lands,  and  penalties  for  noncompliance  and  illegal  trafficking.  In  addition, NAGPRA  authorizes  federal  grants  to  Indian  Tribes,  NHOs,  and  museums  to  assist  with  the documentation  and  repatriation  of  Native  American  cultural  items,  and  establishes  the  Native American  Graves  Protection  and  Repatriation  Review  Committee  to  monitor  the  NAGPRA process  and  facilitate  the  resolution  of  disputes  that  may  arise  concerning  repatriation  under NAGPRA. Native  American—A person with origins in any of the original peoples of North America and who maintains cultural  identification through tribal  affiliation  or has community  recognition  as an American Indian or Alaskan Native. Native  Hawaiian  Organization  (NHO)—Defined  IAW  NAGPRA  Section  2(10)  “A  Native Hawaiian organization includes any  organization that:  (a) serves  and represents  the interests of Native  Hawaiians,  (b)  has  as  a  primary  and  stated  purpose  the  provision  of  services  to  Native Hawaiians,  and  (c)  has  expertise  in  Native  Hawaiian  Affairs,  and  includes  the  Office  of Hawaiian  Affairs  and  Hui  Malama  I  Na  Kupuna  `O  Hawai`i  Nei.”  The  Department  of  the Interior  has  interpreted  this  definition  to  also  include  the  Hawaiian  island  burial  councils  and various 'Ohanas (extended families).  (See Consultation with Native Hawaiian Organizations in the Section 106 Process: A Handbook; and DoDI 4710.03). National Historic Landmark—Historic property that meets the criteria of the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated by the Secretary of the Interior for its special national importance  in  the  history  of  the  United  States.  Air  Force  examples  include  Randolph  Field Historic District at Randolph AFB and the Cadet Area of the Air Force Academy.  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP)—The  Federal  government's  official  list  of buildings,  structures,  districts,  sites,  and  objects  that  are  significant  in  American  history, architecture,  archaeology,  engineering,  or  culture,  and  are  thereby  considered  for  preservation.  AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 35 The National Register is administered by the Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS).    Criteria  for  eligibility,  and  the  procedures  for  nomination,  making  changes  to  listed properties, and for removing properties from the National Register are detailed in 36 C.F.R. § 60, "National Register of Historic Places." Notification—Written notification (vs. Consultation) is specifically required in various statutes.  For  example,  affiliated  federally  recognized  Tribes  must  be  notified  30  days  before  a  federal agency  may  issue  an  ARPA  permit  if  the  proposed  research  might  disturb  or  harm  any  Indian tribal  or  religious  site  on  agency  land  [32  C.F.R.  §  229.7(a)].    Written  notification  also  is required  by  NAGPRA  for  planned  intentional  excavation  or  inadvertent  discovery  of  Native American human remains, and funerary or sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony.   See 43  C.F.R.  §  10.5(b)  for  the  list  of  people  who  must  be  notified  under  NAGPRA.    The  NHPA requires notification of the Council that an undertaking will adversely affect a historic property [36 C.F.R. § 800.6(a)(1)]. Plan  of  Action—A  written  plan,  prepared,  approved,  and  signed  by  a  federal  agency  official (e.g.,  the  installation  commander),  in  response  to  an  inadvertent  discovery  or  intentional excavation  of  Native  American  human  remains,  funerary  objects,  sacred  objects,  or  objects  of cultural  patrimony  on  agency  land.    A  Contingency  Plan  of  Action  is  similar  but  is  developed prior  to  a  specific  planned  undertaking  or  action  likely  to  result  in  the  discovery  of  NAGPRA remains or objects.  Both kinds of Plans of Action are completed after consultation between the federal agency and a federally recognized Tribe affiliated with the NAGPRA remains or cultural objects.   The Plan of Action outlines consultation procedures, treatment, and disposition of the NAGPRA  remains  and  objects.    Signatures  of  Tribal  officials  are  not  required  (43  C.F.R.  § 10.5(e)). Program  Comment  and  Nationwide  Programmatic  Agreement—Programmatic  alternatives to NHPA Section 106 review developed through negotiations between a federal agency and the Advisory  Council  to  streamline  Section  106  review  for  a  category  of  possibly  significant resources, IAW 36 C.F.R. § 800.14(a)].  Currently in effect: 1. ACHP, Programmatic Agreement with  DoD,  Demolition  of  World  War  II  Temporary  Buildings,  July  7,  1986,  amended  May  1 1991;  2.  ACHP,  Program  Comment,  Wherry  and  Capehart  Era  Family  Housing  at  Air  Force and Navy Bases, November 18, 2004; 3. ACHP, Program Comment, Ammunition and Explosives Storage  for  the  Navy  (1939-1989)  and  the  Air  Force  (1946-1989),  May  2011;  4.  ACHP, Program  Comment,  Air  Force  and  Navy  Unaccompanied  Personnel  Housing  During  the  Cold War Era (1946-1989), May 2011. Proponent—The  commander,  commanding  officer,  or  civilian  director  of  a  unit,  activity,  or organization,  who  initiates  a  proposal  for  an  undertaking,  who  has  command  and  control authority over the undertaking once it is authorized, or who has the legal and financial authority to commit the Air Force to agreements undertaken in compliance with cultural resource laws and regulations. Sacred site—Defined in E.O. 13007as, “Any specific, discrete, narrowly delineated location on federal  land  that  is  identified  by  an  Indian  Tribe,  or  Indian  individual  determined  to  be  an appropriately  authoritative  representative  of  an  Indian  religion,  as  sacred  by  virtue  of  its established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion; provided that the Tribe or appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian religion has informed the agency of the existence of such a site” (see DoDI 4710.02 and DoDI 4710.03). 36 AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for Federal Agency Historic Preservation Programs  Pursuant  to  Section  110  of  the  NHPA—Published  in  Federal  Register  (24  April 1998)  and  in  Archeology  and  Historic  Preservation:  Secretary  of  the  Interior's  Standards  and Guidelines  (48  FR44716).    The  Standards  and  Guidelines  are  a  series  of  guidance  documents created  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  under  authority  of  the  NHPA.    The  Standards  and Guidelines  do  not  set  agency  policy  but  assist  in  organizing  information  about  historic preservation activities; in describing steps achieved by federal agencies, states, and others when planning for the identification, evaluation, registration, and treatment of historic properties, and in integrating the diverse efforts of the various entities to preserve the Nation's cultural heritage. Section 106 Program Alternatives—36 C.F.R. § 800.14 outlines a variety of methods available to  federal  agencies  to  meet  their  Section  106  obligations.   Each  of  these  alternatives  allows federal  agencies  to  tailor  the  Section  106  process  to  meet  their  needs.    Alternate  procedures include Alternate Procedures; Programmatic Agreements; Prototype Programmatic Agreements; Exempted Categories; Standard Treatments; and Program Comments. Section  106,  NHPA—“The  head  of  any  Federal  agency  having  direct  or  indirect  jurisdiction over  a  proposed  Federal  or  federally  assisted  undertaking  in  any  State  and  the  head  of  any Federal  department  or  independent  agency  having  authority  to  license  any  undertaking  shall, prior to the approval of the expenditure of any Federal funds on the undertaking or prior to the issuance of any license, as the case may be, take into account the effect of the undertaking on any district,  site,  building,  structure,  or  object  that  is  included  in  or  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the National  Register.  The  head  of  any  such  Federal  agency  shall  afford  the  Advisory  Council  on Historic Preservation established under Title II of this Act a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to such undertaking.” Section  106  Process—The  series  of  actions  (including  consultation,  background  studies, surveys, resource identifications, assessments and treatments) that implement the section of the National Historic Preservation Act that requires federal agencies to take into account the effects of  their  undertakings  on  any  cultural  resources  or  historic  properties  that  meet  the  National Register  of  Historic  Places  criteria.    Part  of  this  process  involves  taking  action  to  avoid  or minimize harm to eligible resources (historic properties). Section  110  Guidelines—Guidance  for  establishing,  monitoring,  reviewing,  and  evaluating Federal  historic  preservation  programs.    Each  program  should  incorporate  provisions  of  other relevant  statutes,  such  as  AIRFA  and  NEPA.    Published  as  The  Secretary  of  the  Interior's Standards  and  Guidelines  for  Federal  Agency  Historic  Preservation  Programs  Pursuant  to Section  110  of  the  National  Historic  Preservation  Act,  the  guidelines  define  the  required components of a sound federal historic preservation program. Section  110  Inventories  and  Evaluations  (aka  Section  110  Surveys)—Archaeological  or historic  building  surveys  and  National  Register  evaluations  completed  IAW  NHPA  Section 110(a)(2)(A)  requirements  to  identify  historic  properties  on  agency  land  to  facilitate  good planning and streamline later Section 106 consultations.  Surveys and eligibility determinations for  Section  110  must  be  coordinated  with  SHPO/THPO  and  other  appropriate  parties  for concurrence  to  ensure  future  applicability  to  Section  106  undertakings  that  occur  in  surveyed areas.  A key component to successful Section 110 surveys is recordkeeping. State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO)—The official appointed by the Governor of each State  and  territory  to  carry  out  the  functions  defined  in  the  NHPA,  and  to  administer  the  State AFI32-7065  19 NOVEMBER 2014 37 Historic  Preservation  Program.    SHPOs  provide  advice  and  assistance  to  federal  agencies regarding their  Cultural  Resources  Management  programs  and  historic  preservation responsibilities.  The NHPA has been amended over the years, with attendant changes to 36 CFR §Part 800, resulting in THPO most often being consulted concurrently with SHPO. Site—Location  of  an  event,  a  prehistoric  or  historic  occupation  or  activity,  or  a  building  or structure,  whether  standing,  ruined,  or  removed,  where  the  location  itself  maintains  historical, cultural,  or archeological  value and integrity.  Examples are battlefields,  historic campgrounds, ancient trails or gathering places, deposits  of cultural  debris (i.e. middens or trash dumps), and historic homesteads and farms. (TCRs/TCPs)—TCRs  are  sites,  districts, Traditional  Cultural  Resources/Properties buildings,  structures,  or  objects  associated  with  cultural  practices  or  beliefs  of  a  living community that are rooted in the history of the community, and are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.  TCRs may be determined eligible for the NRHP, and  as  such,  are  considered  under  the  36  C.F.R.  Part800  process  as  TCPs.    Examples  of TCRs/TCPs  include:  1)  locations  where  Native  American  or  other  groups  traditionally  gather wild foods or medicines; 2) ethnic neighborhoods whose cultural character is important to those who  live  in  them;  3)  rural  landscapes  reflecting  traditional  patterns  of  agriculture  or  social interaction; and 4) landforms associated with Native American traditions and religious practices.  (TCRs/TCPs)—TCRs  are  sites,  districts, Traditional  Cultural  Resources/Properties buildings,  structures,  or  objects  associated  with  cultural  practices  or  beliefs  of  a  living community that are rooted in the history of the community, and are important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of the community.  TCRs may be determined eligible for the NRHP, and as such,  are considered under the Section 106 process  as TCPs.  Examples of TCRs/TCPs include:  1) locations where  Native American or  other  groups traditionally  gather  wild  foods or medicines;  2)  ethnic  neighborhoods  whose  cultural  character  is  important  to  those  who  live  in them; 3) rural landscapes reflecting traditional patterns of agriculture or social interaction; and 4) landforms associated with Native American traditions and religious practices.  Tribal  Historic  Preservation  Officer  (THPO)—The  official  appointed  by  an  Indian  Tribe  in accordance with 54 U.S.C. §302702 to administer the Tribal Historic Preservation Program and assume duties and functions for tribal lands similar to those that the SHPO has for other lands.  The Secretary of Interior designates Tribes with  THPO responsibilities.
