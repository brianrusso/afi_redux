SECTION A - GENERAL INFORMATION  1.  Purpose of the CFETP.  This CFETP provides information necessary for the AFCFM, MAJCOM functional managers (MFMs), commanders, training managers, supervisors and trainers to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective and efficient career field training program.  This plan outlines the training that individuals in AFSC 2A5X4A/B/C/D/E and F should receive in order to develop and progress throughout their career.  This CFETP identifies initial skill, upgrade, qualification, advanced and proficiency training.  Initial skills training is the AFS specific training an individual receives upon entry into the Air Force or upon retraining into this specialty for award of the 3-skill level.  This training is conducted at various locations by AETC.  Upgrade training identifies the mandatory courses, task qualification requirements, and correspondence course completion requirements for award of the 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-skill levels.  Qualification training is actual hands-on task performance training designed to 3  qualify an Airman in a specific duty position.  This training program occurs both during and after the upgrade training process.  It is designed to provide the performance skills and knowledge required to do the job.  Advanced training is formal specialty training used for selected Airmen.  Proficiency training is additional training, either in-residence or exportable advanced training courses, or OJT, provided to personnel to increase their skills and knowledge beyond the minimum required for upgrade.  The CFETP has several purposes:  1.1.  Serves as a management tool to plan, manage, conduct, and evaluate a career field-training program.  Also, it is used to help supervisors identify training at the appropriate point in an individual’s career.  1.2.  Identifies tasks and knowledge training requirements for each skill level in the specialty and recommends education and training throughout each phase of an individual's career.  1.3.  Lists training courses that are available in the specialty and identifies sources of training and the training delivery method.  1.4.  Identifies major resource constraints which impact full implementation of the desired career field training process.  2.  Use of the CFETP.  This plan will be used by MFMs and supervisors at all levels to ensure comprehensive and cohesive training programs are available for each individual in the specialty.  2.1.  AETC training personnel will develop or revise formal resident, non-resident, field, and exportable training based upon requirements established by the users and documented in Part II of the CFETP.  They will also work with the AFCFM to develop acquisition strategies for obtaining the resources needed to provide the identified training.  2.2.  MFMs will ensure their training programs complement the CFETP mandatory initial, upgrade, and proficiency requirements.  OJT, resident training, contract training, or exportable courses can satisfy these identified requirements.  MAJCOM-developed training, to support this AFSC, must be identified for inclusion in this plan and must not duplicate other available training resources.  2.3.  Each individual will complete the mandatory training requirements specified in this plan.  The list of courses in Part II will be used as a reference to support training.  3.  Coordination and Approval of the CFETP.  The AFCFM is the approval authority for the CFETP.  The AFCFM for AFSC 2A5X4 will initiate an annual review of this document to ensure currency and accuracy.  MAJCOM representatives and AETC training personnel will identify and coordinate on the career field training requirements.  Using the list of courses in Part II, they will eliminate duplicate training.  SECTION B - CAREER PROGRESSION INFORMATION  1.  Specialty Description:  4  1.1.  Specialty Summary.

Adequate training and timely progression from the apprentice to the superintendent skill level play an important role in the Air Force's ability to accomplish its mission.  It is essential that everyone involved in training do their part to plan, develop, manage, and conduct an effective training program.  The guidance provided in this part of the CFETP will ensure each individual receives viable training at appropriate points in their career.  Use Table 5.1 Enlisted Career Path in conjunction with information below to manage career field skill progression.  2.1.  Apprentice (3) Level.  Upon completion of initial skills training, a trainee will work with a trainer to enhance their knowledge and skills.  They will utilize the CDC, task qualification training, and available exportable courses for continued advancement.  Once task certified, a trainee may perform the task unsupervised.  The 1- and 3-skill levels are assigned shred identifiers for initial-skills course scheduling and assignment purposes.  Shred identifiers and Special Experience Identifiers (SEI) codes are provided in the AFECD.  2.2.  Journeyman (5) Level.  Individuals must complete formal 5-level OJT.  This training involves completion of CDC 2AX5X (as identified in STS Attachment 2), as well as completion of all identified Core Task qualification training requirements.  Available proficiency/supplementary training should be completed as early as duty permits.  5-levels are assigned shred identifiers for scheduling and assignment purposes, and may be assigned job positions such as quality assurance and various staff positions.  5-levels will be considered for appointment as unit trainers.  Individuals will use their CDCs to prepare for testing under the Weighted Airman Promotion System (WAPS).  They should continue their education toward an associate’s or higher educational degree from the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF) or other accredited institution.  2.3.  Craftsman (7) Level.  Individuals must complete formal 7-level OJT.  This training involves completion of CDC 2AX7X (as identified in STS Attachment A), as well as completion of all identified Core Task qualification training requirements.  Available proficiency/supplementary training should be completed as early as duty permits.  A craftsman can expect to fill various supervisory and management positions such as shift leader, element NCOIC, flight/section chief, and task certifier.  They can also be assigned to work in staff positions.  They should continue their education toward an associate’s or higher educational degree from CCAF or other accredited institution.  Once promoted to TSgt, the shred identifier drops from the Control AFSC (CAFSC) and the individual can be assigned to other refuel/bomber aircraft. 5   2.4.  Superintendent (9) Level.  Individuals promoted to SMSgt may be required to attend the Senior Noncommissioned Officer Academy.  Additional training in the areas of budget, manpower, resources, and personnel management should be pursued through continuing education.  Completion of college courses in the pursuit of a higher-level educational degree is also recommended.  Once promoted to SMSgt, an individual can be assigned to any airlift, special mission, refuel, bomber, helicopter, or tilt rotor aircraft unit.  3.  Training Decisions.  The CFETP uses a building block approach (simple to complex) to encompass the entire spectrum of training requirements for the Refuel/Bomber Aircraft Maintenance (2A5X4) career field.  The spectrum includes a strategy for when, where, and how to meet these training requirements.  The strategy must be apparent and affordable to reduce duplication of training and eliminate a disjointed approach to training.  The following training decisions were made by the MFMs and SMEs at the career field U&TW held 7 through 11 March 2016 at Sheppard AFB, TX.  3.1.  Initial Skills.  Changes were made to initial skills training.  Several STS line items not identified previously were identified for inclusion in the Mission-Design-Series (MDS) specific STS attachments and proficiency codes were assigned.  3.2.  5-Level Upgrade Requirements.  Changes were made to 5-level Core Task upgrade requirements.  Airmen will be required to complete the 2AX5X CDC and FTDs will provide advanced aircraft system training.  3.3.  7-Level Upgrade Requirements.  Changes were made to 7-level Core Task upgrade requirements.  New SSgts will complete the 2AX7X CDC and FTDs will provide advanced aircraft system training.  3.4.  Proficiency/Continuation Training.  Additional knowledge and skill requirements, which are not taught through initial skills or upgrade training are accomplished by unit training or FTD.  The purpose of continuation training is to provide additional training, exceeding minimum upgrade training requirements, with emphasis on present and future duty positions.  To provide additional training in this area, MAJCOMs must develop a continuation training program that ensures individuals in the aerospace maintenance career field receive the necessary training at the appropriate point in their career.  The training program will identify both mandatory and optional training requirements.  Refer to Part II, Section D, Training Course Index, of this CFETP for a listing of available AETC supplementary training courses.  4.  CCAF/Higher Education and Advanced Certification Opportunities.

These STS attachments will be used for technical training provided by AETC for classes beginning after 4 January 2017.  2.  Purpose.  As prescribed in AFI 36-2201, this STS:  2.1.  Column 1 (Task, Knowledge, and Technical Reference) lists the most common tasks, knowledge, and technical references (TR) necessary for Airmen to perform duties in the 3-, 5-, and 7-skill level.  2.2.  Column 2 (Core Tasks) identifies, by asterisk (*), specialty-wide training requirements.  Core Tasks identified with an *R are optional for the AFRC Traditional Reservist (TR) and the ANG Drill Status Guardsman (DSG), for full-time members, Core Tasks are required.  As a minimum, certification on all AFCFM directed Core Tasks applicable to the specialty must be completed for skill level upgrade.  Exemptions:  2.2.1.  Core Tasks that are not applicable to base assigned aircraft or equipment are not required for upgrade (units are not required to send personnel TDY for Core Task training).  2.2.2.  For units with more than one MDS aircraft, upgrade trainees need only complete Core Tasks on a single MDS.  MFMs, unit commanders, and/or supervisors may require trainees to complete Core Task training on additional MDS aircraft, if desired.  If some of these Core Tasks involve training in another unit on base, trainees must still complete all Core Tasks relevant to at least one MDS aircraft.  All units are bound by the requirements in this CFETP and will accommodate Core Task trainees from other units.  2.3.  Column 3 (Certification for OJT) provides certification for OJT and is used to record completion of tasks and knowledge training requirements.  Use IMDS/G081 or TBA to document technician qualifications, if available.  Task certification must show a certification or completed date.  2.4.  Column 4 (Proficiency Codes) shows formal training and correspondence course requirements.  Also shows the proficiency to be demonstrated on the job by the graduate as a result of training on the task and knowledge and the career knowledge provided by the correspondence course.  3.  Qualitative Requirements.  Attachment 1 contains the proficiency code key used to indicate the level of training and knowledge provided by resident training and career development courses.   4.  Job Qualification Standard.  The STS becomes a Job Qualification Standard (JQS) for OJT when placed in AF Form 623, On-The-Job Training Record, and used according to AFI 36-2201.  For OJT, the tasks in column 1 are trained and qualified to the go/no go level.  "Go" means the individual can perform the task without assistance and meets local requirements for accuracy, timeliness, and correct procedures.  When used as a JQS, the following requirements apply:  15  4.1.  Documentation.  Document and certify completion of training IAW AFI 36-2201.  Units converted to TBA will use this system to document training.  IMDS or G081 will continue to be used to document ancillary training and other training currently maintained in these data systems.  Use of Part II and Attachments 1 and 2 of this CFETP are mandatory in individual training records where paper training records are the primary method of documenting training.  4.1.1.  Transcribing from Old CFETP to New CFETP.  All AFJQSs and previous CFETPs are replaced by this CFETP; therefore, transcribing of all training records to this CFETP STS is mandatory.  Use this CFETP STS (or automated STS) to identify and certify all past and current qualifications.  Document and certify all previous and current training IAW AFI 36-2201.  5.  STS.  A guide for development of promotion tests used in the WAPS catalog.  Specialty Knowledge Tests (SKTs) are developed at the AETC Airman Advancement Division, by Senior NCOs with extensive practical experience in their career fields.  The tests sample knowledge of STS subject matter areas judged by test development team members as most appropriate for promotion to higher grades.  Questions are based upon study references listed in the WAPS catalog.  Individual responsibilities are in AFI 36-2605, Air Force Military Personnel Testing System.  WAPS is not applicable to the Air National Guard or Air Force Reserve.  6.  Recommendations.  Report unsatisfactory performance of individual course graduates to the AETC training manager at 362 TRS, 613 10th Ave, Sheppard AFB TX, 76311-2352, DSN 736-5205.  Please reference specific STS paragraphs.  SECTION B - COURSE OBJECTIVE LIST (COL)  1.  Introduction.  Each proficiency coded STS task or knowledge item taught at the technical school is measured through the use of an objective.  An objective is a written instruction for the student so he or she knows what is expected of them to successfully complete training on each task.  Each objective is comprised of a condition, behavior, and standard that states what is expected of the student for each task.  The condition is the setting in which the training takes place (i.e. TOs, type of equipment, etc.).  The behavior is the observable portion of the objective (i.e. perform an operational check).  The standard is the level of performance that is measured to ensure the STS proficiency code level is attained.  AETC course objectives and associated information are published in the Plan of Instruction (POI) for each of the courses identified in Section D, below, Training Course Index.  2.  Measurement.  Each objective is indicated as follows:  W indicates task or subject knowledge, which is measured using a written test.  PC indicates required task performance, which is measured with a performance progress check.  PC/W indicates separate measurement of both knowledge and performance elements using a written test and a performance progress check.  3.  Standard.  The minimum standard for written examinations is 70%.  Standards for performance measurement are indicated in the objective and delineated on the individual progress check checklist.  The checklist is used by the instructor to document each student’s progress, on each task.  Instructor assistance is provided as needed during the progress check, and students may be required to repeat all or part of the behavior until satisfactory performance is attained.  Students must satisfactorily complete all PCs prior to taking the written test. 16  4.  Proficiency Level.  Review column 4A of the STS to determine the proficiency level of a particular task or knowledge item.  Review the course objective list to determine which STS item the objective supports.  Review the proficiency code key in the STS Attachment 1 of this CFETP for an explanation of the proficiency codes.  Most task performance is taught to the “2b” proficiency level which means the students can do most parts of the task, but does need assistance on the hardest parts of the task (partially proficient).  The student can also determine step-by-step procedures for doing the task.  For tasks that are taught to the “3c” proficiency level, students can do all parts of the task and only require a spot check on completed work (competent).  The student can also identify why and when a task must be done and why each step is needed.  5.  Course Objectives List.  A detailed listing of initial skills or craftsman courses are listed in Section D tables 2.1 and 2.2 and a complete list of objectives may be obtained by submitting a written request to the identified course OPR in Section D, paragraph 1.
