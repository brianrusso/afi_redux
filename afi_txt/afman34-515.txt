CUSTOMS AND DRILL  Chapter 1 INTRODUCTION  Section 1A—Background 1.1.  Purpose.    The purpose of drill is to enable an Officer or NCO to move his unit from one place  to  another  in  an  orderly  manner,  to  aid  in  disciplinary  training  by  instilling  habits  of precision and response to the leader’s orders; and to provide for the development of all Airmen in the practice of leading troops.  1.2.  Origin.   The origins of drill can be traced back to Greek times when their armies were the first  to  group their men  into  compact  formations, known as phalanxes.  The phalanxes enabled the Greeks to use a synergistic method of fighting, allowing them to bear the maximum amount of force at the appropriate time of the battle.  This method of fighting proved to be so successful that by the 18th century all military units around the world used some form of drill.  1.3.  History.    Drill in the United States can be traced to the Revolutionary War, when leaders of this country were confronted with the problem of not only establishing a government but also organizing  an  army  that  was  already  engaged  in  conflict.    For  the  first  three  years  of  fighting, Revolutionary forces endured many hardships and suffered loss after loss to the superior British forces.    These  hardships  and  losses  mostly  stemmed  from  the  lack  of  military  atmosphere  in country.    Thus,  an  army  was  created  with  little  or  no  organization,  control,  discipline,  or teamwork.  1.3.1.  Recognizing  the  crisis,  General  Washington,  through  Benjamin  Franklin,  the American Ambassador to France, enlisted the aid of a Prussian officer, Baron Friedrich von Steuben. Upon his arrival at Valley Forge on 23 February 1778, von Steuben, a former staff officer with Frederick the Great, met an army of several thousand half-starved, wretched men in rags. He commented that a European army could not be kept together in such a state. To correct the conditions that prevailed, he set to work immediately and wrote drill movements and regulations at night and taught them the following day to a model company of 100 men selected from the line.  1.3.2.  Discipline became a part of military life for these selected individuals as they learned to  respond  to  command  without  hesitation.  This  new  discipline  instilled  in  the  individual  a sense  of  alertness,  urgency,  and  attention  to  detail.  Confidence  in  himself  and  his  weapon grew  as  each  man  perfected  the  fifteen  1-second  movements  required  to  load  and  fire  his musket.  As  the  Americans  mastered  the  art  of  drill,  they  began  to  work  as  a  team  and  to develop a sense of pride in themselves and in their unit.  1.3.3.  Watching  this  model  company  drill,  observers  were  amazed  to  see  how  quickly  and orderly the troops could be massed and maneuvered into different battle formations. Officers observed that organization, chain of command, and control were improved as each man had a specific place and task within the formation. Later, the members of the model company were AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 39 distributed  throughout  the  Army  to  teach  drill.  Through  drill,  they  improved  the  overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Army.  1.3.4.  To  ensure  continuity  and  uniformity,  von  Steuben,  by  then  a  major  general  and  the Army Inspector General, wrote the first Army field manual in 1779, The Regulations for the Order and Discipline of  the Troops of the  United States, commonly  referred to  as the  Blue Book. The drill procedures initiated at Valley Forge were not changed for 85 years, until the American Civil War, and many of the drill terms and procedures are still in effect today.  1.3.5.  Drill commands are about the same as at the time of the War of 1812, except that then the officers and noncommissioned officers began them by saying, “Take care to face to the right,  right,  face.”  Also,  during  the  American  revolutionary  period,  troops  marched  at  a cadence  of  76  steps  a  minute  instead  of  the  current  cadence  of  120  steps.  Then  units performed precise movement on the battlefield,  and the army that  could  perform them best was often able to get behind the enemy, or on his flank, and thus beat him. Speed spoiled the winning exactness. Also, firearms did not shoot far or accurately in 1776, so troop formations could take more time to approach the enemy.  1.3.6.  As  armament  and  weaponry  improved,  drill  had  to  adapt  to  new  tactical  concepts. Although the procedures  taught  in  drill  today are not  normally employed  on the battlefield, the  objectives  accomplished  by  drill—professionalism,  teamwork,  confidence,  pride, alertness,  attention  to  detail,  esprit  de  corps,  and  discipline—are  just  as  important  to  the modern military as they were to the Continental Army.  Section 1B—Honor Guards 1.4.  Purpose.    Honor  guards  are  simply  guards  assigned  to  ceremonial  duty,  specifically  to escort  the  deceased  during  a  military  funeral.    They  represent  an  organization  in  ceremonial functions  and  are  charged  with  representing  all  members,  both  past  and  present,  of  that organization.    Honor  guards  are  usually  experts  in  military  drill,  ceremonies  and  protocol.    To ensure  success  and  remain  an  “icon  of  excellence,”  Air  Force  honor  guards  must  promote  the mission,  protect  the  standards,  perfect  the  image  and  preserve  the  heritage.    The  primary missions of the USAF and Base level honor guard programs are to employ, equip, and train Air Force members to provide professional military funeral honors for active duty, retired members, and veterans of the United States Air Force.  Figure 1.1.  United States Air Force Honor Guard Seal   1.5.  Origin.    From  the  earliest  periods  of  human  history,  man  has  fought  in  battles,  conflicts and wars.  No matter how small the army, society or tribe, each had leaders who required extra 40 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 protection.    It  is  out  of  these  leaders  need  for  security  that  the  first  honor  guard  was  created.  Because they desired protection they screened and selected their best soldiers to be their personal guards.    Most  notable  of  these  elite  protectorates  is  the  Praetorian  Guard.    Considered  the original  honor  guard  of  the  western  world,  these  elite  members  of  the  Roman  Army  were assigned as the personal body guards of several Roman Emperors beginning with Julius Caesar.  1.6.  History.    In  order  to  demonstrate  the  drill  proficiency  and  new  found  discipline  in  the Continental Army, select units made up of the best soldiers were formed.  It is believed that these men  were  selected  due  to  their  size,  strength  and  their  proven  combat  abilities.    These handpicked units were the first  honor  guards in  the U.S.   Today, honor  guards are selected for their  military  appearance,  professionalism,  superior  discipline  and  records  of  outstanding performance.  Section 1C—Military Music 1.7.  Background.    The  earliest  surviving  pictorial,  sculptured,  and  written  records  show musical or quasi-musical instruments employed in connection with military activity for signaling during encampments, parades, and combat.  Because the sounds were produced in the open air, the instruments tended to be brass and percussion types.  Oriental, Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and American  Indian  chronicles  and  pictorial  remains  show  trumpets  and  drums  of  many  varieties allied to soldiers and battles.  1.8.  Reference.    Ceremonial music plays an important role in today’s military.  Please refer to AFMAN  35-106,  Ceremonial  Music,  for  guidance  on  Air  Force  Bands,  ceremonies,  and  how music is used to signal honor guards to perform certain manuals and movements.  Section 1D—Military Funerals 1.9.  Background.    Since  prehistoric  times,  man  has  honored  the  dead  with  some  type  of ceremony.    Various  rituals  have  evolved  throughout  history  to  become  part  of  the  modern  day funeral.  1.9.1.  Funeral  Types.    There  are  several  types  of  funerals.    Traditional,  Memorial, Combined, Graveside and Non-commemorative funerals.  1.9.1.1.  Traditional  Services.    These  services  usually  include  one  or  more  visitations where the mourners gather, with the body present, to express condolences.  A service to commemorate the life of the deceased is held typically at a funeral home chapel, place of worship,  cemetery  chapel,  graveside  or  at  a  home.    A  procession  to  the  cemetery  may also take place.  1.9.1.2.  Memorial  Services.    These  services  are  used  to  commemorate  the  life  of  the deceased  when  the  body  is  not  present.    They  can  be  performed  before  and/or  after  the body is interred (burial) or inured (cremate).  1.9.1.3.  Combined Services.  These combine both traditional and memorial services.  An example  of  this  is  when  memorial  services  are  held  by  mourners  living  in  other  cities where the burial is not taking place.  1.9.1.4.  Graveside  Services.    These  commemorative  services  are  held  beside  the  grave immediately prior to burial.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 41 1.9.1.5.  Non-commemorative  Funerals.    These  are  also  known  as  direct  dispositions.  There is no formal service to remember the life that has passed.  1.9.2.  Visitation (Wake).   Visitation periods (Wake) have their roots in ancient times when it was customary to  watch over the deceased for varying lengths  of time before burial.  The custom  of  continuously  watching  arose  because  there  was  hope  that  the  deceased  might regain consciousness, as well as concern about someone being buried alive. The practice also fulfilled a psychological  need by gradually conditioning family and friends to the reality of the death.  Today, visitations are typically held at a funeral home that provides the facilities, seating and staff to accommodate a viewing and a gathering of people. During visiting hours, mourners  come  to  offer  their  condolences  to  the  family  and  pay  their  respects  to  the deceased.  The  casket  may  be  open  or  closed  and  is  usually  displayed  with  floral arrangements that have been received and memorial presentations, if any.  The number and length of visitation periods varies depending upon religious or cultural customs and personal preference. A typical visitation of 2 to 4 hours can be held prior to the funeral on the same day or the day before. Full day visitations can also be held one or more days preceding the funeral.      There  are  differing  views  on  the  role  of  an  open  casket.  Many  feel  it  is  an unbecoming  and  uncomfortable  practice,  preferring  to  remember  the  deceased  as  he  or  she was in life, not in death. However, many experts on grief and mourning believe that viewing the body is an important step in beginning to heel because it causes mourners to confront the reality of death. Of course, religious customs also dictate whether  or not there should be an open casket.  In Armed Forces Funerals, the term wake is replaced with lying in repose or to “lying in state’ if the visitation period takes place in a principal government building.  Here, honor  guards  perform  Guard  of  Honor  duty  24  hours  a  day  for  the  duration  of  time  the individual is to lay in repose.  Figure 1.2.  Presidents John F. Kennedy and Gerald Ford Lay in State in the Capitol Rotunda   42 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 1.3.  Military Honor Guards Perform Guard of Honor Duty while President Ronald Reagan Lies in State   1.9.3.  Special  Ceremonies  (Rites).    Some  organizations  have  their  own  unique  rites  for members  who  have  died.    The  rites  can  be  conducted  separately  or  included  in  traditional services.  Examples are Free & Accepted Masons, American Legion, Knights of Columbus, Elks, Moose and of course the U.S. Military.  1.9.4.  Military  Funeral  Honors  (MFH).    Services  rendered  during  a  military  funeral  are referred to as honors.  A military funeral can consist of a variety of honors in many different combinations.  Refer to AFI 34-242, Chapter 8 for guidance regarding MFH entitlements and requirements.  DODI 1300.15 provides additional guidance; Air Force honor guards must be thoroughly  familiar  with  these  instructions.    Eligibility  for  burial  in  Arlington  National Cemetery  (ANC)  is  covered  by  32  CFR  553  and  Army  Regulation  290-5.      Flyovers, Personal Colors Bearers (PC), an Air Force Chaplain and other elements may be added to all of the below categories as required.  Air Force funeral honors are categorized as follows:  1.9.4.1.  Dependent Funerals.  Dependents of military veterans, members and retirees are authorized  honor  guard  pallbearers  during  funerals  in  ANC.  Honor  guards  will  not support dependent funerals outside of ANC.  1.9.4.2.  Minimum  Honors  Funerals.    This  category  entails  the  minimum  honors mandated  by  congress.  The  Air  Force  uses  the  2  or  3-person  funeral  sequence  for  all military members who did not retire with 20 or more  years of service. These sequences are not performed in ANC.  Installation honor guards are permitted to use this sequence for retired military members if manning and mission dictate.  1.9.4.2.1.  Honors consist of a flag fold and the playing of Taps. For inurned remains, the detail will also act as pallbearers. See Figure A4.1. for gravesite layout.  1.9.4.3.  Standard  Honors  Funerals  (SHF).    This  category  entails  the  standard  funeral honors  performed  by  the  Air  Force.    Retired  members  that  are  not  eligible  for  a  Full Honors Funeral (FHF) receive these honors.    A  color team  is added if the member was Active  Duty  (AD),  Repatriated  or  a  Medal  of  Honor  Recipient.    The  sequence  may  be modified  based  on  the  manning  available.    All  SHFs  performed  outside  of  ANC  are Modified  SHFs.    The  approved  modified  sequence  consists  of  seven  ceremonial guardsmen  and  is  performed  across  the  Air  Force  for  retired  Air  Force  members.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 43 Historically,  modified  SHFs  have  also  been  performed  using  a  5  or  10-person  team, however  these  sequences  are  no  longer  authorized.    See  Figure  A4.2.  and  A4.3.  for gravesite layouts.  1.9.4.3.1.  In most cases honors consist of a pallbearer team, the firing of volleys, flag fold and the playing of Taps.  1.9.4.3.2.  For AD deaths, repatriations or Medal of Honor Recipients, within ANC, a color  team  will  be  added  to  the  standard  honors.    See  Figure  A4.4.  for  gravesite layout.  1.9.4.4.  Full  Honors  Funeral.    The  FHF  consist  of  the  maximum  honors  that  honor guards may perform.  All AD Deaths, Repatriations and Medal of Honor Recipients will receive the full honors allotted outside ANC.  (See Figure A4.4)..  For the USAF Honor Guard,  FHFs  are  only  performed  within  ANC  and  offer  additional  honors  such  as  an Arlington  Lady  who  represents  the  CSAF,  an  escort  for  the  Arlington  Lady,  the  USAF Band,  Caisson  transfer/procession,  and  military  escort/formation.    For  additional information to http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil.  and  honors  provided refer regarding  ANC requirements 1.9.4.4.1.  Honors consist of a color team, pallbearer team, the firing of volleys, flag fold and the playing of Taps.  1.9.4.4.2.  For  a  FHF,  a  caisson  is  used  during  the  procession  and  escorted  by  the USAF Band and an honor guard formation.  The formation varies in size depending on  the  rank  of  the  individual  and  manning  available.    The  standard  size  flight  is eighteen  Airman  but  has  occasionally  been  reduced  to  fifteen  or  even  twelve.  Funerals  for  General  Officers  are  entitled  to  two  formations.    Flight  size  can  be adjusted depending on the rank of the General.  The largest formation consists of two 27-person flights and is authorized for former CSAFs.  See Figure A4.5. for gravesite layout.  1.9.5.  Armed  Forces  Honors  (Joint  Service  Funerals).    These  unique  funerals  represent the  highest  honors  an  American  may  receive  from  the  Armed  Services.    These  missions require a large number of personnel and resources.  Army Pamphlet 1-1 and AFDWI 34-101, Ceremonial  Resource Support  provides instructions and authorized honors for these funeral types.  1.9.5.1.  Special  Military  Funeral.    The  SECDEF,  Deputy  SECDEF,  Former  SECDEF, Secretary  of  the  Army,  Navy  or  Air  Force,  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  Five Star Generals and Fleet Admirals, Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, CSAF,  Commandant  of  the  Marine  Corps  and  Commandant  of  the  Coast  Guard  are entitled  to  a  Special  Military  Funeral.    In  addition,  other  individuals  designated  by  the SECDEF and foreign military personnel designated by the POTUS are eligible.  1.9.5.2.  Official  Funeral.    The  VPOTUS,  Chief  Justice  of  the  US  Supreme  Court  and Cabinet  Members  are  entitled  to  an  Official  Funeral.    In  addition,  other  Government officials when specifically designated by  the POTUS and foreign  civil  dignitaries when specifically designated by the POTUS.  44 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 1.9.5.3.  State Funeral.  The POTUS, a former POTUS, or POTUS-elect are entitled to a state  funeral.    Any  other  person  specifically  designated  by  the  POTUS  may  be  given these honors.  Section 1E—USAF and Base Honor Guard 1.10.  History.    The USAF Honor Guard traces its beginning to May 1948 when Headquarters Command, USAF developed plans for an elite ceremonial unit comparable to those of the other Armed Services.  As a result, a ceremonial unit was activated within the Air Police Squadron in September, 1948 with an authorized strength of 98 airmen and 2 officers.  However, because of transfers  and  personnel  attrition,  it  wasn’t  until  March  1949  that  sufficient  personnel  were assigned to enable the unit to function.  The ceremonial detachment continued to be assigned to the Air Police Squadron, which in the course of several re-designations eventually evolved into the  1100th  Security  Police  Squadron,  until  December  1971.    On  1  January  1972,  the  USAF Honor Guard came into its own as a separate unit and was authorized 147 airmen and 3 officers.  1.10.1.  The unit was constituted “USAF Honor Guard” on 26 July 1971 and activated on 1 January 1972.  1.10.2.  The Base Honor Guard can trace its origins from this same history.  The unit that was activated  within  the  1100th  Air  Police  Squadron  was,  essentially,  the  first  Air  Force  Base Honor  Guard.    The  remaining  installations  across  the  Air  Force  utilized  security  forces personnel, volunteers and the “Base Detail” system to fill ceremony requirements.  This led to little or no standardization across the service as each base evolved and developed its own procedures.  1.10.3.  On  10  November  1989  the  Air  Force  approved  AFR  900-37  which  provided planning, training and use of installation honor guards.  This regulation provided a structure similar  to  what  is  in  place  today  by  giving  oversight  of  the  installation  honor  guard  to  the installation  commander  and  aligning  the  program  under  the  Services  squadron.    This restructure  opened  the  door  for  future  standardization  and  program  improvements.    The guidance was updated on 19 July 1994 and renamed AFI 34-503, USAF Base Honor Guard Program.  Later it was rescinded and incorporated into AFI 34-242, AF Mortuary Affairs.  1.10.4.  On  1  October  1996,  the  USAF  Honor  Guard  officially  formalized  its  training program  when it created the USAF Honor Guard Technical  Training School  located on the honor  guard  campus  at  Bolling  AFB.    As  part  of  this  formalization  the  Base  Honor  Guard Training  Program  was  stood  up  and  two  formal  courses  were  developed  in  order  to standardize all honor guards throughout the Air Force.  The goal is for all Airmen performing honor  guard  duties  to  perform  ceremonies  to  the  same  standard,  in  the  same  manner, following  the  same  procedures  and  to  meet  the  same  dress/appearance  requirements regardless of location.  1.10.5.  The  first  Mobile  Training  Course  was  conducted  in  1999  at  Hickam  AFB,  HI providing  training  to  Base  Honor  Guard  members  from  several  Pacific  Air  Forces installations.  1.11.  Emblem.    SMSgt  Malcolm  Haynes,  former  superintendent  of  the  USAF  Honor  Guard, was the first to design and draft the USAF Honor Guard emblem.  Under the guidance of Captain Marcel  Mayer,  former  Commander,  SrA  Scott  Stuart  designed  the  final  version  of  the  emblem AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 45 and it was approved on 4 October 1976.  The emblem is composed of crossed rifles silhouetted over  a  silver  gray  Roman  helmet,  complete  with  a  scarlet  red  horsehair  festoon,  on  a  field  of ultramarine blue with the attached organizational motto.  The color of the lettering and the border of the design are Air Force yellow.  The roman helmet is symbolic of the Praetorian Guard of the western world.  The red festoon denotes courage and valor.  The silver gray of the helmet proper is  for  excellence  desired  of  the  honor  guard  personnel.    The  crossed  rifles  denote  the  USAF Honor  Guard’s  primary  weapon.    The  ultramarine  blue  background  symbolizes  the  primary theater  of  Air  Force  operations;  the  sky  and  beyond.    The  attached  motto,  “To  Honor  With Dignity,” best represents the mission of the USAF Honor Guard.  Figure 1.4.  Evolution of the USAF Honor Guard Squadron Emblem.   1.11.1.  The emblem was revised on 23 February 2011 to meet the requirements outlined in AFI 84-105.  1.11.2.  The  Base  Honor  Guard,  due  to  being  a  program  and  not  a  numbered  or  named squadron does not have an approved/official Air Force emblem.  1.11.3.  The honor guard duty badges’ designs are based off this emblem.  1.12.  Charges.    Like  many  organizations  the  members  of  the  honor  guard  utilize  charges  to epitomize the pride and ethos of their profession.  Charges in the Air Force are synonymous with creeds.  1.12.1.  USAF  (Base  Honor  Guard)  Charge.    All  honor  guard  members  must  learn, memorize  and  be  able  to  recite  verbatim  the  honor  guard  Charge.    The  “creed”  as  it  was previously known was revised in 1999.  The original version read as follows:  1.12.2.  I am a proud member of the United States Air Force honor guard.  My standards of conduct  and high level  of professionalism  place  me above all others in  my service.   I have earned the right to wear the ceremonial uniform; one of which is honored in a rich tradition and history.  I am superbly conditioned to perfect all movements throughout every drill and ceremony.    The  level  at  which  I  perform  will  never  be  dictated  by  the  type  of  ceremony, severity of temperature, nor the size of the crowd.  I am constantly driven to excel by a strong sense of dedication that runs deeper than patriotism.  While on ceremonies I stand sharp and crisp, motionless by choice, for I have voluntarily chosen to represent every member past and present of the United States Air Force.  I am a ceremonial guardsman!  46 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 1.5.  USAF/Base Honor Guard Charge.  Handpicked to serve as a member of the United States Air Force Honor Guard(see Note), my standards of conduct and level of professionalism must be above reproach, for I represent all others in my service.  Others earned the right for me to wear the ceremonial uniform, one that is honored in a rich tradition and history.  I will honor their memory by wearing it properly and proudly.  Never will I allow my performance to be dictated by the type of ceremony, severity of the temperature, or size of the crowd.  I will remain superbly conditioned to perfect all movements throughout every drill and ceremony.  Obligated by my oath I am constantly driven to excel by a deep devotion to duty and a strong sense of dedication.  Representing every member, past and present, of the United States Air Force, I vow to stand sharp, crisp, and motionless, for I am a ceremonial guardsman! NOTE: Installation honor guards will recite the first line of the Honor Guard Charge as follows:  “…member of the (Installation Name) Base Honor Guard.”  For example, “…member of the Elmendorf Base Honor Guard, my standards…” 1.12.3.  Flight/Element  Charges.    Charges  also  exist  for  the  three  primary  performance elements of the honor guard; bearers, colors and firing party.  Figure 1.6.  Bearers Charge  Body bearing is an art, one which encompasses heart, knowledge, strength and dedication.  Every movement is crisp, precise and well-rehearsed, for we are a team and together we are one.  Appearance is important, for not only do we represent ourselves, but also each member, past and present of the United States Air Force.  Regardless of the weight of the casket or the distance of the carry, the casket will remain level.  Effortless is our expression shown on every job, for we are prepared for the task at hand.  Reliable - we will be the last to let you down.  Second to none, except for the one above! AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 47 Figure 1.7.  Colors Charge  Confident and proud, we carry the emblems of our freedom and liberty.  Outstanding performances are the hallmark of our dedication and devotion to duty.  Loyal troops we strive to be; to our nation, to our service, to our guard, and to each other.  Observantly we learn from those who have gone before; we seek to make their perfection our own.  Respectively we honor the traditions that have made us what we are; we embrace them with a vigorous spirit.  Superbly we fulfill our mission; to present and protect the Colors with the utmost in reverence and pride. Figure 1.8.  Firing Party Charge  We, a party of seven, gathered as one, to render honors unto those who have passed on. Standing in the distance, ready to fire, in memory of one who has served with honor. Three volleys are fired, clearing a way, for the soul to follow on this final day. Planting another flower in the garden of stone, seven shots in unison, a farewell to our own. A final salute to our uniformed member, this lifetime of service we'll always remember. Firing party, a job with pride, always to be seen, firing party, we are a team! Section 1F—Overview 1.13.  Scope.    This manual covers the basic terms, instruction techniques, drill and ceremonies that are unique to Air Force honor guards.  Honor guards will adhere to all drill movements and procedures described in AFI 34-1201, AFMAN 36-2203 and AFPAM 34-1202 unless instructed otherwise by this manual.  1.13.1.  When  used  with  the  above  Air  Force  level  publications,  this  manual  should  meet most  of  the  honor  guard’s  needs,  however  it  does  not  cover  every  situation  that  may  arise.  For  unique  situations,  knowing  and  understanding  the  purpose  and  history  of  a  movement, tradition or procedure can usually provide the solution.  1.14.  Terms.   The following terms are unique to Air Force honor guards:  1.14.1.  Beast.    The act  of creating a distinct, audible sound by gripping, hitting or tapping the weapon during a drill movement. NOTE:  Whenever the hand leaves the weapon at a fist in  order  to  beast  it  will  be  clenched  with  the  thumb  wrapped  around;  touching  and perpendicular to the index and middle finger (Refer to Figure 1.8.).  The angle of the arm will always  be  at  the  same  angle  required  upon  completion  of  the  beast.    For  example,  during present arms the left arm is at a 90-degree angle upon completion of the movement so during the “and” count the left arm will move to a 90-degree angle when brought off the weapon to beast.  48 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 1.9.  Hand at a Fist (Beast)   1.14.2.  Butt  Slam.    The act of slamming the weapon to the ground on the heel of the butt stock.  This is required for many basic, intermediate and advanced rifle drill manuals.NOTE:  Never butt slam at the gravesite portion of a funeral, while on grass, wet surfaces or when otherwise directed by either a subdued command or other method.  1.14.3.  Cup  Hand.    The  technique  of  gripping  and/or  manipulating  the  weapon  with  the palm and fingers forming a “C” by placing the thumb along the index finger.  The thumb is not used to grip or wrap around the weapon.  Figure 1.10.  Cup Hand   1.14.4.  Dead  Step.    A  pause  during  a  sequence,  usually  a  marching  manual,  in  which  no movement is executed.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 49 1.14.5.  Flare Hand.   A “knife” hand in which the fingers are extended and joined with the thumb along the forefinger.  Figure 1.11.  Flare Hand   1.14.6.  Lock On.   The act of at least two individuals performing a weapons manual in sync with one another.  1.14.7.  Mark(s).   The spot in which an individual must suspend forward progress and/or be placed for the duration of a ceremony.  Marks are predetermined and usually indicated by a “T” placed on the marching surface, using either chalk or tape.  1.14.8.  Pin Hand.   The act of returning the hand to the side as if at the position of attention or the position of the hand at the position of attention.  Figure 1.12.  Pin Hand  1.14.9.  Cut Hand.   The position of the hand when at a flare in front of the body, flared and the  thumb  tucked  behind  the  fingers  with  the  forearm  parallel  to  the  ground  or  the  act  of sharply returning the hand to the position of attention from a flared position.   50 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 1.13.  Cut Hand.   1.15.  Drill  Instruction.    All  instruction  will  be  executed  IAW  AFMAN  36-2203,  paragraph 1.5. with the following additions:  1.15.1.  When using the BY THE NUMBERS technique, students will vocalize the number corresponding to the count they have executed.  1.15.2.  IN CADENCE is the method in which the cadence of precision movements with two or  more  counts  are  demonstrated,  practiced,  and  learned—one  count  at  a  time,  while vocalizing each count of the movement.  1.15.3.  This  method  enables  the  student  to  practice  the  cadence  of  a  movement  after  they have  learned  using  the  “BY  THE  NUMBERS”  method.    The  instructor  commands  IN CADENCE before giving commands for the movement.  On the command of execution, the member will execute  all counts of the movement  in  the same manner  as  “WITHOUT THE NUMBERS” but will verbalize the number of each count as it is executed.  1.16.  Voice  Commands.    Informational  commands  listed  in  this  manual  will  be  in  all  capital letters.  All other commands will be in bold print.  Commands of execution will be noted in bold print and all capital letters.  1.16.1.  Honor  guards  will  adhere  to  AFMAN  36-2203  when  giving  commands  with  the following clarification and exceptions:  1.16.2.  When  commanding  a  formation  to  fall  in,  attention  or  halt  the  appropriate preparatory  command  for  that  formation  will  be  given,  i.e.  pallbearers,  cordon,  escort,  etc. NOTE:    The  preparatory  command  of  Escort  will  only  be  used  during  military  funerals  in which a military escort is present (e.g. FHF in Arlington National Cemetery).  1.16.3.  While  marching,  all  movements  will  be  executed  on  the  heel  beat  following  the command of execution, this includes eyes right (left).  1.16.4.  Preparatory  commands  may  be  combined  (multi-part  commands)  to  enable  the formation  to  perform  several  movements  in  succession  using  only  one  command  of execution.    For  example,  while  the  formation  is  at  mark  time  the  commander  calls  Flight, Left, Parade, REST.  The preparatory commands of flight, left and parade tell the formation to  halt,  perform  a  left  face  and  execute  parade  rest.    The  formation  will  perform  all movements  in  the  order  they  are  given  and  the  commander  will  give  the  appropriate command  of  execution  that  coincides  with  the  last  preparatory  command  in  the  sequence.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 51 There  is  no  limit  to  the  number  or  combinations  that  can  be  executed.    Combining preparatory  commands/manuals  promotes  confidence,  esprit  de  corps  and  is  highly recommended to vary the training environment and push members to be the best they can be.  1.16.5.  Commands corresponding to a direction/side, such as columns, flanks, eyes, right/left shoulder etc. will always be called on the foot matching the direction the person will turn, look, or the shoulder they’ll be placing the weapon on.  1.16.6.  The  command  Ready,  FACE  or  Center,  FACE  may  be  used  when  members  are facing  opposite  directions  and  it  is  desired  for  the  members  to  face  the  commander.    The commander  must  position  himself  in  the  location  that  they  require  the  members  to  face.  Members should face in the direction that the command is coming from.  1.16.7.  The command MARCH may be used to command a formation to execute a series of preparatory commands and/or combined commands.  An example would be Flight, Fall Out, MARCH.  The command FALL OUT is a combined command however in this instance the command is being used as a preparatory command while the formation is marching.  1.16.8.  Subdued  commands  are  commands  given  in  a  low  quiet  tone  only  loud  enough  for the individual(s) that are being directed to hear.  1.16.9.  Refer to Attachment 2 for proper inflection and distinctness of commands.  52 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 2 BASIC INSTRUCTION  Section 2A—Basic Unarmed Standing Drill 2.1.  Position of Attention.   The command of execution is ATTENTION and will be preceded by  a  preparatory  command  (i.e.  colors,  pallbearers,  firing  party,  flight,  etc.).    To  come  to  the position of attention, bring the feet together smartly, the heels and balls of feet are together and touching.  Keep the legs straight without stiffening or locking the knees.  The body is erect with hips level, chest lifted, and shoulders square and even.  The chin is parallel to the ground.  Arms hang  straight  down  alongside  the  body,  wrists  are  not  bent,  and  knuckles  are  parallel  to  the ground.  Place middle finger along the seams of the trousers.  The thumbs must not protrude past the index fingers and there will be no visible space between the knuckle of the thumbs and  the hands  (Figure  1.11.).    Hands  are  cupped  with  palms  facing  the  leg.    Head  is  erect,  neck  is vertical with the body, and eyes are facing forward with the line of sight parallel to the ground.  The  weight  of  the  body  rests  equally  on  the  heels  and  balls  of  both  feet,  and  silence  and immobility are required.  Figure 2.1.  Unarmed Attention   2.2.  Rest Positions.   There are six positions of rest for Air Force honor guards.  All positions of rest  are  executed  from  a  halt,  only  from  the  position  of  attention  and  IAW  AFMAN  36-2203 except for the following:  2.2.1.  Parade  Rest.    The  command  is  Parade,  REST.    Upon  the  command  of  execution REST, lift the left foot smartly and move it left six to eight inches apart, in-line and parallel with each other.  Feet point straight forward, legs are straight but not stiff.  2.2.1.1.  As  the  left  foot  moves,  arms  extend  behind  the  body  and  hang  straight  down with  hands  flared  properly  (palms  away  from  the  body  and  hands  flat),  right  hand  over AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 53 the  left  hand  with  middle  finger  tips  overlapping  with  fingers  extended  and  joined, thumbs interlocked.  Figure 2.2.  Unarmed Parade Rest   2.2.2.  Ceremonial  At  Ease.    The  command  is  Ceremonial  At,  EASE.    This  is  a  three-count movement executed from the position of attention.  This movement is only used when the member is unarmed or carrying a side arm and is part of an armed (with rifles) formation.  The  member  will  only  execute  ceremonial  at  ease  if  they  are  given  the  command  to  do  so (e.g.  member  will  never  take  their  own  command  and  perform  this  movement).    The movement  will  only  be  performed  simultaneously  with  members  with  rifles  and  never  as  a solitary member.  2.2.2.1.  (Count  1)  .    Upon  the  command  of  execution  EASE,  lift  the  left  foot  smartly and move it left six to eight inches apart, in-line and parallel with each other.  Feet point straight forward, legs are straight but not stiff.  2.2.2.2.  As the left foot  moves, arms  extend behind  the body  and move to the small of the back to a flared position (palms away from the body and hands flat), right hand over the left hand.  Both hands will “slap” the lower back with an audible sound.  The back of the  right  hand  should  be  in  the  palm  of  the  left  with  thumb  tips  touching  and  fingers parallel to the ground.  54 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.3.  Unarmed Ceremonial At Ease (Count 1)  2.2.2.3.  (Count 2)  . Bring properly flared right hand directly in front and centered on the body.   Figure 2.4.  Unarmed Ceremonial At Ease (Count 2)   2.2.2.4.  (Count 3)  .  Bring properly flared left hand in front of and centered on the body resting it directly on top of the right hand.  Middle fingers will be touching.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 55 Figure 2.5.  Unarmed Ceremonial At Ease (Count 3)   2.2.2.5.  To return to attention.  The command is Honor Guard or Escort (given as two syllables,  i.e.  “Es-CORT”)  ATTENTION.    On  the  preparatory  command  of  Honor Guard (Escort), move to the position of modified parade rest.  2.2.2.6.  (Count 1)  .  Flare both hands and arms approximately four inches to sides at a 45-degree angle from the body.  Figure 2.6.  Returning to Attention from Unarmed Ceremonial At Ease (Count 1)  2.2.2.7.  (Count  2)  .    Return  both  hands  to  the  small  of  the  back  with  an  audible  back slap (Refer to paragraphs 2.2.2.1 and 2.2.2.2. and figure 2.3.).  2.2.2.8.  On the command of ATTENTION, return to the position of attention.   56 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 2.2.3.  Stand At Ease.   The command for this movement is Stand At, EASE.  This is a two-count movement executed from the position of attention.  This movement is used when the positions of parade rest and ceremonial at ease are not appropriate.  Stand at ease is typically used  by  members  with  side  arms  that  are  in  charge  of  formations  with  members  carrying rifles.  2.2.3.1.  (Count  1)  .    Upon  the  command  of  execution  EASE,  lift  the  left  foot  smartly and move it left six to eight inches apart, in-line and parallel with each other.  Feet point straight forward, legs are straight but not stiff.  Figure 2.7.  Stand At Ease (Count 1)   2.2.3.2.  (Count  2)  .    Bring  both  hands  together  in  front  of  and  centered  on  the  body.  The  left  hand  will  rest  directly  on  top  of  the  right  hand  with  middle  fingers  touching (figure  2.5.).    The  left  hand  will  rest  directly  on  top  of  the  right  hand  with  the  middle fingers touching, hands properly flared. NOTE:  If commanding a formation with rifles to perform ceremonial at ease (frequently required by NCOICs of Cordons and NCOICs of firing parties), the commander will execute counts one and two of stand at ease on counts 2 and 3 of the formation.  The commander will stay in cadence with the formation.  2.2.4.  Fall  Out.    The command is  FALL  OUT.  From the position of attention, execute a two-count about face (see 2.3.2.), step off with the left foot, and leave the formation.  Unless told otherwise, remain in the immediate area.   NOTES:    1. When in formation  with a rifle, execute port arms prior to performing an about face. 2. When in a formation with armed and unarmed  personnel,  the  informational  command  of  Weapons  In  Formation  will  be  given prior  to  the  command  of  FALL  OUT.    On  the  command,  members  with  rifles  will  execute port  arms  then  perform  an  about  face.    Members  without  rifles  will  wait  two  counts  then perform an about face in cadence with the armed members of the formation. EXCEPTION:  After grounding arms, while carrying a flag, while at the position carry or on a surface that prevents you from completing an about face then on the command of execution; execute a left face instead.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 57 2.3.  Facing  Movements.    Execute  facing  movements  from  a  halt  and  at  the  position  of attention.  When the command Ready,  FACE is used, members should face in the direction of the command (paragraph 1.13.8.).  2.3.1.  Right (Left) Face.   The command for the movement is Right (Left), FACE.  This is a two-count movement.  2.3.1.1.  (Count 1)  .  From the position of attention, lift the right (left) foot and place it down  90-degrees  to  the  left  (right)  foot  forming  an  "L".    The  corner  of  the  heel  of  the right (left) foot should be against the corner of the heel of the left (right) foot.   The head is  perpendicular  to  the  shoulders  throughout  the  movement  (head  and  shoulders  will follow the foot that is turning).  The rest of the body remains at the position of attention at a 45-degree angle.  Figure 2.8.  Unarmed Right Face (Count 1)   2.3.1.2.  (Count  2)  .  Distribute the weight  of the body to  the right  (left) foot.   Lift the left (right) foot and, with snap, bring it alongside the right (left) foot. Simultaneously the body will finish  90-degrees from  the original position.   The rest  of the body remains at the position of attention (figure 2.1.).  2.3.2.  Two-count About Face.   The command for the movement is About, FACE.  This is a two-count movement executed from the position of attention.  2.3.2.1.  (Count  1)  .  Upon  the  command  of  execution  FACE,  lift  the  right  foot  just enough to clear the ground and place it perpendicular to and behind the left foot forming a  backwards  "T"  with  both  feet,  arms  remain  pinned  to  the  side.  The  head  is perpendicular to the shoulders throughout the movement (Head and shoulders will follow the foot that is turning).  The position of the left foot is not changed.  Most of the weight of the body is resting on the ball of the right foot.  58 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.9.  Unarmed Two-count About Face (Count 1)   2.3.2.2.  (Count 2)  .  Pivot to the right on the ball of the right foot while lifting the left foot just enough to clear the ground to meet the right, bringing feet together smartly and resuming the position of attention 180-degrees from starting position.  Keep arms pinned to the side for the entire movement (figure 2.1.).  2.3.3.  Three-count About Face.   There is no command for this movement.  This movement is only performed while moving as a solitary member from the position of attention, if  you cannot  perform  a  two-count  about  face  (i.e.  grass,  carpet),  or  if  the  sequence  or  ceremony requires  it  (i.e.  certain  pallbearer  and  joint  service  movements).    This  is  a  three-count movement  executed  from  the  position  of  attention.    NOTE:    For  training  purposes  and  as mission dictates, THREE COUNT will be given as an informational command, followed by About, FACE.  2.3.3.1.  (Count 1)  .  Lift the left foot just enough to clear the ground and place it in front (perpendicular) of the right foot forming a "T" with both feet, bend the knees slightly.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 59 Figure 2.10.  Unarmed Three-count About Face (Count 1)   2.3.3.2.  (Count  2)  .  The  position  of  the  left  foot  is  not  changed;  lift  the  right  foot  just high  enough  to  clear  the  ground  and  pivot  180-degrees,  bring  the  corners  of  the  heels together to form a 90-degree angle (an "L") (figure 2.8.).  2.3.3.3.  (Count  3)  .  Bring the left foot smartly to the right foot, resuming the position of  attention.    Keep  the  arms  pinned  at  the  side  for  the  entire  movement.      The  head  is perpendicular to the shoulders throughout the movement (Head and shoulders will follow the foot that is turning) (figure 2.1.).  2.4.  Present Arms and Order Arms (Hand Salute).    This movement is usually completed at the individuals own cadence, which is typically a sharp, one-count movement.  The exception to this  is  when  the  member  is  performing  the  movement  within  a  formation  using  rifles.    In  this scenario, both  present  and order arms will be completed as three-count  movements.   They will also be completed as three-count movements as mission dictates, for example upon completion of a flag fold and handing off the flag during a ceremony.  In addition AFI 34-2101, AFPAM 34-1202 and AFMAN 36-2203 all provide guidance on when to render the hand salute.  To clarify procedures outlined in AFMAN 36-2203, as a rule of thumb, Airmen will salute anytime they are transferring/relieving/giving command of a formation to another Airman.  2.4.1.  The command is Present, ARMS.  Upon the command of execution ARMS, from the position of attention, raise the right  hand up the  centerline of the body, start uncupping the hand  and  extending  the  fingers  and  thumb  at  waist  level.    Continue  to  raise  the  right  hand until the bicep is parallel with the ground and slightly forward of the body. The line between the middle finger and elbow should be straight (do not bend your wrist or cup your hand) and the palm is slightly tilted toward the face.  Touch the middle finger to the right front corner of  the  brim  of  the  hat,  the  outer  right  point  of  the  eyebrow,  or  the  right  outer  point  on  the eyeglasses,  depending  on  what  is  worn.    Fingers  are  extended  and  joined,  thumb  along  the forefinger. Do not tuck thumb.  NOTE: When wearing the ceremonial belt (“bloused”), the bicep  will  be  at  a  45-degree  angle  as  opposed  to  being  parallel  to  prevent  wearers  blouse from rising.  60 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.11.  Hand Salute  2.4.1.1.  To return to the position of attention, the command is Order, ARMS.  Upon the command of execution ARMS, simply retrace your steps backward from the hand salute, re-cupping  your  hand  at  waist  level.    During  present  arms,  silence  and  immobility  are required.   Section 2B—Basic Unarmed Marching Drill. 2.5.  Forward March.   The command is Forward, MARCH.  Upon the command of execution MARCH, step off with the left foot sliding your heel for the first step.  Pick up coordinated arm swing,  six  inches  to  the  front  and  three  inches  to  the  rear.    Ensure  that  wrist  remains  straight during arm swing.  The arm should swing straight forward and straight back.  To ensure that the hands  do  not  cross  in  front  of  or  behind  the  body,  all  four  fingers  should  graze  past  the  thigh (slightly contacting) during both the forward and rear swing.  When marching, place one foot in front of the other, in a straight line versus toes pointing inward or outward.  To assist with this technique,  imagine  you  are  walking  on  a  balance  beam  or  tight  rope.    While  marching,  the outside  of  the  members  heel  should  strike  the  ground  first  and  members  will  “roll”  their  feet, following all the way through the front, inside of the large toe, enabling the entire foot to come in contact with the marching surface.  2.5.1.  Cadence  should  not  be  called.    If  necessary,  the  commands  LEFT,  RIGHT,  LEFT will  be  given  in  order  to  bring  the  formation  back  in  cadence  with  each  other.    Once  the formation is in step, the commander will cease calling cadence.  2.5.2.  The command of HALT is always given on the left foot.  2.6.  Mark Time March.   The purpose of this movement is to march in place.  This movement is executed from the position of attention and quick time.  2.6.1.  The command for this movement is Mark,  Time,  MARCH.  Upon the command of execution lift the left leg and begin marching in place, lifting each foot letting your toes hang freely. Lift your feet so your toes are pointed downward and are approximately 4-6 inches off AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 61 the  ground.    Keep  the  arms  suspended  at  your  side.    The  rest  of  the  body  remains  at  the position of attention.  2.6.2.  From  a  march,  the  command  is  Mark,  TIME.    The  preparatory  command  of  Mark will  be  called  on  the  left  foot  and  the  command  or  execution,  TIME,  will  be  given  on  the right.

Members will pick up a mark time automatically when they have reached their mark.  2.7.  Honor  Guard  Flanking  Movement. flight commander/sergeant,  first  sergeant  or  spare  and  required  to  take  a  new  position  in  the  flight, members  will  perform  an  honor  guard  style  flanking  movement  in  order  to  face  90-degrees during  the  march  to  new  position.    These  flanking  movements  may  also  be  utilized  by  the Commander of Troops (COT) as required to position and halt a formation.    When  performing  as  a  guide, 2.7.1.  Right  (Left)  Flank.    There  is  no  command  for  this  movement,  unless  stated otherwise in this manual.  2.7.2.  Suspend arm swing, place the toe of the trailing foot (right foot if turning left, left foot if turning right) into the arc of the planted foot, creating a letter “T”, and simultaneously turn your body.  Shift the weight from  your planted foot to the trailing toe then rock back while 62 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 rotating  the  toe  of  the  planted  foot  in  the  direction  of  the  flank,  continue  coordinated  arm swing once forward motion has resumed.  Figure 2.13.  Right (Left) Flank  Section 2C—Drill of the Flight, Squadron, Group and Wing.  2.8.  Reference.    Please  refer  to  AFMAN  36-2203,  Drill  and  Ceremonies,  for  guidance  on Flight, Squadron, Group and Wing drills and formations.  2.8.1.  Honor guards must adhere to AFMAN 36-2203, paragraph 1.5.1.  2.9.  Sizing  the  Flight.    When flight members are instructed to move forward if they are taller (shorter) than the Airmen in front of them, they will do so in the following manner:  2.9.1.  If you are taller and need to replace the Airmen in front of you.  Using the right hand, tap the member in front on their right shoulder, and then resume the position of attention.  2.9.1.1.  Take one step forward and 45-degrees to the right using the right foot bring feet together at the position of attention.  2.9.1.2.  Take another step forward and 45-degrees to the left using the left foot bring feet together at the position of attention.  2.9.2.  If you are shorter and were tapped on the shoulder. Take one step backwards at a 45-degree angle to the left using the left foot, bring fee together at the position of attention.  2.9.2.1.  Take  another  step  backwards  at  a  45-degree  angle  to  the  right  using  the  right foot; bring feet together at the position of attention.  2.10.  Aligning  the  Flight.    Honor  guards  will  use  the  following  additional  techniques  and procedures to dress their flights.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 63 2.10.1.  Dress  Center  Dress.    The  command  is  Dress  Center,  DRESS  and  Ready, FRONT.  On the command DRESS, everyone will look down at their mark and reposition so that their toes are in line with and splitting the “T.”  2.10.2.  Once all members are positioned on their marks, the command Ready, FRONT will be given.  On the command of execution all members will look up, returning to the position of  attention.  NOTE:    While  repositioning,  members  will  deliberately  reposition,  avoiding excessive, unnecessary movements and refrain from “heel clicks.”  2.11.  Alignment  Procedures.    All requirements outlined in AFMAN 36-2203 will be adhered to  as  mission  and  manning  dictates.    The  following  additional  procedures  are  required  by  Air Force honor guards.  2.11.1.  After  aligning  the  last  element,  the  flight  commander/sergeant  will  perform  a  right (left) face.  2.12.  Guide,  Flight  Commander/Sergeant  and  First  Sergeant  Repositioning.   When repositioning, these positions will always step off with the foot closest to the formation in order to execute honor guard flanking movements correctly.  Individuals can also be taught to always step  off  with  the  foot  correlating  to  the  direction  that  was  commanded.    For  example,  if  the command  for  right  face  is  given,  then  the  individual  will  step  off  with  the  right  foot  and  vice versa.    EXCEPTION:    When  the  command  Guide,  LEFT  (RIGHT)  is  given  both  guide  and flight commanders/sergeants will step off with the left foot.  2.12.1.  Flight  commanders/sergeants  and  guides  will  all  face  the  appropriate  direction simultaneously.  This is accomplished by the “trailing” member providing a loud and distinct heel click upon halting.  Both members will face, in cadence, on the heel click.  In occasions where a heel click is not appropriate, in a low tone give the command Ready, FACE.  2.12.2.  Flight  Sergeants  and  First  Sergeants,  commonly  but  incorrectly  referred  to  as “Spares” may be positioned 3-paces behind  and centered on the flight  when necessary, e.g. formations in Arlington National Cemetery.  Section 2D—Basic Armed Standing Drill 2.13.  General.    This section contains the basic rifle drill movements used by honors guards in Air Force formations.  Individuals must master the basic standing and marching drill movements outlined in sections 2A through 2C prior to learning to drill with a weapon.  2.13.1.  All movements described in this section are performed using the M14 rifle. However honor  guards  can  utilize  the  Springfield  1903,  M1  Garand,  M4  or  M16  as  mission  and location dictates.  All the same guidance applies and hand and weapon placement will be in the same relative position for each rifle.  64 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 2.14.  M14 Rifle Nomenclature   2.14.

Introduction.   This  chapter  provides  guidance  on  intermediate  weapons  handling techniques.    Individuals  must  master  the  movements  in  Chapter  2  prior  to  attempting  or progressing to the intermediate level of drill.  This level of drill contains many movements and techniques  that  have  gone  beyond  their  tactical  purpose  and  can  be  utilized  during  exhibitions and drill demonstrations.  3.1.1.  All movements described in this section are performed using the M14 rifle. However honor  guards  can  utilize  the  Springfield  1903,  M1  Garand,  M4  or  M16  as  mission  and location dictates.  The M4 or M16 are only used in forward operating/deployed environments and  only  while  wearing  a  utility  uniform.    All  the  same  guidance  applies,  and  hand  and weapon placement will be in the same relative position for each rifle.  3.1.2.  The  manuals  described  in  this  chapter  are  designed  to  give  the  honor  guardsman  a thorough understanding of Air Force armed drill and act as a stepping stone to progress into more  advanced  sequences  and  combinations.    This  is  only  a  small  glimpse  into  the possibilities  that  exist  at  this  level  of  drill  proficiency.    Every  movement  detailed  in  this chapter can be executed from any position, in any combination of movements.  3.1.3.  Members  are  encouraged  to  develop  new  techniques  and  manuals  so  long  as  they adhere  to  the  principals  and  guidelines  described  in  this  chapter.    At  this  level  of  drill proficiency, at least one hand will be in control of the weapon at all times.  Individuals will never throw or allow the weapon to leave both hands.  Some advanced manuals meet these criteria  and  can be performed by intermediate level  marching units;  some examples are the Nine Taps firing sequence, Inspection Arms, Neck Roll and the Back Stretch.  3.2.  Carry Arms [From Order].   The command for this movement is Carry, ARMS.  This is a  three  count  movement  performed  from  the  position  of  order.    This  position  is  usually  used during  pre-ceremony  positioning  or  training  and  in  most  situations  is  the  preferred  method  for carrying the weapon.  3.2.1.  When a member is carrying a rifle and placed in command of a flight they will assume the position of carry arms prior to giving any commands.  3.2.2.  Carry arms is used in the same manner as sling arms and replaces the sling arms for Air Force honor guards.  3.2.3.  (Count 1)  .  On the command of execution, lift the weapon up in-line with the right shoulder along forearm and at the same time grip the weapon with the left hand on the sling with the middle finger at the first groove.  3.2.4.  (Count 1)  .  The weapon is parallel to the body, right arm is at a 45-degree angle and the left forearm is parallel to the ground.  110 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 3.1.  Carry Arms [From Order] (Count 1)   3.2.5.  (Count 2)  .  Grip the small of the stock with the right hand while placing the weapon along the right arm.  Figure 3.2.  Carry Arms [From Order] (Count 2)   3.2.6.  (Count 3)  .  Sharply move the left hand to the position of attention with the knuckles parallel to the ground. NOTE:  In order to execute a salute while at carry bring the flared left hand,  with  palm  facing  the  ground  across  and  in  front  of  the  abdomen.    Left  arm  will  be parallel to the ground and four inches away from the body.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 111 Figure 3.3.  Carry Arms [From Order] (Count 3)   3.3.  Order  Arms  [From  Carry].    The  command  is  Order,  ARMS.    This  is  a  four  count movement from the position of carry.  3.3.1.  (Count 1)  .  Bring the left hand across the body so that the forearm is parallel to the ground.  At the same time, let the weapon fall into the pam of the hand at a 45-degree angle.  The  weapon  should  stay  in-line  with  the  right  shoulder;  left  thumb  is  adjoined  with  the forefinger with the middle finger at the first groove.  Figure 3.4.

The  command  for  this  manual  is  Manual,  ARMS.    This  is  a  27-count  manual  and  is  only  performed  from  the  position  of  order.    The  sequence  for  this manual is right shoulder, left shoulder, secure arms, left shoulder, right shoulder and order.  3.7.1.1.  This manual and its purpose can trace its origins to the revolutionary war when commanding officers traditionally established control over his command by giving them the manual of arms or some facings.  3.7.1.2.  The Army equivalent is 15-count Manual, ARMS and any experienced soldier should  be  able  to  complete  the  manual.    The  15  counts  contain  all  the  basic  drill movements necessary for one to be a functioning member of a formation.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 115 3.7.1.3.  Both  of  these  manuals  can  be  linked  to  the  original  15  one  second  movements needed for an early American soldier to load and fire a musket.  3.7.1.4.  This  history  and  heritage  live  on  today  when  NCOs  use  this  manual  to demonstrate  the  troops  state  of  readiness  during  a  ceremony  in  which  command  of  the flight will be given to an Officer (i.e. Tattoo ceremonies).  3.7.1.5.

Section 3B—Intermediate Marching Drill 3.8.  Additional  Information.    Marching  armed  drill  is  designed,  in  most  cases,  so  the  first count  of  each  manual  is  different  for  each  movement.    One  advantage  in  doing  this  is  that  it allows the individual to know what movement to perform even if they cannot hear the command.  128 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 3.8.1.  Beasts (see paragraph 1.13.1.) are used throughout rifle drill to establish cadence and lock on with other members of the formation.  3.8.2.  When  it  is  desired  of  the  flight  to  perform  movements  by  the  ripple  use  the informational  command  BY  THE  RIPPLE  followed  by  the  direction  of  the  rippled movement.  The informational commands indicating the direction of the ripple are LEFT TO RIGHT,  RIGHT  TO  LEFT,  FRONT  TO  REAR  or  REAR  TO  FRONT.    These  commands may  also  be  combined  to  enable  the  flight  to  ripple  the  movements  in  two  directions simultaneously,  moving  the  ripple  along  at  a  diagonal.  NOTE:    During  ceremonies, specifically  street  parades,  keep  informational  and  multi-part  preparatory  commands  to  a minimum.   This  allows  the  focus  to  stay  on  the  troops  rather  than  the  flight commander/sergeant.    Too  many  commands,  or  wordy  informational/multi-part  commands distracts from the focal point of the parade.  3.9.  Trail  Arms  (From  Port).

The command for this manual is Connie’s Manual, ARMS and it is called on the left foot from the position of port while marching at quick time.  3.13.5.1.  The procedures for Connie’s manual are identical to the procedures outlined in paragraph 3.7.3. NOTE:  This manual can be modified and performed as an eight count movement  depending  on  the  experience  level  and  needs  of  the  unit.    Typically,  this  is accomplished  by  taking  a  dead  step  after  completing  count  three  and  before  executing count four.  3.14.  Combining Manuals.   As stated previously in this manual the combination of movements that can be combined into complex manuals and sequences is limited only by one’s imagination.  Nearly  every  movement  can  be  “connected”  to  another  by  giving  multi-part  commands.    The three  examples  below  are  the  first  combined  manuals  that  an  honor  guard  should  learn.    If  an individual masters the techniques used in these manuals then they can combine and perform any combination of movements.  3.14.1.  Right  Shoulder  Port  Arms  [From  Port].    The  command  for  this  movement  is Right  Shoulder,  Port,  ARMS  and  it  is  called  on  the  right  foot  from  the  position  of  port while marching at quick time.  3.14.1.1.

General.    This  chapter  provides  guidance  on  advanced  weapons  handling  techniques.  Individuals  must  master  the  movements  in  Chapter  2  and  Chapter  3  prior  to  attempting  or progressing to the advanced level of drill  4.1.1.  All movements described in this section are performed using the M1 rifle.  At no time will any of these movements be performed using any other rifle.  4.1.2.  The  manuals  described  in  this  chapter  represent  a  higher  level  of  drill  proficiency.  These  manuals  are  for  demonstration  and  exhibition  purposes  only.    At  this  level  of  drill, members  will  execute  the  majority  of  sequences  and  manuals  without  the  use  of  verbal commands.  Figure 4.1.  M1 Garand Rifle Nomenclature  4.2.  Definitions.  4.2.1.  Cadence:   All weapons drills are performed to the cadence of the team.  4.2.2.  Balance  Points.    The  M1  has  two  primary  balance  points.    The  first  being  at  the band, and the second at  the small of the stock (figure 4.1.).  The key to  effective drill  is  to utilize these balance points while performing the movements to manipulate the weapon.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 139 4.2.3.  Looking at or through the Weapon.    While performing, individuals should always remain  at  the  position  of  attention  with  the  head  and  eyes  straight  forward.    The  only exception to this is when the weapon is above the shoulder or head.  In all other cases, unless specified otherwise, members will look through the weapon while executing the movements.  4.2.4.  Standing  Movements.    Safety takes priority and a good rule of thumb is to provide extra precautions for movements that are performed in the horizontal position.  4.2.5.  Tapping.   Any time it is required to tap the weapon, do so with just enough effort to ensure the weapon moves to the next count.  4.3.  Nine Taps (Firing Sequence).  4.3.1.  Nine Taps (Firing Sequence).

General.   Tradition dictates that Officers will carry sabers and Noncommissioned Officers (NCO) will carry swords.  This requirement has been outlined in every U.S. drill manual going back to the “Blue Book.”  Both weapons are a symbol of rank.  5.1.1.  All  sabers  and  swords  are  considered  weapons.    Airmen  are  considered  to  be  under arms  when  wearing  the  scabbard  with  saber  or  sword  whether  sheathed  or  unsheathed.    In most cases the scabbard, along with headgear, will always be worn when armed with a saber or  sword.    However  there  will  be  instances/situations  that  call  for  different  protocol.  Examples are:  5.1.1.1.  Do not wear headgear or the scabbard when carrying the Air Force or MAJCOM Sword during an Order of the Sword ceremony.  5.1.1.2.  Do  not  wear  headgear  or  the  scabbard  when  carrying/using  a  sword  during  the cake cutting ceremony at an Air Force Ball.  5.1.1.3.  During  saber  or  sword  arch  ceremonies  the  team  members  will  not  wear  the ceremonial belt and scabbard.  5.1.1.4.  Sabers  and  swords  can  be  worn  inside  a  place  of  worship  however  they  will never be unsheathed and headgear will not be worn.  5.2.  Terms, Wear and Use.  5.2.1.  Saber.   A cavalry sword with a slightly curved blade and a hand guard.  The blade of a  cavalry  sword  must  be  curved  in  order  to  remove  the  blade  from  the  scabbard  while  on horseback.  Since officers in early American history were required to ride on horseback, their swords  became  known  only  as  sabers.    The  Air  Force  inherited  this  history  from  the  U.S. Army and carries on many of its traditions.  5.2.1.1.  Air Force personnel will refer to any sword with a curved blade as a saber.  5.2.1.2.  Officers will wear the saber while participating in ceremonies with troops under arms, or as directed.  5.2.1.3.  The  scabbard  is  carried  on  the  left  side  of  the  body  attached  to  the  belt  by  the scabbard chain and leather saber guard with the saber’s hand guard to the rear.  5.2.2.  Sword.   Any weapon with a long, straight blade will be referred to as a sword.  5.2.2.1.  Only NCOs and Air Force Academy Cadets will carry swords.  5.2.2.2.  Noncommissioned  Officers  will  wear in ceremonies  as  flight  sergeants,  first  sergeants,  the  COT  with  troops  under  arms,  or  as directed.  the  sword  while  participating 5.2.2.3.  It is carried on the left side of the body attached using the leather frog with the guard to the front.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 143 Figure 5.1.  Saber and Sword Nomenclature  Figure 5.2.  Proper Wear of the Saber and Sword with Scabbards   Section 5B—Saber and Sword Standing Drill 5.3.  Positions of Attention.   5.3.1.  Attention.    This is the position before the command Draw, SABER (SWORD) and after the command Return, SABER (SWORD).  The position is identical to the procedures outlined in paragraph 2.1.  5.3.2.  Carry  Saber  (Sword).    At  this  position  the  officer/NCO  is  at  the  position  of attention.  The saber (sword) is held in the right hand; the wrist is as straight as possible with the thumb along the seam of the trousers.  The point of the blade rests inside the point of the 144 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 shoulder and not along the arm.  The tip of the saber (sword) will not extend past the top of the  ear  and  will  be  no  lower  than  the  lowest  point  of  the  ear  orifice.    The  optimal  saber (sword) length places the tip of the blade directly in the middle of the ear.  The saber (sword) is held in this position by the thumb and forefinger grasping the grip and it is steadied with the second finger behind the grip.  The remaining fingers are joined in a natural curl behind the end of the hilt as if holding a pen or pencil.  Figure 5.3.  Carry Saber (Sword)  5.3.2.1.  The carry saber (sword) position is assumed under the following situations:   5.3.2.2.  To give commands.  5.3.2.3.  To change positions.  5.3.2.4.  By officers when officially addressing (or when officially addressed by) another officer, if the saber is drawn.  5.3.2.5.  By NCOs when officially addressing an airman, or when officially addressed by an officer, if the sword is drawn.  5.3.2.6.  Before returning the saber (sword) to the scabbard.  5.3.2.7.  At  the  preparatory  command  for  (and  while  marching  at)  quick  time  and  any preparatory command directing the Officer/NCO to face or march.  EXAMPLE:  On the preparatory  command  of  Forward,  MARCH,  return  saber  (sword)  to  carry  from  order on the ‘W’ of “For-Ward.”  5.3.3.  Position of Order.   This position refers to the position of attention when serving in a staff or flight sergeant position.  5.3.3.1.  At  the  position  of  order  the  saber  (sword)  is  held  in  the  right  hand  with  the thumb at the seam of the trousers and the tip of the blade six inches above the marching surface.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 145 5.3.3.2.  The  saber  (sword)  is  straight  and  not  at  an  angle  inward  or  outward  in relationship to the body.  5.3.3.3.  The rest of the body is at the position of attention (paragraph 2.1.).  Figure 5.4.  Position of Order  5.4.  Positions of Rest.   5.4.1.  Parade  Rest.    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Parade,  REST.    This  is  a  one count movement executed from the position of attention.  5.4.1.1.  At the command of execution, the left foot is moved about 6 to 8 inches to the left  (of  the  right  foot),  and  the  left  hand  is  placed  in  the  small  of  the  back,  fingers extended and joined, palm to the rear.  5.4.1.2.  If at the position of carry, then let the saber (sword) fall to the order position.  5.4.1.3.  If at the position of order, then the saber (sword) will not move.  146 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 5.5.  Parade Rest  5.4.1.4.  To return to the position of attention:   5.4.1.5.  On  the  command  of  ATTENTION,  the  left  hand  and  foot  are  returned  to  the position of attention.  5.4.2.  Ceremonial  At  Ease.    The command for this movement is  Ceremonial  At,  EASE.  This is a three count movement starting from the position of attention.  5.4.2.1.  (Count 1)  .  Execute parade rest (paragraph 5.4.1. and figure 5.5.).  5.4.2.2.  (Count 2)  .  Move the saber (sword) across the body, at waist level, directly in front and centered on the body.  The tip of the saber (sword) is directly between and on-line  with  the  left  and  the  right  foot.    The  tip  of  the  sword  is  about  1-2  inches  from  the marching surface.  The right thumb closest to the body; remaining fingers extended and joined farthest from the body.  The left hand remains in the small of the back.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 147 Figure 5.6.  Ceremonial At Ease Count 2   5.4.2.3.  (Count 3)  .  Reposition the left hand to meet the right hand in front of the body.  Left hand (fingers extended and joined) lies on top of right hand; thumb wraps around the wrist with middle figure at the wrist bone.  5.4.2.4.  Upon completion of the third count, slowly lower the saber (sword) to gently rest on the marching surface.  Figure 5.7.  Ceremonial At Ease (Count 3)  5.4.2.5.  To return to the position of attention:   5.4.2.6.  The command is Honor Guard, ATTENTION or Escort, ATTENTION.  This is  a  three  count  movement.    On  the  preparatory  command  of  Honor  Guard  (Escort), move to the position of parade rest.  148 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 5.4.2.7.  (Count  1)  .    The  grip  of  the  saber  (sword)  is  grasped  securely  with  the  right hand.  The left hand and the saber (sword) remain in position.  Figure 5.8.  Honor Guard or Escort (Count 1)   5.4.2.8.  (Count 2)  .  Assume the position of parade rest (figure 5.5.).  5.4.2.9.  (Count  3)  .    On  the  command  of  ATTENTION,  the  left  hand  and  foot  are returned to the position of attention (figure 5.4.).  5.4.2.10.  If returning to carry, simultaneously return the saber (sword) to the position of carry  (figure  5.3.).  NOTE:    If  performing  as  COT  or  a  solitary  member  in  charge  of  a formation, then the individual will return to the position of carry after completing count 3,  making  this  a  four  count  movement.    Whenever  an  individual  is  returning  to  the position of attention with the saber (sword) at carry, at the same time as other members in a formation, then they will snap to attention and return to carry in the same count.  5.4.2.11.  If returning to order, the saber (sword) does not move after count 2.  5.5.  Present Arms/Order Arms.  5.5.1.  Present Arms.   The command is Present, ARMS.  5.5.1.1.  On the “S” of Present bring the saber (sword) up (at a rate of two counts) so that the bottom of the grip is approximately four inches from the chin.  The saber (sword) will rotate so that the guard is to the left.  5.5.1.2.  The  saber  (sword)  will  be  at  a  45-degree  angle  (or  six  inches  from  the  vertical position).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 149 Figure 5.9.  Present Arms (“S”)  5.5.1.3.  On the command ARMS, the right hand is lowered (at the rate of three counts) with  the  flat  of  the  blade  upward,  and  the  tip  of  the  saber  (sword)  six  inches  from  the marching surface.  The thumb will “on top” and in-line with the blade.   Figure 5.10.  Present Arms (“ARMS”)   5.5.2.  Order  Arms.    The  command  is  Order,  ARMS.

On the command of execution  SABER  (SWORD), the saber  (sword) is  pulled out  of  the  scabbard  in  a  two-count  movement  and  held  in  the  position  of  carry  saber (sword).  5.6.1.3.  (Count  1)  .    Draw  the  saber  (sword)  smartly,  raising  the  right  arm  to  its  full extent, directly to  the front  at  an angle of about  45-degrees, the sword in  a straight  line with the arm, guard is facing away from the body; pin the left hand (figure 5.13).  Figure 5.13.  Draw Saber (Sword) (Count 1)   5.6.1.4.  (Count 2)  .  Bring the sword to the position of carry by bringing the right hand straight down with the thumb on the seam of the trousers with the inner blade-edge riding in a vertical position along the forward tip of the right shoulder (figure 5.3.).  5.6.2.  Return  Saber  (Sword).    The  command  is  Officers  (Noncommissioned  officers), Return,  SABER  (SWORD).  This is a three count movement starting from the position of 152 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 carry.  If at the position of order, member will move to the carry position on the preparatory command of Officers  (Noncommissioned  officers).  The saber (sword) will be returned to the scabbard when inspecting troops and may be returned when at ease, rest, route step or at ease march.  5.6.2.1.  On the preparatory command  Return the saber (sword) is brought to a vertical position.  The forearm (wrist) is held parallel to  the marching surface about four inches from the body; the guard is pointed to the left.  Figure 5.14.  Return Saber (Sword) (“Return”)   5.6.3.  On  the  command  SABER  (SWORD),  three  actions  take  place  simultaneously:  the saber  (sword)  is  pivoted  downward  toward  the  guard,  at  the  same  time  grasp  the  scabbard with  the  left  hand  just  above  the  upper  brass  ring  mounting.    Tilt  it  forward  and  turn  it clockwise  180-degrees.    The  scabbard  should  form  a  45-degree  angle  with  the  ground,  and the saber (sword) bearer turns his head to the left and looks down to observe the mouthpiece of  the  scabbard  (the  shoulders  remain  squared  to  the  front  and  level).    As  smoothly  and  as quick as possible, the saber (sword) is inserted into the scabbard and stopped so that about 12 inches of the blade is showing; the right forearm (wrist) is horizontal to the marching surface and four inches from the body.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 153 Figure 5.15.

On  the  command  CUT  thrust  the saber  (sword)  smartly  into  the  scabbard;  Officers  will  rotate  the  scabbard  so  the  tip  is forward, and snap to attention (figure 2.1.).   Section 5C—Saber and Sword Marching Drill 154 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 5.7.  General.   Individuals marching with a saber (sword) will never suspend arm swing, except when picking up a mark time or if stated in this manual.  5.8.  Port  Arms.    Is  executed  on  the  command  Double  Time,  MARCH.    The  position  is assumed only from the position of carry.  5.8.1.  On the command Double Time, swing the right arm naturally across and four inches in  front  of  the  body  while  canting  the  saber  (sword)  45-degrees  from  the  vertical  position with the guard facing to the left.  5.8.2.  Grasp the scabbard with the left hand.  Figure 5.17.  Port Arms  5.9.  Eyes Right (Left)/Ready Front.   5.9.1.  Eyes Right (Left).   The command is Ready, Eyes, RIGHT (LEFT).  5.9.1.1.  On  the  right  (left)  foot;  the  command  Ready  is  given  and  no  action  is  taken.

On  the  very  next  step,  turn  the  head  sharply  to  the  right  (left)  at  a  45-degree angle, and the saber (sword) is brought downward, six inches from the marching surface, completing present arms.  5.9.1.6.  Resume  coordinated  arm  swing  upon  completion  of  the  movement.    The  right arm  is  swung  naturally,  flexing  the  wrist  to  keep  the  tip  of  the  blade  level  (about  six inches)  above  the  marching  surface.    This  requires  extending  the  wrist  on  the  forward movement and elevating the wrist on the rearward movement.  Figure 5.19.  Eyes Right (“RIGHT”)  5.9.2.  Ready Front.

The  guidon  bearer  during  ceremonies  with  honor  guard  participation  is responsible for assisting and ensuring the correct execution of ceremonial sequences by the COT.  The  guidon  bearer  must  have  a  thorough  and  complete  knowledge  of  the  ceremony  being performed.  6.2.  Positioning.   The guidon bearer is positioned one pace to the left and one pace to the rear of the COT.  Take the position one pace to the rear and one pace to the left of the COT.  When marching,  adjust  flanking  movements  to  maintain  this  position.    Left  Flank,  MARCH  is followed  by  two-count  Mark,  TIME  and  the  Right  Flank,  MARCH  is  a  two-step  half-right flank  followed  by  another  half-right,  all  movements  are  generally  given  by  the  COT,  however there  are  ceremonies  that  call  for  pre-determined,  synchronous  movements  and  for  the  guidon bearer to be temporarily out of the proper position.  6.2.1.  Facing commands are given without direction as the COT (facing the guidon bearer) executes  an  opposite  facing  movement.    Be  mindful  of  the  direction  of  travel  when  the command Guidon, Ready, FACE is given.  During short-distance carries, the guidon bearer may not be afforded the formal port or right shoulder position.  In this case, discreetly lift the staff enough to clear the ground and execute the facing/marching movement.  6.2.2.  Again, during ceremonies, when marching with the COT, the guidon bearer executes order  arms  after  halting  in  conjunction  with  the  COT’s  movements.    For  example,  execute count one of order arms automatically upon halting and execute count two on the third count of the COT’s three-count About Face.  6.3.  Automatic Sequences.   As outlined in this chapter, the guidon bearer is “linked” with the color team and the COT during ceremonies.  This means there are areas in the guidon manuals that  are  executed  or  finished  in  cadence  with  either  the  COT  or  the  color  team.  This  general guideline  applies  when  working  solely  with  the  COT,  movements  are  executed/finished  with COT’s  movements  and  when  the  color  team  is  present,  movements  are  executed/finished  with the color team.  6.4.  Cadence.    The  guidon  bearer  will  execute  all  movements  in  cadence  with  the  formation, color team and COT.  6.5.  Uniform  Requirements.    The  guidon  bearer  will  not  wear  the  ceremonial  belt.    The chinstrap  will  only  be  worn  in  the  down  position  when  required.    Refer  to  paragraph  16.7.  for proper wear of the ceremonial hat and chinstrap.   The left glove should not be silicone.  Section 6B—Guidon Standing Drill 6.6.  Attention  (Order).    The flagstaff will be held  in  the right hand, palm on the front  of the staff, fingers and thumb grasping the staff tightly.  The right index finger is extended down the centerline  of  the  staff.    The  right  arm  is  fully  extended  with  the  right  thumb  pinned  along  the 158 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 seam of the trousers.  The pike of the staff is grounded approximately two inches from the side of the foot or so the staff is perpendicular to the ground.  Figure 6.1.  Attention   6.7.  Parade  Rest.    The command is  Parade,  REST.  This is a two-count movement executed from the position of order.  6.7.1.  (Count 1)  .  On the preparatory command of Parade, release the right hand from the staff and re-grip the staff directly above the right shoulder.  Figure 6.2.  Parade Rest (Count 1)   6.7.2.  (Count 2)  .  On the command of execution, slap the left hand sharply in the small of the back, palm out,  fingers joined  and  extended.  Simultaneously  and briskly move the left foot six to eight inches to the left, extending the guidon forward to a 45-degree angle keeping the pike in the same position with the right arm fully extended and parallel to ground.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 159 Figure 6.3.  Parade Rest (Count 2)    6.8.  Ceremonial  At  Ease.    The  command  is  Ceremonial  At,  EASE.    This  is  a  four-count movement executed from the position of order.  6.8.1.  (Count  1)  .

Right Shoulder Arms [From Order].    This is a four-count movement used to carry the Guidon.  It is the same movement as Port Arms (from attention) except  that it is performed on the  command  Right  Shoulder,  ARMS  and  the  guidon  bearer  will  stop  at  count  three.    Count four will be executed on the command Colors, Ready, CUT. (Figure 6.7., 6.8., 6.9., 6.10.)  164 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 6.11.  Order Arms [From Port and Right Shoulder].    This is a one count movement used to return to the position of attention.  6.11.1.  On  command  of  execution,  drop  the  staff  to  the  ground  through  the  right  hand allowing pike to hit no more than once.  6.11.2.  Simultaneously  flare  the  left  hand  in  front  of  the  flag,  fingers  fully  extended  and joined, thumb tucked behind the fingers.  Hand and forearm are parallel to the ground, across the  abdomen,  and  approximately  four  inches  (one  fist  distance)  from  the body.    This  is the Ready Cut position.  Figure 6.11.  Order Arms [From Port and Right Shoulder]   6.11.3.  On the command of Colors,  Ready,  CUT, sharply bring the left forearm to the left side, parallel to the ground, elbow pulled straight back and touching the torso, and hand in a fist as if at the position of attention (Count One).  Then, sharply bring down to the position of attention.  (Count 2) (Figure 6.1.).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 165 Figure 6.12.  Colors, Ready, Cut [Count 1]  6.12.  Present  Arms.    This  is  a  three-count  movement,  used  to  salute  with  the  guidon  when rendering honors.  6.12.1.  Automatically release the flagstaff with the right hand and smartly re-grip the staff so that the thumb is behind the flagstaff and the four fingers are in front of the flagstaff, fingers are flared, knuckles facing forward.  This is called a “hand-flip.”  The hand-flip signals the COT to give the command of Present, ARMS.   Figure 6.13.  Present Arms [Hand-Flip]   6.12.2.  On the “P” of Present; using the right hand, raise the staff vertically in front of the right  shoulder,  with  right  arm  fully  extended  straight  forward  parallel  to  ground, simultaneously extend the left arm straight forward in the same fashion.  166 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 6.14.

CEREMONIES  Chapter 7 COLORS  Section 7A—General Information 7.1.  Background.    Throughout  history,  the  Colors,  otherwise  known  as  flags,  standards, banners,  and  pennants,  were  used to  represent  countries,  distinguished  governmental subdivisions, agencies, military units, officials, and functioned as forms of signaling devices.  In times of battle, the position of flagbearer was awarded to those who possessed supreme levels of bravery,  confidence,  and  loyalty.    The  flagbearer’s  mission  was  to  carry  the  Colors,  rally  the forces,  lead  the  charge,  and  protect  the  flags  with  their  lives,  if  necessary.    Armed  guardsmen were often assigned a position flanking the flagbearer to ensure the defense of the flag, forming a color guard.  Today, these color teams serve a significant ceremonial purpose and forever hold a place in America’s history, traditions, and protocol.  7.2.  Protocol.    Title  36,  United  States  Code  Chapter  10,  governs  flag  etiquette  and  protocol.  This  law  is  intended  to  always  maintain  the  U.S.  National  Flag  in  the  position  of  honor, whenever exhibited.  Military tradition has added its own customs in addition to that outlined in the U.S. Code.  7.2.1.  Individuals  will utilize AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2 and AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 2 for all flag protocol and guidance.  7.2.2.  For  guidance  regarding  flag  requirements  to  include  Personal  Colors  (PC)  refer  to Attachment 2, Table of Honors, in AFI 34-1201.  7.3.  Requirements.   It is the duty of all color team members to ensure the safety and security of the colors they are carrying.  Every precaution feasible should be taken to ensure this.  7.3.1.  Never dip the National flag.  7.3.2.  Only dip non-national flags at the appropriate times, i.e. during the playing of national anthems, muffled ruffles, Taps etc.  Refer to AFI 34-1201, paragraph 2.22.9. for specifics on dipping the USAF Departmental Flag. NOTE:   If the Pledge of Allegiance is given after the playing  of  the  National  Anthem  then  the  NCT  will  give  the  subdued  command  Bearers, Ready, TWO to return the USAF Flag to port or right shoulder.  The USAF Flag will not be dipped during the Pledge of Allegiance.  7.3.3.  Never  allow  a  flag  to  touch  the  ground.    Take  care  when  handling  flags/flag  staffs around doors, ceilings, people and other obstacles.  7.3.4.  The height of the team members should be as closely matched as possible.  If there is a noticeable difference in  members’ height, the team  should be arranged  in  an aesthetically pleasing manner (depending on the rank and experience level).  As a guide line, there should never be more than two inches between the tallest and shortest individuals on the team.  176 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 7.3.5.  The  NCOIC  of  the  color  team  (NCT)  will  be  holding  the  U.S.  or  National  flag  and will call commands from this position only.  7.3.6.  The NCT does not have to be the highest-ranking member of the team.  They should be the most experienced and qualified member to complete the mission successfully.  7.3.7.  The right rifle guard is the second most experienced and the left rifle guard should be the  third  most  experienced.  NOTE:    Honor  guards  should  make  every  effort  to  assign  the flagbearer duties to NCOs.  The rifle guards should be experienced Junior Enlisted Airmen.  7.3.8.  The flags should always be carried and displayed in proper order.  IAW AFI 34-1201, paragraph 2.11. the order (from front to rear when in column formation and from left to right as the audience views the team when in line formation) is as follows:  7.3.8.1.  National Emblems (i.e.: U.S. Flag, any other country flag).  7.3.8.2.  President of the United States (POTUS).  7.3.8.3.  State and Territorial Flags.  7.3.8.4.  Service Flags (Army, Marines Corp, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard).  7.3.8.5.  Organizational Flags.  7.3.8.6.  Personal  Color  (never  part  of  a  color  team;  pre-posted  i.e.:  VPOTUS,  CSAF, VCSAF, Generals’ Colors, POW/MIA Flags, etc.) NOTE:  If the color team is involving a visiting country or to honor another country, the order of display of the National flags is subject  to  change.  Refer  to  AFI  34-1201,  paragraph  2.10.5.  for  guidance  on  the  proper display of National flags.  7.3.9.  For all Air Force ceremonies, funerals and community relations events the color team will, at a minimum, consist of the U.S. and USAF Colors.  7.4.  Composition  and  Formation.    From  front  to  rear,  or  right  to  left,  the  order  will  be  the right rifle guard, the U.S. National Flag, State Flag (as required), USAF Colors, Organizational (as  required),  and  finally  the  left  rifle  guard.    Color  team  members  fall  in  at  the  position  of attention  in  one  or  two  formations  either  column  (single  file)  or  Line  (single  rank/abreast) formation.  7.4.1.  Column  (Single  File).    Maintain  a  closer  than  normal  40-inch  distance  to  the individual in front.  It should be about half that distance with the right rifle guard in front.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 177 Figure 7.1.  Column (Single File)   7.4.2.  Line  (Single  Rank/Abreast).    Maintain  a  close  interval,  approximately  four  inches (fist  distance)  between  color  team  member’s  shoulders,  when  halted.  A  “shoulder-to-shoulder”  interval  is  maintained  when  marching  in  this  formation.  NOTE:    It  is  not recommended to have more than six flags (eight-person team), as this would render the team difficult to maneuver.  Figure 7.2.  Line (Single Rank/Abreast)   7.4.3.  Location.    If  performing  a  military  funeral  without  an  armed  escort  and  the  USAF Band  (i.e.  SHF  for  AD  deaths,  MOH  recipients  and  repatriations)  then  the  color  team  is positioned at a minimum of 10 to 15 paces (depending on obstacles) and centered on the foot of  the  casket.    If  possible,  the  entire  family  should  be  able  to  see  the  color  team.  Always ensure the next of kin (NOK) can see the color team. Additionally, NCT should have a line of sight with the NCOIC/OIC at both roadside and gravesite.  7.5.  Responsibilities.    Each honor guard color team consist of at least  one flagbearer and two rifle guards.  7.5.1.  National  Flagbearer.    The  bearer  of  the  U.S.  flag  is  also  the  NCT.  The  NCT  is responsible  for  the  entire  color  team  including  PC.  The  NCT  is  responsible  for  the appearance, conduct, and performance of the color team.  They must ensure all members are well versed on their positions and ceremony sequences.  This includes making sure that (even 178 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 in the harness cup) the National Flag is never lower than other flags in display; although the flag  should  not  be  visibly  higher,  it  should  not  be  visibly  lower  either.    The  NCT  is responsible  for  calling  the  correct  command  at  the  right  time  and  in  a  way  that  other members of the team can hear the commands clearly and distinctly, without detracting from the  ceremony.    This  position  on  the  color  team  should  be  reserved  only  for  the  most experienced personnel.  The NCT should be an NCO.  7.5.2.  USAF Flagbearer.   Is generally the least experienced on the team and is responsible for performing all commands on the NCT’s command of execution.  7.5.3.  Right  and  Left  Rifle  Guards.    The primary responsibility of the right and  left rifle guards is to safeguard the National and Air Force Colors. The rifle guards keep unauthorized personnel  from  walking  between  the  colors  and  other  elements.  They  also  assist  in  the alignment of the colors and eyes for the NCT when the flag blocks vision during windy days, while marching.  Right rifle guard has the additional responsibility of placing the team in the pre-determined position when marching in column formation.  NOTE:  Right rifle guard also has the duty of setting the color team’s cadence, which should remain steady (should not be too fast or too slow).  Right rifle guard should be equally or second most experienced. Left rifle guard should be third most experienced.  7.6.  Equipment.  7.6.1.  Air Force Outdoor Ceremonies or Indoors with High Ceiling and Flags Will Not Be Posted:  7.6.1.1.  U.S. National Colors (4’4” X 5’6’).  7.6.1.2.  USAF  Colors  (4’4”  X  5’6’  with  campaign  streamers).  NOTE:    Remove streamers during inclement weather.  7.6.1.3.  Staffs of equal length (9’) and design; silver spade finial.  7.6.1.4.  Additional Colors as appropriate (i.e. state/territorial and organizational).  7.6.1.5.  Flag harnesses (black leather with high-gloss finish).  7.6.1.6.  Two rifles with white/black slings.  7.6.1.7.  White/black siliconed gloves.  7.6.1.8.  Ceremonial belts.  7.6.1.9.  PC with blue ceremonial case (as required).  7.6.2.  Air  Force  Indoor  Ceremonies  in  which  Flags  Will  Be  Posted  and/or  with  Low Ceiling:  7.6.2.1.  U.S. National Colors (3’x4’).  7.6.2.2.  USAF Colors (3’x4’).  7.6.2.3.  Staffs  of  equal  length  (7’  is  recommended/8’  is  an  option)  and  design;  silver spade finial.  7.6.2.4.  Flag harnesses (black leather with high-gloss finish).  7.6.2.5.  Two rifles with white slings.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 179 7.6.2.6.  White siliconed gloves.  7.6.2.7.  Ceremonial belts.  7.6.2.8.  Flag stands (chrome, pipe shaft on disc base).  7.6.2.9.  PC Colors with blue ceremonial case (as required).  7.6.3.  Joint Service (JS) Ceremonies (Indoor and Outdoor):  7.6.3.1.  USAF Colors (4’4”x5’6” with campaign streamers).  7.6.3.2.  Staff length of 9’with silver spade finial.  7.6.3.3.  Flag harness (black leather with high-gloss finish, see Figure 7.3.).  7.6.3.4.  White siliconed gloves.  7.6.3.5.  Ceremonial belts. NOTES:  1.  The two primary sizes of flags used are 3’x4’ and 4’4”x5’6".  Generally, the smaller flag is used for indoor ceremonies involving posting of the colors.  All flags within a color team will be the same size and style (ceremonial with fringe).  2.  The length of the staff is dependent on the flag’s size.  All staffs within a color team will be the same length, color and be affixed with the silver spade type finial.  Refer to AFI 34-1201, Chapter 2.  3.  IAW AFI 34-1201, flagstaffs will be ash in color.  Ash is a light/blonde  craft  wood  from  Ash  trees  and  is  best  known  as  the  wood  of  choice  for baseball bats.  Its appearance, elasticity, strength to weight ratio and durability make it ideal for flagstaffs.  Figure 7.3.  Flag Harness   180 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.4.  Flag Staff Nomenclature   7.6.4.  Weapons.    M1, M14, and Springfield 1903 rifles are authorized rifles for Air Force Color Teams. Replica/mock rifles should be avoided. Honor guards will make every attempt to acquire and utilize functional weapons, whether inert or operational.  See figures 2.14. and 4.1. for M14 and M1 rifle nomenclature.  7.6.4.1.  All  USAF  Honor  Guard  Color  Teams  will  be  armed  with  the  Springfield  1903 rifle.  Figure 7.5.  Springfield 1903 Rifle Nomenclature   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 181 7.6.4.2.  In  a  deployed/forward  operating  location  where  no  ceremonial  weapons  are available the M4 or M16 will only be used as a last resort, as mission dictates and only while performing ceremonies in the prescribed utility uniforms.  7.6.4.3.  Rifle  guards  are  authorized  to  carry  a  sidearm  (i.e.  M9  pistol  or  .38  caliber revolver) in a black patent leather holster if no rifles are available (figure 8.2.).  7.6.4.4.  Weapons will not be carried on color teams taking place inside a church or place of worship.  7.6.4.5.  USAF Color Team will never be armed with sabers/swords.  7.6.4.6.  Weapons will never be fixed with bayonets.  7.7.  Uniform Requirements.   Flag harnesses and the ceremonial belt will be worn for all color teams,  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  harness  will  be  used.    The  belt  will  be  worn  over  the harness.  The harness will be worn under the epaulets in all uniforms.  The left shoulder strap of the harness will be worn over and on top of the right strap when viewed from the rear, see Figure 7.3.   Chinstraps will always be worn in the down position.  7.7.1.  Hats will not be worn indoors if the color team is not under arms, i.e. inside a church or  place  of  worship.  EXCEPTION:    When  performing  as  a  flagbearer  during  an  indoor event and an armed color team is present during any portion of the event then the flagbearer will  wear  the  proper  headgear  in  order  to  maintain  uniformity  with  the  color  team throughout  the  ceremony.  NOTE:    When  performing  color  teams  in  the  Service  Dress uniform the harness is only worn if being utilized during the ceremony.  Airmen must adhere to AFI 36-2903 at  all times.  This  means, white gloves are not authorized in Service Dress and will not be worn by the color team when they are wearing the service uniform or service dress.  Although not a requirement, the Service Cap should be worn in these situations.  7.8.  Commands.    The  supplementary  command  of  Colors  will  be  called  for  all  commands when performing with another element (i.e. funerals when marching as part of the escort, during parades, etc.)  Example: Colors, Present, ARMS.  During funerals, commands should be called at  a  moderately  subdued  level.    They  should  not  be  disruptive  to  the  family.    At  all  other ceremonies, commands will be called in a manner and volume fitting to command the attention of the audience, without being disruptive, obnoxious or disrespectful.  7.8.1.  All  commands  echoed  by  the  NCT  are  performed  on  the  COT’s  command  of execution. Example: If the command Present, ARMS is given by the COT, the NCT echoes the command Present in between the COT’s Present and ARMS and the movement will be executed on the COT’s command of ARMS.  7.8.2.  All commands given or echoed by the NCT while marching are given and executed on the  left  foot,  except  Right  Shoulder,  ARMS,  Eyes,  RIGHT  and  Ready,  FRONT  (from eyes left only).  7.8.3.  Whenever  it  is  necessary  for  either  the  flagbearers  or  rifle  guards  to  perform movements  independently  from  each  other,  than  the  preparatory  command  of  Bearers,  for the flagbearers, or Guards, for the rifle guards, will be called.  The preparatory command of Colors is used to command the color team, both flagbearers and rifle guards. NOTE:  This is the  reason  that  the  preparatory  command  of  Colors  always  precedes  Ready,  CUT  when 182 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 moving  to  right shoulder regardless of whether or not the team is  performing with another element.  7.8.4.  NCT will call all  commands from  the same position as the rest  of  the team  and will execute the movement on their own command of execution.  7.8.5.  At  all  other  times,  NCTs  will  follow  the guidance  dictated  in  Chapter  2  of  AFMAN 36-2203.  Section 7B—Standing Flagstaff Manuals 7.9.  Position of Attention.   The flagstaff will be held in the right hand, palm on the front of the staff, fingers and thumb grasping the staff tightly.  The right index finger is extended down the centerline  of  the  staff.    The  right  arm  is  fully  extended  with  the  right  thumb  pinned  along  the seam of the trousers.  The pike of the staff is grounded approximately two inches from the side of  the  foot  and  in-line  with  the  second  eyelet  on  the  shoe  so  the  staff  is  perpendicular  to  the ground.    The  flag  is  secured  between  the  flagstaff  and  right  arm.    All  other  applicable requirements outlined in paragraph 2.1. will be adhered to.  Figure 7.6.  Attention   7.10.  Parade  Rest.    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Parade,  REST.  This  is  a  one-count movement performed from the position of attention.  On the command of execution, slap the left hand  sharply  in  the  small  of  the  back,  palm  out,  fingers  joined  and  extended.    Simultaneously and  briskly  move  the  left  foot  six  to  eight  inches  to  the  left  in  stomping  motion.  The  flagstaff remains at the position of attention.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 183 Figure 7.7.  Parade Rest  7.11.  Stand  At  Ease.    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Stand  At,  EASE.    This  is  a  two-count movement performed from the position of attention.  7.11.1.  (Count 1)  . On the command of execution, the left foot will move six to eight inches to the left in a slight stomping motion just enough for the foot to clear the ground and be an audible count. Feet will remain in-line and parallel with each other.   Figure 7.8.  Stand At Ease (Count 1)   7.11.2.  (Count 2)  . Members will raise their left hand to the “cup” on the harness, grasping it with a fist. Index finger will be rolled and tucked into the thumb; the thumb itself will be tucked under the remaining fingers. Thumb will not go into the “cup”. Metal of “cup” will be completely covered by the left hand. Right hand and flagstaff will stay the same throughout the movement. Maintain silence and immobility.  184 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.9.  Stand At Ease (Count 2)   7.11.3.  To return to attention.  The command is Stand-by, Colors, ATTENTION.  This is a two-count movement performed from the position of stand at ease.  7.11.4.  On  the  preparatory  command  of  Colors  return  to  the  position  of  parade  rest (paragraph 7.10. and figure 7.7.).  7.11.5.  On the command of execution, sharply return to the position of attention (paragraph 7.9.and figure 7.6.).  7.12.  Port Arms [From Attention].   The command for this movement is Port, ARMS.  This is a three-count  movement,  utilized to keep the colors mobile,  yet  close to  the ground.   It  is  used during the posting sequence and if there is low overhead clearance, whether indoors or outdoors.  7.12.1.  (Count  1)  .  Upon  the  command  of  execution,  ARMS,  the  flagbearers  will  bring their left  hand across the mid-section of the body and  grasp the flagstaff  approximately six inches below the midsection of the staff (left hand will be closer to the right at or below waist level) with the left hand.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 185 Figure 7.10.  Port Arms (Count 1)   7.12.2.  (Count  2)  .  Using  the  left  hand,  lift  the  flagstaff  four  to  six  inches  off  the  ground ensuring forearm is now parallel to the ground and across the midsection of the body.  Figure 7.11.  Port Arms (Count 2)   7.12.3.  (Count  3)  .    For  the  final  count,  the  flagbearers  will  place  their  hand  the  cut  hand (figure  1.12.)  position  across  the  front  of  their  abdomen.    Fingers  should  be  fully  extended and joined; thumb should be tucked behind the fingers (as if trying to touch the back of the pinky).        Hand  and  forearm  should  be  held  parallel  to  the  ground  and  approximately  four inches  (or  a  fist  away)  from  the  body.  NOTE:    Flared  hand  will  always  be  in  front  of  the flag.  186 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.12.  Port Arms (Count 3)   7.13.  Angle  Port  Arms.    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Bearers,  Ready,  TWO.  This command should always be given in a subdued manner.  The flag is  lowered at  a three second cadence.    This  is  the  only  authorized  period  where  the  U.S.  National  Flag  is  dipped.  Ensure subordinate  flags  are  not  angled  higher.    This  position  is  a  fundamental  starting/ending  point when marching with flagstaffs.  When marching at port arms or when ready to move the flag to the harness, angle port is necessary.  7.13.1.  Upon the command of execution, the flagbearers will lower their flags to a 45-degree angle.  Flagbearers should grasp the flagstaff at its midsection with their left hand and, while keeping their right arm extended downward, flare their right hand along the lower portion of the  flagstaff.    Fingers  of  the  right  hand  should  be  joined  with  the  natural  gap  of  the  thumb and  index  figure  resting  on  the  top  of  the  flagstaff.      Thumb  of  the  Right  hand  will  not  be visible  and  will  not  be  grasping  the  staff.    Right  hand  is  acting  like  a  counter  weight  not actually  gripping  the  staff.    NOTE:    Left  hand  grasps  the  flag  and  the  flag  staff.  Adjust accordingly to regain control of the flag if it comes loose.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 187 Figure 7.13.  Angle Port Arms   7.13.2.  To  go  back  to  (straight)  port  arms  the  command  of  Bearers,  Ready  TWO  will  be given again.  On the command of execution, flagbearers will slowly  raise the flag back to  a vertical position (at a three second cadence) and ensure that the flag is four to six inches of the ground.  Once in  the  vertical  position the flagbearers will slowly bring their hand to  the proper flare in front of the flag itself (Figure 7.12.).  7.14.  Order Arms [From Port].   The command for this movement is Order, ARMS. This is a two-count movement performed from the position of port.  7.14.1.  (Count 1)  . Upon the command of execution, flagbearers will allow the flagstaff to slide through their right hand to the ground allowing the pike to impact the marching surface no  more  than  once.    Do  not  grab  the  flagstaff  with  the  left  hand  until  the  pike  is  on  the ground.  188 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.14.  Order Arms [From Port] (Count 1)   7.14.2.  Next,  the flagbearers will grasp the mid-section of the flagstaff  with  their left  hand and “tuck” or “throw” the flag under and behind their right armpit using their right hand. The tucking  process  may  take  longer  for  individual  flagbearers  depending  on  the  situation.  Ensure to keep the torso and head facing forward while securing the flag.  Figure 7.15.  Flag “Tuck/Throw” [From Order]   7.14.3.  Once the flag has been secured, the flagbearers will re-grip the staff with their right hand and place their left hand in a flared position across the front of their abdomen.  Fingers should be fully extended and joined; thumb should be tucked behind the fingers.  Hand and forearm should be held parallel to the ground and approximately four inches or a fist length away from the body.  This is the ready cut position (Figure 7.14.).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 189 7.14.4.  At this point the command of Ready, CUT is given.  7.15.  Ready Cut [From Order].   The command for this movement is Ready, CUT.  This is a two-count movement used to return to the position of attention after completing order arms from port.  7.15.1.  (Count  1)  .  On  the  command  of  execution  of  CUT,  sharply  bring  the  left  forearm across the midsection of the body pinning the elbow to the side, simultaneously closing the hand  from  a  flared  position  to  a  fist  (hand  is  closed  as  if  at  the  position  of  attention).  Left elbow is now at a 90-degree angle with the forearm parallel to the ground.  Figure 7.16.  Ready Cut (Count 1)   7.15.2.  (Count 2)  . Sharply bring left hand down to the position of attention with knuckles parallel  to  the  ground  (Figure  7.6.).    NOTE:    Throughout  the  movement  of  ready  cut  is assumed  as  part  of  their  respective  order  or  shoulder  movement  and  may  not  be  written/ described thereafter to avoid redundancy.  7.16.  Present Arms [From Port].   The command for this movement is Present, ARMS.  This is a dip executed at a three second cadence.  7.16.1.  Upon the command of execution, the flagbearers will lower their flags to a 45-degree angle.  Flagbearers should grasp the flagstaff at its midsection with their left hand and, while keeping their right arm extended downward, flare their right hand along the lower portion of the flagstaff.  Fingers of the right hand should be joined and the thumb should be resting on the top  of the flagstaff. Right  hand is  acting like a counter weight  not  actually  gripping the staff. National  flagbearers will remain at  port  (Figure 7.13.).  NOTE:  Left  hand grasps  the flag  and  the  flag  staff.  Adjust  accordingly  to  regain  control  of  the  flag  if  it  comes  loose. Flagbearer must regain control of the flag at any and all times (this does mean even during the National Anthem).  7.16.2.  To return to port.  The command is Port, ARMS.  190 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 7.16.3.  On the “P” of the preparatory command  Port, flagbearers will slowly raise the flag back to a vertical position (at a three second cadence) and ensure that the flag is four to six inches  of  the  ground.  Once  in  the  vertical  position  the  flagbearers  will  slowly  bring  their hand to the proper flare in front of the flag itself (the left hand should be flared at “count 3” of the three second cadence (Figure 7.12.).  7.16.4.  To move to the order position.  The command is Order, ARMS.  7.16.5.  On  the  “D”  of  the  preparatory  command  Order,  return  the  flag  to  port  arms following  the  procedure  outlined  in  paragraph  7.16.3.    Next  perform  order  arms  from  port (paragraphs 7.14. and 7.15. and figures 7.12. and 7.14.).  7.17.  Right  Shoulder  Arms  [From  Attention].    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Right Shoulder, ARMS.  This movement is used to carry colors outdoors, or in an indoor venue with a high enough ceiling to accommodate the Colors.  7.17.1.  On  the  annunciation  of  the  “Sh”  in  Shoulder,  flagbearers  will  release  the  flagstaff with their right hand and re-grip so that the thumb is behind the flagstaff and the four fingers are in front of the flagstaff.  The four fingers will be closed and in-line in a modified flared position. This is the “hand-flip.”  Figure 7.17.  Right Shoulder Arms [From Attention] (Hand-Flip)   7.17.2.  Upon  the  command  of  execution,  the  flagbearers  will  “toss”  the  staff  through  the right hand, slightly loosening the grip and then re-gripping before the pike of the staff raises past  the  “cup”  of  the  harness.    The  flagbearer’s  right  hand  will  never  go  above  eye  level. Simultaneously,  once  the  flagstaff  has  been  tossed  up  to  the  harness,  the  left  hand  should guide the pike into the “cup” of the harness.  Flagbearers should never look down to find the cup of the harness.  7.17.3.  The flagbearer will guide the pike of the flagstaff into the cup on the harness with the left  hand.    The  left  hand  of  the  flagbearer  will  come  to  rest  at  a  fist  on  the  “cup”  of  the harness (still gripping the bottom of the staff).  The right hand will come to rest grasping the staff  at  eye  level,  with  the  wrist  “cranked”  around  so  that  the  flagbearer’s  first  row  of AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 191 knuckles  are  facing  the  nose.    The  right  forearm  should  be  at  a  45-degree  angle.    It  is imperative that all flagbearers keep their respective flags in a vertical position throughout this movement.  Figure 7.18.  Right Shoulder Arms [From Attention]  7.17.4.  Colors  Ready  Cut  [From  Right  Shoulder].    The  command  for  this  movement  is Colors,  Ready,  CUT.   This  is  a one-count  movement  given  from  the  ready  cut  position at right shoulder.  From its position at the cup of the harness, drop the left hand sharply to the position  of  attention.    A  subdued  Bearers,  Ready  Two  may  be  given  to  slowly  (at  a  three second  cadence)  return  the  left  hand  to  attention  and/or  back  to  the  flagstaff/cup  if  two-handed support is necessary. Guards,  Ready,  CUT will be called if flagbearers will not be removing their hands.   192 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.19.  Colors Ready Cut [From Right Shoulder]   7.18.  Present  Arms  [From  Right  Shoulder].    The  command  is  Present,  ARMS.    This movement is used to render honors when already at the position of right shoulder.  7.18.1.  On command of execution, dip the flag to a 45-degree angle with right hand cranked and staff resting on wrist  and forearm.  Use the  biceps and shoulder to  control and support the flag.  This dip will be performed for all non-national flags; never dip the American flag or the  flag  of  another  nation.  CAUTION:      Be  aware  of  the  proximity  to  the  audience  and/or other obstacles when dipping the flag.  If need be the angle of the dip can be less than 45-degrees.  Figure 7.20.  Present Arms [From Right Shoulder]   7.18.2.  To return to right shoulder.  On the annunciation of the “Sh” in Shoulder, return the flagstaff from the “dipped” salute to right shoulder using the same three-second count.  The right hand should remain “cranked” at all times.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 193 7.19.  Present Arms [From Attention].   The command is Present, ARMS.  This movement is used to render honors outdoors or when there is a high ceiling. Note: it is important to use this movement as much as possible. Generally when there is a large room, there is a large audience and everyone needs to see the National Flag(s) during the National Anthem(s). NOTE:  If there is  insufficient  overhead  clearance  (i.e.  team  is  under  a  tree),  the  NCT  will  instruct  the flagbearers  that  present  arms  will  be  executed  from  the  position  of  port.    On  the  command  of execution move to port then present arms (paragraphs 7.12. and 7.16.).  7.19.1.  Move to right shoulder in the same manner as outlined in paragraph 7.17. except that the “hand-flip” will be performed on the “S” of Present (figure 7.17.).  7.19.2.  When the staff has been secured in the harness, complete present arms as outlined in paragraph 7.18.  7.19.3.  To  finish  this  movement  the  NCT  will  give  the  subdued  command  of  Bearers, Ready Two.  The NCT and Air Force flag will proceed to cut their left hand to left side in a discreet three-second cadence (figure 7.20.).  7.20.  Order  Arms  [From  Right  Shoulder].    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Order, ARMS.  This is a two-count movement used to return to the position of attention.  7.20.1.  (Count  1)  .  Upon  the  command  of  execution,  lift  the  flag  from  the  “cup”  of  the harness.    Simultaneously  grasp  the  pike  of  the  staff  with  the  left  hand.    Place  your  right forearm in  a vertical  position  directly in  front of your right  shoulder and  press  the flagstaff against your right forearm.  Wrist should be turned out so the knuckles on the right hand are facing away from the body.  Figure 7.21.  Order Arms [From Right Shoulder] (Count 1)   7.20.2.  Count 2). Sharply lower the flagstaff to the ground with your right arm and grasp the staff at its midsection with your left hand and begin to secure the flag under your right arm.  Stop flag from hitting the ground and slowly drop it. Be careful not to impact the pike of the staff  on  the  floor/ground,  known  as  “piking.”    (figure  7.11.).  NOTE:    The  first  and  second 194 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 counts  are  in  cadence;  however  once  the  flagstaff  is  placed  back  to  the  ground,  the flagbearer will hold the staff with the left hand and tuck the flag under his or her right arm using  the  right  hand  and  bring  their  left  hand  back  to  the  Ready  Cut  position  at  each individual cadence.  7.20.3.  Complete order arms as outlined in paragraph 7.15. (figures 7.14. through 7.16.)  7.20.4.  To  order  arms  from  present  (from  attention).    The  command  for  this  movement  is Order, ARMS.  On the “D” of Order return the flagstaff from the “dipped” salute to right shoulder  using  the  same  three-second  count  (figure  7.19.).    The  right  hand  should  remain “cranked”  at  all  times.  Complete  order  arms  (from  right  shoulder)  as  outlined  in  paragraph 7.20.1. through 7.20.3 (figures 7.21.; 7.11.; 7.14 through 7.16.).  7.21.  Port Arms [From Right Shoulder].   The command is Port, ARMS.  This is a two-count movement used to bring the flags from the harness to the position of port, typically for posting the flags in flag stands.  7.21.1.  On  the  command  of  execution,  perform  order  arms  (from  right  shoulder) (paragraphs 7.20.1 and 7.20.2. and figure 7.21.) However, keep the pike of the staff four to six inches from the ground and do not tuck the flag.  The left hand will remain flared in front of the flag.  Do not call the “ready cut” command.  Figure 7.22.  Port Arms [From Right Shoulder]   7.21.2.  To  move  to  port  arms  from  present  [from  attention].    The  command  for  this movement is Port, ARMS.

The command for this movement is Split it, Shoulder,  ARMS.    It  is  used  to  bring  the  flags  up  into  the  harness  while  marching.    The command is only called when the team is marching in line formation. NOTE: While marching, right shoulder arms will never be performed from (straight) port.  Flagbearers will always start at angle port prior to performing right shoulder arms.  7.22.1.  On the command Split it individuals will break shoulder contact and move to a close interval distance (four inches).  7.22.2.  Given on the right foot, on the command of ARMS, execute Right Shoulder Arms in the  same  manner  as  the  standing  movement  (paragraph  7.17.)  on  the  next  available  step.  There is no need for a “hand-flip” as the right hand grip is in the proper angle port position.  Upon completion, the multi-purpose Bearers, Ready, TWO is given to slowly (three-count) return the left hand to the position of attention.  Figure 7.23.  Right Shoulder Arms [From Angle Port]  7.22.3.  When  in  column  formation  flagbearers  will  move  to  right  shoulder  by  the  ripple.  There  will  be  no  command  called.    The  movement  will  start  with  the  lead  rifle  guard beginning on the left foot.  Each member will begin the movement on the next left step after the individual in front of them begins the movement.  Bring the flagstaff to the harness in the same manner as described in paragraph 7.20.2.  Each flagbearer will discreetly (three-count) cut their left hands from the flag harness cup on their own cadence.   196 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.24.  Rippled Right Shoulder Arms (Column Formation)   7.23.  Angle  Port  Arms  [From  Right  Shoulder  Arms].    The command for this movement  is Split It, Port, ARMS.  It is used to remove the flags from the harness while marching, usually due  to  an  overhead  obstacle.    NOTE:  While  marching,  flagbearers  will  always  assume  the position of angle port when bringing the flag out of the harness.  7.23.1.  On the command Split It individuals will break shoulder contact and move to a close interval distance (four inches).  7.23.2.  Given from the left foot, on the command of ARMS, execute Port Arms in the same manner as the standing movement (paragraph 7.21.) on the next available step.

Complete count five of left shoulder arms [from port] (paragraph 7.35.3.5. and figure 7.46.).  Section 7E—Marching Rifle Manuals 7.36.  Right  Shoulder  Arms  [From  Port].    The  command  for  this  movement  is  Split  It, Shoulder, ARMS.  The command is only called when the team is marching in line formation.  7.36.1.  On the command Split It individuals will break shoulder contact and move to a close interval distance (four inches) (figure 7.23.).  7.36.2.  Given on the right foot, on the command of ARMS, execute Right Shoulder Arms in the  same  manner  as  the  standing  movement  (paragraph  7.34.3.)  on  the  next  available  step (figure 7.23.).  7.36.3.  When in column formation rifle guards will execute right shoulder by the ripple. The movement  will  be  initiated  by  the  right  rifle  guard,  and  is  intended  to  raise  the  Colors immediately  after  overhead  obstacles  (i.e.  doorways  or  ceilings).    Perform  the  marching manual in the same manner described in paragraphs 7.34.3 and 7.35.3. starting with the right (lead) rifle guard, and continuing down the team on each subsequent left foot (figure 7.24.).  7.37.  Port Arms [From Right Shoulder Arms].   The command for this movement is Split it, Port, ARMS.  It is used to remove the flags from the harness while marching, usually due to an overhead obstacle.  7.37.1.  On the command Split it individuals will break shoulder contact and move to a close interval distance (four inches) (figure 7.25.).  7.37.2.  Given from the left foot, on the command of ARMS, execute port arms in the same manner as paragraphs 7.34.4. and 7.35.4. on the next available step (figure 7.25.).  7.37.3.  When in column formation rifle guards will execute port by the ripple. The manual will  be  initiated  by  the  right  rifle  guard,  and  is  intended  to  lower  the  Colors  immediately before an overhead obstacle (i.e. doorways or ceilings).  Perform the marching manual in the same  manner  described  in  paragraphs  7.34.4.  and  7.35.4.  starting  with  the  right  (lead)  rifle guard,  and  continuing  down  the  team  on  each  subsequent  left  foot  (figure  7.26.)NOTE: Ripple  to  port  is  also  accomplished  when  dismissing  or  retiring  the  Colors  after  the completion of a ceremony when the color team is part of a larger formation.  The team will perform  a  “colors  turn”  after  ordered  to  dismiss/retire  the  Colors,  upon  completion  of  the turn, the right rifle guard will initiate the ripple on the fifth step.    216 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Section 7F—Advanced Rifle Manuals 7.38.  General.   Advanced drill rifle manuals are not permitted within color teams.  This type of drill  detracts  from  the  dignity  and  singular  importance  of  the  Colors.    The  only  advanced  rifle movement utilized by the colors flight is the Single Count Present Arms reserved specifically for the  3-person  Foreign  National  (FN)  Teams  executed  on  the  Air  Force  Full  Honors  Wreath-Laying Ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknowns (TUS). Defined simply, it is the movement of “dropping” the rifle from right (or left) shoulder and “catching” it at present arms in one count.  The movement is executed on the same count as the halt (heel click).  Section 7G—Control and Movement of the Color Team 7.39.  Forward March.   The command is Forward, MARCH and is used to advance the color team  in  unison  from  either  formation.    From  the  halted  abreast  formation,  begin  closing  to “shoulder-to-shoulder”  interval  upon  the  first  step.    At  times,  marching  movements  (forward, mark time, or ready-steps) are done without commands.  This is traditionally accomplished by a drumbeat known as Four Flams; a four-count drum beat with the color team stepping off on the fifth beat.  Conversely, the team may be halted using the seven-count drumbeat.  The command of Ready, STEP will be used to advance the team individually, each member after the other.  7.39.1.  Color  Team  Interval  While  Marching.    In  a  column  formation  normal  40-inch distance  (or  about  half  that,  if  necessary)  will  be  maintained.    When  marching  abreast,  the team will maintain shoulder contact.  In the event the “shoulder-to-shoulder” interval needs to  be  expanded,  the  NCT  has  the  discretion  of  using  the  discreet  Split-It  command  or  the team may “split” automatically, using three dead-step counts during the command of Colors, HALT.  7.39.2.  To  split  the  team:    In  between  the  command  of  Colors  and  HALT  NCT  (or  the center  flagbearer)  will  maintain  their  current  position  as  the  other  flagbearer(s)  and  rifle guards  move  away  to  obtain  a  fist  distance  away  from  each  other.    As  a  rule  of  thumb  the team should always split if any manuals are to be performed after the halt.  If the team will immediately step off without performing any rifle drill movements then Colors, HALT will be called normally and the team will not split.  7.39.3.  The  majority  colors  turns,  halts  and  mark  times  may  be  accomplished  without commands using the Four-Flams or the Seven-Count Drum Beat.  7.40.  Mark Time.   The command is given from the position of attention or while marching and is  used  to  suspend  progress.    This  command  can  be  given  in  any  colors  formation.    All  color teams will follow the guidance outlined in paragraph 2.6.  7.41.  Colors  Turn.    There are two positions in  which a colors turn is  executed: When in  line formation at the position of attention and in column formation at the position of mark time.  7.41.1.  From a Halt.  The command is Colors, Colors Turn, MARCH.  This movement is also  referred  to  as  a  colors  turn  off  because  it  is  used  as  a  method  of  departure  after positioning the color team.  7.41.1.1.  Upon  the  command  of  execution,  the  team  will  begin  a  mark  time  with  their left foot simultaneously turning 22.5-degrees to the right on each of the first four steps.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 217 On  the  fifth  step  the  team  will  automatically  Forward  March  with  a  natural  stepping motion and sliding the left foot to give the whole team a chance to get in step.  Figure 7.47.  Colors Turn On   7.41.2.  From  a  Mark  Time.    The  command  of  Colors  will  be  given  on  the  left  heel  beat.  This  movement  is  also  referred  to  as  a  colors  turn  on  because  it  is  used  as  a  method  of positioning  the  color  team  at  a  predetermined  location.    This  movement  is  also  used  after dismissing or retiring the Colors from a formation/ceremony  7.41.2.1.  Immediately upon this command, each team member will begin to rotate 22.5-degrees to the left on each of the next three heel beats.  On the fourth heel beat after the command of Colors, the command of HALT will be given.  The team then halts on their right foot and proceed to close with their left. NOTE:  When the team is at a mark time each member picks up his or her feet to about the lower portion of calf.  Ensure the team moves in closely in a manner that is almost “kneeing” the individual in front.  By doing this,  it  will  give  the  correct  distance  of  a  “fist”  length  distance  between  each  person’s shoulder when the turn is completed.  Figure 7.48.  Colors Turn Off  7.42.  Every (Other) Left On/Off.    There are two positions in which a left on/off is executed: When in line formation at the position of attention and in column formation while marching.  7.42.1.  On. The Every (Other) Left On movement describes a color team marching on to a predetermined  position  with  each  member  of  the  team  arriving  on  their  spots  individually, following the right rifle guard, picking up an automatic mark time with the first available left foot.  The purpose of the Every (Other) Left On is to ensure that the national flag remain in  218 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 the  position  of  honor.    The  movement  is  necessary  when  entering  from  the  audience’s  left side.  Figure 7.49.  Every (Other) Left On  7.42.2.  Off.  The Every  (Other)  Left Off describes the team’s departure  off their positions, one  after  the  other,  departing  on  each  subsequent  (or  next  available)  left  step  either automatically  by  the  right  rifle  guard  or  with  the  subdued  command  Ready,  STEP.    This movement is generally used as the reverse approach/departure of the colors turn movement. The  Every  (Other)  Left  Off  is  used  when  departing  to  the  audience’s  right  side  or  when marching directly down the middle of the room. NOTE:  The command Ready, STEP is only used  when  absolutely  necessary.    The  right  rifle  guard  should  be  experienced  enough  to complete  the  mission  without  the  use  of  the  command  and  NCT  will  ensure  that  there  is enough practice time to ensure the right rifle guard is able to perform as required.  Use of this command  by  a  color  team  puts  the  team’s  abilities  and  competence  in  question.    Remedial training  may  be  required  if  a  team  does  not  gain  the  proficiency  required  to  perform  this movement without the use of commands.  Figure 7.50.  Every (Other) Left Off    7.43.  Right/Left Turn.   This movement describes the rotation of the team to the right or left in a sweeping 90-degree arc using the left or right rifle guard as the pivot.  It is generally executed while marching forward in the line formation.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 219 7.43.1.  The command Right/Left Turn, MARCH is called on the same foot as the direction of the turn.  This command is given while the team is marching. As a rule, six steps are used for  a  four-person  team,  adding  two  additional  steps  for  each  additional  team  member.  Resume forward march upon completion of the turn.  7.44.  Right/Left Wheel.   This movement can be executed only when the team is abreast and is used to rotate the team 90-degrees to the left/right.  This movement should be executed in eight counts for a four-person team and ten counts for a five-person team.  7.44.1.  The command is Right/Left  Wheel,  MARCH.  This command,  Right/Left  Wheel can be given in the same breath or on each consecutive step depending on the quickness of the wheel.  This command can be given from the position of attention or mark time.  Upon the command of execution, all team members should begin to rotate the team in a wheeling manner  in  the  appropriate  direction.    It  is  very  important  that  rifle  guards  provide  enough shoulder and hip pressure to keep the team tight.  The pivot point for this movement should be the center of the team.  The team should stay in a straight line through the duration of the movement. Upon the completion of the turn, either the command of Forward, MARCH or Colors,  HALT  will  be  given  on  a  left  heel  beat.    NOTE:    As  with  all  commands  that correspond to  a direction (i.e. eyes left, column right etc.); this command  will be called on the foot of the direction the team is turning.  7.45.  Left  About.    This  movement  can  be  executed  only  when  the  team  is  in  line  formation.  This  movement  is  used  to  rotate  the  color  team  180-degrees  while  keeping  the  national  flag  in the position of honor.   This  movement  should be completed in  eighteen  counts (first  two steps are  considered  dead  steps)  for  a  four-person  team  and  twenty-two  counts  (first  two  steps  are counted as dead steps) for a five-person team.  7.45.1.  The command is Left About, MARCH.  This command, Left About is given from mark  time.    When  executed  from  mark  time,  the  count  begins  on  the  foot  following  the command of execution.  7.45.2.  Upon the command of execution, all team members should begin to rotate the team in  a wheeling manner to  the left.    It  is  very important  that  guards provide enough shoulder and  hip  pressure  to  keep  the  team  tight.    The  pivot  point  for  this  movement  should  be  the center  of  the  team.    The  team  should  stay  in  a  straight  line  through  the  duration  of  the movement and should not “bow” in the middle.  Upon the completion of the turn, either the command of Forward, MARCH or Colors, HALT will be given on a left heel beat.  7.46.  Eyes  Right  (Left).    The command is Eyes,  Right  (Left).  This  command takes six heel beats to perform.  On the preparatory command of Eyes, given on the right foot, six paces before the honoree, all non-national flagbearers dip their flags.  On the fifth heel beat the command of execution  of  RIGHT  (LEFT)  is  given.    On  the  sixth  heel  beat  all  members  of  the  team excluding the right (left) rifle guard sharply snap their heads 45-degrees to the right; dressing to the right (left) rifle guard.  220 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.51.  Eyes Right   7.46.1.  Ready Front.   The command is Ready, FRONT.  It takes six heel beats to perform.  On the preparatory command of Ready, given on the left (right) foot, six paces after passing the honoree, flags are returned to the shoulder position.  On the fifth heel beat the command of execution is given on the left (right) foot.  On the sixth heel beat all members of the team return their heads to the forward position.  7.47.  Position  Adjustments.    Use  the  following  discreet/subdued  commands  to  make  minor adjustments  to  the  color  team  positions.    Shift  LEFT/RIGHT  (side  stepping  while  marking time) and Up (moving forward while marking time or advising the cut hand is at the ready cut position).    Ready,  STEP  or  Ready,  MOVE  (used  to  close/open  ranks  and  stabilize  the  team during extremely windy conditions especially at present arms).  7.47.1.  Within the color team, the flag oftentimes hampers vision.  This especially affects the team, especially when the NCT is  “blinded” from obstacles or direction of travel.  Discreet and limited conversation is permitted regarding any needed adjustments.  7.48.  Dress Center Dress.   Color teams will follow the guidance outlined in paragraph 2.10.1. except that all movements will be completed in a three second cadence. NOTE:  If the team does not  have  designated  marks  (T’s)  then  the  team  will  dress  to  either  the  right  or  left  rifle  guard depending on the situation.  Section 7H—Implementation 7.49.  General Ceremony Components.  7.49.1.  Pre-ceremony.    The  color  team  falls  in  out  of  sight  of  the  audience  or  behind  the troop formation no-later-than 10 minutes prior to the start of the ceremony.  If the ceremony is a funeral without an escort (an armed flight and the USAF Band) then the team will be pre-posted at gravesite 15 minutes prior to the start of the ceremony.  7.49.2.  Advancement  (Receiving  the  Colors).    On  cue  or  by  command,  the  color  team formally  marches  into  position,  in  front  and  centered  on  the  audience  or  troop  formation.  (The advancement and initial presentation to the troop formation is informally referred to as “taking colors”).  7.49.3.  Presentation.  The formal presentation of the US National Colors to the audience or command  and  the  rendering  of  honors  during  the  playing  of  the  National  Anthem,  To  the Colors, recitation of the  Pledge of Allegiance or similar tribute.  Generally, the rifle guards will  assume  present  arms  to  cue  the  tribute.    During  Change  of  Command  ceremonies  or AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 221 similar  events,  the  Colors  will  face  towards  the  command  (official  party).    Do  not  face towards the troop formation or audience.  7.49.4.  Posting (if necessary).  Posting the Colors in stands is accomplished when the Colors are required for static display in certain ceremonies.  The color team itself may also display the Colors by carrying them throughout the duration of a ceremony.  7.49.5.  Retrieval  (if  necessary).    Retrieving  the  Colors  from  stands  is  accomplished  when formal retirement of posted (in stands) Colors is required for certain ceremonies.  7.49.6.  Dismissal and Retirement.  Dismissal of the Colors occurs with every ceremony. It describes  the  Colors’  departure  from  the  forefront  and  return  to  the  pre-ceremony  area  for fallout.    Formal  retirement  of  the  Colors  occurs  within  the  context  of  the  ceremony  and describes the honors rendered to the flags before they are dismissed and secured.  7.50.  Posting/Retrieving In/From Stands.   The following sequences can be performed during ceremonies that include, but are not limited to Air Force Indoor Retirements, Awards Banquets, Luncheons, Promotions and Graduation Ceremonies.  Posting the Colors in stands is common for indoor  ceremonies  and  is  usually  not  performed  outdoors.  Retrieving  the  Colors  is  at  the discretion of the POC and is not necessary.  7.50.1.  Posting.  There are ten segments to the posting sequence, beginning at port arms and facing the audience after the presentation of the Colors.  7.50.2.  The  first  segment  is  executed  by  performing  a  three-count  about  face;  during  this sequence  (initiated  by  the  flagbearer  furthest  to  the  left)  the  third  count  is  a  step-off.    All flagbearers execute the movement simultaneously—using their peripheral vision.  7.50.3.  Next, the flagbearers take the appropriate amount of steps to their respective stands, moving with the NCT.  These step counts are predetermined.  7.50.4.  Once in position in front of the stands, each flagbearer’s head will drop as the Colors are centered above the stand and simultaneously slid within the stand in a slow fluid motion.  The flagbearers then raise their heads and hands to begin the dressing sequence.  7.50.5.  Dress  the  flags  with  the  top  edge  to  the  right,  both  hands  holding  the  flag  at  equal height  between  each  flagbearer.    Place  the  “fringe”  of  the  flag  to  the  right  and  the  flags should be in a “diamond” or “triangle” shape.  Dress the flags towards the audience.  7.50.6.  Slightly tugging the flag, the NCT initiates a three-second head raise looking at the spade. NOTE:  For more than two flagbearers, the middle bearer tugs the flag to initiate the head-raise.  7.50.7.  Immediately  after  the  flagbearers  raise  their  heads,  they  will  bring  their  right  hand behind the flag in a three-second cadence, and grasp the staff while maintaining their grip on the flag. Use the right hand to adjust and “flatten” the spades towards the audience  7.50.8.  When all movements have ceased, flagbearers will return their right hands in a three-second cadence to the dress position.  7.50.9.  The NCT slightly tugs the flag to initiate the team’s three-second head-drop to face forward and re-dress the flags.  222 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 7.50.10.  When  all  movements  have  ceased,  both  arms  are  extended  forward,  palms  down, parallel  to  the  ground  with  a  three-second  count,  hands  flared  and  brought  back  to  the position of attention, with another three-second count.  7.50.11.  The flagbearers take half a step back together and execute a three-count about face, or face each other depending on the placement of the stands, and return to the team without closing the feet, stepping off and taking the appropriate amount of steps to return to the team. NOTES:  1.    When  stepping  off  to  post  the  Colors,  the  amount  of  steps  needed  for  posting should be the same amount when returning to the team after the posting is complete. 2.  The rifle guards stand fast throughout the posting sequence.  The NCT always waits for the other flagbearers to complete their movements before beginning the next step.  7.50.12.  Retrieving.    Retrieving  flags  from  stands  involves  the  same  fundamental  steps  as posting,  without  the  dressing  sequence.    The  flags  are  removed  from  the  stands  in  and brought back to the color team in unison.  7.50.13.  Once  the  flags  have  been  retrieved  from  the  stands  and  held  at  straight  port  the flagbearers will take half a step back with the left foot, execute a three-count about face, or face each other depending on the placement of the stands, and return to the team.  Figure 7.52.  Posting In Stands   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 223 Figure 7.53.  Retrieving From Stands  7.51.  Positional/Personal  Colors  (PC  Bearer).    For the purpose of this training manual, PCs describe  any  flag  carried/posted  separately  from  that  of  the  color  teams.    The  POW/MIA  Flag and Personal  and Positional  Colors in  some instances are  examples of this.  As a rule, PCs are not carried by the color team, and when required, are pre-posted when indoors.   7.51.1.  PC bearer must be tall enough for the flag to clear the ground when in the unfurling and furling positions.  To perform as a PC bearer, honor guards will only use members under six feet tall as a last resort.  7.51.2.  The  PC  bearer  is  responsible  for  checking  out  all  the  equipment,  to  include  a  flag harness, a flag bearing the rank of the person being honored and a cover for the flag.  7.51.3.  The  PC  bearer  will  present  arms  by  taking  the  command  of  the  color  team  or OIC/NCOIC.  Once  the  flag  is  in  the  harness  for  change  of  commands,  promotions, retirements,  and  POW/MIA  events,  it  will  remain  there  until  posted.  The  PC  bearer  will remain at right shoulder unless commanded to present. To present, the PC bearer will follow the same procedures as in Section 7B. EXCEPTION:  To salute while at straight port the PC bearer will bring the flared left hand, with palm facing the ground across and in front of the abdomen.  Left arm will be parallel to the ground and four inches away from the body.  7.51.4.  The  only  time  a  PC  bearer  will  not  be  at  Right  Shoulder  Arms  is  when  they  are posting or furling/unfurling the flag.  7.51.5.  There  may  be  situations  in  which  the  PC  bearer  must  combine  multiple  flagstaff manuals in order to adhere to protocol requirements.  An example is when the PC bearer is 224 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 positioned near an Honor Cordon at attention and must quickly step off to proceed through the cordon.  7.51.5.1.  Once the official has passed the PC bearer, the PC bearer will immediately drop the  hand  present  (pinning  it  to  the  left  leg),  if  applicable,  while  simultaneously performing a hand-flip with the right hand, bring the flagstaff to right shoulder and step off with the left foot.  Figure 7.54.  PC Bearer Combination Movement.  7.52.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors at Military Funerals.   Refer to both AFI 34-1201 and AFPAM 34-1202 for detailed guidance regarding furling/casing of PCs.   7.52.1.  PC will only be cased at the individual’s interment.  The furler (the individual that is feeding  the  flag  into  itself  as  its  being  furled  after  the  flag  is  thrown  down  into  the  furling position)  is  also  known  as  the  NCOIC  and  will  be  an  NCO.    For  general/flag  officer’s funerals an Officer should be used to fill the role of OIC.  For proper PC bearer placement at gravesite refer to Figure A4.5.  The Furling/Casing Sequence absolutely will not be used for General Officer retirements; there are no exceptions to this.  7.52.2.  The PC bearer takes the position of honor (right  of the furler)  when the dignitary’s flag  is  displayed.    The  furler  and  PC  bearer  will  furl  in  full  view  of  the  ceremony  and audience.  7.52.3.  Furling/Casing the flag will be executed from right shoulder.  7.52.4.  The  furler  moves  into  position  to  the  side  of  the  flag  by  taking  two  steps  forward, halting and executing an automatic right face all in cadence and with heel clicks.  The furler will complete the facing movement on the final count of the PC bearer’s movement.  7.52.4.1.  (Count  1)  .    On  the  furler’s  first  heel  click  after  taking  two  steps  forward, execute count 1 of order arms from right shoulder.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 225 Figure 7.55.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Count 1).   7.52.4.2.  (Count  2)  .  On the furler’s first count of right face, smartly grasp the flag at the midsection.  Figure 7.56.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Count 2).   7.52.4.3.  (Count 3)  . On the furler’s final count of right face, with snap, place the staff into the right armpit horizontal and parallel with the ground.  226 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.57.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Count 3).   7.52.5.  From this position the furler will help to guide the flag as the bearer furls, with the case draped over the furler’s left arm, open end inside the arm.  7.52.6.  Rolling  the  flagstaff  may  be  done  clockwise  or  counter-clockwise  as  the  situation dictates  and  to  facilitate  the  assistance  of  the  furling  individual  (always  furl  away  from  the furler).  Once the furling is complete, ensure the spade is flat and is parallel to the ground.  Figure 7.58.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Flag Furling).  7.52.7.  The  furler  removes  the  case  from  the  arm  using  the  right  hand.    The  case  is  then slipped over the flag and tied in a single knot, if applicable.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 227 Figure 7.59.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Flag Casing).  7.52.8.  After  casing  the  flag,  the  furler  will  place  both  hands  on  top  of  the  flag  in  a  flared position with index fingers touching.  At the same time the PC bearer will flip the left hand on top of the flagstaff at a flare.   Figure 7.60.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Hand-Flips).  7.52.9.  The next  movement  is  initiated by the  furler.  The furler will extend both  arms out just  past  shoulder  width.    Simultaneously,  the  PC  bearer  will  extend  the  left  arm  forward along the flag staff, matching the same rate of speed as the furler, until both members finger tips come in contact.   228 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.61.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Arm Extension).  7.52.10.  Next the furler will return to the position of attention and at the same time the PC bearer will pin the left hand.   Figure 7.62.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Pin).  7.52.11.  Using a flared left hand the PC bearer will firmly hit the flagstaff from underneath, sharply returning the flagstaff to straight port.   Figure 7.63.  Furling and Casing Personal Colors (Return to Port).   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 229 7.52.12.  After PC bearer assumes port the furler will then take the position of honor next to the PC bearer.  7.53.  Uncasing/Unfurling  Personal  Colors than  Military Funerals.    Refer to both AFI 34-1201 and AFPAM 34-1202 for additional guidance regarding uncasing/unfurling of PCs.  for  Ceremonies  other 7.53.1.  Uncasing/Unfurling  PCs  will  only  be  performed  for  General  Officer  promotion ceremonies.  7.53.2.  The PC bearer will only carry the flag at port arms for these types of ceremonies.  7.54.  Colonel  to  Brigadier  General  Promotion.    PC  bearer  and  furler  stop  at  predetermined position.  Figure 7.64.  PC Bearer and Furler at Predetermined Position.  7.54.1.  Once  stopped  the  furler  moves  into  position  to  the  side  of  the  flag  by  taking  two steps  forward,  halting  and  executing  an  automatic  left  face  all  in  cadence  and  with  heel clicks.  The furler will complete the facing movement on the final count of the PC bearer’s movement.  7.54.1.1.  (Count 1)  .  On the furler’s first heel click after taking two steps forward, the PC bearer will pin the left hand.   Figure 7.65.  Uncasing Personal Colors (Count 1).   230 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 7.54.1.2.  (Count 2)  .  On the furler’s first count of left face, smartly grasp the flag at the midsection.  Figure 7.66.  Uncasing Personal Colors (Count 2).  7.54.1.3.  (Count  3)  .  On the furler’s final count of left face, with snap, place the staff into the right armpit horizontal and parallel with the ground.   Figure 7.67.  Uncasing Personal Colors (Count 3).   7.54.2.  When the flag is in position, the furler unties the case, if applicable, slips it off, and places  it  over  the  left  arm.    The  furler  then  performs  the  appropriate  facing  movement  and proceeds to the departure area.  The flag is unfurled and stopped with the spade parallel to the ground.  Using a flared left hand the PC bearer will firmly hit the flagstaff from underneath, sharply  returning  the  flagstaff  to  straight  port  (paragraphs  7.52.10.  and  7.52.11.).    The  PC bearer continues with predetermined route to post the flag or exit.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 231 Figure 7.68.  Furler Removes Case and Departs.  Figure 7.69.  PC Bearer Unfurls Flag.    7.55.  Promotions to Major General and Above.   After one of the PC bearers has retrieved the old rank they will march to the predetermined position, meeting the PC bearer holding the new rank and the furler at the center of the room.  The PC bearer with the new rank and the furler will always  be  positioned  so  that  the  furler  is  closest  to  and  on  the  side  of  the  audience.    All  three members will meet at the center of the room and halt at the same time.  Figure 7.70.  PC Bearers and Furler at Predetermined Position.   232 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 7.55.1.  Upon halting the furler and both PC bearers will perform the movements described in paragraphs 7.54.1.1 through 7.54.1.3.  Figure 7.71.  Uncasing Personal Colors (Double PC Bearer).  7.55.2.  When  the  flags  are  in  position,  the  furler  unties  the  case,  if  applicable,  slips  it  off, and  places  it  over  the  left  arm.    The  furler  then  performs  the  appropriate  facing  movement and proceeds to the departure area.  7.55.3.  Once the furler has departed, both PC bearers will proceed to unfurl and furl the flags simultaneously.  The PC bearer holding the new rank will initiate the movement by giving an eye wink using the eye away from the audience.   Figure 7.72.  Unfurling and Furling Personal Colors.  7.55.4.  Once the old rank has been furled and the new rank is unfurled both PC bearers will pause for about 3 seconds for any photo opportunities before returning to straight port.  The PC  bearer  with  the  new rank  will  again  initiate  the  movement  with  an  eye  wink.    Both  PC bearers will return to straight port as described in paragraph 7.54.2.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 233 Figure 7.73.  PC Bearers Return to Straight Port.   7.55.5.  The  PC  bearer  holding  the  old  rank  will  proceed  to  the  departure  area.    The  PC bearer holding the new rank will continue with  predetermined route to  post  the flag or  exit with the other PC bearer, with new rank leading.  7.56.  Joint  Service  Color  Teams.    Joint  Service  Color  Teams  will  only  be  used  for  official joint  ceremonies.    An  official  joint  ceremony  is  one  that  is  performed  within  a  joint  command under  an  individual(s)  that  command  members  from  two  or  more  services.    An  Air  Force ceremony taking place on a “Joint Base,” usually, does not fit this criterion.  Furthermore, an Air Force  ceremony  with  members  from  other  services  in  attendance  is  not  considered  a  joint ceremony either.  7.56.1.  Occasions  in  which  Base  Honor  Guard  members  participate  in  a  joint  color  team should be rare and limited only to those requests approved by all services participating in the event.  7.56.2.  When performing in a joint color team all service members will wear the equivalent uniform (Class As or Bs, Utilities etc.) and Air Force members will adhere to all Air Force guidance.  7.56.3.  Refer  to  AFI  34-1201,  paragraph  2.11.7.19.  for  proper  setup  of  a  joint  color  team.  For teams not including a member from all five branches, follow the guidance outlined in the following paragraphs:  Figure 7.74.  Joint Service Color Team.   234 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 7.75.  Joint Service Color Team Performing Inside the National Cathedral.   7.56.4.  The senior service will always be in charge of the color team, carry the U.S. flag and perform as NCT.  7.56.5.  The  senior  service  will,  in  most  cases  perform  as  the  right/lead  rifle  guard.  Exceptions to this are based on the number and types of flags being carried by the team.  7.56.6.  The service subordinate (usually 2nd in precedence) to the right/lead rifle guard will perform as the left/trailing rifle guard.  7.56.7.  All service members will carry their respective service flag.  Higher precedent flags will be carried by the more senior services.  7.56.8.  Both rifle guards will carry the same type of rifle regardless of the circumstances or service’s customs.  Figure 7.76.  Joint Service Presidential Escort Color Team.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 235 7.56.9.  The  manuals,  movements  and  position  of  the  hands  at  attention  that  are  shown  in figures 7.74. through 7.77. are under the guidance of the Military District of Washington and the  3rd  Infantry  Division  (The  Old  Guard)  and  are  unique  to  service  level  honor  guards assigned  to  the  National  Capitol  Region.    All  installation  level  teams’  rifle  and  flagstaff manuals;  and  ceremony  procedures  will  be  done  IAW  the  senior  services’  standard regulations.  Figure 7.77.  Navy and Air Force Joint Color Team.   7.57.  Flag Folding for Retirement Ceremonies.   The flag folding ceremony is not an official part of the Air Force retirement ceremony. If manning permits, honor guards may perform flag folds  as  “special  presentations.”    Only  the  two-person  flag  fold  will  be  performed  during individual  retirement  ceremonies.    The  ceremonial  uniform  will  not  be  worn  while  performing this ceremony.  7.57.1.  Music will not be played during the flag fold.  7.57.2.  Flag  folding  will  be  performed  IAW  paragraphs  9.33.  and  9.35.  of  this  manual;  as well as AFI 34-1202, paragraph 2.15.  7.57.3.  At  the  appropriate  time  the  NCOIC  commands  Ready,  STEP  in  a  normal conversational  tone.    This  is  the  only  command  given  by  the  NCOIC  throughout  the ceremony.    NCOIC  and  Fold  step  off  together,  shoulder-to-shoulder  and  Fold  will  have suspended arm swing.  7.57.4.  NCOIC will have the flag in hand prior to ceremony start time and the flag will be folded in a triangle shape.  7.57.5.  When NCOIC and Fold approach the pre-designated performance area, they separate in  a  column  formation  (NCOIC  walks  in  front  of  Fold).    Upon  arriving  to  their  pre-determined  positions,  in-between  the  audience  and  the  retiring  member,  they  will automatically halt.  7.57.6.  Once halted, NCOIC performs a three-count about face.  NCOIC begins to perform the “Half Dress” sequence (refer to paragraphs 9.36.1. and 9.38.1.).  7.57.7.  Fold  begins  to  unfold  the  flag.    See  AFPAM  34-1201,  Figure  A4.2  for  the  official flag folding script.  Figure A of this manual provides the honor guard’s cues for the flag fold while the script is being read.  236 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 7.57.8.  Once  the  flag  is  completely  unfolded,  both  members  secure  the  four  corners  of  the flag  and  bring  it  to  “table  top”  position  only.    Do  not  tilt  and  face  the  flag  towards  the audience or “pop” the flag open.  7.57.9.  When  the  flag  is  folded,  Fold  will  perform  a  “Full  Dress”  sequence  (refer  to paragraph 9.36.2.) and handoff the flag to the NCOIC.  7.57.10.  When the flag is secured to the NCOIC’s chest, both NCOIC and Fold will step off simultaneously.    Fold  will  exit  to  a  pre-determined  area  out  of  sight  from  the  ceremony.  NCOIC will proceed to the Retiree.  7.57.11.  To  present  the  flag  to  the  Retiree,  NCOIC  grasps  the  flag  with  the  right  hand, keeping  all  fingers  joined  and  pause.    Rotate  the  flag  in  a  clockwise  motion  with  the  right hand  while  simultaneously  lifting  the  flag  until  the  top  of  the  flag  is  at  eye  level.    The  left hand comes up and joins the right hand, ensuring the fingers are joined and remain together.  7.57.12.  The Retiree will take the flag from NCOIC, left hand over right.  NCOIC will recite a message to the Retiring individual, followed by a slow salute to the flag.  NCOIC will exit to a pre-determined area out of sight from the ceremony.  7.57.13.  The message is: (Rank and Name,) on behalf of our squadron [or other unit], your friends and your family, I present this flag in recognition of your [number] years of faithful service with the United States Air Force.  7.58.  Raising  and  Lowering  the  Flag.    Flag  raising  and  lowering,  and  Reveille  and  Retreat ceremonies will be performed IAW AFMAN 36-2203, Section 7C with the following exceptions.  These  exceptions  are  based  on  Air  Force  honor  guard  traditions  that  evolved  at  Bolling  AFB.  They  also  serve  to  provide  consistency  among  drills  and  ceremonies  performed  by  the  honor guard and to minimize the number of personnel required to perform these details.  7.58.1.  Personnel Required.  The same personnel are required for both raising and lowering the  flag.    One  NCOIC  and  two  Airmen  for  the  all-purpose  flag  and  One  NCOIC  and  five Airmen for the base flag.  The NCOIC will be an NCO.  7.58.2.  Equipment.  7.58.2.1.  White/black gloves.  7.58.2.2.  Ceremonial belts.  7.58.2.3.  All-purpose or base flag.  7.58.2.4.  The correct number of .38 caliber revolvers or M9 pistols, inert or operational (figure 8.2.).  7.58.3.  Uniform Requirements.  All Airmen should wear the ceremonial belt with a side arm in a black patent leather holster on the right side of the body.  If the detail does not possess enough side arms then only the NCOIC will be armed.  If it is required to wear Service Dress then  none  of  the  exceptions  or  guidance  listed  in  paragraph  9.41.  of  this  manual  shall  be followed.  7.58.4.  Drill  movements.   The detail  will use  Honor  Guard for all preparatory  commands and stand at ease for all positions of rest.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 237 7.58.5.  The  logistics  of  each  installation  will  determine  a  large  portion  of  how  the  retreat ceremony is  conducted.   While flexibility is  required,  great  attention must  be  given to  how the  National  flag  is  handled.    The  ultimate  result  of  the  ceremony  should  reflect  pride  and professionalism while providing the audience with a sense of patriotism.  238 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 8 FIRING PARTY  Section 8A—General Information 8.1.  Background.   The tradition of firing three rounds, or volleys, over graves can be traced to the European dynastic wars.  During this period armies had to halt fighting during certain points of the battle in order to remove the dead and wounded from the battle field.  After removing the casualties,  three  volleys  were  fired  into  the  air  to  signal  the  armies  to  resume  fighting.    This practice  continued  through  the  American  Civil  War.        Today,  the  firing  of  the  three  volleys makes up the “Military Honors” portion of a military funeral or memorial.  8.2.  Protocol.    The  firing  of  rifle  volleys  will  only  be  reserved  for  the  purpose  of  military funeral honors.  In addition, eligible members should only receive military honors one time.  Do not fire volleys at a memorial service if honors are to be rendered at a later time.  Refer to AFI 34-242  for  further  guidance.  NOTE:    The  firing  of  rifle  volleys  at  a  military  funeral/memorial service  is  not  to  be  confused  with  the  21-gun  salute  which  is  reserved  for  the  POTUS  and equivalent  heads  of  states.    A  firing  line  can  consist  of  any  number  of  riflemen  and  the  total number of rounds fired does not have to equal “21.”  Historically, prior to the First World War most firing lines at funerals consisted of eight riflemen and one commander.  8.3.  Requirements.  8.3.1.  Honor  guards  will  only  fire  volleys  during  military  funerals  and  memorials  (only when volleys will not be fired at a later time) and only once per individuals.  8.3.2.  Do  not  fire  volleys  for  competitions,  unveilings,  and  shows,  Pearl  Harbor Remembrance Day Ceremonies, Independence Day Ceremonies, POW/MIA ceremonies and any other events/ceremonies other than a military funeral/memorial.  8.3.3.  The  firing  of  volleys  will  never  be  referred  to  as  “the  3-volley  salute”  or  a  21-gun salute.  It is not a 21-gun salute or a salute of any kind.  8.3.4.  Firing parties will only, and always, fire three volleys in unison.  Never fire in ripple.  8.3.5.  Weapons safety and security comes first.  8.3.6.  Hearing protection while firing is mandatory.  8.3.7.  Family of the deceased may be provided expended rounds of ammunition  only upon request.  Spent casings/shells will not be tucked into the flag at any point during a funeral or any  ceremony.    The  flag  should  never  be  used  as  a  receptacle  for  receiving,  holding, carrying, or delivering anything according to United States Code, Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 8 (k).  8.4.  Composition and Formation.  8.4.1.  Firing  Line.    Honor  guard  firing  lines  will  consist  of  three  or  seven  individuals depending on the type of funeral.  8.4.2.  The firing line should be arranged from left to right, tallest to shortest, as viewed by the  deceased’s  next  of  kin  (NOK).    The  first  position  (known  as  point)  will  be  the  most AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 239 experienced  individual  that  can  keep  a  steady  cadence.    Do  not  base  the  assignment  of “point”  on  height  or  rank;  however  NFP  will  take  care  in  ensuring  that  the  team  is aesthetically pleasing. NOTE:  Less experienced members can be positioned in the firing line alongside individuals with steady cadences. (i.e. 1, 4 and 7 are the most experienced, 2 and 5 are the least experienced, and the other members fill in 3 and 6).  8.4.3.  Each firing line will have one NCOIC of firing party (NFP) who is in charge of and responsible for the team.  The NFP will be positioned three paces behind & centered on the firing line during military funerals.  Figure 8.1.  Three and Seven Person Firing Lines.   8.4.4.  Location.    Firing  party  is  positioned  diagonally  from  the  head  of  the  casket.    If circumstances do not allow the firing line to position diagonally from the head of the casket, the firing line may position “head on” or parallel to the casket. Always ensure the attending procession (NOK, family and guests) are able to see the entire firing line.  Never fire over the feet.  8.4.5.  Distances.   The firing line will be positioned at the following distances based on the type of funeral.  8.4.5.1.  All SHFs.  50-75 paces.  8.4.5.2.  FHFs in ANC.  75-100 paces. NOTE:  If using “crimped” ammunition the firing line will be posted 100-125 paces away for all SHFs and 125-150 paces away for a FHF in ANC.  8.5.  Responsibilities.  8.5.1.  Members.   Each member of the firing line is responsible for meeting and maintaining the  prescribed  standards  outlined  in  this  manual  and  all  applicable  standards  of  safety  and conduct.  8.5.1.1.  Members must maintain a high level of knowledge and proficiency.  8.5.2.  Point.   Establish the cadence and lead the team in the firing sequence using audio and visual signals.  8.5.2.1.  Take control and responsibility of the team when the NFP is unavailable.  240 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 8.5.3.  NFP.    Leads  the  firing  party  and  calls  all  the  commands  for  the  team.    The  NFP should be an NCO.  8.5.3.1.  Ensure  all  personnel  are  prepared  to  execute  pre-ceremony  (warm-up  and  dry-fire), inspection and ceremony procedures.  8.5.3.2.  Possess extensive knowledge of element procedures and the firing sequences.  8.5.3.3.  Ensure  the  best  possible  placement  of  the  firing  line  personnel  based  on experience and height factors.  8.5.3.4.  Obtain and safeguard the correct number of magazines and ammunition for the type of funeral being performed.  8.5.3.5.  Due to the uniform limitations, the NFP may carry loaded magazines for female firing line personnel from transportation drop off location to the predetermined firing line position.  8.5.3.6.  The  NFP  is  responsible  for  ensuring  all  expended  rounds  of  ammunition  are removed from the weapons before the weapons enter the fallout area.  The individual in charge  of  the  detail  must  also  ensure  all  weapons  are  clear  of  any  rounds  and/or magazines prior to transport.  8.5.3.7.  Ensure  blank  ammunition  and  expended  blank  ammunition  are  retrieved, accounted for, and turned in to the armory upon return from all details.  8.5.3.8.  In  the  event  of  long  distance  travel  requirements  when  there  is  an  extended period allocated for travel from base to the ceremony destination, the NFP will ensure all weapons are prepared for service and accounted for prior to departure.  8.5.3.9.  Will perform gravesite checks and attend post ceremony briefs.  8.6.  Equipment.  8.6.1.  Three Person Firing Line.  8.6.1.1.  Three  fully  operational  and  properly  maintained  M14  rifles  with  white/black slings.  8.6.1.2.  White/black gloves.  8.6.1.3.  The NFP draws nine rounds of ammunition for each ceremony along with three magazines.  8.6.1.4.  Hearing protection. Refer to paragraph 15.12. for additional guidance.  8.6.1.5.

The NFP draws twenty-one rounds of ammunition for each ceremony along with seven magazines.  8.6.2.4.  Hearing protection. Refer to paragraph 15.12. for additional guidance.  8.6.2.5.  One .38 caliber revolver or M9 pistol; inert or operational (figure 8.2.).  8.6.2.6.  One ceremonial belt.  Figure 8.2.  Proper Wear of the Sidearm in Holster.   8.7.  Weapons.   The M14 is the only authorized weapon to be used for firing parties. NOTE:  If a situation occurs that requires an honor guard to fire with a weapon other than the M14 contact the USAF Honor Guard Standardization & Evaluations section for approval and procedures.  8.7.1.  Weapons will never be fixed with bayonets.  8.7.2.  NFP will never carry a saber or sword.  8.7.3.  Weapons  Safety,  Security  and  Maintenance.    It  is  the  duty  of  all  firing  party members to adhere to all weapons safety and security procedures.  Every precaution feasible should  be  taken  to  ensure  this.    Refer  to  AFMANs  31-229,  Attachment  13,  and  91-201  for further guidance.  8.7.3.1.  When  operating  weapons,  all  personnel  must  treat  each  weapon  as  if  it  were loaded at all times.  Always point the weapon’s barrel in a safe direction.  The barrel will always be pointed either skyward (carry or port) or directly at the ground (inverted carry).  Never  point  the  weapon  at  people,  buildings,  vehicles,  etc.  Do  not  participate  in  or promote any form of horseplay with weapons.  8.7.3.2.  Do  not  handle  or  carry  loaded  weapons  indoors  or  while  onboard  vehicles.  Always  carry  loaded  weapons  in  the  port  arms  position.    You  will  never  march  in  to  a ceremony already loaded.  8.7.3.3.  All weapons will be cleaned after firing, prior to turning in.  8.7.3.4.  For cleaning procedures refer to the M14 Technical Manual (Department of the Army through https://www.mortuary.af.mil  Technical  Manual, TM 9-1005-223-20) available 242 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 8.7.4.  Loading Prior to Ceremony.  8.7.4.1.  Under the supervision of the NFP, the firing party locks and loads one magazine with three rounds into the weapons in the following manner:  (See Figure 8.3)  Figure 8.3.  Proper Loading of M1 Rifle   8.7.4.2.  The NFP pre-loads the magazines with three blank rounds in each.  8.7.4.3.  Position  the weapon so it is  facing away  from  other individuals with  the barrel pointing toward the ground.  8.7.4.4.  With the short angle of the magazine pointed down into the magazine well, press it  down  and  pull  it  toward  the  butt  of  the  weapon  until  it  locks.    There  will  be  a  loud, audible “click” sound.  NOTE:  When loading a  20 round magazine, the weapon’s sling will be routed on the Outside of the magazine, furthest from the operating rod handle.  8.7.4.5.  Once  loading  is  complete,  assume  the  position  of  attention.    This  will  let  the NFP know that you are ready to go.  8.7.4.6.  All loading is done outside.  8.7.4.7.  Always remove gloves prior to loading weapon to ensure gloves remain as clean as possible prior to the ceremony.  8.7.4.8.  Loaded  weapons  always  remain  outside  in  a  person's  possession  and  must  be carried at the position of port.  8.7.5.  Unloading After Ceremony.  8.7.5.1.  Pointing  the  weapon  at  the  ground  in  a  safe  direction  away  from  anyone  with gloves off, press the magazine release lever towards the barrel and lift the magazine out.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 243 8.7.5.2.  Take  the  knife-edge  of  the  left  hand  and  place  it  on  the  operating  rod  handle. While charging the weapon, simultaneously cover the chamber and grab the spent round. This will avoid the spent rounds falling on the ground.  8.7.5.3.  The NFP then visually checks the chamber of each weapon.  8.7.5.4.  The member will then close the chamber and pull the trigger while still aimed at ground.  8.7.5.5.  All unloading is done outside.  8.7.5.6.  Always remove gloves prior to unloading weapon.  Figure 8.4.  Unloading After Ceremony.   8.7.6.  Issue,  Clearing  and  Turn-in  Procedures.    Refer  to  AFMAN  31-229,  Attachment 13.  8.8.  Uniform Requirements.   The firing line will not wear the ceremonial belt.  The NFP will wear the belt with a side arm in a black patent leather holster on the right side of the body.  8.8.1.  Gloves may be removed only if they have no grip at all and the member is performing a dual role as pallbearer and firing party during a modified SHF (5, 7 or 10-person funeral).  If gloves are to be removed, then NFP will not wear gloves either.  8.8.2.  Only  flesh  colored,  transparent  or  blue  earplugs  will  be  worn.    All  members  in  the formation must wear the same style and color of earplugs.  8.9.  Commands.    All  commands  will  be  given  IAW  AFMAN  36-2203  and  the  instructions outlined in this manual.  8.9.1.  The  preparatory  command  of  Firing  Party  is  given  in  the  same  fashion  as  Honor Guard (paragraphs 1.12.3. and 2.2.2.5).  244 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Section 8B—Firing Party Rifle Manuals 8.10.

During the firing sequence the NFP will time the cadence of the command READY so that the volleys are approximately three to five seconds apart.  8.26.4.  Will  perform  stand  at  ease  IAW  paragraph  2.2.3.    The  NFP  will  never  go  to ceremonial at ease or parade rest.  8.26.  Dress Right Dress.   The command is Dress Right, DRESS.  The movement is the same as outlined in AFMAN 36-2203 with the following exceptions:  8.27.1.  Members will obtain an arm and a hands length interval.  8.27.2.  If the last person sees someone in the firing line not properly dressed, they will tell them to move forward or back and then call steady when they are in place with the rest of the line. The last person will give the NFP a slight head nod, then return to 45-degrees when the team is lined up and ready.  If time allows, the NFP also has the option of dressing the line IAW AFMAN 36-2203.    AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 261 Section 8D—Implementation 8.27.  Pre-ceremony Preparation.  8.27.1.  Members  will  report  45  minutes  prior  to  the  scheduled  fallout  time  for  the  day’s missions.    During  this  time  rifles  will  be  lubricated  (if  necessary),  inspected  and  the  pre-ceremony live-fire will take place.  8.27.2.  If conditions or resources do not permit a morning live-fire then the firing line will execute a pre-departure dry fire instead.  8.27.3.  NFP will inspect the  gravesite location 45  minutes prior to ceremony start time  (or when determined by OIC/NCOIC) and determine the positioning of the firing line.  8.27.4.  Once in position at gravesite, another dry fire will be accomplished. At least two run-throughs will be accomplished.  Figure 8.34.  Firing Party Performing Warm-ups Prior to the Ceremony.   8.27.5.  The firing line will be in position no later than 20 minutes prior to the arrival of the deceased’s  family  and  procession  and  will  assume  the  position  of  ceremonial  at  ease  when the procession is visible.  8.28.  March  to  Gravesite.    The  firing  line  will  fall  in  as  specified  by  the  NFP  then  march towards the pre-determined location.  Once the team is lined up with the lowering device, bier or table  (the  fourth  person  should  be  in  line  with  the  corner)  NFP  calls  Mark,  TIME;  then combines the necessary movements to position the team by giving the command  Firing  Party, Left (Right), Order, Dress Right, DRESS.  8.29.  Departure  and  Casings  Retrieval.    Upon  completion  of  the  ceremony  after  the  firing line  moves  to  port  arms,  the  fourth  person  will  execute  a  three-count  about  face  then  step  off halting one pace away from and directly in front of the NFP.  8.29.1.  (Count 1)  .  Bring the right hand up in front and extended around the left side of the hand guard.  262 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 8.35.

The weapon is at proper position of port for the NFP.  Figure 8.36.  Departure and Casings Retrieval (Count 2).   8.29.3.  The NFP reaches out and takes the weapon with both hands and assumes the position of port.  8.29.4.  The fourth person will take NFP’s command of Right (Left), FACE and Forward, MARCH.  8.29.5.  The  fourth  person  will  stay  behind  and  pick  up  the  casings.    Then  return  to  the vehicle(s).  NOTES: 1. Remove gloves prior to picking up casings. 2. Only when asked will the member stop and give a max of three spent rounds to the family.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 263 Chapter 9 PALLBEARERS  Section 9A—General Information 9.1.  Background.   The pallbearer is a necessary component of any funeral and its origins are as old  as antiquity.  The word “pall” originates from  the  Latin word “pallium.”  A pallium was  a piece of cloth wrapped around the body of ancient Greeks and Romans as an outer garment. Pall, in itself has now come to mean a couple things.  The most common and simplest definition is a cloth  used  to  cover  a  casket,  bier  or  tomb.    While  some  traditions  and  organizations  use  the terms pallbearer, casket bearer and body bearer to differentiate between the roles one may play during  the  escort  of  the  deceased,  for  the  Air  Force  the  terms  pallbearer  and  body  bearer  are synonymous.  Furthermore, the term “honorary pallbearers” refers to individuals who move the casket using a  church truck (gurney),  cot  or carriage and do not  actual lift/carry the casket.   In addition, individuals selected to follow behind the casket are honorary pallbearers.  There is no limit to the number of honorary pallbearers.  9.1.1.  Many  of  the  traditions  and  rituals  witnessed  during  a  military  funeral  can  trace  its origins  to  the  American  Civil  War.    Many  believe  that  the  tradition  of  covering  the  casket with a flag occurred during this time when caskets were not available on the battlefield.  The flag was wrapped around the soldier’s body forming a makeshift  pall in  which he could  be buried.  In addition, the use of the caisson in ANC also finds its beginnings on the battlefield.  During  the  war  the  horse-drawn  caissons  that  pulled  artillery  pieces  also  doubled  as  a conveyance to clear fallen soldiers from the battlefield.  9.2.  Protocol.   Refer to Title 36, United States Code Chapter 10, AFI 34-1201 and AFPAM 34-1202  regarding  proper  flag  handling  etiquette  and  protocol.    Refer  to  AFI  34-242  for  military funeral honors eligibility.  9.2.1.  USAF  and  Base  Honor  Guard  Pallbearers  will  only  be  utilized  in  funerals  for  Air Force retirees, Active Duty deaths, repatriations, Medal of Honor recipients or as directed by MDW for Special Military, Official and State Funerals.  They may be utilized for all funeral types in ANC.  9.2.2.  Honor  guards  may  also  be  tasked  to  perform  Dignified  Arrivals  and  Dignified Transfers.  Dignified Arrivals and Transfers are used to move remains from an aircraft to a hearse  or  other  mode  of  transportation.    Both  follow,  essentially,  the  same  sequence  and procedures.    Refer  to  AFPAM  34-504  for  information  regarding  the  escort  of  deceased Airmen.  9.2.2.1.  Dignified  Arrivals.    These  are  performed  for  all  Airmen  who  are  entitled  to mortuary services.  A Dignified Arrival is performed only at the final destination airport when the remains have been transported by aircraft.  Do not perform at any other time.  9.2.2.2.  Dignified  Transfers.  These are only performed by the  USAF Honor Guard  for Active  Duty  deaths  arriving  at  Dover  or  Andrews  AFB  through  Port  Mortuary  from OCONUS.  Do not perform at any other time.  Installation honor guards do not perform Dignified Transfers.  264 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.1.  Dignified Arrival and Dignified Transfer.   9.2.3.  See paragraph 8.3.7 regarding use of the flag to carry spent casings at a funeral.  9.2.4.  Saluting the Flag.  AFI 34-2101, AFPAM 34-1202 and AFMAN 36-2203 all provide guidance  on  when  to  salute  the  U.S.  flag.    Airmen  must  also  adhere  to  the  following guidance, clarification and exceptions:  9.2.4.1.  When marching past a flag draped casket, or if the flag draped casket is passing the individual, a salute is required.  These rules apply when the casket is in the hearse as well.  Flags draped on caskets are not considered “cased.”  9.2.4.2.  A  cased/folded  flag  is  saluted  following  the  same  rules  as  stated  in  (paragraph 9.2.2.1.)  when  it  is  accompanied  with  the  remains  of  a  service  member  prior  to  and during a military funeral whether inside or outside of a vehicle.  flags  are  also the 9.2.4.3.  Cased fold  and inspection/simulated  inspection  of  the  flag.    The  third  and  last  exception  for  saluting cased flags is when the flag is presented to an individual for the final time (at a military funeral or retirement) and will never be un-cased/un-folded again.  saluted  upon  completion  of 9.2.5.  The only two occasions that the U.S. Flag is not aloft, free and traveling blue field first are  during  a  military  funeral  when  the  flag  is  used  as  a  pall.    During  the  transportation  of remains the flag will travel stripes first and during the committal service the flag may be held parallel to the ground.  9.2.6.  Message of Condolence:  “On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States  Air  Force,  and  a  grateful  Nation,  please  accept  this  flag  as  a  symbol  of  our appreciation for your loved one’s honorable and faithful service.”  9.2.7.  PC  bearer.    The  PC  bearer  will  follow  directly  behind  the  remains  (in  front  of OIC/NCOIC) on the march to gravesite.  9.3.  Requirements.  9.3.1.  The casket will always be carried parallel to the ground and level.  9.3.2.  The casket will always travel feet first.  EXCEPTIONS: 1. Obstruction in the path of travel or an adverse condition that prohibits the team from carrying feet first. 2. The funeral for a Military Chaplain.  In this instance, it is customary that when carried into or out of the chapel, that their casket travel head-end first.  Their remains will be transported to gravesite AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 265 in the normal, “feet first” manner. 3. When the casket is secured in a fixed wing aircraft for transportation.  The casket will be positioned with the head towards the nose of the aircraft and  travel  this  way  for  the  duration  of  the  flight,  from  take-off  till  landing.  4.  During  the transfer of a casket from the hearse and onto a caisson.  9.3.3.  When saluting while marching, both the individual rendering the salute and the bearer marching beside them will suspend arm swing.  9.3.4.  When in formation the pallbearer closest to the individual, flag or remains will render the hand salute.  All other team members will remain at attention.  9.3.5.  OIC/NCOIC  will  only  “heel  click”  when  performing  movements  with  the  bearers team.  They will never heel click when executing movements as a solitary member or with a Chaplain.  9.3.6.  The  lowering  of  the  OIC/NCOIC’s  hand  salute  signals  the  hearse  and/or  caisson  to stop.  9.3.7.  OIC/NCOIC will only move to inspect the casket/hearse if it is absolutely necessary.  The  NPB  should  be  experienced  enough  to  handle  any  situation  regarding  the  transfer  or carry of remains.  9.3.8.  OIC/NCOIC  will  only  turn  their  head  to  look  for  the  funeral  director  or  ceremony representative if it is absolutely necessary.  9.3.9.  OIC/NCOIC  will  execute  all  movements  in  the  same  manner  as  the  pallbearer  team and as outlined in this chapter.  9.4.  Composition  and  Formation.    Air  Force  pallbearer  teams  will  consist  of  six  members.  Ensure  the  height  of  the  team  is  as  closely  matched  as  possible.    Teams  with  drastic  height differences place members safety in jeopardy as carrying heavier caskets may be more difficult as the shorter and/or taller individuals may be placed in  a less than optimum carrying position. EXCEPTION:    The  USAF  Honor  Guard  will  utilize  eight  pallbearers  for  all  funerals,  unless dictated  otherwise,  with  casketed  remains  in  ANC.    Base  Honor  Guards  may  utilize  eight pallbearers only when manning allows it and only during SHFs.  Never use eight pallbearers for a modified SHF (7-person), or Dignified Arrivals.  9.4.1.  Each  pallbearer  team  will  have  an  NCOIC  of  Pallbearers  (NPB)  who  is  the  most experienced  team  member.    The  second  most  experienced  member  will  fill  the  position  of Handoff.  9.4.2.  Prior  to  the  ceremony  the  team  will  always  be  positioned  facing  the  gravesite approximately 10 paces from the OIC/NCOIC.  For FHFs in ANC, the team will always be facing the formation at  the transfer point.  For  Minimum  Honors  Funerals  the team  will be positioned with their backs to the gravesite.  9.4.3.  The  team  will  be  aligned  three  (four)  abreast  for  a  six  (eight)  person  team  in  two columns  relative  to  NPB’s  position.   NPB  will  be  positioned  so  that  they  are  closest  to  the hearse when it is stopped.  When facing the back of the hearse, the NPB will always be in the front right.  266 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.4.4.  The OIC/NCOIC  will pre-post approximately where the Caisson must stop  (adjacent to the pallbearer team) with their back to the gravesite.  OIC/NCOIC will be at the position of stand at ease.  9.4.5.  At gravesite the OIC/NCOIC will be positioned at the foot end of the grave one to two paces away from the pallbearer team.  9.5.  Responsibilities.  9.5.1.  Members.    All  pallbearers  must  be  strong  enough  to  carry  their  share  of  weight  on the  casket  and  support  their  teammates.    All  members  will  be  thoroughly  familiar  with  all positions  on  the  team  and  must  possess  the  ability  to  perform  as  Fold,  Mark,  Dead  Mark, Cross-mark,  Dead  Cross-mark,  Carry  or  Handoff  if  required  to.    Each  team  member’s responsibilities  vary  throughout  each  sequence  and  type  of  ceremony.    Carry  and  Handoff should be the strongest  members on the team.  7-person funeral:  Fold  will also perform  as Bugler.  Handoff, Carry and Mark will perform as the firing party.  Cross-mark will perform as spare/traffic.  9.5.2.  Handoff.    Is  the  second  most  experience  person  on  the  team  and  is  responsible  for taking  control  and  responsibility  of  the  team  when  NPB  is  unavailable  or  the  situation dictates it.  9.5.3.  NPB.    The  most  experienced  person  on  the  team  and  is  responsible  for  the accountability,  conduct,  safety,  position  assignments  and  performance  of  the  pallbearers under his/her direction.  NPB will be accountable to the OIC/NCOIC of the ceremony for all actions of their team.  During a 7-person funeral the NPB has the dual role of NCOIC.  The NPB should be an NCO.  9.5.3.1.  Ensure  all  personnel  are  prepared  to  execute  pre-ceremony  (warm-ups), inspection and ceremony procedures.  9.5.3.2.  Possess  extensive  knowledge  of  element  procedures  and  the  pallbearer sequences.  9.5.3.3.  In  most  cases  will  insure  the  casket  is  in  the  hearse  properly,  flag  is  draped properly,  etc.    If  anything  needs  to  be  fixed,  ask  the  driver  of  the  hearse  or  the  funeral director to make adjustments as needed.  9.5.3.4.  Will perform gravesite checks and attend post ceremony briefs.  9.5.4.  OIC/NCOIC.    Should  be  the  ranking  individual  on  the  funeral  and  has  overall responsibility of the entire ceremony.  The OIC/NCOIC will be an Officer or NCO.  9.5.4.1.  They will have knowledge on all elements and sequences.  9.5.4.2.  In certain situations, may need to insure the casket is in the hearse properly, flag is draped properly, etc.  If anything needs to be fixed, ask the driver of the hearse or the funeral director to make adjustments as needed.  9.5.4.3.  Will present the flag and deliver the message of condolence to the Next of Kin (NOK) in the absence of a military chaplain.  9.5.4.4.  Responsible for coordinating gravesite checks and post ceremony briefs.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 267 9.6.  Equipment.  9.6.1.  Practice internment flag.  9.6.2.  White/black non-siliconed gloves.  9.6.3.  Safety back-belts (recommended).  9.7.  Uniform  Requirements.    The  pallbearer  team  will  not  wear  the  ceremonial  belt.    Safety belts,  if  used,  will  be  worn  underneath  outer  garments  to  aid  in  the  support  of  the  back  and abdominal region while carrying caskets.  9.7.1.  Never wear siliconed gloves while folding the flag.  9.7.2.  If  the  team  transports  remains  from  indoors  to  outdoors,  as  it  may  for  funerals  that include a chapel service, then the team should not remove their hats.  If the entire service is indoors, then hats will not be worn.  Do not develop a sequence to remove/put on hats in a ceremonial fashion.  9.7.3.  When performing a two-person flag fold during individual retirement ceremonies, or any  flag  fold  outside  of  a  military  funeral,  the  ceremonial  uniform  must  not  be  worn.  Members will wear the Service Dress uniform.  9.8.  Commands.    Pallbearers and OIC/NCOIC will call all commands from the same position as  the  rest  of  the  team  (Chaplain)  and  will  execute  the  movement  on  their  own  command  of execution.  9.8.1.  The  command  STEP  is  used  in  lieu  of  Forward,  MARCH  and  is  used,  in  many cases, to command the team to perform a rehearsed sequence of movements.  This is due to the  unique  requirements  placed  on  the  team  to  enable  the  pallbearers  to  perform  the ceremony.    For  example,  when  pallbearers  are  required  to  step  to  the  side,  one  file  must perform a right step while the other performs a left.  Attempting to give the command Right (Left)  Step,  MARCH  would  not  be  feasible.    So  for  consistency  and  ceremonial  purposes the  commands  Forward,  MARCH,  Right  (Left  Step,  MARCH  and  …Steps  Backward, MARCH are not used.  9.8.2.  At  all  other  times,  pallbearers  will  follow  the  guidance  dictated  in  Chapter  2  of AFMAN 36-2203.  9.8.3.  All commands given by the OIC/NCOIC are subdued, except for SECURE.  Section 9B—Pallbearer Manuals 9.9.  General.   Pallbearers perform the following drill movements and all IAW Chapter 2 of this manual:  attention (paragraph 2.14.), stand at ease (paragraph 2.2.3.), present/order (paragraph 2.4.),  halt  (paragraph  2.5.2.)  and  mark  time  (paragraph  2.6).    Right  (left)  face  will  always  be completed  in  a  three  second  cadence.    All  hand  salutes  performed  during  pallbearer  sequences will be done so in a three second cadence.  9.10.  Hang Step.   Hang steps are executed after the command of STEP or as a solitary member during  some  situations  (i.e.  as  Handoff  when  positioning  to  remove  a  casket  from  a  hearse). Arms will be suspended but not pinned to side. Sharply place the left foot in front of the right, letting it “hang” approximately 1-2” off the ground. After the pause, glide forward keeping the 268 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 elevated foot level and parallel to the ground, placing the heel in about the same spot the toe was.  Sharply place the right foot directly in front of the left, letting it “hang” slightly off the ground. Repeat as necessary until given the command is given to flank right or left.  Figure 9.2.  Hang Step.   9.10.1.  Flanking Movement.   Flanking movements are executed while hang steps in order to  position  the  team  directly  behind  the  hearse.    The  command  is  Right  (Left)  Flank, MARCH.  The preparatory command Right (Left) will be given on the right (left) foot.  On the  next  available  step,  the  command  Flank  will  be  given.    The  command  of  execution MARCH is called on the same foot as the preparatory command.  These commands should be  called  once  the  foot  strikes  the  ground.    Immediately  after  MARCH  execute  the  flank IAW paragraph 2.7.2 of this manual.  9.10.2.  Guide  Steps.    When  guide  steps  are  needed  NPB  and  Fold  will  initiate  the  first guide step followed by the second set of four team members on the second step  (two for six man  team)  and  ending  with  the  final  two  team  members  guiding  on  the  third  step  so  the entire team is dressed and covered to the vehicle.  Figure 9.3.  Flanking Movement.  9.11.  Head  Drops.    A  “head  drop”  describes  the  three  second  lowering  of  the  head  to  a  45-degree angle looking down.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 269 Figure 9.4.  Head Drops.  Section 9C—Carrying Interred (Casketed) Remains  9.12.  Basics.    Hand  positions,  posture,  and  footing  are  important  to  properly  carry  the  casket.  NPB’s side (Mark, Dead Mark & Carry) will carry the casket with their left palm facing down on the  carrying  handle  and  right  palm  facing  up.    Fold’s  side  (Cross-mark,  Dead  Cross-mark  and Handoff)  carries  the  casket  with  their  right  palm  facing  down  on  the  carrying  handle  and  left palm  facing  up.    During  an  8-person  carry,  NPB  may  give  the  subdued  command  of  Ready, FLARE to signal Fold to release the casket with their forward hand and flare that hand in front of the flag and casket.  NPB will do the same.  This technique is only used during an 8-person carry when the casket is light in weight  (i.e. during repatriations), and/or the casket is not long enough to allow all members to correctly position their hands on the casket handles.  Figure 9.5.  Hand Positions  9.12.1.  The  proper  posture  while  carrying  caskets  is  body  straight  up  and  down,  shoulders rolled  back,  and  head  and  eyes  straightforward.    When  walking  behind  one  another,  walk with your toes pointed outwards (duck walk) making sure as to not swing the casket from one side to another. Do not let the casket rest on the hip or side of the body.   270 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.12.2.  The OIC/NCOIC will follow behind and centered on the team, approximately four to six paces, with suspended arm swing.  Stay in step with the pallbearers.  Figure 9.6.  Pallbearer Teams Carrying Repatriated Remains.  9.13.  Turning Steps.   Turning steps are executed after the remains are removed from the hearse or the caisson.  The initial number designates the number of side steps the team will take away from the hearse.  Discretion for this number is NPB’s alone and is based on the distance of the hearse from the route to gravesite.  (This number will be no less than 3, no greater than 10).  The next  number  of  steps  in  the  sequence  will  always  be  5.    The  direction  of  the  turn  will  be determined by the location of gravesite from the pallbearers’ position.  If the gravesite is located behind  NPB  the  turn  will  be  toward  Handoff  (clock-wise).    Alternately,  if  gravesite  is  located behind Fold, the turn will be toward Carry (counter clock-wise).  Example: “5 and 5 to Handoff”.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 271 Figure 9.7.  Turning Steps   9.13.1.  The command for the behind the hearse sequence is given by NPB to Handoff loud enough only for them to hear.  Handoff will repeat the command to each member of the team as they remove the casket from the hearse.  9.13.2.  During  the  caisson  sequence,  the  number  of  steps  away  from  the  caisson  will  be determined by the stopping point of the caisson relative to the pre-determined route of travel for the casket to gravesite.  NPB will command HALT and DOWN once the team is aligned with the path.  The next command will be STEP, which will initiate the five turning steps.  9.13.3.  The OIC/NCOIC will salute once the remains are in motion (on Handoff’s first step backwards to remove the casket).  They will hold the salute until the team has completed the turning  steps.    At  this  point  the  will  face  the  team  and  salute.    Once  the  casket  passes, OIC/NCOIC will lower their salute and follow the team.  9.14.  Centering in on the Casket.   On the command of CENTER, the members on each side of the casket face each other.  When performing the facing movement create a “T” similar to a two-count about face rather than a proper right (left) face.  This will enable the team to maintain the  proper  distance  from  the  casket  and  reposition  comfortably  without  injury  or  excess  casket movement.  Then the NPB side flips their left hand over so that their palms are facing up.  While Fold’s  side  is  doing  the  same  thing  with  their  right  hands  (this  is  a  3-second  simultaneous movement).    All  members  execute  a  three-second  synchronized  head  drop  after  the  hand-flip.  Members’ eyesight should be focused on the “crown” (top) of the casket.  272 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.8.  Centering in on the Casket.  9.15.  Stepping onto a Lowering Device on Raised Platform.   With the team halted one pace away  from  the  lowering  device  and  centered  in  on  the  casket,  NPB  will  call  Ready,  UP.    The pallbearers  lift  the  casket  at  a  three  second  cadence,  stopping  once  the  casket  handles  are approximately at eye level.   Figure 9.9.  Ready-Up.   9.15.1.  In order to keep the casket safely balanced, each pallbearer shall lift the casket using their  upper-body  muscle  groups  only.  Typically,  without  rocking  back/forth  and  without squatting or bending the knees. This accomplished by rolling the back of the forearms against the  base  of  the  casket,  gently  pushing  against  it  and  lifting  the  casket  straight  up.  As  the casket rises up so should the heads of the team members until they are looking straight ahead at  the handles. CAUTION:  Do not  lean in  toward the casket  when lifting it up.  This  may off-balance the casket and other pallbearers, and risks injury.  9.15.2.  NPB will pause for a dead count ensuring all the pallbearers are set, and then he/she calls STEP.  The team begins side stepping onto the raised platforms.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 273 Figure 9.10.  Stepping onto a Lowering Device on Raised Platform (Ready, UP; STEP).   9.15.3.  When  stepping  on  to  a  raised  platform  every  member  of  the  teams’  head  will  be looking  straight  forward  at  the  casket  only  their  eyes  will  be  looking  down  at  the  person’s feet across from them watching to see that they are ready to step up onto the raised platform. When a member hits his foot on the side of the ladder supports they are signaling that they are ready to step up, on the next step both members will step up simultaneously.  9.15.4.  If the “Ready, Up” is not possible due to low overhead clearance such as a tree, tent, awning etc, or the pallbearers are not strong enough, then after the team centers on the casket NPB  will  call  STEP.    The  team  will  side  step  until  their  foot  hits  the  side  of  the  ladder support.  When this happens and the member is ready to step up onto the platforms, they will leave their head up and make eye contact with the person across from them.  As soon as the two members step onto the platforms they will lower their head back down.  274 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.11.  Stepping onto a Lowering Device on Raised Platform (STEP).   9.15.5.  When the entire team is on the platforms and the casket is centered on the lowering device, NPB commands HALT then DOWN.  9.15.6.  OIC/NCOIC Procedures.  As the bearers approach the gravesite, OIC/NCOIC breaks off from the team and takes the position at the foot end of the grave.  The OIC/NCOIC will render a salute while the casket is placed on the bier or lowering device.  Once the casket is down on the bier or lowering device, the salute is lowered.  9.15.7.  If the casket was carried to the grave site head first (“Up and Face” was performed; paragraph 9.23.), then the OIC/NCOIC will halt with the pallbearer team and render a salute.  Hold the salute until the remains have been placed at gravesite, then lower salute and move the appropriate number of steps forward to the foot of the grave.  9.16.  Lowering  the  Casket.    The  command  is  DOWN.    There  are  five  different  situations where this command applies.  9.16.1.  Placing the casket onto a church truck for transportation inside a chapel or to another location. (3 second cadence).  9.16.1.1.  When the casket has been placed on the church truck, all hands flare downward towards  the  casket  (left  middle  fingertip  over  the  right,  thumbs  crossed).    Mark  and Cross-mark  initiate  a  slow  rise  up  from  the  casket  handles,  all  pallbearers  keep  their heads down.  NPB gives the subdued command Ready, CUT and each pallbearer comes to  attention  by  raising  their  heads  (looking  straight  ahead),  pinning  their  hands  to  their sides and take one step back away from the casket beginning with the foot closest to the entrance (NPB’s side with the left foot and Fold’s side with the right foot).  If the casket was  transported  head  first  then  this  is  reversed  (Handoff’s  side  with  the  left  foot  and Carry’s side with the right foot).  9.16.2.  Lowering the casket after removal from the caisson during FHFs in ANC (3 second cadence).  When lowering the casket from this position all heads will follow the casket down and will terminate at a 45-degree angle looking down.  9.16.3.  Lowering the casket after it has cleared a tombstone. (3 second cadence).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 275 9.16.4.  Lowering the casket onto the lowering device at gravesite. (8 second cadence).  9.16.4.1.  When  the  casket  is  lowered  at  the  gravesite  NPB  and  Handoff  release  the casket with their right hands and lift the flag out away from the casket.  Fold and Carry release the casket with their left hands and lift the flag out away from the casket.  9.16.4.2.  If  there  is  no  flag  on  the  casket  (for  example  during  a  Dependent  Funeral  at ANC),  all  pallbearers’  hands  will  flare  downward  towards  the  casket  (left  middle fingertip  over  the  right,  thumbs  crossed).    Mark  and  Cross-mark  initiate  a  slow  rise  up from the casket handles, all pallbearers keep their heads down.  NPB commands, Ready, CUT  and  each  pallbearer  comes  to  attention  by  raising  their  heads  (looking  straight ahead) and pinning their hands to their sides.  Figure 9.12.  Lowering the Casket.   9.17.  Facing to March with the Casket.   NPB gives the command FACE for all members of the team to face toward NPB when holding the casket in the “Center” position with heads up and completed in unison at a three second cadence.  9.17.1.  NPB’s side will turn their right foot followed by the left toward the right.  9.17.2.  Fold’s side will turn their left foot, followed by the right to the left.  9.17.3.  When performing the facing movement, if necessary, create a “T” similar to a two-count about face rather than a proper right (left) face.  This will enable the team to maintain the  proper  distance  from  the  casket  and  reposition  comfortably  without  injury  or  excess casket movement.  276 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.13.  Facing to March with the Casket  9.18.  Halting  the  Team.    This  command is  drawn out  (i.e.  H-A-A-A-ALT) and given on the right  or  left  heel,  halfway  through  the  stride.    The  entire  team  halts  closing  the  trailing  foot beside the lead foot.  There are no heel clicks (two-count movement).   Figure 9.14.  Halting the Team.   9.19.  Up.    The command UP is used to raise the heads of the pallbearers whenever necessary.  Heads will be raised in  the same manner they are lowered, using a three  second cadence.  The termination  point  is  once  eye  contact  is  made  with  the  individual  across  the  casket.    Heads should never be raised to the point that chins/noses are pointed up.  9.20.    Right/Left  Wheel.      Used  to  turn  the  team  either  right  or  left.    NPB  initiates  this movement by slightly tugging on the casket.  The team will start the wheel by marking time and guiding/turning in the direction of the hearse/caisson/lowering device.  While marking time, the team  will  raise  their  outside  knee  higher  than  their  inside  leg.  Once  aligned  in  the  desired direction of travel, Handoff (if turning left) or Carry (if turning right) will command STEP on the left foot. When this command is given, the team will take one more mark time step with the right foot then resume marching on the left foot.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 277 Figure 9.15.  Right/Left Wheel.  9.21.  Clearing Obstacles.    The command Ready, UP is used when transporting a casket over tombstones.  The command is given on sequential left feet.  The preparatory command Ready is given on the left foot; dead-step with the right foot and UP is called on the next left foot.  The entire team lifts the casket up to a termination point slightly lower than shoulder level or as high as necessary to clear the obstacle.  The casket shall remain level at this height until Handoff says CLEAR. The command DOWN is given by NPB.   Figure 9.16.  Clearing Obstacles (Ready, Up).  9.21.1.  For rare  and extreme situations where the team  cannot  clear the obstacle then NPB may  give  the  command  Ready,  SHOULDER.    This  is  performed  in  the  same  manner  as  278 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Ready,  UP  except  upon  completion  of  the  movement  the  team  will  flip  their  rear  hand (NPB’s side will change grip with the left hand and Fold’s side of the casket will change grip with  the  right  hand)  so  the  palm  is  facing  away  from  the  casket.    After  changing  grip  the team  is  then  able  to  lift  the  casket  above  the  shoulder  if  needed.  NOTE:    Only  use  this movement  as  a last  resort after all other  alternatives have been  exhausted.  CAUTION:  Do not perform this movement if the team is not strong enough or has not been given adequate training and instruction to execute.  Figure 9.17.  Clearing Obstacles (Ready, SHOULDER).   9.22.  Casket  Corrections  and  Control.    Communication  during  the  carry  is  essential  to  a smooth  and  level  carry.    Pallbearers  may  give  the  following  corrections  during  the  carry  to ensure  the  casket  is  level:  FOLD  SIDE  UP/DOWN,  NPB  SIDE  UP  DOWN,  FRONT UP/DOWN.  Give corrections only loud enough for the pallbearers to hear.  9.22.1.  Pallbearers  may  state  quietly  Step,  It,  OUT  to  instruct  the  team  to  increase  the cadence of the march in order to reach the gravesite quicker due to the weight of the casket or distance to the lowering device or bier.  9.22.2.  Handoff or Carry may give a subdued command Ready, FLARE to reposition their “rear” hands to the bottom of the casket to grant them more leverage and increase control on a heavy casket.  9.22.3.  When carrying upstairs or to step onto a curb, the pallbearers on NPB’s side of the casket  will  state  which  foot  they  will  step  up  with  prior  to  reaching  the  first  step.    For example, NPB calls  LEFT as the right  foot hits the  ground and on the  next  step (left foot) NPB and Fold step up on the left foot. Mark and Carry will do the same and the commands will basically ripple to the rear on every other step.  9.23.  Carrying the Casket Head First.   See paragraph 9.3.2. and its exceptions.  9.23.1.  NPB  will  determine  when  the  scenario  calls  for  the  use  of  this  option.    NPB  shall inform the team prior to the start of the ceremony if this technique will be employed.  9.23.2.  While Handoff is in position at the rear bumper of the hearse to remove the casket; NPB  will  direct  “up  and  face”  instead  of  the  numbers  for  turning  steps.    Pallbearers  must ensure  their  hands  are  positioned  correctly  (thumbs  towards  Handoff)  Refer  to  paragraph 9.24. for instructions on transferring the casket to a caisson.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 279 9.23.3.  After  Handoff  has  commanded  READY  (refer  to  paragraph  9.24.  for  hearse unloading), NPB will command UP.  When the team has executed their 3-second head raises, NPB calls FACE.  Handoff will take over as the team leader and call STEP.  From this point forward Handoff will call all the necessary commands for the team.  9.23.4.  Once  the  team  is  has  halted,  and  the  casket  is  in  position  to  be  lowered,  NPB  will take over as team  leader and  command  DOWN.   At this point, NPB is in  command of the team for the duration of the ceremony.  9.24.  Hearse Unloading/Loading.   The following sequences and techniques are used to unload and load a casket from and into the hearse.  9.24.1.  Behind  the  Hearse  (Casket  Removal).    The  team  marches  up  to  the  back  of  the hearse with NPB in the front right of the team.  NPB commands Mark, TIME and allows 4-6 steps for the team to dress, followed by Bearers, HALT.  The team halts and NPB’s side executes a left  face and  then takes one  right  step toward the hearse.  Fold, Cross-mark and Dead Cross-mark execute a right face and then take one left step.  Handoff will pause for one count as team faces toward each other and as the team steps toward the hearse; Handoff takes one right step and centers between each file. After steps are complete the entire team (except for  Handoff)  makes  eye  contact  with  the  person  across  from  them  (creating  a  one  second pause) and executes a three-second head drop.  Figure 9.18.  Behind the Hearse (Casket Removal).   280 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.19.  3-Second Head Drops.  9.24.1.1.  After the team has completed their three second head drops, Handoff takes two (6-person  team)  or  three  (8-person  team)  hang  steps  to  the  back  bumper  of  the  hearse. Handoff then executes a three second head drop.   Figure 9.20.  Handoff Hang Steps.  9.24.1.2.  If  necessary,  Handoff  will  undress  the  flag  over  the  casket.    The  following counts are executed with a three second cadence.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 281 9.24.1.3.  (Count  1)  .    Handoff  will  bring  their  hands  up  in  a  fist,  as  if  at  attention,  in front of their shoulders (palms inward).  Figure 9.21.  Handoff Undresses Flag (Count 1).   9.24.1.4.  (Count  2)  .    Extend  arms/hands  out  straight  over  the  casket.    Hands  will  be flared over the casket, index fingers touching; thumbs will be under their index fingers so index fingers can be grounded to each other.  Figure 9.22.  Handoff Undresses Flag (Count 2).  9.24.1.5.  (Count 3)  .  Slide hands apart along the white band. Keep both hands flared.   282 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.23.  Handoff Undresses Flag (Count 3).   9.24.1.6.  (Count  4)  .    Grab  the  flag  and  pull  it  over  the  end  of  the  casket.    Handoff secures the casket handle with both hands (palms facing up).  Figure 9.24.  Handoff Undresses Flag (Count 4).   9.24.1.7.  Once Handoff is in position to remove the casket from the hearse, the NPB will quietly  give  the  number  of  turning  steps  or  UP  and  FACE  (paragraph  9.23.),  if necessary.  Handoff will repeat this number to NPB for verification, twice.  Handoff will step back with their left foot with the casket in tow.  Handoff’s head rises up on the first step  of  pulling  the  casket  out  of  the  hearse.    Next  NPB  will  command  Ready,  TAKE; Fold  and  NPB  will  take  hold  of  the  casket  with  palms/thumbs  in  the  correct  direction (paragraph 9.12.).  Handoff must repeat the number of turning steps twice more for the AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 283 rest  of  the  team  before  returning  to  their  designated  position  on  the  casket.    All pallbearers must have their thumbs pointing in the direction of travel with the casket.  Figure 9.25.  Hearse Unloading (Ready, TAKE).   9.24.1.8.  When the casket is  approximately  2/3  of the way out  of the hearse  NPB  will, give the subdued command, Ready, LIFT.  NPB and Fold will gently raise the casket to prevent it from the striking the hearse’s rear bumper.  9.24.1.9.  If  the  front  of  the  flag  is  not  draped  over  the  front  of  the  casket,  NPB  must quietly  command,  Ready,  FLARE.    Upon  the  command,  NPB  and  Fold  will simultaneously  bring  their  right  and  left  hands,  respectively,  over  the  front  end  of  the casket to the top, take hold of the end of the flag and drape it over the end of the casket.  Once  the  motion  is  complete  NPB  and  Fold  will  re-place  their  hands  on  the  casket handle.  284 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.26.  Hearse Unloading (Ready, FLARE).   9.24.1.10.  Once  the  casket  is  out  of  the  hearse,  Handoff  should  ensure  that  the  rear handle of the casket, if applicable is pushed down, and then return to their proper position on the casket.  9.24.1.11.  To return to position Handoff will take two side steps.  The first step will be a 45-degree step facing the left rear corner of the casket. If the weight of the casket and the strength of the team allow it, Handoff may release the handle with both hands and return to the position of attention.  After releasing the handle bring both hands up in the same manner as paragraph 9.23.1.10. then in the same three second cadence return both arms to the side at attention.  Figure 9.27.  Hearse Unloading (Handoff Repositions).  9.24.1.12.  Once  in  position  Handoff  will  execute  a  three  second  head  drop  and  call READY.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 285 Figure 9.28.  Hearse Unloading (READY).   9.24.2.  Hearse Loading.   There will be situations when it is necessary to re-load the casket into the hearse.  Pallbearers will transport the casket to the back door of the hearse.  NPB will command  HALT  followed  by  CENTER  approximately  one  pace  away  from  the  rear bumper.  9.24.2.1.  If the front of the flag is draped over the front of the casket, NPB must quietly command  Ready,  FLARE.    Upon  the  command,  NPB  and  Fold  will  simultaneously bring their right and left hands, respectively, off the handles to the front end of the casket, take hold of their respective corners of the flag material and drape it over the top of the casket.    Once  complete,  NPB  and  Fold  will  simultaneously,  re-place  their  hands  on  the casket handles.  9.24.2.2.  After  the  team  has  centered  in  on  the  casket  and  heads  are  lowered;  Handoff will  release  the  casket  (if  weight  of  casket  and  strength  of  team  allow  it)  and  take  two side steps to the right (the first step will be a 45-degree step facing the left rear corner of the casket, the next step will be directly behind the casket).  9.24.2.3.  Handoff takes hold of the rear casket handle, palms up (if no handle is present, hold  the  casket  by  placing  hands  under  the  casket,  palms  up).    Handoff  will  command, Ready, STEP.  The entire team will take one side step toward the hearse.  NPB and Fold will gently lower the casket onto the rollers inside the hearse.  Handoff will continue to push the casket into the hearse.  9.24.2.4.  As Handoff passes through the team; each member will release the casket, raise their heads and re-assume the position of attention.  286 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.29.  Hearse Loading (Ready, STEP).  9.24.2.5.  Once the casket is completely in the hearse, Handoff will back-up two steps (6-person team) or three steps (8-person team), starting with the left foot and pause briefly.  Then  they  will  place  their  left  foot  in  front  of  the  right  (toes  pointed  to  the  right),  step back/right  with  the  right  foot  followed  by  the  left  foot  to  their  original  position  at attention.   Figure 9.30.  Hearse Loading (Handoff Repositions).   9.25.  Caisson Loading/Unloading.   The following sequences and techniques are used only by the USAF Honor Guard during FHFs in ANC.  9.25.1.  Casket Transfer and Caisson Loading.   The caisson will always be prepositioned to  the  right  (on  the  right  side  of  the  road)  of  the  pre-determined  parking  location  of  the hearse.    OIC/NCOIC  ensures  the  correct  positioning  of  the  caisson.  They  will  perform  the caisson preparation by positioning the straps on the sides of the caisson and ensure they are not tangled or will be caught under the casket when the caisson is being loaded.  Ensure the adjustable bier pin is removed and the non-adjustable bier pin is positioned in the second or third hole from the front of the caisson.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 287 9.25.1.1.  While  Handoff  is  in  position  at  the  rear  bumper  of  the  hearse  to  remove  the casket; NPB will direct “transfer, no head drops” instead of the numbers for turning steps or  “up  and  face.”    Pallbearers  must  ensure  their  hands  are  positioned  correctly  (thumbs towards Handoff).  9.25.1.2.  After  Handoff  has  commanded  READY  (refer  to  paragraph  9.24.  for  hearse unloading),  NPB  will  command  UP.    When  the  team  has  executed  their  3-second  head raises, NPB calls FACE and then STEP.  9.25.1.3.  The team  will step off and guide to the left, with each left step (the right step will be straight in front, do not cross over with your right foot to guide), until the casket is in line with the caisson.  Figure 9.31.  Caisson Loading (Guide Step).   9.25.1.4.  After the team is behind the caisson is aligned with it, NPB commands HALT followed  by  CENTER.    Once  the  entire  team  has  completed  the  facing  movement  to center  (without  simultaneous  3-second  head  drops),  all  members  will  reposition  their hands  with  thumbs  pointed  towards  NPB.    This  is  accomplished  in  two  3-second movements.  NPB’s side of the casket will release the casket with their right hand and re-grip with their palm facing up.  Next they will release the casket with their left hand and re-grip  the  handle  with  their  palm  facing  down.    Fold’s  side  of  the  casket  will  do  the opposite and all members of the team perform the movements simultaneously.  Next NPB commands FACE.  The team will execute a 3-second facing movement in the direction of the caisson.  NPB then commands STEP and the team to marches toward the caisson.  9.25.1.5.  When  NPB  is  approximately  one  pace  away  from  the  caisson,  he/she  will command, HALT followed by CENTER.  9.25.1.6.  NPB commands  Ready,  UP.  The team raises the casket 6 to  8  inches higher than  the  caisson  at  a  three  second  cadence  using  the  same  techniques  described  in paragraph  9.16.    As  the  top  of  the  casket  rises  past  their  chins,  the  team  members  will raise their heads to normal level.  When the casket is sufficiently high enough to clear the caisson, NPB commands STEP initiating the side steps to place the casket on the caisson.  288 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 As each team member passes the end of the caisson they will gently lower the casket onto the caisson then turn their hands over (palms down) one at a time.  Figure 9.32.  Caisson Loading (STEP).   9.25.1.7.  NPB  commands  HALT  when  the  foot  end  of  the  casket  is  approximately  6 inches from the non-adjustable bier pin on the caisson.  Each pallbearer will press down the casket handles (if applicable) and gently dress the flag along the base of the casket to ensure  there  is  an  even  amount  on  each  side.    All  pallbearers  will  keep  their  arms extended  and  parallel  to  the  ground  closing  their  hands  at  a  fist,  as  if  at  attention,  with palms facing each other and hands touching.  Do not rest  your forearms on the caisson.  This is the caisson stand-by position.  Figure 9.33.  Caisson Loading (Stand-by Position).   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 289 9.25.1.8.  NPB will flare their right hand out at the bottom corner of the casket signaling Fold to simultaneously bring their left hand up over the front end of the casket to the top, take hold of the end of the flag material and drape it over the casket.  Once the motion is complete NPB and Fold will re-place their hands at the base of the casket.  9.25.1.9.  NPB  gives  the  command  Ready,  FLARE.    All  pallbearer’s  hands  are  slowly raised up, palms down, arms straight out with hands together (side by side), and pointed at the top of the casket.  Figure 9.34.  Caisson Loading (Ready, FLARE).   9.25.1.10.  Once all hands are in the flared position, NPB commands, Ready, CUT.  All members bring their closed hands  from  the casket,  in  front  of their shoulders in  a three second cadence, pause  and then lower their hands to  the position of attention in  a three second  cadence.    NPB/Fold  and  Carry/Handoff  will  mirror  each  other.    All  other pallbearers will perform the movements in sync with them.  Figure 9.35.  Caisson Loading(Ready, CUT).   290 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.25.2.  Securing  the  Casket  to  the  Caisson.    With the team at attention NPB clicks their heel together to initiate the “step-arounds” which will reposition the team and enable them to secure the casket to the caisson.  9.25.2.1.  NPB and Handoff take two side steps to their right to their respective ends of the caisson with a three second pause between each step.  9.25.2.2.  (8-Person  Team)  :  Fold  and  Carry  take  two  side  steps  to  their  left  to  their respective  ends  of  the  caisson  with  a  three  second  pause  between  each  step.    (6-Person Team):  Fold and Cross-mark take one side step to their right and align themselves with the buckles on their side of the caisson.  There will be a pause during NPB and Handoff’s first step and step on the second step.  9.25.2.3.  (8-Person Team)  : Mark and Dead Cross-mark take one side step to their right and align themselves with the strap/buckle on their respective sides of the caisson.  There will be a pause during NPB, Fold, Carry and Handoffs’ first step and step on the second step.    (6-Person  Team):  Mark  and  Carry  take  one  side  step  to  their  right  and  align themselves with the straps on their side of the caisson.  There will be a pause during NPB and Handoffs’ first step and step on the second step.  9.25.2.4.  (8-Person Team)  : Cross-mark and Dead Mark take one side step to their left and align themselves with the strap/buckle on their respective sides of the caisson. There will be a pause during NPB, Fold, Carry and Handoffs’ first step and step on the second step.  Figure 9.36.  Securing the Casket to the Caisson (Team Repositions).   9.25.2.5.  NPB gives the command Ready, UP and each designated pallbearer will bring their  closed  hands  from  the  position  of  attention,  bent  at  the  elbow,  up  in  front  of  their shoulders in  a three second movement  and pause for one count.  They  will then extend their  arms  up/out  with  their  hands  flared  (index  fingers  aligned  side-by-side,  thumbs tucked)  toward  the  top  edge  of  the  casket  in  another  three  second  movement.    Finally, they will lower their arms to the caisson stand-by position (paragraph 9.25.1.8.).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 291 9.25.2.6.  (8-Person Team)  : NPB, Fold, Carry, and Handoff fold the four corners of the flag  into  “hospital  corners”,  left  side  over  right.    (6-Person  Team):    NPB  and  Handoff fold the four corners of the flag into “hospital corners”, star side over stripes.  9.25.2.7.  (8-Person  Team)  :  NPB  pulls  the  left  corner  of  the  flag  out  away  from  the casket.  Mark, with their right hand, will pinch/hold the flag together at corner of the base of the casket.  NPB folds the corner against the front of the casket (over Fold’s corner).  (6-Person Team):  NPB pulls the right corner of the flag out away from the casket.

NPB’s side will re-grip with the left hand so the palm is facing down and Fold’s side will re-grip with the right hand.  9.25.4.4.  NPB will command STEP and the team will perform the five turning steps.    AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 303  Table 9.3.  6-Person Caisson Unloading Sequence.

Whenever  it  is  required  to  remove  the  casket  from  a  church  truck/gurney,  bier  or similar device the pallbearer team will begin and/or position themselves so that they are facing the  casket.  NOTE:    If  the  team  is  required  to  remove  or  place  the  casket  from/on  a  catafalque then  procedures  may  need  to  be  adjusted.    NPB  should  use  their  knowledge  and  experience  to incorporate  the  best  technique  for  casket  removal/placement,  for  example  maybe  following  the techniques utilized during caisson loading/unloading or perhaps the vault lid sequence may work best.  9.26.1.  NPB will command  SECURE to  direct  the team  to  take hold  of the casket. On the command of execution, NPB’s side will step toward the casket with their left foot forming a “T’  and  placing  it  parallel  with  the  casket.    Bend  over  with  heads  down,  secure  the  casket handles and move the right foot next to the left foot without heel clicks.  Fold’s side will step toward  the  casket  with  their  right  foot  again  forming  a  “T”  and  placing  it  parallel  with  the casket.  Bend over with heads down, secure the casket handles and move the left foot next to the right foot without heel clicks.  Figure 9.45.  Lifting the Casket from a Church Truck.   9.26.2.  NPB  will  command  Ready  and  each  pallbearer  will  raise  their  heads  up  at  a  three second cadence.  NPB  will then command  UP  and the pallbearers will stand up, lifting the casket off the gurney.  9.26.3.  There may also be occasions where it will be necessary to take hold of a casket on a lowering device if the casket needs to be re-positioned or moved to another location.  In this case, NPB will command  SECURE and the pallbearers will simply squat  down and secure the  casket  handles  with  their  heads  down.    When  securing  the  handles,  ensure  to  position your  hands  in  the  direction  of  travel.    NPB  then  gives  the  command  Ready,  UP.    The pallbearers stand up with the casket.  NPB will then give the appropriate series of commands depended on the situation (either UP and FACE or STEP, HALT, UP and FACE).  9.27.  Aircraft Loading/Unloading.   Aircraft loading and unloading will follow and utilize the same  manuals  and  principles  outlined  throughout  this  chapter.    In  most  situations,  use  the procedures outlined in paragraph 9.25. to lift and retrieve the remains.  Refer to Table A3.2. for sequence procedures.   306 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Section 9D—Carrying Inurned (Cremated) Remains (Cremains) 9.28.  Basics.    When  transporting  an  urn  (cremate  container),  pallbearers  walk  with  suspended arm swing.  NPB will always carry the flag and Fold will carry the urn.  9.28.1.  When  carrying  an  urn  both  hands  will  be  positioned  underneath  the  container  with arms at 90-degree angles and the container four inches from the body.  If the urn is an odd shape then the pallbearer may adjust.  For containers with a small base, such as a vase, and during  windy  conditions  the  pallbearer  may  hold  the  container  with  the  left  hand  flared  on top, palm down and the right hand flared on the bottom with the palm up.  Figure 9.46.  Carrying Inurned Remains.   9.28.2.  If the urn has an inscription or nameplate, the urn is carried with the inscription/name plate facing out away from Fold so the family may read it.  9.28.3.  NPB will halt the team using the same method described in paragraph 9.18.  9.28.4.  The team will carry upstairs or step up onto curbs using the same method described in paragraph 9.22.  9.28.5.  The OIC/NCOIC will follow behind and centered on the team, approximately four to six paces, with suspended arm swing.  Stay in step with the pallbearers.  9.29.  Multiple  Urns.    In  the  case  of  multiple  urns,  Cross-mark  will  carry  the  second  urn.    If more  urns  are  present,  the  funeral  director/representative  should  preposition  those  at  the gravesite.  When urns are at gravesite ensure the ranking or military member’s remains are to the right of other urns (furthest left from the family’s view).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 307 Figure 9.47.  Carrying Multiple Urns.   9.30.  Cremains Retrieval and Placement.   This paragraph outlines the general guidelines and principles  for  removing  cremains  from  a  vehicle,  modified  casket/caisson,  placing  them  in  the modified  casket/caisson  and  setting  them  down.    These  procedures  will  be  followed  for  all funerals and sequences involving cremains.  9.30.1.  Retrieval  from  a  Vehicle.    NPB  and  Fold  (Cross-mark  if  there  is  a  second  urn) march up to the car (in a slow cadence with suspended arm swing. When NPB and Fold pass the rear wheel of the car NPB gives the command of “One” in a low tone signaling that they will take two more steps and close on the third step. NOTE:  The command “Two” may also be  used  indicating  that  the  members  will  only  take  one  more  step  and  close.    Repeating  a number  is  another  method  that  may  be  used  to  recover  from  a  mistake  or  in  abnormal situations.  This command is designed for this purpose.  9.30.1.1.  NPB and Fold (Cross-mark if there is a second urn), will automatically face the vehicle then retrieve the urn and flag.  (Multiple Urns):  Fold will secure the dependent or additional  urn  first  and  hand  to  Cross-mark  with  both  members  rotating  at  the  waist  to give/receive the container.  9.30.1.2.  NPB and Fold will quietly confirm that they are both ready to stand upright by saying “Ready”.  Together, they slowly stand back up.  9.30.1.3.  Both (and Cross-mark if there is a second urn) simultaneously face toward the pallbearer team and then automatically step off with their left foot.  9.30.1.4.  To place remains in a vehicle follow the same procedures outlined in paragraph 9.30.  9.30.2.  Transfer to and Placement in the Modified Casket/Caisson.   Prior to conducting this  sequence  OIC/NCOIC  must  ensure  the  caisson  is  prepped.    OIC/NCOIC  will  prep  the caisson  upon  pre-positioning,  prior  to  the  ceremony.  The  caisson  is  prepped  as  follows: remove the adjustable bier pin,  fold the flag neatly on top of the casket,  pull the drawer all the way out and ensure there is no debris or obstructions.  9.30.2.1.  After retrieving the cremains from the vehicle, NPB commands Ready, FACE and  the  team  executes  a  right  face,  takes  five  steps  then  executes  an  honor  guard  style flanking movement to align behind the caisson.  308 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.30.2.2.  After  the  team  left  flanks  behind  the  caisson  and  aligned  with  it,  Handoff, Carry, Mark and Cross-mark will halt.  NPB and Fold will continue to march toward the caisson, shoulder-to-shoulder. Approximately 3 to 4 paces away from  the caisson, NPB gives the command Ready,  9.30.2.3.  SPLIT in a low tone.  Figure 9.48.  Cremains Retrieval and Placement (Ready, SPLIT).   9.30.2.4.  Fold and NPB will split the drawer of the cremate casket on the caisson, taking three  steps  and  closing  on  the  fourth  approximately  one  pace  away  from  the  caisson. After halting behind the caisson NPB and fold perform a three second head drop. NOTE:  Once stopped at the rear of the caisson NPB and Fold should be facing the cremate casket at a 45-degree angle.  9.30.2.5.  Fold  lifts  up  the  urn  and  places  it  into  the  left  side  of  the  drawer.    NPB performs the “half-dress” sequence and places the flag into the right side of the drawer. NOTE:  The urn is always placed into the drawer first.  Figure 9.49.  Cremains Retrieval and Placement (Urn and Flag Placement).   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 309 9.30.2.6.  NPB commands Ready, DRAWER, NPB and Fold place their inside hands on their ends of the drawer handle.  Figure 9.50.  Cremains Retrieval and Placement (Ready, DRAWER).   9.30.2.7.  NPB  commands  Ready,  PUSH,  they  slowly  push  the  drawer  closed.  NOTE: NPB ensures that the tip of the flag inside the drawer is not protruding from the drawer as it is closed.  Figure 9.51.  Cremains Retrieval and Placement (Ready, PUSH).   9.30.2.8.  NPB  commands  Ready,  FLAG.    NPB  and  Fold  secure  the  flag  by  the  ring portions of the white-edged band with their outside hands with their inside hands still on the drawer handle.  310 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.30.2.9.  NPB  quietly  commands  Ready,  STEP.    Simultaneously,  NPB  and  Fold  take one side step toward each other and pull the flag, draping it over the mock-casket.  Figure 9.52.  Cremains Retrieval and Placement (Ready, STEP).  9.30.2.10.  NPB and Fold perform the flag blousing.   9.30.2.11.  NPB  pulls  the  right  corner  of  the  flag  out  away  from  the  casket.    With  their left hand, pinch/hold the flag together at corner of the base of the casket.  NPB places the corner against the casket.  9.30.2.12.  Fold  pulls  the  left  corner  of  the  flag  out  away  from  the  casket.    With  their right hand, pinch/hold the flag together at corner of the base of the casket, and folds the corner  against  the  casket  over  NPB’s  corner.  NOTE:    When  blousing  the  flag,  ensure enough  material  traps  between  the  bier  pin  and  the  casket  to  prevent  it  from  coming loose.  9.30.2.13.  Once NPB and Fold have completed blousing the flag, NPB secures the casket on the caisson by placing the rear adjustable bier pin into the roller frame and tightening the  crank.  NOTE:    Fold  holds  the  “hospital  corners”  in  place  until  NPB  secures  the adjustable bier pin.  9.30.2.14.  NPB quietly commands Ready, FLARE and Ready, CUT.  9.30.2.15.  NPB commands Ready, STEP.  NPB and Fold take one step back with their left foot; execute a 3-count about face and step off on the third count.  9.30.2.16.  NPB quietly  commands  HALT one pace  from  Mark and Cross-mark.  Once halted,  NPB  and  Fold  automatically  execute  a  slow  3-count  about  face  and  remain  at attention.  9.30.2.17.  NPB commands Stand at EASE.  9.30.3.  Retrieval  from  the  Caisson.    OIC/NCOIC  stops  the  caisson  at  the  pre-designated location.  He/she will step off and remove the adjustable bier pin, neatly fold the flag on top of the casket, pull the drawer all the way out and then position the flag for the pallbearers to AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 311 retrieve.    NPB  commands  Mark,  TIME  once  the  team  is  adjacent  to  the  pre-determined route to gravesite and HALT’s the team. Team executes an automatic Stand at Ease.  9.30.3.1.  NPB  and  Fold  step  off  with  their  left  foot,  suspended  arm  swing  and  are shoulder to shoulder.  9.30.3.2.  NPB  quietly  commands  Ready,  SPLIT  three  to  four  paces  away  from  the caisson.    NPB  and  Fold  split  apart  slightly  and  approach  opposite  sides  of  the  casket drawer at 45-degree angles.  9.30.3.3.  NPB  quietly  commands  Ready,  UP.    NPB  extracts  the  flag  from  the  drawer and secures the flag.  Fold removes the urn.  9.30.3.4.  NPB closes the drawer with their left hand.  9.30.3.5.  NPB  quietly  commands  Ready  STEP.    NPB  and  Fold  take  one  side  step towards each other.  9.30.3.6.  NPB will re-install the adjustable bier pin with his left hand.  The pin does not have to be tightened.  9.30.3.7.  NPB  commands  Ready,  STEP.    NPB  and  Fold  take  one  step  back  with  their left foot; execute a 3-count about face and slide-step off back to the rest of the team.  9.30.3.8.  NPB  quietly  commands  HALT  one  pace  from  Mark  and  Cross-mark.    Once halted,  NPB  and  Fold  automatically  execute  a  slow  3-count  about  face  and  remain  at attention.  9.30.4.  Transferring Double Urns to Gravesite.  9.30.4.1.  If multiple urns are present, Cross-Mark will hand the cremains to Fold prior to performing the 3-count about face.  9.30.4.2.  If  Fold  is  required  to  hold  an  urn,  the  bearers  will  not  perform  an  automatic Stand at Ease, and remain at the position of attention.  9.30.4.3.  Upon  the  command  SECURE,  Fold  will  execute  a  3-count  about  face  and transfer the cremains to Cross-Mark.  Once Cross-Mark has control of the cremains, Fold will execute another 3-count about face and slide-step to the caisson.  NPB will step off with Fold at the same time.  Section 9E—Flag Handling and Folding 9.31.  General.   There are three different flag folding sequences utilized by the Air Force.  The three flag folding sequences are Two-person, Six-person and Eight-person.  9.30.1.  All  flag  folding  sequences  are  based  on  the  5’x  9.5’  U.S.  Interment  Flag  (NSN: 8345-01-334-8825).  Except for Retreat ceremonies, this is the only flag that Air Force honor guards  will  be  required  to  fold  during  ceremonies.    When  NPB  carries  the  flag  during  a funeral with cremated remains, he/she will carry the flag with it pressed against the chest, left hand on top of the right with the middle fingers touching.  Thumbs will be aligned and joined with the forefingers and there will be no space visible space in between any of the fingers.  312 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.32.  Stars  over  Stripes.    This  sequence  is  done  when  the  flag  is  reversed  so  that  the  union (blue  field  of  stars)  is  closest  to  Carry  instead  of  Handoff.  NOTE:  This  sequence  should  be completed at the “canoe” position.  9.32.1.  Any pallbearer may quietly call  STARS  OVER  STRIPES.  The procedures are as follows:  9.32.2.  NPB’s side slowly raises their side of the flag and extends it towards folds side.  9.32.3.  Simultaneously fold’s side slowly lowers their side of the flag and extends it towards NPB’s side.  9.32.4.  Fold’s side takes the higher edge of the flag with their right hands.  NPB’s side takes the lower edge of the flag with their right hands.  9.32.5.  The  pallbearers  re-assume  the  “canoe”  position  and  carry  on  with  the  “table  top” sequence.  9.32.6.  If performing a two person flag fold and Stars over Stripes is required; bring hands together grip both edges of flag with one hand then grip stars side with other hand and pull over stripes side.  9.33.  Thumb Signals.   While at the “table top” position during a six or eight person flag fold, thumb signals are used to ensure a level and taut flag.  Mark and Cross-mark set the level of the flag  (the  level  will  be  set  at  the  second  button  on  the  ceremonial  blouse,  no  lower  than  waist level).  The team member directly across from the person needing to make adjustments will give the thumb signals.  All pallbearers are responsible for correcting the person directly across from them.  Thumb signals are as follows:  9.33.1.  To signal someone to bring the flag up slightly lift the corresponding thumb up from the flag across from the position where the correction is needed until it is raised even with the rest of the flag.  9.33.2.  To  signal  someone  to  bring  the  flag  down  slightly  bend  the  corresponding  thumb down to the flag across from the position where the correction is needed until it is lowered even with the rest of the flag.  9.33.3.  To  signal  someone  to  release  wrinkled  flag  material,  slightly  release  the corresponding hand from the flag and re-grip.  9.33.4.  To  signal  someone  to  pull  tension  on  the  flag,  (flag  material  starts  to  sink/droop), slightly move both thumbs side to side until the corresponding person has added tension on the flag.  NOTE:  All  pallbearers must be constantly aware of the level  and tightness of the flag throughout the entire funeral ceremony.  Thumb corrections should be given slowly and ceremoniously; not quickly so as to detract from the funeral and not during taps.  9.34.  Two Person Flag Fold.   Two person flag folds are conducted during funerals, retirements and Retreat ceremonies.  9.34.1.  (Step  1)  .    Fold  the  flag  in  half  long  ways,  leaving  half  the  red  stripe,  and  the horizontal  portion  of  the  top  star.    This  is  known  as  establishing  the  border;  the  two  open ends do not lie evenly upon each other, there must be a definite margin.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 313 9.34.2.  (Step 2)  . Bring the hand not securing the established border back to the top corner.  Simultaneously, the NCOIC and Fold flare down with the non-gripping hand and secure the bottom  corner  with  that  hand.  Next  rotate  the  flag  90-degrees  to  NCOIC’s  left  and  Folds right.  9.34.3.  (Step 3)  .  Repeat steps 1 and 2.  9.34.4.  (Step 4)  . Next, Fold begins by making a triangular fold bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to the open edge (left hand will make the first triangle fold).  Ensure the outside edge of the fold forms a 90-degree angle with edge of flag.  9.34.5.  (Step 5)  . With your fingers, divide the white stripe on the first fold in half. Fold the outer point over, in line with the open edge, to form second triangle. Fold always steps when the “flat” edge of the flag is toward them.  9.34.6.  When folding use the method described below to maintain proper control and tension on the flag.  9.34.7.  (1)  .  After making the initial fold, maintain tension on the flag by pulling back with the right hand.  Move the left hand to the corner nearest the right hand with the palm facing towards the ground.  9.34.8.  (2)  .  Next, using the left hand, crease down the flag then to where the body of the flag will be folded over again.  9.34.9.  (3)  .  In a quick movement, move the right hand up to grip the flag parallel to the left hand with  both  palms facing towards the  ground.  Continue folding alternating which hand creases  and  maintains  tension.    Fold  always  creases  the  flag  when  the  “angle”  is  toward them. NOTE:  Place pinky fingers on edge of the body of the flag to ensure proper folds.  9.34.10.  (Step 6)  . Continue folding the flag alternating steps 4 and 5 until the flag reaches the end (approximately 4-10 inches but may vary).  This process usually involves 13 folds on the standard internment flag.  9.34.11.  (Step 7)  . Fold reaches underneath the flag with the left hand pulling the single flap toward the 90-degree angle on the open end, tucking it into the flag and pinching it against the body of the flag (inside the flag), slightly lifting up the flap with right hand, cradling it with the left arm.  9.34.12.  (Step  8)  .  The  NCOIC  makes  a  45-degree  fold  with  the  right  side  of  the  flag, ensuring a gap of approximately one inch distance is placed in between the fold and the flag.  9.34.13.  (Step  9)  .  Crease  the  excess  portion  of  the  flag  and  neatly  tuck  it  in  the  pocket formed by the folded flag.  9.35.  Six  and  Eight  Person  Flag  Fold.    The  following  describes  the  instructions  for  the  six person  flag  fold.    Procedures  that  are  unique  to  the  eight  person  flag  fold  will  be  stated; otherwise all the same instructions will be followed.  9.35.1.  Once the flag draped casket has been set down at gravesite (paragraph 9.16.4.1.), all pallbearers will grab their respective ends of the flag, and the team will rise to the standing position. The cadence to rise will be off of Mark and Cross-mark.  314 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.35.2.  NPB, Fold, Carry and Handoff’s hands will be at that respective end of the flag, their inside hand will be approximately in line with their inside shoulder.  Mark and Cross-mark will center their hands  approximately shoulder width apart.   All  team  members will extend their  arms  out;  no  lower  than  waist  level  so  that  the  flag  forms  a  “canoe”  shape  over  the casket.  This level will be set off of Mark and Cross-Mark.  Heads will be looking down at a 45 degree angle. NOTE:  NPB, Fold, Carry, Handoff many use their outside hand to secure the flag ends before the casket is set down on the lowering device or similar platform.  Figure 9.53.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (“Canoe”).   9.35.3.  At  this  point,  either  Mark  or  Cross-mark  (whomever’  s  back  is  toward  the  family) will say Ready, STEP for the team in a normal conversational tone.  NPB, Fold, Carry and Handoff will take one side step towards their respective ends of the flag.  Mark and Cross-mark will take one side step towards the union/head end of the flag.  (8-person):  Mark and Cross-mark take one side step towards the foot end of the flag (NPB/Fold).  Dead Mark and Dead Cross-mark take one side step toward the union/head end of the flag (Carry/Handoff).  9.35.4.  Once  the  side  step  is  complete  the  entire  team  will  fold  the  outside  of  the  flag underneath 2 ½ stripes (i.e. fold one red stripe underneath, then one white stripe and then ½ of a red stripe). As soon as the 2 ½ fold are set all team  members (except  NPB) will bring their  inside  hands  together  with  their  outside  hands  so  their  thumbs  touching.  NPB  will maintain a grip on the outer edge of the flag with their outside hand; their inside hand will be positioned app 6-8 inches away from their outside hand.  9.35.5.  Cross-mark  hands  are  together  where  the  “Union”  (blue  field  with  stars)  meets  the stripes.  Mark’s hands are directly across from Cross-mark’s.  NOTE:  NPB will tug on the flag to begin different portions of the folding sequence.  All movements (with the exception of NPB’s tugs) are synchronized and performed simultaneously by each member on the team.  These movements have a “mirror-like” effect when performed properly.  9.35.6.  Once all movement has stopped and the team member’s hands have stopped moving the NPB will tug the flag to signal the team to spread their hand app shoulder width apart in a three second cadence.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 315 Figure 9.54.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (1st Flag Tug).   9.35.7.  Once all movement has stopped NPB will tug (2 counts) the flag a second time and the  bearers  will  bring  the  flag  to  the  tabletop  position.    Bringing  the  flag  to  tabletop  is performed in two counts. On the first count each member will step with the appropriate foot to center themselves on their hands. Three things will happen simultaneously on the second count; the feet  will close at  the proper position of attention without heel  clicks,  your hands will pull the flag  so it is tight  and wrinkle free  at  approximately waist level  (remember the flag height will be set off Mark and Cross-mark and it will not be resting on the casket), and the head will return back to the position of attention.  Do not yank or pop the flag, moving to table top is a deliberate yet smooth movement.  The OIC/NCOIC will move to stand at ease in cadence with the pallbearer’s movement to tabletop.  9.35.8.  At the table top position, the optimal distance between the left and right hands when holding the flag should be shoulder width.  All thumbs should be visible on top of the flag at this  position  with  the  material  pinched  between  the  thumb  and  index  finger.    All  fingers underneath the flag will be curled like a fist.  Figure 9.55.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (2nd Flag Tug/Tabletop).   316 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.35.9.  Once  it  is  time  to  fold  the  flag,  NPB  will  tug  on  the  flag  to  begin  the  folding sequence.  9.35.10.  (Step 1)  .  (Count 1). All members will simultaneously close their hands together, dropping their heads at a 45-degree angle looking at the flag. Corners will close toward their outside hand, Mark and Cross-mark will close toward the union. This will make an audible smack. Do not rotate the shoulders when closing the hands together.  (8-person):  Mark and Cross-mark will close towards NPB.  Dead Mark and Dead Cross-mark will close toward the Union.    As  a  rule  of  thumb,  the  middle  pallbearers  will  always  mirror  the  outside  corners they are closest to.  Figure 9.56.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Flag Tug/Count 1).   9.35.11.  (Count  2)  . NPB and Carry will use the index, middle finger and thumb (of their outside  hand)  to  cut  the  flag  even  with  the  bottom  of  the  Union  simultaneously  pulling outward  on  the  flag.  Mark  will  reach  under  the  flag  with  their  left  hand  and  pinch  it  even with the union, while gripping it with their right at the same place they brought their hands together.  Handoff  and  Cross-mark  will  placer  their  left  hands  under  the  flag  to  support  it. Fold will place their right hand under the flag to support it. (8-person):  Dead Mark will reach under  the  flag  with  their  left  hand  and  pinch  it  even  with  the  union,  while  gripping  it  with their  right  at  the  same  place  they  brought  their  hands  together.    Mark  will  reach  under  the flag with  their right  hand and pinch it even with the bottom  of the union, while  gripping it with their left hand at the same place they brought their hands together.  As a rule of thumb, the middle pallbearers will always mirror the outside corners they are closest to.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 317 Figure 9.57.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Count 2).   9.35.12.  (Count  3)  . NPB, Mark and Carry will “throw” (flaring their hand in the process) the  edge  of  the  flag  toward  the  person  across  from  them,  aiming  their  flared  hand  at  the person’s hand across from them. Handoff, Cross-mark, and Fold will stand fast.  Figure 9.58.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Count 3).   9.35.13.  (Count 4)  . Mark and Carry will place their flared right hands, to the wrist, under the flag.  NPB  will place their flared left  hand, to the wrist, under the flag.  NOTE:   During exceptionally  windy  conditions  NPB,  Mark  and  Carry  will  all  hold  the  hand  they  used  to “throw”  at  a  flare  until  Fold’s  side  has  gained  control  of  the  flag.    On  “count  5”  they  will place their hands under the flag as described in paragraph 9.35.14.  318 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.59.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Count 4).   9.35.14.  (Count 5)  .  Fold, Cross and Handoff set the thrown edge of the flag approximately 1 ½ to 2 inches from the under portions edge (half the red stripe and the horizontal portion of the  top  star).  Once  the  borders  are  set  on  the  flag,  Fold,  Cross-mark  and  Handoff  will  re-place  their  hands  to  their  original  positions  approximately  shoulder  width  apart.  NPB  and Carry will pull on the underside of the flag by placing their fingers inside the fold they just created and pulling it tight to ensure it is tight and not drooping.  Figure 9.60.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Count 5).  9.35.15.  Once  all  movement  has  ceased  NPB,  Mark  and  Carry  will  pull  out  their  support hands in sync with Mark.  Mark will then guide the flag back to center between the two sides of the team. Simultaneously, the entire team will raise their heads looking straight  forward. NPB tugs the flag again. Members will re-complete Step 1, Counts 1-5 with one exception. Once the flag has been thrown over NPB, Mark and Carry will automatically re-grip the flag at approximately shoulder width.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 319 Figure 9.61.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Setting Quarter Fold).  9.35.16.  (Step  2)  .  Once  the  borders  are  set  on  the  flag,  NPB  moves  their  left  hand  up  to touch their right hand (thumbs come together) then slide hands apart until their left thumb is approximately 10-12 inches away from their right.  Fold’s hands should mirror NPB’s.  This is called “setting the box”. Mark will pull (guide) the flag back to center. The flag is now in the “quarter fold” position.   Figure 9.62.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (STEP 2).  9.35.17.  (Step  3)  .  NPB  makes  the  first  fold  using  their  right  hand  to  put  the  corner  flush with the edge of the flag that is part of the border set by the two tugs, held in the Fold’s right hand,  to  create  a  triangular  effect  (NPB  must  flare  their  hand  when  folding  the  flag  over).  NPB  creases  the  edge  of  the  flag  towards  their  position  with  their  right  hand  (with  their thumb on top of the flag “thumb towards"); once NPB has completed their crease, Fold will crease  the  flag  to  the  right  with  their  right  hand  (fingers  on  top  of  the  flag  “hands  away”).  320 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Both  members  will  position  their  creasing  hands  appropriately  on  the  edge  of  the  flag, judging by the length/manufacturer of the flag whether or not to “cut” ½ of the white stripe.  Figure 9.63.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 3; 1st Fold).  9.35.18.  Fold will rotate their right wrist and fold the flag over, making the flag edge parallel as shown in  Figure 9.64.  Simultaneously they  will  release with  their left hand and place it across  the  flag  next  to  NPB’s  hands  and  perform  a  “thumbs  toward”  crease.  After  the “thumbs toward,” fold will execute a “hands away”. NPB will roll their hands with the fold that  fold  is  making.  Then  slide  their  left  hand,  with  the  thumb  on  top,  approximately  10 inches to the left.   Figure 9.64.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 3; 2nd Fold).  9.35.19.  Using  their  left  hand,  Fold  will  place  the  corner  flush  with  the  edge  of  the  folded edge of the flag, Fold will flare their hand. Fold creases the flag towards their position with their left hand “thumb towards"; NPB then creases the flag towards their left with their left  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 321 hand “hands away”.  Both members will stop  the crease  at  the end of the folded part of the flag.  Figure 9.65.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 3; 3rd Fold).   9.35.20.  (Step  4)  . Next NPB will rotate their left wrist and fold the flag over, making the flag edge parallel with the folded edge. Simultaneously they will release with their right hand and place it across the flag next to fold’s hands and perform a “thumbs toward” crease. After the “thumbs toward” NPB will execute a  “hands  away”. Fold  will roll their hands with  the fold that NPB is making. Then slide their right hand, with the thumb on top, approximately 10 inches to the right.  322 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.66.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 4).   9.35.21.  Repeat the steps outlined in paragraphs 9.35.17. through 9.35.20. until the 13th fold is completed.  9.35.22.  (Step  5)  . As  NPB and  Fold  will fold  the flag, the team  members not  folding the flag  (Mark,  Cross-mark,  Carry  and  Handoff)  should  be  feeding  the  flag  toward  NPB  and Fold.  The members that are across from each other feed together to achieve a “mirror-like” effect.    Once  a  pallbearer’s  hands  leave  the  flag,  they  re-assume  the  position  of  attention.  Mark and Cross-mark will not let go of the flag until the flag is completely tucked. NOTE:  It is NPB and Fold’s responsibility to pull the flag in front of them.  The flag should be folded in front of NPB and Fold. Tension on the flag while folding is  created from Carry/Handoff and  Mark/  Cross-mark  (upon  release  by  Carry/Handoff)  maintain  a  firm  grip  on  their respective corners of the flag.  9.35.23.  When Mark and Cross-mark’s arms are fully extended toward NPB and Fold, Mark or Cross-mark (whomever’ s back is  to  the  family)  will  give an eyewink, Mark  and Cross-mark will simultaneously step toward the NPB and Fold (not necessarily on the eighth fold), to ensure they step at the same time.  (8-person):  Mark and Cross-mark do not step towards NPB.  9.35.24.  The tip of the flag should enter the Union without exceeding the second star on the eighth  fold.    This  is  to  prevent  the  flag  from  being  folded  too  long,  thus  not  allowing  the excess flag to be tucked at the end.  Ensure the tip does not land short of the blue, or there will be too much material to tuck in and the flag will look like a “pillow”.  On the 10th fold, AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 323 Cross-mark will slightly pull out on the blue material (union).  Fold rolls all red material on the flag tip using the blue material of the union that has been pulled.  Figure 9.67.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 5).  9.35.25.  At the last fold (usually the 13th fold); with tip approximately three inches from the edge  of  the  white  band,  Mark  and  Cross-mark  are  ready  to  tuck  the  remaining  excess  flag into  the  open  edge  of  the  folded  flag.    NPB  will  hold  the  flag  open  by  supporting  the  flag with  their  right  hand  underneath  with  their  thumb  on  top  not  pinching  the  flag.    They  will slightly open the “flap” with their left hand. Fold secures the flag by holding the corner of the flag closest to them with their left hand and lifting up the “flap” with their right hand.   324 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.68.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 5; 13th Fold).   9.35.26.  (Step 6)  . Mark begins the tucking sequence by folding a 45-degree angle with the band  material  on  their  side,  leaving  approximately  a  one  inch  space  to  clear  the  lip  of  the flag. Cross-mark pulls the material tight with their right hand and pinches the left corner of flag with the left hand (index and/or thumb inside the opening) ensuring the material is taut and  tucks  the  flag  with  the  right,  pushing  all  the  material  to  the  inside  of  the  flag,  making sure  the  metal  ring  is  flat.  NOTE:  Mark  and  Cross-mark  ensure  the  tucked  band  lies  flat inside of the opening. Any material that is bunching up will be pushed to Mark so Mark can roll it under the backside of the flag.  Figure 9.69.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 6)   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 325 9.35.27.  (Step  7)  .  NPB  and  Fold  will  release  the  “flap”  once  the  band  is  tucked  inside.  NPB places both hands palms up (fingers underneath the flag and thumbs above the flag) on the flag.  9.35.28.  (Step  8)  .  When  the  tucking  of  the  flag  is  complete  Fold,  Cross-mark,  and  Mark will hold the flag at their respective corners with the thumbs together on top of the flag.  Figure 9.70.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 8).   9.35.29.  (Step  9)  .   NPB then pulls the flag to  themselves, and then  flips  their hands over (fingers together on top, thumbs underneath).  NPB creases the flag by  slowly sliding their hands apart along the edge of the flag (actually crease the flag, this is a chance to make the flag  flatter  and sharper).   NPB takes the  flag with  both  hands by reaching (simultaneously) over to the top apex which is pointing towards Cross-mark (thumbs on top).  326 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.71.  Six and Eight Person Flag Fold (Step 9).  9.35.30.  (Step 10). NPB pulls the flag directly to their chest with the apex of the flag just below the sternum and then executes the appropriate sequence.  NOTE:  If a Military Chaplain is present Handoff will receive flag through pass down sequence, perform Full Dress, and present flag to Chaplain. Chaplain will then present flag to NOK.   Table 9.5.  Six and Eight Person Flag Folding Sequence  9.36.  Dressing Sequences.  9.36.1.  Half Dress.    The Half Dress is performed any time the flag is being passed on to a pallbearer  within  the  team  and  the  flag  must  be  unfolded.    The  Half  Dress  is  a  simulated inspection  to  prepare  the  flag  to  be  uncased.    This  movement  is  executed  in  five-counts  of three-second increments. NOTE:  Whenever this sequence is performed, the open side of the flag “flap” will be on the left hand side of the pallbearer performing the dress.  9.36.1.1.  Once the flag is folded, NPB takes the flag with both hands by reaching over to the top apex that is pointing towards the Cross-mark (thumbs on top, fingers together on bottom).  9.36.1.2.  NPB  pulls  the  flag  directly  to  their  chest  (the  apex  of  the  flag  just  below  the sternum) looking down at the flag (figure 9.77.).  The Half Dress sequence is as follows:  9.36.1.3.  (Count  1)  .  Place  the  flared  left  hand  under  the  front/bottom  of  the  flag “cradling” it and pushing it against the chest.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 327 Figure 9.72.  Half Dress (Count 1).   9.36.1.4.  (Count  2)  .  Move  the  flared  right  hand  directly  to  the  left  corner  of  the  flag (over the left elbow).  Figure 9.73.  Half Dress (Count 2).   9.36.1.5.  (Count 3)  . Slide the flared right hand up the left edge, “flap” of the flag to the top corner of the apex.  328 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.74.  Half Dress (Count 3).   9.36.1.6.  (Count  4)  . Grasp on the left side of the flag with the right hand, keeping all fingers joined.  Figure 9.75.  Half Dress (Count 4).   9.36.1.7.  (Count 5)  . Rotate flag up in a clockwise motion with the right hand, keeping the left hand stationary on the front side (palm on flag).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 329 Figure 9.76.  Half Dress (Count 5).   9.36.2.  Full  Dress.    The Full Dress sequence is performed upon completion of folding the flag.  It simulates inspecting the flag and acts as a ceremonious “final look” upon casing the flag.    For  funerals  it  is  performed  prior  to  and  when  the  flag  is  being  passed  to  the OIC/NCOIC  or  Chaplin  who  will  be  presenting  the  flag  to  the  NOK.    This  movement  is executed  in  9-counts  of  three-second  increments.  NOTE:    Whenever  this  sequence  is performed,  the  open  side  of  the  flag  “flap”  will  be  on  the  left  hand  side  of  the  pallbearer performing the dress.  9.36.2.1.  Inspect  the  flag  for  any  red/white  material  without  head  movement  or “dipping”  the  outer  most  corners  of  the  flag  to  the  left  or  right.    Once  inspection  is complete, position both hands at the top portion of the flag.  Hands will be palms  down thumbs on the body side with the fingers extended and joined.  330 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.77.  Full Dress (Inspection).   9.36.2.2.  (Count  1)  .  Slowly  slide  the  flared  left  hand  down  the  open  side  of  the  flag “flap”, extending the arm out/down, and pause.  Figure 9.78.  Full Dress (Count 1).   9.36.2.3.  (Count 2)  .

Rotate  the  flag  in  a  clockwise  motion  with  the  right  hand  while simultaneously lifting the flag up and pinning the left hand to the left side and pause.  Figure 9.84.  Full Dress (Count 7).  9.36.2.9.  (Count 8)  . Lower the flag until the top of the flag is at eye level and pause.   334 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.85.  Full Dress (Count 8).   9.36.2.10.  (Count  9)  .  The  left  hand  comes  up  to  join  the  right  hand,  ensuring  the fingers are extended, joined and remain together. Hands will be left over right.  Figure 9.86.  Full Dress (Count 9).   9.36.2.11.

(7-Person  Funeral):    Lower  the flag to chin level and pin elbows at side.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 335 Figure 9.87.  Flag Handoff.   9.37.  Passing the flag from NPB to Handoff.  9.37.1.  Once the urn has been set down on the table and Fold has returned to their position across from NPB or upon completion of the flag fold and a military chaplain is present, NPB performs the Half Dress sequence.  9.37.2.  (Step 1)  . NPB extends the flag out (arms inverted, flag resting on arms, holding the flag on opposite sides of the apex, palms up and thumbs/fingers together) with the 90-degree angle pointing toward Fold.  Fold takes the flag with their left hand on top and the right hand underneath (palm up).  Fold makes eye contact with the NPB to signal control of the flag.  (8-person):    NPB  places  their  right  hand  on  the  side  of  the  flag  facing  them  (palm  on  flag).  Simultaneously,  NPB  turns  the  flag  over  (left  hand  over  right  hand)  and  lowers  it  to  Fold (straight edge facing  Fold).   Fold  takes the flag  by the two 45-degree  angles  (horns) palms down fingers/thumbs closed together.  336 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.88.  Passing the Flag from NPB to Handoff (Step 1).   9.37.3.  (Step  2)  .  Fold  brings  the  flag  a  fist  distance  of  their  body,  level  with  the  second button of their ceremonial blouse.  Fold  and Cross-mark slowly turn towards each other (at the hip) and Fold extends the flag out towards Cross-mark.  Cross-mark meets fold half way taking the flag by the two 45-degree angles (horns).  Cross-mark thumbs need to be along the side of their hands.  Cross-mark makes eye contact with the Fold signaling they have control of the flag.   (8-person):   Fold  slowly turns to  Cross-mark and extends the flag out.   Cross-mark  takes  the  flag  with  their  left  hand  on  top  and  the  right  hand  underneath  (palm  up).  Cross-mark  slowly  turns  to  Dead  Cross-mark  and  extends  the  flag  out.    Dead  Cross-mark takes  the  flag  by  the  two  45-degree  angles  (horns)  palms  down  fingers/thumbs  closed together.  Figure 9.89.  Passing the Flag from NPB to Handoff (Step 2).   9.37.4.  (Step  3)  . Cross-mark brings the flag within fist  distance of  their body, (level  with the second button of their ceremonial blouse) simultaneously turning toward Handoff. Cross-AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 337 mark and Handoff turn towards each other (at the hip) and Cross-mark extends the flag out. Handoff secures the flag from Cross-mark by the 90-degree angle with their fingers together on  top  of  the  flag  (thumbs  underneath).  Handoff  makes  eye  contact  with  Cross-mark signaling  control  of  the  flag.    (8-person):    Dead  Cross-mark  slowly  turns  to  Handoff  and extends the flag out.    Handoff secures the  flag as by the 90-degree angle with  their fingers together on top of the flag (thumbs underneath).  Figure 9.90.  Passing the Flag from NPB to Handoff (Step 3).   9.37.5.  Handoff brings the flag to their body and performs the Full Dress Sequence. Handoff will perform the Half Dress sequence if they are re-folding the flag or are starting to fold the flag for a cremate sequence.  9.38.  Flag Break Down (Unfolding) Sequence.  9.38.1.  (Step  1)  .    Handoff  extends  the  flag  down  to  waist  level  and  out  toward  Carry (“flap” facing carry).  After the flag is extended out and the open “flap” (pulling the material down toward the ground) facing Carry with their right hand.  (two-person flag fold):  NCOIC extends the flag down to waist level and out toward Fold (“flap” facing Fold).  After the flag is  extended  out  and  the  open  “flap”  (pulling  the  material  down  toward  the  ground)  facing Fold with their right hand.  338 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.91.  Handoff Extends Flag.   9.38.2.  Carry raises their hands to meet Handoff with the flag.  Once the flap is open, Carry pulls out the end of the flag (white band w/rings).  As Carry pulls out the band, Handoff turns the open end (flap) to  the right.   This  material  will  drape over Handoff’s outstretched right arm,  placing  the  folded  corner  edge  in  Handoff’s  right  hand.    (two-person  flag  fold):    Fold raises their hands to meet NCOIC with the flag.  Once the flap is open, Fold pulls out the end of  the  flag  (white  band  w/rings).    As  Fold  pulls  out  the  band,  NCOIC  turns  the  open  end (flap) to the right.  This  material will draped over NCOIC’s outstretched right  arm, placing the folded corner edge in NCOIC’s right hand.  Figure 9.92.  Carry Unfolds Flag.   9.38.3.  (Step 2)  .  Carry unfolds the flag toward Mark.  Handoff places their left hand (palm up) under the first portion of the flag unfolded by Carry.  Handoff’s left hand will support the flag as it is being unfolded.  (two-person flag fold):  Fold begins unfolding the flag retracing the same steps described in paragraph 9.33.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 339 Figure 9.93.  Mark Unfolds Flag.   9.38.4.  As  Carry  continues  to  unfold  the  flag  Mark  or  Cross-mark  (whomever’s  back  is toward the family) gives an eyewink signaling the other to simultaneously raise their hands to take  the  flag.    Once  Mark  takes  the  flag,  Carry  takes  the  folded  corner  edge  from  Handoff with  their  left  hand  and  supports  the  flag  with  their  right  hand  underneath  (palm  up).  Handoff  holds  the  flag  with  both  hands,  fingers  clasped  in  fists  underneath  the  flag  (palms facing each other), thumbs on top, between the folded edges.  9.38.5.  Cross-mark  supports  the  flag  with  both  hands  underneath  (palms  up).    Mark continues the unfold process from Carry.  9.38.6.  As Mark continues to unfold the flag NPB or Fold (whomever’ s back is toward the family) gives an eyewink signaling the other to  simultaneously raise their hands to take the flag.  Once NPB takes the flag, Mark takes the flag corner edge in their left hand (left hand placed  on  the  edge  of  the  blue  field  of  stars)  and  supports  the  flag  with  their  right  hand underneath  (palm  up).    Cross-mark  holds  the  flag  with  both  hands,  fingers  clasped  in  fists underneath the flag (palms facing each other), thumbs on top, between the folded edges.  9.38.7.  (Step  3)  .  Fold  supports  the  flag  with  both  hands  underneath  (palms  up)  until  it  is completely  unfolded  by  NPB.    Fold  takes  the  end  of  the  flag  with  their  left  hand,  and  the other hand is grasping the flag, and NPB takes the folded corner of the flag with their right hand, placing their left hand underneath the flag (palm up).  340 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 9.94.  Flag Unfolded.   9.38.8.  Fold has their left index finger underneath the corner “flap” of the flag.  9.38.9.  NPB, Mark, and Carry pull their support hands out (that are underneath the flag) in sync  with  Mark.  NOTE:    Mark  will  start  to  pull  their  hand  out  once  all  movement  has stopped.  The flag is now at a “Quarter fold”  9.38.10.  NPB slightly tugs the flag once with their right hand and the pallbearers perform the following simultaneously:  9.38.11.  All heads drop to a 45 degree angle.  NPB side “flares” the inside hand and brings it across the flag to the outside hand of the person across from them (three-second place) and grabs the flag.(Mark uses the same hand as Carry)  Fold  side releases  folded-over  corner of the flag to NPB side and supports the flag with the inside hand until the flag has been secured by those on the NPB side.  9.39.  Re-Fold.    The command to re-fold a poorly folded flag is  given by Handoff or NPB (or OIC/NCOIC).    The  command  to  re-fold  the  flag  is,  RE-FOLD.  This  command  is  subdued.  If necessary  (if  NPB  calls  for  a  Re-Fold)  the  team  will  perform  the  Pass  Down  sequence.  Then perform  the  Break  Down  sequence.  If  Handoff  calls  “Re-fold,”  then  Handoff  will  begin  the Break  Down  sequence.  The  breakdown  of  the  flag  will  break  down  to  the  quarter-fold  only.  Then complete the Triangle fold sequence to re-fold the flag.  9.39.1.  A poorly folded flag is defined as any red/white showing, the white band exposed, or an overall unacceptable appearance.  9.40.  Presenting  the  Flag  to  the  NOK.    If there is no military chaplain, NPB executes a Full Dress Sequence of the flag and presents it to the OIC/NCOIC.  The OIC/NCOIC will take one side  step  to  their  left  at  the  same  time  NPB  executes  a  right  face  to  retrieve  the  flag.    The OIC/NCOIC receives the flag, left hand on top and the right hand on the bottom of the flag.  9.40.1.  Once  NPB  lowers  their  salute,  the  OIC/NCOIC  performs  a  three-second  facing movement in the appropriate direction of the NOK and then rotates the flag so that the point of the flag is facing towards them (point away from NOK).  All funeral elements remain at the position of attention.  The OIC/NCOIC then offers the flag to the NOK.  9.40.2.  The OIC/NCOIC steps to the NOK.  It is up to the OIC/NCOIC’s discretion whether to  kneel  on  one  knee  while  delivering  the  message  of  condolence,  however  they  should AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 341 always be at eye level to the NOK.  Upon the completion of the message of condolence, the OIC/NCOIC will return to the position of attention, take a half a step back, and render a final salute  while  looking  at  the  flag.    They  will  lower  the  salute,  return  to  the  foot  end  of  the casket and give the command of Bearers, POST.  9.41.  Presenting Multiple Flags.   The Duncan Hunter National Authorization Act for FY ’09, signed by President Bush on 14 October 2008, increased the number of authorized flag recipients at  military  funerals.    The  act  authorized  each  child  of  the  deceased  member  to  receive  a  flag.  Multiple flag presentations are only performed during funerals for the death of an AD member and group burials.  9.41.1.  Active Duty Deaths.  During these funerals, each flag to be handed off represents the individual  being  laid  to  rest.    Only  one  flag  will  be  folded  and  only  one  full  dress  will  be performed.  The flagbearers will not salute the flag when handing it over to the OIC/NCOIC or  Military  Chaplain  to  present  to  the  next  recipient.    Refer  to  Figure  A4.6.  for  sequence procedures and gravesite layout.  9.41.2.  Group  Burials.    During  group  burials  there  are  times  where  only  one  flag  will  be folded, however each flag representing each individual will at some point have touched the casket (this can be accomplished prior to the funeral service), will be full dressed and saluted after  handing  the  flag  to  the  OIC/NCOIC  or  Military  Chaplain.    Refer  to  Figure  A4.8.  for sequence procedures and gravesite layout.  Section 9F—Movement and Control of the Pallbearer Team 9.42.  Marching  and  Halting  the  Team.    Whenever  the  team  is  marching,  NPB  will  be  in command  of  the  team  regardless  whether  they  are  positioned  in  the  front  right  or  rear  left (inverted).  NOTE:    When  saluting  is  necessary.    NPB/Handoff,  whoever  is  leading,  will command “Ready Pin” on sequential feet starting on the right or left foot.  The foot on which the movement  starts  on  does  not  matter.    Ready  pinning,  is  to  be  executed  in  a  “three  count movement  performed  on  sequential  steps,  “Ready,  Pin,  Execute.”.   Of  NPB/Fold  or Handoff/Carry,  the  member  closest  to  the  item/person  requiring  the  salute,  will  temporarily suspend arm swing and perform an individual salute.  . Once ordered, both members will assume normal arm swing.  9.42.1.  During pre-ceremony positioning, NPB will always call Mark, TIME first and then Bearers,  HALT.  On HALT the team will perform an automatic facing movement towards the gravesite, hearse or COT, whatever is appropriate.  Section 9G—Implementation 9.43.  Pre-ceremony Preparation.  9.43.1.  NPB  will  inspect  the  gravesite  location  30-45  minutes  prior  to  ceremony  start  time (or  when  determined  by  OIC/NCOIC)  and  determine  the  positioning  of  the  hearse/caisson and the path of travel by the pallbearers.  9.43.2.  The pallbearer team will be in place at the gravesite or transfer point 20 minutes prior to  the  ceremony  start  time.    Pallbearers  will  conduct  warm-ups  by  running  through  the behind the hearse sequence, cremains retrieval and/or caisson sequences.  342 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.43.3.  OIC/NCOIC will ensure that all time lines are met and pre-ceremony preparation is completed prior to the ceremony.  9.43.4.  OIC/NCOIC  ensure  proper  and  appropriate  placement  of  buses,  firing  party  and band/escort, if applicable.  9.44.  Procession  Arrival.    Pallbearers  are  prepositioned  at  stand  at  ease,  awaiting  the  funeral procession.  Figure 9.95.  Procession Arrival.   9.44.1.  When the Chaplain’s vehicle approaches (if one is requested by family).  NPB will command  Bearers,  ATTENTION.    Whichever  pallbearer  is  closest  to  the  approaching vehicle will render a salute to the Chaplain (only if Chaplain is a military officer).  Once the vehicle has passed the team, NPB will give the command Stand At, EASE.  9.44.2.  When someone within the team notices that the procession is arriving, they notify the rest of team using the command, FAMILY.  9.44.3.  When  the  hearse  is  approximately  10  paces  away,  the  NPB  commands  Bearers, ATTENTION.  If there is no Chaplain present then OIC/NCOIC will take NPB’s command.  If there is  a military Chaplain then, OIC/NCOIC will command  Staff,  ATTENTION, only loud  enough  for  the  Chaplain  to  hear.    For  the  2/3  person  funeral  NCOIC  will  use  the command Staff, ATTENTION to command him/herself and Fold to attention.  9.44.4.  As the hearse passes in front of the team, Carry or Handoff (whoever is closest to the route  of  the  hearse)  will  render  a  three  second  hand  salute.  NOTE:    In  case  the  funeral representative/director does not stop the funeral procession, Handoff or Carry (whoever is on the  corner  of  the  team  closest  to  the  approaching  vehicles)  will  use  their  outside  hand  to signal the vehicles to stop before they impede the pallbearers route.    9.44.5.  OIC/NCOIC will salute then lower the salute to signal the vehicle to stop.  9.44.6.  Once  the  procession  has  stopped  and  the  hearse  or  vehicle  is  in  park,  NPB  will command STEP.  This initiates the hang step to reposition the team behind the hearse.  If the hearse  or  vehicle  is  too  close  to  the  front  three  pallbearers  then  NPB  will  not  give  the command to flank, instead prior to the command of STEP they will command S-t-a-n-d-B-y-y-y,  STEP.    The  team  will  hang  step  forward  and  on  the  first  right  (left)  foot  NPB  will command MARCH and the team will complete the proper flank to the right (left).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 343 9.44.7.  Once the team has hang stepped, NPB will call Right (Left) Flank, MARCH at the appropriate time in order to position the team directly behind and in line with the hearse or vehicle.  After the flank the team will take three additional hang steps towards the hearse and halt with no heel clicks.  If the hearse or vehicle stops too close to the team (NPB and Fold) then  NPB  will  inform  the  team  they  will  only  take  one  hang  step  after  the  flank  and  stop.  This is accomplished by stating “one step and stop,” in a quiet tone.  The rest of the team will echo quietly.  After the team flanks they will only take one more hang step, instead of three, and  close.    NPB  will  command  Stand  At,  EASE.    (7-person  funeral):    After  the  flanking movement, the team will step off automatically with coordinated arm swing and proceed to perform the behind the hearse sequence.  For cremains retrieval, only NPB and Fold will step off  automatically,  the  rest  of  the  team  will  perform  the  normal  three  hand  steps  and  stops.  NPB and Fold  will begin marching forward with suspended on the left  foot, so if the flank was to the right then NPB and Fold will complete the hang step, extend the left foot and then begin  marching  towards  the  hearse.  NOTE:    Stand  At,  EASE  may  not  be  called  if  the OIC/NCOIC  is  at  the  position  of  attention.  If  OIC/NCOIC  is  at  the  position  of  Stand  At, EASE then NPB will call the team to Stand At, EASE.  9.44.8.  NPB  waits  for  the  OIC/NCOIC  to  snap  to  the  position  of  attention  and  say, SECURE.  Thus indicating the remains are ready to be transferred to gravesite.  9.45.  Escort to Gravesite during a Full Honors Funeral in ANC.  9.45.1.  When  the  Caisson  Sgt.  calls  Caisson,  Forward  HO,  NPB  commands  Bearers, ATTENTION.    When  the  caisson  is  approximately  10  to  12  paces  away,  NPB  commands STEP to initiate the pallbearers’ march to gravesite.  The team will close into a close interval formation, breaking the formation only when necessary to avoid horse droppings.  9.45.2.  All  members  will  maintain  the  strictest  military  bearing  during  the  march  out  of respect for the deceased honoree and their family.  Regardless of whether or not the family is following the team on foot or in their vehicles, conversations must be related to the funeral, quiet and kept to a minimum.  9.45.3.  During the march, uniform corrections (i.e. hat, gloves, blouse etc.) may be executed discretely without NPB’s permission.  To make corrections, pallbearers use their hand to the inside  of  the  formation,  suspending  the  outside  arm  (resume  normal  arm  swing  once correction  is  completed).    Be  aware  of  the  surroundings  before  making  corrections  (i.e. cameras, tourists etc.).  Figure 9.96.  Escort to Gravesite.   344 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 9.46.  Gravesite Departure.   After the OIC/NCOIC or Chaplain has recited condolences to the NOK and has returned to their position, OIC/NCOIC will quietly command Bearers, POST.  In ANC the OIC/NCOIC will wait till after the Arlington Lady has presented her items to the NOK.  9.46.1.  NPB gives the command Face, ME or Face, AWAY. NOTE:  During the 7-person funeral only Face, AWAY will be called so that Mark and Carry do not have to travel around NPB/NCOIC.  NPB/NCOIC’s move to the foot of the casket gives NPB/NCOIC the  ability  to  view  the  funeral  sequence  properly,  without  having  their  back  to  the family.  Figure 9.97.  Gravesite Departure.  9.46.2.  The team will face towards or away from NPB.  9.46.3.  Automatically,  step  off  with  the  left  foot  in  a  slow  cadence  with  suspended  arm swing.   Figure 9.98.  Tap Step.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 345 9.46.4.  Once the team has cleared the  gravesite, Handoff or NPB, whoever is in the rear of the  team  will  command  STEP  and  the  entire  team  will  take  one  more  slow  step  with suspended arm swing and on the next available step will pick up a normal marching cadence with coordinated arm swing.  9.46.5.  If on a platform the pallbearers will immediately begin a “tap step” to the edge of the platform.  The tap step is performed similar to a hang step; the team will tap the toe of the foot then place the heel down slightly forward of its original placement.  Lengthen or shorten steps  to  ensure  proper  distance  and  dress  is  maintained.    Once  you  reach  the  edge  of  the platform extend your leg out over the marching surface to signal the other pallbearer to step off the platform.  Only leave the platform when both members have “kicked out.”  Ensure to maintain  a  slow  cadence  and  gently  tap  the  toe  onto  the  platform  making  as  little  noise  as possible.    To  the  untrained  eye  this  movement  should  look  the  same  as  the  hang  step performed earlier in the ceremony.  9.46.6.  Once the last two members are off the platform, Handoff or NPB, whoever is in the rear of the formation, will command STEP as their heel contacts the ground.  The team will take one more step then begin a normal march with coordinated arm swing.  9.46.7.  If on a platform and the pallbearer team is performing the 7-person modified funeral then on the command  AWAY they will exaggerate the first count of the appropriate facing movement  and  step  off  the  side  of  their  respective  platform.    The  team  will  automatically step off with suspended arm swing and leave gravesite IAW paragraph 9.48.3.-9.48.4.  9.46.8.  On ME and after the pallbearers have passed the OIC/NCOIC, he/she will execute a three-count  about  face,  stepping  off  on  the  third  count  rather  than  closing,  in  step  with  the pallbearers.  9.46.9.  On AWAY, the OIC/NCOIC will take a side step away from the family and step off in step with the pallbearers.  If the team is on a platform, the OIC/NCOIC will pause until the team has stepped off the platforms, then he/she will march off with the pallbearers.  9.47.  Grave Site with  a Vault Lid.    The OIC/NCOIC and pallbearers execute the exact same procedures  as  a  Full/Standard  Honors  Sequence  for  the  arrival  of  the  Chaplain  (if  applies),  the hearse,  behind  the  hearse  sequence,  and  the  carrying  of  the  casket  until  the  team  approaches gravesite area.  9.47.1.  Ensure the flag is “flared up” on foot end. NOTE:  This can be done at the hearse or at gravesite.  9.47.2.  After  the  commands  HALT  and  CENTER  are  called  at  the  gravesite,  NPB  gives command POST and Handoff moves into position taking two side steps.  The first side step will be a 45-degree step facing the left rear corner of the casket; the next step will be directly behind the casket.  9.47.3.  NPB gives the subdued command of Ready, FLARE for Fold to flare the corner of the  flag  on  top  of  the  casket.  NOTE:    This  command  is  given  immediately  after  the  POST command. If NPB’s side is blocked then NPB will flare his end of the flag on the casket.  9.47.4.  Handoff  gives  the  command  of  STEP.  Upon  the  command,  all  members  take  one side step toward the gravesite with Handoff bringing head up sharply (head and eyes straight forward).  NPB  or  Fold  (whomever  is  on  the  opposite  end  of  the  lid)  continues  to  step  to 346 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 guide it on the gravesite.  The other members continue to guide the casket onto the lowering device  until  it  passes  them,  when  the  casket  passes  them  they  will  return  to  the  position  of attention. Handoff continues to step until NPB give the command of HALT when the casket is secured on the gravesite. NOTE:   Side steps will be single count. Example: One step, dead step. One step, dead step.  9.47.5.  After the casket is secured on to the gravesite, Handoff secures the Union side of the flag,  while  NPB  or  Fold  (whoever  stepped  to  guide  the  casket)  secures  the  stripes  side  of flag.  NOTE:    Ensure  that  the  Ready,  FLARE  command  is  given  to  help  NPB/Fold  secure flag.  9.47.6.  NPB/Fold  gives  command  of  STEP.  Handoff  and  NPB/Fold  step  back  towards  the other members, with Handoff taking single steps back and NPB/Fold taking single side steps toward the team. As the flag approaches, all members secure the flag at their corresponding positions.  When  Handoff  reaches  position  across  from  Carry,  take  side  steps  into  Handoff position and complete 3-second head drop.  9.47.7.  NPB  gives  command  of  Ready,  STEP.      All  members  will  execute  corresponding “1-3-5 or 2-4-6” side steps.  NPB and Fold  will take 1 or 2 side steps away  from  lowering device, Mark and Cross-mark will take 3 or 4 side steps, and Carry and Handoff will take 5 or  6  side  steps  away  from  the  lowering  device.  NOTE:    “1-3-5”  or  “2-4-6”  will  be determined  during  gravesite  check  before  start  of  funeral.  This  procedure  is  done to  ensure team has sufficient clearance of the lowering device or canopy.  9.47.8.  Handoff will click heels at completion of 5th or 6th step. Upon the completion of the side steps, members will complete 2 ½ folds and maintain flag in canoe.  9.47.9.  The normal six person flag fold sequence is then executed.  9.47.10.  OIC/NCOIC  will  follow  the  casket  to  gravesite  like  normal.  Then  step  to  the  side opposite  the  family  at  the  head  of  the  casket,  facing  the  family.  Once  the  pallbearers  have pulled the flag off the casket and taken their steps down, OIC/NCOIC will step between the flag and the casket and face down the flag. OIC/NCOIC will continue with regular ceremony requirements  from  this  point  on.  (7-person  funeral):  NPB  will  execute  a  right  face  on  the command Face, AWAY and reposition themselves at the foot of the casket. NPB will take a path  so they do not  cross between the family  and the casket.  If military  chaplain is  present they will stand off to the side of the OIC/NCOIC.  9.48.  Joint Service Pallbearer Teams.   Joint service pallbearer teams will only be used during Special Military, Official and State Funerals or other missions dictated by the Military District of Washington  or  DoD.    If  a  situation  arises  requiring  a  Base  Honor  Guard  to  assemble  a  joint pallbearer  team  then  they  must  contact  the  USAF  Honor  Guard  Standardization  &  Evaluation section prior to conducting any training or assignment of positions.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 347 Figure 9.99.  Joint Service Pallbearer Teams.    348 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Chapter 10 HONOR CORDONS  Section 10A—General Information 10.1.  Background.    A  cordon  refers  to  any  line  of  troops,  ships  etc.,  that  are  enclosing  or guarding an area to prevent passage.  They have existed in some form or another as long as man has fought battles and waged wars.  The more important the target, resource or leader was then the larger the cordon to protect it.  Honor Cordons, originated from this military necessity.  The modern day requirements for cordons are based off Gun Salutes (AFPAM 34-1202, Chapter 8).  10.2.  Protocol.    Honor  Cordons,  are  used  to  greet  military  and  government  officials.    Some examples  of  ceremonies  that  may  include  cordons  are,  Air  Force  Outdoor  Retirements  for General Officers, Change of Command Ceremonies and Flight line Arrivals.  Strict adherence to AFI 34-1201 is mandatory for all Airmen.  In order to give the appropriate respect and honors to the individual, cordon members must render the hand salute or present arms with a rifle.  Swords and  sabers  cannot  be  used.  NOTE:    Honor  Cordons  for  visiting  dignitaries  are  not  authorized unless it is part of the Air Force CSAF’s Counterpart Program taking place in Washington DC.  Installations  must  be  ordered  by  the  HAF/CVAI  to  conduct  an  arrival  ceremony  for  visiting foreign dignitaries. EXCEPTION:  During a wreath  laying in  honor of a late POTUS an honor cordon of 21 members is still authorized.  10.2.1.  Cordon Sizes (including commander):  10.2.1.1.  POTUS/Former POTUS, 21 members.  10.2.1.2.  Vice-President, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff/ Air Force Chief of Staff, 19 members.  10.2.1.3.  4-Star General, 17 members.  10.2.1.4.  3-Star General, 15 members.  10.2.1.5.  2-Star General, 13 members.  10.2.1.6.  1-Star General, 11 members.  10.2.1.7.  Refer to AFI 34-1201 Attachment 2 for further guidance  10.3.  Requirements.  10.3.1.  Cordons  will  only  be  used  when  required  by  the  ceremony  and  if  manning  can  be supported.    Refer  to  AFPAM  34-1202,  paragraph  12.5.4.  and  AFI  34-1201,  paragraphs 11.23., Chapter 12 and Attachment 2.  10.3.2.  Honor  guards  and/or  Wings/MAJCOMs should  develop  guidance/policy  on  the  use of  cordons/honors  for  distinguished  persons.    For  example  the  Air  Force  District  of Washington  dictates  that  the  USAF  Honor  Guard  may  only  perform  honor  cordons  for General/Admiral (1-star) officers and above.  10.3.3.  Sabers or swords will never be used for an honor cordon and the commander of the cordon will not carry a saber/sword.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 349 10.3.4.  Honor cordons will never be used for individuals not authorized the honor. Examples include  but  are  not  limited  to,  any  enlisted  person,  aides/representatives  of  individuals authorized honors, award nominees, groups of individuals.  10.3.5.  Honors will only be accorded to an individual.  10.3.6.  Never provide more or less cordon members then what is required. EXCEPTION:  In extremely rare circumstances it may be necessary to reduce the number of personnel due to logistics.    Currently,  the  only  situation  that  this  is  authorized  is  during  an  Air  Force  Full Honors Wreath Laying at the TUS.  Never increase the number of personnel beyond what is authorized for the individual.  10.3.7.  Honor  cordons  for  arrival/departure  ceremonies  are  not  performed  between  Retreat and Reveille, on Sundays, or on national holidays (except Armed Forces and Independence Day),  unless  the  officer  directing  the  honors  believes  the  occasion  requires  an  exception (AFPAM 34-1202, paragraph 12.5.4.2.). EXCEPTION:  The POTUS is always accorded full honors.  10.3.8.  The height of the team members will be as closely matched as possible.  As a rule of thumb there should not be more than a four inch height difference between the shortest and tallest members.  Smaller cordons may require an even smaller height disparity.  10.3.9.  The  cordon’s  dress  and  cover  will  be  perfect  from  the  distinguished  person’s viewpoints.  10.3.10.  Objects, personnel, rifles will never be placed in between the cordon as to create a potential  tripping  hazard  for  distinguished  visitors.    This  is  another  reason  why  cordon members  cannot  be  armed  with  sabers/swords;  if  a  proper  salute  is  executed  with  a saber/sword it would place the blade in the distinguished visitor’s path of travel.  Do not use method  one  of  trail  arms  (paragraph  2.15.1.)  when  performing  facing  movements  or returning to the position of attention.  10.3.11.  All Airmen must adhere to the guidance outlined in this chapter.  10.3.12.  Cordon members will hold their salute until the distinguished person and their PC, if applicable; have passed completely through the cordon.  10.4.  Composition and Formation.   The cordon is formed in two equal lines.  Figure 10.1.  Air Force Cordon.   350 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 10.4.1.  The  tallest  individuals  will  be  positioned  closest  to  distinguished  person’s  starting point so that they are the first cordon members to be seen by the distinguished person.  10.4.2.  If  a  cordon  consists  of  members  from  different  services  or  nations  ensure  that  they are in the proper order.  The correct order of precedence for the U.S. Armed Forces is Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force and Coast Guard.  If there are service members from other nations’ military then place members using the same guidance that applies to the flags of the countries participating in the ceremony.  To form cordons according to precedence begin with the two tallest individuals; from there the next two tallest members will be 2nd in precedence and so forth.  Cordon members will always be across from someone of the same service.  Figure 10.2.  Joint Service Cordons at the Pentagon.  10.4.3.  The two files should be far enough apart so at least two individuals walking side by side can pass through comfortably.  Intervals between members are situational.  Commanders will use their best  judgment taking into account aesthetics, team members’ abilities to  lock on and/or hear the commands given.  10.4.4.  The Commander of the Cordon is  called  the OIC or NCOIC of Cordon (O/NCOR) and should be positioned on the outside of either file and centered.   10.5.  Responsibilities.  10.5.1.  Members.    Each member of the cordon is responsible for meeting and maintaining the prescribed standards in this manual and all applicable standards of safety and conduct.  10.5.1.1.

Leads  the  cordon  and  is  responsible  for  the  accountability,  conduct, safety and performance of the cordon under his/her direction.  The O/NCOR will be an NCO.  10.5.2.1.  Possess extensive drill, ceremony and protocol knowledge.  10.5.2.2.  Replace  any  Cordon  member  if  they  do  not  possess  the  necessary  training  to perform assigned duties.  10.5.2.3.  Ensure the correct placement and spacing of the cordon.  10.5.2.4.  Ensure  the  correct  number  of  individuals  is  assigned  to  the  cordon  and  that honors are accorded correctly/appropriately.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 351 10.5.2.5.  Place  marks  using  tape  or  chalk  at  the  appropriate  locations  prior  to  the ceremony.  10.5.2.6.  Ensure the cordon is dressed and covered properly.  10.6.  Equipment.  10.6.1.  The correct number of bayonets, if applicable, and rifles with white/black slings.  10.6.2.  White/black gloves.  10.6.3.  Ceremonial belts.  10.6.4.

Replica/mock  rifles  should  be  avoided.  Honor  guards  will  make  every  attempt  to  acquire  and utilize functional weapons, whether inert or operational.  Refer to figures 2.14., 4.1. and 7.5. for rifle nomenclatures.  10.7.1.  In a deployed/forward operating location where no ceremonial weapons are available the M4 or M16 will only be used as a last resort, and only while performing ceremonies in the prescribed utility uniforms.  10.7.2.  Cordon  members  are  authorized  to  carry  a  sidearm  (i.e.  M9  pistol  or  .38  caliber revolver) in a black patent leather holster if no rifles are available.  It is also authorized for cordon members to be unarmed.  10.7.3.  Weapons  will  not  be  carried  on  cordons  taking  place  inside  a  church  or  place  of worship or as directed by leadership based on unique situations/circumstances.  10.7.4.  Cordon members will never be armed with sabers/swords.  10.7.5.  If the resources are available, weapons will be fixed with bayonets.  10.7.6.  If  the  cordon  consists  of  members  from  multiple  services  or  nations  then  each service/nation may carry the standard rifle for their respective service/country.  Figure 10.3.  Joint Service Cordon inside the National Cathedral.   352 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 10.8.  Uniform  Requirements.    All  cordon  members  will  wear  the  ceremonial  belt.

Sword  and  saber  arches  (figure  11.1.)  are  unique  ceremonies  that originated  in  England,  although  are  mostly  an  American  custom.    The  ceremonies  evolved beginning  with  either  the  Army  or  Marine  Corps  and  are  most  commonly  associated  with military weddings.  The Air Force procedures are loosely based on the Army’s traditions.  The arches performed during weddings are a symbolic pledge of loyalty to the newly married couple from their Air Force family.  Figure 11.1.  Sword Arch.   11.2.  Protocol.   The intent of a saber/sword arch falls in line with the Air Force’s purpose and definition  of  “ceremonies”  and  is  outlined  AFMAN  36-2203  section  7.1.    In  addition  the saber/sword arch is designed to add military professionalism and décor to an event.  Saber/sword arches can be used for a variety of ceremonies that recognize multiple individuals equally who are typically not authorized a cordon.  Some examples of ceremonies where it is appropriate to use a saber/sword arch are PME graduations, awards banquets and weddings, although weddings are not considered official Air Force ceremonies.  11.2.1.  Saber/sword arches may also be used to honor an individual that is not authorized an honor cordon or military honors.  11.2.2.  Only Officers and NCOs are authorized a saber/sword arch at their wedding.  11.2.3.  During weddings, only the newly married couple is allowed to pass under the arch.  11.2.4.  Junior enlisted personnel are not authorized saber/sword arches unless they are being recognized with a group of individuals, i.e. graduations and awards ceremonies.  11.3.  Requirements.  11.3.1.  Although a saber/sword arch is essentially a cordon it should not be confused with an Honor  Cordon  and  will  never  be  used  in  lieu  of.    Forming  the  saber/sword  arch  and/or 356 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 extending the arm and saber/sword upward at  a  45-degree angle is  not  a salute of any kind and should never be used when a salute is more appropriate.  11.3.2.  All  saber/sword  movements  and  requirements  outlined  in  Chapter  5  of  this  manual will be adhered to at all times.  11.3.3.  The cordon’s dress and cover will be perfect from the honorees’ viewpoints.  11.3.4.

Composition and Formation.   The team will be comprised of either nine Officers or nine NCOs and will be formed in two equal lines.  If space is limited then the number of personnel utilized  will  be  reduced.    The  size  of  the  team  will  never  exceed  nine  (including  the OIC/NCOIC) (figure 11.2.).  11.4.1.  The  tallest  individuals  will  be  positioned  closest  to  honorees’  starting  point  so  that they are the first members to be seen.  11.4.2.  The team will only be comprised of members of the Air Force due to the differences in service customs and the intent of the ceremony.  11.4.3.  The distance between the two elements depends on the available room.  The distance between the members of each element is at least an arm length distance and should be at least adequate for those who are walking through the cordon to pass safely  11.4.4.  The  OIC/NCOIC  should  be  positioned  on  the  outside  of  either  file  and  centered (figure 11.2.).  Figure 11.2.  Sword Cordon.  11.5.  Responsibilities.   11.5.1.  Members.

The definition of proffer is simply  any item that is  held out/presented for consideration or offering.   In the military the term  itself has come to  describe the individual at many ceremonies who hands items to official party members in order to be awarded.  Although the member is performing the act of proffering the correct title for their position is awards bearer, flower bearer or wreath bearer, depending on the items to be proffered.  13.1.1.  Wreaths have existed in many forms since ancient times and most likely originated in southern Europe.  The use of wreaths for funerals and memorials has been around for nearly as long and began as a Christian tradition.  The various meanings and symbolism of flowers and wreaths have allowed this custom to evolve; and today, wreaths are used by people of all backgrounds  to  memorialize  loved  ones.    Wreaths  are  commonly  placed  at  graves,  tombs, cenotaphs and monuments/memorials.  13.2.  Protocol.   All awards/flower bearers should approach the host on their right side.  13.2.1.  Bearers must render all proper customs and courtesies.  13.2.2.  Proffers/awards bearers are NOT to present gifts to hosts/guests/family members.  13.3.  Requirements.  13.3.1.  Bearers should make every effort to not turn their back to the audience.  If necessary bearers will perform the three-count about face turning to their left first.  To do this, perform the movement as follows only while performing as a solitary member:  13.3.1.1.  (Count  1)  .  Lift the right foot just enough to clear the ground and place it in front (perpendicular) of the left foot forming a "T" with both feet, bend the knees slightly.  13.3.1.2.  (Count 2)  . The position of the right foot is not changed; lift the left foot just high  enough  to  clear  the  ground  and  pivot  180-degrees,  bring  the  corners  of  the  heels together to form a 90-degree angle (an "L").  Step off with the right foot.  13.3.2.  If the shape of the item permits, all items will be carried IAW paragraph 9.27. (figure 13.1.).  366 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 13.1.  Award Bearer.   13.3.3.  Flowers and bouquets will be carried with the bulbs in front of the right shoulder and the stems in the left hand.  The left hand will grip the stems at a fist.  Keep the flowers close to the body.  The right forearm should be parallel to the ground (figure 13.2.), although slight adjustments may be made depending on the flower arrangement.  The flowers are supported with a cup hand or by cradling the flowers with the right forearm.  Figure 13.2.  Flower Bearer.   13.3.4.  Wreaths  will  be carried  as  if  holding  a  rifle  at  present  arms.    The  left  hand  will  be gripping the stand/holder at a fist while the right hand is flared and flush with the middle of the stand/holder.  If the wreath’s weight or stand/holder does not permit this method of carry then the bearer will adjust accordingly, preferably holding the stand with both hands at a fist and  together/touching.    Wreaths  that  do  not  have  a  frame  will  be  carried  by  grabbing  the outside  of  the  wreath  with  forearms  parallel  to  the  ground;  every  effort  will  be  made  to prevent the wreath bearer’s hands from being exposed.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 367 Figure 13.3.  Wreath Bearer.   13.3.5.  Wreath bearers will present and order arms around the wreath rather than following up  the  center-line  of  the  body.    If  carrying  a  wreath  without  an  attached  frame  then  the wreath bearer will not render the hand salute.  13.3.6.  Awards/flower bearers will never heel click. Wreath bearers will only heel click on the following occasions (for a total of five heel clicks); when halting and facing to present the wreath to the host, when facing after the host has returned to their position and when halting and performing a two-count about face to signal the band.  13.4.

Background.    Ceremonies  can  often  contain  numerous  moving  pieces  and  elements  to them.    Orchestrating  the  multiple  elements  while  moving  the  official  party,  audience,  and/or guests from  point A to  point B in  an organized fashion requires a plan.   To aid  in  producing a smooth flowing event from pre-ceremony to post-ceremony, honor guards are typically used to perform usher duties.  14.1.1.  The term  usher has several  different  meanings.  The most common definitions, and the  ones  that  apply  to  this  publication,  are:    a  person  who  escorts  people  to  their  seats,  a person  acting  as  an  official  doorkeeper  or  an  officer  who  is  leading  a  person  of  rank ceremonially.      An  usher  encompasses  all  the  miscellaneous  positions  performed  by  honor guards worldwide.  14.1.2.  The usher position is broken down into six categories:  Chaplain Assistant, Official Party  Briefer/Escort,  Guest  Escort,  Doorkeeper  (more  commonly  referred  to  as  a  “Door Opener”), Sentinel and Traffic.  14.2.  Protocol.  14.2.1.  Ushers must render all proper customs and courtesies.  14.2.2.  Ushers will ensure guests exit vehicles, are escorted, seated and enter vehicles in the correct  fashion  based  on  the  needs  of  the  ceremony  and  proper  protocol,  customs  and courtesies.  14.2.3.  Refer to AFPAM 34-1202, paragraph 8.7. for clarification on “Positions of Honor.”  14.2.4.  Use  AFI  34-1201  and  AFPAM  34-1202  for  guidance  regarding  DV  seating, precedence, ceremony sequences and any other protocol requirements.  14.3.  Requirements.  14.3.1.  When  escorting  a  ranking  individual  or  in  situations  that  will  not  require  the uniformed  member  to  salute  (such  as  indoor  ceremonies),  ensure  that  the  guest  is  in  the position of honor (to the right of the escort).  14.3.2.  Place the ranking guest/individual to the escort’s left when it will be required for the unformed escort to salute, i.e. when performing as Chaplain’s Assistant, the Arlington Lady will always be on the assistant’s left.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 373 Figure 14.1.  Guest Escort.   14.3.3.  Ensure  uniformity  amongst  Guest  Escorts  throughout  the  ceremony.    The  guests should be escorted on the same side of all escorts throughout the ceremony.  14.3.4.  Males escorting female guests should allow the female to hold their arm as the guest is led to her seat (Figure 14.2.).  Male escorts should ensure female guests are seated before releasing their arm.  Males and females escorting male guests will simply “guide” the guests to their seats.  Figure 14.2.  Guest in the Position of Honor.   14.3.5.  Guest  Escorts  should  introduce  themselves,  be  friendly  and  engage  in  polite conversation while escorting guests to their seats.  374 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 14.3.6.  Guest  Escorts  may  be  tasked  to  assist  individuals  with  mobility  challenges  or  in wheel chairs.  Guest Escorts may also assist with umbrellas, act as “runners” or various other tasks, as required.  14.3.7.  Doorkeepers  will  open/close  doors  in  sync  with  each  other.    Doorkeepers  will maintain strict military bearing.  Movements will be disciplined and strict but not “robotic.”  Make every effort to only move the foot/leg closest to the door.  The arm closest to the door will be used to open/close the door, the other arm remains at the proper position of attention.  14.3.8.  The Official  Party  Briefer/Escort  will always march in  front  of the official party to lead them to their seats (figure 14.3.).  Figure 14.3.  Escorting the Official Party to their Seats during an “Outdoor” Ceremony.   14.3.9.  The Official Party Briefer/Escort will maintain strict military bearing while escorting the official party (figure 14.3.).  Once at their seats, ensure that the official party is seated in the correct positions.  Using a hand gesture to motion to the correct seat is preferred.  14.3.10.  Traffic  will  always  heel  click  when  performing  facing  movements  and  coming  to attention. The audible click acts as a signal/cue for the COT and formation.  14.3.11.  Traffic points the direction of travel by facing/halting in front of the COT.  At the same time bring the left or right arm four inches away and in front of the abdomen with the forearm parallel to the ground.  The hand is at a proper flare (figure 14.4.).  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 375 Figure 14.4.  Traffic Pointing the Direction of Travel for the COT at a FHF.   14.4.  Responsibilities.  14.4.1.

DRESS AND APPEARANCE  Chapter 15 GROOMING AND APPEARANCE STANDARDS  Section 15A—General Information 15.1.  Basic Philosophy.   The ceremonial guardsman is an individual of good reputation having integrity, ethical conduct and exhibiting standards which merit respect; responsible for protecting and overseeing the maintenance of standards on and off duty.  The corner stone to this reputation is  outstanding  dress  and  appearance.    Honor  guard  personnel  must  exceed  the  Air  Force standards and present a flawless image to the public.  15.1.1.  There will be numerous occasions in which the only interaction one may have with the U.S. Air Force is with an Air Force honor guard.  We must ensure that this interaction is positive.    The  task  of  representing  every  member  past  and  present  is  an  honor  that  few perform;  the  image  portrayed  by  members  of  the  honor  guard  must  be  one  of  that  instills confidence and pride in our service and country.  15.1.2.  An  Air  Force  honor  guard  is  an  “icon  of  excellence;”  they  represent  the  U.S.  Air Force to the American public and the world.  They do not represent themselves and as such nametags  are  never  worn  as  part  of  any  ceremonial  uniform  combination.    “Nameless  and Selfless Service” is the mantra lived by Air Force honor guards.  15.1.3.  The intent and vision is for all ceremonial guardsmen, regardless of location, to meet the same standards of dress and appearance.  The ceremonial uniform was created so that all honor guards wear the same standardized uniform.  15.1.3.1.  Differences in the Base Honor Guard and the USAF Honor Guard ceremonial uniforms exist due to cost saving measures to enable installations worldwide to purchase and wear the ceremonial uniform.  Restricting the ceremonial uniform to only the USAF Honor Guard would create supply and demand issues, thus raising the cost of these items and creating a burden for the squadron.  It would also go against the intent and vision of the uniform.  15.1.3.2.  Other  differences  such  as  full  sized  medals  and  white  shirts  exist  based  on Military  District  of  Washington,  Joint  Service  and  Arlington  National  Cemetery requirements.  15.2.  Enforceability.    USAF Honor Guard personnel will adhere to all Dress and Appearance standards  and  guidance  outlined  in  this  manual.    Base  Honor  Guard  personnel  are  required  to adhere to the standards outlined in Chapter 15 only when wearing the ceremonial and informal uniforms  or  when  directed  otherwise,  e.g.,  Airman  Battle  Uniforms  (ABU)  are  configured  to meet  honor  guard  standards  with  cheaters  on  boots,  specific  uniform  and  equipment requirements  outlined  in  Part  2  of  this  manual,  etc.    Adherence  to  Chapters  17,  18  and  20  are optional for Base Honor Guard personnel.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 379 Section 15B—Hair Grooming Standards 15.3.  General.    Base  Honor  Guard  personnel  will  adhere  to  the  standards  in  AFI  36-2903, Chapter 3.

While in uniform, bangs will not extend past the hatband.  Short hair will be pinned back behind the ears to prevent hair from protruding out of the front of the hat. If artificially colored, it must look natural and compliment the individual.  Hair ornaments such as scrunches, gold or silver barrettes, and visible grooming aides  detract  from  acceptable  honor  guard  image  and  will  not  be  worn.    Hairpieces  are  not authorized unless approved by medical personnel for disfiguration or baldness and must conform to  the  same  standards  as  stipulated  herein  for  natural  hair.    Hairstyle  (bulk  of  hair)  must  not exceed three inches or prevent wearing of the ceremonial hat.  Long hair will be put into a sock bun at the nape of the neck and covered with a hair net in all uniform combinations. Short hair that  cannot  be  put  into  a  sock  bun  will  not  extend  past  the  top  of  the  collar.  The  hairnet  and ponytail holder will be of the same color as the hair.  Hair must be cut and/or styled as often as necessary  in  order  to  conform  to  these  standards.  NOTE:    The  only  authorized  style  braid  for females  hair  is  a  single  braid  wrapped  around  the  bun.    Twisting  of  hair  is  not  authorized. EXCEPTION:    Micro-braids  are  authorized  provided  all  other  requirements  outlined  in paragraph 15.4. are met.  Figure 15.1.  Properly Groomed Hair for Honor Guard Females.  15.5.  Males.    Sideburns are prohibited.  The length  of hair is  prescribed  as follows:   The hair will  be  neatly  trimmed  and  cut  close  (i.e.  clean  shaven/skin)  around  the  back  and  sides  of  the head  at  all  times;  graduating  to  no  more  than  1/2-inch  where  the  hair  lays  under  the  hatband.  Hair above the hatband will not exceed 1 1/4-inch in bulk.   380 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 15.5.1.  Male  personnel  assigned  to  the  USAF  Honor  Guard  will  have  a  fresh  haircut,  at  a minimum  of  twice  a  week,  and  as  often  as  necessary  (White  House  ceremonies  and  other high-level  ceremonies  as  directed  by  squadron  leadership)  in  order  to  maintain  a  neat  and clean-cut appearance.  15.5.2.  Neck/body hair will not protrude from the collar of the short/long-sleeved blue shirt or  the  ceremonial  white  shirt.    USAF  Honor  Guard  personnel  will  be  inspected  at  every formation to ensure standards are being met.  Hair will not be bleached or dyed any unnatural color.  15.6.  Beards,  Mustaches,  and  Goatees.    Facial  hair  is  not  authorized.   All  personnel  will  be clean-shaven at all times.  Individuals receiving temporary shaving waivers will not be used on ceremonial commitments unless the waiver specifically states the specified individual can shave every other day in order to perform on ceremonies.  Individuals with shaving waivers extending beyond  30  calendar  days  or  recurring  waivers  will  be  relieved  of  duty  and  evaluated  for reassignment or returned to primary duty sections.  Figure 15.2.  Properly Groomed Hair for Honor Guard Males.  15.7.  Fingernails.    Males:    Will  be  trimmed  short,  no  longer  than  1/8-inch,  and  clean  at  all times.    Females:    Will  be  neatly  trimmed  to  no  longer  than  1/4-inch  (natural  or  artificial)  and clean  at  all  times.    Ornamentation  of  fingernails  while  in  uniform  is  strictly  prohibited.    Nail polish of any color is not authorized. EXCEPTION:  French style manicures with white tips and clear nail polish.   Section 15C—Equipment, Accessories and Miscellaneous Standards 15.8.  Body Piercings.   Females will not wear earrings while in the ceremonial uniform.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 381 15.9.  Tattoos/Brands.    All  honor  guard  personnel  must  refrain  from  acquiring  body  art  that may  become  exposed  during  ceremonies  or  public  events.    Members  will  be  screened accordingly  prior  to  assignment  with  the  unit.    Individuals  who  obtain  such  body  art  will  be barred from ceremonial duties or even transferred from the unit.  In addition, tattoos/brands will not be visible through the uniform.  15.10.  Cosmetics.    Cosmetics  must  be  more  conservative  than  what  is  normally  expected  of female Airmen.  Excessive or bright cosmetics and lipstick draws attention to the individual and can detract from the ceremony.  15.11.  Tobacco  and  Alcohol  Use  in  Uniform.    The purchase and use of tobacco and alcohol products  is  prohibited  at  all  times  while  in  the  ceremonial  uniform.    Tobacco  products  include cigarettes, dip, etc.  Tobacco use in the Air Force is outlined in AFI 40-102.  15.12.  Hearing Protection.   When hearing protection is required to be worn in the ceremonial uniform  only  flesh  colored,  transparent  or  blue  earplugs  will  be  worn.    All  members  in  the formation must wear the same style and color of earplugs.  15.13.  Wear of Glasses in Uniform.    The wear of prescription eyeglasses is authorized while in  service/dress  blues,  ABU  and  PTU  combinations  IAW  36-2903.    While  in  the  ceremonials, eyeglasses,  sunglasses  and  photosensitive  lenses,  are  only  authorized  when  wearing  the lightweight blue jacket.  15.13.1.  The  wear  of  sunglasses  while  in  the  USAF  Honor  Guard  ceremonial  uniform  is authorized only to members of the USAF Honor Guard Drill Team during drill performances and  rehearsals.    Drill  Team  members  will  wear  the  standard  issue  small  silver  rimmed military style aviator sunglasses.  If glasses become lost or damaged, members are required to  purchase  a  new  pair  through  Military  Clothing  Sales.    Glasses  will  not  be  modified  in appearance, but may be bent in order to better fit the face.  15.14.  Wear of Jewelry.    Members will not wear rings, watches or jewelry of any kind in the ceremonial  uniform  (all  combinations  to  include  the  lightweight  jacket).    However,  there  are some exceptions.  If married, members are authorized to wear their wedding ring/band.  Watches are  only  authorized  for  key  leaders  that  require  them  during  ceremonies  (i.e.  COT  on  a  FHF).  Care should be taken to only wear a watch if it is absolutely necessary.  If worn, the watch will be  placed  on  the  left  arm,  above  the  wrist  to  prevent  it  from  being  seen.    Only  solid  black  or silver, small, conservative watches will be worn.  15.15.  Rifle  Stocks.    Rifle stocks used during ceremonies will be made of wood and maintain the natural appearance of the wood type and grain.  Stocks used by honor guards should be made from walnut or birch wood.  Select the wood type based on the needs of the team.  15.15.1.  Stocks  made  from  composite  materials  or  plastic  will  only  be  used  for  training purposes.  15.15.2.  All rifle stocks will be free of nicks, scratches and defects.  Upon receiving a new rifle  stock,  individuals  are  required  to  remove  all  manufacture  logos  and  stamps,  as applicable.  Begin sanding by utilizing a low grit sandpaper (60 grit).  Finish using a high grit sandpaper (400-800 grit) to ensure a smooth feel and appearance.  15.15.3.  The  color  of  the  rifle  stocks  will  range  from  medium  to  dark  and  be  uniform  in appearance.  Depending on the rifle's wood type, individuals will need to apply either wood 382 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 stain, and/or gun stock finish, (Polyurethane or similar product).  Stocks made of walnut are naturally  darker  and  will  only  require  the  application  of  gun  stock  finish.    Stocks  made  of birch  wood  will  be  a  lighter,  blonde  color,  and  will  require  both  wood  stain  and  gun  stock finish.  Stain colors should be limited to American Walnut, Dark Walnut or Special Walnut..  15.15.4.  When applying wood stain, individuals will apply the amount of stain necessary to obtain a medium to dark color.  Both gun stock finish and stains will be applied in thin even coats, while maintaining the stock's natural appearance and grain.  Multiple coats of each will be applied in order to give the stock a streak and drip free, shined/mirrored appearance.  15.15.5.  All  rifle  stocks  must  be  properly  cared  for  and  maintained  in  order  to  constantly meet standards.  15.16.  Rifle  Slings.    The white and black slings will be clean, serviceable and free of strings. White slings will be used when performing with white gloves and when dictated by Joint Service ceremonies;  black  slings  with  black  gloves.  Green  or  blue  slings  may  be  used  only  during training. The sling will have a four-finger width (3-inches) between the spring clip and buckle, and between the buckle and keeper. This distance will place the keeper directly over the trigger. Ensure that the sling is placed through the sling swivels.  Ensure the sling is taut.  Do not place the sling through the stacking swivel (the highest swivel, located at the very top of the forward hand guard) on the M1 Rifle. When secured to a weapon, the excess material may be taped flush to the sling. White tape may be used on white slings; black tape on black slings. Slings may be cut to size to fit the weapon, however, the chrome tip is mandatory and must be in serviceable condition. If the sling is past the buckle when the keeper and buckle are properly placed, cut the sling  so  that  the  end  is  approximately  at  the  buckle  (three  inches  past  keeper)  and  reaffix  the sling  tip  to  the  sling.  NOTE:    Use  caution  when  sizing.    Slings  may  shrink  when  washed.  Additionally,  the  various  weapon  models  have  different  swivel  locations,  however  slings  sized correctly will fit all weapon types correctly.  Figure 15.3.  Rifle Slings Properly Affixed to Sling Swivels.   AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 383 15.17.  Transitioning  Personnel.    Members  who  are  attending  technical  training  school  for retraining  must  maintain  all  honor  guard  dress  and  appearance  standards  while  TDY,  unless otherwise instructed by the installation and/or technical training guidance.  Boots with cheaters will not be worn while attending technical training or PME.

It  is  mandatory that an ironing cover be used when ironing the blouse, pants, overcoat, all-weather coat and light weight  blue  jacket.    Ironing  without  an  iron  cover  may  cause  burns  or  holes  in  the  uniform.  Steaming the ceremonial uniform is encouraged but will not be the sole method of upkeep of the uniform.  NOTE:      Burns  in  the  ceremonial  uniform  cause  the  uniform  to  be  unserviceable  and must be repaired and/or replaced.  All buttons on the uniform must be maintained.  16.3.  Official  Photos.    The  ceremonial  uniform  is  never  used  in  lieu  of  the  Service  Dress uniform  for  official  photos.

For  females,  the badge will be worn on the right side, centered between the arm seam and lapel, with the bottom  edge  of  the  badge  parallel  to  the  top  of  the  welt  pocket.    For  males,  a  second badge will be worn on the right side, in the same relative position as the badge on the left.  A third badge will be worn above the second with the bottom edge of the badge parallel to the top of the welt pocket.  For females, a second duty badge will be worn to the left of,  centered  and  1/2-inch  apart  from  the  first  badge.  NOTE:      Affix  the  Senior  Badge attachment upon reaching the Senior-tier and the Master Badge attachment upon reaching the  Master-tier  and  eight  years  of  cumulative  experience  as  an  Air  Force  honor  guard.  Refer to the 8G000 CFETP for award criteria and requirements.  16.6.7.  Base Honor Guard Duty Badge.    (Base Honor Guard Only).  The badge is a unit identifier as a member of the Base Honor Guard team.  Current members of each individual Base  Honor  Guard  team  are  authorized  to  wear  the  badge.    Former  members,  no  longer assigned  to  the  Base  Honor  Guard  are  not  authorized.    If  a  team  operates  on  a  rotation system,  member’s  off-rotation,  but  still  assigned  to  Base  Honor  Guard,  are  considered current  members.    Each  base  should  implement  criteria  for  awarding  the  badge.    However, each team member must earn their badge before performing in any ceremony.  For example, awarding  the  badge  upon  completion  of  a  one-week  course  conducted  by  the  Base  Honor Guard.  The badge must be worn on the ceremonial blouse and blues shirt when in summer uniform.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 387 16.6.7.1.  Badges will be worn IAW 36-2903. Males will wear badge on the left side an inch  and  a  half  down  from  the  top  of  the  welt  of  the  pocket  under  the  ribbons  and centered, unless they have a primary badge, e.g., security forces, missile, fire fighter, etc. In  this  case,  wearer  should  wear  the  ceremonial  badge  on  the  right  side  in  the  same relative position as the badge on the left.  16.6.7.2.  Females  will  wear  badge  on  the  right  side  with  the  bottom  part  of  the  badge lined up with the top of the welt of the pocket and centered where the nametag would be if worn in  Service dress  blues.   If another primary  badge is  worn on the  right  side e.g., OSD, etc. then the second badge will be centered and spaced ½ inch apart from the first badge. NOTE:   If members possess additional duty badges ensure that they are following the guidance listed in AFI 36-2903.  The ceremonial uniform typically follows the same guidance for badge placement as the Semi-Formal and Mess Dress uniforms.  16.6.8.  Full  Sized  Anodized  Medals.    (USAF  Honor  Guard  Only).    Medals  will  be fabricated  by  USAF  Honor  Guard  Supply  personnel.    The  ribbon  will  be  given  a  taut appearance by securing a plastic backing to the material that will be 1 and ¾ inches in length (measured  from  top  to  bottom  of  material)  with  the  appropriate  anodized  medal  secured  to the bottom.  16.6.8.1.  Upon award of subsequent decorations, additional issue will be accomplished.  Members must submit current MPF RIP to ensure accuracy.  When medals become worn or faded, they must be returned to honor guard Supply.  16.6.8.2.  All  full  sized  medals  will  be  worn  on  the  Ceremonial  blouse  as  prescribed  in AFI 36-2903.  Medals will not be aligned with more than three on a single row.  Multiple rows of medals will be overlapped as shown in Figure 16.2. of this manual.  The top row will overlap where the ribbon material tapers (angles) toward the medal.  The ceremonial blouse  will  not  be  visible  between  rows  of  medals.    To  prevent  the  coat  lapel  from covering  medals,  beginning  with  the  second  row  of  medals,  the  rows  may  contain  less than three with the top row centered over the row immediately below.  If necessary, the lapels  of  the  blouse  may  be  adjusted  to  ensure  that  all  medals  are  centered  and  can  be seen. NOTE:   Figure 11.1 in AFI 36-2903 is the authority on arranging medals.  388 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 16.2.  Full Size Medal Arrangement Diagram.  16.7.  Ceremonial Cap.   Ceremonial service caps will be clean, serviceable, string and wrinkle-free with the top taut and flat.  The chrome buckle of the functional chinstrap is worn on the right side of the hat when viewed from the rear.   16.7.1.  To position the functional chinstrap, unscrew the two chrome hat buttons holding the chinstrap into position.  Reverse the chinstrap so that the strap buckle is to the right of center when viewed from the rear.  Secure the functional chin strap into the up position.  16.7.2.  The  hook  will  be  positioned  down  with  the  chinstrap  parallel  to  the  ground  and supporting the chinstrap.  The hook will remain visible.  If the hook should become worn and is  no  longer  black  in  color,  individuals  will  color  the  hook  black  using  a  black  marker  or honor guard issued black high-gloss edge dressing. The patent leather bill and chinstrap will be spotless, free of cracks and other malformations at all times.  16.7.3.  The  pointed  tip  of  the  chinstrap  will  always  be  folded  under  the  keeper  to  create  a flat  edge.  NOTES:  1.  Since  patent  leather  and  poromeric  materials  are  easily  marred,  it should only be dusted or cleaned with  a clean, soft,  cotton  cloth and furniture polish, glass cleaner  or  poromeric  cleaner.  2.  The  cap  will  not  be  altered  beyond  manufacturer’s specifications  (i.e.,  do  not  replace  the  hatband  with  Marine  or  Army  type  hatbands).  However,  the  ceremonial  service  cap  will  be  adjusted  to  fit  the  individual’s  head  (no excessive shaping).  16.7.4.  The cap is worn squarely on the head so that the flat bottom part of the hat is parallel to the ground.  There will be no gaps on either side of the head and no hair protruding in the front.    There  must  be  enough  space  between  the  bill  of  the  cap  and  the  bridge  (top)  of  the AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 389 nose  to  place  the  wearer’s  index  and middle  fingers  together.    Shape  the  hat  to  conform  to head.  Do not excessively shape the bill of the cap.  A properly formed bill will have a curved appearance.  16.7.5.  The chinstrap is a functional item and will be worn in the down position only when inclement weather (strong winds) or mission (drill  team,  colors, and flight-line cordon etc.) dictates it.  At all other times the chinstrap will remain in the up position.  16.7.6.  When the chinstrap is worn in the down position, it will be adjusted to fit under the front of the chin firmly, but not tight enough to cause the head to protrude at the top of the hat.  The hook will be turned upright when the chinstrap is utilized.  16.7.7.  Honor guard officers will wear the chrome Coat of Arms service cap insignia on the ceremonial  cap.    Enlisted  personnel  will  wear  the  chrome  Wing  and  Star  insignia  (Hap Arnold device).  The screw in buttons on the sides of the cap will be worn with the wings of the design pointing to the sky, do not glue buttons in place.  The front chinstrap (silver) braid will be worn flush, grounded to the bill and free of strings.  The tips of the adjustable braid will be hot glued down. No silicone will be applied.  Figure 16.3.  Officers’ Ceremonial Cap Device.   390 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 Figure 16.4.  Proper Wear and Appearance of the Ceremonial Cap.   16.8.  Rain cap cover.   Whenever you wear the all-weather coat for a ceremony, you must wear the  rain  cap  cover  on  the  ceremonial  hat.    The  ceremonial  hat  emblem  is  not  displayed  on  the outside of rain cap cover.  It will remain under the rain cap cover.  Do not place a small hole in the rain cap cover.  16.8.1.  The  rain  cap  cover  will  always  be  worn  when  wearing  the  ceremonial  light  weight blue jacket during transit to and from a ceremony as well as during training.  Rain cap covers will be in  serviceable  condition  and placed on the ceremonial  cap in  a manner that permits coverage  of  the  entire  top  of  the  hat  and  the  entire  wing  and  star  or  officer’s  service  cap insignia devices.  The elastic band of the cover will rest against the seam where the top of the hat and the hat band meet.  This will be done when coming to, from and between ceremonies.  16.8.2.  The cover may  be rolled slightly to  ensure a taut/snug  and wrinkle-free appearance on the top.  Fabric protector spray will be applied to the rain cap cover.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 391 Figure 16.5.  Proper Wear and Appearance of the Rain Cap Cover.  16.9.  Ceremonial  Belt.    The  ceremonial  belt  and  back  belt  are  worn  when  it  is  practical  and pertinent to the ceremony.  Wear the ceremonial belt when the member does not do an extreme amount  of  moving  (e.g.  marching  in  parades).    Awards/flower/wreath  bearers,  OIC/NCOIC (OIC/NCOIC for MFH will not be bloused), color teams, flagbearers, door openers, escorts etc. wear  the  ceremonial  belt.    Belts  will  be  clean  and  in  serviceable  condition.    The  buckle  and keepers will be highly polished and chromed at all times.   16.9.1.  The belt will be worn between the second and third button of the ceremonial blouse (starting from the top).  On the all-weather coat, it will be worn between the second and third button (starting from the top), above the pockets. When worn on the overcoat, the belt will be located between the first and second button, above the pockets (starting from the top).  The belt will be worn tightly, with no sag, and always remain parallel to the ground.  16.9.2.  Enlisted  members  will  wear  the  “Wing  and  Star”  design  on  the  chrome  buckle; officers will wear the Coat of Arms design on the chrome buckle.  16.9.3.  On initial sizing of the belt, the belt ends should be trimmed to be no shorter than 4 inches and no longer than 6 inches on both sides, when measured from the buckle.  Cutting the  belt  too  short  will  cause  the  member  to  not  be  able  to  adjust  the  belt  to  accommodate weight gain and/or cold weather gear. NOTES:  1. The honor guard issued back belt will be worn  under  the  ceremonial  blouse  to  help  create  a  taut  appearance.  2.  Excessive  scratches and pits in the buckle will cause the belt to be deemed unserviceable.3. Certain blouses may be  manufactured  to  prevent  wearing  the  belt  between  the  second  and  third  buttons.    In  this case  it  is  acceptable  to  the  buckle  to  cover  the  second  button.    At  no  time  will  the  second button become exposed below the belt buckle.  Replace defective blouses when possible.  16.9.4.  When  worn  with  the  blouse,  all-weather  coat,  or  overcoat,  the  excess  uniform material  will  be  pulled  back  and  neatly  folded  and  tucked  behind  the  side  seams  of  the garment.  When this is accomplished, the back of the garment, from seam to seam, should be 392 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 smooth  and  flat.  This  process  is  known  as  blousing.    Blousing  is  a  two  person  task  (not counting  the  individual  who  is  being  “bloused”);  three  people  can  provide  an  even  tighter blouse.    Whenever  possible  use  three  people  to  blouse  the  Base  Honor  Guard  ceremonial blouse.  NOTE:    Members  will  ensure  that  the  ceremonial  belt  is  not  bloused  so  tight  as  to restrict blood circulation to the lower body.  Excessively tight blousing can result in personal injury.  16.9.4.1.  Blousing.  Adjust the belt to fit tightly around the waist.  As a rule of thumb no more than two fingers should be able fit between the individual and the belt.  16.9.4.2.  The “blousee” holds the belt in the approximate position where the belt fastens with some slack being provided for the “blousers” hands.  16.9.4.3.  The  “blouser”  positions  the  hands  along  two  side  seams  on  the  back  of  the blouse, raincoat, or overcoat.  16.9.4.4.  The “blouser” pulls the excess material from the front of the uniform and folds it underneath the two side seams in a forward position.  When bloused, the entire uniform appears neat, wrinkle-free, and without bunches.  16.9.4.5.  The “blousee” then fastens the belt in front.  16.9.4.6.  The  “blouser”  re-checks  the  ceremonial  belt  and  places  the  two  keepers  one inch  (approximately  a  thumbs  width)  from  the  chrome  belt  buckle  on  both  sides  of  the buckle.  Figure 16.6.  Blousing.  16.9.5.  Loose  ends  of  the  belt  will  be  taped  with  black  tape.    The  chrome  keepers  will  be situated  one  inch  from  either  side  of  the  buckle  and  will  be  slightly  pinched  in  the  rear  to minimize movement.  The two aluminum tension rods will each be replaced with three-inch sections of wire hangers to prevent the belt from loosening.  On initial sizing, the belt ends must be trimmed to no shorter than 4 inches and no longer than 6 inches on both sides of the buckle,  when  measured  from  the  edge  of  the  buckle.  NOTE:    The  wire  hangers  used  to  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 393 reinforce  the  belt  should  be  chrome  in  color  or  colored  black  if  chrome  hangers  cannot  be obtained.  Figure 16.7.  Enlisted and Officer Ceremonial Belts.   16.10.  Ceremonial  Gloves.    The white cloth gloves will be clean, free of stains, and worn on all  applicable  ceremonies  and  practices.    White  gloves  used  for  any  rifle  manuals  will  be siliconed,  in  good  repair  without  flaking,  and  will  present  a  neat,  clean  and  professional appearance.    All  personnel  will  keep  at  least  one  pair  of  clean,  non-siliconed  gloves  for  other types  of  ceremonies  (i.e.,  ushers,  escorts,  door  openers,  and  all  bearer  duties  etc.).    All  gloves will be worn in the same manner. The excess portion of each glove on the open end (up to the elastic  band)  will  be  folded  inside  the  glove  when  worn.    The  manufactures  tag  located  inside will be removed before the glove is  used. NOTE:    Siliconed white gloves should not  be worn during inclement (rain) weather as they may cause the rifle grip to become slippery.  16.10.1.  IAW 36-2903, white gloves are not authorized to be worn with any Air Force Blues combinations or the ABU. EXCEPTIONS:  White gloves may be worn with utility uniforms for all Dignified Transfers.  See paragraph 9.2.2.2. for more information.  White gloves are authorized for wear in the ABU only while training.  Remove immediately upon completion of training.  16.10.2.  Use of black gloves is permitted when performing ceremonies in cold weather.  All labels/tags will be removed from each black glove; if the manufacturer’s label/tag cannot be removed, then the visible portion of the tag will be concealed with a black permanent marker.  Honor  guard  issued  gloves  are  the  only  cold  weather  gloves  authorized  for  use  by  honor guard  personnel  during  official  ceremonies  (in  order  to  ensure  uniformity  in  formations).  Black gloves may be worn with the overcoat, all-weather coat, lightweight blue jacket, All-Purpose  Environmental  Clothing  System  (APECS)  and  ABU  as  part  of  the  prescribed uniform for cold weather. NOTES:  1. In the ceremonial uniform, black gloves will always be  worn  in  combination  with  the  black  scarf.  2.  Firing  party  personnel  may  elect  to  use 394 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 gloves that permit them to perform the firing sequence during funerals without interference.  Color  team  personnel  may  elect  to  use  gloves  that  permit  them  to  perform  guidon/flag manuals  without  interference.  Such  gloves  should  be  approved  by  leadership  and  uniform among  the  team.    Pallbearer  personnel  may  elect  to  wear  the  black  neoprene  gloves  to facilitate the flag fold.  Personnel performing saber/sword manuals may also elect to wear the black neoprene gloves to prevent saber/sword manual degradation  16.11.  Footwear/Ceremonial Shoes.    USAF Honor Guard personnel should maintain one pair of double-soled ceremonial shoes.  At a minimum,  all honor guard members will maintain one pair of ceremonial shoes with metal heel and toe preservers and cheaters.  16.11.1.  Ceremonial  shoes  will  be  clean,  shined  and  edge  dressed  at  all  times.    Refer  to paragraph 16.7.3. Note 1 for cleaning procedures.  16.11.2.  Single or double-soled ceremonial  shoes with  plastic or no heel  preservers will be worn for indoor ceremonies where slipping may become an issue and are not authorized for any outdoor ceremony.  16.11.3.  Nuts,  washers  and  other  forms  of  spacers  are  not  authorized  between  the  cheater and the shoe.  Cheaters will remain tightly secured to the soles.  16.11.4.  Base  Honor  Guards,  IAW  36-2903,  are  not  authorized  triple  soled  shoes.    Single and  double-soled  shoes  are  authorized.    The  soles  and  heels  are  not  to  exceed  9/16”  and  1 5/16” respectively.  16.11.5.  Laces will be tucked into the shoe.  NOTE:  If members were not issued shoes for use on indoor ceremonies, or ceremonies requiring no-steel, such as a National flagbearer at the White House then the member must tape the bottom of the shoe (completely covering the metal) using duct tape or a suitable substitute.  16.11.6.  Cracked or peeling shoes will not be worn.  New heel plates will be placed on the heels before the leather portion of the heel starts to wear.  Metal horseshoe style heel plates will  be  worn  on  the  heel  of  each  triple-soled  shoe  at  all  times.    Ceremonial  shoes  will  be cleaned  between  ceremonies  and  edge  dressing  will  be  reapplied  if  required.    Members performing duties of NPB on FHFs must have serviceable horseshoes on footwear.  16.11.7.  Ceremonial  double  or  triple-soled  shoes  will  be  worn  with  Air  Force  blues combination,  as  part  of  the  Joint  Service  rehearsal  uniform  (Paragraph  17.5.).    Military issued  single-soled  low  quarters  are  not  authorized  for  wear  with  the  USAF  Honor  Guard Ceremonial Uniform.  16.11.8.  During inclement weather, black boots are authorized for wear by all Honor Guard members.  USAF Honor Guard members will wear the Supply issued black, Corcoran Field Boot, item number 1525.  All members must wear matching boot styles.  Boots will be laced to  the  top  and  have  excess  laces  tucked  neatly  and  securely  inside  the  boot.    Do  not  wrap laces  around the top  of the boot.   Ceremonial  trousers will be  worn as with  the ceremonial shoes  and  not  be  bloused.    Boots  will  be  shined,  polished  and  edge  dressed  at  all  times.  High-gloss dyes, lusters, paints, artificial liquids and similar products will not be used in lieu of  shoe  polish  as  it  renders  the  boot  unserviceable  and  does  not  allow  for  the  repair  of defects.    Cheater  taps  will  be  worn  by  pallbearers  only  and  must  be  edge  dressed.    The AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 395 appearance of a ceremonial guardsman’s boots is a direct reflection of their commitment and dedication to the honor guard profession.  16.11.8.1.  The decision to wear boots will be based upon actual or forecasted conditions at Arlington National Cemetery.  During the winter months of 15 Oct through 15 April, the  requirement  for  pallbearers  to  wear  boots  will  be  made  by  the  pallbearer  NCOIC, with  approval  of  the  ceremony’s  OIC/NCOIC.    Also  during  the  winter  months,  the OIC/NCOIC  has  the  decision  authority  for  boot  wear  for  all  Flight  and  Firing  Party members.  During non-winter months, the decision to wear boots will be made with the lowest  approval  from  the  Operations  Flight  or  Stan  Team.    The  decision  to  wear  boots should be made as early as possible, but no later than the uniform call for the morning of the  ceremony.    The  call  to  wear  boots  must  be  made  early  enough  to  ensure  required members  are  in  boots  during  the  inspection  fallout  and  for  any  earlier  scheduled standards/palls  funerals.    If  boot  wear  is  approved,  they  are  to  be  worn  throughout  the remainder  of  the  day’s  ceremonies.    OIC/NCOIC  will  ensure  the  Arlington  Chaplain Corps  is  notified  when  the  decision  to  wear  boots  has  been  made.    Base  honor  guard personnel should develop their own guidance for authorizations to wear boots, but should limit these approvals to only in conditions of severe safety concerns.  Figure 16.8.

The  lightweight  blue  jacket  will  be  clean, serviceable  and  wrinkle/string-free.    Always  wear  the  lightweight  blue  jacket  during  transit  to and  from  a  ceremony  as  well  as  when  training  away  from  the  base.    Do  not  train  in  the ceremonial  blouse.    The  ceremonial  trousers  with  blue  shirt  are  not  an  authorized  uniform combination;  you  must  wear  the  lightweight  blue  jacket  over  the  blue  shirt.    The  standards outlined in paragraph 15.12. only apply to the honor guard issued ceremonial lightweight.   16.12.1.  The jacket will have a visible crease on the rear seam of the sleeve.  There will be no crease ironed into the front of the sleeve of the jacket.  The jacket will be worn when not performing ceremonies.  NOTE:  Only iron the crease on lightweight jackets containing the USAF  or  Base  Honor  Guard  arcs.    Do  not  iron  a  crease  in  the  standard  issued  Air  Force lightweight blue jacket.  16.12.2.  When  wearing  the  jacket,  ensure  that  the  elastic  waist  band  is  rolled  underneath. This creates a more professional appearance.  16.12.3.  The  zipper  will  be  zipped  up  to  at  least  the  bottom  of  the  tie  knot.    Females  will position the zipper to the first exposed button.  The zipper tab will be neatly tucked into the seam of the jacket.  16.12.4.  All assigned USAF Honor Guard personnel will wear the “USAF Honor Guard” arc 1/2-inch down from the left shoulder seam, centered, and parallel to the ground when worn.  Stitching  between  lettering  of  the  arc  will  be  colored  in  using  a  black  marker  or  removed using  a  seam  ripper.  It  is  mandatory  for  all  members  to  have  the  Air  Force  symbol embroidered over the left breast.  Base Honor Guard personnel are authorized to wear the arc on unit purchased/issued lightweights.  16.12.5.  (USAF Honor Guard Only)  .  The jacket will be worn without the liner.  During warm  weather  months,  a  condition  chart  will  be  used  to  govern  the  wear  of  the  jacket.  Conditions are as follows:  398 AFMAN34-515   11 AUGUST 2015 16.12.5.1.  CONDITION  GREEN. times.  EXCEPTION:    The  lightweight  jacket  is  not  required  when  transporting  equipment  or going from the Bldg. 46 parking lot to Bldg. 46.

The USAF Honor Guard Drill Team may wear the lightweight blue jacket as a modified ready uniform (but not during a performance) if wearing  the  ceremonial  blouse  is  impractical  (i.e.:  dining  situations,  etc.)  and  other utility  uniforms  would  be  inappropriate.    When  wearing  an  ascot  with  the  lightweight blue  jacket,  the  jacket  zipper  will  be  zipped  to  approximately  2/3  the  full  length  of  the zipper.  2. Lightweight blue jackets  will  be worn at  all times while on Fort Myer and in ANC.  Wear is optional in the Fort Myer Community Center and while in transit on the bus.    When  temperature  dictates,  the  OIC/NCOIC  may  authorize  removal  for  entire flight.  Figure 16.12.  Honor Guard Ceremonial Uniform with Ceremonial Lightweight Blue Jacket   16.13.  Ceremonial Overcoat.   The overcoat will be clean, serviceable, wrinkle/string-free and tailored  to  fit.  Honor  guard  issued  fabric  protector  spray  will  be  applied  prior  to  use.    The overcoat will have a visible crease on the rear seam of the sleeve.  Do not iron a crease into the front of the sleeve.  All personnel will wear the “USAF Honor Guard” or “Base Honor Guard” arc 1/2-inch down from the left shoulder seam, centered and parallel to the ground when worn.  Stitching between lettering of the arc will be colored in using a black marker or removed using a seam ripper.  16.13.1.  The  lapels  will  be  folded  and  ironed  flat  as  they  lay  naturally  when  the  coat  is buttoned.  Lapels will be pinned down by a safety pin from the inside of the coat.  The safety pin will not be visible.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 399 16.13.2.  All  ceremonial  guardsmen  will  have  six  1  1/8-inch  silver  buttons  affixed  on  the overcoat  displaying  the  “wing  and  star”  design  with  wingtips  up  (buttons  will  be  secured with pins in the same manner as the ceremonial blouse).  16.13.3.  Overcoats  will  have  a  3/4-inch  silver  braid  sewn  three  inches  from  bottom  of sleeve.    Cuff  (wrist)  straps  will  be  removed.    Belt  and  belt  loops  must  be  removed  for blousing purposes.  16.13.4.  Sewn on or metal rank insignia may be worn on the overcoat and will be worn IAW AFI 36-2903.  16.13.5.  All personnel will use safety pins to secure the open-end loop ceremonial aiguillette against, not under, the epaulet, grounded to the left shoulder seam.  The epaulet will remain flat.    The  aiguillette  will  be  secured  from  the  front  and  the  rear  of  the  left  seam.    The aiguillette will not appear bunched.  16.13.6.  A safety pin will be used to secure the split located on the bottom and rear side of the coat.  The safety pin is placed in a manner that it cannot be seen, half way up the split in the back of the coat.  16.13.7.  (USAF  Honor  Guard  Only)  .    Overcoats  will  be  carried  on  every  outdoor ceremony  from  15  October  through  15  April  (the  USAF  Honor  Guard  Commander  may authorize  changes  to  these  dates  as  necessary).    Refer  to  local  guidance  for  recommended temperature guidelines for wear.  16.13.8.  Base  Honor  Guards  should  develop  local  guidance  on  when  the  overcoat  will  be maintained and carried for outdoor ceremonies.  Figure 16.13.

All-weather coat will have two creases sewn in the back for blousing purposes and in  the sleeves. Belt loops will be removed.  NOTE:   When funding is  an  issue the standard issue all-weather coat is authorized for wear by BHG personnel.  Do not remove belt loops or modify the uniform, simply remove the issued belt and use the ceremonial belt in lieu of.  16.14.2.  All buttons will be buttoned, too include the top button (“flaps up”).  16.14.3.  A safety pin will be used to secure the split located on the bottom and rear side of the coat.  The safety pin is placed in a manner that it cannot be seen, half way up the split in the back of the coat.  16.14.4.  All-weather  coats  will  be  hand-carried  along  with  the  ceremonial  blouse  and equipment  during  all  outdoor  ceremonies.    This  includes  individuals  performing  outdoor functions during any indoor ceremony (i.e. door opener).  Figure 16.14.  Honor Guard Ceremonial Uniform with All-weather Coat   16.15.  Black Wool Scarves.   Scarves must be clean, serviceable, wrinkle/string-free and taped on the underside as to give a flat appearance when worn.  The scarf is authorized for wear with the ceremonial overcoat, all-weather coat and ceremonial lightweight blue jacket.  16.15.1.  All ceremonial guardsmen must tape the scarf, no exceptions.  16.15.2.  The scarf is worn with the end placed left over right (when seen from the wearer) crossing over the chest.  16.15.3.  The scarf is authorized for wear with the overcoat and all-weather coat.  16.15.4.  Safety pins will be attached to the ends of the scarf and one standard blousing strap will be used to secure the scarf in place around the wearer’s back.  Do not tape the scarf to the body.  AFMAN34-515  11 AUGUST 2015 401 16.15.5.  Wear  the  back  belt  on  top  of  the  scarf.

Flag Folding Script with Honor Guard Cues  (Narrator begins reading when the flag is draped over OIC/NCOIC’s arm)  For more than 200 years, the American flag has been the symbol of our nation’s unity, as well as a source of pride and inspiration for millions of citizens.  Born on June 14, 1777, the Second Continental Congress determined that the flag of the United States be thirteen stripes, alternating between seven red and six white; and that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field representing a new constellation.(See Note 1)  (Flag is at “table top” position)  Between 1777 and 1960, the shape and design of the flag evolved into the flag presented before you today.The 13 horizontal stripes represent the original 13 colonies, while the stars represent the 50 states of the Union.  The colors of the flag are symbolic as well; red symbolizes hardiness and valor; white signifies purity and innocence; and blue represents vigilance, perseverance and justice.(See Note 1)  Traditionally, a symbol of liberty, the American flag has carried the message of freedom, and inspired Americans, both at home and abroad.  (Begin the first triangular fold)  In 1814, Francis Scott Key was so moved at seeing the Stars and Stripes waving after the British shelling of Baltimore’s Fort McHenry that he wrote the words to The Star Spangled Banner.(See Note 3)  In 1892 the flag inspired Francis Bellamy to write the “Pledge of Allegiance,” our most famous flag salute and patriotic oath.(See Note 3)  (Flag lands in the union)  In July 1969 the American flag was “flown” in space when Neil Armstrong planted it on the surface of the moon.(See Note 3)  Today, our flag flies on constellations of Air Force satellites that circle our globe, and on the fin flash of our aircraft in harm’s way in every corner of the world. Indeed, it flies in the heart of every Airman who serves our great Nation.  The sun never sets on our U.S. Air Force, nor on the flag we so proudly cherish.(See Note 3)  (OIC/NCOIC is tucking the flag)  Since 1776 no generation of Americans has been spared the responsibility of defending freedom… Today’s Airmen remain committed to preserving the freedom that others won for us, for generations to come.  By displaying the flag and giving it a distinctive fold we show respect to the flag, and express our gratitude to those individuals who fought, and continue to fight for freedom, at home and abroad. (OIC/NCOIC has the flag in hand)  Since the dawn of the 20thcentury, Airmen have proudly flown the flag in every major conflict on lands and skies around the world.  It is their responsibility…our responsibility…to continue to protect and preserve the rights, privileges, and freedoms that we, as Americans, enjoy today.  The United States flag represents who we are.  It stands for the freedom we all share and the pride and patriotism we feel for our country.  We cherish its legacy, as a beacon of hope to one and all.  Long may it wave.  *The NCOIC should not say the message of retirement until the narrator completes the reading.
