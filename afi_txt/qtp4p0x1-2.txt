McDuffie TABLE OF CONTENTS   MODULE            OBJECTIVE                PAGES 1.                                Maintain crash carts or emergency administration sets         3 - 12          INTRODUCTION  1.  This Qualification Training Package (QTP) was developed to enhance and standardize on-the-job  training  for  4P0X1  personnel.    As  a  trainer,  the  QTPs  provide  teachable  elements  of  task breakdowns.      The  teachable  elements  will  assist  in  guiding  the  trainee  towards  independent task  performance,  proficiency,  and  serve  as  an  evaluation  tool  for  task  certifiers/certification officials.  2.    Review  each  volume(s)  of  the  Career  Development  Course  (CDC)  and  identify  which module(s) of QTPs are needed for the trainee’s job position or upgrade skill-level training.   The QTP training for each module should be accomplished in the order which most closely mirrors the area the trainee is working in.   Items in column 2 of the Pharmacy Career Field Education and  Training  Plan  (CFETP)  marked  with  a  5  or  7  are  the  core  tasks  for  the  4P  career  field.  Additional proficiency training may be required for these tasks at the supervisor’s discretion.   3.  Ensure the trainee reviews the training references in each module prior to attempting any task or QTP evaluation.  Review the performance checklist and training objective with the trainee.  If the trainee has questions about the objective, clarify the desired outcome/results of performance, demonstration or completion for the task.  Remember the objective of each QTP is to standardize training and allow sufficient time for the trainee to learn each task thoroughly in order to perform the task independently.    4.  When the trainee has received sufficient training and is ready to be evaluated on the objective, follow  the  evaluation  instructions.      The  performance  checklist  must  be  used  as  you  evaluate each task objective.  When the trainee successfully demonstrates and accomplishes the objective, document task completion appropriately in the member’s 6-part training/competency folder.  5.  The QTP task completion is to be annotated on an AF Form 1098 Special Task Certification and  Recurring  Training,  filed  in  part  3,  section  A  of  the  6-part  training/competency  folder.  NOTE:  The individual check lists and final evaluations are not filed in each member’s 6-part training/competency  folder.    A  master  checklist  is  filed  in  part  3,  section  A  of  the  Master Training Plan (MTP) folder.  6.    If  the  trainee  does  not  accomplish  the  objective,  review  the  areas  needing  remediation.  Conduct feedback for each module with the trainee, and document appropriately in the member’s 6-part training/competency folder.  As the trainer, once you are satisfied the trainee is ready to perform the task, he/she will be re-evaluated until the objective is met.  7.  If a task being trained requires third party certification by a task certifier/certifying official, the trainer ensures trainee is qualified to perform the task independently.  The trainee will then be  evaluated  by  certifier/certifying  official.    Tasks  requiring  third  party  certification  are identified in column 2 of CFETP with a number sign (#).  The third party certifier will ensure documentation  in  column  3E  of  the  CFETP)  and  finally  documented  appropriately  in  the members’ 6-part training/competency folder.  8.  The QTPs are a necessary tool for standardizing task qualifications for upgrade training or job position  training.    Such  standardization  benefits  the  CFETP  training  concept  throughout  a member’s  career.    These  documents  also  may  be  used  in  assessing/certifying  pharmacy technicians upon arrival at a new duty station.  9.  Feedback is a vital and important part of improving our educational process for pharmacy technicians.    You  first  hand  expertise  is  valued  and  feedback  highly  encouraged  ensuring  we have the most up-to-date information and training possible.   Please direct all inquiries to:  your immediate supervisor.                                        SUBJECT AREA:  Inpatient Pharmacy or Support Pharmacy  TASK NAME(S):  Maintain Crash Carts  CFETP/STS REFERENCE(S):  6.3.8; 6.3.8.1  EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: 1.  Crash Cart Tray 2.  Neonatal/Universal Code Blue Control Log 3.  Security Bag 4.  Medications  TRAINING REFERENCE(S):  JCAHO Standard MM 2.30                                                       AFI 44-102, Medical Care Management                                                       AFI 44-108, Infection Control   REMARKS/NOTES:  None  OBJECTIVE:    1.  Build and track code tray.   2.  Inspect code cart.  EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:    1.    After the trainee has received instructions, allow sufficient practice on each part of the task.  2.    Use the performance checklist to ensure all steps of the task are accomplished without assistance and without error.  3.    Document task competency upon completion of the evaluation in the trainee’s 6-part training/competency folder.  Initial evaluation should be documented in the CFETP.    STEPS IN TASK PERFORMANCE:  1.  Building a Code Tray   1.1. Choose a new Pediatric/Universal code blue control log (see attachments).   1.2. Start with a tray that has been returned to the pharmacy.   1.3. Refer to new control log and check expiration dates and quantities; replenish as necessary and sign when finished.    1.4. Tray is then verified against what is written on new control log for accuracy by checker and signed once it is correctly filled.   1.5. Seal up entire tray with a security bag with the perforated tear on the top.   1.6. Once tray has been sealed with security bag put in storage area for dispensing.  2. Tracking a Code Tray   2.1. Check code tray book prior to performing inspection to verify which tray, lock number and expiration date the department should have on the ward/clinic.  Annotate the tray number, lock number, and expiration date on monthly inspection checklist (see attachment).   2.2. If the tray is expired or will expire before the next scheduled inspection replace the tray.  If the tray is replaced annotate the form with the new tray and lock numbers along with expiration date.  Be sure upon returning to pharmacy that you update the new information on that particular ward/clinic’s code tray master tracking sheet.  3. Inspecting a Code Cart   3.1. Ensure code tray on ward/clinic coincide with item 2.1.  If not write down on inspection checklist (item 1) the number tray, expiration date, and/or lock number found.  Be sure upon returning to pharmacy that you update the correct information of tray, expiration date, and lock number found on specific ward/clinic code tray master tracking sheet (see attachment).   3.2. Open each drawer of the code cart, checking for expired pharmaceuticals, i.e. Cetacaine spray, Lidocaine jelly 2%, and IV fluids.  Check any dated items for expiration and if it belongs in drawer at all.   3.3. Expired pharmaceuticals are taken back to the pharmacy and replaced with unexpired stock before inspection is completed. Make a note of expired items, go to pharmacy and retrieve them and then remove expired items from cart.  Do not take medications/trays back to pharmacy without a replacement being added (in case there is a code while you are updating cart). IV fluids are replaced and all outdated items are returned to pharmacy for destruction.  Annotate on inspection checklist number 8 that the “Standard was Not Met”.  Under the remarks section itemize the pharmaceuticals that were expired, expiration date, and their quantities.  Annotate that the items were replaced if applicable.  ATTACHMENT(S):  1.
