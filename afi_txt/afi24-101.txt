The  ITO  or  the  TMC  makes  official  travel  arrangements and  provides  reservations  and  ticketing  for  all  uniformed  service  members,  DoD  civilian employees,  their  family  members  and  non-DoD  personnel  when  travel  orders  authorize  travel and transportation. 2.1.1.  The  primary  consideration  when  arranging  official  travel  is  to  satisfy  mission requirements as determined by the Authorizing/Order-Issuing Official (AO) following DoD and Air Force transportation and travel policies. 2.1.2.  Each traveler, including all infants, must be issued a ticket and provided a seat on all conveyances.  (T-0). 2.1.3.  Official Travel. IAW JTR Appendix A., official travel may be performed within or in the vicinity of a permanent duty station (PDS); to or from the actual residence; to, from, or between PDS; and to, from, at, and between temporary duty (TDY) locations. 2.2.  DoD  Approved  Carriers.  DoDI  4500.53,  DoD  Commercial  Air  Transportation  Quality and Safety Review Program, requires the DoD to procure commercial air transportation services from  air  carriers  approved  by  the  DoD  Commercial  Airlift  Review  Board  (CARB),  HQ AMC/A3B, unit 3A1, 402 Scott Drive, Scott AFB IL, 62269-5302, DSN 779-1751, Commercial (618) 229-1751. 2.2.1.  The CARB is authorized by law to make decisions regarding the temporary non-use or permanent suspension of an air carrier in the DoD Air Transportation Program. DTMO and HQ AMC/A3B maintains a listing of DoD approved and suspended air carriers, and provides updates to the Services. 2.2.2.  The  listing  is  updated/released  quarterly  via  message  to  AF/A4LR  and  QAE’s  and must be reviewed before making commercial air travel arrangements. A current listing may be obtained by contacting DTMO, Program Management Office or AF/A4LR. 2.3.  Order of Precedence for Travel  . 2.3.1.  DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 103 establishes that the ITO/TMC must use a specific order of precedence when making official travel arrangements. Accordingly, the DoD policy, in the following priorities, in order of precedence, must be used for passenger airlift: (T-0). 2.3.2.  United  States  Transportation  Command  (USTRANSCOM)  -contracted  airlift  (e.g., Patriot  Express  (PE)  channel  airlift)  for  OCONUS  travel  unless  there  is  a  documented negative  critical  mission  impact.  (T-0).  Refer  to  DTR  Part  1,  Appendix  O  for  routing instructions and additional guidance. 2.3.2.1.  Even if the service can be provided at less cost by a commercial air carrier. 2.3.2.2.  Even  if  commercial  air  service  is  preferred  by  or  is  more  convenient  for  the traveler. 20 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 2.3.2.3.  OCONUS  travel  requests  generated  by  the  Defense  Travel  System  must  be routed to  ensure USTRANSCOM seats are fully utilized. to  commercial  carrier  consideration through the  TO  prior 2.3.2.4.  To support non-use of  AMC-PE due to  a documented negative critical  mission impact,  a mission impact statement must be provided by the traveler and certified/signed by  their  unit  commander  or  designee  (only  in  the  commander’s  absence),  detailing  the impact of remaining booked on the AMC flight. Use either the format in Attachment 2, a locally  generated written request  for the mission impact  statement.   In addition  the ITO also uses the mandatory non-availability statement/message generated by the Global Air Transportation  and  Execution  System  (GATES)  for  the  requested  travel  window  as validation that AMC is not available.  Prior to scheduling commercial accommodations, and in order to receive the mandatory GATES non-availability statement/message, ITOs must place all unsupported GATES travel requests on hold and wait for AMC to provide the non-availability statement/message (T-1). 2.3.3.  Scheduled  commercial  air  service  contracted Administration (GSA) Airline City Pair Program (CPP) contract. through the  General  Services 2.3.4.  Other U.S. CRAF carriers. 2.3.5.  DoD-approved, non-CRAF U.S. Flag carriers. 2.3.6.  Scheduled service on U.S. air carrier that are neither DoD-approved nor-disapproved (for individual travel only). 2.3.7.  DoD-approved foreign flag carriers. 2.3.8.  Non-DoD-approved carriers (for individual travel). 2.4.  U.  S.  Flag  Carriers  .  Travelers  must  use  U.S.  flag  carriers  for  travel  funded  by  the  U.S. government. (T-0). The use of foreign flag carriers is prohibited when U.S. carriers are available. 2.4.1.  The exception to this requirement is if a U.S. flag carrier has a Code Share Agreement with  a  foreign  partner  airline.  A  Code  Share  Agreement,  sometimes  simply  called  Code Share, is an aviation business arrangement where two or more airlines share the same flight. A seat can be purchased on one airline but is actually operated by a cooperating airline under a  different  flight  number  or  code.  Any  tickets  issued  under  a  code  share  agreement  must show  the  U.S.  flag  carrier  as  the  ticket  issuing  authority,  and  is  not  considered  a  foreign carrier  (B-  240956;  Sep  25,  1991;  70  Comptroller  General  713,  1991).  (T-0).  When  using code  share  flights  involving  U.S.-certificated  air  carriers  and  non-U.S.-certificated  air carriers, the U.S.-certificated air carrier flight number must be used on the ticket. (T-0). If the non-U.S.-certificated  air  carrier  flight  number  is  used  on  the  ticket,  the  ticket  is  on  a  non-U.S.-certificated air carrier and a non-availability of U.S.-certificated air carrier document is needed. See JTR, par. 3525. 2.4.2.  When the ITO/TMC determines U.S. flag carriers are not available, including a code share partner, documentation must be provided to the traveler and Authorizing/Order Issuing Official  (AO)  advising  that  only  foreign  carriers  are  available  for  the  requested  travel segment(s).  (T-0).  The  AO  may  approve  the  use  of  foreign  flag  when  the  ITO/TMC determines US Flag carriers are not available.  Reference JTR para. 3525. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 21 2.4.3.  If  it  is  determined  that  U.S.  flag  carriers  are  not  available,  ITO/TMC  must  provide documentation  explaining  why  a  U.S.  flag  carrier  cannot  be  used  must  be  provided  to  the traveler  and  endorsed  by  the  AO.  (T-0).  The  documentation  must  include  the  name  of  the traveler,  foreign-flag  ship(s)  or  air  carrier(s)  used,  flight  identification  number(s),  origin, destination  and  enroute  points,  date(s),  justification,  and  authorizing/approving  official’s title, organization and signature. (T-1). 2.4.4.  The  Order  Issuing  Official/AO  must  annotate  the  travel  order  reflecting  U.S.  flag carrier  is  not  available  to  satisfy  mission  requirements  and  that  a  foreign  flag  carrier  was authorized/approved for use. (T-1). 2.4.5.  When U.S. flag carriers are available, travelers with prior authorization to personally- procure  airline  tickets  (e.g.,  LICWO  or  circuitous  routing),  must  be  advised  by  the AO/ITO/TMC  not  to  use  foreign  flag  carriers  over  segments  of  their  travel  for  which reimbursement for travel must be claimed. (T-1). Reimbursement is not provided (for any leg of  the  journey)  for  transportation  costs  when  unauthorized/unapproved  foreign  carriers  are used. If U.S. flag carrier service is available for an entire trip and the traveler uses a foreign carrier  for  any  part  or  all  of  the  trip,  the  transportation  cost  on  the  foreign  carrier  is  not payable (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 41, Chapter 301, Part 301-10). 2.5.  Use of General Services Administration (GSA) Airline City Pair Program (CPP). 2.5.1.  Uniformed  service  members  and  DoD  employees  on  official  travel  are  mandatory users  of  the  GSA  Airline  CPP.  There  are  two  types  of  GSA  City  Pair  fares,  non-restricted City  Pair  fares  (YCA)  and  capacity  controlled  City  Pair  fares  (_CA),  which  are  less expensive than YCA fares, but have some limitation or restrictions. The _CA fares should be used  if  the  restrictions  do  not  hinder  mission  accomplishment.  The  ITO  must  use  this program when a City Pair exists between the origin and destination listed in the official travel order. (T-2). 2.5.2.  Government  contractors  and  contractor  employees  are  governed  by  the  rules  in  the Federal  Acquisition  Regulations  (FAR)  31.205-46,  and  are  not  government  employees  and are  therefore  not  eligible,  under  any  circumstances,  to  use  GSA  City  Pair  airfares,  or  any travel-related item restricted to government employees. 2.5.3.  Government airfares (e.g., GSA City Pair fares - YCA and _CA, air fares offered by non-contract carriers at City Pair rates - _DG, international non-contract air fare - MMZ, etc.) may  be  used  for  official  DoD  travel  only,  but  only  after  City  Pair  fares  are  deemed  to  be unavailable. City Pair fares may not be segmented when a through-fare exists, even if it costs less.  Constructed  YCA  and  _CA  fares  may  be  used  when  there  is  no  through-fare  between the  origin  and  destination  listed  on  the  official  travel  orders.  Unlike  YCA  and  _CA  fares, when using other government fares such as YMZ, MMZ, MDG, HDG, the use of through or segmented  fares  may  be  used  to  meet  mission  requirements  when  they  provide  the  overall best  value.  Some  airlines  may  have  restrictions,  check  with  appropriate  airline  carrier  for specifics. 2.5.4.  Exceptions to the use of GSA City Pairs Program can be found in the DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, Ch.103. 22 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 2.5.5.  This  program  is  mandatory  for  group  travel  up  to  9  passengers.  For  additional information on guidance on obtaining group travel arrangements for 10 or more passengers, see paragraph 3.5. 2.5.6.  IAW  JTR  Appendix  O.  An  AO  may  direct  a  member  to  perform  TDY  (when  TDY was  unknown  prior  to  leave)  from  the  leave  location.    In  these  cases,  a  City  Pair  fair  is authorized from the leave location to the TDY location. 2.6.  The  TMC  .  The  TMC  is  a  civilian  operated  business  under  contract  with  the  DoD  that provides transportation and travel services for uniformed service members, DoD employees and authorized  dependents  as  outlined  in  the  scope  of  the  contract  (Performance  Work  Statement) and DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Chapter 102. Use of the TMC for official travel is mandatory when it is  available (physically,  telephonically,  and electronically).  The TMC shall not  issue tickets  to the  traveler  without  a  valid  travel  order/authorization  or  written  approval  from  TO/AO.  (T-1).  Travelers  must  arrange  commercial  transportation,  rental  cars  (if  authorized),  and  government and commercial lodging through the TMC.  (T-0). The TMC arranges international  government airlift  under  Air  Mobility  Command  (AMC)  contract/control  when  it  is  available  and  when  it satisfies  mission  requirements  (if  identified  in  the  TMC  Performance  Work  Statement  (PWS)). The TMC captures, record and report Statistical Collection of Passenger Travel (STATCO) Data in  accordance  with  DTR  4500.9-R,  Part  I,  Appendix  H.  The  TMC  makes  Government  and commercial lodging reservations with the automated interfaces (when available) and documents “non-availability”  for  Government  lodging  on  trip  records  when  appropriate.  The  TMC calculates  a  “should-cost  estimate”  based  on  traveler  and  TMC  inputs  and  forward  the information  to  the  AO  for  review.  Ticketing  must  not  occur  until  the  TMC  receives  approval from  the  AO  and  no  earlier  than  three  government  business  days  for  CONUS,  and  five government business days for OCONUS prior to travel. (T-0). 2.6.1.  The TMC provides the ITO with the data required to complete the Unused Ticket Data and Refund Data report. 2.6.2.  Unused  ticket  reports  are  due  to  AFIMSC/IZSL  via  SharePoint®  or  a  designated automation  system,  no  later  than  the  5th  calendar  day  after  TMC  report  is  made  available.  (T-2). AFIMSC/IZSL’s consolidated report is due to AF/A4LR no later than the 21st of the following month after the end of each quarter. 2.7.  Use of  Premium Class Travel  (PCT)  Accommodations.  DoD policy requires the use of least  expensive  coach  class  transportation  accommodations  for  all  official  travel.  (T-0).  PCT upgrades are permitted without approval when there is no cost to the Government (e.g., through the  use  of  cash  or  frequent  traveler  benefits).  PCT  Categories.  There  are  two  types  of  PCT accommodations:  first  class  and  premium  class  other  than  first  class  (hereafter  referred  to  as business class). 2.7.1.  The  ITO  must  educate  the  populace  that  advance  planning  is  required  to  ensure travelers  comply  with  DoD’s  and  Air  Force  PCT  policy.  (T-0).  PCT  accommodations  are authorized  on  an  exemption  basis  only  in  order  to  meet  mission  requirements.  Blanket authorization/approval of PCT and self-approval of PCT is not permitted. 2.7.2.  Economy  Plus/Coach  Elite  Seating.    Economy  plus/coach  elite  seating  service  may vary  from  airline  to  airline,  but  it  is  considered  economy/coach  cabin  and  is  not  other  than economy/coach travel, and only requires the authorizing/order-issuing official approval. This AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 23 seating is typically designated by the airline within the economy/coach passenger cabin. The seats  typically have additional  legroom.  The AO must determine that the additional cost  of economy  plus  type  seating  is  in  the  Government’s  interest,  and/or  necessary  because  the traveler and/or dependent is limited by a special need (see JTR App A1) such that lesser cost economy/coach accommodations are not adequate. (T-0). (Reference: JTR 3515). 2.7.3.  First and Business class travel accommodations may be authorized/approved when at least  one  of  the  criteria  identified  in  the  JTR,  paragraph  3520-C  is  met,  fully  justified  and documented. Requests for PCT accommodations will be considered on a case-by-case basis. PCT  accommodations  shall  not  be  used  for  PCS travel  nor  for  CONUS  to  CONUS  flights, except for those limited conditions outlined in the JTR. When PCT is authorized/approved it applies  to  the  principal  traveler  only,  unless  specifically  approved  for  other  travelers  in  the party. PCT upgrades are permitted without approval  when there is  no additional cost  to the Government (e.g., through the use of cash or frequent traveler benefits). 2.7.4.  PCT  accommodations  may  be  authorized/approved  on  an  exception  basis  only  as outlined  in  the  JTR,  paragraph  3520,  for  military  personnel,  DoD  civilian  employees, military  and  civilian  dependents,  and  personnel  traveling  under  Invitational  Travel Authorizations (ITAs). 2.7.5.  Self-approval of PCT for first or business class is prohibited. 2.7.6.  Code  two  and  three  Presidential  appointees  and  three-  and  four-star  general  officers must obtain business class travel approval from a person senior to the traveler in their chain of command. (T-0). 2.7.7.  To the maximum extent possible, the ITO will ensure the TMC is compliant with their contractual obligations and do not issue first or business class travel accommodations without proper advance approval unless it results in a cheaper cost between the authorized origin and destination (including connection points). (T-0). PCT arrangements resulting in a higher cost must  be  authorized/approved  by travel authorizing/approving authority.  (T-0). PCT requests will be staffed to AFIMSC/IZSL for a policy review. (T-2). First Class travel will be staffed by AFIMSC/IZSL to AF/A4LR. (T-2). Business Class travel is sent back to the requester for staffing and approval. first  or  business  class the  appropriate 2.7.8.  First class travel accommodations. The SECAF has designated SAF/OS and SAF/US as the approval authorities for all first class travel accommodation requests, except as noted below. 2.7.8.1.  First class travel requests for civilian personnel will be submitted to SAF/AA for review and routing to SAF/OS or SAF/US as appropriate for consideration. 2.7.8.2.  First class travel requests for military personnel will be routed to AF/A4LR for review and staffing to AF/CV. (T-1). 2.7.8.3.  The AF/CV will review all military PCT requests and determine whether or not they should be forwarded to SAF/AA for approval consideration. 2.7.8.4.  SAF/AA  will  review  and  route  to  SAF/OS  or  SAF/US  as  appropriate  for consideration of approval/disapproval. 24 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 2.7.9.  Business  class  travel  accommodations.  The  SECAF  has  designated  the  following  as business  class  travel  authorizing/approval  and  reporting  officials.  Note:    The  approval authority exception at paragraph 2.7.11this instruction. 2.7.10.  Air  Staff  and  Air  Force  Secretariat  civilian  personnel  forward  all  business  class travel accommodation requests to SAF/AA. 2.7.10.1.  Air  Staff  and  Air  Force  Secretariat  military  personnel  will  route  all  business class travel accommodation requests to AF/A4LR, for review and forwarding to AF/CV. 2.7.10.2.  The AF/CV will review and determine whether or not military requests should be forwarded to SAF/AA for consideration of approval/disapproval. 2.7.10.3.  SAF/AA  is  the  business  class  approval  authority  for  three-star  generals  and below and civilian equivalents assigned to the Air Staff and the Air Force Secretariat. 2.7.10.4.  SAF/AA  will  review  and  forward  business  class  travel  requests  for  four-star general  and  civilian  equivalents  assigned  within  the  Air  Staff  and  the  Air  Force Secretariat consideration  of approval/disapproval. to  SAF/OS  or  SAF/US as appropriate for 2.7.10.5.  The  MAJCOM  Commander  (MAJCOM/CV  in  the  absence  of  the  CC)  is  the authorizing/approval  authority  for  business  class  travel  for  requests  from  personnel assigned to the MAJCOM. Note:  Includes personnel assigned to a Numbered Air Force when  traveling  on  Air  Force  business.  When  traveling  on  Joint  business,  requests  for business  class  approval  are  submitted  in  accordance  with  the  Joint  Staff  approval procedures. 2.7.10.6.  The  AF/A3  is  the  authorizing/approval  authority  for  business  class  travel  for requests from personnel assigned to DRUs and FOAs. 2.7.10.7.  In  accordance  with  the  JTR,  paragraphs  3520  (First  Class)  and    (Business Class) the category "When required by mission" can only be applied in connection with Federal advisory committees, special high-level invited guests, and U.S. defense attachés accompanying  ministers  of  foreign  governments  traveling  to  the  U.S.  to  consult  with members  of  the  Federal  government  (approval  level  is  Director,  Administration  and Management, Office of the SECDEF, or as delegated by the Director) and for the Armed Forces Entertainment (AFE) Program, (approval level is the Executive Agent for the AFE program, currently the Department of the Air Force). 2.8.  PCT  Approval  Process.  Every  effort  must  be  made  to  obtain  authorization  prior  to traveling.  However,  in  cases  where  extenuating  or  emergency  circumstances  make  advanced authorization  impossible,  the  traveler  must  still  obtain  "after-  the-fact"  written  approval  at  the earliest possible time. In the event an after-the-fact request is disapproved, the traveler is liable for the difference in cost between the premium class and coach class air accommodations. (T-0). Note:   JTR, 3505.B, Business/First Class Airfare Costs Less than Least Expensive Unrestricted Economy-/Coach-class  Airfare.  When  a  business-/first-class  airfare  costs  less  than  the  least expensive  unrestricted  economy/coach  class  airfare,  no  authorization/approval  is  required. Comparison of the business/first class airfare to an economy/coach class airfare more expensive than the least expensive unrestricted economy/coach class airfare is not authorized). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 25 2.8.1.  To  assist  the  authorizing/approval  official  in  determining  whether  the  PCT  request meets the JTR criteria, please refer to JTR Appendix H. 2.8.2.  The traveler submits the PCT request through their authorizing/order- issuing official (AO) to the appropriate designated PCT authorizing/approval authority. . Requests for PCT accommodation that must  be approved at  the AF/CV, SAF/AA, SAF/US or SAF/OS levels should be submitted as soon as the requirement is anticipated, but not less than 15 duty days prior  to  the  desired  travel  date.  Note:  MAJCOMs,  DRUs,  and  FOAs  should  establish  PCT internal routing procedures for their organizations. 2.8.3.  The  designated  PCT  authorizing/approval  authority  reviews  the  request  to  ensure sufficient  justification  is  provided  to  show  mission  necessity  and  justify  the  expenditure  of additional Government funds. After the decision is made to approve or disapprove the PCT request,  the  PCT  authorizing/approval  authority  forwards  the  decision  to  the  travel authorizing/approving  official  (AO).  If  the  PCT  request  is  approved,  the  PCT  approval authority  must  retain  a  file  copy  of  the  approved  package  for  a  period  of  6  years  and  3 months for audit purposes. 2.8.4.  When  the  travel  AO  receives  the  PCT  authorizing/approval  authority’s  decision,  the AO  notifies  the  traveler  of  the  decision.  If  authorized/approved,  the  AO  ensures  the appropriate information from the documentation (see below example for appropriate words) is entered on the travel order/authorization so the TMC can issue PCT tickets. 2.9.  PCT  Documentation  Requirements.  Before  the  TMC  issue  PCT  tickets,  the  AO  must enter a statement in the remarks section of the travel order/authorization indicating that PCT has been  approved.  (T-1).  The  minimum  information  that  must  be  entered  on  the  travel order/authorization is: 2.9.1.  The type of PCT accommodations approved. (First Class or Business Class). (T-1). 2.9.2.  The regulatory reference in the JTR that was used to justify the PCT. (T-1). 2.9.3.  The  cost  difference  between  the  premium  class  and  coach  class  fares  (normal Government routing, YCA and other Government contract fares, etc.). (T-1). 2.9.4.  The premium class approving authority, Name, Rank, and Office Symbol. (T-1). tickets  by the  TMC 2.9.5.  For  extenuating  circumstances  or  emergency  situations  that  prevent  advance authorization  of  premium  class  travel,  a  statement  will  be  placed  on  that  travel order/authorization to permit TMC ticketing (reference JTR para 2000). The statement must indicate  the  extenuating  circumstance  or  emergency  precluding  PCT  authorization  prior  to the start of travel and that approval is being or will be pursued after-the-fact. (T-0). Issuance of  PCT the authorizing/approval authority does not approve the after-the-fact PCT request, the traveler is responsible  for  the  cost  difference  between  the  PCT  transportation  used  and  the transportation class for which the traveler was eligible. The statement must include the cost difference  between  the  coach  class  and  the  premium  class  being  requested  and  the  name, rank and office symbol of the AO. (T-0). The JTR requires that after-the-fact PCT approval be  sought  within  five  business  days  of  travel  completion.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the traveler  and  AO  to  ensure  that  the  PCT  approval  is  obtained  or  that  the  traveler  pays  the in  anticipation  of  approval.  If is  permitted 26 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 difference  between  the  travel  class  authorized  and  the  travel  class  used.  An  example  of required statement: Example: After-the fact approval for business class travel is being pursued. This is a short notice travel requirement and sufficient time is not available to obtain authorization prior to travel commencement. Business class travel is being justified in accordance with JTR, paragraph 3520; space is not available in coach class. The cost difference between the business class fare and the coach class fare is $765.00. If the request for business class travel is not approved, the traveler is responsible for the cost difference between the business class fare and the coach class fare. The TMC is authorized to provide business class tickets for this travel. 2.10.  Premium  Class  Travel  Reporting  Requirement.  When  requested  by  DTMO  and/or reflected  on  their  OTECC  report,  all  identified  PCT  must  be  validated  and  supporting documentation entered into the Premium Class Reporting Tool. (T-0).  2.10.1.  ‘Exceptional  circumstances’  may  be  -  travel  on  an  extremely  demanding  schedule, the requirement to work enroute to the TDY location, and the need to be prepared to perform official  duties  and  properly  represent  the  Air  Force  or  U.S.  Government  immediately  upon arrival. 2.10.2.  Per  the  JTR,  the  length  of  the  flight(s)  alone  is  not  sufficient  basis  for  approval  of PCT. Use of the '14-hour rule', as it relates to rest stops, requires that scheduled flight time (including stopovers) is in excess of 14 hours, and that the traveler be required to perform a full  day  (8  hours)  of  work  immediately  upon  arrival  at  the  TDY  location.  Business  class travel cannot be approved under this rule when rest stops are approved. 2.10.3.  Business Class requests originating at base level must be submitted to the TO by the traveler through his/her unit commander to the Wing/Center Commander following the chain of  command.  (T-1).    After  endorsement,  the  Commander  submits  the  requests  to  their MAJCOM  for  approval/disapproval. to AFIMSC/IZSL for technical/policy review.  AFIMSC/IZSL will conduct a policy review and forward  the  request  to  traveler’s  MAJCOM  for  approval/disapproval.  (T-1).  MAJCOM provides a response to the requester and AFIMSC/IZSL All requests must be kept on file for two  years. those authorized/approved) shall be sent to AF/A4LR. (T-1).   The  MAJCOM  will  submit the  request   An informational  copy  of  all (T-1). requests (including 2.10.4.  Business Class requests originating at the MAJCOM HQ staff must be submitted to AFIMSC/IZSL for technical/policy review. 2.10.5.

All  necessary  documentation  (tickets,  travel  notification,  travel  orders, medical certificate, etc.). (T-1). 2.11.  Official  [Non-reimbursable]  Spouse  Travel  . As a  general  rule, a family member may not  travel  at  government  expense  with  a  DOD  sponsor  who  is  traveling  on  official  business (TDY).  However,  travel  on  military  airlift  is  permitted  under  certain  circumstances.  Typically, family member travel involves spouses traveling with their DOD sponsor on government aircraft 28 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 under circumstances where there is  no additional  cost  to  the Air Force.  Spouse travel  is  highly visible and sensitive; therefore, it requires judicious application with a thorough review at each level  of  command.  Precedent  setting  requests  require  a  high  level  of  scrutiny,  and  legal  office coordination is mandatory. 2.11.1.  The  following  are  Spouse  Travel  approving  authorities  when  the  travel  meets established criteria in this instruction and JTR: 2.11.1.1.  SECAF and CSAF for their own spouse’s/family member’s travel; 2.11.1.2.  SECAF for spouse travel of members of the Secretariat; 2.11.1.3.  AF/CV delegates to AF/CVA for spouse travel of personnel assigned to the Air Staff; 2.11.1.4.  AF/CV  and  four  star  MAJCOM/CCs  for  travel  of  their  own  spouse  (see exception in the Note in paragraph 2.11.1.10); 2.11.1.5.  AF/CV  delegates  to  AF/A3  for  three  star  or  lower  MAJCOM/CC’s  spouse travel; 2.11.1.6.  Selected three-star general officers (i.e., 5 AF/CC, 7 AF/CC, 11 AF/CC), when acting in the role of combined commanders, for their own spouse’s travel when the travel meets  the  criteria  of  this  instruction.  When  acting  in  their  Air  Force  role,  these commanders  must  submit  their  spouse  travel  requests  IAW  this  instruction  (also  see DODI 4515.13, Enclosure 2); 2.11.1.7.  MAJCOM/CCs and CVs for all travel by spouses of personnel assigned to their command when the travel meets the criteria of this instruction.  Note:  In the absence of the MAJCOM/CC, a Vice Commander cannot approve a spouse travel request for his or her own spouse/family member, but must elevate to the next higher official in the chain, AF/CV unless otherwise delegated/designated. 2.11.1.8.  AF/CV  delegates  to  AF/CVA  for  all  spouse  travel  of  personnel  assigned  to  a DRU  (i.e.,  AF  Academy)  or  FOA.  AF/CV  retains  approval  authority  for  all  other  AF personnel  not  covered  by  an  approval  authority  identified  in  this  instruction.  Spouse travel requests not under the cognizant authority of a commander specified above must be forwarded  through  command/Air  Staff  channels  to  AF/CV  or  AF/CVA  as  appropriate (provide  information  copy  to  AF/A4LR  for  staffing)  for    authorization/approval. Requests should be submitted as soon as the requirement is anticipated, but not less than 20 duty days prior to the travel date. (T-1). When submitting requests to the AF/CV, the MAJCOM  commander  (CV  in  CC’s  absence)  must  endorse  all  requests.  (T-1).  Full justification is required for all requests and must meet the criteria of this instruction. 2.11.1.9.  AF/CV  serves  as  the  sole  Air  Force  approval  authority  for  any  instance  in which the requested spouse travel is not to accompany the DoD sponsor (should be a very rare exception). 2.11.1.10.  In  AF/CVA’s  absence,  requests  will  be  forwarded  to  AF/CV’s  office  for action  covered  by  the  delegations  in  paragraphs  (2.11.1.3,  2.11.1.5,  2.11.1.8).  The authorities delegated to AF/CVA and AF/A3 are not further re-delegable. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 29 2.11.1.11.  Travel  approval  authorities  must  examine  the  circumstances  underlying  each request  for  spouse  travel,  and  must  make  a  determination  (regarding  each  of  the following) whether: 2.11.1.12.  The facts support one of the basis listed in paragraph 2.11.1.15; 2.11.1.13.  The  facts  support  the  determination  by  the  DoD  sponsor  that  the  spouse’s presence would further the interest of DoD, the Air Force or the particular command; and 2.11.1.14.  From  the  perspective  of  fiscal  responsibility  (considering  costs  to  the Government [operation and fuel costs, crew costs, etc.] and aircraft utilization), a suitably justifiable basis exists to support the proposed use of Air Force resources (also taking into account the comments in DoDD 4500.56, Enclosure 3, paragraph 5(c). 2.11.1.15.  In accordance with DoDD 4500.56, official (non-reimbursable) spouse travel on government aircraft may be permitted when the facts of a particular situation support the spouse traveling to: 2.11.1.15.1.  Attend a function in which the DoD sponsor will participate in his or her official capacity and in which the spouse is to address those assembled or otherwise play an active role and visible part; 2.11.1.15.2.  Attend  a  function  (with  or  without  the  DoD  Sponsor)  attended  by spouses  of  community  leaders,  government  officials,  foreign  dignitaries  or  foreign military  officers  with  whom  the  DoD  sponsor  is  meeting  in  his  or  her  official capacity.  This  basis  does  not  require  the  spouse  to  have  an  independent  role  at  the function; or 2.11.1.15.3.  Attend a function (with or without the DoD Sponsor) where a substantial portion  of  those  present  are  military  families,  or  where  the  focus  is  on  matters  of particular concern to military families. This basis does not require the spouse to have an independent role at the function 2.12.  Spouse Travel Documentation. 2.12.1.  Requests for approval of spouse travel at Government expense must in each instance include  an  advance  documented  determination  by  the  DoD  sponsor  of  the  proposed  spouse traveler that, in his or her judgment, the spouse’s presence would further the interest of DoD, the Air Force or the particular command. Where possible the request should cite the specific portion  of  paragraph  2.11.1.15  upon  which  the  request  is  based.  IAW  DODD  4500.56, Enclosure 3, paragraph 4, such a determination is required for each stop of a multi-leg spouse travel itinerary and must be available for review by the travel approval authority. 2.12.2.  Requests  for  official  spouse  travel  must  be  accompanied  by  a  suitable  agenda  or other  descriptive  document  which  fully  outlines  the  spouse’s  role  and  the  facts  supporting approval of the request, including the identity of other attendees. 2.12.3.  The  supporting  documentation  and  signature  of  the  DoD  sponsor  on  the  MILAIR request  documentation  (DD  Form  2768,  Military  Air  Passenger/Cargo  Request)  which includes  details  of  the  requested  spouse  travel,  constitutes  the  attestation/determination required  by  DoD  policy  (DoDD  4500.56,  Enclosure  3,  paragraphs  5(a)  and  5(e))  and  this instruction. 30 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 2.12.4.  This record will be maintained as part of the recordkeeping requirement established by of DoDD 4500.56, Enclosure 3, paragraph 5(e). 2.12.5.  Per  Diem  and  Other  Expenses.  Official  spouse  travelers  will  not  be  authorized  per diem and other travel expenses except in those limited instances when CSAF provides prior approval.  Per  Diem  and  other  expense  allowances  may  be  authorized  by  CSAF  if  the individual's  travel  is  mission  essential  and  there  is  a  benefit  to  DoD  beyond  fulfilling  a representational role (See JTR, Appendix E, Part 1.A.2.m(3)). 2.12.6.  Include the following statement in the ITA as specified in JTR, Appendix E, Part 1, “This  travel  authorization  authorizes  the  spouse  to  accompany  the  sponsor  to  attend  an official function.  It does not authorize per diem or other expense allowances for the spouse.  If the spouse/dependent  does not  desire to  bear the expenses ordinarily  reimbursed through per diem or other expense allowances, this travel authorization is canceled.” 2.12.7.  Considerations when evaluating requests for official spouse travel. 2.12.7.1.  Non-reimbursed  spouse  travel  will  normally  be  by  government  airlift  when reasonably  available  on  a  noninterference  basis  if  air  travel  is  consistent  with  current authorities  and  policies.  Travel  approval  authorities  may  approve  use  of  a  commercial carrier  for  part  or  all  of  proposed  spouse  travel  as  justified  by  the  facts  of  a  particular request.  In  this  regard,  it  should  be  noted  that  the  revisions  to  DoDD  4500.56  indicate they  are  not  intended  as  “new  or  additional  authority  to  expend  appropriated  funds  on commercial air travel.” 2.12.7.2.  A request for a spouse’s attendance at conferences, events, visits or tours is not on its own merit sufficient justification for spouse travel at Government expense. 2.12.7.3.  A  request  for  travel  to  allow  a  spouse’s  attendance  at  a  social  event  attended only by DoD or Air Force officials is not sufficient justification for travel at Government expense. 2.12.7.4.  The following  is  a non-exclusive list  of examples of events  which, depending on the particular case, may support official spouse travel: 2.12.7.5.  Travel during which the spouse will actually participate in an official function, during which the spouse will actually confer with DoD officials on official DoD matters in  a  manner  directly  benefiting  the  Air  Force  through  an  exchange  of  substantive information, advice and/or guidance. 2.12.7.6.  Travel  requests  that  include  trips  to  functions  with  government  officials  of foreign countries, including travel of spouses to act as escorts for spouses during CSAF counterpart visits or attaché tours or visits. 2.12.7.7.  Travel  involving  meetings  with  officials  of  the  foreign  ministry,  defense ministry and foreign air force in which one of the criteria in paragraph 2.11.1.15 is clearly established. 2.12.7.8.  Travel  involving  public  relations  events  may  establish  one  of  the  criteria  in paragraph  2.11.1.15    to  include  (depending  on  the  facts)  visiting  with  local  officials where  Air  Force  personnel  are  stationed  or  travel  within  the  U.S.  when  the  spouse accompanies the Air Force official to public relations functions which include spouses of local officials and/or civic leaders. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 31 2.12.7.9.  Travel involving  participation  with  officials  outside  of  U.S.  military departments, including local officials or civic leaders, in visits to DoD schools, hospitals, day-care  facilities,  family  service  centers,  family  housing  areas,  housing  management offices, commissary or exchange facilities. 2.12.7.10.  Travel  that  involves  representing  the  military  family  at  key  civic  events  that are attended by officials outside the U.S. military departments and DoD. 2.12.7.11.  Travel for a MAJCOM or Numbered Air Force (NAF) Commander’s spouse may  be  approved  for  visits  to  MAJCOM  or  NAF  bases.  Spouse  travel  visits  should  be limited  to  host  wing/bases  subordinate  to  the  MAJCOM  or  NAF,  and  where  possible, planners and travelers are to involve more than one base per trip.  Note: Official spouse travel  is  not  automatically  authorized  for  Wing  Commander/Command  Chief  visits  to units subordinate to a wing. 2.12.7.12.  Travel  for  MAJCOM  Commander/Command  Chief  Master  Sergeant  Annual Conferences in accordance with current Air Force conference and budget policy. Official spouse travel for such events should be limited to one trip per fiscal year. 2.12.7.13.  Travel for leadership courses. Official spouse travel for such events should be limited to one trip per fiscal year. 2.12.7.14.  Separate  HQ  USAF  approval  of  spouse  travel  is  not  required  for  spouses  of individuals  selected  to  attend  Wing  or  Group  Commanders’  or  Command  Chief  Master Sergeants’  Courses  hosted  by  or  on  behalf  of  HQ  USAF,  so  as  to  allow  spouses  to participate  in  the  Spouses’  Seminar  hosted  in  conjunction  with  those  courses.  This authorization is contingent on CSAF prior approval of the courses for that academic year. Unless  otherwise  approved  in  advance  in  accordance  with  this  instruction,  spouses attending these events are not authorized reimbursement for lodging or per diem. 2.12.7.15.  Spouse attendance at leadership orientation courses hosted at the MAJCOM or NAF  level  requires  approval  by  the  respective  travel  approval  authority.  Travel  may  be authorized  for  MAJCOM  sponsored  Squadron  Commander  or  Command  Chief  Master Sergeant  Orientation  Conferences  when  the  DoD  sponsor  attending  is  a  current commander or command chief master sergeant with at least 12 months tenure remaining. This  also  applies  to  a  commander  or  command  chief  master  sergeant  designee  selected through quota control procedures without regard to current assignment. Only one trip to the leadership orientation course should be authorized during the sponsor’s tenure in the particular leadership position. 2.12.7.16.  Travel  to  participate  in  DoD  or  service  component  training  courses, conferences, or seminars supporting family readiness as a subject-matter expert (e.g., the spouse is qualified to speak to/train attendees by virtue of his/her education in a particular subject.) 2.12.8.  Misc. Ceremonies, Other Events. 2.12.8.1.  Change of Command Ceremonies.  As a general rule, a spouse may not attend a change of command ceremony at which he/she has no official role, when such attendance will  occur  during  a  travel  stop  that  does  not  otherwise  justify  official  spouse  travel.  Depending on the facts,  a travel approval authority may determine that, IAW paragraph 32 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 the  circumstances  and  anticipated  attendees 2.11.1.15.2, justify  official  (non-reimbursable) spouse travel.   Official spouse travel  for  change of  command ceremonies using  this  authority  is  only  available  to  CSAF  (or  his  designated  representative)  and MAJCOM/CCs (or their designated representatives). 2.12.8.2.  Retirement,  Promotion  Ceremonies.  Travel  by  Air  Force  personnel  to  these types of ceremonies is restricted by various Air Force policies. As a general rule, official travel  should  not  be  authorized  solely  to  attend  a  retirement  or  promotion  ceremony. Similarly, a spouse may not attend a retirement or promotion ceremony at which he/she has  no  official  role,  when  such  attendance  will  occur  during  a  travel  stop  that  does  not otherwise justify official spouse travel. In those cases where the DoD Sponsor spouse has legitimate reason to attend the event in a TDY status, and, depending on the facts, a travel approval authority may determine that, IAW paragraph 2.11.1.15, the circumstances and anticipated attendees justify official spouse travel. Official spouse travel for retirement or promotion ceremonies using this authority is  only  available to  CSAF (or his  designated representative) and MAJCOM/CCs (or their designated representatives). 2.12.8.3.  Funerals,  Dignified  Transfers.  As  a  general  rule,  a  spouse  may  not  attend  a funeral  or  dignified  transfer  ceremony  during  which  she/he  has  no  official  role,  when such  attendance  will  occur  during  a  travel  stop  that  does  not  otherwise  justify  official spouse travel. IAW paragraph 2.11.1.15 of this instruction, and depending on the facts, a travel approval authority may determine that the circumstances and anticipated attendees justify  official  spouse  travel.  Official  spouse  travel  using  this  authority  in  this circumstance  must  be  applied  in  conjunction  with  the  authorities  found  in  AFI  34-242, Mortuary Affairs Program, paragraph 9.6.2 (unit representative travel). Spouse travel to funerals or dignified transfers using this authority is only available to one representative from  each  organizational  level,  e.g.,  SECAF  or  CSAF  (or  her/his  designated representative)  from  the  HAF,  a  MAJCOM/CC  (or  his/her  designated  representative) from  the  MAJCOM,  and  so  on  for  the  NAF,  group,  wing  and  squadron  level,  as appropriate. 2.13.  Unofficial  Family  Member/Spouse  Travel  .  When  no  official  basis  can  be  established for  official  (non-reimbursable)  travel,  in  certain  circumstances,  spouses  may  travel  at  personal expense in  the company of a senior DoD personnel  who is  traveling on  official  business.  Such unofficial  travel  is  authorized  on  military  aircraft  only  on  a  noninterference  basis:  the  aircraft must  already  be  scheduled  for  an  official  purpose;  official  travelers  must  not  be  displaced;  the travel results in negligible additional cost to the Government or the Government is reimbursed at the full commercial coach class fare rate (IAW Office of Management and Budget, Circular No. A-126, full coach fare is defined as a coach fare available to the general public between the day that  the  travel  was  planned  and  the  day  the  travel  occurred.)  Advantage  can  be  taken  of  early purchase discounts and internet purchasing alternatives, as long as the fare matches the times and dates of actual travel and is available to the general public. The DoD sponsor will attach to his or her  travel  voucher  a  personal  check  made  payable  to  the  Treasurer  of  the  United  States  and include documentation that reflects the full coach class fare (See DoDI 4515.13). 2.14.  Invitational Travel Authorization (ITA  ). In all instances of spouse travel (official [non-reimbursable]  or  unofficial),  after  the  authorizing  authority  approves  spouse  travel,  the requesting organization will issue an ITA in accordance with AFI 65-103 and the JTR, Appendix E,  funding  transportation  only.  (T-0).  A  specific  approval  request  must  be  generated  for  each AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 33 instance of spouse travel. (T-0). Blanket ITAs will not be issued.  Supporting documentation to include a separate itinerary agenda is mandatory and will be retained for two years. (T-1). 2.14.1.  When  the  spouse  is  an  Air  Force  uniformed  service  member  or  Air  Force  Civil Service employee and spouse travel is approved, a TDY order will be issued rather than an ITA. (T-0). 2.14.2.  Include the following statement in the ITA as specified in JTR, Part 1, Appendix E., “This order authorizes the dependent to accompany the sponsor to attend an official function. It  does not  entitle the dependent  to  per diem or  other expense allowances.  If the dependent does not desire to bear the expenses, this order is canceled.” 2.14.3.  All  spouse  travel  (official  [non-reimbursable]  or  unofficial)  shall  be  approved  in advance  of  the  proposed  travel.  “After-the-fact”  approvals  of  spouse  travel  are  not authorized. (T-0). 2.15.  Family Member/Spouse Travel to Award Ceremonies. 2.15.1.  This family member/spouse travel to award ceremonies is not the same as the spouse travel  outlined  in  paragraph  2.11,  which  requires  official  participation.  MAJCOM commanders  and  vice  commanders  may  approve  spouse  travel  for  spouses  of  Air  Force  or higher  level  award  recipients  assigned  to  their  command.  Several  examples  of  applicable major  awards  that  fit  this  spouse  approval  criteria  include:  Presidential  awards,  annual agency/  major  organizational  component  ceremonies  (does  not  include  MAJCOM  level awards), prestigious honorary award ceremony sponsored by a non-Federal organization and those  listed  in  AFI  36-2805,  Special  Trophies  and  Awards.  When  family  member/spouse travel to attend an award ceremony is approved, an ITA will  be issued. Only transportation costs will be funded; per diem will not be paid. 2.15.2.  If  there  is  no  spouse  or  the  spouse  is  unable  to  attend,  the  recipient  may  elect  to invite one family member to attend the ceremony. When family member travel to attend an award ceremony is approved, an ITA will be issued. Only transportation costs will be funded; per diem will not be paid.  See JTR, Appendix E, Part I for further guidance. 2.15.3.  When the family member/spouse is  an Air Force uniformed service member  or Air Force  Civil  Service  employee  and  family  member/spouse  travel  is  approved,  a  TDY  order will be issued rather than an ITA. (T-0). 2.15.4.  When  an  individual  who  is  neither  an  Air  Force  member  nor  an  Air  Force  Civil Service employee is selected as an award recipient, the recipient and family member/spouse may  travel  on  an  ITA  to  attend  the  presentation  ceremony.  See  JTR,  Appendix  E,  for guidance and limitations on travel reimbursements. Note: Refer to the JTR, Appendix E for instructions and limitations on travel  reimbursements  for members and  employees and  ITA for  family  members  and  non-  Department  of  the  Air  Force  civilians,  family  members  and spouses  traveling  to  an  award  ceremony  are  not  required  to  meet  the  participation requirements stipulated in  , Paragraph 2.11 2.16.  Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC)  .  The Department of Defense (DoD) policy is that the Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC) will be used by all DoD personnel (military or civilian) to pay for all costs related to official government travel. (T-0). 34 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 2.16.1.  Individual  Billed  Account  (IBA).    All  DoD  personnel  (military  and  civilian),  to include infrequent travelers that do not meet the exemption criteria under section 040602, of the  DTMO’s  Government  Travel  Charge  Card  Regulations:  Authorized  by  DoDI  5154.31, Volume 4 are mandatory users of the IBA. 2.16.2.  Centrally  Billed  Account  (CBA).    CBA  usage  must  be  limited  to  DoD  personnel (military  and  civilian)  that  meet  the  exempt  criteria  in  section  040602,  of  the  DTMO’s Government  Travel  Charge  Card  Regulations:  Authorized  by  DoDI  5154.31,  Volume  4,  or established by AFIMSC/IZSL.    CBA usage must be minimized to avoid costly handling and administrative fees, and prompt payment act penalties.  (T-1).  The TO, in conjunction with the TMC and FSO must establish procedures for use of the CBA on the installation.  (T-2). 2.17.  Frequent  Flyer  Program  Benefits  .  Government  travelers  on  official  business  at government expense that are members of a frequent flyer program  may  retain for personal use any  points  or  miles,  upgrades,  or  access  to  carrier  clubs  or  facilities    accrued  through  official travel. The promotional material must be obtained under the same terms as those offered to the general public and must be at no cost to the government. (T-0). When using frequent flyer miles to upgrade to business or first class, Air Force members may not wear military uniforms. (T-1). Even when an upgrade is legitimate, wearing of the uniform may create the public perception of the  misuse  of  government  travel  resources;  therefore,  wear  of  the  uniform  should  be  avoided under these circumstances. (T-1). Additionally, Air Force personnel should not allow a rank or grade to be associated with an upgrade. Please note that membership in frequent flyer programs is not justification to override the requirement (in future reservations) to utilize assigned contract carriers  through  the  GSA  City  Pairs  Program.    Similarly,  vouchers  given  when  travelers  are involuntarily removed or bumped from an airlines seats belong to the government and must be turned in (T-0). Vouchers received for voluntarily giving up seats belong to the traveler and may be kept so long as there is no additional cost to the government for the delayed travel.  Travelers are not allowed to claim additional benefits when volunteering to give up seats. 2.18.  Standards  for  Traveling  in  Uniform:  IAW  AFI  1-1,  Air  Force  Standards,  when departing from or arriving at commercial airports in the continental United States, any authorized combination of uniform, except the flight duty uniform, may be worn. When departing from and arriving  at  a  military  airfield  via  United  States  government  aircraft  or  contracted  United  States government commercial flights, any authorized combination of the uniform is appropriate. When traveling  in  an  official  capacity  on  commercial  air  overseas,  members  should  consult  the  DoD Foreign Clearance Guide official web site for information pertaining to authorized and expected uniform  wear.  Members  who  wear  civilian  clothes  during  official  travel  must  ensure  their clothing is neat, clean, and appropriate for the mode of travel and destination. (T-1). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 35 Chapter 3 TRAVEL PROCEDURES 3.1.  Arranging  Travel.  The  members’  travel  order/authorization  establish  the  official  travel points.      Official  travel  arrangements  must  follow  normal  point-to-point  routing.  (T-0).  The priority  order  of  precedence  in  DTR  4500.9-R,  Part  1,  Chapter  103  must  be  followed  to  the maximum  extent  possible.  (T-0).  The  TMC  must  route  passengers  using  Patriot  Express  (if identified in the TMC PWS) and City Pair fares, when available.  (T-0).    It is mandatory policy that all employees/members use an available DTMO contracted TMC, or a GSA contracted TMC (when  a  DTMO  contracted  TMC  is  not  available)  for  all  official  transportation  requirements, except when authorized IAW JTR Paragraph. 3045. (T-0).  3.2.  Travelers.  DoD official travelers with access to DTS are required to schedule commercial transportation using DTS. (T-0). 3.3.  Circuitous/Indirect  Travel.  JTR  3005.E.  Circuitous/indirect is  any  route (CONUS/OCONUS)  other  than  the  one  normally  prescribed  by  the  ITO  between  the  official places listed in members TDY or PCS orders. travel 3.3.1.  Members  requesting  circuitous  travel  are  required  to  pay  excess  costs,  if  any, compared to the cost the government would have paid over the ITO prescribed travel route. 3.3.2.  When traveling to, from and between OCONUS locations, circuitous routing must be approved  in  advance  of  travel  by  the  servicing  MPS/AO,  and  annotated  in  the  members travel orders to assist in reimbursement of the official travel cost.  (T-0). Upon request, the ITO will provide the government constructed cost to the traveler and/or the MPS/AO to assist in  decision  making.  (T-2).  See  AFIMSC/IZSL  SharePoint®  to  access  the  PCS/TDY Deviation Travel Form. 3.3.3.  Authorized  travelers  may  self-procure  through  the  TMC  all  commercial  tickets, including  the  transoceanic  portion  in  accordance  with  the  approved  (indicated  in  orders) circuitous routing. Reimbursement must be limited to the cost of normal direct point-to-point routing for official travel. (T-0).   Reference paragraph 2.4 for foreign-flag carrier rules. 3.3.4.  Military members and their command-sponsored dependents may obtain approval for circuitous  routing  in  connection  with  PCS  travel  (e.g.  leave)  (including  separations  and retirements). Command-sponsored dependents may accompany the member on the approved circuitous route or travel independently. Members stationed overseas must submit circuitous travel  request  -NLT  120  days  before  their  Date  of  Eligibility  for  Return  from  Overseas (DEROS). (T-0).  Circuitous routing must not be used to relocate dependents overseas when the sponsor is assigned to a restricted, remote or isolated area. Note: This does not apply to designated-location moves. 3.3.5.  When  traveling  to  from  and  between  CONUS  locations,  the  member  and  their dependent(s) may elect circuitous routing.  Prior approval for circuitous travel is not required on  CONUS  PCS  travel;  however,  the  traveler  is  limited  to  the  cost  of  the  normal  routing between the official places listed on the member travel orders and prescribed by the ITO. 36 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 3.3.6.  Space-available travel may be used in conjunction with space-required travel as long as  space-available  travel  does  not  substitute  for  any  single  leg  for  which  the  traveler  has  a space-required entitlement. Reference DoDI 4515.13, section 4, paragraph 4.5. 3.3.7.  When circuitous travel is desired, members must ensure approval is annotated in PCS order (including ERD, IPCOT and deferred COT) prior to traveling. (T-0). 3.3.8.  When  advance  circuitous  travel  routing  is  approved  by  the  MPS/AO  travelers  may procure from the TMC or other sources. 3.3.9.  If  the  member  is  authorized  circuitous  travel  and  chooses  to  travel  by  other  modes (e.g., ship, rail, etc.), the member will receive reimbursement up to the authorized cost of the normal route as stated in the PCS travel order (including ERD, COT, and deferred COT). 3.3.10.  The  ITO  must  instruct  members  and/or  their  dependents  they  are  responsible  for complying  with  all  border  clearance  requirements  outlined  in  the  DoD  4500.54-G  for countries visited. (T-0). 3.3.11.  The ITO must instruct member and/or their dependents they must maintain copies of all  travel  documents  to  support  voucher  requests  for  reimbursement  up  to  the  government constructive cost. (T-0). 3.3.12.  Transoceanic  travel  must  be  by  U.S.  flag  carrier  or  by  foreign  flag  carrier  under  a U.S.  code-share  agreement,  when  available.  (T-O).  For  more  information  on  foreign-flag carriers see paragraph 2.4. 3.3.13.  Reimbursement for travel on a foreign flag carrier is authorized if U.S. flag carriers are not available on the direct/normal route and not available on the circuitous route between the old  and new permanent  duty stations. (JTR, Paragraph. 3525-H).   Note: The  ITO/TMC must provide non-U.S. flag carrier availability statement prior to dates of travel. (T-0). 3.4.  Dual  Commitment  Transportation  .  DTR  4500.9-  R,  Part  1  chapter  102,  paragraph  B. Dual  commitment  transportation  involves  making  official  travel  arrangements  using  more  than one  source  simultaneously  (commercial  and  MILAIR).    This  practice  may  result  in  duplicate accommodations  and  therefore  should  be  avoided  at  all  times  to  prevent  waste  of  government resources. 3.5.  Group Passenger Movements.  The Air Force defines group travel as 10 or more members traveling  together  with  same  dates  and  times  to  the  same  destination.    Travel  of  10  or  more members  falls  under  the  AMC  Military  Air  Transportation  Agreement  (MATA)  and  is  a  non-mandatory user of the GSA Airline City Pair Program. Booking individual reservations in order to by-pass group booking procedures is in violation of airline tariffs and is not acceptable under any circumstances. The TO has the authority to route any size group except those requiring the purchase of a full planeload charter. 3.5.1.  Once the provisions of para 2.3 are met (Order of Precedence) the following applies: 3.5.2.  A  movement  of  less  than  10  members  traveling  as  a  group,  falls  under  the  GSA Airline  City  Pair  Program  contract  and  is  a  mandatory  user  of  the  GSA  Airline  City  Pair Program. 3.5.3.  Under  the  GSA  Airline  City  Pair  Program  agreement  and  the  (MATA,  airlines  may impose  group  travel  cancellation  penalties  for  late  passenger  cancellations  and  no-shows. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 37 Reference the GSA Airline City Pair contract (paragraph. B.2) and/or the MATA (paragraph. E.1) for cancellation fee information on groups (see DTR, Part 1, Ch. 102, paragraph F, for more information and procedures on how to request group movements). 3.5.4.  The  primary  mode  of  travel  for  training  accessions  traveling  to  Technical  Training Schools (initial skills training) in groups of 10 or more within a 650-mile radius is chartered bus. 3.6.  Leave-In-Conjunction  with  Official  (LICWO)  travel,  though  similar  to  circuitous routing,  refers  only  to  unofficial  travel  in  conjunction  with  TDY.  See  chapter  4  of  this instruction. 3.7.  International  Travel  .  The  official  travel  orders  establish  the  official  travel  points.  To arrange  routes  and  reservations,  the  ITO/TMC  routes  the  traveler  IAW  DTR  4500.9R,  Part  I, Appendix  O,  GSA  Airline  City  Pair  Program,  DoD  Foreign  Clearance  Guide  and  other appropriate industry publications and service directives. 3.7.1.  The ITO/TMC must obtain reservations from the AMC Passenger Operations Center by  GATES  or  via  telephone  for  international  travel  when  available.  (T-0).  If  military  or AMC contracted air transportation is not available, the ITO/TMC must route travelers using the GSA Airline City Pair Program fares (when available) or the policy constructed fare over the normally traveled route between the  closest  international  airport serving the old  or new PDS,  the  official  TDY  location,  or  the  designated  privately  owned  vehicle  (POV)  port  or vehicle processing center (VPC). (T-0). 3.7.2.  Members (TDY or PCS) desiring to deviate from the official route between the losing and gaining duty stations must be informed that this constitutes circuitous travel and must be processed IAW paragraph 3.3. (T-3). 3.7.3.  All  unapproved  deviations/circuitous  travel  (e.g.  personal  travel  detours  from  the usual  traveled  route)  is  the  traveler’s  financial  responsibility.  Government  fares  are  not allowed  over  circuitous  routes  (approved  or  unapproved)  and  the  traveler  is  personally responsible  for  all  costs  exceeding  the  government’s  constructive  costs  of  travel  on  the official route. 3.7.4.  For  booking  AMC/PE  flights,  a  minimum  10-day  travel  window  is  required  for  all PCS travelers; a 20-day window is requested for members traveling with pets. (T-0).   3.7.5.  Guidelines in  the  following paragraphs  establish the recommended primary ports  for PCS, TDY and other transoceanic travel such as: circuitous travel, early return of dependents, student travel, etc. These guidelines do not apply to emergency leave. 3.7.5.1.  When  traveling  to  and  from  OCONUS  locations,  ITO/TMC  must  route  the member from  the AMC  channel  mission closest  to old  and new PDS.  (T-0).  If AMC  is not available, ITO/TMC must use GSA City Pairs (when available) from the international airports closest to the old and new PDS, over the normally scheduled route. (T-0). If CPP airfares are not  available over the normally scheduled route, use the Policy Constructed Airfares. (T-0). 3.7.5.2.  Members  authorized  to  ship  or  store  a  POV,  may  be  routed  from/to  the international  airport  closest  to  the  VPC,  and  the  member’s  new  PDS.  Note:  When  a 38 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 member elects to self-procure storage of their POV for personal convenience, travel is not authorized to the storage facility. Reference JTR Para 5384-A. 3.7.6.  Travelers  may  request  a  rest  stop  on  international  flights  at  the  CONUS/OCONUS port of entry in connection with official travel. Rest stops may be requested for international travel when offered by the airline carrier, at no additional cost to the government, and travel is conducted over the normally traveled route. A rest stop must not exceed 24 hours.  (T-0). Travelers  must  not  be  routed  circuitously  to  take  advantage  of  a  rest  stop.  (T-1).  See  JTR, Paragraph 4415. 3.7.7.  Retirement and Separation When Home of Selection is  Authorized.   (Ref: JTR 5068, AFI 36-2102  2.26- 2.33 and AFI-36-3203 para 2.2- 2.5).  To ensure traveler receive the  correct  information  regarding  their  travel  and  transportation  allowances,  ITOs  should review  the  above    references,  and  advise  travelers  to  contact  their  local  MPS  and  Finance offices  prior  to  making  their  final  travel  decisions.    The  travel  allowances  included  in  the Orders determine the travel options provided to the travelers. 3.8.  Excess Cost Collection for Official Travel.  To establish a uniform entitlement for official travel  cost  comparisons,  use  the  priority  order  of  precedence  for  passenger  airlift  provided  in paragraph  2.3.  The  primary  method  for  determining  official  travel  costs  are  AMC  fares,  GSA Airline City Pair program fares or other government fares when available. Comparison to fares must be based on the air service available at the time of request (e.g., how much the travel cost would have been if the ITO/TMC had booked the travel). When a CBA is used and a member’s travel request exceeds the authorized government cost, ITO/TMC must initiate a DD Form 1131, Cash  Collection  Voucher  or  DD  Form  139,  Pay  Adjustment  Authorization.  (T-2).  Government constructive costs should be included on the Passenger Name Record (PNR) and filed with travel voucher as appropriate. 3.9.  Alaska  Marine  Highway  System.  The  Alaska  Marine  Highway  System  (AMHS)  is  an oceangoing car ferry service for transporting passengers, baggage, vehicles, and pets between the states  of  Washington  and  Alaska.  Reservations  may  be  arranged  by  the  local  ITO/TMC,  or  by contacting  AMHS.  The  primary  method  of  payment  is  the  Government  Travel  Charge  Card (GTCC). AMHS reported that due to a steady increase in the number of DoD Travelers making reservations and failing to show, ferry bookings are now subject to being charged at the time of reservation  rather  than  at  check-in.    ITO/TMCs  must  advise  travelers  of  their  requirement  to show up for the reservations or cancel as early as possible to avoid being charged as a no show fee. (T-2).  Reimbursement is limited to the costs to move the member, authorized dependents, and a POV (pet shipments not included). Fees for use of the AMHS to transport one POV to a new PDS are reimbursable under JTR, paragraph. 3710. Reimbursement of fees do not preclude the use of the POV shipping entitlement authorized in the JTR, paragraph. 3705. 3.10.  Invitational  Travel  Authorization  (ITAs).  Invitational travel is official travel primarily involving non-governmental personnel, including spouses and other family members as stated in JTR Appendix E. If approved, the ITO/TMC must arrange official travel for individuals traveling on  ITAs.  (T-1).  IAW  JTR  Appendix  I,  part  1,  Delegation  of  Authority,  when  delegated  by  the responsible  major  air  command  the  following  authorities  may  issue  ITAs:  Commander, MAJCOM; Commander, Intermediate Echelon; and Commander of a Wing, Group or Squadron. Requests for travel approval should be submitted at least 20 working days prior to the anticipated date of travel. All requests must be forwarded through appropriate channels in the same manner AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 39 as requests for exception to policy. (T-1). Note: The approval process may be different when use of MILAIR is desired (see DoDI 4515.13, Section 3.6.e) 3.11.  Foreign Military Sales (FMS) Travel.  DoD personnel whose travel is funded by Foreign Military  Sales  (FMS)  case  money  provided  by  a  foreign  government  are  bound  by  the  normal routing for DoD travelers, unless otherwise stated in  the U.S.  Government,  Letter of Offer and Agreement.  These  terms  must  be  annotated  on  the  travel  orders;  otherwise  I  ITO/TMC  must procure transportation according to the order of precedence as specified in Chapter 2, paragraph 2.4,  producing  the  best  value  for  expending  funds.  (T-2).    Refer  to  AFMAN  16-101,  Internal Affairs  and  Security  Assistance  Management,  and  AFI  16-201,  Air  Force  Foreign  Disclosure and  Technology  Transfer  Program,  chapter  5,  paragraph  5.8,  for  more  information.  FMS-funded travel is chargeable directly to the FMS funds shown in the travel orders. FMS travel that is not funded by the U.S. Government is eligible for GSA Airline City Pair Program fares when the traveler is a DoD uniformed service member or a DoD civilian. Contractors may not use City Pair fares. 3.12.  Accompanied Baggage.  Accompanied baggage is the free checkable baggage authorized for movement with a traveler as part of their transportation ticket. Most Airlines no longer offer free checked baggage, therefore, official travelers should be prepared to pay the charge at check in and file for reimbursement on the travel voucher. Some airlines offer waivers for active duty military traveling on orders, but this is a courtesy, and is usually determined at the ticket counter. Each Airline Carrier’s baggage allowance vary therefore, travelers are encouraged to plan ahead and  contact  their  carrier  directly  or  visit  their  information  page  on  the  world  wide  web  to determine the allowed baggage before traveling. Baggage allowance rules for international travel on  foreign  carriers  vary  by  country.    Some  countries  calculate  baggage  allowance  using kilograms  instead  of  pounds  and  some  may  even  have  smaller  baggage  allowance.    Verify weight restrictions and the weight of your baggage with the airline before traveling. Note: Carrier baggage allowance vary therefore, passengers should refer questions to respective carriers for baggage allowance. 3.12.1.  Excess  accompanied  baggage  must  be  approved  by  the  orders  issuing  official/AO and annotated in the traveler’s orders, IAW AFI 65-103, AFI 65-109, AFI 65-114, and AFI 36-2102. Travel orders must be annotated with the following statement, “___pieces, ___lbs. of excess accompanied baggage authorized.” Travelers must pay the excess baggage charges directly to the servicing airline at the time of flight check-in and claim reimbursement on the travel voucher. (T-3). The preferred payment for excess baggage is the GTCC. 3.12.2.  Federal  Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  security  regulations  generally  prohibit travelers  from  carrying  operable  weapons  in  the  passenger  compartment  of  civil  aircraft during  peacetime.  Individual  airlines  may  grant  exceptions  to  their  regulations  when  a traveler  requires  a  weapon  for  official  duties  during  flight.  ITO/TMC  must  contact  the appropriate carrier when coordinating flight reservations to ensure authorized personnel may bring weapons aboard. (T-0). 3.12.3.  Code of Federal Regulations 14, Chapter 108, Part 108.11 permits carriers to allow DoD travelers to  carry  weapons in  passenger compartments  when the entire civil  aircraft is chartered or contracted for the military services during contingency operations or for training exercises. 40 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 3.12.4.  Commercial  airlines  may  permit  travelers  to  transport  government-owned  weapons and ammunition in baggage compartments when TMC or TO notifies the carrier in advance. Ammunition for individual weapons cannot be transported in checked baggage or as a carry-on on board AMC Patriot Express missions departing AMC gateways. Ammunition must be certified and shipped as freight from military installations. (T-0). 3.13.  Vehicle  Rental  .  The  base  ITO/TMC  is  responsible  for  obtaining  rental  vehicles  for official  travel  when  authorized  in  the  traveler’s  orders.  The  most  economical  vehicle  that satisfies  the  traveler’s  official  requirement  will  be  reserved.  The  TMC  will  consider  rental vehicles under the DoD Car Rental Agreement when making the reservations. (T-1). 3.13.1.  In  the  United  States  and  in  several  foreign  countries,  limited  collision  insurance  is available to travelers at no additional charge under the DoD Car Rental Agreement. Personal accident insurance, personal  effects  coverage, or other optional  coverage may be offered to the  renter  but  is  not  a  prerequisite  for  renting  a  vehicle,  and  its  cost  is  not  reimbursed.  In countries where theft insurance is a mandatory charge, those charges can be shown separately from the rental rate and collision damage waiver charges. Outside of the United States (and outside  non-foreign  OCONUS  areas),  travelers  may  be  reimbursed  for  these  additional charges if the insurance is required by the rental agency to provide full coverage insurance. In foreign OCONUS areas, travelers may be reimbursed for additional mandatory insurance coverage  charges.  Reimbursement  may  also  be  authorized  for  certain  classified  special operations.   Note: Air  Force travelers on official business  who rent  vehicles at  an overseas location  may  need  an  international  driver's  license,  which  they  can  obtain  from  most automobile clubs. 3.13.2.  The traveler must coordinate use of rental vehicles for other than official business or leisure time with the rental car companies. (T-1). Any additional charges or requirements for collision insurance are the sole responsibility of the traveler. 3.13.3.  Damage  to  rental  vehicles.  Requests  for  payment  for  damage  to  vehicles  rented pursuant to orders are approved by the orders authorizing official. The requests may be from the traveler or from the rental company. Prior to acting, the orders authorizing official must forward the request to the Staff Judge Advocate and DTMO for review. (T-1). 3.14.  Multiple  Airports  Servicing  CONUS  Origins/Destinations.  Passengers  should  not  be routed  to  an  airport  farther  away  from  origin  or  destination  airports  based  solely  on  a  lower airfare. When arranging transportation, the ITO/TMC must route passengers using the best value that meets mission requirements within established guidelines, local written policies and business rules  which  may  include,  but  not  limited  to,  authorized/establish  commuting  radius.  (T-1).  Per Diem,  travel  time,  most  direct  route,  authorized  GSA  contract  carrier  versus  alternate carrier/airport,  and  rental  car  costs  should  be  considered  in  factoring  best  value.  (T-1).  If  a traveler’s  request  does  not  follow  the  order  of  precedence  for  travel  in  paragraph  2.3,  or  the airfare is more expensive, the final determination rests with the AO/order issuing official. 3.14.1.  Routing when no Patriot Express (PE) mission is available.  When no PE mission is available,  the  member  is  entitled  to  commercial  air  transportation  from  the  closest international airport from the member’s current PDS to the member’s new PDS.  Passengers will  be  routed  using  GSA  City  Pair  Airfares  when  available,  or  the  Policy  Constructed commercial Airfares over the normally traveled route. (T-1). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 41 3.14.2.  Passengers  who  elect  to  deviate,  for  personal  reasons  (e.g.  leave),  from  the  normal prescribed  route  must  have  a”  Deviation  or  Leave  In-Conjunction  with  Official  Travel” memorandum  endorsed  by  the  ITO/TMC  specifying  the  governments  authorized  baseline travel  cost.  (T-1).  The  authorized  government  baseline  travel  cost  is  the  GSA  City  Pair through  fare  rate  for  travel  between  from  the  international  airport  closest  to  the  members current  PDS  to  the  international  airport  closest  to  the  member’s  new  PDS.    Note:  Any deviations  to  travel  that  involve  a  member  self-procuring  transoceanic  travel  must  be approved  by  the  servicing  MPS  and  annotated  in  the  member’s  travel  orders  for reimbursement. 3.14.3.  Members  requesting  government  transportation  for  the  transoceanic  travel  from  the CONUS must be routed from the following ports: For travel to Pacific Air Force (PACAF) installations,  use  Seattle  International  Airport.  (T-1).    For  travel  from  United  States  Air Forces  in  Europe  (USAFE)  and  United  States  Central  Command  (USCENTCOM) installations, use Baltimore-Washington International Airport. 3.14.4.  Members  requesting  government  transportation  for  the  transoceanic  travel  from OCONUS must be routed IAW DTR appendix O. (T-0). 3.14.5.  Routing  when  PE  mission  is  available  and  member  uses  alternate  modes  of transportation  (e.g.  self-procured  commercial  air)  to  the  APOE.    When  a  PE  mission  is available and the member uses alternate modes of transportation to the APOE, a “Deviation In-Conjunction with Official Travel" letter is not required.  Reimbursement of transportation costs to the APOE will be IAW JTR 5016. 3.15.  Travel  on  Military  Aircraft  (MILAIR)  .  Patriot  Express  is  an  AMC-contracted commercial  air  service  and  is  not  considered  MILAIR.  MILAIR  travel,  often  provided  by Operational Support Airlift (OSA), is a premium mode involving high cost and limited resources (reference  paragraph  3.18).  MILAIR  is  used  for  high-priority  missions  and  movement  of passengers and cargo to meet mission sensitive requirements. MILAIR should not be used when commercial  air,  including  AMC-contracted  (Patriot  Express)  service,  is  able  to  meet  the traveler’s departure and/or arrival requirements within a 24-hour period. Exceptions that would make  commercial  air  transportation  impractical  would  include  an  unusual  circumstance  that presents a clear and present danger, an emergency exists, use of MILAIR is more cost-effective than commercial air, or other similar compelling operational considerations. 3.15.1.  Required  Use  MILAIR  Travelers.  The  SECAF  and  CSAF  are  the  only  Air  Force required  users  as  designated  by  SECDEF  in  DoDD  4500.56  Enclosure  3.  Requesters  must document  their  travel  on  DD  Form  2768  and  sign  their  request  as  the  senior  traveler  and authorizing  official.  (T-0).  Due  to  the  continuous  requirement  for  secure  communications, security  reasons  or  for  responsive  transportation  to  satisfy  exceptional  scheduling requirements  dictated  by  frequent  short-notice is considered  unacceptable.  Reference  DoDD  4500.56,  enclosure  3  for  a  list  of  DoD  officials designated as “Required Users” (Tiers 1 & 2) by the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF). travel,  commercial transportation 3.15.2.  Use DD Form 2768, Military Air Passenger/Cargo Request, to obtain and document airlift  support.  Members  may  not  make  back-up  commercial  reservations  while  requesting any type of MILAIR support. (T-1). (Prohibition of Dual Commitment reference 3.1) 42 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 3.16.  MILAIR  Payment  .  ITO/TMC  must  ensure  all  travel  orders  contain  a  Customer Identification  Code  (CIC).  (T-1).  The  15-digit  CIC  code  is  required  only  for  travel  on  AMC owned or controlled aircraft for billing purpose;  not commercially contracted military by AMC (e.g. Patriot Express).  If the travel order does not contain a CIC, advise the traveler to, and/or, contact the AO to request amendments to the order. For contractor billing procedures, reference DoDI  4515.13,  Section  3,  paragraph  3.6-k.  For  non-DoD  traveler  billing  procedures,  reference the non-DoD tariff rates in GATES or the HQ AMC public information page on the worldwide web  at  U.S.  Government  DoD  Airlift  Rates  and  Non-U.S.  Government  Airlift  Rates.  In  cases where a CIC is unavailable, the complete billing address must be annotated in the travel order for AMC billing purposes. (T-1). 3.17.  Opportune  Airlift.  Opportune airlift is defined as the portion of lift capability available for  use  after  planned  requirements  have  been  met.  This  is  a  generic  term  for  all  MILAIR  not otherwise  classified  as  OSA,  Special  Assignment  Airlift  Mission  (SAAM),  AMC  channel, Special Airlift Mission (SAM), etc. It is space-available, non-revenue generating SAAM traffic. Use the procedures in DTR 4500.9-R, Part I, Appendix A and B for requesting a SAAM. Users may  submit  an  unsupported  travel  requirement  to  their  SAAM  validator.  They  may  also  find their own MILAIR (e.g., ANG, AFRES, operational, etc.) and submit the mission for validation to their SAAM validator. 3.18.  Operational Support Airlift (OSA)  . OSA is a form of MILAIR. See DoDI 4500.43 and DoDD 4500.56. 3.18.1.  Travelers  must  initiate  travel  request  by  completing  a  DD  Form  2768,  Military  Air Passenger/Cargo  Request.  (T-1).  The  senior  passenger  identified  on  the  request  must  sign the form in the Senior Traveler block; this action cannot be delegated.  (T-0). 3.18.2.  MILAIR  requests  for  all  Air  Force  personnel  must  be  approved  in  advance.  (T-1). SECAF  designates  the  following  Air  Force  approval  authorities  for  the  use  of  government aircraft  and  air  travel,  as  it  relates  to  the  approval  of  use  of  MILAIR  via  DD  Form  2768, Military  Air  Passenger/Cargo  Request  to  meet  DoD  Policy  requirements  (IAW,  DoDD 4500.56 and DoDI 4500.43). 3.18.2.1.  SECAF approves SAF/US and SAF/AA requests; 3.18.2.2.  SAF/AA approves Secretariat requests; 3.18.2.3.  CSAF approves AF/CV requests; 3.18.2.4.  AF/CV delegates to AF/A3 approval of MAJCOM/CC’s requests (when travel is primarily for Air Force purposes). AF/CV approves AF/CVA requests; 3.18.2.5.  AF/A3 approves Air Staff, FOA and DRU requests; 3.18.2.6.  MAJCOM/CCs approve their MAJCOM/CV requests; 3.18.2.7.  MAJCOM/CVs approve their MAJCOM staff and subordinate requests; and, 3.18.2.8.  Combatant  Commander  (COCOM)  approves  MAJCOM/CCs  requests  when travel is primarily for COCOM purposes. 3.18.2.9.  In  AF/A3’s  absence,  requests  in  paragraphs  3.18.2.4  and  3.18.2.5  will  be forwarded  to  AF/CV’s  office  for  action.  The  authorities  delegated  to  AF/A3  are  not further re-delegable. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 43 3.18.3.  All travelers (except those in PACAF and USAFE) submit their MILAIR requests to AF/A3Mfor validation and routing to the appropriate office for approval. 3.18.4.  MILAIR requests must include a commercial air cost estimate, full justification for use  of  MILAIR  and  a  statement  that  alternate  means  such  as  VTC  or  web-based communications  are  not  sufficiently  able  to  accomplish  travel  objectives.  (T-1).  See  DoDI 4500.43 and DoDD 4500.56, Enclosure 3 for determining commercial air travel costs. 3.19.  Common  User  Airlift  on  Operational  Support  Aircraft  (OSA)  Missions  .  Common User  Airlift  may  support  OSA  group  travel  requirements  (e.g.,  CAPSTONE,  TOPS  IN  BLUE, and CIVIC LEADER PROGRAMS) and other validated OSA missions. The Air Force supports such  missions  and  other  travel  requirements  as  Special  Assignment  Airlift  Missions  (SAAM). The  following  exception  applies  to  CAPSTONE  CONUS  Field  Trip  Travel  only:    "When CAPSTONE  fellows  are  moved  aboard  mobility  aircraft  for  the  purpose  of  demonstrating  the capabilities of the aircraft and the enroute support structure, the point-to-point transportation of the  fellows  becomes  incidental  to  the  capability  demonstration.  Therefore,  use  of  training missions  in  this  case  is  appropriate.  Training  flights  used  to  carry  CAPSTONE  fellows  should not include repetitive sorties on which the fellows are seeing similar elements of the Air Mobility Mission". 3.19.1.  Essential Air Mobility activities on such capability demonstration sorties (e.g., Intra- or  Inter-Theatre  airlift,  Airdrops,  and  Air  Refueling)  provide  aircrews  the  opportunity  to fulfill training requirements. On those capability demonstration missions identified by AMC for  CAPSTONE  courses,  training  missions  must  be  logged  using  training  hours.  (T-1).  All CAPSTONE  missions  are  handled  as  SAAMs  for  the  purposes  of  command  and  control  in order to ensure the success of these high-priority/visibility missions. 3.19.2.  MAJCOMS,  in  coordination  with  users,  must  program  funds  for  group  travel missions they sponsor, including civic leader groups.  HQ AMC must also POM for NON- MAJCOM  group  travel  SAAM  requirements  such  as  DOD,  HQ  USAF,  and  other  NON- MAJCOM sponsored OSA missions. 3.20.  Customs and Border Clearance  . OCONUS travelers must meet all customs and border clearance  requirements.  (T-1).  Travelers  must  have  passports,  visas,  immunization  records  and all other required travel  documentation in their possession before they begin their travel. (T-1).  See  DoD  4500.54-G,  AFI  24-401,  AFI  24-402,  AFI  24-403,  and  AFI  24-404  for  further guidance. 3.21.  Security Considerations for OCONUS Travel  . Security of DOD travelers overrides all other routing considerations. See DOD 4500.54-G for guidance. 3.22.  Entitlement  Extensions  for  Retirements  and  Separations.  Extension  requests  beyond established travel allowance expirations must clearly demonstrate hardship circumstances for the uniformed  service  member  and/or  dependents.  (T-1).  A  written  justification  along  with supporting  documentation  (i.e.,  proof  of  home  of  record,  place  of  entry,  medical,  educational, training,  spousal  employment,  housing,  etc.)  is  required.  The  Home  of  Selection  Travel  and Transportation  Entitlements  worksheet  is  required  prior  to  retirement.  Forward  extension requests to the following, based on the subject. Mailing Address: PPA HQ/PPEC 44 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 555 East Street, Suite 140 JBSA Randolph, Texas 78150E-Mail:  hqppa.ecaf-ext@us.af.mil 3.23.  Defense  Office  of  Hearing  and  Appeals  (DOHA)  Claims.  Under  31  USC§  3702, DOHA settles travel  and transportation claims for members of the uniformed services. Prior to July 1996, the General Accounting Office settled such claims under that statute. The Accounting and Finance Office is the point of contact for all DOHA claims. 3.24.  Application for Correction of Military Record.  The Air Force Board for Correction of Military Record (AFBCMR) is established under the authority contained in Title 10, US Code, Section  1552.  This  statutory  authority  is  the  highest  administrative  appeal  in  the  USAF  for reimbursing  official  travel  and  transportation  claims  including  DOHA  rulings  when  justified. The final determination is based on the information submitted to the AFBCMR, and each case is decided  only  after  careful  consideration  of  the  evidence  presented,  with  the  burden  of  proof resting  on  the  applicant.  MPS  is  the  POC  for  processing  DD  Form  149,  Application  for Correction  of  Military  Record.  See  AFI  36-2903,  Air  Force  Board  for  Correction  of  Military Records for processing instructions. 3.25.  Instructions to Travelers.  ITO/TMC brief all travelers on essential travel information on the following: 3.25.1.  Traveler's  responsibility  for  safeguarding,  handling,  and  using  all  travel  documents including carrier tickets, and meal tickets as applicable. 3.25.2.  Reservations, cancellations and overbooking policies. 3.25.3.  Routings,  itineraries,  transfer  points,  local  transportation  to  include  ground transportation,  and  rental  vehicles.  Traveler  may  keep  promotional  material  including frequent flyer miles and payments from the carrier for voluntarily vacating a seat. Additional per  diem  may  not  be  paid  as  a  result  of  the  delay  in  the  travel  in  this  case.  See  JTR,  pars. C1200 and C1205 for more detailed information. 3.25.4.  The traveler may not keep compensation for "denied boarding” when an airline does not  allow  a  traveler  to  board  an  overbooked  flight  the  airline  owes  the  government compensation. (T-1). Travelers must turn in any form of compensatory payment they receive from carriers to the finance office with their travel voucher. (T-1). Travelers must turn in any unused tickets to ITO/TMC at their permanent duty station. (T-1). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 45 Chapter 4 TEMPORARY DUTY (TDY) TRAVEL 4.1.  Temporary  Duty  (TDY)  Travel.  Air  is  the  primary  transportation  mode  for  DoD personnel.  Surface  transportation  may  be  approved  by  authorizing/order-issuing  official  or  a competent  authority  for  operational  requirements  (e.g.,  mission  must  be  performed  on  a  ship, medical, etc.), not for personal conveniences. 4.1.1.  TDY travel should originate from the most rate-favorable point serving the member’s duty station or place ordered to duty to obtain the best value travel arrangements for mission accomplishment.  Travel  orders  must  specify  where  authorized  travel  may  originate  and  list all  official  travel  segments.  (T-1).  Refer  to  JTR,  Chapter  4,  Part  G  For  privately  owned conveyance travel. 4.1.2.  Travelers  and  orders  issuing  official  must  ensure  maximum  utilization  of  Patriot Express  airlift  for  transoceanic  travel.  (T-1).  The  traveler  must  review  mission  needs  and validate the reason for non-use of Patriot Express airlift in writing to TO. (Use Attachment 2 for  Mission  Impact  Statement).  (T-1).  Unit  commanders/authorizing  officials  must  review and approve request.  (T-3). 4.1.3.  Squadron  commanders  or  equivalent  authority  must  approve  authorization  to  self-procure  transoceanic  transportation.  (T-3).  Sufficient  justification  must  be  maintained  with member  travel  records  for  auditing  purposes.  (T-3).  Approval  authority  must  not  be delegated.  (T-1).  TOs  must  provide  a  statement  only  if  the  traveler’s  official  travel requirements  cannot  be  satisfied.  (T-1).  Orders  must  be  annotated  with  the  following statement:  “Traveler  authorized transportation.” (Reference AFI 65-103, paragraph 3.3.16) (T-1). to  personally  procure transoceanic 4.1.4.  Travelers ordered to TDY while on Leave (JTR. Par. 4090-C) applies only if the need for the TDY is unknown to the member prior to the member’s departure on leave. If the TDY is known by the member before departure on leave, the member is reimbursed actual travel expenses not to exceed the constructed round-trip cost between the PDS and TDY location. City Pair airfares are not authorized for use to/from the leave point if the TDY requirement is known before leave has begun (APP P2). 4.2.  Leave-In-Conjunction  with  Official  (LICWO)  travel  refers only to  travel  in  connection with  TDY.  When  a  traveler  is  taking  leave-in-conjunction  with  official  TDY  travel,  use  of government  contract  airfares (e.g., YCA, _CA) and other government  fares (e.g., YMZ, MMZ, MDG, LDG, etc.) are strictly prohibited to and from leave points, unless the leave is at the TDY location,  then  travel  is  for  the  official  purposes,  not  the  leave.  These  fares  are  offered  by  the airline  industry  for  official  travel  purposes  only,  not  for  unfunded  leave  travel.  Most  airlines offer  military  members  special  or  discount  leave  fares.  The  traveler  must  schedule  all  official travel  through  the  ITO/TMC  to  ensure  appropriate  routing  and  reimbursement.  (T-1).  The ITO/TMC  must  establish  and  publish  local  procedures  for  obtaining  LICWO  travel  services based on their TMC contract and the method used for travel arrangements and ticketing.  (T-3). Reference DoDI 5154.31, Volume 4 for LICWO procedures and guidance. 4.2.1.  Installations with an Information, Ticket and Travel (ITT) office. Unless prohibited in the  DTMO  Contract  the  TMC  may  provide  arrangements  and  ticketing  for  both  the  leisure 46 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 and  official  travel  for  the  traveler  and  family  members  when  requested  by  the  official traveler.  Though  travelers  are  required  to  use  TMC  for  all  official  travel,  it  is  strictly  the individual’s  choice  to  arrange  LICWO  with  the  TMC.  The  traveler  may  also  elect  to  make leisure  travel  arrangements  through  the  ITT  office,  or  other  travel  reservation  resources. Note: Members are responsible for paying all additional fees above the official government cost. 4.2.2.  When unusual or emergency conditions exist, making use of the TMC impractical, or the TMC is unavailable/unable to provide the requested service, the ITO/TMC and FM must issue  a  non-availability  memo  (Attachment  4)  to  the  traveler  allowing  them  to  self-procure one-way or roundtrip tickets, whichever benefits the member, when approved in advance. (T-1). The memo must identify Government costs limits for the official portion of the trip, and preclude problems with the traveler obtaining proper reimbursement. (T-1). 4.2.3.  A  member  on  leave  and  ordered  to  return  to  a  duty  station  (permanent  or  TDY)  for duty generally must bear the cost of returning unless recalled for operational reasons as stated in the JTR 7045-B. (T-1). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 47 Chapter 5 PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION 5.1.  Permanent  Change  of  Station  (PCS)  Travel.  The  local  Military  Personnel  Section (MPS),  Civilian  Personnel  Office  (CPO)  and  the  TO  should  jointly  develop  procedures  for obtaining port calls information using  AF Form 1546, Request for Flight/Surface Reservations. This request should be submitted no later than 90 days prior to the member’s projected departure date.  The  ITO/TMC  secures  travel  reservations  and  provides  confirmed  flight  or  ship information back to the servicing MPS or CPO. 5.1.1.  It is Air Force policy to offer PCS travelers confirmed port call reservations optimally 60  days  and  minimally  45  days  prior  to  departure  from  the  old  PDS.  Delays  may  impose personal  hardships  for  service  members  or  civilian  employees  and  their  family  members. When  the  AMC  Passenger  Operations  Center  is  unable  to  confirm  a  reservation  within  a reasonable period of time or the member begins to experience hardships associated with not having a confirmed port call, the ITO should obtain commercial airline reservations to meet mission requirements. However, the ITO must ensure that DoD 4500.54-G or other directives do not otherwise restrict such travel.  (T-1). The guidelines for order of precedence must be followed. (T-1). 5.1.2.  The  MPS  provides  PCS  data  sheets  to  both  commanders  and  if  signed  by  the  losing commander, the port call may be changed and processed. The MPS or CPO initiates changes or cancellations for all port calls. 5.1.3.  When  dependents’  concurrent  travel  is  authorized  it  must  be  annotated  in  the member’s PCS order. (T-2). Family members with approved concurrent travel are authorized to  travel  at  any  time.    The  member  must  have  at  least  12  months  remaining  on  his/her DEROS  upon  arrival  of  the  dependents.    (T-2).  The  servicing  MPS  must  determine  when dependent travel orders will be published if dependents move separate from the sponsor. (T-2). 5.1.4.  Air Force members and DoD civilian employees and their authorized family members are  required  to  obtain  government-procured  transoceanic  travel  through  the  ITO/TMC. ITO/TMC  must  use  DoD  owned,  -controlled  or  -contracted  aircraft  to  move  travelers  to, from  and  within  overseas  areas,  when  available.  (T-1).  Self-procurement  of  transoceanic travel is not authorized unless specifically approved prior to travel and included in the orders. (T-1). 5.1.5.  POV transportation to/from Ports. See JTR paragraph 5352 and 5354.  See DTR Part IV, Appendix K-3, Paragraph X. 5.2.  Non-Command Sponsored Dependents  .  Reference DoDI 4515.13, Section 3, Paragraph 3.6.d. 5.3.  Transoceanic Travel by Ship (DTR 4500. 9-R; JTR, par. 3655)  . ITO/TMC must assist official  travelers  authorized  to  travel  via  ship.  (T-3).  Travelers  may  also  contact  the  DTMO  to request assistance with obtaining a list of vendors offering acceptable passenger service by ship if  needed.    On  ships  with  two  or  more  accommodation  classes,  use  the  lowest  class accommodations available. 48 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 5.3.1.  When approved in advance by MPS and included in the PCS orders, dependents of Air Force members may use ship transportation at government expense for PCS travel when they have  verification  of  a  medical  condition  precluding  travel  by  air.  Air  Force  members  may accompany  their  dependents  when  any  one  of  the  dependents  is  approved  to  use  surface travel.  If  the  verification  is  from  a  civilian  physician,  a  government  physician  must  also verify the need for surface travel. (T-1). 5.3.2.  Civilian  employees  or  their  dependents  may  use  surface  (vessels)  transportation  at government  expense  for  PCS  travel  when  they  have  verification  of  a  medical  condition precluding  travel  by  air.  If  the  verification  is  from  a  civilian  physician,  a  government physician  must  also  verify  the  need,  for  ship  travel.  (T-0).    Civilian  employees  may accompany  their  dependents  when  any  one  of  the  dependents  is  approved  to  use  surface travel per JTR para 5588. 5.3.3.  The  authorizing/order-issuing  official  must  include  authorization  for  movement  by ship in the travel order. (T-1). The ITO/TMC must instruct travelers to meet the port call to prevent  no-shows  and  have  passports,  visas,  immunization  records,  etc.,  in  their  possession before they begin  travel.  (T-2). The member must satisfy all border clearance requirements and obtain necessary travel and entry documents. (T-2). 5.4.  Pet  Shipments.  Pets  are  defined  as  cats  or  dogs  only.  Pet  shipment  on  AMC  flights  is limited  to  two  pets  per  family  in  permanent  change  of  station  status  only.  The  traveler  is responsible  for  all  expenses  related  to  the  pet  shipment  and  must  comply  with  the  carrier regulations. Reimbursement for shipping a pet is not authorized for military members however, civilian personnel are authorized IAW JTR 5768. The member may be reimbursed up to $550 for mandatory  pet  quarantine  incident  to  PCS.  Also,  the  traveler  must  ensure  all  general  entry  and health requirements are met prior to pet shipment. (T-1). ITO/TMC must assist with scheduling pets on AMC airlift (when included in TMC’s PWS in the contract). (T-2). The combined weight of pet and container up to 150 pounds must be charged as excess checked baggage.  (T-2). The cost  of  excess  baggage  varies  depending  on  the  AMC  channel  and  destination.  AMC  restricts weight for pets with kennels (container) up to 150 pounds. If pet spaces are unavailable or the pet exceeds  weight  restrictions  (to  include  kennel/container),  the  traveler  is  solely  responsible  for shipping the pet with a commercial airline carrier. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 49 Chapter 6 SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 6.1.  Renewal  Agreement  Travel  (RAT)  .  Civilian  employees  who  are  eligible  for  Renewal Agreement Travel (RAT) must obtain official travel orders from their servicing personnel office stating authorized travel locations and/or reimbursement allowance. (T-1). Employees may select an alternate point, but must be stated in the orders. (T-1). However, travel to the alternate point cannot  exceed  the  authorized  cost  for  travel  between  the  old  PDS  and  the  place  of  actual residence and return to the old or new PDS as the case may be. Multiple alternate points are not authorized.  Employees  must  arrange  their  travel  through  the  ITO/TMC.  (T-1).  Reference  the JTR, Chapter 7, Part A, Section 10. 6.2.  Consecutive  Overseas  Tour  (COT)  and  In-Place  COT  (IPOT)  Travel  .  Eligible members and their dependents  are authorized travel  and transportation for this funded leave, at government expense, between COT or IPCOT. Air Force members and their family may travel to their home of record (HOR) or to  any other point  not  to  exceed the cost of travel  to  the HOR.   Since this is government funded travel, use of GSA Airline City Pairs fares is authorized. Note: If the member  chooses an alternate destination (not  the authorized destination) more expensive than  transportation  to  the  HOR,  the  member  is  financially  responsible  for  the  additional  cost, unless  transportation  to  the  more  expensive  alternate  place  is  authorized/approved  by  the Secretarial Process.  In order to utilize the Secretarial Process instruct the members to contact the local  MPS  for  assistance  with  staffing  the  request  to  AF/A1PA,  to  staff  to  SAF/MR  if appropriate.  If  the  member  elects  to  travel  to  a  more  expensive  alternate  place  (and  the Secretarial  Process  has not  authorized/approved travel  to  that destination),  city pair airfares are not authorized for transportation to/from that alternate place. The traveler may not use a cruise or tour packages as a substitute for COT/IPCOT travel.   Members should visit their local  MPS to determine COT entitlements and eligibility. (See JTR, Paragraph. 7060). 6.3.  Funded  Emergency  Leave  (EL)  Travel  .  When  eligible  members  and  dependents permanently assigned to an OCONUS location receive notification of a family emergency away from  their  duty  station,  they  may  request  travel  orders  to  the  emergency  location.  Once  the member’s commander or the delegated authority has determined emergency travel is authorized, the member and/or family member(s) are entitled to government funded round-trip transportation in accordance with JTR, Paragraph.7010 and DTR 4500.9-R, Part 1, Chapter 102. See AFI 36- 3003,  Military  Leave  Program.  When  AMC  contracted  airlift  is  not  available,  commercial  air must be used. (T-1). Do not delay the EL traveler(s) pending available Patriot Express missions. Note: For personal emergencies for members in TDY status see JTR Paragraph 7015.  The TMC will compute a baseline/authorized travel cost using GSA City Pair from the PDS to the nearest CONUS international airport (See Table 6.1) and search GSA City Pairs, military furlough and public fares that best accommodate the traveler's desires (times, dates, and destination). (T-0). Table 6.1.  Closest CONUS International Airports to Determine Baseline Travel Cost USAFE BOSTON LOGAN IAP, MA PACAF (Excludes HAWAII) SEATTLE TACOMA IAP, WA 50 HAWAII AFCENT/AOR AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 SAN FRANCISCO IAP, CA BOSTON IAP, MA Note: This chart pertains to Air Force installations only.      6.3.1.  If the cost is cheaper to the EL destination vice the authorized baseline cost, the TMC may issue a ticket at no additional cost to the member (the member is authorized the use of City Pair fare if the cost is less than the baseline cost) (JTR 7010). 6.3.2.  If the cost to the EL destination is higher than the baseline, the TMC will annotate the PNR with the authorized cost and ensure member understands and pays the additional costs on  the  non-City  Pair  fare  (do  not  use  a  City  Pair  fare  if  it  is  higher  than  the  baseline  City Pair). (T-1). 6.3.3.  Use the member's GTC for EL travel costs whenever possible. 6.4.  Funded  Dependent  Student  Travel  . (JTR 5151-Member, JTR 7165-Employee) Eligible uniformed  service  members  and  employees  stationed  overseas  are  authorized  round-trip transportation  for  their  student  dependents  attending  formal  education  programs,  to  include vocational education. An annual trip for educational travel is one round-trip at any time within a fiscal  year  to  and  from  the  member’s  duty  station  (1  Oct  through  30  Sep).  Uniformed  service members  must  contact  their  personnel  office  for  program  details  and  funding.  (Employees) Travel to or from an alternate location may be authorized if cost-constructed so as not to exceed the contract fares (if available) between school and post (JTR 7165). (T-1). Note: The dependent student transportation entitlement does not apply to cadets attending service academies as stated in JTR, Paragraph. 5076-A.1. 6.5.  Transporting Human Remains, Escorts, and Relatives  of Personnel Attending Group Burials.  TO  and  mortuary  affair  officers  satisfy  travel  provisions  in  AFI  34-242,  Mortuary Affairs Program, JTR, Chapter 7, Part F. LRS-APS/PT must work closely with mortuary affairs for  arranging  transportation  of  human  remains.  (T-1).  Government  aircraft  is  normally  used  to move  human  remains  between  OCONUS  points  or  to  the  CONUS  aerial  port  of  debarkation (APOD), and in certain overseas locations, commercial air cargo are used. The normal mode for movement of human remains within CONUS is commercial air or other means that meet specific requirements. 6.5.1.  Escorts  (military  or  civilian).    Remains  of  deceased  Air  Force  military  personnel  or their family members are authorized travel as provided in the JTR, Paragraph. 7255. 6.5.2.  Remains of deceased civilian personnel are authorized travel as provided in the JTR, Paragraph. 7295 6.6.  Individual  Mobilization  Augmentee  (IMA).  IMAs  may  use  GSA  Airline  City  Pair Program  fares  when  traveling  to  perform  Inactive  Duty  Training,  IAW  DoDI  4515.16,  Use  of General  Services  Administration  (GSA)  Contracts  for  Air  Passenger  Transportation  Services (GSA  City  Pair  Program)  for  Attendance  at  Inactive  Duty  (IDT)  Assemblies.

Members  of  the  Air  Force  Reserves  and  Air National Guard coordinate travel arrangements when they receive orders to perform active duty. ITO/TMC  provides  round  trip  reservations  for  members  on  DoD  –owned,  -controlled,  or  – contracted aircraft when DoD service is not available to meet civilian employment commitments. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 51 6.8.  Non-Appropriated  Funds  (NAF)  Employees.  NAF  military  members  and  U.S.  civilian NAF  officials  or  employees  performing  official  travel  on  orders  are  mandatory  users  of  GSA Airline  City  Pair  Program  and  must  follow  the  order  of  precedence  for  air  travel  as  stated  in paragraph 2.3. (T-1). NAF contractors may not travel on ITAs, and cannot use GSA Airline City Pairs fares. NAF orders cannot be charged on an Air Force CBA. Non-U.S. citizen employees of NAF  activities  are  authorized  NAF  funded  transportation  in  overseas  areas  in  accordance  with the  terms  of  the  employment  contract.  NAF  travelers  may  travel  on  MILAIR  or  contracted aircraft when issued NAF travel orders. See DoDI 4515.13, Section 3 for additional information. 6.9.  Contractor Travel.  Government contractors may travel by MILAIR and AMC contracted chartered  aircraft  when  issued  a  Letter  of  Authorization/Identification  (LOA/LOI)  and  are eligible  under  DoDI  4515.13,  Section  3,  paragraph  3.6(k).  See  JTR,  Appendix  E,  Part  3,  for requirements  when  issuing  an  LOA.  Government  contractors  are  prohibited  from  using  GSA Airline City Pair Program fares. Contractors may submit an LOA to a vendor for a discount on rail, hotel/motel or car rental, however, the vendor is under no obligation to give the contractor a government discount. Some carriers may offer a reduced airfare. 6.10.  Air Force Aero-Club Aircraft or Other Fly-It-Yourself Rental Aircraft.  Use of rental aircraft  must  be  approved  in  the  travel  order  IAW  AFI  65-103.  (T-0).    TO  is  not  required  to make  arrangements  for  such  services  but  should  brief  travelers  on  authorized  reimbursements according to JTR, Chapter 3 Paragraph. 3405. 6.11.  Early  Return  of  Dependents  (ERD)  Travel  .  The  installation  commander  or  the commanding  officer  designated  by  the  Service  Secretary  concerned,  the  MPS  and/or  Unit Commander  may  authorize  return  of  OCONUS  command-sponsored  dependents.  Normally, requests are initiated by the sponsor and subject to approval on a case-by-case basis. The travel entitlement is from OCONUS to the place specified in the travel order (JTR Paragraph. 5096). 6.12.  Non Command Sponsored Dependents.  DoDI 4515.13, Section 3, Paragraph 3.6.d. 6.13.  Transoceanic  Travel  by  Ship  (surface).  TO  schedules  travel  through  the  TMC  that fulfills the traveler’s mission using the lowest class accommodations available on ships with two or more accommodation classes (DTR 4500. 9-R; JTR, Paragraph. 3655). 6.13.1.  Military  dependents,  civilian  employees  and  their  dependents  may  use  surface transportation  at  government  expense  for  PCS  travel  when  they  have  verification  of  a medical  condition  precluding  travel  by  air.  Military  members  may  accompany  their dependents  when  any  one  of  the  dependents  is  approved  to  use  surface  travel.  If  the verification  is  from  a  civilian  physician,  a  government  physician  must  also  verify  the  need for surface travel. 6.13.2.  The  orders-issuing  authority  or  authorizing  official  must  include  authorization  for ship movement in the travel order. (T-1). The ITO/TMC must instruct travelers to meet the port call and prevent no shows, and have passports, visas, immunization records, etc., in their possession before they begin travel. (T-2). 6.14.  Privately  Owned  Conveyance  (POC)  Travel  Involving  a  Car  Ferry.  Per  Diem  and reimbursement entitlements  can be found in  the  JTR, Paragraph. 3715. POC travel  of this type does  not  exhaust  the  POV  shipping  entitlement  in  the  JTR,  Paragraph.  5400  for  a  uniformed member. 52 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 Chapter 7 TRAVEL DOCUMENTATION AND BILLING 7.1.  General  .  Documentation  of  travel  with  associated  charges  and  payments  is  a  joint responsibility of the traveler, authorizing official, TO, TMC and FSO. Documentation, whether paper or electronic, is used for travel authorization, travel vendor charges and payments, traveler reimbursement,  auditing  purposes,  and  data  collection  for  management  information  system reports. 7.1.1.  In  an  effort  to  streamline  travel  policy  and  procedures,  MAJCOMs/AFIMSC  must issue policy and guidance on whether GTRs will be managed at commands or locally at TOs. Every  effort  must  be  made  to  eliminate  use  of  the  GTR  (SF  Form  1169)  to  the  maximum extent  possible.  (T-1).  The  elimination  of  the  GTRs  is  consistent  with  efforts  to  reengineer the transportation documentation and financial processes and to embrace charge vehicles for payment of transportation services. Thus, the preferred payment method for passenger travel is the Government Travel Card (GTC). 7.1.2.  Mandatory Use of the GTC. The Travel and Transportation Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-264) requires use of the GTC as the method of payment/reimbursement for official travel expenses. The GTC encompasses the Individually Billed Account (IBA), the Centrally Billed Account  (CBA)  and  the  Unit  Card.  The  requirement  for  mandatory  use  of  the  travel  card applies to uniformed service members, DoD civilian personnel, and members of the USAFR and ANG while in federal service (Title 10 status). Use of the IBA is the mandatory method of payment/reimbursement for cardholders. (T-0). 7.1.3.  Transportation charges are as follows. 7.1.3.1.  Transportation charges for airline, bus and rail tickets may be billed to the CBA. The local ITO/TMC must determine valid use of the CBA and reconciliation procedures. (T-1). 7.1.3.2.  Use  of  the  IBA  is  mandatory  as  a  method  of  reimbursement  for  official  travel associated charges where a charge card can be used such as: ticketing, lodging, rental car, meals, etc. The IBA can only be used to obtain ticketing and services directly associated with official government funded travel. 7.1.3.3.  The  Unit  Card  is  intended  for  use  in  group  travel  situations.  Examples  are presidential  aircrews,  academy athletic teams,  and bands. The unit card can be used  for official charges associated with travel. 7.1.3.4.  The traveler is required to use the TMC for making official travel arrangements and ticketing if the TMC is available. (T-0). When the TMC is available, but the traveler arranges  transportation  through  a  non-contract  travel  agent  or  common  carrier  direct purchase, reimbursement is limited to the amount the government would have paid if the arrangements had been made directly through a TMC. The IBA, CBA, and Unit Card are the  only  methods  of  payment  to  be  used  to  obtain  travel  services.  Note:  Advance approval by the AO is required for all travelers desiring to self-procure official travel, and it must be included in the official travel order. (T-0). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 53 7.1.3.5.  CBA and IBA Reconciliation and Refund Procedures. ITO, in conjunction with the  TMC  and  FSO,  must  develop  local  procedures  in  meeting  installation  requirements and guidelines outlined by the Prompt Payment Act. (T-1). 7.2.  Maintaining  Records  .  At  a  minimum,  ITO/TMC  must  retain  a  copy  of  orders  for  CBA and either a copy of the ticket, passenger name record (PNR), or AF Form 529, Request for Air Carrier Services, for each CBA transaction processed.  (T-0). Additional documentation such as justification  for  non-use  of  GSA  Airline  City  Pair  Program  fares,  Patriot  Express  missions impact  statements,  etc.  must  also  be  retained.  (T-2).  CBA  ticketing  documentation  must  be grouped  and  filed  together  for  reconciliation  purposes  and  forwarded  as  determined  by  the supporting FSO and DFAS Field Site. (T-1). There is no requirement to retain a copy of orders, PNR or additional documentation for tickets purchased via IBA. 7.3.  Control  of  Accountable  Forms.  ITOs  must  maintain  control  (until  exhausted)  of Government  Transportation  Request  (GTR,  (SF  1169),  Meal  Tickets,  Passenger  Warrants  such as blank GTRs (SF 1169), meal tickets, and Passenger Warrants (formerly MTWs) are examples of  accountable  forms.  Reference  DTR  4500.9R  Part  I,  Appendices  L-GTRs  and  M-Meal  for instructions  and  usage  of  GTR’s.  Dispose  of  records  in  accordance  with  AFI  33-364,  Records Disposition – Procedures and Responsibilities. 7.4.  Receiving  Unused  Travel  Documents.  ITOs/TMCs  receiving  unused  travel  documents must do the following: 7.4.1.  Document  receipt  for  unused  tickets  (Use  of  DD  Form  730,  Receipt  for  Unused Transportation Request and/or Tickets, including Unused Meal Tickets, is optional). (T-1). 7.4.2.  File the receipt per local procedures for receipt of unused tickets. (T-1). 7.4.3.  Send  the  receipt,  voided  unused  ticket(s)  and  other  pertinent  documentation  to  the issuing TOs/TMC for proper disposition.  (T-1). Mark "Canceled" or "Void" across the face of the original unused, damaged, or canceled GTRs (SF 1169), transportation warrants, and meal  tickets.  (T-1).  (Refer  to  DTR  4500.9-R,  Part  I,  Appendices  L-GTRs  and  M-Meal Tickets). Dispose of them in accordance with AFI 33-364 Records Disposition – Procedures and Responsibilities.  Dispose of the remaining copies as ordinary trash. 7.5.  Reporting Tickets or GTRs (SF 1169) Lost or Stolen  . ITOs who have blank GTRs (SF 1169)  lost  or  stolen  while  in  their  custody  must  immediately  notify,  in  writing,  their  local publication  distribution  office  (PDO),  and  their  appropriate  finance  office  (i.e.,  DFAS),  Offutt AFB, NE 68005-1920. Give the serial number or numbers of the missing GTRs (SF 1169) and circumstances surrounding the loss or theft. 7.6.  Furnishing  Transportation  to  Military  Personnel  without  Funds  (Cost-Charge Travel).  When members of the uniformed services report to Air Force bases without funds and need transportation to their duty station, ITO provides cost-charge transportation. 7.6.1.  Army  personnel:  DFAS  Centralized  Pay  Operation;  ATTN:  JUMPS  Cross- Disbursing, Dept. 20; Indianapolis, IN 46249-0601. 7.6.2.  Navy personnel: Disbursing officer of member's ship or station. 7.6.3.  Marine  Corps  personnel:  Marine  Corps  Finance  Center;  Code  (SD2R);  Kansas  City, MO 64197-0001. 54 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 7.6.4.  Coast Guard personnel: Commandant (FP), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 2nd St. SW, Washington, DC 20593. 7.6.5.  For members without orders, the ITO may issue transportation to active duty members without  funds  on  ordinary  leave,  AWOL,  deserters,  and  absentees,  to  return  to  their permanent duty station. ITO instructs the member to go to the base MPS for orders. The local MPS  must  issue  orders  containing  appropriations  cited  by  the  Headquarters,  Air  Force Personnel Center (AFPC). (T-1). An officer receiving cost-charge transportation must sign a certificate  (in  triplicate)  stating  that  they  agree  to  pay  the  cost  involved  or  authorize collection  from  their  pay,  give  the  original  certificate  to  the  member,  forward  a  copy  to servicing FSO, and place a copy in the file with the travel documents. (T-1). 7.6.6.  Air Force members receiving a cost-charge fund citation from AFPC do not require a DD Form 139 because the use of AFPC fund cites automatically generates collection actions against the member’s pay account. 7.7.  Processing  Unused  Tickets  for  Refunds.  Below  are  the  recommended  procedures  for processing  refunds;  however,  local  ITO/TMC  and  finance  office  may  implement  different procedures in accomplishing refunds. 7.7.1.  For installations without a TMC, complete a SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets, or  a  standard  memorandum  letter  and  attach  a  copy  of  the  lost  ticket  refund  application,  if available, and copies of the original tickets. Maintain a copy for your suspense for 120 days, and  send  the  original  documents  to  the  carrier.  The  SF  1170  can  be  found  on  the  General Service Administration information page on the worldwide web. 7.7.2.  Initiate tracer action on unanswered requests for refunds on the 121st day and each 90 days  thereafter,  for  up  to  one  year  from  date  of  the  initial  SF  1170.  If  the  carrier  fails  to respond within one year, forward all correspondences and documentation with the member's case  file  and  annotate  copy  of  SF  1170  with  the  statement,  "No  Response  Received  From Carrier,"  and  send  the  information  to  the  appropriate  DFAS  IAW  AFI  33-364  Records Disposition-Procedures and Responsibility. 7.7.3.  Installations  serviced  by  a  TMC.  The  ITO,  FSO,  and  TMC  must  jointly  agree  on Unused  Ticket  refund  procedures  or  as  specified  in  the  local  performance  work  statement outlined by contract. (T-2). 7.7.4.  The  issuing  office  may  follow  the  recommended  procedures  below  in  processing unused travel documents and ticket refunds: 7.7.5.  Receive unused portion of tickets and a copy of travel orders. 7.7.6.  Use  DD  Form  730  (optional)  or  locally  developed  form  (e.g.,  PNR,  stamp,  pre- printed labels, etc.). 7.7.7.  Annotate    form    with    pertinent    data    (e.g.,    unused    segments,    cost    of    unused segment, CBA, etc.). 7.7.8.  Void/cancel  original  unused  ticket  without  distorting  the  pre-printed  fare  basis  and ticket value. 7.7.9.  Advise  traveler  to  file  copy  of  receipt  with  travel  voucher  and  maintain  a  copy  for personal records. AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 55 7.7.10.  Mail    all    unused    documents    issued    at    other    installations    to    the    issuing ITO/TMC on a transmittal or other means for verifying receipt of accountable forms. 7.7.11.  Recommended refund procedures: 7.7.12.  Create a refund suspense list of all unused tickets for the established ticketing period (e.g., weekly, monthly, etc.). 7.7.13.  As a minimum, the suspense list should contain the traveler’s name, ticket number, and refund amount in duplicate copies. 7.7.14.  Provide  TMC  with  the  original  unused  tickets  and  a  copy  of  the  suspense  list  for processing at the end of the billing cycle (the average refund process takes 30 - 45 days). 7.7.15.  The ITO must follow-up on unprocessed ticket refunds beyond 45 days. (T-1). 7.7.16.  Upon receipt of billing documents, verify ticket refunds against TO suspense list and resolve discrepancies with TMC. 7.7.17.  ITO may make pen and ink changes to Element Expense Investment Codes (EEIC), (e.g. 409 to 421) rather than requiring an amended order. 7.8.  Local  Payment of Airlines  (LOPA)  Procedures.  Mostly phased out with the TTRA that require  travel  services  be  secured  with  a  Card,  which  is  the  CBA.  Only  a  few  OCONUS  sites (mostly in Southwest Asia locations) still use this method due to country restrictions.  See DTR 4500.9R, Appendix L, paragraph F. 7.9.  Meal Tickets Procedures.  See DTR 4500.9R, Appendix M. 7.10.  CBA  procedures.  The  CBA  is  used  as  the  method  of  payment  for  airline,  rail  and  bus tickets when: 7.10.1.  A  traveler  has  not  been  issued  an  Individually  Billed  Account  (IBA),  commonly referred to as a personal Government Travel Charge Card (GTCC). 7.10.2.  Traveling  as  a  group  (when  documented  proof  provided  that  no  IBA  has  been issued). 7.10.3.  Directed by AFIMSC/IZSL. 7.11.  To  preclude  travelers  from  mistakenly  requesting  reimbursement  when  the  CBA method of payment is used, the TMC will mark the traveler’s itinerary or ticket(s) with the method of payment.  (T-0). Tickets purchased using a CBA will state, “Airline ticket(s) paid by CBA, Non-Reimbursable to Traveler.” (T-0). Tickets purchased using an IBA will state, “Airline Ticket(s) paid by IBA, Reimbursable to Traveler”. (T-0). Note: The Passenger Name Record (PNR) invoice should not contain the CBA or IBA number.  7.11.1.  Except for travel arrangements made through the Defense Travel System (DTS), TO must  maintain  a  copy  of  the  PNR  invoice  and  a  copy  of  the  travel  authorization/order  for each ticket issued on the CBA. (T-0). These documents should be filed either by transaction date,  ticket  number  or  alphabetically  (traveler’s  name)  to  facilitate  reconciling  the  CBA invoice.  If  the  travel  authorization/order  is  processed  through  the  DTS,  there  is  no  need  to retain  a  copy  of  the  PNR  and  travel  authorization  because  they  are  stored  electronically 56 AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 within the DTS. However, optional retention of a copy of the PNR and travel authorization for DTS transactions, appropriately filed, may simplify the reconciliation process. 7.11.2.  When un-used or partially used tickets are returned to the ITO/TMC, documentation is  initiated  and  forwarded  to  the  airline/rail  company  for  the  appropriate  refund/credit.  The TO  must  establish  an  active  suspense  file  identifying  all  travel  transactions  due credits/refunds  from  the  airlines/rail  companies  for  tickets  charged  to  the  CBA.  (T-1). Tracking  must  be  accomplished  by  maintaining  paper  copy  documentation  files  and  by spreadsheet  or  another  quick  reference  product  that  provides  current  status  of  all credits/refunds  due.  (T-1).  At  a  minimum  the  tracking  product  requires  the  travel order/authorization number, traveler’s name, date a refund request was submitted, amount of credit  due,  and  the  date  refund/credit  was  received  as  identified  on  the  Government  Travel Card  Vendor  (GTCV)  invoice  report.  ITO  must  ensure  that  credits  due  appear  on  the GTCV’s  invoice  report  until  the  credit  is  received.  (T-1).  A  follow-up  process,  at  least monthly,  must  be  established  to  track  the  status  of  outstanding  credits  due  until  all  are received. (T-1). 7.12.  CBA Reconciliation Process 7.12.1.  The GTCV uploads an electronic copy of the invoice at the end of the billing cycle for  the  ITO  access,  download  and  print.  The  electronic  copy  of  the  GTCV  invoice  (bill) should be accessed online as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after the end of the billing cycle. When accessed, the invoice is date stamped. This date starts the clock for prompt payment. The payment due date is stated on the GTCV invoice (and is the date used for determining amounts past due and the account suspension date). The reconciliation must be completed and certified by the ITO within 10 workings days after receipt. (T-2). Note: If the online invoice is not accessible within 3 working days after the end of the billing cycle, ITO should contact the GTCV and advise of the issues with the online invoice.  7.12.2.  At  the  end  of  the  billing  cycle,  the  GTCV  sends  an  electronic  version  of  the  CBA invoice to the TMC for pre-reconciliation and to provide to the ITO. The electronic version provided  by  the  TMC  should  contain  the  same  data  as  the  GTCV’s  online  invoice  made available to the ITO. The TMC’s pre-reconciliation electronic invoice should be used to start the reconciliation rather than waiting for the paper copy. 7.12.3.  ITO must also monitor CBA transactions using DTS CBA conditional routing when available. (T-2) 7.12.4.  Based  on  the  TMC  contract,  the  TMC’s  participation  in  the  reconciliation  process varies. The ITO establishes written local procedures, in compliance with the contract, on the CBA  reconciliation  process  to  include  specific  TMC  and  ITO  responsibilities  and  time periods for accomplishment. 7.12.5.  The  CBA  reconciliation  process  as  a  minimum  must  include  the  following  (for AFIMSC applicable sites): 7.12.5.1.  CBA  documents  will  be  loaded  onto  the  AFIMSC/IZSL  SharePoint®.    (T-2). (Contact  AFIMSC/IZSL  for  upload  instructions  which  are  located  on  AFIMSC/IZSL SharePoint®). AFI24-101  28 APRIL 2017 57 7.12.5.2.  DFAS  will  download  documents  from  the  SharePoint®,  this  eliminates multiple delivery methods (mail, e-portal, etc.) 7.12.5.3.  Any deviations from using SharePoint® must be approved by AFIMSC/IZSL. (T-2)  JOHN A.
